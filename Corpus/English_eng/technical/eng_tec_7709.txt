EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
EFFICIB
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Efficib?
Efficib is a medicine containing two active substances, sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride.
It is available as capsule-shaped tablets (pink:
50 mg sitagliptin and 850 mg metformin hydrochloride; red:
50 mg sitagliptin and 1000 mg metformin hydrochloride).
What is Efficib used for?
Efficib is used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes, to improve control of blood sugar levels.
It is used with diet and exercise: • in patients who are not satisfactorily controlled on metformin (an antidiabetes medicine) alone; • in patients who are already taking a combination of sitagliptin and metformin as separate tablets; • in combination with a sulphonylurea (another type of antidiabetes medicine) when the combination of a sulphonylurea and metformin is not sufficient to give satisfactory control of the patient’ s diabetes.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Efficib used?
Efficib is taken twice a day.
The strength of tablet to use depends on the dose of the other antidiabetes medicines that the patient was taking before.
Patients already taking metformin, with or without a sulphonylurea, should take Efficib containing the same dose of metformin.
Patients already taking sitagliptin and metformin as separate tablets should switch to Efficib containing the same doses of both active substances.
If Efficib is taken with a sulphonylurea, the dose of the sulphonylurea may need to be lowered, to avoid hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels).
The maximum dose of sitagliptin is 100 mg a day.
Efficib should be taken with food to avoid any stomach problems caused by metformin.
Efficib is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age because of a lack of information on safety and effectiveness in this group.
How does Efficib work?
Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which the pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood or when the body is unable to use insulin effectively.
The active substances in Efficib, sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride, each have a different mode of action.
Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor.
It works by blocking the breakdown of 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

These hormones are released after a meal and stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin.
By increasing the levels of incretin hormones in the blood, sitagliptin stimulates the pancreas to produce more insulin when blood glucose levels are high.
Sitagliptin does not work when the blood glucose is low.
Sitagliptin also reduces the amount of glucose made by the liver, by increasing insulin levels and decreasing the levels of the hormone glucagon.
Metformin works mainly by inhibiting glucose production and reducing its absorption in the gut.
As a result of the action of both active substances, blood glucose levels are reduced and this helps to control type 2 diabetes.
How has Efficib been studied?
Sitagliptin on its own has been approved by the European Union (EU) under the name Januvia since 2007.
Januvia can be used with metformin, and with both metformin and a sulphonylurea, in type 2 diabetes patients.
Three studies of Januvia, in patients with type 2 diabetes whose blood glucose levels were not adequately controlled on metformin alone, were used to support the use of Efficib in the same indications.
Two of the studies compared sitagliptin as an add-on to metformin with placebo (in 701 patients) and with glipizide (a sulphonylurea) (in 1,172 patients).
The third study compared sitagliptin with placebo, when used as an add-on to glimepiride (another sulphonylurea), with or without metformin, in 441 patients.
The results of one new study in patients who did not take antidiabetes medicines before were also presented, comparing the effect of sitagliptin plus metformin with that of metformin alone or sitagliptin alone.
All of the studies measured the change in the levels after 24 weeks of a substance in the blood called glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), which gives an indication of how well the blood glucose is controlled.
Two ‘ bioequivalence’ studies were also carried out, showing that the active substances in the two strengths of Efficib were absorbed in the body in the same way as when they were taken as separate tablets.
What benefit has Efficib shown during the studies?
Sitagliptin taken in combination with metformin was more effective than metformin alone.
The addition of 100 mg sitagliptin to metformin reduced HbA1c levels by 0.67% (from around 8.0%) after 24 weeks, compared with a fall of 0.02% in the patients adding placebo.
The effectiveness of adding sitagliptin to metformin was similar to that of glipizide in reducing the levels of HbA1c.
In the study where sitagliptin was added to glimepiride and metformin, the levels of HbA1c were reduced by 0.59% after 24 weeks, compared with an increase of 0.30% in the patients adding placebo.
In the new study, the combination of sitagliptin plus metformin was more effective than metformin or sitagliptin alone.
What is the risk associated with Efficib?
The most common side effect with Efficib (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) is nausea (feeling sick).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Efficib, see the Package Leaflet.
Efficib should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to sitagliptin, metformin or any of the other ingredients.
It should also not be used in patients who have diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of ketones and acids in the blood), diabetic pre-coma, problems with their kidneys or liver, conditions that may affect the kidneys, or a disease that causes a reduced supply of oxygen to the tissues such as failure of the heart or lungs or a recent heart attack.
It should also not be used in patients with alcohol intoxication (excessive alcohol consumption) or alcoholism, or during breast- feeding.
For the full list of restrictions, see the Package Leaflet.
Why has Efficib been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Efficib’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The Committee recommended that Efficib be given marketing authorisation.

The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Efficib to Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd on 16 July 2008.
