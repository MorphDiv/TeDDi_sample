Not really & kde; -related, but frequently asked nevertheless.
How do I change the screen resolution?
Use Ctrl; Alt; + and Ctrl; Alt; - to cycle through the resolutions you have defined in XF86Config (maybe under / etc/ X11; poke around first). If you prefer to get your hands dirty, you can always edit the file directly. By placing your favorite resolution at the beginning (or making it the only one listed), & X-Window; will always start up with that resolution.
Always make a backup copy of your XF86Config file before you start editing it. Errors in this file can render & X-Window; unusable.
These instructions are only valid if you are running version 3.3. x of the XFree86 server. If you are running XFree86 4. x, you must consult with the XFree86(TM): Home Page.
How do I change the color depth?
There is no way you can do this on the fly. You can either start & X-Window; using startx -bpp number where number can be 8, 16, 24 or 32, depending on the depth you want. Alternatively, if you are using xdm / kdm;, you need to edit / etc/ X11/ xdm/ Xservers (may vary) and enter :0 local / usr/ X11R6/ bin/ X -bpp 16 for 16 bit color depth.
You can also edit the XF86Config file and add a line like DefaultColorDepth number to Section "Screen". The next time you start X, it will run with the newly-configured color depth.
What can I do if I am using a 2-button mouse?
Go buy a 3-button one, or use third button emulation. The third button is emulated by pressing both the & LMB; and the & RMB; together. You would need to enable Emulate3Buttons in your XF86Config file.
What is a "sticky" window?
In a virtual desktop environment with multiple virtual desktops, a "sticky" window will stay put on the screen when you switch between desktops, as if sticking to the glass of the screen. Xclock is a typical candidate for sticking, as you need to run only one instance of it, and it always stays with you.
How do I extract/ install diff files?
To generate a context-diff suitable for patching, use diff -u old-file new-file & gt; patchfile. To apply the diff to a file (i. e. "patch the file"), execute patch & lt; patchfile.
How do I get & Linux; to mount the floppy device for use with both DOS and ext2 formatted floppies?
Just specify the filesystem type as auto in / etc/ fstab. Auto detection works fine for DOS and ext2.
How do I start & kde; with the Num Lock on?
Open the & kcontrolcenter; and navigate to Peripherals Keyboard. Under the section NumLock on & kde; Startup move the radio button to select Turn on
How do I take window or desktop screenshots?
Use & ksnapshot;.
Is there a tool to make webpages?
Yes, and there are a lot of them out there, including StarOffice, Netscape; Composer, and XEmacs. There are also many & kde; applications. To find the most current list, go to kde-apps. org: The Latest in & kde; Applications and search for web development. Try as many as possible and choose the one most suitable to your needs.
What do all those acronyms like AFAIK mean?
AAMOF: as a matter of fact AFAIK: as far as I know AISE: as I see it BFN: bye for now BION: believe it or not BRB: be right back BTW: by the way CMIIW: correct me if I am wrong FUD: fear, uncertainty, and doubt FWIW: for what it's worth FYI: for your information HTH: hope this helps IIRC: if I recall correctly IMHO: in my humble opinion LOL: laughing out loud MYOB: mind your own business PITA: pain in the ass ROTFL: rolling on the floor laughing RTFM: read the fine manual SOP: standard operating procedure TIA: thanks in advance YMMV: your mileage may vary
