4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target Species
Dogs (bitches).
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
The treatment of hormone-dependent urinary incontinence due to sphincter mechanism incompetence in ovariohysterectomised bitches.
4.3 Contraindications
Do not use in intact bitches, as the efficacy has only been established in ovariohysterectomised bitches.
Animals showing a polyuria-polydipsia should not be treated with Incurin.
The use of Incurin is contraindicated during pregnancy and in animals younger than 1 year.
4.4 Special warnings for each target species
High doses of oestrogen may have a tumour-promoting effect in target organs with oestrogen receptors (mammary glands).
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals In case of oestrogenic effects, the dose should be lowered.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals Not applicable.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Oestrogenic effects such as swollen vulva, swollen mammary glands and/ or attractiveness to males and vomiting have been observed at the highest recommended dose of 2 mg per dog.
The incidence is about 5- 9%.
These effects are reversible after lowering the dose.
In rare cases vaginal bleeding occurred.
In very rare cases development of alopecia has also been observed.
2/ 15 4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Not applicable.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
None known.
4.9 Amount(s) to be administered and administration route
For oral administration.
A relationship between final effective dose and body weight has not been established and therefore the dose has to be determined for each dog on an individual basis.
The following dosing schedule is advised: start treatment with 1 tablet (1 mg estriol) every day.
If treatment is successful, lower the dose to half a tablet a day.
If treatment is not successful, increase the dose to 2 tablets a day to be given in one dose.
Some dogs do not need daily treatment; treatment every other day may be tried, once the effective daily dose has been established.
The minimum dose given should not be less than 0.5 mg per dog per day.
Ensure the dose used to achieve the therapeutic effect is as low as possible.
Do not use more than 2 tablets per dog per day.
If no response to treatment is obtained the diagnosis should be reconsidered in order to investigate other causes for the incontinence such as neurological disorders, bladder neoplasia, etc.
Animals should be re-examined every 6 months during treatment.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
In case of overdose typical oestrogen effects may occur.
These effects are reversible after lowering the dose.
4.11 Withdrawal periods
Not applicable.
5.

This is probably due to the short-acting oestrogenic character of estriol.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
After oral administration of multiple doses no accumulation occurs.
