DateValue function
DateValue Function [Run-time]
Returns a date value from a date string.
The date string is a complete date in a single numerical value.
You can also use this serial number to determine the difference between two dates.
Syntax:
DateValue [(date)]
Return value:
Date
Parameters:
Date:
String expression that contains the date that you want to calculate.
The date can be specified in almost any format.
You can use this function to convert a date that occurs between 1st December 1582 and 31st December 9999 into a single integer value.
You can then use this value to calculate the difference between two dates.
If the date argument lies outside the acceptable range, $[officename] Basic returns an error message.
In contrast to the DateSerial function that passes years, months and days as separate numerical values, the DateValue function passes the date using the format &quot; month.[,]day.[,]year &quot; .
Example:
Sub ExampleDateValue
msgbox DateValue( &quot; 12/02/1997 &quot; )
end sub
