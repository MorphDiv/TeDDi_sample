The function creates a new brush and returns a handle to it.
A brush is used to fill shapes.
For an example see printer_select_brush(). color must be a color in RGB hex format, i.e. "000000 "for black, style must be one of the following constants:
PRINTER_BRUSH_SOLID: creates a brush with a solid color.
PRINTER_BRUSH_DIAGONAL: creates a brush with a 45-degree upward left-to-right hatch (/).
PRINTER_BRUSH_CROSS: creates a brush with a cross hatch (+).
PRINTER_BRUSH_DIAGCROSS: creates a brush with a 45 cross hatch (x).
PRINTER_BRUSH_FDIAGONAL: creates a brush with a 45-degree downward left-to-right hatch (\).
PRINTER_BRUSH_HORIZONTAL: creates a brush with a horizontal hatch (-).
PRINTER_BRUSH_VERTICAL: creates a brush with a vertical hatch (|).
PRINTER_BRUSH_CUSTOM: creates a custom brush from an BMP file.
The second parameter is used to specify the BMP instead of the RGB color code.
