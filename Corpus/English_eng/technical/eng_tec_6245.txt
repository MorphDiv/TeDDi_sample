& kmag; is a screen magnifier. You can use & kmag; to magnify a part of the screen just as you would use a lens to magnify a newspaper fine-print or a photograph. This application is useful for a variety of people: from researchers to artists to web-designers to people with low vision. This document will try to be a complete reference manual for using & kmag;.
KDE
kmag
K Magnifier
Introduction
& kmag; is a screen magnifier for the K Desktop Environment (kde;). It can be used to magnify a part of the screen. This application can be useful to various people: People with low vision can use this application to magnify a part of the screen which they are unable to view clearly, artists can use this application to zoom into the graphics they produce and verify it at the pixel level, image-processing researchers can use this application to zoom into images and study them closely. Other than these, & kmag; can be used for various other purposes & eg; is possible to use the application for grabbing a portion of the screen and saving it to the disk (with an option of zooming the screen captured).
& kmag; is a very powerful application with new features being added all the time. It is optimized for use on low processing power machines.
Using & kmag;
Here's a screen shot of & kmag;
Screen shot of & kmag;
After running & kmag; you will get a window similar to the one show above. The main window of & kmag; shows the magnified (or zoomed) contents. We refer to this window as the zoom window. The zoomed image shown inside the zoom window is captured from a part of the screen. The part of the screen which is magnified is referred to as the selection window.
By default, & kmag; magnifies the region around the mouse cursor into the zoom window (think of it as a moving lens). Alternatively, you can ask & kmag; to magnify an chosen area of the screen into the zoom window (Selection Window Mode), or the area around the mouse cursur to one of the screen edges (e. g. Left Screen Edge Mode).
If you would prefer not to see the mouse cursor in the zoomed image, select Hide Mouse Cursor. Please note that & kmag; cannot yet find out the current cursor shape. Thus, it shows the default & kde; /Qt; cursor.
Changing the part of the screen to be magnified
When in Selection Window Mode, the selection window can be moved and resized. You can also change the position and size of the selection window using the arrow keys on the keyboard, or by clicking into the zoom window:
Arrow keys or & LMB;
By keeping the left mouse button pressed and moving the mouse, you can grab and drag the contents of the zoom window. You can also use the arrow keys.
Shift; Arrow Keys or & Shift; LMB; or & MMB;.
By additionally pressing & Shift; or using the & MMB;, you can move the selection window.
Ctrl; Arrow Keys or & Ctrl; LMB;
By using this combination, you can resize the selection window. Keep in mind that the top-left corner of the selection window is kept constant and the bottom-right corner is movable.
More & kmag; features
& kmag; comes with lots of features. It is possible to print the zoomed image directly to a printer, save the image to a file, copy the zoomed image to the clipboard (which can be used later to paste in other applications), rotate the magnification image and more.
