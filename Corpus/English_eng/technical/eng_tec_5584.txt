& Setup %1
& Preview %1
Selecting the Setup or Preview option may cause the panel and/ or the desktop to be temporarily shut down. To prevent data loss please make sure you are not actively using these components.
Attention
Setup %1
Configure Kiosk Admin Tool
General
Generic restrictions
Disable Window Manager context menu (Alt-F3)
The Window Manager context menu is normally shown when Alt-F3 is pressed or when the menu button on the window frame is pressed.
Disable Bookmarks
Disable Bookmarks in all applications.
Disable all tasks and applications that require root access
In multi-user environments the users normally do not know the root password; in such a case, it may be desirable to use this option to remove the tasks and applications from the menus that the users cannot use.
Disable access to a command shell
In an environment where the desktop is dedicated to a defined set of tasks it may be desirable to disable access to a command shell to prevent users from engaging in tasks that were not intended or authorized; hence, it is strongly recommended to disable access to a command shell if the desktop is to act as a public terminal.
Disable Logout option
This prevents the user from logging out. To make this option effective it is important to ensure that key-combinations to terminate the X-server, such as Alt-Ctrl-Backspace, are disabled in the configuration of the X-server.
Disable Lock Screen option
When the desktop is to act as a public terminal or is to be shared by different users it may be desirable to prevent locking of the screen to ensure that the system remains accessible if a user leaves the terminal.
Disable "Run Command" option (Alt-F2)
The "Run Command" option can normally be used to execute arbitrary commands; however, when access to a command shell is restricted only applications and services defined by a. desktop file can be started this way. Disabling "Run Command" here hides the option completely.
Disable toolbar moving
Normally toolbars in applications can be moved around; when this option is chosen all toolbars are fixed in their original positions.
Disable execution of arbitrary. desktop files
This option defines whether users may execute. desktop files that are not part of the system-wide desktop icons, KDE menu, registered services or autostart services. When access to a command shell is restricted it is recommended to disable the execution of arbitrary. desktop files as well since such. desktop files can be used to circumvent the command shell restriction.
Disable starting of a second X session
KDM has the possibility to login a second user in parallel to the current session. Note that this can also be configured as part of the KDM settings in which case the setting here should be left enabled.
Disable input line history
If a single account is used by multiple people it may be desirable to disable the input line history out of privacy considerations.
Enforce DRM restrictions
Some KDE applications can enforce DRM restrictions on content. You may want to enable this if your organisation relies on such restrictions or if local law requires it.
Prevent Downloading
Some KDE applications can prevent the user from downloading or uploading files. The normal web browsing experience will not be affected. Note that you still have to set up the unix file permissions correctly - treat this as merely cosmetic for security.
Desktop Icons
Desktop Icons are provided by "kdesktop".
Lock down Desktop Settings
When the desktop settings are locked down the user can no longer change how the desktop behaves or what it looks like. This does not affect the ability to add new files or shortcuts to the desktop.

Lock down all Desktop icons
When checked the user will not be able to remove or edit any existing icons or files on the Desktop, or add any new icons or files.
Lock down system-wide Desktop icons
When checked the user will not be able to remove or edit any of the system-wide icons but will still be able to add, remove or edit personal icons or files on the desktop.

OpenGL-based screen savers may cause problems on systems without decent OpenGL support; with this option all such screensavers can be disabled.
Discreet Screen Savers Only
Some screensavers do not hide the complete screen content and may leave possible sensitive information visible. This option disables all such screensavers and only enables those screensavers that completely hide the original content of the screen.
KDE Menu
The KDE Application menu
This option disables all menu items that require root access and that will ask the user for the root password.

Your system contains KDE configuration settings in the skeleton directory %1. These files are copied to the personal KDE settings directory of newly created users. This may interfere with the correct operation of user profiles. Unless a setting has been locked down, settings that have been copied to the personal KDE settings directory of a user will override a default setting configured in a profile. If this is not the intended behavior, please remove the offending files from the skeleton folder on all systems that you want to administer with user profiles. The following files were found under %2:
