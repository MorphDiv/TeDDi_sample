The Editor

tik@acm. org
ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
The editor is based on & designer;, a tool for designing and implementing user interfaces created by Trolltech. We have modified & designer; in the following ways:
Its interface is much simpler
Built in our own widgets
Added the ability to setup & kommander; Text
Various other superficial changes
For those of you already familiar with using & designer;, using the & kmdr-editor; will be trivial.
