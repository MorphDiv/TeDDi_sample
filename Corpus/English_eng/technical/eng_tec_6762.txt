Non-existent metatags are expanded to empty strings.
Ranges
Ranges are a method of accessing a part of a string. The concept of ranges is based on python slices.
A range (start_index:end_index) starts at the start_index and finishes one character before the end_index.
Range syntax
(start_index:end_index)


If one of the indices is dropped, it is assumed that you want everything in that direction. I.e. (:3) means "every character from the beginning of the string up to character 3, non-inclusive." (3:) would, on the other hand, mean "every character from the string, starting at character 3 (inclusive) up to, and including, the last one." If index is negative, it is relative to the end of the string. Index -3 stands for "the third character from the end of the string".
Position of the first letter is '0'.

%+
The date and time in date format
%%
A literal "%" character
Some conversion specifiers can be modified by preceding them by the E or O modifier to indicate that an alternative format should be used. If the alternative format or specification does not exist for the current locale, the behaviour will be as if the unmodified conversion specification were used. The Single Unix Specification mentions %Ec, %EC, %Ex, %EX, %Ey, %EY, %Od, %Oe, %OH, %OI, %Om, %OM, %OS, %Ou, %OU, %OV, %Ow, %OW, %Oy, where the effect of the O modifier is to use alternative numeric symbols (say, roman numerals), and that of the E modifier is to use a locale-dependent alternative representation.

Python Plugins
GNOME Commander is capable of executing python plugins. A Python plugin is a normal python application containing a predefined entry function.
GNOME Commander comes with built-in plugins:



Working with plugins
To start - simply place your plugin in
Plugins will be added as new entries to the GNOME Commander context menus.
Keyboard shortcuts can be assigned to execute specific python plugins (eg.
Python plugins requirements
build
python-devel ⩾ 2.4
run
python ⩾ 2.4
gnome-python2-gnomevfs
pygtk (for GUI)
Plugins API
The entry (start) point for plugin is always main() function:
def main(main_wnd_xid, active_cwd, inactive_cwd, selected_files)
where parameters are:
main_wnd_xid
XID of GNOME Commander main toplevel window
active_cwd
full path of current dir of active pane
inactive_cwd
full path of current dir of inactive pane
selected_files
list of selected
Sample plugin: md5sum
#!/usr/bin/env python

 try:
 import gnomevfs
 except ImportError:
 import gnome.vfs as gnomevfs

 import os
 import string
 import hashlib

 def main(main_wnd_xid, active_cwd, inactive_cwd, selected_files):

 parent_dir = string.split(active_cwd, os.sep)[-1]
 if parent_dir=='':
 parent_dir = 'root'
 f_md5sum = file(inactive_cwd+os.sep+parent_dir+'.md5sum', 'w')
 for uri in selected_files:
 if gnomevfs.get_file_info(uri).type==gnomevfs.FILE_TYPE_REGULAR:
 f = file(active_cwd+os.sep+uri.short_name, 'rb')
 file_content = f.read()
 f.close()
 md5sum = hashlib.md5(file_content).hexdigest()
 f_md5sum.write('%s %s\
' % (md5sum, uri.short_name))
 f_md5sum.close()
 
 return True

Tips and Tricks
Some very simple tips and tricks on using and getting the most out of GNOME Commander.
Handling Archives
GNOME Commander still lacks built in browsing of compressed archives. However the program can be configured so that working with archives becomes quite practical anyway.
There are two different ways: The preferred one is to activate the build in
The second, outdated but still working way is the following:
If you don't already have the program
Open the
Add two favorite apps using the values shown in the figures below.
You can now right click any file or folder and choose
Create Archive
This entry allows creating archives easily.
Extract Archive
This entry allows extract archives easily.
Using removable media
This info might be partially outdated since modern desktop environments or Linux distributions use automounters to mount devices into /media.
If you use removable devices such as CDs, floppies and cameras a lot you can make GNOME Commander automatically take care of mounting them by following this guide:
Open the
Add the devices that you are using. This is how the program looks with a few added devices.
Mounting in GNOME Commander.
In the last image the red circle
There is also an option to skip mounting in the option device tab. This can be useful for making shortcuts to directories, or if you have some automounting feature that mounts it at its mountpoint when available, or if you use Supermount that does it on access basis.
Using Nautilus icon theme
This is outdated info since Nautilus and later GNOME versions no longer use these kind of themes.
The default icon theme that comes with GNOME Commander lacks icons for a lot of file types and only looks good at icon size 16. There are other themes around though, that are more complete and looks better in bigger sizes. Unscalable Gorilla by Jimmac is one example and can be used in GNOME Commander by following these steps:
Download the theme.
Unpack the theme to where ever you want.
Start GNOME Commander open the
When you now close the
Handling MIME types
Since GNOME has changed to follow the freedesktop.org standard of handling mimetypes, the editing of preferred programs in GNOME Commander is broken (since v1.1.7). You have still some possibilities to change preferred default programs. For more informations please have a look at the
GNOME Commander Installation
Getting GNOME Commander
It's recommended to use the GNOME Commander package that is provided by your distribution. Refer to GNOME Commander for the
All current and historical releases can be found on the
Versioning
GNOME Commander is being developed in a stable and a testing branch, where the test releases fill the purpose of testing new ideas. Successful ones will then get backported to the stable branch. The version numbers (major, minor and micro) follows the quite usual standard of odd and even versioning, where odd minor versions stands for the unstable releases and the even numbered branch eventually gets the thoroughly tested new functions backported.
Current stable version
If you'd like to compile the latest stable version of GNOME Commander yourself, get it as a tar.xz file from the
After extracting the archive, first have a look at the
Development version
For those of you who feel really adventurous, or maybe want to hack on the freshest code, the latest development source snapshots are available by using GIT:
git clone git://git.gnome.org/gnome-commander
The above works only to do a first time download and not for updating the code, if you already have a version of the code simply run
Just remember to run
Be aware that there can be serious bugs in code from GNOME git repository. This code is intended for hacking, development and testing purposes only.

Known Bugs and Limitations
You can report or view GNOME Commander bugs at the
Some words about bugs: Though GNOME Commander is relatively free from bugs and is a quite mature program, no programs will ever be totally bug free. New bugs can be introduced with new features, or through other programs and libraries it depends on, this goes especially for development and testing versions. Quality bug reporting is very important and can be a very good help for the developers to make a better program. Bug reporting is not an act of dissatisfaction, so you are very welcome to help us find, hunt down and kill the bugs. Testing of the new releases and bug reporting is the best way users without programming knowledge can help out in the development of a program, and those with programming knowledge are very welcome to suggest fixes and/or send patches to the developers, all in the spirit of free and open source software.
GNOME Commander is still lacking on GVFS/GIO support. Instead it uses GnomeVFS. This might be the cause that some Python plugins won't run on your system.
Configuration of default application depending on the files MIME type is broken and was finally removed in v1.4. See section
Known limitation:
Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.

History of GNOME Commander
GNOME Commander was primarily written by Marcus Bjurman, who was the one initiating this project in 2001 and developed it up to version 1.1.6 in January 2004.
Later on, since 2004, GNOME Commander was maintained by the new lead developer Piotr Eljasiak, working at the project already since 2002. In this time, Assaf Gordon contributed by implementing the internal file viewer.
Piotr conducted the development until version 1.2.8.15. In this time Magnus Stålnacke was responsible for the homepage. On the mailing list, amongst others, Michael and Magnus contributed with many great ideas and by helping finding bugs and other inconsistencies. After Magnus resigned from the project, Thomas Jost helped to maintain the homepage at Savannah.org
Unfortunately, Piotr suddenly passed away in the beginning of 2012 and GNOME Commander had no maintainer for nearly two years. Late in 2013, Uwe Scholz, a user of GNOME Commander since the days before version 1.0, took over the project as project maintainer.
In the beginning, GNOME Commander had its home at Sourceforge. Later, the project moved to Savannah.org, where it got its own homepage and its mailing lists. In the end of 2003, the source tree moved to Gnome.org. Though, the homepage and mailing lists were still hosted at Savannah.
Since 2013, the location of the GNOME Commander home page has been moved to GitHub.org.
