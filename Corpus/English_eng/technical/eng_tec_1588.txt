Atn function
Atn Function [Run-time]
Trigonometric function that returns the arc tangent of a numerical expression.
The return value is in the range -Pi/2 to +Pi/2.
The arc tangent is the inverse of the tangent function.
The Atn Function returns the angle &quot; Alpha &quot; , expressed in radians, using the tangent of this angle.
The function can also return the angle &quot; Alpha &quot; by comparing the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite of the angle to the length of the side that is adjacent to the angle in a right-angled triangle.
Atn(side opposite the angle/side adjacent to angle) = Alpha
Syntax:
Atn (Number)
Return value:
Double
Parameters:
Number:
A numerical expression that represents the ratio of the length of the opposite side to that of the adjacent side of a right-angled triangle.
The Atn function returns the corresponding angle in radians (arc tangent).
To convert degrees to radians, multiply degrees by Pi/180.
To convert radians to degrees, multiply radians by 180/Pi.
degree=(radian*180)/Pi
radian=(degree*Pi)/180
Pi is here the fixed circle constant with the rounded value 3.1415926...
Example:
REM The following example calculates for a right-angled triangle
REM the angle Alpha from the tangent of the angle Alpha:
Sub ExampleATN
REM rounded Pi = 3.1415926... is a predefined variable
Dim d1 As Double
Dim d2 As Double
d1 = InputBox$ ( &quot; Enter the length of the side adjacent to the angle: &quot; , &quot; Adjacent &quot; )
d2 = InputBox$ ( &quot; Enter the length of the side opposite the angle: &quot; , &quot; Opposite &quot; )
Print &quot; The Alpha angle is &quot; ; (atn (d2/d1) * 180 / Pi); &quot; degrees &quot;
