This functions enable you to get a lot of information about PHP itself, e.g. runtime configuration, loaded extensions, version and much more.
You 'll also find functions to set options for your running PHP.
The probably best known function of PHP - phpinfo() - can be found here.
No external libraries are needed to build this extension.
There is no installation needed to use these functions; they are part of the PHP core.
The behaviour of these functions is affected by settings in php.ini.

Here is a short explanation of the configuration directives.
Enable assert() evaluation.
Terminate script execution on failed assertions.
Issue a PHP warning for each failed assertion.
user function to call on failed assertions
Use the current setting of error_reporting() during assertion expression evaluation.
If enabled, no errors are shown (implicit error_reporting(0)) while evaluation.
If disabled, errors are shown according to the settings of error_reporting()
This directive is really only useful in the Apache module version of PHP.
You can turn dynamic loading of PHP extensions with dl() on and off per virtual server or per directory.
The main reason for turning dynamic loading off is security.
With dynamic loading, it 's possible to ignore all open_basedir restrictions.
The default is to allow dynamic loading, except when using safe_mode.
In safe-mode, it' s always imposible to use dl().
This sets the maximum time in seconds a script is allowed to run before it is terminated by the parser.
This helps prevent poorly written scripts from tying up the server.
The default setting is 30.
The maximum execution time is not affected by system calls, the sleep() function, etc.
Please see the set_time_limit() function for more details.
Sets the magic_quotes state for GPC (Get / Post / Cookie) operations.
When magic_quotes are on, all '(single-quote), "(double quote),\ (backslash) and NUL's are escaped with a backslash automatically.
Note:
If the magic_quotes_sybase directive is also ON it will completely override magic_quotes_gpc.
Having both directives enabled means only single quotes are escaped as' '.
Double quotes, backslashes and NUL 's will remain untouched and unescaped.
See also get_magic_quotes_gpc()
If magic_quotes_runtime is enabled, most functions that return data from any sort of external source including databases and text files will have quotes escaped with a backslash.
If magic_quotes_sybase is also on, a single-quote is escaped with a single-quote instead of a backslash.
This extension has no resource types defined.
The constants below are always available as part of the PHP core.
