PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Lyophilisate and solvent for suspension for injection.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Cats.
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
Active immunisation of cats aged 8 weeks and older:
- against feline viral rhinotracheitis to reduce clinical signs,
- against calicivirus infection to reduce clinical signs and excretion,
- against Chlamydophila felis infection to reduce clinical signs,
- against feline panleucopenia to prevent mortality and clinical signs,
- against leukaemia to prevent persistent viraemia and clinical signs of the related disease.
Onsets of immunity have been demonstrated 1 week after primary vaccination course for rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, Chlamydophila felis and panleucopenia components, and 2 weeks after primary vaccination course for feline leukaemia component.
The duration of immunity is 1 year after the last (re-)vaccination for rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, Chlamydophila felis and feline leukaemia components, and 3 years for panleucopenia component.
4.3 Contraindications
Do not use in pregnant animals.
The use is not recommended during lactation.
4.4 Special warnings
None.
2/ 18 4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Use only in healthy animals.
It is recommended that a test for FeLV antigenaemia be carried out prior to vaccination.
Vaccination of FeLV positive cats is of no benefit.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
This vaccine should not be handled by persons who are immunodeficient or taking immunosuppressive drugs.
If self-injection occurs, immediate medical advice should be sought and the doctor informed that self-injection with a living chlamydial vaccine has occurred.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
In normal conditions of use, transient apathy and anorexia may occasionally occur, as well as hyperthermia (lasting usually for 1or 2 days).
A local reaction may occur (slight pain at palpation, itching or limited oedema) that disappears within 1 or 2 weeks at most.
In exceptional circumstances a hypersensitivity reaction may occur, which may require appropriate symptomatic treatment.
In very rare cases, hyperthermia and lethargy sometimes associated with lameness has been observed one to three weeks following booster vaccination in adult cats.
The reaction was transient.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Do not use in pregnant animals.
The use is not recommended during lactation
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Safety and efficacy data are available which demonstrate that this vaccine can be administered the same day but not mixed with Merial adjuvanted vaccine against rabies.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Inject by subcutaneous route one 1-ml dose of vaccine after reconstitution of the lyophilisate with the solvent, according to the following vaccination scheme:
Primary vaccination course:
- first injection: from 8 weeks of age,
- second injection:
3 to 4 weeks later.
In the presence of high levels of maternally derived specific antibodies, the primary vaccination course should be delayed until 12 weeks of age.
Revaccination:
- for all components one year after the primary vaccination course,
- then every year for the rhinotracheitis, calicivirosis, chlamydiosis and feline leukaemia
components, and every three years for the panleucopenia component.
3/ 18 4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
No effect other than those already mentioned in section “ Adverse Reactions”. have been observed, except hyperthermia that may exceptionally last 5 days.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Not applicable.
5.
IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
ATC Vet code:
QI06AJ05
Vaccine against feline viral rhinotracheitis, feline calicivirosis, chlamydiosis, feline panleucopenia and feline leukaemia.
Stimulates active immunity against feline rhinotracheitis herpesvirus, feline calicivirus, Chlamydophila felis, feline panleucopenia virus and feline leukaemia virus.
The feline leukaemia vaccine strain is a recombinant canarypox virus expressing the env and gag genes of FeLV-A.
Under field conditions, only sub-group A is infective and immunisation against sub-group A provides full protection against A, B and C.
After inoculation, the virus expresses the protective proteins, but does not replicate in the cat.
As a consequence, the vaccine induces an immune status against feline leukaemia virus.
