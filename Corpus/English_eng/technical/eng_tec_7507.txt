Whether we should leave other clients connected
When connecting to a host, the client can say to the server to leave other clients connected or to drop the existent connections. Set the value to true to share the desktop with the other clients.
Whether we should show tabs even when there is only one active connection
Set to "true" to always show the tabs. Set to "false" to only show the tabs when there is more than one active connection.
Whether we should show the menu accelerators (shortcut keys)
Set to "false" to disable menu shortcuts. Set to "true" to enable them. Note that if they are enabled, those keys will be intercepted by the menu and will not be sent to the remote host.
Maximum number of history items in connect dialog
Specifies the maximum number of items in the host dropdown entry.
Whether we should start the program listening for reverse connections
Set to "true" to always start the program listening for reverse connections.
