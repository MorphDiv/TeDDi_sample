notification
& kde;, like all applications, needs to inform the user when a problem occurs, a task is completed, or something has happened. & kde; uses a set of System Notifications to keep the user informed on what is happening.
Using this module, you can determine what & kde; does to communicate each event.
This settings module consists of the two tabs Applications and Player Settings.
Applications
To configure a notification, simply select the application from the drop down box at the top of the dialog labeled Event source:. This will lead to a list of all configurable notifications for the application. The list of notifications includes 6 columns to the left of the notification name. These columns (from left to right) are:
Play a sound
This does exactly what you think it does. If an icon is present in this column, & kde; will play a specific sound over the speakers. This is commonly used by games in & kde; for starting a new game, or other action within the game.
Show a message in a pop up
If an icon is present in this column, & kde; will open a message box and inform the user of the notification. This is probably the most commonly selected option for alerting users to an error.
Log to a file
If an icon is present in this column, & kde; will write certain information to a file on disk for later retrieval. This is useful for tracking problems or important system changes.
Mark taskbar entry
If an icon is present in this column, & kde; will cause the taskbar to flash until the user has clicked the taskbar entry. This is most useful when you want the user to look at the program (such as a new email message was received, or the users name was said on an IRC channel).
Speech
If a mark is in this checkbox, & kde; will cause the taskbar of the program sending the notification to flash until the user has clicked the taskbar entry.
Run command
If an icon is present in this column, a separate program will be executed when this notification is performed. This can be used to execute a program to help restore data, shutdown a potentially compromised system or email another user to alert them to a problem.
Change a notification
To make a change to a notification, click on the name of the notification once with the & LMB;. The notification will be highlighted and the checkboxes for all notification types are enabled.
You can have more than one event triggered by a single notification. As an example, it is easy to have a sound played and a message box appear in response to a system notification. One notification does not prevent other notifications from operating.
The following list details each of the notification types and how to use them.
Play a sound
If a mark is in this checkbox, & kde; will play a sound everytime this notification is initiated. To specify the sound, use the text box to the right of the checkbox to enter the folder location of the sound file you want & kde; to play. You can use the folder button (located to the far right of the dialog box) to browse your directory tree. To hear a test of your sound, simply click on the play button (small button directly to the right of Play a sound.)
Show a message in a pop up
If a mark is in this checkbox, & kde; will open a message box and inform the user of the notification. The text of the box can not be changed from this dialog. If you place a mark in the checkbox labeled Use a passive window that does not interrupt other work, & kde; will open the message box, but it will not change desktops and the message box will not appear until the user returns to the program sending the notification. If that box is left empty, the user must respond to the message box even if it means they have to stop working on another program.
Log to a file
If a mark is in this checkbox, & kde; will write certain information to a file on disk for later retrieval. To specify the log file to use, enter the pathname in the text box to the right of the checkbox. You can use the folder button (located to the far right of the dialog box) to browse your directory tree.
Mark taskbar entry
Run command
If a mark is in this checkbox, a separate program will be executed when this notification is performed. To specify the program to execute, enter the pathname in the text box to the right of the checkbox. You can use the folder button (located to the far right of the dialog box) to browse your directory tree.
If a mark is in this checkbox, & kde; will use KTTS to speak the event message, event name or custom text.
If you select Speak Custom Text, enter the text in the box. You may use the following substitution strings in the text:
%e Name of the event
%a Application that sent the event
%m Message sent by the application
You can use the icon columns (located to the left of the notifications) to quickly select or deselect the options. Clicking in the column with the & LMB; will toggle the notification on and off.
Player Settings
Use the & kde; sound system
If a mark is in this radio button, & kde; will play all sound notifications through the & kde; sound system. You can adjust the volume of system notifications using the slider.
The slider only affects & kde; system notifications. Changes to this slider will not affect other sounds on your computer.
Use external player
If a mark is in this radio button, & kde; will not use the & kde; sound system to play the sound. This is a good choice if the sound format you want to use is not supported by the & kde; notification system. After checking the radio box, enter the full path and name of the program you want to use into the text field. You can use the folder button (located along the right side) to browse the directory tree.
No audio output
Disables all sound notifications.
KControl
The panel consists of a large list of specific events which need to be communicated to the user. This list is organized into groups by applications.
