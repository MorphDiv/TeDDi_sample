Introduction
Gametype:
Board, Arcade
Number of possible players:
One
In & kmahjongg; the tiles are scrambled and stacked on top of each other to resemble a certain shape. The player is then expected to remove all the tiles off the game board by locating each tile's matching pair.
How to play
Objective:
Remove all tiles from the game board by locating each tile's matching pair as fast as possible.
& kappname; will load a default layout automatically once you start the game and you can start playing right away.
Note:
The game timer will start immediately if the game is started.
You should carefully study the stack of tiles laid out on the game board and find two tiles matching exactly. When you have found such a pair use your mouse to select these.
Bear in mind that you can only select the tiles which are Open. Tiles are considered Blocked when they are positioned behind other tiles, and when both the right and left sides of the tile are filled by others. If at least one of the lateral sides is empty then the tile is considered'Open ', and can be removed.
Once you have selected the right pair of tiles they will vanish off the game board, thus revealing the tiles previously located underneath, and opening the tiles adjacent to them.
Find as many matches as possible to remove all the tiles from the game board.
Game Rules, Strategies and Tips

A quick explanation of the parts of the game screen.
Game Screen
The Game screen is in the center of the screen and is the largest section of the window. The background is populated with the game tiles.
Statusbar
The Status bar is located at the bottom of the screen, and contains four panes. The first pane lists the removed/ total tiles and the number of matching tiles that have free sides. The second pane gives the sequence number of the game you are playing. The third pane lets the player know when the game is ready, and the last pane displays the game timer, which keeps track of the elapsed time from the start of the game until the game is finished.

Only the open tiles can be selected.
Open tile is the tile which has one of the tile's lateral sides open, meaning that no other tiles are located immediately next to it.
Only when matching, open tiles can be removed from the game board.
Matching tiles are those where the face pictograms match.
There are exceptions to this rule! In the traditional game of Mahjong each tile has a matching one except for the Flowers and Seasons tiles.
The Flowers tiles have no doubles in the set and can be matched directly to each-other.
The Seasons tiles have no doubles in the set and can be matched directly to each-other.
Not every & kmahjongg; game can be finished. Sometimes the tiles are mixed in such a way that it may not be possible to find all the matches. This problem can be avoided. Please refer to this section of the configuration dialog.
To be eligible for a place amongst the high scores the player has to complete a game instance within the shortest period of time possible.
If the player uses the Hint feature the record will not be considered as a high score.
