About KDiff3 menu plugin...
KDiff3 Menu Plugin: Copyright (C) 2008 Joachim Eibl KDiff3 homepage: http: / /kdiff3. sourceforge. net
Using the context menu extension: For simple comparison of two selected files choose "Compare". If the other file is somewhere else, "Save" the first file for later, and it will appear in the "Compare With..." submenu. Then, use "Compare With" on the second file. For a 3-way merge first, "Save" the base file, then the branch to merge, and then "3-way merge with base" on the other branch which will be used as the destination. The same also applies to directory comparison and merge.
