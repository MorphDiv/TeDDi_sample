(PHP 3, PHP 4)
virtual() is an Apache-specific function which is equivalent to !--#include virtual...- - in mod_include.
It performs an Apache sub-request.
It is useful for including CGI scripts or .shtml files, or anything else that you would parse through Apache.
Note that for a CGI script, the script must generate valid CGI headers.
At the minimum that means it must generate a Content-type header.
For PHP files, you need to use include() or require(); virtual() cannot be used to include a document which is itself a PHP file.
To run the sub-request, all buffers are terminated and flushed to the browser, pending headers are sent too.
