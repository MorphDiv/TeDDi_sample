Introduction
This module is used to configure how the individual widgets are drawn by & kde;.
A Widget is a commonly-used programmer's term for referring to User Interface elements such as buttons, menus, and scroll bars. You can think of them as the fundamental pieces that are assembled to make your application.
You can configure how the widgets are drawn with this module, but to change the color of the widgets, you should refer to the section entitled Colors.
This panel is divided into three tabs: Applications, Workspace and Fine Tuning.
Applications tab
The top drop down box, labeled Widget Style contains a list of the pre-defined styles. Each style has a name, and a brief description.
To change styles, simply click on the style name, and a preview of the style will be displayed in the preview box below the style list.
If a style is configurable, the Configure... button at the right side of the drop down box is enabled and can be used to open a dialog to select further settings.
Workspace tab
A list of available themes is displayed on this tab. Select a theme by clicking on an item in the list.
Use the Get New Themes button to launch the Get Hot New Stuff dialog and download additional themes from the Internet.
Fine Tuning tab
Graphical effects
& kde; applications will run internal animations with the selected display resolution and CPU usage.
Show icons on buttons
If this option is selected, action buttons (like OK and Apply) will have a small icon located within them to act as a visual reference. If this option is not selected, then only text will appear on the button.
Main toolbar text, Secondary toolbar text
These drop down boxes lets you determine where on the button in both toolbars the text name of the button will appear as the default. If No Text is selected, then there is no text on the toolbar buttons. If Text Only is selected, then the button's icon is replaced with a text name of the button. If Text Beside Icons is selected, then the name of the button will be placed to the right of the icon. If Text Below Icons is selected, the default will be to have the text of the button below the icon.
This option only specifies the default location. Each application can override the setting used in this panel.
