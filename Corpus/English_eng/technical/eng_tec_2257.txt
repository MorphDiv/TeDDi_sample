WEEKDAY function
WEEKDAY
Returns the day of the week for the given date value.
The day is returned as an integer in the range 1 (Sunday) to 7 (Saturday) if Type is omitted or Type = 1 is specified.
If Type = 2, numbering begins at Monday = 1; and if Type = 3 numbering begins at Monday = 0.
Syntax:
WEEKDAY(Number; Type)
Number
, as a date value, is a decimal for which the weekday is to be returned.
Type
determines the type of calculation.
For Type = 1, the weekdays are counted starting from Sunday (this is the default if the Type parameter is omitted).
For Type = 2, the weekdays are counted starting from Monday = 1.
For Type = 3, the weekdays are counted starting from Monday = 0.

Examples:
=WEEKDAY( &quot; 14/06/2000 &quot; ) returns 4 (the Type parameter is omitted, therefore the standard count is used.
The standard count starts with Sunday as day number 1.
14th June 2000 was a Wednesday and therefore day number 4).
=WEEKDAY( &quot; 24/07/1996 &quot; ; 2) returns 3 (the Type parameter is 2, therefore Monday is day number 1.
24th July 1996 was a Wednesday and therefore day number 3).
=WEEKDAY( &quot; 24/07/1996 &quot; ; 1) returns 4 (the Type parameter is 1, therefore Sunday is day number 1.
24th July 1996 was a Wednesday and therefore day number 4).
=WEEKDAY(NOW()) returns the number of the current day.
