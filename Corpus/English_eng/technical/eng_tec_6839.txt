Parent Processes and Child Processes
A parent process is a process that spawns another process. The spawned process is a child process of the original parent process. By default,
Process Priority and Nice Values
Processes run in order of priority: high-priority processes run before low-priority processes. Child processes generally inherit their priority from their parent process.
The priority of a process is set by the nice value of the process, as follows:
A nice value of 0 means that the process has normal priority.
The higher the nice value, the lower the priority.
The lower the nice value, the higher the priority.
For information about how to change the priority of a process, see
To Sort the Process List
To sort the process list, perform the following steps:
Select the
By default, the processes are listed by name, in alphabetical order. To list the processes in reverse alphabetical order, click on the
Click on any column header to sort the processes by the information in that column, in alphabetical or numerical order.
Click again on the column header to sort the data in reverse alphabetical or reverse numerical order.
To Modify the Contents of the Process List
You can modify the contents of the process list in several ways.
To Show All Processes

Parent processes are indicated by a triangle symbol to the left of the process name. Click on the triangle symbol to show or hide the associated child processes.
Child processes are indented, and listed with their parent process.
If the
Parent processes and child processes are not distinguishable.
All processes are listed in alphabetical order.
To Display Memory Maps for a Process
To display memory maps for a process, perform the following steps:
Select the process in the process list.
Choose
The
Filename
The location of a shared library that is currently used by the process. If this field is blank, the memory information in this row describes memory that is owned by the process whose name is displayed above the memory-map table.
VM Start
The address at which the memory segment begins.
VM End
The address at which the memory segment ends.
VM Size
The size of the memory segment.
Flags
The following flags describe the different types of memory-segment access that the process can have:
p
The memory segment is private to the process, and is not accessible to other processes.
r
The process has permission to read from the memory segment.
s
The memory segment is shared with other processes.
w
The process has permission to write into the memory segment.
x
The process has permission to execute instructions that are contained within the memory segment.
VM Offset
The virtual memory offset of the memory segment.
Device
The major and minor device numbers of the device on which the shared library filename is located.
Inode
The inode on the device from which the shared library location is loaded into memory.
Click on any column header to sort the data by the information in that column, in alphabetical or numerical order. Click again on the column header to sort the data in reverse alphabetical or reverse numerical order.
Click
To Change the Priority of a Process
To change the priority of a process, perform the following steps:
Select the process for which you want to change the priority.
Choose
Use the slider to set the nice value of the process.
The nice value sets the priority of the process: the lower the nice value, the higher the priority.
To specify a nice value lower than zero, non-root users must enter the root password.
Click on the
