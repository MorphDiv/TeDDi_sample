The Observing List Tool
Observing List Tool
The purpose of the Observing List Tool is to provide convenient access to some common functions for a list of objects chosen by you. Objects are added to the list by using the Add to List action in the popup menu, or by simply pressing the O key to add the currently-selected object.
Objects in the list can be sorted by any of the data columns (Name, Right Ascension, Declination, Magnitude, and Type). To perform an action on an object, highlight it in the list, and then press one of the Action buttons at the top of the window. Some actions can be performed while multiple objects are selected; others only operate when one object is selected. The available actions are:
Center
Center the display on the selected object, and begin Tracking it.
Scope
Point your telescope at the selected object.
Alt vs. Time
Open the Altitude vs. Time Tool, with the selected object(s) preloaded
Details
Open the Detailed Information Window for the selected object.
Remove
Remove the selected object(s) from the observing list.
The Observing List tool is a new feature and is still under development. We are planning to add more features, such as adding objects to the list by selecting a region in the sky, and the ability to save observing lists to disk.
