EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
TYSABRI
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Tysabri?
Tysabri is a concentrate that is made up into a solution for infusion (drip into a vein).
It contains the active substance natalizumab.
What is Tysabri used for?
Tysabri is used to treat adults with multiple sclerosis (MS).
It is used in the type of MS known as ‘ relapsing-remitting’, when the patient has attacks (relapses) followed by periods with no symptoms (remissions).
It is used when the disease is: • highly active despite treatment with a beta-interferon (another type of medicine used in MS), or; • severe and getting worse rapidly.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Tysabri used?
Treatment with Tysabri should be started and supervised by a doctor who is experienced in treating diseases of the nervous system, and who has access to a type of scanning machine called a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine.
This machine will enable the doctor to check for changes in the brain linked to MS or the rare brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).
Tysabri is given as one infusion lasting one hour every four weeks.
Because the infusion can trigger an allergic reaction, the patient must be monitored during and for one hour after the infusion.
If there is no clear benefit for the patient after six months, the doctor will have to re-assess the treatment.
Patients who receive Tysabri must be given a special alert card that summarises the key safety information about the medicine.
Patients should show this card to their partner or carer, as well as to other doctors treating them, because they may notice symptoms of PML that the patient is not aware of, such as changes in mood, behaviour or speech.
How does Tysabri work?
The active substance in Tysabri, natalizumab, is a monoclonal antibody.
A monoclonal antibody is an antibody (a type of protein) that has been designed to recognise and bind to a specific structure (called an antigen) that is found on certain cells in the body.
Natalizumab has been designed to bind to a specific part of an ‘ integrin ’ called ‘ 4 1 integrin’.
This is found on the surface of most leucocytes (the white cells in the blood that are involved in the inflammation process).

MS is a disease of the nerves, in which inflammation destroys the protective sheath surrounding the nerve cells.
By blocking the integrin, natalizumab stops the leucocytes from going from the blood into the brain.
This reduces inflammation, and the nerve damage caused by MS.
How has Tysabri been studied?
The effects of Tysabri were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
Two studies, both lasting two years, have looked at Tysabri in MS.
One study compared Tysabri on its own (monotherapy) with placebo (a dummy treatment) in 942 patients.
The second study looked at the effect of adding Tysabri to interferon beta-1a (another medicine used in MS) in 1,171 patients.
The main measures of effectiveness were the number of relapses, and the changes in the patients’ level of disability, measured using a standard scale (the Expanded Disability Status Scale).
What benefit has Tysabri shown during the studies?
In the monotherapy study, Tysabri was more effective than placebo in reducing the number of relapses.
After one year, there was a decrease of about two-thirds in the number of MS attacks in Tysabri-treated patients, in comparison with the patients who received placebo.
Tysabri was also more effective than placebo on the disabling effects of MS: over two years, the risk of disability getting worse was reduced by 42% in comparison with placebo.
In the add-on study with interferon beta-1a, the risk of disability getting worse and the number of relapses were reduced.
However, the way the study was designed did not allow the clear identification of whether these results were due to Tysabri only, or to the combination.
What is the risk associated with Tysabri?
Patients, carers and doctors need to be aware that Tysabri can be associated with infections, including PML.
PML has symptoms that are similar to those of an MS attack, and usually leads to severe disability or death.
If PML is suspected, the doctor must stop treatment until it is certain that the patient does not have the infection.
In the studies, the most common side effects with Tysabri (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) were urinary tract infection (infections of the structures that carry urine), nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat), urticaria (rash), headache, dizziness, vomiting, nausea (feeling sick), arthralgia (joint pain), rigors (shaking chills), pyrexia (fever) and fatigue (tiredness).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Tysabri, see the Package Leaflet.
About 6% of the patients in the studies developed long-lasting antibodies against natalizumab.
This led to a decrease in the effectiveness of the medicine.
Tysabri should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to natalizumab or any of the other ingredients.
It must not be given to patients who have PML or who are at risk of getting an infection, including patients whose immune systems are weakened because of disease or other medicines they are receiving or may have received before.
Tysabri must not be given with beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate (other long-term medicines for MS).
It also must not be given to patients who have cancer (unless it is a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma) or to people under 18 years of age.
For the full list of restrictions, see the Package Leaflet.
Why has Tysabri been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the effectiveness of Tysabri in MS, on both relapses and disability, had been clearly shown.
However, because of its safety profile, the medicine should only be used in patients who have a real need for the medicine.
The Committee decided that Tysabri’ s benefits are greater than its risks as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting MS for patients with high disease activity despite treatment with a beta-interferon, or with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting MS.
The Committee recommended that Tysabri be given marketing authorisation.
Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Tysabri?
The company that makes Tysabri will ensure that all doctors who prescribe Tysabri are supplied with an educational pack that gives them all the information they need to ensure that the medicine is used appropriately, and that the patients are closely monitored.
