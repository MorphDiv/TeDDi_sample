(PHP 3 = 3.0.9, PHP 4)
The cpdf_place_inline_image() function places an image created with the php image functions on the page at position (x-coor, y-coor).
The image can be scaled at the same time.
The optional parameter mode determines the unit length.
If it 's 0 or omitted the default unit as specified for the page is used.
Otherwise the coordinates are measured in postscript points disregarding the current unit.
See also cpdf_import_jpeg().
