Gravity Checking this makes the game even harder: If a tile is removed, all tiles lying above it will fall down one step.
Allow unsolvable games If checked, you run the risk of being presented with games that are impossible to solve. Note: Even if not checked, you will fail to complete a game if you remove the tiles in the wrong order!
Allow unsolvable games
Use Chinese style: any flower match any flower, any season match any season Use the traditional rules for matching the tiles. Previous version of the game used to allow only exact tiles matches, which is inconsistent with Mah-jongg rules. It is recommended to keep this option checked.

Tiles can slide, but you can connect only in 2 lines instead of 3 This option changes the rules to the point where it almost becomes a completely different game. When it is active, you can only remove the tiles if they can be connected by a line consisting of only two segments instead of the customary three. However, you are allowed to slide the tiles on the board, if the row or column where they are placed has some empty space. To make a sliding move, you have to click on the tile containing the column or row that can slide, and then on the matching tile. If there are two possible sliding moves, you will have to click on one of the two connecting lines to choose your preferred move.
