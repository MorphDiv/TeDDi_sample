(PHP 4 = 4.0.1)
array_intersect() returns an array containing all the values of array1 that are present in all the arguments.
Note that keys are preserved.
Example 1. array_intersect() example
$array1 = array ("a "= "green", "red", "blue"); $array2 = array ("b" = "green", "yellow", "red"); $result = array_intersect ($array1, $array2);
This makes $result have
Array ([a] = green [0] = red)
Note:
Two elements are considered equal if and only if (string) $elem1 === (string) $elem2.
In words: when the string representation is the same.
Warning
This was broken in PHP 4.0.4!
