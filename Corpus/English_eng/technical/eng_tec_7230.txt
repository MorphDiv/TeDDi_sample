Getting default parameters
This pre-calibrates the screen by sending colored and gray patches to your screen and measuring them with the hardware device.
Reading the patches
Reading the patches using the color measuring instrument.
Drawing the patches
Drawing the generated patches to the screen, which will then be measured by the hardware device.

Wait for the ink to dry
Please wait a few minutes for the ink to dry. Profiling damp ink will produce a poor profile and may damage your color measuring instrument.

Place the colorimeter on the area of white next to the letter and click and hold the measure switch.
Slowly scan the target line from left to right and release the switch when you get to the end of the page.
Ensure the center of the device is properly aligned with the row you are trying to measure.

Calibration checklist
Before calibrating the display, it is recommended to configure your display with the following settings to get optimal results.
You may want to consult the owner's manual for your display on how to achieve these settings.
Reset your display to the factory defaults.
Disable dynamic contrast if your display has this feature.
Configure your display with custom color settings and ensure the RGB channels are set to the same values.
If custom color is not available then use a 6500K color temperature.
Adjust the display brightness to a comfortable level for prolonged viewing.
For best results, the display should have been powered for at least 15 minutes before starting the calibration.
Check Settings
Calibration and profiling software is not installed.
These tools are required to build color profiles for devices.

Before profiling the device, you have to manually capture an image of a calibration target and save it as a TIFF image file.
Ensure that the contrast and brightness are not changed and color correction profiles have not been applied.
The device sensor should have been cleaned prior to scanning and the output file resolution should be at least 200dpi.
Ensure that the white-balance has not been modified by the camera and that the lens is clean.
Please select the calibration target type.

Choose profiling mode
Please indicate if you want to profile a local printer, generate some test patches, or profile using existing test patches.
Calibration Mode
Choose calibration quality
Higher quality calibration requires many color samples and more time.
A higher precision profile provides higher accuracy in color matching but requires more time for reading the color patches.
For a typical workflow, a normal precision profile is sufficient.
The high precision profile also requires more paper and printer ink.
