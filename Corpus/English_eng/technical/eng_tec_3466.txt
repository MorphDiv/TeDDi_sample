Warning
This function is EXPERIMENTAL.
The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP.
Use this function at your own risk.
ingres_rollback() rolls back the currently open transaction, actually canceling all changes made to the database during the transaction.
This closes the transaction.
A new one can be open by sending a query with ingres_query().
See also ingres_query(), ingres_commit(), and ingres_autocommit().
