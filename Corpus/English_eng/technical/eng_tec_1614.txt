Unary/Binary Operators
You can choose various unary and binary operators to build your $[officename] Math formula.
Unary refers to operators that affect one placeholder.
Binary refers to operators that connect two placeholders.
The lower area of the Formula Elements window displays the individual operators.
The
context menu
of the
Commands
window also contains a list of these operators, as well as additional operators.
If you need an operator that is not contained in the Formula Elements window, use the context menu or type it directly in the
Commands
window.
View - Formula Elements
) or through the context menu of the Commands window.

uoper
in the
Commands
window, followed by the syntax for the character.
This function is useful for incorporating special characters into a formula.
For example, the command
uoper %theta x
produces a small Greek letter theta (a component of the
$[officename] Math
character set).
You can also insert characters not in the $[officename] character set by choosing
Tools - Symbols - Catalogue - Edit
.
boper
into the
Commands
window.
For example, the command
y boper %theta x
produces the small Greek letter theta preceded by a
y
and followed by an
x
.
You can also insert characters not in the $[officename] character set by choosing
Tools - Symbols - Catalogue - Edit
.
< ? > oplus < ? >
in the
Commands
window, you insert a
circled plus operator
in your document.
< ? > ominus < ? >
in the
Commands
window to insert a
circled minus operator
.
< ? > odot < ? >
in the
Commands
window to insert a
circled dot operator
in the formula.
< ? > odivide < ? >
in the
Commands
window to insert a
circled division operator
in the formula.
a wideslash b
in the
Commands
window to produce two characters with a slash (from lower left to upper right) between them.
The characters are set such that everything to the left of the slash is up, and everything to the right is down.
This command is also available in the context menu of the
Commands
window.
a widebslash b
in the
Commands
window to produce two characters with a slash (from upper left to lower right) between them.
The characters are set such that everything to the left of the slash is down, and everything to the right is up.
This command is also available in the context menu of the
Commands
window.
sub
or
sup
in the Commands window to add indices and powers to the characters in your formula; for example, a sub 2.
Tools - Symbols - Catalogue
or click the
Catalogue
icon on the Tools bar.
Click the
Edit
button in the dialogue box that appears, then select the
Special
symbol set.
Enter a meaningful name next to
Symbol
, for example, &quot; divide &quot; and then click the colon in the set of symbols.
Click
Add
and then
OK
.
Then click
OK
to close the
Symbols
dialogue box.
Now you can use the new symbol, in this case the colon, by entering its name in the Commands window, for example,
a %divide b = c
.
When entering information manually in the Commands window, please note that a number of operators require spaces between the elements for the correct structure.
This is especially true if you are using values instead of placeholders in your operators, for example, to construct a division 4 div 3 or a div b.
