(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns the time the file was last modified, or FALSE in case of an error.
The time is returned as a Unix timestamp, which is suitable for the date() function.
The results of this function are cached.
See clearstatcache() for more details.
This function will not work on remote files; the file to be examined must be accessible via the server's filesystem.
Note:
This function returns the time when the data blocks of a file were being written to, that is, the time when the content of the file was changed.
Example 1. filemtime() example
?php / / outputs e.g. somefile.txt was last modified:
December 29 2002 22:16:23. $filename = 'somefile.txt'; if (file_exists($filename)) {echo "$filename was last modified: ". date ("F d Y H:i:s .", filemtime($filename));}?
See also filectime(), stat(), touch(), and getlastmod().
