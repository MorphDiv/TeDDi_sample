Onset of immunity:
2 weeks
Duration of immunity:

2/ 19 4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Vaccinate only healthy animals.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
To the user:
This product contains mineral oil.
Accidental injection/ self injection may result in severe pain and swelling, particularly if injected into a joint or finger, and, in rare cases, could result in the loss of the affected finger if prompt medical attention is not given.
If you are accidentally injected with this product, seek prompt medical advice even if only a very small amount is injected and take the package insert with you.
If pain persists for more than 12 hours after medical examination, seek medical advice again.
To the physician:
This product contains mineral oil.
Even if small amounts have been injected, accidental injection with this product can cause intense swelling, which may, for example, result in ischaemic necrosis and even the loss of a digit.
Expert, PROMPT, surgical attention is required and may necessitate early incision and irrigation of the injected area, especially where there is involvement of finger pulp or tendon.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Transient local reactions at the injection site may occur after vaccination mainly in the form of a hard, warm and sometimes painful swelling (diameter up to 10 cm).
These reactions resolve spontaneously over a period of approximately 14-21 days without any major consequence on the general health status of the animals.
Immediate systemic hypersensitivity-like reactions may occur after vaccination, resulting in minor neurological symptoms such as tremors and/ or excitation, which normally resolve within minutes without requiring treatment.
A transient increase in body temperature, normally not exceeding 1°C, may occur until 2 days after vaccination.
Occasionally, an increase of rectal temperature up to 2.5 °C lasting less than 24 hours may occur.
Some piglets may be depressed and show a reduced feed intake for up to 5 days.
Vaccination may result in a transient impairment of growth rate in the immediate period after administration of the vaccine.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Do not use during pregnancy and lactation.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No information is available on the safety and efficacy of this vaccine when used with any other veterinary medicinal product.
A decision to use this vaccine before or after any other veterinary medicinal product therefore needs to be decided on a case by case basis.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Before using the vaccine, allow it to reach room temperature and shake well before use.
Avoid multiple vial broaching.
Use sterile syringes and needles.
Avoid introduction of contamination.
Avoid use of vaccination equipment with rubber parts.
