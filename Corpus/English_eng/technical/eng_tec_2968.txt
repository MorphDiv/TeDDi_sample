ftp_nb_fget() retrieves remote_file from the FTP server, and writes it to the given file pointer, fp.
The transfer mode specified must be either FTP_ASCII or FTP_BINARY.
The difference between this function and the ftp_fget() is that this function retrieves the file asynchronously, so your program can perform other operations while the file is being downloaded.
Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
See also ftp_nb_get().
