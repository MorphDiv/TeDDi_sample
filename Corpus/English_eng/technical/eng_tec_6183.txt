Ripping speed has been extremely slow for the last 5 minutes. To preserve extraction quality, audex is configured to never skip any detected errors. As such, if your disc is really broken, extracting might never finish. In some cases, only this drive cannot rip audio data from the disc, so perhaps try another one. Do you want to continue extraction?

Album Example:
Sampler Example:
This tag will be replaced with artist of the whole CD. If your CD is a compilation, then this tag represents the title in most cases.
Album Artist
This tag will be replaced with the title of the whole CD. If your CD is a compilation, then this tag represents the subtitle in most cases.
Album Title
This tag will be replaced with the artist of the individual track. It is especially useful on compilation CDs.
Track Artist
This tag will be replaced with the track title. Normally each track on a CD has its own title.
Track Title
This tag will be replaced with the track number of the individual track. This tag has two properties: length defines how many digits the number should at least consist of (Default: 2). fillchar sets the character used to fill the free spaces in front of the number, if it has fewer digits than length. (Default: 0).
Track #
This tag will be replaced with the CD number of a multi-CD album. Often compilations consist of several CDs. This tag has two properties: length defines how many digits the number should at least consist of (Default: 2). fillchar sets the char taken to fill the free spaces in front of the number, if it has fewer digits than length. (Default: 0). Note: This tag will only be replaced if the multi-CD flag is enabled for the CD.
CD #
This tag will be replaced with the release date of the CD. In almost all cases this is the year.
Date
This tag will be replaced with the genre.
Genre
This tag will be replaced with the temporary filename of the cover, e. g. to insert the cover in the id3 v2.3 tag with LAME. The cover file will be created automatically by Audex. This tag has six properties: format defines the image format. Possible values are "PNG", "JPG" and "GIF" (Default: "JPG"). x (width) and y (height) can be used to resize the cover image. If these are not set, then size of the cover image will not be changed. usenocover if this is set to true then the image which is shown if no cover for the current album is set will be used. (Default: false.) preparam and postparam define parameters inserted before (pre) or behind (post) the filename of the temporary cover. These values are only shown if a cover set, or "usenocover" is set to "true". Examples: ${cover format="JPG "x="300" y="300 "preparam="-ti"} A filename of an JPG image with the size of 300x300 will be inserted. If no cover is set, this variable will be replaced by nothing, otherwise something like / tmp/ cover.123. jpg will be inserted. Note: LAME discards cover files larger than 128 KiB. Please bear this in mind, if you set the format and size.
Cover File
This will be replaced with a temporary WAV file created by Audex from CD audio track. You can use it as a normal input file for your command line encoder.
Input File
This tag will be replaced with the full output filename and path. Use it as the output for your command line encoder.

Quality/ Bitrate
This preset should provide near transparency to most people on most music.
Medium (140... 185 kbit/ s)
If you have extremely good hearing and similar equipment, this preset will generally provide slightly higher quality than the "standard" mode
Extreme (220... 260 kbits/ s)
This preset should generally be transparent to most people on most music and is already quite high in quality.
Standard (170... 210 kbit/ s)
This preset will usually be overkill for most people and most situations, but if you must have the absolute highest quality with no regard to filesize, this is the way to go.
