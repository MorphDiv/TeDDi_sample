LOCATION... - concatenate LOCATIONS to standard output.
Concatenate files at locations and print to the standard output. Works just like the traditional cat utility, but using gvfs location instead local files: for example you can use something like smb://server/resource/file.txt as location to concatenate.
Note: just pipe through cat if you need its formatting option like -n, -T or other.
