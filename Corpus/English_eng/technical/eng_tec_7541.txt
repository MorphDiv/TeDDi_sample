EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
AIVLOSIN
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report.
Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) on the basis of the documentation provided, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian.
If you need more information about your animal’ s medical condition or treatment, contact your veterinarian.
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Aivlosin?
Aivlosin is available as a premix for medicated feeding stuff and as an oral powder for pigs, and as granules for use in drinking water for chickens.
The premix is mixed into pig feed by an authorised feed mill and the resulting “ medicated feeding stuff” is then distributed to the farmer to treat a large number of pigs.
The oral powder is mixed into pig feed by the pig owner and is used to treat individual pigs.
The granules are added to the drinking water system, either directly or after dilution into a stock solution.
What is Aivlosin used for?
Aivlosin is an antibiotic.
In pigs, it is used to treat or prevent a number of infectious diseases that are caused by bacteria and affect the lungs (i. e.
Swine Enzootic Pneumonia) or the intestinal tract (Swine Dysentery or Porcine Proliferative Enteropathy).
Aivlosin improves the health and weight of the animals, but may not eliminate completely the bacteria that caused lung infection.
In chickens, it is used to treat or prevent lung infections caused by a bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum.
How does Aivlosin work?
The active substance of Aivlosin is tylvalosin (previous name: acetylisovaleryltylosin), an antibiotic of the macrolide group.
It works by blocking the bacteria's ribosomes, the parts of the cell where proteins are produced, and inhibits the growth of bacteria.

How has Aivlosin been studied?
The antimicrobial effectiveness of tylvalosin against bacteria causing diseases was investigated in microbiological laboratories.
The main clinical studies of the effectiveness of Aivlosin were carried out on farms in a number of countries in Europe as well as outside the EU.
The studies in pigs were carried out either in pigs already affected by the disease or in pigs who had been in contact with diseased animals on the same farm and, therefore, likely to develop the disease as well.
For the treatment of large numbers of pigs, Aivlosin was mixed into pig food by an authorised feed mill using the “ premix for medicated feeding stuff”.
In order to achieve a good mixture in this large volume of food, special mixing equipment is needed and the mixing is done in several steps.
For the treatment of individual pigs or a small number of animals, the animal owner mixed the medicine into the pig feed.
In chicken, Aivlosin was used either to treat already diseased chicken or to help preventing an outbreak of the disease in very young chicks that hatched from eggs, which came from flocks where the disease is present.
The medicine was given with the drinking water at a dosage of 25 for three consecutive days.
In order to prevent an outbreak of the disease, chicks were treated in their first 3 days of life and treatment was repeated after about 2 weeks.
During treatment, the birds did not receive any other water than the medicated drinking water.
What benefit has Aivlosin shown during the studies?
The studies showed that pigs treated with Aivlosin lost less weight during the infection and showed less severe signs of disease than untreated animals.
The treatment success with Aivlosin was similar to the effectiveness of other medicines of the same class authorised for such diseases in pigs.
Chicken treated with Aivlosin showed less severe signs of disease than untreated animals.
The effectiveness of Aivlosin was similar to that of other medicine of the same class already authorised for this disease in chicken.
The treatment did not completely eliminate all bacteria in the respiratory system and some birds still showed the disease; however, the number of affected animals was significantly smaller than in an untreated group of birds.
What is the risk associated with Aivlosin?
Very ill pigs might not eat all the feed offered and therefore might get an insufficient amount of the medicine.
Therefore, treatment via feed with Aivlosin is not recommended for these animals.
Since the composition of the pig feed might affect the effectiveness of Aivlosin, it should only be used in dry feed.
The oral powder cannot properly be mixed into pellets and should therefore not be used in pelleted pig feed.
The medicated drinking water should be replaced every 24 hours.
©EMEA 2008 2/ 3 What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal?
Aivlosin might cause skin reactions in some people.
People who had in the past skin reactions when handling Aivlosin or similar products, should avoid any contact with Aivlosin.
When mixing Aivlosin into feed or drinking water or handling the medicated feed or water, direct contact with eyes, skin and mouth should be avoided and protective equipment should be worn, e. g. overalls, gloves and face masks (respirator).
Skin that has been in contact with Aivlosin or medicated feed or drinking water should be washed.
Aivlosin should not be used in people.
However, if Aivlosin is accidentally consumed by a person, the advice of a doctor should be sought immediately.
What is the time to allow before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption (withdrawal period)?
After the last administration of Aivlosin (in the feed or via drinking water), pigs or chickens should not be slaughtered for two days.
Aivlosin should not be used in hens that lay eggs for human consumption.
It should, therefore, not be used in laying hens or in the two weeks before hens are likely to start laying eggs for human consumption.
Why has Aivlosin been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) concluded that the benefits of Aivlosin are greater than any risks when Aivlosin is mixed into animal feed or drinking water and then used as described in the package leaflet.
The Committee recommended that Aivlosin should be given a marketing authorisation.
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR.
Other information about Aivlosin:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for Aivlosin on 9 September 2004.
Information on the prescription status of this product may be found on the label/ outer package.
