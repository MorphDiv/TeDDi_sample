Server name (ServerName) The hostname of your server, as advertised to the world. By default CUPS will use the hostname of the system. To set the default server used by clients, see the client. conf file. ex: myhost. domain. com
Server administrator (ServerAdmin) The email address to send all complaints or problems to. By default CUPS will use "root@hostname". ex: root@myhost. com
Access log (AccessLog) The access log file; if this does not start with a leading / then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot. By default set to "/ var/ log/ cups/ access_log". You can also use the special name syslog to send the output to the syslog file or daemon. ex: / var/ log/ cups/ access_log
Data directory (DataDir) The root directory for the CUPS data files. By default / usr/ share/ cups. ex: / usr/ share/ cups
Default character set (DefaultCharset) The default character set to use. If not specified, defaults to utf-8. Note that this can also be overridden in HTML documents... ex: utf-8
Default language (DefaultLanguage) The default language if not specified by the browser. If not specified, the current locale is used. ex: en
Document directory (DocumentRoot) The root directory for HTTP documents that are served. By default the compiled-in directory. ex: / usr/ share/ cups/ doc
Error log (ErrorLog) The error log file; if this does not start with a leading / then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot. By default set to "/ var/ log/ cups/ error_log". You can also use the special name syslog to send the output to the syslog file or daemon. ex: / var/ log/ cups/ error_log
Font path (FontPath) The path to locate all font files (currently only for pstoraster). By default / usr/ share/ cups/ fonts. ex: / usr/ share/ cups/ fonts
Log level (LogLevel) Controls the number of messages logged to the ErrorLog file and can be one of the following: debug2: Log everything. debug: Log almost everything. info: Log all requests and state changes. warn: Log errors and warnings. error: Log only errors. none: Log nothing. ex: info
Max log size (MaxLogSize) Controls the maximum size of each log file before they are rotated. Defaults to 1048576 (1MB). Set to 0 to disable log rotating. ex: 1048576
Page log (PageLog) The page log file; if this does not start with a leading / then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot. By default set to "/ var/ log/ cups/ page_log". You can also use the special name syslog to send the output to the syslog file or daemon. ex: / var/ log/ cups/ page_log
Preserve job history (PreserveJobHistory) Whether or not to preserve the job history after a job is completed, canceled, or stopped. Default is Yes. ex: Yes
Preserve job files (PreserveJobFiles) Whether or not to preserve the job files after a job is completed, canceled, or stopped. Default is No. ex: No
Printcap file (Printcap) The name of the printcap file. Default is no filename. Leave blank to disable printcap file generation. ex: / etc/ printcap
Request directory (RequestRoot) The directory where request files are stored. By default / var/ spool/ cups. ex: / var/ spool/ cups
Remote root user (RemoteRoot) The name of the user assigned to unauthenticated accesses from remote systems. By default "remroot". ex: remroot
Server binaries (ServerBin) The root directory for the scheduler executables. By default / usr/ lib/ cups or / usr/ lib32/ cups (IRIX 6.5). ex: / usr/ lib/ cups
Server files (ServerRoot) The root directory for the scheduler. By default / etc/ cups. ex: / etc/ cups
User (User) The user the server runs under. Normally this must be lp, however you can configure things for another user as needed. Note: the server must be run initially as root to support the default IPP port of 631. It changes users whenever an external program is run... ex: lp
Group (Group) The group the server runs under. Normally this must be sys, however you can configure things for another group as needed. ex: sys
RIP cache (RIPCache) The amount of memory that each RIP should use to cache bitmaps. The value can be any real number followed by "k" for kilobytes, "m" for megabytes, "g" for gigabytes, or "t" for tiles (1 tile = 256x256 pixels). Defaults to "8m" (8 megabytes). ex: 8m
Temporary files (TempDir) The directory to put temporary files in. This directory must be writable by the user defined above! Defaults to "/ var/ spool/ cups/ tmp" or the value of the TMPDIR environment variable. ex: / var/ spool/ cups/ tmp
Filter limit (FilterLimit) Sets the maximum cost of all job filters that can be run at the same time. A limit of 0 means no limit. A typical job may need a filter limit of at least 200; limits less than the minimum required by a job force a single job to be printed at any time. The default limit is 0 (unlimited). ex: 200
Listen to (Port/ Listen) Ports/ addresses that are listened to. The default port 631 is reserved for the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) and is what is used here. You can have multiple Port/ Listen lines to listen to more than one port or address, or to restrict access. Note: Unfortunately, most web browsers do n't support TLS or HTTP Upgrades for encryption. If you want to support web-based encryption you will probably need to listen on port 443 (the "HTTPS" port...). ex: 631, myhost:80, 1.2.3.4:631
Hostname lookups (HostNameLookups) Whether or not to do lookups on IP addresses to get a fully-qualified hostname. This defaults to Off for performance reasons... ex: On
Keep alive (KeepAlive) Whether or not to support the Keep-Alive connection option. Default is on. ex: On
Keep-alive timeout (KeepAliveTimeout) The timeout (in seconds) before Keep-Alive connections are automatically closed. Default is 60 seconds. ex: 60
Max clients (MaxClients) Controls the maximum number of simultaneous clients that will be handled. Defaults to 100. ex: 100
Max request size (MaxRequestSize) Controls the maximum size of HTTP requests and print files. Set to 0 to disable this feature (defaults to 0). ex: 0
Client timeout (Timeout) The timeout (in seconds) before requests time out. Default is 300 seconds. ex: 300
Use browsing (Browsing) Whether or not to listen to printer information from other CUPS servers. Enabled by default. Note: to enable the sending of browsing information from this CUPS server to the LAN, specify a valid BrowseAddress. ex: On
Use short names (BrowseShortNames) Whether or not to use "short" names for remote printers when possible (e. g. "printer" instead of "printer@host"). Enabled by default. ex: Yes
Browse addresses (BrowseAddress) Specifies a broadcast address to be used. By default browsing information is broadcast to all active interfaces. Note: HP-UX 10.20 and earlier do not properly handle broadcast unless you have a Class A, B, C, or D netmask (i. e. no CIDR support). ex: x. y. z.255, x. y.255.255
Browse allow/ deny (BrowseAllow/ BrowseDeny) BrowseAllow: specifies an address mask to allow for incoming browser packets. The default is to allow packets from all addresses. BrowseDeny: specifies an address mask to deny for incoming browser packets. The default is to deny packets from no addresses. Both "BrowseAllow" and "BrowseDeny" accept the following notations for addresses: All None *. domain. com. domain. com host. domain. com nnn. * nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mm nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm The hostname/ domainname restrictions only work if you have turned hostname lookups on!
Browse interval (BrowseInterval) The time between browsing updates in seconds. Default is 30 seconds. Note that browsing information is sent whenever a printer's state changes as well, so this represents the maximum time between updates. Set this to 0 to disable outgoing broadcasts so your local printers are not advertised but you can still see printers on other hosts. ex: 30
Browse order (BrowseOrder) Specifies the order of BrowseAllow/ BrowseDeny comparisons. ex: allow, deny
Browse poll (BrowsePoll) Poll the named server(s) for printers. ex: myhost:631
Browse port (BrowsePort) The port used for UDP broadcasts. By default this is the IPP port; if you change this you need to do it on all servers. Only one BrowsePort is recognized. ex: 631
Browse relay (BrowseRelay) Relay browser packets from one address/ network to another. ex: src-address dest-address
Browse timeout (BrowseTimeout) The timeout (in seconds) for network printers - if we do n't get an update within this time the printer will be removed from the printer list. This number definitely should not be less the BrowseInterval value for obvious reasons. Defaults to 300 seconds. ex: 300
Implicit classes (ImplicitClasses) Whether or not to use implicit classes. Printer classes can be specified explicitly in the classes. conf file, implicitly based upon the printers available on the LAN, or both. When ImplicitClasses is On, printers on the LAN with the same name (e. g. Acme-LaserPrint-1000) will be put into a class with the same name. This allows you to setup multiple redundant queues on a LAN without a lot of administrative difficulties. If a user sends a job to Acme-LaserPrint-1000, the job will go to the first available queue. Enabled by default.
System group (SystemGroup) The group name for "System" (printer administration) access. The default varies depending on the operating system, but will be sys, system, or root (checked for in that order). ex: sys
Encryption certificate (ServerCertificate) The file to read containing the server's certificate. Defaults to "/ etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. crt". ex: / etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. crt
Encryption key (ServerKey) The file to read containing the server's key. Defaults to "/ etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. key". ex: / etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. key
Access permissions # Access permissions for each directory served by the scheduler. Locations are relative to DocumentRoot... # AuthType: the authorization to use: # None - Perform no authentication Basic - Perform authentication using the HTTP Basic method. Digest - Perform authentication using the HTTP Digest method. # (Note: local certificate authentication can be substituted by the client for Basic or Digest when connecting to the localhost interface) # AuthClass: the authorization class; currently only Anonymous, User, System (valid user belonging to group SystemGroup), and Group (valid user belonging to the specified group) are supported. # AuthGroupName: the group name for "Group" authorization. # Order: the order of Allow/ Deny processing. # Allow: allows access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or network. # Deny: denies access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or network. # Both "Allow" and "Deny" accept the following notations for addresses: # All None *. domain. com. domain. com host. domain. com nnn. * nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mm nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm # The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups with "HostNameLookups On" above. # Encryption: whether or not to use encryption; this depends on having the OpenSSL library linked into the CUPS library and scheduler. # Possible values: # Always - Always use encryption (SSL) Never - Never use encryption Required - Use TLS encryption upgrade IfRequested - Use encryption if the server requests it # The default value is "IfRequested".
Authentication (AuthType) The authorization to use: None - Perform no authentication. Basic - Perform authentication using the HTTP Basic method. Digest - Perform authentication using the HTTP Digest method. Note: local certificate authentication can be substituted by the client for Basic or Digest when connecting to the localhost interface.
Class (AuthClass) The authorization class; currently only Anonymous, User, System (valid user belonging to group SystemGroup), and Group (valid user belonging to the specified group) are supported.
The user/ group names allowed to access the resource. The format is a comma separated list.
Satisfy (Satisfy) This directive controls whether all specified conditions must be satisfied to allow access to the resource. If set to "all", then all authentication and access control conditions must be satisfied to allow access. Setting Satisfy to "any" allows a user to gain access if the authentication or access control requirements are satisfied. For example, you might require authentication for remote access, but allow local access without authentication. The default is "all".
Authentication group name (AuthGroupName) The group name for Group authorization.
ACL order (Order) The order of Allow/ Deny processing.
Allow Allows access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or network. Possible values are: All None *. domain. com. domain. com host. domain. com nnn. * nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mm nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups with "HostNameLookups On" above.
ACL addresses (Allow/ Deny) Allows/ Denies access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or network. Possible values are: All None *. domain. com. domain. com host. domain. com nnn. * nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mm nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups with "HostNameLookups On" above.
Encryption (Encryption) Whether or not to use encryption; this depends on having the OpenSSL library linked into the CUPS library and scheduler. Possible values: Always - Always use encryption (SSL) Never - Never use encryption Required - Use TLS encryption upgrade IfRequested - Use encryption if the server requests it The default value is "IfRequested".
Access permissions Access permissions for each directory served by the scheduler. Locations are relative to DocumentRoot...
Auto purge jobs (AutoPurgeJobs) Automatically purge jobs when not needed for quotas. Default is No.
Browse protocols (BrowseProtocols) Which protocols to use for browsing. Can be any of the following separated by whitespace and/ or commas: all - Use all supported protocols. cups - Use the CUPS browse protocol. slp - Use the SLPv2 protocol. The default is cups. Note: If you choose to use SLPv2, it is strongly recommended that you have at least one SLP Directory Agent (DA) on your network. Otherwise, browse updates can take several seconds, during which the scheduler will not response to client requests.
Classification (Classification) The classification level of the server. If set, this classification is displayed on all pages, and raw printing is disabled. The default is the empty string. ex: confidential
Allow overrides (ClassifyOverride) Whether to allow users to override the classification on printouts. If enabled, users can limit banner pages to before or after the job, and can change the classification of a job, but cannot completely eliminate the classification or banners. The default is off.
Hide implicit members (HideImplicitMembers) Whether or not to show the members of an implicit class. When HideImplicitMembers is On, any remote printers that are part of an implicit class are hidden from the user, who will then only see a single queue even though many queues will be supporting the implicit class. Enabled by default.
Use & quot; anyquot; classes (ImplicitAnyClasses) Whether or not to create AnyPrinter implicit classes. When ImplicitAnyClasses is On and a local queue of the same name exists, e. g. "printer", "printer@server1", "printer@server1", then an implicit class called "Anyprinter" is created instead. When ImplicitAnyClasses is Off, implicit classes are not created when there is a local queue of the same name. Disabled by default.
Max jobs (MaxJobs) Maximum number of jobs to keep in memory (active and completed). Default is 0 (no limit).
Max jobs per user (MaxJobsPerUser) The MaxJobsPerUser directive controls the maximum number of active jobs that are allowed for each user. Once a user reaches the limit, new jobs will be rejected until one of the active jobs is completed, stopped, aborted, or canceled. Setting the maximum to 0 disables this functionality. Default is 0 (no limit).
Max jobs per printer (MaxJobsPerPrinter) The MaxJobsPerPrinter directive controls the maximum number of active jobs that are allowed for each printer or class. Once a printer or class reaches the limit, new jobs will be rejected until one of the active jobs is completed, stopped, aborted, or canceled. Setting the maximum to 0 disables this functionality. Default is 0 (no limit).
Port The port value that the CUPS daemon is listening to. Default is 631.
Address The address that the CUPS daemon is listening at. Leave it empty or use an asterisk (*) to specify a port value on the entire subnetwork.
Check this box if you want to use SSL encryption with this address/ port.
