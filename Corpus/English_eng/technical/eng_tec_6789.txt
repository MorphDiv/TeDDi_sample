Introduction
appname;
& appname; is a program for managing collections. It began as a simple book collection manager, and has expanded to include default collection templates for bibliographies, comic books, videos, music, coins, stamps, trading cards, video games, wines, board games, and file listings. In addition, custom collections can be built for any other type of collectibles.
What & appname; Is
& appname; keeps track of the items in a collection, and offers an easy way to enter data for each entry. It provides several field types, and allows for an unlimited number of user-defined fields. The entries in a collection may be grouped by any field for easy organization, and customizable views show as much or as little information as you like.
Loans may be tracked, with optional integration with & korganizer;. Collections may be imported or exported using a variety of formats, to allow for easy exchange or publication of data.
What & appname; Is Not
& appname; is not an audio or video player. It does not provide facilities for reading or modifying multimedia files. It also does not provide any image-editing functionality. Although & appname; has some functionality for managing bibliography lists, it is not a full-blown bibliographic reference manager. & appname; also does not pretend to have all the capabilities of a full-fledged relational database.
As somewhat of a disclaimer, & appname; is a hobby for the author, and no guarantees are made about its functionality, usefullness, or otherwise. It's very far from being a professional software package. More information is included in the license declaration.
Terminology
Collections
In & appname;, a collection is the document. Only one collection exists in each & appname; file. A collection contains any number of fields and entries. & appname; supports 12 specific collection types by default: books, bibliographic entries, comic books, videos, music, trading cards, coins, stamps, video games, wines, board games, and file listings. In addition, an empty generic collection template is available for any other type of collectibles or lists.
Collection Fields
Each collection may have an unlimited number of fields. & appname; supports eleven types of fields, which allow for a range of different data. The fields can be edited with the Collection Fields Dialog "and are explained further in the Field Types section.
Collection Entries
An entry is the basic record in & appname;. Each entry contains a single value for each field in the collection. A collection may have an unlimited number of entries, in theory, although since the whole collection is always resident in memory, too many entries could slow down the application.
& appname; has been tested with a collection of 10,000 entries, and the speed was satisfactory. However, if many large images are included in the collection, the loading and processing time does slow down greatly. Performance can be improved by having & appname; store images separate from the data file itself, either in the application-specific folder or a folder relative to the data file. More information can be found in the configuration section.
