ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
TRAZEC 60 mg film-coated tablets
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each film-coated tablet contains 60 mg nateglinide.
Excipients:
Lactose monohydrate:
141.5 mg per tablet.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Film-coated tablet
60 mg pink, round, bevelled-edge tablets with “ NVR” marked on one side and “ TS” on the other.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Nateglinide is indicated for combination therapy with metformin in type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled despite a maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Nateglinide should be taken within 1 to 30 minutes before meals (usually breakfast, lunch and dinner).
The dosage of nateglinide should be determined by the physician according to the patient’ s requirements.
The recommended starting dose is 60 mg three times daily before meals, particularly in patients who are near goal HbA1c.
This may be increased to 120 mg three times daily.
Dose adjustments should be based on periodic glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements.
Since the primary therapeutic effect of Trazec is to reduce mealtime glucose, (a contributor to HbA1c), the therapeutic response to Trazec may also be monitored with 1– 2 hour post-meal glucose.
The recommended maximum daily dose is 180 mg three times daily to be taken before the three main meals.
Specific patient groups Elderly The clinical experience in patients over 75 years of age is limited.
Children and adolescents There are no data available on the use of nateglinide in patients under 18 years of age, and therefore its use in this age group is not recommended.
Patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
As patients with severe liver disease were not studied, nateglinide is contraindicated in this group.
2 Patients with renal impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.
Although there is a 49% decrease in Cmax of nateglinide in dialysis patients, the systemic availability and half-life in diabetic subjects with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 15– 50 ml/ min) was comparable between renal subjects requiring haemodialysis and healthy subjects.
Although safety was not compromised in this population dose adjustment may be required in view of low Cmax.
Others In debilitated or malnourished patients the initial and maintenance dosage should be conservative and careful titration is required to avoid hypoglycaemic reactions.
4.3 Contraindications
Trazec is contraindicated in patients with: • Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients • Type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, C-peptide negative) • Diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma • Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6) • Severe hepatic impairment
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General Nateglinide should not be used in monotherapy.
Like other insulin secretagogues, nateglinide is capable of producing hypoglycaemia.
Hypoglycaemia has been observed in patients with type 2 diabetes on diet and exercise, and in those treated with oral antidiabetic agents (see section 4.8).
Elderly, malnourished patients and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or severe renal impairment are more susceptible to the glucose- lowering effect of these treatments.
The risk of hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetic patients may be increased by strenuous physical exercise, or ingestion of alcohol.
Symptoms of hypoglycaemia (unconfirmed by blood glucose levels) were observed in patients whose baseline HbA1c was close to the therapeutic target (HbA1c < 7.5%).
Combination with metformin is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia compared to monotherapy.
Hypoglycaemia may be difficult to recognise in subjects receiving beta blockers.
When a patient stabilised on any oral hypoglycaemic agent is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection or surgery, a loss of glycaemic control may occur.
At such times, it may be necessary to discontinue oral hypoglycaemic treatment and replace it with insulin on a temporary basis.
Trazec contains lactose monohydrate.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, of the Lapp lactase deficiency or of glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.
Specific patient groups Nateglinide should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.
No clinical studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment or children and adolescents.
Treatment is therefore not recommended in these patient groups.
3 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products influence glucose metabolism and possible interactions should therefore be taken into account by the physician:
The following agents may enhance the hypoglycaemic effect of nateglinide: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI).
The following agents may reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of nateglinide: diuretics, corticosteroids, and beta2 agonists.
When these medicinal products are administered to or withdrawn from patients receiving nateglinide, the patient should be observed closely for changes in glycaemic control.
Data available from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that nateglinide is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C9 with involvement of CYP3A4 to a smaller extent.
In an interaction trial with sulfinpyrazone, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, a modest increase in nateglinide AUC (~28%) was observed in healthy volunteers, with no changes in the mean Cmax and elimination half-life.
A more prolonged effect and possibly a risk of hypoglycaemia cannot be excluded in patients when nateglinide is co-administered with CYP2C9 inhibitors.
Particular caution is recommended when nateglinide is co-administered with other more potent inhibitors of CYP2C9, e. g. fluconazole or gemfibrozil, or in patients known to be poor metabolisers for CYP2C9.
Interaction studies with a 3A4 inhibitor have not been carried out in vivo.
In vivo, nateglinide has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.
The pharmacokinetics of warfarin (a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP2C9), diclofenac (a substrate for CYP2C9), and digoxin were unaffected by coadministration with nateglinide.
Conversely, these medicinal products had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of nateglinide.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for digoxin, warfarin or other drugs that are CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 substrates upon coadministration with Trazec.
Similarly, there was no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction of Trazec with other oral antidiabetic agents such as metformin or glibenclamide.
Nateglinide has shown a low potential for protein displacement in in vitro studies.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Studies in animals have shown developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
There is no experience in pregnant women, therefore the safety of Trazec in pregnant women cannot be assessed.
Trazec, like other oral antidiabetic agents, is not recommended for use in pregnancy.
Nateglinide is excreted in the milk following a peroral dose to lactating rats.
Although it is not known whether nateglinide is excreted in human milk, the potential for hypoglycaemia in breast-fed infants may exist and therefore nateglinide should not be used in lactating women.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving or operating machinery.
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia.
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances.
4 4.8 Undesirable effects
Based on the experience with nateglinide and with other hypoglycaemic agents, the following adverse reactions have been seen.
Frequencies are defined as: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10); uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100); rare (> 1/10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/10 ,000).
Hypoglycaemia As with other antidiabetic agents, symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia have been observed after administration of nateglinide.
These symptoms included sweating, trembling, dizziness, increased appetite, palpitations, nausea, fatigue, and weakness.
These were generally mild in nature and easily handled by intake of carbohydrates when necessary.
In completed clinical trials, symptoms of hypoglycaemia were reported in 10.4% with nateglinide monotherapy, 14.5% with nateglinide+metformin combination, 6.9% with metformin alone, 19.8% with glibenclamide alone, and 4.1% with placebo.
Immune system disorders Rare:
Hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, itching and urticaria.
Metabolism and nutrition disorders Common:
Symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia.
Gatrointestinal disorders Common:
Abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, nausea.
Uncommon:
Vomiting.
Hepatobiliary disorders Rare:
Elevations in liver enzymes.
Other events Other adverse events observed in clinical studies were of a similar incidence in Trazec-treated and placebo-treated patients.
Post-marketing data revealed very rare cases of erythema multiforme.
4.9 Overdose
In a clinical study in patients, Trazec was administered in increasing doses up to 720 mg a day for 7 days and was well tolerated.
There is no experience of an overdose of Trazec in clinical trials.
However, an overdose may result in an exaggerated glucose-lowering effect, with the development of hypoglycaemic symptoms.
Hypoglycaemic symptoms without loss of consciousness or neurological findings should be treated with oral glucose and adjustments in dosage and/ or meal patterns.
Severe hypoglycaemic reactions with coma, seizure or other neurological symptoms should be treated with intravenous glucose.
As nateglinide is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not an efficient means of removing it from the blood.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
D-phenylalanine derivative, ATC code:
A10 BX 03
Nateglinide is an amino acid (phenylalanine) derivative, which is chemically and pharmacologically distinct from other antidiabetic agents.
Nateglinide is a rapid, short-acting oral insulin secretagogue.
Its effect is dependent on functioning beta cells in the pancreas islets.
Early insulin secretion is a mechanism for the maintenance of normal glycaemic control.
Nateglinide,
5 when taken before a meal, restores early or first phase insulin secretion, which is lost in patients with type 2 diabetes, resulting in a reduction in post-meal glucose and HbA1c.
Nateglinide closes ATP-dependent potassium channels in the beta-cell membrane with characteristics that distinguish it from other sulphonylurea receptor ligands.
This depolarises the beta cell and leads to an opening of the calcium channels.
The resulting calcium influx enhances insulin secretion.
Electrophysiological studies demonstrate that nateglinide has 45– 300-fold selectivity for pancreatic beta cell versus cardiovascular K+ATP channels.
In type 2 diabetic patients, the insulinotropic response to a meal occurs within the first 15 minutes following an oral dose of nateglinide.
This results in a blood-glucose-lowering effect throughout the meal period.
Insulin levels return to baseline within 3 to 4 hours, reducing post-meal hyperinsulinaemia.
Nateglinide-induced insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is glucose-sensitive, such that less insulin is secreted as glucose levels fall.
Conversely, the coadministration of food or a glucose infusion results in an enhancement of insulin secretion.
In combination with metformin, which mainly affected fasting plasma glucose, the effect of nateglinide on HbA1c was additive compared to either agent alone.
Nateglinide efficacy was inferior to that of metformin in monotherapy (decrease in HbA1c (%) with metformin 500 mg three times daily monotherapy: – 1.23 [95% CI: – 1.48; – 0.99] and with nateglinide 120 mg three times daily monotherapy – 0.90 [95% CI: – 1.14; – 0.66]).
The efficacy of nateglinide in combination with metformin has been compared to the combination of gliclazide plus metformin in a 6-month randomised, double-blind trial in 262 patients using a superiority design.
The decrease from baseline in HbA1c was – 0.41% in the nateglinide plus metformin group and – 0.57% in the gliclazide plus metformin group (difference 0.17%, [95% CI – 0.03, 0.36]).
Both treatments were well tolerated.
An outcome study has not been conducted with nateglinide, therefore the long-term benefits associated with improved glycaemic control have not been demonstrated.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption and bioavailability Nateglinide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of Trazec tablets prior to a meal, with mean peak drug concentration generally occurring in less than 1 hour.
Nateglinide is rapidly and almost completely (≥ 90%) absorbed from an oral solution.
Absolute oral bioavailability is estimated to be 72%.
In type 2 diabetic patients given Trazec over the dose range 60 to 240 mg before three meals per day for one week, nateglinide showed linear pharmacokinetics for both AUC and Cmax, and tmax was independent of dose.
Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of nateglinide based on intravenous data is estimated to be approximately 10 litres.
In vitro studies show that nateglinide is extensively bound (97– 99%) to serum proteins, mainly serum albumin and to a lesser extent alpha1-acid glycoprotein.
The extent of serum protein binding is independent of drug concentration over the test range of 0.1– 10 μ g Trazec/ ml.
Metabolism Nateglinide is extensively metabolised.
The main metabolites found in humans result from hydroxylation of the isopropyl side-chain, either on the methine carbon, or one of the methyl groups; activity of the main metabolites is about 5– 6 and 3 times less potent than nateglinide, respectively.
Minor metabolites identified were a diol, an isopropene and acyl glucuronide(s) of nateglinide; only the isopropene minor metabolite possesses activity, which is almost as potent as nateglinide.
Data available from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that nateglinide is predominantly
6 metabolised by CYP2C9 with involvement of CYP3A4 to a smaller extent.
Excretion Nateglinide and its metabolites are rapidly and completely eliminated.
Most of the [14C] nateglinide is excreted in the urine (83%), with an additional 10% eliminated in the faeces.
Approximately 75% of the administered [14C] nateglinide is recovered in the urine within six hours post-dose.
Approximately 6– 16% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug.
Plasma concentrations decline rapidly and the elimination half-life of nateglinide typically averaged 1.5 hours in all studies of Trazec in volunteers and type 2 diabetic patients.
Consistent with its short elimination half-life, there is no apparent accumulation of nateglinide upon multiple dosing with up to 240 mg three times daily.
Food effect When given post-prandially, the extent of nateglinide absorption (AUC) remains unaffected.
However, there is a delay in the rate of absorption characterised by a decrease in Cmax and a delay in time to peak plasma concentration (tmax).
It is recommended that Trazec be administered prior to meals.
It is usually taken immediately (1 minute) before a meal but may be taken up to 30 minutes before meals.
Sub-populations Elderly:
Age did not influence the pharmacokinetic properties of nateglinide.
Hepatic impairment:
The systemic availability and half-life of nateglinide in non-diabetic subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment did not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in healthy subjects.
Renal impairment:
The systemic availability and half-life of nateglinide in diabetic patients with mild, moderate (creatinine clearance 31– 50 ml/ min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15– 30 ml/ min) renal impairment (not undergoing dialysis) did not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in healthy subjects.
There is a 49% decrease in Cmax of nateglinide in dialysis-dependent diabetic patients.
The systemic availability and half-life in dialysis-dependent diabetic patients was comparable with healthy subjects.
Although safety was not compromised in this population dose adjustment may be required in view of low Cmax.
Gender:
No clinically significant differences in nateglinide pharmacokinetics were observed between men and women.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Preclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to fertility and post-natal development.
Nateglinide was not teratogenic in rats.
In rabbits, at maternally toxic doses a higher incidence of foetuses with no gallbladder was observed.

4.2 Posology and method of administration
Nateglinide should be taken within 1 to 30 minutes before meals (usually breakfast, lunch and dinner).
The dosage of nateglinide should be determined by the physician according to the patient’ s requirements.

Specific patient groups Elderly The clinical experience in patients over 75 years of age is limited.
Children and adolescents There are no data available on the use of nateglinide in patients under 18 years of age, and therefore its use in this age group is not recommended.
Patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
As patients with severe liver disease were not studied, nateglinide is contraindicated in this group.
9 Patients with renal impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.
Although there is a 49% decrease in Cmax of nateglinide in dialysis patients, the systemic availability and half-life in diabetic subjects with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 15– 50 ml/ min) was comparable between renal subjects requiring haemodialysis and healthy subjects.

Others In debilitated or malnourished patients the initial and maintenance dosage should be conservative and careful titration is required to avoid hypoglycaemic reactions.
4.3 Contraindications
Trazec is contraindicated in patients with: • Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients • Type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, C-peptide negative) • Diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma • Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6) • Severe hepatic impairment
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General Nateglinide should not be used in monotherapy.
Like other insulin secretagogues, nateglinide is capable of producing hypoglycaemia.
Hypoglycaemia has been observed in patients with type 2 diabetes on diet and exercise, and in those treated with oral antidiabetic agents (see section 4.8).
Elderly, malnourished patients and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or severe renal impairment are more susceptible to the glucose- lowering effect of these treatments.
The risk of hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetic patients may be increased by strenuous physical exercise, or ingestion of alcohol.
Symptoms of hypoglycaemia (unconfirmed by blood glucose levels) were observed in patients whose baseline HbA1c was close to the therapeutic target (HbA1C < 7.5%).
Combination with metformin is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia compared to monotherapy.
Hypoglycaemia may be difficult to recognise in subjects receiving beta blockers.
When a patient stabilised on any oral hypoglycaemic agent is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection or surgery, a loss of glycaemic control may occur.
At such times, it may be necessary to discontinue oral hypoglycaemic treatment and replace it with insulin on a temporary basis.
Trazec contains lactose monohydrate.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, of the Lapp lactase deficiency or of glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.
Specific patient groups Nateglinide should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.
No clinical studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment or children and adolescents.
Treatment is therefore not recommended in these patient groups.
10 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products influence glucose metabolism and possible interactions should therefore be taken into account by the physician:
The following agents may enhance the hypoglycaemic effect of nateglinide: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI).
The following agents may reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of nateglinide: diuretics, corticosteroids, and beta2 agonists.
When these medicinal products are administered to or withdrawn from patients receiving nateglinide, the patient should be observed closely for changes in glycaemic control.
Data available from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that nateglinide is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C9 with involvement of CYP3A4 to a smaller extent.
In an interaction trial with sulfinpyrazone, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, a modest increase in nateglinide AUC (~28%) was observed in healthy volunteers, with no changes in the mean Cmax and elimination half-life.
A more prolonged effect and possibly a risk of hypoglycaemia cannot be excluded in patients when nateglinide is co-administered with CYP2C9 inhibitors.
Particular caution is recommended when nateglinide is co-administered with other more potent inhibitors of CYP2C9, e. g. fluconazole or gemfibrozil, or in patients known to be poor metabolisers for CYP2C9.
Interaction studies with a 3A4 inhibitor have not been carried out in vivo.
In vivo, nateglinide has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.
The pharmacokinetics of warfarin (a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP2C9), diclofenac (a substrate for CYP2C9), and digoxin were unaffected by coadministration with nateglinide.
Conversely, these medicinal products had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of nateglinide.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for digoxin, warfarin or other drugs that are CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 substrates upon coadministration with Trazec.
Similarly, there was no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction of Trazec with other oral antidiabetic agents such as metformin or glibenclamide.
Nateglinide has shown a low potential for protein displacement in in vitro studies.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Studies in animals have shown developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
There is no experience in pregnant women, therefore the safety of Trazec in pregnant women cannot be assessed.
Trazec, like other oral antidiabetic agents, is not recommended for use in pregnancy.
Nateglinide is excreted in the milk following a peroral dose to lactating rats.
Although it is not known whether nateglinide is excreted in human milk, the potential for hypoglycaemia in breast-fed infants may exist and therefore nateglinide should not be used in lactating women.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving or operating machinery.
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia.
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances.
11 4.8 Undesirable effects
Based on the experience with nateglinide and with other hypoglycaemic agents, the following adverse reactions have been seen.
Frequencies are defined as: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10); uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100); rare (> 1/10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/10 ,000).
Hypoglycaemia As with other antidiabetic agents, symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia have been observed after administration of nateglinide.
These symptoms included sweating, trembling, dizziness, increased appetite, palpitations, nausea, fatigue, and weakness.
These were generally mild in nature and easily handled by intake of carbohydrates when necessary.
In completed clinical trials, symptoms of hypoglycaemia were reported in 10.4% with nateglinide monotherapy, 14.5% with nateglinide+metformin combination, 6.9% with metformin alone, 19.8% with glibenclamide alone, and 4.1% with placebo.
Immune system disorders Rare:
Hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, itching and urticaria.
Metabolism and nutrition disorders Common:
Symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia.
Gatrointestinal disorders Common:
Abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, nausea.
Uncommon:
Vomiting.
Hepatobiliary disorders Rare:
Elevations in liver enzymes.
Other events Other adverse events observed in clinical studies were of a similar incidence in Trazec-treated and placebo-treated patients.
Post-marketing data revealed very rare cases of erythema multiforme.
4.9 Overdose
In a clinical study in patients, Trazec was administered in increasing doses up to 720 mg a day for 7 days and was well tolerated.
There is no experience of an overdose of Trazec in clinical trials.
However, an overdose may result in an exaggerated glucose-lowering effect, with the development of hypoglycaemic symptoms.
Hypoglycaemic symptoms without loss of consciousness or neurological findings should be treated with oral glucose and adjustments in dosage and/ or meal patterns.
Severe hypoglycaemic reactions with coma, seizure or other neurological symptoms should be treated with intravenous glucose.
As nateglinide is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not an efficient means of removing it from the blood.

The main metabolites found in humans result from hydroxylation of the isopropyl side-chain, either on the methine carbon, or one of the methyl groups; activity of the main metabolites is about 5– 6 and 3 times less potent than nateglinide, respectively.
Minor metabolites identified were a diol, an isopropene and acyl glucuronide(s) of nateglinide; only the isopropene minor metabolite possesses activity, which is almost as potent as nateglinide.
Data available from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that nateglinide is predominantly
13 metabolised by CYP2C9 with involvement of CYP3A4 to a smaller extent.
Excretion Nateglinide and its metabolites are rapidly and completely eliminated.
Most of the [14C] nateglinide is excreted in the urine (83%), with an additional 10% eliminated in the faeces.
Approximately 75% of the administered [14C] nateglinide is recovered in the urine within six hours post-dose.
Approximately 6– 16% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug.
Plasma concentrations decline rapidly and the elimination half-life of nateglinide typically averaged 1.5 hours in all studies of Trazec in volunteers and type 2 diabetic patients.
Consistent with its short elimination half-life, there is no apparent accumulation of nateglinide upon multiple dosing with up to 240 mg three times daily.
Food effect When given post-prandially, the extent of nateglinide absorption (AUC) remains unaffected.
However, there is a delay in the rate of absorption characterised by a decrease in Cmax and a delay in time to peak plasma concentration (tmax).
It is recommended that Trazec be administered prior to meals.
It is usually taken immediately (1 minute) before a meal but may be taken up to 30 minutes before meals.
Sub-populations Elderly:
Age did not influence the pharmacokinetic properties of nateglinide.
Hepatic impairment:
The systemic availability and half-life of nateglinide in non-diabetic subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment did not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in healthy subjects.
Renal impairment:
The systemic availability and half-life of nateglinide in diabetic patients with mild, moderate (creatinine clearance 31– 50 ml/ min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15– 30 ml/ min) renal impairment (not undergoing dialysis) did not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in healthy subjects.
There is a 49% decrease in Cmax of nateglinide in dialysis-dependent diabetic patients.
The systemic availability and half-life in dialysis-dependent diabetic patients was comparable with healthy subjects.
Although safety was not compromised in this population dose adjustment may be required in view of low Cmax.
Gender:
No clinically significant differences in nateglinide pharmacokinetics were observed between men and women.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Preclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to fertility and post-natal development.
Nateglinide was not teratogenic in rats.
In rabbits, at maternally toxic doses a higher incidence of foetuses with no gallbladder was observed.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each film-coated tablet contains 180 mg nateglinide.
Excipients:
Lactose monohydrate:
214 mg per tablet
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Film-coated tablet
180 mg red, ovaloid tablets with “ NVR” marked on one side and “ TSX” on the other.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Nateglinide is indicated for combination therapy with metformin in type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled despite a maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Nateglinide should be taken within 1 to 30 minutes before meals (usually breakfast, lunch and dinner).
The dosage of nateglinide should be determined by the physician according to the patient’ s requirements.
The recommended starting dose is 60 mg three times daily before meals, particularly in patients who are near goal HbA1c.
This may be increased to 120 mg three times daily.
Dose adjustments should be based on periodic glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements.
Since the primary therapeutic effect of Trazec is to reduce mealtime glucose, (a contributor to HbA1c), the therapeutic response to Trazec may also be monitored with 1– 2 hour post-meal glucose.
The recommended maximum daily dose is 180 mg three times daily to be taken before the three main meals.
Specific patient groups Elderly The clinical experience in patients over 75 years of age is limited.
Children and adolescents There are no data available on the use of nateglinide in patients under 18 years of age, and therefore its use in this age group is not recommended.
Patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
As patients with severe liver disease were not studied, nateglinide is contraindicated in this group.
16 Patients with renal impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.
Although there is a 49% decrease in Cmax of nateglinide in dialysis patients, the systemic availability and half-life in diabetic subjects with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 15– 50 ml/ min) was comparable between renal subjects requiring haemodialysis and healthy subjects.
Although safety was not compromised in this population dose adjustment may be required in view of low Cmax.
Others In debilitated or malnourished patients the initial and maintenance dosage should be conservative and careful titration is required to avoid hypoglycaemic reactions.
4.3 Contraindications
Trazec is contraindicated in patients with: • Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients • Type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, C-peptide negative) • Diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma • Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6) • Severe hepatic impairment
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General Nateglinide should not be used in monotherapy.
Like other insulin secretagogues, nateglinide is capable of producing hypoglycaemia.
Hypoglycaemia has been observed in patients with type 2 diabetes on diet and exercise, and in those treated with oral antidiabetic agents (see section 4.8).
Elderly, malnourished patients and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or severe renal impairment are more susceptible to the glucose- lowering effect of these treatments.
The risk of hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetic patients may be increased by strenuous physical exercise, or ingestion of alcohol.
Symptoms of hypoglycaemia (unconfirmed by blood glucose levels) were observed in patients whose baseline HbA1c was close to the therapeutic target (HbA1C < 7.5%).
Combination with metformin is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia compared to monotherapy.
Hypoglycaemia may be difficult to recognise in subjects receiving beta blockers.
When a patient stabilised on any oral hypoglycaemic agent is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection or surgery, a loss of glycaemic control may occur.
At such times, it may be necessary to discontinue oral hypoglycaemic treatment and replace it with insulin on a temporary basis.
Trazec contains lactose monohydrate.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, of the Lapp lactase deficiency or of glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.
Specific patient groups Nateglinide should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.
No clinical studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment or children and adolescents.
Treatment is therefore not recommended in these patient groups.
17 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products influence glucose metabolism and possible interactions should therefore be taken into account by the physician:
The following agents may enhance the hypoglycaemic effect of nateglinide: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI).
The following agents may reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of nateglinide: diuretics, corticosteroids, and beta2 agonists.
When these medicinal products are administered to or withdrawn from patients receiving nateglinide, the patient should be observed closely for changes in glycaemic control.
Data available from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that nateglinide is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C9 with involvement of CYP3A4 to a smaller extent.
In an interaction trial with sulfinpyrazone, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, a modest increase in nateglinide AUC (~28%) was observed in healthy volunteers, with no changes in the mean Cmax and elimination half-life.
A more prolonged effect and possibly a risk of hypoglycaemia cannot be excluded in patients when nateglinide is co-administered with CYP2C9 inhibitors.
Particular caution is recommended when nateglinide is co-administered with other more potent inhibitors of CYP2C9, e. g. fluconazole or gemfibrozil, or in patients known to be poor metabolisers for CYP2C9.
Interaction studies with a 3A4 inhibitor have not been carried out in vivo.
In vivo, nateglinide has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.
The pharmacokinetics of warfarin (a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP2C9), diclofenac (a substrate for CYP2C9), and digoxin were unaffected by coadministration with nateglinide.
Conversely, these medicinal products had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of nateglinide.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for digoxin, warfarin or other drugs that are CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 substrates upon coadministration with Trazec.
Similarly, there was no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction of Trazec with other oral antidiabetic agents such as metformin or glibenclamide.
Nateglinide has shown a low potential for protein displacement in in vitro studies.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Studies in animals have shown developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
There is no experience in pregnant women, therefore the safety of Trazec in pregnant women cannot be assessed.
Trazec, like other oral antidiabetic agents, is not recommended for use in pregnancy.
Nateglinide is excreted in the milk following a peroral dose to lactating rats.
Although it is not known whether nateglinide is excreted in human milk, the potential for hypoglycaemia in breast-fed infants may exist and therefore nateglinide should not be used in lactating women.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving or operating machinery.
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia.
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances.
18 4.8 Undesirable effects
Based on the experience with nateglinide and with other hypoglycaemic agents, the following adverse reactions have been seen.
Frequencies are defined as: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10); uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100); rare (> 1/10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/10 ,000).
Hypoglycaemia As with other antidiabetic agents, symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia have been observed after administration of nateglinide.
These symptoms included sweating, trembling, dizziness, increased appetite, palpitations, nausea, fatigue, and weakness.
These were generally mild in nature and easily handled by intake of carbohydrates when necessary.
In completed clinical trials, symptoms of hypoglycaemia were reported in 10.4% with nateglinide monotherapy, 14.5% with nateglinide+metformin combination, 6.9% with metformin alone, 19.8% with glibenclamide alone, and 4.1% with placebo.
Immune system disorders Rare:
Hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, itching and urticaria.
Metabolism and nutrition disorders Common:
Symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia.
Gatrointestinal disorders Common:
Abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, nausea.
Uncommon:
Vomiting.
Hepatobiliary disorders Rare:
Elevations in liver enzymes.
Other events Other adverse events observed in clinical studies were of a similar incidence in Trazec-treated and placebo-treated patients.
Post-marketing data revealed very rare cases of erythema multiforme.
4.9 Overdose
In a clinical study in patients, Trazec was administered in increasing doses up to 720 mg a day for 7 days and was well tolerated.
There is no experience of an overdose of Trazec in clinical trials.
However, an overdose may result in an exaggerated glucose-lowering effect, with the development of hypoglycaemic symptoms.
Hypoglycaemic symptoms without loss of consciousness or neurological findings should be treated with oral glucose and adjustments in dosage and/ or meal patterns.
Severe hypoglycaemic reactions with coma, seizure or other neurological symptoms should be treated with intravenous glucose.
As nateglinide is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not an efficient means of removing it from the blood.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
D-phenylalanine derivative, ATC code:
A10 BX 03
Nateglinide is an amino acid (phenylalanine) derivative, which is chemically and pharmacologically distinct from other antidiabetic agents.
Nateglinide is a rapid, short-acting oral insulin secretagogue.
Its effect is dependent on functioning beta cells in the pancreas islets.
Early insulin secretion is a mechanism for the maintenance of normal glycaemic control.
Nateglinide,
19 when taken before a meal, restores early or first phase insulin secretion, which is lost in patients with type 2 diabetes, resulting in a reduction in post-meal glucose and HbA1c.
Nateglinide closes ATP-dependent potassium channels in the beta-cell membrane with characteristics that distinguish it from other sulphonylurea receptor ligands.
This depolarises the beta cell and leads to an opening of the calcium channels.
The resulting calcium influx enhances insulin secretion.
Electrophysiological studies demonstrate that nateglinide has 45– 300-fold selectivity for pancreatic beta cell versus cardiovascular K+ATP channels.
In type 2 diabetic patients, the insulinotropic response to a meal occurs within the first 15 minutes following an oral dose of nateglinide.
This results in a blood-glucose-lowering effect throughout the meal period.
Insulin levels return to baseline within 3 to 4 hours, reducing post-meal hyperinsulinaemia.
Nateglinide-induced insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is glucose-sensitive, such that less insulin is secreted as glucose levels fall.
Conversely, the coadministration of food or a glucose infusion results in an enhancement of insulin secretion.
In combination with metformin, which mainly affected fasting plasma glucose, the effect of nateglinide on HbA1c was additive compared to either agent alone.
Nateglinide efficacy was inferior to that of metformin in monotherapy (decrease in HbA1c (%) with metformin 500 mg three times daily monotherapy: – 1.23 [95% CI: – 1.48; – 0.99] and with nateglinide 120 mg three times daily monotherapy – 0.90 [95% CI: – 1.14; – 0.66]).
The efficacy of nateglinide in combination with metformin has been compared to the combination of gliclazide plus metformin in a 6-month randomised, double-blind trial in 262 patients using a superiority design.
The decrease from baseline in HbA1c was – 0.41% in the nateglinide plus metformin group and – 0.57% in the gliclazide plus metformin group (difference 0.17%, [95% CI – 0.03, 0.36]).
Both treatments were well tolerated.
An outcome study has not been conducted with nateglinide, therefore the long-term benefits associated with improved glycaemic control have not been demonstrated.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption and bioavailability Nateglinide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration of Trazec tablets prior to a meal, with mean peak drug concentration generally occurring in less than 1 hour.
Nateglinide is rapidly and almost completely (≥ 90%) absorbed from an oral solution.
Absolute oral bioavailability is estimated to be 72%.
In type 2 diabetic patients given Trazec over the dose range 60 to 240 mg before three meals per day for one week, nateglinide showed linear pharmacokinetics for both AUC and Cmax, and tmax was independent of dose.
Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of nateglinide based on intravenous data is estimated to be approximately 10 litres.
In vitro studies show that nateglinide is extensively bound (97– 99%) to serum proteins, mainly serum albumin and to a lesser extent alpha1-acid glycoprotein.
The extent of serum protein binding is independent of drug concentration over the test range of 0.1– 10 μ g Trazec/ ml.
Metabolism Nateglinide is extensively metabolised.
The main metabolites found in humans result from hydroxylation of the isopropyl side-chain, either on the methine carbon, or one of the methyl groups; activity of the main metabolites is about 5– 6 and 3 times less potent than nateglinide, respectively.
Minor metabolites identified were a diol, an isopropene and acyl glucuronide(s) of nateglinide; only the isopropene minor metabolite possesses activity, which is almost as potent as nateglinide.
Data available from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that nateglinide is predominantly
20 metabolised by CYP2C9 with involvement of CYP3A4 to a smaller extent.
Excretion Nateglinide and its metabolites are rapidly and completely eliminated.
Most of the [14C] nateglinide is excreted in the urine (83%), with an additional 10% eliminated in the faeces.
Approximately 75% of the administered [14C] nateglinide is recovered in the urine within six hours post-dose.
Approximately 6– 16% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug.
Plasma concentrations decline rapidly and the elimination half-life of nateglinide typically averaged 1.5 hours in all studies of Trazec in volunteers and type 2 diabetic patients.
Consistent with its short elimination half-life, there is no apparent accumulation of nateglinide upon multiple dosing with up to 240 mg three times daily.
Food effect When given post-prandially, the extent of nateglinide absorption (AUC) remains unaffected.
However, there is a delay in the rate of absorption characterised by a decrease in Cmax and a delay in time to peak plasma concentration (tmax).
It is recommended that Trazec be administered prior to meals.
It is usually taken immediately (1 minute) before a meal but may be taken up to 30 minutes before meals.
Sub-populations Elderly:
Age did not influence the pharmacokinetic properties of nateglinide.
Hepatic impairment:
The systemic availability and half-life of nateglinide in non-diabetic subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment did not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in healthy subjects.
Renal impairment:
The systemic availability and half-life of nateglinide in diabetic patients with mild, moderate (creatinine clearance 31– 50 ml/ min) and severe (creatinine clearance 15– 30 ml/ min) renal impairment (not undergoing dialysis) did not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in healthy subjects.
There is a 49% decrease in Cmax of nateglinide in dialysis-dependent diabetic patients.
The systemic availability and half-life in dialysis-dependent diabetic patients was comparable with healthy subjects.
Although safety was not compromised in this population dose adjustment may be required in view of low Cmax.
Gender:
No clinically significant differences in nateglinide pharmacokinetics were observed between men and women.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Preclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to fertility and post-natal development.
Nateglinide was not teratogenic in rats.
In rabbits, at maternally toxic doses a higher incidence of foetuses with no gallbladder was observed.

WHAT TRAZEC IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Trazec is a medicine to lower blood sugar (glucose), which is taken by mouth (these medicines are also known as oral anti-diabetics).
It is used by people with type 2 diabetes.
(This kind of diabetes is also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.)
Insulin is a substance produced by a body organ called the pancreas.
It helps to decrease blood sugar levels, especially after meals.
In patients with type 2 diabetes, the body may not start producing insulin quickly enough after meals.
Trazec works by stimulating the pancreas to produce insulin more quickly.
This helps to keep the blood sugar controlled after meals.
Your doctor will prescribe Trazec together with another oral anti-diabetic containing metformin.
Trazec tablets start to act quickly after you take them and are eliminated from the body rapidly.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE TRAZEC
Follow all instructions given to you by your doctor and pharmacist carefully, even if they are different from what is in this leaflet.
Do not take Trazec
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to nateglinide or any of the other ingredients of Trazec.
- if you have type 1 diabetes (i. e. your body does not produce any insulin).
- if you know that you have a severe liver problem.
- if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
- if you are breast-feeding.
Talk to your doctor if you have any further questions or you think that any of these may apply to you.
37 Take special care with Trazec People with diabetes sometimes get symptoms of low blood sugar (also called hypoglycaemia).
Medicines, including Trazec, may also produce symptoms of low blood sugar.
If you get any of these symptoms – feeling dizzy, light-headed, hungry, shaky or any of the other signs in section 4, “ Possible side effects” – eat or drink something containing sugar.
Some people are more likely to get symptoms of low blood sugar than others.
Take care
- if you are over 65 years of age.
- if you are undernourished.
- if you have another medical condition that may cause low blood sugar (e. g. an under-active
pituitary or adrenal gland).
If any of these apply to you, monitor your blood sugar levels more carefully.
Talk to your doctor
- if you know that you have a liver problem.
- if you have a severe kidney problem.
- if you have problems of drug metabolism.
- if you are due to have an operation.
- if you have suffered a fever, an accident or an infection.
Your treatment may need to be adjusted.
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
The amount of Trazec that you need may change if you take other medicines as these may cause your blood sugar levels to go up or down.
It is especially important that you tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking:
- Beta blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (used, for example, to treat high
blood pressure and certain heart conditions).
- Diuretics (used in the treatment of high blood pressure).
- Corticosteroids such as prednisone and cortisone (used to treat inflammatory disorders).
- Inhibitors of drug metabolism such as fluconazole (used to treat fungal infection), gemfibrozil
(used to treat dyslipidaemia) or sulfinpyrazone (used to treat chronic gout).
Your doctor may adjust the dose of these medicines.
Food, drink and exercise Take Trazec before meals (see section 3, “ How to take Trazec”).
Its effect may be delayed if it is taken during or after meals.
Even though you are taking medicines for your diabetes, it is important to keep following the diet and/ or exercise your doctor has recommended for you.
Watch carefully for signs of low blood sugar, especially
- if you have exercised more strenuously than usual.
- if you have drunk alcohol.
Alcohol may upset the control of your blood sugar so you are advised to talk to your doctor about drinking alcohol while taking Trazec.
If you do get symptoms of low blood sugar, eat or drink something containing sugar and talk to your doctor.
Trazec and older people Trazec can be used by people over 65 years of age.
Take special care to avoid low blood sugar.
38 Trazec and children and adolescents Trazec is not recommended for children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) because its effects in this age group have not been studied.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Do not take Trazec if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
See your doctor as soon as possible if you become pregnant during treatment.
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Trazec.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or breast- feeding.
Driving and using machines You are advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving.
This is particularly important if you have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or if you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia.
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Trazec Trazec tablets contain lactose monohydrate.
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.
