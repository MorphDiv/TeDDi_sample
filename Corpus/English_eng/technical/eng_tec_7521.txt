EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
SEVOFLO
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report.
Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) on the basis of the documentation provided, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian.
If you need more information about your animal’ s medical condition or treatment, contact your veterinarian.
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is SevoFlo?
SevoFlo is 100% sevoflurane, a chemical which is a liquid at room temperature, but, when heated, becomes a gas (vaporises).
This gas is used as a general anaesthetic for dogs.
What is SevoFlo used for?
SevoFlo is used both to induce and maintain anaesthesia in dogs.
SevoFlo is administered using specialised anaesthetic equipment, usually in a carefully controlled gas mixture including oxygen.
The dog breathes in the gas mixture, which causes it to become unconscious.
How does SevoFlo work?
When a dog is given a mixture of oxygen and sevoflurane to breathe, the sevoflurane is inhaled into its lungs, from where it goes into the blood stream, crosses into the brain and induces an unconscious state.
At the end of surgery, the anaesthetic is discontinued.
When the concentration of anaesthetic in the brain drops below a certain level the dog wakes up.
How has SevoFlo been studied?
Data were provided on the pharmaceutical quality, the tolerance of the product in dogs, and its safety in humans (people in contact with the product) and the environment.
Studies were carried out in dogs, comparing the effectiveness of SevoFlo to that of other anaesthetic agents, such as isoflurane (another anaesthetic gas), thiopental, propofol, and ketamine plus diazepam, and SevoFlo’ s effectiveness at both inducing and maintaining anaesthesia was investigated.

In the studies, SevoFlo was equally efficacious when compared to other anaesthetic agents.
SevoFlo was shown to produce a relatively rapid and smooth induction of anaesthesia in dogs, followed by a good recovery.
Studies showed that sevoflurane could safely be used with several other medicines commonly used in dogs before or during operations.
What is the risk associated with SevoFlo?
The most frequently reported side effects associated with SevoFlo administration in dogs are low blood pressure, abnormally rapid breathing, muscle tenseness, excitation, a temporary inability to breathe, small muscle twitches, and vomiting.
The dose used for very old or very sick dogs may need to be adjusted.
SevoFlo should not be used in pregnant or lactating bitches or in dogs less than 12 weeks of age as there is limited clinical experience.
SevoFlo should not be used in dogs with a known or suspected sensitivity to such anaesthetics.
For a full list of all side-effects reported with SevoFlo, see the Package Leaflet.
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal?
This veterinary medicine has been developed especially for dogs and is not intended for use in humans.
As sevoflurane is a general anaesthetic, human exposure to sevoflurane vapour may cause symptoms such as shivering, nausea, headaches, low blood pressure, decreased heart rate and even reduced breathing.
Care must therefore be taken to remove any spillage immediately, the vapour should not be inhaled, and all contact with the product by mouth must be avoided.
Pregnant and breast-feeding women should not have any contact with the product and should also avoid operating rooms and animal recovery areas where the product is being, or has recently been, used.
In case of accidental contact with the skin or eyes, or for more information, the Package Leaflet should be consulted.
Why has SevoFlo been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) concluded that the benefits of SevoFlo exceed the risks in relation to its use for the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia in dogs and recommended that SevoFlo be given a marketing authorisation.
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR.
Other information about SevoFlo:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for SevoFlo to Abbott Laboratories Ltd on 11 December 2002.
Information on the prescription status of this product may be found on the outer package.
