Using the Panels
This chapter describes how to use the panels at the top and bottom of the GNOME Desktop, how to customize the objects that appear on them, and how to add new panels to the desktop.
panels
introduction
A panel is an area in the GNOME Desktop where you have access to certain actions and information, no matter what the state of your application windows. For example, in the default GNOME panels, you can launch applications, see the date and time, control the system sound volume, and more.
You can customize panels to your liking. You can change their behavior and appearance, and you can add or remove objects from your panels. You can create multiple panels, and choose different properties, objects, and backgrounds for each panel. You can also hide panels.
By default, the GNOME Desktop contains a panel at the top edge of the screen, and a panel at the bottom edge of the screen. The following sections describe these panels.
Top Edge Panel

Your vendor or system administrator can make configuration changes to suit your needs, so your desktop might not match exactly what is described in this manual. Nevertheless, this manual provides a useful introduction to using the various components of your desktop.
The Desktop
The desktop lies behind all other components on your screen. When no windows are visible, the desktop is that part of the screen between the top and bottom panels. You can place files and folders on the desktop that you want to have easy access to.
The desktop also has several special objects on it:

You can control a window's position of the screen, as well as its size. You can control which windows overlap other windows, so the one you want to work with is completely visible. For more about moving and resizing windows, see
Each window is not necessarily a different application. An application usually has one main window, and may open additional windows at the request of the user.
The rest of this section describes the different types of windows and how you can interact with them.
Types of Windows
There are two main types of window:
Application windows
Application windows allow all the minimize, maximize and close operations through the buttons on the titlebar. When opening an application you will usually see a window of this type appear.
Dialog windows
Dialog windows appear at the request of an application window. A dialog window may alert you to a problem, ask for confirmation of an action, or request input from you.
For example, if you tell an application to save a document, a dialog will ask you where you want to save the new file. If you tell an application to quit while it is still busy, it may ask you to confirm that you want it to abandon work in progress.
Some dialogs do not allow you to interact with the main application window until you have closed them: these are called
You can select the text in a dialog with the mouse. This allows you to copy it to the clipboard (by right-clicking the text and selecting
Manipulating Windows
You can change the size and position of windows on the screen. This allows you to see more than one application and do different tasks at the same time. For example, you might want to read text on a web page while writing with a word processor, or to change to another application to do a different task or check its progress.

Workspaces allow you to manage which windows are on your screen. You can imagine workspaces as being virtual screens, which you can switch between at any time. Every workspace contains the same desktop, the same panels, and the same menus. However, you can run different applications, and open different windows in each workspace. The applications in each workspace will remain there when you switch to other workspaces.
By default, four workspaces are available. You can switch between them with the

All GNOME applications have many features in common, which makes it easier to learn how to work with a new GNOME application. The rest of this section describes some of these features.
Common Features
The applications that are provided with the GNOME Desktop share many common features, such as similar open and save dialogs and similar-looking icons. This is because they have all been developed using the GNOME development platform. An application developed using this platform is called a

Filtering the File List
You can restrict the file list to show only files of certain types. To do this, choose a file type from the drop-down list beneath the file list pane. The list of file types depends on the application you are currently using. For example, a graphics application will list different image file formats, and a text editor will list different types of text file.
Find-as-you-type
If you know the name of the file you want to open, begin typing it: the file list will jump to show you files whose names begin with the characters you type. Arrow keys will now select from only these files. The characters you have typed appear in a pop-up window at the base of the file list.

The file manager lets you organize your files into folders. Folders can contain files and may also contain other folders. Using folders can help you find your files more easily.

Every user has a Home Folder. The Home Folder contains all of the user's files. The desktop is another folder. The desktop contains special icons allowing easy access to the users Home Folder, Trash, and also removable media such as floppy disks, CDs and USB flashdrives.

In GNOME many things are files, such as word processor documents, spreadsheets, photos, movies, and music.
File Manager Presentation

Spatial mode is the default in GNOME, but your distributor, vendor, or system administrator may have configured
The following explains the difference between the two modes:
Browser mode: browse your files and folders
The file manager window represents a browser, which can display any location. Opening a folder updates the current file manager window to show the contents of the new folder.
As well as the folder contents, the browser window displays a toolbar with common actions and locations, a location bar that shows the current location in the hierarchy of folders, and a sidebar that can hold different kinds of information.
In Browser Mode, you typically have fewer file manager windows open at a time. For more information on using browser mode see

Nautilus in browser mode.
Spatial mode: navigate your files and folders as objects
The file manager window represents a particular folder. Opening a folder opens the new window for that folder. Each time you open a particular folder, you will find its window displayed in the same place on the screen and the same size as the last time you viewed it (this is the reason for the name 'spatial mode').
Using spatial mode may lead to more open file manager windows on the screen. On the other hand, some users find that representing files and folders as though they were real physical objects with particular locations makes it easier to work with them. For more information on using spatial mode see
Three Folders Opened in Spatial Mode.

File Permissions
Permissions are settings assigned to each file and folder that determine what type of access users can have to the file or folder. For example, you can determine whether other users can read and edit a file that belongs to you, or only have access to read it but not make changes to it.
Each file belongs to a particular user, and is associated with a group that the owner belongs to. The super user "root" has the ability to access any file on the system.
You can set permissions for three categories of users:
Owner
The user that created the file or folder.
Group
A group of users to which the owner belongs.
Others
All other users not already included.
For each category of user, different permissions can be set. These behave differently for files and folders, as follows:
read
Files can be opened
Directory contents can be displayed
write
Files can be edited or deleted
Directory contents can be modified
execute
Executable files can be run as a program

Basic Skills
This chapter introduces you to the basic skills that you need to work with the GNOME Desktop.
Mouse Skills
basic skills
mouse skills
This section describes what the mouse buttons do, and what the different pointers mean.
A mouse is a pointing device that lets you move the mouse pointer on the screen. The mouse pointer is usually a small arrow with which you point to objects on your screen. Pressing a mouse button will perform a particular action on the object over which your mouse pointer is situated, depending on which button you press.
Mouse Button Conventions
button conventions
The instructions in this manual are for three buttoned, right handed mouse devices, the most common type. If you use another type of mouse or pointing device, you should take care to locate the corresponding buttons on your mouse. If you use a left-handed mouse see the paragraph on setting mouse orientation below.
If you set your mouse device to be left handed, you should reverse the mouse button conventions used in this manual. This is normally also implied in most documentation and in many applications.
Some mice lack a middle button. If you have a two-button mouse device, then your system may be configured to use
The mouse button conventions used in this manual are as follows:
Left mouse button
The button on the left side of a mouse device. This is the main mouse button, used for selecting, activating, pressing buttons etc... When you are told to "click" it is implied that you should click with the left button, unless specifically stated.
Middle mouse button
The middle button of a mouse device. On many mice with a scroll wheel, the scroll wheel can be pushed down for a middle mouse button click.
Right mouse button
The button on the right side of a mouse device. Often, this button displays a context menu for the object under the pointer.

Press and do not release the left mouse button, and then move the mouse with the button still held down, and finally release the button.
Dragging with the mouse is used in many different contexts. This moves an object around the screen with the mouse. The object is
For example, you can change the position of a window by dragging on its title bar, or move a file by dragging its icon from one window and dropping it on another.
The left mouse buttons is usually used to perform drag actions, although the middle mouse button is sometimes used for an alternate drag action.
Click-and-hold
Press and do not release the left mouse button.
actions
You can perform the following actions with the mouse:
Select text.
Select items.
Drag items.
Activate items.
Paste text.
Move items.
Move windows to the back.
Use the right mouse button to open a context menu for an item, if a menu applies. For most items, you can also use the
For example, when viewing files in the file manager, you select a file by clicking with the left mouse button and open a file by double-clicking with the left mouse button. Clicking with the right mouse button will bring up a context menu for that file.
In most applications, you can select text with your left mouse button and paste it in another application using the middle mouse button. This is called primary selection paste, and works separately from your normal clipboard operations.
To select more than one item, you can hold the
Mouse Pointers

pointers
mouse pointers
As you use the mouse, the appearance of the mouse pointer can change. The appearance of the pointer provides feedback about a particular operation, location, or state.
The following mouse pointers are shown as your mouse passes over different elements of the screen:
Your mouse pointers will differ from those shown here if you are using a different
Normal pointer.

This pointer appears during normal use of the mouse.
Busy pointer.

This pointer appears over a window that is busy performing a task. You cannot use the mouse to give this window any input, but you can move to another window and work with that.
Resize pointer.

This pointer indicates that you can grab the control to resize parts of the interface. This appears over the borders of windows and over resize handles between panes in a window. The direction of the arrows indicates in which direction you can resize.
Hand pointer

This pointer appears when you hover over a
I-beam pointer

This pointer is shown when the mouse is over text that you can select or edit. Click to place the cursor where you want to type text, or drag to select text.
The following mouse pointers are shown when dragging an item such as a file, or a piece of text. They indicate the result of releasing the mouse button to drop the object being moved.

This pointer indicates that when you drop the object, the object is moved from the old location to the new location.

This pointer indicates that when you drop the object, a copy of the object is created where you drop it.

This pointer indicates that when you drop the object, a

This pointer indicates that when you drop the object, you will be given a choice of what to do. A menu will open to allow you to choose which operation you would like to perform. For instance, you may be able to move, copy, or create a symbolic link.
Not available pointer.

This pointer indicates that you cannot drop the object at the current location. Releasing the mouse button now will have no effect: the dragged object will be returned to its starting location.
Move panel object pointer.

This pointer appears when you drag a panel or a panel object with the middle mouse button. See
Move window pointer.

This pointer appears when you drag a window to move it. See
Keyboard Skills
keyboard skills
For almost every task that you can perform with the mouse, you can use the keyboard to perform the same task.
You can use shortcut keys to perform general GNOME Desktop tasks and to work with interface items such as panels and windows. You can also use shortcut keys in applications. To customize your shortcut keys, use the
Many PC keyboards come with two special keys for the Windows operating system: a key with a Microsoft Windows™ logo and a key for accessing context menus.
In GNOME, the Windows key is often configured to act as an additional modifier key, called the
You can also modify the GNOME Desktop preferences to use keyboard accessibility features. See
The following sections describe the shortcut keys that you can use throughout the desktop and applications.
Global Shortcut Keys
