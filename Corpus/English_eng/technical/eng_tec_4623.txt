(PHP 3 = 3.0.8, PHP 4)
range() returns an array of elements from low to high, inclusive.
If low high, the sequence will be from high to low.
New parameter:
The optional step parameter was added in 5.0.0.
If a step value is given, it will be used as the increment between elements in the sequence. step should be given as a positive number.
If not specified, step will default to 1.
Example 1. range() examples
?php / / array( 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) foreach(range(0, 9) as $number) {echo $number;} / / The step parameter was introduced in 5.0.0 / / array(0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100) foreach(range(0, 100, 10) as $number) {echo $number;} / / Use of characters introduced in 4.1.0 / / array('a' ,'b' ,'c' ,'d' ,'e' ,'f' ,'g' ,'h' ,'i'); foreach(range('a', 'i') as $letter) {echo $letter;} / / array('c' ,'b' ,'a'); foreach(range('c', 'a') as $letter) {echo $letter;}?
Note:
Prior to version 4.1.0 the range() function only generated incrementing integer arrays.
Support for character sequences and decrementing arrays was added in 4.1.0.
See also shuffle() and foreach.
