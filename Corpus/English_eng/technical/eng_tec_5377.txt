These functions allow you to access MySQL database servers.
More information about MySQL can be found at http: / /www.mysql.com /.
Documentation for MySQL can be found at http: / /www.mysql.com / documentation /.
In order to have these functions available, you must compile PHP with MySQL support.
By using the --with-mysql[ =DIR] configuration option you enable PHP to access MySQL databases.
If you use this option without specifying the path to MySQL, PHP will use the built-in MySQL client libraries.
With PHP 4 MySQL support is always enabled; if you don't specify the configure option, the bundled libraries are used.
Users who run other applications that use MySQL (for example, running PHP 3 and PHP 4 as concurrent apache modules, or auth-mysql) should always specify the path to MySQL: --with-mysql= / path / to / mysql.
This will force PHP to use the client libraries installed by MySQL, avoiding any conflicts.
The windows version of PHP The windows version of PHP has built in support for this extension.
You do not need to load any additional extension in order to use these functions.
Warning
Crashes and startup problems of PHP may be encountered when loading this extension in conjunction with the recode extension.
See the recode extension for more information.
The behaviour of these functions is affected by settings in php.ini.

Here is a short explanation of the configuration directives.
Whether to allow persistent connections to MySQL.
The maximum number of persistent MySQL connections per process.
The maximum number of MySQL connections per process, including persistent connections.
The default TCP port number to use when connecting to the database server if no other port is specified.
If no default is specified, the port will be obtained from the MYSQL_TCP_PORT environment variable, the mysql-tcp entry in / etc / services or the compile-time MYSQL_PORT constant, in that order.
Win32 will only use the MYSQL_PORT constant.
The default socket name to use when connecting to a local database server if no other socket name is specified.
The default server host to use when connecting to the database server if no other host is specified.
Doesn 't apply in safe mode.
The default user name to use when connecting to the database server if no other name is specified.
Doesn 't apply in safe mode.
The default password to use when connecting to the database server if no other password is specified.
Doesn 't apply in safe mode.
Connect timeout in seconds.
On Linux this timeout is also used for waiting for the first answer from the server.
There are two resource types used in the MySQL module.
The first one is the link identifier for a database connection, the second a resource which holds the result of a query.
The constants below are defined by this extension, and will only be available when the extension has either been compiled into PHP or dynamically loaded at runtime.
Since PHP 4.3.0 it is possible to specify additional client flags for the mysql_connect() and mysql_pconnect() functions.
The following constants are defined:
Table 2.
MySQL client constants
constant
description
MYSQL_CLIENT_COMPRESS
use compression protocol
MYSQL_CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE
Allow space after function names
MYSQL_CLIENT_INTERACTIVE
Allow interactive_timeout seconds (instead of wait_timeout) of inactivity before closing the connection.
The function mysql_fetch_array() uses a constant for the different types of result arrays.
The following constants are defined:
Table 3.
MySQL fetch constants
constant
description
MYSQL_ASSOC
Columns are returned into the array having the fieldname as the array index.
MYSQL_BOTH
Columns are returned into the array having both a numerical index and the fieldname as the array index.
MYSQL_NUM
Columns are returned into the array having a numerical index to the fields.
This index starts with 0, the first field in the result.
This simple example shows how to connect, execute a query, print resulting rows and disconnect from a MySQL database.
