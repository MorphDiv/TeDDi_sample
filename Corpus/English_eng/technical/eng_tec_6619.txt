Audio CD
Ogg Vorbis is a fully free and unencumbered compressed audio format that is perfect for storing your compressed music on your computer. The sound quality is slightly better than Mp3 at the same bitrate. Note that not all mobile players support the Ogg Vorbis format.
Flac is a lossless compressed audio format free of any patents or license fees. It maintains perfect CD audio quality while reducing file size by about 50%. Because the filesize is much larger than Ogg Vorbis or Mp3 it is not recommended if you want to transfer your music to a mobile player.
Wav is a basic, uncompressed audio file format. It takes up a lot of space but maintains perfect quality. It is generally not recommended unless you know what you are doing. If you want perfect quality, use Flac instead.
Mp3 is the de facto standard in compressed audio compatible with almost all mobile players. It is however non free and generally not recommended.
Audio CD settings - Amarok

Edit the filter for finding tracks with specific attributes, e. g. a track that has a length of three minutes.
Here you can choose to Simple Search directly or to use some keywords to specify some attributes, such as the artist name and so on. The keywords selectable are divided by their specific value. Some keywords are numeric and others are alphanumeric. You do not need to know it directly. When a keyword is numeric it will be used to search the numeric data for each track. The alphanumeric keywords are the following: album, artist, filename (including path), mountpoint (e. g. / home/ user1), filetype (you can specify mp3, ogg, flac,... and the file extensions will be matched), genre, comment, composer, directory, lyrics, title, and label. The numeric keywords are: bitrate, disc/ discnumber, length (expressed in seconds), playcount, rating, samplerate, score, size/ filesize (expressed in bytes, kbytes, and megabytes as specified in the unit for the filesize keyword), track (i. e. the track number), and year.
