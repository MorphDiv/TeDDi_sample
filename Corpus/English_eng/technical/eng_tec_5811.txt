Keyboard Commands
Commands
Keyboard
Keyboard Usage
In this chapter you will learn how to use the keyboard effectively, because most operations can be done more quickly by keyboard than with the mouse. It will take some time to learn the Key-Bindings, but mastering them saves you a lot of time. Please note that & krusader; can use Key-binding Profiles to swap easily to other Key-binding setups, e. g. of other commanders, or you can create your own key-bindings.
After starting & krusader;, the keyboard action can begin. Use Ctrl; L to jump to the Location Toolbar where you can type the desired directory. After Ctrl; Down arrow you are in the Terminal emulator and you can type any command you desire. Use Ctrl; Up arrow to jump back to the active panel. If you want to jump to a file or directory that starts with "f", then simply press "f" on the keyboard to use the Quick search. Use the Enter key to execute the file or to open a directory that has the focus. Be sure to remember the Function Keys - F3 to View, F4 to Edit, F5 to Copy, Alt; U to Unpack, etc.
You can also perform several operations with the Folder tabs, including several selection operations. And at the end you can close & krusader; with F10.
Key-Bindings
Key-Bindings
Most of the key-bindings (shortcuts) are configurable in the Settings Configure Shortcuts menu, if you like to use other key-bindings then the default ones. You can even configure more actions to a Key-Binding (for the actions that do n't have a key-binding set by default). Please note that some key-bindings are not & krusader; key-bindings (e. g. & kde; key-bindings). The key-bindings that & krusader; uses by default are listed below.
