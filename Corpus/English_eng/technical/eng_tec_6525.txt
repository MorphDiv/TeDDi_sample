PowerDevil Configuration
A configurator for PowerDevil
(c), 2008 Dario Freddi
From this module, you can configure the Daemon, create and edit powersaving profiles, and see your system's capabilities.
PowerDevil configuration This module lets you configure PowerDevil. PowerDevil is a daemon (so it runs in background) that is started upon KDE startup. PowerDevil has 2 levels of configuration: a general one, that is always applied, and a profile-based one, that lets you configure a specific behavior in every situation. You can also have a look at your system capabilities in the last tab. To get you started, first configure the options in the first 2 tabs. Then switch to the fourth one, and create/ edit your profiles. Last but not least, assign your profiles in the third Tab. You do not have to restart PowerDevil, just click "Apply", and you are done.
Another power manager has been detected. PowerDevil will not start if other power managers are active. If you want to use PowerDevil as your primary power manager, please remove the existing one and restart the PowerDevil service.
It seems powersaved is running on this system. PowerDevil will not start if other power managers are active. If you want to use PowerDevil as your primary power manager, please stop powersaved and restart the PowerDevil service.
PowerDevil seems not to be started. Either you have its service turned off, or there is a problem in D-Bus.
No methods found
No scaling methods were found. If your CPU is reasonably recent, this is probably because you have not loaded some kernel modules. Usually scaling modules have names similar to cpufreq_ondemand. Scaling is useful and can save a lot of battery. Click on "Attempt Loading Modules" to let PowerDevil try to load the required modules. If you are sure your PC does not support scaling, you can also disable this warning by clicking "Do not display this warning again".

Do not display this warning again
ConsoleKit was not found active on your PC, or PowerDevil cannot contact it. ConsoleKit lets PowerDevil detect whether the current session is active, which is useful if you have more than one user logged into your system at any one time.
No issues found with your configuration.
No kernel modules for CPU scaling were found. Either you do not have them installed, or PowerDevil could not detect them.

Battery Actions
PowerDevil was compiled without Xss and Xext support, or the XSync extension is not available. Determining idle time will not be possible. Please consider recompiling PowerDevil with at least one of these two libraries.
PowerDevil was compiled without Xext support, or the XSync extension is not available. XSync grants extra efficiency and performance, saving your battery and CPU. It is advised to use PowerDevil with XSync enabled.
XSync does not seem to be your preferred query backend, though it is available on your system. Using it largely improves performance and efficiency, and is strongly advised. Click on the button below to enable it now.
Enable XSync Backend
Support for the XSync extension
XSync is an extension that allows high efficiency query of the system. If it is available, PowerDevil will be much more reliable and efficient
XSync Support
Support for XScreensaver
Through XScreensaver, PowerDevil may query the system if XSync is not available. It is necessary only if your system does not support XSync. If both of them are unavailable, PowerDevil will not be able to query idle time of the system
XScreenSaver Support
Support for XTest extension
Through XTest, PowerDevil is able to fake user activity, preventing suspension loops. If it is not available, loops might occur
