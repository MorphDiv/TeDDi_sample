Number
is the binary number.
The number can have a maximum of 10 places (bits).
The most significant bit is the sign bit.
Negative numbers are entered as two's complement.
Places
is the number of places to be output.
Example:
=BIN2OCT(1100100; 4)
returns the text string
0144
.
DELTA function
recognising;equal numbers
mw added one entry
DELTA
The result is TRUE (1) if both numbers, which are delivered as an argument, are equal, otherwise it is FALSE (0).
Syntax:
DELTA(Number1; Number2)
Example:
=DELTA(1; 2)
returns 0.
DEC2BIN function
converting;decimal numbers, into binary numbers
mw added one entry

Syntax:
DEC2BIN(Number; Places)
Number
is the decimal number.
If
Number
is negative, the function returns a binary number with 10 characters.
The most significant bit is the sign bit, the other 9 bits return the value.
Places
is the number of places to be output.
Example:
=DEC2BIN(100; 8)
returns the text string
01100100
.

ERF function
Gaussian error integral
mw added one entr
ERF
Returns values of the Gaussian error integral.
Syntax:
ERF(LowerLimit; UpperLimit)
LowerLimit
is the lower limit of the integral.
UpperLimit
(optional) is the upper limit of the integral.
If this parameter is omitted, the calculation takes places between 0 and the lower limit.
