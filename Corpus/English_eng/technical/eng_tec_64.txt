Defining a Database Range
You can define a range of cells in a spreadsheet to use as a database.
Each row in this database range corresponds to a database record and each cell in a row corresponds to a database field.
You can sort, group, search, and perform calculations on the range as you would in a database.
You can only edit and access a database range in the spreadsheet that contains the range.
You cannot access the database range in the %PRODUCTNAME Data Sources view.
