Systemsettings
Notifications
The system bell or beep is a feature of the X server, which attempts to make good use of the available hardware.
& kde; normally does not use the system bell; instead using its own system notifications, which could include log entries, message popups, or its own beep. You can configure these in the System Notifications & systemsettings; module.
It is not always possible for the X server to actually make a beep sound with exactly the parameters selected due to hardware limitations. For example, on most PCs, volume control is not very good so the X server seems to fake low volume with a reduced duration of the sound. Thus, if the settings do not seem to do anything, this is because the X server and/ or the hardware do not support anything better.
Select Use system bell instead of system notification then you are able to set the following parameters for the bell:
Volume (percentage of maximum volume)
Here you can customize the volume of the system bell. For further customization of the bell, see the Accessibility & systemsettings; module.
Pitch (in Hz)
Here you can customize the pitch of the system bell. For further customization of the bell, see the Accessibility & systemsettings; module.
Duration (in milliseconds)
Here you can customize the duration of the system bell. For further customization of the bell, see the Accessibility & systemsettings; module.
You can use the Test button to hear how the current settings will sound.
