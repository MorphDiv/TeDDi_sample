This device will be automatically mounted at login.
This device will not be automatically mounted at login.
This device will be automatically mounted when attached.
This device will not be automatically mounted when attached.
Attached Devices
Disconnected Devices
When this is unchecked, no device automounting of any kind will happen, regardless of anything selected in the "Device Overrides" section.
Enable automatic mounting of removable media
When this is checked, KDE will only automatically mount devices it remembers. A device is'remembered 'if it has ever been mounted before. e. g. plugging in a USB media player to charge. If the files are not accessed, KDE will not automatically mount the player next time it is seen. Once they have been accessed, however, KDE will remember to automatically make the contents accessible to your system.
Only automatically mount removable media that has been manually mounted before
If any removable storage devices are connected to your system when you login to your desktop, KDE will automatically make the contents available to your system for other programs to read.
Mount all removable media at login
When this is checked, KDE will automatically make the contents of any storage device available to the system when it is plugged in or attached.
Automatically mount removable media when attached
Device Overrides
This list contains the storage devices known to KDE. If "Automount on Login" is checked, the device will be automatically mounted even though "Mount all removable media at login" is unchecked. The same applies for "Automount on Attach". If "Enable automatic mounting of removable media" is unchecked, the overrides do not apply and no devices will be automatically mounted.
Clicking this button causes KDE to'forget 'that the selected devices ever existed. This is only useful if "Only automatically mount removable media that has been manually mounted before" is checked. Once a device is forgotten and KDE is set to only automatically mount familiar devices, the device will not be automatically mounted.
