This section contains notes and hints specific to Xitami.
This list describes how to set up the PHP CGI binary to work with Xitami on Windows.
Important for CGI users:
Read the faq on cgi.force_redirect for important details.
This directive needs to be set to 0.
Make sure the webserver is running, and point your browser to xitamis admin console (usually http: / /127.0.0.1 / admin), and click on Configuration.
Navigate to the Filters, and put the extension which PHP should parse (i.e. .php) into the field File extensions (.xxx).
In Filter command or script put the path and name of your php executable i.e. c:\php\php.exe.
Press the 'Save' icon.
Restart the server to reflect changes.
