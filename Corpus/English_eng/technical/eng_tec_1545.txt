The accepted range is from 1-12.

as a string that contains the date, the
DateSerial function
evaluates each of the parameters (year, month, day) as separate numerical expressions.

Sub ExampleDateSerial
Dim lDate as Long
Dim sDate as String
lDate = DateSerial(1964, 4, 9)
sDate = DateSerial(1964, 4, 9)
msgbox lDate REM returns 23476
msgbox sDate REM returns 09/04/1964
