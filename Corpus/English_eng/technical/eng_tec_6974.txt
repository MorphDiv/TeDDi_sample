Overview
Example for the
Original image

This filter makes your image look like a slide, by adding a slide-film like black frame, sprocket holes, and labels.
If necessary, the image will be cropped to fit into an aspect ratio of width : height = 3:2. If image width is greater than image height, black frames will be added at the top and the bottom of the image, else the frames will be added on the left and right sides. You may select the color as well as the font of the text appearing on the frames. The current background color will be used for drawing the holes.
The script only works on RGB and grayscale images that contain one layer. Otherwise the menu entry is insensitive and grayed out.
Activate the filter
The filter is found in the image window menu under
Options

Round Corners
Example for the

This filter rounds the corners of an image, optionally adding a drop-shadow and a background layer.
The filter works on RGB and grayscale images that contain only one layer. It creates a copy of the image or can optionally work on the original. It uses the current background color to create a background layer.
This filter is found in the image window menu under

Edge radius
Rounding corners is done by selecting a quarter of a circle at every corner and removing the area not covered by this selection. The
In the examples below, the filter was applied to a 100x100 pixels image, with varying edge radius. For radius = 50, the four quadrants just form a circle with diameter = 100, which exactly fits into the original image outline. A radius greater than 50 is possible, but look what happens...
Edge radius examples
A 100x100 pixels image, edge radius: 15 (default).
Edge radius: 35.
Edge radius: 50.
Edge radius: 65. Ouch!
Add drop-shadow
When this option is checked, the filter will cast a shadow behind your image after rounding the image corners.
Shadow X/Y offset
X and Y offset determine where the shadow will be placed in relation to the image. Offset is measured in pixels. High values make the shadow look like it's far away, and low values will make it look closer to the image.
Shadow offset examples
Shadow X offset: 8, Y offset: 8 (default).
Shadow X offset: 16, Y offset: 4.
Note that the shadow offsets as well as the blur radius are limited to background area.

Add background
When you check this option (it is checked by default), the filter will add a background layer below the existing layer, filled with the current background color. The size of this new layer depends on the blur radius and the shadow offsets.

Introduction
These filters are image-dependent Script-Fu scripts. They create decorative borders, and some of them add some nice special effects to the image.

Fuzzy Border
Example for the

This filter adds a cool fading border to an image. The border will look jagged and fuzzy, and you can specify color and thickness of the fading border. Optionally you may add a shadow to the image.
You can find this filter in the image window menu through

Color
Clicking on this button brings up the color selector dialog that allows you to choose the border color.
Here you can set the thickness of the fuzzy border, in pixels. Maximum is 300 pixels, regardless of the image width or height.
Blur border
If checked, the border will be blurred. The example below shows the effect of blurring:




Granularity
The border's granularity is almost the size of pixel blocks spread to create the effect of a jagged and fuzzy border.

This filter adds realistic looking coffee stains to the image.
Every stain is created in a layer of its own. The stain layers are randomly moved to let the stains spread out (at the end you may see the boundary of the moved top layer).

Delta value on color
See
This option makes the border sides to be colored in different shades and thus makes the image to appear raised. The actual color of the respective border side is computed for every color component red, green, and blue
Top shade = Border color + Delta
Right shade = Border color - &frac12; Delta
Bottom shade = Border color - Delta
Left shade = Border color + &frac12; Delta
Delta examples

Example: the default color is blue (38,31,207), default delta is 25. So the shades of the borders are: top: (38,31,207) + (25,25,25) = (63,56,232), right: (38,31,207) + (-13,-13,-13) = (25,18,194), etc.
