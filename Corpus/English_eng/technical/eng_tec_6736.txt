We have detected a Blogspot. com site. Blogspot uses GData API nowadays and you still cannot upload files to Blogspot. com itself. This means that you cannot use the media management to upload files.
We have detected your Wordpress. com site.
We have detected your LiveJournal. com site.
We have detected your personal Drupal installation.
We have detected your personal Wordpress installation.
For autoconfigure to work correctly you need to insert the URL to your blog's homepage and not the XML-RPC gateway. Otherwise, this is your personal undetectable XML-RPC installation. We assume Blogger API 1.0 for now. If you are confident that your server supports more than that, choose Wordpress as type.
