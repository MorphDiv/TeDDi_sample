AC Adapter Unplugged
GNOME Power Manager Notification when AC adapter is removed
You can disable this notification by changing the GConf key
Fully Charged
GNOME Power Manager Notification when laptop primary battery is fully charged
You can disable this notification by changing the GConf key
You will only get a repeat notification if your battery percentage charge drops below 95% and then is again fully charged. This prevents some machines from showing unwanted repeat notifications if the battery is incorrectly reporting the charged status.
Power Low
When the battery is low, you will receive the following notification. You should consider switching to AC power really soon.

You can disable this notification by changing the GConf key
Power Critical
When the computer has run out of power, it will show this notification explaining what action is required. You can change the critical low action using the preferences tool.
GNOME Power Manager Notification when the system power is critically low
Suspend Failure
When a suspend failure occurs you may get this following warning. The most common reason for this notification is that the current user does not have permission to suspend or hibernate the computer.

You can disable this notification by changing the GConf key
Statistics
The statistics program allows you to visualize the power consumption of your laptop hardware.
This has been removed from the information window of previous versions of GNOME Power Manager as the data interface is now using DBUS rather than internal IPC. This allows other applications to query and display the data if required.
Power History going from battery power to AC
You may not see some options or graphs if your computer does not have the required hardware. You may also see other hardware not shown here (for example UPS devices) but these are treated the same way as other devices.
Charge History
This graph shows the percentage charge available for the composite primary battery, so if you have a main laptop battery and an auxiliary battery then only the averaged value will be shown. A legend is not shown with this graph.
Power History
This graph shows the power history charge used by the composite primary battery. This line represents the amount of power that is either being used to charge the batteries in the system, or the power being used by the system from the batteries. You should see the line go up when processor intensive tasks are performed, and down when the system is at idle, or when the screen is dimmed. A legend is shown with this graph when data events have been received.
You do will not receive rate data from your computer if it is not charging or discharging, or if the computer is suspended. This is due to hardware limitations where the rate is only sent from the battery management chip, rather than the power management chip on the motherboard.
Estimated Time History
This graph shows the estimated charge history for the composite primary battery. This line represents the amount of time required until charged, or the amount of time until discharge. This line should go proportionally up when the rate decreases and down when the rate increases. A legend is shown with this graph when data events have been received.
Preferences
The preferences window allows you to control:
The LCD brightness when on AC and battery power
The idle time for the screen power-down and suspend action
The actions to perform when the laptop lid is closed
The notification area icon policy
Some sliders or option boxes may be disabled if the GConf policy keys are not writable. This allows administrators to lock-down the actions that a user can select.
AC Preferences
GNOME Power Manager AC tab
Battery Preferences

Screen Locking
By default,
There is a complex locking scheme available for power users that allows locking policy to change for the lid, suspend and hibernate actions. To enable this complex mode, you will have to disable the GConf key:
/apps/gnome-power-manager/lock/use_screensaver_settings
Then the policy keys can be set to force a gnome-screensaver lock and unlock when the action is performed:
/apps/gnome-power-manager/lock/blank_screen
/apps/gnome-power-manager/lock/suspend
/apps/gnome-power-manager/lock/hibernate
The lock policy for gnome-screensaver is ignored until the simple mode is re-enabled.
GNOME Power Applets
Brightness Applet
The brightness applet allows the user to change the brightness temporarily without changing the default policy. This may be useful if you have got a laptop without brightness buttons, as you can now change the brightness easily.
Brightness applet drop-down.
You will not get the slider if your hardware is not supported.
Inhibit Applet
The inhibit applet allows the user to prevent the computer auto-sleeping when inactive. This may be required with old or proprietary programs such as VMWare or Matlab. Just click the icon for the auto-suspend to be inhibited, and click it again for normal operation.
Inhibit applet in inhibited state.
Don't use this applet if you just use GNOME software, instead file a bug to make the application use the Inhibit() and UnInhibit() methods as this should 'just work'.
Frequently Asked Questions
These are questions the mailing list gets asked frequently.
What is battery capacity?
Capacity is how much charge your battery can store compared to its manufacturer's guidelines.
This graph shows the capacity of a typical lithium ion battery over a few hundred charge-discharge cycles.
What's the difference between suspend and hibernate?
The Suspend state is a power saving feature which is the lowest level of power consumption that preserves program data in the computer's memory. When your computer is in the Suspended state, computation will not be performed until normal activity is resumed. It will not resume until signaled by an external event such as a keyboard button press. It generally takes a few seconds to suspend and then resume your computer.
You still use a small amount of battery power while suspended, so is not recommended for the low power action. If you remove AC power on a desktop, or run out of battery power on a laptop then you will lose your work.
The Hibernation state saves the complete state of the computer to hard disk and turns off the power, so that the computer appears to be off. It will not resume until signaled by an external event such as a keyboard button press. This is the lowest power sleeping state available. If you remove AC power on a desktop, or run out of battery power on a laptop then work will not be lost. It can take up to a minute or more to hibernate and wake your computer.
My monitor is broken and treats DPMS standby and off states as 'no-signal' which leaves the monitor powered on.
You have to change the DPMS suspend mode
My time to discharge is always incorrect due to a faulty battery, what can I do?
You might be able to use the percentage charge for g-p-m to use as the policy data. Open
This should get the policy actions working for you, but of course the time remaining will still be incorrect.
How do I make my application stop the computer auto-suspending?
If your application is doing a long operation, you might want to disable the ability to suspend for a little while. You should use gnome-session if you really don't want the user to be able to suspend, or for the computer to save power by hibernating or suspending.
I'm running ACPI. Why do events (such as removing the AC adapter) take so long to register?
One of two things might be the problem.
HAL might not be running the addon that captures the ACPI event.
You BIOS could be faulty, and might need a work-around. Please send a bug report.
For the first case, try to find the HAL processes that are running:
And check for the process

I've set the computer inactive timeout to one minute and it still takes longer than that to suspend.
gnome-screensaver is a session daemon that monitors user input, and if the mouse has not been moved, or the keyboard been pressed then it starts a timeout. When the value of this timeout reaches the value set in gnome-screensaver-preferences, then the login is marked as 'session idle'. This is when

Why does my lid state get confused after suspending or hibernating? (and) My laptop suspended when I didn't expect it to when I removed the power cord!
When you suspend and then resume, ACPI does not seem to send the "lid open" event like it should, which I presume is because userspace is not in a position to handle the kernel event when we start to thaw userspace processes.
What we have to do it manually refresh the lid device using HAL when we resume, so that the new "lid open" value is propagated to
You need to update to a newer version of HAL, or use your updated distribution bug-fix packages.
Does
It supports whatever backends HAL supports! At the moment this includes:
APM (Pre-2000 Intel computers)
ACPI (most modern Intel compatible computers)
PMU (Powerbook, and iBook PPC computers)
Why does
Before showing items such as "Suspend" and "Hibernate" in the menu g-p-m checks two things:
If HAL can detect a sleep handler in the kernel. You can test this doing
If your administrator (or you!) has disabled the ability to do a certain action. You can test this using
For instance, my PowerBook reports from HAL that it can suspend and hibernate, but because I know my hibernate does not work, I can disable it in
If HAL does not list the options you want, then maybe you need to check your BIOS to check that it's running in the correct mode, and also that you have compiled your kernel with the correct options.
If there are no gconf keys returned by the second check above, you need to reinstall your gconf schema as per gnomebug:341256: (as root):
export GCONF_CONFIG_SOURCE=`gconftool-2 --get-default-source`
gconftool-2 --makefile-install-rule data/gnome-power-manager.schemas
killall -HUP gconfd-2
Why does my screen dim or screensaver start even when I'm clicking the mouse?
If you click the mouse, or scroll the scroll-wheel without moving the pointer, then gnome-screensaver will detect the session as being idle. This is a limitation of X.org, but is worked around in newer versions of gnome-screensaver.

If you call the inhibit methods on gnome-screensaver, then gnome-screensaver will not mark your session as idle. This means that the screen will not dim, the screensaver will not start and the computer will not suspend automatically.
While playing a movie full-screen, totem should use the gnome-screensaver inhibit methods. The idea is that totem does not have to worry at all about power management. The only thing it wants to assert is that even though there are no key presses or mouse movements, the session is still being used.
The only applications that should use the

After numerous debates, the consensus was that is was not a good idea to add this functionality to HAL. It was decided user-configurable power management was not really required when modern hard disks have really intelligent power management.
Here the power consumption data for a typical notebook hard disk (IDE/SATA):
Startup (peak, max.) 5.5W NC
Seek 2.3W 2.7W
Read (avg.) 2.0W 2.3W
Write (avg.) 2.0W 2.3W
Active idle (avg.) 1.1W 1.2W
Low power idle (avg.) 0.85W 0.9W
Standby (avg.) 0.2W 0.25W
Sleep 0.1W NC
The conclusions you can take from this are:
A disk on low power idle mode needs less than 1 Watt. For a normal battery with 50Wh you could run the hard disk for over 50 hours.
If you do not read/write from/to the hard disk the disk regulates power, but never shuts down the device. The reason is easy: you lost more power with each startup than to leave the hard disk online somewhere between 'Active idle' and 'Low power idle' (depends on the model/manufacturer).
The other reason to leave this to the internal power management of the disk is: the time needed to reactivate the device. You lose more performance than you lose power between 'Active idle' and 'Low power idle'.
If you use a journaling file system you normally need to flush periodically. This could run in a race between shut down device and restart device by system to flush. This means more power consumption as you change nothing.
You can't set power management for external USB hard disks, because you can't send the needed commands over the USB link to the disk.
How do I query or do actions on
You can use the dbus-send program. For example, you can set the DPMS mode by running the following:
dbus-send --session \\
 --dest=org.freedesktop.PowerManagement \\
 --type=method_call \\
 --print-reply \\
 --reply-timeout=2000 \\
 /org/freedesktop/PowerManagement \\
 org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.SetDpmsMode \\
 string:suspend
You can put the system into hibernation using the following:
dbus-send --session \\
 --dest=org.freedesktop.PowerManagement \\
 --type=method_call \\
 --print-reply \\
 --reply-timeout=2000 \\
 /org/freedesktop/PowerManagement \\
 org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Hibernate
See the developers guide file in CVS for the full list.
Nothing happens when I click suspend or hibernate!
HAL might not *yet* support your distro, or you might have found a bug in
Why does not my video adaptor come back after a suspend? It just displays black!
You may need to add a s3 command to your kernel boot string so that the kernel can re-initialize your video card. See
Using the new pm-utils should make all this stuff just work in the future using HAL fdi matching against machine DMI and video card vendor and product IDs.
Modern computers allow the speed of the processor to be reduced to save power. This allows a powerful computer to reduce the power usage when idle, or when the full capabilities are not required. This dramatically increases battery life as the processor is not running continuously at 100%.
All Pentium 4 - Ms
Pentium III Ms 600MHz to 1GHz
Pentium III Ms 700+ MHz
Not all processors support speed control, and you will not see the options to select a policy if your computer does not have a compatible processor installed. The following processors are known to support frequency scaling:
There are several ways to control the power consumption of the processor. You can have profiles, for example, to select maximum performance on AC power and maximum power saving on battery power. The easiest way to control the power saving is set the policy to "Automatic" as this will adjust the speed of the processor to the current state of the system automatically.
Maximum power saving: This sets the computer operating speed always to the lowest available setting to save battery power. (Linux kernel name:
Always maximum speed: This governor sets the processor operating speed to the highest available. (Linux kernel name:
Automatic power saving: This option changes the frequency of the processor in relation to current processor load. If the processor is being used, then the frequency will increase, but if it is not then will slowly reduce. This provides a nice middle ground between power saving and application speed. This option will keep the processor at high frequency for a few seconds after recent processor activity. This governor may not work correctly on older notebook computers. (Linux kernel name:
Based on processor load: This driver is a dynamic processor frequency policy. It will change the frequency of the processor in direct relation to processor load. Due to the number of frequency changes, this may not work reliably for older notebook computers. (Linux kernel name:
You may not have all the options listed below:
Some policies (ondemand and conservative) only increase the processor frequency from minimum when a process has a positive nice value even though a load greater than 1 occurs. This means user applications work well as the processor speed automatically increases. This can however result in a significant performance reduction for system daemons and some background session services. To rectify this, use another policy (e.g. Always maximum speed) or set the following GConf key:
