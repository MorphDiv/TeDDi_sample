Solaris mode for CPU percentage
If TRUE, system-monitor operates in 'Solaris mode' where a task's cpu usage is divided by the total number of CPUs. Else it operates in 'Irix mode'.

Whether information about all filesystems should be displayed
Whether to display information about all filesystems (including types like 'autofs' and 'procfs'). Useful for getting a list of all currently mounted filesystems.

Kill the selected process?
Killing a process may destroy data, break the session or introduce a security risk. Only unresponding processes should be killed.
End the selected process?
Ending a process may destroy data, break the session or introduce a security risk. Only unresponding processes should be ended.
