Conditional Formatting
/text/scalc/01/05120000.xhp
Conditional Formatting
Conditional Formatting
to define format styles depending on certain conditions.
If a style was already assigned to a cell, it remains unchanged.
The style entered here is then evaluated.
You can enter three conditions that query the content of cell values or formulae.
The conditions are evaluated from 1 to 3.
If the condition 1 matches the condition, the defined style will be used.
Otherwise, condition 2 is evaluated, and its defined style used.
If this style does not match, condition 3 is evaluated.
To apply conditional formatting, AutoCalculate must be enabled.
Choose Tools - Cell Contents - AutoCalculate (a check mark is present next to the command when AutoCalculate is enabled).

Condition 1/2/3
Mark the boxes corresponding to each condition and enter the corresponding condition.
To close the dialogue box, click
OK
.
Cell Value / Formula
Specifies if conditional formatting is dependent on a cell value or a formula.
If you select a formula as a reference, the
Cell Value Condition
box is displayed to the right of the
Cell value/Formula
field.
If the condition is &quot; Formula is &quot; , enter a cell reference.
If the cell reference is a value other than zero, the condition matches.
Cell Value Condition
Choose a condition for the format to be applied to the selected cells.
Cell Style
Choose the style to be applied if the specified condition matches.
New Style
If you haven't already defined a style to be used, you can click New Style to open the Organiser tab page of the Cell Style dialogue box.
Define a new style there and click OK.
Parameter field
Enter a reference, value or formula.
Enter a reference, value or formula in the parameter field, or in both parameter fields if you have selected a condition that requires two parameters.
You can also enter formulae containing relative references.
Once the parameters have been defined, the condition is complete.
It may appear as:
Cell value is equal 0:
Cell style Null value (You must have already defined a cell style with this name before assigning it to a condition).
Cell value is between $B$20 and $B$21:
Cell style Result (The corresponding value limits must already exist in cells B20 and B21)
Formula is SUM($A$1:$A$5)=10:
Cell style Result (The selected cells are formatted with the Result style if the sum of the contents in cells A1 to A5 is equal to 10.
