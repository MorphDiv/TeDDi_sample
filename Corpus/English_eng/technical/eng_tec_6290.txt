Search Transactions
General
The Search Transactions dialog searches your data based on criteria that you specify. You can access the dialog by going to the Edit menu and selecting Find transactions....
There are two main tabs in this dialog. The Criteria tab displays a number of sub-tabs for specifying the search critera.
The results will be displayed under the Result tab after the search has completed. Below the list of results, & kappname; shows the number of transactions that met the search criteria. Double-clicking on an individual transaction in the result list will bring up the appropriate ledger and display the transaction.
When the Find button is pressed, the search is initiated and all criteria that have been entered on any tab will be taken into account.
The Reset button resets all of the fields on all of the critera sub-tabs back to the defaults. This allows you to specify new search criteria.
The Close button closes the Search Transactions dialog box.
Search Criteria
There are several sub-tabs under the main Criteria tab, each of which allows you to specify different types of search criteria. Below the area for specifying the criteria, & kappname; lists each of the different types of criteria that are currently specified for the search.
Text
Search transactions Dialog, Text tab
This tab allows you to speicify text to search for. There are also two check boxes that control how the text is used in the search.
By default, this will match on simple substrings. For example:
Best will find Best Cakes, Inc.
est will also find Best Cakes, Inc.
In the dropdown field next to the text field, select Contains if you want to find transactions that contain the text, or select Does not contain if you want to find transactions that do not contain the specified text.
If you check the Case Sensitive box, the search will be case sensitive. For example, best would not find Best Cakes, Inc. if this option is set.
If you check the Treat Text as regular expression box, the text will be treated as a regular expresssion. For details on how to craft a regular expression, visit the & Qt; documentation about the QRegExp class.
