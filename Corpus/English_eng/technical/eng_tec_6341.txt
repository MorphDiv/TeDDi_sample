KDE Service Manager

Service Manager This module allows you to have an overview of all plugins of the KDE Daemon, also referred to as KDE Services. Generally, there are two types of service: Services invoked at startup Services called on demand The latter are only listed for convenience. The startup services can be started and stopped. In Administrator mode, you can also define whether services should be loaded at startup. Use this with care: some services are vital for KDE; do not deactivate services if you do not know what you are doing.
