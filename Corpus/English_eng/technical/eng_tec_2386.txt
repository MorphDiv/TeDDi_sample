(PHP 3, PHP 4)
This function sorts an array such that array indices maintain their correlation with the array elements they are associated with.
This is used mainly when sorting associative arrays where the actual element order is significant.
Example 1. asort() example
$fruits = array ("d"= "lemon", "a"= "orange", "b"= "banana", "c"= "apple"); asort ($fruits); reset ($fruits); while (list ($key, $val) = each ($fruits)) {echo "$key = $val\n";}
This example would display:
c = apple b = banana d = lemon a = orange
The fruits have been sorted in alphabetical order, and the index associated with each element has been maintained.
You may modify the behavior of the sort using the optional parameter sort_flags, for details see sort().
See also arsort(), rsort(), ksort(), and sort().
