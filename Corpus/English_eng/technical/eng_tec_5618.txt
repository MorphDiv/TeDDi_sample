& Graphics mode on text console:
You can select the graphics mode for this kernel here. If you intend to use a VGA graphics mode, you must compile the kernel with support for framebuffer devices. The ask setting brings up a prompt at boot time.

Mount root filesystem & read-only
Mount the root filesystem for this kernel read-only. Since the init scripts normally take care of remounting the root filesystem in read-write mode after running some checks, this should always be turned on. Do not turn this off unless you know what you are doing.
Do not check & partition table
This turns off some sanity checks while writing the configuration. This should not be used under "normal" circumstances, but it can be useful, for example, by providing the capability of booting from a floppy disk, without having a floppy in the drive every time you run lilo. This sets the unsafe keyword in lilo. conf.
& Record boot command lines for defaults
Checking this box enables automatic recording of boot command lines as the default for the following bootups. This way, lilo "locks" on a choice until it is manually overridden. This sets the lock option in lilo. conf
Restrict parameters
If this box is checked, a password (entered below) is required only if any parameters are changed (i. e. the user can boot linux, but not linux single or linux init=/ bin/ sh). This sets the restricted option in lilo. conf.
Require & password:
Enter the password required for bootup (if any) here. If restricted above is checked, the password is required for additional parameters only. WARNING: The password is stored in clear text in / etc/ lilo. conf. Make sure that nobody untrusted can read this file. Also, you probably do not want to use your normal/ root password here.

LILO Configuration
(c) 2000, Bernhard Rosenkraenzer
Bernhard "Bero" Rosenkraenzer
Select...
You can edit the lilo. conf file directly here. All changes you make here are automatically transferred to the graphical interface.
Install & boot record to drive/ partition:
Select the drive or partition you want to install the LILO boot loader to here. Unless you intend to use other boot managers in addition to LILO, this should be the MBR (master boot record) of your boot drive. In this case, you should probably select / dev/ hda if your boot drive is an IDE drive or / dev/ sda if your boot drive is SCSI.
Boot the default kernel/ OS & after:
/ 10 seconds
LILO will wait the amount of time specified here before booting the kernel (or OS) marked as default in the Images tab.
Use & linear mode
Check this box if you want to use the linear mode. Linear mode tells the boot loader the location of kernels in linear addressing rather than sector/ head/ cylinder. Linear mode is required for some SCSI drives, and should not cause problems unless you are planning to create a boot disk to be used with a different computer. See the lilo. conf man page for details.
Use & compact mode
Check this box if you want to use the compact mode. The compact mode tries to merge read requests for adjacent sectors into a single read request. This reduces load time and keeps the boot map smaller, but will not work on all systems.
Checking this box enables automatic recording of boot command lines as the defaults for the following boots. This way, lilo "locks" on a choice until it is manually overridden. This sets the lock option in lilo. conf.
If this box is checked, a password (entered below) is required only if any parameters are changed (i. e. the user can boot linux, but not linux single or linux init=/ bin/ sh). This sets the restricted option in lilo. conf. This sets a default for all Linux kernels you want to boot. If you need a per-kernel setting, go to the Operating systems tab and select Details.
Enter the password required for bootup (if any) here. If restricted is checked above, the password is only required for additional parameters. WARNING: The password is stored in clear text in / etc/ lilo. conf. Make sure that nobody untrusted can read this file. Also, you probably do not want to use your normal/ root password here. This sets a default for all Linux kernels you want to boot. If you need a per-kernel setting, go to the Operating systems tab and select Details.
& Default graphics mode on text console:
You can select the default graphics mode here. If you intend to use a VGA graphics mode, you must compile the kernel with support for framebuffer devices. The ask setting brings up a prompt at boot time. This sets a default for all Linux kernels you want to boot. If you need a per-kernel setting, go to the Operating systems tab and select Details.
Enter LILO & prompt automatically
If this box is checked, LILO goes to the LILO prompt whether or not a key is pressed. If it is turned off, LILO boots the default operating system unless shift is pressed (in that case, it goes to the LILO prompt). This sets the prompt option in lilo. conf.
This is the list of kernels and operating systems you can currently boot. Select which one you want to edit here.
& Kernel:
Enter the filename of the kernel you want to boot here.
& Label:
Enter the label (name) of the kernel you want to boot here.
& Root filesystem:
Enter the root filesystem (i. e. the partition that will be mounted as / at boot time) for the kernel you want to boot here.
& Initial ramdisk:
If you want to use an initial ramdisk (initrd) for this kernel, enter its filename here. Leave this field blank if you do not intend to use an initial ramdisk for this kernel.
Extra parameters:
Enter any extra parameters you wish to pass to the kernel here. Usually, this can be left blank. This sets the append option in lilo. conf.
Set & Default
Boot this kernel/ OS if the user does not make a different choice
Details
This button brings up a dialog box with further, less commonly used, options.
& Probe
Automatically generate a (hopefully) reasonable lilo. conf for your system
& Check Configuration
Run LILO in test mode to see if the configuration is okay.

Add a new Linux kernel to the boot menu
Add Other & OS...
Add a non-Linux OS to the boot menu

& What's this?
The What's This? button is part of this program's help system. Click on the What's This button, then on any widget in the window to get information (like this) on it.
& Help
This button calls up the program's online help system. If it does nothing, no help file has been written (yet); in that case, use the What's This button on the left.
& Default
This button resets all parameters to some (hopefully sane) default values.
& Reset
This button resets all parameters to what they were before you started the program.
& Apply
This button saves all your changes without exiting.
