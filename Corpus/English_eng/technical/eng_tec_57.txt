Assigning Formats by Formula
The STYLE() function can be added to an existing formula in a cell.
For example, together with the CURRENT function, you can colour a cell depending on its value.
The formula =... + STYLE(IF(CURRENT() > 3; &quot; Red &quot; ; &quot; Green &quot; )) applies the cell style &quot; Red &quot; to cells if the value is greater than 3, otherwise the cell style &quot; Green &quot; is applied.
