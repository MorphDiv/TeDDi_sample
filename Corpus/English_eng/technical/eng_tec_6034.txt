Internet Shortcuts
gg:
Internet shortcuts are a really useful feature of & konqueror;: once you get used to them, you'll wonder how you ever lived without them.
To see what internet shortcuts are, open up & konqueror; and type gg: kde in the Location bar.
You will go to Google, searching for & kde;.
They are many such shortcuts like ggl: (Google I'm feeling lucky), bug: (bugs. kde. org) and so on.
To get a full list, click on Settings in the & konqueror; menu, and select Web Shortcuts. Here you will find a full list of all the shortcuts. You can create new ones, change existing ones, or delete unused shortcuts. You can also disable web shortcuts if you do n't like them. If you set the Default search engine, you do n't have to type the shortcut anymore. For instance if you set it to Google, you can just type kde in the Location bar, and it will search Google for kde;.
In Keyword delimiter you can choose if you want to separate a shortcut with a colon (gg: kde) or a space (gg kde).
A nice tip with Internet shortcuts is that you can use them from the Run Command dialog. Just open it (through the & kmenu; or with Alt; F2) and type your shortcut, & eg; gg: kde, and press & Enter;. It will automatically open & konqueror; with a Google search for & kde;.
