Creating a Formula
As with charts and images, formulae are created as objects within a document.
Inserting a formula into a document automatically starts $[officename] Math.
You can create, edit and format the formula using a large selection of predefined symbols and functions.

Insert - Object - Formula
.
The text will be converted into a formatted formula.
Formulae cannot be calculated in $[officename] Math because it is a formula editor (for writing and showing formulae) and not a calculation program.
Use spreadsheets to calculate formulae, or for simple calculations use the text document calculation function.
Creating a Formula in the Commands Window
Use the $[officename] Math Commands window to enter and edit formulae.
As you make entries in the Commands window, you will see the results in the document.
To maintain an overview when creating long and complicated formulae, use the Formula Cursor on the Tools bar.
When this function is activated, the cursor location within the Commands window is also shown in the text window.
Individual Symbols
You can create your own symbols and import characters from other fonts.
You can add new symbols to the basic catalogue of $[officename] Math symbols, or create your own special catalogues.
Numerous special characters are also available.
Formulae in Context
To make working with formulae easier, use the context menus, which can be called up with a right mouse-click.
This applies especially to the Commands window.
This context menu contains all the commands that are found in the Formula Elements window, and also operators, and so on, which can be inserted into your formula by mouse-click without having to key them into the Commands window.
