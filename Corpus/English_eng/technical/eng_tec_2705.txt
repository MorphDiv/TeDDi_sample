(PHP 4 = 4.2.0)
dio_open() opens a file and returns a new file descriptor for it, or FALSE if any error occurred.
If flags is O_CREAT, optional third parameter mode will set the mode of the file (creation permissions).
The flags parameter can be one of the following options:
O_RDONLY - opens the file for read access
O_WRONLY - opens the file for write access
O_RDWR - opens the file for both reading and writing
O_CREAT - creates the file, if it doesn 't already exist
O_EXCL - if both, O_CREAT and O_EXCL are set, dio_open() fails, if file already exists
O_TRUNC - if file exists, and its opened for write access, file will be truncated to zero length.
O_APPEND - write operations write data at the end of file
O_NONBLOCK - sets non blocking mode
