(PHP 4 = 4.0.1)
This function carries out networked (blocked) activity for outstanding requests which have been prepared by the functions yaz_connect(), yaz_search(), yaz_present(), yaz_scan() and yaz_itemorder(). yaz_wait() returns when all targets have either completed all requests or aborted (in case of errors).
If the options array is given that holds options that change the behaviour of yaz_wait().
Sets timeout in seconds.
If a target hasn' t responded within the timeout it is considered dead and yaz_wait() returns.
The default value for timeout is 15 seconds.
