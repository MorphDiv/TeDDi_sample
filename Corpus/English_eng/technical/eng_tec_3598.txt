Gathers the statistics of the file or symbolic link named by filename.
This function is identical to the stat() function except that if the filename parameter is a symbolic link, the status of the symbolic link is returned, not the status of the file pointed to by the symbolic link.
Returns an array with the statistics of the file with the following elements:
device
inode
inode protection mode
number of links
user id of owner
group id owner
device type if inode device *
size in bytes
time of last access
time of last modification
time of last change
blocksize for filesystem I / O *
number of blocks allocated
lstat() cannot be used on remote files.
The results of this function are cached.
See clearstatcache() for more details.
