Date and Time Functions
Use the statements and functions described here to perform date and time calculations.
%PRODUCTNAME
Basic lets you calculate time or date differences by converting the time and date values to continuous numerical values.
After the difference is calculated, special functions are used to reconvert the values to the standard time or date formats.
%PRODUCTNAME
Basic also supports the variable type Date, which can contain a time specification consisting of both a date and time.
