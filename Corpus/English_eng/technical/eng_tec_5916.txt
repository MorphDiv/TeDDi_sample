fixincludes
1
Reduce the number of #includes in & kde; source files
fixincludes -v, --verbose -e, --experimental -m, --modify file --help
Description
fixincludes tries to reduce the number of #includes in C++ source files. Much of it's processing is specific to & kde; sources and so it might not work so well with sources for non-kde; applications.
The following problems are identified by fixincludes:
Including headers that are no longer supported but which exist for compatibility with older Qt/ KDE versions;
Including the same file multiple times.
There is also an experimental mode which tries removing each #include one at a time (with a few exceptions) to see whether the source still compiles. Note that this experimental mode will modify the original sources.
By default the sources will not be modified; the identified problems will simply be written to standard output.
The list of C++ sources to examine should be given on the command-line. If no files are given, all C++ sources in or beneath the current directory will be examined (with the exception of directories whose Makefile. am contains -UQT_NO_COMPAT or -UKDE_NO_COMPAT)
This utility is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.
Options
-v, --verbose
Verbose mode. Additional debugging output is written to standard output.
-e, --experimental
Experimental mode, as described above in detail. Note that this option implies --modify.
-m, --modify
As well as writing messages to standard output, actually modify the original sources to fix any problems that were found.
