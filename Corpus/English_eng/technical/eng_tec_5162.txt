(PHP 4 = 4.0.1)
Returns error for target (last request).
The error code is either a Z39.50 diagnostic code (usually a Bib-1 diagnostic) or a client side error code which is generated by PHP / YAZ itself, such as "Connect failed", "Init Rejected ", etc.
yaz_errno() should be called after network activity for each target - (after yaz_wait() returns) to determine the success or failure of the last operation (e.g. search).
To get a text description of the error, call yaz_error().
