The File Manager
& kde; 's file manager is & konqueror;. The & konqueror; home page is located at http: / /www. konqueror. org where a & konqueror; specific FAQ can be found.
How can I change the appearance of a folder in & konqueror;?
Right-click the folder, select Properties, click on the large icon in the dialog which appears, and choose another icon.
To change the icon displayed for entries in the K Menu, use the Menu Editor, accessed by clicking with the & RMB; on the & kmenu; icon and selecting Menu Editor from the menu.
How can I do non-anonymous & FTP; transfers with & konqueror;?
Normally, if you enter a & URL; like ftp: / / ftp. example. com, & konqueror; will attempt an anonymous login to the & FTP; server. If you want to login as a particular user, enter a & URL; like ftp: / / username@ftp. example. com instead. & konqueror; will ask for your password and connect to the server.
How do I specify the startup folder for & konqueror;?
Using the & RMB;, click on the Home icon and choose Properties. Under the Application tab you will probably find something like kfmclient openProfile filemanagement; just append file: / whereever/ you/ want with the folder you would like & konqueror; to start in.
How do I rename files?
Simply right click on the file and select Rename or press the keyboard shortcut F2 with a file selected.
Where did the delete entry from my right-click context menu go?
In & kde; 3.4 the delete context menu entries that bypass the trashcan are no longer displayed by default. To enable them, go to Settings Configure & konqueror; and select Behaviour in the iconbar to the left. Tick the checkbox Show'Delete 'context menu entries which bypass the trashcan.
How do I configure the programs that & konqueror; uses to open different types of files?
In order to configure file associations, you should go to the & kcontrolcenter; and choose the item File Associations under the category KDE Components.
Suppose the default PDF viewer is now & kghostview; and you would prefer to use KPDF as a viewer. You would simply type pdf in the search box at the top of the dialog, choose pdf in the application group and move KPDF up. In the Embedding tab you can also choose which component other applications will use to display files (for example, when viewing files in & konqueror; or using & ark; 's embedded viewer).
How can I configure & konqueror; to open files with double-click instead of single-click?
In the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Peripherals Mouse and in the General tab, select Double-click to open files and folders.
When I try to click on a folder in & konqueror;, I get the message: There appears to be a configuration error. You have associated Konqueror with inode/ directory, but it cannot handle this file type.
You need to make sure that the embedding settings for inode/ directory are correct:
In & konqueror;, go to Settings Configure Konqueror and then to the File Associations page.
Open inode- > directory in the tree view.
Click on the Embedding tab. Make sure that Left Click Action is set to Show file in embedded viewer, and by default Icon View (konq_iconview) is at the top of Services Preference Order.
What are %i and %m in the Execute line?
They are used by all & kde; applications (since they are implemented in KApplication and all good & kde; programs create a KApplication object before they even look at the command line arguments).
A standard line for a & kde; application looks like this: foo... %i %m -caption \\"%c\\ ". Pretty confusing, -but it has been designed in that way so that it can integrate legacy, non-kde; applications as smoothly as possible. & konqueror;, when executing the line above, will extend the command to foo -icon something. png -miniicon something_mini. png -caption \\"The Foo\\". Both the icon and the mini-icon as well as "The Foo" are properties defined in the. desktop file. If the icons are not defined, they simply default to the executable name foo.
This way a user can change these things in & kmenuedit; for his or her applications. The -caption option is important, because no user will accept that the menu item Editor starts something called kedit-0.9pl4-build47. Instead, he expects a window called Editor. Furthermore these names are localized, i. e. an American user launches CD-Player and gets a window called CD-Player while a German user launches CD-Spieler and gets a window called CD-Spieler.
How do I make & konqueror; start up without a menu bar? I ca n't save a view profile when the menu bar is invisible!
The easiest way to do this is to edit & konqueror; 's configuration file manually. Add the following lines to ~/. kde/ share/ config/ konquerorrc:
[KonqMainWindow] MenuBar=Disabled
On restarting & konqueror;, the menubar should be hidden.
JPEG files no longer show previews in & konqueror; (and I've installed CrossOver Office)
CrossOver creates new & MIME; types that will override the default image/ jpeg and image/ jpg times. In & konqueror;, go to Settings Configure Konqueror, and then to File Associations. Find the application/ x-crossover-jpg and application/ x-crossover-jpeg entries, and remove them. Then hit OK. This problem is reported fixed in the latest version of CrossOver.
