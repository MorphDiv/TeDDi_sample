ANNEX
CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE MEMBER STATES
1 • CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE MEMBER STATES
The Member States shall ensure that in their Member State:
The MAH must ensure that, at launch, all physicians who are expected to prescribe Exjade are provided with a physician information pack containing the following:
Product information Physician information about Exjade (brochure and pocket card) Patient information pack
The physician information about Exjade should contain the following key elements:
• The need to monitor serum ferritin monthly
• That Exjade causes rises in serum creatinine in some patients o The need to monitor serum creatinine • On two occasions prior to initiation of treatment • Every week during the first month of initiation of treatment or after modification of therapy • Monthly thereafter o The need to reduce by 10 mg/ kg the dose if serum creatinine rises: • Adults: > 33% above baseline and creatinine clearance< LLN (90 ml/min) • Paediatrics: either > ULN or creatinine clearance falls to < LLN o The need to interrupt treatment if serum creatinine rises: • Adults and paediatrics: > 33% above baseline or creatinine clearance < LLN (90 ml/min) o The need to consider renal biopsy: • When serum creatinine is elevated and if another abnormality has been detected (eg. proteinuria, signs of Fanconi’s Syndrome).
• The importance of measuring creatinine clearance • Brief overview of methods of measuring creatinine clearance • That rises in serum transaminases occur in patients treated with Exjade o The need for liver function tests prior to prescription, then at monthly intervals or more often if clinically indicated o Not to prescribe to patients with pre-existing severe hepatic disease o The need to interrupt treatment if persistent or progressive increase in liver enzymes were noted. • The need for annual auditory and ophthalmic testing • The need for a guidance table highlighting pre-treatment measurements of serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, proteinuria, hepatic enzymes, ferritin, such as:
Before initiating treatment,
Serum creatinine at Day - X Serum creatinine at Day - Y
Value 1 Value 2
X and Y are the days (to be determined) when pre-treatment measurements should be performed.
• The educational programme should prompt doctors to report serious ADRs and certain selected ADRs as below: • All serious ADRs • Persistent and progressive increase in hepatic enzymes • Increase in serum creatinine levels (> 33% above baseline) or decrease of creatinine clearance (< 90 ml/ min).
2
• • •
Significant changes found in auditory or ophthalmological testing Gallstones Unexpected ADRs according to the SPC.
The Patient inf ormati on pack should include the following information:
o o
Patient inf ormation leaflet Information on the need for regular monitoring, and when it should be carried out, of serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, proteinuria, hepatic enzymes, ferritin
o
Inf ormation that renal biopsy may be considered if significant renal abnormalities occur.
o
Patient b ooklet where the physician can record the results of the above along with the dose of Exjade
o
Reminder card for dates of tests
