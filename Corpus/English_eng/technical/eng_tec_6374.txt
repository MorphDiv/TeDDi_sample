Reporting bugs
Checking for duplicate bugs
Before you report a bug, please first make sure the bug has not been reported yet. Look through the list of known issues, then in the bug tracking system. Also look in support requests, feature requests and the user forum.
Submitting a bug
Please report bugs through the kplayer; bug tracking system. Using SourceForge is much preferable over private e-mail, for it helps prevent duplicate requests.
When you submit a bug, please include all of the following information.
The versions of all relevant programs you are using:
& kplayer;,
& mplayer;,
& kde;,
Qt,
XFree,
the window manager, normally & kwin;.
& kplayer; debug log.
Make sure your console history size is unlimited, for example in & konsole; go to Preferences History and set the Unlimited option.
Run & kplayer; from the console. If the bug is in & kplayer; 's KPart, run the program that uses the KPart instead.
Reproduce the bug.
Then post on SourceForge whatever shows up on the console, clearly marking the point where the problem occurs.
If the problem happened only once and you cannot reproduce it, you can look in the ~/. xsession-errors file to see if it recorded the & kplayer; output when the problem occurred.
If you are not getting any console output from & kplayer;, you may need to recompile & kplayer; with debug information. Follow the instructions in the Compilation micro-HOWTO and give an additional --enable-debug=yes option to the configure script.
The & kplayer; debug output includes & mplayer; messages. To make & mplayer; more verbose put a -v option in the Additional command line arguments field on the Advanced page in kplayer; Settings. You can repeat the option up to three times, separated by spaces, to get even more & mplayer; output.
Run & kplayer; from the console.
