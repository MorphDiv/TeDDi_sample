Migrating from PHP 3 to PHP 4

While handling of global variables had the focus on to be easy in PHP 3 and early versions of PHP 4, the focus has changed to be more secure.
While in PHP 3 the following example worked fine, in PHP 4 it has to be unset( $GLOBALS["id"]);.
This is only one issue of global variable handling.
You should always have used $GLOBALS, with newer versions of PHP 4 you are forced to do so in most cases.
Read more on this subject in the global references section.
Example B-1.
Migration of global variables
?php $id = 1; function test() {global $id; unset($id);} test(); echo($id); / / This will print out 1 in PHP 4?
