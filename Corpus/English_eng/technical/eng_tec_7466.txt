Special precautions for use in animals

This veterinary medicinal product is for spot-on application only.
Do not administer orally or via any other route.
It is important to apply the dose to an area where the animal cannot lick it off.
Do not allow animals to groom each other following treatment.
Care should be taken to ensure that the content of the pipette or the applied dose does not come into contact with the eyes or mouth of the recipient and/ or other animals.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Avoid direct contact with skin, eyes or mouth.
Wash hands thoroughly after use.
In case of accidental spillage onto skin, wash off immediately with soap and water.

Do not smoke, drink or eat while handling the veterinary medicinal product.
Avoid direct contact with treated animals until the application site is dry.

It is therefore recommended to treat the animals during the evening and that recently treated animals are not allowed to sleep with owners, especially children.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Hypersalivation may occur if the animal licks the application site immediately after treatment.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
ATC Vet Code QP 53AX25
Metaflumizone is an ectoparasiticide belonging to the semicarbazone group of compounds.
Metaflumizone is a sodium channel antagonist and disrupts nerve function resulting in paralysis and death of insects.
Metaflumizone is active against fleas due to non-systemic exposure of the parasites on the skin and hair.
Maximum efficacy is achieved within 48 hours.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
After topical administration at a single site on the cat’ s neck at the base of the skull, metaflumizone is rapidly distributed throughout the surface of the skin.
Maximum concentrations in the hair were generally reached between 1 to 2 days post-treatment and gradually declined through 56 days post- treatment.
Metaflumizone was still measurable in the hair 56 days following treatment.
These results are consistent with laboratory efficacy studies showing activity for up to 56 days post-treatment.
After topical administration at a single site on the cat’ s neck at the base of the skull, metaflumizone levels in plasma were too low to allow the calculation of standard pharmacokinetic parameters.
5.3 Environmental properties
See section 6.6
