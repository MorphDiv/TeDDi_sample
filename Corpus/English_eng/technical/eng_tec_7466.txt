To edit object properties
Most object properties can be modified through the object editor sidebar, illustrated below. To use the object editor, a single object must first be selected. See
Print Copy Controls
The object editor will contain a subset of the following tabbed sections, depending on object type:
Text Tabbed Section (Text objects)
This section contains a small editor for changing the content of a text object. It also contains a dropdown menu of available document merge keys, that can be inserted into text.
Image Tabbed Section (Image objects)
This section contains a file entry with preview to select image files. The browse button can be used to easily locate image files. Alternatively, a document merge key can be used instead to provide a filename at print time.
Data Tabbed Section (Barcode objects)
This section contains a text entry to enter literal barcode data. Alternatively, a document merge key can be used to provide this data at print time.
Style Tabbed Section (Text objects)
This section contains controls to select text properties, including font family, font size, font weight, color, and text justification.
Style Tabbed Section (Barcode objects)
This section contains controls to select barcode properties, including barcode style, color, whether to print text, and whether to include a checksum digit.
Line Tabbed Section
This section contains controls to select properties of lines and outlines. These properties include line width and color.
Fill Tabbed Section
This section contains controls to select fill properties of box and ellipse objects. Currently the only fill property is fill color.
Size Tabbed Section (All except line objects)
This section contains controls to select the width and height of an object. A checkbox is provided, so that the current aspect ratio can be locked while manipulating the width and height controls. Image objects also provide a button to reset the size to the image's natural size (Assumes 72DPI).
Size Tabbed Section (Line objects)
This section contains controls to select the length and angle of a line object.
Position Tabbed Section
This section contains controls to change the position of an object.
Shadow Tabbed Section (All except barcode objects)
This section contains controls to add a shadow to an object.
Other Manipulations of Objects
Objects can also be manipulated in the following ways.
Moving and Resizing Objects
Objects can be moved by simply clicking on a selected object and dragging the object to its new location. If the object is part of an aggregate selection, all objects in the selection will move with the object being dragged, maintaining their relative positions to one another. If no object is selected, clicking on an object will create a new selection containing that object. See
A selected object can be resized by clicking one of its resize handle and dragging it to obtain the new size.
Changing Stacking Order
Stacking order refers to relative position in the z-axis of objects. That is when objects overlap, which object will appear on top of the other. By default, newer objects will appear above older objects. To change this order, select one or more objects and choose
Rotating and Flipping Objects
Objects can be rotated 90 degrees in either direction, or flipped horizontally or vertically, by choosing the appropriate menuitem in the
This feature could be useful when you are designing CD box inlays. For the spine caption, you need vertical aligned text. After you have created a basic text box, choose
Aligning Objects
Objects can be aligned horizontally or vertically, relative to one another, or relative to the center line of the label, by choosing the appropriate menuitem from the
Using the Property Bar
The property bar can be used to change some common properties of objects en-masse. These properties include font family, font size, font weight, text alignment, text color, fill color, line or outline color, and line width. The property bar also controls the defaults for these properties for any newly created objects.

The two labels on the left edge can be assigned to a grid, assuming we can define the coordinates for the top left label and the distance to the second label properly. The distance to the left edge is common to these labels. The third one on the right edge has no common distance values with the other ones, that's why we have to define a second layout, with unique coordinates for the top left corner of that label.
You can define multiple layouts only if the labels on the sheet have the same shape. If your sheet contains different shapes, you have to define each shape in another template seperately. Future versions of

In this example we have added three text objects and a barcode object. The first text object contains only simple literal text ("Hello, my name is"). The second text object contains a single merge field ("${Name}") corresponding to the first field of a record (first column of a line) which contains the new crew member's full name. The third text field contains both literal text ("Department: ") followed by a single merge field ("${Department}") corresponding to the second field or the crew member's department. The barcode object is configured to use field (or key) "SN" which contains our crew member's starfleet serial number.

What you may expect from a document merge.
Performing a document merge
Document Merge (sometimes called "Mail Merge") is a powerful feature that allows a unique label or card to be printed for each record in an external data source.
The first step to performing a document merge is to prepare a source document that contains your merge data. This data could be mailing addresses or any other data that you wish to create unique labels or cards for. Currently back-ends only exist for text files and the evolution data server -- others are planned. The currently supported text-file format is very simple: each line is a record; fields are delimited by commas (CSV), tabs, or colons; and newlines can be embedded into fields by using the "\
" entity. This file could be created using any text editor or could be created by another program or script. A common way of creating CSV files is to export them from a spreadsheet program or from address book applications.

To print labels and cards
To print labels or cards, choose
The
The Labels Tab of the Print Dialog
Print control (Simple)
For simple labels or cards (no document merge), the job tabbed section contains the following copy controls.
The number of copies of the label can be selected by choosing the number of full sheets to print, or a specific subset of labels on a single sheet.
The mini-preview can also be used to graphically select the subset of labels by clicking the first label on the mini-preview and dragging to the last label.
Print control (Merge)
For labels or cards using the document merge (also known as "mail merge") capability, the job tabbed section contains the following merge controls instead of copy controls.
Print Document Merge Controls
The total number of labels or cards printed is the product of the number of records in the merge source and the number of copies selected. If multiple copies are selected, these can be either collated (copies of the same record grouped together) or un-collated (one copy each record is printed before next copy).
Printing can begin on any label on the first sheet. This can be selected with the
The mini-preview can also be used to graphically select this first label, by clicking on the desired label in the mini-preview.
Options
The following options can also be selected.

Print outlines of labels. This option is useful for dry-runs, to test printer alignment.

Prints the labels as mirror images. This option is useful for printing on clear labels that will be viewed from the reverse side (e.g. in a car window).

Prints crop marks along the edge of the sheet. This option is useful for printing on blank stock, to be cut after printing. This option does not work well with all templates.

How to skip blank address lines when doing a document merge.
Skipping blank address lines
This feature can be best described by a simple example. In the following CSV file, column 5 (ADDR2) contains the second address line for each record. This field is empty in records 1 and 2, but not in record 3. (For this feature to work, the field must be completely empty -- any text, including spaces will defeat this feature.)

In the following screenshot, a single multiline text object has been created to format these addresses. Notice that ${ADDR2} representing the second address line is on a line by itself. (Any additional text on this line, including spaces would defeat this feature.)
Multi-line address
Printing this label results in the following output. Notice that the line containing the ${ADDR2} field is completely skipped for the first two records, without printing a blank line.
