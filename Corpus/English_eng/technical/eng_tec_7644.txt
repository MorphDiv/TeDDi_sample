EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
ADVOCATE
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report.
Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) on the basis of the documentation provided, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian.
If you need more information about your animal’ s medical condition or treatment, contact your veterinarian.
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Advocate?
Advocate is a clear yellow to brownish antiparasitic solution that contains two active substances, imidacloprid and moxidectin.
Advocate comes in different strengths and pack sizes, depending on whether it is for use on cats or on dogs, and on the size of the animal being treated.
What is Advocate used for?
Advocate is used for cats and dogs suffering from, or at risk from, mixed parasitic infections (caused by several different types of parasites): • for the treatment and prevention of flea infestations in cats and dogs • as part of treatment strategies for flea allergy dermatitis (an allergic reaction to flea bites) in cats and dogs • for the treatment of ear mite infestations in cats and dogs • for the treatment of biting lice infestations in dogs • for the treatment of skin diseases in dogs caused by parasitic mites (sarcoptic mange and demodicosis) • for the prevention of heartworm disease in cats and dogs • for the treatment of French heartworm disease in dogs • for the treatment of infections with certain (as specified in the Package Leaflet) gastrointestinal roundworms in cats and dogs.
The Package Leaflet includes detailed information on how long the product works against each parasite for, and how often Advocate treatments should be given.
Advocate is applied to cats and dogs from pre-filled spot-on pipettes.
These are small plastic containers which are already filled with the correct amount of Advocate needed to treat one cat or dog.
Advocate for Cats is available in 2 different size pipettes for different cat weights.
Advocate for dogs is available in 4 different size pipettes for different dog weights.
The contents of a full pipette is applied onto the animal’ s skin, after parting the fur.
In cats, the product is applied to the cat’ s neck at the base of the skull.
In dogs it is applied between the shoulder blades at the bottom of the dog’ s head, but for large dogs (above 25 kg) the product should be applied in 3 or 4 spots along the dog ’ s back, whilst it is standing, from between its shoulder blades to the base of its tail.

The two active substances in Advocate interact with receptors in the parasites.
Imidacloprid interferes with certain specific receptors (nicotinergic acetylcholine receptors) in the nervous systems of lice and fleas, which results in their subsequent paralysis and death.
Moxidectin interferes with different receptors (GABA and glutamate-gated chloride channels) in the other parasites, leading to their paralysis, death and expulsion.
How has Advocate been studied?
Data were provided on the pharmaceutical quality, the tolerance of the products in cats and dogs, the safety in humans (people in contact with the product) and the safety to the environment.
The effectiveness of the products against the specified parasites was investigated in laboratory studies.
Subsequently the efficacy was confirmed in several field studies in cats and dogs, which were conducted in several different European geographical locations.
Cats and dogs from various breeds, age groups and weights were treated.
The effectiveness of the product was measured by looking at the number of live parasites at various times after treatment.
What benefit has Advocate shown during the studies?
The results of the laboratory and field trials in cats and dogs showed that Advocate is effective, when used as detailed in the Package Leaflet (see “ What is Advocate used for? ” above, or for more details see the Package Leaflet).
What is the risk associated with Advocate?
In both cats and dogs the most common side effects are local reactions at the place where the product has been applied, such as temporary itchiness, and on rare occasions, greasy fur and redness of the skin.
Vomiting has also occurred rarely.
These signs disappear without further treatment.
If a cat or dog licks the application area, it might salivate a lot for a short period and then might show signs such as a lack of muscular co-ordination, shaking, abnormal breathing and/ or vomiting.
Dogs and cats weighing less than 1 kg should only be treated after special consideration by the veterinarian.
Advocate should not be used in young cats that are under 9 weeks of age.
Advocate should not be used in young dogs that are under 7 weeks of age.
As with other products of this type, Advocate should not be used in sick or ill cats or dogs.
As Advocate comes in different strengths depending on whether it is for use on cats or on dogs, it is very important that the cat products should only be used for cats, and the dog products for dogs.
Neither product should be used for any other animal species.
Advocate has harmful effects on aquatic organisms and so the product should not be allowed to enter ditches, ponds or streams.
Dogs should not be allowed to swim in ditches, ponds or streams for 4 days after treatment.
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal?
The Package Leaflet should be read before use.
As a precautionary measure, skin contact with the pipette contents should be avoided and animals should not be stroked or groomed until the application site is dry.
When administering Advocate, the user should not smoke, eat or drink, and should wash their hands thoroughly after use.
If accidental exposure occurs, the eyes should be rinsed with water or the skin washed with soap and water.

People with a known sensitivity to benzyl alcohol, imidacloprid or moxidectin should administer the product with caution.
The solvent in Advocate may stain certain materials including leather, fabrics, plastics and finished surfaces, so contact between the product and such surfaces should be avoided.
Why has Advocate been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) concluded that the benefits of Advocate exceed the risks for cats and dogs suffering from, or at risk from, mixed parasitic infections, and recommended that Advocate be given a marketing authorisation.
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR.
Other information about Advocate:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Advocate to Bayer HealthCare AG (previously called Bayer AG) on 2 April 2003.
Information on the prescription status of this product may be found on the outer package.
