Functions

The old_function statement allows you to declare a function using a syntax identical to PHP / FI2 (except you must replace'function 'with'old_function'.
This is a deprecated feature, and should only be used by the PHP / FI2 - PHP 3 convertor.
Warning
Functions declared as old_function cannot be called from PHP 's internal code.
Among other things, this means you can' t use them in functions such as usort(), array_walk(), and register_shutdown_function().
You can get around this limitation by writing a wrapper function (in normal PHP 3 form) to call the old_function.
