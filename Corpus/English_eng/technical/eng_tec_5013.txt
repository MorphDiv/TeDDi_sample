?php define_syslog_variables(); / / open syslog, include the process ID and also send / / the log to standard error, and use a user defined / / logging mechanism openlog("myScripLog", LOG_PID | LOG_PERROR, LOG_LOCAL0); / / some code if (authorized_client()) {/ / do something} else {/ / unauthorized client! / / log the attempt $access = date("Y / m/d H:i:s"); syslog(LOG_WARNING ,"Unauthorized client: $access $REMOTE_ADDR ($HTTP_USER_AGENT)");} closelog();?
