Select the file format of the image files to be sent.
JPEG: The Joint Photographic Experts Group file format is a good web file format but it uses lossy compression. PNG: the Portable Network Graphics format is an extensible file format for the lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images. PNG provides a patent-free replacement for GIF and can also replace many common uses of TIFF. PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications, such as the World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a progressive display option. Also, PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color-matching on heterogeneous platforms.
