Format
You can choose among various options for formatting a $[officename] Math formula.
The format options are displayed in the lower half of the Formula Elements window.
These options are also listed in the
context menu
of the
Commands
window.
View - Formula Elements
) or through the context menu of the
Commands
window.
The letter &quot; a &quot; refers to the placeholder in your formula which you would like to assign to the respective formatting.
You can substitute this character for any other you like.
Formatting options
Icon
Superscript left
Inserts a superscript to the left of a placeholder.
You can also type
< ? > lsup{ < ? > }
in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Superscript top
Inserts a superscript directly above a placeholder.
You can also type
< ? > csup < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Superscript right
Inserts a superscript to the right of a placeholder.
You can also type
< ? > ^{ < ? > }
directly in the
Commands
window, or you can use
rsup
or
sup
.
Icon
Vertical stack (2 elements)
Inserts a vertical stack (binomial) with two placeholders.
You can also type
binom < ? > < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
New line
Inserts a new line in your document.
You can also type
newline
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Subscript left
Inserts a subscript to the left of a placeholder.
You can also type
< ? > lsub{ < ? > }
in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Subscript bottom
Inserts a subscript directly under a placeholder.
You can also type
< ? > csub < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Subscript right
Inserts a subscript to the right of a placeholder.
You can also type
< ? > _{ < ? > }
in the
Commands
window, and the subscript dash can be replaced by
rsub
or
sub
.
Icon
Vertical stack (3 elements)
Inserts a vertical stack with three placeholders.
You can also type
stack { < ? > # < ? > # < ? > }
in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Small gap
Inserts a small gap between a placeholder and the next element.
You can also type
`
directly in the Commands window.
The command must appear to the left or right of a symbol, variable, number or complete command.
Icon
Align left
This icon assigns left-alignment to &quot; a &quot; and inserts a placeholder.
You can type
alignl < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Align to horizontal centre
Assigns horizontal central alignment to &quot; a &quot; and inserts a placeholder.
You can also type
alignc < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Align right
Inserts the command for right alignment and a placeholder.
You can also type
alignr < ? >
in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Matrix stack
This icon inserts a matrix with four placeholders.
You can also type
matrix{ < ? > # < ? > ## < ? > # < ? > }
directly in the
Commands
window.
The position of an element inside this diagram is indicated by two coordinates; the first specifies the row number and the second the column number.
You can expand this matrix in any direction in the
Commands
window by adding characters.
Icon
Gap
This icon inserts a gap or space between placeholders.
You can also type
~
directly in the
Commands
window.
The command must appear to the left or right of a symbol, variable, number or complete command.
alignl, alignc
and
alignr
commands are especially effective, if you are
{alignl a}over{b+c}
binom{2*n}{alignr k}
matrix{alignr a#b+2##c+1/3#alignl d}
and
a+b-c newline alignr x/y
When using the align instructions, note that
a+b alignr c
, but not
a+alignr b
{alignl{alignr a}}over{b+c}
aligns
a
on the right.
To align using the &quot; matrix &quot; command
matrix{
alignr sin^2 x + cos^2 x#{}={}#alignl 1 ##
alignr cos^2 x #{}={} #alignl 1 - sin^2 x
}
Aligning to the left
align
commands.
An example is
stack{a+b-c*d#alignr &quot; text &quot; }
, where &quot; text &quot; appears aligned to the right.
Note that text must always be enclosed with quotation marks.
Format - Alignment
menu.
To do this, place an empty character string, that is, the inverted commas which surround any text &quot; &quot; , before the section of formula that you want to align.
For example, typing
&quot; &quot; a+b newline &quot; &quot; c+d
results in both equations being left-aligned instead of centred.
When typing information in the Commands window, note that some formats require spaces for the correct structure.
This is especially true when entering values (for example, a lsup{3}) instead of placeholders.
