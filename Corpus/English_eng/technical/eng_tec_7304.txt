This is an invalid record! The problem could be in the %(field)s field. Reason: %(reason)s
Your command contains one or more of the character %, this is special for cron and cannot be used with Gnome-schedule because of the format it uses to store extra information on the crontab line. Please use the | redirector character to achieve the same functionality. Refer to the crontab manual for more information about the % character. If you don not want to use it for redirection it must be properly escaped with the \\ letter.

Recurrent tasks will be run from the home directory.
