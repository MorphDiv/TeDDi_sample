Swell Foop is a puzzle game, of which the objective is to clear the window of as many pieces as possible by clicking on groups of the same colored pieces. That group will vanish and the pieces on top will fall until there are none left or no more color groups.

Playing


The board starts as a full grid of objects. Depending on the size of board you select, there are either three or four types of object. If a group of objects are adjacent and all the same type, then they can be removed simply by clicking them with the mouse (or by pressing the space bar). When you move the mouse over a group you can remove, the objects will start moving. The number of objects in the group, and the points you will score for removing that group, is shown in the lower left corner of the window. The more objects in the group, the more points you will score. Once the group has been removed the objects above them fall down to fill the space. If an entire column is cleared then the objects slide leftward to fill the gap.
1. Eliminate groups of two or more
2. Objects fall down to fill the gaps
3. Objects move left to fill empty columns
4. New groups are formed and the cycle repeats
Scoring is based on the number of objects you delete:

Strategy
The most important rule when aiming for a high score is to think ahead: each group you remove will form and destroy other groups.
Remove higher groups first, unless removing another group will make it larger. Vertically aligned objects can't be misaligned, but horizontal arrangements can.
Since the score increases quadratically, big groups of objects are always better. For example, the points difference between a six object group and a seven object group is nine points. In a situation where you have a choice between merging two groups of two into four or just adding one more to the group of six then you should add the single object. Even though the groups of two you are left with score no points, the bigger group scores more overall.
Don't forget the thousand point bonus for clearing all the balls. To get 1000 points from a single group you need 34 objects. You are very unlikely to be in a position where you have to sacrifice a group that large to clear the board.
