Screen scaling. That prints according to the screen resolution.
Original size (calculate from scan resolution)
Calculates the print size from the scan resolution. Enter the scan resolution in the dialog field below.
Scale image to custom dimension
Set the print size yourself in the dialog below. The image is centered on the paper.
Scale image to fit to page
Printout uses maximum space on the selected pager. Aspect ratio is maintained.
