& ksame; is a nice little program meant to amuse you for anywhere from 3 minutes to 6 days (straight).
KDE
kdegames
ksame
Introduction
& ksame; is a simple game. It is played by one player, so there is only one winner: -) You play for fun and against the high score. It has been inspired by SameGame, which is only really famous on the Macintosh.
In 1997 & Stephan. Kulow; and Marcus Kreutzberger wrote Probiere (a German pun). It was their first attempt to write a X11 application. They decided that it would be a good idea to port it to & kde;, and here we are.
Using & ksame;
A very simple premise. There are a bunch of marbles. Get rid of them all.; -)
You can erase same marbles when they are connected vertically or horizontally when you click them. If there are pieces over the erased ones, they will drop down. If all of the pieces on the vertical line are erased, all pieces on the right side will slide to the left.
The score is calculated as follows:
Subtract 2 from the number of marbles erased, and square the result.
As an example, if you erase 7 balls, then you get 25 points (7 minus 2 = 5. 5 squared is 25 points). If you erase 8 balls, then you get 36 points (8 minus 2 = 6. 6 squared is 36 points.
Get as many of the same pieces as you can, and then erase them in one click. That way you will get a higher score. The game is over when there are no pieces that can be erased.
The score will then be decreased according to the number of remaining pieces. If you erase all pieces 1,000 bonus points will be added to the final score.
More & ksame; Features
& ksame; is wonderful in that it will allow you to kill 5 minutes while you wait for that program to compile.
Or, if nothing else, it will allow you to kill 5 minutes.
