Erasing a CD or DVD

DVD+RW (single or dual layer)
Erasing or blanking a CD or DVD means to delete all the data that the CD or the DVD contains.
In general,
Make sure that the media you want to erase is erasable. Check the media case for more information.
Insert the erasable CD or DVD in your drive.

The blanking process will permanently destroy all of the data on the disc.
What is fast blanking?
Fast blanking is a way of quickly erasing a disc. This method is much faster than fully erasing the disc and is sufficient to allow the disc to be written to again.
The full erasing procedure is slower but is more secure, as it removes all traces of previous data. Data removed from fast blanked media can still be recovered with special tools.
Checking the Integrity of a CD or DVD
Checking the integrity of a CD or DVD makes sure that the files written to the disc are intact and have not been corrupted during the burning process.
