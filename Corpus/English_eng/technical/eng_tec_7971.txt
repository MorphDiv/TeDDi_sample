3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe Clear to slightly opalescent.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Prophylaxis of influenza for adults, especially in those who run an increased risk of associated complications.
The use of Optaflu should be based on official recommendations.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Adults:
0.5 ml.
Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular (into the deltoid muscle) injection.
Children and adolescents (< 18 years of age):
Optaflu is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).
2 4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients.
Immunisation shall be postponed in patients with febrile illness or acute infection.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.
Optaflu should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly.
Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Optaflu may be given at the same time as other vaccines.
Immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs.
It should be noted that adverse reactions may be intensified.
The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment.
Following influenza vaccination, false positive results in serology tests using the ELISA method to detect antibodies against HIV-1, Hepatitis C and especially HTLV-1 have been observed.
The Western Blot technique disproves the results.
The transient false positive reactions may be due to the IgM response to the vaccine.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
The safety of Optaflu in pregnancy and breast-feeding has not been assessed in pre-clinical studies or in clinical trials.
In general data from influenza vaccinations in pregnant women do not indicate adverse fetal and maternal outcomes attributable to the vaccine.
The use of Optaflu may be considered from the second trimester of pregnancy.
For pregnant women with medical conditions that increase their risk of complications from influenza, administration of the vaccine is recommended, irrespective of their stage of pregnancy.
Optaflu may be used during lactation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The vaccine is unlikely to produce an effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adverse reactions from clinical trials:
The safety of the Optaflu has been assessed in six randomized, active controlled clinical trials performed as part of the development program.
Overall 3439 single doses of Optaflu were administered to 2366 adults aged 18 – 60 years of age and to 1073 elderly (aged 61 years or older).
Safety and reactogenicity evaluations were performed for all subjects during the first 3 weeks following vaccination and SAEs have been collected for approximately 3100 vaccinees during six months of follow-up.
So far there are no data from post-marketing experiences with Optaflu.
In adults, the following undesirable effects have been observed during clinical trials with Optaflu:
Very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10000 to < 1/ 1000); very rare (< 1/ 10000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
3 Frequency in adults (18-60 years of age)
Organ class Blood and lymphatic system disorders
Very common ≥ 1/ 10
Common ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10
Uncommon ≥ 1/ 1000 to < 1/ 100
Rare ≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1000
Very rare < 1/ 10,000 Transient thrombocytopenia
Nervous system disorders
Headache*
Neurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain Barré syndrome
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
Sweating*
Generalised skin reactions including pruritus, urticaria or non-specific rash
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders
Myalgia*, arthralgia*
Vascular disorders
Vasculitis, possibly associated with transient renal involvement
General disorders and administration site disorders
Erythema*, pain* Malaise*,
Swelling*, ecchymosis*, induration* Fever*,
Local lymphadeno- pathy
fatigue*
shivering* Gastrointestinal disorders such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea or dyspepsia*
Fever greater than 39.0°C
Immune system disorders
Allergic reactions, in very rare cases leading to shock
* These reactions usually disappeared within 1-2 days without treatment.
In the elderly frequencies were similar, exept for headache and pain which were classified as ‘ common’.
The incidence rates for moderate and severe pain after Optaflu vaccination are similar to those of egg-derived influenza vaccines; however a slightly increased risk for mild short-lasting injection site pain was observed with Optaflu in the subgroup of elderly vaccinees (8% compared to 6% with egg-derived influenza vaccine).
With egg-derived influenza vaccines neuralgia, paraesthesia and febrile convulsions have been observed rarely.
4.9 Overdose
Overdosage is unlikely to have any untoward effect.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Influenza vaccine, ATC-Code:
J07BB02
Seroprotection is generally obtained within 3 weeks, as shown by the pivotal phase III clinical study V58P4 for the adult and elderly population.
In this comparative trial against an egg-derived influenza vaccine the seroprotection rate*, seroconversion or significant increase rate** and the geometric mean ratio (GMR) for anti-HA antibody (measured by HI) were assessed according to predefined criteria.
Data for adults were as follows (values in brackets show the 95% confidence intervals):

(5.35, 6.53)
(8.77, 11)
** Seroconversion = negative pre-vaccination HI titer and post-vaccination HI titer ≥ 40; significant increase = positive pre-vaccination HI titer and at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination HI titer.
No differences were observed between the cell-culture and the comparator egg-derived vaccine.
Across all three influenza strains, for the egg-derived vaccine seroprotection rates ranged between 85% and 98%, seroconversion or significant increase rates ranged between 62% and 73% and GMRs ranged between 5.52- and 8.76-fold over baseline HI titers.
The persistence of postvaccination antibodies to strains included in the vaccine is usually 6-12 months, as shown by studies performed during the clinical development of this vaccine.
Optaflu has not been studied in the paediatric population and therefore, data on immune response are not available for this age group.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Not applicable
5 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on animal studies that are appropriate for the safety assessment of vaccines.
Optaflu was well tolerated and immunogenic in mice and ferrets.
In a repeated-dose toxicity study in rabbits there was no evidence of systemic toxicity and the vaccine was locally well tolerated.
Genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction were not assessed because these studies are not appropriate for a vaccine.

Further information
1.
WHAT OPTAFLU IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Optaflu is a vaccine against flu (influenza).
Due to the kind of manufacturing Optaflu is free of chicken/ egg protein.
For manufacturing the vaccine the influenza virus was killed and prepared in a special way that the vaccine only contains influenza virus surface proteins (influenza virus surface antigens).
These proteins stimulate your immune system so that it can develop a protection against flu.
Optaflu is used to prevent flu in adults, especially in those who run an increased risk of experiencing associated complications in case they fall ill with flu.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE OPTAFLU
You must NOT use Optaflu • if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to influenza vaccine or any of the other ingredients of Optaflu • if you have an acute illness associated with fever • if you have an acute infection.
Take special care with Optaflu BEFORE receiving the vaccine • you should tell your doctor if your immune system is impaired, or if you are undergoing treatment which affects the immune system, e. g. with medicine against cancer (chemotherapy) or corticosteroid medicines (see Section 2, “ Taking other medicines”). • your doctor or nurse will make sure that appropriate medical treatment and supervision is readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction (a very severe allergic reaction with symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash) following the administration.
This reaction may occur with Optaflu as with all vaccines that are injected.
WHILE receiving the vaccine • your doctor or nurse will take care not to inject Optaflu into a blood vessel.
Children and adolescents
19 • Optaflu is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age since there is no information available.
Taking other medicines Special care should be taken if you are receiving Optaflu and any of the following medicines at the same time: • medicines against cancer (chemotherapy), corticosteroid medicines (such as cortisone) or other medicines affecting the immune system.
Tell your doctor if you are being treated with such medicines.
The immune response of your body may be weakened.
Therefore the vaccine may work less effectively. • other vaccines.
Optaflu may be given at the same time as other vaccines.
In this case the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs.
Note that the side effects of the vaccines may be intensified.
Please tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
The safety of Optaflu in pregnant and breast-feeding women has not been determined.
The limited data from influenza vaccinations in pregnant women do not indicate that there are negative effects for the unborn child.
The use of this vaccine may be considered from the second trimester of pregnancy.
For pregnant women with medical conditions that increase their risk of complications from the flu, administration of the vaccine is recommended, irrespective of their stage of pregnancy.
Optaflu may be used during breast feeding.
Therefore your doctor will decide whether you should receive Optaflu if you are pregnant or breast- feeding.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Optaflu This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially ‘ sodium-free’.
This medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially ‘ potassium- free’.
3.
HOW TO USE OPTAFLU
Optaflu is applied to you by your doctor or nurse.
Usual dose for persons of 18 years and older:
0.5 ml of Optaflu suspension.
Optaflu is injected into the muscle on the top of the upper arm (deltoid muscle).
Optaflu should under no circumstances be injected into a blood vessel.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Optaflu can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
The following undesirable effects have been observed during clinical trials:
Very common Common Uncommon Rare Very rare
in more than 1 in 10 vaccinees in more than 1 in 100 vaccinees, but less than 1 in 10 vaccinees in more than 1 in 1,000 vaccinees, but less than 1 in 100 vaccinees in more than 1 in 10,000 vaccinees, but less than 1 in 1,000 vaccinees in less than 1 in 10,000 vaccinees, including isolated reports
20 Very serious side effects Tell your doctor immediately or go to the casualty department at your nearest hospital if you experience the following side effect – you may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation:
Very rare: • difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash which are symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction (a very severe allergic reaction) Rare: • numbness and tingling sensation • painful disorders of the nerves, e. g. attacks of extreme pain in the face, throat or ear fits (convulsions) (only observed with egg-derived influenza vaccines)
Also, tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following side effects – you may need medical attention:
Very rare: • skin rashes, fever, joint pain or kidney problems which are symptoms of an inflammation of the blood vessels • fever, headache, vomiting and drowsiness progressing to coma or fits (convulsions) which are symptoms of an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord • weakness beginning in the legs and progressing to the arms with numbness and tingling sensation which are symptoms of an inflammation of the nerves
Serious side effects Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following side effects – you may need medical attention:
Very Rare: • bleeding or bruising which are symptoms of a low platelet count in the blood
Mild side effects Very common: • flu-like symptoms such as headache, feeling of discomfort, tiredness. • Pain, reddening.
These reactions are usually mild and only last a few days.
Pain and headache were common in the elderly.
Common: • sweating, joint and muscle pain, chills, hardening or swelling at the site of the injection, bruising, fever, shivering • gastrointestinal disorders such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea or disturbance of the digestive tract These reactions are usually mild and only last a few days.
Uncommon: • generalised skin reactions such as itching, bumps on the skin or non-specific rash
Rare: • swelling and pain of local lymphnodes • Fever greater than 39.0 °C
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
