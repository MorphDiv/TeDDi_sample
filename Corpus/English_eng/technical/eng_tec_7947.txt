oggenc from %s %s
Usage: oggenc [options] inputfile [...]
OPTIONS:
 General:
 -Q, --quiet Produce no output to stderr
 -h, --help Print this help text
 -V, --version Print the version number
-k, --skeleton Adds an Ogg Skeleton bitstream
 -r, --raw Raw mode. Input files are read directly as PCM data
 -B, --raw-bits=n Set bits/sample for raw input; default is 16
 -C, --raw-chan=n Set number of channels for raw input; default is 2
 -R, --raw-rate=n Set samples/sec for raw input; default is 44100
 --raw-endianness 1 for bigendian, 0 for little (defaults to 0)
-b, --bitrate Choose a nominal bitrate to encode at. Attempt
 to encode at a bitrate averaging this. Takes an
 argument in kbps. By default, this produces a VBR
 encoding, equivalent to using -q or --quality.
 See the --managed option to use a managed bitrate
 targetting the selected bitrate.
--managed Enable the bitrate management engine. This will allow
 much greater control over the precise bitrate(s) used,
 but encoding will be much slower. Don't use it unless
 you have a strong need for detailed control over
 bitrate, such as for streaming.
-m, --min-bitrate Specify a minimum bitrate (in kbps). Useful for
 encoding for a fixed-size channel. Using this will
 automatically enable managed bitrate mode (see
 --managed).
 -M, --max-bitrate Specify a maximum bitrate in kbps. Useful for
 streaming applications. Using this will automatically
 enable managed bitrate mode (see --managed).
--advanced-encode-option option=value
 Sets an advanced encoder option to the given value.
 The valid options (and their values) are documented
 in the man page supplied with this program. They are
 for advanced users only, and should be used with
 caution.
-q, --quality Specify quality, between -1 (very low) and 10 (very
 high), instead of specifying a particular bitrate.
 This is the normal mode of operation.
 Fractional qualities (e.g. 2.75) are permitted
 The default quality level is 3.
--resample n Resample input data to sampling rate n (Hz)
 --downmix Downmix stereo to mono. Only allowed on stereo
 input.
 -s, --serial Specify a serial number for the stream. If encoding
 multiple files, this will be incremented for each
 stream after the first.
--discard-comments Prevents comments in FLAC and Ogg FLAC files from
 being copied to the output Ogg Vorbis file.
 --ignorelength Ignore the datalength in Wave headers. This allows
 support for files > 4GB and STDIN data streams.
Naming:
 -o, --output=fn Write file to fn (only valid in single-file mode)
 -n, --names=string Produce filenames as this string, with %%a, %%t, %%l,
 %%n, %%d replaced by artist, title, album, track number,
 and date, respectively (see below for specifying these).
 %%%% gives a literal %%.
-X, --name-remove=s Remove the specified characters from parameters to the
 -n format string. Useful to ensure legal filenames.
 -P, --name-replace=s Replace characters removed by --name-remove with the
 characters specified. If this string is shorter than the
 --name-remove list or is not specified, the extra
 characters are just removed.
 Default settings for the above two arguments are platform
 specific.
--utf8 Tells oggenc that the command line parameters date, title,
 album, artist, genre, and comment are already in UTF-8.
 On Windows, this switch applies to file names too.
 -c, --comment=c Add the given string as an extra comment. This may be
 used multiple times. The argument should be in the
 format "tag=value".
 -d, --date Date for track (usually date of performance)
-N, --tracknum Track number for this track
 -t, --title Title for this track
 -l, --album Name of album
 -a, --artist Name of artist
 -G, --genre Genre of track
-L, --lyrics Include lyrics from given file (.srt or .lrc format)
 -Y, --lyrics-language Sets the language for the lyrics
If multiple input files are given, then multiple
 instances of the previous eight arguments will be used,
 in the order they are given. If fewer titles are
 specified than files, OggEnc will print a warning, and
 reuse the final one for the remaining files. If fewer
 track numbers are given, the remaining files will be
 unnumbered. If fewer lyrics are given, the remaining
 files will not have lyrics added. For the others, the
 final tag will be reused for all others without warning
 (so you can specify a date once, for example, and have
 it used for all the files)
INPUT FILES:
 OggEnc input files must currently be 24, 16, or 8 bit PCM Wave, AIFF, or AIFF/C
 files, 32 bit IEEE floating point Wave, and optionally FLAC or Ogg FLAC. Files
 may be mono or stereo (or more channels) and any sample rate.
 Alternatively, the --raw option may be used to use a raw PCM data file, which
 must be 16 bit stereo little-endian PCM ('headerless Wave'), unless additional
 parameters for raw mode are specified.
 You can specify taking the file from stdin by using - as the input filename.
 In this mode, output is to stdout unless an output filename is specified
 with -o
 Lyrics files may be in SubRip (.srt) or LRC (.lrc) format

Usage:

 vorbiscomment <\-a\|\-w> [-Re] [-c file] [-t tag] inputfile [outputfile]
Listing options
-l, --list List the comments (default if no options are given)
Editing options

-t "name=value", --tag "name=value"
 Specify a comment tag on the commandline
-w, --write Write comments, replacing the existing ones

 When listing, write comments to the specified file.
 When editing, read comments from the specified file.
-R, --raw Read and write comments in UTF-8
-e, --escapes Use \
-style escapes to allow multiline comments.
-V, --version Output version information and exit
If no output file is specified, vorbiscomment will modify the input file. This
is handled via temporary file, such that the input file is not modified if any
errors are encountered during processing.
vorbiscomment handles comments in the format "name=value", one per line. By
default, comments are written to stdout when listing, and read from stdin when
editing. Alternatively, a file can be specified with the -c option, or tags
can be given on the commandline with -t "name=value". Use of either -c or -t
disables reading from stdin.
Examples:
 vorbiscomment -a in.ogg -c comments.txt
 vorbiscomment -a in.ogg -t "ARTIST=Some Guy" -t "TITLE=A Title"
NOTE: Raw mode (--raw, -R) will read and write comments in UTF-8 rather than
converting to the user's character set, which is useful in scripts. However,
this is not sufficient for general round-tripping of comments in all cases,
since comments can contain newlines. To handle that, use escaping (-e,
--escape).
