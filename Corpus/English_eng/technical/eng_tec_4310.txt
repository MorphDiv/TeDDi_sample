(PHP 3, PHP 4)
This function returns an associative array returning any of the various components of the URL that are present.
This includes the
scheme - e.g. http
host
port
user
pass
path
query - after the question mark?
fragment - after the hashmark #
This function is not meant to validate the given URL, it only breaks it up into the above listed parts.
Partial urls are also accepted, parse_url() tries its best to parse them correctly.
Example 1.
Using parse_url()
$php -r 'print_r (parse_url("http: / /username:password@hostname / path?arg=value#anchor"));' Array ([scheme] = http [host] = hostname [user] = username [pass] = password [path] = / path [query] = arg=value [fragment] = anchor) $php -r'print_r (parse_url("http: / /invalid_host..name / ")); 'Array ([scheme] = http [host] = invalid_host..name [path] = /)
See also pathinfo(), parse_str(), dirname(), and basename().
