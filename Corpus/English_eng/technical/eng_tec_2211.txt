Condition
Define conditions for conditional styles here.
Conditional styles are paragraph styles that have different properties depending on the context.
Once defined, you cannot change the conditional properties of a conditional style.
Context
that has an
Applied Style
linked to it, then the
Paragraph Style
from that condition is used.
If no style is linked to the
Context
, then the attributes defined in the conditional style apply.
The following example illustrates this relationship:
Format

Page
-
Header
).
New
in the
Styles and Formatting
window, and selecting all the paragraph properties that you want for your business letter in the
Paragraph Style
dialogue box.

You also can select your own style.
Paragraph Styles
list box or by using
Apply
.
OK
to close the Paragraph Style dialogue box, and then format all paragraphs in your business letter, including the header, with the new &quot; Business letter &quot; conditional Paragraph Style.
(When you click in the header, you may need to display
All Styles
or
Custom Styles
in the style list to use the new business letter style.)
The header text now has the attributes you specified in the Header Paragraph Style, while the other parts of the document have the attributes defined in the business letter conditional Paragraph Style.
The &quot; Text body &quot; Style was created as a conditional style.
Therefore, any styles you derive from it can be used as conditional styles.
The Paragraph Style applied to the context is used when exporting to other formats (RTF, HTML, and so on).
