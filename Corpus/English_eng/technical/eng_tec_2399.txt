(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Given a string containing a path to a file, this function will return the base name of the file.
If the filename ends in suffix this will also be cut off.
On Windows, both slash (/) and backslash (\) are used as path separator character.
In other environments, it is the forward slash (/).
Example 1. basename() example
$path = "/ home / httpd / html / index.php"; $file = basename ($path); / / $file is set to "index.php" $file = basename ($path ,".php"); / / $file is set to "index "
Note:
The suffix parameter was added in PHP 4.1.0.
