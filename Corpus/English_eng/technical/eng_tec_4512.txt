(PHP 4 = 4.3.0)
pg_update() updates records that matches condition with data.
If options is specified, pg_convert() is applied to data with specified options.
Example 1. pg_update
?php $db = pg_connect ('dbname=foo'); $data = array('field1'= 'AA', 'field2'= 'BB'); / / This is safe, since $_POST is converted automatically $res = pg_update($db, 'post_log', $_POST, $data); if ($res) {echo "Data is updated: $res\n";} else {echo "User must have sent wrong inputs\n";}?
Note:
This function is experimental.
