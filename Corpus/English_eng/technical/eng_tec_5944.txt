The panel
How do I add applications to the & kde; panel (kicker;)?
There are several ways to add an application to the panel, of which the easiest is to right-click on the panel, and from the context menu which appears, select Panel Menu Add to Panel Application Button and then the application for which you want to add a link.
For more ways of adding buttons to the panel, refer to the & kicker; Handbook.
Is it possible to change the K button of the panel to another picture?
The simplest way is to download a new icon theme with a & kmenu; icon you prefer from http: / /www. kde-look. org and install it using the & kcontrolcenter;.
In order to change only the & kmenu; icon you can overwrite the kmenu. png image for every size in an icon theme set. So, for & kde; default icons this would be $KDEDIR / share/ icons/ default. kde/ size / apps/ kmenu. png, where size is one of the sizes included in the & kde; icon theme. To see your new icon, either log out of & kde; and back in again, or run the command dcop kicker kicker restart to restart the panel.
After an upgrade my & kmenu; appears to be empty! How can I get my menu back?
In & kde; 3.2 and later local modifications to the & kmenu; are stored in $HOME /. config/ menus/ applications-kmenuedit. menu. Try moving this file out of the way and then issuing the command kbuildsycoca4 --noincremental. This should restore you to the default system menus.
My desktop panel has disappeared. How can I get it back?
The panel disappearing is usually due to it crashing. This is most often caused by loading an applet that has a fatal bug or due to a bad installation of & kde; and/ or the panel.
The easiest way to get the panel back is to launch the Run Command window by pressing Alt; F2 and entering kicker and then pressing the OK button.
If the panel continues to disappear, you may wish to either remove or edit by hand your $KDEHOME / share/ config/ kickerrc file, where $KDEHOME is usually ~/. kde. If you choose to edit it by hand, start by removing the applet entry groups.
Where did the Icon Zooming option that used to be in & kicker; go?
Icon zooming was not actively maintained and had caused severe bugs and usability issues. It was replaced in & kde; 3.4 by the new mouse over effects, which combine esthetics with useful information.
How can I start an application minimized to the system tray?
Use ksystraycmd. For example, to start a & konsole; hidden in the system tray, run ksystraycmd --hidden konsole. For more information about ksystraycmd, see the section Advanced Window Management in the & kde; User Guide.
How do I use the & Windows; key to open the & kmenu;?
Previous versions of & kde; provided a trick to allow you to use the & Windows; key both as a modifier (so you could have shortcuts like Win R), and as a regular key (so that pressing Win on its own could open the & kmenu;). This feature was removed for reasons of usability and accessibility, as well as keeping the code clean. For current versions of & kde;, you have two options: either use a different shortcut to open the & kmenu; (the default is Alt; F1), or remap the Win key to be a regular key, rather than a modifier.
If you choose to do the second, here's one way:
Find the keycode for your Win key using xev: Run the command xev in a & konsole;, and press the Win key. Look in the output of xev for keycode n, where n is the keycode of the Win key.
Use xmodmap to remap the Win key. An appropriate command is xmodmap -e'keycode n =Menu '.
In the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Regional & Accessibility Keyboard Shortcuts and set the shortcut for Popup Launch Menu to the Win key. You should now be able to popup the & kmenu; by pressing the Win key.
One more step is required to save the changes across settings: Create a file ~/. kde/ env/ win-key. sh (create the directory if it does n't exist), and add the xmodmap command you used previously to it. The change should now be applied every time you start & kde;.
