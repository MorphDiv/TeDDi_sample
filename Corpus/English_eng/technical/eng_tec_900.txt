Special Settings

Special Settings
Specifies the way you can work with data in a database.
Edit - Database - Advanced Settings
The availability of the following controls depends on the type of database:
Use SQL-92 naming constraints
Only allows characters that conform to the SQL-92 naming convention in a name in a data source.
All other characters are rejected.
Each name must begin with a lowercase letter, an uppercase letter, or an underscore ( _ ).
The remaining characters can be ASCII letters, numbers, and underscores.
End text lines with CR + LF
Select to use the CR + LF code pair to end every text line (preferred for DOS and Windows operating systems).
Append the table alias name in SELECT statements
Appends the alias to the table name in SELECT statements.
Use Outer Join syntax '{OJ }'
Use escape sequences for outer joins.
The syntax for this escape sequence is {oj outer-join}
Example:
select Article.* from {oj item LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON item.no=orders.ANR}
Ignore the privileges from the database driver
Ignores access privileges that are provided by the database driver.
Replace named parameters with ?
Replaces named parameters in a data source with a question mark (?).
Display version columns (when available)
Displays the internal version number of the record in the database table.
Use the catalogue name in SELECT statements
Uses the current data source of the catalogue.
This option is useful when the ODBC data source is a database server.
Do not select this option if the ODBC data source is a dBASE driver.
Use the schema name in SELECT statements
Allows you to use the schema name in SELECT statements.
Create index with ASC or DESC statement
Creates an index with ASC or DESC statements.
Comparison of Boolean values
Select the type of Boolean comparison that you want to use.
Form data input checks for required fields
When you enter a new record or update an existing record in a form, and you leave a field empty which is bound to a database column which requires input, then you will see a message complaining about the empty field.
If this control box is not enabled, then the forms in the current database will not be checked for required fields.
The control box is available for all data source types which support write access to their data.
The control box does not exist for spreadsheets, text, csv, and the various read-only address books.
Ignore currency field information
Only for Oracle JDBC connections.
When enabled it specifies that no column is treated as a currency field.
The field type returned from the database driver is discarded.
Use ODBC conformant date/time literals
Mark to use ODBC conformant date/time literals.
