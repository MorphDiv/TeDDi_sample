PHP Manual

(PHP 3 = 3.0.3, PHP 4)
Opens a connection to a Hyperwave server and returns a connection index on success, or FALSE if the connection could not be made.
Each of the arguments should be a quoted string, except for the port number.
The username and password arguments are optional and can be left out.
In such a case no identification with the server will be done.
It is similar to identify as user anonymous.
This function returns a connection index that is needed by other Hyperwave functions.
You can have multiple connections open at once.
Keep in mind, that the password is not encrypted.
See also hw_pconnect().
