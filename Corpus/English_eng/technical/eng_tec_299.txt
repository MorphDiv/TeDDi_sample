Adding Clickable Hotspots to Images
An ImageMap allows you to attach URLs to specific areas, called hotspots, on a picture in your document.
An image map is a group of one or more hotspots.
You can draw three types of hotspots: rectangles, ellipses, and polygons.
When you click a hotspot, the URL is opened in the browser window or frame that you specify.
You can also specify the text that appears when your mouse rests on the hotspot.
To add a clickable hotspot to an image
Position the cursor where you want the ImageMap in your document.
Insert - Picture - From File
, select and insert a bitmap picture.
Edit - ImageMap
.
You will see the
ImageMap Editor
, which displays the picture at the background.
Use the icons in the ImageMap Editor to draw a hotspot shape, for example a rectangle, over the image at the background.
Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - General
.
Enter the &quot; Address &quot; URL that will be shown in a Web browser when the user clicks the hotspot.
Optionally, enter the &quot; Text &quot; that will be shown as a tip when the user points the mouse to the hotspot.
Click the Apply button to apply your changes, and close the ImageMap Editor.
Save the document in the %PRODUCTNAME or HTML format.
You may save the ImageMap as a file and upload that file to a Web server, for example.
