Name
Shortcuts
None
In this module you can configure the web shortcuts feature. Web shortcuts allow you to quickly search or lookup words on the Internet. For example, to search for information about the KDE project using the Google engine, you simply type gg: KDE or google: KDE. If you select a default search engine, normal words or phrases will be looked up at the specified search engine by simply typing them into applications, such as Konqueror, that have built-in support for such a feature.
Search Filters
Enable shortcuts that allow you to quickly search for information on the web. For example, entering the shortcut gg: KDE will result in a search for the word KDE on the Google(TM) search engine.

Select the search engine to use for input boxes that provide automatic lookup services when you type in normal words and phrases instead of a URL. To disable this feature select None from the list.
Default & search engine:
Choose the delimiter that separates the keyword from the phrase or word to be searched.
& Keyword delimiter:
Colon
Space
Enter the human-readable name of the search provider here.
Search & provider name:
Enter the URI that is used to perform a search on the search engine here. The whole text to be searched for can be specified as \\{@} or \\{0}. Recommended is \\{@}, since it removes all query variables (name=value) from the resulting string, whereas \\{0} will be substituted with the unmodified query string. You can use \\{1}... \\{n} to specify certain words from the query and \\{name} to specify a value given by'name=value 'in the user query. In addition it is possible to specify multiple references (names, numbers and strings) at once (\\{name1, name2,..., "string"}). The first matching value (from the left) will be used as the substitution value for the resulting URI. A quoted string can be used as the default value if nothing matches from the left of the reference list.
Search & URI:
The shortcuts entered here can be used as a pseudo-URI scheme in KDE. For example, the shortcut av can be used as in av: my search
URI shortcuts:
Select the character set that will be used to encode your search query

The URI does not contain a \\{...} placeholder for the user query. This means that the same page is always going to be visited, regardless of what the user types.
