& ksig; is an application specially designed to manage multiple email signatures graphically.

Introduction
& ksig; is a graphical tool for keeping track of many different email signatures. The signatures themselves can be edited through & ksig; apos; s graphical user interface. A command-line interface is then available for generating random or daily signatures from a list. The command-line interface makes a suitable plugin for generating signatures in external mail clients such as & kmail;.
Random signatures will pull signatures from the & ksig; signature file randomly. You can make every email more exiciting and unique than the previous by creating multiple signatures with varying quotes, styles, and information.
Daily signatures will pull signatures from the & ksig; signature file only using one signature for an entire day. Every day will provide a different signature, and just like the random signatures provide uniqueness to your emails.
Please report any problems or feature requests to the & kde; mailing lists.
Using & ksig;
Go to KMenu Utilities PIM ksig; Signature Editor

Creating a new signature
To create a new signature, go to Ctrl; N File New. This will create an lt; empty signaturegt; in the Signatures section. Left click the & lt; empty signaturegt; and in the bottom section type in your new signature. Signature example Mr. Konqi konqi@kde. org http: / /www. kde. org Once you have completed your signature, save it by going to Ctrl; S File Save, or by pressing the Save button (floppy disc icon).
You can create as many signatures as you would like. Doing so provides you with a list of signatures to use in email applications such as & kmail;, so no matter how informal or professional you need to be, there will always be an available signature.
Deleting a signature
To remove a signature first select the signature that you want to remove and then click File Remove, or by clicking the Remove button with the red x icon in the toolbar.
Adding daily signatures to & kmail;
Adding a daily signature is pretty straight forward. Open & kmail; by pressing Alt; F2. Enter kmail in the text box and then press Run. Once inside & kmail;, go to Settings Configure KMail.... In the Identities selection, highlight the identity to add the signature to and then press the Modify... button on the right-hand side of the window. Select the Signature tab. Check the Enable signature box. From the Obtain signature text from drop down, select Output of Command. In the Specify command text box, enter ksig --daily and then press the OK button.
Adding random signatures to & kmail;

Once inside & kmail;, go to Settings Configure KMail.... In the Identities selection, highlight the identity to add the signature to and then press the Modify... button on the right-hand side of the window. Select the Signature tab.
