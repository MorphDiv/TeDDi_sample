Printing Information
Next
You can also print execution information, such as the current file being executed.
The name of the function currently being executed can be retrieved using the function get_active_function_name().
This function returns a pointer to the function name and doesn 't accept any arguments.
To retrieve the name of the file currently being executed, use zend_get_executed_filename().
This function accesses the executor globals, which are passed to it using the TSRMLS_C macro.
The executor globals are automatically available to every function that' s called directly by Zend (they're part of the INTERNAL_FUNCTION_PARAMETERS described earlier in this chapter).
If you want to access the executor globals in another function that doesn' t have them available automatically, call the macro TSRMLS_FETCH() once in that function; this will introduce them to your local scope.
Finally, the line number currently being executed can be retrieved using the function zend_get_executed_lineno().
This function also requires the executor globals as arguments.
For examples of these functions, see Example 36-2.
