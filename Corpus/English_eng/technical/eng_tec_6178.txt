system information
This page displays information about the DMA (Direct Memory Access) Channels. A DMA channel is a direct connection that allows devices to transfer data to and from memory without going through the processor. Typically, i386-architecture systems (PC's) have eight DMA channels (0-7).
The exact information displayed is system-dependent. On some systems, DMA Channel information cannot be displayed yet.
On & Linux;, this information is read from / proc/ dma, which is only available if the / proc pseudo-filesystem is compiled into the kernel.
A list of all currently-registered (ISA bus) DMA channels that are in use is shown. The first column shows the DMA channel, and the second column shows the device which uses that channel.
Unused DMA channels are not listed.
The user cannot modify any settings on this page.
