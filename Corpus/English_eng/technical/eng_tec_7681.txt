ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
ReFacto AF 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 250 IU* moroctocog alfa**.
After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains approximately 62.5 IU moroctocog alfa.
* The potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic assay.
The specific activity of ReFacto AF is 7,600-13,800 IU/ mg protein.
** Human coagulation factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.
Moroctocog alfa is a glycoprotein with 1438 amino acids with a sequence that is comparable to the 90 + 80 kDa form of factor VIII (i. e.
B-domain deleted) and similar post-translational modifications to those of the plasma-derived molecule.
The manufacturing process for ReFacto has been modified to eliminate any exogenous human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, purification, or final formulation; and at the same time the invented name has been changed to ReFacto AF.
Excipients:
After reconstitution, 1.23 mmol (29 mg) sodium per vial.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Powder and solvent for solution for injection.
White to off-white cake/ powder.
Clear, colourless solvent.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ReFacto AF is appropriate for use in adults and children of all ages, including newborns.
ReFacto AF does not contain von Willebrand factor, and hence is not indicated in von Willebrand’ s disease.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia A.
Posology
2 The labelled potency of ReFacto AF is based on the European Pharmacopoeial chromogenic substrate assay, in which the manufacturing potency standard has been calibrated to the WHO International Standard using the chromogenic substrate assay.
When monitoring patients' factor VIII activity levels during treatment with ReFacto AF, use of the European Pharmacopoeial chromogenic substrate assay is strongly recommended.
The chromogenic assay yields results which are higher than those observed with use of the one-stage clotting assay.
Typically, one-stage clotting assay results are 20-50% lower than the chromogenic substrate assay results.
The ReFacto AF laboratory standard can be used to correct for this discrepancy (see section 5.2).
Another moroctocog alfa product approved for use outside Europe has a different potency assigned using a manufacturing potency standard that has been calibrated to the WHO International Standard using a one-stage clotting assay; this product is identified by the tradename XYNTHA.
Due to the difference in methods used to assign product potency of XYNTHA and ReFacto AF, 1 IU of the XYNTHA product (one-stage assay calibrated) is approximately equivalent to 1.38 IU of the ReFacto AF product (chromogenic assay calibrated).
If a patient normally treated with XYNTHA is prescribed ReFacto AF, the treating physician may consider adjustment of dosing recommendations based on factor VIII recovery values.
Based on their current regimen, individuals with haemophilia A should be advised to bring an adequate supply of factor VIII product for anticipated treatment when travelling.
Patients should be advised to consult with their healthcare provider prior to travel.
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of bleeding, and on the patient’ s clinical condition.
Doses administered should be titrated to the patient's clinical response.
In the presence of an inhibitor, higher doses or appropriate specific treatment may be required.
The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IUs), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to the quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based upon the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) of factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dosage is determined using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% or IU/ dl) x 0.5 (IU/ kg per IU/ dl), where 0.5 IU/ kg per IU/ dl represents the reciprocal of the incremental recovery generally observed following infusions of factor VIII.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma levels (in% of normal or in IU/ dl) in the corresponding period.
The following table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:
3 Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure
Factor VIII level required (% or IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of therapy (days)
Haemorrhage
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or oral bleeding
20-40
Repeat every 12-24 hours.
At least 1 day until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or haematoma
30-60
Repeat infusion every 12-24 hours for 3-4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved.
Life-threatening haemorrhages
60-100
Repeat infusion every 8-24 hours until threat is resolved.
Surgery
Minor, including tooth extraction
30-60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80-100 (pre- and post-operative)
Repeat infusion every 8-24 hours until adequate wound healing, then therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% (IU/ dl).
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Patients using factor-VIII replacement therapy are to be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
If expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an assay should be performed to determine if factor VIII inhibitors are present.
Data from clinical trials indicated that if inhibitors are present at levels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BUs), administration of additional antihaemophilic factor may neutralise the inhibitors.
In patients with levels of inhibitor above 10 BU, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered.
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia (see section 4.4).
Special populations
Renal or hepatic impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied in clinical trials.
4 Paediatric patients Safety and efficacy studies with ReFacto have been performed both in previously treated children and adolescents (n=31, ages 8-18 years) and in previously untreated neonates, infants and children (n=101, ages < 1-52 months).
The need for an increased dose relative to that used for adults and older children should be anticipated when treating younger children with ReFacto AF.
In a study of ReFacto in children less than 6 years of age, pharmacokinetic analysis revealed half-life and recovery less than that observed in older children and adults (see section 5.2).
During the clinical trials, children less than 6 years of age on a prophylaxis regimen used an average dose of 50 IU/ kg of ReFacto and experienced an average of 6.1 bleeding episodes per year.
Older children and adults on a prophylaxis regimen used an average dose of 27 IU/ kg and experienced an average of 10 bleeding episodes per year.
In a clinical trial setting the mean dose per infusion of ReFacto for bleeding episodes in children less than 6 years of age was higher than the mean dose administered to older children and adults (51.3 IU/ kg and 29.3 IU/ kg, respectively).
Method of administration
ReFacto AF is administered by intravenous injection over several minutes after reconstitution of the lyophilised powder for injection with sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for injection (provided).
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level.
Appropriate training is recommended for non-healthcare professionals administering the product.
In the interest of patients, it is recommended that every time ReFacto AF is administered, the name and batch number of the product should be recorded.
For reconstitution instructions prior to administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Hypersensitivity to hamster proteins.
4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
The product contains traces of hamster proteins.
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions (including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension) and anaphylaxis.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, administration of ReFacto AF is to be discontinued immediately, and an appropriate treatment must be initiated.
In case of shock, the current medical standards for treatment of shock are to be observed.
Patients are to be advised to discontinue use of the product and contact their physician or seek immediate emergency care, depending on the type and severity of the reaction, if any of these symptoms occur.
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BUs) per ml of plasma using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days.
Inhibitors have been observed in previously treated patients receiving factor VIII products, including ReFacto AF.
Cases of recurrence of inhibitors (low titre) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development.
Patients treated with
5 recombinant coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests (see also section 4.8).
Reports of lack of effect, mainly in prophylaxis patients, have been received in the clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting for ReFacto.
The reported lack of effect with ReFacto has been described as bleeding into target joints, bleeding into new joints or a subjective feeling by the patient of new onset bleeding.
When prescribing ReFacto AF it is important to individually titrate and monitor each patient's factor level in order to ensure an adequate therapeutic response.
In the interest of patient safety, it is recommended that every time ReFacto AF is administered, the name on the carton and batch number of the product are recorded.
Patients can affix one of the peel- off labels found on the vial to document the batch number in their diary or for reporting any side effects.
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 1.23 mmol (29 mg) sodium per vial, to be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII.
Because of the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast- feeding is not available.
Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Factor VIII inhibition
The occurrence of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is well known in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.
As with all coagulation factor VIII products, patients are to be monitored for the development of inhibitors that are to be titrated in Bethesda Units (BUs) using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay.
If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.
In a clinical study with ReFacto AF in previously treated patients (PTPs), the incidence of factor VIII inhibitors was the primary safety endpoint.
Two clinically silent, low-titre, transient inhibitors were observed in 94 patients with a median exposure of 76 exposure days (ED, range 1-92), corresponding to 2.2% of the 89 patients with at least 50 ED.
In a supporting study of ReFacto AF, 1 de novo and 2 recurrent inhibitors (all low-titre, central laboratory determination) were observed in 110 patients; median exposure of 58 ED (range 5-140) and 98 patients had at least 50 ED to ReFacto AF.
Ninety-eight (98) of the original 110 patients continued treatment in a second supportive study and had subsequent extended exposure to ReFacto AF with a median of 169 additional ED (range 9-425).
One (1) additional low-titre de novo inhibitor was observed.
The frequency of inhibitors observed in these studies is within the expected range.
In a clinical study with ReFacto in PTPs, 1 inhibitor was observed in 113 patients.
Also, there have been spontaneous post-marketing reports of high-titre inhibitors involving previously treated patients.
6 There are no clinical data on previously untreated patients (PUPs) with ReFacto AF.
However, clinical trials are planned in previously untreated patients (PUPs) with ReFacto AF.
In a clinical trial, 32 out of 101 (32%) previously untreated patients (PUPs) treated with ReFacto developed inhibitors:
16 out of 101 (16%) with a titre > 5 BU and 16 out of 101 (16%) with a titre ≤ 5 BU.
The median number of exposure days up to inhibitor development in these patients was 12 (range 3-49).
Of the 16 patients with high titres, 15 received immune tolerance (IT) treatment.
Of the 16 patients with low titres, IT treatment was started in 10.
IT had an efficacy of 73% for patients with high titres and 90% for those with low titres.
For all 101 treated PUPs, regardless of inhibitor development, the median number of exposure days is 197 (range 1-1299).
Adverse reactions based on experience from clinical trials with ReFacto or ReFacto AF are presented in the table below by system organ class.
These frequencies have been estimated on a per-patient basis and are described using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); and uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Surgical and medical procedures
Vascular access complication
One event of cyst in an 11-year old patient and one event described as confusion in a 13-year old patient have been reported as possibly related to ReFacto AF treatment.
7 Safety of ReFacto AF was evaluated in previously treated children and adolescents (n=18, age 12-16 in a study and n=49, age 7-16 in a supporting study).
Although a limited number of children have been studied, there is a tendency for higher frequencies of adverse events in children aged 7-16 as compared to adults.
A clinical trial evaluating use of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) in children less than 6 years of age is on going.
The following adverse events have also been reported for ReFacto: paraesthesia, fatigue, blurred vision, acne, gastritis, gastroenteritis, and pain.
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed infrequently for ReFacto, and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis including shock (see section 4.4).
Trace amounts of hamster protein may be present in ReFacto AF.
Very rarely, development of antibodies to hamster protein has been observed, but there were no clinical sequelae.
In a study of ReFacto, twenty of 113 (18%) PTPs had an increase in anti-CHO antibody titre, without any apparent clinical effect.
If any reaction takes place that is thought to be related to the administration of ReFacto AF, the rate of infusion is to be decreased or the infusion stopped, as dictated by the response of the patient (see section 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII; ATC code:
B02BD02.
ReFacto AF contains B-domain deleted recombinant coagulation factor VIII (moroctocog alfa).
It is a glycoprotein with an approximate molecular mass of 170,000 Da consisting of 1438 amino acids.
ReFacto AF has functional characteristics comparable to those of endogenous factor VIII.
Factor VIII activity is greatly reduced in patients with haemophilia A, and, therefore, replacement therapy is necessary.
When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII binds to the von Willebrand factor present in the patient’ s circulation.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin, and a clot is formed.
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII: C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy, the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
8 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Pharmacokinetic properties of ReFacto, derived from a cross-over study of ReFacto and a plasma- derived FVIII concentrate, using the chromogenic substrate assay (see section 4.2), in 18 previously treated patients are listed in the table below.

In a study in which the potency of ReFacto AF, ReFacto and FVIII activity in patient plasma were measured using the chromogenic substrate assay, ReFacto AF was shown to be bioequivalent to ReFacto.
The ratios of geometric least-square means of ReFacto AF-to-ReFacto were 100.6%, 99.5% and 98.1% for K-value, AUCt and AUC∞ (area under the plasma concentration curve from time zero to infinity), respectively.
The corresponding 90% confidence intervals about the ratios of ReFacto AF to ReFacto geometric means were within the bioequivalence window of 80% to 125%, demonstrating bioequivalence of ReFacto AF to ReFacto.
In a cross-over pharmacokinetic study, the pharmacokinetic parameters for ReFacto AF were determined at baseline and followed-up in 25 previously treated patients (≥ 12 years) after repeated administration of ReFacto AF for six months.
The ratios of geometric least-square means of month 6-to-baseline pharmacokinetic were 107%, 100% and 104% for K-value, AUCt and AUC∞, respectively.
The corresponding 90% confidence intervals about the ratios of month 6-to-baseline for the above pharmacokinetic parameters were within the equivalence window of 80% to 125%.
This indicates no time-dependent changes in the pharmacokinetic properties of ReFacto AF.
In the same study, in which the drug potency of ReFacto AF and a full-length recombinant factor VIII (FLrFVIII) comparator, and the FVIII activity measured in patient plasma samples were all determined using the same one-stage clotting assay at a central laboratory, ReFacto AF was shown to be pharmacokinetically equivalent to FLrFVIII in 30 previously treated patients (≥ 12 years) using the standard bioequivalence approach.
In PUPs, pharmacokinetic parameters of ReFacto were evaluated using the chromogenic assay.
These patients (n=59; median age 10 ± 8.3 months) had a mean incremental recovery at Week 0 of 1.5 ± 0.6 IU/ dl per IU/ kg (range 0.2 to 2.8 IU/ dl per IU/ kg) which was lower than that obtained in PTPs treated with ReFacto at Week 0 with a mean K-value of 2.4 ± 0.4 IU/ dl per IU/ kg (range 1.1 to 3.8 IU/ dl per IU/ kg).
In the PUPs, the mean incremental recovery was stable over time (5 visits during a 2-year period) and ranged from 1.5 to 1.8 IU/ dl per IU/ kg.
Population pharmacokinetic modeling using data from 44 PUPs led to a mean estimated half-life of 8.0 ± 2.2 hours.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.
No investigations on carcinogenic potential or toxicity to reproduction have been conducted.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ReFacto AF is appropriate for use in adults and children of all ages, including newborns.
ReFacto AF does not contain von Willebrand factor, and hence is not indicated in von Willebrand’ s disease.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia A.
Posology
12 The labelled potency of ReFacto AF is based on the European Pharmacopoeial chromogenic substrate assay, in which the manufacturing potency standard has been calibrated to the WHO International Standard using the chromogenic substrate assay.
When monitoring patients' factor VIII activity levels during treatment with ReFacto AF, use of the European Pharmacopoeial chromogenic substrate assay is strongly recommended.
The chromogenic assay yields results which are higher than those observed with use of the one-stage clotting assay.
Typically, one-stage clotting assay results are 20-50% lower than the chromogenic substrate assay results.
The ReFacto AF laboratory standard can be used to correct for this discrepancy (see section 5.2).
Another moroctocog alfa product approved for use outside Europe has a different potency assigned using a manufacturing potency standard that has been calibrated to the WHO International Standard using a one-stage clotting assay; this product is identified by the tradename XYNTHA.
Due to the difference in methods used to assign product potency of XYNTHA and ReFacto AF, 1 IU of the XYNTHA product (one-stage assay calibrated) is approximately equivalent to 1.38 IU of the ReFacto AF product (chromogenic assay calibrated).
If a patient normally treated with XYNTHA is prescribed ReFacto AF, the treating physician may consider adjustment of dosing recommendations based on factor VIII recovery values.
Based on their current regimen, individuals with haemophilia A should be advised to bring an adequate supply of factor VIII product for anticipated treatment when travelling.
Patients should be advised to consult with their healthcare provider prior to travel.
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of bleeding, and on the patient’ s clinical condition.
Doses administered should be titrated to the patient's clinical response.
In the presence of an inhibitor, higher doses or appropriate specific treatment may be required.
The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IUs), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to the quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based upon the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) of factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dosage is determined using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% or IU/ dl) x 0.5 (IU/ kg per IU/ dl), where 0.5 IU/ kg per IU/ dl represents the reciprocal of the incremental recovery generally observed following infusions of factor VIII.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma levels (in% of normal or in IU/ dl) in the corresponding period.
The following table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:
13 Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure
Factor VIII level required (% or IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of therapy (days)
Haemorrhage
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or oral bleeding
20-40
Repeat every 12-24 hours.
At least 1 day until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or haematoma
30-60
Repeat infusion every 12-24 hours for 3-4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved.
Life-threatening haemorrhages
60-100
Repeat infusion every 8-24 hours until threat is resolved.
Surgery
Minor, including tooth extraction
30-60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80-100 (pre- and post-operative)
Repeat infusion every 8-24 hours until adequate wound healing, then therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% (IU/ dl).
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Patients using factor VIII replacement therapy are to be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
If expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an assay should be performed to determine if factor VIII inhibitors are present.
Data from clinical trials indicated that if inhibitors are present at levels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BUs), administration of additional antihaemophilic factor may neutralise the inhibitors.
In patients with levels of inhibitor above 10 BU, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered.
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia (see section 4.4).
Special populations
Renal or hepatic impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied in clinical trials.
Paediatric patients Safety and efficacy studies with ReFacto have been performed both in previously treated children and adolescents (n=31, ages 8-18 years) and in previously untreated neonates, infants and children (n=101, ages < 1-52 months).
14 The need for an increased dose relative to that used for adults and older children should be anticipated when treating younger children with ReFacto AF.
In a study of ReFacto in children less than 6 years of age, pharmacokinetic analysis revealed half-life and recovery less than that observed in older children and adults (see section 5.2).
During the clinical trials, children less than 6 years of age on a prophylaxis regimen used an average dose of 50 IU/ kg of ReFacto and experienced an average of 6.1 bleeding episodes per year.
Older children and adults on a prophylaxis regimen used an average dose of 27 IU/ kg and experienced an average of 10 bleeding episodes per year.
In a clinical trial setting the mean dose per infusion of ReFacto for bleeding episodes in children less than 6 years of age was higher than the mean dose administered to older children and adults (51.3 IU/ kg and 29.3 IU/ kg, respectively).
Method of administration
ReFacto AF is administered by intravenous injection over several minutes after reconstitution of the lyophilised powder for injection with sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for injection (provided).
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level.
Appropriate training is recommended for non-healthcare professionals administering the product.
In the interest of patients, it is recommended that every time ReFacto AF is administered, the name and batch number of the product should be recorded.
For reconstitution instructions prior to administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Hypersensitivity to hamster proteins.
4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
The product contains traces of hamster proteins.
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions (including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension) and anaphylaxis.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, administration of ReFacto AF is to be discontinued immediately, and an appropriate treatment must be initiated.
In case of shock, the current medical standards for treatment of shock are to be observed.
Patients are to be advised to discontinue use of the product and contact their physician or seek immediate emergency care, depending on the type and severity of the reaction, if any of these symptoms occur.
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BUs) per ml of plasma using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days.
Inhibitors have been observed in previously treated patients receiving factor VIII products, including ReFacto AF.
Cases of recurrence of inhibitors (low titre) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development.
Patients treated with recombinant coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests (see also section 4.8).
Reports of lack of effect, mainly in prophylaxis patients, have been received in the clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting for ReFacto.
The reported lack of effect with ReFacto has been described as bleeding into target joints, bleeding into new joints or a subjective feeling by the patient of new onset
15 bleeding.
When prescribing ReFacto AF it is important to individually titrate and monitor each patient’ s factor level in order to ensure an adequate therapeutic response.
In the interest of patient safety, it is recommended that every time ReFacto AF is administered, the name on the carton and batch number of the product are recorded.
Patients can affix one of the peel- off labels found on the vial to document the batch number in their diary or for reporting any side effects.
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 1.23 mmol (29 mg) sodium per vial, to be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII.
Because of the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast- feeding is not available.
Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Factor VIII inhibition
The occurrence of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is well known in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.
As with all coagulation factor VIII products, patients are to be monitored for the development of inhibitors that are to be titrated in Bethesda Units (BUs) using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay.
If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.
In a clinical study with ReFacto AF in previously treated patients (PTPs), the incidence of factor VIII inhibitors was the primary safety endpoint.
Two clinically silent, low-titre, transient inhibitors were observed in 94 patients with a median exposure of 76 exposure days (ED, range 1-92), corresponding to 2.2% of the 89 patients with at least 50 ED.
In a supporting study of ReFacto AF, 1 de novo and 2 recurrent inhibitors (all low-titre, central laboratory determination) were observed in 110 patients; median exposure of 58 ED (range 5-140) and 98 patients had at least 50 ED to ReFacto AF.
Ninety-eight (98) of the original 110 patients continued treatment in a second supportive study and had subsequent extended exposure to ReFacto AF with a median of 169 additional ED (range 9-425).
One (1) additional low-titre de novo inhibitor was observed.
The frequency of inhibitors observed in these studies is within the expected range.
In a clinical study with ReFacto in PTPs, 1 inhibitor was observed in 113 patients.
Also, there have been spontaneous post-marketing reports of high-titre inhibitors involving previously treated patients.
There are no clinical data on previously untreated patients (PUPs) with ReFacto AF.
However, clinical trials are planned in previously untreated patients (PUPs) with ReFacto AF.
In a clinical trial, 32 out of 101 (32%) previously untreated patients (PUPs) treated with ReFacto developed inhibitors:
16 out of 101 (16%) with a titre > 5 BU and 16 out of 101 (16%) with a titre ≤ 5 BU.
The median number of exposure days up to inhibitor development in these patients was 12 (range 3-49).
Of the 16 patients with high titres, 15 received immune tolerance (IT) treatment.
Of the 16 patients with low titres, IT treatment was started in 10.
IT had an efficacy of 73% for patients with high titres and 90% for those
16 with low titres.
For all 101 treated PUPs, regardless of inhibitor development, the median number of exposure days is 197 (range 1-1299).
Adverse reactions based on experience from clinical trials with ReFacto or ReFacto AF are presented in the table below by system organ class.
These frequencies have been estimated on a per-patient basis and are described using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); and uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Vascular access complication
One event of cyst in an 11-year old patient and one event described as confusion in a 13-year old patient have been reported as possibly related to ReFacto AF treatment.
17 Safety of ReFacto AF was evaluated in previously treated children and adolescents (n=18, age 12-16 in a study and n=49, age 7-16 in a supporting study).
Although a limited number of children have been studied, there is a tendency for higher frequencies of adverse events in children aged 7-16 as compared to adults.
A clinical trial evaluating use of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) in children less than 6 years of age is on going.
The following adverse events have also been reported for ReFacto: paraesthesia, fatigue, blurred vision, acne, gastritis, gastroenteritis, and pain.
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, generalized urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed infrequently for ReFacto, and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis including shock (see section 4.4).
Trace amounts of hamster protein may be present ReFacto AF.
Very rarely development of antibodies to hamster protein has been observed, but there were no clinical sequelae.
In a study of ReFacto, twenty of 113 (18%) PTPs had an increase in anti-CHO antibody titre, without any apparent clinical effect.
If any reaction takes place that is thought to be related to the administration of ReFacto AF, the rate of infusion is to be decreased or the infusion stopped, as dictated by the response of the patient (see section 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII; ATC code:
B02BD02.
ReFacto AF contains B-domain deleted recombinant coagulation factor VIII (moroctocog alfa).
It is a glycoprotein with an approximate molecular mass of 170,000 Da consisting of 1438 amino acids.
ReFacto AF has functional characteristics comparable to those of endogenous factor VIII.
Factor VIII activity is greatly reduced in patients with haemophilia A, and, therefore, replacement therapy is necessary.
When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII binds to the von Willebrand factor present in the patient’ s circulation.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin, and a clot is formed.
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII: C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy, the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Pharmacokinetic properties of ReFacto, derived from a cross-over study of ReFacto and a plasma- derived FVIII concentrate, using the chromogenic substrate assay (see section 4.2), in 18 previously treated patients are listed in the table below.

In a study in which the potency of ReFacto AF, ReFacto and FVIII activity in patient plasma were measured using the chromogenic substrate assay, ReFacto AF was shown to be bioequivalent to ReFacto.
The ratios of geometric least-square means of ReFacto AF-to-ReFacto were 100.6%, 99.5% and 98.1% for K-value, AUCt and AUC∞ (area under the plasma concentration curve from time zero to infinity), respectively.
The corresponding 90% confidence intervals about the ratios of ReFacto AF to ReFacto geometric means were within the bioequivalence window of 80% to 125%, demonstrating bioequivalence of ReFacto AF to ReFacto.
In a cross-over pharmacokinetic study, the pharmacokinetic parameters for ReFacto AF were determined at baseline and followed-up in 25 previously treated patients (≥ 12 years) after repeated administration of ReFacto AF for six months.
The ratios of geometric least-square means of month 6-to-baseline pharmacokinetic were 107%, 100% and 104% for K-value, AUCt and AUC∞, respectively.
The corresponding 90% confidence intervals about the ratios of month 6-to-baseline for the above pharmacokinetic parameters were within the equivalence window of 80% to 125%.
This indicates no time-dependent changes in the pharmacokinetic properties of ReFacto AF.
In the same study, in which the drug potency of ReFacto AF and a full-length recombinant factor VIII (FLrFVIII) comparator, and the FVIII activity measured in patient plasma samples were all determined using the same one-stage clotting assay at a central laboratory, ReFacto AF was shown to be pharmacokinetically equivalent to FLrFVIII in 30 previously treated patients (≥ 12 years) using the standard bioequivalence approach.
In PUPs, pharmacokinetic parameters of ReFacto were evaluated using the chromogenic assay.
These patients (n=59; median age 10 ± 8.3 months) had a mean incremental recovery at Week 0 of 1.5 ± 0.6 IU/ dl per IU/ kg (range 0.2 to 2.8 IU/ dl per IU/ kg) which was lower than that obtained in PTPs treated with ReFacto at Week 0 with a mean K-value of 2.4 ± 0.4 IU/ dl per IU/ kg (range 1.1 to 3.8 IU/ dl per IU/ kg).
In the PUPs, the mean incremental recovery was stable over time (5 visits during a 2-year period) and ranged from 1.5 to 1.8 IU/ dl per IU/ kg.
Population pharmacokinetic modeling using data from 44 PUPs led to a mean estimated half-life of 8.0 ± 2.2 hours.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.
No investigations on carcinogenic potential or toxicity to reproduction have been conducted.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ReFacto AF is appropriate for use in adults and children of all ages, including newborns.
ReFacto AF does not contain von Willebrand factor, and hence is not indicated in von Willebrand’ s disease.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia A.
Posology
22 The labelled potency of ReFacto AF is based on the European Pharmacopoeial chromogenic substrate assay, in which the manufacturing potency standard has been calibrated to the WHO International Standard using the chromogenic substrate assay.
When monitoring patients' factor VIII activity levels during treatment with ReFacto AF, use of the European Pharmacopoeial chromogenic substrate assay is strongly recommended.
The chromogenic assay yields results which are higher than those observed with use of the one-stage clotting assay.
Typically, one-stage clotting assay results are 20-50% lower than the chromogenic substrate assay results.
The ReFacto AF laboratory standard can be used to correct for this discrepancy (see section 5.2).
Another moroctocog alfa product approved for use outside Europe has a different potency assigned using a manufacturing potency standard that has been calibrated to the WHO International Standard using a one-stage clotting assay; this product is identified by the tradename XYNTHA.
Due to the difference in methods used to assign product potency of XYNTHA and ReFacto AF, 1 IU of the XYNTHA product (one-stage assay calibrated) is approximately equivalent to 1.38 IU of the ReFacto AF product (chromogenic assay calibrated).
If a patient normally treated with XYNTHA is prescribed ReFacto AF, the treating physician may consider adjustment of dosing recommendations based on factor VIII recovery values.
Based on their current regimen, individuals with haemophilia A should be advised to bring an adequate supply of factor VIII product for anticipated treatment when travelling.
Patients should be advised to consult with their healthcare provider prior to travel.
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of bleeding, and on the patient’ s clinical condition.
Doses administered should be titrated to the patient's clinical response.
In the presence of an inhibitor, higher doses or appropriate specific treatment may be required.
The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IUs), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to the quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based upon the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) of factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dosage is determined using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% or IU/ dl) x 0.5 (IU/ kg per IU/ dl), where 0.5 IU/ kg per IU/ dl represents the reciprocal of the incremental recovery generally observed following infusions of factor VIII.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma levels (in% of normal or in IU/ dl) in the corresponding period.
The following table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:
23 Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure
Factor VIII level required (% or IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of therapy (days)
Haemorrhage
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or oral bleeding
20-40
Repeat every 12-24 hours.
At least 1 day until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or haematoma
30-60
Repeat infusion every 12-24 hours for 3-4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved.
Life-threatening haemorrhages
60-100
Repeat infusion every 8-24 hours until threat is resolved.
Surgery
Minor, including tooth extraction
30-60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80-100 (pre- and post-operative)
Repeat infusion every 8-24 hours until adequate wound healing, then therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% (IU/ dl).
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Patients using factor VIII replacement therapy are to be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
If expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an assay should be performed to determine if factor VIII inhibitors are present.
Data from clinical trials indicated that if inhibitors are present at levels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BUs), administration of additional antihaemophilic factor may neutralise the inhibitors.
In patients with levels of inhibitor above 10 BU, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered.
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia (see section 4.4).
Special populations
Renal or hepatic impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied in clinical trials.
Paediatric patients Safety and efficacy studies with ReFacto have been performed both in previously treated children and adolescents (n=31, ages 8-18 years) and in previously untreated neonates, infants and children (n=101, ages < 1-52 months).
24 The need for an increased dose relative to that used for adults and older children should be anticipated when treating younger children with ReFacto AF.
In a study of ReFacto in children less than 6 years of age, pharmacokinetic analysis revealed half-life and recovery less than that observed in older children and adults (see section 5.2).
During the clinical trials, children less than 6 years of age on a prophylaxis regimen used an average dose of 50 IU/ kg of ReFacto and experienced an average of 6.1 bleeding episodes per year.
Older children and adults on a prophylaxis regimen used an average dose of 27 IU/ kg and experienced an average of 10 bleeding episodes per year.
In a clinical trial setting the mean dose per infusion of ReFacto for bleeding episodes in children less than 6 years of age was higher than the mean dose administered to older children and adults (51.3 IU/ kg and 29.3 IU/ kg, respectively).
Method of administration
ReFacto AF is administered by intravenous injection over several minutes after reconstitution of the lyophilised powder for injection with sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for injection (provided).
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level.
Appropriate training is recommended for non-healthcare professionals administering the product.
In the interest of patients, it is recommended that every time ReFacto AF is administered, the name and batch number of the product should be recorded.
For reconstitution instructions prior to administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Hypersensitivity to hamster proteins.
4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
The product contains traces of hamster proteins.
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions (including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension) and anaphylaxis.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, administration of ReFacto AF is to be discontinued immediately, and an appropriate treatment must be initiated.
In case of shock, the current medical standards for treatment of shock are to be observed.
Patients are to be advised to discontinue use of the product and contact their physician or seek immediate emergency care, depending on the type and severity of the reaction, if any of these symptoms occur.
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BUs) per ml of plasma using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days.
Inhibitors have been observed in previously treated patients receiving factor VIII products, including ReFacto AF.
Cases of recurrence of inhibitors (low titre) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development.
Patients treated with recombinant coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests (see also section 4.8).
Reports of lack of effect, mainly in prophylaxis patients, have been received in the clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting for ReFacto.
The reported lack of effect with ReFacto has been described as bleeding into target joints, bleeding into new joints or a subjective feeling by the patient of new onset
25 bleeding.
When prescribing ReFacto AF it is important to individually titrate and monitor each patient’ s factor level in order to ensure an adequate therapeutic response.
In the interest of patient safety, it is recommended that every time ReFacto AF is administered, the name on the carton and batch number of the product are recorded.
Patients can affix one of the peel- off labels found on the vial to document the batch number in their diary or for reporting any side effects.
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 1.23 mmol (29 mg) sodium per vial, to be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII.
Because of the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast- feeding is not available.
Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Factor VIII inhibition
The occurrence of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is well known in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.
As with all coagulation factor VIII products, patients are to be monitored for the development of inhibitors that are to be titrated in Bethesda Units (BUs) using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay. If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.
In a clinical study with ReFacto AF in previously treated patients (PTPs), the incidence of factor VIII inhibitors was the primary safety endpoint.
Two clinically silent, low-titre, transient inhibitors were observed in 94 patients with a median exposure of 76 exposure days (ED, range 1-92), corresponding to 2.2% of the 89 patients with at least 50 ED.
In a supporting study of ReFacto AF, 1 de novo and 2 recurrent inhibitors (all low-titre, central laboratory determination) were observed in 110 patients; median exposure of 58 ED (range 5-140) and 98 patients had at least 50 ED to ReFacto AF.
Ninety-eight (98) of the original 110 patients continued treatment in a second supportive study and had subsequent extended exposure to ReFacto AF with a median of 169 additional ED (range 9-425).
One (1) additional low-titre de novo inhibitor was observed.
The frequency of inhibitors observed in these studies is within the expected range.
In a clinical study with ReFacto PTPs, 1 inhibitor was observed in 113 patients.
Also, there have been spontaneous post-marketing reports of high-titre inhibitors involving previously treated patients.
There are no clinical data on previously untreated patients (PUPs) with ReFacto AF.
However, clinical trials are planned in previously untreated patients (PUPs) with ReFacto AF.
In a clinical trial, 32 out of 101 (32%) previously untreated patients (PUPs) treated with ReFacto developed inhibitors:
16 out of 101 (16%) with a titre > 5 BU and 16 out of 101 (16%) with a titre ≤ 5 BU.
The median number of exposure days up to inhibitor development in these patients was 12 (range 3-49).
Of the 16 patients with high titres, 15 received immune tolerance (IT) treatment.
Of the 16 patients with low titres, IT
26 treatment was started in 10.
IT had an efficacy of 73% for patients with high titres and 90% for those with low titres.
For all 101 treated PUPs, regardless of inhibitor development, the median number of exposure days is 197 (range 1-1299).
Adverse reactions based on experience from clinical trials with ReFacto or ReFacto AF are presented in the table below by system organ class.
These frequencies have been estimated on a per-patient basis and are described using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); and uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Vascular access complication
One event of cyst in an 11-year old patient and one event described as confusion in a 13-year old patient have been reported as possibly related to ReFacto AF treatment.
27 Safety of ReFacto AF was evaluated in previously treated children and adolescents (n=18, age 12-16 in a study and n=49, age 7-16 in a supporting study).
Although a limited number of children have been studied, there is a tendency for higher frequencies of adverse events in children aged 7-16 as compared to adults. A clinical trial evaluating use of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) in children less than 6 years of age is on going.
The following adverse events have also been reported for ReFacto: paraesthesia, fatigue, blurred vision, acne, gastritis, gastroenteritis, and pain.
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, generalized urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed infrequently for ReFacto, and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis including shock (see section 4.4).
Trace amounts of hamster protein may be present in ReFacto AF.
Very rarely, development of antibodies to hamster protein has been observed, but there were no clinical sequelae.
In a study of ReFacto, twenty of 113 (18%) PTPs had an increase in anti-CHO antibody titre, without any apparent clinical effect.
If any reaction takes place that is thought to be related to the administration of ReFacto AF, the rate of infusion is to be decreased or the infusion stopped, as dictated by the response of the patient (see section 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII; ATC code:
B02BD02.
ReFacto AF contains B-domain deleted recombinant coagulation factor VIII, (moroctocog alfa).
It is a glycoprotein with an approximate molecular mass of 170,000 Da consisting of 1438 amino acids.
ReFacto AF has functional characteristics comparable to those of endogenous factor VIII.
Factor VIII activity is greatly reduced in patients with haemophilia A, and, therefore, replacement therapy is necessary.
When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII binds to the von Willebrand factor present in the patient’ s circulation.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin, and a clot is formed.
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII: C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Pharmacokinetic properties of ReFacto, derived from a cross-over study of ReFacto and a plasma- derived FVIII concentrate, using the chromogenic substrate assay (see section 4.2), in 18 previously treated patients are listed in the table below.

In a study in which the potency of ReFacto AF, ReFacto and FVIII activity in patient plasma were measured using the chromogenic substrate assay, ReFacto AF was shown to be bioequivalent to ReFacto.
The ratios of geometric least-square means of ReFacto AF-to-ReFacto were 100.6%, 99.5% and 98.1% for K-value, AUCt and AUC∞ (area under the plasma concentration curve from time zero infinity), respectively.
The corresponding 90% confidence intervals about the ratios of ReFacto AF to ReFacto geometric means were within the bioequivalence window of 80% to 125%, demonstrating bioequivalence of ReFacto AF to ReFacto.
In a cross-over pharmacokinetic study, the pharmacokinetic parameters for ReFacto AF were determined at baseline and followed-up in 25 previously treated patients (≥ 12 years) after repeated administration of ReFacto AF for six months.
The ratios of geometric least-square means of month 6- to-baseline pharmacokinetic were 107%, 100% and 104% for K-value, AUCt and AUC∞, respectively.
The corresponding 90% confidence intervals about the ratios of month 6-to-baseline for the above pharmacokinetic parameters were within the equivalence window of 80% to 125%.
This indicates no time-dependent changes in the pharmacokinetic properties of ReFacto AF.
In the same study, in which the drug potency of ReFacto AF and a full-length recombinant factor VIII (FLrFVIII) comparator, and the FVIII activity measured in patient plasma samples were all determined using the same one-stage clotting assay at a central laboratory, ReFacto AF was shown to be pharmacokinetically equivalent to FLrFVIII in 30 previously treated patients (≥ 12 years) using the standard bioequivalence approach.
In PUPs, pharmacokinetic parameters of ReFacto were evaluated using the chromogenic assay.
These patients (n=59; median age 10 ± 8.3 months) had a mean incremental recovery at Week 0 of 1.5 ± 0.6 IU/ dl per IU/ kg (range 0.2 to 2.8 IU/ dl per IU/ kg) which was lower than that obtained in PTPs treated with ReFacto at Week 0 with a mean K-value of 2.4 ± 0.4 IU/ dl per IU/ kg (range 1.1 to 3.8 IU/ dl per IU/ kg).
In the PUPs, the mean incremental recovery was stable over time (5 visits during a 2-year period) and ranged from 1.5 to 1.8 IU/ dl per IU/ kg.
Population pharmacokinetic modeling using data from 44 PUPs led to a mean estimated half-life of 8.0 ± 2.2 hours.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.
No investigations on carcinogenic potential or toxicity to reproduction have been conducted.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
ReFacto AF 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 2000 IU* moroctocog alfa**.
After reconstitution, each ml of solution contains approximately 500 IU moroctocog alfa.
* The potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic assay.
The specific activity of ReFacto AF is 7,600-13,800 IU/ mg protein.
** Human coagulation factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
ReFacto AF is appropriate for use in adults and children of all ages, including newborns.
ReFacto AF does not contain von Willebrand factor, and hence is not indicated in von Willebrand’ s disease.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia A.
Posology
32 The labelled potency of ReFacto AF is based on the European Pharmacopoeial chromogenic substrate assay, in which the manufacturing potency standard has been calibrated to the WHO International Standard using the chromogenic substrate assay.
When monitoring patients' factor VIII activity levels during treatment with ReFacto AF, use of the European Pharmacopoeial chromogenic substrate assay is strongly recommended.
The chromogenic assay yields results which are higher than those observed with use of the one-stage clotting assay.
Typically, one-stage clotting assay results are 20-50% lower than the chromogenic substrate assay results.
The ReFacto AF laboratory standard can be used to correct for this discrepancy (see section 5.2).
Another moroctocog alfa product approved for use outside Europe has a different potency assigned using a manufacturing potency standard that has been calibrated to the WHO International Standard using a one-stage clotting assay; this product is identified by the tradename XYNTHA.
Due to the difference in methods used to assign product potency of XYNTHA and ReFacto AF, 1 IU of the XYNTHA product (one-stage assay calibrated) is approximately equivalent to 1.38 IU of the ReFacto AF product (chromogenic assay calibrated).
If a patient normally treated with XYNTHA is prescribed ReFacto AF, the treating physician may consider adjustment of dosing recommendations based on factor VIII recovery values.
Based on their current regimen, individuals with haemophilia A should be advised to bring an adequate supply of factor VIII product for anticipated treatment when travelling.
Patients should be advised to consult with their healthcare provider prior to travel.
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of bleeding, and on the patient’ s clinical condition.
Doses administered should be titrated to the patient's clinical response.
In the presence of an inhibitor, higher doses or appropriate specific treatment may be required.
The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IUs), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to the quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based upon the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) of factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/ dl.
The required dosage is determined using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% or IU/ dl) x 0.5 (IU/ kg per IU/ dl), where 0.5 IU/ kg per IU/ dl represents the reciprocal of the incremental recovery generally observed following infusions of factor VIII.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma levels (in% of normal or in IU/ dl) in the corresponding period.
The following table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:
33 Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure
Factor VIII level required (% or IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of therapy (days)
Haemorrhage
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or oral bleeding
20-40
Repeat every 12-24 hours.
At least 1 day until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or haematoma
30-60
Repeat infusion every 12-24 hours for 3-4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved.
Life-threatening haemorrhages
60-100
Repeat infusion every 8-24 hours until threat is resolved.
Surgery
Minor, including tooth extraction
30-60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80-100 (pre- and post-operative)
Repeat infusion every 8-24 hours until adequate wound healing, then therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% (IU/ dl).
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Patients using factor VIII replacement therapy are to be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
If expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an assay should be performed to determine if factor VIII inhibitors are present.
Data from clinical trials indicated that if inhibitors are present at levels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BUs), administration of additional antihaemophilic factor may neutralise the inhibitors.
In patients with levels of inhibitor above 10 BU, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered.
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia (see section 4.4).
Special populations
Renal or hepatic impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied in clinical trials.
Paediatric patients Safety and efficacy studies with ReFacto have been performed both in previously treated children and adolescents (n=31, ages 8-18 years) and in previously untreated neonates, infants and children (n=101, ages < 1-52 months).
34 The need for an increased dose relative to that used for adults and older children should be anticipated when treating younger children with ReFacto AF.
In a study of ReFacto in children less than 6 years of age, pharmacokinetic analysis revealed half-life and recovery less than that observed in older children and adults (see section 5.2).
During the clinical trials, children less than 6 years of age on a prophylaxis regimen used an average dose of 50 IU/ kg of ReFacto and experienced an average of 6.1 bleeding episodes per year.
Older children and adults on a prophylaxis regimen used an average dose of 27 IU/ kg and experienced an average of 10 bleeding episodes per year.
In a clinical trial setting the mean dose per infusion of ReFacto for bleeding episodes in children less than 6 years of age was higher than the mean dose administered to older children and adults (51.3 IU/ kg and 29.3 IU/ kg, respectively).
Method of administration
ReFacto AF is administered by intravenous injection over several minutes after reconstitution of the lyophilised powder for injection with sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for injection (provided).
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level.
Appropriate training is recommended for non-healthcare professionals administering the product.
In the interest of patients, it is recommended that every time ReFacto AF is administered, the name and batch number of the product should be recorded.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Hypersensitivity to hamster proteins.
4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
The product contains traces of hamster proteins.
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions (including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension) and anaphylaxis.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, administration of ReFacto AF is to be discontinued immediately, and an appropriate treatment must be initiated.
In case of shock, the current medical standards for treatment of shock are to be observed.
Patients are to be advised to discontinue use of the product and contact their physician or seek immediate emergency care, depending on the type and severity of the reaction, if any of these symptoms occur.
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BUs) per ml of plasma using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days.
Inhibitors have been observed in previously treated patients receiving factor VIII products, including ReFacto AF.
Cases of recurrence of inhibitors (low titre) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development.
Patients treated with recombinant coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests (see also section 4.8).
Reports of lack of effect, mainly in prophylaxis patients, have been received in the clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting for ReFacto.
The reported lack of effect with ReFacto has been described as bleeding into target joints, bleeding into new joints or a subjective feeling by the patient of new onset bleeding.
When prescribing ReFacto AF it is important to individually titrate and monitor each patient’ s factor level in order to ensure an adequate therapeutic response.
35 In the interest of patient safety, it is recommended that every time ReFacto AF is administered, the name on the carton and batch number of the product are recorded.
Patients can affix one of the peel- off labels found on the vial to document the batch number in their diary or for reporting any side effects.
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 1.23 mmol (29 mg) sodium per vial, to be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII.
Because of the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast- feeding is not available.
Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Factor VIII inhibition
The occurrence of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is well known in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.
As with all coagulation factor VIII products, patients are to be monitored for the development of inhibitors that are to be titrated in Bethesda Units (BUs) using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay.
If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.
In a clinical study with ReFacto AF in previously treated patients (PTPs), the incidence of factor VIII inhibitors was the primary safety endpoint.
Two clinically silent, low-titre, transient inhibitors were observed in 94 patients with a median exposure of 76 exposure days (ED, range 1-92), corresponding to 2.2% of the 89 patients with at least 50 ED.
In a supporting study of ReFacto AF, 1 de novo and 2 recurrent inhibitors (all low-titre, central laboratory determination) were observed in 110 patients; median exposure of 58 ED (range 5-140) and 98 patients had at least 50 ED to ReFacto AF.
Ninety-eight (98) of the original 110 patients continued treatment in a second supportive study and had subsequent extended exposure to ReFacto AF with a median of 169 additional ED (range 9-425).
One (1) additional low-titre de novo inhibitor was observed.
The frequency of inhibitors observed in these studies is within the expected range.
In a clinical study with ReFacto in PTPs, 1 inhibitor was observed in 113 patients.
Also, there have been spontaneous post-marketing reports of high-titre inhibitors involving previously treated patients.
There are no clinical data on previously untreated patients (PUPs) with ReFacto AF.
However, clinical trials are planned in previously untreated patients (PUPs) with ReFacto AF.
In a clinical trial, 32 out of 101 (32%) previously untreated patients (PUPs) treated with ReFacto developed inhibitors:
16 out of 101 (16%) with a titre > 5 BU and 16 out of 101 (16%) with a titre ≤ 5 BU.
The median number of exposure days up to inhibitor development in these patients was 12 (range 3-49).
Of the 16 patients with high titres, 15 received immune tolerance (IT) treatment.
Of the 16 patients with low titres, IT treatment was started in 10.
IT had an efficacy of 73% for patients with high titres and 90% for those with low titres.
For all 101 treated PUPs, regardless of inhibitor development, the median number of exposure days is 197 (range 1-1299).
36 Adverse reactions based on experience from clinical trials with ReFacto or ReFacto AF are presented in the table below by system organ class.
These frequencies have been estimated on a per-patient basis and are described using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); and uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Vascular access complication
One event of cyst in an 11-year old patient and one event described as confusion in a 13-year old patient have been reported as possibly related to ReFacto AF treatment.
Safety of ReFacto AF was evaluated in previously treated children and adolescents (n=18, age 12-16 in a study and n=49, age 7-16 in a supporting study).
Although a limited number of children have been studied, there is a tendency for higher frequencies of adverse events in children aged 7-16 as compared
37 to adults.
A clinical trial evaluating use of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) in children less than 6 years of age is on going.
The following adverse events have also been reported for ReFacto: paraesthesia, fatigue, blurred vision, acne, gastritis, gastroenteritis, and pain.
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, generalized urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed infrequently for ReFacto, and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis including shock (see section 4.4).
Trace amounts of hamster protein may be present in ReFacto AF.
Very rarely, development of antibodies to hamster protein has been observed, but there were no clinical sequelae.
In a study of ReFacto, twenty of 113 (18%) PTPs had an increase in anti-CHO antibody titre, without any apparent clinical effect.
If any reaction takes place that is thought to be related to the administration of ReFacto AF, the rate of infusion is to be decreased or the infusion stopped, as dictated by the response of the patient (see section 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII; ATC code:
B02BD02.
ReFacto AF contains B-domain deleted recombinant coagulation factor VIII, (moroctocog alfa).
It is a glycoprotein with an approximate molecular mass of 170,000 Da consisting of 1438 amino acids.
ReFacto AF has functional characteristics comparable to those of endogenous factor VIII.
Factor VIII activity is greatly reduced in patients with haemophilia A, and, therefore, replacement therapy is necessary.
When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII binds to the von Willebrand factor present in the patient’ s circulation.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin, and a clot is formed.
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII: C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy, the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Pharmacokinetic properties of ReFacto, derived from a cross-over study of ReFacto and a plasma- derived FVIII concentrate, using the chromogenic substrate assay (see section 4.2), in 18 previously treated patients are listed in the table below.

In a study in which the potency of ReFacto AF, ReFacto and FVIII activity in patient plasma were measured using the chromogenic substrate assay, ReFacto AF was shown to be bioequivalent to ReFacto.
The ratios of geometric least-square means of ReFacto AF-to-ReFacto were 100.6%, 99.5% and 98.1% for K-value, AUCt and AUC∞ (area under the plasma concentration curve from time zero to infinity), respectively.
The corresponding 90% confidence intervals about the ratios of ReFacto AF to ReFacto geometric means were within the bioequivalence window of 80% to 125%, demonstrating bioequivalence of ReFacto AF to ReFacto.
In a cross-over pharmacokinetic study, the pharmacokinetic parameters for ReFacto AF were determined at baseline and followed-up in 25 previously treated patients (≥ 12 years) after repeated administration of ReFacto AF for six months.
The ratios of geometric least-square means of month 6- to-baseline pharmacokinetic were 107%, 100% and 104% for K-value, AUCt and AUC∞, respectively.
The corresponding 90% confidence intervals about the ratios of month 6-to-baseline for the above pharmacokinetic parameters were within the equivalence window of 80% to 125%.
This indicates no time-dependent changes in the pharmacokinetic properties of ReFacto AF.
In the same study, in which the drug potency of ReFacto AF and a full-length recombinant factor VIII (FLrFVIII) comparator, and the FVIII activity measured in patient plasma samples were all determined using the same one-stage clotting assay at a central laboratory, ReFacto AF was shown to be pharmacokinetically equivalent to FLrFVIII in 30 previously treated patients (≥ 12 years) using the standard bioequivalence approach.
In PUPs, pharmacokinetic parameters of ReFacto were evaluated using the chromogenic assay.
These patients (n=59; median age 10 ± 8.3 months) had a mean incremental recovery at Week 0 of 1.5 ± 0.6 IU/ dl per IU/ kg (range 0.2 to 2.8 IU/ dl per IU/ kg) which was lower than that obtained in PTPs treated with ReFacto at Week 0 with a mean K-value of 2.4 ± 0.4 IU/ dl per IU/ kg (range 1.1 to 3.8 IU/ dl per IU/ kg).
In the PUPs, the mean incremental recovery was stable over time (5 visits during a 2-year period) and ranged from 1.5 to 1.8 IU/ dl per IU/ kg.
Population pharmacokinetic modeling using data from 44 PUPs led to a mean estimated half-life of 8.0 ± 2.2 hours.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.
No investigations on carcinogenic potential or toxicity to reproduction have been conducted.

Further information
1.
WHAT REFACTO AF IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
ReFacto AF contains the active substance moroctocog alfa, human coagulation factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology.
Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings.
In patients with haemophilia A (inborn factor VIII deficiency), it is missing or not working properly.
ReFacto AF is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding (prophylaxis) in adults and children of all ages (including newborns) with haemophilia A.
ReFacto AF does not contain von Willebrand factor, and hence is not indicated in von Willebrand’s disease.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE REFACTO AF
Do not use ReFacto AF
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to moroctocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of ReFacto
AF (listed in section 6).
- if you are hypersensitive to hamster proteins.
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.
Take special care with ReFacto AF
70
- if you experience allergic reactions.
Some of the signs of allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions are
difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, itching, tightness of the chest, wheezing, and low blood pressure.
Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can cause difficulty in swallowing and/or breathing, red or swollen face and/or hands.
If any of these signs occur, stop the infusion immediately and contact a doctor or seek immediate emergency care.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative therapy must be considered.
- if your bleeding does not stop as expected and contact your doctor or seek immediate
emergency care.
- if bleeding is not adequately controlled with the usual dose.
Patients receiving factor VIII
products may sometimes develop antibodies to factor VIII (also known as factor VIII inhibitors), which may prevent the factor VIII product from working properly.
While being treated with ReFacto AF, you should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
- if you are elderly.
Your doctor may change the dose.
Taking other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, or have recently taken, any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.
Your doctor will decide if ReFacto AF may be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Important information about some of the ingredients of ReFacto AF
This medicinal product contains 1.23 mmol (or 29 mg) sodium per vial of reconstituted powder.Inform your doctor if you are on a controlled sodium diet.
3.
HOW TO USE REFACTO AF
Always take ReFacto AF exactly as your doctor has instructed you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Your doctor will decide the dose of ReFacto AF you will receive.
This dose and duration will depend upon your individual needs for replacement factor VIII therapy.
During your treatment, your doctor may decide to change the dose of ReFacto AF you receive.
Consult with your health care provider before you travel.
You should bring enough of your factor VIII product for anticipated treatment when travelling.
It is recommended that every time you use ReFacto AF, you record the name on the carton and batch number of the product.

Reconstitution and administration
71 The procedures below are provided as guidelines for the reconstitution and administration of ReFacto AF.
Patients should follow the specific reconstitution and administration procedures provided by their doctors.
Use only the pre-filled syringe provided in the box for reconstitution.
Other sterile disposable syringes may be used for administration.
ReFacto AF is administered by intravenous (IV) injection after reconstitution of the lyophilised powder for injection with the supplied solvent [sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution] syringe.
ReFacto AF should not be mixed with other infusion solutions.
Always wash your hands before performing the following reconstitution and administration procedures.
Aseptic technique (meaning clean and germ-free) should be used during the reconstitution procedure.
Reconstitution:
1.
Allow the vial of lyophilised ReFacto AF and the pre-filled solvent syringe to reach room temperature.
2.
Remove the plastic flip-top cap from the ReFacto AF vial to expose the central portion of the rubber stopper.
3.
Wipe the top of the vial with the alcohol swab provided, or use another antiseptic solution and allow to dry.
After cleaning, do not touch the rubber stopper with your hand or allow it to touch any surface.
4.
Peel back the lid from the clear plastic vial adapter package.
Do not remove the adapter from the package.
5.
Place the vial on a flat surface.
While holding the adapter package, place the vial adapter over the vial.
Press down firmly on the package until the adapter snaps into place on top of the vial, with the adapter spike penetrating the vial stopper.
72 6.
Lift the package away from the adapter and discard the package.
7.
Attach the plunger rod to the solvent syringe by inserting the rod into the opening in the syringe stopper and pushing and turning the rod firmly until it is securely seated in the stopper.
8.
Break off the tamper-resistant plastic tip cap from the solvent syringe by snapping the perforation of the cap.
This is done by bending the cap up and down until the perforation is broken.
Do not touch the inside of the cap or the syringe tip.
The cap may need to be replaced (if not administering reconstituted ReFacto AF immediately), so set it aside by placing it on its top.
9.
Place the vial on a flat surface.
Connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by inserting the tip of the syringe into the adapter opening while firmly pushing and turning the syringe clockwise until the connection is secured.
73 10.
Slowly depress the plunger rod to inject all the solvent into the ReFacto AF vial.
11.
With the syringe still connected to the adapter, gently rotate the vial until the powder is dissolved.
12.
The final solution must be inspected visually for particulate matter before administration.
The solution will appear clear to slightly opalescent and colourless.
Note:
If you use more than one vial of ReFacto AF per infusion, each vial should be reconstituted as per the previous instructions.
The solvent syringe should be removed, leaving the vial adapter in place, and a single large luer lock syringe may be used to draw back the reconstituted contents of each of the individual vials.
13.
Ensuring that the syringe plunger rod is still fully depressed, invert the vial.
Slowly draw back all the solution through the vial adapter into the syringe.
14.
Detach the syringe from the vial adapter by gently pulling and turning the syringe counter- clockwise.
Discard the vial with the adapter attached.
Note:
If the solution is not to be used immediately, the syringe cap is to be carefully replaced.
Do not touch the syringe tip or the inside of the cap.
ReFacto AF must be used within 3 hours of reconstitution.
The reconstituted solution may be stored at room temperature prior to administration.
Administration (Intravenous Injection):
ReFacto AF should be administered using the infusion set provided in this kit and the pre-filled solvent syringe provided or a single sterile disposable plastic luer lock syringe.
1.
Attach the syringe to the luer end of the infusion set tubing.
74 2.
Apply a tourniquet and prepare the injection site by wiping the skin well with an alcohol swab provided in the kit.
3.
Insert the needle on the infusion set tubing into the vein as instructed by your doctor, and remove the tourniquet.
Remove any air in the infusion set tubing by drawing back on the syringe.
The reconstituted product is to be injected intravenously over several minutes.
Your doctor may change your recommended infusion rate to make the infusion more comfortable.
Please dispose of all unused solution, the empty vial(s) and the used needles and syringes in an appropriate container for throwing away of medical waste as these materials may hurt others if not disposed of properly.
If you take more ReFacto AF than you should
Check with your doctor or pharmacist.
If you stop taking ReFacto AF
Do not stop using ReFacto AF without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions regarding this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, ReFacto AF can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Inhibitor development
Patients with haemophilia A may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII.
If such inhibitors occur, a sign may be an increase in the amount of ReFacto AF typically required to treat a bleed and/or continued bleeding after a treatment.
In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.
Your doctor may want to monitor you for inhibitor development.
Development of inhibitors occurred in approximately 2% of patients receiving ReFacto AF in a research study.
If you experience a significant increase in your usage of ReFacto AF in order to control a bleed, please contact your doctor immediately.
Side effects may occur with certain frequencies, which are defined as follows: • very common: affects more than 1 user in 10 • common: affects 1 to 10 users in 100 • uncommon: affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000 • rare: affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000
75 • very rare: affects less than 1 user in 10,000 • not known: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data.
Very common side effects • Vomiting • Inhibitor development for patients who have never been previously treated with factor VIII products
Common side effects • Bleeding • Inhibitor development for patients who have been previously treated with factor VIII products • headache, nausea • joint pain, muscular pain • fatigue, fever • venous access catheter complications
Uncommon side effects
• Severe allergic reaction, dizziness, light-headedness, hives, itching, rash • chest pain, shortness of breath, rapid heart beat • diarrhoea, loss of appetite, stomach pain • altered taste • chills, sweating, muscle weakness • sleepiness • coughing • injection site reactions (including burning and stinging at the infusion site), discomfort and swelling at the intravenous site • slight increase in heart enzymes • increased liver enzymes, increased bilirubin
The following adverse reactions have also been reported: numbness, blurred vision, acne, gastroenteritis, and pain.
Hypersensitivity/allergic reactions
If severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur, the injection must be stopped immediately.
You must contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early symptoms of allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions: • rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching • swelling of lips and tongue • difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest • general feeling of being unwell • dizziness and loss of consciousness
Severe symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (nearly) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment.
If you are concerned about any side effects, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

79 ANNEX IV
GROUNDS FOR ONE ADDITIONAL RENEWAL
80 GROUNDS FOR ONE ADDITIONAL RENEWAL
Based upon the data that have become available since the granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance of ReFacto AF remains positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely monitored for the following reasons:
• to ensure appropriate monitoring of the introduction of the new Refacto AF on the market • to ensure appropriate implementation of the pharmacovigilance system / risk management plan
The CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to submit 6 monthly PSURs.
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Refacto AF, which requires the submission of 6 monthly PSURs, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 years time.
