Debconf is not confident this error message was displayed, so it mailed it to you.

Configuring %s
TERM is not set, so the dialog frontend is not usable.
Dialog frontend is incompatible with emacs shell buffers
Dialog frontend will not work on a dumb terminal, an emacs shell buffer, or without a controlling terminal.
No usable dialog-like program is installed, so the dialog based frontend cannot be used.
Dialog frontend requires a screen at least 13 lines tall and 31 columns wide.
Package configuration
You are using the editor-based debconf frontend to configure your system. See the end of this document for detailed instructions.
The editor-based debconf frontend presents you with one or more text files to edit. This is one such text file. If you are familiar with standard unix configuration files, this file will look familiar to you -- it contains comments interspersed with configuration items. Edit the file, changing any items as necessary, and then save it and exit. At that point, debconf will read the edited file, and use the values you entered to configure the system.
Debconf on %s
This frontend requires a controlling tty.
Term::ReadLine::GNU is incompatable with emacs shell buffers.
