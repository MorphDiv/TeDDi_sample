Creates a PO template file from a DocBook XML file.
xml2pot original-XML
Description
xml2pot is a command-line tool that produces a gettext message template file from the DocBook XML file original-XML. The template file is sent to standard output.
The resulting template file can be used to create gettext message files (PO-files) for a variety of languages. These can then be used in conjunction with po2xml (1) to translate the original XML file into these other languages.
This utility is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.
