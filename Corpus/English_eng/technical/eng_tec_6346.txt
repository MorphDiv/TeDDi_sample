Konqueror Behavior You can configure how Konqueror behaves as a file manager here.
Misc Options
Open folders in separate & windows
If this option is checked, Konqueror will open a new window when you open a folder, rather than showing that folder's contents in the current window.
Show'Delete 'context menu entries which bypass the trashcan
Check this if you want'Delete 'menu commands to be displayed on the desktop and in the file manager's context menus. You can always delete files by holding the Shift key while calling'Move to Trash'.
Paths This module allows you to choose where in the filesystem the files on your desktop should be stored. Use the "Whats This?" (Shift+F1) to get help on specific options.
Desktop path:
This folder contains all the files which you see on your desktop. You can change the location of this folder if you want to, and the contents will move automatically to the new location as well.
Autostart path:
This folder contains applications or links to applications (shortcuts) that you want to have started automatically whenever KDE starts. You can change the location of this folder if you want to, and the contents will move automatically to the new location as well.
Documents path:
This folder will be used by default to load or save documents from or to.
Downloads path:
This folder will be used by default to save your downloaded items.
Movies path:
This folder will be used by default to load or save movies from or to.
Pictures path:
This folder will be used by default to load or save pictures from or to.
Music path:
This folder will be used by default to load or save music from or to.

Ask Confirmation For
This option tells Konqueror whether to ask for a confirmation when you "delete" a file. Move To Trash: moves the file to your trash folder, from where it can be recovered very easily. Delete: simply deletes the file.

& Behavior
& Previews & & Meta-Data
Allow previews, "Folder Icons Reflect Contents", and retrieval of meta-data on protocols:
Preview Options Here you can modify the behavior of Konqueror when it shows the files in a folder. The list of protocols: check the protocols over which previews should be shown; uncheck those over which they should not. For instance, you might want to show previews over SMB if the local network is fast enough, but you might disable it for FTP if you often visit very slow FTP sites with large images. Maximum File Size: select the maximum file size for which previews should be generated. For instance, if set to 1 MB (the default), no preview will be generated for files bigger than 1 MB, for speed reasons.
Select Protocols
Local Protocols
Internet Protocols
This option makes it possible to choose when the file previews, smart folder icons, and meta-data in the File Manager should be activated. In the list of protocols that appear, select which ones are fast enough for you to allow previews to be generated.
& Maximum file size:
MB
& Increase size of previews relative to icons
& Use thumbnails embedded in files
Select this to use thumbnails that are found inside some file types (e. g. JPEG). This will increase speed and reduce disk usage. Deselect it if you have files that have been processed by programs which create inaccurate thumbnails, such as ImageMagick.

Among other things, this menu has options for configuring the display, locking the screen, and logging out of KDE. Application menu: the "K" menu pops up. This might be useful for quickly accessing applications if you like to keep the panel hidden from view.

Behavior This module allows you to choose various options for your desktop, including the way in which icons are arranged and the pop-up menus associated when clicking on the desktop using the middle and right mouse buttons. Use the "What's This?" (Shift+F1) to get help on specific options.
General
Uncheck this option if you do not want to have icons on the desktop. Without icons the desktop will be somewhat faster but you will no longer be able to drag files to the desktop.
& Show icons on desktop
Check this option if you want to run X11 programs that draw into the desktop such as xsnow, xpenguin or xmountain. If you have problems with applications like netscape that check the root window for running instances, disable this option.

Menu Bar at top of Screen
If this option is selected, there is no menu bar at the top of the screen.
& None
If this option is selected, there is one menu bar at the top of the screen which shows the desktop menus.
& Desktop menu bar
If this option is selected, applications will not have their menu bar attached to their own window anymore. Instead, there is one menu bar at the top of the screen which shows the menus of the currently active application. You might recognize this behavior from Mac OS.

File Icons
Check this option if you want to see your icons automatically aligned to the grid when you move them.
Automatically & line up icons
If you check this option, any files in your desktop directory that begin with a period (.) will be shown. Usually, such files contain configuration information, and remain hidden from view. For example, files which are named ". directory" are plain text files which contain information for Konqueror, such as the icon to use in displaying a directory, the order in which files should be sorted, etc. You should not change or delete these files unless you know what you are doing.
Show & hidden files
Select for which types of files you want to enable preview images.

Here you can control if, when moving the mouse over a file, you want to see a small popup window with additional information about that file
Show & previews in file tips
Here you can control if you want the popup window to contain a larger preview for the file, when moving the mouse over it.
Multiple Desktops In this module, you can configure how many virtual desktops you want and how these should be labeled.
Number of desktops:
Here you can set how many virtual desktops you want on your KDE desktop. Move the slider to change the value.
Desktop & Names

Here you can enter the name for desktop %1

Rename icons inline
Checking this option will allow files to be renamed by clicking directly on the icon name.
& Appearance
& Standard font:
This is the font used to display text in Konqueror windows.
Font size:
This is the font size used to display text in Konqueror windows.
Normal text color:
This is the color used to display text in Konqueror windows.
& Text background color:
This is the color used behind the text for the icons on the desktop.
Height for icon text:
This is the maximum number of lines that can be used to draw icon text. Long file names are truncated at the end of the last line.
& Width for icon text:
This is the maximum width for the icon text when konqueror is used in multi column view mode.
& Underline filenames
Checking this option will result in filenames being underlined, so that they look like links on a web page. Note: to complete the analogy, make sure that single click activation is enabled in the mouse control module.
Display file sizes in bytes
Checking this option will result in file sizes being displayed in bytes. Otherwise file sizes are being displayed in kilobytes or megabytes if appropriate.
Appearance You can configure how Konqueror looks as a file manager here.
& Show network operations in a single window
Checking this option will group the progress information for all network file transfers into a single window with a list. When the option is not checked, all transfers appear in a separate window.
Home & URL:
Select Home Folder
This is the URL (e. g. a folder or a web page) where Konqueror will jump to when the "Home" button is pressed. This is usually your home folder, symbolized by a'tilde '(~).
