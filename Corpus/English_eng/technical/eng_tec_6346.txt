A Quick Start Guide to Adding an Entry to the application launcher
In this example, we will add & firefox; to the Internet submenu.
Most applications can be added with & kappfinder;, & firefox; can usually be added that way, but was used for lack of a better example.
To start off, we need to open & kmenuedit;, so & RMB; on the application launcher menu, click Menu Editor to start & kmenuedit;. After & kmenuedit; has started, select Internet as shown in picture below.
Select Internet
Select Internet
Once you have selected Internet, click on File New Item..., opening the New Item dialog, as shown below. Type the name of the program you want to add, in this case, type firefox.
New Item dialog
The New Item dialog.
Press return, and you should see something like the picture below in the main window.
New Item
The new item created.
Now lets fill in the Description:, in this case type Web Browser. The description and name will be displayed on the application launcher as Web Browser (Firefox). We will need to fill in the executable name in the Command: field, in this instance we will type firefox.
Following the command, you can have several place holders which will be replaced with actual values when the program is run:
%f - a single file name
%F - a list of files; use for applications that can open several local files at once
%u - a single & URL;
%U - a list of & URL; s
%d - the folder of a file to open
%D - a list of folders
%i - the icon
%m - the mini icon
%c - the caption
For example: if you want to firefox to start your web browsing at www. kde. org - instead of firefox you would type firefox %u www. kde. org.
We would like to have a more creative icon, so we will click the generic icon sitting beside Name:. It will bring the Select Icon dialog which will let us choose the new icon, as shown below.
Select Icon dialog
The Select Icon dialog.
We choose the firefox icon from the list, and press return. Your finished screen should probably look something like the screenshot below.
Done screenshot
This is what the completed menu item should looks like.
Click File Save, wait for the Updating System Configuration dialog to get finished, you should find & firefox; in the application launcher Internet submenu!
Using & kmenuedit;
The left application panel shows the application launcher structure. When you browse items in the left panel, the right panel shows detailed information for the highlighted menu item.
General tab
Name:
This is the name of your program as it appears in the application launcher menu. It can be different from the real executable name. For instance the name of mc executable is "Midnight Commander".
Description:
The description will be displayed together with the name in the application launcher. This is entirely optional.
Comment:
Describe the program in greater detail in this field. This is entirely optional.
Command:
This is the name of the executable program. Make sure that you have permission to run the program.
Enable launch feedback
If this box is checked, this will display feedback when an application is started.
Place in system tray
When checked, the application's icon will show up in the panel system tray. You will then be able to hide or show the application by clicking on the system tray icon. Clicking on it using the & RMB; will allow also you to undock, or quit the application.
Only show in & kde;
When checked, the application entry will only be visible in all & kde; application launchers but not in other desktops environments.
Advanced tab
Work path:
Specify the work path of the program. This will be the current path when the program launches. It does not need to be the same as the executable location.
Run in terminal
You must check this if your program requires terminal emulator in order to run. This mainly applies to console applications.
Terminal options:
Put all terminal options in this field.
Run as a different user
If you want to run this program as a different user (not you), check this checkbox, and provide the username in the Username: field.

Click the None button to the right of the Current shortcut key: checkbox.
The button text will change to Input... and you can press the key combination on your keyboard that you want to be assigned to your program.

Glossary
Terminal emulator
Terminal emulator is simply a windowed shell; this is known as command line window in some other environments. If you want to use the shell, you should know at least a few of the system-level commands for your operating system.
Applet
A small application that occupies very little memory and screen space, and at the same time gives you some useful information or provides a control shortcut. For instance the Clock applet shows current time and date (and even a month diary if you click it), and System Monitor applet shows how busy your machine currently is in real-time.
Legacy Application
An X-window application which was not written with & kde; in mind. Such applications run fine in & kde;. However, they are not warned automatically when you shut down your & kde; session. You therefore must not forget to save documents open in these applications before you log out from & kde;.
Additionally, many of these applications do not support copying and pasting from & kde; compliant applications. & Netscape; 4. x browser is a prominent example of such application Some GNOME applications may provide limited interoperability with the & kde;..
Console Application
Application originally written for non-graphic, text oriented environment. Such applications run fine in & kde;. They must run within console emulator, like & konsole;. They are not warned automatically when you shut down your & kde; session. You therefore must not forget to save documents open in these applications before you log out from the & kde;.
Console applications support copying and pasting from & kde; -compliant applications. Simply mark the text in the console application with your mouse, switch to the & kde; -compliant application and press Ctrl; V to paste the text. If you want to copy from & kde; application to a console application, first mark the text with your mouse, press Ctrl; C, switch to the console application and press the middle button on your mouse If your mouse does not have a middle button, you must press left and right button at the same time. This is called middle button emulation and it must be supported by your operating system to work..
