KPlato is a Project Planning and Management application.
Welcome to KPlato. These introductory pages should give you an idea of how to use KPlato and what you can use it for.
A short introduction.
Tips on how to manipulate and inspect data.
A small tutorial to get you started.
Note: To view these pages when you are in other parts of KPlato, choose the menu option Help - > KPlato Introduction.
KPlato is intended for managing moderately large projects with multiple resources. To enable you to model your project adequately, KPlato offers different types of task dependencies and timing constraints. Usually you will define your tasks, estimate the effort needed to perform each task, allocate resources and then schedule the project according to the dependency network and resource availability. You can find more information in the documentation or online at http: / /www. koffice. org/ kplato
Next: Tips
Editing tips.
To edit project data, different views and editors can be selected in the View Selector docker. The views are generally used to inspect data after the project has been scheduled. No data will appear in the views if the project has not been scheduled. Scheduling is done in the Schedules editor. You can edit attributes in the various editors by selecting the item you want to edit (doubleclick or press F2), or open a dialog using the context menu .< ul >
Next: Create a simple project
Create the simplest project ever.
Select the task editor Editors- > Tasks: Create a task by selecting Add Task in the toolbar. Set Estimate Type to Duration. Set Estimate to 8 hours. Set Constraint to As Soon As Possible. Select the schedules editor Editors- > Schedules: Create a schedule by selecting Add Schedule in the toolbar. Calculate the schedule by selecting Calculate in the toolbar. The task should now have been scheduled to start %1 with a duration of 8 hours. You can check this by selecting the gantt chart Views- > Gantt.
Next: Resource allocation
Allocate a resource to the task.
Select the task editor Editors- > Tasks: Enter a name (e. g. 'John ') in the Allocation column. (KPlato will automatically create a resource with name'John' under resource group'Resources'. Set Estimate Type to Effort. Now you need to schedule the project again with the new allocation: Select the schedules editor Editors- > Schedules and calculate the schedule by selecting Calculate in the toolbar. The task should be scheduled to start %1 with a duration of 8 hours. You can check this by selecting the gantt chart Views- > Gantt.

p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Here you define when the project shall start or end. If start time is defined, the project is scheduled forward from this time. When the project has been calculated, end time shows when the project is planned to end. If end time is defined, the project is scheduled backwards from this time. When the project has been calculated, start time shows when the project must start in order to finish in time.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Scheduling Configuration. These settings affect the actual scheduling of the task. The estimation can be either effort based or duration based. If it is effort based, the final duration will depend on the resources assigned to the task. For duration based estimation, the assigned resources do n't affect the fixed duration of the task, but only the costs.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} These values are used when you estimate the effort needed to complete a task.
