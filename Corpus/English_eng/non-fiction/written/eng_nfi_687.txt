Previously on The Americans...
I took some pictures of Pastor Tim's diary.
I didn't want to take the film to Fotomat or anything.
Pastor Tim thinks I might really be screwed up.
He's worried about my soul.
It's a boarding school, so I would live there during school, and then I'd come home vacations.
Henry knows what he wants.
I think he'd be better off.
Where's Mom?
I don't know.
She didn't say where she was going?
I don't think so.
Chris says we're supposed to hear from St. Edwards in the next week or two.
So are you gonna let me go or what?
Henry, if you get in...
I'm gonna have to talk to your mother, but... fine.
It's fine by me.
Thanks, Dad.
Uh, I'm gonna go out.
Tell Mom I'll be back by eight.
How are things going with the Morozovs?
Moving forward.
What about your pastor?
Paige is open to finding a new place for him.
That's very good news.
Yeah.
I'll see what we can do.
The Centre thinks they might have found a woman named Anna Mikhaylovna Prokopchuk, who they've been looking for for years.
A collaborator who was on a Nazi execution squad.
Here?
She personally shot hundreds of our boys.
Prisoners.
They used to line them up around a pit at the edge of town... in Dyatkovo.
Where is she?
Newton, Massachusetts.
Her husband was a medic in the American army.
They met in Germany after the War.
She's been living under the name of Natalie Granholm since the '50s.
But we're not we're not sure it's her?
They can't find any exit documents matching the maiden name she used when she came to America.
And any photos of her were destroyed during the occupation.
Except for this.
The Centre wants you to find out everything you can.
We'll make sure it's her before we do anything.
I looked into what you asked me about.
The Centre did harvest and weaponize the Lassa virus you recovered from William.
They named it Variant V.
For Vitaly.
His Russian name.
Henry asked about St. Edwards again.
I-I said he could go, if it's okay with you.
Which it is.
I think if he wants to go, he should go.
Yeah.
I just thought... he's doing really good now.
All this math stuff.
A girlfriend.
It's all just... working out.
If he gets in, he'll be there for a couple of months, back home, then gone for another couple of months, and back home again...
Yeah.
They like each other.
Good for them.
How many people work here?
Hey, Dennis.
This is my friend Henry Jennings.
You work for the Post?
Hey, you got any idea how many people work here?
Aderholt.
Well, duty calls.
Thanks.
Who's that other guy?
That's Agent Wolfe.
What's that?
That is the vault.
What do you do in there?
Secret stuff.
It's actually a secure room.
What does that mean?
It's got acoustic shielding.
There's no way anyone can possibly listen in on what you're saying in there.
Can we go in?
It's a mail robot.
What does it do?
It delivers mail.
That is so cool!
I got to meet Stan's boss who's the head of counterintelligence, and I met his partner, Dennis they work on cases together.
There was this whole computer room with humongous computers in it, too, and there's this other room, it was called the vault.
Nobody can hear you when you're in there.
What do you mean?
Well, people can't listen in to your conversations.
Me and Stan stopped off at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
I'm gonna go write this while it's still fresh in my head.
Okay.
Who the hell knows.
I think it looks like her.
Think Stan wants Henry to join the FBI?
Maybe.
Matthew certainly isn't cut out for it.
He could clean up and go straight when he gets older.
I think the die's cast with that one.
Do you think Paige wanted us to see those photos?
I don't know.
She already told us.
But... maybe she wanted to see us read them right in front of her.
Or she was just moving too fast.
What does she do?
They have two daughters.
One lives in Portland, Oregon, the other in Boston.
She takes a drawing class.
What else?
She volunteers at a free clinic in Southie.
Takes care of her granddaughter two days a week, in the morning.
She's made a nice life for herself.
How did we find her?
When the Red Army took back Dyatkovo,
Anna Prokopchuk wasn't there.
Turns out she was in a hospital in Germany... getting treatment for a venereal disease, which she got from sleeping with too many Nazi officers.
We didn't know it until last year.
Since then we've been tracking down medical records in the Nazi archives, looking at women with venereal diseases in hospitals in Germany.
They found a woman named Natalya Konina... her height and age were a close match to Anna Prokopchuk.
And Konina married John Granholm.
So, Konina is Prokopchuk, or someone who was the same height and age as she was at the end of the War.
Yes.
I'll get these to the Centre.
"The hallowed halls of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are abuzz with activity as agents struggle to keep our country safe from threats both foreign and domestic."
Laying it on a a little thick if you ask me.
You have, like, the best job in the world.
Sometimes.
Well, what's not great about it?
Well, uh...
The FBI is basically...
You know, I can't explain it to you, Henry.
Because I don't trust you.
You don't trust me?
You are the greatest kid in the world, but I have to think of you like you could be a spy.
That's what the FBI is like.
So... are you allowed to trust anybody?
Some people trust their wives.
I didn't trust mine.
I have no idea why.
Well, what about your kids?
Not really.
That sucks.
Yup.
Natalie Granholm.
And they're sure it's her?
It just says to go ahead.
They saw the same pictures we saw.
I think it looks like her.
Don't you?
Maybe.
But I want to be sure, before...
I can't just get this order from them and do whatever they say.
I'm not just...
We talked about this.
We'll make sure.
Okay.
She is reporter.
Any reason they're moving her?
I don't know.
What was Yuri's relationship like with her?
Did he seem to take any kind of special interest in her in the last few months?
Not really.
She's the same with him like with everyone.
That's all good.
Just keep noticing stuff, just like that.
Okay.
So, how's the little man?
So good.
No trouble with him.
So sweet.
Have you seen him again?
Yes.
You know, he was a very big hockey player, but he doesn't think he's too... important.
And he likes me too.
Well, good.
But you know, you have to be careful with him too.
I know.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Not one sound.
I don't have much money.
You can have what there is.
Take it.
All of it.
This isn't about money.
What do you want?
The truth.
About what?
Anna Mikhaylovna Prokopchuk.
I don't know.
I don't know what to say.
I don't know who this person is.
She's you.
What?
My name is Natalie Granholm.
I-I don't know this person
I never met this person, I never heard this name before.
I can show you.
Mnh-mnh.
It's in my pocketbook, okay?
You You see I'm not this Anna,
I'm not this person, whoever she is.
Where were you born?
Russia.
You think I knew this person from Russia?
I haven't lived there for forty years.
Where in Russia?
Where "what?"
Where are you from?
Sevsk.
You're lying.
About what?
Everything.
I don't understand...
Your life is a lie.
Why are you saying such things?
I don't know what you're talking about, who you're talking about...
Who are you?
You were born in Dyatkovo.
No, no.

You know what you are?
You're a monster.
You want to know who we are?
You alright?
Yeah.
You believe her?
She's lying.
Even if it is her...
What?

We know who you are, and we know what you've done.
What are you going to do?
Wait.

Your husband.
He should be home soon.

Can I have some water?
Natalie, what's happening?
Dyatkovo.
I'm from Dyatkovo.
You're from Sevsk.
When the Nazi overran Dyatkovo we were rounded up and taken to the square in the center of town.
I held on to my mother.
But she was shot.
They made me dig a hole...
I used a shovel, a pail, then my hands... we threw them in like garbage.
I was sixteen.
I didn't know anything about world.
About anything.
They let me live.
Why?
There was no reason.
Nothing made any sense.
They gave me food.
The first time, they gave me so much to drink,
I could barely stand up.
The first time?
That I shot them.
Soviet prisoners.
It wasn't me, in my body.
It wasn't me.
Natalie...
I couldn't say, how could I say, what could I say?
I wanted to be the person...
The person you thought I was.
I know who you are, Natalie.
I know you.
You're... good.
I'm sorry.
Please.
Whatever happened way back then
You You heard what they did to her.
You can't
