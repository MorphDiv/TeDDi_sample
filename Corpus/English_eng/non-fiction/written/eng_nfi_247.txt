Previously on "Somewhere Between"...
What did you have to tell me?
They didn't keep looking...
I'm done running around being certifiably insane.
DeBray was killed five days before
Serena disappeared the first time.
DeBray isn't the one who's going to kill my baby.
It's not over.
Did somebody come in here?
A messenger was here.
He brought something for Daddy.
- What?

So, what was the delivery?
From the office, some files.

You didn't get an envelope for me?
Got the croissants.
Here you go.

- This one is yours.

Hey, are you, going in to work?
Every decade or so, I take a Sunday off.
I gotta go in.
Depositions screaming for attention.
You think we can get Barry tonight?
Why?
Maybe somebody used their pull as a power player to get a table at Epic at 7:30.
Wow.

Well, God gave us incisors for a reason.
Are we good?
- Yeah.

Call you later.
Goodbye, sweetpea.
Mwah.
Nobody could ever make me go to work on a Sunday.
And no one ever will.

I'm running a new program on it.
Something from Switzerland.
Chocolate and cuckoo clocks, that'll dig an image out of the blur.
Are we, like, done with this whole paying client thing?
Because I've been getting calls.
Nothing yet on the wrist, but we're working on it.
What would you say if I told you that somebody who might be the man who shot Haskell DeBray just brought my husband a photograph that he lied about and then shredded?
I'd say watch the runon sentences.
Maybe he was getting close to something, with the cops, and... and this is their way of fighting back.
Or mmaybe he got too close before, and that's why they took Serena.
I need your help, Nico.
Takes a big person to admit that.
Angel, grab your jacket.
Baby?
I'm so sorry, baby.
I'm so sorry.
There's a midnight vigil at his house.
I want to ggo with Ruby.
Hey.
I can take you to the vigil tonight.
Maybe Ruby can come.
How did...
How did you know about the vigil?
I heard about it on the radio downstairs.
I'm so sorry.
I'm right here for you.
I love you.
You know, when I was a kid, my own Jesse Reid died.
His name was Freddie Mercury.
And it felt like a piece was ripped out of the world and nothing could put it back.
Is that kind of how you're feeling right now?
Mostly I feel bad for his wife.
Vivica.
She's gonna be sad for a long time.
You know who's not sad?
Jesse.
'Cause he's in rock and roll heaven right now, and he's jamming out like crazy with... with... with... with Freddie, and... and Jimi, and Janis, and they've got angels for backup.
Did Freddie Mercury have a beautiful voice?
Freddie's voice was...
You know what?

This is a huge day for you.
The day you hear "Bohemian Rhapsody" for the first time.
Is she ready, Mom?
Are you?
Ready?
Thank you.
Yeah.
Let me see the letter.
God forbid it should be an "X," or a "Q,"
or something that isn't in every word in the English language.
Who's Galileo?
Guy that invented the telescope.
You know, if this has something to do with the cop you told him to catch, why doesn't he just tell you?
If there was a way that you could...
Revert to my day job?
Sleuth around and dig up deep, dark secrets?
If you did, how would you do it?
Move fast, for starters.
What does scareamoosh mean?
You know what, honey?

Whatever hit him, he's gonna deal with it, so we gotta be on his heels.
But I gotta give you the boilerplate:
People almost never like what they find.
When their life is blown up into a million pieces...
Her daddy is the moon and the stars to her.
If I blow up my life, I blow up hers.
Maybe it was just a random motorcycle messenger.
Yeah.
Maybe Serena wasn't paying attention,
- and she just...

Thought it was an envelope.
And Tom, he...

Maybe it doesn't have anything to do with anything.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Somewhere in a hospital bed out there in the city,
Mimi's alive.
What?
I'm sorry.
Mimi died early this morning.
What?

Cardiac arrest.
You did everything you could.
My God.
I want you to do it.
I want to know.
There's more when I get back, yes?
Thank you, Janet.
Good work.
Here we go.

All right, here he comes.

What are you up to?
Looks like we're not the first sleazemeisters to come skulking around here.
District Attorney has a key to a door he doesn't live behind.
We could tell he's placing illegal bets on dog races or... or... or smoking opium in a den in Chinatown.
I think what she's looking for is the, um, truth?
She can't handle the truth.
I've seen you reduce dozens of spouses into heaps of weeping misery between hits on a macchiato.
What's the big difference with this one?
Cut it out, or I'll start charging by the.
All these years you act like if you opened a crack in that frozen spacerock in your chest, you'd be cheating on Susanna.
- Or making her more dead than she is.

Then someone finally hacks through the ice,
- and it's the District Attorney's wife?

I know that if I had a friend who saw what you saw and didn't tell me, I would crack their skull.
Just work.
You found something already?
I told you he'd move fast.
Where's Serena?
She's upstairs making a papermache relief map of ancient Rome.
Show me.
The blackmailer took a photo from the same spot.
Looks like he was going to put a stop to whatever he was being blackmailed for.
One thing led to another.
You know her?
Mara, my assistant for six years.
Serena calls her Auntie Mara.
Hey.
Why don't you sit down for a second?
Thank you.
I said thank you.
Yeah, okay.
We're not finished.
A week before Serena died,
Mara had a bruise right where Tom's grabbing her.
So the same thing happened the first time.
She told me she fell, but now we know the truth.
He grabbed her arm because she swung at him.
She swung at him because he was going to break up with her.
- Okay.

Maybe the blackmailers didn't get what they wanted, so they took Serena.
If it's the same blackmailers, then Tom knows who they are.
Which means Tom knows who's coming after Serena.
You should work for me.
Hours are long, but the pay is low.
Just sayin'.
Right.

No.

Well, give me three more positions in Victims Services.
- Hang up the phone.

- Take it from the Appellate budget, or...

Gotta go.

What's up?
You tell me.
I went there to tell her it was over.
I don't think she got the message.
I'm weak.

But you know I love you.
Who's blackmailing you with this?
- What?

- Tom?

Who sent the pictures of you and Mara to the house?
How do you even know about that?
You don't get to ask me anything.
Who's blackmailing you?
They haven't made any demands yet.
There's a lot of people in this city that want things from me, Laura.
I don't know who it is.
You'd better find out, because their next move is to kill Serena.
What?
Tom, find out who they are.

Until you know, I don't want to see you.
What do you mean they're gonna kill Serena?
- Ask them.

Why would I believe anything you say?
Laura...
You haven't showered.
She's still on you.
I want to bring something really special to the vigil tonight.
To make Vivica feel better.
Well, it's the love of the fans that'll help her get through.
There's this drawing I made of Jesse when I was six.
Of him giving her a rose at the benefit concert for the refugees, when he proposed.
That would be perfect.
But it's in my time capsule, which I promised my dad I wouldn't open until 2030.
Do you think it's okay to break a promise if it helps somebody?
Do you mean does the end justify the means?
That is the textbook definition of a moral dilemma.
Do what your heart says, and it will never lead you wrong.
Think I'll ever be able to hear it again sometime?
And now that title means something completely different forever.
I figured it out, Grandma.
What did you figure out, sweetheart?
Why I'm not sad about Jesse being dead.
It's because I used up all my sad on my dad.
We all have, sweetheart.
We have to pray.
For God to put my dad at the bottom of the list?
No, sweetheart.
That would be praying for somebody else's dad to be at the top.
Then what do we pray for?
A miracle.
For all of us.
- Hi.

Sh...
What are you doing?
Why...

I was just... just getting some cardio while I can.
Where's Serena?
At the house where I left her.
You left her alone?
You're joking, right?

Mara?
I just keep thinking about this little munchkin that I'm never gonna see.
One of these days, he is gonna pay.
She said she missed Serena and you told her if she wanted, she could come over and give me a break.
That's okay, isn't it?
Laura?

Emergency Services.
My name is Laura Price.
My husband's the District Attorney.
I need your help.
Serena?

Hey, Mom.

I wanted to see you, sweetpea.
Hello, Laura.
What a surprise to see you here.
I wanted some playtime with my little munchkin.
She's getting so big, I never see her anymore.
I'm taking Serena shopping.
Maybe you can play with her another time.
Shopping?
For what?
Well, it's a surprise.
I was hoping to hang out with the whole family.
Why don't you call Tom, have him come home and join us?
Sweetheart, I have to talk to Auntie Mara about some boring adult stuff.
Would you go upstairs and download all the information about the vigil?
We got to get the time, parking, address.
- Print it all out, okay?

And, um, play Jesse's new single.
Loud enough so we can hear it down here.
You want to hear Jesse's new single?
Loud enough to make the floors shake.
I will never figure you out.
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.
I'm not going to shoot her.
Call your loving husband.
Invite him to the party.
Mara, he hurt the both of us.
We can bring him down together.
He'll have to resign as D.A.
Tom's greatest fear is being nobody.
Second only to his fear that something will take the shine off his perfect, shining little girl.
It's too bad his concern didn't extend to his second child.
Such a tragedy.
The D.A. watches in horror as his girlfriend blows the top of her head off in front of his flawless angel.
He's not worth that.
One munchkin, destroyed.
It's an even trade for mine.
Call him, or I'll do it now, and I'll take you with me.
Watch the D.A. come home to that.
I've called the police.
They're probably downstairs.
You're my friend.
And I...
I still love you.
Give me the gun and I'll tell them we settled it.
- Come on.

And then they'll let me go home.
Call him, or I'll end this now.
Okay.
When did it start?
Last year, when you were in the hospital with the shoulder thing.
Did you have sex with him in my bed?
Call him.
Did you have sex with him in my bed?

I'm not gonna ask you again, Laura.
No!
Don't move!
I'm Laura Price.

That's her gun.

Laura...
My daughter's upstairs, so can we please take this outside?
Hey!
This was found in her pocket.
I got all the info, the police are letting people park on the streets...
Mom?
Auntie Mara?
Hi.

Mom, where are you?

This is District Attorney Tom Price.
Please leave a mess...
You can pin it on this one.
It's the jacket I wear the most.
Okay, then.
Why do you need to put a tracker on me?
Your mom's told you it's a dangerous world, right?
About a million times.
Well, this is us being extra careful.
If you take the jacket off, you put it on your shirt.
That way, you never get lost.
All right?
I don't think there's such a thing as lost.
How do you figure that?
Well, wherever you go, all you have to do is look around, and that's where you are.
That's the most real thing I've ever heard anybody say.
- In your whole life?

You must not have heard very many things.
I've heard some stuff.
I am.
You are what?
Proud to be odd.
Me too.
Daddy, are you proud to be odd?
Hey, baby.
Where's your mom?
I don't know.

You didn't answer your phone, and neither did she, so I called Captain Nico.
Your Mom never said where she was going?
Nope.

Why don't you go on up?
I know, I know.

- I'm way ahead of you.

Laura would never walk out that door and leave Serena alone.
But she's gone.

Let me see if I like me for abducting your wife.
Opportunity?
Here I am.
Means?
Strong arms, wicked cold stare.
Motive?
Motive.

Maybe the victim's husband swore on his life that I could testify against my brother secure in the knowledge the prosecution wouldn't seek the death penalty.

As the details of the murders emerged, Nico,
- the picture changed.

And a sworn promise to a grieving family, what's that worth, Tom?
- Stay away from my wife...

- Stay away from my daughter...

And away from me, or I will make your life
- a living hell.

Someone beat you to that one.
Lay down, sweetpea.
Why isn't Mom here?
Because of me.
I did something really stupid and it made Mommy mad.
You know what?

No matter what happens between Mommy and me, no matter what changes, one thing will never, ever change:
We both love you very, very much and we always will.
Are you having a moral dilemma, Daddy?
Sometimes I forget how smart you are.
At my peril.
All righty.

Mom was gonna take me to the midnight vigil for Jesse.
Honey, it's a school night.
II don't know.
Nobody's letting me go to school these days anyway, so what's the difference?
I want to go.
You know what?
Let's go.
Really?
Yeah, why not?
This will be something you'll remember for the rest of your life.
You and your old man out in the city at midnight.
Ooh!
I love you, baby.
Get off her.
Stay out of this.
Don't ask questions.
Next time I drop you.
No.
No!
Now you know I can get to you.
Please, do anything to me.

No more questions.
No more digging around in things that aren't your business.
Serena...

The door's unlocked...
No.

Then Tom came home.
She's with Tom.
You okay?
Ruby!
You made it!
The tattoo on his wrist is the same design as the drawing in Serena's pocket... when she drowned...
Positive?
In a thousand years, I'd never forget it.
Thorns on a vine, with a snake running through it.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Like that?

Jenny pulled it out of a screen cap.
You're not paranoid.
- The guy that killed Haskell DeBray...

Is the guy that's blackmailing your husband.
Is the guy who tied me to the top of a roof.
So if we figure out what all those things have to do with each other, we win, right?
What does he want us to stay out of?
My husband and Mara?

I don't know, but if we stay out of it,
- maybe he leaves Serena alone.

We just go home and forget the whole thing happened.
You good with that?
I didn't think so.
So why does he want to hurt Serena?
No.

He's in with the cops.
My husband's going against the cops.
Maybe this is them fighting back.
Maybe we're the first warning.
And Serena's the second.
- See ya.

- Where are you?

Where's Serena?
She talked me into bringing her to the vigil.
Why did you leave her alone?
- What's the address?

- It is...

I'll be there in 15 minutes.
I wish we could get inside so I could give Vivica my drawing.
Wishes can come true.
All we have to do is pretend like we're their kids.
Okay, act bored.
Kiss me, brother.
I got you the man who shot Haskell DeBray.
If this is you being Nico...
You mean the winged avatar of justice once again ready to swoop in and pluck your cojones out of the campfire?
I'll text you the address.
In a mechanical room, under a broken skylight, there's a glove drenched in the guy's DNA.
How'd it get there?
What did you do?
Heroic exploits later, glove now.
Peace.
Whoa.
He sat in these chairs.
Every single one of them.
Look.
It's his double platinum record for "Desperate Days."
I need to find Vivica fast so my dad doesn't worry.
- Where's Serena?

Where were you?
- Where?

She was right there.
She's gone.
- She's in the house.

- I tracked her.

He put a tracker on her.
Excuse me.
Hey, hey, hey.
Who's that man that just went in there?
Seriously?
My daughter's in there.

I have to go and get her.
How about I call security inside and they'll...
Hey!
- Come back!

I'm here on official business, and they're with me, okay?
Can you open my time capsule?
It was too tight for me.
Thanks.
Meet back here in 10.
- Track her.

Lousy stoneage trash is only accurate to thirty feet.
You left, me right.
All right.
Ruby, where's Serena?
She went to go give a present to Vivica.
She's sad because Jesse died and...
- and Serena just wanted to...

We were supposed to meet in five minutes in the hallway with all of the chairs.
- That way.

I snuck out.
- Please don't be angry at...

Just show me where she is, okay?
Uncle Nico!
What are you doing here?
What's wrong?
Come on.

- Vivica, are you okay?

Serena!
God, Serena.
Where were you?

Something came up, something I couldn't stop from happening, and I couldn't call you.
But I knew you'd do the right thing, and you did.
Hey.

He...

You know what?

Who's dangerous?
Somebody in the story Mommy's working on.
- Taller than me?

And he had a black helmet on.
Yeah, I think he just went out the front.
- Okay.

- Come on, sweetie.

Girls, wait here.
The bike's not there.
Gone.

Stop with the negativity.
We have his DNA on the glove.
And this.
You ready for your head to explode?
They all have the tattoo.
Where did you find it?
Needle in a haystack of pictures on top of the piano.
Laura, listen to me.
I know this girl.
Next to Jesse, that's Susanna.
Your fiancée.

This was taken the day it happened, in Spanish Harbor.
Ten years ago.
How do you know that?
Look at the flag.

And that's the yellow scarf she was wearing.
The one she was strangled with.
That's Jesse Reid.

One of them killed Haskell DeBray, blackmailed your husband, tied you up, almost killed me and showed up to his old friend's wake.
Or it was the three of them, dividing the labor.
And the three of them disappeared.
I know how they undisappear.
Look at the tattoos.
You see the redness?

That's fresh ink.

Nico, how could you possibly know who inked them?
Because he's Susanna's father.
And this picture was taken down the street from his shop.
Is the shop still there?
Did he keep records?
It was when I drove down a year ago.
And if we're lucky, he does keep records.
What?
Where the hell did you go?
I'm leaving.

Whatever you're messed up in
- is putting our daughter in danger.

So I'm the one who got her poisoned on a flight to Hawaii?
I'm the one who left her alone in the loft?
I didn't leave her alone.
I was attacked.
By the same man who's blackmailing you with pictures of Mara.
He was a courier.
- A courier?

Who likes to kidnap people and tie them to rooftops?
What are you...

Goodbye, Tom.
You're not going anywhere with him.
If you try to stop me,
I'll upload the pictures of you and Mara.
You can wake up to "D.A.'s Lunchtime Love Nest"
on every channel.
We'll see how that works in your next election.
You really are your mother.
If I was my mother, you'd be bleeding from the crotch.
I was yours... forever.
So was I.
Serena.
Come say byebye to your daddy.

Come on.
Come here, baby.
- We're going on a trip.

- Hi.

We'll drop off Ruby on our way.
I'll see you very soon, sweetheart.
I love you.
- Bye.

Let's go.
Hello?
All right, Tom, we've been talking and...
My wife knows about Mara.
So we are back to the original conversation
- about a ring and an earring.

I don't want to play it this way any more than you do.
- But the fact is that...

Listen.
Yeah, not the ideal process, but the answer is yes.
You got it.
That's...

I mean, you...

You'll bring the ring and the earring?
No, they're someplace safe.
I will have them to you, in the morning, any time, okay?
I'll, I'll call you first thing.
What?

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no!
