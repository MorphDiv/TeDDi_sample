The United States created the very notion ofthepeaceful transition of power.
Thisisaconcept that was nonexistent ontheplanetEarth before Washington transferred power to John Adams inthelatterpart of the 18th century.
Before that, the world was made up, principally, ofmonarchies, where kings and queens onlyrelinquishedpower through death ormoresinisterforces.
The idea that someone would voluntarily relinquish power and hand it off to another person was actually a really radical experiment in governance.
But here we are doing it systemically.
