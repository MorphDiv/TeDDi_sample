Dear Lord... please forgive me.
I was a fool.
I thought You'd betrayed me, and all I could hear was my own anger.
But now I know.
You have chosen me.
You have a purpose for me.
You said to Jeremiah, "Call to Me,
"and I will answer you,
"and I will tell you great and mighty things which you do not know."
Well, here I am, God... calling to You.
I am Your servant.
Reveal my path to me, and I shall do everything You demand.
Your will be done.
Water's perfect.

I haven't been in the pool in five years.
That's a fucking shame.
People lucky enough to have a pool should pay a fine if they don't use it once a month.
Open it to the public.

You reading the obituaries?
I'm trying to see if there's going to be a funeral for her, but I can't find it.
The Natasha girl?
Yeah.

Okay.

- Don't.

I get that you're spooked.

But you don't know that that cop shot her.
I heard his voice.
Then you call the FBI.
You call the fucking DEA.
Anybody with badges and guns.
And say what?
So you do nothing?

I love you, honey, and boy, do I love hanging out by your fucking pool.
But I can't be your babysitter for the rest of your life.
I told you when I got here that I could only stay till today.
Wait, wait.

Why?
If you're not going to do anything, how will tomorrow be any different than today?
If you don't trust the cops, you should at least call Pernell.
I got a letter from our landlord today.
60 day notice.

They can kiss my ass.
This is our home.

You know, that's why they don't want us here.
They don't want us to tell the truth.
But because you do...

- Paul...

Alicia, I...

I have one chance to do it fresh.
Okay.

You need to see this.
I already called the cops.
Thanks.
Just ask him to leave.
If he refuses, don't push it.
Just wait for the cops.
Actually, Holly, I'll talk to him.
There he is, the skeptic.
You still mad at God?
Here I am.
Take it out on me.
I don't want to fight.
Why are you in our chapel?
We worship God here.
We've been found.
So have I.
I believe.
We don't want you here.
Why not?

You don't believe.
Yes, I do.

No.

This is why I'm here.
God is sending me messages through this pen.
I would like for you to help me understand it.
All right, you might think you're anointed.
You're not going to get my help again.
I am telling you that everything you told me was right.
- I see that now.

Bad people who I never would have found without God's guidance and your help.
A few days ago, you wanted to kill me because you didn't think there was a God.
And now you're back to thinking you're anointed?
When did that change?
When I realized that God kept His promise.
You remember Tessie?
Yeah, your call girl.
My wife.

It's a boy.
My boy.
Your hooker wife is pregnant, and you think that makes you anointed?
God didn't give PJ back to me, but he did give me a son.
He answered me.
Just... not in the way that I expected.
I'm glad you believe again.
I truly hope you can walk your path with Jesus by your side, but this is not the church for you.
Who's the nonbeliever now?
You okay, Judge Harris?
Yeah.

You know what it's like...
I saw this video one time where this deaf kid got an operation so he could hear for the first time.
These cochlear implants they got.
Anyway, after the operation, they set him down at this table, and, and they tapped one, but they haven't turned the thing on yet, so he doesn't hear anything.
And then they turn on the device, and they tap... and the kid... he starts bawling.
That's all it took...

That's how I feel, Keith.
Like I've been going through life with no sound, and now everything I hear is a miracle.
That's how it is for me, too, Judge Harris.
When I first met you in that courtroom, it was like somebody tapped on the table.
You've been right all along.
I'm so sorry I made you wait.
But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait with patience.
Well... the waiting's over.
We're going to put an end to this fucking trial.
Shane Caldwell's wife said that there's a video that I would pay good money for.
Does she have it?
I don't think so, but she definitely knows what's on it.
I want to start there.

Yes, sir.
She's not going to come by choice.
Not the same old steakhouse here, right?
Every once in a while, you got to change up the rhythm.
Half the kitchen staff here is from El Salvador.
This is what they cook for themselves.
I thought so.
There's pepperoni in this papusa.
Yeah, these guys pick up some new flavors from el norte.
You want to get some slaw on that.
It's good stuff.
You ever been to El Salvador?

You should take your lady there some time.
Or your man or whatever.
Just go for yourself.

Went down there for my third honeymoon.
If I'm smart, it's my last.
You ever been married?
No.
Yeah.
Mach dot This, eHookUp, whatever.
Everyone keeps asking like it's so hard to get into a relationship.
It ain't half as hard as getting out of one.
You know what I mean?
I was wondering when we'd get around to having this conversation.
- Two more beers.

Go ahead.
Okay.
San Vicente politics have run on Harris family money for forever.
It's a bad relationship, which gives you a real opportunity here...
A chance to turn being the biggest employer in San Vicente to being a political force.
But there are going to be some people you need to have on your side.
People you could persuade?
A lot of them are more loyal to the Harris family money than they are to Pernell.
You know anything about Africanized honeybees?
Word is they have extra-big stingers.
That's probably a myth.
What they have is a uniquely political behavior, even for social insects.
When they find another hive, they send a few workers over.
They cling to the hive, make themselves known to the local bees, communicate, share food.
So when an African queen shows up to take over, they welcome her as one of their own.
Here we are.
I paid for two clinics, a park, a quarter of the REAL Initiative so far.
Yes, you have.
Senior elections are coming up, and there's going to be campaigns to fund.
You get the right friends in line, it's going to take bigger moves and deeper pockets.
What if I fully funded the REAL Initiative myself?
No Harris money.
No fundraisers, that sort of move?
Well, yeah.
That would make an impression.
You understand that once the process of taking over a hive begins, it can become chaotic.
There can be no order until the new power structure's in place.
Like humans, like bees, right?
Not really.
Humans sometimes tolerate multiple loyalties, but a hive can only have one queen.
Then I say viva la fucking bees.
Here we are, sir.
Wine list and menu.
Both Boss Hogs.

- It's proper.

Kaplan couldn't fucking believe it, but the judge sustained it.
He says if the dog is in the will, it has standing to contest.
His face goes all red!
Hey, let's get out of here, okay?
Ahem.
Caldwell's wife is gone.
Gone shopping or gone gone?
Clothes missing, the flowers are dead, and the milk's gone sour.
Seems like she left in a hurry.
Maybe somebody made her leave.
Didn't want her talking to me.
I took some mail and stuff.
Should help us track her down.
If she's traveling with a kid, it's going to make it easier.
She's got a sister in Ukiah.
Well, that day may come, but it's not today.
God gave me the meaning of another one of my visions.
What was it?
You know Proverbs 25:19?
Yeah.

That's the one.
I can call another vote for the Harris High name change, but it won't matter.
It's still going to be 4-3 in Pernell Harris' favor.
Why poke the bear?
Do you hear yourself?
You're basically saying that you're more afraid of Pernell Harris than of Robert Boston, and that's okay.
I don't want you to be scared of me.
I want you to believe in me.
I'm at the top of my game, and next year I'll be re-elected in a cakewalk, and he will be on trial for murder.

You know I love you, Robert, but my position is not appointed.
I have to run, just like you, and the Harris family is my biggest donor, by far, every election.
You don't need them anymore, Gloria.
You got name recognition now.
- How do you think I got that?

I need you to trust me.
Put the vote back on the agenda for next week.
Thank you.
Yes, sir, Mr. Mayor.
Looks like Pernell RSVP'd to your party.
- You're kidding me.

He's not coming to my party.
So you invite your three ex-wives but not your bestie?
Yes.
Once he becomes my ex-friend long enough, then he'll get invited again.

Okay.

No.

Me?
Yes.

- Um...

I'll have Cam drive me.
Crys?
Honey...
I got to go.
I want to get home before dark.
- This doesn't make sense.

The ME's report.

What's wrong with it?
It says that she was shot during a drug deal.
They found a pipe in a bag and empty meth phials everywhere.
Well, maybe she was a part-time user.
She wasn't a tweaker.

She was a brilliant one.
PJ got high, didn't he?

I was on the phone with her.
She was not buying drugs.
Guy next door was.

That is not what happened!
This is just...

Jesus Christ.
What the fuck are you doing?
I'm trying to make this right.
Are you?

You didn't kill her.
She'd be alive today if I didn't talk her into going.
Crys, you can't control everything!
And I know that's what you like to do.
You've always done that, and it's gotten you really far from where you started.
But you are drinking your own Kool-Aid if you think you've ever been in charge.
Shit happens.

You have nothing to do with it.
She didn't deserve to die like that.
She was a...
She was a fucking kid.
Just like PJ?
Is that what this is?
Bright kids are going to go where they go.
They're going to do what they do.
They're going to love who they love, and... we don't get to choose.
I'll call you when I get home.
Come in.
Hey.

How you doing, Pernell?
Great.
My dad is not coming.
Have a seat.
Nah.

He doesn't want you at his party.
If you show up, they'll stop you at the door.
They'll s...
I haven't missed one of your father's birthday parties in 20-something years.
Might be time to start a new tradition, right?
I know I fucked up, but, I mean, how am I going to make it right if I can't talk to him?
Every time you do talk to him, you make something else wrong.
Listen, Pernell, it's just not a good time.
He wants to regain some control over his life, make his own decisions.
If they can't track us, they can't control us, you know?
What do you mean by that?
PJ said that in a video.
You heard it before, right?
Maybe.

What's that have to do with your old man's birthday party?
Nothing.

Look, just steer clear tomorrow night, all right?
There's been enough static.
There's things he needs to know, Asa.
So tell me.
I'll tell him.
Nah.

- Hey.

Did you post it?
Not yet.

Why not?
I mean, that guy who beat your ass a week ago was here begging for forgiveness.
I'd think our followers would eat that up.
What if he's right?
About what?
Being chosen.
He's crazy.
Don't let him suck you in.
Whatever money he might give us, it's not worth the trouble.
I'm not thinking about the money.
Paul, he's a murderer.
Why are we even having this conversation?
Why did God choose Saul, a man who killed hundreds of Christians, to become His apostle?
Why did Jesus choose Mary Magdalene, a whore, to be His travel companion?
- Stop it.

Sometimes.
But Pernell's aren't.
I don't care if he starts walking on water.
I don't want him here.

Sorry I called you so late.
What's going on, Crys?
If I let you come back, you okay with the guest room?
I fucking love the guest room.
A knife?
Why do you have that?
Crystal.
What the fuck's going on?
Wilson's dead.
What?
She went to that meeting.
He shot her.
Who shot her?
Chief Clay.
Toby?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.

Come here, come here, come here.
Come here.
Were you there?
So how do you know it was Toby?
I heard his voice.
I was on the phone with her.
I heard everything.
Now I feel like he's always right outside the door... and he's waiting for me, and I don't know what to do.
First thing you're gonna do is get some sleep.
There's nobody outside that door.
Nobody's going to hurt you, not while I'm here.
We're going to figure all this shit out in the morning.
Thank you.
You got a little more junk in your trunk these days.
Been a busy month.

Are you sure about that?
I don't give a fuck, Fortune.
They all look good.
Okay.
Make my job a little easier.
Now, maybe next time,
I'll just have a suit off the rack from Macy's.
Hey, look, I didn't mean it like that.
You know.

What do you think?
Nice.
Want to talk to me about the Valco tract?
No.
Want me to talk to you about the Valco tract?
We're done here, Fortune.
I just need my box.
Bobo, you're playing games with yourself.
You told me that the Shane Caldwell connection meant nothing.
That Valco order was going to be signed, no matter what.
It won't look that way.
Do you honestly think that I'm the only person that knows how to connect the dots?
There aren't any dots to connect.
Really?

Well, let me tell you what I found in two days.
Shane Caldwell... dot.
Eminent domain order for the Valco tract... dot.
Holding companies that own land around the Brooks development... dot, two of which I've already been able to connect to the Harris Family Trust...
Dot dot.
And the value of the land has tripled since construction started...
- Dot-dot-dot.

You're so good at what you do.
Now I understand why you didn't want to testify.
I didn't do anything illegal.
Don't aim too high now.
Are you serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
You think I'm any different than any other politician?
I used to.
Izzy, you been around long enough.
You know what it is.

The Brooks Innovation deal is changing the course of history in this city.
And it was hanging on by a thread.
So I had to make Pernell happy to get the deal done.
- That's it.

Of course not.
But it is his fault, the reason why I'm in this position.
That you're looking at me with disappointment in your eyes.
I...
I got Brooks Innovation setting up shop in my city.
I'm launching a $40 million education initiative.
I've got 500 people coming to my birthday party thinking I'm the toast of the town.
But the truth of the matter is what?
I'm one trial away from my whole legacy going up in smoke.
And that's his fault.
That's his fault.
See what I mean?
Crys, you do realize that Toby doesn't know that you know he killed Wilson, right?
You don't know what he knows.
I know he knows where you live.
And I know he has dozens of plausible reasons for his guys to storm in here and start shooting and you end up accidentally dead.
But that hasn't happened, and he's had days.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
So what is it?
I called her this morning.
Wilson's...

Aw, shit.
I told her what happened to Natasha wasn't her fault.
No, it wasn't.
And I told her that... the bag was mine and I made her score drugs for me.
Jesus.
Why would you do that, Crys?
Because maybe I can't control everything.
But Toby Clay put a bullet in her little girl's throat, and that woman deserves somebody to hate.
Maybe hate's not the right answer.
Sometimes it's all a mother has left.
Dear Lord, please lead him to speak with truth and enlightenment so that we may find the next step in our path.
- Amen.

So this neurologist that I was seeing... he said that the brain, under stress... can have these episodes.
It may seem like hallucinations, but, um, it's really the brain in overdrive making these connections that you would never see otherwise.
You think that's possible?
I mean, it's plausible, right?
So this thing that's been bugging me,
I kept having these visions of your teeth falling out, and I couldn't figure it out.
And then I saw you yesterday, and it hit me.
You know your Bible, Adam?
Proverbs 25:19?
Relying on a treacherous man in time of trouble is like chewing with a broken tooth.
A treacherous man.
That's you, Adam.
Lose the gag.
You can talk now if you want.

You're out of your mind if you think you can get away with this.
Chances are I'm getting a lethal injection, so you don't think I give a fuck what I can get away with, do you?
You, on the other hand, should be very concerned because you're on trial, too, and I'm the judge, so bang-bang-bang, court's in session.
First and only witness, Mr. Adam Regis.
Help!
Nope.

Careful, Adam.
My bailiff is very enthusiastic.
How did they get you to sell me out?
Did they pay you?
Or was it as easy as just asking?
I...

Aah!

Perjury is a very serious offense in this courtroom, Mr. Regis.
Please.

Adam, Adam.
When I went to see that doctor in San Francisco, they got a photo of me on the Bay Bridge.
They knew exactly where I was going to be, when I was going to be there, and only one other motherfucker on this planet knew that information, so please cut the shit.
Or maybe we could put your mother on the stand.
I mean, Keith can find her anywhere any time.
No, I didn't...
So who did you report to?
Was it McCauley?

Or both?
Toby!

Good.
Now, you see how easy that was?
By the way, you're still fucking guilty.
Please.
- So...

Let's talk about restitution.
W-What do you mean?
Well, there's a reason why my friend left your pretty face untouched.
Something you're going to do for me, Adam.
Or we could go the other way.
What other way?
No.

Death... or restitution.
Here we go.

Thanks for your vote.

I appreciate it.
Come on, everybody.

The drinks are free.
Ooh.

Yeah.

Smile.
Shit.
Look, honey.

You're safe.

You'll be fine.
Hey!
Good evening, Mrs. Harris, judge.
Can you hold on a moment?
Hey, Asa.

Pernell, what are you doing here?
This is not part of our agreement.
I'm not taking my wife through the kitchen, Ace.
Fine.

I'll go get myself a drink.
Or three.
Come on, Pernell.
You having a good time?
Go get whatever you want.
If she'd have known
I'd be balling like this one day, she'd have had a little more patience with me.
How long since you're divorced?
11 years now.
And you're still concerned with what she thinks?
Well, that's not why I invited her.
This is to remind her she fucked up.

Hey, Mr. Brooks, sorry.
I need him a minute.
Okay.
What's up?
He came.
- Who?

Come on, Ace.
Pops, you would really rather spend your birthday with Nathan Brooks?
That's supposed to be my choice.
Look, you know how sentimental he can be.
Just give him a few minutes.

Well, shit.
I knew it.
Where is he?
I put him in the pool room.
It's the billiard room, not the pool room.
So do you play billiards in there, or do you shoot pool?
You know what?
I need another drink for this one.
Go tell him I'll be there in ten minutes.
All right.
Mrs. Harris.
Jesus.

Yeah.

No, no, you're not.

Can I get a first aid kit here, please?
I should just go to the bathroom.
There's a shard in there.
You don't need any stitches, but you're bleeding a lot.
It's because your heart is racing.
Try taking some deep breaths.
Not so good with blood?
I think I should go to the ER.
Shh.

There.
You got blood on your hand.
Here we are, Mrs. Harris.
I'll take care of this in no time.
I don't suppose you want to shoot a rack.
If anything gets shot in here, it's going to be you.
You were asked not to come.
Got you a present.
What is it, a horse's head?
I mean, it's your birthday, motherfucker.
Can you please just lighten up?
My son said you wanted to talk.
We've been talking.

Remember that time...
Ida stepped out on Papa Gene?
Look, if you came here to talk shit about my mother,
I will put my foot up your ass.
What was the name of that motherfucker she went out with?

He's got a beard under here, some shit.
Marion Townsend.
Marion Townsend.
Yeah.

It was the Mercedes that caught her eye.
A janitor's wife don't get that kind of ride at home.
Right.

Yeah, I remember after Papa Gene popped him across the face, he ripped that hood ornament off his car.
He brought it home.
He put it back on his Caprice.
What did he call it?

The Merchevy.
The Merchevy, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He kept swapping that thing from car to car until my mother passed.
She never stepped out on him again, though.
I mean, you know, things went south for a little while, but they made it right.
You know.
She stuck with him... till she died.
I'm tired of you and me playing games, Pernell.
Let me ask you a question.
You really think it was some symbolic gesture that kept my folks together?
I do think symbols matter.
Get you started, maybe.
Get you a night, maybe a week.
But things add up over time, and it takes more than symbols to get past it all.
What got my folks through another couple of decades was honesty.
Really?
Honesty about what?
Everything, my man.
Whatever you want to know... just ask.
What happened to Shane?
What's the matter, you don't gamble?
My stomach's bothering me.
Too much rich food.
Too much Pernell.
What's the hottest girl at the party doing hanging out all by herself?
Nursing my wound.
Holy shit.

Broke a glass.
Guess who insisted on administering first aid.
Pernell tried to apologize to me.
That's great.
See if you can spin that into something more.
Toby, there's a video.
Of what?
I don't know, but he thinks it's going to get him off.
I'm going to deal with Toby.
No.

Did it ever occur to you that I just might have a plan?
Why don't I get the driver to take you home?
No.

He can't hurt me here.

All right.

Gorgeous.
Hey.
You okay?
Come on.

Fireworks.
I've never been to a party with fireworks.
There he is.
Thank you, thank you.
You've got great singing voices.
Thank you so much.

You know what?
All year long, you all have to listen to me make speeches and go off about whatever the hell is so important on that day.
So tonight
I'm going to give you all a present:
No speeches.
You like that.
You like that one, yeah.
No, seriously, thank you all for coming, and, um... here's hoping we can do this again 48 years from now.
Thank you.
Can we get the fire department here?
Because this is...

You know what?

We'll take care of it.
Be careful what you wish for.
Let's bring it in.
Cut the cake!
Enjoy the party.

You know, he doesn't have to come back out.
Nah.

I want to know who he came running to about it.
We have a fucking problem.
Do you know that somewhere in this building there is a shipment of Justin Bieber wigs?
I'm not mocking your being bald.
You're always so fucking amused.
We all make choices.
Like when I chose to believe you that Crystal Harris didn't know
I killed that hacker chick?
Well, guess what.

She didn't know a few days ago.
Well, she sure as shit knows now!
She about jumped out of her skin when she saw me tonight.
And her fucking husband's got some video Caldwell made that's going to blow up his case?
I sincerely doubt that.
You can afford doubt.
I need certainty.
I need you to make sure that she never talks.
Crystal Harris is going to find Bathwater for me.
I could give a flying fuck about Bathwater!
You don't need to give a flying fuck.
Give a flying fuck about passionately is what I want, and what I want is Crystal Harris alive and free until she finishes the job.
I don't want to...

What could she prove?
What can she prove?
Nothing.
And I wouldn't worry about the video.
Pernell Harris doesn't have it.
I do.
You...

Give it to me.
No.
- Give it to me.

It's clearly best for both of us if I have some influence over your actions.
Motherfucker!
Motherfucker.
Shit.
Fuck this.
Keith!
You all right?
Yeah.

I'm all right, I think.

Who did this?
Quick little fucker.

He told Toby he has the tape.
Heh.
Now that's good.
Please, God.
"You were right."
"The gun is going to protect you."
Evening, Judge Harris.
Manny, um... give me some of your,
Balvenie 40 year, would you?
You know that's $500 a shot.
Yeah.

Celebrating?
No, I'm just trying to make the most of my last few days of freedom.
You'll beat it, sir.
Your lips to God's ears, Manny.
You a lefty?
The only people I see using Mont Blanc ballpoints are lefties.
They can't use fountain pens.
Right, because there's too much smear.
Yeah, my son got me this as a gift.
Yeah, he understood because...
You all right?
Pernell?
You okay?
Page 2.
Line 18, section C.
Shit.

I don't want to look at this.
Read it, Crys.
"Based on fingerprints,
"victim-held gun in left hand when firing fatal shot."
They fucked up, Crys.
They saw PJ write his suicide note with his left hand, so they assumed he was left-handed, so that's where they put the gun.
Except PJ did everything else right-handed.
So why would he have a gun in his left hand?
He wouldn't.
Exactly.
Our son didn't shoot himself, Crys.
He was murdered.
