[Episode 6]
Who's there?
It's me!
It's me.
It's me, Chief Seo.
Chief Seo, it's me, Eun Ho Won.
What are you doing here?
Are you going to hit me with that?
No.
Eun Ho Won, why are you here?
I was working part time.
Part time?
Then the potted plants and the stew... were you my maid?
Can you put some clothes on?
Why were you working part time in my house of all places?
Do you pity me?
I'm in a situation where I have to earn money day by day to get by.
Do you think I came here knowing this was your house?
After I saw that, I panicked and tried to leave, but you came home...
Is it that hard to find a part-time job?
Do you think I came here because I wanted to?
How nice would it be if I had a job so I wouldn't have to come here?
You're making it sound like this is all my fault.
You are the one who fired me.
Because you couldn't stand that I didn't have the qualifications.
If you entered this company unfairly, another chance would be unfair.
I'm saying this because I'm already fired.
Fair play and transparent procedure?
Is the world that fair?
To me, the world... is like that mop.
In my world, I have to clean my chief's apartment because he fired me.
But that was just a coincidence...
There's nothing after hard work...
Never once in my entire life have I thought that this world was fair.
Am I the only one who thinks it's unfair?
Do you...
Did you ask this man to get you the job?
He's a doctor?
Gosh, I'm always so unlucky.
I can't believe that was Chief Seo's house.
What part-time job haven't you done?
If she feels so wronged, why did she take the fall for her superior's mistake?
Are you that happy?
Good morning, everyone.
Wait, what's going on, Eun Ho Won?
No, Chief Seo, the thing is...
I forgot I signed it--
As a deputy, can you be this irresponsible?
How can anyone trust you?
I'm sorry, Chief Seo.
I'm sorry, I was just...
I didn't ask Eun Ho Won why she kept silent but I won't ask any more questions for your sake.
I'll be watching you.
I won't forgive you next time.
Yes, I'll remember that.
[Contractor Eun Ho Won]
You didn't mention this when we were talking yesterday.
Last night, something surprising happened--
Chief Seo called me... and told me that he misunderstood, and said to come back.
Wow.
Eun Ho Won, you're a contractor legend.
You're almost an icon of revival.
Anyway, I'm glad.
You're always welcome in my book.
Thank you, Section Chief Heo.
Yes.
Hey, about the mistake I made on the order confirmation...
I'm sorry.
I accidentally saw your picture... in Ki Taek's wallet.
Then... did you do that, knowing that Ki Taek was going to take the blame for me?
Please don't tell Ki Taek.
I'm just thankful to him for many things.
What are you talking about?
Hey, stop right there!
Isn't that obvious?
I don't think I can be there this time.
That's why I'd like our contractors to go in my place.
You said one of your grandmothers moved to America.
You didn't come to the year-end event so you could go the airport.
You even have a grandfather who gets sick at the perfect time.
You're saying weird things again.
I'm Hauline's VE!
Wait, what does that mean?
Did he say "plastic bag?"
Do Ki Taek.
Geez, that sounds like bullshit.
If you're going to skip it, tell Chief Seo yourself.
Everyone, please clear your weekend schedules.
Geez, Deputy Ha has a good memory.
You know, for events... it's more fun when there are many people bustling about.
Please do a good job for me.
Eun Ho Won, if you had come back a little later, you could have been excluded.
You must be sad.
Yes.
Cheer up.
He thinks he's my superior because he's a permanent employee.
Cheer up, my ass.
Hello!
Doctor Seo!
If she came back, she should say hello!
I thought you were in a rush, so I came during my break.
I met Chief Park as a patient.
When I opened my hospital, he helped me a lot with your products.
Chief Seo asked me for a favor regarding a community park event.
Oh, I see.
Who is he?
He's handsome.
Yes.
Look at him.
What is he doing?
Our Ho Won?
As you can see, for our community park event... we are going to donate our products to their public establishment and we want to work with you to provide medical and life support services.
I'll ask some colleagues of mine and form a team.
They asked the contractors to be there, and I was feeling wronged.
But now that you're coming, I'm happy.
By the way, I heard from Chief Park... that something bad happened.
I was wondering how I could be of help.
But I'm back.
I'm touched by your words.
I really mean it.
Oh, this is Chief Park.
You should have given me a heads-up.
Geez, I was so nervous that I almost died.
That made you nervous?
No, I'm just saying...
Chief Seo found me.
Do you think he only came to ask me about the volunteer event?
What do you mean?
I think we should avoid meeting for the time being.
Yes--
I went to see him out of curiosity.
I've heard a lot about you, so it feels like we know each other.
Do you know me?
I can see your health records from Hauline.
I heard about you.
I'm very close with Eun Ho Won on your marketing team.
How do you know her?
Eun Ho Won said she met you when your furniture was delivered here.
But the truth is, that's not when we met for the first time.
Well, Ho Won doesn't know, but we met before that.
I worked at a university emergency room until not too long ago.
That was when I met Ho Won.
Are you saying you met her when she was a patient there?
I can't tell you that because it's confidential.
Anyway, we have a deeper relationship than you can imagine.
Although Ho Won doesn't remember me.
It's a secret.
Are you here because you're sick?
Or...
Are you here for something else?
Is that why you randomly threw in the volunteer event proposal?
I went there with that proposal in mind, in the event that he was a real doctor.
But, it feels like he's testing me.
He gives me a peculiar feeling.
Then I'll look into it further.
Um, I'll call you back in five minutes.
I worked at a university emergency room until not too long ago.
That was when I met Ho Won.
Why was she in an emergency room?
She retired from the office on the 16th floor.
She's taking care of our employees' health insurance, so listen to her.
You look like my younger sister.
You're exaggerating again.
I have to take the other new recruits to a store so please talk to Eun Ho Won and she can talk to me about it later.
Okay, what is the number one cause of death in Korea?
It's cancer of various types.
Do you know the most burdensome factor of having cancer?
Okay, the cost of liver cancer treatment is 66.2 million won.
For pancreatic cancer, 64 million won.
And for lung cancer, 47 million won.
That's why you have to enroll when you're young and healthy.
In your life, today is your youngest day.
That's why you should do it now.
When I first began working as an insurance planner...
I met a young man who was living dangerously.
His name was Go Bok Soo.
His name was Bok Soo?
His name was Go Bok Soo, and meeting me was divine intervention.
That was when he signed up for my insurance plan.
And after three months...
Bok Soo, who lived with his father, was very poor.
Eat lots of vegetables and fish so you don't get sick.
He was a good son, who couldn't ask his father for money.
You'd better not get sick either.
But at that time...
The insurance plan that I offered him changed his life completely.
You're so cute.
Bok Soo received treatment with the insurance, and married a wealthy girl.
Really?
I think he became a prosecutor.
Anyway, what would have happened if he hadn't signed up for this?
If you wait three months, you don't have to worry about money if you get sick.
What if I die?
Pay outs of 150,000 won every month.
This could be a huge support for your family members.
I'll get it as long as I don't go to the hospital in the next three months?
But if I knew I was going to die, I'd sign up for 10 insurance plans.
Hey!
[Insurance Contract]
Let's think about it for one more day.
Geez, this is annoying.
The boss's son is coming, so I can't even skip out.
I felt like I was going to play well today.
I was ready to play...
Wait.
Please put these one and gather out front.
If he weren't going, you wouldn't have gone either.
Why do I have to see my superiors during my weekend?
That's true.
[Hauline's Community Volunteer Team is Full of Warmth.]
I didn't know there were so many employees.
Hey, let's take the picture and get going!
I'm going in Chief Im's car, so don't look for me.
You can quietly follow me.
Let's hurry and take the picture!
Wait, Chief Park isn't here yet.
That jerk is always making his older colleagues wait.
Please hurry it up.
What were you doing when everyone was growing?
One, two...
Why aren't you sitting down?
Someone sat in my seat.
Sit in an empty spot up there.
But what about Ah Young?
Yes, see you there.
[Hauline's Community Volunteer Team is Full of Warmth.]
I had no reason to go there.
Have you worked as a maid for a long time?
I do it when I have free time, and there's work available.
But a lot of people don't like me because I'm young.
Chief Seo, um...
About your window screen...
Yeah, I was going to talk to you about that.
My colleagues from my last company gave it to me as a farewell gift.
I wanted to change it, but then I would have to buy new curtains and the ones I wanted were out of stock.
I was just going to say it was a nice picture of you.
Oh my.
Mommy!
Are you okay?
Geez, it hurts so much...
Why weren't you wearing your seatbelt?
I'm sorry.
No, I'm fine.
Geez, don't say you're hurt later on.
You should get checked out and get some x-rays while you're here.
You'll start feeling the aftereffects tomorrow.
Eun Ho Won, you should also...
Thank you.
Even if I get checked out, nothing will change.
Hello, I need to get back to Seoul.
But I was in an accident, so I was separated from my group.
I can pay you back when I get back to Seoul.
Mister, I have to go back to Seoul, but I'm out of batteries.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but can you lend me some...
Why are you using our company?
Chief Seo.
Is it your specialty to do something without anything to fall back on?
If you don't have any money, why did you run away?
And... take off that embarrassing vest.
Let's leave.
I'm okay too.
But you don't look okay.
What about Deputy Ha and Ho Won?
Ho Won seemed okay, but I don't know where she went.
And Section Chief Jo was moved to a different hospital.
I shouldn't put any weight on it, right?
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
I'm glad you're not hurt.
Have you not eaten for a few days?
No, I didn't have breakfast.
But the others didn't get hurt too badly, did they?
Worry about yourself.
I didn't run away.
I had to go to the washroom.
Is it because you're afraid the cost won't be covered as a contractor?
You must feel wronged to go through this on your weekend.
This morning, when we were racing down the highway on the bus...
I felt so free.
Spring is a harsh season for people looking for jobs.
The first hiring season of the year is from January to March.
I prepared my documents, submitted my applications, took my exams failed, and felt lost.
After that, spring is over.
This spring, we still have many days left.
Do we?
"When I get a job and get my first check..."
"I will go to see the flowers."
That's what I decided every March.
But after deciding that, I neglected spring for many years.
So did you come today to see the flowers?
Yes.
This could possibly be my last spring...
That's what I thought... and came here thinking of it as a free vacation.
It felt nice to get out of Seoul.
I've never dreamed of going on a vacation.
I regret it.
I regret it now.
One ticket to Seoul.
Thank you.
Here's your ticket to Seoul.
Aren't you going back with me?
Eun Ho Won.
Is this really where your house is?
It's so pretty.
Father!
What brings you here?
You punk.
Why do you have to tell her that?
Look at his expression right now.
If he's like that with me, imagine how he is at work.
Am I right?
We have to get going after we eat.
We had some work to do nearby, and stopped by to say hello.
I suddenly thought of my dad.
My dad used to prepare food like this when I came home from school.
Really?
That sounds like Woo Jin.
Woo Jin's mother passed away, so he grew up eating my cooking.
Eat up.
Go and look at the flowers.
How can I play when you're doing the dishes?
We're not at work.
My father always cooked, so doing the dishes was my job.
Chief Seo, your rubber shoes suit you.
I look good in anything.
No, I'm new, so I have a lot to learn.
But when I think about it, he's always right.
That's the problem.
He's right when you think about it later, but he's unlikeable in the moment.
Even if he's right, you don't want to listen.
You two are very different.
He suffered a lot growing up in a poor family.
He worked when he studied abroad because I couldn't support him.
Children suffer if their parents don't help out.
Oh, we were with our other collegues but we somehow ended up alone.
I told him I had wanted to go see flowers for a long time
Even if Woo Jin acts like a jerk, look upon him favorably.
He's not like that.
You're really pretty.
I'm jealous that you bloomed so beautifully.
What are you mumbling to yourself?
The flowers are just so pretty.
If I take them... they'll die before they finish living.
You know...
I thought... you came from... a wealthy family and hadn't experienced any hardships.
That means I should work even harder, right?
You worked hard today.
If you don't feel well tomorrow, you can call in sick and rest.
I'll give you money for a taxi.
Oh...
I can share a taxi with you and get out at your place.
My place?
Thank you for today, Chief Seo.
I got to enjoy the spring flowers thanks to you.
Chief Seo, you must be scared of cats.
No, why would I be?
You hid behind me because you were surprised.
I wasn't hiding anywhere.
I live right here, Chief Seo.
Thank you for walking me home.
Wait, Chief Seo.
Thank you... for taking me back.
[Insurance Contract]
Yeah, I'm going to work hard without giving up.
What's up with her?
She cries one moment and smiles the next.
I took a different car, so nothing happened to me.
Deputy Ha, Deputy Lee, and Jae Min are on bed rest.
I'm sorry I'm late.
It's just a little uncomfortable, but it's bearable.
Section Chief Jo is pretty amazing.
When I heard you were in an accident, I felt empty inside.
Wow, this is how fragile our lives are.
I strangely wanted to go in a different car that morning.
Are you sure it wasn't because you wanted to go golfing?
Why are you being like that?
Section Chief Jo, can you work with your injured hand?
But, I'm worried about our sales not going up.
Is there anything we can do?
When we release our new products, our situation will improve.
When I looked at the marketing reports the response to our new products is very positive.
I'll speak with Section Chief Jo separately.
Eun Ho Won, report to me about the photos we're uploading to our online site.
Yes.
Chief Seo, when did you get back to Seoul?
I came back right away and rested at home.
Do Ki Taek, did you check our product reports?
Okay...
Yes.
Wow, it's delicious.
Kang Ho.
Get me last year's sales graph from Deputy Lee's desk.
Yes, Section Chief Jo.
I saw that you didn't eat because of your arm.
Please eat this while you work.
Actually, can you help me?
Yes?
It's so pretty.
Ho Won, did you receive the outfit?
If I send you money, you'll probably save it and send it back to Mom.
That's why I got a friend's help and picked this out myself.
You no longer have to work multiple part-time jobs in bad weather.
Now that you work in an office, I'm so happy.
After Dad passed away... we never smiled comfortably.
Punk.
My sister, Eun Ho Won...
I admire you.
[Ho Jae]
Read over the terms and conditions one more time, and sign here.
You have nice handwriting.
[Ji Na]
Yes, see you tomorrow.
Ji Na!
Oh, I just felt stiff and heavy this morning.
Ji Na.
I kept this in my wallet.
I couldn't throw it away, so I wanted to return it to you.
Ki Taek.
I'm really going now.
See you tomorrow, Deputy Ha.
Ki Taek.
Three jobseekers tried to commit suicide and ended up in an ER and then they ended up working for the same company.
Let's go.
[The three people met again.]
Chief Seo.
What's the matter?
Let me ask you a question.
I won't be able to sleep tonight if I don't ask you this.
Did you really do it because of me?
Did you try to commit suicide because of me?
