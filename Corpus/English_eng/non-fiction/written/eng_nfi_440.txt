Come in!
Our new favorite insurance agency!
Oh, my, God, Battling Bud, you're the man!
Looks like you boys made quite a night of it.
Dougie, you might want to call your wife.
Wife?
Bushnell, we come bearing gifts, tokens of our gratitude to you.
What is all this?
A box of Montecristo Number Twos.
Oh, nice.
A set... of monogrammed diamond cuff links.
Oh, they're beautiful.
And the keys to your new car!
A BMW convertible.
Now you and Dougie have a matched set.
Fellas...
I am speechless.
Oh!
A wrong has been made right, and the sun is shining bright.
Ah, thank you, fellas.
I-I have no idea what happened, Mr. Todd.
Well, this is most unfortunate.
But you know what to do.
We talked about this.
I am giving you one day to remedy this situation.
But you said two before.
One day.
Do we have a complete understanding?
Yes, sir.
Roger.
Roger, get in here, please.
Hold on just a minute.
Mrs. Jones?
Yeah?
Uh, where do you want it set up?
W-what?
Sonny Jim's new gym set, courtesy of the Mitchum brothers.
And the car, too?
Mitchum brothers.
Where do you want the gym?
Backyard?
Oh, Dougie.
When you didn't come home last night,
I thought the worst.
Look what you've done.
Sonny Jim's in seventh heaven.
And then the car...
Oh, Dougie...
I love you so much.
_
Fuck.
Fuck.
What's the problem, Ray?
I killed that guy.
He's the one I told you about.
You didn't kill him too good, Ray.
I will now.
Hey, Ray, you in here somewhere?
And how did he get the code?
I gave it to him.
Came to see you, buddy.
But only to the door.
So he's trapped.
And mine.
All right.
I'll let you have him.
I want to have some fun with him first.
Bring him up!
Get in the elevator.
Put the gun away, Ray.
What do we have here?
I came to see my friend Ray.
I'm here, you fuck.
Settle down, Ray.
Looks like we got ourselves a new contestant here.
Tell him how it works, Muddy.
Real simple.
This man is our boss... 'cause no one can beat him at arm wrestling.
Imagine all the men who've tried.
Many, many.
In 14 years, no one's ever even come close.
Any new guy gets one chance.
One chance.
And if you lose,
Renzo's your boss.
So you can leave now.
If you stay and lose and you do not do what Renzo says... you die.
So you decide.
Looking at you,
I'd say you better leave.
What is this, kindergarten?
Nursery school?
What do I get if I win?
Then you'd be our boss.
I don't want to be your boss.
But if I win, I want him.
Step inside.
Let's play the game.
That was from the nursery-school teacher.
Sit down.
Rules!
Starting position.
Wrestling arm on table.
Yeah.
Doesn't know what he got into.
Other hand cannot touch table.
Hands up!
Grip!
Do not start until I say.
You ready, boss?
Ready.
You ready?
Ready.
Look at him.
Yeah, he's ready.
He's not ready.
Commence arm wrestle!
Ain't touching yet!
Take him out!
Take him down!
Starting positions.
Come on.
Come on, stop playing around, boss.
Yeah.
Come on, do it!
Starting position's more comfortable.
Come on, man!
Don't you fucking move, Ray!
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back.
Come on, come on.
It hurt my arm when you moved it down here.
But it really hurt when you had it down here.
See?
Doesn't that hurt your arm when I go like that?
I think it's much worse when it's down here.
Ah, fuck.
Let's go back to starting positions.
It's really much more comfortable.
Take him out now!
You best stay here.
Take him out!
Oh, shit!
Oh!
Grab him.
Stand up, stand up.
He's all yours, boss.
Give me some cell phones.
Y-you're not gonna get any reception up here, boss.
Ray and I are gonna need some privacy.
He's all yours, boss.
Can we talk about this?
Aah!
Gaah!
Now we can talk.
Do you need any money?
No.
Somebody hired you to kill me.
Who is it?
I can make you tell me.
I know it.
It came through a man named Phillip Jeffries.
At least that's the name he gives.
I never met him.
I only talked to him on the phone.
Keep talking.
He set the whole prison thing up with Warden Murphy.
Jeffries says you were gonna kill me.
He said I could get out and stay out if I killed you first.
Why?
He said that you got something inside that they want.
Did he ever mention Major Briggs?
No.
Easy, Ray.
You know I don't have a gun.
I got to show you something.
Oh.
Jeffries said I was supposed to put this on you... after I killed you.
Where did you get that?
It was given to me... right before I walked out of my cell and saw you.
Who gave it to you?
A guard.
I don't know.
He was dressed as a guard, but I'd never seen him before.
Put it on... ring finger, left hand.
Now... you know what I want, Ray.
You want the coordinates I got from Hastings?
Rather, his pretty secretary, Betty?
Do you really think I'm gonna give them to you?
You really think you could even trust the numbers I give you?
I know who you are.
Can I reach in my pocket?
Depends on what's in the pocket.
The numbers, stupid.
I have the coordinates written out.
They're in my pocket.
Here...
Ray, where is Phillip Jeffries?
I don't know.
Ray, where's Phillip Jeffries?
Last I heard, he was at a place called The Dutchman's, but it's not a real place.
I know what it is.
It's... it's about two blocks back.
Try to make a U-turn.
Okay, then jus...
Drive careful.
Mom wants us to come to Sunday dinner.
Hopes there's no murders this weekend.
Fat chance that's gonna happen.
Get her out of here!
She's still pissing, Phil.
I'll get her.
And she's got a knife!
Fuck you, Twinkies!
I'll cut your nuts off!
Tase her, Tase her!
Phil, Tase her!
Get her out of here.
We want to report a cop!
Got the prints on our pal Douglas Jones.
Oh.
According to AFIS, he escaped from a high-security prison in South Dakota two days ago.
He's a missing FBI agent.
That...
That's a huge fucking mistake!
What?
Sure.
Oh!
All right, all right.
Ex... excuse me?
I-I'm looking for Detective Clark.
Yeah, he's out back, grabbing a smoke.
Just through the doors.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hey.
F-fuck.
You know you're not supposed to come here.
I have to ask you a question.
Better be good.
It is.
I need to know a good poison I could use...
Undetectable.
You shit.
What?
Aconitine.
Crime labs are getting wise to it, but it's your best bet.
Where do I get it?
By paying me top fucking dollar, cowboy.
Why are you so against me?
'Cause you're a weak fucking coward.
It makes me sick just to look at you.
I'm trying to keep this whole operation from falling apart.
It's gonna cost you.
Five... thousand.
It'll do the job, give you two hours to get away.
It's perfect for a chickenshit punk like you.
I'll get the money.
Nine-thirty tonight, outside of Crosley's, at the back door.
What's up?
He's cracking.
The fuck wants to poison somebody.
I'll call Mr. Todd.
Yeah.
Utah.
Mormons.
They don't drink liquor.
They don't drink coffee.
They don't drink Coca-Cola.
And... they don't even have sex before marriage.
Yeah, but when they do get married,
I heard they... they can marry, like, six or ten women.
Funny there's not more of them.
I guess it's the drinks.
Oh, Dougie.
Good morning, Dougie.
What do you say to a nice hot cup of coffee?
Coffee.
It's on me.
Coffee for the great Dougie Jones.
Dougie Jones.
Here you go.
Mm.
Ahh.
Hon, you want some cherry pie?
Cherry pie.
Go enjoy your coffee.
Coffee.
Don't worry about it, okay?
Dougie... there's your coffee.
Your coffee.
Oh, God!
Here's your cherry pie.
Oh, oh...
That bad, huh?
Dougie!
Dougie, I'm so sorry!
So sorry!
Mm.
Mm.
Hey, Becky.
Mom...
Steven never came home last night.
That's two nights that he's been gone.
That's two days, Mom.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
I'm really worried.
Well, maybe he just needs some time.
I can feel it.
Okay, honey, can we talk about this later?
Hungry customers.
Sure.
No, you know what?
Why don't you come down here, and I'm gonna serve you up a beautiful piece of cherry pie, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and lots of whipped cream.
Oh... damn, okay.
Ah.
Okay, I'll be right there.
Okay, hurry up, and we'll find some time to talk, okay?
I love you, too.
I...
I can't believe what I've don...
I can't believe what I've become.
I tried poisoning Dougie.
He was so kind about it.
I can't believe what I was about to do.
I have to confess.
Confess.
I will, Dougie.
I will.
Bushnell...
I've been selling you down the river for months and months for Duncan Todd.
I've been working for Todd.
I...
I've lied and cheated for money.
Anthony...
Dougie already showed me.
He explained all this already.
He did?
Now that you're confessing,
I have to admit that my anger, my contempt for you is subsiding.
Dougie even implicated himself.
And he showed me how you manipulated claims, and you cost me plenty.
I trusted you, Anthony.
I looked at you as my friend and my number-one sales agent.
Number-one sales agent.
How can I make it up to you?
I'm so ashamed of what I've done.
And if it weren't for Dougie,
I might have a murder on my hands.
Oh, my God, what can I do?
I was prepared to send you away for a long, long time.
Oh.
But now... are you prepared to testify against Duncan Todd?
Y-yes.
Y-yes.
Yes, even if I die in the process.
I haven't slept for weeks.
I only want to die or change.
Bushnell, please help me.
I only want to make things right again.
And these two cops that Dougie found?
Them, too.
They're worse than Todd.
You don't know what you're asking.
Oh...
I'm not really asking, Anthony.
I-I only want to fix this mess I made.
Dougie saved my life.
Thank you, Dougie.
Thank Dougie.
Thank you.
Thank you.
How are you?
How are you?
Hanging in.
I will have the usual.
Okay.
Yeah, no problem.
Hey, Norma.
Shelly go home already?
Yeah, she did.
Oh, okay.
I'll leave you two.
No, no, come and have some dinner.
Bobby, get your butt back over here.
It's no good eating alone.
Thanks.
So...
What's new, Deputy?
Oh, well, we, uh, found some stuff that my dad left today.
What kind of stuff?
Don't know yet, but it...
Something.
Oh.
Thanks.
We're gonna check it out, though.
I'll tell you that.
I'll go bring your dinner, Ed.
Hey?
You want me to move to another booth?
So you guys can...?
Hey, you.
Hey, girl.
Oh...
You two talk business.
We'll move somewhere else.
Good to see you, Walter.
What's his name again?
Ed.
Ed Hurley.
Oh, right, yeah.
You're looking beautiful.
Well, thanks.
So, uh, to what do I owe this pleasure?
Norma, I had to make the drive 'cause I got last month's reports this morning, and I was so excited to share them with you.
Tell me.
Hmm-mm.
Three of our five Norma's Double R franchises turned a profit.
And that's a huge milestone for such a new brand, particularly when this whole region still faces such uphill challenges economically.
So that's good?
That's very good.
Looking at what's...
Curiously, one of the two that's lagging is this one right here...
Your flagship diner.
Well, business always takes a little dip this time of year.
It's been going on for a few months now.
So I took the liberty of running a point-of-sale analysis between this location and the others.
I-I can't really decipher that.
Could you just tell me what it means?
In black and white, you're spending too much per pie and not charging enough.
Well, look, Walter,
I-I've heard from other people that they think that our pies at the other locations are just not as good as the ones we have here.
I hear you.
And I gave them all my exact recipes, as per our agreement, but I don't think they're following them.
Norma, I assure you they're following your recipes to the letter, but also... per the agreement...
Using their discretion about where they get the ingredients.
Mm, no.
All my ingredients are natural, organic, local.
But this was our agreement.
Norma... you're a real artist.
But love doesn't always turn a profit.
We believe in you 100 percent, but from a business perspective, the board would like you to consider some alternatives without sacrificing any of the high standards that you're so well-known for.
Well, if you can explain the alternatives,
It's just about tweaking the formula to ensure consistency and profitability.
For instance, we think it's really time you changed this name to Norma's Double R.
You know, Walter, in Twin Peaks, it's been the Double R Diner for over 50 years, and that's how people know it.
No disrespect to the Double R, but you'll recall our market research showed people responded so much more favorably to your name...
Norma's Double R, as it should be.
You're the face of the franchise.
Are we on for dinner later?
To celebrate?
Yes, Walter.
So...
Okay, so, just in case...
Oh, my God!
Oh.
Dr. Jacoby.
Nadine.
Can I call you Dr. Amp?
That's me.
I usually leave out the back.
Oh, my God!
I love your show so much.
You have done so much for me.
Oh.
Do you like it?
It... it's magnificent.
And those drapes are completely silent.
This is my tribute to you, Dr. Amp.
Thanks to you,
I am really starting to shovel myself out of the shit!
Oh, Nadine.
That... that just means the world to me.
It really does.
You... you know, it's...
It's us against them.
And I am your most loyal foot soldier... or... shoveler.
You were down on your hands and knees, looking for a potato.
Where was I?
It was, uh, you know, in the supermarket.
You... you had dropped it.
Oh.
Oh, the right hand catches the big guy by the ear!
And he finally goes down, hangs onto the ropes.
Oh, the gentleman asks him if he's okay.
Looks like, uh, round number one and two under way.
Now it's a boxing match again.

What did she say?
Audrey... we've been over this.
Tell me!
Audrey.
Stop it.
I d...
I feel like I'm somewhere else.
Have you ever had that feeling, Charlie?
No.
Like I'm somewhere else and... and like I'm somebody else.
Have you ever felt that?
No.
I always feel like myself.
And it may not always be the best feeling.
Well, I'm not sure who I am, but I'm not me.
This is Existentialism 101.
Oh, fuck you!
I'm serious!
Who am I supposed to trust but myself?
And I don't even know who I am!
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
You're supposed to go to the Roadhouse and see if Billy is there.
I guess.
Is it far?
Come on, Audrey, you know where it is.
If I didn't know better, I would swear you were on drugs.
Just where is it?
I'm gonna take you there.
Now, are you gonna stop playing games, or do I have to end your story, too?
What story is that, Charlie?
Is that the story of the little girl who lived down the lane?
Is it?
You're the one that wanted to go.
Now you're looking like you want to stay.
I want to stay, and I want to go.
I want to do both.
Which will it be, Charlie?
Hmm?
Which one would you be?
Charlie, help me.
It's like Ghostwood here.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Roadhouse is proud to welcome
James Hurley.
