[cameraman] Shooting.
[shutters clicking]
Let's see those curves, yeah.
Smile.
Yeah.
[Bailey] This year was my first year owning my own company.
[clicks]
I can do whatever I want, whenever I want.
I've never had that kind of freedom before.
-[chuckles] -[man] The same background.
[cameraman] Yeah, side profile kind of.
[camera shutter clicking]
[Bailey] The Bailey Rayne brand is very classy, girl next door...
I am empowered.
[cameraman] And just walk off frame.
[Bailey] Of all the decisions I've made... this is my best one.

[automated voice] Keep right toward LAX Airport all terminals.
[Bailey] There we go.
Hello, beautiful!
[both chuckle]
[Eva laughing] It's nice to meet you finally!
You can get a lot of business experience here, too.
Like, I own my own business now.
I've had a very successful, empowering, positive career in porn.
[both chuckling]
[Bailey] I'm an assistant agent, which means I help recruit girls and mentor new girls into the porn industry.
[Bailey] I know.
I try to help them be more business-oriented.
Anyone can be taught how to do this... if you have someone guiding you.
[Bonnie chuckling]
[Bonnie] I've never been in California before.
I'm so excited.
[Bailey chuckles]
Yeah, you guys will have to take me sightseeing.
[Bailey] I'm from Indiana.
So, you're here to shoot, girl-girl and solo, right?
[Eva] Yes.
Right now, I'm thinking just solo and girl-girl.
Girls that do, like, one or two things.
[Eva] It's nice that you can make that decision.
[Bailey] I think that's really important, too, that you... you have that power to make that decision.
I'm trying my best to create for these girls just a really safe environment for them to do what they wanna do.
I want them all to have the best experience they can have.
As women, we need to watch out for each other.
[car door closes]
So, has Bailey been nice to you so far?
Come upstairs, we will show you your little hideout.
[Bailey] Well, you guys are gonna see like a lot of girls today.
Everyone knows he's a great agent.
[Bailey] He always gets his girls gigs, like, he cares about us.
That's why when John asked me to come onboard,
I was so excited 'cause I know he's doing a great thing here in the industry.
We have, um, one downstairs unit.
And then you guys will be up here.
[Bonnie] Nice to meet you.
[John] We've been in business a little over 18 years.
Come on, that's Megan hiding over there.
The relationship that I've established with girls I've worked for, you know, is that they, you know, trust me completely.
It's almost like, you know, I'm like a father figure.
Now that you're here, you can, like...
You should text everyone at home and tell them that...
-We haven't-- -[Bonnie] It's not weird.
We haven't sold you to, like, you know, a slave camp.
[all chuckle]
Yeah, I figured I should just get it off my chest.
But my dad doesn't know.
But I imagine he'll probably find out.
That's a surprise you may not want him to experience on his own.
New peeps with me.
[Bonnie] All right, good. [chuckles]
[Bonnie] I was nervous about coming to LA by myself... but I think Bailey is a very genuine person.
She really cares that I don't have, like, a bad experience in the industry.
[girls scream and laugh] [cheering]
[Bonnie] Look, I got my toes wet.
[Eva] We did it.
[chuckles] Yeah.
[Bailey] My business is built on multiple revenue streams.
I'm recruiting and bringing in a lot of people, but... there's also porn shoots, selling my own content and camming.
You wanna guess what color thong I'm wearing?
How do you know I'm wearing a thong?
[chuckles]
You're such a hooligan.
A cam model performs live shows on a webcam.
Usually do sexual acts for money.
[computer chimes]
[Bailey] Thank you, Dave!
We have the ability to sit in our home and maybe flash every once in a while and get tips.
-[computer chimes] -[Bailey] Thank you.
It's... it's a job...
It's a legitimate job.
And most successful girls treat it like a legitimate job.
When people come into my cam room...
I can look at their stats.
I can see how many tokens they've ever purchased, how many tokens they have in their account right now... and, you know, decide whether or not I wanna give them the time of day.
I know that sounds horrible, but I do have to pick and choose who I give my attention to.
Just this month,
I have one member who has tipped $800 before taxes.
I really like statistics.
I know not many people would admit to that. [chuckles]
I do sit at my computer and just look at stats and pie charts all day.
Panties.
Like, you can make a ton of money just selling panties.
It comes with a Polaroid of me wearing them.
Not while I was in high school. [chuckles]
I'll put it on eBay and, like, advertise that it comes with a video.
This is the Bailey Rayne issue of Penthouse.
I advertise these on cam.
[chuckles]
Before all of this...
I grew up in conservative Indiana and sex was bad.
We tried to have sex ed in my high school, and the parents stormed the office because they saw it as promoting sex.
We had the second highest pregnancy rate in the state.
I didn't even know what an orgasm was until my third year of college.
That was the first time a boy actually got me off.
And I was, like... confused.
[chuckles] I was like, "Wait, what was that?"
I didn't even know what my body looked like until I started camming.
[chuckles]
While I was in college, I had two or three jobs.
I worked my ass off and lived off of ramen and instant mashed potatoes.
Like... [inhales sharply] I never wanna go back to that.
[computer chimes]
Whoa!
MadMatt!
Did you, like, hit an extra number on accident?
Oh, my God!
It would have taken me until I was 46 to pay off my student loans.
Thank you!
And I was actually in line to start a full-time teaching job, an assistant job.
And it started at $20,000 a year.
And I make eight times that.
-[computer chimes] -[chuckles]
Now, helping these girls feeds the woman in me.
You know, I taught because I loved it.
And in a way, I've found a way to teach again.
[chuckles] Thank you.
When I first started camming, I didn't have anyone there to kind of guide me through the whole process.
I was uncomfortable a lot.
All right, the dress is coming off. [chuckles]
There will always be people who wanna push your limits.
It's actually a turn on to a lot of people to see you uncomfortable.
And I had to learn that the hard way.
[Bailey] Today, you guys will kind of get a feel for... what these producers can see you, like, really fitting into.
Being able to do a lot of different things is kind of important in our industry.
You guys need to form LLC's.
And John and I can walk you through that.
Do it as soon as possible because your tax rate will go down significantly.
[Bonnie] I don't have, like, a bank account or anything.
[Bailey] You don't?
-[chuckles] -[Eva] I love it.
[Renae chuckles]
Girls, why don't you sit over here.
Okay.
So, you girls started when?
So I've been doing that on my own.
But I haven't done anything professional yet.
[Renae] Mmm-hmm, and you?
Uh, just solo.
[Renae] So, you've never done a boy on camera?
[chuckling]
[Renae] Could be interesting.
Okay, and what type of guy are you interested in?
That you're attracted to, not interested in.
Okay, who wants to get their pictures taken first?
I love Bonnie's look.
[Renae] Don't pout.
She's my dream... because she's got the butt, she's got the boobs, she's got the face.
But she's not comfortable doing boys, so I have to adjust and accept the fact that that's what she wants.
And hopefully, one day, she'll change her mind. [chuckles]
And give me what, you know, what I think I can get from her.
[Bonnie] She... she wants me to do boy-girl, doesn't she?
[Bailey] You don't have to work for them first.
There are so many other companies, you don't ever have to be pressured.
[Bailey] I really wanna help these girls understand.
They should never, ever be uncomfortable.
[Bailey] I am a feminist working in this industry.
I know I'm a sex object, but I control everything.
I don't like doing anything degrading.
That's why I shoot solo.
So, if it's degrading, it's me degrading myself.
If the only way to pay my bills was to do something I was uncomfortable with,
I would not be empowered.
Boy, you guys look innocent.
-[girls chuckle] -[Bonnie] That's good, right?
You look like a young Anna Nicole Smith, maybe, a little bit.
Oh, thank you.
Like a wholesome-looking, like, Texas girl.
-Business. [chuckles] -[Eva chuckles] Yeah.
You know, you're not just gonna be able to make a living doing porn.
You're gonna have to learn more, you know?
There's only so much money being spent on producing because... young people like you don't pay for porn anymore, do you?
Uh, I just wanna wait, hold off on boy-girl.
[chuckling]
I don't even have to see 'em and I know they're beautiful.
[Bonnie] I've been thinking about doing porn for a while now, actually.
And I decided to come out here.
[manager] Unbelievable.
[Bonnie] I plan on making as much money as possible.
I wanna be able to make a significant change for my family.
I wanna be able to take care of my mom for the rest of her life.
[manager] Look at those things.
[chuckles] [manager] Rebecca, make sure they're real for us.
[Bailey] They're pretty real.
So...
I just wanna be able to do that while they're still young.
[computer chimes]
[laughs]
[Salena] I need to send that to Snapchat.
[Bailey] I find girls on cam sites.
[Salena] You're Dark Knight times ten now!
[Bailey] I get paid per girl that I bring out.
[Salena] All right, let's get to it!
[Salena] Also, they don't know that I have, uh, buns of steel.
But I do.
[spanking]
[Bailey] I contacted Salena.
And she responded, like, right away.
She was really excited.
Which is really important when I'm recruiting people.
I want them to be really excited about this before they come out.
[Salena] All right, we're live!
[laughs]
Howdy, BigToe.
One, two, three, four...
My name is Salena Storm.
I am 20 years old.
Six...
I work full-time on cam.
And I support myself fully.
I don't have to ask anyone for anything.
Pay my own bills.
I love what I do.
I love the sense of accomplishment I get when I get offline and I get to see what I made.
I think I have my breath back.
My room, it's been doing great, but I want it to do better.
So, back to being weird. [laughs]
That's why I wanted to break into the porn industry to just get my name out there.
And then redirect them into my room.
[Salena speaks indistinctly] Whoo!
I think that'll take her really far.
She's actually not gonna need a lot of coaching.
[Bonnie grunts]
[Bonnie] Ooh!
We could do that in a video!
[Bonnie] I miss my hoops.
Do you wanna do squirt or anal for your video today?
We have time for one.
Okay, yeah, I don't wanna do anal today.
Just because I wanted to, like, watch other people's videos.
I really look up to her, too.
She definitely is a role model, you know...
If it wouldn't have been for her,
I would have done boy-girl immediately, right off the bat.
[Bonnie] I just have the white bra and panty set.
Well, I really like that top.
[both laugh]
[Bonnie] You know, I hope that I can be more like her.
And keep a level head.
Especially if I do start making, you know, substantial money.
I hope that I can... be responsible, and make responsible choices.
So, I just want you to stand there and, you know... just kinda feel yourself for a little bit, and then I'll say, "All right, you can take off your...
[Bonnie giggles]
-[spanking] -[Bonnie moans]
[Bailey] Controlling your own content is the most important thing in this industry.
She gets to keep the clips.
I actually upload them to her very own clip store, where she can sell them and make money forever, like, they never go away.
[Bonnie breathing heavily and moaning]
[Bailey] Change positions.
[Bailey] I've set this up to where it does benefit me, too.
Instead of charging her, I just keep the clips and sell them on my own store, too.
That's business.
It's not pee, though.
'Cause for some reason, when you say it's pee, guys are like,
It'll activate my magical vagina juices, if I drink water. [laughs]
And... action.
[Bailey] It's awesome.
Your fans are gonna wanna see more, and more, and more.
It's kind of a cool little circle.
[Bonnie moans and kisses] [chiming]
[Bailey] And it's all ready to go.
"And it's my best orgasm of my career!"
[birds chirping]
I'm doing good.
[Bailey] Salena lives in San Diego.
So, she'll be able to drive up regularly and shoot, and work with us.
And she'll still be able to live at home.
Tell me a little bit about yourself.
[Salena] Um, just like...
I really just want to get into this industry to really just cross-promote my cam world.
And so, primarily, you're interested in just doing, like, solo and girl-girl work.
[Salena] I'm interested in doing, yes, solo and girl-girl.
[John] And how successful are you interested in becoming?
As big as I can get.
I mean, the more followers I get, the more people are gonna be interested seeing me live.
So, I'm all for it. [chuckles]
[Bailey] As long as you're comfortable, there's nothing wrong with expressing your sexuality.
If anything, I find it empowering.
[Bailey] It turns me on, like, watching myself on the cam.
And seeing that number of people in the room.
[John] This photographer, his name is J Rock.
He shoots for several...
Probably, like, four or five different companies.
[J Rock] So, tell me about you.
Uh, I'm from San Diego.
[Salena] Um, professional porn, no experience.
But... uh, with camming,
Very comfortable.
[J Rock] That's the good answer.
-[camera beeps] -[shutter clicks]
[Salena] In this industry, sometimes you do get treated like a piece of meat.
[J Rock] Skinny girl with a booty!
[Salena] It could be demoralizing to always just be objectified.
[Salena] But I think it is possible to be empowered and still be a sex object.
As long as you're okay with what you're doing and you know what kind of life you're building for yourself.
[J Rock] She's a perfect Victoria's Secret model.
Growing up, my parents, they owned a very lucrative business.
[J Rock] Spread your legs more apart.
[J Rock] Nice!
[Salena] Seeing my parents fail scared me.
And I told myself I will never do that!
[J Rock] Okay, booty shots!
-[shutter clicks] -[J Rock] Beautiful!
It's just that thing inside of me that says,
But, like, how did you decide that you wanted to get into this?
Um, I just thought, like, "Oh, I can do that," you know.
Wow!
And I just knew that I could handle... [chuckles] I can handle it.
But... never do anything you're not comfortable with.
You don't have to be that kind of girl to be successful.
[Bailey] Mmm-mmm.
[Salena] As far as Bonnie is concerned...
I feel like she's pretty naive to everything.
[Bonnie] Two days ago, I had to do like a... you know, masturbate in public, whatever.
And, you know... [chuckles]
[Salena] But, like, can't you get in trouble?
Isn't that illegal?
'Cause, like, you're registered on the sex offender list.
[Salena] I feel like she could get taken advantage of.
I'm just scared for her, to be quite frank.
Just based off of what I've heard her talk about today.
[car horns honking]
I was a stripper.
I stopped dancing because it was really hard on my body.
You know, you're grinding on them and... they'll try and stick their fingers, like, in my panties.
Like, that gets really old, telling people no.
Really wore on me.
Yeah, just bring, you know, like, some little skirts, dresses, some panties and bras.
I hope that I'm more comfortable with porn.
[Bailey] Here, let me post you on my Snapchat.
Like, have one for everyone that's just like, "Oh, yeah, this chick's really hot,"
and then, be like, "If you wanna see the dirty stuff, you better buy my Snapchat for $30 or whatever for a month."
And then you make, like, a business.
All right, here we go.
[Bailey] So are you guys excited that your first shoot is, like, together?
[Bonnie] I know.
[Bailey] Did you guys practice at all?
-I practiced with Zoey. [chuckles] -[Eva] What is there to practice?
[Bailey] Oh, so, you haven't done a girl-girl thing
[Bailey] Hmm, it was probably a good thing you practiced with Zoey.
[birds chirping]
This looks like a prairie. [chuckles]
[Bonnie] After I do this... first gig... like, I can't ever act like I didn't do this.
I don't want to just, like, do it and then, kind of, crash and burn, you know.
Mostly nervous about, like, people from my hometown finding out.
They're very conservative.
So I know they're gonna be really upset about this.
You know, nobody wants their, like, daughter or granddaughter to do this.
-[Bonnie laughing] -[cameraman] Time to get set up here.
[Bailey] So...
[Bailey] Video as much as you can now... so that later on, on clip sites and stuff, you can advertise it as...
Or, like, "Me diddling myself on the sofa in high school."
"Me diddling myself against a mirror in high school."
Like, "in high school, in high school, in high school."
[indistinct chatter]
[cameraman] Anybody need a douche or anything like that?
Let's get 'em all out there, J.
And... action!
Jessica, I do like you, but I like Kristen, too.
You can look down at Kristen when you say that, then look back up at her almost, like, pleading,
"Can't we just have an orgy?"
Ready, and action!
Jessica, I do like you, but I like Kristen, too.
Good. "You should probably come here, Jessica.
And... action!
I think we should probably start undressing her.
Ew, that was really gross.
[coughing]
[Bonnie] What did you guys do before you, like, did porn?
[Zoey] No, I was a waitress.
I wasn't camming, I wasn't stripping.
I was just like, "I wanna do porn and not wait tables anymore."
So that's what I did.
I wanna start stripping though, at some point.
Working in the strip club made me hate men. [laughs]
I'm just disgusted.
I just feel like it, like, sucked the life outta me.
[Zoey] Mmm-hmm.
[Bonnie] It would be nice to be able to, like, establish myself without ever having to, you know, make the jump from solo and girl-girl to boy-girl.
Because that's just a whole other world.
My stepdad was an avid porn watcher.
So, first time I ever saw a pop-up porn ad...
I was six or seven years old.
From then I would, like... you know, I would look at it every night.
I think it definitely made me think about sex at a really young age.
My breasts grew in when I was 11.
I did get a lot of negative attention that way.
Boys said...
I look like quote-unquote, "slut."
When I was 12, I lost my virginity.
He was 17, so he was five years older than me.
I wish it wouldn't have happened like that.
You guys don't want to do anything tonight?
[Bonnie] Yeah.
Yeah.
[cell phone ringing]
[Bonnie over phone] Um, not feeling that great, actually.
I had, like, a really bad fever last night.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!
Did you tell John?
Yeah, I was actually about to ask him to come over here.
Then have him take you to a Minute Clinic?
Yeah, no, the reason that I probably have a really bad fever is because I ate, like, a bunch of Molly.
I'm, like, completely broke because I'm stupid and I don't know how to manage my money. [chuckles]
[Bailey] She was supposed to buy a computer, she didn't do it.
It's just... [sighs]
I'm concerned.
[Bonnie over phone] I'm so stupid.
[Bailey] If you need to get high in order to cope with this job... that is not healthy.
You're not in total control of your body.
You can get hurt if you have to be high.
Girls get ripped because of that.
[Bailey] So, what does this text mean?
Like, sugar daddy.
Um, yes.
John would not be okay with that.
We've had a few girls, like, do stuff like that and it...
It always ends the same way.
It's usually a girl that just gets strung out on crazy drugs and then we never see her again.
[Bailey sighs]
That I'm gonna be well taken care of.
$500 to go to lunch with him.
That's a lot of money for a lunch.
Yeah, I'm gonna say if someone's paying for your time...
You don't have to call it escorting. [chuckles]
[Bailey] I'm just saying that most people do.
And John kinda trusted me to steer you guys in the right direction.
[Bailey] Girls just disappear.
The industry is not for everyone, the adult industry... it can be a very scary place.
[keys jangling]
-[door creaking] -[Bailey gasps]
Hey, guys!
We don't have a lot of people outside of the industry that we can talk to.
It's part of being in the industry.
Thank you so much!
Yeah, you're literally taking me out. [chuckles]
My social life is on cam.
I call my mom but I can't talk about, you know, work.
[sighs] They... they don't know.
I don't want my mom to see pictures of the little girl as she remembers her, like, spreading it wide on camera.
[chuckles] That's a show.
Hey, guys!
[Bailey] It doesn't matter how I'm feeling.
Hey, Baffy!
It's 14 hours a day of happy.
Raffle position.
[Bailey] If I bring my personal life into the cam room, a lot of guys will just say, um,
"She's just making it up 'cause she wants pity tokens."
I have five new videos on my profile.
But I can't leave.
I literally can't stop looking at that screen.
I constantly have to stare at that screen and say,
Hey, there, mountaindome.
[gasps]
Um, I've been on my period for two weeks now because I tried to skip it this month.
Um, I skipped the sugar pills... and I think, um... bleeding for that long is really taking a toll on my body.
I'm just gonna stay on cam for the whole time I'm supposed to and... log out and go to bed.
[chuckles]
I'll be back in a bit.
[doorbell rings]
Have a seat.
So, how has life been?
Is anyone in the other room?
No.
Okay, I am really worried about Bonnie.
[Bonnie on video] Hello.
So I figured out where I was going.
I took some Xanax, so I, like, I was kind of out of it.
I've never done anything naughty on a plane.
I just get guys to buy me drinks.
I am naughty.
[Bailey] She is flashing on a plane.
Just frustrating to watch.
I don't understand what is going on in her head.
Yep.
Mmm-hmm.
Completely out of control.
But, the simple reality is, if we turn around and say, you know,
"Okay, you know, we're not gonna work with you anymore."
Then, fine, she'll just go to another agency, you know?
And they don't give a crap, you know?
They'll probably be feeding her Xanax.
[inhales] Um... [stammering] You know, in all honesty,
I can sit and talk to the girls and go, "You know, you just really have to be careful."
But, you know, beyond that, it's, like, you know... been there, done it.
Whatever.
Look, the bottom line is... what possibly can we do?
[Bailey] I am disappointed.
I don't see John being able to do anything.
I think he may be a little too business-minded.
Some things, you need to put your heart into it.
Nice to meet you.
How's your day going?
So, how was the flight in last night?
How're you feeling about what's gonna go on today?
[Bonnie] I just got back to LA from Vegas and I just stayed the night and flew back this morning.
Cute. [chuckles softly]
This is so cute.
Oh, and this is cute, too.
[chuckles]
I started doing boy-girl, like, two weeks ago.
I'm glad that I started doing boy-girl.
I bet my little sister would like this, actually.
[chuckles]
Heck, yeah.
I wanted to change my name before I started doing boy-girl because I just wanted to, like, be more authentic to myself and I thought that
I should just go by my first name which is Kylie.
So, I decided that, like, 30 minutes before I started doing my first scene for Casting Couch. [chuckles]
I did a boy-girl-girl scene and...
I got ripped... but I'm just like...
It's just like, on the outside, so it only hurts, like, whenever you put it in, really.
So I can, like, get through it.
So, I'm just trying to get through, like, this next week, really, and it hurts, but... [chuckles]
It's, like, it's okay.
It goes away once, like, once you get going, but... [sniffles]
[Bailey] Bonnie is very afraid of disappearing and fizzling out.
Doing boy-girl,
I think she may be making herself uncomfortable... but she's telling herself it's what she wants.
[Bonnie] I like doing this.
It's fun, like, I like it.
[line ringing]
Um, does she need to go to a doctor?
Oh, my God!
Are you sure she doesn't need to go to a hospital or something?
Okay.
[sighs]
He said that she partied too hard last night.
[John] What's up?
[Bailey] Hello.
[John] She just went out clubbing all night.
She's had the kidney infection for like... two or three weeks.
[Bailey] She's drinking with a kidney infection?
She's... 19.
Nineteen-year-olds who like to go out and play.
Bonnie?
[sighing]
It's very frustrating to watch.
I feel like I'm part of, kind of a... a vicious circle.
She had no idea I was even in there.
Like... at all.
If... if I ask her about it later, she'll have absolutely no memory of me being in her room.
[sighs heavily]
Saying, "Bonnie, you need to go home,"
wouldn't make much sense because it's their choice.
[knocks on door]
[Bailey] I really like Jordan.
With Bonnie, I can't have that in my day-to-day life.
[Bailey] Watching someone spiral out of control is... is always gonna be kind of heartbreaking, but... [inhales deeply] we are all competitive and so the business side of me just kinda kicks in, like,
"Well, maybe she won't be around very long." [chuckles]
It's terrible but that's how business is.
So, when girls first get into the industry,
