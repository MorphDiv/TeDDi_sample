My name is Oliver Queen.
After 5 years in Hell,
I returned home with only one goal-- to save my city.
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.
By day, I lead Star City as its mayor, but by night, I am someone else.
I am...

I am the Green Arrow.
Previously on "Arrow"...
You want to help?
Yeah.
Stay off the streets.
It's my city, too.
I came here to work with the guy who killed Damien Darhk.
So you're ex-Navy, right?
Dishonorably discharged.
Reason?
Because I screwed up...
Again.
That's my life, man.
I'm wearing this suit again because I think it's a path to redemption, and it could be for you, too.
But finding a new Black Canary isn't just about reviewing resumes.
Tina Boland, formerly of the CCPD.
She's a kick-ass woman who appears out of nowhere and saves crime victims.
She even has a cry.
Our Tina is trying to avenge her former partner.
Please!
How do you keep living with so much pain?
I can tell you it helps to not be alone.
My real name is Dinah--
Dinah Drake.

== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
I've got something.
Well, not something-something but something.
That's good work.
I didn't know they taught Bo staff at the Central City police academy.
They don't.

They liked to mess around with it.
I'm gonna head home.
Yeah.

No.

HIVE?

It's fine.

See you, man.
What do you guys got?
Well, I have been working on a location for Claybourne's mistress.
Prometheus' mother.

We find the name for this son of a bitch.
Eh, unfortunately, the-- the son of a bitch's father went dark after he met with the pointy head of an arrow
4 years ago, and mommy went off the grid.
Why would she do that?
Probably because she knows that he turned into a serial killing psychopath nutjob.
Point being I have been looking for her for the past 3 months, but whatever witness protection program she put herself into, it is damn good.
What changed in 3 months?
I've had a breakthrough.
I've narrowed her new home down to Illinois.
I just need a couple more days to narrow that down into an address.
That's fantastic work.
Thank you.

He's gonna help with the search.
It's really nice to have you back.
Well, I could say the same to you.
I mean, Hub City and Russia.
You're really racking up those miles.
- A lot to catch up on.

Like you and Susan Williams?
People talk, Ollie, and, uh, some people vomit a little.
Thea, you're kind of insulting someone that I'm getting pretty serious about.
Did I mention people vomit a little?
You don't like Susan because of how she does her job.
She's good at her job, and she's a good person.
So there.
Uh-huh.
- Quentin!

Oh, so good to see you.
And you, too.
I saw your interview with the dragon lady, and you nailed it.
Uh, that's his girlfriend you're talking about there.
Yes.

What are you doing here?
You, uh, prosecuting him for something?
Uh, actually, Quentin was just introducing us.
I'm the new deputy mayor's assistant.
I, uh... never should have left.
Well, uh, talking of leaving,
I got to get across town for an alderman meeting.
Uh, you need me to come with?
Nice try, but those regulatory forms are not gonna fill themselves out.
I'm just saying that maybe you could get
Susan Williams to back off.
Bottom line--I'm not comfortable leveraging a personal relationship for political gain.
The media's right, man.
You're not much of a politician.
As it is, I'm not comfortable covering up the circumstances surrounding the death of Detective Malone.
So maybe if Susan Williams--
Mister--Mr.

- There's a shooter in the building.

Woman, voice-over:

Zoe's gonna totally kill you if you guys are late to the game.
What?
No way we'll be late, not the way I drive.
Whoo!

Whoa.
What do you think you're doing?
Stadium's in the Glades, babe, in like the worst part of the worst part of town.
I brought it with me last time I took Zoe.
So you're admitting you broke the rule?
Kind of what I do, babe.
The only reason I agree to let you keep that thing in the house is because you said we needed it for home protection.
- Right back-- - as in, stays in the home.
Now, hurry up.
You guys are gonna be late.
I thought we were going as a family.
I have a headache.
Oh, yeah?

You got something you want to say to me, Rene?
I guess I do.
Using again?
The shooter's Mia.

Alert the SCPD and the ACU.
Drop a 5-block net around city hall.
Let's get ambulances here immediately!
And has anyone seen my sister?

Ollie.
Hey, are you all right?

Adrian!
You're gonna be ok.
Just catch this son of a bitch.
Yeah.

How many casualties?
There's 5 dead, 24 injured, and 8 in critical condition.
The bastard was wearing Kevlar, but I think one of my shots went into his shoulder with a 9-mil slug.
Might be a good idea to alert all the emergency rooms?
Do it.
What were you doing with a gun in here?
Judging by how I tagged the guy,
I got to go with saving people's lives.
Your security detail said the shooter dropped his primary weapon.
We need to get it before the police do.
I took care of it.
This is military-grade hardware.
AR-15 assault weapon.
It fires 5.56 NATO rounds.
It's an M16.

Seems like some of Tobias Church's ordnance got into the wrong hand-- wronger hands.
Not necessarily.

It's available on the open market.
In fact, it's the most popular gun in America.
The land of the free, home of the incredibly stupid.
We are not having this conversation now or ever, guys.
Where are we with the gun?
Nowhere.

Fingerprints?
The shooter wasn't wearing gloves.
AFIS didn't kick back anything.
I don't think he's ever been in the system.
Or he was smart enough to have himself erased from it.
Security cameras.
He knew how to avoid them.
And before he opened fire, he upgraded to a ski mask.
That looks like a utility jumpsuit.
Forefather Repair.
It went belly up 6 years ago.
I ran through the employee list, but I think our shooter just bought a uniform off the Internet.
So he could walk into city hall.
This guy's real good at covering his tracks, whoever he is.
So who is he?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That--there.

Run him through the system for me, would you?
Hey, this is where you've been.
I think I got a look at the shooter before he put his ski mask on.
I let that son of a bitch walk right past me.
Hey, you couldn't have known, Hoss.
Listen, I've been police most of my adult life.
I should've been able to spot that guy a thousand yards out.
Hey, don't go there, man, all right?
What happened wasn't your fault.
I heard you got a few shots off.
Yeah.

Listen, weren't you dishonorably discharged?
Not for my aim, Hoss.
My point is it's illegal for someone such as yourself to carry a firearm.
But it's pretty easy to buy one, though.
Wow.
Am I using again?
How could you even ask me something like that?
Actually, I've been working up the nerve to ask you for a while now!
Ever since I found this taped behind your dresser drawer.
You searched our bedroom?
Yeah, 'cause it looks like my wife's a freakin' junkie.
I just...
I just don't get it.
We got out, Laura.
We got out of the Glades, and here you are bringing it back into our home.
You are the last person who can get on their high horse.
No matter what I've done, I've never done drugs, and I've never done it in our baby girl's home.
Screw you, Rene!
We're gonna be late for the game.
Hey.

I'm sorry.

You were fighting.
No, we were just talking loudly.
Daddy's just disappointed that mommy's not coming with us to the game.
Go get your coat, honey.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
I'm throwing this away.
When I get home, either there's no more drugs in this house or there's no more you in this house.
Two of the victims who were in critical condition just passed away on the table.
Who?
Kyle in commerce and Paula in accounting.
Ohh.
I need phone numbers for the next of kin.
I already emailed them to you.
Look, you are gonna find whoever did this.
No.

What makes you so sure this isn't just a one-time thing?
If it were a one-time thing, he wouldn't have concealed his identity and he wouldn't have fled the scene.

Uh, Adrian?
Oh, what are you doing?
Can you talk some sense into him, please?
Mr. Mayor, Thea, meet my wife--Doris.
Hi.
He's gonna get himself killed.

I'm tougher than I look, and I need to be in the office.
You need to be in bed, Adrian.

I'm fine.
You look like you're about to pass out.
Hey, listen, come on, buddy.

All right.
What do we know?
We don't know much.
It was a single shooter, AR-15 assault rifle.
And it-- it doesn't appear that I was his primary target because he just...
Blasted his way through city hall.
If he wasn't going after you, then there's a larger agenda here.
AR-15s are the Bertinelli family's weapon of choice.
Over 90% of the hits they were involved in last year used them.
Why would the Bertinellis target city hall?
Because your office oversees the Anti-Crime unit.
And it is a softer target.
All right.

Let yourself get better.
Fair?
Fair.
Just stop this guy.
Whoever he is, he's not in the system.
What if instead of tracking him, we tracked the assault weapon?
Rifle.

Said he was following up a lead.
There's no gun ownership database for me to go through anyway.
Yeah.

So the government doesn't know our business, Hoss.
Guys, can we please, just not right now?
I don't have no problem with your right to bear arms so long as it doesn't conflict with my right to, you know, live.
Are you kidding me?

Our whole life is violence.
I'm not talking about what we do to protect the city.
I'm talking about the fact that as a black man
I am 3 times more likely to be killed by a gun than you.
He's got a point, Rene.
Seriously?

And cops would kind of like it if there were less people out there with guns.
Not this cop.
I mean, people have a right to protect themselves.
Dinah Drake.
Hi.
You guys are really serious about this recruitment drive you got going, huh?
Dinah and I tried to get more information on the shooting out of ESU.
We struck out.
We started trying to track the shooter by using the gun, but then we got a little distracted again with our gun control debate.
Gun violence debate.
Here we go again.
Guys, stop.
Actually, this could be cathartic.

No.

What do you got?
Wait.

This is the AR-15 assault rifle that was used in the attack on city hall.
Which one of your guys did it?
You--you're crazy!
Huh.

Your guys use this exact weapon.
Yeah.

The ACU.
We'd have to be crazier than you to go to war with Anti-Crime.
Yeah.

I'd know it.
And that man would be dead.
Heh.

Are you gonna let me down or shoot me?
Don't move.
I just did you a favor.
One less criminal on the street.
Cold-blooded murder.
You're the criminal.
I'm you.
And the only difference between us is
I use a more efficient weapon.
- Oliver.

I've got the name of our shooter.
Who is he?
Well, that's the thing.
He's a 44-year-old systems analyst with no criminal record.
He's...

James Edlund-- husband and father of two daughters, ages 9 and 11.
Until 16 months ago.
What happened 16 months ago?
Crosspoint Mall shooting.
We're coming to you live at the mass shooting at Crosspoint Mall today.
We must warn our viewers as to the graphic nature of...
Edlund lost his whole family.
Online, Edlund was a pretty vocal proponent of the SCGR.
Oh.

It's the Star City gun registry.
The previous city leadership shot it down.
No pun intended.
So city hall doesn't pass a gun law, this guy loses his whole family and takes revenge.
Where is he now?
That's the thing.
After the funeral, he quit his job and his house is in foreclosure.
He's between the cracks now.
Well, I mean, he's somewhere.
Ollie, I ca--I can't hold them off any longer.
Ok, Quentin, we have to make a statement.
Share the Edlund information with the SCPD, and then we hit the streets and we find this guy.
- 18 people, by the way.

The mall shooting.

Look, I know where you're going with this, but the feds had an assault weapons ban for years, and it did nothing.
- Actually, it did--

But if the bad guys got guns, then I'm strapping up, too.
♪ go, dogs, hoo, hoo, hoo!

♪ Go, dogs, hoo, hoo, hoo ♪
Yeah.

So awesome.

Of course.
Daddy?
Everything's fine, sweetheart.
Um, go get your PJ's on and get ready for bed.
I'm gonna go check on mommy, all right?
At this time, our thoughts and our prayers are with the injured and the loved ones of the fallen.
This office is working tirelessly with the SCPD and the Anti-Crime unit to make sure that Mr. Edlund, the perpetrator of this heinous act of violence, is apprehended and swiftly brought to justice.
I will be taking questions now.
Do you have any comments on rumors that this shooting was in retaliation for the preceding administration's failure to pass the gun control ordinance?
Mr. Edlund is clearly a disturbed individual, but I can't comment on his motivations at this time.
What is your administration's position on the Star City gun registry?
That we will be looking into it further.
What's your administration's position on gun control?
We're gonna examine all sides of that.
What is your personal opinion?
That it's complicated.
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but 7 of your staffers are dead and others severely injured.
Don't you think you owe them a response beyond "it's complicated"?
I do.

I don't owe it to any of you.
We're done here.

Ok.

Vultures, all of them.
No.

I don't know how to deal with this.
You are dealing with this.
An--and Edlund, we will find--
Then what?

The 7 people that we lost are still dead.
My mission has always been to save this city.
And my first instinct has almost always been to use violence.
You didn't bring this on.
I know.

It's a violent world.
And sometimes it only responds to violence, but we cannot dismiss the idea that we are just feeding into a vicious cycle.
If you ask me, this is a problem that the Green Arrow can't solve.
I mean, sure, you can find him.
You probably will.
But this...
This is bigger than one nut bar with a bag full of guns.
He's right.
The solution here is not with you as the Green Arrow, it's with you as the mayor.
I just showed the entire city that I don't know how to handle this as the mayor.
So you try again.
And if that doesn't work, damn it, you try again.
Nobody said being mayor of this city was ever gonna be easy, Oliver.
We need a list.
Every alderman, councilman, and community leader that was involved in the previous gun control ordinance,
I want them in here.
I want to meet with them today.
We're not gonna solve this right away.
Are you sure that you want to open that can of worms?

I--I just mean that gun control is a big political third rail.

Thea, come on.
Thea, I understand.
This shouldn't be about politics.
This should be about safety and security-- everyone's safety and security whether they own a gun or not.
Now, let's get to work.
All right.
Councilwoman, thank you very much for meeting with me.
Well, from what I hear, you've been making the rounds.
But as someone without a lot of political capital, you're certainly making an interesting choice as to how to spend it.
I have 7 dead staffers who wouldn't find it interesting at all.
And it's a terrible thing that happened here.
It's just terrible.
Police make any progress locating Edlund?
No, unfortunately.
But they're fairly confident that he targeted city hall because of our inability to enact the SCGR.
You implying I'm somehow responsible for what happened?
No.

You really have been making the rounds.
Yes, I'm against any registry that gives the government the opportunity to keep tabs on specific sectors of the population.
The DMV keeps a list of driver's licenses.
It's not a constitutional right to drive a car, Mr. Mayor.
You know, people such as yourself oppose limitations on things like abortion, freedom of speech.
Why is the second amendment somehow less important in your eyes than the other 9 in the bill of rights?
Because people are dying, councilwoman, right here in this building.
And there are limitations on abortion and freedom of speech.
Both my parents are dead.
My friend Tommy was a...
He was one of the 503 killed in the Undertaking.
Laurel Lance was my friend.
Nobody respects the rights of someone to protect themselves and the people that they care for more than me, but everything in life comes with limitations.
Everything.
Why are you telling me this?
Because you and I are gonna sit in this office until we figure out a reasonable set of limitations that respects everyone's rights.
Are you hungry?
Should I order something in?
We might be here a while.
I don't know anything, man.

I know you've seen this scumbag.
He lives in this neighborhood!
I don't know everybody, dude.
I don't!
Another dead end?
Let's just call it a long shot.
I might be taking out my frustrations on these lowlifes at this point.
Yeah.

Let's call it a night, huh?
Get you back to your not so homey home.
Seriously, John, it's fine.
Dinah, I just don't know why you don't want better for yourself.
There was one place I kind of liked.
It's a studio apartment off Canal.
It had this nice little backyard garden.
I--I went to go fill out a lease application.
I don't know.
But what?
Nothing.

It asked questions, ok?
It asked questions about the last 3 years.
Uh, jobs and--and residencies, that sort of thing.
Yeah.

Ha ha.

Yeah.
And it's not even just that.
I...
You know what?

Dinah, I work with Oliver Queen.
Please try me.
Applying for an apartment is-- it's something normal people do.
I haven't had normal in a very long time.
I don't know who I'm supposed to be anymore.
I remember I felt that way the first time I was discharged from Special Forces.
But, Dinah, I realized that
I don't have to be anybody.
I'm already me.
I just had to give myself permission to get back to that.
And how do you do that exactly?
It starts with the little things, like a small studio apartment with a garden.
Yeah.
Let's get out of here.
You got something?
Nothing but strikeouts.

Same.
Isn't Rene back yet?
No.

You want to go a couple more rounds with him?
Why don't you like us talking about this?
I just don't like you guys arguing while I'm trying to work.
Why not?

It's not healthy if it doesn't accomplish anything, and it's not going to accomplish anything.
Actually, I--I disagree not about the part of it not accomplishing anything but this idea that it's not healthy.
We used to talk about things as a society, you know?
We'd debate and we would argue, and we would still respect each other after.
Yeah.

- Rude.

It became impolitic to talk politics.
I can't help but wondering that maybe that's why our country is the way it is today.
Got something?
Maybe.
Name of a support group Edlund used to be a part of.
Maybe somebody there still knows how to get in contact with him.
Text me the address and have him meet me there.
Yeah.
I didn't care.

But Steve, he got in front of the man and...
Every time I close my eyes,
I see the gun.

It gets better, Monica.

I'm afraid we're out of time for today.
But get some coffee on the way out.
And I sprung for the good doughnuts this week.
Thank you.
Hey, man, my name's Rene Ramirez.
I work for the deputy mayor.

In his dreams!
Or, uh, I mean, yeah, kind of.
Can we ask you some questions about James Edlund?
Participation in this group is confidential.
You know what Edlund did?
I watched the mayor's press conference.
And I wish I could help, but you have to understand,
I take confidentiality seriously.
Sir, confidentiality doesn't apply when there's a possibility of future harm.
Hey, we just want to find this guy before anyone else gets hurt.
Why aren't the police doing this?
Don't worry.
We'll make sure the information gets to the right people.
I heard he was staying with a friend.
Let me see if I can get you the address.
Felicity said you wanted me here.
Was it 'cause you wanted me to hear that woman's story?
No.

Doesn't change how I feel, man.
Guns save lives, period.
You just want to think that.
No.

'Cause if I had my gun, my wife would still be alive.
Here you go.
I don't know if it's still good.
Thank you.
I didn't even know you were married.
Not something I like to talk about.
Let's call this in.
Laura, crying:

Back off.
Your bitch wife here owes me for her last high.
Rene!
Yeah.

The money's right there in the safe.
Let me hook you up.
500.
No problem.
- Mommy?

Zoe, get back in your room!
Shut up!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Sweetheart, are you ok?
Are you all right?

Mommy!
It's ok, sweetheart.

Clear.
But Edlund was here.

This is his family.
Yo, check it out.

He planned out his attacks.
Yeah.

Oh, damn!
I know what he's gonna hit next.
I am still failing to understand why a simple registry--
Ok, first of all, registries are never simple.
They're bureaucracies.
Tying up second amendment rights in red tape.
You know, and-- and it's not just the owners who'll be affected.
It's the sellers who are gonna see a substantial decline in their businesses.
Well, I don't think that it's unrea--
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Rene and Curtis found Edlund's crib and a plan to shoot up Starling General.
Assemble the team.

I'm on my way.
I have to go.
I thought we were staying till we're done.
I'm terribly sorry, but I have to go.
We're in position, northeast corner.
I'm on the southwest.
Overwatch.
No sign of the bastard, but, remember, he's good at avoiding security cameras.
Hey, don't--don't!
Don't do this.
Get back.
You had another chance to shoot me at city hall.
You didn't do it.
'Cause you need me to enact the Star City gun registry.
I mean, that's what all this is about, right?
You want to punish the city, because we failed to protect your family.
But, hey--hey!
Mr. Edlund...
I--I checked.
The man who killed your family, he acquired those guns illegally.
There's nothing that we could have done.
No--no--no registry would have helped us protect them.
I know.
I was supposed to protect them.
Isn't that a man's job to protect his family?
Isn't that why we have guns?
My wife and daughters were innocent!
I--I can understand why you're angry.
We're all angry!
We're all so angry all the time.
So why shouldn't I use this?
Why shouldn't I kill everyone, put us all out of our damn misery.
Mr. Edlund, that's not your call to make.
Yeah.

And I can understand that it feels like it's--it's getting worse every day.
But what you're doing is not the answer.
The people that you hurt, the 7 people that are dead...
My friend, they were innocent, too.
You're right.
And I deserve to be punished.
Hey, hey, hey.

I am thinking about them.
I know that you want this pain to go away.
And I know that you want to be with your family again, but if you want them to live on, it has to be through you.
That's the only way.
James...
Give me the gun.

When you ran out on me last night, you neglected to mention that it was to go help people at a hospital.
I'm forgetful that way.
The shooter in custody?
D.A. Chase says that he is going to plead guilty to everything.
Councilwoman Pollard, this is Rene Ramirez.
He works very closely with Deputy Mayor Lance.
And he's a very, very vocal proponent of gun ownership rights.
Freedom isn't free, not even the freedom to bear arms.
So Mr. Ramirez and I got together and came up with this.
What is this?
Citywide gun control ordinances.
Nothing that makes it harder to buy or own or carry a gun.
It also doesn't prohibit people from protecting themselves.
From gun violence.
Ok.

There are other reasons, too, councilwoman.
But I want to be perfectly clear about something.
Not today, not tomorrow, but eventually,
I am going to extract a political price for this.
You can count on that.
Sounds like a yes.
I can live with what you got here.
Good. 'Cause living is the whole point.
Just--just listen.
I messed up.
I know that, but Zoe already lost her mother.
"Unsafe environment"?

I'm so sorry.

I, um, ma'am, I c--I can get counseling.
I just want to see my daughter.
Please.

Ma'am?

Don't--don't--don't hang up the phone on me.
Look, ma'am, please--hello?
Hello?
Son of a bitch.
Damien Darhk, the man behind tonight's siege of Star City, was killed by the masked vigilante known as the Green Arrow.
Amateur cell phone video captured this very moment, putting an end to the chaos that has gripped the city.
Before Darhk was killed, the citizens of Star City demonstrated there is strength in numbers as they fought against their attackers alongside the Green Arrow, leading Darhk's allies to retreat.
Officials couldn't confirm the death toll...
Oh, yo, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.

I just wanted to apologize for getting in your face earlier about guns and stuff.
Hoss, do it seem like I can't handle tough talk?
No.

I--I didn't know about your wife and your daughter.
I may have done a little Googling.
I don't like to talk about it, man.
I mean...
Zoe's in a foster home, a good one, it looks like.
CPS is right.
She shouldn't be anywhere near me.
I don't agree with that, Rene.
And I have a lawyer friend who doesn't either.
How about we get your daughter back?
Hey.

You, uh, going somewhere?
A studio apartment with a garden.
You applied for the lease.
I got the lease.
Yes.
Small steps, huh?
Well, the apartment is not the only thing I applied for.
You're looking at the latest recruit into the SCPD.
Congratulations, Detective Drake.
Thank you.
Well, you did it.
I just gave you a little push.
Well, uh, I needed the push.
So thank you.
Congrats.
Thank you all for being here.
In light of, uh, what's happened,
I thought it important that we gather as a city and remember those that we've lost.
After everything that Star City has endured in the past several years, it would be easy to become immune or--or desensitized to the violence that pervades our lives.
And it would be human to want to respond to that violence with violence.
When I think of all the people that I have lost...
I remember the choices that I was forced to make in light of those tragedies.
Some choices were easy.
But the important choices, the choices that were worth making, they were hard.
And hard choices require bravery.
Fortunately, we live in the home of the brave.
And we don't run from hard choices.
We rise up, and we face tomorrow together.
Uh, this afternoon, councilwoman Pollard and I met with the city council to pass the Star City Firearms Freedom Act, a policy that respects our freedom...
And our lives.
It shows that we can do both.
And now we just have to be brave enough to do it.
