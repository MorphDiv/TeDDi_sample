This is my Jew Flattening Machine.
It'll flatten any Jew.
Simply climb behind the wheel, drive it towards a Jew, and flatten him.
Could you also use it just to drive from place to place and stuff?
It-It's a Jew Flattening Machine.
It's not what it's designed for.
But you could use it that way?

- Hey, guys.

How was marching band practice?
Peter, you know this is a pilot's uniform.
It represents years of specialized training.
Yeah, well, you know what else takes years of specialized training?

Aah!

MAN (Korean accent):

Thank you, Korean sweatshop animator.
You've earned your nickel this week.
Where're you coming from, Quagmire?
I had to fly to Aruba, so I brought my mom along with my "friends and family" discount.
Did you...
Yes, Joe, I got you a magnet.
Where do you even put all those magnets, Joe?
Well, you know I have that fridge in the garage with bags of blood in my blood type?
What's "friends and family"?
Oh, airline employees can get discounted tickets for family and close friends.
What?

If I'm being honest, I've also got a few Celeste pizzas in that fridge.
I don't know, I-I guess I just figured you guys always have to work, or you're with your kids.
But sure, yeah, I could take you somewhere.
I'm going to San Francisco next week.

San Francisco?
That city from And the Band Played On and Milk?
I'm in!
Yeah, thanks, Quagmire.
Oh, wow, this'll be great.
Hey, can you make us X-Men?
What a surprise.
Well, I'm off to San Francisco with the guys.
Okay, I'm off to Hilton Head with the girls.
- You what?

I told you about this a month ago.
I'm going with Bonnie and Donna to Donna's sister's time share.
Well, we can't both go on a trip at the same time.
I'm sorry, Peter, but I already have a taxi waiting.
(sighs) All right, I'll go tell the guys I'm not going.
Why is he taking his suitcase to tell the guys?
You guys, come on, we got to go now.

QUAGMIRE:

Son of a...
Oh, and the idiot took my suitcase.
Aw, he was taking me with him.

It's Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry.
Oh, my God, Steph, I'm such a big fan.
Thanks.

Hey, I know we just met, but can I sit on your lap during your next post-game press conference?
Sure, I don't see why not.
This is exciting for the whole Bay Area, to be just four games away from the championship...
Dad, I dooked.
That other team's not just gonna go away, though.
We've got to stay focused, keep doing what we've been doing.
Fat lady.

Yeah, I-I see her, Peter.
Make her go.
That's not how we talk to people.
Make her go.

Yay!

Wow.

I didn't realize how hilly it was gonna be.
Thanks again for taking us, Quagmire.
Hey, no problem.
Hey, you know, we're here early.
You guys want a little tour of the plane?
Yeah, that'd be great.
Normally I'd just go to Hudson News and pretend to be the most important guy there.
Can I help you?
Yes, I will have eight Dasanis and a JD Power  Associates.
(cheering, whistling)
Wow, this place is cool.
Yeah.

Like, what's this red one?
Oh, that's a voice filter, so the passengers always think the pilot is a 60-year-old Midwestern white man.
What?

Hi y'all, this is Cleveland.
AUTHORITATIVE VOICE:

We're way up in the air.
We've reached our cruising altitude of 37,000 feet.
Y'all get ready to watch Big Momma's House.
Our in-flight entertainment today will be Under the Tuscan Sun.
Ooh, I like that.
I hear it's good.
Hey, what's this button? "Autopilot"?
Oh, that allows the plane to fly itself when I need a break.
W-What do you mean, "a break"?
You don't have to fly the plane?
Of course I do.

Short break?

You don't have to touch it, Joe, you can just say you noticed it.
And what's this booth over here?
Oh, that's my back-in-time box.
I go inside, magically go back in time, and then come out and react to the fact that we're flying.
By God, we're levitating.
That's just a box full of costumes.
It's my back-in-time box!
What the hell, Quagmire?

That's not true.
I broke Gandalf in half.
It's Dumbledore!
Screw you guys.

I was a Navy pilot, you jerks.

Already filled-in crossword puzzle.
Ooh, this is food for different routes I'm not on.
All right, time to use the potty.
Don't say "potty." You're an adult.
Okay, nobody move!
Oh, my God, those guys in first class have guns.
Cleveland, just be happy with what you have.
Don't envy people.
No, Peter, we're being hijacked.
Close the cockpit door!

You move, you're dead.
So nobody try to get smart.
Mm, page 100.

Control tower, this is flight 364.
We have a hijacking in progress.

Oh, damn it, they jammed the transmission.
I'm gonna have to go to the backup communication system.
Hello?

This is Flight 364.
We're being hijacked.
I can hear you...

This is your last chance.
Open the door, or your copilot gets it.
No.

(grunts)
QUAGMIRE:

Why are you doing this?
America needs to be punished for supporting the other side of my country's civil war.
Which country?
Do you really want to know, or are you just asking because we're gonna be on a plane for a while and you think you should make small talk?
The second thing.
Open the door, or I'll start

QUAGMIRE:

Excuse me, I'd just like to ask the mom behind me who told me to stop watching Game of Thrones on my laptop if I'm still "the worst person on this plane."
You, fat guy.

Aah!

Last chance.

Don't open it, Quagmire.

QUAGMIRE:

Wait... wait, what?
That-that was quick.
I'm sorry, Peter, but I have to think about the whole plane.
There's over 150 passengers back there, several of whom are in our Commander's Club, and to them I'd like to issue a special welcome.
Oh, man, we got to help Peter!
Those crazy European guys are gonna kill him!
You know, I have a gun in the bag I checked.
If we can get to the galley, we can take the elevator down to the cargo hold.
Good idea, Joe.
Oh, man, it feels like we're in one of those hijacking movies.
You're right, it does.

Yes.

And now I can finally get into the cockpit and execute our plan:
crashing this plane into the ultimate symbol of American materialism,
Las Vegas.
You know, I've lost a ton in Vegas, but I never thought I'd lose my life there.
