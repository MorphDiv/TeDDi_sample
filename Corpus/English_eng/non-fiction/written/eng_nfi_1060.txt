Well, we... we really need you on the road.
That's the backbone of the whole operation really.
I'll be honest, Jim.
You are one of our best traveling salesmen.

Hi, Ethan.
Hi, Hannah.
I brought your dog home.
Must have been tough on you, losing your husband after all those years.
Yeah, it made me miss my daughter a lot.
And then, with the new baby coming,
I thought Rachel and Miguel could really use the help.
Yeah.
How long you get to stay for?
Uh, well, I'm...

I moved back about a month ago.

You... you never met anyone or...
Never found the right fit.
Mm-hmm.
I'm really stubborn.
I know that.
When you put your mind to something, that was that.
Yeah.
That's good for getting things done.
It's not so good for relationships.
-Uh...

Okay, well...
Okay,herewe go .

Wait,what?

I owe you an apology.
For what happened to us.
Back then.
Well, don't worry.

No.
I pushed you away.
And I was...

And I just want you to know that not a day goes by that I don't kick myself for doing that.
