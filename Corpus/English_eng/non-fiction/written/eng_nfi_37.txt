PART-TIME SPY
Non-regular worker Percentage
Test applicant 1652, JANG Young-sil, you've failed.
Next up...
Korean's National Assembly election is a week away.

Candidates from various districts are...
Test applicant 1752, JANG Young-sil...

- you've failed.

Test applicant 5287, JANG Young-sil, you've failed.
Just this.
Wait, what are you doing?

Test applicant 6253, JANG Young-sil, you've failed.
Today's phrase is, Wo xiang zhengchang gongzuo.
'I want to work properly.'
One more time.
'I want to work properly.'
I passed!
I passed when I was 35 and got a 2-year contract.
But a permanent position is within sight!
What?
The raccoon is getting off.
Enter through 8-3 car and stay on his tail.
Okay.
Wait a second, I'm sorry!
You're just going to go?
Bitch...
Excuse me!
Step aside!
Excuse me!
Can't you just return the wallet?
What?

Pickpocket!

Pickpocket!
Goddamn you!
Pickpocket!
You got a death wish?
Yo, douchebag!
Not again...
What's with her again?
You're under arrest for larceny.
Ooh, that feels good!

Dammit!
Do it harder!
Go on, stop Det.

What the hell are you?

Police office, how can I help you?
The police is killing a person!
You perverted bastard!

Take her away!
Damn it to hell!
N.S.A Intelligence
Place your eye closer.
Open your eye wider.
Don't glare, open wider.
Be confident with positive mind.
Wider please.
N.S.A Intelligence Analysis Team
I'm Blue House spokesperson LIM Jong-hoon.
In order to streamline government institutions, the President ordered re-evaluation of 50 lowest performing institutions.
According to National Statistical Office,
Department of Commerce's deficit is $200 billion,
Department of Transportation...
Me?
Yeah, you.
So 2-year contract, and 3 months left.
- Are you enjoying it?

Scouring illegal websites and doing petty jobs, it must've been dull.
Not at all.
I'll be blunt, you heard the announcement?
Not yet, sir...
Not yet?
JANG Young-si
Young-sin is on top of the list.
Young-sin is?

Because I'm 'Young-sil'.
Same thing, I'm saying, you're fired.
What?
Why am I fired?
Did I do something wrong?
No, you did well.
You'll do fine elsewhere, Ms. Young-sim.
It's 'Young-sil'...
Okay.
Good work, take care.
How did you end up with such a loss?
Still, Foreign Office is cushier.
Pardon?
$500,000?
Without an official document...
Fax?
Yes, it just came in.
Pardon?
How did you know about Deputy Director's retirement?
I've been thinking about my career too.
I know it's urgent, I'll transfer it right away.
We'll talk in detail...
Tomorrow night?

I'll pick a nice place.
See you tomorrow.
Mom.
Don't believe stuff like that.
It was an unusually weird dream!
Are you really okay?
How's work?

Of course, I'm doing well.
Good, you worked your butt off to get in.
Be courteous and always say yes to your superiors.
Yes.
Your late father's wish was to see you become a civil servant.
Yes.
I get up in the morning to brag about that.
Mom, it's not something to brag about.
Of course it is!
Anyway, take care of yourself.
Bye.
That brat...
N.S.A Management Team
I'd like to apply for unemployment pay.
I need your ID and turn in your card.
Okay.
I'm sorry, I'll be back.
The number you've dialed is not in service.
Check your number and call again.
This is the right number.
The number you've dialed is not in service...
What the...
Get me Foreign Office's Vice Minister.
This is NSA Deputy PARK,
I wanted to remind you of our meeting today.
We have a meeting today?
Pardon?
Don't joke, sir.
Did you get your problem sorted out?
What problem?
Your operating deficit,
I sent you a boost as a patriotic gesture.
Vice Minister?
I think you've been mistaken, I've never spoken to you before.
I am rather offended, I'm hanging up.
Vice Minister?

Vice Minister?
- Finance Minister?

There was a $500,000 transfer from my department.
- Could you look into the receiver?

- Yes?

We had no dealings with that account, and 1 minute after the transfer, the money was moved to China.
This is definitely a burner account.
What?
Voice phishing scammers use them to move money to China.
Voice...
- Voice phishing?

That can't be.
They knew about Deputy Director's retirement and our situation.
It is them!
That's voice phishing!
Using phone calls, and private data to fish your money.
They use private data to earn your trust...
Deputy?
Sir?
I'm in the middle of an operation!
Jesus!
Is this funny?
Fine, I got scammed!
Holy cow!
Hey!
Why are you here?
For paperwork, and came to say good bye.
You should knock.
I did.
3 times.
I see.
So... did you hear my conversation?
No, not really.
Did you get scammed?
What?

You heard wrong.
- I heard it clearly.

Go away.
Yes.
How much...
How did you?
What is wrong with you?
Is this your revenge?
Go away, I'm busy.

I can't believe this.
What!

Why are you still there?

Now!
I...
I can help you.
What the hell?
Oh!

Hey, I got an op for you, where are you?
I'm sorry, boss.

Angola?

What are you up to?
In an op?
Hello?

Buddy!
Mr. OH, it's me.
You got any agents you can spare?
Not one?
Presidential tour?
No, it's nothing.
Not a single damn agent in town when I need one.
JANG Young-sil...
- Word Processing:

- Driver License:

- Sign Language Expert

Who exactly is she?
We located a company with a large amount of calls using our own network.
What?
Ah, right.
Figuring out if this is the right company is crucial.
Right.
You can use your face to good use, so don't be nervous and act natural.
Is my face really that pretty?
Totally featureless, plain and unmemorable.
In any case, if this goes well, I'll give it a thought.
Your permanent position.
Yes, sir!
However, if you're caught, I'll act like I don't know you.
Got it?
Yes.
- Really?

- Yeah?

- You sure?

- Remember that.

Good.
You weld too?

I like your resume.
Hold my hand.
However!
If you'll feel guilty, you're better off elsewhere.
We sell hope and fear to our clients.
If you're caught, we'll go to jail.
If you report us, we'll go to jail.
But you'll be killed silently and swiftly.
I'm kidding.
I see.
And kind of not.
Half pepperoni, half Hawaiian, you know.
Right.
Passed!
Thank you!
Figuring out if this is the right company is crucial.
This way, please.
Welcome, Welcome.
Good to see you.
Server Management Office
Where do I start looking?
Excuse me?
What are you looking for?
No, well...
I'm new, I was looking for the education room.
All the offices look the same.
Is that so?
Oh.
Are you worried that something might happen?
No need to worry at all.
We use the most secured communication system, so you will not be traced.
You may not believe me, but we recently scammed NSA, and no repercussion.
Seriously?
Of course.
They transferred $500,000 as a sign of patriotism!
I think that's enough for company intro.
How about a welcome from our president?
President CHOI?
Afternoon, I'm CHOI Min-suk.
After receiving training today, you'll go into battle tomorrow.
No need to worry about your performance.
We don't criticize or cut you like the outside world.
We won't penalize you based on score.
We'll always support your dreams.
Because we're a family now.
So, end of orientation!
Thank you all.
Thank you very much.
Since it's your first day, let's introduce ourselves.
Ms. YOO Je-yun?
Good to see you, say hello everyone.
Ms. JOO Ye-ji?
Ms. JOO?

Ms. WOO Do-young?
Yes?
Ms. UHM Jung-me?
- Deputy!

Don't call me that here!
Be covert!
So what should I...
Can I call you 'baby'?
Give me the situation report.
I found it!

Yeah?
- But...

One of the employees is a cop.
Cop?

I saw her catching a pickpocket a few days ago.
Could she be undercover too?
I don't believe this...
What's her name?
I'm not sure...
Someone's coming.
I'll look into it and text you, baby.
I'm getting goosebumps.
- What the fuck are you?

I told you not to swear!
Listen carefully.
As per Criminal Law, Article 311, insulting a person is a year in prison, or $2,000 in fine.
Who's the asshole swearing beside you?
A friend?
Want to get a double fine?
Where are you?

Who the fuck did that?

Sorry about that.
I got worked up.
Ms. NA.
Swearing won't get them to fork out money.
What will the rookies learn if you always rage out?
NA JUNG-AN
You're a senior now.
Very pretty senior.
Teach and guide our new recruits.
Oh, sure.
Your station.
JANG YOUNG-SIL
Starting tomorrow, you'll learn from real life cases.
Stations have your names on it.
So please check before you leave.
What is it?
Pleasure to work with you.
Good bye.
What are you doing?
Were you followed?
Followed?
Forget it.
Is this her?
Yes, that's her.
Intellectual Crimes Unit.
They must be after the boss too.
The president?
They normally put pawns as presidents.
Pawns can't be that hot.
We have to catch the boss first, it's all over if they get him.
Why does it matter who catches first?
Shush!
If the cops get him,
"Officer, I was scammed, can I get my money back?"
Should I beg?
Oh...
I have to threaten him to get the money back!
Yes.
This is a spy cam, and a master card key.
My life is now in your hand.
You must catch him.
Infiltrate like water.
Silent like air.
When did she...
Young-sim...
JANG Young-sim!
Sir, what's your primary bank?
Don't have one.
Then where do you keep your money?
In the fridge.
You keep them in your fridge?
Because it's cold.
- Where do you reside?

- Where?

He lives in a fridge.
Am I funny?
Nope.
Shit!
Hello, this is Estic Capital.
Don't lie to me.
No, I am not lying.
We have special interest rate for our VIP clients...
Special interest rate for VIP...
You said that before.
I called you today for this offer.
Where do you work?
Let me offer you a tip, be more creative.
Something fresh, got that?
Mr. YANG:

Hello, this is Estic Capital.
You called us before concerning a loan...
Why do you live like that?
Pardon?
You're phishing, you suck blood from the people.
I think you're mistaken...
Look into the mirror, what do you see?
What you see there is trash.
Why do you live like that?
I pity your mom.
No need to feel bad, this isn't God's work.
I was angry and felt guilty too.
Now you're okay?
Can't ask for more when I get paid this much.
Do you like this work?
Sure, I get regular salary.
I'm going to make a fortune, get married, have kids, and buy a home too.
You'll feel better when you see the money.
I'm Song-yi.
Welcome.

Call in progress
Hello there.
Good afternoon.
Hello, ma'am.
It's Estic Capital.
No, not a telecom, it's capital.
Hello?

No, not a private lender, we're a capital bank.
Why is he swearing...
Please calm down, I didn't call because of that.
I think you misunderstood.
Say what?
What?
Right, I'm sorry.
If you have just 5 minutes...
You're busy because you're new to farming?
Then, next time...
Why is the cow crying?
You're vaccinating?
You must angle the needle at 45° to avoid spillage.
Right.
You did!
That's amazing!

I actually have livestock instructor license.
No need to thank me.
That's really great.
What?
You want to give us your bank account info?
Yes, input your account there.
And your password too.
Thank you, sir!
Yes.
I should be thanking you.

It could've been bad.
Always include all 5 major diseases.

I used to do some insurance work.
Are you at our new website?
Please input your password.
Then you're all set.

Learn everything from Young-sil!
She gave up beauty for money-making skills!
Applause!

Today's MVP is JANG Young-sil.
JANG Young-sil!

Let's all raise your glasses.
- Cheers!

Your call cannot be connected...
She went full retard...
What the heck?
What a big cash for a president!
Oh!
I know all about you.
I saw everything.
Handcuff goes rattle, rattle, siren goes bweep!

No?

You threw the cuffs, where's the washroom?
Ow, that hurts.
What was that...?
Young-sil, are you okay?
Is your stomach upset?
No.
I'm so fine.
How could I not be?
You're really drunk.
Thank you.
For what?
For calling my name.
Thank you so much.
For remembering my name.
Thank you.
Thanks again...
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
- Hello?

Yes?
I told you to be invisible, not be an MVP!
I didn't do that on purpose, it just happened.
Your permanent position is all but gone!
No!

I'm going to keep an eye on you!
Got it?

Yes!
My head...
Who are you?
Why aren't you answering me?
Answer me right away and don't piss me off.
My apologies.
Did you pull all data from the SIM card?
I'm not a tech support, I can't do it instantly.

- Don't be late.

Just get it done.
- Detective.

The chief wants you to get the evidence and pull out quietly.
His balls get smaller as he grows older.
But if it wasn't for him, you would've gotten the axe.
Or go to jail.
I'm holding back plenty, don't be an ass.
Certainly.
Don't starve yourself.
I'm not into thin girls.
- What did you say?

Buddy!
What a moron...
You drank quite a bit, is your head okay?
My head?
I feel fine for once.
Never mind then.
Why today... inspection...
Why...
Where are you?
I'm checking 29th floor.
Baby!
Can you call me 'deputy' when it's just us?
Yes.
There isn't much here.
And his PC is locked with a password.
It's the perfect angle.
Then I can't see you.
What?
What for?

That's not what I meant!
If you're done, get out of there!
Okay, I understand.
Who are you?
What was that?
Who are you?
You little!
Wait, wait, hey!
Hey!
NSA?
Why is NSA investigating a phishing ring?
The thing is...
Whatever, just pull out.
Goddammit...
I worked my ass off to get here.
You can't screw that up!
Goddamn!
What the hell are you doing?

We got a tail!
What?

Dammit!
I don't believe this!
Up ahead!
Watch out!
He's still behind us!
Mister!
Did you get my tea?
- Who the fuck?

I need the tea to sober up!
I've had it!
Sir, could you hold out for a bit?
Hold out for what?
Okay, let's think.
There, make a right!
Sorry, sorry!
I used to drive a cab.
You ain't too bad.
To our right!
- Do something!

I'm on it!
That hurts!
Shut up please!

Holy shit!
You dickhead!
- That was so much fun!

Dammit!
Can't even go home...
Good morning.
Intellectual Crimes Unit, Det.

Listen to me carefully.
Pull out.
Pull out.
Fuck...
- Did you swear at me?

Pull the fuck out!
Pull the fuck out!
Incompetent fucks...
Go check the monitor.
Is that because of us?
Did you see the guard?
I'm sorry...
We need to talk.
What for?
I need you to pull out.
What?
I talked sense to your superior.
Did you... beat him?
Beat who?
Shit!
She's no cop, more like a psycho.
Did she take you by surprise?
You must've been startled.
Allow me to apologize on her behalf.
I'll get to my point, pull that bitch off the op.
But that's...
You don't need to be rude.
Forget it, I want the police off this case.
Then you should file an official complaint.
What?
If you're not doing it officially, you must be up to something.
Chief GU, NSA is a superior institution.
No good will come out of this.
I don't want to pry either.
So, let's make this a joint op.
Agreed?
Are you two excluding me?
- Well...

What happened was... she wanted to know how to manage anger.
She was asking about my secret tactic...
You finally want to make some money!
Yeah, you need to be cool.
Teach me too.
Me first!
I need to know how to manage my anger.
Yes, baby?
Chief GU...
Baby...
"Baby"?
I'll keep it short, this is now a joint op.
Are you mad?

Baby?
It's either a joint op or no op.
Can't talk to her and she scares me.
I think she has anger management disability.
Baby, please!
Stop saying "baby"!
That's the final decision, just follow my order.
I haven't gone postal in a while.
Right, baby?

Dammit!
I made myself clear.
- Baby?

So it's not anger management.
You two are... discussing love life?
Right?

That's how you two became close!
Pretend to cooperate, the boss is ours
Relationship is important.
It's fishy, cooperate and keep an eye on her
Pull out voluntarily.
Can't you do it first?
I'm going to lead!
Good to see you both, could you come to my office?
Face-to-face phishing?
It's about time you tried it.
Can't I stick to telephone?
Not really.
Out you go.
Seniors don't like me.
We need to earn the trust of this organization, so go take the money.
Go on!
Sir, did you get a call from the Financial Services?
What?

Did you get a call from the Financial Services?
Yes, yes.
That's why I brought the money, but I didn't quite understand...
Your account info is exposed to bad guys.
So the government wants to protect money in your bank.
Is that so?
I could have been in trouble.
This is for my wife's surgery.
Here.
Um...
Sir, you should just leave.
What did you say?
Just walk away.
What?
Just go, head home!
What?
Get home right now, just go away!
What?
You should head home!
We'll keep it safe for you.
Call us if you need a withdrawal.
Get with the program!
But it's for his wife's surgery...
We're done if they get suspicious.
But still...
We're after the head!
But how can we let the innocent get hurt?
That's why!
That's why we need to catch him!
Excuse me, are you phishing scammers?
We're a bit busy here, could you look the other way and leave us?
Financial Supervisory?

We need a strategy to contact the head.
The poor seniors in town...
We need to gather Intel from the employees.
- That'll take forever!

I'm talking here, where are your manners!
Let's just share Intel first.
Give it back when I ask nicely.
Fine.
It's not fine!

No, I gave you the warning.
Just go the way you came from.
You could get killed!
You go, this is my town!
Dammit, I wish I could hit you!
I gotta do something!
I want to make this clear, if this op goes south, we're both dead.
Of course!
She works out...
Dang it...
Could we talk?
Over dinner perhaps?
Or a drink?
Or something hot.
Gosh, it's embarrassing.
Move a bit... more, more, more!
Shit!
Yes?
Evening, deputy.
I got something to help your case.
The burner Chinese account from before?
It resurfaced.
Is that so?
While conducting audit in prep for restructuring,
Ministry of Justice, a government branch no less!
They fell victim to voice phishing!
The deputy got disciplined to some hick town, maybe it was the director, and the deputy got fired.
- Fired?

Getting scammed is not a crime!

No one intended to get scammed!
I'm not a pushover!
Deputy?
What's up his ass?

No, no, no!
Water!

Want a rice cake?
Yup.
Go on.
So the boss travels abroad a lot.
Cheers!
So, tell me more about the boss.
I think our boss is a country manager, and the chairman...
Chairman?
Yeah, I think there is.
Probably.
Could I meet the chairman?
I heard he's in China.
Why is that your concern?
You know how are check in and out times are strict?
It's all because of security.
I heard that system is connected all over the world.
Continue, tell me more.
I heard there are call centers in China and the Philippines.
I hope to rise to his level soon.
Cheers!
Has the president worked here a long time?
Nope.
He was in the chairman's good grace.
I like your honesty.
But shouldn't you win me over first?
How?
I'm not interested in a deal that doesn't benefit me.
The chairman must be pretty cool.
I heard he's a strict person.
One false move and!
Seriously?
You're out, so out!
Where is he?
No one at the company saw him.
The president probably knows.
I heard that he's the chairman's adopted son.
Adopted son?
We're going after a whale soon.
A whale?
If you scored that, you'd be noticed.
I wonder who'll take that chance.
When did all my chest muscles migrate south?
She'll be shocked.
Jung-an, did you wait long?
Were you shocked?
Yes.
I was going to shock you with something else.
When the swelling cools down...
Take care of yourself.
I was going to shock you with my package...
Use the room!
Easy!
Shower booth is nice...
From a bar to a hotel with a man...
It's none of your business.
Don't take me for a delusional hubby.
If I don't believe my wifey, who will?
- Don't you dare!

- I came by to give you this!

The SIM card!
Oh yeah!
Something's off about the data.
What is?
Only 2 numbers were stored on there.
Where?
Deputy YANG and spicy chicken feet.
Chicken feet?
I'll do it my damn self.
Why won't this work?
Yes, one moment please.
It's in the car, so I'll send someone.
Okay.
Now?
You want it now?
Can I send it later?
You can't wait?
Okay then,
I'll come myself.
YANG and chicken feet?
You find 2 things when you search a man's phone;
his work and love life.
Do you know what this means?
He works with YANG and loves chicken?
Or the other way?
He has 2 phones, it was his secondary.
Or it could mean he's lonely.
Seriously?
Anything from the hidden cam?
No...
He poured water on it...
Anything from Mr. YANG?
He's all talk, not a damn thing.
You're not... hiding anything from me, right?
Why would I hide?
- And you?

She doesn't answer her phone.
She was never like this.
Her phone's off.
What's going on?
Maybe she really quit.
She needs money for the baby.
Can't reach her?
Go to Eun-jung's place after work today.
I'm going to try to lure the president.
Why?
- Why what?

- Huh what?

- What are you saying?

Young-sil!
Do you want a ride?
Come on.
Not hungry, and he doesn't like to drink.
Son of a bitch...
I know you got nothing to do, go to Eun-jung's place.
I got an important work.
Young-sil, are you hungry?
Hungry?
Quite a bit.
I'll treat our ace, what do you like?
Japanese?

Um...
Chicken feet.
- Seriously?

Are you alright?
Yes, I'm fine.
Looks like it's too spicy for you.
It's just right.
Your sweat.
Pardon?
Your neck.
I get sweaty when I eat spicy stuff.
So hot...
Thank you for taking me home.
Sure, good night.
Young-sil, one second!
If you get another craving, give me a call.
Yes.
Have a good weekend.
Yes.
Have a safe drive home.
Sure.
Well...
We met at the bus stop, he insisted on taking me home.
Did I ask?
Doesn't look like it was just a ride home.
Well...
How do I explain this...
I came for a chat, let's go inside.
Wait, could we go to a cafe instead?
What for?

Hold on, hold on!
My place is a dump, let's go to a cafe.
What's with you?
I'm begging you, let's go to a cafe.
You took out the house deposit and gave it to the grandpa?
It was for her surgery...
Come sit down.
It really is a dump.
Move into my place.
No way!
You can't take responsibility alone!
Let's go!
Gosh, do you ever wash your clothes?
Wear those slippers.
Hey!
Hey!

Stupid mutt!
If you shit anywhere, you're so dead!
What are you doing?
Telling him not to poop.
What a load of horse shit...
This is more like an office, than a home.
So...
Did you find anything from the president?
What?
You know...
And you?
Did you meet her at Eun-jung's place?
They said she hasn't been home.
What?
There's something I'm worried about.
About what?
The girl I was phishing told me this, she lives in a dorm with her baby.
So what?
Can't you return a third back?
Her money is paying for your kid's private kindergarten.
Even so... as a mom, I can't just let it go.
If you feel guilty, you shouldn't be doing this.
Mr. YANG...
What's with you?
Mr. YANG.
I'll never forgive those who exploit the weak.
Fuck!
I became a cop...
Anyway, I can never forgive them.
Jung-an...
I think you're a good person.
Come on, please...
There isn't much here, but consider it your home too.
We're paying for our sins half-half.
Thank you!
What's with you?

Can we be friends?
I'm not interested...
You're so frail...
I know I'm pathetic...
That's not...
Okay, fine, we can be friends...
Or not.
Really?
Thank you!
So, we're BFFs now?

Stop!
Hello?
Is this City Hall, innercity department?
That's correct.
This is District Prosecutor's office.
We've received a report about a corruption charge.
What do you mean?
Who told you that I did it?
This lady must be mad.
Is this a voice phishing?
Yes.
You're all pests who rip off money from innocent folks.
You used escort service 7 times, and visited brothels 3 times.
Does your family know?
Did you have a good time?
I think there's been a misunderstanding.
Bullshit.
From builders to contractors, you siphoned money from everyone.
Just from a few, that's hardly everyone.
If you keep this up, I'm going to report you!
Okay, you should.
When we get arrested, we'll take the list with us.
It's from the brothel, so it's quite accurate.
Ma'am, what is your name?
What for?

So what?

How much would you like?
I feel so good!
Bottom's up!
Drink, drink!
Take a selfie!
One, two, three!
BFF... until end of time...
Of course.
Ticklish!
Hey!
Why didn't you stop me?

It was your idea.
Sorry.
"BABY"
You're not even going to report back?

Keep it up and no more permanent position!
If you want the job, get me a solid lead!
Do it right, I'm not going down alone!
JANG Young-si
Attention, please!
You may've already heard, we sometimes go after big whales.
National Police, NSA,
National Intelligence, and other agencies.
JANG was a contractor for a year and was let go a month ago.
It smells fishy.
I'm taking volunteers.
That sounds juicy...
Anyone?
Good.
It's out of our league.
Anyone else?
The deeper we go, the faster we solve this.
No one?
Volunteer!
Logistics Support Base
Col. CHOI Bong-sik
Yes?
Colonel, it's Chief of Staff.
Pardon?
I'm the Army Chief of Staff!
Salute, sir!
It's about 3Q expenses,
I'm told it increased due to private contracts.
I don't understand...
That's not possible.
Sameun Precision,
GJ EC, Hando Uniform...
The costs shot up by 20-80%!
That cannot be, sir.
You son of a bitch!
The prosecution is talking about corruption charges!
You want to go to prison for this?

I'm sorry, sir.
This could be covered up from my end.
You got a star to look forward to.
Isn't that right?
If you forgive me, I'll do anything for you.
Good, we're all prone to mistakes.
Deputy, it must be a big one.
How big?
Probably over $500,000.
Listen, this is our chance.
When you receive the money, bring it to me.
With that money, it's all over, the end!
What about Jung-an?

Stop!

Look out for yourself.
Each to his own!
JANG, listen carefully.
Bring that money, and you got a job.
A permanent position.
Full-time, okay?
Yes, I understand.
Okay.
What?
Hiding something?
No.
You must have had a lot of experience as a cop.
But me...
You're a NSA agent.
You're on another level.
Well, I suppose so.
Is the Chief of Staff really mad?
We're here on an errand, sir.
He didn't have a message?
No, sir.
Just to fetch the briefcase.
Then...
Leaving already?
Stay for some tea, I got some questions too.
The Chief is waiting, sir.
Yeah?
On your way, then.
Salute.
Hold.
So...
What's the Chief's background?
Background?
Well... that's classified information...
Right?

I shouldn't have asked.
Tell him I'll visit him soon.
Got that?
Yes, sir!
Salute!
Salute.
Okay, go on.
What?
About what?
- Did you...

Are you really...
Oops, I'm sorry.
What the hell?
I'm sorry!
Hey!
Stop!
Let's talk!
Stop right there!
JANG Young-sil!
You okay?
Private 2nd Class, LEE!
JANG Young-sil!
Don't do this!
Help me up!
Common!
Young-sil!

Chief, we need to raid the HQ right away.
What?

Who the hell?
One second.
What is it?
Intellectual Crimes Unit, Det.

Undercover work must've been tough.
Where's the NSA agent?
It's really hot today.
Make her feel every hit.
Hit it.
You bastard!
Let go!
Det.

Let go of me, you fucks!
Too bad she's a cop.
Hey, boss?
I'm mission complete.
I'll go back.

Okay, off you go.
I'll buy you a round before your next op.
Yap.

Damn smart dude.
Oops.
Come, sit.
Dang it.
The filter's messed up.
This isn't fair.
What about my job?
Don't be so naive.
Did you really believe that?
It's gotta be a permanent position.
You know what I've been through!
Deputy!

I'll do whatever it takes!
Just one more chance!
I'm begging you!
Ms. JANG.
This is the real world.
Once a temp, forever a temp.
So you never intended to hire me?
Isn't that obvious?
How can I trust you?
You used me for this...
You're going to regret this.
Step aside.
Sorry, Young-sil.
Det.

Det.

What in the world?
Can't reach NA, what's going on?
Do you think something happened to her?
Chief, don't even say it!
You prick.
What happened to that NSA agent?
She's unreachable either.
I'll look into NSA.
Well, well!
It's over!

Seeing you, makes me happy!
Let's take a look at you!
So you never intended to hire me?
Isn't that obvious?
How can I trust you?
Phone...
Young-sil...
The phone is currently off...
Come on!
Answer me!
Young-sin, why are you doing this to me?
JANG Young-sil!
Ms. Jang.
Where's Jung-an?
Is she okay?
I was pondering what I should do to her.
What should I do?
Lose some weight!
You'll have lighter steps if you lose some.
Right?

Right.
What?
Got a problem?
Is that it?
Want to go?
I'll beat your ass.
You're all dead.
Yes, she's well.
She's flapping around like a fish out of water.
Let me go!
Would you like to hear her voice?
Hello?

I'm sorry, I really am.
It's all my fault, I'll be there to...
Shut the hell up!
You backstabbed me!
Anyhow, if you come here, I'll kill you myself.
Got it?

Okay, I'll be there soon, please wait.
Please, don't come!
I'm telling you, don't come here!
That'd be no fun.
Jung-an?

Young-sil, time's running out, please hurry.
...drowned bodies are found in the river, the police are looking to ID the bodies.
The bodies have been in the water for 2 to 4 days...
Jesus...
There you go.
Jung-an!
I told you not to come.
But we're friends.
I'm sorry.
Crazy bitch...
Bitches...
You're all dead.
Chief, he's heading for the harbor.
Maybe they're smuggling out of the country.
Yeah?

Let's move!
You promised.
You believed him?
I didn't make any promises.
And you're the one who deceived us.
You pretended to be kind and weak, then took off with the money alone.
No work ethics.
Damn you...
The boat is coming in, Mr. Chairman.
What?
You're the chairman?
What exactly are you?
You bastard, I should've killed you.
You piece of shit!
I don't believe this!
Come here!
My apologies, I'll head out first.
Where you going?

Young-sil, you know something?
Nonstop kindness is being stupid.
Perverted bastard.
I agree with him though.
Unleash them.
- Too bad.

Let's go over there, get up.
Why?
Joint op!
One...
Two!
Let's go.
One, two.
One, two.
Bastards!
One, two.
One, two, one, two...
Eh?
I was an assistant to a magician.
What the hell were we doing?
Hey, mutt, go home if you want to live.
Don't go any closer!
Stop!

That dog won't let go once it bites.
That's why it's dangerous!
Give me a second.
It's right on time.
Young-sil...
Hey, hey!
Animals or people, all males are the same.
I actually have an animal whispering certificate.
Jung-an, you okay?
Come on!
What is it?
That bitch!
Get her!
He fired at me?
Get the boat back.
Damn it!
Freeze!
JANG Young-sil!
You have to go, sir.
Dang it!
Hey!

Son of a bitch!
Split up and find them!
Yes, sir!
On the double!
Police!
Freeze!
Finish him, alright?
Can't he warn us before shooting?
Kill him!
I'm so friggin' tired.
Bring the car around.
Yes, sir!
- Take care of this.

Yes, sir!
Should I go too?
Mr. YANG!
Fuck, what now?

My money!
It's... my money, goddammit!
Why's he shooting at everything!
Act like a chairman!

My money, my money...
Isn't it my time to shock you?
Ruptured...
Moron...
Come on!

Get me out at once!
Let go of me, you pricks!
What's going on?

Are you cops?

- Let's talk at the station!

CHOI Min-suk!

Step on it.
Young-sil.
You have a knack for surprising people.
You should give yourself up.
You may be able to mitigate this.
Want to hear a funny story?
A drunken driver's Ferrari smashed into a pickup truck.
The truck driver died on the spot, and perp was set free because he was son of a rich prick.
Despite having 3 witnesses, they all lied under oath.
No more witnesses, and misplaced evidence,
so my innocent father... became the perpetrator.
Stay back!
Stay back, please.
Don't come any closer!
You took away jobs from innocent people.
This job was life to Song-yi.
But I...
That way!
CHOI Min-suk!
It's all over!

Son of a bitch!
Don't just stand around, could you be a darling and get me a car?
You!
Shut your damn hole!
Jung-an, please.
Calm down!
You should learn to manage your anger.
If you harm her in any way,
I'll kill you myself!
That's not what's important right now!
What's the big deal with her?

She's nothing!
- What?

Jung-an!
Det.

No!
Why are you all pissing me off?

Are you brushing me off because I'm a temp?

- Get them in the car!

Don't be a crybaby.
Let's go!
To the ER... please...
What'll you do now?
I'm not sure.
Just for today, I don't want to think.
What else are you good at?
You're like an onion with so many layers.
That's nothing at all.
Sorry.
'Sorry' is a habit, you're not sorry at all.
Not at all, I really am sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry!

I'm serious.
How's the tattoo?

Of course.
And yours?
- Of course!

How about a greeting?
Lock eyes with them and try to talk.
How To Talk to Dogs
Let's try once more.
That's the end of class today.
Prep for a test tomorrow.
Great work today!
