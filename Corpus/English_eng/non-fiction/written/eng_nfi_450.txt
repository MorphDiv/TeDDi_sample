Crime fighting gets an upgrade on APB.
- So, are you impressed?

Catch all-new episodes Mondays.

Bones, Sleepy Hollow and 24:

- Why does it need to be you?

Only on FOX.
For 20 years, Reeves industries has been at the forefront of the high-tech revolution.
In fields as diverse as civilian space flight, computer design, robotics, and materials science,
Reeves industries has taken the lead, identifying the world's most challenging engineering problems and solving them.
Founded in 1989 by Gideon Reeves when he was only 20 years old, the company has grown into the largest gl...
I think we can stop there.
You guys get the idea, right?
$120 billion company, I'm a genius, et cetera.
All stuff that you know.

Oh, gosh, I love that.
All right, so...
Why did I drag a couple dozen oil company executives to the middle of nowhere?

No.
It's because you have a problem.
Oil... well... fires.
Just one of those bad boys costs millions... and it's not just about the money, either.
It's about putting your employees in danger.
Like this.
Stay calm... it's all part of the presentation.
Ah, now, when there is a fire, what do you do about it?
You send your guys in, somehow get dynamite close to the thousand-degree flame, detonate it, cross your fingers that the shock wave will snuff out the blaze.
It's expensive, it's dirty, it's ineffective.
We can do better.
Introducing...
The Reeves tk421.
All right, you've seen drones.
Folks...
This is not just a drone.
Stays airborne for 36 hours.
Operates at temperatures up to 1,700 degrees.
It also carries an exclusive Reeves industries concussive charge.
Which means, if you have an oil fire, you can do this.
Look at that.
Look, look.
Still flying.
Still flying.
ADA here is my CTO.
She'll answer any technical questions and take orders.
Thanks very much, guys.

That's you, that's you.
You missed it.
Okay, it'll come around again.
We getting orders?
Yeah, Gid, we're getting orders.
KRT petroleum is in for $65 million.
Good.
And Altaco is in for 80.
80?
Still talking to the others.
Well, you seem thrilled.
Hmm.
You're pissed at me.
Hmm.
What you pulled back there?
You said that you were gonna put on a small display.
You didn't say anything about starting world war III.
Oh, my god, you got to...
You got to surprise 'em, you got to show 'em, not just talk at them.
You know what else we're getting besides orders?

From lawyers who are pissed because we scared the hell out of their clients.
You're not pissed 'cause of a few lawyers.
What is it?

It's the same thing every time.

I'm sorry for inventing an amazing drone.
Next time I'll do something really boring for you, all right?
Hmm.
Adam, could we pull off up here, please?
Hmm?
Well, I...

What, in this area?
Also, you quit.
I'm punishing myself.

Right.
Ah...
Hey.

Uh...
Pack of reds, please.

Quickly over to the right, dribbling up to the side corner, where...
Keep the change.
And the pack.
Uh, lighters.
Over there.

The money.
Now!
I said now!
The safe.
I-i can't open the safe.
Don't play games, man.

No games.
911.

Hold?
There's an armed robbery.
The operator will be with you shortly.
What are you doing?
Huh?

911?

Hey!

Don't move!
Whoa, stay there.
Whoa, listen, listen...
Don't move, man!
Wait.
It's, like, a grand.
Just...
Just go.
You got to be worth a lot more than that, man.
Whoa!

Okay.
Oh.

Hold on, hold on, hold on.
911.

Sir?
I need you to tell me what is going...
Uh, yeah.
I need help.

Where the hell are you people?
Is there anything else you remember?
Maybe something you mentioned to the 911 dispatch...
Yeah, she put me on hold.
Right.

Uh, I'll be honest, Mr. Reeves.
I'm sorry, but there's not much we can do with this.
What about surveillance cameras?

Fingerprints?
Don't you have a team that you can, like...
Forensics?

You got to go uptown for that.
Look...

There wasn't much.

How the hell am I supposed to pick him up without a warrant?
I think that wraps us up.

I faxed it over!

Just got to make some copies.
Hames transferred out this morning.
Guess you're running solo now, kid.
Hey.
You all right there?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You know, that was my beat.
That area around the liquor store.
I heard what happened.
Well...
Looks like the investigation's off to a great start.
Karnes got downsized in the budget cuts.
He's gone by the 15th.
Oh, that explains things.
Somehow I sensed I wasn't getting his a game.
Yeah, when you play with no equipment and no one in the stands, you tend to lose your a game pretty quick.
It's, uh, it's no excuse.
I'm sorry about your friend.
And we anticipate building 500 more units by fall of 2018.
Thank you.
The executive committee will take a look and discuss it at the next full council meeting.

Thank you, mayor.

Mr. Gideon Reeves of Reeves industries.
He'll be making a presentation for us.
Welcome, Mr. Reeves.

Mr. Mayor.

You want to personally extend your deepest condolences.
Oh, boy, I've heard that speech so many times,
I know it by heart.
Here's what I haven't heard is...
A real plan that might lead to an arrest.
My friend was killed a month and a half ago, and since then, the 13th district has been too busy laying off cops to even mount an investigation.
They have no suspects, they have no leads, they have no manpower to find any.

Oh, I've been down those avenues.
Expressways, even.
Know where they all lead?
Straight into the bureaucratic black hole that is your office, Mr. Mayor.
I'm sorry you didn't get the response that you were looking for.

I want justice for Elliot James Sully.
Who taught me how to ride a skateboard when I was nine.
And helped me break in to the MIT physics lab when I was 16.
And who gave his life for mine six weeks ago.
Mr. Reeves...
I understand that you're upset, but it was my understanding that you were coming before us with a proposal of some kind.

I do.

Give me the 13th district to run.
Excuse me?
This city has a budget problem.
You have an $89 million unfunded pension obligation for the city's police department, and I have a checkbook right here.
Other pocket.

I will personally fill that budget hole out of my own bank account, and I will upgrade the 13th district to the best technology money can buy...
Or I can build, 'cause, you know, let's be honest, that's the good stuff.
Mr. Reeves, a civilian cannot take over a police district.

Um, here's the rest of my proposal.
You turn me down, and I will finance all of your opponents in the next election.
And you can explain to the taxpayers why you turned down almost $100 million in free money.
And then when you lose,
I will present the same thing to the next mayor.
Same checkbook.
Different checks.
Well.
Proposals take time.
Of course.
Of course.

I have some reporters outside.

I, I don't want to be rude.
We've all seen revolutions in a lot of industries.
Computers, telecom.

Mr. Reeves, what about other districts?
This is a pilot program, right?
I spent $2 billion on rockets to start Reeves aerospace.
Most of them blew up, but eventually, we got a bird in orbit and now that's the design that everybody copies.
So it's the same thing.

You succeed in one district and, uh, the rest will follow.
Mr. Reeves, you've been accused of grandstanding.

What do you say to people who say this is just a publicity stunt?
My best friend bled to death in my arms, and I want to find the man that made that happen.
You can call that a publicity stunt if you want.
I call it justice.
You like that line?

No.

adios, mijo.
Bye, mita.
Come on, papi.
I put some raisins in there for your snack, all right?

And your cheese and crackers are for your lunch.

And don't let your dad forget to give you your jacket this time.
Oh.
You mean this jacket.
Hey, buddy.
Mwah.

Okay.
Thanks.
So... today's the day, huh?
Arma-Gideon.

From what I'm hearing at city hall, the mayor basically said he'd facilitate transfers out of there.
I've spent the last decade working the same beat, okay?
I'm not going anywhere.
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about.
You're still riding around without a partner and you got a guy coming in who doesn't know the first thing about police work.

Just trust me, okay?
I'm good.
This will blow over.
These reformers come in and out of the south side all the time.
I bet we'll never even see him.
All right.
Drop him back off Sunday.
Thank you.
Have a good day at school.
Okay.

Don't start, mom.
Mami...
Three tours in Iraq, I've never seen this much crap in one place.
Sarge, what is all this?
I mean, what's...

Don't ask me.
They were here all weekend setting it all up.
What the hell are you doing with my printer?
It was garbage before I was born, man.
Yeah, well, I know how to use it.
I'm sorry.
Got a new coffee machine, too.
Thing cost more than my house.
Listen, up!
You can stare at everything later.
Roll call, two minutes.
All right, I know we all saw the changes in the station.
I'm just asking everyone to keep an open mind here.
All right?
Mr. Reeves.
Who here hates me?
Come on, you saw the piece in the post.
"Chicago deserves better
"than an arrogant, dilettante
"billionaire playing games with their safety."
Well...
I am arrogant.
I am a billionaire.
Dilettante?
Yes.

I'm one other thing that they didn't mention.
I'm an engineer.
And, folks, we have got an engineering problem here.
Let's do the math.
13,289 cops in Chicago;
2,869,121 people...
Which means each of you protects and serves 215.9 people.
That's an impossible task.
I'm here to make it possible.
With this.
The APB app allows citizens to call in real time GPS-located crime reports from anywhere in the district.

They just became your partners.
All right.
Now for the good stuff.
ADA.
Silicon carbide disc body armor.
It can stop any projectile traveling at 30 kilometers per second.
That's 50 times faster than the average bullet.
And if the bad guys keep coming, we've upgraded your side arms to this.
The next generation in taser.
The bad guys get toy guns, too?
Actually not a toy, not a toy.
I took the liberty of giving my assistant Jeff a knife.
Jeff, could you stab me in the face please?
Fine, it's all right.
Don't worry, he's fine.
Now you might be wondering, what about a gun at long range?
Okay, all right.
He's okay.
I pay that guy a lot of money.
This is just the beginning.
I show you some of the things I got, boom...
Your heads will explode;

We don't have enough paper towels for that.
Let's just, let's get to questions.
Yeah, I got one.
Why is some rich guy able to buy justice?
Is crime only an issue when it touches you?
Cause we get, what?
Ten unsolved murders a month?
Where are their billionaires?
Ouch.

Um, tough question.
Maybe a little mean, but fair.
Let me just make something clear here.
Do I want the man who killed Sully caught?
Yeah, I do.
But this is much bigger than that.
This is about everybody who gets hurt when cops don't get the resources to do the job.
You guys are my partners in a new era of police...
Barry, you're messing up my speech, man.
All right, long story short...
We're gonna change the world.

That's the safety.
Turn it on here.
Oh, yes.

Hey, Murph-Murphy, right?
Uh... yeah.
Yeah.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Do you remember me?
Yeah, I remember.
I want your help with Sully's case.
Were you not listening in there?
Yeah, yeah.
You know, when you're a guy like me, people tell you what you want to hear and I need someone who won't.
Okay, but I'm not a detective.
I've read your file.
You've got all the qualifications for detective and then some, so...
Look, I really appreciate what you're trying to do here...
All this technology...
But it doesn't solve cases;

You haven't met my technology.
Just try it out.
And you know, if I'm wrong, then I will leave you alone.
But if you like it, you'll help me out.
Deal?
Deal.

You must be kidding me.
Okay.
Meet your new cruisers.
Each of these links back to dispatch and the APB app that Gideon showed you earlier.
We can monitor you from the control center at all times.
Now the chassis is armored with a proprietary Reeves industries ultra-hard alloy.
It can handle anything under a 50 Cal.
Yeah.

Wow.
Whoa.

Y'all good?
Okay.
And we're live.
You nervous?
Nope.
Liar.
- Yeah, look, whatever.

Yeah, well, it's better than me having to talk to you all the time.
Four blocks away.
That's us.
Hey, 1305, show us responding to a possible assault in progress.
Copy that, 1305.
I got that when you pressed the button.
Right.
Where is he?

APB.

That was just, like, 30 seconds ago.
Yeah, so where is he now?
I don't know.
Oh.
What's your name?
Marshawn.

You just wanted to see if the app worked?
Are you guys real cops?
Oh, this is great.
I'm gonna go shoot myself with my fake gun.
What?

People want to see if it works.
Theft report.
What?

Who's, who's car 1309?
It's Murphy.
Okay, good.
Car 1309 responding.
Whoa.
Suspect identified.
In pursuit.
Stay on the ground.
Stay on the ground!
You feel that?

That's the ground.
Squad 1309, be advised, suspect is in custody.
Great job.
So, are you impressed with my technology?
Do we have a deal?
Maybe.
I mean, there's clearly an upside to it.
You just need to be more open.
Okay.

Murphy got a good collar yesterday.
Good for her.
I don't know, Brandt.
I mean, that app thing helped Murphy book a smash-and-grab yesterday.
I mean, when was the last time we did more than hang paper on it?
That was one arrest.
In the meantime, we got three negative contacts and two homeless guys fighting over a shopping cart.
What, what?

I mean, hell, I get calls on those same homeless dudes all the time.
You see that?
You see that right there?

Same area, same call.
Probably the same kid.
You think this is funny?
You wasting our time?

You think this is a game?
Give me the phone.

I said stand down.
I told you to stop playing around!
Who's in there?
My dad.
I ain't that guy, right?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Police, hey!
Stay down.
You are under arrest.

How is this investigation of yours supposed to work if I'm on patrol duty?
I talked to the captain.
He's getting your shifts covered.
You're on this until we catch Sully's killer or till I go bankrupt.
To be honest, I looked at Sully's case, and it's running really thin.
Well, yeah.
That was the old file, right?
I've been working on a new one.
You realize I spent, like, $100 million getting this police station, right?
Did you think I was just gonna poke around in your file cabinets?
All right, here is what we know.
A white male, five ten to six foot, mask, drives a white mid-'90s car.
Yeah, there's a lot of those.
Uh-huh.

So, here are liquor store robberies with a bad guy fitting that description.
That's better, right?
Still too much noise.
Not enough signal.
Then, I read a study that says criminals tend to favor the same color and make of getaway car.
You know, you could have saved yourself a lot of time reading if you just would've asked anybody in here.
So you factor that in and we have...
Right there.
Now, I figure he's probably stealing cars, you know, near his home, right?
Well, he's not taking a bus to Evanston to steal a getaway car.
Exactly right.
So you pull up cars stolen within a day of the robberies and you get that.
Not bad.
And this is the good part.
We monitor the area with drones and when we identify the possible cars...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, you don't get it.

Just leave your robots.

That area you found, cops have been working that beat for 20 years, gathering any information they thought would be useful.
Gang intel, jail time, you name it.
Okay, so we're searching for guys in the area with links to known car thieves or records of car theft.
Definitely not him.
Not those two.

I know these people.
Ramon here...

He wouldn't pick a dime off a sidewalk.
And Skeeter, well, Skeeter stole a car and drove it off a bridge.
I'm sorry, that-that's not funny.
It's not those two.
These are our suspects.
Okay, we've got last known address and phone, the suspects in Sully's murder.
Okay, good.
Okay, everyone, we're sending you information on a list of suspects now.
Just remember, you're looking for a killer.
Be careful.
Yeah, 1305, show us responding at 1325 Camden.
I'm on it.
Heading to 335 Blackburn.
So, how much faith do you have in billionaire boy's computers?
You know he can hear you right now, right?
I'm just saying.
We're gonna be knocking on doors all day.
We're not gonna find any killer car thieves.
You got any intel on this guy?
Name is Randal Hatcher.
Priors for assault and attempted murder.
Well, sounds like a bad guy, doesn't mean he killed Gideon's buddy.
Hey, hold it.

Hey, rookie.

We're just knocking on the door.
Mr. Hatcher?
Police, open up.
Police, open up!
What was that?
Suspect is fleeing.
Suspect is fleeing.
We're in pursuit!
Damn it!
We lost him.
What the hell was that?
Gideon, was that you?
Yeah, that's me.
Had it in the air.
He's heading south toward Ellis.
Had what in the air?
Who cares?

All right, he just entered a brick building at the corner of 78th and Ellis.
Copy.
Reyes, wait!
He's headed upstairs.
Hatcher!
Come on, don't make this worse than what it is.
There, the window.
He's upstairs, east side.
Hatcher, give it up, man!
Reyes!

Go, go, go.

We need an ambulance right now!
We have an officer down!

Come on, buddy, I'm here with you, all right?
Gideon, do something!
Come on, buddy, just stay with me, okay?

Stay with me!

All right.
Hey, you wanted to see me?
We've got a situation on our hands.
Folks around here are upset that a rookie cop went into a building on your boss's say-so and got shot.
We've had requests for transfers, and, oh, yeah.
Found these.
Just thought you should know.
Great.
Aah!

Oh, god!
Oh, hi.

So, some of the cops in the district...
Want me gone?
Yeah, I got that when, um, someone returned their taser gun through the windshield of the rolls.
What are you doing?
I am modifying the drone.
Um, gave it a floodlight, 20,000 lumens.
And a loudspeaker.
And now, I'm trying to add a taser projectile unit.
Gideon, you should go home.
Oh, my... go home?
Okay, ADA, Reyes should not have even been in that building, right?
If we were able to actually use this drone, he would be home with his family right now.
Yeah, but you realize that none of this is gonna...
Please don't say,
"none of this is gonna bring back Sully." Come on, you-you have a, you have a PHD from Cal Tech.
You're better than that.
Okay, man, I get it.
You're upset.
But the fact is Sully is gone.
And you are gonna get bored of playing cops, just like you got bored of aerospace, and you got bored of nanotech, and you...

We need to ask you to come with us.
Oh, the silent and intimidating thing makes for a fun drive.
What are we doing here?
Mr. Mayor.
You didn't return my call.
Well, I've been a little busy.
I heard you had some trouble earlier.
And you thought you'd, uh, violate my civil rights to celebrate?
Your carelessness and arrogance got a police officer shot.
So you brought me out here to say that, why, exactly?
Are we gonna go for a swim after?
Or is it the view?
Walk away.
Make a statement about the challenges of police work, and express your support for my administration.
Maybe you should just skip to what happens if I do none of that.
I will come at you with everything that I've got.
You've got one police district.
I have 21.
Do the math, genius.
Hey.
Hi there.
You slept here?
Ah, I was working on something.
Figured I'd... try to...
I don't know...

Look, I, um...
I know a lot of people here blame you for what happened...
I believe you mean the entire police force blames me.
Do you even know who the "police force" is, Gideon?
I mean, they're a bunch of scared, screwed-up people who come to work every morning wondering if today's the day that they get shot.
We're not some engineering problem you can just fix.
Look, Reyes?
He was fired up.
I tried to call him back, but... he was careless.
The mayor dragged me out for a romantic meeting last night.
He wants to shut me down.
Well, you're not shut down yet.
And look, the only shot that we have at catching this bastard is the APB app.
We tried...

Look, when we are after a drug dealer, we don't talk to regular citizens.
We work our contacts.
You want information on criminals, you need other criminals using the app.
They're the ones that know what's going on.
We got to get out there, tell them we need help finding the guy that killed Elliot Sully and shot Reyes.
And when we catch him, we're gonna remember who had our backs and who didn't.
That's how it works at Chicago pd.
Your computers are great, Gideon, but you've got to let the cops do their job first.
I ran a regression analysis on the Hatcher sightings over the last six hours, and as you can see, we have been getting stuff, but a lot of it is just garbage, people seeing shadows.
We could up our patrol.
I'm not sure we have the manpower.
Hang on.
Hang on!
Uh... can I borrow this?
So...
Pull everything that fits in a random distribution, 'cause garbage would be evenly distributed, right?
But-but, like, real sightings would come in tighter clusters.
Okay, this is four hours ago.
Where?

Three...
Yep.
Now, two.
Then half an hour ago.
All right!
So...
So-so he's moving.
We can work with that.
What did you just do, girl?
It's just a filtering algorithm.
What's it say?
Men shouting.

That's... okay, location?
Hang on.

It's northeast, across the river.
Wow.
Okay, a call just came through from an apartment building on east 75th and Cramler.
Men arguing, shots fired.
Is it Hatcher?
I mean, I can't be sure, but based on his past location and movements, it's a high probability.
It's good enough for me.
75th and Cramler.
There.
Hey, do we have a floor, or...?
No just an address.
I told you to get...
Hey, boost the audio.
Okay.
No, please!
I don't have the money!
I said, don't lie to me!
I know you got money last week from the drug job with Rico.
Hatcher, man, I told you!

I gave you all I had!
No, man, please, man.

Sims, do it.

No!

Please, no...
What the hell is that thing?

Police!
Drop your weapons!
Oh, it's the cops, hatch!
We got to roll!
Put your hands in the air.
On the third floor?
Watch out!
Ugh!
Where the hell are you going?

I'm getting out of here!
Come on!
Police!

I said, drop your weapon!
Agh!
I got him...

Got it.
Suspect has entered a residence.
I'm in pursuit.
You go.

Guys, are you seeing this?
Yeah.

Keep that drone clear, they'll hear you.
You got eyes on Hatcher?
Yeah, him and about 20 hermanos Latinos and all their friends.
Fantastic.
Half the crowd is gonna be strapped.
If this goes bad, he won't even need to shoot us.
Well, then it's got to go good.

If we lose him, we won't get another shot.
I'll go around back.
Smoke him out.
Murphy, get ready.
Copy.
Police!

Police!

Get out of the way!
Move!

Everybody move!
Slow your roll, officer!
Wait, can you get the drone closer?
No, I can't get too close or he'll kill her.
Drop your weapon!

I'm gonna count to three, and you're gonna get out of the way so me and my new friend here can leave.
One...
Two...
Okay.
Okay, fine.

Good.
Smart girl.
Good.
Come on.
The taser won't kill her, but he will.
Oh, my god!
Smarter than you, you son of a bitch.
Hey, hey.
It's okay, you okay?
Breathe.

Okay?

Hey.
Nice work.
You too, boss.
Where Maverick billionaire Gideon Reeves and his new 13th district have succeeded in capturing the lead suspect in the murder of Reeves industries' CFO Elliot Sully.
Though some have criticized the imposition of what has been called "Gideon's law,"
this success boosts his credibility...
Hey.
Hey.
Is that why you called me?
Heard you were looking for me.
Yes, uh...

Oh, and, detective, try to keep overtime under $50 million.
Um, so what about you?
What now?
Me?

Figuring it out.
As I'm sure you're aware... my experience playing cop wasn't entirely successful.
Do you think it's any different for the rest of us?
Look, I think that you really have a lot that you can offer here.
Hey, Gideon!
You need to come with me.
Uh, can it wait?
I'm having a whole moment here.
No, it can't.
Okay...
So since the takedown of Hatcher hit the news last night, we have had a spike in the downloads of the APB app, and we've had a bunch of incident reports coming in.
Right.

No, Gideon, you don't understand.
Okay?

I'm talking about the whole city.
Oh, boy.
You've seen the future of crime fighting on APB.
Here are a few more shows to check out from FOX.
Do you two have any idea what this number is?
