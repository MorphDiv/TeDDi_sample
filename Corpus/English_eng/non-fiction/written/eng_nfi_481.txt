What are you planning to do, Baby Cherian?
Everyone has families and difficulties.
Baby!
Hey Baby!
You son hasjumped from the top of Thonekkunnu hill again!
Come fast!
- lmagine that the policy holder is dead.
- lt's not like llc.
- lf you pay one premium, you'll be covered for your whole life!
The company will pay back your money with interest!
Eldo, start the car!
Stop your bloody song!
It's the latest song!
- His first jump was 2 years back, Doctor.
Jesus Christ!
Clara!
Clara!
Hey!
His second jump was during the first Holy Communion of our Sub-Engineer Xavier Sir's sister's eldest son.
(Church choir singing)
Oh God!
He jumped again!
Put him inside!
Stop your damn song!
is everything in place?
Since Christ was there to save him in the form of a lorry carrying rubber sheets, he didn't die!
Only this much happened!
Christ?
In the form of a lorry?
One,
Two,
Three..
Four,
Sir, I can't find the neutral wire of this thing!
Working in KSEB, and you don't know which is the neutral wire!
Hold that black wire!
Oh my God!
That's phase, and the one next to it is neutral.
Sir, what are we gonna do about Mathachan's connection?
He's going on calling!
When I asked him to get me 2 bottles, he told me that he doesn't want a connection by giving alcohol  water!
He doesn't know that current is generated from water!
Mathachan will be in deep water!
That was one hell of a jump, doctor!
Look Papa, it's Aby!
Aby!
Son!
Hey, don't jump!
Stop there!
Sonny!
Hey!
Oh my God!
Looks like he has all the water of Idukki dam inside him!
Papa!
Instead of Mathachan, it's Sir who was in deep water!
There goes Xavier Sir's liver!
Get lost!
And that he cannot speak?
Well..
In spite of being stuck in front of the fireworks at the Church festival,
That's when we had a doubt.
And Dr. Sukumaran from our neighbourhood also said that it will be quite difficult to get him to speak.
He will speak.
He can hear as well.
But he has to feel that he wants to do it.
The vision  thought process of such kids are different.
They won't be seeing many things in the same way as we do.
They are the ones who dream even when they are awake!
Aby Baby.
He's a special baby.
A special one!
Friends, the fireworks spectacle we were all waiting for, is about to begin.

This madness is age-old.
Socrates, Einstein,
Archimedes, and our Gandhi.
Each one of them had a madness which toppled this world.
An intellectual madness.
At the pinnacle of this madness, in 1912, this man called Fran ois Reichelt, jumped from the top of Eiffel Tower, while the police  the army stood watching.
And did he fly?
Sparks flew out of his eyes!
So many others after that.
How many ever times you throw stones to get the mango from its tree, only that one throw that brought the mango down would be remembered!
People will talk only about that!
Who threw stones at the mango tree here?
Baby, your son;
He will fly!
How much did you spend this time, Baby?
Good that there were no fractures this time.
Jeena Chechi, keep this there.
What did Father Thondel say?
He said that he will write a letter to a new special school at Painavu.
Since there will be other kids like him, he might make friends easily!
Here you go!
Give it to them.
Get him admitted to some such school.
Or else, the whole town will be in deep water.
I think the frog is still inside my stomach.
Should I swallow a snake to kill it?
Let me know if you need any other help.
Anu!
Come!
- l have to go to her house.
- Ya. I'll be here for 2 months.
- Okay then.

To fly high in these skies'
'Wake up'

'Shine brighter, rise higher, grow taller'
'With fresh, flying colours tomorrow'
He doesn't have any such problems like you've imagined.
I just hope he starts talking.
Everything will be all right.
Right?
You're smart!
'Share all the woes of your soul with me, my love'
'Come, flying along, with your new wings'
'Come before my eyes, as the first rays of the morning sun, after a good night's sleep'
What's the point of taking medicines in vain?
You shouldn't keep working!
Son, you should make your mother understand.
- Next is Haseena.
'Time will pass as days and nights'
'You will rise up to the sky'
'Come, come along with me, with your fresh new sprouts'
'Come before my eyes, as the first rays of the morning sun, after a good night's sleep'

It's a Hindi film, Father.
Father!
He's talking about some insurance policy.
Whatever it is, ask him directly.
Isn't this like Mangium Money-Chain?
I lost a lot of money on Mangium.
I don't want to lose more money, Father.
We just need the copies of your certificates.
Please sign here.
We'll do the rest.
Here?
It's not because I need this.
This is for the kid.
I also have a little one at home.
Okay.
You don't have to bother about anything else.
If sentiments work, use it!
Hereafter, take your son along, when you go for field work.
You should cover yourtarget, right?
You are doing this job for him as well, right?
One double omelette!
- One double omelette over there!
Did you wear your slippers, son?
Come!
Sit properly.

I have good policies for people staying in the middle east.
Brother!
That ladder is damaged!
Who knows when something would happen?
If you don't get a policy, phew!
Once I come down, you won't have the time for it.
Move your hand.
I was just an accountant at a utensil shop.
And today, I am this company's inspector!
Under me,
Hey!
Listen to me.
There are 760 agents working under me.
You know how much my commission is?
65,000.
How much?
65,000!
I just have to sit at home!
The cheques keep coming!
230.
Jayan Chetta, are you leaving?
I was just leaving.
I'll finish this now.
This is the scheme I told you about.

Long live the working class!
'At Mariyapuram Panchayat, there's not even a drop of water'
Long back, everyone used to fly!
Humans, trees, cats, dogs, and everyone else!
And gradually, everyone stopped standing on the ground!
Then God asked everyone to come down.
Audacious creatures!
None of them listened to God.
Would God leave them alone?
He chopped all their wings off!
But can His tricks work against humans?
Instead of those chopped wings, humans invented an airplane!
Fly it!
Clara!
Chechi, I was wondering what happened to Aby when I didn't see him in the bus for few days.
But how will you send him when you're unwell?
He's taking that ailing child to toddy shops, street vendors  brandy shops, to make people take insurance policies from him.
Such a bad thing to do!
Please don't fight with him when you go home, because I told this to you.

Where's the comb?
You didn't even come to admit him in the school!
And the priest is paying the fees!

You will never learn!

We might be a little late.
Keep this on my seat.
What about you?
I'll walk!
Then I'll also walk.
Why?

We organize science fairs to find new scientists  to encourage their talent.
Who knows whether we have an Archimedes or Einstein amongst us?
We have Newton, Sir!
is it?
Did an apple fall on your head?
Not an apple, Sir.
When he was sitting under a coconut tree  thinking, a baby coconut fell on his head!
And when Bindita lost her hair-pin, he was the one who discovered it!
He even put it back on her head, Sir.
Silence!
is that true, Brijeesh?
So, who used to go for the science fairs in the previous years?
It was Aby, Sir.
And where is he?
He is in the workshop, Sir.
He will either be in the lab or in the library!
He does everything alone!
And he doesn't talk to anyone.
We are short of glasses.
Then there's Anumol Xavier.
She is his only friend.
Cinema projector, dairy farm, windmill..
There are many such items.
And he has won prizes as well!
Why did such a talented boy stop his studies?
That's because of his dad!
And there's some fault from his side too!
It was during the last vacation, when NCC's para-sailing camp was happening at the hill-top;
that I understood the gravity of the situation.
'2nd International Para-sailing festival'
Para-gliding!
This was also founded by a foreigner.
David Barish!
If you tie ropes to the four ends of a something like a blanket, and go stand on a hill-top, in the opposite direction of the wind;
the wind sweeps you off and takes you along with it!
It is good fun!
And the para-sailing by NCC;
We can do that!
But we need proper training for that.
Will he jump again?
What happened?
Sir!
Leave me!
Hey, this is not something which you can do on one fine morning.
Sir, please!
It's not conducted by me or our school!
It is by the para military force for NCC students who were selected from different parts of the country!
Such a pile-on!

Anyway, let him finish his exams, Baby.
What's he going to do for this exam which he's been writing for the past 3 years?

Anyway; with that Aby's schooling was stopped!
Nothing is in its place here!

In the Revenue department.
Then shave off that beard of yours!
Your Tyre on the back-wheel was worn out.
Hey flying machine!
There's something at home which he made from last month's wage.
Something this long!
Anyway, he would have his own needs, right?
Needs!
Why is this guy like this!
Send Aby to get some fish.
Can't you see that he's working here?
He is busy!
What's he busy with?
He's making a project for the science fair.
Aby, come here.
Go Aby!
Or she won't let me be at peace.

Afterthis year's science fair, everyone will know..
who the actual Newton is!
You think that you are brilliant, because everyone keeps praising you!
Brilliance!
I will show you what that is!
Dude, once the science fair is over, Anumol will come behind me.
Too woo her, I'll use this brain of mine to the fullest!
She will come behind me like this!

What nonsense are you talking?

What do you want?
I want the money  the patent!

Who are you to ask me to get lost!
Hey, you take the award!
At least give the money to him!

So you want to fly?
Yes!
Before that, you will have to do certain things.
Team drc
There's one more thing that you'll have to do.
What is it?
How do birds fly?
And, have you noticed a bird's wings?
It will be curved in the front, shrunk towards the back, and the tips would be closer.
In our engineers' lingo, this shape is known as 'Air Foil'.
When it cuts across air, and goes forward, the speed of the wind which flows above the wing will increase.
So the pressure over there will decrease.
When the speed of the wind that flows beneath it decreases, the pressure upwards would increase.
It is this pressure, or this lift, which makes a bird fly!
Consumed by the desire to fly, so many mad-men like you  me, tried tying wings to their hands, and running by spreading a cloth;
and did so many other experiments which failed!
It was the result of their hard work;
The Airplane!

Baby, each person in this world lives to achieve their dreams!
What if his dream is to fly?
He's saying that he wandered around for 6-7 years forthat and learned about it!
Ya right!
As if making an airplane is as easy as making a straw ball!
Whatever it maybe!
After wandering around for a long time, some people will do well in life.
But he hasn't!
His bloody airplane craze!
Baby, if he wants to live here, he has to live obeying me.
Or else, I won't let him enter this house!
How can you say that?
Aby, wait!
Don't go!
Stop there!

The trouble is only when you talk to me like this!

You're all standing here?
Then buy 10kgs of rice and 5kgs of tapioca as well!

My husband was coming back on a train from Chennai.
When he saw him first, he couldn't recognize him!
But after they started talking  got acquainted, they kept talking for the whole night without any sleep!
When the train reached Aluva,
Here's some water!
Nivin Pauly took my husband's mobile, added his number on to it, and left.
And my husband came back home!
These calls started thereafter.
What did he say?
He asked me when your due date is.
That's what's called affection!
Mutton Biriyani for the unborn child?

Pipe, steel, scrap;
Like hell you're going to fly with all this!
I heard everything, bro!
I am proud!
You should fly!
You will fly!
Gosh!

We have to get it exchanged, for a different brand.
Its has to be exchanged, it seems!
I want it today itself.

Please Kunjuttan Chettan!
There you go again!
I'll be upset if you talk like this!
Beauty?

Leave all that, Kochappu!
Tell me if there are any well-settled guys with a good job, we'll see!
Then we can proceed!
What is it, Sir?
A boy from Koratty.
He is into business.
Was thinking if he would be suitable for Anumol.
That won't be necessary!
Why?
Start the car!
Start the car, you fool!
My hands  legs are shivering, Sir!
I haven't filled my tank, Sir.
I was talking about the diesel tank, Sir.
Sister Glory left it here.
It's German.
Have a drink, Xavier!
Tell me the matter, Father.
Once we arrive at a solution for this, I'll decide whether I should drink this or something else.
Xavier, your daughter is not a little child.
Whatever precautions we take, whatever has to happen will happen!
Your mom stays with you?
No problem at all!
Have it!
Give it to him.
I'll take it myself.
What is this?
Oh God!
Have the snacks!
She's our only daughter.
That's because you weren't capable of more!
Hey Anu, bye!
OK.
Bye!
I understood that when you were talking to him for so long!
You had so much to say?
Shouldn't I tell him everything beforehand?
Everything as in?
Did you talk about that fellow?
I'll show you what I can do!
Hey you!
You bloody son of a plane!
Hey!
Use these pipes  screw-drivers to the con the townsmen!
If you try to mess with my family, I'll pull your screw out!
Why are you silent?
If you do that, I'm not like your dad, I'll torch this whole damn thing up along with you!
Switch off the fan!
My 'Mundu' is gone!
My 'Mundu' is gone!
Wait  watch!
- From an initial fascination,
- Thonekkunnu has become an entire town's focal point!
- We're witnessing the dream of this young man called Aby turning into the dream of the entire town!
When the plane goes through outer space, how do the people inside it breathe?
They will adjust with whateverthey have inside it.
Brother, which is the way to Thonekkunnu?
Make this turning, turn left and go straight for 1 .5 kms.
Thank you, brother!
-An entire village is praying for Aby.
Everyone is going to Thonekkunnu.
All these people will not let me..
Of course!
- What's such a big deal over there?
Already some 60 people have gone there since morning!
They won't even let me do business in peace!
Aby's...
Brother!
Why has he kept it on top of the hill?
Because the hill is not too farfrom the sky!
Baby is here!
Are you coming back after seeing the plane?
Ya right!
You carry on!
The plane flies through the sky and not through the road, right?
- Stop!
So you aren't coming from there?
Let's go!
Team drc
Aby, look!
Come!
Get up!
Move a little!
As there are only a few days left , for your childhood dream to turn into a reality, what do you want to tell the world, Aby?
I have notjust one, but two desires.
One.
I want to fly!
I want to marry Anumol!
Oh my God!
Everyone, please make some way.
All the gentlemen are here?
is he planning to fly it?
What else?
Why would anyone take so much effort to keep it on ground like this?
Father, I had told you long back itself, that it can't be flown so easily!
And then KSEB, security forces and many more.
Even if he gets permission from all these places, he'll have to pay Rs.1 lakh as security deposit in DGCA.
Without any of these, how can he fly itjust like that?
Father, what are they doing?
I'm telling this to everyone!
You believed that boy and..
How do you know if it will fly?
My dear Sir, forthis, some really efficient pilots or engineers, who have a Civil Aviation License, should come.
And then they have to approve that this is all right.
Then you have to get permission.
Without any of these..
Suppose you've got the permission;
What if he flies it and dumps it on top of a house or inside the dam?
It will become my responsibility then!
Breaking the law;
deliberate intention to kill people;
there are many such sections!
My dear Father, make him understand the gravity of this situation.
What is wrong with him?
What are you living for?
For me and my family!
But he is living to fly!
If we have all these documents, he can fly, right?
You can fly!
Okay then.
But these documents are required!
Okay!
I've got muscle cramps!
I can't bear it!
No use!
Get some tough muscles, I say!
Oh my God!
Phew!
I had such a hard time trying to convince her!
I got out saying that I have to get some ready-made clothes for our shop.
We'll buy some!
There you can get clothes in latest fashion!
If she knows this, she will poison me!
Kurti from Pantaloons;
You'll get all this at Shopper's Stop.
And there's one more item..
These are tunics!
You didn't like it?
Why did you go to Bangalore?
For this!
What did I do?
Even though I've been trying to hit on your daughter for 10-20 years, I haven't got even a handshake from her yet.
Then what the hell do you think I have done?
You know how depressing it is?
Sheesh!
Anumol!
The aircrafts that we make, work purely based on mechanism.
But this one, has his soul in it!
Who is it?
It's me!
This is his money.
The money I made by using him during his childhood.
'Aby is ready to fly high'
He didn't take a farmer's loan for 2 crores and say that he can't pay it back, right?
is it fair if you say that the boy cannot fly something which he made after years of hard work?
What he's saying is true, Sir.
Please consider this with all your heart.
Team drc
Where were you up to at the village office?
I went there to give an application for Aby.
You  your bloody Aby!
I will kill you!
Mix some more of herjapang gopang Horlicks  give her!
Hey,
Sir isn't here.
You may go  come later.
We've got all the other papers.
The only one left is from KSEB.
If we get that as well, they're saying that we can go ahead with the proceedings for you to fly.
It's actually a very simple matter.
But yourfather should show some mercy.
As if he's waiting for us!
I'm afraid if he would do something drastic, if he's not able to fly!
Keep quiet, Father!
Papa!
I know you're doing all this because of your love for me.
What I have for Aby is also love.
But I know that he loves flying more than me.
If he doesn't fly, he wouldn't be there amongst us, Papa!
I'll obey whatever you say, Papa.
I'll marry whoever you want me to.
It's okay even if I fail.
Let him fly, Papa!
It's working!
This village's homegrown pilot Aby, is getting ready for his first experiment.
For Aby, who was born with wings, this would be just a rehearsal.
Only if shows a satisfactory performance in this flying, he will be able to get a license to fly alone.
I've reached the main junction!
How do I come from here?
Engineer!
Okay!
It's a powered hang-glider.
Anyone can make this.
I will make an airplane!
Later!
As the uncertainties have cleared,
Mariyapuram village's own pilot Aby, is getting ready for his first flying trial.
under the supervision of aircraft designer GK Menon.
- Anyway, let us wait  watch how this trailer is, before we watch the film!
- Linju Gopakumar for Mindvision, with cameraman Biju Basil.
Everything is ready here forthe flying trial.
Watch where you're going!
He's going to fly, right?
One second.
Sir, just a second!
They have started flying, Sir.
But..
Stop it!
There are some proceedings to be cleared for security reasons.
Move away!
is he a mental case?
Get down, you...
Team drc
A letter has gone to DGCA's central office, saying that his mental fitness documents should be evaluated once again!
From where?
KSEB?
You can fly after clearing all that!
Father, didn't I warn you that this'll be a headache for us?
I sent it long back.
It was a complaint I gave long back.
But I would never..
I also want him to fly!
Believe me!
Baby, leave him!
Stop it!
If you mess around, no one will leave from here!
No way, Sir!
If he's from Mariyapuram, if he was born in this village, we will make him fly today, Sir!
It's his long time desire, Sir!
Maintain the same level!
I am his friend.
We've been friends since childhood!
What is it, Sir?
Do you feel like flying?
The thrill of flying, lf you experience it once;
even if your legs are on the ground;
your eyes would always look up to the sky!
