Previously on " The Americans"...
That's my son.
Our son.
You missed the meeting.
Stay away from me.
The CIA is planning on squeezing Burov in Moscow with the tape I made.
You remember three years ago when that KGB officer was killed?
I shot him.
If the CIA uses the tape I made to blackmail Burov,
I will go public.
Half our grain comes from America and its allies.
If they're doing something to it, people will starve.
The lab has a contract with a-a company called AgriCorp.
This is Benjamin Stobert from the Rolodex.
We also think Deirdre Kemp is a good bet.
- You like him?

The guy's laughing while he's trying to starve an entire country.
Problem?
This is the worst VA hospital, budget-wise, I have ever seen.
You people have to get computerized.
I work for the government.

There's a program called Lotus 1-2-3.
It would save you a lot of time.
M-Maybe I could pitch that to my boss, if I knew what I was talking about.
I can show you how it works.
So, 10 minutes prep, and you pop it in the oven for 35 minutes.
- That's all?

You know, I used to make my own tomato sauce, but now with my schedule so crazy,
I just buy it out of a jar.
I not think Pasha will like eggplant so much.
Oh, don't tell him what it is.
I can't tell him nothing.
But I hear what you said.
I give him "space."
Now, he have too much space.
Right.
Me at home all day...

I go crazy.

So, I have interview tomorrow.
- Where?

Alexei tell them about me.
That's great.

Uh, Russian language instructor for specialists, uh, who study agriculture in Soviet Union.
You are perfect for that.
Oh, I don't know.

No, you are.

Hi!
Hey.
You good?
Great.
Do you want to hear about Lotus 1-2-3?
Sure.
I can show you some printouts.
*THE AMERICANS* Season 05 Episode 05 "Lotus 1, 2, 3."
walked out of the supermarket, left a half-full shopping cart.
We got a couple more we'll pitch this week.
All right.

Keep going.
"Good job"?
I told you...

We'll see if you get a bite.
Well, none of these guys look hungry.
You haven't worked outside the Rezidentura before.
It's a different game trying to get sideways into the KGB.
All right, let's say after a couple of months of this we get lucky and one of these guys, some trade rep, is willing to work with us.
What are the odds that he will give us anything that makes it worth all the trouble?
I don't know.
It's not a high-percentage game.
This is what we do.
But we approach them, their people have them so terrified, the odds are...
Even if we just scare 'em, we still win.
They report our approach, like they're supposed to, the KGB goes crazy, they send people home, they investigate forever...

If nothing else, we keep the KGB busy and irritated.
Well, we're certainly busy and irritated.
That's a good joke.
He's polite and attentive... even if, like most of the boys his age, his mind wanders easily.
This semester, Henry has really come into his own.
He's...

I don't know how or why, but something has lit a fire under his butt.
- That's...

Which is why I want to move him into Algebra 2.
Now, I know it's a little unusual in the middle of the school year, but we've got his attention now.
We don't want to lose it.
Unless you think it's a bad idea.
- Uh, no.

Yeah, that'd be...
I thought he spent all his time playing games on the computer.
I know.
Henry... our Henry.
I'm good at math.
Evgheniya's applying for a job as a language instructor at the Department of Agriculture.
Sounds like Alexei put a word in for her.
If she gets a job teaching Russian at the CIA...
There's a chance we could get every officer they're training for Moscow.
Hey!
Hey!
Perfect timing!
Me and the boys are gonna see Romancing The Stone.
Come with us.
Bring Paige...

Uh, Paige can't come.

Well, you guys are still invited.
We can grab a drink after.
Yeah, Matthew's staying at Sandra's, so we have to drop him off after the movie.
You know, I-I don't think so.
We... we've been out all day.
- Yeah.

We'll hold you to that.
Uh, next weekend?
Next weekend we're going fly fishing.
Right.
You fly fish?
- Never.

- See ya.

- Hi.

- You hungry?

What say I order Chinese?
- Sounds good to me.

So, your mother and I met with Mr. Jeffries today.
He wants to move you into Algebra 2.
- Wow.

We were pretty much bowled over.
We didn't know you were so good at math.
Yeah, I like it.
Probably why you're so good at it.
Anyway, we were very pleasantly surprised.
You already said that.
No, I know.

It's not like I've seen you doing a lot of studying.
I me...
I'm...

I know what you're not saying, Dad.
Paige is the smart one, she always works her ass off, and she does everything right.
No.

It's okay.

And you had no idea he was messing around?
No.
I think it's easy not to see it.
You think she knew?
I don't know.

You know, that was the only time I ever...
Yeah, she probably knew for a while.
I just kept lying to myself.
Well, I've been there.
- Yeah?

Oh, you're so tight.
What is it?
Oh, j-just stuff from work I can't really talk about.
Can't you just be...

I...
I guess I was a little aggressive about this thing with my boss.
I may have said a little too much.
It'll work out.
Yeah, it will.
The house is dark and the Jeep is still there.
They've been seeing a lot of each other.
We've been giving the Centre a lot of detailed reports about Stan.
They know he's recently divorced.
They know he's vulnerable.
They know he's a loner that would go for her type.
You think we sent her?
I'm just saying...
That's crazy.
You think so?
Hello?
Uh, this is Stacey McAllister.
I need to see Doctor Walters.
Repeat that?
This is...
Stacey McAllister.
I need to see Doctor Walters.
Hello?
Call back tomorrow...

Smells good.
Reserve judgment till after.
What are we having?
Fatta.
It's a...

Oh, that fatta.
It's Egyptian.
I, uh...

- Oh.

It's some...

Anything weird in it?
Are goat eyeballs weird?
No, it's just... uh, it's garlic, white vinegar, rice.
- Hmm.

It's the main meal at the Eid Al-Adha after fasting.
What do you think of the wine?
It's good.

"Omar Khayyam."
Is that Egyptian?
- Mm-hmm.

Well, not a lot anymore.

- Mm.

See, back in the day when the Pharaohs ran the place, the fancy people drank wine.
What'd the regular people drink?
Beer.

You know, traces of red wine were found in King Tutankhamen's tomb, if you can believe that.
I'm boring you?
No.
You know a lot about a lot of things.
I-I get interested, and I...

Okay.
What about you?
Um... okay.
I've never been to Egypt.
I don't know anything about wine.
But I know what I like.
Ready?

Whoosh!
Yeah!
Whoosh!

- Yeah.

Ready?

That's one of them.
Same again.
Hut, hut, hike!
Button hook!
Pretty cool that Henry got moved into an advanced math class.
Yeah.
Turns out he's the brains in the family.
Um.
And I thought studying was the key to success.
You and me both.
You know,
I had a crush on Matthew when I first met him.
He had a lot of hair and played guitar.
And now, he likes me back.
I think I was sort of hoping that... with all of the garbage in my life that... that he would make me feel better.
Being with him only makes me feel worse, though.
I don't know if it's because...
Matthew's not right for me or...
What?
If I'm just...

I'm already so screwed up that... maybe I'm just...

He used Irina's code?
For an emergency meeting with Philip.
I've been tracking every signal Philip gets since Mischa disappeared.
So, he wants to see his father.
All right.
How did he get here?
I'm sure it wasn't a walk in the park.
He's unstable.
Are we talking about Mischa or Philip?
The boy.
He's already been in trouble for speaking out against the war.
It's a complicated war, Claudia.
He fought in it.

His mother defected, he got himself arrested, and now he's come here to see a father he's never met.
I doubt he's stable.
He's his son.
Who he's never seen.
He's too risky.
You don't trust Philip.
It's not about me.
He already has entries in his file that don't look good.
How do you think the people at the Centre are going to feel about a meeting between Philip and his wayward son?
Shouldn't that be Philip's decision to make?
And when he tells Philip he was put in a psychiatric institution because he thinks the war in Afghanistan is a joke...
What happens then?
You care about him.
We both do.
But he's... shaky.
Elizabeth on line three.
Thanks.
- Hi.

Is everything okay?
Yeah.

Is... everything okay with you?
Y...

I miss you.
Me, too.
I've been, um... been having these memories of my childhood.
Of...

My father bringing home food and clothing.
S-So good things?
I don't know.
Yeah, I guess.
Did he bring home other things?
I don't remember.
Yes?
This es... is Stacey McAllister.
There is an appointment available tomorrow... 11:00 AM, Bess Truman Park.
Uh, say again?
11:00 AM, Bess Truman Park.
All right?
Y-Yes.
To old scars and new skin.
How long were you in for?
12 years.

Seven.
Collateral damage?
Just me.
How 'bout you?
Stan's better with the youngsters.
Well, Matthew's been raised right.
Um, excuse me.
Can we have the check, please?
Um, wait...

Not for me... early aerobics class tomorrow.
- Right.

I forgot.
- Um, I'll...

Work's been...
He mentioned it.

He's a good guy.
He puts his whole heart into everything.
Just can't win them all.
So, I shouldn't run for it?
Nah.
Didn't think so.
As long as he doesn't root against the Kings, he's in the clear.
All right.

Thank you.

All right.
You want to get something to eat?
No, thanks.
You want to go to the mall or something?
Not really.
Are you tired of me?
What?
We haven't been alone in almost two weeks.
We've both been busy.
We live across the street from each other, Paige.
Where is this coming from?
D-Do you want to break up with me?
I...
I'm scared.
Of what?
I like you.

But...
I've never had a boyfriend before.
I don't know how to do that.
Yes, you do.
Hmm.

I don't think I've ever seen someone make a s'more inside before.
But that's the whole reason to have a fire place.
Oh, yeah.

- Wow.

Wow.
So, Peace Corps, Egypt, cooking exotic foods, science, sex...
Well, life's short.
What is it that you do, exactly?
Huh!
Well, right now, I'm working on saving the world.
Good luck with that.
You know, when I, uh...

I traveled around and saw children dying because they didn't have enough to eat because half their crops were lost before they could be harvested.
But if there was a grain that could resist pests, drought, fungi, the poorest people in the world could feed themselves...

You see, famines cause wars.
You know, a single pest can cause mass starvation.
You're a real idealist.
No, I'm...

We...

How are you gonna do that?
Well, we, uh... we take the strongest wheat plants from around the world, we cross-breed them, then we get the most destructive pests we can find, test the new plants, and breed again.
And we're... we're making a lot of progress, and we're close to developing the strongest strain of wheat the world's ever known.
And you...
When you have it...
Well, I mean, I-I work for a company, and they sell it.
But it would make food supplies cheap and reliable around the world everywhere...

I mean, it might never happen again.
Old patterns between parents and children create barriers that keep us from seeing what's really there.
And what is really there?
Love.
It's all around us.
But because we can't see it, can't experience it, it seems like it must be very far away.
You can't experience the love your parents have for you or you for your children, when old habits and belief systems...

I am not who you were expecting, I know.
No Russian.

Do you speak English?
Little.
I will take you someplace where we can talk.
You understand?
I want see father.
Yes.
You come with me.
- I will explain everything.

It's impossible.
Why?
It would put him in terrible danger.
It is not safe for him.
But I come for him.
You understand?
I do.
It must be very hard, but if you love him, you must forget this.
You cannot see him.
- Forget father?

Not here.
I will get you home.
You will be safe.
But you cannot see your father here.
Maybe someday, but not here.
Hello?
Hey.
Hi.
Where are they?
Paige is at a church thing.
- At the food pantry?

Um, Henry's studying at Chris' house.
Oh, a boy Chris or a girl Chris?
You got me.
We got it wrong.
Stobert isn't looking to poison us or our food.
He wants to save people.
From what?
Pests, drought, whatever.
He wants to develop a wheat that can grow anywhere.
He wants to feed the world.
So, the bugs in the lab were there to test the crops for resistance, to make sure they could survive anything.
He told you?
Yeah.
You believe him?
Yes.
He wants to end hunger.
So, the guy in the lab, the one we...
We didn't know.
I told Tuan, um...
Yeah, I got to get there.
Pasha says his mother got the job.
When does she start?
Next week.
Will you guys be here this weekend?
No.
Pasha will come by.
It would be good for at least one of you to be here.
Sorry, we can't.
You do very well by yourself.
I know, but it looks better.
You okay?
Yeah.

I mean, I've been better.
I'm fine.
Oh, hey.
Everybody's here.
Yeah.
I'm gonna head upstairs.
That guy in the lab...
That can't happen ever again.
We'll be more careful.
More careful?
This has been hard for me for a long time.
You know that, right?
I do.
Look... when we know this kind of thing is coming up... maybe it can just be me.
No, no.
It's us, Elizabeth.
It's us.
