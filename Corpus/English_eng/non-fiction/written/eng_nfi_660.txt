Something's coming, a wave of radiation that will kill everything in its path.
What if I told you there might be a fallout shelter built to sustain thousands?
A final conclave... one champion per clan, one death instead of thousands.
Then whoever wins gets the bunker.
I was fighting for us all.
Skaikru will not take the bunker alone.
We'll share it.

How could they do this?
Skaikru have betrayed us all.
Bellamy, stop!
The radiation is getting worse, and people are dying up there.
You're gonna have to make it a kill shot.
It's the only way you're gonna stop me.
We have a hundred spots.
The other clans have all chosen their survivors.
We have to do the same.
The death wave comes in 24 hours.
You've got 12 to decide.
Go!

Hey!

Move!

Ethan!
Where's my son?
Ethan!
Have you seen my boy?
Stop pushing.

Skaikru, you move!
Ethan, where are you?
Dad?
Get off me!

Traitor.
Live with Skaikru, die with Skaikru.
Hey, hey, hey, where's Emori?
I haven't seen her.
- Dad?

Ethan!
Oh, thank God.
It's ok.
- Emori!

Are you okay, did they hurt you?
I heard the Warriors talking.
There's only room for a hundred Arkadians in this bunker.
- Get off.

Move!
Jaha!
What's happening?
That's everyone.

Three out of four of these people are going to die tonight.
You still think you made the right choice?
Just hang in there.
We're sending a team to get you today.
You're sure about this?
Yes.
We need you... not just for the hundreds of things we know you can fix, but for the thousands that we haven't even thought of yet.
Thank you, Abby.
I'm just glad you're all right.
You'll be, too.

The seizures have stopped.
When I get there, we use the same procedure on you.
You'll be cured.
Cured?
What's she talking about?
We can talk about that when you get here.
Our people are scared, Marcus.
We need to tell them something.
We just spoke with Raven.
When she gets here, we'll have all our essential personnel.
How many spots does that leave us with?
Including the essential personnel and the places that we're holding for the children under 16, that leaves us with 80.
80.
I can't believe we're talking about sending 364 of our own people to their deaths.
We're lucky they're giving us any space in this bunker at all.
Look.

Then let's fight this.
No.

Our best course of action is to hold a lottery for the remaining spots.
It's not going to work, Marcus.
It was your idea.
That was for the chance to survive.
And how is this any different?
Until 20 minutes ago, our people believed they were safe.
They let down their guard.
They picked their bunks.
They unpacked their bags.
They imagined their futures.
You try to rip that from them now, and, believe me, they will fight.
No one's saying it's gonna be easy, but we need to make the people listen to reason.
Someone still needs to get Raven.
I'd like to volunteer.
And I'll join you.
No.

Mom, look, Raven needs our help.
I know the way to the Island.
I need to do this.
Well, you be safe.
There'll be a place for both of you when you get back.
- I'll meet you in the airlock.

At these radiation levels, any amount of exposure is harmful.
Keep the suit sealed at all times.
You have 23 hours until the death wave hits.
On a good day, it takes 10 hours to get to the Island and 10 hours to get back.
That doesn't leave you much room for error.
Mom, I know, ok?

I love you, Clarke.

This isn't good-bye.
Mom, I know what you saw in that vision, but I'm a Nightblood now, I mean, right?
Maybe it worked.
Clarke, listen to me.
I told you there were no good guys, but that's not true.
There are.
You are.
Even though I didn't want to open the door?
Yes.
There was no good choice.
There never is.
Take care of each other.
Yes, ma'am.
You got room for two more?
Murphy, what are you doing here?
We heard you were going after Raven.
We just want to help.
I've been to that island dozens of times.
No one knows the water better than me.
Maybe it'll help our chances if we bring home the chosen ones.
There's a lottery.
I'll make sure that your name is in it.
And Emori?
I'll do the best I can.
This way.
What are you really up to, Murphy?
You killed us when you opened that door.
You know that, right?
Oh, what, did you think our people are gonna waste a spot on Emori, on me?
We were safe, and you screwed us.
You want to know what we're up to?
It's called surviving.
There's a bunker on that island.
You're our ride.

That bunker's not stocked, Murphy.
You won't last five months, let alone five years.
No.

At least we'll survive the death wave.
We can't all be essential personnel or have a sister who's queen of the Grounders.
We have faced extinction before, and we have persevered, but we have always been familiar with sacrifice, and today we will be tested once again.
The ground won't be survivable for five years.
We've confirmed that this bunker can only generate oxygen and food for 1,200 people for that length of time.
By mandate of the conclave, our clan has been given 100 spaces, an equal number of spots as all the rest.
To fill them, we will hold a fair lottery.
We will hold a fair lottery, an equal chance for everybody.
How long do you think the Grounders would last in here without us?
Our people know how to operate oxygen scrubbers and hydro farms.
- Yeah!

We're gonna be running this place.
We deserve more spots.
I don't like this any more than you do, but we must call upon the better angels of our nature to guide us.
Like the culling on the Ark, some must die today so that our people may survive.
What about her?
Is her name in the lottery, too?
We're just gonna let some Grounder take a bed from one of our own?
- Right!

I say we let her own people save her.
- Yeah!

We've come too far to turn on each other now.
You're just saying that because you know you're safe.
Let it go, Hardy.
Let's throw her out.
Leave her alone!

Guard, stop them.
Stop them.

Let go of me.
Niylah, you're with me.
She's safe.
You now have one less spot to fill.
Octavia, please.

You're Skaikru.

I'm one of you?
You made me hide under the floor.
You floated my mother.
I'm not hiding now.
Don't do this.
Every other clan has chosen their survivors, every other clan.
Skaikru is no different.
You have until midnight.
Choose, or you all die.
Are you ok?
They're scared.
We all are.
It's human nature to fight.
I'll never forget that you did for me.
A word, Octavia?
I fear this will only get worse if Skaikru can't decide.
You know how this has to end.
What if I can't do it?
You gave your terms.

I know this is hard, but you're the champion, Octavia.
Wonkru looks to you now.
They will do what needs to be done.
You just need to give the command.
I'm no champion, Indra.
I hid.
Ilian helped me.

I didn't do this on my own.
No leader ever does.
You said what's to be safe.
I never felt that way before...
Like I had a home.
Hey, your home is with me, ok?
Why did you come on this mission, Clarke?
Raven's my friend.
Yesterday, you were fine leaving your friend out to die, my sister, too, Kane...
I wasn't fine with it, and you know that.
Bellamy, I never meant to hurt you.
Aiming a gun at me is a strange way of showing it.
I didn't pull the trigger.
Is that supposed to make it ok?
Nothing is ok.
Whatever choice I make, somebody always dies.
Well, not shooting me, that was the right choice.
Look out!
Hold on.
Are you ok?
- Yeah.

He just jumped right out in front of us.
It's like he wanted to die.
Stay here.

Bellamy, Clarke, incoming!
Get behind me.
John!
Emori!
Emori!
John!
They want our suits!
There might me more of them.

Echo, what are you doing here?
I know about your bunker on the Island.
I just saved your lives.
I'm hoping you will return the favor.
Unless we can get another ride, no one's making it to that island.
Here goes nothing.
NATE MULLER
- David...

Nate's already put his name in, but I'd like to give him my slot, too, if that's ok.
I want to give him the best chance.
Of course.
Ok.
One minute.

It's not your fault.
Yes.

I opened that door.
You did what you thought was right.
Was it right, Marcus?
Yes.
We do what's right, and 364 people die.
You saved so many others.
You saved me, and I don't mean just by opening the door.
I don't know who I am anymore.
The things that I let myself do in that lab...
I told you, we will find our humanity again.
I need you to pull 81 names from the bowl.
Abby...
When that door closes today,
I need to be on the other side.
Please.
I just got you back.
Don't say that.
I love you, Marcus, but I made my decision.
My life isn't worth more than theirs.
I need you to pull 81 names.
Sir, can I talk to you?
Of course, Geoff.

If my name isn't called, would you... take care of my boy?
It's not fair of me to ask.
None of this is fair.
Your son shouldn't have to grow up without a father.
We shouldn't be lining up to die.
We should be fighting for our right to live.
How?

If we don't do this lottery, all of us will be killed.
- Not if we have leverage.

If you can get the Grounders to open those doors again,
I'll do the rest.
We save our people today, all of our people.
Monty, do you read me?

Here.
Monty, do you copy?
This suit will prevent you from getting worse.
It's the best we can do right now.
You'll get used to it.
Monty, do you read me?

Roan banished me.
I heard.
Monty...
I was only trying to save my people.
Monty, do you copy?
Is that so wrong?
Bellamy, come in.

Yes, Monty.

Two clicks outside Polis.

- Everything ok?

Look, Monty.

We need you to come reel us in.
We save our friends.
I love you.

We're on our way.
Tell us exactly where you are.
No.

You've been exposed.
How's that possible?

I...

The seal of her helmet's torn.
Can you fix it?
We just need tape.

We don't have any tools or weapons.
So we give her the extra suit, then.
We don't have another suit.
Yes, we do!
Take it off now.
I saved your life.
What were you gonna do if we didn't get attacked, huh?
I mean, you guys seriously think she was following us out of the kindness of her own heart?
No.

- Give me the suit.

- What?

You cut that suit, and it saves no one.
I'm not letting her die.
Neither am I.
Clarke, what are you doing?
I have Nightblood.
Untested Nightblood.
We're testing it now.
Take off her helmet.
There.

Ok.

Bellamy, you there?

Yeah.

Head Northeast from Polis, and, Monty, drive fast.
We have to talk about it.
Missed the window.
Continue on to the Island, we won't make it back.
What about them?
Do we just save ourselves?
Clarke, if Nightblood works, we need to get you to Polis, them, too.
We pull in as many people as we can before the death wave hits.
If your mom can make us all Nightbloods, we only need to stay down there until it passes.
We can still save everyone.
Just not Raven.
We got here as fast as we could.
Clarke, you're exposed.

- Let's get you into the rover.

I'll grab the extra helmet.
Guys, come on.
Planet ain't getting any less irradiated.
Here.

The helmets don't match.

I got this.
- Help the others into the rover.

Clarke, you need to put on the suit.
It was for Jasper.
At least now it'll do some good.
You should put it on.

If we're still gonna make it to the Island, we better...
We're not going to the Island.
Yes, we are.
Clarke...
Nightblood doesn't work.
We don't know that yet.
Luna got sick before she got better, so...
Even if you're right, they won't let us all into the bunker if I'm still sick.
It took days for Luna's resistance to kick in, and by that time, the death wave will already be here, and all our friends will be dead.
Are you ok with that?
You know I'm not.
Clarke, unless I am missing something, there is no other way for all of us to survive.
What if there is?
Pei Chao.
Sonya Hassler.
Nate Miller.
Kimberly Ginsberg.
I'm not leaving.
If your name's not picked, I'm not going, Dad.
Hey, hey...
It's gonna be wonderful, Nate.
You're gonna rebuild the world.
Paula Sevaga.
Jackson, will you take over from here, please?
Doug McCrae.
We don't have to do this.
Please.

You're wrong.
Jaha has a plan to save us, but we have to stick together.
When those doors open, follow my lead.
It's our best chance.
That's enough.
We can't do this.
I don't know about you, but I am not about to be led to the slaughter.
I intend to fight.
- Yeah!

Who's with me?
Fight!

Fight!

Marcus.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
I am not losing 364 people today.
I did not find this bunker just so we can kill ourselves in it.
So you're gonna what?

You gonna gas the Grounders, knock them out?
Is that it?
Yes...
And then we threaten to destroy the crops unless they make room for our people.
You can't be serious.
Once we have the food, we have the power.
We call the shots.
We found the Skaikru Armory.
They are our guns now.
We can't wait any longer.
Your orders?
I'll be right beside you.
Pass out the guns.
There's a thousand Grounders in this bunker.
You'll never make it to the food, even with the gas.
We'll see.
Thelonious, just stop.

It'll be a bloodbath, and you know it.
How many would have to die, all of them, all of us?
As many as it takes.
If we fight, then we die.
Just...
The time for diplomacy is over, Marcus.
Now either you lead us into battle or get the hell out of my way.
Thelonious just... just stop.

Just listen to me, I'm begging you.
You found this place when nobody else believed you.
You... you saved 1,100 Grounders.
You saved humanity, but if you don't stop now, you're taking every bit of that salvation back.
This is your moment.
Fight!

Fight!

Fight!

Your people need you.
Listen to them.
They want to fight.
How do we stop them now?
I'll do this for you.
No.
My people, my responsibility.
Now.
This is how we save our people.
Marcus, how do we choose?
We already have.
Clarke's list.
It was always our best chance for survival.
And I know where it is.
FROM THE ASHES WE WILL RISE
This is how we save our people.
¶ World is covered... ¶
He stays.
¶ By our trails ¶
¶ Scars we cover up with paint... ¶
No.

¶ Watch them preach in sour lies ¶
¶ I would rather see this world ¶
¶ Through the eyes of a child ¶
¶ Through the eyes of a child... ¶
He goes.
¶ Darker times will come and go ¶
The son stays.
¶ Times you need... ¶
No.

She stays.

¶ And Mother's hands are warm and mild ¶
¶ I would rather feel this world through the skin of a child ¶
Forgive me.
_
What are you doing here?
We're not leaving you behind.
But there's no time to get back.
We're not going back.

Oh, don't look so surprised.
It was all your crazy idea to begin with.
Space?
We don't have enough fuel to get down.
Sounds like a five-year problem to me.
You're talking about the ring.
Seems like a shame to let a good rocket go to waste.
How do we live?
They left a water reclamator there, and we know that Go-Sci has an algae farm.
We just get those two things up and running, and we have food and water.
Algae salads and recycled urine.
- Sign me up.

- Yeah.

Breathing's important, too.

Based on what Murphy says about the lighthouse bunker,
I'm guessing... make that praying... there's an oxygenator there.
We take it with us.

Bob's your uncle.
You're an engineer, Monty.
You do know there's about a thousand things wrong with that plan, right?
Yes, and every one of them kills us.
Of course, staying here will kill us, too, so...
Raven, we need you to get us off the ground before the death wave hits.
What do you say?
Can you do it?
What do I say?
I say that death wave can kiss my ass.
Good.
It's settled, then.
We're going back to the Ark.
