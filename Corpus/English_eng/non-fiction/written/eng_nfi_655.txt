The walls gave the people a century of peace and security.
The terror of being at their mercy and the humiliation of being trapped became a distant memory.
Until...
The battle for humanity's survival began the moment the Titans breached the wall.
After innumerable casualties among soldiers and civilians alike, it was learned that some Titans were hiding among the humans.
Nevertheless the next threat to humanity was already close at hand.
Hey!
Look!
It can't be!
Your orders, Section Commander?
Was that there just by coincidence?
Or does this mean...?
Pastor Nick?
Whatever you do you must keep that Titan out of the sunlight!
Huh?
"Beast Titan"
For now, we've covered the Wall Titan with sheets.
We'll take more proper measures after sunset.
I see.
What are we supposed to make of this, Sir?
I never imagined there were Titans in the walls...
No one did.
There were only people who knew, and people who didn't.
Business as usual.
But what's scummiest of all is that there's no "official" reason why all these people died.
Now then, it's time for you to talk.
What is this Titan?
What is it doing inside the wall?
And... why did you people keep this a secret all this time?
I have work to do!
My church and followers have been devastated!
Now let me back down!
Certainly.
Will straight down do?
Section Commander!
Stay back.
Enough of this!
To take back our freedom from the Titans!
I was willing to sacrifice my own life for that cause!
And if you won't talk, I'll try the next person.
Your measly life wouldn't make up for much, anyway!
Let... go of me!
Yes!
Section Commander!
Kill me and learn!
We will fulfill our duty, without fail!
So let go of me this instant!
Tell me, Pastor Nick...
Are all the walls made of Titans?
Section Commander...
Whew, I forgot how this feels.
I haven't felt this way since my first time outside the walls.
Talk about terrifying...
Hurry!
There are Titans inside Wall Rose!
"12 hours earlier"
"South of Wall Sina"
My village isn't far south of here, you know...
My hometown is close by, too...
Maybe I'll sneak out at night.
They told me not to come back until I'm normal.
They told me I was too puny to be a soldier.
I'm gonna go make 'em eat their words.
Doesn't it seem strange?
We're on standby in our plain clothes, and we're not allowed to train or wear our uniforms.
Even more suspicious is that everyone else is fully armed.
We're inside the wall, not on the front line.
Who are we fighting?
Well, there are bears in the area.
Guns are enough to handle bears.
Huh?
Get serious, Sasha.
If you're suggesting there are Titans here that'd mean Wall Rose has fallen.
Miche?
Huh?
Notify each district!
There are likely no Titans among the 104th Cadet Corps recruits!
Multiple Titans from the south!
Wall Rose has been breached!
Everyone here?
Nanaba?
Multiple Titans, 500 meters to the south.
They're coming right this way.
There's no time for you to gear up.
Take your horses and evacuate all nearby homes and settlements.
Understood?
From... the south?
Miche.
There are nine in that swarm up ahead.
They've broken through Wall Rose.
We never managed to uncover the Titans' secrets or figure out what they are.
And now the day has come.
Humanity has lost.
Only when a person stops fighting do they lose.
As long as we continue to fight, we are not beaten!
As soon as the Titans reach the woods, we'll split into four teams of recruits and soldiers alike, and then simultaneously scatter in each direction!
Avoid combat when possible and focus on getting the word out!
M-Me!
My town's north of here!
I know the lay of the land well!
And... so does Conny!
My village...
My village is to the south where the Titans are coming from.
All right.
You'll guide the southern team.
Yes, Sir!
I'll come with you, Conny.
You coming, Bertholdt?
Of course I'll come.
As you may know, today marks the new darkest day in humanity's history!
If ever humankind needed to give its all, that time is now!
The Titans have reached the woods!
Scatter!
Ride as fast as you can!
They all started sprinting!
Gerger!
Take charge of the southern team!
U-Understood.
Have faith in him!
His skill is second only to Captain Levi!
He'll make it back alive!
Oh, Eren.
Did you get into another fight?
So, I assume Mikasa had to come to your rescue again?
Thanks.
Eren.
No matter how cruel someone is or how much you hate them, you can't always charge at them head-on!
You're a man!
That's...
It fell.
That thing's seen better days.
I'll get you a new one if I see any in our supplies.
This is really bad!
Can you go?
Not like there's much choice.
It was wise to have Section Commander Miche watch the 104th.
I believe he can handle the situation.
Yes.
Let's hope so.
Four left.
No, it's time to go.
I've bought enough time.
Still I am concerned about that Abnormal.
It's different.
And I've never seen a Titan covered in fur before.
It's just walking around instead of coming for me.
It's definitely an Abnormal, but...
I won't need to hold out until nightfall.
You can't be serious!
Wait.
Tell me, what is that weapon called?
That thing on your waist that flies around.
I'm certain we speak the same language.
Perhaps you're simply too frightened.
Oh, I see you use swords, too.
I guess that means you know we reside in the nape.
Ah, well, I'll just take it back with me.
Only when a person stops fighting do they lose.
As long as we continue to fight we are not beaten!
You can move now.
So you can speak.
I must say, what a clever idea.
Titans have suddenly appeared inside Wall Rose.
The recruits from the 104th Cadet Corps scatter across the land to spread the news.
Meanwhile, Eren and the others head to their rescue.
And after returning to her hometown,
Sasha comes face-to-face with her past.
