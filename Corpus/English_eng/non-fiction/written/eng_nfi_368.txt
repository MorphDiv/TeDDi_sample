No.

I cannot let you do this, Romeo.
Then you'll have to raise a sword to me, and that, my father would kill you for, cousin.
Benvolio:

- I do not.

Benvolio Montague.
Rosaline Capulet.
Escalus, you must always put Verona first.
Yes, Father.
Lord Capulet:

Lord Capulet.
Lord Montague.
Escalus:

Not like this, brother.
Friar Lawrence:

Rosaline:

Juliet:

Romeo:

She's my fiancée!
Aah!
[Gasps]
A curse on the house of Montague!
[Indistinct shouting]
If you'd killed Tybalt yourself instead of letting Romeo do it, neither of our families would've lost their heirs.
Did you never think you could've kept Juliet from marrying my cousin in the first place?
Maybe all this is on you.
To cement your families as allies, I order the marriage of Rosaline Capulet and Benvolio Montague.
So, you'd sell me off to a man I hate?
We cannot be a city divided.
♪
Leave Verona?
Why?
Because I am an old man.
And come a day not long from now, you will take my place upon the throne.
So I am sending you to Venice.
It's far away from the feud that threatens to rip our fair city apart.
No Montagues, no Capulets.
Just a place where you can learn to rule in peace.
I cannot leave you or my sister or the court.
Or...

It is my great hope that when you become prince, you, too, will know all that goes on in this palace... who is scheming, who is profiting, who meets in secret with Rosaline Capulet in the stables.
I know all, my son.
And I know this... you can never be with a Capulet woman.
What?
We must never choose between Montague and Capulet.
For now, they fight among themselves, as they have for 100 years.
But let the royal family get involved and it will mean the death of us all... mark my words.
No woman is worth that.
But I love her.
[Sighs]
It matters not.
Your things have been sent ahead, my son.
I have to say goodbye.
Her father just died.
I love her.

Can you fix this?

Excellent news.
Lord Capulet:

Come, Rosaline.

Where are you going?
To bed, Uncle.
It has been a long night.
You no longer sleep in the servants' quarters.
Then where am I to sleep?
My Lord, I cannot.
I will not.
[Voice breaking] This is Juliet's room.
Yes, and Juliet is gone.
You are a Capulet Lady now.
It is your duty to behave as one.
And you have been promised.
I'm honor-bound to deliver you to the Montagues well-fed, well-cared for, and with your virtue intact.
And here is where you can best keep an eye on me.
And the door has a lock.

Uncle, what are you doing here?
I'd ask you the same, but your presence in this whorehouse is rather predictable.

You screwed yourself out of the first marriage I arranged for you.
You're not going to screw yourself out of this one.
Meet me outside with your dignity... if you can find it.
[Count Paris winces]
The herbs you gave him aren't working.
Give them time.
Perhaps we should take him to a doctor.
Lady Capulet told you... no one can know Count Paris is here.
Yes, but if he's to stay alive...
Do you question your mistress?
If she says no one's to know, no one is to know.
Lady Capulet:

Lord Capulet:

She can't sleep amongst the servants.
So you put her in Juliet's bed?

Our daughter, whose sweet, precious body isn't yet cold.
Guiliana...
And that insolent girl is already warming her sheets?
The streets of Verona are running with blood.
Did you see what they called Juliet?
"Harlot"!
Who do you think did that?
A Capulet?

Don't let your grief blind you.
Our future is at stake.
Our future is lying dead in a crypt, and apparently, only one of us cares.
How dare you say I don't care!
For Verona, perhaps, but not for your own blood.

Father never had a Feast of the Great Houses before Christmas.
Father never had to.
Yes, of course.
The great ruler whose shoes I will never fill.
I didn't say that.
Escalus:

You've been on that throne a week and there's already been a riot.
Look at us, Escalus...

The Houses of Verona need to see our strength.
You make it sound as if our noble Lords are a pack of dogs in the street.
I'm sure they can be reasoned with, given the chance.
Reason may have carried the day in Venice, but here, people only respond to strength.
How did you reason with Rosaline?
I didn't have to.
I am her prince.
Marriage of Capulet and Montague was the right move, brother.
It raises Rosaline back where she belongs, brings her back to her friends at court.
And the longer their families fight, the weaker Verona becomes.
There is no greater invitation for invasion than a city divided.
I know all the reasons.

Man:

The construction of the cathedral has temporarily sapped my funds.
And... with the loss of my only child, Juliet...
My sympathies extend to all beneath your roof, but your losses cannot also be mine.
[Chuckles]
You can't think that you won't be repaid?
My niece is soon to be betrothed, and I will receive a bride price that... that will more than cover the debt.
My Lord, your promises are as empty as my pockets.
But this kindness will I show... since you are in mourning, I will forgo the interest.
Only worry about the debt that is already owed.
My Lord.
♪
Lord Montague:

This is your inheritance now.
It would behoove you to take an interest.
I have other interests, Uncle.
Yes, I saw.
A century ago, our people were peasants, born with nothing, dying with nothing, making no mark upon this world.
I am offering you all this.
What, exactly, is so difficult about accepting it?
A life that's mine only because your true heir lies dead?
The Capulet girl doesn't want me any more than I want her.
And I may be many things, Uncle, but I've never been with a woman who wasn't willing.
[Scoffs]
Foolish boy.
Love is a matter of lust and circumstance.
The key to our family's survival is power.
When you make Rosaline Capulet Rosaline Montague, you add the power of her name to the money of our House.
What's the first thing you see when you look at Verona's skyline?
Capulet's cathedral.
It'll be beautiful once it's finished.
You'll get no argument from me.
Two weeks ago, I noticed construction had stopped, and I haven't seen a single soul on its scaffolding since.
The Capulets have been building that church for two generations.
Yet not anymore, it seems.
I want you to find out why.
A Capulet architect isn't going to speak to a Montague.
Figure it out or I'll cut you off.
And I think you'll find whores don't tend to spread their legs for the poor.

Livia.

Uncle says you're a Lady now...

What?
Is it true you're to marry Benvolio Montague?
- No, no.

He may have lost his mind, but I have not lost mine.
I will not...

But... if you marry, you and your husband could take me with you.
Do you forget the Montagues killed our father?
I'd rather be a servant until the day I die than be the wife of a Montague.
And I would hope that you feel the same way.
- Rosaline...

How exactly do you plan to get out of it?
I need to speak to the Prince.
Uncle was quite clear you're not to leave the room, and that I was not to let you out or there'd be grave consequences.
So... unless you can get the Prince to come to you...
Is there anything I can bring you, my Lady?
Livia...
Anything at all?
[Sighs]
Actually, there is.
My Princess.
Lord Capulet, Lady Rosaline.
Lord Capulet:

Thank you for agreeing to see me.
[Door closes]
I was thrilled you asked.
- Since you...

I know you're not thrilled with my brother's decision, but if it means that we can be friends again...
I don't want to marry that Montague.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I think your brother made a rash decision.
He is your prince.
If I could just talk to him...
He won't change his mind.
Please.
Don't make me beg you.
Why don't you come to the feast tomorrow night?
Of the Great Houses?
Lady Capulet has declined on account of her grief.
You and your uncle could represent your House.

I would like that very much.
Yes, I will attend.
Thank you... my friend.

Let her go.
Thank you...
Benvolio.
You're a Montague, correct?
I am, sir.
Looks like you're going to have to re-sharpen this one.
You work with stone?
- Sometimes bronze.

Was that niello I saw on the outer frame of the duomo?
Not just a stonemason, but an artist, as well.
It's more of a hobby.
All this talk of Capulets and Montagues... the real war is between artists and patrons.
They use us to increase their power and refuse to reward us for our work.
How can your patron not appreciate this?
The proportions of these windows are perfect.
You are kind, but unfortunately, my patron holds his compliments and his funds too close to his chest.
Really?

♪
Good morning, Uncle.
This is far earlier than your usual rise.
What trouble do you bring me at this hour?
- No trouble at all.

I spoke with Capulet's architect for quite some time.
Capulet owes him and his stonemasons a large sum of money.
It's why they stopped their work with only a month left of construction.
So, Capulet is either cheap...
Or broke.
You did our House proud, nephew.
And I think I have a way to reward you.
Is that so?
You shall accompany me to the Royal Feast at the palace tonight as the heir to House Montague.
I'm sorry, Uncle, but spending an evening with a group of preening noblemen is certainly not my idea of a reward.
Then let's not call it a "reward."
Let's call it an "obligation."

Nurse:

Not well.
I fear he may not last through the night.
What is that?
When my father was a soldier, this was how they treated wounds on the field of battle.
Boiling oil?

Aye.
He may.
Lady Capulet is already sick with grief.
Another loss would be too much for her to bear.
And my station in this house would sink even lower.
So, it's important we try everything we can to save him, wouldn't you agree?
And I am sorry, My Lord.
But this going to hurt.

And ending this feud will benefit us all.
If you think that's all it will take...
Do you have a better idea?
No.

Escalus:

I welcome the Great Houses of Verona to my table tonight to talk about the state of the world and our place within it.
Florence, Venice, Milan... our neighbors all wish to expand their borders and swallow up everything in their path.
I know there is a long history of animosity between some of your families, but I think we all agree that must end for Verona to survive.
So, let us not break bread tonight as Montagues or Capulets or Grimaldis or Ruspolis.
Let us break bread as a united Verona.
To our fair city.
All:

[Indistinct conversations]
As some of you may know, Lord Capulet and I are already putting the Prince's words into action.
My heir, Benvolio, is to marry Capulet's niece.
And in a gesture of solidarity, I'd like to suggest the Capulet cathedral as the location of their wedding.
As it nears completion, I'm sure we can all agree it will be the most beautiful structure in the world.
While I appreciate
Lord Montague's generosity of spirit,
I believe Your Grace would like the wedding to take place sooner than the scheduled completion of the duomo.
I'm sure we could wait.
When will the cathedral be finished?
I will not discuss my business affairs with a Montague.
[Thud]
You Capulets reek of snobbery.
You should be honored that the Capulets would even share a room with the Montagues after what they did to Juliet's statue.
All of Verona knows they only wrote the truth!
How dare you speak of my daughter in that way!
Tell your friends to stand down!
You look to your own affairs!
[Indistinct shouting]
You think you speak to me like that?

I will speak to you any...
Aah!
Sit down.

Perhaps you didn't hear me.
Or you thought my words were mere suggestions, but I assure you they were not.
Peace in Verona is not a request... or a debate.

But that is what perplexes me so.
Not why.
