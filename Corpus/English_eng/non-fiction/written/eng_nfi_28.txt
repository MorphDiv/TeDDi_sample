This is you?

Philanthropist.
People pay for all sorts of things on the Deep Web.
I'm keeping custody of Jacob.
But I lifted the restraining order.
Sometimes people keep trying until they get it right.
Why didn't you marry my dad?
I don't want to talk about it.
it's not!
Jacob.
Dad.
Holy shit.
Let go of him.

She said to please let him go.
Get out!

I will get my son.
My attorney will be in touch.
I need you to kill Sean.
Why are you

Because I am thinking about what you just asked me to do.
Are you thinking about what you just asked me to do?
No.

I don't think you meant to ask it.
I did.
You really want me to kill Sean.
I need you to kill Sean.
Jacob's father.
- Yes.

which is nothing new for you.
These are words I never imagined you would say.
And I never imagined that the man who ruined me would come back

I never imagined

And now he wants custody and he has a lawyer.
I'm sorry.
I could never understand what you went through with Sean.
what he did to you.
So you wouldn't have kept Jacob a secret unless there was a very good reason.
Exactly.
And that man cannot take Jacob.
Do you understand?
I understand.

You must be confident you will get custody.
- What can I get you?

So your girlfriend

Help support you?
She knows I fight my own battles.
Letty wants you to fight this one.
I am not here to fight.
No?

I know why.
Really?
You think I'm a piece of shit.
I don't know you.
So what happened between you and Letty?
She didn't tell you?
not really.
Letty and I had something...
- Something real fucked-up.
But she doesn't take responsibility she turns blame on whatever's close by.
I was close by.
Just an innocent bystander.
I wasn't...

I wasn't a demon.
that was a long time ago.
I've moved on.
I've become a man.
and she is still right where she was when I dropped her junkie ass.
So you abandoned her.
Junkies abandon themselves.
You didn't do drugs.
sure I did.

I didn't even know that Jacob existed until two weeks ago.
She told him I was dead.

I know that.
I'm back from the dead.
Thank you.
So... how do you really know if you want to be a father to Jacob?
How do I know if I want to be a father to my own son?
so you don't know him.
I've spent more time with him than you have.
And that's the problem.
Why is that a problem?
You're not his real father.
I care about what happens to him.
man.
You are disrupting Jacob's life.
He contacted me.
A child doesn't always know what's best.
- I'm about to...

What are you about to do?
I think you should leave.
That's a great idea.
I mean leave.

I have never seen Letty more destroyed than she is right now.
You terrified her.
Leave her alone.
Leave Jacob alone.
Are you kidding me with this?
Jacob's an amazing kid because he was raised by people who cared about him.
And now you just want to take him away from those people... his mother. like she took him away from me.
So you just want to win. but I choose my battles carefully.
Jacob is my son.
That's a battle you choose.

Don't worry.

Unless the mother is me and the father is a manipulative psycho.
I read about a judge who granted custody to a mother who literally traded her kid for Adderall.

I don't want you to kill yourself.
Why would you say that?
Who gave you the impression that I might kill myself?
Dad.
Sean. did you know your mom might kill herself? you would probably kill yourself because of the pressure.
That is a lie.
He told me you tried before.
Did you?
Yes. which has nothing to do with what is happening right now.

Your father is not a good man.

It's okay that you don't know.
My client hopes that... you consider what a significant loss it's been for him to be robbed of the opportunity to know his son.
I would hope your conversation with Jacob granted you some insight into how important Ms. Raines is to her son.
I appreciate all of your points of view.
I know that you love Jacob. but there are a few details that complicate this matter.
Though it is noted that Ms. Raines may be the more natural parent in this case.
And...

Jacob may benefit from a primary caretaker with whom he shares a common culture.
What does that mean?

she's saying something along the lines of blacks should stay together.
that is not what I'm saying.
She's saying Jacob needs a parent who understands what it means to be black.
It could be very good for Jacob to spend more time with someone who has where he came from.
because that's where he came from.
Excuse me.

Ms. Shane.
Are you really making custody recommendations based on something as superficial as the child's skin tone? but racial identity is far from superficial.
You might want to rethink going down... wait.

I'm sorry. but I'm his mother.

I think Mr. Barron makes a good point.
Please listen to me.

He's kind and he's soft-spoken.
Competition and all that male bullshit make him anxious.
but he's fragile.
He gets that from me.

He's also very observant.

I've made a lot of mistakes.

Jacob knows that.
My mother...
My mother has done

But now Jacob needs to know that his own mother gets him.
I get him because he's just like me.
And those ingredients we're made of aren't typical.
but they're intuitive to me.
I'm not trying to win an argument.
I love him

let me be his mom. and a judge will make a ruling by end of day Monday.

This meeting is concluded.
Thank you for
