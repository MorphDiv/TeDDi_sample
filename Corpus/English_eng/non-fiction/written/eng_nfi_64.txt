Hey, thanks again for letting us leave early.
Why exactly are you letting us leave early?
You know what, never mind, I'm not gonna bring it up, 'cause then you might change your mind, and I... want to leave early.
You sure you don't wanna come with us to this off the chain club opening?
I can get another VIP pass, because I am a PR god.
Thanks, Elliot, but I have a college buddy comin' over for dinner.
Okay, so the lobster ravioli is warming on the stove, the side dishes are in the oven, and then there's cream pie for dessert.
Ooh, Boston?
No, right there in the fridge.
Okay, so are you sure you don't need me?
How great is it that Josh is giving us the night off early?
Um... who are you and why are you going here?
He... hired me to serve him and his guest dinner?
And why is that?
Wouldn't you want a professional server if you were having a business dinner with Natasha Cook Campbell?
(gasps) Natasha Cook Campbell!
(urgent knocking on door)
Coming!
My college buddy's gonna be here any minute.
Oh, you mean your buddy, award-winning chef, lifestyle guru, millionaire mogul, and my idol, Natasha Cook Campbell?
♪ She's in the spotlight
♪ And she turned my head
♪ She'd run a red light
♪ 'Cause she's bad like that
♪ I like that ooh, baby, ooh, baby, baby ♪
Okay, you know I'm obsessed with Natasha Cook Campbell.
I mean, she's a genius cook, brilliant businesswoman, she's best friends with Yeezy.
She's everything I wanna be, except for the... little bit of jail time.
You're an obsessed nut job!
I'm trying to do a business deal with Natasha, and the last thing I need is some crackpot trying to steal a lock of her hair!
I'm sorry, Gabi, I can't trust you to act professionally.
Can I just say that if we were in a relationship,
I would be so hurt.
Can I just say this is precisely why we're not in a relationship.
Oh, well, can I just say I'm hurt anyway.
(knock on door)
A multi-million dollar deal's on the line.
I know... and as soon as I get a lock of her hair,
I'm gonna be a hundred percent pro-fesh.
Now excuse me, I have a door to answer.
Welcome, Ms. Cook Campbell.
Ms. Cook Campbell, I'm Josh Kaminski.
Call me Natasha.
Natasha... (whispers) Cook Campbell.
Ooh, Elliot, tonight you went from schmuck to guy I wanna... uch, too far.
But still, I'm impressed you were able to get us tickets.
When you're as well known as me in the biz, you ask and... (snaps fingers) things happen.
Hey, Elliot, do you know who the surprise guest is yet?
Aww, it's so cute when the nothings get excited.
(phone ringing)
Oh, it's the club.
Yes, this is Elliot Park.
Mm-hmm?
The surprise guest is who now?
(gasps) It's Beyonce!
You were saying tonight's gonna be busy, and... what?
You can no longer accommodate me?
But you have to!
For the first time in my life, people are worshiping me.
I'll do anything!
I cannot be a nothing!
Hello?
Oh, no.
So, are we ready to roll?
Actually, there's been an unexpected development.
I knew you wouldn't come through.
Why would you all of a sudden be "the man"?
They... upgraded us to the front row!
I knew you'd come through 'cause you the man!
So we can be the first ones there, and look like losers?
How many times have you two been VIPs at a club?
Take it from a VIP OG.
Beyonce's not gonna go on until midnight.
The cool people show up at 11:45.
And you know what's better than seeing Beyonce?
Aw, yeah, you know they do overcharge.
Or hopefully never remember, what?
Natasha, at Kaminski Enterprises, you're getting more than just an app.
We're gonna take your books, your videos and your recipes, and tie them all together into one digital portal.
Well, no one... except Kiki Cook Campbell.
She's the only bitch I listen to.
(barks)
Kiki, inside bark!
Look, Josh, I'm gonna be blunt.
A little Tash talk, if you will.
You've pitched me the same thing as every other pasty tech mogul in town.
I want to attract a new demographic.
How are you gonna take my "Get Paid" chicken and introduce it to the younger generation?
Your "Get Paid" chicken?
Mm-hm.
(stammers)
It's only her best recipe!
It's called "Get Paid" chicken because when you finally get your paycheck, you can afford to cook yourself a good meal. (gasps)
I have been trying to hip up everything.
Two years ago I rejuvenated my lady business, and it's ideas like that that can rejuvenate my business business!
Natasha, you wanna know what separates me from the other pasty people?
Gabi Diamond!
She's a great chef, beautiful, young, and oh, so fun!
Gabi, I have a great feeling about you.
I think you and I are gonna be writing a cookbook together.
Oh, I'm sorry, I just blacked out for a moment.
You... you wanna write a cookbook with me?
Yes, you have a raw, sexy energy that I want in my books!
(phone rings)
Oh, this is the fifth time my editor is calling me tonight.
Now she could use some of that "Get Laid" chicken.
Hey, Natasha, why don't you take it in my office?
(singsong) I'm writing a book with Natasha Cook Campbell!
(singsong) I'm doin' a digital platform!
Oh my God... could things get any better?
We're a power non-couple!
Oh, Kiki, I almost stepped on you!
(barks)
I didn't throw it over the terrace, I threw it towards the terrace.
How was I supposed to know that balls bounce?
I can't see her anywhere.
Yeah... 'cause she's in heaven.
This is horrible!
Oh my God, she saw.
My editor was in a car accident, I have to get to the hospital.
All right, now where is Kiki?
Uhh... uhh... say, Gabi, where is Kiki?
Oh, Kiki, time to go.
Why don't Josh and I watch her, and you can just come pick her up later?
I could never leave my baby.
But she is my editor.
Oh, God, it's Natasha's choice.
(crying)
Did that seem real?
Because that's what I'm gonna do when they take my picture outside the hospital.
Well, except for my editor, who they think could be dead by the time I get there.
Noooo!
Okay, that one might've been a little bit over the top.
All right, watch my baby for me, please.
Okay, we will!
In honor of Beyonce, all the single ladies do a shot!
Yeah!
Mm-mm!
Now all the divorced ladies do two!
(laughs) My divorce was pretty rough.
E... even though this might make things awkward at work,
Waaait!
You're gonna let Beyonce see you bitches without volume?
Hair flip!
Okay, let's go.
- (exhaling loudly) - (Elliot chuckling nervously)
What did I say before, nothings?
Beyonce-tinis!
A whole Kiki, or in Kiki pieces?
How... how the hell did she survive?
Well, she miraculously landed
(whispered) on this.
And like I told the blonde here, this isn't Kiki, this is Wagon.
Can you believe this place?
Look at the size of that ottoman!
You still have the box it came in?
short for "Off the Wagon," which he clearly is.
Okay... how much for the dog?
I told you, this isn't Kiki, this is Wagon, and Wagon is not for sale.
Hey, uh, Louis... do you...
Here ya go!
Anyway... buh-bye, Louis.
Well... take good care of Wagon now.
I'm off to the bank... or a race track.
We got Kiki baaack!
Why aren't you happy?
Uh, do you not remember that you just cost me $20,000?
Do you not remember how we thought Kiki was dead, and now she's alive, and she's here?
Do you not remember how none of this would've happened
"do you not remembers" because I think we all remembers.
Oh, especially the one where Natasha was out the door until I brought up "Get Laid" chicken!
I mean, if it wasn't for me, you'd have nothing!
Oh, right... because I didn't have my penthouse or... or my company, or my millions before you rhymed "paid" with "laid"!
Have you learned nothing?
You do not throw balls towards the terrace!
(dog barks)
Okay... at a certain point, it's the dog's fault!
(phone ringing)
Okay, but if you don't answer, she's gonna think
Okay, I'm just gonna hit ignore.
Hi, Natasha!
And because I'm talking to you right now, because Gabi gave me the phone, that must mean I'm back with Kiki!
She's alive... force!
She's a life force, just perks up everything around her.
We adore her.
- (barking) - (whistling)
(gasps) Oh my God, she's on the terrace below us, she must've hit the awning and slid off onto the balcony,
Excuse me for being a renter!
Can I just say once again how glad I am we are not in a relationship?
Can I just say I'm gladder!
Can I just say I'm the gladdest, because if we were, I would have to stay here with you, but instead, I get to go home, and I get to watch the horror movie marathon
Insidious, Saw, Silence of the Lambs... (gasps)
Silence of the Lambs, oh my God, the fat girl's stuck in the well, and she puts the bone in the basket, and the dog jumps in, we gotta get a bone and a basket!
(quiet snoring)
(Yolanda sighs)
- (louder snoring) - (pop)
(door slamming)
How amazing was what?
Yeah, fool, what're you talkin' about?
Very funny, guuuys!
(gasps) Two-thirty?
Oh my damn, we missed the whole thing!
Do you seriously not remember anything that happened tonight?
The last thing I remember was you yelling "chug, chug, chug,"
while I drank vodka from a salad bowl.
Yeah, right before our limo showed up.
Limo?
Backstage, you taught Blue how to sing Single Ladies in Spanish.
Todas Las chicas solteras?
Then you and Beyonce stood by a mirror and laughed... because she said you two
Ha!
Yes, it was!
I made out with Beyonce's bodyguard!
(all laughing)
The PR god really came through for you guys!
Chant me out.
God, the nothings are stupid.
(straining)
(gasps) Oh my God, Kiki, you're alive!
Natasha, hey, how's your editor doing?
Oh, she's gonna be fine.
You know, I didn't realize how much I truly cared about her until tonight?
I mean, she's not just my editor.
TMZ ate that up!
Oh, there's my baby!
I hope she wasn't too much trouble.
No, she just... played a lotta fetch.
Anyway... my people will be in touch about the project and the book.
And please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
Well, I do have just one... why does my little girl have a dick?
Uhhh... well, that's a good question.
Uh, first off, are you sure that he has... oh, now I see it.
Where is Kiki Cook Campbell?
Okay, Natasha, here's the thing.
When we were on the phone, we were... we were playing on the balcony, and then... and then Gabi threw the ball, and then Kiki jumped and she fell...
In love!
Kiki?
Yep!
This is so confusing.
Well, you know, with... with all this talk about "Get Laid" chicken,
I looked at Kiki, saw she was alone, and... thought as a fun, sexy story, for... our book, um, I could find her a boyfriend, and I did!
Hence the... dick.
Why is he wearing her collar?
Oh, and look at that, he loves her already.
I'll be in touch tomorrow about the contracts.
If you'll excuse me, I have a doggie wedding to plan and cater.
Third time's the charm.
Bye!
Kiki must've also landed on the awning, slid off, and then, somehow,
My God, you got the deal with Natasha freakin' Cook Campbell.
So did you.
You know, it's too bad we're not in a relationship.
Yeah, but then... someone would do something to make the other one mad.
What could you possibly do to make me any more mad than what you did tonight?
I got her hair!
And then get this...
Beyonce calls me onstage to sing with her!
Oh my God, you sang with Beyonce?
Natasha Cook Campbell's dog flew off Josh's terrace twice and lived, and I still got a cookbook deal out of it!
Okay, Gabi, now it just sounds like you're making stuff up to top my story.
(knock on door)
(Sofia gasps)
This is, uh, Sofia, my roommate.
Hi, Natasha. (laughs nervously)
Latina roommate, small enclosed spaces.
(shudders) Prison flashback.
Well, shall we make this official?
Looks like you could use the money.
Oh, well, where do I sign?
(barks)
You'd think Kiki'd be tired after playin' all that fetch.
Oh, okay... go get it!
- (gasps and screams) - (car horn)
Oh my god!
