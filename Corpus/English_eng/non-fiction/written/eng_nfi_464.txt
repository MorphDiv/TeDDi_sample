Previously on "Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce"...
I have it.

As in soft porn?
Why is the coach so tightly wound?
He's going through some divorce stuff.
Oh, come on, Jo.

I just don't understand what happened.
- I need help.

You just think you do.
Cultural attaché...

There's an opening.

I am going to give you that Viking.
And maybe we can get a drink or something.
- What's happening here?

Are you sure you want to compete for jobs with people half your age?
I thought you got nailed for drunk cycling.
I miss this... you and me swapping war stories.
Peace.
Peace.
I was just calling to schedule my hours this week.
Yes, I know that my requirement has been lifted.
Why are you interested in this work?
- I'm an asshole.

Bald Eagle, right?
- We cannot just leave.

And I have to, and I really hope you decide to come with me.
- And you can't not go through...

It's rare.
And that's why we should stop.

Okay, can I have your attention, please?
We are so excited to welcome you to the launch of... [together] Lady Parts!

And not just us.

Greg and Ellen from Ten Four Capital...
- Thank you.

Our wizard of web-craft, Parker...
And our mega-helpful interns,
Kimmy and Granger.
- Keep Snapchattin', babies.

Lady Parts has been such a passion project for us.
Ever since this one showed up on my doorstep and basically demanded that I drop everything and do this.
Some of you know how persuasive I can be sometimes.
- Little bit.

- Thank you.

Hard truth, sometimes...
About being middle-aged and female.
Our latest election really showed us how challenging it is to be a PPWP.
[together] A Powerful Person With Pussy.

We have managed to assemble a really incredible group of writers and artists and thinkers.

It's like giving birth, minus the pooing and the stitches.
Ew!

I need to be at Legal Aid by 11:00.
- You still in that?

I feel like Erin Brockovich.
Good for you.

Albert?

Yeah, I keep waiting for the old prick to emerge, but... [sighs] So far, so good.
- Okay, whatever.

- Oh!

- Oh, thank you!

Thank you guys.
Where is Phoebe?

I texted her, but nada.
I guess they extended their trip.
- Mm-hmm.

At least Darrell sent flowers.
Hey, where's he this week?
He's working with some billionaire doing his pool house at his French chateau.
- Wow!

- Work, work, work.

Uh, egg yolk, protein powder, and ice.
This is Rex's formula to maintain balance, and it's disgusting, but with my kid not being here, not much balance.
You know what?

Is Zooey digging her semester at the Mountain School?
Ugh.

Literally.

She's happier than a pig in mud.
She was actually supposed to be here, but she's with her dad, visiting him in booze jail.
Well, at least he's staying in rehab.
Yeah.

So it's all about discipline and willpower.
No junk, no booze, no bad shit inside or out.
- Mm-hmm.

Oh, your super sexy sparring partner.
- He was until he won.

Because losing dredges up just a lot of... rage stuff.
But Rex says it's very healthy, so I will be pounding him.
