Previously on "once upon a time"...
Emma.

You have to stop doing that or your mother's not gonna let you keep visiting me.
Henry.
There's my boy.
If we don't stop the black fairy, all the realms will be destroyed and everyone in them.
There was an accident.
Henry broke into his doctor's office, had a nasty fall down the stairs.
I didn't fall.

How could I push him if I wasn't even touching him?
This is all my fault.

And you know what you have to do.
Go on.

Show him that you've truly embraced reality.
Your father wouldn't want you in tears.
Not on his behalf.
Tiger Lily.
What happened here?
Where is father?
I don't know.
But I do know that it's clear he fought valiantly so you could escape.
I never should've left.
I should've fought with him!
No.

Because you did, the book is safe.
We need to take it to your mother now.
She'll be waiting.
But what about father?
You'll be reunited one day.
I promise.

They have?
W-we're going to be okay?
The future is cloudy, but you will be reunited.
After that...
You just need to learn the lesson imparted by this book.
Never lose hope.
It... it can't be.
Well, I'm afraid it is.

Or what's left of it.
No way.

But she did.
Whatever last bit of belief she clung to went up in smoke, just like the pages of your precious book.
Not even you could destroy her belief completely.
If that's so, then why is she packing for Boston at this very moment?
I'll stop you.
Haven't you already tried that?
Look where it got you.
It's not just me.
It's my family.
We won't let you win.
Haven't I mentioned the consequences of Emma's lost belief?
Your family isn't going to exist long enough to save themselves, let alone your mother.
Hurry, mate!
Yeah, I know!
Aah!
Hook!
Aah!
Hoooook!
Aah!
Charming.
Something's wrong.
Where?

I don't know.
Then let's go find him.
David!
David?

David!
David!
Hello there, mummy.
"Mummy?"
There was a...

And yeah, that is still going to take some getting used to.
What happened?
Well, first, I fell, and then... and then it fell, but we managed to get this.
Great!
Where's David?
You mean he's not here?
David?

- He was on that?

We should start searching.
This beanstalk goes on for miles.

Take the bean.

Don't worry about David.

The realms are disappearing.
We don't have much time.
Get to Emma.
It's important.
Make her believe again.
So it's true.
You're really leaving storybrooke.
It's what's best for both of us, kid.
Don't you get it?
This is what she wants.
The black fairy cast the curse so all this would get you to leave.
This is why I have to go, because you still believe this nonsense is true.
- It is.

Don't get me wrong.

And I'm so happy I got to know my son.
But it's so clear now.
Coming to storybrooke wasn't good for either of us.
You're wrong.
Look where I ended up.
Look at you.

It sent us on a dangerous path.
I got to get back to Boston and back to my life.
And so do you.
She did it.
You really don't believe?
There's nothing to believe.
Goodbye, kid.
I love you.
You might not think this story's true.
But I know that it is.
And it can still have a happy ending.
Hello?
Hey, swan, I got your message.
- You back?

Great.

'Cause I got a guy who jumped bail...
A perfect mark for your "first date" trick.
What do you say?
Sounds good.
And you left snow behind?
But I have the bean.

Getting back home to Emma, to Henry.
She'll find David.

Well, we have a problem.
What the devil happened to it?
Emma.

It's sapping the magic from everything here.
Well, can't you fix it?

Well, I can't.

Of course you do, sis.
With a little help from, well, yourself.
The evil queen.
Your evil half is here?
Well, she's not evil.

And yes, she's here.
And you trust here?
Well, of course I do.

And remember, Henry's her son, too.
David!
David!
No, no, no!
No, no!
Please, no!

Please, no!
No.
You found me.
Did you ever doubt I would?
Truthfully, the beanstalk that fell on me gave me pause.
Snow, we're gonna be fine.
Darkness never wins.
It just fools you into thinking it does.
I love you, charming.
I love you, snow.
Let's go.
Mr. gold?
And where do you think you're going to, young man?
That room is off limits to customers.
I'm not a customer.
I'm your grandson.
Is that so?
Yep.
You must've hit your head pretty badly.
Now, if you don't mind, I got work to do, so...

You're awake.
I know what magic looks like.
What are you up to, grandpa?
Clever under any circumstances, aren't you, my boy?
Why have you been pretending?
Because, believe it or not,
I didn't entirely trust my mother when she cast the curse.
And, as usual, I was right not to.
Our agreement wasn't to put me in this pathetic circumstance here without belle.
She betrayed me.
Again.
What are you planning?
To find out her true intentions.
She told me belle was off to see the world, but I know better.
She'd keep her here for leverage, just in case.
Well, belle's gonna have to wait.
Everyone back in the enchanted forest is in danger because the black fairy made Emma stop believing.
You got to help me save my family.
Our family.
And then we can find belle.
I'm sorry, Henry, you're on your own.
All I care about right now is belle.
Fine.
But if you're not gonna help, at least let me take something that can help me.
And what exactly did you have in mind?
Actually...
There's two things.
So, I'm not sure if any of you on the other side are listening, but if you are, I'm sorry.
I tried my best to keep Emma from losing belief, but it wasn't good enough.
But that doesn't mean I'm going down without a fight.
If Emma's not around to take on the black fairy, then I will.
He's going alone.
But how could he win against her if Emma couldn't?
He's a tough boy.
Get that bean working now.
I'm sorry, Regina, but even with our magic combined, it will still take time.
It's on the outskirts of the forest and moving fast.
The magic's almost here.
"Almost."
I'm afraid that's a bit of an understatement.
It is here.
Let's round everyone up, get them to safety.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm going to hold it off as long as I can.
You'll die!
It'll give you a chance to get to the courtyard.
Go to the center of the castle.
You can survive long enough there to get the bean to work.
You just need time.
Let me give that to you.
Regina.
Go.
He's my son, too.
He needs at least one of us.
Everyone, to the center, quickly!
Close together!
Not so fast.
You came back.
Yeah.

Does that mean you...

I...

I was about to take another job and...
And then I thought about this woman you wrote about who was a hero with a family and a savior who never ran from a battle and...
You.
Well, I'm not sure that it's me, Henry, but, um...
But it's who I want to be.
So I don't remember all the crazy stuff you told me, but...
I believe it.
What happened?
Emma.

belle?
Belle?
I don't want to leave!

Please!
Belle.
How do you know my name?
I can explain if you give me a chance.
Leave me alone, okay?

Belle, I know this is difficult to understand...
But...
You're not like this.
The black fairy did this to you.
Changed you.
I promise you, the woman who did this,
I am gonna make her pay.
Madame mayor, what's wrong?
Are you here to pick up your watch?
No, I'm not here for my watch.
I'm here because Emma swan is back.
Sorry.

Are you all right?
Do you need something?
Indeed I do.
There's a fairy wand in this shop.
My fairy wand.
And I need it back now.
A fairy wand?
Perhaps I should call my father.
He'll know what to do.
Drop it!

The last thing I need is gold getting involved.
Why did I do that?
I didn't want to do that.
Despite what your father thinks, I still have your heart.
You have to do whatever I say.
So start looking for that wand now.
What is that?
The runes that Henry scribbled.
It's an ancient language long lost to time.
I need the wand to translate it.
It holds the key to winning the final battle.
Is...
This what you were looking for?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
It's been centuries since I felt its power.
Wonderful.
Time to go to work, Gideon.
Hello, Mr. gold.
I was just here to pick up my watch.
No, you weren't...
Mother.
Of course.
You know, I only separated you from belle for your own good.
She's my wife.
And a terrible one.
She would convince you to go against your dark instincts.
I couldn't let that happen.
But once the final battle is won, the curse on belle and Gideon will be lifted, and I will have unchecked powers.
Not even the laws of magic will apply.
I can make them love you without you having to give up being the dark one.
Don't you realize?
You can finally have it all.
No...
I can't.
I won't trust you.
All you care about's yourself.
I care about you!

And I worked tirelessly to reunite us!
And now we can be a family again.
And not just with belle and Gideon.
What do you mean by that?
With my new powers, I can bring back the dead.
Like baelfire.
Your first son that you lost.
All your desires can be had.
Your magic will really allow us to have it all?
Without a doubt.
Well, there's just one problem.
All magic comes with a price.
And I'm no longer willing to pay it.
You will not be winning any battle.
And you are gonna suffer for what you did to belle and Gideon.
You may think that you can stop me, but that doesn't mean the final battle is over.
After all, I'm not the one who's going to kill the savior.
That's what I learned from the runes.
Darkness can't snuff out the light.
It's not strong enough.
Only light can snuff out light.
Gideon.
You have his heart.
Yes.
And I commanded him to kill the savior.
Not even my death can stop that.
In fact, I suspect it would ensure it.
Well...
There's only one way to find out.
I remember.
Just in time, savior.
Henry.

Rumple?
Belle.
Yeah.

The curse is broken.
When I killed her.
You killed your mother?
W-where's Gideon?
I don't know.
Still under her control.
But I think I know who to ask.
Henry.
C-can you stop him?
I don't intend to stop him.
I intend to save him.
Gideon.
You don't want to do this.
You can't win.
Maybe.

Henry!
Let's go.

- You did it.

That won't hold very long.
It's okay.

Gold's gonna get it.

I appreciate your optimism, kid, but we got to go.
You think his heart's down here?
I know my mother.
This is where she'd hide it.
If I find it...

Belle, you all right?
My ankle.

- Well, let me fix it.

We're racing against the clock.

Go.

Can you see him?
We lost him.

I'm so sorry that I ever doubted you.
I know.

I'm just happy it's broken.
We are, too.
Dad.
Some honeymoon?
We'll get there.

Okay.
She left him with one last command.
Kill you no matter what.
Well, then we'll kill him.
No.

If Gideon kills Emma, then light will be destroyed.
And if Emma kills him, then she'll darken herself and light will be destroyed anyway.
You don't have to kill him.
Just hold him off until gold gets his heart.
Well, there's no holding him off.
But she is right.
It's a trap, and it's perfect.
No matter what, darkness wins.
I'm not telling you to give up.

Emma, you of all people should know, there's always a third way.
Remember when you first came to storybrooke?
We hated each other.
- Regina.

I was Henry's mother, but you said you were.
And we fought.
And boy, did we ever fight.
But you found a third way.
We were both his mother.
Earlier today, I saw my evil half... be selfless.
She saved us all.

Just like however you're going to get out of this, you haven't seen yet.
But you will.
Sounds like you're talking about hope.
Something you taught me all those years ago when...

What should I do?
You'll know when the time comes.
I'm afraid that time has indeed come.
- Son of a bitch!

I got this.
Let her go.
There's your heart, Gideon.
Now let's save you.

But why would you stop him?
Now, remember what mother said.
"With the death of the savior, you can have it all."
You're nothing but a devil on my shoulder.
Doesn't mean to say I'm wrong, dearie.
This is our last chance to finally get everything.
Love and power.
All you have to do now is put the heart down and let our boy finish his mission.
No.
I won't betray my family.
I will do the right thing.
I was destined to become the savior.
And now you're fated to change magic!
In this new world, we will make the rules.
Belle wants to see the world.
Well, go on.

No.
It won't...

Gideon, stop.
Do not kill Emma swan.
Did you really think it was gonna be that easy?
This is the black fairy's spell we're talking about here!
You may want to do the right thing, but as we all know, we can't always get what we want.
Now, can we?
No one's going to save you.
No one needs to save me!

I'm fighting for the people I love.
Ultimately, I am a hero.
I am hope.

And light cannot destroy darkness.
It can only create more light.
I will not kill innocents!
I will do what all saviors must!
I will give hope... no matter what the cost.
No!
I'm sorry, Emma.
I was hoping you'd save us both.
Nnghh!
I failed you, belle.
I failed our family.
I made the right choice.
It just didn't work out.
Hey.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I love you, too!
Is that...
It's Gideon.
A fresh start.
A happy ending.
No.
A happy beginning.
Henry!
I think this belongs to you.
"When good and evil both did the right thing, faith was restored.
The final battle was won."
That's it.
That's all?

No.
'Course not.

I mean, maybe of this book, but...

So...

Now?

Believing in even the possibility of a happy ending is a powerful thing, but living with that kind of belief...
That's the most powerful thing of all.
That's hope.
So you asked, "what now?"
Now we get to keep going on.
We get to keep doing what we love...
With the people we love.
An ending isn't happiness.
Being together is.
Ready for a new adventure?
Hello?
Hi.

Yeah.
Yeah.

My name's Lucy.

I don't have a daughter.
Yeah, you do.
Now come on.
