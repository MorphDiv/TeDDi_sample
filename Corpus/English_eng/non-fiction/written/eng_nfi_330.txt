Are you ready?
I can't do it for you.
I had a dream about you.
- What happened?

- Alvey doesn't need this fight.

- Should we come down on the number?

Pony the fuck up.
It's a million fuckin' dollars.
Why are you being so mean?
Because I don't need your unsatisfied, depressing shit.
Open the fuckin' door, Kayla.
She can hardly walk.
Let's do a third fight.

Make money with the gift that God gave you.
I am Sid fuckin' Vicious.
Get the fuck off me.
Priest:

And of the Holy Spirit.
Thank you.
It's buzzing.
Oh, shit.
Shh.
Sorry.
You answer that phone, you're going straight to hell.
Come sit down...
For a sec.
When's the last time you were in a church?
Besides a meeting?
When the boys were little and we went on that church kick.
Oh, yeah.
We were gonna show them the way.
Mm.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Just banged up.

Oh, god damn it.
Hey, would you stop?
I got to go.
Are you going to Jay's for dinner tonight?
Wasn't asked.
You better go, grandma.
What's wrong?
Well, use another room.
You girls are driving me crazy.
Too bad Mac wasn't there.
Yeah, he was on call.
I just got a text from Dan and I got to go show a house.
Right now?
Yeah.
Even with your face like that?
Who punches a friend in the face?
I hit him first.
Crazy isn't cute.
It's not?
Not when you have a daughter.
Hmm.

You were wasted and you drove.
- You can't do that.

- You always say that.

I was kidding.
I fuckin' woke up this morning, I felt like shit.
It's never gonna happen again.
What house are you showing?
Um...
It's a pocket listing in Mar Vista, I think?
What time is your mom coming?
I told her six.
Can you pick this stuff up from the store on your way home for dinner?
You got it, boss.
I won't let you down.
You really want to impress me?
Go sell that fucking house.
Dantzler:

No note?

No.
He got a phone?
He left it in his room.
That's not good.
What do you mean?
A lot of times, uh, suicides leave important shit behind.
Phones, wallets...
They don't need'm anymore.
Yeah, I am... kinda worried.
He's been really depressed.
I bet he has.
Jesus Godamighty, can you imagine?
But, hey.

He just went off the grid.
I mean, a lot of times I go to the pool,
I leave the phone in the car, you know?
It's good to unplug.
But on a positive note, uh, you're looking well.
You got a suit on.

You fitting in okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
Good.

Uh, me, I'm...
I'm actually retiring.
Good for you.
Well, I had to.
I got a white-hot case of shingles.
Felt like a goddamn harpoon going through my chest.
Still got marks on my side.
Fucking wake-up call.
Gotta slow down.
Yeah.
You see, uh, Keith, you tell'm we're looking for him.

Yeah.
Nice to see you picking up the pieces, Ryan.
You stay the course, huh?
Alvey:

- Come on!

- Let's go!

Good.

You good?
Keep working.
Keep working.
Dan:

That was your mistake.
You gave up your back.
At some point, you... you got...

Dan, I am so sorry...
Jay...
You're fired.
I...
Dude, I gave you chances, okay.
I don't know hat world you think you're living in, but this is civilization and you act like a fucking monkey.
You did more dumb shit in one night than most people do in their career.
I've never seen anything like it.
All right, I have a philosophy when I...
When I hire an agent, okay?
I don't give a shit about experience.
Any retard can learn real estate.
I want a dynamic personality, and guess what?
You got that, man.

But you also have a fucking screw loose.
Seriously.

You don't want to thrive, man.
What do I do?

I can't work with that.
Do you have anything you want to say to me?
Thank you for the opportunity.
I really appreciate it.
And I'm sorry it didn't work out.
All right.

Good luck out there, man.

Yeah?
You in the middle of something?
No, come in.
That was nice, this morning.
It was.
You okay?
Yeah, uh, we should talk about Nate.
Yeah.

Garo's dragging his feet about putting him on his next card.
Why?
I don't know.

He's just kind of not responding.
Fuck'm, put him on another promotion.
He needs a fight.

I agree.
And Ryan?

Uh, Garo wants to put him on your card.
Co-main event.
Not gonna happen.
You'll be fighting last.
No.

Your name will be bigger.

No.

What is the fucking problem?
I'm doing one fucking fight.

I mean, all the cards in the world...
He's got to be on my fucking card?

It's not Ryan.

This is a big event.
He is paying you a million dollars.
Do you really want to make a big deal out of this?
I'm not doing a co-main event.

It's not what I signed up for.
He can be on the card, but he can't be co-main.
Okay.

Hey.

What is it?
Whey.

Super fucking clean.
There's vanilla.

Not bad.
Nice, right?

Huh-uh.
Hey.

Thanks.
Watching you and Alvey today.
Mm.
You guys have been working together for a while, right?
Long time.
Yeah.
I kind of...
Kind of noticed something.
If I may.
By all means.
When you jab, you leave that front leg wide open.
No, I'm angled away.

Not if he steps over the left foot.
Right?
Hey, Alvey.
Alvey:

I got a class.

Hey, Lisa tell you I'm on the card?
Yeah, she did.
You're cool with that, right?
We'll figure out.

Yeah.
You don't clean up after yourself?
I just used it.
Wash your fucking dishes, man.

There's other people here.
Can I get another one of these?
Lisa:

Jay took some of it, but a lot of it's boy stuff, so...
Oh.

No problem.
So, how's Mac?

Mm.

Are you guys getting married?
No.
It's more like just friends.
He really wants to be involved.
Ah, good.
He's a good one.
Mm.

Uh, take whatever you want.

Okay.
I've been in a really...
I've been in a shitty mood lately, too.
Everything pisses me off.
Dr. Kramer:

I also got this pain running down both my arms, my hands are numb, my back.
Fucking with my sleep.
Were you injured?
No.
Not that kind of pain.

It's like...

Have you seen a doctor?
Mnh-mnh.

I wanted to talk to you about it, you know?
Since I'm coming off the medication that, you know, maybe it's causing some kind of misfire, you know?
Nerve-wise.
Possible.
I mean, I've never seen it.
I would really like you to go see a doctor to rule out anything structural or neurological.
See, this is what I'm talking about.

I...
I have been hit in the head a lot.
You mean CTE?
Parkinson's,
CTE, all of it.
Is that common among MMA fighters?
You know, it's common among fighters, period.
You get hit in the head.

I mean, I don't know.
What does it even fucking matter?
First tremor, I'm putting a bullet in my head.
When's the pain the worst?
The morning.
And at night.
Times when you're typically alone?
It's all I can fucking think about.
'Sup, brother?
You done for the day?
Alvey's got an appointment.
Shit, I can hold some pads for you.
Want to get some extra work in?
No, man, you're leaving.

Bro, where the fuck am I going?

You sure you don't mind?
Get your ass in there, come on.
Get some work in.
You know what the worst mistake in hu... in human history was?
You know what the worst mistake in human history was?
Anyone?
It's...

The worst mistake in human history was...
Agricultural revolution.
Once we learned how to plant crops, we effectively enslaved ourselves.
We used to be nomads.

I'm hungry, I'm gonna grab a fig out of the tree.
A turnip out of the ground.
Take a nap.

Now you just... it's all work.
I mean, that's all you do is work, you know?
You c... you c... you clear the fields, you till the soil, you plant the seed, you water it, you harvest it, you put it into a silo.
And even when you have enough, it's like all you want is more.
And this has made us violent, and... and bloodthirsty, 'cause we don't roam.
We just...

And we acquire possessions, and we shit out babies, and we get real territorial.
No, I'm not gonna walk away.
No, I'm gonna fight to the fucking death!
That's what we do now.
Because...
You know, because we don't roam anymore.
And we don't know there's a big fucking fig tree, a sweet, ripe, plump fig tree right over the hill.
We're all just... slaves to...
Wheat, and corn, and potatoes, and famine, and bloodshed...
We're not what we were meant to be.
Agricultural revolution.
Anyway, I'm gonna go to the...

So, I wish everybody here a wonderful afternoon.
Don't work too hard.
Nice.

Nice!

All right.
Loose, loose, loose.
When you come in, jab step, right hand.

You got it.
Hey.
Yeah?
First, you coming in with the jab, right?
Yeah.
Fake the takedown, come with that power.
I strike to the takedown.

I understand, I understand.

Won me a lot of fights.
Listen to me.
You got KO power in your hands, right?
I feel it.

I see it when you're hitting mitts with Alvey.

He flinches every time you let one go.
You got dynamite in your fucking fist.
Fucking use it.
Let it go.
Lisa:

- What are you doing?

Alvey doesn't want you to coach Ryan.
That's not why you're here.
He asked for my help.

Dom!

Let's work!
I got to go.
Hey!
You fucking cunt.
Dom!
My office.

There's Vaseline in the lounge.
I'll bite down on my pad.
Hey, coach.
Shut the door.
I thought I made myself clear about Ryan.
You absolutely did.
The fuck you doing in the cage with him?
Oh, he just wanted to get work in, that's it.
He got his work in before I left, Dom.
I...
I was literally holding pads.

I'm not gonna deal with this bullshit!
You understand?

You get a warning today.
Nate and Ryan need one fucking voice in their head.
You understand?

You start contradicting the shit I say, you confuse my fighter.
You confuse my fighter, we got a problem.
Are we clear?
Yes.

I apologize.
You do it again, you're out.
I understand, and I apologize.
I apologize.
You're just...

I'm enjoying myself.
I mean, you set up a great culture here, you know?
All right.

Just get the fuck out of my office.
Ooh, he's cute.
And British, which is awesome.
He's a US citizen now.
Yeah, but he's got that accent.
I'm a sucker for a British accent.
Or Australian.

But you... you...

Everything they say will sound like a royal decree.
It makes you feel too stupid to talk.
He's not like that.

It's kind of, like, a rough area.
Well, good.

I don't.
Are you sure you want to be in a relationship?
Why wouldn't I?
Aww.

I mean, you might not even know what kind of guy you like.
Maybe you need to go through a couple of them before you settle down.
I'm not settled down.
It sounds like you are.
Nate, he gave you a key.
Dad doesn't even know yet.
Is Will pushing you to come out?
No.

Well then, it's none of your dad's business until you're ready.
It's your life.
Amy:

Not yet.

Yeah, it says his phone is disconnected.
Will you try him?
Yeah.
Hey, Lisa.
How'd your little chat go?
Shh.
Can't say I didn't warn you.
So, your... your top fighter asked me to train.
What am I supposed to do?
You're not supposed to train him.
He asked me.
And then he played you against Alvey and got Alvey's attention.
I fucking hate politics.

Then don't be fucking political.
How do I fix this?
Uh, leave it alone.
He'll forget about you in a couple of days.
How do I fix it with you?
We're good.
You want to have a drink with me?
Oh, my God.

Are you kidding me?

I mean, I got to fucking write a list of all the things I can't do.
Don't train Ryan, don't drink with Lisa...
Don't be a smartass.
I feel like a dumb-ass.
I feel like a dumb-ass after today.
Have a drink with me.
Come on.
She go down okay?
Yeah.

You need a glass of wine.
Are your parents still together?
Sorry, what?
Are your parents still married?
- Yeah.

Umm... 42 years I think.
That's amazing.
I bet your mom is beautiful.
Oh.

Do you want me to try?
No, it's okay.

Sorry.
Hi.
Where the fuck have you been?
At work.
You're three hours late.
Yeah.

Why is your phone disconnected?
Uh, my phone was stolen at the bar, so Dan had to disconnect it.
For security reasons.
Because it's a company phone, but fear not.
I took it upon myself to upgrade dinner.
Steaks.
$30 a pop!
And...
Hmm.
A bottle of French wine... highly rated in the low 90s with hints of wet leather, soil, and currants.
Look at me.
Mm?
You're fucking high.

It's...

Why?
Drumroll, please.
Because I... sold a house today.
That's great.
That is great.
Hm?
Thank you.
It's just an offer, but it is above asking, which is exactly what we were looking for.
So, I'm gonna get cleaned up, make myself appropriate, use the facilities, and then we can get cooking.
What do you say?

Hmm?
Starving.
Just a minute.
- Open the door.

Christina:

You're blowing it.
What are you on?
You on coke?
Let me see your pockets.
Get out of my house.
You're scaring her.
This is not your home.
Please leave.
No.
I want you to leave.
Mnh.
Okay.
Yep, I'm here.
Yeah, it's in Venice.
Cash.
Enzo.
No, it's not a problem.
I don't have a preference.
That's fine.
Natural?
Mm-hmm.
Sure.
Uh, ten o'clock, latest.
Can't do any later.
Yeah?
That's great.

How are the steaks?
How's your steak?
It's good.
Hm?

Look.

Goddamn thing of beauty.
It's not too done, is it?
- Nope.

I take mine rare.
Knock off the horns and wipe the ass.
Is that a... baby crying?
Am I wrong?

Is that a baby crying?
Are you... are you gonna pick her up?
When I'm finished.
Well, then, I'll pick her up.
No, you won't pick her up.
Rowr!
Tiger mom.
We could've used one of those, huh, Nathaniel?
If we're not gonna do anything, then maybe we just kill the fucking monitor.
You want me to turn this baby monitor off?
Well, if it just doesn't matter that she's crying, then I don't know why we have to fucking listen to it.
Do you have any idea how fucking gross you are right now?

Drunk and high like a fucking loser.
You have a daughter, Jay!
I know that because of the fucking crying that I hear for her mother.
I am disgusted by you.
I'm a monster, right?
Mm.
Fuck you, Amy.
Yeah.
Do better.
Jay, shut the fuck up.
Nate, she's bringing up an issue, but it's not the real issue.
The real issue, right, is class.
You can't let this go!
No, no, 'cause we are white fucking trash, and she can't believe that she got stuck with us.
And a baby, no less.
You see this?
Mmm!
$30 steak.
Means shit to me.
Means shit to me 'cause I am who I am.
And I'll eat scraps out of a fucking gutter.
I'll dig a fucking ditch.
I'm out.

Whoa, we're done?
Yeah.

It's early.

Home.
To do what?
Uh, to do whatever the fuck it is I want to.
- Hey.

Hey, hey, hey.

Before you go...

Sir?
Sir, can we get two shots of añejo?
No, no, I'm good.
The good shit up top?
Come on.
Before you go, before you go...
You want to play a game of chance?
What's the game?
What's the game?
You sure you want to know my game?
Oh, you don't even have one.
No, I do.
Don't be scared.
But, I got to...

Now, see, are you gonna be honest with me?
I don't know.

I can trust you.
You got an honest face.
Get on with the fucking game.
Okay, okay.
I have to guess three things that you're gonna do when you get home tonight.
Now, if I'm wrong...

I take both shots.
Now, if I'm right, you take a shot with me
and we keep on drinking.
How many guesses?
Shit, I'm gonna go three for three.
Cocky.
I'm not cocky.

- You ready?

- You sure?

Okay.
In no particular order...
Okay.
Number one...
When you get home, you're gonna pour yourself a glass of wine.
I'm also going to brush my teeth and go to sleep.
Those are easy ones.

I'm warming up.
I'm on my move...

- Okay.

Number two.

Tch-tch-tch-tch-tch tch-tch-tch-tch.
Don't slap me.
I can't promise anything.
You may get a little upset.
When you go home, you're gonna get yourself off.
You have no fucking class at all.
Was I wrong?
What, that's...
- Oh, my bad.

Thank you.
Number three.
When you go home,
you're gonna cry about some shit that's not even your fault.
Who'd you talk to?
A few people told me.
They... they love you.
It wasn't gossip.
Can we have two more shots?
- Hey.

Yeah.

Drink?
Ah, I don't drink.
Oh.
They told you everything?
They did, indeed.
Thanks.
Okay.
So...
Where do you want me?
The bed?
The bed.
♪ Now that we are together ♪
♪ Baby, you and me ♪
♪ My life is so complete now ♪
♪ Since you fell in love with me ♪
♪ Since you fell in love with me ♪
You on the pill?
What?
Are you on the pill?
Yeah.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

- Oh, fuck.

Oh, fuck.
Shit.
Where you going?
Shit.
You're fucking wild, man.
Dom?
'Sup?
I'll see you tomorrow.
Wow.

Are you serious?
I think you had a pretty fucking good time tonight.
All right.
You drive safe, all right?
Yep.
I got fired today.
Why?
Uh...
Numerous offenses.
You told Amy you sold a house.
Yeah, I did that so that she wouldn't get mad at me when I came home all fucked up.
You gotta combine a positive with a negative.
Like, I'm wasted, but I'm celebrating.
Sweet and sour.
Sugar and poison.
There are the fundamental building blocks of a healthy relationship.
You can try it on Will.
You can call me and say thank you.
She's trying with you.
I know, but, it...
It's, like, hard.
She's got... one foot out the door.
I'm just giving her, you know, a little push.
It's not a joke.
You gonna lose them.
Maybe it's better.
Yeah, I mean, she can bring Maya to Wisconsin.
She's got a really good family.
Her dad is a, um...
He's an actuary which is, like, a, um...
It's like the elite form of accounting 'cause they have money put on their back in order to predict the future.
It's... it's a better life.
That is so fucking weak.
I'm a very weak man.
I thought you wanted a family.
I want for nothing.
I just...

Can I ask you something?
Yeah.
When you were getting fucking shit-faced today, and you got fired from your fucking job... acting like an asshole at dinner, did you think for one second about your fucking daughter?
I mean, do you want to be a part of Maya's life or not?
I accept what comes my way.
Well...
I don't respect that.
Oh, Nathaniel, you have so much to learn, man.
You have so much to fucking learn.
Oh, yeah.
Again?
I must be on your mind.
How was dinner with the boys?
Disaster.
What happened?
Jay disappeared, and then he came home high.
Ah, fuck, really?
Fucking kid loves chaos.
Yeah, I wonder where he gets that from.
Mnh.

No, that would be you.
Me?

Where do you even live?
I live in your dreams.
That's right.
You do.
There anything else about that dream you want to tell me?
Like what?
Like... did we fuck?
Did we fuck?
You really wanna know?
Well, I'm curious.
No.
You gave me too much heroin.

You must be getting old.
What are you wearing?
Keith?
Keith?
Keith?
Hey, man, where have you been, dude?
I thought you fucking killed yourself, dude.
Dude.
What the fuck happened to you?
Are the police looking for me?
Yeah.

I fell down the side of the highway.
We gotta get you to a hospital.
Mm, no.
Yeah, dude.

No.
Keith.
Keith, you're fucking bleeding, man.
I am bleeding, but can we go in the morning?
I'd just like to spend one more night here.
Please?
Please, Ryan, and then...

You can... can have this whole place to yourself.
Keith.
I don't want this place.
Why not?
I don't know what you're talking about, man.
What?
What?
Come on, man.
Nobody wants...
What?
Nobody wants to live here.
Let's, uh...
I don't want you to look at me.
Come on, man.

Hey.
Why you crying, man?
I don't want you to look at me.
Why you crying?
No, hey.

I got you.
Keith.
Buddy.
I got you, buddy.

It's all good, man.

Come here.

- Shh.

It's okay.

Hey, I got you, man.
I got you, buddy, okay?
Shh.
You wanna stop somewhere to eat?
Get a burger?
Keith, they're not gonna put you to sleep, dude.
Probably just gonna extend your probation for cutting off the monitor.
I'm not coming back, Ryan.
Sure you are, dude.
We'll get you sorted out with the police.
We'll get you under a doctor's care.
You'll be back before you know it, okay?
Turn right up here.
What?
Ryan, just turn right.
- Why?

Okay, all right.

Keep going.
Okay, you're gonna stop here.
Where?
Just stop here.

- Up here.

Yeah.
Okay.
Right here?
What're we doing?
I have to show you something.
Okay.

- Follow me.

Keith?
Keith, what are we doing, bud?
Keith.
Is this...

Keith, come on, man.
What?

Lift it up.
Lift it up!
Oh, fuck!
Oh!
Ga...
Keith, what did you do, dude?
Whoa.
Fuck!
