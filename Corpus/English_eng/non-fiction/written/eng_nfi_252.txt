["Mmmbop" Continues Playing]
[Naomi] So, now on to final business.
- Anyone?

Yeah, the book that Ethan Turner and I have been working on is ready for prime time.
- We just broke it wide open...

I am so sorry to interrupt.
Good morning, Patel.
I love your beret.
Thanks.

They are bidding mid-seven figures for Patty Ho's Wolf Trials series!
Oh, God, that's awesome!
[All Howl]
I don't know what we're doing.

Get your hands out of my face, Patel!

That's my book, Wolf Trials.
The book Ethan Turner and I were working on, Wolf Trials.
What are you talking about?
Wolf Trials!

- Are you joking?

Are you joking?
Are you joking?

Max, Wolf Trials has been in the works for at least a year.
I got it.
I'm getting punked.

No one's punking anyone.
I mean, we discuss it at every single meeting.
You even contributed some ideas.
No one has ever thought to put a wolf on trial.
[Naomi] And what do you think, Max?
I think it should end with a... with a courtroom scene.
I think you might be a little distracted on the personal front.
I punked you guys.
I punked you, that was a... the reverse punk, so...
I pulled a switch on you.
I reversed it.
A lot of people find their 40th birthday challenging.
- Please don't try to make this about that.

Why don't you tell me?

Your 40th birthday.
Well, there's some circular reasoning for you.
I have no fear of getting older.
It's just that all the choices disappear.
Everything's been decided for me.
I mean, I'm just locked into my life.
Who I'm married to, who my children are, what I do for a living, it's all done, all the doors are closed.
There's only one door I haven't walked through and I'm not eager to.
So you feel trapped?
What?

I love my life.
I just sometimes wonder what would happen if it was blown to smithereens and I got to start all over again.
Is that crazy?
People blow up their lives all the time.
Right.

I'm not gonna wake up one morning and find out that Ethan is single, for example.
That's not the main thing I'm thinking about.
You bring that up in every session.
Well someone's keeping score.
I'm just observing a pattern.
And I'm observing a pattern, too.
Of hostile score keeping.

[Ethan Squeals]

[Ethan Squeals]
[Cell Phone Rings]
[Nick Groans]
[Nick] Hold on one second.
Hello.
Hey.
[In Caribbean Accent] Welcome home, man!
I'm still on the plane.
I'm gonna call Ethan.
He's right here, man.

No, I don't want to do that.
I don't want him to even know that this is me.
Can you take a few steps away from him?
Alright.
You look so hot in those goggles, bro.
I just wanted to let you know that I am gonna tell Ethan what happened.
Unless you already have.
No.

There was nothing serious about it.

Just one person fucking the other person's dick off for eight hours.
We're not gonna get back into this.

- Nick, look.

Nick, look.
[Groans]
I need to tell Ethan.

Don't fucking say anything, okay?
I've done this before and nothing good comes from it.
I can't live with this anymore, I can't.
I feel like I'm gonna throw up all the time.
Please don't, okay?
Please don't say anything.

I don't think we're going to that.

- Nick, look...

Bye.
[Nick Laughs]
[Nick] What?
I'm gonna give return balls like that.

You don't even understand.
[Ethan] Ready for some service?
[Cell Phone Rings]
I'm gonna...
- I'm just gonna grab some water, I think

- I'm feeling...

Okay.

You are super in the way.
There we go.
[In Caribbean Accent] Yo, man!

Are you gonna be home when I get there?
Yeah, man, I'm planning on being home there and that you and I are gonna go to the party together.
Yeah, listen...
We need to talk before we go to Sam's.
We need to talk.
- What about?

Are you okay?

No...
- You know, we'll talk soon.

We can...

We'll talk later, okay?
Okay, bye.
- You good?

I'm good.
[Sam] The gala, I am not looking forward to it.
- Hey, Sam.

Can I just have her for just a second?

I'm so sorry.

- What are you doing here?

What?

She just called me from the runway and said we need to talk in person.
Nothing good ever happens when a wife says that.
Listen, I am going to tell Lisa everything.
- No.

- No, you are not.

- Yes, I am, Sam.

Stop!

I'm going to tell her.

This is a decision that we make together and I forbid you from talking about it.
There's nothing to say, anyway.

I know that.
You don't get to blow up my marriage and my children's lives to alleviate your conscience.
If it helps, I will tell her I had the affair with someone else.
Please!

No, she won't.
Listen.
I wish it were as easy as telling Lisa and moving on, but it isn't.
It will change your marriage irrevocably and mine, too.
Obviously, but believe me, I've given this a lot of thought.
It's over.
We're done.
That's what matters.
Please don't ruin my life.
Please.
Listen to me.

Mommy!
- Hey!

Hello, my loves!
- Hello!

Are you coming to karate with us?
Are you talking about...
[Makes High-Pitched Noises]
I'm sorry, I can't guys.

Let's go.

- Bye-bye.

[Sam] We'll give those ones to the squirrels.
[Pilot] Hi, folks.

A storm system is over the Chesapeake, so we have to wait it out.
Shouldn't be much more than a half hour.
So we're gonna keep you here on the plane.
[Passengers Groan]
Okay, stop.

[Pilot] Hello again from the flight deck.
That storm system is lingering a bit.
But it shouldn't be more than an hour.
[Passengers Groan Louder]
We're gonna hand out complimentary champagne to thank you for your patience.
[Cheering]
Hello, folks, me again.
Traffic patterns are backed up all over, so we may be diverted to Newark.
We'll have more information in an hour.
I don't wanna go to this party.
What?

I just...

You know what I was thinking?

- What?

Your next book after Wolf Trials.
Centaurs, half man, half horse.
Super buff, long hair, great posture, kind of forest dwelling.
- It would be super cool.

You could just replace the word "werewolf" for "centaur" in the document.
Maybe we should see how Wolf Trials does first.
Yeah, although, you know, never too soon to get on that next idea or even replace the current idea with the new one.
Max, I'm sorry, I just...
I just finished a 400-page draft so I'm a little fucking tapped out right now.
You wrote 400 pages?
- Yeah, it's a fucking book.

Are you mad?

I just wanna fucking go home and see Lisa.
- That's all I wanna fucking do.

Can we just get on the train, please?
Haha!

I want to cancel the party.
I don't want to celebrate getting old!
Come on, it's gonna be terrific!
It's too complicated.
Why can't we just go out to dinner?
You do that all the time.

- That's what you do when you turn 40.

I wish you'd told me that six months ago.
I did.
Oh.
Come on, it's gonna be great.
You're gorgeous.
Can you...
I wonder if there's time for me to take a nap.
Does it ever creep you out living in this house?
No, because I have nothing to hide.
It did creep me out a little bit when that bear threw the chair through the window.
That means that he was inside the house and wanted to get the hell out.
Whenever you see me zoning out, I'm thinking about that bear running around inside our house.
Creepy.
Doesn't make sense.
- A bear doesn't have opposable thumbs.

- Do you know where Pearl and Marianne are?

Where?
Now hit the brake.
- Which one is the brake?

Now put it in park.
- Nice job.

You bet.
[Sam] Hi.
Thank you so much for coming.
Hello!
- I'm old.

I've got your membership papers.
- You look great.

Hi, welcome to our shindig.

- Thanks for having us.

What else is impress?

- This is just...

Oh, God, look, there's Lisa.
Yay!
- Hey, you.

Oh, my God.

[Lisa] I sprained it.
[Ethan] You got some color.
- There was a lot of...

- Hi!

Don't worry about little old me.

- Thank you.

Can I use your restroom just to wash my face and just kind of clean up?
- I feel disgusting.

I'll take her.
This is not what I thought I'd wear to your 40th but this is what I'm wearing.
Great.

It's just... in there.
Hand towel's on the bottom.
Yeah.

Can I have a minute to talk to my wife?

- What's your plan?

Before she brings it up first, okay?
Did you see how she just greeted me?
- She definitely knows.

- She knows.

- Hi.

I need to talk to you.
- Yeah.

You know what?

- Yeah.

- [Whispers] Fuck you.

- [Nick] Hey, buddy.

Wow.

Look, I haven't had a second to talk to Ethan yet.
- So just...

I've been wanting to tell him everything to his face.
Stop it, this isn't funny, okay?
I'm not gonna be able to talk to him until we leave so let that inform your behavior.
Fine.

Lisa, I want to introduce you to my fiancée, Dustry.
- Hi.

- Wow.

- Lisa, look.

- Lisa, look.

I, like, still can't even believe it.

[Makes A Bleating Noise]
Like...
[Bleats]
- Yeah.

What is that?
This is my fiancée, Dustry.
We're engaged to be married.
- Well, congratulations.

[Bleats]
Just like...
[Bleats]
- Like...

- Bear, you're so cute!

I want to show you these bouquets.
What for?
For our wedding.
Oh, yeah.
- What is going on with those two?

How were the Caymans?
Terrible.
Yeah.
[Whispers] You're right.

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your coats and come on outside for a special presentation.
As you all know, my wife, Samantha, loves a good surprise.
Oh, no.

Which is why your friends and I have organized a very special...
[Dash And Pearl] Night of surprises!
[Guests Gasp]
I helped with the sign!
It's beautiful, I love it.
For my first surprise, and don't worry, honey, because I've got a few, let me introduce Nils Michelson.
Come over here, everybody, gather round over here.
[Dramatic Fanfare Music]
[Jon] Right over here.
Can anyone tell me what the most dangerous weapon in the world is?
- [Ethan] Machine gun?

- No.

- That's good.

- It's a bow and arrow.

That's not right.

[Nils] Now we all know it's bow and arrow, let's start the show.
[Dramatic Music Plays]
[Guests Cheer]
[Max] Wow, look at that!
[Guests Applaud]
Alright, for my next surprise, let's all go into the dining room.
- [Ethan] That's us.

- [Ethan] Friend group, let's go.

So let's just run lines one more time from the top.
- I'm good, I'll just read it.

- We said we're gonna do this off book.

Of course we want to do this!

- That's right.

Sorry!
This is one of the surprises in the Night of Surprises.
We gotta do it or else it's just a night.
In my experience, a performance has to answer two fundamental questions.
- Why here, why now?

I think Marianne's right.
This is a very elegant party.

Agreed.
[As Bill Clinton] I think it's gonna be a lot of fun for everybody involved.
I don't want to play Linda Tripp.

I never get to play the good characters.
Come on, the play is not terrible.

- The play's really good.

It seems irrelevant and depressing, given the way things turned out.
Well, I think it's a great opportunity for people to relive my legacy.
[As Donald Trump] I've gotta tell you, Bill, I think it's a bad idea.
It does not paint you in a good light.
And I wanna say that both of you were stupid, your wife and your daughter together, equal a six, okay?
She's a three, she's a two, they're a six.
[As Clinton] That's faulty math.
- Stop it!

- Stop!

Guys, listen.

Okay?
The students complained because the laughter was so loud nobody could study.
Do you remember that?

That's what we gotta get back to.

I don't know, the second you said students, it reminded me it was 20 years ago.
Maybe it doesn't hold up.
Max, the play sucks.
You suck, Marianne!
- You know what else sucks?

That stupid gender-bending Streetcar Named Desire play.
That was a disaster.
I'm sorry, that...
I didn't mean that.

I get carried away when I put on the wig and I become Kenneth Starr and I just attack without provocation or evidence.
I get a little... "Monica-rena".
["Macarena" Plays]
- Do you hear the "Monica-rena"?

That's the show!

We gotta finish the show.
And people are gonna love it, okay?

- I don't want to do this.

I look like a Hasidic Garth.
Good evening.
I am Kenneth Starr and I request your attention.
Guys, hands on hips.
Turn off the music.
- I thought you wanted me to...

Turn off the music.
Okay.

Hey, um...

You've gotta think it through.

Shut the fuck up.

It was shit and this is shit.
♪Happy birthday to you ♪
♪Happy birthday to you ♪
No.

Hold on.

We haven't...

Sorry, my bad, I guess.
- I guess we should eat...

- And then we'll...

What's happening?
Forget it, we're not doing it.

Well, that was great!
Thank you guys so much!
Hey, everybody, let's eat.
- Happy birthday, Sam.

- That was a rollercoaster.

- Hi.

- [Angrily] Ethan!

- Hi.

What's up?
Anastasia.
I didn't know she was invited tonight.
She wasn't.

Okay.
This is my rabbit.
Not the imposter one that you tried to pass off on me, whom I love now, too.
I don't know what this is.

Sam, get over here now.
You were supposed to take her to the vet, yet she ended up here, 50 miles away in Connecticut, in Sam's house, which means you two are still having an affair.
Hang on, how does she know about us?
Sam, when you told me that it was over, I believed you.

How long have you known about us?
Why do you care about this so much?

Why do I care so much?

You're my family.
No!

Oh, my God, Sam, you know what I mean.
She knows everything?

I am a human being.

Okay, I have to tell Lisa, okay?
She already knows, and apparently everybody else does too, and it'll make it better if I get to her first.
- You can't.

- Thank you, Marianne.

Please, Ethan, please don't, it's my birthday.
I'm gonna take Anastasia to the bedroom where she will eat most of your shoes.
Hey, is everything okay?
So many secrets.

- Lisa.

- Can we go for just a second, have a word.

A toast.
To my wonderful husband, Jon.
We're so lucky to have so much.
Let's all reflect for a moment on our good fortune, which is so rare and so precarious in this world.
Cheers.
[All] Cheers.
Perfect.
Okay, so I have one last surprise.
Hello, my beautiful friends.
I am Ken Yurubi.

Like the TV show?
Well, actually, The Mentalist was based on me.
Man, you must be loaded!
I, no...
No, they didn't...
Forget it.

I am here to tell you all what's in your minds.
Ken did a corporate retreat for us a few months ago and what he can do, it's just astounding.
No, no.
Okay.
Now, folks, I have been watching you at this little party all night.
[Guests Groan]
And I just can't wait to get inside your heads!
Okay.

[Hums A Tune]
Excuse me, True Blood.
Okay.
- Hi.

How are you?

- Hi, Ken.

You don't tell me who you are.

Wait.

In the night sky.
Star for Stella.

- I was in Streetcar!

That was my line!
You led him to it.

- This isn't real.

- I see a man.

[Max] Holy shit.
Guys, nothing is happening.
No, Max, nothing's happening right now.
How does he know everything about Tag?
Did you play the violin as a child?
Yes, I did!
[Guests Gasp]
You're gay.
[Tentative Applause]
It's a... great accomplishment of mine.
I see a man...
[Makes "F" Sound]
- Felix!

- Felix?

- Felix, yeah.

But Felix isn't, he's not here.
No, and that's sad.
You feel...

No.

Yeah, fine.

Come to The Mentalist.
No, I think she needs a hug.
There we go.
She gets a hug.
- Good.

- Okay.

Can I tell you something about you?

[Guests Laugh]
Yeah, that's my fiancée.
Not with her.
[Guests] Ooh!
Okay, this is not real, so don't worry.
- Tell her it's not real, please.

- Tell her it's not real.

We're all flesh and blood right here.
It's totally fake.
- Okay, no, it's totally real.

No, it's real.

Now...
[Ethan Whispers] I did not wanna do this.

And just because of that, I'm going to you now.
- Don't you think he should be next, folks?

[In Goofy Voice] No.

I think someone is nervous because of the secret.
[Sam Gasps]
Oh!
[Ken] Ah!
He!
I had sex with Nick.
[Guests Gasp]
Oh, my God!
- No.

When?
- Last week in the Caymans.

No.
I...

Dustry.
This is what happened at the retreat.
Ken just breaks everyone down.

So then why would you bring him to my birthday party?
Because I...
I told you I knew how to drive.
Can I try?
No.

[Pearl] Cake!

[Pearl And Dash] Cake, cake!
Cake!
Yeah!

Babe, I'm so sorry.
I love you so much.

I was out of my mind.
I think... after the wedding...
I got crazy and I got paranoid and I thought something was happening between you and Sam.
God, I don't know how you can ever forgive me, but I...
I really hope that you do.
I forgive you.
What?
I said I forgive you.
I love you and that's all that matters.
You...

Do you want me to be mad?
Would that make it better?
I think it would be better.
I don't think that I would do something like this unless I was trying to get a reaction from you.
Is Sam's car moving?
Sam's car's moving...

Sam?

- I don't have them.

What?

- Oh, my God.

I don't know where the keys are.

- They are in the car!

[Sam] We have to stop the car.
- Smash the glass!

We're not that important!
- I feel our friendship's in a weird place.

Hey, I should mention that someone in my department sold a book called Wolf Trials that I knew about but forgot existed.
[All Groan]
Ow!
- My hand!

This thing has broke my foot!
[Shrieks]
[Jon] No!
[Ethan] It's going in!
It's going in the pool.
Did you leave it in neutral?
Of course not.

Oh, no.
Why did you say, "Oh, no"?
In general.

I'm sorry about Wolf Trials.
Well, at least we still have your income, so...
Oh.

[Jon] Champagne?
Great.

Sam's car.

[All Laugh]
[Lisa] Oh, that's funny.
That's not it.
I think we should take a break.
[Jon] Oh, right.

That's your last surprise tonight, sweetie.
