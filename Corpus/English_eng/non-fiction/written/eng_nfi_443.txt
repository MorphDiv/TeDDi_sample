So we have to hook up with our people and find out where on Earth their bodies are being held.
And rescue them.

Ward.
Don't forget this.
You were the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
And now you're trapped in a virtual prison, and I am here to wake you up.
Put that away before we both get arrested.
Yes, I'd like to report a subversive.
A woman with a S.H.I.E.L.D. ID.
Really?
I want any and all assets in the area on this.
Ladies.
Is she your source in the Resistance?
Ward, I have nothing to do with the Resistance!
Well, I do.
Leopold.
These... subversives...
Apparently, they've got a mole inside Hydra.
Coulson... remember me.
You're the closest thing I have to family.
Daisy?
So, we're both from the "real world,"
we're S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, our bodies are being held captive, and this is all a virtual prison, built to keep us sedated.
Am I missing anything?
No, that's about the gist of it.
[ Chuckles ]
I knew I wasn't crazy.
Hydra lies about everything.
Take the Cambridge Incident.
It was a setup.
That girl shouldn't have been at that school in the first place.
Where we're from, she died.
This never happened.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Door opens ]
Hey, Mr. Coulson, my homework was done, I swear, but then my dad made me...
Amy, we've been over this.
Until first bell, this is my time.
It's okay.
Hydra used Cambridge to take control, in the name of law and order... to justify everything.
I knew if anyone would understand, it'd be you.
I would've figured it out a long time ago if it wasn't for the mind-control soap.
That blue soap everyone uses?
Hydra loads it up with chemicals.
It seeps into our bloodstream.
Implants false memories into our brains.
They want us to believe this is a magical place.
But don't worry, I'm clear.
I make my own soap now.
No, I think that you're talking about Project TAHITI.
Why don't we put the soap theories on hold just for one second, okay?

Something big's going down over here.

Face it... you're slowing down, Dad.
Oh, is that right?
[ Chuckles ]
Well, tell me, show-off, what'd you use for an electronic speed control?
Well, I sort of found something by school, in the park.
A Hydra drone?
Maybe I borrowed a part or two.
Hope, you know better.
We don't mess around with those guys.
No, no, we stay off Hydra's radar, we keep our heads down, and follow their rules, always.
I'm really, really sorry, Daddy.
[ Sighs ]
[ Sighs ]
Just want you to be more careful, all right?
[ Sighs ]
I tell you what.
I'll take the drone parts back later, and then you and I can try to get mine working together.

And here, he makes his own soap.
Ward warned us away, but we barely made it out.
[ Sarcastically ] Oh, thank goodness for Grant Ward.
I don't love it, either, but this is the second time he's helped us.
And so I hate to say this, but I think we can trust him.
Until we can't.
Betraying those closest to him is his signature move.
For now, we just need to get somewhere safe.
Ward set up a time and place for us to meet the Resistance.
It's a whole password-exchange thing.
I always wanted to do that.
Or, I've been thinking...
What if I reached out to Fitz?
If you were able to get through to Coulson, then surely I could get Fitz to remember me.
This reality may be upside down, but Fitz is still Fitz.
He's still a good person.
Who happens to be second in command at Hydra.
Yeah, which means he has resources, not to mention Framework expertise, which we'll need to get out of Radcliffe's Hydra snow globe.
Holden Radcliffe, the scientist?
I...
Here it is.
"Famed Hydra scientist working on Inhuman cure."
Something felt off about him.
But think about it.
Nobody's seen him since this photo was taken.
You guys meet up with Ward's contact.
I'll go back to the Triskelion and get a location on Radcliffe.
Daisy, it's too dangerous.
We've detained several Inhuman sympath...

Man, I dreamed about what your suit would look like.
I made a few sketches, but this is actually way cooler.
For about 70 years after World War II, nothing.
No one even knew it was here.
But then, a couple years back, a brave agent named Billy Koenig gave his life getting me the location.
It's taken all that time just to get it operational again.
Got to say, the whole Rebel Alliance aesthetic's really working for me.
I'll take that as a compliment.
I think?
This way, please.
The early days were tough.
A lot of good agents died for this.
