One, two, three!
Ha!
Fitness tracker, monitor my workout!
How's my health?
Ah, I'm doing great!
Wha!

Grizz, stop it ... get down!
I feel so motivated.

Hya!
East Bay train arriving.
Beep beep, coming through.
Oh!

Come on, Grizz, move!

Ah, guys, this fitness tracker's incredible!
Mm, I don't know, man.

The beeping...

Phew!

Ha, I can't believe you didn't get one, too, Panda.
No, I'm happy with my purchase.
This selfie stick is perfect!
I just had to get something for my precious cellie.
You guys want to test it out?
Oh, boy, we look terrible.
- It's really dark.

Mm, no...

Make sure my fitness tracker is in view.
- Oh.

Okay, what if ...

- How is Ice Bear's hair?

Oh, this will do!
Okay, pose.

Three, two...
No!
- Our train ... no!

Oh, man.
Next East Bay train in 40 minutes.
Ugh, 40 minutes?

Ice Bear should have brought a magazine.
Oh!

Whoa, ho ...

Oh, he wants that bagel so bad!
Go, go, go!

He's a legend!
Ooh, let's watch another Bagel Rat video!
I heard the first one happened here at this station!
Ugh, let's watch something new, instead.
Ice Bear wants to watch dancing babies.
- Hey, come on!

- Let me choose the videos.

Give it back, guys, give it back!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- No!

Do not cross the yellow area!
Help, police!
What ...

Oh, selfie stick...
Oh, it's not working!

O-Okay, don't freak, man.
We'll find something that can reach it.
Okay, maybe there's something in here that can help.
Ugh!

Maybe, uh...
Huh?

Where did it ... what?

Is that...

Oh!

Hey, man, that's not a bagel!
Uh, give it back!

Please, stop!
Wow, we're getting quite a workout.
Grizz, wait ...

Somebody, anybody, my phone is on the tracks!
Does anyone have anything long enough to reach it?
Help!
Hmm.
Do you have an idea?
Bagel Rat, please stop!

Huh?

"Do not enter"?

Huh?
Okay, be careful.

Steady, careful!
Almost ... ooh, oops.

It's too short.
A text message!
That's it!

- I need a ... you!

- Froyo guy!

- Please, let me borrow your phone!

Come on, come on!
Yes, it's working!

- What do I text?

All right.

You guys are gonna love these.
Keep texting, man, it's working!
Almost.

We got it!
Yeah!

Yeah, hang on, I got one more emoji.
Nooo!
Ow.
Wait!
Huh?
Uh, Bagel Rat!
Train arriving in 20 minutes.
What a bummer, man.
You just had to send another text, didn't you!
- Hey, man, lay off.

Ice Bear didn't want it to come to this.
Whoa!
Come here, Bagel Rat!
No, no, no!
Huh?
Whoa.

Whoa!

Ice Bear drone not technically legal.
A little more to the left.
You got to straighten it out!
Oh, bro, it's off-balance!

Holy crispies.

He's close.

Aha!

Nope.
Now, that's a nice tote bag.
Huh?

Can't squirm...

Gah!
Huh?

Bagel Rat!
There go my fit dreams.
Just a little more!
Oh, bro, it's off balance!
Ah!
Quick, grab it in now!
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
We got it!
Okay, okay, bring it in.

Huh?

What's was that sound?
That can't be our train.

Train on platform 2 now arriving.
It's the other train!

- Ice Bear's got this.

- Hands off Ice Bear.

You're too slow!
- Sorry about that.

Train arriving in 5 ...

Three minutes?

Oh, sweet, the train's coming early.
No, no, no, no, no!

Bros, my fitness tracker is gone forever.
Whoa.

Ice Bear lost a part of himself.
My phone, it's still stuck on the track.
Oh, man, today is not our lucky day.
Huh?

Hey!

What?

Maybe he can help grab it!

Come on, come on!

- Come here, little Bagel Rat.

Bagel Rat, bring us the phone, okay?
- Over here, over here!

Oh, it's too square for his taste!
Bagel Rat, come on, man!
Do this one for us!

Ice Bear has idea.
Whoa!
What are you ... huh?
- Oh, bro, you're a genius!

- Get the phone!

Whoo-hoo!

Train has arrived.
Run, run!
Run as fast as your little rat feet will take you!
- Get out of there!

Come on, come on!
- Oh, no.

Later, dudes!

Bagel Rat, I...

Huh?
He's alive!
Oh, gosh, my phone!
Oh, my baby's back!

Little sneak!

And I see you got something for me, too!
Ice Bear admires Bagel Rat's survival skills.
Great bagel, great rat.
Thank you, Bagel Rat.

Oh, we got to get going!
Well, little fella, ah!
You know what, you worked really hard for this.
Here you go, buddy.
Carry on!

Keep doing what you do.

Aw, look, there he goes!
And so the urban legend lives on.
- Eh, I guess today wasn't so bad.

And I even got a decent workout.
Um, hey, you guys want to watch Bagel Rat videos?
Oh, heck yeah!
Whoo!
- Done!
