Data rolling in front of their eyes all through the night.
The arc of every curve, the pressure on every pedal.
Their eyes are his eyes.
Unfocus.
Stream.
The moment they stray... is the moment he falls.

It's an endurance test for drivers and cars that literally takes 24 hours to complete.
Fifty-five cars will start, but many fewer will reach the checkered flag.
With unprecedented access to six of the teams and the event itself, this is the story of a race that pushes technology to the limit, but where the ghosts of the past, are never far from the present.
A one-minute stop-and-go penalty for car number 17 for overtaking under the yellow.
With the penalty and the extra time spent driving in pit lane, that's gonna cost them nearly two minutes.
I was trying to prove to the team that I could do a good job, and I was getting so frustrated with the traffic.
And I thought I saw the green flag.
Unfortunately, I was still in the yellow zone.
I should have been more patient and waited to really be sure about it.
I was absolutely gutted to lose those two minutes and, um...
Audinumber 7... and gone.
So everything okay down in Audiland, it looks like.
This is the first big problem for Porsche.
It'sself-inflicted.
We had to talk a lot with-- with Brendon just to keep him up, because, obviously, he was the one causing the-- causing the penalty, and there was still more than half of the race distance to go.
Porsche Comms:
The two minutes Mark Webber's car lost with a penalty has pushed them back into 4th place.
And they're behind not only the two Audis, but their sister car, the Porsche 19, driven by Le Mans rookies
Nick Tandy, Earl Bamber, and Nico Hulkenberg.
Looks like the bonnet has completely ripped off the Nissan number 22.
In 20th position, that was their best placed car.
with a puncture with no lights, trying to work my way back to the-- to the pits.
Um, I knew that if I stopped on track then it was game over.
But if I got it back, there was a chance we could get it back out.
I had a few hairy moments on the way but managed to-- to get it back to the pits.
And marshals in attendance with fire extinguishers.
It is smoldering gently.
Nissan Comms:
Jann Mardenborough:
Rebellion Comms:
They've bitten off an enormous amount to bring three cars.
That could have been us.
Yeah, we're just over half way.
Uh, car 13 is in ninth place.
It managed to recover from the early incident where it got clouted by another car and ended up in thegravel.
12 is a few places further behind.
We broke a drive shaft just around the halfway mark, and it took us about 40 minutes to replace that and fix it.

His dad never competed at Le Mans, but was a Formula One world champion.
Nico Prost in French:
Nico Prost:
I always feel a bit more nervous at that time.
Bart Hayden:
Not many people are about in the paddock.
And that's the time when the drivers on the track are most at risk.
I go to the front with the crew.
I get into the mood.
I actually don't think about the outcome.
Its incredible how long the body can stay awake for.
I'm going to do a quadruple stint, which means like three hours in the car.
I know it's going to be pitch black, and I have no time to adapt.
And in the night it's a different kind of driving.
You have less vision for sure.
I mean, you drive much more with feeling and much more with knowledge.
Your visibility is 40% of on daylight.
It always amazes me that we do around the same lap times than in daylight.
I think there's something almost illicit about watching racing in the dark.
Because in some ways, it really shouldn't happen.
Anybody who's studied warfare will tell you that the best time to attack is during the night
Because of the cooler temperatures, the tires can last longer.
That means the drivers stay in the cars often longer during the darkness hours than they do in the day time.
That means that their concentration levels have to be sustained for a longer period of time.
That takes a very specific type of driver to want to do that and to be able to put themselves through that.
I still hark back to 1995 when Jay Jay Leto was driving a McLaren.
It was pouring of rain, and during the night he made up a couple of laps on everybody else, and the car goes on to win the race.
Nick Tandy in the number 19 Porsche has managed to get ahead of the number 7Audi,
And that's why he's now leading the race.
Wolfgang Hatz in German:
Porsche Comms:
Bit of a fairytale so far.
Only a couple years ago, Earl was working as high-speed driving instructor in Malaysia, and you've gotto just wonder what's going through his mind right now.
I learned to drive when I was two or three years old on my dad's knee.
Then I got into go karting.
After that, I moved into racing cars.
In the beginning, I didn't really like the idea that people with more money can go further places than you because of their financial backing.
We never had the funding to be able to go to Europe or the means to go there, so I did a lot of my primary racing in New Zealand and Asia.
With the financial crisis in like '08,'09, ran out of money, so had no sponsorship or anything like that.
You need to keep fighting, you need to sleep on people's couches, and you know, just never giving up on the dream.
Adrian's a very good friend of mine.
I have to say he's the guy that started off this whole Porsche journey.
I think without Adrian's help
I would have never got into a Porsche racecar.
Teaching me the simple stuff about getting into a car, driving a car properly.
One day he gave me chance to drive his car, he sat in the passenger seat.
"First time driving a Porsche,
"never in his life driven a GT3 car, and he's so bloody fast."
Unfortunately, nobody knew Earl back then.
We went out and got a three year old car, or four year old car.
Starts first race--
And a long story short, by the end of the season, he was the champion of the Carrera Cup Asia.
I was in my apartment in KL, and my boss called me, and he said, "I have a Christmas present for you from Porsche.
"You need to write in the dates for Le Mans this year.
You'll drive the 9/19 hybrid."
And there's a driver change over at Audi.
Andre Lotterer, thereigning champ is out of the car.
He just couldn't keep up with that rookie in the Porsche.
Yeah, I mean, it's a big challenge always to fight any car at night.
And it looks like, even though they're rookies, they know what they're doing there.
And for sure, they're a bit fast at night.
We lost a bit of ground, but I'm confident we have a good car to beat them in the daytime.
Well, it's been an intense night of racing here at Le Mans.
When darkness fell, Mark Webber in the Porsche number17 was leading the race, but then he got served a penalty for his co-driver, Brendon Hartley, overtakingunder the yellow, and that pushed him down the leaderboard to 4th.
Well, he's in the car again now and desperate to win the race, back in the hunt, up to third place.
You had the warm-up on Saturday morning.
So you've been really awake for 30 hours.
People say, "What's the most important thing?
How do you keep your concentration?"
The most important thing for me, generally, is the next corner.
Dunlop, boom.
Tertre rouge, relax on the straight.
First chicane, next chicane.
Very rarely putting your mind in another point of the track.
You can sort of guess where you are with the time.
You know the position.
We need to hold on for the rest of the race.
Did he hitsomething there?
It looked like his engine cover just flewstraight off.
Audi Comms:
Fässler on Comms:
The whole back of that car has been shredded by something.
Audi Comms:
It's been a tremendous car race, unbelievable.
