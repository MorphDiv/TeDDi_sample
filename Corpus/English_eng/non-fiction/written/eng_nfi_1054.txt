Episode Twenty-One
(Sound of riding horses)
Young Master, we come back earlier as planned.
Would His Majesty be mad?
As long as we have this box, we have nothing to worry about.
You give this box to His Majesty as soon as possible.
After I catch Yan Xun,
I shall go to the court immediately.
Hurry up.
Yes, Your Young Master.
(Sound of riding horses)
Something terrible happened.

Why are you in such a hurry?
Young Master, something terrible happened.
His Grand Master was assassinated.
Who did that?
According to the maids, it was that wicked maid, Xing'er.
How dare she.
(Sound of riding horses)
(Sound of walking)
Every mechanism in Jile Pavilion is on this map.
(Sound of girls running away scared)
(Sound of gears rotating)
(Screaming)
(A sharp sound of blade)
Find a place to hide yourself.
Don't go anywhere else.
Otherwise, you might trigger the mechanism.
It will kill you.
Where is his head?
The head.

He was beheaded.
Useless.
He was killed by a maid.
It is good though.
No one can give me orders after I take control over the Red Hills Court.
You are absolutely right.
Where are the guards?
They were all killed by Xing'er.
Let's go.
Let's capture that wicked maid.
Yes, sir.
(Sound of running)
(Sound of gears rotating)
(A sharp sound of blade)
(Sound of running)
It is time to change shift.
(Sound of doors opening)
Young Master.
(Intense background music)
Where is Shopkeeper Zuo?
(Sound of riding a horse)
Young Master, you are finally back.
I was tricked by the spies from the Liang State.
I just escaped.
You look like something is wrong.
What is going on?
His Grand Master, Yuwen Xi, was assassinated.
Who did that?
I am not sure yet.
I only know it was one of the maids who were sent to Jile Pavilion tonight.
In addition,
Xing'er, Xiaoqi and Xiaoba are gone.
(Sound of flying)
Xing'er, when I am doing business,
I always keep my words.
I won't let you down.
(Sound of dropping a box)
I know you treat me very well.
Hurry up.
What are you doing?
Can't you tell?
I killed Yuwen Xi.
I am escaping now.
Don't look like me as if you were surprised.
Yuwen Xi killed my sister.
I ravaged for my sister by killing him.
It is my mercy.
This is what you are.
I have always lived in danger, fearing for my life.
If I don't disguise myself, how could I possible survive?
Great.
You even tricked me.
You taught me well.
However, there is no need to feel sad because of losing me.
I am just a spy of sacrifice trained by you.
We are the only two people here.
You don't need to pretend.
You and the Red Hills Court are against each other.
You should be happy that
I killed Yuwen Xi.
You are saying
I should be grateful of what you did?
There is no need for that.
Because you are going to pay with your life for killing Linxi.
(Sound of flighting)
What exactly do you want?
Avenge for Linxi.
I have explained the reason why Linxi died.
Explained?
What are you going to exlain?
Explain the fact that Linxi was used or the fact that
Yuwen Zhuo is still alive?
How did you know about it?
Does it matter?
I only blame myself for finding the truth too late.
In order to make the world believe
Yuwen Zhuo is dead, you sacrificed Linxi's life.
Xing'er, listen to me.
Don't call me Xing'er.
I am not Xing'er.
(Sound of the ring breaking)
I am not Xing'er.
(Sound of fighting)
Xing'er.
Let go of me.
Let go of me.
Yuwen Yue.
I no longer want to have anything to do with the Green Hills Court.
Xing'er.
(Sound of falling)
(Sound of flying)
(Sound of riding a horse)
Xing'er.
(Sound of riding a horse)
You can put me down now.
You are not grateful at all.
I saved you once more.
How are you going to repay me?
You are just a little girl, but you caused a huge trouble.
It was bad luck for the Yuwen Houseld to choose you as a maid.
I finally kill that bastard,
Yuwen Xi.
I still need to thank you though.
Thank you for saving my life.
However,
I don't want you to involve in this
You should leave
What to involve?
If you go back to Yan with me how could they do anything to you?
Come with me
Prince Yan Xun
I agreed to go with you
But don't think there's anything more between us
Fine
Okay
I thought too much, OK?
Fine
Didn't know someone has two sisters waiting at the west gate
You saw them
No，I didn't
I came for you knowing you are in danger
Then they must be waiting for me at the western gate
Let's go
What are you waiting for?
Hurry up
Master
Where is Xing'er?
Yan Xun took her
Prince Yan Xun?
What?
The majesty has just ordered the guards of all families should set off attack his house to arrest prince Yan Xun
Gather the Guards of Moon now
Yes
And, master
The Lord wants to see you asap
The majesty is determined to execute the Yan family
Don't you get yourself involved
Xun'er and Yue'er are bloody brothers
I'm worried about him
Please stop him from helping Yan
Master
Grandfather
Did you catch Xing'er?
Not yet
Is it because you can't or you just don't want to
I've try my best
But I couldn't get her
Really?
Yes
That Xing'er killed Yuwen Xi and framed you
Do you know it?
Yes
Then go catch her
Killing an important official is a serious incident
If she run away you can't explain yourself
Go catch her
When I got there it was too late
You
Yue'er
You changed
Are you going to risk the whole Green Hills and me just for a girl?
Fine
Let's put her aside
But today
I ask you to let alone your principles and emotions
and do not involve in Yan Xun's affair for the Green Hills for the Eyes of God
and for yourself
Grandfather
Yue'er
You are not only the friend of Yan Xun, but also the grandson of mine,
the master of the Green Hills
The disappear of Lord Dingbei is settled
The majesty has made up his mind
All the things you are doing are of no use
You can do nothing except killing yourself
Zhanmou
Yes
Kneel on my name
Beg your master to consider about your lives
Master
I kneel for the lord
Master
Please think about it
I know you are dissatisfied
Dare not
Your dare not means not willing
But Yue'er you should always keep it in your mind
You can't let the whole family sacrifice for your own so-called friendship
You have no right to do it
They do not deserve such destiny either
Grandfather
Yue'er
Okay
I'll go right now
Lord
Xiaoba
I go check if sister comes
It's nine o' clock now
Why isn't sister here?
Xiaoba
What if something happened?
Something like what?
I think she just doesn't want to help us
She's not even here
We are just none of her business
Xiaoba
Sister has been so nice of us
How could you say that
Me
Didn't you worry about that?
She is now following
Prince Yan Xun
Once she is in Yan she'll lead a wealthy life
She won't care about us anymore
Who are we for her?
Quiet
She's not that kind of person
If sister heard it thought we do not believe her she would be heartbroken
Heartbroken?
She is so happy with prince
Yan Xun
Xiaoba
I've told you
I don't want to leave the Green Hills
At least I could serve master Yue
I'm fine with that
Xiaoba don't think like that
Didn't sister said
When we get to Yan we'll be free
We don't need to serve anybody
Sister, sister
Where is she, our sister?
Sister
She won't disappoint us out of no reason
Crap
What if something really happened?
Xiaoba
How about us finding her?
Hurry up
No.

Fine
Just stay here.

Don't go anywhere
I'll be back after I find the sister
Sis
Sis
Xiaoba
How can you leave me alone?
You followed me
Wait
Wait
Master
Yan Xun ran towards the west gate
Let's go
Where is Xiaoqi and Xiaoba?
Prince
Is everyone here?
Yes
Prince
Why so frightened？
Something's wrong
There is sign of mobilize the troops in all of the military camp
We'd better not stay here
We should leave now
You think you can leave?
Step back.

Leave now, prince
Step back
What are you doing, Zhao Xifeng?
Yan Xun, as a hostage and guest
You get out of town with no permission
Isn't that unsuitable?
I want to go out to take a ride
Why so serious with something so subtle?
Then it's not your lucky day
The majesty has just ordered:
No one shall get out of Chang'an today
Anyone disobeys the rules shall be executed at present
As the royal majesty ordered taken by Yan Xun
Lord Yanbei is a traitor that tends to rebel our governor
He appointed Wei Shuye to arrest the eldest son of the lord,
Yan Xun and take him into custody at Panjian Institution
Yan Xun, put down your weapon
Don't resist us
Why wasting time on him?
They all came for you
I'm sorry, I get you involved
It's okay
We'll be even after this
Yan Xun, we have to follow the majesty's order
Don't blame me on your way to hell
Put down your weapon.

Or I'll kill him
Bitch
I'll kill you
Brother, release them
Save me
Let them go
Let's move
Hurry up!

Move
Let's go!

Move
Careful
Why doesn't she come?
Yes
Didn't she said we shall meet at the west gate?
Get away.

We are arresting the traitors
Anyone help them shall be killed like them
Search the street
Hurry up
Shut up.

Follow me
Move.

We should protect ourself first.

Open the door
Open the door.

Open the door
Mother
Huanhuan, what should I do?
How could I escape?
Princess, your mother let me
Send you some food
Is my mother out there?
Who else is there?
No, she is not outside.
Only two guards at the door
How about Caiwei?
Where is she?
Sister Caiwei is held by the imperial concubine
Princess, please have some food
These are your favorite
Come here
Can you do me a favor?
Princess
Take off your clothes
What are you doing, princess?
I want to escape
Escape?
I just want to leave the palace for a while
Do me a small favor
Borrow me your clothes
Lay down on my bed
Pretend to sleep waiting for me
Please forgive me, princess
If the concubine finds out she'll kill me
Get up and listen
If I don't leave now
I cannot save
Brother Yan Xun
If I don't save him he will die
If he dies
I won't live alone
Do you want to see us dying?
No, right?
So now you are the only one here that can help me
If you save me and Yan Xun, you'll be the benefactor of us both
Stop
Untie him
You can go
The majesty will come after you, traitor
Cut the crap
You want to leave or not?
You shouldn't let him go
If I kill him we will become real traitors
I cannot take that risk
He won't be grateful even if you let him go
And
He'll blame you later on
If we can leave safely no need to kill him
If we cannot, no need either
By the way, you helped me just now and you cut his fingures
You can't get away with it any more
Who get away from whom?

Yeah
After the fight at the west gate everyone would know you are mine
I belong to myself, not anyone else
Who's yours?
You are mine
I have something important to do
I am not wasting time with you here
The whole Chang'an is searching for you little girl
Where are you going?
Thank you for your concern
But who told you I'm just a little girl?
Yeah, you are right
One VS ten
Those rough boys seem like the weak little girls compared to you
So?
So however strong you are you are just a little girl with your slim body
And however cruel you are a little girl in my heart
You said cruel who?
I am slim, so what?
People live by using their brain
So strong and tall as you have no brain
Being caught and nearly killed by Zhao Xifeng?
That's why
I need you to protect me back to Yan
I'm not arguing this with you
Prince
We need to see the big picture
We are not away from Chang'an
We are still in danger
Not to mention all those grand families are hunting us right now
Let her leave alone
Yan Xun
Thank you for saving me so many times
Friends like us cannot keep accompanied with all those challenges lying forward
Take care
When I find Xiaoqi and Xiaoba maybe we will go to Yan too
I'll go find you if there is a chance
Really?
Don't lie to me
Just consider it not lies
Wait
Young Master Huai.
We have found where Yan Xun is.
Where?
2500 metres outside the west gate.
Lead the way.
Yes, sir.
How did you get hurt this badly?
Speak.
Wait here.
I am going to capture Yan Xun that bastard and take revenge for you.
(Smirking)
(Sound of riding horse)
Mother, I am the one who plotted this.
Don't blame her.
Take her out.

Your Highness, please forgive me.
Your Highness.
- Get up.

- Your Highness please help me.

Let go of her.
Your Highness.
- Don't punish her.

Don't punish her.
Mother.
Mother, I am begging you.
Let go of me.
Mother.
It's my fault.
I forced her to do that.
She is innocent.
If you want to punish someone, punish me then.
You can punish me by caning.
Please don't punish her.
She is innocent.
(Sound of caning and screaming)
Your Highness.
Your Highness please help me.
Mother.
Mother.
Mother.
I forced her to do that.
It was all my fault.
I know I made a mistake.
I know I made a mistake.
I won't do it again.
I am begging you.
Mother.

Please stop punishing her.
Mother.
Mother.

Mother.
I'm wrong.
I beg your pardon.
Please don't punish her.
It was all my fault.
Imperial Concubine.
I used too much force to beat her up, and she is dead.
Nothing can be accomplished without norms or standards.
Your father wants to kill Duke Dingbei, for Duke Dingbei broke his rules.
I punish this little maid, for her broke my rules.
You are my daughter, born in the purple.
I'm reluctant to punish you.
But this little maid, is not that lucky.
Mark my words:
If the death of this little maid can make you feel less guilty when you think of Yan Xun,
then her death is a worthy one.
Xiaoba.
Young Master Yue is being silly, he actually sending me Changeable Kettle Man to deal with such little girl.
Where is Xiaoba?
I don't know Xiaoba.
You don't know?
She is the girl who you are dressing up like.
I'm just going on a message.
For who?
Say it.
Yuwen Yue.
Go.
You killed her?
Who let you do this?
You are alive.
All thanks to your lucky words.
I'm still alive.
However...
I'm not sure whether you can be alive.
You use this trick well.
You taught me well.
Why can't you just let me go?
Won't you be hurt if I am dead?
Will you really kill me?
You can try it.
Good.
(Sound of gasping)
I taught you all your kung-fu.
How do you kill me?
That Xing'er killed Yuwen Xi, and slandered you.
Do you know that?
Killing officer is a serious matter.
If she escapes, your sin is beyond dispute.
Capture her quickly.
Take her.
I save you again.
Let's go back to Yanbei together.
Are you mad?
Come to save me at this moment.
You want to die?
What will you do if I don't come back?
Hold me tight.
Drop it.
Don't chase them.
