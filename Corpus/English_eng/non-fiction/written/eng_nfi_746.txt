you don't make it look like a Toros Locos kill.

One of yours, a Toro, killed my distributor in cold blood.

Always good to be back in the neighborhood.

So, uh, shall we get started?
So Mike came to your house last night?
Told her not to tell me that he came by.
He didn't realize that I had custody of them over the weekend.
He thought I'd be home alone.
Maybe he just wanted to talk about the case.
Bullshit.
He told Mak that Donovan was the mole, right?
I think he went over there to kill you because dead men can't exonerate themselves.
Ain't that about a bitch. [Sighs] Fuck.
Before I came here this morning,
Mike asked if we were still working together to prove Donovan is the mole.
I told him yes.
You double-crossing piece of shit, man...
No, hey, hey, mistakes were made, maybe.
But if Angela's right, and he's looking to kill and frame somebody, we go to Mak, we better have enough for an arrest warrant, or we're all gonna be on Mike's hit list.

[Beeping]
[Lock Clicks]
St. Patrick gave me this phone.
It came from a Lobos contact,
Hugo Sanchez.
What?
How the fuck did he get it, Angela?
A couple of days before Greg died,
I called the last number dialed from this phone.
It was another burner cell.
Someone inside the Federal Building picked up.
They didn't say anything, so I couldn't tell who it was.
It wasn't Greg, because he was in Babylon at the time with Agent Medina, interviewing Kate Egan.
And if you didn't have that phone, Saxe...
And I didn't.
It was Mike.
He was working with Hugo Sanchez for Lobos.
He's the mole, he killed Greg, and planted the phone to cover his tracks.
You can't prove that.
Maybe Greg hid it in his own apartment
He hid it after he wiped off his own prints.
And then he shot himself to cover it up.
And then his motherfucking ghost hid the murder weapon at Truth.
We can't introduce the phone anyway.
Where'd St. Patrick get it, Angela?
Did he tell you?
I thought not.
We're saying that a US attorney worked as a mole for a Mexican drug cartel, then murdered an FBI agent, framed that agent as the mole, then tried to frame a second man for the agent's murder.
Yes.
And our evidence is an inconclusive tape and a burner cell with a shaky chain of custody?
Also yes.
It's not like he's gonna confess.

I'll give you everything you want.
In exchange, I want immunity.
And why would I do that?
Because if you don't,
I'll say that every single one of the hundred or so cases I closed was done with influence from Felipe Lobos.
And the scandal alone will rock the United States Attorney's Office for the next 20 years.
You'd be buried in appeals and wrongful conviction suits.

Mike Sandoval.
Mike Sandoval?
The Head of Criminal?
Jesus, that man stood in court and accused James of the same murder he committed?
He's being remanded to the MCC tonight, where he'll be held until his transfer to protective custody.
So James really was innocent?
I'll give him the good news.
And Proctor too.
He won't hear any other way.

Okay.

If you'da been convicted, the appeal process would have been a fucking field day.
Yeah?
Yeah, we sure do.
Look, Sandoval's gonna flip, and fast.
The question is, what's he gonna say when he does?
If he knows you're Ghost, he can testify to that.
If he knows you two killed Lobos...
Oh, he tells them that, we're fucked.
And if he knows the two of you have been running a criminal organization this entire time, he could spell RICO prosecution for all three of us.
Not if he ain't alive to testify.
