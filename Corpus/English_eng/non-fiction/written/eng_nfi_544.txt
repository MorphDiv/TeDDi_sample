Breaking out is just the beginning on prison break.
Everything I did i did for family.
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays, and check out our other fox programs--
Legacy, Gotham and shots fired.
The department is obviously corrupt.
Only on fox.
Previouslyonprisonbreak...

Michael:

Who the hell is the guy?
He's my brother.
Can't die on me now, Michael, you know, you're gonna tell me why I'm your whip hand.

He's been busted up real bad.

Jacob:

It's not safe.
Sara:

Never thought I'd see this face again.
Michael:

Luca:

How about you step out and pay us the 100 grand you owe us.
There is nobility in you, Lincoln.

We're gonna need you.

About the right things.
Sara:

It's him.

Jacob isPoseidon.
He'sa CIAoperative, deepcover.

He targeted me for my skills.
Michael, he's with our son right now.
I'll get to the states as soon as I can.
Didmyhusband,Jacobness , ask you to work on my cell phone?
He said he was looking to find thepeoplewhowerestalking his wife, so I did a data dive.
Where's my son?
I have him.
And whether or not i have to threaten him is entirely contingent upon you putting the gun down.
Van gogh:

They made you.
Run!
Whip:

Hey!
Hey!
Hey, yo, where we headed?
Marseille.
Whip:

Jacob:

I know everything about you.
Even your most mundane actions, like the zoo.
What's with you and the zoo?
Michael:

Jacob:

Alotof thinking.

Turns out he's not just a rebel leader-- he's a murderous sociopath.
That's the only way to make omelets.
I need to know more about our targets.
If I'm facilitating escapes, we can't have surprises.
Be proud.

Don't act like you're suddenly a fan of the status quo, okay?
The system, it's slow, stupid, and doomed to fail.
That's why you had to bust your brother out in the first place.
New ink since the last time I saw you.
Working on a new plan?

Just get tired of looking at empty skin.
Uh-huh.
You know, it was those tats at fox river that caught my eye in the first place.
I had to know everything about the man who wore his plans on his skin.
In plain sight yet so mysterious.
The key to real power is to disappear.
Hi, professor ness.

Yeah, the secret to real power is to never betray your intentions, to wear nothing on your sleeve.
And to never let anyone see your face.
Come on in.
Next time I'm sitting in solitary,
I'll think of you in here, running the world in air-conditioned comfort.
Jacob:

You all set for Myanmar?
It's only a few weeks off.
That's why I'm here.
I want to bring someone on board.
Oh, really?

I've been watching this guy.

Watching him?

The last thing I was to do is suck someone else into this.
He'll have my back and he'll speed things up, increase our odds.
Not exactly a distinguished career.
He's held up well in prison.

And he grew up without a family.
It means he can be manipulated.
If you're planning something,
I'll always be a step ahead of you.
You know that.
I can see everything in your eyes.
It's what's behind the eyes that counts, professor.
Hmm.
So you're gonna wait a year for me to find my way out of sittwe?
Or are you gonna get me a partner, so we get on with the business of changing the world?
Done.
I need some food.
I'm with you.
Linc, it's Sara.
She's back in New York.
Lincoln:

That's what I'm trying to find out.
What is it, Michael?
Something's wrong.
Yes, you will.
I got to get back to the states.

You're kaniel outis, remember?
You're on every no-fly list in the world.
Jacob's done something to Sara.

How do you know?

She referred to our son as junior.
We agreed we'd never call him that.
He's baiting you, Michael.
It worked.
Hey, buddy.
Where's mom?
Oh.

That is quite a pirate ship.
Although it would be a little hard to sail with the mast that far forward.
Your ship might tip over.

What do you mean?
It's for Jimmy.

I always find his.
He doesn't always find mine.
Wait a second, how is this drawing a map?
This is the park.
That's the playground.
And this is the sidewalk.
Impressive.
You put a code in the drawing.
So, okay, where did you hide the legos?
These cannons are pools at the park.
But there's an extra one, in the sand.
That's where I buried the legos.
Well done, Mike.
Well done.
I've tried everyone.

All my contacts.

Linc, I got to get home.
I can't spend another two weeks on a cargo ship.
He's got my wife and kid.
There may be another way.
You told me about the last seven years of your life.
Haven't told you about mine.
After Sara got exonerated, she left Panama.
Me and Sofia stayed behind and opened a dive shop.
We broke up, and everything went to hell.
You weren't there to stop me, so before I knew it,
I was in the old hood, doing odd jobs.
Odd jobs meaning what?
Moving things from point a to point b.
For Luca abruzzi.
John abruzzi's son.
Yeah.
I just wanted some quick cash to kick-start my life.
They told me not to look in the boxes.
But I looked in the boxes.
The amount of fentanyl they're smuggling out of Europe-- tens of thousands of pills in every box-- it's just killing people.
So I dumped a box in a dumpster, 100 grand's worth.
Now you're in hock to abruzzi's son.
Yeah.

But maybe it's a way to get back to the states real fast.
Luca:

You actually think i want to help you?
What if I can get you the $100k?
$100k?
How are you gonna come up with that-- crawling around the back alleys of Chicago?
I'm not in Chicago.

Marseilles?

I've been working on a couple deals.

Sureyoudo .

That's why I'm calling.
I need to sneak into the states invisible, like your pills.
Thoseflightsyougot  comingoutof Europe-- the fentanyl flights-- i need a few seats.
I'll tell you what.
I'll make a few calls.
'Cause either I'm gonna see you andgetthatmoney, orI 'mgonnaseeyou , andyou'regonnaget something awholelotworse.
I can't believe I'm doing this to myself again.
Difference is this time you're not alone.
God, these things are disgusting.
What they call 'em again?
Boudinnoir.
Not sure what's in them.
I don't think your French is as good as you think it is.
Yo, be happy you're not eating snails.
Hey.
Do you think they noticed?
Let's not take any chances.
Guys.
Your faces were on the news.
Whip:

We got to move, papi.

Hold.

If you can get to Lyon by midnight,
I can get you on a flight.
IgotawarehouseinNewYork.

We'll be there.
Can't decide whether I want you to have that money or not, Burrows.
Killingyoumightbe alotmoresatisfying.
Jacob:

Wecanbe prettysure he'scomingbacktoithaca.
I need some clarification.
Why would he come back here...
To the states when he's more wanted here than anywhere else in the world?
Of course.
Because of them.
He had a life before he worked for me, a name-

A family.
And when he went away, i ended up looking after them.
Ended up... falling for them.
Well...
He wants to kill me.
He thinks I stole his life, ruined him, which speaks to his dissociative mind.
I mean, he's a murderer, a turncoat, a terrorist.
But we'll use it.
I'll be the bait if I have to.
So we can go about taking him down once and for all.
He's not just gonna stroll in here.
He's too clever for that.
That's why we got someone even more clever.
Thoreau?
Guy's a pencil neck.
A pencil neck with insight into Scofield's plan.
So you, in turn, can be the hammer.
Nelson:

He routed the image through a server to this bluehawaii guy, but it could have been secretly subrouted to another, yet unknown, recipient to use the information encoded in it.
Information?
It's actually incredible.
Encrypted in the arabic, the images are all sorts of stuff.
Apparently, mundane as hell.
Visiting hours for zoos, links to defunct message boards on the Internet.
What message boards? both of which carry... this.
Images of the Harlan gaines murder.
What's the bastard doing rubbing that in our faces?
Of all the things to encrypt, why that?
What's that get you?
Stegaonographically, a lot.
Steganography is the practice of concealing information in the code that makes up digital files.
Russians do it, Chinese, everybody.
He's probably thinking if anyone sees this, this'll be as far as they'll look.
But I'm already going inside the image, breaking down the data that comprises it.

Point is we put big data, ai on this, we can crunch any codes hidden in there pretty quickly.
And that's what I'm doing.
Nice work, but the truth is, if I've done my job, he may reveal his intentions to us first.
Because I've got him so far off his game now, he'llstart toplayhiscardstooearly ...
Teddy.
"But in return, you must take a life."
Jacob: ...

You have to call this pay phone in France.
Wait.

Not until you find out why you're my whip-hand.
I have to go to Chicago to find that out?
Safe travels.
In the grandiosity of his plan, he'lllosesight ofthesimplestdetails.
Thephonehe textedmewith  was located in Lyon, France last night.
It was turned off in an airport terminalat11 :51P.M 20minutesbeforeadirect flighttoNewYorkwhere you'll be waiting for him to put this game to bed for good.
Woman:

He just powered back up.
We got him.
Look out!
Back of the plane.
Uh, excuse me!

You're not allowed...
Looks like the game's still going.
Torrent downloaded from RARBG it's impressive how you get these drugs in the country just by bribing small-time airport officials.
I'm guessing you got about five million bucks worth of fentanyl in here.
So what?
You and your brother here are gonna lecture me?
We were actually debating on whether
I should give you the 100k or not.
He says it's blood money.
I agree.

I don't have it.
Grab his guys, bring 'em to the back and shoot 'em.
I don't think you want to add murder to your arrest warrant.
Wait.
Arrest warrant?
That guy out there is a DEA informant.
We have him in our pocket.
He owes us.

They're gonna rain down on you and your pills.
Unless you forgive my brother's debt.
Then our informant won't make the call.
Have your brother fighting your battles, do you?
No.
Why don't you tell your guys to drop the guns, and you and I can have it out?
What do you say, Luca?
Scare that guy off.
Bring these guys to the back.
They make a move, he makes a call.
Yeah?

I warned you.
We got company.
Michael:

Let's go.
All they had to see were DEA hats and suvs, and they were gone.
Famous Michael Scofield.
Sheba.

You have no idea how happy i am to see you back home.
We're not home yet.
All right, so what's next?
How do we get this son of a bitch?
Wedon'tdo anything.
Your part is over.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Tricking abruzzi's kid is one thing.
Poseidon-- he knows your face.
Been tracking you since you went to Yemen.
You've been a warrior, and I owe you.
But your face is a liability now to you and your family.
I don't want you to risk that.
They may know his face, but they don't know mine.
It's the punch you don't see coming that knocks you out.
That's my sheba.
You take care of her, all right?
I take care of him, you mean.
I love you, brother.
Love you, too.
Be safe, okay?

Bye.

Well...
When you need me again, you know where to find me.
We'll transport her at 1600 hours.
Lay low until then.

Hey?
That doesn't bother you-- what you just saw in there?
Down in the basement with his wife, the woman he says he fell for?
Stop.
I'm done with 21-void after this.
After we get Scofield... outis-- whatever his name is--
I'm done.
That's all I ever wanted, to get gaines' killer, but what he's got going on in there-- that's not normal.
It's personal.
Something sicker.
There's no leaving 21-void, Van.

He hired us because we are the best.
We can do whatever we want.
And if we want to disappear after this...
We can disappear.
There's no getting out.
If you think that way...
Then you're a prisoner, too.
Man:

Five minutes?
Something ain't right.
The product is still here.
Come on.
It was all staged.
Clever.
But Burrows is gonna die for it.
I don't know how we're gonna find him.
He's in the wind.
Maybe not.
Ez pass transponders.
Santora's got a guy at transit authority.
I bet you he can us what roads they've been taking and when.
Then it's up to us to comb the neighborhoods, find the vehicles, and put a bullet in that son of a bitch once and for all.
Man :

Unattendedbaggageis a security risk and may result...
I got a weird request.
If I give you some coordinates, can you take me to 'em?
See what I can do.
No.
Unless this cab's got pontoons, ain't gonna happen.
These coordinates are in the middle of lake Michigan.
This is it.
Lincoln:

I don't think they're here, Michael.
Unless that's what he wants us to think.
Come on.
Get ready to get us out of here as fast as you can.
Sheba:

Be careful.
Thanks.
What's wrong?
That's why Sara never responded.
Iwasn'tallowed tocontactanyone, butshewasmywife .
Ireachedouttoherinaway
Ithoughtonlyshe wouldknow .
Butheknewmyways ,too.
Nothing.
What are you doing?
That's not Sara, Michael.
He doesn't know I know that.
That's the right answer.
She's alive.
He must be right there with her.
I'm gonna set a meeting.
And what, you're just gonna show up and show your face?
Yes.
That means Poseidon has to show his face, too.
And the endgame begins.
It's high noon, boss.
I'm not seeing him.
And you shouldn't.

Which would be me?
Maybe not.
Black SUV.
Something I can help you with?
Car service.

They got another ride.

Are you sure?
Hit the road.
Mark the black SUV.
No need.

Walkaway,please.

Okay,actthetiniestbit flustered.
Now repeat these words back to me loud enough to be heard:
"They didn't show.
I'mcomingbacktoyounow."
They didn't show.
I'm coming back to you now.
Now we have a game.
He'salreadyrevealed his brother, his biggest piece.
Soon he'll have to show his face.

What the...
I lost him.
Hey.
Can you hear me?
Damn it.
No signal.
What are you doing here?
I lost reception in the garage.
Damn it, you fell right into it.
Now they've got a mark on us.
Black sedan.
He's heading west.
Please!
Please, don't shoot.
You okay?
So that's what the dog who's destroying my country looks like.
Talk to me.
Lincoln:

We're on the corner of third and Washington by an alley.
Getherenow.
HehadSarawithhim but we couldn't see her.

Sheba:

Oh, my god.

There was no one in the backseat?

What's that?
My son did this.
He's good.
There might be something here.
It's a ship.
A pirate ship with three pirates-- man, woman and a boy.
That's me, Sara and...

What do you think that is?
It's a...

Think it's Jacob?
Must be.
This is a message.

Mikey's left something encoded in that?
Yeah.

He's got my DNA.
He didn't even know you were coming.
Sara must have told him.

She must have told him i was coming.
There's definitely something here.

What is it?
It's one of Luca's guys.
Sheba:

How the hell did he track us here?
I don't know.

We got to go.
Linc?
I got it.
This ship, this galleon.
The body of water it's on.

There's a lake, a lake shaped exactly like it, up in the finger lakes district.
"Long lake."
This x would be on the east shore of that lake.
He's telling us where he is.
I'm trying to figure out if you lost your mind or not.
There's only one way to find out.
Uh-uh.

You're going back to buffalo.

I want you to be with your family, look after the refugees.
Linc, I'm a part of this fight, too...
What was that?
It's good-bye.
I could never forgive myself if something happened to you.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
Can I rent a boat?
I want to take one out on the lake.
Been thinkin'.
God...
I been thinking.
'Cause a hard bargain's been presented to me, andI 'mconsideringsomething that's-that'sgonnaseemlike theoldTheodorebagwell.
T-bag.
Andifthat'sindeed what'scoming itwon'tbe thework of a cold-blooded man.
Anditwon'tbeforsin orforhate.
Ifthere'sbloodonmyhands , knowthis,world it'll be for love.
how you doing, buddy?
I'm sick of the lake house.
I want to go home.
I know.

We'll go home soon.
Don't worry.
Is mom okay?
She's, uh...
She's a little under the weather.
She's just resting.
Everything will be fine, kiddo.
Everything will be back to normal soon enough, okay?
Michael, go get him.

Thanks, man, that was fun.

Yeah, great.

What kind of honorific is whip?
Who's asking?
A man drawn into this by destiny.
Okay.

I don't exactly cotton to strange men coming up to me in the middle of the night, you know?
Only one person calls me whip-- you ain't him.
Nobody calls you that.
Man who gave me this hand.

Kaniel outis.
Or for those of us who know him,
Michael Scofield.
Who are you?
We all got handles, don't we?
Outis.

But you're Dave Martin, aren't you?
How'd you know that?
Huh?
You better start talking, old man.
You don't want to tangle with this.
Neither do you.
All your answers are right in here, all right?
West Virginia honky-tonk, 1991, pretty waitress, bunch of personal business between us after closing, and then I git, 'cause Johnny law's breathing down my neck.
Lacking a forwarding address,
I never heard from her again.
What are you trying to tell me?
Scofield was looking for a partner, combing prisons, looking for someone who could handle himself.
And with your innate ability to thrive, rising to the top in even the worst of cages, you reminded him of a certain someone.
And so he did a little research.
Wanted to know what we all want to know.
Did you learn it...
Or was it ingrained in you?
It was ingrained in you, son.
You got it from me.
Linc, he's here.
Myson.

Hold on.
Hold up.
IthinkJacob'scomingback .
Ican'tbelieve I'mseeingmy son.
Something's wrong.
Sara's here, but...
Something'swrong.

I'm going in.
Lincoln:

You're clear.
Get your family.

Burrows!
Hi, Mike.
You know who I am?
I got your map.
I'm gonna get you and your mother out of here.
I...

Is someone in there with your mom?

We need to run.
Captioned by mediaaccessgroupatwgbh  the drama is just starting on prison break.
Now here are a few more shows to check out from fox.
Mommy has to go out of town for work.
Something ain't right here.
The department is obviously corrupt.
-I understand how you feel.

My son is dead.
- Man:

Their threats don't faze me.
This some sort of game to you?
Ashe:

Nobody comes out of this clean.
