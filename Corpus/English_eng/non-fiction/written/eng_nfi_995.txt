Ugh, where is this guy?
Deal was supposed to go down ten minutes ago.
Stupid criminals have no respect for the people trying to bust them.
Yeah, I really wish he'd show up.
I gotta go to the bathroom so bad.
That's, like, the third time today, man.
- What is going on with you?

So now she's making me drink eight glasses a day.
It's, like, there's water in soda, there's water in coffee,
There's little pools of water on pizza.
- That's grease, jake.

It's our guy.

Deal's going down.

All right, and then we're gonna pee.

Ocampo got away.

Dumb-Dumb tried to jump down the stairs.
Shattered his ankle.

Great, let's get 'em back to the Nine-Nine, see if floppy foot and his friend know where our man's hiding.
They don't know anything.
They're undercover Cops.
Floppy foot's a Cop?
Crap, that's Lieutenant Melanie Hawkins.
I know.

Hello, Lieutenant Hawkins.

These two bozos screwed up a three-month operation.
Well, this sucks.
Lieutenant Hawkins is my idol, and now she hates me.
She is so cool.
She's been buried alive three times.
I've only been buried alive once.
I heard she doesn't let anyone take her photograph so that she can still go undercover.
Hey, Rosa, delete all the pictures you have of me.
I don't have any.
Not even the splash mountain one?
Oh.

Well, Hawkins is more enraged than ever.
Why?

She wanted to use him to get to the Golden gang Bank robbers.
She thinks he's their fence.
Golden gang?

Those guys just hit a bank in Bushwick, took 6 mil in diamonds.
[sighs] that is a big deal.

You two, get in here.
You're in God's hands now.

You tank the operation,
And you put one of my men out of commission.
I am this close to suspending the both of you.
Almost looked like your fingers were actually touching.
We're sorry our signals got crossed.
This is everything we have on Ocampo.
Yeah, we've been on his tail for a while.
We know everything about him,
All the way down to his favorite fro-yo flavor...
Monkeyberry Marshmallow blaster.
The point is, we can help you find him.
You wanna help?

Sounds good.

Not looking for him.
We're gonna find Ocampo for her, and then she's not gonna be mad anymore.
- Dope.

[groans]
I swear, I would rather drink ginger ale, Rosa.
Honestly!

So a guy got stabbed at 3rd and union.
You know what that means.

[cheers and applause]
Wow, it's so nice and surprising
- when somebody thinks of others.

- Scully...

I was thinking about how stupid your face is.
That's it!
I'm licking all these bagels.

Oh, you think your spit's gonna stop me?
Brother, you don't know me at all.
- Mmm!

They've been fighting like little kids all morning, and I can't get 'em to stop.
I tried everything, ordering them to stop and...
Well, that's really all I tried.
But I'm their superior officer.

Guys, why are you fighting?

Every sunday after church,
Scully and I have dinner together at Wing Sluts.
We know.

Last night, scully said he was sick, so I went by myself.
Guess who was there, healthy as a clam?
Mr. Liar and his new tart Cindy Shatz.
What happened to our bro code?
Badge before va...

You always get mad when I spend time with Cindy,
So I lied, because I didn't want you to throw a fit...
- Ya cuck.

- No, you are!

My fountain pen is being re-nibbed in Germany.
Yes, it's all no one is talking about.
Due to its absence, I borrowed Amy's favorite pen, and...

That pen is her best friend.
I'm not even saying that as an insult.
I've heard her say it.

I have a compstat presentation coming up, and I was toying with the idea of using hand gestures,
For emphasis,
So I went out on the roof to practice...
And, ladies and gentlemen, violent crime has gone down by 10 perce... ♪♪ Slow percussive music...
Amy is going to be very angry, maybe even angrier than when they added "Yolo" to the dictionary.
You know, I wouldn't worry about it.
Amy's, like, physically incapable of being mad at you.
I don't think she'll be disrespectful, but certainly she'll be upset.
Ehh...

Amy, someone lost your pen, girl.
Gina, you better be joking.
That pen is my best friend, and I will straight up...
It was captain Holt.
Oh, that's fine.

It's just a pen.

Hey, so I talked to my C.I.S, and nobody's heard anything about Ocampo,
But I talked to Skeezy J, who said he's been taking night classes.
He wants to be a dietician.

Hawkins knows we're working the case.
I highly doubt it.

She just called and said,
"get over here.

Hmm, so it appears you were onto something.
Very good.

This place is awesome.
I've always wanted to work in a covert facility.
I know.

I bet they have some awesome name for it.
- Welcome to the slaughterhouse.

Hey, so listen,
We know you told us to stop looking for Ocampo, but we figured we'd find him for you,
Try and make things right.
It's all good.

I checked out your files.

I think you might be our best option at finding this guy again.

Can a paring knife remove a human heart in under a minute?

Lucky.
So why don't you both come back tomorrow
And we can start working this together?
And, who knows, if you find the guy,
I got an open spot on my squad.
Maybe one of you could fill it.
Or maybe one of us could fill it.
- Excuse me?

Rosa, leave now?
This is amazing.
I've always wanted to be on that squad.
Me too.

What do we do?
I mean, there's only one spot and the two of us, unless one of us wanted to back off
Because the other said it first.

Look, none of this matters if we don't find Ocampo.
Let's just do our jobs, and Hawkins will do whatever she's gonna do.
Doesn't have to be a competition, right?
- Right.

- Right?

Both:

So based on these phone records, we think Ocampo is definitely still in Brooklyn.
Unrelated question:

- No.

- It's in my jaw.

This is nice work, guys.
Who figured out he was cloning his credit card?
- Oh, uh, couldn't tell you.

- Can't remember.

We don't really keep score.
Yeah, we're super non-competitive.
Great.

How do we find this guy?
I say we tap his brother's phone.
They're tight.

Jake, you agree?
Yes, I think that's a great idea.
Fully support that.

The one thing I will say, though, is, it could take us a while to get a warrant.
And we know he's hard up for cash,
And we also know that's his primary buyer, so we could see what this guy knows.
Both smart suggestions.

- Peralta's.

[fake groan] sorry, it's... muscle spasm.
Whatever.
Diaz, you ride?
- Yeah, I got a supercharged R1.

4-stroke, in-line four with dual overhead cams.
Wow, that's a lot of bike.
I ride a custom-6 l-capacity superbike.
What is that?

- 210.

I also ride motorcycles.
Oh, yeah?

Oh, it's in the shop right now.
Yeah, the torque felt low,
So I was like, "bro, we gots to up the torque."
We all know how it is.
Anyways, I could talk about my steel horse all darn day.
We got work to do.

Sarge, Hitchcock and Scully are out of control.
They got into a fight over the ranch dressing,
And now it's everywhere.
- [grunts]

They've been acting like kids,
So I'm gonna treat 'em like kids.
Ooh, daddy's gonna dish out some daddy discipline.
As a fellow daddy, I approve.
- Stop saying "daddy." - you got it, papa bear.
Hmm, I actually kinda like that one.
Makes me feel strong.
Anyway, I'm gonna take away something they love
Until they stop fighting.
Papa bear punishment.

Boyle!

I'm taking away the thing you love most in the world.
Sitting.
You'll get your chairs back
When you apologize to each other.
Fine.

I ever met you, you bald freak!

Don't you push my desk, you basic bitch!
Guys, enough.

- Freak!

Oh, the ranch.

[grunts] [both grunt]
- Oh!

[muffled sobbing]
Ocampo?
Nah, haven't seen him in months.
I don't know how to reach him.

Then I guess we'll just set up surveillance here full-time.
I'm sure your shady customers will love that.
- Oh, well, i...

I'm gonna count to three.

Okay, fine, he was here this morning, but I didn't buy anything.
Here, he left this number in case I change my mind.
Uh, thank you.
Here you go, Lieutenant.

"Die Hard." nice.
- You like "Die Hard"?

Best franchise ever.
I even have the justin long one on blu-ray.
I saw the fifth one in the theaters.
So did I!

- Was that you?

No, but that would've been a cool coincidence.
I also like "Die Hard."
Really, Rosa?

- The shootouts.

Vague and interesting.
But it's funny 'cause I always thought
Your favorite movies were made by Nancy Meyers.
- Seriously?

- I hate that crap.

So you hate the one starring Diane Keaton and John Wick?
- What was it called again?

- "something has to give"?

- I got ya.

Can I get a trace on this number right away, please?
No need.

We got the warrant for Diaz's Tap.
He called his brother and arranged a meet-up.
It's about to go down.
So it looks like my idea worked after all.
- Did it, though?

Nice job, diaz.
Come on, suit up, everyone.

Sounds good.

Cool idea, but is it the best move tactically?
Yes, it is.

Totally.

So we should probably just share one car over there.
Ah, I bet you floppy foot will loan you his bike.
And yet, I don't want to inconvenience floppy foot.
- Sure he wouldn't mind.

Even so, it's not like we have his keys.
- Uh, look at that.

You found them.

I can't wait to drive this motorcycle that I definitely know how to drive.

Santiago, I've been your co for four years.
By now, you should be able to stand up for yourself, even if that means telling me off.
You're right.
Just say the word, and I will tell you off.
Okay, tell me off about losing your pen.
Oh.

Okay, well, it makes me feel pretty annoyed.
- Good.

I mean, it just really grates my cheese.
Grr!
Oh, Santiago, you're faking.
Faking?

Uh, did you hear that "grr"?
Just admit it.
Okay, fine, I was faking the whole time,
But I only did it because I wanted you to enjoy it.
That ruins it.
I mean, it's supposed to be good for both of us.
It was good.

Yeah, but the whole point is for you to get angry.
Did you even get close?

What about your last co?
- Could he make you angry?

You know what?

Don't tell me.

[panting]
Did you find him?

They already left.

He must've heard us coming or something.
- Did you enjoy your ride over?

Well, maybe you shouldn't have brought up Nancy Meyers.
Oh, okay, I see what's happening.
This is a competition.

- Oh, yeah, we're competing.

And I'm gonna crush you.

Can I please sit on the back of your motorcycle?
- No.

Looks like I'm gonna find out if a motorcycle fits on the subway.
Ugh, I gotta find Ocampo before osa does.
I'm so wound up!

Oh, are you flipping out about Tiandra getting kicked off
- "So you think you can dance"?

Well, you should be.

I know what's happening.

It's too much for me.

My brain wants its fast juice.
Hey.

I'm hiding from Hitchcock and Scully.
I can't take anymore.
They got into a meatball fight at breakfast.
They win.

No way, papa bear.
When Nkolaj and his best friend fight,
I have them do an activity together,
Like a puppy puzzle.

So are you saying we give Hitchcock and Scully a case and make 'em work it together?
No, no, no, we give them...

Now let's go to town on 'em daddy-style.
All right, I need you guys to assemble this jigsaw puzzle for a case I'm working on.
Why do we have to do it together?
- Yeah.

Can't argue with that.
Cooperation instead of punishment.
Damn, Boyle,
That is some advanced level parenting right there.
- I learned from the best...

- Lorelai from "Gilmore Girls."

I guess being a daddy just comes naturally to me.
- [muffled groaning] - die!
- Hitchcock, no!

[grunts] [muffled shouting]
How's it going?
Ah, I noticed your pupils have stopped pulsating.
Yeah, because I found the perfect antidote to your little prank.
Sure, caffeine speeds you up,
But half-and-half slows you down.
Ah, dairy.
[exhales deeply] you made one fatal mistake.
[belches] you forgot how gross I am.
Yep.

I dosed that half-and-half with caffeine.
- Come on!

- Being normal.

- Huh, Skeezy J just called.

No, but he said, "Ocampo's in a warehouse on the corner of Richards and Lefferts."
- Uh...

[gulping, sputtering] [gags]
Yeah, it got all in my mouth.

But still not as bad as water.

What's wrong, Jake?

You know that I am!

[grunts] oh, the half-and-half just met the gasoline.
They're not mixing well.

Sir, are you all right?
I failed you, Santiago.
I want my officers to respect the chain of command,
But I never want anyone to be so terrified of me that they repress basic emotions.

You are not a terrible captain.

No, this is about me and my issues with authority.
