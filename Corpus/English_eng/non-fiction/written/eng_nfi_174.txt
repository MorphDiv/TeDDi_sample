Coulson:

S.H.I.E.L.D. still needs a face.
Keep the title, but when it comes to operations,
I'm calling the shots.
Radcliffe:

Aida 2.0:

And all the answers it holds.

We could just reboot the head ... in a controlled environment ... and then we could diagnose the problem together.
Please!

I'm gonna figure out what broke you.
[Electronic voice] Thank you, Fitz.
Will there be another opportunity to acquire the Darkhold?
Agent May's decoy will be more convincing.
Her programming operates on a subconscious level.
If Agent May isn't aware of her mission to retrieve the Darkhold, then she won't be able to reveal herself.
She'll instinctively climb the ranks, gain access, and get closer to Agent Coulson, the man who knows just where this book is.
[Exhales sharply]
4x11

Coulson:

We're gonna miss you in the field.
I'll catch up.

When this is over, it's time.

You don't have to twist my arm.
I wouldn't dare.

Agent May.
Director Mace ... he ... he knows that Aida is... what Aida is?
- Yeah.

[Sighs deeply]
H-How did he take it?
He wants to use her on this, but concerned.
"Concerned." That's not a happy word.
- Did ...

I don't like those words, either.

I hear you're on your way to personally escort Aida.

Well, no one knows what she can do.
- And she saw the Darkhold.

Once I've studied it, I-I'd be able to determine ...
No.

When this is over, I'm destroying the book myself.
Because it's dangerous, yeah.

You still need access to my apartment.
- Maybe I could, uh ...

[Chuckles] Right, right, right.
Well, I'll reach out to Aida, anyway, tell her to expect you.
Be ready to help solve the current... problem.
- Sure.

[Music] [Beeps]
Aida, I want you to access your information cache.
Locate the Sunset Protocol.
I have it, Doctor.
Activate it.
[Cellphone beeps]
[Doorbell rings, door opens]
Aida 2.0:

Dr. Radcliffe gave me specific instructions.
Happy to help.
Allow me to retrieve the neural-assessment gauge.
What's a neural-assessment gauge?
Ohh.
[Exhales sharply]
[Music]
- I apologize, Agent May.

[Music]
[Device beeps, whirs]
[Computer beeping]
Let's get you up to speed, shall we?
[Tablet beeps]
- What's a neural-assessment gauge?

[Music]
_
[Wind chimes dinging]
[Door closes]
Hope you liked your facial, Melinda.
It's time for your massage.

I don't remember coming here.
You dozed off.

That's good.
Yeah, I don't think I have time for this.

[Wind chimes ding]
[Door opens, closes]
Hope you liked your massage, Melinda.
It's time for your facial.
Look, I-I don't think I want this.

[Wind chime dings]
[Door opens, closes]
Hope you liked your facial, Melinda.
No.
[Gasps, breathing heavily]
[Monitors beeping, alarm blaring]
[Grunting]
[Coughs]
[Choking]
Radcliffe:

[Strained] I knew it wasn't real.
The syringe, Aida.

[Coughing weakly]
You bastard.
We may have misjudged what it takes
[Echoing] to keep Agent May comfortable.
_ [Monitor beeping]
Radcliffe:

Seems to be working.
- You found the solution, Doctor.

Just not a permanent fix.
However, as long as our May replacement at the S.H.I.E.L.D. base does her job, it doesn't have to be.
Question ... why does it matter if the original May is dead or alive?
- Aida?

We have cerebral replication.

No one in S.H.I.E.L.D. knows she's been replaced.
- What empirical difference is there?

We need May alive for calibration ...
- Yes, but I ...

Nathanson was a drastic overadjustment.
But isn't it preferable to sacrifice one life to save millions?
Yes, as a last resort, Aida.

Our May Life Model Decoy should get us the Darkhold eventually.
And if something goes wrong... then we have our safety net.
You're referring to the other android
- now in operation.

[Music]
Coulson:

Talbot:

- Everything has to be aboveboard.

Senator Nadeer will be there.

We're all aware of the dangers, some of us more than others.
I'm fine with it, Jemma.
Are you?

And, Coulson, you're letting her.

With Nadeer and her staff in the meeting,
- we have an opportunity.

I wasn't briefed on any opportunity.
While Nadeer's in with Daisy,
Yo-Yo and I will get into her office and plant surveillance.
Daisy:

- figure out her next move.

No, there'll be no planting, no eyeing, no Yo-Yo-ing.
S.H.I.E.L.D. is now legitimate.

You mean like juicing our Director so he can pretend to be Inhuman?
Look, you are reacting to the situation we had.
You put Jeffrey in place, I understand, but we're S.H.I.E.L.D. We have to be proactive.
This is politics, Phil, which means politicians.
They are a festering cesspool of toxic-waste fires.
You swim in those waters, you could get pulled under.
You and the Director can handle it.
We'll handle the rest.

Always.
[Monitors beeping]
Hmm.

As I said, no reason to even consider harming Agent May.
Very good, Doctor.
[Glass shatters]
Oh, dear.

[Music]
[Glass scratching]
[Breathes deeply]
[Chuckles]
I'm happy Turtleman came out to play this morning.
You.

- It's not a nickname for your ...

- We could find a nickname for it...

...but ... okay. [Chuckles] Me too.
I enjoy you.
- Yeah?

I mean, sure, you're an engineer, and you're smart, and... your insides are great.
But this outside, these arms...
- they don't even seem real.

You're not so bad yourself.
- Not bad?

[Smacks lips]
I'm a knockout.

[Chuckles]
- Want some water?

[Cellphone vibrates]
[Sighs]
[Music]
[Clothing rustles]
Oh, is it time for the mission already?
Uh, no, it's a change of plans.

I'm not gonna be on this one.
I was just covering the communications here, anyway.
I, uh ...

Is that the text you just got?
Yeah.

[Bag thuds]
Look.

I know it's bad timing, but you guys are gonna be fine.
Okay?

- Okay.

[Music]
- May2:

Answers about Aida.
Security report on the incident, need to close it out.
Okay.

How much was Aida aware of what she was going to do before she did it?

This isn't about a security report, is it?
It's about you.
About ordering Aida to read the Darkhold.
Trust me, I was trying to get her to do the same thing, and I'm asking the same questions that you are.
I think you did what you had to do in the moment.
It was a hard choice.
Not when it comes to saving you and Coulson.
No.
That's just how you're built.
[Breathing heavily]
Aah!
Aah.
[Breathing heavily]
[Footsteps approaching]
Radcliffe:

I need to go out for a bit.
There's a situation to which I must attend.
- Shall I drive you?

Doctor, if Agent May does become a problem ...
Oh, I don't see that happening.
[Door closes]
Gentlemen, Agent Mackenzie requested personal time, so he's not with us on this.
Mack or no Mack, I'm urging you to reconsider the second part of this mission.
Which part is the second part again?
- The stupid part.

If she discovers you've launched an unauthorized investigation into her, it's gonna trigger an investigation into you.
There are always consequences.
It's dangerous, but she is dangerous.
And this is our chance to get ahead of it proactively.
- Gentlemen, I'm sure we ...

Half the time, I'm reacting to the steaming pile of fart-pebbles you hand me.
And the other half, you're not giving me the full story.
- We're like the odd couple here.

At the very least, we need a contingency plan.
If she comes after you, she's gonna want
S.H.I.E.L.D. records, S.H.I.E.L.D. assets.
Let me take them to a military facility for protection.
That makes no sense.
Our people are trained to protect those assets.
Until she deposes all of you.
General, the assets belong here.

Nadeer tried to kill several people, including me.
Coulson is right.

Yeah, but you have to say that, don't you?

[Music]
[Grunts]
Aah.
[Electricity crackles]
Perhaps you are gonna be a problem after all.
Hyah!
[Lamp shatters]
[Crash] [Thud]
I like you, Agent May.
I don't wish for you to suffer.
I promise to make this quick and painless.
Thanks.

[Electricity crackles]
[Music]
How're you holding up?

Me?

Okay.
Well, I'm just saying, if you are ...
I mean, it's not my comfort zone, but I'm good.
I'll just tell the truth.

You?
You don't talk much about your childhood, do you?
The foster homes, bouncing around.
I imagine a lot of the time, it felt like you had to perform to convince people to like you.
Only the places I wanted to stay.

Because if you enter every room thinking you got to do a song and dance, eventually everything becomes a performance.
And believe me, I know how it feels putting on an act full-time.
Yeah.

Anyway, I know it's not an act with you.
Coulson's been saying since day one that you're the real deal, and I've learned to trust his read on people, so...
He believed in me before I believed in myself.
You too, you know.
It's why he wants you with us still.

He keeps saying you were trying to do the right thing.
- Oh, you've talked about it, huh?

And listen, with me... sometimes it's...
Sometimes I think it's an act.
You got this.
- Jeffrey, I'm surprised to see you.

Surprised to see him not dead, you mean?
There'll be plenty of time to ask questions after we've started, Ellen.
I expect a lot of questions will be answered in this meeting.
Have fun.
Great.

I think we're gonna find out.

Man:

Agent Daisy Johnson, we'd like to swear you in.
[Camera shutters clicking]
- [Beeps] You're clear, go in.

[Beeps]
- That went well.

So, Mack ... personal time, huh?
Don't put me in the middle of this.
What middle?

It's not for me to say.

All I know about him is what's in his file.
I spent six months on a plane with the guy.
I bet I know less than you.
So maybe something's on his file.
Maybe you should ask him.
[Speaking Spanish]
Well, I don't know about annoying him, but you're starting to annoy me.

Isn't it better to learn things organically instead of all at once in a report?
No, all at once.

Private person, secrets?

Must be even tougher with May.
If it's better to get to know each other
- in tiny, slow, annoying pieces...

...then you two will never get together.
Me and May?
- No.

I don't need to read a file on you two to know.
You know, no one likes a smart-ass.
That hasn't been my experience.
_
[Door opens]
- You and May ready for the op?

Uh, we could always use a fresh pair of eyes if you'd like to join us.
Yeah, no.

Okay.
You know, one of the upsides of having a girlfriend is you get to talk about what's bothering you.
Yeah, well, doesn't really sound like an upside for the girlfriend.
I know you're upset about Aida.

I don't want to intrude on you while you're... processing.
But I also want you to know you can talk to me.
- Always.

Just, uh...
You know I go all quiet when I'm... processing.
Okay.
[Door closes]
[Breathing heavily] [Music]
Daisy:

Being a party to the Sokovia Accords would be very different from being an undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
Well, you'll answer to a different authority ... the public.
Believe me, I've ...

[Light laughter]
- Uh, next up is Senator Nadeer.

Agent Johnson, as an Inhuman yourself, do you feel more responsibility to help Inhumans than normal Americans?
Well, first of all, Inhumans are normal.
Let's be clear about that.
But with regard to whom I'll help, I'm here for all Americans.
But more often than not, Inhumans are left to fend for themselves with few resources.
- So Inhumans cause more trouble.

Inhumans are more likely the victims of hate crimes, which is not fair.

They all deserve help, wherever they may be.
[Camera shutter clicks]
Agent Johnson, let's discuss your theft of more than $7 million from three banks while you were undercover from S.H.I.E.L.D.
Illegally acquired funds going towards illegal activity.
So you say.

The money has been distributed to...
- worthy causes.

So you took the entire justice system into your own hands.
Coulson:

Simmons:

[Music]
Coulson.
Security officers approaching the location.

Okay, they're moving past.

- I was working as a S.H.I.E.L.D. operative ...

Mr. Chairman, this line of questioning ...
And S.H.I.E.L.D. is still doing it.
Coulson:

Hold on.
What the hell just happened?
What's this?

[Whining]
Freeze!

- That's her, the fast one.

- Radio it in.

S.H.I.E.L.D. continues to engage in illegal activity.
That's not true.
- No?

General, moments ago, my people apprehended two S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives breaking in to my office.
Seems they were trying to install surveillance equipment to spy on my staff and me.
Uh, there ... there must be some mistake here.
This Inhuman, Ms. Rodriguez?
She signed the Sokovia Accords, but now she's been caught red-handed in a S.H.I.E.L.D.-sanctioned operation without U.N. approval, just as S.H.I.E.L.D. did with Agent Johnson.
It appears S.H.I.E.L.D. really is a criminal organization after all.
[Music]
[Sighs] That conversation does not look fun.
I have a feeling no conversation with that woman is ever fun.
She knew we'd be there.
Not just any Inhuman.

There has to be a leak.
[Indistinct conversation]
Yeah.

Well, we're all free to go.
Because there's a catch, right?
- Well, maybe a slight ...

There's gonna be a full investigation, starting with a Senate committee hearing.
They may even bring charges.
That's unlikely, so let's all just take a beat ...
Unlikely?

This was the risk in going legit.
No, this was the risk in going after Nadeer.
Couldn't have known she'd be ready for us.
Maybe if somebody had warned you first?
- Guys.

I give you the benefit of my expertise, and you just ignore it.
You're never up front with us, General.
You lied about Taiwan, you lied to us about Jeffrey ...
They kidnapped my son!
And I put Jeffrey in that position because you have too damn much baggage to hold that position yourself.
We have very different styles.

And your style just gave the bad guy all the ammunition she needs to go after us.
- That's not how I see it.

This move just exposed the fact that we have a leak.
Someone tipped Nadeer off we were coming.
You opposed the op.

I believed in you when no one else did, Phil.
No.

S.H.I.E.L.D. only exists because of me.
And maybe that's a mistake.
[Breathing heavily] [Music]
[Door handle rattles] Hello, Agent May.
[Music]
Time to give this up, please.
No.

Very well.
But know that it will not make me happy.
- Oh, no.

Congratulations.

- What is this?

Your journey to escape Dr. Radcliffe's lab, our fight, all of this...

I assure you, you're safe.
We've moved you to another location.
You put this in my head.
Dr. Radcliffe knew the best way to keep you busy was to give you something to fight.
- Something like you.

We're coding more, but we can't keep up with you.
You keep getting through it faster.
I'll wipe your memory and send you through again.
You wipe my memory, but I get better every time?
Yes.

So I'm beating it.
And I'll get out eventually...

In 3, 2, 1...
Oh, dear.

[Monitor beeping]
We don't know what's going on, but someone gave us up.
- The senator had inside information.

It's like Nadeer had eyes inside our...
Our headquarters.
- Hey.

- Yeah, Jemma, okay ...

- You turned it on, didn't you?

Fitz... did you turn on Aida's ocular receptors?
Okay.

I-I-I see where you're going with this,
- and you're not wrong ...

Aida has it inside her head, doesn't she?
- Yeah, but, Jemma ...

Aida hacked our base!

Nadeer knew the details of our mission.
No, that's impossible.
I wasn't in that briefing.

Why on earth would you do this?

You put us all at risk in a hundred ways.
Jemma.

I have a working theory.
I wanted to help you get through this obsession of yours,
- but if you continue to ...

Jemma, it's an investigation.
[Pounding on door]
What the hell did you do to me?
Answer me.

- What tipped you off?

And I got hurt.
Oh, I was worried about injuries, but there wasn't time to...
Tell me, how does it feel?

"How does it feel?" How much of me is me?
Am I even me at all?

I assure you, the real Melinda May is fine.
She's safe and healthy...

I don't care about your assurances.
You had me spy on my own people.
"Your own people"!

Please, believe me, everyone is gonna come out of this all right.
I don't know.

- You're not telling Coulson.

Because you have a mission.

It'll kick in when it's time.
Till then, you won't be able to jeopardize what you need to do.
- What mission?

I didn't want you distracted by such... things.
You can't know when May's memories end and my coding begins.

- You're wrong.

There's enough May in me to do what has to be done.
You can't.

It's programming.
That's why I won't tell Coulson who I am?
Did you program me so I can't tell anyone?
No.

[Music]
There's no reason to resist.

Why don't you simply...

What do you think I want?
Come now.

- You don't know me.

I know what you want, or, rather... whom.
See?

I've seen the closeness between you.

If only May ... and you, for that matter ... could be... happy.
Forget duty and honor and simply take what you want.
You are who you are.
- You're wrong.

But May has no time for happiness.
She's too busy fighting some fight she's already lost in her past long enough to enjoy...
Is that it?

[Door slams open]
Get away from her.
What's ...

You don't talk to him.

Fitz had a theory after Aida betrayed us ... that it wasn't reading the Darkhold that changed her.
That you programmed her to do it.
- He was right.

[Holster clicks]
May?

Something Fitz said got me thinking.

Came to see what he knew.
And the truth came out.
Get him out of here.
- Hey.

How'd the mission go?
Not well.

Well, I'm sure that ...
I'm tired of playing games, Mack.
Coulson said that if I wanted to know where you went today,
I should ask, and he's right.
[Breathes deeply]
Um...
I went to see my ex.
[Sighs]
I-I've been wanting to talk to you about this, and...
- tell you about Hope.

Mm-hmm.
- All right.

No, I've been giving this a lot of thought.
And you know, we go out to dinner, and then you do nothing, and then we do something, and then you go away.
Because I don't take this lightly.
Look, Mack, I like you.

But this...

I don't pry, I don't nag.

That's a...
That's a cliché.
- And I refuse to be a cliché.

So, if you want to be a man that has secrets and goes off and meets other women, that's fine.
But that's another cliché I'm not interested in.
I love that you're not a cliché.
[Sighs]
Hope was my daughter.
And she died.
- Oh, my God.

It's...

My ex, Nicole...

She got pregnant, and we were happy.
But... when Hope was born, it was, uh... it was touch and go... and she only lived for four days.
Her story was over before it ever started.
- Mack, I didn't know...

But tomorrow's Hope's birthday.
And Nicole has a hard time with it.
That's why she texted me.
So I went to see her so she wouldn't be alone.
Maybe I wanted to spend a day remembering Hope, also.
[Sighs deeply]
I've been wanting to tell you that for a while.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mack.
[Music]
Long day.

- Today wasn't great. [Sighs]

Today was a kick in the balls.
You know that won't be the end of it.
Nadeer busted us.

- Talbot's pissed.

Yeah.

I was reckless.

You were protecting your people.
- Yeah, but ...

Who cares?

- Flaws and all.

Yeah.
I am.
[Music]
Fitz!
Oh, Fitz, this has all been a big misunderstanding.
You have to believe me.
- Things just got out of control.

You know, the whole time I was testing my theory, looking into what you did, do you know what I wanted to find more than anything?
That I was wrong.
- I know ...

But it's a pattern.
I almost hoped this time it was my paranoia.
I actually hoped I was paranoid.
[Sighs]
But no.

No, no, Fitz, I didn't want to hurt anyone.
I-I-I wanted to help everyone.
That ...

These people matter to me.
You've got a sociopathic way of showing it.
I don't bond well with actual people.

When you rescued me from Hive, they were ready to lock me up.
You believed in me.

- My mistake.

You've been more than a friend.
- You've been like a son to me.

I get overeager, Fitz.

But I meant well.

Talk to them, Fitz.

[Sighs]
- You're mad.

My only goal is to preserve life.
My first priority, always.
[Music]
Right.
Fitz.

- [Door opens] Wait!

[Gun cocks]
I-I still have feelings.

I've got to hand it to Radcliffe.

[Gunshot] [Grunts]
[Electricity crackles]
[Distorted electronic voice] I still care about you, Fitz.
I still care about you, Fitz.
I still care about you, Fitz.

[Electricity crackling] [Music]
Gonna need some assistance.
- Medical and engineering.

- Looks like you have a problem.

I knew it the moment Aida failed to get the Darkhold
I wasn't safe.

And that's when you first called me.
Seemed prudent, given how exposed I'd become.
I said I needed your protection.

But I won't be the one protecting you.
You'll have to meet the Superior.
Fine.

[Music]
Coulson:

How's our guest?

Aida 2.0:

She's been a model patient, even with the move. [Monitor beeping]
- I tried the scenario you suggested.

Well, an altered memory, but there was enough for me to work with.
I'm easing her pain.
It's working even better than the other programs.
May herself proved to be the key.
Peacefulness wasn't enough.

And fighting wasn't enough.

But once I remembered that she was fighting a fight she'd already lost... all I had to do was change the fight... take her back to Bahrain.
[Music]
[Indistinct chatter]
Did you see that move?
How did she take out that many people?
Had to have been 30 guys.
Man:

- Agent May took them all on.

Andrew:

I did it, Andrew.
Thank you.
I saved the girl.

[Music]
