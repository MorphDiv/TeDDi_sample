Thanks for downloading this fox show.
And don't miss all-new episodes on fox.
Previously on sleepy hollow...
He's lost his connection to our world.
He needs an anchor.
Mom?

Mr. crane?
If you could tell him anything, what would you say?
Don't ever give up hope.
Hope, hope, hope...
What did you hear?
Molly's voice.
I sold my soul to the devil.
It's a tactic a lot of people at the top of the pyramid use.
Play the odd bird.
Hide your true intentions.
I've located the map of the ley lines.
The wellsprings where their power converges.
Someone is procuring mystical artifacts.
Where are we with the next talisman?
Still tracking it.
All these lovely puzzle pieces.
Do you want the pain to stop?
Do you want to purge the guilt weighing you down in that chair?
Brother, all of your burdens will be lifted by the power of the everliving rock.
Yes, yes.
My god.
I can feel my legs.
Now remember, only those who give, and give generously, shall receive.
Hallelujah!
Hurry up.
I got a date.
Now, that's a miracle.
Pouring it on a little thick with the hug, don't you think?
Worked, didn't it?
Next show is at 9:00.
Don't be late again.
You don't even realize what you have, do you?
Whoa, whoa.
You... you shouldn't be in here.
We're closed.
Mortals... so focused on their petty desires.
Never seeing...

Back off there, bud.
Never recognizing when they're in the presence...
Of true power.
Can I get an amen?
Power can be lost, go missing for centuries, then turn up in the unlikeliest of places.
But in the end...
Power can never remain hidden.
Not to those deserving enough to wield it.
You are not deserving!
Malcolm, I've secured the third talisman.
I'll see you in the morning.
"Don't fight the pain.
"Surrender to it."
You told me that once.
Remember?
I learned so much from you and your friends in hell.
Time to put those lessons to use.
The third-century celts were the most fearsome and bloodthirsty warriors in all britannia.
Savage to their barbarian hearts, they laid waste to all who challenged them, including one Danish prince foolish enough to cross hadrian's wall.
He was defeated, of course...
And decapitated.
The Celtic chieftains allowed their men to lustily kick his head around for enjoyment.
And from these gruesome origins grew the sporting endeavor you modern-day warriors refer to...
As soccer.
Cool!

What did they do with the head after?
Did they empty his brains before they played?
And what about the eyes?
Did they pop out when they kicked it?
- Most likely.

Say, "thank you, Mr. crane."
Thank you, Mr. crane.
To a swift victory, team Bumblebee.
Well, that was a spirited, rousing match.
Not as spirited as your cheering.
What was that we were shouting?
"Creep, creep"?

That's the sound of a white-breasted nuthatch at the rite of spring in the colonies.
Common expression of adulation in my day.
Guess that one didn't stick.
And we are all the poorer for it.
Hi, Mr. crane.
Miss Molly is quite the competitor.
Far and away the most gifted of her teammates.
Yeah, she's always been athletic.
She was the most coordinated baby in day care.
Is that because she's a witness?
No, no.
It does not quite work like that.
Being a witness does not Grant one special powers or skills.
A witness is no different from any other person.
Except that they're a monster magnet.
Well, d... not exactly.
In the war between good and evil, the witnesses will always be drawn to the site of conflict in order to...
Witness it.
What we do at that conflict is entirely up to us.
The lieutenant and I chose to battle the forces of darkness.
Miss Molly...
May choose an entirely different path.
But in order to do that, she must first know who she is.
I know.
I just haven't figured out how to tell her yet.
I never had a chance to be father to my son.
Just to sit with him and have...
An honest moment.
I was reminded of this during my recent ordeal.
And it filled me with regret once again.
Malcolm dreyfuss.
Enrolled at Stanford at the age of 15.
Dropped out to launch a start-up in his parents' garage.
Made his first billion at the age of 30.
Certified genius.
Every supernatural encounter we've had leads back to dreyfuss.
The Lincoln memorial.
Dreyfuss enterprises had a contract to restore the statue before Lincoln's head went missing.
The dyer house.
Dreyfuss had applied for permits to drain the swamplands around it.
Plus he had the banneker folio, which led us to j street, where the despair creature was trapped.
So he's doing all this to collect mystical artifacts?
To do what?
That is what we must determine.
Master Wells, you say you saw his man procuring an item from the Smithsonian.
"Procuring" is the nicest way of saying he incinerated a security guard while demonically trashing a storage room.
That guard is officially a missing person.
It gives us grounds to question dreyfuss.
Very good.

Whilst agent Thomas and I have a chat with Mr. dreyfuss, perhaps you could divine what it was he sought from the Smithsonian.
You are, after all, our artifacts expert.
I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but...
He was talking to me.
Yeah, I knew that.
Mr. dreyfuss is just wrapping up a presentation for our young entrepreneurs program.
It's so inspiring how much he gives back.
It's... n... w...

Will you please put the...

Right here.

Right at where the c... code stops and the bug isn't there...

We got to tear all this down.

Did you try g-d-b?
See there?

Is that...

We... we got it!
Thank you.
That right there, that...
Was the precise moment that my company was born.
And in that moment I had all the skills and all the knowledge I needed for success, but the thing is...
I needed ansel... to show me how to harness it all.
See, ever since we were kids...
He was the one with all the confidence.
It was ansel's idea to film all that in the first place.
Even back then, he was convinced we were... making history.
And ansel...
Ansel continues to teach me every day.
He reminds me that our time here can always be cut tragically short.
Not one of us knows when this ride is gonna end.
Right?
So...

What are you gonna do on your ride?
Thank you for coming.
Welcome to dreyfuss enterprises.
Please pull all the way in.
Sorry,
I don't have you on my log today.
Excuse me, sir.
Hey.
Do we have a problem?
Dispatch, this is the loading...
Dude, help me out.
That could refer to so many aspects of your life.
Help you out with what?
Dude, hamsters learn faster than you.
She's not into you.
Well, that's because...
She doesn't know me.
But if someone were to pave the way...
If someone would let her know how chill I am...
Good luck finding that someone.
Lunch for the rest of the month.
And your parking space.
Deal.

I found the museum inventory that you wanted, but there's no way of telling which piece that dreyfuss took.
Not from the inventory alone, but if you match it up with the bills of lading from the last month, you can figure out what was delivered...

That's sharp.
You'd have to hack into the database of every carrier that delivers to the Smithsonian.
Three down, five to go.
We could divide and conquer.
Cool.
Cool.
I've been using dos attacks.
I'm more of an sql injection girl myself.
What's with him?
I'm supposed to be talking him up to you.
I know.
I've already told him, but I'm getting a month's worth of lunches out of this.
Really?
Do you want me to cut you in?
No.
Just flash him a smile.
A security guard from the Smithsonian disappeared from his shift three nights ago.
An eyewitness put this man at the scene.
Yes, that would be jobe, my bodyguard.
Jobe... is that his last name?
You know, I never asked him that.
May we speak with him?
Well, at the moment, he happens to be on a special assignment, and I'm afraid he insists on keeping his own schedule, but all things considered, I have to say jobe is well worth his quirks.
Yes, I imagine your own personal demon can come in quite handy.
Mr. crane...
I hope it's okay if I call you ichabod.
That name...
Just tickles me to no end.
Please.
Now, if I were to say
I have any idea.
Wha...
What in the world you're talking about, why would I discuss any of this with you?
Because there is no victory for you without a gallery.
Which is why you told us you'd sold your soul to the devil.
That's right.
A jest.
Bit of mischief.
And now you're collecting powerful artifacts to perpetrate more evil...

Yes, now, that, that...
That does sound like me, yes.
Leveraging assets.

Innocent lives be damned.
No.
No.

Not at all.
Unless you think you...
Have lived an innocent life...
Ichabod.
Sorry, Mr. dreyfuss, but we have a situation.
If you'll excuse me.
What?

We've had a breach.
He disabled the security protocols and gained entrance.
He disabled the secur...

Locked out.

What are you doing?

What's going on?
Security breach.
Secure all data and restricted areas.
Security breach.
Secure all data and restricted areas.
Someone put the building in lockdown.
My god.
What happened in there?
Ansel.
Ansel, your former partner?
Your dead partner?
You need to tell us what's going on, right now.
If he wanted to kill you, he would not have announced his presence.
He's taunting you.
Daring you to come after him because he has what you want.

What is the artifact?
What are you collecting?

I don't know what he...
I don't know what he wan...
Yes?
We're ready, sir.
Okay, good.

No matter what you have to do, make sure he doesn't get out.
Yes, sir.

Judging by the appearance of the victims, ansel is clearly wielding dark magic.
Your men do not stand a chance against him.
Hazards of the job.
But no one...
Forced these gentlemen to sign up to be security guards.
Listen, you're...
You're free to wait it out here.
You know, it's the safest place in the building.

No.
We will not stand idly by whilst innocent men suffer for your sins.
Wait, what do you mean you're trapped?
The building's been sealed off, which means everyone in here is at the mercy of a violent and deranged warlock.
The dreyfuss building's network is like a tank.
There's no way to break through.
I got it.

Okay, well, not exactly.
Their admin encryption is military-grade, but I was able to get us access into the lower-level systems, which is mostly maintenance stuff, but it's a foot in the door.
We're working on getting you out of there.
Just stay safe until we do.
That might not be up to us.
We're too late.
Agent Thomas.
He's in the infrastructure.
Here's what I hacked from their security cam memory banks.
Hold on.

So, when he chants a spell, it activates those markings on his skin.
And those just aren't any markings.
Those are sigils.

Yeah, demonic symbols...

Sigils are usually recorded in occult texts, they're not branded onto people's skin.
Yeah, because once you access a sigil, it burns itself out.
I can't imagine what happens if it's on your body.
I'm gonna look into how to combat sigil magic, okay?
Crane, those men back there...
Yes. 'Twas a grim sight.
I can't expose Molly to this.
If homeland security can't handle it, how is my ten-year-old daughter supposed to?
No.
Greek fire.
It ignites a flame so voracious it can never be extinguished.
Crane?
He's going to destroy the entire building.
Hello, Malcolm.
Ansel?
Is it really you?
Thank god.
It's a miracle, my friend...

You've gotten overconfident.
Your security algorithms are for crap.
You used to be better than that.
I am...

And I think we both know
I have always been better than you.
Yes.
You were the better coder and engineer.
But you couldn't leave it at that.
You still had to find a way to get rid of me.
Because it was always, always about you, ansel.
No one ever took me seriously when you were around.
It just didn't seem to matter to anyone that I was...

I was the brains behind...
Everything.
All they wanted was to...

And now...
Look at my face.
You should have just had me killed.
Death would have been a relief.
Instead, you banished me to a circle of hell where every day a new demon burned their name into my flesh.
Took pleasure at my agony.
But I escaped.
Made it back to this world.
Studied what each of these scars meant and how to use them.
So my pain...
Is now my power.
What do you want?
I want my life back.
You have the other pieces.
I want them.
Drop him!
You both should want him dead.
What happens after you kill him?
You bring down the entire building with everybody in it?
We found the Greek fire.
What good is killing him if I allow what he's built to survive?
Agent Thomas!
Go!

Is there another way out?
No.

I've locked out the controls.
That'll not hold him for long.
He's come this far;

Here.
All right.

I can't reach Diana or crane.
That's not good.

I got it.

So, sigils are symbols that are activated by saying a spell, right?
Now, what if you could sever the symbol from the spell?
That, of course, led me to John Dee, who specialized in hermetic languages.
And I don't even have to tell you,
Jake?

Focus.

This goes all the way back to the tower of babel.
It's like a shutdown command.
So if someone recites this while the warlock is activating a sigil...

Okay, we just need to find a way to get this phrase to crane.
But how?

Okay, well, we have access to all of the maintenance systems, right, including ventilation.
Right.

All the outside vents are closed.
Well, what if tell the system that the air supply has been used up?
Then it would have to switch into backup mode and vent air from the outside.
Wait-wait, you're going in through the air duct?
Yup.

Why?

Actually, I could really use your help monitoring the situation from here, you know, in case we need any more info on the sigils.
You're the expert, right?

Thank you.
What happened?
Your pulse is strong, but you may have internal injuries.
Listen...
If I don't make it...
Tell Molly...
If she keeps hanging out with that snotty girl Erica, she'll end up with a lower-back tattoo and a life full of regret.
That sounds rather like a conversation for mother and daughter.
There's so much I should tell her.
I just don't know how.
What kind of mother does that make me?
Agent Thomas, you are an excellent detective and an intrepid soldier, but most of all...
You are a superior parent.
I have no doubt when the time comes to tell Molly, you will find the words.
Your misgivings are quite unfounded, for you are governed by one law:
Truth.
And with you by her side, Molly shall never know fear...
Nor apprehension.
Quite the pep talk.
Ever thought of coaching youth soccer?
Oof.

I think some of these might help us hold him off.
Or we could give him these.
These are what he seeks, after all, are they not?
No, no, no, we...
We can't let him have these.
Why?
What are they, and why does he want them?
Okay, first of all, you got to understand what it was like when we were first starting out, when we were just... just beginning to launch our company.
Right away, ansel, he...
He became the face of the company.
And I became his shadow.
And he never sought out the attention, but...
That just made things worse.
It was all my work.
It was all my work...

But no one ever saw that.
All they saw was ansel.
I decided I would make them see.
I took possession of everything.
All my work... every program, every circuit, everything.
Of course, I knew the investors, they'd file suit to get everything back, but at that moment...
It didn't matter.
Because something was telling me to do this.
Something or someone.
What do you want?
No...
No, no, no, no, no, no, that's my life.
Please.
That's my life.

Give me my life back.
I've often wondered wh-what it was about that particular moment.
Were those woods in some sort of mystically charged area or something?
That night I made a request.
And I got an answer.
No.

Who are you?
A messenger.
This is a c... c-contract?
For what?
For the life you were meant to have.
"As...
Payment, signee agrees to..."
"Surrender his soul upon... death"?
A-and if I...

No, no, no.
No, no, no.
What about ansel?
You won't have to worry about him anymore.
I'll see that he's taken care of.
I never asked for anything bad to happen to ansel.
You had no need.
You knew that your unholy alliance would lead to his grisly demise.
Yeah.
And I have a feeling I'm gonna pay for it.
In ways we can't begin to imagine.
You were trying to renege on your deal.
You received everything you desired, and now you realize you don't want to sacrifice your soul, so you're trying to cheat your way out of it, aren't you?
How?
Finally.
Where is the last piece?
I don't have it.
I swear to you
I don't have it.
The stone's transformative powers can only be activated if it is whole... only then can my life be restored.
So I must have the last piece.
What is this stone?
How can it do as you say?
He hasn't told you?
This is the philosopher's stone, the most powerful magical item ever known to man.
It can transmute all the pain
I have suffered and give me back my life.
And this time...
It will be life eternal.
The philosopher's stone.
You were going to cheat out of your deal by cheating death itself.
If I never die,
I never have to lose my soul.
More tricks and games.
That comes to an end now.
Tell me where the last piece is.
Graupha keph pai!
Machis nach med tal!
I'm all right, all right.
Crane!
The Greek fire.
There are other paths to eternity.
Nice throw.
Nice catch.
Where is dreyfuss?
He's gone.
And he's taken the philosopher's stone.
How are the quesadillas coming?
Not bad.
Here.

I like them crunchy.
Yours.
How bad did you hurt yourself?
The doctor said workout injuries like this, um, they're not so bad.
Be better in a few days.
Baby, I got to talk to you about something.
You know Mr. crane?
Yeah.

Yeah, he is awesome.
He's also special.
What do you mean?

Yeah.

And it's bigger than the marines.
It has to do with...

He's been specially selected.
And we think you have been, too.
Me?
Selected by who?
We don't really know.
Well, what's the mission?
It's about making the world a better place.
You and Mr. crane are what's known as witnesses.
Witnesses.
What does that mean?
It means a lot of people are gonna be counting on you.
And you're gonna do great things.
When you called me and asked me to talk to Mr. crane, to tell him that he was important and to have hope, was that part of the mission?
Yeah, it was.
So, how'd I do?
You did really well.
You helped him when he really needed it.

I like Mr. crane.
And I want to help people, like you do.
That's how you got hurt.
You didn't get hurt working out.
You got hurt stopping bad people from doing bad things.
Mom, you can always tell me the truth.
Okay.
You have a deal.
That's a relief, 'cause...
There's something I got to tell you.
Burnt quesadillas suck.
Yeah.
All right.
Grab us some drinks.
Okay.
Witnesses.
So... there's no sign of dreyfuss.
Nope.
No reports of him anywhere.
But I guess if you're a billionaire and you want to stay hidden, you stay hidden.
Yeah, well, at least he doesn't have the last piece of the philosopher's stone.
Yeah, but for how long?
By the way,
I finished cross-checking the Smithsonian inventory.
Found out what dreyfuss took from there.
"Diagrammatical plottings of geoglyphs,
Alfred Watkins, 1925."
Alfred Watkins...

You know, pioneered the mapping of...

Alignments of mystical energy that circle the earth.
What would dreyfuss want with a map of ley lines?
This is a scan I made of the blavatsky map.
It shows all of the major ley lines in north America.
Does this look anything like what dreyfuss' demon took from the storage room?
No.

Okay.
Yeah, it was more like that.
What are these?
Convergence points.

Wait.
Pull up a, current GPS map of the D.C. area.
This is the Lincoln memorial.
And this is where we found the dyer house.
George Washington hid the philosopher's stone pieces on the strongest ley line intersections.
Presumably, that's where we'll find the last piece.
Whoa.

Of course.
What?

Sleepy hollow.
thanks for watching fox on demand.
And don't miss all-new episodes, only on fox.
- I'm an engineer.

I am a billionaire.
I will upgrade the police to the best technology money can buy.
Long story short, we're gonna change the world.
I have a proposal.
Give me the 13th district.
Technology doesn't solve cases.
- Cops do.

Fantastic.
What the hell was that?
Wow.
This is the good part.
