Barry:

To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,
I was accidentally thrust into the future, and I saw him murder the woman that I love.
But I won't let that happen.
I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future, and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.
I am The Flash.
Previously on "The Flash."
I'm free!
- Who are you?

I can't spend the rest of my life wondering if I'm gonna become Killer Frost.
I understand the real reason that you invited me on this team.
You just want your own meta-human specialist to try and find you a cure.
- That's not the only reason.

I'm Cisco, by the way.

- You're into me.

I'll marry that woman.
Iris West, will you marry me?
Yes.
[both laughing]
Looks like we may need to find a new job.
Heard Stagg Industries may be getting bought out.
By who?
Doesn't really matter now, does it?
All I know is we got millions of dollars of tech... like whatever that thing is... that no one's using.
Then surely you gentlemen won't mind if I abscond with some of it.
This piece in particular.
How did you get in here?
Believe me, that's the least impressive of my tricks.
Hands up, pal
Do it now, or I'll shoot.
Stop!
How the hell did he do that?
[alarm blaring]
Maybe you can figure out how I did it, but...

Aw, thank you.
Barry, your grandfather had really good taste in jewelry.
- Mm-hmm.

Okay, so, break it down.

Um... we were at the apartment, and, um,
- Barry sang to me.

And then he proposed.
Oh, my God, that's so romantic.
- You sing?

Shut up, Barry.
Well, okay, that reminds me, my sister has four tickets that she can't use...

On the house.

Uh, yeah, we're interested.

First weekend in July.

Um...
No, that works great.
We'll be there, all of us.
Don't!

Please?

You lose, Barry.
No!
[dramatic music] [sighs]
Well, everything's the same.
The future has not changed.
All right.

Okay, well, we should approach this the same way we approach any other problem... start with what we know.
Problem can't be solved if it's not understood.
Therein lies the rub.

It's like Savitar's prophecies.
Precisely, and just like the newspaper headlines.
Well, all bar one.
[phone ringing]
It's a crime scene.

- Stagg Industries?

Hey, Julian, before you go, there was an envelope delivered for you from the Central City Opera.
Yes, you'd mentioned that you'd never gone before, so... well, I got them for us a while back, but now... just go with whoever you'd like.
Huh.
Looks like things between you and Julian are a little frosty, huh?
It's too soon for the cold puns?
- Yeah.

He still doesn't trust me after I lied about taking a piece of the Philosopher's Stone.
You did what you felt you needed to do to get rid of your powers.
I know that and you know that, but he...
He'll come around.

I don't know that he will, Cisco.
[camera clicking]
Hey, Bar.

[clears throat] Nothing yet.
How the hell did this thing get filled with water and those poor dudes get trapped in here?
Beats me.
There's no water access in the entire wing.
Instead of sprinklers, every floor uses a halon gas system that absorbs all the oxygen if there's a fire.
[sighs] What about the security cams?
None of them either.
Apparently, the Stagg geniuses don't want any of their "secrets"
- to get out.

Julian, please tell me you found something.
Nothing yet, Detective.
No fingerprints, no DNA, just two rather plump looking corpses.
What about the stolen tech?
Nothing.

Everyone is incredibly tight-lipped about it.
Of course they are.

Okay.

This is the last thing we need to be dealing with right now.
I feel the same way, but we can't just do nothing.
Iris ain't gonna let us get away with that.
I know, Joe, but we're running out of time.
That's why you and me need to solve this case fast.
Yeah.
Sometimes...

Yeah, I know.
Hold on.

He calls himself Abra Kadabra.
As in hocus pocus?
He's certainly got a lot of tricks.
Yeah, we think he has some sort of nanotechnology built into his body... allows him to do some extraordinary feats.
Teleportation, telekinesis, you name it, and believe me, I have seen it all.
So that card trick he played on Barry, the water tank at Stagg, that's all some futuristic tech that he's masking as magic?
Well, it's Arthur C. Clarke's third law.
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is...
Both: "indistinguishable from magic."
Before you showed up, he said he was from the future.
The future?
He is, 64th Century.
Great, another criminal from the future.
Haven't we had our fill of those guys?
64th Century.
What exactly are you after him for?
He's at the top of the collectors' most wanted list.
Showed up on my Earth a few years back, did a string of robberies that ended with a lot of people losing their lives.
Showed up again a couple weeks ago, looted some tech companies, came here.
To do the same thing?

He must have needed our Earth's tech for something.
Well, whatever it is, we can definitely help you figure it out, 'cause I don't know about you guys, but ever since last time you were here,
I've been looking forward to some Gypsy vibe action.
- That's way too much.

Yeah, I just want to catch him so I can bring his ass back to Earth-19 and put him down.
Don't worry.

We should check and see if Julian's gotten anything.
I'll go ask him.
In the meantime, we can figure out where this guy disappeared off to.
- Lend me a hand?

I know that look.
What is going on inside that head of yours?
[sighs]
This guy knew what was going on with you and me and Savitar.
If he knows something about Savitar, then...
He might be the key to saving you.
This is the first real lead we've gotten.
But, guys, what about Gypsy?

Upon further inspection, there was some rather odd particulate residue found at Stagg Industries.
Yeah, that's the nanotechnology that Gypsy was talking about.

Not exactly sure.
It's definitely organic, but it seems to have some sort of metallic hydrogen properties.

No, we cannot.

He killed a lot of people on Earth-19.
He's killed people here too.
No one you know or care about.
Did he take somebody from you?
Hey.

You're good to go.
[footsteps approaching]
Thank you.
We're gonna figure this out, Barry.
A guy like Kadabra, he should have no say whether you live or die.
How do you even know that he's telling the truth?
I mean, he's done nothing but tricks since he got here.
I mean, maybe... maybe this is one of them.
It's not, Iris.
So... what, you want to let him go?
[sighs]
I mean, it just feels like our only move.
He's a murderer.
[scoffs] I know he's a murderer, but I mean, how many murderers we put in prison?
How many bad guys have we taken down?
I mean, don't we deserve one win after everything that we've done?
Life doesn't keep score, Barry.
You should know that better than anyone.
Look, even if Kadabra hadn't showed up, we'd still be in the same place we are right now.
But he did, and if he knows who Savitar is, he's gonna tell us.
