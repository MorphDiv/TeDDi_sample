HELEN:

[LAUGHS]
MAN: [ON TV] Police in Polesford are continuing their search for the missing schoolgirls, Poppy Johnston and Abigail Toms.
- Shit.

Suspect's wife, I know her.
She was my best friend.
I'm gonna have to go to Polesford.
All right, I'll get them to endorse access to Linda Bates, but no stepping on anyone's toes.
We're gonna be granddads.
- Come here!

HELEN:

You know, seeing Linda.
Two girls?

WOMAN: [ON TV] Abigail's burnt remains were discovered in woodland yesterday.
Poppy Johnston is still missing.
So, let me guess, coppers?
How's the holiday in murder town?
GAVIN:

HELEN:

Yeah, every day.
So...
Is it mine?

*IN THE DARK* Season 01 Episode 02 Title: "Episode #1.2"
[PANTING]
HELEN:

It wasn't deserted then.
We used to go crazy in those cornfields, when I was younger.
Getting off with boys.
Fumbling around like we knew what we were doing.
And this is relevant, is it?
- To you being pregnant with my kid?

- Ah, come on.

If you just wait.
Fine, tell me the story.
It's what I do, Adam.
Sabotage my life.
You know, you'd think I was unhappy, but maybe it was the opposite.
Maybe I was just terrified of the happiness I was feeling.
Does he know about us?
What do you think?
- How about I tell him?

Then how about I tell the rest of the force, 'cause that'll go down well, shagging your colleague's girlfriend.
You'll be trusted undercover.
Helen, I didn't come here to have a scrap with you.
I came here because...
Yes, to talk to you about the baby.
But, also to say that if it is mine, and I reckon there's a pretty high chance it is, don't you?
That I want to be a part of its life.
And I want to be a part of yours.
MAN:

While I commend Detective Inspector Cornish and his team for their excellent work on this tragic case, we must not lose sight of the fact that there is an inquiry still ongoing.
So, Poppy's parents, Michael and Annette, are going to make a short statement, after which I will be happy to answer any questions.
Stephen Bates has persistently refused to tell the police where our daughter is.
So today, we are appealing to anyone who might know anything, to please come forward and help police find Poppy.
She has been missing for five days now and we are desperate to hear from her.
Poppy is only 16 years old, and it's completely out of character for her to leave home without telling us.

All I'm saying is just go home.

- [MOBILE RINGS]

- What's wrong?

[SIGHS] Stephen Bates tried to kill himself.
Right.

- [SIGHS]

Right, I got to go.

You what?

Ring a cab.
- I don't have a number.

[SIGHS]
You need to tell him, about us and about the baby.
And you need to decide what future you want.
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]
Hey.
- He got hold of a ballpoint pen.

Tried to do his wrists.
[SIGHS] Is he all right?
No one will talk to me.

No one will tell me anything.
Looks like he was trying to take the easy way out, doesn't it?
That's what they'll say, isn't it?
They'll say that in the papers.
[SNIFFS] Mmm-hmm.
[SOBBING]
[MONITORS BEEPING]
SOPHIE:

I admit, it doesn't exactly scream innocence.
[SIGHS] Right now, the entire country thinks he's a child killer.
How do you think that feels?
[SIGHS] Pretty terrible.
Yeah, especially if it's not true.
Thought you'd been warned off.
Cornish told me he told you to go home.
Yeah, I have.
Helen, people's careers can get ruined by stuff like this.
Is she really worth it?

VOICEMAIL:

JENNY:

- [SIGHS]

PAUL:

Why don't you meet me in the pub in a bit?
Paul, we need to talk.
Paul, I've got to tell you something.

[SIGHS] I really messed up, Paul.
And, uh...
I really hope this baby is yours but...
[SIGHING]
Look who it is, Linda Bates' girlfriend.
- Fucking rug-muncher.

- Murdering bitch.

- Shut your mouth.

We don't give a shit.

All right, this is intimidation.

[SPITTING]
[SIGHS]
PHIL:

- Phil, what...

What...

Oh, not the countryside as such, just everyone in it.
[LAUGHS]
And how often do you find out that one of your best friends is having a...?
Cause for celebration.
I demand champagne immediately.

I'd love to.
Hey.
- [CHUCKLES]

Hell on Earth.
So, I popped in to see the coroner.
- And, I saw her body.

Well, let's say the guy must have liked me.
I have a certain charm.
MAN: [ON TV] Outside East Derbyshire Hospital, where, we've been informed, Stephen Bates has been admitted.
TREVOR:

Tried to top himself, couldn't live with it.
Looks like they've got their man.
So, how was the body?
Not a lot left of her, to be honest.
Most of the skin had been removed by insect invasion.
- HELEN:

- Looks like I have an admirer.

PHIL:

PAUL:

Front and centre.
- Tell us about the PM report.

What about time of death?
Three weeks, give or take.
And this is where our creepy crawlies come in.
Three different types of insect were found in the remains.
Yes, I know.

PAUL:

Right.

Time for a tinkle.
- Phil!

O ye of little faith.
- [SNIFFS] - [LAUGHS]
[KNOCKS ON DOOR]
Hi, Dad, Syd.

Oh, my God.
You've got a gay dad, how fantastic.
- [LAUGHS]

Come in.
PAUL:

- Nice to meet you.

PHIL:

[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]
Here you go.
Ah, nice and cold.
ROBERT: [MUMBLING] Piercings...
I could never have piercings.

PHIL:

- If you have it in the right place.

Interesting job you got.
Oh, yeah, hanging out with dead people all day.
Yes, well, it pays very well, but the conversation is often lacking.
[LAUGHS] Well it's amazing what they can do now, with all this tech.
I suppose, you've got to be smart these days, to be a criminal.
Nah, you just need a detective with a massive ego who is happy to bang up the wrong person.
- [DOG HOWLING]

- It's been a long day.

- The party's just getting started.

Have fun.
- Night.

[SIGHS]
Right, let's crack out the poppers.
[ALL LAUGH]
SYD:

[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]
[SOBBING]
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]
- What do you think is going on?

But I think it's got something to do with this place.
I mean, who leaves and never comes back?

Her father lives here.

Yes.

[GRUNTS]
Bollocks.
God love the countryside.
[CHUCKLES]
PHIL:

Like, nothing like four weeks.
How do you make a body that's actually relatively fresh look as though it's been rotting for a while?
Well, never mind how.
Why?
Well, to falsify the time of death, I imagine.
And in that case, why burn the body?
I was hoping you'd have an answer.
Well, it's just a theory, but uh...
To open it up.
I think he burned the body just enough to open it up.
For what?
To put the bugs in.
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]
[CROWD CLAMOURING]
[CROWD SHOUTING]
OK, so I'm him.

That'd be a hell of a twist, but, let's go with it.
I burn the body.
Open up the skin, expose the muscles, organs, whatever.
Yeah.

- Job done.

- with Stephen Bates' DNA all over.

Wherever you managed to acquire that from.
Maybe I followed him, watched him drop it in the gutter.
Thanks, love.
PHIL:

Right, so, where does he get them all from?
All these flies, maggots, different kinds of beetles.
- Internet.

Er, dark web, Bitcoin?
Normal people don't know to use that.
- I do.

[CAR HORN BEEPS]
- Thought it was you.

He's a colleague of mine from Manchester.
What, you're bringing the whole force down?
You know, this used to be a nice town before all this.
Now all we got are pigs and hacks everywhere.
Ah, he seems like a nice chap.
You really ought to get us together for dinner sometime.
Yeah, but he's right though, isn't he?
What are we doing here?
Well, you're here for Helen.
I'm here to escape a large Nigerian man named Reuben who seems to think we're in a relationship.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
Are we being followed?
Relax.
- How's Stephen?

He's out of hospital.
They still won't let me see him, though, or the kids.
Ah, it's killing them.
I know.
They shouldn't have to go through this, 'cause it's hard for them to accept this hate towards him.
It's the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
Is it?
The worst?
I feel so guilty, Linda, for leaving.
- It was a long time ago.

That's shit.
You had the chance and you got out and you...
God, if I'd had that same chance, I would have done exactly the same.
I thought you'd hate me.
I was scared to death, coming down here.

- Yes?

Sorry for staring.

I'm sorry, we're in the middle of something here, private, so...
Oh, I just wanted to say, Linda,
I know who you are, and I understand.
- Thank you.

I appreciate it.
- Which paper are you from?

- [GASPS]

- All right.

Last chance before I really hurt you.

[STAMMERING] The Post.

- to tell your side of the story!

Why don't you get out of here, before I shove those stupid glasses up your bony, tabloid arse.
[GROANS]
[SIGHS]
Scum.
- [EXHALES] - [CHUCKLES]
[BOTH LAUGH]
[LAUGHING]
[CHUCKLING] "Bony, tabloid arse."
You're a good friend.
Oh, and...

We were both victims.
But...
It was because of me.
- He got to you through me.

We were 13 years old.
We were little girls.
[PANTING]
Adam knows.

HELEN: [ON PHONE] If it's not me that tells Paul, it's going to be ten times worse.

Who told Adam?
This prick at work, Mickey.
JENNY: [ON PHONE] Well, how does he know?
He's the one who drove me to the hospital.
Jen, I'm going to tell him tonight.
- No, no, no, no.

If it all blows up,
I'm going to need somewhere to stay for a few days.
Yeah, of course, but you are gonna tear your life apart, throw everything away, and he doesn't need to know.
God, you're gorgeous.
I'm trying to belch.
Yeah, I know.

So, where are you taking me tonight then?
I thought we'd try this new vegetarian place.
- Green Tomato.

Town famous for its pork and you want to go veggie?
- [CHUCKLES]

I mean, isn't it a bit rude to leave him back with your dad and Syd?
No, it's Phil.
He'll be fine.
PAUL:

He's got a brain the size of a planet.
He thinks it's all about the insects, does he?
Yeah.

Placed inside the body.
It would require some pretty specialist knowledge.
I mean, let alone where you'd actually acquire them from.
A layman just wouldn't know that stuff.
Shit.
- Pig farms.

The killer wouldn't need to buy the bugs, he could harvest them.
Right, I spent some time on farms growing up.
What happens when you let an animal corpse decompose?
Flies, they feed on it and they lay their eggs.
And that is when the beetles and the maggots make their appearance.
Oh, shit.
That's it.
That weird farmer, the guy in the bar, accusing everyone of stealing his piglets.
Mad Bob, right.

- What about dinner?

Ah, pigs.
- PHIL:

I say pigs, I mean sausages.
BOB:

So, uh, why don't we have, uh, guide pigs?
We could, easily.
Sniffer pigs?
OK, right, OK, we're getting off topic.
Erm, can we ask you some questions about the piglet that you think was stolen.
Don't think.

Didn't just disappear into thin air, did it?
Want a description?
Oh, no.

Know what a saddleback looks like?
Thought not.

And you say it happened overnight, yeah?
BOB:

Gone the next morning.
You don't have electric fences?
- Anything like that?

Have I seen you somewhere before?
Er, yeah, yeah, at the pub.
You came in accusing Trevor, the landlord.
Could be him, easy.

And that cook he's got, Shelley.
Cut price bloody Shakespeare.
If he's such a good poet, why is he cooking sausages?
Yes.

So, um, how do you handle them being, you know, slaughtered.
[CHUCKLES] Love 'em?

Somebody steals my pigs, it's like mugging me in the street.
[PIGS SQUEALING]
Well...
Thank you very much.
HELEN:

Why would someone go to all that trouble to implicate Bates?
Well, so that everyone thinks that Bates is the killer, which is exactly what the real killer wants.
[SIGHS] But you can't get away with killing a second time, not with Bates in custody.
So what are you saying?

I think she might be, yeah.
I think it's possible.
- I think that was your lovely friend.

- Shall we follow him?

Uh, fun.
He's been acting suspicious.
He was parked up by the woods the other night.
PHIL:

What if he sees us?
- We will claim coincidence.

- Come on.

PHIL:

HELEN:

PHIL:

- Get off.

HELEN:

- Only one way to find out.

Hey, listen.

So if it kicks off, leave it to us.
All right.

Right, we follow him inside.
One of us goes around the side in case he bolts.
PHIL:

[PANTING] Wait here.
- Shit.

[GROANS]
[GRUNTING]
[GRUNTING]
- [GROANS]

- [GROANS]

GAVIN:

[PANTING]
Look, it was just a bit of robbing.

It's the Poppy and Abby show, innit?
Everyone's making a nice bit of coin out of it.
Oh, you should be ashamed of yourself.
Yeah, well thanks for that, school bully.
[TYRES SCREECHING]
Helen, Helen.
You don't know anything about me.
Or anything about my life back then, so why don't you just shut your stupid trap?
[BREATHES HEAVILY]
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]
Yeah, I've got to go back up to Manchester.
Things are firing up on that case I was working on.
Can you stay tonight, go back tomorrow morning?
Maybe we could have dinner tonight together.
Is everything all right?
Hey, what's wrong?
Look, Helen, whatever it is, just spit it out.
I just don't think I'm ready to be a mother.
[PAUL SCOFFS]
Coming back here and seeing all this pain and anguish, it's like people make themselves vulnerable just by having kids.
- Just by loving something that much.

Close your heart to risk never being hurt.
- I need the loo.

Yeah, but I got a baby pressing down on my bladder.
[DOOR OPENING]
GIRL:

Right.
GIRL:

And?
GIRL:

Yeah, I'm coming out.
This is a bit of a nightmare, actually, you being a friend of Steve's wife, but,
I'm hoping you'll help me.
Help you?
Prove he didn't kill anyone.
Why do you think he didn't kill anyone?
Because...
That night everyone reckons he took Abigail Toms, he was with me.
It was me he was meeting in that pub.
So you, you and Stevie were together?
Yeah.
We had to meet in places a bit out of the way.
- So you have an alibi for him?

He didn't have time to get back to Polesford and kill someone.
Why not go to the police?
I'm only 16.
[SIGHS]
How long have you been seeing each other?
We didn't do anything, you know, sexual.
Not until my birthday.
He wouldn't.
We kissed.
OK, there's no need to get upset.
[SNIFFING] I'm shitting myself.
'Cause you know what they'll say?
They'll say "Well, there you are then.

"It's proof.

"You could have been next."
- But that's crap, he's not like that.

I understand.
You know we need to take this to the police.
What did you say your name was again?
Rory Harcross.
Well,
Aurora.
Blame my parents.
Harcross?
[GASPS] Oh, God, I need some air.
I'm pregnant, I'm sorry.
[GRUNTING]
[GROANS]
You learn some respect.
[GROANING CONTINUES]
Don't be scared, he's fine.
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATION]
HELEN:

- No, I don't.

Because it means you're wrong?
Why would she lie?
What has she got to gain?
She's got text after text proving the affair.
She gives Bates a rock-solid alibi for the time you've got him abducting Abigail Toms.
You're determined to prove me wrong, aren't you?
Oh, my God.
It's not about you.
Why don't you see what's staring you straight in the face?
You will not be the star of this investigation if you convict an innocent man.
Would you rather she take her story straight to the papers?
Fine, I'll take it once around the block.
Ah, by the way, your mate Linda is here.
Would you like to be the one to tell her?
She's lying.
Polesford is full of little bitches like that.
- I don't think so.

I know it can't be easy to hear, but it can't hurt to have an alibi.
Can't hurt?
How would you feel if some little slut came along saying she was screwing your Paul, saying she loved him?
I would be upset.
But given these particular circumstances,
I would rather he was a shagger than a killer.
[SIGHS]
[STAMMERING] What am I gonna tell the kids?
I don't know.
How can we tell Charli I know her stepdad is innocent because he was with a girl younger than she is?
[SNIFFING] What was she like?

- [SIGHS] She's young.

[SNIFFLES] Firm tits, slim waist.
Know your enemy.
We learnt that a long time ago, didn't we?
Who is she?
Helen, please tell me, what's her name?
You don't want to know.
I suppose that's why I never came forward earlier.
Because I knew they wouldn't believe me.
HELEN:

I'll make sure they do.
I knew her.
Abby.
We went out together a few times.
Bonded when we found out we had matching rose tats.
[CHUCKLES] "Tit tats," she called them, 'cause they were...
You know...
There.
Can't believe she's dead.
Thanks anyway.
Oh, shit.

Who, um...

My dad, why?
Do you ever see your granddad?
He lives in Hull, big deal on the council over there.
Why?
I used to know him.
HELEN:

Are you gonna tell me what this is all about?
- No.

You've been weird ever since we came down here.
There's something.

I don't want to discuss it.
We're having a child together, Helen, in case you'd forgotten.
I think that bonds us pretty tightly, don't you?
So, if there's any secrets, if there's something that you're not telling me...
Helen.
Helen.

Helen.

I was abused.
Raped.

I was 13 years old and his name was Peter Harcross.
- [PANTING] Harcross?

He was a friend of my dad's and my dad was a single father.
My mum had died and my dad didn't know how to cope,
[SNIFFING] and Peter pretended to be a helping hand.
And he knew that my dad was gay, and he used that against me.
He said if I ever told anyone, he would ruin him.
He would make sure that everyone knew, and he was a councillor, and my dad was still in the closet back then.
And it...

It was Linda as well.
He got to her, through me.
- Helen, come here.

He wanted Jenny, I know he did.
He would turn up at the house and he would pretend to be surprised that my dad wasn't in.
He would help himself to a beer, and he would sit down next to me and he would rub my leg.
[SOBBING] And I was so shit scared that she would be next, and I swore, I swore I would never...

And he said, he said that I had to keep loving him or he'd try someone else, and I knew he meant her.
That's how he would describe it,
"Loving him."
[STAMMERING] Like, like, loving means lying still, like you're dead, and throwing your guts up after, and running home so fast you can't feel your legs any more.
[GASPS]
My God, and Paula.
Paula calls me a bully.
And I was looking after them.
I was a bitch to her and Jenny because I was trying to protect them.
Like I hadn't with Linda.
And it's ruined our lives.
You know, because it...

It never leaves you, not really.

[SOBS]
Every relationship, every fucking relationship I have ever had,
I've, I've fucked up.
And it's, it's him that's to blame, that filthy fucking bastard.
Hey, baby.

- [SOBBING]

Look at me.
Hey.
You haven't fucked up every relationship, OK?
You've got me.
You've still got me.
Not for long.
What do you mean?
What are you saying, Helen?
I slept with someone.
Adam Perrin.
And it didn't mean anything much, it was just screwing.
- But...

And don't ask me for reasons, because I've got none.
He was there and I fancied him, and I knew it would mess everything up, but I didn't stop myself.
Because I couldn't, like, I have never been able to.
The baby...
Tell me it's not his, Helen.
Tell me.
I don't know.
Oh, shit.
HELEN:

It could be his, Paul, or it could be yours.
How could you do this to me?
How could you...
Why?

Because it's who I am.
And I'm sorry.

Adam Perrin?
I'm sorry.
I've got to go back to Manchester.
- No, Paul.

- Just leave me alone!

[SOBBING] Stay.
[SIGHING]
RORY: "Tit tat", she called them, 'cause they were...
You know.
There.
[MOBILE RINGING]
[RINGING STOPS]
[MOBILE RINGING]
- What?

I know who killed Abigail Toms.
It's Trevor.

TREVOR:

She had one of them stupid tattoos they all have.

That's, like, goody two-shoes around here.
[PANTING]
Where's Trevor?
- Where is he?

- You can't go up there.

You can't!
[TYRES SCREECHING]
Helen!
HELEN:

There's only one road there, so I think we can catch him.
Trevor knew about Abigail's tattoo.
It's the same as Rory's.

Plus, he's an ex-police, so he knows all about DNA and time-of-death scenarios.
And he's had all the coppers in his pub.
So, he's had the inside track on everything.
- Hiding in plain sight.

He's flaunting it.
Telling people he used to give Abigail and Poppy lifts in his car.
And it explains the fag end, too.
- From the Beer Garden.

He knew exactly what he was up to with Rory, and knew he could set him up.
HELEN:

I love you.
I know this road.

To the old pumping station.
Come on, it's this way.
- PAUL:

Why the hell didn't we search this place when we first came?
Probably under five foot of water.
- [GRUNTS]

[PANTING] That one.
Hey.
Helen.

PAUL:

- Trevor.

You shouldn't have come here.
You've put me in a terrible position.
Because now there aren't many options.
- You don't want to kill her, Trevor.

I love her.
You let us go, or I will kill her.
You try and stop me, and I will kill you.
HELEN:

Live on a little island?

It's all over, Trevor.
No, it's not.
TREVOR:

[SCREAMS]
You OK?
[GRUNTING]
[GRUNTING]
[KNIFE CLANGING]
[GASPS]
- Watch out!

[GASPS]
[GRUNTS]
[GASPS]
[COUGHING]
[INDISTINCT CLAMOURING]
REPORTER:

- It's my fault.

No.

He was my friend, that...
My little girl.
My little girl.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.
- [SOBBING]

- [KNOCKING]

You're not supposed to be here until after the Trevor Hare investigation.
Yeah, I'm not here for that.
I'm here for something else.
I want to report a historic case of child abuse.
Against who?
Me.
How historic?
- 20-odd years ago.

Peter Harcross.
He was a local councillor in my hometown.
Works in Hull now.
Few years off retirement.
- Local government?

- This will get attention.

I'm so sorry you've had to live with this.
You've seen me.
Drug dealers, criminals, I can stand up to them.
But, that man...
Paul, please.

Let's, let's at least try.
Do you know, Helen, right now, I can't even look at you.
Mikey, it's Theo.

They're gonna kill us.

All right, we're gonna find who did it.
And hit back.

HELEN:

You want a relationship with a woman who doesn't even know who the father is?
Well, I love you.
Stay away from Frank Linnell.
I've got a bit of a reputation.

HELEN:

It can't be a problem.
- Do it.
