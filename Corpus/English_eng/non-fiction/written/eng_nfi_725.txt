Previously, on "the flash"...
Four years from now,
Dr. brand invents the technology that traps savitar in the speed force.
This is the speed force bazooka.
And that's gonna trap savitar?
I know what you are.
You're a time remnant.
You all shunned me because I wasn't the true Barry Allen.
I was an aberration.
How did you become savitar?
I was broken and alone.

All I had to do was become one.
Hey.
Iris.
You know what I'd love right now?
Anything you want.
Caviar.
Caviar?
Okay.

But I'll find an assortment.
Thank you.
Just stay with me, okay?
The whole team's working on this.
And we can accomplish a lot in 24 hours.
I know we can.
I'm fine, Barry.

Get some caviar...
Hi, Barry.

There's something that I need to say to you.
Hey, cisco.
What?
Where?
All right, I'll come pick you up.
What is it?
Really good news.
- Lyla.

Gentlemen.
It's a wee bit chilly.
Wanna take this inside?
Every square inch of that building is bugged.
Figured it was better to talk out here.
Okay.

- Yeah.

Yeah.
So, I got your message.
But, you're gonna have to run me through exactly what you need again.
- Yeah...

- Right.

It's a sort of trap.

- and regenerative.

Yeah, so, I tasked our satellite to look for anything that might have our specific power requirements, and... wouldn't you know it...

I really don't think you should be spying on me, cisco.
Is it spying if we're friends?
But he's right, isn't he?

It's a piece of the dominators' technology.
We got it from the ship that crashed in central city.
- That's great.

- What?

We've searched everywhere.
This tech is the only thing that we can use.
I can't do it.
Is this because of baby Sara?
Look...

I made a big mistake.
Exactly my concern.
Barry, this is the kind of tech that wars are fought over.
If something happens and it gets into the wrong hands, people could die.

And frankly, I don't know if I can trust you to have it.
Director Michaels.
I gotta go.
Lyla, if we don't use this,
Iris is going to die.
Tonight.
I'm sorry, Barry.

You'll have to find another way.
- Are you serious?

Yeah, if Lyla won't let us have the dominators' tech, then we are gonna break into argus, and we're gonna steal it.
Wally and I will phase through the walls.
We'll be in and out of there before anyone even gets off a shot.
Hello?

- Yeah, we...

That is a meta-human power dampener.
And it's all over the building, so you can't use your powers inside.

- Bazooka.

Manipulating extra-dimensional energy requires, well, a ridiculous of energy, and the dominator tech's the only thing that can do that.

I have an idea, gang.

Put Iris on a plane to Paris, or somewhere far away?
No.

Guys.

Barry.

If your powers don't work in there, how are you gonna
- get past security?

Surveillance cameras.
- Wow.

Palm prints.
- Whoa!

- What?

They really thought of everything, didn't they?
That's just the first floor.
So, you're saying this is the most fortified structure in the history of fortified structures, they can't use their superpowers, and we have less than 14 hours to steal the thing.
And none of us are master thieves.
No.

Hello, flash.
I need your help.
Barry Allen.

This is Siberia in the year 1892.
We're a little out of your jurisdiction.
Yeah, hear me out.

I'm already helping a bunch of idiot do-gooders.
Sorry.

Would it help if I said please?
No.

Well, you have a...
Particular set of skills.
Great movie.

For you.
Why trust me now?
Spit it out, or I'm gonna step onto that ship and pretend like this conversation never happened.
Iris.
- Oy.

Mazel tov.

If you don't help me, she's gonna die.
True love.

It's all I've got.
And I assume saving your girlfriend requires us doing something less than lawful?
We need to break into argus and steal an alien power source.
The flash, a thief?
That's my kind of mission.

My rules.
Your rules.
No, I know we don't have a plane.
We steal a plane, okay?

And we parachute out of the plane, and land on the roof...
Gotta land on the right roof, all right?

Right down the air ducts.
Improbable style.
- Easy.

- Yes.

- What?

Hello, Joe!

Iris!

Captain cold.
Snart, what the hell are you doing here?
Snart's gonna help me break into argus...
Get the power source.
Awkward.
I can see you all have a lot to talk about.
I'll be down in your lab, getting everything ready.
Barry, are you out of your mind?
I thought he was with the legends.
- He is.

- Well...

- Yeah.

I thought you said you would never do that again.
I also said I would do whatever it takes to save you.

And I'm pretty sure you all feel the same way, too.

Look, I'm not changing time.
I will put him back, right where I found him.

Fine.

So what's the plan?
What are you doing?
Flash...
Damaged my suit in our fight.
Pretty badass.

Well, dress for the job you want.
We're a team, right?
Barry and Caitlin, at it again.
You're not Caitlin.
And I'm not Barry.
You sure you're gonna go through with this?
- What?

You're gonna take her to infantino street, and ram a metal spear through her back?
Well, it's either her or me.
If she doesn't die, I'm never born.
Right, but...
Behind that pretty little face of yours, you still remember everything that Barry does.
So you remember growing up with Iris, falling in love with her, kissing her.
You sure you're ready to end her life?
What I remember...
Is being created as a disposable life.
Something to be...

He didn't care about me.
Why should I care about his love?
You're not having second thoughts, are you?
Good.

What is it?
Barry went back in time to get snart's help with stealing the power source from argus.
Power source?

It doesn't matter.
Well, should I stop them?
No.

No speed gun can stop a god.
My guess is the power source is most likely here.
- Why there?

Smart, snart. "Smart, snart."
I'm gonna keep hacking' away and find out for sure.
Do you have any idea what else might be down there?
Don't matter.

Make the plan, execute the plan, expect the plan to go off the rails...
Throw away the plan.
Follow my lead and you'll be fine.
I'm trusting you.
We all are.
Just don't sit me at the single's table at the wedding reception.
Just out of curiosity, you have a plan for getting in there?
I've got that covered.
Here, hold that for a second.

Hey, flash.

Cowl on, please?

It's okay.

Good point.

Okay.
Totally should've figured that out.

- Well, carry on.

All right, Joe.

- Barry.

If I know, then savitar knows.
I'll get Wally.
We'll keep her safe, don't worry.
So here we are.
This is not good-bye.
Yeah.
Look...
I know you're gonna do whatever it takes to save me, but don't lose yourself in the process, okay?
Hello.
Harry.
Kid, Joe.
Iris.
What brings you folk to this section of the multiverse?
What's that?
It's how much time we have left.
- Before what?

We're prepping the chopper for San Francisco now.
Copy that, sir... director Michaels.

Plans changed.

Captain cold?
Always nice to meet a fan.
I'm taking the prisoner to lock-up.
Of course.

Spent so much time on that argus fake ID.
That thing's a masterpiece.
Your eye scan?
You boys really dot the "I"s and cross the "t"s.
And finally, director Michaels:
Elvis, banana.
- What the hell?

Elvis, banana...

Barry must have to come up with the next correct words in the sequence.

- Yeah, Kevin bacon.

- James brown, split.

Barry, you're gonna have to stall.
I repeat, ma'am.

My, my, my.

Magic.
- Neat trick.

Transmogrifier from h.R.'S earth.
Here you go.
Cisco, where to next?
Okay, you will take the...
East elevator?
They should do the west elevator.
- I agree with Tracy.

I used to watch you do that as a kid.
I thought you were so cool.
What'd I tell you?

Dad, look, I know this is hard for everyone, but I feel like it's hardest for you.
Dad, can I tell you something?
Yep.
When I was 16, um...
Barry and I switched rooms, so that I could sneak out of the window past curfew.
- It's true.

You...
You told me that it was because
Barry didn't like the noise
- from the street.

But in my defense, my curfew was 8:00 P.M.
- Yeah, I was a little strict.

Okay, since...

- college tuition?

I took some of that money, and I went on a blues cruise.
Junior Walker was playing.

Dad.
- That reminds me.

What was that song you used to sing all the time?
You don't remember?
I don't remember.
- "What does it take." - "What does it take"!
- I love you.

take this for me, please.
Just in case.
Make sure you give it back to Barry.
Okay.
Okay.
- Who's grodd?

Spared his life on another earth, so he could invade central city.
That's what mercy gets you.
This must be where waller kept her suicide squad.
I think this is it.

Cisco, we found it.
Cisco?
Hey, cisco, can you read me?

Hey.

Jackpot!
But there seems to be some kind of signal interference at the end of the hall, and the lock is the Montgomery 3000.
The Montgomery 3000.
- Wait, is that bad?

And aside from being completely bombproof, the Montgomery 3000 can only be unlocked by a voice-recognition system necessitating three different passcodes from three different people, and as if that weren't already enough, the thing costs $10 million to build.
37 seconds.
I must be out of practice.
Well, argus should ask for their money back.
Wait!
Make the plan, execute the plan.
Expect the plan to go off the rails.
Seen a lot of things, but a half-man, half-shark takes the cake.
I can't believe argus turned king shark into a guard dog.
King shark.

Give me your cold gun.
So you can do what, exactly?
Snart, there's only one way that tech's getting out of here.
I see.

You wanted a partner who wouldn't mind if you got all murder-y.

Give me the gun.
Open the door.
Open the door!
Have you seen "shark week," Barry?
Me, I can't get enough of it.
Good thing the waverider has cable.
What's your point?
Most sharks are cold-blooded, but the great white shark, like our friend in there, is partially warm-blooded.
- He's susceptible to cold.

If we lower the temperature in that room to 53.5 degrees, king shark should fall asleep like a little baby.
Or, you can go ahead and kill him, and prove what a badass you are.

Throw away the plan.
Ho-ho-ho.

- It's a miniature jitters.

Raspberry and coriander.
Yes it is... it's a home...

Is what it is.

It's my...

Although, I... you know what, I will say...
I have to tell you, I haven't always felt
- I belong completely.

Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.
But then you arrived.
I did?

Yeah, you did.

And with you here,
I understand my purpose.
It's us.

- Yeah, I... yeah...

Okay?

- How much?

But you know what?

- We'd be together.

And drinking so much coffee!
Tracy brand.
Will you do me the honor of joining team flash?
With you?

By all means, you first.
Thanks.
Reminds me of "jaws."
They didn't show the shark because they couldn't afford to make it look good.
How long do you think he'll stay asleep?
I like "shark week." I'm not a marine biologist.
Snart!
Barry!
This place is gonna be crawling with argus agents in the next two minutes.
Look on the bright side, Barry.

Sometimes you gotta make a tough call, Barry.
Cisco?

I have the energy source, but snart's trapped inside the cell with king shark.

I can't hack into the mainframe.
Hurry, all right?
Cisco's working on it.
Whatever you do, don't look behind you.
If cisco saves my life, tell him I'll...
Put in a good word with my sister.
Come on...
Bam!
Come on, come on!

- I got you!

I got you, I got you!
- Barry!

Hang on!
Now, cisco, now!

Ouch.

Flash!
Let's get out of here.
Lyla.
Barry.
I told you I couldn't give this to you.
- Yeah.

To save Iris' life, Lyla.

Not anything.

You could have left snart to die.
But you risked your freedom and Iris' life to save him.
You're just gonna let me have it?
I couldn't let Iris die knowing that that could save her.
And I know you'd do the same thing for me if it were John's life on the line.
Thank you.
Now go.

And get this guy back to wherever he belongs.
Took the words right out of my mouth.
Tell me, snart, did you think I had it in me?
To leave you behind?
I wasn't sure.
Always known you had the potential to be as ruthless as they come.
Your history made sure of that, same as mine.
Who knows, maybe that's why we get along.
You see the good in me.

- Maybe.

Stop trying to beat savitar at his own game.
Your goodness is your strength.
And call me sentimental...
I think the flash should remain a hero.
Take care of yourself, snart.
No strings on me.
We did it!

Yes, yes!
- Where's Iris?

Safely stashed away on earth-2 with ole Harry Wells.
Barry!

Savitar's coming.
- What?

- Iris, stay behind me.

He gets to you through my dead body.

Yeah.
I got him.
God.
It's really true.
Yes, it is.
Aim that gun at me and I'll kill you.
Listen to me.
You were my son once.
Whatever I did to make you feel this way...
I'm sorry.
Please, Barry.
No.

- Barry.

Please!

I will go with you, just please, do not kill them.
I'm not gonna kill them now.
They...

- Baby, no.

Look, Joe.

You should too.
- He took her.

- I'm sorry, Barry.

No, it's not.

I should have been there for her,
I should have protected her...

You trusted me, and I let you down.
Listen to me.

There's no way you could ever let me down.
You've become the hero I always knew you could be.
I'm gonna go get our girl back, all right?
- B.A., I'm so sorry.

I screwed up.

So, what now?
Now we go to infantino street.
We know exactly where savitar's gonna be and when.
- Is the bazooka ready?

We'll be on standby in case it fails.
It won't fail.

You didn't have that the last time, so we have the upper hand now.
All right.
You guys figure out what your plan is.
I can't be here to know any of it.
You know where I'll be.
Gauntlets, check.

- Super powers?

Locked and loaded.
Don't stress.
Tracy's bazooka...
- It's gonna work.

- Yeah, you helped.

- I didn't help.

You inspired her.

I... i didn't do anything inspiring.
You know what's inspiring?

A hero among heroes.

And you've all given me so, so much, you know?
You've given me a home, you've given me a purpose.
Now you've led me to the woman that I adore, that I wanna spend my future with, and through it all, what have I done?
What have I done?

Some fair-to-middling drumming, and lead savitar directly to Iris.
- That's not fair.

It's not fair for you to say.
Savitar tricked us.
Us?

I'm the one who opened his big, fat mouth, and now we're all in trouble, and especially Iris, 'cause I couldn't keep my mouth shut!
Hey!

Easy.

H.R... you gonna hold down the fort?
Yeah.
Of course you are.
'Cause that's what you do.
You show up.

Dependable when we need you the most.
You hear me?
I hear you.
All right.
Till next time.
Cisco.

Cisco?
- I just had a vibe.

Killer frost.
I saw this coming.
What are you talking about?
Ever since Caitlin got powers,
I've had vibes of us fighting in a forest.
This whole time I've been fighting it.
I didn't wanna face the fact that one day, she'd be this far gone.
Then go now.

What about you?

Savitar won't be with her right now.
This is our best chance to help her.
Go save Caitlin.

In other legal news, the highly publicized trial of Jared morillo, aka plunder, comes to a close.
Morillo was found guilty of grand theft and aggravated assault after he was caught by kid flash robbing the central city museum earlier this year.
Please don't fail, please don't fail.
Everybody, stay on alert.
Here we go.
I know you're here!
Come out and face me like a woman.
I didn't think you'd actually show.
That's 'cause you don't know anything about me.
Or Caitlin, for that matter.
Savitar's right.

I have to cure myself of Caitlin.
This has to happen.
I don't wanna fight you.
I don't wanna fight you, either.
I wanna kill you.
Flash.

Now the moment is upon us.
My ascension to become a god.
- Not tonight.

Let's see what happens.
I'm gonna stop you.
Ha!
It's working.
What?
It didn't work.
What... what?
Why didn't it work?
I spent an eternity in a trap just like that.
You think I didn't know how to prevent it from happening again?
The philosopher's stone.
It's made of calcified speed force energy, and you gave it to me.
No... guys... guys!
I failed.
Joe!
You stuck me with speed force for an eternity of hell.
Now, welcome to yours.
No.

Don't do this!
Now, finally, I am free of you.
Barry.
I'm begging you, just...
- Barry!

No!
Hi, Barry.

There's something that I need to say to you.
I love you.
And if something happens,
I need you to hear this.
I, Iris Ann west, take you, Bartholomew Henry Allen, to be my lawfully wedded husband.
To have and to hold, from this day forward.
In sickness and in health.
To love and to Cherish.
Until death do us part.
Iris.

Iris!
Greg, move your head.
