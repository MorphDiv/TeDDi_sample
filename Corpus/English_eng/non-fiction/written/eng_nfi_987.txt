Previously, on "Killjoys"... 437 local agents have stopped reporting for duty.
Until we know why, my investigators and I are resuming full control of this RAC
Effective immediately.
Aneela, I am sorry to say, is quite a bit insane.
Yeah, no shit.
The green breaks your bonds with anyone you've ever loved.
Khlyen is different.

No!
I'm sorry, Yala.
Holy shit, you're cured?
The thing we're fighting...

We're never gonna beat it until we understand its biology.

I need you.
Dutch, it's me.
You're back.
It was like a nightmare that never ended.
I'm not even sure if I can describe it.
If you're looking to be reinstated after your little sabbatical... you better try.
Okay.
Well, not to brag or anything, but it involves saving people, lots of people... from pirates.
Save the bullshit for Turin.
All I wanna know is why you and 400 other RAC agents disappeared three months ago.
I have nothing to do with that.

That would be death of rebel Qreshi leader Illenore Seyah.
Pawter.
Her name was Pawter.
And she didn't die.

Words matter.
Here's a pretty word: vengeance.
They never did catch that rogue Scarback who allegedly killed her, did they?
- No idea, I've been away.

Make that a RAC priority.
Just tell me what Dutch has to do with the missing agents
So that I can protect her from the fallout.
Mm.
Is that a yes?
- We're all in this together, Jaqobis.

Your entire job is bringing back missing agents, right?
Good luck with that, if word gets out that you turned on the first one who came back.
Why make me your problem when I can be your poster boy?
We're all in this together, right?
And I thought you were just the funny one.
I multitask.
Johnny Jaqobis, you are hereby reinstated as a Reclamation and Apprehension Agent in good standing.
You know Killjoys are 100% mod-free, so lose the finger banger.
Oh, you... you mean this one?
See?

I swear Benny told the RAC doctor to make it hurt.
Next time, I'm going to a Company doc on Westerley.
Yeah, good luck finding one.
Company's mostly pulled up stakes since the wall came down.
Westerley, the RAC...

I can't believe she asked you to snitch on Dutch, though.
Oh, I can.

So the brass hates us.

It's three against the Universe.
And things haven't changed that much...
- Agent 9386, missing.

Fancy calls them 'cleansed.'
Almost sounds nice.
You know what we need?
A good, old-fashioned, balls-out Warrant adventure.
Kick the dust off the booties, nothing weird, nothing mysterious, just...
Or...
So these just showed up out of nowhere?
- They've been cloaked on Arkyn for decades.

Good question.

- Uh, what's a Zeph?

Say hello.
Zeph!
New nerd, meet old nerd.
It's Johnny, and don't be nervous.
I'm sure half of what they said about me is wildly exaggerated.
Sure, okay.
- It moved.

The ship... this ship.
Turin brought it here for me to study.

We can't even open the door.

Thank you for asking.

I'd say it moved in the last...

Whoa, easy there, Captain Specific.
Radiation's half-life would make that an impossible call.
Not if you can do the math.
Well, I think I'm pretty good at math.
Well, if you were, I don't see how you could ask that question.
- Can I talk to you for a second?

I'm sure your math is very math-y.
Look, I know what you're gonna say, but... we're trying to build an army here, Johnny.

- I didn't know when you were coming back.

So, we don't need... awkward...

We need all the help that we can get.
We still have no idea what this fleet is for or where the pilots are or how to even open it.
You're back now, and we can figure it out like we always do.
Just more of us.
Come on, she's rough.

- Put your mental pants on.

Look, Dutch, I came back to team, not to teach.

Whoa, what'd you do?
I guess I opened it.
Yay.
- Clear?

I've never seen anything like this.
I have for the last three months.
Different model, but the same engine controls.
Grav generator, uhm... weird squiggly thing.
Interesting fact: the design is based on standard transistors and energy flow that we're used to in engineering.
- If anything, it's more...

I was gonna say complex.
Organic systems are always more complex.
Nature can run rings around any wrench monkey.
All right, all right, don't get your slide rules in a knot.
Slide rules?

Right?

What are these?
Flight logs, last known coordinates, and, by the looks of it, it wasn't a local trip.
So if we wanted to go to recon wherever this ship just went...
- Wait a minute...

Risk nothing, get nothing.
Look, these ships are weapons in our own backyard.
I need to know who controls them.
Anybody want my opinion?
Sorry, Johnny, I just got out of the habit of...
Go on, the floor's yours.
Okay, let's just start with some basic questions, okay?
Hey, what happened to my floor?
I skipped to the fun part.
You know you wanted me to.
Well, you said you wanted an adventure.
Commander Aneela has been very pleased with the detailed intelligence you've given so far.
Good.

All in due time, Delle Seyah.
I am Seyah Kendry, daughter of the Nine, Protector of Qresh.
You can address me as such.
Of course, Seyah Kendry.

I think I'll start with the obvious question of how she looks.
- I'm sorry, Seyah Kendry?

It doesn't require a response every time.
Seyah Kendry...
A word of advice.
As the Commander's most senior advisor, it might be best to run any questions by me first.
You know how rulers can be, especially ones as, uh...

Yes, I do known how rulers can be... because I am one.
And I'm sorry, who are you to decide what she can or cannot hear?
Kendry, welcome to my war room.
It's impressive.
I'm so pleased you survived the transfusion.
I upgraded you from whatever gutter green that was inside of you.
- What do you mean?

Some were made to take orders.
Some were born to give them.
I made sure you played for my team.
How many Hullen are there?
A lot.
Be careful out there, guys.
Just had to press that button, didn't you?
I really did.
Does any of this seem familiar to you?
Well, seen one frozen wasteland, you've seen them all.
Any idea yet how the ship bounced here?
- Not yet, but I'll figure it out.

I will... figure... it out.
So how we doing with those rad readings you were getting, Zeph?
Well, I'm monitoring the derived units of ionizing radiation to measure the stochastic effects on human tissue.

Tell me something, do you like your internal organs, or do you like-like them?
Uh, radiation's high.

But do the readings match the ones you got from the ship?
Yeah, this ship has definitely been here before.
Johnny, we're coming up to a... village.
Can you describe it?
Old-timey.
Deeply wrong.
Honey, we are so not home.
Let's go meet the neighbors, shall we?
Oh, this isn't unbelievably creepy.
We don't have any protective gear.

Sweep and clear, house by house.
Need backup?
You'll know if you hear shooting.
Let's get out of here before our piss starts glowing.
Your piss won't glow for another 58 minutes.
Guys, you gotta see this.
Looks like a time capsule from the first colonies.
It's like if...

Guys, I'm seeing evidence of a shield generator, possibly a rad blocker.
It was shut down a while ago, but this place... it's old, like, 100 years old.
So who needed the shield, then?
- Anybody hear that?

Great, I'm starting to imagine things.
Wait, I've seen this before.
Today, we will talk about smiling.
Smiling isn't just with your mouth... see?
What the shit?
What is it?

I might need therapy.
This place is Hullen.
Or it was.
Then why the radiation shield?
The last I checked, Hullen... they didn't worry about shit like that because they heal instantly.
You have to smile with your eyes too, like this.
Now you try.
It's some kind of... training hologram.
Dutch, remember what Sabine said when people get Hullenized?
They lose the ability for normal human connection.
A place like this, they could learn how to fake it.
I didn't touch anything.

What the hells is that?
There!
Uhm, my rad readings just spiked like I've never seen.
Some sort of solar flare, maybe?
It's about to...

I think it's a countdown.
Dutch, D'Av, I don't know what's happening.

- What, Johnny?

It's the sun.
Big flare coming your way.

Close your eyes!
- How'd we get into orbit?

Why don't you have control?

The flare's EMP shorted everything out, same as what's screwing with our comms.
What the hells is going on?
The last thing I heard Johnny say was 'flare.'
- We need to get back to the ship.

- I can't find my ass right now.

- You know where east is?

- Gun, someone took my gun!

Once we return to the Quad with your armada behind me... us...

Interesting proposal, well-thought out.
However, the Commander has already decided that, with the loss of our resources in that area, it was best to wait
- and gather intelligence before...

I made them.
I haven't heard from my father in weeks.
I brought you here because I know you're his ally in the Quad.
Where is he?
Well, I'm...

Gone where?
He's dead.
Oh.
I see.
But I can at least tell you what happened.
No.
Now you stay... and you see what you've done.
- Are you okay?

Shit, we need to find another way out.
This way... follow me, quick!
Who the hells is that?
I'll take my chances.
- There was a key and the key is a seed...

- A circle's a seed, a seed is a tree...

Are you... praying?
What?

I'm so sorry, I get aggressive when anxious.
Did you get controls back?
Sure, sure, almost.
So we are gonna die.

- Uh, oh, my God.

Why did you stay on the ship?
Because you don't like me or trust me to stay alone?
What?

Well, okay, yes, fine, but what did you stay here to do?
Compile data so I can better understand the situation.
Or, put another way, you saw weird shit happening, and you wanted to figure it out,
- which makes you...

Mm, or, put another way...
A nerd.

So let's do some nerdy shit and save the day.
Radiation, what do we know?
Okay, well, the solar flare is receding, so if Dutch and D'Av covered their eyes,
- they should be okay.

I'm gonna work on getting the comms and controls back online.
You work on predicting the next flare.

Oh, uh, tiny side note.
Um, repeated exposure will affect parts of the small organs like the eyes, leading to permanent blindness, and then it gets... it gets much, much, much...

Don't get scared.

Okay.
You're back for the Remnant.

Wait, back from where?

You can't see a thing with that thing covering your eyes.
You're sewn shut.
Who did this to you?

What's that?
We have to go fast.
Don't shoot!
We're back.

Don't know.

- I'm not finished with this test.

Which won't help us if the ship boofs again before we get back!
Worry about boofs later.

Oh, Zeph, we got company.
Come down slowly.
I need to test a theory first.
Zeph?
So, what's fun around here?
You guys got, like, any sports?
Oh, great, now I owe Dutch 20 joy.
Where's Zeph?
Here's my professional opinion about your new nerd.
She sucks.
We have been waiting for you.
Well, you can keep waiting.
We're not going anywhere with tall, dark, and screechy over there.
Him?

They stay above to protect us.
It is the ultimate sacrifice.
Oh, yeah, much better.
I am Yarin.

Are you the Undying?
Y... esss?
We have so much to show you.
So the flares are why you live down here.
We have to.
The sun poisons everything above ground.
Only the Guardians may go.
Bless their sacrifice.
So those suits that they're wearing...

Yeah, I guess being screechy nightmares is just a bonus.
You don't speak like the Undying I remember.
We're from a different branch.
The Last Seer will understand.
Who is the Last Seer?
When can we talk to him?
Oh, he'll do more than that.
Go on.
Stay cool, guys.
Look to the stars, for there they will orbit.
What the hells is this?
It's a celebration, and you are the guests of honor.
Well, not too bad, all in all.
The slicings and stabbings we can heal.
It's the beheadings and limb-severings I resent.
Waste of perfectly good soldiers.
Where are you going?
To get someone to clean up the rest of this.
But my dear, you're right here.
I am Delle Seyah Kendry of the Nine Families of Qresh, and I will not be spoken to in this manner by the help.
But you aren't Delle Seyah Kendry of the Nine anymore.
You are Hullen.
You're down here now with the rest of us in her muck.
And this blood is on your hands.
So clean... it... up.
So we're thinking Undying Hullen?
Probably, but then who are the mole people?
Hullen can't go blind.
Silence for the Last Seer.
Friends, today is a sad day.
One of our children went above.
But Seer, the Undying are here.
Ah, the Undying, yes.
Yarin, as speaker of the Unseeing, perhaps you could lead the sermon.
I'm sure our new friends would love to hear about the faithful.
Many years ago, we came to this place to serve the Undying, immortal gods that so loved humans, they sought to learn our ways, to honor us.
Well, that's one way to put it.
But then, they left, and it was not ours to question why.
Nor when they took away the shields that protected us.
But did we weaken?
No.

Did we break faith?
No!

Because we had the Last Seer.
A miracle.
He promised us that you would return.
He told us that our blindness was a gift.
A gift we even gave to our children.
We stitched their eyes at birth so that their first sight would be... our gods, returned.
And now you have.
This is starting to get... what comes after awkward?
But not all of us stayed faithful.
One of us went above ground against my word.
But Seer, surely today we...

And so now, it is upon us... to show our new friends what comes from that.

Wait, he's baiting us.
Trying to draw us out.
Please, I'm so sorry.
Your stitches are a gift, but your eyes belong to the Unseeing, and you don't deserve them anymore.
Okay, waiting's over.
They are Unseeing.

Take them.
So we tell Turin about this, we're gonna skip the part where we got jumped by a bunch of blind dudes.

Well, it wouldn't be an issue if you haven't gone and gotten a new nerd.
You're the one who left.

Are you kidding me?
For the first time in our lives, you're the one who took off, and I got to stay and be the responsible one.
I loved it.

Johnny, you know I'm glad you're back, but that doesn't mean things aren't gonna be weird.
You left.
This is what coming back feels like.
You know, I find people are always more honest when they can't see.
Something about the dark.
It makes us all vulnerable.
If the other Undying learn of how you've treated us...
Yeah, what will you do?

I know you're not one of them.
You tried to save that girl.

Who are you?
Where did you get that ship?
Hey, hey, leave her alone.
Hey, asshole...

Listen to this, prick.
I know I should feel worse about punching an old blind dude, but I don't, and I'm cool with that.
Oh, what was that horrible sound?
Ultra high frequency, figured their hearing would be heightened, and they'd get their ass kicked by a shriek.
Does that mean we're about to get rushed by those screaming stalker things?
No, it was directional.

Then let me take you to The Room That Sings, to find the Remnant.
The Remnant, what is that?

It's what you came for the last time you were here.
We've never been here before.

You came here three days ago.
You said you needed to find the Remnant, or the lady would come and kill everyone.
I did?

Underground, there is nothing but whispers everywhere.
I like to go above ground and just hear nothing.
I didn't know how you came.

You said you needed the Remnant, that it was important, and that we were keeping it safe for you.
I told you I didn't know what that was, but the Last Seer might.
But then the alarm sounded, and you had to leave.
But you said you'd come back and take me away with you.
And now you're here.
You can't see.

I know that chin.
And that voice.

Johnny, I don't remember any of this.

Compared to what?
Stabbing me, switching bodies with Khlyen, making eyeballs explode?
On D'Av the magic pony scale, this is a five, maybe a six.
Johnny, this isn't funny.
I know, but I'm back now, and we will figure it out, like we always do, and we can start by figuring out why you came here in the first place.
Then let me take you to The Room That Sings.
Well, that sounds better than the room that shoots you a bunch.
You do realize...
I'm the one with the gun, and you're the one surrounded by a bunch of blind, religious lunatics?
Not much of a believer.
I am the Last Seer.

And stitching little girls' eyes closed...
What kind of miracle is that?
Don't judge belief until you know where it came from.
- The gods decreed.

- The gods that were here before...

We call them Hullen, and we want to know why they all left.
Who said they all left?
The Room That Sings.

I'm not sure if it's singing, but it sure is gorgeous.
I mean, this ship is old, like, 100 years old.
Surprised it still runs.
You're Hullen, aren't you?
Is that your question?
No.
My question is, if they all left, why did you stay?
Because he told me to.
Why is it that you think this Remnant is here?
This is a room where no one is allowed.
Not even Yarin.
If something were important, I'm sure the Seer would hide it here.
Can you see it?
I still don't know what it is that we're looking for.
Try looking at this.
Security cam, last day on record.
You recognize anyone?
Khlyen.

I'd been running this reintegration camp for 100 years, and along he comes to shut it down.
Took the recruits, left the human slaves and me.
- Why?

Where'd you get the ship?
We found it.

Did he come up with this religion?

When the shields were shut down, they went blind in weeks.
They came up with the whole Unseeing thing.
I thought: "What harm could fables do?"
And why not get treated like a living god while you waited, huh?
It has its benefits.
Besides...
Khlyen said he was coming back.
That isn't bullshit, is it?
Is that your question?
My question is: "Is Khlyen coming back for it?"
Yes, now go and get it.
Get what?
The Remnant.

If you don't know what it is, it's not for you, is it?
Why are you really here?
Khlyen's dead.
It's Khlyen.

Did you recognize him from that video?
Right, uhm...
Here.
This is his symbol.
If he left anything, this might be on it.
Do you recognize this?
I know that shape.

Oh, hey, that's okay.

Perfect, love ya.
Khlyen is dead?

I saw it with my own eyes.
He sacrificed himself to poison the Arkyn pool and free the Arkyn born.
He's not coming back.
I have been waiting here for 30 years.
I watched these people lose everything.
I've let them believe whatever they needed.
I've let them stitch their own children's eyes!
But what do you care about a bunch of slaves?
Well...
Well, I don't, I mean, I just, I...
Do you need your goggles when you go out now?
Do you get sick afterwards?
Are you starting to feel things even for the Unseeing?
You've been cleansed.
You're not Hullen anymore.
You're human.
Rejoice, the Undying have returned!
Returned, rejoice.
Come gather...

Can you see them?
Come gather...

No, I see nothing.
But I can hear them.

Dutch, you there?
Bit busy.
This apocalypse thanks to you?
Yeah, well, I couldn't find you, so I had to think fast.
Phase one complete.

I'm blasting ship sounds to buy us time.
- Still no sign of Zeph.

I'm working on it.

It's the children's duty to care for the altar.
We're not supped to know what's inside it, but...
I opened it once.

It's in there.
Now, that looks like something you'd call a Remnant.
Yeah, but what is it?
Whatever it is I came for, I guess.
But we need to go.
What's wrong?
I promised I'd take you, apparently.
Yeah, but I didn't actually think you'd come back.
What if it's awful?
You wanna know the truth?
Some of it will be awful, but some of it will be beautiful too.

But you get to choose, okay?
Rejoice, the Undying have returned.
Okay, I'll do it.
It's the chin, isn't it?
Rejoi... da...
What's happening?

- Johnny?

It's some sort of power surge, but I'm coming to get you now.
Khlyen is not coming back, is he?
No, that's what I keep telling you.

- You've got to tell them the truth.

That all this is for nothing?
They did everything for a lie?
They'll turn on me.

It doesn't have to be.
You can still save them.
Friends, Unseeing, it's been a long, hard road, and now it appears it'll be a little bit longer.
- This woman is a false prophet.

She's tempting you.
But you are strong.

Do you believe?

- Then kill the liar.

Show the Undying your faith.
Johnny, get fighty out here!
Hold them off...

Kill her.
The sun, go below!
Everyone, go below!
They've...

Dutch!
Hey, it's me.
I don't know how, but Zeph is here.
For the record, I still hate her.
Careful, careful!
Relax, I sutured livestock on my farm all the time.
This does not make me feel better, Zeph.
Quinn, we're almost done.
That tickles.
- Can I open them now?

Wait.
Okay, now.
Wow, that was way more rewarding than livestock.
I know starting over is scary, but the monks I'm taking you to are good people.
Are you crying?
- Are you...

It's just like you said.
It's beautiful.
Well, that's just a cargo hold, I mean...
But I know what you mean.
What?
No, it's nothing, I...
I just thought you'd be better looking.
Oh.
- But how did you...?

At first, the ship moved when it was in danger and came back when it was safe.
But then I realized...
Who was standing near the ship when it first opened?
Who pressed the controls to get us here in the first place?
Dutch, right?
So I thought, hmm, hey, dumb-ass, maybe the key to controlling these ships is not a code or a button, but a person, so I scraped the controls for her residual DNA, slapped it on a polymer strip,
and bam, I'm a fancy pilot.
Dutch is the key to the whole fleet.
So... do you want to tell her, or can I?
You can't still be angry with me.
Oh, I really can.

No, I strategically absented myself from you.
Come on, I weighed the odds.

You really don't get it.
Fine, next mission, I'll check with you first before I do anything amazing.
There isn't gonna be a next time.
But I'm the new nerd.

And, as the old nerd, I'm telling you your job isn't just to be right.
It's to be careful.

The missions?

And Dutch and D'Av are brave as shit, but they cannot do what we do, and they know it.
If we tell them to run into fire, they will, so you better be sure that you can get them back out.
Is that why you abandoned your team for months?
To protect them?
No.
That's why I came back.
And that's why I'm assigning you this.
Put your ego aside, and figure out how to open this for the team.
And then we'll talk again.
I've missed your way with smart women, John.
I missed you too, Luce.
Wait, is that sarcasm?
So you went on an instantaneous interstellar journey, and you don't remember anything about it?
I don't remember coming on board, I don't remember flying anywhere.
- I don't even know where else I might've gone.

- Hearing about my woes makes you think "party?"

Finally, my welcome home party.

- It's not for that either.

We're here to christen D'Av's new fleet.
- Your fleet, you mean.

As much as I hate to admit that Zeph is right...
- you pushed the button.

You pushed my hand.
Zeph scraped my DNA.
Wait... he's in charge of the fleet?
Do you know how insufferable that's gonna make him?
- But why?

That's one approach.
Khlyen never did anything without the plan.
The Remnant, these ships...
When he was dying, he must have used his weird connection with D'Avin one last time to carry it on.
But Khlyen's gone, and all that matters is our plan, our war.
These ships are key to reaching Aneela, and we're gonna use the shit out of them.
That's what we're celebrating.
Whatever's coming...
We're gonna be ready for it.
Aneela.
You need to get up.
You can't lead from a bed.
What does it matter anymore?
My mistake.
I thought... you were your father's daughter.
I am his only daughter!
Then show me.
Show all of them.
You know... nothing... about me, little bird.
I know what it's like to have power fail you.
To be betrayed, to lose everything you love.
Everything falls, Aneela, from fathers to empires.
But... we... are queens.
And queens... rise.
What do you want,
Qreshi?
So share in your vengeance and sit at your table.
I can help you get the woman who killed your father.
I know exactly how to hurt her.
Good.
Stay.
I still don't understand.
You look so much like...
We don't say her name.
Ever.
Until she's dead.
