He lifts you up when the battle goes down, get ready for your host, LL Cool J.
You don't stop!

Hands in the air, put 'em side to side.
Now let me hear you say, "Yeah!"
Audience:

Now scream!
(audience screams)
Wow.

Welcome to Lip Sync Battle, the show where your favorite stars lip sync to their favorite hits.
Now tonight's show promises to be fire, flames, ferocious.
But, before we meet the celebs,
I gotta bring out my right hand, the colorful commentator.
The voracious, the loquacious...
Chrissy Teigen.

Woo!

Go, Chrissy, uhn.

Oh, I'm feeling so good.

Listen, I've been known to have girl-crushes, but nothing like tonight.

These stars are gonna battle it out.
They're gonna go hard because they're friends, too.
So it's gonna get nice and catty and evil,
- and I love it.

- Rawr.

Look at you all into it.
Why not?

Chrissy, you get on up there, it's time to get it going.
I'll see you in a bit.
Are you guys ready?
Let's bring 'em out.
(rock music plays)
She won over our hearts in He Got Game, made us laugh in Zoolander one and two, and stars in the wildly-successful Resident Evil franchise.
Give it up for Milla Jovovich!
(cheering)
Oh, my god, Milla's in the building.
This next young lady, she's stellar in Orange is the New Black, soon you can catch her in xXx:

Ladies and gentlemen, Ruby Rose!
(cheering)
Milla:

Chrissy:

- Chrissy, you want to say something to the ladies?

I'm sorry.

Whew!

- LL:

- Oh, my gosh, thank you!

If you guys want to hang out after,
I'm free, so let me know.
I just want to be the chauffeur.
(laughing)
- Honey, you can drive my car any time.

See?

Okay.

Milla, you have a seat in the VIP for one moment.
So, Ruby, what the first song you're doing tonight?
It's called, uh, Bitch.
(laughing)
Well, ladies and gentlemen...
- Do you mind?

Ruby Rose!

Chrissy, those are some powerful lyrics.
Do you think Ruby pulled it off?
Perhaps the most literal dancing I've ever seen on this stage.
You're like, "I'm a bitch, I'm a mother..."
Like you were...

It was so...

I'm so happy right now.
- That's a classic.

Really good.

I think I'm just gonna go home now.
- Chrissy:

- It's done.

I love your ink, by the way, that's so amazing.
He touched me.
You touched me, but you haven't touched her yet, so...
- Oh, yeah.

Oh, man, it's stuff like that.
That's how it works, huh?

All that kind of stuff.
Okay.

Milla, come on over.
Ruby Rose, everybody.
Milla, come on over.
So, uh...
We about to see what you got, huh?
I guess so.
A little nervous.

You're a little nervous?

So, what did you pick as your first song?
Uh, my first song is
- Boyz-n-the-Hood by Eazy-E.

Damn!
I grew up on Eazy, NWA, um, you.
Oh, that's funny.

Well, ladies and gentlemen...
Just give me one moment to gangsterize.
Oh, you're getting gangsterized on top of that.
Oh...

Now you de-gangsterizing.
Chrissy, did Milla take you back to your hood days?
Oh, my hood days?
That brought me back to those hood days.
Nobody on this planet does not scream that song when it comes on.
- It's so good!

So, Ruby, Ruby...
I knew that you were gonna do rap.

Why?

'Cause you love rap, and I knew you were gonna kill it.
And I was like, "I'm gonna stay away from rap." I just knew that.
All right, Milla, you go in the VIP and hang out for a second.
♪ The boyz n the hood are always hard ♪
Okay, so round one was explosive.
Next, round two.
Where they take their performance to a new level of enormous.
We're far from done.

It's Lip Sync Battle.
LSB is back!
Round one gave both Ruby Rose and Milla Jovovich the chance to dip their toes in the water.
But now it's round two, and it's time for 'em to go all the way in.
Let's see how Milla, a veteran of battling zombies, prepared to bring the stage to life.
Listen, she has no chance.
No, chance, Ruby.
Morning.

Are you ready for tonight?
Getting my superhero on.
(cameras clicking)
Oh, perfect.
Do you guys have any, um...
Earrings with the little cross?
- Cross.

What do you think about getting, like, one of those skin-colored tank tops?
And maybe have pretend muscles?
- Oh, my god.

Okay, places please!
The top of this number.

Pleasure to meet you.
- How cool.

Yes!

Yeah, just that, like, creepy graveyard feeling.
Here.

- I can get that for you.

I'm excited.
I hope it all turns out right.
- It will.

Yes.

Here we go!
- That was amazing.

Serious?

You did, but it was fine.
What's up, Ruby?

'Cause I'm gonna kick your butt all over this town.

I...

I don't know if this was symbolic or not, but you had me throwing dead Ruby Roses everywhere.
- Oh!

- Ouch.

- You gave 'em to me.

Ruby always has a trick up her sleeve.
- Uh-oh!

Thank you, Milla.
Oh, baby.
No, you... that was unbelievable.
You should have this hair all the time.
- (laughing)

It's so good.
Are you gonna steal me away from my husband?
- Yeah.

You mean again?
My, like, body temperature is hot right now, 'cause I am gonna die.

I'll let you feel my abs later.
- Ooh!

I could even take 'em off and give 'em to you.
Milla, the VIP awaits you.
- You can go over there and have a seat.

Milla took us to a headbangers ball, and now Ruby gets her chance to answer back.
The battle is close.

And now it's Ruby's moment of truth.
Let's take a look at how she worked to make sure that when it comes to that belt, the moment will belong to her.
Hi.
(cheering)
We can't do the music yet because your partner's here.
- Where's she at?

- Where's she at, huh?

Okay.
- Then I can throw it.

Gangster.

Plus, that is my go-to dance move anyway.
- Right?

And be like, every other move that I do it on.
Wow.

- You want to see yours?

These are the pants.
- Wow.

- But it gives the appearance of it.

And I'm not gonna have a Lenny Kravitz moment.
No Lenny Kravitz moment.
You'll come to the front.
So step.

Okay.

Was left over...
It goes like this.
- I knew that.

(bleeps)
- Uh-oh.

You don't get to know what's underneath here.
Wouldn't you like to know?

- Yeah.

Muah.
- Word up.

In five, here we go.

Chrissy:

LL:

That was physically active!
Oh my...
Did Ruby throw the kind of party you want to get into or what?
Ruby Rose, my Australian dream machine, that is unbelievable.

- Yo.

So many talents.

I've never seen anything like it.
Everyone always asks me, like, my top three favorite battles.
I swear to god, you two brought it tonight.
So amazing!
Thank you.
Argh!

I want more (bleep) to break.
- I got nothing.

You want me to give you a chair?

Here.

I feel like Chrissy just wants to throw things.
(cheering)
- Awoo!

Like, when you were flying over the crowd.
What was going through your mind?
It's like, "Take this, Milla!"
Oh!
I took it.

Whoo!

- Ruby, you can head on over to the VIP.

LL:

Both Milla and Ruby brought it.
And now their work is done.
It's up to the audience to choose a new champ.
We find out next.

Now, is the champ Ruby Rose?
(audience cheers)
Or is the champ Milla Jovovich?
(audience cheers)
- Milla!

LL:

No.
The battle is over now.

I love you, baby girl.
- And...

Well, thanks to Milla and Ruby for being a part of the Lip Sync crew tonight.
One love from me, LL Cool J, and my girl, Chrissy Teigen.
