Serena?
Hey!

You told me you did your math homework.
You lied to me again.

I can't do it!
And I don't get why I have to.
Jesse didn't finish college, and he's the greatest singer who ever lived.
Yeah.
Well, Jesse may not have finished college, but he finished the third grade.
Serena, we had an agreement.
Any more unfinished homework...
No!
I'm sorry.
I have to go to that concert!
- Dad.

Mommy said I can't go to Jesse's concert.
Tell her...
Tell her to give me a second chance.
Serena, you promised your mother.
Math makes my stomach hurt.
Jesse is life.
What if she does it this morning before school?
Tom, Serena and I had an agreement, remember?
Come on, Mom.

I'll tell you what... get the homework done right now, don't lie to your mother again, ace your next quiz... which I know you can do... and we'll all go to Jesse as a family, frontrow seats.
They're sold out.

One of the perks of being district attorney... connections.
Come here.
- Go.

Carefree days of youth.
Tom.

She lies, and the consequence is frontrow seats?
She deserves to have a childhood.
She deserves to be ready for adulthood.
The hours I work, never getting to see her...
I don't want to be the bad guy.
Which makes it my job?

She has a wild soul, like you, and I don't ever want her to lose that.
I love her soul.

But there's such a thing as too wild.
I hear you.
And I understand.

- Yeah.

Just back me up from now on, okay?
Always.
Seriously.
I couldn't... be... more serious.
You're so bad.
We now go to the Capitol, where, following the killer's third brutal strike in 10 days, the governor had this response.
I am confident that the legislature will support me, at last, in taking the necessary steps to end the moratorium on executions.
Down the rabbit hole I go.
The Heidi case has ripped open?
For starters.
- Morning.

Morning, Barry.
Good morning, sweetheart.
Serena is in math homework jail, so don't let her con you into any detours on the way home from school.
Criminals live in fear.
It's time to strike back with the most powerful deterrent we have.
Should the moratorium be lifted, the first inmate to be executed will be Danny Jackson, convicted of three murders in Spanish Harbor 10 years ago.
The case made a stir because Jackson's own brother was the star witness for the prosecution...
Grandma?
Why is my dad on TV?
Are they gonna kill my dad?
No.

YYou promised they were never going to.
I swear to you on my own life...
I'll never let them hurt my baby.
Jackson should be found not guilty on the grounds that he suffers from a genetic disorder linked to intellectual disability.
But the state argued successfully that his disability was not a factor in the crimes.
This week on "Most Wanted:

three murders, zero leads.
For the third time in a week and a half, a young woman stabbed to death.
Once again, the killer signs his work in blood.
- Go to the other cam.

Hey, boss?

Well, it was either border war in Pakistan, the funeral of a U.S. senator, the governor's short list of candidates to replace him...
Or dead bodies in Dumpsters all over town.
On our tombstones, Mara...

Ready to help the cops bag another one?
Look who's starring on Channel 5.
Stockbroker returning home to her milliondollar apartment on...
Yes, 10 years ago, I prosecuted Danny Jackson for all three murders.
So, no regrets, Mr. Price?
If the moratorium's lifted, you have total faith you won't be sending an innocent man to his death?
Well, I have total faith in the gifted defense attorneys who've given everything they've got to making sure this man had the full benefit of due process and the law.
Thank you, Michelle.
Mr. Price!
You will hear the defense make much of Mr. Jackson's limited intellectual capacity.
But he had the intelligence to lie in wait for Carina Markovich, to put on the gloves with which he strangled the life out of Janice Kim, to stalk Susanna Spencer, his brother's fianc√©e, the night he slaughtered her.
It's not true!

It's not true!

You shouldn't be here, Mrs. Jackson.
I have files to show you.
In the lineup for the first victim,
Danny was the only Caucasian.
In the second lineup, he was 3 1/2 inches shorter than all the other suspects!
Ma'am, would you step back, please?
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Jackson.
I'm running for your mom's dry cleaning, and you know the cleaningday rules, so don't party too hard, okay?
Don't worry.
I'll only have a hundred friends over.
I'll be right back.
What's up, Tiger Lily?
Hi, angel.
Does your husband think he can just not pay?
Who is this?
You better get home quick with the whole $60k.
Serena's waiting for her mother.
And cops... not such a good idea.
You have 10 minutes.
Dance break!
Ayeaye, Captain Nico!
Hey!
Get away from my daughter!
Captain Nico says if you borrow money, it's bad not to pay it back.
Truly, it was...

I apologize.
Inspector Kupner, will you please acquaint this man with the concept of wasted breath?
We are licensed investigators legally collecting a debt from a Mr. Davidson Norris.
It's not our fault nobody told our client the guy moved.
The only relevant fact here is that this man broke into my home and terrified my 8yearold daughter.
I wasn't scared for one second.
We were having the best time ever.
We'll take care of it from here, Mrs. Price.
Let's not tell Daddy about this, okay?
It will only upset him.
Don't worry, Captain Nico.

Okay, come on.

Stop thinking with your head, Cupcake.
Think with that big bleeding heart of yours.
Think about what this would do to Jenny's parole.
Don't do this, Nico.
One teeny, tiny tap on "delete,"
and just like you getting to second base with Heidi Wilson in 8th grade, this never happened.
That totally happened.
Not according to Heidi it didn't.
Muscling deadbeats for cash?

Hello, Nico.
Hola, Captain Sarneau.
What's the illustrious former detective being charged with?
Unlawful entry.
Enjoy your stay, Nico.
What are you inhaling?
Cold sweat dripping from a perp right before he caves, rust on a badge after a rainy stakeout, dust gathering on overtime requests.
The sweet, musty aromas of my old life.
You wishing you had it back?
That would be a prizewinning waste of time.
Right at that desk, Nico.
Me looking at five years for soliciting and possession, you cutting me loose for reasons I have yet to fathom.
So...
I am expected to believe that totally by some random coincidence, you just happened to break into the loft of the prosecutor who put your brother on death row.
What?
That woman was...
Mrs. Thomas Price.

Don't insult the distant memory of our friendship by pretending that you didn't know, okay?
Look, whatever hellish game you were up to here, you take it to another precinct.
A million people in this city...

Apparently, 100%, because that's what happened.
How long do we have to keep waiting for?
Till the person I need to see comes home.
Jesse!
Ruby, no!
That's my favorite song!
Mine too!
I bet it's gonna go triple platinum.
My God.

It's so beautiful!
Take it.

Thank you!
My name's Ruby.
I have 16p11.2 deletion syndrome.
But we all have something, right?
What's your name and what do you have?
Serena Price, and...

No.

Mrs. Price, could you give this to your husband, please?
These are files regarding the case of my son, Danny Jackson.
I'm sorry.

Message me @JesselsGod!
Sweetie, we have to go.
Ruby's funny, she's nice, and she loves Jesse way more than I do, which I didn't think was possible.
Why can't I call her?
Because her grandmother...
Her grandmother what?
Sweetie.
You have 10 math problems due by tomorrow... and spelling, and you haven't even started.
So...

Can I call her after I'm done?
Focus.
Serena?
Snack time, angel.

Mr. Debray!

This is Serena.
Serena, this is my favorite teacher, Mr. Debray.
Well, we're glad you're here, Serena.
Okay.
Hey.

Dance time!
Serena!
Do you have any idea how frightened I was?
I think it would be better if you didn't see Serena anymore.
Please don't go!
Do not grab my daughter.
Are you okay?
Look what you did!

It was the most important thing in the world to her!
Is everything okay here?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry the camera's broken.
I'll fix it and I'll bring it back to the school, okay?
You did notice she wasn't a student here, right?
All right.
- I'm right here, Ruby.

Come here.
Don't ever, ever, do this again!
How did you get there?
We took the bus, just like a billion people do every day.
Serena, the city is very dangerous.
A tire blew.
That was cool!
But don't ever try that again, okay?
They'll have the tire changed in two minutes.
You okay?
All right.
Thanks for letting me use your phone.
Is she your daughter?
Yes.

She's beautiful.
Where is she?
It's such a lovely store.
I don't know why I never noticed it before.
There's something I'd like to give you... an oldfashioned photograph.
Would you like one?
Yes, please!
It's lovely.

You will soon lose something more precious to you than anything in the whole world.
Water will take it away.
That is your fate... written in stone a million years before you were born.
It's late.

Fate is your enemy.

The only way is to fight her headon.
But you cannot win until the price is paid.
For one to live, one must die.
Who has to die?
Come on, sweetheart.

Serena, get in the car.

Nothing is a coincidence!
Everything is connected!
Don't sleep too long.

Rich wife plus lying', cheating' husband equals this month's rent.
Siesta first.
Why did you put that up?
A reminder that even the icy heart of a police captain can be melted and that even the pure heart of a little girl can be conned into thinking that Nico Jackson's ass is worth saving.
She does have a way with glitter.
I'm waking you up in half an hour.
- Yeah.

Don't judge me.
Nico, are you in there?

Hey, Mom.
Uncle Nico, Uncle Nico, Uncle Nico!
You're getting heavy!
Mom?
Nico, did you hear what the governor said?
Hey, Ruby, you want to run grab yourself a soda from the fridge?
Man, you bet!
Go ahead.
Yes.
I heard what the governor said.
- You know Danny.

- He loved Susanna like you did.

- And the others... he could never have...

- Please, Nico.

The confession, Mom.
- You've got to stop, Mom.

Tell him it was dark that night, that you're not sure what you saw.
Mom!
Could you just... visit him?
Before...
Hey.
I have some work I have to get back to, okay?
But I want you to visit me again, all right, Ruby Tuesday?
Goodbye, Uncle Nico.
Potatoes...
Fried!
I killed her!
Who did he say was responsible for Susanna's death?
What did your brother say when you saw him with the body?
Mr. Jackson?
Whoo!
Aww!
Yay!
Make a wish before you say anything, or it won't come true.
It already has.
You say that every year.
Present!
Ooooh!
Looks like a regular, normal pen, right?
Wrong!
Press this button, and it's a laser death ray.
- Pew, pew, pew!

I love it, sweetie!
Dad, have you seen my journal?
On the windowsill.
Did you peek?
I swear on all the hobbits in The Shire, I didn't.
Mnh!
Are you okay?
- Sweetie!

Look.

You're good.

I love Jesse, but can we have something quieter?
City in terror as the killer claims a fourth victim in a grim replay of an all...
Okay.
Who wants cake for breakfast?
My husband always was a passionate man.
A bastard and a criminal... but passionate.
$5,000.
Dangerous man like your husband, that's the rate.
- Two double cosmos.

Make that one.
When I indulge, things tend to get a little... unpredictable.
Maybe I'm in the mood for unpredictable.
That's revenge talking.
You underestimate yourself.
That's a sin I've never been accused of.
God.
Sing me the song again...

Yeah.
Let's skip coffee and get right to the show tunes.
Aw, please?
Can you hum me a few bars?
You don't remember?
That's the upside of being a blackout drunk... less to regret.
Well, we'll make new memories, then.
Sounds good.
You're a talented man.
Anya?
Don't worry.
It's just my soontobeexhusband.
Yeah.

Who's there?
Anya?
Hey!
Tonight, the city is bracing itself after the body of another woman was found in a Dumpster behind a popular nightclub in the Richmond District.
Authorities believe her to be the fifth victim of a killer stalking city streets.
I saw her.
I remember the skull on her Tshirt in this club in the Richmond, Park something...
No, Parade.
Something that begins with a "P."
I was there from, like, 11:00 to midnight.
Is it the place?
How do you pick them?
What's your pattern?
Sweetheart.
I'm so sorry.
I know how much he meant to you.
WWhy do people have to die?
Sometimes... things just are.
And they hurt.
There's a midnight vigil at his house.
I want to ggo with Ruby.
Let me talk to Dad, okay?
That's what you always say when it's no.
Why can't I go?

Because midnight is too late.
And Ruby... she's much older than you.
I understand this is hard.
You don't understand anything!
You're the worst mom in the world!
You didn't even fix the camera yet, and if you hate Ruby, I hate you!
You can fix it?

And then there were six.
Do the cops have anything?
Just this... in her pocket.
Mara, we're nailing this guy.
Get me every witness, every police report, every scrap of CCTV.
I'll get us an hour on prime time on Tuesday, with a callin.
You think we can pull it together by then?
Do not let the witnesses talk to each other in the greenroom.
How you doing, sweetie?
Aaron!

He looks like a Christmas tree.
- Mom?

I miss Ruby.
I've been really good, and I've done all my homework.
Can I please go see her?
Let me talk to Dad about it.
Laura.

Yes, we are.
Okay.
Yes?

Hi, Barry.
Well, I promised Serena that Auntie Mara would walk her down, okay?
And here she is.
All right, beautiful.

Hi, Auntie Mara.
I've got to work late, but I will come in and kiss you.
I never want you to kiss me again.
Well, I love you, no matter what.
In five, four, three...
It's just over there.

- Yeah.

All right.
Hey.
See you.
What do you want from me?

We have operators to take your calls and Captain Sarneau and her team here to follow up on every lead you give us.
Captain Sarneau?
Take a look at this sketch.
Caucasian male, brown hair, long face.
Tighter on the sketch.
Now, our profilers are telling us that...
- Yes?

- I thought you were sending her out.

- Not here yet.

Laura, I'm telling you...

Somebody claiming to be the killer...

Laura, are you there?
Some crime stoppers you are.
You think you can catch me with that pathetic sketch?
I wish I was that goodlooking.
How do we know you're who you say you are?
The news didn't mention the sapphire ring that I took from the second girl.
I hope you're watching, District Attorney Price.
Because I'm one criminal you'll never put on death row.
Recognize this voice?
Talk.

Mom!

Are you listening now?
I have your daughter.
I better have your attention, too... everybody's attention.
So much for the death penalty as a deterrent, Mr. Governor.
Ready to have a child's blood on your hands?
- Serena!

- Serena?

She was running to Barry... in his car.
I'm so sorry, Laura.

Okay.
There she is.
Where did she go?
Wait!

Go back!
HHold it.

Zoom in.
I need to talk to him.
Clear to air in five, four, three, two...
I don't know why you took my Serena.
Maybe it's because you wanted to prove how foolish and arrogant I was for thinking I could catch you.
I was.

I'm talking to you... because you're somebody's son, maybe somebody's father.
And I'm begging you not to hurt her.
Have mercy on her.
Send her home safe and alive.
And if you can't... if you can't let go of your anger... take me.
Do whatever you want with me.
Take me instead aand just send Serena back to her father, who loves her.
I don't care about the governor or the death penalty.
I just want my baby back.
Please.
Please.
This criminal announced his crime as a personal challenge to me.
And I vow, as a father, that I will rise to that challenge.
I will see that this monster and all who take the lives of innocents pay the highest price.
These were found in her pockets.
Do you recognize them?
Serena... she didn't draw that.
That... that... the ssnakes and thorns, she's never drawn anything like that.
What about the safety pin?
It was caught in her sweater.
SShe wasn't wearing a safety pin last night.
What about this?
What is that?

They're marsh harebell.
They're found in swamps...

They might help tell us where...
Wait.

She never plays with cars.
She hates all that.
It is tragic that it took the death of Serena Price, a child who could have been our own granddaughter, to end the footdragging.
I am instructing the Department of Corrections to recommence executions effective immediately.
Through a careful process of discussion, the first to be executed will be Daniel Jackson, a man guilty of murdering two young women...
A heartbreaking scene today at Black Pine Cove, where a local fisherman discovered the body of missing Serena Price, the daughter of District Attorney Tom Price.
Your daddy's going to Heaven, sweetheart.
And when he gets there... he'll have Serena to keep him company.
There's no such place as Heaven.
So Serena ccan't be there, wwhich means she's here.
She's right here.

She's...

What you are doing?
I can't see them every day.
Then don't come in here.
They should go to children who are gonna use them.
You don't have the right to make that decision on your own.
I can't do this the way you're doing it.
Your way is better?
Three months... grieving time's up?
Time to act like she never existed?
Is that what you think I'm doing?
How dare you!
Um... every time I look at you, I think...
That I sent Serena downstairs with my assistant when I knew there was a killer in the city... a killer my show was going after.
That's not what I was going to say.
I thought I could carry you through this.
I hoped we could carry each other, but... we can't.
Mom.
They're killing him... at 7:00... in one hour.
Please come... ffor Ruby.

There's no time to pick you up.

Bless you.
Whoa, whoa.

My wife finally coughed up your name, Mr. Jackson.
I envy you, my friend.
Today, you will cross the veil and discover the answer to the great mystery.
Listen for one second.
If you kill me, my mother loses two sons today.
It'll do her in.
You really want to kill somebody's mother?
Everybody has a mother.
And everybody dies.
Mommy's coming, angel.
You won't be alone anymore.

Looks like we really surprised her?
Don't say anything until you blow the candles out, or the wish won't come true.
Is it...
Is it really you?
Who else would it be?
Mommy, let go!

OOOkay.

Isn't Mommy gonna blow out the candles?
She'll blow them out later.

Hey.

What happened to you?
Did you walk through a sprinkler?
It's impossible.
She died.
- Who died?

We...

Whoever you are, whatever you are... thank you for giving me back my Serena.
Hey.
Hey.
You want to tell me about your swim?
Mom, Mom!

Yeah?
Looks like a regular, normal pen, right?
Looks like a regular, normal pen, right?
Wrong!
Press this button, and it's... a laser death ray.
Pew, pew!
It's...
I love it.
Dad, have you seen my journal?
It's over on the windowsill.
Did you peek?
I swear on all the hobbits in The Shire, I didn't.
Stop!

No, you'll read it!
Go around the rug!
- Sweetie!

Okay, no glass.
I'll fix you up.

Everything's the same.
What are you talking about?
City in terror as the killer claims a fourth victim in a grim replay of... city in terror and the killer claims... an alltoo familiar scenario.
He's killing them.
Ilt's all happening the same.
You will soon lose something more precious to you than anything in the world.
That is your fate... written in stone a million years before you were born.
Mom.
Why are you acting so weird today?
I am not gonna let anybody hurt you this time.
I swear to you on my life.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
No!
Fate is your enemy.

The only way is to fight her headon.
Baby, this time I'll save you.
