I'm always lucky!
You said you weren't coming back.
Thought you'd gone and found God, like the rest of the losers.
Well.
I'm back.
Let's see you play.
I could beat you with three cards.
No changes.
Blind.
Ten grand says not.
Twenty.
Come on.
Who'll have twenty grand on that?
Live a little.
Yeah, okay, I'm in.
What am I gonna do now?
Shit!
You're late, Harvey.
You're not the one standing with four hundred K on them.
No, I am the one bringing the smack into the country.
So, if I can keep my shit together, so can you.
Mr. Harvey.
Who are you?
You don't know me, but I know you.
The police suspect you of killing four people, but the heroin you distributed has taken the lives of many more.
Therefore your life is forfeit.
Damn.
You, I don't know...
But I'm gonna guess that you deserve a bullet too.
Go on, give us your best shot.
S02E08 The Fallen Angel
Morning.
Hey.
You're up early.
I always am.
Found the coffee.
I had a great time last night.
I'll be five minutes.
Can't imagine there was anyone else here with them.
We don't know that.
Maybe a rival gang took 'em out.
Right, yeah, of course.
Come on, Sherlock.
I'm now retrieving a snub nosed nine millimetre bullet from the cranium of our as yet unidentified John Doe.
Which would be consistent with the short recoil semi-automatic pistol found at the scene.
I previously extracted a forty five from the neck of Andrew Harvey, which belonged to the single action revolver.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
That we caught a break?
One of the biggest heroin dealers in London and we're nowhere close to shutting him down.
Then somebody else does the job for us.
Ralph, so you think Andrew Harvey was killed with the single-action revolver?
Almost certainly.
Can I err...
Whose prints are on the revolver?
Ah, that's just in.
Andrew Harvey.
Oh?
So, the semi-automatic belonged to John Doe?
They didn't shoot each other.
They shot themselves.
What are the chances?
I got your calling card.
You're such a narcissist.
Do you think everything is about you?
I'm not hiding.
Use your bracelet, walk into any bar at random, and I'm sure you'll be lucky.
Just tell me where you are.
You're not above the law.
Of course I am.
And you should be grateful that I'm finishing the work your little team are failing to.
That's why you're sleeping with Winter?
To gain access to our case files?
You care who I have sex with now.
Leave our cases alone.
It's what the bracelets are for, Harry.
You're a psychopath.
Died from an overdose at sixteen.
And you have failed to catch the dealer.
We are preparing a case!
Matthew Hamilton.
You just can't prove anything, can you?
Look at him.
Do you know how many people are unlucky enough to die from choking each year?
The statistics are shocking.
I'm warning you.
What?
Are you going to arrest me?
On what charge?
You can punish all the guilty people in the world, it won't bring your daughters back.
Oh my God.
Someone help.
Come on!
Thanks, mate!
I thought I was a goner!
Go home.
We haven't eaten yet.
Whatever.
People I owe to now, they're serious people, people you don't want to mess with.
I, I don't know how the debt got so bad.
Seventy-seven and a half grand?
Where am I gonna find that?
So, I tell, I tell myself the only way I'm gonna make that money back is to gamble, which is insane, I know, but then, then this perfect bet comes up.
Like, dream odds and I lose more.
You!
You did this to me!
Stay away from me.
I can help you.
You gonna give me my twenty grand back?
That's not the answer.
It wouldn't matter if you did.
I owe money, like really big money.
I can help you.
Have you got seventy-seven and a half grand?
What am I gonna do?
You're not alone.
You know, call me, call any one of these guys.
We're your first line of defence.
What if you're in too deep?
Give me your mobile number.
Am I looking after Daisy?
No.
Where's Rich?
I asked him to give us some space.
Is this an intervention?
I don't want to stop you gambling.
Pick one.
Twenty thousand pounds.
Thirty thousand.
So, it's true?
Everything you told me about that bracelet is true.
It's two thousand years old.
If there was an instruction manual, it's long gone.
It's not a charm, Anna.
It's a curse!
Why?
Because for every bit of good luck that happens to me, someone close to me gets hurt.
And it really can't come off?
Only when I die.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
So, what happens now?
Morning, Harry.
I hope you've had your breakfast.
Jesus.
Don't feel too sorry for him, have a look at this.
Did you hear about Matthew Hamilton?
Slipped on an olive.
Could we be any luckier?
This carries on, we're gonna win Clean Up Rate of the Year award without lifting a finger.
You burnt a man?
What kind of sick bastard are you?
Well, I have no idea what you're talking about, but you have my full attention.
You're seriously trying to tell me you weren't responsible for this?
That's exactly what I just told you.
Excellent, Harry.
So, is this a competition?
Shall we see who can bring this killer to justice first?
Isabella?
Shit!
Err, John Doe, male, his nose piercing survived the petrol tank going up, but that's about all that did.
ID?
DNA extraction at these temperatures is fiddly.
I've just got a new bit of new kit, a Phenol Chloroform Extractor, could be just the ticket.
I've been wanting to give it a whirl.
How long to get a result?
Not fast enough, Ralph.
It's Clayton, I want you to run a plate through the PNC.
So... any plans this weekend?
Depends how long this goes on.
Harry's taking me for dinner tonight.
Sorry Ralph, you're not gonna get to use your new toy.
Our barbecued friend is Damien Richards.
Loan shark, arrests for assault and suspected murder.
Let's find out who might have owed him money.
I'm almost done here, do you mind waiting here for a moment?
Of course not.
Okay.
This is one of my officers, Steve Orwell.
My err, girlfriend, can I say that?
I think you just did.
Err, Ralph's managed to pull some prints off the passenger door of Damien Richard's car.
The man who left them is now our number one suspect.
Alright err, stick it on the board and let Harry know.
So, I just have to run upstairs and see the Commander.
Make yourself comfortable.
Steve?
We got some prints off the burnt-out car.
We're looking for a Bill Martin.
No address yet but we're working on it.
I've just sent you his photo.
Nice one, Steve.
Eve.
I need you to track the location of a phone.
Don't you have that little doe-eyed sergeant to run around after you?
Isabella has access to MIS records,
I can't risk her getting to this guy before me.
What makes you think I can get the address?
Because you're beautiful and resourceful and hate Isabella more than I do.
Give me twenty-four hours.
You've got five minutes.
Sorry about that.
Don't worry.
I actually just had a call from a friend, she's in a mess.
I think I really need to give her some moral support.
Is it okay if we meet later?
I'll see you later.
His GPS shows him in a warehouse in White City.
Thanks.
Rich, this is not a great time...
Your mate Suri's here.
She said you promised to take her out for dinner.
I've been held up at work.
Brilliant.
I'll join you later.
You're a police officer?
Did you owe Damien Richards, seventy seven and a half thousand pounds?
Bill.
Bill!
Bill!
Stop, this is stupid!
Bill.
I know why you killed him.
It's time to stop running.
Bill.
Don't!
I was scared, my DNA was all over that car, you couldn't understand.
Why?
Because you've messed things up so badly you can't put them right?
What's gonna happen to my family if I go to prison?
If I die, at least they get the insurance.
That's no consolation, Bill, for any of them.
Take my hand.
Okay.
Harry!
That's it.
Sorry, I'll switch it off.
It's fine, take it.
Yes.
You will go down for this.
I will see that you spend the rest of your natural life rotting in a cell.
I know it feels unfair now, because you liked him, but you'll see that everything will turn out the way it's meant to.
He didn't deserve to die!
I'll call you later.
Is she okay?
Bless her, she will be fine.
Destroy it!
You can't do this.
I have no choice.
No, you can't do this.
The law can't touch her, I'm the only person who can.
I'll do it.
It's my responsibility.
But you put this one on mine.
Please.
I'll have the paella, please.
Me too.
Cheer up, probably made a lucky escape.
He's a disaster to date.
What?
To be honest, you probably shouldn't be dating your boss, should you?
Particularly not one who's still in love with his ex.
We're just mates.
Right.
I'm not dating anyone at work, again.
Trust me and if I was, it wouldn't be Harry Clayton.
What's that supposed to mean?
What's wrong with my brother?
Brilliant.
Whatever you do, however you try to get his attention,
Harry's never going to love you.
Rise and shine.
Oh, Holy shit!
Morning...
Morning!
Can I ask you what your intentions are towards my brother?
Only, he's a delicate flower, I wouldn't like to see him get hurt.
I'm not going to date your brother, that would be too weird.
Is he single though?
What do you care if you're not going to date him?
I don't.
Is he though?
The victim's the same guy who left his prints on Damien Richards' car.
He kills Damien Richards, someone kills him.
It's not a pretty sight.
Bill Martin kills his loan shark, then he's killed.
So, what do we think?
Revenge?
Damien Richards' brother's got form.
Sergeant!
We have started.
I've been onto Bill Martin's mobile phone provider.
Sir, perhaps I should talk to you about this in private.
About his phone records?
No, tell me now.
The last number he called is registered to an Isabella Augustine, Villa Mansions, West London.
Do you know a man named Bill Martin?
No.
Well, he called your mobile yesterday.
I don't think so.
Did you have your phone on you all day?
I did, and I certainly didn't speak to anyone named Bill.
It's just according to his service provider, there was a call between his mobile and yours for approximately two minutes.
And what does it matter that he called me?
Bill Martin was murdered yesterday.
Would you mind if we had a look around?
We won't get the DNA results for a while, but it's a match for
Bill Martin's blood type.
A search of the area surrounding Isabella Augustine's apartment block, produced this in a commercial bin down the street.
The blood is also a match for Bill Martin's blood type.
Well, erm... obviously I need to recuse myself from... this situation.
Harry, will you lead?
I'm afraid I need to recuse myself as well.
I only just realised when I saw her photo, but I know Isabella.
Only by her first name.
We both go to the same organisation that... helps us deal with our gambling issues.
It protects its members anonymity.
That's why I didn't recognise her surname.
Isabella is in Gamblers' Anonymous?
The victim was a member too.
Did they know each other?
I've seen them at the same meetings.
Alistair, I'm sorry.
I feel like I hardly know her.
Everyone's capable of murder.
First law of our job.
How can you subject me to this?
You don't get it, do you?
This is the kindest way I could deal with you.
It's mercy.
Something you showed none of your victims.
I don't want that mercy.
No, what I'm saying is, stop shutting me out.
About Daisy, about your marriage
I mean, it's like suddenly I don't have clearance.
Well, to be honest, my family doesn't have anything to do with you.
Oh God.
Anna, it's Harry!
Actually, I'm here to see Daisy.
I'm never letting you help me do my homework again.
It's alright, Jonny's helped me do my GCSE chemistry.
Got me an A.
Well, that's because Jonny's just finished doing his GCSE's himself.
Does that happen a lot?
I really don't know.
I did something terrible today.
I planted evidence on someone, they're guilty, but
no police officer would ever be able to prove it.
Isabella.
Well, what do you expect?
You told me to keep away from her, so, of course I went to see her.
She convinced me that the bracelet was real.
She could've killed you.
She's unbalanced.
Yeah, I gathered that.
I'm fine, it's you I'm worried about.
I feel like I've crossed a line.
So,
what's new?
I am the victim of false evidence, implicating me in a crime of which I am entirely innocent.
I have provided proof for all my exact movements through the last twenty-four hours, including an extended period of time in the company of your detective superintendent.
DSI Winter has recused himself from this investigation.
So, let's continue.
Ralph, how sure are you Bill Martin's watch broke during the attack?
Well, it's impossible to be a hundred percent, but it's very common damage from a defensive move.
Why is this relevant?
Because if Bill Martin's watch got smashed while he was being murdered, then how did he call Isabella Augustine thirty minutes later?
Sir...
Look, if this is about the Isabella Augustine case,
I can't hear about it.
You should see this.
This is a forensic time line of Bill Martin's death and this is a time line of Isabella Augustine's movements.
How sure are you of this time of death?
So far, we've have a stopped watch.
Well, that's not good enough, not nearly good enough.
But I went through the CCTV on the street where the murder weapon was found.
Do you think that's the murder weapon?
It could be.
This is the same motorcyclist leaving Isabella's apartment.
This is the same woman, we saw driving away from the warehouse where Bill Martin's body was found.
Why would this woman want to frame Isabella?
Her name is Eve Alexandri.
I tried to help her get some clean time, but the draw of the casinos was too great for her.
She couldn't forgive me for getting clean.
I didn't realise it for a long time, but she has psychotic episodes.
She believed that I had an ability to control where the roulette ball would land.
It's ridiculous, I know.
She threatened to destroy my life if I didn't share my 'powers' with her.
Get me the custody sergeant.
I should go.
I don't want Daisy to find us here.
I think she'd be pleased.
Yeah.
But I don't want to get her hopes up, until we sort out what we want.
What do you want?
I've never made any secret of that.
It's still early, you know.
I could take you out for dinner.
Alright.
Thanks.
Look, I'm really sorry about what happened.
Oh, don't worry about it.
You were all just doing your job.
I'll let you know as soon as they've apprehended Alexandri.
Good.
Shall we have dinner?
I'd love that.
There's one or two errands I need to run though.
Lunch tomorrow?
I'd like that.
Me too.
Harry, it's me.
I'm off duty, Suri.
I need to talk to you about Eve Alexandri.
I think she framed Isabella Augustine for the murder of Bill Martin.
Have you told this to anyone else?
Do you think Eve Alexandri killed Bill Martin?
Oh shit!
Harry?
Slow down, Harry!
I'm trying, the brakes!
Do not get out of the car.
What's going on?
Harry?
Show yourself!
I know you're here!
Harry, what the hell are you doing?
Stay in the car!
Oh no.
No... he's dead.
