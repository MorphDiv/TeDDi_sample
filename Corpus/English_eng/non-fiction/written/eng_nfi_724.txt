It's right here.
That fire was intentionally set.
This was mass murder.
Dr. Halstead!
Do something.
Get another blood gas, drop her tidal volume to 300, and increase her rate to 25, and up the PEEP to 10.
Lexi...
It's okay.
Her chest can't expand to accommodate the breath from the vent.
Yeah.
Scalpel.
[beeping]
Air pressures are coming down.
Sats are coming up.
All right.
Al.
Tell me.
She's in critical condition.
[crying]
Can I see her?
I need to see her.
This is Meredith, Lexi's mom.
This is Dr. Halstead, Jay's brother.
So Lexi has burns over 60% of her body.
Ohh, what?
We had to make incisions in the burned area of Lexi's chest to improve her ability to breathe.
I'll continue to update you every step of the way.
We're gonna do our best.
Come on.
Take a seat.
Hey, take care of her.
You take good care of her.
Hey.
Now you find whoever set that fire, and I want him alone.
Detectives and arson investigators from across the city will not rest until the individual or individuals responsible are brought to justice.
This cowardly act has robbed many of our Chicago citizens of their future.
I'm being told that the structure was a home to many young and talented artists.
If those responsible are watching this, they're about to feel the full strength and scope of the Chicago Police Department.
Any questions?
Antonio.
The entire State's Attorney's office and investigators are at your disposal.
Just have your people in Felony Review
But when I get this case file, it's got to be legit, by the numbers and tight.
Hey, Sarge!
Whoever did this when they exited... they jammed these metal wedges underneath the door.
Sergeant.
Find the son of a bitch who did this.
[footsteps approaching]
I got a relief sergeant to cover the front desk
Uh, these are our 36 DOAs.
And the 18 over there are in the ICU at Med.
She has an ex-con named Nathan Delano who did 18 years for arson and attempted homicide in Stateville because he lit his family on fire back in 1998.
Including three of his own children.
So this guy failed to report in yesterday.
She marked him down for the violation, but his last known address was 4133 South Wells.
That's six blocks from the Kimball Factory.
There's a active warrant out for his arrest.
4133 South Ida.
Advise responding, there are plain clothes officers on the scene.
Ready, boys?
Hey!
All right.
Many of the victims had only recently moved to Chicago.
Family members are still arriving from around the country, heartbroken, searching for answers.
[gunshots]
Son of a bitch.
[footsteps fleeing]
Stop!
[grunts]
Get off of me.
Get up!
That's not Delano.
Oh, no, no, no.
[grunting]
What is your problem?
Lane Cromwell.
He and Nathan Delano were cellmates
He's wanted on an extraditable felony warrant from St. Louis.
He beat a cab driver half to death.
Priors for unlawful restraint, aggravated battery, assaulting a police... you get the idea.
Mm.
Yeah, I'm gonna head back upstairs.
I know you know who I am.
I know I'm going back to prison for the rest of my life.
You got nothing to offer me.
That's a fair point.
Fair point.
Aaron.
He's doing six years at Menard, isn't that right?
Yeah, it says here he's in, uh, administrative segregation.
Apparently he's having some problems in gen pop.
I don't know, but, uh, judging by his intake photo, I'm guessing he's just... just a little too fetching.
You can't touch him.
You wanna hear something really funny?
The warden at Menard used to be my Deputy Chief.
See, his wife, she wanted to move out to the country, so he took the warden gig and she finally got her garden.
So I'd say inside of 30 minutes, I could have your baby brother tossed in that yard like a little dog treat.
[kisses]
I don't know where Nathan is.
He packed a bag real quick and drove off two minutes before your cop buddies rolled up.
Did he torch that warehouse?
Did he torch that warehouse?
So why'd he blow off his check-in with his parole officer yesterday?
He'd been using.
He knew he wouldn't pass the piss test, so we were gonna skip town.
Head up to Alaska, where a buddy of mine owns a fishing boat.
Okay, what's he driving?
What's he driving?
Suit yourself.
A '94 green Toyota.
Stolen out of Wisconsin.
So here's what we're up against, boss.
The warehouse was without any residential permits, so there's no records, no lease agreements, no video cameras and the person who knew the most was the owner, Barry Kimball, who shot himself in the face
yesterday at Firehouse 51.
Right, Delano's previous arson, he tried to kill his own family members.
So it's a good bet if he's behind this one, he has some personal connection to someone inside.
He doubled his policy.
Insurance scam?
Somehow crosses paths with Delano and then gets him to torch the place.
It says he has a live-in girlfriend, Stacia Mulaney.
She almost came home.
We had lunch last week.
I said, you know, you've given this guy two years.
It's time, you know, to pursue your own dreams.
And so I went back that next day and she had her bag packed.
So I opened the car door but, uh, she just shook her head.
She was crying.
You know, she couldn't leave him.
"He needs me, Dad."
[sighs]
This is a nightmare.
Yeah, for a lot of people.
Barry was just trying to help.
They were artists and musicians who couldn't afford regular rent.
You know, they made a community there.
Do either of these men look familiar to you?
No.
Why did Barry take out extra insurance on the warehouse
He kept me out of that stuff.
When he killed himself at the firehouse, he had an unregistered gun.
Why would he be walking around with that?
He was being threatened.
Threatened about what?
Like I said, Barry kept me out of all of that stuff.
Okay, Stacia, I'm gonna ask you something and I'm only gonna ask once.
Do you know who was after your boyfriend or who could have started that fire?
No.
Okay.
We'll be in touch.
Yeah.
[computer beeping]
I got a hit.
I ran the Wisconsin plate on Delano's stolen Toyota through NVLS plate reader and got two consecutive hits, both indicating the 3400 block of Pulaski.
All right, Lindsay and Halstead should be right there.
Here.
- [gunshots] - [grunting, shouting]
Get out of the way!
[grunts]
- [grunts] - [horn blaring]
Stop, police!
[tires screeching]
5021 George.
Armed offender fleeing westbound on 29th Street.
Get me some cars!
Out of the way!
[grunts]
Do not move!
Let it go!
Hey, partner, are you all right?
Jay, are you there?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Offender didn't make it.
We were able to pull some video off one of the phones recovered from the warehouse.
[indistinct chatter]
[explosion booming] [screaming]
Okay, back it up.
That guy was leaving fast.
Stop.
Zoom in.
That's our killer.
Yep.
We're up to 38.
So based on the proximity of the suspect to the stairs... which we measured at the warehouse... he should be about 5'9, figure 150 pounds.
And how tall was Delano?
Oh, Delano was a little over six feet.
[cell phone buzzing]
Hey, guys, um, so there's gonna be a candlelight vigil tonight at the warehouse.
At 8:00, FYI.
So the block the warehouse is on.
Strings signify security cameras from private companies and what angles they access.
All right, I want footage going back one month.
And I want access to all these cameras.
Hey, it's my C.I. I'll be right back.
Yeah, man, you know the dude who owned
You know, we know each other 'cause I used to supply some folks who live in the warehouse.
That's why I called you.
Well, he hit me up a couple weeks ago.
Wanted me to take care of a situation for him.
You know, turns out, these dudes were trying to shake him for some money.
Wanted me to step in, intervene,
When did I ask you for information
Honestly, I think somewhere down the line, a miscommunication developed between us and I take full responsibility for that.
I give you cash and keep your ass out of jail.
Of course.
Thirty-eight people died, Rashad.
You can't slow walk this to me six hours later, bro.
I swear on everything I love, if that happens again, your life is gonna change.
Now, you were saying.
Look, this dude named K.D. was trying to shake Kimball down, man.
I never saw the dude.
Just told me to be ready.
He might about to put the ball in K.D.'s court.
[alarm sounding]
She's bradying down.
Milligram of Atropine.
Stats are down to single digits.
[flatline sounding]
[speaking indistinctly]
I'll be right back.
Will.
Now, I've had to give a lot of notifications to family over the years, so I know how hard it is.
So you don't have to sugar coat anything for me.
All right?
Okay, so... is Lexi gonna make it?
Her heart already stopped.
And, uh, we were able to get it going again.
She's in multi-organ failure.
There's just nothing more we can do.
I'm so sorry, Al.
[flatline sounding]
Lexi died 20 minutes ago.
So we can mourn when the scumbag who did this is in cuffs.
Till then, what do we got?
The lab did an enhancement on the suspect leaving the warehouse.
They were able to identify the logo on the right shoulder of the suspect's jacket.
The brand is ForeRange.
The cargo jacket looks like the one the suspect is wearing.
There's five retail stores in Chicago that carry the brand.
They're sending me the last six months of security footage and all their cash and their credit card transactions.
All right, Kev, what's up with the tip you got on K.D.?
Yeah, we got 85 registered gang bangers with those initials in our database.
And I cross-referenced the initials K.D.
with everyone who's contacted Kimball's phone.
Nothing.
These are all in-service calls and any paper generated on the warehouse.
Most of the calls came from the same landline.
She's made over 40 suspicious persons calls.
The last was three nights ago and she lives down the block from the warehouse.
You and Jay.
This is how it always happens.
Y'all don't show up until it hits the fan.
Uh, Detectives Lindsay and Halstead.
And before you leave, I wanna get the correct spelling of your names, your badge numbers, and what unit you're assigned to.
Not a problem, ma'am.
We're here about the warehouse fire.
The gentleman who owned it was named Barry...
I know who he is.
And he packed them damn kids in there like sardines.
Treated them about as good, too.
Did you notice anything the night of the fire?
I was sitting in that window, and I could see it all.
This man kept thumping Barry's chest like this.
And I told that old hair bag Officer Keating when he finally showed up 45 minutes later.
But did Officer Keating follow up with me?
Hell no.
Okay, any other details about the man?
A little shorter than you, looked like...
How much shorter?
Oh, so you interrupt people.
But he was in his 20s, though.
And I got his license plate number.
Any chance you have security cameras?
But I got eyeballs.
And that guy had been by here three times to talk to Barry.
He was bringing nothing but bad news.
Next thing you know, 39 young people get called home way before their time.
I'll go get you that license plate number.
Appreciate it.
26 years old, 5'8, 170 pounds.
No criminal history, though.
Thank you very much for your help.
Finally, a cop does something in this city.
Lock him into the area, dump his phone, run his vehicle.
I want everything on this prick before we move on him.
Al.
We're so sorry.
Thanks.
Alvin, do you wanna get some coffee?
Or maybe talk to the chaplain or... or Peer Support?
No, I just wanna know what's going on with this case.
Well, we're, uh, we're moving in on a suspect.
But it's nothing rock solid yet.
Okay.
Yeah.
Do you have a reservation?
It's all good.
I'm looking for the Davis party and I'm wondering if they're here.
Just tell me where they are.
Thank you.
Stay right here.
Yeah.
You need to stand up for me.
I'd like to know what this is about.
The hell do you think you're doing?
Hands up.
Hey, you can't go in there, buddy.
No, but just...
Look, the observation room, that's it.
I got it.
Come on, man.
Huh.
Quite the family tree you got.
[door closes]
So your Uncle Patty, he was a Ward Superintendant till he got swept up in Operation Silver Shovel for felony theft and racketeering.
The paperwork says he flipped on a couple of aldermen for a reduction in sentence.
He got pinched for bribes, money laundering, threatening a witness.
What am I doing here?
Barry Kimball.
Don't know him.
Hmm.
So... you're gonna deny to my face
knowing or interacting with Barry Kimball, whose warehouse got torched.
That's what I said.
[grunts]
Here's what I think went down:
You tried to squeeze money out of Kimball.
Told him you'd rat him out to the city 'cause you have connections.
And he refused to pay or he stopped paying.
So you went back to your dirtbag relatives for advice and they told you you had to get tough.
So you went back to that warehouse during that rave and you torched that place.
I...
Kid... if the next thing out of your face is, "I don't know Barry Kimball,"
we're gonna go for a ride.
And no way did I light that place up.
[clattering]
Yeah, your brother operated on Lexi.
So please tell him I said thanks.
I know he gave it everything he had.
Yeah.
All right, I want a full work-up on this guy.
And she wants to talk.
Oh.
Sweetheart, the police are here.
Hi, Tamra.
My name is Erin Lindsay and Kim Burgess is here, as well.
You had something you wanted to tell us.
Yes.
I was there at the rave.
And this guy stood... stood next to me.
He was wearing a dark jacket and a... and a hat.
And he was holding a paper bag.
He walked over to the side and he... he dropped the paper bag on the floor.
And then stepped on it.
Then he kicked it behind the couch.
He... he started to walk away and then the bag burst into flames.
Do you remember anything else about him?
Uh, he was a little bit taller than me.
So, 5'8, maybe.
And a white guy.
In his 20s.
He had a... a silver skull ring on his right hand.
That's really good.
Is there anything else, or...
Yeah, he... he had blue eyes.
[crying]
When he looked at me, it was like he was looking right through me.
Thank you.
All right, we're looking for a male, white, 20-25, owns a brown ForeRange cargo jacket.
He wears a silver skull ring on his right hand, he's about 5'8, and he has blue eyes.
We'll run everyone in the city with that description.
All DMV, city, county, and state employees, anyone with a public record.
Kick Kade Davis?
Charge him with the gun first.
So we're nowhere.
You got that vigil in an hour, Sarge.
All right, everybody get ready.
Halstead, coming to you, brother.
Headed north.
Yeah, you can stop right there.
[gun cocks]
Put him in the cage.
Call Felony Review, get a warrant.
Chicago PD!
It's clear.
Clear.
Metal wedges.
[sighs]
I work with a detective...
I mean, he's a... he's a really good friend of mine.
You killed his daughter in that fire.
I mean, she just... she had a glow.
A chief at CFD, he told me arsonists like to return to the scene of the crime, but I had a real strong hunch you would anyway.
Because I know this crime was personal.
You wanted to hurt someone 'cause someone hurt you.
Tell me if I'm wrong.
[grunts] Tell me if I'm wrong!
Who pissed you off, huh?
Who broke your little heart?
I have the right to remain silent.
I understand that right and I do not wish to speak with you.
You're gonna tell me why you lit that fire.
Believe me.
Or you're gonna feel pain like you never imagined was possible.
I'm gonna turn him over to the state's attorney...
Huh?
Would you have let anybody stop you if they tried?
We got 39 families looking for justice, not just one.
Oh, so you don't think that they'd be happy to hear that this animal was dredged out of the river?
I don't know that!
I don't know that, and neither do you.
And that's why it's gotta go down this way.
Well, then you're gonna have to go through me to get him out.
Al.
[indistinct chatter, jeering]
