Is it really that bad?
Yes.
I can't wear that.
Do you know how many photos they take at weddings?
But, as maid of honor, it's your job to do everything your Mom wants.
Yeah, but if I believed that, there'd be none of this... or this...
- Zoë?

- Do you have the play budget?

Uh, Rasha was just helping me... massage it.
Thanks.
Nice dress.
I can't believe we nearly got caught again.
We are so bad at keeping secrets.
You know, Goldi might be okay with us.
But if she isn't and she tells her parents,
- they might kick me out.

I just can't believe how cool my mom's been about it.
I mean, she didn't even mention the kiss.
And she didn't even flinch when I mentioned my girlfriend.
You have a girlfriend?

Uh, are we not there yet?
Depends.

Yes.

If I'm wearing that dress, my Mom owes me big.
On second thought, I'm not sure I want to be seen with you in that.
It's Friday night.

How do you want to kick off the weekend, bro?

The only thing I plan on stretching is my hand in a chip bowl.
Uh, besides, don't you have a boyfriend?

Uh, no, we did not.

- A what?

It's when two people take some time and space to figure out what they want.
I think me and Yael might be on a break.
Um, what happens if the other person realizes that what they want is just more space?
Well, everyone says that distance makes the heart grow fonder.
Okay, so what if you see them in the hallway?
Are you just supposed to pretend they don't exist?
I don't know.

Hey, Frankie.
Hey, Jonah.
Fancy seeing you here, in the school we both attend.
This has been great.

But Hunter and I actually have a family engagement we need to get to.
Right, Hunter?

So that was cool.
How do you think he seemed?
The way he always does.

Do you think he wants the break to be over?
Don't ask me.

Besides, shouldn't you be figuring out what you want?
One minute, I was on the bench.

- Do you think it was a hallucination?

Well, the Internet says hallucinations can be symptoms of a brain tumor.
That would explain the changes in my personality, right?
It could.
So what's next?

I may have spent all night on WebMD.
Sit down, Maya.
Now, your weight's dropped quite a bit.
- What's your appetite been like?

Have you been tired?
Just rip the Band-Aid off, Doc.

Maya, I think you're depressed.
No.
This isn't like last time.

Depression's a disease that can take many forms.
And, like cancer, it needs intense treatment to fix.
Okay, so there's a magic pill I can take?
We may try medication, but I would also recommend lots of therapy.
But I already did that and it didn't work.
You guys said it was over, and it's not.
Depression's a life-long battle.
But look at the bright side.
Now that we know what's wrong, we can fix it.
Okay, we've picked up your dress and your shoes.
Oh, and I have to, uh, confirm the AV equipment.
You told your friends no heavy metal, right?
Grace and Jonah are taking this DJ job very seriously.
- And thanks for letting them do it.

It's not my wedding.

You, Phil, and I are becoming a family.
Does that mean I can pick our bridesmaid dress?
Sometimes we make sacrifices for the people we love.
Like allowing them to add a last-minute plus-one to the guest list?
Oh, hon, you know how the venue is about capacity.
- But Rasha really wants to come.

So it's not really our wedding.
Honey, you don't wanna out yourself in front of the relatives.
Because it might ruffle some feathers?
No, 'cause you're not gay.
Come on, look at you.

You're just confused.
You saw me kiss Rasha, right?
And I've seen you also kiss a lot of boys.
Sweets, don't worry.
Someday, you will meet Mr. Right, and you will...
You'll forget all about this little phase, okay?
What's next on the list?
Oh, yeah!

And, uh, after, I need to go to the tailor to pick up Phil's suit.
I know what you're thinking.

Yael says I need to earn back her trust, but she won't tell me how.
What am I supposed to do, read her mind?
You should read this book.
I'm finding it very illuminating.
Break-Up or Breakthrough?
It's actually explaining why we have problems with our relationships.
Dad.
Mmm.

It suggests we use the CAT technique to build trust.
We could try it on Yael.
But, first, you'd need to tell me why you two are having trouble.
On second thought, what has anyone ever learned from a book?
Okay, CAT technique.
C. Start with a compliment.
You look pretty today.
"You look pretty today."
Oh, okay.

Okay, A. Apologize and accept responsibility.
"I'm sorry.

Mmm, no, not "hard."
"Confusing."
"Because I love you."
"Yes."
Okay.

The moment you opened this book.
Very funny.
Look, Dr. Narello said these exercises would help you understand your feelings.
I feel like this book is a waste of time.
I'm not depressed.
- I know it's hard to accept.

Why are you siding with that stupid doctor?
Because I just want to fix you.
Well, I'm not broken.
That's not what I said.

Oh, so now I'm ridiculous?
You just don't like the way I am right now, so you want some stupid disease to blame it on.
Honey, please.

- You have to see...

Let's do this later.

No, you're the one that started it!
Admit it.

That's not you talking, it's the disease!

Oh, stop talking about the stupid book, Mom.
- I hate it!

That mirror was my grandmother's.
Whatever.
I always thought it was ugly.
I don't...

She's like a different person.
I mean, how did I let it get this bad?
I feel like I've failed as a parent.
No, it's okay, Mom.
I'm here now.

Maya?
Hey, munchkin.
What are you doing here?
Don't you have soccer practice?

Yeah, but what's more important than family time?
- You didn't have to ruin her life, too.

Okay.

Why don't we hang out today?

I can't.

- All right.

Hi, uh, have you seen Zoë?
Whoa!

I second-guessed my outfit a kajillion times.
I've never been out with a girlfriend.

Me, too.
There's my Mom.

Yeah.
Mom, this is my girlfriend, Rasha.
Ms. Rivas, you look beautiful.

Thank you so much for inviting me.
You should find yourself a spot.

Okay.
Go ahead.

Do you have the bouquet?

- Yes.

Have you seen Hunter?
I'm wondering how things are going between him and Yael.
Hmm?
- What are you doing?

"Hey, Jonah.

- I love you."

Because that would be a huge violation of personal privacy.
- I was just trying to help.

Miles, some support?
First, I need more info.
Frankie pretended to be me online to Yael.
And she forgave you.
- Because you told her I loved her.

- Doesn't mean I was ready to say it.

No!

I thought that maybe if I could fix things between you and Yael, maybe there'd be hope for me and Jonah.
That is really pathetic.
And it's too late.
What?
Jonah's gonna see this!
- He's gonna think I'm a crazy person.

I need to explain what happened.
- Well, he's at the Rivas wedding.

Good plan.
And I, Consuela Rivas, take this man, Phillip Hawthorne, to be my husband.
"Love is patient.

It does not envy.

It is not proud.

That's a lot of money.

Yeah.

Um, take care of Zig for me, okay?
Um, okay.
"Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."
You seem to have a visitor.
Frankie?
- Have you checked your DMs recently?

Good, 'cause I need to delete something.
- You think I'm pretty?

Oh, good.

Yeah, I always kinda thought we had a special connection.
- Okay.

What about the other thing?

You mean the "I love you"?
He wrote it.

And...

- Those words have never been easy for me.

And I need constant validation, which is probably why I tend to overthink things.
Even though we're a toxic couple...
I really miss you and I want our break to be over.
It's go time.
Call you later?
Do I smell popcorn?
With extra butter, and there's also soda and every type of candy known to womankind.
I thought we could have a movie night.
- Wizard of Oz?

Do I make the guest list?
You'll have to change first.
Yeah.

PJs, everyone.
I got matching ones.
Um, I fixed the mirror.

It looks perfect.
I'm sorry I've been such a burden lately.
- No.

Don't lie.
I know things have been hard.
But I'm gonna make it all better.
I have a plan.
Can't wait to hear it.
Okay, PJs, everyone.

May I have this dance?
So, what's with the new look, hmm?
You don't like it?
I do, but is it really you?
I'm sick of everyone second-guessing whether I'm gay because of my look.
- Do you like kissing me?

Then you're pretty darn gay.
I'm so glad you're here.
Zoë, what are you doing?
Dancing with my girlfriend.
Stop it.
Now, before everyone sees.
No.
I'm not gonna pretend to be someone I'm not.
Not for you.

Don't you dare turn this around on me!
I have done everything for you.
Except love me for who I am.
I love you despite who you are.
And then you bring this girl to my wedding after I said no?
You are so selfish!

You're the one who can't get over her stupid prejudices for her own daughter!
Okay.

Come on, just relax, okay?

Zoë, I think you should leave, okay?
You heard him.

Gladly.

It's okay.
Can you believe she called me selfish?

What?
You said I was welcome at the wedding.
Well, I wanted you there.
- But not your Mom.

Two years ago, I was invited to my aunt's for a party.
The police arrived to question me.

- This is not the same thing.

You put me in a situation where people hated me for being who I am.
Look, I'm not the bad guy here.

I don't trust you.
Can you call my phone to check if it's working?
Has that ever, in the history of time, been a problem?
Hey.
Uh, your Mom let me in.
- You brought me flowers?

It was one of the centerpieces.

I do.
Here.

Is that my inbox?
- Um...

- I...

Never mind.

Okay, I'm...

When you didn't call, I...

All year, you've second-guessed my feelings for you and I liked you enough to give it a pass.
Can you give me one more chance?
I mean, that was...

But this is a huge violation of my trust.
I...

And just to be clear, this is a breakup.

Wait!

Can we talk about this?
Well, I'd love to, but I have to go home and change my passwords.
You think she'll ever forgive me?
Your Mom?
Rasha.
It was stupid to bring her to the wedding after my Mom said no.
I thought if she saw us together... she'd be able to finally accept me.
- I never wanted to hurt anyone.

Now I have nothing.
No one.
So, now I'm nobody?
I spoke to my Mom.
You can stay with us for as long as you want.
Come on.

"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!"
I can't believe you still remember every word.
Of course.
I'm gonna hit the sack.
Mmm.

Or Katie could sleep in my room, like old times.
Oh, okay, if you insist.
But you'd better keep those ice cubes to yourself.
Deal.
But, first, I must floss.
I'm so tired.
Pee emergency.
We need more than one bathroom in this place.
- You okay?

I'm just happy you're here.

Hey, I love you, too, sis.
