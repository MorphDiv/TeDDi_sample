Fuck!
Oh, shit!
Hey!
- Hi.

- Don't step there.

- I gotta sweep that up.

Hey, did you notice last night, there was a point where I was spooning you and then you were spooning Grandpa?
It was so cute.
Oh, my God!
Bertie leaves half-eaten yogurt cups in here.
Who eats half a yogurt and then puts it back?
She is a small person, so...
Can I help?

Oh, well, my dad's coming to town, so I figured I'd clean.
Your dad?

Marty Dobbs, flying in from Jersey as we speak.
Wow.

Well, he didn't tell me until yesterday.
My dad's Mr. Casual.
But it's cool.

That's cool.

- Hmm.

Well, I was gonna meet him for lunch near the airport and bring him back here.
- Hmm.

Oh!

It'll be fun!
Please, please, please.

What else are you gonna do today, hmm?
I don't know.

I don't wanna intrude on time with your dad and...
Meeting a dad's kind of a big deal, don't you think?
Dude, no.

This will be easy.
My dad's kind of an asshole, but you'll like him and he'll love you.
I mean, compared to all the other guys he's met.
The last guy was on cat tranquilizers.
- Those work on humans?

Same as human ones.

So, what do you say, Cruikshank?

Uh... okay.
Yes, fine.
Why not?

Sweet!

Okay.

Oh, hey, Gus.
Bertie.

Why is everything different?
Oh, uh, Mickey's cleaning up.

I guess her dad's visiting.
- He is?

And, uh, I'm gonna go meet him.
- Oh, wow!

You think it's too soon?
Hmm.

- Oh, where'd my yogurt go?

Do you know where it went?
No.
- You look nice.

Oh, me too.
It would've been a bad first impression to meet your dad with me, like, reeking of sex.
Hmm.
Yeah.

Got any, uh, tips on meeting your dad?

- Mmm, not really.

He used to be a dentist, before he lost his license for giving out, uh, prescriptions of pain medications.
Oh.

Now he's a consultant, whatever that means.
- Hmm.

Uh, yeah, yeah.
When's the... when's the last time you guys saw each other?
Two, three years ago.
Oh.

I mean, it's not not a big deal, but it's not a big deal.
Do you two not...

Do you guys not get along, or...
No, it's not that.

I mean, he's my dad, so it'll always be a little complicated, but we're not, like, estranged or anything.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, don't worry, dads are kind of my specialty.
A lot of times an ex's dad will like me more than his daughter ever did.
That's fucked up.
Yeah, I realize that's probably not something I should brag about.
I'm guessing it's more of a turn on to be the bad boy anyway, right?
Not for me anymore.
Where is he?

Yeah.

You know, it probably takes a long time getting off the plane, and picking up your bags and... waiting in line for those taxis and stuff.
- That's probably him.

- Oh, shit.

- Hey, Dad!

Aw.

Ah, you look pretty good yourself.
Yeah, I do, don't I?
- Hello!

Sorry.

Nice to meet you, Marty.
Sorry, I'm a hugger.
- Gus, huh?

I only ever knew one other Gus.

Oh, yeah.
I think I, uh, met him last year at the, uh, Gus Convention.
He's not alive.
Oh.

Well, that's okay.

Yeah!
- Hey, can I take those for you?

Thank you.

- Eager little guy.

Isn't this place cool, Dad?

They're supposed to have the best samosas in LA.
Well, that's a bold statement, Mick.

So, uh, Marty, how was the flight?
Oh, my God.
They sat me next to a lady with one of these therapy dogs.
You heard about this?

I know.

Right after we take off, we hit a little turbulence.
This dog goes crazy.
Starts barking and whimpering and immediately takes a dump...
- Oh, my God.

- No!

I mean, they clean it up, but for five full hours, I am in dog shit hell.
People start looking at me like it's my dog.
- That's awful!

"Hey," you know, "Do I look like I'm a fucking bichon owner to you?"
No.

- You really don't...

Mick, you still got that cat?

Grandpa. 'Cause he's the reincarnation of Grandpa, remember?
Yeah.

Oh, Dad, um, I got a promotion at work.
I'm a program manager now at the radio station.
Really?

Hey, you always were good at hustling up work.
- Thanks.

See, there's something good you inherited from me.
It's in our blood.
Right.

So, Gus, what's your last name?
- Cruikshank.

What nationality is that?
Oh, it's, um, Scottish.

Uh, you know, I...

- What?

Ah!
Yeah, I get that sometimes.

No, no, I was, uh, I was actually raised Catholic.
- Well, you had me fooled.

Gus was raised in South Dakota and he teaches kid actors.
No kidding.
Have you ever heard of the show Witchita?
Yeah, the witch show, you bet.
Gus worked on that show.
- And... he wrote a script for them.

- No!

Great.
Good for you, Micks.
Got yourself a nice, hardworking guy with no tattoos or piercings.
I had a feeling you two would get along.
Better than the last guy.
Remember when he fell asleep at the table?
Have you decided?
Well, I've decided that you are a ray of sunshine.
What's your name?
Pema.
Pema, beautiful Pema, huh?

- It's good.

Good, all right, well, we are gonna start off with a couple orders of samosas.
And the tandoori shrimp, uh, steamed momo, the lamb tikka masala... and the chicken vindaloo.
Good choices.
Uh, are you sure, Dad?

I live large.

Hey, thank you.
So, uh, what brings you into town?
Oh, well, Southwest doesn't fly direct to San Francisco from where I live.
But I'm heading up to Palo Alto.
Got a meeting with an investor I think is going to help me out with this new app I've got.
Oh, okay.

It's like Uber, but better.
You know, it's the better Uber.
These things are all about right place, right time.
I mean, I've had guys rip me off, make money off my ideas, but that is not gonna happen this time.
Well, uh, I just wanna say, we're so glad to have you in town and, uh, maybe I'll get to find out a little bit more about what this one was like as a kid, huh?
- You got any, uh, funny stories?

- No.

- She ever tell you about the whip-its?

Seventh grade.

Mickey, you little scamp.
That was a long time ago.
It was hard to punish her, because we've all done whip-its, right?
All the time.
She ever tell you about the time she got out of the car in the middle of the night?
Uh, I don't think so, but you don't have to... tell me.
So, I'm driving her home, right?
It's late.

No, I was 11.
Either way, she will not stop complaining.
I don't even remember what she was talking about, but she is bitching and moaning and I finally just say,
"Hey, if you don't behave, I'm pulling over."
- Classic dad move.

That's not exactly how I remember it, but...
I am talking middle of the night, Jersey City.
Homeless people, drunks.
God knows what kind of dangerous people wandering around.
I'm yelling at her, "Hey, get back in here!"
Of course, she doesn't listen.
So I spent the rest of the night looking for her, thinking she'd been kidnapped or God knows what.
And then I find her... at a Burger King, eating french fries and having a ball.
Wow, that's a crazy story.
This one's always been a little troublemaker.
We tell her to do something, she does the opposite.
But that's what we love about her.
Lord knows she's had to put up with my shit too, so...
Mmm.

- Samosas...

That's good.
Oh, yeah!

Yeah, I think I'm going to, uh, go wash the airplane off my hands.
I'll be right back.
Fuck him.
I'm so tired of his shit.
He loves telling that stupid fucking story.
I'm sorry.

You want to know why I was so upset that night?
It's because I missed my best friend's birthday party, because I spent the whole day sitting in the lobby of his office while he pitched some shady business deal.
When he stopped the car, he was yelling at me, so when he told me to get out, I thought he was serious, because I was 11 years old!
So I got out and then he just drove away.
Oh, and he'll tell you that it was, you know, just around the block.
But he fucking left me there.
And I was just sitting there, by myself, on the corner, in the dark, for what felt like forever.
So I just walked to a Burger King and sat in the corner and cried.
And I have never been so scared in my life.
Mickey, that's awful.
Yep.
Look, I don't know if this will make you feel better, but, you know, lot of times, when we're kids, we feel things, like, a little more severely than what's real.
Are you taking his side?
No, no.

It's like that thing they say, "It's corny, but it's true."
It's like our parents know which buttons to push, because they're the ones who installed them.
Dude, you don't have to fix everything.
Okay?

I just...

Forget it.
All righty, let me at this food!
Mmm.
Mmm.
A little bland.
Well, that was excellent.
- Yes.

Oh, nah.

- Thanks, Dad.

Yeah, well, I've had better vindaloo, but I liked it okay.
Do you wanna come back to my place?
Get settled in?
Didn't you get my text?
- I don't think so.

Oh, maybe it didn't go through.
No, uh, my plans changed.
I'm on the 8:00 p.m. to San Francisco tonight.
I figured I'd get up there early, get a good night's sleep before the big meeting.
Oh, okay.
I mean, don't you want to just come see where I live?
It's the first nice place I've ever lived in.
Oh, sweetheart, I came to see you, not your place.
Do you really want to spend three hours in a car, driving across town?
I'd rather just, you know, find some place.
We could sit and talk.

Okay, yeah.

All right, where to now?
Yeah, uh, what do you think, Mickey?
Hey, let's get a drink, huh?

- Hmm.

Us.

All good things, huh?

Yeah, um, maybe we could go to that, uh, donut place that's around here?
It's pretty awesome.
They got all these crazy flavors, like marshmallow and basil, but... it's not gross like I'm making it sound.
I don't want a donut.

Right, right, right.

What about a museum?
There's an exhibit around here that's about medieval torture devices.
- Could be really fun, I think?

- Over here.

Hello.
Uh, you guys grab a table.

- Okay.

- What's your name?

- Carol, huh?

- Ah...

- Marty Dobbs, how are you?

I hate this.

What...

Yeah.

You, um...

No.

I don't know!
Well, here's to you, Jersey girl!
I don't wanna watch him drink during the day.

You think so?
He got a DUI when I was in high school and had his license suspended.
He had to go to court-mandated AA.
You know what, let's get out of here.

No, let's just stay.

Whatever you need, I'm here for you, okay?
Seriously.
Can you believe this?
You see that lady over there?

She grew up two towns away from me and here we are, meeting in a bar in LA.
What are the chances of that?
- Serendipity.

Gussy, grab your glass!
Mickle the pickle.
And one for the pops.
Here's to my beautiful daughter and to Gus.
Love you, Mick.
Hey, come on, it's bad luck not to cheers.

Hey!

I don't really feel like a beer, so I'm gonna go smoke.
I could never figure out that kid's moods.
God bless you, if you can.
Uh, I just try to listen.
You should ask her how she's doing.
I think, uh, it might turn things around a bit.
I don't get it.

Won't even have a beer with her dad.
Hmm, well, I wouldn't take it too personally.
I think she's, um...

What?
Well... she's sober.
Sober?
Yeah, like, um, you know, in the... in the program.
- AA, huh?

Again.
Well, good luck with that, Micks.
I think it's really good for her.
- Sweetheart, can I bum a smoke?

- Best happy hour in the city, this place.

Three-dollar well drinks.
Only problem is it doesn't start for two more hours.
Carol got here too early.
- I'm Carol.

You got yourself a good daddy.
Oh, yeah, he's a real great guy.
He sure is.

Lucky girl.
Carol, your, uh, nipple's out.
Oh, whoopsies!
Whoops.
Hey, you know, Gus, I think I saw a jukebox over there.
Why don't you go pick us out some tunes, huh?
Oh, I don't want to waste your money, Marty.
Who knows how long it'll take to play the song?
I'm not nervous.

Uh... okay.
Cool.

So, Mick?
Gus told me something interesting.
Oh, what's that?
He says you're in AA.
He told you that?
Why would you do that to yourself again?
Because I have a problem.
AA is just a load of bullshit.
You know how I feel about this.
That is for people that cannot think for themselves.
AA was started by a bunch of evangelicals who were fuck-ups.
But they want to make us feel like we got the problem.
I don't have a problem.
You don't have a problem.
They just want to make you think you do.
I am an alcoholic, Dad.
I need help.

Hmm.

You go to the meetings and you complain about your dad?
Is that it, huh?

Jesus, Mickey.
I raised you to use your brain.

Hey, Marty, I just want to say... you have an amazing daughter.
And you should be so proud of her.
Mmm.

That means a lot, coming from a guy
I hadn't even heard about until an hour ago.
Okay.

Gus, just stay out of it, okay?

AA.
Oh, my God.
Fuck.
So tell me about your app, Dad.
Well... it's called the R Car.
It's a high-end car service that comes and picks you up.
So, it's exactly like Uber?
No.

That's what the R stands for.

Well, there are Ubers around all the time, so you don't need to reserve them.
What about after a sporting event?

I've never had to wait for more than four minutes for an Uber.
We also have great cars.
They got bottles of water and mints and iPhone jacks.
You can charge your phone, play your music.
Yeah, Uber's got all of that.
And... and you can pick the kind of car you want to get.
Oh, that's cool.

Well, maybe not a Ferrari.

So it's exactly like Uber.
Uh, you know what, I...
- I should probably get going.

I gotta get back to the airport, get checked in.
I might as well get there early.

Ah, but your flight's not for another few hours.
Oh, no, no, no.

- No, I'm fine.

That's a good one.
Yeah.

How's Uncle Tim?
Still a fuck-up.
Here we go.

Marty, let me give you these.
- All right.

Good luck up there!
- Thanks.

All right.

Love you.
I love you, too.
All right.
Why would you tell my dad that I'm sober?
Do you know how fucked up that is, to break somebody's anonymity?
- To their dad?

I didn't want your help.

I just wanted you to be a buffer between us.
That's what I thought I was doing.
I wanted him to see I was grown up and I had my shit together and maybe, maybe he would just treat me differently.
And we could have a decent day for once.

It's always gonna be the same.
You don't know that.
Things change.

I almost got through one day with him without a fight.
But then you had to go and fucking tell him about AA and he got all pissed off.
That is so fucked up, Gus!
I can't even be in a car with you right now.
Oh, my God...

Jesus Christ.
Fuck.
Mickey, wait!
Come on!

Oh, God.
Just...
Do you really fucking need people to like you that badly?
I'm the one who should matter to you.

"Oh, Marty, you're so funny."
You should have stood up for me.
I tried, but you told me to, like...
- Oh, Jesus.

You want me... your dad to like me.
Am I supposed to have him hate me?

Shut the fuck up!
I'm sorry.

I know I messed up, and...
I'm truly sorry.
I'm sorry too.
I'm...
It's really not you.

He was shitty to you.

I'll give you a ride home so you can get a break from me.
I don't want a break from you.
Okay?
Oh, oh, oh!

Fuck you!
Yeah.
