(phone vibrates)
Oh, shh.
(phone vibrates)
Come on.
(phone continues vibrating)
(groans)
(groaning):

They want to do what?
Tell-tell, um, tell POTUS I'm...
- (papers scatter)

I'll be right there, okay?
And, um, get, uh, Captain Baker.
Call Captain Baker.

Is it about the smuggling ring?
(sighs) CIA found another cargo flight carrying contraband.
That's a good thing, isn't it?
Not if they force it down.
BECKER:

Refueled in Spain and made an unscheduled stop in Cairo.
Just like the flights to Somalia.
It seems your smuggling ring is still active.
Okay, first of all, it's not my smuggling ring.
And second, why do we have armed fighters in the sky?
It was supposed to be a passive operation.
- Not anymore.

Bess, the situation has evolved.

HAYMOND:

And he sent us this.
More than a dozen shoulder-launched, surface-to-air missiles.
Each with enough firepower to bring down a jetliner.
I've ordered a squadron of F-35s out of Incirlik to intercept.
Contact in just under two minutes, Mr. President.
- It's a mistake.

HAYMOND:

What if they refuse?
Current flight plan has them over the empty quarter of Saudi Arabia.
Collateral damage would be minimal.
Not for the investigation.
The mole will know that we're onto the smuggling ring.
He'll go to ground, we'll never catch him.
Contact in one minute.
Captain Baker, tell the president your plan.
I built an authentication bot that self-generates
- a capture log.

Um, yes, we placed a trap door in the State Department's computer system, so if anyone tampers with the manifest, we'll know.
Did your agent place a tracking device on those missiles?
Of course, but that-that doesn't...
Well then, we'll hardly lose 'em if it lands.
We have assets in Delhi who can recover the Stingers.
But the mole is the only one who can tell us who murdered Agent Garcia.
Sir,
I strongly advise you to call off this intercept.
HAYMOND:

Need a decision, Mr. President.
Tell our pilots to bug out.
Bravo 6, Bravo 7, disengage.

RTB, ASAP.
I want hourly reports on those Stingers until we get a result.
Yes, Mr. President.
And if those missiles are in danger, I'm shutting it down.
Morning, gang.
- ALISON:

Crisis averted?
Or started, maybe.
What, no more eggs?
Sorry, Growing Boy strikes again.
- Jace?

Well, I blame the McCords.
Speaking of, Maureen sent you something.
Oh, she's been cleaning out Dad's place.
Apparently, he left this for me in the attic.
(laughs) Unbelievable.
ELIZABETH:

HENRY:

Visible V8 engine.
It was my Christmas present in, like, seventh grade.
Never could get this thing to work.
Really?

Oh, yeah.

He threw out all my trophies and comics, leaves me this.
You ready, dorkus?
- (scoffs)

Uh, and foster a legacy of intergenerational cruelty?
I think I'll pass.
Don't bother asking me, Dad, because why would a girl be interested?
Alison, I didn't think...
That's the point.
And I'm not, but maybe I would have been.
Bye.
ELIZABETH:

- ALISON:

Well played, Super Dad.
(chuckles)
You really thought
Jace was gonna want...
Well, it's just been such a long time
- since we've done anything...

Oh, I got to go in.
Well, if you're looking for a shared activity,
I have DVR'ed tons of Cupcake Wars.
Oh, boy.
There is no food in this house.
MO:

HENRY:

No idea.

The camera broke again?
Went off the air two hours ago.
Techs just gave up
- on getting it back.

Well, was there anything new?
Learned a lot about digging latrines.

Team of VFF guys installing new defensive weaponry on their perimeter.

M18 Claymores couple of M40s.
They're anticipating a raid.
Which means whatever kind of attack they're planning, is imminent.
Okay.

- Good morning, ma'am.

- Did you watch last night?

- All right...

Okay, you have to let me tell you just, like...
- No.

Just... two words.
Okay.

Frosting.
- Get out.

Oh, great.

ELIZABETH:

- Good morning.

Okay, I want a name.
Who took the last donut?
It was me, ma'am.
A noble gesture, Nadine.
But I didn't spend the last 20 years in the CIA profiling dissemblers and liars for nothing.
Got anything to say, Matt?
Is that a new jacket?
It was a cruller, wasn't it?
(laughs)
It was a bear claw, ma'am.
NADINE:

I have an urgent request from President Kaimbi of Namibia.
Poaching of the endangered south-western black rhino has spiked recently in Etosha National Park.
DAISY: "Spiked" is putting it mildly.
In 1960, there were over 100,000 in the wild.
- Today, there are fewer than 2,000.

- more a killing field.

NADINE:

Which is why Namibia needs helicopters to fight the poachers.
You know, I could check with DoD.
They might have something in surplus.
Yeah, do it, but is it strange that I'm having a feeling of déjà vu?
MATT:

- Kaimbi asked for night vision goggles.

Yeah, and body armor the year before that.
ELIZABETH:

We need to shift the paradigm.
I want bold, comprehensive ideas that are going to end this poaching once and for all.
I'll get the Africa desk on it right away.
No.

- Department wide?

Call the NFL if you have to.
I don't care where the good idea comes from, I just want one.
Will you call President Kaimbi for me?
- Yes, ma'am.

- will somebody feed me?

(insects trilling)
(engine turns off)
Your camera broke.
Well, I guess I'm not a very good cyborg.
You got the stuff?
Thanks.

Look, I need a report.
What's the word on the bomb?
They're getting ready to use it.
- What?

I should get more details at the Council of Elders meeting next week.
Here, I got something for you.
What's this?
That's from the drone.
The serial number was filed off, but that model... had an ISS upgrade back in '08.
I got the SKU number from the housing for the thermographic camera.
Nice work.
Could you have been made?
Nah, man.
No.
They got me guarding it. (chuckles)
You believe that?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Hey, do you, uh do you believe in visions, Professor?
Do you mean, like, in the biblical sense?
Like when Paul said he knew a man who was caught in the third heaven.
I mean, is that a... a metaphor or was it real?
Well, most of things referred to as visions in the Bible are just dreams, really.
Did this come up in the Council?
No, no.
It was... there was this kid in Iraq.
He used to hang around outside our FOB selling knockoff DVDs.
Aasif.
Okay.

I thought I saw him the other day.
Were you were awake?
Where?
I was out in the woods.
It was dark.
Yeah, I know, it's crazy.
Have you been sick?

I can bring a medic.
No.
Yeah, yeah, that must be it.

Look, man, I-I got to go.
I'll have the Intel, the location of the bomb, soon as I can, okay?
If anything like this happens again,
I want to know immediately.
You got me?
You bet.
Ma'am?
ELIZABETH:

More proposals on stopping rhino poaching.
"Tougher screening at airports, adjusting the penal code..."
We've tried all...
"Call in the Green Berets"?
- It worked in Operation Dumbo Drop.

Secure the doors!

ELIZABETH:

Security situation, ma'am.
(phone ringing)
- Bluebird is secure.

Captain Baker.
What is it, Captain?
We got him.
We found the mole.
It's happening.
(quiet, indistinct chatter)
Barry Milken, freeze!

Show us your hands!
TEAM LEADER:

KEITH:

Verification and Compliance.
23-year vet of the Foreign Service, trained as a forensic accountant, holds a TS/SCI clearance.
AGENT:

- Has he asked for a lawyer?

BARRY:

Violation of the Arms Export Control Act.
Destruction of federal documents.
Material support for terrorism.
Material support?

It's a bluff.

Nothing directly connects him to an arms ring.
I don't understand.

You're falsifying government records.
You were covering up for your boss.
- Who is he?

We hear you love mint chip.
I don't understand.
I need to get in there.
Yeah.

AGENT: ...the moment that you start naming names.
No, you can't.
It's a brazen violation of procedure.
Yeah.

He's probably still in shock, which means he's vulnerable to an authority figure.
I have two authority figures in there with him right now.
I'm fourth in line for the presidency, and his boss.
With the right approach, I can get him talking.
Look, you just tell us the names we want to know, and you get to go home.
It is what I did at the CIA, and it's the best play and you know it.
I didn't do anything wrong.
- Are you sure?

Step out of the room.
AGENT:

(sighs)
Three of us are gonna get some coffee.
That'll take about five minutes.
Will you get me a coffee, light?

Hey, Barry.
Elizabeth.
Please.
I-I'm sorry we never met.
Madam Secretary, this is all a terrible mistake.
I read your jacket on the way over here, and I thought your name seemed familiar.
It's on a plaque, isn't it?
Where were you stationed?
Kenya, 1998.
That's right.
The embassy bombing.
Yeah.
You helped evacuate the injured.
I-I was doing my job.
Is that what it was?
'Cause a guy who carries a pregnant FSO three miles to the hospital isn't just punching a clock.
He's a patriot.
I don't know what you've gotten yourself mixed up with, Barry.
But I know that you... you didn't intend to harm the United States.
And you certainly never thought anybody was gonna die.
But your silence is only helping the people who want to harm us.
You go back to '98 and ask yourself is this the guy you wanted to be?
I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
Madam Secretary.
Step away from my client.
HENRY:

Well, to be fair, he's also defended celebrity killers.
Well, at least they found the Stingers.
But if Milken won't talk, then we'll never find out who killed Agent Garcia.
That why you're stress eating?
No.

What about you?

You mean my obsessive tinkering with this thing as a way to avoid losing my mind with worry over my asset?
That bad, huh?
And of course, it makes me think of my dad, and how every time we talked, we would fight.
Unless we were fixing something, then somehow, we'd get along.
Y-You see, this...

I can't even figure out which decade to stress out about.
Why would Fox represent Milken?
I don't know, because he's a fame-seeking blowhard?
Well, yeah, sure, but... seems strange that he would wade into a national security case.
He never has in the past.
Why now?
Well, he's certainly not doing it for the money.
Milken doesn't exactly have deep pockets.
Maybe there's a man behind the curtain who does.
NADINE:

Well, if anyone can tell us who hired Jim Fox to represent Milken, it's Mike.
Well, um, if I may, ma'am, why don't you call him yourself?
Because, frankly, he'd rather hear from you.
He asks about you, you know.
Does he?
Constantly.
Good morning, everybody, oh...
- DAISY:

Quick rhino update.
So we've officially requested half a dozen OH-58 Kiowas...
Great.
...for Namibia under the Defense Articles Program.
ELIZABETH:

MATT:

Who's the, uh, new kid?
This is Gwen White, from the Office of Health Diplomacy.
- ELIZABETH:

Hi, uh, thank you for having me.
Well, I assume there's a good reason for having you?
- I hope so.

Ms. White has a rather unorthodox idea about how we can address the rhino poaching crisis.
Right, but I don't want to waste anyone's time, so...
Mm!

(taps key)
Okay.

(tapping keys)
In the case of rhino horn, the market is mostly concentrated here.
In Vietnam.
(taps key)
Oh, your thing...

Sorry.

Fine.

Because traditional folklore holds that the black rhino horn has a wide range of curative properties, including troubles with impotence.
Which it doesn't, I assume.
The horn is just keratin, so, you know, it's about as effective as chewing on your fingernails.
Meanwhile, we have actual pharmaceuticals that work.
PDE inhibitors, like Viagra.
So if we can educate the Vietnamese people about these alternatives... we can reduce the demand for rhino horn.
GWEN:

So basically, you're talking
- about a public health campaign.

Ideally, coupled with a drug distribution program.
MATT:

GWEN:

Admittedly, it's a small step, and it seems farfetched, but...
I think it's brilliant.
- GWEN:

I actually had the idea a couple of years ago, but given the subject matter, I was, uh, a little reluctant.
I-I want you to pitch this to Ambassador Dang.
Blake is gonna help you
- with the PowerPoint.

And I'll get a celebrity spokesperson.
And I'll tackle Big Pharma.
I'll write the copy.
Let's go, people.

MATT:

Hey.
What's up?
DoD is still trying to track down that SKU number that Ian gave us.
They're looking at military depots.
Cool.

About that...
That's the drink I gave Ian last night.
I want his saliva tested.
What for?
Drugs.
Psychotropics, to be specific.
He seemed disoriented.
Slow responses, jittery.
Well, that could be a number of things.
A lot of religious cults give drugs to their adherents.
It makes neophytes more compliant, more receptive to doctrine.
But in this case, I think it's a privilege reserved for the inner circle.
A way of giving them a spiritual edge on the other followers.
The Council of Elders.
Timing works.
But no outbursts?
Screaming, hearing voices.

Not that he mentioned, but he did say...
The guy is a marine.

I know all about the Marines, Mo.
The point is, this is not a guy who cracks.
Is he a guy who hallucinates?
Because he told me he saw a kid that he knew in Iraq.
(quietly):

Okay.
Say we send it in, and it comes back positive.
They're gonna order us to pull him.
With good reason.
Are you really gonna take that chance when we're this close to the finish?
(exhales)
ALISON:

- Did you see that...

- Aw.

How were the cupcakes tonight?
"Cakey." So said the guest judge, the guy who played Gunther on Friends.
How's your engine?
I feel like Han Solo trying to start the Millennium Falcon.
Yeah, try watching grown women fight over sprinkles.
- Oh, shut up.

Oh, wait.

There is an entire thread for tips on this thing.
(phone ringing)
Thanks, Jace.
ALISON:

Jim Fox is here?
Madam Secretary.
Who hired you to represent my employee?
They told me you were direct.
Oh, well, unlike you,
I don't get paid by the hour.
Whereas venal and malicious bureaucrats can take their time.
Who sent you?
Lady Justice, as far as you're concerned.
And I know that your little attack dog, Mike Barnow, has been sniffing around, trying to get dirt on me.
Not dirt, just an understanding of your involvement in the Milken case.
Sure, sure.
Speaking of which, the attorney general will want your opinion on it.
Tell him to make the deal.
You're asking for immunity?
- Iron-clad and unqualified.

The alternative is a lengthy trial, which won't go well for you.
Is that a threat?
A mole inside the State Department right under your nose?
You give me a platform, and I'll savage you
- like a lion ripping apart...

Do you know the difference between
- you and me?

Is that you have something greater to protect.
Me, I'm fine with burning it down.
You need me more than I need you.
Mr. Attorney General, it kills me to say this, but I think Jim Fox is right.
What, make the deal?
You're really gonna let him bully you?
No, I could care less about his bullying.
Him dragging this out is what concerns me.
A trial could go how long?
Ten months, maybe a year.
That we're in the dark.
It's really a question of scope.
Mr. Milken committed a serious crime.
Only vital, actionable intelligence can justify an immunity deal.
Which we have no guarantee we'd get.
We could be letting a murderer walk free.
According to the FBI's timeline,
Barry Milken was nowhere near Agent Garcia's house
- during the poisoning window.

He doesn't exactly fit the profile of a criminal mastermind.
I have a source who spoke with my chief of staff this morning.
Jim Fox was paid to take this case... mid-six figures
- just for the retainer.

The point is there's a bigger fish out there, and Barry Milken is the guy who can tell us how to find him.
I'll let you know my decision.
BLAKE:

Which is why we're proposing a targeted ad campaign, fully funded by the State Department.
DAISY:

- (imitating Fonzie):

Really?
- Will he come to Vietnam?

The entire campaign will be produced and shot by your local media companies, providing a boost to your entertainment industry.
MATT:

Linh Ky, who just happens to be the prime minister's wife, we think this campaign will make a sizeable impact.
So to speak.
DAISY:

Let's talk about your end of the partnership.
The Fonz.
You struck out?
- Seriously?

Ambassador Dang refused the ad campaign, unless we can subsidize the ED drugs.
And Big Pharma won't cut their rates to an emerging market.
I did paint slash effects and morph transitions.
I really thought The Fonz would clinch it.
BLAKE:

Well, apparently Happy Days can't beat cold, hard cash.
- So to speak. (chuckles)

We can barely afford to run the ad campaign.
I hate to pile on, but we just got a communiqué from the World Wildlife Fund.
Another 16 black rhinos were slaughtered in Etosha last night.
That's almost 1% of the population.
Forget a year, we're talking population collapse the next three to six months.
ELIZABETH:

They did, but it's gonna take another three to four months to deliver them.
Months?
They know they can fly, right?
Apparently, there's a lot of steps involved.
How many steps can there be?
Seven departments, three agencies, and more than a dozen deputies at the Office of General Counsel.
Wow, that's... thorough.
I'm sorry, Madam Secretary, but here at Defense we have to make sure our equipment doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
But this is a transfer of non-lethal surplus equipment on humanitarian grounds.
Those choppers can still be armed.
And last time I checked, rhinos weren't people.
The syndicate behind the slaughter in Namibia, it's destabilizing regimes throughout the continent, spreading terrorism in its wake.
Trust me, plenty of people are suffering because of this.
My hands are tied.
These are laws enacted by Congress.
And personally, I'd prefer not to get hauled in front of a Senate hearing.
(sighs)
More cupcake carnage?
I don't even know why I'm still watching.
Those grandmas are nothing more than a bunch of back-stabbing harpies.
Bad day?
What, I can't dis the elderly when I'm happy?
You can dis, you can dis.
The south-western black rhino is going extinct, and I can't even get the Pentagon to send a few lousy choppers to stop the massacre.
Hmm.

You ever tattle in school?
Uh, probably.

I did.
Mikey Finn, first grade.
I told Mrs. Shaheen that he was stealing answers from me for the spelling test, and she told me to cover my paper and mind my own business.
You want to involve Dalton.
He could sign a presidential waiver, and the helicopters would be there tomorrow.
Which would be going outside the chain of command.
And we can't run a government by presidential fiat.
If you can effect real change by going to teacher,
I say go for it.
Thank you.
You know, sometimes doing the right thing... sucks.
Really.
(phone vibrates)
(groans) The attorney general made a deal.
Barry Milken is being released on bail tomorrow morning.
He can be talking by noon.
Now, you see that?
You wait around long enough, something good is bound to happen.
Come on, cupcakes.
- Is that...

- Ah.

Ugh.
- She's eating it.

- Daisy.

- Hey.

Yeah, I was thinking that must be upsetting.
It's really not.
If Milken can tell the FBI who killed the man I knew as Kevin, then that's a good thing.
If he ever stops posing for the camera.
What do you mean?
Jim Fox is holding a press conference with Milken
- outside of the Justice Department.

Can you turn it up?
Well, I'm just glad that the attorney general's taken a break, finally, from wasting tax-payer money, because he had no chance, zero, of getting a conviction.
REPORTER:

Of course not, because when has the FBI ever acted unethically?
My client got full immunity.

Mr. Milken, how does it feel to be free?
He's thrilled, and can't wait to share whatever he can with the authorities.
Which is what he wanted in the first place.
Thanks, guys.

REPORTER:

No more questions.

NEWSCASTER:

Barry Milken, who was detained on several classified... (gunshots, people screaming)
Shots... uh, shots have been fired.
It appears that... it appears that Mr. Milken has been shot.
Barry Milken has been shot.
Ian tested positive for dimethyltryptamine.
- What?

Where did you get this?
I took it to a private lab.
- You went behind my back?

And how confident are you that this test is accurate?
Well, they used LCMS, and they did it twice, so very.
It's likely been in small doses so far, probably mixed in with his food, but the effect is cumulative.
Ian's symptoms could be about to get much worse.
Okay, so he had a bad episode here and there.
No.

Because under interrogation, it leaves some people vulnerable.
Ian's cover could be blown.
We staged a car accident with a dead body to get him to where he is now...
And there's a high-capacity bomb that could kill hundreds and hundreds and hundreds that we haven't located.
I'm with you, Mo.

I would have done anything to keep this mission in play.
But we can't leave a compromised asset in the lion's den.
You're pulling Ian.
Tomorrow night at the meet.
If you don't like it, take it up with the director.
Hey, what's this?
I found your multimeter in the basement.
I hope that's okay.
What?
I just don't remember even teaching you
- how to use a multimeter.

I mean, I was just wondering...

Because, like, I know this is hard, and you're old and incompetent, but just check this out, hold on.
(beeps)
I'll be damned.

Yeah, so the circuit can't close.
You're welcome.
We need a replacement part.
You do.

Hey, come on, you're part of the team now.
Don't you want to help me fix it?
Uh, no.

Dashiell invited me.
Okay, all right, well, I guess you earned it.
Awesome.
Oh, uh, do you want me to put that back in the dining room?
No, it's fine.
Good night, Jace.
Good night, old man.
The sniper was positioned in a vacant apartment, approximately 300 yards from the target.
We believe he escaped through the Navy Memorial Metro Station before a perimeter could be established.
Well, what about CCTV?
Well, they're reviewing footage now, sir, but most of the cameras were disabled beforehand.
Then this'll be a short press conference.
LUCY:

Thanks, Lucy.
Did Milken say anything before he was killed?
No, sir.

Where does that leave us?
I'm afraid back to square one.
Well, keep me apprised of any developments.
I want this to remain a priority.
Yes, sir.
- Mr. President.

Bess.
Well, I know the timing isn't great, but I need to talk to you about the south-western black rhinoceros.
You went over my head!
Shattering decades of protocol, all for some dumb mammals my grandkids can see at the zoo!
Well, that'll be the only place they can see them
- at the rate we're going.

Waiver, technically, and it was an emergency.
It's your pet rock, I get it, but you don't just throw it through my office window.
Do you have any idea who you're messing with?
How many of your department's projects I can kill with the stroke of a pen?
- Thousands, probably.

Our government only works when we operate in tandem.
- You're right.

Gordon, I'm agreeing with you.
Pulling rank to save an endangered species is not sustainable... ironic as that may seem.
That's why I have a proposal to ensure that it never happens again, but for that I need your help.
(engine shuts off)
♪ ♪
(gunshots)
(gunfire continues)
(breathing unsteadily)
Henry, oh, my God.
Hey, babe.

Hey.
- Hey, tell me you're okay?

The ankle's a through and through and this other one is just a ricochet.
That fractured your knee.
Well, it was a clean break.

- Well, you better be.

Henry, when are you gonna get a desk job that involves a real desk?
Well, they offered me a cubicle, but I was gonna hold out for something with a window.
You think this is funny?
Henry, you got shot.
Babe, it's fine.
What am I gonna tell the kids?
Tell them I got in a car accident.
No, I don't mean the cover story.
I mean if you get killed.
I'll have to explain to them that their dad thought it was a good idea to throw himself in harm's way.
I didn't throw myself anywhere.
We had no reason to believe this meet was compromised.
That's a minor technicality if the bullet had landed in your head.
Okay.
I was asked to manage an asset to help stop another domestic terror attack.
I can't do that from behind a desk. (groans)
If you think I should quit, then just say it.
I think you should quit.
With my asset in danger?
- With VFF on the verge of a major attack?

- The threat is contained.

We got a SKU number off the thermographic camera.
It goes back to a military depot in Texas, so God knows how much more military hardware they have.
Why not use the serial numbers?
- What?

Every piece of military equipment has a unique serial number.
Yeah, the number was filed off, but it was a retrofit back in '08...
The weapons that we're looking for, they fit that pattern.
All the serial numbers are filed off.
Every time we tried to trace them back, it was a dead end.
In that depot, what else is in that depot?
Humvees, tanks, heavy munitions.
Stinger missiles?
Depleted uranium?
We're looking for the same supplier.
DALTON:

He-He's recovering, sir.
He tried to drag himself here from the hospital.
Of course he did.

It was traced to a depot in Corpus Christi, Texas, sir.
BECKER:

Stinger missiles.
ELIZABETH:

Ground zero for the smuggling ring and the whole conspiracy.
MO:

And selling to the highest bidder.
Do we know what else is missing?
- No, sir, and that's what scares me.

Question everyone who works there.
I want every bullet and ball bearing accounted for.
Already into it, sir.
Bureau's on alert, Mr. President.
CIA has every analyst with a pulse working overtime.
And tell DHS to put out a National Terrorism Bulletin.
I want every county, city, and town across the country prepared in case of attack.
BECKER:

Mr. Secretary, you get my proposal?
About the rhino program?
Yeah, but kind of busy with a renegade depot right now.
You liked it, didn't you?
(sighs)
It was a good PowerPoint.
All right, but we're gonna need tangible results if it's gonna continue.
I owe you one.
Yes, you do, Madam Secretary.
JIM:

Your hobby's an open secret.
It's competition in its purest form.
The weak get shunted aside.
Relaxes me.
I have nothing to say to you or the FBI.
No, no, no, you misunderstand.
I'm here to offer my sympathy.
I know what it's like watching someone die in front of you, thinking, on some level, it's all your fault.
Excuse me?

You were hired for the single purpose of getting Barry Milken out of custody so your employer could have him killed.
Saying I got played?
Like a cheap kazoo.
And instead of fighting back, you're sitting here feeding the pigeons.
I'm not afraid of anybody.
Tell it to the birds.
Or better yet, tell me who hired you.
Uh, you wanted to see me, ma'am?
Yeah.
I wanted to tell you in person that your proposal is officially a go.
What?

The secretary of defense found money in his global contingency fund.
Ambassador Dang just okayed the pilot program.
Oh, ma'am, this is... oh, wow.
Next time, Gwen, don't wait for an invitation.
You sat on this proposal for how long?
Two years.
A good idea is meaningless without the courage to act.
You must speak up.
Yes, ma'am.
Um, will that be all?
N-No.
- Oh.

But that means...
You're getting promoted.
(laughs)
Yeah.
(laughing)
(crying):

It was a very good idea.
(quietly):

(laughs, sobs)
ELIZABETH:

What's that smell?
JASON:

You know, I actually think Dad's car accident knocked some sense into him.
- Oh, yeah?

Mother, behold, the Renwal Visible V-8 Engine.
- (gears whirring)

- (laughs)

- ELIZABETH:

You can see every detail of the cycle right there.
- See that?

You can see the firing pattern of the pistons.
Now, is that smoke part of the marvel?
- I think that's just dust.

That smells like smoke and battery acid.
Jace, maybe turn it off.
No, okay, you do realize this took Dad more than 40 years to get working?
With your help, pal.
All the more reason not to let it go up in flames and take the house with it.
- Get it out of here, please.

- Okay.

Might be a cracked seal or something.
"Cracked seal."
Wow, bonding accomplished.
What happened?
- I don't know.

Sympathy for the crash victim?
Cupcake Wars fatigue?
Maybe it's the ghost of my old man working his magic.
- My money's on your dad.

Do you think that they're actually buying the car-accident cover story?
Maybe.
Maybe they're just too scared to consider the alternative.
Any news about Ian?
No sign of him.
There's an FBI surveillance team out there looking for him.
Either he set me up or he's dead, so...
(quietly):

(phone rings)
Yeah?
Okay, send him in.
Madam Secretary.
We have a mutual enemy.
I want to work with you to destroy him.
