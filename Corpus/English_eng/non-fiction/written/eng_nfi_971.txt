Okay!
- Got you some snacks and sandwiches.

Got a bottle of champagne for Abby from me and a six-pack for tailgating.
What, no beer for the road?
I'm kidding.
I'll grab some from the liquor store on the way out of town.
You know there's a snowstorm coming.
Oh, don't worry, I'm gonna drive real fast.
Did I just invent NASCAR in the snow?
Where you heading?
Oh, taking Abby on a little surprise trip for her birthday.
Don't you wanna know what the surprise is?
Honestly, I regret asking the first question.
She's like maple bacon.

- Hey, Ma!

Hey, can I get a couple beers?
- Sure, sweetie.

Oh, relax, they're expired anyway.
How'd it go at work?

Yeah, it went fine.
I'm happy I could help.
You don't have to thank me.

You just do with that information what you will.
- Fuck you, Clint!

Don't tell me to calm down!
Oh, shit, we got a Walmart breakup.
What are you talking about?
Oh, it's a drinking game for when white trash couples fight in public.
One drink if she cusses, two if she slaps him.
And you gotta chug your whole beer if she throws a drink in his face.
I'm so glad you guys are finding new and creative ways to drink.
We're innovators, Ma.
You're bullshit.
All right, I gotta go.
What?

Sorry, dude, booty call.

I'm done with this!

Oh, shit, she gonna throw the drink.
No, Hank, the game is you only chug if she throws a drink in his face.
What game?
- Whoa!

I was hoping we could meet inside so I could grab a beer.
- Way ahead of you, amigo.

Look, I appreciate you meeting me.
- I assume you heard I got fired, yeah?

Look, Ed...

Any way you can call Neumann's Hill and try and get me my job back?
Look, man, I'll do anything, okay?
I'll even go to that meeting, you know, with the... with the...

The sexual harassment seminar?
Yeah, man, that one!
Rooster, I'd love to help you, but I can't.
But you're the one who hired me there.
I mean, they're obviously gonna listen to you.
Rooster, you tried to expense a night at a strip club.
That was a team-building exercise!
Rooster, you know I think the world of you, but there's nothing I can do.
All right, I understand.
You'll land on your feet.
- Yes, I will.

I'm gonna need these.
- Hey, Beau.

Good.

Well, I'm on my way back from the airport and I thought I'd bring back your binoculars 'cause I know they're like a third son to you.
Third?
If the house was on fire, this is the son I'd carry out.
- How was your Disney cruise?

They have a waterslide and five pools.
And every night, they seat you at a different table so you get to meet all kinds of new people.
And your reward at the end of this rainbow of fun is being dropped off in Mexico?
And... brought you a little gift.
Mickey Mouse ears with "Grumpy" on it!
Grumpy?

I tried to get them to make me one for Colt, but they wouldn't put "Shithead" on it.
Hey, the storm's settling in.
You're welcome to come in for a drink till it lets up.
If I come in, I'm gonna talk to you.
That's fine.
I'm all ears.
Is it much further?

Yeah, we'll be fine.
We have four-wheel drive, tire chains... one of our seat belts works.
Well, I packed a bag so hopefully, we're staying at a hotel somewhere.
I didn't say it was a hotel.
Well, it fucking better be!
Well, it fucking better is!
Oh, my God.
Wait, is it that new hotel and spa in Aspen?
Linda wanted to have her wedding there but she couldn't afford it.
Suck it, Linda!
No, it's not that.
I was gonna wait till we got there, but here, grab the wheel.
Colt, what the hell?
Ah, ta-da!
Champagne!
Yeah, it's your birthday and I know how much you love champagne.
"Dear Abby, don't let Colt tell you this is from him.
Happy birthday.

Probably should have read that first, huh?
That's not the important part.
- Open the envelope.

Are you kidding me?
- Garth fucking Brooks?

Oh, my God, I love you so much!
- All right, whoa!

That's a little too much love.
This is the best birthday gift ever.
- Thank you.

You've put up with a lot lately so I wanted to do something special for you.
I called in a little favor and got a couple tickets.
Oh, uh, if anybody asks, you've got two weeks to live.
- Hey.

Must be two feet of snow out there already.
Had to tie my bra to the antenna so I could find my car in the morning.
Smart.
Oh, hold on.
I just told you I wasn't wearing a bra, you didn't ask to motorboat me?
You feeling okay?
Just a long, shit day.
Sorry.

What's going on?
- I got fired.

Is this because you were in jail?
Honey, everybody goes to jail.

Shit, I would've been fired three, four times this year already.
What happened?
Just don't want to play their stupid corporate games, you know?
Don't matter.

No, I know you will.
You wanna talk about it?
Not much to talk about.

There you go, you're up to date.
Have you told your family?
I just said I didn't want to talk about it.
Honey, I'm just trying to help you.
- Well, I don't need your help.

Unemployed guy living in his mom's hunting cabin, eating a dented can of spaghetti rings.
No, you don't need my help.

First of all, I dented that myself, okay?

Secondly, I'm doing fine.
Well, I could...

Okay.
What the fuck does that mean?
I'm not gonna work at the Cracker Barrel.
Oh, why?

Well, how do I put this?

Oh, but it's okay for me?
No.

Oh, yeah.

Go fuck yourself.
Shit!
Holy shit!
Oh, my God!

My God, this is the last thing I need.
Jesus!

Okay, guys...
I think I'm gonna have to shut it down 'cause of the storm, so this is last call.
So it's time we get you home.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
Aw, that's sweet.
He was talking to the beer.
We're closing up, so, anything else?
Uh... a club soda and lime, please.
Trying to sober up?
- For the last 15 years and four months.

- Yeah, I'm one of those.

I got two sons who are in denial about being those.
I like your dream catcher.
- What?

Wow.
I put that here the day I took over this bar.
You're the first person who's ever noticed it.
Well, most people are probably looking at the booze and I'm trying to look anywhere else.
Doesn't look like something you picked up at the ampm.
No.
My grandmother gave it to me when I was a kid.
She was quarter Chippewa.
No kidding.
- My grandfather was half Cherokee.

But all he ever gave me was a predisposition for high cholesterol.
I'm Maggie.
Clint.

You must be Maggie of the sign outside.

Ah, yeah, you should have been here the time
I lost the "tails" out of my "cocktails" sign.
- Wow, that must've been fun.

Whole new clientele that week.
Anyway, it's none of my business, but... your friend seemed pretty pissed off earlier.
Yeah.

- I'm a musician...

You think your friend is coming back?
Nope.

You never really know how much denim you wear until you see it spread out all along the side of a highway.
So, she didn't leave you, she did you a favor.
I don't blame her.

Waking up every morning in a new city.
Everyone you meet is a stranger.

I'm waiting for the bad part.
So, a musician...

Well, the Barstow Daily News once called me
"Surprisingly decent before he fell off the stage."
I'd play you something, but I think my guitar is in a snowbank somewhere on the way to Denver.
Yeah, well, how about this?

If you play me something while I'm closing up, all your soda waters are on the house.
Good, 'cause my wallet's in my ex's car.
Okay, but any tips you get, we split.
Is that a guitar?
I don't know... and I don't care.
We haven't moved in, like, an hour.
I've been staring at the same stupid billboard the whole time.
- It ain't been that long.

"Accidentes autovilisticos?
"Consulta gratis.
"Telefonear ocho-ocho-ocho, ocho-ocho-ocho, ocho-ocho-seis."
Idiots.

We'll be there soon.
Before you know it, we'll be arm-in-arm with complete strangers singing "Friends in Low Places."
Drinking our $14 Bud Lights.
And the $14 Bud Lights of the guys next to us.
"Oh, I'm sorry.

"It's all good, man.

Waze says it's gonna take six hours to get to Denver.
Waze changes all the time.
Yup.

We'll take a different route.
The traffic is backed up both ways.
We're not gonna make the concert.

What?

Well, look, there's a Duke's Smokehouse like a half a mile from here.
Johnny G. On Yelp says "I've had worse."
No.

We're going to this concert.
We're gonna buy a $40 ill-fitting T-shirt that we're never gonna wear.
We're gonna have fucking fun.
Best birthday ever.
Oh, that really helps.
I'm sorry, I love being stuck in this snowstorm in this fucking truck.
Garth Brooks!

Really?
What?
You're gonna do that in here?
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.
Maybe that huge wad of tobacco in your mouth that makes you spit every ten seconds got in the way.
You really need to spit, don't you?
Nope.
Wow.

Well, at least I ain't gotta breathe it in.
Mmm-hmm.

I'm blowin' it out the window!
Roll your window up, Colt!
- Put out your cigarette out.

You're making me miserable on my birthday.
No, you're making you miserable on your birthday.
You're giving me fucking emphysema!
Thank you.
Yeah, you're welcome.
All right, fine.

It's right there.

Waze says we'll be there in... 45 minutes.
♪ But I ain't lonely, babe ♪
♪ I ain't lonely, baby ♪
♪ I ain't lonely, babe ♪
♪ Tonight ♪
All right, I only have one question.
Why the hell aren't you famous?
Came in second on Star Search one year.
Would have come in first but...

I had my chance.
I got a record deal, went on tour with Willie Nelson.
- Wow, really?

Until Willie kicked me off for doing too many drugs.
Yeah, when Willie Nelson says "slow down," that should tell you something.
Yeah, I burned a few bridges.
And a couple of motel rooms.

Who leaves a drunk man alone in a room with a lava lamp?
I almost burned down my dorm room at college.
Actually, I fell asleep while holding a joint... but I was staring right at a lava lamp.
Weed and lava lamps, that was the Ambien of the '70s.
Anyway... now I'm perfectly happy with club soda and a life on the road.
So what's your favorite place you've been?
Well, I'd say either Paris, France, or Elko, Nevada.
Really?
Yeah, there's a little diner there that serves great enchiladas.
Elko's nice too.
Elko's actually the first place I ever got the courage to get on stage sober.
I needed to play more than I needed the booze.
I traded one addiction for another, I guess.
Yeah.

So, what's your story?
I grew up in Scottsbluff, Nebraska.
Yeah, my father worked in the sugar factory there.
He always called it "a pretty sweet job."
He wasn't funny, but he was a good dad.
And then I went to the University of Nebraska.
- What'd you major in, corn?

Well, then between my sophomore and junior year,
I decided it'd be fun to hitchhike across the country.
I wanted to visit every state.
But I only made it to one.
I met this cowboy named Beau... and I spent the best summer of my life there.
He taught me how to ranch and shoot guns.
I taught him how to dance and shoot tequila.
- You know what they say about tequila.

I can't remember.

So how'd you end up here?
Finished college... and then I married that cowboy, had a couple of boys, bought this bar... divorced that cowboy, now I'm trying to sell the bar.
Hey, you wouldn't wanna add a bar to the list of things you burned down, would you?
That's cute, you think I haven't burned down a bar.
Why don't I play you another song?

"Angel from Montgomery" by John Prine.
Well, you got good taste.
I could talk to you all night long.
You don't have a place to stay, do you?
No, I do not.
Well, if you wanna crash in the bar,
I got some spare blankets out in my Airstream.
Really?

No.

I appreciate this, Maggie.
Yeah... it's my pleasure.
You're an interesting guy, Clint.
Hey, if you hear a weird noise in the night, it's either a raccoon trying to get in the Dumpster or Hank trying to get back in the bar.
Either way, just shine a light in their eyes, they'll run off.
So, it's day two of my cruise and my granddaughter has not looked up from her phone once.
What is she even doing on that thing?
- She's six!

So, I said, "Honey.

And she turned to look, and I grabbed her cell phone and I threw it overboard.
And after that, we had the best time.
Unfortunately, it was her mom's phone.
I hate cell phones.
I liked it better when if you needed to get a hold of somebody, you just shot up a flare.
Okay, enough about me and my trip.
This always happens.

You tell a story, Beau.
Okay.

I was at the feedstore the other day to get some baling twine.
They always keep it on aisle three, 'bout chest high... but it wasn't there.
So I go up to the counter and ask Glenn.
He says, "We're out.

So I gotta go back on Tuesday.
Wow, I got to call you on Wednesday so I can get the thrilling conclusion.
Man, this storm is not letting up.
Mmm.
Well, I guess we'll just have to keep drinkin'.
Mmm.

- I'm glad you came over, Joanne.

I missed you, Beau.
All right, you did it.

- I gotta get that.

If that's one of my boys, I'm gonna kill him.
Hey, Beau.

- Can I come in?

Mary?
Hey, Joanne, what are you doing here?
Oh, my God.
No, it's not like that.

I just came to return his binoculars.
Oh, is that what the kids are calling it these days?
Well, I'm...

- What?

- Where's... where's Rooster?

But he is over there, sitting in the dark, freezing his balls off 'cause he doesn't think he's welcome here with you.
He's smarter than I thought.
Go get him, Beau.
If he gets cold enough, he'll shoot up a flare.
Please.
- Fine.

Oh, and it's, uh... it's cold out there, so don't forget your hat.
This is not how I want to be found dead.
Should've read the rest of Johnny G.'s Yelp review.
"I've had worse, but only in prison."
I'm sorry.
Nah, it's all right.

No, it's nine o'clock.
We should be sitting front row at Garth Brooks right now, listening to him sing "The Storm."
Front row?

Front row of the balcony.

You gotta puke, it's only a problem for the rich guy sittin' below you.
I'm bummed out too, but it's not your fault we got stuck.
- Are you gonna leave me?

It's always somethin' with us.
You and Kenny, right?

Your parents hating' me.
A blizzard on your birthday.
Not the good kind with Oreos.
Okay, where is this coming from?
I don't know.
I'm afraid one day you're gonna wake up and be like, "Why am I with Colt Bennett?"
I wake up like that every day.
I'm serious.
Why are you with me?
Really?
Colt... you're the sweetest, most romantic person I've ever met.
Hey, do you know what Kenny did for my birthday every year?
We'd go to Applebee's and get two appetizers, two entrées and two desserts.
Say what you want, but the Two-Two-Two for $22?
That's just a good deal.
You always surprise me.
You wrote "Colt Loves Abby" on the water tower.
Okay, you... you hide McGriddles in my desk at school so I can find them in the morning.
Sure, sometimes I don't check my desk for a week or two and the janitor has to get rid of it with gloves... but I appreciate the gesture.
You make life exciting.
Why can't we have fun?
Remember how easy it used to be?
We'd just, like, ditch school and go tubing'.
Or ditch school and go fishing.
Or ditch school and go...
- How'd I graduate?

We were 17.

We're older.

That doesn't mean we still can't have fun.
That's another thing I love about you, you're the most fun person I have ever met.
I think what you mean is I'm the "funnest" person you've ever met.
You see?
Your whimsical disregard for the rules of grammar amuses me.
It's all how you look at things.
There is nothing stopping us from being happy right this second.
- You're saying get drunk?

You should've trimmed those trees last fall when I told you to.
Yeah.

What you doing here?
You can come down and stay at the house tonight if you want.
No, thanks.

- All right.

Things okay over at your ranch?
You get your calves in before the storm?
Yeah.

I don't do that one about the cow jumping over the moon, though.
You know, I don't want to give 'em any ideas.
You got someone there to break the ice off the tanks?
Jesus, Dad.
Well, you're gonna hear about it anyway.

- What did you do?

Well, I bailed you out of jail, now you're fired?
Just got...

Make it so fucking complicated.
I mean, ranching is not rocket science.
Birth a cow, raise a cow, kill a cow.

You shouldn't have left here before you were ready.
Yeah, you told me a million times.
It's called parenting.
Birth a son, raise a son, tell a son when he's wrong.

Whatever.
So what are you gonna do?

I'm gonna come back here and be your number two?
Technically, it's number three.

That's what I need, Dad, come back here and have you tell me how to run a ranch.
If you knew how, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
Then maybe we should stop having this conversation.
It's fine by me.
Found one of my boys' sleeping bags.
Hello?
Shit.
Are you kidding me?
- You having fun yet?

Guy in the urinal next to me pissed all over my boots.

Got a special request for this next song.
This one goes out to Colt Bennett.
Well, that's funny.

I get it.
