Where's Percy?
They moved me to gen pop.
Your computer specialist has been involved in committing federal cybercrime.
Is this worth risking your career over?
We catch the killer,
Pride has a chance to bring down Hamilton.
Hamilton removed police services weeks ago.
Set up a slush fund to buy up properties.
Forced people out who wouldn't sell.
Who are you?
My new security consultant, Mr. Stone.
Mr. Stone, Hamilton's guy.
Sounds like they're talking about some kind of hit.
Take down Hamilton once and for all.
(seagulls squawking)
Stand by.
We're one street over, on Fulton.
Want us to alternate?
Let's see what he's up to.
All right, we know he's planning a hit on somebody, and, uh, we could've arrested him, but we decided to let him go.
No, I chose to let him go.
We've been tailing him all the way from Clearwater.
Maybe he's hightailing it.
Already?
But be careful.
I don't know what you're gonna find.
(boat horn honking in distance)
(tires screeching)
(jazz music playing, lively chatter)
(band playing upbeat jazz music)
(horn honking)
(gunfire, people screaming)

Get down!

(camera clicking)
(siren wailing)
You all right?
No, I'm not.
Stone just opened fire.
Crowded street.
Didn't care about hurting anybody else, just wanting to get away from me.
We got to find out who this joker really is.
Well, he obviously doesn't think we can.
Otherwise, he wouldn't have done something like this.
Yeah, well, whatever Hamilton's up to has got to be a lot worse than we thought.
Hire somebody like that.
Because we don't know who Stone really is or who he's after.
Still, we're following up on leads from prior NCIS cases--
Garcia, Clearwater.
We know Hamilton's behind this all.
Yeah, but, we're the only ones who do.
And without solid evidence...
It's not an NCIS case.
(woman crying)
You find anything out at the warehouse?
Lobster, oyster tanks, packing materials, nothing unusual.
No trace of Stone's pals.
Stone drove there specifically from Clearwater.
There's got to be a reason.
Call Sebastian, get him out there, scour the place.
The only problem is we have Sebastian checking surveillance hoping to find Stone, while also trying to figure out who his target is.
We're spread very thin here, thanks to the good mayor doing everything he can to break us apart.
Only good news is we're working on something to try to get the judge to rescind Sonja's contempt charge.
Yeah, hopefully get her out of there before the other prisoners eat her alive.
Okay, well, go, make that happen.
If we can't find Stone, we got to figure out who he's after.
'Cause whoever it is and why is the key to nailing Hamilton.
(crying)
It's not your fault, Pride.
No, it's Hamilton's.
Are you out of your mind?
The shooting's all over the news.
All that matters is we're on track for tomorrow.
My team cleaned out the warehouse before NCIS found anything.
So why are you here?
Concerned about what?
Pride.
No matter what you do to him or his team, they keep on investigating.
I'll handle Pride.
Meantime, get out of here.
I got a presentation to prepare.
Your friend's in a lot of trouble.
Contempt of court is a serious offense, Agent Lasalle.
I understand, Your Honor.
But you don't understand what'll happen if you don't let her out.
All right, I don't have any proof of this, but a powerful politician, a corrupt one, is trying to do everything in his power to keep us from busting him.
And every day Percy is in prison not only puts her at risk because of the strings he's pulled, but makes it easier for him to get away with murder.
(sighs)
But something very bad is gonna happen here if you don't help us.
There's too many gaps in city surveillance cameras.
I kept losing him in alleys.
I'm-I'm not as good at this as Sebastian or Patton, obviously.
But, uh, maybe Patton should...
No, I don't want to risk it.
FBI finds out Patton's doing cyber anything, he ends up in jail, too.
Besides, Sebastian thinks he might've found something on the Clearwater tape.
Looks like maybe a... corner building with a large kitchen.
Yeah?
Probably in Orleans Parish, based on what I can make of the maps.
I think that this is the cathedral.
It's about the right distance from the river.
So Stone's targeting a restaurant in the Quarter?
Looks like.
Problem is there are a lot of corner restaurants there.
We got to narrow it down if we got any hope of stopping him.
Roy?
Sorry, Patton, we were in your office.
Just so we're clear, I am coming back.
You better.
We're a little pressed for time, Patton, so unless you got something...
Oh, I got something.
But if the FBI come calling, that's because I kind of, sort of tapped into their central server.
But you ain't hear that from me.
Check it out.
Who are they?
Seven VIPs who all happen to be flying into New Orleans tomorrow with a lot of secrecy and even more security.
Vice Admiral Thompkins, Congresswoman Angelou.
She's head of the Armed Services Committee.
Too big a coincidence for it not to be connected to Hamilton and Clearwater, right?
Because whoever Stone is targeting, we know it's tomorrow.
The question is:
which one is the target?
We find that, we find Stone.
Then catch him in the act, nail Hamilton, and I ain't hiding out in no damn morgue anymore.
Speaking of which, Doc wanted me to tell you that she's getting the shooting Vic transferred here.
Between the bullet and the casing, we're hoping we can figure out who Stone really is.
And good work getting us those names, Patton.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Guys, you're not gonna believe this.
A fish tank?
All I do know is that this is the only thing in that warehouse that hadn't been bleached clean.
Thinking maybe his hit squad missed it?
Yeah, that's a good question, deserves a follow-up.
But I wasn't talking about the fish tank when I said you're not gonna believe it, or frankly, like it.
This city, our city, deserves better.
And as you all know, this is not the first time NCIS and lead agent Pride have treated our streets like some kind of Wild West shootout.
This is outrageous, it's unconscionable, and I promise to do something about it once and for all.
(phone beeps)
I've personally spoken with the director of NCIS...
Turn it off.
Deputy Director Sanchez, NCIS, wants to talk to me now.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Dwayne, you're in a lot of trouble here.
I'm telling you, Dan, this is all a bunch of crap.
Mayor Hamilton...
Has formally requested to relocate you and your team to another city.
Because I'm onto him.
Because he knows that I know what he's really up to.
And what exactly is he up to?
Well, I-I don't have any clear proof just yet, but he's...
There is no "buts," Dwayne.
NCIS is supposed to be a guest in cities, under the condition that we don't make waves.
And, frankly, lately, you've done nothing but make waves.
Dan, listen to me.
No, you listen to me.
You're one of the best we've got.
That's why we give you so much slack.
But now it's become a problem.
And we can't afford to lose New Orleans as a base of operations to protect the Gulf.
You are hereby ordered to stand down, Agent Pride.
If you do not, I'll have your badge, do you understand me?
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Look who I found.
So happy to see you!
Oh, I'm so glad to be out.
Whoa, you-you, uh, you showered first, right?
Wait, what's that?
Just the lice epidemic in prison's kind of crazy right now...
Get over here, idiot.
I can't believe the affidavit worked.
I honestly didn't think it would.
My hero.
Well, I'm not so sure we have a case anymore.
Pretty sure Pride just got an ass-chewing from HQ.
He's M.I.A.
Is that because of the shooting yesterday?
The man doesn't give up, does he?
Yeah, well, neither do we.
Gregorio, let's get Percy up to speed.
All right, learn everything you can about the seven targets.
We need to figure out which one Stone's after.
Let's go.
All right.
Where are we on this fish tank?
Still fishing.
All right, well, get on it.
We need leads when Pride resurfaces.
Sooner we connect Hamilton to all this, sooner things get back to normal.
That's not the way it works.
Well, then what is the answer, Loretta?
Hamilton's picking us apart.
Forcing us to focus more on saving ourselves than going after him.
It's what he wants, and it's working.
Not at this rate.
According to the director, the only way to save my team, to keep us in New Orleans, is to drop the case.
Which means let Hamilton go.
Which is also what Hamilton wants, because the more you go rogue, the more ammunition he has to use against you.
You're your own worst enemy.
I'm not gonna let him get away with this.
And I'm not gonna let another innocent person die.
How can I?
So why are you here?
So I can politely listen, nod, tell you you're right?
Because if that's what you want, then you sure as hell don't know me as well as I thought you did.
Ouch.
Look, Dwayne, as far as I'm concerned, after what Hamilton threw at you,
I don't blame you for being pissed.
But I'm telling you, the more personal you make this, the more difficult it's gonna be to see your way through.
Just don't make it about Hamilton.
Make it about stopping a bad guy from doing a bad thing, from hurting anyone else.
And use your team.
You built them, they're good, eager, loyal.
They'll follow you down any rabbit hole.
And you know it.
Probably wouldn't be able to stop them, anyway.
You should have been a shrink, you know that?
I prefer corpses.
Some of us were getting a little worried, but I won't name names.
Don't listen to him for a second.
He was worried, too.
He's just trying to be tough.
Sorry for the radio silence.
I just had to think things through.
Yeah, that's another way of saying
Miss Loretta had to kick his butt.
Enough to find Stone's real I.D.?
But it's enough to connect Stone to both Javier Garcia and the FBI agents' murder from way back when.
And to that Chinese operative tried to steal the Navy's ship-activation CPU a few weeks ago.
Wait, but killing the guy actually helped the Navy keep the program alive.
It doesn't make sense.
Hamilton had Garcia killed to keep his mouth shut, but then he kills a Chinese operative, which turned out to be a good thing?
It only makes sense if it's good for Hamilton.
The sooner I get my damn office back.
And the sooner I get payback, see Hamilton behind bars instead of me.
Welcome back, Sonja.
Word is HQ is still pretty pissed at us.
Actually, more me than you.
Still, it goes without saying, if any of you want to bow out...
I think you know us better than that.
In for a penny, in for a pound.
Which brings us back to Stone and who his next target is.
No, not yet, but at least we know what they're doing in New Orleans.
Yeah, and they're not incoming anymore, they're already here.
Apparently for some shindig at city hall tonight.
I hacked...
I mean, I accidentally stumbled across the NOPD and the FBI communications coordinating security-- it's big-time.
It's got to be the big secret, right?
Whatever Hamilton's plan is.
Can we bug one of the guests before they go in?
Not all of 'em.
All right, look, uh, you know, either we do this or we don't, okay?
I got people waiting.
Told you to come alone.
Yeah, I don't go anywhere without NOPD.
Especially here.
After all, desperate men do desperate things.
Frisk him.
You can wait outside.
Now, you know I'm only here 'cause you said you wanted to save your team's jobs, right?
That's right.
Only one way that's gonna happen.
And that's if you back the hell off me, and I mean all the way off.
You don't get conditions, Dwayne.
All you have to do is confess to killing Garcia and the FBI agents and the Clearwater pastor and your connection to Stone.
Oh, man, you are out of your mind.
You are out of your damn mind... (shouts)
to everything you've done!
And if I can't get you the needle,
I'm gonna make damn sure you spend the rest of your miserable, corrupt life in prison!
(panting)
Oh... you are finished, Dwayne.
You are finished in this town, do you understand?
You and your whole damn team.
You're done!
Let's get out of here.
(phone beeps)
(line ringing)
Bug's in Hamilton's coat pocket, Patton.
Copy that, Pride. (Hamilton shouting) I hear him loud and clear.
And let me tell you, he is pissed.
So am I.
(siren wailing)
(indistinct police radio chatter)
It's 15 after.
We only saw six of the seven potential targets enter so far, King.
Which means no sign of the congresswoman yet.
(sirens wailing)
Here comes another police escort.
They're all here.
So let me make it worth your while.
Turn it up.
Uh, I know it's been a long, arduous process, but, um, it's my hope, this evening, to convince those of you who are still holding out-- uh, I'm not gonna name any names, now,
(clears throat) Congresswoman-- uh, to convince you once and for all why Clearwater, why New Orleans is the best candidate for the first naval shipyards to be built in our country in decades.
Come on, come on around here.
Yeah, that's right.
Ah, she's a beauty, isn't she?
Now, as you know, unlike the Georgia option, Clearwater is all but shovel-ready.
And on top of that, we offer easy Gulf and Panama Canal access.
We got plenty of slips for stealth destroyers and nuclear subs and whatnot.
And we also have enough land and infrastructure to build high-tech centers-- centers which will allow the Navy to open the first ship-activation centers east of San Diego.
Something D.O.D. has long coveted.
Guess that answers that question.
Well, I'm actually glad that you asked that, Admiral, because our research says that 11,000 full and part-time jobs will be created, both civilian and military.
Which would be a much-needed boon to both New Orleans and Louisiana, I imagine.
And great press for the Navy.
Great press for you, too, Mr. Mayor.
As well as a boon to whatever political aspirations you may have.
Might as well start calling him Governor Hamilton now.
(scoffs) Over Pride's dead body.
Th-This is not about me, Congresswoman.
It's not about me.
Folks around here have been ignored by D.C. for too long.
We're still recovering from Katrina.
Now, this will help New Orleans.
I make no bones about that.
But it will also help America and the Navy, too.
How does it help the residents of Clearwater?
Uh, s-sorry?
Well, we will relocate them.
Affordable housing has already been designed into the entire process.
...they're still there.
You want to break ground next month, but people are still living on the very site.
It's not even cleared.
We know that you are the lone holdout here.
But since you're the head of the Armed Services Committee, we also know that your vote holds great sway.
So is there anything I can do or say to convince you before the final vote?
No.
Because I still think the Georgia site's a better alternative.
What do you think, King?
I think Hamilton will do anything to get that shipyard.
Which means that poor congresswoman is obviously Stone's next target.
Question is: how do we save her?
We don't even know where Stone is or when and where he's planning the hit.
Can't exactly warn her.
We're not even supposed to know about this.
Hell, we're not even supposed to be on the case.
Wait, wait, you two are supposed to be watching the congresswoman!
We handed it off to Lasalle and Percy.
They're there, don't worry.
Sorry.
Did you get any sleep?
Patton checked surveillance cameras, he's-he's used facial recognition, nothing.
Yeah, she's in her room, Capitol Police are guarding her.
Stone's not gonna make his move until she leaves.
How do you know?
'Cause he's not gonna take her out and make it look like a hit.
Be too easy for authorities to connect it to the shipyard vote, maybe even to Hamilton.
We just got to figure out which one.
Yeah, it's got to be a seafood restaurant 'cause of that fish tank, which, by the way,
I've been working on in my old lab.
Seems like they were cultivating some kind of a fungus inside.
Yeah, well, go see if anything's turned up.
Go!
Protect the congresswoman, catch Stone in the act, use him to bust Hamilton.
We got this, Pride.
Save the day, save your badge.
I don't care about my badge.
Where-where are you going?
So far, we don't have anything.
Pride!
Just want to be prepared, that's all.
Prepared for what?
Media's gonna want answers.
I-I'm the one that invited her to come here, remember?
Just tell them New Orleans is a dangerous town.
Don't be smug with me.
Just answer my question.
Couple hours, it'll be done.
Couple hours?
That soon?
Wh-What was that?
What happened?
Don't worry about it.
Right now, the bigger issue is Pride.
He needs to be dealt with.
(phone beeps)
Wonder what the record is for shortest stint as an NCIS field agent.
Always wanted to be the best at something.
I kind of wish it wasn't that.
Yeah, well, at least you'll be free.
Broke but free.
Me?
I'm looking at five to ten hard, and undoubtedly with a bunk mate named Bubba.
Any luck tapping into the congresswoman's itinerary?
No offense, but your old lab computers are not exactly set up for a Triple P hacking.
That's not cool.
Man, don't go getting sensitive.
Man, it's not personal.
What is it?
Who is that?
No, it's not a who, it's an algae.
I just found trace elements of it in the fish tank.
At first I thought it was a fungus, but...
I take it it isn't?
No, you ever hear of red tide?
You know, a-a microscopic algae that sometimes grows in oysters in the Mississippi?
Yeah, that stuff is deadly, isn't it?
Yeah, very.
(sighs) Anything happening?
No, congresswoman's still inside, safe and sound, I hope.
Caramel Macchiato.
Extra shot, right?
Thank you.
What's Pride doing here?
(trolley bell dinging)
I'll get your keys for you, sir.
Just leave it there.
NCIS.
I need to speak with the--
Congresswoman.
Special Agent Pride, NCIS.
Sorry to bother you, but it's important.
What's this about?
It's about the shipyard and Mayor Hamilton.
I'll be right there.
Why does NCIS know about the shipyard?
NCIS doesn't, I do.
I can't explain why I know what I know, but I have to tell you, Hamilton is not gonna let you vote.
He's gonna stop you.
He's gonna try and kill you.
What?
That's ridiculous.
No, no, listen.
I'm sorry, but pl-please.
You got to believe me.
Me and my team have been tracking a hit squad, and we have every reason to believe they're connected to Hamilton and that you're their next target.
Do you have proof of this?
No, not exactly, no.
But I'm-I'm telling you, I know Hamilton, and he'll do anything to keep you from voting.
Or maybe you're just trying to scare me.
New Orleans has a long history of corrupt officials.
This looks like just another example.
No, no, no, you don't understand.
You tell your mayor friend...
He's not my friend.
...I will not be intimidated by you or anybody else.
That shipyard will never be built in Clearwater, ever.
Good day.
Look, Congresswoman, I'm just...
(siren wailing)
(cell phones chime)
(trolley bell dinging)
(engine starts)
King, King!
We just got a text from Patton.
He's got the congresswoman's itinerary.
Yeah, and she's headed to lunch with Admiral Thompkins at Beaux's Oyster Bar, corner restaurant.
Red tide.
(tires screeching)
(siren wailing)
(siren wailing)
(horn honking)
(horn continues honking)
I seem to recall you like white wine.
(horn honking) Get out of the way!
(siren wailing, tires screeching)
Oh, here we go.
Compliments of the house.
Wow, isn't this pretty?
(siren wailing)
(horn honking)
(siren approaching)
A little lemon.
(tires screeching)
(horn honking)
Come on, let's go!
Hands up!
Don't move!
I'm okay.
Now, fortunately, nobody was injured.
However, the investigation into...
They ain't got a clue of what was going on.
King saved that woman's life.
Yeah, not even the congresswoman.
I mean, even if they test those oysters, the red tide will look like it was naturally occurring.
There's no way anybody would think that it was intentional.
But that's Stone's play, to make it look like an accident.
Yeah, which means King's a hero, and the media's trying to spin it like he's some crazed maniac.
You mean Hamilton's trying to spin it.
HQ can't really blame him for doing the right thing, can they?
So, what do you think is gonna happen?
They're suspending us.
Pending further review, deputy director's ordered us to stand down, cease and desist all NCIS activities.
Yeah, if it wasn't for you, that congresswoman would be dead.
She's still in danger, too.
Which means, if we don't do something...
There is no "we" anymore, all right?
At least not until HQ figures it out.
Which means for now,
"we" aren't doing anything.
Is that understood?
HQ's not messing around anymore, and neither am I.
I'm the one who dragged you into this, and for that I am truly sorry.
I'm beyond grateful for your loyalty, but it's not just my badge at stake anymore.
Now, it's over!
Go home!
'Cause he would have had to know exactly what we were doing, when we were doing it.
And besides, I don't know how and when.
That's supposed to be your job, which, by the way, you been screwing up so much that we got no other choice anymore.
I'm shutting it down, that's what it means.
This is so out of control that I have to put a stop to it before it bites all of us in the ass.
Well, that's not just up to you.
And I doubt the others would agree.
No, we haven't.
We still have one chance to save your precious shipyard.
Problem is there's someone out there who's not gonna give up trying to stop you.
Unless you let me put a stop to him first.
(door opens)
(door closes) You know, with all the people you've pissed off in your life, you'd at least think you'd lock your door.
I heard about the suspension.
I just wanted to see if you were okay.
I'm fine.
Ah.
Yeah, well, could have fooled me.
Loretta, look...
I don't need any speeches or pep talks or anything else right now.
I just need you to leave.
Not until you tell me what's going on.
And I'm gonna put an end to this once and for all.
Dwayne, you're scaring me.
I'm sorry.
You know I love you, you know I'd do anything for you, but I don't want you trying to talk me out of this.
Out of what?
I tried to do it your way,
I tried to do the right thing with my team, but it got 'em in more trouble.
And I'm not putting 'em through anything more.
This is my job now!
You're going after Hamilton.
Somebody has to.
And since nobody else has any idea what the hell he's really up to, it's gonna be me.
And I will, if it's the last thing I do.
What do you mean, "If it's the last thing I do"?
Make sure NCIS gets this.
It says that I take full responsibility for forcing my team to do everything.
Dwayne, you're taking this too personally!
You're damn right I'm taking it personal!
I should've stopped Hamilton a long time ago!
Get out of my way!
Dwayne, wait, your phone!
