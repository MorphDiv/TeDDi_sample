_
In the criminal justice system, sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous.
In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit.
These are their stories.
This is honor.
This is service.
This is courage.
This is Captain Beth Williams.
This is the United States Army...

What do you think, Captain?
I'm honored and humbled, sir.
Be humble on your own time.
You're one of the best soldiers we have.
Silver Star, first female Ranger, three confirmed kills.
We didn't just pull your name out of a hat.
Now it's time for the country to hear your story.
Once you're off leave, I will escort you on a three-month media tour throughout this great nation of ours.
Lots of bright lights, lots of cameras.
This is your new mission.
[indistinct chatter]
Beth.
- Hey.

Hey.

Hey, babe.
Hey.
So, uh, have you two love birds set a date yet or what?
Next year, May 20th.

Yeah.
Speech, speech, speech, speech... [everyone chanting]

Hey!

People are always asking what drives me.
When thing's get tough, and I have to dig deep, where do I find my strength?
It's here... my home, my family, my friends.
You're my strength.
Thank you for always believing in me.
So here's champagne for our real friends, and real pain for our sham friends.
[laughter]
- Let's drink!

- Hear!

[laughter]
Cheers.
[tense music]
♪ ♪ [groaning]
Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?

Don't move, you're hurt.

[groans]
Yes, uh, I need an ambulance.
Fin, what do we got?
The vic's name is Beth Williams.

She's in bad shape.

You said she was sexually assaulted?
It looked that way.

She had blunt force trauma to the back of the head.
And what else do we know about her?
UNI found her military ID.
She's a captain in the United States Army.
- You're kidding me.

She's a Ranger... best of the best.
That's why I called you, Liv.
I thought you'd wanna be early on this.
"Captain Beth Williams, 26.
"Born and raised in Queens.
"First woman to graduate Ranger school.
Three tours in Iraq.

So a local girl makes good, and this is her "welcome home" present.
[dramatic music]
♪ ♪
So there's our blunt force object.
CSU's running it, seeing if we can get any prints.
Hey, CSU found Beth's backpack under a bush.
Look it what was inside. 50 C-notes.
Hey, Fin, when you were a Ranger, you ever walk around with 5 grand?
More like $5.
So what?

Maybe that's not what he was after.
Question is why is she walking around with 5 Gs cash?
Yeah, could be any number of reasons, but this neighborhood kinda narrows it down.
Let's not jump to any conclusions.
Fin, why don't you coordinate with the Army CID, and see if they know anything that might be helpful.
Carisi, get with Rollins at the hospital.
I'll meet you there.
And let's find out what Captain Williams was doing up here last night.
_
Rollins, how's Beth doing?
She just got out of Neuro-ICU.
Uh, and they sutured up her head wound.
Sounds like she's doing okay.
But they are gonna keep her here under observation, until they can rule out complications.
- Okay, can we talk to her?

The doctor said yes, as long as we keep it short.
I'm glad she's all right.
Sounds like he got pretty brutal.
Yeah, but she put up a hell of a fight herself.
She had several offensive wounds... lots of cuts and scratches on her knuckles.
Makes sense.

And there's some blood on her legs.
Some of it could've come from the perp.
Yeah, the guy gets cut during the tussle.
Okay, so let's run it.

Yeah, and, uh, family's been contacted.
The mom and the fiancé are in the waiting room.
All right, so you two talk to the family.
I'll talk to Beth.
Did you see Beth last night?
Well, we had, uh, a little party over at Mickey and George's to celebrate her graduation from Ranger school.
I left early, and... and Beth said she'd be home later.
When she didn't show up, I just... you know, I just figured she...

Sylvia, um... we found a lot of cash in Beth's backpack.
It's $5,000.
Do you know of any reason why she'd be walking around
- with that kinda money?

- Beth?

I'm Lieutenant Benson from the Special Victims Unit.
Are you feeling well enough to talk?
It's gonna be okay.
I promise.
Thank you.

I know that this is tough, but I'd like to ask you a few questions about the assault, if that's okay.
Okay.
Do you know who did this to you?
I can't believe this really happened.
The timing is...
This is the last thing I need right now.
- What do you mean?

The goal is to project strength, courage, power.
I can't be in here talking about getting raped, for God's sake.
First of all, Beth, nothing has changed.
You're the same person that you were before this... the same strong person.
Do you think you can tell me what happened?
Do you know who did this to you?
I wanna talk to Major Dantley.
He's my superior officer.
Okay, I understand that.
But the more you can tell me, the more helpful I can be.
[door opens]
Excuse me, Lieutenant, we need to take Ms. Williams upstairs for more tests.
If you could just give me two more minutes.
We need to do this quick.
I've already discussed all this with the other detective.
I'm okay.

- You got any news on Beth?

They're still running tests, but the doctors are hopeful.
She called me when she got here... told me to come.
She said she can't remember anything?
With her type of injury, that... that's common.
You just gotta give this time, Mickey, okay?
Listen, I'm gonna have to ask you guys some questions now, okay?
All right, so this... this party...

Around 11:00.

And you didn't offer to walk her home?
She didn't want me leaving the party on her account.
Beth's pretty independent.
Does Beth usually carry lots of cash?
Cash?

Well, we found $5,000 in her backpack.
Any idea where that came from?
No clue.
What did you two guys do after the party?
Well, we stayed up playing Xbox.
I asked Beth to stay...

We shouldn't have let her leave alone.
Listen, uh, George, why don't you give me and Mickey a few minutes.
All right?

Hey, listen, Mickey, I'm gonna have to talk to you about some pretty personal stuff now.
It's standard procedure.

Did you and Beth have sex in the past 48 hours?
Um, yeah.
I mean, we haven't seen each other in five months, so...
Okay, did you use a condom?
No, um...

Okay, I'm gonna...

Um, yeah.
They're calling her the face of Army 2.0,
Captain Beth Williams, the first woman to graduate from the rigorous Ranger training program is set to embark on a publicity tour showcasing the Army's new and more progressive attitude.
The hope is that the Captain Williams marketing campaign will help with the current recruiting efforts.
Now, Captain Williams was kept to the same standards as the men, that's thanks to the Army's new gender-integrated assessment program which guarantees parity, regardless of gender.
She's as strong as any of the male Rangers.
- Impressive.

Found this hater online.
He's one of those Men's Rights Movement guys.
Check out those posts.

"might as well be Captain Crunch.
Army ain't what it used to be.

"I think I saw Captain Hot Pants
"waiting for the N train today.
"Next time, I'll do a service for the country, and push her onto the tracks." Yeah.
- The N train sounds local.

Okay, so some loser who lives in his parents' basement hates women.

So this is the closest thing we have to a lead, so let's track down Superman for real, and find out where he was last night.
I'll call Barba...

Sergeant.
- Who's that guy?

Captain Williams has been serving under him for the past two years he'll be traveling around the country with her on her press tour.
Detective Tutuola got in touch with me about Captain Williams.
- Horrible.

Anything you need, please know you have our full support.
Oh, thank you, Major.

As I'm sure you can understand, it's in everyone's best interest if this tragic event remains confidential.
Last thing we want...

Well, I think we can both agree that our primary concern is what's best for Captain Williams.
Terrific.

Well, if that's what she wants.
Ultimately it's her decision.
You know, some survivors prefer to go public.
It encourages other women to come forward.
Of course.
So, Major, um, do you have any idea what Captain Williams was doing at 207th street
- at 4:00 in the morning?

Were you aware of any issues, or any problems?
No, ma'am. [knocking on door]
Excuse me, Lieutenant, a word?
Excuse me, Major.
Rape kit came back.
The semen DNA's a match for Mickey Reid, her fiancé, as to be expected.
- So the perp wore a condom?

We didn't find any traces of lubricant.
I'm guessing the guy didn't finish.
The good news is that the lab did find somebody else's blood on Beth's skin.
- He in the system?

Jose Marquez, 35.
He's got a rap sheet from here to Yonkers, including felony assault.
_
Excuse me, guys, looking for Jose Marquez.

You guys, Jose Marquez?
That's me.
Do me a favor...

Yeah, we got a few questions about where you were last night.
I'm a little busy right now.

No, it can't.
Why don't you start with what happened to your eye.
I got in a fight.
With Beth Williams?
Yeah, you could say that.
Why are you asking?

Yeah, and your blood was found on her legs, Jose.
Yeah, well, that makes sense.
- How's that?

[cheering] [indistinct cheers and applause]
Is that what I think it is?
Yeah.
It's a fight club, man.
[cheering]
[all chanting] Beth!

Beth!

I already told you, people.

Hell, I couldn't even get a jab in there.
- I was just trying to get my...

- where was this fight?

It's always at the warehouse on 203rd street.
That's four blocks from where Beth was assaulted, Jose.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you might have a fragile ego.
You don't like getting your ass kicked by a woman.
Oh, come on, man.
Home girl kicked my ass fair and square.
I got nothing but mad respect for her.
Listen, does anybody ever bet on these fights?
- Yeah, everyone.

There's a purse... $5,000.
Winner take all... all cash.
- And when did you leave?

It was 3:30 in the morning.
My wife took me to see the doctor, so I could get these.
I'm not your guy.

[sighs]
Look, I'm no angel, but this particular thing...

She gave me a beat down, and that's the last time I saw her.
Hey.
Doctor says you're feeling better.
- I am.

So Beth...
I prefer Captain Williams, ma'am.
Oh, okay.
Okay.

Whatever you prefer.
So, Captain Williams... were you able to remember any of the details, or...
No.
I tried, but it's still a bit foggy.
That's all right.
So how 'bout we start at the beginning, and we'll just take it from there.
You were at the party earlier that evening at your fiancé's apartment.
Yes.
Okay, and where'd you go after that?
Do you remember being at the fight club?
It's okay, Captain.

I promise you that.
I appreciate that, ma'am.
And you are correct.
I participated in a mixed martial arts event that evening.
I needed to make some quick money.
My mom has early Parkinson's, and there's an experimental drug she needs that isn't covered by insurance.
All right, so did... did any of the men come onto you?
Were they disrespectful?
No one came onto me.
Okay.

My old martial arts coach runs it.
Uhhuh.

4:26.

- Were you with anyone?

Did you see anyone following you?
No, I obviously let my guard down.
No, you didn't do anything wrong.
This... this isn't on you.
I respectfully disagree, ma'am.
As a Ranger, I'm taught to stay mentally alert, physically strong, and morally straight.
Under no circumstances, will I ever embarrass my country.
A predator raped and assaulted you.
Embarrassment doesn't even enter the conversation.
I suppose we see things differently.
Okay.
Thank you.
You know, I know that this is, uh, difficult, Captain.
And I just want to assure you that I will do everything in my power to find the person who's responsible for this.
And what do I do, Lieutenant?
What's my mission?
To heal.
Jose Marquez's alibi checks out.
He was at a 24-hour walk-in clinic called CityMed.
He has a fractured rib too.
Huh, she really did a number on that dude.
And then a couple hours later, she gets beat down.
How does that happen?

Captain Williams was assaulted four blocks from where she fought Jose.
So we think that somebody followed her from the fight club?

I think that we should talk to her martial arts coach.
He's the one who organizes these things.
And get the name of every person who was in that room.
_
I still can't believe what happened.
Beth's a fierce warrior.
- You two are close?

Did any man pay special attention to her the night of the fight?

People came to see two skilled fighters face off.
We take it seriously.

- What time did you leave?

I have a loft in the same building where I hold the fights.

My girlfriend was with me all night.
Okay, we're gonna need to talk to her too.
We also need the names of everybody who was there.
Is that really necessary?

I don't wanna betray anyone's privacy.
This is a rape investigation, Randy.
We're beyond privacy.
And suspect number 20 bites the dust.
Tom Metz let the club at 2:00 a.m.
He got an E-ZPass hit half an hour later on his way home to Stamford.
Well, it's hard to assault somebody in New York
- when you're in Connecticut.

So that leaves what?

We got a real name for this online troll...
"Superman78." His name is Gary Cook.
Gary Cook.

He's on our list.

He's an Army vet...

He has three drug convictions, and in his spare time, he works as a freelance I.T. guy.
Yeah, when he's not trolling Beth online.
Check out what he posted today.
"I saw our Rangerette give quite a show the other night.
I wonder if she screws as good as she fights."
Bring him in. "Superman78"... let's see how tough our Man of Steel really is.
- How's it going?

NYPD...

- About what?

Hm.
Carisi!
- Stay down!

- Hands behind your back!

Stop resisting!
[grunts] [groaning] [grunts] [groans]
Where's the fire, Gary?

[groans]
No fire.

When's the last time you saw Captain Williams?
After the fight, I was having a smoke... saw her leaving.
- Did you follow her?

Okay, so now we're getting somewhere.
I mean, this is confusing, right?
She's hot, but she's full of herself.
She's strong, she's tough, so you gotta show her what a real man can do, right?
Did you hit her, Gary?

I hit her with a firm and respectful handshake.
A handshake?

What pill do you take?

Or are you red pill thinkers?
- Well, what's in the red pill?

And the truth is I cherish women.
- The entire manosphere does so.

If you would chew on this red pill for a moment, perhaps its not a great idea for a woman to be boxing a man at 4:00 in the morning in a warehouse.
Maybe God put women here for nobler purposes.
Right, nobler purposes, like making babies?
Cooking?

Worked for the last thousand years.
What happened after this wonderful handshake, Gary?
I said, "Good fight."
She walked away, then I hopped into a cab to go see my grandma.
Grandma?

Look, he's not helping himself, but there's no DNA match.

How's Captain Williams doing?
Well, she's coming around, but this is really tough for her.
I mean, we don't see a lot of victims that are decorated war heroes.
Yeah, she's used to being the aggressor.
That's part of our creed.

That's why she's really struggling.
Think she can ID this guy?
She says that her memory's still foggy, but maybe if we show her a picture of this Renaissance man, that'll clarify things.
Captain Williams...

Uh, where are you going?
- To my mom's house.

[chuckles] Following my own orders.
Captain, uh, it's just been 24 hours.
Your... your body needs time to recover.
They... they still have to do tests on your head.
Thank you, ma'am, but I'm quite in tune with my body.
Okay, uh, we... we'd like to talk to you in private for a moment... if that's okay.

Him.
- You sure?

I remember that he was smoking a cigarette outside the fight.
And I've seen him creeping around my gym a few times.
Okay, so what about the actual assault?
You remember seeing this man's face?
Yes.
Okay.

Right?

Yeah, he followed me down the block, then I finally turned around and confronted him.
Then I...

- Did he?

He walked away.
So I kept walking towards the subway.
Then I heard footsteps.
I turned...
- It was him.

Yes, ma'am.
Okay.
We'll bring him in.
Captain Williams.
I know how tough you are.

- Sua sponte.

But like we both know, every soldier needs a little RR.
Why don't you stay another day?
Read a book, watch TV.

Thank you, but my mom needs me.
And with all due respect, hanging out in a hospital isn't my idea of RR.
- She's hardcore.

You don't think it's odd that she didn't ask us more about Cook?

She didn't even ask if we were going to arrest him.
Well, see, if she asks about her assailant, she's admitting she let it happen.
So Captain Williams ID'd Gary Cook.
- Let's charge him.

Two problems actually.

Awesome.

Well, turns out that Gary Cook's grandma lives at the St. James Assisted Living Facility.
And I...

They have a sign-in sheet.

No.

4:50 a.m. So where is this?
It's in Yonkers.

So Captain Williams was assaulted between 4:30 and 5:00.
At 207th Street.
It takes 20 minutes to get to that part of Yonkers in a car or train.
- What's the other problem?

This is surveillance footage from an auto glass shop on 203rd Street the night of the assault.
Now there's Beth... all right.
She's walking out of the fight club warehouse.
Right, and there's Gary Cook coming in.
Right, right, right, and he starts to follow her.
Right, which syncs up with Captain Williams' story.
Okay, she's about to shove him, right?
No.

He shakes her hand.

Cook's telling the truth.
Which means that Captain Williams isn't.
Ready?
Excuse me.

We're late getting in the hospital for my mom's treatment.
I'm so sorry.

- What do you need?

Look, I...

You understand that, right?

Okay, so I just wanted to... to make sure that you were clear about... about what you saw, about what you remember.
So if you could just quickly think back to that night.
Are you sure that Gary Cook is the man that attacked you?
Yes.
So here's where we're having the problem.
Two of my detectives found ironclad witnesses, who put Gary Cook 50 blocks from where you were that night.
So you understand what I'm saying.
He... he can't be the guy.
I must've made a mistake.
Okay, please... wait...

I'm just trying to figure this out with you, okay?
I've been called back to base.
I fly out tonight with Major Dantley.
Tonight?
I thought you were staying two weeks for your mother?
- Duty calls.

Give yourself a chance to heal.
Give us a chance to find your assailant and put him behind bars.
And... and in my experience, that will help you find closure.
Soldiers don't need closure, Lieutenant.
Soldiers need a mission.
[engine turns over, car starts]
_
We're in the middle of an active investigation,
Captain Williams was brutally assaulted three days ago.
And we need her help.
You can't just keep her here a few more days?
I got a chain in command, just like you.
Army feels it's best for her to get back with us.
I get that, sir, but he has an important mission here... helping us find the punk that hurt her.
I'm just as worried about Captain Williams as you are.
Hell, I'm a lot more worried.
We've known each other for five years.
She's one of my soldiers...

But she needs to get back to base.
With all due respect, this isn't just about her.
It's about other potential victims.
While this guy is free, he is a threat to other women.
I appreciate that, Lieutenant, but I need soldiers who are engaged in the present, and the longer Captain Williams stays here, stuck in the mire of this unresolved tragedy, the worse it is for all of us.
And the more likely it is the press gets wind of what happened.
- Is that it?

I've known Beth since she was in her slick sleeves... watched her evolve as a person, and as a soldier.
And I'm getting her back to where the hell she belongs, but make no mistake, I'm on her side.
- Trust me on that.

I just hope your approach works.
Okay, so the subway stop
Beth was headed to is right down there.
Closest bar... right near the park.
Only place around here opened late night too.
After you.
Ugh!
There you go.
All the receipts from the night of January 8th.
Your people already went through 'em.
Yeah, well, we're gonna check their homework.
That's a lot of receipts for one night.
Big business, huh?
- Karaoke night.

Did you happen to see this girl walking by that night?
Maybe somebody following her?
That'd be a no, and another no.
Okay, so these are all the people who were here closing.

Or we talk to this guy.
Michael Reid...
- Is this Mickey?

It's the fiancé, and check out the time.
4:25 a.m. That's right around the time
Beth was assaulted a block from here.
Son of a bitch lied to us.
Mickey Reid!

- Hey, what's going on?

- Uh, I don't know.

Or is that what Mickey told you to say?
- Step aside.

Oh, you swear, huh?

- the night Beth was raped?

You ever heard of obstruction of justice?
All right, we're clear.

- We know that.

[sighs]
The morning after it happened, Mickey called... asked me to cover for him.
He said he was out drinking alone all night, and it might look bad.

They're happily engaged.
Actually, Beth broke it off after the party.
That's why she walked home alone.
Mickey was crushed.
- Told her to get out.

They looked pretty cozy at the hospital.
After everything that happened,
I guess Beth changed her mind.
Did Mickey know about the fight club?
Yeah.

Okay.
What time did Mickey really leave the party?
Uhuh, 20 minutes after Beth?
[phone buzzes]
There's no way he could've done this.
Mickey's been in love with Beth since the fifth grade.
Okay, so TARU's up on Mickey's phone.
They've got an address.

- are on their way there now.

850 Como Ave.

There's Mickey's car.
Yeah, Mrs. Williams is at the hospital all night.
- What's he doing here?

Lights are out inside.

NYPD!

[clattering]
- What the hell was that?

Mickey?
Hello?

Clear!
- Basement.

NYPD!

Hello?
- Down here, Lieutenant!

- [grunts, pants]

It's okay!

[grunting, panting]
Do you have a weapon?
I have all I need. [grunts]
Captain Williams!

Step away from him right now!

Hey, Captain Williams, step away.
Hey!

- [screaming] No!

[sobbing]
- It's okay.

- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

- I'm sorry.

- [sobbing]

It's over.
I gotta tell ya, Captain, I am at a loss for words.
- How did we get here?

I had to handle Mickey my way... make him look me in the eye, make him suffer.
But it's over.

It's not your decision whether or not we prosecute.
So you wanna tell me what really happened?
He was so drunk... angry.
I tried to calm him down.
He started getting physical, and I turned to walk away.
- And he hit you?

Mickey and I...
We've been going in different directions for years.
His world kept getting smaller, and my world kept getting bigger.
He obviously has a lot of pent-up anger.
Look, I gotta tell ya.
You've put me in a very difficult position.
You've lost all credibility as a witness, and not to mention what you just did in there is a crime.
- He deserved it.

But the DA's office... not a big fan of vigilante justice.
Are you gonna charge me with a crime?
I don't know.
If you start to cooperate, and help us convict Mickey,
I will talk to the DA, and see if we can help you out.
We're arraigning Mickey tomorrow morning.
I would like you to be there.
[siren wails]
_
People versus Michael Reid.
Are you Michael Anthony Reid?
Is that your true and correct name?
Yes, Your Honor.
On the charge of rape in the first degree,
- how do you plead?

And we request RoR.
Mr. Reid is gainfully employed, has no priors, and has numerous ties to the community.
He is not a flight risk.
[sighs] I cannot believe she's not here.
Given the defendant's record and ties to the community,
I'm denying People's request for remand.
Yes, this is Lieutenant Benson calling from the NYPD.
I'm trying to locate Captain Beth Williams.
Yes, thank you very much.
_
I know that you feel like you've made your peace with this, but I like I said, you need to tell a jury what Mickey did to you.
What I let him do to me.
None of this is on you... none of it.
I was supposed to be a courageous leader, a role model for all the little girls out there.
I feel like a fraud.
Look, something like this changes you.
But it doesn't reduce you.
You can still be that role model.
You are courageous.
And if you testify, I am confident that we can put Mickey behind bars for a very long time.
If I testify... will my name get out there?

But in my work over the years with survivors, there is this amazing power... this freedom... in coming forward.
It's different.
- I'm a soldier.

Rangers lead the way... remember?
- Are you sure?

I'm proud of you, Captain.
Beth.
Good afternoon.
As you know, Michael Reid was just indicted for rape.
I instructed the court to not refer to the victim as Jane Doe.
I feel it is my duty to step forward... to tell the world the truth.
My name is Captain Beth Williams.
On January 8th, I was raped.
This does not lessen my ability or worth as a soldier.
It will not define me.
It will not break me.
I'm not ashamed of what happened.
I stand here with one mission only... to encourage other survivors of sexual assault to do the same.
There is only honor in being a survivor.
