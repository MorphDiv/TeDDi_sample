Mandy:

Roller is missing.
Uncle Daddy:

We gonna get out from underneath all of this mess.
You're a Husser, boy.

You don't owe that man shit.
Oh, no, no!
I-I-I thought the Coombses were in Tallahassee.
He had training today.
I had to cancel it 'cause he saw our old foster parents.
- Which ones?

These people treated us like animals.
Bryce figured out who killed Roller.
Seriously?
Dr. Ken murdered Roller, and Uncle Daddy wants me to kill him.
Kenneth had nothing to do with this.

- No.

Bryce, Bryce, listen to your wife.
Dr. Ken didn't kill Roller.
He was with me that night.
Bryce, he only got the gun because he was afraid of being robbed.
Shut up, all right?
He had Roller's passcodes.
Everybody did.
Your brother had a big mouth.

You have got to get away from these people.
When God gave out crazy, the Hussers got a second helping.
Pol, I'm trying.
I paid Uncle Daddy back, and I'm going to see a new salon today.
Girl, please hurry.
Jenn:

You should take some of that energy home and clean the pool with it.
[Laughs]
[Sighs]
I got to go see Uncle Daddy.
To tell him you quit, right?
You paid back the money from the robbery.
- You're out.

You know, part of living an abundant life is cleaning out ‭the negative influences.
Until we find out ‭who killed Roller, I mean, we're just living under one big cloud of negativity.
Well, I'm positive you can get one of Uncle Daddy's thugs to do it.
Jenn, I...
Honey, I got one baby daddy up in prison.
I don't need another one.
I married you because you were different.
This is my brother, okay, and I need to help find who did this.

Mandy:

If I go two pounds over my perfect weight, my husband hides my heels.
Girl, the last man that put me on a diet got put on a diet from all of this.
- Oh.

When was the last time you had a hamburger or something?
Um, two weeks ago, I went to the drive-thru
- at 3:00 in the morning.

And I let it sit in my mouth for 10 minutes before I spit it out.
Mandy, stop it.
- [Phone rings]

- Hello?

I live behind you on Hammond, with the albino pugapoo.
I know who you are, Carl.
Is everything all right?
Actually, it's not.
See, I was driving from the corner store to get a Lotto ticket, 'cause you know, it's over 100 today, and I just saw your brother.
He is up on a billboard on University Highway wildin' out.
Listen, if you don't want to see him all shot up on the 6:00 news, you need to get down her with a quickness.
[Bird cawing]
What the hell?
Carl:

Dean!

I hate them!

Dean, I know, but this is not how you handle it!
They should die!
Dean, I know you're frustrated, baby, and I know you're confused, but come down and let's breathe this out.
No!

Dean, the doctor said that, when you're frustrated, we should talk about it!
But they broke the law!
They hurt us!
They shouldn't be here!
This...

Baby, we can't control where anybody else lives!
But...

Uh, Virginia was asking about you!
Virginia was...?
No!

No, I'm not!
She was blabbing all around the shop about you!
Please.
Dean, come on, before somebody calls the police.
Can I...

Just one.

Only one?
Okay.
Carl!
Quiet Ann:

I don't know what's going on.
This is batshit.
He's never done anything like that before.
You've got to take him back to the doctor.
He won't go.
Well, then, force him.
Last time you took him to that pricey place, you let him charm the doctors and then walk out the front door.
No, that place misdiagnosed him.
That is not how it happened, and you know that.
Are you calling me an enabler?
Girl, if the press-on fits.
[Clicks tongue]
Hey, honey, we all know that Dean is your whole life, but there are high-functioning autistic adults who live in group homes.
So do crazy people who make meatballs out of their own shit.
- Okay.

Well, I'm not doing it, y'all.

I'm not gonna do it, okay?
There's no individual attention there.
It's just like going in a foster home.
Unless you hit the jackpot, you stuck with people who treat you like shit.
I just got to get Dean away from here.
This is the place you saw today?
Yeah.
It's not as cool as the last one.
Yeah, where's the chandeliers and the big old throne chairs?
Maybe it's at the bitch store with all y'all's attitude.
- [Laughter]

I thought we were running away from Uncle Daddy to the promised land.
This looks like some hole in the wall where they traffic girls and give happy endings to cops.
Ooh, another revenue stream.
How about that?
Des...
You always told us not to lie to you.
You are better than this.
Okay, well, this is all we got.

What's going on, Clay?
Well, let me just cut to the chase, 'cause I don't like to chase, but I do like to cut.
My boy here talking to that Arab over at the big-and-tall shop.
- Hassan?

Now, Hassan said that, on the day my baby boy was murdered, that he saw you two ladies, and you were on each other like butter on a bowl of hot grits.
We...

Well, we heard it was a little more than that.
It was a fight.
Over Roller.

- deeply.

It was over a lot of things, Clay.
Well, the guy from ‭the Messianic Jewish center said you beat Virginia up pretty bad.
And when she got in her car, you said, "Stay away from him."
Is that true, Desna?
I don't...

I mean, what are y'all getting at?
What do you think we're getting at?
We're just trying to figure out who killed Roller here.
Well, it sure as hell wasn't them.
- Jennifer, don't.

- Watch it there now, girl.

My name ain't oki or doke.
First Dr. Ken, now my best friend?
She's the godmother of your Goddamn children.
You better slow your roll, there, blondie.
She better, before I pop her in the face.
Mama.
I'm trying to figure this whole thing out.
Saigon here told me some story straight out of "True Detective"...
Season one.
...and I'm trying to paint a picture.
Now, I know my Roller was into drugs.
I know that.
He liked to party.
So I'm thinking maybe he got a little beef with his candy man, and he's the one who killed him and took that $50,000 out of his safe.
Well, he did say he was having trouble with his drug dealers.
- You got a name?

Well, you best start remembering, 'cause that cockamamie story you told me is starting to stink.
I'm telling you the truth.
You best be.
Now y'all get yourself gone.
You're starting to make me mad.
Come on.
Hey, baby.
Unh-unh, you should be ashamed of yourself.
Jenn:

I don't want the kids coming down with your stupid.
Jennifer, you better get back over here and apologize to my son.
You cannot talk to him like that.
Jennifer!

Baby, come here.

Those hussies know more about Roller's death than they're letting on.
I feel it.
I feel it in my bones.
Damn.
I just talked all that shit and left my cigarettes inside.
What the hell is wrong with you, china doll, huh?
You're like a goddamn fortune teller without a store front.
"Ooh, roller had problems with his drug dealers."
We needed to say something.
No, you needed to keep your pie hole shut!
[Siren walls]
And why in the hell did you take $50,000 from his safe?
Because I thought we were supposed to make this look like a robbery, and now it does.
Boom, problem solved.
So your CSI instincts prompted you to be that damn stupid, huh?
Don't you realize that the more you lie, the easier it is for them to be on to us?
Don't you act all innocent, Desna.
- What?

Listen.
There was at least $20,000 in there.
- Look, girl, let me tell you something.

I saw you.
So, if this is about splitting the coin, honey, we can talk.
We're not equals, dumb-dumb.
Okay, and I'm not your bitch.
Are you clicking back?
Actually, I am.
[Juanda yelling indistinctly]
This little bitch.
Oh, she can't be worse than my mother-in-law.
Did you hear her screaming in there, like a wild woman?
[Gasps]
Is everything all right, baby girl?
Get the hell out!
Get out!
You think you actually gonna get up out of here, huh?
That's exactly what I think, Roller.
I'm getting my salon and I'm getting out from underneath your family's thumb.
You best believe that.

- [Laughs] - ‭Shut up!
You want me to squeeze your neck?
Huh?
You want me to squeeze your neck?
[Laughs]
[Sputtering]
Hey, sugar.
Polly, what the hell are you doing here?
Sit down.

Get the eff out of my house.

You know, it wouldn't take but a minute to peel a bitty thing like you.
Now take a seat like a lady.
Okay.
Now, I hope you like vanilla frosting.
It's organic.
I'd like for you to tell me why you're here.
I have fantastic ‭perception skills, pretty baby.
Your long-winded soliloquy at the clinic, mixed with your general inability to make eye contract plus your constant need to embellish the details have made you very suspect.
Why can't you just talk like a normal person?
See?
You pretend to be a dumb-dumb because it lets you hide.
Yeah, but I know that there are synapses firing off in that pretty little head of yours and you're smarter than we think.
If whatever screwed-up thing you did gets Desna in trouble,
I will cut a bitch.
Are we clear?
[Scoffs]
- Polly, I...

Answer the question.
Are we clear?
Yeah.

Good.
Now, eat up.
Ooh, they're still warm from the oven.
Be a shame if they got cold.
See?

Mm-hmm.
Deanie?
You scared me yesterday.
Sorry, Des.
I know you're in a lot of pain about what happened to us when we were younger.
And...
I look at this scar every day and remember that, but we got to move on.
Why...

I didn't want you to get arrested.
Why...

[Sighs]
Dean.
I want to do the exercise that the doctor taught us where you repeat after me.
No, no.
- No, yes.

The doctor told us it was good for you.
Dean, no, listen.
It's gonna help you understand that the Coombses can't hurt us anymore.
Come on.
The Coombses are on a picture.
Say it, Dean.
Come on.
The Coombses are on a picture.
They can't hurt us.
They can't hurt us.
Yeah.

We are safe.
Yeah.
No one can come between us.
Say it.
No one can come between us.
No one can come between us.
No one can come between us.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[Whispering] That's good.
That's good, baby.
Okay.

No one can come between us.
I like you, too.

Monty:

[Speaks Spanish]
You got to push harder.
I thought you wanted to be like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
I can't.

Come on, man, you were doing so well.
I got this friend ‭that's looking for bodybuilders for a performance piece he's doing next week in Miami at South Beach.
I was hoping to recommend you.
Yeah, I...

Come on.
It'll be great for your confidence.
You'll get out of town, hang out by the beach with some artsy folks, huh?
No...

No, no, no, no, ‭they can't touch you, Hammer.
Can't touch you.
- Yeah.

What... what's wrong?
Look at me.
Don't tell me you got some girl problems.
Hmm?
No, I'm mad.

I-I want to hurt someone.
No, no, no.

I drew a picture, ‭and I cut the eyeballs out.
Okay, that's a little too Ted Bundy.
Look, look, Dean, if someone has hurt you...

...you got to tell them what you're feeling inside.
Okay?

He would crush them.
No.

The governor never hit anyone.
He likes to talk it through.
Yeah, that's true.
The governor is... is a gentleman.
Yeah.

Look, you got to tell whoever this is, really, what you're feeling ‭in your mind and your soul.
You got to build your muscles.
You got to build your mind, too.
- Okay.

- Okay.

Okay, yeah.
Eliot Ness... untouchable.
Untouchable, baby.
Come on.
Pushing here, 150 pounds, my friend.
[Speaks Spanish]
I can't speak Spanish.
[Bell dings]
Hey, y'all.
- Hey, Pol.

Oh.
You don't look so good, pretty baby.
Rough night?
- Hey, Dean.

I thought you were working out with Monty.
Monty dropped me off.
I want to go see our old foster parents today.
[Coughs]
Wait a minute.

I want to see our old foster parents today.
I don't want to make up any more stories or sing Jeffrey Osborne.
Monty said I need to confront them.
Mnh-mnh, Dean, ‭that's not a good idea, okay?
I'm doing it.
You're either with me or you're against me.
Pick your fancy.
Dean.
Dean.
Let's talk about this.
No.
Dean, ‭what are you gonna do, just roll up on these people's open house and confront them?
Yes.

Dean, maybe we should go see the doctor and work this out.
No, I don't need to work this out.
I need to say what's on my mind.
Right.

I'm trying to protect you.
No, speaking the truth will only improve things.
And you can't protect me.
I'm not your child.
Dean, listen to me.
Get out of the car, Dean.
Let's go now.
[Sighs]
Wonderful.

Now, look at this.

Is that not beautiful?

No, I get to...

Oh, hi, welcome.
Come on in.

You love the open space?

Come inside, we're just finishing up here.
Dean:

You...

Is there something wrong with him?
Go ahead, Dean.
We at cat food.

I think you may need to take him out.
No.
Everything's all right.

You had us in bunk beds like the Middle Passage.
Who are you, sir?
We were your foster kids.
My Lord.

You made us shit in the backyard!
Man:

Oh, no, everything's fine.

It's okay.

Oh, my.
Little Butterball Desna and Ricky Retardo.
No wonder your poor crackhead mama left you with us.
Let me find out you're still keeping kids.
I'm gonna report your ass.
Hay, hay.

You think anyone's gonna believe you?
You'd be selling your ass on the corner if I hadn't taught you some sense.
You still doing coke, bitch?
[Sniffs] That's what rich people do.
Y'all are the ones who cook it.

He'd still be peeing in his pants if I hadn't beat him straight.
How you doing...
That's not...

You still think of me as Mrs. Meanie?
I should whoop your ass for what you did to us!
You tried to destroy us, but you didn't.
I helped you, just like we helped ‭all of those other children.
We have a commendation from the governor, dinner at Mar-A-Iago.
This state loves us.
Now get the hell out.
Come on, Des.

Don't touch my sister!
Don't touch...

[Panting]
Why does evil always win?
Dean, it doesn't, okay?
Look, I will protect you.

No, that's not true!
You don't protect me, I protected you.
What are you talking about?
Oh, no, no, don't tell her, Dean.
You can't tell her.
Dean, don't tell her.

- Don't tell me what, Dean?

Don't you...

Dean, you can tell me.
No, I can't tell you!
Their rules don't apply anymore, Dean, okay?
- You can tell me.

Dean, don't you tell her, Dean.
Don't...

They...

They told me if... if I said anything that they would do the same thing to you.

I'm sorry, Des.

Oh, no!
Des, I'm sorry!
Des, I'm sorry!

Not like this!

You...

This is Florida.

This is not how you do it.
I don't feel safe.
[Whispering] ‭They can't hurt you, Dean.
They already did, Desna.
I-I'll put bars on the house,
I'll get an alarm system, but I can't have a gun in this house, Dean.
I can't do it.
Dean, please.
Put the gun down.
Dean, put it down.
Please.
[Sighs]
[Whimpers]
[Sighs]
[Groans]
What's going on?
We're pinning Roller's murder on my foster parents.
Have you lost your mind?
They did unspeakable shit to my brother.
Dean's ass went out and bought a gun today.
A gun?
If I don't do this,
Dean is gonna settle it his damn self.
Wait, wait, wait, what?
We're gonna make them look like they're Roller's drug dealers, okay?
We're gonna plant coke and the rest of Roller's money in their house.
Whoa, whoa, Des, I don't think this is a good idea.
No.

They'll be in jail ‭for the rest of their lives, and then me and you are good.
Desna, I need that money.
So do I. But what I don't need is my brother running around shooting up my damn place.
Your foster parents?
Come on.
China doll, don't punk out on me now.
[Sighs] ‭All right, all right, all right, how are we gonna plant the money on them?
I don't know.

I mean, between the two of us, we got to know somebody who can do it.
I know someone who can do it.
Trust me.
They're good.
Oh, whoa.
There she is.
- Are you crazy?

Hell no, we can't...
What's going on, ‭Tweedledee and Tweedledum?
We're in a jam.
Wait, wait, wait.
We cannot let Polly help us with this.
- Why not?

Pol, you're wearing an ankle bracelet.
One false move ‭and you'll be back in Gaston sucking cheese ‭off some prison bitch's toes.
I'm not gonna be responsible for that.
Oh, all right, then.

Pol, you can't blackmail us into letting you help us.
I can try.

China doll here killed Roller!
Whoa, whoa.

Jesus.

Sugar, please.
Pol, that was after I tried to drown him.
You were in on this, too?

No, no, it was after he attacked me.
Oh, bless his heart.
I mean, that's terrible.
Polly, please, we really need your help to set up the Coombses for the murder.
- Mnh-mnh.

We cannot let this woman get in trouble on account of what we did.
I am not gonna get in trouble.

After everything that you've done for me?
You're like my sister, Des.
You got to let me help you.
Besides, I have a friend at the motel who has a tracking jammer.
I am gonna be fine.
But are you sure you want to do this?
Our foster parents ‭did horrible things to Dean.
- To Dean?

No.
[Voice breaking] They did stuff.
He wouldn't even tell me, stuff I can't even say.
No.
They need to be in jail.
They need to pay ‭for what they did to my brother.
[Sniffs] I can't let them do that to another child.
I just can't.
- Okay.

I just can't.

We did it!
[All scream]
[Sighs]
[Exhales deeply]
[Phone rings]
Operator: 911 operator.

Yeah, um, I want to report a murder.
Murder?
Yeah, uh, um, this guy named Roller Husser.
We was partying a few weeks back when his drug dealers came in and... they killed him.
Now, I ain't no snitch, but I felt like this was the right thing to do.
Yeah?

Try to get them little eyes to light up, but...
- Clay.

We just got a call.
We got a lead on Roller's killers.
Take care of it.
Done.
[Bell dings]
Hey, y'all.
Morning, babe.

I am hanging in there.
Nobody eat these.

- How's Dean?

- Desna.

All right, I have good news and interesting news.
The good news is that Mrs. Choi is willing to take a deposit today, and she's knocked $500 off the asking price.
My girl.
The interesting news...
The owner of Glint Nails has put it back on the market, and she's willing to play ball with you.
- Shut up.

So, the racist who didn't want to deal with my kind has now changed her tune?
This could be delicious.
It's $1,500 more a month.
I mean, I say play it safe.
I say I keep the promise I made to my brother.
And getting a salon is one step closer to doing that.
Desna, are you sure?
I'm not gonna settle, Mandy, and neither should you.
Now, I'm not one to speak on nobody's marriage.
But you deserve a hamburger every now and again.
- Desna...

We can't live our lives just for men.
Who does that?
We got to do some things for ourselves.
I'm trying to tell you.
I want you to take this.
- Mm-hmm.

I want you to swallow it.
[Laughs]
I promise.
You are good, Mandy.
You hear me?

Thank you.
Congrats.
[Screams]
[All cheering]
Put some music on, handsome.
Oh, my God.

Uncle Daddy:

Hey.

Yeah, things are just fine, Miss Desna.
- Is this a good time?

Well, Roller's killers have beautifully transitioned, thanks to some mercurial angels led by my handsome nephew, Bryce.
Are you saying that Roller's killers are dead?
Who...

Dirty mothers.
Ran some high-end real-estate office across the state, dealing drugs ‭out of every one of them.
Someone's conscience got the best of them and they tipped off the police.
Luckily, I got some cops on the tit, and they, uh, gave me a head start.
[Quietly] My God.
Listen, uh, I just...
I just wanted to say sorry if this investigation caused you any pain or hardship.
And give my regards to Virginia, as well.
My nephew used to say, "It's a new era, y'all."
- [Beeps]

Who found them?
Was it Bryce?

[Sobs]
Don't cry, baby, don't cry.
[Sobbing]
Don't cry.

[Crying] No!
No!

Dean.
Deanie, I...

I wish I had known back then.
They're not gonna be able to hurt you anymore.
Ho-How do you know?
I know.

I just know.
It's time to put all the... the pain behind us... the Coombses, Roller, all of it.
I need you to know ‭that we're safe now, baby.
- Yeah.

Mr. Emerson.
No, I'm Roller.
You're alive.
I need water.
Who are you?
I'm your bleeding heart of love, Mr. Emerson.
Oh, welcome to Tuscany.
[Singing continues]
