[THUNDER CRACKLES]
♪ Rain drops keep Falling on my head ♪
Okay.
No!

WOMAN:

That's a man rule, babe.
He was taunting me.
It's his job to taunt you!

So I am supposed to let a carnie, some nomadic fair worker question my manhood?
Oh, yes.

That's a very important job for a man.
That's very hard to do.
Oh, it's very hard?

Clearly, he was a ringer.

Hey, did I win you the bear, or did I win you the bear?
You got me the bear.

And I love it.

And I love you.

[LAUGHING]
I can't believe we're going home to our new house.
I can't believe you convinced me to go to a county fair.
Ha, ha.

[LOCAL ACCENT] We gotta get into our small town frame of mind.
[LOCAL ACCENT] Oh, you want to be like one of the locals?
[NORMAL ACCENT] I don't know about that.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
But I did want a good luck keepsake for the new house.
[NORMAL ACCENT] I thought your necklace was your good luck charm?
It's not exactly a good luck charm.
I'm sorry, your non-bad luck charm.
It's supposed to keep evil spirits away.
Well, it's clearly not working...
Yeah.
[LAUGHING]
I just want home to be perfect, full of love...
And...
The sound of children laughing...
Oh!

That is two hours and 15 minutes since our last baby mention.
You want to have a baby, too.
Correction.

What you do after that is entirely up to you.
Babe, I'm just looking to get laid.
Oh, okay.

Well... if you play your cards right...

My teddy-bear-winning He-Man... you just might.
Maybe we can start trying tonight.
[SCREAMING]
[GASPS] Hey, Megan!
[KEYS JINGLING]
Babe!
Babe!

Did you see her?

The girl!

I swear to God I saw somebody in the road!
Okay, it was likely an animal, babe.

Something.
Come on, get back in the car, it's freezing out here!
MEGAN:

Of course I believe you.

You old kook!
[TIRES SLIDING]
And... we are stuck.
Are you sure?
Yeah, pretty sure.
All right, the way I see it, we got two options.
We can call a tow truck and wait, which, out here can take all night.
Or...
Or what?

Through the mud and rain?
Yeah, the house is a quarter mile away...
I'll make you a deal.

If you can catch it, you can have it.
[SCREAMING AND LAUGHING]
[♪♪]
MAN:

Yeah, but I'm all yours, baby!
[LAUGHING]
You gonna get me?

[LAUGHING AND SCREAMING]
[PANTING]
I still beat you.

[♪♪]
What was that for?
I was claiming my prize.

[MEGAN LAUGHING]
[RAIN POURING]
[GASPING]
[FRYING PAN SCRAPING]
Hey, babe.
There's my sleeping beauty.
[CHUCKLES]
Please, I feel I haven't slept a wink.
Well, the clock on the wall says otherwise.
1:15?

Yeah, I thought about making you lunch, and then I figured... you gotta have your first breakfast in your new house, right?

Thank you, sir.

Heh.
Sorry I slept so late.
Mm, I guess I just wore you out.
Yeah, you did.
[CHUCKLES]
[RAIN POURING]
Honey!

[GRUNTING]
What the hell was that?
[BOTH PANTING]
None of this is working now.
What do you think happened?
The perils of a new house.
Ah, ha.

Uh, for now, crisis averted.
Is it safe?

I gotta unpack my tools.

[RAIN POURING]
How's it going in here?
Remind me, again, why I have so many books.
Because you're a writer.

Yeah.
What's this trashy novel?
At least the author is hot.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
Trashy novel?
Andrew!

ANDREW:

Seriously.

What?
I didn't realize you did so much unpacking in here.
I didn't.
You didn't do this?
Movers.
I suppose.

Did you see those guys?
Weird is an understatement.
I hope they didn't break anything.
Think about it like this... less time for unpacking and more time for playing.
Oh, we got a leak.
But it's your dream house.
[LAUGHING]
Fixer-upper.

Go fix it up!
[WIND BLOWING AND RAIN POURING]
I can't believe we have a guest room.
Hopefully it won't be a guest room for very long.
Oh?

Maybe a nursery?
Mmm, talk about feeling like a grown up.
Picture it with me, okay?
We could... put a changing table right here...
Uh-huh.

Have a rocking chair in the corner by the window, and the crib could go right there on that wall.
The crib!

That kid is gonna be in our bed every night.
[GASPS] I love our house.
Just be with me.
I'm so happy here.
I never, ever want to leave this place.
Then here we shall stay.
So, this is the nursery, but down the hall the second bedroom could be for baby number two.
Whoa, let's uh, slow down.

We should build a tree house in the backyard.
Or maybe even put in a pool.
Well, not till they get older.
And the attic will be a perfect playroom.
And we could even put a big screen TV up there, couches...
I see your mouth moving, right?

We'll be okay!
You'll keep writing books.
And I'll keep painting.
And we'll live happily ever after.
I like that.
But first... we unpack.
Go!
[RAIN POURING]
[THUNDER CRACKLING]
[SCREAMS]
What is it?

There's someone out there.
In the yard?
No!

Baby, it's the storm playing tricks on you.
I saw her.
No, come here, we are on the second floor.
Come here.
It's a straight drop, two stories, it's impossible.
See?
It's a reflection.
Yeah, it makes sense.
Oh, were you scared?
We should get blinds.
Your wish is my command.
[VOICE WHISPERING]
VOICE:

Get out.
Get out!
[♪♪]
[THUNDER CRACKLING]
Oh, my God.
[LAUGHING]
Aw.

Mrs. Pinkleton.
[♪♪]
Hard at work, I see.
Those are the boxes your mother sent?
Yeah.
Have you met Mrs. Pinkleton?

Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Pinkleton.
[LAUGHING]
Have you ladies had lunch?
No, we haven't.
Hmm, well, are you hungry?

I'm not really hungry right now.
I think I just wanna go through these boxes a little bit longer.
Okay!

See you down there?

Hello?
Someone out there?
Babe!
Babe!

I thought I saw someone out there.
In the rain?
Over there.

I thought I saw two people.
Well, I don't know what they'd be doing in this weather.
Come on, let's dry off.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[♪♪]
It's good you're such a good dancer.
I was a little bit worried at that karaoke bar we met at.
Hey!

I only told you that so I could get into your pants.
Girl, you could have said I sounded like a cat being skinned alive and still got in my pants.
You're so easy.
[LAUGHING]
This is nice.
Yeah.
I love you.
I love you.
And I love how happy you are.
I am.
Maybe we should go to bed?
Yeah, we should.
Let me just take the trash out.
Oh, baby!

It can wait.

That's what all the little mice are saying, too.
Mice?
We have mice?
We will if we don't take the trash out.
Go on, go on up.
I'll meet you up there.
[MEGAN LAUGHS]
[WIND BLOWING AND THUNDER CRACKLING]
Andrew!
Andrew!
Hold on!

I'm just trapped.
You okay?

You all right?
Thank God you're here.
[ANDREW LAUGHING]
Can't lose that.
Ow.
I could have been killed.

I don't even want to think about it.
If you hadn't shown up.
But I did.
Yes, you did.
My knight in shining armor.
Hey!

I don't know.

Was it near a light bulb or an outlet?
I don't think so.
It just...

I mean, I couldn't see everything.
You were scared.
Well, it doesn't matter now.
And with this rain...
I don't think we are gonna have to worry about fire, ever again!
[BOTH LAUGHING]
Yeah, that's cold.
[LAUGHING]
Andrew!
Andrew, you up here?
Hello?
[WIND BLOWING]
[VOICE WHISPERING]
Aah!
ANDREW:

Hey, babe?
Yeah.

Okay, almost there...
Step, little baby step.

Are you ready?
Ta-da!
My studio.

And it's now ready to be graced by your extraordinary talents.
You don't like it?
Look, if I put anything in the wrong place, I can move it, right?
Just, uh...
Do you want the easel by the window?

No, no.

I really do.
I, uh...
I think the fire threw me for a loop.
I can imagine.

You're so good to me!
Well, I am quite the catch.
Here, sit down.
Come on!
I have paint back here,
I got your paint brushes in this can that you love so much,
I unpacked your canvases, you're ready to go.
Andrew!

Baby!
Oh, uh...

Oh, uh, no, it's nothing.
I just...

It's...

I gotta get something to wrap that up with!
No.

Okay.
Please don't leave me.
Of course.
Hey!

Help me get set up.
Hey!

'Cause I'd be happy to pose nude for you.
Thank you so much.
This means the world to me.
You deserve it.
Now paint me a masterpiece so we can afford this house.
[RAIN POURING AND THUNDER RUMBLING]
Can't work?
No...
I'm not feeling very inspired.
Well...

My head is killing me.

How about your arm?

I had forgotten all about it.
I might go lay down for awhile.
You want some company?
My head is pounding, hon.
Are you really gonna use the "I have a headache" excuse on me?
For the record, I told you about my headache first.
I'll be upstairs.
[SIGHING]
[VOICE GROWLING]

Come on.
Bulbs?

[SHATTERS] [GRUNTS]
Fuck.

[VOICE WHISPERING]
Andrew.
Hey, babe.

Have you seen my necklace?
It's the one I always wear.

Did you take it off when you were cleaning?
No!

You check the bathroom?
I checked everywhere, okay?

Okay.

No!

This is important!
Hey, I will help you find your necklace.
Okay?
It doesn't make any sense.

I looked everywhere.
I know.
You've been running around the last couple days, it probably snapped off somewhere.
It's here.

Okay?

We have to.
I know.
I need it!

We need it.
You feel a little warm.
First, I find you some aspirin... then we find your necklace, okay?
[VOICES WHISPERING]
[SCREAMING]
Out!
What happened?
Someone is out there.
A woman, an elderly woman... she was right there.
Hello?
Hey, who's out there?
Hello?
I'm not crazy, Andrew.
I didn't say that.
But look, when I was out there...
I thought, uh...
I don't know what I thought, but I didn't think angel statue.
Right?
It's this storm, babe, it's playing tricks on you.
Baby, your arm.
I need my necklace.
Okay, we'll find it.
We have to.
Do you understand me?
I understand you, yes.
We'll find your necklace.

MEGAN:

Andrew?
Andrew!
Andrew, wake up!
Andrew!

Wake up!
[SCREAMING]
What?

[CRYING]
Okay.
Easy, easy, easy...
Okay.
It's okay.
It's all right.

[THUNDER RUMBLES]
MEGAN:

I just gotta get out of bed for a minute.
Please.
Don't leave me.
I don't want to be alone.
Okay.
It's still raining.
What's happening, Andrew?
ANDREW:

I don't know.
Am I losing my mind?

I keep seeing these...
What?
I feel...
What?
It sounds stupid.

Maybe this house is haunted.
I know, I sound like...

Well, you read those books.
Paranormal stuff.
And they're just books.
Babe, you're not feeling well, you're tired, you know?
Please, don't patronize me.
I'm not patronizing you.

There's always an explanation.
I'm just saying, there's an explanation.
What if there's not an explanation?
What if this is the explanation?
Okay, what do you want to do?
I don't know.
Maybe it is all in my head.
Do you wanna go?

What?

This is our house.

I'm not leaving.
Okay.
I need to find my necklace.
Babe.
[CREEPY ECHOING] [DOOR SLAMS]
Hello?
[SCREAMING]
VOICE:

Get out.
[CRYING]
It's not much.
But until we can get a tow truck out here, we are short on supplies.
It's okay.
I'm not hungry anyway.
Baby, you're burning up.
You gotta eat something.
Then go upstairs and take a nap.
Come on.

Baby, you have to eat.
I know you don't believe me, Andrew.
I don't know if I believe me.
But it's real.
I'm not going crazy.
Baby, no one is saying you are going crazy.
No one is saying that.
But you're sick, you're fatigued, and this damn storm...
I'm thinking maybe we should get out of here for a while.
No.
Just for a while, we'll call a cab.
There are no cabs around here.
Well then we'll get a car, babe.

The point is...

This is our house... we have worked too hard for this...
I'm not walking away.
It could just be for a little while.
I'm not leaving!

Okay.
We'll stay, I promise.

I thought you were gonna take a nap?
What's that?
Do you remember when I told you about those things I used to see?
Yeah, with your grandpa?
Yeah, Shadow People.
That's what I would call them.
I could barely make them out but...
I knew that they were there.
And you think that's what this is?
I remember drawing this.
I was at my grandpa's house.
That's when I first starting seeing them.
He could see them, too.
He told me that they were coming for him.
To take him away to the other side.
Like the Grim Reaper?
Except they weren't there to guide you.
They came to take you.
Jesus.
He told all this to a little girl?
He knew that I could see them, too.
He wanted to protect me.
But it wasn't me that they wanted.
I thought your grandfather died of a heart attack.
Yeah, he did.
But he knew that they were coming for him.
He said he could see them.
Could see faces.
You can't fight them.
I don't know, this all sounds like, uh... ghost story talk.
I could see them.
And other people couldn't.
Just like now.
Maybe your...
Maybe your imagination is getting the best of you.
It's an old rickety house...
No.
I think that they're back.
And I think they're here.
Okay.
If there are Shadow People here, they can't hurt you, right?
I mean, not if you don't let them.
Isn't that how it works?

I mean, they are...

You just...

It doesn't work that way.
Do you understand?

Okay.
Why don't we get you downstairs, get you in a bath, get some food in you, put you down for a nap?
I know you think this is all in my head, but it's not.

Come on.

Let go of me!

I'm not leaving!

No!

Let go!

Leave me alone!

I'm not leaving!

Do you understand?

This is my house!

I won't!
You don't have to.

You don't have to go.
I don't want to go.
Okay, put it down, let's go back inside.
[CRYING] Don't make me...
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
What's happening to me?

You're okay.

You're all right.

Hey.

I'm here.

I got you...

Might make you feel better.

Megan!

Hey!

Megan!

Andrew?
Are you okay?
Am I okay?

We gotta get out of here.

I'm not gonna sit here...

And watch this house, we're leaving!
[DEMONIC VOICE] I am not leaving this house!
Megan you're hurting my arm, stop.
Babe you're hurting my arm.

So that's all you remember?
Yeah.

I'm just glad you're okay.
I can't believe I blacked out in the bath tub.
You don't remember anything from before?
I remember the woman in the backyard, the man in the shower.
I remember that I love you.
You're my everything.
I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
How about this?
Let's never find out.
[ANDREW LAUGHS]
[SNIFFLES]
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
Andrew!

What?
I don't come in here and mess around all of your stuff!
Why would you even do that?
What?

You moved everything around in there, and that is my room!
I don't understand, calm down.

Oh.
Babe, I didn't touch your stuff, I swear.
You moved my paints!
I've been here, in this room, the entire time.
Are you serious?
Baby...
No.

What happened?
See, it's...
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
Come on!

Sir, this is private property, I need you to leave!
Hey, I called the Sheriff, he is on his way, man!
There's no use!
I'm asking you nicely, get the fuck off my property!
No sense in fighting it.
Everybody dies.
It's just your time.
It's your time.
[EVIL LAUGHING]
Who is that guy?

I'm scared, Andrew.
It's okay.

Where did he go?
The roads are flooded.

I don't know, babe.
And what was he talking about?
It's a bunch of gibberish.

He said it was my time to die.
Baby, he is clearly crazy.
Is that your answer to everything?
Maybe he knows something.
All right.

There was somebody in our house!
Whoa!

You all right?
I just got dizzy.
All right, well, sit down.

Your nose.
Babe, Megan, hey!
Megan!
Babe!

Megan, wake up!
Ma'am?

Just hang on a bit.
Help's coming.

[EVIL LAUGHING]
[GASPING]
That man?

And the Sheriff?
He came by, looked around and he, uh, couldn't find anything.
He did get our car unstuck, though.
He just looked around?
Babe, if that guy was still here, the Sheriff's car would have spooked him off.
Ah, baby, you're burning up.
I feel like it.
Listen, I know you're probably sick of hearing it but... we should get you to a doctor.
Let's just get you out of here for a little while.
You know I'm right!
You want to leave our house?
No.

Do you think it's...?
Haunted?

I don't know.
It's probably fumes or something, all right?
Carbon monoxide...
With all this construction, who knows what you've been breathing in.
Well, you seem all right.
Maybe it's an allergic reaction, I don't know.
Something.
Maybe...

Maybe I am losing it.

Listen, you're not losing it, you got a high fever and you need a doctor.
Right?

This house has some kind of hold on you.
I don't know what's going on, but you got to let it go.
I'm gonna get a rag to cool you off and get out of here.

If you're not feeling better by tomorrow, babe, we'll take you to town and maybe get you some meds!
And me, a bottle of something strong.
