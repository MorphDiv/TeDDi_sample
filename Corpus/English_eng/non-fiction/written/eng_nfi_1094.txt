Ten years ago, the animal population mutated, endangering human life on the planet.
Our team managed to cure the animals, but at a terrible cost.
In an attempt to return the planet to the animals, a secretive group called the Shepherds released a gas that sterilized all of humanity.
And then lab-made creatures called hybrids devastated the West coast.
So a massive barrier was constructed, to protect the rest of North America, but new breeds have started to appear, so we reassembled our team.
We battle on many fronts, searching for a cure to sterility while racing to stop the hybrids and a brutal terrorist with a plan to end the human race.
The fight for mankind's survival has just begun.
Previously on Zoo...
I want what you want...

I ID'd the bomber.
Her name is Abigail Westbrook.
Jackson, she's your sister.
My father's alive, and he needs you, Jamie.
Nice beard.
If we don't find a way to stop the hybrids, the entire world is gonna wind up like Portland.
We'll let Dr. Kenyatta handle it.
Jackson sent you this.
- What is that?

The razorbacks have come for it.
Daddy?
No!
I'm okay.
- Dariela.

- Does Abe know you're calling?

But I have some research you need to see.
I think Abe is onto something.
My name is Leanne Ducovny.
Your child has been selected to participate in our pilot program.
Isaac!
Isaac!
911.

My child's been taken.
Ma'am?
Listen to me.

National Guard Regiment out of Fort Dolostone.
The convoy that took them had been diverted by the snowstorm, but we found them.

Calm down.

We're getting a lot of calls about this.
Do you have Internet access?
What are you talking about?
There you'll be able to read
Presidential Executive Order 14725, and hopefully you can...
Are you serious?
You're reading from a script right now?
Abe?
Hey, stop!
Move.

Male approaching.
Back in your vehicle.
- Now.

- Isaac?

- Isaac!

Isaac!

Trucks are covered.
- Move 'em out.

- You can't do this!

I'm not gonna ask again.
You're going to shoot me?
For trying to get to my son?
Do not take another step!
- Stand down.

Daddy!
You are soldiers!

No, and unless something changes, I never will.
Now... back... off...

I am going to follow my son.
- Daddy!

We have orders to use deadly force if you don't comply.
Let's get this convoy going, soldiers.
Daddy!
Isaac?
Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan, where the Federal government authorized Reiden Global to quarantine children under 12.
Reiden Global CEO Leanne Ducovny defended the action, comparing it to this country's own history of a military draft as a civic duty.
In other news, investigators have linked a deadly explosion at an NYPD precinct to a similar tragedy at a refugee camp in Portland.
Authorities are searching for this woman, Abigail Westbrook, a person of interest in the investigation.
Who also happens to be my sister.
Wanted on 23 counts, from impersonating a federal agent to using weapons of mass destruction.

Any luck tracing that phone call she made to me?
No.
She's very good at covering her tracks.
Do we know anything else?
Like how she's connected to the hybrids?
You can ask Abigail yourself when we arrest her.
Who's Abigail?
The person who attacked our camp.
Logan ID'd her.
- Her name's Abigail Westbrook.

He didn't get much else.
Any idea where she is?
'Cause I need to hit something.
Preferably one Abigail Westbrook.
I plastered her photo at airports, train stations and the border.

You guys know this area better than anybody, so, the moment that we do get a hit on her, I'm hoping that you'll come with...
Dylan, you okay?
Dylan, you okay?
Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
I should just tell her the truth, but how can I explain it to her if I can't make sense of it myself?
Dad, I know people can't have kids anymore, but... guess what?
I'm pregnant.

I know you've only been awake for a couple days, but...
I'm bearing child.
Bearing child?
Dad,
I'm having a baby.
You got this.
So... let me just... recap.
Jackson's gone into hiding, and you have no idea where he is?
I haven't seen him in years.
And Logan, that beacon of truth and justice, is a Cop?
- Yeah.

Like, a doctor doctor?
Any soul-rattling news you'd like to share?
Now's probably not the best time.
So there's no team, just us against a rapidly-growing horde of vicious hybrids that are barely being contained by a barrier?
Oh, and all of humanity is sterile.
You've been in a tank for ten years.
A few things have changed.
So it appears.
You wrote a book, and you're now absurdly rich.
And I'm famous.
So, what, you grew up in her fancy penthouse?
Till I went to go live with Grandpa.
Grandpa?
Let me ask you something.
When you were leaving Pangaea, and I was getting gored to death by razorbacks, did Abe perchance relay a message to you?
- To look after Clem.

To look after Clem, which is something
I couldn't have done on account of me dying to save the world.
You know, that old chestnut.
You, of all people, should know that Grandpa is quite literally the last person on earth I would want raising her.
Well, Grandpa came to her 14th birthday party, and the next day, I was served with a summons.
He was seeking custody, and seeing as I'm not a blood relative, there wasn't a whole lot I could do.
Well.

Just put me back in the tank.
Back in the tank.
Back in the... back in the...
Back... back... back...
- Dad?

- Mitch?

Dad?
Back in the tank...
Back in the tank.
Dariela?
- Jonah?

Where's Abraham?

What are you doing here?
This is my fault.

Abraham's research was a true breakthrough, and could help Reiden with a...
W-W-Wait, Jonah.

You think that's why they took the kids?
What are you doing here?
Wh...

Th-This is not what you think.
What are you doing here, Jonah?
Don't you make me ask you a third time.
Look, I came here to help you.
Okay?
Abe?
- Abe!

To help?

What kind of help could I want from the man who slept with my wife?

- Abraham, stop it!

That you would never see him again.
He's here about Isaac!

I had no idea what Reiden would do with your research...
That they would take children because of what it contained.
How did Reiden get their hands on my research?
I thought it would help us, Abe.
So I gave it to him.
I'm so sorry.
And I gave it to Reiden.
I'm sorry.
This isn't a stroke, but it is brain-related.
I can talk for now, but we've got to move quickly, because the brain works like a pinball machine.
If one area gets stimulated, if affects another.
Blue, and those are red, right?
We need to get you to a hospital.
Can you just answer my question, please?

- and blue, yes?

I think there's pressure on the speech center of my brain, and I've got to find out what's causing it.
- We got to get in there.

I mean... get in there.
Let's do it.
Are you really gonna perform brain surgery with that?
Are you nuts?
That is exactly what we need.
Why are you here?
To absolve yourself for this?
- Let me help you get Isaac back.

Give me his Social Security number and his date of birth.
My cousin works for Reiden.
She may be able to track him down, get him out.
We'll send it to your phone.
I'll call you, soon as I know something.
I feel like I could die.
I deserve to.
Is your arm okay?
There has to be something we can do.
Maybe you could talk to Reiden.
And say what?
I don't know.
If I had something useful to show them, then...
That new hybrid sample.
The other night, you said it was the key to solving sterility.
The sample's gone.
Unless...
Hey.

What's going on?
Yes.

No.
Uh, sorry, I can't.
The hybrid was destroyed in an explosion.
Oh, God.
What's this about?
I don't know if you've seen the news, but Reiden has taken children.
Isaac is one of them, I'm trying to get him back.
I saw that.
I was hoping that Isaac wasn't one of them.
- I'll be there as soon as I can.

But what you can do is get me another one of those hybrids.
It's stem cells may stimulate reproduction.
If I can get another sample, it may help solve the sterilization problem.
And Reiden would have to let my son go.
If this new hybrid is the key to solving humanity's sterility problem and can save Isaac, then, Abe,
I will do whatever it takes to hunt one down.
Thank you, rafiki.
This new hybrid is not like the razorbacks.
It is something new.
They seem to communicate interspecies at 32 kilohertz.
We may be able to track them using this frequency.
Great.

All right?

We are gonna get Isaac back.
Abe's son is in trouble.
And he needs our help.
So we need to hunt a hybrid.
Your long-lost baby sister murdered 200 people and counting.
We need to be hunting her.
Look, if I could do this myself, trust me, I would, but I need your chopper, and you need my tracking skills, so first, we hunt the new hybrid.
I don't care about your new hybrid.
I care about Jose Mendoza, my T.O. who died in my arms.
- Not only is this to help Abe's kid...

- that their father wasn't coming home.

Hey, what's going on?
We get a lead on Abigail?
Change of plans.
Okay.

Just until the skull pops.

Do not... drill too far.
Until the skull pops.

"Got it," like this is no big deal.
Hey.
Come here.
This is gonna be fine.
Okay?
Tell you what.
When it's all over, since you're an adult now, we'll go have a beer.
I already had my first beer when I was 14.
Not a fan.
Max gave you a beer?

It wasn't Grandpa.
Oh.
You gave a 14-year-old a b...
A b...
We need to do this now.
Leanne.
Leanne Ducovny.
Where are the children going?
Leanne, over here.
Let me help you with that.
Abe.
After you had the affair,
I couldn't look at you.
Every time I tried, all I saw was betrayal.
So I started to focus on Isaac, tried to see you through our boy's eyes.
As a mother.
A good mother.
That got me through.
But now, Isaac is gone.
I don't know how to look at you anymore.
You're gonna have to try.
Abe.
Abe.
Let me help you.
Of course, I am not without blame.
If I had not left to help Jackson that summer, you would not have turned to Jonah.
I know that much.
But the choices you made, what that did to us... and Isaac.
Yes?
I understand.
His cousin found Isaac.
They're arranging a transfer.
To the left.
Little bit, to, to the left.
Your other left.
Right there.
What is that?
Mitch, say something.
Whatever that is, it looks artificial.
Well, then, let's get it out.
No.
It's a live current.
We don't know what kind of brain damage will occur if we extract it.
Okay, what do we do?
Land the plane, and I need you to get me four items.
Car battery, some commercial-grade Velcro, some lollipops and a pig.
Pig, is that, like, an acronym for something?
Like, a pig.
A pig pig?
Yes, a pig.
Oh, any particular kind?
Any kind you can get your hands on.
Who is this?
What's going on?
Says he's Isaac Kenyatta.
I don't care what thing says.

Must be a mix-up.
What the hell does that even mean?
There must be some kind of explanation.
Where is Isaac?
Where is my son?
Don't ask.
Structure of a pig's brain is similar to a human's.
So by connecting it to mine, we can flash the device.
Make it safe for removal.
So I kind of understand all this other stuff, but why the lollipops?
Oh, those are for me.

Let me go get some sedatives.
When I was 14,
Jamie overheard me talking to a friend on the phone about having a keg party in the forest.
She offered to host it instead.
Said she'd rather have us drink where she could keep an eye on us.
Jamie did an amazing job raising me.
And so did Logan.
Logan?
And Grandpa after that.
I'm not sure which part of this story I hate more.
You know, growing up, I never realized how much of a pain in the ass you were.
Everyone did the best they could.
Everyone knew what I preferred, and they did exactly none of it.
Mom died, and in the same month, so did you.
I was 12 and alone.
You don't get a say in how I was raised.
I recalibrated the GPS to track the frequency Abe gave me.
I've got an IADG surveillance satellite here.
What am I looking for?
Thermal imaging.

As in, part prehistoric?
Hmm, as in "woolly rhino."
It's like that saber-toothed cat, huh?
If they're anything like regular rhinos, they'll sleep under thick brush.
So let's start there.
Never knew something so big could be a needle in a haystack.
Hey.

I'm not seeing any heat signatures.
Maybe it's cold-blooded.
If it's asleep, it'd have roughly the same temperature as the ground.
It should be right in front of us.
Earthquake?
That's not a woolly rhino.
You're going to be okay.
The boy's name is Gus Miller.
How did this happen?
All I know is some lady in Admin paid me to get this kid here.
It's gonna be okay.
Can you tell us about that place you were in?
It was big... like a cafeteria.
But cold.
We couldn't talk.
Not even whisper to the other kids.
A girl cried.
They took her away.
I didn't cry.
This is Isaac.
Did you see him?
He said his parents would rescue us.
No one believed him, but I guess he was right.
I got to get him back.
He's not going back.
He's not your kid.
He's not yours, either.
And he's not the property of Reiden.
We're going to take him back to his parents.
It's okay, come on.
Connect the cables to the battery.
It'll engage.
That's not good.
The current just exposed it.
That's a bio-drive.
It's a what?
It's Shepherd technology.
I put the guy who created it behind bars.
Okay.

Any tech that they created is dangerous.
We need to know exactly what it does before we get it out of you.
And I know who to ask.
Where... where are you going?
Who are you gonna talk to?
You know I can't go with you, right?
Still strapped in here.

I got this.
Get in the truck!
What's next?

- Go!

That was close.
Whoa!

Come on.
- Hold onto something!

Truck's going over the edge of the cliff.
Dylan?

Guys!
Come on!
Mommy?

Gus!
Oh...
Hi there.
This is a bio-drive your Shepherd scientists created.
What does it do?
Give me 15 minutes alone with that blonde girl and I'll tell you.
Do you want to do this the hard way?
I need access to a Shepherd server.
Give me the password.
It's a call/response system.
If you want to know what that bio-drive does, you need to take me up there.
Since we already had its IADG satellite in position,
I used it to track the hybrid's flight path.
How's your Spanish?
Flew to Mexico?

Can you pull up past imagery?
Yeah.

What are you looking for?
Just focus in right there.
Keep going back in.

Okay, right there, stop.
Can you push in on that?
That's Abigail.
In the last decade, all we have seen is razorback hybrids.
Now two new species pop up in the span of 48 hours?
Something's happening, and Abigail is at the center of it.
I'm gonna prep the chopper.
I'll get Tessa.
Jackson... we both know what Abigail's capable of.
If Tessa's gonna risk her life with us, she deserves to know the facts, all of them.
Thanks for inviting me to the weirdest party ever.
Who is that?

Mansdale.

What the hell is Mansdale doing here?
Not now, Mitch.
Find out what the bio-drive does.
If you send a distress signal, you know what happens.
Did I wake up in a parallel universe?
Is he your prisoner?
Clem is upset.
You died thinking that you were leaving her in a world full of hope, but that's not what happened.
She grew up surrounded by fear and bleakness, and you're hung up on when she had her first beer?
Am I supposed to not have an opinion about what went wrong?
Everything went wrong.
The world went wrong, and she turned out okay.
Got something.
What?
"BioDrive 1142."
It was designed to network human thoughts into a collective consciousness.
It was a failure.
Why was is a failure?
Release me and I'll tell you.
Jamie, what the...
Not now, Mitch.
That missed your MP joint.

Why was it a failure?
All of the test subjects who had the bio-drive put in died after three months.
Three months?

I was in that tank for ten years.
Then you don't know your own expiration date.
Sucks for you.
Why would the Shepherds put the bio-drive in him?
We didn't, all right?

The program, it was shut down 13 years ago.
Okay.

The Shepherds that pulled me out of the tank, they kept asking me about it.
"Blue Diaspora" that was, uh, the name of the project that created the hybrids.
All right?

I swear.

I have no idea how that thing got inside you.
Why would they ask you about Blue Diaspora?
I don't know.
But it's probably why this thing is still in my head.
Okay, buckle up tight.
How'd this all happen?
A corporation taking children from their own homes?
With the help of the U.S. military.
We're so sorry about Isaac.
What you two did for us, it's-it's beyond words.
We're just glad Gus is home safe.
Is there anything we can do to to repay you, to help you?
Just keep Gus safe, and leave town immediately.
Head east while the military protocol isn't in effect.
We'll find another way to get Isaac back.
What's this?
Mom?
Get out of the car!

Let's go, let's go!
- Come on, get out.

Go, go, go.
It's gonna be okay, Gus.
Honey, I'm right here, I'm right behind you.
I feel like shooting our way into the facility and getting him out.
Not a bad idea.
I wasn't being serious.
We don't have the manpower.

We can't be coming up with reasons not to do something.
Don't you think we've had enough reckless actions in this household to last ten lifetimes?
- Abe...

Stand down, stand down.
Target acquired.
Clear.
Sorry for the intrusion, Mr. and Mrs. Kenyatta.
I'm Leanne Ducovny.
We should talk.
Hey, there's something I need to tell you.
About time.

You've been conspiring with Detective Trench Coat since he got here.
Talk to me.
My name... is not...

It's...

That's not funny.
Okay.
This is Jackson Oz.
You are not Jackson Oz.
No, it's not.
A friend of mine created a virus that poisoned every search engine.
When you look for a photo of me, it's replaced by that doctored image.
I am so sorry.
- I didn't meant for...

Tessa, please.
I didn't help my father.
I tried to stop him.
But nobody wants to believe that, okay?
Especially the Shepherd hunters, they nearly caught me, killed me numerous times, so I came west, changed my name, kept moving, and then I met you.
I know this is hard to believe, but I promise you, the man that you've spent the last three years with, that's who I really am, okay?
You didn't just... make me forget about my past, you made me see a future.
A future with you.
Why are you telling me this right now?
We're about to go to Mexico to find Abigail and those hybrids.
Because...
Abigail Westbrook... is my sister.
I didn't even know I had a sister.
You know, I couldn't stop my father, but maybe I can stop her.
And I need you.
I need you with me.
I can't do this without you.
Okay?

I need you.
You said what we had was real, but it was built on a lie.
Not a little white lie, a pretty damn huge one.
Tessa!
Good-bye, Jackson.
Do you even know what you're apologizing for?
I can't help it if I woke up after ten years in not the greatest mood.
Listening to all those childhood moments you had with Jamie, my dad,
Logan... it's hard.
But why?
That doesn't make any sense.
So my life wasn't all doom and gloom.
Why are you upset about that?
Because if your life was so great, then you never really needed me.
I died, and life moved on without me.
And then I woke up.
There's no baseline for that.
My life was not great.
I was an orphan.
It got lonely and sad, but you know what got me through my darkest days?
Knowing that my dad was Mitch Morgan, the hero that sacrificed himself to save the world.
You have to get out of this room now.
What?
That induction ammeter... it'll spike if I get too emotional, so... get out.
Get out.
Mitch, I went over the data.
Every BioDrive that was left in ended in death.
The ones that they pulled out caused total memory loss.
So if we remove it, you'll forget me, Jamie... everything.
And if we leave it in... it'll kill me.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Dr. Kenyatta.
What is this about?
Earlier today,
I received a call from one of my department heads.
Well, it turns out that one of our couriers had quite a story.
Being paid to sneak a child out of our facility, a boy... named Isaac Kenyatta.
Well, this courier was quite rattled after you took Gus Miller from him.
Which you had no legal right to do, I may add.
You had no legal right to take our son.
We returned Gus to his parents.
- What did you do to them?

The Millers are fine.
But when I heard the name Kenyatta,
I recognized it.
I've seen your research, it's quite impressive.
And despite what you might think,
I am not completely heartless.
So I'm here to offer you a deal.
I can get Isaac back.
Here.
Look.
Daddy!

I will give you all the research you need in return for my son.
Let's talk about Clementine Lewis.
What does Clementine have anything to do with this?
Well, she's very special.
A girl that you may think you know, but she's a liar and a thief.
She stole intellectual property and I need it back.
It's that simple, you want Isaac, you bring me Clementine Lewis.
I took the schematics that Mansdale got and put the bio-drive in sleep mode, so... it won't transmit anything.
I'm leaving it in.
But you'll die.
Well, it's that, or I'll live with no memories.
No thank you.
I've already missed too much.
I don't want to lose anything else.
I promise you, we will find a way out of this.
We'll find out who did this and we'll get this thing out of my head, but for right now, it stays.
Just patch me up.
Okay, so, um... tell me about everything that I missed.
Graduation...
Oh, God, please tell you did graduate high school at least, didn't you?
You had something that you wanted to say earlier.
What... what was that?
Um...
Dad, I know you've only been awake a couple of days, but...
I just wanted to tell you that I love you.
I'm really happy you're back.
Me, too.
All right.
Let's get you out of this.
Mitch?
Mitch?
Mitch?
You just blacked out.
I know where I was when they put the bio-drive in my head.
We have to go there.
All right, I'll prep for takeoff.
The hybrids aren't here.
Abigail might be.
Okay, move in.
Yeah.
Mitch?
Jackson?
You're alive?
Uh... yeah.
How are you here right now?
I don't know.
I mean, I-I know this place, but I've never been here before, and now you're here, and...
Okay, and you.
Jackson?
Clementine?
Logan?
Well, this is more than a little weird.
How are you all here?
What is that thing?
This disc, this is the exact same one that the woman we're hunting left behind in Portland.
Hello?
Don't you just love a family reunion?
Maybe we'll have one one day.
Listen to me, I want you to understand something,
I am going to find you and I'm gonna stop you.
Do you get that?
You should stop worrying about me, Jackson.
Start worrying about yourself.
And that thing just started moving.
Hey!

Guys.
Abigail's bringing the hybrids here to our location.
I think they're about to move under us!
And then what?
