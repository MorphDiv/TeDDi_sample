- Hey, fella.
Thanks for your service.
- circa the battle of gettysburg.
- Perfect backup weapon for you, Dawson.
.41 caliber stops your average sumo wrestler in his tracks.
Tucks neatly in a Fanny pack.
I'd like to turn in a gun.
Yeah, let's take a look.
Two tours.
I'm glad that's over, man.
I was sweating' bullets walking around with that thing.
I mean, if I got stopped, you know?
It'd have been real bad.
- I still get the money even though it's broke?
My nephew wants a clarinet for his birthday.
I figured this would cover a used one.
- you have to come with us.
- Why, what'd I do?
- You see the dots?
That's blood spatter.
- What?
- I'm pretty sure your gun has a body on it.
Oh, shoot.
- The radio said bring any gun to the church today and get $100.
- All true, Mr. Williams, but your gun has dried blood on it, and-  it's not my gun.
- Whose gun is it?
- Where?
Well...
I was waiting for the bus early this morning, and I...
I threw away some chewing gum, and it was laying right-- right there in a-- a trash barrel.
- Your heart seems to be in the right place, Mr. Williams, but this story, to be honest, sounds like bs.
- I'm telling you, it isn't mine.
- Then the last thing we want is someone blaming you when they find their gun missing.
- The money's yours.
- Yeah, but you're not leaving until we know where you got that gun.
- All right.
I--
I was fixing my nephew's bed this morning.
And then that's when I found it under the mattress.
- Your nephew the clarinet player?
- No, his name's Andre.
Never been in any kind of trouble with the police.
When I saw that gun under Andre's bed, you know, it scared the hell out of me, and believe me, when he comes home from school,
I'm gon' get to the bottom of this.
- Is my uncle in some kind of trouble?
- That depends on how this goes.
He found your gun.
- What gun?
- The one under your mattress.
- But I don't know anything about that.
- I mean, if he found it, i didn't put it there.
- So you want your uncle to take the weight for this?
- No, ma'am.
- You shot somebody, didn't you, Andre?
- If that gun was used to shoot somebody, we're gonna find out.
Maybe we can help you now.
But once we walk out of here, all bets are off.
Do you understand?
- Bad decision, Andre.
- Get back to class.
- The serial number tracks an Indiana gun store sale in '89.
- Ballistics says it fires just fine.
Loading, not so much.
The spring on the magazine release is shot to hell.
Latent didn't find any prints on the weapon other than the e-lims you provided.
- As a matter of fact...
Damon cafferty.
Age 19.
Two priors.
- Can I get in there?
That's a gang tatt.
- Damon cafferty's the banger that wouldn't cooperate in the Lara Haley shooting.
- Stone's just starting that trial now.
- Part of our opening statement will be making an emotional connection with our jurors.
- I'll be telling them about your daughter.
Taking them through what happened to her that day.
It may be hard for you to hear.
- We'll be all right.
- If you need to step out at any time-  we live with this every single day.
- I was holding Lara's hand...
When the shooting started.
- We'll do what we need to do to see the person who did this go to jail.
- Mr. stone?
I'll be taking over the defense case.
Kerry was one year behind me at Michigan law.
- Uh, two.
Believe it or not, this is my very first murder trial.
Butterflies, you know?
So, uh, I would be more than grateful for any professional courtesies you might throw my way.
Not that I'm looking for you to take it easy on me.
They're the parents of the little girl your client killed.
On the afternoon of July 11th,
Lara Haley was walking home from summer school with her mom, corrine.
It's a walk they've taken a hundred times before.
It was just another average day.
They talked about Lara's science classes, and what they'd cook for dinner.
But it was the last average day that Lara would ever have.
And the last moment that corrine Haley would ever spend with her daughter.
'Cause a few hours earlier, this man, Chris Stackhouse, a member of a south side street gang known as the drexel posse, found an instagram message on his phone from a rival gang.
It said, and I'm paraphrasing some rough language here,
"had sex with your girlfriend last night.
Hahaha."
Attached to the message was a photograph of a half naked young lady.
The defendant then grabbed a .9 millimeter handgun, pulled a hoodie over his head, and rode his bike to the corner of 68th street and marshfield Avenue, where he opened fire on a group of rival gang members
who charmingly call themselves pd killaz.
The man he was gunning for, Damon cafferty, was wounded.
But a stray bullet from the defendant's gun tore into Lara's back, killing her as corrine cradled her in her arms and felt the life drain out of her daughter.
- 304.
- Yes, this is a very tragic situation for Lara's parents.
But when you look at the evidence logically...
- We just found your murder weapon.
It was in another kid's bedroom.
- I'm sorry, would you bear with us, please?
- Are you sure?
- Damon cafferty's blood spatter is on the business end of the gun.
- Looks like you might have the wrong kid on trial here.
- The ballistic tests confirmed it.
Lara Haley was killed with a bullet from the weapon turned in at the gun buy-back.
- We knew there were a few problems going in.
Just because some other kid was babysitting the murder weapon, doesn't mean the shooter isn't sitting at the defense table.
He seems to be a model citizen.
- So what was the gun doing under his mattress?
- We'll get a continuance.
It'll buy us some time to find more answers.
- What makes you think judge sanford will Grant us a continuance?
- Newly discovered evidence.
- So you're going to let schmidt know about the gun?
- I want a conviction as much as anybody.
- If you were defense counsel, wouldn't you want to know about this?
- Landmark case of state v. Jagger.
You can't always get what you want.
- Law's not rock 'n' roll.
- My client wants his day in court.
Enough delays already.
- Why do you need more time, Mr. stone?
- Our investigators just recovered the gun that killed Lara Haley.
- Where?
- In another teenager's bedroom.
- My client's been swearing up and down he didn't do this.
- He bragged about it.
- We don't want to see an innocent man convicted any more than Ms. schmidt does.
We need a week to investigate.
- You've got 72 hours.
- In light of this development, judge, my client should be released without bail.
- Well, the people strongly oppose.
I'll release him, but I'm ordering that he be restricted to his home.
You understand that, Ms. schmidt?
If I hear that he puts one foot on the street, he goes back to county, and I'll slap a contempt finding on both of you.
- I don't see why this guy can't just call an uber.
- You have something better to do?
- Than running a car service for a murderer?
- You're here to transport my client?
- That's what the court order says.
- You know you're not allowed to ask him any questions, right?
- Was that in the order?
- It's in the fifth amendment.
- I have an idea.
Why don't you ride along with us to englewood?
Make sure we don't violate any of your client's constitutional rights.
- It's okay.
- Stackhouse!
- Oh, remember, Chris.
I don't wanna be rolling' up on my block with pd.
- You heard your lawyer.
Get inside, stay inside.
- We'll be back to pick you up Friday morning.
- Can you believe this knucklehead?
- P-d-k drilling' snitches today.
One down.
Need an ambo at 62nd and wolcott.
- Chris Stackhouse took one round to the thigh.
He's being treated at Chicago med, but no reason he can't limp back into court when the trial resumes.
- Our shooter jumped on the Ryan.
We lost him in traffic.
- I don't suppose you got a dmv hit on the plate?
- We're pulling known pdk mug shots to see if we can put a name to the face.
- What about posting up on their turf?
Maybe you can spot the shooter.
- It's not great timing.
Stackhouse's release lit a spark between pdk and the drexel posse.
- Why?
- 'Cause a banger who skates out from under a murder charge looks like a snitch.
- There were three shootings in englewood just last night.
- Bystanders?
- A pedestrian caught a round in his neck.
Missed his jugular by a half inch.
- The district has its hands full.
There is a surge in place.
- The mag release on that thing's shot.
There's a ticking clock on the Haley trial.
- Andre had nothing to do with that little girl getting killed.
He goes to school, and he comes home.
I don't let him leave the house without me going with him.
- The principal at Harper speaks very highly of your nephew.
But the fact remains, he had a gun under his bed.
- Which I turned in.
- A gun that was used in the homicide of Lara Haley.
I know this is hard, Mr. Williams.
- You're asking me to throw another boy to the lions?
- It's your choice, but it looks to me like Andre's a young man who has a shot to make a life for himself.
You can protect this other kid, or you can be straight with us.
- The day the girl was shot,
Andre's cousin, keo, came to the house.
Keo Vincent.
And, uh, he said he was, uh, coming from the playground and needed to shower.
- To scrub off gunshot residue?
- Or a sweaty kid who needed to wash up.
Something heavy.
- About the size of a gun?
- Yes, ma'am.
And when he left here, he was wearing Andre's clothes.
- Why didn't you tell this to our investigators?
Keo is my sister's only child.
But between you and me, kid's been in some trouble before.
- Where do we find keo?
- This is drexel posse territory.
- It's the kid in the white tank top.
The chief keef wannabe.
- Keo.
Yo, keo!
- What?
- Talk to you for a minute.
- I'm busy.
- Yeah?
- These gentlemen here are with the state's attorney.
They want to talk to you about Chris Stackhouse.
- He's locked up.
- There's a lot of that going around.
- He said you were with him on marshfield a few months ago when that little girl got killed.
- I don't think so.
That's hella cold.
- No one said anything about a case.
- You ain't come all the way out here for the scenery.
- I think we need to discuss this where we have your full attention.
- Are you arresting me?
'Cause I didn't drill nobody.
I guess black lives do matter.
- Chill out, keo.
- Keo had six juvie arrests by the age of 15.
He did a bid at jdc.
He's suspected of being cliqued up with a drexel posse crew on his block.
- A junior associate?
- A kid who'd try to make a name for himself by spraying bullets at a rival gang.
If this little wise-ass killed Lara Haley, he's going away for a long time.
- We've got an all-out war now between drexel posse and pdk.
- Gang intel sent me this after Stackhouse got shot a couple of days ago.
A gang member from pdk posted an instagram threatening Stackhouse ten minutes before he was shot.
Drexel retaliates by shooting three pdk bangers.
And then they posted photos of it on social media.
The two gangs tweet some insults back and forth, and finally, there's a challenge to throw down by the railroad tracks near lindblom park.
"Pdk bitches gonna bleed."
- Bottom line-- three dead, five wounded.
All in the space of eight hours.
- So basically, they're inciting these retaliations on social media?
You call out a rival in a dm.
Drop a dis video.
Geo-tag your turf.
- Cyber-banging.
- Makes "boyz n the hood" look like a Disney movie.
- Cell tower pings put keo Vincent on the block when Lara Haley was killed.
I'm getting this strong feeling we actually do have the wrong drexel posse banger on trial.
- Your cell phone account?
- "The customer agrees not to use the phone or the account for any unlawful purpose."
- I'd say orchestrating a gang war in a series of digital messages qualifies as an unlawful purpose.
- Maybe, but it'll take years to litigate.
- And that's why I'm shutting off their phones.
- Let's see if i understand this, Mr. stone.
You want to unilaterally terminate cellular and Internet service for 39 individuals.
- The Chicago pd maintains a strategic subject list.
It's more commonly called the heat list.
It ranks past offenders who are most likely to perpetrate gun violence in the future.
- Who makes this list?
- It's based on a computer algorithm developed by the Illinois institute of technology.
- So you're telling me some computer wonk on a college campus can predict the future?
- Yes, your honor.
Young men at the top of the heat list are shooting each other in englewood as we speak.
- And how's turning off their smartphones gonna stop them from killing each other?
- As you can see from these social media messages we've pulled, the violence is being fueled by these gang members on their devices.
- Well...
You have whet my appetite.
I'll Grant a full hearing on your request for injunctive relief, but in addition to the service providers you've named, i want the Illinois aclu here on behalf of the account holders.
We'll put it on the calendar for next Friday.
- Thank you, but this needs to be heard tomorrow before there's more blood on the street.
We can have all the parties notified within the hour.
- I can't walk across the hall without taking my cell phone.
- But you don't use it to light up your neighbor.
- Maybe there's a way to do this more surgically.
These gang members can migrate from one to the next as easily as I can change the brand of beer I order.
We don't have time to play whack-a-mole with these killers.
- This city's buried too many of its children.
- You're trying to do what?
- I don't know.
Save a few lives, maybe.
- By turning off people's cell phones?
- We can't just sit up here and be reactive.
We try a few cases, and we move on to the next, and it doesn't make a dent.
What's happening now in the south side of Chicago-- right now, tonight-- is a public emergency, and we need to think outside the box.
- The last thing I need is the fcc breathing down my neck.
- So we'll just sit on our hands and let these kids kill each other over a few blocks of turf.
- Come on, you know there's middle ground between doing nothing and this.
- Why not try to stop the worst offenders from perpetrating this violence before it happens?
- Back in the day, they called that
"rounding up the usual suspects."
- Using race-neutral criteria.
Felony histories, gang affiliations.
- Who's in the gangs?
- The shooters.
- People of color.
- Lara Haley was a person of color.
I can't get their guns, but maybe I can get the phones they're using to help kill each other, or any other innocent kid who just happens to be nearby.

Okay.
I'm not gonna pull the plug on you, Peter.
But if the justice department comes knocking on my door with a civil rights complaint,
I'll throw you under the bus so damn fast, it'll make your head spin.
- Understood.
- And god help you if someone dies because one of these kids can't use their cell phone in an emergency.
- One the aclu's biggest problems with the heat list is transparency.
The police won't reveal all of the criteria they used for the algorithm, or say who's on the list, never mind provide basic due process to challenge it.
The city of Chicago has demonized hundreds of young men in secret.
- And what about the fact that the state's attorney wants to shut down their smartphones?
- The last time I looked, there was something called the first amendment.
- The U.S. supreme court decided last year that the Internet is a public utility.
So my company can't pick and choose who we provide service to.
- But isn't it a fact that users who issue death threats are violating the terms of their customer agreement?
- Maybe yes, maybe no.
That's a contractual matter for us to decide.
Not you.
- Are you suggesting this court doesn't have the authority to order these terminations?
- I wouldn't have a problem if the consumer could appeal the shut off, but you're just speculating.
- A ten-year-old girl named Lara Haley was murdered in a shooting instigated on your company's wireless service.
How is that speculation?
- Is there anything else, Mr. stone?
- No further questions, your honor.
Oh, just one more thing.
- The state's attorney is asking for novel and unprecedented relief.
But the record number of dead and wounded is also unprecedented.
And they are more than statistics.
These are young lives being snuffed out.
Parents grieving.
A community gripped by fear.
If I get reversed on appeal, so be it.
But I find that there is no constitutional right to operate a smartphone that is being utilized as a deadly weapon.
Shut down these 39 accounts immediately.
- Here you go, 39 end of service confirmations from the companies.
- There's some unhappy bangers on the south side tonight.
- And the aclu's notice of appeal.
- Slow play our response.
We want to milk these terminations as long as we can.
- You have no idea if this is going to work.
- Thank you for coming, Mr. Williams.
Andre can wait in reception while we-  you need to hear what he has to say.
Tell him.
- Keo's been calling me about the gun.
He got up in my face at school yesterday.
Told me that he needed his gun back.
Then he came by the house later, and started pounding on the door.
I pretended I wasn't home, but I'm afraid if I go back to school tomorrow, something bad might happen.
- This is all gonna work out.
We're gonna charge keo with murder.
His visit to your apartment the other day, and the blood on the gun you turned in are key pieces of evidence.
But we can't proceed without you.
We'll need you and Andre to testify in the grand jury.
- Testify against my sister's boy?
- Your sister's boy killed an innocent young girl.
What if it was Andre?
- Andre won't have keo threatening him anymore.
- Aren't you tired of all this?
- Damn right, I am.
- Then help us get justice.
- I've tried to do the right thing this whole time.
I turned in the gun like I was supposed to.
I told you the truth about keo when you asked me.
I dropped what I was doing, and came over here tonight.
But if drexel posse finds out i was anywhere near a courtroom, or a grand jury, what do you expect is going to happen to me and Andre?
- We can offer you both some protection.
I'm sure you've got programs, protocols, whatever.
But it's the law of the street we talking about now.
These kids still paying back grudges from five years ago.
- So what are you going to do?
- We'll stay with some friends in wrigleyville for a few days.
After that, I don't know.
But I've done all I can do for you now.
I need to keep me and Andre alive.
- We appreciate your help.
Stay safe.
- So that's it?
Keo Vincent skates, and the haleys get a final kick in the gut.
- Cubs won.
- You came up here to give me a baseball score?
The Lara Haley trial isn't going well.
- Go home, Peter.
There'll be another innocent victim next week, and then another, and there's nothing you nor I can do about it.
- You know, if I believed that,
I'd be coaching at some junior college in Wisconsin.
My grandparents lived in this small town in eastern Tennessee.
And I went down there many years ago to talk to this lawyer who was drafting their wills.
The walls of his offices were lined with paintings of trees.
- What kind of trees?
- He'd painted every tree in the county where a black man was lynched.
Black kids killing black kids.
This is 300 years in the making.
- It doesn't mean we can't try to make things better.
- Better has to come from the inside.
Not from politicians like me, or do-gooders like you.
You know, there are a lot of people who think nothing's going to change until the mothers and fathers in my community start behaving like parents.
Enforcing some rules.
Reading books to their sons and daughters.
- I didn't say that.
- No.
But you think it.
Am I right?
Guilty as charged.
But we both know it's more complicated.
- You're damn right it is.
Don't beat yourself up.
You are nothing if not persistent.
What's that supposed to mean?
- You found a way to strong-arm all those big telecom companies.
And I'm sure you're gonna find a way to take down the one little gangbanger that killed Lara Haley.
- Your client's out of the hospital?
- He's on crutches, but he's good to go.
- You've had your 72 hours, Mr. stone.
We're moving to dismiss our case against Ms. schmidt's client.
- Fabulous, we consent-- - but...
We're still pressing forward with his trial.
- We'd like for Mr. Stackhouse to believe there's still a case against him.
Same with the jury, and anyone outside this room.
- You're asking me to preside over what's essentially a ruse?
- Well, i wouldn't use that word.
We'd like the trial to keep going so I can call a witness to the stand named keo Vincent.
He's a gang associate of Ms. schmidt's client, and in all probability, the one who fired the shot that killed Lara Haley.
- I want the right person in jail for this crime, but what you're proposing is highly unusual.
- But not without precedent.
In certain extraordinary circumstances, shadow proceedings have been conducted in New York.
- And in operation greylord, right here in cook county.
- Okay, just so I'm clear on this.
You've mistakenly charged my client with murder.
As a result, he was shot and wounded, and is lucky to be alive.
And now you want to use him as bait?
I won't be a party to this.
- Give me a minute.
This is my first homicide trial, and you're asking me to do something that's shady at best.
- I'm deceiving a client, participating in a sham trial.
- Okay.
Wait.
We know who killed Lara Haley now, and the only way we're gonna get this guy is if we all take a little risk.
When I started here, they had me doing research in appeals.
Stone was prosecuting Victor cathridge.
- The guy who murdered three women on the l.
- One day during the trial, i walked into the courtroom to drop off a brief.
Stone was cross-examining a witness, and while I was waiting there,
I saw cathridge was fidgeting with something under the defense table.
So I tip-toed into the well, handed the brief to Peter's second chair, and as I was walking out,
I flipped over the defense table.
Before anyone knew what was going on, there were four deputies on top of cathridge, one had me in a choke hold until I could point them to the razorblade cathridge had wedged under the table.
If you want the right results, sometimes you have to do something unorthodox.
- So what do you say?
-Whois it ?
- Peoples gas, ma'am.
Sorry to disturb you, but I'm checking on a gas leak.
-Nogasinhere .
- Either you let me in to check it out, or I go downstairs to shut off your gas and electric.
State's attorney, Mrs. Vincent.
- You tricked me.
- What's going on, ma?
I got nothing to say to you.
- We have a material witness order.
- It means the judge wants him to come to court to testify.
Give me a call when you get there.
- You two can settle this later.
It should only take a couple of hours.
- Call your next witness, Mr. stone.
- The people call keo Vincent.
- Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you god?
- Do I got a choice?
- I'll take that as a yes.
- Morning, keo.
I'd like to call your attention to the afternoon of July 11th.
Were you in the englewood neighborhood that day?
- Andre said I was there?
- Just answer the question.
- I don't remember.
- But you do remember changing into some of Andre's clothes around that time, right?
- What kind of clothes?
- It was a black Polo shirt, some blue jeans.
He's littler than me.
We don't even wear the same size.
- But you do remember being there now?
- Can't say for sure.
- And speaking with your uncle, Ernest Williams.
- If I was there and he was there, then yeah,
I would've talked to him.
- Maybe you remember that Andre gave you something.
He gave you a-- it was a bag.
Just a small, brown bag with something heavy in it.
- I gotta answer all these questions?
- Do your best.
- I don't know nothing about any brown bag.
- Judge, I'd like to show the witness what's being offered as people's exhibit 1.
- All right.
- You ever seen that particular gun before?
- No.
- Fair enough.
Can defense counsel have an opportunity to see this exhibit?
Actually, keo, you wanna make sure that thing's not loaded?
- Chamber's clear.
- And what about the magazine?
- Clip's empty, too.
- Can I see the gun, please?
- Now, the magazine release on this gun-- it's inoperable.
But you knew that because this is your gun.
That's why you had to smack the handle a few times to get the mag to release.
Just like you did four months ago when you loaded this same gun, jumped on your bike, and rode to the corner of 68th street and marshfield Avenue where you opened fire on a group of gang rivals,
killing a ten-year-old girl in the process.
- Man, you making all this up.
Coming at me about some nonsense about some button that don't work.
That means I drill somebody?
- Arrest this man for the murder of Lara Haley.
- Let me go!
Let me go, man!
- I didn't do nothing to that girl.
- You're sure he's the one who killed our daughter?
- I am now.
Sometimes you have to make a wrong turn before you find your way.
I'm sorry to put you through this again.
- We'll be there.
- Thank you.
- That boy was barely older than Lara was.
- Nope.
You're on your own now.
- Hey, Stackhouse.
- Yeah?
- Crossroads for you.
- What you mean?
- You just beat a murder rap and a bullet.
Keep doing what you're doing, sooner or later, your luck's gonna run out.
Here.
A guy I know runs a jobs training program in Hyde park.
- Maybe.
- Now was that so terrible?
- I hate to admit it, but I did enjoy the show.
- And you get to walk back to your office and tell them you won your first homicide trial.
- Not bad.
At least I can say that with a straight face.
See you in court, counsel.
-I 'mgettingcalls.
Detroit, Baltimore.
They want to know if this thing actually works.
- Well, the two gangs in englewood have been quiet for a couple of days now.
- You can't kick millenials off social media forever.
It's like air and water to us.
They'll find out how to get back on soon enough.
- Still, not a bad week.
- All it took was a phony trial, tricking a 15-year-old into incriminating himself, and goosing the due process clause andthefirstamendment.
- All with judicial approval.
And a last minute save.
- Oh, no.
