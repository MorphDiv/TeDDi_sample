This is how it ends.
Same ending as every story that starts with Santa Blanca Cartel.
Before they took over, Bolivia was a paradise.
Now it''s a narco-state.
Ruled with an iron fist.
Ricky, you have to know it's going to end like this.
No, she did.
No.
Tell her to stop.
If she would just give me a break.
That's what babies do.
Don't go.
I know, I am sorry.
It should be a couple of hours.
Why?
Baby, it's work...
You do look very handsome.Thank you.
Can you get me some ice cream?
Ice cream?
It is almost midnight.
I know, but you said you're gonna be back in a couple of hours.
I love you.
It's a cancer.
And until we eliminate it, there is no telling how much damage it's going to cause.
Well, last I checked, Officer Bowman, the CIA was not in the business of curing cancer.
I don't intend to cure it.
I'm going to eradicate it.
Cut it out, right at the source.
Their network relies on fear, violence and intimidation.
And our asset informed us that three of their cartel heads are meeting at one of their compounds, tonight.
This is our best shot.
If we don't act immediately, we won't have another opportunity like this.
We are sending you dossiers on the key players now.
Position!
Head of Santa Blanca's security.
He made a name for himself protecting local narcos and then his reputation, butchering them to prove his allegiance to Santa Blanca.
And that is Nidia Flores, aka The Beauty Queen.
Head of Santa Blanca's smuggling operations.
The new shipping route she's mapped out is the reason for tonight's meet.
And thanks to her, they are about to go global.
She's hammered out all of the details with Ricky Sandoval, head of cartel's finance.
He also just happens to be one of ours.
We've never had an asset in this deep before.
It's taken seven years.
He's finally in the inner circle of El Sueno.
The true mastermind of Santa Blanca.
He is known as the Dream.
He is more of a nightmare.
Started as a sicario when he was 12 and racked up an unimaginable body count before he turned 15.
This is not just a job to him, it's a religion.
And those who he doesn't convert, he destroys.
Let's begin.
We have to act tonight.
Three of their top lieutenants in one location.
We will never get another chance to take out these many cartel heads at the same time.
Which would put us in direct violation of at least a half a dozen international regulations that were all devised to prevent just this type of American interference.
Come on, Karen, you seriously need me to do your job for you?
No.
Our guy has already recruited locals that are ready to carry out the attack.
That keeps the Agency's hands clean, and it makes me really fucking good at my job.
Sir.
You better watch your ass, Bowman.
All right, I'm ready to sign off.
But if something goes sideways on this.
Anything.
Then Santa Blanca and El Sueno will be the least of your worries.
Have the rebels get into position.
What the fuck, Muro?
Stay still.
Cover Sueno.
How did you know?
How did you know about the meeting?
Who told you?
Who told you?
And you?
What's your name?
Ana.
How many more of you are out there?
I asked you a question.
Ana!
Do you know life's greatest truth?
No.
No.
Take the gun.
I want you to pull the trigger.
No, he is my brother.
Take the gun.
If he is not dead, by the time I count to three,
Muro and his men will do unspeakable things to your entire family.
Please.
Adios, hermano.
No.
Adios, Papi.
Adios, hermanos.
Adios, Abuelita.
One...
Two...
Three.
I know who you are.
What's that?
Princesa, go back to bed.
Mommy needs to work.
We need to find out who was behind this.
We send them a very loud, very permanent message.
It could be one of your boy toys.
Every one knows how they go crazy for La Reina.
Maybe you talk in your sleep.
Maybe it's one of your shithead sicarios opening their mouth when they shouldn't.
Pendejo.
For now, we keep moving.
Just, for a little while.
When have you ever known me to run and cover?
Weakness invites challenge.
We stand our ground.
Have Yayo ramp up production.
Tell the old man he doesn't have a choice.
Let our enemies see us thriving.
For El Cardenal.
This charm ties the rebels to his church.
See what he knows.
What can I do?
Some things are worth dying for.
Like familia.
Go home to your wife.
Tell her you love her.
Stay safe till we find the rat.
It's not going to happen.
We've already arranged an extraction for you.
And my wife.
Say it, Karen.
And my wife.
This isn't a negotiation.
You are my asset, which means you are my responsibility.
You and you alone.
Not some cartel cucayou had the shit judgment to fall for.
You are talking about my fucking wife.
If I leave, it's the same as pulling the trigger myself.
I am telling you this as the closest thing you have to a friend.
We cannot risk civilian collateral.
So it's you or nobody.
Stay and you're a dead man.
Well, a dead agent.
The one congress will have a lot of questions about being here.
To leverage your life for hers.
She is pregnant, Karen.
Monica is pregnant.
Please, I'm asking you as a friend.
Extraction point a mile from you house. 6 p.m.
Yayo.
The cartel's new hybrid?
My new hybrid.
My country...
My people...
My family...
Remind El Sueno these plants don't belong to Santa Blanca.
Everything belongs to Santa Blanca.
And he has a message of his own for you.
The Book of Revelations 19:11.
"And there before me, it was a white horse.
"Whose rider was called Faithful
"and True.
"And he is dressed in a robe dipped
"in the blood of his vanquished enemies,
"over whom He always prevails.
"And His name... is the word of God."
And it is He who binds us.
For we are all la familia de Santa Blanca.
Unless we be deserving, of the full force, of God's fury.
Let us pray.
You have no place in the house of God.
Let's not forget.
El Sueno gave you this church after you were ex-communicated.
And everything he gives, can be taken away.
Easily.
What does he wish of me?
One of our compounds was hit last night.
We are still depending on you to keep the people afraid
Brother and sister.
This is one of their charm.
Means they came from this flock.
Your flock.
I need to know who they are, and who they've been talking to.
Babe.
In the kitchen.
Hey.Where have you been?
Hey, baby.Where you've been?
We gotta...
El Sueno sent me.
We gotta hangout for a little while.
We had trouble at one of the compounds and this is standard procedure.
Really?
What?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Don't take long, guapisima.
Increase production?
Si.
Even if El Yayo's cocaleros had the manpower...
They will.
He is ordering their children to work the fields.
Until we get the next batch we could play with the purity a bit.
We could cut it with some Mannitol, Rohypnol, some B12.
You know, I bet your coke head sisters back at the sorority wouldn't even know the difference.
First of all, I was hired to increase purity, not the other way around.
Second of all, fuck you, Marcus.
Hey, language.
Listen, cocaine production on this massive of a scale isn't magic.
It's science.
It has limits and so do we.
Nidia!
There must be some kind of miscommunication or something.
Let that be a lesson.
Nobody is irreplaceable.
Not her.
Not Gringa.
And definitely not you.
I will tell Sueno to expect the increased shipment in the morning.
And don't forget, that's one more kilo you're behind on delivery.
It's all right, Carlos.
You can tell Muro everything you told me.
Well... they are good kids.
Ana and Gabriel.
But when they lost their mother, due to an overdose...
It changed them.
Especially my son.
He started getting all these ideas about...
Santa Blanca.
What kind of ideas?
Carlos, there is no need to fear.
This is a place of forgiveness.
He told me he would talk to this man.
One who come to the labs where he worked.
Tell him in secret to fight the cartel.
Take his country back.
When I demanded to know who would say such things, he and Ana left.In all that time
you didn't think to say anything... to anyone about these doubts.
It would have been a death sentence.
I can help them remember that Santa Blanca is our way of life.
Sooner than you think.
Gracias.
What else do we know?
The boy was a guard at the rear access corridor.
El Sueno wants those security tapes.
I just walked through there.
We don't have any cameras in those corridors.
It's because you don't know where to look, Reina.
Neither will the person on those tapes.
He is our traitor.
Bring him to me.
Alive!
God damn it.
I have to tell you, man.
This whole thing turned into a fucking mess.
Your wife?
It's her house, man, she can take as much as time she wants.
The Bolivian armed forces picked up our chopper, entering their air space without permission.
If they are not at the extraction point, we can't wait.
Get there, Ricky.
You need to tell me the truth.
Stop the car.
Monica, get in the car.
Fucking bullshit.
Get in the car.
Fuck!
Get back in the car.
Fucking tell me the truth.
Tell me the fucking truth, God damn it.
Tell me!
I am DEA.
I am DEA.
My God.
I am sorry.
I am really sorry.
How did you lie to me like this?
I didn't lie.Yes, you did.
Not about everything.
We are real.
Okay, this is real.
This is bullshit.
Okay?
Very soon there is going to be a helicopter landing... just over that ridge.
Okay?
Right now.
Can you trust me?
Please.
Come on.
Vamos!
Rapido.
Come on, come on.
Okay, listen to me.
Baby, I'm gonna draw the fire.
That's gonna give you the time to get the helicopter, okay?
I can't do this alone.You have to.
I need you to.
Okay.
What if we just disappeared?
From everything, from everyone...
From all these people, just...
Yeah...
Your family's here...
We are together.
It's crazy.
It's not crazy.
We just hop in a plane and leave.
We don't even tell anyone.
So, we can go somewhere and nobody will know anything and just...
Baby, just...
I need you to give me just a little bit more time, okay?
I promise you.
Someday...
Okay?
Yeah.
Ricky...
Ricky.
Ricky.
You had to know it was going to end like this.
The people that sent you will pay for what they have done.
Information is coming in that in the pre-dawn hours, the US Embassy in La Paz, Bolivia was attacked.
Explosion at five minutes past three in the morning devastated the embassy here on the west side of the continent.
No details on motive and no indication of who's responsible.
Truck ran into the embassy building.
At this hour, there are unconfirmed reports of the number...
Intelligence suggest the only group in the country, capable of carrying out an attack on that scale is Santa Blanca.
Which puts it all on you, Bowman.
And so now because of your little operation, the Santa Blanca Cartel just declared war on the US.
How do you intend to clean this up?
Without the cartel even knowing it.
We send in a team that doesn't exist.
Gentlemen... one of our own is in the hands of the enemy.
Payback means bringing the Santa Blanca Cartel to the fucking ground by any means necessary.
If El Sueno wants a war, you are just the ones to bring it to him.
Anything else?
Before we get started.
Agent Sandoval.
Yeah, actually...
Do you believe in ghosts?
