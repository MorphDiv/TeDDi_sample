(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Who needs a dating app when you've got this dating chap?
It's Paddy McGuinness!
(CHEERING AND WHISTLING)
Thank you!
Oh.
Hello and welcome to Take Me Out.
I'm Time Lord McGuinness!
(LAUGHTER)
Er...
And this is my Love Tardis.
I've travelled to the ends of the galaxy to pair off four sexy Cybermen with 30 dainty Daleks.
Expect a date!
# I live my day as if it was the last
# Live my day as if there was no past
# Doin' it all night, all summer
# Doin' it the way I want to
# Yeah, I dance my heart out till the dawn
# But I won't be done when morning comes
# Doin' it all night, all summer
# Gonna spend it like no other
# Now I've found another crush
# The lush life's given me a rush
# Had one chance to make me blush
# Second time is one too late
# Now I've found another crush
# The lush life's given me a rush
# Had one chance to make me blush
# Second time is one too late #
(LAUGHTER) I was in the supermarket and a guy walked past and said, "She's fit."
Harry's like, "Oi, she's single, want her number?" (LAUGHTER)
Tiny Tinder, this fella.
Harry, if you're watching, get your own job, sunshine.
It'd be, "Who are you here with, the bride or the groom?"
"No-one, I just like weddings." (LAUGHTER)
They think I'm having a laugh, but I'm not even joking. (LAUGHTER)
Sophie, what kind of bloke are you looking for?
I'm looking for an adventurous guy, because I'm pretty adventurous.
OK. ..and went to a crocodile and alligator sanctuary and learned how to get on top of the alligator, find out its sex.
..how you find out the sex of a crocodile.
Come on.
(LAUGHTER) It's taking me back to my stag night!
Yeah, that's it.
Our girls, everybody!
(CHEERING)
I'm trying out some new looks tonight.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERING) Single man, reveal yourself.
# So try me in the morning
# When the sun comes rising up
# Try me, in the afternoon
# Bet you just can't get enough
# Try me in the evening
# Satisfaction guaranteed
# Baby, I got what you need
# You gotta try me, try me
# Try me
(CHEERING)
(CHEERING) Good start.
So there are 25 girls who have kept their lights on.
That's it.
Relax for a second, I'll go and have a chat.
There's a lot more girls with lights on.
(APPLAUSE)
It could be for anyone.
But, yeah, I think you're really good-looking and I'd love to wipe the sweat off your head... (LAUGHTER)
..with your handkerchief!
You've got formasual down to a point.
Dee's muscled his way through the first round, but it will be as easy as A, B, C for Dee in the next?
If he's a yes, don't give it a press.
I'd describe myself as in-Dee-pendent,
Dee-lightful and Dee-licious.
I like to think of myself as a worldy bloke.
Every three weeks I take a trip abroad for holidays.
Often, I rock up at the airport and get a flight to anywhere sunny.
My mates are always winding me up about it, but for the right woman I'd happily make a big splash.
In my spare time, I like to put on a velvet thong, paint myself orange and stand on stage, because I'm a competitive body builder.
If you're looking for an old-fashioned guy that believes chivalry is still important, leave your light on.
May, you've still got your light on.
Good answer there.
Get through this next round, you've definitely got yourself a date.
It's been a first-class performance so far.
If travel-nut Dee can get through round three he's off to Fernando's.
Stay calm, there's a wild animal on the loose.
(GROWLING) It's a jungle out there in the dating world.
A gorilla has stolen our girls' hearts.
(GROWLING) But don't panic, I'll catch him.
(GROWLING)
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
(ALL CLAP TO THE RHYTHM)
# Monkey magic
# Monkey magic
# Monkey magic (LAUGHTER)
# Monkey magic
# Monkey magic
# Monkey magic, monkey magic
# Monkey magic... #
(CHEERING AND WHISTLING)
Congratulations, Dee, you've got yourself a date!
Fetch!
Yasmin, why's your light still on?
I've found my Tarzan, I can be your Jane.
I hope you take that velvet thong to Fernando's!
Shauney, why's your light still on?
I knew he was in good shape but not that good.
I don't know what I just watched, but I'm scared and turned on.
(LAUGHTER)
Funnily enough, so am I!
(LAUGHTER) This is it, Dee.
Now the power is in your hands.
I'm going to give you the chance to get it down to two girls.
Go and turn off the lights of the girls who aren't Dee-licious.
(SHOUTS OF ENCOURAGEMENT)
Oh, Shauney's gone!
That way?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
They know about you, but what do you want to know about them?
I'm looking for a girl to have an arm wrestle with. (LAUGHTER)
Yes!
Oh-ho.
You've got your game faces, you two.
Oh!
You're coming back!
Wow!
Here we go!
Wow!
Those two are strong.
OK, it is May and it is Yasmin.
Before you go out there, there's something you should know.
The flight to Fernando's should be interesting.
One of these girls likes to eat raw onions and broccoli.
(SHOUTS OF ENCOURAGEMENT)
(CHEERING)
Oh!
Come on, get round here.
Hi.
(LAUGHTER) Take some Febreze for on the plane.
Dee's Love At First Light was...
You're off to the isle of Fernando's!
(CHEERING)
# Groove is in the heart
# Groove is in the heart
# Groove is in the heart
The girls were super-strong, I was scared.
(CHEERING) We'll find out how Hannah and George got on.
See you in a blip.
(CHEERING)
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
If the next lad was an ice-skating duo he'd be Phwoar-vill and Dean.
First, let's see if there were any snogs for Hannah and George.
George is someone I normally wouldn't go for, thinking he's posh.
George and Hannah.
(GROANS) I've never been so sick.
It was hard to get to know him because of how sick I felt.
Hopefully, I'll get to know him a bit better later.
I think he was impressed.
No!
(LAUGHTER)
(GIGGLES)
(LAUGHTER)
Erm, not a 'proper' proper girlfriend, no.
I don't think I should be saying that on a first date with a girl.
Lesson learnt.
Would you want to go on another date?
Oh, well. (CHUCKLES) I think George took it not the best.
Instead, you're in a right old pickle. (APPLAUSE)
(LAUGHTER)
Single man, reveal yourself.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
# Hungry eyes
# One look at you and I can't disguise
# I've got hungry eyes
# I feel the magic between you and I
# Hungry eyes
# One look at you and I can't disguise
# I've got hungry eyes #
30 lights on, Johnny.
Looking round all those girls, write down your Love At First Light.
(LAUGHTER) Maybe later tonight it can be on the floor in Fernando's.
Oh, that was smooth.
(PRETENDS TO RETCH) (LAUGHTER)
Absolutely fantastic start, Johnny.
After round one, Johnny's not gone rotten, but will our girls think he's ripe for the picking?
If he's for you, you know what to do.
I've been single a year now, it's time to settle down with the perfect girl.
For me, dating is all about romance.
I love showing girls how special they are.
You can't go wrong with a love letter.
Once I made a memory jar for my ex, filled it with bits of paper for every day we spent together.
Camping under the stars, Romeo has nothing on me.
A little pampering never hurt anyone.
Don't worry, I'll make sure you get the right treatment, too.
I'm a stylish guy, I'll never be seen without my trusty man bag.
Forget your labels, it's all about the brown paper bag.
(LAUGHTER) I get a brand-new one every week.
To bag yourself a great date, leave your light on and I'll treat you to an amazing time in Fernando's.
(APPLAUSE) All right.
21 girls kept their lights on.
Let me find out why those nine turned off.
I can't have someone looking prettier than me in the morning.
I have a bath, a glass of wine and a bit of a face mask.
Some good compliments here, Johnny.
Get through this next round, you've got yourself a date.
So far, romantic Johnny has pulled our girls' heart strings, but will he get a date once his mate lets the cat out of the man bag?
Girls, listen up.
(LAUGHTER) He might be a serial dater, but leave your lights on and he can make you his full-time girl.
Congratulations, you're going on a date!
15 girls kept their lights on.
I just admire that you took a girl out for breakfast.
(LAUGHTER) "Where shall we meet?" "Dave's cafe, 7:30am." Brilliant.
(LAUGHTER)
Once you've had a date with me, you wouldn't want another two ladies.
(CHEERING)
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Turn off the lights of the girls who don't dingle your dangle.
(SHOUTS OF ENCOURAGEMENT)
Turn 13 lights off, Johnny.
Rose, Becky, Gillian.
Oh, Becky's gone.
Rebecca.
Two at once over there.
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry.
Oh, back you come.
Tell you what, you were doing two at once, but you've kept Gracey and Gillian.
So I'm a salesman, pitch to me why you should go on a date with me.
Good answer, good answer.
Before you decide, there's something you should know.
One of these girls is on first-name terms at a local chicken shop.
(WHISTLES) Will it be Gracey or Gillian?
(SHOUTS OF ENCOURAGEMENT)
Come in here.
Gillian is on first-name terms at the chicken shop. (LAUGHTER)
Before you go to Fernando's, Johnny did his Love At First Light.
Yeah, we're doing it.
You're off on your date.
When you get to the beach, you'll want to get 'em off.
# I'll make you fall in love
# For a spell that can't be broken
# One drop should be enough
# Boy, you belong to me
# I got the recipe
I'd love to share a bottle of red wine with her.
The next lad comes with a 10,000 miles' service.
While he revs up, let's see if there were any cheeky kisses for Shelley and Dathan in Fernando's.
I'm feeling excited, nervous as well.
I don't want to scare him and go, "I want to get married,"
You do seem quite mature.
That makes me feel really old.
What we're going to do is Zumba.
(BOTH CHUCKLE) The more I get to know her, the more I'm attracted.
OK, let's go!
I didn't know my left from my right, I don't think Dathan did, either.
It was a mixture of bad coordination and dancing awkwardly.
Cheers.
You're genuinely a person I'd like to take on a second date, because I think we could have something special.
He comes across as being so into me it's really flattering.
Would you like to go on a second date?
I'm looking forward to a second date with Shelley.
I haven't had a date like that before.
I'll definitely see Dathan again, 100%.
Think you might have a keeper here, Shelley.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
The next lad's just upstairs shaving.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Women are from Venus, men are from Mars, but hunks are from the Lovely.
Let's see if Nicola and Scott got frisky in Fernando's.
I'm massively looking forward to it.
Why did you keep your light on?
I loved the fact that it wasn't just classic, the standard song.
She's just as hot as I remember, maybe hotter.
I'm going to be 25 in a couple of weeks.
I love my family, I spend so much time with them.
It's the only thing that could jeopardise another date.
Let's go!
(HALF SCREAMS)
Just sea air, fast, bit of hugging as well.
I do really like him, but I see him maybe more as a friend.
If she feels the same connection I felt today then it's game on.
Are you sure?
Perfect setting, Champagne, beautiful girl - boom!
I think you're such a lovely guy.
When I set out to find someone, I wanted someone family-orientated.
She's given me the wrong vibe all day.
(APPLAUSE) Let's try another.
(LAUGHTER)
# I'm a rock'n'roll star #
# I could be the one to make you feel that way
# I could be the one to set you free
(AUDIENCE CLAPS TO THE RHYTHM)
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
# I could be the one to make you feel that way
# I could be the one to set you free #
Just write me down your Love At First Light.
I'm loving the shirt, but I can't work out what colour it is.
Phwoar!
I am quite small, but when we're lying on the beach it won't matter.
The Pompey lad's made light work of round one, but will the girls leave Declan dangling when we delve deeper?
If he's your lad, don't turn things bad.
I'm a young Pompey lad looking for his first taste of love.
I'm a professional BMX rider.
I've been competing since I was 16 and am ranked seventh in the world.
It's dangerous, I've broken ten bones in three years.
Staying in shape is a big thing, so I do 50 press-ups every night.
When not riding, I'm helping Mum with her afternoon tea business.
I butter the bread and the grannies love my cucumber sandwiches.
My son knows how to butter them up, but you can't have tea for two when you're single, so girls, help him out.
Don't panic if I don't call you back, I'm always losing my phone.
Because my pockets are too tight it pops out.
That's what happens when you wear girls' jeans.
How am I going to contact you?
To be honest, I'm not the best at sports and that.
When I'm watching I'm thinking it's amazing.
You could be Luke Skywalker, carry me on your back like Yoda.
(LAUGHTER) Where's that come from?
If you get through this next round you've got yourself a date.
You never know what might happen on a night out with Declan.
How do you lose your shoes?
It took him seven hours to walk eight miles home.
At least you know he'll go the distance on a date. (APPLAUSE)
Congratulations, Declan, you've got yourself a date!
Well done.
In a past life, that would've concerned me, but I'm a changed woman and I'm very open-minded and I wouldn't be concerned being out on a night like that.
(LAUGHTER) I'm going to get you on this flight ASAP.
Congratulations, you've made it to the final round.
Now the power's in your hands.
(SHOUTS OF ENCOURAGEMENT)
Shauney's gone.
Luarna.
Keep going, Declan.
He doesn't know what to do.
One more girl, Declan.
Sorry.
What category would you go for gold in and why?
Before you make your mind up, there's something you should know.
One of the two is so obsessed with Simon Cowell,... (LAUGHTER)
(SHOUTS OF ENCOURAGEMENT)
What's he going to do?
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) It's Rebecca!
Declan's Love At First Light was...
Yes!
I'm sending you both off to Fernando's!
# Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
# But here's my number
# So call me, maybe
# And all the other boys
# Try to chase me... #
I fancy Rebecca, a strong nine out of ten.
I really like him, I think he could be boyfriend material.
He's definitely my type and it feels amazing!
(CHEERING) Get ready, girls.
This next fella's got animal magnetism - stick him to the fridge!
See you in a bauble.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Let's see if Katy-Jay and Nick hit it off on the Isle of F.
I'm nervous about the date.
When I first saw Nick, I was pleasantly surprised.
When I saw the camels, getting a selfie, the camel head-butted him, full-on.
It bit him. (CHUCKLES)
I'm just hanging over a cliff.
I'm looking forward to seeing if it's going to work out.
When Nick first walked in to dinner,
I was really disappointed.
..and the same jeans from the camel ride.
(BURPS) Sorry. (LAUGHTER)
So he burped when we sat mid-meal and he is belching so loud.
Want to see each other again?
Erm, I think on a friend level.
Well, you missed a patch on your legs when you shaved, so...
Nick finally realised I was really upset towards the end of the date.
He felt uncomfortable and awkward, but it was too late, I was gone.
I didn't mean to, but I'm not really bothered.
I mean, you never know which way these things are going to go, do ya?
That date was difficult to digest.
Katy-Jay, you had a close shave.
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER)
Let the Dumble see the dore.
(LAUGHTER)
# Baby, here I am, I'm the man on the scene
# I can give you what you want, but you've got to come home with me
# Boys come along a dime by the dozen
# That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
# Hey, little thing, let me light your candle
# Cos, mama, I'm sure hard to handle, yes, I am
# Oh
# Hard to handle now
# Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... #
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Write me down your Love At First Light.
There we are.
Gracey, why did you turn off?
I have a whole collection, I could've shown you the rest.
(NORTHERN IRISH ACCENT) You're lookin' swell tonight.
He reminds me of Dopey off Snow White. (LAUGHTER)
And you clearly like that kind of thing.
Take all compliments on the show.
(LAUGHTER) He's just got a flat cap on.
Our boy from Belfast has Gee whizzed through round one.
Will the girls be as keen when they find out what's under his hat?
If you like Gee, leave that light be.
One thing gives me confidence - hats.
I love wearing them, it's a great way to get attention.
Girls always want to steal them.
I'm talented at making sweet music.
We all play ukulele.
(ALL SING)
I started learning while I was travelling and I haven't stopped.
Meeting Miss Right is tough when your best friend is Mr Northern Ireland.
Gee would make a great boyfriend and make a girl feel like Miss World.
Gee, you would completely ruin my street cred, the hat business.
Who wouldn't want to go out with a pirate who plays ukulele?
(LAUGHTER) OK.
Get through this next round, you've got yourself a date.
If he makes it through this round, it'll be music to his ears.
If he can impress our girls, he'll ride the waves of love to Fernando's.
(HAWAII FIVE-0 THEME TUNE)
(CHEERING)
(ALL CLAP TO THE RHYTHM)
Yeah!
You can relax now, because the power's now in your hands.
You've got to turn two lights off.
(SHOUTS OF ENCOURAGEMENT)
Two girls.
One more girl.
"Get off!" Ask 'em a question.
You've seen I love dressing up.
I'd dress up as a lifeguard, to give you the kiss of life in Fernando's.
Before you make your mind up, there's something you should know.
The ex-boyfriend of one got her that upset she put triple extra-hot chillies in his meal to get back at him.
(SHOUTS OF ENCOURAGEMENT)
(CHEERING) Oh!
Over you come, Mimi.
Oh, wow!
I can tell you it was Becky with the chillies.
(CHEERING)
Gee's Love At First Light was...
Oh!
It's all right.
Tell the hotel manager I sent you.
You can't miss him, his photo's on the wall.
# Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
# Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
# And wouldn't it be nice to live together
# In the kind of world where we belong?
# You know, it's going to make it that much better... #
I wouldn't say I fancy him, but he's got a great personality.
The dating action gets peachier.
Catch up with last week's couples on Take Me Out The Gossip with Mark Wright and Laura Jackson on ITV2 tomorrow night at nine.
They've had a date in the sun and now are ready for an evening of fun.
Join us tomorrow. 9pm on ITV2.
That's your Sunday night sorted.
Until next time, it's lights out, all out. (CHEERING)
