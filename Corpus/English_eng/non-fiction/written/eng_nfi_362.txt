- Previously on The Last Man on Earth...

I haven't had any pregnancy symptoms.
What if something's really wrong?
Can you tell us your name?
I'm starting to wonder if he's ever gonna talk.
She's kind of in a foggy stage.
I've been having to guess on her dosage.
The big day.
The big day.
You excited?
I'm so happy.
Oh, yeah, I am, too.
What are you thinking about?
Someone very special to me.
I wonder who that could be.
Oh, Gail, you're my rock.
And you're my roll.
Jasper?
Jasper?
I'm in here.
Are you freaking kidding me right now?
No way.
What?
I have been waiting for this moment for so long, and it finally came.
What are you all hyped up about?

No, this is a very big deal.
Do you know how long you've been promising me you'd paint my go-kart pink for breast cancer awareness?
Thank you.
Jasper... what do we say when someone says thank you?
- You're welcome.

Jasper, thank you very much for saying you're welcome.
You're welcome.
Thank you for that one, too.
Jasper.
You're welcome.
Hey.
Let's go get ready for the big day, huh?
Okay.
Okay, let's see what we got here.
Oh, those have not come back yet.
No?
Oh, no.

Maybe we just need to let 'em get a little air for a while.
Okay, yeah.
Okay.
Well, should we get going?
Yeah, don't want to be late for the big day, huh?
Will you help me up?
Yeah.

Pretty ugly spot for a wedding, huh?
First of all, I'd like to commend the bridal party for the choice to all wear wedding dresses.
Just beautiful.
And I mean, we all know who's getting married, so that was not confusing at all.

Melissa, Todd, we just heard a beautiful rendition of your coitus anthem,
"She Drives Me Crazy."
And now, you are uniting your souls, much the same way you did your penis and vagina so many times to that beautiful song.
And now, that song has taken on a whole new meaning, when the bride went medically crazy after killing a man she did not know.
But that was the past.
And this is the future.
Look how far we've come, huh?
The last six months have been, by far, the most interesting that we've all shared.
A real roller coaster.
So many powerful moments... too many to go into detail, you know.
And we were all there anyway, so, you know, what's the frickin' point, yeah?
But, uh, bottom line, we're stronger than ever.

Let's get to the vows.
Melissa, would you like to go first?
Todd, you are my savior.
And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.
Thank you.
- Is that it?

Perfect.
Uh, Todd, uh, wishing he didn't have to go second here, huh?
Great job.
Melissa... you're my home.
As you all know,
I went through the legal and spiritual steps to reclaim my virginity.
Today I wear white as a symbol of the three months of abstinence we observed as a couple.
And the two months I observed as an individual.
I stand before you pure as the driven snow.
I worship at your altar, drinking in your spirit.
Jasper, do you have the rings?
Uh, uh, Jasper, don't you have something you want to say?
Here are two rings around the rosie.
Uh, uh, Jasper?
Boom.
I taught him that.

Jasper, what do we say when somebody...
Thank you!
The ring.
It is round like the sun, the moon, and, of course, the woman's cervix.
The cervix is heavily on my mind these days, as I'm about to deliver our child from Carol's gorgeous womb.
And Carol and I couldn't be more happy about it.
We are both so excited about it.
I'm reminded of the words of Jeopardy!

- Wh...

I do, too.

Going straight into the kiss now.
Um, Uh, I have a statement to...
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. and Mrs. Chartres-Rodriguez!

Release the crickets!
- Ho!

Oh, wh...

It's a symbol of peace.
Carol.
So you still haven't told him?
Well, we had a talk about it.
- Oh, yeah?

And what did you say?
Uh, um, I, well...
Oh, right.

And he said, "Yes?"
And then that's as far as we got.
You have to tell him I'm delivering the baby.
The only thing that man is qualified to deliver is rancid farts.
But he's been studying so hard.
He wrote whole rap about the stages of labor.
It's very good.
- Do you want to hear it?

♪ In active labor, what you gonna do?

♪ I'm gonna put on my runnin' shoes. ♪
His plan is to put on shoes?
'Cause my plan is to monitor the fetal heartbeat, time your contractions, and measure your dilation.
So you're not gonna wear shoes?
I'm gonna wear friggin' shoes.
Carol, do you still want me to deliver this baby?
Of course.

You just do it.
Yeah.

Yeah, just do it.
- Yeah.

- Okay.

Unique New York.
Red leather, yellow leather.

- Tandy?

Remember last month when I said "Tandy"
and you said, "Yes?"
- Of course.

W...

I was about to say a few words.
Yeah.
Thank you.

Gather around, please.
And bring your glasses.
I'd like to make a toaster strudel, if I may.
Todd, Melissa, I just want to say
I-I'm so happy for you guys.

You faced some tough times... we all have.
My parents... they never expected much from me.
And, to be honest, they never got it, you know?
But, uh...
God, if they could see me now, huh?
You know, delivering my own baby.
An OB-GIN.
Friggin' doctor in the family.
Mom, Dad, I did good.
I did good.
To Tandy.
- To Tandy.

Did we just toast to Tandy
- at our wedding?

So what did you-what did you want to say?
I have diarrhea.
Oh.
When it rains, it pours.
You know what that means.
Aw, do we have to?
This is so nice.

It's great.

What's the rush?
I want to go have sex.

Hon, look, we waited this long.

Yeah, in the closet.

Not again.
Okay, let's go.
Look, my first time is not gonna be in some dirty closet.
Oh, my God, Todd, are you trying to make me insane again?
Tandy!
You ever had a spoon up your butt?
No.
Look, let's just take a deep breath, okay?
Enjoy the reception, and then I'll give you a night to remember.
Fine, let's do the reception.

So, did you do it?
Yeah.
Oh, Lord, Carol.
I know you're in a tough position, but this has got to be done.
His parents are so proud.

Just blame it all on me;

No.
He's my husband and I'm his wife.
This has to come from me.
So, this just in.
Gail forbids you from delivering our baby, and she's being a massive "B" about it.
What?
Why?
She just put her foot down and said she's gonna be my doctor, and there's nothing I can do about it.
But I'm ready for this.
I know!

But she was just like...
But this is my child!
That's what I said, but even more emphatically.
But, yeah, apparently this is just what's happening now.
This is the new normal.
And the sad thing is
I know you would have done a better job.
And I've said that publicly to a bunch of people.
Go around and ask.
No.

I am delivering this baby!
Go ahead.
Finish the job.
Carol sell me out?
I pleaded with her not to do it, but you know her, always telling the truth.
Yeah.

You should try it sometime.
How about right now?
You're not good at most things.
Name one.
Math, jokes, basic hygiene, ideas, knowing what others think about you.
You named five... fail.
Name's Gail.

Sometimes I get my "F"s and my "G"s mixed up.
So why don't you fo guck yourselg.
No matter how much Carol protests, you are not delivering this baby.
You've never seen me in an operating room, but I've seen you in one, and it did not go well.
That was low.
I have spent every day of the past six months preparing for that birth.
I'm ready.
- You think so?

And I'm gonna prove it to you.
Gail.
Tandy.
What a glorious opportunity for rebirth.
God, I'm so happy that my second first time's gonna be so special.
You know, 'cause m-my first-first time was not.
Her name was Tanya.
She was incredibly alluring, but the mental side was just not there.
I mean, the physical side was so there.
You know, it was electric.
We would glide effortlessly from position to position, you know, matching each other orgasm for orgasm.
Todd, I've hung in there as long as I could.

Be gentle with me.
God, I hope I remember how to do it.
I'm so scared.
Guys!

- Please, follow me!

No, guys, come on!

Tandy, is it more important than me losing my virginity?
1,000%, bud.
Well, well, well.
Thank you all for coming.
As usual, I'll be brief.
No, you won't.
Now, it's come to my attention that, uh, some people in this, uh some people in this, uh...
It's come to my attention that some people in this room do not believe in my skills as an obstetrician.
Just say "Gail," dummy.
Okay.
Gail-dummy does not want me to deliver my own child.
Yeah, that's the right call;

Let's go.
Okay.

I'm-I'm cool with whatever the group decides.
Thank you, Todd.
And I hope Gail is, too.
Now I have prepared a series of demonstrations.
The first of which will highlight my hygiene, which some have wrongly hinted may be a concern.
It was me, and I flat-out said it.
Well, allow me to assuage your fears.
In my hands are gloves, but within a matter of seconds, in these gloves will be hands.
Carol, start the timer.
Oh, okay.
Okay, go!
Time.

Uh, 15 seconds.
Kind of a lobster claw thing happening.
I don't need all my fingers to deliver a baby.
The point is cleanliness, sterility, hygiene.
Demonstration number two.
Some people in this room...
Again, just say me.
...have wrongly labeled me a klutz.
What?

'Cause the only place I'm gonna drop this baby is off at college.
The delivery.
Carol, would you please do the honors?
It's a simple switch on the side of the machine.
- Okay.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

Oh!

Oh, I already asked for the machine to be turned off, so that one does not count.
That doesn't prove smack, Tandy.
Delivering a child requires actual skills, or somebody's gonna get hurt.
Which leads me to demonstration number three.
Now, before me is a baby doll baked into Jell-O.
The doll represents our baby, and the Jell-O represents
Carol's delicate womb structures.
Carol, does that look about right to you?
Yeah.
And, Gail, would you like to taste the Jell-O to make sure that it's actual Jell-O?
I'm good.
So, in this demo,
I'm going to prove that I'm capable of safely delivering this baby doll with exactly zero damage to this metorical womb.
Behold.
Gently entering the Jell-O canal.
How's this feeling, Carol?
Fine.
Okay, good.
I'm tugging on it a little bit.
It's a very tight seal.

I do squeezers.
Okay.
I can tell.
Note that the Jell-O is still fully intact.
No.

Just normal fissures.
Uh, those will heal.
The amniotic sac is known to have a natural give.
Ooh, there's a lot of cracks there, Tandy.
I heard you the first time, Gail!

This one looks like the winter is coming.

Oh, no, no.

Oh, good God.
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Oh!

It's a girl.

Okay...

Slippery little sucker, huh?
Oh, God.
Well, anyway, there you have it.
A healthy baby.
Demonstration over.

No.

Isn't that right, Carol?
No.

No.

No, Tandy.
Wait.

I think one "no" will suffice.
You friggin' nimwood.
It's not me she's saying no to, it's you.
What are you talking about?
Carol is scared to tell you that she wants me to deliver the baby.
Care Bear?
Tandy?
Yeah?
Tandy, are you in here?
No.
Can I talk to you?
What?
I am so sorry.
Why didn't you just tell me?
I've been trying to for a long time, but I knew how important it was for you to make your dead parents proud.
Carol, it's not just that.
Then what is it?
I just remember Phil on that operating table.
Watching Gail and Todd in there and not being able to do anything about it.
I've never felt more helpless.
And I loved Phil, but you're the most important person in my life.
A-And it's gonna be hard to just sit in there and do nothing.
You won't be doing nothing.
You have the most important responsibility of all.
You have to hold my hand.
Hey, Mom.
Darling son.
I-I just wanted to say no hard feelings.
Fine.
Look, I'm-I'm sorry about the Phil thing.
There was nothing you could have done.
Nobody could have.
And when it comes down to it,
I wouldn't want anybody else to deliver our baby.
Thanks, Tandy.
You know, I can't do this all alone.
I'm gonna need a good copilot in there.
Gail, I would be honored to be your copilot...
I've asked Todd.
Good call, yeah.

But Todd is gonna need a flight attendant.
And that would b-b...
That would be me?
That would be you.
I'll think about it.
Yeah!

I would love to, actually.
That's great, thank you.
Guys, we have a situation.
What is it?
My water broke.
Oh, farts.
