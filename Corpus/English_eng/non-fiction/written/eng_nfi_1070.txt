Alvey's in Tucson.
His mother tried to kill herself.
The woman never had an interest in living.
Someone really wants to die, you... you can't get 'em off it, you know?
I'm so sorry about the other day.
I'm a fucking nut case.
Yeah, well, I, too, suffer that affliction.
You latched onto Ryan like a fucking leech.
You're fired.
What the fuck is up with her?
Kayla.

No room for a lazy bitch.
You're the boss, Cody.

I don't know how things were with Terry, but I don't like your fucking tone.
You have to move out.

I want us to communicate more.
Talk.

No, not tonight, you fucking smartass.
I mean in general, you know.
Amy loved you.
She loved you once, she can love you again.
You got all the fucking tools, my man.
If you were good enough to be my coach, you'd be my coach, but you're not.
I found this in my bag.
Thought you didn't have it.
Sometimes I lie.
Okay.
Yeah?
I'm up.
Hit.
Cut.

Cut.
Hello.

Hands up!
Sink it!
Nice.

- Good?

The fuck is that?
You're gonna record this?
Is that a... problem?
Yeah.
I don't like reporters, man.
Thanks, man.

I gotta protect myself, you know, my career.
They're gonna fucking trash me, so I just...
I want my story out there, too.
I think that's smart.
You gonna talk?
You ask me a question.
All right...
When did you feel things started to go bad for you at Navy Street?
When I got involved with Lisa.
You care to be more specific?
When I started fucking Lisa.
You know?

It's, like, her thing, you know.
"It's her thing." What does that mean?
Alvey.

I didn't know...

I didn't know about that.
But she that type of woman.
She liked the attention.
I've known Lisa for years, and I've never gotten that impression.
Right, but that's because you don't see that side of her.
You know what I mean?

She makes you believe what she wants.
Alvey don't even know.
She making him look like a dummy.
What about Ryan Wheeler?
What about him?
He seems to be in hiding ever since the home invasion incident.
Right.
Ryan's a broken person.
He's fuckin' loyal as hell, but he's troubled.
I personally think he's too fucked up in the head to... to keep on fighting.
Fucked up how?
He hates himself.
Selfdestructive.
He's expressed this to you?
Yeah.

We were... we were close, man.
I mean, he would come to me as a... as a coach and... and as a fighter, and we would talk.
And then III'd share my feelings with him, too, you know.
That's the real reason why we... why I got fired, because of my relationship with Ryan.
And that... fucking cunt turned him against me.
Why?
He's their top fighter, right?
They're afraid that I'm gonna take him,
I'm gonna poach him, you know, and bring him to a different gym.
What kinds of things would you talk about with Ryan?
Talk about everything.
Talk about God, and we talk about his... his father.
Him being lonely.

Ryan... he ain't got no family.
So when you're a fighter and you got nothing real in your life, it's... it's fucking hard, man.
Who's gonna give a shit about you when you start losing?
Ryan's got good people in his life.
He's been with Lisa and Alvey for years.
Are you fucking kidding me?
I had my car for years.
When that motherfucker breaks down, I'm getting rid of it.
Right?
Ryan understands that.
He's a commodity.
We all are.
Hardest thing every fighter learns.
You fuckers killed me.
Well, there were two of us.
I feel like there was five of you.
How's your back feeling?

I'll tell you when the drugs wear off.
So, what is the plan for the rest of the day?
The plan is to get something to eat and then go to the hospital, which you guys don't have to come to.
We can.
I don't want to embarrass her.
If there's anything that she needs done around the house, we can handle it.
Right.

I mean just get some rest.
I wanna come back and train later.
Did you hear what I said?
Do you wanna go?
I'm talking to you.
No, no!

Don't!

Don't.

You know, I adopted you.
Ambrosia?
You have a guest.
- Fuck.

You know what you want for lunch yet?
I want chicken teriyaki and then the two California rolls.
And then get me the, ice cream balls.
- Mochi.

Mochi.

- I got it.

- She's new.

Let me tell you something about that girl.
I had a mole behind my ear.
- I don't wanna hear it.

I didn't even see it.

She sent me to the dermatologist.
Turned out it was the bad kind.

That woman is a rock star and she's a notary.
Sweet.


Cost me a fortune.
Have a seat.

Alvey and Ryan are fine.
That's what I like to hear.
You know that guy?
Yeah.
He works for the fund that bought you out.
Yeah.

Great guy.

Yeah, we met.

I said no.
He keeps calling.
You're being pushed out.
Shit.
Tossed in the wood chipper.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
Sometimes even the horse with the biggest cock gets put out to pasture, you know?
You know... if I wanted control, I wouldn't have sold.
But I did and I'm rich.
You know what my father used to say to me when I was a child?
No.
Nothing.

That's the shit I come from.

You should take this job.
Yeah, come on, Lisa.
I mean, that's the real reason you came here.
- You want this job.

- How much they offer you?

- And what are you making now?

My God.

You fucking white American motherfuckers.
You know it's more complicated than that.
Why?

Because of my fighters.
- Who, Ryan?

Yeah?

They'll all fucking leave you.
And I own part of the gym.
You pay your rent, that's it.
It's always be Alvey's gym, his way.
I love him, but, you know, he needs you more than you need him.
You have my blessing.
At least have the conversation with them.
The boss.
- No.

- No!

I'm doing press for the fight.

I'm writing a story.
Wanna give you a chance to comment.
No comment.
I sat down with Dominick Ramos.

Like what?
Sit down with me, and I'll tell you.
You're gonna wanna get your side out there.
Meet me in the lounge.
Jay!
Open the door.
Come on, wait.
What are you doing?

- No.

Well...
I was, um... trying to commit suicide.
- Not funny yet?

My poop was taking longer than I expected, if you must know.
I'm about to jump in right now.
Well, hurry up.

You know what I can do, Nate?
I could plug up the bathtub.
Then you could... you could bathe in my runoff.
Sounds good.
Love you.
Jesus Christ.
Hey, Amy.

Um...

II know it's none of my business, um...
But if you could call my brother back, that'd be great.
Um...
Everything's fine.

Um, if you... if you can.

Um...
Okay, well, love to Maya, and I hope you're well.
All right, bye.
It wasn't a message.

I wanted you to have 'em.
Alvey, II don't want you to feel you... you're not here for me.
How long have you been planning this?
Not... no set day.
I just woke up that morning and I...
That was it.

I found the note that you left me.
Maybe you should throw it away.
No.
I am not throwing it away.
Then frame it.
Jesus Christ, Ma.

I'm happy to see you.
You look so handsome.
You're happy?
You're happy to see me, but you won't even try.
I've been trying for 70 years.
You're depressed.
You've been depressed.

I know.
- You know?

You know that I have it?
Yeah.
I struggle.

Want to put a gun in my mouth.
But I take a pill, Ma.
I take a pill.

I feel okay.
Why won't you try that?
Why won't you try?
Actually, I was talking to, Doctor... what's her name?
- Robinson.

She said that the newer medications are not so... the side effects, they're not so horrible.
No, they're not.

No side effects.

But you... you gotta stick with it, though.
It takes a little bit of time.

That's what she said.

- Yeah.

You can.

Ma, you could do this.

Come to L.A. and stay with me, okay?
You'd see the boys.

It'll be good.

- No.

No, I can't.

You sure?
Yeah, I can't.
Okay.

Okay.
You know what you could do for me?
What?
Could you get me something to eat?
I can't eat in here.

All right, what do you want?

- Hamburger.

Yeah.
Okay.

I'm gonna get it for you.

When you come back, we're gonna talk about my grandsons?
Yeah.

All right, I'll be right back.

Yeah.

No, we weren't friends, and he sure as shit wasn't my coach, dude.
Did he tell you he got fired?
Yeah.

- Yeah.

He was here, now he's gone.

Well, he said it was personal, that you forced him out because he was sleeping with Lisa.
That's bullshit.
So he and Lisa weren't... involved?
Don't fucking know.

Yeah, see, I don't believe that.
I know how fighters are with this kind of thing.
It's like he has something over you now.
Does Alvey know about it?
Ask him.
Yeah, I'd rather not.
No, he said that you guys had...

Look, man, I don't wanna talk about this shit.

For the record... he was never my coach, never my friend.
He was a journeyman coach who couldn't cut it.
That's my statement.
He told me you were having a hard time.
I'm training for a fucking fight, man.
I mean, it's a grind, but I'm...

In your personal life.
Nearly beating that kid to death.
Leonard Schaffer.
- He was in my home.

I spoke to the police.

But... you know, given your history, the injuries that your father suffered at your hand,
IIII could imagine how this might weigh on you.
Lisa was clear that I wasn't gonna talk about this stuff.
I need you to respect that.
Off the record?
I just wanna know what you're going through.
It's a very human story.
Okay, let me...

You need to stop.
Thanks, man.
Thanks.
- Hey.

Burger.
Well done.
No tomato.
And a, a chocolate shake, please.
Anything else?
No, that's it.
- Name?

- What?

Spell it.
Joe.
I have to fucking spell it.
Hello?
Yep, this is Alvey.
Yeah, she's my mother.
I'm...

I'm on my way back to the hospital right now.
What do you mean she doesn't want to see me?
I just came to get her something to eat.

Well...
Let me just talk...

Just put her on the phone.
Come on.
Well, listen to me.

Whoever does the evaluation, you gotta know my mother is just... she's full of shit.

Soon as you let her go, she's gonna try it again.
No, two weeks isn't long enough.

Can you... can you...

Can you keep her longer?
Christ.
No.
Well, can... can you at least...

Please?
Yeah, this number.
Alvey.
Thank you.
Order for Joe.
Fuck it.
Hey.

What's happening?
I thought we were gonna train later.
Listen, I want you to change the flights to tomorrow morning.

What happened?
If you can't change the flights, we're gonna drive the rental back.
Hi.
What?
Mario Goldsmith was here.
I told that little shit no interviews.
He talked to Dom.
What'd he say?
That you fucked him.
Jesus Christ.
Fuck.
- Who... who are you calling?

I'm telling him to kill the story.
Mario, it's Lisa Prince.
I don't know what story you think you fucking have, but you're gonna kill it.

Um...
Maybe if you fuck him, then he won't run it.
'Cause... that's what you do.
I do?

Well, see, you got it backwards, you know?
You're supposed to fuck your way to the top, not the bottom.
Hey, maybe if you fuck Garo, you could be a ring girl.
How about that?
You're being such an asshole.
How you gonna walk into a room and represent me when every promoter in this town knows you fucked some secondtier dirtbag in the parking lot of the gym?
That's my business.
No, forget... forget about me.
How could you disrespect Alvey like that?
He gave you part of his gym.
Fuck you.

Yeah, I guess now we know how.
Okay.
You're right, Ryan.

I don't deserve any of this.

Actually, no, it makes me feel like a fucking idiot.
At least now I know.
Come on, let's go grab a couple drinks.
Where we gonna drink in Tucson?
We'll find a spot.
Come on.

Cowboy Palace.
This place looks terrible.
When one travels, sonny boy, you must immerse yourself in the culture and get fucked up.
I.D.s, gentlemen.
Thank you, sir.
These clowns are my sons.
I.D., please.
He's got a gun.

- Sir, what's your name again?

- That's right.

I used to work a door, so I appreciate your service and rigid adherence to protocol.
You gotta card everybody, even the elderly.
Before we go in, I got a quick question.
I plan on taking home a woman this evening.
Is there anybody I should not approach so as to avoid crossing a local?
- Just don't cause any shit.

I will not be causing any shit.

No shit.

Shitcausing sons of bitches.
This is Mario.
Hey, what's up, brother?
It's me.

Hey, what's up?
I'm not...
I'm not catching you at a bad time, am I?
Just picking up my dog's shit.

Yeah.
You... you remember the conversation we had?
You know, what I...

I...

I don't want people to think I'm a... that I got an ax to grind with him, you know?
Okay.
Yeah.
I shouldn't have been talking out... out my mouth that way to you.

I mean, it's like, it...

Well, I think it's pretty clear that you care about Ryan and his wellbeing.
I do, man.
I got love...

I know.
II feel like I can help him.
You know, we... we were putting together a good training camp.
And then, um... the fucking politics.
It all fucking started, you know?
Yeah, man, it's Navy Street.
No shit.

I'm wondering if you could do me a favor and just... just bury all the shit I told you.
I'm confused.
You reached out to me.

I was...

I was really angry and...
Ryan is a good dude, man.
And I just don't wanna put any of his shit out there, you know?
Yeah, the problem is, I've already talked to him.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck!
What'd he say?
Well, he says you're full of shit, but I found you very credible.
You print any of that fucking story,
I deny every fucking word.

Cool, man.
I mean, it's all recorded, but go for it.
Next time, call your shrink, not a journalist.
Fuck you, motherfucker!

Come on.

I mean, you know what I just benched last?
- Dumbbells?

Why do you have to always beat me with...
There's my girl.

Thank you.
Listen, I want you to do me a favor and keep an eye on the three of us, okay?
I never want this bottle to be more than halfway empty.
And kind of these shots coming.
We got fucking memories we wanna kill.
Can I have a water, too, please?
No!

He's fine.

- Okay, no water.

- What a great ass.

That's a rude thing to say.
It is a great ass.

Hold on, motherfucker.

Are we gonna do this every time?
Yeah, we're gonna do this every time.
You guys are gonna sit here and listen to this.
You know why?

You're a fuck, man.
What?
II thought...

You're... you're a cunt.
There you go.
That's when you know the toast is over, when your old man calls you a cunt.
Stop.

I'm just playing.

I'm just fucking with you.

All right, you enjoy fucking with me.
I need to spend some time with a woman.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
What woman?
The fuck is wrong with him now?
He's a moody fuck, man.
He's... he's like your mother.
You're gonna go against me now, too?
Nobody's going against you.
Nobody's going against you.
I'll...

I'll wreck the whole place.
What were you gonna say before?
I'm glad you're here with me.
Yeah.
Ma'am, are you drinking alone?
Yeah.
I'm Jay.
Luanne.
Man, Luanne in a cowboy bar.
That's... that's beautiful.
That's beautiful.

Luanne, would it be all right if I bought your drinks tonight?
Well, I drink free here, so that's not really that impressive.
Well, even better.
- Yeah.

I could use the peace and quiet.
You used to wrestle?
You got the ears.
Yes.

A fighter.
Then what do you do now?
Now?
I'm a philanthropist.
A philanthropist?

Well, what's your cause, Mr. Philanthropist?
Several.
Yes, the ocean...

- Wow.

They're all very worthy.
Indeed.
Cheers.
Luanne... when you first saw my ears,
what did you think of me?
I thought you wrestled.
My brother has the same ears.
Do they bother you?
Why would your ears bother me?
Could you fall in love with a man who had ears like mine?
My husband lost his left leg below the knee.
Um, you're not married anymore?
No.

Because of his leg?
'Cause he wouldn't stop apologizing for it.
Hello?
You should know that
I'm picking up my daughter from Taekwondo right now, so if you're gonna rip me a new asshole, please do it before she gets in the car.
You're not running that fucking story.
Which one?
The you and Dominick sex scandal, or the one about your top fighter's PTSD?
Both.
I gotta write about something.
That guy's a mess, by the way.

Mario, I'm telling you, do not fuck me on this.
What other choice do I have?
You won't make Ryan available to me.
Mario, trust me, I've tried.

All right, then I gotta write about you and Dom's relationship.
There's no fucking relationship!
Well, whatever it is, I'm gonna ask Alvey to comment on it.
And doesn't sound like he knows anything about it, so thank you for turning me into a tabloid writer.
I'll give you something else.
Do I get an exclusive?
Yes.
I'm listening.
I'm gonna leave Navy Street to run King Beast.
Fuck me.

Garo's out.

Okay.

So you're killing the Dom story, yeah?
Dead.

Still gonna hound you about Ryan, but this is important.
It takes a lot for a woman to rise in this sport.
And, you know, I'm, I'm happy.
I'm...

Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
I think I...

You... are a very beautiful woman, Luanne.
I could use a woman like you...
Is that right?
Luanne.

And, um... tell me, how exactly would you like to use me?
Well, I need my ass kicked in a very specific way, and I can't seem to find a woman who can do it just right.
Either kill me or they can't hardly leave a scratch.
Well, you see, the trick is, Jay... you gotta thread the needle.
You know what I'm sayin'?
I mean, you break a man, he's useless.
That's exactly fucking right.
You know things, Luanne.
I do.
- Yes, Ma'am.

- Let's dance.

I'm not dancing with you.

That's right.

But I have this feeling that you could make me a man.
Is that right?
Yes, indeed.
Why don't you come dance with me?
All right, well, why don't you buy me one more drink, and we'll see?
Bartender?
Could we have one or two more of those?
Una mas.
Hey.
The fuck?
Sorry.

What are you doing here?
Can we go to your office?
- No.

I know you've been talking to Mario...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

No, no, no.

- Hey, Dom!

No, no, no, that's exactly what you...
- Hey.

Dude, Mario totally fucked me, bro.
Fuck!

Motherfuck!

Something just happened.

Fuck!

Fucking... fuck.
Look at him.

He's a fucking savage.
He broke her fucking will, man.
30 minutes ago, she wouldn't talk to him.
He's relentless.
He was like that when he was a kid.
I'd say, "Jay, don't jump on the bed,"
he would go jump off the roof.
That's the way he fights, too.
We all do.
We gotta work with him, though, man.
I want...

Me, too.
Yeah.
Promise me you'll help me with that, all right?
I will.

'Cause he's on edge.

It's just the way he's wired.
If he loses hope, I'm afraid...
You see what... what... what shit we deal with in our family.
I...
You got no problems, right?
No.
Yeah?
'Cause you, my friend, are on a fucking roll, man.
You are.
I mean, III was wrong.

Not only are you a real fighter, you're gonna be a great fucking fighter, okay?
- I am proud of you, man.

Come on.

Look at me.
We gotta stick together.
We've got to stick together.
Women and fucking friends...

In the grand scheme of things, they don't mean a fucking thing.
Do you understand?
You stay close to me.

My mother wrote one note, Nate.

No one else left.
That's it.
Um...

I will, but I think you need to call him tomorrow morning.
Yeah.
I'll try and get an advance for your next fight.
No, don't worry about it.

Lisa, I didn't mean what I said.
I think you did.
I'm just kind of... fucked up right now.
Were you better before?
He's just beneath you.

Don't forget your pills.
I mean...
Dom told me I had power.
Yeah.
Whoo!
I'm gay.
I'm gay.
Shut the fuck...

I'm gay.
Shut the fuck up with that, okay?

What...
Are you fucking kidding me right now?
No.
Hey.
You're not fucking gay.
What are you doing?

I'm gay.
I'm gay.
Your son's gay.
Are you really gonna fucking do this right now?
What... what the fuck am I doing?
My fucking mother is in the hospital.
She's fucking killed herself almost.
You're gonna tell me you're a fucking faggot?
Nate!
- Hey, Nate.

- Nate.

- Nate!

- I got you.

- I got it.

What the fuck...

- Hey!

- Hey!

- Fuck you!

Fuck you, you piece of shit!
- Hey.

Relax or I'm calling the cops!
- Relax.

You got something to say to me?

- He's drunk.

What the fuck is wrong with you?

- Fucking pussy!

- Did you know about this?

- Did you know about this?

- Did you fucking know?

He's telling me he's gay.

Dude, fucking relax...
- Fuck.

- Nate!

- Hey, Nate!

- Nate!

- Nate!

Call a fucking ambulance, please!
Please call us a fucking ambulance!
