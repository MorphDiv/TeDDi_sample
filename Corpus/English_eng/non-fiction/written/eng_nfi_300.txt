Throwing what missiles and rockets into-- poof!
Would you like to come over?
Uh, yeah, sure.
I'll grab you a chair.
Thanks.
Oh, cheers, hm.
Are you South African?
Erm, no, I'm from Brisbane.
Where the fuck is that?
Wow.
Well, I...
So, er, where are you?
Come on...
It actually means that you have a lack of calcium.
No, it means I've been drinking too much beer.
That's what it means.
Is there a lid for this?
Or should I just...
Okay, okay...
Thank you.
Help yourself.
My father grows them in a schrebergarten.
In, uh, cardboard boxes?
No, these are from the store.
Do you like strawberries?
Um...
They help you forget your problems.
What makes you think I have problems?
People who travel alone... are usually in search of something, aren't they?
What makes you think that I'm alone?
I see nobody.
Do you always practice your English... chatting up foreigners?
I work in a sport school.
What sort of sports?
I mean, I'm an English teacher, that's why.
Buildings, mostly.
I, er, I really like the GDR architecture.
I wanna do a book.
We say DDR, Deutsche Demokratische Republik.
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
What did you...
You said this was, er, from a schreber...
Erm, these are small gardens.
All together and all with German flags... and those, er, small men from Snow White.
Who lives in these houses?
They just come on weekends.
It's my mum.
She's kind of obsessed.
Does she know you're here?
Yeah.
My mother used to bring me here as a boy.
I always come here to complicate life.
What?
Erm, I think you mean to, er, you'd say "contemplate."
Oh, yeah, right.
How do you say "complicate" in German?
Verkomplizieren.
This one is nice, huh?
Yeah, I like it.
Oh!
Sorry.
Yeah, he likes you.
Oh, my God.
So, why did you come to Berlin?
Er, I was working for a real estate company... taking photos and, erm...
You know, those life experiences... that people talk about all the time?
I wanted to do that, so, I...
I booked a ticket and put my stuff in storage... and came here.
Pretty predictable.
A wolf.
There's a bar upstairs, erm, if you wanted to... come-- actually, it's more like a... kinda crappy rooftop.
I'm afraid I have to meet someone.
Yeah, I have to...
I've got stuff I have to do.
Dresden?
Yeah.
Why Dresden?
Okay.
Tschuss, Clare.
It's nice to meet you.
Hello?
That one's my favorite.
She's holding her hands like that... to hide her deformed finger.
I thought you wanted to leave.
So, if you have a question, you google it.
Yeah.
Are you not?
You photograph disappointment.
I mean, all this DDR shit, all these dreams... it's all... invalid.
But the people were brave.
How do you say suffocate in German?
Uh...
Ersticken.
Erwurgen is...
Did a boy give you that?
No, my mum... did.
She said if I ever got into trouble...
I could hock it and come home.
So quiet.
Berlin is full of these empty places.
Do you want a drink?
They don't open.
Should I make us dinner?
No one will hear you.
I don't want this to end.
All firsts end.
First airplane ride.
First time you get your ears pierced.
First drags of cigarettes.
First fuck.
I wish we could stay like this... where we don't know each other.
I wish I could stay.
What happens when you know someone?
What did you just say?
I love your accent.
I love your mouth, your smile.
I love everything.
Silke, may I ask you to please read the quote?
"Perhaps home is not a place, but simply..."
Erm... "An irrevocable condition"?
Bennie, I see you obviously... consumed this book on the weekend.
James Baldwin wrote this in 1956 in his novel Giovanni's Room.
Who has made a start on it?
Hm?
Franka?
Erm...
Er, the character is constantly moving.
He feels a little bit shame about, erm, about himself... but he says he is, erm, finding himself... but he's just...
What the fuck?
Andi.
Couldn't find the key.
Did you leave me a key?
Yeah.
Sure.
I thought I'd left it on the table.
No.
And then I realized that I couldn't even leave.
Did you lock me in?
Yes, sure.
But next time, I'll tie you to the bed.
The key.
It's on the dresser.
Okay.
"Mine."
Yeah, I was thinking about going... and I'll come back and get my backpack later.
I got you these.
Please open the door.
What's all this?
Please, Andi.
Where's my SIM card, Andi?
What did you do to the windows?
They're reinforced.
If you try to break them, I'll have to board them up.
I just bought these chairs.
Don't do that.
You don't have to do this.
Andi, what is going on?
"What is going on?"
You could have gone to Dresden.
You said you want to stay.
We had sex.
People-- people say all sorts of things in bed.
It doesn't necessarily mean anything.
Please, dear God.
Do you like pesto?
What?
Can we just go for dinner?
Can I have my necklace back?
Open the fucking door!
Ssh!
No one can hear you.
I told my father about us.
I thought you might like to do puzzle.
Would you like to eat something?
I texted your mother for you.
You told her you're okay.
But I'm not okay.
I pay for drinks on my card.
My mum's gonna work it out.
Oh, my God.
There's nowhere for me to go.
Shit.
Jana, Jana.
Hi.
I can't figure out this bit.
Erm...
I would always do the sky first.
Can you help?
Yeah, I think that piece goes there.
I think it goes somewhere in there.
Mm-hm.
Done.
Ssh-ssh.
I miss my mom.
There's no point in missing something you can't have back.
You have me.
You could do so many things.
But I just want to do this.
Okay, now funf.
Shit.
Come on.
Shit.
Oh, God.
Better?
Yeah.
Shall we take that off?
I smell bad.
What would be the worst thing I could ever do to you?
We are a team.
Hello.
If you say anything, I will have to kill her.
Hello.
Who's that?
Student.
What's her name?
Franka.
Turn around.
Clare?
Did you touch this door?
Clare?
Huh?
Can you please... stop?
Boom, boom, boom!
Can't you just be normal?
You're abnormal.
Fuck.
Andreas.
Fuck.
Papa.
Hey.
Papa?
My father's dead.
I thought you weren't gonna come back.
Thank you.
How did you choose me?
You paused on the street.
What was I looking at?
And what about the other girl before me?
How did you choose her?
There was no other girl.
You're lying.
Do you still think about her?
No.
How come?
When you were a kid, did you guys have a fake tree... or a real one?
Real.
You know, we had a--
We had a-- a fake.
It was so hot anyway that--
That a real tree would have died.
And we would go out to my uncle's house.
He has this, like, big property listening to, er, cicadas.
Cicadas?
Erm, they're these little bugs that make noise.
Like, erm...
They go...
And then the other one goes back and...
And it goes...
Then he goes...
And then all their friends join in.
Close your eyes.
Hi.
Hi.
Do you like your present?
Yeah.
Do you like it?
Yes.
You need to help me.
Mama!
How do you think this is going, from one to ten?
From one to ten?
Us.
Maybe...
Er...
Seven.
Hm.
Where's Lotte?
She ran away.
Oh... thank you.
No problem.
What's your New Year's resolution?
Oh, I don't do them any more.
But on New Year's Eve... isn't it important to compensate your life?
What?
I think you mean, uh, "contemplate."
Yeah, right.
Hey!
Help!
No.
Help!
Hey-- hey, listen to me.
It's your fucking fault, okay.
Now we have to clean this mess together.
Okay?
I am sorry.
Take the plastic.
Come on, take your clothes off.
Please.

Pack everything in a backpack.
I get the apartment fumigated tomorrow.
Pack your things.
What're you doing?
Agh!
The cream's in the bathroom.
I can't find it.
It's on the bottom shelf.
My thoughts.

Clare?
I'm down here.

Look at me.
