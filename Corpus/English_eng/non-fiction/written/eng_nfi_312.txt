[DJ scratching records]
Welcome back to Clash of the Cupcakes.
Thank you, DJ Sweet Treats.
Right now, I have to share some rather unpleasant news.
Uh, we were supposed to have some very special guest judges today, specifically five of them, the legendary dance crew Jabbawockeez.
But, uh, I got here today, and I didn't see 'em.
[audience groaning]
Hey!
I don't want to hear that.
They were supposed to be here.
I don't know what happened.

[cheers and applause]
Give it up for the Jabbawockeez!
We'll be right back with more Clash of the Cupcakes.
[record scratching] [funky upbeat music playing]
[sighs]
Hey, Dev.
Uh, great job, man, great job.
Uh, we got a small issue on the last segment, though.
What's up, Lawrence?
So the Jabbawockeez, they don't take their masks off.
They need to take the masks off, right?
They gotta taste the cupcakes.
I don't know.

Like, somebody should have read that beforehand.
Yeah, somebody, you.
You're the producer that booked 'em.
Ah, damn.
For real?
We gonna play the blame game?
Maybe what we should be doing is putting our big boy pants on to figure out a solution.
All right, Lawrence, what if, you know, some of the guys are dancing in the front and then one of the Wockeez just dips behind the table and eats the cupcakes there?
See what happens when we have teamwork, when we work together?
That was just my idea.
Oh, oh.
So we're just going right back to being childish, huh?
I'm just gonna go let the Wockeez know our idea.
[sighs] Jesus.
Hey, Dev.
Hey, what's up, Lisa?
Just coming in for a quick touch-up.
Sure.
So you're Indian, right?
Yes.
Well, I'm friends with this Indian guy
I think you might know.
Come on, you're not gonna do that shit, are you, Lisa?
You don't go up to white people and go, "Hey, you're white, right?
I know this white person.

Well, he said he went to college with you.

All right, I do know him.
-Hmm.

That's the only time in history that hasn't been racist.
Uh, Dev, um, one more thing.
When we sign off, make sure you go,
"Thank you to the Jabbawockeez for blessing the stage."
No, I'm not saying that.
But you have to.

And when you say it, make sure you put a little pizzazz in it.
Why didn't anyone read the contract?
I did read the contract.
I skimmed it.
I didn't skim too well.
I missed a couple of things.
-Jesus.

You're stressing me out.
-Lawrence.

You really need to floss while we're doing our tapings?
Hell yeah.

That shit like termites for your teeth.
Motherfucker don't even want me to floss.

The Jabbawockeez have a very strict don't-take-their-masks-off policy, hence the dance routine instead of a traditional taste.

It's just us.
How'd you guys get back here?
Oh, there's no security.

It was really easy.
Figures.
Thank you so much for this experience.
We never thought we'd see the Wockeez so up close and personal.
You know we're huge Wockee heads.
Can we go meet them now?
-We're so pumped.

Yeah, sure.
-Yes!

Did you guys rehearse that?
-Yeah.

Hey, guys, I-I had some friends that just wanted to say hello if that's cool.
Oh, my God.
It's Joe "Punkee" Larot,
Rynan "Kid Rainen" Paguio,
Phil "Swagger Boy" Tayag.
How do you know who's who?
I can tell by their movements.
You guys, that might have been your best performance since your dance with Taylor Swift at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards.
Yeah, it was even better than your routine with Shaq at the 2009 All-Star Game.
And by the way, I'm Arnold, and this is Brian.
And we know it's against Wockee code to talk, but we just wanted to come give you a quick Jabba bow to pay our respects.
All right, what the fuck?
Okay, that's good, guys.
I'm sure the Wockeez have somewhere to go dance.
Take care, guys.
Did I seem cool around them?
Dude, you did so great.
[Brian sighs]
Thanks for hooking us up, man.
Hey, do you want to grab dinner later?
I can't.

Wait, the Jeff Pastore, the TV guy, Chef Jeff?
Yeah.

He's kind of my boss.
Wow, I love Jeff's Table.
Did you ever see that Vietnam episode?
It was pho-nomenal.
[laughter]
Did anyone ever say that before?
Probably.

I don't know.

I've never heard it.
What are you guys doing now?
Um, some friends of mine from Italy are in town.
Remember Francesca and Pino?

-Care to join?

We're heading up to Queens to the Kids Foot Locker.
The Wockeez are doing a little in-store blessing.
We got to get those primo seats.
Arnie, you're gonna block all these kids' views.
First come, first served.
Buona sera!
Buona sera!
[Francesca] Shah!
-[laughs] -[Dev] Hi.
-Wow.

I can't believe you're here!
Neither can I.
You're still Italian.
Yes.
How are you?
I'm good.
Where's your boyfriend, Mr. Pino?
Well, he had to work.
He's meeting some tile distributors.
So it's just me.
Well, the man loves tiles.
So New York City?

What do you think?
I don't know.

Yeah.

New York City:

-[both laugh]

I mean, I've been walking all day through the city just staring at the building like this.
Ah!
-I love it.

Well, that is adorable.
I gotta tell you something, though.
I am very hungry.
Is there any way we can see the entire museum in, like, three minutes and then go get food?
[speaking Italian]
What does that mean?
If you're good, I'll give you a cookie.
-Yay!

[laughs]
Come on.

-Oh, how is the cupcake show going?

It's not the most inspiring gig, but it's okay.
Hmm.
Can I be honest?
Oh, God.

Shit on Clash of the Cupcakes all you want.
Okay, I don't understand why do people watch this show?
It's just a show about watching people eat cupcakes.
[Dev] I don't know.
I just host it, all right?
I say the contestants' names, and I announce the winners at the end.
[Francesca] Really?

Couldn't they just write it on the screen?
[Dev] They do, but I say it in a really enthusiastic way.
-[Francesca] Okay, wait.

I want to hear that.
[scoffs] Right now?
Yes, right now.
Come on.

-No way.

We don't have this kind of show in Italy.
Please, do it for me just once.

Please?

Please welcome, all the way from Cleveland,
Karen from Karen's Confections!

That was awful. [laughs]
[Francesca] Ah.
So this is the piece that I really wanted to see.
It's called The Dinner Party.
Cool.
Is it me or do all these look like vaginas?
[Francesca] Yeah, it's kind of like saying that all these women across history have been discriminated against just because they have vaginas.
Whoa.
Did this lady have a piano vagina?
I'm never going to a museum with you again.
[both chuckle]
Oh, how was the-- the date the other night?
It was fun.
I had a lovely evening with this woman named Priya.
Oh.

-Oh.

I met her on, uh, one of those dating apps.
What are dating app?
It's like these apps on your phone where you see people's faces, and when you see a face you like, you hit a button, and if they hit a button on your face, then you have a match.
And then you can send each other messages and then you go out on a date.
Wow, when you say it out loud, it sounds insane.
[Francesca] No, it sounds crazy.
It is, but you meet people.

I had a good time with Priya.
Okay, then tell me about your night with her.
Um, well, we went to a wine bar.
Mm.
And then we went to this roof bar.
Mm.
And then we had some kissing in the cab.
Oh.
And then what?
Did you call her the day after?
I sent her a nice text message that night that said...
Oh, that's sweet.
..."Hey, Priya, thanks for a lovely evening.
I'm jealous of the lucky pillow that gets to hold your beautiful face tonight."
That's nice, right?
[groans]
What?

If you got a text like that from a guy, you wouldn't be like, "Oh, that's sweet"?
No, I would do, like, "Ugh."
Well, Priya said, "Ugh, let's get dinner on Thursday."
I'm right.

I win.

I'm out.

I'm gonna keep looking at vaginas.

-Wow.

You know, I just wandered into Shuko, say hi to my friend Nick, he's all,
"Chef, you gotta try this tuna."
Story of my life, right?
Next thing you know, I'm ten courses deep

So then I pop in to Casa Mono to have a drink with a friend, just one drink, next thing you know, I'm knee-deep in the best paella I've had all year.
-Crazy fuckin' night.

Ah, well, full disclosure.
This is my first dinner, and for lunch I had a boring salad.
I ate half.

That's what you do.
Gentlemen, compliments of the chef, octopus pizzaiolo, beef carpaccio Piemontese, and some fresh mozz that we made here in the house.

There's something wrong with the mozzarella.
Yep, just what I thought.
It's fuckin' delicious.

Now, a little birdie told me you spent some time in Italia.
True or false?
Uh, the little birdie was telling the truth.
I lived in Modena for a few months, learned how to make pasta.
You're kidding me.

We went there a couple years ago with Jeff's Table.
Best episode ever.
-You see that one?

You remember that fuckin' scene--
Remember that scene where I'm sitting there with the old guy in the cafe with the hat?
I actually didn't see it.
You just seemed so fired up,

Um, we did a taping of Clash of the Cupcakes.
Uh, you know we had that dance crew the Jabbawockeez on earlier this week?
Who is that?
They're like these guys.
They, like, dance and have masks.
They were really good.
Cool.
Um, how about you?
How was your day?
Yeah, it was a pretty normal day.
Just meetings and whatnot.

Went with sparkling water, huh?
Yeah.

How about this?
Dinner at Il Buco.
Perfecto.

Yeah, of course.

Yeah, I think I'm just gonna get the fish.
