Previously on "blood drive"...
All your security privileges are revoked, and you're not to leave the building.
But know this, you will never be a part of your race again.
When you work for sergeant gower, you stick to the rules.

I'm going back out there.

Until contracrime clears you, sit on your ass.
Say hello to Christopher 2.0.
The hell did you do to me?
Karma fell in the revolt.
What... what do you mean?
Karma's dead.
Is that all you got?
I know what you're trying to do.
You want to be punished for your guilt.
I don't know how I can do this without you anymore.
We are convinced this is the right direction for the race, just the thing the division needs.
Enough.
This race is more than...
Entertainment.
More than testing the blood engines, a technology so powerful it's set to restructure the economic system of the entire planet.
No, this race...
Is the greatest sacrifice in human history.
It's a bloodstained altar, the Goresoaked peak of a Mayan temple, the smoke from an erupting volcano on mount Olympus!
And that pleasing aroma is not for god.
It's for heart enterprises, the most powerful corporation in the known universe!
But this sacrifice could be for you as well.
This is what we're offering.
Not a job, not a career, but...
The chance to be worshipped.
Master of ceremonies?

God of the stage?

But if you have just a modicum of the oily black soul that we think you do, well, when this show goes live to the whole world, you'll be the high priest of heart.
We need fresh blood...
By the gallon.
And you, sir, have the swagger and the verve we want at heart enterprises.
The blood drive is yours.
All you have to do is claim it.
What do you say?
I'd say...
You've made the right decision.
God.
Dear diary,
I wonder if all the other cops know how small my dick really is.
Seriously, what is that?
Something a friend told me once.
Do you write down what I say?
Only when you say something smart.
So...

- Ha.

You gonna order or not?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Got to get the right thing.
She doesn't even know you exist.
Why would she care what you eat?
Trust me, they care.
Would you date a guy who ordered a veggie burger?
Depends.

Hi, can I take your order?
Yeah, can I have a number two with a coke?
And, um...
Give me just a second, if you don't mind.
Take your time.
Just hit the silver button when you're ready.
So if you love this girl so much...
Tell me what's so great about her.
You mean beside the fact she's hot and gets a discount on food?
Yeah, Casanova.

I come here three times a week and she's always nice.
She's great with people.
Seems smart, you know?
And she's got the best smile I've ever seen.
He'll have what I'm having.
And, throw your number in too, if you don't mind.
What?
And that'll be $46.07 at the next window.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
Asshole.

See?

What's the holdup?
Not bad, officer Bailey.
Hey, hey, hey.
I don't want to lose the number.

Come on!

I give you a lot of shit, but you're the real deal...
A fuckin' hero in blue.
Thanks.
Wow.

Where's your daddy?
Above the line.

Fuck off.
Try again.
Heart enterprises called him in.
- Why?

Jesus!
Twice for lying.
Hey, you dickless piece of shit.
I thought you were slink.
You realize you two are like the same person, right?
I am nothing like that charlatan.
Whatever you have to say to him, you can say to me.
I'm in charge now.
Every gentleman gives every person a chance to learn manners.
As soon as the last race is finished, there will be a meeting to discuss a new direction
- for this race.

They're not gonna listen to you.
They love slink.
I'm tired of hearing about slink.
He's gone, and I am the master of mayhem now.
Doesn't look like that to me.
Hey, boss!
Last three racers inbound from the savage land!
Gonna be a close one.
Not that close.
But you can't kill all three!
I can do whatever I want.
I have this.
There's a new sheriff in town, and he's fucking gorgeous, darling.
Just so we're clear, you and that cop are the reason why slink is on his way out.
Always finding ways to subvert his rules and go snooping around for your little bitch of a sister.
Talk about my sister again like that, and I will rip your fucking spine out of your neck!
You just didn't learn.
Nothing can hurt as much as losing her, so you want to keep me in check, what else you fucking got?
This.
Why isn't this working?
Scholar!
Scholar...
What is wrong with this thing?
Nice try, chump.
You can't blow shit up inside the party walls.
How does she know that and I don't?
I guess heart should have left me in charge.
It worked on her before.
You only shocked her before.
She's right.
They built it for killing drivers on the race, not for during the after party.

To stop racers from doing exactly what you're doing.
Good luck keeping the race under control.
You're off to a great start.
The moment you set foot outside these party walls, you're mine.
Break one rule and I will spread your face like butter all over the inside of that awful car you drive.
The blood drive is mine!
What are you doing?
I got to go.
I didn't want to leave you with an empty tank.
I didn't know how to tell you.

I got a book full of evidence against heart and nothing tying it all together except my own testimony, but...
I got to get off this race.
I know you need to keep racing... great.
I'm with you.
Karma's gone, so what the hell am I racing for?
And I've seen more than you, so let me be your eyewitness.
Are you sure?
Look, you risked your life for Karma without even knowing her.
Maybe this way, I can repay the favor.
Besides, you were right.
Best way to avenge Karma, stick it to heart.
That's the thing about this race.
Distracts you from what's important.
So what do you say?

It's a date.
Now we just got to keep slink from blowing our heads up.
Yeah, about that...
Slink's not the problem anymore.
In a single moment in the dead of night, this country broke in two.
A fissure of death, a painfilled gash...
Heaven to me, but hell to you.
The scar.
No scientist could explain it;

The entire world simply watched in horror as a single fracking disaster tore open open America's heartland.
Humanity fled to the coast, frightened of all the terrors the earth might have stored in its belly.
A handful of brave souls ventured into the scar, never to return, never to speak of its wonders.
But I...
I have peered into its depths.
And I have seen our reward.
The pain of eternity and the sweet, wet caress of agony.
It's a place no cameras have ever been before, until now, and as the blood drive heads straight into the scar, bringing our racers facetoface with their deepest fears...
God damn it, slink.
Just let me eat in peace.
But it's... it's a good pitch.
This is my life's work.
Was your life's work.
I'm loving this new look on you.
I think you found your true calling.
You can steal fire from a god, but he will get his revenge.
And when the race careens off the tracks, you'll come begging.
And when you do, sweet meat,
I'll be mopping your guts off the floor.
So you'll still be a janitor then.
That's not what I meant.
Someone turn on the race.
What's this?
What is this?
A spinoff?
A crossover episode?
The gentleman's our new master of ceremonies.
He stole your fire, your thunder, and your job.
When the show premieres to the outside world, he will be the true star.
We're editing you down to a cameo.
Any final notes?
You missed a spot.
Think.
Think, slink.

Cleanup in cafeteria 7.
Find some rube to do your bidding.
Cleanup in cafeteria 7.
Thank you for coming this evening.
Whether under threat of pain or death or of your own volition, it's important that we spend this time together.
Civilized.

A community...
God damn it!
Sit right back down this instant!
As I was saying, certainly, we're all psychos, sociopaths, and scoundrels, but that doesn't mean that we should be uncivilized.
Fuck this!
Listen, if I wanted to be a pussy,
I'd have stayed in studio city.
Anyone who wants to fuck shit up, come with...
Hoho!
Now...
If there are no further distractions... hey, genius.
We just want to talk.
You're the smartest guy in the camp;

We just need you to pop these little guys out of our heads.
You know, these bombs, they...
Well, ththey're wedged against our spines, and they're feeding off our kinetic energy.
Unless they're powered down, the instant that we...

II'm not smart enough.
I'm not.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slugger.
No, no, it's not your fault.
All right, so plan b.
If we have the controller, he can't hurt us.
So we steal it from this dandy nutsack, shock him till he drops, and get the hell out of here.
Okay, and if he sees us coming, we're screwed.
So then we hide in plain sight.
What are you doing?
How is this gonna distract him?
- No.

- No, no.

Grace.

Have room for one more...
Naughty boy?
Ooh, I think it'll be tight, but I'm sure I can slip you in.
Hey, asshole.
Not in the mood today, peasant, palliard, plebe.
Are you having a stroke?
You think you're so smart, see, that you got heart fooled, see?
Your plug 'n' play girlfriend all wrapped around your dick, see?
But you're wrong.
Are you done?
Can I kick your ass now?
You can try.
But first...
We may be able to help each other.
- I'm not helping you.

Can't tell me she hasn't been messin' with yo' head.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You think women are so hard to understand, but cybergirl's all ones and zeroes.
You just need to crack the code.
Open the door for me...
And I'll help you tap into her video feed.
She can see through your eye.
Imagine what you'll discover when you can see through hers.
What door?
That's not a door, that's...
Secret shit.
We shouldn't be here.
Boy, she really did a number on you.
I've seen a lot of brainwashed idiots in my day, but you set the world record for being pussywhipped.
- I'm not pussywhipped.

It's not even a real pussy.
What's behind this door?
One of heart's mistakes.
Come now.
He's a prisoner, just like you.
Don't you want to be the good guy?
You promised.
Try channel 694.
I'd run if I were you.
This way, little buddy!
This way!

This way!

So...

But I'm sure you prettied it up nicely.
Um, yeah.
How are things going with that partner of yours?
We're...

Come on.
I've seen the way you look at her.
That's not really how I swing.
Reeeaaally?
I had no idea.
Arthur Bailey.
Mind you, it shouldn't surprise me.
You two have never really vibed that way.
And from what I hear...
Grace is a hetero home run.
I've heard that too.
I'm so glad...
That you...
Opened up to me, Arthur.
It can be so hard sometimes.
Sorry.
I haven't had a chance to cut my nails lately.
I don't mind at all.
Exactly how stupid...
Do you think I am?
Pretty fuckin' stupid.
This is what happens when you doublecross me.
I might not be able to blow you up, but let's see what happens if I fry your brains for an hour or so.
Who's there?
Show yourself!
Shit.
This is heart testing me.
I know it.
I need that controller fixed.
Look, ii...

Machinery is the one thing in which you excel.
Twist some screws, cross some wires.
Help me make Arthur and grace go boom.
Don't you have bigger problems?
Two birds, one stone.
When that ogre pounces on those two fools,
I'll blow them all to bits.
- Yeah, but...

Have you fallen for those two dogooders?
They saved my life at the diner.
In order to save their own.
At least I'm honest about what I see in you:
Your work.
Your inventions fund my lifestyle...
These clothes, this perfect skin.
We both know that.
Now, you should really be honest with yourself.
What do you have to offer anybody, besides your tinkering?
You're repulsive.
Those two are fools who do not know their own potential.
I do not have that problem.
Now, you can help me and share in my spoils, or you can be alone.
689... 690... 691...
692... 693... 694.
God.
Sergeant gower?
Sweet god.
There is no god, sergeant gower.
Then hail Satan, bitch.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
What about this?
No!
The only thing I like better than banging you is watching you seduce that idiot Christopher.
He's got no clue.
And I think he might really love you.
I don't understand.
Of course you don't.
It's a human thing.
You're just a toaster with a vibrating...
.

Assuming that we actually get past the rampaging giant out there and steal the controller and ditch the mayhem party, then what?
We're in the middle of a wasteland.
We have to make it to a major city, and New York's on the other side of the scar, so...
We go back to la?
It's a trek, but it's our best shot at taking down heart.
Plus, I have a connection with the da.
The da.
Yeah, I can't wait to see their face when we tell them about the 8foot ogre out there.
And then what, Arthur?
What the hell are we gonna do with ourselves then?
I know what I'm doing.
Nothing.
No more fighting, no more missions...
No more killing.
Yeah, good luck with that.
Miss me?
Where's the controller, dipshit?
I came to make a deal.
Hard as it is for me to say this out loud, you two are the best fighters we have.
Kill that giant for me, and I'll let you both go free.
You hear that, grace?
He's gonna let us walk free.

- Just like that.

On an average day, maybe not.
But I have a race to get back on track, and you two are a Thorn in my side.
Kill that giant.
It's a winwin situation.
You both wander off in the chaos.
I broke a nail.
What was his name?
Nick zigler, sir.
That name sounds made up.
Well, he shouldn't have opened his mouth.
Find out who the hell that is.
We have a theory, sir.
- Are you running?

So this is test subject number 39462, one Mr. denali.
Thank you for volunteering.
Now, I've managed to stabilize every single one of my serums into a single compound...
The negative side effects of smax, the brainaltering aspects of red rapture.
What I'm holding here is either more powerful, more important to humanity, more shockingly destructive than the atomic bomb, or it's just a bunch of shit mixed together.
Either way, I am unable to test it until I have more lab results...
Oy!
Cut that.

Cut, cut, cut!
He never should have gotten out.
God, this is terrible.
But I thought you wanted more carnage.
You should be loving this.
That freak killed half the racers.
How can I test engines without a race?
This is your fault!
I know it.
Me?
But I've been held captive here at heart tower like a damsel in distress.
How could it possibly be my fault?
That's the cop's old partner.
What's he doing here?
You'd have to ask the aki unit in charge of him.
The point is, nothing escapes me.
But something has escaped you.
Where's your gentleman now?
Why isn't he fighting that thing?
If I were there, that giant would be a smear on the ground, and we'd all be dancing on its bones.
Fine.
You have one more chance.
Get the race back on track, or you'll be terminated, contract or not.
I'm sorry, I'm not used to hearing the sound of your desperation.
Could you whisper it to me slowly?
Tell me about him.
- Did I hurt him?

Hey, fat fuck.
How'd you know I was talking to you?
I'm kind of tired of fighting.
I'll make you a deal.
Just come squash me and put me out of my misery.
Good job, Barbie.
You too.
Shit.
Hello, Christopher.
Care to join us?
This is my room.
You can watch, but...
You have to get naked.
What the hell are you doing here, sergeant?
You can't trust her.

That's how they control their prisoners.
I'm not a prisoner.
Why do I feel this way?
What have you done to me?
Think about it, officer.
She's not human.
She's a sex toy.
I'm the one that did this to you.
What?
You're a fucking cop!
We were never cops.
Christ, you're just as dense as your partner...
Trying to figure out the maze and running into walls.
You always worked for heart.
Every arm you broke, every jaw you busted was all part of their plan.
All the violence in the street was designed to create chaos.
We blurred the line between cop and criminal until no one knew who the good guys were.
And then you got too close to the truth.
So we led you to the race.
I'm the reason you're here.
I'm the reason why Arthur has a bomb in his head.
You failed, you pathetic piece of shit.
No wonder roboslut wants to screw me more than you...
You shouldn't have done that.
According to my algorithms, you have weeks of behavioral modifications left before you are capable of murder.
I guess love doesn't obey algorithms.
Love?
All security restraints have been lifted.
You are free to go anytime.
Let's go, bitch.
You're not done yet?
This is the perfect time.
I could kill them all with one click, but, no, you can't perform.
Shut up!

You can't rush genius.
Gutter rats like you astound me.
You've forgotten what you are...
A puny, useless genetic mistake with only one function.
If you can't fix that controller, then what's your value to anyone?
I'm so sick...
Of these freaks...
Giving us hell.
Watch out!
Fuck.
Arthur?
Thank god.
Did I get him?
Argh!
Scholar, pop the hood!
Daddy's home!
You've all been very naughty!
So much work to do.

Hey, boss.
No, no...
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, no...
They fired you!
The race is mine!
Please.
You can't outdandy me.
There's a reason you failed.

What I do is an art form.
It takes skill to orchestrate scenarios.
Months of planning.

I've been a hundred steps ahead of everyone for this entire race.
What makes you think you can beat me?
The business card you found in the scholar's mechanic shop,
I'm the one who slipped it into your manpurse.
And domi's marriage counselor didn't recommend a death race without a little outside influence.
And did you really think a girl as headstrong as grace could be recruited of her own free will?
I had to drug her sister and drive her half batshit crazy before she'd sign up for this.
Everyone has had their fate guided, directly controlled, by me.
What makes you think a pansy like you could just step in and take it over?
You love this race so much?
I'll kill every racer you have.
If I can't be in charge, no one can!
That's against the rules...
And certainly not very gentlemanly of you.
Fuck the rules.
Fuck you!
The work I put into this race...
The things I've let that freak do to my beautiful penis just to keep winning!
Good...
Riddance.
Clean it up.
By all means, keep walking.
You're gonna die.
Grace...
Stop.
So dull.
So two episodes ago.
My god, you're a stubborn bitch.
Relax.
She'll live.
Put her in the car and get your ass back out onto the road.
Rasher will send coordinates.
Or do you want to test the limits of a real master of mayhem?
I'll drive for a while.
You try and dream of better days.
There are things I've done...
You know, things I did for him...

You want a ride?
Yeah.
Come on.
Apologize...
For helping that traitor.
No.
Change the coordinates for Arthur and grace.
Take them through red river.
That brings them to the edge of the scar.
I thought we weren't supposed to kill grace.
What heart doesn't know won't hurt us.
I'm tired of your disrespect.
So from now on, the blood drive will continue as I see fit.
