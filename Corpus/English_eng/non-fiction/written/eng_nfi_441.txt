Now that you're confessing,
I have to admit that my anger, my contempt for you is subsiding.

How can I make it up to you?
I'm so ashamed of what I've done.

Good to see you, Walter.

What's his name again?
Ed.
Ed Hurley.
Oh, right, yeah.
You're looking beautiful.
Well, thanks.
[chuckles]
So, uh, to what do I owe this pleasure?
Norma, I had to make the drive 'cause I got last month's reports this morning, and I was so excited to share them with you.
Tell me.
Hmm-mm.
Three of our five Norma's Double R franchises turned a profit.
And that's a huge milestone for such a new brand, particularly when this whole region still faces such uphill challenges economically.
So that's good?
[chuckles] That's very good.
[Walter and Norma speaking indistinctly]
Looking at what's...
Curiously, one of the two that's lagging is this one right here...
Your flagship diner.
Well, business always takes a little dip this time of year.
It's been going on for a few months now.
So I took the liberty of running a point-of-sale analysis between this location and the others.
I-I can't really decipher that.
Could you just tell me what it means?
In black and white, you're spending too much per pie and not charging enough.
Well, look, Walter,
I-I've heard from other people that they think that our pies at the other locations are just not as good as the ones we have here.
I hear you.
And I gave them all my exact recipes, as per our agreement, but I don't think they're following them.
Norma, I assure you they're following your recipes to the letter, but also... per the agreement... [sighs]
Using their discretion about where they get the ingredients.
Mm, no.
All my ingredients are natural, organic, local.
But this was our agreement.
Norma... you're a real artist.
But love doesn't always turn a profit.
We believe in you 100 percent, but from a business perspective, the board would like you to consider some alternatives without sacrificing any of the high standards that you're so well-known for.
Well, if you can explain the alternatives,
It's just about tweaking the formula to ensure consistency and profitability.
For instance, we think it's really time you changed this name to Norma's Double R.
[sighs]
You know, Walter, in Twin Peaks, it's been the Double R Diner for over 50 years, and that's how people know it.
No disrespect to the Double R, but you'll recall our market research showed people responded so much more favorably to your name...
Norma's Double R, as it should be.
You're the face of the franchise.
[chuckles] [exhales softly]
Are we on for dinner later?
To celebrate?
[chuckles]
Yes, Walter.
