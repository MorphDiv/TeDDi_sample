Karma.
When I dropped her off at Kane hill, that place was halfway normal.
[Blow thumps] - [Grunts]
- And now I find that it's a sugar-fiend shit show.
Someone checked her out.
Who was it?
- Kane hill?
Kane hill--sounds familiar.
- You were the goddamn hospital administrator.
[Dramaticmusicalsting]
- Ooh.
- How's that even possible?
- Oh, I wear many hats.

- This isn't working.
It's just turning him on.
- Oh, the good cop, my hero.
- He knows the truth, Barbie.
And I'm gonna beat it out of him.
- Okay, well, why don't you let me ask him some questions while he still has some teeth?
Okay.
What does heart want with medical facilities and what does that have to do with patients like Karma?
Tell me how they're connected.

About Karma, about heart, about all the messed-up things you people have ever done.
- The world's gone to hell, officer krupke.
Why don't you just accept it?
- Because that's not true.
Not everyone's as bad as you.
- Show me one unsullied thing on this septic tank of a planet.
[Broodingmusic]
Ah.
- Christopher, wherever you're keeping him, he's a good cop too.
- Oh, Gracie, piggy here thinks he's a poster boy.
Well, that action man costume's not fooling me for one second, Arthur dear.
I think we both know who you really are.

It won't be long before they come in here and trash the place.

Uh, is it getting hot in here, or is it, uh, just me?
[Light,whimsicalwhistling]
- Slink.
- I don't know, Diane.
He doesn't look like a mass murderer.
- Yeah, well, he's a trickster by trade.
Don't let him fool you.
That's slink.
Uh, tough crowd, tough-- tough crowd.
- When is it okay to kill?
[Arthur continues talking in background]
"When it's for love."
[Upliftingmusic]
All right.
Let's do it.
- Wait.
We'll never get to him through this crowd.
We're gonna have to thin the herd.
- The plan was to kill slink, not a whole party.
- Well, they might try and stop us.
So why don't we give them the kiss and let the virus do its job?
And then we take him out when there is nobody left...
[Together] To stop us.

And that muffin turns to the other muffin, says, "oh, my-- oh, my god, a talking muffin."

What do you see?
Besides the smurf orgy, quickly.
Who do you see that doesn't fit in?
- Well, I see a man and a woman that look like grown-up versions of the bobbsey twins.
- Listen to me very carefully, very, very carefully.
Grace, they will destroy everything.
Those two may appear harmless, but they're not.
They've unleashed something very serious, and we need to put an end to it.
- "We"?
We--slink, there is no "we."
So quit playing games.
Where is Karma?

But if you want my help, you and Arthur have got to stop those twins!
