Then why were you out in it the night before last?
I wasn't.

Whoever she is, she's not worth the bother.
I think David's mixed up in something.
That girl they found in the Kingsmead...
Jack, it's me, Jane.

- Apparently, they're gonna rob a bank.

We have movement at the Pembridge.
Do you know what kind of man Clifford Bentley is?
What's that for?
You a superstitious man, Silas?
He's losing his grip on this job.
There's a matching necklace, part of a set.
Oh my God.
- Jane, there's something --

I saw you both earlier.

About what?
- Sarge?

Go!

Golf Hotel to all units.

I want two of you on doors!

Two of you here.

David...?
There were coppers watching the cafe.

- What do you mean?

Where's John and your dad?

Dunno.

- But you warned them?

You go.

I'll go to Reg's place and meet you there.
David, stop.

Take it all.
Wait until dark, then get yourself away from here.
I love you, Ma.
Sarge?

Spence?

Shit.

- I can't hear a bloody word.

Morgan?
She's alive.
People in front...
Guv?

Can you hear me, anyone?
Body over here!
- Guv!

No.
Len!

Len!

- He's gone.

- He's gone.

No, no, no.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Renee!

Where's John?
Ain't he with you?
No.
What do you mean, "no"?
Cliff, where is he?
As...

I screamed at him that he had to go.
But you saw him leave?
Where is he, then?
Where's David?

He's... waiting for us at Reg's.
Cliff, please, do the right thing and let him go.

- What are you on about?

He won't cope in prison.

Nobody's going to prison.
Look.
You should have seen what we left behind.
There's enough here.

Come on.
I'm staying here, in case John comes back.
He's not coming back.
I'm staying here.
All right.
All right?
Not really.
When I first saw him down there...
I thought he was knocked out.
- I thought he'd choke up on some dust and...

- I'm just saying.

Right, gents.

I suggest you make yourselves useful and join 'em.

Yeah.

Jane... come ride with us.
Best thing's to keep busy.
Got you that from the hospital shop.
Can't stand that stuff.
Such gratitude!
You look like you could use it more.
Apart from feeling like someone's stuck knitting needles in my ears, I'm fine.
Did they tell you what happened?
The doctor said there'd been some fatalities.
Are all our team accounted for?
Er... two suspects inside the vault and erm...
No?
Police!

- You can't just barge in here!

- I ain't seen them.

- Don't lie to us.

Have a heart and tell me.

She doesn't know.
Right.

A man we identified as John Bentley was killed in an explosion at the British Savings Bank...
- All right.

We need to know where Clifford and David are.
I ain't seen 'em.
There's no-one here.
Right.

- Where are they?

- Who told you about John?

It was on the wireless.
We haven't released that information yet, so who told you John didn't get away?
Nobody.
A Bentley till the bitter end, eh?

Irene Bentley, I'm arresting you under suspicion of assisting an offender.
Excuse me.

No.
Thank you, sir.
- Yes?

No.
Excuse me.

- No, sorry.

Yeah, I'm sure.
I didn't know you were back.
We've brought in Renee Bentley.
I came back to join the manhunt... .. but I've just been sat in here for half an hour.
You need to see this.
Hudson and I found it in the Bentley lock-up.
It matches the bracelet Julie-Ann was wearing when she died.
Yes, sir.
Understood.
Absolutely.
Thank you, sir.
Super's finished the next-of-kin visit.
Think I'm gonna head off and see 'em myself.
Could you pass these on?
It's the Guv's watch and wallet, and his warrant card.
- Sarge, if you need a WPC...

Like you said, I need to keep busy.
It's his wife and kids.
Paul, can I borrow you?

Do you know how many wives and girlfriends we've had sat across from us, insisting they were completely in the dark?
You're in this up to your neck.
We're watching all the ports, so they have nowhere to go.
I don't know where they are.
That's bollocks, and you know it.
- Sarge, can I...?

No.

If you want to help David, you need to tell us where he is.
Did David tell you about Julie-Ann?
She was 17.
Someone strangled her and dumped her with the rubbish, like she didn't matter.
Where was he on the evening of Sunday 13th May?
- I don't know.

Did he come home, soaked to the skin?
He was home!
How's he been acting since?
You're his mum.
Mums always know when something's not right.
I found... .. a photo of them both.
Him and Julie-Ann.
She mattered to David, didn't she?
Did he tell you about her?
Did you know she was pregnant?
- Was the child David's?

Oh, God.
Where can we find him?
Where?
You can't defend him on this.

I don't know.
I found this in the corner, under a shelf there.
200 quid, stuffed in an old biscuit tin.
And here... shoe marks... .. size and pattern of which seem a good match for Julie-Ann's boots.
How far from here to where her body was found?
300-400 yards.
- Possible she was dragged all that way?

This could be where she was strangled.
That money you found at the lock-up matches the notes Julie-Ann stole from her dad.
Well, we know she was doing a deal with O'Duncie.
After she left the squat, she needed a secure location to stash the money until the deal was in place.
So she gave it to David to hang on to?
But why did he turn the garage upside-down?

- To destroy the crime scene?

O'Duncie has already beaten up Eddie, so she's not gonna trust anyone with £200, and doesn't tell David where she's hidden it.
Then on the 13th, David Bentley wants to know where the money is.
And ends up throttling her.
- We've found the Bentley van.

Let's go.
Sarge.

- You sent cars out?

WPC Tennison...
What does that look like to you?
Julie-Ann's bra.
She was moved in the van.
I thought dragging her all that way on crutches was unlikely.
We need to find the hole he's hiding in and visit the known associates in the area.
Right.

Hudson, Edwards.

Harris, your list.

- Hello.

- Positive?

Sorry to... bother you.
My name's DC Edwards.

Er... no, sorry.

We'd have a better chance getting Clifford's mates to tap-dance than co-operate.
Here.

- I haven't done the job driving course yet.

Well, thank you, sir.
It's a bloody wild-goose chase.
Where next?
Next one's on Fairview Avenue.
None of my business, but I know you and Bradfield were...
He really liked you.

Like I said... none of my business.
When I mentioned Clifford Bentley, that last fella spat on the floor.
Right.

How would David move the body on his own?
I've seen a wife butcher a husband twice her size.
You'd be surprised what people are capable of when shit hits the fan.
Not long before evening drinking.

Open up!

I can see you!
Idiot.
- Sarge?

Reggie Barker, is it?
- Where are you going, mate?

- The Bentley boy's upstairs.

Yeah.

Is his old man here, as well?
- He's CID.

So I don't want no part of this.
- Help me move him.

You're on your own.
Five One Seven to Golf Hotel.
Golf Hotel to Five One Seven.

Back-up needed at the King's Head pub, Fairview Avenue.
Hey!
David?
Please just go.
Don't do this.

David...
I know you weren't at the bank vault.

- I don't care any more.

If you jump, they'll say you did it.
I didn't!
I'd never hurt her.
But you were her boyfriend and you never came forward.
David, I know about you and Julie-Ann.
No.

She was everything to me.
She...

She took away my pain... all of it.
All I wanted was for us to get away from here, from the estate, the drugs.
From her selling herself.
He thought she was just a junkie with a big mouth.
He didn't know who she was or what she meant to me.
- Your dad?

You mean John?
Are you talking about John?
Tell me, David.

If it was John... why?
Cos I told her about the job.
I told her about the fucking job and he found out.
It was me who found her body in the car park.
It was me who made the phone call.
David, let me help you.
Please.
Julie-Ann wouldn't want you to do this.
If what you're saying is true, and it was John, then this needs to come out.
- David, we need to go.

Shut up.
Come on, son.

What about John?

He got caught in the explosion.
- He's dead, David.

But you made it out all right?
Come on.
- David, if you leave...

Dad!
- Dad!

Oh, no!
Oh...
I need something to stop the blood.
Help me.
Help me!
Press on his chest.

No!

Erm...
- Erm...

I'm cold.
- Back-up's on its way.

WPC...

Jane...
I loved her.
- I know.

Stay with me, David.

You piece of scum....

- Get this bag of piss down the station.

- Tennison, are you hurt?

No.

It's David Bentley's.

Let's get you to the station and get you cleaned up.

Come on.
Come on.

Take her to the station, OK?
When are you coming back?
I don't think I am.
What?
Do you know what my mum said to me, when I was joining the force?
No doubt the same as mine.

She said I'd end up dead.
And you think this has proved her right?
Kath, you can't give up.
You've got a shot at joining CID.
I'd give my right arm to be in your shoes.
It's not giving up, accepting your limitations.
I need someone to look up to.
I'm not much of a role model.
You're not if you quit.
Funeral's tomorrow.
So surreal.
He was standing right in front of me.
How are you holding up?
Good.

Come on.

Hello?
- Jane!

Oh...
We're here now.

Let's pack up your things, and we'll drive you home.
Erm... no, it's all right.

- Erm...

- OK.

I promise.
Would you both stay, just for a little bit?
Of course we will.
As long as you need us to.
What do you want?
I wanted to return this to you... make sure you got it.
It was David's.
One of the lads at the station was meant to get it back to you a couple of weeks ago.
He forgot.
Can't trust men to get anything right.
Ta.
Take care of yourself.
One glowing review, you're the Sheriff of Hackney?
It's just...
It's just what?

- You'll put in a word for me?

- I'm not very good at that.

In the meantime...
Clifford Bentley's brief's kicking up a stink, saying I hit him during his arrest.
Now, someone might want to ask you some questions about that, so er...
- You didn't touch him, sarge.

- Now, back into Comms, Tennison.

Golf Hotel to Four-O-Two.

Golf Hotel to all units.

Victim is with a Mrs Jenkins at number 18.

All right.
