I did some digging.

- Ma'am, please.

Two days ago, according to your own report, you let a Prince of Hell escape and the mother of Lucifer's child.
And one of my best men was murdered by an American Hunter,
- whom you allowed to live.

These Hunters are out of control.
The brothers Winchester, in particular, which Lady Bevell has exhaustedly documented.
Ma'am, if... if you could just listen...
- to what?

No.
I don't think I will.
Hunters are dogs, Mr. Davies.
You give them an order, and they obey.
That's how it works.
So tell me, do they?
Do they obey you?
No.
Of course not.
So... this Eileen Leahy will be found and killed in accordance with the Code.
As for the Winchesters, like any rebellious Hunter, they will be investigated.
And, if found guilty, executed.
"If"?
If they're found guilty?
Aren't Hunters always found guilty?
Be careful, Mr. Davies.
No.
My entire life with the Men of Letters,
I never broke a rule.
And yes, at first I was shocked at how Sam and Dean operate.
But what Lady Bevell doesn't mention is the lives they've saved, monsters destroyed, and outcomes made better not because of the Code, but because of Sam and Dean Winchester's sense of what's right.
And that is the crux of the matter.
The Code is not a suggestion.
It's an absolute.
The Code is what separates us from the monsters.
It is the order by which we all live.
No.
The code is what makes a young boy kill his best friend.
When I was a child, I had nothing.
I owed you everything, and I obeyed.
But I'm a man now, Dr. Hess, and I can see the choices, and I choose to do the right thing.
