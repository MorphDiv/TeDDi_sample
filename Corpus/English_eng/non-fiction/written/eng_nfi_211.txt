I'm pregnant.
It's just weird being back.
You know, seeing Linda.
'Abigail's burnt remains were discovered in woodland yesterday.
'Poppy Johnston is still missing.'
So, let me guess -- coppers.
How's the holiday in Murder Town?
I mean, no-one really knows anyone, do they?
Do you ever think about what happened all them years ago?
So, is it mine?
I used to come here when I was younger.
It wasn't deserted then.
We used to go crazy in those cornfields.
I was younger -- getting off with boys, fumbling around like we knew what we were doing...
And this is relevant, is it?
To you being pregnant with my kid.
It's not yours.
Ah, come on!
You know, you think I was unhappy, but maybe it was the opposite.
Maybe I was just terrified of the happiness I was feeling.
Does he know about us?
What do you think?
How about I tell him?
.. that I want to be a part of its life.
And I want to be a part of yours.
As most of you will already know, Stephen Bates, the man we believe to be responsible for the murder of Abigail Toms, is now on remand awaiting trial.
While I commend Detective Inspector Cornish and his team for their excellent work on this tragic case, we must not lose sight of the fact that there is an inquiry still ongoing, so Poppy's parents, Michael and Annette,
are going to make a short statement, after which I will be happy to answer any questions.
Stephen Bates has persistently refused to tell police where our daughter is.
So today we are appealing to anyone who might know anything to please come forward and help police find Poppy.
She has been missing for five days now and we are desperate to hear from her.
Poppy is only 16 years old and it's completely out of character for her to leave home without telling us.
And we just want her...
All I am saying is just go home -- let me have my space -- and then when I'm back in Manchester, you know, we...
Oh, shit!
What's wrong?
'I'm at the hospital.'
Stephen Bates tried to kill himself.
Right, OK.
Thanks for letting me know, I'll be over there as soon as I can.
What?
I've got to go -- you need to get out.
Well, ring a cab.
I don't have a number.
You need to tell him about us and about the baby.
And you need to decide what future you want.
Hey.
He got hold of a ballpoint pen, tried to do his wrists.
Is he all right?
No-one'll talk to me.
No-one'll tell me anything.
Looks like he was trying to take the easy way out, don't it?
That's what they'll say, isn't it?
They'll say that in the papers.
Still think he didn't do it?
Admit it doesn't exactly scream innocence.
But right now the entire country thinks he's a child-killer.
How do you think that feels?
Pretty terrible.
Yeah, especially if it's not true.
Thought you'd been warned off.
Cornish told me he'd told you to go home.
Helen, people's careers can get ruined by stuff like this.
'You have two new messages and five saved messages.
'Bye.
Paul, we need to talk.
I really messed up, Paul, and, er... .. I really hope this baby's yours, but...
All right, this is intimidation, so if you don't get out of my way, now, I'm...
Helen Weeks!
Paul asked me to come.
Oh, not the countryside as such, just everyone in it.
And how often do you find out that one of your best friends is having a... cause for a celebration?
I demand Champagne immediately, or, er, failing that, several pints of strong Continental lager.
Shall we?
I'd love to.
Hey!
What is this place?
Hell on Earth.
So, I popped in to see the coroner and I saw the body.
How did you do that?
What can I say, the guy must've liked me, I have a certain charm.
He tried to top himself, couldn't live with it.
Looks like they've got their man.
So, how is the body?
Not a lot left of her, to be honest -- most of the skin had been removed by insect invasion.
Tell me about the report.
Phillip!
What?
What about time of death?
Three weeks, give or take.
And this is where our creepy crawlies come in.
Three different types of insect were found in the remains.
Yes, I know, but, er... we're all just insect feed in the end.
Oh, cheery!
Right, well, er, time for a tinkle.
Oh, ye of little faith.
Hiya.
Phil, great to see you.
Oh, cheers.
Ah, nice and cool.
I could never have piercings -- scared of the pain.
It's the pain that enhances the pleasure, if you have it in the right place.
Interesting job you got.
Oh, yeah, hanging out with dead people all day.
Yes, well, it pays very well but the conversation's often lacking.
It's amazing what they can do now, with all this tech.
I suppose you got to be smart these days to be a criminal.
You just need a detective with a massive ego who's happy to bang up the wrong person.
Cheers, everyone.
It's been a long day.
Oh, come on, the party's just getting started.
Right, let's crack out the poppers!
What do you think's going on?
Her father lives here, her sister visits.
Yeah, yes, the labyrinthine maze that is Helen's psyche.
Oof!
Bollocks!
God love the countryside.
So let's assume she wasn't dead three or four weeks.
In fact, nothing like four weeks.
How do you make a body that's actually relatively fresh look as though it's been rotting for a while?
Well, never mind how -- why?
Well, to falsify the time of death, I imagine, but in that case... why burn the body?
Well, I was hoping you'd have an answer.
Well, it's just a theory, but, er, to open it up.
I think he burned the body just enough to open it up.
For what?
To put the bugs in.
OK, so, I'm him, I'm the killer, right?
I burn the body, open up the skin, expose the muscles, organs, whatever...
Not forgetting to put the fag end in with Stephen Bates's DNA all over it.
Maybe I followed him, watched him drop it in the gutter.
Possibly.
Right, so, where does he get them all from?
All these flies, maggots, different kinds of beetles.
Internet?
I've checked his history.
You're not normal.
Thought it was you.
Gavin.
This is, er, Phil -- he's a colleague of mine from Manchester.
You bringing the whole force down?
You know this used to be a nice town, before all this!
Now all we've got are pigs and hacks everywhere.
Ah, he seems like a nice chap!
You really ought to get us together for dinner some time.
Well, you're here for Helen.
And I'm here to escape a large Nigerian man named Reuben who seems to think we're in a relationship.
Are we being followed?
Relax.
How's Stephen?
Better -- he's out of hospital.
They still won't let me see him, though, or the kids.
It's killing 'em.
I know.
They shouldn't have to go through this, because it's hard for them to accept this hate towards him.
It's the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
Is it... the worst?
I feel so guilty, Linda, for leaving.
It's a long time ago.
I was a coward.
That's shit.
You had the chance and you got out, and if I...
God, if I'd've had that same chance I would've done exactly the same.
I thought you'd hate me.
I was scared to death coming down here, I thought you'd...
Yes?
Oh!
Sorry for staring.
I'm sorry -- we're in the middle of something here, private, so...
Oh, I just wanted to say, Linda, I know who you are and I understand.
Thank you.
And if you ever want to talk...
I appreciate it.
Which paper are you from?
I beg your pardon?
Which newspaper?
The-The Post!
Why don't you get out of here before I shove those stupid glasses up your bony tabloid arse?
Scum.
"Bony tabloid arse"?
You're a good friend.
No, I... and I never blamed you.
We were both victims.
But... .. it's because of me.
He got to you through me.
No.
Who told Adam?
Some prick at work, Mickey.
No, listen, don't interrupt.
If it all blows up,
I'm going to need somewhere to stay for a few days.
Yeah, of course, but you're going to tear your life apart, throw everything away, and he doesn't need to know.
God, you're gorgeous.
I'm trying to belch.
Yeah, I know, that's when I like you best.
So, where are you taking me tonight, then?
Thought we'd try this new vegetarian place, Green Tomato.
Oh, right, OK, town famous for its pork and you want to go veggie!
No, it's Phil, he'll be fine.
He was amazing yesterday, you know.
He's got a brain the size of a planet.
So he thinks it's all about the insects, does he?
Yeah, yeah, placed inside the body.
It would require some pretty specialist knowledge,
I mean, let alone where you'd actually acquire them from.
A layman just wouldn't know that stuff.
Shit.
Pig farms.
You what?
The killer wouldn't need to buy the bugs, he could harvest them.
Right, I spent some time on farms growing up.
What happens when you let an animal corpse decompose?
Oh, shit!
That's it -- the weird farmer, the guy in the bar, accusing everyone of stealing his piglets.
Ah, pigs!
I do love pigs, me!
I say pigs, I mean sausages.
So, er... why don't we have, er, guide pigs?
We could -- easily.
Sniffer pigs?
Want a description?
Oh, no, I think-I think we know what a pig looks like.
Know what a Saddleback looks like?
Thought not.
This isn't a big operation.
And you say it happened overnight, yeah?
Well, it was there last time I changed the feed, gone the next morning.
You don't have electric fences, anything like that?
Er, yeah, yeah, at the pub -- you came in accusing Trevor, the landlord.
Could be him, easy, amount of pork he serves, and that cook he's got, Shelley, cut-price bloody Shakespeare -- if he's such a good poet, why's he cooking sausages?
Somebody steals my pigs, it's like mugging me in the street.
Well, thank you very much.
We'll let you know if we hear anything.
Why would someone go to all that trouble to implicate Bates?
Well, so that everyone thinks that Bates is the killer, which is exactly what the real killer wants.
But he can't get away with killing a second time, not with Bates in custody.
That was your lovely friend.
Gavin.
Shall we follow him?
He's been acting suspicious -- he was parked up by the woods the other night.
Oh, we will claim coincidence.
There he is.
Isn't this fun?
Yeah, that's him!
What the hell is he doing?
Only one way to find out.
Hey, listen, just remember you're pregnant, all right, so if it kicks off, leave it to us.
All right, so now what?
Right, we follow him inside,
Wait here.
Shit!
OK, OK...
Look, it was just a bit of robbing.
They're insured.
It's the Poppy and Abi show, isn't it?
Everyone's making a nice bit of coin out of it.
Oh, you should be ashamed of yourself.
Yeah, well, thanks for that, school bully.
You, you don't know anything about me, or anything about my life back then, so why don't you just shut your stupid trap?
I've got to go back up to Manchester.
I was working on.
Can you stay tonight and go back tomorrow morning?
Maybe we could have dinner tonight together.
Is everything all right?
Hey, what's wrong?
Look, Helen, whatever it is, just spit it out.
Just don't think I'm ready to be a mother.
Y'know, coming back here and seeing all this pain and anguish, it's like people make themselves vulnerable just by having kids, just by loving something that much.
I need the loo.
You've just been!
Yeah, but I've got a baby pressing down on my bladder!
I saw your picture in the paper.
Right.
You're a friend of Linda Bates.
And?
Can we talk?
This is a bit of a nightmare, actually, you being a friend of Steve's wife, but I'm hoping you'll help me.
Help you?
Prove he didn't kill anyone.
Why do you think he didn't kill anyone?
Because... .. that night everyone reckons he took Abigail Toms, he was with me.
It was me he was meeting in that pub.
So you, you and Steve, you were together?
Yeah.
We had to meet in places a bit out the way.
So you have an alibi for him?
Well, sort of.
He didn't have time to get back to Polesford and kill someone.
Well, why not go to the police?
I'm only 16.
How long have you been seeing each other?
We didn't do anything, you know, sexual, not until my birthday.
OK, there's no... no need to get upset.
I'm shitting myself, cos you know what they'll say, they'll say, "Well, there you are, then, he was into young girls,
"it's proof, he did it with Abigail and Poppy as well,
"but he killed them -- you could've been next,"
but that's crap, he's not like that.
OK, I understand, but you know we need to take this to the police?
What did you say your name was again?
Well, Aurora.
Blame my parents.
Harcross?
Argh!
You learn some respect.
.. always meet outside of Polesford... .. the night Abi was taken...
You don't believe her, do you?
What's she got to gain?
She's got text after text proving the affair.
She gives Bates a rock-solid alibi for the time you've got him murdering Abigail Toms.
You're determined to prove me wrong, aren't you?
Oh, my God.
It's not about you.
Why don't you see what's staring you straight in the face?
You will not be the star of this investigation if you convict an innocent man.
Would you rather she take her story straight to the papers?
Ah, by the way, your mate Linda's here.
Would you like to be the one to tell her?
I don't think so.
Oh, and you'd know, would you?
I know it can't be easy to hear, but it can't hurt to have an alibi.
Can't hurt?
How would you feel if some little slut came along saying she was screwing your Paul, saying she loved him?
I would be upset.
But given these particular circumstances,
I would rather he was a shagger than a killer.
What am I going to tell the kids?
I don't know.
How can we tell Charli I know her stepdad's innocent cos he was with a girl younger than she is?
She's young.
Know your enemy.
We learned that a long time ago, didn't we?
Who is she?
Helen, please tell me, what's her name?
You don't want to know.
I s'pose that's why I never came forward earlier, because I knew they wouldn't believe me.
Went out together a few times.
Bonded when we found out we had matching rose tats.
Tit tats, she called 'em, because they were... you know... there.
I can't believe she's dead.
Thanks, anyway.
Gosh...
Aurora?
Who, erm, who lives with you in that house?
My-my dad -- why?
Do you ever see your grandad?
I used to know him.
Bye.
Oh, for God's sake, Helen!
I know there's something.
I don't want to discuss it.
We're having a child together, Helen, in case you'd forgotten --
I think that bonds us pretty tightly, don't you, so if there's any secrets, if there's something that you're not telling me...
Helen!
Helen!
I was 13 years old and his name was Peter Harcross.
Harcross?
Yeah, him.
He was a friend of my dad's and my dad was a single father and my mum had died and my dad didn't know how to cope and Peter pretended to be a helping hand and he knew that my dad was gay, and he used that against me.
He said if I ever told anyone he would ruin him -- he would make sure that everyone knew, and he was a councillor and my dad was still in the closet back then.
Helen, come here!
No.
He would turn up at the house and he would pretend to be surprised that my dad wasn't in.
He would help himself to a beer and he would sit down next to me and he would rub my leg and-and I was so shit scared that she would be next and I swore, I swore that I would never...
I'd never let him get to her and he said... he said that
I had to keep loving him or he'd try someone else, and I knew he meant her.
That's how he would describe it.
"Loving him."
Like-like loving means lying still like you're dead and throwing your guts up after then running home so fast you can't feel your legs any more.
And Paula...
Paula...
Paula calls me a bully.
I was looking after them.
I was a bitch to her and Jenny because I was trying to protect them.
Like I hadn't with Linda.
Hey, hey, no.
No.
Helen, Helen, Helen, look at me, look at me.
Hey, you haven't fucked up every relationship, OK?
Not for long.
What do you mean?
What're you saying, Helen?
I slept with someone.
Adam Perrin.
And-and it didn't mean anything much, it was just screwing, but...
Fuck!
And don't ask me for reasons, because I've got none.
He was there and I fancied him and I knew it would mess everything up but I didn't stop myself because I couldn't, like I have never been able to.
The baby...
Tell me it's not his.
Helen, tell me.
I don't know.
Oh, shit!
Adam Perrin?
I'm sorry.
I've got to go back to Manchester.
No, Paul...
Just leave me alone!
Please... just... stay...
'Tit tats, she called them cos they were...' you know... there.
What!
Paul, Paul, I know...
I know who killed Abigail Toms.
'Lovely girl, that Abigail.'
She had one of them stupid tattoos they all have... huge rose.
'That's like goody two shoes round here.'
Where's Trevor?
You can't go up there!
Helen!
Right, he's heading for the lower villages, and there's only one road there, so I think we could catch him.
Trevor knew about Abigail's tattoo.
Plus, he's ex-police so he knows all about DNA and time of death scenarios.
And he's had all the coppers in his pub so he's had the inside track on everything.
Hiding in plain sight.
More than that -- flaunting it.
Telling people he used to give Abigail and Poppy lifts in his car, and it explains the fag end, too.
He knew exactly what he was up to with Rory, and knew he could set him up.
There he is.
I love you.
I know this road, I know where he's going.
To the old pumping station.
Come on, it's this way.
You OK?
Yeah, it's not far.
Why the hell didn't they search this place when they first came?
Probably under five foot of water.
Helen, be careful.
Oh, God.
Trevor!
Stop!
You shouldn't've come here.
You've put me in a terrible position.
Because now there aren't many options.
I love her.
You let us go or I will kill her.
You try and stop me and I will kill you.
It's all over, Trevor.
No, it's not.
You OK?
Watch out!
It's my fault.
He was my friend, that...
My little girl.
My little girl.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so, sorry.
You're not supposed to be here until after the Trevor Hare investigation.
Yeah, I'm not here for that.
I'm here for something else.
I want to report a historic case of child abuse.
Against who?
Me.
How historic?
20-odd years ago.
And the perpetrator?
Peter Harcross.
He was a local councillor in my hometown, works in Hull now, few years off retirement.
Local government?
Mm-hm.
I'm so sorry you've had to live with this.
You've seen me... .. drug dealers, criminals, I can stand up to them...
.. but... .. that man...
Paul, please... please come home.
Let's-let's at least try?
Do you know, Helen, right now I can't even look at you.
Mikey, I've got a problem.
Right, we're going to find who did it and hit back.
The business carries on as usual.
Every time he looks at me it's like I've got "whore" written across my forehead.
You want a relationship with a woman
Stay away from Frank Linnell.
How much blood is there?
There can't be... a problem.
