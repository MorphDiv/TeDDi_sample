I'm gonna steal this picture right out from under your nose, and you know I can do it.
Are you threatening me?
Bette and Joan.
All-new, Sunday at 10:00 on FX.
FX presents the Americans.
Previously on "The Americans"...
We captured Irina in Brazil.
I know you spoke to her about two years ago.
That's my son.
Our son.
Mischa.
If your people know that certain things are happening, that treaties are being broken, maybe they'll stop.
He gave me enough pieces to put something together...
Probably an agent in place, working on biological weapons.
With William under arrest, you're in immediate danger.
I think it's time.
But, of course, it's your decision.
It's...

No!
You guys said you were done lying to me.
You don't need to know everything.
You just killed a man in front of me.
I might as well know everything.
You should go get Paige.
Okay, let's go, sweetie.
Bye.

I don't want you to see him.
That's ridiculous.
You have no idea.
No idea.
Hey, man.
Pavel, right?
Yes.

Pasha or Pavel?
Friends call "pasha."
I'm Tuan.
So, are you new?
Two months.
I just started.
It's rough.
From where?
Michigan.
You?
Soviet union.
Yeah, I got that.
Where in the Soviet union?
Moscow.
How's the English coming?
Okay understand.
Speak, not so good.
Yeah, it's hard.
I remember.
Come on.
You want a banana?
- Hey, mom.

- Who's your friend?

Hi, pasha.

Mr. Eckert.
Hey, Stan.
Oleg Burov got on a plane to Moscow last night.
- Alone?

Okay.
So...

Or they're calling him back, and they're going to arrest him when he lands.
They'd have to put a hell of a lot of pieces together to tie William Crandall to Oleg talking to you, especially this fast.
Yeah.
Likely they're just turning over staff since the Rezident got png'ed.
There's that.
He took a big risk for his conscience.
That's his choice.
Now, next time you think you want to take somebody out, pal...
- Hey.

-Get yourself a team.
Good episode?
It's stupid.
The kids at school like it.

I was over at pasha's again yesterday.
The same car was out there, a block and a half east of the house.
Not hiding.

- Same driver?

This kid...

Hates it here more than me.
His English sucks.

Anyway, I can get you in there pretty easy.
Next time I'm over, just drop in front of the parents we're both new in the neighborhood.
Yeah, that sounds right.

- We have time with this one.

I think I have a pretty good feel for them.
They're so grateful someone's talking to their kid, especially his mom.

Always hovering, which the dad hates.
This dad is a real piece of shit.
Hates his homeland, where he comes from.
Don't know how you people let a guy like that get out.
Should've put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
Anybody been over?
Nope.

Where you guys flying to this week?
Uh, you choose.
- Paris.

So he goes to Paris, you go to Bombay.
- Sounds good.

Ah.
Mm.
Hello?
- Hi.

What's that?
Mario's, for lunch tomorrow.
Now Stan's buying you lunch?
He's eaten like 100,000 meals over here.
I don't think he minds my taking a few slices of leftover pizza.
He ever give you any vegetables?
On the pizza.
You want some dessert?
- No, I'm stuffed.

- You want to watch with us?

No, thanks.
Really, I-i-i would never ask out a stewardess that... that works for me.
No.

Yeah...

- Yeah.

And I thought this life of his was so glamorous...
- All the travel, and...

Now I'm on the road four nights a week, and I have to wear these tight, tight uniforms,
- and I can't gain any weight.

- for jerks like me.

- work for the pilots.

Can I have some more stew, please?

Yes.
Leave him alone.
English, English, English.
Good thing you don't work for Aeroflot.
- Mm.

The planes are dirty, the passengers are unhappy, and planes crash.
Well, just like the whole country...
Dirty, unhappy, and crashing.
- Loesha, mm?

You want food, you stand in line.
Do you see any lines for food here?

You go to store, they have so much of everything.
It's a beautiful sight.

You would not believe what you see in Soviet union.
That bad?
We share apartment with three families.
- Mm.

You want phone, you pay bribe.

Phone breaks, you... you bribe.
Heat breaks, you... you bribe.
What did you do there?
Complain.

I am a consultant to your department of agriculture.
- Ah.

- Hey.

Matthew's getting out of the shower.
He should be down in a sec.
Is Henry coming?
- In a minute.

Where's he been lately?
Just, uh, busy with school.
Oh.
Hey,
I don't want to embarrass you or anything, but I just...
I just wanted to say, it was tough for Matthew when he started spending more time here, and you guys made it a lot easier, so...
Maybe your parents should move in.
We can be one big, happy family.
Maybe they can move in, and I can move out.
Oh, are they being a pain in the ass?
Well, you know how parents are.
I've heard.
- Hey.

Uh, dinner should be ready in five minutes.
- Your hair's wet.

I like it.
Hello?
Henry!
- Hey.

Hey.
Hey, why don't you guys set the table?
Okay.

I'm sorry.
He talk, he... he...
Gets excited?
- Yes.

Oh, he champion.
How do you like it here?
Different.
But, um, at home, not bad, like Alexei say.
It's not easy being in a new place.
I was really worried about Tuan...
Uprooting him in the middle of a school year and bringing him someplace new, with us working so much.
At least you're home if pasha needs you.
Yeah, but I want work.
You no like your work?
Oh, I don't know.

I don't mean to complain.
I get to read a lot on long flights, which is kind of nice.
Ah, I like read.
I want to get job in library, but, ugh, English, no good.
Your English is good.
Pasha, too, no good English.
Tuan good boy.
- Mm.

Mm.

Tuan, um, uh, speak, um, English before?
No.

When we adopted him, he didn't speak any English.
Oh.

He was 10.
So it takes time.
Pasha will learn.
I hope.
Not happy.
Pasha...
Don't want go to America like father.
It's hard to see them like that.
I know.
Tuan really struggled in the beginning, too, but you just have to be patient.
He'll figure it out.
You will, too.
We're studying tomorrow afternoon.
I'll make it at his place.
Good.
How do you do the lights?
Well, right now, I assume that someone sees you both leaving, so I just turn off the lights.
On other nights, I'll stagger them.
I'll do the living room and kitchen an hour before I go to bed, then your bedroom lights after that.
Great.

Okay.

Can't wait to have dinner with that family again.
Yeah.
Sorry he had to wait in line to eat.
He's old enough to remember having nothing to wait in line for.
My mother used to make a soup from a few onions, nothing else.
It was really just hot water.
After the war, my mother always said she wasn't hungry.
I knew...
But I ate everything.
She was so thin.
We'll get another chance to go home.
Wasn't the right time.
What's the right time?
What are you reading?
Cookies?

No.

Still no vegetables, but I think he's on the right track.
- Henry's in his room.

Were you working?
- Yes.

Was, uh,...

Where?
You know where.
I mean, it's his house.
Were you alone with him?
We just...
We just talked.
About what?
How much we hate gym class, Michael Jackson, church.
And then I came home, made cookies, and I did my homework.
I wish this were simple, Paige.
I wish...

- and just the usual problems.

There are other boys, Paige.
I don't...

I've got bigger problems.
I can't sleep at night.
I have nightmares.
I keep seeing that guy and that knife in his neck.
- Honey...

Do you think about it?
It will get better.

I don't want it to get better.
You don't want me to see Matthew,
I'm too scared to go to the food pantry alone, and none of it is supposed to...
I...
Hi.
Hi.
Bad timing?
Perfect timing.
Don't forget the lights.
Vegetables, Stan...

- Night.

- Vegetables?

Little kids, little problems.
- Big kids...

Sandra used to say...

She used to say, "the problem with putting your foot down"
is, you just pick it up."
- She was a smart woman.

Hey, this thing with...

How much of a "thing" is it?
Well, Matthew's happy.
Paige is a great kid...

- There are others?

So...
I met someone.
- A woman?

- Where?

I was lifting, and she was riding an exercise bike in a purple leotard, which she wore very well.
- You go up to her?

But I think she either smiled at me or she caught me looking at her and was grossed out.
- You couldn't tell?

But when she passed me at the water cooler,
- I handed her a cup of water.

- Yep.

So, when you say you "met someone"...
Uh, did you ask her out?
No.

- You didn't get her name.

My brain was all over the place.
But I'm going to the gym every day now.
I'm gonna be in the best shape of my life.
Stan was in a chipper mood.
He likes some woman at the gym.
He thinks Paige and Matthew is a good thing.
- Why?

Stan's gonna be heartbroken when it doesn't work out.
It's gonna get worse, with the two of them.
She won't listen to me.
I'll talk to her.
They got him out of the hospital, got him a job at a good factory.
Apparently, they got word he hadn't been coming to work.
They went to find him.

What?
They think he's coming here?
It's one possibility...
To find his father.
When William was caught, I told him to get out...
That they should go home.
On your own, or you had permission from the centre?
And?
They're still here.
Nothing scares those two.
Everything scares those two.
- Hey.

I want to help you with your nightmares.
Hey!
- Mom!

Mom, stop!
- What the hell?

You can't be afraid to be hit, and you can't be afraid to hit, ever.

You have to be willing to do anything to protect yourself.
Put your hand up.
Make a fist.
Thumb here, always.
That's good.
Got it yet?
New safe house address.
Mm.
I showed Paige some basic self-defense.
She's fast.
Did you talk to her about Matthew yet?
Not yet.
I will.
We think we know what happened to William.
They arrested him.
Somehow, he infected himself with the virus he was carrying, probably so they couldn't interrogate him.
They took him to their bio-containment facility at Fort Detrick, and we assume he died there.
Lassa fever...
How bad is it to...
We doubted him.
And then he killed himself for us.
I saw him back home, married, with some little kids running circles all around him.
I really wanted to get him that.
He's a hero.
Maybe he'll get a stamp.
Well, I'm afraid he has one last job.
This is called area "B."
It's in the back of fort Detrick.
Their next pass is in 20 minutes.
What are they driving?
Jeeps.

Okay.
It's okay.

- It doesn't hurt.

You go up.

Take an hour of his time.
Wow.

Someone's been busy.
Clearly not in ours.

Yeah.
I forget your back is always bad this time of year.
Only when there are leaves...
When did you wash this last?
- David?

Don't touch me!
- Legion.

All new Wednesdays at 10:00.

Now, what kind of a clown do you think you are?
You know, the sad clown, the distraught clown.
More like a dead-inside clown.
Beautiful!
Bette and Joan.
