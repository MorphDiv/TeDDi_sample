Previously on Wynonna Earp.
I beliefe your sister knows where the last seal is.
Give it to me, and I'll save your little lover's life.
- Trust us.

- My price'll be steep.

Doc's ring?

Waverly... what did you do?
- That.

Hands off that trophy, witch!
No!
- You two Earp girls...

I know what we need to do...
- Wynonna!

No idea!

Wynonna!
Get in that barn!

Guys!

It's too late!

No!

Guys, we're not going to die.
Jesus!

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!
- I know how to get her back.

Wynonna.

Wynonna?

Please, help!

Hey, Boss.

Why did you... call me?
You said you didn't wanna see my face.
- Until you found it, Boss.

Somethin' wrong with that ladder?
So, did you?
- What's that?

Peacemaker?
Mother of Pearl, no!

I do not give two shits about that ring right now.
Sure.
It's not like you slashed eight of our guys since it went missing.
Something's missing alright.
Take me to the Earp homestead.
That name's been banned, on threat of ballcrushing death.
Your words.
Well if they are my words, then it is my rule, seems only I can break them.
- You got it, Joey?

Joey's fine.
And for god sakes...
Somebody put a lid on that thing.
Aagh!
Shipment went out today, no trouble, Boss.
"Boss"?
The Boss?
Old Gramps out at the Hitchens place threatened us with a Blue Light Special, but I shot this off.
Let's just say that he's got two bad ears now.
Did you skim any of my payment from said shipment?
No Boss!
Please, not like Wayne.
Who's that now?
She's at it again.

You know how stubborn she is.
Well, that I certainly do.
You want me to take care of her?
Hey!

Wynonna?
I'm going to need another poster.
This one's nearly out of face.
Rosita!

Cooking product that you don't deserve to sell.
I need your help.
Wynonna and the baby, they've been taken...
I told you, if you ever touched me,
I'd poison the lot of you.
You're shackled.
- Did I do this?

Who's Wynonna?
In a different world, my hand was on the trophy when Gretta cast the spell, made Wynonna vanish...
Or did she ever even exist?
Seriously, Boss?
Have you been snorting too much of your own product?
I must've gotten myself out of the well, rallied this sad ballsack of a gang.
Without her I'm...
What are...
- What are you doing?

Waverly Earp.

- I know a Waverly Gibson.

Yeah, Deputy Marshall Dolls.
He'll shoot you on sight.
So some things haven't changed.
I need to speak with him immediately.
Yeah, well, you better bring backup then.
Or something that will make him listen.
She's vanished.
We're free.
You're gonna tell me what I need to know, or you'll die trying.
Without her, you will all die.
Who?
Remind me again, how did you capture me?
We followed your trail of dead priests, construction workers, and...
Marvelous.
Doesn't matter.

Yeah, and why you're destroying consecrated ground.
Also, there's a lot of creatures making their way to the Ghost River Triangle.
Why?

You're the one who should be searching for something.
Let me give you a hint...
It's a woman.
Beth?
Yeah.

You're so close!
It's going to be like Christmas, watching you writhe.
Doc Holliday.

Dolls...
- What happened to your face?

And I cannot wait to return the favor.
You shoot me, it's gonna be one hell of an explosion.
Yeah, I've seen your work up close.
Are you here to confess, about the power plant?

Nedley's house?
- Sheriff Nedley?

No, I would never!
My God...
Is this what we are without her?
Her?
She was...
She was everything!

Are you gonna make a demand?
Because if you're gonna make it, make it now, before I shoot that compensating moustache off your smirking face.
I want you to remember.
We have the Doc Holliday in custody.
My gosh!

Put him in there with whatever she is.
Well, what if she eats him?
Well, it's like black widows in a jar, Jeremy.
May the best bitch win.
Lonnie, why am I holding a missing person report with the word "person" scratched out and "pug" written above?
Mrs. Grandeur's dog disappeared.
I don't know why anybody would keep a dog in purgatory, though.
- What, with all those coyotes.

Right.

You really gotta pay attention.
God, I'm trying my best Old Man, but... damn, I miss you.
Chicken salad.
But I added pickles.

- I love 'em.

Food's not moving like it used to,
- so we're pits deep in 'em.

You put your face on a shorty's sign, we're gonna have a tidal wave of new purgatorians!
I might have to put my face on the "now leaving purgatory" sign.
- You're really doin' it?

It's time, you know.

It's real.
Hey!

'Cause I need to fill out a change of name form.
I haven't-

Phone, Lonnie.

Purgatory police department.
OK!
Waverly Gibson.
Date of birth:
- September 8th.

Um... yeah, I guess I do.
Well, little known fact.
My real last name is Earp.
Yeah.

- So, I sort of borrowed the name.

The name Earp.

I like this!
It's simple.
The one thing marriage is not.
Why am I wearing this?
Well...
A fresh start.
I'd be a fool not to marry him.

As long as you believe it, in your heart.
I sort of feel like I'm, you know...
Running towards a cliff, terrified of jumping, but...
Well, if it's right, you don't think about the cliff because you're sure when you reach the edge, you'll fly.
If you go off a cliff, don't you die?
He's outside.
- Thanks for this.

You gonna eat those pickles?

- You don't like 'em.

Every second she is gone is another we are doomed.
Dolls!

- Now, come on!

Such pretty names for such pretty corpses!
You stay away from me, you ripe slag!
All out of poison, are we?
How did you know?
Because Dolls would never place me in here if there was a real chance of death!
- He hates your gangster guts!

So you see it, too, John Henry?

Without the heir here to stop us, we will resurrect our husband and have the party of the century.
All are invited.
Few will survive.
Not if I can get outta here!
And I will get outta here!
Me, too.
And when that useless cword of a sister finally realizes how much she needs me...
I will.
I admit it, I'm gonna miss that shirt.
Really?

What?
You talk about how much you hate purgatory, but deep down, you're gonna miss it.
Please.
Once we leave, I can finally finish my history degree, and not by doing online courses.
I can... go to India, Spain...
And I want to take you.
But I want to make sure you're ready.
We've been through this three times.
Three wedding dresses, three venues.
I know.

It's just... something always seems to be missing.
Yeah.

A few months ago, I hired a P.I. to look into your Dad's and Willa's murders.
I didn't want to get your hopes up, so I never said anything.
Because knowing something about me before me is a total invasion of my privacy!

Sorry.
I don't know where that came from.
Waves... the investigator found someone.
The man who killed your family.
He was found wandering back into purgatory, disoriented.
What?
Two weeks before our wedding?
What are the odds?
- So, where is he now?

He's, um... he's been asking for you.
You checked all metal items at the front desk?
Yeah, but they didn't tell me why.
You have 10 minutes.
Hello.
My name is Waverly Gibson...
No.
Waverly Earp.
How on earth could I forget?

You're my angel.
I came back, but it's all different.
Why?
My father and sister are still dead.
You killed them,
- made me an orphan.

No...
No.
Your sister killed your father, and my Willa.
- What?

Why did you come back to purgatory?
That is not the question.
The question is:
Why now?
I was in hell.
Only an Earp heir can put me there.
Not your father, he was dead.
But if I came back... she must have gotten dead.
Is she dead?
I don't know who you're talking about.
No... no.
Wynonna.

It's Wynonna!
OK!

- Who is Wynonna?

No.
I had one sister.
Willa.
And you slaughtered her!
Yes.
It's a spell.
A flimsy one, but...
She's only shaded.

- Don't.

Move.
Don't go.

That night on the homestead.
They killed everyone...
But me.
- Why?

My words.

You're my angel.
Fly, fly away... and make Wynonna missing no more.
Rise, my demon, my husband, my master.
Show of yourself and come to reclaim, all that was lost you shall once more regain.
Break, damn it!
I'm so sorry, my darling.
Of course.

Boo.
"The Earp curse."
Bullshit.
That was adorable.
Hey, watch out!
Just once, can I get some bullets that work?

The beginning is nigh!

So specific.
OK.
Hey, hey, hey!
Put the gun down.
Jeremy, I keep telling you, you won t hit your target if you put all your weight on your back leg.
What?

- Dolls won't even tell me!

We are living in an alternate reality.
Like The Matrix?
Do you even remember how you came to be working in purgatory?
Yeah!

I think.

Maybe I was...
Maybe I was transferred, or...
A spell has been spun, making enemies of old friends.
I know who you are, Jeremy.
You're a vegetarian with ethics of steel that still reads.
Doctor Strange comic books at night because he wants to be a hero.
What?
The explosives that you strapped on had...
Had... no wires.
No detonator.

I could use a good man to make this right.
A hero.
Yeah!

Yeah, for sure.
But, Dolls is gonna kill me.
He would never trust me.
- Get my coat.

I gotta go to Shorty's.

Hey!

Yeah.

I used to hate you for leaving, Mama.
But I get it now.
This town is too hard.
You've got five seconds to vamoose before I blow your head off!
- Waverly.

No.

- I'm getting married.

What?

Lord, please tell me there is a part of you that knows me.
I know you're a criminal.

You are not wrong, but believe me when I say I am done with that life.
We need to find the Trophy and bring her back...
Hey!
Keep your hands up, Holliday.
I'm afraid the stakes are too high, Xavier.
Jeremy told you where I am?
Agent Chetri committed treason.
- Did he mention why?

I do not want a fight, you stubborn bastard.
Good.

Check what's left of your soul.

You've torn this town apart!
- It was the damn demons!

And I've recently retired.

Leave me out of this!
This is not who you are, Dolls!
You're a good man!

- but a good man.

How did you know?

I don't want to be a dick, but I can outdraw you anywhere, anyhow.
Fine.
- Then shoot me.

I would prefer not to, but I'm on a tight schedule.
Dolls!

It's nothing that won't heal.
You'll be up and cursing my name in no time.
And I am gonna make this right, partner.
II do hate it when we argue.
You look so beautiful in that dress.
- It was my mother's.

Listen to me.

You destroy the trophy;

I don't know who that is!
She's the only one that can save us from all this, baby... girl.
What did you call me?
Thanks for coming to get me.
Standard operating procedure.
We both know, that's not true.
I don't know what's...

Hey!

He's violent and insane a huge part of the reason why purgatory went to shit...
But when he died...
Have you ever met someone and instantly known in your heart that they meant something to you?
I might kinda get that, yeah.
God!
He told me to find the Iron Witch.
The way he said it, I...
I think he meant an actual witch.
That's crazy, right?

It's supernatural central.
I've never heard anyone say that out loud before!
God!

So, look.

- who that might be?

And would it be so illegal for you to get me her address?
Super illegal.
But, you know, if I just happened to blow off work and we sort of pass by...
You'd do that, for me?
- I'd do a lot of things to you.

Yup!

You know, sheriff Haught?
You always smell like vanilla dip donuts.
They're my favorite.
Dolls?
- Dolls!

Help!
Hey, it'll be fine.
God.

- for a shoulder wound...

- It's too late, alright?

- Don't say that!

- What?

Complete the mission, OK?
I killed him!
I killed Doc.
But it felt... empty.
I think he was my friend.
Wait, Dolls.
Wynonna...
No, no, no!

So, you think this world is under a spell?
What, like Narnia or MaraLago?
- Sorry, it's... it's just...

Why would you wish for something like this?
Hey, I don't get it either.
Look at me!

And Mattie's still dead.
Mattie Perley.
Your sister.

What, the serial killer?
I'm so sorry.
I just wanted to change the past.
The entire timeline...

I wished your sister gone and...
The universe erased her entirely.
Wynonna?
Do you remember?
No.

Yeah. "People" touched by the demonic?
And Doc Holliday.
Your friend.
He grabbed the trophy at the exact moment I made the wish.
Kept him immune from it;
Helped him retain his memories.
This spell is only cheap glamour.
This demon is in way over his grain sack head.
The Marzaniok?
- OK.

- Just take your hands off her.

- I've waited too long.

- No!

OK, wait!
Look, I have been working on a reversal spell.
It's not much, but I can lift the glamour for several seconds.
Peel zuruck ist die falsche welt, in und die anderen!
My god.
This is my fault.
I gave you the trophy with the Marzaniok.
Because I tricked you.
And then Wynonna was erased.
Wynonna!
Warm and funny...
- Insanely protective.

And then...
I betrayed her.
Because I love you.
Wait.

Agh!

But not the memory of the memory.
So that was why.
Doc Holliday was looking for that trophy.
He wanted to break the spell.

Enough fire can break anything.

We'll never make it past the front gate.
That... the homestead's impenetrable.
That's what Daddy always said.
Then someone proved him wrong.
You said I was an angel.

Let's TBD that part for now.
Whatever my Angel wants.
To get on the Earp homestead.
You're too young to be the heir yet.
Where is the gun?
And your lineage isn't exactly pure...
Please!
- Concentrate.

OK?

Like you.
The talisman was never dug up.
Be a dear and...
Untie me?
I like your boots.

You lost, little boy?
Lower your weapon!
You greet a girl, you don't
- point your shooter at her.

Call me Rosie.
Deputy Marshall Dolls didn't make the rendezvous.
- Does that mean that he...

- How?

He's dead too.
Good.

Hey, I think Black Badge has been lying to us.
A Government Agency?

No.

Like a bunch of cursed outlaws who can't die?
And Holliday said the fabric of space and time has been compromised.

- That's crazy.

Tell me how you ended up working for Black Badge.
Tell me how you were embedded in Doc's gang.
Hell, tell me what you ate for breakfast.
I...
I...

No.

No, no, no.

Drugs?

Yes, exactly!

Dolls' life isn't the only one that's a lie.
Those bastards.
They're gonna pay for this.
Do you know how to wire RDX?
Can a Dothraki outride any knight in Westeros?
What?
Yes.

OK.
Rise, my Demon, my Husband, my Master.
Show of yourself and come to reclaim.
All that was lost you shall once more regain.
Why isn't it working?
Why is he silent?
Get up.
This spell that made the heir disappear?
There are holes in it.
We are running out of time.
Give me the rings.
Reveal thee, or be forever entombed.

Well?
Speak!
He's not here.

We have been betrayed.
Seems to run in the family.
Shut up.

You deserved to be left behind!
Where is our Husband, Sister?
I cannot say.
But the rings know who will.
Wait.
Wait.
No.

Bring the Sister, the Heir, back into existence...
Well, that would be tap, tap, tap, a nail in my coffin.
What is this, slam poetry night?
Ha.

You should keep her.
Bobo, please help me.
I know I said I would never hurt you.

Dig under the hamster.
Pikachu?
OK.
The talisman is neutralizing the ground.
Remove it, and Ammolite will be reactivated, and the revenants will be blown off the land, like dried leaves.
Robert.
Robert.
Faster.
Faster!
OK!
Bobo del freakin' Rey?
Holy shit, Bobo's back!
Boys, Bobo's back!

We follow Doc and Doc only.
Bobo's back, boys!
Fight for Bobo!

Fight for Bobo!

We need to fight for Doc!
How's it going down there?
The ground is frozen!
What the hell are you bitches doing?
- OK, we gotta go.

I'm not leaving without that trophy!

Go!

God, you're so cool, Haught!
My god!
OK, quick!
Go!

Do not shoot that thing in here or else this whole place blows!
'Cause there's drugs and explosives?

What are you, Jeremy?

I am barely a single agent!
Sheriff Haught, we believe Black Badge has gone rogue.
You think that's bad?

What?

Well, it's much worse than it sounds.
BBD is probably listening in right now.
Probably on their way here to annihilate us.
Naw, they'll just send in Tomahawk missiles.
Hi Per.
Yeah.

Listen, I can't really talk.

Also, I think I'm gay.

Hi, Robert.
Or do you prefer Bobo?
Well?

Where's a bear trap when you need one?
What has gotten hot sauce in their panties?
Victorian Secret models, Black Lace edition.
What, the... the widows?

And why do I suddenly know they're called the widows?
I'm not waiting to find out.

What?

- Whoa, no, no!

Get her!
What?
God!
- Is she...

Guys!

Get in that barn!

- Get in that barn!

- We're not going to make it.

I've only has sex one and a half times!
God, that was out loud.
- Guys, we're not gonna die.

I love your optimism, but...
But there's no way out.
Right.

- Knock it down!

- Jesus!

- I know how to get her back.

Wynonna.

What happens if we detonate the RDX?
- Your basic fire and brimstone.

- Then spell is broken.

OK.

Dying may be our only chance of living.
Who's in?
No, no, no.
Where you go, I go.
For Wynonna.
For Wynonna.
I don't even know who that is, and I don't even care...
God!

Yeah, for Wynonna!

Ooh!
Not dying single!

We're back...

- I am so, so sorry, times infinity!

Dolls, Doc... we have to find out if they made it.
We know Bobo did.
Or did he?
How can he even be back?
And, and, and which timeline are the widows in?
The thing is, we won't know if the spell was truly reversed
- until...

Until we find Wynonna.
The spell...
But I'm still here.
Not down there.
He's crazy.

In all the years
I spent digging for those bones of the old Stone Witch's sons.
I'm bored!
- Just torture him already.

Clootie's coffin.
You tell us where it is, or there will be no end to the cuts I make on this fragile body of yours.
No.
There is no pain and no torture that you can think of that I haven't already been through.
And I will not, and cannot, go back to hell.
And honey, old Clootie has the power to make sure I never do again.
We cannot make promises on behalf of our Lord.
But we're very good at convincing.
How can we possibly trust you, after everything you've done?
Byebye, seal number three.
I can feel him.

God, it's like your wedding night all over again.
Shall we?
Yeah.
Is a plate, which means if we...
Something's different.
For one thing, I've got grass in my thong.
Were you out, too?
This is nice.
What if we just stay here?
Just you and me?
Bobo?
I am a sucker for a reunion.
Shit.
The third seal.
They broke it.
Now we're all gonna buy it.
Not now.

Hold on.
