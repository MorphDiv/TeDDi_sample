Chrissy:

Clap those hands for your handsome host on the mic,
LL Cool J.
What up?

Now lemme hear you say, "Yeah!"
- Crowd:

Yo, tonight is crazy.
This is the renowned coliseum of competition where the biggest stars come to do musical battle all in an attempt to cement their mark as an LSB champion.
Now, before we bring out tonight's challengers,
I've got to introduce our sophisticated señorita.
Colorful commentator, the classy Chrissy Teigen.

Hey!

So, tonight is gonna be colossal, it's gonna be crazy.
- What do we expect to see?

Does anyone here like the sport of football?
I, personally, love football.

I love the lights and the pigskins and the... the shoulder pads.
Chrissy, Chrissy, Chrissy, do you really like football?
- Do you really like football?

What about the flea flicker?

The what?

- Yeah, the flea flicker.

- I cannot... what?

You know, the quarterback, he gets the ball... it's like a pass, then you give it to the running back...
- That way.

- No?

You and me get started.
This 14-time Pro Bowl selectee, shoo-in for the Hall of Fame, still holds three receiving records as a tight end.
Now he's scoring on a different level as he breaks down the game he loves on The NFL Today.
LSB, give it up for Tony Gonzalez!
Ho!
Here he go, here he go, here he go, here he go.
And this guy I'm about to bring out one of the most incredible defensive players to ever play in the NFL.
In his final game with the Baltimore Ravens, he walked away with the title of MVP and Super Bowl champion.
Tonight he comes to play on our field.
Make some noise for the motivational, the inspirational Ray Lewis!
Yeah!

- What's up, dude?

I feel like it's boy's night and ladies' night.
There it is.

So, Ray, you're gonna be up first.
- Tony, have a seat in the VIP.

Ray, come on.

All right, so what song did you choose to go at him with first?
I went old school.

- Okay.

- Oh, really?

- Are you serious?

Ladies and gentlemen, Ray Lewis!
Okay.

Chrissy, what you think about Ray's performance?
You know I love me a crooner, guys.
Woo!
That is some baby-making music and I would be lying if I said I have not done it to that many times.
- Yeah!

- I love that song.

She feels good.

Yo, Tony!

Al Green to come out of Ray?

You know he playing ga...

He... yeah, he's playing ga...

Whoa-ho!

I did not expect that.
This is the meanest man on the planet right now.
One of the baddest linebackers ever, and he's playing Al Green?
- That was me.

- I love it.

Tony, you step on up.
Hold up.
- Oh man.

We're back with Lip Sync Battle.
Tony and Ray kept it close going into halftime, but now it's round two, where it's all or nothing in their campaign for the LSB belt.
Before he takes the stage, let's see how Tony worked himself up for the win
- Woman:

- Tony!

- You ready for this?

Good job, guys.

They didn't tell me I was gonna be sweating on this.
Oh.
Tony:

Man:

No.

Super Bowl trophies and all that stuff.
What about me?

Woman on P.A.:

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Only here tonight, here tonight.
Hold on, lemme grab a drink.
We'll have fun tonight, no matter what.
Ah!
Woman on P.A.:

So, this is it, right?
I mean, I can't turn back now, can I?
I'm just as scared as I was when I go get them on the field.
That was the big deal, mind you.

Don't look at me, Nelly.

I have never asked this on this show, in my entire life, but, Nelly, can I get a hug?
- I love it!

- I love it!

- Chrissy:

You smell so good.
I'm...
I'm mortified.
So, Nelly, you feel like Ray did your song justice?
Man, he always does.

Oh, that's dope.
So, Ray, why did you choose Hot In Herre?
So, throughout my career, man, when I started coming out of the tunnel, if you ever seen my introduction dance...
Of course we've seen it.

- We've all seen it.

"It's getting hot in here."
- Oh!

And when 52 came out of that tunnel,
I needed to hear Nelly.
- You needed to hear it.

I love that.

All right, Ray, Nelly, you guys go on over to the VIP.
Thank you for being here.

The audience is gonna have a tough choice to make tonight.
When we come back, someone's adding that LSB belt to their trophy case.
It's Lip Sync Battle!

Welcome back to Lip Sync Battle!
Ray Lewis and Tony Gonzalez got it done tonight.
You guys faced each other on the football field, you know what I'm saying?

Well, I don't have to get hit by this... this nasty man.
He was a... he was a beast on the field.
One of the best linebackers ever.
And how's it differ for you, Ray?
I got so tired of chasing Tony Gonzalez.
You walk in a meeting, and the first thing coach says is, "We have to stop Tony Gonzalez."
That's amazing.

You dig?
- Chrissy.

All right.

Or is the champ Ray Lewis?
And the Lip Sync Battle champion is...
Ray Lewis.
- You won it tonight.

You won it tonight.

Bro, I had so much fun, man.
This is the most fun I've had in so long, man.
- I thank you guys.

And, Tony, how was your Lip Sync Battle experience?
I had a blast, and thank you to the crowd.
Thank you to Ray, thank you to you, Chrissy.
Thank you for having me out here.

A'ight, well, shout out to Ray and Tony for rocking with the Lip Sync crew tonight
Thanks to my homie, Nelly, for dropping by!
One love from me, LL Cool J, and my girl, Chrissy!
And remember, whatever you do in life, no matter what it going through, knock 'em out the box, L!
