Smeemo, mo, mo, mo?
Boosan, san, san, san?
Where's all the dirt?
Yeah.
And what are those ball?
The coffins of the future?
Is this whole place a fancy human graveyard?

What are you doing with that egg?
I don't know yet.
Hup, hup, hup!
Mmm.

BMO:

- Mama, dance.

- Shake.

Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh!
- I'm your mama.

Cluck cluck, peck.
- Scratch, scratch, baby.

Hatch into my heart, Yogurt
BMO, we found you!

[ Pops lips ]
Huh.

Both:

Choose your avatar!

Choose your avatar!
Oh, wow.

You look crazy.
[ Thud!

Yo, param-zero yah hit-box, system dumps!
- I corrupted all over the hood

His datamine.
- He targeted my booty disk.

- 0011010.

Rip, those Avies are older than my "A" drive.
[ Indistinct chatter ]
Get big phone.
Yeah, I'd like to request a mod, please.
Yeah, there's a couple of system-dumps in the pizza romance RPG mega-quadrant.
On server eight.
Yeah, WOLFPRUD3, with a 3.
Mm-hmm.
Yep.

Get cup!
Get cups!
Get peas.
Aw, yeah, here comes the mod.
Y'all are in trouble.
- BMO!

Ban!
[ All scream ]
Y'all want to see my dance club?
Yeah!

[ Dance music playing ]
- I love your skin, BMO!

Thank you.

Well, look who it is!
Welcome back to your palace, Your Majesty.
Hi, Vinny!
Who's Vinny?
I thought I was hereby known as "Get in Heeyah!"
I deserve that.

I've just been so zip-zopped-out over the bip-bops.
[ Beeping ]
What?

Who let these two system dumps into the chat room, know what I'm saying?

- Yes, I do, Vinny.

I'm gonna go deep dope my ping-pong zilp-zorch.
What?

[ Singsong voice ] What's the magic password?
Please, Vinny.
You got it, boss!
This super-skin costs 15 million crypto-coins.
Give it to me, Vinny.
[ Beep ]
I'm beautiful.
BMO?

Dang it, Vinny!

We still don't know where Susan is.
Have you seen her?
Oh.

But that's really easy to search for.
[ Whirring ]
The island chain brain frame has located her 32.7 miles east of here.
Well, this is great.

Come along, BMO.
No.
I think I need to stay here forever.
Ha!

[ Gasps ]
I'm gonna just go yank off his goggles.
[ Electricity crackles ]
[ Growls ] They thought of everything.
But who is "they"?

[ Wings fluttering ]
[ Computers whirring ]
Humans!
[ Laughs ] Get broadsword.
[ Imitating electric guitar ]
[ Slurps ]
[ Electronic music plays ]
So, you really don't want to come with us?
You sure you don't want me to milk you up a fresh new style?
No, I'm used to it now.
Why don't you want to come with us?
I mean, I do want to go with you.
But I am a beautiful, big man here.
All of my instincts are in sync with this computer world.
I'm really comfortable here.
Yeah, but it's all fake.
What's real?
Your eyeballs think the sky is blue, but that's just sun rays farting apart through the barf of our atmosphere.
The sky is black.
Oh, yeah!

[ Music tempo quickens ]
[ Crowd whooping ]
[ Music stops ]
Ha ha!

[ Sobbing ]
BMO's pretty upset with you.
Why'd you tell him it was me?
You want me to lie to him?
Yes!

Get magic staff!

- Get katana!

- You did this!

- Get big phone!

[ Humans groaning ]
Now we're the system dumps!
Yeesh!
Jake, you turned the whole thing off?

I saved the world!
We gotta turn it back on...

[ Sobbing ] What?
[ Sniffles ]
- Get battle axe!

- Get awl pike!

BMO?

Vinny?
Give me one of your patented super skins made out of blip bloop cheese or something.
I can do nothing for you in this reality, Vinny.
No!

Vinny!
Geez Louise!
You really flipped out in here.
Anyone got some sticky tape?
BMO?
I will save you, "A Better Reality."
[ Static crackles ]
Don't worry, BMO.
Daddy's gonna just kiss everything in here, and that will make it better.
[ Wings fluttering ]
Mwah, mwah, mwah!
Oh.
[ Loud whirring ]
Ha ha ha.

[ Laughs ]
Ah!

[ Laughter ]
- We're back!

Get baseball bat!
Get broadsword!
Get jet pack!
Get bikini babe!
Hey!

I kiss you.
They are giving you this other pod to take you safely to the next rad island.
I will be returning to my dance club.
BMO, I'm sorry I smashed up your world.
I smashed it up because I love you.
Please don't go.
Well, m-maybe I could visit.
Oh, Jake, hug me tighter!
Okay!
Of course I won't go!
I would miss you guys too much.
I tried to make a Finn and Jake in the goggles world, but they were scary.
I love you, too, BMO.
[ Grunts ] I can't fit!
Are you still carrying that egg?
Yeah, it feels good.
Get rid of it, man.
I can fit, I just need to...
[ Chirping ]
Ah!

Finn, did you see?

Get in the pod.
This party is so crazy!
