[♪♪]
[tapping] [woman] So, why don't you, uh, tell me about yourself?
[man chuckles nervously] [man] I don't, uh...

Um...

- [woman] No, I do, I do.

[man] You know, uh...

It's, uh, it's uh, it's sexy.
- [woman] Oh, you think so, huh?

You're easy to talk to.
So...
It's probably why you're so good at your job.
- [woman] Probably doesn't hurt.

[woman] What do you want to know?
[helicopter overhead] [siren wails] [man] I don't know, like, um, what are you wearing?
- Kevlar.

Yeah.
Shooter's in position, keep him on the line.
Haas, this guy wants to be talked out of it.

Negative, soon as I got a shot, we're taking it.
[Blair] Are you fucking crazy?
You start firing in there, people are gonna get killed.
Five minutes.
[radio static] Team one, what's your status?
Are you... are you there?

Yeah, Dan, I'm...

Hey, listen, I was thinking that, maybe we could... meet in person.
You mean, like a date?
Yeah, sure.
[voice breaking] Oh, who am I kidding?
[Dan] I didn't" I didn't mean for this to happen.
[stammering] I...

All I wanted... all I wanted was my goddamn tax refund!
[people whimpering]
Dan, please, hang in there for me, all right?
Please.
I don't...

My little boy, he deserves better than this.
[Haas] Team one, fire when ready.

Agent Blair!

[Haas] Go!
[people whimpering] [sniffles]
Hey, Dan?
Why don't you tell me where we're gonna go on that date.
Wait, what?
Oh... yeah, I mean, I know of a...

Yeah, it's a little place called Fa...

- Falimese's, Falini's?

[Dan] Oh, yeah, real-real good.

Well, maybe we should, um, go somewhere else then.
[♪♪]
[Dan] You know, it just occurred to me, I don't know what you look like.
I mean, how am I supposed to recognize you?
Trust me, I'm not gonna be easy... to miss.
[siren blares]
[Haas] Whose side are you on, Blair, huh?
You want to take a bullet for one of your piece of shit lover boy, lowlifes?
Is that gonna satisfy whatever fucked up, female instinct it is you're dealing with?
Fine, be my guest.
You'll be doing us both a favor.
But I'll be double dipped in shit if I'm gonna let you get somebody killed just because you can't follow a fucking order!
I swear to you, Agent Blair,
I swear on my life, I'm gonna bury you.
You're out of my unit, you're out of my city, you're out of my fucking time zone.
They're not even gonna find your body under all the paperwork I'm gonna bury it in.
Your phone sex days are over, you listening to me?
[airplane engine]
[Rick] Good evening, welcome aboard.
Good evening, welcome aboard.
Good evening, welcome aboard.

- Thank you.

Good evening, welcome aboard.
[advertisement on PA] Discover the world.
Speedbird Airways...

Delight in exclusive wines, paired expertly on board our new, luxury airliner
Speedbirds legendary service is discernible in every enriched detail... [coughing] [babies crying]
[people arguing indistinctly] [coughing] [sighs heavily]
Excuse me, thanks.
[indistinct chatter]
[baby continues crying] [quietly] Excuse me.
- This you?

[clicks tongue] Not meant to be, I guess.
Figures.

[chuckles] I hope not.
[dull thump]
Oh, my God, the snobs in first class are already wearing me out.
I'm Claire, by the way.
Um, I don't think we've flown together before, is this your first overnight to D.C.?
No.
All right, well, I'm gonna keep you back here for the whole preflight song and dance with Rick, and then I'm gonna need you to get on food and beverage service, right away.
Okay, thanks.
[baby wailing] [clears throat]
Excuse me.
[soft chuckle]
I think that's my seat.
[bums]
Oh, actually, um, it's the window seat?
Oh, well, I'm already buckled in here.
[clicks tongue] Okay.
[Mrs. Walsh] Oh, goodness.
Uh, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be a pain...
Forget it, it's not a big deal.
You're in my seat.
Look, lady, what's the difference?
If you don't want to sit here, you can just sit someplace else.
Listen, you fucker.

My ticket says seat 44A and you're in my seat.
So you can either move, or I'm gonna rip that stupid, fucking little cat shirt off of your body and shove it up your...
[Claire] Are we okay here?
This woman threatened me.
Sir, I'm...

Sorry, I have had along couple of days, and I don't mean to cause any problems, okay.
I...

Sir, could I get you a complementary beverage or some snacks, perhaps?
I'll take a complementary meal.
I'll be right back with that.
I'm gonna need for you to come with me, please.
And... and a seatbelt extender.
Oh, of course.
Sorry, again.
I... excuse me, I'm very sorry about that.

The way I handled that, normally I handle people much better,
I didn't mean to snap at him.
I think you'll be more comfortable here.
Are you serious?
Well, I can't have you offing my passengers in cattle class.
[exhales] I thought you were kicking me off the plane.
No.

- [Blair] Thank you.

Oh, and by the way, I've always wanted to do exactly what you just did back there.
- [Blair] Thank you so much.

Ah, folks, from the flight deck, this is your captain.
Got a few more minutes here before we push back from the gate.
So, everybody just go ahead and get yourselves comfortable, we'll have you in the air in no time.
We're looking at clear skies ahead.
Flight time should be about five and a half hours.
Welcome aboard.
- Is this your first time?

Flying business, I mean.
Do I look that out of place?
- On the contrary, I uh...

I think you're right where you belong.
[quietly] This is really cool.
Terry, Terry Lenix.
Blair, Gretchen Blair.
[chuckles] Can I get you a drink, Ms. Blair?
Uh, sure.
- Excuse me, may I have...

- [Claire] Would you like a towel?

Mm-hmm.

[man] Thank you.
Ma'am, would you like a towel?
So, what are you getting away from?
- Nothing.

- Nope. [clears throat]

I...

I just...

That's quite all right.

Okay, well, that's not quite what I meant by...
Okay, I fucked up and I have to fly to D.C.
and sit behind a desk for the rest of my life, so I'm in no real hurry to get there.
- So don't go.

Forget D.C., stay on the plane and come with me to Paris.
Oh, you weren't kidding about cutting the small talk, were you'?
Why not?
[scoffs] Because it's insane.

Anymore insane than doing something that you know won't make you happy?
Maybe up here in business class you can afford to make decisions like that, but back there I kinda have to follow the rules.
People only really follow the rules because they're too afraid to make decisions for themselves.
Well, I work in law enforcement, and they're kinda sticklers about rules.
Can I help you?
I was just wondering where you hide the gun.
All right, everybody, welcome to Speedbird Airlines, great to have you aboard.
If I could just have your attention for a second, we have an important message.
Make some noise!
[energetic music]
[Rick whoops] [baby crying]
Hey!

[man 1] Fuck you!
- Yeah, yeah!

[singing indistinct]
Yeah!
[whooping]
Yeah!

- Yeah!

[Rick singing along] ♪ The airline that's at home in the sky ♪

[Bong fades]
So, hostage negotiation,
- I never would have guessed.

I probably would have thought something more, like, meter maid.
- Screw you.

I'm actually really good at it.
So you must meet your fair share of unsavory characters.
- Yup, all the time.

- So, be honest now.

Do you ever root for them?
- For who?

- Uh, no.

No, never.
I mean, you're talking to them, you're building a rapport, you must have to sympathize for them on some level, right'?
I mean, there they are, these poor crooks, they're, uh... trapped in a bank or up on some ledge, the whole world against them.
Holding innocent people at gunpoint.
[chuckles] Yeah, yeah, all right, I'll give you that.
- But... [chuckles]

Thank you.
But, there must be some small part of you that every once in a while, deep down... you just want them to pull it off.
[scoffs]
I mean, everyone loves an underdog.
[♪♪]
[Blair] Seasoned potatoes...
Couldn't have been that easy.
Hm?
Uh, nothing.
- Maybe I should get...

Roasted Brussels sprouts sound good, and it also comes with the...
Sir...
I'm gonna need you to return to your seat.
[grunts]
Terry, I can't decide.

Now, do I get the strawberry cheesecake or the butterscotch pudding thing?
Are you okay?
I'm fine, thank you.
[engine whirring]
[mechanical whirring]
[indistinct radio communication] [captain] Control, Speedbird 709, 1,000, climbing, 6,000.
So I'm trying to make my descent and this girl climbs right in my lap.
- Pops off her top.

No, and Cockburn's right there in the jump seat.
He says "Want me to take her from here?"
So I... [chuckles]
I looked at him and I said, "The girl or the plane."
- [captain laughing]

[mutters] Assholes.
[♪♪]
[Blair] Need another drink?
Terry?
Do you want me to get you another drink?
I certainly wouldn't have guessed you to be a nervous flyer.
It's not the flying as much as the, uh... the feeling of surrendering control.
Do you want me to get the flight attendant for you?
No.

Well, don't worry.

It's got redundant systems, fly-by-wire controls, built like a tank... a tank that can fly.
How do you know all that?
The FBI uses this aircraft to train for rescue scenarios, and we train for everything.
- Stealth entry, containment, emergency...

- pay you well?

- I'm talking, 60, 70,000.

You know there is a fine line between being eccentric and being rude.
How would you like to be 50 million dollars richer by the time we got off this plane?
I'm sorry, my ears haven't popped yet.

I'll pay you 50 million dollars, right now, if you'll agree to help me.
[scoffs] That's what I thought you said.
And what is it that you need my help with, exactly?
Getting off this plane alive.
[♪♪]
[curtain track rattles] Keep that opened, please.
[metallic thud] [bones crunching]
[♪♪] [soft chuckle]
Ms. Blair, I'm trying to tell you that this plane is about to be hijacked.
The people behind it are not interested in terror, they're not interested in politics, all they are interested in is me.
What people?
One of them is the stewardess.
Flight attendant, we don't say stewardess.
- Flight attendant.

I mean, she's not actually a... a flight attendant.
She's um...
- She's... she's what?

[clears throat] Okay.
[flight attendant] Something to drink, sit'?
No, I'm fine.

Water, coffee, maybe...
No.

It's a long flight, sir.
I won't be coming back through the cabin for a while.
Okay, uh, I'll have a ginger ale.
[can pops Open]
[flight attendant] Here you go, sir.

Thank you.
Okay, now we don't have very much time.
Now, I realize the situation that I'm putting you in...
You really don't.
Do you understand that I can report you for making a threat against this aircraft?
Hey, I'm not the one making threats here.
- I'm the one they're after.

You need to stop this, or I'm gonna go find a flight attendant...
Gretchen, listen to me.
Now, I know these people.

Mm-hm, and what makes you worth so much trouble?
Believe me, I'm not.

You know what, I don't even want to hear this anymore.
When I get back, you're gonna shut the hell up, and I'll pretend like we didn't have this conversation, okay'?
- Gretchen.

You have to trust me.
[flight attendant] Miss, is this man bothering you?
No, I just think he's had a little too much to drink.
Excuse me.
Hmm, champagne.

[sighs] [water running]
Hello?
[flushing]
Hello, are you all right?
[muffled screaming]
- You miss me, baby?

Yeah, probably wouldn't.
I like what you've done with your hair.
[gasping groaning]
[Ferry wheezing] I said I liked it.
I'm gonna ask you nicely, Terry, once, for old times' sake.
Which old times are you remembering, exactly?
Where is it?
If this is about the old espresso machine,
I threw it out with the rest of your crap.
[groans] Yeah, that's a bit more like I remember it.
Tell me where.
I hate to be the one to break it to you, Sadie, but this plane will never be in the air for long enough for you to find it.
[man] Terry... the plane belongs to us now.
[♪♪]
[sighs] Nothing here.
Give me some credit, Sharpe.
Look at this, Valentino, Canali, Savile Row.
You're questioning my sense of style now, too?
Style's your problem, Terry, I mean, just can't help showing the whole world who you are.
How do you think we found you?
Lesson number one, if you're gonna double cross somebody, don't leave them alive to do anything about it.
You'd be the authority on that then.
Let's face it, Terry, you got greedy.
One man could never spend that much money on himself.
Congratulations, Sharpe, you caught me.
A lot of fucking good it does you sealed in a tube 35,000 feet in the air.
You're all out of moves.
This isn't a fucking getaway car shop.
Even if you get into that cockpit, if, the moment this plane goes off course they'll scramble half the Air Force to shoot us down.
Well, I agree with you.
But... first, they have to find us.
What the fuck is that for?
[beeping]
Well, hi, there, darlin'.
Sure you're old enough to be flying by yourself?
- What can I get for you boys?

Take a pop.
We haven't had you up this way before, have we?
I think you'd remember.
[captain] I'm sure I would.
Ow!

[grunts] [groaning]
[panting]
[Ferry groans]
What do you say, Terry?

She should have left well enough alone, Sharpe.
Well enough's got a way of changing, once you get your hands on a billion dollars.
[grunting, groaning] [breathing heavily] I left you with two legs to walk away with, Sharpe.
You shoulda used 'em.
Now I'm gonna have to take your advice and kill you.
Who you kidding, Terry, you're no killer.
But, you're one hell of a thief, I'll give you that.
You just never knew how to hold on to something once you had it.
[♪♪]
[panting]
- [beeping] - [businessman] Any minute now.
Really?

[pushes call button repeatedly]
Put my kids through college for what this seat costs,
I can't even get a goddamn water?
[sighs]
[businessman] Anyone.

I'll take the guy.
Really?
Get gold status, my ass.
Ow!
This doesn't have to be it for us, you know.
Save the charm for your first class skanks.
Mm, you do still care.
[scoffs]
Maybe I'm approaching this from the wrong angle.
I don't even know who she is.
I guess we'll find out.
[indistinct chatter]
[typing] [woman] The internet isn't working.
Excuse me?

[knocking]
Excuse me?
[thudding]
[gasps]
Oh, my God.
[disorienting ringing]
Hey.
Hey, it's you.
[man] I didn't get your name.
Gretchen Blair.

[chuckles] Okay, I'm Luke Byres...
- You're the air marshal.

H... how'd you know that?
I know, you need to watch how you carry your gun on the left side.
It's a dead giveaway.

I think the plane's being hijacked.
Luke... the plane's being hijacked.
Um...
Has a threat been made?
I don't know, but there's a dead flight attendant back there.
- This is your first security situation.

Okay...
Um, I need to secure the cabin.
- Secure the flight deck.

Some of the flight crew might be the hijackers.
- [Burly] Fucking bullshit, man.

[Burly] You never said nothing about any lame uniforms.
[Rawbones] Like it makes a difference to your Gene Simmons-looking ass.
[Burly] Fuck, this looks stupid.
[Sharpe] Control, this is 709.
Because of weather up here, request permission to descend to 28,000.
[air traffic controller] Roger, Speedbird 709.
Descend and maintain 28,000.
We gotta notify the captain, reroute the plane.
All right, I'll go with you.
[grunting]
- [passengers screaming] - [Mrs. Walsh] Oh, my!
[gasps]
[♪♪]
[passengers screaming]
[screaming continues]
[screaming continues] [woman] Please... [continues indistinct] [panting]
I thought Sharpe knew how to fly this fucking thing.
[Sadie] He knows what he's doing.
Which is what, exactly?
Ensuring our passengers' cooperation.
[♪♪]
[Sharpe] Folks, this is your captain up here in the flight deck.
Sorry for the bumpy ride back there, urn, we're experiencing a small drop in cabin pressure, nothing to worry about.
H' I could ask you to remain seated with your oxygen masks on, and I'll have the flight crew come back through and perform a spot check.
I don't think these guys are our flight attendants.
Somebody like to tell me what the hell is going on'?
[Burly] Just stay in your seat, sir.
- [businessman] What are you doing?

That's my bag!
[Burly] Get in your seat... before I put my fist up your ass.
- [woman screams]

[passenger 1] Hey look, look at that guy.

[passenger 2] What do you think he's looking for, a bomb?
- [passenger 1] A bomb?

[passenger 2] You think they'd tell us if there was one?
I think he's right.
They could be rigging the plane with explosives.
They're not rigging the plane with explosives, they aren't terrorists.
- I need to get to the flight deck.

Procedure says we secure the flight deck.
They already have the flight deck.
You need to listen to me very carefully, there is something on this plane that they want.
And we need to find it
- so that we can negotiate with them...

The guy that was sitting next to me in first class, offered me a lot of money to help him.
That's who we need to find, fast.
Can you handle the flight attendant?
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

I don't know.
[♪♪]
[panicked chatter] [screaming]
Son of a bitch.
[Burly] All right, everybody calm down.
This is a standard aerial procedure.

- [Luke] Air marshal!

[♪♪]
[grunting]
' [Grunts] " ow!
Terry?
I had no idea you felt that way about me.
Shut up.
We gotta move.
Gotcha.
- Your ex?

I take it things didn't end well with her'?
[Ferry] You have no idea.
Hello.
[grunting]
Terry... [groaning]
Sharpe.
[phone ringing]
Sadie, what the hell is going on back there?
Someone cut the power.
Jesus.

Don't be stupid.

I need you to talk me through how to get the fights back on.
[no audible dialogue]
[♪♪]
Where is he?
[scoffs] [man yelps]
[man] Hey, man, I'm done with this.

[Rawbones] Shut up.
- Hey.

He must have got by me.
It's a fucking plane, you idiot.
- Everybody sit down.

All right, he's got to be in here somewhere.
[sarcastically] ...

So go fucking find him.
You assholes had one job.
Everybody, masks off, now!
[Mrs. Walsh] Oh!


[gasps]
[♪♪]
[Sadie] Go.
- [Rawbones] You.

Hey, get off!
[bones cracking]
[Rawbones] You see the fucking light?
That's what happens when you don't stay seated.
Agent Blair.
[Blair] I oughta kick your ass.
I knew you wouldn't let me... down!
[metallic clang] [grunts]
Thought the deal was supposed to be you saving my ass.
We don't have a deal.
[groans]
[Ferry sighs] You know, if you wanted to organize some alone time, you coulda just asked.
So, uh, what's the plan?
Well, my clearance was downgraded so I had to check my service weapon.
So, we need to find my bag.
[Rawbones] Give me your hands... [zip tie cuffs tightening]
I want everyone on this goddamn plane accounted for.
[Rawbones] Hands out.
[♪♪]
[Rawbones] Let's see 'em.

Where's the man who was in this seat?
[Mrs. Walsh] I don't know.
[Sadie] Where the hell is he?
Where the hell is the man who was in this seat'?
Who knows, who saw him?
Where the hell is he?

[Blair] What, are your arms broken, or what?
- [Terry] Right.

So, what does this bag look like?
It's Fendi.
[Ferry] Maybe you don't need money as badly as I thought.
[Blair] It's a shitty knockoff.
[♪♪]
[phone ringing]
Matthew.
Well?
- [Sadie] Still no sign of him.

What the hell, Sadie?

It's a goddamn airplane.
[Sadie] Is this how you talk to me now?
[Sharpe] No, no, I'm sorry.
Good.
Now fly the fucking plane, I'm dealing with it.
Check under the seats, check the lavatories, check anywhere else on this goddamn plane that you can.
Find him.
What the hell?
- Move!

[metallic thud] [Rawbones] Fuck!
You've got to be fucking kidding me.
- What the hell happened to you?

You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
Do I gotta mark right here?
No, no you're fine.
- [Blair] Ow, dammit.

I just need a minute, hold on.
All right, you've hurt yourself.

Here.
So how's the business class experience working out for you?
[chuckling] Oh, it's been lovely, everything I imagined it would be.
Who are you?
- I'm sorry?

Who are you?

What is your involvement with this?
I was their partner.
- You worked together?

What kind of work?
I guess you could say freelancing was a polite euphemism.
Okay, so, you're criminals.
- I like the way I say it better.

You do realize that I'm gonna have to arrest you when this plane lands, right?
Okay, let's just worry about getting back on the ground, first, okay.
No.
Do you want me to list off all of the felonies that you've committed.
Hey, how many times do I have to tell you that I'm not the bad guy here.
Oh, wow, oh, my God.
I love that you actually, genuinely believe that.
But to be honest with you, you haven't told me a goddamn thing.
You know, it really was the perfect plan.
Clearly, Terry, this was a perfect fucking plan.
I was the confidence man.
You know, the guy in the suit.
Any room I walked into, I could tell you where the money was in five minutes flat.
[sighs] Sharpe...
I mean, the guy that looks like brute, his mind is like a steel trap.
Any machine you can think of, if they've built it, he can take it apart and put it back together with his bare hands.
Of course, when he uses those hands on people, he can have decidedly different results.
And as for my, uh...
- ex...

I guess you could call Sadie, the balls.
[Blair] The balls?
That's really nice.
Hey.
Get down there.
Lenix... bring back alive.
The woman?
Break her.
- [Get down!

[♪♪]
[bones crack] [man groans] [both speaking French]
[panting]
[Burly] Yoo-hoo.
[Rawbones] Anybody home?
[Burly] Man, you gotta stop doing that.
What?
Finishing my sentences.
People are gonna think we're married or some shit.
[breathing heavily] I don't think they saw us.
Oh, my God, I just saw my suitcase, it's right here.
Can you get to it?
Yeah, just keep watching.

Tell me if they come.
I got it.
- [groans] Oh, shit.

Mag.
Hold on.
Come on.
[Rawbones] Gotcha.
[grunts] [grunting]
[♪♪]
[gunshot]
You know, I don't impress too easily, but that's... that's pretty fucking cool.
Gretchen... what are you doing?
Show me.
- Show you what?

[♪♪]
Voila.
What the hell is this?
This... is the last place in the world that anyone would ever look.
What the hell is taking so long?
[gun cocks]
Don't move.
Stan walking.
What are you expecting to accomplish here, Mr. Air Marshal?
You're going to get me inside that cockpit.
You see, the thing about biological material is it's not subject to your usual X-ray screening procedures.
- Something about, uh...

Right.
Tell him to open the door.
- There's still a way out of this for you.

How much is he paying you anyway?
I fucking mean it.
You have no idea how long I spent on this score.
Some of the things I had to go through.
[clears throat]
How dirty my hands had to get.
[Blair] What the hell is this?
- How much?

Holy shit.
So you fucked over your partners, it's how this stuff goes down, right?
You really don't have a very high opinion of me, do you?
You know those guys up there?

They were the ones who stitched me up, they stabbed me in the back.
In the front, actually.
[zipper unzips]
What are you doing?
What, you want to carry a bucket of shit around with you as well?
[no audible dialogue]
Open the door.

[phone ringing]
[Sadie] Matthew... you know what to do.
[groans]
[passengers screaming]
[groans]
Hey!
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine, um...

- Hey, hey are you hurt?

I'm just...

[grunting]
- [Luke] Hey, Terry.

- [whispering] I'll be back.

You'll be safe here.
Terry, help, please don't leave.
Hey, Terry?
Terry?
Ewes?
Plane's secure.
It's safe to go upstairs.
I knew you were a good investment.
[gun cocks]
Sorry, Terry.
You're just not good at picking your partners.
[humming]
[orchestral music fades in]
[humming continues]
Where's your little traveling companion?
Your goons got to her before I could get to them.
Doesn't matter, she's dead down there either way.
[air traffic controller] 709, I have your altitude at 15, 000 and descending.
Do you wish to declare an emergency?
[thunder rumbles] Planning a reroute for you now, 709.
- Turn 38...

[air traffic controller] 709... 709, please come in.

- ls that?

[♪♪]
[Sadie] You're gonna wanna see this.
[rapid beeping]
[♪♪]
[passengers screaming]
[airplane rattling]
[breathing deeply]
That was almost as good as bad sex.
[chuckles]
[sighs]
- [woman crying]

[indistinct chatter]
Thank you, Lord.

[♪♪]
Folks, this is from the, uh, flight deck.
Sorry for the bumpy landing back there, we had to make an unscheduled pit stop.
So, I hope you're all okay.
We're having our mechanics perform a maintenance check, so just let those boys do their job and... we'll have you on your way in no time.
We are taking off in six minutes, no more no less.
[mechanic 1] Do it in five.
[passengers yelling] [mechanic 2] Shut the fuck up...

[mechanic 2] Shut the fuck up!
[mechanic 1] Do not give me a reason to kill you!
[hatch opens]
[mechanical whirring]
[drilling]
[grunts]
You're a bit of work, Sharpe.
[sighs, clears throat] What's that, Terry?
You coulda got away clean.

You know, best laid plans.
I spent seven years working on that plan.
- The plan was perfect.

Yeah, well, this is as far as you're gonna go.
There's no way outta this.
The people we stole that case from, never could've gone to the police.
They might as well have not existed.
But you just stole a plane with 200 people on board.
[scoffs] There's no way to hide that.
No way they won't come looking for you.
They won't be looking at all.
[mechanic 2 grunting] Come on.
Hurry UP-
We'd all be dead.
Hurry up!
I don't want to be on this fucking plane when it leaves.
[metallic sawing]
[Sharpe] When they're done sifting through the wreckage, everybody onboard will be accounted for.
[♪♪]
Sadie and myself included.
The black box, the flight recorder...
They'll figure out what happened on this plane.
See... [chuckles]
That's the beauty of it.
This plane is gonna be my star witness.
The mechanics are down there right now installing a dummy black box... that's gonna tell a very different story.
As far as the world knows, this plane just experienced hydraulic failure.
[mechanic 3] Come on, let's get it in there.
- How are we doing on time?

[Sadie on radio] Hurry up, we're taking off in two minutes with or without you.
Your cut's by the cabin door.

[mechanic 2] Let's gel off this fucking plane.
[mechanic 2] Hey, close the fucking hatch.
[mechanic 1] Ah, the hatch.
You know, I gotta hand it to you, Sharpe...
I thought I was the master criminal, but that is some serious... comic book, super villain shit.
Don't try flattering me.
[laughing]
[grunting] [neck snapping]
[mechanic 3] Clear.
- We all finished back there?

[seat belt buckles]
[Blair] Psst.
[clattering] [gasps]
[grunting]
[gunshots] [screaming]
Just go, go, get it off the ground!
[grunting] [screams]
Wow, you really do know how to handle people.
[Blair] Come on, I need your help.
- Just punch the fucking thing!

Go on, that flight attendants gonna help you down there.
She'll help you.
Okay, everyone, single file.

I need you to help me get people off of the plane safely.
Come on, let's go, single file.
[♪♪]
[Claire] Everyone, stay calm.
[explosion air hissing]
Are you fucking kidding me?
- [Claire grunts] - [businessman yelling]
Come on, go!

Here, give me your hand, let's go.
Come on!
Give me your hand.
Come on.
Come on!
You go first.
Go.
Come on.

[grunts]
[wind howling]
[grunting]
I can't let you go any further, agent.
- Luke!

What the hell are you doing?
Where are you going, to find Terry?
Put the gun down, Luke.
How much did he offer you, ten million?
You asshole!
Mega Yacht Monthly, huh?

Twenty million, huh?

- A little higher.

[straining]
[Blair yells] [metallic clang]
Luke, we're sworn to protect people!
Shut up!

I don't care about the money!
Yeah... well I do.

[yells]
[metallic clang]
Come on, you motherfucker, let's go!
[grunts] [kick impacts]
[groans]
[Sadie] How much time?
[Sharpe] Three minutes.
Rescue, this is control.

Level 3,000, heading 4-2-0.

[Sadie yelps]
Sadie!
[wind howling]
[grunting]
[Sadie] Sorry, sweetie... you don't belong up here.
You need to adjust your altitude, bitch.
[Sadie screaming] [wet thud]
[♪♪]
Terry!
I think we should be going!
We lost the other chute.
Any excuse, huh?
Shut up.
- Let's go.

Here, take this.
Got it.
Ready?
- Set.

[beeping] [automated alert indistinct]
[Sharpe] Oh, shit.
[sighs]
You never did give me an answer.
About what?
Here, let me take that.
[grunts]
- Um, watch your hand.

Answer about what?
About Paris.
Really?

[Ferry] I'd say we have time.
You know, it's probably weeks before they figure out we weren't on that plane, if they ever do.
So what do you say?
[Blair] Let's just worry about getting back on the ground first.
[♪♪]
