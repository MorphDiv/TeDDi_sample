I can win!
Against Reiner, I can win!
Hey...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Eren!
"The Hunters"
"Trost District"
Commander.
Wake up, Commander Pyxis.
You'll get sick if you fall asleep here.
I can't believe you drank all this.
You're not young anymore.
And I'd rather not spend my days changing your diapers.
Being cared for by a pretty lady sounds all right to me.
Patrols were sent out once the Titans were gone from the 1st and 2nd defensive lines, but any Titan sightings are few and far between.
Hmm...
If Hannes and the advance squad followed the wall without problem, they'll be returning any minute now.
"Krolva District" "Trost District" "Hannes' Advance Squad"
It would mean they met the unit from Krolva District and turned around halfway.
And they couldn't have encountered many Titans, if any.
If there was a hole in the wall, it would never work out like that.
Commander Pyxis.
Hmm?
I hear you've captured one of those troublesome mice.
Yes.
Unfortunately, we were one step behind.
Hmm...
But at least it will get those goons in the interior thinking.
Maybe they'll reconsider how important their stale beliefs and motives are to them.
Yes, it appears they have.
Look over there.
The Military Police have finally been forced into an area with Titans.
Can't believe we didn't see any Titans.
Was there really none at all?
I wonder if they're still alive...
If you're looking for another chance, there's plenty of expeditions outside the walls.
How about we join forces and face some Titans together?
Uh, well you know...
We're busy with work on the interior...
The advance squad's returned!
Inform Commander Pyxis!
I see...
So there was nothing wrong with the wall?
Yes, sir!
As I suspected...
H-However, there's a bit of a situation!
We were heading back to Trost to give our report when we ran into the Scout unit led by Section Commander Hange.
Along with them, there were recruits from the 104th without their equipment.
And it turns out, three of them were Titans!
What are you talking about?
U-Uh, well...
Jean, relax.
What happened when their forms were revealed?
The Scouts engaged the Colossal and Armored Titan in battle.
But by the time we joined up with them to fight it was all over.
Luckily we were above so we got away unscathed.
Everyone underneath got blasted by steam and wind.
There's nothing they could do.
How's Mikasa doing?
I don't see any bad wounds, so I'm guessing it's a concussion.
I see...
I'll get you something.
You've gotta eat.
"Information Available for Public Disclosure" "Field Rations"
Mikasa!
It's those three bullies again.
They took some bread I bought from me.
So he went on his own to get--
I tried to stop him!
Wait!
Give it back!
Got it?
That was three days' worth of food for his family!
If you're fine with vomit, I'll give it back.
Pay him back for what you took!
Hey!
You drunk, good-for-nothing soldiers!
Come and break up this fight!
Put a sock in it.
Can't you see the kids are just fooling around?
It'll be fine, I'm telling ya.
Someone will be along who can help more than we can.
Eren!
Eat this!
It's Mikasa!
Eren, if you don't get home and chop wood, your mother will get angry again.
You asked for it!
Eren!
Let Mikasa handle this!
Yeah, right!
Nice one, Eren!
Don't lose to Mikasa!
I told you to stop the fight, you damn freeloaders!
You son of a--!
Heh.
That was a pretty good punch for a chump who runs a stall.
--Cut it out!
Damn it!
Knock it off!
Wait right there!
Wait!
Thanks for trying!
Go home without me!
Eren!
Stop right there!
Eren!
Mikasa?
Mikasa, calm down!
You shouldn't be moving!
We don't know how badly you're injured!
Eren was taken away.
Ymir, too, by Bertholdt and Reiner.
Eren, he he lost to the Armored Titan.
It's been five hours since then.
Is anyone...
Is anyone chasing them?
No...
All the horses are on the other side of the wall.
In order to rescue Eren, we have to wait for lifts to come so we can move the horses.
There's nothing we can do.
Section Commander Hange and the other officers are too injured to move.
To even send out a small scouting party, we're going to need more soldiers than this.
Soldiers with experience.
Understand?
Not this again...
Does it hurt somewhere?
No...
I must've hit my head pretty hard, but I'm fine.
But...
When Eren was taken away by Annie I chased them right away.
And fighting alongside Captain Levi, in the end in the end, we were able to get him back.
But... if it's already been five hours...
Hey, Armin.
Why?
Why does Eren always go somewhere far away from us?
Yeah, now that you mention it...
Eren has always run off on his own, leaving us behind...
I guess that's just the way things are meant to happen... for Eren at least.
But all I want... is to be at his side.
That's all I ask for...
Armin, catch.
As usual, field rations are all there is.
Hmm...
Speaking of which, this is the same as always, too.
Ever since the good old days, you two have been there to clean up the mess of that brat.
It's a different time and a different place, but you kids are doing the same thing you always have.
Am I right?
The neighborhood bullies and Titans are a little bit different in size.
But no matter if he's up against three or five, he'll charge in all the same.
By the time Mikasa or soldiers showed up, he'd been beaten into a pulp every time.
But you know...
I've never seen him win a fight before, but I've never seen him get beat and give up either.
Sometimes he's so tenacious that even I think it's scary.
No matter how many times he's knocked over, he gets back up.
That's the kinda guy he is.
You think he'll get taken away without putting up a fight?
Even more so when he's up against just two.
He'll give 'em hell no matter who he's up against.
Until you or I show up to help.
That's how Eren's always been.
I loved those good old days.
If you ask Eren, he'd say those days were nothing more than a false peace.
But for me, I'm more than happy to be a drunk, useless soldier.
If it means getting back to those plain, ordinary days I'll do whatever I have to.
No matter how long it takes to get there.
I'm coming, too.
Without you three together again, I can't bring back the good old days.
They're here!
Hey!
Isn't that...?
Commander Erwin!
And the Military Police!
I never thought they'd ride along the wall.
That's probably the quickest route.
Christa...
I'd prefer if you stayed back, but...
No matter what you say, I won't.
I refuse to wait here when Ymir was taken away.
You two should know how I feel.
Christa has a point, Armin.
We have plenty of reasons for chasing after them.
One of which I still can't believe...
That Reiner and Bertholdt are our enemies.
I've gotta hear it straight from their mouths.
You made it, Commander Erwin!
Is the situation the same?
Yes, sir!
Good.
Deploy the lifts!
Moblit...
G-Gimme a map.
It might be a long shot, but there's a giant forest here.
We should head straight for it.
Though, it's not like they have a way to hide the Armored Titan's footsteps, but I think that's where they're headed.
Why's that?
It's a gamble, but even if they have the strength to change into Titans, the other Titans outside the wall might still be a threat.
Especially after all that fighting.
They might not be as bad off as Eren, but I'm sure they're exhausted.
Like how Annie was out cold for a while.
Let's assume for now that their destination is somewhere outside of Wall Maria.
Considering the distance they'll have to cover, we can assume they'll need to recover their stamina.
Which means... they'll want to rest somewhere where Titans are unable to reach them.
At least until nightfall when Titans can't move.
Oh, Eren...
You're awake?
We have until night!
If we reach the forest before nightfall, we still might make it in time!
Let's move!
Eren wakes up within the giant forest.
Desperate to escape,
Eren attempts to transform once again, but is stopped by Ymir.
Deep in the isolated forest, the emotions of Eren and Reiner violently clash.
They must settle things once and for all.
Not only for themselves, but for all those who've died.
