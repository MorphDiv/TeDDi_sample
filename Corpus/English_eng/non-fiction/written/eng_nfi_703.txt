Previously on "The 100"...
Part of A.L.I.E.'s code is still in my head.
Heightened mental ability, hallucinations, it's all connected.
- Raven.

Make no mistake... you choose to stay and you're choosing death.
Ok, then.

The only thing that's inevitable is Praimfaya.
In 6 days, anyone who is not in this bunker will be dead.
Fighting a war is a bad way to decide who gets to survive.
A conclave.
One champion per clan, and whoever wins gets the bunker.
You don't have to kill all 12 warriors.
I just have to kill the last one.
Octavia kom Skaikru is victorious.
Skaikru will not take the bunker alone.
We will share it.

What the hell did you do?
If only one clan can survive, it might as well be ours.
Clarke, you agreed to this?
We did what we had to do.
Skaikru have betrayed us all.
How could you do this?
There were only 4 warriors left.
Octavia was one of them.
She might have won.
And she might not have.
Bellamy, you're right.
She had a chance.
But Luna was in the final 4 as well, which means there is an even better chance of nobody getting into this bunker, of nobody surviving the end of the human race.
Can you understand that?
Yeah, I...

You did what you think you had to do, like always.
But you can't... you can't expect me to stay down here not knowing what happened to my sister.
We're not opening that door, son.
You know what?

I was setting up the infirmary, and I heard people in the corridor.
Is it over?
Did we win?
We don't know.
Where's Marcus?
He was in the tower.
We sent some people for him,
Bellamy, and Octavia.
Bellamy was the only one we could get in time.
I'm sorry.
Give me your radio.

The walkies are no good down here.
Clarke.
I'm letting them say good-bye.
I understand your need to know, but I promise you there is nothing but more pain on the other side of that radio.
The radiation levels have become critical, so people outside are already feeling the effects.
Once they realize that we took this bunker, it'll be chaos, and if we open that door, we let that chaos inside.
I understand.
Now, get the hell out of my way.
The walkies are set to 21.5 megahertz.
Can anyone...
Can anyone hear me?

This is Octavia.

O, it's me.

I'm alive.

Bell, what the hell did you do?
It wasn't me.

We don't have much time.
Listen to me.

A hundred from each clan.
Kane is out there buying us time, helping them select their people, and Gaia somehow convinced the scouts to lock down the temple.
But if anybody finds out that Skaikru stole the bunker, we're all dead.
Copy that.

Turn off the radio.
Thelonious, we can save them.
O, I'm gonna need some time.
Wait.

Bellamy, they don't have t...
Bellamy?
Did you hear her?
The Grounders are listening to her now, but they won't be for much longer.
I am opening that door.
I'm sorry, but right now, our people are safe.
We cannot risk that.
To stop me, you're gonna have to kill me.
Come on, Bellamy.
It doesn't have to be like this.
Whose crazy idea was it to turn an IVA suit into an EVA suit?
Yours.
I can't blame a figment of your imagination.
Reyes.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
IVA suits are designed for controlled temperatures, controlled environments, controlled pressures.
You know what has none of those?
- Space.

Not gonna be a long spacewalk if I have nothing to protect myself against solar radiation.
Think, Raven.

It's a science problem, like any other.
The last one you'll ever have to solve.
After this, there'll be no more pain, no more loss.
While your friends are stuck in a bunker, you'll be floating, wrapped up in stars.
Hell, you want to go to the Moon?
We can do that, too.
Don't listen to her.
Raven.

Yeah.

Ok, I can do this.
This wiring is insulated with PTFE.
Teflon coating.
Yes.

I can strip it and melt it down and use it as sealant for the joints.
Pliable and radiation-proof.
Why didn't I think of that?
Not again.
That's the third time today.
Get the seizure kit.
Jasper.
Masquerade ball?

You think this is a joke?
Radiation levels are almost in the red.
Why do you think everyone's getting sick?
No more drugs.
Harper, are you ok?
I'm fine.
You're not fine.

We need to leave for the bunker tonight or we won't make it.
I was only able to make 3 suits, but I can take 7 in the Rover.
Hey!

What now?
Riley.
Riley?
He's not breathing.

Riley!
Black rain strikes again.
No radiation burns.
It wasn't black rain.
He's overdosing on your damn jobi tea.
Let him go, Monty.
Move!
Come on, Riley.
Come on.

Ok.
Look at him.

He's at peace.
What's the matter with you?
Harper, is this what we saved him for?
This isn't happening.
This is what he wanted.
Would it be better if he melted from the inside when the death wave comes?
The death wave comes in two days.
You'll all be dead tomorrow.
I'm leaving tonight.
No pain.
No suffering.
If we get the dose right, we can all go out like this.
When?
While we still can.
Tonight.
Tonight.
Tonight.
We did the right thing, Clarke.
Yesterday, we were right.
Today, we have to live with being wrong.
We're back on the Ark.
Killing our own people so that... so that we can live.
Locking them up.
Bellamy's sister is out there.
He would do anything to open that door.
Do you think that's a risk we should take?
No, but unlike you,
I hate myself for it.
How we feel about ourselves is irrelevant, Abby.
We all have done things to save our people.
Unconscionable things.
We've put our people first.
That is how we live with ourselves.
Your mother is strong.
You are stronger.
It won't always be like this, Clarke.
You'll see.
Bellamy will go free as soon as the death wave passes, ok?
Ok.
Good.
In the meantime,
Bellamy has a lot of friends in the guard.
We need to put someone on his door that wants to survive more than be liked.
I think I know someone like that.
They're just gonna keep him locked up for 5 years?
Of course not.
Clarke, this is his sister we're talking about.
I think we both know he's never just gonna let that go.
Look, all I need to know from you is...
Don't worry about it.

No one's opening that hatch as long as I'm in here with Emori.
Need a selfish bastard, I'm your man.
No!
How's he doing?
Get me out of here!
How do you think he's doing?
We'll take it from here.
This'll go well.
You'll talk to him?
Yeah.
Let me out!
I'll relieve you in 6 hours.
All right.
Help me!
Bellamy, what the hell are you doing?
You're just hurting yourself.
Murphy.

Untie me.

I can't do that.
Look, I'm...

- You let me go!

Ok, I can't.

So stop doing this to yourself before I call medical and knock your ass out.
You haven't changed.
You only care about yourself.
You're wrong.
Look, this is only gonna be for a few days.
She'll be dead in a few days!
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Murphy!
Let me out!
Sinclair.
Becca, where is he?

She is not as smart as she thinks.
Sinclair.

What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I didn't die so you could kill yourself.
I'm not killing myself.

I'm dying.

The Raven Reyes I know doesn't quit.
She keeps fighting.
What's happening to my brain isn't something you can fight.
How do you know?

Before you junk this beautiful mind on a whim, what do you say we look under the hood first?
Kick the tires.
I'm guessing there's still a few good miles in there.
Ok.
I added a filter so that the inside air is breathable.
This one shows the air in hangar bay.
It'll spike with the death wave.
But everyone here will be dead by then anyway.
Oh, Monty.
It's already happening, Harper.
You're getting sick.
If you come with me tonight, you'll get better.
The bunker is safe.
Then you should go there.
Now while you still can.
I'm not leaving without you.
Well, I'm staying.

But I don't want to watch you die.
You and Jasper are my family.
You're all I have left.
We can face anything together.
You're a fighter.

That's why I love you.
But I don't love you.
- Harper...

Do I have to spell it out for you?
You're not enough to make me want to live, and I am not worth dying for.
Save yourself.
Let the rest of us go.
They've made their choice, Octavia.
We have to find another way in.
There is no other way.
This one stayed hidden for 100 years.
Then we should break it open.
Then it won't protect anyone.
Bellamy will find a way.
The black rain is keeping the clans at bay for now.
But when it stops and they find out what your people did...
They stole the bunker.
They're not my people anymore.
I wondered why Kane was stalling.
Indra, no.
Skaikru dishonors us all yet again.
When the people find out, you'll pay for this in blood.
Skaikru wasn't the only clan that showed dishonor at the Conclave.
Was it?
I know you were disguised as a warrior on the battlefield, and I know Roan caught you.
I even know that he banished you for it.
Is this true?
If the scouts check the Blue Cliff warrior's body, they'll find Azgeda arrows.
And Roan did not have a bow.
Azgeda broke the rules.
They should not have a place in this bunker.
Wonkru, Indra.
I will not banish an entire clan because of one person's sins.
What do you want?
Only for you to honor your king by joining me.
If you do, when Bellamy opens that door, my decision will stand.
Azgeda will survive Praimfaya.
Your plan is to wait?
To hope Bellamy comes to your rescue?
Yes.
Knowing how he feels about you...
I'd say that's a good plan.
Using an electromagnetic pulse to get A.L.I.E. out of my head was like shutting down a computer by pulling the plug.
Part of the code is still in your head.
Exactly, which is why I'm Super Raven and about to be super dead.
Unless we can purge the code, stop the damage from getting worse, give your brain time to repair itself.
How would you do it to a computer?
Purge the residual code?
Simple.

The human brain is not a computer.
No kidding.
That's why your code is killing her.
Now, listen to me.

15 minutes.

Not if I was frozen.
Well, not frozen.
Just really damn cold.
Raven, the suit is almost ready.
It's T-minus now and counting.
Let's go for a walk in the stars.
She's not going to space to die.
She's going in the bunker to live.
Even if this idea doesn't kill you, you will just be normal again.
She was never normal.
Maybe not, but with me in her brain, she's da Vinci,
Einstein, Mozart.
And I choose Raven Reyes over those 3 hacks any day and twice on Sunday.
Enough.

Even if you live, the pain will still be with you.
I don't choose pain.
I choose life.
Let's get to work.
John?
John.
I wasn't asleep.
I'm here to treat Bellamy's wounds.
Try not to kill this one.
I'm here if you need me.
It's about time.
I didn't do this to my wrists for fun.
You want me to help you open the door.
Abby, I saw your face when you heard my sister's voice on the radio.
Kane's out there.
You don't think I know that?
Do better today than we did yesterday.
That's what he told me.
That's how we deserve to survive.
John?

Come quick.
John, get in here.
He'll be fine.
He's not our problem.
The airlock control is in the main office.
So is Jaha.
You have a plan for that, too?
Yeah.
Open the damn door or die trying.
So many empty beds to choose from.
I guess we weren't all your people after all.
- Niylah...

If I open the door... and everyone in this bunker dies... who will run the hydroponic farm or the air scrubbers or the water recycler?
No one.
This isn't about saving my people.
It's about saving the human race.
No.

It's time to face the music.
Yes?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Of course.

I think we should open the door.
This is about Kane.
No.

Survivors.

You've made decisions like this before.
This is the exact predicament you faced with Jake.
Why is this any different?
We were on the Ark.
We thought we were saving the human race.
But now what...
Now we actually are.
Those people outside will kill us if we open that door.
All of us, starting with Clarke.
Are you really willing to let your daughter die?
I am sorry for your loss, Abby.
Marcus was a good man.
He still is.
Abby, I promise you,
Octavia won't let anything happen to Clarke, and neither will I.
Let's do this.
It takes two people to open the doors... one from above and one from here.
Get into position.

Murphy?
The door.
Come on, Abby.

Bellamy, stop.
We don't have time for this.
The radiation is getting worse, and people are dying up there.
Clarke, what are you doing?
What I have to, like always.
Now, get away from the door.
No.

We knew what we were stopping then.
Now we know nothing.
We know that if that door stays shut, the human race survives.
Please.
You're gonna have to make it a kill shot.
It's the only way you're gonna stop me.
Oh, I knew you'd come through.
I love you so much.
Octavia, they're here.
Everyone except you.
We had a deal.

I said your people would live.
I didn't say anything about you.
You can tell them we stole the bunker if you want, but the door's open now, so...
Be thankful knowing your banishment will be short.
Praimfaya awaits.
The water's cold enough.
Your pulse is already dangerously slow.
Tell me again how you're gonna drop the electrical current to restart your heart once it stops.
A live wire on a timer set to go off 15 minutes after I flatline.
I rigged it to deliver the exact same charge as the defibrillator in the emergency med kit in the rocket.
Analog.

Heh heh.
I don't.
Why not rig a toaster to drop in the water?
It's grotesque.
A waste of your talent, Raven.
You know what else is a waste of my talent?

The murmur's still with us.
Shocking your heart could put you into cardiac arrest.
If that happens, you'll need to shock it again with the defibrillator.
Relax, Chief.

One last thing.
Everyone has a life instinct.
You'll panic;

How do you overcome that?
By being awesome.
I'm serious.
I know.

Here's the takeaway.
You don't have to be willing to die to really live.
I am.
If this works, you'll wake up, and we'll both be gone.
You're always with me.
Thank you.
You did this, Reyes, not me, not her.
It was in you all along.
It is not too late to change your mind.
There you are.
I've been looking everywhere.
You shouldn't be here, Monty.
None of us should be here.
You know why that moon's red?
It's really red?
I thought I was tripping already.
It's from the death wave.
Radioactive ash in the air.
If we leave now,
I can make two trips to Polis before it gets here.
That should be enough for everyone who wants...
I am leaving now.
For all its faults...
Earth is really beautiful.
How much jobi tea did you drink?
Just the right amount.
What did you do?
You weren't supposed to find out like this, Monty.
Find out what?
What did you do?
- Answer me!

Don't take that off.

Don't take that off.
No.

No.

- Yeah.

Get off or I will never forgive you.

Just come on!
Don't say that.

No.

Don't do this to me.

Say you love me or you'll regret it, Monty.
This is unsanitary.
Open your mouth.
No!
I'm just trying to help you!
This isn't a joke.

Let me help you.
This is you.
If you feel it, then say it.
No.
No.

Hey.

Jasper...
I love you.
I love you.
Jasper.

Jasper.
Oh, no.

Jasper.
No.
Let us go.
Oh, God.
Harper!
Harper...
No.

Monty.
I love you.
Can't die.

This is Raven Reyes... and I'm alive.
This facility won't run itself.
We'll need to prioritize doctors and engineers.
All right.

You call this justice?
I call this making things right, thanks to my brother.
You let this happen.
How many of us have to die?
You're lucky it's not all of you.
Lucky?
We have 100 spots.
The other clans have all... have all chosen their survivors.
We have to do the same.
100.
We have over 4 times that.
A pain that all clans feel.
Is this what you wanted?
No one wanted this.
Want's got nothing to do with this.
Skaikru gets 100 beds, same as everybody else.
Bellamy gets one of them.
The rest is up to you.
The death wave comes in 24 hours.
You've got 12 to decide.
