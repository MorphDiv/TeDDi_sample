Flight crew.
Have we been cleared for landing?
Carry on.
We should be arriving in althurbar soon.
What's our eta?
Uh, eta?
It's a trachlonian transpacial cruiser.
Far out!
Making miniature confederation ships again, huh?
Um, well, yes, sir.
Let me see.
We've almost got the whole collection now.
Your excellencies, we have been cleared for landing.
Well done, admiral.
What's happening?
What in the universe are those little annoying green second-class aliens doing around althurbar during this celebration?
Don't tell me someone invited the invas.
Captain, I can't be sure, but I think they said, "cleared to land."
Let's bring her in.
You must be pulling my legs.
What in the name of all the seven intergalactic divas is this about?
Hmm!
Tell me, sweeties.
Shouldn't you be away on this long super-far and oh, so important mission?
Well, we finished a little ahead of schedule.
But you didn't have to, you know, make such a big fuss for us.
Pardon me.
I always cry in 100 cycles of peace celebrations.
Hello.
What do you mean it's not working, darling?
It should've been ready yesterday.
I'm coming up there in 3.5 seconds.
These underpaid martians don't know the difference between a state celebration and a tailgate barbeque.
And you, little jelly-bugs, are coming with me.
If I let you invas in for just a second, this celebration is doomed.
Don't touch them.
They're relics.
These are the only remaining robots from the great war.
It was on special request of governor hur that we set them up here for all to see.
Frankly, my dear, why do you care at all?
Of course they don't.
They're de-energized.
Which means it's basically for decoration.
Sir, the fireworks are ready, but there seems to be a little glitch with the remote control.
My gosh, this is so beneath my pay grade.
Do I look like an electrician?
Hmm...
Then whose little alien finger will push the button?
But, sir, it could be dangerous to be next to the cannons when the fireworks go off.
Dangerous?
It'll be dangerous for you if by the end of the governor's speech
I don't see that tiny little sky in there all puffing and sparkling.
Ah!
Hey, a little early for all this, huh?
Catastrophe.
That's all you invas are capable of.
Incorrigible peasants.
The interplanetary leaders will be here for the celebration.
We can't put them at risk.
But, your excellencies, we want to stay for the party.
These seven lame brain-munchkins need to be out of the planet capital before they mess up the entire celebration.
But, sir...
You must understand, this celebration is not...
You are a menace!
It's not an event you'll appreciate...
The intergalactic confederation doesn't need invas...
Sorry, but we need to ask you to...
Get out!
Uh...
Get lost.
If you don't mind.
Sorry, about this.
Talk about overreacting.
I put on my best uniform for nothing.
What do they think we could've done wrong?
Congratulations, everyone.
All of you have done an excellent job.
I'm sure the science jury is going to take one look, and agree with me that you deserve the first prize.
Come, let's go.
We better get moving now if we want to reach the space observatory in time.
Gregory!
Gregorio!
Gregorio!
Have you seen my brother?
Fortunately, no.
Hmm.
Gregorio, they're gonna head out without us.
Big deal.
What's so hot about going to a space observatory without taking our telescope?
Observatories usually don't have telescopes.
Duh.
Ha!
We missed our chance.
Now we'll never get there in time.
Your move, mitsue.
Launch the spirit of zanza, come on!
I'm trying, but this crazy thing don't wanna...
Where are you?
Hey?
Our last test with this machine was a total flop.
Yeah, that was before I tweaked it a bit.
Where does it come from?
I took it from tank's bike.
He's so out of it, he left that piece of junk in my garage and never came back for it.
Whoa!
Gregory!
Gregory!
Did you hear that?
Gregory, are you nuts?
Give me back my bike seat, man.
Gregory!
Gregory!
Hasta la vista, tanque.
Get out.
You, like, got a photo with the Justin brothers?
Nobody gets close to them.
Hot!
That's why I left in my camera.
If I'd posted it online, you would have said it was Photoshop.
Mary Anne, are you nuts?
Taking this camera on the trip?
You might just lose that pic.
Gregorio!
Ah!
Whoa!
Yeah, right there on Wikipedia.
Oh, come on, banana.
The alien from roswell?
But they're close and always watching us.
Let's go, we'll miss the bus.
Agent mulder here can take his own flying saucer.
You just wait!
Ah!
One day... one day I'm gonna show you that they are among us and they are light-years smarter than you goat-heads.
I bet you didn't know they trim their bangs every two weeks.
Give me back my camera!
Gregorio, you are very late!
No!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa.
Huh?
That's mine!
Hmm.
Relax, we still can fix it.
There's just no way.
You're all a menace to this school.
But, Ms. clarisse, this was an accident.
Spilling coffee on my blouse was an accident.
Tripping off the stairs, an accident.
But this, this...
This is a disaster!
A hecatomb, a tragedy!
But we were crazy about going to the observatory.
It ain't fair.
Not fair?
Your little space game trashed the work of the entire school.
Ruined.
I'll tell you what's fair.
But, principal, I've been waiting for this trip since the beginning of the year.
You don't understand!
The jury will be coming back in two days to judge our school's entry, which is now destroyed.
It's all his fault.
Who cares whose fault it was?
What's fair is that none of you are going to the observatory.
You'll all stay behind to rebuild that model.
My mom's gonna kill me.
And I'm gonna kill this moron!
You have until Monday, or...
Just because of this dehydrated old tapeworm.
Or all of you will be expelled from the school.
Two days, that's all the time you have to rebuild the model.
The prize is in your hands now.
At least we'll spend the weekend looking at some planets, too.
Ugh.
Awesome, the whole weekend painting little styrofoam balls.
I never wanted to go on this lame field trip.
And now I gotta do extra homework?
Chill out, dudes.
Let's do it quickly and it'll soon be over.
Far-out, we're gonna spend the weekend together.
Great, bunch of freaks.
Seeing you all here at the capital again makes me very happy.
I can see you're all thrilled to be here.
We haven't been together like this since that movie premiere.
That one with the little guy with the stretching neck and the glowing finger.
The confederation has maintained universal balance and Harmony for 100 universal cycles.
Psst!
Each day we need smaller armies and fewer weapons.
Juice.
Let me try the jalla juice.
There is no try.
We can dedicate more resources to knowledge and preservation.
He's back!
Don't move.
Behind you.
All of you, freeze.
You're always babbling on about the same thing.
What you call balance is nothing but stagnation.
Change is what this universe needs.
Huh?
If you haven't noticed, you are all my prisoners now.
I need phone home.
Mennis, your time is over.
Bow to your new leader.
Me, gana gobler.
All interplanetary leaders are in althurbar, gobler.
Perfect.
Your excellency, a small craft was seen leaving the planet in sector delta.
Oh, that's nothing, gobler, just a few useless invas that we expelled from the ceremonies.
But I said, "no one leaves."
They're insignificant.
No one!
Destroy them!
Captain, we're ready for the optic-stellar jump.
What's our destination?
Take us home, invaxia.
No, no, no.
I don't wanna be explaining why we didn't stay on althurbar.
Huh?
What the...
We're being attacked.
What'd we do this time?
Being kicked out wasn't enough?
We've been hit in the fuel pipe.
Why'd this have to happen on my turn?
What should we do, captain?
Give up, wave the white flag.
I don't think they like it.
Press the panic button.
But we don't have a panic button.
Vanished?
Must have been vaporized in the attack.
Ha!
Sorry, I can't control myself with all these toys.
And where were you going?
I was going to take my place.
Well, there's no more, "your place."
I don't share power.
But, gobler...
Your highness.
Your highness, we had an agreement.
Invas spacecraft eliminated, sir.
Hmm, invas...
It's impressive, folks, he avoids one, then two, but then splat.
Not able to avoid crashing into an asteroid.
Could someone please turn off little El michels here?
Ah, Gregory, stop your ragging, huh?
Give me the joystick.
You guys said it was your last turn.
Now it is.
The dude's a loser.
Huh?
Whoa!
Are you guys deaf?
That was not the video game.
Huh?
I swear it wasn't me.
Awesome.
What is it?
Looks like something from an amusement park.
Yeah, from the last century.
Judging from the smoke coming out.
You think somebody's inside?
I knew this was gonna happen.
A flying saucer?
Okay, and I'm the lead singer from iron medal.
O-m-g, what is this?
Don't touch them, they might be radioactive.
Ahh!
They're green!
I am out of here!
I knew there was intelligent life out there.
Intelligent, huh?
That button you just pressed, what's it do?
It's our automatic language translator.
It helps anyone we meet understand everything we say.
I can totally not flop on my Spanish test.
We were attacked and crash-landed on your planet.
We were lucky that we didn't disintegrate.
And other aliens, the ones that attacked you?
What'd they look like?
Do they tentacles inside their mouths?
Or, I don't know, a little drooling mouth inside their mouths that comes out when they're mad, and blood like acid?
Or did they hunt you with tiny laser-sights and then collect your skulls?
Uh...
We don't have the slightest idea.
Get a load of these computers!
What does this do?
My seven inva captains, we need your help.
The confederation celebration was a trap.
We are being attacked.
And the interplanetary leaders are prisoners here on althurbar.
Find king mnemus on planet coloccus, and tell him what has happened.
Help us, seven invas.
You are our only hope.
The whole universe needs our help, and we're stuck on this primitive planet.
Hold on, little creature.
We do have technology here.
Maybe we can even get your saucer flying again.
We're really good at building things out of junk.
I mean, not that your spaceship's junk.
Get real!
Instead of making planets, we're gonna become, like, space mechanics.
Wow!
You make planets?
Yeah, but stuck here, we can't print anything else.
Looks like we have a really good reason to help you guys out.
Mmm.
And there goes Mary Anne basbaum, adding seven more weirdos to her b-f-f club.
This is the flight stabilizer.
It spins in the opposite direction to balance the movements.
I think I know what'll work as a substitute.
But even if we replace all the pieces, what do we do for fuel?
You sure you can't use gasoline?
No.
No one uses those smelly fossil fuels anymore.
Our engine runs on a blend of liquid and gas.
We use carbon dioxide mixed with a little sodium chlorite and phosphoric acid.
Impressive.
A fuel that's a liquid and a gas at the same time.
That is high-tech!
And that's not all.
This is the best part.
Our liquid-gas doesn't do anything until it comes into contact with this catalyzer pill.
Ooh, mint candy.
It'll be pretty hard finding something like that here on earth.
Can I take a look?
You won't believe this.
You bet, my little green friend.
Your fuel is gasacola mixed with mint candy.
Too much sugar will give you a headache.

hmph!
Excellent, who wants to serve the universe?
If you like, on the way, we can also print some planets.
Yippy!
A little girl like you doesn't belong where we're going.
Mitsue, you stay here with Phoebe while we're gone, okay?
Yeah, right.
Don't look at me.
Do I look like a babysitter to you?
Besides, you don't even know what the solar system is.
It's a group of planets that orbit the sun.
Now, can I go?
Okay.
But you gotta promise to listen to me.
I promise, I promise, I promise.
If that's all settled, then let's get out of here!
Activating boosters.
The gadgetgang in outer space!
Is something wrong, hur?
Your face is looking uglier than usual.
The saucer you mentioned wasn't completely destroyed.
What?
We detected their signal close to planet coloccus.
I've already sent two predator ships to finish the job.
There's nothing to worry about.
The invas are an inferior race.
You're as brainless as your old friend.
Everything is under control.
We are talking about invas, gobler.
You never were good at history.
Of course, you wouldn't know about an ancient legend that says invas descended from a great unknown power.
Prepare my ship, I'll take charge.
Put on the translators, or else you won't understand what these life forms are saying.
Incredible.
I can't believe you brought along extra clothes.
New places, new looks.
Like it?
Hot.
I mean, it might be hot out there.
Are the translators activated?
Um, maybe not.
Sort of, like, last year's look.
Maybe if the sleeves, uh...
Si fuesen un poquito más largas lo podria...
You put it on automatic.
A little lower on the hips.
It'll go great with knee-high patent leather boots.
I don't think it works with it-girls.
I still don't understand what she's saying.
It might not be a good idea for you to come with us.
We never know what we'll encounter.
That's exactly why you little guys might need our help.
Let's see if there's any cool spots around here.
You guys sure this is the way to king mnemus?
How should we know?
We've never been to coloccus before.
Are you kidding?
You've got us walking around on a strange planet not even knowing where we're going?
An old invas scout rule, when you don't know how to find someone, keep going until they find you.
Doesn't look like anyone is coming to meet us.
I think I prefer not being found.
They're gone.
Mmm.
Those things must've been running away from something.
Holy shoot.
It's El chupacabra!
I don't believe it, a chupacabra!
In here!
I don't think chupacabras are very smart...
They may not be smart, but they're good sniffers.
Oh, I guess I need a shower.
You did it!
Chupacabras don't like perfume.
That was close.
It couldn't end like this.
No, it couldn't.
That was my last bottle!
What the heck did you foreigners do to my dog, digger?
Now, how am I gonna find where that treasure is buried without my bloodhound?
That was a dog?
Boy, I was so close!
But when you airheads sprayed that stuff on digger, he lost the scent.
We're on a special mission to find the king.
Do you know where we can find him?
Are you kin to the king?
I hope he don't come 'round this neck of the woods.
We warned you once.
No trespassing here.
Uh, we was just passing through, partner.
I will take you to the king.
Yes!
You want some?
Ugh!
Your move.
Eat them up.
I didn't mean that.
Yuck!
You guys eat plastic?
Gross!
Goddarn it!
Always some earthling messing up my day.
Hey, I know you.
I think you're...
Awesome!
I knew I'd seen this guy before.
Dudes, I'm telling you, the truth's out there.
Wow, get a load of that view!
I knew this was gonna happen.
Sir, I found these intergalactic intruders in the prohibited territory.
Visitors to coloccus?
How did you find our planet?
Found it here, in my hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.
Hey, we're not with this, this Indiana Jones from space!
We're here for something else.
We're looking for king mnemus.
What did he say?
I think mnemus is, like, a bad word in their language.
I hope is one of those not-so-bad, bad words.
Silence!
Who are you?
We're inva captains.
Our ambassadress ordered us to find the great king mnemus.
But why would the inva ambassadress send you to coloccus?
That's a long story.
The confederation was being attacked, and all the interplanetary leaders were there.
Prisoners in the planet's capital.
Huh?
Inva?
Yes.
I, too, am a descendant of the inva.
But, how is it you came to live here?
The invas were a powerful people.
A great inva scientist developed a weapon that provided invas with an unimaginable power.
By any chance, did it happen to be a ring?
Our leaders became greedy.
Power changes people.
Even for a gentle people like us.
What a voice!
The struggle to control that all-powerful weapon cost many lives and much suffering.
The scientist left invaxia with his family, taking along with him the weapon he created.
That long forgotten scientist was my ancestor, invocalus mnemus.
He brought his family to this dry and hostile planet in an effort to restart his life.
The federation has long forgotten the planet coloccus.
There is no technology here.
That's why, my young ones, you won't find any help here.
You can't ignore this!
The universe is depending on us!
That's not our problem.
I shall not involve coloccus in a new war.
We came to this planet to remain far and forever from that.
He's just a little selfish, huh?
Enough!
We're going to take you back to your ship.
It's a ufo abducting another ufo!
Awesome!
No!
Phoebe!
We need to go after them!
You must help us!
I hope I won't regret this.
Where are the other invas?
Phoebe, chill out!
These robot dudes aren't Mr. nice guys.
But they're not yet elevated enough to speak with me.
These objects have remained unseen by many generation.
This map shows where the pieces are hidden, and this is the key that opens the temple.
You picked a fine time to play treasure hunt.
Did you say, "treasure"?
According to the legend, this map leads to the location of the lethal weapon that could destroy all other armies.
It's just a bunch of guns?
What do you mean, "just"?
That's exactly what we need right now!
The contents of the temple have never been revealed.
According to the map, the temple is at the south pole of the planet incos.
This could only be a legend, but I think you have no other choice.
There's just one little problem.
We don't have a spaceship, remember?
What a nice guy.
Hey, digger!
Is this your ship?
You're more brave than I thought.
Phew.
I couldn't keep doing that voice much longer.
Somebody gonna point me in the right direction?
Let me see.
In 300 miles, turn left, then proceed for 4,000 miles.
At the roundabout on the second moon, take the third exit.
Huh?
Phew.
What kind of space junk is that?
I like this one.
Listen, you are going to have a big problem if you don't start talking about what you were doing on that deserted planet.
Your highness, a transport has been sighted leaving the planet where we found the prisoners.
Hmm.
I knew my brother would find a way to rescue us.
Rescue you?
And who is going to save them?
Change course.
Let's find out who's really behind all this.
It's gotta be that one over there!
Everyone sit up, put on your safety belts.
Whoa... huh?
A little closer...
Now!
We lost an engine!
Hold on!
You know how to fly this thing?
That's the way to go!
Where'd you learn to fly?
Playstando!
My mom always said that video games were useless.
I don't know what's worst...
Being hit, or watching this.
That guy's got one of them back-end Cannon things!
Can you guys land this ship?
With one engine it's gonna be hard!
You can do it, Greg!
Keep them on the radar.
I think they forgot about us.
We gotta get out of here,
I need to scratch my nose!
Nice job, tank!
Oh, gross, tank!
Collision imminent.
Hold on for dear life!
I think we stopped.
Yes!
Our center of gravity has been disrupted.
Guys, don't move!
Bring them in.
Sir, their spacecraft is unstable.
If we use the tractor ray we can bring them down.
All soldiers to the attack!
Stop moving around, banana.
Wasn't me, I'm not even breathing.
That felt more like a...
Oh... but...
Where's that caterpillar now?
You gotta be kidding.
We don't understand anything about this.
Hey, a computer is a computer.
And anyone who can get around my dad's computer can get around any computer.
Looks like it's stuck in a force field.
They're coming, dude!
I think we better listen to them.
Oh, no!
We can't let the inva treasure fall into the wrong hands.
Just leave them tin cans to me!
How do we close it down?
Strike!
Huh?
Are you all right?
I suppose we've lost them.
Zombie robots!
Come on!
Good, Gregory!
Dude, I'm banana.
Cease fire.
Why did you hit me with that stupid stone?
Oh, my bad!
Look, I can see them!
What?
Wrong direction.
Ha, ha.
Got ourselves another new friend, eh?
Looks like I'm pretty good at attracting weirdos.
Reckon there ain't nobody weird here.
You talk funny!
Where's the map?
Got it here in my backpack.
We need to reach this tower, here.
You still don't get it, do you?
Their escape was part of the plan.
Was it?
Over here, you guys!
We've got to turn that key.
According to the map, we can't rub up against the sides of this cave.
Otherwise...
Otherwise, what?
It doesn't say.
No way!
My arm is not that thick, I think I can do it.
Think?
High four!
Huh?
What?
I guess the key goes here.
I will get it.
Hmm...
Maybe it needs a battery.
Strange... it's missing a piece, isn't it?
Is this what you're looking for?
I'm just as anxious as you to discover this mysterious inva technology.
Whoa...
Put down your weapons, or this is gone!
Yes!
Now step back!
Enough, kid.
Your show is over.
Let my brother go!
Look here, you worm in a bottle!
You wouldn't.
Are you hurt, Greg?
Put it down, kid.
Now, if you stay quiet, I'll let you live.
If this passage has been violated bringing you to this forgotten vault, then it means that my successors know that the time has come.
My research may be used to defend the ideals that I've always believed in, but you must use what's herein with wisdom.
Why did I waste my time chasing after something that belongs to these useless goofs?
Space junk.
That's your treasure.
That's not fair.
This is the essence of the inva people.
A revolting green slime that destroys everything it touches.
Start teletransport, immediately.
We've already wasted too much time here.
Yes, your highness.
You belong to this trash heap.
Rot here with the rest of this junk.
Set a course for althurbar.
I've been away from the capital for too long.
We should never have involved you in this mess.
No signal from roswell.
I guess he didn't...
It's all our fault.
There's no way... it's over.
Why did we fall for that stupid old legend?
That worm in a bowl was right.
We're just a bunch of useless goofs.
That's it!
Gana gobler was right!
Come on, this is no time for you to be picking on the little guys.
The green slime is the essence of the invas.
Huh?
These ships aren't the inva's treasure, don't you remember what the king said?
"In the cave you'll find something"
"that will destroy the best equipped armies!"
This green slime has the power to destroy any technology.
This is the inva treasure.
What a nice treasure.
These old spaceships are here just to show how this stuff works!
Wow!
But, how we gonna get out of here?
Ha!
You mean this junk?
It's the raw material we need.
I'm in, gregorio.
That could work.
That caterpillar will get what it deserves!
Oh, you really are silly.
They must be on their way.
I'm sorry my dear, but I have to tell you, we're all gonna die!
Gobler is up to something bigger.
If we are still alive that's because he needs us.
Sooner or later that hiding nose-dirt will come out.
Who threw this in my chair?
Gobler!
Your highness, I... i didn't know you were back.
Call the leaders and convince them to join us.
Oh, gana, shouldn't we wait for things to calm down a little bit?
You know, the relationship between me and them is not at its best...
Oh, you lazy pachyderm!
Leave it to me.
Take them to the boulevard.
I'm going to make them a little offer they won't be able to refuse.
How nice it is that you all came to see me.
We need to talk.
Let me be straight with you people.
This confederation thing just wasn't working.
All this, "respect primitive species..."
And "don't interfere with planets in development."
Blah, blah, blah...
Wake up!
There are a few advanced cultures in the galaxies.
Who could forget how superior we are?
Lower species should take a lesson from us!
You are going to get what you deserve, gana!
I'm afraid I have a little bad news for you, miss inva.
Your teacher had to leave and she won't be coming back.
What's the problem with using forgotten planets as garbage dumps?
Recycling is a waste of time, look at me.
Nature needs to be modified.
Isn't that irresistible?
Oh!
No one will take part in your perverse alliance!
Very well.
You can't say I didn't give you a chance.
Execute the prisoners?
But that was never agreed to!
Killing all the leaders in the galaxy was never part of our plan!
I would not have agreed with you had I known this before!
Oh, so you don't agree?
Oh!
You can't do this!
Calm down, you'll have to wait your turn.
Captain, we've sighted a squadron of ships approaching the main boulevard.
We're coming!
Feel the power of the slime.
Now!
Ugh!
Excellent!
Distract the soldiers while we try to free the prisoners.
Follow me, guys!
Your highness?
We had a little set back.
We... we are being attacked.
An unknown fleet, sir.
Our first response squadron was destroyed.
Those invas!
They've already gotten to the other side of the capital.
Go after them!
Good job!
Phoebe, that's not a place for little kids.
Get back into the ship and stay there!
Don't touch anything and don't open the door for anyone.
Ah!
This passageway goes straight to the central dungeon.
Oh!
I'm all right, I'm all right!
Uh?
Ah!
Did I ever tell you how great you look in that aquarium?
Still trying to save the universe with those stupid, irritating jokes?
It's not going to happen.
Commander, close the air ducts to the dungeon.
Where's gregorio?
I don't know how, but I think he must have gotten lost on the way.
I'm in trouble!
Can't shake them!
I'll cover for you!
Just in time with the green slime.
I love these spaceship games!
But this game doesn't have, "continue."
Hmm?
Oh, now it's hide-and-seek.
I already told you, I don't play games, you insignificant brat.
Uh?
I think our job is done.
Looks like the party is still raging.
Get ready to go into ground-war mode!
Now we'll find out if this junk really works.
I'm out of ammunition!
Any of you dudes got some slime left?
I still got some... uh...
Not anymore.
Take that, tin man!
Ouch, that hurt!
This is a little harder than we thought!
Yes sir, your highness!
Enforcements moving.
Yeah!
What is the status of the prisoners?
Call dropped again.
You need to change your carrier.
Now you are going to pay for every stupid joke!
This is gonna take a while, then.
What don't you understand?
We came here to rescue you!
Are you serious?
They came here risking everything!
Against monsters, robots, enemy spaceships, and even gana gobler, just to save you!
You bunch of narrow-minded alien bosses.
Our arrogance has made us blind.
It's true, it's true.
You're gonna trust them?
Well done.
Now, how do we get out of here?
Good question, we haven't thought of that yet.
Come out, come out, annoying boy.
This is so boring.
Look... my favorite little monster.
You know what's the most disgusting thing about you?
You swim in the same place as you do your, well... you know.
Hmm.
Hey!
We can't win, retreat!
Ah, this is getting pretty ugly.
Loser!
What'd you guys do to these robots?
Now you're gonna die.
I always wanted to say that.
Game over, monster in a bottle.
I don't think so.
Back off, and I promise to hurt you just a wee little.
Game over!
Yes!
Free the earthling, gobler!
Don't come any closer, or I'll finish the kid.
Stay where you are, gobler!
Let my brother go, you road-kill vermin.
I said, take your hands off my brother!
Oh, let the little girl come for the ride.
It'll be so much fun.
You shall not pass!
Uh?
And I thought the invas were the dumbest creatures in the universe.
You don't have a chance, brat.
It's gonna be easy to lock this one up.
And?
And thanks, sis.
You saved me.
You saved the whole universe.
You are my darling heroes!
I knew I could count on you.
In the first place, you were wrong to align yourself with this...
This... evil worm!
You are charged with treason to the confederation.
But it couldn't be helped, I was tricked.
You will pay for your unfaithfulness.
You'll be in prison right next to your friend here.
The confederation is eternally indebted to the invas!
It was our duty, sir.
But we couldn't have done it without the help of our friends from earth.
There's a great deal of work to be done here, now.
There are many things that need to be rebuilt.
And now, I dedicate the new confederation monument.
That's me, look!
Come on, that's obviously me.
You guys are blind.
Clearly, that's my nose.
As a new confederation governor,
I congratulate the heroes, responsible for our freedom!
You know, you still owe me for that ride.
And now, it's your turn!
Really?
I got a better idea.
Uh, mine!
The gadgetgang in outer space!
I've never seen anything like this!
I don't ever recall there been a kinetic model, fantastic.
I think we are looking at the winner.
Oh, oh, yes, these kids certainly deserve the gold!
How did you get the planets to go around in their orbits like this?
Uh...
Oh, that's simple.
First, we magnetize the planets, then we polarize them with electron crystals.
Of course, with a few distortions...
But not visible to the human eye.
Which class are you from?
They're the new exchange students.
