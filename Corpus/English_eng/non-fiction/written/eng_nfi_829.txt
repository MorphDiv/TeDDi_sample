Is she in there?
I don't see her.
No, baby.
That's just a skin sack full of bones.
Why didn't she take her body?
On account of all the pain and sorrow it soaked up.
What happens in life writes a story in our flesh.
What's gonna happen to her body?
When we're done here, they'll take this box and bury it deep.
Can I go with?

Now, dry your eyes and say your peace to your mother.
Goodbye, mama.
There's been a complication.
Anything serious?
I'll fill you in when I get back.

I just have one more...
One more stop to make.
Migraines again?

Kathryn nemec, your references are outstanding.
Fluent in Italian, French, German and Russian.
Most of your charges appear to have been in various diplomatic corps.
I enjoy travel.
You attended medical school at Northwestern, yet you decided not to continue.
May I ask why?
Human anatomy was my Waterloo.

Yes, gruesome.
No.
I found them compelling.
Much more interesting than our living patients.
I decided it would be healthier to reorient my efforts from the end of life to its beginning.
Thus a master's degree in child development.
There's no vocation more critical than raising a child.
It's my belief one can't be overqualified.
This job will not be without its challenges.
I have no interest in abdicating my role as a mother.
While I am in this house,
I will be responsible for tending to masha's needs.
You and masha will join me whenever you can, but there will be times I need to be unencumbered.
So, my primary duty will be to care for the child?
When I'm gone, yes.

You will have one job, and that is to discreetly observe our interactions.
During my absences,
I will expect you to provide a continuity of care.
The way I dress her, hold her, change her, bathe her.
You will be what I am to her.
With one exception.
Yes?
You will not love her.
You are safe.

You are wise.
How many children have you raised?
I've seen seven children through their elementary years.
Some of them siblings, of course.
What do you feel toward them now?
Pride, mostly.
You want to know if I love them?
They were never mine to love.
But I would've died for each and every one of them.
What must a child do to earn this eternal devotion of yours?
Not much.
Take masha, for instance.
We have a pact, she and I.
Every time she takes a bottle from me or falls asleep in my arms, she's telling me that she trusts me completely.
That is a profound gift.
I would do anything to protect your baby.
The forecast, which remains cold this morning, warming up a bit this afternoon with a few sunny breaks and diminishing wind.
Today's high near 33 degrees.
Clear tonight, with the temperature dropping to a low of 19.
I have a reservation for room 8.
There you go.
I reserved room 8.
The young couple in there extended their stay.
What can you do?
Is the adjacent room empty?
For god's sake, what in the hell are you crying about?
Stop crying!
- Just stop yelling at me!

I cannot have these girl episodes with the nagging and...
Are you hurt?

Alexander will be home soon.

Go upstairs.

While you do what?
Clean the mess.
Go.
- All the time, you...

I don't know when I'll be back.

Jason!
You've got to be...
Yo, come on!

Come on!
I have a pack in my trailer.
Okay, sure, lady.

Sweet ride.
Good morning.

I considered killing you last night.
Why didn't you?
What you saw, it's more than Alexander, or anyone, knows about me.
Except the people I work for.
Soviet intelligence?
There were some documents on the man...
Where's the body?

Kate, there are specific ways...
I sealed him in plastic wrap, after I exsanguinated the corpse in the tulip garden to speed the rate of decay.
I buried the rest below the frost line so that the grave won't heave open during the freeze and thaw cycles.
I never expected to have this conversation with you.
What you saw last night...
You might see other things, too.
I told you, I have a pact with your daughter.
I will do everything in my power to keep her safe.
And her mother.
Have you seen my boyfriend?
He went for smokes last night.

Maybe he ran out on you.
No, he left his car.
Did he leave his keys?

Maybe he left them for you.

He's a total dick.

Christ, what the hell is he up to?
Now I gotta go find him.
You do that, dearie.
Do you wanna ask me something, Kate?
It's none of my business.
I'm sorry to put you in that uncomfortable position, especially with masha.
Is he American?
He's an assignment, was an assignment.
I don't know what he is.

Married.
Is it serious?

It's frivolous, exciting, dangerous.
Do you love him?
I don't know about love, Kate.
In my job...
The only one I know I love is masha.
Then you should end it with the American.
Thank you.
Wait, miss?
What happened?
Masha was abducted.

A man was seen carrying her off the campus.
A blonde man.

I started pulling away.

He didn't take it well.
What, he stole masha to hurt you?
No, that's not it.
He thinks she's his.
Is she?

I never found out.
I didn't want to.

I was never going to end up with Raymond.
Did you give the police his name?
Never.

I know where he's taking her.
Home to America.
I'm going to have to go find her on my own.
Not on your own.
Firefighters are gathering and continue to battle a three-alarm Blaze that occurred at a residence downtown.
The cause is unknown at this time.
And we'll keep you updated ast the story unfolds.
My god!
Are you okay?

There was a fire.
Too many people.

And masha...
What?
Listen carefully.

Speak to no one.

Don't go out unless you absolutely have to.
You're hurt.

When it's safe,
I'll call with instructions.
I'll ring once, hang up and call back.
Understand?

Lock the door behind me.
Do you have any fours?
In English, please.
Go fish.
I asked you if you had kings and you said no!
You little sneak!

Do you love me, nyanya?
Yes.
I miss mama.

She is working very hard to find us a new place to live.
And then we'll all be together again.
Where are you?

You need to come back for your daughter.
It's been over a week.
I can't.

Both sides are tracking me down.
I have to leave the country.
It'll be weeks before I can come for masha.
Masha can't stay in a motel that long, she needs a home.
I can take her to my sister in Chicago.
No, you're the family nanny.

They'll track you.
You have to leave masha with someone unconnected, who I can trust.
I want you to get in touch with Sam milhoan.

Kearney, Nebraska.
Leave masha?
You must.
I'm sorry you had to drive all this way, but I'm in no position to help here.
I told Kat...

Sure did, and she sent you anyway.
She told me that you are the only person who knew both her and Raymond, the only one they both trusted.
Yeah, well, that may be...
Of all the people in the world, she chose you to protect her daughter.
All right, all right, stop.
Did Kat happen to mention that I'm a grifter?
I scam people out of their hard-earned cash.
Now, I'm trying to go straight here.
But I don't have room in my life for a kid.
I'm not able to be with masha.
I would just put her life at risk.
You're not gonna stay with me?
You said when we find a place to live we would all be together.
I want that more than anything in the world.
It just can't be now.
You promised.
Crap.
Cargo, go on.
Hi.
Hey, hey.
The kid needs her mother.
But until the heat's off, she's got me.
Katarina?

I'm going crazy in this place.

So, when are you coming back for masha?
I can't.
I'm going away.
What?
What about masha?
Masha's still with Sam and he's...
Please.

I can take care of her.

She won't be safe with you, you know that.
You... you have to disappear yourself, Kate.
There's nothing more you can do, for me or for masha.
I'm begging you, Kate.

You know how much I love her.
I do.
You'll walk away, then?
Yes.
I love you, Kate.
Look at this.
You okay?
Yeah.
Hope you don't mind.
I need saving from the wolves.
If I had a hose, I'd spray 'em down.
I'm just passing through to Texas.
My name's Annie kaplan.

Kate.
You wanna dance, Kate?
What?
Come on.
What's wrong, Kate?
My friend just died.
Honey, come here.
I think she was my best friend.
So, what's next for you?
You gonna find some more Russians to live with?
I don't know.
I can't think about it right now.
Masha and her family were my whole world for so long.
Well, there are other worlds out there.
My future's in amarillo.
A lot of people sing about amarillo, you know.
George strait, Neil sedaka, rob zombie.
Is that what's leading you there?
No, that would be my uncle nikos.
He's a bail bondsman.
Gonna teach me everything he knows about the business.
Amarillo.
What's the job market like there?
Hey, I got off work early and I thought I'd...
Kate, how do you do this?
It takes some work.
You wash down the area with bleach, and then you have to use this epa-approved disinfectant...
There are a lot of jobs in amarillo that don't require being around blood and body organs all day long.
It doesn't bother me.
I know.
But that was before.
Before what?
Before me.
Take those off.
I want to meet the woman who plays peek-a-boo, who reads fairy tales, who makes funny faces at babies.
I never make funny faces at babies, ever.
Promise me you'll think about a change of venue, for me.
For you.
Okay?
Okay.
Everett oldfield.
August 11th, 2006.
Died of blunt force trauma to the right temple.
Knee surgery scar, likely acl reconstruction, left leg.
Wedding ring, left hand.
Simple gold band, inscription "all my love..."
Hey, I thought you were working tonight.
The pattersons canceled their dinner plans.
They wanted a family night in with the kids instead.
So, I got the night off.
Is that chicken and black bean sauce I smell?
Here, open it.
You know, little nikos does not like it when employees eat at the office.
Well, little nikos can suck it.
Romantic and saucy, I like it.
Where's little nikos?
I'm sorry, sir, we're closed.

I missed my court appearance 'cause my daddy passed.
I was at his funeral.
There was no reason for nikos to send his dog mato after me.
That psychopath just broke my brother's jaw looking for me.
Okay, just take this, all right?

We don't want any trouble.
I don't want your money!
Who are you?

Annie kaplan.
I guess that makes you Mr. kaplan.
Get your hand off that phone!
Don't you point that gun at her!
Annie!

God.

Annie!

Okay, okay.
My god, no.
Annie, no, no, no!
Annie, stay awake.
Annie, don't close your eyes.
Stay... stay awake.
Kate.
Hello, Kate.
Can you hear me?

Do you remember the shooting?
Yeah.
Fortunately, the bullet caught you at an angle.
It was a perforating wound, in and out.
No vital tissue was damaged.
There was quite a bit of swelling.
We had to induce a coma to reduce it, give your brain time to heal.
How long?
It's been three weeks, Kate.
Look, they even installed an upgrade.
Metal plate.
Nikos.
Where's Annie?
I'll let you two talk.
Nikos, where's Annie?
I'm sorry, Kate.
She was gone before the ambulance even got there.
Listen to me.
Annie was my family.
I know how she felt about you.
How you felt about each other.
And that makes you family.
I will be here for you, and we will get through this together.
How?
Sam.
What are you doing here?
Is it Elizabeth?

No, no, no.

Nothing happened.
Then what are you doing here?
Someone wants to see you.
Asked me to come to you.
Raymond reddington.
That man set off a chain reaction that took everything I loved from me.
And not just me, he turned his back on his family, his country, and for what?
A life of crime?
He's a traitor.
I have nothing to say to him, and I don't want to hear anything he has to say to me.
Yes, you do.

But red says she's in danger.
What kind of danger?
You'd have to ask him.
And there's something he wants to ask you.
Work for you?
I don't know you.
I'm not as unknown as you might like to believe, miss nemec.
We shared the affection of Katarina.
We have a common bond in Elizabeth.
I presume your love for the child abides.
After Katarina's sudden departure,
I felt a responsibility to watch over the girl from a distance.
I've provided for her and Sam financially.
I'm surprised you found the time.
Between selling illegal services or ordering hits on anyone who got in your way.
I make no apologies for who I am, or what I do.
Katarina was a traitor to two countries, both global superpowers.
God willing, Katarina's daughter will live a private life of quiet courage.
But if anyone learns her identity, the only way I can stop the threats from rising is to rise up as a greater threat than all of them.
So you want me to join you in organized crime to protect Elizabeth?
Yes, Kate.
Help me protect the girl we love.
And what do I have that you could possibly want?
A trusted voice, a cool head.
Undaunted initiative in a messy situation.
All the things that you gave to Elizabeth's mother.
If you ever put me in a position where I have to choose between what's best for you and what's best for her,
I will choose Elizabeth every time.
Yes, I would insist on that.
Hello!

Highway patrol.

Just a second.
Sorry, officer.

You been drinking, ma'am?
No.

But you're parked illegally on a county road.
License and registration, please.
Miss snyder or miss Phillips?

It's not what you think.
What I think is that showing a fake license is a class 4 felony in this state.
Why don't you go ahead and step outside for me, ma'am.
Officer, I can explain.
You'll have a chance to do that, right after I search your vehicle.
Are you refusing my request to search your vehicle?
That is my right.
And it's my right to detain you while I phone in a search warrant and radio for backup.
I sure hope you slept, 'cause this is gonna be a long night.
Wait.
If you call this in, he's going to find me, hurt me.
He's done it before.

He wants to be.
I sympathize, I do.
But fake ids is not the way to handle it.
You need to report the son of a bitch.
Slap a restraining order on him.
It's not that simple.

Whenever something happens, it's his word against mine, and he knows what to say and how to say it.
There are support groups or shelters you can go to.
If your story checks out, I'll even help you find one.
But right now, I need to...
My god.
Did he do that?

Do you have a gun?
I do.
You drive this rig straight to a state with stand-your-ground laws.
Kansas, Georgia, Florida.

Hello, Mr. kaplan.

Better, thank you.
I'm an hour out with the final shipment.
Is there room on the ice?
All organized and ready for you, nothing to worry about.
Assistant director Harold Cooper just arrived at headquarters.
Now would be a good time to move.
You can't just stroll into her life after all these years.
This is a mistake.
I'm aware of your feelings, Kate.
Raymond, stop.
The instant you walk through that door, the damage will be done.
You'll destroy her innocence, everything we've been fighting to preserve.
You'll never undo it.
As I feared would happen, elements from Katarina's past are circling Elizabeth like a pack of wolves in the night.
I put tom keen in her life to keep an eye on her, and he married her.
This isn't about tom keen.
It's about your need for control.
Indeed, I need to control the danger to Elizabeth.
I've built a vast criminal network predicated on that very principle.
It's time to live up to my mission statement.
Must be good to be home again, sir.
Yeah.
Well, we'll see about that.
He'll be fine.

What's the worst that could happen?
Hello, Raymond.
Hello, Kate.
Took some searching, but we found your friend's phone buried in the rubble.
I knew you'd survive the blast.
I tried to warn him, but he was very proud of his bushcraft.
He would've made you proud right to the end.
You know how to engender loyalty in others, Kate.
You always have.
I've been thinking about you.
Happy thoughts?
I realize now I was so wrapped up in helping you build your empire,
I lost sight of why I joined you in the first place.
Somewhere along the way,
I stopped serving Liz's needs to enable yours.
They're one and the same.

What we've done, we've done for her.
I believed that, Raymond.
Like a pied Piper, you made me believe.
But when I did what I thought was best for her...
It wasn't best.
You almost got her killed, and you betrayed me.
No, I kept my word to you.
When you hired me, you told me to choose Elizabeth over you.
And so I tried to help her disappear to a safe place with her newborn daughter.
And for that, you put me down like a mad dog.
For the last two decades of my life, you had me convinced
I was helping keep Elizabeth safe.
But in reality, I was helping you become a monster.
It's time for us to meet and talk.
No, Raymond.

It took a bullet to my head, but I remember what my father taught me.
Our stories are written in flesh.
And I'm going to use that lesson to render you powerless.
Are you familiar with master James of St. George?
Favored architect of Edward I.
Do you know why?
Concentric construction.
He literally built castles within castles.
Impossible to penetrate.
You could breach the outer wall, only to be faced with a heavily fortified gatehouse and barbican and a high inner wall lined with archers.
Pity the poor foot soldier who made it that far.
The architecture of my organization has risen, stone by stone, over decades.
You can't get inside to hurt me, Kate.
You forget I was by your side the whole time.
I know what was required to amass your power.
Who you hurt, who you betrayed, who you killed.
More importantly, as your cleaner,
I know where the bodies are buried.
Were buried, dearie.
And I'm going to use them, and the stories they tell to put you in the ground.
You've been busy.
