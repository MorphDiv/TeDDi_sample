My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,
I was accidentally thrust into the future, and I saw him murder the woman I love.
But I won't let that happen.
I'm going to do everything in my power to change the future, and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.
I am The Flash.
Previously on The Flash...
When I threw the Philosopher's Stone into the Speed Force, I accidentally ran into the future.
I saw Savitar murder you.
I wasn't fast enough to save you.
We can't do this alone, Barry.
Why don't you come work with us?
You can help Team Flash fight meta-humans.
If his powers are linked to the energy that ties together the multiverse...
He can open a breach to any Earth he wants.
The thing they never tell you about fighting villains is that nothing ever stays the same.
The harder you work to take down the bad guys, the more they up their game.
Gentlemen, welcome to the future of crime.
Not even the military has these yet.
Looks like Christmas came early.
You know what the only problem is?
You're on Santa's naughty list.
Christmas is canceled.
Fortunately, our team has a secret weapon of its own:
A man of science, a man of action, and that man's name is H.R. Wells.
Look who has a vortex cannon.
Ho, ho, ho.
With a blast from my trusty vortex cannon,
I dispatch the miscreant...
They need you at Keystone Bridge.
Surely all your adventures are not this disorganized?
There's a method to the madness, mate.
Watch and learn.
The Electric Gang is headed north.
You gotta cut 'em off before they reach the freeway.
Hey.
How you wanna play this?
I have an idea.
Eyes up!
Here he comes.
Just the red one.
Nice work.
They're out cold.
Okay, boys.
They saved us.
They saved us!
I'm Kid Flash.
Yes.
Whoo.
Nice save!
Could not have scripted it better myself.
Thanks.
Barry did most of the heavy lifting.
Yes, bravo, boys.
Although I did find at least six ways you could have done it more efficiently, just... just saying.
I mean, the busload of hot cheerleaders seemed like the way that we did things.
So exactly how many hot cheerleaders?
I was a good boy.
Well, I'm glad you have his back.
We have each other's back.
It's actually been really nice having him out there.
Hey, I meant to ask you.
When you found the Electric Gang, did you see them meeting with anyone else?
Don't you think that's something for the police to handle?
I'm still a journalist, Barry.
I can't hide from the world because of what you saw.
See you at home.
Can't lose her, Cisco.
Please tell me you found a way to change the future.
We found a way to change the future.
Did you really?
No, but Caitlin and I did find a way to map it.
Julian suggested we make a 3-D reconstruction of the scene from the future exactly as we saw it.
With toys.
The medium's not important.
Is this me?
Why is he an astronaut?
Eye on the ball, Barry, okay?
Now, this diorama tells us you need to cover this distance in less than 0.21 seconds if you want to save Iris from Savitar.
What do you guys think?
Think what you're proposing is impossible.
Multi-universe is maybe a new concept to me, but mathematics is not.
Pay attention, Allen.
This is your speed timeline.
This is your maximum velocity when you first acquired your powers.
This is your current top speed, and this is where you need to be in May to cover that distance in 0.21 seconds.
At your current rate of improvement, impossible.
Wow.
Thank you for that rousing pep talk, coach.
Okay, why don't you take a knee?
I think we got it covered here.
It looks like it.
I actually have to be back at CCPD.
As do you.
Cheerio.
He really does want to help in his own snobbish, thoughtless way.
He is right.
I mean, he's kind of a dick about it, but you can't argue with his math.
Okay, well, then, we'll find another way to make this work.
We need to.
Iris isn't gonna die.
Thank you very much.
Gotcha.
Freeze!
How'd you get in here?
You know what they say.
Every time a door closes...
A window opens.
Barry.
Safe's not touched.
I mean, it seems like a lot to go through to just get a late night cup of coffee, right?
Yeah, it's definitely a meta.
I'll have Julian look into his meta database, but I think this is someone new.
New and dangerous.
Well, it's nothing that The Flash and Kid Flash can't handle.
My two superhero boys.
He is doing great.
Speaking of my kids,
Iris, she tell you about this arms dealer story she's following?
Yeah, she's mentioned it.
Well, now that you're her live-in boyfriend, could you look out for her and maybe get her to back off a bit?
Because this isn't something she should be doing on her own.
She seem... okay to you, otherwise?
If you guys got something going on,
I hope you know you can talk to me.
Yeah, I know, Joe.
Okay.
Yeah.
So this is the footage from Jitters that should help us ID our new meta.
I'll clean that up.
Look how clear the picture is on that screen.
That's 'cause that's not from Jitters.
That's our security footage.
H.R. Wells.
I know you're in there.
Come quietly if you don't want trouble.
H.R., how does she know you?
Her name is Gypsy, and she's what's known on my Earth as a collector.
What is she collecting?
She's come to collect, you know, me.
You can vibe?
I like it.
Slow down there.
Let's just talk about this, like two adults, over coffee, or maybe dinner, if you prefer that.
There's a great Thai place up the road, if you like Thai.
It's nice to meet you.
Are you asking her on a date?
Are you kidding me?
I am negotiating.
Well, you showed me yours.
Only fair I show you mine.
Cisco!
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the building.
Speedster.
That's fun.
I like to have fun too.
I see you've got a lot to learn about your power.
You're harboring a fugitive from justice.
Our world has a strict ban on inter-dimensional travel.
He knew that when he came here.
Not when he's beaming "H.R. Wells'".
Adventures in the Multiverse" back chapter by chapter.
Not without going through us.
If I really wanted to go through you, you would all be dead.
I've got a lock on you now.
There is no getting away.
You've got an hour to get your affairs in order, and then you are coming back with me.
Adios, Cisco.
What an exit.
"As Francisco threw back his lustrous locks
"and laughed, I outlined my plan for neutralizing the rampaging creature."
It goes on like this for pages.
He's been broadcasting this without our knowledge or permission, all the while making himself the hero.
Yeah, every book needs a central protagonist that the audience can invest in.
I would have gone with Barry.
Barry?
Cisco, what was that back there?
First Golden Glider and now her?
I can't help who I'm attracted to, even if it is the... sexy, intense, deadly ones.
So she takes you back to Earth-19, and, what, you pay a fine?
The punishment for an unauthorized breach travel on my Earth... it's death.
Death?
About 24, 25 years ago, a neighboring Earth invaded our planet through a breach and almost destroyed the place.
So to prevent it from happening again, they banned all inter-dimensional travel.
And then they put the collectors in place to punish those of us who violated the ban.
I didn't think that she'd track me down.
So why would you risk your life by coming here?
It's time for H.R. to face the music.
Guys, I know H.R. can be annoying, but he doesn't deserve to die.
Different Earth, different morality.
In the future, with me and Iris and Savitar, he was there.
I mean, that must mean we don't let her take him back.
Maybe we do.
Maybe by letting him go back to his Earth, it changes your future and prevents Iris' death.
I gotta go see her.
Are you just gonna let this woman take H.R.?
I don't know.
I wish I knew if it would make a difference.
You know, I mean, what if he goes and nothing changes?
How do we ever know if our actions now impact the future?
Yeah.
You know, sometimes I wish we had normal-people problems.
Yeah, that would be nice.
Hey, you didn't tell Joe about the future, did you?
No, of course not.
The last thing I need is for him to worry about something four months away that might not happen.
That won't happen.
That won't happen.
Maybe in the meantime, you could let this arms dealer thing go?
God, did my dad put you up to this too?
No, he didn't have to.
I'm not trying to keep you from doing your job, okay?
But when we're all focused on this H.R. thing and trying to prevent the future.
I mean, do we really need to go looking for more trouble?
Please?
Okay, I'll drop it.
Um, yes.
Sometimes I do listen to you, you know?
That hasn't been my experience.
Shut up.
Don't you get tired of running?
That's the thing, running just sort of keeps my mind off of things, I guess.
Must be an amazing feeling.
It is.
You know, cracking a big story gives me an amazing feeling.
That, arms dealer thing?
How do you know about that?
Because both Dad and Barry want you to lay off of it.
The phrase "death wish" got tossed around a lot by them.
Okay, I do not have a death wish.
I just want to see justice done like everyone else in this building.
I get that, but it is dangerous, Iris.
Wally, how dangerous could it be?
I don't die till May.
Barry said that in Flashpoint, you and I were a brother-sister crime-fighting team.
I say we make that a reality again.
Shouldn't we ask Barry first?
No, this is just between us, Wally.
We can do this together.
Do you know what I'm really gonna miss about this Earth?
I mean, a long, winding story served up daily in hour-long chapters?
You never answered Caitlin's question.
About why I put mustard on my fries?
Why you risked your life to come here.
That.
I looked in a mirror.
I don't follow.
Look, on my Earth,
I had fame and power.
I had respect.
I was "H.R. Wells."
But when I looked in the mirror,
I knew the truth.
And the truth was...
I didn't matter.
I was a fraud.
That is why I came to this Earth, so I could rewrite my story, both literally and figuratively.
There's gotta be something you can do, H.R.
There's not.
There's nothing I can do, B.A.!
I don't mean to snap at you.
Unless, of course, I appeal for trial by combat.
Guys, Gypsy's here.
Always so punctual.
I'm impressed!
Thought you'd try and flee again.
Time to go.
All right.
Gypsy, take me home.
Wait.
You're not taking him anywhere.
Because I challenge you to trial by combat.
What are you doing?
I'm challenging her to trial by combat.
No, no, he isn't.
Well, that one spoke first.
By the laws of Earth-19, I hereby challenge you for possession of H.R. Wells.
If you want, we can solve this another way.
There's a great spot for drinks...
You realize trial by combat is to the death?
Listen, you want him?
You're gonna have to come and claim him.
I take it you also want the customary 24 hours to prepare?
Do I want the customary...
Yes, you do.
I would love to take advantage of the customary 24 hours, if you don't mind.
Very well.
One day.
One day.
See you then.
She's gonna kill me, isn't she?
She's good.
She's great.
I mean, Gypsy is a legend on my Earth.
So why, exactly, did you agree to fight her?
I don't know.
You did what any of us would have done.
I might not have done it, just being honest.
What are my chances here, scale of one to ten?
She's gonna kill you.
It's a pretty solid "one," mate.
You have the same powers Gypsy does, right?
I mean, she's not doing anything you can't do.
You can do this, okay?
You just need a little practice and a little confidence.
And we're all gonna help you with that, right?
Hey.
I believe in you, all right?
You can beat her.
Listen, I have some ideas for a training regimen I can set up in here.
Caitlin, why don't you get the medical bay prepared in the meantime?
For when you... beat her, when you beat her, she's gonna... she's gonna need medical attention.
'Cause you will beat her, I have every faith that you're going to beat her.
We need to work on your interpersonal skills.
I was really trying.
Has anyone ever beat her?
Yeah.
No.
Okay.
Well, I've officially reached a nice, comfortable level of just straight-up panic.
I mean, you don't even like me.
Why would you risk your life for me?
You're not like the other Wellses.
Yeah, so you keep reminding me.
No, I mean, those two, they were geniuses.
We depended on them.
But with you, the roles are reversed.
You depend on us.
Harrison Wells was always there for me, so I guess in some weird way, I just...
I want to be there for Harrison Wells.
So what are we doing here?
I thought you didn't want Dad to know we're going after this arms dealer.
Yeah, no, I don't.
But, um, actually,
I need you to swipe his file on the case and photograph the pages and then put them back.
Thanks.
What?
Iris.
Have you lost your mind?
Dad will kill us.
No, no, Wally, he won't.
He won't even know that Kid Flash was there.
First, you have to tell me why.
Okay, look.
I know everyone is working really hard to prevent Savitar from...
Yeah.
But, honestly, these could be my last few months on Earth.
Can you not talk like that?
I'm just being realistic, Wally.
I get to do that.
Look, I want my life to mean something, more than just a daughter or as a sister or as a girlfriend, but as a reporter.
This story can do that.
It can say that I, Iris West, mattered.
You know, my life was a lot easier before I had a sister.
But it's a lot better now, isn't it?
Come on.
Okay.
I can get you the no-knock warrant, but, Joe, this guy is armed to the teeth with God only knows what.
You're gonna have to move in there fast and hard.
"Fast and hard," okay, I kind of walked into that...
Hi, Iris.
Um, Dad, can I borrow you for a second for a little father-daughter talk?
I need to go catch up with Captain Singh, so I will be back in a little while, yeah?
Can I talk to you for a second over here?
Um...
Yeah, so, um,
I wanted to... to speak to you about me and Barry.
You and Barry?
So there comes a time in every couple's relationship when you realize that there is too much love for two people.
And...
When that happens, you know in your heart that the only solution is to make your family a little... bigger.
Okay, I'm gonna need a second.
Dad, hey, hey, listen to me very closely.
This is so important to me.
God.
Um...
Um...
Is Barry a dog or a cat person?
What?
Yeah, what kind of animal does he like?
Because I was thinking about getting him a pet and I don't really remember him having a preference.
Man, you had me going there for a second.
What, what did you think I was talking about?
Nothing, nothing, I... you can get him any kind of animal you want as long as it has four legs.
Good, great advice, four legs, copy that.
Damn.
Yeah.
Hopefully in the next 21 hours and 46 minutes.
All right, look, whenever I'm out there,
I'm in a tough fight, I think maybe I don't have it,
I just take a deep breath...
Trust my instincts.
Trust my instincts, that's good.
That helps.
Guys?
Up here.
We can't let Francisco fight Gypsy, because if he does, he is a dead man.
We're supposed to stop her before she fights him.
That would be great if we knew where she was.
A magician friend told me you kind of distract 'em and tag...
I needed to know where she was so I could stay one step ahead of her.
She is...
All right.
This world may be a primitive, uncultured backwater, but they do make an excellent cup of coffee.
You gotta try the Brazilian roast, it's new.
It is so good.
Maybe I'll take a few bags back with me.
Yeah, think that's wise.
Will you be going back in a bag?
Look, that kid, Francisco, he's just trying to protect me.
Then he's as foolish as he is cute.
Okay, Gypsy.
Let's go home.
Nice try!
You think I didn't see that coming?
Stop, stop!
Stop trying to enforce the law?
You are a criminal.
Now, it's great that you made friends here, but that doesn't change the fact that you lied.
You broke our most sacred laws, and now it is time for you to face justice.
Wait!
You still need to face Cisco.
No, I think this little stunt forfeits his claim.
And his time.
You just said you believe in the law, right?
We made a mistake.
Cisco will hold up his end of the deal.
He will.
You have really pulled a number on these people if they would die for you.
Tell Cisco there is no backing out now.
I'll keep this one as insurance until then.
That's not good.
She took H.R.?
Can she do that?
I mean, I though this whole trial by combat thing had rules.
Which apparently we broke when we tried to get the drop on her.
Well, that wasn't very clever, was it?
A deal is a deal.
And our deal was that I would train so that I could fight Gypsy, but I guess you two wanted to go behind my back and try to sub in?
We didn't go... we just thought maybe you could use some help.
Well, right now, my instincts are telling me I should be writing my last will and testament, so please excuse me.
Cisco, come...
Should I go talk to him?
No, I...
I got it.
Looks like I'm not the only one who has to work on their interpersonal skills.
Hey.
I'd be careful if I were you.
Last thing we want is for me to touch a button and blow your head off, right?
'Cause I don't know what I'm doing, right?
You know I don't think that.
Yeah, well, you have a very, very strange way of showing it.
I was always able to do it before, you know?
I mean, against Reverse Flash and then against Zoom, but...
Savitar's on a whole other level.
And knowing what he'll do to Iris if I fail?
I'm afraid just... thinking what's gonna happen to H.R. if I don't beat Gypsy.
By just leaning on all of you guys.
You know, I mean, you're always in my corner, helping me face my fears.
And when you are, I'll be there in your corner.
Yes, lovely little speech, Allen.
But what Mr. Ramon needs to defeat his inter-dimensional adversary is a practical stratagem.
Lucky for you, I found one.
This is Gypsy's signature move.
I call it her "breach and blast".
You see just before she comes in and out of a breach, her feet come off the ground.
So for that split second she's off the ground, she'll be off-balance.
Yes, and vulnerable.
It might behoove you to use this during the battle.
This is great, Julian.
Just glad I could be helpful.
Thanks.
You sure this is the place?
You ready to bust an arms dealer?
CCPD's been looking for this guy for months.
He might have some sort of secret tunnel network that helps him slip out and get away.
I should do a quick recon.
We don't want to miss anything, okay?
Be back in a you-know-what.
Hope you like what you see, 'cause this sneak preview is gonna cost you your life.
Yeah, I don't think so.
Are you crazy?
This'll rip a hole right through you.
Everyone's gotta go sometime, right?
And I am pretty sure today just... isn't my day.
What the hell, sis?
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
God, okay, look, we gotta get you out of here before CCPD sees you.
He's totally cool with me doing stuff like this.
Hell no, I ain't cool with this.
You two almost compromised a major CCPD sting operation that took the DA's office months to assemble.
You still got the guy, right?
That is not the point, Iris.
The point is, you had you and your brother out there in danger, and for what?
Dad, this is more than just a story for me.
Yeah, which you almost got shot for.
God.
What?
Iris.
What is going on with you?
We'll be right back.
Joe already suspects something's up.
You going out there like that, it just hangs a bell on it.
This story is going to change lives, Barry.
Why do you think that you're the only one allowed to risk your life to do good?
I don't.
It's okay to be afraid of the future.
But I won't let you die.
I am not afraid to die, Barry, I'm not.
Then what?
I'm afraid...
What if I end up just like my mom?
Just gone without making a mark, without leaving anything behind.
Iris, your mom, she left something behind.
She left a brave, wonderful son and the woman that I love.
All right?
I don't know what the future holds, none of us do.
I know that we will face it together.
Gypsy just vibed me her location.
Let's do this.
I don't think the literary critics on our Earth would know a real sci-fi romance best seller
Looks like your so-called friend is a coward after all.
He's not a coward.
He's one of the finest men I've ever known.
You're right about that!
I'm fine as hell.
There he is.
Didn't think you'd show.
I wouldn't miss an evening with you, even if it is for a showdown.
I will kill you, Cisco.
We'll see who dies tonight.
To the victor goes H.R. Wells.
May the best vibe win.
Part of me was hoping you wouldn't show tonight.
How do you want to do this?
"Westworld" style, back to back, ten paces, turn and shoot?
No.
This does not bode well.
Cisco can hold his own.
Barely.
Barry, we can't let this happen.
What if he can't defeat her?
I can't interfere again.
At this rate, Cisco's gonna be the dead man.
Ooh, girl!
You done did it now!
Stronger than I thought.
I'm just getting warmed up.
Yeah, maybe not do that.
Time to turn things up to 11.
"Spinal Tap."
That's, like, one of my favorite movies...
Where did they go?
I... they could be anywhere by now.
In any universe.
This is Earth-2.
You're cute, but you talk too much.
You want to play dirty?
Let's play dirty.
That hurts.
That too.
Is it me, or is this city getting weirder?
Well, this is hot.
I think you're flirting with me to distract me 'cause you're afraid.
My collection record is flawless.
In these trials, I am undefeated.
Please.
Everybody's got a weakness.
Even you.
Says the man afraid of showing everyone how powerful he can be.
You and I resonate on a similar frequency.
I can feel it.
Yet you allow your fear and insecurity to hold you back.
That's why you're gonna lose.
Does this look like holding back to you?
You might want to work on your balance next time, girl.
Admit it,
I won.
Yes!
She must have been having an off day.
By the laws of Earth-19, the prisoner is yours for the taking, as is my life.
No, no, no, no.
We don't roll like that around here.
Come on.
In all the multiverse, I have... never... met anyone like you, Cisco.
Please, call me Vibe.
Or... or you can call me Cisco.
That's also allowed.
I'm just a regular guy.
Just a regular... single guy.
It says you're totally fine.
Tell all your superiors that you were bested in battle, all the charges against H.R. are dropped.
No.
I tell them I killed him.
Wait, what?
If I return empty-handed, they'll know I failed.
And I never fail.
Until today.
Okay, but if you tell them that you killed me, then I...
You will never go back to Earth-19, ever.
Do we have a deal?
I don't really have anything to go home for.
You'll always have a home here, H.R.
Listen, I know there's no coffee on your Earth 'cause of the whole Blight thing or whatever, but this... this is just an absurd amount of coffee you're bringing back to your Earth.
That can't be legal.
I mean, I won't tell if you won't.
You know, for someone so fixated on enforcing the law, you sure seem oddly at ease about breaking it.
Well, I guess some laws are worth breaking for the right person.
So this goodbye then?
For now.
Wow.
What an exit.
Okay, you know, for the fastest man alive, you are the slowest reader.
Hey this is your big article.
I'm not gonna rush through it.
You sure sold the hell out of Kid Flash as Central City's next super savior.
I'm sure Wally's loving that.
Well, I did promise him the front page.
But what do you think?
Do you think it'll make any difference?
Kid Flash already changed one thing that we saw in the future.
No, I meant the article.
What?
The article?
I think you should be really proud.
It's the beginning of... an amazing journalistic legacy.
Really?
Time will tell.
Do you know what I realized?
Means I beat him.
And I'm gonna do it again, I promise.
So don't worry.
The Flash is gonna save you.
My hero.
The thing they never tell you is that nothing ever stays the same.
So the harder you work to take down the bad guys, the more they up their game.
No.
Just had to grab some stuff for...
Yeah.
I thought you were finished working with that stuff?
No, it's just, this is just for me.
No, the... the book, it... you know, my own personal sense of accomplishment.
Well, you've accomplished plenty.
What have I accomplished, Francisco?
Well, for one, you got me to risk my life to save yours.
And trust me, my friend, that is a huge accomplishment.
Yeah, about that...
I just want to say that
I appreciate what you did for me.
Yeah, it's what we do for our friends, right?
Besides, it was a way for me to balance the scales.
Balance the scales, right.
What does that mean?
I just mean...
I can't tell you the amount of times that I've been in your shoes and a man with your face has made me feel better.
Yeah, about that, I would...
I would love if you could share some of my doppelganger's knowledge.
I would love to know what the smarter versions of me think.
The first Wells told me my time would come to be a hero, that it was my job to show up, to be ready for when it did.
You know why I love working here?
Why?
We're all making investments in each other.
I made an investment in you, and one day, that investment's gonna pay off when you use that... crazy way of thinking you have to help me out.
I guess if he were here, he would say,
"Show up."
Yeah.
'Cause... one day, you might need to save my ass.
Keep it up at this rate, you're gonna reach Mach 3 soon.
