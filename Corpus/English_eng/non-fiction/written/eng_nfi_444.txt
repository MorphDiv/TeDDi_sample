Previously on Switched at Birth...
- You need to leave.

Toby:

Oh, I get it.

- why you're so mad?

- Listen here, you...

You must go to school with Travis?
Yeah, I go to Carlton.
Oh, you talk!

Turn around, put your hands on your head, now.
You're hurting my pitching arm!
Daphne:

I think someone on the baseball team is using steroids.
I'm using because a cop tried to arrest me, and he strained my rotator cuff.
My dad's gonna yell and lecture, and that's it.
Your mom ordered a mandatory drug test for the whole team.

(laughs)
What happened here?
A little bit?
When I went to bed, this place was a disaster zone.
Now you could eat off the floor.
(sighs) God, I love you.
And to prove it,
I'm gonna take you out for dinner tonight.
With my salary, of course, it's gonna be the food truck of your choice.
I thought Melody was out of town.
(sighs)
Wow, I didn't know that you two had been talking.
That's great.
Oh!
Travis!

I would love to meet your mom.
(phone vibrates)
The health center?
Good.

Hey, man.

Uh, a random drug test.
So, check him in.

We couldn't do nothing.
I'm hoping you're wrong about all this.
Ah, hi.
Dr. Taylor, this is my daughter Daphne.
She is a student volunteer.
She'll be checking in all of the athletes.
- Nice to meet you.

Dr. Taylor is from True Quest Labs.
He'll be administering the test to all of the sports teams in the next two days.
What I'll need from you is pretty simple.
After you log in the players, just mark and track their samples prior to my testing.
It's a lot of athletes, so we need to stay organized.
- Okay?

Are all of the baseball players accounted for?
- John:

- except Chris Walker.

He's been throwing up.

Then he won't mind coming to the health center.
He's got 48 hours.
- Okay?

Bye.
Chris.
Stomach flu?

Trust me, I feel pretty sick to my stomach right now.
So you just skipped the test?

What I was thinking is that if I walked in there this morning,
- I would have failed.

Look, I stopped taking them, okay?
I know what I did was wrong.
The problem is... the drugs won't be out of my system for a week.
- I just need time.

If you don't take the test in the next 48 hours, you're gonna be in huge trouble.

Forty-eight hours?
How do you know that?
I work in the health center, remember?
Of course.

- Chris...

It's because of the injury, because of what that cop did to me.
If I fail this test, I will never get a look with the Royals.
My baseball career will be over.
I can't get you out of taking the test.
It doesn't work like that.
That's not what I'm saying.
I need you to help me cheat.
(theme music plays)
Come in.

Hey, how's your hand?

When you hit Aidan McManus?
Damn it, Travis!
How many times do we got to do this?
I had to bench you last month for fighting with your own teammate.
Aidan's filed a complaint with the athletic department.
It doesn't matter.

That may be, but violence is never the answer.
Now, John is your coach.

Two weekends, campus work detail.
Okay, do you want three?
Okay.

(sighs)
You know, Toby saw the whole thing.
That kid, he was walking around calling people retarded.
- I probably would've hit him myself.

- Well, at least it's over now, right?

Aidan McManus is the son of Leonard McManus.
- The lawyer?

I've seen that guy's TV commercials:
He called my office.

So are we talking, like, Fort Knox level of impenetrability or more like a glorified nanny-cam situation?
Um, somewhere in between.
Uh, there's been a few break-ins in the neighborhood lately.
When I started this business,
I had a big muscle-bound partner in Eric, but now that it's just me, a security system would make me feel a little safer.
What about your bad-ass Special Forces boyfriend?
He's in Cabo right now with his Army buddies.
- That's why I asked you.

I can install it tomorrow, but it's gonna take me the better part of the day.
Plus, it's gonna get kind of noisy and dusty in here.
Well... (sighs).
I've been postponing inventory for weeks now.
So I could just close up and
- kill two birds with one stone.

I'm gonna owe you like a lifetime of coffee.
- Hey.

So did you think about what I said?
I'm not gonna help you cheat.
(door closes) But if you've stopped taking the drug, there's a chance I could help you pass the test.
What drug were you taking?
Colibuterol.
- In what dose?

- And you weigh?

- Time of your last dose?

It'll be tight and I can't guarantee a hundred percent that this will work, but there's a chance.
- You just have to do exactly what I say.

(knock on door)
- Hey!

Oh, hi, honey.

- And you must be Bay.

- Hi!

Oh, it is so nice to meet you.
- I made artichoke dip.

Um, gosh...
I am so happy that you made it.
I...

(laughs) This is China.
China.
- Got it.

(both laugh)
He says your signing's great.
Thanks.
But I am glad that you're here.
It just makes it easier.
Hmm.
Hey!

Oh, I've got a surprise for you.

This is my brother.

Travis.
Good to see you, pal.
Karen:

- This is Travis's girlfriend.

- I always knew this kid had good taste.

- Uh, I hope you don't mind me crashing dinner.

- The more, the merrier.

- Celebrate the reunion?

Come on, I'll find one and... you guys just make yourselves comfortable.
Wow, your mom is so sweet.
Are you okay?
Karen:

I made Travis's favorite.
- It's honey-baked chicken.

Phew!
- Girl, you can run.

I'm more of a "walk out to the mound... "
"... and do my thing" kind of guy.
Well, this is all about speeding up your metabolism.
Those two gallons of water I had you drink, we need you to sweat all of that out, and then we'll replenish your vitamin levels
- to normalize your glucose readings.

Ah, it's just basic human physiology.
Today's about flushing your system, and tomorrow we build it back up.
We need to boost your creatine levels, so that means lots of red meat.
Well, that I got.

- Actually, I'm a vegetarian.

Uh, okay, then, uh, you'll just have to make do
- with the best okra and baked beans ever.

- Hi.

I will have an extra large mango and whatever this beautiful, young genius is having.
(Karen and Eddie laughing)
Eddie:

Oh, he was like a human garbage disposal back then.
(Eddie sighs) He was such a troublemaker.
Karen, you have to see him pitch.

Oh, I'd love to come see a game.
Uh, well, you can't though, 'cause the season's over.
Oh, this is so nice, just
- having us all together again.

Karen:

Eddie was more of a father to Travis than my ex was.
Now, let's not insult the kid's dad.
Oh, you're right.

But we were always so grateful that you were there for us.
He used to come visit every Christmas, and he would always bring Travis those model-airplane kits.
And you guys would put them together in the garage.
Do you remember that, honey?
Did you ask him if he remembered that?
Hey, honey.
Are you okay?
Hey, you haven't touched your food.
You know what?

I can make you something else.
Um, you know what?
It's getting late, actually.

But I made Mississippi mud for dessert.
It's just I have to wake up at the, uh, crack of dawn for work tomorrow, so, uh...
- At a tattoo parlor?

Oh, okay.
Travis?
Stop.
It...

You too.
Bye, honey.
(door opens)
(door closes)
Leonard, I am so glad you came by.
I wanted to thank you in person.
We used your last donation to re-turf the entire football field.
Ah, I'm so glad.

Yes, and I wanted to tell you how sorry we are about what happened to Aidan.
We are disciplining the player in question.
We've given him two consecutive weekends on work detail and a serious reprimand.
I hardly think that's enough punishment
- for a guy who attacked my son.

I think that's a bit of an overstatement.
Do you?
This wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that your daughter happens to be dating
- the player in question, would it?

I think it's a fair punishment.
His jaw is broken.
Really?
His mouth is wired shut.

I ought to be suing the pants off this kid.
I understand that you're angry, but I tell you that there is no money there.
And I think that we should handle this internally for the good of the school.
Actually, I agree with you.
You know how much I care about the athletic department.
I've been very loyal with my checkbook.
You certainly have.
Bottom line:
I don't think Travis Barnes is worthy of our fine program.
What exactly are you saying?
Either that kid's off the baseball team or I'm taking my money elsewhere.
How could he just sit there across from you and pretend like it never happened?
The thought of your mom still being there with him, not knowing who he really is...
Travis, you have to tell her!
She has to know.

But you were so excited about it.
And what?

At least then she would know the truth.
What don't I get?
Oh, Travis.
We will make her believe you.
Okay.
Look, I'm not gonna make you do anything that you do not want to do, okay?
All right, um...
Hey.
I can stay here tonight.
Okay.
(sighs)
(clattering)
Daphne:

And the corn bread, oh my God!
I'm telling you, if you had a little taste of these beef ribs, you'd give up being vegetarian forever.
He's right about that, honey.
(laughter)
For real, Aunt Mae should've had her own restaurant.
That's 'cause she's the best damn cook west of the Mississippi.
- Aren't you, Mae Mae?

Well, I need to get this recipe.
Hmm, I don't know.
I don't give that recipe out to just anybody.
But I might make an exception for the girl Chris is sweet on.
- Oh, we're just friends.

I know a budding romance when I see it.
I'm just helping Chris with some training.
Daphne's dad is my coach, Coach K.
He's the one getting us our look with the Royals.
Is that right?
Oh, well, thank your daddy for me.
It would be great if Chris could play ball nearby and be here to raise his little brother Taylor when I'm gone.
You're not going anywhere.
I've watched Chris play the game since he was little, and I've watched him grow into a fine young man.
He didn't have a lot growing up, but I did the best I could.
You did great.
And I always told him, if he worked hard, he could achieve whatever he wanted.
And one day, he'll go on and inspire a lot of kids to do the same.
(sobs)
- (chuckles)

I don't want to tire you out bragging about me all day.
But I like it.

(chuckles)
(sighs) Sweetheart.
- No way, I am not cutting Travis!

- $200,000 a year to the athletic department.

It is my team and I decide who's on the roster!
We are in the middle of a budget crisis!
- We need that money!

No, we won't.

Besides, Mike Chapman didn't even skip a beat.
- He wants Travis out!

Of course I did, but he knows Travis's history.

I see his point.
It's not fair to the rest of the athletes to suffer just because one kid can't control his temper!
I'm talking to Mike.
No, you're not and that's not open for discussion.
Oh, really?
I know how you feel about Travis.
He's the reason you're coaching in the first place, so... if you want me to be the one to tell him, I will.
No, it should be me.
Well, that's about it.
Okay, I'm just about finished up here, but I'm short a co-ax cable.

You cool with me being gone for a couple hours?
- No problem.

- I'll definitely finish tonight.

All right then.

Just sign right here.
It's gonna be okay.
I hope you're right.
I'm proud of you for doing this the right way.
This is good.
I'm sorry for getting you involved in all of this, but thank you.
I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything.

How's it coming?
All good.

- this afternoon and then we're all done.

I'm about halfway through the samples we've collected, just get the rest to me when you can.
Will do.

Anything unusual come up?
Nope, all clear.

- anyone's trying to game the test.

Well, you'd be surprised at the lengths some athletes would go to mask their results.
- Really?

You know, like a special diet, intense use of diuretics, but I have ways of finding all that.
- You do?

If I suspect any of that stuff's been done,
I'll just order a blood test.
That's conclusive.

That's really interesting.
It's a science.

(door unlocks, opens)
(door closes)
Toby, you back already?
Toby?
Toby, is that you?
(door opens)
I have a gun!
I'm calling 9-1-1!
Since when did you get a gun?
Oh my God!
Eric!
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
It wouldn't have been smart of me to contact you.
But where's Will?

We're fine.

Portland, Salt Lake, Boulder.
I almost broke down and called you a million times.
I wish you had.
- But why are you here now?

I'm tired of changing our identities, never settling down.
And it's not right for Will.
I mean, he's getting older, and he's asking me questions that I can't answer.

But if Hope finds you...
Hope's in jail, parole violation.
The police are still looking for me, but I found a guy.
He can help me and Will get out of the country.
It's not cheap, but he can give me everything that we need:
uh, new identities, citizenship, a business, everything... a whole new life.
So, why did you come back?
I left something here.
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
Travis, I'm sorry, but my hands are tied, and getting angry about it is not gonna help anything.
Uh, Travis, can I give you a little advice?
Whatever this is that is making you so angry, you have got to get to the bottom of that.
Otherwise, it is just gonna keep messing up your life.
Oh no.
Yeah, I led him to believe that he's gonna pass, and now he's gonna get caught for sure.
Everyone involved in the protest has moved on with their lives, but Chris made the biggest sacrifice of them all and now it's gonna cost him everything.
It does sound pretty unfair.
There is one thing I could do.
I'm in charge of all the drug test samples.
But it's wrong helping someone cheat, right?
Is it cheating to help someone who doesn't ever get a fair shake to begin with?
- What do you mean?

I know that, but am I crazy for thinking about crossing the line for him.
Maybe I'm the wrong person to ask.
When you're medical career was on the line,
I took the bullet for you.
I didn't even hesitate, and I would do it again in a second.
- Hi.

Hey, um, I'm Daphne.
I remember.

Um, I have to get back to the health center.

- It was nice to see you again.

Sorry to drop in like this, but I just...
I just don't know what happened last night.
I was so excited to finally reconnect with Travis, and we were having such a good time, and he just... shut down.
I don't know if it was something that
I said or something that I did.
I'm sorry.

There is something going on.
- It's just, it's really not my place.

I know that he has Melody, and I'm... (sobs) I'm happy, but I'm his mom.
I'm his real mom, and I missed all that time with him, and I'm...
I'm trying to make up for it.
I know my signing wasn't very good last night.

- so nervous.

Then will you... talk to him and ask him to tell me?
please, whatever it is...
I just want to know.
That's been in my daughter's apartment this whole time?
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't want to get you in trouble.
That is a lot of money.
This buys me and Will a new life.
I want it to include you.
Look, I've got a little cafe picked out in Belize.
I can't.
We could live the life we've always wanted.
Come with me.
(sighs) I can't.
Come... with me.
Wait.
Wait.
I can't do this.
I can't do this.
Your mom came to see me at the tattoo parlor.
Because. (sighs)
She knows that something's wrong, but she doesn't know what.
You said that she will be devastated if you tell her... but she is devastated right now.
Travis, you have to face this.
All this other stuff that you've been doing, it's not working anymore.
(sighs)
I'll come.
I'll interpret.
I will be with you the whole time.
(sighs)
Thanks.
(indistinct conversation)
Dr. Taylor.
You're gonna kill me.

I dropped one of the samples.

It's okay.

It's Friday, so have the nurse call the student whose sample was ruined and let them know they need to get in here first thing Monday for a re-screen.
Give Will a kiss for me.
Yeah.
Look, I wasn't just coming back for the money.
I had to try.
I know.
And once I'm gone, I can't come back.
I understand.
I hope you do too.

Eddie isn't gay.
He was married.
It's true.
Maybe you're remembering it wrong.
It was the Christmas during that big snow storm, and the power went out.
You went to the grocery store because all the food in the fridge went bad.
- And he took me into the garage.

Stop.

He's not making this up.
Then why didn't you tell me this years ago?
I couldn't tell you.

And how could you not notice how things changed between us whenever he was around?
I just thought you were being a... a teenager.
You never talked to me!
You were angry all of the time!
That's why I was angry.
Because you never learned my language.
(gasps) I've been trying.
It's too late.
I don't need it now.
I needed it when I was 12.
I was scared.
I thought it was all my fault.
I couldn't tell you... and Eddie knew that.
And that's why he took advantage of me, because I was the deaf kid who couldn't talk to his mom.
(Karen cries) I'm sorry!
(crying) I...

That's not good enough.
Please help me.
Please.
(sniffles)
I think what he needs to hear is that you believe him.
(sniffles)
I believe you.
I believe you.
I believe you!
(Travis cries)
I have to take the test again?

Your test was compromised.
They need you back in on Monday morning.
By compromised you mean...
I dropped it, accidentally.
But what about the cleanse?
I mean, everything we did?
- I thought...

You would've been flagged.
I couldn't let that happen to you.
And Monday will be seven days since I stopped.
I'll test clean!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Whoa, whoa.
That's not why I did this.
Do you have any idea how I feel right now, how hard that was for me to do?
Yeah, I do,
- and I really, really appreciate it.

Because I don't feel very good about myself right now.
I cheated in a hospital.
I want to be a doctor, that's my dream, and right now, I don't feel like I deserve to be one.
Hey.
Hey, you helped somebody who desperately needed it, even though it could have cost you everything.
That kind of doctor...
That's the kind of doctor I want.
(whispers) Thank you.
Just make sure you end up being the guy your Aunt Mae sees when she looks at you.
I promise...
I will.
- Hey.

Well, you're all set.
James Bond couldn't break in here without everyone knowing it.

This is so cool.
So, it automatically takes a screen grab every five seconds and saves it to your hard drive.
Now if you want to go full screen, click on the cam that you want to see and scroll through the images like this.
- (computer beeps)

Oh.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
If nothing happened between us, and there's no chance it ever will, do I need to tell Luca he was here?
You know, when Lily told me about Julian... it almost ruined us.
And in the end, there was nothing there.
Honestly, I kind of wish that... she had never told me.
I think some things in life are just better left unsaid.
Thanks. (sighs)
Now, can you show me how to delete this?
(chuckles)
I am so proud of you.
So do you think that things will be easier between you and your mom?
Yeah, I know.
But, hey,
Regina missed the first 16 years of my life, and look at us now.
You can rebuild.
(door opens, closes)
Hey.
Uh, you know what?

So I, uh...
I called a friend of mine from the Royals days.

Well, they need a relief pitcher with a really good curve.
So, I sent them a video of you.
And it turns out... they're interested.
(chuckles) Yeah.
Yeah, but no, there's just one thing, okay?
The team is in Tokyo.
It's the Japanese league.
Yeah.
And, uh, they need you pitching... in a week.
