Previously on "Shooter"...
- That's six shots. 1,500 yards.

- Lon Scott.

If we don't start working together...
Together?
I know you're onto Lon Scott, and you are going to need help.
Just because you realized you're expendable doesn't make us partners.
It doesn't mean we don't need to be.
- I need a path out.

Get the thumb drive.

God, you're a dumb-ass.
The thumb drive?
They hired Swagger to kill us.
Now he's gonna kill them instead.
You arranged this with Swagger?
Worth the risk in order to get my shot at him.
For years, I wanted to be as good as you, but... we both know I'm better now.
I'm the sniper.
You're just a... marksman.
You could be implicated, too, Lon.
Anhur is all over that thumb drive.
- You know Swagger's here, right?

- Why?

Now I'm gonna finish it.
- Swagger still lives.

I don't like the unknown.
Then get out of the espionage business.
Perhaps we'll dig a hole for you, Mr. Meachum.
Swagger's gone.

Our mutual friends will not be pleased.
Good-bye, Mr. Meachum.
Hey, you remember the old Ranger station?
Are we in trouble?
I need you and Mary to get there as soon as you can.

Yes, definitely.

You've always covered for me.
I need you to do it this one last time.
Can I speak to Julie?

You've got one second to get your foot out of my door
- before I break it.

Julie Swagger's gone.
I'll have someone there within the hour.
Mama needs you underneath the bed, all right?
You can't come out until Mama comes back for you.
- Okay?

Hey!
Okay.
Howard says we should report them officially kidnapped, and the FBI can start a coordinated operation and find them.
No.
You're underestimating the bureau.
What am I supposed to say when he calls back?
I said no, God damn it!
I want to find them, too, but we have no chance without help.
We do if we strike first.
You're asking me to violate my oath again.
I'm not asking you to do anything.
- The door's right there.

Nothing comes before my family!
Not the law, not your conscience, not your case.
You can't save your family by killing everyone that stands between you and them.
Maybe, maybe not.
Who are you calling?
The asshole who started this.
Hello?
We can meet, or I can hunt you down.
All right.

- I'll come alone.

Just be there.
Bob Lee?
It's Swagger.

- You should get going.

You didn't really want to be a part of this anyway.

I don't know why you brought this asshole back.
Eat my dick.
Jack, despite his manners, is a value to me.
Especially now.
Don't keep Swagger waiting.
You won't regret giving me a second chance, Lon.
Just focus.

Mrs. Swagger, you're even more beautiful in person than you are on TV.
- And you are?

- As long as you play nice.

Hey, where the hell is Meachum?
He's alive.
Yes, but he won't be for long.
He crossed one bridge too far.
Good-bye, Mr. Meachum.
I know you wanted to meet a few hundred yards away.
But that rifle you're carrying tells me it's wise to stop you here.
This needs to end peacefully.
Peace stopped being an option when you put hands on my family.
That wasn't me.

Drop your weapon.
You trained her well.
Where is my family?
What'd I teach you?
Take your emotions out of it.
If I was being led by my emotions, you'd be a pile of red dirt right now.
It's Mary and Julie for the thumb drive
- and the diamonds.

You'll give us your word that everything will go smoothly?
I know my word doesn't mean shit to you...
But they want what they want, and they're willing to do whatever it takes.
They're not fucking around.

And what do you get out of it?
- I disappear.

All this for money?
All this so my wife and I can make it to safety and build a new life.

Annex B for your family.
Do you understand?
There's no other play.
Fine, but you play for my team until this is over.
Agreed.
♪ If Daddy had to run ♪
♪ If he had to crawl ♪
♪ If he had to swim 100 rivers ♪
♪ Just to climb 1,000 walls ♪
♪ Always know that he would find a way ♪
♪ To get to where you are ♪
That was beautiful.
Don't stop because of me.
I can't wait for him to get his hands on you.
Yeah, well... been there, done that, and I'm still standing.
Well, I'm sitting, but...
- Mommy, I'm scared.

I'm right here.
You're not the one who should be scared.
Hold it.
How did our friend take the news?
Meachum is no longer my problem.
He failed us one too many times.
That seemed inevitable.
Are you my problem, Lon?
You mean because you hired Swagger to kill me for $10 million?

My understanding is, you made the same deal.
When you want to kill a wolf, sometimes you need some sheep.
Was disarming me really necessary?
I don't trust you.
- You spoke to Swagger.

I'd stay away from any windows.
- He's outside right now?

And he has Special Agent Memphis with him.
I don't care who's with him.
Is he willing to give us Annex B?
As soon as his family is free, yes.
Evidence first, then family.
We are holding all the cards.
Swagger doesn't care about the computer file.
He cares about being double-crossed, and we haven't given him a reason to trust us.
If he was worried about trust, we'd already be dead.
Set up the deal.
He's gonna want to know that his family's alive.
Looks like we have a deal.
That's the first good thing I've heard all day.
He has us scoped right now, doesn't he?
Yep.
I can feel it.
My God, it's exhilarating.
Lon, it's really not.
Isaac would be first.
He's smart under fire, calm.
Krukov would be next.
He's FSB, so he's well-trained.
Lon Scott would be last.
He's got good instincts, but he has no idea what to do when the target fires back.
He'll freeze up and I'd smoke him.
He won't do it, even though he's dying to.
Bob Lee.
Think about Julie and Mary.
You start shooting, they'll kill them.
Bang.
Bang.
Bang.
Bullet is forever.
You tell me to meet you here, then you make me wait?
Gotta to make sure you weren't followed.
You chose to hole up in an FBI front company, and you're worried about me compromising security?
Look around.

Enough.

Call this number.
Let me call it in.
Calling the FBI is not a part of the plan.
You're not dictating the terms.
Hey, it's Memphis.
Yeah, let me get a trace on a number.
Okay, thanks.
804-026-1378.
Okay, we got it.
Bob Lee, I've missed you.
Put my wife on the phone.
Well, you could at least ask me politely.
Put my wife on the phone now.
Honey, it's for you.
- Bob Lee?

Baby, I'm so sorry.

- We were...

You didn't do anything wrong.

Yeah, of course.

She'll be better when she gets to see you.
Let me talk to her.
Okay, hold on.

Daddy...
Where are you?
I miss you so much, kitten-mouse.
I'm gonna see you real soon.
When?
Tonight.

Remember, Daddy loves you both so much.
- We love you too.

Daddy!
Mary?

All right, so, you got what you wanted.
Put my wife back on the phone.
We'll send further instructions.
It's okay.

Daddy's gonna come for us.

Did you get it?
Okay.

83 Bowan Road, Arlington, Virginia.
It's in an industrial park owned by Anher.
All right.

You're jeopardizing everything.
- We have a deal.

You really think they're gonna let you walk away with the diamonds after I'm dead?
You think I'm getting too emotional.
They don't trust you.
Hell, they probably don't even like you.
One way or another, this ends in blood.
Look, all I want to do is get as far away from here as I can and never come back.
If you just gave me what I want, I'd be on my way.
I'm not giving you shit!
You lit the fuse when you drove down my driveway and you're gonna see it through to the end.
That's true, but I don't see a way we walk out of this alive.
I get my wife and daughter back.
She gets the evidence.
Then, you can fuck off with your diamonds.
They're never gonna let that happen.
Look at it this way, Isaac.
What choice do you have?
Did things go as expected?
Yeah, he took the bait.
I'm sure he got a trace on the call.
He'll be coming for his family.
How soon do you think we can expect Swagger?
My guess is, they should be here within the hour.
You want me to stick with the plan?
Yeah.

Make sure we lead him to the right room.
Copy that.

I need you to get all of this.
MP-5s, pistol ammo, rifle ammo, thermal scope.
A 50 cal?
If I sign out this much firepower, it's gonna raise eyebrows.
I don't care.

We'll pick it up at the armory on the way.
Okay.

You can scope out from across the street.
Julie and Mary will be on a floor that's got heavy security.
Wouldn't it be smarter to put me on overwatch?
I want you where I can see you.
So you want me to provide overwatch?
No, that would give up your position.
I need you to guide me to family and keep up an eye out for any surprises headed our way.
Okay, what about what she can't see?
What do you think I'm bringing you for?
Are you going somewhere?
Have a drink, Grigory.

I will have a drink when this business is over.
And since we're now partners,
I think it's not out of the question for me to want to know what you are planning.
You're not my partner, and I suggest you show a little more gratitude for the hospitality
I've shown you.
I am very grateful, but as you guessed,
I must confess that I will be much more comfortable if you would allow me to send some of my people along with you to assist.
So you can get your hands on your precious Annex B?
That's fine.
Tell them they're under my command.
But Swagger's mine, so make sure they stay out of my way.
Of course.
Just remember, we did not start this as a way for you to prove you are as good as Swagger.
This is about the map of the world.
I'm better than Swagger.

Only seeing one guard on your side of the building.
He's approaching the door.
Then, it's all clear on this side.
Okay, copy that.

Copy that.
She knows how this is gonna go down?
She knows what I am.
Oh!
How we looking on that side?
You're clear past the next two landings.
One guard at a back door holding two high-value assets?

They're not assets.

And if they're in here, we're gonna get them.
And if they're not?
Then a lot of people are gonna die for no reason.
No heat signatures on this level.
Keep moving up.
I've got thermals on the next level.
Left corridor.
Straight ahead. 30 yards.
We're in.
I see several armed guards on the other side of the building, top floor.
- Any sign of Julie or Mary?

They're too close together.
Okay.

Cut that front.
Don't be careless.

They're moving.
- Moving where?

Towards the west exit.
They're moving Julie and Mary, let's go.
Okay, I can make out ten guards, but I don't see your family.
Copy.
We need to take one of them alive,
- find out where they are.

No, he's mine.
I wanted him alive!
That wasn't me.
Payne set us up.
Julie and Mary were never here.
They lured us in here so Lon Scott can get a clear line of sight.
What's going on?
Lon Scott's set up on us.
- You got to move.

I'll get out of sight and guide you guys out.
I see you.
All right.
Wave me over.

There you go.
Son of a bitch.
- Clear.

My men tell me Swagger still lives.
I would've had Swagger if one of your men hadn't gotten in my way.
Your obsession with Swagger has clouded your judgment.
I'm starting to wonder who I've more to fear from, him or you.
I think you should leave.
I think you are probably correct.
Thank you for your hospitality, Mr. Scott.
Any time.
Someone gonna say something?
- Leave it alone.

Not to sound like a broken record, but there's no reason not to call in the bureau.
- I can think of a few reasons.

I care about saving Bob Lee's family.
Then you should know the second Lon Scott gets wind this thing has gone federal, he'll disappear, and what do you think happens to Julie and Mary then?
It's not your call.
Isaac's right.
If the feds get involved, I'll never see my family again.
I've got a different idea.
Sorry about your lunch choices.
I'm not much of a cook.
How do you expect us to eat those with our hands tied behinds our backs?
They told me to bring you food.
That's food.
- Mommy...

Lon Scott is out of control.
Oh, yeah?

You really want your fate tied to such a man?
Look, if you'd have just paid me, you wouldn't be in this jam.

Lon has a score to settle, and I'm not crossing it.
You have already crossed it.
Yeah, and he let me back in.
So I'm gonna be a good little soldier from this point on.
I'm glad to hear it, but even the most loyal soldier needs someone to cover his flank.
Even you must realize you're expendable.
- Tell Lon Scott I'm here.

Sir, Bob Lee Swagger's here at the gate.
He wants him brought inside.
Do you guys all have the same tailor?
Where do you hide the protection?
Shut up.
You're wearing Kevlar, right?
Keep walking.
Just answer one question.
Is it that Kevlar level 3A, the good shit?
You know who I am?
Tell Mr. Scott I'll be in his office.
I know the way.
Is my family alive?
It's never been my intent to harm them.
Are you here to kill me?
I don't talk about killing, Lon.
I just do it.
I'm clearly more than just talk as well.
You saw what I did to the Ukrainian president.
Too bad everyone thinks the U.S. president was the target.
Hey, congratulations on making the most-famous missed shot in history.
I'm planning an even longer shot, one that will be a world record.
Oh, yeah?

Well, my daddy's money didn't give me ability.
You of all people should know that.
Oh, come on, man.
The Black King, your special bullets...
I could hand you a Stradivarius.
Doesn't mean you'd play like Paganini.
I don't speak trust fund.
I'll ask again.
Is my family alive?
Reaching for my phone.
You could've recorded that at any time.
Speak to them.
- Hello?

Bob Lee, hey...
- Is that Daddy?

Can you see us?
- Yeah, yeah.

I'm right there with you, Julie.
- Believe me.

- Daddy...

Uh.
Where are they?
They're safe, and they'll remain safe.
That's disappointing.
This isn't a game, man!
It's my family!
You let them go,
I'll give you that shot you've been hoping for.
I swear.
Once I know they're safe, I'll stand there and let you pop rounds off all day.
You in or not?

Be at the Great Meadow Golf Course, one hour.
If you bring the evidence, you have my word I'll release your family.
You don't give a shit about the evidence.
You're right.

I never have.
You can leave the way you came in.
He'll be here.
He never could follow orders.
You want to leave?

You know, if Bob Lee can learn to work with me, you can too.
I wouldn't take his lack of hostility as trust.
All right, ladies, cheer up.
We're going to see your daddy.
Really?
Oh, honey,
I would never lie to you about something like that.
- You make a deal?

But it's the only chance of saving Julie and Mary.
The exchange is gonna go down at the Great Meadow Golf Course.
We gotta move.
We're gonna need the 50 cal.
Lon Scott wants to take me out with a long shot.
With his skill, he could be shooting from almost any distance with a line of sight.
Don't worry about saving me.
Just make sure Julie and Mary get away safe.
Hey, if something happens to me...
- Hello?

Yeah, but I just want to make sure you realize that if you do this,
Lon's coming after you next.
Just focus on getting that evidence and escaping without getting killed.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I figured out a way to make sure I stay alive.
_
_
Lon could be set up at any number of possible positions.
He's not near us.
What we're looking at is over 2,000 yards away.
We'd have a hard time seeing him if he was out in the open.
You can make a shot that far?
No.
You know what?

It's the only way in.

- I have eyes on an SUV.

No, I can't make out anyone inside.
Something's up.

What the hell is happening?
I don't have a clear view.
It seems like some sort of transfer.
Whatever it is, I don't like it.
Okay, the van's pulling away.
I'm gonna follow the SUV.
No, I need you here.
I have to go.
Damn it.
_
So your husband thinks he's a real bad-ass, huh?
He practically walks on water?
- What'd you do with Mary?

Your husband's gonna die today, Julie.
No, no, no.

What do you think?
Do you like it?
It was the best I could do on such short notice.
I was gonna use the tape on your head, but I didn't want to mess up your pretty hair.
Okay.

Keep your mouth shut.
Where's my daughter?
- Where's the evidence?

Hey, you may want to back up there, Bob, before it gets messy.

If I fall, my weight will pull the trigger, and I'm pretty sure it will decapitate her.
Shit.
Okay.

Well, she's a hell of a lot safer than she would be here.
Trust me.
Hey, come on, man.
You had to know you wouldn't live past this moment, right?
Son of a bitch.
Go.
Bob Lee, go, please.
Baby, it's gonna be okay.
You got to trust me.
Well, we both know he's got you bracketed now.
I want your last thought to be about what I'm gonna do to her after you're gone.
Go, go!

Go find Mary.

You've got to trust me.
I guess he found my bullet.
What the hell are you doing?
I got it.

Here.

Let me do it.
Aah!
I'm only gonna ask you this once.
Where the hell is my daughter?
You'll never shoot.
You're a housewife.
I'm a Swagger.
We have to find Mary.

Some man took her from the back of the... a van a few minutes ago.
- Look, we have to get her.

- We have to.

- No, no.

If we lose our heads, we lose everything.
No, listen, listen, you don't... you don't know where she is.

What's going on?

- You do that, they'll kill her.

- Sweetheart, he's with me.

- It's complicated, honey.

- It's complicated.

That is the asshole who started all of this.
And I'm the asshole who's gonna help end it.
We got to clear this location now.
No, I don't trust him.

You don't have to trust him.

If I didn't think he could help us get Mary back, he wouldn't be here.
- Hello?

Someone took Mary.
I know.

I followed them, but...
I've gone as far as I can go.
What do you mean, "As far as you can go"?
You lost them?
No.

Where are they?
_
She's in Russia.
