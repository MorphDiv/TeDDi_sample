Philanthropist.
People pay for all sorts of things on the Deep Web.
I'm keeping custody of Jacob.
But I lifted the restraining order.
Sometimes people keep trying until they get it right.
Why didn't you marry my dad?
I don't want to talk about it.
Jacob.
Hi, Dad.
Holy shit.
She said to please let him go.
I will get my son.
My attorney will be in touch.
I need you to kill Sean.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Because I am thinking about what you just asked me to do.
Are you thinking about what you just asked me to do?
I don't think you meant to ask it.
I did.
You really want me to kill Sean.
I need you to kill Sean.
Jacob's father.
No, I want you to kill a person, which is nothing new for you.
These are words I never imagined you would say.
And I never imagined that the man who ruined me would come back and try to ruin me again.
I never imagined he would try to ruin Jacob.
Actually, I have imagined it like a million times, because it's my worst nightmare.
And now he wants custody and he has a lawyer.
I'm sorry.
Of course, I could never understand what you went through with Sean.
Obviously, it was horrible, what he did to you.
So you wouldn't have kept Jacob a secret unless there was a very good reason.
Exactly.
And that man cannot take Jacob.
Do you understand?
I understand.

I am not here to fight.

So what happened between you and Letty?
She didn't tell you?
No, not really.
Letty and I had something...

But she doesn't take responsibility for the choices she makes, and when shit turns bad, she turns blame on whatever's close by.

Junkies abandon themselves.
You didn't do drugs.
I didn't even know that Jacob existed until two weeks ago.
I know that.
Well, I'm back from the dead.
Thank you.
So... how do you really know if you want to be a father to Jacob?
How do I know if I want to be a father to my own son?
You've only known Jacob for two weeks, so you don't know him.
I've spent more time with him than you have.
And that's the problem.
Why is that a problem?
You're not his real father.
I care about what happens to him.

That's a great idea.
I have never seen Letty more destroyed than she is right now.
You terrified her.
Leave her alone.
Leave Jacob alone.
Are you kidding me with this?
Jacob's an amazing kid because he was raised by people who cared about him.
And now you just want to take him away from those people...
His grandmother, his mother.
So you just want to win.
Of course I want to win, but I choose my battles carefully.

I would hope your conversation with Jacob granted you some insight into how important Ms. Raines is to her son.
I appreciate all of your points of view.
I know that you love Jacob.
I know that you love Jacob, but there are a few details that complicate this matter.
Though it is noted that Ms. Raines was released from her sentence early, it is also worth noting that Mr. Barron, while not a part of Jacob's life until recently, may be the more natural parent in this case.
In my observation, Jacob may benefit from a primary caretaker with whom he shares a common culture.
What does that mean? "A common culture."
I believe, honey, she's saying something along the lines of
Blacks should stay together.
She's saying Jacob needs a parent who understands what it means to be black.
It could be very good for Jacob to spend more time with someone who has a personal understanding of his heritage, where he came from.
You mean my vagina, because that's where he came from.
My client is understandably emotional, Ms. Shane.
Are you really making custody recommendations based on something as superficial as the child's skin tone?
I beg your pardon, but racial identity is far from superficial.
You might want to rethink going down...
I'm sorry.
I understand that Sean is his father, clearly, but I'm his mother.
And seeing how I was robbed of the opportunity before,
I deserve a chance to be his father.
I think Mr. Barron makes a good point.
He's kind and he's soft-spoken.
Competition and all that male bullshit make him anxious.
He's smart, but he's fragile.
Jacob knows that.
My mother...
My mother has done an amazing job raising him.
But now Jacob needs to know that his own mother can take care of him, that his own mother wants him, that his own mother gets him.
I get him because he's just like me.
And those ingredients we're made of aren't typical.
They're hard to understand, but they're intuitive to me.
I'm not trying to win an argument.
I love him and I want to be his mother.
Please, let me be his mom.
I will pass my recommendations along to the family court, and a judge will make a ruling by end of day Monday.
Until that decision is made,
Jacob will remain in his grandmother's custody.
