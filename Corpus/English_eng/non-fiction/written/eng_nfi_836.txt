I thought we were friends.
And then, you slept with my husband.
What you did was unforgivable!
I would have scratched your bloody eyes out.
Oh, Martha.

There was a man was chasing her.
- Elena, where is she?

Help!

MAN:

- I said some dreadful things.

Take good care of her.
We always do.
Here you are, Mrs Ranovic.
Thank you.
Patty!
I know it's real and I have to believe it, but I just can't, because...
Because she should still be here.
Yeah.
I just keep expecting her to burst through the door with her big Patty smile.
Now, where was I?
Seven pounds.
She's lost weight.
What do babies do in the first few days?
Lose weight.
Exactly.
Are you sure you're okay to go home?
You need the beds.
After everything that's happened, I think I just...
I need to be at home.
And if I don't start looking after you, how will I get to know you?
Yours looks as new as mine.
Doesn't she, Amy?
Amy.

I've always loved it.
- She's beautiful.

What's her name?
Haven't decided yet.
I'm waiting for her to tell me who she really is.
♪ You think that I don't feel love ♪
♪ What I feel for you is real love ♪
♪ And other times, I see reflected ♪
♪ A hurt, scorn, rejected love child ♪
♪ Different from the rest. ♪
I've got a hole in my theatre roster this afternoon.
- Can you come in and fill it?

- Okay, tomorrow?

Can't you just sling it over your shoulder or...?
- She's not an "it".

- And I'll be back soon enough.

Smoothed it over with the board, did you?
Let's just say, I've laid the groundwork.
- And with your support...

Doctor?
- How are you at repairing fistulas?

Good.

Hi.

The police reckon Patty must have slipped and fell, hit her head.
It makes no sense.
What's in the box?
Oh, Patty's stuff.
Liz dropped it off from the crèche.
(BABY CRIES)
I think that's my cue.
If you need help with that?
Discharge forms?
All 6.000 of them.
- Never seen so many babies.

God, if you're listening,
I pray your light shine down on young Patricia, whose time came too soon.
We'll miss you, Patty.

Amen.
Bless Patty and welcome her into your loving arms.
Bless Elena, so far away from her home.
And thank you, Father, for the miracle you've bestowed upon me.
I've told you to take that thing off.
I will not stand for a stupid, little girl with the morals of a cat, claiming that God impregnated her!
Now, take it off!
And you can stop filling Elena's head with all that nonsense, because I suspect there's more than enough in there already.
And as for you, you should be dressed and ready by now.
In fact, you all should have been in there and mending, 15 minutes ago!
I was studying.
Don't you want me to get an education?
Not in my time.
Moving, now!
That was a complex case.
Rubbish.

Going to have to start looking over my shoulder.
You'll be after my job soon.
Hey.
Hey.

- That's good, Simon.

Yeah.

Do you even care that Patty's dead?
I was thinking, I'll take you out for dinner tonight.

I'm not exactly in the mood to celebrate.
Um, I...
I'm sorry.
Oh.
I hear Joan Millar's been discharged already.
- I hope everything was in order?

Where's her discharge papers?
Vivian did get her to sign them, didn't she?
- It's been really busy.

There's a procedure with every baby and every mother.
And if we just let mothers walk out without signing everything, then...
- Can't Joan just sign it later?

But... yes, it has been a difficult couple of days... for everyone.
To go like that.
Silly, clumsy girl.
No need to worry about Dr Millar's papers.
- I'll deal with it.

No education and definitely no sex, because sex is dirty.
Dirty, dirty.
And sex is why slutty little girls like you, end up locked up in this jail with a dried-up old virgin like me!
Do you understand?
Do you?

Debbie, don't.
Oh, no, Elena.

I was just joking.
It's me.
Patty's dead because she helped me.
I make this happen to her.
No, you didn't.

I'm cursed.
Patty, my famiglia, my brother, my shame has cursed them all.
Elena, what if it was your brother that killed Patty?
- Debbie!

Elena already said how angry he was and we all know what Italians are like.
He can't get to Elena in here, so he follows Patty home and maybe he's so angry that he pushed her or he held her head under the water or...
- Debbie, don't!

I was just saying that it's not Elena's fault.
It's her brother's.
This is mostly stuff from crèche.
Receipts and things like that.
What is it?
Did you know that Patty was meeting guys from the personal columns?
Why would she do that?
Patty was beautiful.
She could go out with anyone.
Listen.
"I want to meet men I don't know.
I don't want to meet anyone who might be a boyfriend or a fiancé or husband of someone I know.
I don't ever want another chance to prove what an awful person I can be."
Look at this.
"Saturday, 10 June.

You look through this,
- I'll look through these.

- A name, a number, anything.

It was the day she died!
What I don't get is that if the Virgin Mary got to have sex with the Holy Spirit, how come you got to do it with God?
Why do you say things like that?
You know, we should sell tickets for when you push it out.
Line up!

Quick, Elena!

Come on!
(SPEAKS ITALIAN)
Hey, leave her alone!

- Help!

- Don't!

- What is going on here?

You let go of her!
Hey!

He's the killer!

He's a murderer!
- (SPEAKS HARSHLY IN ITALIAN)

- You are nothing.

The police may well have cleared you, but I warned you, Mr Capobianco.
This is a hospital.

Elena is my sister.

Sit down.
You lied to me about why she's here.
Just a lie, eh?
Thank you, Dr Patterson.
I'll take it from here.
It's all right.
Now that you know the truth, isn't it preferable that she stays?
You can have Elena with tuberculosis, in which case you can tell the family in six or seven months that she's cured and is now ready to marry the man that she's been promised to, or you can have her pregnant.
So, what's it to be?
Tuberculosis?
Si.
Good.

One, last matter.
As you can imagine, caring for these girls does not come cheaply.
You want me to pay?
I prefer the word "donate".
Matron?
About what Debbie said about Elena's brother.
We've had the police do a check.
Whatever his other many faults, he's not a murderer.
But even if it's not him, do you think maybe the police could be wrong,
- that it wasn't just an accident?

Martha, we all want answers in life.
But for our own sake, sometimes, we have to accept that there are none.
Do you understand?
I suppose.
Good girl.
It was mixed up with all those receipts.

It starts with 'C', like in the diary.

Okay, even if it is him, it doesn't mean anything.
- That's what the police said.

- They wouldn't listen.

Patty meets a strange bloke in a bar and a couple of hours later, she's dead.

- Not us, the police.

They don't think she's important.
But they're wrong.

And I think someone did something to her.
Oh, you're not serious?
Can you really stand there and tell me that
Patty's death makes sense to you?
That doesn't mean that she was murdered.
What if she was?
We have to find out!
We're nearly there, sweet pea.
What about "sweet pea" for a name, hm?
No?

I wonder what name daddy would like?
At least your brother promised to leave you here.
That's good, isn't it?
I have shamed my famiglia.
I only bring shame to everyone.
Hey, it's no big deal.
We've all done that.

Elena, they'll get over it.
No.
No, never.
- My family is gone.

Everything's going to work out.
Honestly, it is.
Would it help if I prayed for you?
Simon.

- I should have said so.

Suggesting dinner was stupid, you know, stupid idea.
I know you're going through some...
It's okay.

Matron's sprung a last-minute admin course we need to go to.
Okay.

Well, I don't know how long it's going to last.
I'll just get a lift or a taxi.
I think that's easier.
I won't be home too late.
- Love you.

♪ Most people I know, think that I'm crazy... ♪
I think they're my favourite band, right now.
Oh, yeah.

- BOTH: ♪ And you should know it... ♪

Yeah.
(MUSIC STOPS)
Oh... yeah.
Tonight, I'm probably going to go listen to some, ah, half-baked R  B that's only out to draw the Gis, so.
- That is my night.

Yeah, Martha's on some course.
Excellent.
You can hit the town with me.

You and me?
Sure.
- Are you in?

Could be.
So, it's just you and me, little one.
Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm going to be here forever.
And I'm never going to let anything bad happen to you.
(KNOCKING)
- Hi.

No, no, come in.
I just wanted to bring you these.

Vivian forgot to ask you to sign them before you left.
Oh, no, that's not her fault.
I should have remembered.
I'm sure you had other things on your mind.
I took the liberty of filling them out for you.
- We just need a signature.

- Oh, yes, let me.

You've done that before.
Quite a few times.
Just there.

And the other page.
Settled on a name yet?
Nothing's come to me.
Don't leave it too long.

Helps them bond with their mother.
She has beautiful features.
From her father?
Yes, she's definitely Daddy's girl.
- I'll leave you to it.

Goodbye.

Hello, can I please speak to Jim Marsh?
Are you sure?
Did he leave a forwarding address?
Thanks.
(BABY CRIES)
Sh.
It's all right.
It's all right, Mummy's here.
Mummy's here.
Sh, it's okay.
Hey.

Does that happen to you a lot, girls trying to pick you up?
Are you kidding?

See that one, the blonde?
She couldn't take her eyes off you.
- Me?

I don't think I can do this.
If you don't, then he gets away with it.
Well, then, you do it.
You told him you were blonde.
Look, all we have to do is get his driver's licence, so that we can see if it's his real name and address.
Then, we can go back to the police with proof.
Oh!

So?
Plus, she is a man.
Name's Viv, right?
Yeah, hi.
- Craig.

Shall we sit?
Yeah, good idea.
Well, I'm the luckiest bloke in the room.
Oh, thanks.

Why, thank you.
So, now that we're both here, how about telling me a bit about yourself?
Stockbroker, advertising...

- Am I warm?

You look like a Harvey Wallbanger kind of girl.
I don't know.

Do you want something?
No, you just look like someone I know.
Hey, mate.

So, what do you reckon?

- Uh...

Come on, let's just at least, you know, check out what is on offer.
- Am I boring you?

- I've never done this before.

I'm not going to bite.
My friend Patty swears that it's a great way to meet guys.
And, in fact, she gave me your number.
Said that you went out, a couple of nights ago.
Hey, why don't we get out of here?
You know, find somewhere private.
Sure, okay.
Oh!

- It's all right.

- Oi!

♪ Wanna tell you, she's out of sight ♪
♪ Loves me in the morning ♪
♪ Loves me late at night. ♪
- His name's not Craig.

Oh, God, Martha.

Hey!
No, no, no, the truth.
It's just a bit of, you know, dancing...
Martha?
- Give me back my wallet!

What the hell do you think you're doing?
Did my wife put you up to this?
- Your wife?

- You killed Patty, didn't you, Keith?

- You killed her!

- Martha!

- See if they believe you!

I'll tell 'em you're a couple of bloody pickpockets.
All right, mate.

Martha, give the man back his wallet.
No way, it's evidence!
You're acting crazy and you need to stop it!
Give it to him!
I'm sorry about this, mate.

Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, how long are you going to keep this up?
You went to a strip club without telling me.
- I didn't!

Oh, but I suppose it's okay, you lied about going on that course?
I needed to find out what happened to Patty!
By putting yourself in danger!
Martha.

You and I, working together.
Couldn't you have at least talked to me about it?
Patty's family is coming tomorrow to take her back to Melbourne.
Meanwhile, she's still lying in a morgue and not you, not the police, not anybody gives a damn about what happened to her.
Debbie.

Elena's gone.
Half her luck.
No, you have to wake up.

- Oh.

Maybe she's run away.
She'd never leave this here, ever.
- She hasn't just run away.

Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.
I'm telling Matron.
The silly girl's probably just hiding somewhere.
Elena!

What if we're too late?
Will you calm down.

Oh, no.
- No!

Come on, hurry!
- Elena, no!

God loves you, but if you jump, it's a mortal sin.
Shut up.
Elena, please.
We're all here for you.
I bring shame.
Yeah, me too.
But, you know, that's why we've got to stick together, to spread it around a bit.
No, no, no, no, no.

My family is gone.
No, it isn't, Elena.
Because we're your family now and we need you.
Elena, please don't leave me here with church mouse and Matron.
Please, Elena?
Elena?
Elena, there's no way I can get through this without you!
Please, Elena!
Please, Elena.
No bloody way.
It's all right.
Good girls.

Patty, I know you're not here.
But I have to tell you...
I need to tell you...
Hey...
You can't go to Melbourne looking like this.
You're keen.

I can't quite put my finger on it, but she's not responding like she should be.
She was unsettled all night.
Look, she's a newborn.
They eat, they poop, they cry and they sleep.
- That is all that they do.

- I'll have someone else examine her.

Bring her through.

You never told me you had to remake my wedding dress.
Well, I didn't want you to worry on your special day.
You really worked on it all night?
What was I meant to do?

Martha.
Bit of a stuff-up last night, hey?
Just because it wasn't him, it doesn't mean it wasn't someone else.
What if it was like they think?
It could've been an accident, couldn't it?
- I'd better keep moving.

Excuse me.

I'm a friend of Patty's, who ran the crèche.
- Yeah, heard about that.

I know you were at the crèche the day Patty died, and if you saw something?
- Why would I?

It could be someone behaving strangely, or you saw Patty later that night?
- No, sorry.

No, you don't.
She's dead, it happened, get over it.
You want to label this for me?
Get them to check the BSL.
Yes, Doctor.
She's getting even cuter.
Just the blood sugar?

I can get them to check for dengue fever, if that's what you really want.
But at the moment, she looks like a pretty healthy baby to me.
- All right.

Let's just wait until we get the BSL and take it one step at a time.

And, as for you, you need to make sure you're getting enough sleep.
Does the baby's father help out?
No, we're not in contact.
In the meantime, just try not to worry.
Have a stiff drink or two.
Might help the both of you to get to sleep.
Viv, if Matron asks, can you cover for me?
I guess so.

Mandy, that prostitute?
I think she's hiding something.
I mentioned Patty and she just shut me right out.
And she's got that bruise.
But none of that means that she knows anything.
She does.

I have to talk to her.

Martha, it won't bring Patty back.
I know that.

Have you seen Mandy?

Excuse me, have you seen Mandy?
Hi, I'm looking for Mandy.
Long, wavy brown hair.
She was around here a couple of hours ago.

You don't know where she might have gone?
She could be shagging the Prime Minister, for all I know, love.
Baby Millar.

Joan was just a bit anxious.
First day home with her baby, you know, new mothers.
Dr Patterson's doing bloods?
I think he just wanted to put her mind at ease.
Nothing else Dr Millar was concerned about?
- No.

Viv, have you seen Martha?
She's not in Admin and I can't find her anywhere.
Uh, well...
She seems to have this thing about Patty.
I don't know, maybe I'm worrying about nothing.
No, you're not.
Mandy!
Are you all right?
- Husbands, eh?

He a pimp?
Mandy, I have to know, only for me, but I need to know, is there anything you can tell me about Patty?
Patty.
Come on!
She was only trying to help me.
Come here.
- A useless...

- Oh, gosh!

Leave her alone!
It's none of your business!
So, it was just an accident?
She was only trying to help.
Martha!
What's wrong?
Patty was a good person.
Better than anyone knows.
- Yeah.

I should have told her, but I didn't.
Oh, no, sweetie.

It's all right.
Ow!

- And they reckon having a baby hurts.

- Oh!

Oh, you win.

- Finito.

- You look beautiful, Debbie.

You know, you've always had God in common with Rita.
But now, you've got something in common with me.
We both look like wogs.
The thing about me and Martha is that no matter how angry she get or how many fights we have, I know that we'll be fine.
She'll forgive me for what I did and I'll forgive her for whatever she does next.
That's just how it'll always be for us, because we're friends for life.
Nothing's going to change that.
Patty, you lifted us up.
You were a good person.
But more importantly, you were a good friend... the best.
And, Viv, are you ever going to open that champagne?
To our beautiful friend.
♪ I would give anything I own ♪
♪ Give up my life, my heart, my home ♪
♪ I would give everything I own ♪
♪ Just to have you back again. ♪
Joan wants her job.
But that's absurd, she's a new mother.
Well, she thinks she can do it.
Maybe she can.
It's ridiculous what you're doing.
That child should be at home and you should be there with her, not using my staff as babysitters.
We play to win, sweetheart.
Don't call me sweetheart.
BOTH:

You stole those car keys.
I borrowed them.
Ohh!
You need to decide if you wanted to be a nurse or a stripper!
I've been groped, I've been put down!
