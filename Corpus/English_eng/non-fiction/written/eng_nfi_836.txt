This vessel... it's been warded with spellwork from the cage.
I own you.
I think I have a lead on Kelly Kline.
She's with Dagon, prince of hell, in Coeur D'alene, Idaho.
Eileen Leahy.
Feel free to drop a line, even if you just wanna hang out.
Bravo.
We're working with these people now.
The better they are, the better we are.
So you killed her?
We'll give you a second chance.
What do you think she wants?
Nothing good.
Going home for Christmas?
I'll be here, as always.
Gentlemen.
Headmistress.
Come with me.
Timothy,
Michael, you have both conquered many trials here at Kendricks, either through natural talent or good old-fashioned hard work.
But today, today we'll learn which of you matriculates to the next level of training.
This organization does important work, gentlemen...
Work which allows millions of people to sleep safely in their beds at night.
But in order to do this work, to protect those people, we need cadets who will employ their skills and execute orders without question.
And so... only one of you will be leaving this room.
Good luck.
He... he fought well.
He didn't want to die.
Yet the code demands otherwise.
Well played, Mr. Davies.
The last place anybody saw Kelly Kline go...
I figured I'd take a look.
And turns out, right after she left, somebody burned down an old warehouse.
I did some digging.
Check your phone.
Okay.
So this chick with her, that, uh, Pat Benatar wannabe?
So...
All right, well, what are we lookin' at here?
Working on it.
Well, go get 'em, Eileen.
That's the plan.
Bye, Sam.
Bye.
Just saying, Dean, even with Cass and every hunter we know working this, we still got basically nothing.
At least, you know, maybe Crowley...
No, dude, we're not calling Crowley...
Did you break into our house?
Did you know your key opens every chapter house in the world?
Well, you did say you'd give me a second chance.
Yeah, that doesn't mean we wanna hang out.
You here for a reason?
I am, and it's a bit urgent.
Some time ago, the home office recorded some sort of cosmic shock wave.
Very rare.
You knew?
Yeah, we knew.
Well, I've got time.
Well, Lucifer jacked the president...
And then knocked up his girlfriend.
And now, she is on the run with Dagon, who is a prince of hell.
'Cause it's kind of a need-to-know kind of thing.
The devil is having a...
Child.
It seems like something we'd need to know.
Where is this woman now?
Not sure.
We had her.
Tried to help her, but, she, uh...
Look, it's not Kelly's fault, okay?
She didn't know Lucifer was her boyfriend.
Plus, she'd agreed to end the pregnancy.
And I guess she changed her mind.
Even with everything Kelly knew, it...
Then you should have!
You should've shot her between the eyes immediately.
Kind of like you killed that werewolf?
'Cause from what I remember, that really messed you up.
Yeah, 'cause you're so big on second chances and all.
Yeah... yes.
I'm not saying it was gonna be easy, but the code demands it.
Oh. "The code."
Do you have any idea what will happen if this abomination is born?
Mick...
So until then...
I say we drink.
Dagon.
Hear me.
I do, sire.
News of my son...
All is well?
As can be expected.
She should last as long as needed.
Well, she better.
Don't fail me, Dagon.
Not again.
Mick, no one's out there.
If we run, we might not get caught.
We need cadets who will execute orders without question.
Mick, we have to go.
Only one of you will be leaving this room.
Mick.
Good luck.
What?
You didn't report in last night, Mr. Davies.
No, I was, uh, I was still in investigation mode.
Making some progress.
Come in, Mr. Rawlings.
You are aware that lady Bevell feels that they are hopeless.
I'm the one cleaning up her mess.
Dr. Hess, last I heard, you and the rest of the leadership felt getting the Winchesters was key to bringing the American hunters on board.
I'm just trying to make that happen.
Yes, well, things change.
And that means?
Something big and bad is on its way, Mr. Davies.
We need the situation in America settled now.
Then let me make it blisteringly simple.
We don't have time to court a handful of mangy colonials.
Not anymore.
So either Sam and Dean and the rest of their ill-bred lot learn to obey, or you turn them over to Mr. ketch... and start fresh.
Look, I don't think...
This is not a discussion.
It's an order.
Are you hearing me, Michael?
Assimilate or eliminate.
What's wrong?
I keep getting these weird little pains.
I'm sure everything's fine.
I need to see a doctor.
No!
I'm not going anywhere until I know my baby's safe.
Wow.
You look like crap.
Yeah, you look crappier.
I gotta hand it to Mick.
Man, you get him started, that guy can drink.
I mean, we can drink, but he's got, like, the "can drink" gold medal.
Hey, you talk to mom lately?
Oh, shouldn't worry about your mum.
Her and ketch make quite the team.
Would you want your mom working with him?
Well, I can't say.
I never really knew my mum.
Or my dad.
I was on the streets till the men of letters found me.
How did they find you?
I, uh, picked a member's pocket.
But I got a cursed coin from ancient Babylon instead.
The men of letters decided I showed promised and signed me up.
They gave me a life.
They, um...
You all right?
Got any vodka?
Hello.
You must be Kelly.
No.
Birth coach.
Sure.
Well, Kelly's vitals and preliminary labs were great.
So we're just gonna do a quick sonogram.
Is that really necessary?
Of course it is.
Want the baby to be a happy camper.
Right over here.
Okay, Kelly.
I'm gonna put a little bit of gel on the camera, so it might be a little bit cold.
Okay.
Say "cheese."
Cheese.
Oh.
Hmm.
Hmm.
What?
Everything looks a-okay.
Everything looks a-okay!
See, Kelly?
Your baby is a little angel, just like I've been saying.
Now I know this can be a little bit awkward, but for the little champ's medical record, what can you tell me about his father?
How the mighty have sunk, eh?
Good puppy.
Puppy want to play?
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
Why?
Why not?
Little bro Michael.
Really?
Yes.
It's your game, your rules, so, uh...
I figure I can work with that.
You win.
What now...
Sire?
Eight, she says.
I've learned not to argue.
So you and Mick...
Longtime friends?
We were in school together.
We learned on the job.
I wanted a quiet, normal life.
Mm.
And yet, there you were, up to your elbows in shifter guts.
Mrs. Winchester...
I believe you're drawn to danger.
Cheers.
Sorry to interrupt.
There's really no need for that, Mr. Davies.
We know each other?
I've been working directly for Dr. Hess since I graduated Kendricks.
Top of my class.
What do you want?
Dr. Hess sent me on the overnight.
Thought you could use an extra set of hands.
Oh.
Oh, to put it another way, you're her lapdog.
Here to keep an eye on me.
I'm here to help.
You want to help?
Stay out of my way.
I'm afraid that's not an option.
Sorry, we're closed for the day.
Those your patient files?
My patient history is none of your business.
Aah!
Will you call me back?
We've got a line on Dagon.
We need your help.
So you ran the plates of every car that drove past that warehouse in Idaho just before it burned down?
It came up registered to Dermott Culp.
So...
So he went missing a year ago.
Okay.
I tracked his car to Iowa.
Found him coming out of a building carrying a dead body.
So Dermott's a killer?
Dermott's a demon.
Hunter.
Demon.
Uh, one of Crowley's?
Works for Dagon.
Covers her tracks.
Smart.
Dude, don't compliment the bad guys.
Uh...
So do you know where Kelly is now?
No, but before Dermott got stabbed in the heart...
Nice.
Yeah, nice.
My loyal... ish subjects, these troubled times,
I'm aware there might be some confusion as to where you're supposed to place your loyalty.
Even with Lucifer back in the cage, there are those of you who would try to help him...
Because he scares you or engorges you.
Just the chance that Lucifer could come back, the rumor, would've been enough to keep some of you working against me, undermining me, being a royal pain in my...
Pert, royal ass.
But lo, the beast has been humbled.
From his own lips, you will hear proclaimed the one, true leader of all hell.
See...
I didn't just beat the devil.
I tamed him.
This is all done of your own free will, is it not?
Yes, my lord.
Look, kids.
He is my dog.
Showtime, Marmaduke.
Yes, my lord.
He's right, my friends.
There is only one true ruler of hell.
And you surrender your heartfelt support to that one true ruler?
Absolutely.
And what do you have to say to those who are still unsure of whom they must obey?
I say this...
Anyone who does not support this one true king, can be assured of suffering unendurable and everlasting agony.
I don't hear applause.
Yeah, got it.
And this article says calcium.
This is Oliver in Dr. Turner's office.
He'd like to see you in the office today.
All right, well, he looked back through your test results and there are some things he'd like to discuss.
Does 5:00 P.M. work for you?
I-I-I don't think I can get away.
Well, he said it's very important.
Good, see you then.
Cool.
I thought you'd be coming alone.
Well, I thought we'd gotten past our trust issues.
Look, if Dagon shows, we're gonna need all the help we can get.
Renny Rawlings.
New man.
Right.
Ah, the banshee girl.
We have a file.
From what Mick tells me, neither of you have any formal training.
Fascinating.
I was top of my class at Kendricks... no one cares.
I, uh, brought the Colt just like you asked.
But it's gotta go back to HQ.
Gee, Mick, I thought we'd gotten past the trust issues.
Hmm.
Dean?
This everyone?
Who's this?
Come on.
Kelly...
You call this helping?
Look, Kelly, that kid, it's...
I mean, it can't...
I mean, it's Lucifer's.
Yeah, I know.
You think I wanted this to happen?
He used me.
But I love this child.
You will mean absolutely nothing to that child.
That child will kill us all.
Hey.
She's here.
Hey.
I was shooting at the demon.
It was an accident.
It's all right.
Hey!
She killed a man of letters.
S-she has to die.
The code.
No, hey, screw the code.
Don't make this harder than it already is.
Mick, you don't have to do this.
Yes, I do!
Please.
Don't.
Please.
Please don't.
The code demands otherwise.
Please.
Please!
Mick, Mick, listen to me.
Mick, look, I-i know you guys h-have this men of letters code you blindly answer to, but...
Look, you don't have to do that, Mick.
You're better than that.
You only have to answer to yourself.
You only have to do what you know is right.
You only have to answer to your own code.
Just go.
Yeah.
Well, that was unexpected.
But invigorating.
I must say, when I first met you, I didn't see this coming.
My thought at the time was,
"I'll end up shooting this one." Hmm.
Life is full of surprises.
Ketch.
Yes?
Like?
Like...
It means anything.
Truth is, I'm not...
Built for that.
And I suspect you aren't either.
You're wrong.
But that was a long time ago.
So we're good?
We are.
And I notice you took my advice.
Advice?
You know what?
It's not either/or.
I have the same discussion with my boys.
I'm not choosing hunting over them.
Why does it have to be one or the other?
So you want to have it all?
Tryin' to.
Good for you.
So how we lookin'?
You're sure Crowley is occupied elsewhere?
Yeah, he's on his rounds.
Crowley's got, like, two and a half more hours of gettin' his pert, royal ass kissed.
Well, upper left quadrant is sound.
Lower left, likewise.
You made the right decision, you know.
'Cause when the dust settles, there's only gonna be one of us standing...
And it ain't gonna be the guy with the accent, if you know what I mean.
I'm very, very impressed.
Uh...
You'll be happy to know the...
The vessel is completely sound.
The repairs are secure.
And the security system?
Whatever it is that lets Crowley turn me into his own personal sock puppet.
I don't hear words.
The... the s-system is very much I-intact.
But you can disarm it?
I'm not really known for my Patience.
I don't quite have the means...
Where is he?
Dead.
Dead?
Dead.
Uh, yeah, after the system was installed,
Crowley killed Spivak to safeguard its secrets.
Mm.
Well...
You can crack it, right?
Good.
'Cause I am gettin' stir crazy.
And I'm about to be a dad.
You okay?
No.
He wasn't a monster.
He was...
I...
Hey.
It was a mistake.
Why are you doing this?
Oh, don't even.
I tried, but clearly, you can't be trusted.
I was worried about the baby.
I'm trying to protect him.
I mean, you don't need to.
I wasn't lying.
Your baby's strong, so strong.
Whatever happens, he is going to be just fine.
But you...
Won't.
Yeah, those weird little pains?
Just a taste of what's to come.
'Cause, you know, birthing a nephilim?
Fatal.
Always.
Ketch.
Why'd you call me here?
Oh, I didn't.
Mr. Davies.
Dr. Hess.
I didn't think you left London.
I don't.
But I have been tasked by the other elders to fix this rapidly deteriorating situation.
Two days ago, according to your own report, you let a prince of hell escape and the mother of Lucifer's child.
These hunters are out of control.
The brothers Winchester, in particular, which lady Bevell has exhaustedly documented.
Ma'am, if... if you could just listen...
No.
I don't think I will.
Hunters are dogs, Mr. Davies.
You give them an order, and they obey.
That's how it works.
So tell me, do they?
Do they obey you?
No.
Of course not.
So...
This Eileen Leahy will be found and killed in accordance with the code.
As for the Winchesters, like any rebellious hunter, they will be investigated.
And, if found guilty, executed.
"If"?
If they're found guilty?
Aren't hunters always found guilty?
Be careful, Mr. Davies.
No.
My entire life with the men of letters,
I never broke a rule.
And yes, at first I was shocked at how Sam and Dean operate.
But what lady Bevell doesn't mention is the lives they've saved, monsters destroyed, and outcomes made better not because of the code, but because of Sam and Dean Winchester's sense of what's right.
And that is the crux of the matter.
The code is not a suggestion.
It's an absolute.
The code is what separates us from the monsters.
It is the order by which we all live.
No.
The code is what makes a young boy kill his best friend.
When I was a child, I had nothing.
I owed you everything, and I obeyed.
But I'm a man now, Dr. Hess, and I can see the choices, and I choose to do the right thing.
Mornin'.
Mornin'.
Hey, you, uh, you hear anything from Cass yet?
You think he's all right?
I don't know.
Where's Eileen?
She took off.
Uh, said she's heading back to Ireland for a while.
Just needs some time, I guess.
Mm.
Yeah, I get that.
Mm.
Ah.
Welcome back, sweetheart.
It's over.
The grand experiment recruiting American hunters has failed.
Utterly.
Mm.
What would you like me to do?
Exterminate them.
