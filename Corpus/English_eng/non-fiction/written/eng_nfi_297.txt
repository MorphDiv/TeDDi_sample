Thanks.
Oh, cheers, hm.
Are you South African?
Erm, no, I'm from Brisbane.
Where the fuck is that?
( REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING )
Wow.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Well, I...
So, er, where are you?
Come on...
It actually means that you have a lack of calcium.
No, it means I've been drinking too much beer.
That's what it means.

Help yourself.
My father grows them in a schrebergarten.
In, uh, cardboard boxes?
No, these are from the store.
Do you like strawberries?
Um...
They help you forget your problems.
What makes you think I have problems?
People who travel alone... are usually in search of something, aren't they?
What makes you think that I'm alone?
I see nobody.
Do you always practice your English... chatting up foreigners?
I work in a sport school.
What sort of sports?
I mean, I'm an English teacher, that's why.
Buildings, mostly.
I, er, I really like the GDR architecture.
I wanna do a book.
We say DDR, Deutsche Demokratische Republik.
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
What did you...
You said this was, er, from a schreber...
Erm, these are small gardens.

It's my mum.
She's kind of obsessed.
Does she know you're here?
Yeah.
My mother used to bring me here as a boy.
I always come here to complicate life.
What?
Erm, I think you mean to, er, you'd say "contemplate."
Oh, yeah, right.
How do you say "complicate" in German?
Verkomplizieren.
This one is nice, huh?
Yeah, I like it.
( DOG BARKING ) Oh!
Sorry.
Yeah, he likes you.
( IMITATES BARKING )
Oh, my God.
So, why did you come to Berlin?
Er, I was working for a real estate company... taking photos and, erm...
You know, those life experiences... that people talk about all the time?
I wanted to do that, so, I...
I booked a ticket and put my stuff in storage... and came here.
Pretty predictable.
A wolf.
( GROWLS )
( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING )
There's a bar upstairs, erm, if you wanted to... come-- actually, it's more like a... kinda crappy rooftop.
I'm afraid I have to meet someone.

She's holding her hands like that... to hide her deformed finger.
I thought you wanted to leave.
So, if you have a question, you Google it.
Yeah.
Are you not?
You photograph disappointment.
I mean, all this DDR shit, all these dreams... it's all... invalid.
But the people were brave.
How do you say suffocate in German?
Uh...
Ersticken.
Erwurgen is...
Did a boy give you that?
No, my mum... did.
She said if I ever got into trouble...
I could hock it and come home.

Silke, may I ask you to please read the quote?
"Perhaps home is not a place, but simply..."
Erm... "An irrevocable condition"?
Bennie, I see you obviously... consumed this book on the weekend.
James Baldwin wrote this in 1956 in his novel Giovanni's Room.
Who has made a start on it?
Hm?
Franka?
Erm...
Er, the character is constantly moving.
He feels a little bit shame about, erm, about himself... but he says he is, erm, finding himself... but he's just...

Did you lock me in?
( BOTH CHUCKLE )

Don't do that.
You don't have to do this.

Andi, what is going on?
"What is going on?"
You could have gone to Dresden.
You said you want to stay.
We had sex.
People-- people say all sorts of things in bed.
It doesn't necessarily mean anything.
