This isn't her ship.

Aneela's abilities with the Green are unlike anyone else's.

These ships are key to reaching Aneela.
And so far, they only respond to D'Avin.

All right, boys and girls.
Strap in, put on some smooth jazz, and welcome to our first flight maneuvers test run.
Nice and easy.
These ships are running organic tech that we don't fully understand yet, but with my fancy glove controllers spliced with D'Av's DNA, those controls should be your bitch.

I figured she just took Lucy... get some space, clear her head.
When I went to get her for the flight test this morning, she still wasn't back.
