Previously on the strain...

At least in here I can pretend things are normal.
Not for me it isn't.
This is a whiskey 8-5-mod-4 variable-yield nuclear warhead.
It's missing the pit assembly.
That muncher convoy we saw.

"Join the partnership." New horizons.
It was on the wall in the transportation office.
And the train schedule, too.

I don't know.

Come on.
Shit.
Well, there's a town...

Might be able to get a car or at least siphon off some gas.
Where is everyone?
Yeah, I guess we're both a little on edge.
Yeah.
What's so wrong about this place?
I don't know.
Doesn't look like anybody put up a fight.
Huh.
No signal but there's some...
Juice in the battery.
You looking for something in particular or...
Just being a creep?
Maybe a clue to figure out what happened around here.
Hi, I'm Emily Stevens, and this is my vlog.
I have enough peanut butter and...
Tuna for, like, a really long time.
I don't care if dad traded for a cool new suitcase;
I'm not going.
That was dated two weeks ago.

I just finished decorating my room.
They can do what they want...

Fortunately, the workers never finished my closet.
Dad has no idea.
Maybe she's still here?
Emily!
Yeah?
It's almost curfew.
Come inside and pack.

I promise you're gonna love the new place.
We're gonna have a garden, you'll be able to play outside whenever you want.
Doesn't that sound nice?

This is her house.
Emily?
You worried about strigoi?
I'm worried about a strigoi Emily.
Emily?
Must have gone with her parents.
You think?
I don't see any cool new suitcase around here.
You coming to bed?
Oh, um...
I should probably hit the couch.
Didn't mean it like that.
The safest thing for us to do is to be together.
I promise I won't take advantage of you, doctor Goodweather.
No, it's not like that.

I...

Will you just shut up so we can go to sleep?
Every time we get to a silo, these assholes beat us.
We're running out of silos to hit.

They'll be outta here soon.
What the hell is that thing?
A mongrel.
The master's mongrels were baked on loam, and anointed with a worm exchange over two full moons.
Obviously.
A frontal assault at this point would decimate our ranks.
You might be right.
With these munchers and mongrels, and all those collaborators...
Hitting them now would be suicidal.
Finally, we agree on something.
Yeah. we're gonna have to take 'em on the move.
So they're clearly taking the pits south on route 5... but where?
Might be going to the salt mine down state to dispose of 'em?

From that convoy?

Come on Ben, we can handle it.

We all saw those mongrel monsters.
They even made Rob zombie nervous.
Quinlan could take 'em.
Quinlan can't even take care of himself right now.
Charlotte's spoon feeding him our blood.
You know, I think I've given enough.
If they don't want to help, then I'll do it myself.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hey.
We need those guys.
I need no one.

Yeah. now how's that working out for you?
Don't test me.
Look, I get it.

But what you're doing right now is stupid.
All right?

You almost died in that silo but I got you out.
So don't fight me, work with me, and we'll get this job done.
Right, the guys are in.
What changed their minds?

I didn't see any silver.

That's my girl!

Hey!
Hey.
All right.
Yes!
Your blood.
Thank you, Charlotte.
Hu die.
Has there been any word yet?
I have seen no one of the type you search for.
Not here, not ever.
Go.
Abandon your quest, unless you would like to come in, see for yourself?
Tell your brother I wish him...

It is too late for that.
Clergyman's daughter, are you?

Take a walk with us.

You bitch!

You seek me?
Why?
You are... an immortal.
No!

You're wanted downstairs.
I thought you might be hungry.
Please. sit.
I had so hoped we could have a civilized conversation.
Go to hell, you sick piece of shit.
Wouldn't you like to survive this ordeal,
Ms. Velders?
Your blood type is incredibly...
Desirable.
But, much like veal there is nothing better than infant B positive.
What's the point of this...
Charade?
I want you to enjoy a meal;
you haven't eaten in days.

the makeup, the suits, the bullshit civility.
You've won.
You can be like your own kind now.
No.
I'm different.
I'm special.
Apart from all the others, the master blessed with me with free will.
He entrusted me with implementing his vision of this world.
What do you want from me?
Abraham Setrakian.
Perhaps you can tell me his whereabouts while you enjoy your meal...
Or I can make a meal of you.
Then the master will know everything.
Your minions separated us when they brought us in.
I'm sure Setrakian has been drained and discarded by now.
The very... system that you created has robbed you of your greatest victory.
You will never have the satisfaction of lording your big win over him.
Mr. Desai, check your records.
An old man between the ages of 70 and 100 had been processed the same day she was.

Right away, Mr. Eichhorst.
All right, I have, um, four B positive men in his age range that were processed that day.
Is one of them Setrakian?
Um...

OK, two of them were drained, one of them died of pneumonia three weeks prior...

Last one's in a bone marrow experiment.
Where is he?

Research wing seven.
Seven.
I'll check for myself.
Mr. Eichhorst?
What about her?
Hold her until I verify it's Setrakian.
Then...
Drain her.
'Re actually in the middle of an experiment on geriatric patients to expand their viable blood production lifespan.
I'm not interested in your experiments!
I'm looking for this old man a230385.
I...

Where is he?

Here.
Nurse?
Nurse?
Wake him.
Now.
Bone marrow extraction's incredibly painful and he's been heavily sedated.
A regimen of amphetamines would be too stressful for his heart.
I mean, it could kill him.

"Doctor Joseph Himoff."
Nurse Cohen, 600 milligrams of dextroamphetamine, please.
Quinlan, you in position?
Yes.
The same position I was in 30 minutes ago.
Do I sit here with a demon?
Were you not sent by one?

No. my brother.
Your brother sends you looking for demons?
He seeks your gift...

He lies near death, beyond the help of medicine.
His curiosity about the dark arts revealed your secrets to him.
He begged me to find someone from your exotic order.
My "order" is not one I'd wish any soul to join.
If...
Money or property is of no allure to you...
You'd do this for your brother?
Please. he suffers so.
I am indeed a demon, but my curse is my own.

I beseech you.

Louisa, darling?
Who is with you?
Someone...
Fantastic.
A strix!
The immortal race?

O beautiful fiend, show me your teeth.
I want to know forever!

Syphilis.
The great pox.
For a time I covered the guilty rash and became quite artful with stage makeup, but now now it has his mind.
Release him.
A draught of laudanum from hu die.
I can't.
Losing my twin is like losing half myself.
I don't want to live without him.
Are there any others of your kind who might...
There are no others in all of London town.
Of that I'm certain.
Mother!
Child, what is it?
I had a bad dream, mother.
I thought I saw a monster.
Welcome Mr...?
Quinlan.
Welcome Mr. Quinlan to our home like a proper lady.
How long you been up here?
Lie down.

I haven't seen stars in nine months.
Couldn't sleep?
Yeah. me, too.
You ever wonder what life would have been like if this never happened?
I try not to.
I always thought I'd move out of Philly one day.
Get a house like this.
Live the American dream.
Yeah, I wasn't really cut out for suburban bliss.
You know what I mean.
No matter how you might have felt about your old life it was better than this.
Slide me that weapon.
You wanna lock the door, sweetheart?
At are you two doing here?

You know they send strigoi enforcers through here every couple days.

Thanks for the advice.

Sorry 'bout that.
It's all right.
We understand.

I'm running out of time.

If we work together, we can turn it around.
No. me?
I'm done.
Look at me.
You're turning.
Goddamn monsters.
It's just my luck.
I escaped from that new horizons, then this happens.
You escaped?

They sold us all a bill of goods.
Told us we won't have to worry about rations and curfew anymore.
We were going to start a farming community.
I got to that welcome center...
I just got a weird feeling.
Saw a delivery truck leaving, hid in the back.
Figured I had enough in cans to last a while...
And I'd scavenge the rest.
So you didn't actually see the farming community?
I didn't want to.
That truck pulled out, I rolled out the back, took the back roads to here.
Been hiding out ever since.
Could you find it again if you had to?
I guess but I don't want to.
This is important.

If I can, maybe we can beat them.
A230385.
Welcome back.
Rather...
An imaginary snake attack me than see your face, Eichhorst.
Where am I, exactly?
Don't you know?
This... is the end.
Of what?
Of everything.
Of our decades-long conflict.
Of Abraham Setrakian.
Even on my deathbed, your pettiness is nothing more than an annoyance.
Oh, don't you worry.
You're not going to die.
Not yet.
First,
I need you to do something for me.
Then and only then will I allow you to pass.
I will do nothing for you.
But what I ask is so simple and will ensure your suffering is brief.
I just need you
that your god does not exist.
For your sake, you should hope that he does not.
Oh, Abraham, I know he doesn't.
I just need to hear you say it!
I'll see you...
In hell, Eichhorst.
Yes.
But you are already there.
You are the lucky ones.
The shaving is just the first step in a new radiation inoculation, which will help with the potential side effects from the illumination.
What's this?
She's priority, per Mr. Desai.
Thank you.

You OK?
All right, curly, you're up.
Take a seat.
Eyes down.

This is all a lie!

You're all about to be murdered!

Just like the babies that they are draining in here!
Our babies!

That's what they're counting on.
That we will willingly go to the slaughter!
Come on!

Guards!

Control yourselves!

Get the others out of here!

My friend might be alive!

I have to help him.
Evacuate!

Come on!
Professor?
Professor!
Ms. Velders, how... are you?
I'm better now I've found you.
How touching.
I'm sorry to say that your reunion will be short.
What can you possibly do with that?
Watch out!

Run him over!
That guy you just ran over?
He's on the trailer now!
Ah!
Ah!
Resist the temptation to read anything into the fact that I saved you.
Again.

We better hurry.
Reinforcements will be on the way.
Yeah, and I'd bet my bed roll that there's a tracking device on this truck.
Let's get that silver and get the hell outta here.
Uh, yeah.

I, uh, might have stretched the truth about exactly how much silver we saw being loaded into the truck.

Approximately?
None.

Oh, come on!
You're telling me we risked our lives taking this convoy so that you could get plutonium and we could get nothing?
I wouldn't say "nothing."
You have our undying gratitude.
I'm guessing the partnership will do better.
In fact, I'm fairly certain they'll pay a pretty penny to get their plutonium back, along with you and hairless, dead or...
Wait!

Move!

Come on!
You want to go in that truck?

!

Oh, I wasn't planning on being anything but careful.
Took your time.
We got the pit...

Nothing matters until the master's destroyed.
You just can't be happy, can you?
Bring me another!

I want the curse.

I'm not ready to...

Please!

Louisa!

Because of compassion.

I don't know.

I don't know how I will go on without my twin brother.
I would be shut away in Broadmoor forever if not for Lydia...

Me?
Cyril would recount for me tales of history, bloody battles, and palace intrigue.
You have lived them.
You are a strange creature.
Will you indulge me?
You're quite beautiful.
Please,
I want to feel it.
Our father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name;
thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom, and the power and the glory forever.
Amen.
Sister Agnes, what's this?
A relic from overseas?
Sister... did you open it already?
Soil?
Francis?
Stay close to the shoulder.
If you hear a vehicle, hide.
How are you feeling?
Like I'm dying slowly.
You're doing the right thing taking us there.
What's the point?

No, you won't.

I'll make sure of it.

You're gonna kill me first.

It beats the alternative.
I went that way to the welcome center.
But we should take the access road.
What we're looking for probably won't be at some welcome center anyway.
I've been thinking.
The master reverted our information society to a technological society in a matter of weeks.
This new horizon seems like another step backwards to an agrarian society.
He wants us to be farmers?
Not a chance.
Oh, dear lord.
Is that...?
Yeah.
You okay?
There's something evil down that road.
I don't want to see it.
I didn't want to see it before and I definitely don't want to see it now.
This is my last day on this planet.
I can't.
No, I won't go.
Francis, if I don't release you, you'll turn into one of them.

You mean murder me.

I don't want you to kill me.
I did what you asked!
Go.
It's her choice.
That smell...

Nothing good.

Don't want to...
I feel like we need to.
You hear that?
Yeah.
Goodweather.
I knew you'd surface.
Yeah, I'm back.
You know where I am?
New horizons.
You did not release this body when you had the chance.
Perhaps you hoped to hear from me... about your son.
Zack's alive?
Yes. he is an apt student.
You would be astounded by his progress had you not fled New York like a coward.
You okay?
Yeah.
Let's finish this.
Oh, my god.
This is the master's final solution.
We're not the farmers;
