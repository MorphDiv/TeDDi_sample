Why did you do it?
Jeong Woo.
(3 days before Wolha-dong murder incident)
(Cha Min Ho)
What do you mean... there's no way out?
No.
Min Ho.
(Cha Min Ho)
Seon Ho.
Rest in peace.
I talked it over with President Cha.
Chamyung won't make a problem with this.
I like everything about Jeong Woo, except that he never listens.
I'll talk to him.
He's the worst enemy of Chamyung Group.
I should kick him out to the country.
Yes.

What do you mean, an arrest warrant?
Did you give him a permission?
How dare he get on President Cha's nerves?
Where's Jeong Woo?
Prosecutor Park, what is it?
Okay, my phone.
(Chief Prosecutor Choi)
Here.
- What do I do?

We've gone to a sauna today, okay?
Let's go.
What?

- Why?

Chamyung just settled down... after the recent death of Cha Min Ho.
If the assistant prosecutor general finds out, we're as good as dead.
People from Chamyung...
Gosh.

Detective Ko, you've gotten very weak.
I've always been weak.
I'm getting off.

Hey, I thought you said we'll stick together until we die.
Wait, Prosecutor Park, does Chief Prosecutor Choi know?
If I die, I'll die alone.
He needs to be promoted this year.
My goodness, you drive me crazy.
I'm not sure what you did with the fingerprint at the NISI, but you won't get off this time.
Chemical plant has also succeeded in its turnaround this year.
- Excuse me.

You must run.
- What is it?

I believe he wants to check your fingerprint again.
- Don't keep him waiting.

- See you up there.

Over there.
- You can take that side.

Let's go.
My fingerprint?
What did he get his hands on?
Let's go quietly, President Cha.
There are guests here.
Why don't you give up now?
Think of the people you hurt and killed.
Now you've even murdered Cha Seon Ho.
If you became Cha Seon Ho, did you think you'd be able to get away?
Prosecutor Park.
What on earth are you talking about?
This is the end for you.
Cha Min Ho.
No.
No!
Park Jeong Woo.
You'll never be able to catch me.
Cha Min Ho!
Minister, thank you for coming.
President Cha, are your hands all right?
There was a slight incident while inspecting a factory.
Please, why don't you go inside?
Yes, Detective.
Why are we having lunch at a fancy hotel?
Anyhow, hurry on over.
President Cha.
What brings you here?
Shall we have a talk?
I have to go eat.
What is it?
This is quite painful.
You're right.
I'm Cha Min Ho.
Try proving... that I'm Cha Min Ho.
I'm just kidding.
It's just that you seemed to want to hear this so badly.
Then... enjoy your meal.
"I'm Cha Min Ho."
"I'm..."
"Cha Min Ho"!
"I'm..."
"Cha Min Ho."
I'll make sure you say this with your own mouth.
I wish you luck.
You're right.
I'm Cha Min Ho.
Try proving... that I'm Cha Min Ho.
I'm sure you won't be able to change your voice,
Cha Min Ho.
What is this?

I was told not to let anyone else know.
What's so important that Prosecutor Park had to call us this early?
Why isn't he showing up?
Prosecutor Park isn't answering his phone.
What is this?
Hello?

- Yes, this is Reporter Ahn.

- Excuse me?

Is it true?
(Seoul Central Office Homicide Prosecutor Park kills his family.)
Yes.

This is Prosecutor Park, isn't it?
What is this?
What's going on?
- What?

(Innocent Defendant)
(Episode 3)
(Seoul Yangseo Police Station)
Excuse me.

Over there.
Thank you.
- Detective Oh?

Hello.
If you have time, can we talk over some coffee?
- You called earlier.

Sure.

The chair's so cold.
- Thank you.

Isn't it nearly a closed case?

It was just as tense around here as well.
There's never been a prosecutor that committed murder in history.
That's true.
And what's more, it was a veteran homicide prosecutor.
I met him a couple of times while investigating this case.
Do you know what the first thing Prosecutor Park said?
What did he say?
Ji Soo...
Ji Soo...
I killed Ji Soo.
Really?
Are you sure you heard correctly?
I heard it clearly.
Was there more?

Then he went straight to the prosecution.
"I killed..."
"Ji Soo."
That answers everything.
- Who do you think killed her?

- Undoubtedly?

We have the motive and evidence.
- The motive?

The man she apparently had an affair with hasn't even been found.
Even so, there is absolute proof that he killed her.
A person can't be sentenced to death easily if there wasn't evidence.
Could I possibly get a copy of the on-site investigation video?
I wasn't able to find it.
- We don't have it.

- It's at the prosecution office.

He was a prosecutor in office.
They wouldn't want the video going around.
Aren't you his attorney?

Excuse me?
You see, I have a lot of cases to cover.
I must have gotten confused.
If you remember anything else, please let me know.
I'll buy you a drink sometime.
Don't try too hard.
It's an obvious case.
Here is what you asked for.
Be careful.

It was so difficult to find this.
- Eun Hye.

You can't tell anyone I gave this to you.
I won't tell anyone.
You know how good I am at keeping secrets.
That's why they call me Loyal Eun Hye, you know.
Why are you so interested in this case, anyhow?
What?
I'm just trying to make a living.
If I lose this case, I might even lose my job as a public defender.
I don't have a father or uncle that can pull strings for me like you.
You...
Suh Eun Hye.
My mistake.

I'm grateful I have a friend like you.
Thank you.
I'll place it here.
Stop groaning.
Everything was burnt except for that one.
- Unbelievable.

No.
No.
No!
Hey, are you okay?
Are you bleeding?
No, I'm not.

It hurts.
Inmate 3866.
Do you think you are the only one in this room?
Are we just puppets lying around or something?
- Are we?

He just lost his memory again two days ago.
Hey, you must be getting comfortable in here.
People may cut you some slack because you were a prosecutor, but that's not the case in here.
If you don't want to be beaten, stay quiet.

Come on.

Seong Kyu.
You should tell him the truth.
What did I do?
The reason why people don't beat Inmate 3866.
My goodness.
Did you really think... we didn't beat you because you were Mr. Prosecutor?
No.
We don't beat two types of people in here.
An economic offender who's rich, or a death-row inmate who is about to die... and go up there.
Shut it, you jerk.
Do you see this?
You never know... what these death-row inmates will do.
He killed his family.

Hey, watch it.
- Hey.

- Get off of him.

- Say it again.

- Hey, hey.

- What's going on in here?

- Darn it.

- Say it again.

Do it again.

You are very bold.
How can you mess with a death-row inmate?
Darn you.
I'm just joking.
It's not even certain yet.
Hey.
It's been a while, so let's introduce ourselves again.
We did this every time he lost his memory.
We haven't got much to do anyway.

To Inmate 3866, we're all strangers.
Isn't that right, Inmate 3866?
Right?
Let me get started.
Before I got in here, I had a few gambling parlors.
Here we go again.

Hey, 10 minutes, 1 hour, all we've got is time.
Go ahead.
I had a lot of money...
And girlfriends, and he had good cars.
He ate a lot of good food and went to the bathroom often, too.
- And many criminal records.

Darn you guys.
This is why we eat a lot of food brought from the outside.
Who else eats like us?
I know.

You do know that we're thankful, right?
Anyway, I was reported for my parlor and I got sentenced to three years.
Sir, go.
Well, things happened, and I killed two people.
You and Inmate 3866 are the same.
- Don't do that.

If you ever color his number tag in red again, you're as good as dead.
My gosh.
Hey.
Let the old man skip.
It breaks my heart every time I hear it.
Yes.

You look very young for your age.
Maybe it's because you've lived here for long.
Stop it.
My gosh, he's so happy.
He is, isn't he?
He's pretty.
Okay.

I'm not Rockfish.
With your face, you should be thankful for rockfish.
Are you crazy?

Give your face to a dog.
Did you just curse my mom?
I didn't say you were a dog's baby.

You said I had a dog for a mother.
I don't mess with families.
My grandpa and grandma must be dogs, too.
- What's with you?

- Do you want to continue?

- You?

Let's move on to Inmate 3866.
Can I pass?
No way.

You have to say it here in order to let things out.
I don't remember.
It's okay.
Everyone here sinned once.
Just tell us.
Hey, don't you really remember?
It's not like a movie.

The doctors said that it can happen.
We saw it the last time.
We've seen it, but can we believe him?
Buildings 3 and 4, get ready to go.
Yes, Sir!
What kind of bread are we getting today?
- I'll give you a punch bread.

We have to go.
Thank you for giving us our daily bread.
- Do you like it?

Mommy's here.
Mommy?
Dad, wake up.
Dad, wake up already.
- Dad, wake up.

- I'll wake up.

Wake up, Honey.
Ji Soo.
Ha Yeon.
Chamyung isn't just a brand, and it's not just a name.
As a representative company of this country, we must satisfy consumers' needs and lead the culture as well.
Even in difficulties, my father turned them into opportunities... to bring up Chamyung this far.
I just take after my father and abide to his will.
You are indeed a humble man.
How is your relationship with your wife?
I heard you two dated since you studied in Harvard.
Does she still make your heart flutter?
That's the case for me, but I'm not sure about her.
I'm not too confident.
Sometimes I can't believe... he is my husband.
He seems like a new man every day.
I guess he treats you very well.
Is that how it seemed?
I really envy you two.
Right, I saw your family portrait.
Your son looks exactly like you, President Cha.
Do you have plans to have a second child?
I always want... another child.
But I promised her that I'll follow her decision.
And I have a few things to do.
So for a while, it'll just be Eun Soo and us.
Let's finish up by taking a picture.
Sure.
- Thank you.

- Thank you.

Great job.
What's our next schedule?
You have a meeting with Mr. Cho of SB Group in 30 minutes.
Oh, gosh.
I wanted to grab a cup of tea with you.
I'm fine.
See you at home, then.
Don't let anyone in.

Yes, President.
Mr. Cho of SB Group.
(Cho Su Hwan, SB Group)
SB Group, Cho Su Hwan.
SB Group, Cho Su Hwan.
(Profile for Cho Su Hwan)
There's no use in glaring at that.
It won't bring your wife and daughter back to life.
Why did you kill them in the first place?
Gosh, stop it!
- You!

- Seong Kyu.

Don't ever get married.
Okay?

You will face a rough ride.

Moongchi.
- Drink this.

Did I kill them?
(Fact Relevance of the Case)
Who is he?
Jeong Woo, I will explain everything about the photo.
Who is he?

Please keep it down.

Why did you do that when you care about her so much?
Why?

Defendant Park Jeong Woo... started an argument with his wife Yoon Ji Soo about her affair.
During the quarrel, he killed his wife in a rage... and suffocated his daughter Park Ha Yeon.
Then he abandoned the body in a suitcase.
(Fact Relevance of the Case)
Did I do that?
Ji Soo.

I have to go home.
I have to go home.
- Did you have dinner?

When does she like to marry?
She deals with brutal criminals every day.

I wish she'd join a law firm.
- That's him!

He's a brute!
- He should die.

You idiot!
How did you stab her?

That's enough.
(Prosecutor Park Jeong Woo)
(Friends of 15 Years Becoming Prosecutor and Defendant)
(Friends of 15 Years Becoming Prosecutor and Defendant)
President Cha.
Yes.
Are you all right?

No, it's okay.

President Cha, there is some mail for you.
(To Mr. Cha Seon Ho)
- When did you get it?

Who is doing this?
If you became Cha Seon Ho, did you think you'd be able to get away?
Park Jeong Woo.
I don't remember anything.
I don't remember anything.
Where am I?
Please help me.
Ha Yeon!

Help me.

Is it that... his memory has returned?
(Prosecutor Kang Jun Hyuk)
Are you taking on Jeong Woo's case?
Yes, I'm Public defender Seo Eun Hye.
I'm Prosecutor Kang Jun Hyuk.
- Nice to meet you.

I heard you are a friend of Park Jeong Woo's.
- Right.

I did it as the prosecutor, not as his friend.
What is this?
It's the video of the spot investigation.
- So?

I have no idea what you mean.
I think you are mistaken.
What's that?
What are you doing?
It's lame, isn't it?
I poked you with my left hand even though I'm right-handed.
The man in the video looked just as clumsy as I am.
The man in the video is right-handed... while Park Jeong Woo is left-handed.
How did you know that...
Jeong Woo is left-handed?
He once... slapped me in the face.
Excuse me.
Do you call yourself an attorney?
Now you sneak into the prosecutor's office and steal the data?
What if the defendant of this case is not the criminal?
What if there is another slice of truth?
Even if there is another slice of truth, it won't change anything at the trial.
Now I understand why it was so hard to get this video.
How could you conduct a spot inspection with a stand-in?
That's just unbelievable.
How could you do that?
Are you really his friend?
I am his friend.
And the victim, Ji Soo... was my friend, too.
Jeong Woo lost his memory.
On the day of the spot inspection.
It was impossible.
And there was no guarantee that he would regain his lost memory.
We have absolute evidence of his guilt.
It's not difficult to substantiate his charge... without the spot inspection.
Does Park Jeong Woo know about it?
Jeong Woo... would understand.
We will see.
If he'd understand it or not.
Ha Yeon, say hi.
I love you.

It's Mommy's turn.
Mommy loves you very much.
Say I love you.
The battery is dead.
Let's take a photo with a polaroid.
- Sit next to Mommy.

Ha Yeon.
That's good.

- What are you doing?

Wait, wait.

- Gosh.

Thank you.
Perfect.

In 1, 2, 3!
(Yoon Ji Soo)
(Yoon Ji Soo)
Ji Soo.
I'm sorry.
Wait a little bit longer.
I'll make sure...
I find Ha Yeon.
I'll bring her... so that you two can be together.
(Establish Law and Order, Morality)
You'd like to meet Inmate 3866 personally?
Yes.
Will that be necessary?
He lost his memory again a couple of days ago.
I observed him since then and he seemed to be adjusting quite well.
Is that right?
How are you?
How are you, Mr. Park?
I must be crazy.

It's been quite a while, Mr. Park.
What if he doesn't remember me?
Prosecutor.
Attorney Seo Eun Hye?
(Predecessor Public Defender Agreement)
I heard your attorney quit... because you lost your memory.
I'm aware your appellate trial is coming up soon.
(Predecessor Public Defender Agreement)
Mr. Park.
You don't have anymore attorneys to choose from now.
We both know you're much better and experienced than I am.
But I think it'll be better you have an attorney.
Mr. Park.
I did some research.

You know how serious that is, right?
- Leave.

What about the appellate trial?
I heard you didn't remember anything during the first trial.
You know you need someone to help you.
You want to help me?
Yes.
All right.

- Pardon?

I don't need anything else.
- If we prepare for the trial...

If I stand trial, will I be able to recover my memory?
Then I'll stand trial... if you promise me that.
You can't, can you?
I can't promise you that your memory will come back, but I'm sure you'll remember some things while preparing for trial.
You should at least try to avoid the death penalty, shouldn't you?
Repeat what you just said.
What did you say?
If it was really me...
If I really killed them,
I would face the death penalty a thousand times.
At least avoid the death penalty?
What will that change?
What will change if I avoid the death penalty?
What will change if I avoid the death penalty?

What will that change?
Guard!
Go.
Sign here, please.
(Predecessor Public Defender Agreement)
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
Let's go.
Spread your arms.
Yes.

Inmate 3866.

Inmate 3866 has a dangerous object in possession.
Let go.

I have to go home.
- Just let me go home.

Officer Moon.
- Get him!

Inmate 3866.
You've come all this way, President.
If you insist on seeing him personally, I'll bring him to you.
What's wrong?
Inmate 3866!
Inmate 3866!
Move away!
What's he doing?
Don't come close!
Don't come.
- What should we do?

Park Jeong Woo.
Let me out of here.
You scum.

I'll kill him if you come closer.
No, don't.

- You'll hurt President Cha.

There's been a misunderstanding.
Stay still.

Don't...
- come closer.

Take it easy.
I'm going to kill him.

Hurry and open the door.

- What are you doing?

What do you mean you can't?
Are you going to take responsibility if President Cha gets injured?
Warden!
He doesn't have anywhere to go.
I have to go home.
I have to go home!
What is it?
Tae Soo.

Tae Soo.
(Concession is virtue.

Tae Soo.
Why are you here?
You've lost your memory again?
Tae Soo.
Let me go home.
Ji Soo and Ha Yeon are waiting for me.
There's no longer... a house with Ji Soo and Ha Yeon to return to.
That's not true.
Just let me go home.
Tae Soo.
Just let me go home.
It's all because of you.
Are you all right, Sir?
No.
That's not true.
That's not true!
President Cha, are you all right?
How could this have happened?
What are you guys doing?

It's not true, Tae Soo.
- Tae Soo, that's not true.

That's not true, Tae Soo.
Tae Soo.

Tae Soo.

- Move it!

President Cha.

Inmate 3866 must have lost his mind.
President Cha.

It's all right.
Is Mr. Park Jeong Woo okay?

What happened?
I can't tell you anything.
I will leave as soon as I find out he's okay.
I said no.
Visiting hours are over.
Please leave the visiting room.
Did you hear that?
Sir.
I will leave as soon as I check on something.
Is Mr. Park Jeong Woo all right?
(Woljeong Prison)
(Correction for a Better Future)
- Find out who it is from.

Anything else?
Stay still.

No.

Ji Soo!

Park Jeong Woo.
Is it that he doesn't remember me?
(Commission Ceremony)
Jeong Woo, put it on.
- I'm honored.

Smile.
He Yeon.
Congratulations!
Tae Soo, let me wash your back.
It really hurts.
Be a man.
Look at the dirt on your back.
That's too harsh.
It doesn't hurt.
It's not harsh at all.
Come here.

Let me see your back.
You have a dirty back.
It hurts.
When will you be finished?
Tae Soo.
It's not me.
I didn't do that.
I don't remember anything.
Nothing.
You don't remember?
You killed them.

Don't ever forget.
And... make sure to recall... where Ha Yeon is.
No matter what happens.
Did I do that?
Did I really do that?
Did I?
President Cha, there is a call for you.
Hello?
Is that so?
Okay.

Okay.
I thought things were going well.
Did you hear about Inmate 3866?
He's giving up an appeal.
Is he giving up an appeal?
Yes, I was told to deliver the message.
I know that you won't make any mistakes.
Prosecutor, demand a sentence.
(Defendant)
(Day of First Trial)
- Prosecutor.

Your Honor.

The defendant was a prosecutor... and a head of a happy family.
But he broke it.
What are you talking about?
We all can't believe what he did.
He was supposed to... protect his family as a father and a husband.
I couldn't believe it, either.
However, with the explicit evidence we found out, we became convinced that he was the culprit of the horrible crime.
Then I made up my mind.
That I'd make him pay for what he'd done.
I don't remember anything.
What's going on?
I really don't remember anything.
The defendant who caused all the tragedies... still doesn't remember anything.
- Jun Hyuk.

- And so...

- That's not it.

- That's not true.

Get off me.

I don't remember anything.
Wait.

Jun Hyuk.
Jun Hyuk.
Jun Hyuk.
I don't remember anything.
I demand... the maximum penalty allowable by law,
What are you talking about, Jun Hyuk?
the death penalty... for the defendant.
Kang Jun Hyuk!

Jun Hyuk!

Gosh.

(Woljeong Prison)
Inmate 3866.
Are you okay now?

Yes.
Come on out.
Inmate 3866.

I'm coming.
Don't cause any more trouble and stop staying in a punishment cell.
This is just where people live.

I heard about you, Jeong Woo.
This is what you asked for.
(Appeal Waiver)
(Defendant Park Jeong Woo)
Jun Hyuk.
Do you remember what I said the other day?
What?
About why I am still alive.
Yes.
I want to find it out.
I want to find out why I'm still alive.
Jeong Woo.
I will see you at the second trial.
Why did you call yourself Bong Goo earlier?
What?

Mom called me Bong Goo.
I definitely engraved the name.
Why did I engrave it there?
Please calm down.

Don't cause any more trouble and stop staying in a punishment cell.
What on earth happened?
Inmate 3866, what are you doing?
Let's go.
Come this way.
Why aren't you coming?
Well, shouldn't I go to the punishment cell?
I see.
Your prosecutor friend is helping you out.
He asked me to take a good care of you.
Let's go to your cell.
Are you feeling better?
Yes.
Everyone went out to work.
Excuse me.
Were you here... when I first got here, Sir?
Well, I've been here for 20 years.

They said I lost my memory several times.
Do you happen to remember when I lost them?
There isn't much to do here.
Where did I put it?
I circled the dates in red.
(The day of Inmate 3866's first trial)
You had your first trial on that day.
It was after you were in the punishment cell for a week.
I heard you lost your memory on the morning of your first trial.
You worked out preparing for that trial.
They took it away from you and sent your to that cell.
- Who do you mean by they?

For some reason, they are not fond of you.

(Inmate 3866 lost his memory.)
Park Bong Goo.
Park Bong Goo.
Here!
Pass it.
I have to go to the punishment cell.

- Here it goes.

Kick it high.

- Throw it.

Here you go.
You know me, right?
You, jerk.
Have you gone mad after killing... your wife and daughter?
Let me go.
You, jerk.
Hey.
You, scumbag.
Let go of me.

Why is that jerk acting up?
I didn't do anything.

My gosh.
He's the crazy one.
- Come on.

What's going on?

I'm taking care of you a lot in just one day.

Take him to the punishment cell.
Yes, Sir.

You, crazy scumbag.

Let go of me.

Officer.
What?

I used to stay in the cell at the end.
This isn't a hotel.
Another inmate is in that cell.
You should stay in this one.
- Go in now.

Just go in.
Officer.
Officer.
Officer.
Officer.
Officer.

What's going on?
Inmate 3866 wants the cell at the end of the hallway.
The cell at the end?
Hey, you in the last cell.
Hey.

I'm eating.

You are loud.
- I have a favor.

- Yes.

Let me finish eating first and I will listen.
Goodness.
What do you want from me?
- The cell at the end?

The cell at the end of the hallway?
I get it now.

Let's go.

There should be letters engraved on the floor.
Can you tell me what it says?
Letters?
You're right.

Did you find it?

Yes, I did.

That sounds about right.

Let me see.
There are more.
Please.

The problem is...
I can't read.
What do you mean?

It... just happened,
Prosecutor Park Jeong Woo.
Who are you?
I'm heartbroken.
Both of us nearly died thanks to you.
Shin Cheol Sik.
Are you Shin Cheol Sik?
(We thank Seo Dong Won for his guest appearance.)
(Innocent Defendant)
Someone came to me that night.
Stop!

- What's going on?

You're pathetic.
Seon Ho, whom you liked, is gone now.
With which hand did you stab your wife?
- Are you crazy?

You're right.

You can't even remember.
If Jeong Woo didn't really lose his memory...
Why is everyone doing this to me?
I don't know how much to believe.
You remember where Ha Yeon is?
I'm sorry.
Did he really lose his memory?
I remember where I buried Ha Yeon now.
