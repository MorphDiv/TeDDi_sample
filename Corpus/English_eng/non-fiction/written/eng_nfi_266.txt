Where were you last employed?
I volunteered teaching literature to incarcerated men as part of the prison reform movement.
What was your last real job?
Well, I... was at a night school.
I taught English to immigrants.
For what reason were you made redundant?
It was a... a misunderstanding.
What kind of misunderstanding?
I felt that the school's curriculum tended to reinforce a servile bias towards the students, so I lobbied to make changes which were interpreted...
So you're a troublemaker.
I don't think we've got anything for you.
Okay.
You're here because you are black.
You're in this life because you were made in the image of your creator.
But when you're black and British, there's a constant struggle to understand who you really are.
We are the children of the colonies who built this Empire on the backs of their labor.
Strong in our pride... it's only when we came to what we built we were forced to question who we really are.
A countryman...
A countryman or just an interloper?
Now, when you decide that you're a citizen... when you stand up for what a citizen's due:
Decent housing, a good wage... it's the white man who claims you're not worthy.
And if you protest...
If you stand up and say you're owed what's yours, he treats you like a criminal.
And, like a criminal, he puts you in his prisons.
Turn round.
Tongue out.
Now, I don't blame the white man for his ways.
He's turned his back on righteousness.
Once given to the Devil, he does the Devil's work.
And just as I don't blame the white man...
I don't want nothing from the white man.
What we are due we'll get on our own.
We'll educate our own brothers and sisters.
We'll raise them, we'll be mindful of them.
If we're niggers to them, be 100% niggers 'cause 100% of us is more than a white man can handle.
Listen to the man.
Listen to what he come teach you.
Today we're reading from Dhari's own book - the memoirs of his struggle.
The Dragon Will Fly.
Turn to page 23.
The Reckoning.
"Let me make myself clear."
I do not seek the white man's approval.
For the white man's greatest trick is making us believe that we need him.
Forget the doctrine of good blacks that is being propagated by the racist right-wing press.
"Nothing ever came from being good."
The judge denied leave to appeal.
There's a new brief who wants to take up your case.
What happened to the other one?
They were all about the money?
Did the guards do that to you?
It's handled.
Look, Jas is right next door at the hospital.
And in here you've gotta be dying to get sent to the hospital.
Dying or dead.
Look...
Don't give up.
We're not giving up.
Okay?
Marcus!
Mar-cus!
Marcus!
Marcus!
Hi.
Have you heard this?
We're going to show them.
Yeah, we are gonna show them.
The rally will let everybody know what we're about.
Solidarity.
Us uniting as blacks and whites and we can do it peacefully.
But we have to do it definitely.
I don't want my kids to grow up in a world where they...
Our kids, our kids!
Our kids!
Well, you think I'm the best.
What are you about?
Nothing, everything, something.
Just having a laugh.
Look, we're just on our way home.
You talk like you're pissed up.
Do you want to get yourself nicked?
No-one's talking to you.
Fuck off, you gobshite.
Oi!
You got something to say, you Irish fucking cunt?
They... swing oppression like a club and they call it the law.
This growing police brutality is exactly why we need to keep fighting for Dhari's appeal.
Now is when we need new leaders.
With this Immigration Act sitting before Parliament...
It's jail, it's crime.
Prison reform - that's all we talk about.
What kind of message does that send?
What does that say about us?
And we know where it's coming from.
This is what stops us from getting work.
Educating prisoners is how we fight.
You cool?
I don't know.
Are you coming?
Julian, yeah?
What are his intentions?
What are his intentions?
Got no intentions.
He wants to stand up to the National Front but he wants it to go off civil and all that.
Julian's not looking for any trouble.
No trouble.
Julian, he talks a mile of shit about how he's up for the cause but all the while having himself a fuckabout with that Irish bitch of his.
Sister's not good enough.
I'm not selling anybody out.
It's for the cause.
I'm just trying to protect the cause.
I don't really care why you're doing it.
Just get it done.
The penal system's just slavery by another name, enforced through illiteracy.
The Establishment knows that the simplest way for people to liberate themselves is through education.
What?
I feel it and I... miss it.
And how are you spending your time?
Sounds typically arty of you.
It's not arty.
Coming to the rally?
Er...
It's standing up against the Immigration Act.
They're trying to turn us into non-patrials, kick us out of the country we built.
I wish I had my camera.
Why?
You look lovely.
That was always your problem.
Don't like compliments, then?
How's your mum?
Does she talk about me much?
No.
How's your dad?
Never heard back.
I don't know if he wasn't answering or the jailers weren't giving him the letters.
You should definitely keep writing to him.
I think it's really important that he knows that his daughter still misses him.
I mean, that would break my heart.
I have to go.
Marcus wants to do things.
I have to be with someone who wants to do things.

Black and white, unite and fight!
Black and white, unite and fight!
Black and white, unite and fight.
Come on!
Get in there!
Black and white, unite and fight.
Watch it!
This is not how it needs to be done.
Fucking hell!
Im sorry for your mate.
The truth is, he never really stood a chance.
The police, they just rolled in...
That weren't the police.
Julian organized that protest.
If they went at him like you said, that was the Black Power Desk.
Is that Special Branch?
It's the hard heart of Special Branch.
Cops from South Africa, Rhodesia.
Train them to be thugs over there, then bring them back here to go at black radicals, the troublemakers.
They're the ones that put that on Julian.
I've never heard of the Black Power Desk.
Well, ain't that the point?
Go paint some signs?
March up and down the footpath?
Protest, counter-protest.
The whole Civil Rights thing has been a failure.
You think you're free but you're not.
CS gas, shoot-to-kill.
It's coming to Brixton and Notting Hill.
To the people with the guns goes the power.
Maybe next time we can build a fire engine or an ambulance or something, ja?
Would you like that?
Good boy.
That boy you found me, he was a good one.
Keep it up.
Very good.
A few more, okay?
OPEC leaders concluded the meeting without indicating they would either increase oil production or be willing to consider price controls.
Timothy Leary, the wanted fugitive, once described by Richard Nixon as the most dangerous man in America, has recently been spotted in Switzerland.
Leary has been on the run since September 1970, after a prison break, orchestrated by the militant.
Weather Underground Organization.
They arranged transport for Leary to Algeria, where he was given safe haven by the black radical Eldridge Cleaver.
According to the FBI, Leary's escape was funded by the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, a dangerous network of drug users based in Orange County, California.
You know what we have to do.
You know.
And it starts with Dhari.
Dhari's in prison.
Meinhof sprung Baader from prison.
The fucking Brotherhood of Eternal Love got Timothy Leary out.
That's not who we are, Jas!
Then who are we?
What are we about, Marcus?
You and I are drifting apart.
Hey, how is this about our relationship?
If we're up for something, if we're up for each other, now's when we've got to show it.
They fit us up, they killed Julian and there's nothing we can do.
We need a soldier who can take the fight to the filth.
You don't get to shame me into doing something mental, Jas.
Well, you said...
Yes, and people shouted me down.
Because that's all they do!
All the speeches, the empty rhetoric.
They smoke some weed, talk like Che and fuck whatever's in front of them.
They do nothing.
Okay, erm...
If... if we could, you know, get Dhari out of prison...
Hey, Jas, Jas.
If we could get him out, well, then what?
When Dhari's free, people will take notice.
When he talks, they listen and when he points his finger at the belly of the beast, we'll know exactly where to cut it.
Whatever happens next, it starts with getting Dhari out of prison.
He's a political prisoner.
He's engaged in the common fight.
What did he do?
Stabbed a man robbing an off-license.
He's a punk.
Look, tell 'em to be straight with me.
Can't help him if he's not straight.
Show him the photos.
I know what it looks like.
Your man's in C-wing.
That's where they keep the punks.
Won't have as many eyes on him as A- and B-wing but that doesn't make things any easier.
They tightened security since Blake went over the wall.
You're gonna have to get him out shooting.
You better really want him out 'cause things are likely to get bloody.
I'd want... five men at least.
What in the hell would you two be good for?
I'd want five on the outside and I'd be needing to pay off at least two inside.
Need a car, enough money to go...
How much?
What, are you looking for charity?
I don't give a fuck about your politics.
We don't have anything close to that.
Well, you must have something.
What do you have?
We might...
Well, I could get you £75.
For 100 I could get you a gun but it'd be a right shitty one.
Well, we tried, Jas.
Can I trust you?
Can I trust you?
Direct symbolic action.
What does that mean?
We're going to liberate a political prisoner.
You're going to bust a convict out of prison.
Is that what you're saying?
Well, he's doing things for your people.
You call me arty!
He's just some unemployed English teacher that's sold you on the theatre of revolution.
Jas, he's using your guilt for your father to make you do something really stupid.
This was my idea, Kent.
It's still your guilt talking.
You don't want to break out a political prisoner.
You wanna break your father out.
Jas...
I'm really sorry about what happened to your friend.
No.
You weren't even at the rally.
You couldn't even show up to support.
Someone to show you there is actually a way out.
They're changing the laws on us.
One day, people are gonna ask us what we did.
I'm not gonna tell them I sat on a fence.
What do you do?
I'd be very interested in a placement in university education.
Not that I wouldn't consider something at a secondary school.
I have a degree in...
Do you have a driving license?
I could get you something in transport straightaway.
Now, if you can't drive, there's a desperate need for porters but you seem like one of the smart ones and I'd like to get you something good.
Can you drive, then?
Further escalation of the conflict in Vietnam,
President Nixon insisted the action was consistent with his desire to achieve peace with honor.
Rhodesian diplomats are expected to visit London in the coming weeks to meet with the Conservative Party Monday Club.
The Monday Club are vocal supporters...
It is speculated that Rhodesian officials are seeking aid in their ongoing war against ZANLA and ZANU, which are fighting to overturn white rule within a sovereign nation.
Marcus?
What are you doing?
Everything okay?
They're bringing me ones.
It's all there.
It's all there.
Are you cool?
Or would you feel better if we had help?
You know.
You know what I'm saying?
No, no, no!
What's your emergency?
We've got a black male from Wormwood Scrubs.
He's here.
Hiya.
I was wondering if you could give me a hand, please.
I was here about 30 minutes ago and I...
I think I might have dropped my...
Do you know what's at your head?
Please, I got a wife...
What you've got to worry about is his...
Because you're going to be...
You are right but you have to walk.
Brian?
Marcus.
You're okay.
Get Dhari.
Keep moving.
You shot him.
Keep moving.
She's better than I deserve.
Just put it back.
I told you not to talk to him.
I never... never wanted kids but she wants them so bad.
You know he's going straight to the coppers, right?
Give me the fucking gun!
Jas!
Fuck.
I know somewhere we can hide out.
How long has she worked here?
Thank you.
It was her and her boyfriend.
Come on.
Hey, how close are the pigs?
They're my English teachers.
He does English, she's a nurse.
I need water.
What's up with your ass, man?
He... he's got some anal tears.
You should've seen this brother.
Shot a man.
Hey!
You two, you dig where you're at now, right?
Things is real, you hear how I'm saying?
No going back on nothing 'cause all your other shit is gone.
You're soldiers now.
God!
(RADIO The gunmen apparently forced their way into a hospital, firing their weapons and taking hostages before escaping with the convict.
The well-timed, well-planned breakout is similar to the prison escape of Andreas Baader, largely coordinated by Ulrike Meinhof.
No one has yet claimed responsibility for the action.
However, initially its scope and scale suggest the action was taken by Poqo, a South African terrorist organization linked to the Black Panthers.
At this point, officials are unsure if the escape is an isolated incident, or the first in what may be a coming wave of black radicalism in the face of new immigration laws before Parliament.
One MP has been quoted as saying that under the circumstances, all coloreds must be considered suspect.
The Home Secretary responded with the following statement:
"This recent incidence of colored terrorism"
shows the necessity of
"a strengthened migration policy."
In response, a series of police raids have been carried out in Brixton and Notting Hill, in a show of force not easily recalled.
Blacks, for years, have complained about aggressive police tactics that have led to false arrests and physical abuses under the cover of authority.
The expectation is for a continuing escalation of tensions between police and the colored communities of Greater London.
You cool?
We're so fucking cool.
