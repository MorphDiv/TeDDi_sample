When you fly above New York at night it's like you're looking down at millions of stars.
And each star could be the life of a person who calls this great city home.
My dad told me that people have always looked at the patterns of the stars to predict what was going to happen in their lives, and if you could understand those patterns, you'd be able to know what was gonna happen
before anyone else did.
The last time we saw each other he told me that each star's light has taken decades to reach us and how it always burns brightest right before it dies.
So now, whenever a distant star lights up,
I always feel like somewhere, somehow, someone's life is about to end.
The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
I've missed you.
Stop it right there!

Ever had a dream that felt real?
So real, you thought you were awake.
Tonight, new yorkers have the opportunity to see a highly unusual event above our city.
Ashley gains reports.
For the next two weeks, we will be able to witness a star going Nova.
The distant star, known as hamil, actually died 30 years ago but it has taken that long for the light to reach us, so that...
- Morning, Nicky.

Taxi?
Hey!
- You sure about that?

Alright!
This is a non-rockaway-bound a train.
I like order.

Even in the stressful world of air traffic control.
For me, it's a game to find order in the chaos.
AA 7349, wind 360 at 15.
Line up runway 4 Left, clear for take-off.
Good day to you, sir.

Good day right back at you, sir.
A lot of metal in the air today, people.
Let's focus, alright?

Okay, here's the first lot of 10 downstairs that are going to be jammed up for the next half-hour.
I know you love a bit of chaos.
EA 39, square the base, reduce to minimum speed now.

Don't make me look bad.
You send that metal bitch around and you owe 10 bucks to the drinking fund.

UA 39 lands.
Damn!
Attaboy.
Okay, we all know that he never comes out.
But the poor bastard's about to turn 30 in two weeks and god knows when we'll lure him out for another drink.
Here's to the end of youth, pal.
We love you, dyl.
I don't.
Thanks, you guys.
Especially inky for those incredibly moving words.
I'm a sentimental guy.
Who's up for a smoke?
You talked me into it.
Bill?
Hey, I thought you'd quit.
Yeah, I did.

- Bill!

You wanna get some air?
Sure.
So, happy birthday.
Really?
It's one of those?
So, our tradition continues,
You bet it does.
Aerial ballet?
Is that something you can't handle?
It's fine.
- Great.

- And you're coming with me.

- Why not?

Well, I'm...

Who is quite normal.

Guess we were never right for each other, were we?
No, not even close.
Seriously, who am I supposed to bring to this thing?
I don't know.
But I hope you find her one day.
They say people are unpredictable.
But really, we all love routine.
- Morning, Nicky.

Me?

Patterns in everyday routines.
Astrological experts have not seen such intense activity...
Can I help you?

Hey, people, come on.

I want you to get yankee the hell out of there.
Dylan!
Tell him to pull up!
SA 841, clear to land.
Clear to land.

My god!
Wicked!
My god!
Can someone, anyone, please respond?
GA 950...
Your father was a pilot.
Retired air force, yes.
You graduated top of your class at nyu.
It was a great day for my dad.
You got your pilot's license, so why are you landing commercial jets and not flying them like he did?
Because I'm not him.
I only aced those tests because they were based on a rotating series of algorithmic patterns.
You see patterns?
I guess.
But just not today.
You're suspended, pending a full board review.
How long?
Four weeks and a board review.
I'm sorry, dyl.
- It could have been worse.

I almost killed 900 people.
Emirates 433.
What are you doin'?
The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
Your attention, please.
Safety is our first priority.
Please remain calm.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
There you go.
Thank you.
Hey, maybe next time you can try the one with the dancing mice and the fairies.
The nutcracker.
Yeah, that one.
- I'm Dylan.

Did you enjoy the aerial ballet?
Yeah, I loved it.
It was incredible.
You seem surprised.
It's my first time at the ballet.
A friend kind of dared me to go.
Would you like a drink?
Or not.
I'd prefer to get out of here...
Actually.
With me?
Yeah.
That's great!
I'm Sarah... in case you wanted to know my name.
Well, I kinda wanted to know.
Come on.
- So your first time?

Wasn't what I expected.
No bulging tights.
Mercifully no.
It was more... more epic.
Or... intimate.
Or... both.
Yeah, or both.

You know, it kind of reminded me of this feeling I'd get as a kid.
I'd wait until everyone had gone to bed, and then I'd climb on to the roof to look at the stars.
Because my dad was a pilot, so whenever I saw a flashing star,
I'd pretend it was him flying across the sky and I knew he'd be looking down at me.
And if I was really lucky,
I'd see a shooting star and I'd wish he'd come home.
I love that.
Did you ever want to do that?
Yeah.
- Yeah?

Okay.

Because I'm afraid to fly.
- Really?

Scared to death.
Right.
Tell me something about you.

I work at the Howard Pace Gallery downtown.
Totally would have guessed that.
No!

Well, it's funny.

I don't know, I never saw myself working in an art gallery.
Well, what did you want to be?
A dancer.
The other day at work, I made a mistake.
I lost my flow.
And... you know, there was... there was one plane that was about to land, and another one about to take off.
Something happened.
I nearly killed 900 people.
The plane that was coming in...
What flight was it?
As841 from O'Hare.
Are you okay?
That was my flight.
What?
I was on that flight.
I...

No.

Sorry, guys.

No.
- Can we get one more drink?

I know we only just met, but doesn't it...
Feel like we've known each other forever?
I was actually going to say it feels a little more intense than your typical first date.
I had a really good time tonight.
- How are you doing?

Did you want to help me out, or...?
You know, you're not actually creating the art.
You're just doing the background.
It's all about the background, Sarah.
Okay.
Major rendering meltdown.
Howard, stop texting me.
Jonas!

I'm trying to create and you're stressing me out.
Well, just make it incredible.
Because art is that easy.
Okay.

I suppose you want a coffee too?
Soy latte with an extra shot?
Thank you.
Don't worry about me, guys.

How was it?

It was beautiful.

Yeah, it was...

It wasn't anything religious, but...
Bullshit - it was religious.
You're glowing.
Thank you.
Okay!
It looks good.
Emirates 443.
Hello?
Hello.

Yeah?
Is this Dylan Branson of 818 east 12th street?
Hey!

You cut me off!
I can't believe this shit!
Are you kidding me?
I'm cruising down my bike Lane and you come clip me off?
Pick up your bike and get on your way.
I'm sorry.

Regina Jones from Grand Central.
Yep.

- It's your lucky day.

The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
I've missed you.
Bobby, stay in line!
The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
Please remain calm.
Hi.
I'm sorry.

Hi.
God, that looked so much better when I picked it.
It actually had petals.
- Okay.

No, no, no, no!
I want it.

It... it... it smells great.
Hey, would you like to do dinner again?
I...
It's a little early, don't you think?
So do you want the short story or the long?
- No, short.

- I don't got all day.

Well, I started dancing when I was seven...
And for me, it was really kind of the only thing that really, like, felt like me, you know?
And halfway through my senior year,
I got offered an apprenticeship at the New York City ballet...
Which of course I took.
Six months into being there, I...
I landed awkwardly on a jump that I had done a hundred times before...
And I busted my knee.
I shredded two ligaments.
- And...
I don't know.

You know what?
Stuff like that...
I think it all happens for a reason.
If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.

- The paper?

Watch this.
I guess I'm the pilot that can't fly.
You're the dancer that can't dance.
Or can you?
- What?

What are you doing?
What does it look like?
So come and help me out.
Come on, just don't leave me standing here.
- Come on.

- Come on.

Wait.
I don't think I'm ready for this.
Come on.
You see it?
What time do you work today?
Three hours ago.
Yeah.
What's this?
This?
It's pretty.
Thanks.

A friend made it for me for my birthday.
A friend?
A boyfriend.
- An ex-boyfriend.

- That's good.

- That's the good news.

He's actually...
I don't think you're going to like this very much, but...
He is actually the artist who's showing at the gallery.
I love it.

It's great.
I just better make sure I do something that competes.
- Okay.

Next week.

Are you kidding?
No.

- 18th?

- What year?

No, seriously?

- Yes!

- 1986.

- That's my birthday.

- I swear.

- I swear.

I swear!
We're both turning 30 next week.
I don't believe you.
You're a liar.
Hell!

Do you have eyes?
- Can you drive?

- It doesn't matter!

Why were you in the road?
That's the third day in a row.
Sarah, question.
- Too much?

Are we good to do tech checks?
Do I look like we're good to do tech checks?
Jonas, we open Friday night.

It'll be ready.
Why do you always do this to me?
Because you love it.
Okay, I'm bored now.
You smell good.
- It's the pheromones.

She's in love.
No, she's not in love.
She's definitely in lust.
Guys, stop!
You are, aren't you?
I don't want to talk about it.
We are not even close to being ready.
I'm happy for you.
No, you're not.
Just hope he knows how lucky he is.
Come on!
Yeah, I've seen them, you know.
Hey, man, why didn't you stop?
Which way are you going?
No worry.

Yeah.
- No.

Don't go this way, okay?
We're heading towards Grand Central.
- No, is good.

Just stop the cab.
What your problem?
- Just stop the cab, okay?

Stop the cab and let me out, please!
No yelling!

Okay.

Okay, pull!
Hey, buddy... you okay?
Hey, let me help you out.
Hey, somebody call an ambulance!
Hey.
Take this off.
This is going to sound ridiculous, okay?
But I...

A businessman reads a newspaper.
The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
A couple hugs.
I've missed you.
There's...
And these kids are crossing the concourse.
One drops something.
For three days in a row, a pregnant woman under the clock.
It's...
At exactly 2:22.
Boom.
Your attention, please.
Your safety is our first priority.
Please remain calm.
You're okay.
Taxi?
- Morning, Nicky.

Every little thing matters.
A drop of water.
A dead bug.
A plane flies overhead at 11:15.
It's all part of some kind of pattern.
- Can I help you with that?

Step back!
GA 554, taxi, papa, November, Alpha.
I think I'm losing it.
They're shrinks.

Yeah, things are happening to me, Inky.
Things that cannot possibly be explained.
What can I do?
I don't know.
Nothing.
Call me, yeah?
Yeah.
We'll do something on your birthday.
Only three days left, Dyl.
Make the most of 'em.
"9:10.

Not today.
Drip?
Really?
Drip!
Three, two...
What the fuck?
The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
I've missed you.
Hey, there you are.
Yep.
Alright, can I lead you over to...
You can tell me what you think.
Have you seen him?
- No, okay.

- Lovely to meet you.

Ladies and gentlemen, we're all here to experience the work of one of our most exciting contemporary artists...
Mr. Jonas Edman, with his latest tribute to this great city.
Tonight I present you the opening of... convergence.
Hi.
Hi.
Excuse me, ladies.
Sarah.
- Let's go.

- We're good to go.

Okay.

- Showtime.

Dylan, this is Jonas.
Hi.
Hi.
Okay.
Ready?
Three, two, one... go.
Nothing is as eternal as a city.
And you are my eternal love the city of all cities.
Pavemented, walled, lit, jeweled.
Crowded city of beauty.
Of shadows and geometric shapes never ending.
Your windows reflect memories none of us can keep.
Moments, they slip away, a whisper in our sleep.
The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
Your arms hold the sky, reflecting in truth.
Where god and men meet in our reverence to you.
Is this some kind of sick joke?
What?
What are you doing?

- What is this?

How long have you been doing this?
- What is going on here, man?

- Dylan!

What is this?

Jonas!
- Why would you do this?

Hey, hey, hey!

Let go of me!

What are you doing?
Stop.
Bravo.

I love this, Jonas.
A nice morbid tale to button the exhibit.
I have another amazing interpretation in my gallery, you know.
What?
I love how you blended the victims in so elegantly.
A moment before the murders.
It's really stunning.
What is he talking about?
I have no idea.
The photograph...

Come on, time to leave.
What is wrong with you?
What is that?
You know Jonas is the most important artist in this exhibit.
Yes, and he's your ex-boyfriend.
How... how's this possible?
That hologram is the exact replica of what I've been seeing.
This is crazy.
How is this possible?
How does he know?
You know, I can't actually have this conversation right now.
Let yourself out.
- Sarah.

Yeah, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened.
Dylan, this is Jonas.
The energetic force of the exploding Hamlin will be at its greatest in the next two days.
This is a very rare event...
The massive lifespan of the average star.
"Jake Redmond."
Letters to this address.
"My dear Jake,"
I just got your letter
"and I can't stop grinning from ear to ear."
Sarah, it's Dylan.
I'm so sorry about last night.

This thing with Jonas and the hologram just really got to me.
Please call me, okay?
The next stop is Grand Central.
Grand Central.
Thought you might drop by.
So there's the killer with the gun in his hand.
He shot a woman and a police detective in broad daylight before he was gunned down by the cops.
A tourist from Cleveland took the original photograph...
And the artist has taken that image and...
Created this piece.
Stay as long as you like.
"Multiple homicides at grand central."
"... criminal Jake Redmond."
No, not it.
Here it is.
The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
"Jake redmond.
Born April 18th 1956."
Who is it?
It's Dylan Branson.
We spoke over the phone.
I'll buzz you in.
Where did you get these?
In my apartment.
They were hidden.
And why did you come here?
I don't know.
I feel a connection to her.
You want to talk about connection?
She was my sister.
She was the kindest person.
She had a voice like an angel and she sang at clubs all around town and that's where she met Jake.
She thought he was...
Funny and clever and sweet.
Newspapers said he was a convicted criminal.
He was never convicted.
The police had to say that to save face.
I still don't know what he was up to.
It was some kind of...
Insurance scams or racketeering, something like that.
And everyone tried to warn her... the police, her friends and that poor detective who died with her.
- Noah marks.

I think he was in love with her, too.
She had that effect on men.

She believed that Jake was the love of her life.
Did Jake love her the same way back?
Well, apparently enough to kill her rather than let her go.
Is that was she was doing at grand central?
Was she leaving him?
Detective Marks came to see Evie one night.
He told her things about Jake that she never knew.
He was a violent man.
He'd killed a police informer.
She kept saying, "I don't believe it.
Jake would never hurt anyone."
She said they were destined to be together.
Even had the same birthday.
He said Jake was a psycho, that he was dangerous.
And detective marks said that...
He had a place, somewhere up in...
Millhurst.
The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
Yeah.

This is what we found after she...
Take them.
I could never bear to read them.
This is all I need to remember her by.
The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
Hey, Sarah,
I really need to talk to you.
These patterns, the things I'm seeing, the hologram...
Us, everything... it's all connected.
Please, call me.
For over a week now, he's ended up right here at Grand Central.
What made you do this?
It's Grand Central.
It's iconic New York.
I've been working on this thing for eight months, way before you met your...

The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
Yeah, but the same people.
I mean, the... the businessman, the couple hugging...
Hey, I've missed you.
The school children... the pregnant woman.
He... he sees them.

The same people.

The same people?
The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
Well, not the exact same people but the...
I don't know, the same type of people.
He... he thinks it's a pattern.
Seriously?
A businessman in a train station is a pattern?
I don't know.
You know what they call people who see patterns in everything?
- Hi.

Yeah, um...
The Millhurst Express.
Bit of news for you.
The Millhurst Express...
Ain't run for nearly three decades now.
What?
The Poughkeepsie Express is now boarding on track 32.
Look out!
Your attention please.
Your safety is our first priority.
Please remain calm.
Thanks for coming.
Hey, I'm tired and...
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'm so sorry.
Hey.

Are you okay?
What's really going on?
I know what this looks like.
I get it.
How long have you been doing this?
Just a couple of days.
Well... since the day at JFK, really.
It was like I saw the sky cracking open.
I saw right through it.
Now look at this.
His name's Jake Redmond, right?
He was a killer.

- I see.

She was a singer.
And they died at grand central 30 years ago tomorrow, the day you and I were born.
We're them.
- No.

Look.

I wrote these letters to you.
And you...
Wrote these to me.
A lifetime ago.
Look.

Look at them.
It's all happening again.
- No, I...

- I...

I don't...

Your patterns...
These letters...
They don't mean anything.
They mean everything.

No, you need to understand.
It is Grand Central.
I could go there any time of day and find these people if that's what I was looking for.
All these patterns that you think exist...
They're just people.
No.
You live in a city of 8 million.
Of course they're going to be doing similar things.
You hear that?
Dog barking.
Telephone ringing.
Airplane.

Car horn.
Car horn.
It is New York City and it is all happening.
It is all happening, all of the time.
Please don't do this.
Please.
When I'm with you I feel something so special.
Just stop it.
Don't you get it?
She dies.

This is us.
We die tomorrow, Sarah.
We need to end this now for your own good.
No.
We can not see each other again.
- Don't do this to us.

Please go.
Can I help you?
The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
I've missed you.
Can I help you with that?
Yeah?
Hey, it's me.
I need to know why Grand Central.
You both have this connection.
It's a coincidence.
He doesn't believe in that.
Or therapy, apparently.
Sarah, this has to stop.
You can't keep doing this to us.
To yourself.

It's destructive.
I'm going to take you away for a few days.
You saw the way he looked at me.
He wanted to kill me.
He is out of control, Sarah.
You're not safe here.
I mean it.
I love him.
I love him so much.
I don't know what it is, we just have this connection.
Constellations.
A map of the heavens.
Electromagnetic shifts in the earth's atmosphere.
Einstein's theory of relativity...
Happy birthday.
Scientists believe the electromagnetic field around the earth is being affected by the supernova from the dying star, Hamil.
So more and more we're able to confirm just how alive and effectible our world truly is.
Even an exploding star 30 light years away causes our planet to adjust and react as its light actually reaches us.
Science is starting to...
What am I missing?
What appears to be a star dying to us now actually happened 30 years ago.
So when we look into the distant night sky we are not just seeing the reaches of the universe, we are quite literally looking back in time itself.
Back in time.
Can I help you with that?
The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
I've missed you.
I'm seeing the day I die.
- Hey.

You good?
Yeah.
JFK, please.
A woman laughs.
Can I help you with that?
Can I help you with that?
Thank you.

Bell.
Follow the bell.
Door slams.
Hey.
A couple of days in Millhurst will do you wonders.
Sarah.
No.
Jonas.
You're Noah marks.
Just don't answer it.
Sarah, where are you?

Shit.
What?
Our flight's been cancelled.
Change of plan.

Siren.
2:15.

Alright, swinging it back.
Gonna get the tickets.
Meet you at the clock.
Okay.
The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
Car horn.
Hey!

Sir!
Sir, get down off the vehicle!
Sarah, where are you?
I know what the patterns are.
I'm seeing the day we die.
Two tickets to Millhurst please.
What?
Millhurst.
30 years ago maybe.
Poughkeepsie will get you there.
That'll be $52.
Poughkeepsie.
Hands behind your back, sir.
Okay.
2:17.

Why you jumping on the car?
Sir, just stop right there.
Put your hands behind your back...
- People are gonna die, man!

Give me the hands.
Come on!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Right, drop the weapon!
Okay, okay.
That's it.

- I'm warning you.

- Put the weapon down.

Three.
Two.
One.
Heads down!

There we go.
Two tickets to Poughkeepsie.
I thought you said we were going to Millhurst.
What are you talking about?
You ready?
I'm sorry.
Wait, what's wrong?
- Take your hands off me.

Stay away from me.
Stop!
You love me, Evelyn.
You just called me Evelyn.
But you love me.
I don't.
- Say it.

Say it!
- Tell me you love me!

Sarah!
You brought him here?
You brought him here?
A businessman.
A businessman.
The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
A couple hugs.
A couple hugs.
I missed you.
There's always a row of schoolchildren.
And a pregnant woman...
Standing under the clock.
Get out of here!
She'll never be yours.
No!
God!

No!
Put the weapon down!
Freeze!

The Millhurst Express is now boarding on track 32.
The Poughkeepsie Express is now boarding on track 32.
Boom.
No!
No!

No.
A star shines brightest right before it dies.
God.
The sun's coming out for us.
- I want more of you.

All these years, history said Jake was a murderer, when in fact he was framed by the cops to protect their own.
And in the end, only love could reveal the truth.
"My dear Jake,".
I just got your letter and I can't stop smiling from ear to ear.
I don't understand why I'm feeling... the way I am so quickly.
I just never believed a love like this was possible."
Hi.
It's 2:23.
We made it.
So as expected, the dying star Hamlin did finally disappear.
But somewhere, somehow another star was born right after.
Dad's predictions all those years ago did finally play out.
He was right when he said in everyone's life there comes a time or, in my case, many times...
When the universe opens itself for just a few moments to show us what's truly possible.
11:15.
No plane.
