(WAVES SPLASHING)
("'TIS THE GIFT TO BE SIMPLE" PLAYING ON CELL PHONE)
Yes, we received your payment.
No, it wasn't late, but it was for $78.13, and the bill was for $78.31.
Okay, great.
No, thank you.

I think it's the intake manifold.
- Was I right?

I think I just like saying "intake manifold."
Maybe when I get a job, I'll get Triple A.
I thought you worked at the water company.
Temping.
- How's your parents?

I should, um, get going, actually, for dinner.
But, um, we should make a plan.

Or we could do that now since we're both here.
- What?

Okay.
(CAR DOOR SLAMS)
("SOMETHING OLD SOMETHING NEW" PLAYING)
MAN:

I always thought you two would make a good...
- Mom.

Boy from the neighborhood?
That would've been cute.
(LAUGHS)
Remember when he fixed the roof?
- Stop.

- He's not...

Mm.
Any word on the insurance?
Oh, they won't cover the cost of IGIV.

So, you know, surprise, surprise.

DAD:

Come on, honey.
- Help me up.

- Here.

Thanks, Mae.
- MOM:

- (DAD GRUNTS)

Well, not so fast.
(DAD GRUNTS)
- MOM:

- MOM:

- Yeah.

("'TIS THE GIFT TO BE SIMPLE" PLAYING ON CELL PHONE)
(PEOPLE CHATTING)
- WOMAN:

I come here each day and in return, I receive money to buy goods and services.
Ah, well, I've got to be quick.

- Why are you in Germany?

Those guys did not screw around, but listen, I got you an interview.
- What?

- (SCREAMS) - (LAUGHING) Yes, I did.
Really?

(LAUGHING) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I did, tomorrow.
Holy shit, Annie, I love you.
ANNIE:

So answer phones, help people, what you're already doing but now a real company.
I know, it's perfect.
Tons of people started there.
MAE:

Stop saying that.

- One of them may as well be you.

This doesn't mean you're in.

Know the Circle inside out.

By then, you'll be hired if you kill the interview.
MAE:

ANNIE:

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
MAN:

- your grandmother?

It combined everything that was separate and sloppy into one account.
No more forgetting your password, multiple identities, identity theft.
You use your real name, which is tied to your credit card.
I think Grandma's falling asleep.
(SCOFFS)
Okay.
Before True You, it was like you needed a different vehicle for every single one of your errands, and no one should have to own 87 different cars.
It doesn't make sense.
It's the chaos of the Web made elegant and simple.
Speed round.

Early Paul, late John.
- Mario or Sonic?

Introspection or communication?
- Uh...

- Sorry, I'm thinking about it.

- Sushi or Soylent?

Ever owned a Velcro wallet?
- Yes.

- Yes.

Yes.
What was the name of the receptionist who checked you in this morning?
Um...
- Linda.

- Joan Didion.

(CHUCKLES) I'm not answering that.

Would you like to go out with me?
That's very inappropriate.
Good.

Not mutually exclusive.
Needs of the society or needs of the individual?
- Should be the same.

Unfulfilled potential.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
All right, heliport, gym, daycare,
- organic farm, Pétanque.

- Oh, it's like bocce but French. (GIGGLES)

Tetherball, lap pool, social pool, doga.
- (DOG BARKING) - (INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
Kennel, nightclub, salon, maker space, rock climbing, trampoline, clinic, volleyball.
Was that...?

Content people, news, arts, film, engineers, management and me, advertising and you.
All right, let's go.
MAE:

(SHOUTS) What?
(GIGGLES) It's all on sensors.
The elevator reads your ID and says "hello."
We do that for visitors mostly.

Annie, that's the worst picture of me ever.
Oh, come on...

- ANNIE:

You remember Dan?

- You're all grown-up.

DANNY:

And I sent the password to your phone.
- Oh, my God.

Oh, this is too sad.

- I will.

MAN:

Jared will be doing your training.
I oversee the team, and Jared oversees the unit.
As you know, you'll be doing straight-up customer maintenance for the smaller advertisers.
You work on your portable here.
They send a message to customer experience, and it gets routed over to one of you.
Random at first, but once you start working with a customer, they'll continue to be routed over to you for the sake of continuity.
Um, you get the query, figure out the answer, you write them back, and that is the core of it.
Simple enough in theory.

- (CHUCKLES) Uh, yeah.

So let's say you've answered a client's question, and they seem satisfied.
Now, it's not just that you get a smile or a frown, though that is part of it.
You get your smile...

Um, that is when you send the survey.
The survey is a set of quick questions about, you know, your overall service, how you did, and they send that immediately back, and you get to see how you did right here.

Let's just do a live one.
- Excuse me.

- Okay.

- Have a nice day.

(TAPS)
- (HUMMING) - (BEEPS)
That's pretty good, 99 is good, but I can't help wondering why it wasn't 100.

(BEEPS)
Okay.
(TYPES)
Boom.

So it's important to ask them and make sure you get that clarity.
And we're back to a perfect score, yeah.
- Oh, wow.

All right, are you ready to do this on your own?
- (CHUCKLES) Yes.

(TYPING)
(BEEPS)
ANNIE:

Hey, how's it going?
- I thought you were in Amsterdam.

Then London, then New York, now here.
- Have you slept?

A couple pills, I'm good.

- (GROANS)

You got an 87 average.
- That's like a solid B.

Listen, when I first started, it took me a few weeks to really get the hang of it.

Believe me, you're doing fine.

Mm-hm.
Hello, I'm Eamon Bailey.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(CHUCKLES) Hey.
(APPLAUSE CONTINUES)
Thank you, thank you.

Now a bunch of you are new to the company since I last spoke, so can the guppies all stand up?
- ANNIE:

- Whoo!

Congratulations, nice to have you.
Now "guppies" is just an affectionate term for you baby fishies.
Soon you will all grow to become powerful...
- (LAUGHS) You're adorable.

The fish that guppies grow up into being...
- What do they grow up into?

Anyway, all right, this is Dream Friday, the latest in our long tradition of presenting our newest innovations.
The first Dream Friday featured Ty Lafitte, the inventor of True You and our founding father.
And usually, we feature one of our engineers or our visionaries but today unfortunately, it's just me and for that,
- I apologize in advance.

- (ANNIE CHUCKLES)

Thanks, Mom.
(LAUGHTER)
Now you might not have seen me around campus for the last few days, and maybe you were wondering just where the heck I've been.
WOMAN:

- (LAUGHTER)

- (GIGGLES)

And that's part of what I'm here to talk about.
I love to surf and in the past,
I would have to wake up and call the local surf shop to ask about the local breaks, and pretty soon, the local surf shop stopped answering their phone.
- (LAUGHTER)

(LAUGHTER)
And then came... the Internet.
- (AUDIENCE CHEERING)

Some geniuses set up cameras on the beaches, so I could log on and get some very crude images of the waves at Stinson Beach.
It was almost worse than calling the surf shop.
Here's how it used to look.
(AUDIENCE GROANING)
Almost useless, right?
But now let's refresh that page and show the site with our new Circle video delivery.
- (AUDIENCE MURMURING)

Yeah, maybe I should be out there right now.
- (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

(AUDIENCE GASPING)
This camera needs no wires.
It transmits this image via satellite.
I set up that camera this morning.
I stuck it to a tree near the dunes with no permit, nothing, in fact, no one even knows it's there.
And actually, I was pretty busy this morning because here's Rodeo Beach, Montera,
Ocean Beach,
Fort Point.
This is my front yard.
(LAUGHTER)
- And here's my backyard.

Here's traffic on the 101.
Oh, did you think this was just a camera?
No, welcome to real time analytic processing.
When you see this, you're also getting this.
(AUDIENCE MURMURING)
Air quality, traffic volume, weather patterns, biometrics, facial recognition, saved and searchable, all to serve you better.
My friends, we are looking at retailing these in just a few months for less than a pair of jeans.
- (AUDIENCE MURMURS)

I'm talking about the ones like I'm wearing.
WOMAN:

Now, Circlers... do you like to share?
ALL:

Sharing is caring.

- Sharing is caring?

I have a dozen helpers all over the world right now carrying these cameras.
Imagine the human rights implications.
Activists no longer have to hold up a camera.
Now it's as easy as gluing a camera to a wall, and actually, we've done just that.
Do you see any cameras here?
No.
We have 144 cameras in place here, and it took us just a day to do it, and they're virtually invisible.
They come in every color, so camouflaging is a cinch.
This is my favorite.

- (LAUGHS)

Sign her up.
- (LAUGHTER)

You know, I agree with the Hague, with the human rights activists all over the world.
There needs to be accountability.
Tyrants and terrorists can no longer hide.
We will see them.

If it happens, we'll know.
We're calling it... "SeeChange".
(APPLAUSE)
"SeeChange".
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Oh, we'll know the good things, too.
- (AUDIENCE) Aw.

We will see it all.
Because knowing is good.
But knowing everything is better.
(CHEERS, APPLAUSE)
Whoo!

MAE:

What's this party even for?
"SeeChange".

Come on, let's be the only ones who know how to dance!

How many people really get to know the President?
Oh, actually, do you wanna see something?
Oh, my God.

(BEEPS)
- Nice knocker.

(LAUGHS) Holy shit, right?
Right?

I think all of these have gotta be first editions?
Oh, but, um, you have to give me a verbal nondisclosure agreement, okay?
- Annie.

You shouldn't be here and probably won't ever be here again, so verbal NDA.
- I promise not to disclose anything.

This is where Bailey and Stenton make all of their plans.
It's very serious.

Oh, no, you probably shouldn't play with...
- Like this?

Well...
- So this is where it all happens.

We should get back to the party.
- (CELL PHONE BUZZES)

(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
- You're not coming back?

- Annie, it's like, 11 o'clock.

Ah.

- Annie...

- ("WOULD you WANT ME" PLAYING) - (INDISTINCT CHATTER)
- MAN:

Whoops.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
So I heard there's a party around here.
You know, if that's, like... your kind of thing.
Yeah, maybe I'll check it out.
It's probably not as interesting as whatever's on your phone, though.
Okay, probably not.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
- Do you want a drink?

I think they did too, but shh.
Are you serious?

- You have glasses in there, too?

- Oh.

Thank you.
You're new here.
- You are, right?

- I don't know, I just guessed.

I'm sorry. (LAUGHS)
What do you think?
- Of this?

I'm excited.
(SNIFFS) Mm-hm.
- (CHUCKLES) I'm sorry.

It's just everyone that works at the Circle is so excited to be here, and they just want to tell everyone about it all the time.

It's like, "Here, try this Kool-Aid!"
- Oh, Kool-Aid?

- Oh, wow!

- (LAUGHS)

(BOTH LAUGHING)
After my last job where I just tried to, like,
- calm down angry people all day...

I'm just grateful to be here.
I got to go put out a fire.
- Sounds exciting.

I'll leave you to it.
(LAUGHS)
Have a drink, have a good time, and stay excited.
You're at the Circle.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
Did he tell me his name?

(SIGHS)
- Have a good night, guppy.

("WITH FUN IN MY LIFE" PLAYING ON RADIO)
DAD:

- You have a glow.

- MOM:

- Like you're with child.

Ignore him.
So it's been great?
I don't think I ever wanna work anywhere else.
(EXHALES)
I told, um, Carolina's mom.
I might've let your salary slip.
- Oh, Mom.

It's been fun to casually insert it into conversation.
"My daughter works for the best company on the planet!
- And has full dental." - (CHUCKLES)
Please don't.

- If it wasn't for Annie...

She's good.
- Working too hard.

She's in the gang of 40.
Uh-huh.
She's in on all the big decisions, deals with regulatory issues in other countries.
That sounds important. (CHUCKLES)
Mae, hon, why don't you get your daddy another beer?
Sure, Dad.
Your hair.
It was a phase.
It was a cute phase.
You good?
I'm good.
You should come visit me at work sometime.
At the Circle?
I'll give that idea a smile.
- (SCOFFS)

They might think I was there to clean the toilets.
Come on.

All those tech guys secretly wish they knew how to use a hand saw, make something out of wood.
That really sums me up pretty well.
- It could be worse, I guess.

They want you to tell them about your secret hiking spots.
So they could put them on True You and ruin it forever?
Ooh, biting commentary.
I mean, come on, you have to admit, like, smiles and frowns used to be for middle school.
Like, "Hey, you know, do you like stickers and unicorns?"
"Yes, I love stickers and unicorns." Smile, you know.
And now... now it's everyone.
I can't help it if you're not... social.
I am social enough.

I assume you've heard about that Senator that's trying to, like, break you guys up
- citing antitrust laws, right?

Don't you have to go and chop some wood or something?
(SCOFFS)
- Thanks, hon.

His business is doing well.
Mercer?

They are beautiful, Mae.

Did I tell you I'm up to an 87 so far?

- (CHUCKLES)

MOM:

- Honey?

Oh.

Dad?

- What happened?

Honey, just, just...
Just tell everybody that Dad's not feeling well, and they'll understand, really.

- (GRUNTS)

Please, Mae.

- Come on.

MAE:

WOMAN:

Bye.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER CONTINUES)
WOMAN:

We cannot rely on them to say, "We're not violating antitrust laws."
I'm sure the Circle will be glad to cooperate.
We have every confidence that Senator Williamson's allegations will be discredited.
You are probably wondering about your new screen.
- (CHUCKLES)

- I'm Matt.

Dan said this would be a good moment to set up all your socials.
- Do you have time?

MATT:

I take it last week you were too busy to set up your company social account, and I don't think you've imported your old profile.
Sorry, I've just been kind of overwhelmed so far.
- Oh.

I just haven't had time yet for extracurricular stuff.
Wow.
That's so interesting you put it that way.
We actually see your profile and the activity on it as integral to your participation here.

Communication certainly isn't extracurricular, right?
Right.

We consider you a full knowable person of unlimited potential and a crucial member of the community.
But you're such an enigma.
I am?
It's been years since someone so shrouded in mystery started here.
- Everyone really likes you.

Strong ratings for your first week.
Are you satisfied with your performance?
Uh, I think I can do better.
Good, but it's not all about work, okay?
- It's all also about community.

It's all connected.
But you've had a blip or two when it comes to meshing with the community, like your absence at several weekend or evening events.
Which are, of course, optional.
- I'm sorry?

You left campus at 11:42 P.M. on Friday and got back 8:46 A.M., Monday.
Was there work on the weekend?
- Oh, no, no!

Oh, so sweet.
There wasn't mandatory work on the weekend.
This isn't like a clock in, clock out type place, thank God!
But, you know, there were thousands of people here participating in a hundred different activities.
So many.
I'm sorry, I, um...
My dad had an... an episode, and I was home helping out with that.
I'm so sorry to hear that.

Uh... yeah.
We didn't know anything about this incident.
Did you reach out to any Circlers during this crisis?
- Annie?

Mae, there are four groups here for staffers dealing with MS, two of them for children of MS patients.
Have you sought out a group?
- I didn't know.

Can you... talk about what you did the rest of the weekend?
Nothing, really.

You kayaked?

Nobody.

I kayak.
We could have kayaked together.
Nothing on your profile about kayaking, no smiles, no ratings, no posts.
I'm no psychologist, but this behavior sometimes stems from low self-worth.
This is what participation is all about, bringing you, lifting you up.
Thus, your participation window.
I can't believe you've been here this long without being on the main social feed.
You're about to have your world rocked.
See, these are all of last week's messages.
That's why there's so many.
- (STAMMERS) Eight thousand?

Looks like you have a lot of catching up to do here.

- (CHUCKLES)

Oh, forgot one more thing.
This is your participation rank.

Some people here call it the popularity rank, but it's not really that.
It's just an algorithm-generated number that takes into account all your activity in the inner circle.
That makes sense?
- I think so.

- It's just for fun!

(LAUGHS)
MAN:

WOMAN:

- MAN:

(TYPES)
MOM:

When are you coming home?

I can't.

How's the dorm?

- We have people that do that.

How's Dad?
He's okay.

And I couldn't lift him up, but thank God Mercer came by.
He's stronger than I thought.
I'm sorry.
I should have been there.
Is that one of his?
- Yeah.

(CAMERA CLICKS)
I gotta go, Mom.

- Okay, well, bye.

(TYPES)
I'm so sorry about last week.

(CHUCKLES) And I didn't mean to be a shitty friend.
It's okay.

Listen, I've been looking into your parents' situation, and I think...

All right?

- Hi.

- This is Jessica.

I understand you haven't done your medical intake yet.
- No.

All of it, if you can.
- I told you about Mae's dad's...

I did my post doc on MS. Love to get some real time data.
Here you go.
Okay.
- How does this feel?

- Is this for free?

Of course.

So, it's going to feel warm for a few days, then you and the media band will get used to each other, but it has to touch the skin to work.
Waterproof.

Let's activate it, shall we?
Is that the...?
Well, it's syncing up with the sensor you ingested a second ago.
- And now...

- Let's have you walk around the room.

Briskly.
It'll collect data on your heart rate, blood pressure, cholesterol, sleep duration, sleep quality, digestive efficiency, on and on.
And all that data is stored in the Cloud and in your tablet, anywhere you want, and of course, it's all collated with the rest of the Circle.
You'd be amazed at the patterns we see and the problems we can avoid when we have all that data.
Speaking of which, I was thinking it would make sense for... (CLEARS THROAT) Mae's folks to come on the Circle health plan.
Uh, wait, what?
JESSICA:

- (PATS CHAIR)

Can you get in touch with HR,
- clear it with them?

- Tell them I say it's a go.

We'll send someone out to set them up, okay?
MOM:

- Thank you.

- Aw.

This is amazing.

Okay.

- Exciting.

- I love you.

- Bye, Mom!

- (SOBS) Thank you.

All right.

- (BOTH LAUGHING)

(CROWD CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
TOM:

We live it.
We demonstrate our commitment to openness every day.
Our government, not so much.
We expect openness, and we get obfuscation.
We get doublespeak.
No wonder Congress' approval rating is currently at 11 percent.
(CROWD MURMURING)
Now, I'm sure a lot of you have heard about a certain Senator who it was revealed has been involved in some... very unsavory business.
What are we to learn from this?

We need openness.
We need to know what the people who represent us are doing with their time on our dime.
(CROWD APPLAUDING)
To serve us better.
Well, I'm happy to report that there's a woman who is taking all of this very seriously and is taking some pretty dramatic steps to address the problem.
So please join me in welcoming
Olivia Santos, Congresswoman for District 14.
(CROWD APPLAUDING)
SANTOS:

I am as concerned as you are about the need for citizens to know what their elected leaders are doing.
So I intend to show exactly how democracy can and should be.
Starting today, my every meeting, my every phone call and e-mail will be accessible to my constituents and to the world.
- In real time!

It will all be on my True You page.

TOM:

Hello, democracy.

SANTOS:

- WOMAN:

I started in CE, too.

Cool.

Biometrics, iris scanning, facial recognition.
Right now, I'm working on Child Track.
The program protects children from predators.
The second a kid isn't where they're supposed to be, an alert goes off and the kid can be tracked down within 90 seconds.
- Wow.

(LAUGHS)
Uh, you're...
You're serious?
I'm serious about immediately reducing kidnapping, rape, and murder by 99 percent.
I think I'm going to get a drink.
- But...

- It was nice to meet you.

("ASSIYO BELLEMA" PLAYING)
- Hey.

- 'cause I sent you an invite.

- Yeah, good to see you.

- Hi, Mae!

- You having fun?

(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
("18TH" PLAYING)
- Hey.

So, what did you think about the whole presentation?
- The Santos thing?

It's exciting.

- Momentous moment in the history of...

(SIGHS)
I thought it was a bit much.
- Just a little bit.

So where does all the data go?
Is it stored somewhere?

There's a physical place, too.
Do you wanna see something?
(SCANNER BEEPS)
(BEEPS)
So you're gonna have to leave your stuff outside before you go in.
Just because you're not supposed to... you know.
So I'm just going to have to take... this.

(DOOR LOCK CLICKING)
(MAE SIGHS)
I want to thank you already for this.
I love following strangers down dark corridors.
- This is the best.

(SCANNER BEEPS)
This holds Congresswoman Santos, every second of her from now on.
And this will be the next one.
- Just these?

What is this?
Well, it was supposed to be a part of a subway but they abandoned it.
- Where does it go?

But I've traveled about a half a mile into it, gets too wet.
(WATER DRIPPING)
And that's where the rest of it will be.
- The rest of what?

Santos is just the start.
The plan is everything recorded, seen, broadcast, all of it stored, analyzed, available to the Circle in any way.
You did your health intake, right?
- Yeah.

Every step, every breath, all of it stored.
They can use it however they see fit.
We're being studied.
Everyone's data in the Circle is being studied, monetized.
It is voluntary.
And isn't that the whole point?

I mean, that's True You.
That's not why I invented True You.

Ty Lafitte invented True You.
Yeah.
I'm Ty.
No, you're not.
Ty Lafitte has been off the grid for years.
- Oh, my God.

I'm Ty.
Why the low profile?
I just wanted to move through this world like a normal person.
I didn't wanna be watched every second.
But I do spend a lot of time here.
It's easier.

Not that I'm privy to their conversations in their little sanctum.
Holy shit.

Wait, hold on.

You never told me your name.
And after a while, it was just weird to ask.
(CHUCKLES)
I knew I could trust you when I met you.

Reminds me of how I used to be.
Listen, you can't tell anyone that you were here.
Okay?

Okay.
Things at the Circle, they need to change.
Like what?

Insuring my parents?
You should be really proud of what you created.
Look, proud?

The disregard for privacy, the use of personal data for the accumulation of wealth and control?
I'm not proud.

Do you think Senator Williamson being investigated by the FBI is just a coincidence?
We can't be seen together, and you have to promise me.
You can't tell anyone that we were down here.
(CELL PHONE BUZZES)
Hello?
WOMAN:

In the lobby?
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
- Hey.

- Are you okay?

Why didn't you call, send a text?
Because I wanted to see you in person.

Okay.
- Um, I'll sign you in.

- The stuff you posted about my work.

Yeah. (STAMMERS) I know you meant well, but...
What's the problem?

They started calling me a deer killer.
And then there's a campaign to shut me down.
I wasn't even online.

And when I checked my e-mail, there were death threats.
I'm sorry.
Death threats, Mae.
Obviously, I never meant for this to happen.
But I...

(MERCER SCOFFS)
Mae.
Mae.
Will you listen to me?
I can't do this.
I can't be a part of this world that you're creating.
What are you talking about?
Jesus Christ, look at these people!
Does this really seem okay to you?
Why don't you go kill some more deer, Mercer?
I never killed any deer.

Mercer, look, let's not do this here.
Let's go upstairs.
- I'll figure it out.

We used to go on adventures and have fun and see things, and you were brave and excited.
And now it's all filtered through this.
Bye.

(HELICOPTER PROPELLER WHIRRING)
I can't believe I was so stupid.
I'm so lucky that you guys were around here.
Luck?

"SeeChange" cameras saved your life.
A Cop saw you go through the fence, and then we got a call from someone watching the seals.
EAMON:

(GLASS CLINKS)
MAE:

I...

Well, I'm just glad you're safe.

And everyone who watched your adventure online.
I hope your folks weren't too worried.
They're doing okay.
I understand your father's condition has improved.
Very much.
Mr. Bailey...
I want to say how much I value my position here... and what you've done for my family.
Mae, you're a valued part of the Circle, and you're family.
And we care about everybody you care about.
You know, this incident has actually shown a lot of people the necessity for "SeeChange".
I'm so glad those cameras were there.
I wish you would've known there was a camera there before you swiped that kayak, but... (CHUCKLES)
Mae, Tom and I want to talk you about an idea, but before we do, is there anything you want to tell us?
That I've been here before?
It's only our lies that get us in trouble, the things we hide.
Of course I know you've been in here before.
(LAUGHTER)
And now that I know your secret, do you feel better or worse?
Better.
Relieved, actually.
I am a believer in the perfectibility of human beings.
When we are our best selves, the possibilities are endless.
There isn't a problem that we cannot solve.
We can cure any disease and we can end hunger, and...
Without secrets, without the hoarding of knowledge and information, we can finally realize our potential.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
EAMON:

I thought I'd change it up a bit today and not have a speech but an interview.
I had a conversation with a young Circler the other day that I wanted to share with you.
I've asked Mae Holland, who some of you might know as one of our new guppies in customer experience, to join me today.
Mae's only been with us for a few months but she has made quite an impression.
Let's bring her out.

(CROWD APPLAUDING)
EAMON:

- Terrified.

- Don't be nervous.

- Easy for you to say.

All right, Mae, we have all seen the "SeeChange" footage from the other night, but please describe what happened for us.
I committed a crime.
I borrowed a kayak without the owner's knowledge, paddled out to the middle of the bay,
and I wasn't wearing a life jacket.
Well, I'm not sure that's exactly a capital offense, but you did risk your own life.
So, Mae, do you think you behave better or worse
- when you are being watched?

Without a doubt.
And what happens when you're alone and unobserved?
Well, for starters, I steal kayaks.
(LAUGHTER)
Jesus.

Seriously.

I lie.
When we spoke the other day, you had a way of putting it that I thought was very interesting and succinct.
Could you tell us all what you said?
I said that secrets are lies.
Secrets are lies.
Go on.
Secrets are what make crimes possible.
We behave worse when we're not accountable.
I was my worst self because I didn't think anyone was watching.
I thought... that I was alone.
So, what did you see on this kayaking trip, Mae?
- Was it beautiful?

There was almost a full moon.
And it felt like... it felt like I was paddling through liquid silver.
Hmm, sounds incredible.
But there's no record of any of it.
- Not outside my own memory.

(CROWD MURMURING)
Okay.
So now here we get into something personal.
As you know, I have a son, Gunner, who was born with cerebral palsy.
And though he's living a very full life and we're always trying to improve his opportunities, he is confined to a wheelchair.
He can't walk.
He can't run.
He can't go kayaking.
So, what does he do if he wants to experience something like that?
Well, he watches video.
He looks at pictures.
And much of his experiences of the world come through the experience of others.
When he experiences the view of a Circler climbing Mount Kenya, he feels like he's climbed Mount Kenya.
When he sees firsthand video from an America's Cup crew member, he feels in some way that he's sailed in the America's Cup too.
And these experiences were facilitated by generous humans who shared what they saw with the world, my son included, and there are many others out there that are just like Gunner.
Now does it feel right to have deprived them of seeing what you saw, Mae?
It doesn't.
It feels very wrong.
It was selfish.
When you deprive others of experiences like the ones I had, you're essentially stealing from them.
Knowledge is a basic human right.
Access to all possible human experience is a basic human right.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
Thank you, Mae, for your candor and your consummate humanity.
Now... now the best part.
In the interest of sharing everything she can with the world,
Mae has, uh...

From now on...
I'll be wearing a modified "SeeChange" camera at all times.
I'm going fully transparent.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
Well, maybe not in the bathroom.
(LAUGHTER)
I'll be starting immediately.
EAMON:

Mae will be the first Circler to share every single second of her work and her personal life with the public, so let's give her an even bigger hand!
(APPLAUSE CONTINUES)
I'm proud of you.
(ALL CHANT) Mae!

Mae!

(ALARM CLOCK RINGING)
- (CAMERA CLICKS)

Good morning, everyone.
The sun is shining, and I definitely need my coffee.
We are in my third week of transparency, and we're up to... 2,308,007 viewers.
Wow.
Did I tell you guys I'm not a morning person?
Okay, among all of those viewers... are...
- MOM:

- Hi!

Say hello to everyone.
- BOTH:

Look.

- Yeah.

- These are great.

I love you guys.

- Love you.

- Hello, Circlers.

So this is where I worked when I first arrived at the Circle, and this is where I still work at the Circle. (CHUCKLES)
Because even though I have you guys looking over my shoulder... (SIGHS) I'm still basically a guppy.
- (LAUGHS) Go!

- (GROWLS)

MAN:

Stop looking at us, sheep!
All right, that's our scene.
- (CROWD APPLAUDING, CHEERING)

Sorry about that.

- Mae Holland!

Sorry, we don't know who that is.
- She's nobody, trust me.

Home sweet home.
Speaking of which, let's check in with the folks.
Hey, where are you guys?
- (MOANS)

- Yeah.

Um... (BREATHING HEAVILY)
Uh, I hope the engineers are watching, because that definitely shouldn't have happened (CHUCKLES)
And, um, it definitely won't happen again. (LAUGHS)
- You can trust me there.

(LAUGHS)
This is me brushing my teeth.
If you're enjoying this, I'm worried about you.
(WATCH BEEPS)
(EXHALES)
Good night, everyone.
I'm not gonna lie, it was a crazy day, but I'm happy I had you with me, each and every one of you.
MAE:

A lot of you guys have been asking me about this sculpture, which is a treat for me.
I finally get to use my art history degree.
This was made by an artist who has frequently been in trouble in his own country.
I wanna thank all the watchers who sent frowns to the government there, both for their persecution of the artist and for their restriction on Internet freedoms.
We have sent 180 million frowns from the U.S. alone.
You can bet that's gonna have an effect on the regime.
Annie.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
MAE:

Annie!
Annie!
Annie!
Annie Allerton!

Are we alone?
I have three minutes to use the bathroom without the video on.
(SCOFFS) Pervs.
How are you?

- Good.

You're killing it.
Do you think?
Oh, come on, false modesty won't work here.
You should be psyched.
Yeah.
- I am.

People are coming to me trying to get to you. (CHUCKLES)
It's... crazy.
How are you really, Annie?
You look wiped.
Thanks, Mae.

Let me take you for dinner.
(SIGHS) You gotta eat sometime.
Your camera and me looking so terrible.

I just... (STUTTERS) I'm worried about you.
- You're working too hard.

You're...

- I didn't mean it that way.

- I know you can handle it.

Your confidence in me will be the wind beneath my wings.
How are your parents?
Sorry.
(EXHALES)
They're over that little... episode?
I haven't heard from them, actually.

I guess it'll just take some time.
Sorry, Mae.

I'm fried.
And I have to pull another all-nighter.
Stenton is on my ass all the time.
I shouldn't have questioned him about that whole Senator Williamson thing.
And then...

But I assume Bailey told you about that.
Of course.
ANNIE:

I'll be there at the Concept Kingdom meeting tomorrow.
What?
- There's a Concept Kingdom...

- Yeah.

- Is that a problem?

I'm just surprised, that's all.

You know, maybe he's planning on having you attend just the beginning.
(CHUCKLES) I mean, Mae, you're in over your head.
MAE:

Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT)
I'm really so far behind on everything, I could just die.
Annie?
- (CAMERA CHIMES)

See ya.
EAMON:

Here's how many were eligible to vote.
And here is how many Americans are registered in the Circle.
- (LAUGHTER)

So now we get down to the meat of today's session, something we've discussed with Congresswoman Santos and others.
What if... your Circle profile automatically registered you to vote?
With True You, in order to set up a profile, you have to be a real person with a real address, the complete personal info, real social security number, with all the information that the government wants
when you register to vote.
So why wouldn't the state consider you already registered when you open a Circle account?
There's no reason.
Uh, we've got verbal commitments from governors of almost every state, and they've agreed to push for legislation that would make your Circle account an automatic path to voter registration.
MAN:

I think it's a great idea.
Well, yes, Mae.
Why couldn't we take it one step further?
I mean, I...
I don't have it completely figured out yet...
No, no, no, go on, go on, go on.

I like those words, "one step further." It's how the company was built.
Okay.

Go on.
We all agree 100 percent participation is what we'd like.
A hundred percent participation is the ideal.
That's the idealist's ideal, yes.
And we already have 83 percent of voting-age Americans registered to the Circle.
Yep.
And it seems we're on our way to users being able to register it and maybe actually vote through their Circle account.
Well, that's a small leap, but...

Why not require every voting-age citizen to have a Circle account?
- (ALL MURMURING)

Okay, I know the initial reaction will be resistance.
I mean, how can we require anyone to use our services?
But there are all kinds of things that are mandatory for citizens of this country.
Yep.

And we have to pay for Social Security.
- We have to serve on juries.

And we have to pee indoors, not on the street. (CHUCKLES)
- We do.

I mean, we have thousands of laws.
We require citizens to do hundreds of things, but we don't require them to vote?
They are already doing this in dozens of countries.
With the technology we already have, users will already be registered.
That means you have 241 million voters eligible to vote.
You have 241 million voters that have to vote.
You have the full will of the nation.
- And how exactly do we do that?

Well, you know, it could be something as simple as a zing,
"Hey, Annie.

It's what we would do with our own surveys.

- But, Mae, what about stragglers?

And what, 80 percent of us did that online last year.
Why not stop duplicating services?
Why not just make it all part of one unified system?
You could pay your taxes, vote, pay your parking ticket, all through your Circle account.
We'd save users hundreds of hours of inconvenience.
- We'd save the government billions.

We could eliminate half of it overnight.
Why wouldn't the government just build a similar service?
Why the hell does it need us?
It would cost too much.

- We already have the infrastructure.

The government needs us more than we need them.
Imagine having the full will of the people.
Instantly.
You'd have... true democracy for the first time in human history.
- ANNIE:

(DOOR CLOSES)
No voter suppression.

Think of the implications for totalitarian regimes.
No more rigged elections.
The UN can demand that they're held through the Circle.
- But only if everyone is heard.

Every human on Earth.
We can take the pulse of the nation, everyone in the world in seconds on any subject.
- It's the only way, right?

ALL:

So it looks like I've got 20 minutes here.
Let's try Mom and Dad.
- (LINE RINGING)

- Hi.

- Hey, where have you been?

I've seen your cameras aren't working.

Yeah, we disconnected them.
- Sweetheart...

We're sorry, but we, we can't keep doing this.
It's...

MOM:

- We love you.

And we're worried you don't realize what you've gotten yourself into.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
- DAD:

- Yeah, it's us.

(SIGHS)
- I love you.

Bye, honey.
(SNIFFLES)
- MAN:

(SIGHS)
(CROWD CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
(MAN HOOTING)
- Hello, everyone.

(LAUGHS) Okay.
We've had some good weeks thinking about Completion, envisioning a day when everyone is in the Circle, when all of humanity is connected and united.
And it will happen.
Already, 22 nations have agreed in principle to operate their elections through the Circle with mandatory participation from all of its citizens.
(CROWD CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
And when everyone is united, everyone is known, heard, accountable, they can be better served.
But what about the people who aren't part of the Circle, who don't want to be woven into the fabric of society or worse, want to tear out that fabric?
I want to introduce Soul Search.
And we're putting it to the test in front of the entire Circle audience, here and globally.
Do you feel ready?
- WOMAN:

TOM:

Great.
In seconds, the computer will select, at random, a fugitive from justice, a proven menace to our global community.
Our assertion is that whoever he or she is,
Soul Search will locate them in under 20 minutes.
- WOMAN:

Let's select that fugitive.
Okay.
This is Fiona Highbridge, 44 years old born in Manchester, England.
She was convicted of triple murder in 2004.
She locked her three children in the closet and went on holiday to Spain.
(CROWD MURMURING)
They all starved.
She was sent to prison in England but escaped with the help of a guard who she apparently seduced.
Over a billion people are watching.
Let's see how many are in the UK.
Do you all think 14 million Brits and a billion global participants worldwide can find Fiona Highbridge in under 20 minutes?
- (CROWD CHEERING)

MAN:

All right.
Let's bring up the clock.
Good.
- Is everyone ready?

On your mark... get set... go!
(CROWD CONTINUOUSLY CHEERING)
(LAUGHTER)
Okay, time to get serious.
WOMAN:

(CROWD APPLAUDING)
That's her.
Be careful.
I will.
- (CROWD CHEERING)

MAN:

WOMAN:

- Follow her.

Somebody stop her!

Stop her!
Somebody stop her!
- WOMAN:

Stop her!
Somebody grab her!
- TOM:

- It's Fiona Highbridge!

(CROWD CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
MAN:

FIONA:

(CROWD CHEERING)
Stop the clock.
WOMAN:

- I guess that's it.

WOMAN:

We could.
- Um...

Let's try for a regular civilian.
Okay, everyone.
We're gonna find a regular person.
It can be anyone.
A relative, a lost love.
When everyone can be found, we can never lose a friend.
We can take a suggestion from the audience.
- Uh... anyone?

(LAUGHTER, HOOTING)
I'm pretty sure he doesn't wanna be found. (CHUCKLES)
- Anyone else?

TOM:

Other suggestions?
- WOMAN:

It's the whole point of Soul Search, Mae.
No.
(CROWD) Mercer!

- Mercer!

No, I...
TOM:

EAMON:

- (CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

I think it's time we reunited Mae and Mercer, don't you?
(CROWD CHEERING)
All right then.

The perfect use of Soul Search.

(CROWD CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
Go, Mae, now.
Okay.
So our second Soul Search today involves not a fugitive from justice, but you might say a fugitive from, um... a friendship.
(LAUGHTER)
This is my friend Mercer.
I haven't seen him in a while.
I'd love to see him again.
Like Fiona, though, he is someone who is trying not to be found, but unlike Fiona, he's not a criminal.
He's good, people.
Let's see if we can break our previous record.
Whoo!
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
- (CROWD CHEERING)

Unbelievable.
Can you believe that?

MAN:

- Mercer!

Mercer, are you in there?
Are you, like, killing deer, making chandeliers?
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
WOMAN:

- MAN:

- WOMAN:

Mercer, come out.

Remember to be nice, okay?
Mercer, we know you're in there.
You found where he is.

I think we should leave.
TOM:

You've got millions of people enjoying this.
WOMAN:

There he is.

WOMAN:

(ENGINE STARTING)
MERCER:

(CROWD CHEERING)
(CROWD CONTINUOUSLY CHEERING)
(MOTORCYCLE REVIVING)
(WHISPERS) You're kidding me.
(CROWD CHEERING)
Can someone please get me audio on the camera?
Mercer.
Mercer, stop driving.

Mercer, stop the truck.
You're surrounded by friends.
(CAR HONKING)
Can we turn the speaker up?
Mercer.
Can you hear me?
Mercer, it's me.
(WHISPERS) You're surrounded by friends.
(CROWD MURMURING)
Mercer, stop.
(GRUNTS)
(SCREAMS)
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - (DOOR OPENS)
MOM:

You've been in bed for three days.
Come out in the garden with me today, okay?
I've got some new snapdragons that need to be planted.
Okay?
Honey.
Oh, honey.
- (SNIFFLES)

- Oh.

ANNOUNCER: (OVER RADIO) The California Department of Motor Vehicles has proposed regulation that self-driving cars should be required to have a licensed driver inside.
Is that a good principle?
MAN:

That's why we have fed... (SIGHS)
(LINE RINGING)
Mae.
Where are you?
- Are we alone?

Are we?
Yes.
How is it daytime where you are?
Wait, you're in Scotland.
Yep, I went home.

What happened?
What, besides almost ODing on speed and Soylent?
Well, I found out I'm allergic to wheat.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
Um...

I guess I almost died?
Oh, come on, no, don't.

Come on.

You getting better there?
Yeah, I am.
I eat.

Hadn't done that in years.
I'm glad you called.
I didn't want to lose you, too.
I know.
Listen, Mae, I'm really, really sorry about Mercer.
And I'm a shit friend.

I should've, and I'm sorry.
It's just so horrible.
Have they spoken to you about it?
Not yet.
I'm going in tomorrow.
Uh-huh.

They have to go.

They've made me suffer a thousand regulations.
There's got to be a way to...
What?

(SCOFFS) Yeah.
Do you need some time away here, too?

(CHUCKLES)
This feels so good, just being with you.
- Even like this.

Yeah.

This is going to sound crazy.

I keep having this feeling that...
Mercer would still be here if we hadn't lost touch.
No, come on, what were you supposed to do?
I mean, you know, he drifted away.
It happens.
Yes, but we have this technology, all this power.
Well, I mean, technology didn't exactly help the situation.
What if it could?
(COFFEE MAKER CLANKING)
MOM:

What were you doing in your room?

It helped.
I have friends all over the world.
They care.
Mm.
- I spoke to Annie.

Good.

I realized how much I missed her.
I have to go back.
Go back where?
Not to the Circle.
The Circle didn't kill Mercer, Mom.
It was a bad tool, a bad system.
It...

We're not gonna become Amish, Mom.
I...

- Mae, at least wait a bit.

I'm the only one who can do this.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
(LINE RINGING)
- TY:

Mae.

MAE:

- But I need your help.

EAMON:

TOM:

No contact for four days.

How are you doing?
I'm okay.
Tom and I have been talking about how little we knew about this young man Mercer.
He's someone we should have been able to help.
A fund should be established for his family.
Yeah, absolutely, that's done.
Listen, Mae, we would like to offer you a new role here at the Circle with no formal obligation, maybe a lighter schedule.
You can choose your own projects, and you can think long-term.
- You could take pottery, if you wanted.

I don't know if you're aware of this,
- but one of our founders, Ty Lafitte...

Was given the same opportunity, and now he loves his freedom.
And I don't know if this is any consolation, but at our next Dream Friday... (STAMMERS) We're going to imagine a world in which every disturbed young man could be kept safe.
Would you like to join us?
I'm not sure I'm ready for that.

Take your time.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
I did what you asked.

It's worse than I could've imagined.

I never met him, but they should build a monument to Mercer.
- Yeah.

Okay, he's the martyr who will wake everyone up, right?
I don't know what you're planning, but if you turn that camera back on, whatever you say about the Circle is heard around the world, and it changes everything.
OPERATOR:

Hello again.
- Hi!

And that is how it should have been, how it could've been, but we didn't have the technology.
But we will.
And when we do, when every vehicle is known and connected, the data we have will help us improve traffic patterns, keep drivers safe, and optimize Circle services across all platforms.
Shopping.

Attractions.
Attractions like Mae Holland.
- Mae, come on out here.

Come on out here.

Oh, you're transparent again.

Hello, hello.
Mae Holland.
- (CROWD CHEERING)

Now, Mae is a brave person because even amid her grieving, she knows that she has a responsibility to her followers, to the whole world, really.
Thanks for saying that, Eamon.

I know that Tom, he agrees, too.
- Right, Tom?

- Come on.

First, I want to thank everyone here and around the world for the support you've given me since we lost Mercer.
These past days, I've realized something about myself and about the Circle.
It's that I don't want to be disconnected.
I don't want to have to search for friends, family, my loved ones.
We lost track of Mercer.
But what if we never lost touch with each other?
What if instead of searching... we always knew?
What I am proposing is radical openness and unbroken connection.
It would have to start here.
- (CROWD APPLAUDING)

You know the usual hypocrisy of the digital world.
We want everything in the Cloud, and yet our leaders... live above it.
So I want to invite Eamon and Tom to join me in this experiment that they've pioneered.
I invite them to set an example for the Circle and the world... to go transparent.
(CROWD CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
What do you say, guys?
Will you join me?
Wouldn't it be great to know their every move, their every word?
From now on, every message, meeting, phone call, all will be public, knowable, never erased.
In fact, Ty Lafitte has helped us make every document in the company's history public.
Every message, every plan including...
And this is my favorite part, every e-mail, from Tom and Eamon's accounts, and their private accounts... (CROWD MURMURING)
And their secondary confidential accounts. (CHUCKLES)
And even their super-secret scrambled code accounts, that nobody, not even their assistants or wives knew existed.
Until now.
It's all been sent to you already.
(MURMURING)
We are so fucked.
I think we're entitled to that kind of access.

- ALL:

Mae, you are a very brave woman to do this.
There are no more secrets.
Privacy was a temporary thing.
And now it's over.
We won't live in the shadows anymore.
Hey.

(CELL PHONES BEEPING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm tired of hiding, these passwords and secret knocks, the difference between public and private.
Aren't you all?
Come to think of it,
I'm tired of standing here in the dark.
Don't worry.
Eamon will catch up.

Either way, it's time for a change.
We're gonna remake this place.
And if we do it right, we will set an example for everyone.
The future won't wait.
