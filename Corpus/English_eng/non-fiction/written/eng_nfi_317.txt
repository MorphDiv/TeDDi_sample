- Previously on Stitchers...

- It was me.

I'm not a hundred percent sure.
I know what quantum computers are and how entanglement triggers work.
He had surgery a couple days ago, and since we're locked down, I have no idea how he's doing.
Call.

He died.

- You know where she is.

One day, you'll be reunited with her.
Kristin, what is it?

Cameron, you okay there?
Blair wants to kill your mother.
Find out where she is and find a way to tell me.
- Why are we here?

My colleagues are being reassigned, I don't want that to happen.
Anything else?
I want Maggie Baptiste to run the Stitchers program.
Is that it?
No.

How long would you have waited for me when I was trapped in my memory?
Forever.
When you were trying to get me to bounce, wh... what did you mean when you said...
You can't help me if you're stuck in here.
- I never said that.

_
Ugh, thank god you're here.

I didn't know I was supposed to.
You know, considering it was my idea to go all Mommy Dearest on Kirsten in the stitch, I thought I might be at least worth a latte.
Also, you don't come to a person's house empty-handed.
Were you raised in a barn?
- So, is Kirsten up or...

Oh.

I'm a lotta things, Cameron.
Blondie's keeper is not one of them.
- Mm.

- Hm.

- Oh.

- do it?

I'm just saying.

Kirsten's a virgin.
Ahh, I don't think she's a virgin.
Emotionally.

She's a virgin.
This is gonna be her first real relationship where she's connected and available, you know?
I got it.
I don't know if you do.
I'm tryin' to say...

'Cause this thing that you two have affects all of us.
Yeah, I said I got it.
Yeah?

Your hands were shakin' pretty good.
I was just tired.

I guess so.

I'm gonna get dressed while you make me breakfast.
- How do you like 'em?

Sabine.
Sabine?
Where did you go?
Sabine!
Sabine!
Hey.

I have not, but I just got in myself.
Oh.

- She's good.

- A rock.

A little less rock-like, but, um, my father was my hero, and I'm gonna soldier on and make him proud.
- I know you will.

Yeah.
Hey, uh, I gotta go and talk to Maggie.
- What about?

Stuff?

- Minute?

- Question.

- Ivy.

Look, I know that you're feeling a connection with her and that she helped you find out about your father.
- She helped all of us.

I get it.

Oddly but accurately stated.
Who knows what her connection is to him?
I could just ask her.
- Done?

- Bye.

Oh!

- Ooh.

Best boyfriend, ever.
I know.

The "You can't help me" comment you think I said.
- Never said it.

That's possibility number three.
Number one is that Stinger said it to you from the hijacked signal.
- What's number two?

- You mean damaged me?

I just wanna run some tests.

I'm fine.

We're gonna do it.

So don't be a baby, baby.
Hey, do you wanna get some dinner tonight?
I think we should talk.
Okay, about what?
Us.
We're up.
About us?

Victim's name is Sabine Colt.
She's the daughter of an investment banker, born and raised in New York City, but she's been living here in LA with her boyfriend, Nic.
- Cause of death?

There were signs of a struggle.
The M.E. will have a full workup soon.
Police are questioning the boyfriend now.
- What do we know about him?

Okay, in the meantime, let's start with Sabine.
- All right, Kirsten, you ready?

'Cause if you're not, you know, we can...
Is this thing on?

Yeah, it's on, smart-ass.
Lights to 20%, please.
Are you ready?
I'm fine.
I need a go, no-go for stitch neuro-sync.

- Go.

- Go.

- Go.

- Go.

- Go.

Is this on?
- I guess I deserved that.

It's Nic and Sabine.
They're having drinks.
It's very romantic.
Really sweet.
Okay, new memory.
- Things are heating up.

Um.

I'm getting a spotty neuro-sync on Kirsten.
Yeah, yeah, I'm seein' that, too.
Are you all right, Kirsten?
Fine, just... watching.
Her respiration is up.
Heart rate, too.
Her oxytocin levels are rising in response to what she's seeing in the stitch.
I'll have what she's having.
If you want, we can leave you there for a little while, come back later.
- Huh?

All right, you're on the move, Sally.
I'm... on a street somewhere.
It's...

Sabine!
Weather foggy or brain foggy?
I told you, please don't worry about me.
- Yeah.

Just stick to the plan.
Some guy just gave her a phone.
Wait, I'm be...

They're canoodling again.
- Whatever happened...

Uh, Sabine's asking about Nic's father.
He got it.
Heart rate and respiration are climbing again.
There's something about a contract.
Contract.

Uh, I'm seeing unlock codes for the phone.
- Have her call them out.

1-2-3-5.
2-4-6-1.
8-7-6-4.
I'm in a field.
Sabine has a messenger bag.
What's in the bag?
It's too foggy, I can't make it out.
Here we go again...
They're... they're having pool sex.
As in sex in the pool?
Completely overrated.
That's a true fact.
Comin' up on the death memory.
Where are you going?
Hey!
Nick!

Aren't we swimming?
- What's happening?

Kirsten, get outta there!
Ayo, how's Kirsten?
Chill, Cameron, I'm fine.
Do you need anything, like a water or oxygen?
- Cold shower?

Sabine was spying on Nic.

So Nic found out and killed her.
No, he... he didn't do it.
- Maybe he set her up.

If Nic didn't do it, then who?
Nic's father.
Viktor Comenko, Nic's father, is a powerful businessman with loads of moolah.
His company, Novogorsk Steel, just landed a huge contract with the Russian military.
That must be the contract Nic told Sabine about.
She passed on inside information she got from Nic, pissed off Daddy,
- and he killed Sabine?

Because the big man never leaves, say it with me now...
Mother Russia.
Why?

Survived three different attempts on his life in the past seven years.
Never travels without private security.
- So he paid someone else to do it.

But he's notorious for running the entire operation himself.
Doesn't think anybody can do as good a job at anything as he can.
That might not extend to murder.
Apparently, the only person Viktor trusts is his son, Nic.
By all accounts, Nic is as loyal to Daddy as Daddy is to him.
Right.

Okay, bring him in, get him talking.
While Nic's here, Cameron and I will go search his house, see if we can find the encrypted phone and the messenger bag.
Word's out that you're a computer whiz.
NSA sent me over to audit your class.
That's cute.
- What you really doin' here?

Letting me call my mother.
I'm sorry, um... that you didn't get the news you wanted about your father.
At least I found out, so thank you.
Look, I gotta ask you straight up.
Are you still working with Stinger?
No.

He made me think there was this big plan to get the family all back together, but...

Linus, um, I've got class.
If you wanna practice GarageBand or learn basic programming, stay.
If you wanna keep grilling me about my dad, it's not gonna happen.
Look, first, GarageBand is really cool.
And second, no more grilling.

Might be better if you didn't.
It's just... it's gonna get in the way... of you and your friends.

Yeah, but Kirsten is literally yours.
Yeah.

Linus, I've got class.
Yeah, I...

Thanks.
Hey... what are you doin' later?

Are you asking me out?
Yeah.

I have parent-teacher conferences tonight.
Yeah.
You can pick me up at 8:00.
Okay.

This is a waste of time.
Okay?

Okay.

But did you trust her?
Yeah.

Then who was she talking to on her super-secret phone?
What secret phone?
Oh, you know, it's the type of phone you would use to cheat on your husband, or make a call from a prison cell, or in Sabine's case, talk about your boyfriend with nefarious types
you don't want him knowing about.
She was chatting up somebody about your father pretty good.
I'm not answering any more questions.
If you know anything about Sabine's murder, if you think your father was behind it, you can tell us.

I would never be afraid of my father.
Now, you guys want more answers?
Come visit me in St. Petersburg.
You're a suspect in a murder investigation.
You're not goin' anywhere.
Well, then you obviously don't know my father.
Well, I checked with Washington, and the Russian embassy has intervened, and Viktor Comenko has arranged to have his son sent back home.
W... so that's it?
Well, I'm gonna do my best to stop it.
In the meantime, we have a new medical examiner in the program.
Check in, see if she found any other DNA on Sabine's body that wasn't hers or Nic's.
- Maybe the killer left some behind.

Find anything?
No bag.

Hm.

If Sabine hid something here, she made sure Nic couldn't find it.
- Okay.

Okay, hold on.
You don't want to?
No, I...

It's just...

It's not.
I'm just excited.
Yeah.

That's great, I mean...

I'm your first real emotionally-connected relationship.
I... no, I'm just sayin' I...

Hm.

Y... you wanna have the, uh, "this is how we feel about each other" talk?
Yeah.
Hm.

Oh, well, I have, and it's horrible.
But then again, so's modern art.
But even something like this is worth a bucket of money to someone.
I...
It's just squares.
Kirsten?
What are you...
Do you remember any of the unlock codes?
Yeah. 1-2-3-5.
Okay.
Try the next one.
And...
Are you sure you're remembering these correctly?
I mean, you were a little distracted during that last stitch.
- Mm-hm.

Four incorrect attempts and this phone bricks.
Linus.
Hello?
- Nasty, right?

Ejected from his car during a high-speed chase, landed on a freeway sign 20 feet off the ground.
- Ugh.

Uh, I'm looking for the M.E.?
Oh, well, you found her.
Amanda Weston.

I hear you're snarky.
Well, what does that make you?
- Grumpy?

Did you want somethin'?
I wanted to get off on the right foot with you.
Well, I already got the rundown of working with you guys, if that's why you're here.
Send you crime victims, obscure the paperwork, stall the full autopsies until said victims are returned in three to five days...
I am actually here about a case, Sabine Colt?
We're curious if any DNA was found on her body other than Nic Comenko's.
Right.

The snark is strong with you, too.
We make it look good.
Uh, DNA results are not back in yet.
You think you could speed 'em up?
I could.

See, if I put a rush on it, people are gonna ask why, and then I'd have to tell them about our super-secret NSA program, and then you'd have to kill them.
I guess I'll wait for your call.
Oh?

Sure I can't just text it to you?
Where's the fun in that?
So, how did it go with M.E.?
Uh, she doesn't really come off like an M.E., she's more like a...

"Rebel Without a Corpse."
- DNA?

Yes.

I did some digging, and I found this.
Apparently, Sabine's family made a series of bad investments over the past few years.

But with a lifestyle to keep up.
That must be the situation that Sabine was trying to help with.
She was raising cash for her family.
By selling inside information about Nic's father's company.
But then it became about more than just secrets, something she didn't wanna be involved in.
So, either she got killed for what she did do or what she wouldn't do.
She did sound pretty afraid of whoever was on the encrypted phone.
Yeah.

Sabine used in the stitch.

Next failed attempt, and all of the data, including her call history, gets wiped, so we thought maybe Linus could work his magic on it.
Yeah, I'll work my magic first thing in the morn...
No.

But I've got someplace that I wanted...
Tonight.

There wasn't anything at Nic's house.
I saw Sabine find it in a field.

Carousels.

- Two of them are in shopping malls,

- One at the Santa Monica pier,

- It wasn't that one, either.

What?

Please, let it be Disneyland.
No, it wasn't either of those.

- Mechanical?

Did it sound like this?
- Ow.

AKA the peacock.

- That's Griffith Park.

- Yeah, first thing in the morning...

- But we were going to...

- The zoo.

Uh, it's Am... it's Amanda...

- Take it.

Don't screw that up.
Griffith Park.
- Hello.

I got your DNA results.
- Tell me.

We're on a secure line.
Not over the phone.
Meet me.

I'll text you the address.

Don't be late.
Hey.

I'm almost finished, but, dinner?
About that.

- Mm.

I love me a good code.

Oh.

Uh, it's just pattern recognition is kinda my super power.
But, uh...

Daniel Stinger's daughter.
Maybe this is a bad idea.
The unlock code is four digits.
We've got four attempts, we've already burned through three of 'em.
One more and the data fries.
That's 10 digits.
Uh, that's the number for Korean barbecue.

They deliver.

I'm not the, uh, only one who's been acting differently lately.

What are you talkin' about?
I'm not bein' jumpy.

There's just something's goin' on with you that I don't understand.
So I hear.
Like, why did you think you heard something
I didn't say in that stitch, and... what... why was that stitch today foggy?
I don't know.

Then again, maybe you are, you know.
I'm just trying to be a good scientist.
Good scientist... or worried boyfriend?
Why can't I be both?
Let's just talk about this over at...

She threw it in there.
The messenger bag is behind the rocks.
What?

No.

- Yep.

One word:

♪ You do it to me ♪
♪ Something I do ♪
♪ You do it to me ♪
♪ Something I do ♪
♪ Whoa, you do it to me ♪
♪ Lover, you do it ♪
♪ You're just someone's clown ♪
♪ Entertainment, hand it over ♪
Hey, you made it!
I didn't know you spin...

Whatever the hell you call it.
How would you?
- Uhh...

Uh, oh god.

Oh.

You fully could've told me that on the phone.
I know, but then you wouldn't be here drinking whiskey with me.
♪ Whoa, you do it to me ♪
It's, polynumeric?
Well, there's no letter substitution that tracks.
Steganographic?
Not unless it's hiding in plain sight.
It is a rolling cipher!
Okay.

Multiply that by the first number in the first sequence, it's two, and the...
Take two, multiply it by the second number in the first sequence, that's four!
It works!
- Okay.

Two, four, six, three!
Are... are...

Positive.
But, if you don't trust me, I...
N... no, no.

- Ha!

You really have a super power!
Okay, this is the last number she dialed.
Right.
I appreciate the NSA's dry cleaning policy.
You know, there'd better be a good reason I'm here right now.
Oh, have you been drinking?
I went to a club.
Any DNA?
Mm.

Negative.

What were you doing at a club?
No one.

- What am I looking at?

This better be good.

Ugh, TMI, Fisher.
Hey, sometimes oysters is oysters.
What's inside of the bag?
That's a lotta coke.
It wasn't a squared Fibonacci or a descending harmonic reverse.
Just simple rolling cipher.
Way to go, man of science.
Actually, it was a woman of science.
Ivy figured it out.
Ivy?
This is a highly-classified NSA investigation...
That Ivy helped us with.

I didn't tell her any details of the case.

Sabine used this phone to call this single number.
Oh, this is why I'm here.
So seriously, no one else knows how to use a tablet?

Looks like it's a New York number registered to a Jack Dalliford, who... just turned up dead behind a Manhattan pizzeria on Bleecker Street.
I will get his body sent right over.
Well... cheers.
Uhh, thank god you're here.

I thought you needed a ride to work.
Those are not mutually exclusive concepts.
I'll go see what's in the fridge.
- Thank you.

Thank you so much.
- This better be work-related.

Meet me at the Lowdown for the lowdown.

I'm not falling for that again.
Come on.

Ahhh...
Hey.

Creep my Instagram tonight.

I...

Did I hear the sounds of telephonic flirtation?
What?

- You met someone.

Maybe.

I hope you have.

Thank you.

Call him back.

I don't know.

Everyone deserves to be trusted until proven otherwise.
That sounds like a horrible policy.
It is... unless it isn't.
- Doctor?

Hey, we plugged the hole on being hacked, yes?
- Yes, totally.

Completely totally.

Kirsten heard me say something to her in the stitch which I never said.
Glitch or faulty memory?
- Outside force?

- Thanks.

- Where you at, K-Max?

In New York, I think.
How's the weather?

Nope.

What did you find out?
His father got the contract.
I'll be in touch.

I'll be in touch.
Buy Novogorsk Steel, as many shares as you can.
Sabine called Dalliford, told him about the steel contract, then he called someone else and told them to buy shares of Novogorsk Steel.
Dalliford was running an insider-trading scam.
It would seem so.
Wait, I'm being pulled into another memory.
I'm in a room.

- Please stop.

Please stop.
Well?

You knew to buy shares.

Someone's wailing on him pretty hard.
Ooh!
They wanna know how he knew about the steel contract.
- Can you see the guy?

Bulldog-looking thug.

Comenko's son.
He... has a girlfriend.
- She's been feeding me information.

I'm gonna need her to do something for me.
You told me you can control her.
Bulldog wants Dalliford to get Sabine to do something for him.
She won't do it.

She'll have to be helpful in some other way...
Helpful in some other way.
Death memory in four seconds.
Get the hell outta there, Kirsten.

No!

Sabine was killed because she wouldn't plant the drugs on Nic.
- To shut her up?

What would planting drugs on Nic accomplish?
It would've gotten him detained, questioned.
Yeah, but killing Sabine and making him a person of interest in the murder did that, too.
But is that all Bulldog wanted, just to get Nic detained?
What does getting Nic detained buy someone?
Opportunity.
Think about it.

He'd come himself to rescue his son.
Which is I'm guessing is exactly what he's doing.
Now, Comenko can't travel with his armed detail, so he's more vulnerable in the states than he was in Russia.
Killing Sabine was the bait in a plot to kill Viktor Comenko.
And that, my friends, is how the Russian nesting dolls unnest.
Okay, we need to find Nic and his father before they both end up dead.
None of Comenko's jets have left Russia in the past 72 hours.
Yeah.

So I said to myself, "If I'm Comenko",
"I'd probably have a whack of false papers to use if I need to blow town should Moscow get a hate-on for me, right?"
So I ran Comenko's photos through the Interpol passport registry and got a hit on three different aliases.

Nicolai and Mikael Karlaff.
- Karlaff?

The Comenkos are traveling under that particular alias.
They're probably on their way to LAX now.
Okay, I'll call TSA, have them hold the Comenkos until Fisher can put them in protective custody.
Camille... good work.
Hey.

I found a couple plane tickets for Nic and Viktor under assumed names.
Viktor Comenko wouldn't fly commercial.
He'd be completely exposed.
Okay... think.

I'd hire the best I could locally.
So, we need to get into Russian banking records and see if he's hired any LA-based security.
How hard could that be?
With enough time it's not hard, but we don't have enough time.
I'll be back.
Fisher called.

You gotta be frickin' kiddin' me.
- I told you this was a bad idea.

Ivy worked in banking for years.
She knows how to navigate the international banking system.
It's not like she hasn't seen the inside of the lab before.
Cameron, what do you think?
If I'm being totally honest, I don't think it's a good idea.
Camille, what about you?
Um... everyone deserves to be trusted until proven otherwise?
Find Comenko, let's get it done.
Got it.
It looks like Comenko's hired Seraph Private Security on a few occasions over the years when he's come to Los Angeles.
Well, these guys are no joke.

They've got a full security detail dispatched into a private hangar at the Santa Monica airport in 20 minutes, leaving from Seraph's headquarters.
Where's Seraph's headquarters?
Broadway.

Bet you a bitcoin the Comenkos are there now waiting to be taken to their plane.
I agree.

Thank you, Ivy.

Hold it!

Nic and Viktor Comenko, we need you to come with us.

Technically, I'm not even here.

- and leaving America now.

Sweetie, tell me something I don't know.
That's Bulldog!
Watch out, Nic!
Kirsten, get down!
Target down!
- Clear!

How'd you guys know to come here?
Sabine showed me the way.
Viktor Comenko was targeted by a competitor in the Russian steel business who lost out on the military contract.
He thought killing Comenko would reopen negotiations.
How's Comenko doing?
Stable, and actually grateful for our help.
Nothin' like a bullet to soften a guy up.
So, Ivy came through for us again, huh?
I understand that we are split about her, but until we know where her loyalties are, we have to protect ourselves, understood?
New business.

I will be taking on Blair's duties, which means that I will be in Washington occasionally.
Making the NSA great again?

Which means I need to appoint someone to take on my responsibilities in the lab when I'm not here.
Now, I have put a lot of thought into this, and the only person that the only person that I think is capable of doing the job... is Cameron.
Maggie, nah, come on, I'm more of a...

You'll be great.

So excited.
Uh, you got a minute?
Sure.
Why Cameron?
You mean why not you?
Whoever runs this place, their first job... is to protect the team.
"Everyone deserves to be trusted until proven otherwise"?
That is a bad policy in our business, and can get people killed.
- I made a mistake.

Okay.
Look at you, big boss man.
Yeah, I have a feeling this isn't gonna be one of those fun promotions.
Oh, well, as long as you don't abuse your authority and start ordering tests on me.
Kirsten... everything I do is because I care about you.

I need to know why you think you heard what you heard in that stitch.
I need to know that stitching is safe for you.
I need you to trust me.
I do trust you.
I wanna believe that.

But you're not sure.
Let's just talk about it at dinner.
Oh, right, when we have "the talk."
Yeah.
I...

♪ I put my bag into the back seat ♪
♪ I drove my heart cross the country ♪
♪ And now I'm awake and feel me comin' back to life ♪
