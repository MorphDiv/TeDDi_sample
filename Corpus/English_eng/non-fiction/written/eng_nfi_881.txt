Kristy:

Uh-oh.
Yeah, I was drying David off when he looks at me and asks,
"Mommy, do you have a scrotum?"
[Laughing] Oh, no.
- Yeah.

I told him, "No."
But now, no surprise, scrotum is his favorite word.
He's taught his brother, too.
I'm sorry I wasn't there to handle that one.
No, it's fine.
I'm just happy he knows the actual anatomical word.
Maybe it means he'll be a doctor.
Or maybe it just means he's a boy.
Yeah, probably.
So how's the search for your grandmother going?
Not great.
Most of Mom's leads are dead ends.
I should have got more information before she passed.
So what I thought would take a couple days is looking like it's gonna take a week.
And I shouldn't be doing this on my vacation.
That's for you and the kids.
Matt.

Your mom wanted you to find her.
And maybe next year, we'll all go together once you do.
- If I do.

Besides you have to now because I've already told all the kids that they have a great-grandmother who is ready to spoil them rotten.
Oh.

Okay, but I wanted to.
Look, I know this is hard, but...
Babe, I got to call you back.

Sorry to crash your vacation.
How's that going, by the way?
Simmons:

Turns out there are a lot of little old Korean ladies in Korea.
I'll bet.

Thank you.
Where are you staying?
Well, I rented this great little place.
It's a traditional Korean home called a hanok.
And I was thinking that we could stage out of it since it's in the city versus out by the airport, and it's completely wired.
Sounds good.
Okay, so I've been in touch with the Korean National Police Agency, they're grateful for our help.
And our liaison with the Seoul PD is Senior Inspector Joon-ho Kim.
He's a 20-year veteran.

- That should be helpful.

While the higher-ups are happy that we are aboard,
Joon-ho seemed a bit... chilly.
Told me he was used to working alone.
It'll be fine.
What do you have, Monty?
Monty:

She was in Seoul for the last six months teaching English in a placement service called The Land of the Morning Calm.
Is this her first time out of the US?
No, her parents said that she had spent her junior year in Spain and had traveled extensively during that time.
Jack:

Yes, police found a hand stamp and tracked her to Club Seoleun nearby.
The video footage puts her there up until about 10:00 PM.
Seoul PD should have e-mailed you the police report and crime scene photos by now.
Fair warning, the photos are tough to look at.
Whoa.
What happened to her face?
Looks slashed and beaten, and her jaw looks crushed.
Yeah, ME's not sure.
The unsub stuffed her in a plastic trash bag and then put her into a jumbo shopping cart before leaving her by a dumpster to be picked up in the Itaewon District, which is popular amongst ex-pats and soldiers from the nearby US military base.
So our immediate vicinity gives us a varied suspect pool.
We could be looking at a local or a foreigner who did this.

Jack:

And an urge like that is only stopped one of two ways...

Simmons:

"The gem cannot be polished without friction.
Nor man perfected without trials."
Matt, good to see you in the flesh.
Hey, Jack.

I sent Mae over to the morgue and Clara over to Seoul PD to see if she can find any other case that fit a similar MO.
Oh, Inspector Kim, this is my boss and unit chief of the IRT, Jack Garrett.
Pleased to meet you.
The club has extensive security cameras, so we were able to get a good look at Jessica's movements throughout the night.
She came to the club with those women?
Uh, no, I actually went to her apartment, spoke to a couple of her friends, and they said that she likes to go out often alone.
And who's that?
An employee of the club.
A Booker.
The men sit at tables and order bottle service, and if they see a woman they like, the Booker retrieves her.
It's a type of forced socialization.
I wouldn't call it forced...
The women know what they're getting into.
Now, what's the expectation once a woman's been booked?
Just conversation.
Well, let's see where she ended up.
Well, I'm thinking he wants more than just conversation.
Wait a second.
Who's this?
We don't know.
But she does.
Look at how her body language changed after he sat down.
Crossed her arms, she's tensing up.
She's scared, but only of him.
A club doorman confirmed that that man left the vicinity, and that's all we know for now.
Jessica stayed at the table for another 10 minutes with the men who booked her, and then she left alone.
What happened to the other men who were sitting at the booth with her?
I'm assuming they were irritated when Jessica left early.
No, they found other girls.

The baeg-in did this.
White guy.
Question is, who is he?
I wouldn't be surprised if it was someone she knew.
Why's that?
Well, because I have evidence of extreme overkill here.
And all of it is concentrated on her face.
Well, that could mean we're looking for a male unsub, someone who has issues with women and their perceived attractiveness.
Maybe betrayed by an ex or something?
Well, the Korean ME and I have arrived at the same COD...

So she bled out after the unsub slashed her throat, but not before he mutilated her face.
- The mutilation was perimortem?

I mean, she was tortured.

Do we have any more specifics about what the unsub did to her face?

Unfortunately, no, that plastic bag accelerated the decomp and the bloating and obliterated a lot of the details.
I have evidence that her eyes and her nose were slashed and that her mandible was crushed.
And to be honest,
I've never seen such extensive damage done to a victim's face before.
All right, Mae, thanks.
- We'll see you soon.

Go ahead, Monty.
I did a little digging into Jessica's social media and found out that she and a guy named Grayson Faber, 25, of Tallahassee, Florida, had been in a brief relationship.
Looks like the guy from the club.
Yeah, Grayson and Jessica were both English teachers at the same school, but two weeks ago, she blocked him from all of her social media, which currently is a surefire sign that there's an issue between a man and a woman.
You know what went down?
You know I do.
I called The Land of Morning Calm and spoke with a Ms. Thompson.
She said that Jessica had filed a formal complaint against Grayson, said that they dated, and after she broke it off,
Grayson was harassing her.
She asked that he be transferred to another school.
- That happen?

I then did a background check and found that he was questioned but never arrested for pistol-whipping one of girlfriends in Florida.
So he has a motive and a temper.
You know where we can find him?
Should be at the school...

[Chatter]
Now, remember, we don't say good-bye, right?
We say peace out.
- Peace out.

See you tomorrow.
- Grayson Faber?

I'm Agent Jack Garrett, this is Agent Simmons.
We're with the FBI.
Like to ask you a few questions about Jessica Townsend.
Uh, yeah, sure.

♪ ♪
Simmons:

Get up.
I didn't have anything to do with what happened to Jessica, okay?
So why'd you run?
I just panicked, you know, FBI.
That's, like, for real.
I mean, I've seen the news.
I know what happened to her.
When was the last time you saw her?
Couple nights ago.

Yeah, we saw the tape.

Yeah, well, she was trying to tank me at work.
Because you're harassing her.
A couple phone calls is harassment?
Couple hundred's more like it.
Plus, you showed up late at night at her house.
Kind of like what you did to the girl in Tallahassee...
Right before you cracked her skull open with your glock.
- That never happened.

So, what happened after you left Jessica at the club?
Nothing.
I went home.

Anyone able to confirm that?
No.
Clara:

Hey, what did you get?
Well, Jack was right.
We are looking for a serial killer.
Two weeks ago, a British woman...
Barbara Walker, 24, blond...
Her body turned up at a trash dump outside of Seoul.
Well, it says here that, although Barbara's body was severely decomposed, the ME found facial trauma consistent to what I found on Jessica.
Why didn't the Korean cops make the connection?
Well, Barbara's body was discovered at the city dump, which covers a lot of the city's area.
So, different jurisdictions means different departments.
Maybe they never communicated.
Okay, well, Barbara's autopsy report was dated two weeks ago, and Jack just discovered that Grayson guy was in Thailand until three days ago.
So, her couldn't have done this to Barbara, or to Jessica.
Yeah, which means the killer is still out there.
♪ ♪ [sirens]
We ID'd the victim as Elsa Byquist, from Stockholm, Sweden.
23 years old, she worked as a shop girl nearby.
Unsub has a type.

That's the man who called it in.
He works at the convenience store around the corner.
Now, he says, when he arrived for his shift at 11:00 PM, he didn't see the cart, but when he came back out at 2:00 AM for a cigarette, it was there.
You say that we're looking for a serial killer, yet you let the American go?
He could have done this, as well.
We belive the unsub's spree started two weeks ago, when Grayson was out of town.
Clara:

The placement company pulled his visa after we told them about his history of assault.
If that's how you choose to run an investigation.
- [Clears throat] _ _
Maybe it's time we find a new liaison.
It's just pride.
He'll settle.

We need to know how the unsub's finding his victims.
Maybe we can find some common denominator that would explain where they crossed with each other or with him.
You got it.
The timeline of the killings has accelerated, but the disposal method remains the same, so, ritual is important to him, as well as this area.
Jessica's body was dumped less than two blocks away from here.
Head over to the Seoul sanitation department, see if you can track Barbara's original dump site to this location.
Maybe we can confirm this as the unsub's only dumping ground so we can get to work on a Geo-profile.
Simmons:

That's two blocks from where they found Jessica and three blocks from where Elsa was dumped.
Makes our unsub's dumping ground four square blocks.
That's a fairly confined comfort zone.
Yeah, he's at ease here.
It makes me think he lives or works here.
Well, it may also be where he hunts.
Monty and I have been looking for a connection between the victims, and I think we may have found one.
Hoenamu-Ro 46.
According to credit card activity,
Barbara got flowers twice a week from a place called Red Petal flowers.
And there's Jessica.

And Elsa worked at a clothing boutique,
Nina's, on the exact same road.
Given the time it would take to mutilate the victims' faces, our unsub had to hold them for a few hours prior to killing and dumping them.
Right.

Considering both victims were stalked and dumped in the same location, I'd say there's a good chance that it's nearby.
Here.

[Cell phone beeps]
Monty, I'm about to send you a picture of a city block in Seoul's Itaewon District.
I need you to get intel on all the buildings in it.
Monty:

♪ ♪
Well, I think that the perimortem mutilations are actually extreme forms of plastic surgery.
So, because there was no decomp this time,
I was able to get a better look, and originally,
I thought that the victims' jaws were just crushed by, like, a vice.
But now I can tell that incisions were made into the mandible bone itself, suggesting that a T-osteotomy was performed to increase the pointiness of the victim's chin.
That's a cosmetic procedure?
Yeah, for those who want a more delicate jawline.
Yeah.
Her nostrils were slashed with some type of scalpel, and the skin was peeled back.
And I have evidence that the septal cartilage was shaved down, as well.
- That would be a rhinoplasty.

And finally, we have the eyes.
Both lids were removed, which I believe is to mimic a blepharoplasty or a double eyelid surgery.
And I also found slashes and self-dissolving stitches in the corners of her eyes, which would suggest an epicanthoplasty, or an eye-widening surgery.
Stitches.

Yeah, I feel like it's a refinement.
Well, Seoul is considered the plastic surgery capital of the world.
Those eye surgeries are a common high-school graduation gift for girls, not considered a big deal.
It's like getting a nose job for your sweet 16.
But it's not just about vanity.
Many South Koreans equate beauty with success.
A lot of job résumés, they require a photo attachment.
The culture is steeped in it, so we might be looking at a South Korean for this.
And considering the skill needed to operate on these victims,
I would guess that the unsub's 35 to 45 years old.
And the use of the self-dissolving stitches and the surgical cuts points to him being a doctor.
Any evidence of sexual abuse?
No.

So, I'm thinking our unsub gets off on altering women's faces.
That would explain the lack of sexual assault.
Which means we could be looking for a psychosexual sadist who releases his impotence and indulges his desire for control by sculpting his victims' faces, you know, creating his version of the perfect woman.
Before tossing them into the trash.
[Cell phone rings]
Go ahead, Monty.
So, I did a quick search of all the structures located on the unsub's anchor block, and I found a bank, a 24-hour drug store, and a four-story mixed-use building with 75 units.
The unsub dumped all the bodies in the early morning.
Makes me think he mutilates them at night.
He'd need privacy, which he wouldn't get at a bank or a drug store open all night.
So, you're thinking the mixed-use building.
Me, too.

I can't access the private deed holders.
That has to be done in person at the property management office in Han-Gngno 50.
Clara, grab Joon-ho and get over there.
See if anyone on the deed fits the profile.
Simmons and I'll head toward the buildings and start knocking on doors until you narrow it down.
Clara:

It was taken back off the market after it didn't sell in the past year.
So, it's currently vacant?
Yep, and it is a top-floor unit with a private elevator.
Sounds like a good bet for a lair.
The deed came back to a Geonwoo Lee.
He's a South Korean citizen.
Joon-ho says that there's an extradition request still standing for him.
We know what for?
Two years ago, he was accused of assault on a prostitute in Dubai.
But he fled the country before the cops could get there.
He cut her with a razor, Jack.

Finding your grandma's been hard, huh?
Yeah.

A lot of records were lost in the war.
So, I'm thinking, after all this,
I may just go back with you guys.
You're really gonna put finding your long-lost Korean grandmother on the back burner?
Well, I got to get back to Kristy and the kids.
Matt, you make your living tracking killers, people who don't want to be found, and you're really telling me you can't find your grandmother in a country the size of Indiana?
If you ask me...
Which I didn't.
Right.

[Chuckles]
Okay.
I'll bite.

'Cause you're scared.
Of rejection.
You're scared that if you do find her, she may want nothing to do with you, just like your dad's parents didn't want to have anything to do with you because your mother was Korean.
Well, why would my grandmother want anything to do with me?
I mean, she abandoned my mother in a Korean orphanage.
I-I don't even understand why my mom asked me to do this in the first place.
She spent most of my life trying to forget she was even born here.
Well, people change.
Maybe your mother's idea of this place did, too.
I mean, Matt, it was your mother's dying wish for you to find her.
Did you really just read me at a crime scene?
Hey.
Profiler's gonna profile.

Hey, come take a look at this.
Red Petal Flowers.
Shine Sparkle Nails.
And Nina's.

Yep.

It's the perfect observation post.
- And, oh, so convenient.

It would require patience, though, which is in conflict with the aggression he showed towards his victims.
There's no sign of a blitz attack, so how did he lure them up here?
That's a good question.
You know, the way the bodies were dumped, it speaks to someone who's sophisticated, organized.
And this room speaks to someone who's disorganized.
I mean, it's a mess.

We're missing something.
Okay, Jack, I got some info on Geonwoo Lee, and let me tell you, he is a piece of work.
He is the only son of one of the richest men in Korea, Sang Lee, who made billions in the pharmaceutical industry after retiring as a very successful plastic surgeon.
Interesting.
I know, right?
So, according to school records, Geonwoo went to Eton and then to Cambridge.
He majored in economics and was excelling, some of his professors even referring to him as brilliant.
That was until school officials found his collection of hardcore porn and snuff films and then kicked him out his senior year.
What's he been doing since?
Not much other than providing reams of material for Korean gossip sites, mostly between him and women.
I see a series of failed engagements, some very bad behavior.
One of his exes did come out and report that he asked her to get cheek and chin implants to resemble one of his favorite anime characters.
And she did it.

The guy should come with a warning label.
He should, yeah, but he doesn't.

She's a pop star or something, at least in Korea.
Looks like she was having trouble breaking Stateside, so her label taught her some Korean and repackaged her as a K-Pop singer.
He single "Come Make Me a Woman"
shot to the top of iTunes Asia charts last year.
All right.

See if he was in the area during the time of the murders.
On it.
Geonwoo Lee just bought a new loft in the Myeong-dong District.
He may be there now.

He's just getting dressed.
We'll wait.
Can I get anybody coffee?
Oh, they're not staying.
I'm Senior Inspector Joon-ho Kim with Seoul PD.
These are Special Agents Garrett and Seger from the FBI.
The FBI?

Yeah, that's us.
We need you to come with us downtown.
Oh, we're heading out to dinner.
I, uh, prefer to drop by tomorrow, sometime after noon.
Your preference is irrelevant.
You're a person of interest in the murders and mutilation of three women.
- Geon, why would they...

Fine.

Push the reservation an hour and, uh, have a martini waiting.
Let's go.
It's my duty to remind you that you have a right to an attorney.
Maybe you want the same one who got you out of that Dubai mess?
Oh, I don't need to bother him with this.
You don't seem worried that we're looking at you for three murders.
Why would I be worried?
We have evidence that three women were tortured in your office unit along with your fingerprints and your DNA.
Which would make sense, considering I used to work out of there.
Used to.
There was no evidence of forced entry, and that would suggest that whoever was using it had a key.
The property company told me you had all the keys, that you were handling the sale yourself, so nobody else would have had access.
It's a very compelling mystery.
So, how did you two meet?
Oh, it's the most amazing story.
So, about a year ago, I was performing over at Z.A. Korea, and I guess Geon was in the audience.
[Chuckles] And since his father, he, like, owns the place or something,
Geon felt comfortable just walking into my dressing room after the show.
Like, he didn't even knock. [Chuckles]
I was barely dressed, so...
Wow.

It was... surprising, like him.
[Chuckles]
He said he had to take me to dinner that night.
It wasn't even a request, you know?
And, um, that's when I knew.
Knew what?
That he was the one.
That he would take care of me forever.
And he did. [Clicks tongue]
My Prince Charming.
Is it true that you encouraged most of the women in your life to undergo cosmetic procedures?
Now that I think about it, I guess so.
I mean, if I'm going to be staring at the same face for a few hours a day, I better like it, right?
I mean, he hasn't asked me to do much, if... if that's what you're asking.
Of course, I can't drink coffee anymore after he paid for these veneers.
[Chuckles] But that's okay.
Geon says caffeine makes me jittery.
And he likes me calm.
I mean, sometimes he says that I could have bigger, you know.
But why guy doesn't right?

I mean, now I get filler in my lips, but, like, everybody does that.
Geon says he likes when they look pump.
Makes him want to bite them off.
What am I looking at here?

Barbara Walker, Jessica Townsend, and Elsa Byquist.
And why am I looking at them?
So we can see your reaction.
And your lack of reaction tells me you're more than capable of something like this.
Maybe do.
Where were you two nights ago between the hours of 10:00 PM and 2:00 AM?
In bed.
With Lauren.
Would you like the details?
Just ask her.
Lauren:

He was with me all night, right here.
All night.
And there's no chance that he snuck out while you were sleeping?
No, no.
Because I didn't...

Insomnia, you know?
Hmm.

Uh, it's kind of off and on, so...
Lauren, I think you're lying to me.
Geonwoo was supposed to be with you, but he wasn't.
That's why you couldn't sleep.
You know, missing fiancés are often a common cause of insomnia.
He wasn't missing.

Bet he does that a lot, right?
Sneaks out in the middle of the night?
And when he finally comes home, you ask him where he's been, and the answer's always the same.
Business.
But it's not business.
It is business.
What else could it be?
Inspector, you're making a mistake.
You sure you want to do this?
Look at your American boss here.
Even he doesn't think I did it.
Do you?
_ _
[Door opens]
_ _
I can take it from here.
Thank you for your help.
Inspector Kim,
I know you don't want to hear this, but Geonwoo's correct.
I don't believe he did this.
But he has no alibi.
He's the only one with the access to the space where three women were tortured and killed, and he has a history of abuse.
What else do you need?
Geonwoo's a dominant assertive who enjoys the power he has over women.
Seduction is part of the game.
But my team established that the person who did this stalks their victims while trying to remain hidden.
It's the opposite of what Geonwoo would do.
So, you think he's innocent?
No, I think he's a sociopath, a sadist who's connected to all this in some way.
I just don't know how yet.
But a rush to judgment can obscure the path to justice.

I can't say I'm not surprised Joon-ho didn't listen to you.
His concern over our involvement in the case is clouding his judgment.
Simmons:

You were right, Jack.
He does have a history with Geonwoo.
Yeah, I thought their exchange at the end seemed personal.
What's the connection?
Well, he's been after him ever since he was in vice and Geonwoo was accused of cutting a prostitute when he was 15.
So, Joon-ho thinks he's finally landed his white whale.
Too bad he's wrong.

Mae:

Wait, you're saying Geonwoo's alibi is that he was cheating on his fiancée?
It appears so.
Well, why would Geonwoo lie about his alibi when it can be so easily proven?
Simple.

And he assumed Lauren, a dependent with low self-esteem who has connected her entire self-worth to the man would never negate what he says.
It's hard to believe he didn't give it up once they took him into custody.
He's just amusing himself, waiting to turn that card over until it would most embarrass Joon-ho.
Okay.

What is going on?
Someone wants us to think that Geonwoo is guilty of these crimes, even though he's not.
I think he's being framed.
Yeah, but who would do that.
Well, considering his scorched-earth policy with women, it could be an ex...
You know, somebody's he's wronged, somebody who expected more from him.
Has he ever been engaged?
Numerous times.
[Cell phone beeps]
Monty, I need you to get me a list of all of Geonwoo's broken engagements or any other high-profile breakups
- with South Korean women.

We thought that the way the bodies were dumped spoke to an organized male offender, and considering that 90% of all serial killers are male, it was a pretty good bet...
But now I'm thinking the way the bodies were dumped plus the chaos we found in the lair, that suggests a disorganized female offender.
And females usually take more care in disposing of the bodies, whether they're organized or disorganized.
If we are looking at one of Geonwoo's exes for this, then what's the mutilation of the victims' faces all about?
There's no psychosexual reason for it.
Well, he had a history of demanding that his girlfriend's physically alter themselves.
So, maybe the unsub is a women that he encouraged to do the same, and these victims are some type of self-surrogates.

Okay, I have two possibilities.
One, Eun-chae Pak, is a lingerie model.
She was engaged to Geonwoo back in 2010.
The other is Su-bin Yoo.

She was engaged to Geonwoo about a year ago.
Either of them have a history of getting plastic surgery once they became involved with him?
Uh, medical records will take a minute, but while we're waiting, get this...
Su-bin Yoo used to work for the same real-estate company that sold Geonwoo the lair office.

Yeah, but why?
Who is it?

Mae:

Based on Lauren's Twitter feed, it seems that she started dating Geonwoo while he was still engaged to Su-bin.
Well, that'd piss her off.
Didn't Geonwoo and Lauren just announce their engagement?
What if Su-bin found out that he had moved on to Lauren, a blonde with naturally Caucasian features, like the one Geonwoo has pressed so many of his ex-girlfriends to have, including probably Su-bin?
Well, that would explain her choice of blondes.
They're surrogates for the competition.
[Groans]
I don't know.

Those stitches that I found in Elsa's face suggested a refinement.
I don't think that these mutilations are just sadistic bloodlust.
I think she was practicing for her true competition.
Lauren.
[Muttering in Korean]
I was just allowed access to Su-bin's Korean medical records.
I've got evidence of extensive plastic surgery.
Sending you photos now.
Wow.

Simmons:

Well, that explains why she stalked her victims from the inside.
No one will go near her looking like that.
It would also explain why she dropped off the Internet.
Mae:

Eye-widening surgery, several nose jobs.
Her chin was shaved down.

First operation took place three weeks before Geonwoo broke up with her.
What if she did all of this for him?
The results weren't perfect, so he dumped her.
[Muttering in Korean]
Breakup probably triggered some type of body dysmorphia, and so she continued to have these procedures despite the fact that they were destroying her face.
So, she's a trauma-induced revenge-driven sadist exorcising her own pain while also hoping to make Geonwoo suffer.
[Screams]
Knowing Geonwoo, I bet he wasn't gentle with her.
Probably made her feel ruined.
Explains why the bodies were left by the trash.
It wasn't just a countermeasure.
It's symbolic.

What is she saying?
"I make them pretty like me." Over and over.
Tell her to drop the knife, or she will get shot.

Oh, my gosh.
What did you pack in these things?
[Chuckles] Uh, rocks or books.
I can't remember.

Inspector.
Agents.
I owe you an apology.
You were right.
I rushed to judgment.
We understand this wasn't the first time you've crossed with Geonwoo.
No.

But that doesn't excuse the fact that I refused to listen, and that almost cost another innocent women her life.
Inspector Kim, we all agree that Geonwoo's a terrible person who deserves to pay for what he did.
Which is why I reached out to the Ambassador.
Geonwoo's being extradited to Dubai as we speak.
He'll face charges for what he did to that woman plus extra penalties because he's a fugitive of the law.
He's gonna go away for a long time.
You are as good as they say.
[Chuckles] I'll remember that next time we meet.

Well, I don't see any bags.
You staying?
Uh, yes.
And don't make me say you were right.
No need.

[Chuckles]
Yeah, I made a few calls.
We'll see what happens.
Good.

Me, too.
All right.
