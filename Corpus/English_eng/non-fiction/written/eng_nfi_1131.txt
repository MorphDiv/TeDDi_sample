- Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

Oh, God, I'm so worried about work today.
I wish I wasn't working at a hedge fund.
That's just first day of school jitters, okay?
You're going to be the smartest person in the place.

It's not that.

Oh, yeah.
- Oh, God, give it to me.

- Take it.

What was that?

No.

There's no way she's up this early.

You're right.
She's like a cat.
All she does is nap and eat.
Good morning, guys!
Shit.
Hey, what?
Hey.

- What time is it?

We're just waking up.

- What's happened?

Some early morning yoga, huh?
Yep. 6:30 a.m. class.
- Good for you.

That's wonderful.

Do you think she heard us?
What?

Hey, Marianne, I'm going to make some coffee.

Oh, yeah.
Give it to me.
Oh, give it to me.
- Okay.

And I am proud of you.
At least one of us is.

- Bye!

- I'm not evil!

I'm so nervous.

Opening night of your play!

- Yeah, me too!

- I need a huge favor.

I need you to take Anastasia to the vet for a check-up.
I'd do it, but I'm the only point person between the YMCA and production.
- Sure.

You're the best.
I'll text you the doctor's information.
- Okay.

Have a good day.

Okay.
Alright, Anastasia, time to read Hunger Games:

What?

You're FaceTiming me!
Damn it.

Don't.

No, this is...

Hello.

I don't have time to figure this out right now.
We have... to talk about the... night.
I can't understand you.

The other night was almost a disaster!
Jesus Christ, bring it down.
I don't like the phone.

- Hello?

- Cool.

- Bye!

Here's the deal with FaceTime - everybody can see our faces!
Yeah, okay...

Just make sure it's somewhere no one knows us.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Welcome, madam.
I'll tell my master you've arrived.
I am not eating here.
You said pick a place where we would not be recognized.
Fair enough.
It's weird, there's no internal consistency here.
Some of the food here is monster themed and some of it... is it Tex-Mex?
The other night was crazy.
And not in a good way.
I know, I'm sorry.

I feel awful.
We're bad people.
- Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.

My husband was in the next room.
Your wife was downstairs.
- My children were asleep in their beds.

What happened to the "let's just be friends" plan?
I don't know what to say.
This has been going on for so long, I have no idea what to tell you.
I'm not proud.
All I know is I can't sleep... thinking about our kiss.
I... will admit, it was a good one.
Right?
Hey!

Ethan Turner!
- Hey.

I was the year below you at Harvard.
- Yes!

- Yes, alright!

- We're here for his birthday.

You look familiar.

- Nope.

Just went to the school of hard knocks.
It's great to see ya.
- Alright, yeah.

- Yeah.

See you later!
- How is he younger than me?

His son has a mustache.

- Your soul belongs to me now!

God, is there anywhere in New York City where we're safe?
Say it with me.

It's alive!
We have to get out of here.
I'm glad you're here.

Well, from what I read, the new SEC regulations can be quite complex.
They can be.
We also deal with our fair share of sexual harassment claims.
Sexual harassment from where?
Within the firm.
The culture here at Blackstool is quite... masculine.
I don't mean to bias you, but it's better that you know.
Well, I used to work for the ACLU defending Neo-Nazis' freedom of speech, so I think I'm going to be okay.
Have you been to Scores?
Scores, the strip club?
Yes.
No, I don't think I have.
You will go.
Okay, great.
I want to make sure we're on the same page with the new regulations.
- You must be Lisa.

I thought you should hear this.

Oh, yeah, I think we are on the same page, you fucking cocksucker!
Fuck you!

Sorry, they put it on mute.
They really like this joke.
You fucking bitch!
I love it.

- The SEC imposes on...

I missed that.

- I hope for more transparency...

Bruce!
- Bruce!

Lay it on him, Brucie!
- Come on!

I'm sorry, I didn't know they were going to be doing this bit.
- I love that thing!

- Hello.

Hey, we actually have a little treat.
Lisa Turner's our new in-house counsel.

Yeah, hello.

I look forward to working with you, too.
Call him a fucking pussy.
- What?

- Now that we've gone over that...

- You can do it.

- You don't understand.

- You can hear him, but...

No, thank you.
- Thank you, no.

My only question is... how big are your dad's balls?
- What was that?

- Sorry.

- I'm so sorry, Mike.

Yeah, we heard a weird thing.
- Did you talk about my dad's balls?

So you went to Harvard?
Yeah.
- I went to Princeton.

Little help.
We're just here to talk.
Yeah, totally.

- Wait one second.

God, I want you against the wall!
You don't have to say it.

You're like a sex narrator.
Oh, no.

Wait, what?

Well, we change it sometimes.

Okay, why is it going faster?
Jon doesn't know I'm here.
If security comes, he'll know.
Oh, God.

I think the code's on one of these.
Is it this?

What?

Does it look like a security code?

I was looking for something laminated.

She's very good for her age.

You know what?

Right!
- What are you doing?

No, it doesn't!

The chair is on the outside.
It looks like a break-out!
Oh, God.

That's the security company.
We have three minutes till they get here.

Wait!

- I live here!

Wait a sec.
What are you doing?

- Do you have a menstrual cramp?

So call her back at a more opportune time!
I can't.

No, I know what regulations are.

Say fuck the regulations like I fucked his wife.
Fuck your regulations like my friend fucked your wife.
- Like you did.

Hey, babe!
How was your first day at the hedge fund?
Well, you know how I thought it was going to be horrible?

Look, a fucked-up dick.
- That's great!

That's awful.

It's like a really bad place.

You are not a bad person.
No, I didn't say that I was a bad person.

Neither did I. I said you were not.
I'm sorry, I don't know why I keep getting hung up on this.

What can I do?

Well, I mean, you can come into the city and take me for lunch.
It'd be nice to see the face of a decent human being.
I wish that I could, but I'm...
I'm still at the vet with Marianne's rabbit.
It's nice of you to take care of it.
What's that beeping sound?
The beeping?

Jesus, is she going to be okay?
- Yeah.

Well, I'm going to see you for drinks with Nick before Marianne's play, right?
What's happening?
Shit's going down with a pit bull, Rottweiler, Doberman, chow mix!
I've got to go, honey.

- It's straight-up cartoon shit.

Everything's fine.

What...
I don't give a fuck!
Fuck you!
Yeah, I'll hold.
Marianne loved this rabbit.
This might have been her best friend.
- I'm her best friend!

She'll still be devastated.

Are you crazy?

What should I do?
Return the body to Marianne and apologize for killing the rabbit.
That's what a good person would do.
Or would a good person find an identical rabbit to spare Marianne the pain?
That's not good.

That's right, you got a C in moral reasoning.
I'm covering both of our asses and that's altruism.
You're such a strict Kantian.

If I tell Marianne the truth, it's going to blow up our lives!
I don't like it!
Every one of your fixes creates new problems.

- And you lash out when you're at fault.

You're right.
You're totally 100 percent right.
We're going to tell Marianne the truth and return Anastasia's body.
You're making me really nervous.

Yeah, well, it's hard to dig a hole with your bare hands.

- We've got to go!

Okay.

Goodbye.

- Come on!

So what we're looking for is a rabbit that looks just like that.
- Oh, you're looking for a Hotot?

There we go.

That's a New Zealand white.

This girl's going to fill out to be ten, maybe 12 pounds.
Will she gain five pounds in the next five hours?

No.
But she doesn't have the black rings around her eyes.
Very good!

We have no Hotots.
We take the rabbit back, then go to the play.
- Yeah.

It's fine.

- Jesus, Sam.

We're past the cruelty-free conversation.
You know what?
- I don't know what I'm doing any more.

Marianne will never know the difference.
Put it back in its cage so you don't kill another one.
Are you not concerned at all?
Of course I'm concerned!

I don't understand.

Have you ever cheated on somebody before?
No!

- Have you?

What kind of person do you think I am?
I don't understand what's going on.

I don't know.
It's just... it's lasted for so long.
When we started, it wasn't cheating.
No, we were just two kids hooking up.
You were the second person I was ever with.
It's like your vagina is imprinted on my brain.
- We're good people.

We're such bad people.
Okay, Ethan just bailed on drinks.
He's a loser, anyway.
- Yeah.

Screw that guy!
Oh, God.

The people that I work with, they're so terrible.
They're evil people.

Well, on the bright side, their kids will be fuck-ups like me.
- What?

Look, it's not your fault that you have a trust fund.

Yeah, you're right.

- I wouldn't go that far.

- No, listen.

Listen, if I had a ton of money, I wouldn't do anything, either.
Thank you.

Because you're, like, the type of person that has to have meaning in their life.
You do, too, you just don't realize it because you're too busy sleeping with a rotating harem of beautiful women that are half your age.
Okay.

- Okay?

It's more of like a sexual mentorship, for example.
- What?

Thank you.
Jesus.
Hey, can I have one of those?
I corrupted you.
No, I am too old to be corrupted.
Yeah, we'll see about that.
Is that what you're wearing to Marianne's play?
You got a different idea?
I might.

I mean, it is opening night.
We do kind of need to be fancy.
Fancy pantsy.
We're a little early.

Marianne's play better be good.
A reverse gender production of Streetcar?

Wow.
- What a nightmare of a day.

So stressful.
So stressed.
My shoulders are, like, up to my ears.
- I need a release.

I'm all, like, tense physically.
I feel like I'm going to explode.
- No.

No, we can't.
No.
It's a button fly.

We should stop doing this.
Right now.
- Shit!

Sorry to interrupt.
But it's illegal to have sex in public.
We weren't having sex.
I can see your wee-wee.
- Oh, my God.

Well, I can see you, so yes.
Officer, are you going to arrest us?
No.

Is there any way that we could pay that fee right now?
Nope.

Is there a way for you to not mail it?
Can you email us the summons instead?
Nope.

Okay.

I live in a different borough, so...
Do you want me to arrest you?
- No.

- No, actually, mail's perfect.

Now, tell me this.

Yeah, it was, but I think it was worth it.
Nice.
- My lady.

I thought I was going to be here alone.
No.
- We're here.

- We're ready.

- Thank you.

- What are you wearing?

- It's a night out on the town.

Are you guys drunk?
- What?

- It's not.

Oh, wow.
Is this the show?

Is there a silent monologue?

- Good luck, Marianne.

I feel like you do this preparation before you come on stage.
- Yes.

It's just the preamble here.

It's happening?
Feels like you would already have that on stage.
It could've started there, yeah.
This is about sisters.

Hey, sweetie.

It's okay.

Were you wearing this this morning?
- I was not.

Oh, my gosh.
- You married?

What happened?
He...

Sorry, I got held up at work.

Hi, Sam.
- Good to see you, Sam.

So the guys are girls and the girls are guys?
Yes.
- You shush!

Whoa!
Pick it up!
Pick it up!
- Whoa.

If they just walked normally, they'd be less noticeable.
I hope this part never ends.
Oh, hell.
- Stay away from me.

It's the middle of the scene.
- Break down upon your head.

Why do they take such small steps?
You want to play in the dirt, dirty girl?
Oh, no.
I feel like typically, the rape is implied.
I mean, can guys even rape this long?
I have no idea.

Well, you're a guy.
- Max, stop talking, she can see us.

The lights are in her eyes and we're in the dark.
- Good job.

- I don't know.

- Don't thumbs up her rape.

- Is this still happening?

That's probably it.
You were both excellent in the show.

Oh, thank you.

I am also Frank Langella.
- Hey, guys.

- We loved it.

Amazing!
You were so good.
Ethan, how did everything go with Anastasia?
Great!

- She's alive and well.

- Yeah.

Marianne, we have a half an hour to strike this set.
Oh, God.

Thanks for coming.

Hey, thank you for saving an otherwise horrible evening.
You are more than welcome, my lady.
- You're the best.

- You're the best.

Goodbye, you guys!
- Goodbye, guys!

- I'm going to jump on the snack table.

Bird for three!
- Oh, my God.

Oh, honey.
Do I make a beautiful bride?
Yes, as beautiful as our wedding day.
I did not have a very good first day.
I do not like Blackstool.
My phone.

It's not working.
I'll get it.

I'm really sorry that I wasn't there for you today.
- That's okay.

Marianne's apartment... looks a lot bigger when it's spinning.
Let's get you out of these clothes.
I want to go to sleep now.
You're going to get cold.
There we go.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Hey.

No.

Weird how?
I don't know, it's like she's another bunny.
She's acting really lethargic.
The vet gave her Vicodin.
Bunny Vicodin.

I wish he hadn't done that.

Horrible.
- Thanks so much for taking care of her.

- You're a really good guy, Ethan.

- You're the best.

- You're the best.

- Night.

- Anastasia.
