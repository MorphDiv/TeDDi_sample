I found it.
What about this tweed jammer for the doctor's appointment?
Stop Googling.
I'm gonna put a parent lock on your computer.
Why don't you put a lock on this?
Hey, does this make you wanna cure my cancer?
Go back in there, Arsenio Hall.
If I were just to throw this on casually?
Who throws on a beret casually?
Okay, this oncologist is no joke.
She was on "Oprah."
This is Dr. Leslie Rollins.
She is legit the best of the best.
Well, that puts even more pressure on what I'm gonna wear.
You know what, let's stop by T.J. Maxx,
Maggie, I need an Oprah-level blazer.
All I've got in here is, like, Steve Harvey at best,
I don't know why you don't understand.
I do understand.
Are we losing our mind a little bit?
I don't know if you've seen, uh, my binder.
I made you a little binder, baby girl.
"Cancer, you wanna roll with this?"
When did you go to Paper Source?
There's one in Rhode Island that's open till 10:00.
It's got personalized tabs for appointments or research, or if you wanted to put various pamphlets in, or take notes.
Cancer ain't got nothing on these tabs.
Okay.
I just need to figure out what candle to give her.
Oh, my God, you got her a gift?
That's weird!
Always Be Bringing Gifts.
Okay, that's not the phrase.
Okay, so we've got Scent of Papaya...
'Cause nobody wants to smell that.
♪ Hey, remember when. ♪
♪ Doo-doo, doo-doo. ♪
♪ Back before we were brittle. ♪
♪ Back before we were brittle. ♪
I just kinda feel like I'm gonna throw up.
I'm Dr. Rollins.
I'm Maggie, her, uh, best friend.
Sorry, I don't mean to be crying so soon.
No, no, you... no, let the tears flow.
This is a safe place.
This is a little overwhelming, isn't it?
I was gonna wear a beret, and then Maggie said no.
She's doing good, though, right?
And the even better news is you found the lump, so now we get to do something about it,
I'm gonna tell you what I know.
If I talk too fast, you let me know.
So it looks like the tumor is only about two centimeters.
It does mean we have to do surgery.
Oh.
But we have a couple of options.
We can do a lumpectomy, which means I take just the lump, leave the rest of the breast, or we do a double mastectomy, meaning we take both the breasts.
Okay, um, well, what's gonna keep me the most alive?
I have a one-year-old daughter, and...
I mean, she's not my daughter...
I need to make sure that I'm here for her.
Research shows that a lumpectomy plus radiation is just as effective as a double mastectomy.
But what would you do if you were me?
Every case is different, but with these results, and your age, and the fact that you have a toddler at home,
You don't wanna think about it?
I don't know if you've seen this binder, but it says, "Cancer, you wanna roll with this?"
I had all these questions, but she answered most of them.
All right, you know what, forget... here, this is my cell.
And no Googling.
Can you say that one more time?
No, okay, I get it.
Um, I just have one more question.
Yeah?
Uh, do you think I'm gonna kick it?
Um, I think you're gonna kick cancer's ass.
You're gonna be there to dance at Charlotte's wedding.
We're not gonna force those kinda decisions on her.
Hey, FYI, you might to get to keep your nips, right?
She's really proud of her nipples.
Oh, my God... well... they're just the perfect ratio of areola to nipple.
Oh, well in that case, let's go see Dr. Meredith, to pick out the perfect boobs for the perfect nips.
Yeah, they're really not much to speak of.
By the time I'm done with them, you're gonna have to sell tickets...
She's gonna give you the boobs of your dreams.
I really like the sound of that.
Okay, good, 'cause what Dr. Rollins and I do... it's called a one-step reconstruction.
So she's gonna scoop out all of the breast tissue, and then right away,
I'm just gonna put in your brand new implants.
I'm the scooper, she's the boober.
It's like Cold Stone Creamery.
Okay, let's put our fingers on some boobies.
Um, okay, uh...
Just really feel it.
I don't really touch my boobs that much, so I don't really know.
Kay.
Kay.
Hm...
Mm-mm.
It's number two.
It's number two!
All right.
I'm not bringing this smelly bag to the hospital.
I Febrezed the whole thing.
I don't know where this has been, and I don't wanna be a part of it.
Smell it.
Don't go all out for me.
I just wanted to keep your feet warm.
I also wanted to protect the doctors from your sharp toes, 'cause they're not ready for that.
"Oh, my veins, squirt, squirt, squirt," you know.
I just don't want anybody getting cut.
I had to bring it back to the old school.
Oh, my God, one of your classic mixes.
DJ Mark, 99.7.
The Crush.
So you got that, and then of course... let me see... we got the, uh... my policeman sweatshirt, which you've been bogarting anyways, so there you go.
All right, so, uh, I will be by tomorrow to pick you guys up at 6:15 a.m.
Oh, do you want a police escort?
No, I actually, um......
I think that, uh,
I can't have you there tomorrow.
'Cause I was thinking about it, and I...
I really need to just be strong, you know, and just, like, get it done, and I'm afraid if I see you...
That I'm gonna cry, and I don't wanna...
I don't wanna do that tomorrow.
Absolutely, honey, whatever you need.
Okay.
Whatever you need.
Yeah, I could use another one of those warm blankets.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm gonna do a special nurse trick.
Ooh, I like seeing you do your work, girl.
Where my girls at?
All right, you excited to meet your new boobs?
First thing's first, all right.
Settle this for us.
What kind music should we play during the surgery?
You're not gonna hear it, but we usually do Cyndi Lauper.
She's really going through a real Pat Benatar phase
Oh, okay, you wanna do the sexy witch thing?
The anesthesiologist just left, and he said it would take a little while for the drugs to kick in.
I'm just mark up your breasts real quick here.
Your gown.
How long is the surgery gonna last?
It's gonna be about four hours.
Do you guys stop for snacks?
Ma-Maggie, did you bring snacks for them?
I didn't.
I could run out and grab something.
I like to have a turkey hoagie right in the middle of surgery,
What's that now?
We're focused on you, and only you.
Okay, well, hoagies, I love you, guys.
Uh-oh, okay, looks like the drugs are kicking in.
Hello?
You guys are hoagies.
She's a really pretty nurse, guys.
She's gonna do great.
Gonna go get the show on the road.
Okay, little hoags.
Uh... so, um, looks like they're kicking me out, so I'm gonna get out of here, but you're gonna do so great, and I'm gonna be there right when you wake up, okay?
Okay, I love you, Mama.
I love you too.
Okay.
What are you guys doing here?
Since Mark wasn't allowed to come, he asked us to come instead.
Permission to hug?
Granted.
Okay, guys, I'm gonna need backup.
'Cause if there's anything you need,
Thank you.
You want some reading material?
I looked through one of these magazines.
They had pictures of kitchens.
I know women like kitchens, so...
Let's find some more kitchens.
I'm a lonely troll, and I have to kill orcs in order to get more gold for my clan.
Oh, no, that's an orc attack.
Paul, she doesn't wanna hear about your game.
But they'll take my village.
Her friend is in surgery.
Oh, Maggie, if you're hungry,
I brought some smoked meats.
I call it Ian's Song of the South.
You might wanna change that.
Um, it's tempting.
Oh, we can stretch 'em for you.
Yeah, we'll stretch your legs.
I'll stretch my own legs, but thank you.
All right.
We'll just hold down the fort then.
Turn off that... turn off that phone.
Hey, Maggie...
Hey.
Look, I was trying to find you.
I just dropped in on the operating room, and it's going really well.
We got her halfway through, and she's doing great.
That is... that is a relief.
How are you doing?
You know, I'm great.
Just chilling.
'Cause this can be pretty hard.
Yeah.
"Why did I say that?" But I'd like to do something.
I would really like to be able to do something.
So I end up driving to Paper Source at 9:45 at night, buying a $78 pen, and a binder that's only gonna have one pamphlet in it.
Listen, Maggie, I just wanted to assure you that you're doing exactly what you should be doing, okay?
Because you found her the best doctors....
Yeah.
And I know you're saying the right things to her, because I've seen you guys together, and you know her better than anyone else.
And you're making sure that she gets treatment straight away, so...
Thank God she was so nosy.
She is a piece of work, right?
If you would knew the... the lengths that she would go to for me...
And you for her, clearly.
What is that?
You're getting better at this bedside manner thing.
Well, you know, I'm...
I'm sort of, um, practicing a bit.
Is that so?
Yeah, I did, uh, try it on one patient.
Maggie?
Is this man making you cry?
Okay, Doctor, carry on.
Stand down.
Sorry, so you have a police escort?
Emma and I taught the police force how to striptease.
Yes, Dr. Ericson, um, stopped by the operating room, and she's... everything's going great.
They... they... they have to really just... they gotta get it done.
I know.
Okay, you know who we're talking about, right?
Yeah.
You think that this is gonna take her down?
No way.
Not today.
All right, I think you should come inside with me.
No, she made it perfectly clear that she does not want me in there.
You know, you don't have to listen to her, right?
Yeah, that's the secret of our friendship... is that she just talks for a long time, and then I act like I'm listening, but then I just do whatever I want.
Oh, also, um, they got Shastas from, like, 1982 in this vending machine.
Wait a minute, they got straight Shastas up in here?
Straight Shastas.
Straight Shastas.
Pop that booty, booty, and move that freaking booty.
Yeah!
Since our strip show, I've been taking private lessons.
Well... it's paying off in spades.
So we got all the cancer out.
There's one thing.
It's just, um,
I underestimated how very small her actual breasts were.
We hadn't seen breasts that small since we operated on an old Sicilian grandmother.
She's gonna repeat that detail.
I had to make 'em a little bigger.
Do you think she's gonna be upset about that?
Oh, I think she'll be all right.
They're gonna be bigger, guys!
Oh, my God, I love you guys so much.
Aww.
You're welcome.
Hey.
Hey, Mags.
How'd it go?
We're gonna have to go bra shopping, 'cause they had to make 'em a little bigger,
Hey, do you know where my socks are?
No, no, no, no, I need my socks.
Hey.
I got bigger boobs.
Well, okay, yeah.
You can show those to me at another time.
Um, I know that you told me not to come...
No, you do have to listen to me.
I think those are the rules now.
Those are indeed the new rules.
I have cancer, so you have to do whatever what I say.
Just go get me my socks, please.
Okay.
Do you know where these socks are?
Mr. Rodriguez to the rescue.
These are just to put on her feet to protect anybody who comes by from her vicious sharp toes.
Stop saying... ow.
Emma Scissor-toes.
God, Channing Tatum is a physical specimen.
His abs should be in the Smithsonian.
I heard he likes to change diapers, like, all the time.
Hey, I wonder with my new titties,
Would that be okay with you, Mark?
You know, the moves are good.
The moves are really, really good, but he's no match for DJ Mark of 99.7.
The Crush.
Give me, give me, give me, give me.
Oh, no, no, you can't hold her.
Okay, okay, just put her down here, though, then, 'cause I gotta get a feel of that sweet, sweet baby skin.
Hey, Char, that's Channing Tatum.
Oh, she's seen this movie several times.
Excuse me?
What do you think we screen at 2:00 a.m.?
The Pony Dance puts her to sleep...
Is this, uh, "Toy Story 4"?
What?
