No, no, no!
No, no, in the red means there's a quarter of a tank left.
Isn't this a real shit burger?
Are you kidding?

Go around!
Idiot!
Come on!
Oh, my God.

Go around me!
We cannot pass.

Well, then I guess you're just gonna have to stay there, then.
Do you need some assistance?

Nope, I'm good.
I'm great!
I am trying to keep to a schedule.
That's rude.
Adulthood is where dreams go to die.
Grow up, get a job, become a drone.

Then it's over.
Society just wants to put everyone in a box.
Well, guess what, society.

'Cause, I mean, if I thought the rest of my life would be spent as a mindless cog in a machine,
I swear, I'd just get a tattoo across my face that says:
"Really, man?"
Just need to figure out a way of growing up without becoming a boring adult.
You wanna know what I think?
Everything you're saying is stupid.
Nuh-uh.

No, the stupid part is you whining about how awful growing up is.
I'm not whining.

Ow!

You just old-school slapped me.
Your generation is so fucked up.
I get it.

Neither did I. I drove.
How old do you think I am?
Okay, here's the thing.
I tried college for a year.

Everything you wanna learn, you could look up online.
I know how to open champagne with a sword.
How old are you, anyway?
Twenty-three.
Huh.
"Huh," what?
Hard to believe you're the future.
Thank God I'll be dead.
I like you, old lady.

Sophia!

Oh, you trying to reclaim that word?
No, it's just fun to shout across a room.
So, get this.

- A turtle.

A bleeding man.
Not a guessing game.
An eviction notice.
- Yes, stupid eviction notice.

Told my landlord I'm not paying rent until they fix my plumbing, and he's a real douche about it.

I'll tell you what I would do.
You gotta move back in with that hot dad of yours.
No.

Hey, Dax!

- Please.

- Since when?

- My new lover.

So, Sophia here needs a vodka and cranberry to promote urinary tract health.
And I'm gonna switch from a martini to a Brandy Alexander.
- For real?

You know I gotta get the manual for that.
- Go.

When did that happen?
Last night.

We were just talking about the untimely death of Peter Jennings.
So sad.
And we started boning, right here on the bar, right where your arm is.
Annie, it says I need a nutmeg grater.
- Well, get grating.

No, you are, you are.

Um...
All right, your Kahlúa and Coke.
- With an olive.

I'm telling you, it's real love this time.
With Dax the bartender?
I know!

How was it?
How was his, uh, you know...?
Asshole?
Never mind.
'Cause his asshole was totally average.
His dick is huge.
I'm not really sure why you'd ask me about his asshole.
Who's that dude?
Oh, that's Shane, Dax's new roommate.
His dad runs a water park.
How do you know that?
'Cause that's, like, the coolest job that anybody's dad could ever have.
Hey, Dax, where's my drink?
Here, here's some bullshit.
Hey, little drummer girl!
What?
Shane.
He's building a water park in your panties.
Annie?

Well, for starters, I've been mixing alcohol all night.
- Mm-hmm.

Dax, too much nutmeg.
Thanks, guys!
Before we go, I just wanna remind everyone that the basic tenets of capitalism and democracy contradict each other.
Emmalou on theremin!
I'm gonna get a drink.

A guitar or a trombone.
A real fucking instrument.
Hey, buddy, Anchor Steam when you get a chance.
And a dark and stormy.
- Which is my new nickname for your...

- Why?

- What am I gonna start?

Oh!

Hey.
Hey.
Gotta get the shoes off first.

- Wanna grab that one?

I'll grab this one.
Okay.
Ohh.
All right, I'm good.
You are?
Yeah.
Did you...
Hmm?
get... get there somehow?
- What?

No, no.

Decided that, uh...
I'm done.
Oh, and I don't do one-night stands.
- Oh, that's a good rule.

Wow.

Is this pillow memory foam?
- Well, it's Tempur-Pedic.

It's what I imagine sleeping in a Popeyes biscuit feels like.
Could I crash here?
You seem so nice.
There's a real...
"I'd go to Africa to dig wells" kind of vibe about you.
Hmm?
Sure.
Hmm.
Any chance you have a sound machine?
- Uh, no.

Mm-mm.
Okay, this is gonna sound kind of crazy.
But could you just...

- Are you serious?

Hmm?
Okay.
That's nice.
Back to the waves.
Good morning.
I made you breakfast.
- Eating that will make your life shorter.

Ten?

Not yet.

Those shoes are ridiculous.
It's either wear these or get that surgery that makes your legs longer.
You know, the one that Gwyneth Paltrow had.
Ba-dum!
Ah.
I don't know why, but I like you.
You'll figure it out.
- Just watching Xbox.

Ah.

- You okay?

Yeah.

- Love you in case I die.

Heh.
- Hm.

Hey, Carol.
Oh.

- What do you mean?

So, naturally, I assumed you were hit by a bus and bleeding out onto Market Street.
Come on, Carol, I never take Market Street.
Okay.

I'm going to be running inventory in the back.
So, I need you to man the fort and sell those shoes, girlfriend.
Got it.
Drab.
Why put that on a hanger?
Polka dots?
Is that jacket lying in a dog bed?
- Dad!

Just calling to confirm dinner.

Look at you, Mr. Moneybags.
Ah, it's Restaurant Week, so we're getting a deal.
Hey, um, please show up.
- I don't want a repeat of last time.

Who knew this town had such a huge gay pride parade?
Welcome to Lush.

Why, no, sir.

Was that a personal call?
- It was.

I... am.
- You know it's against company policy.

- I do not know where to begin.

You are here to sell shoes, not to have Sophia time.
Is that my sandwich?
- I didn't know this was yours.

- Chicken?

So, they got the label wrong.

I just started my period.
Oh, I can feel it.
It's happening.

Textbook example of inappropriate workplace conversation.
Admit you knew it was my sandwich.
I did.

Son of a gun!
I'm sorry.

By law, I get an hour for lunch.
When a customer comes in, lunch hour ends.
Okay.

I decide when we move on.

This is the whole problem with you.

Hey!
I needed to eat and I'm not about to die of malnutrition just to push heels.
What's it to you?

You're just middle management on some power trip.
How about this for a power trip?
- You're fired!

- Yeah.

No.

- Okay.

I'm telling everyone I quit.
Hey, I quit, okay?

No, no.

Ugh!
Hey.
Yep.

You know, it...

God.

I mean, did I eat her sandwich?

But then she started yelling and...

Oh, Annie.
Shit!
Why am I such an asshole?
Uh, can you hold on for a sec?

Okay, it's gone.
Okay, we have to check all donated clothes for mouse turds.
Is that a problem?
Uh, it's the number one reason why people give us their clothes.
It's like, "Hey, white people, you think you'd never worn a shirt with mouse turds?
Think again."
Of course, my rescue dog is spayed.
I didn't wanna rob her of the joys of motherhood, so I had her legally adopt a litter of rescue pups.
Suck my balls.
This one has blood on it.
Just turn it inside out.
Oh.
If you'd read the latest study, you'd know that honey is great for your complexion, so, I've been eating bees, only the queens.
Found that out the hard way.
I want this.
- I'll give you eight bucks for it.

I only have eight.
- I think you're lying.

- You have shifty eyes.

I'll let you have it for ten.
Nine bucks...
- and some free business advice.

So, what's the advice?
This is an original 1970s East West calfskin motorcycle jacket in perfect condition.
Know what your shit's worth, 'cause you just got played.
Bam, son!
Hey!
- You know you're in a Dumpster?

Hi, ma'am.
I can help you with that.
Thank you.

You're gonna...
You're not.
Okay.
Park's closed.
You gotta go.
What time is it?
It's sundown.
Oh, fuck!
Oh, don't worry.
- The sun'll be back tomorrow.

Huh.

Heh.
This butter is in the shape of a shell.
I don't know how they did it, but gotta say, I'm impressed.
Good to see you.
Yeah.

- How are you?

Oh.

Hoping to be buried in it.
How's work?
Recently left the shoe biz, so, kind of between gigs right now.
Are you seeing anyone?
Nope.

- Shane.

Shane... what?
The drummer.
Can I get anything else for you, sir?
Uh, yeah, I'll take a refill on the Manhattan, and then bring another one right away.
Certainly.

Hmm.

Extra nutmeg.
Can I see some ID?
It's, uh... temporarily misplaced.
I'll go with a seltzer cranberry.
- Right away.

So, what's this?
This...

I... stole that earlier.
- Jesus.

Sophia, you smell like the street.
You got fired.

The best thing for you would be to move back home, so I can keep an eye on you.
- No way.

No, Dad.

I'm worried about you.
- Why?

Good!
- Adulthood is where dreams...

What exactly are these dreams of yours, huh?
Because you know what?

You've never given any indication to me... that you have 'em.
Sophia, you're young, smart.
You're pretty.

- I guess I'm just pissed off.

I don't know yet!
I don't know anything.
And I know that I'm supposed to, so, I'm gonna figure it out, Dad.

And I know that you don't believe me.
But it'd be so great if you did.
Sophia, wait.
Such bullshit.
Damn, you just ripped yourself a new taint.
You okay?
Well, unless you want the HPV, better close them damn legs, girl.
That shit is everywhere.
It's in the walls.
It's your daughter.
Call me.
Yeah.

Look at it on that hanger.
Whoa.
Bring on adulthood, motherfucker.
