50 years have passed.
But I do not age.
Time has lost its effect on me.
[ Exhales sharply ]
[ Laughs maniacally ]
Yet the suffering continues.
Aku's grasp chokes the past, present, and future.
Hope is lost.
Got to get back -- back to the past.
Samurai Jack.

[ Bird chirping ]
[ Crows caw ]
[ Woodpecker clicking in distance ]
Aaagh!
[ Grunting, gasping ]
[ Crows caw ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
[ Creak ]
Aah!
[ Dramatic music plays ]
[ Crows caw ]
No.
Murderer!
No!
They chose the path!
Theychose!
[ Crows click ]
[ Chain creaking ]
[ Birds chirp in distance ]
[ Growls ]
Why won't you die?
I will undo the evil that is you, samurai!
I will kill you!
As long as I have breath in my body,
I will strike you down!
Long live the glory of Aku!
You are very troubled.
And very confused.
Aku is the evil one, not me.
I've met machines that are programmed with such hate and lies, but never a human.
Now you're just repeating yourself.
[ Grunts, growls ]
I wonder if it is possible for her to ever believe that Aku is the evil and not me?
Lecherous snake!
Mm, perhaps not.
[ Rumbling ]
[ Creature roars ]
[ Dramatic music plays ]
[ Grunts ]
Are you kidding me?
[ Gasps ]
Jack: [ Grunts ]
[ Rumbling, growling ]
Whew.
[ Gasps ]
[ Coughs ]
[ Laughs maniacally ]
My Lord and master, Aku, may it please you for all eternity --
The samurai is dead.
Um...
I'm right here.
You're dead.
I've been inside giant creatures before.
I'll find a way out.
Yes, yes, I know -- till your dying breath.
But once you see how misguided you are, you will see the truth about Aku.
[ Footsteps approaching ]
[ Dramatic music plays ]
[ Creatures chattering ]
[ Creature roars ]
[ Creature growls ]
[ Creatures roar, growl ]
[ Screams ]
[ Creatures roaring ]

Be still!
Crazy woman!
Can you not see that I am saving your life?
Aaaaaagh!
Uh, hello?
[ Creatures growling ]
[ Blade clatters ]
[ Dramatic music continues ]
[ Creatures snarl, growl ]
[ Rumbling, growling ]
[ Electricity crackling ]
Ashi?
Ashi?
Kill the samurai!
[ Gasping ]
Jack?
What are we doing, Jack?
Waiting for what?
She's pure evil.
She's lost her way.
[Chuckles] You'd know about that, wouldn't you?
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
[ Blows ]
Well, then, maybe you'll talk to me.
Leave me alone.
I don't know why you keep bringing this up.
[ Creature growls lightly ]
Look, why do you always have to get involved?
She chose her way, and now she has to live with the consequences.
You'll never understand that it's all my fault!
She's here because of me.
[ Low growling ]
No.
Ugh, you're going to save her life again, aren't you?
Yes.
[ Dramatic music plays ]
[ Creature growling, blows landing ]
Jack: [ Grunts ] [ Splat ]
[ Chains jingle ]
You're welcome.
What did you expect, a hug and a kiss?
[ Dramatic music plays ]
By Aku's will, you will die in here.
There is no hope for you, foolish samurai.
Aku is the master of masters and will end you!
[ Electricity crackling ]
No matter what you have planned for me,
I will never buckle, never waiver.
[ Echoing ] Aku has made a world of wonders, and you have soiled it!
Aku is the father of all fathers!
His greatness cannot be measured!
You are a parasite, samurai, feeding off Aku's generosity!
Aku, my master, this fool knows not of your greatness, your kindness, your understanding!
Every thing, every word, every thought that you know is wrong!
He has destroyed mother nature!
Aku has unleashed these monstrosities upon our world, and they feed off his carnage.
Liar!
Believe what you may.
But if you open your eyes and let go of the hate, you will see the truth.
Die.
[ Clinking ]
[ Gasps ]
[ Needles clinking ]
Well, um...
I guess we should get this over with.
You know, uh, many people pay money for this.
It's called acupuncture.
Never mind.
[ Clinking continues ]
[ Low, rhythmic rumbling ]
[ Liquid pattering ]
[ Electricity crackling ]
[ Wind whistles ]
[ Creature chitters ]
Whew.
[ Dramatic music plays ]
[ Clatter ]
I like the back fur.
You look hideous.
From you, "hideous" is quite acceptable.
Thank you.
[ Wind gusts, whistles ]
We're close.
[ Gasps ]
Aaaaaaah!
[ Vine creaking ]
[ Dramatic music plays ]
[ Gasps ]
[ Creatures squeaking ]
Even in the bowels of the darkest of creatures, there is beautiful light.
[ Wind gusts ]

Seems simple enough --
Use the flying creatures to escape and not fall into the pool of acid.
Right.
