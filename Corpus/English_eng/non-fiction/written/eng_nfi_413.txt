Sorry, but I had to do that.
I couldn't let you eat that poor mouse.
Things can't be that bad, can they?

You know, I bought these for my family, but you're welcome to have one.
(CHUCKLES) Glad you liked it.
Well, thanks, I appreciate it.
It's okay.

I'm Charlie.

Tom and Jerry.
(CHUCKLES) Pleased to meet you.
Wow.

It's the most incredible candy anyone can imagine.
And if I keep saving up,
I'll be able to afford a real Wonka bar.
Someday, maybe for my birthday.
Oh, well, who needs a Wonka Bar anyway?
Nice meeting you, Tom and Jerry.
Charlie's late tonight.
He works too hard for a boy his age.
He needs more time to play.
With none of you out of bed in 20 years, it takes a lot to keep us all going.
One day, I'm gonna get out of this bed and help him.
MRS. BUCKET:

Hi, Mom.
Wake up everyone.

Hi, Grandpa George, Grandma Georgina.
Hi, Grandma Josephine.

Cabbage soup?

Well, it's everyone's supper, Charlie.
I'm tired of cabbage water.
Tonight, we're gonna have a real banquet.

(GASPS) Charlie, where did you get this?
I bought it with my salary.

That was very generous of you, Charlie.
Well, I just hope these new friends of yours appreciate it.

And that makes 5,000 boxes of Wonka bars delivered early.
I bet there's a big bonus in that for me.
Now, was that just Wonka bars?
Or were there Scrumdidilyumptious, too?
Huh?

I knows I delivered that box.
(LAUGHS) Must've have left it on the truck.
(DOORKNOB RATTLING)
I don't get it.

(HORN HONKING)
GRANDPA JOE:

But he still keeps putting out the most delicious, the most incredible candy anyone can imagine.
But, Grandpa, why did Mr. Wonka lock himself up in his own factory?
Because of Slugworth.
Slugworth wanted to steal all his recipes, every last one.
Oh, that Slugworth.

And it was on that fateful day that Wonka closed the gates of the factory.
And since then, no one ever comes out.
And no one ever comes in.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
I got it.
Tom?

Where's Jerry?
(SNAPS FINGERS)
Shh!

Grandpa, did you ever see so many?

KID:

- CHARLIE:

- This is for very large warts.

What's going on out there?
Willy Wonka is opening up his factory.
We just heard.

Free chocolate?
But it's only for five people.
He's hidden five golden tickets, and whoever finds them, wins a lifetime supply of chocolate.
Golden tickets, eh?

Inside five Wonka bars.
You gotta buy Wonka bars to find the tickets.
Class dismissed.
(KIDS CHATTERING EXCITEDLY)
(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)
Tom, Jerry, did you hear that?
Boy, if only I had some Wonka bars.
(CHALK SQUEAKING)
Hey, it's a Wonka box.
There must be a hundred Wonka bars in there.
Good work, guys.
We're sure to find a golden... (SIGHS)
Sorry, but those Wonka bars don't belong to us.
REPORTER: (ON TV) It's official.
Wonkamania has descended on the globe.
Hidden among countless billions of Wonka bars are five golden tickets, and the people who find them will win the most fabulous prize anyone could wish for.
Do you think I've got a chance to find one?
One?

No!

Wait, this just in.
The first golden ticket has been found.
We go live to Dusselheim, Germany, to meet the lucky winner, Augustus Gloop.
I'm here with Augustus Gloop, the pride of Dusselheim.
Augustus, how does it make you feel to be the first golden ticket winner?
Hungry.

Mrs. Gloop, you must be so proud.
Of course.
Augustus loves to eat chocolate.
It was only a matter of time before he found
- a golden ticket.

(SIGHS) One down, four to go.
Don't worry, Charlie.
You'll find that golden ticket.
Huh?
VERUCA:

Why haven't they found it yet?
Veruca, angel, they've been working for ten straight days.
Then make 'em work nights!

Sweetheart, there are only four tickets left in the world, and the whole world's searching for them.
Mr. Salt, I've got it!

(GASPS) Give it to me, I want it.
I did it.

I found the golden ticket!
(WHISPERS)
Anxiety runs high as the world enters its 43rd day in the hunt for golden tickets.
But today, the small town of Miles City, Montana, had reason to cheer.
I'm here with the winner of the third golden ticket,
Ms. Violet Beauregarde, who...
Hi, friends, Sam Beauregarde here with all today's great giveaway bargains.
The finest values in the entire country.
Can it, Dad.

Hi, everyone.

MAN:

VIOLET:

I've been chewing this piece for eight solid weeks.
When I heard about this Wonka thing,
I switched to chocolate.
But then, I went straight back to gum.
If I could just jump in here, these deals are going fast, folks.
- (WHISPERS)

That's right, folks, there's only one golden ticket still out there.
'Cause right here in Marble Falls, Arizona, is lucky winner number four.
Mike Teevee.

Quiet.

He won't talk until the commercial break.
Mike loves TV.
I serve all his meals right here.
What about that golden ticket, Mike?
Bang!

Relax, it's just a cap gun.
Isn't he the cutest thing?
(WHISPERS)
- Only one golden ticket left.

You've got as much chance of finding that golden ticket as anyone.
It's okay.

There's one more present for you, Charlie.
A Wonka bar?

I've been saving up.
When I had enough, Tom and Jerry went to the store, so I wouldn't have to get out of bed.
They bought the last Wonka bar in town.
Open her up, Charlie.
Show us that golden ticket.
You open it, Grandpa.

Okay.

You know, I bet those golden tickets make the chocolate taste terrible.
REPORTER:

Local merchants, unable to meet the demand, close early.
The nation's dwindling supply of Wonka bars is held under the tightest security.
It won't be long before finding a Wonka bar is impossible.
Wait!

The fifth and final golden ticket has been found.
The lucky winner is millionaire industrialist
Alberto Minoleta of Paraguay, who had this comment.
I've never been happier.

Turn it off.

Little boy's gotta have some hope in this world.
What hope's he got left now?
We shouldn't tell Charlie tonight.

We're gonna have a feast.
(PEOPLE SHOUTING)
We repeat, the fifth golden ticket is a forgery.
Alberto Minoleta of Paraguay has just been taken into custody by the police.
Ay caramba.
Which means there is still one golden ticket out there.

May I introduce myself?
Arthur Slugworth, president of Slugworth Chocolates Incorporated.
Mr. Wonka is my sworn enemy.
He is currently developing an incredible invention, the everlasting gobstopper.
If he's successful, he'll bankrupt me.
So I need your help.
You must get a hold of an everlasting gobstopper and bring it to me, so I can find the secret formula.
If you do as I say, you'll be rich.
A new house for your family.
Plenty of food and security for the rest of their lives.

You mean you never heard of Oompa Loompas?
Why, they only run Wonka's entire candy operation.
Mr. Wonka brought them here years ago from a strange and dangerous land.
They do the work, and he gives them a nice, safe place to live.
I wanted to be an Oompa Loompa, more than anything.
But I didn't meet the height requirement.
But if I keep trying as hard as I can,
I know I'll be accepted as an Oompa Loompa someday.
Say, what are you guys doing here, anyway?
Wow!

Then he must be on the tour right now!
Slugworth?

Oh, he's up to no good, that's for sure.
We'd better warn Mr. Wonka.
If we go through here, we can catch up with the tour.
I know it looks weird, but it's totally safe.
Trust me, fellas, I know everything about this factory.
Huh.

(TUFFY SCREAMS)
Relax, fellas.

Feast your eyes on the chocolate room.
This is the nerve center of
Willy Wonka's entire operation.
Everything here is edible.
Eatable.

No, you must be imagining things, Charlie.

Come on, guys.
We still have to warn Mr. Wonka about Slugworth.
You will tell Wonka nothing, small mouse.

It seems the three of you have become a danger to my master plan.
And so, you must be taken care of.

Willy Wonka's fabulous invention room.
I know it looks a mess, but this is where Mr. Wonka creates all his amazing inventions.
Including this here sticky-looking wallpaper.
It's sticky as all get-out, but it's pretty tasty.

Mmm.

No, don't, please!
I'm sorry but this is the most top-secret device in my factory.
Old Slugworth would give anything to get his hands on this.
- What's it do?

If you really wanna know.
(BEEPING)
Stretch your tail out, Jerry.
I'll try to pull you free.

What is it?
It's an everlasting gobstopper.
You can suck 'em forever and they'll never get any smaller.
I want an everlasting gobstopper!
- Me too.

But I can only give them to you if you solemnly swear to keep them secret and never show them to anyone for as long as you live.
- Agreed?

Here you go, there's one for everyone.
Wow.
(GRUNTS)
Jerry?
(THUDS)
Ooh, Charlie, look!

- Tom, what happened to you?

Hey, there, I'm Tuffy.
You must be Tom and Jerry's friend, Charlie.
Nice to meet you, Tuffy.
But, what are you three doing here?
We're here to warn Mr. Wonka about his archenemy, Slugworth.
Tom and Jerry saw him sneak into the factory.
Slugworth again!
We'd better tell Mr. Wonka.
(GASPS)
My wall!

Is this cat fur?
Now the factory will have to be triple-sanitized.
Whoever's responsible will be permanently banished from the premises forever.
Permanently!
Oh, that's not cat fur, Mr. Wonka.
Some of my mustache came off when I was licking this wall.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
(GRUNTING)
(SNEEZES)
My mistake.

Now, if you'll follow me,
I have something very special to show you.
It's a three-course dinner.
Hey, check it out.

Oh, Violet, please give it back.
That's dinner-gum and it's not ready for human consumption.
You heard Mr. Wonka, honey.
Zip it, Dad, it's gum.

Mmm.
Stop.

Mmm.

It's like a full-course dinner.
I can actually taste it.
Tomato soup and roast beef.
It's delicious!
We have to warn Mr. Wonka about Slugworth, Grandpa.
But if Wonka finds out about Tom, he'll throw us all out.
You'll lose the lifetime supply of chocolate.
Mmm.

And wait...

Here comes the dessert.
Blueberry pie!

Hey, what's going on?

You're turning violet, Violet!
What are you talking about?
Her face!

I know, she's turning into a blueberry.
It always happens when you reach the dessert.
Oh, well.

I feel funny. (GASPS)

I got a blueberry for a daughter.
Well, well, well.
Two naughty, nasty little children gone.
Three good, sweet little children left.
Shall we move on?
You're going to love this next invention.
What's it doing, Mr. Wonka?
It's making fizzy lifting drinks.
The drink fills you with gas and the gas lifts you right off the ground like a balloon.
Wow.

I want a fizzy lifting drink.
No, no, sorry.

There'd be children flying around everywhere.
Now, come along.
All this excitement's made me thirsty.
Let's take a drink.

Come on, one small drink won't hurt us.
CHARLIE:

Ah.
Mmm.

I don't feel any different.
Me neither.
Frankly, I'm a little dissapoin... (YELLING)
I...

Hey!

Oh.

Whee!
(YAWNS)
- (CLICKS) - (BUZZING)
(BEEPING)
Tom!

(GRUNTS)
Oh, fudge!

(CRASHING)
(MACHINES POWERING DOWN)
(GASPS) An everlasting gobstopper.
If Slugworth gets his hands on it,
Mr. Wonka will be ruined.
We'd better hide this thing.
You three will hide nothing.
You have interfered with my master plan for the last time.
You tell him, boss.
Give me that gobstopper!
Hang on to that gobstopper, Tom!
SPIKE:

(GROANING)
Uh-oh!

Ha!

This is amazing.
I'm a jet plane.
I'm a rocket ship!
I'm...

Hey, Grandpa!

Charlie, look out!
We'll get cut to ribbons!
- Help!

Cough up the gobstopper.
Hang on, Tom!

(SPIKE GROANING)
Dinner gum.

Mmm.

Oh.

(GRUNTS) What?

- Sorry, coming through.

Run, fellas!
We can't let Slugworth get that gobstopper.
Oh, I'm really regretting some life choices here.
(GRUNTS) You purple, bloated imbecile!
(GROANING)
CHARLIE:

GRANDPA JOE:

GRANDPA JOE:

Help!
- Help us!

We gotta get them to burp before they're chopped up by that fan.
(GROANING)
GRANDPA JOE:

CHARLIE:

BOTH:

CHARLIE:

Anyone, if you can hear us...
(BURPS)
- I'm going down.

Burp, Charlie, you gotta burp.
(GRUNTING)
(BURPS)
I'm going down, too.
(BURPS)
(BOTH BURPING)
(SIGHS) That was a close one.

CHARLIE:

Come on, fellas, we gotta get that gobstopper to a safe place.
The safest place for that gobstopper is in my hand.
No!

TUFFY:

Stop!

Quick, drink this!
Thanks, but I'm more of a lemonade guy.
(GRUNTS) Again with the eyes!
Watch out for those peppermint spikes, Spike.
(LAUGHING)
(GASPS)
(SCREAMING)
(LOUD THUD)
We're miles below the factory in Mr. Wonka's rock candy mines.
Slugworth will never find us or that gobstopper down here.
MR. SLUGWORTH:

Unfortunately for you,
I happen to be an accomplished spelunker.
Into the mine car, guys!
MR. SLUGWORTH:

Geese, laying golden eggs.
Chocolate golden eggs, and only the finest.
As you can see, these are quadruple-sized geese and they lay octuple-sized eggs.
(HONKING)
WONKA:

The good ones are kept and polished up.
The bad eggs are dropped down the chute.
(SCREAMING)
(TOM GRUNTING)
(SCREAMING)
Daddy, I want you to buy me a golden goose.
Uh... (STAMMERS)
I want you to buy me one of those golden geese!
Whatever you say, honey.
How much for the golden goose, Wonka?
Out of the question.

I want my golden goose.
And if I don't get it,
I'm going to scream!

She was a bad egg.
So, where'd it send her?
Where it sends all the other bad eggs.
Down the garbage chute.
(LAUGHING) The garbage chute.
Which, of course, leads to the furnace.
The furnace?
(LAUGHING) She'll be broiled like a bratwurst.
Maybe she's just stuck inside the tube.
(LAUGHS) Inside the...

Hang on!

(MR. SALT SCREAMING)
Fortunately, that furnace is only lit on Tuesdays.

Out of my way, cat!
(BOTH SCREAM)
I want you to take me home and buy me my own chocolate factory, Daddy.
- No.

You're going to learn some discipline
- when we get home, Miss Salt.

(FURNACE DOOR OPENS)
Wonkavision, my latest and greatest invention.
So, it's just television?
Uh, it's Wonkavision.

Lights, camera, Wonkavision!
(GASPS)
What happened to the chocolate?
It's flying over our heads in a zillion pieces and it gets reassembled over there.
Of course, the chocolate gets smaller when we beam it through.

I bet old Slugworth would pay a fortune
- to find out about this.

- It's delicious.

It's Wonkavision.
Can you send people through this thing?
People?

I suppose I could.
Yes, yes, I'm sure I could.

Check it out, Mom,
I'm going to be the first person to be sent by television.
Mike, get away from there!
Oh, I wouldn't do that.
Lights, camera, action!
Sweetie, no!
Where is he?
He's flying over our heads in a zillion pieces.
Look everybody, I'm on TV.
Wait till everybody back home sees this.
No one's gonna see anything.
Hey, Mom, what are you doing?
Stop!
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)
Take the boy down to the taffy pulling room.
We should have him stretched back to normal in no time.

Mr. Wonka, what's gonna happen to them?
Mike?

Augustus?

My dear boy, I promise you they'll be all right.
They'll all soon be restored to their normal, dreadful old selves.
What's next, Mr. Wonka?
Oh, well, uh, this concludes the tour.
I hope you enjoyed it.
You can show yourselves out.

I'm terribly busy.

Thank you.

- Did we do something wrong?

Charlie.

Tom.

Bad news, guys.
Slugworth's got the gobstopper.
Oh, no!

Mr. Wonka will be ruined.
We can't let him get away.
Don't worry.
I think I can track him with these TV monitors.
CHARLIE:

I don't see him.
There he is.

They're leaving the factory.
Not if I can grab him with this Wonkavision remote.
(REMOTE BEEPING)
GRANDPA JOE:

- (SCREAMS)

We've been Wonkavisioned.
We got you right where we want you, Slugworth.
Now, hand over that tiny gobstopper!
(LAUGHING)
(SCREAMS)
Oh, my heaven.
I'm a big boy now.
Tom, you reversed the signal!
(MACHINE BEEPING)
Now you will pay the price for interfering with my master plan.
Tom, press more buttons.

- A-ha!

Gotcha.
(MACHINE BEEPING)
I have you now, cat.
My offer still stands, Charlie Bucket.
With two gobstoppers,
I could rule the candy world.
Join me.
Hey, what the...
Charlie, pass me the remote.
- (MACHINE BEEPING)

No!

My gobstopper!
I've beamed it into a million pieces.
You'll never get it back.
You'll pay for this, mouse.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
- (MR. SLUGWORTH GASPS) - (GRUNTING)
(GRUNTING)
SPIKE:

No!

Charlie, dear boy, how perfect.
Now you and I can be partners.
Our gobstopper will make us kings of the candy world.
It will make your family rich.
Let me have that remote, son.
You won't need it anymore.
Charlie!
(CHUCKLES)
- (REMOTE BEEPS) - (BOTH GASPING)
TUFFY:

It'll take a while before they could put themselves back together again.
Hey, look, the camera added four inches.
I bet I meet the Oompa Loompa height requirement now.
Well, good riddance to Slugworth, I say.
Come on, Charlie, we got some business to attend to.
Excuse me, Mr. Wonka?
WONKA:

Um, but what about Charlie's lifetime supply of chocolate?
- When does he get it?

What?

WONKA:

What factory rules?
We didn't see any rules.
Wrong, sir, wrong.
Under section 37 of the contract signed by him, all offers shall become null and void, etc., etc., etc...
You stole fizzy lifting drinks.
And to make matters worse, you allowed a cat into my factory.
A cat and his two filthy mice friends.
Now the entire factory will have to be sterilised.
So you get nothing!
You lose!

You're a cheat.
How can you build up a little boy's hopes and then disappoint him like this.
I said, "Good day."
Come on, Charlie, you've still got your gobstopper.
Once we find a way to bring back Slugworth, he'll pay big money for it.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
WONKA:

Charlie?
My boy, you did it.
You won the contest.

Oh, Charlie, forgive me for putting you and your friends through this.
Forgive me, please, forgive me.
Charlie, let me introduce Mr. Wilkinson.
Pleasure to meet you, Charlie.
- Slugworth.

He's one of my workers.

But you said you had a master plan against Mr. Wonka.
(LAUGHS) No, my boy.
My master plan was to help Wonka find an heir.
I was concerned that you and Tom and Jerry would interfere with that plan.
So, I had to try and stop you.
Who knew?
Oh, Charlie, I had to test you, and you passed with flying colors.
This is all so exciting.
But we have to get going.
So much time and so little to do.
Strike that.

We'll take the Wonkavator.
If you please, Charlie.

Oh, Tuffy.
It looks like you've grown a lot.
Come on in...
- Oompa Loompa.

♪ Oompa Loompa doompadee doo ♪
Huh!

No hard feelings.
Wait, I was only doing my job.
You know, I never liked that guy.
- How am I going to get home now?

Don't put me on the drawer.
MR. SLUGWORTH:

The Great Glass Wonkavator.
(GASPS) These buttons can take us anywhere in the factory.
Yes, and I've pressed them all, all except for one.
Go on, Charlie.

(ALL EXCLAIMING)
CHARLIE:

(BOTH GULPING)
So, Charlie, how did you like my factory?
Mr. Wonka, it's the most wonderful place in the whole wide world.
I'm happy to hear you say that.
- Because I'm giving it to you.

You're giving your factory to Charlie?
Absolutely.
You can move in immediately.
You and your entire family.

Wow, I still can't believe this is happening.
You know what happened to the boy who suddenly got everything he ever wanted?
What?
He lived happily ever after.
