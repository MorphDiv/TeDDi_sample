[device beeps]
What are you worried about, hon?
He's not okay.
I wanna go and see him.
Look, I know he's in Milwaukee.
I could be three in three hours.
And how do you know this?
It's just...

You brought it.
Hmm.
There's a woman in Europe.
She's investigating this thing... this incident that John's connected to.
She's gotten footing.
Nothing meaningful, but footing.
And, Alice, she cannot connect the person that John's positioned as right now to John Tavner.
And she cannot connect him to you.
It means his freedom.
Something happened, and it means his freedom.
He called you, I know, from this place on this night.
You've already broken the rules.
No, I didn't, Tom.
But John did.
For the first time.
[sighs]
We have this principle we use when we're trying to locate someone who doesn't want to be discovered.
You are what you can't stop doing.
What that means...
If we discover what someone is passionate about, then that person and that thing will intersect.
Passion involves compulsion.
And people...

People and what they love don't always intersect.
People and their compulsions do.
And John, well, he's compelled toward you.
He's crazy about you.
And if this woman learns that and follows you to your impending point of intersection, well, then that's the end of all of it, honey.
So, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you two to intersect.
[soft sigh]
I wanna look out for him.
Because...
Why?
Because I don't think anyone's looking out for him, Dad.
I am.
Oh...
I'll go to him now.
Okay, hon?
I'll go right now.
- Don't let go.

- Are you holding on?

- Dad?

[crash]
[indistinct PA ananouncement]
It's one man.
- And you say that he...

- With your attaché materials?

- Which are?

- Of?

- Which?

I don't know that I'm allowed to say.
- You are.

Uh, Madagascar.
Um, El Dorado.
That's a city of lore.
- What?

Yeah.

I...

I had so many maps in there...
Anyway, it was akin to...
Do you have purse snatchings here?
- Seldom.

Well, it was like that.
Akin to.
They just ran by, snatched my bag.
That was that.
- Did you fight?

I fought like hell.
I asked to interview you because your attack happened in the radius of a murder on the same evening of the murder within the same hour.
Wow.
I'm afraid I told you everything I can about that evening.
[Woman speaking French on P.A.]
I can't believe all that money fit in this pillow.
I may have seemed a little nervous back there at TSA.
It's cool.
I just want you to know that fainting isn't a sign of weakness.
It's just a sign that your bod doesn't have the support system to cross the finish line.
Okay.
Thanks.
You have more than piping on your mind.
Stressed?
So?
Can I show you something?
Something that helps me?
Let me see your Blackberry.
The day planning feature.

What's the most important thing you have to accomplish today?
Do you remember there was a sum of money?
I handed it off, and we can't find the guy now.
So... what?
So I have to find him... before he uses the money to...
I need to find him today.
Okay, what's the second most important thing?
Probably Leslie's fuckin' plate thing.

The conference is at the Westphalia Odeon.
It's...

It's...

Great.
Fuck.
Hey, let's tackle it.
What's the first task today?
- First task up?

Well, I have to capture a guy.
Tape him up.

Then put him in this bag.
How long does that take typically?
[whispers] Taping a man?
I don't know.

Probably a lot.
It's probably hard.
You wanna put, like... four minutes?
Uh, whatever.
Well, I mean, it's not whatever.
John, we're making a schedule.
I'm just gonna put four minutes.
Hey, don't put "capture a guy."
Well, what should I put?
I don't know.
- Put "CG."

Good code.
For your ringtone, I'm just gonna pick a random reminder from my cloud, okay?
What do you have for the rest of the day?
- A lot.

Yeah, that's why we're doing this, so you can do a lot.

Can we couple them?
Hell, yeah, we can.
Want to know how?
Get this.
Proprietary to McMillan.
Only us.

We fit Donnely nut spacing grip grids and splay-flexed brace columns against beam-fastened derrick husk nuts and girdle plate Jerries, while plate flex tandems press task apparati of 10 vertpin-plated pan traps at every maiden clamp plate packet.
Knuckle couplers plate alternating sprams from the T-Nut to the S.K.N to the chim line.

You know what?
I mean...
What?
I've just been wondering in this moment after you said that why so many safes fall out of windows in cartoons.
Why the fuck are safes falling out of windows so much?
Maybe the basis for that is that that's how people would get them open.
That could be the basis for that.
Yeah.

Maybe people were trying to open them that way.
That forms the basis for the cartoons.
Which, you know, the best ones, they always reflect real life.
Yeah, true.
