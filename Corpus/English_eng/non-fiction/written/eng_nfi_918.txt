What time is it?
I don't know. 10:17?
Are you all right?
Tired.

I have an incredible headache.

- Did I drink last night?

Yeah, you drank.
At... at that bar?
At the bar, here...
Here?
Did something hap...

I don't wanna talk about it.
What...
Hi, boys!

I gotta pick up the twins from my mother's and drop them off at daycare because I got the lunch shift today.
Hope that things work out for you soon,
- honeybunch.

Alright, I'll see ya when I see ya.

Bye.

Yeah, I don't wanna talk about it.
*MICHAEL EVERY DAY* Season 02 Episode 06 "Hodophobia Part 2" Synchronized by srjanapala
you're an alcoholic.
Yesterday was an unusual day.

I had one beer.

And then you drank the champagne before you tried to poison a moose.
That was to make room for the pills.

I mean, you really drank there.

- it was stress-induced drinking...

It was something you said to the stripper
- that really sealed it.

- At the hotel, at 4:28.

You said "I'm an alcoholic."
Did I have sex with the stripper?
There was more crying than sex.
- I made her cry?

Oh God!
Look...
- I don't know what I said last night...

In Vino Veritas.
Is not accurate, is what I'm saying.

Ok.
Maybe there was some truth in there, but...
You know what?

It's really important for me not to know anything about you.

I need to think of you as superman.

Yes.
I'm erasing the events of last night from my mind.

- Oh, they're barely there.

So last night never happened.
Hey, boys!

What can I get yous?

I'm not gonna be your enabler.
The meatloaf's good.
Oh!
Hey, hi!
I got here as fast as I could.
I drove like a teenager on coke, but I'm here for you, just like you are for me.
- Great.

That we were stranded and where we are.
- Dr. storper.

- We talked for an hour.

Ah!

- He was really drunk.

I'm an idiot.
- Meredith was right about you

- About me, about the whole thing.

It doesn't matter that I don't remember the specifics of what I said, because I was drunk when I said them and, you know...
- In Vino Veritas.

I mean, we know Vino Veritas is Latin for a reason.
It's just that you said some really beautiful things.
- You did.

I meant those things that I said, every word.
Yeah, ok.

You need to get your stuff.

You're gonna drive us?
- You asked me to.

Right.

- I gotta get a new suit...

- Really?

Great.
Thank you for coming.

Um.

David, they weren't actually damaged.

You told me that last night.

Ok, the important thing to remember is this.
In that nightmare yesterday, you were the only person I called.
I'm looking for a man, answers to the name of Dashiell.
Middle-aged, tall, pale, sickly, ambiguous sexuality, seriously anxious, probably consuming enormous amounts of alcohol while he's trying to comfort another man who's likely crying.
Oh, and they're both covered with blood.
Have you seen him?
- Is this ok here?

Yeah.
Ow.

I can still see it, just here.
- You look good.

- It's gonna go well.

When it's done,
- do you think you're gonna fly home or...

Look, you don't have a fear of flying.

Maybe you're not afraid of flying, you're afraid of going away.
- What do you mean?

Ok.
Seniors...
How can we get them to use the Internet?
In the past, we have simplified it, restricted access, dumbed it down.
But I think that's the wrong approach.

I think they're afraid of it.
Watch this video, please.
My name's Al Jordan.
I'm 82 years old.
- Do you ever use the Internet?

We created a mock form that's really a search engine.

- The form has changed.

Now I'm looking outside those,
- put in Saskatchewan.

So I'm gonna leave you for about three hours
Wait, wait.

- You cannot break the Internet.

He was scared at first, a little panicky.

- So, what did you think?

- but it took me places.

- When will you come to Halifax?

You need a bigger team.

- serves 81,000 seniors.

This is your whole life now, you realize that?

Mr. Renn, what are you doing here?
I came to see your presentation, of course.

- It's wonderful to see you, Mr. Renn.

You had such poise up there.

I was worried about you.

But look at this!

I wish you good luck, Michael, and hope you visit us soon.
- I will.

Boy, you really knocked it out of the park in there.
I quit.
Seriously?
- Oh!

Can you give me a ride to the airport?
Sure.
- You quit?

I didn't get what you meant at first, about me being afraid of something else, but I get it now and I know what it is.
Did you plan all this?

Well, there was a certain amount of planning
No, it was instinct.

- He's like a brain detective.

I don't wanna say it till I know I'm right.
I guess this is the end.
Of?

You literally drove me there.
Well, therapy's never really over, remember?
Well, not for me, maybe, but...

Yeah, there's some things I'm gonna look into.
Rehab?
Yeah.

I'd get an sti test too, if I were you.
Oh...

- Yeah.

- For so many things.

- Safe flight.

What is it about him, this particular patient?
I don't know, might have something to do with the fact that you slept with his mother.
In Vino Veritas, David.
Oh, that's my phone.
Oh.
Hello?
David Storper, yes.
Thank you.
Can we stop in North Bay?
- North Bay?

Goddamn
Farmersville.

Why are you...
- So sorry.

Oh, it's you.
All of the research I could've been doing while chasing this Will-o'- the-Wisp Psychiatrist.
- So, you hit someone?

I struck him across his fat face.
- It was fatter than mine.

He had a leg tremor and Nystagmus.
- That's abnormal eye movements.

I told him as much.
That's a neurological disease.

- She knows what it is!

Well, you should, seeing the company you keep.
I-I still don't understand why you hit him.
He called me a nosy old Jew.
Jew, yes.

Ok, well, uh, good for you.
- What is that?

He should be in the air by now, if he got on the plane.
Makes you wanna dance, doesn't it?
I am so sorry.
I feel like I've been in this car for four years.

I've got lumbar osteophyte that's digging into my liver.

- Ok, enough with the talking.

Dr. Dismal?

That's why I'm here.
No, you're here because you have self-esteem issues, so it's comforting for you to be with someone who's so massively dysfunctional.

Look, I'm grateful that you came to rescue me.
May I suggest that you write down the name of the town next time?
Yeah, there's not gonna be a next time.
So, of course...

Donald is a mess.

He's an anal retentive depressive with narcissistic personality disorder manifested by a gross appetite for drugs and alcohol, which he consumes in gargantuan amounts.
But he loves you.
You two are connected.
That's why he called you from the motel.
You know, every therapist has a patient whom he thinks about long after the session is over, and that patient helps him as much as he is helped by the therapist.
For him, it's this Michael man.
For me, it's Dimitri.
He meant to say David.

No, Dimitri!
The great boy I've been treating for PTSD.
He was in Afghanistan.
He's a hero.

Ok, we can just drop him off anywhere along here.
Sir, I would suggest that you get help before you fly again.
Oh, I'll never be doing that
- again.

Thanks for all your help.
- I did it!

Are you up?
No, I'm here.

- Thank you.

Yeah, yeah.

It's better than it was before.

- Ok.

Well, goodbye.

- I lost the apartment.

I don't think I'm capable of taking care of myself right now.
I need help.

David, I think that you should sleep in my basement.
Ok?

Tomorrow?

Can you drop me at the office?

Because that's where you're sleeping?
Yeah.
And I've got some business that I have to take care of in the morning.
You know, he's right.

About you and I, this connection.
Yeah.
Hi.

-It's like 12:30.

- I don't have a fear of flying.

He thought it was a symptom, but not the cause.

- Ok?

I have a fear of losing you.

See, the flying triggered a panic reaction because it was taking me away from you.
The real life stuff has been taking me away from you.
We talked about this.

I wanna be with you and Sophie.

I wanna live here, marry you even, if you're into that.
Whoa, slow down.

This is unfair, Michael.

- and I swear I can help with that.

- I've been handling things.

I don't want you to have to take care of me anymore.
I wanna help take care of you.

- you can kick me out.

Ok, that's a bad choice of words and I'm sorry.
But... child care, yeah.
And cooking, maybe.
And then...
Maybe we could see what happens.
One step at a time.
Thank you.
You start early.
I'm a professional.
What I mean by that is I start work early, but I also go home at 5 pm.
I dreamt I fired you last night.

You'd know that if you transcribed my dictation.
In these dreams, would I be a projection of some aspect of your personality?
Your professionalism, maybe?

I'm not a doctor, but...

Good morning.

Um, can we talk for a moment?
A couple of things.

Sammy and I are a couple again, despite your best efforts.
It was an eeriksonian intervention.

An eriksonian intervention.

Well, I haven't been at the top of my game lately, which brings me to my second point.
I'd like to offer you my practice.
It seems like a reasonable way of deferring some of the costs of our failed partnership.
I'm taking an indefinite leave of absence.
Ok.

My own problems for a while.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I actually believe that you're a good doctor.
Well, you know, I think you might be a little better than me, which is why I'm trusting you with my patients.
So, Beth has all the files.

There's one patient who's particularly important to me.
Michael.
He's going through a transitional phase right now.
You take very good care of him, please.
I will.
Good luck, David.
The therapeutic process never ends.

Ah!
One is never cured.
Someone can spend too much time and mental effort identifying and treating the problems in their life.
The folly in that is that there's no time left for living.
No, that's...
Sometimes I think I have it all wrong.
Sometimes I think that those things that I perceive as problems in my life are actually the component parts of my life itself.
It's the lens through which I see my life that's broken.
Huh.
