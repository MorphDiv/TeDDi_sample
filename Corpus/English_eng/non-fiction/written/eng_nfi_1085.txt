...because smiling is attractive.
Ok, smiling, you know, it draws people in.
It's more likely to draw people in than to push them away.

Have you ever wondered?
Kids smile 400 times a day, adults 20.
So, thinking about it, you should smile at least once an hour.
At least!
He was stationed in Afghanistan and a civilian village came under attack.
My dad spotted a woman cowering with her baby, and, without thinking, he just ran forward to save them but he didn't see the landmine.
How was work?

Mrs. Anderson got a new hip.
Katie still tossing over Mr. Williams but Mr. Franklin's still hangging in there.
He was a boxer when he was young.
I didn't know that.
He's got a bit of fight left in him.
Did you sleep alright?
Like a baby.
What would I do without you?
Probably starve and die.
Ok, I gotta go!
My mains are waiting for me.
Mom.
Bye.
Get off him!
What's it to you?

What are you doing?
It's not worth it.
And who you are you, his boyfriend?
You were the one enjoying sitting' on top of him.
Get off of him.
Freak!
Do you think she's dying?
We're all dying.
She had a fall and broke her hip, that's all.
Are we really going to stay here?
I thought you never got along with her.
Look, she's in trouble and she needs our help
It's a good option, Chrissy!
You mean it's the only option, dad.
Hi, Jenny, I'm Philip.

It's good to finally meet you Nice to meet you.
Can I get you anything?

Just before we start, I should say I haven't made up my mind yet.
Ok.
Shall I just talk you through how it works?
You'll go in first and you'll read...
Wait, he's going to be there, right?
He's requested to there be, yeah.
I can't, I can't be in the same room with him.
Ah, well, you can petition that he isn't in the room, if you're going to find it too distressing but he can appeal.
They're going to let him out, aren't they?
I don't know.
They do take everything into account:
his psychiatric evaluation, his behavior in prison, your victim statement
So, you think that could sway the board?
Yes, it could.
In person, that's powerful.
I've seen it happen before.
My son is still a child.
I cannot let that man anywhere near him.
Hi!

Thanks for this morning.

I haven't see you on the bus before.
My dad usually drives me in but he's away on business.
What kind of business?

He builds drills.

What about yours?
He died.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It was a long time ago.
He was stationed in Afghanistan.
A civilian village came under attack.
My dad spotted a woman, cowering with her baby.
Without thinking, he ran forward to save her but he didn't see the landmine.
He sounds like a brave man.
Yeah, he was.
Were you scared?
On the bus?
A bit.
Actually, I was terrified.
Everything went black, then it went white.
Then I heard your voice.
I can't do it!
Yes, you can.
No, I really can't.
What are you scared of?
Everything.
Come, come with me.
I need you to believeing yourself.
Oscar!
Help me!
Sam?
Sam?
Look!

I thought you were dead.
You...
What?
Bastard!
Fuck!
What are you doing?
Making it nice for when she gets home.
Do you want to give me a hand?
Was she mad?

I'm sure she'll be pleased in the long run.
Can't find anything in here.
Gimme!
Old habits die hard.
When are we going to go and see my gram?
I think I should go on my own first.
Why?
Well, I need to see how she is.
I thought you said she'd only broken her hip.
I haven't seen her in a long time, Chrissy!
Alright?

Calm down, dad I am calm!
Look, we don't know Alec, either.
Come on, let's get cracking.
Hi, Pop!

Oh, Sam.
Take a look in the drawer.
There?
Look, the tin!
You take them.
You sure?

Get out of the way, sonny.

Mr. Franklin needs his rest.

Good night, Pop.
Be...

I'm like a flaming octopus, here.
What did the boy octopus say to the girl?
I'll hold your hand...
Hand, hand, hand, hand
Give us one of those, son.
Got only empties.
There!

Excuse me, are you using this?

Jim just found Israel with a knife.
He, for his part, took a great draft of the wine and spoke with most unusual solemnity.
For thirty years, he said,
I've sailed the seas and seen good and bad, better and worse, fair weather and foul, provisions running out, mouths going and whatnot.
Well, now, I tell you...
I never seen good come of goodness yet.
Him that strikes first is my fancy.
Dead men don't buy wine.
Them's my views.

And now, you look here, dear.

Good luck!
Fill the flask and mix the solutions and place it on a piece of paper marked with a cross
Number 4:

Can I help you?
Are you Mr. Wilkinson?

I'm Chrissy, Chrissy Anderson.
You're late!
I was in the wrong lab.

Right.

Can you let your mother know, your clothes need ironing in this school.
Okay, so you call that...
Hello, Mum!
What are you doing here?
I've come to look after you.
What about work?
I managed to juggle a few things.
I wanted to get the house ready for you coming home.
Bought you these.
Shouldn't have.
You've aged.
You're not looking so great yourself.
This your son?

Nice to meet you.

Bill.

He's come all the way from Nottingham to look after me.
He's a Detective Inspector, you know.
Ah, you must be very proud.
I get us a tea.
Yeah.
Tonk!
Did I frighten you?
No
I'm Sam
Do you want me to guess your's?

What did it feel like this morning, when everyone was looking at you?
What's it to you?

Where are you from?

What does anybody want?
True love, marriage, some kids, nice car.
You know, kids; they smile 400 times a day, adults, 20.

Best, 25.

Makes you live longer and it's an attractive expression.
More likely to draw people to you than to push them away.
It's called facial feedback hypothesis
Really?

There's the "eager to please smile",
"the lopsided smile",
Funny how none of them meet your eyes.
You're trying too hard.
Really?
I've got a great bullshit protector.
No, you're doing really well.
It's not easy when you've got the monitor on.
There we go.

Oh, Sam,
I need to talk to you about something.
What's up?
Mr. Franklin died.
It was his heart in the end?
Yeah.

That's right.
Shame.
I'm sorry, Sam.

Me, too.
Is it ok if I... go say my goodbyes?
What were you doing?

I saw you.

I was just brushing his hair.

You can't do that!
You can not be in here What's going on?
I was just saying my goodbyes, Mum.

You should go, son.

He's not doing any harm.
He's 16!

Well, he wants to be a doctor.
He reads to the patients.

Why isn't he with his friends?
I don't think it's healthy
I was at the swimming pool last night.
I thought we were going to meet.

You must have gone alone.

You must have!
Do you want one?
Do you want to come to mine tomorrow night?
It's my dad's birthday.
There'll be lots of food and bad dancing and stuff.
Maybe.
Whoever did this, I advise you to step forward now
Imagine if you've done it.
Must make him feel sick.
Why?
Don't bother me.
Do you know her?

I guarantee, I will find you.
It was me.
Sam Woodford, my office!
It wasn't him, it was me.
Shit!

He's got a parole hearing.
He's coming to the end of his term What?

They asked me if I want to make a victim's statement.
Will that make a difference?
I don't know.
I don't know what to do.
Partly, I want them to listen, to know exactly what kind of man he is
and the other part... the other part is shit-scared.
Hello?
It was probably just a prank but
I really should suspend them.
He's never done anything like this before
He's doing really well.
He's on the diving team and the swimming team.
This is totally out of character for him.
His marks are fine.
I don't seem to have any contact details for his dad.
His dad's dead.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
How do you think he's getting on, otherwise?
What do you mean?

That's not right!

Look,
I'm going to keep him on a rolling detention, for now.
but let's make sure this is a one-off.
It will be.

Right.

Don't ever fight my battles for me again!
I thought you'd be pleased, just trying to help
Helping sounds like it's for the people but really, it's a selfish act.
What do you mean?
If you think about most human interactions,
People only give to receive.
Well, what if I said I liked you?
That's not giving to receive.
Yes, it is, because at some point, you expect me to say that I like you back.
It's just a nice thing to say.
It's what people do.
I don't give a shit what people do.
Oh, well, I do like you.
Can I see you later?
What's going on, Sam?
've only just stopped you from being suspended.
It wasn't me.
It was a new girl at school
What new girl?

I didn't want her taking the blame.
Is there something going on between you?
No, just...
I didn't want her to get into trouble.
Oh, my God, it's you!

This is gonna sound terrible!
My daughter set fire to the science lab and I think your son tried to shoulder the blame.
Yeah.
I'm really sorry.
Well, thanks for apologizing.
She just started a new school and this is how she introduces herself.
She's been a bit of a handful since her mum died.
Well, that must be really hard for both of you.
Doesn't turn out the way you imagine when you're young, does it?
Well, none of us thought we would be doing it on our own.
Thanks for stopping by.
Would I be able to buy you a coffee, sometime?
I could even stretch to a custard tart... or a carrot cake?

Sorry, I didn't mean to put you on the spot!
Well, I'll see you, anyway, at the hospital
Yes, yeah.
Bye.
I'm sorry, Mum.
I really am.
there's something I wanted to ask you.
Have you got friends at school?
What are you talking about?
What did the ed say?
She said you didn't form close friendships.
What would she know, she barely knows who I am.
Oh, I don't know, she asked your Form teacher, then.
He thinks there's something wrong with everyone.
Of course, I've got friends!
You didn't believe it, did you?
Well, I don't know what to believe
Is there something worrying you?
No.
No, I'm fine.
You sure?
You haven't been yourself lately
Yeah, I have!

Can I have a hug?
My dad was in the army, you see, and he spotted this woman, cowering with her baby.
Without even thinking, he just ran forward to save them, but he got shot in the head
He got caught in a crossfire,
but he didn't spot the landmine.
Without even thinking, he just ran forward to save them, but he got sh... but he didn't spot the landmine.
He didn't spot the landmine.
Hi, I'm Sam.

Oscar's a lovely boy!
Nah.
Mum!
Can you knock?

I need a help with my dress, this zipper's really tight.
Fine, turn around.
Are you going out?
You going out with Chrissy?
No, I'm not going out with her.
With friends, then?
Stop quizzing me.

Alright!
You smell nice.
Mum!
Are you gonna let me get changed?
My mum did it when I was nine.
That's terrible.
No, it's not!
I like it.
Do you want to go?
You go first.
It's all "Barbarian burners" for 60%.
I'm an emperor now.
Hi!

You must be Sam.
Pleased to meet you.

He's told me all about you.
All good things, though!

Oscar's been telling me how you've been teaching him to dive.
It's a pleasure, he's doing well.
You two, coming downstairs?
We've got enough to feed a small army here.
In a minute, I'm just finishing this Level up.
We'll be down.
Oscar, come on.
Ah, shit!
Let me do it.
Well, how old is your dad?

Well, why don't you know?

Sorry you got stuck talking to him.
He can really bore on, sometimes.
No, he's great.
Try having him as your dad.
Hey, how's it going?
Oh, that looks good!
Watch your fingers!
Okay, not too heavy?

Right.

You're missing the party!

I've come to get some plates.

You're very polite!
Now, come on.

What?
Have you made a decision yet?
Yeah, but... the worst thing is that Sam doesn't know.
I think you should keep it that way.
But even if Peter does get out, which I don't think he will, he doesn't know where you live
He's not going to find you.
But you never have to tell Sam.
All good, boys?
When's your next match?
Next weekend.
Is it football?

Oscar, here, stands undefeated
Junior League, under-16's chess champion for the last 3 consecutive years.

What?
Never missed a match, have we?
Follows in his father's footsteps
Sam dives, he's really good.
Yeah, I know.
I bet your dad's really proud of you.
My dad passed away.
I'm really sorry
He was...
He was stationed in Afghanistan.
A civilian village came under attack.
My dad spotted a woman cowering with her baby, without thinking, he ran forward to save them but he was shot in the head.
I thought you said it was a landmine.
Yeah, it was a landmine.
Yeah, but you just said...

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Do you want a blow by blow account of how my father died?
Do you?

I'm sure that he was...
No, no.

Thanks for the party.
Sam, I got fish and chips!
Sam!
Sam?
It's late.
I know, I just came to read to you.
Okay, Sam.
As he was thus speaking, he had risen from bed with almost...
Sam!
Has something happened?
Where have you been?
Party.
I should like to be your age, again.
Met my wife at a dance.
I'll bet the girls love you, eh?
There's no one.
I can't believe that.
Good looking boy like you?
What's her name, Sam?
I told you, there's no one.
Is she the reason for the long face, son?
Don't call me that!
Sam?
Sam, what are you doing?
Is there something wrong with my machine?
Listen, Sam, I really don't think you should... wait for me...
Stop!
Shh!
Shh, shut up...
Excuse it...
That's better...
Sam!
I was just gettin' my book.
I just wanted to say I'd... been really sorry about the other day.
It won't happen again.
Ok.
Good night, Kathy.

Sam, what are you doing?
Just showing mum how Mr. Williams died.
I need to speak to Sam.

Well, he was here last night, wandering around, as usual.
I've done something terrible!
I told Sam his dad was dead.
and he's not.
Aye, Sir...
