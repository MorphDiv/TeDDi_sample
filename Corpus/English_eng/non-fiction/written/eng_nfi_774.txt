My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.
I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats, and I am the only one fast enough to stop them.
I am The Flash.
Previously on "The Flash"...
I stabbed your mother in the heart
Eddie is his ancestor.
If Eddie dies, he'll never be born.
He's being erased from existence.
I'm leaving Central City.
Joe, you have a son.
Don't let him take me back there.
I would do anything to get you back.
[bone snaps]
There are many reasons why we run, but usually it's to avoid what's right in front of us...
A decision to be made or a dilemma we have to face.
Lately, for me, it feels like running is all I've been doing.
What you got for me, Cisco?
You've been playing Good Samaritan all morning.
Take a break.
Are you sure you don't want to get to CCPD,
'Cause we cannot afford to waste any more time.
What, 'cause we've just been sipping Mai Tais since you got here?
I don't know what you been sipping since I got here, but Barry needs to get better, stronger, faster.
We need to train to prepare for Zoom.

Never understood why you do anything, Harrison.
That's fine with me, Garrick.
Guys, look.
We need to figure out how to stop Zoom.
Everything we've tried so far has failed.
We need to start thinking outside the box.

Maybe that's where we should start.
That's a good idea.

Hey, I just wanted to see if you could run this trace for me.
Someone messed with an ethanol transport truck this morning.
They cut the brake line and tampered with the gear shafts.
Okay, yeah.
Okay.
I am, yeah.
Yeah, I guess I'll find out what that's like once I finish CSI school.
Yeah, you will.
Look, Barry, I know that you're upset, but I was hoping it wouldn't be like this between us.
Uh... [stammers]

What if we can figure out how to control my powers?
We could find Zoom, get the jump on him.

Eddie Thawne died, so Eobard Thawne should have been erased out of existence, right?
Not necessarily.
It's possible Eobard was in the Speed Force, protecting him like a bomb shelter, keeping him alive and his time line intact.
It's what's known as a "time line remnant""
A what now?
Here, let me... show you.
This?
This... is now.
Here, today.
This is the time Thawne comes from.
This is the moment you all erased him from existence, but since Thawne is from the future, this is where his time line begins.
That's why he's still alive.
This Thawne has not yet traveled back in time to kill Barry's mother.
He's here now in this time period for the first time.
"Time line remnant."
Explains why nothing's changed.
Yeah, it also explains why he didn't know my name or that we have met before.
If Thawne dies before he can time travel again, will that save Barry's mother?
In our time line, Barry's mother is already dead, and her death is a fixed point.
Nothing can change that.
