Stop!
Kurt!

Get off me!
You're in a lot of trouble, Cadet Weller.
This is the third time you've broken your curfew, and you're not even halfway through the semester.
I thought this was a school, not a prison, sir.
We have rules.
Where were you sneaking off to?
I need to check on my sister.
- Why?

She can't defend herself.

I know you're still angry with your dad for sending you here.
No, that's not it.
This is your last warning, Cadet.
Expel me.

No... you don't get off that easy.
You need this school more than you know.
Now go outside... and wait for security to escort you back to the dorms.
Quite a mess you've gotten yourself into.
It's okay to be angry.
Anger's good.
But you have to know where to put it.
Giving a school guard a black eye is... short-sighted.
You get kicked out, then what?
No education, no prospects.
Doubt you could do much for your sister if you can't even take care of yourself.
To really protect people... you need power.
This place is the first step in getting it.
It's not too late to do the right thing.
Ma'am...
Colonel Nix is ready for you.
Good luck, Cadet Weller.
It couldn't have been the only time that I met Shepherd.
Maybe being back here on campus will help you remember.
Even if you only met her that one time, you know that she was watching you here.
The basketball game, the yearbook photo, the graduation video.
How does all of that lead to my name being on Jane's back and being part of Shepherd's plan?
Well, hopefully the Commandant can help fill in some blanks.
- And if he can't?

We don't have time, Nas.
You sure you have to go in today?
I mean, look at what's in your bed right now.
No, I gotta go in, Niki.
Okay, you gonna call me?
Yes, absolutely.
You don't have my number.
Okay, what's your number?
Missed you at the gym this morning.
I overslept.
Really?

There's a first time for everything.
Well, it's just us, Three Amigos.
Weller wants us to run a tattoo down while he follows a Sandstorm lead with Jane and Naas.
All right.

Okay, so, as we all know, the text on Jane's back is a mish-mash of various passages from famous literary works.
Buried in there are Bible verses from the book of Genesis, including Genesis 3:25.
"But it was the Father who sent his envoy, the serpent, to tempt his children and lead them astray."
I haven't been to church in a while, but that doesn't sound familiar.
That's because it doesn't exist.
There is no Genesis 3:25, but this morning, one of my systems picked up the phrase "Genesis 3:25"
over some chatter, and I was able to track it to a man named Jared Wisnewski.
Single guy, runs a local farmers co-op upstate.
A few hunting rifles registered to his name.
Okay, so a mild-mannered farmer references a Bible verse that doesn't exist in the chatter?
- Barely a lead.

But the coincidence didn't sit well with Weller, and he wanted us to dig into it.
How exactly did this alert your tattoo database?
I don't want to bore you with the intricate details.
- Since when?

It's a whole mess of algorithms and just so much math.
All right, we're gonna head up to Wisnewski's farm and see if we can find anything.
- Let's move.

You should have seen Kurt back then.
Spent more time in this office than class.
Can't believe he turned out to be an FBI agent.
Assistant Director of the FBI, actually.
Impressive.
You both work for the FBI, too?
Sure.
Any idea who she is?
That's Ellen Briggs.
What was her connection to the academy?
Ellen was in the Army.
She visited once a semester to talk about her work serving abroad.
Spent a lot of time in Africa, the Middle East.
And she took a real interest in you.
What do you mean?
Well, I was... this close to kicking you out of here, and Ellen convinced me you deserved another chance.
I don't understand.

You could say that.
What aren't you telling me, sir?
Your dad, he was having a hard time covering your tuition.

My scholarship came from a state-funded lottery.
No, it didn't.

You're telling me that Ellen Briggs funded my entire education?
She saw something in you.
Anything?
Yeah, you could say that.
Great seeing you folks today.
Tell Shepherd Kurt Weller was just here.
He knows.
Let me reintroduce you to Shepherd, otherwise known as Ellen Briggs.
- What'd you find?

Even the simplest information is hidden behind layers of military security clearances and encryption.
But now we know that she was a Major General,
Deputy Director of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.
Holding such a high rank in the military would explain how she had access to some of the classified information on Jane's body.
And why she'd have friends that have access to the rest.
Most of her record is heavily redacted or just missing from the system entirely.
I've been searching for connections, and one name popped up...

He was a training officer at Fort Meade when Shepherd was stationed there.
They worked together for years.
But then there's this.
Clark retired from a post at the DOJ a year ago, then suffered a stroke.
He's been at an assisted living center in Westchester ever since.
It took some digging, but the shell corporation paying his bills has connections to the same one that sponsored.
Weller's military school scholarship.
So Shepherd's paying Sean Clark's medical bills?
That means that he's important to her.
We've got to go and talk to that guy.
Let's move.
So, you just overslept?
You know you can still talk to me about Coach Jones, right?
Jones is dead.
That doesn't mean what he did goes away.
Do you ever think about maybe trying to talk to somebody, trying to deal with...
There's nothing to deal with.

Hello?
No car in the driveway.
It's a big farm.

- Home shooting range?

I don't remember him having an AK-47 registered in his name.
This guy's got a huge stockpile of automatic weapons.
And all the ingredients to make an ANFO bomb.
- I'm gonna call in a warrant.

Ellen Briggs... what can you tell me about her, Mr. Clark?
She's gone.
She's gone where?
Three-two count.

He...

Yeah... 1988 World Series.
Sean, do you remember me?
I'm Ellen's daughter, Remi.
You're not on the Dodgers.
Excuse us.
I just talked with Sean's doctor.
His stroke resulted in significant brain trauma.
His vascular dementia is better on some days, but...
Yeah, well, we caught him on a really bad day.
Perhaps that's why Shepherd isn't afraid of him talking.
It's another dead end.
All he can remember is baseball.
Wait, maybe talk to him about baseball.
I mean, familiar things help me with my memories.
Mr. Clark, do you like the Pirates?
Cordova and Rincon's combined no-hitter in '97?
I almost went to that game.
I know you.
How?

You play on the Mets.
You should have been a National, but they could never let that happen.
Never.
Thank you, Mr. Clark.
You have a great day.
Welcome back.
We seized a huge cache of automatic weapons, demolition charges, nitrogen fertilizer, and diesel fuel.
Wisnewski isn't a mild-mannered farmer.
He's using his farm as a domestic terrorist training camp.
So he's making an ANFO bomb?
Aluminum Nitrate Fuel Oil explosive.
Same type of bomb they used in Oklahoma City.
- Where is this guy now?

- My God!

We just got a hit on facial recognition for him.
Where?
Here, in this building.
He just exited the third floor elevator.
Counterterrorism Division.
Down!

On the ground!
- Are you armed?

What are you doing here?

I don't understand.

I work for the FBI.
Are these really necessary?

You're not in our system, and our informants don't usually make bombs in their backyard.
Agent Boyd can vouch for me.
He's on his way in, but right now, you're gonna start talking to the both of us.
I run a farmers co-op upstate.
A lot of us in the community were angry.
The government is pushing us off our land.
First, in the '90s, it was a freeway.
Now, it's a gas pipeline.
People can't make a living anymore.
Agent Boyd was concerned that the anti-government sentiment could lead to a homegrown domestic cell.
He wanted me to keep an eye on things, report back.
I identified a few key people that were angrier than others
- and passed those names along.

So, how does passing on a few names turn into a terror attack?
It was Boyd's idea.
Come again?
Are you saying an agent told you to start building ANFO bombs?
He wanted me to gauge the group's interest in acting on their anger.
The pipeline is gonna break ground on March 25th.
He wanted to know if that was an enticing target.
I brought it up.
People went along.
March 25th.

That's the codename for your pipeline attack?
Genesis means the beginning, and we were gonna end it.
By what, blowing it up?
Boyd and his team were gonna swoop in before anything got deadly.
What you're describing is entrapment.
Now, my office does not radicalize people or create a terror cell just to take them down.
- Agent Boyd.

Stop.
My office, now.
It's a successful program.
I wouldn't know.

Well, I couldn't leave a paper trail for
- this kind of operation.

These people would not be planning this attack if you hadn't have given them the idea.
I'm just moving up the timeline on the inevitable.
These people are angry.

Yeah, and that does not make them criminals.
Look, if we don't root out this kind of stuff now, we'll be dealing with the aftermath later.
Think about Ruby Ridge,
Cliven Bundy, Timothy McVeigh.
I'm shutting you down, Boyd.
You pull the plug, this group will carry out the attack without Jared.
Not if we arrest them first.
We don't have the evidence to make arrests.
This was all about getting them for the big attack.
And we've got Jared's weapons and his bomb materials.
A third grader could make more ANFO, and you know it.
We let this go, and something bad is gonna happen.
I want you to put together everything that you have on this and then give it to me.
I will decide whether this op moves forward or not.
We were hoping these photos could help you remember something.
Who is she?
You remember her?
I have this feeling.

I can't...

I know her, don't I?
That's Shepherd, our mother.
Her real name is Ellen Briggs.
She was an Army General.
I need to know everything about her.
Well, we don't know much right now, and the files we found on her are mostly redacted.
I need to see them.
I'm not sure that the FBI is willing to hand over classified documents to someone in custody.
I know her, I...
Look, I know it's frustrating and...
How am I supposed to help if they won't share everything with me?
What are they hiding?
I'll talk to Nas, okay?
- You okay?

I'm doing great.

How exactly did you crack the Bible verse tattoo?
You told me on the phone you picked up the phrase on some chatter.
You're never this interested in how I solve the tattoos.
This one points to an off-the-book program being run out of this office, so I need to know what is happening under my watch, and I need to know now.
Okay.
I linked the tattoo database to a secret NSA data collection program.
Omaha?

Daylight on steroids is more accurate.
So you've been using illegal wiretaps to solve these tattoos?
- Patterson.

- Really?

I have to use every resource that I have.
We're running out of time to figure out what all of this adds up to.
That is my call to make, not yours, understand?
As much as I want to shut this program down, we can't risk an attack being carried out by this domestic cell.
Great, I've outlined a way to wrap this up in three months.
Forget it.

- We do it my way.

I've been working on this for two years.
Yeah, and you messed it up, so you want me to keep you on this, tell me everything that I need to know.
These are the players that Jared planned the pipeline attack with.
So what do we know about them?
Tom Moses, cattle rancher who turned a peaceful community protest into a small riot.
The incident ignited this powder keg in the first place.
His cousin Kevin Pabst is a distributor who brings the co-op's cattle to the market.
And lastly, Tess Bartell.
She served two tours in the Iraq war, took over the family farm when she returned.
What about the rest of the community?
Are they aware of an attack?
A few other people in the community were interested in joining the cause.
We were gonna read 'em in soon.
Let's focus on these three.
We'll make arrests when we've got enough evidence on them.
Jared's been out of contact with them since your team raided his farm.
He needs to let 'em know that the plan is safe, that the attack can still move forward.
No.

He's the leader of the group.
If he disappears, they'll know something's wrong.
We have a prearranged meeting spot that's easy to surveil.
I can do this.
Jared?
Hey, Tess, listen.
Your place is crawling with cops.
I'm fine, but we have to talk.
Get Kevin and Tom and meet in the normal spot in an hour.
No.

What's wrong with the usual spot?

If the Feds knew about your farm, they could know about our meeting spot, too.
Tess, there's no way they could know about that.
See you in an hour.
This is not a good position.
Not one sightline to where they're meeting.
If we get any closer, they'll spot us.
We'll know everything that's going on through the mic we put in Jared's truck.
We got something.
A jeep and a bike approaching from the north end.
Got it.

Anything seems off, we move in, make the arrests.
- Copy?

How the hell did the FBI know to raid your farm, Jared?
Nosy neighbor.

They got the weapons and the bombs.
They could know everything.
Nothing pointed to our plan or to any of you.
We have to stay the course with Genesis 3:25.
The pipeline is months away from breaking ground.
We need to gather the others and strike today before the cops launch a full investigation.
Strike what?

Watch the news tonight.

Tess, don't cut me out!

You're a fugitive now, Jared.

I need to know what you're targeting to make sure that it has a real impact.
You don't trust me?
Or is something else going on here, Jared?
Tess, what are you doing?
Please, put the gun away.
Jared's blown.

He can handle it, she's about to change up the target.
Team, move in!
Why didn't you answer your phone all day, Jared?
You're being paranoid.
Are you trying to set us up?
You working with the Feds?
We've come too far to let you ruin it.
It's over.

The FBI is listening.
Go!
Weller, Tess is headed to you.
Stay on her.
Show me your hands!

Get on the ground!

This is everything that we have on Shepherd.
I've included images of Fort Meade and Fort Hood.
That's where we know she was stationed.
Does any of it seem familiar?
No, none of it.

If her name is Ellen Briggs, does that mean that my last name is Briggs, too?
We didn't find any record on you or Jane.
There's...

Why wouldn't she have adopted us?
Well, maybe she did, and then the records were erased.
Roman, there's still a lot more that we don't know about her.
It doesn't make any sense.
What?
These files, they... they show a soldier who betrayed her country.
A terrorist.
That's not what I feel when I look at her.
It's something different.

You were taught to follow her your whole life.
It makes sense that you would feel this deep connection to her.
But if I have these feelings toward somebody who is such... a monster... what does that make me?
You could have stopped this months ago.
You didn't.

- We can salvage this.

This group is out there with plans to hit a new target today...

We have a warrant out for Tess Bartell's arrest.
We find her, and we drill down.
We won't be doing anything.
Hand in your service weapon and your badge.
Your career with the FBI is over.
- Any luck tracking Tess down?

She ditched her bike and has gone completely dark.
Field agents are talking to farmers who might be involved.
So far, we've come up empty.
What about possible targets?
Kevin isn't talking, and there are five construction companies working on the pipeline.
The project had to be signed off on by a dozen state officials.
Any one of them could be a target.
I want agents at every one of those places.
No.
- This is bad.

A farming supply warehouse five miles from the orchard reported a robbery.
1,000 pounds of nitrogen fertilizer and a dozen drums of diesel fuel.
Tess didn't steal that much by herself.

Now they've got enough explosives to level any building.
I understand you're angry.
I was, too, when I discovered one of my agents was running an op targeting innocent people.
I've seen what happens when people in the government abuse their power, and it's not something I stand for, so give me the chance to make this right before anyone else gets hurt.
I just wanted to keep what was mine, my family's.
We're losing everything to that pipeline.
And that's not fair, but neither is killing innocent people.
I never wanted to kill anybody.
Yeah, but Tess is a different story.
We know she's planning on targeting something big.
Kevin, everyone that she kills will be on your hands.
Can you live with that?
It's not too late to do the right thing.
Tess blames the Bureau of Land Management.
They've been carving up our properties for decades.
Their headquarters are here in Manhattan.
The federal building on 57th.
That's what she and the other farmers are gonna hit.
I'm sure of it.
Thank you.
Go!
We're evacuating the building, but getting 50 floors of people out of here
- takes time.

- Where's the bomb squad?

So far, nothing, but, you know, they've got a lot of ground to cover and not enough agents yet.
We'll help you with evacuation.
Guys, I want you to set up a perimeter outside.
Go.
Tasha, Reade, you three, search down the street to the underground parking lot.

Service hallways... how many?

One on the west side and one on the east.
Both go to loading docks.
- Okay.

I'll take the east side.

- Let me know if you see anything.

- Guys, we have a problem.

A truck just blew through three red lights heading west down 57th, headed straight for the federal building.
On it.
Got eyes on it.
Team, move to the street now.
Stop!
Stop your truck!
Tess, freeze!

Get down on the ground, now!
You're surrounded.
Back off!
Give me the detonator.
Or what?

I blow the truck, and we're all dead.
You've gotta listen to me, Tess.
- You don't understand.

The system does have problems, but killing innocent people isn't the answer.
This is the only way for our voice to be heard, the only way to make things change.
You're a soldier, right?
So you've seen what happens when people use violence to send a message, how many lives it destroys.
That is the easy way out, and you know it.
Soldiers are trained to do what's right, not what's easy.
You need to give me that detonator, Tess.
Hey, look, a friend of mine at the Justice Department is running down original copies of Shepherd's redacted service record.
It's a long shot, but it's something.
What else can we do?
Any break we can catch right now will help.
I heard what happened earlier.
That was a risky move you made, standing in front of the truck like that.
I had to stop it before it hurt anyone else, to get it back under control.
The off-the-books program?
Or something else?
It's a control freak's worst nightmare to find out that someone else was at the wheel for the most crucial parts of their life.
You think I'm a control freak?
Shepherd may have once had a say in your future, but, Kurt, don't let her drive you mad today by second-guessing your leadership over this office.
If someone else was sitting in that chair, they might have seen Agent Boyd's program sooner.
I've just been so focused on Sandstorm.
And personal complications?
Yeah, that's part of it.
Great leaders know that it is impossible to take everything on themselves.
You do that, and you really do start to lose sight of the bigger picture.
But as a leader, there are some things I can do better.
You want me to stop using Omaha?
Using illegal wiretaps or invading the privacy of citizens is exactly the type of corruption that we need to stop.
Omaha could help us find Shepherd and Borden before it's too late.
What if we only use it for that and not the tattoos?
Patterson, what you've gone through, that is unimaginable.
I can understand you're frustrated, but there has to be a line.
You know it.
So, we will find them, and we'll make them pay, but it can't be at the cost of compromising yourself.
Okay.
- I'll disconnect Omaha from my systems.

But there's something you should know before I pull the plug.
- What did I just say?

I ran his name through Omaha, and I got a hit on an archived wiretap, a recorded phone conversation from last year.
Sean Clark, wonderful to hear from you.
It's been a while, Assistant Director Mayfair.
- Holding things down in New York for us?

- Why would Mayfair and Clark be talking?

Look, I'm calling about the agent you put up to run the DC office.
He's the best I've got.
I think it's a little premature for him to be a candidate.
He should spend some more time with you in New York before taking over an office of his own.
He's a bit raw, to be blunt.
Well, that's one word for it, but he gets results.
I'm sure he does, but if he stays in New York,
I think he can do great things.
All right.

You'll see someday.
I hope you're right.

She never told me that I was up for that.
Maybe she didn't want to get your hopes up.
Clark blocked the chance for me to be promoted, to relocate to DC.
He wasn't just talking baseball gibberish.
What do you mean?
He told me that I was playing for the Mets, the New York Mets, but he said I should have been a National.
The Washington Nationals.
He was trying to tell me about that transfer, but he said they could never let it happen.
"They" being Sandstorm?
That phone call was from last year, so Shepherd wanted me to stay in New York, to be here when Jane showed up in that bag.
What else does he know about Shepherd and her plan?
We still on for the gym tomorrow?
Yes, and I promise I won't sleep through my alarm this time.
I'm sorry if I pushed you earlier.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
No, I appreciate it.

For the first time in a while, I feel like I can breathe, like I can have fun again.
Who is she?
It's not even like that.
Well, you'd better not mess this one up.
- Tasha.

You deserve to be happy, so don't let anything get in the way of that, including yourself.

Yeah, I know.
I will see you tomorrow.
Good night.
You were trying to tell me about a promotion you blocked.
You did that for Ellen, didn't you?
You kept me from going to Washington.

You were supposed to be a National, but your career is with the Mets.
Ellen wanted to keep me in New York.
You're the face of the franchise, her star player.
Why is she so invested in me?
You're a Met.
You have to be a Met.
You don't understand.
I don't.

It's the Truman Protocol.
It's everything.
But no one knows.
What is the Truman Protocol?
Someone could be listening.
Let's go to your room.
We can talk privately there.
Hello, Kurt.
Hey.
What are you thinking for dinner tonight?
You want Chinese or Indian, maybe?
Why all the killing?
What?
Nas showed me the files.
The attacks, the bodies Shepherd has dropped over the years, all of my crimes, what's it all for?
I want to understand why I'd follow someone like her.
She believes the system only serves those in power instead of the people it's supposed to.
Is she wrong?
Seems like the government controls everything.
Look at us, I'm...

How do you know you're not brainwashed now?
We're on the right side of this.
Look, Shepherd's beliefs may seem noble, but she doesn't care who she hurts, and whatever feelings that you're having for her, that's what she used to control you.
She uses people, just like the government, and I help the FBI because I want to.
No one is forcing me to do anything.
They tell you where to go and what you're allowed to say.
Every minute of your day is spent doing something that they want you to do, I mean, when was the last time you made a decision for yourself?
Hey, you want another drink?

Your finest vodka soda.
I don't drink soda, girl.
I got juice, though.
I could make you a screwdriver.
At least there's some Vitamin C in this.
Okay, nerd.
Easy.
You do realize I work for the FBI, right?
Get your cuffs out.
Didn't you leave Freddy for this?
I left Freddy 'cause he was out of control.
This is just fun.
You know, sometimes I look at you, and I feel like you've maybe never had a carefree day in your whole life.
You gotta learn how to relax.
Hey, not bad for a first-timer.
Thank you.
I still can't believe you have never played.
Skee-ball before, how is that even possible?
I know we said the past is just the past, but this is much more mysterious than your tattoos.
Well, let's just say
I had a very unusual childhood.
So, what will this get us?
How does a brand-new
- pencil eraser sound?

What about a plastic set of vampire fangs?
Better.
You know, I thought I was never gonna hear from you again.
Thought maybe I'd screwed it up.
No, it wasn't you.

I needed to see things differently.
Well, I'm glad you did.
Um, wow.

Thousands.

Are you saying we can't do it?
We can do it, but that is gonna take a serious level of commitment.
I'm thinking 30 or more hours of Skee-ball spread over ten or so days... depending on how your shot improves.
But if you want to head down that path, there is no turning back.
Are you sure you're ready for this?
That shark is mine.
I finally finished my paperwork.
Have you had dinner yet?
I ate a Go-Gurt.
A what?
A Go-Gurt, that's what you eat when you don't have time to eat a yogurt.
It's like a tube of yogurt.
Yeah, that's not dinner.
Why don't we get something to eat?
I can't.
I'm still trying to ID the reference numbers from Shepherd's redacted documents.
Hey, are you okay?
Yes.

- I'm fine.

You wanting me to de-stress is stressing me out.
Please, I have so much work to do, and Weller wants me to do it with one hand tied behind my back, and if we have any hope of catching Shepherd and Borden, someone's got to be here to push the buttons
because... the buttons don't push themselves.
Patterson.
Today is an unfortunate day, Kurt.
What have you done to him?
I had to use some very powerful medicine to get him lucid.
Make sure he didn't say too much.
I'm not worried.
I've got to say, it's nice... to be in the same room as you again.
You know, that day we met at the academy, you had so much anger inside of you but so much potential to fight for what's right.
I saw a lot of myself in you.
Is that why you've been manipulating my life?
The scholarship, the job transfer, sending Jane to me with all the tattoos.
What's it all for?
Kurt, you and I, we're... we're saving this country.
I didn't know when I first met you that day how important you would be to all of this.
When Remi and I formulated the tattoo plan,
I saw an opportunity to put you in it, and it feels comforting to know that you'll be there to help when the time comes.
Why do you think that I will ever help you?
Be part of your plan?
We're the same, Kurt.

We both fight for what's right.
We both hate corruption in all its forms.
You've seen yourself, first-hand, that this country needs a revolution.
We're on the same team here.
How many more will have to die before you realize we want the same thing?
No, we don't.

That's what the law says.
Did you ever consider the law is wrong?
Therein lies the big difference between us.
You play by the rules.
I believe the rules need to change.
Only I know what it really means to make sacrifices for a greater cause than yourself.
I'm sorry, old friend.
Don't!
No, it's okay.

You know that.
In order to protect the plan.
You didn't have to do that!
You needed to see that you're not the only one who's suffering here!
This is hard on me, too!
But it'll all be worth it.
I have to go now, but we'll meet again, and you'll have no choice but to join me.
No.
There.
You can let yourself out.
It's really a shame.
In another life... we could have been family.
