- [typewriter clacking] - [people speaking indistinctly on radio]
[knocking on door]
Oh.
You were supposed to drop the dog off on Tuesday.
- This is getting ridiculous.

- Can I have Lenny, please?

- Why not?

He got hit by a car, a Saab, and I just didn't have time to call you.
I'm sorry.
I know this is probably devastating for you.
I mean, I've had a week, so, I've kind of moved through it.
But, uh, I have the number of the woman that hit him, if you wanna call her and cry.
Do you wanna call her and cry?

[dog yips, whimpers]
[Carolyn] Hey, boy.

- You belong in an asylum.

Just me all chained up and drooling and... and lobotomized with my balls cut off.
You never had any balls to begin with.
I did before I married you!
But there's one ball you can't castrate.
That's the mind!
- [typewriter clacking] - [Sam] Those balls are just... balls.
A man's true ball... is the mind.
[upbeat music playing]
Ronnie takes out his pen... signs the picture.
And he says, "It's a good thing Bonzo is a Democrat, otherwise he'd have won the nomination."
[crowd laughing]
You're... you're hilarious.
Ladies, hi.
I see you've met Sebastian Howard, our producer.
Uh, "Bash," please.
Just know that he's the one writing your checks, so, be nice.
I don't like to talk about money, okay?

And wrestling is an art, despite my mother's opinion, which is wrong.
[Sam] I thought you were in Peru.
Yeah, I...

Even Miss Serious over here. [Chuckles]
So, what moves have you guys learned?
We've been learning to fall on our backs without hurting ourselves.
And pain faces.
What... what about powerbombs?

Salty's famous for his DDTs.

Yeah, yeah, Bash, Salty didn't work out.
Cherry's our new wrestling coach now.
Um... does she have any wrestling experience?
Um...

Yeah.

- Blood.

- Storytelling.

Now, I know it's exciting to be in the midst of a big-shot producer, but I have something even shinier...
A script.
Hot off the Xerox.
I only made ten copies, so, we have to share 'em.
And I'm just gonna cast as we go along, starting with Ruth.
Yes!

Uh, yeah.

"The year is 1999.
Nuclear war has reduced the Earth to a smoking ruin.
Lost tribes of women wander the land scavenging for water, food and an even scarcer resource, men.
[women cheer]
For the privilege of breeding with civilization's last male specimen, women wrestle for domination.
- [Bash grunts]

Welcome to the world of GLOW."
[women cheering]
I'm sorry, Madame, but there is a woman outside.
She says she wants to wrestle for a night with... the Specimen.
"Suddenly, a wall collapses, and in strides the Leather Virgin, a nomadic road warrior whose tough-as-nails persona conceals a deep well of passion and virginity."
Are you the keeper of the Specimen?
[Tammé] I am.

That's no concern of yours.
The only thing you need to know is that I am ready to fight.
[Tammé] We'll see about that.

"Ogress, a giant half-cyborg, half-woman, enters."
Uh-oh.
Me Ogress.

All right, now the next part's just wrestling.
- Yeah.

Then cut to commercial, and then act two.
[Ruth] "Interior, underground bunker."
What?
[Debbie] The Over-Madames have lied to you.
Men are real.
We can restore the world to the way it was before the war and women's lib.
- [in raspy voice] Men?

- [Dawn] We worship only...

Wail, wail, wail.
[Sam] Oh, come on.

Okay.

[Arthie] The men never died.
She harvests them for food.
[Debbie] Who?
- Koontar, the Man-Eater...

- "Kuntar."

- Kuntar.

"Nympho Phoebe, Mutant Maude and the Sexecutioner come to a closed door."
It's a dead end.
- Or... a trap.

[Ruth] "Boom!

In walks Koontar."
"Kuntar."
Okay. "Kuntar, a vision of hideousness."
Oh, yeah, you do it.

Oh.

Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, okay.
I am Kuntar!
Good God.

- Oh, sorry, where is that?

Oh, come on.

Actually, know what?

- We're almost at the end.

- I could use a break.

Oh.
All right, all right.

[Rhonda] Do it right.
[women chattering]
So, all right, what did you think, Bashy?
And you can be honest with me.
There is... so much about this that's working.
A lot.
Well, you hired me to, you know, do a different kind of wrestling show.
- So, I, you know...

[Bash sighs]
You know what?

- Have some drinks.

Yeah, let's not...

You know?

Who wants to go to Malibu?

- [women] I do!

- [Jenny] I could go.

[women sigh]
- [Bash] Let's fly, all right?

Hey, hey, Florian!

Yeah, I got 20 people headed your way, okay?
That's my butler.

I can't hear you, but I agree!
Oh!
Hey, Sam.

'Cause I was thinking it might be a better use of my time to go home and work on my lines.
You know, see if I can get off-book by tomorrow?
You don't wanna suck up to the producer like your pal Debbie?
Trying to keep a safe distance from my pal Debbie.
- It's a party.

I got drunk and slept with her husband.
Well, lucky for you, he's not invited this time.
- [Jenny] Melrose, can we all fit?

Guys, I've had ten strippers and a baby pool in this puppy.
Cram your asses in here!
[women whooping]
[Melrose] Come on, get in.
I'll ride with you.
- [sighs] You don't have to.

It's that one, right?
Yeah.
[Cherry] Hey.
Where was my part?
What do you mean?
In your jerk-off space opera.

It's a post-nuke dystopia, thank you.
I trained these girls all fucking week.
I watched tapes, I broke down moves.
- I wanna be on camera, Sam.

Fine.
We'll do it on the way there.
[Sam] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

[Justine] There wasn't room in the limo, and I don't have a car.
Also, may I say that script was your best work since Blood Disco?
It has the surrealist quality of your early works like Oedipussy, Venus in Chains, Gina the Machina, but with a more subversive message about the limitations of feminism and nuclear power.
Get in.
She gets it.
♪ I heard a voice say "Tonight by the wood ♪
♪ You will find something unique ♪ [robot] Hello, ladies.

[in robotic voice] Thank you.
Oh.

That is a real Lichtenstein.
Couch made by Picasso.
That one I...

The bowls are made of crystal.

- but she's like, "It's crystal."

Yeah, there's a robot, you know?
Ah, there is a robot.

Oh, it nodded.

[Melrose gasps]
There are drugs in the fuckin' robot.
[Bash] So, not just caviar, but also fancy mustards or pâté.
- [Sheila] Beef stew?

- Pork?

- Chicken of the sea.

Anything canned under the sun.
That was almost the Howard Foods slogan.

Mother, not so much.
Lucky Charms, anyone?
I would love some.
My parents never let me eat sugary cereals as a kid.
- [Florian] Oh.

So, this is your butler guy?
[Bash] Oh, yeah, yeah.

We met in third grade.

I got plastic forks from Gelson's.

- Genius.

- [new-wave music playing] - [women chattering]
I know this sounds needy, but can you please never leave me alone at this party?
- It that an "Asteroids" in a house?

I have to use the restroom.
♪ Whiskey goes in the punch And rum also goes in the punch ♪
♪ And we are out of pineapple rings ♪
Oh, thank God.

[over speakers] ♪ All right ♪
Are you having fun?
Just 'cause we're at a party doesn't mean we're at all okay.
Talk to me again, I'll throw you through the window.
♪ All right ♪
- Seems like you could use a drink.

Especially that final scene when you realize the meat grinder is in her vagina and the rapist starts to... [chuckling] Oh, man.

So poetic, political, and just...

Okay, we get it.
You love his movies.
Oh, you're the director.

[sighs]
Oh, my God!

Did you get lost?

Where's Bash?
Oh, he took Kuntar aside to speak privately.
- [singsong] You know what that means.

[Jenny laughing]

Are you tripping?
We're appreciating this piece of art.
Oh, yeah.

- Can you give us a little alone time?

I'm just hiding from Debbie.
I'll go.
So, what is this, the old Malibu ambush?
You gonna ply me with some drinks and tell me you don't like my vision?
Sam, I hired you to direct a wrestling show.
Which I came up with.

It was the seed of an idea.
- I'm...

I meant the way "Ms. Pac-Man" is different from "Pac-Man."
As in, almost the exact same thing, but with a bow in her hair.
Not set in the desert after a nuclear war.
Oh, okay.

The Iron Sheik.

- I don't even know who that is.

It doesn't matter.

That's all he has to do.

We need to simplify.
Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.

Gorgeous ladies... wrestling.
Okay.

All right, you hired me because I'm a professional.
I know how to do this.

I'm not some 25-year-old child who thinks he knows everything.
I need a drink.
- Try the punch.

Where are the drugs, robot?
How does it refill itself?
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

- Rhonda, down here.

Do you see any baggies?
- [Melrose] No, there's gotta be a...

Hey!

- What?

I got something even better for you to fondle.
- Who likes glittery things?

- Is that a Bob Mackie gown?

Why do you think my parties are so legendary?
- We drink, we smoke...

We dance, we get naked, then we put on these awesome costumes and the cycle repeats itself.
Why don't you tell the ladies there's a costume closet on the second floor?
[Melrose squeals]
[Melrose] You guys!
Costume party!

[women whooping and laughing]
Now, this I can get used to.
Play around.

Maybe these could help inspire you in your wrestling personas.
[Rhonda] Ooh.
[Bash] That's right.

[Tammé] And would Madame Xenothrob,
- the slaver-pimp, wear fur?

- Go with what feels right.

- Look, I'm a beekeeper.

[laughs]
[Bash] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

I'm a heel.

No, no, no.
Kids are gonna love you.
You're not a serial killer.
Look at this face, huh?

You're smiling all the time.

We need bright colors, fun.

Here.

Here we go.
I really thought I was gonna like this.
I thought I was gonna like...

But I don't even know who this is.
- Hey, hey, hey.

We just gotta strip you down to your essence here.
Naked already?
[sighs]
Wow.
You see me.
[slurring] I am raising a baby with someone I can't even talk to.
And if I leave him, where do I live?
Do I live here with you?
[chuckles]
Why am I feeling guilty about leaving that asshole?
And he's...
What's the word?

He is so stupid.
Flor... when you cheat on your wife... don't admit everything to her.
Lie.
Lie to her, Flor.
Flor, I'm gonna sit down on the floor.
[clears throat]
I feel like I'm losing my mind every 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes is... about as long as I can possibly pretend that everything's okay.
And I don't have anybody to talk to about it.
Except you.
Oh.
Here.
This is for when you start puking.

Okay. [Sighs]
Hey, uh, can you help me with something?
- Yeah.

[Florian] I'd have Mike fly her home, but he's on a beer run.
Is your hair a dance floor?
Let's get you off the dance floor.
- [Florian] What's her address?

- [Ruth] It's 3025 Linda Vista in Pasadena.

Okay.
You're not my friend.
[engine starts] [mouthing]
[clears throat]
Am I good?
[Sheila] Yeah.
[Bash] Ladies and gentlemen!
Introducing the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling!
[women cheering]
Yes!

[women laughing and whooping]
Whoa, a gun.

What the fuck is this?
Costumes, characters.
You look ridiculous.
This is my new character, Sam.

- We're exploring some ideas.

Sam, your ideas are so complicated.
Okay?

- Me?

She's a sexy party girl.
And she's a rip-off of Madonna, who is so huge right now.
- What?

- [squeals] - [Bash] She walks into the ring, there's no backstory, there's no dialogue about where she came from.
Look.

- Her eyes!

Bingo.

You're a jock, you're an Arab, you're a big black girl.
The fuck you say?
It's not a judgment.
It's just what I and the entire world see with our eyes.
And in wrestling, that is the foundation upon which we need to build.
- But I'm Indian, not Arab.

Backstory.

It's about type.

Intelligent and whimsical?
No.

- You mean stereotypes.

Don't take that gun.
- Take the gun.

Uh... which one of you's in charge?
[Ruth sputters]
Did somebody call a meeting?
Oh, yes!

Uh...

- No, I'm Kuntar, a vision of hideousness.

There is no world where people look at her and see hideous or evil.
- She's apple pie and ice cream.

Those calls were real.
And you took this job because no one else would hire you.
Who are you now, Robert Evans?

- You haven't done anything.

So what?

Your idiot butler probably has ten Oscar-winning ideas.
- I do.

- Florian kicks ass!

- [grunts] - [robot crackling]
Aah!

- Whew.

[Bash] Shit.
[robot] Hola. ¿Cómoestá?

[robot speaks in distorted voice] Mi casa es sucasa.
Spanish.
- [robot zaps, powers down] - [Ruth] Ooh!
- I hope you're fucking happy.

Tell your mommy to take it out of your allowance.
I'm done.
[Ruth] Hey.
- Hey.

- [groans]

You're leaving?
Why?

No, I just don't want the show to fall apart.
Really?

- Yes.

It's all I have right now.
Oh, God.
Sam, you're the director.

We respect you.
We need you.
- But maybe Bash is right, too.

I just...

Maybe your script is too complicated.
[sighs]
I'm a homewrecker.
I wrecked someone's home.
Yeah.

But I don't get to play any of these characters if there's no show.
Goddamnit.
[sighs]
I'm not easy to work with.

[scoffs]
I'm cranky, and I don't take criticism well, and I don't like being told what to do.
Is that an apology?
Apologies, compromise... not my bag.

I just don't get it.

What are you talking about, Sam?

They're not comedies.
Oh.
I'll tell you what.
We'll do it your way.
All right?
I'll make your show.
I'll listen.
I'll... [mutters]
Compromise.
- In return...

- Okay?

I want you to read my script.
The one from this morning?
No.

Nobody gets it and no one wants to pay for it.
I don't need to read it.

You should read it.

There's, like, time travel, Oedipal shit...
Sam, look at me.
You make GLOW, I will make any... crazy time-travel sex-romp movie you want.
What's it called?
Mothers and Lovers.
Don't say anything.
I don't want notes.
It's a great title.
Sam, I love it.
It's deep.
[in Chinese accent] I am one who is cute like panda.
I'm in danger.

[laughs] Trick you!
Because I am fast like dragon!
[grunts]
I am Fortune Cookie... and Asian.
[Bash whistles]
- Yeah.

[in growling voice] I'm Beirut, the Mad Bomber.
[growls]
I will destroy your American way of living.
You know what?

[in normal voice] So expected.
[in raspy voice] I'm Scab, and I'm your worst nightmare.
I'll gut your Gucci and blast your Beemer.
Die, yuppie scum!
[cackles]
I got chills.
Yeah, you would.
Hi, I'm Melrose.

[in gruff voice] And Daddy's been a bad, bad boy!
[growls]
Come here, Daddy!
I think, uh...

Yeah, just a tad.
I'm Sheila.
Anything to add?
No, I...

They call me Machu Picchu, the Peruvian Fortress.
Strong and proud.
I'm a good guy.
- [Sam] Girl.

I'm Ju... [scoffs] What is it?
[Sam] Junkchain.
I'm Junkchain, and I bring the pain.
Peace.
- I'm Ethel.

[both] And we're the Beat Down Biddies.
You want a piece of me?

Oh, yeah, I'll come at you.

I'll make you shit your pants!
Y'all stupid for going to work every day and paying taxes. [Scoffs]
I let the government pay for all of my shit, and I lives like a queen.
A Welfare Queen.
[laughs]
This is like half my brain, half your brain.
She's our masterpiece.
Oh, hello.
I didn't see you, because I was looking at my beaker full of a science experiment.
And earlier, I was doing algebra... because I'm Britannica... the Smartest Woman in the World.
[Sam] Throw those on for a second.
- Yeah, that sells it.

I can't see. [Chuckles]
I'm a two-time...
Olympic... medalist... who loves America.
I'm Liberty Belle.
[whispers] Can I please do this character?
[in Southern drawl] Because I'm a two-time Olympic medalist who loves America.
I'm Liberty Belle.
I'm the athlete.

She seemed more all-American.
Just...

We got a different part for you.

Why don't I believe you?
I am Vicky Viking.
Yes.
Men... walk in fear through these city streets.
For it is there you may meet me.
And though I am only moderately attractive...
I am desperate.
And there's nothing more dangerous than a desperate woman.
And there is no woman more desperate... than the Homewrecker.
It's not working.
Yeah.
Did you want me to push it further, or...?
[Sam] No, it's just...
- I don't know.

- I mean, who is she?

Help us out, Ruth.
Um...
Who do you think you are?
