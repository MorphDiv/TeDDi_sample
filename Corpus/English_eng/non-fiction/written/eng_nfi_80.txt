Knock, knock.
Hey, brought ya breakfast in bed.
- Oh, thank you.

You know I didn't get much sleep last night, so I'm feeling a little... punchy.
Interesting, I'm feeling a little punchy myself.
Are ya?
Yeah, I are.
So, uh, what would one do if they're feelin' punchy?
Well, I would imagine if he or she had a punch card, one might use it.

"Shwah," indeed.
To be honest, I didn't want breakfast.
Oh, to be honest, I didn't make any.

Did Josh come down yet?
I hate being late.

How's that different from your on-time sweats?
What are you doing?

I know.
Give me those, fool.
And where the hell is the coffee?
You bitches don't do anything around here.
That's not true.

Ugh, that stupid punch card.
It's so gross that Gabi has that disgusting sexual arrangement with Josh.
You're just jealous.
No!

How many punches do they have anyway?
- Ten.

Make that nine.
That was great!
So great.
I mean, this punch card thing is the best.
Yeah, it's amazing.
We're having sex without feelings.
I mean, I had feelings in my parts, but... not in my hearts.
I gotta be honest with you, Gabi.
I did not think you could handle an all sex non-emotional liaison.
That's funny, because I thought the same thing about you.
Without the big word at the end.
Ooh.
We almost forgot somethin'.
Oh, no, no.

N... no.

I don't know what that is, but I don't do that either.
Gabi, it's a hole-puncher for our punch cards.
Aw.

Man, I can't believe we already used one up.
Yeah.
We only got nine left.
Yeah.

Why do I have to use the first punch?
You know what?

Age before beauty.
Well, and to be fair, I will use the next punch.
How's now?
Maybe this time, beauty can come first.
Oh, my God!

No, I can't.

I'm having lots of sex now.
No, no.

Ugh!

Yes.

He loves your cooking.
Which he actually thinks is my cooking, so in a way, he loves me.
Mm, yeah.

Yeah, now.
But I have a plan to be his new girlfriend.
Okay, look, it all centers around our lunches.
First, I establish myself as a confidant.
Then, I subliminally undermine his relationship.
And then finally, when my abuelita's hex starts working... his relationship will burn to the ground.
And I will be there to rise like a phoenix from the ashes.
As his new girlfriend.
Wow, not having sex for a long time makes you a little crazy.
Yeah, well, having sex for a day makes you a little judgy.
[scoffs] All I'm saying is what Josh and I have is working.
Okay?

We're having sex without all the neediness and the drama.
And the caring and the trust and the intimacy.
Yeah, exactly.

Gabi, I know you better than anyone, and you can not handle a purely sexual relationship.
It's just a matter of time before things get weird.
It's not gonna get weird, okay?

Boyfriends are out, punch cards are in.
That is the stupidest thing I have ever heard.
Now cook me something that I can pretend is mine so Kendrick falls in love with me.
What are you doin'?
All the scratching in the world won't get rid of that second chin.
I'm on WebMD trying to figure out what's wrong with my face.
Oh, well, maybe you just allergic to ugly.
It says the itch could be anything.
From using a new shaving cream to...
Wait, what's this?
Oh, that's the new detergent I'm using.

"The burning is how you know it's working."
What the hell kind of detergent is this?
Cheap.
I got it in the discount aisle.
Wait.

Yep.

I added a scoop to the water... waited till the smoke cleared... and then I added the laundry.
I wiped my face with his boxers.

What the hell are you doing shopping in the discount aisle?
Josh is loaded.
What's your angle?
No angle.
Every month, Josh gives me a cleaning budget.
Which I manage properly.
So you buy cheap products and then pocket the rest?
Damn it!
[chuckles]
Don't worry.

If you cut me in for half.
Damn it!
I can't believe I'm being blackmailed by somebody who's not black!
And barely a male.
Okay, you're in.
Yay!
Now I can buy that Japanese toilet I've had my eye on.
I've heard it has three bidet settings:
gentle, strong, and Fire Island.
Uh... hey, guys... anyone else feel a little itchy?
- Oh, no.

Why would we feel itchy?

I'm gonna go call my concierge doctor and see what he thinks it is.
Great idea, boss!
What if the doctor tells him his itch is from a cheap detergent?
Crap!

Quick!

Best day ever!
Mm-hm.

Yep.
A lot of it.
On... [whispers] my junk.
Well, it could be many things.
Dermatitis, an allergy...
Do you have any new sexual partners?
[laughs]
Actually, doc, um...
I have a little thing going on with a...
Wait.

Before we jump to any conclusions, why don't you take a few pictures of the affected area and email them to me.
Hopefully they won't end up in my junk box.
[laughs]
(Sofia) Hey, do you remember how stupid you thought my stupid plan was?
Talk louder, Sofia.

Well, my stupid plan worked.

Because Kendrick got into a huge fight with his girlfriend, so I invited him over for dinner to be his shoulder to cry on.
And he said yes.

Ha!

Now she's the leftovers.
So, ah, what famous specialty of yours am I making for you and your maybe future boyfriend tonight?
Well, he says he likes a good baba ghanoush.
Can you make a baba ghanoush?
Oh, I can make a baba do anything.

Um, I'm guessing you said, "Ask Josh" because you want to tell me how great your sex punch card thing's going?
Oh, well, since you asked, amazing.
You were so wrong.

Okay, it just got weird.
So, he was just... rocking out with his... out?
Yeah!
I mean, he was taking pictures from every angle.
I mean, from the front and then from the back.
And then through the legs and then over the shoulder.

Ew!
- He took a peni-Rama?

Why would he do that?
Well, why do you think, Gabi?
- To text it to you.

Yes.

No, we're not dating.
Exactly.

Oh, my God.
What am I supposed to do when he sends them to me?
I mean, h... how am I supposed to respond?
- I miss landlines.

Kendrick's on his way, so can you just chop while you freak out?
Yeah, but how..,. how am I supposed to feel?

Am I... am I turned off?

Gabi, if you have to ask, it's not for you.
Look, Gabi, you used to have feelings for him so you can't just suddenly start having sex with him and not have feelings.
I mean, maybe Josh can.

But you can't!
- You don't have it in you, Gabi.

I do, I've got it in me!

Oh, my God, Gabi.

- Okay.

- And send to Josh.

Totally cool with it.

What happened to your bra?
I left it at work.
Well, I got rid of the Tude.
It's about time.

Okay, listen.

- the key is to stay cool.

- Deny, deny, deny.

- You sit down.

- Oh, hey, Yolanda.

What the hell was that?

I panicked.
And I don't think it means that.
Hey, guys.
I talked to my doctor.
Be cool, Yolanda.

He told me what the itch could be from.
Could be an allergy, could be dermatitis, and there is a slight possibility but practically impossible chance that it's an STD.
- I pick STD.

But the only person I'm having sex with is Gabi.
Exactly.

Hold up, wait a second, Elliot.
Josh, Gabi didn't give you an STD.
Yes, she did.
No punch card, no STD.
Punch card, STD.

It's not from Gabi, 'cause she's not sleeping with anybody else.
And she's not like that.

- She's not some girl gone wild.

Oh, my God.

[gasps] Ew, boobies!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Now, you need to know that all of this is because of the Tude.
Oh, you got that right.
She has a serious 'tude and she's gonna hear about it right now.
[door slams]
All this trouble because of one little box, ha, ha, ha... and the detergent.
[Sofia sighs] [sighs]
It just doesn't make any sense.
You're right.

- so that we can...

Why hasn't he responded to my boobs pic?

Gabi, Kendrick's gonna be here in 20 minutes.
And, uh, where is my penis picture?
I mean, you told me that Josh was gonna text me his penis pic.
[gasps] Why hasn't he sent me his penis pic?

Sofia, wait, wait... what if I haven't gotten it yet because he texted it to another woman?
Gabi, you have to stop and finish the dinner I'm making.
[sighs]
Sofia, how can I cook when Josh is sleeping with someone else?
[sighs] I told you this was how it was all gonna go down.
Yeah, which he is probably doing to another woman right now.
My God, look at you.

- Oh, yeah, feelings.

Okay?

Josh is sending penis pictures to every girl in America except for me.
Gabi,
- you know how much I care about you.

Oh, my God.

[Gabi and Josh gasp]
(Both) You're sleeping with someone else!
Okay, this is what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna give you two minutes to solve this while...
I go do some optimistic shaving.
Where on earth would you get the idea that I'm sleeping with someone else?
Oh, let's just say a picture paints a thousand words.
What do you mean, picture?

Uh, I saw you in your office taking some... lower selfies.
- Oh, my God, you saw...

I saw 'em all, Josh.

Wanna know why?

For your information,
- I sent them to a doctor.

You're dating a doctor?

I'm not dating anybody.

- What are you talking about?

- I'm very smart.

I know why my groin's so itchy.
- What?

I sent those photos to a doctor because of the rash from the STD you gave me.
- What?

It serves me right for having a punch card with someone young and irresponsible.
You're sleeping with other people while you're sleeping with me.
You're what my mother would call a hussy.
[gasps] Oh, yeah?
Well, you're what my father would call a man-hussy.
- A mussy.

Great.

Josh, your rash was my fault.
I used a cheap brand of detergent to wash your underpants.
Ask Elliot, he was itching too.
You were wearing my underpants?
No!

(Sofia) Okay.
Don't you see what is happening here?
Nobody was sleeping with anybody.
Except for you two because of that stupid punch card.
Which as I predicted didn't solve anything because you still have the same issues you had without it.
No, we don't.
Oh, okay, really?

I do not recall.
And, ah, you weren't jealous when you came barging in here accusing Gabi of sleeping around?
I do not recall.
Guys, just admit it.

Okay?

Which, I promise will be spectacular and in Barcelona!
She does kinda sorta have a point.
Yeah, I guess this is starting to feel a little... boyfriendy-girlfriendy.
What?

- should we just stop this whole...

- Well, it was fun while it lasted.

No.

Please leave.
Wait... uh, Josh, I-I-I need to tell you somethin'.
The reason I was buying cheap detergent...
Yolanda, I know why.
- You do?

I'm obviously not giving you enough money to shop with, so why don't I just double what I give you now?
I think that would be for the best.
Great.

Like you have low self-esteem.
Sofia Rodriguez?
- Yes.

Thank you.

- Aw.

"I got back with my girlfriend
"so I can't make dinner.
"But thanks for being such a good listener."
Aw.
- Oh, my God.

He sent me flowers!
[sighs]
- [line trilling] - [phone ringing] [phone ringing]
That's funny, I was just gonna call you.
Oh, well, great minds think alike.
So, um, here's what my mind was thinking.
It's not that we can't handle a punch card, it's that the punch card has a little flaw.
We forgot about rules.
Go on.
- So, we're obviously two cute people.

Who will eventually date other cute people.
I mean, why wouldn't we?
Exactly, I mean, we're not a couple.
Not... a couple.
So, we need a rule.
I like rules.
To prevent any jealous feelings, if I start dating someone, I'll let you know.
And if you start dating someone, you let me know.
And then we just, uh... we put the punch card on hold.
The tell and hold.
That is a genius rule.

I don't know, cute people are dumb.
So...
- the punch card is back on?

Back in business, baby.
As long as...
- as long as there are no feelings.

Nope.

I am so relieved.
Me too.
[chuckles]
What?

Have you seen "Raccoon with a Broom"?
- No.

- [chimes] - here it comes.
[gasps] He's sweeping'.
Oh!
Ooh!

No!

[tablet chimes]
You know, not being in a relationship is awesome.
Yeah, it's the best.
Aw!

Aw, that's so cute.

(Josh) Do they remind you of anybody?
- (Gabi) Elliot and Yolanda.

Those are boy jeans.
Why do you have boy jeans?
Oh, uh, they're Kendrick's.
I accidentally spilled your leftovers on them, so I offered to wash 'em.
Oh, no.

Is it?

God, I would hate for him to think his girlfriend gave him an STD.
Mm. [gasps]
You spilled those leftovers on purpose.
- Did I?

Phoenix!
