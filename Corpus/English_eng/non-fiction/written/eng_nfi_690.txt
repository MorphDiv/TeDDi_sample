Peter said I didn't wanna be in his head for his last days.
So don't.

Why are you on this anyway, Annie?
Because I think it's gonna help me figure out who killed Jesse.
The 911 call was March 23rd.
He declared the case inactive March 25th.
He found something that made him stop looking for the killer.
And then he went crazy, spent all his time at his fishing cabin
and that was it.
What happened between declaring the case inactive and his death?
