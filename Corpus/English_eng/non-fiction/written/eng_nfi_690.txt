ADULT ADAM:

Forme,it wasmy dad'sbrotherMarvin.
Hehadamillionjobs , alwaysannoyedmy dad whenhecameover toThanksgiving...
Go away!
...andcould sweet-talkanyone.
(GASPS)
Oh, my word!
Have I stumbled into the residence of workout goddess Jane Fonda?
Marvin, come on.

Get in here!

(BOTH LAUGH) You... (GASPS) There they are, Crockett and Tubbs.
What up, my men?

I'm not here for your money, Murman.
I'm just dropping by to see the fam.
He's right, Mur.

It's the middle of May.
Oh.

How dare you suggest that I am here for a handout?
Although, as luck would have it, I am having a spot of bad luck.
Here we go.

Tell us about your recent failures, Marvin.
Classic tale.
There I was, minding my own business in this mystical shop on the outskirts of Chinatown, when, suddenly, this ancient man popped out and asked me if I wanted to buy this rare and exotic pet.
Ooh.

Better.

And so, naturally, I handed him $6,000.
Are you nuts?

You see, these Mogwai are "super-high maintenance."
You can't get them wet, no bright lights, and if you feed them after midnight, they become these bloodthirsty monsters!
Who would buy a pet like that?

No one!

Murray, please.

It's on Adam's lunchbox.

How dare you exploit the fact that I'm a kid at heart?
This is what he's talking about!

ADULT ADAM:

BestDancer intheschoolyearbook.
Barry Goldberg!

ADULT ADAM:

I'm doing business on my phone!
Vote Barry Goldberg Most Likely To Succeed!
Barry Goldberg Most Likely To Do This.
Barry Goldberg, Best Juggler.
ADULT ADAM:

Ow!

Just get in the locker!

(CHUCKLES) I won't let you down.
ADAM:

Damn it.

(GRUNTS) Wha...
'Cause I'm not a child anymore!

How do you not see it by now?
For your information, Best Bully isn't something in the yearbook.
How would you know?
You're just one of Adam's dumb little friends.
Actually, I'm the editor.
No way!

Let's just say you weren't recognized for any individual achievement.
Damn it!

(IN SING-SONG VOICE) Guess who got Best Substitute Teacher?
The guy with the bat from Lean on Me?
It's your mom, dude.

(BEVERLY CHUCKLES) Bye, Adam.
Later, babe.

The yearbook must be stopped.
Not being recognized for my awesomeness is the greatest injustice this world has ever seen.
You should get kindest eyes.
And you should get Rightest Guy 'cause you're right!
That's not an equal compliment, but I'll take it.
Okay, I probably shouldn't be saying this out loud, but the only thing I want in the world is to get Cutest Couple with Erica.
Geoff, it's just a lame yearbook.

Especially 'cause we're a lock, so why obsess over it?
A lock?

Like who?

Mmm-hmm.

Except half your couple is Barry, so... (VOCALIZES)
Hate to be this guy, but I think everyone's kinda over the whole Erica and Geoff thing.
Yeah, Barry and Lainey may not be the fresh new couple, but you can't help but root for them.
Ha!

Damn it, I need this win!

Just go ask Adam.

Since when?

You mean Dana?

You mean punch him until we get what we want, right?
ADULT ADAM:

God!

I can't let you leave empty handed.
I made you three casseroles and a Jell-O ring.
(CHUCKLES) You're always so good to me.
Marvin.

All right, here's the cold hard truth.
You know all that stuff I was saying about the Mogwais?
It's not real.

It's made by Steven Spielberg.

It's surprisingly scary.

Starring Phoebe Cates.

Please, let me help you.
Okay, here's the deal.

Keno?

That's why I thought I had an edge!

You know, instead of coming to Murray asking for money, why don't you ask him for a job at the furniture store?
Oh, man, if you get me this job,
I will never ask you for anything again.
If you're serious,
I will do everything in my power to get you a job.
Absolutely not!

You don't have to convince anyone, Marvin.

Look, Barry already worked here, and it was a disaster.
I'm not hiring another child from this family.
Pfft.

Well, I'm still a partner, and I can hire and fire whoever I want.
Marvin, you're hired.

And I can do this.

You're hired again.

You're fired.

You're hired back.

I'm gonna give it my all.

(BLEEP) You're hired again.
Yes!

No!

Well, that was a roller-coaster ride.

It's settled.

ADULT ADAM:

Meanwhile,myoldersiblings cametome foralittle politeconversation.
Hey!

Okay, it was six.

I need you to change the yearbook so I get Most Handsome or Most Likely To Jump A BMX Over The Grand Canyon!
No.

Yeah, I'm not gonna do any of that.
Hold him down and I'll beat him with his own toys!

Nothing you can do will hurt as much as betraying my fellow yearbook staff!
I don't care about your dumb baby club!
This is a very serious real, adult problem!
Now tell me if Geoff and I got Raddest Couple!

I tell you nothing and you put some Magic Shell on some ice cream for me.
(SIGHS) Why is he making delicious demands instead of cowering in fear?
'Cause for the first time ever, I have absolute power.
I not only know what's in the yearbook, but I can rewrite it as I please.
You're bluffing.

Or maybe I make you Most Likely To Share An Apartment With Her Mother.
That's my nightmare!

No!

I'm just getting started, Most Likely To Lose A Freestyle Rap Competition.
Don't you dare put that in.

No!

He's attacking my private insecurities!
I have extensive demands.

I might be inclined to let you sneak a peek at the yearbook.
ERICA:

Buy you scratch 'n sniff stickers?
ADAM:

I've waited my whole life for this moment and it's finally here.
I'm no longer your nerdy little brother.

Just let me kick him!

He owns us.
Barry, do me a favor and scratch this for me?
My finger grows weary.

Suit yourself, Most Likely To Never Dunk On A Regulation Basket.
(SNIFFS DEEPLY)
ADULT ADAM:

(LAUGHS) Don't sweat it, Mur.

I literally have never been able to count on you.
So I'm due!

All you have to do is teach me everything you know, starting now.

Lamp.

All right.

Couch.

Coffee table.

Couch.

Table.

Chair again.

Couch.

Couch!

I know what you know now!

Let the sales begin!
ADULT ADAM:

Is this a clock-in, clock-out situation, or am I on salary?
Doesn't matter!

Let's sell some extra-size chairs!
Couch!

ADULT ADAM:

ADULT ADAM:

EricaandBarryhad nochoice buttogiveintomy list ofridiculousdemands.
Okay, they were out of grape scratch 'n sniff stickers, so I got hamburger, pizza, and skunk.
Skunk?

That's the one scratch no one wants to sniff!

Oh, no!
Do you think Jedi Master Adam Skywalker will be displeased?
He's not here, you don't have to call him that!
I got to get in the habit.
If I screw up, who knows what he'll label me in the yearbook?
This is crazy!

He's been on the computer all day proofreading the yearbook.
Let's just go in and swipe the stupid floppy disk.
Oh, no.

We gotta think of a brilliant, complex plan to lure him away from it.
ADULT ADAM:

Yo, Jedi Master?
Number three on your list is to inform you of any pertinent TV marathons, and there's a whole block of ALF on.
Yes!

ADULT ADAM:

Here we go.

Son of a bitch!

They gave it to the head cheerleader and our handsome quarterback!
What kind of backwards school do we go to?
Screw that.

It's a weird time to forget my name, but do it for us, baby.
No way!

Stop it!

You stop it!

Stop it!

Stop!

Lai...

Everyone, come on!
I want Barry and Lainey Best Couple!

Are you kidding me?
(GASPS) It's Jedi Master Adam!
How dare you use ALF'sgoodname to distract me?
ALFissacred!
He eats cats, dude.

Doesn't matter!

You left us no choice, man.
We've been working our fingers to the bone to make you happy!
Just let me make one little change.
Never!

We need it!

ADULT ADAM:

(IN SLOW-MOTION) No!
Barryaccidentallygrazed theinsideof thedisk.
Yep,backthen, afragilefloppycouldbe ruinedwithonetinytouch.
Oh, no.

No.

I saw it.

My fingers missed the tender insides!

The tender insides are still gonna be okay.

ADULT ADAM:

Surely,a fingerprint couldn'tcause thatmuchdamage.
Andyet,it did.
He touched the tender insides.
I didn't think I touched it.
So, now that we're starting fresh, may I suggest Geoff and Erica for cutest couple?
(BARRY SIGHS) Too soon?
ADULT ADAM:

What the hell is this?
This, my dear brother, is our future.
I give you...

I don't want any bean bags!
Take them back to where they come from.
Please, just hear me out.
Do you remember last year when I went back to college for a week?
Yeah, I paid for the whole semester.
Well, before I was unfairly kicked out of the freshman dorm for that fire,
I learned that every kid comes with two things...
A mini-fridge and bean bag chairs.
Marvin!

We sell furniture!
Um, bean bag chairs are furniture.
They're soft, colorful balls of furniture.
How are you not getting this?
Damn it, Marvin!

Yes, they will!

I will never sit on a bag of beans.
Sit on the beans.

No!

Stop it!

Ease on down to comfy town.

(GRUNTS) Yes.
Now let the tiny beans work their magic.
Damn it!

The more I push, the more I sink!
(CHUCKLES) You're doing it wrong.

Like me.

(STRAINING) You just got to do like I do.
(SCREAMS)
Now I'm stuck in this horrible cloud of beans!
I knew this was a bad idea!

You were supposed to take this seriously!
I do!
But if you don't appreciate me, then I'm gonna quit.
More like you're fired!

Yeah, don't bother.

(GRUNTING WILDLY)
Seriously?
The whole yearbook's gone?

Well, as you know, these two treat me like a child, so I composed a list of demands for when the balance of power shifted in my favor.
What are you even talking about?
Do you have any idea how much time
I've spent working on this layout?
Based on the fact that this is the yearbook,
I'm gonna go with a year?
Yes.

Don't worry, Dana.
I've literally memorized the entire school year.
All I got to do is re-create the yearbook using my brain snapshots.
You mean your memories?

(INHALES DEEPLY) It was late September, Wednesday.
It was snowing hard, and the Eagles were in the Super Bowl.
None of that's right.

And we were like, "Good one, bro."
That does sound like me.

I still have the hard copy, so I'll just retype the whole thing by myself.
At least let me help.

You think this was my fault?
They told me ALFwason .
I mean, puppetry, comedy, a wisecracking alien.
Come on!

No.

Thanks a lot!

You started this when you gave us that insane list of demands.
Do you even know why I wrote it?
My whole life, you've treated me like some insignificant baby!
I couldn't wait till I got to high school so I could be an equal.
But it got worse!

Adam.

It's bad enough that you always see me as a little child, but now Jackie does, too.
I hope you're happy.
Jedi Master Adam's done with you two!
(SNORING)
Marvin?
Huh?
(LAUGHING) Oh, hey!

Bev!

I was just... (CLEARS THROAT) poppin' into the Wawa here to pick up some strawberry milk and...
And get a box of California raisins.
You gotta treat the body good if you want it to treat you good back.

Are you just saying a bunch of words to distract me from the fact that you're living in your car?
Can't a man just have all of his worldly possessions stuffed into his DeLorean?
What happened to your condo?
Funny story, sad story.
I had to sell it in order to get rid of my keno debt, which is a good thing because now I'm free and clear to start over fresh.
Fresh?

I like to think of it not as home-less but as car-full.
I'm actually thrilled this is happening, except for the bucket.
Don't look in the bucket.
Okay, you're coming home with me.
You can stay in the basement until you get back on your feet.
Yeah, I don't know if the Mur-Man's gonna be cool with that.
Marvin, he loves you dearly.
He may act all angry, but deep in his heart, he wants you to live with us.
I do not want him living with us!
I am saying it out loud so everyone can hear!
He's got to go!

Think you're right, Bev.
He's playing it super angry, but he wants this.
Ha-ha!

Now I got four kids living here forever and leeching off me.
That's it!
I am tired of you always calling me your idiot kid brother!
Just once, I want you to treat me like Barry and Erica treat Adam, with a little bit of dignity and respect!
The timing of this comparison is not good.
That's why I'm a damaged shell of a man, Murray, because you never looked at me like I was your equal, unlike these two angels who build up their kid brother no matter what!
Oh, my God.

We got to fix this.
You see that?
There they go, off to make a growing boy's dreams come true.
Learn from them.

Don't make me out to be the bad guy here.
Right.

Good news, Murray...

ADULT ADAM:

(ENGINE SPUTTERING)
Onlyproblem...

There you go!

Uh, I don't want to sound ungrateful here, Bevvy, but you got to put your back into it!
ADULT ADAM:

Hey, big man.

Not boy.

I don't know what's happening, but make it stop.
Look, you were right.
It's not fair that we still treat you like a dumb little kid.
From now on, you're no longer our nerdy baby bro.
You're like a real person that matters.
Well, none of that helps me get Jackie back.
Lucky for you, we can help with that by doing what we do best... redeeming relationships with original song.
(FINGERS SNAP) Hit it!

Sorry about ruining your life's work.
I got to say, that was pretty well-rehearsed for how bad it was.
Was it the chorus?

Forget the song.
Fact is, if I want to be treated like an adult,
I got to act like one.
And that means taking real responsibility.
Oh, look.

What can we do to help?
How are your typing skills?
Done!

The yearbook...

How is that even possible?
First, I got my brother and sister to help.
Then we got all our closest friends to retype it page by page.
You did that for me?

And then I read it, and it was a giant mess.
So I took the disk that we destroyed to a computer expert and spent all my Bar Mitzvah money to fix the tender insides of the floppy.
Gotta say, I'm impressed.
I did make one change, though.
I made us Cutest Couple.
That's a blatant abuse of power.
And I'm good with it.

ADULT ADAM:

Andmydadrealizedthat , despiteeverything, hislittlebrother hadactuallycomealong way.
¶Ooh,ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey.
¶Ooh-ooh
Go away.

Here's a key.
What's that?
You're moving in.
Well, I thought you didn't want another kid leeching off of you.
You're not a kid.

And you won't be leeching, 'cause you're paying rent.
How?

Yeah, you do.

Why?

It's time we both started believing in you.
¶Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(VOICE BREAKING) I just messed up everything.
Maybe you did.
But it's never too late to start over.
Really?

Thanks, Mur.
ADULT ADAM:

Nomatterwhat,theyalways giveyouanotherchance.
ADAM: "I'm the Leia to your Han Solo."
Oh, sweet God.
Don't get a big head about it.
No, read what I wrote.
"I'm the Han Solo to your Leia."
That's crazy, right?

(BOTH LAUGH)
Would you look at that?

Gross.

We're kissing now.
