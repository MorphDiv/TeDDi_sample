Previously on "Wrecked"...
You'll come by my tent every night.
What's in it for me?
Obviously, there's no way that she's pregnant.
Just one more big push, Rosa.
Oh, my!
It's a baby!
Bye.
Oh!
You did it.
Okay, you're a good doctor, Dr. Florence.
No, I'm not.
I'm a bad doctor.
What are you gonna do about it?
Ahh!
Jesus, Karen!
The pirates returned our luggage.
Also, you have a boner.
Come on!
Oh, God damn it!
The cut all the nipples out of my shirts!
Hey, I cut the titties out!
What's up, dawg?
I mean, I think that's a good look.
You think that this is a good look.
I'm glad they stole your jewelry.
What is happening over there?
Are they flirting?
Hey!
Hey!
Are you friends flirting?
Oh, what?
Yes!
Babe, they didn't take my Roger by Roger Federer sweatbands.
Suckers were sitting on a gold mine, didn't even know it.
I don't get it.
Why would they give us our stuff back now?
Todd, these pirates are our last chance to get off the island.
If that boat leaves, we die here.
But I don't want to die here.
I want to die in Scottsdale.
We all do.
That's why we got to get on that boat.
Th-There is one thing.
I got to bang one of these pirates.
There is no way I'm gonna let one of these scum sacks anywhere near your smokin'-hot boobies and butt.
Okay, you think I want to do this?
In exchange for sex, we ask for two spots on the ship.
It's a classic
No, no, no, no, no, no, hell, no.
I just made peace with you and Chet.
I don't think I could handle you boning down with a pirate.
Plus, what makes you think one of these pud-knockers would even go for it?
Well, Tank Top's been flirting with me.
All I'm saying is that if we offer,
I know he'll say yes.
Except he won't be able to, 'cause I'm gonna murder him by killing him.
Look.
This is about saving our lives.
And besides, a wiener just a wiener.
I am your babe, and your babe only.
No matter what.
Fine.
But you have to wear like 10 condoms.
That's not how condoms work.
And you have to wrap a shirt around it.
No!
Oh, whew!
I bet your dead husband never gave it to you like that.
He sure didn't.
But it'll do.
So, I've been, uh,
I've been thinking a little bit about us.
I have things to do.
Things to do!
It's a Monday, isn't it?
You know, you act all tough.
But I think inside, you're actually very tender.
I'm not.
Now, if you let me in,
I bet old Steve could...
Uh, the buyer came through.
Who's the buyer?
Can you get out?
What about our conversation?
Working hard or hardly working, right?
Working hard.
So, it looks like you dawgs are tearin' out of here soon, huh?
Yeah, sucks!
Feels like we barely got to know each other.
'Cause I've got a lot of sorting to do, and I need this interaction to be over.
Well, we were just saying that, you know, it would be so great if we could just go on that boat with you and just, like, really, you know, get to know each other.
Okay.
Well, what if I have sex with you?
Reverse indecent proposal.
That's a bold move.
That's a risky move.
What makes you think I'd be interested?
Well, I mean, you've been flirting with me
Oh, my God.
She thinks everyone is flirting with her.
My friend Chuck, Tony Touch,
Bake Show, Gawler, my boy O-Ring...
Okay, O-Ring literally proposed to me.
That literally means nothing!
I want something different.
I'm talkin' about a reverse reverse indecent proposal.
So, a... decent proposal?
See, it turns out, um...
I'm quite bi-curious.
So yeah, I think I can get you on that boat, but, uh, I'm gonna want to do both of you.
Together.
This dude's crazy.
He's playing mind games with us.
What are you talking about?
You've always wanted to have a threesome.
I've always wanted to have a threesome with another girl.
Read the Bible!
Uh, why can't it be two boobs and two dongs, huh?
Todd, are you really not gonna do this?
10 minutes ago, you didn't want me to do that at all!
So you man up, and you [bleep] that pirate with me.
Jess, come on.
Hey!
This reverse reverse indecent proposal is tearing us apart!
So weird how everyone was teasing us about that we were flirting.
It's like, "What?"
We're all stuck on this island together.
It's not like we're gonna start hooking up and, like, in the bushes, just going down on each other.
That's exactly what... why I thought it was so funny.
Can I have a word with you, just the two of us?
Yeah, just... just you and I?
Um...
Okay.
Well, uh, hypothetically, if you were in a relationship with someone...
what would you do?
How well do you know each other?
You really expect us to believe that someone on this island who has met you is having sex with you?
Yes, Owen, because it's true!
so sexually, it's, uh, pretty good.
Oh, it sounds like it.
I just need some advice on the emotional front.
Okay.
Steve, whoever this is or isn't...
She probably just wants you to... tell her how you feel... so she can know if the vibe is real.
Just, I don't know, take her on a date.
Thank you, Florence.
And Owen, a bit rude standing there, just listening to our conversation.
Stupid Todd with his stupid penis!
I mean, why can't he just have a threesome?
What is the worst that could happen?
Whoa!
Hell, yeah.
Some ponging.
That thing... that's hilarious.
Yeah, I thought we could chill a little bit before we get to humping.
Sick.
Lovin' the jam-band tunes.
Wait, are those...
Roger by Roger Federer sweatbands?
Of course.
I don't hit the links without 'em.
What are we doing?
Jess, you can go.
I'm gay now.
What?
I don't love you.
I love you.
I know this is quick, but... will you gay marry me?
You gay bet I will.
Oh, God.
We can't do it.
He'll fall in love.
The hell's her problem?
I got to bang some dude?
Why can't she just do it solo?
Wow.
You deserve it.
See anything you like?
No.
What?
What if I just go down on you for like a few hours?
Well, your boyfriend already turned me down, and if you don't have sex with me,
I'll kill both of you.
I don't care.
I want Todd and Todd only.
Even if it kills us.
Aah!
I am... furious!
I will kill everyone!
Oh, God.
I've got to be there.
She loves me too much.
Todd!
Todd!
Jess!
Todd!
No, you were right.
We have to have a threesome.
I let you go in there alone, you'll get us both killed.
Let's go bang a pirate.
Where are you taking me?
I thought you said there was an emergency.
It's a picnic emergency.
I don't have time for this right now, Steve.
I'm very busy.
Five minutes.
Maybe seven.
Okay.
So, unfortunately,
I don't have any real picnic food because we're stuck on a deserted island.
So you wrote the word "cheese" on a rock?
Fancy some wine?
Take your pants off.
Uh, actually, um, I brought you here because I want us to talk.
Um, get to know each other.
I'll go first.
So, something you don't know about me is I used to be married.
Okay?
And my ex... she cheated on me.
She used me.
And I swore I would never let it happen again, no matter how piping' hot the sex was.
You don't want to have sex anymore.
Please.
I'm just trying to get you to let me in.
I know that deep down, underneath that cool, tough pirate-girl image, you're a nice person.
You don't give up, do you, Steve?
The Barracuda!
Aah, V-Neck!
Have you heard of knocking?
Where am I supposed to knock, Steve?
What is it?
The deal's ready to be finalized.
I have to go.
Thanks for the cheese.
Hey.
Well, all right.
But we're gonna need to make some rules.
Rule number one...
You're not allowed to fall in love with each other!
Why would that even be a rule?
It is a rule!
You both have to agree to it, or no deal.
I hump you, you don't hump me.
You're sure you don't even want to try it just a little bit?
We'll play it by ear.
Final rule!
I pick the music, strictly jam bands.
No!
No jam bands!
No harmonicas, no improvising, no solos.
- "Take me to Widespread..." - noodling thingie...
Whoa, whoa whoa!
God, you guys fight a lot, huh?
So, you down to clown or what?
Does it look like I'm down to clown?
No, that's not clowning.
That's real bad miming.
My God.
You in her, and them me in her, and then we touch butts?
Or you want more of a sandwich sitch?
Show me how you normally start when you're alone.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're not gonna be slammin' anything.
We will be making love, and love is about coming together.
That's impossible.
No, I mean becoming one.
You two need to start listening to each other's bodies.
I mean really hear each other, do you know what I mean?
I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.
Todd, look at Jess.
Nope, in the eyes.
In the eyes?
Why would I...
Whoa.
Wow.
What is happening to us?
I'm getting all... goose-pimply.
Now, Jess, I'm guessing that little plank-board situation from before isn't exactly how you like to get down.
So why don't you tell Todd exactly what you want him to do to you?
Like, with words, or...?
Kiss... my neck.
Your neck?
I mean, okay.
No!
No, I-I-I liked it.
Yeah.
Now we're getting going.
Now it's Tank Top Time.
All right.
So, he says he'll give you $200,000 a pop and he'll take everyone under 50, so that leaves 29 islanders.
Tell him I said $250,000, and I want them gone tomorrow.
What about everybody else?
Kill them.
Aah!
Caught this one outside, eavesdropping.
I didn't hear anything.
I've actually got an ear infection, so...
I've decided Steve will be coming with us.
Wow!
I never felt so close to you.
I never felt so close to you.
Whoo!
Yeah.
Whoo!
Yeah, I feel like we really got into a nice rhythm there, you know?
She's about to round up all your friends and cut out their organs, sell 'em on the black market.
Come again?
I tell you what, you guys are precious capital.
You'll have to kill everyone.
Yeah, but you know what?
You guys don't worry, 'cause you're good.
You're gonna be on that boat with me.
And every day is gonna be Tank Top Time.
Whoo!
Tank Top Time!
Todd.
Todd, we have to tell everyone!
Okay, yeah, that's great, but let's just think this through.
But if we tell everyone what's going on, we'll lose our place on the ship.
That means we just had a threesome with a pirate named Tank Top for nothing!
He was putting his fingers in me,
Even if we die, what we just did in there was not for nothing.
It was for us.
I love you so much.
Okay, but we should wash our hands first.
Hurry up.
So I broke these two fingers punching him right in the chin, and that's how I got thrown off the set of "La Bamba."
There you are!
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Okay, hi.
I was hanging out with Florence.
I see.
Is there anything you'd like to say to me?
No.
Uh, I think, you know, that we might kind of be into each other, but, uh, I'm not really sure 'cause we haven't even really talked about it.
Okay, dude.
Do not do this, all right?
First you're gonna hook up, then you're gonna break up, and then you're gonna be stuck together here on the island.
Well... that's what she said.
I don't get it.
Get what?
No, that's literally what she said.
Okay, I don't think you understand how the joke works.
No, I'm not doing the joke.
Yeah, but usually, you have to do it in, like, a reference to a sexual thing,
We got to get our shit!
We got to get our shit, we got to get out of here!
The pirates... they're gonna harvest our organs and sell them.
Wait, how did you guys find this out?
Because we just had...
The pirates... they're gonna kill us!
Oh.
Steve, man.
If it means that much to you, you can come back in.
We'll pretend we didn't know.
It's not that!
I thought The Barracuda was a good person.
I've been sleeping with a monster!
What?
Steve... this Steve... has been banging The Barracuda!
There are more important issues at hand here!
Like the fact that our kidneys are about to be ripped out of our asses!
Guys, what are we gonna do?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We're all gonna die!
