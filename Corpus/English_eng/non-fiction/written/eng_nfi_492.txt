(Peaceful guitar music)
(Footsteps resounding)
(High-pitched peep)
(Door slams)
(Buzz, clanking handle)
(Buzz)
(Rattling the door handle)
(Buzz)
(Buzz)
(Distant echoing thudding)
Hello?
(She presses the door handle)
(Phone ringing)
Hello?
(Woman:) Hello?
(Man's voice:) This is Jens Kaufmann.
(Theme music)
(Gentle guitar music)
I always thought we were safe here.
Suddenly you realize nowhere is safe.
It's terrifying that someone took a picture of Leon here.
We were here and it still happened.
(Hanna:) And instead of believing and helping you, they suspect you!
Are they allowed to do that?
What will they do if they decide you're guilty?
I don't know what to do.
- (Hanna:) Shit!

Everything will be fine, I promise.
- Hanna!

What are you doing?
- Fixing the vase.

(Suspenseful music)
(Car engine starting)
(Train driver:) Please use all available doors.
(Train driver:) All aboard.
(Train driver:) Doors closing.
(Phone alert)
(Lukas:) A ticket to Frankfurt.
(Man:) "Justitia in suo cuique tribuendo cernitur."
"Justice is recognized by the fact that it renders everyone his or her due." Thank you very much.
(Students applaud)
You cannot be serious.
- Thomas...

(Lukas:) We used to make fun of people who rotted in their offices.
People can change.

(Lukas:) Dalton gave me the hacker's contact.
The guy is dead.
(Lukas:) You think someone would set themself on fire and jump out a window?
I wouldn't be bothering you but it's getting worse.
I got a warning from the police.
I'm on video allegedly buying chemicals in a supply store.
But I've never been there.

Here...

Look for evidence.

- I've done it for you more than once.

Just one more time.
- Thomas, please.

(Lukas:) Leon's good.
Fuck it.
(Footsteps)
(Quiet music in background)
(Vero:) You think someone can watch us through that?
They can.

I'll do it too.

Knock, knock.
- Bonjour.

One moment.
- We can sit over there.

- I wouldn't mind you watching through my camera.

(Giggles)
- Let's get started?

We agreed on black and white sketches but I already have a layout for Wizzy with bright, cheerful colors.
Let me show you...
The children should have fun and not realize they're learning.
Right?
- Yes.

That's it?
This is all you managed to come up with?
It's even more than what we agreed on.
I think it's good.
Good.
I don't want 'good', Hanna.
I want the best.
- I wonder if you want the best.

Then show me you're better than this.
I don't know you, Hanna.
You see...

- You might feel a little stressed.

I can do better.
Well we agree then.
(Breathing) (Lukas:) Come on.
That's him.
Fuck!

(Elevator pings)
- (Katja:) Everything okay?

(Elevator doors close)
(Boss:) You look a little tired.

- No problems.

If the police showed up this morning and searched our computers, would that be a problem?
Police?
Yes, you should have seen it.

You've earned a vacation.
- I can't take a vacation.

You got the job, Katja.

Huh?
Maybe you'll get lucky, she might need an assistant.
Come on.
What?
It's fine.
(Phone ringing)
(Breathing heavily)
(Deep sigh)
(Phone ringing)
(Lukas:) Unknown number.
Franke.

Hanna?
Hello?
(Loud church bells)
(Electronic music)
(Phone ringing)
(Camera shutter release)
- (Man's voice:) Hello, Lukas.

Imagine that I'm God.

I can get very unpleasant.
Take that package to Frankfurt.

GPS data will follow.

You don't tell me when it's over, you bastard.
Because it's already over.
Leave my family alone and get out of my life, you got it?
Stay on the line.

(Camera shutter release)
(Threatening music)
(Whispering:) I hate this.
This is the last time.
We checked Franke's accounts.
They're all regular transactions.
Insurance, day-care, oil and mortgage.

We secured the electronics, and we got the footage of him buying the chemicals.
Now then...

Why would Franke go out and buy chemicals when the hotel is full of cleaning supplies?
(She inhales, exhales wheezing)
Sandra, you're wheezing.
I'm always ahead of my asthma by a pack of cigarettes.
Okay...

Enough explosive power to destroy a whole block?
Would you just shut up for a second?
I'm sharing my ideas, like people do in a team.
I like to think alone.
(Woman:) Where are these chemicals right now?
Do you know?
I don't know.

- How's the little one?

So, your contact lens solution.
- Some candy for your boy.

And the Pranodan for your husband.

PRANODAN PSYCHOACTIVE MEDICATION
- (Hanna:) This isn't ours.

You're sure?
Absolutely.
FRANKE ...

You think after 10 years I'd take these again and not tell you?
(Lukas:) Oh, man!
Do I look like I need them?
(Hanna:) Why are you so offended?

(Lukas:) Then what is the point?
(Hanna:) I don't want us hiding things from each other.
- We don't.

(Hanna:) The package.

And this Julia...
- You're starting again?

I don't get random photos of guys' nude asses, remember?
Don't you understand none of this is real?
- You don't trust me.

Is that woman real?
Yes, I guess she is real.
But I don't know her.
What is happening to us?
Whatever happens, however it looks, you have to trust me.
We are real.

Nothing else.
(She sighs)
(Engine starting)
(Train driver:) Please use all available doors.
- Want me to take that?

(Hanna:) I'll get the shirt and you get the pencils, alright?
- I thought we'd do it together.

- (Lukas:) Leon, wait.

Don't run away.

- (Woman:) Yes.

Do you want a balloon maybe help you blend in?
Leon?
Leon?

Leon?
Leon?
Leon!
Leon!
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Leon?
Daddy, I got a present for you.
- Put it down right now.

- (Lukas:) Who gave it to you?

- A man?

What did he look like?
(Phone alert) (Leon:) I don't know.
(Lukas:) Coordinates?
It was your birthday.

Listen.

- Not all people are nice.

I told you many times not to go anywhere.
(Leon:) Okay.
- (Hanna:) There you are!

- (Lukas:) Let's go, please!

- A present for me.

- The hacker.

- He tried yesterday.

- He wants me to bring it to Frankfurt.

Here.

- Take Leon home, okay?

Bye.
(Hanna:) Come, Leon.

Miss Jansen, please.
(Phone alert)
What are you doing at the police?

Fuck you!
(Phone ringing)
TAKE VIDEO CALL
(Phone vibrates)
Hey.

Hey.

- What's up?

- It was you who called.

I didn't call you.
(Hanna:) Lukas?
- (Lukas:) Hanna?

Someone's targeting you.

(Lukas:) Please, someone's targeting you.
Get down!
(Lukas:) Right now!

- (Hanna:) Come on.

- Let's go!

Fuck!
- Where?

(Coughs)
(Clears throat)
So, Mr. Franke...
- There was a laser on you.

(Lukas:) Stay away from the windows till the police arrive, okay?
(Hanna:) Lukas...
It's about this damn package.
I'll do what he wants.

I love you.
Why didn't you stay at the police station?
You'd have saved yourself a lot of trouble.
- Your family ever deal with a sniper?

Isn't that story a little absurd?
(Lukas:) I thought it was the job of the BND...
To find out if it's absurd or not.
So did you notice the red point?
No.

My husband saw it on his cell.
(Siebert:) We get this kind of thing a lot.
Probably some kids screwing around with laser pointers.
(Sighs)
Of course, for your safety, we'll check it out.
No worries at all.
Maybe it didn't happen at all.
Sometimes imaginations can run wild.
With the stress.
(Forced laugh)
I feel much better now.

Just doing my job.
Good, then...
I'll see you out.
(Siebert:) I can find my way.
(Suspenseful music)
(Security inspector:) Once more.
(Man:) Have a good flight.
(Motorcycle engine)
The package!
So are we all set?

I did what you asked, so can I leave?
- Who sent you?

He said "Deliver the package, then it would be all over."
Let me guess.

How do you know that?
Because it happened to me.
- Give me your phone.

What for?
- Are you crazy?

- He already knows we're here.

I only want my old life back.
There, take your package.
I'm gone.
Take the package!
Don't you want to know what's in it?
(Quiet background music)
So tell me.

Mutual enemies.
I don't have any enemies.
(Woman:) I do.
I blog about politics, intelligence, industry, military.
People in the shadows.

I don't get it.
Coincidence?
Or a game?
Maybe bad luck.
(Landline phone rings)
(Ringing continues)
Yes?
(Man's voice:) See, Lena?

- (Lena:) Let's go.

(Lena:) He said we've accomplished our task.
I hope I never see you again.
Agreed.
(Hanna:) Next time a stranger talks to you you can only respond if he knows the code word.
What's a code word, Mom?
A code word's a secret word known only to friends.
- And Daddy and you.

Want to choose one?
- Johnny always calls me Robbie.

Okay.

- Robbie.

So one more sleepy time, then it's your big day.
(Leon:) Robbie.
(Truck thunders over cobbles)
(Lukas:) Sorry about your phone.

(Engine starting)
(Peaceful music)
(Felt pen scribbling)
(Phone vibrating)
- Hello?

I delivered it.

Oh, Lukas.

- My old phone was broken. - (Woman:) Please put your phone in the basket.
My plane leaves soon.

Will you be here in time?
Lukas?
(Leon:) All done!
(Hanna:) Nervous?
When will Daddy be home?
He'll see you at school.
- Good.

Arms up.
Turn around.
- Okay, done.

- (Woman:) Excuse me, sir.

Follow me.
(Whispering:) 70. 63. 56. 49.
42. 35. 28.
(Exhales long and slow)
(Phone alert)
Here we go!
Delete.
(Suspenseful music starts)
(Breathing heavily)
Shit.
(Breathing loudly) 70. 63. 56.
49.
No.

No, no!
(Moaning)
(Sobbing)
(Elevator ping)
(Panting)
(Panting, moaning)
Fuck.
(Woman:) We welcome to our podium Mike Heinz.
Next up will be Lisa Schulz.
Now we'd like to welcome Leon Franke.
(Woman:) Next to the podium Sven Lehmann.
No, this seat is taken.
(Hanna:) I said this seat is taken.
I'm Julia.
(Muted:) Your husband and I slept together.
(Dark electronic music)
