Ah, flarg!

Don't just stand there like a stump!

I am Groot!
What do you mean you used it up wrapping birthday presents for your family?
They're still a bunch of twigs!
Perhaps I can help, Rocket.
Whoa!

Sorry.

If you really wanna be useful, get me some krutackin' duct tape!
I am Groot.
This ship is much smaller than I remembered, Gamora.
Not surprising.

There was much spitting up and changing of diapers.
Oh, don't remind me, Drax.

So, Adam, I've been meaning to ask.
What have you been up to since the last time we saw you?
I traversed the galaxy, Peter Quill, seeking meaning and purpose.
At first, all I could see was chaos.
But then I think I found my true path.
This I gotta hear.
I have been purging the galaxy of darkness by absorbing villains and evildoers into my cosmic gem.
When I am finished, only the light of pure good will illuminate this universe.
No more bad guys?

More like stupid impossible.
All things are possible if you open your mind.
I am Groot!
Eh?

See?

Eh, hope is for suckers.
Me?

What was that?
Ehh!
Uh, guys, the giant space dragon is back.
Told ya!

MARVEL'S GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY Season 02 Episode 19 Title: "You Can't Always Get What You Want"
Fin Fang Foom?

He has clearly come seeking vengeance.
Although for what, I cannot remember.
Whatever it was, it's probably Rocket's fault.
Oh, yeah, that's right.

What'd I tell ya?

That's why I always pack an extra couple of these insulated force shield generators.
I'll draw him away from the ship.
Hey, big, green, and scaly!
Over here!
Okay, this is the part where you're supposed to move away from the ship.
Stop looking at me like that!
Quill, watch out for his tail!

I'll save them.

- How are we supposed to do that?

Whoa!
Groot!
Groot, speak to me, bud!
The beast is a boundless force of irrational rage.
It cannot be controlled.

Adam!
I'm all right.
It was just... the strain of absorbing such a massive creature.
Yeah.

His heart does not appear to be on fire.
At least you are all safe now.
Not all of us.
I am Groot!
There.

Now let's see what I can do for Groot.
I am Groot!
Whoa.

I am Groot?
- Interesting question.

Just 'cause Warlock gave you the cosmic fertilizer whammy don't mean he can instantly grow your entire civilization.
Actually, I believe I could.

So, should we set a course for Planet Y?
Why bother?

It's cruel to give Groot false hope when something bad's gonna come along and take it away.
I am Groot?
'Cause something bad always comes along, that's why.
All this stupid talk of hope is really starting to get under my fur!
Ugh!
Rocket, my friend, have I somehow offended you?
Look, you wanna help Groot's people?

But I got people too.

Subjects appear content in their natural environment.
Cease all violent activity!

They're good people.
Was it better when they could walk on two legs and talk to me?
Sure.

And yet I sense this is something you desire.
What if I could re-evolve your family for you?
Forget it!

It's not pity, Rocket.
I want to prove that there is such a thing as hope in this world.
Oh ho!

Please, let me help.
Fine.

- We don't tell nobody what we're doin'.

'Cause this is gonna be a total waste of time.
I know it.

If your family is half as charming as you are,
I'm looking forward to meeting them.
Yeah, they seem to like you, too, Goldie.
Really feelin' the good vibrations.
Don't give up hope, Rocket.
The universe will align, and I will make this right.
The same energy that healed Groot can evolve your family.
I know it.
Aahh!
No, Ma!

What the flarg?
Oh, great!

Oh, you again?
Oh, this just gets better and better!
Warlock, if this is a joke, I ain't laughing'!
And you won't neither when I get my paws on you!
Is it just me, or are these family get-togethers never as warm and fuzzy as I pictured?
Huh?

Wait.

That's the High Evolutionary's ship.
Which means this shindig just got upgraded from failure to total catastrophe!
Whoa.

Ugh.
What have we here?
A breathtaking work of genetic art.
Great.

That couldn't have been Warlock's plan, could it?
Ma!

Huh?

The only thing you create is a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.
You!

And why did you bring these... vermin?
What?

Ha!

What are you blathering about?
Hey, these ain't just any ordinary vermin.
They've been evolved and devolved by the greatest minds on Halfworld.
Their DNA is so complicated, no one could figure it out.
Not even you, Chrome-Dome.
Hmm.

Sort of a genetic found art piece.
But no.

And unfortunately, your DNA is of no use to me.
Not interested?

I'm out of this krutackin' gem world.
Wait.

Yeah.

Do you have any idea what it's like for an artist like me, stuck in this wasteland with this limited genetic palette?
I need color.

Not my problem.
But I do know a guy who can get us outta here, and you know the price.
Evolving your family?

Come!

Whoa!
Warlock's crazy plan might actually work!
But that'd mean he's actually right.
So...

Has anyone seen Adam?
Nope.

I am Groot!
Yeah, we know Rocket's missing.

I am Groot.

Wait.

I am Groot.
Setting a course for Halfworld.
Wait.

I'll need a massive amount of life energy to fix your family.
Unless, of course, you have an objection.
Eh, do what you gotta do.
Aahh!
Aahh!
I can't watch.

We've arrived at Halfworld.
But how will we find Warlock?
Found him!
Aaahhh!
What is he doing?
He appears to greatly dislike those rocks.
Stay back!

I absorbed Rocket, and I don't want to absorb you too!
Aaahh!
The darkness...

I cannot keep it in!
We've got to stop him before he hurts himself.
Really?

I am Groot!
No!

I am Groot?
I need more energy.
I am Groot!
- Groot!

What?

- I am Groot?

They're getting fixed by the High Evolutionary.
But I couldn't stand to watch.
Rerouting circuits.
I thought I was good enough!
I thought I could control the evil!
How could I have been so wrong?
Adam, you've got to fight it.
The evil within me is too strong!
I can feel it... the darkness!
Forgive me, my friends.
I can't control the darkness within me!
Not cool, Adam!
Everyone, fall back!
Drax the Destroyer does not fall back!
Usually.
So, you brought me another specimen.

I've been wanting to create with more of his DNA.
I am Groot!
What'd you do that for?

I am Groot!
What do you mean the gecko's pain is causing Warlock to go dark?
I am Groot!
So we stop Warlock from hurting our friends after my family gets re-evolved!
I am Groot!
It ain't fair!

I was almost starting to have hope, and now you wanna take it away?
I am Groot.
I am Groot!
I am Groot?
What?

I...

Yeah, I get it.

But I got a better idea.
If we really wanna help Goldie restore his inner balance, we gotta irritate him until he purges us from his system.
I am Groot?
Trust me, there's nothing better than a good purge.
Rodents do it all the time.
Not that'd I know anything about that!
Guys, this way!
Figures.

I am Groot!
Show-off.
- We gotta annoy him more!

Have you met my krutackin' family?
Just follow my lead.
Hey, Ma, how's about a hug for your little runt?
That's it!

Nothing worse than having wild rodents in your armpits!
Aaahhh!
The pain!

It's working!

I am Groot!
Can't hold it in!
This looks like our stop.
Rocket!

Finally, out of that accursed...
Wait.

The portrait of genetic perfection!
Forget the dragon.
I want the Warlock!
Let's move this party somewhere else.
Come on, Adam!
Go on.

There's always hope.
Especially 'cause I rigged the ship to blow up while Chrome-Dome was experimenting on my family.
Like I said, always prepare for the worst.
That's why you put erasers on pencils and escape pods on spaceships.
I am Groot.
I know that also means the bad guys got away.
With any luck, the dragon'll have 'em for breakfast.
Rocket, I'm sorry I could not help your family.
I was wrong to give you false hope.
Nah, you were right.
Not about my family, but about hope.
Just 'cause you expect the worst don't mean you can't still hope for the best.
My family may still be a bunch of feral garbage pickers, but they're good people.
And I'm gonna miss 'em when we go.
I am Groot.
What do you mean, they don't want to leave you?
They can't stay with us.

I am Groot!
This was an inspired idea, Groot.
Rocket's family will be safe and happy here among your people and the Klyntar.
Yeah, it's great... for them.
What about me?

Ma, no!

I am Groot?
Like I said, they're good people.
