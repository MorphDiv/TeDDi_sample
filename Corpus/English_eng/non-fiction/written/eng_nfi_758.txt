Run, run, run!

OFFRED:

- GUARDIAN 2:

- JUNE:

This is the new one.
I'm Commander Waterford.
May God make me truly worthy.
SERENA JOY:

Don't get any ideas.
Fertility is a gift directly from God.
You girls will serve the Leaders of the Faithful
Welcome to the friggin' loony bin.
Blessed are the meek, dear.
OFFRED:

"If my right eye offends thee, pluck it out."
OFFRED:

Maybe he watches me.
There's an Eye in your house.
Be careful.
OFFRED:

I intend to survive.
OFFRED:

I let it take me.
Blue Moon.
Rhapsody in Blue.
Tangled Up in Blue.
Blue Oyster Cult.
Blue Monday.
Our car was that color.
We bought it off Craigslist.
It smelled like maple syrup.
Luke said it was a leak in the radiator, it was probably bad for kids.
After we got it fixed, I missed that smell.
And so did Hannah.
She said it smelled like Saturdays.
(HANNAH LAUGHING)
(COUGHS)
(BED CREAKING)
I wish he'd hurry the fuck up.
(COMMANDER GRUNTS SOFTLY)
(INDISTINCT VOICES ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
(GATE CREAKS)
Hi.
Blessed be the fruit.
(INDISTINCT VOICES ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
May the Lord open.
(INDISTINCT VOICES ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
We should go.

Would you like to take the long way?
You're going to get caught in the rain.
I like the rain.
Okay, whatever.
We're going home.
- Under His eye.

Do you think it's safe to talk here?
If we're careful.
Are you from here?
Brookline.

Missoula, Montana, if you can believe that.
I moved here for school.
Do you work in the city?

OFFRED:

After my daughter Hannah was born, it was part-time but sometimes it was just paperwork.
But we did novels and academic titles.
Once we did nine volumes on the history of falconry.
Oh, man.
Actually, that sounds like it'd be fun to me right now.
Yeah, it kind of sounds amazing.
OFGLEN:

Lecturer in cellular biology.
OFFRED:

I thought all the college professors were sent to The Colonies or...
I have two good ovaries.
So they were kind enough to overlook my sinful past.
Lucky me.
(BUILDING CREAKING)
(THUDDING)
(DRILLING)
OFFRED:

That was my dad's parish.
My daughter was baptized there.
They took down St. Patrick's in New York City.
Blew it up and dumped every stone in the Hudson River.
They fucking erased it.
(THUDDING AND RUMBLING)
And how do you know that?
How do you know there's an Eye in my house?
(MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY)
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
It's okay.
To be relieved it wasn't you.
It was someone.
I know.
There's a way to help them.
You can join us.
What do you mean "us"?
There's a network.
I don't know.

No one is until they have to be.
Waterford is important.

You should find out and tell us.
- Find out what?

- Don't say a word.

OFFRED:

It seems imagined, like secrets in the fifth grade.
People with mysterious histories and dark linkages.
It doesn't seem as if it should be the true shape of the world.
That's a hangover from an extinct reality.
Now, the Guardians of the Faithful and American soldiers still fight with tanks in the remains of Chicago.
Now, Anchorage is the capital of what's left of the United States, and the flag that flies over that city has only two stars.
Now, darkness and secrets are everywhere.
Now, there has to be an "us."
Because, now, there is a "them."
Get caught in the rain?
Yes.
You were gone a while.
Sometimes we walk home along by the river.
You need to be careful.
By the river?
With her.

She's my partner.

Don't get too close to her.

He wants to see you.
Who?
The Commander.
Tonight, in his office.
Why?
9:00.

OFFRED:

We aren't concubines.

Maybe he knows about Ofglen.
Have I been invited to my own ending?
No.
'Cause it isn't an invitation.
I can't send my regrets.
(BIRTHMOBILE SIREN BLARING)
RITA:

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
(SIREN CONTINUES WAILING)
RITA:

Hurry.

I've got it.
Thank you.
I'll pray for good news.
(INDISTINCT VOICES ON WALKIE-TALKIE)
HANDMAID 1:

HANDMAID 2:

It's wonderful, isn't it?

Who is it?
Ofwarren.

OFFRED:

What will she give birth to?
An Unbaby, with a pinhead or a snout like a dog's or no heart?
The chances for a healthy birth are one in five, if you can get pregnant at all.
(POP MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)
(PANTING)
You all right?
- Fuck!

We're almost there.
(GROANS)
Okay, here we are.
(MUTTERING PRAYERS)
(POLICE SIREN WAILING)
(MURMURING CONTINUES)
LUKE:

Hi.

(SIREN BLARING)
(BIRTHMOBILE SIREN BLARING)
(HANDMAIDS MURMURING)

There's real coffee, can you smell it?
We do the work and then they pig out.

WIFE 1:

WIVES:

Breathe.
HANDMAIDS:

AUNT LYDIA:

OFFRED:

Something primal.
It's the smell of dens.
- HANDMAIDS:

It's the smell of the plaid blanket on the bed.
Where the cat gave birth, once, before she was spayed.
ALL:

OFFRED:

ALL:

ALL:

Breathe, breathe, breathe.
And hold, hold, hold.
Exhale, exhale, exhale.
- Breathe, breathe, breathe.

ALL:

You're doing great.
Hold.
ALL:

(HANNAH COOING)
Mmm.
You smell so good.
You do.
Hi, Hannah.
Hi.
Hello there.

(LUKE SNORING)
Is Daddy keeping you awake?
(SNORING)
TANIA:

- Hi.

Very good, I think.
Hey, will the doctor call me when the tests come back?
Oh, the lab just sent them up.
All normal.
Genetic screening and cardiac tests are perfect.
She is a healthy little girl.
Oh, yes, she is.

Praised be.
- JUNE:

JUNE:

Don't lose that.
- Ooh, hello.

Yes.
(SNORING)
TANIA:

Here we are, Hannah.
- Bath time.

(TANIA GIGGLES)
Where are the babies?
Oh, we had a difficult night.
Two went to the intensive care unit.
And the others are with God.
NAOMI:

WIVES:

Breathe.
Should I wash these?
MARTHA:

Just set them on the counter.
- Thanks.

WIVES:

It's so crowded up there.
At least someone spiked the juice.
You okay?
He wants to see me, alone.
Your commander?
Shit.
You don't know why?
No.
Maybe he did this with the one before you.
Maybe she told someone about it.
Let me see what I can find out.
It's too dangerous.
It'll be okay.
I'm sneaky.
SERENA JOY:

I'm just helping, Mrs. Waterford.
Well, leave it.
Come with me.
Offred, what's going on up there?
Her contractions are getting much closer together.
(SIGHS) It's taking forever.
Is it breech, dear?
Did you hear that word?
No, Ma'am.
LEAH:

Yes, Ma'am.
Would you like a cookie, dear?
CAROLINE:

LEAH:

It is a special day.
Offred, would you like a cookie?
Yes, please.
Thank you.
Here you are.
Oh, isn't she well behaved?
You can go.
CAROLINE: (SCOFFS) Little whores, all of them.
SERENA JOY:

You have to take what they hand out.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(WATER RUNNING)
ALL:

AUNT LYDIA:

- Let Him feel your devotion...

And we will be rewarded.
ALL:

Exhale, exhale, exhale.
(JANINE GROANS)
AUNT LYDIA:

You are doing so well.
- We are so proud of you.

No, I'm, uh, I'm fine.

Stretch your legs a bit.
Girls, come on, now.

Help her now.
(GROANING)
(SCREAMS)
Get her to the chair.
Tell her it's time.
(GROANS)
(HANDMAIDS WHISPERING)

Please bless us.

(BABY CRIES)
A fine and healthy girl.
(LAUGHS)
God be praised. (LAUGHS)
AUNT LYDIA:

(LAUGHTER)
AUNT LYDIA:

This is our happy, happy moment.
(COOING)
Think of what's to come for you, my girl.
(AUNT LYDIA LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)
OFFRED:

Look at me.

She's beautiful.

(LAUGHS)
Precious.

(AUNT LYDIA LAUGHS)
LEAH:

SERENA JOY:

Angela.
Angela.
WIVES:

Angela.
Angela.
Angela.
- Angela.

Angela.
Angela.
Luke?
- LUKE:

Are you hungry?

Where is she?
Did they take her for a blood test?
- Huh?

- I don't know.

(ALARM BLARING)
- WOMAN: (OVER PA) Code Yellow.

I don't know.

- Luke?

No, wait there.

(ALARM CONTINUES BLARING)
WOMAN:

Luke?
- (ALARM CONTINUES) - (PANTING)
JUNE:

- Stay here.

(ALARM CONTINUES)
Hey.

Excuse me?
What are you doing?
She's alive.
(ALARM CONTINUES)
My baby.
I told them.
She's not your baby.
Of course she is.
Isn't she beautiful?
(ALARM CONTINUES)
Luke?
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait!

She's here!

- Don't take my baby!

- No!

(HANNAH WAILING)
Stop!
It's my baby!

She's mine.

- PROTESTER: (SCREAMS) No!

Okay, she's fine.

Give her to me.
PROTESTER: (SOBBING) Don't take my baby!
- Here you are.

- Yeah, she's okay.

She's okay.
- PROTESTER:

Don't take my baby!
(SCREAMS) Please!
(WHISPERS) No one knew anything about what your Commander might want.
Sorry.
But that doesn't mean it's bad.
If he accuses you of something, don't defend yourself.

Just apologize.
They love to be forgiving.
Okay.
- Thank you for trying.

He probably just wants a blowjob.
What did he say?
When he asked to see you alone?
He didn't.

Be careful.

He said I shouldn't trust you.
He said you were dangerous.
- Really?

I mean he's right.

Especially a carpet-munching gender traitor.
(CHUCKLES)
(ANGELA WAILING)
(WAILING CONTINUES)
(WAILING CONTINUES)
MARTHA:

This little girl needs a nip.
(GROANS)
(WAILING)
MARTHA:

- Yeah, I nursed my son.

I've done it before.
(WAILING CONTINUES)
Come on.
Come on.

Come on.

(SIGHS)
Caleb used to do that when he ate.
Pull my hair like that.
(WHISPERS) Caleb's your brother.

OFFRED:

Not even Serena Joy.
What male totems are kept in there?
I guess there may be something he wants from me.
To want is to have a weakness.
That gives me hope.
But I can't stop thinking about the girl in the horror movie who goes down into the basement when the light is out.
The girl who thinks her boyfriend with the perfect hair is just playing a sexy prank.
"Justin, are you down there?"
And then she descends, with a stupid smile, to her bloody end.
That girl is a fucking moron.

OFFRED:

(EXHALES)
COMMANDER:

Sit down.
Please.
Thank you for coming.
You're welcome.
You can look at me.
We're not supposed to.
In here, we might be able to bend the rules.
Just a bit.
Hello there.
Hi.
I imagine you must find this strange.
I guess it's a little strange.
I want...

I'd like to play a game with you.
- A game?

Do you know how to play?
- Yes.

Three-eighty-six to three-eighty-three.
You're good, but I caught you at the end there.
I'm rusty.
Then we'll have to have a rematch.
All right.
I'm out of town next week, but when I get back?
I'll check my schedule.
Well.
See if you can squeeze me in.
Where are you going?
D.C.
Nothing exciting, just meetings.
Well, after you get back, then.
It's a date.
Now, I think it's time for you to go home.
Thank you for the game.
You're very welcome.
Good night.
Good night.

Our illicit journey into the world of triple word scores?
Does he care?
I think he does.
Ofglen.
I can tell her that the Commander is going to Washington.
Will she be surprised by the Scrabble game?
She'll be glad I let him win.

She'll be proud of me for that.
