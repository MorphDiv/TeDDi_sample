[DJ scratching records]
Welcome back to Clash of the Cupcakes.
Thank you, DJ Sweet Treats.
Right now, I have to share some rather unpleasant news.
Uh, we were supposed to have some very special guest judges today, specifically five of them, the legendary dance crew Jabbawockeez.
But, uh, I got here today, and I didn't see 'em.
[audience groaning]
Hey!
I don't want to hear that.
They were supposed to be here.
I don't know what happened.
[exhilarating dance music playing] [audience gasps] [cheers and applause]

[cheers and applause]
Give it up for the Jabbawockeez!
We'll be right back with more Clash of the Cupcakes.
[record scratching] [funky upbeat music playing]
[sighs]
Hey, Dev.
Uh, great job, man, great job.
Uh, we got a small issue on the last segment, though.
What's up, Lawrence?
So the Jabbawockeez, they don't take their masks off.
They need to take the masks off, right?
They gotta taste the cupcakes.
Like, somebody should have read that beforehand.
Yeah, somebody, you.
You're the producer that booked 'em.
Ah, damn.
For real?
We gonna play the blame game?
Maybe what we should be doing is putting our big boy pants on to figure out a solution.
All right, Lawrence, what if, you know, some of the guys are dancing in the front and then one of the Wockeez just dips behind the table and eats the cupcakes there?
See what happens when we have teamwork, when we work together?
That was just my idea.
Oh, oh.
So we're just going right back to being childish, huh?
I'm just gonna go let the Wockeez know our idea.
[sighs] Jesus.
Hey, Dev.
Hey, what's up, Lisa?
Just coming in for a quick touch-up.
Sure.
So you're Indian, right?
Yes.
Well, I'm friends with this Indian guy
I think you might know.
Come on, you're not gonna do that shit, are you, Lisa?
You don't go up to white people and go, "Hey, you're white, right?
All right, I do know him.
That's the only time in history that hasn't been racist.
Uh, Dev, um, one more thing.
When we sign off, make sure you go,
"Thank you to the Jabbawockeez for blessing the stage."
No, I'm not saying that.
And when you say it, make sure you put a little pizzazz in it.
Why didn't anyone read the contract?
I did read the contract.
I skimmed it.
I didn't skim too well.
I missed a couple of things.
You're stressing me out.
You really need to floss while we're doing our tapings?
That shit like termites for your teeth.
Motherfucker don't even want me to floss.

The competition is over, and it's time for these cupcakes to clash.
What will be the judges' cupcake conclusion?
Wockeez, it's time for the taste tests.

The Jabbawockeez have a very strict don't-take-their-masks-off policy, hence the dance routine instead of a traditional taste.

I don't know if it's a secret identity issue or what it is, but really doesn't seem like a big deal to me.

Jesus!
It's just us.
How'd you guys get back here?
It was really easy.
Figures.
Thank you so much for this experience.
We never thought we'd see the Wockeez so up close and personal.
You know we're huge Wockee heads.
Can we go meet them now?
Yeah, sure.
Did you guys rehearse that?
Hey, guys, I-I had some friends that just wanted to say hello if that's cool.
Oh, my God.
It's Joe "Punkee" Larot,
Rynan "Kid Rainen" Paguio,
Phil "Swagger Boy" Tayag.
How do you know who's who?
I can tell by their movements.
You guys, that might have been your best performance since your dance with Taylor Swift at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards.
Yeah, it was even better than your routine with Shaq at the 2009 All-Star Game.
And by the way, I'm Arnold, and this is Brian.
And we know it's against Wockee code to talk, but we just wanted to come give you a quick Jabba bow to pay our respects.
All right, what the fuck?
Okay, that's good, guys.
I'm sure the Wockeez have somewhere to go dance.
Take care, guys.
Did I seem cool around them?
Dude, you did so great.
[Brian sighs]
Thanks for hooking us up, man.
Hey, do you want to grab dinner later?
Wait, the Jeff Pastore, the TV guy, Chef Jeff?
He's kind of my boss.
Wow, I love Jeff's Table.
Did you ever see that Vietnam episode?
It was pho-nomenal.
[laughter]
Did anyone ever say that before?
I've never heard it.
What are you guys doing now?
Um, some friends of mine from Italy are in town.
We're heading up to Queens to the Kids Foot Locker.
The Wockeez are doing a little in-store blessing.
We got to get those primo seats.
Arnie, you're gonna block all these kids' views.
First come, first served.
Buona sera!
Buona sera!
[Francesca] Shah!
-[laughs] -[Dev] Hi.
I can't believe you're here!
Neither can I.
You're still Italian.
Yes.
How are you?
I'm good.
Where's your boyfriend, Mr. Pino?
Well, he had to work.
He's meeting some tile distributors.
So it's just me.
Well, the man loves tiles.
What do you think?
I mean, I've been walking all day through the city just staring at the building like this.
Ah!
Well, that is adorable.
I gotta tell you something, though.
I am very hungry.
Is there any way we can see the entire museum in, like, three minutes and then go get food?
[speaking Italian]
What does that mean?
If you're good, I'll give you a cookie.
[laughs]
It's not the most inspiring gig, but it's okay.
Hmm.
Can I be honest?
Shit on Clash of the Cupcakes all you want.
Okay, I don't understand why do people watch this show?
It's just a show about watching people eat cupcakes.
[Dev] I don't know.
I just host it, all right?
I say the contestants' names, and I announce the winners at the end.
Couldn't they just write it on the screen?
[Dev] They do, but I say it in a really enthusiastic way.
I want to hear that.
[scoffs] Right now?
Yes, right now.
We don't have this kind of show in Italy.
Please?
Please welcome, all the way from Cleveland,
Karen from Karen's Confections!
[laughing]
That was awful. [laughs]
[Francesca] Ah.
So this is the piece that I really wanted to see.
It's called The Dinner Party.
Cool.
Is it me or do all these look like vaginas?
[Francesca] Yeah, it's kind of like saying that all these women across history have been discriminated against just because they have vaginas.
Whoa.
Did this lady have a piano vagina?
I'm never going to a museum with you again.
[both chuckle]
Oh, how was the-- the date the other night?
It was fun.
I had a lovely evening with this woman named Priya.
I met her on, uh, one of those dating apps.
What are dating app?
It's like these apps on your phone where you see people's faces, and when you see a face you like, you hit a button, and if they hit a button on your face, then you have a match.
And then you can send each other messages and then you go out on a date.
Wow, when you say it out loud, it sounds insane.
[Francesca] No, it sounds crazy.
I had a good time with Priya.
Okay, then tell me about your night with her.
Um, well, we went to a wine bar.
Mm.
And then we went to this roof bar.
Mm.
And then we had some kissing in the cab.
Oh.
And then what?
Did you call her the day after?
I sent her a nice text message that night that said...
Oh, that's sweet.
..."Hey, Priya, thanks for a lovely evening.
I'm jealous of the lucky pillow that gets to hold your beautiful face tonight."
That's nice, right?
[groans]
If you got a text like that from a guy, you wouldn't be like, "Oh, that's sweet"?
No, I would do, like, "Ugh."
Well, Priya said, "Ugh, let's get dinner on Thursday."
I'm gonna keep looking at vaginas.
[Francesca laughs] [jazzy music playing]
Hi, um, I'm having dinner with Chef Jeff.
♪ ♪
I'm sorry it's taken so long.
And now, full disclosure.
It's my third dinner tonight.
You know, I just wandered into Shuko, say hi to my friend Nick, he's all,
"Chef, you gotta try this tuna."
Story of my life, right?
Next thing you know, I'm ten courses deep
So then I pop in to Casa Mono to have a drink with a friend, just one drink, next thing you know, I'm knee-deep in the best paella I've had all year.
Ah, well, full disclosure.
This is my first dinner, and for lunch I had a boring salad.
That's what you do.
Gentlemen, compliments of the chef, octopus pizzaiolo, beef carpaccio Piemontese, and some fresh mozz that we made here in the house.
[Jeff] Thank you, Tim.
Tim, one second.
There's something wrong with the mozzarella.
Yep, just what I thought.
What do you say you and I have a heart attack tonight, huh?
That sounds pretty fun.
I think you might really have one.
Now, a little birdie told me you spent some time in Italia.
True or false?
Uh, the little birdie was telling the truth.
I lived in Modena for a few months, learned how to make pasta.
We went there a couple years ago with Jeff's Table.
Best episode ever.
You remember that fuckin' scene--
Remember that scene where I'm sitting there with the old guy in the cafe with the hat?
I actually didn't see it.
You just seemed so fired up,
I wanted to tell you I saw it.
I'm inviting you to my next barbecue.
You better be there, you son of a bitch.
[whispers] I got him the job.
[both laugh] [punchy musical flourish]
[Dev] This is so good.
Favorite taco in New York.
Mm, Los Tacos Number 1, the al pastor.
Fuckin' kidding me, bro?
Holy shit.
Hey, pastor pals over here.
You know where I gotta take you?
El Ferron.
Have you ever gotten sexually charged from looking at a picture of al pastor?
I'm not erect, but it does look really good.
[laughs] I love your passion.
You and I, we're gonna be having a lot of food together, I have a feeling.
I'm having a going away dinner at my place.
Love to have you and a guest.
Speaking of which, I got dinner number four.
I'm meeting some people from my new charity, Jeff's Kids.
Love those kids.
Don't have a heart attack.
Timmy, can we get a check?
Oh, Chef, the meal's compliments of the house.
God damn it, you son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!
They do this all the time.
All right, tell him thanks.
Bottle of champagne there, I brought that for you.
You didn't have to do this.
Hey.
Damn.
[keys tapping]
[phone chimes] [line trilling]
Talk to me, buddy.
All right, start it off with some cocktails at PDT.
Ooh, masterful.
Hey, guys, flat or sparkling?
Uh, sparkling, please.
Uh, I'll do flat.
So how was your day?
It was good.
Um, we did a taping of Clash of the Cupcakes.
Uh, you know we had that dance crew the Jabbawockeez on earlier this week?
Who is that?
They're like these guys.
They, like, dance and have masks.
They were really good.
Cool.
Um, how about you?
How was your day?
Yeah, it was a pretty normal day.
Just meetings and whatnot.
All right.
Went with sparkling water, huh?
Yeah.
I'm more of a flat water guy.
Sometimes I'll do sparkling water with lemon.
That's fun.
I like flat water too.
I mean, they're both good.
Yeah.
They both are good.
Okay, where are we headed to next?
For dinner, I'm thinking something fun, festive:
a little barbecue.
[Arnold] You'll have that sticky sauce all over your face.
That's not a cute look.
Ooh, good point.
See, this is why we have these talks.
How about this?
Dinner at Il Buco.
[soft instrumental music playing]
So, um, should we split a few pastas?
Oh, I don't really love splitting.
I'd kind of rather just order for myself if that's okay.
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, I think I'm just gonna get the fish.
All right.
Don't ask for a bite of mine.
You can have a bite.
Um... [laughs]
Doing anything fun for the weekend?
Um, yeah, I'm going to a Rangers game.
Are you into hockey?
I know of hockey.
Um, I've never been to a game, though, or watched one on TV.
Yeah.
I grew up watching a bunch of sports with my dad.
I do not.
Thank you.
So here, I guess they just pour you flat water.
They don't even ask.
Interesting.
I like how there's no ice.
Sometimes water gets a little too cold.
Yeah, this is a good temperature.

Drinks, dinner, you got me nibbling on the bait.
Now, reel me in, Cap.
I mean, I think after dinner we should just have a nice little drink back at my place.
[Arnold] Wait a second.
A night cap with my Cap?
I told you Arnie's big toe is sensitive.
Please be careful, okay?
It's the third time I told you.
Sorry, bud.
Um, do you want to come over and have a drink?
Oh, um, you know, I think I'm just gonna grab a cab and head home.
I'm kind of tired.
But thank you again for dinner.
Yeah, that was really fun.
Yeah, it was really fun.
[sighs]
So how'd date number two with Priya go?
Every conversation was a struggle.
I don't think I'm gonna take her to that Chef Jeff dinner.
And you got no one else.
You're alone.
Yeah, but it's gonna be a fun night.
I want to take someone I'll have a good time with.
Maybe I'll take my mom.
That could be sweet.
What are you, a loser?
You can't take your mom.
There's gonna be cool people there.
And this ain't Leo at the Oscars.
You gotta bring a date.
[groans]
Every girl in my phone hates me.
What about Jennifer Lopez?
Why would that be a possibility?
Because she just broke up with her boyfriend,
Casper Smart, the dancer.
And I know her nanny.
And she probably watches Cupcakes.
I highly doubt it.
Dude, then take Priya.
I'm getting sick of this problem.
Can you come to the store with me and get a vacuum?
So we talk about your shit, but when I need a friend to give me a second opinion on a vacuum, you bail?
[sighs]
Wow, nice apartment.
Bella.
This party's so cool.
I mean, it's different than I expected.
I don't know.
Something like hamburgers and girls in bikinis?
Why did you expect that?
Well, it's America.
All your parties are like that in your commercials.

Is this not black tie?
Why would you rent a tux?
I look way overdressed.
This guy handed me his keys on the way in.
I think he thought I was a valet.
Oh, are you guys bringing out more hors d'oeuvres?
No, I'm just dressed in a tux, okay?
I gotta find the guy who gave me these keys.
You guys let me know if you hear anyone talking about owning an Audi Q4.

Fuck you, Stewart.
No, we're not in my apartment, but rather we've been transported to the hills of Achando, deep in the heart of Basque country.
