Black hole, 400-mile spaceship.
Time is moving faster at this end of the ship than the other.
How much longer, Doctor?
To survive, they are what we must all become.
Please tell me you didn't?
I have been so looking forward to meeting you.
I waited for you.
Everyone, under their beds, now!
Again?
Alit, get under your bed...

It's the scarecrows.

It's OK.

Save your ammo!
Wait for it!
Fire!
_
How many times have you died?
How many different ways?
Have you burned?
I know you've fallen.
Have you ever drowned?
Have you felt the blade?
I suppose what we're really asking, my dear, is...
Well...
Any requests?
So, I imagine you're the next one along, then?
I think so.
I'm a bit hazy on the whole regeneration thing, I'm afraid.
You mean, I'm going to turn into a woman, and you don't even remember it happening?
Oh!
- Am I a woman now?

Hold me!
- Kiss me!

Do you two want to be alone?
Which, in your case, would mean more than it usually does.
Ugh, Grandad's back.
We've been debating the best way to kill you.
Where's Bill?
Well, we thought we might chuck you off the roof, but I wasn't sure how many regenerations you had left.
Yeah, we could have been up and down the stairs all night!
We could shoot you... but that's a bit vanilla.
- But old school, nice for a change.

I said, where is Bill?
Well, if we told you that,
I'm afraid you'd be really, really upset.
So...
She's right behind you!
Look, there's Bill.
Dead, dismembered, fed through a grinder and squeezed into a Cyberman, doomed to spend an eternal afterlife as a bio-mechanical psycho-zombie... it was hilarious.
Ten years you spent up there, chatting.
You missed her by two hours!
Ripped out her heart, threw it in to a bin, and burned it all away.
He's internalising.
I love it when he's Mr Volcano.
The last time I saw you, you were on your way to Gallifrey.
Well, I didn't stay... why would I stay?
So they cured your little condition and kicked you out.
It was a mutual kicking me out.
Somehow you ended up in this dump.
You never could drive.
You wouldn't understand.
Well, let's see how I do.
Your TARDIS got stuck, you killed a lot of people, took over the city, lived like a king until they rebelled against your cruelty, and ever since then you've been hiding out, probably in disguise,
because everybody knows your stupid round face.
Round?

- It's a little bit.

Do you want to see my city, Doctor?
Do you want to see what happens when you're too late to save your little friend and everybody else?
See?
This used to be just a hospital...

The Cyber Foundries.
The whole city is a machine to turn people into Cybermen.
What do you think?

Watching the Cybermen getting started.
They always get started.
They happen everywhere there's people...
Mondas, Telos, Earth, Planet 14, Marinus.
Like sewage and smartphones and Donald Trump... some things are just inevitable.
Doctor...
Doctor, have you done something?
What's happening?
People get the Cybermen wrong... there's no evil plan, no evil genius.
Just parallel evolution.
Doctor, what have you done?
People plus technology minus humanity.
The internet, cyberspace, Cybermen.
Always read the comments, because one day they'll be an army.
Look!
They're coming!
They're coming for us!
This doesn't make any sense!
Doesn't it?
These Cybermen are primitive... they're programmed to track human beings and convert them... they home in on human life signs only.
You two, you should know by now.
When you're winning, and I'm in the room, you're missing something.
What have we missed?
You shouldn't have hit me, Missy.
I was waiting for my chance.
Computer, containing the algorithm defining human life signs...
I only had time to change one detail.
A single number.

One heart to two hearts.
I expanded the definition of humanity.
Took 'em a while to update the net...

Welcome to the menu.
Now they think that we count as humans... and they're going to fix that in a hurry!
There must be other ways up here...

You can't fight a whole city.
You know the stories... there's only ever been one way to stop that many Cybermen.
Me!
Then do it... stop them!
Begging for your life already?

I'm not begging you.

- Lucky day, then.

They're not difficult, they're Cybermen.
Knock yourself out.
Your wish is my command.
I was secretly on your side all along, you silly sausage.
Is that true?
Don't spoil the moment.
Seriously, I need to know.

It's hard to say, I...
I'm in two minds.
Fortunately, the other one's unconscious.
Nardole, have you been useful?
Yeah.

Shuttle craft.
Get junior up there.
Ooh, you hit me really hard.
You're telling me...

Right.

Agh!
Bill?
What was that, Doctor?

Yeah, I think you're right.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.

No.
The Doctor's dead.
He told me he'd always hated you.
Yeah, I heard you the first time!
- Oh, tedious!

Look, we need to get away from here, find a hole in the roof... or make one.
Is there a great big gun on the front?

I don't think we're going anywhere.
Bill's back!
Bill.
I will fix this.
I will get you back again, I swear.
What level are we on?
Must be one of the solar farms.
Hologram sky, bit of atmosphere.
Who are you?
That's the last floor we can bust through... engine's blown.
Hello, little girl.
We're from downstairs, and, er...
I think we're going to need your help.
Sorry you have to stay out here.
You'd frighten the children.
Where am I?
How did I...?
Sorry, I...
I can't remember...
The Doctor put you to sleep, you needed rest.
What am I doing in a barn?
What's wrong?
Sorry, it's just...
Sorry, what?
The Doctor has explained that you're not dangerous, but... it's difficult.
What's difficult?
Where is the Doctor?

His injuries are being tended to.
Injuries?

I want to see the Doctor!

Hello?
Hello.
Everyone's too scared to talk to you... but I'm not.
Why are they scared?
Come on, you lot, put your backs into it.
Remember the Alamo!
Oh, maybe not.
Nardole, you're working them too hard.
This isn't work, it's war.
Operation Exodus.
They're looking for fresh meat, and you're it.
Is that it?
I really wouldn't harm you, you know.
I know.
That... is not... me.
I'm sorry.
I am Bill Potts.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I am Bill Potts!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hello, Bill Potts.
Doc... tor.
I'm sorry.

Oh, no, don't be sorry.
You were being kind.
Nothing wrong with kind.

Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Bye.

What was that?

Er...
A Cyberman.
What's a Cyberman?
A technologically augmented human being, designed to survive in a hostile environment.
Perfectly sound idea... unfortunately all they want to do is to turn everyone else into Cybermen too.
They go viral.
Why?
They consider themselves to be an improvement, an upgrade.
No.
Why do I see a Cyberman in the mirror?
What do you remember?
There's quite a lot!

I was down there for ten years.
And then, one day... they took you to the conversion theatre.
- Do you remember that?

Bits of it...
You turned up.
Do you remember what they did to you?
Nothing.
Look at me.

I'm fine!
You are... so strong.
You're amazing.
Your mind has rebelled against the programming.
It's built a wall around itself...

What are you talking about?
All that time, living under the Monks... you learned to hang on to yourself.
But I'm...

Bill what you see is not you.
Your mind is acting like a perception filter.
You still see yourself as you used to be.
Used to be?
- It won't last forever...

Bill, I'm sorry, but you can't be angry any more.
A temper is a luxury you can no longer...
Why can't I?
Why can't I be angry?

Bill... please!
You left me alone for ten years, don't tell me I can't be angry!
Because of that.
That's why.
Because you're a Cyberman.
Right, everyone, back to work.
Nothing to see here, somebody broke the barn, no biggie.
Come on, defences don't build themselves.
It's OK, they're just frightened.
People are always going to be afraid of me, aren't they?
Aren't they?
What is that?

No.

Doctor!
Right, while you've been here chatting up Robo-Mop, me and... me have been busy.
We've found it.
Oh, hello, my dear.
My God, you were so boring for all those years but it was worth every day of it... for this!
Bill, don't let him upset you.
Though, didn't you used to be a woman?
I'm going to be a woman, fairly soon.

Or, maybe...

I am not upset.
Oh.

Might as well rile a fridge!

Why are there so many children in that house?
Small community, several hundred at most.
So, they keep the children together for their protection.
Those things make it up here sometimes, they try to take the children...
You all right?
Yes, fine.
What was that?
They target the children because conversion is easier with a younger donor... the brains are fresher, and because the bodies are smaller, there's less to...
Less to what?
Less to throw away.
You said...
I remember, you said you could fix this.
That you'd get me back.
Did you say that?
I did say that, yes.
- Were you lying?

Were you right?
No.
Bill?
We're not going to get out of this one, are we?
Well...
I don't know.
There are always possibilities.
I can feel it.
In my head, the programming.
The Cybermen are taking me over, piece by piece.
It's like I'm hanging on in a hurricane, and I can't hang on forever.
Bill, look, whatever it takes...
No, I want you to know, as my friend...
I don't want to live if I can't be me any more.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
And that's not possible, is it?
Well, I'll tell you what else isn't possible.
A Cyberman crying.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Come on.
Weird.
How you don't remember any of this.
The two of us together puts the timelines out of sync... you can't retain your memories, so I don't have them.
You absolutely had to bring her, did you?
"Her"?

It's a Cyberman now.
Yes, sorry.
Becoming a woman's one thing...

Where is it?
Lift shaft right here.
Hologram.
Mustn't ruin the pretty forest.
It's a wonder more people don't turn to genocide!
And the doors.
This is how we evacuate the children.
There have to be more lifts, quite close.
We know Operation Exodus is ready, we can't hang around here.
What are you doing?

You just called the lift!
Yeah, well, we're going to need them, aren't we?
The lift was downstairs... and quite possibly not empty.
Stand aside.
Do as she says.
Stand aside.
"Do as she says"!
Is the future going to be all girl?
We can only hope.
Fire!
Kill it, kill it, kill it!
Kill it, kill it.

Missy, sonic the lift, keep it here!
Why's it different?

It evolved.
Exactly.

And we just gave our position away.

It doesn't matter... we can still get out of here.
We go take the lift right to the top and escape in your TARDIS.
We could evacuate the Waltons back there, if you're feeling ridiculous.
We can't go back to the bridge.
We can only go four or five floors up at the most.
The further we move up the ship, the slower time moves for us and the faster it moves for the Cybermen.
By the time we get to the bridge, they'll have had thousands of years to work out how to stop us.
There is no safe way to get back to the TARDIS... it's a mathematical impossibility.
Operation Exodus.

Nardole, what is that?
- Tell me, what is it?

The Cybermen don't have fear but they know how to use it.
Operation Exodus.

The Cybermen are coming.
How long till they get here?
200 miles of time-dilated spaceship.
According to my calculations, we need a plan, quick.
You realise this is hopeless, don't you?
Oh, I was hoping someone would say that.
For a moment there I was feeling a glimmer of purpose.
But do we have long enough?
They're Cybermen, there's no such thing as long enough.
Nardole, look at it, they've got armour!
We don't have guns that can shoot through armour.
Look.

Dearest, I've been thinking.

We can't go up, but we can go down.
Your TARDIS is right at the bottom of the ship, isn't it?
- Well, I suppose.

What's that?
We're on a spaceship, remember?

Think you could get angry with it?
Is that windmill important?
Why?
No reason.
See that bush over there?
Shoot it.
Think you're quite something, don't you?
- I try not to miss the obvious.

Because this is not the countryside.
This is a spaceship.
- It's my TARDIS!

And it's right in the middle of a city full of Cybermen.
- They are all coming here.

Because?
If it fooled you, it will fool the Cybermen.
They're robots, but they've got monkey brains.
You can always fool a monkey brain with a little bit of theatre.
I landed here, I had trouble taking off.
The black hole?
Too close to the event horizon.
And you screwed up, you went too fast!
I blew the dematerialisation circuit.
Which reminds me, funny thing happened to me once!
What?
A very long time ago, a very scary lady threw me against a wall and made me promise to always, always carry a spare dematerialisation circuit.
I don't remember much about her now but she must have made quite an impression.
You know you basically have me to thank for this.
You're welcome.
By the way, is it wrong that I...
Yes!

I don't understand.
Well, it's very simple.
The Cybermen have removed all fear from their hearts and minds.
But you, Alit, you are going to put it all back.
I've never met anyone like you.

I don't know.

On a doorstep?
Who loved you?
I probably should tell you...

I'll try anything once.
No, stop, it's Bill, it's Bill!
I'm so sorry.
I... under... stand.
Listen...
I don't suppose...
We have a maximum of ten minutes before they attack.
Is it time?
- Nardole?

Is that my gun?
No, no.

I've got a better idea.
- Are you good at throwing?

Then how about humanity's first weapon?

Listen, me and sis are off now, but we were kind of wondering, what's your plan, Doc?
Because whatever you've got, you can't save them.
There's another solar farm, five levels above us.
If I can get all the children up there, and most of the adults...
Then the Cybermen will find them again.
It's the best I can do, so I'm doing it.
- Do you have a problem with that?

I know.

Come on, Lady Version, I honestly don't know what you see in him.
Likewise!
No.
No!
When I say no, you turn back around!

I'm going to be dead in a few hours, so before I go, let's have this out.
You and me, once and for all.
Winning?

I'm not trying to win.
I'm not doing this because I want to beat someone, or because I hate someone, or because I want to blame someone.
It's not because it's fun and God knows it's not because it's easy.
It's not even because it works, because it hardly ever does.
I do what I do, because it's right.

And above all, it's kind.
It's just that.
Just kind.
If I run away today, good people will die.
If I stand and fight, some of them might live.
Maybe not many, and maybe not for long.

But it's the best I can do, so I'm going to do it.
And I'll stand here doing it till it kills me.
You're going to die too.
Some day.
How will that be?

What would you die for?
Who I am is where I stand.
And where I stand is where I fall.
Stand with me.

Maybe we can help a little.
Why not, just at the end, just be kind?
See this face?

This is the face that didn't listen to a word you just said.
Missy.

You've changed.
I know you have, and I know what you're capable of.
Stand with me, it's all I've ever wanted.
Me too.
But no.

But thanks for trying.
Hello.
You will not be harmed.

No, thanks.
Alit, let's go!
Do you get it now?
This whole floor, under the soil, it's fuel lines and fusion turbos.
And if you happen to be a genius with insane computer skills you can remote-spark a critical failure and...
- Boom!

You weren't listening to a word of that, were you?
No, I'm still not getting it.
Incoming, about 120 feet.
On it.

So, any second now, the Cybermen will decide that we have significant weaponry.
Awesome weaponry, the ultimate apple upgrade.
Which means that they will change their campaign parameters.
How's that?
Up till now this has been a mercy mission.
A what?
They want to upgrade you.

They'll fall back, regroup, and plan a much bigger assault.
Oh, good-oh!
Yes, good.

They're moving back!
Time to go.
But we're surrounded!
I love being surrounded.

Hazran, let's get going.
Right, then, come on, you lot, everybody down to the cellar!
Nardole, I want you to lead the evacuation.
What?

There's another solar farm on floor 502, there should be enough livestock in the cryogene...
You need me with you!
Thanks for all the software, I'll take it from here.
Sir, with respect, I'm worried about your plan.
Plan, what plan?
I think as soon as this place is evacuated, you're going to blow the whole floor, killing as many Cybermen as you can.
No, course not.

- Liar, it can't be done remotely.

Neither could you.
And more to the point you are not sending me up there to babysit a load of smelly humans.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid that's exactly what I'm doing.
This is me we're talking about.
Me.

If there's more than three people in a room, I start a black market.
Send me with them,
I'll be selling their own spaceship back to them once a week.
Please, I would rather stay down here and explode.
- You go and farm the humans.

One of us has to stay down here and blow up a lot of silly tin men, and one of has to go up there and look after a lot of very scared people, day after day, for the rest of their lives, and keep them safe.
Now the question is this, Nardole, which one of us is stronger?
Damn.
My condolences.
I'm going to name a town after you.

- I'm counting on it.

Young lady, you're coming with me.
No arguments... may I remind you I am still empowered to kick your arse.
You'd have to go back down to that hospital and find it, then.
Look, Bill...
My arse got kicked a long time ago, and there's no going back.
All I've got left is returning the favour.
Oh, great.

- You sure?

I don't know what to say.
You'll think of the right words later.
Doctor.
Bill.
You're wrong, you know?

I never will be able to find the words.
Right, everyone,
I need you to be big, I need you to be brave and I need you to follow me.
Right, come on, then, hop in.

Come here.
I'm sorry?
Come here, I said.
Seriously?

I loved being you.

Oh, the way you burn.

Like a whole screaming world on fire.
I remember that feeling, and I always will.
And I will always miss it.
Now that was really very nicely done.
Thank you.
It's good to know I haven't lost my touch.
You deserve my best.
Oh, they love to advertise.
We have to keep them away from the house till everyone's clear.
We've got to buy them time.
All right, back there?

They'll attack on both sides.

Yeah.
This is it, I'm afraid.
So, if there's anything we ought to be saying...
I can't think of anything, can you?
No.
But, hey... you know how I'm usually all about women and kind of people my own age.
Yeah?
Glad you knew that!
Without hope.

Without reward.
- How long do I have?

You'll be able to make it back to your TARDIS, maybe even get a cuppa, though it might leak a little.
And then regenerate... into you.
Welcome to the sisterhood.
Missy, seriously, why?
Oh, because he's right.

It's where we've always been going, and it's happening now, today.
It's time to stand with the Doctor.
No.

Missy!

Yes, my dear, you will.
Don't bother trying to regenerate, you got the full blast.
You see, Missy.

This is our perfect ending.

OK, to the lifts... floor 502.
Squeeze as many in as you can, we only get one trip.
They'll take years to get back here.
Telos!

Voga!
Canary Wharf!
Planet 14!
Every single time, you lose!
Even on the Moon!
Hello.

Doctors... are... not... required.
I'm not a doctor.

The original, you might say.
Doctor, Doctor, let it go.
Time enough.
Pity.

I hoped there'd be stars.
They still might come, your friends.
No.

What about the Cybermen?
Well, the Doctor's destroyed most of them so it will take them a while to regroup, before they find us again.
And then what?
Well, I'm sure I'll think of something.
Nardole, Alit!

Right.

- You know Hazran?

I think she likes you.
She's only human.
Promise you won't go?
Promise.
Am I dead?
Does that feel dead to you?
You're like me now.

How did you find me?
I left you my tears, remember?
I don't think they're mine.
I know when you're crying them.

But the Doctor, we can't just leave him.
Of course we can't.

I suppose this is the only place he'd rest in peace.
If there's any place he'd do that.
How can you fly the TARDIS?
I'm the pilot.

Even you!
So I'm like you now.

I can make you human again.
It's all just atoms, you can rearrange them any way you like.
I can put you back home, you can make chips, and live your life, or you can come with me.
It's up to you, Bill.
But before you make up your mind let me show you around.
Back in time for tea?
If you want.
You know what, old man?
I'm never going to believe you're really dead.
Because one day everyone's just going to need you too much.
Until then.
It's a big universe.
But I hope I see you again.
Where there's tears, there's hope.
Just one thing, I've been through a lot since the last time we met so I'll show you around.
- Doctor!

- Doctor!

- Doctor!

- Doctor!

Doctor!
Sontarans!

I don't want to go!
When the Doctor...
When the Doctor... was me!
When the Doctor was me.
It's starting, I'm regenerating.
No!

Where have you taken me?
If you're trying to make a point, I'm not listening.
I don't want to change again.

I can't keep on being somebody else!
Wherever it is, I'm staying!
No!
I will not change.
I will not change.

No, no, no, the whole thing's ridiculous.
Hello?

- Who is that?

The Doctor.

No, dear me, no.
You may be a doctor, but I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say!
