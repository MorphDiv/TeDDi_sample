Dallas Preacher:

Forgiveness is a virtue.
Now, we are all without truth sometimes.
We are all sinners
And we are all in need of God's forgiveness, or we risk rejection at Heaven's holiest of gates.
But luckily, He is a loving and merciful God.
His forgiveness can be earned.
And you'll ask, "But, Preacher, how do I earn His forgiveness?
What can I do?"
Well, the answer's quite simple, actually.
If you put your faith in His son Jesus Christ as your lord and savior, then forgiveness is within your reach.
