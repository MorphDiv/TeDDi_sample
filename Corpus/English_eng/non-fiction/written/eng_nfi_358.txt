Ah, the Grateful Dead...
They were the chillest jam Band of the '80s, and wherever they went,
Their Die-Hard fans would follow them.
Back then, every school had the token Deadhead.
Ours was Matt Bradley.
- So talented.

- I will get by.

- JTP!

I was at the wawa, feeding that stray dog pizza.
You missed out big-time.
He loves pineapples, like a person.
- I told you, bro!

I eat those, and I'm a person.
Come on.

Actually, I think we'd rather just chill here and watch Matt Bradley jam.
- That guy?

- So?

Their songs are, like, a million hours long,
Their crazy fans smell like armpits,
And all they wear is tie-dye.
It's like, pick a color, bro.

Look past the swirly colors, man.

We should totally make him a member of the JTP.
No way!
It's in our official bylaws that any potential JTP prospect has to bring something new to the group.
Dude, he's, like, a chick magnet.
We already got one... me!
He's also, like, super-chill.
I'm super-chill!
I will physically hurt your face right now!
At the very least, he's musical.
You want music?

Attention, adoring fans...

You suck!
That's right!

JTP, drop a beat.
Um, bar, history has proven that you say two good lines
And then you freeze up and just repeat them over and over...
I said "drop a beat"!
He's stuck in a loop again.
and he's gonna get hit in the face in three, two...
*The GOLDBERGS* Season 04 Episode 17 "Dead Heads"
It was March 8th, 1980-something,
And I was doing what I did best... being awesome.
dead or alive, you're coming with me.
All right, my little Robo-Schmoop, time to clean up your masterpiece so I can lay out mine.
But we're about to shoot pops' big scene.
Adam, is that you?

Just take five, pops.
Finally!

What happened next would change my life forever.
Oh...
Fudge!
Only, I didn't say "fudge."
I said the big one, the granddaddy of bad words,
And it was not good.
Hey!

What this little muddy mouth just said.
You only get one helping of shrimp parm tonight.
You can have seconds on cheesy garlic bread, but no thirds!
It was an accident, okay?
Unacceptable!
I mean, where did you even learn such a potty word?
- Nowhere.

Who taught you how to do this stuff?
You, all right?

I learned it by watching you!
Wha... what?

I have never!
Seriously?
What?

But she did.
Bev bombs were dropped on a daily basis in our home.
Holy!

I hate drugs so much!
Adam used to be a good boy, and now he's a real.
Yeah!
Okay, maybe I do get saucy once in a blue moon, but I can because I'm an adult.
An adult who can't stop herself from talking like a lumberjack.
Oh, really?

I'm starting a swear jar.
My pickles!
You do realize that jar is way too small for you, right?
Oh, you'll see.

Oh, well, then you won't mind if we use it for something awesome, like...

Or even more exciting...
A trip to Colonial Williamsburg!
We can finally get a picture in the stocks!
You already have one!
But I want a new one.
Ohh.

No more old-timey trips where we learn stuff.
I want to tan in the Bahamas.
No one's going to the Bahamas.

Of course not.

Because my lips are squeaky-clean.
Yay!

♪♪
Yo, dude, we've been talking, and we want to make an official vote to induct Matt Bradley into the JTP.
We already decided.
He brings nothing new to the table.
Bro, he's got a snake.
A streamlined iguana?

A deal's a deal...

Fine!

All those in favor in accepting Matt Bradley as a member of the JTP, say "Aye."
- Aye.

And as we all know, I'm the leader,
So my vote counts at three.
- And what does that mean?

And what happens in the event of a tie vote?
- You win.

Yo, JTP, you meet snake Plissken?
- He poisonous?

He's a boa...

Lame.

Oh, yeah!

We took a vote.

That's not what the vote was for.
It was to be a member of the JTP.
Wow.

Don't be.

It was a landslide.
Come on, bar.

Membership test?
It's a series of riddles, trivia, and feats of strength.
Sounds rad.

I'll give you a shot.
But, as our charter states, once you fail,
You can't ever be one of us.
You don't mess around in the JTP.
- JTP!

He's not a member!
No call and response, JTP.
JTP.

As Matt Bradley was learning the rules of the JTP,
My mom was setting up her own rules.
The rules are simple...

One dollar for every swear sworn in this household.
Well, I, for one, think this is a fantastic way to make us the very best people that we can be.
And go to the Bahamas and Pierce my belly button.
- Forget I said that.

Bup-bup!

She's right, Murray.

I'm not paying for these morons to go to the Bahamas.
You know, "moron" may not be considered a curse word,
But it really does feel like one emotionally.
I'll put 20 bucks in that thing
If I can call any moron who's acting like a moron
A moron anytime I want.
50.

Morons!
You know what would teach us a super-valuable lesson?
Upping the fee for the big-time swears
To 5 bucks pop.
Yes!

Oh, balls!

that's $5!
For "balls"?

But it has so many meanings, only one of which refers to one's nards.
That's $10!
Yay!

What have you done, dragon lady?
I've got $7 to my name.

Relax.

When it comes to swearing, we have self-control.
Lucky for us, our mom does not.
Oh, my God.

I ran the numbers.

If we can up mom's swear rate to twice an hour
And nail her on some "hells" and "damn its" in between,
We're gonna be slurping on strawberry daiquiris in the Bahamas in 13 days.
How do we get her to swear more?
Follow my lead.
Hey, mom?
I've been thinking about it, and...
You're more than a mom.
You're also, like...

That's exactly how I feel!
We're like best friends!
Ohh.

While I appreciate the enthusiasm,
You kind of just dropped a big-money word.
That'll be a fiver.
Did I say ...?
I said it again!

How many... was that?
Oh, it.

It's money well-spent for my delicious, talented superstar!
Mama!

Will you hug me till I'm all roasty and toasty inside?
you are so adorable!
I'll get my purse.
As we bankrolled our trip to the Bahamas, my brother was banking on Matt Bradley failing the impossible JTP entrance exam.
Let the trials of the JTP begin.
JTP!

First up... smashball.
Let's see you hit my unhittable knuckle melon.
Yes!

Slushee chug.
No mere mortal can ingest an extra-large...
Done!
Aah!

But worth it!
Dang!

Riddles and trivia.
A body is found in a locked room...
Is the weapon an ice knife?
Damn it!
Next category...

Come up with three insults for how short Andy is.
Oh.

- Go!

When Andy plays mini-golf, it's just called "golf."
Did you hear Andy died?
He was bungee-jumping off a curb and the dental floss broke.
Ohh!

I feel completely humiliated.
This guy's awesome!
Blindfolded rubik's cube, which no human can do, which means you'll never be one of us.
Go!
Bro, this isn't in the charter.
The charter is a living document,
And, lucky for me, it makes it so he'll never be able to...
- Done!

That's awesome!
Dude!

JTP!

That means "yes." cool!
So, what are we doing this weekend?
Well, I don't know what you'll be doing,
But the o.G. JTP will be seeing the fat boys.
I'd invite you, but it's sold out.
Why don't we go see the dead?
They're playing at the fairgrounds.
Easy, new guy.
The JTP likes their music in rap form or not at all.
Actually, I wouldn't mind switching it up a bit.
Shut up, you tiny, little...
Pocket...

Damn it, that's hard.
That's a big thumbs-up on the dead, Matty.
Wait.

We could turn it into a dead bus.
Yes!

No!

And, like all other JTP decisions, we're putting this concert to a vote.
Who wants to see the fat boys tomorrow?
That's three votes for fat boys.
Why do you count as three?
'cause don't question it.
Now, how many of you want to go see that weird, lame thing I don't want to do?
One, two...
Three...
Four?
Grateful dead, it is.
You're gonna love it, JTP.
JTP!

they have four votes.
I'll never get to bulldoze my closest friends again!
This is a nightmare!
It had been a week, and my mom's little swearing problem had gone from bad to worse.
- What'd you say now?

What... did Erica get another solo?
No.

I had no choice.

Damn it!

I hate to be that person, but you said "damn it."
That's a buck.
Don't you see what the kids are doing to you?
They're using your dirty mouth against you.
It was at that moment
That my mom finally realized she was being played.
Oh, my god!

It's time I teach them a real lesson.
I've been thinking, schmoops.
This jar has been so effective at stopping my potty mouth,
I figured everyone should have a jar.
I don't know what your angle is here, but I'm gonna have to say...

Oh, sweetie, such attitude.
Luckily, now we have this.
Dollar, please.
A "baditude" jar?
That's not a thing.

Every time you lip off, it'll cost you a dollar.
Well, that's incredibly stupid!
baditude!
Now it's $2.
Just stop giving them baditude!
I don't know how not to!
This isn't fair!

Don't worry.

An "Adam" jar?
You pay up any time you say any weird stuff about space or robits or space robits.
So the Adam jar is just a nerd jar?
Yeah.

Hey, your robit-cop movie started this whole mess.
Robocop isn't a robot.
If anything, he's a cyborg, which falls under the umbrella of android,
Which means I'll put in a dollar.
See?

By the end, I'll curse less, Erica will be a ray of sunshine,
And Adam will be more...

But we don't have that kind of money.
Unless you have some way for us to steal fractions of a penny
Off every bank transaction, Ã la "superman III."
Dollar.

I can't!

It can't be stopped!
Dollar.

I'm like indy when he drank the black blood of the Kali.
I can't help myself!

Don't worry.
We'll just take money from my swear jar and put it into yours.
The proceeds from your jars
Will go towards a trip to colonial williamsburg!
You think you'll beat us?
Well, I'll be an utter delight, and Adam won't even be a little bit nerdy.
Yeah!

$5.

And so we were forced to avoid being our usual selves.
Meanwhile, pops was watching TV
As Barry forced himself to like the grateful dead.
stupid grateful dead.
I've been listening to a bass guitar solo for 20 minutes.
That's a lot of bass.
Everyone knows no song can be longer than 10 minutes unless it's the sugar hill gang.
I know what'll make you feel better... "what's happening!"
And I told you...
This kid Matt Bradley is trying to take my place as supreme and almighty leader of the JTP.
No, I'm saying "what's happening!"
I'm losing my posse!
How are you not getting this?
I get it!

I told you what's happening 10 times!
Much like my mom, who tended to swear,
This is what pops usually said.
What's happening?
What's happening?
What's happening?
What's happening?
What's happening?
What's happening?
Oh! "What's happening!"
I love rerun on these reruns.
This is a classic.
Rerun tries to bootleg a show, and then the doobie brothers stop an entire concert when they see rerun taping them.
Thanks for ruining it.
Wait a minute.

That's it!
I'll record the dead concert and get caught.
I'm gonna really ask this time... what's happening?
I'll tell you what's happening.
I'm gonna make sure the JTP never see a dead show again.
Oh, there you are.
Erica, do me a favor and empty the dishwasher.
I would love to do that, mother.
So nice of you.

What?

Fun...

My mom was playing us just like we played her, and then she pulled out the big guns.
I heard there's a new "star track" movie coming out.
We should go see it, huh?

That is s...

And I heard the best thing about the space movie is this one superhero named Hans Olo.
Run, Adam!

No!

His name is Han Solo, not Hans.
He's a rogue smuggler, not a Danish shoe cobbler.
- You boned us.

Not "Star Trek."
and it's "Trek," by the way...

Colonial williamsburg, here we come!
Oh, you're gonna look so cute with your musket.
Aha!

I knew that she wouldn't last long.

Baditude!
Huh!

Ha!

This is more twists and turns than the battle of endor!
Adam jar!
Stop talking, you giant nerd!
Baditude jar!
this is too easy.
Swear jar!

With that, the jar wars were on.
Meanwhile, it was all peace and love at the grateful dead show.
Dude, this 45-minute song is amazing.
And everyone's so nice.
Yeah, especially that one guy that invited me to live with him
And those 10 other guys over there on that patch of lawn.
Hey, wouldn't it be awesome
If we could listen to this concert later?
What's all that?
Definitely not illegal bootleg equipment
That'll allow me to profit after selling them later!
Hey, pal, you trying to tape the show?
Uh-oh.

We're gonna have to go, huh?
For sure.

You can go on down.
Unfortunately for my brother,
He picked the one band
Chill enough to let you tape them.
Barry, you're the man.

Why?

This doesn't make any sense.
Dead are a band of the people.

They're so nice.
Now I hate them even more!
They were supposed to kick us out!
Whoa.

I mean, not ruin.

Not cool, bro.
Yeah, man.

JTP.

Hey!

Without me, there is no JTP.
You didn't say "JTP" back.
Matt is right.

Yeah, and if that's how you want to run the JTP,
Then...

Fine.

I'll start a better, more badass posse without you.
See you around, tasty.
Since my brother lost control of the JTP,
He decided to assemble a better crew...

Okay, welcome to my all-new and improved posse.
I'm big tasty, founder and leader.
First order of business...

- How about rush?

No rush, no atkins.
Later.
Okay, so, our name has to have "Jenkintown" in it.
I was thinking the Jenkintown awesome group.
Wait... you want us to be the jags?
this is name for unbearable loser, yes?
A jag?
Foreign kid's right.

Also, why is there an old man in our super-cool group?
Every group has a life of the party,
And that's pops.
I'm our badass leader, Sergei's the funny one.
And, of course, we got our wild card, naked Dan.
Naked Dan?
This is weird.

Is decided...

While Barry was realizing what the JTP meant to him,
The jar wars had taken on a whole new meaning.
You know, I never thought I'd say these words,
But the silence is making me crazy.
Somebody say something!
Unh-unh!

We're gonna end up in colonial Williams-turd.
Baditude!

Pay up for comparing our beloved U.S. History to poo-poos.
Poo-poos!
All right, enough!
I'm putting an end to this once and for all.
Hey, I only made these other jars 'cause you made me realize that they were playing me.
Of course they were.
They're awful.
That's part of their charm,
Just like swearing's part of yours.
But Adam was right...

You swear because you care.
And I wouldn't want to change that.
For sure.

And I'm not changing.
I'm gonna keep calling them morons because they act like morons.
And I can't change the fact
Saying "star track" will always bother me.
And there's, like, zero chance of me changing my crap attitude, 'cause you're all lame.
See?

And I love it!
Dad's right.

So, we all agree...

"jar wars" sounds like "Star Wars"!
Oh, god, it felt so good to say.
With that, the jar wars came to an end.
Meanwhile, my brother was hoping for a new beginning with his friends.
Hey.
Can I talk to you guys?
Come on, guys.

Thanks, man.
I was a jerk, okay?
Look, the three of you are the first real friends I ever had,
And I just didn't want to lose you to someone else and be all alone again.
Dude.

So, to make it up to you,
I bought tickets to the next dead show.
Hoping maybe I can tag along?
Don't look at me.

No one is.

The JTP.
JTP.

Uh, bar, these tickets are for fairmount park.
How are we supposed to get there?
No way!

This seems like a big move for a band we just got into,
But I like it.

[ the Grateful Dead's "Touch of Grey" plays ]
Good to have you back, big tasty.
It's good to be back, Matt Bradley.
It was official.
The JTP had their newest, chillest member...
Matt Bradley.
And to this very day,
He's still my brother's closest, dearest friend.
That's what happens when you open your heart
And let someone in.
What's this?
We mapped out the best route to Williamsburg.
We took all the money from the swear jars and booked a hotel room.
We thought you deserved a trip.
And I say that without any attitude.
I truly, madly, deeply love you so much,
I can't stand it.
Us too, mama.
Guess I'm schlepping to Williamsburg.
Morons.
'cause in the end, no matter what you go through...
If you have your friends and family by your side,
You will get by.
Will Matthew Bradley come out as a winner today?
He's got the smile.
Or will Barry Goldberg be a winner today?
The cream is then agitated by the motion of the stick,
Creating thick, rich butter.
Ma'am, would you like to give it a try?
I'm good.
I'm approaching the natives now.
They seem to have a leader.
Dude, no!

Greetings, colonial settlers.
I have come from the year 2032
To warn you of impending doom.
Everyone disregard.
- Time travel is not part of the tour.

See, I knew you'd say that...
Proving that I'm from the future, where robots have taken over and their power source is pure, thick, rich butter!
Sorry Priya I'm joining again.

What's the fee now...
