*HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA* Season 01 Episode 04
Title: "Adventures in Vampiresitting/Phlegm Ball"
Humans!

They mock us!
They disembowel us!
They eat us!
Come on, humans don't eat us.
You saw the movie, Mavis.

I'm going to need a volunteer.
How does that always happen?
- Now, young lady...

Suppose you have the terrible, terrible luck of happening upon a human teenager...
What do you do?
Well, I guess I'd try...
Booga-booga-booga!
Funny, Hank!
All right!
Yes, but will booga-booga work against their superhuman strength!
You see?

And remember, should you ever encounter a human... beware.
Beware!

Beware!

Got a sound board for my... ♪ Birthday ♪
That was scarier than the time I saw Pedro putting scream cheese in his armpits.
Yeah, that was kinda weird...
Wait, you saw that?
Relax.

Humans are like ghosts.

I dunno.

Okay, I'll prove it to you.
And how are you gonna do that?
Oh...

Seriously, how?
I can't watch!
Will you stop that?

Sorry.

I'm done.

Right.

Can't help myself!
Whoops!

You can do this.

What's the worst that can happen?
Ah!

Oh good, you're early!
We're in a rush!
She's a goner.
Dibs on her stuff.

Donald!

Okay!

Babysitter?
Wow.

You're still undead!
Unless you're a human in a Mavis costume!
Show yourself, imposter!
Hey.
I'm not only undead, I'm inside!
Nobody ever invites vampires inside.
This is so awesome!
They're coming back!

What're you doing?

I dunno!

I was following you!
I just like to jump.
Okay, the baby's already asleep.
Oh, isn't she adorable?
So, you know, there's really not much to do.
'Cept read our diaries and eat the emergency marshmallow reserves.
Ignore him.
If you're bored, you can always read my best seller.
"Monsters Are Not Your Friends"?
You never can be too careful with those creatures across the way.
Security enabled.
And whatever you do... do not open the door for anyone!
Uh-h-h-h, sure?
Have fun!
That thing is amazing!
My turn, my turn!
Wendy, don't!
I think he took that pretty well.
So, we're alone in a human house.
And now what?
You heard the lady.

I... have a better idea.
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!

Fire, fire, fire!
Make... it... stop!
You guys, they've got a Wendy-sized swimming pool in there!
And sushi!
I would just like to point out how much fun we had and how not scary humans are.
Just like I said.
Trust me.
There is absolutely, positively, nothing to be scared of.
Really set myself up for that.
Ugh!

Like I want your kid wiping boogers on me anyway.
Hello?
Uh, yeah, it's Zoe.
Your crazy security is on again.
I can't get inside.
But, I already let you in.
Duh, no.

I'm throwin' serious shade her way, but it's not working.
Other baby sitter?
Yeah, and also, ugh, monsters.
M-m-m-monsters?
My baby!
Tuna tartare.
I wonder if I can get the tartar on the side.
Maximum security initiated.
Ah!

The nose picker!
Mama.
Sorry, but the moment was just begging for it.
Who's the little gargoyle?
And can you believe it?

Nice driving, lady!
Mommy's comin'!
There you go.

See?

You really gotta know when to quit.
You monsters don't know who you're dealing with!
Sorry, sorry!

I can't believe how wrong I was.

They're terrifying!
Uh, how long before they turn us into cookies and eat us?
Mavis, I don't wanna be eaten by a buncha cookie makers!
What do we do?

We fight back, that's what.
That's an umbrella.
I know.
Okay, okay, let's see what this wolf-puppy can do.
Siren?
Ooh, try water cannon.
Paint balls!
Ejector?

It's on the roof!
Oh!

Where's the chimney ejector button?
Ah-ha!
Somebody help us!
Where's my baby?

Open the Door!
We gotta get out of here!
Yes!

Uh, yeah, thanks.
Freeze, Monster!
No!
Shh...
I am not a monster!
We'll take it from here, young lady.

Just, um, another human doing human things like, ah, any ol' human would.
See?

Humans are nothing to be afraid of.
Donald!
So what're you having, hon?
Kitty?

♪♪
What?

*PHLEGM BALL*
♪♪
Time for some Phlegm Ball.
Neck cracking sound!
Yay!
All right!

♪ Phlegm ball!

♪ That's the name of the game ♪
♪ Bigfoot horks a loogie and the ball's in play ♪
♪ Chase it, hustle after that gob ♪
♪ It's slimy, it's drippy, booger as big as a dog ♪
♪ Spook it, you gotta scare that sucka straight ♪
♪ Pick up, drag it back, slam it in it's home ♪
♪ Time to show them monsters that they just got owned!

Yes!
Yeah, I'm just gonna say it...

Ugh.

Yeah!
Who's the undisputed Phlegm Ball champ?
This vampire!
Bravo Mavis, you truly are a champion...
Not!
Oh, you're over there.

Klaus.
Come now, why so glum?
You should be overcome with joy to see your favorite cousin Klaus straight from the 12th century!
Hi, Klaus!
It's "Klaush!"
Whatever, dude.
Anyhoo, I heard someone was getting a little too big for her britches and needed to be taught a lesson.
Ball!
Ha, as if you can beat me!
I'm undefeated!
Yes, well it is rather easy to win when every monster loses on purpose to Dracula's daughter.
Come on, no one is letting me win!

Wha?

It's just easier to let you win.
You're way too competitive.
I am not!

And even if by some impossible chance it's true, whatevs!
I can still totally beat you.
Oh, goody, so you'll put up the golden fangs then.
You want my Dad's lucky fangs?
They're a family heirloom!
With like ten generations of spit on them.
No way!
Perhaps you are too...

But if you give up,
I suppose I may have to start my victory dance a little early.
♪♪
♪ Booty shaking, booty shaking ♪
♪♪
♪ Booty in your face!

Ugh!

I never want to see that again.
And speaking of never seeing again, if I win, you stay put in the 12th century for good.
Ugh.

Whoa!
Silverfish, behave!
Now, perhaps you would like to meet my teammate:
Number Two.
Number Two?
Yes.

I can't ask for a better Number Two.
My number two is solid.
And good luck beating me with this one.
She has zero killer instinct.
I have no killer instinct?

Then what do you call this?

A ukulele.
Oh, thank you, I have been wondering for a while.
Y'know, Wendy, what our team really needs is a great cheerleader.
Uh, someone to push us to victory!
Oh, I see.
If I didn't know better, I would think that you're trying to... show me how much you respect me by handing over such an important job!
Do I get pom poms?
Of course.
Yes!

See you at game time, Big Shot!
It doesn't matter what you do, Mavis,
Count Dracula's fangs will be mine!
Me and my Number Two are going to wipe the floor with you.
What?

Come on, tell me, I love jokes!
Now I just need a teammate.
Okay, let's see what you've got!
I'm running out of options!
How am I supposed to beat Klaus now?
It's "Klaush."
Aw, yeah!
Relax, Mavis, we're ready to save your team and become famous!
One day, they'll make a movie about the brave, plucky underdogs who have no chance, but somehow win!
Well, even though you're probably not very good...
Hey!

I need a teammate.

- Sorry, Pedro.

Booyah!
Oh, you don't need me?
You're so gonna regret this!

Ow!
Ouch!

I always knew you'd recognize I was the superior choice.
Sure.

Hey, wait a second...
Shush, shush, shush, shush.
I've got a plan to win, but you need to do exactly what I say!
Whatever you want, boss!
Welcome to the Golden Fang Phlegm Ball Championship!
Go Mavis, go Mavis, go Mavis!
Things look pretty tense down there!
Skip, give us your thoughts.
Exactly!
After her!
Yay!
Hurry!
Gotcha!
You got this, Mavis.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Stop it!

Ah!
Hey!
Go Hank!
Yes!

This is the greatest feeling!
Ohh!
Boom goes the body parts!

That's right, Skip, it's the Crypt-O-Cola
Bone Crunch of the Night!
Crypt-O-Cola, now with more embalming fluid!
I can't go on.
It'll take forever to put me back together.
Hey!
Gotcha!
After it, you beast!
Ugh!

Ba-kow!

I was clearly the better choice.
But this is going to make my role in the movie even more epic!
Okay, then let's get that phlegm!
Ow!

I'm out!
Tell my story!
Oh, boy, things don't look so good for Mavis!
Or you, Skip.

Ugh, I'll never win now!
What am I gonna do?

The blob, Mavis.
Use the blob!
Go, Mavis!

You make good choices!
Hey!
Trust me!
Go team!
Yay!
Trust.

Let's get phlegmy!
Whoo!

Sorry for tricking you off the team, Wendy.
You're the best teammate I ever had...
Hey!
Harsh, but fair.
It's not the same without you.
I need you.
Well, I don't know, Mavis.
Like you said:

Okay!
I made a mistake.

I'll give you my bag of Jett Black's hair.
I'll eat the crusts off your scabby pie!
I'll take over a week of squeezing your dads blob heads?
- Ding-ding!

Let's do this!
Slither faster!
Ah!

Klaus wants a killer instinct?

It's "Klaush!"
I hope you score!
Look at you, you're so big and strong!
I bet your parents read to you at night.
You were clearly raised well!
Nobody's ever been nice to you before?
That doesn't seem right.

Foul!

Referee, call a foul;

Come on, forget the game.

Boom-drac-alacka!

Wait!

You still have the ball!

Ze game is not over!
Got it!
No!
Admit defeat!
Never!
You must!

The phlegm ball is mine!
Wow, they've been at it for like three weeks now.
What's this about again?
Dunno, vampire stuff or something.
