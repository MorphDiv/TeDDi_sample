Previously on " Nashville"...
- You know Jessie Caine?

- Nice to see you

Do you think that I invited you to hear my songs so that I could insinuate myself into your life.
No, no, I'm just trying to be clear about me.
Okay, I'm gonna go.
Brand partnerships.
The best kind of integration is entirely frictionless.
Billy put together a tour for me.
I don't want you to leave.
I need to do this for myself now.
- There's Flynn.

Yeah, I want it.

♪ Baby if I've got you I don't need... ♪
Daphne?
I'm leaving in five minutes if you still want that ride?
- Okay.

♪ I don't need a parachute Baby if I've got you, baby... ♪
- Hello?

It's Kristi Roberts from FosterMore.
Oh, Kristi, hello.

We appreciate it.
- She's a real pistol, isn't she?

Well, I think we put her in a real good home.
That is fantastic, I cannot wait to tell the girls that.
Well, I'm so excited you're playing our benefit tomorrow.
- You know, Rayna's support

- meant the world to us.

That's why I'm happy to do it, all right?
But we were hoping to have your auction item in by now.
Kristi, I'm sorry.

Because normally we put it in the program and...
Yeah.

Hey, I completely understand.
Now it'll be something she performed in, right?
Yeah, absolutely...

I assume you want me to just bring it.

That would be wonderful.
- I'll do it, okay.

- I'm ready!

Oh, there she is.

Hey!

- I'm a huge fan.

What you did with the choreography in Kesha's new video was insane.
Oh, well, thank you.
Can you please tell her that?

Tonya, can I get a full extension on that, please?
Thank you, baby.
Is there anything I need to know for tomorrow?
No, we'll make it very user-friendly.
Well, don't make it too user-friendly, I want to look good.
Yeah, well, I heard about your injuries and all.
I'm really sorry about all of that.

It's all in the past.

Well, okay, that's what's up.
All right, well, I'm looking forward to it.
You and me both.
All right, I'll see you soon, sweetness.
Okay, bye.
Thanks for coming in, guys.
Dan is aware of all your concerns.
That's why he wanted to meet in person.
Yeah, we're just not sure it's the best time to be shooting a commercial.
Yeah.

That actually would make a great commercial.
Remember, guys, we don't do commercials like other people.
Birch Tree Habitat is the Geico of furniture companies.
Well, I love the one, you know... the dogs are all sitting in the living room drinking tea.
The Corgi barks at her husband for dropping the crumbs!
It gets me everytime.
See?

And just make it fun.
Like in this case, the joke is entirely on us.
Let me ask you, what is the first thing you think of when you think of Birch Tree Habitat?
Go ahead.

Your furniture is impossible to put together.
Exactly.

We spent millions redesigning our assembly procedure.
So from now on, it's easy.
Well, okay.

Where do we fit in to that?
The two of you are standing in a room.
We hear one of your amazing songs.
A voice says, "The Exes.
Country music's favorite on-again, off-again couple."
An unopened box gets brought into the room.
And we see you in sped-up motion easily assemble this brand new dining room table.
When you're finished, you lean up against it.
And you're very proud of your work.
And the voice says, "Life is complicated.
Putting our furniture together doesn't have to be."
That is great.
You see, our demographic is over 50% millennials.
And they get that life is complicated.
It's hard to have a career.
It's hard to believe in the future.
It's hard to have a relationship.
And right now, guys, honestly, you represent that perfectly.
We show that Birch Tree Habitat will be there through all of their complications.
Thoughts?
- Hey.

Aren't you about ready to leave town?

Yeah...

And I'm sorry for the way things ended with Hallie.
Oh, don't be.

Charlie's gonna produce this.

Yeah, he'll do a great job.
It honestly doesn't take much to make her sound good.
That's true.

I should be.
It's just... it's different when you have a kid, you know.
Yeah.
She said her first sentence the other day.
- She did really?

Give me milk.
Looks like you got you a genius.
Yeah, she's got her first big girl bed coming next week.
There's just so many firsts.
And I don't want to miss any of them.
Yeah.
- How you holding up, man?

Yeah, I can tell.
I'm doing this benefit tomorrow night for this charity.
It meant a whole lot to Rayna.

Should be this simple deal, but... got me all jacked up.
- You know, no reason.

It's been a while just, you know, I keep thinking.
Maybe I should be a little further along by now, you know.
Yeah.

I know.
What am I supposed to do, though?

Build a shrine to her?

She'd be the first one to say so too, she would.
Listen, Deacon.
I-I can't imagine what you're going through.
I really can't, but at the end of the day, what's on these walls, what's in her closet?
It's just stuff, right?
I mean, the life that you shared.

Now that, that's a different story.
Nobody can take that away.
That stuff's eternal.
You're gonna be a good dad.
Go get 'em!
So, what is this benefit you're playing?
Uh, FosterMore, the charity your mom used to work with.
- Hey, you wanna go?

- Uh-uh.

Of course, it is.

Bring Daphne where?
Uh, the FosterMore event.

I did that last year.
I know.

Um, I was invited to a party at Rebecca's house.
Oh, what kind of party?
It's like a bunch of kids just watching a scary movie.
Mm-hmm.

Of course.
Okay.

All right, I gotta get going myself.
Oh, listen...
I wanted to run something by you guys.
Kristi from FosterMore wanted to know if we could donate some item of clothing of Mom's that they could auction off.
You wanna give something of Mom's away?
- Well, yeah.

What?

- I'm sorry.

I didn't know it would upset you guys so much.
- Yeah, actually, it does.

Okay, I get that.

I won't do it.
I'm putting it back right away.

Wait, that's what you want to donate?
Yeah.
That's fine.

Yeah, it's terrible.

- You sure?

It's ugly.
The flowers are dorky.
Our daughter just said, "I love rabbit."
- What?

She picked it up and hugged it.

I told you the kid's a genius.
How am I supposed to leave now?
Hey, the first leg is only two weeks...
Two weeks?

I hope not.
Just promise me you won't let her do anything new while I'm gone, okay?

I want it recorded from multiple angles.
Okay, as long as you promise to stay on the straight and narrow.
My God, you're confusing me with my younger self.
The tour's gonna go great.
- I'm proud of you.

I'm gonna go load the car.
- Okay.

Alyssa says this could run for months.
And if they like it, they might have us do another.
So we do more of these?
Well, if that's what it takes to get a record out there, yeah.
I never thought I'd be writing jingles for a living.
All right, come on.

Millions of people are gonna hear it over and over.
And think of furniture.
Hey, you guys ready to rock this thing?
Yeah.

- Yeah, well, it doesn't look like it.

Just give me a couple of rehearsals...

Look, baby, I don't want you to hurt yourself.
- I'm not gonna hurt myself.

I'm surprised you're strutting around here as well as you are.
Come on, let me make it a little easier for you.
Let the kids do all the heavy lifting, huh?
All you need to do is stand here and look pretty.
You know what, how about we don't make it easier?
- Yeah...

All right.
All right, people, let's start from the top.
You heard the lady.
If you'll sign right here,
I'll have someone take your bags to your room for you.
All right.

Yeah, the bar's right over there.
Okay, thanks.
- My first customer.

Manhattan with a twist, very dry with a splash of vermouth?
Um, I'll just have a Coke.
My kind of man.
You in town for work?
- Sort of.

CIA?
If I told you, I'd have to kill you.
Seriously...
You're not a food critic, are you?
Because our chef is on vacation.
No.

No way.

- All my friends are going.

Because I'm stuck here serving people like you.
Except... you're not gonna be here because you're opening for Dierks Bentley!
Bastard!
- I'm Nell, by the way.

I'll forgive you if you bring me back a t-shirt.
Can you make my eyes look smokey?
Uh, not for another year or two.
But I can make your cheeks rosier.
Okay, anything.

- Why are you so nervous?

- Do I look nervous?

Maddie, there's gonna be a lot of eighth graders there.
Eighth graders are just like seventh graders, only a little older.
That's why I'm nervous.
Okay.

- Shut up.

Just be yourself.

Zach sends his regards from Richard Branson's island.
Well, I want his life.
You guys look adorable.

Well, I'm pretty sure we're gonna screw this thingy up, but...
Guys, you look great.

- Thanks.

- Dan.

Well, they're all afraid to have their own opinions.
So this is it, guys.

- Good enough.

I'm sorry, I thought, uh, we were assembling a table, right?
Well, we thought, what the hell?

You were right.
- Yeah, well, I didn't want to be.

I should have rehabbed it harder, worked harder...
No, see, I'm guessing that you killed it in rehab.
That's where you injured yourself.
Because you were working so hard.
You know, baby, back in the day when I was younger,
I used to dance with Alvin Ailey.
Old man could do 30 pirouettes in a row.
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

But guess how many I can do now?
Three.

Arthritis so bad, I can't even stand on the ball of that foot.
Baby, being human is a bitch.
Took me a long time to let go of who I thought I should be.
And find out who I really was.
Now, you can still dance.
You just have to do it the way you can do it now.
Not how you used to do it a year ago.
And forgive yourself.
All right, come on, let's get up off this floor.
We got work to do.
There he is!
Hello, Kristi.
So good to see you.
- As promised.

My girls were a little reluctant to part with it.
I had to twist their arms.
It's beautiful.
So who am I embarrassing myself with tonight?
You are the star attraction.
- You and Martina...

- And Lady Antebellum.

And someone you might remember, Jessie Caine.
She's fantastic.
I know.

And I'd better get this over to the auction people.
I think they're ready for your sound check now.
Thank you.
- Hey!

I don't hear anything.

I don't know.
- Where is everybody?

I don't know.
It was supposed to be a huge party.
- You want a soda?

- Is he your boyfriend?

He's cute.

Where's everybody else?
Why would you want anybody else?
Thanks.
- Finally!

- Who left?

They were supposed to leave like an hour ago.
- I told my dad they were gonna be here.

Let's get this thing started!
Who wants some wine?

♪ You probably have the right to say ♪

I am incapable of missing!

Incorrect!
- Is he correct?

Okay, that was a pilot error.
This one will be unerring!
Nell!

Thank God you're here.

- We need more beers.

- Huh?

Hi.

What?
- I said I miss you!

How was tonight?
Oh, we killed!

I mean, you should have been there!
I wish I was.
What?
Can you go somewhere quieter so we can talk?
It's been a little bit of a rough day.
I can't hear you.
Whoever this is, you're seriously infringing on Avery's drinking time.
So maybe you should just let him...
Uh, sorry about that.

- Who was that?

I can't believe she just said that.
But, anyway, what's up, hon?

You know what?

Just call me when you get back to the room, okay?
No, no, no...

You're out with your friends.
Just call me later.
What happened to the movie?
I know.

- "Night of the Living Dead"?

It's one of the best apocalyptic films ever.
Good as "Dawn of the Dead" or the original "Planet of the Apes".
What's it about?
A guy and a girl get trapped in a house with a bunch of zombies.
- You mean, like this?

How do you become a zombie anyways?
You get bitten by a dead person.
I don't feel very good.
- Jessie.

It's glad to hear you're playing tonight.
I wasn't when I heard who else is gonna be up there.
- That's some tall cotton.

Thank you.
Guess I'm here.

- Let's cut!

Hey, you okay?
What's the matter with her?
I just don't think I can do it.
Just take it easy.

It's okay.

Hey.

I can't do this...

You're gonna be fine.

Yeah.

Alyssa, I really don't think I can do this.

We're right in the middle of it.
Well, they said it would be a table.
Why is it a crib?

Okay, you know what?

- Please, yes.

I don't understand why the crib's such a big deal.
Because my baby's not even born yet.
And we're already pimping her out for some more Instagram followers.
- Scarlett, it's just a commercial.

Okay, so I talked to the director.
And he said that we only have an hour left.
So there's not enough time to start over again with a table.
I'm really sorry.
No, it's fine.

Okay.
All right, reset.
She's never gonna match.

- Yeah.

Let's just set up and hope she calms down.
This has never happened to me before.
Never a dull moment in the ad world.
Oh, and it's one bark when he wants to go out.
And two when he wants to eat.
Oh, he gets so mad when I'm sad.
Martha, why are you crying?

You have a dog?
I had a lab named, um... it's a long story.
Well, look who's on the bill tonight.
Hello, Brad.
If I had known, I would have brought Jake along.
- He'd love to see him mom play.

Well, he couldn't come anyway.

- Again?

Do your homework or pay the consequences.
Oh, it's not that simple...

Oh, my goodness.

And we're getting him past that.
Well, hey, there, Deacon Claybourne, media tycoon.
Hello.

I'm hearing great things about that boy genius of yours, huh?
Might even turn a profit.
You know, anything can happen.
Yeah.

I better watch out.

- of Shiny New Records, huh?

- Completely friendly takeover.

Bring it, boy.

I think we both know who'd win that one, huh, right?
Hey, y'all are in for a treat tonight.
I discovered this woman.

- Y'all enjoy your evening.

You okay?
Yeah.
I just thought tonight was gonna be something a little different.
So pissed at Chad right now.
All this so that he can make out with Rebecca Carton.
It's much nicer out here.
Yeah.
Isn't that cool?
I didn't know birds sang at night.
They don't usually.
Could be a Whippoorwill, a Mockingbird.
Or a Mockingbird pretending to be a Whippoorwill.
How do you know so much about birds?
I just read.
I was a dinosaur freak when I was younger.
I just like anything about the natural world.
Cool.
A human world is a little more confusing.
I'm sorry about tonight.
It's okay.
I didn't want you to think that's why I invited you.
I mean, I would have invited you if I thought...
I mean, I would never assume, of course, but,
I didn't want you to think I hadn't...
I'm just making things worse, aren't I?
No, it's okay.

Who knew parties could be so stressful?
If this is what eighth grade is like,
I think I'll try and be held back.
Same here.
Don't ask for another.

I should go anyway.
Hey, who do I call if my TV's not working?
The front desk.

Who won't know how to fix it.
- Thank you.

Huh?

Who is raining on your parade?
Rain isn't exactly the word I would use.
It's more like a hurricane.
Crashing waves and howling wind.
And destruction everywhere.
And then, all of a sudden, peace.
At least for a while.
And if she's a hurricane, what are you?
I am the calm in the middle.
I mean, I follow behind her, and pick up the pieces.
Not much fun.
That's probably why I'm here.
On tour, that is.

I'm pretty sure I can fix your TV.
You're home early.

Horrible beyond belief.
What?

There was only like eight people there.
And then it turned out to be this weird make-out orgy.
Oh, my God.

No!

I was totally grossed out.

Good for you.

He came out too.

- And?

We just talked about all kinds of stuff.
Birds,..

And then you kissed?
No!
No, of course not.

I kind of wanted to.
All right.
But at the same time, I really didn't.
Yeah, it's okay.

How do you know when you're ready?
Well, Mom says you just kind of know.
That's what happened for me.
Okay, y'all!

We have one more item to auction off.
And let me tell you, we have saved the best for last.
Let's bring it out.
Now this was worn by the Queen of Country herself.
The late, great Rayna James.
Isn't that absolutely beautiful?
Now through your generosity, tonight we're gonna be helping children get off the streets.
So I'm gonna help you get your checkbook out of your pockets.
And we're gonna start the bidding at $5,000.
Somebody give me $5,000.
I got $5,000 from that gentleman right over there.
Now, Sir, are you gonna be wearing that yourself?
- I know my wife will.

Because you know what they say, right, everybody?
Happy wife, happy life.
All right, somebody give me $7,500.

- $10,000!

Somebody say 15?

- 15!

That's what I want to see!
A bidding war for this gorgeous piece of history right here.
Come on now. $20,000.
We are talking about the Queen of Country right here.
Now who would not want a piece of that legacy?
- $25,000.

I love it and she's bidding against herself!
That's what I like to see!
But, Sir, you are not gonna let her get away with that, are you?
Come on now.

Say it with me.

- $30.

- 35.

- 40.

It's getting ridiculous out here.

This is great, but you know what, ladies and gentlemen?
I think it's time to separate the ladies from the boys.
And I'm gonna do it right here.
50 grand for that treasure right there.
Somebody's good for it.
How about my little lady right here?
I love her.

But not that much?
My husband's gonna kill me as it is.
Aw, I'm sorry to hear that.
Looks like we know who's not getting any tonight.
- 50 grand!

$50,000!

Alyssa says they're gonna try to cut together what they got, so...
Don't feel bad.
I can't help it.

Would you mind stopping?

- Yeah, sure.

I don't feel like I really want to talk right now, Jes...
Sorry.

No.
And a good time was had by all, huh?
Yeah, it's time like these I really wish I still smoked.
Or had a gun.
He's quite a charming fellow...
You don't need to talk to me.
I get why you're out here.
All for a good cause, I guess.
Yeah, well, I'm sure it doesn't... make it hurt any less.
You know, some days it's like I can barely stand to be seen.
That's been my life for the last four years.
At least you're free of him now, huh?
You think this is about Brad?
This isn't about Brad.
I'd be happy to never think about him for as long as I live.
It's about our son who... he's killing day by day.
Cruelty by cruelty.

There's nothing you can do about it?
You really don't listen to gossip, do you?
The, to fill you in, I'm an unfit mother who is prone to irrational behavior, and uncontrollable rage.
And it's got to be true, right?

And his assistant said it.

And the fact that he employs all of them would never come into play.

I'm sorry, Jessie.
You know, I would never presume to know your pain, because,
honestly, I've never had a love like that.
But I'm watching somebody that I love... die in slow motion.
And I would do anything for that boy.
I'm sorry...

It's okay.
- You're up next, Mr. Claybourne.

- Listen, Jessie...

I intruded on your solitude.
- And I'm sorry, I really am.

I think it's all gonna be all right.
I think...
I do.

You think I'm tough?
Yeah.
Ask the trashcans.
Sing well.
You too.
Excuse me just one second.
Hey.
Why didn't you text me back?
I just got to the room.
Why are you whispering?
I'm not whispering.
How was your day?

Are you alone?
Of course, I'm alone.

I want to know how your day went.
You know what, it was really sucky, okay?
And I could have used someone to talk to.
But I get it.

You know what?

Let's just talk tomorrow when you are sober.
No, no, no, come on.

I don't know!

I can hear that you're in a bathroom.
You're acting totally weird.

You couldn't wait one day to get back into the swing of things?
You're right.

I knew it.
I'm with Yuri who's fixing the television.
It's my wife.
Who is this, please?
Hi.

- She wants you back.

I'm gonna kill you.
And I love you.
I cannot fix this.
I call in the morning to maintenance.

Okay, yeah, yeah.

And I miss you.
You do?
Yes, terribly.
How can I miss you this much after one day?
I miss you too.
Why'd you have to leave?
I don't know.

And then when I got here,
I realized that that's not really me anymore.
You know, I like the new me better.
The one that has you and Cadence in his life.
I want to come home.
No, no you don't.
As much as I want you to...
I can't let you.
Why not?
Because then you'll end up resenting me.
You'll act out and we'll start repeating old patterns.
It won't be good for either one of us.
You need to get this out of your system.
Yeah, but what about Cadence?
She's still gonna be here.

Yeah, but she's gonna do something new, and I'm gonna miss it.
I know the feeling.
I love you.
Call me in the morning.
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for Mr. Deacon Claybourne!
Thank you.
I was gonna do something else, but this seems maybe a little more appropriate, and uh...
This is for Rayna.

Listen, I know what happened tonight.
What happened tonight?
What's the point of even saying it?

It's not obvious to me.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why you cried.
Can we please not talk about that again?
How long we gonna put it off, Scarlett?

When it's staring us right in the face?

You've been dancing around it saying every possible thing,
- except... except the truth.

No.

You don't want me, period.
No, that is not it at all actually...
- No, that's exactly it.

So just for once, why don't you just have the courage
- just to say it out loud.

You don't want me in your life.

Hey, man?
Uh, buy us some beer?

Yeah, not tonight, buddy, all right?
Oh, please, it'll only take a second.
Look, your friend looks old enough, okay... he can go buy it.
Well, we tried, but they're so mean in there.
You got a lot of time to drink ahead of you kids.

- Shut up, bitch.

You think you're pretty tough, huh, man?
You got my wallet.

You think you can tell me what to do?

Get on your knees.
- Jamie, come on.

Okay.
Oh, you want my gun.
