Hey, where you going?
The morning bell ain't rung yet.

I wanna beat the other fellows to the street.
I don't want anyone should see.
I...
I ain't been walkin' so good.
Quit griping'.
You know how many fellows fake a limp for sympathy, right?
That bum leg of yours is a gold mine.
Someone gets the idea I can't make it on my own, they'll lock me up in the Refuge for good.
Hey, be a pal, Jack.

Whoa!
Do you wanna bust your other leg, too?
No, I wanna go down.
You'll be down there soon enough!
Take a moment.
Drink in my...

High above the stinkin' streets in New York.
You're crazy.
What, 'cause I like a breath of fresh air?
'Cause I like seeing the sky and the stars?
Yeah, you're seeing stars, all right.
Them streets down there...
They sucked the life right outta my old man.
Years of rotten jobs, stomped on by bosses.
And when they finally broke him, they...

Well, they ain't doin' that to me!
But...

New York's fine for those who got a big strong door to lock it out.
Yeah, but I tell you, Crutchie, there is a whole other way out there.
So, you keep your small life in a big city.
Give me a big life in a small town.
They say folks is dyin' to get here
Me, I'm dyin' to get away
To a little town out west that's spankin' new
And while I ain't never been there
I can see it clear as day
If you want
I bet you you could see it, too
Close your eyes
Come with me
Where it's clean and green and pretty
And they went and made a city outta clay
Like the minute that you get there
Folks will walk right up and say
"Welcome home, son
"Welcome home to Santa Fe!"
Plantin' crops, splitting' rails
Swappin' tales around the fire
Oh, 'cept for Sunday when you lie around all day
Soon your friends are more like family
And they's beggin' you to stay
Ain't that neat?
Livin' sweet
In Santa Fe
You got folks there?
Ain't got no folks nowhere.
What, you?
I don't need folks.
I got friends.
Hey.

How's about you come with me?
No one cares about no bum leg in Santa Fe.
No, you just...

You ride it in style.
Yeah!

Hey!

Santa Fe
You can bet
We won't let them bastards beat us
We won't beg no one
To treat us fair and square
There's a life that's worth the livin'
And I'm gonna do my share
Work the land
Chase the sun
Swim the whole Rio Grande just for fun
Watch me stand!
Watch me run...
Hey.
Hey.
Don't you know that we's a family?
Hey, would I let ya down?

No way
Just hold on, kid
'Til that train makes Santa Fe
Time for dreaming's done.
-Yeah?

Hey, Specs!
Racer, Henry, Albert, Elmer!
Get a move on!

Hey, Albert, Elmer, Specs, you heard Jack.
Get a move on.
I was having the most beautiful dream.
My lips are still tingling'.
A pretty girl?
A leg of lamb.
Hey, that's my cigar
You'll steal another
Hey, look, it's bath time at the zoo
I thought that I'd surprise my mother
If you can find her.
Who asked you?
Papes ain't moving' like they used to.
I think I need a new selling' spot.

From Bottle Alley to the harbor
There's easy pickin's guaranteed
Try any banker, bum, or barber
They almost all knows how to read
It's a crooked game we're playin'
One we'll never lose
Long as suckers don't mind payin'
Just to get bad news
Ain't it a fine life
Carryin' the banner through it all
A mighty fine life
Carryin' the banner tough and tall
When that bell rings
We goes where we wishes We's as free as fishes
Sure beats washing dishes
What a fine life
Carryin' the banner home free all
Well, hello, hello, hello, beautiful.
Step aside, Romeo.

Mornin', miss.
May I interest you in the latest news?
The paper isn't out yet.
I would be delighted to deliver it to you personally.
I've got a headline for you.
"Cheeky Boy Gets Nothing For His Troubles."
Back to the bench, slugger.
-You struck out.

Hey, Crutchie.
What's your leg say?

No rain.
Partly cloudy, clear by evening'.
They ought to bottle this guy!
Yeah, and the limp sells 50 papes a week all by itself.
I don't need the limp to sell papes.

It takes a smile that spreads like butter
The kind that turns a lady's head
It takes an orphan with a stutter
-Who's also blind

And dead
Summer stinks and winter's freezing
When you works outdoors
Start out sweating', end up sneezin'
In between, it pours
Still, it's a fine life
Carryin' the banner with me chums
Still, it's a fine life Carryin' the banner with me chums
A bunch of big shots Tossin' out a freebie to the bums
A bunch of big shots Tossin' out a freebie
Hey, what's the holdup?
Waitin' makes me antsy I likes living chancy
Harlem to Delancey What a fine life
Carryin' the banner through the...
Bless the children
Though you wander
Lost and depraved
Jesus
Loves you
You shall
Be saved
Thanks for the grub, Sister.
Elmer, when are we going to see you inside the church?
I don't know, Sister.

Curdled
Just give me half a cup
Coffee
Something to wake me up
-Concrete donuts

Sprinkled with mold
It's gettin' bad out there
Papers is all I got
It's 88 degrees
Jack says to change my spot
Wish I could catch a breeze
-Just two

All I can catch is fleas
If I hate the headline I'll make up a headline
And I'll say anything I have to...
'Cause at two for a penny
If I take too many
Weasel just makes me eat 'em afta...
Got a feelin' 'bout the headline!
I smells me a headline!
Papes are gonna sell like we was givin' 'em away
What a switch, soon we'll all be rich
Don't know a better way to make a newsie's day
You wanna move the next edition
Give us an earthquake or a war
How 'bout a crooked politician?
Ya nitwit, that ain't news no more!
Uptown to Grand Central Station
Down to City Hall
We improves our circulation
Walkin' till we fall
-But we'll be out there

Carrying the banner man to man
Papes is gonna sell like we was givin' 'em away!
We're always out there
Soakin' ev'ry sucker that we can!
Don't know any better way to make a newsie's day!
Here's the headline "Newsies on a Mission!"
Kill the competition!

We'll be out there carrying' the banner!
See us out there carrying' the banner!
Always out there carrying' the banner!
Hey, look!

I hope it's real bloody with a nice, clear picture!
Yeah!
The trolley strike?

Man, three weeks of the same story.
They're killin' us with that snoozer.
Hey, make way!

Dear me!

I fear the sewers may have backed up during the night.
Or could it be...
The Delancey brothers!
Hey, Oscar, word on the street says you and your brother took money to beat up striking trolley workers.
So?

By cracking' the heads of defenseless workers?
I take care of the guy who takes care of me.
Hey, ain't your father one of the strikers?
-Guess he didn't take care of me!

You want some of that, too?

-Hey!

All right, five to one Jack skunks him!
-Yeah!

One unfortunate day, you might find you got a bum gam of your own.
How'd you like us picking' on you, huh?
Hey!

Wait 'til I get my hands on you.
You gotta catch me first!
Go, Jack!
We'll all be out there
Carryin' the banner man to man
We're always out there
Soakin' ev'ry sucker that we can
Here's the headline
"Newsies on a Mission!"
Kill the competition!
Sell the next edition!
We'll be out there carrying' the banner!
See us out there carrying' the banner!
Always out there carrying' the banner!
Go!
Papes for the newsies!

Morning, Weasel!

The name's Wiesel.
Ain't that what I said?

Hundred papes for the wise guy.
How's it goin', Weasel?
At least call me Mister.
Well, I'll call you sweetheart if you'd spot me 50 papes, huh?
Drop the cash and move it along.
Well, whatever happened to romance?
Fifty for the Racer.

Good morning, Mr. Wiesel.
Fifty papes for Crutchie.
Have a look at this.

I'm new, too!
Hey, don't worry, kid.
-It rubs right off.

I'll take 20 newspapers please.
Twenty for the new kid.
And let's see the dime.
I'll pay when I sell them.
Funny, kid, Come on.

But whatever I don't sell, you buy back, right?
Certainly!

I put a penny under your pillow.
Come on!

Move it along.
Albert, let me see your money!
You have a very interesting face.
Ever think about getting into moving pictures?
-You really think I could?

Buy a ticket.

I'm sorry.

I paid for 20, but you gave me 19.
You seen how nice I was to the new kid?
-And what do I get for my civility?

-Ungrounded accusations.

He said beat it!
Whoa!
New kid's right, Wiesel.

Hey, I'm sure it's an honest mistake on account of Oscar can't count to 20 with his shoes on.
Here!
-Now take a hike!

Give the new kid 50 more papes.
I don't want more papes.
What kind of newsie don't want more papes?
Yeah.

I'm no charity case.

His name's Jack.
Yeah, this here is the famous Jack Kelly.
He once escaped jail on the back of Teddy Roosevelt's carriage.
Made all the papes.
-How old are you, kid?

Well, if anybody asks, you're seven.
Younger sells more papes, and if we're gonna be partners...
Who said we want a partner?
Selling with Jack is the chance of a lifetime.
You learn from him, you learn from the best.
If he's the best, what's he need with me?
'Cause you got a little brother and I don't.
With that puss, we could easy sell 1,000 papes a week.
Hey, look sad, kid.
We're gonna make millions!
This is my brother David.

Hey, nice to meet you, Davey.
My two bits come off the top, we split everything else 70-30, all right?
Fifty-fifty.

Sixty-forty.

Deal!
That's disgusting.
That's just business.
Newsies, hit the streets!
The sun is up, the headline stinks, and this kid ain't getting any younger!
We'll all be out there
Carryin' the banner man to man
We're always out there
Soakin' ev'ry sucker that we can
Here's the headline
"Newsies on a Mission!"
Kill the competition!
Sell the next edition!
We'll be out there
Carryin' the banner!
See us out there
Carryin' the banner!
Always out there
Carryin' the banner!
Go!
Gentlemen, The World is in trouble.
Our circulation is down for the third quarter in a row.
But, Mr. Pulitzer, every paper's circulation is down since the war ended.
Whoever said "War is hell" wasn't trying to sell newspapers.
-We could use an exciting headline.

The trolley strike.
That's not exciting?
-It's epic.

Folks wanna know, "Is the trolley comin' or am I walking'?"
No one cares why.
And the strike's about to be settled.
Governor Roosevelt just put his support behind the workers.
That man is a socialist.
Teddy Roosevelt is no socialist.

The man wants to outlaw football for being too violent!
Football!

You're right.

Mr. Pulitzer, you must try to sit still.
Gentlemen, please.

And when Nunzio gets nervous,
I don't look pretty.
You never liked Roosevelt.
You wrote an editorial against him day after day when he ran for governor.
And guess what, he got elected.
How can I influence voters if they're not reading my opinion?
-Big photos attract readers.

But without flashy photos and headlines, how are we supposed to sell more papers?
The answer is right before your eyes.
You're not thinking this through.
People...
Nunzio knows when he's cutting my hair
Trim a bit here and then trim a bit there
Just a modest adjustment can fatten the bottom line...
Mr. Pulitzer, please.
Shaving is tricky, the razor should float
Shave me too close and you may cut my throat
It's the simplest solutions that bolster the bottom line
How does that help us sell more papers?
We don't sell papers, silly.

Exactly, silly.
-Newsies sell papers.

Right now, we charge the newsies
-50 cents for 100 papers.

But if we raise their price to 60 cents per 100...
Now you're getting somewhere.
A mere tenth of a penny per paper?
Every single newsie would have to sell 10 more papers just to earn the same amount as always.
My thought exactly.

But it's going to be awfully rough on those children.
Nonsense.

I couldn't offer them a better education if they were my own.
Give me a week and I'll train 'em to be
Like an army that's marching to war
Proud of themselves and so grateful to me
They'll be begging to pay even more
When there's dirt on your shoes, boys
For God's sake, relax
Why throw them out?

Listen well to these barbershop lessons
For they'll see you through
When you're stuck in the muck you'll be fine
You'll erase any trace of decline
-With a trim!

-And a shine

Once again is mine!
The price for the newsies goes up in the morning
Just a few common cents, gents
That's the bottom line...
Every new outcome is income for you
Thanks to that bottom line!
Extra!

Sunup to sundown
Knowin' where my customers will be
Sunup to sundown
Watchin' all the ladies watching' me
Walk my shoes off got the dough to show it
Probably I'll blow it Then before you know it
We'll be out there carrying' the banner
Paper!

Sing him to sleep, why don't you?
Extra!

"Terrified flight from burning' inferno."
You heard the story right here.
Thanks, mister.
You just made that up.
I did not.

Well, my father taught us not to lie.
Yeah!

Hey!

-I got one more.

Give it here!
Go, go, go.
Buy a pape from a poor orphan boy.
You dear thing.

Here's a dime.
Born to the breed.
This is so much better than school!
-This kid.

When Pop goes back to work, we go back to school.
Hey, so, how's about we divvy up the money?
We'll grab some chow and find you someplace safe to spend the night.

No, we gotta get home.

You got folks, huh?
-Doesn't everyone?

Our dad tangled with a delivery truck on the job.
Messed up his leg bad, so they laid him off.
That's how come we had to find work.
Yeah, sure, that...

Too...

Look, why don't you come home with us for dinner?
Our folks will be happy to have you.
-Mom's a great cook.

Thanks for the invite.
I just remembered I got plans with a fella.
He's probably waiting' on me right now.

-Is that the guy you're meetin'?

-Kelly!

-Kelly!

This way, Officer!
Jack Kelly!
Hurry!

Down here.

Slow down.

Does someone wanna tell me why I'm running?
I got no one chasing me!
Who was that guy?
That, there, was Snyder the Spider.

He runs a jail for underage kids called the Refuge.
The more kids he brings in, the more city pays him.
Problem is, all that money goes right into his own pocket.
Just do yourself a favor.

I hear you.
Hey!

No kids allowed in the theater!
Not even me, Miss Medda?
-Jack Kelly?

Man of mystery.
Get yourself down here and give me a hug.
Where you been keepin' yourself, kid?
Never far from you, Miss Medda.
Boys!

She also owns the joint.
The only thing I own is the mortgage.
-Pleasure, gents.

What is wrong with you?
Are you blind?

-That's her costume!

Well, step out of his way so's he can get a better look.
Theater's not only entertaining, it's educational.
Got the picture, kid?
Say, Miss Medda, we got a little situation on the street.
You mind if I hide out here a while?
Where better to escape trouble than a theater?
Is Snyder after you again?
Hey, Jack, did you really escape jail on the back of Teddy Roosevelt's carriage?
Come on, what would the governor be doing at a juvenile jail?
It so happens he was running for office, and he wanted to show he cared about orphans and such.
So while he got his mug in a pape, I got my butt in the backseat, and off we rode together.
You really know the governor?
He don't, but I do!
Say, Jack, when you've got time,
I want you to paint me another one of these backdrops.
-Sure.

-Yeah.

And things have been going so well that I can actually pay.
I couldn't take your money, Miss Medda.
You pictured that?
Your friend is quite an artist.
All right.

You're really good.
-That boy's got natural aptitude.

Jeez!

Miss Medda, you're on!
I am?

You're good.
Boys, lock the door and stay all night.
You're with Medda now.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Please welcome the star of our show,
Miss Medda Larkin!
I'm doing all right for myself, folks
I'm healthy, I'm wealthy I'm wise
My investments and such have all gone up so much
Seems whatever I touch
Starts to rise
I've been all kinds of lucky
And yet
The thing I want most
I can't get...
Well, hello!
Welcome to my theater.
Now, listen.
I live in a mansion on Long Island Sound
I pulled up a weed They found oil in the ground
But you telling me you don't want me around
Now, honey, that's rich!
Some guys give me ermine chinchilla, and mink
And some give me diamonds as big as a sink
But you wouldn't give me so much as a wink
Now, baby, that's rich!
I get brandy from Andy and candy from Scott
And Frank and Eduardo chipped in for a yacht
I get stares from the fellas and prayers from the Pope
But I ran out my luck getting stuck with some dope
Hey, honey, I was just talking about you!
Now, listen, sport, this life's too short
To waste it on you
It may be rough, but soon enough
I'll learn to make do with
The mansion, the oil well the diamonds, the yacht
With Andy, Eduardo the Pontiff and Scott
And Frank, and my bank
So spill no tears for me
'Cause there's one thing you ain't
That I'll always be
And, honey, yeah, that's right
That's rich!
That's rich!
That's
Rich
That's rich!
Thank you!
Thank you!
And now, gents...
Let's have a big hand for the Bowery Beauties!
Why don't you go find out?
Don't come a-knocking on my door
Hello, again.
This is a private box.
What, you want I should lock the door?
Twice in one day.

Go away.

A working girl, huh?

Reviewing the show for The New York Sun.
Hey!

Somewhere out there someone cares.
Go tell them.
The view is better here.
Please go.

Well, then you're gonna make a lousy reporter.
The name's Jack Kelly.
Is that what it says on your rap sheet?
A smart girl, huh?
I admire smart girls.
Beautiful.

-Do you mind?

You got in for free.

I'm sorry, Miss Medda.
I got no use for moonlight
Or sappy poetry
Love at first sight's for suckers
At least it used to be
Look, girls are nice once or twice
Till I find someone new
But I never planned
On no one like you
Don't come a-knocking on my door
I got no use
-You aren't welcome here no more

I should've known you stunk like yesterday's trash
Or sappy poetry
The night you stole my heart plus $40 in cash
-Turns out my beau is just some bum

Turns out that love ain't blind it's dumb ...for suckers At least it used to be
You got no education and you dress like a thug
You kiss like my Dalmatian and you lie like a rug
-What are you doing?

Quiet down.

You are the most impossible boy...
Ever.
Don't come a-knocking on my door!
-No, I never planned on no one

Like you
Man, them fire sirens kept me awake all night.
Sirens is like lullabies to me.
The louder they wail, the better the headline.
The better the headline, the better I eat.

The further away from you I sleep.
Morning, everybody.

We had to help our mom with something.
They've got a mother.

What'd you do with the one you had?
-He traded her for a box of cigars.

We have a father, too.
A mother and a father.
Hey, ain't we the hoi polloi?
So, how's it going today?
Ask me after they put up the headline.
Here it comes now.
"New newsie price. 60 cents per 100."
-What'd you say?

It is to me!
They jacked up the price of papes.
10 cents more 100!
I could eat two days on a dime!
I'll be sleeping on the street.
You already sleep on the street.
-In a worse neighborhood.

All right, what are you all waiting around here for?
Hey, Jack, get a load of this.
Like Pulitzer don't make enough already.
Papes for the newsies!
-Hey, relax.

Hey, good joke, Weasel.

I'll take 100.

100 will cost you 60.
I ain't paying no 60.
Well, then make way for someone who will.
You bet.

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

They upped their price, too.
Then we'll take our business to The Sun.
Same all around town.
New day.

Hey, hey.

Well, for them kind of answers, you gotta ask further up the food chain.
So...
You buying or moving on?
Come here, fellas.
-Get over here.

Hey, why not?

-It's their world.

We got the right to starve.
Let's just get our papes and hit the streets while we still can.
Hey, hey.
-Nobody's paying no new nothing.

Would you keep your shirt on?

-Stop crowding him!

-Let the man work it out!

Hey, Jack, you still thinking?
Sure he is.
Can't you smell smoke?
Hey.

Hurry up.

If we don't sell papes, nobody sells papes.
Nobody gets to that window till they put the price back where it belongs.
What?

Well, hey, you heard Davey, we're on strike!
Hold on.

We shut down this place just like them workers shut down the trolleys.
And the cops will bust our heads.
Half of them strikers is laid up with broke bones.
Cops ain't gonna care about a bunch of kids.

Leave me out of this.

What?

Hey, hey.

It doesn't matter.

What if I says we is?
There's a lot of stuff you gotta have in order to be a union.
Like membership.
What do you call these guys?
Hi!
And officers.
I nominate Jack president!
Gee.

How about a statement of purpose?
Yeah, I must've left that in my other pants.
What's a statement of purpose?
A reason for forming the union.
Well, what reason do the trolley workers have?
I don't know.
Wages, work hours, safety on the job.
Who don't need that?
Hey.
I bet if your father had a union, you wouldn't need to be out here selling papes right now, yeah?
-Yeah.

Our union is hereby formed to watch each other's backs.
Union'd we stand.

I got a pencil.
Well, meet our Secretary of State.
Now what?
If you want a strike, the membership's got to vote.
Okay, so we'll vote.

The choice is yours.
Do we roll over and let Pulitzer pick our pockets or do we strike?
-Strike!

You heard the voice of the membership.
The Newsies of Lower Manhattan are officially on strike.
-Yeah!

Wouldn't our strike be more effective if someone in charge knew about it?
Well, it would be a pleasure to tell Wiesel myself.
And who tells Pulitzer?
-Davey?

-I guess you do, Mr. President.

Hey, we do.
So what...

Well, the newspaper owners need to respect your rights as employees.
Yeah, yeah.

Well, they can't just change the rules when they feel like it!
Yeah, that's right.

-So, we get a say!

We got a union!
Pulitzer and Hearst, they think we're nothing.
-Are we nothing?

They need to understand that we're not enslaved to them.
We are free agents.
Pulitzer and Hearst they think they got us
-Do they got us?

We're a union now.

-and we mean business!

Even though we ain't got hats or badges
We're a union just by saying so
And The World will know
What's to stop some other kids coming along to sell our papes?
-Just let them try!

We cannot beat up on other kids.
-We're all in this together.

What's it gonna take to stop the wagons?
Are we ready?
Yeah!
What's it gonna take to stop the scabbers?
Can we do it?
Yeah!
We'll do what we gotta do until
We break the will of mighty Bill and Joe
And The World will know
And The Journal, too
Mr. Hearst and Pulitzer have we got news for you
See, The World don't know
But they're gonna pay
'Stead of hawking' headlines we'll be makin' 'em today
Hey!
And our ranks will grow
And we'll kick their rear!
Yeah!
And The World will know that we've been here!
When the circulation bell starts ringing
Will we hear it?
No!
What if the Delanceys come out swinging?
Will we hear it?
No!
When ya got 100 voices singing
Who can hear a lousy whistle blow?
And The World will know
That this ain't no game
That we got a ton of rotten fruit and perfect aim
So they gave their word
Well, it ain't worth beans
Now they gonna see what "Stop the presses" really means
And the old will weep and go back to sleep
And we got no choice but to see it through
And we found our voice
And I lost my shoe
And The World will...
-Yeah!

Pulitzer may own The World but he don't own us!
Pulitzer may own The World but he don't own us!
Pulitzer may crack the whip but he won't whip us!
Pulitzer may crack the whip but he won't whip us!
And The World will know
We been keepin' score
Either they gives us our rights
Or we gives them a war
We've been down too long
And we paid our dues
And the things we do today will be tomorrow's news
And the die is cast and the torch is passed
And the roar will rise from the streets below
And our ranks will grow and grow and grow
And so The World will feel the fire
And finally know
And stay out!
You can tell Pulitzer that a few days into this strike, he's gonna be beggin' for an appointment to see me!
You got that?
He got it.
Pulitzer may own The World but he don't own us!
Pulitzer may own The World but he don't own us!
Pulitzer may crack the whip but he won't whip us
Pulitzer may crack the whip but he won't whip us
So The World says, "No!"
Well, the kids do, too!
Come on!
Try to walk all over us we'll stomp all over you!
Can they kick us out?
No.
And take away our vote?
Come on.
Will we let 'em stuff this crock of garbage down our throat?
No!
Every day we wait is a day we lose!
-And this ain't for fun!

And we'll fight 'em toe to toe to toe
And so The World will feel the fire
And finally
Finally know!
And a glass of water for you.
And one for you.
-And you and you and...

Who's the big spender that ordered the seltzer?
Over here.
That'll be 2 cents.
2 cents for a glass of seltzer?
Just give me a water.
How did I ever see that coming?
I'd say we launched our strike in a most auspicious manner.
Yeah.
I don't know about that.
But we sure scared the bejeebers outta Wiesel!
And did you see the Delanceys?

Hey, hey.

Now you have to spread the word.
Let the rest of the city's newsies know about the strike.
Hey, you heard the man.

-I'll take Harlem.

-I got the Bronx.

-Specs, you take Queens.

-Tommy Boy, take the East Side.

And who wants Brooklyn?
Come on.

Spot Conlon's turf.
Finch!
You tellin' me you're scared of Brooklyn?
-I ain't scared of no turf!

But that Spot Conlon gets me a little jittery.
Me and Davey will take Brooklyn.
Me?

Why is everyone so scared of Brooklyn?
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Asking a question.

Brooklyn is the sixth largest city in the entire world.
You got Brooklyn, you hit the mother lode.
Say, for someone who works for The New York Sun, you are spending an awful lot of time hanging around at The World.
So what's that about, huh?

No.

A ragtag gang of ragamuffins wants to take on the king makers of New York?
Well, do you think you have a chance?
Shouldn't you be at the ballet?
Is the question too difficult?

Will the richest and most powerful men in New York give the time of day to a gang of kids who haven't got a nickel to their name?
Hey!

I got a nickel.
So, I guess you'd say you're a couple of Davids looking to take on Goliath.
-We never said that.

I did.
You know, I've seen a lot of papes in my day and I ain't never noted no girl reporters writing the hard news.
Well, wake up to the new century.

Now, how about an exclusive interview?
Ain't your beat entertainment?
This is entertaining.

Hey, what's the last news story you wrote?
What's the last strike you organized?
You're out of your league, Kelly.
Methinks the lady needs to be handled by a...
Real man.
You thinks wrong, Romeo.
-How'd she know my name?

I'd say we save any exclusive for a real reporter.
Well, do you see somebody else giving you the time of day?
All right.

But you give me the exclusive.
Let me run with the story, and I promise I'll get you the space.
Hey, you really think we could be in the papes?
Well, shut down a paper like The World?
You're gonna make the front page.
You want a story?
Be at the circulation gate tomorrow mornin', and you'll get one.
And bring your camera.
You're gonna want to snap a picture of this!
Yeah!
Boys, play outside.

Now, come on!

Hey, you won't be shooing' us off when we get our mugs in the papes!
Yeah!
And The World will know
We been keepin' score
Either they gives us our rights
Or we gives them a war
We've been down too long
And we paid our dues
And the things we do today will be tomorrow's news
And the die is cast
And the torch is passed
-And the roar will rise

And our ranks will grow and grow and grow
And so The World will feel the fire
And finally know!
Hey, come on, Les.

So, what's your story?
Are you selling newspapers to work your way through art school?
Art school?

But you're an artist.
You've got real talent.
You should be inside the paper illustrating, not outside hawking it.
Maybe that ain't what I want.
So tell me what you want.
Can't you see it in my eyes?
Yeah, okay.
Have you always been their leader?
Hey, I'm a blowhard.

Modesty is not a quality I would've pinned on you.
You got a name?
Katherine...

What's the matter?

It's my byline.
-The name I publish under.

So tell me about tomorrow.
What are you hoping for?
I'd rather tell you what I'm hopin' for tonight.
Mr. Kelly...
Today, we stop the newsies from carrying out the papes.
But the wagons still deliver to the rest of the city.
Tomorrow...
We stop the wagons.
Are you scared?
Do I look scared?
But ask me again in the mornin'.
Good answer.
Good night, Mr. Kelly.
Hey!

I'll see you in the morning.
And off the record...
Good luck.
Hey!

Write it good.
We both got a lot riding on you.
You heard the man.
"Write it good."
Write it good or it's back to wheezing your way through the flower show.
No pressure.
Let's go.
"Newsies Stop The World."
A little hyperbole never hurt anyone.
"With all eyes fixed on the trolley strike,
"there's another battle brewing in the city."
And if I could just write about it...
Come on, Katherine!
Those boys are counting on you.
You poor boys.
Write what you know so they say
All I know is I don't know what to write
Or the right way to write it
This is big, lady, don't screw it up
This is not some little vaudeville I'm reviewing
Poor little kids versus rich, greedy sourpusses
Ha!

And let's pray it does
'Cause as I may have mentioned
I have no clue what I'm doing
Am I insane?
This is what I've been waiting for
Well, that, plus the screaming of 10 angry editors
A girl?

Look, just go and get her!
Not only that There's a story behind the story
Thousands of children exploited, invisible
Speak up, take a stand
And there's someone to write about it
That's how things get better
Give life's little guys some ink
And when it dries just watch what happens
Those kids will live and breathe right on the page
And once they're center stage
You watch what happens
And who's there with her camera and her pen
As boys turn into men
They'll storm the gates and then
Just watch what happens when they do
Okay.
"A modern day David is poised to take on the rich and powerful Goliath
"with the swagger of one twice his age.
"Armed with nothing more than a few nuggets of truth,
"Jack Kelly stands ready to face the behemoth Pulitzer."
Now that is how you turn a boy into a legend.
Picture a handsome heroically charismatic
Plain spoken, know-nothing skirt-chasing cocky little son of a...
Lie down with dogs
And you wake up with a raise and a promotion
So, he's a flirt, a complete egomaniac
The fact is he's also the face of the strike, what a face
Face the fact, that's a face that could save us all from sinking in the ocean
Like someone said
"Power tends to corrupt and absolute power..."
Wait!

That is genius!

I'll be twice as good as that
Six months from never
Just look around at the world we're inheriting
And think of the one we'll create
Their mistake is they got old
That is not a mistake we'll be making
No, sir, we'll stay young forever!
Give those kids and me
The brand new century
And watch what happens
It's David and Goliath
Do or die, the fight is on
And I can't watch what happens
But all I know is nothing happens
If you just give in
It can't be any worse
Than how it's been
And it just so happens that we just might win
So whatever happens...
Let's begin!
-Is anyone else comin'?

Hey, well, you've seen Spot Conlon, right?
-What, what'd he say?

Him and about 20 of his gang.
And them Brooklyn boys is big.
And...

-Wasn't he?

All right, so, they're with us?
That all depends on how you look at it.
If you look and see Brooklyn, then they're with us.
Yeah, they wanted proof we weren't gonna fold at the first sign of trouble.
Are we?
We are not!

-There's us, there's Harlem...

Harlem wants to know what Brooklyn's gonna do.
What about Queens?
Queens will be right here backing us up.
As soon as we get the nod from Brooklyn.
I got the same fish-eye in Midtown.
Say, Oscar, it looks like we got bum information about a strike happening' here today.
Not that I'm complaining.
I know my skull-bustin' arm could use a day of rest.
Hey.

Are we doing the right thing?
Sure we are.
Maybe we should put this off a few days.
No, we cannot just put this...
Jack, they are not...
Say something.

Hey, hey!
We can't back down now, all right?
No matter who does or doesn't show.
You like it or not, now is when we take a stand.
How's about we just don't show up for work?
That'll send a message.
No!

They need to see us stand our ground.
-Davey.

-You tell them.

Now is the time to seize the day
Stare down the odds
And seize the day
Minute by minute
That's how you win it
We will find a way
But let us seize the day
Hey, Jack, look what I made.

Strike!
That's great.
That's pitiful.
Don't be so quick to judge.
Maybe Pulitzer will see it out his window and feel sorry for us.
Hey, Specs, any sign of reinforcements?
Davey, Davey, come on.
Courage cannot erase our fear
Courage is when we face our fear
Tell those with power
Safe in their tower
We will not obey
Behold the brave battalion that stands side-by-side
Too few in number
And too proud to hide
Then say to the others
Who did not follow through
You're still our brothers
And we will fight for you
-We doin' this?

Now is the time to seize the day
Stare down the odds and seize the day
Once we've begun, if we stand as one
Someday becomes somehow
And a prayer becomes a vow
And the strike starts
Right damn now!
The sun is up.

It's a beautiful day to crack some heads.
Ain't it?
Step right up and get your papes.
Are you workin' or trespassing'?
What's your pleasure?
-Who are they?

They think they can just waltz in here and take our jobs?
-We can handle them!

No, no, no!

Or we don't have a chance!
-Jack!

Fellas...
I know someone put youse up to this.
Yeah, they probably paid you some extra money, too, huh?
Yeah, well, it ain't right.
Pulitzer thinks we are gutter rats.
With no...

Is that who we are, huh?
Well, we stab each other in the back and, yeah, that's who we are.
But if we stand together, we can change the whole game.
And it ain't just about us!
Yeah, all across the city, there are boys and girls who ought to be out playin' or going to school!
Instead they are slaving' to support themselves and...

Ain't no crime to bein' poor!
No, not a one of us complains if the work we do is hard.
All we ask is a square deal.
For the sake of all the kids in every sweatshop, factory and slaughterhouse in this city,
I beg you, throw down your papers...
And join the strike.
Please?
Hey!

I'm with ya.
Now is the time to seize the day
Now is the time to seize the day
Answer the call and don't delay
Answer the call and don't delay
Wrongs will be righted if we're united!
Let us seize the day!
Yeah!
You're kidding me, right?
Hey, at the end of the day, who are you gonna trust?
Them or them?
Now let 'em hear it loud and clear!
Now let 'em hear it loud and clear!
Like it or not, we're drawing near!
Like it or not, we're drawing near!
Proud and defiant, we'll slay the giant!
Judgment day is here!
What the hell!
My father's gonna kill me anyway!
Yeah!
Houston to Harlem
Look what's begun!
One for all and all for one!
Strike, strike
Strike, strike, strike, strike
Strike, strike, strike, strike
Oh...

-All right, Jack!

All right, come on, Davey!
-Come on, boys!

Show 'em, fellas!
You see this, Mr. Pulitzer?
Come on, fellas.
All right, let's go!

Charge!
Now is the time to seize the day!
They're gonna see there's hell to pay!
Nothing can break us
No one can make us quit before we're done!
One for all and all for
One for all and all for
One for all and all
For one!
Newsies forever!
Second to none
One for all and all for
One for all and all for...
Atta boys!
It's time these kids learned a lesson.
-No, we're not...

Newsies!

Stay down.
Hey!
Get outta here, kid!
It's about time you showed up.
They're slaughtering us.
Cheese it!

-Jack, wait for me!

-Where do you think you're goin'?

Shut it, crip.
Well, it's off to the Refuge with you, little man.
No!

No, please, don't!
How about a little...

And you, take him away.
-Crutchie!

Help!
Folks, we finally got a headline
"Newsies Crushed As Bulls Attack!"
Crutchie's callin' me Dumb crip's just too damn slow
Guys are fightin', bleeding', fallin'
Thanks to good ol' Captain Jack
Captain Jack just wants to close his eyes and go
Let me go
Far away
Somewhere they won't never find me
And tomorrow won't remind me of today
When the city's finally sleepin'
And the moon looks old and gray
I get on the train that's bound for Santa Fe
And I'm gone!

No more runnin', no more lyin'
No more fat old men denying' me my pay
Just the moon so big and yellow
It turns night right into day
Dreams come true
Yeah, they do
In Santa Fe
Where does it say you gotta live and die here?
Where does it say a guy can't catch a break?
Why should you only take what you're given?
Why should you spend your whole life livin'
Trapped where there ain't no future
Even at 17
Breakin' your back for someone else's sake?
If the life don't seem to suit ya
How 'bout a change of scene?
Far from the lousy headlines
And the deadlines in between
Santa Fe!
My old friend
I can't spend my whole life dreamin'
Though I know that's all I seem inclined to do
I ain't getting any younger
And I wanna start brand new
I need space
And fresh air
Let 'em laugh in my face I don't care
Save my place
I'll be there
Just be real is all I'm askin'
Not some painting' in my head
'Cause I'm dead if I can't count on you today
I got nothing if I ain't got
Santa Fe
Hey, drink up, boys.
And don't never say I don't give you nothin'.
And before you say water is nothin', just ask a fish in the desert.
Why do old people talk?
To prove they's still alive.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Would you get a load of these glum mugs.
Wait, can these really be the same boys who made front page of The New York Sun?
Would ya look it!

Where's me?

Wait till my old man gets a load of this!
I won't be last in line for the tub tonight!
-You got us in the paper?

"Newsies Stop The World."
Now there's a headline even Elmer could sell.
So, what else you got?
Mine's the only story that ran.
Pulitzer declared a blackout on strike news, so even I'm shut down now.
Hey, I heard they arrested Crutchie.

The Delanceys are spreading a story that he took it on the lam first sight of the cops.
Jack don't run from no fight.
Take it down, shortstop.
I'm just reporting the news.
For jumping Jack's sake, can you stow the seriosity long enough to just drink in the moment?
I'm famous!
Yeah, what of it?
Well, are you stupid or what?
When you're famous, the world is your erster.
Your what?
Your erster.
What are you saying?
Your erster.
Hey, you know, your fancy clam with the pearl inside.
All right!

No, you don't need money when you're famous.
They gives you whatever you want.
Gratis.
Such as?
A pair of new shoes with matchin' laces
A permanent box at Sheepshead Races
Pastrami on rye with a sour pickle
My personal puss on a wooden nickel
Look at me
I'm the King of New York!
Suddenly
I'm respectable staring right at'cha
Lousy with stature
Nobbin' with all the muckety-mucks
I'm blowin' my dough and going deluxe
And there I be!
Ain't I pretty?

I'm the King of New York
A solid gold watch with a chain to twirl it
My very own bed and a indoor terlet
A barbershop haircut that costs a quarter
A regular beat for the star reporter!
Am-scray, punk!

Who'd'a thunk?

We was sunk, pale and pitiful
Buncha wet noodles
Pulitzer's poodles
Almost about to drown in the drink
-When she fished us out

-So let's get drunk!

Not with liquor, fame works quicker
When you're King of New York
I gotta be either dead or dreamin'
'Cause look at that pape with my face beamin'
Tomorrow they may wrap fishes in it
But I was a star for one whole minute!
Come on, boys!
Yeah!
Got 'em!
That's it?
You gotta be kidding me.
Let's go...
Come on, Katherine!
Look at me I'm the King of New York!
Wait and see
This is gonna make both the Delanceys
Pee in their pant-sies
Flashpots are shootin' bright as the sun!
I'm one highfalutin' son of a gun!
I guarantee
Though I crapped out I ain't tapped out!
I'm the King of New...
Friends may flee, let 'em ditch ya!
Snap one pit'cha!

History!
Front page story, guts and glory
I'm the King...
Of New York!
"Dear Jack...
"Greetings from the Refuge."
How are you?
I'm okay
Guess I wasn't much help yesterday
Snyder soaked me real good with my crutch
Oh, yeah, Jack
This is Crutchie, by the way
These here guards
They is rude
They say jump, boy, you jump or you're screwed
But the food ain't so bad, least so far
'Cause so far they ain't brung us no food
"Ha.

I miss the rooftop
Sleepin' right out in the open
In your penthouse in the sky
There's a cool breeze blowin'
Even in July
Anyway
So, guess what?
There's a secret escape plan I got
Tie a sheet to the bed Toss the end out the window
Climb down then take off like a shot
Maybe though Not tonight
I ain't slept and my leg still ain't right
Hey, but Pulitzer, he's going down!
And then, Jack I was thinking we might just go
Like you was saying
Where it's clean and green and pretty
With no buildings in your way
And you're ridin' palominos every day
Once that train makes...
Damn this place.
I'll be fine
Good as new
But there's one thing I need you to do
On the rooftop, you said
That a family looks out for each other
So you tell all the fellas for me
To protect one another
The end
Your friend
Your best friend
Your brother
Crutchie
All right, enough already.
Here's everything I owe you for the first backdrop.
Plus this one.
And even a little something extra, just account'a because I'm gonna miss you so.
-Miss Medda, I...

You're a gem.
Just tell me you're goin' somewhere, not running away.
Does it matter?
When you go somewhere and it turns out not to be the right place, you can always go somewhere else.
But if you're running away, nowhere is ever the right place.
How about lettin' a pal know you're alive?
Why don't I leave you with your friend.
Where did you go?

You ever think I didn't wanna be found?
Hey, is that a real place?

Hey, did you see the papes?
We are front page news above the fold!
Yes.

Good for you.
Everyone wants to meet the famous Jack Kelly.
Even Spot Conlon sent over a kid just to say,
"Next event you can count on Brooklyn." How about that?
We got stomped into the ground.
Yeah, they got us this time.

But we took round one, and with press like this, our fight is far from over.
Every newsie who could walk was out there this morning, selling papes like the strike never happened.
And I was right out there with them.
If I don't sell papes, my folks don't eat.
Save your breath.

But then I saw this look on Wiesel's face.
He was actually nervous and I realized this isn't over.
We got 'em worried.
Really worried.
And I walked away.
Lots of other kids did, too.
And that is what you call a beginning.
There he is, just like I said.
For cryin' out loud, where's a fella gotta go to get away from you people?
There's no escapin' us, pal.

So, what's the story?

Pipe down.

What's the holdup?
I need to let my girl know we've got a date.
Your girl?
You heard me!
I've been swatting' skirts away all morning.
Fame is one intoxicating potion.
And this here girl, Sally, she's a plum.
Word is, you wrote a great story.
Hey, you look like hell.
Hey, Jack, where's that supposed to be?
It's Santa Fe.
I gotta tell you, Jack.
This "Go west, young man!" routine is getting tired.
Even Horace Greeley moved back to New York.
Yes, he did.
And then he died.
Ain't reporters supposed to be non-partisan?
Ask a reporter?
Pulitzer's had me blacklisted from every news desk in town.
Can we table the palaver and get back to business?
Will Medda let us have the theater?
It's what I been tryin' to tell ya.
We wanna hold a rally, a citywide meeting where every newsie gets a say and a vote.
And...
We do it after working hours so no one loses a day's pay.
Smart?
Yeah, smart enough to get you committed to a padded room.
The guy who paints places he's never seen is calling us crazy?
You wanna see a place I seen, huh?
How about this?
Newsie Square, thanks to my big mouth, filled to overflowing with failure.
Kids hurt, others arrested!
Lighten up.

Is that what you're aimin' for?
No, no, go on.
Call me a coward.

Ain't no way I'm puttin' them kids back in danger.
We're doing something that's never been done before!
How could that not be dangerous?
Specs brung me a note from Crutchie at the Refuge.
I tried to go see him.

They busted him up so bad, he couldn't even come to the window.
Now, what if he don't make it, huh?
Are you...

For what, half a penny a pape?
It's not about pennies, Jack!
You said it yourself.
My family wouldn't be in the mess we're in if my father had a union.
This is a fight we have to win!
If I wanted a sermon, I would show up for church.
Tell me how quitting does Crutchie any good.
Exactly.
So here's how it goes once we win
And we will be winning Make no mistake
-We'll be what?

-Oh, right

They let Crutchie go or they keep getting pounded
Oh, Dave What the hell?
Did they bust up your brains or somethin'?
As I recall, Dave we all got our asses kicked
-They won!

-Oh, come on!

We got them surrounded
And here's where I think Joe's a jerk
-He's a rattlesnake

And you know why a snake starts to rattle?
-No.

-Oh, sure

The poor guy's head is spinning
Why would he send for the goons?

Dozens of goons plus the cops and...
-You know, you may be right

-If he wasn't afraid

He knows we're winning
Get those kids to see
We're circling victory
And watch what happens
We're doing something no one's even tried
And, yes, we're terrified
But watch what happens
You can't undo the past
So just move on
And stay on track
Stay on track
'Cause Humpty Dumpty is about to crack
We've got faith
We've got the plan
And we've got Jack
So just watch what happens
We're back
And I've got a date!
But I've read your editorials, Mr. Pulitzer.
How can you express so much sympathy for the trolley workers and yet have none for the newsies?
Because the trolley workers are striking for a fair contract.
The newsies are striking against me.
I'd spare you this embarrassment if I could.
But the Burlesque House is private property.
He can't order a raid without legal cause.
Mr. Mayor, would the fact that this rally is organized by an escaped convict be cause enough to shut it down?
An escaped convict?
A fugitive from one of your own institutions.
A convicted thief at large, wreaking mischief on our law-abiding community.
Mr. Snyder, which one is he?
That is him, there.
-Jack Kelly.

His is not a pleasant story.
He was first sentenced to my Refuge for loitering and vagrancy.
But his total disregard for authority has made him a frequent visitor.
You called him a thief and escaped convict.
After his release,
I caught him myself, red-handed, trafficking stolen food and clothing.
He was last sentenced to six months, but the willful ruffian escaped.
So you'd be doing the city a service.
Removing this criminal from our streets.
If that's the case, we can take him in quietly.
What good would quiet do me?
I want a public example made of him.
Mr. Pulitzer...
The boy, Jack Kelly, is here.
-Here?

He's asked to see you.
Ask and ye shall be received.
Mr. Snyder, if you please.
Sit.
Mr. Jack Kelly.
Hey.

And which Jack Kelly is this?
The charismatic union organizer, or the petty thief and escaped convict?
Which one gives us more in common, huh?
Impudence is in bad taste when crawling for mercy.
Crawlin'?
That's a laugh.

No, I just stopped by with an invite.
No, it seems a few hundred of your employees are rallyin' to discuss some recent disagreements.
Now, I thought it only fair to invite you to state your case direct to the fellas.
So what do you say, Joe?
Want I should save you a spot on the bill?
You are as shameless and disrespectful a creature as I was told.
Did you know what I was doing when I was your age, boy?
I was fighting in a war.
Yeah, how'd that turn out for ya?
It taught me a lesson that shaped my life.
You don't win a war on the battlefield.
It's the headline that crowns the victor.
Well, I will keep that in mind when New York wakes up to front page photos of our rally.
Rally till the cows come home.
Not a paper in town will publish a word.
And if it's not in the papers, it never happened.
You may run this city, but there are some of us who cannot be bullied.
Even some reporters.
Such as that young woman who made you yesterday's news.
Talented girl.
And beautiful as well, don't you think?
Yeah.

No need.

Can't you, darling?
I trust you know my daughter, Katherine.
Yes.

You're probably asking, why the nom de plume?
Why doesn't my daughter work for me?
Good questions.
I offered Katherine a life of wealth and leisure.
Instead, she chose to pursue a career.
And she was showing real promise until this recent lapse.
But you're done with all of that now, aren't you, sweetheart?
-Jack, I didn't mean...

Don't trouble the boy with your problems, dearest.
Mr. Kelly has a plateful of his own.
Would you say so, Mr. Snyder?
Hello, Jack.
Does anyone else feel a noose tightening?
But allow me to offer an alternate scenario.
You attend this rally and you speak against this hopeless strike.
And I'll see your criminal record expunged.
And your pockets filled with enough cash to carry you in a first-class train compartment from New York to New Mexico and beyond.
You did say he wanted to travel west, didn't you?
There ain't a person in this room that don't know you stink.
And if they know me, they know I don't care.
Mark my words, boy.
Defy me, and I'll have you and every one of your friends locked up in the Refuge.
Now, I know...
I know that you are Mr. Tough Guy.
But it's not right to condemn that little crippled boy to conditions like that.
-And what about your pal...

Davey and his baby brother ripped from their loving family and tossed to the rats.
Will they ever be able to thank you enough?
Time's running out, kid So what do you say?
Cowboy or convict
I win either way
Your abject surrender
Was always the bottom line
Gentlemen, escort our guest to the cellar so he might reflect in solitude.
Too bad you've no job, Jack but you did resign
Too bad you've no family but you can't have mine
Be glad you're alive, boy I'd say that's the bottom line
Like the pied piper
You knew what to play
Till those kids all believed you were right
Lucky for them all but one got away
They may not be so lucky tonight
And now, we've been given discretion to handle you as we see fit.
Yeah, so behave.
But just in case,
I been polishin' my favorite brass knuckles.
You can sleep right here on this old printing' press.
Now that there is firm.
Newsies need our help today Newsies need our help today
Tell 'em Brooklyn's on their way
Tell 'em Brooklyn's on their way
We're from Brooklyn We are newsies
We are Brooklyn newsies
Just got word that our buddies is hurtin'

That's our cue, boys it's time to go slummin'
Hey, Manhattan, the cavalry's comin'

You know we've got your back from way back
Brooklyn's here
We'll get your pay back with some payback
We're the boys from the beaches of Brighton
Prospect Park and the Navy Yard Pier
Strikes ain't fun but they sure is excitin'
Loud and clear

Borough what gave me birth
Friendliest place on Earth
Pay us a visit and see what we means
-And when ya do

Loud and clear
Manhattan's here
Flushing's here
Richmond's here
Woodside's here
So's the Bronx!
-Brooklyn's here

We is here
Welcome, newsies of New York City.
Welcome to my theater and your revolution!
And let's hear it for Spot Conlon and Brooklyn!
Newsies united!
Let's see what Pulitzer's gotta say to you now.
Hey, Davey.
Where's Jack?
Jack!

Sorry, kid.

Looks like you're doin' a solo.
-I can't.

All right.
Newsies of New York!
Look at what we done.
We got newsies from every pape and every neighborhood here tonight.
Tonight, you're makin' history.
Tonight, we declare that we are just as much a part of the newspaper as any reporter or editor.
We are done being treated like kids.
From now on, they will treat us as equals!
All right?
You wanna be talked to like an adult?
Start actin' like one.
-Jack.

-Make some sense.

Jack!

All right, all right.
All right!
Pulitzer...
Raised the price of papes without so much as a word to us and that was a lousy thing to do.
So we got mad and we showed 'em we ain't gonna be pushed around.
So we go on strike.

Well, Pulitzer lowers the price of papes, so's we'll go back to work!
And then a few weeks after that, he hikes up his price again, and don't think he won't.
So what do we do then?
And what do we do when he decides to raise his price again after that?
Fellas, we gotta be realistic here.
If we don't work, we don't get paid.
How many days can you go without making money?
Believe me, however long, Pulitzer can go longer.
But I have spoken with Mr. Pulitzer.
And he...
He has given me his word.
If we disband the union, he will not raise prices again for two years.
He will even put that in writing.
Now I say, we take the deal.
We go back to work knowing our price is secure.
All you gotta do is vote "No."
Vote "No"!
He's a sellout.
-Hey!

You're a traitor, Jack!
Davey.
That was some speech you made.
-How'd you get here?

What?

I saw them rolled up sticking out of there.
I didn't know what they were.
These drawings...
These are drawings of the Refuge, aren't they?
Is this really what it's like in there?
Three boys to a bed, rats everywhere and vermin...
What?

Snyder told my father that you were arrested stealing food and clothing.
This is why, isn't it?
You stole to feed those boys.
I don't understand!
If you are willing to go to jail for those boys, how could you turn your back on them now?
I do not think you are one to talk about turning' on folks!
I never turned on you or anyone else.
No, you didn't.
You just double-crossed us to your father!
Your father!
My father has eyes on every corner of this city.
He doesn't need me spying for him.
And I never lied.
I didn't tell you everything.
If you weren't a girl, you would be trying to talk with a fist in your mouth.
I told you that I worked for The Sun and I did.
I told you my professional name is Plumber and it is.
You never asked my real one.
I wouldn't think I had to unless I knew I was dealing with a backstabber!
And if I was a boy, you'd be looking at me through one swollen eye!
Yeah?

Give me your best shot!
I need to know that you didn't cave for the money.
No, I spoke the truth.
You win a fight when you got the other fellow down eating' pavement.
All right, you heard your father.
No matter how many days we strike, he ain't never givin' up.

I don't know what else we can do.
-But I do.

Really, Jack, really?
Only you can have a good idea?
-Or is it because I'm a girl?

This would be a good time to shut up.
Being boss doesn't mean you have all the answers.
Just the brains to recognize the right one when you hear it.
I'm listening.
Good for you.
The strike was your idea.

And now my plan will take us to the finish line.
Deal with it.
"The Children's Crusade."
"For the sake of all the kids in every sweatshop, factory
"and slaughterhouse in New York,
"I beg you, join us."
This...
With those words, the strike stopped being just about the newsies.
You challenged our whole generation to stand up and demand a place at the table.
Children's Crusade...
Think, Jack, if we publish this, my words with one of your drawings, and if every worker under 21 read it and stayed home from work, or better yet, they came to Newsie Square.
A general citywide strike!
Even my father couldn't ignore that.
We have one small problem.
We got no way to print it.
Come on, there has to be one printing press he doesn't control.
-No.

I know where there's a printing press no one would ever think we'd use.
Well, then, why are we still standing here?
Hey, hey.

What is this about for you?
Nah, and I'm not talkin' about the Children's Crusade.
What's this about?
What, am I...
Am I kiddin' myself or is there somethin'...
Of course, there is.
Well, don't just say it like it happens every day!
-Jack, I didn't...

Look, I know girls like you don't wind up with guys like me.
And I don't want you promising' nothin' you're just gonna take back later.
Standin' here...
Tonight, lookin' at you, I...
Look, I'm scared tomorrow's gonna come and change everything.
If there was a way I could grab hold of somethin'...
Just to make time stop, so's I could just keep on lookin' at you.
You snuck up on me, Jack Kelly.
I never even saw it coming.
For sure?
For sure.
Till the moment I found you
I thought I knew what love was
Now I'm learning what is true
That love will do what it does
The world finds ways to sting you
And then, one day decides to bring you
Something to believe in
For even a night
One night may be forever
But that's all right
That's all right
And if you're gone tomorrow
What was ours still will be
I have something to believe in
Now that I know you believed in me
We was never meant to meet
And then we meet
Who knows why
One more stranger on the street
Just someone sweet passing by
An angel come to save me
Who didn't even know she gave me
Somethin' to believe in
For even a day
One day may be forever
But that's okay
That's okay
And if I'm gone tomorrow
What was ours still will be
I have something to believe in
Now that I know you believed in me
Do you know what I believe in?
Look into my eyes
And see
If things were different...
If you weren't going to Santa Fe...
Yeah, if you weren't an heiress...
And if your father wasn't after my head.
But you're not really scared of my father.
No.
I am pretty scared of you.
Don't be!
And if I'm gone tomorrow
What was ours still will be
I have something to believe in
Now that I know you believed in me
I have somethin' to believe in
Now that I know you believed
In me
Now is the time to seize the day
Stare down the odds and seize the day
Minute by minute, that's how you win it
We will find a way
But let us seize the day
I'll get the lights.

We've got enough keys here for the entire building.
Hey, has someone being picking' Daddy's pockets?
The janitor's been working here since he was eight and hasn't had a raise in 20 years.
He's with us 100%.
Hey, you bring enough fellas to keep us covered?
We can hold a hoedown in here and no one would be the wiser.
All right, good job.
Hey.
It's good to have you back again.
Shut up.
Here she is, boys.
Now just think, while my father snores blissfully in his bed, we will be using his very own press to bring him down.
Yeah, remind me to stay on your good side.
Hey, is this what they print the papes on?
I can see why they tossed this old girl down to the cellar.
But I think she'll do the job.
Jack, this is Darcy.
He knows just about everything there is to know about printing.
I'm sorry.
You work for one of the papes?
My father owns The Trib.
Whoa.

And this is Bill.

Bill?

Yeah.

Ain't that somethin'?
In the words of the little one,
"Can we table the palaver and get back to business?"
A little grease, and she'll be good as gold.
All right, here's how it'll work.
As we print the papes, Race, you'll let the fellas in and they'll spread 'em to every working' kid in New York.
-After that...

There's change comin'
Once and for all
You makes the front page
And, man, you is major news
Tomorrow they'll see what we are
And sure as a star
We ain't come this far
To lose
-Let's go, boys!

Right, bring 'em in!
-Let's go, boys!

This is the story we needed to write
As we're kept out of sight, but no more
In a few hours, by dawn's early light
We'll be ready to fight us a war
This time, we're in it to stay
Talk about seizing the day
Write it in ink or in blood
It's the same either way
They're gonna damn well pay!
See old man Pulitzer snug in his bed
He don't care if we're dead or alive
Three satin pillows are under his head
While we's begging for bread to survive
Joe, you can stop counting sheep
We're gonna sing ya to sleep
You've got your thugs with their sticks and their slugs
Yeah!

Once and for all if they don't mind their manners
We'll bleed 'em
Bleed 'em
Once and for all we won't carry no banners
That don't spell
Freedom!
Finally, we's raising the stakes
This time, whatever it takes
This time, the union awaits
Once and for all!
"In the words of union leader, Jack Kelly..."
"'We will work with you, we will even work for you,
"'but we will be paid
"'and treated as valuable members of your organization.'"
Riveting stuff, huh?
Hey, get goin'.

Well, keep your fingers crossed, okay?
For us, too.
This is for kids shining shoes on the street
With no shoes on their feet every day
This is for guys sweating blood in the shops
While their bosses and cops look away
I'm seeing kids standing tall
Glaring and raring to brawl
Armies of guys who are sick of the lies
Getting ready to rise to the call!
Once and for all there'll be blood on the wall
If they doubt us
They think they're running this town
But this town will shut down without us
Ten thousand kids in the square
Ten thousand kids in the square
-Ten thousand fists in the air

Joe, you is gonna play fair
Once and for all!
-Once and for all

-Once and for all

-Once and for all

There's change coming once and for all
You're getting too old
Too weak to keep holding on
A new world is gunning for you
And, Joe, we is, too!
Till once and for all
You're gone!
Come on, boys!
Once and for all
Once and for all
Once and for all
Once and for all
I'm sorry, Mr. Pulitzer will have to call you back.
No, he's very busy.

He can't talk.

Mr. Pulitzer's office.

I'm sorry, Mr. Pulitzer's simply not available.
Well, I'm sorry!

Silence those phones!
The entire city is...
Sorry.
The entire city is shut down.
No one is working anywhere, and everyone is blaming you!
They're all calling.
The mayor, the publishers, the manufacturers.
And such language.
You can't just barge in here!
Mornin', gents!
You're behind this.
We had a deal.
And it came with a money-back guarantee.
And thank you for your lesson on the powers of the press.
Did you read this, boss?
These kids put out a pretty good paper.
Very convincing.
No doubt written by my daughter.
I would sign her before somebody else grabs her.
I demand to know who defied my ban on printing strike material.
No, we're your loyal employees.
We would never take our business elsewhere.
That old printing press in the cellar.
I made you the offer of a lifetime.
Anyone who does not act in his own self-interest is a fool.
What's that make you?
This all began because you wanted to sell more papers.
But now your circulation is down 70%.
Why didn't you just come talk to us?
'Cause guys like Joe don't talk to nobodies like us.
But a very wise reporter told me,
"A real boss don't need all the answers." Nah.
"Just the smarts enough to snatch up the right one when he hears it."
Now is the time to seize the day
Stare down the odds and seize the day
Minute by minute, that's how you win it
We will find a way
But let us seize the day
Have a look out there, Mr. Pulitzer.
In case you ain't figured it out, we got you surrounded.
New York is closed for business.
Paralyzed.
You can't get a paper or a shoe shine.
You can't send a message, ride an elevator or cross the Brooklyn Bridge.
Hell, you can't even get out of your own office.
So, what's your next move?
Mr. Pulitzer, the mayor is here along with your daughter.
And you won't believe who else.
Good morning, Mr. Pulitzer.

Governor Roosevelt?
Joseph, Joseph, Joseph.

I'm certain when you hear my explanation, you'll know exactly...
Thanks to Miss Medda Larkin bringing your daughter to my office,
I already have a thorough grasp of the situation.
Graphic illustrations included.
"Bully" is the expression I usually employ to show approval.
But in your case, I simply mean...
Bully.
And is this the boy of whom you spoke?
How are you, son?
I'm told we once shared a carriage ride!
The pleasure is mine, Mr. Governor.
My, God...
Well, Joe, don't just stand there, letting those children sing...
Endlessly.

What good news?
That you've come to your senses and rolled back prices.
Unless, of course, you want to invite a full state Senate investigation into your employment practices.
You wouldn't dare.
After the pressure you wielded to keep me from office...
I'd do it with a smile.
Come along, Joseph, there's only one thing worse than a hard heart.
And that's a soft head.
And think of the happiness you'll bring those children.
He doesn't do happiness, does he?
Mr. Kelly...
If I may speak to you.

Don't worry.

"Keep your eyes on the stars, and your feet on the ground."
You can do this.
I cannot put the price back where it was.
I'm sorry.

-There are other considerations...

Joe, you need to save face in front of all these other folks.
-I'm young.

But I got constituents with a legitimate gripe!
What if I reduced the raise by half?
And get the others to do the same.
It's a compromise we can all live with!
But you eat our losses.
From now on, any pape we can't sell, you buy back.

That was never on the table!
What's to stop the newsies from taking hundreds of papers they cannot sell?
My cost would explode!
No newsie's gonna break his back hauling around papes he can't sell!
But if he can take a few extra with no risk, he might sell them and then your circulation will begin to grow!
"It's a compromise we can all live with!"
That's not a bad head you've got on your shoulders.
Deal?
That's disgusting.
Well, that's just the price of doing business.
And The World will know
We been keepin' score
Either they gives us our rights
Or we gives them a war
We've been down too long and we paid our dues
And the things we do today will be tomorrow's news
And the die is cast and the torch is passed
-And the roar will rise

And our ranks will grow and grow
And grow and grow and grow and grow and...
Newsies of New York City.
We won!
And now I would like to introduce my very own personal pal,
Governor Theodore Roosevelt himself!
Each generation must, at the height of its power, step aside and invite the young to share the day.
You have laid claim to our world and I believe the future, in your hands, will be bright and prosperous!
Your drawing, son, brought another matter to bear.
Officers!

Hey, Jack, look.

Hiya, fellas!

Yeah!
And look what I got for youse, a gift.

All right, bring him in, fellas.
It's Snyder the Spider.
He ain't lookin' so tough no more.
Jack, with those drawings, you've made an eloquent argument for shutting down the Refuge.
Be assured that Mr. Snyder's abuses will be fully investigated.
Officers, take him away!
Please, Your Highness, may I do the honors?
You have got to be joking.
Yeah, and you'll be laughin' all the way to the pen, little man.
So long, sucker!
Thank you, Governor.
I can't help thinking, if one of your drawings convinced the governor to shut down the Refuge, what might a daily political cartoon do to expose the dealings in our own government's back rooms?
What do you say, Teddy?
Care to let this young man's artistry shine a lantern behind your closed doors?
Don't sweat it, Gov.
I mean, with the strike settled,
I should be hittin' the road.
Don't you ever get tired of singing the same old tune?
What's Santa Fe got that New York ain't?
Tarantulas?
Better yet, what's New York got that Santa Fe ain't?
New York's got us, and we're family.
Did I not hear something about the strike being settled?
Papes for the newsies.

These papes ain't gonna sell themselves.
Come along, Governor.
And show me that backseat I've been hearing so much about.
Well, don't just stand there.

Besides, didn't someone just offer you a pretty exciting job?
What?

Well, you already work for my father.
Yeah.
And you've got one more ace up your sleeve.
And what would that be?
Me.
Wherever you go, I'm there.
Right by your side.
For sure?
For sure.
It don't take much to be a dreamer
All you do is close your eyes
But some made-up world is all you ever see
Now my eyes is finally open
And my dreams, they's average size
But they don't much matter if you ain't with me
Guys!
Whoa!
Atta boy, Jack Kelly!
Well, Jack, are you in or you out?
Come on.
I mean, I've been busy, right?
Yeah!
We'll all be out there
Carryin' the banner man to man
We're always out there
Soakin' ev'ry sucker that we can
Here's the headline
"Newsies on a Mission!" Kill the competition!
Sell the next edition!
We'll be out there carrying' the banner
See us out there carrying' the banner
Always out there carrying' the banner
Look at me I'm the King of New York
Suddenly I'm respectable
Staring right at'cha Lousy with stature
Glory be I'm the King of New York
Victory
Front page story Guts and glory
I'm the King
Of New York!
Newsies of New York!
-Let's go!
