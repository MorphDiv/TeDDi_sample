I'm getting an iguana.
What are you talking about?
(crickets chirping)
I was so excited I just ran out of there.
Stan, you jerk!
That was the jam I got at Colonial Williamsburg!
Now I have to go back, and it's so boring!
Well, if something's that important to you, maybe put a note on it!
Oven's clean.
I feel like I'm always screwing up with Francine.
You're like a wire that's been wound around a thing super tight.
You got to cut loose.
Well, let's do it.
You're my boy, and I'm always here to help.
Sorry, I'm kind of down to the dregs, but we'll make it work.

Okay.
The cheapest Faberge egg is $79,000?
He's worth it.
Can I get that with a side of bejeweled hash browns?
(laughs) Nothing.
Guess you're all business down there in Clearwater, huh?
Okay, Stan Smith.
Visa 481...
We both agreed I look better in them.
"Stan, do not drink." (gasps)
Was this on Francine's wine?
Oh, God, this is so much worse than the jam!
You know what I love about going to the movies?
Turning my phone back on.
My favorite part is clapping at random credits like I'm a Hollywood insider.
That's what Barry does.
He claps for the Grips.
My friend, Barry.
You're telling me you've never met Barry?
Just think, you got to know Barry.
I am thinking, Steve.
All I do is think.
Um...
Snot's not for everyone, but Barry...
Barry's for you.
This has to happen.
Think I forgot my hoodie in the theater.
Enjoy these last few days of being Jeff who doesn't know Barry.
What if I do too much and ruin everything?
You know, I'm gonna be hands off.
Let nature take its course.
But... sometimes, nature needs... a little push.
(sips)
There are many ways to play this.
The wine's out of stock everywhere.
The vineyard doesn't even exist anymore.
I'm screwed.
Francine will never forgive me for drinking that wine.
Have you seen "The Martian"?
If Matt Damon can grow potatoes out of his own feces, we can do this, especially if we already had some of Matt Damon's feces.
(rattles)
It's dry because it's from "School Ties."
Can't have Francine knowing what we're up to.
This way, whenever she looks out the window, she'll think you're practicing basketball.
You don't play basketball on the lawn.
How about we say I'm playing "grassketball"?
Deal.
Say hello to me, Mario Vincent Sangervasi.
How are we gonna make an exact replica of Francine's wine?
We're gonna make it exactly the same way it was made the first time.
Same vine, same soil, imported from France.
- (thunder rumbles) - _
On this day, it was sunny, so we're gonna find some sun.
Two best buds following the weather, wherever it takes us...

Hey, babe, hey, I'm gonna be spending what looks like a significant amount of time working on my jump shot in the backyard.
I ask that you please not disturb me and trust that I will come out the other side a reliable shooting guard for this family.
(cellphone beeps)
♪
Who would've thought the weather in the Loire Valley on this day in July could be exactly replicated behind a Waffle House dumpster in Fort Worth.
And that affects the vine?
It all affects the vine.
And Cher's "If I Could Turn Back Time"
was at the top of the charts when our wine was made.
Can the vine see your outfit?
This is for you.
(gasps)
Oh, is my dick showing, like Cher's did?
No, there's a tornado!
Yeah, that's why we're here, silly.
(tires squeal)
A twister hit the vines in '89!
It whipped them around real good.
Only the sweetest grapes were left on the vine.
(wind howling, tires screech)
This is the big mama, Stan.
We got to secure the truck!
Roger, the vine!
Stan, the Roger!
(truck creaks)
Roger, it seems like we might die here.
You were just trying to help me out.
I'm sorry it ended up like this.
It's okay.
You would've done the same for me.
Uh-huh.
Hey, Stan.
Couldn't help but notice you took a little pause there.
W-Would you do this for me?
Um...
No.
No, probably not.
Oh.
Well, you've hurt me terribly, so... (cries)

There's a corpse in here!

Sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.
You're here to buy dried flowers.
Anything here catch your eye?
It's an all-too-perfect reminder of a past I never want to remember.
I couldn't part with it.
Now, let's get you some dried flowers.
I have some peonies that are very dry, and some tulips that are quite dry, as well.
Do you have any dry roses?
My roses are like bones in a desert.
Oh, I haven't had a bone in my desert in years.
Damn, old lady!
How's he shooting?
That's our guy.
Hey, what're you guys doing here?
You were supposed to give him a bath last night!
And you were supposed to go to the mall!
I didn't want to go by myself.

I'm Jesse.
You must be Julia.
It's very nice to finally meet you.
Put the whole idea out of your head.
It'll never happen.
You're just a silly handsome fool.
And don't try to follow me or my flowers.
Oh, I ran out.
Well, then definitely don't try to follow me or my trail of Miller Lite tall boys.
(cans clattering)
(laughs)
So, why dried flowers?
I think it's inspiring that something once so vibrant and full of life can still be delicately beautiful even after so many terrible things have happened to me.
Sounds like dried flowers are a little like you.
(scoffs) That seems like a stretch.
I can't believe that Stan fella.
If I ever get my hands on him... (exhales slowly)
Oh, Jesse.
Oh, Julia.
Would you go to the harvest festival with me?
You're sweet as fudge, Jesse, but I'm just not ready to get back out there.
Aren't you awfully lonely?
Oh, I have Percy, my service rooster.
We look out for each other.
And of course I have my vine.
Your vine is dying, Julia.
Let me plant it in my field, nurture it, keep it safe until it's strong again.
How much is that gonna set me back?
I wasn't gonna charge you.
Oh, well, that's really generous of you.
Your half of the fudge is six bucks.
I... brought you that fudge.
(laughs)
Oh, Jesse.
(circus theme plays)
Is that dance still available?
More just rides and games and stuff.
Well, if we're not gonna dance, then I want fried butter.

(dings)
Just like Minions, but more fun.
When you touch them, you can feel the shredded Chinese newspaper inside.
Babies love the sound.
I like the sound of the bell.
Jesse, I want the bell.
Without the bell, my family starves!
I beg you!
Please take a Rastafarian Munion!
(laughing) Oh!
My bell!

I've escaped my old life and all the horrible darkness of my past is behind me forever!

I'd like to test my strength.
Oh, I don't work here.

Hold daddy's butter.
You're going back to your mom's house with a Munion.

I respect that.
So, you can either do it on my back or my feet.
Dealer's choice.
Goodnight, sweet Julia!
(engine starts)
Jesse, get back here, you stupid farm boy!
Jesse, Jesse, Jesse.
Damn clicking will be the end of me.
(clicking fades)
Ahh.
(Percy caws)
Percy?
Percy?
Jesse?
(gasps) Stan!
(bawks)
How'd you track me down?
You kept sending me postcards about how happy you are now and how much you like your new friends better than me, and then you sent me driving directions to your house.
And you just had to come and beg my forgiveness and tell me how much you appreciate me, how much you miss me, and how much you want me back.
Well, obviously you'll stop at nothing, so I might as well pack my bags and get to know this new you you keep talking so much about.
Now, it's gonna take me some time to forgive you completely.
I'm there. 100% forgiven.
Roger, that's enough!
(door slams)
And you brought the whole town, perfect.
Go give him the country business.
Oh, this guy's got, like, a scepter.
That's cool.
Now, here's something I can't figure.
Why are these fine folks putting on crow masks?
To honor the Crow God!
Now drive me to safety, benevolent mob.
(all cheering)
We gather to make a sacrifice to the Crow God.
"You're gonna do this right now?"
You're just mad 'cause you're not head Crow guy.

♪
No, I get it, Stan.
I get that they're trying to kill me.
It was just hard for me to give up the dream of you getting worked over by a bunch of country bumpkins.
I'd like to see them try.
I would've been all like, "Bam, bam!
Second floor, Stan!
(imitating gunfire)
Have some of mine.
(imitates gun cocking)
Just in case.
This is crazy.
Jeff and Barry have been in there so long.
Well, what if they don't hit it off?
This is the first time Jeff and Barry have met.
They have a lot of ground to cover.
I think it's a good sign.
We don't know what it is!
We haven't heard peep one out of them!
We heard that sneeze a while ago.
But no "Bless you."
Oh, that is true.
He hasn't been feeling well.
(wind blowing)
(mocking) "Maybe a cough."
Maybe it was a unicorn farting its way over the rainbow.
Am I the only one not living in a fantasy world?
You got this guy swimming around smiling, playing with his bubbles like an asshole!
Hey, man, I was playing with the bubbles for like one second.
No one wants Barry and Jeff to happen more than me.
It's gorilla time.
Aah!
Aaaaah!
Let him go!
This has been a long time coming.
My babies are gonna kill each other!

Jeff and I have decided... to do a project together.
Oh, yeah!

Everybody wins!

(bell dings)
(bell dings)
No one on earth would ever come in here.
(sighs) This is my shop.
What?
Well, this is the first place they'll look.
I wanted you to see it.
I put a lot of work into transforming this place.
Can you believe it was a frame shop before?
But I've utterly erased all memory of that.
Now when people think of 24 Main Street, they think about one thing... buying and selling dried flowers.
I also sell PlayStation controllers.
(pounding on door)
They're inside the old frame shop!
Son of a bitch.
(bell dings, crashing)
Sorry I got you into this, Stan.
I was all hung up on how far you would go for me.
And all you wanted was to make things right with Francine.
And all you needed was this.
I don't even need this.
I slapped a fake label on a bottle of Diet Rite.
Francine said it was, and I quote,
"The best wine she's ever had in her life."
(pounding on door)
If you didn't need the vine, then... then why did you come here?
For you, to bring you home.
But in the tornado, you said you wouldn't...
It's hard for me to talk about my feelings.
I'll do it for you.
Just give my hand a little squeeze if I'm barking up the right tree.
You care about me, Stan.
You would go to great trouble for me.
Okay, we're getting somewhere.
Our friendship is so profound, it's like a love.
Aww.
Our love is developing a sexual component?
(glass shatters)
Oh, I felt something.
I flinched 'cause of the brick.
Riiiight.
To our unconsummated friendship.
To getting loose before we get murdered by crow people.
(glasses clink)
There were only four grapes, so I topped it off with gasoline and a little bit of nitroglycerine... for the tannins.
That's what gives it its legs.
And it pairs well with fudge.
I'll just nip on over to the fudge shop.
Hold up, what's this?
It's my secret tunnel to the fudge shop.
I can't believe you didn't mention this.
Hey, I'm not particularly proud of stealing fudge, Stan.
But I am proud of my tunnel.
Doesn't feel like a tunnel, more like a lovely hallway.
(pounding on door)
(bell dings)
(mob shouting)
(classical music plays)
I'm starting to question if there even is a Crow God.
Look, a sign from the Crow God.
I never doubted you!
(explosion)
Whoa.
This fudge is amazing.
You should meet the lady who makes it.
Oh, here she comes.
