Previously on "How To Get Away With Murder"...
Here.

Your friends aren't your family, Micky.
I remember you showing up messed up the night of the bonfire.
I wasn't high, Oli.

Traumatized from what?
Like you don't already know.
- Hello?

His attorney's calling him down here right now.
Land him.
We'd like Wes to cooperate in an ongoing investigation.
A body was found in the woods.
- Rebecca Sutter.

Wes, come to the house right away.
Annalise?
No, no!
Wipe it clean.
Everything on it.
The official charge...

The evidence?
An anonymous source.
Laurel's pregnant.
- Who's dead?

He was already dead, before the fire.
I didn't do this.
- You're not gonna let me get it at all?

Hey!

I, uh...

What internship?
To work with undocumented immigrants?
Oh, right.

Yeah.
Oh.
I take it that's Meggy?
Yeah.
What?
She looks like she wants an introduction.
Oh.

That would be weird, right?
Uh, totally.
Just tell her I have a meeting.
Got it.
Hey.
Congratulations on the internship.
Thanks.
Keating.

You're getting out of here.
I'm being released?
No, we're transferring you to county till your bail hearing.
Up and at 'em.
Tilt your head forward.

Open your mouth.
These are yours and yours alone to take care of.
If you lose or destroy any property in your cell, you will receive a fine.
Hi.
Everyone's in the waiting area.
They want to see you, but the doctors would only let me in.
I told them I was your lawyer.
Oh.
Wes died before the fire.
The M.E. told me.
Did you see anything before the explosion?
Mm.
I know you're in pain, but the detectives will be here soon.
Good.
I want to tell them who did it.
- Frank.

Where is he, then?
I want to ask him to his face.
You know he would never hurt any of us.
Of course he would.
Leave.
If you tell the police, it will hurt all of us.
Leave, or I'll tell them everything.
How is she?
Okay.
Can we see her?
The doctor said she's too weak.
Does she remember anything?
No.

I'll call Meggy, see if she can get us in.
Don't.
She needs to be with people right now.
She needs sleep.
Or you just don't want us to see her.
You're scared that we might find out what actually happened.
No one knows what happened.
The police seem pretty confident that this was Annalise.
Someone's framing her.
And this is not the place to talk about it.
Go home.

I will call you once I know anything.
Where are you going?
To see Annalise.
Just... tell her I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
No.
You should come back with us.
I think I'm just gonna go home.
Ol, it's not healthy to be alone right now.
No, I...

Laurel thinks it was you.
- And what do you think?

You think I'd do this to Annalise?
After everything?
I don't know what to think anymore.
We know who did this.
It's the Mahoneys.
They must have found out Wes is Wallace's son, that you knew him.
They have money to make whatever they need happen.
Annalise?
Doesn't matter who did it.
Only person locked up is me.
Your ball hearing is tomorrow at 2:00.
I called Helen Hughes.

Eve would be a conflict of interest.
Everyone's a conflict of interest.
You have to do this.
No.
I will find someone you trust.
- Bonnie.

We're under attack here.
It has to be you.
Are you sure?
I showed you.
No, I know, but what if it ripped when you were taking it off?
Yeah.
"Yeah" as in "That's what happened"?
I don't know.
Come here.
I hate my genes.
I was on the pill when I was 17, but I turned into my mother...
Anxious, depressed.
I'm fine.
I just had my period, so...
Yeah, I'm just being paranoid.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
It is.
No, it's the condom manufacturer's fault.
Yeah, but if I wasn't so big, it never would've broke.
Come on.

It wasn't.
- I thought it was.

Hey.
Those detectives are here.
Could these drugs hurt the baby?
No.
They have you on Dilaudid because it's safe for pregnancy.
Send them in.
I walked in, I didn't see anyone, so I looked in the kitchen.
That's when I saw that the basement door was open, so I went down there.
What did you see?
Um...
I just heard a... mm...
A noise coming from upstairs, and then I woke up here.
When Professor Keating called you, did she say why she wanted you at the house?
You're trying to charge her with my attempted murder, right?
Annalise didn't do this.
Because you know who did?
Well, that's your job to figure out.
It's got to be Frank's, right?
He's only been back a week.
Yeah, well, it only takes one orgasm to make a baby.
Can we please stop talking about this, especially in front of my mom?
Why?

Mom?
Mom?
Michaela.
What does it say?
I'm sorry.
I told her to go.
Yeah, but that was before she knew anyone was dead.
She knew.
She's probably at the airport.

I don't...
I don't care.
Look, anyone would be upset by this.
I'm upset because our friend is dead, not because of that terrible woman.
Did you really just call Waitlist your friend?
'Cause I kind of recall you hating him before he became barbecue.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Dibs on the second shower.
You not eating?
What, you trying to keep it tight for a conjugal, or you just afraid of needing to drop the kids off at the pool?
Look, you gonna pee, drop a deuce, get your period, have sex in front of us.
Sooner you get over it the better.
Mm!
Ahh.
See, it's easy.
It's no different than you alone in what I'm guessing is some big ol', fancy crib...
Bitch, will you just leave her be?
Or do I need to drown you in your own piss?
So, you admit going to talk to Ms. Keating in her holding cell, and this is just an hour after you talked to the Medical Examiner?
Due to our prior relationship,
I felt she might disclose key evidence for us.
To be clear, you did this on your own.
No one in this office cleared you to do that?
No.
Well, Nate, I'm sorry, but we're gonna need to reassess your position here.
You tell him about us?
- Nate.

We've been sleeping together.
I imagine any demotion might be construed as sexual harassment.
Grabbing a woman's ass is never okay.
I thought you were my girlfriend.
That's the best excuse you could come up with, Baby Trump?
Mm, it's not an excuse.
You look just like her.
You might know her...

I might know her 'cause she's black?
We all look alike?
No.

So you're a racist and a pervert.
H-How does that make me a racist?
I-I can understand a pervert, sure, but...
Wes.

He'll tell you.
Doesn't she look exactly like Michaela?
Oh, my God.

You kind of look like her.
See?

Come anywhere near me again, and I report you to the police.
You think that was racist, don't you?
I just think you're white.
Please don't tell Michaela.
Stop it.
Sorry.
How you doing?
I just need sleep.
I told you I want to be alone.
I know.
I just didn't know if you really meant that.
What's going on, Oli?
Annalise asked me to delete everything on her phone last night... before I knew Wes was dead.
- That means she did this, right?

You told Bonnie you thought she did it.
Yeah, I was wrong.

Or maybe you're lying to me the same way you lied about the night of the bonfire.
Sam Keating went missing that night.
His remains were found a few weeks later.
Did you all do that?
Do you really want to know?
No, because the minute you tell me...
I'm guilty, too, right?
Of conspiracy to commit murder, obstruction of justice?
You could go to the police right now.
Nobody would blame you.
- I just want to be by myself right now.

- We don't even need to talk.

Okay.

I'll be at Michaela's.
Thanks for seeing me.
The autopsy report's not out yet.
I know, but you must have heard something...
I haven't.
I can't be telling you when I do.
Why'd you go to her last night if you don't want to help?
So I could look her in the eye and see if she did this.
She didn't.
You know that for a fact?
This is your shot to get on the right side of this.
I can take you upstairs, give you immunity.
You should go.
Don't call me again.
- Visitor.

Her.

Oh, finally!
I won't look.
Hey, you gave in!
Now you got a visitor.
Don't forget to wipe.
I pushed the bail hearing a day.
Why?
They still haven't released the autopsy reports, which we need if we want to challenge a bail denial.
Did you go to Nate?
We don't need Nate.
The M.E. will release the cause of death soon, and we're still looking for who the source is.
"We"?
Frank.
I don't want him anywhere near this.
He's not.
I promise.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Tell me you found something.
Call log from the station last night...
Every call made or received.
Best I could do.
What's wrong?
She needs a real lawyer.
What would Sam say right now?
You're as good as Annalise.
Let's go.
Did you call your parents?
Do you want me to call them?
Mm, they'll just make it worse.
BonBon said the police will be stopping by.
Yeah, they were here.
They wanted me to tell them it was Annalise.
- Did you?

Why not?
Annalise wouldn't hurt Wes.
She would if he was gonna turn her in.
- She probably had Frank do it.

And you're just protecting Frank 'cause the baby's his, right?
Shut your mouth right now.
Annalise wouldn't do this.
Then why did she have Oliver delete everything from her phone?
What are you talking about?
She told him to clear her phone before he knew that Wes was dead.
And now he might go to the police.
You have to stop him.
No.
- Have you lost your mind?

How do you know that she didn't do this or that she's coming for one of us next?
It was the Mahoneys.

How do we know this wasn't you?
What?
Where were you last night?
I was with Thomas.

And he'll verify that?
Because you haven't seemed that upset by this.
Do you seriously think I did this?
Wes is dead, and you're not upset at all!
Who's the person who started all this?
It's always been him.
- Stop talking.

Maybe part of me is relieved that he's gone.
- Connor!

The baby is Wes'.
Well, you should just get an abortion now, 'cause Waitlist isn't the type of father you want for your child.
Asher!
- Hit me!

- Do it!

Get off!

Asher, what is wrong with you?

Waitlist!
Aww.
You look like a picture straight out of a Middleton brochure.
You know, if they allowed killers in there.
What do you want?
I just like looking at you.
I have to study, Connor.
I just got out of therapy.
It's the first time I've been back since I was 17 and needed to talk through all my gay stuff.
Now I just need to talk through all my murder stuff.
I'm kidding.
I talked about Oliver the whole time.
It's lame, I know.
He just needs space.
How do you know?
He got really drunk at my birthday party the other night and told Meggy.
We should let them go, right?
Like, if we were at all good people, we'd want them to be free of us.
Maybe.
What did you do to him?
I-I assume there's a reason that he went all frat boy on you.
I said something stupid.
Grief makes people do stupid things.
How are you?
I don't know.
I can't even look at you right now.
Is that what you were like when you ran over Sinclair?
You've got some crazy rage problems or something?
- I'm just upset.

You don't seem that sad.
I'm sad.
I'm just not crying about it every second like you.
Okay, but what about when your mom left?
That clearly hurt you...
We're dealing with your mess right now, not mine.
We're all a mess right now!
That's the point!
And maybe I'm supposed to hide that or pretend that I'm some unfeeling jerk,
but...

That doesn't mean you get to act like an animal.
Go home.
What?
I'm staying here with Laurel to make sure you didn't put her on suicide watch.
What?
Look at this number...

Brookline, Mass.
Hannah Keating called the police at 10:30 that night.
It was after the fire started.
I don't know how she could have found out about it so soon unless she knew it was going to happen.
Or she was working with the Mahoneys.
It seems insane, I know, but she's always wanted the house, and she'd know that hurting Wes would hurt you.
I called her.
Automated voice-mail box for...
Hannah Keating.
You always hated my black ass living in your mommy and daddy's house.
So take it, Hannah.
I'm done with it.
Not like anything good happened to me since the minute I moved in here.
That's not enough to incriminate you.
She thinks I killed Sam, so she'll say whatever it takes to ruin me.
She finally won.
It just took me helping her.
Shopping for Meggy?
You feel bad you dumped her and think tacky jewelry will win her back?
No.
Then who's it for?
Do not say Annalise.
No.

Laurel.
Don't tell anyone.
Why not?
The same reason you didn't want to tell us about Asher.
Because I was embarrassed of him.
Which makes sense if you're Laurel in this situation, but you...
Mm.
You're worried Frank's gonna find out.
He'll kill you.

We're happy.
I just... don't want to ruin that.
I won't tell anyone.
- Thanks.

You broke up with Meggy like five minutes ago, and now you're already buying jewelry for some other girl?
It's not just some other girl.
I'm just saying, maybe you need to be alone for a second.
How would you know what I need?
This is the most we've ever talked.
Well... it's not like you come talk to me, either.
How much can you spend?
'Cause our girl's rich, and she'll know if you cheap out.
Your nurses are no joke.
They won't give up the pain meds.
Should I get ice chips?
I could read you a ConLaw brief.
That should put you right to sleep.
How's your mom?
Uh, she left.
Why?
It doesn't matter.
Please.

Um...
I kicked her out.
It was before I knew what happened.
Or I'm just a horrible person.
You're not.
I am.
Whatever you need or decide,
I'm here for you, okay?
Oh, press it.
It's green.
Automated voice-mail box for...
Hannah Keating.
So, take it, Hannah.
I'm done with it.
No, no!
You burned a boy in your house.
Or that's... what I heard the guards say.
Good thing you a lawyer.
I knew I'd seen your face before...
In court once, waiting on one of my cases.
You was wearing this badass red-leather jacket...
Had them Malaysian tracks flowing, guns out, screaming at that old-white-man D.A.
And I'm thinking,
"Why can't this queen defend me?"
Jacked up, ain't it?
No matter how high or how far we climb, they gonna find a way to pull us back down.
I have a plan.
If I compel them to disclose Hannah as their source,
I can undermine her testimony completely.
She accused you of killing Sam.
It all speaks to her bias against you.
Tell me you think it's a good idea.
Whatever you think.
Due to the heinous nature of this crime, specifically the murder of Wesley Gibbins, we believe Ms. Keating's release would pose a threat to the citizens of Philadelphia.
And with her financial resources...
We see little impeding her flight.
Therefore, the State strongly recommends
Your Honor deny her bail.
Ms. Winterbottom?
Your Honor, the State's evidence to support their allegations against my client is lacking, if not non-existent.
We aren't arguing the facts of this case today, Your Honor.
Any effort to deny my client bail must be based on credible evidence...
But the State's case is based on an anonymous source.
Objection.

My client was arrested before an autopsy of the victim could be conducted.
There's an independent basis for probable cause.
It's our right to ask that the source be identified to know whether there's any warrant to this case.
Mr. Denver, may I ask why you don't want to reveal this source?
We are protecting their safety, Your Honor.
Well, certainly there's additional evidence you could offer the court to prove that the defendant should remain in custody until the trial, otherwise I'm inclined to set bail.
Your Honor, we would ask for a short recess so that we may discuss the matter internally?
15 minutes.
Oh, my God.

I said some stuff I shouldn't have.
Well, where is everyone?
Michaela's at the hospital.
Asher's at Annalise's bail hearing.
And you didn't want to go?
I don't know what I want to happen to Annalise right now.
Because you think she did it?
I don't know.
Oli, you got to go to the police.
- No.

- She didn't.

- And what about you?

- I-I'm not just gonna go turn you in.

You're my life, Connor.
- Well, you can find someone better!

I slept with Thomas.
That's what I was doing last night.
I was...

I...

You still want to protect me?
- Of course.

You just slept with him to hurt me.
Yeah, and I'm gonna continue to hurt you.
It's...

It's who...

It's who we all are.

No.

Look, I don't even care that Wes is dead.
I don't.

I feel nothing.
I'm just broken and sick, and I need all of this to stop.
So, please... please, just do what I never could.
You're bleeding.
I...
You can end all this.
Just be quiet.
This is a question of safety, Your Honor, which is why we cannot reveal the identity of our source.
However, we are prepared to disclose an additional piece of evidence at this time.
Ms. Atwood.
Your Honor, I've been running point on an investigation into Annalise Keating's potential involvement in a number of unsolved crimes.
We approached Wesley Gibbins with an immunity deal in exchange for his cooperation in building the case against her.
Mr. Gibbins did not sign the immunity deal, but you can see he made notations which prove he was about to accept the terms.
Unfortunately, he left the station and, in just a few hours, was killed in a fire.
We proffer that Mr. Gibbins went to Ms. Keating's, told her about the investigation, which is why she killed him.
Your Honor, there are other suspects the D.A.'s Office is refusing to look into.
Furthermore, our investigation...
The victim was an eyewitness in the Charles Mahoney murder trial.
All the evidence points to Ms. Keating.
Clearly, the Mahoney family had motive to kill Mr. Gibbins.
Ms. Winterbottom, you asked for more evidence.
- This is it.

I'm denying Ms. Keating's request for bail and ordering that she be remanded to Philadelphia County Prison to await trial.
Wes didn't sign the deal.

Bonnie.
If that's all they have, I'll get it thrown out.
Didn't you hear them?

You did your best.
Good afternoon.
On behalf of the District Attorney's Office, we're pleased with the judge's decision to keep Annalise Keating in state custody for the duration of her prosecution.
A young man has been murdered, and it is of the upmost importance to A.D.A. Atwood and myself that Ms. Keating be brought to justice for this heinous crime.
You're right.
I acted like a Neanderthal, and... clearly, that's something I have to work on, and I will, but... to have to spend another night in that dorm, alone...
Promise me I'll never see you act that way again.
- I promise.

That's not behavior I can handle.
- I know, and I...

I'm not the only one you need to apologize to.
We intend to hold Ms. Keating accountable for her violent, senseless actions.
Hey.
One of her own law students at Middleton University.
He was someone who trusted her, who worked for her, and, ultimately, was murdered by her.
Current charges against Ms. Keating are arson and first-degree murder.
But we have just scratched the surface of the evidence we plan to present.
In the past, Ms. Keating has been questioned for crimes close to her that have gone unsolved...
Most notably the murder of her husband, Sam Keating.
This trial will yield new information about that murder.
We're also here today to announce that we've received the official autopsy report for Mr. Gibbins.
Dr. Bradfield of the Philadelphia Medical Examiner's Office has confirmed our initial suspicions that Mr. Gibbins' cause of death is asphyxiation due to smoke inhalation.
This reaffirms our belief that Ms. Keating planned and executed the fire in order to kill Mr. Gibbins.
Mmm!

I saw someone there... in the basement.
They ran out of the storm door.
Was it you?
No.
It should have been you.
He'd still be alive if you would have just stayed away.
But he's dead.
I don't blame Annalise for that.
I blame you, 'cause it's always you.
I loved him so much more than I have ever loved you.
It should have been you.
Well, look who's back.
You're not permitted to be here.
You said he died before the fire.
Before I did the official autopsy.
Our initial theories change all the time.
Here.
I ain't trying to kill you.
What, y'all girlfriends now?
It's Frank.

They're saying Wes died in the fire, and it's not true, so...
Just...

We were told you wanted to make a statement?
About the murder of Wes Gibbins.
What about it?
I did it.
Hey.
Get in.
Come on.
