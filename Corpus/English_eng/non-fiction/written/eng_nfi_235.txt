- Sorry.

What?
Where are we?
Home.
Hmm...
It's not the dojo.
no.
But it's the safest place I know.
How do you feel?
uh...
I'm tired.
I was so worried about you.
You okay?
I feel great.
Hmm.
What happened?
Danny.
Saved my life.
It's a lot... having to keep a secret like this.
And I...

Joy.
Dad.
Lying to everyone. he could make it better.
he couldn't make it better.

Joy.
I understand your feelings are hurt.

I had no choice.
I was trapped.

You told Danny.
Danny found out.

we just do the best we can.
Do you remember those nights?
When I was sick?
And you and Ward were there every two hours.
Yeah.
we had to turn you in your bed.
Keep you from getting bedsores.
Mmm-hmm.

But you wouldn't let the hospice nurse do it.
You were so thin... and fragile.
You were like parchment.
I was afraid they might break you.
And sometimes... sometimes I'd wake up... asleep in the chair... and you'd be looking just like you were when you were kids.
So peaceful.
I'd pray.
I would plead to the universe that if I...
I'd do anything.
to keep you away.
Keep you away from that pain and that heartache. because you'd endured so much already.
Joy...
I...

I'm...


I'm just glad the universe listened.
Yeah.
What was it like?
What?

Hmm.

But this time... the door wouldn't open.
And I could hear you.
and...
I...

But the harder I tried... the further I'd just...
I'd drift away and... it would become colder... and colder.
and I was here.
Restored.
Joy... happy.
Happy and whole.
too.
Yeah.
But this is strange.

I know.

Where is he?
Joy.
don't you?
I know.

and it hasn't helped.
addicts can be...

But we've gotta do everything we can to help him.
Everything.
That shouldn't keep us from getting Rand back... and turning it into what I'd always hoped for.
Our family's legacy.
I know.
Ward told me about the... the blackmail.
- I...

that... that Hogarth and the courts to work out.
I don't want you risking anything.
Where's the risk? and you're... you're gonna wanna answer honestly and truthfully.
under oath.
Mmm-hmm.

it won't come to that.
- Yeah.

I know that secrets... secrets and lies have... they've taken a toll on our family.
but...
I want a future free from all of that.
for me... for all of us.
Hey.
Okay.
This is where I came when I first returned from my grandfather's in Japan.
What is this?

a bit of both.
A safe place for people who need a home.
helped me get settled.
Who's "they"?
Bakuto and his group.
Your sensei?
Our sensei.
Everyone here.
Danny.
Maybe the only one I've ever known.
I'm glad you're here.
Colleen.
Welcome.
How are you feeling?
uh...

Thanks for showing me how to heal her.
Of course.
though.
Yeah.
Are you ready to recharge?
What do you mean?
the Immortal Weapon.
Uh... not many people know what that is.
it's always been a special interest of mine.
But you weren't taught how to recharge your chi?
Let's just say my training went a little sideways.
Fair enough.
Then step this way.
Just follow my lead.
so you'll recognize most of the moves.
they're gonna take you somewhere else.
I call it harnessing the Five Elemental Energies.
Why are you frowning?
I'm not.
But you are.
Our bodies always give away our inner truth.
Release whatever's binding you.
fear... trust.
You are rooted... tied to the force that binds all life.
Let it course through you.
Let it replace everything that is broken.
Now... how do you feel?
Hungry.
too.
can you go ahead and let the kitchen know that we're on our way?
There's something I'd like to show Danny first.
Yeah.

She's very special.
Yeah.
Colleen has spoken to me about you quite a bit.
That's funny... she's never mentioned you.
Hmm.
She's just being protective.
Does that bother you?
No.
But why keep all of this a secret?
There's a difference between "secret" and "secure.
we take in people from all walks of life who need safety.
They need that because their lives were complicated... sometimes.
we try and keep a low profile.
We give them a safe haven...

What's that? a community that can help you become all that you can be.
So it's a cult?
just like the Girl Scouts.

And Gao?
What have you done with her?
She's been taken out of commission.

She murdered my parents... almost had us killed.
I need to know where she's gone.
I've placed her in confinement until we can be sure that turning her over to the police will get us the right results.
Her power is far-reaching.
We can't take any chances.
guys.
This place...

It should.
The same atmosphere that shaped you in the monastery is present here. educate young people in the same way.
Did Colleen tell you everything about me?
Not everything.
my office is this way.
Sensei.
I understand when you say you're training people.
Can I get you to sign this?
exactly?
You wanna know what's in it for me?
yeah. they... they want to use it for their own purposes.
Yeah.

They make their own choices.
Participate only in things they feel comfortable with.
come in.
Have a seat.
Danny.
Something significant.
And I wanna be ready.
I want my family and friends to be ready.

not governments.
Oligarchies of the rich and powerful.
But that's not gonna last much longer.
But Rand is a corporation.
Exactly my point.
what have you discovered? or... something else?
Rand isn't what you hoped it would be.
But you are just the person who can turn it around.
I'm sure of it.
What I'm about to show you is something that's been kept secret for decades.
Hidden by the Chinese government... because they didn't know how to explain it.
But I think you'll understand it immediately.
a group of Chinese soldiers got lost in the mountains during a mission being recorded for propaganda purposes.
but... someone was there... protecting this passage.
he had no interest in letting them pass.
Danny.
That's what you could be.
That's what an Iron Fist is.
Why are you so interested in the Iron Fist? training with masters of all kinds... listening to their stories and legends about Immortal Weapons.
I thought they were fairy tales for children... until I was gifted that film. learning all that I could about the Iron Fist.
What it was capable of.
What it could achieve.
That's how you know about the healing. because they haven't met you...

there's more where that came from. and I've just opened up a way for you to recharge your chi.
I can help you become what you were meant to be.
But that was the Iron Fist doing his duty.
Guarding an entry.
then... you got the wrong man.
Danny.
I need a partner.
no one would stand against us.
The Gaos of the world would be destroyed.
So what do you know about Gao?
I've been trying to stop her for a long time.
I have seven students here rehabbing from her drugs. that's what it is.
There are Gaos everywhere.
I need you to train and lead a group of people who will take care of those that our culture's left behind.
The marginalized and forgotten.
People like Colleen.
People like you.
Come on.
I'm a billionaire.
Is that how you feel?
Inside?
You know you don't fit in at Rand.

You can use help there as well.
I can provide that.
But your destiny... is here.
Doing something only you can do.
let it ring.
Joy.
Danny?
I've been meaning to call.

right.
I have someone here who wants to speak with you.
Danny.
Harold?
You're alive.
why wouldn't I be?
I came to the penthouse.

I thought Gao... listen...

She knows?
it's all right.

I'll get there as soon as I can.
Danny.
I know.
But you'll be glad to hear that Gao is finally out of the way.
- What?

I met this guy named Bakuto.

she's dead?
I can't confirm that.
I'm trying to find out if she's been sent to jail or something else.
But I've been assured by Bakuto that she's out of commission.
Bakuto?
He's a friend.
I think.
all right?
get here as soon as you can.
he did it.

he did it.
- He did what?

he has... he's eliminated Gao.
- He has eliminated...

we have to celebrate.

who... who's Gao?
40-year-old.
This is supposed to be the best... best single malt of all time.
it is too early to be drinking...

- And I'm...

stop!
- Yeah.

I didn't...

Joy.
Um...

Come in.
sir.
To whom?
Joy Meachum.
And she passed the phone off to a Harold.
Harold Meachum?
Are you sure about that name?
sir.

Send the entire transcript to my computer.
And see if you can trace back that call to its exact location.
sir.
How was he?
He seems ready.
Thank you for all you've done.
I didn't do anything.
I know this has been hard on you.
right?
Soon.

But we need to be honest.
I need to be.
I don't like keeping things from him.
He'll understand.
What if he doesn't?
Then... he's not right for you.
It's complicated...

But it's for the best. but if he feels about you the way you feel about him... he'll make the right choice.
Danny!
Danny!
Darryl.

Colleen brought me.
thinking about it.
That would be so kick-ass.
I...

This is the guy that whacked that kid with a pole.
uh...

I thought it was awesome.
So... you like it here?
It's what you wanted?
- Yeah.

People care about me here.
fit in wherever.
too.
and I've been learning a ton.
- I bet I could take you now.

You think?
See?

what's your day like?
Can you come and go as you please?
Kind of.

We all live in the dorms here.
But there's a curfew.
You ever try and sneak out?
- Security's too tight.

Are there any areas off-limits?
a few.

I talked to all of 'em already.
Clear the east perimeter.
You know the deal.

Of course.
I'm guessing you can see me.
I'm glad you're finally getting what you deserve.
Punishment is so juvenile.
I might add.
Not for me.
I'm not surprised.
You're still a child.
at least I'm not in prison.
Is that what this is?
was willing to let you live whatever life you wanted.
pursued and kidnapped me.
Then you ran towards slavery as fast as you could.
You're an idiot.
Really?
Now you're baiting me with insults?
I am treating you with respect by being who I truly am.
Not everyone around you does the same.
That's not true!
They are stealing your ability to trust.
That is how they crush you.
Who?
The Hand.
What are you talking about?
young man.
Where do you think you are?
I see you found what you were looking for.
isn't she?

I was just looking for some answers.
You won't find them here.
I've tried.
But I'm glad you came... because now you know she won't work with us... either.
I deliver him back into your capable hands.
Enjoy your evening.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Gao's here.
Oh.
Did you talk to her?
Manipulating as always.
Working an angle.
Trying to get me to question everything.
Even you.
In what way?
She implied that this was the Hand.
Bakuto.
There was a ceremonial knife in his office.
I recognized it because men from the Hand used one like it.
Colleen?
I wanted to tell you from the beginning.
No.
just listen.

Listen to me.

Explain what?
The Hand are murderers and killers!
Gao!

She doesn't represent us.

That she's the bad Hand and you're the good Hand?
Come on!
You've been lying to me this whole time!
That's not true.

Did Bakuto give you that money the first time we met in the park?
Don't be ridiculous.
Was it okay with him when I stayed around at the dojo?
Danny.

Make it make sense.
all I'm hearing are lies
- and evasion...

I already felt the way I feel.
And was that before or after you knew about the Fist?
Before.
And was it his idea that you sleep with me?
Danny...
So when did Bakuto approach you with this... this idea of recruiting me?
isn't it?
- Recruiting isn't what we do.

The only reason anybody is interested in me is because of the Fist.
not the Iron Fist.
Then why lie?

Because you've been brainwashed!
that's hilarious coming from someone who grew up inside of a cult!
Just... think about it.
you freak out.
You run off to the docks or...

Because you grew up in a place hearing one story about us and nobody ever questioned that view.
I understand.
But those were lies shoved down your throat
- when you were a kid...

By people who live in the past.
Just consider for a moment that maybe... just maybe... they got it wrong.
No.
this is my family.
And my family are dead because of your family.
You're not listening.
- That was Gao.

Everything you're saying is bullshit.
And coming from someone that I thought I could trust.
Hello.
be seated.
What the hell is this? please eat.

My name is Bakuto.
I'll be taking over from Madame Gao.
Ah.

Not directly.
But... you should know by now that our reach is extensive.
I guess I was too optimistic to imagine the Hand would let me go.
I think you'll find I'm much more easygoing than Gao.
she leads through fear.
I find partnership to be a much more effective method.
Oh... what are you proposing?
Everything that is Gao's is now mine.
You proceed as you have but with a different goal.
And what would that be?
A way out.
A return to public life for you.
Go on.
I'm listening.
we have to be extra cautious at this time.
This is disappointing.
I was hoping you wouldn't take the bait and dig further.
Even sneaking down to kill Gao would have been better than this.
More lies.
Simply a test.
And you failed.
No.
Wow.
You are the worst Iron Fist ever.
Davos?
were you?
What?
I know.
What are you...

it's really too much to go into.
it hardly matters.
we need a moment.

You might wanna check the file I left on your desk.
yes you do. embezzling money from the Rand pension fund into your Cayman accounts...
I don't know what this is all about but...

Mine... and yours.
What?
If you thought it was possible to kick my children out the door then you're sadly mistaken.
This is a blackmail scheme.
it won't work.
it won't.
Blackmail's about the last thing on my mind.
I'm here to talk about... our children... and... what we owe them as fathers.
this is exhausting.
you don't think I had them turned off for routine maintenance?
Lawrence.
Now... uh... we can both agree that our children and their lives right?
- I guess.

fall from grace might do to them? shamed on all fronts?
yeah.
And Michael.
Uh-oh.
Don't bring him into this.
he's so fragile already.
barely treated.
I know.

I know what it's like to have a troubled son.
- Stop.

you and I. important to come and offer you an easy solution.
Which is?
You're gonna kill yourself.
Right.
you know. stressed by a life and a job that simply overwhelmed him.
You go out a tortured hero.

You better get the hell out of here. but I can tell you right now that I will never...
Honestly?

I don't care.
that's just sad.
Because a father's first responsibility to their kids is to provide a beautiful lie for them to live in.
system reboots?
thirty.
make sure you get the fingerprints and the gunpowder residue right.
I guess you better hurry.
Lei Kung sent me to bring you home.
Who the hell are these people?
It's the Hand.
What?
Then we'll kill as many as we can on our way out.
two-man teams!
Move it!
- Over here!

what's going on?
- It's Danny.

Find him!
Come on!

though.
but we have to go quickly.
Stealing apples from Master Q'uon was harder.
Ready?
- Yeah.

- Darryl.

- Get outta the way.

- The gate!

forget him!

- To the gate.

The Fist!

now!
We're out of time.
Block that area. your confusion... it's destroyed your chi.
The Fist won't work.
You cannot access it.
This wasn't the plan.
- Eric.

Please forgive me.
Shit!
go!
Close the gate!
Come on!
Come on.

What?
Keep moving!

Did he get away?
You did your best to stop him.

did you?
No.

Killing Danny is the last thing we want.
- Let's get him patched up.

This young man is our future.
Come on.
It's my sad duty to inform you all that...
Lawrence Wilkins committed suicide last night.
and Rand needs to respond accordingly.
we have been riddled with controversy over the past few weeks.
the firing of me and my brother... and now we have this. will plummet even further.
Unless... you see fit to reinstate the visionaries that led Rand to historic profits.
Right the ship.
Show Wall Street and the world that stability is being restored. but Rand should quiet those fears with a show of strength.
The Meachums will set things right.
Now the truth is... you need us.
I move that we... reinstate the Meachums... and Mr. Rand.
I second the motion.
All those in favor...
Aye.
To family.
Joy.

I'm not sure I did anything.
come on.

You know...

I felt your presence.
It gave me this sense of comfort.
the wishful thinking of... of a daughter who missed her dad.
Now I know it was something else.
You were there... watching... conspiring.
it's not like that.
But it is.
And you know it.
You remember the promise you made?
No more lies.

I need to know... did you have Wilkins killed?
I know the promise I made.
And I'm a man of my word.
No.
I did not have Lawrence killed.
Good.
I'm glad to hear it.
But I'm afraid to say there is someone we are gonna have to destroy.
His name is Bakuto.
We have to stop.

We won't be able to get you through the airport like this.
- We need to get you stitched up.

Danny.
No.
and you are not there to protect it.
We're going back.
but I can't just leave.
You had no trouble leaving us.
you were just gone.
Without a word.
thinking you'd be back.
What happened?
I'm not sure I can explain.
You owe me an answer.
The people of K'un-Lun need to know why they were abandoned.
And what about the people here?
The ones who were just trying to kill you?
Danny.
Failed in every way.
The Fist won't even ignite now.
Our only chance may be to return and submit to Lei Kung.
because if not...
I don't know what happens.
