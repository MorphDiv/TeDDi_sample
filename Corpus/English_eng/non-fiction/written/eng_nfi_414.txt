Previously on Outsiders...
Was a white boy in here with you?
I have cancer.
There just hasn't been a good time to tell you.
You know...
I am Morgan, and we are the Kenna.
We were told that your man had passed.
You have no right to ransack it.
We will find somewhere else.
Better make it a home than let it fall to ruin.
We blocked access to the town.
Each man is going to survey a stretch of woods.
The roads we can't close, we post guards.
So no more Farrells coming down here disturbing the peace...
Shit!
I'm just lookin' for somebody.

Well, if he was dead, the coroner would've taken his body to the morgue.
I'm headed that way if you want a ride.
Give me two minutes.
You know you got a wild animal in your truck?
Drop that!

Put your hands behind your head.
Tell us what you did with the gun.
What gun?
The one you used to kill Breece Dobbs.
I didn't kill nobody.
Bail is denied.
Found you in the middle of the road.
I've got big plans for you.
Stitch him up.
He asked for a circle.
Yeah, and he don't deserve one.
Not for you to say!
No, it's for me.
Get him up.
Get him cleaned up and get him to a bed.
He'll get his circle first light.
Take him to Li'l Foster's.
He's not to leave the house and be eyes on it.
Okay.
Take me to my own bed.
We are.
What's he want a circle for?
I reckon to stake his claim to bein' Bren'in.
She ain't gonna let that happen, not after everything he's done.
Look, we may be bound by law.
She only took the oath on account of he was dead.
G'Winn is my Bren'in.
If he tries to harm one hair on her head,
I'm gonna cut him down myself.
You sure this is a good idea?
He has the right to a circle.
What come out, come out.
What the hell?
They call themselves the Kenna.
Said they came up from shadowside a day ago.
Why'd they burn my things?
Here.
Hey, you do this?
Huh?
Answer me.

Hey, hey.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Foster Farrell.
All apologies, sir.
We were told thou had perished.
Oh, so you take my house?
And you torch my belongings.
The burning' was meant as a purification, a blessing in your memory, sir.
Well, get outta here, and I don't care who you are.
I am Morgan.
And hear me say I am happy to see you alive.
Get yourself gone.
As you wish.
Okay.

Upstairs now.
Wash up and homework, then bed.
You heard your dad.

I don't have any homework.
Hey, and, Hilda, I saw you kissin' that cat before.
I don't want you doin' that, okay?
He hasn't had his shots.
That cat pisses me off.
I think it's doin' the girls some good.
Gettin' their mind a little bit off... everything that's happened.
When you gonna tell them?
When the time is right.
Yeah?

- I don't know.

You have to face it.
I know what's happening.
Yeah?

This cancer, it's a message... from God, and he's showin' me the path that I have to travel.
Well, what-what path is that?
That I have to be of use with what precious time that I've got left.
Well, I mean... regardless of whatever, you know, celestial message you're receiving', there's still practicalities to take care of.
There's treatment.
There's gonna be the childcare while you're...
And that's gonna be expensive.
Yeah, I know it is.
I'll take care of it.
Hmmpf.
I will take care of it.
They ain't gonna move.
Stubborn one, eh?
Well, boy, you'll learn.
Hey, you're gonna hurt yourself.
Medical ain't no better.
What's wrong with you?
I killed my mother.
I killed Lady Ray.
I took the oak in a manner impure.
And the punishment for this, for all that I've done, be banishment.
You are the rightful Bren'in.
My fate is in your hands and the elders.
So whatever comes... give mercy or no...
I will accept.
The proper punishment is accepted.
If the Bren'in agrees, you, Foster Farrell VI, are banished.
Yeah!
Bren'in, what say you?
The Bren'in will think on it and render a decision at a later time.
Well, wait a minute.

After all he's done...

That is my word!
The circle is complete.
Thank you all.
All right, take your time, take your time.
There you go.
Hey!
- Hasil.

You know, one of the happiest days of my life was the day that I heard you were shot dead.
The only thing that made me sad was that I didn't get to bury you.
Well, maybe you'll get your wish... soon enough.
No, you see, that's not our way.
Oh, it's what I deserve.
Maybe Asa'll come around and finish the job.
Asa?
Asa's dead, Foster.
And yet, here you stand.
Funny how things turned out.
You know, the only thing that gives me hope in this life is that I'm never gonna have to see you again.
He's right.
Asa's gone.
That boy got himself mauled up bad by somethin'.
Hasil, Barnabas, they found him in pieces.
Where?
I truly... truly wanted to say my sorries for what I done to you.
He tried to kill you, Foster.
Let that lossie rot.
You be careful what you say about my boy.
Bren'in.
- Kenna.

For what?
For any trouble I might have caused by taking that house.
I told you to take it.
Speak your mind.
It's not another mouth you need, I reckon, but an ear.
He surprised me.
I mean, bein' alive, and also admitting to what he'd done.
I wasn't prepared for that.
- So, it's true?

He killed his mother.
Did other things besides.
He's the one that hurt you.
He hurt us all.
And by his confession,
- you think he's changed.

The trouble is, there are some who are sympathetic to him.
And by confessing', he makes me look like the monster if I punish him.
There are also those sympathetic to you, stinging still from the damage he done, I imagine.
They won't want you to go softer, I'm certain.
And bein' a woman leading' men, I'm afraid that you will.
Well, you never saw our Lady Ray.
So, you say banishment?
Banishment, man can come back from.
There's only thing sure as sure can be...
Farrells don't kill Farrells.
Then I don't envy ye, Bren'in.
The needle, you have to thread it.
Still can't believe you crashed it.
Big metal doohies came up out of nowheres.
Anyways, we got bigger problems now.
Yeah?

Big Foster.
Think G'Winn's gonna let him stay?
Don't know.
Well, we can do your intake today if you'd like.
- Today?

We're a few hours from Blackburg.
Yeah.

Um, just put me down.

Okay.

Thank you.
Bye.
Hey, um, Yolanda's mother's car is in the shop, and, uh, she's been takin' the bus.
So can I use yours?
Just to get to work?
Yeah.
It ain't but 15 minutes from the Mini Mart.
I expect you walkin' back through that door at 5:15.
Yeah, okay.
Hey...
I just worry about you, that's all.
You earn trust and you get trust.
I know I'm required to.
It's on its way.
What else do you want me to...
Of course, I want to.

I get there as often as I can, Stewart.
I'm here doing a job.
It's a good thing one of us has one.
Otherwise there'd be nothing for him at all!
Good-bye.
Wade, come on in.
What can I do for you?
Well, I have a... a problem.
I was just hopin' to clarify something' with you.
Okay.

No.

I was lookin' at how you provide healthcare for employees and spouses.
It seems that generally that's the case, but, uh, Breece Dobbs, seems he wasn't covered.
I don't understand.
Oh.

It's my sister, and she was Breece's wife.
Oh, God!

Here, come sit down.
Is it serious?
Um, uh, yeah, it's pancreatic cancer.
Wade, I'm so sorry.
How sorry?
I don't control who gets healthcare.
That kicks in after a certain number of months, and Breece wasn't here long enough.
They got two kids.
Really?
Are-are you serious?
Are you just goin' back to work?
Hello?

You just gonna ignore me?
Well, would you look at that.
Looks like I was wrong about when Breece started here.
Looks like he is eligible for insurance after all.
What are you talkin' about?
I have to point out this little clerical error to the benefits department back in Roanoke, but then your sister should be covered in a couple of days.
I think the phrase you're searching for is "thank you."
Uh, yeah.

Don't mention it.
Earl!
Earl!
Don't act like you can't hear me, Earl.
I see ya there.
What is it, Virgil?
I told him he was gonna give before the bars did.
Oh, shit!
Hey, Ron, got one for the infirmary here.
Take him to the infirmary.
I don't think I can handle this one on my own.
He's a little big.
Rule 12.
He's not even supposed to be in the prison.
Ain't convicted yet.

Overcrowdin'.
Hey!

If you're headed where I think you're headed, we're goin' in there with you.
No offense, you're both strong of heart.
But I'm gonna need strong in other ways.
What?
She doin' with her medicine?
Where's Li'l Foster?
He ain't come to see me yet.
I sent him to find your body.
We didn't know it was somehow still up walkin' around.
Well, lostie took his best shot.
My boys, they say that he run off and then got hisself dead.
That true?
- It's true.

'Cause he was dead the first time when he shot me.
- I'm sure.

Show me.
Stitches worse than the wound.
You do that yourself?
No.

In a house of horrors, the likes of which I hope you never see.
You come to heal me?
I don't want it on my head you dyin' alone in the woods.
Hey, leave us.
Go.
I forgive you for what you done.
You forgive me?
Did what you had to.
What you thought was right for the clan.
And that's how I know that you are the rightful Bren'in.
One way, leastways, 'cause my boys also told me how you faced them lawmen down, your way.
Better than my way woulda been.
See, bein' Bren'in, the power of it, and the-the desire for it, changes ya.
Changed me.
Changed me for the worse.
Seems like it's changed you for the better.
Well, somethin's changed in me for the better, too.
Oh, that funny?
You weren't gone but a week.
That's not even enough time for a caterpillar to make a cocoon, let alone come back out a butterfly.
This change was growin' in me.
Long before I went away.
Can we talk?

Stay just outside.
I love you, G'Winveer.
I long have.
And I know that I ain't worthy of you yet, I know that.
But I hope that by admitting' what I done and takin' what comes, I can begin to be.
You'd say anythin' to get what you want.
That's what I know.
Then I won't show you by what I say.
I will show you by what I do.
Get it on tight.
Gather every gun we got.
Bring 'em all to me.
How far does it go?
Well, that way, it goes clear to Crow Rock.
That way, don't know.
Came to find you.
It could be a problem next time we need to go on a run.
Won't be doin' no more runs.
We're relying' too much on down there.
We need to get back to the old ways.
You know, it could cut us off from our own lands, too.
Good fishin' down at the falls, deer in the old woods.
Okay.

But, Hasil, don't be startin' any trouble.
Stay on our side for now.
The law of the mountain says all this is ours.
We're straying' from that completely.
You got somethin' to say, cousin, say it plain.
That man, he almost killed us all, and now you think about lettin' him back in.
If you think I'm the only one that's got a problem with that, Bren'in, then you foolin' yourself.
I hear you.
I'm just threading' the needle is all.
I need you to trust me.
Find out all you can about this here fence.
What happens if it goes all the way around?
We ain't trapped up here.

Like I said, without an oncologist exam, all I can give you is the ballpark figure.
Yeah, that's fine.
And she does have insurance.
Yeah.

That's good of you, to take some of the pressure off her.
Yeah, well, family.
You'd be surprised.
Okay.
So it looks like, with everything, she'd be looking at about $135,000 all in.
Okay.

I mean, uh, minus the insurance.
No, no, no.

Just $135,000 is the co-pay.
What the... how's anybody supposed to pay that?
- I mean, that's a death sentence.

How's it feel to work for a system like that?
Work for a system that kills people?
Might not be pullin' the trigger yourself, you might as well be.
Sorry.
You're just doin' your job.
Emelye, I come to you...
You said you're sorry in the circle, Foster.
Bren'in is strong.
She will make her decision on her own.
Oh, she's gonna banish me.

What is it you want then?
My mother.
She used to tell me stories, dark tales to scare me.
And?
Stories about this... this mountain... and that the-the natives here, the Cherokee, they called it Blood.
The ga-ha-gedane.
Blood Mountain, they named it, yes.
Well, these scary tales she told, they were of a clan, a cult of thieves, evildoers, of witches.
She said they were called the Kenna.
Yes, I heard those stories as a girl myself.
Fairy tales, I believe they are called, Foster.
And so, these Kenna, you don't fear them?
Would you if they were men?
You fear all women, don't you?
No, I fear... for our clan, is all.
Now I felt that I should speak my mind to you.
'Cause in the past, I disrespected you and the elders, and if I am allowed to stay, that will change.
So, Sally-Ann, you are here because you're thinking about terminating your pregnancy?
I-I don't know.

I mean, I just...

All right.

Less than two months.
Okay.

- and that's a pill.

Now state law requires that I give you some information, and it's about alternatives like adoption.
No, no, no.

You know what, I get it.

- I can't come back tomorrow.

Just come back when you can, and in the meanwhile, let's go do a physical and take another pregnancy test, just to be sure.
How much is the pill?
It's $800.
Is there another way?
There is, Sally-Ann, but that's $2,000 or $3,000 and we wouldn't be able to get you in for another couple months.
We're the only clinic for 200 miles.
Everyone else has been shut down.
Is there another place that I can go?
Can you get yourself to St. Louis or Ohio?
You might be able to find more affordable options.
I can't!
I-I ain't been too good with the upkeep of the place, but, uh, it's a good house and, um, it gets, um, pretty good light, uh, some mornings.
I can, uh, throw the furniture in if you think that'll help.
No, I think unfurnished is the way to go here.
I mean, if you're looking to drive up the price, you could repaint or re-do the kitchen, the bathroom, the other rooms.
Really?

Auntie Ray picked out a lot of this stuff.
I mean, uh, uh, the cabinets and the tile.
I mean, she had a pretty good eye.
But, you know, you're the expert.
Whatever you think will help.
You know what, it's probably fine.
That would just be puttin' money out in the hopes of gettin' more back, and, well...
What do you think I'm gonna get for it?
$15,000, maybe $18,000.
Ordinarily I wouldn't even do this.
No commission.
I'm here as a personal favor to you, Sheriff.
Well, thank you.

All right.
All right.

We got one more load.
- All right.

Uh-oh, sorry.
Still alive.
The house is yours, once and future.
I come on other matters.
Speak.
Me and mine got here not days ago.
We're new to your clan.
Sometimes it's the freshest eye that can see the most clear.
Hmmpf.

That G'Winn.

In years, maybe.

I've seen the looks on some faces when she speaks, and on those same faces when you come back.
There are some don't think she's up to leading'.
Think you are.
Well, G'Winn is stronger than she looks.
You can take my word on that.
Strong as you?
Who are you?
Just one who's joined my people to yours and worries for the fate of both in the tryin' times to come.
So, you're plannin' on bein' here a while then.
We have no other place to go.
Well, you are meddling' awfully high, awfully soon, for someone with no place else to go.
You're right.
You and yours, you got here not days ago.
You're new to our clan, but sometimes the freshest eyes, they don't see shit.
You love her, and that love is at war with another feelin'.
Which is the stronger?
I wonder.
That's good right there.
- Millie.

Same shit, different day.
Hmm.
Just, um... just these.
What do I owe you for that?
Uh, $32.65.
$32... $32.65?
It's just a little bottle, not even the real one.
No, that's your total, for the ibuprofen and your prescription.
What's the prescription?
Your OxyContin.

Oh.

I've been waitin' for you to come in.
Assume that's what you're after.
No.
- Oh.

Yeah.

- You sure?

Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Sit tight, Farrell.
We're gonna have plenty of time to break you.
Come on guys, let's get them Farrells.
Stay back.

Get on!
Are you sure you wanna do this?
It's the only way.
Let's go.
He said all the right things.
Aloud.
What insight?
Darkness...

Could be he's tryin' to change for true.
Or it could be he's waitin' 'til he's not so frail to show his colors.
- Bren'in.

Leave me.
It's gonna be steep even with the insurance.
I'm gonna sell the house.
If I do a bit of work on it, it'll drive up the value, and, uh, you know, we can pay the whole thing off in installments, cut a few expenses, and, uh, I'm more than willin' to take on a night job.
- Maybe I can do somethin' in security.

- I'm not gettin' treatment.

I appreciate all that you are tryin' to do.
I don't care if you appreciate it or not.
You're gettin' treatment.
No.

Or my kids.
It's months of pain and humiliation just so I can die anyway and leave you all in the poorhouse.
Do you have any idea what the alternative is?
Do you even know what you're sayin'?
Sh-h-h-h!
- Do you realize?

God has a plan for me.
I've seen it, and he's already showing' me that I'm doin' the right thing.
What about your kids?
He's got a plan for them, too.
And for you.
Whew.
What's goin' on?

This one took a tumble during patrol the other day.
Just went to get it back.
That's all.
And they won't come?
Look like they put up a fight.
It was in the wrong hands.
Hasil, I asked you not to start any more trouble.
I told you you needed to stay on this side of the fence.
What, more than we need these wheels?
Fightin' is what's gonna bring them back up here.
Yeah, and I didn't know
I was gonna have to fight when I went for it.
The fight came to me.
All right.

I'm just tryin' to help.
Now you asked me to trust you, and I do.
So, trust me.
Dad?
- Yeah, I'm in here.

Yeah, Caleb, I'm in here.
Are you okay?
Yeah.

Nothin'.
I was just worried you were sick.
No, I'm not sick.
I'll be out in a minute.
Okay.
Hey, I'm sorry.

What's this?
Goddamn pregnancy test.
Get out of the car.
I was tryin' to deal with it, okay?
I thought I told you to stop seeing' him.
I didn't go see him.

Stop lyin' to me!

- Would you just listen to me.

Come on!

Hey, don't you drive this car!
Don't drive my car!

Hey, don't you...

You don't come back then!
You leave like this, and you don't come back!
Li'l Foster back yet?
Not yet.
It's not like him to lose a trail.
If he's not back soonest, we'll look.
But I'm here about you.

Banishment's the proper sentence for what you've done, only the mountain already banished you, put you through some kind of hell down there from what you said, and then brought you back.
You know, Lady Ray used to say when you're most sure what the mountain wants, it makes you fools.
Where'd you get that?
It come to me.
When they came up here, we scared 'em off, but that won't be the last of it.
Now they're buildin' a fence, and I don't know for why.
Somethin's comin', Foster, and I don't trust you.
I don't, but a Bren'in needs certain tools, and I may need you for what's comin'.
It would be my honor to serve.
Heal up.
