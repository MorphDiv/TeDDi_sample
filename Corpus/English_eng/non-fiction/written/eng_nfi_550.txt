Hey, Jack, those racks don't go up there.
The ones with blue plastic go up there.
Okay, hey, sorry, I didn't realize.
Don't worry, you're fired.
By the way, we're gonna miss you tonight.
Don't get sentimental on me now.
But it won't be the same.
Shut up.
We did it.
Roman, have they finished the frame on the 6th floor yet?
Yes, and the framing on the 7th floor should be done within the next three hours.
The problem with the spokes in the basement?
Well, we solved that problem, too.
And if you start the enclosures tomorrow morning we should be one day ahead of schedule.
So go home.
Why?
Well, your family's arriving today, right?
Yeah, but they're not flying in until later in the night.
Well, you're better off leaving early in case there's traffic.
Now go on, get out of here and take tomorrow off.
Go on.
Do not come tomorrow, I know you.
This is WSNY and WSNY HD Columbus.
Merry Christmas from 795!

Passenger Jones, please see the ticketing agents at the gate.
Passenger Jones, please see the ticketing agents at the gate.
Please do not leave your luggage unattended luggage left unattended may be removed...
Thank you very much.
You're a good dancer.
Yeah, I'm waiting for a flight and it says it's delayed, but there's no ETA.
Yeah, taking off from Kiev, with a lay over in Frankfurt and New York.
That's right, yeah, I'm sure I didn't write it down wrong.
Please come with me.
My wife and daughter are arriving.
Around here.
Could you just have a seat in here, please?
Okay, thanks.
Can I get you any water, anything to drink?
Okay.
Roman Melnyk.
Where's my family?
My name is Eve Sanders and I'm one of the contact people assigned by the Airport Management Office.
I need you to listen very carefully to what I have to say.
The airplane that your wife and daughter were traveling in has had a very unfortunate accident.
There's still no official confirmation, but we need to keep in mind that with this type of accident it's unlikely that we'll find any survivors.
It is the worst news that anyone will ever receive.
She was pregnant.
Olena went to pick her up to bring her back.
Are this address and contact number correct?
And are there any other family members we should inform?
Not here or in your country of origin?
The Family Support Center has been set up at a hotel nearby.
You'll have access to medical and psychological treatments and social services.
That's also where you'll be updated on any news that comes in.
If you'd rather be alone, you can do that there, too.
No.
Please don't hesitate to call me.
Wait, wait, wait...
You didn't?
There's a toilet in the basement still jammed.
We're gonna wake up Samuel.
And when we took trips I always had to take him with me or I wouldn't be able to sleep.
This went on 'til much, much later.
How much later?
I don't know.
You always say that you can't sleep without me.
Some lousy substitute for Ishmael?
Hey, being Ishmael's substitute is a big honor.
I'd do anything for Ishmael.
Did you have sex with Ishmael?
I'm late for work.
L-R, 5-7-4, turn right on Bravo 2-6.
Two sips of that and you'll be running for the bathroom.
Yeah?
I'll remember you while I'm in the bathroom, if that's what you want.
No, no, thanks, I'm not gonna get that out of my head.
No, just remember who warned you.
What do we got?
I landed the last one and there's nothing on deck.
Canada 8-2-6, climb and maintain level 3-3-0.
Thank you, Columbus, and good night.
Evening.
Evening.
NA 1-9-7-9 descend to flight level 3-0.
Doing some maintenance on the telephone lines.
Gonna put it on security mode so it should work fine.
Roger AX 1-1-2, wait for confirmation on that descend.
What's up?
We got an unexpected flight, EF 1-3-5.
Connect me with Pittsburgh Airport, please.
Hello?
CMH, this is DH 6-1-6, do you copy?
Airbus EF 1-3-5, this is Tower C.
EF 1-3-5, good evening.
I'm having a problem with the phone lines and I can't get in touch with Pittsburgh.
CMH, this is DH 6-1-6.
We're getting a warning from our TCAS telling us to descend.
I repeat, the TCAS is telling us to descend, do you copy?
Tower, this is DH 6-1-6, do you copy?
Airbus EF 1-3-5, contact airport directly.
I repeat, contact Pittsburgh Airport directly.
Not a problem CMH, we'll contact Pittsburgh directly, over.
Tower, this is DH 6-1-6, do you copy?
AX 1-1-2, descend and maintain flight level 6-0.
Descend to 6,000 feet, do you copy?
AX 1-12, descending to 6,000 feet.
Tower, we've not heard confirmation from you but we're gonna go ahead and descend to 6,000 feet.
This goddamned phone!
EF 1-3-5, this is tower C, copy that.
AX 1-1-2, AX 1-1-2!
AX 1-1-2, do you copy?
AX 1-1-2!
Hey, Jake, have a seat.
Two planes collided in the air at high altitude.
Apparently, there's wreckage from both planes in a valley several miles, west of the 18.
It's unlikely anybody survived.
How many dead?
We don't know.
How many people were on those planes?
We don't know, Jake.
Oh, my God, how many people are dead?
Jake, listen to me.
It's very important you keep it together, alright?
Thank you.
At approximately 22:20 you stepped out for a cup of coffee.
You came back five minutes later.
At 22:25 Thomas told you he was gonna take a break and he left his station.
At 22:30 flight AX-112 requested permission to descend to 10,000 feet.
At 22:33, two technicians entered the control room to do some maintenance work on the phone lines.
You went to Thomas' station to process the other planes.
You called Pittsburgh, but the phone line wasn't working.
Meanwhile, flight AX-112 confirms its new altitude.
My sister just called and she heard something on the radio.
At 22:45 you contact the Airbus and tell it to communicate directly with the airport.
Without your headphones you never heard flight DH-616 alerting you it was about to descend.
Jake.
Jake.
Don't speak to anyone, okay?
Don't answer your phone, don't leave the house, don't go anywhere.
We'll speak again tomorrow.
Is that clear?
Jake.
Be strong, buddy.
The two planes collided in the air at more than 8,000 feet for reasons that have not yet been determined.
Family members are coming to the scene, trying to get any information that they can.
...passengers were on board, including the crew.
175 American citizens, 38 German, 37 Russian 18 French, two Ukrainian and one Spanish.
The two airlines involved have released a joint statement regretting the accident and assuring that they are already fully cooperating with investigators in order to clarify what happened.
We're live on the scene of the tragic accident.
Yeah?
How are you feeling today?
Fine.
Yes.
Good.
Like I said, I think it might help if you come to the Family Support Center.
Trying to find any evidence area hazmat crews, fire and police are on the scene.
Alright, Mr. Fox, have you ever been in a similar situation?
Ever helped out with other accidents or worked with victims before?
Go over by the truck, I'll bring over your equipment in a minute.
Nadiya!
Nadiya.
Nadiya.
Nadiya!
Olena.
Nadiya.
I don't know, I haven't seen him since this morning.
Come on, is he inside?
Hey, man, get up!
Come on, man, don't make me call the cops again, let's go.
I'm sorry, man, but every time you spend the night out here, I get in trouble.
So let's go, let's go.
It will probably be frustrating to look for one person to blame because what happened was much more complicated than that.
Daddy?
Samuel.
What are you doing there?
Just watching TV I can't sleep.
Can you not sleep either?
Let's make breakfast.
You know I'm hungry, too.
Come on.
Who were the people directly involved in the events we have just described?
After analyzing all the information from the black boxes testimonies from the people involved evidence found on the sites and all the other data made available to the press we can arrive at some conclusions...
Smell.
Green chilies, vinegar, garlic, thyme.
I love thyme.
First, there was only one air traffic controller in the control room ...managing the airspace.
Okay.
Alright, dig in.
It's okay we just spilled it, it's okay.
This stops now.
You can do this however you have to, but you don't get to do it to him, okay?
Stop...
I don't like you recording me!
What is this?
Mama, I love it.
Thank you, I love you.
Mr. Melnyk?
Mr. Melnyk?
My name is Tessa Corbett, I'm a journalist.
I know you're in there.
I don't want to bother you, I just came 'cause I wanted to share some of my articles with you.
I'm writing a book about the accident and I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You'll see from my articles that I'm trying to be faithful and respectful to the facts.
I'm sorry, but my house isn't presentable right now.
You haven't seen mine.
Hey, my wife made meatballs and she insisted that I bring you some.
She makes them with mushrooms, they're awesome.
Everything goes a little more slowly without you there.
So how are you?
Are you feeling any better?
No.
Yes, better.
Better it's just...
Sure.
And I need to get back to work.
I just need a little time to settle back in.
Well, there's no hurry, Roman.
Maybe I should spend less time at the cemetery.
The only thing is that Nadiya and Olena are there.
They can't leave.
So I go there and visit them because they can't go anywhere.
They can't.
I mean, on the other hand, I need to take care of things around here.
I need to clean up.
I mean I should be doing things right now.
Of course, I'll leave you to it.
You take care, Roman.
Of course I love you, Jake.
I think this is best for Samuel and for us and I really hope it's best for you, too.
What, I can't even say goodbye to him?
Honey, you don't have to say goodbye.
I just told him we were gonna spend...
You know, he loves having the dog and the cats around.
He's not gonna understand that.
He will, not right now, but he will eventually.
We'll just make it normal for him.
Jake I think you just need some time to focus on you.
Because if we keep living like this I think we'll just keep hurting each other and you know, we'll get to a point where I don't know if we can fix it.
So we're gonna do this for Samuel.
And for us.
Okay?
Yeah, for Samuel.
That's the Springfield Armory.
Eleven plus one rounds $674.
Three, two-inch Berettas ten plus one rounds, will run you about $570.
Now, the two Smith  Wesson models we have the black MP eight plus one rounds, will run you about $560 and the Air-weight 38 special it's got more of a classic air and a stainless steel finish so that's gonna run you about $436.
Mr. Bonanos, can we speak with you for a moment?
Jake.
How you doing, Jake?
Yeah, sure.
We're thinking of you, Jake.
This is the second time I've offered but we all agree you could use some psychological support.
I know Christina agrees with us on that one.
Yeah, right.
And as far as work goes, there are several options.
You could stay here doing administrative work.
I don't know.
Or we could also offer you another possibility.
Only if you're interested, of course, but the severance package that we could offer you could be very advantageous.
Management, they always recommend what's best for the worker but in your particular case in order to guarantee your safety, it may be in your best interest if you were to consider making a change.
A radical change, Jake.
The safest isn't just another job, it's another city.
Another life.
That's okay, that's okay.
I can't just we can't just up and move, you know?
This may potentially be the safest thing to do for you and your family.
You really have to consider what we're presenting to you right now.
Think about their best interest and their well being.
I don't think you know the lawyers representing the airlines,
John and James Gullick.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
The meetings with the victims' families have been carrying over these days.
That's okay.
Allow me to say that most have been very fruitful.
To reach an agreement.
Mr. Melnyk, you are the only family member who has chosen to sue the company by himself without a lawyer and without signing up with any of the victims' associations.
I'd like you to know that you have our complete respect and that to us it makes no difference.
Our proposal will be exactly the same.
Now, in exchange, the company will take care of your family's funeral expenses and any medical or psychological treatment that may have been deemed necessary to date.
The company also agrees to pay you damages in the amount of $75,000 for your daughter's death and $85,000 for your wife's.
There are also some minor clauses in the contract.
For example, you will automatically receive premium client status from the airline within our group.
You'll be able to benefit from those and other advantages.
These are details that you should read carefully because they are clearly explained in the contract.
I would like for someone to say that they're sorry for killing my family.
I want the company to apologize.
Now $160,000 is a lot of money.
Someone in your position shouldn't turn down such an offer.
Look at this photo.
Because you didn't before.
Look at it.
Look at it!
Where's your mind right now?
Still feel like you're unable to engage with your family?
Still feeling pensive?
Well, today let's try to focus on the positive feelings you've had this week.
On those moments when you feel at ease maybe doing something you find satisfying.
It may seem silly, but makes you feel good.
Think about your daily routine.
At home, places you go, people you see on a weekly basis.
I really just want the prescription.
A stroll, a TV program...
So just give me the fucking pills, please.
Or I'll go down the street and rob the goddamned pharmacy.
"And these will go away into eternal punishment but the righteous into eternal life."
That eternal life which Matthew spoke of, that feeling that tells us our loved ones are somewhere else, somewhere better is the feeling that must prevail on a day like today.
One year ago we were struck by a tragic event.
Many lives were lost unjustly incomprehensibly and unexpectedly.
But today the spirits of the people we lost are somewhere else, watching us.
And they can see that on a day like today, we remember them and pay tribute to them.
And to keep this memory alive, to keep it ingrained inside of us and in this place today we inaugurate this monument this Memorial to the Victims.
Roman Melnyk?
I'm Andrew Berg.
I lost my wife and my in-laws in the accident.
I'm very sorry.
I read the story in the papers about your daughter's necklace.
I thought it was nice that they used it as inspiration for the monument.
Do you like it?
Yes.
What do you...
I get up in the morning and I don't know what to do.
Maybe it's not that I don't know what to do the whole day, it's that I don't know what to do in the next hour or the next minute.
I'm sorry, I'm being so honest.
That's okay.
Go ahead.
Sometimes I try to think of things to distract me you know, just try and think about something else then I immediately forget and I don't do them.
I just sit at home, not knowing what to do.
It won't be easy but sooner or later you will find something that'll help you get out of bed.
You think so?
I know so.
Be patient.
That's what I need, dammit.
Have you gotten through it?
It's a wonderful place and in the northern tip of the Yucatan Peninsula.
Is that something you guys seem like you're interested in?
There's a cruise ship leaving out of Florida and it heads just straight down there.
Let me get some of your information I'll get you guys started.
How's it going?
Thanks.
You're doing a great job.
Thanks.
If I liked the fence that my wife picked out it'd be amazing.
Bye, guys.
I want you to help me find him.
I'm coming to town, is there somewhere we could meet?
That's why I don't wanna ask you anything specific.
I'm not talking about an interview or photographs.
I just wanna give you a chance to say something.
Add a comment, a thought?
Or to not say anything at all, if that's what you want.
You know sometimes I sometimes I put myself in their shoes.
You know, the families'.
And then I think about my son and my wife and it scares me to death it's terrifying.
I mean, what can I say?
You know, I I just want this pain inside of me to go away.
So, tell them...
Look, I'm not a bad person.
Right?
Hi.
He put his house up for sale and moved to another state.
He works at a travel agency four blocks away from his new apartment.
And what's his address?
I don't know if I should give you that.
What's wrong?
I'd like you to use this information in the correct way.
There is no correct way or incorrect way.
It's not that simple.
I told you I just want to look him in the eye.
Show him a photograph of my family.
I want him to apologize.
Pat Dealbert.
Pat Dealbert?
His name is Pat Dealbert now.
Where are you going?
Goodbye.
Is Pat Dealbert home?
He sure is, that's me.
I'm glad you're here.
Okay, let me get your stuff.
We were rehearsing his lines the whole way here.
I'm just finishing up dinner, you guys make yourselves at home.
Yeah.
So who did you tell him Pat Dealbert was?
I told him it was like Clark Kent or Bruce Wayne.
A name you told people so they wouldn't know the truth that you're a superhero.
Yeah, at first, he said it was stupid, but then he thought it was kind of funny.
Yeah.
How have you been feeling?
Honestly?
Alone.
This whole kind of place feels unnatural.
You know, I have days that I wake up and I feel like things are getting better and the next day I wake up it just kind of feels like things are getting worse.
Well, I'm I'm sure it'll take time.
Move here.
Quit your job and move here, you and Samuel.
Yeah, this'd be a great place for all of us to get a fresh start.
And we could all be super heroes.
I think we just need to to take it slow.
You know, I think it's better.
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.
I made the bed for you guys so I'm gonna sleep on the sofa tonight.
What?
I just thought that was the plan.
I guess my plan was we could all fit in one bed, the three of us.
Okay, well, then my plan is no longer my plan.
Good.
Jake.
Hello?
I love it.
I think it all depends on this card.
Please?
Alright, it'll be a really quick game, okay?
Yes?
Can I help you?
Look at this photo.
This is my family!
You killed them!
What have you lost your mind?
I'm gonna call the police right now, you need to leave!
Have you lost your mind?
You hear me?
Stay here.
Olena, stay back.
Stay back.
Mommy?
Nadiya.
Don't be afraid.
He did not know that the new life would not be given to him for nothing that he would have to pay dearly for it that it would cost him great strife and great suffering.
But that, that is the beginning of a new story.
The story of the renewal of a man the story of his gradual regeneration of his passing from one world into another.
Roman, let's go.
So they agreed to review the sentence and apply the extenuating circumstances we presented.
To be honest, Roman, I didn't expect them to reduce the sentence so drastically.
It's been ten years and you could get parole in four months.
You'll have to visit a psychiatrist three times a week who will write up monthly reports on your progress.
If you go to every session and those reports are positive you might not have to go back to prison, Roman.
Hi.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm heading that way anyway, come.
Thank you.
Yeah, I've never been here before.
Last time I was here was 11 years ago.
Long time.
Everything is exactly the same.
Nothing has changed since the first time I came.
The same trees the same smell of thyme.
Same everything.
Oh, yeah?
Smells like thyme to me.
But it isn't.
You have family members here?
No.
My father isn't buried here.
You know, when I was following you I didn't know exactly when to approach you, where'd be the best place.
But when I saw you get on that bus this morning and I realized you were coming here I thought the perfect place for this to end.
Wait.
Turn around.
Turn around!
Go ahead.
Do what you have to do.
I understand.
But I want you to know that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for what I did.
I could do it.
But I'm not going to.
It's not what I was taught.
Will you just go, please?
Okay.
