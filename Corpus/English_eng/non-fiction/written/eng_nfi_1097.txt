What are you doing?
- Hey.

Um, my sister's coming.
All right.
The judgmental one or the pretty one?
They're the same sister.
Right, right.
Well, I always liked her.

- so I'm gonna talk you up, girl.

Yeah, I'm gonna make you look awesome.
Okay, just in case it comes up, but I'm sure that it won't...
She hates you now.
- She what?

Hold on.
What are you talking about?
We gotta go.
Wha...

Hey, you're gonna miss your bus.
- Who got popped?

Man!
This isn't one of us.

You know, that sleaze bag videographer.
Yeah.
.22's his, but this is no suicide.
The entry wound is in the center of his face.
And there's no contact wound.
People don't wanna see it coming.
He's got half a dozen puncture wounds.
Shallow, sporadic.

We talked to one of Bobby's stringers, who was out here shooting crime scenes last night.
He didn't know if Bobby was working but there were three shootings in the area,
- so he might have been.

I don't want anyone else near it until it's towed.
Hey, you and Ruzek canvas the area.

- Yeah.

Bobby was working.

Right.
- Yo, Sarge.

Bobby's daughter was actually the one who found him.
Her name is Margot.
Says she's not leaving till she talks to whoever's in charge.
Margot?
Hey, can you give us a minute, please?
Hi, Margot.

One of my officers said you wanted to talk to me.
Yeah, um, do you know my dad?
Not well.
Most cops hate that he films what he films.
They don't think he's worth much.
Listen, your father was just doing his job.
My job is to find out what happened to him.
I've been working for him.
This morning, I was logging footage and I knew something was wrong.
We all share our locations for work.
And he said he was here.
I thought he must be working a scene.
And why'd you know something must be wrong?
Because I didn't have access.
His computer, our servers...

Clear.
Clear.
Well, someone did not like Bobby Trent.
Everything electronic is destroyed.
There's gonna be nothing left but dust.
I think that's the point.
Somebody wanted everything gone.
Got something.
All we have is a video file.

They have no idea they're being filmed.
Maybe Bobby got off on this.
Or maybe this is what got him killed.
Bobby Trent, 41 years old.
Was a freelance videographer at crime scenes.
Sold footage to all the major news affiliates.
He was found at 6:12 a.m.
Single .22 caliber gunshot to the face.
Ballistics match Bobby's gun.
Estimated time of death between 10:30 and midnight.
The ME thinks that the seven puncture wounds to Bobby's chest and stomach came after the shot.
They're very in depth, but they're all with the same blade.
Small, shallow.

His phone locations show he left his loft, drove straight there, arrived at 10:21 p.m., but the closest crime scene is three blocks away.
And forensics has no trace evidence to work with.
No prints on the gun.

- wore gloves, so...

Yeah, in a very large pool.
I mean, think about it.

Victims, victims' families, news affiliates
- sending him hate mail.

He's not on speaking terms with any of them.
Five restraining orders filed in the past two years and a history of drugs and alcohol.
Speed, cocaine.
He's been in and out of NA for a decade.
Right, and our video?
There's no ID on the woman.

The guy, he's a total no go.
He never looks directly at the camera, he's got no defining characteristics, as far as I can tell.
Well, every other drive in Bobby's house was destroyed.
And most of his personal files are nixed, but he did back up a lot of footage on his iCloud.
- Mama!

- What happened?

I'm okay, go inside.
- Run, baby, run, go inside.

- What happened?

No, Mama, you can't!

No!
- Hank?

Um, Margot Trent's here.
Okay, we all know who this guy is.
We all crossed paths with him.
Doesn't matter.

Lindsay.
No, no, I've never seen her.
You have any idea why your dad would hide footage?
Had he done that before?
I don't think so.
And would he have a reason to?
He could be paranoid sometimes.
What was he paranoid about?
Maybe paranoid's the wrong word.
He was careful.
What about a girlfriend?
I don't...

You never saw him with anybody?
I only just got back in touch with him six months ago.
If he had a girlfriend, I wouldn't be the one to know about it.
- Okay, who would be?

He didn't have people like that.
I grew up eight miles from him.
I would send him letters, school projects, photos, try and call.
He'd FedEx me a present on my birthday.
I was his own daughter, and I didn't even know him.
Come on.
Excuse me, are you Sergeant Trudy Platt?
Yeah, that's me.
I'm Nicole Silver, Kim Burgess' sister.
I've heard a lot about you.
Well, you know, Kim...

I doubt that.
I just wanna thank you.
She always says how much you taught her, how you helped her get into Intelligence.

Sh... she said this?
Yeah.
Well, hey, let me show you upstairs.
- You want some coffee?

Hey, Burgess, look who's here.
- Hey!

I told you to call me when you got here.
- It was so nice to meet you, Nicole.

Have a great day.
Nicole, hey.
How are you?
How you doing?
Hey.
I was...
- It's Adam, remember?

I last saw you at your husband's birthday.
I remember you.

Let's go get coffee.
- We're gonna get coffee.

So out of all the hate mail that I ran through from Bobby's news affiliates, one popped.
Gangbanger from the West Side named AJ Hines.
He used to live three blocks away from where we found Bobby.
I've caught him on two crime scenes and mouthing off.
All the hate on social media's pretty loud.
He actually put a hit out on Bobby on Facebook like four months ago.
You got an address?
No, he moved, and I can't confirm the new address, but.
AJHin0300 is snapchatting the hell out of Michigan Avenue.
Wanna go get him?
- Yes, please.

Blue skull cap, right in front of you.
AJ Hines.
What?

I'm looking for you, dawg.
Hey, hey, hey!
5021 Ida, emergency.

Stop!
- Chicago PD!

- Yeah, I'm fine.

Yeah.
Hey!
AJ, come on, man.
- No!

Hey!
Stay down!
Get your hands up there, yeah.
Whoa, Bobby Trent?
That's why I'm here?
I got zero clue about what happened to him.
You know, it makes it a lot harder to believe that when you run.
I ran because I haven't been paying spousal support.
I ain't about to go to jail
- for that bitch.

Then how do you explain this?
'Cause on Facebook, looks like you got a lot of beef with Bobby Trent.
Hell yeah, we got beef.
It was justified.
Bobby was a vulture, white guy coming into our neighborhood, making cash off our dead.
I was doing a public service checking him.
But that beef's over.
How's that?
I been working with Bobby.
He hired me to shoot the West Side a couple months ago.
So a little bit of money and that righteousness just goes right out the window?
No, I came around to his way of thinking.
Your neighborhood's going up in flames, the least you can do is make the rest of the world look it in the eye, and, yeah, the money wasn't bad.
Sarge?
So facial recognition IDed the woman in the video.
Her name is Sarah Jaines.
She was arrested a few years ago for trespassing.
- Well, you got an address?

Full name is Sarah Jaines-Huntley.
- Huntley, as in...

I'll notify the Huntleys.
- You can wait in here.

Are you the police?
You're here about Sarah, aren't you?
Is she dead?
I'm Jessica Huntley.

I'm Hank Voight.

We're looking for your daughter, Sarah.
Our daughter doesn't live here anymore.
What's wrong with Sarah?
Just trying to find her.
So where's she living now?
We don't know.
You're gonna have to elaborate.
Sarah's an addict, has been for a very long time.
Last year, we took our therapist's advice
- and cut her off.

You know how I can get ahold of her?
No, we have no contact.
Not even a cell phone?

No one's been keeping tabs on her?
We severed all ties.
Tough love, it's what they told us to do.
Do any of you know a man named Bobby Trent?
No, no, I don't.
Should I?
Is our daughter in trouble?
- We're not sure yet.

She is.
Sarah Jaines-Huntley, 30.
She spent a year at a very prestigious college, and then spent a lot of time in and out of very expensive rehab facilities.
There is nothing to cross her with Bobby except maybe the drugs.
This guy has one file hidden in the middle of his wall, and it just so happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest men in Chicago?
My money's on Bobby was stalking her.
He found out who she was.

Well, I am pulling up zero.
There's no current address for Sarah Huntley or Jaines, and nothing to date appears online.
There's no social media, no car, no bank account, no credit cards.

Thank you very much.
All right, so the last cell phone that Sarah Jaines had was cut off six months ago because of failed payments.
Now, the records show that she was sticking to Humboldt Park.
The cell was hitting towers in Humboldt Park every day, but once a week in Rogers Park.
Rogers Park?

Take it.
Yo, Sarge, you got a sec?
Yeah, come on in.
Check this out.
This is the little girl that Bobby recoded at the crime scene.
My dad said it was 'cause he had the wrong friends, but I looked it up.
He was driving some car when some guy got shot.
Her name is Taja Bowes.
Bobby interviewed her here, and then again and again.
Right here, she's talking about losing her mom, her dad in prison, the neighborhood, but he's got, like, over 30 hours on it.
I mean, I don't know if it's gonna mean anything.
- No, it's good, chase it.

- Good.

Sarah Huntley?
I'm sorry, people you meet here die, but they don't get killed.

It's okay.
We just need to get some background on Bobby.
- Yeah.

Um, here, we met here.
Were you guys friends?
Um, we'd smoke after meetings sometimes.
I liked him.
Sarah, I need to show you something.
We found this in Bobby's belongings.
What...

We don't know.
This is all that we found, but he hid this.
You didn't know that he was filming you?
No.
Why would he be filming me?
Did he ever show any romantic interest?
No.
Okay, who's the guy in the video?
That's my ex, Stephen Childs.
They teach you to make amends.
That's me doing a poor-ass version of that.
It looks pretty heated for amends.
Yeah, well, drugs aren't loyal.
They screw you and they screw everyone you love.
Apologizing doesn't mean you get forgiveness.
Do you mind giving us some info in case we have to contact you?
You called me Sarah Huntley.
Did you see my family?
It seemed like they really missed you.
I'm saying we do a different pizza every week.
This week, Pizano's, next week, Pequod's.
That way, we won't get sick of it.
Your arteries will get sick of it.
No, I'm with you, Zo, pizza once a week, easy.
Okay, so we'll do it every Friday.
I mean, for as long as we're down here.
What does she mean, "as long as we're down here"?
Come on, pizza's getting cold.
Nicole.
Zoe and I are staying here for a while.
Me and Jordan, we're getting divorced.
- What?

I mean, everything's fine.
What happened?
Just decided a couple months ago, and we don't need to get into details now.
But you always tell me everything's fine.
Yeah, well, you don't tell me everything.
But this is a big thing not to tell...
Kim, I don't want to get into it now.
I can't.
I just wanna hang out with my sister and my friends for the weekend and have fun.
That's all, okay?
Everything's fine.
The guy in the video is Stephen Childs,
Sarah's ex.

No priors.

He's abroad, currently, but we're tracking him down.
I got Bobby's financials.
So this month, Bobby made three cash deposits into his bank account in three days.
Each just shy of 10 grand.

Most a new affiliate ever paid Bobby for his footage
- was 1,200 bucks.

Run with it.
Track the dates of the payments with his email and phone records, and dig into Stephen's financials, see if it came from him.
Hey, computer forensics is done with the video.
You guys wanna see some high tech work?
You guys take it.

Your drive wasn't used much.
The past three months, it only ever had two files on it.
- Two?

There was a second file, someone removed it manually two days ago at 9:54 p.m.
Can't tell you much about it, though.

Now keep your eye on that SUV.
There.
Damn, that's her dad.
Well, Sarah's lying.
Everybody is.
Thanks.
Sarah's in the wind.
Patrol went to the address she gave us, and she cleared out.
The second file on that drive has gotta be our missing piece.
Bobby removed it from the drive an hour before he died.
So if it's another interaction with her dad, or a continuation of what's on the video,
Bobby could've been using it to blackmail.
Yeah, blackmail for what?
Maybe he follows her, he roughs her up, uses with her.
We gotta bring him in to find out.
No, you don't bring a man like that in to chat.
I mean, you know, you'll get nothing, and, while you're chatting, his team is scrubbing any evidence.
So find Sarah first, okay?
Tap into cameras, circulate her photo, get every copper on the street looking for her.
And get a subpoena on Calvin's financials, but make sure it includes a directive not to disclose,
- you understand?

Till we know what's on that second file, we step light.
Find her.
- Yo, Sarge.

DCFS tracked down the little girl that Bobby recorded, Taja Bowes.
She lives in a foster home in Garfield Park.
- You and me.

So you're police officers?
Yes, we are.

- This is my sergeant, Hank Voight.

And we were hoping you could help us out a little bit, Taja.
- You know Bobby Trent, right?

He filmed my mom dying, then he did a documentary on me.
He did a documentary on you?
- Yeah, I play the piano.

Do remember the last time you saw Bobby?
Tuesday.

Did he say anything that seemed different, or did he seem different?
- He still seemed kind of sad.

He told me he got his heart broken.
It was a couple months ago, but I don't think that stuff goes away right away.

That does help.
Thank you, Taja.
I know who Bobby was.
What his job was.
She takes piano lessons with the $2.00 checks that her dad makes working in prison, but when you hear her, Bobby said it gave him a little bit of light.
Sarge, we got something on Sarah.
- Thank you very much.

So I pulled all the traffic cameras within a mile radius of Sarah's apartment.
Pods caught her getting picked up three blocks from her place in a black town car, no less.
Followed the cameras all the way here.
She's staying in the Kaminsky suite.
- Hi.

Penthouse suite.

- My dad booked it.

Why?
I told you that I'm making amends, so my dad's gonna let me come home.
We were meeting to talk.
Or maybe you called him for help?
We know someone was paying Bobby off.
Were you and Bobby blackmailing your dad?
What?

No, of course not.
Sarah, you and your dad both lied to us.
That's him in the video.

I'm sorry, I...

I...

I forgot that I took my dad there.
Look, I didn't know Bobby was filming me.
Why do you think that I'm lying to you?
Because I'm an addict?
No, but it makes you good at it.
Look, I've apologized to a hell of a lot of people.
I-I thought that was Stephen.
No, you didn't.
And Bobby wasn't just your buddy from meetings.
You broke his heart.
No, I-I-I didn't think that that was worth mentioning.
Just...

We were both desperate and trying to get clean.
- It burned out quick.

Four hours after we spoke, you packed up and you moved to a suite that your dad paid for.
You think we're just gonna believe that that's a coincidence?
Were you and Bobby blackmailing your dad?
No, no!

I don't know what to tell you, but I...
After you showed up, yes, I called my dad because I was scared.
We can hold you for 48 hours.
Get comfortable.
Well, there's nothing in Sarah's financials that suggests that she got paid out.
Bobby's phone records match her story.
They stopped talking three months ago.
One month later, blackmail payments get started.
Well, she and the Huntleys confirmed that she was cut off a year ago, which financially checks out, but they sent Sarah to live with her mother's distant cousin, so she hasn't lived with the family since she was a kid.
Well, they're a family of means;

Yeah, but it's not how they parented her brother.
He went to school three blocks from the house, and her therapy/rehab didn't start till she was 19.
They iced her out way before that.
Okay.

They need us down there right now.
Yeah.
Found it when we cut him open.
Luckily hadn't gotten too far into his stomach.
When you die, your stomach's still digesting.
Gut bacteria actually starts to eat you, but it hadn't gotten that far.
I'm sorry, you found what?
Your boy swallowed it right before he was shot.
All right, now whoever killed him was looking for this.
This is our second file.
Well, it's not a video file.

It's 46 seconds.

What he hell do you want from me?
What do I want?

For you to even admit that you did something...
- That was long time ago.

- Sarah...

What you did...
- I was sick!

- Calm down, you're in a public place.

I don't have to calm down.

I admitted to you that I was sick!
- That's not sick!

You raped me.
I was nine.
You're my dad.

Calm down, I'm sorry, okay?

What do you want from me?
- I was sick!

Calm down, you're in a public place.
I don't care.

You won't even admit...
I admitted to you that I was sick!
- That's not sick!

- Stop it.

Sarah...
I understand why you didn't wanna tell us what was on this video, and I'm so sorry...
But you've gotta understand that, from where I'm sitting, this is enough for Bobby to blackmail your father.
If that's what he was doing, I didn't know.
If you didn't know he was filming you, okay, fine.
But the minute that I showed you this video, you knew what it was, and you had to know that Bobby was using it to blackmail your dad.
That's why you called your dad as soon as we left.
Bobby shouldn't have filmed it.
If I'd known he was gonna film it, I would've...
You would've what?
Sarah, this video...
This ruins your family business.
This is worth millions of dollars.
This is motive.
I don't know anything.
I mean, I can take another run at her, but I don't know that we're gonna crack through whatever loyalty or fear he built in her without more.
Then we move without her.
Bobby's sleeping with Sarah, he finds out who she really is and what happened.
He convinces her to confront her father, films the whole thing without her knowledge, and then he goes to shake Calvin down.
He reaches too high, and Calvin takes care of him.
We don't have evidence for that in Calvin's financials, not yet.

We got the guy on tape admitting
- that he raped his daughter.

We can't have 99.9.
I mean, we need 100%.
Yeah.
Jay.
Trouble at home?
No, we're just working some stuff out.
I heard all that before.

I want both you, so clear it up, get back to doing your job, or you're gone.

Yeah.
My client will not answer any questions regarding any allegations or any appearance of a confession on a video tape.
As a show of faith, however, he is willing to speak on his relationship with Bobby Trent, but, be aware,
I will shut you down the moment you make any attempts...
Yeah, are we about done here?
Yeah, go ahead.
So we're operating on faith here, Cal?
Go ahead.
Tell me what you want me to know.
Bobby sent me the tape two months ago with a note saying the audio would be released if I didn't pay.
I paid.

See, I know where you grew up.
I came out of Cicero.
Know what we used to call you guys?
Junkyard dogs.
Yeah, we'd ask "How are you?"
You'd say, "Why the hell you wanna know?"
See, I'm guessing for a guy like you, even after all these years being under someone's thumb, it just felt wrong.
I would've kept paying.
Yeah, if the footage was released...
Now your family business earns, what, 600 mil a year?
And its CEO is being accused of raping
- his nine-year-old daughter.

My client is not gonna sit here and listen to any more of this.
That's enough.

- Enough.

I never heard from Bobby after the second payment.
I'm happy to share all our correspondence with you.
Thursday night, I was with my wife, and my friend Miles, a junkyard dog, will confirm that.
All right.
You keep smiling, Cal.
You know, the nice thing about my job, no matter how much money you have,
I land every killer in the exact same place.
You say so.
His lawyer's playing it right.
Even if Sarah gave you a statement for the rape, which would've been necessary for a charge, the abuse occurred 22 years ago in a state with a statute of limitations that's 20.
You have to get him on the murder.
Calvin's financials show that his assistant withdrew the 60 grand from Calvin's son's college fund and FedExed it to Bobby.
- Burgess.

Both Jessica and his friend Miles confirmed that Calvin was home all night.
Could the killer have been hired?
No, it was too sloppy.
The killer was in the car, gave Bobby time to struggle.
Sergeant, Calvin's lawyer Williams is downstairs insisting Sarah see a lawyer.
Well, he can insist all he want.

It's a conflict of interest.
Yeah, he's got another attorney with him.
Insists Sarah's her client.
You have to let her lawyer upstairs then.
We need to talk to her first.
Stall them.
You can't do that, Hank.
Stall them.
Your lawyer's downstairs.
Or your dad's lawyer, I should say.
Your dad is in the next room.
By law, I have to let your lawyer up here unless you tell me not to, or you can sign this waiver and just talk to me.
I don't understand.
Sarah, you could've asked me for a lawyer at any time,
- but you didn't.

It's family.
My mom never even told me who my dad is.
It was always just me and her, and she was a terrible parent.
She failed me every time, and I took it because I didn't have a choice.
She was all I knew, all I had.
So I stand there in front of her, and I take it on the chin.
And every single hit has hurt.
So I look at you, and I look at what you're going through, and I think to myself, "There's gotta be a time where we stop standing up for more."
He's gonna let me come home to my brother... and my mom.
It's my family.
I'll lose all of them.
Did you ever really have them?
Sarah...
Did your dad kill Bobby?
Can you provide an explanation...
- You'll see.

Where's her lawyer?
She waived her right.
Now, this is a copy of her statement.
It details the rape when she was nine years old.
Can I take a look at that statement?
You'll get it in discovery in three months.
It also covers your confrontation months ago, and your promise in your hotel suite to let her come home.
I know the law.

I knew as soon as I saw the tape, but I just...
I called my dad right after you showed it to me.
He sent me the car, and it took me to the hotel, and he met me there.
- This is ridiculous.

I confronted him.
I...

She's lying.
Cal, stop talking.
Yeah, Bobby made quite an impression on your daughter.
Yeah, he was paranoid, convinced her to be too.
Taught her to record everything.
I know what you did!
He was my friend, and you took him too, you just...
I made a decision, Sarah.

So why don't you make one right now.
What do you want?

You wanna... you wanna destroy this family?
Or do you wanna come home?
'Cause we can make that deal right now.
I love you, sweetheart.
Come home.
Couldn't that have been altered?
No, we got the original this time.
And Sarah's gonna testify to all of it.
We're done.
You're done.
Turn around.
What do we do here?
Hey, that's fine, that's fine.
You don't wanna turn around, that's okay.
'Cause I'd like nothing more than to shove your face in the floor.
Turn around, Cal.
Cal, turn around.
You do not say a word to anybody, not anybody, do you hear me?

That's the next time you will talk.
- Do you understand me?

Um, hey, look...
I don't want to tiptoe around you at work.
That's not us, and I...
I think I just...
I need some time right now.
Yeah, I do too.
Thank God for the job though, right?
I mean, every day you get to meet somebody whose problems are bigger than yours.
Yeah, I guess so.
I got Sarah into a 90-day rehab facility, so I'm gonna go get her checked in.
My dad's never heard me play, but he writes me a couple times a week.
He says he doesn't have to hear it.
He knows I must be good.
What are you wearing?

Yeah, I know.

I was thinking today was so long that maybe
I'd just...

I should stay in too, shouldn't I?
No, you should go to the birthday.
If you need a day, a night, or a weekend, you should have it.
All this is gonna be here in the morning.
I love you.
I love you too.
- Have fun.

- That's an order.

I thought I was staying home alone tonight.
Not a chance, sorry.
I'm gonna change into my pajamas, and then we're gonna order an obscene amount of pizza, and then we're gonna talk about how much it sucks that your parents are getting divorced.
And that whatever we stupid adults do, or however bad it seems right now,
you're gonna be just fine.
Okay?

Let's get pizza.
- You Hank Voight?

You realize it's your ass if this goes south?
I get it.
Hey, man, come on out.
There you go.
You the guy that swung me the day pass?
That's right.
Why?
Little bit of light.
Come on.
