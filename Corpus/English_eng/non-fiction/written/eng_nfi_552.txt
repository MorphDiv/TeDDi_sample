- Previously on The Originals...

And since I am on the most-wanted list of every psycho who wants your family dead,
I guess I'm Team Mikaelson, whether I like it or not.
ZEALOT:

And now it must be fed.
[screaming]
- I had a bad dream.

VINCENT:

I've seen before.

It means the Hollow.

The Hollow wants power.
The kind that only comes from sacrifice.
VINCENT:

Everything that you want to keep buried... it's going to use that and make you do exactly what it wants you to do.
They wanted us here.
They want to channel your power and anchor the Hollow to the living world.
LARA:

[screaming]
It's here.
The Hollow.
[panting]
It's here.

You didn't come back to your place last night.
What's going on?
I just spent the last six hours going to every palm reader, exorcist and witch doctor I know.
Now, they all say I'm fine, but ever since the bayou, something is off.
What do you mean "off"?
The mirror cracked in the exact shape of the sigil we've seen all over town.
We killed witches who follow that.
They tried to anchor it to our world.
Now I think...
I think it's anchored to me.
Then you need a witch.
A good one.

Yeah, I need a New Orleans witch.
Vincent has a history with this thing, and this thing did just kill his friend, so I think he'll help me.
And in the meantime, I'm supposed to do what?
Cross my fingers and hope you're not possessed?
That's not gonna happen to me.
Good.
'Cause I'm not letting you out of my sight until you're cured.
KLAUS:

Hope?

We're ready to go.

KLAUS:

My daughter nearly died.
I have to make sure the threat to her is over.
Not without me you cannot.
Brother, hearcel loathes you most of all.
Freya will help me here.

[sighs]
Mm.
Is this for me?
Oh, sweet angel of mercy.
Mmm.

Oh, let's not forget, that whole kidnapping thing kept you alive.
As for the coffee, it's the least I could do, considering you helped us make our breakthrough.
The last I remember was... you saying you figured it out, and then we started drinking tequila like water.
So how am I borderline comatose, and you're Little Miss Sunshine?
Because of this: hangover cure.
Thousand years old.
Also, because... mission accomplished.
Do you really think that weapon could kill Marcel?
It took some time, my blood, Esther's magic,
Marcel's venom and the ashes of Lucien Castle.
Combined, it will be powerful enough to kill him.
So, we're done, then?
Yeah, I go back to my life, you go back to yours?
Yeah.
A deal's a deal.
Hey, look, don't look so disappointed.
I mean, this wasn't exactly built to be a long-term friendship.
I guess this is good-bye.
Like you said, mission accomplished.
Okay.

Okay.
[phone chimes]
Vincent, it's me, again.
We were supposed to meet an hour ago.
All right, call me back as soon as you get this.
This is absurd.

All right, whoever you are, this is the wrong day to be playing games.
Elijah.
What are you doing here?
Did you not learn your lesson the last time I put you down?
Does this bravado help to relieve your pathetic fear?
Oh, you think I'm afraid of you?
Terrified.
I put you down twice before.
Maybe the third time's the charm.
The spirit I have seen may be the devil, and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape.
Do you not recall your Shakespeare, Marcellus?
The ghost which appeared to Hamlet.
And then, of course... unrelenting tragedy.
You're not Elijah.
[ship horn blows]
Tell me again what happened at this ritual.
I fought evil, and I saved children.
I should be given a medal.
Instead, I've been infected by some depraved ghost.
Well, I know purging spells and cleansing rituals, so I can fix this.
In the meantime, have you considered that you're not the only one infected?
Marcel was exposed, as well.
In your visions, our father's goading you to kill your enemy.
If Marcel has seen something similar...
Then we're all on the chopping block.
I need to purify you both.
No!

If the Hollow can look into me, then I can look back at it, find out what it is, what it wants.
It's too dangerous, Klaus.
This thing came after Hope.
Fine.
I'll give you an hour.
And something else.
The means to kill the unkillable king of New Orleans.
If Marcel comes after you, use this.
Oh.

Fine.
Chastise me once you've made it through the day.
HAYLEY:

ELIJAH:

You know, we could be happy out here.
I think you might stand out in that suit.
Well, I was thinking jeans, shorts and flip flops.
I want to build a life with you, Elijah.
With Hope.
I want us to be happy.
So we do that.
Together.
In jean shorts.
[knocking on door]
- HOPE:

Oh, my girl.

HOPE:

Honey darling, why don't you run on inside.
I need to talk to your mama.
Didn't know you were bringing him.
Mary, come on.
Vampires aren't welcome.
You're the exception.
Rules of the house.
I'll leave you two.
Seriously?
You know how I feel.
Our kind winds up dead when they're around.
Yesterday, we lost Lara.
I wake up to hear there's been some kind of occult massacre in the woods.
Let me guess...
Mikaelsons are involved.
That's why I'm here.
I want to talk about what really caused that massacre last night.
So young.
And taken before her time.
While those immortal tyrants continue to wander free.
What is this?
Evil spirit appears to me as the guy I hate, for what?
Huh?

If this is all in my head,
I could just as easily wish your ass away.
Your wishes won't bring back the dead.
Nor will they grant you solace.
Let's not forget, Elijah killed you as well.
Can you close your eyes and wish that away?
I betrayed you without a second thought.
Give in to your desire.
Seize your revenge.
Why not start with me?
What do you get out of me killing Klaus?
Is this just a game?
It is a game.

You are here to deliver a sacrifice.
Either Klaus or you.
Two powerful souls, both fighting to the death.
Now, doesn't that sound wonderful?
[grunts] Marcel!

Hey.

I knew this was bad.
I have a witch on the way.
You're coming with me.
We're gonna fix you.

MIKAEL [echoing]:

I assumed you'd run.
Like the pathetic, sniveling coward that you are.
And I assume I have the misfortune of addressing the, uh...
What was your name?
The inept?
The vacant?
The Hollow.

You address no one.
I am not here.
[whispers]:

I can see your worst fear:
the father that you loathed, the terror that this is how your daughter may one day perceive you.
A depraved demon sputtering psychoanalysis?
Perhaps you speak from personal experience.
Do you come from a broken home?
Daddy drank?
Mommy never loved you?
You seem to think Marcel will kill me today.
But he's had five years to do that.
He didn't do it then.

I, however, have long had the will to end him.
Now I have the weapon.
Eager boy.
You have shown that you have a talent for brutality.
But can you summon that same beast to do what is necessary today?
When your once-beloved son comes to finish you, will you kill him?
Or die a coward?
Let's find out, shall we?
[brass band playing lively jazz music]
Forget something?
Yeah.

I was halfway to the bus station, and I realized that you're here alone,
Marcel is still alive, and I'm bailing on you.
And, all things considered, you did cure me of my curse, so... let's see this thing through.
Well,
I appreciate that, but, um, as usual,
I'm in the middle of a family crisis.
What'd they get into now?
Last night, Klaus was infected by dark magic, unlike any I've ever seen.
This totem represents that power, and the only way to figure out how to heal him is to channel it, which will give it access to me.
That sounds safe.
Okay, look, not to tell you how to handle your sorcery, but you haven't slept in days, you're dehydrated, stressed.
I don't have a choice.
Okay.

That's what friends do, right?
All we know is this cult wanted to sacrifice children.
Somehow Lara got caught up in it, and when she tried to get out, she couldn't, and she killed herself.
Doesn't make sense.
Someone is recruiting Crescents into a cult?
That's what I need you to look out for, Mary...
Anything strange.
These people obsess over specific imagery.
It's a... serpent eating its own tail.
What'd you say?
A serpent.

When Hope was affected, she drew some.
Here.
There's something you need to see.
MARCEL [quietly]:

Loyalty is good for business, and I give him a lot of business.
This spirit... it's ancient.
It ebbs and flows like the tide, feeding and sleeping.
So, it's awake, and I'm lunch.
Well, it wants power.
You're powerful.
Right now it's stuck, caught between the world of the living and... wherever it was trapped.
Was trappe?
It broke free.
Some time ago, there must have been a massive release of energy.
The Ancestral Realm.
When Vincent blew the link, he must've set it free.
How do we get this thing off Marcel?
Purification could work.
Unless it comes back.
Best bet, you'll have to send this thing back to sleep.
See, spirits are just another form of power.
They can be channeled, deflected, blocked.
These beads keep me safe.
They prevent any and all spirits from infecting my head.
I could purify some for you, adjust them to your condition, of course.
Yeah, all right, let's do it.
But to sever the spirit's link, you're gonna have to bury the beads at the root of this creature's power.
Well, how do I do that?
Is there any place that it has manifested itself before?
Vincent mentioned an abandoned house.
This thing lured kids there, attacked them, attacked Vincent.
SOFYA:

- then let's end this.

I'll get started.
I can't let you come with me.
I got to do this alone.
I don't take orders from you.
Please stay here.
So I know you're safe.
[sighs]
KLAUS:

New Orleans native, I take it?
I wonder, were you buried somewhere in the vicinity?
Perhaps someone disturbed your tomb.
Is that why you're such an angry ghost?
You don't intend to kill Marcel, do you?
Your father was right.
You are a coward.
Because of you, he's lost everyone he loved.
And now, due to your pathetic fear of Marcel, you will suffer the same fate.
More meaningless threats.
Is that the extent of your power?
I remain underwhelmed.
You think I'm powerless?
[screams]
I can make you see and feel whatever I like.
Do your worst.
I know the truth.
The white oak is gone, Mikael is dead, and you are nothing more than a bad dream.
Well, then maybe I'll find my way into your daughter's dreams.
What fun it will be to be in her head.
Ruthless.

[neck cracks] [choking, gagging] [blood spilling]
[panting]
Imagine if I made you kill someone you cared about.
Maybe I already have.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Freya...
Next time, it might even be Hope.
No!
Even if you could resist, who will stop Marcel?
After all, I'm having my fun with him.
And I will make him tear through your family like you have these people.
Now, you only have the one choice, boy.
Kill Marcel... or he will kill you and everyone you love.

This journal belonged to Mary's husband.
He filled it in the months before he died.
Most of it's revolutionist garbage...
Plots for an uprising...
But there's stuff about my parents in there.
What does he say about them?
Ramblings about how they were traitors for dealing with vampires.
You can see his writing deteriorate as his thoughts.
In the end, he can't even form a coherent sentence.
Elijah, I think the Hollow made Mary's husband kill my parents.
[sniffles, exhales]
FREYA:

Freya, stay back.
What's wrong?
I don't want to hurt you.
But I can't trust myself.
[scoffs] I trust you...
I said stay back!
I've underestimated our foe.
The Hollow is more powerful than I thought.
It made me see things and do things.
[shouts]
I can feel it in my head.
Then let me purify you.
Okay?

Reinigen monde tavo veneno.
Reinigen monde tavo ven...
It's burrowed too deep.
But I know what it wants.
For me to kill Marcel.
Or for him to kill me.
Klaus, if this thing is demanding a blood sacrifice, if it's you or Marcel... don't let it be you.
Hunt down Marcel and end this.
Don't follow me.
KEELIN:

Just, every day you do a spell, vanquish some evil, do another spell, rinse and repeat.
I have hobbies.
For instance, I collect the ashes of my enemies.
My point is that even during my most traumatic hospital rotations, I'd make time.
Ten minutes, one minute, whatever I could steal, to go up to the roof, look up at the sky, and just breathe.
Remind myself that there was a whole world away from the madness of the E.R.
[sighs] I'll-I'll care a lot more about that world once I know my brother's safe.

It wants Klaus and Marcel to kill each other.
And when they die, it will absorb their power, and then... we'll never be able to stop it.
Hello, Marcel.
[door creaks, slams loudly]
Seems neither of us is to leave until one of us dies.
I know you're seeing things, Klaus.
But I have a way to fix that for both of us.
And I'm to take your word for it, am I?
Oh, don't be stupid.

Oh, but I can.
You see, courtesy of my dear sister.
Now you're not so unkillable after all.
You can't just take off.
That thing is forcing my brother into a sacrificial bloodbath.
Freya, you're bleeding.
- Oh...

It'll have to wait.

At least let me go with you.
I am not useless in a fight.
- I can control my form.

I can take care of myself, okay?
Trust me.
[birds chirping]
Growing up, I never belonged anywhere.
Not in school.
Not in foster care.
I always thought if I could find my parents,
I'd finally belong somewhere.
You do belong somewhere.
I did terrible things to find my family, Elijah.
And when I did, they were already dead.
And now I find out that the same people who killed them are... the ones who hurt Hope.
Listen to me.
I will not let anything happen to you.
Do you understand?
[phone vibrating]
[beep]
- What is it?

Of course.

Well, I wouldn't need it if I knew you could be trusted!
Well, trust me now and we both ott to live!
How can you trust yourself?
Spelled beads keep me safe from this damn thing.
I bury these here and we're done, all right?
No need to fight.

Then he will wrench the dagger out of your hand.

Do it now, or forever be a servant to the Mikaelsons.

And neither are you.

Someone will.
Kill your son, Klaus.
Otherwise, I will find a way to control him, and Hope will never be safe.

Leave my family alone!

[squealing pulses] [squealing stops]
I prefer my mind remain unaltered for the time being.
Weird.
I feel the exact opposite.
FREYA:

My spells have Marcel bound and cloaked.
Even more, I can find no trace of the Hollow's magic in either of you.
- So where has it gone?

It could be anywhere, and since we know that it still wants to sacrifice someone powerful, we have to be prepared.
I think I'll hold on to it for now.
This wasn't a gift.
Today proved Marcel's a threat, whether used as a sacrifice or possessed.
Regardless...
What good is having a weapon if you won't use it?
Niklaus, give it to her.
Having a monopoly of power makes you a target, sister.
Remember that.
[grasps dagger]
You think I spared Marcel out of some mawkish sentimentality.
The Hollow wanted both of us dead.
Killing him would have given it what it wanted.
Mercy was necessary.

[crickets chirping]
Don't do that.
Do what?
Blame yourself.
You think that if you'd stopped your husband, I... would have had a better life.
No one deserves what you've been through.
It's because of what I've been through that I have her.
She is a Mikaelson and I am a Marshall, but... we're both still Labonairs.
Mary, Jackson said that tragedy always followed my family around...
Executions, people dying in floods, fires, or just vanishing.
What if the Hollow is behind those deaths, too?
And if it went after the Labonairs before... what if it wan w to finish what it started.
