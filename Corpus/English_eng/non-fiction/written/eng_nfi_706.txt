It's my responsibility.
No.

But it's a match for Bill Martin's blood type.
Do you think that's the murder weapon?
It could be.
Why would this woman want to frame Isabella?
Shall we have dinner?
There's one or two errands I need to run though.
- Winter.

I know you're here!
Come on Harry.

- NO!

Don't scream...

Just give me what you've got and I leave you alive.
I've got nothing.
What's this?

Leave me alone.
Hand it over... now.
Do you want it?
It's yours.
- Harry!

Can you hear me, Harry?
- Harry!

Harry, stay with us, alright?
It's alright.

Harry.
Hey, it's me.
Erm, you're thirty minutes late I just hope you're alright?
- Hi.

I'm sorry.
I thought maybe something might've happened.
No, it's the Dalston Soup Kitchen.
It's a... a madhouse.
It's fine.

Hum!

I just wanted to say sorry for what happened.
I could tell...
You know, I should never have allowed your arrest.
It's alright.
You mean a lot to me and err, I just hope you can forgive me.
It's work, I'm sorry.
Yeah.
God...

Alright!

It's one of my officers, Harry Clayton.

- I'm sorry I gotta go.

No Jay, Jay, Jay...

Ready?
Nathan, it's not moving!
I'm trying!
SHIT!

And I've gotta get publicly beaten wearing... jewellery!
- Well, I'll fight instead.

C'mon, I go in, I take a few punches, we get the money,
- pay the debt.

Jay, you nearly died last time.
And you think I'm gonna let my little brother risk it?
We both know mum would've beaten me to a pulp for not looking after you.
Alright?
Besides, who knows?

What, like, you might go down in the second round, instead of the first!
Think he's waking up.

Harry, can you hear me?
If this is heaven, it's not what it's cracked up to be!
It's okay everyone, he's still an arse.
I thought you were dead, you scumbag.
- Sorry to disappoint you.

Daisy...
Dad, I was so worried about you!
Hello.
Daise, shall we go get something to eat?
Get you something too if you like.
Great, the third date vending machine.
Err, I was so afraid the paramedics wouldn't get there in time.
You saved my life.
You need saving.
- It's gone!

Sorry...
No, don't worry, Alistair, come in.

I'll go and find Daisy.
God!

Alistair...

Isabella tried to kill me.
What are you talking about?
I know it's the last thing you want to believe.
But last night she came to shut me down for good.
If Anna hadn't been there, she'd've done the job.
Harry, Harry, you've been through an ordeal.

No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I'm crystal clear.
They've been others too.
The criminals on our list;

What the hell is wrong with you?
First you arrest my girlfriend with deficient evidence, and now this!
We were involved!
What are you saying?
Isabella and I knew each other long before you did.
When I broke it off, she turned psychotic.
That's why she's targeted you.
No, you, you're lying.
Look at me!

I maybe a lot of things, but I'm not that cruel and I am not insane.
So why else would I tell you this?
Please, Alistair, please...
Get yourself...

Listen Al, Alistair!

Shit.
You're... still here.
Yes, I thought I'd wait for you after that call.
Thought it might be a rough night for you.
Thanks.
Do you wanna talk about it?
Harry Clayton was electrocuted last night.
That is terrible..
What a terrible way to die.
How did that happen?
I mean, was it in the line of duty?

We're looking into it.
God.

You know, when you say 'weapon', people think of a knife or a gun.
But a glass shard can be just as lethal.
Why are you here?
I didn't want to kill Harry.
But he made it impossible for me not to.
Where's the other bracelet?
I destroyed it.
You're lying.
You're the one who told me to destroy yours if you died.
Why would you do that?
Because look what it's done to you!
You just murdered the best man I ever knew.
And you can kill me, Isabella, it won't change the fact you're alone now.

Leave town.

Harry...

You're dead.

She killed me.

Shouldn't you be in the hospital?
Probably.

Isabella came by;

She thinks you're dead...

No, but it's only a matter of time.
Where's the bracelet?
Eve, where's the bracelet?
I... did something stupid.
Come on, Jay...

You got this.
Finish him!
And tonight, our winner, Jay Tate!

But...

Investigating Harry's crash is purely a precautionary measure.
Just examine the site, liaise with the Serious Collision.
Investigation Squad, make sure we're not missing anything.
Okay, we'll visit the scene, go to the impound.
Thanks.
And Suri?

Let's give Harry his recovery time.
Sure.
Can you get me a printout of all the cases Harry Clayton investigated over the last three months.
Thanks.
According to the report, there was a leak in Harry's brake fluid reservoir.
In there, see that?
Time of the accident, this thing was pretty much empty.
Could that have caused the crash?
Hard to say.

What caused the leak?
It's natural abrasion, in older vehicles.
But the report says there's no way of telling how or when it happened.
But Harry just had that car serviced.
Wouldn't they have spotted it?
So that's it, it's all paid off?
Yeah.
Anything we make from here on out goes straight to the bank of Jay.
Lucky for you, the bank covers its brother too.
Tate?

You was on form last night.
Been eating my greens, I guess.
I've got another club tonight.

You feel like stepping up?
- Yeah.

- Barman.

You celebrating?
Or mourning...
A little of both.
I just lost my only companion.
My last bit of hope in this world.
Well, you know the best way to get over someone?
Get under someone-else.

I'm having a very bad day.

- Sorry about that.

That was rude.
I thought I made myself very clear.
Yeah.

So why don't you lose the resting bitch face and make this fun for us.
Yeah.
Fine.
Argh!

Argh!

Help me, please, somebody help!
Dave, you got to come and see this kid, dodges like he's a mind reader.
You think our mugger's here?
Regular fighters are marked with a horseshoe tattoo on their thumb.
He had one.
Contestants get paid to enter cause they might not come out.
- Alright, Rory.

Can we watch?
Of course.

Keep an eye on him.
Tattoos.
You know the guy in the green shorts?
Yeah, Jay Tate.
Usually on his back in minutes, he's suddenly got cocky.
Look at him, thinks he's Tyson Fury.
Tonight's winner, Jay Tate!

Tate!

- Sir?

Crime scene was err, nasty, but as the report suggested.
Poor driving conditions, fallen pylon cable, Harry was just unlucky to be the path of least resistance.
Nothing to suggest foul play there.
- But?

Erm, a leak in the brake fluid container of Harry's car.
When he was out that night, he was essentially driving without brakes.
Do we know how it got there?
No.

Harry had the car serviced two months ago.
I checked the vehicle report, there was no leak then.
- Doesn't tell us much.

Being there at the scene, adding up all these weird factors...
Something just doesn't feel right.
Here are, just like I said.
And there's plenty more where that come from, alright?
Bit more than an entrance fee, ain't it?
- Tate.

Against all the odds?

Or is it something else?
Who are you?
DI Clayton.

You can feel it then.
Piss off, mate.
It's intoxicating, I get it.
Everything is going your way, feels invincible.
But there are consequences.
- What's he on about?

Listen to me.

Listen to me!
Let's go!

Stay down.

Five, five, five thous, five thousand.

Fuck!

We are gonna be rolling in it, bruv.
Seriously, I reckon I can beat anyone now.
Yeah.

I reckon he won't be able to catch us.
Oi, mate!
What're you doing?
He's a pretty boy, ain't he?
I'm talking about the car, not you.
Can I help you?
Yeah.

Jay, people can see!
I'm just talking nice to the fella.
You don't want to make trouble with me.
No.

Alright, I warned you...
Jay!

- Stop it!

Get off him!
- Jay, man!

What are you doing, man?
Jay.

Get in the car, Nathan.
Who the hell did you just mug?
Jesus!
You didn't have to do it, you didn't have to be there tonight.
There's nothing tying us together anymore, you can just walk away.
I know how much you hated wearing the bracelet.
Really?
You're a funny thing.
Eve, that guy is carrying a curse he doesn't even realise is on him.
However much of a dickhead Jay is, the bracelet's our responsibility.
Not yours, Harry.
I've worn it.

It'll always be my responsibility.
And you really don't know where he is?
Anna, I am doing everything in my power to keep him safe.
But you know what Harry's like.
Let's go back.
So the car swerved off the road, that's when Harry got out?
Yes.

Any other details?

Shouldn't you be asking Harry these questions?
Anna, if there's something you know, you have to tell me.
Harry said you were dating Isabella Augustine.
Why do you bring that up?
Because before I say anything, I need to know where she fits in to all of this.
With you.
Yes, we've been involved.
But...

There was a car tailing us that night.
Alright.

It was a black four by four.
Who was it, Anna?
Find out where Isabella was the night of the accident.
Be careful, Alistair.
Why didn't you tell me you knew Harry Clayton?
What do you mean?
Harry told me, just before the accident, said you knew each other from Gamblers' Anonymous.
Well, we're not supposed to disclose any information about other members, under any circumstances.
But there you go!
Well, I didn't even know you had a gambling problem.
I don't.

Honestly, Alistair, that is all in the past...
Harry and I barely spoke.

You could have said something that night.
Apart from the discretion code, it didn't really feel like the appropriate moment to talk about all this.
When you just had that call about the accident.
Okay.

Actually...

A man who lives opposite saw the whole thing.
Spotted a vehicle pulling away, soon after Harry was electrocuted.
Struck us as a bit odd.
You know, car crashed, Harry on the floor.
You'd have thought they'd have at least stopped.
Yes.

It's probably nothing, but we're gonna bring him in, interview him for a vehicle description.
Anyway, look, sorry.

It's good to see you.
- Coffee.

Woohoo...

You still weeping over your lost morals?
Right, so you're just gonna sit there resenting me.
Even though I'm the one paying for all this shit.
I'm the one with the plan, the cash, the talent...
I mean, what do you actually bring to the table, Nath?
Y'know, I used to think I was just looking out for you.
But you know what the term is for someone like you?

You know what?

What?
I don't need that rain cloud over your head pissing all over me.
Go on.

You know what, Jay, you always were a prick.
But you used to be a good brother.
Mum'll be turning in her grave right now!
Funny how luck changes someone, isn't it?
Right, give us some space, go on!

- Thank you!

- Your brother called me.

You're losing it, Jay!

So you enlist a flipping copper, you idiot?
I'm not here to arrest you.
I want you to stop using the bracelet, before it's too late.
You seriously still selling me that comic book shit?
Okay.
- Find the Queen of Hearts.

Just do it.

- No way...

It's obviously a trick deck.
- Name a card.

Pick one.
I told you.
It's the bracelet.
No.

- Jay...

Every since you started wearing it, how everything changed.
You're addicted already.
It's not the flipping bracelet, alright!

Jay.

This is all just some big fucking con!
I'm having my first good run in years, I'm not about to let
- some Celtic tosser ruin it!

- Jay.

- Jay!

Nathan!
Nathan.

Nathan!
What are you doing in here?
These are Harry's old files.
- This is private.

D'you think they have something to do with what happened to Harry?
I saw you talking to Anna Clayton earlier.
Please sir, if someone's trying to hurt Harry, you have to tell me about it.
I can't discuss this.
Not yet.
Where are you going?
Sir, what the hell is going on?
You watch your tone, Suri.

Look, I'm, I'm sorry.

Thank you.

What was that about?
I don't know.

- What are you doing?

What are we gonna do with him?
I'm working on it.

Can't become like Isabella.
How you holding up?
How the hell could he have had a brain aneurysm?
Nathan's twenty one.

I don't think it works like that.
So you're not messing with me, are you?
You really believe this is a lucky bracelet.
I know it sounds a complete bollocks.
But the sooner you start believing it, the more you'll be able to protect yourself.
So, so Nathan dying... that's really cos of me?
The luck has to balance itself out.
That's why we need to teach you all we can.
Before you lose anything else.
I've got nothing left to lose.
_
Excuse me.
Harry.
Suri?
That's right.

Suri.

We've been investigating what happened to you.
Winter sent us to the crime scene, and I saw him talking to Anna earlier.
I don't think he believes it was an accident and now he's left the office and won't say where he's going.
Listen to me.
Track his phone, send me his destination.
Harry's medicine's dealing with it.
This is mine.
When things started going right, I thought I was finally getting a silver lining for all the shit I'd gone through.
But this, this thing.
It ain't a reward, is it?
It's a punishment.
You put it on me.

I've tried...

Please.

I'm sorry, I can't, it won't come off.
What you talking about?
The bracelet stays with you till the day you die.
I'm sorry I can't change that.
I really hoped you wouldn't come.
There isn't a witness that lives opposite.
You tricked me.
I'm afraid I did.
It didn't occur to me at first.
The fact that Harry accused you of murder, and that very same night he wound up in a tragic accident.
I was vindicated of that charge.
Yeah.

But I've been in this job a long time.
You stop being able to ignore your gut.
And I just couldn't shake it off.
The way everything seemed to line up so neatly to make sure Harry died.
The leak.

And you know what the strangest thing was?
It extended to his cases too.
All of these criminals dying in the most mysterious circumstances.
- Bad luck.

C'mon...

- Please leave a message after the tone.

Suri, tell me?
I've got him, Seventeen West Walk, Latimore Road.
That's the road where I died.
Yeah, I know.

I think he's in serious trouble.

Where did you get that?
After I met you and Harry at the fight club,
I needed a quick getaway.
Like magic, this, this Porsche pulls up.
Found this in the glove compartment.
I thought I was on a fucking roll.
Everything I wanted just kept appearing.

Na, Nathan, he cottoned on to it.

Only, he's the one who got punished 'cause I wouldn't stop.
Jay...

You did this to me.

You knew what was gonna happen.
I know, I... made a mistake.
Will the bracelet bring Nathan back?
Will the bracelet bring Nathan back?
No!

Please, Jay, don't.

I'm sorry for what I did to you.
No!
Where were you the night of the accident?
I already told you.
Right.

You see, I called them, and they didn't have an event that night.
In fact, they have no record of any volunteer named Isabella Augustine.
And there was something else.
Anna Clayton saw a car following her.
All the way from their house, to the scene of the accident.
Harry was electrocuted by a pylon cable.
What do other cars have to do with that?
Maybe nothing.
But she remembers what the vehicle looked like and she could probably identify it if requested.
Was that your car, Isabella?
You'd never put someone away with that.
You're probably right.
I just wanted to know for myself, if you were involved.
And now I do.
When I met you,
I thought you must've been... sent.
I spent so long wishing for you.
And now I know who you are.
And I will see to it that you're brought to justice for what you've done.
If you confess now, your sentencing will be more lenient.
If not, rest assured we'll find the evidence to put you away for a long time.
Goodbye, Isabella.
Alistair.
It's such a shame, we could have parted so amicably.
So who's next?
If I kill her, I lose.
If you don't, we all lose.
I want SO19.

And I have to be there.
We have no chance of catching her unless I am there.
We have to get Daisy.

You have to suffer, Harry Clayton.
Lose everything, so you can see the world as she does.
If you had to put your last penny on one person...
Who would it be?
So how will you beat her?
You've no chance without this.
