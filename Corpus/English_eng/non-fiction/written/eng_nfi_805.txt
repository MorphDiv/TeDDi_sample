Ah, going away to college.
Back in the day, packing up your life for a fresh start was a sacred ritual for high-school seniors everywhere.
And no one was more excited to go away forever than my sister.
Okay, I'm all packed for college.
Now all I need is to befriend my R.A.
so that I can throw a kegger without consequences.
Well, you're three months early.
You haven't even graduated high school yet.
I may have jumped the gun a bit, but it's only because I'm counting down the hours until I get out of this hellhole.

Well, I still have three months left where you're my little baby schmoo that I want to gobble up because you're just so delicious!

- nyum, nyum, nyum, nyum!

Your mom-brain is fighting this.

There's nothing funny about losing a child...
- to college.

Our family is changing.
Everything that you've come to know over the past few years is about to be turned on its head.
Don't say that!
The Goldbergs will always stay the same!
Nothing will ever change in this house.
Nothing except Lainey leaving for fashion school and basically taking a dump on my dreams.
Okay, fine.

Erica and Lainey are going to college.

No more changes.
Hey, Ma, can you pick up some Bic razors?
Mine's a little dull from scraping the old scruff.
No!

I gotta.

- But I'm your old lady.

- but now it's getting weird.

Erica and Lainey are leaving.
My little baby boy has grown into a gangly, deep-voiced, furry young man.
But that's it... no more changes.
Look out, everybody.

Erica said that I can have her room now that she's gone, right?
- Oh, right.

I'm calling the shots now, Bev.
Screw it!

Nothing will ever be the same again in this house!
I'm home!

TV's mine!
Never change, you beautiful, miserable man!
It was May 17, 1980-something, and I was with my favorite girl, watching my favorite film franchise.
I don't want to overstate it, but "Police Academy 2:

is literally the most important movie of our time.
Sure, it's a critical darling, but if we're talking about laughs per minute, then you got to go with "Police Academy 3:

Point taken.

"Police Academy 4:

Obviously. "Police Academy 5:

comes out tomorrow, and we can't go in unprepared.
Oh, my God!

You just called me your girlfriend.
Oh, balls.

I mean, no.

I'll say it, too.
- Boyfriend.

- Boyfriend.

- Boyfriend.

- Boyfriend.

Damn it!

Look, we only have a few months left before I go to college!

But I want our Barry/Lainey Summer of Love Farewell Tour
- to be perfect!

I mean, come on.

So many fruits.

Hi.
This sounds like an intensely personal conversation, so you may want to take it far, far away from me and my girlfriend.
- Boyfriend.

- Boyfriend.

Unh!
Ughhhhh.
Look at us!
Look at us closely and know that one day you'll end up just like us, you ridiculous children.
This is getting weird and insulting.
All right.

That'll never be us, right?
Come on.

- Boyfriend.

- Boyfriend.

It was official.

Life was finally looking up until this happened.
- Oh, balls.

Yep.

Dana!

How are things going up in here?
I was gonna call.
- I'm back for the summer.

That's crazy!

Hot times!

Camp.
- I'm Jackie.

Sorry!

Dana, meet Jackie!

Not friends, just street ladies, ladies of the street.

Well, when you're free, we should get together
- and catch up.

♪ Mustard, pickles ♪
♪ Onions on a sesame-seed bun ♪
Welp, great seeing everybody.

Wait!

As I desperately escaped my worst nightmare, my mom was dreaming up ways to spend the summer with her baby.
Erica and Geoff.

- Damn it.

That thing only comes out when someone wants something dumb that only makes sense with a visual aid.
Hey, there's nothing dumb about my Cuddle Calendar.
Oh, God, it's got a catchy, but terrible name.

Geoff.

I can't!

According to my calculations, you have 63 days left before you leave this house and break my heart, litelly killing me dead, which is why I made this schedule...
To maximize mommy-daughter time.
Okay, according to this ridiculous calendar,
I'm spending every waking second with you.
- When do I hang out with Geoff?

Right there is a little sliver.
Well, maybe you don't see it, but it says "G.S."
- Oh, that's me.

- Check.

Let me draw you a chart of my own.
This circle represents how I'll be splitting up
- the rest of my time.

I'm just gonna miss you so much.
I need to spend as much time with you as I can.
Babe, as much as I love your circle of Geoff,
I couldn't enjoy it knowing it's killing your mom.
I'll be back for my sliver.

- be with her.

It's what I love about you, but it's very inconvenient right now!

This is exactly why I can't wait to leave this house and never come back.
Oh, poop.

- I'm sorry. "Plubbies"?

- Guard your belly button.

- Hey.

Look, I'm sorry.
Dana was my first real girlfriend, and seeing her took me by surprise.
That's all.

- It's okay.

Yeah.

Uh, where is he?
All I see is Ruben Amaro Jr.
- Casually displaying his athleticism.

Wait.

From seventh to ninth grade.

You spanned three grades with the guy who isn't afraid to change into his gym clothes without a towel around his waist?

Oh, so, you can be weird around Dana, but I can't be weird around my ex?
I'm not worried about you being weird.

- you two still having a spark.

It's Ruben Amaro Jr.
Even I feel a spark when he walks by.
Okay, is this what's going on with Dana?
Do you still have feelings for her?
Don't try to turn this around on me.
I'm still turning this around on you.
Okay, you're being insane, so have fun figuring things out with your ex and don't let me be a part of it.
Told you, bro.
- All love ends.

No, you won't.

- to remind me of her.

No!
Time was running out for Barry and Lainey, and the same was true for Geoff and Erica.
Just look at everyone, cleaning out lockers, signing yearbooks, saying goodbye.
Let's cherish these moments, people!
Cherish my butt!

Sorry.
That was uncalled for.

Why are you the one freaking out here?
- I'm graduating, not you.

Don't you realize this is the last time we'll ever walk down this hallway together?
Last time we'll ever reach your locker side-by-side?
Last time I'll ever watch your nose crinkle as you spin that lock?
Last time I overlook that you might be gross?
Okay, please stop narrating all my last things.
There is so much stuff in here.
What's with all these notes from your mom?
She put one in my lunch every day like a crazy lady,
- and I just chuck them in here.

"I love you more today than I ever have before.
- "I am here for you always."

"Dear Boopie, you're a perfect angel,
"and Drew Kremp doesn't deserve you.
"P.S. ...

Holy crap.

"Dear Squishy, I know change is hard, but I promise you,
"sweetie, your boobies will grow just like the rest of you."
Okay, maybe I shouldn't read all these.
Wow.

You okay?
I'm really not.
I just realized...
My mom is amazing.
I'm gonna miss her so damn much!
- What?

Maybe you should ask her.
Don't be mad.

I'm just subbing for Señora Gomez.
But I did make you these marshmallow fudge chubbies.
Adiós, mija.
- So good.

These are my last marshmallow fudge chubbies.
God, I hate her so much for making me love her like this!
The big day was here...
Gaduation.

Bev, stop with the crying.
I can't hear the children say stupid things.
But my baby is graduating from high school, a day I've been dreading since she graduated from my body.
She's gone forever!
Hoo-hoo!

I think both of your attitudes are very extreme and terrible.
And now the moment we've all been waiting for...
I'd like to invite our graduating seniors to get in line and receive their diploma.
I can't believe my baby's going off to college in just a few days.
You mean a few months.
Uh, sure.

Not on Tuesday morning
- before traffic gets bad.

I didn't borrow my cousin Greg's flatbed truck.
- So, yeah, months.

- You should talk to Lainey.

- I didn't mean now.

What is this about you leaving in a few days?

Mr. Goldberg, could you please not interrupt our joyous ceremony?

Oh, God.

- How does he know?

- He got it out of me!

If you're not graduating, take a seat!
Oh, crap!

- He's coming over.

I got a really deep emotional thing with my mommy going on.

Dude, how could you leave early and not tell me?
I'll explain everything when the time is right, which is not now!
No!

I'm not walking away.
I'm slowly and deliberately marching to receive my diploma.
Joyce Basilone.

Mr. Goldberg, you are not part of the processional.
Do not process!
This was supposed to be our Barry/Lainey Summer
- of Love Farewell Tour!

Lainey Lewis.
- Not the time, man!

- Maybe it's best I'm leaving early.

Thank you so much.

You're not the only one whose life is crumbling, you big butt!
And we'll just move right along to  Erica Goldberg.
My sister was steps away from starting her adult life, but as she stood speechless on that stage,
- nothing scared her more.

Erica, please let's just end this.
- Just take it.

- Take the diploma.

- You can't pass.

- Take it.

- No.

- You take this!

- Take this.

No fighting, just graduating!
Seriously, it's a great moment for you!
I will never graduate!

- Erica, please, just take it!

- Get away from me!

- Just take it!

Did Erica have her Bat Mitzvah yet?
- Come on!

- Just take it!

Oy.

Tell me about it.

Jackie date Ruben Amaro Jr.

Okay, yeah, I was insanely jealous of Jackie's jockey ex-boyfriend.
And so I made a date with my ex, Dana.
Like they say, old love dies hard.
Isn't this awesome?
Yeah.

You just checked your watch instead of laughing hysterically at how tall Bubba Smith is.

I don't get it.

Shouldn't they have graduated the Academy after the first one?
I think the problem is you're focusing on logic, not the lovable cast of characters.
Whoooooo!
Okay, in what world would an officer of the law stop a jewel thief by making weird mouth noises?
That's Michael Winslow.

They're LAPD.

In that moment, it was clear that our spark was gone forever.
Dana was my past love, but Jackie was the future and I had to get her back.
But first, I had to end it with Dana and break her poor heart.
Okay, what's going on?
Look, I've been wrestling with these emotions much like Hightower wrestled that alligator.
And just as Steve Guttenberg had to move on from the "Police Academy" franchise...
I, too, must move on.
Wait.
D-Do you think this was a date?
Uh-oh.
The way you say that makes me feel like...
Oh, balls.
... I misread this entire situation.
- Adam, I'm sorry if you thought that...

It was really great seeing you again, Dana.
I hope it's not the last time.
That day, I looked like an epic tool in front of Dana, but, even worse, I had lost Jackie.
As for my mom and Erica, they found out that avoiding graduation wasn't an option.
I can't believe I graduated.

- I let Principal Ball catch me.

- cheetah.

This isn't a diploma.
It's a note from that putz with the whistle!
"Insufficient credits.

What does that mean?

Mellor always said that if I skipped too much gym,
I wouldn't get my diploma.

You mean... you're not going to college?
- I'm not going to college!

My life has come to a grinding halt!
It's everything I've ever hoped for!
Wait a second!

- Yay!

What?

Believe me, I don't want to see her go, either, but she's leaving, end of story.
Murray, I can't handle losing her for the next four years.
I'd rather lose her for a few short years than hold her back forever.
My mom was about to do the hardest thing of her life...
Force the school to turn over Erica's diploma.
Coach Mellor, we meet again one last, final time.
I take it you read that little note I left for Erica.
All right, let's tango.
She's not coming.

But I kind of need her here.
I had a big, angry speech meant to guilt and shame her for missing my class 27 times this year.
This is an outrage.

Wow.

And she forged a doctor's note saying she couldn't run or jump because of "lady problems."
How dare you accuse her of forgery when you're...
"Dr. Edmund T. Doctorman."
- Oh, come on.

Fail gym, pay the price.
Okay, she's still a wonderful girl, and I will stop at nothing until you give me that diploma.
Ugh.

- That's it?

Ready to have your mind blown?
I have no real power.
My greatest weapon is threatening the kids with failing gym.
So, every year, I terrify the attractive, popular kids to let them know that their actions have consequences, even though they really, really don't.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you want me to call Erica and bring her in here?
Eh, the moment's gone.
You raised an amazing woman, Beverly Goldberg.
It's been a pleasure doing battle with you.
Pleasure's been mine.
Turns out my mom didn't need to fight after all.
As for Barry, he was just plain devastated after his graduation fight with Lainey.
Wow.
You're really clutching your Wrestling Buddy there.
You only do that when you're super sad.
Lainey's never gonna forgive me for spazzing up her graduation.
Her dad said she's not even coming to Erica's party.
Oh, God, I've never seen you this bad.
Well, I may not be able to fix things with Lainey, but I think I know a way to at least make you smile.
"Police Academy 5"?
"Assignment Miami Beach,"
guaranteed to wash away your heartache.

- Let's get out of here.

- What about you?

You've found your nerd-mate.
Now go.
Is this seat taken?
- Well, look who it is.

I'm stalking you, but this is a legit coincidence, which makes me think
I was a huge idiot, and I'm sorry.
What about Dana?
She was my first girlfriend, and she'll always be, but that doesn't mean she's the one.
Just sit your butt down already.
Boyfriend.
Girlfriend.
And so we decided to let go of our romantic pasts and just live in the moment.
As for my mom, she was ready to make sure
Erica didn't put her future on hold.
Hey, love bug.

Unpacking.
Listen  you know it's my dream for you to always be my little
- baby chicken.

But  as scary as it is, I think we both know it's time for you to go.
My diploma?

Actually, even he knows it's time for you to move on.
For the last four years, I've made fun of you for dreading this day.
And now it's here.
And I'm more scared than you ever were.
But you should know, no matter where you are or what you're doing
I will always fight for you in an embarrassing and inappropriate way.
You're gonna change the world, Erica Goldberg.
And you're gonna visit... a lot.
In the end, sometimes we need that little push to get us where we're meant to go.
And sometimes the journey is hard  and we struggle to accept the bumps along the way, but it's the people you love most  that can help you get through it.
- Sorry, I'm late.

I didn't think you'd ever talk to me again, you know, after ruining your graduation and embarrassing you in front of everyone you've ever known.
- Yeah, that was bad.

- It was basically the worst.

I don't blame you if you hate me forever.
Hate you?
After everything we've been through, all those memories, the best moments of my life?
I could never hate you.
We really had some good times, huh?
We had some great times.
And you know what?
This is the spot where we had our first real conversation.
Yep.
I threw that party, made an ass of myself  and you were the only one who was there for me.
God, so much has changed since then.
I mean, not everything.
Even back then, I knew I loved you.
And no matter where we go, we'll always have that.
You coming?
I'll be there in a sec.
How do you know so much stuff about me?
Your sister's my best friend.

Thanks.
Turns out Erica was right...
Our family would never be the same.
- To my peanut.

Not a person in that room knew what the future held, and, yeah, it was scary  but that's the thing about growing up.
You learn that the things that scare you most end up being the greatest memories.
And for me, the best had yet to come.
Sure, sometimes I forget details and always seem to get the dates wrong, but everything we knew was changing.
And those next few years of 1980-something, well, they'd become the stuff of legend.
_
Get ready to gobble-gobble, Goldbergs.
And your taste buds are about to explode.
Happy birthday, dear Murray and Bev
Ah, no!

You almost broke that light!
