I would really like you to go see a doctor to rule out anything structural or neurological.

I have been hit in the head a lot.
You mean CTE?

CTE, all of it.
Is that common among MMA fighters?
You know, it's common among fighters, period.

You know what the worst mistake in hu... in human history was?
[Glasses clinking, music playing]
You know what the worst mistake in human history was?
Anyone?
The worst mistake in human history was...
Agricultural revolution.
Once we learned how to plant crops, we effectively enslaved ourselves.
I'm hungry, I'm gonna grab a fig out of the tree.
A turnip out of the ground.
Now you just... it's all work.
I mean, that's all you do is work, you know?
You c... you c... you clear the fields, you till the soil, you plant the seed, you water it, you harvest it, you put it into a silo.
And even when you have enough, it's like all you want is more.
And this has made us violent, and... and bloodthirsty, 'cause we don't roam.
And we acquire possessions, and we shit out babies, and we get real territorial.
No, I'm not gonna walk away.
No, I'm gonna fight to the fucking death!
That's what we do now.
Because...
You know, because we don't roam anymore.
And we don't know there's a big fucking fig tree, a sweet, ripe, plump fig tree right over the hill.
We're all just... slaves to... [Money rustling]
Wheat, and corn, and potatoes, and famine, and bloodshed...
We're not what we were meant to be.
Agricultural revolution.
