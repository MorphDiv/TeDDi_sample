I mean, you didn't, so yay.
We need to talk about Al Parker's case against you.
He seems to be saying that the shooting was personally motivated.
The foetus' DNA wasn't matching China Girl's.
I mean, it can toast any thickness.
What about a mini pizza oven?
It's a really unusual gift.
Is she a party animal?
[PHONE VIBRATES]
Yes, Stally.
Really?
Hey, we thought you'd want to hear this.
He's talking about China Girl.
Says he's going to make a confession.
It's like you can't tickle yourself, can you?
You need someone else to do it or it doesn't work, someone outside your own nervous system.
OK, so I'm with this girl, she's gorgeous, and she's inspecting my dick, she's twirling it around, she's flicking it back and forth, and so I slip my hand up her leg, and, er, I get to her panties,
and, er, I slip a finger into her vagina and give a little schwizz.
[HE CLICKS HIS TONGUE]
That's disgusting, mate.
So, anyway, next thing I know, the mamasan and her gorilla come bursting in, and they're like,
"Get out my shop, you bloody fucking this!"
and, "You bloody fucking that!"
I didn't want any trouble, so I just got up and left.
Um, I waited outside in my car, and then the girl came out.
I went over to her and apologised.
OK, you didn't force or coerce her into the car?
At this stage, it was all very friendly.
So we go down to Bondi and pull in the car park and... and, um,
It's all going well, and she's lifting up her arse and letting me slip off her panties.
That's always a good sign, isn't it?
Now, I didn't have a condom on, so maybe that was the issue,
I don't know, but I promised not to come.
Anyway, I'm inside her.
Next thing I know, I feel this sharp prick on the back of my neck.
You can probably still see a bit of a nick.
So I grabbed her face and I held her away from me at arm's length.
You know, it's a small space in the back of a Corolla, so it was stuffy.
Um...
Yeah.
And next thing, she starts going very quiet.
And she doesn't.
She just... she just, er, gets whiter and, er... starts going blue around the lips.
So why didn't you call the police?
Oh, mate, I couldn't, I couldn't.
It was like the worst night of my life.
So I, um...
I tucked her up in this beautiful picnic blanket and, at about 3am,
I carried her out into the water, and I waded out past the first breakers there, and then I just let her... just let her drift off into the outflowing tide.
Yep, you just...
You just let her go, wrapped in a blanket that you happened
Yeah, she deserved it.
Can we chat in my office?
There are other things.
Is this your office?
What do you want, cocktail?
Probably wondering what my deal is.
I'm kind of between relationships at the moment.
Doing it pretty tough, to be honest.
I mean, you could be asking yourself what could I do for you?
Like what?
Seven or eight of the best nights of your life, complete discretion, total respect.
I understand that we're not relationship material, you and me.
But it's that difference that'd make it fun.
Look, you don't have to answer me now.
You can have a think about it.
You know, take your time.
Probably not.
[MOANING AND CRYING OUT]
[MAN AND WOMAN ARGUE]
[DOOR SLAMS]
A detective to attend the front counter, please.
The DNA tests on China Girl are back.
The foetus is not hers.
Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it?
She said you're checking to see if there's a match with the mother and father on our database.
When?
I was over there yesterday evening.
They just met and they seem to get on.
Adrian, what if China Girl's death is the result of a breakdown in the surrogacy arrangement?
Like?
Like she demanded more money or blackmailed the parents and there was a struggle.
Who's Liam?
Er, how do you know him?
He's her brother.
I don't know him.
She thought I was Liam at your place last night.
Hey, I think we should...
I think we should start with Sydney's IVF clinics.
We could identify the parents with a record of multiple attempts at pregnancy, people who are desperate to try anything.
Hey, Adrian, what is happening?
What is going on?
Why am I in an apartment opposite Hilmarson?
She's reporting to you, is she?
Let's take a walk.
OK, we've got to let you in on something.
We're on together.
[MIRANDA SIGHS]
What?
Well, I'm glad that's settled.
And congratulations.
Yeah, well, it's all about the baby.
It's a second chance.
I'm in love.
[THEY CHUCKLE]
Hang on.
Don't let me forget.
I've lined up my lawyer to talk to you if this whole Al Parker business gets out of control.
It's not a choice.
I've got an appointment at Assisted Fertility.
White bread?
Why do you want to go to Assisted Fertility?
It's an IVF clinic I saw on the internet with a surrogacy pathway.
We should go.
You think China Girl's a legal surrogate?
No, too young.
You have to have had a child of your own and be over 25.
I'm betting the baby's parents would have made multiple IVF attempts before they tried surrogacy.
They'd be known to the clinic as desperate.
And how did you and Adrian get together?
Well, I knew he was married, so I didn't think about him like that.
I just thought he was an excellent boss, a decent man, kind of straight.
I imagined he'd be really critical of me as a woman,
And then we were driving back from a seminar on DV from Gosford.
It started raining so heavily we were crawling along, and then the hailstones started and we had to pull over.
The funny thing was, we couldn't get out of the car.
The electrics had jammed the locks, and we rang for help but they said it'd be at least two hours, there was a lot of flooding.
And when I heard that, two hours, I started to really panic.
I felt something serious was going to happen.
And there was a bottle of red I'd slipped under the seat after a party, and I really needed to calm myself, so I opened it.
He wanted a swig, too.
We drank it together straight from the bottle and, even before we'd finished, we were kissing each other, completely out of control.
And the next day, after the pash in the car,
I went into the office, and I expected him to be really cool and withdrawn and act as if nothing had happened.
But he came straight up to me and he said,
"I want to sleep with you tonight, if that's what you want, because that is definitely what I want."
There was no subterfuge, no power play.
And that night, we went to a hotel and the sex was awkward.
There was a lot of fumbling, but it was beautiful.
We were awake all night, making love, trying to make it work.
Hello, I'm Dr Vincent.
I'll stay and chat with the receptionist.
OK.
So, a murdered surrogate?
That's disturbing, but I fail to see how our clinic can help you.
We're looking for couples who have tried and failed at IVF.
People who are neurotically fixated on having a child.
That sounds like everybody in here.
Ian has a dark sense of humour, but that's not at all the case.
We offer couples hope, and the satisfaction of knowing that their best fertility opportunities have been explored.
Now, they might still fail, but to be involved in a murder,
I can't imagine how that would come about.
[PHONE RINGS]
I'll leave you in Ian's capable hands.
Sorry, I have a procedure I have to take care of.
When I consult with people, I tell them the truth.
How old are you?
At 40, you might change your mind.
Your chances will be one in 20.
Pick a number.
Nine.
So you have a second cycle.
This is the ultimate casino.
The drive to reproduce is manic, it can become a vortex.
I had one patient who was desperate to risk her life just to carry a baby.
Did she succeed?
Three.
Yeah, she did.
And she died six months later, fulfilled.
Hmm.
Do you know any couple desperate enough to try illegal...?
Surrogacy?
Many, many couples.
But illegal surrogacy in Sydney would be dangerous.
Why?
You changed to three.
The law favours the surrogate.
If she changes her mind, she keeps it.
Because, I wish, but there are privacy laws, and I can't, at the moment, do anything.
Excuse me.
Well, who wasn't picking up the phone?
Oh, I think I said,
"Why don't you pick up the phone and..." Erm...
To write stuff down.
Pyke has a scheme to trap him, yet he won't tell me what it is.
He wants you to ask him what his star sign is.
No, not his star sign.
And then he wants me to ask which university he went to
OK, hang on.
Hang on, can we just get this scheme worked out, please?
I've spent hours working with a lawyer in Germany.
Now, we only need his birthday, and if we can get that in a pleasant, non-confronting way...
Then what?
If it checks out, I'm going to expose him.
If he's lying, she needs to know it.
Oh, here he is.
Isadore, just answer my questions about your birthday as if we're playing a game, OK?
OK.
Now he doesn't like chandeliers.
Julia...
This is Isadore, a friend of Julia's.
Yes.
I was just regarding the chandelier.
Originally crafted by artisan glass blowers of Venice, from the little island of Murano.
But this one is made in Pakistan with child labour.
Elegance, but at what cost?
So...
You gather to confront me, the gang of three?
Oh, I hope it doesn't seem that way.
After all, we want this evening to embrace you into the family.
Family.
Nothing pierces an illegitimate boy's heart like the word family.
We were just finishing Isadore's numerology.
You know, it's a compatibility game?
Three eights, very nice.
You're even tempered and positive.
Oh, what else?
An enthusiast, which is a good balance with Julia.
We'll do yours and Mary's.
You want to have a peek?
No.
I don't.
Come on, tell him your birth year.
Tell him when you were born so we can work out your compatibility.
Perhaps you want to know that I can support your daughter.
No, I'm not interested.
There can't be an engagement.
And there can't be a wedding.
Just open it.
This is how I am welcomed into the family, huh?
The lying bigamist.
It disgusts me.
[WINE GLASS RINGS OUT]
There was a cripple at the university canteen in Leipzig by the name of Lydia.
And the honey-skinned girls, they called her Lame Lydz.
I was 22, and I was good looking.
One day when the taunting was bad, I was getting down on my knees, and in front of everybody, out of pity, and out of sarcasm, I proposed to her.
And my friends said, "Hey, that's not cool, man."
But then, one week later, when the thing was practically forgotten, the poor creature came up to me, said she had discussed it with her father, and she was accepting.
My head buzzed so intensely, I couldn't speak.
For the first time, I was doing something completely senseless that, if I went through with it, I would be lost.
For me, that was irresistible.
There you have my shitty little story.
Oh, what was her name?
Was it Lydia?
Has he gone?
Mary's going to think that it is nothing.
He's a bigamist, Julia.
I did not approve of this scheme.
Well, I think the story's best read as an allegory.
Well, he's using it like a fairy tale which to explain himself.
Yes.
OK, what's his message?
Oh, I love your dress.
It's beautiful, your dress, isn't it?
Hello, Mary.
Is he in the loo?
Actually, darling, he's gone.
Why, what happened?
Is he all right?
Um, shall we order first?
No.
Did you fight?
He told us a terrible story about a rescue, and ruin, and he's going to do that to you, baby, and he is dangerous.
I did some rudimentary background research, and discovered that he has previously been married.
Well, so are you.
All of you are married.
Alexander's actions and motives are a mystery to the likes of yourselves because he lives his life at risk, and he is kind to the actual poor, who you, Julia, and you, Pyke, have never met.
I feel blessed every day that he sees something to love in me.
[JULIA GROANS]
So shove your conventions and your respectability up your cunt, Julia, where nothing ever has lived.
Look at me.
I know you don't love me, but he does.
He does love me, and I love him.
We're lovers.
And if he rejects me know, I don't think I could live!
Keep out of my life and never speak to me again.
Pyke, are you listening?
Who are you calling now?
I'm not calling, I'm looking for a number.
Whose?
Well, how can she help?
She's a wasteland, you'll get nothing from her.
Well, Mary liked her.
They met?
You didn't tell me that.
So, they've met up?
There's a lure here.
She's yearning for that missing piece, but it's illusory.
Let's just get through that.
Ah, just come down.
Ah, there you are.
I was just out on a bit of a run, and I thought I'd drop in to see if you've done any more thinking about the offer.
You know, what's your deal, what's your story?
Yes, I've been... burnt.
Deep-fried.
What if I was to put it to you a different way and say, you pick the number of nights?
Stally, I...
I don't know that we're really suited.
We don't have an ID.
We've got something.
She's a surrogate.
[PHONE RINGS]
That's a weird one.
Hi, Pyke.
[DOOR ENTRY BUZZES]
Joy?
Will you let me in?
I'm worried.
Please?
He don't care, you know, if he's dead or alive.
Did he eat anything?
[PHONE RINGS]
What you doing?
Hey, do you want to meet up for a hot chocolate, a tea or a milkshake?
Did my parents ask you to call me?
They did, yes.
So, do you want to meet up?
You can eat it while it's hot.
No, I'd prefer to wait.
You're very polite.
No, I'm not.
Yeah.
Thank you for feeding me.
Sure.
Are these yours?
[TEXT ALERT]
I should go.
Are you done?
Alexander doesn't really check his phone.
He's from the pre-digital age, when you make arrangements before you leave and you have conversations face-to-face.
My parents are really freaked out about his age.
Did they tell you about that?
They think that he's just some kind of dirty old man, and he is not.
He is so much more interested in empowering women than he is in sex.
He's helped a lot of women who don't have anything.
That's good.
[TEXT ALERT]
How does he do that?
He's helped them with money...
- [TEXT ALERT] - and helping them understand how to make money for themselves.
I should go, in case he needs me.
[TEXT ALERT]
Is he OK?
He said to stay away.
[SHE SOBS]
It seems like you care a lot.
He's very kind to me.
He's my soulmate.
That's very special.
And that's quite hard because I can get really anxious.
Julia would give me back if she could.
Her little toy baby's grown into a fucking freak.
She wants me to take tranquilisers because she fucking does, but Puss thinks I'm going to grow out of it.
Does it bother you that Alexander's married?
It bothers me that you listen to Pyke and Julia's fucking paranoia.
He's not a fucking society monkey.
I thought we were actually going to have an honest relationship.
[SHE YELLS]
Yell, I used to yell.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Is everything all right?
Liam, this is my daughter, Mary...
And my colleague, Miranda.
Mary, this is your uncle.
Well, Mary, it's so nice to meet you... after so fricking long.
Are you OK?
We're thinking of going for a wander down the beach.
It's a bit late.
I'd like to go.
[THEY SHOUT AND LAUGH]
I'm not doing that with you.
Um, but also maybe a dental hygienist, cos they're always in demand.
Hey!
Oh, yeah, what for?
Negligent treatment of a juvenile's possessions.
Bullshit.
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Are you OK?
Is she all right?
[BABY CRIES]
[SHE MUTTERS]
[CRYING CONTINUES]
[SHE MOANS]
[CAR HORNS BLARE]
[POLICE SIREN WAILS]
Yeah, OK, we've got a lady on the roadway.
My baby's missing, please help me.
It hasn't been fed...
OK, where's your baby?
Robin, this is Paul Chen.
He's going to be our chief police counsellor.
With ex-superintendent Parker.
He's got a bit of a delicate question,
Did I have an intimate relationship with my superintendent?
Well, actually, that's about right.
Hello, Robin.
So, before I answer back in proceedings, I just need to know...
So, it's complete horseshit that you stayed over in the Lakeview master bedroom one night?
There was no intimacy.
He put Rohypnol in my wine.
I have no memory of the night.
Just waking up.
That's a worry.
If you were unconscious, he can invent anything.
I really don't want him to describe the sex.
It was really funny!
She's complaining about the baby, so we go and check.
Her husband says, "There is no baby."
We'll see you on Thursday.
Thanks, Robin.
Thank you.
What are they talking about?
Oh, the woman walking on the overpass.
Apparently she was really lucky not to get hit.
She wasn't pregnant.
She somehow walked out of a psych ward believing that she'd lost one.
What psych ward?
Hello, Felicity.
I'm Robin Griffin, Eastern Coast Police, following up.
Do you want to sit down?
I just want to know if you're OK.
I heard your baby was missing.
Do we need to find the baby?
Oh, I've already told them, there's no baby.
She and I are married, so I think I'd know.
Felicity?
Can you confirm what your husband's saying?
Yes.
It's gone.
Was there a miscarriage?
Felicity, can you listen?
You didn't have a miscarriage.
Correct?
[SHE PLAYS]
It's lost, and the baby's gone.
She won't return my phone calls and she won't return my texts.
You don't know if she can read English or Thai, Mike.
Don't worry, hun.
There's a thousand reasons someone might go off the grid.
Like what?
Exams.
Mike, do you want to tell me what's happening?
Who can't read English?
We have a guest mother.
I think I have the parents.
China Girl's foetus, the parents.
Oh, OK.
Mike's criminal record.
Attempting to attack his wife with a ski pole.
Another arrest for cocaine possession last year.
I'm going in.
What's this for?
I want a DNA sample, it's a mouth swab.
There's a kit here for your wife too.
No, I don't think so.
I may not have great news for you.
An Asian female, 19-weeks pregnant has been found dead.
19 weeks?
Your guest mother?
Mee Noi.
And when did you last see your surrogate?
Erm, at the ultrasound about five weeks ago.
Commercial surrogacy is illegal in Australia.
It carries a two-year sentence.
And we have a right to have a baby.
This is completely legal, it's an altruistic arrangement.
Something went wrong, didn't it?
The girl was murdered.
Look, I've got to get back to Flick.
I need a sample from Felicity too, don't make me ask her for it.
How long have you known your surrogate?
I'm not answering any more questions, it's a human right to have a baby.
Can Felicity look after a baby?
[SHE SOBS]
Can you leave?
[DOOR CLOSES]
She'll be OK, if she could just have a baby.
It will make her sane.
I tell you what, this is not good news.
She's sold her apartment, I've sold my car.
We've tried IVF more than 12 times.
She really doesn't need this.
[BEEPING]
Do the swab, Mike.
What the hell are you doing?
If his DNA, if his wife's DNA matches the foetus, then he's a murder suspect.
Mike, where did Felicity have her eggs harvested?
I'm not answering.
Hmm.
Where did you do it?
Do you want to call a lawyer?
Can't afford lawyers.
How much did the surrogate cost?
It wasn't about the money, she just wanted to help us,
Even though you don't know her surname?
Such a good friend, but you don't know if she can read?
Do you know how many miscarriages we've had?
Each a little life.
Jesus Christ, this is just going to have her spiralling.
[BEEPING]
That man is grieving.
A wife murderer also grieves.
Oh, come on, at bottom, all he wants is a baby, that's it.
You don't have children, maybe you'll never want them.
I have a daughter, who I think about every day of my life.
Every day.
Every fucking... day.
I never knew.
OK, mate, you can get off the road now, it's a bit dangerous.
Here, love, here, darling.
Thanks, love.
Darling, give him his dinosaurs.
That's it.
[DREAMY MUSIC]
You are a good boy, do you want your surprise now?
Yes!
Can you get the nuts out?
Daddy had to ask the air hostess for those.
OK, bye-bye, mate.
Don't eat them all at once.
Bye!
All right, I'll just see what's happening, eh?
I'll just get you to hold off for five minutes,
Robin's outside having a smoke, she shouldn't be long.
Thanks, love.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
I might just pop out to the restroom for a minute.
OK.
[DOOR SLAMS]
I'm glad I caught you.
I don't want to talk now.
Ah, no, no, this has got nothing to do with what's going to happen in there, that's all official, they'll work it out.
No, what I've got to say is, um... well, it's personal.
It's good to see you, Robin.
I'm sorry, Detective Sergeant...
So, what are you up to now, who are you chasing these days?
You know, the feelings I had for you were genuine.
They were pure.
I love you.
I don't want to hear this.
[HE GRUNTS SOFTLY]
Don't... touch me.
[HE SIGHS]
What a creature...
You're disgusting.
[HE GRUNTS]
[SHE CHOKES]
Yeah...
Oh, God, I want you, oh, yeah...
Yeah...
[BOTH GRUNT]
[ALARM BLARES]
Oh, where's that alarm?
Code 1, officer in trouble, room 406...
[ALARM RINGS]
Fire.
[SHE SCREAMS]
Come on!
[HE CHOKES]
[SHE SHRIEKS]
Open the door!
[SHRIEKING]
You're going to die, I'm going to fucking kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
OK, enough.
She's a fucking murderer!
