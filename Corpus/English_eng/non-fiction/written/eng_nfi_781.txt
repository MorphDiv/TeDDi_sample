On Saturday, over a quarter-million people are gonna stream through that building.
A veritable who's who of nobodies.
Richard, we've tried marketing at trade shows.
We suck at it.
No, I'm not talking about that.
Let me ask you this:
We need 120,000 phones, right?
What is the first thing people do when they get in there?
Log on to free Wi-Fi.
But Hooli makes you download the Hoolicon app in order to sign in.
So, what if we somehow hack our code onto the app?
Then we will have our 120,000 phones all in one day.
I mean, that's malware, Richard.
Well, as a product of forced adoption,
I can assure you there are consequences.
Even if we get our code into that app and onto all those phones, people are just gonna delete the app as soon as the conference is over.
People don't delete apps.
Vine, may she rest in peace.
We'd need a black hat ninja for this one.
I wonder where we can find someone like that.
No.
I was there for a while, and as I said before,
I have to go back there right after this for an extended period of time.
Anyway, how's all this stuff going?
You must be, like, dying of boredom.
I am, but the terms of my plea agreement forbid me to touch a computer or go online, so.
Let me run a hypothetical by you, just to, like, exercise your brain.
Like, for instance, if I had to hack the Hooli app servers, mess with an app, and push it out over a venue's free Wi-Fi... how would I do it?
It's a trick question, right?
Because you wouldn't hack the app server.
You'd just launch a man-in-the-middle attack with Pineapples.
I think if I can pull library duty, I'll be able to sneak on and track down whoever ratted me out.
I am going to destroy that motherfucker.
Not if I destroy him first.
(woman speaking on P.A.)
Not to me.
Look, we set up a bunch of these at Hoolicon.
We position ourselves between everyone's devices and the real Wi-Fi.
So, they log onto our boxes and our boxes log onto the real Wi-Fi?
And they'll never know the difference.
It'll never work.
You don't even know what we've been talking about.
I don't need to, Richard.
The truth is, we've tried and tried.
Every time we've gotten a whiff of success, a giant pelican by the name of Fate takes a four-and-a-half-pound shit right on top of us.
There are people who are destined for greatness and people who are not.
Richard, it seems you and I... are not.
And so, I've had enough.
I'm ending it all tonight.
which led me to my epiphany.
This epiphany.
That was addressed to me.
No, that was addressed to "Richard Hendricks and company."
Company, of which I am a part.
You're not seriously thinking of going to Tibet?
That's where you come in, my great friends.
I figured we might pass the hat?
Just give whatever you are comfortable with.
I'll pay for it, whatever it costs.
Well, it seems the smallest of us has the biggest heart.
Thank you, young Jinathon.
You fly one way.
Don't you need a visa to go to China?
He's very corrupt.
That sounded... ominous, but, gents, it's as I was saying:
Where there's a will, there's a way... just not for you guys.
♪ ♪
No, I will not help you on this mission.
No?
Richard, we always said we didn't want to end up like Hooli.
How are we like Hooli?
We are trying to give free Internet to the entire world.
If we have to bend a few rules here and there...
I mean, it's all for the greater good, is it not?
Gavin Belson started out with lofty goals too, but he just kept excusing immoral behavior just like this, until one day all that was left was a sad man with funny shoes... disgraced, friendless, and engorged with the blood of a youthful charlatan.
I am never going to be... any of that.
Richard, not that long ago, you agonized over using a stolen log-in to get into a bake-off with Endframe, a company that stole from us.
But now you're, what, shrugging off large-scale cybercrimes against innocent civilians?
I mean, Lincoln had to suspend habeas corpus to end the war,
Richard, it's not that easy.
There's always a next time and a next time and a next time.
I cannot knowingly contribute to your moral decay.
