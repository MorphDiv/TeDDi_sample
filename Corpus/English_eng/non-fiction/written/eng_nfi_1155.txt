WALTER:

Cabe, you need a place to crash for a couple weeks, right?
As of now, Happy's apartment has a vacancy.
He's been alone for 20 years.

Last night, we played cribbage until midnight.
This is my campaign manager, Allie Jones.
My name is Gabe, Cabe.

Why don't you ask her out?
She's at least ten years younger than me.
Everyone's at least ten years younger than you.
As gross as it sounds, she's warm for your form.
Walter, cut the crap.

I never liked you because you never made me feel welcome.
You will never be a real member of Scorpion.
Um...
Take the job your friend offered.
No, it's-it's in the Middle East.
This is not necessary.
Walter, you didn't drive me away.
I made this choice on my own.
Man, it is hotter than a jalapeno's armpit out there...
WALTER:

No way!

Nope.

I cultivated myself.
Violation.
You ever see the movie Gus about the field goal-kicking mule?
If the rules books don't explicitly forbid it, anything is legal.
Now, look at this.
Hoo!
Winner, winner, fermented fish dinner.
Mm-mm.
CABE:

Already have.

Turbine will have enough thrust to push the waters through the pipeline from Spokane to San Diego.
All this talk of pipes made us realize that by running chilled calcium chloride through copper tubing underneath a small pool of water, we could create a curling pond.
You guys are distracted too easily.
Hazard of busy minds.

WALTER:

Little device I whipped up.
Dial in a few bits of data, and...

(mechanical whirring)
No brooming necessary.
What are you so smug about?

Yup.

Phooey.

What happened to Winchell's?
Tim lived next to Winchell's.
Now Tim's on his way to the Middle East, so we're back to Dingo's.
How do you screw up a donut?
You know, Tim's departure doesn't only affect snacks.
I ran some numbers, and he was integral to 29% of our cases.
No small loss.
Not really.
Well, I'm not saying that for any personal reason.

Everyone on Scorpion is replaceable.
There are other top mathematicians, behaviorists, engineers.
We could find a younger and stronger federal agent.
A-And, truth be told, there are three people with higher IQs than mine-- four, including Ralph.
So, my point is that we are all substitutable parts of a machine.
(door opens)
Great pep talk, Coach.

PAIGE:

No problem, kiddo.
You okay?
Me?

(whispers):

(grunts)
TOBY:

All right...
Uh, so Tim got off all right?
Other than the flight delay, of course?
Yup.
Well, there are numerous factors that affect the accuracy of airline departures...
I'm sure there are, but we should really get the team going.

Of course.

Back to normal?

How exactly do you feel everything's "back to normal"?
Well, Scorpion is back to the original roster, and we have a-a case to handle, and Tim leaving, as he told me, was his decision.

My calculations were off, weren't they?
Just a bit.
But Tim told me he wanted to go.
Tim said what he had to say because of an uncomfortable situation you created.
You effectively forced him out.
So, with respect to things between you and me, things are definitely not back to normal.
(footsteps moving away)
Just got a call from my contractor.
My house is officially mold-free.
So you get your couch back, and I'm finally out of your hair.
Oh.
Okay.
We're still, uh, in the middle of that game of Stratego.
Yeah, I know.

Sure.
Great.
Um...
I, uh...
This belonged to my mother.
She wore it on her wedding day.
And there's that tradition: something old, new, borrowed, blue.
Thought, when you married the doc, that if you wanted, you could wear it.
It's okay if you don't want to.
I love it.
Thank you.
Just a little something for lettin' me shack up with ya.
Speaking of shacking up, isn't that the cutie that's hot for your booty?
Oh, man, I'm starting to sound like Toby.
(whispers):

Allie. (chuckling):

Good.

I-I'm so sorry to bother you at work...
Ah, it's-it's no bother.
I just wanted to drop off the guidelines for the upcoming debate between Mr. Patel and Sylvester.
You can review them.
Oh, that's not necessary.
If you say they're fair, they're fair.
Oh, okay.

I thought we'd have it at the Elk's lodge?
Oh, that one near the new Italian place?
Yeah, yeah!

In fact, I've been wanting to check it out.
I hear they have a fantastic vegetable lasagna.
Oh, I love Italian food.
With a last name like Gallo, how could I not?
(both chuckle)
Yeah...
Oh, okay.

Well, I'll see you soon.
Have a good time today.
"Have a good time today."
Good time at what?

I don't know.

She was begging you to take her to that Italian joint.
No.

PAIGE:

Cabe, she wanted you to ask her out.

(door opens)
♪ ♪
Look at all that hardware.
Sweet.
TOBY:

Government finally got one right.
Speaking of "cold travels,"
Paige didn't say a word the entire drive out here.
She's pissed.
Yes.

Can I please plug my fan into one of your dashboards?
I got an extension cord so I can share the breeze.
A fan?

It's 110 degrees out here.
When your sweat evaporates, it cools the skin by naturally taking the heat with it.
Yeah.

Okay.

We need to prime the pump and run the turbine.
I'll calculate the energy output.
I'll record solar panel function.
And as the federal agent assigned to oversee this federal job,
I will observe from this chair, with my eyes closed, while I enjoy iced coffee in the sunshine.
Paige?

Sure.
CABE:

Oh, you're not helping at all.
(whirring) Water pressure fluctuation's at less than five percent variable.
Copy that.
Coil resistance is stable.
Check.

Hmm.
Well, that's because the temperature's running hot.
Actually, very hot.
WALTER:

Copy that.
Hey, there's a bigger draw on that solar panel than expected.
It's 'cause the turbine's running hot.
HAPPY:

Turbine's hot.
So are you, by the way.
Love that rubber boot, mechanic outfit combo.
HAPPY:

Save it for the honeymoon.

Uh, there's your problem right there.
The rotor's coated in copper.
Government specs don't mention that.
Copper in this heat gets a lot hotter than an alloy.
It's warping the pins.
It's getting louder, too.
Okay, I'm gonna shut it down so Happy can check each piece, just to be safe.
Hey!
How am I supposed to get any sleep out there with all this high-pitch noise?
(explosion, clanging)
Oh, that sucker exploded.
Looks like a shard of copper snapped off in the velocity and friction.
We'll have to find it if we're gonna fix it.
SYLVESTER:

Guys?

Cabe?

SYLVESTER:

♪ ♪
♪ Scorpion 3x12 ♪ Wreck the Halls Original Air Date on January 2, 2017
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
No!

Tell 'em a small piece of shrapnel sliced his abdominal aorta and he's bleeding out!

Get here now!
SYLVESTER:

TOBY:

Cabe, listen to me.

I feel dizzy.
Cabe, I'm gonna have to slow your blood loss, so I got to do something that's a little personal and a lot of gross.
I'm gonna stick my fingers inside your wound to find the bleed, and then remove the shrapnel.
Oh, boy.

Oh!
(Cabe yells)
You're hurting him!

If I don't find the bleed, he's gonna die in seconds.
God!

Okay... and here is the culprit.
Oh, okay.
I got to find the cut.
Got to be in there somewhere.
Oh, I got it!

That's cut clean through.
Um...

Oh, man, this should work.
That's not sterile.
Sly, I'm wearing Cabe on my hand like a puppet.
Sterile was gone a long time ago.
(groaning)
I've almost got the clamp on, but that aorta is pumping strong and it's hard to control.
And I have... got it on.
Oh!
PAIGE:

He's stabilized, but that clip isn't gonna hold long.
When's the help get here?
Lancaster scrambled a chopper, but it's 250 miles away and they said it only goes
150 miles per hour.
90 minutes to get up here, 90 minutes to get back down there.
That's three hours before Cabe even sees an operating room!
His artery's still oozing.

(weakly):

Yes?
Help me.
Okay, okay, okay, okay, so let's break this down logically.
The blood is being forced out of the binder clip because the heart is pumping out blood from the cut artery,
(mumbling):

They taught us at Harvard that stopping the heart is actually bad for the patient.
Something about the brain needing oxygen.
What if the brain doesn't need any oxygen?
What if we bring his body temperature down so low that it slows his metabolism down so he's not using any oxygen?
Suspended animation?
That's a long shot.

We're in the middle of the desert.
How do we get the body temperature low when it's a million degrees out?
Guys, he's shaking.
He's in shock.

Sly's stupid fan!
What about it?

I can use the water tanker's intake manifold to create a super-cooling evaporation vacuum.
What the hell does that even mean?
It means we're gonna make him an ice bath.
It would have to go down to 58 degrees.
Can you get it that low?

Okay, so Happy freezes Cabe, which will stop his heart.
The next step is repairing his aorta.
I'm a shrink;

There's no way to keep Cabe's temperature down on the helicopter.
He'll have to be warmed up within the next 90 minutes.
And we can't warm him up if his aorta's still torn.
He'll just bleed out again.
Walt's right, it has to be repaired while he's still frozen.
Doc... you can do it.
You're damn right, I can.
You were in my corner when you taught me how to box.
I'm gonna be in your corner now.
Okay, first thing I'm gonna need is super glue to hold the artery together.
Gasoline and Styrofoam will get you a really strong adhesive.
Do you have Styrofoam?
No, but the polymer in Styrofoam is in polystyrene and I have that in the packing foam of my hand drill.
Next thing I'm gonna need is an elemental reducing agent, something like hydrogen sulfur gas.
For what?
Well, we can't just reheat Cabe like a frozen dinner.
Shock like that'll damage his heart so badly, it'll kill him.
The hydrogen sulfur will protect his major organs when awakening from a traumatic state.
This is a geologically active area; 20 miles away, there are sulfur hot springs that I saw when I was mapping out the route.
TOBY:

PAIGE:

But you need to stay strong, okay?
Okay.
TOBY:

When Cabe's heart stops, his blood is gonna clot.
When we rev him back up, if one of those clots hits his heart, it'll kill him.
Sly, you're gonna hate what I'm about to tell you, but you have to head back to that outcropping of rocks we passed half a mile back and catch a rattlesnake.
Venom is a natural anticoagulant.
For Cabe, I will catch one with my bare hands.
I got to borrow your pliers to pick up the snake.
On my truck.
Okay, we all know what we need to do.
Let's get it done.
♪ ♪
Hey, don't cut it too short,
I need about ten feet of hose.
Got it.
PAIGE:

TOBY:

Almost done, how much longer?
PAIGE:

(both grunting) Look out!
Lay him in carefully.
One wrong jostle and that clip pops off his aorta.
(Cabe grunts and pants)
TOBY:

Any minute now, Happy's gonna do her thing.
Just need to stay calm, keep your heart rate down, buddy.
Okay, I'm ready.
Put the nail can on his wound while I freeze the water.
How does this even work?
Truck's intake will pull in air through this hose.
That'll pull the air from the upside down bucket creating a vacuum that will pull vapor from the water beneath it, creating high-speed, powerful evaporation.
Which Sly said is the cooling process.
Exactly.
An engine as strong as the truck's will super-cool the water pretty fast.
Dramatically fast.
That's how we'll freeze him.
(breathing weakly)
Cabe, this is where the rubber meets the road.
When we start this process, your body temperature is gonna drop to unnatural levels.
Your heart'll stop.
Odds?
Five percent... tops.
I trust you kids.
Do it.
TOBY:

I got to get the thermometer.
Hey, roomie?
We still got to finish Stratego, right?
Cabe, I'm gonna do everything in my ability to bring you back.
If not... it's not your fault.
Cabe, you cannot leave me alone with these guys, okay?
It's been a pleasure working with you.
(thermometer beeping) All right, start it up.
(beeps twice)
Okay.
(engine starts)
Oh, it's working, it's getting colder by the second.
His temp's dropping.

TOBY:

Guys, making a Cabe-sicle is pointless if we can't safely reheat him.

Okay, all we need to get is the wet vac, wire, an oil funnel and that battery from Happy's truck. (beeps)
Sly, we're all doing our part over here!
How's the snake hunt going?
I found one.
I think he knows I'm after him.
(hissing) He's kind of under the ledge of a bridge.
HAPPY (over radio):

You've got an IQ over 180.
You can outsmart a snake.
Toby, how much colder does the water need to get?
I'm not sure how much the engine can handle in this heat.
He's at 90.
We got to drop another 32.

HAPPY:

I'm prepping 40cc's of ice water that's about 48 to 50 degrees.
I'm gonna shoot it right into your heart.
Last few beats of your pumper will spread it through your arteries, but once I do it, you're gonna lose consciousness.
All right, buddy, here we go.
(both grunt)
We won't let you down, Cabe.
(engine rumbles and hisses)
Not good.
What the hell?

Get the engine up and running!

Not warming up!
What do you think I'm about to do?
Happy, what happened to the engine?
Blew the hose.
I'm working on it.
Is Cabe frozen yet?
No, and without this engine running, he won't get there, he'll just bleed out!
I said I'm working on it!
I'm swapping in a hose from the backhoe.
Oh, damn it!

It's cracked from the sun.
I can't start the engine again.
What do you mean you can't get it running again, Happy?
You can fix anything!
Not without a hose, I can't!
Aah!

I have an idea.
I'm gonna make a hose.
You need to refill the radiator!
Get me a bucket of water!

Happy, what's your plan?
HAPPY:

Rubber boot plus zip ties equals rubber hose.
Nice.

Oh, ah, damn it.
Why did science have to make water so heavy?
How's that hose coming?
It's strong but I'm not sure if it's strong enough!
These boots were made for walking, not pumping.
Wow, a joke from Happy in a tense situation.
You must be really scared.
You're not?
I'm scared to death.

I'm done.
Me, too!
Happy's gonna give this a shot.
What if it doesn't work?
Cabe dies.
HAPPY:

Come on.

HAPPY:

That's my girl.
TOBY:

Happy's evaporation vacuum machine is sucking as much air as it sucked before, but in this case, sucking is a really good thing.
Sly, all this is for naught if you can't get that venom.
I have a plan.

I'm gonna use real jujitsu on you if you don't get that rattler!
I will.

Rattlesnakes don't hunt using vision.
They feel vibrations and sense heat.
So I am putting my cell phone on vibrate, and running multiple apps to heat it up, and putting it in my sock.
Remind me to never borrow your phone.
Then I am pulling a string from the sock so I can dangle this (phone buzzing) fake kangaroo rat in front of the snake.
I am ringing the dinner bell and counting on 150 million years of limited evolution to take over.
Here, snakey-snakey.
(phone buzzing)
Boss, even with that venom, if we don't get the hydrogen sulfide to protect Cabe's organs upon re-entry to the real world, we're still screwed.
PAIGE:

Three more miles.
TOBY:

Cabe's body temperature's falling fast.
We'll be ready.

It's chilly in here, huh?
Hmm.
Strange, given how hot it is outside.
Guess the A/C really cranks.
If only Cabe's makeshift pool had such an effective refrigerant.
All right, so I know you're upset about Tim...
Walter, the only thing I'm thinking about right now is Cabe and how serious this is.
Understood.

I'm sorry, did you mean something by that?
We all had a chance to say good-bye to Cabe in case we never see him again.
A moment to tell him what he means to us.
You told him it's been a pleasure working with him.
Any idea how messed up that is?
We were pressed for time.

I've been working so hard with you for 2½ years now.
I thought you'd been making progress, but for every step forward you take a hundred steps back.
Well, it has been a pleasure working with him.
And that's the last thing you wanted to say to him?
Toby has a shot at saving a man who is bleeding to death in the middle of the desert, but I don't know if there's a cure for what you have.
For all I know, you're suffering an immense inner turmoil over Cabe potentially dying, or you truly feel nothing.
I-I want to help you, Walter, but I don't know if you can be helped.
And that... makes me so... sad.
Uh, there's a turn right past those rocks.
The hot springs is just around the bend.
(engine idling)
Doc, time check.
This thing is gonna overheat any second.
Just a few more seconds, 'cause this tub's gonna do the opposite.
(ice cracking)
It's freezing!
Sweet.

58 degrees!

I was gonna say Ice-Ice Cabe-y, but "Cabe-sicle" just came to me.
And you kiss me with that mouth?

Not if you don't shut up!
TOBY:

Looks nice and gluey.
All right, it should hold.
All right, let's do a dry run on this wet, fake aorta.
I'll push the edges together, you spread a nice, thin layer over the cut line.
I'm familiar with how glue works.
It should dry fast.

Check that out, it's holding.
That'll survive any chopper flight.
Okay, so much for the test run.
You ready for the main event?
Don't mind me.
I'm just a fat kangaroo rat who's lost in the desert.
(phone buzzing)
Sure hope a big ol' snake doesn't come up and eat me for lunch.
Seriously?
I'm full of iron and proteins.

(buzzing) Num-num.
This is ridiculous.
You should be jumping at the chance to gobble up this little fella.
The only reason you wouldn't feed would be because you're pregnant.
But in that case, there should be a daddy snake down here with you.
(rattling)
Oh... it seems daddy snake is up here with me.
This is a problem.
(rattling)
Got it.
Drop your comms out for now.
We don't need the others listening in to what's about to go down, in case it doesn't work.
Hey, Cabe, we're gonna patch you up, warm you up, and you're gonna wake up, deal?
He doesn't feel like talking.
Well, he does seem a little blue.

I'm nervous.

Uh, and...
Uh, there she is.
One binder clip coming up.
Ah.

Okay, time to put those sticky fingers to work.
What?

I need both hands to pinch the artery tight.
You apply the glue.
You know how I am about blood.
I do.

All right.

Now, slide 'em in right over my fingers.
Slide 'em down and find the artery.
There it is.
You got it.
It's just like putting your hand inside of a pumpkin, but instead of a pumpkin, your hand's inside
Cabe's body cavity.

Slide your fingers down a half inch.
Okay, you're right on the cut.
Spread the glue all over.
Don't be stingy.
It feels like cold spaghetti.
Good news, you're done.
Remove your paw from the federal agent.
Okay.
Whoa.

Hey.
Huh?
I'm really proud of you.
I just hope the others are getting what we need.
Oh, boy, this is an issue.
PAIGE:

GUARD:

If we don't get what we need and get back to our team soon, then a man could die.
Look, I've heard every story in the book from perverts that wanna get all sneaky-peaky without undressing themselves.
But you're not naked.
I just work here.
Drop trou, don't come in, I don't care.
Uh...
What are you doing?

Nude up, genius-boy.
70 degrees.

This isn't good.

Why don't I just start the truck and re-freeze him, then?
But there's nothing on the chopper to keep him frozen.
He has to be alive, with his heart beating, when that chopper takes off.
So we have to start warming him up, but even a small blood clot's gonna kill him.
Where the hell is Sly with that snake?
(yelling)
Take it away from me.
Ooh, ooh, take it far away from me, please.
Take it away!

I gotta be honest, I didn't think you'd catch one of these critters.
That thing is untrustworthy.
He snuck up on me.
You're a rattlesnake.

All right, Doc, how are you extracting the venom?
We're not.

You're gonna let him bite Cabe?
No, they're gonna kiss.

He bites Cabe, the venom goes in, and Gallo doesn't die from blood clots.
How about dying from a snake bite?
No, big guys can handle big doses.
Besides, a chopper from a desert hospital will have antivenin.

Because it's kinda messed up to force a snake to bite your friend!
Would you let me ease into this, please?
(exhales)
Okay.
Come on, you diamondback bastard.
(hissing)
Come on, I'm serving him up on a platter.
Oh!

Uh, uh...
Your assistance is greatly appreciated.
(rattling)
Walt, Cabe's got a shot of vitamin rattlesnake.
Where are you with the hydrogen sulfide gas?
Collecting it now.
WALTER:

I am going to pass a small electrical current from my electrode down the wire to your electrode.
This will split the water into oxygen and hydrogen, which will combine with the sulfur in the water to make hydrogen sulfide bubbles.
Just hurry.

Okay.
Starting the current.
(bubbling loudly)
You may notice a mild tingling sensation.
That's just the weak electrical current stimulating nerve endings.
Great.

(vacuum sucking loudly)
Oh, it... stinks like rotten eggs.
Oh, yeah, that's the hydrogen sulfide.
It means the electrolysis is working.
Oh...
You can really feel the tingling, can't you?
Just stop talking.
Understood.
Mesquite will strengthen the flame.
And give Cabe a nice, smoky flavor.
It's warm.

Couldn't let him get to 78 degrees without the venom, and now we can't let him get to 98 without those hot spring fumes.
Walt, Paige, ETA.
A minute away, and I've got a tank full of stinky gas.
I hope she's talking about the Shop-Vac.
No, the hydrogen sulfide collection went off without a stitch.
Uh, I mean hitch.
It went off without a hitch.
No problem whatsoever.
TOBY:

Let's put out the flames and let the steaming water gently warm him until he reaches 98.
Then, the normal autorhythmicity of his heart will kick in.
It'll beat on its own, and he'll be okay.
Not if Walt and Paige don't get here.
(car engine rumbling) Look.
Help me with the Shop-Vac!
Coming!
He's zooming past 94.
Get that hydrogen sulfide over here!
WALTER:

Okay.
TOBY:

I'll pinch his nose.
You create a seal around his mouth.
SYLVESTER:

Happy, pass that gas.
Valve is wide open.
Oh, that's strong.
Oh, I can't believe Cabe has to ingest this stuff.
Up to 96 degrees.
Perfectly on target.

Incredible, we fixed his aorta, thinned his blood, gassed up his lungs.
This is really gonna work, isn't it?
I can't believe we did it.

WALTER:

Guys, Toby, Cabe's temperature is up to 99 degrees.
That can't be right.
At this temp, his heart should've restarted by now.
No, the thermometer says 99 degrees.
TOBY:

We got to get him out of here before he gets too hot, or his heart will never restart.
Why isn't this working?
(all grunting)
Cabe, wake up.

You're gonna leave me after we've become friends?
Still nothing!
I swear to God, if you die,
I will not wear that pin just to piss you off.
TOBY:

He's not responding.

Get out of the way!
Come on, Cabe.

Come on.

Come on, Cabe.

Let's go.

Come on, Cabe!
Come on, Cabe!
Manual CPR won't do it.
Our only chance of getting Cabe's heart beating again is the application of an electrical current.
How?

No, but we do have electricity.

Lean him against the metal rim of the tub.

(all grunting)
Careful, he'll drown!
No, he won't.

He's dead.
SYLVESTER:

She's gonna throw the toaster in the bathtub with Cabe.
Okay, everyone back away from the toolbox!
Please let this work.

Cabe?

Still nothing.
Please don't let this happen.

Just when I'm sure you're an android, you're not.
I know you get frustrated when I take steps backward, but I don't mean to do it;

There are parts of my brain that work so much worse than others.
I know.
You're still mad with me about Tim, aren't you?
I am.
I have every right to be, but right now it's not about you or me or Tim.
It's about...

Agreed.
You can talk to the doctor later.
Let's try to keep Cabe company.
You know, I was thinking, after all I've been through, that maybe I should ask that Allie girl out to that Italian place.
Superlative idea.
There you go.

I'm fine with it, but I'm reserving final approval until I determine whether she's good enough for you.
Maybe I'll wear one of those Hawaiian shirts on our date.
Bad idea.
We're in these nightmares because our clothes are wet and sunbaked at the same time.
Oh, yeah, speaking of which, why did you guys come back from the hot springs in pristine condition?
Huh?

Clothes are dry.
And you have to get into the water in order to use the electrodes.
Well, the low humidity of desert air dries fabric incredibly quickly.
HAPPY:

Where are they?
Holy skinny-dips!
You went to a nudist spring!
You two saw each other's parts.
We did what we had to do to save Cabe.
Uh... it was very...

And naked.

You could've burned your schmeckle.
Now I wish I got hit with the shrapnel.
Okay, well, uh, I'm gonna go to Kovelsky's.
Get some food.

Cantaloupes and wieners?
I will kill you.
Tater Tots and salami?
Ooh.
It's very amusing.
I had to die for an hour to finally get some peace and quiet from you guys.
