Williamsburg Savings Bank
good morning sir, Welcome to Williamsburg Savings Bank.
Let me give you a call,
We will arrange an interview for you With a bank employee.
Once someone is available.
What will this device do?
It will shine and shake.
The red lights will turn in a circle.

Where do I wait?
In the guest lounge.
Williamsburg Savings Bank.
We are ready to meet you now.
I see overdrafts On your current account.
It seems that no deposits have been made.
A few months ago.
"Waxler" for mining.
Yes, I have been phoning them for weeks.
I did not get a satisfactory answer.
What about this foreclosure warning?
Yellow warning.

My real estate mortgage tripled.

I got a short promotion With a reduced interest rate ended in January.
That's why they call it "short."
Right?

The new interest rate is much higher,
So monthly payments jumped To suddenly mortgage you.
We must clarify the possibility of this happening When refinancing.
- You did it.

You sold me this nonsense.
"Joe Harding".
No.

To review my remarks here only.
Terms and conditions are explained.
I personally explained.
The possibility of higher interest rates During refinancing.
Do you remember that?
You told me.
The odds of exceeding the interest rate For the basic financing price.
Very slim.
But it is possible.
But you have confirmed that it is "very small".
- But I did not hide it "possible."

My granddaughter and daughter live with me.
My daughter is a nurse with low wages.
She wanted her daughter to go to a better school, So dwell with me.
- Many do.

I can not lose my house.
Do not worry.
It is only yellow warning.
The red alert is the most dangerous.
Can I talk to someone else?
- With whom?

Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for your attention.
We came for a withdrawal.
Excluding cashiers,
We would like to lie down on your back,
And lift up your arms and your feet In the air like cats.
Let everyone land!
Camera 5.
Dear tellers,
Please do not act foolishly They call the silent alarm.
Police men They are the last to attend.
The situation will be messy, right?
Raise your hands.
Why is that?

You!
I follow the rules, Follow the procedure only.
Just stay calm, stay calm.
- Follow the procedures.

You will be shot!
Dear Sir, It is worth your while to remain silent.
I suffer from muscle spasm.
Please relax, you can sit down.
No!

And keep putting money, come on.
You can take this.
I am sorry that you are the victim of a corrupt regime No longer serve people.
Yes, I was saving my money here 40 years ago.

They only care about your account number.
There is not much in it, but it's all yours.
No my friend, not you.
It is the duty of society to care for the elderly.
This "Chuck" never cared.
"Chuck".
- Are you "Chuck"?

I "Chuck", I "Chuck".
Are you the one who will take this man's house?
- No, not personally.

Well, I have...

I have many cards here, we agreed?

Membership is available in a gym.

15 seconds.
Cutting position!
Shut up!
I am happy to say that our meeting is over.
Please do not tell the police for ninety seconds.
The shooting does not end Never happy ending.
They make pills to solve it.
"Go style."
This tattoo looks like a ring to me.
The details are many.
I think the artist of all colors painted them.
If the shop found a snag,
You'll find the artist, You will find a bank thief.
It seems to me a simple matter.
True, I thank you very much, old man.
We'll get you a job in the police.
Listen, I watch a television series.
Called "Lo and Order" They solve crimes faster than you.
You should see it.
In the real world,
It takes longer to solve crimes From an hour-long series.
I think that's all, Mr. Harding.
If we protest any additional information, We'll call you.
I'll give you my address and phone number.
This is not necessary.
We will find you, this is our specialty.
So how did they look?
Their features are difficult to define.

I approached one of them, He was a 180 cm tall man.
He had a tattoo around his neck
I told you about it.
If they find the artist of shame.
- They will find the offender.

That's what I told them.
Well, I'm sure he is not supposed to Talk about these things.
You must be present during a burglary It was great.
Crime is not wonderful, my love.
He could have been shot.
Or worse.
What is worse than being shot?
Exposure to two rounds of fire.
These details traditionally indicate To belong to a criminal gang.
We believe these individuals have been used The artist himself.
If we find this artist, we will find the criminal.
Bank robbery in Brooklyn - Client "Heimer", FBI.
It's really simple.
- Hey, that's what we said.

What a creep.
Pay attention to your words.
If you have any information About the artist of shame.
Police draw for tattoo
I hit it!
"The three men left With about $ 1.6 million."
Three hooded robbers steal 1.6 million.
"FBI and police 'New York'."
"They say they have no evidence right now."
and what?
No one is hurt only the insurance company, They will be fine.
They were very quiet gentlemen.
They carried out the operation very carefully.
Like a dance.
Yes, the "Kunga" dance is immediately immersed in them In prison.
Will we play or what?
Ask the responsible man.
Milton?
Milton!
Who will play in the second arena?
Yeah.
"J52".
If my condition is as bad as it is, They fired at me.
Did you receive one of these messages?

She came in a registered mail.
Yes sir.
Have you ever received good news?

Have you contacted anyone in the factory?
Not yet, but we'll discover what's going on.
I need pension money.
Yes, we are all this man.
I have something very important to say.
"J52".
Let's go and help the old.
"Easy Rollers."
When we agreed to merge,
Simtek did not have the intention To close factories in "America".

I can not address you Unless you are calm.
Excuse me, Mr. Lewis.
Welcome Joe.
What does this mean?
What will happen to our pension?
"Simtech" for mining has been frozen.
All pension payments During the transitional period.
What does that mean?

Wixler kept a box.
To meet the retirement plans concluded Prior to merger,
Which would eventually unite With the new pension fund.
Under the new employment contract.
Heaven forbid, can you speak clearly?
With the cessation of US operations, There is no longer any financial responsibility for SIMTEC.
The retirement fund will be dissolved.
With all my respect, "Donald"
30 years of hard work Does not mean anything to you!
Restaurant "Nat".
Without retirement money, I will not even be able to pay this month's rent.

I am in need of your abuse.
The world hurts me enough.
Within 20 days, There will be no roof for me.
Social security check is worthless, And the pension went into the wind.
The three of us will carry out the process.
If you want 25 percent for our help, There is nothing wrong with it.
But if you do not want to.
Keep your hobbies to yourself!
It was a good speech, O owner.
Will it help us?
Do you have any snacks?
"Willie"?
I like the air blowing in my face.
And I too.
Oh my God!

I think I'll get a recipe for her.
And I too.

It's the same nonsense, but you're too.
Do you mind?
Take them both.
Well.
How much do you have to live, "Willie"?
I do not know.
He guessed.
