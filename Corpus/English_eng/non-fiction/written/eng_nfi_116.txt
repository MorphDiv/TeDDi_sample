- (atmospheric music) - (whooshing flourish)
- MERCADO:

- (drum beats flourish)

You stay the fuck away from me.
If anyone has an issue with the way I run things, now's your chance to spit it out.
- (cable ties zip)

- (inmates gasp)

(sighs)
(whooshing flourish)
(gasps) Oh, fuck!

Ferguson took out the trash when Kaz couldn't.
CHANG:

Top Dog!
Top Dog!

(fading out) Top Dog!
(footsteps echoing)
(theme music)
♪ You don't know me, when I don't know you ♪
♪ You don't know me, when I don't know you ♪
♪ You're calling me in.

♪ You're calling me in.

♪ You're calling me in.

♪ You don't know me, when I don't know you ♪
If this was an isolated incident I might be able to understand... but Smith has been murdered,
Stevens bashed so badly she can't walk, and now a prisoner has had their tongue cut out, right under our noses without anybody, not one of you, noticing anything.

Clearly the attack on Gambaro was Ferguson's handiwork
Now that she is Top Dog we have to be twice as vigilant.
This is just a taste of what she is capable of.
(tittering)
Oh, if only the Department found it so amusing.
One more serious incident, heads will roll.
And it won't be mine.
Get back to work, and take down the fucking decorations!
- Bring Ferguson to my office.

- (steam press whooshing) - (ominous music)
Well, I hope Kaz is fuckin' happy.
We warned her if she didn't bash Juice someone else would've.
- Yeah.

- Yeah.

- out of my head.

Can they sew a tongue back on, do you reckon?
Sh-sh-sh-sh, she's looking.
What's Tina's problem?
Nah, you'll need to be more specific.
She won't sell me any more gear.
Well, I told her not to.
Why?
You junkies have such a tenuous understanding of cause and affect.
I seem to recall that you attacked me with a billiard ball in a sock.
Does that ring a bell?
(steam press whooshing)
(trolley wheels rattling)
What was that about?
Nothing.
Didn't look like nuffin'.
Nothing for you to worry about.
(gentle music)
(steam press whooshes)
I reckon she's back on the drugs.
Oh, look we don't know that for sure, love.
She gave the Freak her dessert, that's fucked.
- DOREEN:

- LIZ:

- God, I dunno.

- What's going on?

- About...?

There you go.
What's up?
How are you going, love?

Yeah, good.

You're not your normal self, Allie.
What... what are you doin' back on the gear?
- Like after everything that Bea

- done for ya.

- bloody sledgehammer.

We're just trying to understand what's going on,
- that's all.

Just lookin' out for ya, love.
Bea would've hated seeing' you back on
- on the gear.

I fucking know better than any of you!
- We're not saying you don't know, Al.

I haven't forgotten her, okay.
I never will.
Thanks for the family ambush!
(door closes)
- Clearly she doesn't want our help.

LIZ:

DOREEN:

BOOMER:

- (music darkens) - (door beeps unlocked)
(faint echoed drum beat flourish)
- (faint whooshing flourish) - (door closes)
A tongue in a box.

Just stop your whining.

Let's just focus now on making you Governor.
Vera's job is hanging by a thread.
We only need to give things a little push.
Just keep your drugs coming thick and fast.
- It's only a matter of time.

(bongo drums added to music)
(music ends)
(knocking)
I've got Ferguson for you, Governor.
Don't sit.
That'll be all, Mr Stewart.
(door closes)
So, is this the meeting where we plan how we're gonna work together,
- for the benefit of the women?

This is the one where I suspend all your privileges.
On what grounds?
I know it was you.
- (inhales) - (ominous music)
What's the legal expression?
It's um, it's on the tip of my tongue.
- (clicks mouth) - (faint grating flourish)
Burden of proof?
Take it up with the Ombudsman.
If you try anything...
I will have you slotted... indefinitely.
You're on notice.

(door opens)
Get her out of here.
(music intensifies)
(door closes)
- (music ends) - (inhales shakily)
- (door beeps unlocked) - _
I'll take her back, Nurse.
Okay.

- Thank you.

- How's the arm?

(exhales deeply)
She is going to tear those women to shreds, piece by piece,
(hushed) and I feel sick about it.
Well, I did try to warn you.
She would have become Top Dog no matter what I did.
Then do something about it.
Like what?

Kaz...
- win them over.

Okay, sign up for peer worker.
Now, that's a start.
Put your principle into good use.
Not the worst idea I've ever heard.
Do you think you can help me get to the bottom of the drug supply?
(sighs)
How?
Well, Ferguson's propped up by the dealers... we get rid of the drugs, kills two birds.
There is an officer involved, I'm telling you.
- There is a fucking officer involved.

It'll be a contract in the laundry or the kitchen.
Okay, prove it.
(sighs quietly)
So, she was trolling' ya?
Yeah, definitely.

So what, then you found out where she lived and you bashed her?
She asked for it.

So, it's mitigating circumstances.
- FRANKY:

I'd like a word with Doyle, alone please.
Ms Bennett.
(door closes)
How's your case coming?
- It's not mine, it's Iman's.

Might be an argument for a reduced sentence.
VERA: (hushed) Okay.
I've always admired that about you... your willingness to help the other women, despite what's going on in your own life.
Well, that's me, patron saint of lost causes.
(inhales)
You know, there's a way you could really help them.
Take down Ferguson.
I'd rather keep my tongue,
- for obvious reasons.

Well, anyone with half a brain can see that, why haven't you shifted her off to the nuthouse yet?
Because the people with half a brain don't have the evidence to prove it.
So, you want me to fix your problem for you?
Ah, it's not just my problem.
She's making life hell for everyone, including your friends.
(moody music)
Nah, well you can tell Proctor.

You are the only one who can take on Ferguson.
The women will rally around you.
You're not draggin' me back in.
(whooshing flourish)
(music ends)
What do you want?
I need to see Ferguson.
Wouldn't advise it.
What is it?
Can you tell Tina it's okay, please?
I feel I'm having déjÃ  vu.
I've got cash, how much do you want?
Here, I've got it with me.

- How much?

(hushed) Oh, fuck!
What do you want?

You want me to beg in front of everyone?

- I'm begging you.

- Please, please, I need it.

- Please!

- Please, I need it!

You know, as entertaining as it might be to watch you grovel, the problem is one of supply and demand.
Product is scarce, prices skyrocketing.
Well, go to my cell then, take whatever you want.
You can have whatever you want.
I doubt that you would have anything of value to offer.
Get her out!
(Allie sighs) Okay, I'm going.
(rustling of money)
I might check it out.
- See what you got.

(urgent music with drum accents)
- One, two, three, four...

Oh, Allie.
You guys were right before about Bea.
Oh no, love, look I think we all got a little bit worked up.
- (Liz sighs) - (hushed) Here.
You should have this, not me.
I'm shit at being her widow.
(chuckles disbelievingly)
- Allie, this is... this is yours.

- (hushed) I didn't deserve her.

Lovey, that is not true.
Liz, please keep this safe.
No matter what.
Allie... (echoing drum beat)
(tense music)
(magpie cawing)
(wind whistling)
(music brightens with a drum beat)
- (magpie cawing and music ends)

- Hey there.

Jesus Christ, it's a bloody barrel of laughs
- out here, ain't it?

Look at that.
LIZ:

Doesn't look like they've got much choice to me.
Probably scared to death, like the rest of us.
Oh, well boo-fuckin'-hoo.
Nah, if Kaz had let me bash Lucy none of this would've happened, eh?
Ooh, now, Susan, violence isn't the answer to everything.
Yeah, that's what people who can't fight always say.
Always.
- SONIA:

- D.

Ferguson's got everyone walking' on eggshells.
- Can you do somethin' for me?

Were you thinkin' about it?
Nah, everyone else is.
You know we'd be right behind you if you did.
What'd you wanna ask me?
Can you have a chat to Allie?
About what?
We tried an intervention and it didn't go down very well.
Oh, well there's a surprise.
I'm worried about her.
I'm worried she's gonna OD or top herself or something.
What?
She gave me Bea's sketchbook.
- Yeah?

- she'd wanna give away.

She sounded like she was goin' away and not comin' back.
Oh shit, Liz, I'm not a grieve councillor.
I know, love, I know, but... just have a word to her and make sure she's not gonna do anything stupid.
Yeah, sure.
You know junkies, they'll tell you anything.
Yeah.

(jaunty music with drums)
(music ends)
Oi.
You got a minute?
Sure.
Liz is freakin' out.

(sighs) Oh, well she shouldn't be.
She reckons you're tryin' to score drugs off Ferguson.
(scoffs)
I'm not.
Where's the stash... hmm?
Is it here somewhere?
- Ah-huh.

- Look out.

(sighs)
Give it back.
You've got enough fuckin' shit here
- to kill a horse!

- Give it to me!

- No, please, please don't.

Please, you don't understand.

- Poor Red.

You don't know anything about us.

I know she didn't die so you could become a fuckin' junkie again!
(quietly tense music)
- GUARD:

- (hushed) Okay.

I'm clean.
- I have been since Bea.

(sighs)
I've been stockpiling.
I just need one more hit and I'm ready.
For what?

Ferguson.
I'm gonna hotshot the bitch.
Fuck no!
Don't go down the same rabbit hole as Red did.

I'm willing to take that risk.
What and you think Ferguson's just gonna stand there while you stick her with a needle?
I'll find a way.
Forget it!
Now, you flush it!
Ferguson is a fuckin' spider.
She's got eyes in the back of her head.
Now, you flush the shit or I will.
(hushed) Fine.
(door unlocking outside)
- (toilet flushing) - (music ends)
You were never gonna get that close
- to her.

(Franky sighs deeply)
(music restarts)
(echoing drum beat flourish)
(music fading)
- (echoing drum beat flourish) - (grating whooshing flourish)
What do you want?
I need more of everything.
Already?
What, you think I sit on my arse all day like all you bosses?
You'll have to wait.

Next week?

- You organise an extra delivery.

Or maybe I need a supplier with bigger balls.
Or maybe you need a week in the slot to chill out.
Let's make money... not war.

- (throbbing music)

Yeah, Turk, it's me.
I need another bin drop.

Cheers.
SONIA:

- in the prison system.

- to expand this project.

I have already lined up a very generous benefactor.
And why are they interested in funding such an enterprise?
Pure philanthropy, because this project has the potential to capture the hearts and minds of the women.

Is Ferguson behind this?
Certainly not, and I'm not seeking her approval.
Only yours.
(inhales deeply) Well, in principle I think it's an excellent idea, but I will need the approval of the Regional Manager if we want to expand it into a fully fledged industry.
- Can't wait to tell the other women.

MILES: (via walkie-talkie) Attention, officers.

- H Block exercise yard.

- (siren continues waling and chirping) - (fire roaring)
(fire extinguishers whooshing)
Organise some prisoners to clean this up.
(siren stops)
What'll they think of next?
(music fades)
This is not a random act of vandalism.
We couldn't identify them from the CCTV.
They had their hoodies pulled up and their faces covered.
What about if that's how they were getting the drugs in?
Sanitary Bins?
Well, I've checked all the other supplies, nothing jumped out.
What if they torched the bins so we'd have to order urgent replacements?
Yeah, I s'pose it's possible.
Let's test my theory.
(echoing drum beat flourish)
(whooshing flourish)
(hushed) Fuck!
(exhales)
(plastic rustling)
(urgent music)
(gasps quietly)
(laughing)

(cell door clanging open)
_
(lift dings)
Sierra 6 to Sierra 3, they're coming out of the lift now.
Copy that Sierra 6.
- _ - (urgent music continue)
We've spoken about it before, I don't want to talk about it.
So, that's...
Okay?
I gotta go.
(door closing)
(suspenseful tone and drum beat)
- (door opening)

- Okay, Mercado, that'll do!

- Back up, Mercado.

- (suspenseful tone continues)

On your rags, Mr Jackson?
- Where is it?

- you're talking about.

(drum beating flourish)
- This is gonna be awesome!

- Yeah, Dream Team.

- common.

But like all good partners, we compliment each other.
Yeah... yeah, like...

- Uh, I do.

Hey.

- Eh!

- You got the green light.

We just need the approval of the powers that be.
- Whoo!

Yeah, we're gonna take over the world.
And, as a matter of fact, we've got, uh, a proposition to make to you, Liz,
- haven't we?

We want you to come on-board as our Horticultural Expert.
We need a green thumb.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know...
Come on, do it.

VERA:

- can I have a word please?

BOOMER:

What do ya reckon that is?
Oh, it's probably her transfer knock-back.
Official paperwork's probably arrived.
_
- Oh, shit, that doesn't look good.

Are you all right, lovey?
- Dor, what happened?

- Nothing... everything...

- good...

- Guys, I got parole.

- I can't believe I got parole.

- and I'm getting out tomorrow!

- (whooping and laughing)

- Can I look?

(all celebrating loudly)
MALE: (over PA) Attention, compound.

- Phones are now available for use.

(voice-mail message) Hi, it's Nash.

(beep)
Hi, Nash, it's me.

Oh, some good news.
(laughing) I made parole, and, oh, it's a bit of a shock but... they're releasing me tomorrow, and, uh...
Look, I really, really need to speak to you, so I'll, um...
I'll try again later, okay?
I love you both.
(dark whooshing flourish)
I heard you got parole.
(ominous tone intensifying)
You okay?
Wh... what would you care?
(tone abating)
Is that so hard to believe?
(hushed) Yeah.
(ominous music)
I...

I felt we had a special bond...
- That's bull shit!

- of someone else.

It's not true.
It's not true.
(music abates)
(hushed) Don't you ever come near me again.
(music intensifies)
(music ends)
FEMALE: (over PA) Attention, compound.

Count will commence in ten minutes.
(door beeps unlocked)
Doyle... count's coming up, time to get home.
(exhales)
This'll never be home, Mr J.
Fair enough.
(indistinct background chatter)
- (atmospheric music) - _
- How'd you go?

Some arsehole tipped them off.
- Maybe you were wrong about the bins?

Mercado was there waiting to pick up the delivery.
So, you caught her red-handed.

Only for having a shiv.

Well, at least you know one thing for sure.
What's that?
There is definitely a dodgy officer.
- (drum beats added to music) - (cell door clanging)
(keys jangling)
- (drum beats end) - (cell door creaking and banging)
What the fuck just happened?
I just saved your arse is what just happened.
You let us walk into a shitstorm.
Who do you think called off the delivery?
What?

There wasn't time.
I heard about the raid and had just enough time to call the supplier.
So now we are fucked again.
We'll just have to find another way.
(flood lights flicking on)
- Do you reckon we should get Allie?

- Did you have a chance to talk to her?

- She's not gonna do anything stupid.

- That's all right.

Hey, pressie here
- from Sonia.

- whatever that is.

So, are you excited yet, darlin'?
Oh, it's all going by so fast,
- it's doin' my bloody head in.

Do you wanna know what the best thing about getting out is?
What?
- Not shitting in your own bedroom!

- BOOMER:

Yeah!

In your own house, with Nash and Joshy.
You and Nashy, like, goin' at it,
- like rabbits.

- LIZ:

All right, girls.

Now, listen... we're gonna have to make a toast and I volunteer Franky.
- Oh!

Why, is someone leaving'?
- (gasps mockingly) Boom!

(Doreen chuckling)
- (gentle music) - (dramatic sigh)
I love ya, Dors, we all do, and this place is way more bearable with you in it.
But we're gonna forgive you for leavin' us... because you belong on the outside with your other family.
Now, we're gonna miss ya heaps, but we will never forgive you if you fuck this chance up!
- No!

FRANKY:

- Get up off your arses.

Come on.

No fuckin' up!
ALL:

Dor!
- Woo-oooh!

- (chuckling)

(quietly sobbing)
Oh, love...
- what's wrong?

I can't get ahold of Nash.
What, not at all?
I keep gettin' his voice-mail.
Well, you try again in the morning.

I don't even know if he's gotten the message.
I mean, we haven't even had a chance to make any plans.
Dor... you're free... (breathing shakily)
(tearily) and you have a family who love you... and everything is gonna be amazing.
Isn't it?
- (hushed) Yes.

(sighs deeply)
(hushed) I love you, Doreen.
- (slow whooshing flourish) - (music ends)
(birds twittering)
- (Franky sighs quietly) - (keys jangling)
Yeah, I can't work out if I'm
- happy or sad.

Oh, I think it's all right to be both.
Yeah, then I'm both.
Just remember it's a happy day for Dor, that's...
Yeah.
- INMATES:

(all cheering and clapping)
INMATES:

INMATE:

- (melancholy music) - (crying)
(tearily) Oh, sh... oh, shit, come here you big sook.
(both chuckling and crying)
Oh, you can talk!

I know.
I don't want you to go.
- Well, I do but I don't.

- Yeah?

(crying quietly)
(hushed) Some bitch has ripped off my cash!
- (music ends) - (crying quietly)
FERGUSON: (insincerely) Oh, dear, and after all you've done for these women.

Was it a substantial amount?
A fuckload!
(plane engine decelerating)
(echoing drum beat flourish)
(faintly ominous grating flourish)
Ha!
(door buzzes unlocked)
Hey, I've got a psych appointment in ten minutes.
All right, come on then.
(inhales deeply) I'm so nervous.
God, do you remember how scared and messed up you were the first day you came here?
- Yeah.

Oh... well, look at you now.
God, you're walkin' out of here a beautiful, strong, proud woman, Dor.
You know, not many of us can say that prison made us a better person, but you can.
Hey?
- You saved me, Liz.

(sniffles)
No more tears,
- okay?

- DOREEN:

Time to go, Anderson.
- Okay.

No, not Dor, she got family.
- LIZ:

Has anyone seen Franky?

(quietly crying)
(quietly sobbing)
(Doreen laughing)
Doyle's waiting for her 3:00 o'clock appointment.
Oh, I thought she was booked in for tomorrow.

Hey...

Did I stuff up?

Sorry I'm late.
Oh no, it's no drama.

So, what have you stolen this time?
What, you want to check my pockets?
What I want is to stop having to cover for you.
- What are you doing here?

Came to see you.
You know you promised me.

Yeah, I know.
And I believed you, again!
I'm not doing this anymore, Franky.
Look, I'm doin' it for us.
I won't do it again.
Get out!
- I'm sorry.

(door opens)
(door closes)
(ominous music)
(inhales) Got enough money now.
So you have.
"Law of supply and demand", you said.
(inhales)
There's your fuckload of cash.
Where's my gear?
(Allie scoffs)
That's ten times the going rate!
- FERGUSON:

Now, you've been holding out on me.
- (scoffs)

- Where did you get that?

You said that I could have anything from your cell that I wanted.
Not that.
Warned you the price would be high.
Hmm.
(drum beats flourish)
- No, please...

(inhales) No, no, no, I won't.
You will.

(fan whirs)
You want the drugs, don't you?
Then you will burn it.
Page by page.
Let's go.
(inhales) Wait!

Out, bitch, it's Ferguson's time!
- (Allie groans quietly)

Leave her, she's nothing to worry about.
(uneasy undertone intensifies)
(laboured breathing)
Look at you.
(undertone becomes ominous)
- (breathing shallowly) - (drum beats added to music)
Worthless.
(moans quietly)
Nothing.
- (weakly) Help.

- your pathetic existence.

FERGUSON:

(groans quietly)
Do you?
- (quietly whooshing flourish) - (groans quietly)
- But you're filthy.

(gasping and crying)
You're a filthy whore.
A little Top Dog whore.
(crying quietly)
- (gasps)

- aren't you?

First Kaz and... then Bea, and now me.
Come on, get clean, huh?
(splutters)
(hushed) You like to fly in our orbit,
- even if you burn your wings.

(hushed) Little star-fucker!
(Allie exhales)
If only Bea could see us now.
(sighs slowly)
FERGUSON: (gasps) Arrrgh!

- (Allie gasps and pants) - (music pulsating)
Ah-huh.
Ugh!
(panting heavily)
(Allie breathing heavily)
Ah!

(gasps)
- (thud) - (echoing drum beat flourish)

ALLIE:

- Please!

- Do it!

- So you can be with your Queen Bea.

- (breathing heavily) - (crying) Do it!
Please!
- (breathing heavily) - (crying)
No.
- (breathing heavily) - (crying)
There's no easy way out for you.
Ah, help!
(coughing)
(coughing and gasping)
(coughs)
(gasping)
When Bea came to kill me, I overpowered her too.
(hushed) Hell no.
She threw herself on her own shiv.
She sacrificed herself so she could be with you.
(laughing mockingly)
But here you are, huh?
(spluttering and coughing)
- The love of your life just...

(gasps)
- (hushed) died for nothing.

- (gasping and panting) - (shower curtain rustles)

(sobbing) Oh, I'm sorry.
(sobbing)
(hushed) So sorry.
(sobbing)
What the hell happened to you?
(sobbing) I was so close.
I had the needle in her neck but I stuffed it up.
How are you still alive?
(sobbing)
Come here.
- She could've killed me

but she wouldn't do it.
- I wish she had.

(crying)
She said Bea died for nothing.
- (sobbing)

(sobbing) I wanna die.
(gentle music)
- (sobbing) - (sighs)
I got up on the roof today, to check it out.
I felt the breeze on my face.
I could see over the walls, to the horizon.
There was only one locked door between me and the outside.
Now, I'm gonna get out... and I'm gonna find out who killed Pennisi... and you're gonna come with me.
What?
Fuck this dying shit!
Now, you need to get out and you need to live a happy life.
That's the revenge you get on Ferguson.
Oh, you're serious.
- You're on.

(echoing thud)
