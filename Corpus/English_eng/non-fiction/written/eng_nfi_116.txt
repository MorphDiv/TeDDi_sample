But I'm not an alcoholic.
Yeah, don't open with that.
Well, I did the one thing that no comic's ever done.
I got my shit together.
I could put together a group of women, make them pee their pants faster than bad Nielsen ratings.
You could call your special Girls Are Funny Too.
Edgar, Melvin and I served together.

Who's the cute blonde you got going up here?
[Marty] Does the Texas Jew thing?
We agree to this, the project moves forward?

[Goldie] You're in.
You told me that my act wasn't ready.
Who said anything about doing your act?

[Cassie] My uncle was the town drunk, which in Wink, Texas is an elected position.
Uh, it's one of those rare positions where falling down on the job is actually a requirement.
I moved to Wink when I was ten after my parents died.
They went to Heaven, and we went to Wink.
I know, but some of this new stuff is really starting to play out there.
