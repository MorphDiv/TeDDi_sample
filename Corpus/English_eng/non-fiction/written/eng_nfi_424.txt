Ferdinand.
You came back.
How did you know?
Shit, I passed out, sorry.

Not a thing.
It's too quiet.

What's not to like?

- Get Kira up before you come up.

Corrected by F@R
Kira?
- Coming!

- I'm right here.

Okay.
- That is Charlotte.

- Hi.

So, you're what my mum looked like.
Yeah.

Yeah, they'll be safer with my ex.
Plus my daughter'll get a kick out of it.
I don't get it.

Yeah, Anger's AWOL, too.

Rachel must've shown the cabal our proof of P.T.'s real identity.
Those men on the board, they're realising they've been had.
- They're scrambling to protect themselves.

Well, she's certainly a liability.
Yeah, come on.

Hey, here's one.
There is nothing I wouldn't do for my friend.
I have no notion of doing things by halves.
It's not my nature.

It is Jane Austen.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Hundreds of millions of people are about to be required to submit their DNA, and Neolution is behind it.

Okay, so you wanna spend the morning safeguarding the genetic future of humankind, or do you wanna have brunch?
We have a Skype date.

- You calling them or what?

"Us"?

Oh, wait for it, chicken.
Hello, North American scum!
We bought a shit mountain of cheese.
Welcome back.
- Hey, you're home!

Tonight's my big "coming out" party.
- Your art opening?

Do you think that's a good idea right now?
- No, yes.

And I'm really sorry that you can't come, Cos.
What?

How're you gonna come?

This is my first show in two years.

- I can't do it.

Ezra Lue, this gallerist that we met in Geneva.
Adele's making appetizers, the Hendrixes are helping set up, and you can totally come later if you want to, I promise.
I do.

But, Mum, if P.T.'s lost the board, that means Neolution's on the ropes.
Yeah, so well done, everyone.
Felix and Adele, dirt well dug.
Delphine, you showed us what to do with it, and we deserve a breather tonight to stand down and support Felix.
I think you're right, Siobhan.
- I think we've earned a break.

Well, it's settled.

Thank you for letting me stay.
I don't have a family any more.

What?
When did Mark die?
Two weeks ago.
How did you find me again?
Well, you told me about Sister Irina, how she...
That you and the other nuns locked you up and how she came to the new world after they cut out her tongue.
You don't trust me?
I don't blame you after what my father did to you.
He is dead.
These are miracle babies.
I'm sorry I came.

You still have family.
You see?
They remember you.
They're saying hello.
All right.

It's fine with me!
Yeah, but left, right?

Whatever you think.
Okay, this is a test right?
I'm gonna do something, and then you're gonna lambaste me for doing it wrong?
No, I'm not gonna micro-manage you, Donnie.
- Is that what you're wearing?

Should I untuck?

Donnie, it's perfect.
I need a straight man behind the bar.
Oh!

Thank you!

- What?

You'll need your sisters, and I have a performance idea.
Yeah, she brought the Korg.
Oh, God, no.
- You ready for that whisky, Adele?

Just three fingers, please.
Okay, we're not done yet.
We need to still go after this Al-Khatib guy.
The Neo bag man?

I mean, he's so protective it's not even funny.
If he is bribing governments for citizens' genetics,
- then we've gotta...

Why don't you help Adele with the snacks?
Oh, that would be great.

Great.

Where are you off to?
I'm just, uh, going to get some flowers.
- Mum!

You're a worrier, and I've told you everything I know.

We can't stand down yet, but that's exactly why I need you at the opening.
Look out for your brother, make sure there's no trouble.
SCOTT:

Yeah.
Depending how much of the cellular culture survived,
- we can manufacture twice that again.

You go around inoculating LEDAs with it?
Yeah, that's the plan.
But we still don't know how many there are.
Well, that's what we're gonna find out.
Right, Scottie?
- Where you going?

I thought we were all heading over to Felix's together.
I'll catch you guys later, okay?
Sure.

Ta.
Hey.
- You ready?

Wouldn't it be safer if the others knew?
We have one shot at this, and if it's gonna work, Sarah can't know who we dealt with to get here.
What about after?
After you go to the opening like nothing happened, then I will send you instructions there.

- Yeah.

I so love being in the middle of all of this.
Um...
Rachel.
Rachel was rather impressed with our transgressive little alliance, weren't you?
It made me sick to work with the man who killed MK.
Sarah doesn't know you two are here, does she?
No, it's just the four of us.
Our interests are very firmly aligned as you now have a nice, big, fat target on your back, too.
So...
Neolution goes down for good, or we all do.
This is a summary of the evidence we've amassed so far, but we need you to help us prove it.
I'd like to talk to you.

You'd be dead if I hadn't called him in to save you.
After you.
So we spiked our Gluvine with vodka...
Gluvine and intrigue.

And, um, Felix and I, actually, got some serious apr√®s-ski cred by the end of it, but Delphine was, like, all business.
What was S even doing with her out there?
I don't know, I mean I only met her the once.
- Who else was she meeting?

And we don't have time for this.

Westmorland wants unprecedented access to human genetics, and Hashem Al-Khatib was bribing governments worldwide to get it.
But you don't have record of any of that, do you?
No, but Neolution want to sell curated commercialized evolution to the one percent who can afford it, so they can live forever, grow a bloody tail if they want to.
The rest of us, Coady's department, targeted for sterilization.
How's that sitting with you these days?
You saved my granddaughter.
I'm willing to take a gamble on nature over nurture.
This is all the supporting evidence to our claims.
Without proof of bribes, it will barely carry a news cycle.
You're a smart woman, Rachel.
Like any good CEO, you kept a shadow file.
A record of where the bodies are buried.
Give me the proof I need to back this up.
Give yourself a chance to be truly free.
Let Cosima make an appearance!

- Yes!

What I need is for you to leave right now before people start arriving, and something clone-y happens.
- Alison...

It's already happening.
Right?
Oh...
- Shit.

Hello.
- Oof, I've come early.

Hmm.
Oh, this is my, um, foster sister, Sarah.
You, uh, you Colin, then?
Cool.

- You all right?

I ID'd your dead body.
Yes, but we got over that, didn't we, Colin?
- Did we?

- I think we did.

- Hey!

Hello!

Congratulations.
Both of you.
That book is about your life?
Yes.
It's for my babies.
It's my joys, and my pain and sorrows, so they walk a brighter path.
Sister Irina is going to town,
- so we have to take care of toilet.

Cleaning.
- Come, when you are done.

Gracie.
- Hello, Mark.

Have you found her?
No.
I couldn't find her.
Gracie,
I'm depending on you, I don't get the cure otherwise.
I'm checking another convent tomorrow.

I miss you, Mark.
Yeah, I miss you too.
I love you.
Is she lying?
Oh, good lord, don't look now.
- Ezra Lue is here.

Ezra Lue, he's the gallerist from Geneva.
He's got spaces in London, Paris and L.A., and I'm quite sure I oversold myself.
Well, then do something!
Come on, do something unique!
Cosima is dropping off Scott.
Maybe you could use us.

All right.
- Clone swap.

Donnie, get the champagne, and put Cosima on standby.
The music!
Now drop the accent, and be yourself.
Ezra.

Felix.
Gentlemen, I would like you to meet my sister,
Hestia, goddess of hearth and home.
Ah!

We know so much, yet so little.
- Where do you live in the real world?

Oh, and this is my husband, Donnie.
Champagne?
Napkin?
No alcohol for me, I need to drive the soccer bus.
You look different.
Yes, well, I'm always different.
Identity is a social construct, boys.
Danke.
My God, that was completely perfect.
- They must be confused.

Okay.

- Go, go!

- Felix, are we clear?

Felix!

- Oh!

- Congratulations!

God, you look so rosy-cheeked!

Yeah, I'm back, and I'm back to bounding.
Yeah, you are.

How do you feel about long stares and large groups of people?
Ooh, no.
If you're gonna show up, you're gonna show off, darling.
Scottie, curtain.

May I present to you
Metis, goddess of wisdom and of deep thought.
Brilliant.
Just do whatever comes naturally.
Okay, well what are you saying, Sarah?
We're late.

I am dressed.

Your mom is at the florist, hon.
She's thinking about your brother.

S said last week that she's got some other source, so I'm trying to figure out...
Do you have any idea how hard your brother's been working for tonight?
Yeah, my brother's got a problem with me, he'll tell me.
Well, why don't I tell you my problem?
The entire time that we were gone, he was painting you, different versions of you.
But you don't seem to care.
And Delphine, I don't know if it helps chill you out, all she did was whatever Siobhan told her to, all right?
The only thing I know is a phone call about a meeting with some French guy.

- Ferdinand?

He killed my sister.
Oh.
This is a bloody goldmine.
Do you realise what we could do with this information?
- Yes.

She needs me.
I'm the one with a smoking gun.
Names, dates, and amounts.
A full record of worldwide influence payments.
Oh...
I bloody love you.
This...
We could squeeze anything we want out of these Neo-pricks.
It's just...
It's the fortune we dreamed of.
Freedom from all of them.
I gave Sarah her daughter back.
I don't owe them anything.
Why am I getting texts from my sister saying that you and S are up to something?
I don't know, Felix.
Maybe it's because we are up to something.
Great!

- Tequila?

- Claro.

- Si.

Chin chin.
Oh, my God.
- Art.

Um, she's on her way.
Is everything all right?
Just let me know if she gets here, okay?
Oh, you'll know.
Van Leer confirmed the meet.
They're assembling in an hour.
The board is in disarray.

They won't be when they hear we're taking a cut of all their future business.
Breathe.
Just let it pass.
There's another way.
We can choose to make my information public.
I have a sizable nest egg.
It wouldn't last forever but if we wanted we could destroy Westmorland and Neolution.
Go somewhere warm.
Off the grid.
I can see it now.
Lounging around at low tide in our flip flops, browsing Reader's Digest, dipping toast points into egg yolks.
Glorious.
With this...
We can build a dynasty.
Obscene wealth.
Anything we want.
Who's your Daddy?
You are.
You like it that much?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, it's just...
We're on the precipice of being able to do anything that we want.
What do you wanna do with our freedom?
- I want...

- Sarah's here.

- No.

- You...

You are one of our best guys.
- Best?

- Well, that's exquisite company, isn't it?

I think so.
- Sold.

- Thank you.

You own me.
- Hey.

You're mine.
Arms up.
- Incredible.

I don't know what S did, but tell Sarah that she...
- Tell her yourself.

- I love you.

Oh, my God.
All right.

- Is S here?

- Crap, I dropped my hushpuppies.

Do you know who's S's real source was, the one who got us to Coady?
I'm not doing this right now with you.
It was Ferdinand.
- What?

She's in league with him.
I think her and Delphine are cutting a deal with Rachel.
Shit.
That's terrible.
That's brutal.

But Donnie, curtain!
Athena.
Goddess of war.
Don't.

Turn around or I'll kill you.
Just take the stage.
You think this will work in the new space?
Big time.
Where's Delphine?
She left.
And in a hurry.
Some shit's going down.
Yeah, Anger, she's gone AWOL.
So, I think I better stick around for a bit
- just to be safe.

Keep an eye out for S, yeah?
Yeah.
Hey.
Clean floor, dirty heart.
Gracie, it's me...
We need to know if you found her yet.

Please.
Mark is sick.

- Coady?

I knew it when I saw you.
Which is why I told them I couldn't find you.
I didn't tell them where you are.
- You didn't?

- But you use this phone.

They will trace it.
We have to leave.

Gentlemen, ladies of the board.
Well, Rachel has a bit of a headache I'm afraid.
She plucked out her own eye.
Well, you seem to be missing some teeth.
Empty seats?
- Suicides.

That must be like Neolution Black Friday.
The shame.
Titans of industry.
Sucked in by a lie not even a child would swallow.
Not all of us were deceived.
Oh, Mr Al-Khatib with your dirty hands, so glad to hear you say that.
We no longer take our direction from Mr Westmorland.
Show us the evidence and tell us how much you want.
Enclosed are a list of key PaySends in six areas.
Food, pharmaceuticals, cloning, gene editing, sequencing.
Bio-surveillance.
So, yes, every time a technician blinks we will get paid.
But judging by the size of these bribes, you'll all be making billions anyway.
May I?
He won't be coming back.
You're doing the right thing, Rachel.
To the wrong man.
The only one who ever really loved me.
We do what we can.
Each of us in our own way.
And, we do it for each other.
Chipping at the devil till he's done.
There, uh...
Seems to be some, uh, technical difficulties.
He has nothing.
Hands on the table where I can see them.
Sorry about that, old chap.
Rest assured this is not over.

I have food for us.
Come, Gracie, we have to go.
This Neo is shit!
Easy there, pumpkin.
We don't wanna harm your cargo.
I'm sorry.
I know.
It won't hurt.
It's okay.
You're forgiven.
Hey.

Why wouldn't I be?
- Incoming.

I'm sorry, love.

You've worked with MK's murderer.
I knew you couldn't stomach it.

- Hey.

Hey, what the hell's going on?
These are for you.
- Flowers!

What did you pull with Rachel?
She gave us the missing piece of the puzzle.
Full financial records of Neolution's dark money bribes.
- What?

Proof of decades of illegal human experiments and of Coady's sterilization plan.

You're serious?
Yeah.
It's done.
This is it?

Yeah.

And ready to send all the regulatory and oversight committees in the affected countries.
As well as to all journalist friends of Siobhan at The Guardian.
You guys did all this for us.
You ready?
Just a sec.
Hello.
I would like to start by thanking you all for coming.
Um, and I'd also like to thank you all for buying.
- Whoo-hoo.

- Oh, Christ.

My sister Sarah!
Bow.
My sister and I...
My sister and I are orphans, you see.
And, um, we... could have ended up anywhere.
We could have ended up in any family.
And if we had, we would have been entirely different people.
But my mum,
- Siobhan.

- Come on.

She chose us as her own.
We are who we are because she carried two little London urchins on her wings to Canada.
Watching her raise my sister, watching my sister raise her own daughter,
finding my biological sister, it's quite mad.
It's taught me that we are all mysterious works of chance,
of choice, of nature versus nurture.
- Hi.

So to my galaxy of women.
Thank you for the nurture.
- I'm proud of you.

All right, now.

Music!
That was a death trap.

You expected them to kill me.
I told you what I wanted.
You chose not to listen.
What, we just ride off into the sunset when everything we have ever wanted was at our fingertips?
You expected me to take a payoff.
That is how we win!
No, we win if Neolution is exposed and Westmorland is stripped of his myth!
Where's your smoking gun, Rachel?
There's nothing for you here.
Oh, you gave it to her!
You can't hurt me.
No?
"Oh, please don't hit me, Daddy.
Let me hit you, Daddy."
I pay for everything
- to be under your heel.

I would have squirmed there forever, you heartless bitch!
Ferdinand.
Daddy.
Ezra over there wants to exhibit them in New York.
Oh, that's fantastic.
And he's also interested in my back catalogue.
- Oh.

- I can't believe it.

A little fighting creative spirit, even when you were tiny.
This is Colin, Mum.
Someday soon he'd like to come around for tea
- and asking for my hand, isn't that right?

- Colin, hello.

He does though have some rather piercing questions about some of my muses.
Oh, well...
You better settle accounts there before you come around to me then.
Well, I think we can work something out.
Yes, I'm sure.
Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready to raise some hell will the Wizard?
Let me hear you say "Yeah!"
Yeah!
‚ô™ My love isn't tainted It's just complicated ‚ô™
‚ô™ We're saving the world from down in the basement ‚ô™
‚ô™ I saw the truth I just couldn't face it ‚ô™
‚ô™ All of these people, They've been duplicated ‚ô™
‚ô™ But they can't contain us We're breaking the cages ‚ô™
‚ô™ Lab rats got out of the mazes ‚ô™
‚ô™ Civilisation, alternative patience ‚ô™
‚ô™ We won't be complacent We're changing the station ‚ô™
‚ô™ Right now Gotta run away, gotta get away ‚ô™
‚ô™ Gotta keep up They don't hesitate ‚ô™
Siobhan.
Ferdinand made it out.
- I thought he might.

Be careful.
Thank you, Rachel.
Good bye, Siobhan.
‚ô™ This tainted love you've given ‚ô™
‚ô™ Take my tears and that's not nearly all ‚ô™
Well, that's a bloody mess.
Do you wanna shoot first or ask questions?
Hello, Siobhan.
Welcome home.
Were you really gonna shoot me coming in my own door?
- In the leg.

No.

Bigger than holes you can put in me with that 9mm.
Won't make much of a difference in the throat, love.
Or we put them down?
What have you done with my future?
She just wasn't that into you.
I'm not talking about Rachel.
Oh, shadow file.
Oh, is it on the shelf over there?
Where you stashed the gun I took this clip out of?
No.
The thing is...
It's all going public right now as we speak.
Well, the thing is if you are gonna stash a weapon you should keep it close to you.
And that's just a little twisted...
Shite...
Where's S?
Left ventricle.

- Right.

Such grit.
I'll take a mercy tab.

Really?
I have to admit I'm a little disappointed in you.
Would you pass me that photograph at least?
Aw.
Not on your life.
Quite enough lip out of you.
You know, as a woman,
I'm 14% more likely to survive a gunshot wound than you.
Maybe not this one but...
Okay, it's been a good one.
Chickens.
