Kirkman:

Am I missing something here?
Because as far as I can tell, Kimble took a trip to Turkey during her first year in Congress, six months later, co-signed a bill providing them with further military assistance.
Turkey's been a member of NATO since 1952, so this is pretty standard practice.
What's the big deal?
It's the optics, sir.
It appears as though she's accepting gifts in return for military favors.
I don't care about the optics.
There's no sign of malfeasance here.
No, sir, but it's implied.
And this is a town that loves to connect the dots.
She stayed in hotel suites in Ankara and Istanbul and had lavish meals.
What was she supposed to do, check herself into a cell and survive on bread and water?
The military-aid package included the latest in digital-surveillance technology.
And, at the time, the Pentagon was strongly advising against giving it to Turkey.
It was a controversial measure.

Everyone on that trip voted in favor of it.
Circumstantial at best.

I co-sponsored it with Representative Holden of Ohio, former Chair of the Armed Services Committee.

This is the camera that covers the main entrance.
This camera covers the side, and you see him walking there.
He walks two blocks north to Union Station.
Then we got him on camera passing an ATM machine.
Next we pick him up in the parking garage where he jacked the minivan.

Here's where Maryland State Police spot him entering Annapolis.
A unit attempts to pull him over, which leads to a high-speed pursuit.
