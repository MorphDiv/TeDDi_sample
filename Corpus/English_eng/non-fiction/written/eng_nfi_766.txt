You got a spare room?
I would like to lead the mission to the Iron Sisters.
An image of a rune.
The Sword needs angelic energy?
To activate the Sword, it must be wielded by an angelic being, and struck by a bolt of lightning.
I thought this was all behind you.
(GASPS)
(RUNE SEARING)
(SIGHS)
After all these years why ignite your Circle rune, hmm?
What's your game, Cleophas?
There is no game.
I did what I had to do after the Uprising, but I never stopped believing in you.
You were all cowards.
Giving up the minute you thought I was dead.
Becoming an Iron Sister was about survival.
It was that or a death sentence.
You're following in your mother's footsteps.
That's very sweet.
When I met your daughter, and heard that you were alive, I knew there was hope.
I knew I had a second chance.
And what do you know about Clarissa?
She created a rune.
Valentine, in all my training, I've never seen anything like it.
She's special.
You expect me to take you at your word?
I will prove it to you.
You know, old friend...
I freed you from your entombment, granted you shelter, and this is what you do?
(SHUDDERING)
I already have the Mortal Sword.
The storm is coming whether you like it or not.
Leave my daughter alone.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(DISTORTED SCREAMING)
(GASPS)
Hey, did you hear that?
Hear what?
That sound just now.
Never mind.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
I mean, how would they feel?
Well, I'm glad you didn't ask in front of the sushi chef.
Well, seriously, why do they call it fatty tuna?
I mean, that's a little degrading.
Hmm, well...
I don't think obese tuna sounds any better.
You know, as much as I love Tokyo and Prague, a bacon burger from the East Village isn't that bad.
The world is your oyster, Alexander.
Yes, you.
Open it.
It's supposed to bring you luck and protection.
Thank you, Alexander.
You continue to surprise me.
In good ways, I hope.
(JACE AND KAELIE GIGGLING)
(BOTH SIGH)
I haven't had a roommate this brazen since...
Well, since Casanova and I spent the night in the Doge's Palace.
(GRUNTS) Casanova?
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
Hmm.
All good?
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
Hey.
Hey.
Wow, you look...
Overdressed.
I don't really own an iron, so... (CHUCKLES) You have plans?
Luke's Maia.
Well, she's not technically Luke's.
I mean, they're part of the same pack, but that's...
Yeah, right. (CHUCKLES)
Uh, so, you guys are hanging out?
Yeah, I mean...
That's okay, right?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
No, I...
I just... (CLARY SIGHS)
I had this... (STUTTERS) I don't know, this really strange experience at the Institute,
If you need me, I'm here.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Go.
Have a good time.
You sure?
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
(CLARY STAMMERING)
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
I have to go anyway, so...
But don't worry about the wrinkles.
She's not gonna notice.
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)
(ALEC SIGHS)
Damn it.
I need to go.
Go do your job, Shadowhunter.
I'm not going anywhere.
(ALEC SIGHS) All right.
(KAELIE GIGGLING)
What's this one do?
Flexibility.
(LAUGHING)
Ooh, I like the sound of that.
(SIGHS) I'm a little tied up.
Not yet, you're not.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
You're welcome to join us.
I'm good.
Your loss.
I'll give you two a minute.
I wouldn't exactly call this hiding.
Aldertree wanted me gone and I'm gone.
Whatever it is, it can't be that bad.
So you're just gonna turn your back on us?
I told you I'm not discussing Clary.
I don't need a reminder.
(SIGHS)
This isn't you.
(SIGHS)
Any idea what this is about?
He's totally shut me out.
He's not answering my texts.
I don't understand what's going on.
What did we miss?
(SIGHS) Valentine?
Who else could it be?
Aldertree's heading to Idris to meet with the Council.
I'll go check with ops.
That you told her about your new rune?
You should know what it feels like when the people you care about shut you out.
Izzy, Jace told me it would be dangerous for anyone who found out.
So now I need to be protected?
(SIGHS)
I welcomed you in, Clary.
Saw you through training, rescued Simon every time he got into trouble, which is basically all of the time, and after your mom...
Izzy, I'm sorry.
(SIGHS) Look, we both care about the Iron Sisters.
We need to find Sister Cleophas.
We can do it together.
I'm kind of over this whole togetherness thing.
(SIGHS)
Oh, I was just walking to the ops center, and I heard something.
Well, now that you know it's just me, get back to work.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(GRUNTING)
On the house for my best tipper.
Never trust a stingy warlock, Maia.
Not when we have an eternity to acquire wealth.
I'll remember that.
What you got there?
A gift.
I can't remember the last time someone bought me one.
I'm used to people making demands.
"Reinforce the wards, Magnus." "Heal my broken heart, Magnus."
"Portal me to Paris, Magnus."
(SIGHS)
(CHUCKLES)
Is it from someone special?
I think so.
Are you Rufus?
What are you in the mood for, Shadowhunter?
Yin fen.
Dancing with the devil, are we?
Whatever it costs.
Rufus, my man.
I wish I could say it was lovely to see you.
Magnus, what are you doing here?
The question is, what is Rufus doing here?
He knows he's banned from North America indefinitely.
(SIGHS)
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
I'm here on business.
(GRUNTS)
Drug dealer business?
Isabelle, I don't need magic to know when I'm being lied to.
There's been a spike in the demand for yin fen and I have orders to find the source.
If you don't believe me, call Aldertree.
Apologies.
I've seen the havoc yin fen can wreak up close and personal.
Nearly cost my friend Jem his life.
Do you know where to look for the source?
Definitely not Rufus.
But if you wanna stop a yin fen distribution ring, you'll need to find the kingpin.
Any ideas on who that might be?
Probably one of the Night Children.
Yin fen is made from vampire venom.
When people get desperate enough, they go straight to the vamps.
Good to know.
This is dangerous business, Isabelle.
Be careful.
I always am.
I'm trying to figure out this new rune ability and...
I was somehow able to create a new rune.
I didn't even know that was possible.
Neither did I.
Luke, it was the most incredible thing.
Jace said not to tell anyone, but Cleophas was your sister, and if Valentine has hurt her or worse, I...
She could be working with Valentine.
Uh, no, she's so dedicated to the Iron Sisters.
When the Circle disbanded, she had to be.
She was a member of the Circle?
And she worshipped Valentine, followed him around like a little puppy.
When I finally figured out what Valentine was up to...
I'd lost my sister for good.
We have to get her back, Luke.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
By about two hours.
Not to mention my horrible sense of direction...
Just, um, grab a table and I will make you one of my specialty cocktails.
(MOUTHS) Okay.
Yeah.
You staying out of trouble?
Well, I haven't been kidnapped in a while, so...
She's cute.
Yeah.
There's nothing wrong with it.
You know what's great for anxiety?
Shadowhunter blood.
Excuse me?
Do you mean, like, me bite you?
With my fangs?
(LAUGHS)
The look on your face.
- (CHUCKLES) - (CELL PHONE RINGING)
I should go.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
There's no sign of her.
(CLEOPHAS BREATHING SHAKILY)
Luke.
(GRUNTING)
Lucian... (CLEOPHAS BREATHING HEAVILY)
Help me.
Bloody Mary?
Minus the Mary.
Thank you for this.
Um, you got a little...
(JACE WHISTLES)
Smooth.
Is this the only bar in Brooklyn?
Wow, you must have a death wish.
Isn't it time we kissed and made up?
Or I could just rip your face off.
That's another way to go.
Can I have four tequila shots, please?
Guess some girls are immune to your charms, huh?
You know, there's always that one rare exception,
Why are you here?
(CHUCKLES)
You know, I didn't think hot-tempered wolves were your type, Simon.
Friends.
Shocking.
No.
Maybe, but... (SIGHS) What does it matter to you?
(SCOFFS) Like I need your charity.
You know, I'm perfectly capable of making a good impression on my own, thank you.
(CHUCKLES)
Wait.
(SIGHS)
Will you be my Obi-Wan?
Who?
Don't make me regret this.
Or have you forgotten all the names you called me?
(SIGHS) What happened at the Citadel?
Valentine's men infiltrated.
They killed Magdalena and took me.
(SCOFFS) Only you?
He brought me to New York, locked me up.
I managed to get a jump on one of his guards and fight my way out.
You can't seriously expect us to believe that.
I know where Valentine's hiding.
I can lead you to him.
(SIGHS) Luke, we have to do this.
I couldn't save your mother, but I'll be damned if I put you in jeopardy.
Please.
I know my sister's convincing, but you can't fall for her lies.
She's not that convincing.
I wasn't sure until she called me Clarissa.
Only Valentine calls me that.
Well done.
Now, what the hell are they planning?
That's what we have to figure out.
Not happening.
I didn't realize you had a badge.
This is our chance to make Valentine pay for what he did to Mom, to stop him before he hurts anyone else.
We need to do something now.
If he has the Sword, who knows what he'll do next.
Clary, we'll find another way.
I'm gonna go talk to the pack.
We're taking Cleo to the Institute.
(SIGHS)
Why do you think women are so attracted to me?
Apart from the obvious.
(SIMON SIGHS) Okay, um...
You literally slay demons.
Look, you gotta stop feeling sorry for yourself, and figure out what's... (SIGHS) Lacking.
Are you kidding?
Okay.
What's wrong with my hair?
You know, we'll circle back to that.
Why don't you just start by telling me, uh, what you do when you approach a girl.
Okay, um...
This is my James Bond impression.
It looks like you're low on fiber.
Perfect.
Look... (SIGHS) You gotta learn to play hard to get, okay?
No girl wants a guy with his cards already on the table.
No girl wants a guy who can't shut up.
(CHUCKLES) I can shut up.
Exactly.
It's never gonna work.
You wanna bet?
Oh, dazzle me, please.
What are you doing?
That's how it's done.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Where have you been?
Aldertree has me on a special assignment.
I'm checking out some rogue vamp dens.
I'm... tired.
Do you have a lead on Cleophas?
Then what is it?
It's about Magnus.
Look, um... (SIGHS)
Oh, my God, are you talking about having sex?
Can you not discuss my sex life with the entire Institute, please?
Alec, is this your first time with a man?
Your first time ever?
(CHUCKLES) It all makes sense now.
That's why you didn't want me to meet Jessica Hawkblue.
Wait, was there ever a Jessica Hawkblue?
Are you done?
Okay. (SIGHS)
You and Magnus...
You want to...
Just don't do what you always do.
And what's that?
Overthink it.
Like you're doing now.
No, I don't overthink things.
Look...
If it's what you want, if it makes you happy then go for it.
(CHUCKLES)
(SIGHS)
Pretty cold-blooded, turning your sister over to the Clave.
Remember that the next time the pack tries to question my authority.
It's time.
Kiddo, it'll be okay.
(GROANS)
(LUKE GRUNTING)
(MAIA SIGHS)
I thought that shift would never end. (CHUCKLES)
(SIGHS)
Have you ever been around drunk Seelies?
It's, like, one shot and they're toast.
And they won't stop with the Abba songs.
I thought I was gonna lose my mind.
Wanna get out of here?
I guess.
BAM's doing a Blade Runner marathon.
Are you expecting a call?
Not necessarily.
Did someone spike your blood supply?
'Cause you're acting really weird.
Weird can be good.
This isn't good.
So, when the Simon I agreed to go out with just decides to show up,
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Hey.
Hey, what's this all about?
I mean, I'm not complaining, but...
Alexander.
I may be experienced, but it's rare that I've ever felt this way about someone and...
I worry that once we...
That if we rush into this...
That I may lose you.
Look...
You're not the only one that feels vulnerable.
I want this.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
You realize by going against Valentine, you're risking your life?
He'll never forgive you for this.
I have to make amends.
- (DISTORTED SCREAMING) - (GASPING)
(GRUNTING)
(GRUNTING)
(GASPING) It's getting louder!
(DISTORTED SCREAMING CONTINUES)
It's not possible.
What is it?
It's not Valentine.
It is an angel.
Angel?
Here on earth.
I think he's holding him captive.
The angel is crying out for help.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Valentine how could you?
(DISTORTED SCREAMING)
(GROANING)
This is your chance to show your true form.
Together we will right all of the wrongs, Ithuriel.
His cry is so full of pain.
You said angels were rare, that almost no one had ever seen one.
It's unheard of.
Iron Sisters hear the angels whisper when we're forging our weapons, but even we've never seen one.
To communicate with one, you must be blessed by the angels.
No more lies, Cleophas.
I know you're working with Valentine.
You killed Magdalena, didn't you?
(SNIFFLES)
I thought his way was the only way to make the world a better place.
A safer place.
No matter what sacrifices had to be made, but harming an angel, holding him captive...
That goes against everything we believe in.
What, and killing Downworlders doesn't?
You don't understand.
An angel is pure goodness.
They're the embodiment of what Shadowhunters stand for.
If Valentine's harming an angel, then everything we love will be destroyed.
You are a traitor.
You're the Clave's problem now.
Let me take you to Valentine.
We have to free the angel.
Then I'll turn myself in.
No, why... why help me now?
Don't you see the storm coming?
If Valentine has the angel and a bolt of lightning...
Cleo, you hurt her, I'll drop you where you stand.
And what other kind of business do people like you have?
Looking a little under the weather.
There's just something I need.
The ultimate five-disc collector's edition of Blade Runner.
Instead I acted like a...
A replicant?
(CHUCKLES) I did, didn't I?
And that sucks 'cause you're smart and you're funny, and you get what it's like to be a Downworlder.
And all I wanted to do tonight was prove to myself that I'm not...
In love with your best friend?
Not where I thought this was going.
But it's the truth, right?
You're in love with Clary.
(SIGHS)
How do you know?
I have superior instincts for these sort of things, and...
I also have ears of a wolf.
I hear everything.
(SOFTLY) Yeah.
He brings out the worst in me, at times.
(GRUNTS) I knew it from the moment you said something about "best friend."
Look, here's an idea.
Instead of trying to go out with other girls just to prove something to yourself, why not just tell Clary how you feel?
Luke said to do the same thing.
(CHUCKLES) We're highly evolved beings.
What if you don't?
What if she falls in love with some Shadowhunter, and you spend eternity obsessing over how stupid you were?
Well, you know, when you put it like that, it... (CHUCKLES)
So, are we, um...
But I'm keeping this.
Cleophas, did you find Clarissa?
She is gifted.
There are things she showed me I didn't know were possible.
So... where is she?
(BOTH GRUNTING)
It is now.
If Valentine needs lightning to activate the Sword, he probably put Ithuriel up on the rooftop.
Cleophas could have been lying, Clary.
(GRUNTING)
(ALL GRUNTING)
(YELLS)
(GROANS)
I can't believe you were stupid enough to let Ithuriel go, when we were so close to achieving everything that we wanted.
I can't believe that you are siding with this dog.
I said let her go.
You Graymarks never see the bigger picture, do you?
What's the bigger picture, Val?
Lying to your followers, killing the woman you love, destroying your children piece by piece?
Sentimentality has always been your biggest weakness.
Maybe you've changed, huh?
(GRUNTS)
Because it reminds you of your betrayal?
How you stole Jocelyn and turned her against me?
If only I'd thought to bring a blade of silver, we could have ended this.
(VALENTINE SIGHS) You were always so spineless.
No!
(GRUNTING)
Damn it!
We have to hurry.
(GRUNTING)
- (GRUNTING) - (DISTORTED SCREAMING)
He's communicating with me.
He's...
(GASPS)
