Hey, Dave.
How's learning your lines going?
Lines are fine.
What I have a problem with is the glaring plot holes and character inconsistencies of this wackadoodle story.
Of "Peter Pan"?
To fly, all you need is fairy dust?
Such a shallow talent pool.
Plus, Ms. Gibbons always wildly miscasts her productions.
[Softly] I mean, Dave playing a boy who never grew up?
We're out of Metamucil!
[Sneezes]
Why are you rubbing your neck?
It kind of hurts.
Ken, please don't do that thing where you assume the worst-case scenario.
I am quite confident you have meningitis.
I feel like I teed that up.
You have the classic meningeal symptoms.
Neck pain?
My nap was on the bad couch.
[Giggles]
Get a load of this.
They taught a chicken to play tic-tac-toe.
A chicken, Allison!
What's wrong?
After my shower, I did a self-exam on my breasts, and I found a lump.
Ken, I don't know.
I just feel something on my left side.
Yeah, plus most of the time, lumps are benign.
It's like over 80%.
But, Allison, you know those numbers change when there's a family history like yours.
Like, your grandma, your aunt.
Ken, you're stressing me out over something that might be nothing.
[Breathing heavily]
[Exhales deeply]
[Door opens]
Okay, you're right.
We don't know anything yet.
We're gonna make an appointment with your doctor A.S.A.P.
I'll call first thing in the morning.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Until then, we're going to distract ourselves by learning about very smart farm animals.
That sounds like a great plan.
Good.
"His name was Charlie, and he was the cleverest chicken in the coop.
But Charlie had bigger dreams... "
Hey, Dad, can I use your med-school books?
A boy who never grows up...
I need to understand how that medically checks out.
Isn't it amazing how this guy throws himself into a role?
That's why he's always working.
So, have you called to make your appointment?
Can't forget this.
Look, it's okay to be scared to confront this, but...
[Inhales sharply] you have to make the appointment, okay?
[Both chuckle softly]
Not quite sure how to say this.
Uh, I found a lump in my breast and need to make an appointment.
[ Upbeat music plays]
[ Music continues]
Okay, when would you like to come in?
Uh, tomorrow or the next day maybe.
Let me see what we have.
I'm just gonna place you on a quick hold.
[ Upbeat music plays]
Unfortunately, the doctor is on vacation the next few days.
Let me check for you.
[ Upbeat music plays]
Cool, cool.
Can you just give me the next available appointment?
Okay, you're set for two weeks from tomorrow at 3:00.
Hey, Clark, could help audit my dating-profile photos?
You know, since Megan and I split up,
I've decided to, you know, give telephone dating a chance.
I didn't know you knew how to hang glide.
I don't.
But I know how to Photoshop.
I mean, if I use pictures of a typical weekend, it would just be me posting negative Yelp reviews of restaurants who wouldn't take a reservation for one.
And I really want to do all these things, so, you know,
I don't think of them so much as lies, as photos of my future.
You want to have a pet tiger?
More than anything.
I mean, why does dating have to be so complicated these days?
Damona, you're lucky you're currently entangled, if just to avoid all this nonsense.
[ Tiger roars]
Ohh...
A certain tattooed lady wants to chat.
You've been doing such great work.
I wanted to give you a pineapple.
Thanks?
I don't get a pineapple?
Hey, did you make that appointment?
I know, but my doctor's on a scuba-diving vacation in Aruba, and I didn't know what else to do.
She knows I like fruit.
You can see a different doctor, Allison.
Hey, I'm gonna make you an earlier appointment even if it means calling in fake shark attacks all over Aruba to smoke your doctor out of there.
Mostly in Aruba, too.
Apparently, it's sting-ray mating season down there.
Ken, it's okay.
You sure?
I want them to know.
Uh, just to put it out there, uh...
I found a lump yesterday.
[Sighs] Well, I'm having trouble getting an appointment with a surgeon.
Yeah, a-and take as much time with this as you need.
Thanks, guys.
Hopefully, it'll... it'll turn out to be nothing.
I just wanted to let everyone know what was going on.
Well, here's something else that's going on.
Hug coming in right now.
[Allison laughs]
Thanks, everyone.
Who are you?
I'm Carl.
Thanks, Carl.
[Sighs] Why do we have to come to Welltopia's most humorless doctor?
Okay, yes, Dr. O'Sullivan sucks as a person, a co-worker, and recycler, but he's a great doctor... and the only guy we could get on short notice.
I just wish he wasn't such a turd.
[Sighs]
Gosh, why does this have to be happening now?
Honey, honey, everything's gonna get done.
I'll take over all the play stuff, including the costume.
Thanks.
You know, it's... it's like this sculpture over here.
You know, you press down on one side, the other responds and picks up the slack.
Um...
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Oh, no bigs.
Just sitting here, waiting, looking, not touching.
So, what's the verdict?
Unfortunately, the ultrasound shows a solid mass highly suspicious for malignancy, and full excision is warranted.
I'm afraid so.
So, we need to schedule the procedure.
W-When can you put us on the books?
And, FYI, there's been tsunami warnings in Aruba, and if you think for one second...
Afterwards, it'll take about 24 hours to get the results back.
[Exhales heavily] Oh, man.
Any chance you could put me in a medically induced coma until the results are in?
[Laughs]
No.
That's not a safe or reasonable request.
I understand the wait's tough.
Try to distract yourself with something you enjoy.
Thank you, Doctor.
We'll see you tomorrow.
In the mood for anything?
It's 2017, but that's not what I'm talking about.
I overheard Mom on the phone.
Does she have cancer?
Um...
We don't know yet, sweetie, which is why we haven't told you anything.
She found a suspicious lump, and today we had it removed.
We get the biopsy results tomorrow, but until then...
Until then, we don't know.
[Softly] Yeah.
Dad...
[Sniffles] I'm scared.
And just... just know that it's okay to process these fears however you want.
Would you like to rip some hand towels in half, sweetie?
No.
Okay, no judgment.
[Sniffles]
Look, the best thing for us to do is to be strong and help her rest and relax.
Is there anything I can do to help you?
Actually, could you drive Dave to his play tonight?
I mean, I already finished his costume, but I'm not sure Mom will have the energy to go.
You got it.
It'll be okay.
Hey, uh, has anyone heard anything about Allison's biopsy?
Man, this sucks.
Uh, stuff like this reminds you how short life is.
Or I keep saying that I'm-a learn how to play tennis so I can play with my dad, but I never do it.
Uh, that's it.
This weekend, I'm taking hang-gliding lessons.
And if that's too heavy, I also made spaghetti,
Cobb salad, and even sushi, but it's basically rice and cucumber just balled up.
What are you looking at?
I've spent the last four hours
Googling all things related to breast cancer, tumors, and, in an odd rabbit-hole detour, how to escape if you've been kidnapped but still have your shoelaces.
I'm learning about zip ties!
Allison, why are you filling your head with that stuff?
You should be resting.
Why does it take so long to find out the results?
What if I do get sick?
Then you have to take care of the kids.
Promise me you're not thinking about that, okay?
[Sighs]
I even started typing out instructions on where everything is in the house and how to raise the children.
No, Ken, I-I need to say this.
I started typing, but I stopped because I realized you don't need it.
You've been so strong through all this that... that I know regardless of what happens, you and the kids will be fine.
[Exhales sharply]
[Crying] Thank you for making this all about me.
[Laughs]
[Sighs] So, let's get you some food.
[Sighs]
What's in the meatloaf?
[Both laugh]
This wait is just driving me crazy.
Well, Dave's play starts in an hour if you're up for it.
Though, children's theater isn't much better than waiting to find out if you have cancer.
Half the kids are mumbling their lines.
The other half [Robotically] are saying their lines like this!
[Both laughing]
It's like, "Hey, kids, ever heard of nuance?"
[Dramatically] No, they have not.
Let's go to the play.
I don't want to miss anything.
Um, you want me to pack up some of this food for you?
Um...
Maybe we'll just grab something on the way.
[Piano playing]
[Indistinct conversations]
[Softly] Hey.
[Gasps] What are you guys doing here?
Molly wasn't sure you'd feel up to it, and she wanted to make sure that Dave had some people here.
Well, speak for yourself.
I was drawn in by a blurb in the Calabasas Trumpet.
[Laughter]
So far, the Lost Boys were...
Oh, w-we know the story, sweetie.
Not this version.
Dave has made some interesting choices.
Nice job on the costume.
Also, I broke the sewing machine.
They say I'm a boy who never grows up.
I'm actually a 22-year-old man with hypoplastic kidneys... a disorder which can result in small stature.
Now that that's fully explained... hit it, Barb.
[Piano playing]
♪ Ooh ♪
If I stay a boy, I'll be safe.
I'll hide away in a magical place.
♪ Ooh ♪
But even here in Neverland, danger's always close at hand.
So you must be strong or at least try... ♪ To believe that you can fl-y-y-y ♪
[Applause]
[Laughs]
Oh!
Aaaaah!
Uh-oh.
[Scattered applause]
[Laughter]
This is what happens when you only use fairy dust to fly.
I need thrust, people!
[Laughter]
Whoo!
[Cheers and applause]
I'm so glad we came.
Did you see that news about Russia?
I was hoping you could explain it to me.
Okay.
The results are in.
The good news is... you don't have cancer.
[Exhales sharply]
[Sniffles]
Um...
Okay, so, what's the bad news?
It was an LCIS, or lobular carcinoma in situ.
It's an area of abnormal cell growth that isn't cancer itself but can increase the risk of cancer later in life.
But we removed all of it, and you don't need any further treatment.
[Sighs]
Just keep a close eye on it, and get your annual mammograms.
I will.
I couldn't have gotten through it without you.
Yes, thank you so much, Dr. O'Sullivan.
You really weren't our first choice, but you surprised us with how kind and wonderful you were!
Excuse me?
He just means "Thank you."
Oh, you put that back together.
No, no, no.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
This really means a lot!
Uh, this week just reminded me that life's too short to not go after what you want.
This is just... thank you, Pat.
I really a...
Pat, God!
You had to go and mess everything up.
Mnh.
Well, Dennis at the school paper sure is dragging his heels on reviewing my play.
What's he waiting for?
Yeah, you definitely stole the show.
You were laughing, you were crying.
I'm a star!
Well?
Ohh.
I feel like I'm missing some key information, but I'm gonna get in on this, too.
