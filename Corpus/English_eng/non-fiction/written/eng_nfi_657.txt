Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station.
Is that you, Lucy?
Director Cole.
You've been there all through the years, Lucy?
[Lucy] Well, actually,
I have gone home, and Andy and I have taken some vacations.
One year, we went to Bora-Bora.
Would you like to speak with Sheriff Truman?
Yes, Lucy.

Okay, I'll connect you!
[phone clicks]
- [intercom buzzes] - [Lucy] Sheriff Truman?
FBI Director Gordon Cole is on line one.
That's the blinking one, the one that's blinking right now.
Hello.
It's Gordon Cole, Harry, returning your call.
Uh, no, no, this is, uh,
Sheriff Frank Truman, Harry's brother.
Where's Harry?
[Frank] Harry's sick.
He's, uh, in the doctor's care.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'll give him your regards, sir.
What've you got for me, Frank?
Uh,
I just thought you should know this.
Uh, it's gonna sound strange.
Something's been found, something Deputy Chief Hawk found.
Missing pages from a certain Laura Palmer's diary that could indicate two Coopers.
I don't know any more than this, but, uh,
I-I just thought you should know it.
Uh, maybe it means something to you.
Thank you very much, Frank.
Although I can't comment on this information,
I want you to know I really appreciate it.
All right, Director Cole, uh, I understand.
[Cole] And all the best to you and all the best to Harry.
Thank you, sir.

Tammy.
Case number one.
This started the whole thing.
Nineteen seventy-five.
Two young field agents investigate a murder in Olympia, Washington.
They arrive at a motel to arrest a suspect named Lois Duffy.
They hear a gunshot outside her room and kick the door in.
They find two women inside, one on the floor dying from a bullet wound to the abdomen.
The other holds a gun, which she drops as she backs away when they enter.
They recognize the wounded woman as Lois Duffy.
She speaks her last words to them:
"I'm like the blue rose."
She smiles, then dies, then disappears before their eyes.
The other woman screaming in the corner, they now notice is also Lois Duffy.
[softly] Hmm.
By the way, Lois Duffy did not have a twin sister.
Then while awaiting trial for a murder she swore she didn't commit, this Lois hangs herself.
Those two arresting officers were Gordon Cole and Phillip Jeffries.
Now, what's the one question you should ask me?
What's the significance of the blue rose?
And the answer?
[exhales] Hmm.
Blue rose does not occur in nature.
It's not a natural thing.
The dying woman was not natural.
Conjured.
What's the word?
A tulpa.
Good.

Deputy Diane reporting.
Diane, that last night you saw Cooper... did he, by any chance, mention Major Garland Briggs?
I don't want to talk about that night.
I understand.
All I want to know is, did he mention Major Briggs?
[inhales] [exhales]
Fuck you, Gordon.
Yes.
Albert.
Diane, as you know, we've been investigating an old case of Cooper's involving Major Briggs.
Briggs died in a fire at his government facility 25 years ago.
Right.
We thought.
Turns out he died a few days ago here in Buckhorn, and... we found this in his stomach.
The ring was inscribed:
"To Dougie with love,
Janey-E."
Oh, my God.
What is it?
My sister's name is Jane, my half sister.
She's married to a man named Douglas Jones.
But everybody calls him Dougie.
And her nickname's Janey-E.
Where do they live?
[exhales] Last I heard, Las Vegas.
When did you last speak with her?
We're estranged.
I hate her, so...
I haven't talked to her in years.
Tammy, get the Las Vegas office on the line.

[Tammy] Las Vegas office, please.

Uh, I have Director Gordon Cole on the line for you, sir.

I want everything you've got or could find on a Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Jones of your fair city.
These people are wanted in connection with a double murder and may be armed and dangerous.
Put caution in the shotgun seat.

- [Headley] Yes, sir.

[Cole] Get back to me.
Your man has my info.
[Headley] Yes, sir.

There's 23 Douglas Joneses in the greater metro area.
How are we gonna find the right one?

Thank you, Diane.
Yeah.

Before I came up,
I was on the phone with Sheriff Truman in Twin Peaks.
He told me they are onto something from Laura Palmer's diary indicating two Coopers.
And last night, I had another Monica Bellucci dream.

But who is the dreamer?

A very powerful uneasy feeling came over me.
Monica looked past me and indicated to me to look back at something that was happening there.

[chuckles softly]
It's my birthday today.
[laughs softly] Is that right?
Well, happy birthday, Jimmy.
This is a real occasion.
So you really can't take that thing off, huh?
Nah, I can't.
I don't understand.
It's, uh, part of me.
Doctor tried to take it off once, and...
I started bleeding.
Where'd you get it?
I'm, uh, not supposed to tell.
It's my birthday, Freddie.

Come on, I'm not gonna tell anybody.
Eh, you ain't gonna believe me anyway.
So you may as well tell me.
Freddie, come on, tell me the story.
[sighs]
Come on.
Well...
I told the doctor.
I, uh...

And seeing as how it's your birthday.
[sighs]
I was still living at home, see?
Where was that?
That would be London Town, East End.
About six months ago, after a night down at the pub with me mates,
I'm walking home alone.
I get this peculiar feeling as I turn into this alley
I use as a shortcut.
It strikes me that I'm wasting me life, Jimmy.
Hanging about, hitting the pub every night, drinking, when I should be helping people.
With this feeling in me on this particular night,
I see in the alleyway a high stack of boxes, and I jumped, you know, like, for fun.
I jumped onto this high stack of boxes.
And all of a sudden,
I was sucked up into the vortex of this massive tunnel in the air.
Next thing you know,
I'm floating in thin air, way up somewhere, like a void.
And this bloke's there.
The Fireman's what he's called himself.
And he says to me,
"Go to the hardware store near your flat.
And there you will find a rack of green rubber gardening gloves.
One package will already be open, with only a right-handed glove inside.
Purchase that package and place the glove on your right hand.
Your right hand will then possess the power of an enormous pile driver."
Poof.
And I'm back in me room, waking up the next morning.
I got up, got out of bed.
- Dragged a comb across me head.

And I went downstairs and had a cup.
- [laughs]

Just kidding about that part. [laughs]
So I pop round the corner to the hardware store, find the rack of gloves.
And, sure enough, there's the open package with the one right hand.
Off I go to the counter, lay down the package for the clerk, and he says,
"I can't sell you that one.
You have to buy one that hasn't been opened."
So I say, "That's all right.

He says, "I can't sell you that one."
I says, "Listen, mate.
I want to buy just the one glove, and I will pay you full price."
"No, it's already been opened.
I can't sell it to ya."
Now, where I come from, we call a bloke like this a "jobsworth."
That is a person who delights in acting in an obstructive or otherwise unhelpful manner, as in, "I can't do that.
It's more than my job's worth."
[scoffs softly]
So I says to Mr. Jobsworth,
"Listen, I'm buying this glove."
And I put me bees on the counter and walk towards the door.
Well, Jobsworth leaps after me like a possessed puma, screaming that I can't have the glove from the package which has already been opened.
I bolt out the door, hit the cobbles, hoping to leave Mr. Jobsworth in the dust, slipping the glove on while I go.
Then he slows me down a mite.
And before you know it, Jobsworth puts a tackle on me worthy of a red card and sends me skidding on the field.
On instinct, to defend myself,
I popped Jobsworth one in the loaf with me green glove.
I hear a crack, and... by the way his head's tilting and him trying to talk... [inhales sharply]
I fear I've snapped his Gregory.
[inhales sharply]
And then, in that moment,
I remember something else that bloke up in the sky told me.
"Once you've got the glove on, go to Twin Peaks, Washington,
United States of America.
And there, you will find your destiny."
So here I am, Jimmy, on your birthday.
Many happy returns.
Wow.
Thank you, Freddie.

[laughs softly] The pleasure's all mine, sir.
[exhales] Why you?
I mean, why do you think the Fireman picked you?
Well, that's a good question.
I asked him myself, I said,
"Why me?"
And he said,
"Why not you?"
And when I went to buy me ticket to fly over here, they told me I already had a ticket.
Don't forget.
We're supposed to check the furnace.
Yeah.

Don't forget to sign the invoice.
I'm gonna go check the furnaces.
