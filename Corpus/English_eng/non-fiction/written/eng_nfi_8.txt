You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, can someone call a referee
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances Is it too late now to say sorry
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say that I'm sorry now I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say sorry now I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this Is it too late now to say sorry
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say thatI'm sorry now I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say sorry now I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say sorry now
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
