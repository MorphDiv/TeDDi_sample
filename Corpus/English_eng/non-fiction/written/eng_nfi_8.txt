Peter.
Your momma wants to speak with you.
Come on, Pete.

Why have you been fighting with the other boys again, baby?
Peter?
They killed a little frog that ain't done nothing.
Smushed it with a stick.
You're so like your daddy.
You even look like him.
And he was an angel.
- Composed out of pure light.

You got a present there for Peter, don't you?
Of course.
There.
I've got you covered, Pete.
You open it up when I'm gone, okay?
Your grandpa is gonna take such good care of you.
At least until your daddy comes back to get you.
Take my hand.
