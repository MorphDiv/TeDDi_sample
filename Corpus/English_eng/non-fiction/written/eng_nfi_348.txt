Hairy!
Hands on your head!
You must submit to the CA!
Hands on your head!
Have you run any tests?
Nobody's run anything.
I checked your vitals and hid you away in here.
Kept everybody else at arm's length... including your husband.
I can't go home.
Well, there's no rush.
No, I mean I can't go home.
It's not safe.
Charlotte, can we talk?
Give me a chance to apologize.
I hate arguing with you.
Are we ready to go if we need to?
We're prepped for fetal extraction.
And this group is being set up to mimic a subhuman womb.
The fetus will continue to develop normally?
Exactly as if it were in a healthy mother.
No danger to the mother with this procedure?
Any surgical intervention carries a certain risk, but the risk is not significantly greater here.
Excellent.
You hear that, boy?
It's killing me.
Means the past is reaching out to you, trying to show you something.
It's tied to this land, boy... and connecting to it will make you stronger.
Could you tell the past to be a little bit quieter?
It'll stop when you're strong enough to go home, boy.
Drink.
Now, drink this.
You'll get a warm, tingly feeling in your mouth, but it'll go away soon.
Hello, Aunty.
Now, you don't mind if we film?
Of course, dear.
Is it just you today or is your family here?
Just me.
You from around here?
My people have always lived on this land.
Moved out west when the boats came.
Your mob stayed out there?
Most of them.
Can't be jumping around, hiding all the time.
Too old for that these days.
21 is not that old.
Smoothtalker, aren't you?
Are you comfortable with the procedure?
Yes.
They said the blue stuff goes in and the green comes out.
Sounds simple enough.
Simpler than what's going on out there.
You must've seen a lot in your time.
The thing I remember the most... was this little human girl.
My family told me never to make contact with the humans.
But I used to watch them whenever I got the chance.
She had long, curly hair.
She was wearing the most beautiful dress.
That dress was the whitest thing you've ever seen.
And it had a blue ribbon wrapped around her like a belt.
Well, you don't see much of those dresses anymore, Aunty.
Drink up.
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
I'm thirsty.
Hey.
She's already had water today.
She'll learn the rules.
Just because Koen wants her here doesn't mean she gets special privileges.
Watch yourself.
My boy's just looking after people.
You happy crashing with this mob?
Yeah.
I saw your son at the warehouse.
The blue light thing coming from his chest, smashing through steel like it was nothing.
Can you do it, too?
What are you looking at?
Something's happened.
Yeah, no kidding.
Everything's gone to shit.
Genocide is what's happening, and my husband's in the middle of it.
Maybe he doesn't have a choice.
There's always a choice.
Why are you helping us?
Because you're decent people.
And Latani?
She's just like anybody else as far as I can see.
Very few people see Hairies that way.
Well, most have never met one, at least that they knew was a Hairy.
I mean, that's why the government's been so successful in stirring things up.
Nerida, there are some decent people in this city,
Yeah.
But it only takes one person to show others there's something worth being happy about.
From Mr. West.
Okay, no smiling for the photo.
This is for your ID.
Come on, no smile and we'll all be done.
Okay, good.
Hold it.
Congratulations.
Byebye, Yani, and hello to Gwen.
It's a beautiful name they've chosen for you.
My name is Gwen.
Trev, make sure you unpack that other truck.
And mop the floors when you're done.
Put your back into it, Trev.
Come on, Trev, today!
Confirm ID.
ID confirmed... fingerprint and hand recognition standing.
We were hoping that you might be able to tell us how it's been settling into Bennelong House.
Are you on your way home from work?
Excuse me.
So, before this city went to hell, what did you do for work?
What do you do?
A security guard.
So, you left the police force because...?
Well, when all the new security measures were brought in by the government, hundreds of police were redeployed whether we liked it or not.
If we objected, we lost all our entitlements and any other chance of government work.
I got security.
Come on, then, I'm gonna beat your Hairy ass.
From here to their various places of work.
Could've sworn it was your knight before.
You gonna argue with an old lady?
And this is Trevor.
Would you mind having a few of words with us, Trevor?
Can you tell us how it feels now to be a human?
Trevor, can we have a look at your place?
Excuse me.
Observe the same customs, and join in the hopes, beliefs, and loyalties that are the very things that make us human and set us apart from the animals.
I'll tell you two good things about the curfew.
What's that?
The city's dead quiet.
No cars, no sirens.
Nothing.
The second thing is... all the city lights are out, so you can finally see the stars.
Makes me feel like I'm back on country.
You see that big emu up there?
It's there, running full pelt.
All I see is the Milky Way and the Southern Cross.
You've gotta look at the dark clouds, not the stars.
All I see is stars.
You're powerful, boy.
Doesn't feel like it.
Don't have accuracy when I use the blue blast thing.
It's not a weapon.
It works like a weapon.
It's a power not to be messed with, boy.
Anyone who's caught in its blast can no longer move on from this life.
So, what, they become immortal?
Opposite.
They lose their essence.
Their soul?
Once they die, that's it.
They can't join their ancestors, they don't move on.
They simply cease to exist.
So, there's no trace of them left?
They've been obliterated?
Slade?
What's the point in having this gift if you can't use it the way you need to?
Stop forcing things.
Allow the powers to come through.
The place will be swarming with security.
I know Waruu.
He knows your people.
He'll make it impossible.
How do you know that?
I'm sorry.
Does that make you feel better?
It doesn't help me at all.
I'm just letting you know what you're up against.
I know what I'm up against.
Ignorance, fear, hatred.
There's none of that here.
And you need to remember who you're talking to.
Yes... the mother who shaped those two sons.
I'm not proud.
You're human.
You can drive me to Bennelong House.
I am not my son.
Take me to Bennelong House!
I'll do it.
Why should I trust you?
Because I'm the only one in this place who has valid ID.
Ever since the announcement, we've had a large number of Hairies come forward for the Initiative.
Well, you're making us both look good.
I'd call that a winwin, wouldn't you?
That's exactly what I'd call it.
Well, there's been some pushback, of course.
People worry that we're exacerbating the problem by making Hairies practically invisible.
We're making them practically human, negating the threat.
Subhumans were merely a myth a year ago.
What else is out there?
Hey!
Get away with him!
This is footage of an attack on some civilians a few days ago.
I need to know who or what that is.
Waruu?
Waruu?
"Two hunters would travel far from the camp to collect food for their family."
"The older hunter would always bring more back."
This was because he had a special boomerang.
His was much faster and would never miss.
The younger hunter asked the old people
"- where he could get a boomerang like this."
"The old people told him of a special tree,"
so the younger hunter headed out to cut himself a stronger and much larger boomerang.
But the younger hunter did not notice that the tree's blood ran hot and poured like lava.
It was the blood that made the older hunter's boomerang so powerful.
"It would cut through his prey, killing them instantly."
I haven't seen you in such a good mood in ages.
You got laid, didn't you?
All right, just pull up over here, okay?
We've got sections 95, 96, and 97 to do today.
Come on, focus.
So, where did you guys meet?
I said legit, man, you gotta drop it.
And it will remain that way.
Hey, heads up.
Hendricks.
In trouble?
Sir?
Now, what you do in your own time is up to you.
I'm interested in the guy in the hoodie.
Drives a red minivan, had a woman with him.
Last numbers on the plate were something like 971.
So, where's your boyfriend?
You don't know anything about him.
Alinta.
Mum!
What are you doing?
He's CA.
Grab your stuff.
Culture is difficult to control, and being a Cleverman forces you to be consumed by it.
Some people think that you're crazy.
The more they say it, the more you believe it, and you find yourself in a dark place where no words can help you.
If you couldn't handle everything, what makes you think I can?
Well, you've been dealing with this your whole life...
People talking about you, putting you down,
"the whore's child."
But it's molded you, shaped you for this role.
You're ready for this.
Boondee.
It's still me.
I thought I'd never see you again.
I'm here to take you home.
There is no home.
Latani and Djukara?
Djukara.
My boy.
I told him...
I told him to be calm.
Shh.
Latani.
There's Latani.
We need to find her.
But you're safe?
When you look like me... the CA don't shoot.
They prefer to pretend that I'm not here.
You are here.
If you give me your keys and a list of things you need,
I'm happy to go get them.
I can't ask you to do that.
It's fine.
I better go.
You're really scared of him, aren't you?
What's happened?
I can't say.
Might make you less scared if you talk about it.
Why are you sitting here in the dark?
Are you all right?
Not really.
What can I get you?
My DNA comes up as positive for subhuman.
Why is that?
My darling, we're having a baby, just like we dreamed of.
My God.
It's gonna be the healthiest child that's ever been born.
You did this?
Look, I know this is a shock, but once you...
You implanted something in me without my knowledge, something not human.
And that clinic, the doctors?
How many people, Jarrod?
How many people know what I'm carrying?
No one else knows, just you, me, and our doctor.
I didn't know how you'd react.
Can I carry this baby safely to term?
How long is the term?
Or is it just cross your fingers and hope for the best?
And you say that you love me!
I wouldn't do this unless I was sure it was safe.
You're risking my life!
You'll be safe, I promise you.
All right, show me, then.
Jarrod!
My God!
No, no!
Please don't hurt me!
Mum?
You can't fix the situation.
It's happened.
Learn from it.
You knew, didn't you?
Answer me!
Did Linda kill my parents?
Yeah, she did.
Well done, little brother.
You finally figured it out.
Linda's never been the woman you thought she was.
She's coldblooded.
She knew exactly what she was doing when she rammed their car.
She was after you, too.
The unborn child of the woman sleeping with her husband.
Sheer luck you're still here.
It's curfew.
I'm getting a drink.
You lied to me all my life.
I know why you came here.
Do you?
There's only one person in the world who knows how you feel right now...
Me.
We're brothers.
Nothing changes that.
Is that why you sold me to Slade?
And then abandoned your family...
Nerida, 'Linta.
Why'd you do it?
I was lost.
Made a mistake.
Look at this place.
No!
This is my place.
My place.
