All right, Bram, order's up.

No iPad at the table, please, Charlie sir.
Thank you.
- Good morning.

I'll get something there.
Daddy, look.
Pretty.

New one.
Dodgers signed new pitcher.
Guy from Villanova.
Hernando says his slider has starter potential.
Excellent, excellent.
- Hey, Dad.

What do you think about me coloring this gray?
Hey.
How you doing?
You've been on another planet for days now.
It's Devon.
What'd she do?
I'm not sure even I want to know all the details, but it's not good.
Could it blow back on you?
Okay, for real.

Think she got her hands dirty.
What are your options?
Tell the Bureau what I know or ask out.
Seems easy enough.
I mean, you don't have to make it about her, right?
It's been a few years.

Could be the high road for both of you.
- Maybe.

Hey.
We'll figure it out.
Either way.
I know.
I love you.
Love you.
- Break a leg.

- Morning.

Hey.
Minnie, I love you too, sweetheart.
Good morning, Katie.
- Hey, girl.

Hey, Devon, you gonna go catch some bad guys today?
Only if your dad doesn't slow me down.
Nice.

Hey, don't forget to...

Copy that.

Copy that.

We should cut over to Colorado.
All right.
Thank you, Hal.
It's maps, Mom.

Hal retired.

Now we're in the ocean.
Super weird.

Look.
Oh, my God.

Wh...

I know.
Come on, maps.
But... now we're in San Pedro.
That's all right.
I know how to get there the old-fashioned way.
Watch this.

I've had three brokers tell me that was the best price they could get.
Well, if you're gonna keep the house, then you're gonna be responsible for the payments.
Don't get mad at me.
This is what your lawyer mandated.
I can't do this now.

Morning, Alan.
Representatives from the textbook publishers are in your office.
Who?
- Good morning, Alan.

We are very excited to talk to you.
Who isn't excited about textbooks?
We aren't here about textbooks.
We're recruiting officers.
We're with an agency called the Institute for Global Advancement.
You're a man of vastly untapped potential, Alan.
Your current employment in no way suits your talents.
You were selected from a pool of tens of thousands of people.
I don't recall applying for anything.
You didn't.
Our clients have an algorithm that pre-selects their clientele for them.
And you happen to be the perfect man for the job.
- All right.

A one-bedroom condominium and a home where you used to live with your wife and your daughter.
You make your alimony payments on time, you help in paying for your daughter's private high school education, and you carry no unsecured debt.
- How do you...

How do you know all this?

You've also managed, over a period of nine years, to divert a large amount of cash from this institution into an account held in the name of your long-deceased paternal uncle, also named Alan Snyder.
You're a fascinating man, Alan.
Alan, even great men make two or three critical mistakes in their lives.
You don't get where I'm sitting by only making two or three mistakes.
It's the choices you make today that will determine your future.
All you have to do is say "yes."
"Yes" to what, exactly?
To meeting our client.
You been in your house, what,
- like three years now?

Since before Gracie went to school.
Oh, shit, that's right.
Man, time is flying.
Yeah, it is.
You remember your home inspection being so scary?
I don't.
Everything on that report makes it sound like my bungalow's gonna burst into flames as soon as I close escrow.
"So great you're gonna be a homeowner, Devon.
I'm really happy for you, Devon."
I am happy for you.
What's with you?

How'd you find the money to buy a place in Santa Monica?
What do you mean?
I know what I make.
Pretty sure I know what you make.
I've got an uncle who likes me.
Gave me the down payment.

Okay.
What?

I'm requesting a transfer.
You're leaving Los Angeles?
I'm staying in LA.
I'm just gonna ask off the taskforce.
Why?
Because your relationship with the Armenians makes me uncomfortable.
Is there something you want to ask me?
We have relationships with criminals so that we can catch criminals.
I don't wanna know any more than I already do.
What, so you're gonna accuse me of being dirty, but I-I can't defend myself?
I'm not asking you to defend yourself.
I'm just asking for a transfer.
Will, you're... you're questioning my integrity.
- I wanna talk about it.

You're unbelievable.
Five years we've been working together.
That's why I'm having this conversation with you and not the AD.
- Bowman.

All right, listen up.
Overnight, seven VIPs went missing in the LA area.
The Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, chief engineers at Lockheed and Boeing, an official with the Defense Nuclear Agency, and three senior military officers.
Now, it appears that at least three of them were extracted by a militarized entity whose origin, at the present, is unclear.
The others... well, the others are unaccounted for.
Your department heads have your individual assignments.
The goal is to bring these people back home safe.
Can you share any theories as to what this is about, sir?
Unfortunately, we don't know much of anything right now.
We're trying to keep this operation as small as possible until we know more.
We don't want to embarrass the Bureau or create a panic.
Thank you.
Still want to put in for that transfer, or you think you can suffer through another day with me?
Oh, my God.

You scared the life out of me.
Sorry about that.
I didn't know you were coming home.
Oh, my goodness.
Unplanned trip.
How's Mom?
She sleeps a lot.
I take her to dialysis Sundays, Tuesdays, and Fridays.
In between, we do small errands.
Grocery store, nail salon, those kinds of things.
Thanks for this.
Well, that's why you pay me the big bucks.
Hey, Ma.
I'm home.
My...
Go back to sleep.
This is weird, right?
Bunch of military intelligence guys and then engineers?
Who knows?
Some kind of coordinated terrorist attack, maybe.
Turn here.
I'm doing you a favor, you know.
I'm sure I'll appreciate it someday.
I think our VIP's been downgraded from "missing" to "abducted".
Hi, Special Agent Bowman, Special Agent Howard.
FBI.
Whatever that camera sees, it's not telling you anything.
We're here to help you.
If you're FBI, I want to see IDs.
Panic room.
What's going on?

I'm not coming out until it's safe.
Try to stay calm, Mr. Lawes.
The bad guys missed you.

Our bosses are very interested in a bunch of VIPs that went missing last night.
You were one of them.
If you don't want our help, fine.
Good luck to you.

Good morning.
I have 9:00 p.m.
Are you jet-lagged?
Thirsty.
Welcome home.
- NO SATELLITE CONNECTION FOUND

Sorry, I was hoping for some music.
God, I haven't seen you in an age.
What brings you back to the west?
Better?
Life changes.
I plan to start by wasting a lot more time here.
Good.

Thank you for your service.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Depends how personal.
You're a woman with a husband, couple kids.
Why the bar?
Purpose?
I grew up watching my mom dedicate her life to being a mother and a wife to a naval officer, and I... it was important to me that my kids see me as more than that.
Navy, huh?
Didn't know that.
"Not self but country."
This a career crisis we're trying to drown here?
I signed up when I was 19.
Same as all the other hotheads.
Thought I'd go whup ass, bring justice to a place that needed it, you know?
I do.

How was it for you?
Did my tours, earned my experience.
Then the private sector came calling.
But there weren't any answers there either.
They found Maria, my housekeeper, first.
I snuck into my panic room and watched them search the house for 20 minutes, and then they left.
They must have jammed my 3G radio.
I couldn't get a call out.
What kind of engineer needs a panic room?
Good question.
I'm not supposed to talk about this...
But I'm on a list.
What kind of list?
There are about 1,200 people here in the U.S.
In the event of a major catastrophe, a nuclear war, terrorism, natural disaster, those things, we all get sequestered.
If society ends, we're the ones who are responsible for rebooting it.
They're asking you to make a choice, Alan.
It's just the first of many that you'll have to make in your new position.
If you don't feel that you're ready...
- Alan, what're you doing here?

You can't just come in here without calling me first.
I... just listen to me.
You need to pack a bag and go to your mom's.
Wait, no, here we go again.

The house is mine now, Alan.
I... that's not what I mean.

What are you talking about?

Just, please, listen to me!
- I'm trying to help you!

What's going on?
I need you to take a ride with me.
- What?

- Why?

We don't have a lot of time.

What the hell are you talking about, Alan?
Okay, so look, I can only bring one person.
Please, Cynthia, just do this for me, okay?
- No, no, no.

Who are these people?

- What're you doing here?

What is go... excuse me?

- What?

- Dad, no, you...

- Dad, what's going on?

- She stays.

What is going on?
Get your hands off of me, you...
- You need to stay here.

- Just get in the car.

- Why...

I don't...
Satellite's definitely out.
You need to call your service provider.
All right.
Thank you for trying.
Sorry, I need to take this.
Yeah?
Where?
- Want another?

Copy.

Everything okay?
- Orders up in a second.

If you ever need anything...
Look me up here.
Thanks for the drinks.
Hey, hold the elevator, please.
Hey, a shitload more people have disappeared all over, so Cormier wants to see you.
- Hey.

I'm at the Yonk.

Can you pick up the kids and meet me there?
Why?

I don't know.
Something.

Okay.
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
We'll check it and be back tomorrow.

We were right in the middle of a game.
Hey, Katie.

Where are you?
Did you see "60 Minutes"?
Hundreds of toy brands made in China were found to contain BPAs.

I can help you go through Gracie's stuff.
Listen to me, Maddie.
I just got off the phone with Will.
Something's happening.
- Where?

Nice and tight.

How about you grab Rob and Hudson and come meet us?
Rob's on his way to New York.
What's going on?
I don't know, sis, but...

Oh, my God.
Is this, like, September 11th or something?
I mean, Rob's in the air.
Okay, don't panic.
Let's just be on the safe side.
I'll see you soon.
FLIGHT STATUS NOT AVAILABLE
Can we go talk outside?
Okay.
Hang tight.
We need to get outta here.
Now?
Tell me your survival instinct isn't screaming right now.
- They need us.

I can't just walk out of here.
Who's walking out on who?
See you around... partner.
Appreciate that.
I hope you have good news.
We brought in our VIP.
Which one?
Tim Lawes.

- Okay.

What the hell?
Shit.
Hold on, sweetheart.

- Are you all right?

Sorry, love.
Hey, you okay?
Come on out, sweetheart.
Grab your stuff.
Hey, listen to me.

Okay.

We're gonna go get him.
Phone's not working.
Why have all the cars stopped working?
Watch it, man.
Where is he?
Bram?
- Mom?

- Mom, I'm scared.

We're fine.

- Bram?

- Bram?

Mom?
What are you doing here?
Get your stuff.

Why?

Your father called and he asked me to pick you kids up.
Okay, hold on.
- Where are we going?

He's two miles away from here, Mom.
How are we gonna get there?
We're gonna have to figure something out.
Mom.
Mom!
Okay.

It's okay.

I'll tell you what.

How about we go to the Yonk and we meet your dad, okay?
Okay.

You come with me.
EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY
- Will.

- I couldn't get Charlie.

Every car on the road was dead and we...
- It's... it's okay.

It's okay.

How?
We got the mountain bike in the back.
- I'll take it.

I'll stay here with them.
Bram, Gracie, you do whatever your mother needs, okay?
Stay inside.
- Did you call Maddie?

- I-I told her to come down here.

They'll be here.
What happened out there?
It's some kind of EMP attack.
Anything with a circuit got shut down.
Rob was on a plane.
It's gonna be all right.
I'll see you in the morning.
Okay.

- Alan Snyder?

One of our Proxies.
Welcome.

- Nice to meet you.

I know that this is a lot to process, but you just have to tell yourself that what's happening was inevitable.
It's our job now to ensure that the transition goes as smoothly as possible.
Keep moving.

It's a brave new world, Alan, and you're about to be the most powerful man in Hollywood.
Right this way.
Move along, please.

And I need at least three more mags before...
Hey, Brou.
Wierzbowski.

What do we got?
Some foreign coalition's making a move.
They detonated an EMP in the upper atmosphere a few hours ago.
Contact from SOCOM told us to bunker down here.
The Axis powers rise again right under the nose of our entire defense and intelligence apparatus?
I'm labor, brother.

Smells like shit.
We need to get outta here.
- What?

If somebody wants to come down here looking to start some shit, they got a world of pain waiting for 'em.
Take care of yourself.
It's okay.

It's all right.
Bram.

Quick.
Katie?
Katie?
It's me!

Thank God.
Come here.

Come on in.

Hey, little man.
Come on in.
Katie, come on.
Katie, get inside!

THE SANTA MONICA BLOC
You got it right, man.
You been to that bar before.
Evening, stranger.
What can we do for you?
I'm looking for a boy.

His name's Charlie.

He's my son.
May be bigger now.

His name's Charlie.
- Charlie, huh?

Valuable.
I just wanna talk to Solomon.
Solomon is not home.
He ain't got shit.
Keep the picture.
Get the hell outta here.
- Come on.

Two minutes.
- Mom.

No contact.
Bram.
I'm so sorry, Mom.
It's okay.
Baby, are you all right?
How did you get in?
Aunt Maddie pulled some strings.
Can she get me outta here?
No, sweet boy.
What about Dad?
Your dad's at Santa Monica.
He... he went to go get Charlie.
Hey...
You stay strong.
You stay smart.
Don't move!
Easy.
Easy.
It's me.
Bowman?
I need your help.
