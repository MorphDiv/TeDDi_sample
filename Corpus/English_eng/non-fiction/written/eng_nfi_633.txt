NARRATOR:

JUGHEAD:

-Can we talk, Miss Grundy?

ARCHIE:

[GUNSHOT]
We heard what we heard, and we didn't do anything.
How would we explain why we were together at 6 a.m. on the 4th of July?
HERMIONE:

-Can I get you anything?

I can't very well have the wife of Hiram Lodge on trial for fraud and embezzlement, balancing my books.
MAN:

BETTY:

ARCHIE:

Oh, my God.

He was shot.
JUGHEAD:

That we'd come to school Monday morning, and there Jason would be.
Or that we'd see him and Cheryl in a booth at Pop's.
But that was before the undeniable, irrevocable fact of his bloated, waterlogged body.
A corpse with a bullet hole in its forehead and terrible secrets that could only be revealed by the cold steel blade of a coroner's autopsy scalpel or the telltale beating of a guilty heart.
[GUNSHOT]
[BUZZES]
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
-What are you doing?

-It was a gunshot we heard.

-Probably the shot that killed Jason Blossom.

That a gun was fired, that a boy was shot.
We don't know by whom.
We know when it was fired.

-They're performing an autopsy.

This is not a negotiation, Archie.
This is our lives.
If anybody knows that we were there, I could lose my job.
You could be expelled.
We could go to jail.
FRED:

Good boy.
ARCHIE:

Where did you sneak off to last night?
You, uh--?

Son, I've been hearing you sneak out since you were 8 years old going to Jughead's tree house.
I couldn't sleep.

All right.

Just all this stuff with Jason.
No more midnight runs until the police catch whoever it was that shot that poor kid.
I swear to God, this town....
[KNOCK ON DOOR, THEN DOOR OPENS]
HAL:

We just wanted you to know, it's gonna be a bit of a late night for us.
It's gonna be a lot of late nights for us.
I mean, an accidental drowning, who cares?
But the sociopathic son of the wealthiest family in town murdered?
That's a national obsession waiting to happen.
He's barely in his grave, Alice.
Can you warm up the car, Hal?

Betty.

It's that you always want to see the good in people.
Even people like Cheryl Blossom and Veronica Lodge and Archie Andrews.
But when they betrayed you this weekend, you saw their true colors, didn't you?
I did.

So no backsliding.
No Cheryl, no Veronica, and--
No Archie.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Walk me to school?
I needed time to process to separate what my mom wants from what I want.
-I think I want.

My mom says I should never speak to you again.
But I....
You know, even though you don't like me like that I still want us to be friends.
Best friends.
-You do?

Oh, I mean, that's great, Betty.

I'd be lying if I said that it didn't hurt.
And I'm sorry, Betty.
I didn't do it to be a--
I-- I thought it would be better in the long run--
And it will be.
Oh, and don't tell my mom that we're friends again.
Hi.
Do you think I could use Jason Blossom's death as an excuse to get out of PE?
"Sorry, coach.

Don't joke about Jason Blossom.
What?

Heh.

All right, I'm out.
BOY:

Watch it, Wednesday Addams.
Now that romance is off the table, I'll say it.

Because no straight man has that body.
Speaking of bodies, have you recovered from finding Jason's?
It was more traumatizing having to explain to my dad what I was doing with Moose at the river.

Oh, my God, those are gorgeous.
Are those for Betty, Mrs. Phillips?
That's why I called her.
"Dear Betty, please forgive me.

Who the hell is V?
-Veronica.

The yellow's for friendship.
I also had Magnolia cupcakes flown in from New York.
Because, as my mom likes to say, there's no wrong the right cupcake can't fix.
Also, I-

Blowouts too.
I am so, so sorry, Betty.
I don't know what happened to me that night.
It was such a basic-bitch move, it-- It was like I was possessed by--
Madame Satan?
The old Veronica.
And I will never, ever do anything like that to you again.
I swear on my mother's pearls.
Just-

Okay.
-What?

Awesome.
I'll take it.

-Okay.

[BELL RINGS]
Bye.
It's the path of least resistance, Kev.
A week ago, Veronica and I weren't friends.
Next week, we'll nod to each other as we pass in the hall, but that's it.
In two weeks, she won't even remember my name.
And in three, she'll have latched on to some other girl to destroy.
WEATHERBEE:

There have been many inquiries about the upcoming pep rally.
So let me state clearly it is happening as scheduled.
Now, on a less felicitous note if you could give your attention to Sheriff Keller.
Most of you already know the details but your classmate Jason Blossom's body was found late Saturday night.
So as of the weekend Jason's death is now being treated as a homicide.
It is an open and ongoing investigation.
And may I interject?
Neither I nor my parents will rest until Jason's death is avenged and his cold-hearted killer is walking the Green Mile to sit in Old Sparky and fry.
I, for one, have my suspicions.
Hashtag "Riverdale strong."
If you know anything that could help us find and apprehend Jason's killer or anything about what happened to him on July 4th I strongly urge you to come forward immediately.
You can speak with me or Principal Weatherbee.
A death like this wounds us all.
Let's not let Jason down.
JUGHEAD:

Weirdest thing.
This summer, we were supposed to go on a road trip.
Over July 4th weekend.
Which you bailed on at the last minute.
Is there something you wanna tell me, pal?
GIRL:

Back in July, you told the po-po that Jason drowned.
Yet we come to find out that Jason didn't drown.
He was shot.
Slightly suspicious, no?
Are you suggesting I had something to do with my brother's death?
GIRL:

I'll tell you what I told them, which is that Jason did fall into the water.
We both did.
I made it to the shore, he didn't.
Maybe he made it to the other side of the river and someone shot him there.

Seats, everyone.

-Can I be with Cheryl?

Oh, uh, I was thinking I'd partner with Kevin.
Actually, uh, Keller's with me.
We, like, talked.
Oh, God.
Once again, fate throws us together.
So Saturday night.
Listen, Moose, you're hot, yes, my type definitely.
But you've got more demons than The Exorcist.
We're all on the spectrum, but my gay-o-meter says you should stick with what you know best.

Cheryl, we haven't talked since the summer.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry about your brother.
Jason was the best.
If I can do anything to help.
That's sweet, Archie but unless you were at Sweetwater River and know who shot Jason....
Do, uh...?
Do you know if the police have any leads?
What?

But it's only a matter of time.
And my twintuition is telling me it's someone we all know.
Right.

Weird why?
Oh.
You mean because my brother is being dissected with a blade just like this one?
Possibly at this very moment?
Don't worry, I'm fine.
In fact...
[GASPS] ...I'm amazing.
MAN:

Step closer to the body.
There are several morbid details you should find relevant to your article.
What details, Dr. Curdle?
What sticks out to you?
Marbling of the veins, signs of scavenger activity.
Ligature marks on both wrists and a hint of cryonecrotic preservation.
Small bills, right?
So, what did Moose want?
Oh, my God.

I mean, I am devastatingly handsome in that classic pre-accident Montgomery Clift kind of way.
And sexuality is fluid but can someone named "Moose" actually be that fluid?
Okay, well, I ship it.
Well, of course you would.

I just meant that Moose has an official girlfriend.

Anyway, it's terrible to say but part of me wishes he would just stay in the darn closet.
Obviously, I didn't mean literal closet.
Archie.
Any new material you wanna try out on a very forgiving audience?
-I....

Would you?
I'd love to hear it.
I'm still working on the lyrics, so....
Okay.
[SINGING] Come on, turn the radio on
And, honey, we'll dance
Dance, dance
For the rest of the night I'm not ready....
[KEVIN VERONICA APPLAUD]
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Betty?
You okay?
I'm supposed to say "yes."
That's what the nice girl always says, but....
No, I'm not.

I thought I could be, but it's too much, too fast.

ARCHIE:

Betty, wait.
Betty, wait.
-Come on, listen to me.

No.

-Me too.

I thought I could pretend this weekend didn't happen, but....
I can't give you the answer you want.

-...and that's how I feel right now.

WEATHERBEE:

If we could have a word in private.
You're in a very good place right now, Mr. Andrews.
Varsity football, AP music tutorials.
This morning in the hallway, you wouldn't meet my eyes.

-I was distracted.

Weatherbee just asked me if I knew anything about Jason.
And?

Nothing.

He said if I did, I shouldn't be scared and he'd make sure I was okay.
Of course he would.

Is this--?
How you feel about me....
Is it real?
Because if it's not, then I don't know what I'm protecting.
It is.
It is real.
Maybe it's not right but it's real.
Which is why we--
You can't go to Weatherbee.
If you do that we will never see each other again.
Archie, I'm putting myself in your hands.
Stand down, Vixens, and listen up.
The weather's predicting a downpour the night of the rally but already, you're raining on my parade.
With Jason so present in our collective consciousness all eyes will be on me.
"Will this beautiful, exotic hothouse flower drown under the town's scrutiny or be swamped by her emotions?"
The answer, ladies, is no and no.
That said, I need star power.
I need the Pussycats.
Stay loose and limber, ladies, while I make a call.
After this practice, I'll totally need a pedicure.

I'll have homework.
I know everyone grieves differently but Cheryl's hosting a pep rally to cope with her loss.
That's either brilliant or psychotic or both.
Yeah, well, at least Cheryl's not putting on an act pretending she's a butterfly when she's really a wasp.
For the record, the only reason I went into that closet with Archie was so that Cheryl wouldn't.
-Oh, so you did it to protect me?

Okay, so nothing happened between you and Archie in the closet, then?
Yeah, that's what I thought.

If by "fine," you mean he was oblivious and you were pining after him in quiet desperation.
We were friends, at least.
You were walking on eggshells, scared to tell the truth.
-Okay, you don't know me, Veronica.

If that's what you're thinking.

It's not even stupid Archie's.

Most of the time, the people we like don't like us back.
Romeo and Juliet are the exception, not the rule.
Look, never speak to me again.

But what exactly did Archie do wrong?
-Are you taking his side?

-This is your way of trying to be friends again?

Sorry, am I interrupting?
-As a matter of fact--

I have a gift certificate for hers-and-hers mani-pedis and blowouts at Chez Salon.
-You wanna come with me?

Butt out, Closet Monster.

As pour moi, Betty, but of course.
I never say no to a pedi.
And I was just about to suggest the same thing.
Can I steal her for a second?
You're doing great, Mom.
Better than me this week.
Yeah, we're surviving, Ronnie, by our wits because that's what we Lodge women do.
If your dad could see us now....
He'd say you look stunning in that new uniform.
I'm going for this Joan Crawford-Mildred Pierce thing.
-Is it working?

-Hi.

And who might this heartbreaker be?
I'm picking up an order for Andrews.
Oh, you're Fred's son.
You're as handsome as your father was.
VERONICA:

Wait.

Is, uh, Betty still mad at you?
We're back to no texting.

I'm back to being the shallow, toxic rich bitch who ruins everything in her path.
Which is unfortunate because even though I only just met Betty it felt like we were meant to be best friends.
Like-

And now....
It's like there was this train that was heading to the rest of my life and I just missed it.
Betty and I have been next-door neighbors since we were 4.
We've always gone to the same school, been in the same class.
I remember in the second grade, I was having trouble reading.
My teacher, Mrs. Gribrock, told my mom and dad that I should stay back a year to get caught up.
Betty was so against us not being in the same grade that she took it upon herself to tutor me every single day.
-In the second grade?

Anyway, when I passed, thanks to Betty I kissed her and I asked her to marry me.
She was like, "Oh, little Archie, we're too young.
Ask me when we're 18 and I'll say yes."
Wow.
I hate that I hurt her.
Give her time, Archie.

And don't despair.

[POP MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS]
Your room's so sweet.
It's too pink.

No, I like how girly it is.
Mine is too.
You should come over and see it sometime.

I mean, she must be evil incarnate if even you won't have her as a friend.
And on the subject of friends Betty, I'm sorry I've been such a witchy witch to you.
After Polly and Jason's epic demise, I was angry at everyone.
But I took it out on you, which was super unfair.
Especially, since, in a way, it's kind of like we both lost siblings.
How--?

Still in that group home?
You think she knows what happened to Jason?

I--

-I don't know.

About Jason and Polly?
Not a lot.
Same.

Why are you asking me so many questions about Polly?
Cheryl?
Because, you dumb cow, someone shot my brother and I think it was your crazy, tweaked-out sister.
Get out of my house.
-Not until you tell me--

Jug?

What's up is I saw you, Archie.
-In the music room.

I'm trying to help you, dude.
I'm trying to be your friend here, even though we're not anymore.
How long?
You and Grundy?
Since the summer.
I like her.
So I'm guessing she's the reason you've been acting weird since summer?
-One of them.

There's more?
We were at Sweetwater River on July 4th.
We heard a gunshot.

-Dude, you have to tell somebody--

Neither can you.

A kid is dead, Archie and you're worried about some-- Some cougar.
Don't call her that, okay?

Stab in the dark, I'm guessing she cares more about herself.
She's the one who's telling you not to say anything, right?
Look, I saw you guys.
She's messing with you, man.

What the hell do you know about it, Jughead?

Nothing.
But I used to know this guy once, Archie Andrews.
He wasn't perfect but he always tried to do the right thing, at least.
Jug.
If you tell anyone about this....
What?
What are you gonna do?
[DOOR OPENS]
Hey, Jug.
You coming in?

He was just leaving.
A little sage to banish the evil spirits.
Mom.
I'm not joking, Betty.
That family is pure evil.
I'm wondering if the Blossoms didn't kill Jason themselves sacrificed him to some dark pagan god that they worship...
-...in that insane mansion of theirs.

I told her.

Mom, why were you so against them being together?
Many reasons.
That family, everything they touch, it rots.
Mom, I was thinking maybe it's time I go visit Polly.
I am so proud of how you stood up to that dragoness.
But honestly, Betty, why was Cheryl over here in the first place?
And who else is gonna come waltzing in?

How many times are you gonna let them hurt you?
Until I learn my lesson, Mom.
You were right.
And what you said about Archie....
Sometimes it's hard to admit things to yourself.
My mother is crazy.
I'm afraid I'll never see my sister again.
The boy I like doesn't like me back.
He may not be crushing on you, but he does love you.
And he's legit miserable without you, if it's any consolation.
My mom says sometimes a friend is better than a boyfriend.
Maybe this is one of those times.
REGGIE:

Mantle the Magnificent.
Because I'd want Blossom dead.
When he was the only good quarterback we had.
Speaking of offensive tight ends, I should've sent the cops to you, Moose.
Because here's another unsolved mystery.

Or does being with the sheriff's son give you a free pass, Keller?
-Reggie's just being a blowhard, Kev.

I mean, let's think about it.
If a kid at Riverdale killed Jason, it's not gonna be a jock, right?
No, let's be honest.
Isn't it always some spooky, scrawny, pathetic Internet troll too busy writing manifestos to get laid?
Some smug, moody, serial-killer-fanboy freak.
Like Jughead.
What was it like, Suicide Squad?
When you shot Jason?
You didn't do stuff to the body, did you?
Like, after?
It's called necrophilia, Reggie.

You little--
Hey, shut the hell up, Reggie.
Boys.
-What do you care, Andrews?

Holy crap.
Did you and Donnie Darko kill him together?
Was it some sort of pervy blood-brother thing?
Hey!
FRED:

I hate to ask this, but did you get that in a fight with Jughead?
No.

It's a long story.
Jughead and I, we were disagreeing about a girl.
Huh.
-Because there's this girl--

But it's not about me and Jughead.

I think we should do something and it's the right thing, Dad.
But the girl says that if we do or if I do this thing it'll ruin what we have.
That doesn't make any sense, does it?
You know, this is the most honest talk we've had in a while.
And I'm glad that you wanna do the right thing.
I can see that, even under the shiner.
Archie, if know it's the right thing to do even though it's tough, even though it might--
It might cost you you gotta do it.
[MARCHING BAND PLAYING AND ALL CHEERING]
I'm gonna come clean with Weatherbee and Keller.
I was there.

Archie, slow down.
I'm gonna do it tomorrow.
If you wanna come with me, then we can figure that out.

I'm sorry, Miss Grundy, but I have to.
JUGHEAD:

You?
Grundy and me.

Or, at least, I am.
And also, I didn't mean all that crap I said to you.
I'm sorry.
It's cool.
We're not gonna hug in front of this whole town.
So why don't we both just do that bro thing where we nod like douches and mutually suppress our emotions?
Yeah.

To be discussed over many burgers and many days.
Oh, my God, Arch, your eye.
WEATHERBEE:

Thank you, Principal Weatherbee.
It is heartening to see so many of you here, even in weather like this.
But a lack of heart and school spirit has never been the Riverdale way.
Tonight's pep rally isn't like any other we've had in the past.
And we shouldn't pretend that it is.
Which is why I would like to dedicate this evening to the memory of one of our brightest.
Jason Blossom.
We're with him tonight.
Now, please, join me in welcoming to the field our very own River Vixens and their special guest stars, my daughter, Josie, and her Pussycats!
[SINGING] Hey, shorty You're my candy girl
The kind with the swirls Oh, so good
Baby, out of this world
Look so sweet Fell in love with your curves
Every time you speak Conversation like syrup
S-U-G-A-R You and her
Oh, honey, honey Put money on that first
Let's keep it in the circle You everything I deserve
Baby, want your sugar I'm ready to get served
Sugar
Oh, honey, honey
You are my candy girl
And you got me wanting you
I saw this girl I wanted to know her name
She gots this body It's driving me insane
'Cause I need candy, girl
Your kisses rock my world
More legs, brown eyes
And your body look fancy, girl
Sugar
Oh, honey, honey
You are my candy girl
And you got me wanting you
All right, you all ready?

Put your hands together for the Riverdale Bulldogs!
[SOBBING]
Cheryl?
Cheryl, what is it?
What happened?
Jason.
He's gone.
I know.
I know he is.
No, you don't.

He was supposed to come back.
[MOUTHS] He was supposed to come back?
I'm alone.
I'm alone.
You're not alone.
It's okay.
Hey.
Hey.
I saw you and Cheryl.
Not many girls would've done what you did.
Full disclosure, I've had my share of emotional breakdowns.
If you're not doing anything do you wanna go get a milkshake at Pop's?
-Are you sure?

Betty, I'd love that.
MAN:

One double-chocolate and one old-fashioned vanilla.
-Thank you.

Betty can we make a vow?
-Sure.

Deal?
Deal.
[DOOR OPENS AND BELL JINGLES]
Do you guys want to join us?
Yes, but only if you're treating.
[BOTH LAUGH]
VERONICA:

Jughead Jones III.
JUGHEAD:

But I was there.

A blond girl a raven-haired girl and the luckiest redheaded boy in the universe.
For one shining moment, we were just kids those bright neon lights of Pop's keeping the darkness at bay giving way, as all nights must to a morning of reckoning.
We'll be reviewing these systems of human biology, starting with....
You're here for me, aren't you?
Because of the autopsy?
We don't need to do this in front of your classmates, Cheryl.
It's all right, Principal Weatherbee.
They'll find out soon enough.
-Now, that won't be necessary.

Find out what?
That I'm guilty.
JUGHEAD:

That Jason didn't die on July 4th, as we believed but over a week later.
