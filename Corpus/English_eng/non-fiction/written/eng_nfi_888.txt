Previously on The White Princess...
Now that you have Arthur, you are joined with us.
And any threat against Henry is a threat against our boy as well.
Don't be fooled by her.
She's formidable and quite the politician.
The King would have peace with Burgundy.
Where is my mother?
My mother proved she was behind the Lovell plot to kill me.
She wanted Teddy on the throne...
If my mother brings an army, how can I choose between my mother and my son?
Perhaps a York and Tudor union might grow to be a fashion.
Oh!

If it makes you feel better, we will have one race.
I assume she is an expert rider.
Never beaten.
Mary?
I am sorry for your loss.

It's been two days.
Will you not have something small to eat?
My poor girl.
Come now.
Or those children will have no one.
Their father is too deep in grief to notice them.
Grand-mere?
We eat and then we plan.
The Tudors take from us the people we love.
They disturb our peace and now we will disturb theirs.
Elizabeth will have her war.
Allow me.
Here...
Your uncle is returned from Burgundy.
Quickly now.
That doesn't annoy you?
Just a door between your room and hers?
Something's wrong.
Look, how could it have gone so wrong?
When the girl died...

Our aunt's step-daughter Mary.
It was an accident.
Yet, they blamed us.
Why, if you were not to blame?
There was a competition which...
It was the girl's own fault.
She...

If you hadn't been so wrapped up in the Duchess, then it might have been avoided.
"Wrapped up?"
He was "attentive" to her.
We should maintain the course that we are on.
My Lady The King's Mother is already making matches for the York girls with the Tudor nobles.
So they may not be snatched from us and used to breed York heirs.
We do not know what the Duchess will do.
She may do nothing.
We should be ready but not think the worst.
Margaret?
You're angry with me.
As I am with myself.
We were so close...
I do not wish to hear how close you were!
So close to peace.
What was it you thought I meant?
She is a York!
Of all things.
How could you even think to...
Lizzie?
I heard about the accident.
I am sorry for our aunt...
Could this not be good?
For Teddy?
If the Duchess turns against the Tudors, perhaps she'll send some men to rescue him...
It is bad, Maggie.
Henry is more fearful than before.
The threat against the Tudors means my sisters must now also be locked away in marriages.
We must all be turned to Tudors.
Me as well?
You are another York princess whose children could be heirs.
Well, who will I be wed to?

Will I live near Westminster?
You'll not make me go away from Teddy?
I have told Henry I shall influence the matches.
His mother will not be let loose to match you all with beasts or peasants.
I will make a stand against his mother.
I will do my best for you.
Thank you for coming.
I am sorry for your loss.
You have the English boys?
I do.
Go on, lad.
Just as we practiced.
My name is Teddy, Your Grace.
It is an honor to meet you, Your Grace.
This one looks most like Teddy.
No one outside of England knows what Teddy looks like.
They'll accept whoever's by my side.
This boy has an innocent face, but he's determined.
He won't shy away.
To whom does he belong?
"To my sister-in-law, Elizabeth.
"I can only beg forgiveness that I haven't written sooner.
"My shock at Mary's passing has left me too bereft.
Inside then, girls.
"I've learned that you are now
"a prisoner in Bermondsey Abbey
"and have no means to write.
"But I still have my friends in England
"and have made arrangements for ink and paper
"to be brought to you.
Lady Mother?
"You will need to write to Ireland."
Lizzie, look.
This is me, the Queen, with my intended, John Welles.
The pawns are our sisters and this is our cousin Maggie.
And this is baby Arthur.
Arthur is too young to be betrothed.
But the King has said that he will win for him the hand of the Spanish princess, Catherine of Aragon.
Best ally to guard against your aunt.
We may discuss it but we will not bind him to it.
I will choose Maggie's husband.
It is decided.
Not by me and I am Queen.
And I shall take the Queen's rooms now.
She is to marry Henry's loyal commander, Richard Pole.
The family have been notified.
Pole is beneath her.
And you will move out today.
They say he is a vicious brute who lost his arm and half the fingers on his hand but still fought on!
The King has blessed the marriage and it is settled.
As am I, in rooms the King gave me himself.
Jasper Tudor needs a wife.
My mother's sister Kate is wealthy from her late husband and will bring funds to Henry's cause.
I will suggest it.
Henry, your mother must be removed from the Queen's rooms now.
Oh, forget the rooms.
They're saying your cousin has escaped from the Tower.
What?
Take me home.
I don't understand.
Why would people say he is free if he is not?
It will be Burgundy stirring up unrest.
But what unrest?
How does it help them to say that he is free?
They are claiming that they have him there.
Using his name to raise an army against me.
No.
Teddy could never...
Maybe not.

And he is a York heir.
Lizzie, please.
Help him.
If Burgundy is behind this, then prove that they are wrong.
Cecily will be married soon.
Let us have Teddy at the wedding.
If we show that he is living with us, a valued member of our household, then he cannot be in Burgundy raising men against you.
All those who say he is will be proven liars.
And I suppose that after the wedding you will say that we must keep him from the Tower and with us?
Well, if it goes well, why not?
He is just a child, Henry.
You have seen how scared he is, how lonely and unloved.
Can you say you have never felt that?
You are better than this.
Don't be so threatened by a child...
Show the world the man you are and let him live with us again.
Thank you, Henry.
Do I look beautiful?
I must look beautiful.
Lizzie, are you happy for me?
You and I will walk behind Lizzie and the King.
Outside?
Yes, Teddy.

But it's very important that we're good and do not make a sound.
Do you understand?
It is preposterous.
To counter that the boy is free, he frees him.
It is madness!
It is the Queen's madness.
Enough!
It is enough.
Bishop Morton?
My Lady The King's Mother.
You have someone in the crowd?
The boy will soon be thrown back into the Tower.
- God save the King!

"Hooray for King Henry!"
"God bless you sire."
- Princess Cecily!

Princess Cecily!
King Warwick, we support you!
Warwick!

Shh!

What's the boy saying?

King Warwick!
Guards, get the boy.
No.

Get back!
Keep away from him.
You will not harm him!
York is the true king!
De la Pole!
York!
York!
Traitor!
No!

Take him down.
Where are you taking him?
It's not his fault!
It's supposed to be my wedding day!
Grab the child.

You're safe.
One voice.
That's all it took.

John De la Pole.
Just one, not all of your men.
The other De la Poles have fled.
Who else is against me?
It's a pox that spreads like a plague and whispers in men's ears, "Rise up!
"For no one loves the King!
"Rise up and spread this poison."
This has done me harm.
And it was your idea.
You cannot think that I wanted this.
All I wanted was my cousin from the Tower and now he is back inside.
It is neither his fault nor mine.
It is Elizabeth, your mother's.
What?
She must have instructed De la Pole to snatch the boy to hand to Burgundy.
My mother is in Bermondsey and she is watched night and day.
The woman who set off the crowd was paid to do it.
You must have seen it, Henry.
She did her job and she fled.
Elizabeth will strike again.
There is only one way to ensure she doesn't...
What?
What way?
Silence her forever, Henry, and Burgundy will lose their agent and their links to all your enemies.
Cut off the head and the snake will die.
Henry?
No, she is my mother.
She is our son's grandmother!
All of England laughs behind my back.
I am a fool to them, that has no love from any man.
Do you not think that I would kill for that?
I would kill for less than that.
Please tell Henry it wasn't Teddy's fault.
He didn't mean it.
He always says that when someone calls out to him.
Lizzie?

Well, then will you try to help him?
The best thing you can do is be obedient to your marriage plans.
And pray for patience.
Do you know now?
Who he is?
He is a soldier.
He is not a man I have met.
He lives in Wales.
You did not make the choice then?
Lady Margaret did.
More wine for my ladies.
It is a wedding after all and we shall celebrate.
You are recovered from them?
The King tells me the Queen would have me wed.
She wishes to draw attention from her own sister.
If it would benefit the King then...
I will do whatever is asked of me, but if not, then...
I would sooner...
Have my leave to stay at court.
At court?
I would like us to speak plainly, Margaret.
Dance, wife?
The Flemish troops are paid for and in place.
They ready the fleet as we speak.
And the Irish?

Did Elizabeth's letter do its work?
It did.
Kildare and others pledge their armies.
Lambert!
No!
Why do you look at me?
- You said...

Who is "Lambert?"
You are Edward, Earl of Warwick.
What name do you answer to, Edward?
Why so much time on the sword?
Surely comportment lessons would serve him better.
He must have the rudiments of defense or he won't last in battle.
Battle?
She's not sending him into battle, he's all of 10 years old.
She'll set him on a horse and he'll rouse the men and that'll be the end of it.
My Lady, the boy is of little use unless he leads the army into England.
If you are nervous, you give your opponent signs.
He will take advantage.
No matter what you feel inside, you must always show a brave face to the world.
You must not show fear.
Do you understand?
Good.
Now tell me your name.
Teddy.
And what makes you special, Teddy?
I am the rightful King of England.
Now show me what you can do with that sword.
"And I send you my most heartfelt thanks.
"For coming to our aid."
It's Lizzie!
Lizzie!
Lizzie!
Lizzie!
I'm sorry that I didn't come sooner.
But you're here now.
How's Arthur?
He is well.
I would have brought him but...
Henry doesn't know you're here?
No.
Look at you, Anne!
How much you've grown.
I swear you're almost as tall as me.
How did you get in?
The monks.
They let you through?
I am Queen now, I command them.
Well, tell me everything.
Are you well?
What news from Burgundy?

I hoped that you would tell me.
You write to her.

I can get nothing in or out.
For the first time in my life,
I am bereft of letters and of news.
Tell me, please.
What of the Tudor court?
Your marriage.
Would you still push him from the throne?
You are truly not in touch with anyone?
Even the boy who used to take my messages for me has gone away.
Margaret is convinced you are the cause of Henry's troubles.
She would have you dead.
Of course she would.
No, Mother, this is not an idle threat.
This time he means it.
He believes you planned for Teddy to be snatched and used against us.
I know nothing of it.
If I knew what my aunt had planned, then maybe I could talk him round.
If you know anything, please, help me.
I have no power anymore.
I have these four walls and your sisters, and that is all.
Henry...

I was just...

I have you followed.
And I am proven right too because you went to see your mother.
Did you really think you could just slip into the abbey where I keep her if I did not permit it?
You lied to me and you are as treacherous as she is.
Henry.
Henry.
I went to see my mother, yes.
Because you said you would execute her.
I went behind your back, but it was to help us.
To see if she is plotting with Burgundy.
And is she?
I don't know.
Because she told me nothing.
Because my mother no longer trusts me.
She saw before I did myself that I am Tudor now.
The birth of Arthur makes me so whether I like it or not because I will never stand against him.
Our son puts me on your side forever.
You may disbelieve it if you choose... but you are all I have now.
Our family is all I have and...
If you don't trust me...
I want to go home.

You're not going home.
You're going to war.
It isn't even rough.
There's barely any heave at all!
How do you intend to protect him in battle?
Lovell and De la Pole will be there with him.
Have a care.
He's just a child.
He's a child that will bring down the Tudor King.
Or is that not what you wanted?
I will not be witness to this battle.
When you sail to England, I will return to Burgundy.
They have arrived in Ireland with a fleet of ships and 2,000 Flemish mercenaries.
The Irish have welcomed them with open arms and they are preparing to invade.
I must fight to save my crown against a peasant boy.
When do you ride out?
Dawn.
My Lady, Margaret.
Will you walk with me?
Of course.
What I, um, tried to say to you before was that what I found in Burgundy was...
Please, Jasper...
Was nothing more than the truth about myself.
My life has been a full one, Margaret, but it has been lonely.
You wish to marry.
I...

Well, I would.
If circumstances allowed.
You told me once that your marriage to Lord Stanley was for us to put our boy upon the throne.
That's right.

Then the Church permits annulments, does it not?
If the marriage isn't...
I...

Your faith, it is the essence of you.
So, if I speak out of turn, then you must tell me.
We have lived our lives for Henry.
And I do not regret a moment of it.
But now, in twilight years...
Might we not venture to cherish something for ourselves?
Will you think on it while I am gone?
That's all I ask.
I thought you would like to say goodbye to him.
There's something that I wish to ask you.
Do not fight.
You would have me stay here?
Let them storm the gate?
Of course not.
Lead your men onto the field but do not risk your own life.
Do not fight in person.
If I died, you would be rid of me.
Your mother safe, your cousin free to take the throne.
How can I prove to you that I am with you, except to ask you not to die?
While you are on the field and I am at Maggie's wedding...
Take this with you.
Promise me you will not fight.
Come home.
So we can start our life together.
Charge!
You go ahead.
Could you take him?
Of course.
Thank you.
"My dearest Lizzie.
"Yes, I have the means to write
"and I know how that will hurt you."
She is writing letters.
Who is writing letters?
Our mother.
Of course she is.
Lady Margaret said it was her that funded the York army.
"But, there's something I must tell you,
"as painful as it is.
"When you were first with child, with Arthur,
"I knew then that he'd never be the king.
"I don't know where my sight comes from,
"but I could see it.
"Curse me if you will.
"And hold your boy close,
"but Lizzie, you must change allegiance
"and back your brother's claim for England.
"I know he will return to us."
What does she say?
She is ill-wishing Arthur.
She says he will not be king.

Don't listen to her, Lizzie.
She is only on her own side.

She will say whichever words best serve her own cause.
Whether they're true or not.
Now, we must go and help Maggie with her marriage bed.
She has no mother either.
Lizzie?
Will it hurt?
A little bit.
But then it feels quite nice.
My Lady Margaret.
Sir Richard.
An injury from Bosworth.
It is a source of guilt to me that I can no longer fight in battle.
And a torment when the weather turns.
My heart was beating through my chest inside the chapel.

I do not like to be, uh, the center of attention.
Nor I.
Margaret.
I know I am beneath you but I will try to be a husband who's worthy of your name.
I do not want my name.
Plantagenet is hateful to me.
All it means is danger and a broken heart.
Your brother, Edward...
Must I live away from him?
I cannot bear to.
Then we will often be in London.
You only have to ask for what will make you happy.
Oh, thank you.
Maggie Pole.
Everyone calls me Maggie.
You confuse me.
I know that you love Henry, and love God, and yet there is so much hate in you.
It is a shame you didn't marry Jasper.
Perhaps that is your tragedy.
My husband is Sir Thomas Stanley!
But Jasper is the man you love.
Can you deny it?
I have no tragedy.
How dare you say such things to me?
You paint me with your own sinful desires.
Leave me.
Lizzie!
I have a message from my husband.
We have won.
Mother lost again.
My husband says the King has granted us permission to leave court.
We shall go and live at his castle in the north.
I hope you will be happy.
I think I will be happier than you.
But you must come and visit us.
Goodbye, Lizzie.
Goodbye.
Henry!
His name is Lambert Simnel.
Routing his army has caused grave injury to my uncle.
The traitor will be dealt with.
There is another traitor in an abbey to attend to.
They both should pay the same price for their treason.
Lizzie?
My Lady Margaret.
For the first time since I won at Bosworth we have engaged in battle.
And we slaughtered them.
You slaughtered them.
My loyal, true and trusted men.
I have my throne because of you, and I am grateful.
You will be rewarded.
But first, we must attend to our two traitors.
The boy who led the army.
And the York woman who has plotted against me since I won the crown.
Traitor!
The penalty for treason is death.
So...
Who would have me kill them?
And who would not?
I would not, Your Grace.
The boy is just a boy.
A pawn for an adult game that he doesn't understand.
And Dowager Queen Elizabeth?
The mother of the Queen?
She has no excuse.
She rallied the Irish.

And yet, here I am.

Their army barely drew their swords.
You cut through them like barley.
Please, Your Grace.
The boy will be given a job in the palace kitchens.
He will turn the spit.
And be thankful that he has no need to return to a father who would sell him for a keg of ale.

And you,
may tell your mother, when next you visit her,
that the King is in rude health, and sends his regards!
Thank you, Henry.
Thank you.
Jasper.
I feared you were avoiding me.
I have found a wife for you.
Kate Woodville.
The Dowager Queen's sister.
The King has given his blessing to the marriage.
Her fortune is significant.
It will benefit the Tudor cause.
I see.
We will see each other at the Privy Council.
And work for Henry's cause.
As we have always done.
Come.
I have something for you.
I had my mother leave.
You are the Queen.
They are your rooms.
I kept my promise, and now you will keep yours.
We will be happy.
You know she won't give up, don't you?
My mother.

And look at us...
We are still here.
We have a guest.
He arrived just before you did.
Richard?
Is it really you?
Oh.
Our lost York Prince, Richard...
Is safe!
