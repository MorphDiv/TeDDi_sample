(INTRO TO WOMAN BY WOLFMOTHER PLAYING)
Woman, you know you're a woman
You got to be...
- There she is.

JESS:

You go, baby girl.

- (CHEERING)

- You're my baby...

JESS:

- Oh!

Oh...

- (GAGS) Nope.

- I absolutely can't do it.

But remember, this is a stupid frat boy ritual, so...
Yeah, but kick their ass!

- Yeah, fuck 'em up!

- We're together.

Cool, cool, cool.
- (CHEERING, GROANING)

- (SCREAMING, WHOOPING)

- Dude!

Oh, God.

Only two cups left.
No, there's one cup.

Oh, God!

- Oh, I can't do it.

- I can't do it, Jess.

- Look at me.

You got us through the Wendy's drive-through when my car had no windshield and three tires.
(WHISPERS) You can do anything.
(WHISPERING) Yeah, but everybody's watching me, and I'm sweating like crazy.
I look like a princess, but I smell like a peasant.
Let's go, foot job girl!
Excuse me, she has a name!

And she's my best friend, and she's good and kind.
BOTH:

Thank you, but I did jerk off his roommate with my feet.
I...

The key is, right foot only for, like, a while.
- You know?

If we win this, we will be the only girls to ever win the Halloween tournament.
(WHISPERS) We've got to do this.
For womankind.
Stop making me horny, and shoot!
MAN: (RAPPING) Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy... (DISTORTED WHOOSHING)
(CHEERING)
ALICE AND JESS:

- I want up!

You've earned it.
(WHOOPING, CHEERING)
Here we go.

I'm the king of the world!
(THUMP)
ALL:

BLAIR:

FRANKIE:

WOMAN:

- Oh, my God, are you okay?

- I'm fine, Mom.

What happened?
Honestly, I don't even know why we go to these stupid parties.
I just want to hang out with you guys.
- I know.

Everyone else at this college is sloppy and gross.
- BLAIR:

Oh.
- Ugh!

- ALICE:

What is that?
- What is that?

Oh, it's my vibrator, it randomly turns on and off.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Oh, my God, you guys, I'm gonna miss you so much next semester.
- I don't want to talk about it.

- No, no, no, no.

Al Gore is guest-lecturing next semester.
Maybe you don't want to go to Australia.

- Yeah.

I said I don't want to talk about it.
So I don't know what's happening.
I don't even want to go.

It was so hard to get into the political science program.
And plus, my gym class is bungee jumping, so...
Oh, my God, wear a good bra.
Well, look, we'll have all of senior year together, and then we'll have the rest of our lives together, so it's fine.
- BLAIR:

You guys, our kids are gonna play together.
- FRANKIE:

- We're so lucky!

- Oh.

- FRANKIE:

Just...

BLAIR:

- No!

- Come on.

Oh, my God!

- Bathroom is next-door!

- Every damn weekend with this!

ALICE:

MAN: (SINGING) Whoo!
What!

(MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING)
Hi.

Crime, underfunded schools, sewage.
These are real problems that our community is facing.
Looking forward to your vote on November 3.
Thank you.
- It's great.

What?

Don't know, but 6Ø% is, like, a lot.
- Yeah.

I don't understand, Wesson literally tweeted out a dick pic.
He apologized.
Yes.

- and then he tweeted out another one.

Look, if Wesson wins, he's literally gonna cut every single program that actually helps people.
We know that.

But people want to vote for someone they can relate to.
They feel safe with Wesson.
They want to have a beer with him.
I'm not sure anyone wants to have a beer with that.
(GROANS)
- (RINGTONE PLAYING)

Hey, Alice.
Hey.

I got my IUD taken out for Miami.
Um, is that a good idea?
Uh, yeah.

Jess, Wesson tweeted out another dick pic, and it's already got 10,0ØØ retweets.
Alice, I...

(BEEP)
Tulum, give her back her Kindle!
Every fuckin' day.
♪♪
- Hey.

I'm so sorry.

It's okay.
BOTH:

- I got you chicken cashew nut, extra nut.

I ate an apple and a bag of very, very stale pretzels at the office.
It was so hard to get extra nut.
That woman is so mean.

She thought I hung up, but I heard her call me a dipshit.
- How much did you tip?

- I know.

- You're just such a good person.

Oh, it's Alice.

- It's okay, get it.

- Enough with my bachelorette itinerary.

- Like, she's planned it to the half hour.

Yeah, I feel like this weekend has come at the worst possible time.
I'm so stressed out.
You'll see your friends, you'll have fun.
It'll be restorative.
Like that time we took Xanax and slept for 16 hours.
Oh, God, that was good.
(SIGHS) You know, I love those girls, but I really just don't want to have a party weekend right now.
- Mmm-hmm.

- I miss you.

- You've been at the office, like, nonstop.

Mmm.
Mmm.

Wait, wait, one...

I'm gonna want to have sex.
I'm okay with that.
- I'm down.

But I have, like, four things I have to do before.
I just have to print out those itineraries for the city council meeting.
And I have to email the Herald.
I have, like, a 25-minute-ish interview.
- Ooh.

I tell you what, I'm gonna let you do all that, and I'm gonna go masturbate in the shower and go to sleep.
- Really?

- You're the best.

- I love you.

JESS:

Shots, shots, shots, shots!

- Shots, shots, shots!

- ALICE:

Oh, my God.
- What's on my head?

Your bachelorette weekend.
I have been waiting for this moment since the first day of freshman year.
- Get in here.

Oh, my God, there's gonna be so many hot Miami babes.
We are gonna be swimmin' in dick, girl!
Hi, Alice.
- Peter.

And get out of here, she's mine now.
Don't get in too much trouble, okay?
- Yeah, I won't.

Drive safe.

Will do.
Hey, Alice, be careful swimming in all that dick.
ALICE:

I'm so happy to see you.
Oh, this weekend's gonna be so much fun.
Can't wait to see my girls!
When the pepper spray hits your face, and it will, keep your mouth closed tight.
- We are peaceful protestors.

Yet we fight, you know?

- Yeah!

- (ALARM BEEPING)

But if anybody from the group disappears from the protest, you text my cell phone immediately.
You have a cell phone?
- Uh, no.

(FRANKIE GROANS)
I'll pick you up after school on Monday, okay, sweetie?
Mommy, do you have to go to Miami?
Yes, I really do.
But I'm gonna miss you so much.
Technically, my time started 2Ø minutes ago, so, going to note this for the custody hearing.
Mmm.

Bye.
♪♪
Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer... ♪♪
Well, well, well.
Damn.
Damn.
How do you do it?
How do you look this flawless getting off a plane?
It's honestly rude.
What, are you flirting with me?
I would not flirt with a happily married woman who broke my heart.
Oh, my God, you broke up with me, don't even start with that.
Excuse me, now you are flirting with me, okay?
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you, too.
Girl, I have had a day.
First was full, I had to ride business.

(LAUGHS)
- Gross.

Oh, my God, did you hear Alice is making us go to a foam party?
Ugh!

She has a scary amount of time on her hands.
Even though she's a full-time teacher, I'm still like, "Get a job."
Do you have a job?
Activism is a full-time job, but...
- Also no.

Look at them, the magic is still there.
- Hello!

- Hi!

(SHOUTS, LAUGHTER)
- Oh, my God!

Mmm!

- I have, like, half a pound of weed in my bra.

- Hey, Alice, how's your mom?

Good.
The Wallace 5th Floor Girls are back together again!
(WHOOPING, LAUGHING)
God, when was the last time we were all together?
I think it was two summers ago when we came to visit you in your tree, right?
No, no, no, 'cause Jess couldn't make it, it was, uh,
New Year's Eve, when Blair was in labor.
- Oh, my God.

Yeah.

- Yes!

- The party starts now.

(PANICKED SHOUTS, SCREAMS)
Oh, my God.

- Yeah, we're in an airport.

- That sounded like a gunshot.

- Let's go.

BLAIR:

ALICE:

FRANKIE:

We are supposed to pick up the keys from the neighbors.
ALICE:

JESS:

Hi.
Sorry, somebody left some keys for...
- Oh, my goodness.

- So sorry.

No, no, I'm sorry.
Let me put something on.
FRANKIE:

- LEA:

- Is it really?

- Hello.

- Thank you.

Okay.
What brings you to Miami?
Business?

The business of pleasure?
Oh, bachelorette weekend.
- Jess is getting married.

- Congratulations!

This marriage, will it be open?
You know, we haven't discussed it.
But, probably closed.

Tightly, tightly closed.
Lea, does she not remind you of our French girl from Turks and Caicos?
- Oh.

Thank you.

Well, we're gonna try to keep it down.
- BLAIR:

- ALICE:

Ah!

- They're serious.

She is delicious.
- I want that.

(WOMEN LAUGHING)
Ooh, yes.
Oh, Real World, baby!

Ew.

I'm gonna go take a protest dump.
I call the room next to Jess!

Oh, I think that room has bunk beds, so you're gonna have to share with Pippa.
Uh, who that?
Pippa, my Australian friend from semester abroad.
She's been CC'd on, like, every single email.
Oh, right.
Well, if my snoring bothers her, she can take the couch.
Or she can just start on the couch and we'll go from there.
We'll figure it out.

- JESS:

Can you be careful with the red wine on the white carpet, please?
My biggest and only donor generously lent us this house for the weekend.
- So, please be careful.

I'm telling you, she's got bigger problems than a wine stain if she wants to sell this place for 3.4 in this market.
- How do you know that?

- I Zillow everybody.

Like, do you know how much my house is worth?
- Mmm-hmm.

Bachelorette kit time.
Let me get your attention.
We got it all.
Bride-to-be bathrobe for our lovely Jess, penis straws, penis sunglasses, penis sprinkles, penis gum, penis hats, penis pasta.
And yes, I did get a little drunk and ate some of that dry.
- Don't judge.

Also, I wrote you a card.

- Thanks, Alice.

(FRANKIE SCREAMS UPSTAIRS)
Oh, shit.

- Frankie?

(LAUGHS) Oh, my God!
- What?

BLAIR:

Is that a sex swing?
Ooh, your donor is a freak, Jess.
Please.

I'm sure somebody else left it here accidentally.
And installed a load-bearing beam to support it accidentally.
- Yeah.

I want to audition some dresses for tonight.
I brought 14.

WOMAN: (SINGING) Yeah, I wanna burn
Break, crash, explode
Every time you look at me, you look at me...
Jess, if you are working,
- I'm gonna smack you in the face right now.

- One second.

- Wait, wait, let me send it.

All right, come on, let's take a picture.
- Say, um, "Miami forever."

- (CAMERA CLICKS) - (ALICE CHUCKLES)
- You want us in the picture or not?

- We're here, too.

- we both look killer in that.

I'm so bummed I can't tag you in this, on Facebook.
Why did you delete your account?
I had to.

- on things that could literally ruin my career.

- Yeah.

It's Pip!

- What?

- JESS:

(SQUEALS SOFTLY)
Sorry.

- I'm sorry.

Hello, hello, hello.
Oh, my God.

(BOTH SQUEAL)
- (LAUGHS)

- Guys...

This is Pippa.
- Hello.

Frankie, Blair, Alice.
Hey, what's up?
My God, you guys are meeting for the first time, this is so exciting.
- I know.

This is so weird, you guys, because it's sort of like you're all Jess's best friends, I'm Jess's best friend.
And so it's sort of like we're all already best friends, you know?
Well, it's a little different for us, sorry to interrupt, but, uh, Jess and I were freshman year roommates, so it's kind of like family.

- I know, I know.

Feel free to gel.
PIPPA:

Ooh.

- Do you want my leftovers?

No, I was gonna wrap that up and take it to go.
I think we're done.

It's okay.

When you got bread and Vegemite, you got yourself a meal.
What?

They should call you cuckoos instead of Kiwis.
Am I right?
- Alice.

That's funny on several levels, because I'm actually Australian and a Kiwi is a New Zealander.
There's nothing wrong with being a Kiwi, we all love Kiwis, but, um, it's sort of like calling a Chinese person Japanese.
It's just sort of like, little bit racist to not recognize the cultural differences there, you know?
Oh, my gosh.
Eat me out.

(LAUGHS) I'll take it.
Pippa, what do you do?
Well, singer-songwriter is the dream.
Uh, party clown is the reality.
- Hmm.

(WHISPERS) A chair.
(MOUTH FULL) Oh, a chair.
Right. (SIGHS)
I'm so excited to see you.

- Tell me everything.

The flight was literally amazoir.
- (SILVERWARE TAPPING GLASS)

Uh, it's toast, toast time.
- JESS:

Raise your glasses, Jess.
Gosh, I can't believe you're getting married.
Feels like just yesterday you were showing me how to hide that cat scratch on my face with that cover-up.
I remember that.
And even though we don't get to see you all the time because you're so busy with Peter and the campaign and changing your Brita filters or whatever it is you white people do,
(VOICE BREAKS) I love you, and you're my best friend.
Uh...

- Be-cheers.

I love you, Alice.

Three toasts is the limit tonight, though.

If you're gonna do another one, do it now, 'cause I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Do you want to come?

It's a heteronormative thing that girls do.
ALICE:

I have my personal favorite, but I don't want to sway anyone, so...
- Is it the one that's circled in big red?

I was kind of hoping that we could make it an early night.
(LAUGHS) Yeah, right.

- That doesn't feel right.

I mean, I've been so overworked...
No, not gonna happen, baby girl, all right?
'Cause this is the biggest weekend of our lives, all right?
Ooh, girls.

Hi.

- You fucking what?

America.

Sort of right on the nose.
- Yes, okay, now we're talking.

Now, okay, I'm in.

Okay, guys, I can't do any cocaine.
I'm running for office.
What?

- Stop.

I haven't really done drugs myself since I sort of...
I smoked this bit of shoji root on an excursion in the desert, and I died.
Anyway, I'm very jet-lagged, so I will do cocaine, yes.
- So everyone's in?

You guys, hold on.

Stop being a stupid fucking cunt and do a little fucking cocaine!
- (SILVERWARE CLATTERS)

Sorry, I did a little bit of it.
(SNIFFS)
ALICE:

It would mean... (WHISPERS) Yeah.
It would mean so much to me, if we could do a little bit of cocaine together.

(ALL INHALING DEEPLY)
- (GRUNTS) So disgusting!

- Let me get a little more.

Before, I was very tired, and now I'm sort of very awake.
That's the cocaine.

I love this.

- Yeah, girl!

(ALL WHOOPING)
Whoo!
Okay, now put on these fucking sashes.
(TROUBLE BY NEON JUNGLE PLAYING)
Trouble
I don't look for trouble, but trouble looks for me
And it's been waiting around corners since I was 17
They say, "Here comes a hurricane Trouble is her middle name"
But I don't look for trouble, yeah, trouble looks for me

I'll make an excellent wife
Man, I swear I really try

But it's gettin' kinda blurry
Get blurry with it
Got my eyes on you
But you're gettin' kinda blurry, no hurry with it
Rock your body, and it all makes sense
Got me up under your influence
I'm getting us drinks.
Knockout blurry, no worries
You guys, you guys, let's get Jess a stripper!
- Yes!

Right?
You guys, you guys, you guys, male or female, though?
Male.

- Yeah.

Frankie, do you have a tampon?
- I need one.

- Thank you.

What day of your flow are you on?
Oh, no, no.

In college, we would ask each other for tampons if some guy was skeezing us out and we wanted to be saved.
You just say "tampon," and they run.
PIPPA:

I used to use tampons, but now I use David cups.
- You mean DivaCups.

They were designed by my neighbor, David, to collect blood for an art installation he's doing.
Let's stop talking about periods now.
Cool.
All right, everybody, we have a special request from a Caucasian named
- (SINGSONGY) Alice!

That's me.

Bring all your girls up here.

Jess, come on.

Give her the drinks.

We won the talent show freshman year with this little routine.
Might want to stand back.

(CHUCKLES) Okay.
If you didn't go to college with us, you're not in the routine.
Okay, get into places.

Did anybody see me fall?
- Everybody saw.

- Alice!

It was be-gorgeous!
Jess, you were supposed to catch me.
You know, I forgot that one part.

It's a pretty important part!
Would some more cocaine make you feel better?
Yes!
- I'm gonna party till the break of day - (ALL SNIFFING)

This Montepulciano is majestic and rebellious.
Tell me, what are you tasting?

It's Jess.

I'm drunk!

PETER:

I don't want to do anything illegal tonight.

You just snorted a mound of cocaine.
- Simultaneously.

That was, like, for Jess.
- Don't put that on me.

You're literally cuckoo.
I'm just, like, voicing what some people are thinking,

Okay, no snags.
Um, is...

God, it is so warm.
- You guys have to get in.

I am coming.
I am gonna warn you now.
Uh, did not have time to self-wax, so it is like a jungle down there.

Like, with those weird little, like, paper strips?
Yikes, dude.

Hey, um, I, uh, I got to take a piss.
Oh, yeah, there's a bathroom down there.
All right.
It's, like, down there.

I bet he's going to fluff his junk!
Let's give him room, let's make a stage, yes.
You guys, I don't want a stripper.
I think he looks like he's on something.
He's definitely on something.

Oh, my God, he's gonna eat our faces.

Maybe somebody else should go.

Why don't you do something, Blair!
I'm delegating!

Oh, God.
- Oh, not the bathroom towels.

What are you talking about!
Who cares about towels right now?
Well, I don't know!

I killed a guy!
Oh, God!
- I killed a guy today.

- Deep breaths, deep breaths.

- Deep breath.

"What have you been up to?"
(SNIFFS) "Death."
(INHALES, EXHALES)
- Keep it in there.

Time to call the police.

No, no, no, don't call the police.

Let's get rid of the drugs, and then we'll call the police.
Yeah, we'll just, we'll clean up a dead stripper, cool.
Well, technically, he's a prostitute.
(COUGHING)
- He's a prostitute?

I got him from Craigslist.
He is a stripper, but then also an escort.
You hired a gigolo?
Don't judge sex work, Blair!
- Oh, my God!

You know I'm running for public office!

It's worse for me.

If I get a third, I could go to jail for 25 to life.
I'm not even supposed to be out of the state right now.
I had to pry my ankle monitor off with a shoehorn to get here!
Oh, God.
It's the chair's fault.
Fuckin' shit chair!
Wait a minute.

It was an accident.

So, like, we're not gonna get in trouble for an accident.
FRANKIE:

A white dude is dead at the hands of a bunch of women.
BLAIR:

I'm black, in case any of you have forgotten.
I think the only person who's forgotten that is you.
How dare you.
I rest my case.
I knew this weekend was a terrible idea.
What?

This can still be the best weekend of our fucking lives!
Let's just smile a little bit about it.

Okay, we're gonna be fine.
- We're gonna call the cops, but Jess is right.

We need to make this seem as innocent as possible, so let's get rid of all the drugs.
I'm on it. (SNIFFS)
- Alice, not by doing them!

Okay, someone tell me what to do, and I will do it.
- (SHUDDERS) Uh?

- (ALICE AND PIPPA GRUNT)

- Oh.

(PIPPA PANTING HEAVILY)
It's pizza.
You guys, what are we gonna do?
The house is made of glass.

We got to move him, you guys.
- (KNOCKING)

- (PANICKED CHATTER) - (DOORBELL RINGS)
JESS:

Wait, wait, wait, you guys.
You guys, you guys, you guys, wait, wait, wait.

- (KNOCKING)

(SQUEALS)
(DOORBELL RINGS)
- Shit.

Does anyone have cash for a tip?
I have Australian dollars.
They're stronger than American dollars.
DELIVERY MAN:

- What's this?

- Oh, God.

I was natural.
Okay, open it.
Open it up.
Oh, yes.
How can you eat right now?
Eating is the number one way people deal with stress, okay?
Don't give me shit.
You guys want some?
- Oh, yeah, I'd go for a slice.

Okay, I think now it's time for us to call the cops, yeah?
Wait, wait, wait.

- Okay.

We're gonna be interrogated?
We are 1Ø0% gonna be interrogated.
Somebody died in a sketchy way.
They're gonna separate us into little cells, you know, with swinging lights.
The coppers are gonna try to crack us, fucking pigs!
Okay, let's definitely call a lawyer, then.
Oh, my God.

He was on the team that defended Bernie Madoff.
- Ah, thank God.

Wait.

- JESS:

- Shit!

The foam party!
Should I sell our passes?
BLAIR:

You're right.

Smart, Jess.
(RINGTONE PLAYING)
Oh, shit!

- Okay.

- Do not answer that.

- No!

Hello!
- Hey, babe.

- Stop.

- Hang up.

Yeah, everything's great.
Did you do whippets again?

- What?

- Hang up.

- Peter, something really bad happened.

- What?

He was a stripper, like, a prostitute.
- A prostitute?

About what?

- (FRANTIC WHISPERING)

- You can't, you can't...

- Jess!

I can't believe you just did that.
We can't talk to anybody until we consult with a lawyer.
She's right.

I'm collecting everyone's phones until we know what the plan is.
- Agreed?

- Yes.

- Mmm-hmm.

- Well, I have a game on it that relaxes me.

Thank you.
♪♪
Okay, so we got to get this burner phone from a convenience store.
- Smart.

Frankie and I can go.
- Great.

- Or, like, anybody else could go.

- Do we argue?

- (CHUCKLES) It's true, but...

That's funny.

- It's semantics.

Wow, I didn't realize I was talking to a wordsmith.
- They used to be lovers, yeah?

I'm a wordsmith 'cause I read the news regularly.
- Is it that obvious?

- I'm too busy shopping, right?

- (OTHERS CONTINUE ARGUING)

Just because I don't use Tom's of Maine deodorant, which, by the way, does not work...
I don't use Tom's deodorant...
- It's kind of nasty to watch, isn't it?

PETER:

- Uh-huh.

I know something's wrong immediately.
And then, finally, she admits it.
She says something really bad happened with a prostitute.
- OTHERS:

But if she was going to cheat, this is when she would do it.
- Oh, God.

- It's pretty classic.

It's not cheating if it's with a prostitute.

- TOBEY:

Look, guys, we have to have realistic attitudes about sexual exclusivity.
Whatever.

I asked her if she still wanted to get married.
She screamed "no" and then she hung up!
So, guess what, guys, there's no wedding for you to go to, so return your tuxes.
OTHERS:

- No.

It's not a shock, right?
I mean, buddy, I love you, you're one of my best friends, but you're a six and she's a... (TAKES BREATH) Twenty.
- Oh, my God.

Oh, I'm feeling...

- I'm feeling dizzy, I'm...

- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

I knew I shouldn't date out of my league, I knew it.
When she first asked me out, I thought it was a prank.
I could feel her pulling away, but I thought it was work.
- (BELCHES) I'm gonna be sick.

- Give him some Madeira.

- Yeah.

- Chug-a-lug.

Yes!
FRANKIE:

Yeah, but this way no one can definitively ID our face.
FRANKIE:

Any brand is fine.
What's that on your face?
A detoxifying mud mask.
Look, we need a burner phone, okay?
- Here's some cash.

- MAN:

You baby boomers are so demanding.
WOMAN:

- Jesus.

ALICE:

- And it's, like, all my fault.

It really is a tragedy, you know?
He could have been a scientist that was gonna cure cancer or something.
- It's nice of you to say.

Guys, is he looking, like, straight at me?
- Oh, my God, he's...

He's looking at me, right?

PIPPA:

Hi, baby boy.
Mummy Hubbard's here.
She's gonna send you home.
Okay.
Sleep now.
- Oh, no.

- Okay, why don't we...

- I don't like it.

- I got it.

- I'm done.

He looks good, right?
ALL:

- PIPPA:

Look at this ring.
It's even bigger in real life than it is on Skype.
- Yeah, he did a good job.

You guys Skype?
- Yes.

Yes.
It's really nice to just sort of, you know, see the person when you're talking to them.
- I didn't know that.

You don't know Skype?
Skype is a free video calling app.
- You should...

Jess, you said you couldn't remember your password.
Well, it is really hard to sign in.
(BARKING)
- Oh, shit!

- Whose dog is that?

- Go!

- The owner is coming towards the house.

No, no, no.

I can speak to animals, we have a deep understanding,
- so I got this.

ALICE:

PIPPA:

Okay, Charlie.

- Come on, come on.

PIPPA:

- Ow.

- MAN:

This is impossible, anybody can see into the house from the beach.
- This is crazy.

If someone reports it before we do, we're dead.
Well, we just...

- Yeah, okay.

- Okay.

- You all right?

Oh, my God, Pip, I can see all of his teeth marks.
That looks really bad.
No, no, no.

That's not...

Yeah, she's fine.

Okay?

- Let's do it.

- Let's go!

PIPPA:

ALICE:

- Yeah, we got it.

(LOUD CRASH)
PIPPA:

JESS:

- PIPPA:

- That's better.

Shit!

Why?

JESS:

This is a poltergeist situation.
I'm not doing anything.
- All right.

- Oh, God.

There is a taxi right here.
No!

No, thank you.
- Cover the body.

- Balls!

Find a quilt.

- DRIVER:

- Oh, no.

No, no, I just peed.
- PIPPA:

Close, you fuck.
- Here you go, sir.

- Thank you very much for the ride.

- Safe home!

We're starting a garage band.

We're hiding a body.

BLAIR:

- Alice, what the hell are you doing, man?

- Come on.

Lift him up with your legs.

JESS:

Just hold one second.
- There's two stairs up here.

- I got it.

Break, break, break.
- ALICE:

- Okay.

- PIPPA:

Why are we moving the dead stripper?
The whole house is made out of glass.
This is impossible.

Where could we put him that he's not gonna be seen?
(SQUEAKING, CREAKING)
BLAIR: (ON PHONE) So, what do you think, Uncle Jack?
They could charge you with involuntary manslaughter, but it's not that easy to prove.
- Ah, thank God.

- That's okay.

- or the scene, and you'll be fine.

Okay, so actually, we have already moved him to a sex swing, Your Honor.
What?
I said, "Actually, we have already moved him to a sex swing, Your Honor."
I heard you.
You knowingly tampered with the scene, which means you're guilty of accessory after the fact, and they'll have a strong case for involuntary manslaughter.
Wait, what does that mean?
Up to 15 years in prison.
- What?

- ALICE:

- It's a burner phone.

Like I told Rob Lowe, if there's no body, there's no case.
We can't just chop him up.
You know what?

No, we all moved the body.
It's a crime.
Well, yeah, but if we just, like, explain the situation...
FRANKIE:

Last year, a guy in Tampa, he threatened to kill his wife, so she fired a warning shot, and she went to jail for 20 years.
This country should be burned to the ground!
Shit.
I was so close.

My career.
It's all over, just like that.
I'm gonna do real time.
Maybe life.
You guys are gonna get off with a few years.
I can't do any years.

- What?

What?
Malcolm and I separated six months ago.
You didn't tell me.
Yeah, you've been a little preoccupied, Jess.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't need your judgment.
Blair, I would never judge you for something like that.
Oh, my God, my students.
They idolize me.
They think I'm, like, the best fucking adult in the whole fucking world.
They'll turn to crime.
I can't go to jail.
I couldn't even make it through the first episode of Orange Is the New Black.
(CRYING) None of us can.
(SNIFFLES) It's too soapy, right?
No, I meant none of us can go to jail.

PIPPA:

Even if we don't get charged with this tampering with evidence thing, we don't know who this man is.
His family could come seek revenge.
He could be part of a cartel that's gonna cut off our toes and stick them up our bums.
BLAIR:

We'll have to look over our shoulders for the rest of our lives.
He did say that it would be hard to convict with no body.
I mean, it was an accident.
And he's not part of an escort company, you know?
So I don't think anybody knows he's here.
Mmm-hmm.
We got to get rid of him.
- We gotta, right?

- We do.

- I mean, we don't want to.

We didn't want to kill him.
- We have no other option.

- Of course we have to.

Must.
(LINE RINGING)
ON VOICE MAIL:

Okay.

That means something really bad happened.
Dude, this is, like, the third girlfriend that's cheated on you.
What is that?

Does your dick bend weird when it gets hard?
No.
- All right.

Let's get you on Tinder right now, so you can start on a rebound.
- No, I don't want to be on Tinder, okay?

You've gotten over other girls, you can get over her.
Yeah, this isn't some girl, this is Jess.

And I don't want to get over her.
Then, this time, do something about it, Peter.
(TOBEY SCOFFS)
You're right.
You're right, I got to go to Miami, and I got to win her back.
- Yes, dude.

The first flight out of Charleston gets in at 1Ø:

TOBEY:

Not quick enough.

- What?

He has to sad astronaut.
- Okay, what is that?

- Sad astronaut?

Okay. (EXHALES)
Lisa Marie Nowak was an astronaut.
And she was in love with another astronaut named Will.
Now, Will cheated on Lisa with some hottie Air Force captain.
Lisa found out and was pissed.
So, Lisa decided to deal with it.
Once and for all.

Point is, she used that crazy astrophysicist brain to find the quickest way to Florida.
- You...

Then you got to sad astronaut, bro.
Let's get some diapers.

JESS:

- I think it's the body on top.

- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

Okay, wait, does anyone know how to actually drive this thing, or...
PIPPA:

I, uh, I took one to school every day growing up, so, I feel pretty confident.
- Great.

LEA:

- Hello!

- The neighbors!

Okay, oh, my God, oh, my God, what do we do?
- No, no...

(LAUGHING)
- So happy to see you.

- Nope.

We hoped you were skinny-dipping.
- No. (LAUGHING)

- Nope.

- My, my.

FRANKIE:

WOMEN:

Um, you know, I think they just wanted to make love in international waters.
- PIETRO:

Uh, no.

So, let's just...
Well, this certainly gets me in the mood.
- JESS:

- You need a tampon?

We just opened a bottle of Chateauneuf Du Pape, and we're listening to some remastered Fleetwood Mac.
- Oh, that's so nice.

- I bet.

- Oh, that's so sweet.

Unless it's asked for.
(LAUGHS) Okay.
I am fully exhausted.
- So tired, you know?

We're fluent in body language.
Oh, I bet you are.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
- Goodnight.

ALICE:

- (BLAIR LAUGHS) - (THUDS)
- Oh, God.

- Pippa.

- What is going on there?

- Pippa!

Oh, my God.

Yeah.

(EXHALES)
- Sorry.

- Let's dump him, yeah?

PIPPA:

(QUIET GRUNTING)
- Oof.

Uh, if Jess hooked up with a Spanish speaker,
- you're gonna want to reason with him.

Oh, um, and I got this generic Russian Adderall.
My little brother ordered it online.
It will help you focus.
It's super strong, but it is expired, so...
- Thank you so much.

- I love you.

- Get her back.

- Mmm...

You are peeing.
I'm so scared.
I feel like we should say something.
FRANKIE:

We're really sorry.
You deserved better.
BLAIR:

There's nothing we could do to bring you back, but...
We promise to spend the rest of our lives trying to be better people.
- We owe that to you.

God, we're so sorry.
So sorry.
So sorry, man.
We suck.
(SIGHING, SNIFFLING)
Okay, you can dump him now!
Aye aye, Captain.
(STARTS ENGINE)
This never happened.

- Nope.

Right?
- No, we're not gonna talk about it.

Okay, bye. (GRUNTS)
BLAIR:

That could have been more delicate, huh?
(ENGINE ROARING)
She's going really fast.
I did it!
- Oh, my God, what the fuck is she doing?

- (YELLS)

ALICE:

- I'm good.

Are you sure, 'cause you landed right on your neck.
Yeah, I just did a sort of straight shot, landed on the neck...
- (CRACK) - ...snap, and we're back up.
- It was good.

I thought you knew how to drive those things.
Yeah, no, I definitely do, but, um, I think the gas and the brake are different
- in Australia, so I got confused.

- How are you alive right now?

But I'll take it.
(LAUGHING)
Well, body dumped, girl's alive.
- What's next?

- Great idea.

JESS:

Guys?
She should probably get a CAT scan.
PIPPA:

She's fine.

- Is there any more pizza left?

No!
Jesus, dude, we can order more.
No, not that.

You know, from the cameras.
- Oh. (SCOFFS) Those don't work.

- Excuse me, what?

But we know that's not what this was about.
Right?

- Creating a mise en scène.

Why would someone have security cameras that don't work?
They didn't charge us for the first three months.
After that, we didn't want to pay for the service.
LEA:

You'll just have to jerk off as the Italians do.
- To your memories.

Wait, so, Blair, so there's no footage?

She was inside me.
And then she was outside me.
And then she was me.

What is a human friendtipede?
It's a photo we always take that's like the movie Human Centipede.
Where they're sewn together, mouth to anus, but it's with friends,
- so it's special.

- I don't know about that.

Guys, if I don't post a ton of pictures from this weekend, it's gonna look suspicious.

I'm gonna go to the beach and do a bit of mindful meditation.
And, um, when I come back,
I'm gonna have a be-genius idea.
Yeah?

(YAWNS) We got it.
(GASPS) We're never gonna get rid of his body.
He's gonna follow us around for the rest of our lives.

What are you doing?

No!

(GRUNTING)
- Fuck!

- Frankie!

Now we have a dead guy and an unconscious cop?
- What is wrong with you?

He's obviously a rape cop.

When they have dirt on you, they sexually assault you, knowing you won't report it.
- Daniel Holtzclaw, Oklahoma City?

He sexually assaulted eight women.
Like Matt Dillon in Crash.
- Oh, my God, that was horrendous.

Information is power, guys.

Okay, chill out.

Okay. "You are not your father's daughters but mothers unto your own."
Wait, is that John Mayer?
It's Malcolm X.
- Pretty sure it's John Mayer.

Okay, you guys, you guys, we have to move this guy before the neighbors return to eat Blair out again.
- (GROANS)

- All right.

All right, one, two, three.
(ALL GASP)
Uh...
Frankie, how many strippers did you order?
Just the one.
Then who's this guy?
- Let me see his dick real quick.

- Wait, what?

- But I can ID him by his member.

(SIGHS)
I'm not sure.
He had a boner in his ad.
This one's soft.
I can get it hard.

- What?

This is Scotty with the Body.

Um, Alice.
- What's up, dude?

Oh, I'm just making sure nothing's broken.
I think he's fine.
Yeah, he's really fine.
- Jesus.

You need to masturbate more.

(SIGHS) I know.

She's very smart.
- Why don't you put her in a cage?

But I'm loud.

- I remember.

And it kind of sounds like her.
So she thinks I'm talking to her.
I'm like, "No, I'm just fucking touching myself."
- Like, "Back off."

Cool, so back to our life-changing emergency?
- (DISGUSTED GROANS)

- That's good.

Um, there is still a dead guy in the closet, so...
- Who is that guy?

Oh, my God.

(BLAIR GASPS)

That'll work.
- Thank God!

All right, we're gonna drive to the alligator bog, dump the body.
We're gonna return the Smart car, wake up the G-string guy, tell him he hit his head really hard.
- Blair's gonna give him a ton of cash.

- And then we're home free.
