My brother, jacob greenleaf....
Previously on "greenleaf"...
The plan was to move triumph over here,
But right here is the new pastor.
Of triumph two,
Jacob greenleaf.
People love to see the high brought low,
Even if based on nothing but hearsay.
This friday feature about churchgoers.
In the d.A.'s office...

Slowing the investigation down.
Written by this darius nash?
What an insidious way this man has.
You're hired.

Should know before you pull that trigger.
Full disclosure...

That's no problem.
Daddy, I need your help.
You know I never could deny you.
What do you need?
You.

Stay the hell out of my business, you hear me?
I was trying to help.
I told you he was not the problem.
Kevin, I have no idea what is going on with the two of you.
Charity, I've been doing some research.
About what?
What I've been struggling with.
You are what you are.
You can't change that.
We were up with that baby all night?
You know he's still struggling with that rash,
But he'll be fine.
We had a long and wonderful conversation.
Jacob scheduled the movers.
That's a shame.
I was looking forward to watching him carry.
All that furniture we bought him across town,
Piece by ill-gotten piece.
When are you gonna tell him who basie skanks really is?
If you tell him, he'll stay, james.
I'm not even sure it's true.
As I recall, darrell had two daughters,
And that was it.
Do you remember any boys in that family?
No.
But men have been known.
To let their seed fly on the wind,
Desiring for fields not their own.
I'll talk to him about it.
Thank you.
But I won't beg him to stay.
Far be it from me to ask you to scuff your pride.
In the name of something.
As small and worthless as love.
Come here.

What?
Baby.
What?
Hey!
Where's that boy's father?
It doesn't have to be a novel.
Just try one sentence.
"Hello, isaiah."
Doesn't even have to have a verb.
And what if he doesn't text back?
Come on, sliding into the d.M.S is a critical component.
In 21st century dating.
You've been staring at his instagram.
For 10 days now.
No, wait, give it back!
"Hey, isaiah.

Was wondering about your relationship situation."
Stop!
I just don't want to seem desperate.
But you are.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
You know, isaiah rehearses every saturday at triumph.
We could go.
That wouldn't be weird?
It would.
How long you been here?
I couldn't sleep.
Go get ready for school.
Do you want to be bae goals 2017 or not?
Closed mouths don't get fed.
Hey, she's gonna miss me.

I'm not arguing with you.
Isaiah hambrick?
Eavesdropping's a sin, you know.
Why didn't you come down?
Because I wasn't in the mood for another one.
Of my father's paranoid
"basie skanks is out to get me" speeches.
There you go.
That being said, I need to talk to basie.
About that foolishness he pulled last week.
He should've told us he was giving me that church.
Definitely not making my life any easier.
Wait a minute, pastor.
There you go.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Okay.
Can't wait to get out of here.
Tasha's finally showing me the parsonage this afternoon,
So we could be out of here as soon as next week.
Mwah.
Pastor greenleaf.
Bishop's ring cleared, scoop.
Story's over.

I'm not here for the paper.
That's a nice try.
I thought you might want to go on a post-scandal date.
Yeah, to celebrate.
You know, whoever told you you were funny.
Did the world a great disservice.
I'm serious.
Look, I'll be off the clock.
Is that really possible?
I give you my word as a christian.
Mr. Nash, I'm flattered.
No.
Okay.
If you change your mind.
And it's darius.
Good morning, pastor.

Have we heard back yet from that girl at hallelujah 95.7?
The one who finds you so terribly transformative?
I have, actually.
And?
She's having me come in next week.
To do an interview with mike o.
Well, be sure to give him my best.
Outside of the lord, mae, I assure you,
You will be my main theme.
You rang, mama?
What is that thing?
It's mama's way of saying "come,".
In lieu of a dog whistle or a chain.
It bestows a certain poetry upon something.
Which might otherwise be merely mechanical.
And it saves me from listening.
To that interminable voice message on her phone.
What can I do for you, mama?
We want you to fire carlton.
Because betty wilcox has an issue with gay marriage?

No, this is about more than betty wilcox.
Over half the deacon board haven't even pledged yet.
And his brazenness causes concern.
For many of our other members.
Says who?

Says half the deacon board.
Then they should go somewhere else.
Well, that's the problem...

Are you okay with this?
I can't lose half the deacon board.
Over a choir director.
Wasn't he fired from another church?
Two churches.

And he lost.
I won't do it.
Gigi...
Who's gonna direct the choirs?
I will not debate this with you.
You are the associate pastor.
Now, are you going to fire him, or do I have to do it?
I'll take care of it.
And do it soon, please.
Betty's leaving town for new orleans.
To see that granddaughter that you baptized,
And I don't want her leaving here.
Without writing us a check.
Captions paid for by discovery communications.
What'd you think?
Sold.
Thank you.
What's good, pastor greenleaf?
Yeah, so, just real quick...
No, for you, I got nothing but time.
I met with the g.C., all right?
They're gonna start digging the foundation this week.
I'm also putting together a packet of.
Potential worship team hires for you to take a look at.
Boy, you firing on all cylinders, aren't you, pastor?
I'm trying to, yeah.
Yeah.

Um, also wanted to say...
In the future...
Speak your heart.

If you, - if you plan on giving me big news.
Like you did last week...
I remember the look on your face.
You were like moses on the mountaintop up there.
"What?"
Yeah, so, just, -
Just kind of give me a heads up from now on.
Well, if god had given me prior notice,
I certainly would've given it to you.
So, you're gonna tell me.
You didn't have any plans to do that?
What do you mean?
The lord just gave it to me to do, brother,
Right then and there, and I did it.
I'm just finding that a little hard to believe.
Pastor greenleaf.
Yeah?
You languished in the shadow of your father.
Like some anemic little weed.
In the space of three short months,
I have given you a church, a place to live if you wanted,
And access to your own soul the way god made it to be.
Before your daddy grabbed ahold of it.
And started stomping it flat with his contempt.
I've given you everything you ever wanted.
And I appreciate everything you've done.
Then don't accuse me of lying.
I'm your brother.
Got to trust me.
Okay.
Sorry.
Okay, then.
Boy, what I wouldn't give to have a cigarette.
Sometimes on a day like this.
God says, "no, can't have that."
I want you to go out to southwind.
This afternoon, door to door.
Spread the word about triumph two.
I think most of the black folks out there already go to calvary.
I know.
So, how happy would they be to see you?
What a blessing.
Wow.
That's all I meant.
I love that.
And with all the parts...

Any time you can get voices to weave in.
And out like that, pressing against each other,
Sailing away, coming back home again...
That just puts a person smack in the heart of god.
That's how I see it, anyway.
Did I say something wrong?
No!
No, that was beautiful.
Hey.
Sorry to interrupt.
No.

Jabari is producing my album.
Nice to meet you.

You got a second?
Yeah.
So, who will direct the choir?
I guess mama assumes you.

Wanda's not a choir director, and I just had a baby.
I need more help now, not less.

And immoral.

Well, no, I understand.
Why people like betty think what they think,
But it's not very loving.
But can't you just talk to daddy?
One little "but, daddy" from gigi.
Usually fixes something like this.
Daddy was sitting right there when mama asked me to fire him.
He's in.
And I actually think you are the only person.
Who can stop this from happening.
Okay.

I'm sorry to lay this on you.
No, don't be.
It's just one more thing.
I'll handle it.
Thank you.
Gigi.

Thanks for including me.
Of course.
I have jeremiah, earl,
J. Anthony, and rebecca at the p.F.
What about lionel?
Well, he hasn't gotten back to me about preaching,
Let alone lodging.
I'll call him myself.
I don't feel good about begging the man.
Let it be.
He just lost patrice, didn't he?
Well, she didn't take his phone.
With her to the grave or his manners.
Is that lionel?
It's mac.
Now, that's three times, now.
What do you want, mac?
You know, I couldn't care less.
And listen, don't make me change this number.
Just don't call me again.
What'd he want?
Daddy's dying today.
But that's according to him, you know,
And I never know anymore whether he's making some excuse.
Just to keep in contact with me or do... you know?
Are you sure you don't want to go visit the man.
And get things settled?
He kept you out of jail,
And that's settled enough for me.
Praise the lord!
How you doing?

Can I have a minute to talk to you about triumph church?
Gymnasium, pilates, everything, man.
And the bag and the mug are yours to keep.
What you doing here?
Just, telling people about triumph two.
About the church that's going up down the street?
Yes, ma'am.

Does bishop know you're here recruiting?
I'm not recruiting.
I'm, just letting folks know there's an option.
I'm giving out mugs.
I don't need a mug.
They're recyclable.
I don't care if it came from the winding cloth.
That they wrapped my lord in when he died.
I'm with calvary.
And you ought to be ashamed of yourself!
The lord is speaking to you in all things,
So in all things,
Respond as if you're responding to god.
101.
I think that's a good tweet for today.
Hey, mama.

Yes, come on in.
Hey!

You know, I told corin.
To stay on top of me about this tweeting thing,
And it is really paying off.
How many followers do you have?
70,000 and counting.
Yeah.
So, now I want you to ice that cake with some hashtags...
Hashtag obedience, hashtag kindness.
Already did it, all right?
You see?
Wow.
Praise god we had the wisdom to hire that girl.
Especially these days.
Mama, are you okay?
Yes, I'm okay, baby.
Grace told me the deacons are trying to push carlton out.
Nobody said any sort of thing.
We are just trying to firm up our financial base...
Cut costs where we can.
So, it has nothing to do with carlton being gay?
It is purely a financial decision.
Well, then, can we cut something else?
Well, I don't know.

Now, what about this music producer,
This jabari?
Now, I think I saw a check going out for $50,000.
But it's less than he usually charges.
But it's more than we usually spend.
Kevin produced your last album.
Why don't you just let kevie do it?
No, kevin's not really a producer.
What is going on between you two?
Your father is losing patience.
With all this loose jell-o kind of thing,
And I can't say that I blame him.
Mama, I gave carlton my word that this wouldn't happen.
Just don't make a liar out of me, please.
This is not a discussion.
And I apologize for anything.
That led you to believe that it was.
Okay.
Hey, "shawty," can I get them trigonometry notes, or not?
Lord have mercy.
Isaiah just invited me to his rehearsal.
Let me see.

What do I do?
I know they say there's no such thing as dumb questions,
But, girl.
Will you come with me?
No.
I'm kidding.

I got you, I got you!
We know that if our earthly house.
Of this tabernacle were to be absolved,
We have a building of god.
Not made with hands,
Eternal in the universe.
Amen.
James?
Yes, henry, it's me.
I did what mae said.
I know you did, and thank you.
Henry...
Did darrell james have a son?
I remember the two little girls, but I don't remember a boy.
Mac?
I was just leaving.
You'll be in my prayers, henry.
James... don't speak to me.
The lord says I have to forgive you,
And one day I may.
But I will never forget.
I will leave you to deal with your father.
Until you have to deal with ours.
I don't want to die.
I know.
I know.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna just like when you threw me in coro lake.
It's gonna be cold,
It's gonna be scary,
And then... you're gonna swim.
You gonna swim all the way across to Jesus...
All the way home to the lord.
You're gonna swim.
Brother kevin.

How's lita?
As well as can be expected.

Listen, I've been meaning to give this to you.
It's a gift card for the baby from both of us.
Thank you.

I saw him roll by earlier.

Yeah, we're feeling pretty blessed.
And that rash is clearing up.
Just like I told charity it would.
What rash is that?
The one that's been keeping him up.
That rash.
Yeah, he's doing a lot better now.
Well, thank you for this,
And I probably should get back to work.
All right.

Thank you.
All righty.

Nice.
Thank you.
You're gonna love it.
Come on.

Come on!
So, I actually used to sell real estate.
Before I joined basie and the ministry.
And I can tell you that for this neighborhood,
This is a very attractive property.
I can imagine it's a little like, "what?"
You know, but basie and I shared a great five years here.
And I know that once you and jacob move in.
And make it your own that you're gonna love it.
Just like we did.
And I can help you decorate, too, if you want.
I did stage all the houses when I was a realtor,
So I've got a certified eye.
That'd be great.
Good.

Hey.

So, what'd mama say?
What do you think?
No, and it's not up for discussion.
So, what are we gonna do?

That's not true.
We can both march back up in her office.
Gigi, I'm not about to do that.
Charity, you promised him.
If you want to make this another one of your crusades,
Then go ahead, but I can't.
Honey, why?

I'm sorry.
It's nash.
Hey.

Okay.
This is happening an hour before I expected it to.
I don't want to go on a date.
Fine.
Slow day at church?
Actually, I want to get together and talk about something else,
If that's okay.
Is that okay?
As long as I pick the place.
Done.
When I look back now at the way I behaved,
I feel like I'm looking at a whole different person.
I think you are.

Real transformation is the goal,
And you achieved that.
Congrats.
What's up, ladies?
Hey.

Thanks for coming out.
You're pastor greenleaf's daughter.
He's sort of my dad, yes.
We love your music.
She loves your music.
I think it's okay to mildly great.
Zora, right?

Cool.

Hope that's okay.
It's perfectly fine.
I'm sort of a public figure.

How do you like triumph?
It's cool.
The hook in that last song, um, would that work?
I mean, it worked.

Cool.
Kevin, how's it going with your wife?
Any chance I'm gonna see her at a meeting.
One of these nights?
I don't know.
She still got me staying in a hotel.
After nathan was born.
And today, I found out he had a rash.
And she didn't even tell me about it.
I don't know what to do.
Look, kevin, I know from experience, brother,
Blah.
You probably feel like you're the whole problem.
To say the least.

If your wife isn't ready to do that,
Well, that's her prerogative.
This might be a situation.
Where you need to step up and lead.
Be the man.
It may be what she's hoping you'll do.
Is it okay?
I mean, no, it's great, it's good.
Good.
I didn't even know this place was here.
Yeah, it's an insider thing.
But they let you in.

I'm sorry it's so loud.
I didn't know there'd be music tonight.
Yeah, I don't believe you.
Well, I...

I mean, we can go somewhere else if you...
No, no, this is good.
We can talk later.
You want to dance?
No.

Nobody here goes to church.
I don't know.

Come on, come on.

Come on, come on!
James?
Wait a minute.
James?
Wha...
Good evening, dear.
Have you spoken to jacob yet?
You said you were gonna do it.
And... and I haven't, 'cause I have the rather hopeless feeling that...
That he'll see you actually want him leave.
To put a fine point on it, yes.
Why are you so hard on him?
All he's ever done is try to please you.
May I be frank with you, mae?

Ever since gigi started preaching,
You have forced that boy into my field of vision out of nothing,
I believe, except jealousy of your own daughter.
Jealousy?

And a variety of talents.
He never showed any evidence of having.
And gigi does?
She did.
Until we broke her spirit.
And she ran off and left us.
Please.
I'm sorry if I've misdirected my anger.
About all this to him,
But he seems to have drank the kool-aid you brewed.
And between the two of you, I'm about to lose my mind.
Let him go.
Jacob deserves to know the truth about basie.
Before he's subject to his authority.
Or do you not even love your son enough to do that?
Hey.
From darlene.
You couldn't give me this tomorrow?
Why didn't you tell me about nathan's rash?
Well, it wasn't a big deal.
He's my son, too.
I know he's your son.
I didn't think you'd freak out about it.
I'm not freaking out.

For the past three months, I'm trying to make things right,
And it feels like I'm still being punished.
You're not the only one who feels punished.
But I'm the only one that's trying.
You should've told me about the rash.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
No, no.
Let me.

Okay.
My brother used to always give me.
So much heat about my two left feet.
Well, there was no evidence of them tonight.
When we were growing up, my parents only let us.
Listen to secular music on saturday night.
But jacob had this boom box in his room,
So we would have dance wars...

Who'd win?

It was his boom box,
And he always picked everybody's songs.
That doesn't sound fair to me.
Yeah.
Not much is, is it?
What did you want to talk about?
Nothing.
Didn't sound like that earlier.
Off the record?
Promise.
My parents are making me fire our choir director.
Why are they letting him go?

And some folks at the church have a problem with it.
And I guess he was fired from a couple of churches.
Before that for the same reason.
Kind of makes you wonder why he keeps trying, doesn't it?
No, I get that.
You know, there's something you get in church.
That you don't get anywhere else.
You said you're a christian?
I am.
Do you go to church?
No.
I didn't think so.
But I do know what you're saying.

I mean, I miss some things.
And then, there's some things I do not miss at all.
So, what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna do it.
If I don't do it, somebody else will do it.
And I'd rather it come from me.
I got to go.

Thank you for everything.
It's my pleasure.
Am I gonna see you again?
Well, I hope so.
You were driving the corolla.
That was what, our third date?
The night I met your family.
I remember.

Some mini-sermon about godly restraint.
And lady mae wanted my entire family genealogy.
Especially after she saw that car.
Do you remember how I broke down.
Right when we were trying to leave?
Right at the front gate.
And me and jacob were under the hood.
Trying to get it to start again,
And you sitting in the front seat.
With your legs crossed like a princess.
Well, there was nothing else I could do.
Our little man's gonna get tired of hearing those stories.
Maybe you should stay the night.
You can wake up with him.
You sure?
Yeah.
I'd like that.
Okay.
Jacob?
Yes, sir.
You eating standing up like a horse?
There's another half there on the plate.
I could throw some texas pete on there, the way you like it.
It's too late for that texas pete,
At least for this old man.
How's the new job working out?
It's great.

Why?
I know you're not gonna believe what I've got to say.
Wait, yeah, pop...
You're not gonna let me finish?
Please, just don't.
I don't want to hear any more about your conspiracy theories.
About you and basie skanks.
My life's not about you, pop.
It's about me.
Test test test test test test.
Wy.
T
I know.

When do you give a damn about what I think?
You don't want me there, you don't want me here.
What do you want?
What am I supposed to do?
Basie skanks might not be perfect.
He might be boo boo the fool.
At least he's not a false prophet.
Bishop find you?
Yeah, he found me.
What happened?
I've done everything he's asked...
Loyal, worked hard, put my time in,
Worshipped the ground that man walked on.
All he ever had to do was just...
Was just say, "good job, son."
I mean, hey, maybe,
"I couldn't have done it without you."
Instead, what I get?
"Gigi would have done it better.

I wasn't quite feeling the word today, jacob."
He doesn't respect me.
He doesn't respect me as an ordained pastor,
As his son, as a man.
I respect you.
I know you don't like that place,
But we're getting out of here.
Good morning, lady mae.

You wanted to see me?

Thank you.
Carlton, let me start by saying.
What a wonderful addition.
Your ministry of music has been here at calvary.
Thank you.

That if you ever need a personal reference from me...
That's what this is.
I'm afraid so.
I'm sure you know that we've been.
Going through some financial issues.
That we couldn't have foreseen last year.
And so we've had to look hard for cuts.
And unfortunately, the music ministry.
Is one of those areas.
That is unfortunate.
And since you were the last person hired in the department,
Well, you know the rest.
I do, actually.
Quite well.
May I ask you a question?
Of course.
Do you think gay marriage is wrong?
Because you knew I was gay when charity hired me,
So all this has got to be about reggie and I getting married.
I believe what the bible says about marriage.
And sexual immorality.
But what about what it says about love,
Or not sitting in the seat of the scornful,
Or being in judgement?
Listen.
Because I believe what the bible says.
Doesn't mean I don't love you.
It doesn't mean that I am sitting in judgement of you.
This is purely a financial decision.
For the record,
I don't believe you.
But I love you,
And I will pray for the broken part in you.
That has to believe that there is a broken part in me.
Thank you.
You're here.
Mama, I'm gonna fire him today.
I just did.
Your father's dallying I have to be patient with.
Yours?

Life's too short.
Really?
You know you not cooking that chicken this time.
Hey, reggie.
Pastor.
That's a nice car.
What can we do for you, pastor?
Can we talk?
Whatever you have to say,
You can say in front of him.
Look, I'm just sick about this.
Yeah, well, how do you think we feel?
Hey, baby... no, shorty...
It's all right.
We knew we were taking a risk getting married.
Been in the church my whole life.
I know my people.
They love you all week, as long as they can shove you back.
In that closet come sunday morning.
Don't worry.

But will you keep coming to church?
The only way to work on the church is to be in it.
Call you later, mama.
Don't leave like this.
I hear you.
This is a mistake.
He's still your father.
Gigi.

It's like in the hood,
But not the...

I guess my school commute will be shorter or something.
Facetime me so I can see it.
Okay.
Come on, kids.

See you, sweetie.
I love this little...

I got betty wilcox's pledge check.
Congratulations.
What's going on?

Off the record.
Are you gonna tell her the truth?
About what?
Why we made her wait so long to visit her grandson.
God has placed his goliath in our path, david.
Have you got the stones?
Son, you're being used.
One of my uncle's victims tried to killer herself.
Why isn't he in jail?
The fact that he's out there free...
Weighs on me.
Catch up with watch own and on demand.
