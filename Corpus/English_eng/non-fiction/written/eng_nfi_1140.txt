Previously on "Designated Survivor"...
- I am so glad to have you back.

Well, I'll try and do the job as well as you did.
Do better.
Tell me everything you know about that woman.
We'll find her, and we'll make her pay.
It's not gonna bring my son back.
Claudine Poyet.
That's her.
I hereby authorize you to use whatever means necessary to find the people involved in this conspiracy and bring them to justice.
Are you still up for this?
I haven't even gotten started yet.
Thank you.

Please, everyone, take your seats.
Good morning.
Good morning.
In the brief time I have been in office, we've experienced an extraordinary amount of tragedy together.
Today, however,
I'd like to ask you to join me in opening a new chapter in our history.
Most presidencies are judged by their first hundred days, when a president rolls out his policy initiatives for the next four years.
Circumstances denied us that initial opportunity, but I am hoping today, with your permission, to reset the clock.
I would like my first hundred days to begin now.
Over the coming weeks,
I will be announcing a broad agenda to address critical issues throughout the nation, issues that matter deeply to me...
How's he doing?
Twitter thinks he's crushing it.
...public education, healthcare, affordable housing, job creation, climate change, immigration, balancing the budget, and debt reduction.
Clearly, we have a lot of work to do.
I will be relying upon the leadership of both houses to work with me in a nonpartisan spirit, putting country before party, but I will also be relying upon the good will and highest ideals of the American people,
which is why I'll be holding a town-hall meeting this week at the college of William and Mary to begin what I hope will become a national discussion, as together we reset the clock...
- _ - ...and work to build a better America.
Thank you.
Now, I'm expecting that you have some questions.
Please.
Mr. President, you mentioned you want to start a new chapter.
Does that mean you're putting the fight against terrorists, like Al-Sakar, on the back burner?
Absolutely not...

Does it ever weird you out that you and Dad are, like... the President and the First Lady?
...responsibility to promote the general welfare...
Yes.

That is all we're doing here.
We're getting back to governing.
We have a responsibility to meet the needs of all Americans.
So, uh... how long were you planning to stay?
- Why, are you trying to get rid of me?

No, no, just the opposite.
I was thinking of getting you a better futon.
- That's all.

I'll probably only stay a couple days.
I just needed to be somewhere where nobody would think to find me, you know?
Right.
So you said you ran Claudine Poyet's photo through facial recognition?
Yeah, I thought Langdon's cellphone photo would give us a better hit than yours, but so far, nothing...

Ghosts are visions of the dead.
This woman is alive, and she has a name.
Yeah, well...
I could be a lot more impressive if, for once, you gave me more than just the hint of a sliver of a clue to work with.
Well, I wouldn't want to spoil you.
What about the timeline of her relationship with Langdon...
Retracing their steps?
Been there, done that, twice.
Chuck, what about fingerprints?
Yeah, that would be great if we had them.
Can you pull fingerprints off a photo?
The wine glass.
The resolution isn't exactly ready for prime time.
It's okay, just see what you can do.
- Amazing.

Run it through the IAFIS database.
Get me everything you can on her.
I know I've said this before, but I think it's worth repeating.
It's not that we don't care about hot-button issues.
It's just that we can't afford to get bogged down by controversy when Americans are worried about feeding their families or the price of chemotherapy.
Seth, I've got the staff director from the Senate Energy Committee.
He wants to know where the President stands on fuel cells.
Sure, tell him the President loved fuel cells 10 years ago, just like everybody else, but the technology hasn't advanced, so he'd like to stick to wind and solar.
Yes, we still think it's worth revisiting raising the minimum social security age.
There's a lot of support from the group,
- and we find...

Hi, this is Emily Rhodes, the White House Chief of Staff.
Who's this?

Social security will absolutely be addressed.
It just can't happen in the first hundred days.
Keep working on it, though.
Thank you.
Add social security to things we will address on day 101.
It kills me to run triage on issues that are actually affecting people's lives.
Well, we need momentum, and we're not gonna get it by being divisive right out of the gate.
Uh, folks, could I have your attention, please?
You know, if... if we waste the goodwill of the American people right now, the President doesn't stand a chance in Hell of getting anything done, okay?
Wow.
No pressure there.
Please, keep your seats.
Don't let me interrupt.
Hey, how's it going here?
Great, you hit it out of the park.
We're getting calls from Congress, special interests, R.P.s... real people.
People are excited to contribute to your new agenda.
Good.
The more public support we can build for you before the town hall, the better.
That way, we can use it to pressure Congress into supporting your agenda.

We don't have a chance in Hell.
Yeah.
Everyone, I'm sorry.
I know I said I didn't want to interrupt, but I'm the President of the United States, and I get to change my mind.
Franklin Delano Roosevelt passed 76 bills in his first hundred days.
If we can accomplish half of that...
Hell, a third...
Our government will be the phoenix rising from the ashes.
Keep it up.

Aaron Shore.

We can't pretend that anything is as it was before the Capitol was attacked.
The very fact that I'm standing here before you as First Lady should be proof enough of that.
But there are certain things that haven't changed.
When it comes to men and women, there are still two different standards for work-life balance.
And don't even get me started on the gender pay gap.
But it is my hope that as community leaders, as mentors, as mothers, daughters, partners, we can lead this country out of the ashes of tragedy and into a more enlightened future for all of us.
Thank you so much.
Before we lose you, we collected a few questions from the audience earlier, if you don't mind.
Um, certainly.
First question, "Do you miss practicing law?"
Absolutely, yes.
It was and is a huge part of who I am, but no complaints.
Public service is very much ingrained in both Tom and myself.
Next question...
"Considering our country recently witnessed two separate acts of gun violence...
The death of Vice President MacLeish, and the assassination attempt on your husband...
What are your views regarding gun policy in America?
Oh!
Honestly, this was something that deeply concerned me long before Tom and I ended up in the White House.
When something as simple as a mandatory background check can't get through Congress, then, honestly,
I-I have to wonder how we got here.
How do we tell our children that we are doing everything to keep them out of danger?
I-I don't know the answers to these questions, but I do know that we need to deal with guns differently in this country.
Thank you so much.
Jason.
The woman who killed Luke.
I don't want to talk about it.
I know who she is.
Brooke Mathison...

Seoul, South Korea...

Her father took a Pentagon post in the early '90s.
All we know is that he was charged with influence-peddling.
The case was dropped, but he was dishonorably discharged.
Her life tail-spinned after that.
She left home, but she pops up in various places throughout the country.
Five years ago... she disappears, erases any trace of her existence.
It's like she never was.
We know who she is.
What's next?
We know more than who she is.
We know where she is.
Chuck found an address.
I'm going after her myself, off the grid.
But I need backup.
You with me?
When something as simple as a mandatory background check can't get through Congress, then I have to wonder how we got here.
That was First Lady Alex Kirkman earlier this morning.
Right now, we have Montana Senator Jack Bowman,
Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, with us at the Hart Senate Office Building.
Thanks for joining us, Senator.
Pleasure.
Now, what do you make of the First Lady's comments?
Well, I have to say, I find it curious that on the same day the President announces his hundred days roll-out, the First Lady starts beating the drum for gun control.
Who's making policy here?

The President or the First Lady?
Emily.
- Hey.

Are you talking about the First Lady?
You heard?
I'm not sure it's so minor.
Mr. President.
I don't know if he's the kind of president...
What do we know about Jack Bowman?
He's the former Governor of Montana.
He resigned after the Capitol bombing so his successor could appoint him to the Senate.
Ambitious.
Highly...

Where does he stand on gun control?
Well, he's from Montana, sir.
Damn it!
I wanted to stay off of these third-rail issues.
And you're gonna have to if you want to keep your first hundred days alive.
Bowman wants to draw you out, make a national impression at your expense.
How do we stop him?
You have to talk to the First Lady.
Hey.

Oh, my God, Tom.

I so did not mean to step on your announcement.
It was an honest mistake.
Hell, it wasn't even a mistake.
I mean, you know I agree with you.
So, w-what's the problem?

Timing, perception...
Gun control is one of the most polarizing issues in the nation.
I just didn't want to start out of the gate with it.
What are Seth and Emily saying?
They think the best solution is for you to publicly walk back your comments.
What does that mean?
- Oh, you mean apologize?

You just need to make it clear that you were speaking for yourself, from your heart, and not on behalf of the administration.
You mean take a back seat.
I wouldn't put it like that.
I know.
Any stupid distraction like this right now could sideline your whole agenda.
Tell me, how do I... walk it back?
_
You have nothing to be nervous about.
Hey, you...
You're graduating from Penn with honors.
You interned at the White House last summer.
And I have a recommendation from my brilliant cousin.
Well, we'll see how much that's worth.
Congresswoman Yoshida.
You know, I like that new title.
We've come a long way since the Hill mailroom, haven't we?
Oh, indeed we have.
So I heard about your resignation.

It was all very amicable, believe me.
Congresswoman, this is my cousin Nadia Espinosa.
- A pleasure.

Impressive CV for someone your age.
Come on in.
Oh... and if I get you some more of that special Kona coffee that you like, will you tell me the real reason you left?
Maybe.
I-I'll think about it.
Okay.
Your girl is a classic sociopath.
Can't wait to get her into an interrogation room... see what makes her tick.
What the hell is wrong with you?

You don't know how to drive, huh?

- Jason!

- Hey!

He's just a reckless driver.

Get the hell out of here, you son of a bitch!
What was that?
Look, I shouldn't have...

Okay, I overreacted.
But I'm fine.
No, you're not.
I need a partner, not a loose cannon.
With everything that's going on, I just thought...
Oh, God.
I'm good.
I want to believe you.
I do.
But I can't take this chance right now.
We got too much riding on this, the both of us.
Hannah, I said I'm fine.

Get in the car.

What?
Jason, get in the car.
I'll walk.
Ja...
Reschedule that meeting.
Aaron?
Madam Speaker.
What are you doing here?
My cousin has an interview with the Congresswoman.
Oh, I didn't realize that politics was a family business.
No, no, it's not.
Can't be easy to be on the sidelines today.
The President's in very capable hands.
Listen...

Leaking that story to Abe Leonard.
Yeah, I appreciate that, ma'am.
I-It's not that simple, but thank you.
I know you and I have locked horns on occasion, but I've always respected you.
You'll land on your feet.
And if there's anything I can do, let me know...

Thank you, ma'am.
So how'd it go?
- Good...

Was that Speaker Hookstraten?
Chuck, it's me.
The place is completely cleared out.
I need you to look into the building records.
Find out who owns the property and any transaction history.
Hit me back when you've got something.
If it makes you feel any better, this is actually totally standard political procedure.
What, pretending to eat crow on national television while the rest of the nation's eating their breakfast?
Think of it this way.

How's it going?
I'll go see how close they are.
Okay.
You look great.
Tom, I look like a mannequin.
No, you don't.

Tom, I'm just no good at playing this, you know, submissive-wife role.
- No one's asking you to.

All I ask is that you acknowledge that the comments were yours and not that of the administration.
That's it.
They're ready.
Thank you.
Look...

Thank you.
Clearly, you're juggling a lot as first lady...
Wife, mother, spokesman, role model.
How do you keep it all together?
Um
I...

I mean, just yesterday, I managed to get in hot water for a comment I made at a luncheon.
Senator Jack Bowman of Montana accused you of soft-pedaling gun control on behalf of the President.
Is that what you were doing?
I gave a brief speech.
I was not expecting any questions.
And, um... when asked about gun violence, I simply spoke my mind.
So there was nothing premeditated?
No, not at all.
I spoke as a citizen, as a mother, not as a First Lady.
But I have discovered that when you are married to the President, you, uh... you don't really get to make that distinction.
So tackling gun reform is not something that you want to take on as First Lady.
Right now, I plan on leaving the politics to the new politician in my family.
And I know that both Tom and I are very excited about his agenda for the first hundred days.
D.C. was designed to intimidate, right?
It's working.
Come on.

You'll hear back from them any minute now.
I know.

So, are you ever gonna talk about it?
About what?
Why you left the White House?
Look, I know you don't do anything without good reason, but my mom said you were thinking about moving back to Texas, and I just want to say, for the record,
- it's a really bad idea...

It was a really good run.

It's time to try something new.
Can I just say one thing?
Now you're asking?
Before you, no one thought it was possible to get out of our town.
You probably don't remember this, but the summer after you graduated from college,
I was maybe 10, and you came home for a visit.
And the only thing you could talk about was moving to D.C. to work in the mailroom of some senator that nobody had ever heard of.
Yeah.
I'll never forget that you told me that it didn't matter that we came from nothing.
- Look, Nadia, just...

You were gonna prove that even we can make a difference.
That's why you came to D.C.
That's why I'm here.
Because of you.
_
_
Okay, that address you went to has been completely vacant for the past five years.
So it's a dead end.
Not necessarily.
Someone's still paying the property tax.
Who?
Browning Reed.
Browning Reed?

I thought they went out of business.
Supposedly, but it hasn't stopped them from shelling out $35,000 a year for an empty building.
Nice work, Chuck.
Find out whatever else you can on Browning Reed, and if they own any other properties in D.C.
I'm on it.
Do you smell that?
Yeah, there was a-a gas leak in the building earlier.
A guy from D.C. United Gas checked it out and said it was okay.
Chuck.
D.C. United doesn't check gas leaks.
The fire department does.
Out!

You okay?
I can't hear anything.
It'll come back.
Just breathe.
Hey.
We're okay.
Just a routine gas-leak explosion, right?
Right.
Right.
Listen...

So maybe we have the edge on them for once.
Somehow, that doesn't make me feel better.
The only connection we have is Browning Reed.
Did we find out if they own any other properties?
Thank God for the Cloud.
They own six properties in North Dakota.
- Anything closer?

Guess that's where I'm headed next.
Mr. President, my name is Carol.

I'm 74 years old, and I'm on a fixed income.
I've lived in the same apartment for 30 years, and because of gentrification,
I can't afford to live in my neighborhood anymore.
How are you going to help people like me from getting pushed out of our homes?
Carol, thank you for asking the question.
You're absolutely right.
Recent studies have shown that housing prices have gone up exponentially over the last three years, especially in our major cities.
I'm sorry, sir.

Emily, tell me whatever you want to tell me, but if you don't start talking to me like a person instead of the President of the United States,
- we're never gonna get through this.

You're falling into professor mode again.
Carol from Philadelphia doesn't give a damn about academic surveys.
She cares that she has to take two buses to find an affordable grocery store.
And she wants to know that you care about that, too.
I do, which is why I was referencing this study, because it shows that with specific zoning laws and small-business incentives, local grocers can...
No offense, sir, but I just fell asleep.
Look...

Focus on relating.
No, I don't feel comfortable with that.
The town hall isn't about me.
With all due respect, sir, yes, it is.
Okay.
You want me to show that I have a grasp on all of the topics, but not sound too professorial.
Yes... and personalize every answer.
And personalize every answer...

If you can get through tonight unscathed, we can get to policy building.
Okay.
This next question falls under the category of "expect the unexpected."
Mr. President, thanks to the Internet, pornography addiction has become a big problem in my community.
What are your thoughts on pornography, and how will you help with this problem?
You want me to personalize this one?
President Kirkman begins his town hall in just a few minutes.
What can we expect?
Well, it's his first public appearance away from the White House setting, and the idea is to bring his agenda directly to the people, to showcase the more personal side of Tom Kirkman.
And I'm eager to see if he can pull it off.
Thank you.
Mr. President.
My name is Melissa, and I wanted to ask what was it like becoming a president overnight?
That's a very difficult question for me to answer.
Over a thousand people died that evening, many of whom I knew.
Some I had talked to just that afternoon.
But if I'm gonna be completely honest... it was the scariest moment of my life.
But I knew I wanted to serve my country, and that's what I did.
And I'm committed to doing the best job possible.
Mr. President, we were all so worried about you after you were shot.
I'm surprised and elated to see you out and around so quickly.
How are you feeling?
Thank you.
Thank you all.
Thank you very much.
I'm feeling much better.

Seriously...

Hello, Mr. President, my name is Amy.
And my question to you, sir, is, after all that's happened these past few months, what do I tell my children?
Are we ever gonna be safe again?
That's a very important question, Amy.
If you don't mind, what are the names of your children?
Oh, Lily and Sara.
Lily and Sara.
I had a difficult time explaining this to my kids, too.
But I think you have to be honest with Lily and Sara and acknowledge what's happened.
And tell them that we're gonna get through this... together.
And when we do, we'll be better and stronger for it.
Mr. President, I was a factory worker for 27 years before the plant closed down last year.
I'm 54 years old, and I don't think
I have it in me to start a new career.
How you gonna bring back jobs like mine to Virginia?
What kind of factory did you work in?
I was an assembly-line foreman for a small-appliance manufacturer.
My father and grandfather were both factory workers.
I remember when I was a boy that...
I'm not here to speak about me.
I'm here to speak about you.
I'm very sorry that you lost your job, sir.
But as to what I can do to help bring it back, the answer is nothing.
It's gone for good.
And if some politician told you otherwise, they were lying to you.
And I won't do that.
Now, the reason why jobs like yours have disappeared isn't just because of cheaper labor in some other country.
Primarily, it's technology.
Technology allows one person to do what used to take 10.
Now, that might be great for the economy, but it's not for you... or your family.
Now, a moment ago, Melissa asked me what it was like to become president overnight, and I told her it was the scariest moment of my life.
It doesn't even compare to what you're going through, sir...
The fear of not knowing if you can provide for your family.
Not since the Industrial Revolution has our economy gone through such a dynamic transformation.
We need solutions.

We're gonna create a public-works program that's gonna deal with the failing infrastructure issues around the country, and anyone who has lost a manual-labor manufacturing job in the last four years because of this changing economy...
Their names will go to the top of the list for these new jobs.
But I also want to create programs at every public college and university across the country so unemployed workers can become educated in these new and emerging technologies.
And I want you to know that I believe that the American government has a responsibility, not just to maintain, but create opportunities for the American people, and that's what we're going to do.
Next question, please.
Hello, Mr. President.
- My name is Sandra.

I heard what the first lady said about background checks, and I have a question.
I recently lost my daughter, Julie.
My ex-boyfriend was... released from jail, and even so, he was able to buy a handgun from a private seller.
He broke into our house... and he shot and killed my little girl.
I'm so sorry.
My daughter was my world, my everything.
And the man... who took her from me was a monster who somehow still got his hands on a gun because unlicensed gun dealers don't have to run background checks.
I'm here because I have to be strong for my other two daughters.
But I struggle every day to find a reason to keep going.
I would like to ask you, Mr. President what will you do to prevent something like this from happening again?
Sandra, your story breaks my heart.
And as a father,
I can't even imagine what you're going through.
Gun control is one of the most divisive, hot-button topics in our nation, but that should not be an excuse for avoiding the issue.
In fact, that should be the opposite.
- He's good.

But I want to be absolutely clear.
I believe that the American people have every right to buy and own guns by virtue of the second amendment.
I would also like to take a moment to quash the myth that somehow gun control is equal to the Federal Government coming into your home and taking your weapons away.
Nobody is advocating for that.
We need to be doing everything we can to stop guns from falling into the hands of prior felons, people dealing with serious mental-health issues, people on terrorist watch lists.
I mean, come on.
We need to be using common sense.
It's as simple as that.
And I hate the fact that there is nothing I can say or do right now to ease Sandra's pain, but I can make her one promise...
That I will do everything in my power to make sure that not one more American family has to experience her grief.
Thank you.
Yes.
Aaron Shore is here to see you.
Send him in.
- Madam Speaker.

Thank you for seeing me.
Please.
Thanks.
So, what can I do for you?
I wanted to take you up on your offer.
You're good friends with Tony Buchanan, right?
I am.

I was wondering if you could make an introduction.
You want to work for Buchanan and Associates?
I've...

I-I like the causes they represent, their public-interest concerns, their non-profits.
Why do you want to be a lobbyist?
Well, when you leave a high White House position under a cloud, well, let's say your options are somewhat limited.
You didn't leave under a cloud.
I mean, I'll admit, it's a little mysterious, but there's no hint of scandal... is there?
No.
Okay, then.
Wouldn't you rather be on the inside?
Y-Yeah, but lobbying seems like a pretty good temp job.
Besides, the money wouldn't hurt.
That's the problem.
Once you get used to that expense account, it's hard to go back.
Yeah.
Washington needs you on the inside.
You're too talented to leave.
Look, um, I appreciate that, ma'am, but, um... can you think of any other alternatives?
Yeah.
Work for me.
Everybody, come on in.
That's it.

I want to thank you all for being here today.
Last night, I spoke to specific policy and ideas, but I want you to know that I am still trying to determine my own priorities.
So any input that you have, I would be grateful for.
There seem to be a few political pundits out there that think that I am working at a distinct disadvantage because I am registered as an Independent.
I can't tell you how strongly I disagree with that.
I believe that if we work together, we can create a bi-partisan platform that would be beneficial to both parties, and as an Independent, I can help facilitate that.
We have an opportunity to bypass special interests, lobbyists, and use... compassion, cooperation, common sense.
Now I'm not as naive as some of you would like to believe.
And I'm not trying to minimize or over-simplify the incredible challenges that we will face.
But as we begin our work here today,
I would like us to move toward the true spirit of partnership.
Now, having said that, I'll go first.
Senator Bowman... you and I have very different opinions on gun safety.
I would like to make a pledge to you, sir, that I will work tirelessly with you until we reach a consensus...
Something that we both can live with, maybe even be proud of.
Mr. President, you can rely on me to act in the best interests of the country.
Thank you, sir.
We had an amicable first meeting.
The President has some big ideas for the future, and so do we.
Now, the President made it clear last night and again today that gun control's an important issue to him.
We don't happen to see eye-to-eye on the topic, but in an effort to bring the issue out into the open, as the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee,
I will be re-introducing Bill 8180 from the former Congress, which strengthens federal background checks.
Now, I happen to oppose this bill, but in the spirit of bipartisan discussion,
I'd like to put it before the Senate for debate.
Do you believe this guy?
Son of a bitch.
We can't introduce our own bill now.
We do that, and we look like we're competing against Congress instead of working with them.
He hasn't even left the White House grounds.
Already he's hijacking our agenda.
If the President's gonna find a compromise, it comes at a price.
Good.

Yes, ma'am.
Okay, do we have anyone who can propose amendments?
Because this bill has loopholes you could fly a plane through.
Mr. President, we're just trying to figure out how to handle this development with Bowman.
I just read the bill.
I can see why it didn't get out of committee.
The problem is, if you don't support the bill, you'll be branded a hypocrite who used the town hall for political purposes when you're really soft on guns.
But if you do support it, you're opening yourself up to all sorts of criticism because of its flawed wording.
Son of a bitch is trying to back us into a corner.
Get ready for a fight.
How long you been following me?
Since the explosion.
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm ready now.
Let's go.
Browning Reed owns this place?
According to what Chuck found out.
Let her go.
Let her go!
Put your hands behind your head.
Put your hands behind your head!
Jason Atwood.
It's been a while.
Jason.
Jason, put your gun down.
Go get the car.

Yeah, Jason!
Let the real cop take it from here.
- Shut the hell up.

Jason, we'll make her pay for what she did, okay?
Do it.
Do it!
Damn it, Atwood!

Aah!
Let's take her in.
Hey!
Thank you.
- Aaron.

Hey, what are you doing here?
I'm meeting with Gary over at "Leg" Affairs.
It'll hit playbook tomorrow.
I'm the new Chief Strategist for the Speaker of the House.
You're working for Kimble Hookstraten?
I know, it seems a little outside the box.
A little?
She's the head of the Republican Party, and you're a card-carrying Democrat.
I'm looking to redefine the playing field.
I thought a lot about it, and with Kirkman as president, the party lines don't seem to mean as much as they used to,
- you know?

Well, I have a meeting with State.

I guess so.
Good.
Thank you.
Surprise!
Daddy!
I didn't know you were coming.
That's why they call it a surprise.
Is that from Zeno's?
Pepperoni and a veggie.
Awesome.
Wait up.
- This really is such a nice surprise.

They needed to see you.
No more than I needed to see all of you.
Long day.
I know...

Perfect example of why I never wanted to get into politics.
- And yet here we are.

Fighting the good fight.
We'll see.
You better not have eaten it all.

Oh, my God.
