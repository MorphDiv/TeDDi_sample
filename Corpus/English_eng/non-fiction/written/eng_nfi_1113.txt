The Germans seem close to an atomic bomb.
We have no option but to go in and raid Bringle Sands.
we can sabotage the rest.
You want me to get the King to Bringle Sands?
An American plane will fly His Majesty out to the Ark Royal but only if we can get the King there in time.
These are the atomic calculations.
Spode photographed them.
You're the safer pair of hands to get it to America.
Bernard Staines is dead.

if he talked?

I want you to stand ready as soon as I get Barbara Barga to you.
you are up to something.
Tomorrow morning you will be ready?
- For Bluejacket?

an ambulance is waiting.
The army will help you this one time.
Barbara?
DOOR CLOSES
apparently.
Yeah.
You ever thought this could all just be a set up?
Only every five minutes.
Come on.
Doug.
Your Majesty.
HE GASPS
HE GROANS
Archer?
for when the pain is too much.
All right.
sir?
Archer.
God save the King.

FOOTSTEPS APPROACH
Come with me.
GEARS GRIND
GRINDING CONTINUES
Doug?
I can't get it into gear.
That's all we bloody need.
Where's the nearest garage?
- GEARS GRIND.

We've got our work cut out to get there in time for the plane.
Wait here.
BANGING ON DOOR
DOOR OPENS
- Hello?

- Yes.

that would be quite delightful.
I don't know what is keeping Superintendent Archer.
But I know he's a friend of yours and I rather hoped he could... help us here.
Exactly why am I being held here?
That's obvious - for your own protection.
I'd rather be in the protection of the American Embassy.
The problem is you haven't behaved in accordance with our agreement with your government... specifically in your contacts with so-called Resistance fighters.
following a story.
My country is not at war with yours.
Miss Barga.
I think you are also an agent who wants to lure America into conflict with the Reich.
You're worrying about nothing.
Pick up any American newspaper and you'll see.
I'm ashamed.
Good.

That doesn't make me a spy.
No.
That makes you a challenge.
I don't know anything.
KNOCK ON DOOR
Well done.

Harry.
Thanks for bringing the car.
You can find your own way back?
I don't understand.
It's not really safe for you to be with us.
Or to know about this.
George.
Doug.
Your Majesty.
we've got to get going.
let me come with you.

Doug.

Let's not stand around here.
Come on.
I don't know what is going on between Herr Doktor Huth but I think you may be able to shed some light on it.
My government doesn't like its citizens being tortured.
my dear.
But if you answer my questions we won't have to engage one another in such... horrors.
Why did you burn the piece of film at your house?
What images did it contain?
I really don't want our friend here to damage such... ..fragrant skin.
I repeat...
What was in the images you destroyed?
Answer me!
PHONE RINGS
Ja?
Kellermann.
SS.

We can still turn round.
it's too late.
You and Sylvia get out and walk.
I'll meet you further round.

That's an order.
we can pretend to be lovers.
Don't get carried away.
Georgie.
sir.
Come on!

HE HONKS THE HORN
What's the matter?
Thank God.

We're not out of the building yet.
Have you heard from Douglas Archer?
nothing.
the raid is on.
Things are going to hot up.
The terms of your release are immediate deportation.
You're to be kept under armed guard at the Ambassador's Residence until you can be escorted straight to the aeroplane and flown back to Washington.
PHONE RINGS
Kellermann.
PHONE RINGS
that was a relief.
sir.

Your land.
sir.
I know a Hampshire song.
I bet you do.
Harry.

TYRE EXPLODES
AIR HISSES
Two hours to get the King to Bringle and we haven't got a bloody jack!
We're going to have to stop.

You have a hunt around.

I've not done this before.
Hold that.
I'm going to give you an injection for the pain.
It will make you feel better.
Thank you.
They mustn't see him.
Hello!
We hope you don't mind.

We'll be on our way as soon as we've fixed this.
Where are you heading?
Visiting friends near Dorchester.
Pal of ours isn't in the best of health.
Have you got some water?
You all want to come in?
We don't want to be any trouble.
Come through.
Thank you.
what with the light fading.
Yes.
What's wrong with your friend?
it's worse with old age.
Of course.
Friends in Dorchester?

but it's good to get out.
We've had some real pea soupers recently.
isn't it?
Margaret.
I'm Frank.
Alice.
- Are you married?

there you are.
That's David's brother.
will you?
Get some water from the well.
Sit yourselves down.
make some tea.

Do you want to see if your friends want some?
we wouldn't want you to waste your rations on us.
No problem. "Times like these." "Fellow man" and all that.
Yes.
SHE SCREAMS
GUNSHOT
GUNSHOT
I heard the shots.

They're bloody collaborators.
I thought their shelves were a little too well stocked.
Whoever it was was about to alert a German patrol that we're here and they'd have arrived before we had time to change that tyre.
- How long do you need?

we can't stay here.
Yeah.
What have you done?

Are there any other weapons?
- I've checked.

Handcuff her ankle to his wrist.
yes?
Someone has to do it!
Spying on villagers in return for a comfortable life?
Where are the car keys?
come on.
Doug.
Sir... we're here.
The airfield near the atomic research centre.
Shame nobody else is.
Burnham?
Archer?
Got anywhere warm we can take our guest?
The best we can offer is brandy and pheasant.
Any contact from Colonel Mayhew?
one hopes.
All right.
Most of the Auxiliary Units got blotted out in the first two weeks so Mayhew ordered the Resistance to hold fire.
Live to fight another day. or will be.
All we get are rumours.
sir?
risking their lives... do we have a hope?
A lot hinges on tonight.
I'd say.
it's Colonel Mayhew.
if you have one.
Archer here.
- Do you have Bluejacket?

Good man.
by the old control tower.
Best come as quickly as you can.
Let's get Bluejacket on his way.
What about the raid on the atomic research centre?
It's imminent.

let's go.
Operation's a go.
Where the hell is the plane?
Doug.

Danny.
I'll join you as soon as the King is dispatched.
Here's to merry hell.
Is everything all right?

Yes.
They're on their way.
there's the old control tower.
But where's Mayhew and the plane?
Harry.

HE MOANS
Sylvia?
Mayhew?
Mayhew!
Incoming!
German attack!
GUNSHOTS AND SHOUTING
Get the King out of here!

Go!

just go!

By what route were the scientists to get to the plane?
Get an army officer here and I'll answer.

HE CLICKS HIS FINGERS
Ah.

you are the only man here who could appreciate this place.
I'm not all that up on Georgian architecture.
Follow me.
The Georgian part - the facade and one wing - is from 1796.
this house is mainly Elizabethan.
I spent a few happy weekends here when I was up at Oxford.
And then I looked over the wall as we were passing and here it was.
presumably dead now. raven-haired and... a little wild.
she showed me... ..their priest hole.
LOCK CLICKS you see.
And being good Catholics... they put it to good use.
Let us find something we can drink this out of.

It was only when I saw you lying there that I realised who it was.
And who was the girl?
Sylvia.
I had no idea you were still...
But then it turns out I am easily deceived.
Mayhew played me like a fool.
I didn't know you knew him.
I had him squirming on the hook within days of arriving here.
I had a spy in the court of Von Ruff who reported their assignations.
I know.
Mayhew is a master.
He had me believing I had him in the vice.
Confessed to a plot to fly the top scientists out of Bringle Sands to America.
What made you believe he'd betray his own people? so he made a deal where he could hang on to most of his family's textile business in the north.
Selfishness is a motive I fully embrace.
He lied.

So you came down here to prevent the escape of the scientists.
Be the hero of the hour.
Mayhew just wanted me to cause a distraction while the real attack was launched.
I didn't see that coming.
Americans?
it's them.
Especially now with the research from Bringle.
It was Mayhew who killed Spode.
It was him who burned the papers.
He just didn't want the Americans to get the calculations too easily.
He wanted them to fight for it.
And to destroy any of the work that was completed at Bringle Sands.
of course.
Although perhaps he misjudged how important Spode's calculations were.
Their absence will cost the Americans time.
Standartenfuhrer.
It didn't take Kellermann long to seize his moment.
RADIO CHATTER IN GERMAN
Firing squads everywhere.
13 men shot in Swanage.
27 in East Lulworth. whether they have or not.
I wonder if the price is worth paying in Mayhew's book.
Any news on him?
But Kellermann is close.
What do you expect me to do?

I'm a lost cause.
twist things against me.
Can you believe he has already implied
I was involved in the Karl Marx bomb?
He'll keep his job and get rid of me.
We were all playing for high stakes.
you still have a chance.
for when Kellermann arrives.
I'll wager he has no proof you helped the King escape.
too.

You have a son to live for.
All I have is a father I hate.
The pig has won.
So have the army.
They can use the attack as a pretext for martial law across the entire occupied region now.
But the real winner is Mayhew.
He got the Americans fighting. they will build this bomb and the Reich will be finished.
Mayhew's only false step was allowing the King to get caught up in it.
That wasn't an accident.
The King was never meant to escape.
He was infirm.
He would have cut a pathetic figure in Washington or anywhere else.
Britain would have looked washed up.
in the same operation as brave Americans. the Queen and the Princesses will be on a ship from New Zealand for Washington to represent us.
That's the way Mayhew works.
The long game.
Hmm. how did you ever lose the war?
Perhaps we didn't.
Just the battle.
Does your son want to be a policeman?
Yes.
he does.
But on a motorcycle.
Archer.
Keep him out of this...

Douglas.
Think of him.
Priest hole.
That fool Kellermann wouldn't even know what one was.
HE COUGHS
SOLDIER SHOUTS ORDERS IN GERMAN
GUNFIRE
He's come round.
Where am I?
old pal.
You had a nasty little bullet down there that we took a dislike to.
How did I get here?
You're the only survivor we found.
It was a bloodbath.
What about Douglas Archer?
No sign of him.
you rest.
39 men unaccounted for. 8 serious casualties.
They're still compiling the list of Bringle personnel they now have on the ship with them.
Reporting the facility as totally destroyed.
Yes!

Incomplete.
Your flight's soon.

Miss Barga?
Miss Barga!
