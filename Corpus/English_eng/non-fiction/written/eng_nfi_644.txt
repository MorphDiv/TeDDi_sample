Today's the day you get your tiny house, right?
Yep.

Deb, I think it's so cool that you and Damien are reducing your carbon footprints.
Yeah, we don't give a crap about that.
We only bought a tiny house because we can't afford a real one.
But maybe literally being closer together will help improve our communication.
Get out of the way!
my life.
Oh, hey.

Deb had it delivered here by mistake.
Damien had it delivered here by mistake.
I need it gone today.
What happened to you?
You look like you slept in a bush.
Last night, I went down a weird wormhole of competitive tickling videos on the Internet.
Gonna have to wing it in class today.
Thanks for nothing, shit stick.
They can't pick it up till tomorrow.
At least you'll have a short commute.
That house is so small, it freaks me out.
Like little people or adult women wearing pigtails.
Typical Damien.

- he screws it up.

- doing these days?

Well, at least if he's not working, you have yourself a househusband.
If by that you mean a husband who lies around the house all day, then, yeah, I do.
He doesn't do anything to help out?
The way he sees it, I chill with kids all day,
Uh-uh.
Get off work at 3:00...
- No.

- a three-month vacation.

- Are you serious?

You should murder him.
Well, since you're living in the parking lot, maybe you can invite him into your class.
Then he'll see how hard you work.
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe today won't suck ass after all.
Hey, our plumbing's not hooked up and I had a Burrito Esplosivo last night.
So I gotta use your dumper.
Hey.
Great job cleaning up, guys.
Does anyone know where the green ring is?
Yes, Marcus?
On my penis.
What do you think a chin implant would do to my face?
- Oh, it'd probably help.

- Yeah, I think so.

- Oh.

Did another species go extinct?
Probably.

I thought it would be an opportunity for me to express my creative side.
But then I found out that no one respects art.
- Yeah.

- and putting it up on Etsy.

Sounds perfect for you.
No.

I haven't sold a single piece.
It's another rejection.
It's like the universe stepped in dog shit and is wiping it off on my life.
Oh, I'm sure your jewelry is beautiful.
Yeah, it's only a matter of time before people discover it.
Remember, Beyoncé wasn't built in a day.
Do you really think I should keep trying?
- Absolutely!

You know what?
I'm gonna give you both a pair.
- Jesus.

Would you look at those.
We can't take those for free.
Oh, my God.

I insist.
Okay, you know what?
Who needs a lesson plan?
I'm sure one of you smarties remembers what we're supposed to do today.
Huh?
Melinda?

You know, "Where the Red Fern Grows."
Really?

And we've all read it?
Good.

And of course I've read it.
I've read it a few times.
So let's jump right in.
Um, judging by the title of the book, one would assume it's a book about ferns.
No.

But really, this book is about...
Pablo, yeah.
A boy and his two dogs.
Great.

I'd never heard it before.
Does anyone remember what that name was?
- Melinda?

Billy.

Does everyone agree with that answer?
Great job, Melinda.

That's awesome.
Now, I want you to promise me that you will never put this down your pants again.
So I have to take off my pants if I want to put it over my penis?
No.

Ever again, for forever.
And let's not use that word.
- Penis?

Only doctors say that word.
If you say so.
- Hey.

I'm foraging.

Those are other teachers' lunches.
- Wha...

The great mystery revealed.

Mm, right.
I thought Spinoli was a pasta.
No, he teaches special ed.
- Hey, guys.

Why aren't you wearing my earrings?
I, uh... just hadn't gotten around to putting them in.
Yes, and I am saving mine for a special occasion.
In the future.
Oh my God.

No, they just didn't go with what we're wearing, and we can't afford any more of your earrings.
Oh, well, in that case, they're free.
This is good advertising for me.
Now you can pick out the ones that match all your outfits.
That's amazing.
There's nothing to stop us from wearing them now.
Today we're gonna be talking about classifying parallelograms.
Let's review.

Fisher, we haven't heard from you recently.
Why do we have to know this stuff?
Because it's part of geometry.
Uh, excuse me.

Right, little man?
Well, for one, he can use it to pass the test when we're done
- with the chapter.

They're gonna succeed by following their passion.
Like me and my music.
- Are you serious right now?

I never learned what a perilgram was, and it didn't hurt me.
I'll tell you something that did hurt me, though.
A bunch of teachers who didn't respect me for what I really wanted to do in life, which is shred on my axe!
Man, they just reward you for following their rules.
But you know what?

Total, nonstop jamming.
I got a van with carpeting on the walls.
I started my own band.
I hooked up with your hottie teacher because she dug those sweet riffs.
It all comes down to one dope mantra:
reject authority; break the rules;
do what you love!
Yeah!
- Yeah!

Whoa!

Now I get why you like teaching so much.
They were supposed to be learning about parallelograms!
I thought that was what teaching is all about.
You start teaching one thing, but then you go with the flow.
And then you're teaching something else.
Oh, like that school is completely useless.
- Hey, you said it, not me.

Whoa.

- in the classroom.

Which, thanks to you, is in the parking lot!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

- Oh, my God.

Thank you, Damien.
I cannot run with these stupid earrings.
De nada, señorita
Well, I would love to stay and chat, but we have to get back to class.
We're doing a unit on the Mayans, which was forever ago.
- So boring.

I was in this drone metal band called The Servants of Kukulkan, so I know a ton about 'em.
Really?
And so in order for the Mayans to keep everything chill with their gods, the high priest would reach into the sacrificial victim's open, bloody chest cavity...
Ahh.
And pull out his still beating heart.
Ohh.
But wait.

Why would Old Dan keep barking up that tree if the ghost coon wasn't even there...
I remember asking myself when I read the book.
But the answer is...

Little Ann smelled the raccoon in the air.
Are you kidding me?
You can't get anything past Little Ann, okay?
This is amazing.

Again.
Very good, Tiffany.
Balloon.
Your handwriting is really improving.
Where are the Os in "balloon"?
They were just right here.
- Do I have to?

There are two Os in "balloon," Marcus.
You promised me that you would never, ever do that again.
No, I promised not to use the green ring.
There's a lot of other things I can use, though.
Okay, everyone.
We're gonna play a very fun game.
I want you all to find anything that has a hole in it and throw it in the garbage!
Ms. Watson needs an adult!
I'm sorry, buddy.

What about you?
Oh, yeah.

I was rearranging the desks when my hideous earring got caught.
Got it.

Want me to, uh, put these desks back in rows?
Thank you.

Old Dan and Little Ann are the toughest dogs in the world!
Yeah!
If you can fight a mountain lion, you can survive anything!
Yeah.
But Dan doesn't survive.
What?
The mountain lion cuts him up all over.
On the walk home, his intestines get caught on a bush.
Billy, like, has to push them back inside.
Then Dan dies back at the cabin.
Dan's dead?
It wasn't fast.
Does everyone agree with this answer?
Mm-hmm.
These things are gonna permanently distend my earlobe.
Ew, I'm gonna look like I'm from Portland.
Cecelia?
What are you doing?

My muses.

Oh, my God.
We are wearing literal garbage.
You have a half-sucked cough drop on your ear.
Oh, my God!
Oh, God.

I don't know.

Did you stay out late again last night?
No.

Yesterday I found out that Old Dan died.
Is that the homeless guy that used to bury his poop like a cat in the sandbox?
No.

I didn't even see it coming.
Neither did Old Dan.
Hey, Deb.

It sucked.
Turns out a tiny house is a lousy place to sleep when you're having murder fantasies about your husband.

- in my class yesterday.

He jumped right in.

Look!

And he doesn't respect what I do.
And as my friends, you're supposed to hate him for me.
That's Girlfriend 101.
I don't want any of you hanging out with him anymore.
- He's dead to me.

As a Christian, I love him, but as your girlfriend,
- I will shun him.

I'll just go back to judging him by his appearance.
Good morning, my little learning lemurs.
Today we're going to practice how to tell time.
Where's my doughnut?
No.

Ms. Feldman?
Are we gonna finish talking about the book today?
Okay.

Who knows what happened after Old Dan passes away?
The other dog dies of grief and starvation.
Little Ann dies?
Both dogs die?
- I gotta go.

Yeah, I just got glass in both my eyes.
Feldman, what's wrong?
- I can't talk to you, man.

I got nothing but time.
I just found out both dogs die in "Where the Red Fern Grows."
- Ohh.

Yeah, and I read that one for my GED prep class.
It really got me too, until I realized the whole thing about the red fern.
- What about it?

Here.
It's like the whole point of the book.
The red fern represents the memory of the dogs, which is gonna live on forever.
But they're dead.
Are they?

And so did millions of other people.
Wow.

So you're gonna be okay?
Yeah, I just want to move on to our next book.
- It looks like a lot of fun.

- "Old Yeller."

Oh, really?
- Chicks before dicks.

You can't be here.
We can't be seen together in public.
Just go.

- Maybe I can help.

How could it be so wrong when it feels so right?
- I assume you can be discreet.

Come with me.
So I hear you've been putting round things
- over your penis.

Dude, I totally get it.
When I was your age,
I used to stick my wang everywhere, anywhere it would fit.
But it's starting to bum Ms. Bennigan out.
- And we don't want that, right?

So I was thinking that maybe instead, you just put round things over your penis in private.
- Okay.

Yeah.
Rock and roll.
Yeah, so, uh, gimme a call sometime.
Let me know how it goes with Marcus.
I can't do that.

You've been wonderful.

It's just not right.
Mary Louise, what are you doing?
We're supposed to be shunning him.
- What?

Why do you guys have that stuff hanging from your ears?
We're wearing them out of pity.
Cecelia made us these earrings out of garbage.
I know.

Penis?
We're wearing penis jewelry?
Cecelia, there's not an easy way to tell you this, but...
We love you, but there comes a time when honesty is the best...
Whoa-ho-ho!
These are some radical Christmas ornaments, man.
Oh, my mom is, like, a Christmas maniac.
- Oh.

Oh, they're not Christmas ornaments.
- Really?

Yes!

Oh, shit!

No!
Stupid Damien!
My mom is a recycling freak.
And I'm not allowed to bring anything new into the house.
Oh, they're made from repurposed refuse!
You're kidding.
- Really?

- I'll buy all of 'em!

- Yes!

- Take mine.

I love these, but it would look
- so much better on a tree.

Yeah, so we were doing buttery nipple shots and you guys know what those are, right?
- Yeah.

Oh, my God!
- You can't even tell!

- Oh, my God.

I didn't mean to let him help me, Deb.
It just happened.
Get out.
Okay.
What the is all this trash?
Why is it that you can help everyone but me?
It never seemed like you need any help.
You do everything.
You're like super Wiccan.
No, Damien.

- I need help all the time.

Yeah, you just never offer it.
When I get home at the end of the day, I'm exhausted.
I get it.

I'm sorry I said it was an easy job.
- It's not.

Maybe I can be a little bit more helpful.
That would be great.
Oh, oh.

Oh, yeah!

- Oh, it's so tiny!

- Oh, no, the house, the house!

- The house...

Yes, it's hurting!
Oh no, Chelsea.
Don't say a word, it is my cheat day.
This is so good.
