Why is it that nothing beneath the skin sounds remotely the way it looks?
I tell you, all of human anatomy is its own Byzantine recherché.
Sorry, you were saying?
I have cut off more limbs than any other doctor in this war, and yet, I am forced to pass an exam given to me by a bunch of inkhorn surgeons.
Well, you've been at the books day and night, so--
My knife is guided by touch and feel, not some military manual.
McBurney has my brain in a pinch.
You hope to assume her position.
I resent the implication.
Still, you stand to benefit from her misfortunes.
Miss Phinney succumbed to an illness not a coup d'etat.
Therefore, my own advancement hangs in the balance, as does yours.
And yet, I remain fully composed.

Major McBurney has his job to do.
We have ours.
And what if I lose mine, hmm?
Byron, do not so easily fall prey to your own anxieties.
Miss Hastings, the Major would like to see you at once--
"At once?" Is that his words precisely?
Good "At once" or bad "At once?"
I-I couldn't say, Miss.
That woman is wound tighter than a 10-day clock.
Come with me, Samuel.
Our transfemoral expired last night.
Seems awful sudden, sir.

Sometimes a feeble disposition is the only culprit.

Those men won't last much longer.

Let's find you a bed.
Miss Hastings, I rather pride myself
But that is not why I was dispatched to this hospital.
Well, obviously.
It is my administrative skills that were most needed here.
As such, I find it simply unconscionable that one tart should have three peach slices and the other 11.
11!
Surely you see the slippery slope.
Today, peaches.
Tomorrow, vital life-saving medical supplies.
How can a hospital properly function if it can't even count its peaches?
Let us not answer my question with your questions.
Any prospective head nurse would not tolerate such imprecision.
Sir, in my defense, the tart, as with all matters of nutrition, falls to the kitchen staff.
Well, now it falls to you.
Henceforth, I will expect all tart fruits to be notated by type and quantity.
I expect two peach tarts of exact and equal composition on my desk by 5:00.

Your work is at the bedside, Chaplain, not on the battlefield.
What will become of us if we are each doing a job other than our own?
If the artillery men cooked and the cooks fired the artillery, this war would be lost in a week!
Is that my sole purpose in this war?
God's word brings the men peace.
Or brings me peace.
Gives me the illusion that I'm actually doing something to help these men.
I'll rescue them myself.
