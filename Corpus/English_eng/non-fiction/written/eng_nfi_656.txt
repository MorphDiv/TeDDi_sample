[NARRATOR] The walls stood for a century.
A bastion of peace and security.
Gone was the terror of living at their mercy.
Mankind had acclimated to living like cattle.
Then... ♪♪ Intense music plays... ♪♪
[NARRATOR] The Titans breached what we'd long taken for granted.
The fight for humanity's survival began.
Death reigned, claiming soldiers and civilians alike.
The casualties were staggering.
Staggering, too, was the hard-won knowledge that Titans were hiding among our own.
Five years after the first wall fell, we successfully captured one of these treacherous creatures alive.
[NARRATOR] And yet, even as the smoke of battle cleared, the next threat was already close at hand.
[SOLDIERS gasp]
What the...?
[MALE SOLDIER 26A] Wh-What is that?
[MALE SOLDIER 26B] It's a Titan!
[MALE SOLDIER 26C gasps] In the wall?
[MALE SOLDIER 26D] Impossible!
[HANGE, MOBLIT gasp]
Section Commander, your orders?
[HANGE] Is, is this just a coincidence, or...?
[gasps] [panting]
[HANGE] Pastor Nick?
[NICK] Listen to me.
Whatever else you do, don't let sunlight touch it!
Mm.
*ATTACK ON TITAN* Season 02 Episode 01 "Beast Titan"
♪♪ Opening theme song, sung in Japanese... ♪♪
[MALE SOLDIER 26E] For the time being, we've covered the Wall Titan with sheets.
It seems to be holding up.
Further measures will be taken after sundown, commander.
Understood.
[MALE SOLDIER 26E] Forgive me, sir, but what are we supposed to make of all this?
I mean, I never imagined there could be
Titans inside the walls.
There are only those who knew and those of us completely in the dark.
Why are they keeping quiet about this?
It's an earth-shattering discovery for god's sake.
What's the point of playing it off?
Status quo, right?
Yeah, higher ups play it close to the vest.
All this carnage, and they couldn't even be bothered to come up with a decent cover story.
[HANGE] All right.
You wanna tell me what's going on?
[MOBLIT grunts]
What on Earth's the point of having one hidden inside the wall?
And why choose to keep it a secret?
I need answers, and I'm gonna need them right now.
[NICK sighs]
I don't have time for this nonsense.
Let me down from here this instant!
If that's what you want.
[groans]
[HANGE] Will straight down do the trick?
[NICK cries out]
Let me ask you something.
Do you have any concept of how many Scouts have laid down their lives fighting these monsters?
More than you can count!
They died fighting for your freedom!
I was with them!
I was willing to lay down my own life!
Now, you can explain, or you take the plunge.
[HANGE] That's kind of what I had in mind.
Do it!
Don't try to call my bluff.
Please, don't!
You think I'm afraid to die in the service of my belief?
We fulfill our duty whatever the cost!
Let his humble servant fall!
Lord, grant release.
[HANGE grunts] [NICK groans]
[HANGE chuckles]
[breathes quaveringly]
Are all the walls made of Titans?
At least tell me that much.
Section Commander.
Talk about terrifying.
[bell rings] [gasps]
Hyah!
The Titans have breached Wall Rose!
[bell continues ringing]
Y'know, my village happens to be just a little bit south of where we are now.
[CONNY sighs]
Why can't I go see my people?
Maybe I'll just sneak out after dark.
I was too puny to be a soldier.
No question I had the brains for it.
I was top ten in my class, actually.
Somebody's gonna be eatin' their words, that's a promise.
Conny, I'll help you if you really wanna go.
Doesn't this feel a bit strange?
We're on standby in our plain clothes.
They won't let us wear our uniforms.
We can't even train.
What's even more suspicious:
our superiors are armed to the teeth.
We're inside the wall, not at the front line.
So who exactly are we fighting?
[sighs] I don't know, man.
Maybe they're worried about bears.
[REINER] All you need for bears are guns.
[SASHA groans]
[gasps]
What?
Knock if off, Sasha.
So what, you're trying to tell us Titans are here?
Come on, that would only be possible if Wall Rose had fallen.
[MICHE inhales sharply]
What is it, Miche?
[gasps]
Notify the districts.
[MICHE] The odds of there being any Titans hiding in the hundred and forth Cadet Corp are low.
We've got multiple Titans incoming from the south!
Wall Rose has been compromised!
[window squeaks]
[NANABA] Is everyone here?
What it is, Nanaba?
We've got company.
Approximately 500 meters to the south and closing.
There's no time to suit up with your ODM gear.
I want everyone on a horse STAT.
Evacuate every home and settlement in the area.
Get to it.
Do we know if the wall's really been breached?
Miche.
[NANABA] They must've broken through Wall Rose.
Now, it's too late.
Remember that.
As long as we keep putting up a fight, we haven't been beaten!
[MICHE] The second the Titans reach the woods, we'll split up.
I want four separate teams.
Recruits and soldiers alike in each unit.
When I give the signal, we'll scatter in different directions simultaneously.
Get the word out to civilians.
Do not engage the enemy!
Which one of you is most familiar with the area?
Uh, me!
Sir, my home town's just to the north of here!
I know this region like the back of my hand!
What's wrong?
My village.
My village is to the south.
That's where the Titans are coming from.
Very well.
Guide the southern team, then go to your village.
Yes, sir!
I'll come with you.
They'll be everywhere.
You think I care?
I was gonna help you get home anyway, wasn't I?
[NANABA] As you have guessed, today marks the darkest hour in humanity's history!
[GELGAR] They've reached the woods!
The enemy is on top of us!
[MICHE] Scatter, now!
Ride for everything you're worth!
[MICHE] Gelgar!
Take charge of the southern team!
[GELGAR] Sir?
Uh, understood.
[FEMALE SOLDIER 26B] Tell me he's not using himself as bait!
Stay where you are!
We can't spare any more soldiers!
Give him some credit.
That man's skills are second only to Captain Levi.
[bellows]
Yeah, well, I'm not the one who started it this time!
Those jerks were making fun of me!
Thank you, dear.
[CARLA] Eren, we don't throw punches at everyone who's mean to us.
Being an adult means learning how to pick your battles.
You want them to think that you're strong?
Exercise restraint.
Try protecting Mikasa once in a while.
[EREN groans softly]
[MIKASA exhales]
[MIKASA] Oh.
[EREN] That thing's seen better days.
I'll grab you a new one if I can find any with the supplies.
They've broken through Wall Rose!
[door knob clicks]
[ERWIN] Can you go?
Like there's a choice.
If I may say so, sir, very wise leaving Miche in charge of the hundred and fourth.
If anyone can handle the situation, he can.
Yes.
Let's hope so.
[breathes deeply]
[MICHE] Only four of them left.
I've bought us more than enough time.
[whistles]
Look at the bastard.
And this is the first time I've ever seen one of them covered with, what, fur?
It's just lumbering around.
Why doesn't it try to rush me?
Definitely an Abnormal, but...
[HORSE 26A neighs] [MICHE gasps]
Looks like I won't have to hold out for sundown after all.
[HORSE 26A whinnies]
Aw, come on!
[HORSE 26A whinnies]
[MICHE grunts] [groans]
[yells]
[DEEP VOICE] Wait.
[MICHE groans]
[squelch] [MICHE groans]
[panting] [gasps]
May I ask what you call that strange weapon of yours?
[gasps]
The thing attached to your waist that allows you to fly.
[gasps, stammers]
Perhaps you're too frightened to formulate a response?
I notice you also use swords.
Fascinating.
Must mean you know we reside in the nape.
Ah, well.
Suppose I'll just take it back with me.
[MICHE screams]
[clink] [MICHE gasps]
[breathes heavily]
As long as we keep putting up a fight.
[MICHE] As long as we keep putting up a fight, we haven't been beaten!
[bellows]
[BEAST TITAN] Huh?
[yells]
[screams]
Ah, so you do know how to speak.
[MICHE groans, screams]
Ah, an exceptionally clever idea, I must say.
[MICHE screams] [squelch]
