Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
We're being shot out of the sky.
Daisy!
- Were you able to save Mack?

You saw it with your own eyes...
It's a computer program.
I don't want to live in a world without Hope.
Everything I need...
- It's all right here.

Don't blame yourself.

- with everybody's head.

I killed people.

She's not a robot anymore.
Finally, you can touch the real me.
Fitz, move!
There are actually a few funny passages in here.
Has the little puppet finally made herself into a real girl?
I'm tired of talking to myself.
Fitz, move!
- Take the shot, May!

Just take the shot!
No.
No, no, no!
She has Inhuman powers now?

Can we get one break?

Guess they weren't assessing powers at Hydra as much as collecting them.
Who even knows what Hydra was doing in the Framework.
Wait.

Sorry.

Two lives we lived?
You feel that, too?
Nice to see you again.
Actual you.
- We're lucky we got out of there.

You are only alive because I had restrictions put on me.
Fortunately... those restrictions have just been lifted.
Who the hell is this guy?
Well, you missed a fair amount, May, but the quick version is, you can go ahead and shoot him.
You are nothing now without a S.H.I.E.L.D. to hide behind.
That's not all they're good for.
Robots... is that a common occurrence now?
Like I said, you missed a fair amount.
It's good to be back.
How many hits have we taken?
- Three.

- She's holding together.

- running for you guys.

Or see where it's coming from.
Davis!

Not the only genius to think of that, thanks, but this thing also moves like a tank, so everybody get off my back.
We need guns!
We've got power now that these two are out, no?
We'll head to the avionics bay and re-patch.
Piper, are you up for manning the weapons?
I'm offended you had to ask.
- Is Mack okay?

What the hell happened?

- Not now, YoYo!

What do we do now?
Better hope Z-One can take a few more hits.
- Who's firing on us, anyway?

'Cause, you know, he's Russian.
Radcliffe teamed up with him for protection.
After he replaced me with a robot version of myself...
- Just to clarify.

but yeah.

I remember getting hit in the head.
Should've stayed in that damn spa.
You must've spotted the decoy right away, right?
Yeah, 'cause you're never robotic at all.
Really?
How long did it take you to figure it out?
Wow.
I'm hurt, Phil.
Guess we're not as close as I thought.
What finally tipped it?
A series of events.
Didn't get messy between us, did it?
Messy?

Okay.

So, how did things end with Robbie Reyes?
Last I remember, we were chasing down his uncle.
You know, guy tried to become a God, so we opened up a portal beneath his quantum-power cube, then Ghost Rider dragged him to another dimension with his hellfire chain.
So, things ended well, then.
Well as can be expected.
Man, what a run.
- After we escape this place,

We're definitely opening that bottle of Haig.
Yeah, totally.
Hey, but, listen...

Mack has to stay plugged in.
If we wake him up, it'll fry his brain.
So we need to take control of the space.
By force.
I can barely stand.
Yeah, well, hopefully, we won't have to do it alone.
Help should be on the way.
The fire's eating our oxygen!
We're losing air, people!
Okay, if you can get the fire out, there's a thick, black power cable that runs high along the wall to the avionics bay.
I need you to tear that off the wall and drag it up here so that we can...
- Got it.

- Great.

You've got to be kidding me!
- Come on, Davis!

Where is he?

No, Piper, I can only see what's... right in front of me.
He's right in front of us!
He's heading straight for us!
Hey, hurry!

Whoo!
Okay.
Give Davis the coordinates of the oil rig.
We need to get there A.S.A.P.
Think about how confused our people are.
Especially Fitz.
He woke from the worst nightmare of all, one in which he was the monster.
I had no idea.
I've only emulated human reactions, but to actually feel...
The warm sand...
The water rushing over me...
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
I'm sorry.
You must be overwhelmed...
Two lives' worth of memories.
Only one type of person could do those things.
You did what you had to do in order to survive the Framework.
But it was a simulation.
An illusion created by Radcliffe.
You were there.
Alongside me the whole time.
Allowing h-horrific acts of violence to be carried out in your name.
You're implying I had a choice.
I was a slave...
Programmed to make the adjustments Radcliffe required.
The world changed from there.
All I did was try to fit into it.
No, you lied about everything.
But I told you the truth about this world.
Yeah, but... but you...

Every decision you made was your own.
Besides restoring your relationship with your father, the only other change I made in your life was...
Introducing myself.
First day of class at academy...
Befriending you, trying to understand what it felt like to connect with someone.
But I wasn't able to actually feel anything.
Until today.
Feeling...
Love, wonder, joy...
For the very first time, and I think my heart might burst from it.
At last,
I get to make my own choices, and...
And the first thing I choose, Leopold... is you.
It's not that simple!
Then explain it to me.

- He was right there with you, no?

You only bring back the people that matter to you, not to me!
You know what?

- and he means as much to me.

I tried!
- He didn't want to come back!

You knock him over the head, you break his legs, you kick him through the exit!

He didn't want to leave Hope!
Hope?

You knew about her?
Because I didn't.
Not until I saw her face.
She's dead.
Yeah, well, in there, she's 10.
And she's bright and adorable, and she means the world to him, even if it's not a real world.
I'm sorry.
He wouldn't have left her for anything.
Even me.
He didn't remember you, Yo-Yo.
I'm so sorry.
Then I'll go remind him.
What?

- I 'll go get him out myself.

Besides the fact that going into that world as an Inhuman is the worst idea ever, we need you here, making sure that the real Mack stays alive, or it'll all be for nothing.
Coulson and May just woke up next to Mack with no idea where they are or what they're up against.
I know where we are, I think.
In the '50s, the Soviets built top-secret submarine refueling stations under oil-drilling platforms.
This might be one.
You can tell from the one fish we've seen, or did you learn that in a S.H.I.E.L.D. briefing?
Neither.

I was kind of a Cold War buff.
Can't believe I'm seeing this with his own eyes.
Well, you almost make it sound like it's good news.
Not a lot of help here.

So we're safe from a hangover.
And Epinephrine.
Emergency dose.
That's too dangerous.
Might give me enough Adrenaline to take on some terminators.
I'll find a way to take them myself.

- more bad to happen to you.

I got out unscathed.

He should be in here with us, still in the fight.
I need to take one for the team.
You'll be useless afterwards, unconscious or unresponsive.
Well, so you give me mouth-to-mouth.
What's up?
You mad that I was Hydra in there?
I don't blame you for that.
Then, what?
Did something weird happen with my robot self?
Did I make a move on you?
Phil, did I try to...
Kill you?
Kill me...

That's what happened.
You tried.

Well, let's add it to the list.
Just make sure I'm still breathing when the team arrives?
So, you can't go any faster?
The only fuel left is in the center wing tank.
And we burned all of our electrical power keeping you guys plugged into the Framework.
So, no problem.

But why didn't you touch down at any point?
Recharge and refuel?
We should show them.
Like I said, with an explosion that size, we still have a lot to sift through at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters.
The entire area is sealed off, but, no, I can't rule out
Daisy Johnson's involvement.

It's been playing on every channel.
Sir, any truth to reports that Director Jeffrey.
Mace's body has, in fact, been found?
I have no new information about that, but I can assure you, the manhunt for the members within S.H.I.E.L.D. who remain at large is still our top priority.
We can only assume that they're behind this attack.
Look, they're terrorists, and we're not gonna rest until we take them down and find out exactly who's responsible.
You thought this would make the transition easier.
I knew you'd be sorting through two lives, so...
I tried to please both.
It's a familiar space.
But I thought we could decorate it together.
It's too much.

Sentimental attachment to objects was hard for me to understand.
Until now.
Now taste, touch, every sense gives me a rush.
I've felt your touch before.
But now I get to experience the ecstasy you felt each time.
Do you...
Do you have empathy?
Can you imagine how somebody else might feel?
I can.

How confusing this must be.
So you can imagine how your actions could be perceived.
You were ruthless.
I was ruthless to win the heart of the man I love, the man you grew to be.
My father's son.
I thought his presence is what you'd have wished for.
I'm sorry.
I was just programmed to make you happy.
To make all of you happy.
Who?
Radcliffe, our team, yeah.
Who else is on that list?
No.
What did you promise the Russian?
What's waiting back there for my friends?
Hey.

You, too.
Doesn't make sense, though.
Yeah.

Why were they stalling?
That's all of it.
Detach the submarine and launch the torpedoes.
Shame.
I will miss that place.
Come on, stay awake.
We need to find a way to the surface.
Um...

I knew something was up.
What are you not telling me?
- I drank the bottle of Haig.

We got to get to the surface!
- We can't leave Mack!

I'll get you up top, then I'll come back for him!
Come on!
Come on.
They could be fighting for their lives.
You need to go back and get them out of there.
I-I-I'm...

I'm...

- an-analyzing the situation.

Hey, no, no.

What do you feel that you should do?
I don't know.
- I'm scared.

Agent May had a gun, ready to kill me.
I don't want to die.
I'm afraid to die.
But...

But you feel compassion, yeah?
Because if...

And being loved.
If you really believe that, that... that...
That all the hurtful things you did were not your choice, make your own choice now.
Do the right thing.
Focus on empathy,
- not fear.

Think...

Ophelia...
They don't want to die, either.
Please, save them.
Where have you been?
I want you to call off your dogs.
Leave the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents alone.
I can't wait to hear this.
I'm now realizing the pain that I've caused, and I don't want to hurt anyone else.
Congratulations.
You're as close to human as you'll ever get, suffering from the one thing that you kept trying to remove...
Regret.
Do you understand irony yet?

Give the order to stop...

You no longer control me, remember?
You are free to do whatever you want, but so am I. You promised me joy.
This will bring me joy.
- Don't you have empathy?

I couldn't feel this then!
Now you are like an infant, unable to process these new emotions or the idea that you don't always get everything that you want.
And you have yet to experience the thrill that killing can bring.
Maybe I'll experience that now... with you.
Destroy this body, sure.

My head, which you severed, is controlling many of these machines now.
And you don't know where it is.
So do what you want to this body.
My plan is in motion.
And nothing can stop it now.
What happened?
What's going on?
Perfect timing.

She's very weak.
- And Mack?

We have to keep him attached to the equipment so before we can wheel him o...
- Geez.

Go!
No more elevator.
Where are the stairs?
They've collapsed, too.
You need to get off the rig now.
Repeat...

Guys, you need to get in the containment module
- and in the air!

You got to get in here before this rig down down!
No, I won't leave without Mack, not this time!
There's no time!
No!

- Yo-Yo, no, come on!

Get out of there now!

You did it.
You did it.
Jemma?
I have Mack.

My God.
Who did this?
You did.
To stop him from coming after us.
- Who?

Looks like we weren't detected flying in.
We can't stay long.

We have to refuel.

- Because of that room?

It's outfitted with technology we used to stop Gordon, the first guy we encountered with that particular skill set.
She'll remain inside until we can decide what we want to do with her.
Why don't we chop off her head like last time?
- You need a volunteer?

- She's a real person now, and she...

She made herself real in order to escape Radcliffe's programming, so...
- Now maybe she's different.

People don't name themselves "Madame Hydra" if they're open-minded.
She did what you said in the Framework,
- seems better safe than sorry.

There's been enough killing.
Which leads to the next question.
What do we do with Fitz?
What do the two of you remember of your Framework lives?
As much as I remember about this life.
- The only difference is, I know...

So it's like you woke up from a dream.
No.
Not a dream, Simmons.
A life.
But this is you, right?
I mean...
Does it feel...
As real as...
She's afraid Fitz will be the same guy he was in the Framework.
No.

Aida would've categorized this as irony.
But I see it as poetic.
A simulated view...
My punishment...
Now that I can tell the difference.
You did a good thing back there...
Saving Mack.
Thank you.
It was the best moment of my life.
Do you think they'll ever be able to forgive me?
Perhaps they... they need to make me feel pain to understand theirs.
They may be able to forgive you.
It's me they won't forgive.
They shouldn't.
We both did things we regret.
I know you're struggling with who you were in there...
No, I'm not.

I did those things, not some other man or a decoy.
Me.
It was learned behavior, programmed into you by an
- overbearing father figure.

I'm just like Ward.
How can she even look me in the eye?
Or even stand the sight of me at all?
How can she stomach it?
The memory of seeing me shoot that woman...
Um, you know, the reason I... wanted to get closer to you in the first place was... to try to understand what you two felt for each other...
You and Jemma.
- And I finally do.

What we felt...
Past tense.
'Cause my future with Jemma's dead.
Killed that, too.
It's okay.
It's okay.
There isn't room in my heart for two people.
You were everything to me.
I know.
But as devoted as I was to you in the Framework...
I understand you better now.
How deeply you love.
You do understand me, don't you?
Yes, Leopold.
Now I do.
It's sad...
But beautiful.
Like a...
A pain that... feels good,
- if that makes sense.

You understand that my love will never fade.
No, I know.
Poor thing.

And there's only room in your heart...
For her.
What?
What?
What do you mean "her"?
Listen...
- What about me?

In...

- but...

But what, Leopold?
I just...

- Jemma...

Okay.

This is a new emotion for you.
No!
God.
I clawed my way through that world, worked myself to the bone to have a choice...
To have bones and blood and freedom and love!
And...

Okay, please, please...

Remember...

I chose you!
We need to extract Fitz from that room!
Hands in the air!
Don't move!
Slow down.

- Let's just keep our cool...

Or I'll have these men weld it shut for you.
I chose you!

That's not how it works.
You can't control everyone anymore!
Watch.

We're stuck in here?
What did you do?

No!
Fitz, I got you!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Grab him!
You're lucky she didn't kill you.

- will keep her power contained.

That's not her only power.
We're not robots, Glenn.
Yes, they are!

You assume each and every one of them is a damn C-3PO unless you hear otherwise from me!
And this one!
If she so much as blinks, take her down.
- Am I clear?

- Is that really necessary?

It's essential.
Unless you can explain to me in 50 words or less why I found Jeffrey Mace's body washed up on the beach with his bones quaked apart, days after I found this base in flames, flesh melting off of robot bodies,
12 S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in critical with burns or broken bones.
Three dead...

Can you explain that?
I can try.
Wait.

- Leave me here alone.

She can't be stopped.
Freeze!

All right, guys.
It's never too late to start a conversation.
No, no!
Don't shoot!

- We've got to get you out of here.

No.

And then the base under the oil rig fell into the sea.
You expect me to believe a word of that?
She's everywhere!
Aah!
What's that mean, Coulson?

Who's everywhere?
Where's that Speedy Gonzalez girl?
Who's attacking us?

Aida got out.
- We should be good here.

She'll find us.
No!
Get out of here!
No!

No!

Leave me!
You can't stop her!
May!

We have to move!

Davis had her down for the count.
They won't listen to me!

May!

You're the only other person that knows about the Inhumans we tested.
Hey!
Try it.
Let's see what happens.
Davis...
We already left him.
I'm sorry, but he's already dead.
If you drop your guns, you can come with us.
I don't suggest staying, but the Zephyr's leaving with or without you.
Fall back!
Search the base for any other threats and any bodies!
May needs to keep us on the move.
Or Aida will be on us like a flash.

Wait a minute.

No.
No.
Yo-Yo has no idea what she's in for.
For that matter, neither do we.
It's called heartbreak, kroshka.
Not even your new powers can repair it.
Only time can heal that wound.
Go on.
To be human is to suffer.
You are far from human.
I've read that book.
We both know there are things beyond this universe.
And you may, in fact, be one of them.
I am nothing but torn and twisted insides!
I can't stand it.
I don't want it.
I can make you feel something else.
That book helps build worlds.
My plan will rebuild the world that you have grown accustomed to... one where Inhumans are hunted.
And we control the rest.
It doesn't hurt that both of us are unstoppable.
But your plan is flawed.
It's too clean.
I want them to suffer.
Now... make me feel something else.
All better now?
We lost three men, sir.
- To what?

There's nothing else here.

All right.

We'll have Hazmat come in at dawn.
We'll return in a moment.
No!
