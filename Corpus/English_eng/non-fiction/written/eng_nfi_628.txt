Previously on The Strain...
You find it a bit of an insult that you're being asked to be a baby vessel?

So you want me to be the mouthpiece for your bullshit?

It seems your operation has expanded.
Yeah, I got a new partner now.

If you could find a way to put something poisonous into their blood, you could take out thousands of strigoi and they wouldn't know what hit them.
Over 2000 of our brethren were poisoned.
Tainted blood from one of our trucks.
These are all towns in Pennsylvania.
What the hell are they up to?
These terrorists will be hunted down and destroyed.
That's so good.
Thank you.
Ma'am?
Selah?
No, thank you.
You're not gonna eat?
I'm not hungry.
You know, this is the only normal hour of my day.
If you could at least pretend to...

There's nothing normal about having armed guards watching you eat.
You know what?

This is the safest room in the whole goddamn city for humans.
Do I ask anything in return?

All I want.

Mr. Desai.
Mr. Eichhorst.
Youyou know... you know my wife, Selah?
Frau Desai, of course.
- I'll give you some privacy.

Please, stay.
Don't mind me.

I insist.
I stopped by your office and was surprised you weren't there.
I trust this means everything is in order.
Yes, actually.

The delivery room is fully equipped.
Staff all been briefed.
We've taken every possible measure to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the mother.
Excellent.
And afterwards?
Well, it's... as... as we discussed.
I'm not talking about the baby, Mr. Desai,
I am talking about the mothers.
Everything is going to change the moment this first child is born.
Surely, you have a plan for dealing with their reactions.
Honestly, sir, I don't see how it's gonna be so different.
Perhaps you should have your wife explain it to you.
Or perhaps I take something important from you to help you better understand.
- That won't be necessary, sir.

Because I confess I'm more than a little disappointed in your progress.
We're delivering our first baby nine months almost to the day.
I don't know how we could have done it any faster or better.
No?

Say, seven or eight months instead of nine?
Perhaps even as early as six provided it's an acceptable size.
I think I'm going to leave...
Then, if you shorten the recovery time for the mothers, each of them would produce nearly two babies per year instead of one.
That would almost double your output, would it not?
It's highly optimistic and well outside the margins for safety.
Yes.
But, yes, it's possible.
Shall I do more of your thinking for you?
- No, sir.

Look around, Mr. Desai.
Every single person in this room serves a purpose.
That's why they are allowed to dine here.
If you can't fulfill your purpose,
I will find someone who can.
I understand.
Him?

Check his belt.

It opens every door in this facility.
That's great, but how are you gonna get it?
We can't even go to the bathroom after what happened last time with our chaperone.
I'm working on it.
Miranda, report upstairs immediately.
So, I'm gonna need your help with something, Miranda.
I told you, I'm not interested.
This isn't a request.
Um, Sophie's going in for a Csection tomorrow.
And it's going to be a very emotional time for her.
Yeah, especially when you take her baby away.
I'm not an idiot.
What are you gonna do with it?
Baby's going to be well taken care of.
But not here.

No.

Sophie's job, and the rest of the women here, is that more BPositive babies... to increase the percentage of the population.
She's gonna freak out.
That's where you come in.
See...
Sophie trusts you, so you're going to be right there by her side every step of the way, you're going to reassure her everything's fine, you're going to tell her that her baby's in the best of hands.
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna lie for you.
Miranda, look, I know that this place, it's not really your idea of paradise, but, you gotta believe me,
there are places out there that... would be a living hell for a girl like you.
So, turn me down again,
and that's exactly where you're going.
What am I gonna do?
If I say yes, then I am just as bad as he is.
But if I say no, he's gonna send me away.
You have to do it.
I can't be part of this.
It doesn't matter whether you're part of it or not;
He's gonna do it anyway.
If you turn him down, he'll just find somebody else to take your place.
And you'll get shipped out to God knows where and nobody will ever hear from you again.

I get to keep my soul.
Look, you only have to do it long enough to get your hands on a key card, right?
Just do what he says.
- Hey, how's it going?

- No strigs all morning.

- Hey there.

Thank you.
So, I'm gonna grab a couple a guys,
I'm gonna grab another truck tonight.
Eph?
They'll be guarding those supply lines closer than ever now.
Besides, they're onto something new here, something big.
It's here.

- How long is that gonna take?

Eph, we got 'em on the ropes, man.
They're turning everyone they can just to try and find us.
We can't just sit back twiddling our thumbs while you play Sherlock Holmes.
Jason.
Give the guy a break, will you?
- Have some breakfast.

Irrelevant.
Thank you.
It's hard to concentrate with "Che Guevara" up my ass.
Find anything?
There's a shipment today a few miles from here.

I'll go with you after you eat.
What if I'm not hungry either?
One omelet, coming up.
God knows when we'll run across real eggs again.
Shit!
- We gotta move!

- People, move it!

Move your butts!
Get 'em!

They want to turn us!
Don't let them sting you!
Nadia!
- Get him out of her!

No!
My Gosh!
Eph?
No!
Jason!

Do it.
It's OK, sis.
You make 'em pay.
We have to go!
We can watch from here.
- You ever fire one of these?

We used to shoot bottles on the river bank.
There's a big difference between shooting at a bottle and shooting at a person.
First of all, the bottle doesn't shoot back.
Never point at anything you're not ready to kill.
What else do I need to know?

Rules?
Look, these guys are gonna give you shit.
Keep your head down, stay ready, and remember this is just a tool.
This is your real weapon.
And when it's time to pull the trigger, you don't hesitate or you're dead.
Do you understand?
What are you doing?

- I'm hungry.

On the table, it's merchandise.

- Need some help!

Rafi!

- What happened?

- I got jumped.

- By who?

Said it was their spot now.

Let me get a towel.

You're gonna be alright?

Gus...
There's no way two guys pulled a move like that without backup.
- You're sayin' there are more?

It's not gonna be enough just to take out two of 'em.
I'm gonna find their nest, and we're gonna burn
- that damn thing to the ground.

I'll be back.
- Any idea what they look like?

They say the new guy has a black and grey beard.
Like that guy over there?
- Yeah.

Go back to Creem.

I'm gonna follow this rat back to his nest.
Hey, guys.

- Any good stuff?

Let me show you real quick.
- Get a new piece?

Yeah, we got guns.
- Here you go.

This is good.
- Put it away over there.

When is the next driver coming?
Next time we get some stuff from those locos.
Better get some quick.
Yeah, punks.
It was too easy.
What am I supposed to do, exactly?
Keep her company until it's time for her spinal, answer her questions, allay her fears.
How do I answer her questions?
Every mother going into a Csection wants to know the same thing,
"Am I going to lose the baby?

"Will it hurt?" The answer is always the same.
Which is?
"There's nothing to worry about.

And, Miranda, she won't believe it if you don't.
Where's Dr. Weiss?
She's getting ready for surgery.

Great.
Come on, I'm not totally useless.
What's going on?
That's just it.

I have been asking for the doctor and, what, she doesn't have like five minutes to talk to me?
I am having a baby for Christ's sake!
It's like they don't even care anymore.
I'm sure they care, Soph.
I'm just nervous.
I know it's a horrible thing what they are doing to us, but I can't help it.
This baby is the only family I have left in the world and I just want to make sure that everything is OK.
I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna begin your epidural in just a few minutes.
Miranda, you're gonna have to scrub in.
How... how long will the operation take?
Why?

All the bedside manner of a tarantula!
She reminds me of my grandma...

She was a coldblooded bitch, too.
It's a pretty name, though.

Don't know.

What about Olive?
Do you like that name?
For a cartoon character, sure.
It was my mother's name.
Sorry.
Now it'll be her name, too.
Another blank, Bob?

This isn't supposed to be fun.
But I need you to stay focused, alright?
I can't repeat myself.

Miranda!
What the hell are you doing out here?
Nurse Ratchet gave me a few minutes.
- How is Sophie?

Look, she's scared and emotional, and everything sucks, but she's going to be fine.
I understand that this is very difficult on you.
But you gotta believe me, this is for the greater good.
You'll see when it's all over.
I'll show you my gratitude, OK?
Take five minutes.
You read that one?
I never said four weeks.
- You did too.

Same thing.
Why don't you get your boyfriend to put something new on the TV.
"Boyfriend"?
Marta...
You're kidding, right?
You know, I'm usually a pretty good judge of character... but I was wrong about you.
I thought you were one of the smart ones, that you got it.
No.

It's not like that.
I hope it's worth the rug burns.
Go to hell.
You know what?

I'm trying to help.
Cut the bullshit, Miranda.
Only person you're helping here is yourself.
They're emptying the entire building.
I've never seen them do that before.
Usually, it's squatters or people living off the grid.
Thank you, Baby Jesus.
- Food?

Alcohol.
No, thanks.
Come on, have a drink with me.
I can't.
Eph, after the day I had,
I think you owe it to me.
I really can't.
Got it.
How long?
Nine months, four days.
Ever since, Illumination Day.
Sorry.

It's all right.

I'd love to, I... but, I don't deserve it.
Well, I do, if you don't mind.
Knock yourself out.
But I can say from experience, it's not gonna help.
Great, you're an expert on this too.
Enough to know what you're going through right now.
I doubt it.
You're feeling guilty.
Feeling angry.

Because you spent all that time fighting and you thought maybe you could make a difference, and now you're back at square one.
And you've lost your brother and your team,
and now you're wondering... what was the point
of any of it?
I told you, I've been there.
You and Jason relit a fire in me that I thought had gone out.
What is it?
There's a lot I haven't told you about what happened in New York.
The explosion, the counter strikes, the nuclear winter... all of it happened because of me.
What do you mean?
My son, he set off the nuke.
I don't understand.

He and his mother had been taken by the Master.
She had been turned, so I "Released" her.
Zack saw the whole thing.
He didn't push the button 'cause he wanted people to die.
He did it 'cause he was angry with me.
What happened to him?
I went looking for him in the aftermath, but he'd disappeared.
Do you think he's still alive?
I don't know.
Some days I hope so.
But if I'm being honest, there are other days where I think he would be better...
I can get you to the SEPTA tunnel.
If you want to part ways after that, I understand.
Jason wanted us to make 'em pay.
That's what we're gonna do.
So...
- where to?

That wasn't a raid.
We're used to blackedout buses, strigoi enforcers, people screaming, trying to escape, but this was the exact opposite.
This was the very definition of a "Calm, orderly fashion."
What is that?
"Join The Partnership in this exciting new venture.
"Building sustainable farms for a better, brighter tomorrow.
Get out of the city, get back to the land."
Recognize the name?
"New Horizons."
It's on the wall in the transportation office.
And the train schedule too.
The units, they've been shipping people out of the city.
Why?
Well, think about what they've been doing the last nine months.
They've built up all this infrastructure for The Partnership, but they haven't been maintaining it.
They stopped repurposing materials and repairing vehicles.
Now they're rounding up the workforce, shipping them out.
The question is where?
I don't know, but I can tell you one thing:
I bet it doesn't look exactly like this.
Yeah.
I followed them back to an old NYPD armory.
They've got two men guarding the front door, it's reinforced steel, and at least four more inside,
- maybe more.

Definitely.

So let's go take it.

The problem is they're excops.
I recognize 'em from the neighbourhood.
One of 'em is a beat cop named Flores;
The other's a bitchass lieutenant named Ricci.
- How many total?

Easy.

I mean, they can't kill us all, right?
You wanna bet?
Look, they're excops.
That means they're highly trained and armed to the teeth.
We gotta be smart about this.
- So what's your plan?

We go in through this tunnel.
There's a section of ductwork that leads up and through the back wall.
Hell with that.
We're not crawling in on our bellies like a bunch a goddamn cockroaches.
When they came into our place,
- they disrespected us.

We're going through the front, like men.
- That's right.

That's fine by me.
But what are you gonna do about the trip wire?
- What trip wire?

We don't have any idea what's waiting for us behind that front door.
And I don't wanna be the first one down that hallway.

- Not me.

Anybody else wanna volunteer?
Alright.

Now, this is not gonna be a cakewalk, but if we get it right, we're gonna be set for a long time.
- Yeah.

And we get the sons of bitches that killed Rafi.
Alright, listen.
This is gonna be the easiest way into the tunnel.
Is it this?
Pair of nines.
Come on, cough 'em up.
You don't even smoke.
I do now.
Alright, guys, I'm out.
Light 'em up.
We got company!
Taking fire!

Damnit!
- Go!

Shit!
You did what you had to do.
My man Gus, the man with the plan.
Do you feel any pain?
- Here you go.

Pressure is normal.
What's happening?
I'm getting ready to make the second incision.
Just keep breathing.
Making the second incision now.
There we go.
Hey, it's all right.
I'm scared.
There's nothing to be scared of.
Just try to relax.
I can't!
- BP is normal.

- Tell me about your kitchen.

What?
When you were growing up.
Everyone spends a lot of time in their kitchen.
What was yours like?
Two culture clamps, please.
It was... it was sunny.
My mom painted it yellow herself, like, three different times trying to get the right shade.
How is she doing up there?

Close your eyes.
Yes, Doctor.
Now breathe deeply.
Tell me what else you remember.
Bladder blade and Richardson retractor.
I remember the smell.
What did it smell like?
Vegetable soup.
That was her favourite.
Suction.
And she was always playing music.
What kind of music?
Bob Dylan.
Simon and Garfunkel.
We're ready, Sophie.

Got it.
- It's OK.

- Here she is!

- Clamp.

- It's good.

There we go.
Why isn't she crying?
Respirator.
Miranda, why... why isn't she crying?

- Relax.

There we go.
- Prep for closure.

She's beautiful.
I want to see.

- There you go.

What's going on?

- Why can't I see her?

- Needle driver.

- Suction.

You have to leave now.

- I want to see my baby!

Outside now!

I wanna see my baby!
Goddamn it, Miranda!
Miranda!
- What the hell?

Jesus.

- Hey, tell her to back off!

Ok, ok.
Key card!

Easy, easy.
- Easy, easy, easy!

I can help you, listen to me!
Bitch!
Did you honestly think I was gonna let you...?
Open this door now!
Wanker!

She went down there!
Please help us!
Let me go!
Let me go!
