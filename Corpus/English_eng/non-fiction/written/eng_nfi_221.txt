How's your new partner?
Uh, typical eager-beaver rookie.
Can't wait to clean up the streets and protect and serve.
Ah, it's such a cute age.
Aw...
Can I tempt you with a batch of some fresh maple crèmes?
Okay, all right.
I had to chase him four blocks, but I got him.
All right, I'm calling the station.
Dispatch, this is Officer DeLuca.
Be advised... the maple crèmes are fresh.
[Laughter]
This is what you're doing while I'm out there risking my life?
Oh, James.
Some day you're gonna learn the difference between the perps that need chasing and the ones that are just "eh."
And there's your confession.
[Laughter]
Now just relax, order yourself something.
What?
A cronut.
It's, uh, part donut, part croissant.
It's what they call a hybrid.
I-I know what a cronuts is, and no, I don't sell them.
Nor do I sell muffins or duffins or muffnuts.
[Laughter]
The name of this place is
My parents did not smuggle me out of Communist Poland in the hold of a cargo ship so that 65 years later, I could sell you a damn cronut!

Scone?
Get out of here.

Now, I know what you're thinking...

[Laughter]
So what kind of vagina can I get you?

Arthur, it is only okay when I say it.
Oh.
Donut man!
You got a "Help Wanted" sign in the window, which you don't need anymore, 'cause I'm here.
Mm, I ain't really a résumé guy.
And I used to drive a truck for the Salvation Army till they turned that into an Old Navy.

Do you believe in profit sharing?
You want benefits, why don't you apply at the Whole Foods?
They turned you down?
Bastards!

So what would I have to do?
Uh, work the counter, brew coffee, make change.
You need help with social media?
How old are you, man?
[Laughter]
I hate to break it you, but this is a donut museum.
[Laughter]
It happens to be my slow time of day.
It's 8:00 a.m. in a place that serves breakfast.
In a city full of fat people.
[Laughter]
You got, like, one customer here, man!
You have a point?
This place could be a gold mine, you know?
Just remind the world that you're here.
Maybe put a chalkboard outside with a "Donut of the Day" on it.
You know, eventually, the chalkboard's gonna get stolen, but that's fine.
"Yo, yo, you heard somebody stole the chalkboard from the donut shop?"
Now everybody talk about donuts, man!

Bam!
You realize this is a job interview, right?
Actually, not bad.
[Laughter]
Who was already in the room when I made the offer.
[Laughter]
Fawz, why are you in such a good mood?
For years, I'm buying buildings in this dung-heap neighborhood.
And now Starbucks is opening.
Rents will rise, and I will be rich!
I'm gonna have money coming into my ass!
[Laughter]
Who is this black guy?
[Laughter]
Actually, I go by Franco.
Only my friends call me "black guy."
I'm not allowed to call black people black people?
[Laughter]
So, Arthur, have you considered my offer?
Sorry, Fawz, I'm not selling the shop.
Arthur, give it up!
Fancy people are moving to Uptown, and they don't want donuts.
They want to drink kale smoothies and not vaccinate their children.
Uptown is being gentrified.
Low-income families and small businesses are being pushed out by soulless chains and condominiums for rich white people.
Uh, aren't you a rich white person?
Yes, and I have to live with that every day of my life.
[Laughter]
Just give me a couple of days to think about it.
No, you don't have to think about it, man.
'Cause you can't sell this place.
It's the heart of this neighborhood.
I remember when I was six, my dad came back home with a box of Superior Donuts.
We sat out on the porch all night, eating donuts, watching them put up Christmas lights on the crack house across the street.
[Laughter]
Damn, they worked fast!
[Laughter]
Your point?
My point is this neighborhood is our home.
They're coming to push us out.
And you got to push back, man.
You built something here, and it deserves to live on.
Who the hell is this guy?
[Laughter]
Mark my words, Arthur.
You will rue the day you said no to me!
Ooh, that sounds a little terrorist-y.
[Laughter]
Sorry about that.
Have a nice day.

You will not regret this, man.

Oh, you mean the 21st.
No, I don't.

Did we discuss you painting my shop?
It's called "ancient ivory."
Like you.
[Laughter]
Your jukebox ate my quarter.
That thing hasn't worked for years.
Oh, well, I was trying to find some Biggie Smalls, and all they had was Little Richard.
The next time you think of painting, ask first, okay?
Actually, you're doing a pretty good job.
I'm more of a street artist.
It's social commentary.
[Laughter]
Why is it like when a white dude like Banksy does it, it's great art, but when a black dude does it, it's graffiti?
[Laughter]
Are you a racist?
Not yet.
[Laughter]
Well, Basquiat started as a street artist, so I suppose you're in good company.
I'm shocked.
Just because I own a donut shop, I can't like art?
I watch documentaries.
I got Netflix.

[Clears his throat] Morning, Arthur.
Hey.
Are you being robbed?
[Laughter]
No, no, he works here.
Yeah, I work here, fat Bruce Willis.
I've seen it.
Name's Carl Tushinski.
People call me "Tush."
'Cause I got one you can bounce a quarter off of.
[Laughter]
He's my most loyal customer.
Yeah, he used to come in here every morning before his shift at the John Deere factory.
Then he kept coming in when the plant went belly-up.
Best thing that ever happened to me.
Now I work when I want
I deliver pizzas, walk dogs, do some modeling.
Mostly print.
[Laughter]
I've done a hell of a lot of "before" pictures.
You know, this place is kind of like my office.
[Laughter]
I know, but I have some ideas about boosting business.
Or we can pass out some flyers at the weed dispensary.
Are you married to donuts?
[Laughter]
I can totally amaze you with $1,000.
Why don't you mildly surprise me with $50?
[Laughter]
Mm, I get it... you ain't got that kind of money.
No, I got it... in my emergency fund.
Well, you should, because this is an emergency.
If you don't do something, Starbucks gonna put you out of business.
[Laughter]
Okay, first of all, that's redundant.
[Laughter]
I'm gonna give you, uh, $200.

This is my friend Sweatpants.
He's gonna stand outside and pass out flyers and look delicious.
[Laughter]
And I'm gonna post this video on our new Instagram account.
All right, Sweatpants, say your line.
Who wants to go nuts for donuts?
[Laughter]
All right, Sweatpants, make us proud.
And, look, don't go north on Foster Avenue.
Some of those sprinkles are gang colors.

You really think that's gonna work?
Absolutely.
I also lined up a poetry slam for tonight, and I posted a bunch of dope-ass Yelp reviews.
Dope-ass... that's good, right?
This is going to be your biggest day in years.
Yeah, well, that would be nice.
Wish you had seen this place in its heyday.
The factory was doing three shifts a day, people were having breakfast all around the clock.
The air was thick with the smell of donuts and cigarettes.
Wonder where those people are today.
Probably dead from all the donuts and cigarettes.
[Laughter]
Just saying, you can't give someone a ticket for being annoying.
I can, and I did.
Fine, but I'm not paying it.

Hey, Arthur, I just got a flyer from a giant donut named Jockstrap?

Actually, uh, his name is Sweatpants, and I'm Franco.

Dad was a stubborn S.O.B.
He cheated at bowling and never once left a tip.
[Chuckles] Best friend I ever had.
Yeah, he started bringing me here when I was a little girl.
We'd come after school, after church, after Cubs games.
