What you up to, Jeff?
I'm using this incredible new app to help me find love.
Ooh.

Oof!

Are you rejecting these women based solely on their looks?
- That is really disgusting.

It's much deeper than that.
It also shows me what kind of music and TV shows they're into, all right?
Okay, maybe you guys are right.

I could be closing the door on a beautiful relationship here.
Here, see this girl?

I'm gonna send her a heart.
Oof!

Yeah, but come on, Jeff, if you blow it that hard, you can destroy any kind of love.

Ooh, scary.

You morons.

Um, sure.

You know, I've been thinking.
Even if it was just a simulation, the time we spent together was so amazing.

I kept trying to break up with him, but I just couldn't shake him.
The big me is suffocating in that relationship, Jeff.

Nice.

Little Kiki says that if I'm gonna have a real shot at this relationship,
I need to be a strong, independent man, and that means no more roommates.
And quite frankly, she's just been getting kind of a bad vibe from you guys.
You have to kill her right now, okay?
Yeah, see?

But we're your bros.

It just doesn't seem right.
Seems like there should be a saying for that.
