Previously, on "The 100"...
Clarke:

Clarke:

We didn't treat her.
Abby:

There's only one variable that separates Luna from the others.
Nightblood.
I should be going to the island to make Nightblood.
If Jaha's right and Becca created
Nightblood there, they'll find her records, and all they have to do is reverse-engineer it from Luna, and everyone lives.
If they can get it done before the radiation gets here.
I guess we'd better finish the ship.
They told us that you have a Nightblood.
Nightblood helps metabolize radiation.
We're investigating ways to create it for everyone so we can all survive.
Echo:

That'll happen.
[Both grunting]
[Stab]
Ilian:

[Cries]
[Keys rattle]
We're bringing you home.
Your ship is shelter from Praimfaya, so I intend to take it.
[Typing]
[Beep]
Computer, show me the radiation detection software available for the drone fleet in VHDL.
Jackson:

Nightblood was designed to help the human body not reject the AI and protect it against radiation emitted from the device.
That's why it saved Luna.
That's why it'll save us all if we can figure out how she made these cells combine.
Jackson:

I know what they are, Jackson, but I'm not seeing that here.
Abby, what if we came all this way for nothing?
What if we can't figure it out?
Abby:

We know that Becca figured it out.
Luna's proof of that.
If it's not in the database, we reverse-engineer it from Luna's blood.
[Ringing]
I need a new sample.

She's sleeping, and we should let her.
We've taken too much already.
Her body needs time...
We don't have time!
Wait.

[Ringing]
Abby:

Copy that.
Abby, listen to this.
According to the record, Becca first developed what we know as Nightblood for the Eligius Mining Company.
Mining?
Long duration space missions.
Criminals were put into hypersleep and given Nightblood to protect against solar radiation.
Abby:

I don't understand.
The Nightblood protein chains are broken.
How did she get them to bind to the blood cells?
I thought you hated molecular biology.
[Raven gasping]
Raven.
[Gasping continues]
Abby:

- Ok.

Ok.

Ok.

I got it.

I have a reaper stick in my bag.
- Yeah.

Ok.

- Hold her.

Ok.
- Ohh...

[Octavia moaning]
[Wheezing]
All right.

Feels a little light.
Your hunters are slipping.
I can only dry what they bring me.
Hey, any word from Jaha?

Yeah.

_
Hi.
How light were we?
Always so serious.
Better.

The earth will be more generous next time.
See you then.
Hey, wait.

Yes, like you told me to.
Good.
Harper:

Octavia?
Harper:

Ok.

Harper:

She's soaked in blood.
Clarke:

1, 2, 3, 4...
Who are you?
How did this happen to her?
Ilian kom Trishanakru.
1, 2...
I was on my way home from Polis when I found her.
[Coughing]
Ok.

Getting her here saved her life.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, shh, it's ok.
It's ok.

Octavia, you've lost a lot of blood, but you're home now.
I'm gonna help you.
Azgeda's coming.
What's she talking about?
I...
Azgeda is coming.
- Army... marching.

War is here.
Take her.

Ok. 3, 2, 1.
Got her?
Start an I.V., blood and fluids, and... and get a suture kit ready.
Hey, I have to do this, but get Kane on the radio.
Find out exactly what's going on.
On it.
Harper, hey, look at me.
Convene the guard.
Miller's dad is ranking officer.
If Azgeda's coming, we need to plan our defense, ok?
I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Ok.

Ok.

That way, we can thin their numbers before they get a chance to close the distance.
And when they get close?
Hydrazine.
We buried what was left in the engines when we landed.
It's being dug up right now.
We're gonna pour it into the trenches.
- Hey, how is she?

Listen.

Then when the army gets close...
- We light them up.

You want to light a fire outside the ship we just spent the last month getting ready?
Clarke:

Any word from Kane?
Monty:

I have to speak to Roan.
Something happened, some sort of misunderstanding.
Harper:

Right, but there's only one way to get here from Polis.
- I'll ride out and meet him.

Monty:

Harper:

The Ice Nation thinks they have the element of surprise, but, thanks to Octavia, we do.
Pike showed us how valuable that can be.
You're citing Pike?
As awful as that sounds, yes.
[Shouting]
_
[Man shouting in Trigedasleng]
_
_
_
_
We need to talk.
Little late for that.
_
_
Ok.

David, on radio:

The radiation's our enemy, not the Ice Nation.
_
Your move, Wanheda.
10 minutes.

Echo:

What if it's a trap?
It is a trap.

David, on radio:

They're moving towards the cave.

Harper:

Monty, on radio:

Your target is the army.
Clarke is negotiating with their king.
Stop targeting.

Negotiating with these people is a waste of time.
We have the high ground.

We should just take them out.
Monty:

Riley:

I have a clear shot on the king.
This is a tinder box.

If you do this, it will be a massacre.
You need to stand down right now.
Riley.
[Exhales]
[Exhales]
He shouldn't be here, not after what they did to him.
Echo:

Archers, the first gunshot you hear, loose your arrows.
Infantry, on my command, scatter and climb.
Kill till there's no one left.
This is insane.
They knew you were coming.
We have thousands of rounds.
You'll be the ones with no one left.
Then let's hope no one shoots.
What is it?
They thought they had the element of surprise, but we did.
Someone warned them.
You think it was Octavia?
She's alive.
[Octavia exhales]
I have to warn them.
You did.
Skaikru soldiers went to meet Roan's army.
[Breathing heavily]
How did I get here?
A man brought you...

You're lucky.

Iilian.
Raven.
Abby.
Abby, oh, something happened.
Raven, you had a seizure.
We need to do a brain scan.
Jackson, she's awake.
Seizure?
Mm-hmm.
No.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- It was like my brain

was operating with such... with such intensity.
It was so real, like I was space-walking again, zero-g with no suit.
[Raven sighs]
I'm not crazy.
No.

Weightlessness.
Abby, what happened when you tried to get the Nightblood protein to bond with Luna's DNA?
The structure of the RNA fell apart.
- Why?

Raven:

Computer, show me prototype Nightblood
RNA binding in a zero-g environment.
It would work.
Computer:

You hallucination told you this?
Yes.

Communicating through your subconscious.
Exactly.
How do we simulate zero gravity in a laboratory environment?
We can't.

It's impossible on earth.
A.L.I.E. said that Becca went to space looking for a more secure environment to get away from her, but I don't think that was the reason at all.
I think she went to space to make Nightblood.
Raven, how does that help us?
It's not as though we can go back into space.
Wanna bet?
Computer, open interior blast and launch doors.
[Beep]
[Clang]
[Panting]
Who wants to go for a ride?
Harper:

Monty:

Besides, it's not like we have another option.
We have to give Clarke time.
David, on radio:

Unit One.
Unit One... check.
Unit Two.
Unit Two.

Monty:

Costa, you got eyes on Riley?
Costa, on radio:

How long ago?
I don't know.

Monty, on radio:

Negative.

Left his radio, though.
Maybe he went home.
Or he's headed to that cave to execute the king of the people that made him a slave.
Any other choices I'm missing?
Wait.

What are you doing?
Stopping a war.
David, on radio:

Maintain your position.

Roan:

Roan, we're allies.

We had a deal.

I broke it?
You nearly killed Octavia.
You're holding Bellamy and our Chancellor hostage.
You marched an army here to do what, exactly?
Why would you kill us when you know we're all gonna die soon, anyway?
We're not here to kill you, Clarke.
We're here to take your ship, a ship you restored to save your people, not mine.
That ship is a backup plan.
It'll hold 100 people tops.
Then you won't mind if we take it.
Hey... before you took him hostage, did Kane tell you about the Nightblood solution?
He tried.
Sounds to me like you're making the next Commander, also a violation of our deal.
The Flame is gone, and you know it.
If Octavia is to be believed.
Roan, this isn't a conspiracy.
I am doing everything I can to save all of us.
No, you're not.
You grieve for Lexa, yet you've learned nothing from her.
She was Trikru, but she rose above loyalty to clan.
You tell yourself you have, too... the great Wanheda, the Commander of Death who says she wants to save everyone yet builds a ship for herself, for her people.
The Nightblood solution will save everyone.
I don't believe in miracles.
It doesn't have to be like this.
Yes, it does.
The way I see it, you have two choices... tell your shooters to stand down, give us your ship, and use whatever time we have left to find your Nightblood solution, or tell them to open fire.
We have more bullets than you have men.
You'll lose.
Maybe.

Kane and Bellamy among them.
You think you can shake my resolve?
I was willing to sacrifice my own mother to stop A.L.I.E..
And I was willing to sacrifice mine to help you.
Ain't we a pair?
Fight it is.
Wait.
What if we share it?
Man:

Monty:

I need to talk to whoever's in charge.
Is Octavia alive?
Speak.
One of our people has moved out of formation.
I've reason to believe he's trying to kill your king.
Why are you telling me this?
Why do you think he's telling you this?
He's trying to stop a massacre.
- Who is it?

Riley?

That seems to be the consensus.
_
_
Kane:

If our snipers see archers on the move, they'll open fire.
- Tell her.

I will not allow my king to be assassinated.
He doesn't have to be.
I know Riley.

I can stop him.
Do you think me a fool, Bellamy?
You'd be a dead fool if you step out of this kill box without me.
Use Monty's radio and let Kane tell them we're working together to find Riley, and they'll let us pass.
[Beep]
This is Chancellor Kane.
David, on radio:

Listen to me.
Bellamy's working with one of theirs to find Riley.
You let them through, understood?
David:

_
And put it on this one.
If I'm not back before the sun goes past the trees, kill the hostages.
So much for building trust.
Abby:

She's using a huge percentage of her brain.
Raven:

Get this hair net off me so I can strap in and give her a whirl.
Not yet, Raven.
Keep doing what you're doing.
This is important.
[Sighs]
Computer, temporal view.
- Abby...

Jackson:

We don't know if it's a stroke yet.
Then what is it?
[Hatch closes]
Raven:

- We can have it here in a day.

- I need you to slow down.

You're kidding me, right?
Abby, we have a rocket.
We have to go to space and make Nightblood.
It's a... it's a two-seater, by the way.
I drive.

- What?

Heightened mental ability, hallucinations, euphoria, headaches...

A.L.I.E. warned you that the EMP would cause brain damage.
Jasper was right.
That's why no one else got an upgrade.
What are you talking about?
For everyone else, Clarke pulled the master kill switch.
It... it's like shutting down a program the right way.
When the EMP fried my chip, it was more like cutting the power from the OS while the ram was still full.
Go on.
Part of A.L.I.E.'s code is still in my head.
That's why I know things I was never taught.
Becca's mind was in that code.
That's why you knew where the rocket was.
Yes...
And now I need to learn how to fly this thing.
Wait.
Raven, your brain scan showed evidence of a stroke.
I'm afraid that if you keep pushing like this, it's just gonna make things worse.
I've been through worse, Doc.
Not worse than this.
Raven, it could kill you.
Could or... will?
So, what, I survive long enough for everyone else to die?
I can't do that, Abby.
Even if it costs me my life... you have to let me go.
Abby, wait.
Why haven't you had any symptoms?
They used the EMP on you, too.
Because we both know that brain trauma can induce entirely different symptoms in different people.
Still, Abby, we have to scan your brain, too.
I'll let you know if I have any headaches, ok?
Bellamy:

That's where we'll find him.
Are you really willing to kill your own man to save my king?
Don't you get sick of it?
Sides... my man, your king.
Praimfaya doesn't give a damn about what clan you're from.
I'm glad you'll get a chance to say good-bye to your sister before it comes...
Unless we all die here today.
If you had killed her, these chains would be around your neck.
It's like Queen Nia used to say... war makes murderers of us all.
50 spots apiece.

Can your people?

I'm a king, Clarke.
I don't have to ask my people what they want.
The real question is, how are you gonna sell this to your people?
They won't be happy about losing half their seats in the lifeboat.
We don't need to be happy.
We need to survive.
If Skaikru won't follow you when the time comes to close the door,
Azgeda will see that it gets done.
Well, let's hope it never comes to that.
_
[Slice]
Bellamy:

If he fires that gun, we'll be at war.
Whatever you say.
Bellamy:

Riley, stop.

Get out of here, Bellamy.
Echo, Echo, wait.
If you fire, he will.
Riley, Riley, listen to me.
Pulling that trigger won't end anything.
Kane and Monty will be executed, and our side will open fire.
It'll be a bloodbath.
You're a prisoner.
You're just saying what they want you to say.
I know all about that.
I'm done with this.
Move, or I'll kill you, too.
Riley, stand down, ok?

I know how you feel about them, and I know what they did to you, but your life... your life was saved for a reason, and this isn't it.
Please.
Don't, ok?

He's listening to me, aren't you, Riley?
Trust me when I tell you, if this turns into a massacre, it will never get out of your head.
War made me a murderer.
Don't let it happen to you.
[Crying]
[Panting]
We've searched half the ship.
What makes you so sure he's still here?
You didn't see him in Polis.
He was on a mission to destroy tech.
It was no coincidence he found me on my way here.
He used me to get in.
This whole ship is tech.
Where would you go to do the most damage?
The server room.
This way.
I got you.
Echo:

Clarke:

No one died today.
So what did we miss?
Nothing, Sire.
_
_
_
Ilian, no.
So I take it we're not at war?
Not today.
Whatever you do here, it won't bring your family back.
No one needs to die.

Octavia:

If it blows, you'll destroy the whole ship.
That's the idea.
And the ship?
Octavia:

I hate this place, but now we need it.
If we can't crack Nightblood, we'll share Arkadia, find a way for us to survive together.
Ilian, please don't do this.
Were you in the City of Light?
No.
Then you'll never understand.
No... no, Ilian.
[Explosion]
It came from Arkadia.
[Explosion]
[People shouting]
[Alarm blaring]
[Metal clattering]
[Flames roaring]
[Coughs]
Niylah.
[Coughs]
Niylah?
[Coughs]
[Both coughing]
What the hell are you doing?
[Niylah gasping]
Making sure you don't die.
[Coughing]
[People shouting]
Man:

Freddie!
[People coughing]
Man:

I have to find my sister.
She was in medbay.
How did this happen?
[Explosions]
- There.

O. O!
Come on.

I got you.

Let's get you out of here.

O.
[Crying]
All right.
Hey, hey, hey, are you ok?
I'm ok.
[Coughs]
- Help Octavia.

Clarke:

I got you.
[Coughing]
Hey, hey, hey, it's ok.
It was Ilian.

[Octavia wheezing]
Bellamy:

[Explosion]
[Explosions]
[Metal creaking]
Man:

[People shouting]
[Explosions]
[Metal creaking]
[People shouting]
Clarke?
Clarke.
How'd you get here?
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
Honey...
[Gasps]
You're running out of time, Mom.
