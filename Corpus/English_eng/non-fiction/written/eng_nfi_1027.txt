Maggie?
It's like three o'clock in the morning.

Yeah.

Trying to figure out the rest of my life.
You wanna talk about anything?
I got up, I got dressed, I was gonna steal your wallet and sneak out.
There's no money in my wallet.
Trust me, I know.
I was about to leave... but that would mean heading back to the same old thing I've been doing for the last 40 years.
Same people.
Same conversations.
Same ol' Maggie.
Do you have any idea how much fun I had last night?
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
Yeah, yeah, the sex was fine.
Okay.
I'm sorry, it was great.
But it was more than that.
It was the whole night.
You know, I...

I don't know... it's like the feeling you get when you're 17 years old, and it's the first day of summer vacation, and you just discovered where your sister hides her weed.
I don't wanna lose that feeling.
I get it.
Freedom like that's the best thing in the world.
Except for cocaine.
Fuck, I miss getting high.
Where are you headed next?
Well, after what I just said,
I should probably hit a meeting up somewhere around here.
Then I got a gig in Albuquerque in a few days.
I'm playing the Bernalillo Winter Harvest.
I go on right after they crown the Bernalillo Armadillo Princess.
You want a ride?
You wanna go on the road with me?
Well, I wanna go to Albuquerque with you.
After that, who knows?
Maybe I'll go to the next town, or maybe I'll just settle down in Albuquerque and open a candle shop.
Well, probably not that 'cause it sounds fucking awful.
Either way, I'm not going back.
Great.

I gotta go back.
I have a few things I have to take care of.
And I can't leave without saying goodbye to my family.
'Cause last time I did that, they just got all pissy.
They're real drama queens.
Yeah.

Unless, of course, you have a chance to buy a really pure, uncut eight-ball of cocaine.
Hey!
Mornin'.
Did you get any sleep last night?
I got about three hours.
Had a 20-minute break at the Safeway, slept for half of that.
I fell asleep at that stoplight on Mesa.
Cop woke me up.
Uh, neither one of us could believe I wasn't drunk.
Shit.

Oh, I can't.

We like to go on the elliptical and watch The Today Show.
I love when Al Roker wishes old people a happy birthday.
I don't know why.
How 'bout dinner tonight?
Uh, it'd have to be early.

Oh, and I got an open house at school till 7:30.
Longer if I get cornered by Mrs. Bayles.
"Katie isn't being challenged enough."
Having you as a mom, I bet she is.
This sucks.

I get off early on Friday.

Perfect.

Ooh.

I don't know, customer who wants to hook up with the stock boy?
Yeah!
And you'd make a cute stock boy.
All right, you guys about to do it?
And I'm gonna go to the gym.
Bye, guys.
Take care, Abby.
Hey, Ab, uh, if that hot redhead from the DQ is there, would you get behind her and sneak some video?
You know, like, of her butt?
How do you not have to register where you live?
I'm always impressed at your ability to make women run out of the room.
Thank you very much, Daddy.
Glad to see you're finally awake.
What are you talking about?

We start at 5:30.

Early is on time.
On time is late.
Yeah, you didn't know that?

Every day feels like his first day.
You know, at Safeway, every team member is valued and respected.
Hey, respect this.
- Maggie?

- What you doing here so early?

On time is on time!
I wanted to talk to you guys about something.
I figured you'd be up.
I didn't figure you'd be here.
Yeah, well, Dad came a-knocking, told me Colt was fucking everything up.
Needed to come on back and clean up his mess, so...
Ha.

That's not what you said, is it?
What's going on?
You know, you smell like a bar.
But not... not your bar.
Like a...

You know that lowball offer I got on the bar?
I'm gonna take it.
You're actually selling the bar?
Yep.

Oh, shit, I kinda thought that was one of those crazy things you say you're gonna do but you're never actually gonna do it.

Hold on.

You can't leave.

Colt, I know that, but that's like six, seven months away.
Okay, what... what if it comes early?
You mean on time?
Where you going?
I have a friend who's playing a show in Albuquerque.
Who's your friend?
His name is Clint.

I'm driving him to his next gig.
Whoa, whoa, wait a second.
This that dude from the bar the other night?
That guy?
No, no, hold on.

That guy don't even drink.
Are you fucking kidding?
You're going down the road with some guy you met in the bar?
It's not about the guy.
Yeah, right.
You could've sold that place three weeks ago.
I don't have to explain myself to you.

Great.

Gee, I just don't think he meant that.
I don't like it either.
You're just walking out on us.
Well, go on, you going, too?
No, I'm happy for you.
You know, get the fuck outta this town, follow your dreams.
Thank you, Rooster.
And if you gotta come crawling back a complete failure, don't you worry, I'll accept you just like I did Colt.
Hey, Heather!

Well, I was just getting used to you calling me shithead.
Give it time, it'll come back.
Hey, Colt.
Wow, you look great.
You got that pregnancy glow.
All that weight you're gaining is going to all the right places.
Thanks.
Real smooth, shithead.
No, it's... it's not what I meant.

It's okay.
Hey, uh, I got a doctor's appointment on Friday at 4:00.
You wanna come?
Friday at 4:00?
I, um, is... is there any way we could do it, like, right now?
Yeah, I'm sure there's, like, a drive-through or somethin'.
Look, Colt, it's not that big of a deal, it's just they said I might be able to find out the sex of the baby this time.
Yeah, no, I'll be there.
I'm gonna be there every step of the way with this kid.
And... and, uh, not only will I come,
I'll, uh, pay for it too.
Whoa.

Should cover all the doctor's bills.
And... and I'll have more once I get paid from Safeway.
Safeway?
What happened?

I, uh, I got a second job stocking shelves.
So I...

You opened up a savings account?
That is really sweet, Colt.
Somethin' I wanna do for the little guy, or girl.

Either way, as long as it's healthy, right?
Ten fingers, ten toes, and a penis.
All right, here you go.
I suppose you heard what happened last night when you was gone.
- No, what?

Don't worry.

Hank, you can't fire people here.
Agree to disagree.
- Hey, Maggie.

Wait.

- Yes.

Well, it's not the first time I've heard that today.
- What?

We should talk.
Wow.

Well, point of fact, I am.
But that's not why I'm wearing my green shirt.
I am actually en route to a Jimmy Buffett concert in Denver.
I've been a Parrot Head since before it was cool.
Okay, I'm just gonna let that one slide right by.
And if you'd like to join me, I have an extra ticket.
And an extra passport to the fifth dimension.
Acid.
Okay, what's up?
Well, um, two bits of bad news.
First, the offer's gone.
You're fired.
I'm sorry.
After you passed, the buyers moved on and decided to purchase the Yarn Barn instead.
And that's the second piece of bad news.
The Yarn Barn is closing.
Fuck the Yarn Barn.
Oh, look who's here.
Hey, Mom.

Hey, did you guys see they closed the Yarn Barn?
Oh.

Can I talk to my mom for a sec?
Oh, yeah, of course.

But check this out.
I got this at last year's concert.
Oh, shit!

Yeah, it's a parrot.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

Smarter than a lawyer.
Yeah, well, have a good night.
- Goodbye, Jerry.

What's up with you?
I'm sorry... for walking away this morning.
You can't leave.
You're my mom.

And Dad can't be the only grandparent around.
I mean, reading' Goodnight Moon?
More like readin' Government Conspiracy Theory Shot on a Soundstage.
Well, looks like I'm gonna be around, for a while anyway.
The offer for the bar fell through.
Shit.
You want me to kick his ass?
Whose?
Yeah, I don't know.

Guess, uh...
Guess, in the end, it's probably a good thing, huh?
Good thing?
Yeah.

Seriously?
So, I just tell you that all my plans for the future fell apart, and all you have to say is, "It's a good thing"?
Are you really that selfish?
I'm selfish?
You're the one that's leaving the family for some guy named Clint.
Ain't even Eastwood.
You know what, Colt?

Oh, oh, that's...

Fine.
Do you wanna have this conversation?
I've devoted my entire life to this family.
And somewhere along the line, I just became invisible.
I'm Beau's wife, or your mother, or Hank's bartender.
I just stopped being Maggie.
And I got a whole list of things that Maggie never got to do.
You know, go to Paris, learn to paint, go on The Price Is Right and kiss Bob Barker.
And that's already gone!
So if it makes me selfish to wanna go to New Mexico, not even Mexico, Colt, New Mexico, then I'm fucking selfish.
Hey, Colt.
Oh.

Hey, man.

Bud and the Bud Light cans and made it into the American flag.
Did you make that?
I wish.

Now they won't let me stack anything higher than my waist.
That's cool.
Hey, uh, remember when you used to be a pro football player?
- What do you want?

I'm just here for dog food.
Dog food's on aisle seven.
No, it's on six.
Dad, I work here.
For two days.

Dog food's on six, razors are on eight... and ten items or less seems to be more of a suggestion than a hard-and-fast rule.
Oh, man... what a fucking day.
Dude, you can't drink beer in here.
All right, my manager made that very clear.
I'm not drinking it, just sampling it.
How else am I supposed to know if I like it?
You're gonna get me in trouble.
You serious?

That was a pretty good birthday.
Hey, you wanna swing by the bar and grab drinks tomorrow night while it's still free?
I can't.

- to take Heather to the doctor.

Plus, you're gonna get plenty more chances.
That offer on the bar fell through.
What's Mom gonna do?
I don't know, stick around here for a while, I guess.
I tried to talk to her.

Fuck it.

Man, oh, man.
Things get any tougher for Mom, you know?
She can't sell her bar and now her son is stocking shelves at the Safeway.
You know, the hair straighteners are on aisle eight if you're sick of looking like a fucking poodle.
That was a good one.
Oops.
Whoa!
You scared the shit out of me!
What the hell are you doing on the couch?
I was trying to stay up until you got home.
Aw, that's sweet.
I even cooked you a lasagna, but I fell asleep and it burned.
Do you know none of the smoke alarms work in this house?
Oh, yeah, my dad claims he can detect the smoke before they can.
Well, there is a black brick of lasagna in the trash that says he can't.
Is this gonna be the rest of our lives?
Hmm.
I just started this job and we're already like two shits passing in the night.
Did you just say, "Two shits"?

You know what?

But hey, we've got Friday.
- Yeah.

Friday.
About that.
What?
I promised Heather I'd take her to the doctor on Friday.
- Seriously?

I made a sex playlist on Spotify.
I just...
She asked...
And then she said we're supposed to find out whether or not it's a boy or girl.
You know, hopefully it's a boy.
But either way, you know, boy.
Well, of course you should go.
- It's just...

No, I'm...
- disappointed.

It's fine, okay.

- I'm sorry.

We'll just go to bed.

I'm sorry.
Nah, it's fine.

Do I smell smoke?
Hey, Ma, can I talk to you?
Oh.

I just want to finish up, smoke a joint, eat a whole pan of brownies.
You know, you could save some time, you combine those last two things.
Well, that's a dangerous game.
'Cause the higher you get, the more brownies you want, and before you know it, you're buying a fucking buffalo to put in your bar.
So, what's up?
Oh, so, uh, I went over to see Colt at Safeway, you know, mostly 'cause I wanted to see him in an apron.
That was a great call, 'cause he looked fucking stupid.
And that's why you came over?
I mean, that would be enough, but, no.
He, uh...

So, I got a plan.
Look, he already had that idea.

First of all, there's always someone's ass to kick.
And second, I don't need to, because I'm gonna take over the bar.
We talked about this.

Ma, the point is you sacrificed your whole life for us, all right?
It's about time we do something for you.
Aw, you don't know how sweet that is to hear, but I...
No, no, no, no, no, no.

Now you were the best mom.
You used to let us sneak into R-rated movies.
You looked the other way when you found my Playboys.
You pretended not to notice when we were re-filling the Jack Daniels bottle full of apple juice.
What?

And you just described a horrible mother.
Don't matter.

Rooster, I can't let you give up on your dreams so I can chase mine.

Even if ranching is my dream, being given a building full of alcohol is a very close second.
Now, I'm taking over the bar.
You don't like it, I'm gonna have to kick your ass.
Like you could kick my ass.
So, can I take over the bar?
I guess you are.
Hold on.
I'm not sure I like this.
Well, how 'bout we celebrate with a free beer?
But then, life moves on.
Hmm.

Oh.
Oh, my.
Colt, are you okay?
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
I just, uh, ate a pepper.

What're you doing here?
Well, I figured we couldn't make time after work, so... maybe we can make time during work.
And I just...

That's so sweet.
Well, if you were the type of guy to blow something like that off,
I wouldn't want to be with you.
Mmm...
So, when's your break?
Oh, fuck!

- Really?

I hardly felt it.
Shut up.
A break...

- All right.

All right, I'm done.

Well... does the break room have a lock on the door?
It does.
Do you know what I'm thinking?
Pretty sure you're thinking about sex, but I'm afraid it's one of them situations where I say, "Sex,"
and then you say, "Is everything about sex to you?"
- And then I gotta act like I was kidding.

Abby, come on.

Fuck, that's hot!
- Whoo.

I'm sorry, I really thought that door was locked.
It's fine.
It was their fault, really.
I mean, who throws a surprise retirement party without telling the entire staff?
I never want to show my face in there ever again.
I doubt anyone saw your face, Ab.
Well, got the rest of the night off, what do you wanna do?
Well, school is two blocks from here.
Pretty sure the teachers' lounge is empty.
I don't think I've ever said this before, but let's go to school!
Hey.
What're you doing here?
Well, I came to return your mother's ring.
'Cause I still remember at the wedding when she said,
"This ring stays in the Bennett family whether you do or not." Charming toast.
Okay.
So, I'm leaving tomorrow.
Good luck to you.
Really?

What do you want me to say?
You're running off with some musician like a damn teenager.
I tried to get you to go with me last time, but you didn't want to leave.
This town isn't good enough for you?
There's more to the world than this town.
God.

Because I don't want you to leave.
Okay, well, when's it gonna matter what I want?
I don't know what life looks like without you.
I mean, we get separated.

But you were always close by.
You're the one I'd come talk to when times got tough.
I mean, who am I going to disagree with?
Well, you disagree with everyone.
No, I don't.
Beau, I'm not dying.
I'll be back when the baby's born.

And believe it or not,
I'm gonna wanna see your cranky old ass once in a while.
I still think you're making a mistake.
Oh, that was another thing your mother said in the toast.
Just so you know...
I'm not doing this for a man.
I did that once.
When I left Nebraska for Colorado to come live with a tall, skinny rancher... who voted for Jimmy Carter.
Even though to this day will not admit it.
If I had the chance to do it again, I'd do it the exact same way.
Except for letting your mom talk at the wedding.
I wouldn't change anything either.
Except for voting for Carter.
Do you really want this?
I do, Beau.
I'm gonna miss you, Mags.
I'm gonna miss you, too.
And I love you, Beau.
I love you, too.
Also, um, the offer fell through on the bar, so Rooster is gonna stop working here to run it.
What?
Okay, bye!
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea the janitor was gonna be there.
Why the fuck did he try to join in?
It's a lonely job.
All right, check it out.
First official pour as a bartender.
Who would've thought I'd be slinging drinks for a living?
I feel like you've been training for it your whole life.
Yeah, I was a bit of a child prodigy.
So, you're not mad?
Nah, I'm tired of fighting.
You're making your mom happy and that's a good thing.
Seems like a trap, but I'll take it.
- Hey, guys.

What's going on?
Why are you guys toasting?

Huh.

Nope.

What are you doing here?
Saying goodbye.

What?

Yeah, it did.

You know, some would say best son, some would say favorite.
But the headline will read,
"Jameson 'the Rooster' Bennett, motherfucking hero."
Yeah, so, everyone's just okay with Mom abandoning us?
I mean, I'm not excited about it like when you left.
Why are you enabling this shit?
Dude, I'm running a bar now.

Did you hear anything I said to you earlier?
No, I heard you, but I don't have to like it.
It's not up to us.
Yeah, hit him, Mom.

I know this isn't what you want.
No, it's not.

Well...

A baby, a wedding,
Rooster screwing up at the bar.
But all those things will also be reasons to come back.
Look, you don't have to like it.
I'd just feel a whole lot better leaving if I didn't think you hated me.
I don't hate you.

I just...
I'm not gonna apologize for wanting to have my mom in my life.
Okay, I'll take that.
Let's drink some fucking whiskey.
Finally something we can all agree on.
All right.
To the Bennetts, the best goddamn family in Colorado, and to their best son.
Even when we're apart, we're always together.
Hey, Mary, uh, now is not really a good...
Is everything okay?
What happened?
Oh, fuck, yeah, I'll be...

Everything okay?
Uh, Heather's in the hospital.
- What?

Thought you saw her today at the doctor.
I did.
