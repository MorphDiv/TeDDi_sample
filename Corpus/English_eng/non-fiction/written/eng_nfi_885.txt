- Hi, Christy, alcoholic.

I know I've shared about this before...
Yeah, yeah, I was a crappy mom.
Let it go.
I'm talking about being lonely.
Oh, great, carry on.
So, anyway, there's this cute guy at my school, and we'd been doing the smiley, flirty thing for a couple of weeks, and one day I just got tired of waiting for him to make a move and I gave him my number.
He seemed really excited, said he was gonna call, so, crazy me, I believed him.
I mean, he drives a Prius.
Prius equals sincere, everybody knows that.
Except Brad... that's his name... never called.
So I give him the benefit of the doubt.
Maybe a parent died, maybe he died.
I was hoping he died.
And then this morning there he was, walking across campus, so not dead.
And that's when it hit me,
I'm gonna be alone forever.
(phone vibrates)
(sighs)
I have been sober for almost four years, and, yes, my life is better for it, but nobody told me that leading a clean life meant putting my vagina up on blocks.
(phone vibrates)
Would the owner of the phone or vibrator please turn it off?
It's your phone.
What?
Oh.
Sorry.
But it is something you would do.
(sighs) I'm just saying that when it comes to love, sobriety isn't doing me any good at all.
I may as well be a...
Oh, my God, it's a text from Brad.
He lost his phone, he just found it, he's really sorry, and he wants to take me to dinner.
GROUP:

Anyway, sobriety's amazing, thanks.
Okay, babe, I'm gonna head home.
You really need to drag all that back and forth every time you spend the night?
Oh, you poor, simple man.
You think this just magically happens?
This requires equipment.
Such as?
Forgetting about clothing, underwear, shoes, lingerie for before, sweatpants for after, there's also body lotion, face lotion, exfoliant, night repair, eye cream, makeup, which is a whole subcategory.
Then you've got your curling iron, blow dryer, shampoo, conditioner...
Which by the way, is two separate things, no matter what it says on that big jug of industrial crap you use.
I have a blow dryer.
Aw, you're so cute.
You have a boy blow dryer.
It's only good for drying your balls.
- You saw me?

Why don't you just leave all that stuff here?
Because then I wouldn't have my stuff at home.
I can't afford to double up on everything.
Well, maybe all this going back and forth isn't working.
Maybe we need to... make a change.
Are we breaking up?
'Cause I should warn you,
I've been getting a lot of hits on Farmers Only.
- Have you now?

'Cause city folk just don't get it.
What I'm trying to say is  maybe you'd consider...

Oh. (chuckles)
Wow.
It'd be a hell of a lot more practical.
Practical.
Be still my beating heart.
You don't have to answer now.
I'm just putting it out there.
Okay, well... (strained): thanks for asking.
I'm gonna need some time to get quiet and... give it some thought.
Cool.
- Let me know what Marjorie says.

All right, so I'm gonna ask the question that's on everyone's mind, how bad was your date last night?
It was actually really good.
- So, did you guys... ?

Eh, well, I just tuned out.
It was weird...

Gay alert.
- So where'd he take you?

(chuckles) Did he bring his husband?
Marjorie, make her stop.
Ignore her, go on.
The food was actually great.
Brad says that the human body isn't really designed to consume meat.
If the good Lord didn't want us to eat meat, why'd he invent veal?
He knows so much about the environment and food and politics.

Big news, Adam has asked me to move in with him.
- (women gasp)

- Well, I think it's a really...

It's a big step, Bonnie.
That's what I was gonna say.
BONNIE:

We're getting along great now, but, you know, it's like cocaine...

- So you're not gonna do it?

Well, Bonnie, I think it's a personal decision
- and you need to pray on it...

I was in the middle of saying something when you walked in.
- Sorry, finish.

Brad told me that, in certain parts of the world, people are dying because they don't have clean drinking water.
And?
That's it.

So what do you think?

Okay, now add a slice of eggplant and hit that with another scoop of cashew cheese.
I just keep picturing tiny little farmers trying to milk cashews.
(laughs) You know, before I became a vegan, my favorite meal in the world was a bacon cheeseburger.
And then I realized I was tired all the time.
I'm tired all the time.
- And I couldn't focus.

- I was moody.

So you get it.
Not really.
Close your eyes.
I want you to taste something.
Okay, but just so you know,
I once had a bad experience with this exact scenario.
Trust me.
Yeah, he said that, too.
Pretty great, huh?
I really want to say yes.
Give me another bite.
Now this I like.
Oops.
Oh, sorry, uh...
For kissing her?

Brad, this is Bonnie, my mom.
Bonnie, Brad.
Captain Prius, nice to meet you.
- Brad and I are making dinner.

Actually, nothing.
Brad is showing me how to prepare a raw, vegan lasagna.
Why?
Um... why are we doing this again?
Eating raw food is how human beings have thrived for millions of years.
Thrived?

- All right, off you go.

Shall we eat?
I eat all the time.

- Hey.

Ooh, that smells great.
- Yeah, couple of bone-in rib eyes.

You have no idea what's going on back at my place.
Christy's vegan boyfriend is preparing a feast
- fit for a gerbil.

Oh, no, not one of those guys.
Did he try to sell you on it?
Oh, yeah, vegans and Mormons, always looking to turn you.
(laughs)
Hey, come here.

I've seen it before, but I'm always happy to take a peek.
Ta-da.
Oh, my God, what did you do?
I thought I could make it easier for you to spend the night.
You thought of everything.
Lot of loofahs.
How many you think I needed?
I figured it was like sandpaper, you get it for different kinds of wood.
Oh, Adam.
I did good?
You did really good.
I love you.
(laughing):

I want to move in with you.
- Really?

(laughs)
Oh, damaged women are so easy to please.
- (crying):

BONNIE:

- Stop calling him that.

You already used that one, it wasn't funny the first time.
All right, here's a new one:
Jolly Green Average Height.
Say what you want, I really like Brad.
Ooh, ooh!

Yeah, hilarious.
In the meantime, last night he introduced me to Tantric sex.
Ugh, is that the sex where you don't finish?
- Have you ever tried it?

The point of it is learning self-control.
Brad says that if you're not thinking about where you're going, you get to be present for where you are.
Sounds like where you are would be chafed and frustrated.
I wouldn't expect you to get it.
Clearly you didn't get it either.
Come on, grab a box, let's go.
Brad says the orgasm is greatly overrated.
(Bonnie laughs hysterically)
(continues laughing)
All right, enough.
Oh, sorry. (chuckles)
I think that's all of it.
Wow.
It's gonna be weird around here without you.
Yeah, but you know, if you think about it, it's actually kind of cool.
You and I came together when we needed each other, we healed, and now we're ready to move on.
(crying):

(crying):

But it's true.
So true.
(sniffs) What is that smell?
Brad hooked me up with some natural deodorant.
Well, it ain't working.
I know. (sniffles)
That's okay.

I love you, too.
And I really hope with all my heart that this works out for you.
Thanks, babe.
I guess this is good-bye.
Yup.

Okay.
I'll see you at the meeting tonight.
(blow dryer whirring)
(turns off)
Babe?
Hey.

To the bathroom.
In the hallway?
At my neighbor's.
I don't understand, why didn't you just use this one?
Because somebody was in there for 58 minutes.
Hon, you sound like Christy.
I wasn't in there that long.
Price Is Right started and ended.
The guy won a Toyota, and I almost soiled my chair.
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.
- Why didn't you say something?

Wow, okay, can we file this one under "lesson learned"?
Yeah, sure.
I don't even know my neighbor.
Now I owe a favor to a 43-year-old man who uses one-ply paper and collects troll dolls.
- Again, I'm sorry.

We just probably need to work out some kind of... schedule.
Yeah, we'll find our rhythm.
What happened to my...
Problem?
No, it's just  that's my Kennedy Space Center mug.
I didn't know it was special.
Did you get it on a field trip?
My dad gave it to me.
Well, would you like to have it?
No, no, it's fine.
I'll just use one that doesn't remind me of my late father.
Whatever.
(shudders)
Okay, how about this?
Why don't we go through all the mugs,
- and you can tell me what's what?

Oh, it's already a thing.
Okay, Westfield Dry Cleaners.
Can I drink out of this, or did they sponsor your Little League team?
Actually, an old girlfriend left that here.
Good to know.
Next up, ooh, who's the slut you took to Lake Tahoe?
- Thanks again for making dinner.

Mung bean pizza tastes much better than regular pizza... am I right?
It certainly takes longer to chew.
Trust me, your colon's gonna thank you.
Well, the old girl's trying to say something.
Okay, let's get started.
Now close your eyes.
You gonna kiss me again?
No, we're gonna meditate.
Just as good.
Take a deep, cleansing breath.
Inhale...

- Sorry.

And once again, deep, centering breath.
Peace in... fear out.
(stomach rumbling)
Wow, that one cracked a rib.
Don't judge it.

Observe it?

(gunfire, tires screeching on TV)
- Hey.

(turns TV off)
- What you doing?

You mean going through my mail?
I think you mean, "Thanks for bringing it in."
Whatever, sure, thanks.
(turns TV on)
(gunfire, tires screeching on TV)
(turns TV off)
It's just you've only been here a couple of days.
It's not likely that there's anything there for you.
What's the big deal?

You're right.

(turns TV on)
(turns TV off)
Bon?
Yeah?
Jacket.
Yeah.
- Love you.

(turns TV on)
Whoa!

Really?

Yeah, what'd you think?
I don't know, one on, one off?
You're so funny.
I'm gonna go floss.
(stomach rumbling)
Oh, shut up.
(smacking, slurping)
This was a good idea, Mom.
Right?

And also miss a crucial playoff game.
I told you to record it.
A game like that you need to watch live.
Am I right, Brad?
I wouldn't know, I don't watch sports.
Really?

Yes.
Brad's more of an outdoorsy guy.
This morning, we took a nature walk, picked up litter, and saw a fox.
Well, Brad saw it.
I was trying to spear a condom with a stick.
I hope you don't mind that we brought our own food.
I try not to be one of "those people"
who imposes their lifestyle on others.
You hear that?

Is this about the towels again?
I told you, I like 'em folded in thirds.
You didn't tell me, you lectured me.
Well, that's 'cause when I said it nicely, you laughed at me.
I thought you were kidding.
Speaking of towels,
Brad and I have been sharing one to cut down on our water footprint.
I've also turned her on to mindful flushing.
Yep.

Or you could just cop a squat at the neighbor's.
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?
These quinoa cakes came out pretty good, huh?
Quinoa, quin-wow!
Christy, you sure you don't want some ribs?
They do look good.
But I'm trying to make healthier choices.
It's not just for our own sake.
You do know that the livestock industry is destroying our planet.
No, Brad, I do not know that.
Why don't you tell them about your podcast?
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

"Giving Up with Brad Partridge."
So it's about assisted suicide?
No.

Brad teaches that happiness is not about getting stuff, it's about giving stuff up.
See, our culture has it all wrong.
We spend our entire lives accumulating things when, really, we should be giving them up.
Like a cabinet full of coffee mugs you think chronicle your life?
Or a Ziploc Baggie full of old hair extensions?
You said that was my drawer.

Why are you looking at my mail?
- Maybe we should go...

ADAM:

- I'm specific.

You're so anal, your ass is folded into thirds.
Aw, been nice knowing you.
You have no idea how happy I am to be in bed with you.
Right back at you.
Mmm... this is the closest I've come to an orgasm in weeks.
What did you see in that guy, anyway?
Come on, Mom, he stood for something.
He wanted to make the world a better place and...
Oh, who am I kidding?

Are you that desperate?
Yes, said the girl eating ribs in bed with her mother.
Hey, can I get in on that?
Adam wouldn't let me eat in bed.
- Are you guys gonna be okay?

We love each other, but three nights a week is our magic number.
My magic number with Brad is minus nine, considering how many times I went to sleep with a bag of frozen peas between my legs.
Mmm.
They're the problem, right?
Absolutely.
