It is.
I understand.
Hey, Doc.
Hey, Joe.
How's it going, Doc?
As good as ever.
All right.
You gonna need any help, Doc?
Heh, you know, thanks, but no, thanks.
I like to work alone.
Camera three.
Delivery.
- Hey, Tracey.

You didn't have to bring it yourself.
Aren't you supposed to be working?
No, II got off at ten.
I brought two.
Can I join you?
Damn.
Tracey, I'm sorry, but no one can come in here.
How much do I owe ya?
No, no, I...
I got 'em for free.
I can't come in?
That's right.
Shoot.
Top secret.
Ooh.
Now I'm so curious.

In fact, I got to go back in.
I'll stop by on my way in tomorrow, if I can.
Okay, or if I miss you,
I can come back tomorrow night and bring coffees, the same time.
Thanks, Tracey.
You can have 'em both.
Thanks, Tracey.
You're a bad girl, Tracey.
Try me.
Beverly, tell Mrs. Houseman that we will refund two nights of her stay but not the whole week.
She and her New York friends keep our spa running.
Good.
How did the skunk get in her room?
What's that?
The... the, skunk, how did it get into her room?
No, no, no, no.
It... it wasn't even...
Even close to her room.
The skunk was on the whole other side of the hotel.
- It was...

Brother Ben!
Sweet and sour, salty, crunchy...
Beverly, my brother Jerry.
Hi.

So get back to Mrs., Houseman as we discussed...
Okay.
And I'll get back to you later.
Sure thing.
Is that the new girl?
Or should I say "woman"?
A woman like that, you can't call a girl.
Beverly, yes.
Are you banging her yet?
Jerry!
Respect.
She's a beautiful soul.
And she's married.
That never stopped you before.
Sock it to me.

Jerry.
What else do you have on your mind?
Swimming in my mind at this time, literally, is my new hydroponic indicasativa hybrid, a touch of the mythic AK47 by way of the Amsterdam express.
It's baked into this banana bread and infused in this potent spreadable jam that's ideal for creative sojourns of a solitary nature.
Wheels up.
Jerry, a prophet is without honor who eats his own profits.
RD, brother Ben.
It puts me in a groove, and where it stops, nobody knows.
Thank God you are no longer in the hotel business.
Where have you been, Ben?
Yeah, my new legally sanctioned business is tripling our revenue.
Is that Mother's hat?
Hello.

Which one?
Which one?
Sheriff Truman isn't here?
Well, do you know which one?
It could make a difference.
No, ma'am.
One is sick, and the other one is fishing.
It could make a difference.
It's about insurance.
I'm not sure I will be able to help you.
I'd like to see Sheriff Truman.
I'll leave my card and call in another day.
Thank you.
I'll keep the card, but unless...
Hey.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Well, lookee here.
Otis.
Hello, Buella.
How you?
Buella,
Ray and Darya...
Have you got them back there somewhere?
I'll get 'em.
And, Buella, put something better at your front door.
It's a world of truck drivers.
Ray!
Darya!
Ray,
Darya, let's go.
Mr. C. Mr. C.
See ya, Otis.
Hey, Tracey.
He's not here.
No one is here.
Really?
Weird.
Where is he?
Does this, by any chance, mean that I can go in there with you?
I brought us two lattes again.
Well, since there's no one here to stop you,
I guess you could come in for a little while.
But I don't know how you're gonna get out if the guard comes back.
Let's not overthink this opportunity.
Whoa.
What is that thing?
A glass box.
Yeah, but what's it for?
I really don't know.
It's just a job I got to help with school.
Whose place is this?
I heard a billionaire.
Some anonymous billionaire.
Mysterious.
I'm supposed to watch the box and see if anything appears inside.
What?
Do things appear?
I haven't seen anything since I started.
But the guy I replaced, he saw something once.
What?
He wouldn't tell me.
Or couldn't tell me.
We're not supposed to say anything about this place or that glass box.
It's a lot of equipment.
Is it some sort of science experiment or something like that?
I guess you could say that.
Do you want to sit down?
Okay.
Cozy.
Here's your coffee.
Thanks, Tracey.
Do you want to make out a little?
What do you think?
Stop.
What?
Shh.
Shh.
What is it, Armstrong?
Ruth.
Ruth, are you in there?
My goodness.
Come on.

Come on, Armstrong.
Come on.
Come on, Armstrong.

Come on, little you.
Yeah.
By golly.
Yes, hello?
Yeah, you don't know me.
This is... this is Marjorie Green.
But my neighbor, there's something wrong.
Yeah, um, I haven't seen her in three days.
And then there's that terrible smell.
And Armstrong smelled it in the...
Then I smelled it...

No, Armstrong's my dog.
No...

III don't know.
Um, my goodness.
Um, yes, I know this.
You know, I know this.
It was a funny thing.
I couldn't remember my address when I called you on the phone.
Where's the smell coming from, Mrs. Green?
There it is again.
There's that smell.
Ma'am, is there a manager onsite with a key?
I don't know.
Um, Barney's usually here.
Um, do you want me to go check?
Yes, ma'am, if you don't mind.
I just remembered.
Barney's not here.
He's a funny one, that Barney.
He's in the hospital, not the regular hospital.
Hey, Darlene, we're gonna need a locksmith over at 1349 Arrowhead, possible 1054.
No, no, 1349.
Ma'am, who lives in this apartment?
That would be Ruth, Ruth Davenport.
And I just remembered something.
What's that, ma'am?
When Barney's out of town, he leaves the keys with his brother.
And who would that be?
I don't know.
Um, I've never met him.
But Hank would know him.
Who's Hank?
Barney's friend, Hank Fillmore.
Where would we find Hank?
Well...
I don't know right now.
He's our maintenance man.
But I saw him out back a little while ago.
Harvey?
Harvey, you son of a bitch!
Are you Hank?
What the hell?
Police, Mr. Fillmore.
We need your help.
Did Harvey send you?
Mr. Fillmore, we need a key for Ruth Davenport's apartment.
We're trying to find Barney's brother.
Well, who told you I was going to see Chip?
Who's Chip?
That's Barney's brother.
We need a key from Chip.
I was just on my way, but h...
How did you know?
Well, do you have a phone number for Chip?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Chip?
Chip ain't got no phone.
I'll wait for the locksmith.
Excuse me.
Do you think that maybe Ruth's out of town?
Why?
Well, it would be a shame 'cause I'm supposed to water her plants when she's out of town.
I have the key.
Let's go.
Am I... am I free to go?
Gentlemen, am... am I free to go?
Harvey, you son of a bitch.
Did you send the cops to my place of business?
My work?
Harvey...

Yeah, I got it...
I got all of it, right here, but it's mine.
Mine and Chip's.
No.

Harvey...

Don't threaten me, Harvey.
Harvey.
Harvey?
Constance?
Good for you, Dave.
You're behaving yourself for a change.
Want to help me with this?
Very carefully.
Keep it way up, off the body.
Deputy Hawk,
Margaret Lanterman's on line one.
It's the line with the light that's blinking.
Okay, Lucy, thank you.
Margaret, what can I do for you?
Hawk.
My log has a message for you.
Okay.
Something is missing, and you have to find it.
It has to do with.
Special Agent Dale Cooper.
Dale Cooper?
What is it?
The way you will find it... has something to do with your heritage.
This is the message from the log.
Okay, Margaret.
Thank you.
Good night, Hawk.
Good night, Margaret.
Dave?
Dave!
On my way.
You got to see this.
The head is definitely Ruth Davenport, the woman who lived in the apartment.
And we've got a male John Doe.
We don't know whose body that is.
Nothing's come back on those prints.
But there's another set of prints all over the apartment.
And we've got a hit, a definite local hit.
Bill Hastings?
My God.
Yeah.
He's my kid's principal.
Dave!
- What are you...

- Yeah.

It's Dave, Dave Macklay.
Dave, hey.
What's going on, buddy?
Bill,
I'm gonna have to put you under arrest.
- What?

I've got to cuff you, and I've got to take you in.
My God, Bill!
- No, it...

It's okay, honey.

Could... could you tell me what this is about?
We can talk about that at the station.
I want to come with you.
No, no, stay here.

All right?

You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
But the Morgans are coming for dinner!
Do you understand these rights I am...
I understand perfectly.
Just call George and tell him where I am!
She said something is missing and it has to do with Agent Cooper.
But Agent Cooper is missing.
And he hasn't been seen or heard from since before Wally was born, and Wally's 24 years old.
He was born on the same day as Marlon Brando.
Andy wanted to name him Marlon.
And we haven't even gotten a Christmas card from Agent Cooper.
He hasn't even seen Wally.
Andy, Lucy, it's late.
Go down to storage and get those files that we talked about.
Tomorrow morning, lay 'em all out.
I'll bring the coffee and the doughnuts.
Okay, Deputy Chief Hawk.
Dave?
Don Harrison, State Police, Rapid City.
Are you taking this case?
It's yours, Dave.
Just here to help.
Any luck with the missing body and head?
Nothing.
How long's he been in there?
About half an hour.
That's enough.
You sure you don't want to take this?
Mike said you're fishing buddies.
I've known him since high school.
He might tell you more than he'd tell me.
Go on in.
I'm sorry about the delay.
Did they get you some coffee?
I'm good with the water.
Can you... can you, can you please tell me what's going on?
We'll get to that, but I have a few questions that I have to ask you first.
Um...
Do you know a Ruth Davenport?
That name sounds familiar.
The librarian?
- Yes.

That's her.
Do you know her?
Not really.
We say hello to each other.
When did you see her last?
I don't know.
Let me think.
Maybe a couple months ago?
Have you ever been to Ruth Davenport's home?
No.

I don't...

Have you ever been to the apartment building at 1349 Arrowhead Road?
No.
I never have.
II...

Could... could you please tell me what this is about?
Did you get the warrant?
Any minute.
Judge was up the mountain.
Bill, can you account for your time over the last three or four days?
Sure, yes, I can.
I've been at school every weekday.
And evenings?
Our highschool principal.
Wednesday, I went home right after school.
Thursday, we had aa meeting in the evening.
And then...
I went home.
And then...
Friday, I went...
I went out to dinner, Phyllis and I.
But we went home right after that.
And... and I was home all day today.
What... what...
What was this Thursday meeting about?
Curriculum.
Ffaculty evaluation.
It's a bimonthly meeting.
And when did it end?
Around 9:30, I believe.
I don't know.

And... you went home directly after?
Yes.
And what time did you get there?
10:15, 10:20.
Well, how long does it take you to drive home usually?
Um...
Yeah...
Yeah, now I remember.
I gave... my assistant, Betty, a ride home.
Something wrong with her... car, something wrong...
I think I'd like to speak to George.
He's my lawyer.
Is... is... is... is he... is he...

I can check.
But, Bill, is there anything else that you would like to tell me before we get the lawyer involved?
Please tell me what's going on.
Ruth Davenport was murdered.
And your prints are all over her apartment.
What?
What?
Show Mr. Hastings to his new room.
He can meet with his lawyer there.
Right, you're gonna have to come with me now, Bill.
Right out here.
To the left here, Bill.
Right... right here, Bill.
Dave, could I speak to Phyllis?
Could you let me...

I'll see what I can do.
Mrs. Hastings, we have a warrant to search your house.
This is unbelievable.
We have guests for dinner tonight.
Is that Bill's car in the driveway, ma'am?
It's the Volvo.
We'll need the keys.
Dave?
It has to be done, Phyllis.
We're coming in.
Let's go.
My flashlight's broke.
Woof.
