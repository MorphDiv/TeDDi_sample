(The day of the Wolha-dong murder incident, 00:30am)
(September 23, Friday, 00:30am)
It's...
Jun Hyuk.

I heard you were on a business trip for a meeting.
I just came back.
I'm late, aren't I?
Ha Yeon's birthday gift.
Come on in first.
Thanks for the tea.
I should wake Jeong Woo.
Ji Soo.
Leave him.

Okay, then.
Why is Jeong Woo asleep already?
This is really early for us.
He said he had something important tomorrow morning.
- He asked me to wake him up at 6am.

- I haven't heard anything.

You could've given it to Jeong Woo.
You didn't have to stop by so late.
I wanted to hand it to you.
It's Nemo.
Why?
Here.

- What?

Ha Yeon, Uncle Jun Hyuk is here to give you a present.
What?

Jun Hyuk, come on.
Ha Yeon.

It's already 1am.
I'm sorry that it's already an hour past your birthday.
Happy birthday, Ha Yeon.
I'm finished.
Ha Yeon will be so happy.
I won't be able to do this next year.
Right.

When we leave next year, we won't see each other... for two years after that.
You should visit us in the US, Jun Hyuk.
Okay.
I have to go now.
- Check their house.

Yes, Sir.
- It was on the 17th.

- Yes, immediately.

(Evidence 14, evidence 15, evidence 16)
The first witness who reported the incident was a guard.
The suspect, Park Jeong Woo was arrested on the crime scene.
The prosecution will do everything we can... to find the suitcase that has the victim,
Park Ha Yeon's body.
The case was sent immediately to the prosecution.

We will announce that after further investigation.
Is this due to a personal grudge?
Was there any reason?
What happened?
I saw your press conference.
You must be flustered, too.
- I know it's hard, but wrap it up.

I don't think...
I can do this.
- Yesterday, I...

He is.
You can leave early next year.
(UN Judicial Branch in New York)
Jeong Woo was supposed to go.
Who knew this would happen?
I think this would make a good compensation.
I'm relying on you.
(Dispatch to UN Judicial Branch)
- Jun Hyuk.

The estimated time of death is out.
It's between 12:30am to 1:30am earlier today.

Ha Yeon.

It's already 1am.
Wait, at that time...
The guy who was at their house at that time is the assailant.
- Find him.

Get a grip, Jun Hyuk.
There is no way that Jeong Woo did this.

Everything just came over from the police.

Prosecutor, these are from the police.
Here's the list.
(List of evidence from Wolha-dong murder incident)
(Fish doll)
(Evidence)
- What about the security footage?

I'll hand it in soon to get it analyzed.
Wait.
(Fish doll)
This is Jeong Woo's case.

Let's take a short break.
Why don't you eat first?
Okay, let's eat.
- What about you?

We'll be back.
(Confiscated article)
(Date of case, September 23, 2016, Yoon Ji Soo, Park Ha Yeon)
We have the result of the security footage.
Who is it?

We checked people who entered after the last witness Yoon Tae Soo left.
But they were all tenants.
Didn't anyone else go in?
- No.

Jeong Woo, did you really do this?
What about the dash cam in his car?
I will check that.
- Bring all of them.

Okay.

(Evidence 14, evidence 15)
(Evidence 15)
(Innocent Defendant)
(Present)
(Episode 5)
Jun Hyuk.
Did you find someone?
- Jeong Woo.

- Did you?

- What do you mean?

Was the doorbell broken?
There was no one else... who came by on the security footage.
Then... am I wrong about the bell?
Did I... hear that wrong?
I'm sorry... that I couldn't be of help.
Jeong Woo, how did your meeting go?
My attorney is here.

- What are you talking about?

You committed a hit-and-run and attacked a police officer.
That wasn't a hit-and-run.

In this case, you should plead mercy with the prosecutor... and reduce your sentence.
- You said I can get out.

You shouldn't have done this to begin with.
- I really have to get out of here.

I can meet the prosecutor and ask for a year and a half.
- Or find another attorney.

I really have to get out!
I was going to take your case because I felt bad.
You can find another attorney.
- None will take it with that price.

Darn you!
Darn you!
Was the bell broken?
It couldn't be.
Seong Kyu, what happened?

I can see that it didn't go well.

Don't worry.
Even if you become a convicted prisoner, it's the same as now.
You can stay here.
Isn't it nice?
He says he has to leave the prison.
Everyone wants to leave the prison.
Who wouldn't want that?
- Don't you think?

Seong Kyu.
- I heard your sister is sick.

I really have to get out.
I shouldn't be here.
Can I take a look at your case records?
I want to return your favor.
(Investigation Report)
- What is going on?

Do you have a problem moving the bowels?
I'll be right back.
Don't start anything until I finish my business.
This is not a solitary room.

It's that his stomach is rotten.
- No, it's his bowels.

- Bowels.

- Bowels.

- Bowels.

- Bowels.

- Bowels.

Tell me about it.
Okay.

I was told my sister was sick, so I was rushing to her.
On the way to the hospital, I had a traffic accident.
(Recruitment of Public Defender)
- How many applicants?

(Form of Appointment)
I can be reappointed now, right?
I will take off the recruitment notice on the bulletin board.
Public Defender Seo,
- do you trust me?

You said I shouldn't trust my clients.
All I want to know is the truth.
I want to know what you've been through... as your counselor.
Thank you,
Public Defender Seo.
(Court of Law)
Seong Kyu, it's your fault.
You are the one who made trouble.
You should have stayed there.

He says he didn't run away.
The victim wasn't hurt, so he gave his phone number.

That's what people call a hit-and-run.
Are you a judge or what?
He even fought with a policeman.

It is clearly your fault.
It is your fault.

I know I did a bad thing.
But I don't think I deserve to be in jail.
Did you talk to the prosecutor?
- Yes.

I was scared.

Right.
- What?

He's not a scary man.

Really?
He got scolded by me a lot because he frequently made mistakes.
Maybe I should check if he made any mistakes again this time.
What if he did?

That's what I wish for.
Thank you very much.

I will make sure to repay you once I leave here.
- The sky is clear.

Hold it tight.
I'm full of energy.
Gosh.
- What else was written?

Did you figure anything out about the doorbell?
You are being impatient.
I don't have enough time.
Do you remember?

Okay?
Now that I'm here, I'm dying for a cigarette.
How would I get it in here?
Gosh.
I heard there was a prisoner who got caught smoking a while ago.
What does that mean?
There's a way you can get it.
- Are you kidding me?

I wish the whole thing was a joke.
But unfortunately, I find out it's not every morning.
Just get me a pack of cigarettes.

I'm not asking for too much.
I will be waiting.
- Kick it!

My ball.
Gosh.

Jeong Woo, pass me the ball.
Do you want to join us?
They are watching you.
Let's go.
- Okay.

I'm not sure he can do this.

We are betting a cream bun on this game.

I'm cold.

- There you go.

- Gosh.

Hey.
- Well...

I'm looking for something.
Looking for something?
What's that?
Tell me.
You can get... anything you want in here except for women.
I need some cigarettes.
Hurry.
Boss.
- What was that?

- What was that?

Inmate 3866, I didn't know you smoked.
You've never talked about it before.
Well, it's been a while.

I need it no matter what.
- Do you have money?

It's 30 dollars... per cigarette.
The price has risen as another prisoner got caught smoking.
It involves a lot of risks.
It's 500 dollars per pack.
Isn't it expensive?
By the way, I don't think money is the problem for you.
What do you mean?
The seller is called Raccoon.
Do you know who he is?
Why don't you quit smoking?
Smoking is hazardous to your health.
Okay?
- Please.

- Oh no!

- I can't believe this.

Why did you do that?
- Excuse me.

Check the money kept in custody for food.
- Yes!

Thank you.
Who lost the bet earlier?
- It's Seong Kyu.

- Okay.

Let me see.

He's rich.
- Do you want to die?

This is for Miryang.
And...

Inmate 3866.
Who is she?
Is she your mistress or what?
- Come here.

She's my mother-in-law.
She came to see you several times.
But you refused to see her.
Did I?
Please come on in.
Tae Soo.
How is Jeong Woo doing?
Don't say his name.
Tae Soo.
Let's just forgive him.
Think about what he did to Ji Soo and Ha Yeon.
I want to kill him dozens of times every day.
How can I forgive him?
You know what kind of person he was.
No one treated Ji Soo, Ha Yeon, and me as well as he did.
Stop it.
I will find Ha Yeon soon enough.
That jerk...
- told me he remembers now.

Don't go, Tae Soo.
Mom, you want to believe she's still alive somewhere.
You'd rather... not have her found.
Tae Soo.

Mother, this is so delicious.
So Ji Soo's been eating this for all her life.
This is truly unfair.
(500 dollars deposited by Oh Jeong Hee)
It's 30 dollars for one cigarette.
It's 500 dollars for one pack.
(Supporters' Night)
"Moving closer, the fox said,"
"I can be your friend."
"Then, the fox said,"
"The hardest thing in life is..."
"to win someone's heart."
Father!

Do you honestly believe it makes sense at all?
It is what it is.
So you should respect her as your sister-in-law.
Father!
Right now, her family's company isn't doing well, but her family will be needed for Chamyung Group.
No, I can't let that happen.
Cha Min Ho!
I have put up with your treatment towards me until now.
I don't care if you give everything to Seon Ho.

But you can't take Yeon Hee away from me.

Yeon Hee is the woman I love.

I can't?
Fine.

Then, I will give you my approval.
- Father.

Then, I will give...
Chamyung Group,
- Yeon Hee, and everything to you.

Father.

I'm sorry, Father.
Where did your arrogance go?
Father.

- Father, I'm sorry.

- You, jerk.

I'm sorry.

Please spare me.

You're pathetic.
Yeon Hee.
Dad.
Hey, Eun Soo.
Shouldn't you finish the book with Mom, Eun Soo?
Okay.
You're back.

- Where were we, Eun Soo?

Father.
Hey, you jerk.
- I want some cigarettes.

Stop with your nonsense and get lost.
- I need cigarettes.

Don't you remember what you did?
I heard you can get them.
Perhaps, I wasn't informed correctly.
The one who got caught in 24th ward said he got them from you.
I will check with the officer again.
And you can afford them?
I guess even a murderer who killed... his wife and daughter, wants cigarettes.
You know the price.

It's 500 dollars for a pack.
However, just for you, the price is double.
If you don't like the price, go outside and smoke, Mr. Prosecutor.
I will get going.
I will give you... something better than money.
What?
You can do it, Prosecutor Park Jeong Woo.
- Cheers.

We're only drinking beer to celebrate?
Who bought this then?
Goodess.
I told you to join a law firm and find a guy and get married.
Aunt, should we sign up for a matchmaking company?
I don't have money for that.
I think the owner of the sandwich shop that just opened... is single.
That's why you've been only eating sandwiches these days.
- So is he handsome?

(Park Jeong Woo's family tree)
(Oh Jeong Hee)
(Yoon Ji Soo)
Hey!
I got so excited.
Are you out of your mind?

I came because I wanted to see you.
Prosecutor's office is nice.
This used to be Prosecutor Park Jeong Woo's office, right?
Why would you bring it up?

It's because I decided to take his case.
Why did you come to see me?
I'm aware you worked with Prosecutor Park Jeong Woo for a long time.
It's all in the past.
I've tried to meet with some of his acquaintances, but they avoided me.
I guess it's a serious case.
I don't have anything to say to you, either.
I already forgot about him.
Prosecutor Park Jeong Woo lost his memory again.
I know.

I should get going.
I looked into the record of visitations.
Detective, you said you forgot about him.
Yet, you came to visit him recently.
You don't trust me, right?
I went up against him during his time as a prosecutor, but I always lost.
This time, I want to win.
Next week is the trial.
Please let me know if you remember anything.
(Seo Eun Hye, Public Defender)
(Supporters' night for Lee Chan Young, a fencing world champion)
Congratulations.
Go easy on me.
- I am not joking.

Brother.
I am Cha Seon Ho now.
To celebrate the supporters' night,
President Cha and fencer Lee Chan Young... will conduct a testimonial game.
Please give them a big hand.
How's President Cha doing today?
It's been a while, so he seems nervous.
They used to fight... very often on that stage.
But after that day,
Min Ho couldn't hold the sword ever again.
I wonder... if he will do well today.
- Detective.

- I'll make sure I get him.

Not this one.
Then who?
Cha Min Ho.
You can keep this to yourself now.

Have you been following him?
- Yes.

Get ready.
Have you heard of fear of needles?
It's a condition where you are afraid of pointy ends.
How can he be fencing?
That jerk.
Let's endure it little longer.
Just a little longer.
Hello?
Really?
Okay.

What's going on?
- President Cha.

What happened?
- Are you okay, President Cha?

Are you okay?
- He got hit on his face.

President Cha.
Father.
Father.
Father.
Yeon Hee.
Where's Father?
He just saw his trusted son Seon Ho collapse.
He must be shocked.
I'll leave now that you're up.
- It's Eun Soo's birthday.

Don't be mistaken.
There are people watching, that's why.
We told the reporters that you overworked yourself.
Yeon Hee.
Can you stay... a little longer?
Six years ago, if we had left together, how would it have been?
I thought about it numerous times.
If we had, nothing would've happened.
You're right.
Then Seon Ho... wouldn't be dead.
I'll tell Eun Soo what happened.
Father.
Hello.
President, the chairman isn't here.
I'll wait inside.
I'm sorry.
Chairman said you shouldn't visit him for a while.
- What did you say?

Where will you go?
I have some things to take care of.
(Cha Min Ho)
I miss you.
My son.
Seon Ho.
Did Seon Ho wake up?
We just received a call, Chairman.
How pathetic.
President Cha.
- Are you okay?

Mom, this is President Cha.
- He's the one who supports me.

I'm sorry I couldn't thank you earlier.
I should've visited you.
No, it's okay.
- What brings you here?

I couldn't say goodbye to you.
Chan Young.

- Take a seat, President Cha.

I just wanted to talk to him.
Didn't you... understand what I said?
President Cha.
I told you.

Why didn't you listen to me?
I told you to go easy on me.
I doubt that you can do fencing anymore.
I'll keep supporting you.
You shouldn't make your mom work hard.
Open up a store and make her life easier.
Where will you go?
Let's go buy dear Eun Soo his birthday present.
What are you up to, Eun Soo?
Dad, did you buy my toys?
Of course, I did.
I'll be there soon.

Okay.
(Cha Min Ho)
Please sign here.
(Cha Min Ho)
That finishes things.
I have somewhere to go.

Yes, Sir.
(National Forensic Service)
Hello, Director.

I'm in Jeju Island.

There's a document I need urgently.

I'm in front of NFS.

I'd like to help you right away, but... we're undergoing investigation until today.

Could I possibly help you tomorrow?
All right.

NFS...
I wonder why he came here.
Hello.

Yes.

Cha Min Ho.

The name's Cha Seon Ho.

All right.

He was here twice last year on September 17 and 18.
Could I possibly know who he met with?
- Good job.

Now...
- This is for you.

Look.

I found out who sent you the pictures and medical diagnosis.
He's a detective from the Public Prosecutor's Office.
He worked for Prosecutor Park until four months ago.
So it was you.
(NFS Medical Examiner Dies in a Car Accident)
(Seo Eun Hye)
Why are you smiling?

You're our big boss.
It's 10 dollars per hit, right?
It isn't all that bad being in prison.

Does it hurt?

No, go ahead.
That's a good boy.
- Where am I at?

Then this will be the last hit.
You're unbelievable.
Here you go.
This is a gift.
Let's go.
I guess he was pretty desperate for those cigarettes.
It's a nice day.
Well, well.
Goodness.
Aren't you talented?
- Tell me.

I think this one would be good.
Let's see now.
- Are you sure?

I wouldn't know if it's referring to gold or not.
"16K".
What could that mean?
I'll see you around.
When 3866 was a prosecutor, he charged him with soliciting murder.
Is that right?

- What shall I do, Sir?

Yes, Sir.
16K.
- Let's start the game.

Good luck.
Go ahead.

All right.

Shoot.
- It went in!

Get him.
What?

What are you doing?

What?

- Why are you doing this to me?

What are you doing?

- Stay still.

What is this?
I just happened to notice it on the ground, so I picked it up.
I wanted to at least smell the scent of cigarettes.
I'm guessing an officer threw it away.

Go get Inmate 3866!
There's nothing on him.
I see Prosecutor Park has adapted well.
Take them away.
Take it easy, will you?
Get it done by the end of the week.
You were quite quick-witted to play such a prank.
You should thank me.
If there were real cigarettes, they wouldn't have let us get away with it.
Where are the real cigarettes?
Being in here, I learned I shouldn't give things away too easily.
I'll give you the real ones this time.
But you have to tell me one more thing.
I think I'd rather just quit smoking.
Thanks a lot, Prosecutor Park.
When will we be finished here?
Let's stop here for today.
My back aches.
Gosh, it really hurts.
Gosh.
How would I break free of this prison?
I don't see Tae Soo today.
He is off today.
Again?

If you're lying again,
I don't know what I'll do to you.
- Let's go.

(Reference Room)
These are the files.
The detective from the prosecution checked the files earlier today.
(Corpse Takeover Confirmation)
(Corpse Takeover Confirmation)
(Cha Min Ho)
Prosecutor Park was right.
I went up against him during his time as a prosecutor, but I always lost.
This time, I want to win.
(Public Defender Seo Eun Hye)
I'm Public Defender Seo Eun Hye... who will take Park Jeong Woo's case.
Excuse me.
This is Public Defender Seo.
Public Defender Seo.

Detective.
- I need to talk to you now.

Okay.
Where can we...
Detective.
Detective?
Detective, are you all right?
Detective, are you okay?
Detective?
Detective?
Detective?
Prosecutor, don't you remember?
I don't remember anything.
Prosecutor.
Do you remember who you were chasing before the incident?
Was I chasing someone?
(Cha Min Ho)
"Cha Min Ho"?
Don't you remember?
You told me you'd catch him soon.
I don't remember who he is.
You told me you'd catch him the day before the incident.
Cha Min Ho?
I thought you were joking or something.
And now that you are here,
I think there's a possibility he may have set things up.
Cha Min Ho?
I thought I could vividly remember what happened before the incident.
I thought I lost my memory about what happened after that.
There's something more I can't recall.
You have to recall what you found out at that time.
Then, we can catch him... and clear your name.
I will try my best to recall... what I found out.
Prosecutor.
(Park Bong Goo, Doorbell, 16K)
What is 16K?
I remember... where I buried Ha Yeon now.
He lied.
He lied again.
It was a lie.
He lied again.
He lied.
He lied.

Ha Yeon.
(Park Jeong Woo)
No!
- I said no.

- No.

- No, I don't want it.

- No, stop it.

- Goodness.

You weigh...
- 16kg. - 16kg.
I heard that!
16K.
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon!
16K.
That's Ha Yeon's weight.
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon.
It's Ha Yeon.
(Innocent Defendant)
How could you handle it like that?
Why is everyone trying to make me a bad guy?
- You are here.

Go find Chief Prosecutor Choi Dae Hong.
He will help me.
I will take full responsibility for that.
Hey, Choi Dae Hong.

He's the man who recommended you to the position in UN.
I don't have to worry about the appeal, right?
If you want to forget about it, it's only right that you do.
Tell this to Jeong Woo.

This is a trial you cannot win.
- Is there anything new?

Let's see what the defendant said before he lost his memory.
