- [Muzak plays softly over speakers] - [door bell jingling]
- [cocks pistol]

- [woman screams]

- [people clamoring] - [grunts] Come on!
[clattering]
- [young man] Get your asses down!

Get your ass on the ground.

- [gunshots]

fuck!

why'd you make me do that?
- Get your asses down!

- Shit!

Stay down.

[gasping] [young man] Keep your asses down!
- Bullshit!

- They don't give me...

Come on!
[clerk sobbing] There's only 50 here.

Don't hurt me!
whoa.
I shoot her in the face.
no.
This isn't ending the way you thought it would.
Stay the fuck back.
yeah.
man.

- Stay back.

all of it!

back!
Just because you made a mistake doesn't mean you can't turn this around.
look at him.
he's gonna make it.
you've got a second chance...

- I'm not fucking playing.

And I know you got this rage inside of you that you gotta... put somewhere.
Just put it right here instead.
you know that?
hey.

Calm down.

[groans softly] [sirens wailing in the distance] [breathing shakily]
[birds twittering]
[woman] Mason!
Ash is here to help with the boat.
[Mason] I'll be in in a second.
[Wendy] How do you know that's Bobby Dean?
Because I've sat with him.

what distinguishing feature are you seeing here?
his eyes?
Look like they've been sucked out by fish.
How about his fucking blue knockoff Gucci shirt?
Somebody left him here on purpose.
[boat revving in distance] we're not doing that.

- There is a body at our dock.

It's the body of the man whose business I just took over.

[Wendy] Okay.
Why don't we just go inside?
and we... we push him.
- Wendy!

[Marty] Yeah!
Nice work.
attracting a bunch of attention.
[siren wailing] [indistinct chatter]
- [officer 1] Got that?

you can't possibly think I'm dumb enough to kill someone and put the body at the end of my dock.
I've seen dumber.
My dealings with Bobby Dean were amicable.
I offered him an above-market price for a failing business.
this place has a history of chewing up men who come in here thinking they're smarter than us.
Far more formidable men than you.
I expect to see that bill of sale on my desk first thing tomorrow.
[Marty] Everything all right?
Thought I'd introduce myself.
Jacob Snell.
there.

I've come to understand that you're the new owner of Lickety Splitz.
yeah.

Thank you.
but... we had a business arrangement.
Benefited us both greatly.
The folk who thrive around here make a point of easing their neighbor's burden.
Is that right?
I figured you'd wanna continue with this local tradition.
I don't think that my employer would allow it.
You haven't heard my terms yet.
Business is business.
Yeah.
Good talking to you.
sir.
[engine starts]
- [music plays softly on jukebox] - [man] Thanks.
I got it.
- [chuckles] Thanks.

Let me help.
Vineyard Vines.
You're really not supposed to be back here.
Okay.

chivalry's dead.

- Hey.

okay.
[young man clears throat]
You from Chicago?
yeah.
- Highland Park.

the Naper-thrill.

I'm Zach.
Charlotte.
Okay.
that goes in there...
So you live here?

only for the summer.
Hmm.
So is there any chance I can get you to the party cove?
- [chuckles]

but I'll be chained to that dock.
- I see.

How much do I owe you?
so...
I have no idea.
Well... keep the change.
Hope to see you around.
we're good to go.
here we come!

- [hip-hop music playing] - [indistinct chatter]
I'm over here!
there you are.

They think you killed him.
- They think I killed Bobby Dean.

Great.

Yep.

the guy from the liquor store.
- No.

the waitress with the teeth.
Okay.

except Mary said that... just bobbing all like... what'd you tell them?
I told them Bobby Dean didn't have a nice body anyway.

I didn't kill anyone.
then I'm fucking Snow White.
- And I don't see any dwarfs around.

Can you do that?

- Me?

Just through the holiday weekend.

it'll be fucking slammed here.
I promise.
just give me a call.

You'll be fine.
[sighs quietly] [sighs]
Who... who the hell said you could come in here without my permission?
Did your pinko parents not teach you the meaning of private property?
Huh?
- Is the lake a dangerous place?

Is the lake dangerous?
This about the body they found?
dangerous is not the first word that comes to mind. [Grunts]
I've seen my share of bare bodies bloated beyond recognition... tourists turned to Swiss cheese by propeller blades...
They usually ascribe it to ignorance.
But...

Is that why you have all these guns?
[chuckling softly] If that's what you wanna say.
[sighs]
My parents don't really like guns.
bird squawking]
Why the hell did they move here if they don't like guns?
a kid can't pass middle school health class until he had his hunter's safety badge.
It was for work.
What kinda work?
My dad brings businesses back to life.
wasn't the swamp thing on the dock in business with your dad?
looks like a mighty dangerous place to be.
No.
[rifle clanking]
I don't know.
I've been here nearly 30-odd years.
every son of a bitch I've seen move here was running from something unsavory.
What were you running from?
right?
What did you do?
[rifle clicks] hold it still.

You gotta keep aiming at the target even after the smoke clears.
[wheezing laugh]
Yes!
Now that's what I love about watermelon.
- They...

[chuckles] but... [chuckles]
[Tuck] Did you know a sacrifice fly but lowers OBP?
but didn't happen at the same time.
Tuck.

[Tuck] I don't know.

Pacquiao.

for my freak show of a mother.
but a dead animal's just disgusting.
apology accepted.
I'm...

Should've known I wouldn't come at you with my right.

[chuckles] but symmetry is more attractive.
[chuckles]
See ya.
[Marty] You know that Bobby Dean had enemies?
[Rachel scoffs] Most assholes do.
People that would pin a murder on someone?
You mean the someone that stole his strip club?
please.

I am starting to get the feeling that there is more to you at least more than good hair.
And I'm not sure how I feel about it.
Rachel.

okay?
I avoided him like the clap when he was alive and I don't see why that should change now that he is dead.
But here's what I do know.
being visible to customers...
I'm not sure that's good for business right now.
You should stay away.
yeah?
camp out in the office or something till this gets sorted out.
let me ask you a question.
what do you know about the name...
Snell?
Well... they've lived here as long as anyone can remember.
Moved up into those hills when the dam was built.
Lake swallowed up their ancestors' graves.
Folks tell all kinds of tales about the devious things but who knows what is just urban legend.
[Darlene] How'd Bobby look when they fished him out?
[Jacob] Like a peeled pumpkin.
Ash.
Never trust a redneck when you need the job done right.
ma'am.

[Jacob] Martin Byrde.
Said his employer wouldn't allow it.
His exact words.
Even after he saw the body?
I watched Sheriff Nix fish it out right in front of him.
All of which means he's more afraid of his boss than he is of us.
does he have reason to be?
- [dogs barking]

don't you?
About Mr. Byrde.
ma'am.
ma'am.
[sighs] Another nest?
Mm-hmm.
Every one we've found so far has been up in the hills.
Way above the waterline.
- [thunder rumbling in distance]

It'll start before sunset.
Guess we won't have to water the crop.
[thunder rumbling]
This is Josh Silverberg.

Josh has some questions about his father's suicide.
Josh.
Leave you two to talk.
- [door closes]

actually.
You were all over my father's Facebook page.
What kind of questions?
Why'd you hang up on me when I called you from my father's phone?
- Seems like a pretty good place to start.

I guess I was surprised.
I've been calling the detective... telling him that there's no way my father could've killed himself. that I'm in denial.
to search for answers.
When I was 16... we just...
- we couldn't accept that she...

- Okay.

He told me so... ten days before he supposedly threw himself out of an 80th-story window?
I had just told him... that it was over.
That I was leaving Chicago with my family to give my marriage a second chance.
I...

How... how come I never even heard of you?
I don't know.
I have a family.
Maybe he was trying to protect me.
So you expect me to believe that my father... loved you so much that he...
- took his own life when you left?

Did you love him?
[thunder rumbling]
[Rachel clears throat]
Rach.
[Marty] Hi.
I forgot it was Sunday.
he's...

His ego just needed a little boost.
right?
Old-timers like my grandma... she used to call these big summer holidays the "ruling days.
these are the days that will rule how we live the rest of the year.

I'm guessing Marty Byrde already knew that.
I'm guessing he's not really here 'cause of the rain.
complicated at the house right now.
Well... it's me.
[Marty] Hmm.
my wife's talking to her dead lover's son.
[chuckles softly]
Thanks.

- Fuck of the week?

company's better out here.
Thanks.
[hip-hop music playing] [overlapping chatter]
no lap dance for you.
Yeah... free money.
That was good.

Who the hell is that on the pole?
We needed to class the joint up if we ever wanna make any money.
- And this was Marty's idea?

I looked at our inventory and I felt that it was lacking.
Don't get your thong in a bunch.
Competition's good for you.

we all know why you're here.
What was that you said?
It's okay.

and now you're in charge?
Don't deny it.

- [grunting] - [groans]
Anyone else got shit to say about my daddy?
Hmm?
Then get back to work.
We got a shit-ton of money to make this weekend.
- [music continues] - [indistinct chatter]
[thunder rumbling]
what does he know?
Nothing.
then?
Why'd he drive all the way down from Chicago?
Because he suspects.
what does he suspect?
Wendy.
He doesn't believe his father committed suicide.
And he's talking to the police.
did you change his mind?

- Then you didn't change his mind.

don't you think?

And what was I supposed to do?
Kill him and throw him off the dock?
What did you tell him?

I told him his father was heartbroken because I left.
- What'd he say?

Where you going?

He asked me if I loved his dad.
yeah?
What did you say?
That I didn't.
- Was that the truth?

Okay.
[panting]
[Russ] Been looking for you.
Checked out a couple of spots I know.
Water's running real good.
I thought you weren't interested in fishing with me anymore.
you planning on paying me for my time?
Of course.
Money's money.
All right.

[engine starts]
Here's that bill of sale you asked for.
You can see the final sale price there and the date of transfer.
the... title transaction.
It's all there.
- [Nix] Hmm.

I...

Seems your business partner and his girlfriend disappeared just before you moved to my little jurisdictional paradise here.
[Marty] Mm-hmm.
You have anything to tell me about that?
Got nothing to say that we haven't already told the authorities.
most neighborly advice I can give.
Whatever it is you're up to... stop.
okay?
All right.

Keep the bill of sale.
Bobby Dean had enough heroin in him to kill a horse.
We're calling it an overdose.
Okay.
Was it an overdose?
[stammers] Yesterday you seemed certain it was foul play.
we prefer to keep all options open at the start of an investigation.
Enough heroin to kill a horse.
Not even the worst addicts have that much heroin...
It was an expression.
Was it?
Let me...

It's better for all of us if we can just call this an overdose.
Understood.
You have a good day.
[clears throat]
[Petty] Holy Loretta!

You know exactly where you were taking me.
I've been...

- That's my little spot.

- [laughing] Well...

Oh!

[Petty laughs]
Oh!
[both laughing] buddy.
[grunts] Give me some of that.
Mmm.

That is the best damn day in the water I've ever had in my life.
- I know.

- [grunts] - [panting] shit.
Hey. [Clears throat]
The fuck is wrong with you?
I'm sorry.

you fucking fag!

- [coughs]

- All right.

The fuck out of my truck!
- All right.

He knows.
He knows the Snells killed him.
Fucking sheriff and even he's afraid of them.
they would've done it already.
I think.
right?
Probably why every single business rejected me the second we got in here.
Now I got that dead body.

We're screwed.

How are we gonna find enough businesses to clean that much without getting into a war with these people?
[Wendy] Uh... [sighs]
We have to build something of our own.
Wendy.
it's not gonna make a dent.
- Then it has to be bigger.

I don't know.
But you can move money through construction costs.
obviously.
Think lots of people.

And no IRS.
Okay.

- I don't know.

- Hello.

- Hi.

- Marty.

- Hey.

- Thanks for having us.

[Grace] We can go out to the porch here.
Don't swim past that red buoy.
they'll sweep you up in their wake.
Take a month to fish out all your tender little bits and pieces.
Not that I'd miss you... I promise I'll piss on your grave every last day until I die. what makes you think they'd find enough to bury me before you drop dead?
what drew you here?
the work.
mostly.

Sure.

- Mm.

- Of course.

belief.
[Mason] Hmm.
some of the other members.

I saw you...

I remember.

And all the gentlemen's clubs.
Yeah. [Chuckles] obviously we're not the most religious people she speaks for herself.
the last time we were both at a service was for my... was for my cousin Skip's wedding in a small chapel in Las Vegas...
That's right.
That lasted longer than the actual marriage.
whatever you might think of our businesses... you seem like someone who...
You really want to do some good in the world.
And we can help you.
By building a church.
Oh.
I have a...

You... you have a boat.
a sidewalk in St. Louis.

But it can be... if you build it right.
North Carolina.
he was this 70-year-old chain smoker.
He had this voice like a...

But he... he managed to gather everybody together and they built that church.
he would take me by the hand... and he would show me the nails that he hammered in.
[stammers] It meant that much to him.
it... [chuckles] it meant that much to me.
What made you stop attending?
I... [stammers] I don't know.
I don't believe that...

And then they come up with an explanation later what...
This is my calling"?
[sighs] Something happened to me.

I've never really considered myself to be a brave person.
I don't know why I did it.
It made no sense.
But something came over me... afterwards.
I had the need to help people.
Hmm. [Chuckles softly]
I think that's what everybody wants.
I think that's what everyone's looking for.
to feel helpful.

And not just during the summer.

Let us help you.
we just want to pay for it.
But... but your congregation should build it.
Let them learn what they're capable of.
