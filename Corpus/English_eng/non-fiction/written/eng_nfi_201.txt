Turn it off!
In the Kalahari Desert, the unsuspecting meerkat clan is unaware they are prey to the desert's most savage predators.
- Oh.

Jesus Christ.
Where's the remote?
Could somebody shut off those rats?
Oh, no, no, they're not rats.

Look at them, standing up like little people.
Oh, I found the remote!

Thank you.

- What time is it?

Jesus.

Oh, my God.

Scattered reports this morning that Judy King has been taken hostage at Litchfield Penitentiary in what appears to be a possible terror situation.
- Holy shit!

You tellin' me that we could have gotten up to that roof?
Why aren't we hanging out up there?

Fucking morons.

Is that Yoga?
Change it to Fox.

Absolutely not.
Live at the scene here at Litchfield Prison, as details continue to trickle in about the late-night terrorist attack on Judy King and her Christian faith.
Some reports indicate that there is a political and violent uprising taking place within the prison.
But News 4 has found exclusive online footage that tells quite a different story.
That's where the chicken à la king went.
Mr. Pearson, the governor's on line one.
Hutch!

Why are al-Qaeda terrorists torturing the red states' favorite chef on the roof of your prison?
Uh, look, I know it doesn't look good, but, uh...
It looks like a fucking PR nightmare during my election year.
- Are you storming?

MCC can't have hostage bloodshed.

Is that what CERT advised?
- CERT?

Do you not have a CERT team on the scene?
We're sort of between CERT teams right now.
For fuck's sake!

You listen to their assessment of casualty risk and you let them de-escalate this mess.
I consider you a friend, Jack... but I can't believe how badly you shit the bed on this.
Worse than when my beagle had butt cancer.
I'm so sorry to hear about Blanche.
- Is she okay?

Get your inmates off my TV.
You stepping' ass first?
If you wanna score the Latin and African American markets,
- it's all about that bass.

White, I just turn to the side, tits, ass.
And the schoolgirl outfits hits Asians.
- Shit.

Oh, my God, here they come!
Are you ready?
We're gonna be super famous!
Don't forget to smize.
Nuh-uh.

- Over here!

- Wow!

Pidge said I needed some drama on my face.
It was this or mascara, and I don't like shit around my eyes 'cause I got allergies and I rub and then I look like one of them girls who cry.
- Oh, it's good.

Uh, I'm totally liking it.
You should try doing the prune lips like an Olsen twin, like this.
Mmm.
All right, can we just get the two on the right?
- Other one looks like a boy.

What?

Well, if you don't like my face, maybe you'll like this!
Oh, my God!

Never work with animals, children or naked buttholes.
Why are you walking like you're 90?
Because we slept in a digger bucket, and I can't feel my neck.
I once dated a girl named Digger.

She stole me a ring off a corpse.
How romantic.

She left me for a professional water-skier.
She said she was the only woman who ever looked hot in a life vest.
How do you fight that?
I think we need more padding.

You know, like a...

Whoa.

That's, uh... that's pretty presumptuous.
Alex Vause, may I put my prison-issue mattress next to your bulldozer scoopie thingy, and ride out a nightmare with you?
You may.
Will I not like you when you get very angry?
I'm repurposing.
Huh.
Do you want me to help you rip off the other one?
Is it driving you crazy?
No.
Yes.

- It's hard to look at, huh?

Okay, fine.

It's no corpse ring, but it'll have to do.
Daya!

You found something to eat okay?
Why, you wanna jack me for my Pop-Tart?
Hey.

You're right.

This whole fucking time you didn't say nothing.
And you fucking hit me in my head.

- I got a wicked headache.

You weren't acting like a responsible gun owner.
I don't care.
- I don't care if he dies.

We all think about taking down these cabrones, but we don't act on it 'cause we got things to live for.
You gotta get outta here and see your girl.
Look at me.

You need to take a timeout, okay?
Why don't you help me clean up?

Busy hands could help clear your head, huh?
My head hurts, all right?
I want nothing to do with you.
Maybe your shadow can help you play cleanup.
- My what?

What's for breakfast?
You're looking at it.
Um, no.

Breakfast is supposed to be served between 4:30 and 7:00.
Today's offerings should include a hot grits, a whole wheat bread or coffee cake, a margarine pat and skim milk.
- Sometimes there's a surprise, like...

Breakfast is canceled...
Fine.
Breakfast, okay?
Oh!

This is the surprise, for sure.
Um, by any chance, will there be a spoon made available?
Yeah, I'll get one.

Oh, what the hell.
Okay.

Uh, no.

- I want to apply for a job here.

- You got a sign outside...

No.
I want to work here.

I do manicures.

Oh.
Exactly.

I did my toes, too.

Cheetah.

Yes.

- Great.

What?

- That's way too low.

You pay me to train.
- To train?

In what?
I'd buff circles around these sashimi bitches.
Two weeks train, or you go now.
You know what, you can shit up a rope with your $20 a day.
And it's your loss.
I would have had this place packed, with lines out the door.
Charging people to work?
This is America, lady.

Mei... are you in here against your will?
Come on, slave!

How long does it take to fry, poach and scramble some damn eggs?
Ladies, I am moving as fast as I can.

Did we say you could talk?
Yeah, just make it rain, King.
What the fuck did y'all do?
Did y'all see the news?

We know.

And they had no right to call us bin Ladens without checking who we were under those Ewok hats.
- The whole thing's totally offensive.

What's offensive is that a photograph of two idiots wearing hijabs automatically gets labelled as terrorism.
Hey, do I smell eggs?
Ooh!

No way, she's our slave.
And over easy's nasty.

Bitch, egg snot the best part.
- Splooge-y.

Over easy's the only way to cook an egg.
Ain't that right, Jude?
Over medium is considered the gold standard.
In your face!
Shocking.

Look, we need to borrow D-list Martha Stewart for a while.
We need to show the media that she ain't locked up in a closet with a bag over her head and jumper cables on her nips.
- Whoa!

She's our property and we're not in the lending business.
That's Jews.
Yeah, maybe you didn't hear her.

Oh, so this is communism now?

Nah, our whole lives is you people taking from us for free.
If you want her, you gotta buy her, like an American.
That's the deal.
What do you want for her?
What you got?
Aw, shit!

Yes.

I think Boo's giving tree actually does more takin' away than giving.
- How so?

But when it gets filled with cement, the tree symbolizes what's been taken from Scout, her innocence.
Plus, she's got that dumb name.
Okay, permission slips, people!
I need them before we get on the bus tomorrow.
Uh, Janae, I'd like to speak with you.
Ooh.

Yeah, right.

- Here, I got my permission slip.

I want to make sure you're coming tomorrow.

- Yeah.

Doors are gonna open if you keep working hard, Janae.
I want you to see what's behind some of those doors.
Okay.

Okay.

I go to here, Spanish Harlem.
I know it looks messy and everything, but it's because we have that protest and everything.
My bunk is over there, and right here, we have Pidge and Ouija.
Or Peejee.

- No one calls us that.

Okay, so over here, we have Maria.
I made this selfie stick out of a plunger and duct tape.
Look at the link below if you want directions.
And over here, we have my best friend, Maritza.
- Say hi, chiquita.

I already took my face off from this morning.
- I gotta put a new one on.

For the people.
Tell them what you're doing.

Okay, fine.
Hi, everybody!
Okay, so what I'm doing now is contour and highlight.
When I wasn't in prison,
I would do this with a MAC Pro Palette and a ♪19 fan brush.
But in here, I use three spices that you can find in any kitchen.
- Okay.

Yes, your face will smell like your abuela's pork.
But listen, you gotta make sacrifices if you wanna look DIY fly like me.
First... contour.
Where's the cheese?
Fuck.
What cheese?
I had cheese, didn't I?
Whoa!
Check it out.

Yeah, 'cause the cough syrup's red... and something was blue.
Hey!
Someone stole the fucking gun.
No, they didn't.

- We did?

Oh, yeah.

I'm from Hebei province in China, 56 years old, 108 pounds, and...
I'm annoying as fuck?

- Damn, Ouij!

All right.
All right.
Okay.
I'm from Omaha, Nebraska, 46 years old, 130 pounds, ashy-blonde hair and I'm doing nine for media piracy.
- Who is White Cindy?

Yo!

Yo, we're all on the news, dumbass.
It's good 'cause people need to start taking us serious...
No, my actual ass.

Yo.
Oh...
Really?

- That hoo-ha out, too?

Um, can I help you with something?
Where's Caputo?

Nah, we put him in the Poo.

I'm going to rip his balls off.
Oh, shit.
Oh, this fucking guy again.

Need to go to the bathroom!
I think he gotta go big bathroom.
I think that you need to shut the fuck up.
We gave you a bucket.

A bucket is not a toilet.
Stratman, use the bucket.

You don't understand.

I mean, I can't when there's other people around me.
Since I was a kid.

Please!

I don't know.
God.

Is that that jazz club in Harlem?
What?
No, it's the sound frequency that makes your bowels vibrate and release automatically.
- I saw it on Brain Buzzer.

Hey, Stratman...
- Fuck.

No, no, no.

Oh, stop, stop.

Yeah?

Aleida?
Oh, my God, Gloria?
- What the fuck number's this?

You found a cell phone and you're calling me?
Damn, woman.

We were only prison gay.

Yeah, what can I say?

How's everything out there?
I'm good.

You know, different nail salons.
After they seen my cheetah toes, everybody been fightin' over me.
- You see?

You called it.
How about you?

Yeah.

You all right, girl?

Listen, I gotta tell you something.
What?

Nothing.
I feel like I'm, you know, losing my mind in here.
My grip on things.
You gotta do you, girl.
You seen that sign on the subway?

Do the opposite of that shit.

Keep your chin down, do your fucking time, and don't take care of nobody but yourself.
Oh, thanks.

And Daya, of course.
Don't you be no self-centered bitch when it comes to her.
She doin' all right?
Fine.

Well, tell her I'm busting my ass out here, trying to get us set up, so she better not be pullin' shit.

- Yeah, I'll tell her.

Mmm.

What, you don't like it when I...

No, I like it just fine.
You're just not supposed to be doing anything that I don't say.
- That's the rules.

- You gonna let me lead or not?

- Okay.

Keep telling me what you want me to do.

I wanna do to you what the vibrating phone did.
Seeing you get turned on, it was...
It was so hot.

- You do?

You have got to fucking be kidding me, Doggett.
- What?

Quick, hide.

- Where?

- You can hide in here.

Trust me, I've seen it done.
- Seriously?

Get the fuck in there.
Don't close it all the way.

Hey.
Let me give you a little preview of how this thing's gonna end.
See, any minute now, your boyfriend will be captured, taken to the bubble, where he will be forced to shit in a bucket.
And you'll be lucky if you're not tossed in there right behind him.
Is that what you want?

I don't know.
What could you possibly not know?
I don't know...

Okay?

I can't control the chemicals.
I had to respect the chemicals.
No matter how much I wanted different, I had to respect the chemicals.
Because lye doesn't feel anything until it touches ephedrine.
You know what I mean?
Have you ever...

Of course.
It's called masturbating.
Now, say goodbye and walk the fuck away, son.
God.

Now the Estée Lauder makeup bag is our final offer and if you act now we'll throw in, uh, lightly used Invisalign braces.
Oh, wait.

Mmm.

Hey, my gap is awesome.
I just wanna fix my left pointy tooth 'cause it's a little twisty.
No!

We want land.

The Latinas got a dorm.

- What do the white people have?

Territory is off-limits.
Then you ain't gettin' King.
And... we're taking our stock public.
Who wants to buy Judy King?
- Selling to the highest bidder.

Damn, JK!

Or want you, depending how you wanna look at it.
All right, folks, we got a fine-lookin' piece of chattel up here.
A fine-looking piece of chattel.
Cooking skills.

Go on, girl, show 'em your teeth.

- How do you know how to auctioneer?

I've got an Estée Lauder makeup bag high bidder, Estée Lauder high.
- Do I hear higher?

Does she know how to dress wounds?
- I've got a phone charger!

Stifle it, meat!
I've got a phone charger money bidder, folks, phone charger money bidder.
And... and five ramen noodle packets!
Charger and five, do I hear ten?
Would ya give ten?

Ten cans of tuna!
Ten tuna can money.

Uh, 15 AA batteries.

- I got 20 bottles of beer.

Twenty bottles of beer high bidder.

♪ Take one down, pass it around... ♪
Okay!

Plug in it and everything.

Man, what we need this white lady for?
We wanna go to the press?

Look, you've seen the news.

How are we supposed to get our demands met, and justice for P, if they think we a bunch of animals?
No, they're gonna think that we're animals no matter what.
Don't you know that?
Yo.

A Debbie Gibson Electric Youth cassette tape.
Potato chips!
Lisa Frank rainbow unicorn stickers.
I got an Anne Geddes babies calendar from 2007.
- Huh?

And sold, to the big black one, for the Anne Geddes baby calendar and the other stuff!
What?

Unicorn stickers.
It's art.

Come on, JK.

Oh, thank you, Cindy.
Oh, I guess it just shows you should stay friends with your exes, right?
Do you mind taking this collar off me right now?
Bitch, please!

Now get down!
Heel!
- Shit, we at the White House?

Uh, Janae!

This is Courtney, your buddy for the day.

We are so glad to have you here.
Come on!

Is this your first time in Riverdale?
I mean, it's not like I've ever been to the South Bronx.
Although, my dad did once take me to Arthur Avenue to buy some crazy Italian espresso machine.
He's got this, like, whole coffee thing going on.
This is the south lawn, by the way.

And the garden, obviously.
We harvested a whole bunch of stuff on Community Day and made this giant salad for the PTO.
This is Rocawear, right?
I love it.

Running hurts my boobs, but it burns so many calories.
Maybe I just need a better bra.
We're doing Faulkner.

Oh, so, this is the reading room.

...in the courts.
There's the question of how many correctional officers, staff members...
Sorry.

One peeing, one masturbating and one homeless.
Aleida, you seen this?
It's all over the news.
You have to keep in mind, a lot of these women are mentally ill, sent to prisons because so many of the state facilities have been shut down.
- They talkin' 'bout Litchfield?

Nah.

Maybe the riot hadn't started yet?
Ain't you listening?

She was lying through her fucking teeth.
Fuck!
Where is she?
...often affiliated with gangs and prone to violence.
They have no intention of rejoining polite society.
I feel like I'm seeing you naked...

If and when we storm and there's hand-to-hand combat,
I didn't want any of them to have anything to grab on to.
Still, extreme.
It was a safety issue.
Finally.
We can send these jokers back to Max and get the job done.
- You Piscatella?

- How can I...

Cavalo, Reed, let's get the schematics and assign positions.
And when we get the cars out of here, we got a shit-ton of press and civilians to contain.
- I have schematics for you, sir.

And what I was thinking is, we'd... we...
Need help, Desi?

Voilà.
Your reading nook.
Oh.
- Huh.

Well, I thought we talked about the reading nook being a bit more about reading and less about... clutter.
I like having things around, Piper.
It comforts me.

Why don't you go over there and sit on your dirty yoga mat and admire your... collections?
Do you not want me to be comfortable in our dirt home?
I'm simply asking you if these items spark joy.
According to The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, you should only have items in your home that... spark joy.
- You know what would bring me joy?

- Smacking you.

Larry got off target once, and I did not enjoy it.
- So, hard limit.

Fuck!
What are all these people doing here?
Maybe they like sleeping alfresco, too.
Maybe they're playing follow the leader.
Shut up.
Caputo, you son of a bitch!
How do you sleep at night, knowing that that mother...
Wrong toilet.
- Oh, sorry.

- Caputo!

Hey!
You knew what Piscatella was and you let that beast work here?
In a women's prison?
Hey.

No kicking!

He murdered an inmate!

Red, please.
You have no idea how hot it is in here.
And the smell.

Oh, is it hot?

But at least you're not being boiled alive!
You don't think I've been trying to get rid of this guy, too?
I've been fishing around that same file.

But there was no charges pressed against him.
It went through arbitration.

But where there is guilt, there's recourse.
There's always pins that can be pushed under fingernails.
How do you plan on getting to his fingers when you're in here, in a riot, and he's out there, with no charges against him?
Maybe, if you wish hard enough, he'll suddenly decide to sit down and write a confession called "I did it."
Yes... that's good.
- But that's good...

Red, let's make a deal.

I will write you a glowing commendation for your file.
You helped a warden in a time of crisis.
Red.
Red!
Can you hear me?
I call myself...
Hey, Ruiz!

- He's hyperventilating.

He can't breathe and he's humming Sound of Music songs.
Maybe that's normal for him.
- Part of his process.

Strat, Strat, Strat.

I need you to take some deep breaths.

Good.
Hey, heads up!
- You.

No, not you!

No, no, no!

Please, please take me.

Fucking guy.

- Hey, Ang, look what I found.

- It's Donuts.

Man.

Do we capture him?
We don't got the gun.
Oh, come on.

For real.

My guinea pig got too big to pick up.
On three?
- Let's dunk this donut.

Hello!

Get out of there!
Put your hands up and step away from me, inmates!

Oh, how cute is that?
You're our hostage now, you squirmy little donut fucker.
Donut fucker!
I could totally see him doing that.
Hey, Penn, look!

I see that.

Why are you guys down here?
Well, we were looking for the gun, but instead, we found a giant rabbit pig.
Prison heroes, two days in a row.
Come on, help us take him to the bubble.
Okay.

And show him how he's really done people wrong.
But then, no one would see our victory parade to the bubble.
Damn, I wish we had the gun for that.
Show 'em our colors don't run.
You know, I have a really good idea.
Why don't you two stay here and look for the gun,
- and I'll fucking take care of him?

You wanna steal our thunder!

- Come on.

No, wait.

I just wanna see justice.
All right, I'll...

What do you mean, "which guy"?
The fucking guy you got on your channel right now talking bullshit about "the gang politics of riots."
- Talking out his ass.

Yeah, saying that all the inmates at Litchfield are dangerous?
That they don't want to be rehabilitated?
Everyone I know in there wants to be rehabilitated.
- Okay.

'Cause I'm giving you pro tips here.

Wait, you were an inmate?

Litchfield!

My daughter's still in there.
To confirm, you were in prison with Judy King?
Judy King was in prison with me.
Miss Diaz, can we send a town car for you?
You're willing to go on air with us, right?
Yeah.
Ouch!
I said square shape.
Only Rihanna can rock the round toes.

It's like sawing through an elm.
What was that?
Uh, I said I love working on your feet, Bitch Goddess of Litch.
That's what I thought you said.
Don't worry.

Just as soon as you work off your debts, hmm?
Though... you never did pay me for them Us Weekly photos, now did you?
- Oh, no.

So, it's gonna be a while.
All right, spa time is over.

Oh, hell no!
We ain't even done my asshole hair trimming yet!
Look, I got to spread my cheeks and she gotta get up in there.
Okay.

'Cause Judy need to talk to the press 'fore things swell up out there and he gonna massage her talking points.
Yes, he is.
Now, wait.

I thought you meant that I could write a statement through my people.
I can't go out there like this!

Watson, are we serious?
- What's your name, son?

Uh, big fan, Miss King.

Thanks, darling.

- Now, what's the take?

- You just gonna wanna stick to the points.

"I am not a hostage.

I want justice for Poussey.
I want our demands met."
- That's right.

Now, do you want me to be off-book, or should I go out with this?
Oh, you can have it with you.
And we all think that you should get back in uniform.
- So you look more united.

And so, what do I say when they ask me, "Why were you on the roof with idiots?"
Oh, no, no, no.

Anything they ask, you say, "That's a great question.
But the bigger question is, what is going on in this prison system?"
- Oh, he is good.

Oh, and I personally think it might be helpful if you shared some sort of, um, relatable tribulations from your time in here.
Some painful experiences, uh, injustices...
Uh...
Um...
- We could also lie.

All right, so now, ladies, what would you like me to say?
We get thrown into the SHU arbitrarily.
We're denied proper health care, dental.
I saw a girl with a tooth gone septic, and they still didn't take her to the doctor.
We get beat for no reason.
We get cavity searched for no reason.
We stuffed four in a bunk like we factory chickens.
We can't get clean half the time 'cause there ain't enough bathrooms.
We fed slop.
We don't get paid for our labor.

We're denied the chance to breastfeed our babies.
We're denied basic humanity.
And we get killed in the cafeteria for no reason.
- You got a pen?

You can't let this white woman speak for us.
She needs to take our stories out her mouth.
Come on, man.

They want to hear from her.
And it would be smart of us if we put her out there.
They'll hear more of what we saying if it comes from her mouth.
Yeah, but she's never been a real prisoner a day in her life.
She ain't in mourning.

This is our fight, T.
Ours and Poussey's.
And you're gonna let some fuckin' white woman, like, karaoke our song.
That's fucked.
I got this.
You get to keep the laptops?
No, we keep them during the year and then we return them so that they can update or replace them over the summer.
Oh, so what did you think of class?
I'm sorry we spent so much time on citations.
Erik thinks we need to know MLA, APA and Chicago Manual.
Yeah.
One of these is my brother's.
For chess.

He's at Carnegie Mellon now.

Think about her.
If you help me, I can make sure your sentence doesn't get extended.
Hey, no kicking!
Piscatella already put five more years on my sentence for no fucking reason, all right?
My daughter won't even know my name by the time I get out anyway.
Ruiz, are you sure he put time on you?
'Course I'm sure!
You... you had a hearing already?
- No.

And with the speed paperwork moves around Litchfield,
I wouldn't be surprised if his recommendation is not even in your file yet.
Have you seen your file?
Piscatella, he's a... monster.
He should never have been working here in the first place, and that's my fault.
But you do not have to become the monster he's making you out to be.
I've seen you with the other inmates.
They look up to you.
Huh?

Stratman?
Oh, fuck.
Okay, enough.

What?
Why there is an army of lemmings dressed like you, moving out here.
- You sound insane.

You're gaslighting me right now.
And technically... do you know that's emotional abuse?
Do you know how I know that's emotional abuse?
I read it in an online quiz once, called "Are You Being Emotionally Abused?"
Okay, I may have shared some... some things in my history with a few inmates and it resonated.
- They think I stand for something.

That I killed Aydin.
You told them that you killed Aydin?
I didn't say Aydin specifically.
I just shared my...
I don't know, status as a...

I don't know, it just came out.
We were supposed to take that to the grave.
I went to Von Barlow and I begged her
- to keep it a secret...

So, what?

Do you not want a real house?
It's not a real house if I can't carry my truth inside it, Piper.
And now you sound like a fucking E.E. Cummings poem.
I'm not sorry.
Yeah, it sucks that they turned it into some symbol of the resistance or whatever, but I am glad I said it out loud.
Now, I want to lay down in my tchotchke nook and I wanna relax until this whole thing blows over.
They heard what they wanted to.
They turned it into some kind of a symbol.
What you do and what you say affects people, Alex.
It affects me.
And if you do not curate your shit, you are not a collector.
- You're a hoarder.

Very mature.

I am going to the guest room.
Oh.
I'm from Fresno, California, 46 years old, Puerto Rican,
- doing 11 years for armed robbery...

I'm from North Philly, 5'9", 285 pounds.
I got no identifying marks, and...
Who's Jodi Winkler?
What?
She's like Rain Man.
Yo, you idiots got my file?
Who's Maria Ruiz?
I'm from Kingston, New York.

I got a rose tattoo.
Jessie...
Whoo!
"This prison has put me through unimaginable suffering, and I am not a victim of this riot.
I am an active participant.
Together, we stand united, protesting..."
No.

- Like the Pledge of Allegiance?

"Protesting how unfair this system is."
"How unfair this system is."
No, no.

Yes, yes, that's it.

- You think this is gonna work?

- It's the only play we got.

They sure ain't chanting for Poussey out there.

"The waiter served a dinner roll to the woman that was well buttered."
Come on, guys.
Who can fix the misplaced modifier in that sentence?
Anyone?
Janae?
"The waiter served a dinner roll that was well buttered to the woman."
Everyone?
Do we see why?
Okay, we'll pick up here tomorrow and then we'll move on to dangling modifiers.
Janae?

I need your mom to sign this, so she knows you got a D.
It's hard for me to write grades like this on your work, Janae.
I know what you're capable of.
Whatever.

What do you mean?
I mean, we ain't quoting secondary sources using APA or MLA, and we ain't studying SAT words or growing salad, and we don't even have a library in this school 'cause it got made into a nursery for our fucking hood rat babies!
Janae.
Two zip codes from here they got laptops and art galleries.
They got so much culture, they ain't even knowin' they stealing' ours.
It's a load of shit.
You're right.
I wish you weren't, but it's true.
The Thurston students are privileged and advantaged, and sometimes you feel like you have to work twice as hard to get half as far, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.
Okay?

But why even bother playing' a game that's rigged?
Courtney's going to a science camp this summer that cost more than my dad makes in three months.
How could I ever compete?
I'll see ya, Miss Fowler.
I don't know, you guys.
I just think that we should have a little bit of fun with him, you know, like, torture him.
One by one.

Nah, I don't like that show.

These guard uniforms are itchy.
Maybe we should change them after we dump him?
Yeah!

Mmm, yeah!
Oh, yeah.

'Cause we'll go, like, full circle and remember where we put it.
Yeah.
Freeze!
Put your hands up!

- You stole our gun?

- Angie, are you fucking kidding me?

You put it on your belt!
I didn't even know I was wearing a belt.
I must have put it on when I was fucked up.
Which is weird, because I hate belts.

Intake is your best bet out, okay?

Here, take it.
Oh, shit!
- What the fuck!

Shit.

- Shut the fuck...

You shot my favorite finger,
- you fucking asshole!

- But I can't leave you.

Just go.

- Ooh... fuck.

- Fucker!

You are so gonna pay for this.
- Get her!

What?

Judy.

Judy King, are you a Muslim now?
Judy.

You want me to talk first or make an introduction?
- Judy!

Did they hurt you at all?
Are you in any jeopardy?
Good morning.

Two days ago, our friend and fellow inmate, Poussey Washington, was murdered by a prison guard.
Poussey Washington.
And I'm sayin' her name again because it can't ever be said enough.
Now, as you can see, Judy King ain't injured and she ain't a hostage.
And she has a statement that she'd like to make at this time.
And good morning, my fellow Americans.
"This prison has put me through unimaginable suffering.
- And I am not a victim of this riot... "

She is not gonna be making a statement.
Sorry.
She will not be speaking for us because Judy King can't speak for the inmates of this prison.
She was kept separate from us, held in a private room with better treatment and a seltzer-maker.
And moments after our friend, Poussey Washington, was murdered by a guard for doing nothing wrong,
Judy King was packing her bags to go home on early release.
Because she's rich and white and powerful.
Now, our fight is not with Judy King.
Our fight is with a system that don't give a damn about poor people and brown people and poor brown people.
Our fight... is with the folks... who hold our demands in their hands.
Which you people need to read, by the way, and stop watching this fool shit comin' out of here online and get a hold of our demand list because those demands are fair and necessary, and show that we intend to keep this demonstration
peaceful and focused on change.
Now, Judy King is free to leave.
She's not a hostage and you can have her back.
Judy, get the hell out of here.
Oh, my God.

You fuckin' freed my ho!
Who's gonna tend to my African sunflower?
You ever think about a career in the church?
That was something.
You did her right.
You did our girl right, T.
Open this door!
Open the door or I'll shoot!
Uh, I'm fine.
Hey!

Drop your weapon!
Drop it!
Oh, my God.

Put it down!

Move in!
