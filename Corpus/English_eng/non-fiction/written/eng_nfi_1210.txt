Why go halfway across town to a chemist?
Well, maybe Eddie's supplying him with peds.
Owned by Lionel Cartwright, no priors.
That bottle is a critical piece of evidence in a national investigation.
They found the drug that Tyler was on.

- Lucy...

Absolutely.
Let me go!
Get the fuck off!
Why don't you take your clothes off?

If you could accelerate this matter against Flynn Pearce, sex with a minor?
And the reason you need it accelerated?
Confidential, of course.
NCC, Bonnie Mahesh speaking.
Bonnie, Owen Mitchell.
Maybe we can catch up at the end of the day.
This is Darren.

- Darren's in concrete.

Darren Faulkes.
He's been a major person of interest in about a dozen inquiries.
Could never nail him.
We're talking about very hard people.
And I can help you with them if you just please give me some names.
Did you know that the morning Clay died, he was about to tell us who runs that syndicate?
No, I didn't.
One particular call from Clay Nelson's mystery visitor went to
Maxine's burner the same day Oliver's wide wasn't called.
3x06
Adelaide, hot and 36...
Liam, get your foot off the couch.
I'm on my last shoe.
Alright, Em, that's it - outside to the middle, other side to the middle.
- Good.

No.

Mum, look, it's Graham.
...placed into receivership.
Pax Chairman Mr Graham King is being investigated by the Australian Securities Commission for breaches of the company code.
Mr King is accused of issuing a fraudulent prospectus, misrepresenting the financial status of Pax Car Rentals, an offence that carries a maximum...
- Is he in trouble?

Can you finish my hair now?
Bonnie.
Speed those kiddies to school and get yourself to work quick as.
Have we found Maxine Reynolds?
No sign of the Big M, but you'll never guess who's turned up wanting a chat.
Well, where do you want to start?

I'll start, Mr Faulkes, by reminding you there are serious penalties if you're here to waste our time.
The young bowler who took his own life, Oliver Pittman, boy didn't bowl that wide of his own volition.
Someone in the stand gave him a signal, probably when the odds went from here to Mars.
Yes, we've already come to that conclusion ourselves, so...
But you don't know who gave him the signal.
I do.
Maxine Reynolds.
And what evidence do you have for Ms Reynolds' involvement?
On the day of the A20 match, she wore a flashy, colourful scarf, sat to the left of the players' box and waited for a particular phone call.
When that call came, she took off the scarf, gave it a wave.
Very next ball, young Pittman bowls that uncalled wide and all hell breaks loose.
How do you know all this?
Well, she told me.
We're old mates.
Not very matey to volunteer her name to the National Crime Commission.
I'm no fool, sweetie.
I knew the moment that Graham King told the world to save his own arse that I topped up Nate Baldwin's salary that you would be pegging me as your Mr Big.
Look, I may have bent the rules a little to help my football team along but Maxine, she's a whole other ball game.
I don't trust him.
Darren Faulkes is not of impeccable character, granted...
He's most likely trying to steer us away from him.
Well, however insidious his motivations, his evidence does fit with what we know about Maxine.
Don't you think his timing's slightly suspicious?
I mean, just after Maxine disappears,
Darren pops up offering the final nail in her coffin.
She was at the A20 match.
Where she received a call on her burner phone seconds before Oliver bowled that wide.
And she's linked to all our significant POIs.
If this evidence is confirmed, she's no longer just linked to this world, she's directly involved.
Or Maxine's a perfect fall guy for Darren, especially if she's not here to defend herself.
So Maxine's dead or guilty.
Talk about damned if you do, damned if you don't.
I'm going to the DPP.

Janet...

Yeah.
Brief time!
- Shall we go to Rosie's?

- Geoff!

Have you got any room on your dance card?
Samba?

Sex with a minor.
A tricky style.
Why don't you want to defend Mr Flynn Pearce?
Nate Baldwin's appeal's pending.

Sure, why not?
When you stayed with Flynn at his place, did he have sex with you?
Yeah.
What sort of sex?
You know, sex.
Did he have vaginal intercourse with you?
Yeah.
How many times?
I don't know.

- Most nights?

Did he have oral sex with you?
Sometimes, yeah.
When he had oral sex, was it you on him, or him on you?
Flynn's gonna love you asking him this shit.
He doesn't have to say anything.
How's that fair?

It helps prevent the accused person from potentially incriminating themselves.
So, it protects him?
Well, we call it a right to silence.
A right to...

We, the prosecution, have to make our case against him.
We have to prove he did these things to you.
Yeah, right, so it's all on me.
Flynn's lawyer will try to imply that you're misremembering what Flynn did to you.
Misremember?
Well, that your recollections are imperfect.
He fucked me a lot.

You mean they'll say I'm lying.
Pearl, um...

I'll get us a drink.
Fuck.
You did well.

I don't think it's in Pearl's best interests to proceed with this.
Why not?
Because she's finding it hard enough already.
What's going to happen when she's crossed for three hours straight?
You're preparing her for that.
There is evidence that Flynn had sex with her?
Yeah, but we only have her statement.
Then it's your duty to prosecute him.
Janet, you're her support person, not her counsel.
And I'm supporting her by ensuring Flynn is convicted.
Not if she goes through all this just to see Flynn get a community order.
I've prosecuted a lot of sex crimes.
The judge is likely to regard his actions as non-coercive and nonviolent.
You've seen how a lot of these trials end.
- Why are you pushing so hard?

Her brother's dead, her mum's a drunk, her stepfather's predatory.
Social services are useless.
If you and I, the law, aren't on her side advocating for her safety, who is?
Thank you, for the ball.
Well...

Isn't that gonna be a laugh.
That, um, Lina chick gives me a headache.
Look, it's going to be tough, but I believe in you and I'll be there the whole time, alright?
Yep.
These are good, too.
Just don't know why you have to buy them with rips already in them.
Yeah.
Need something for your head?

Yeah, there's tablets in the bedroom.

- OK.

No worries.
Pearl, um... where'd you get these?
Flynn.
Flynn gave you this Oxycodone?
I grabbed a bunch of stuff from his bathroom.
It's the same.
Identical batch number as the pack left for Clay to kill himself with.
I bet Flynn was the source.

It wasn't him who threatened Clay.
No, it was our mystery man.

So, let's get an ID.

Not yet.

The closer his court case gets, the more chance we've got of him giving us something, if he thinks we can help him reduce his sentence.
He's definitely going down?
Well, Pearl's 15, he's 28.
Unless the jury can't add up.
How did it go with Lina?
Sorry, that's Bonnie.

Bonnie.
So, a Dorothy Gale just booked a flight to Perth.
The name on Maxine's burner phone.
Yep.
Departs in an hour.
She hasn't checked in yet.
And hang on.
From Perth, a Maxine Reynolds is booked on an international flight to Cape Town.
- One way.

How's it going?
Maxine Reynolds' etag just pinged going into priority pick-up car park.
OK, you take the right.
Imagine the pile of parking fines she's gonna cop.
That's the least of her worries.
Bianca, she can't get on that plane, alright?
We've only got a notice to attend with no outstanding charges.
- What's happening?

Got her.

Shit.

- Stop!

- Stay where you are!

Maxine Reynolds!

Get out of my fuckin' way!
Police!
- Hey!

Ooh!

Stop!
Fucking get off me!

What was your involvement in the betting scam that led to Oliver Pittman's suicide?
Whoever was behind that scam had access to Clay Nelson, Oliver Pittman and Nate Baldwin.
Someone like you.
I didn't do anything.
You gave the signal at the A20 match that destroyed a young man's life, contributed to Clay Nelson's death.
All I did was take off my scarf.
Which is ironic, because from where I'm standing it looks like you're in this up to your neck.
- I didn't do anything.

Why try and leave the country?
He'll kill me if I stay.
Who's he, Maxine?

Ms Reynolds?
Darren.
Darren bloody Faulkes.
OK, what's the nature of your relationship with Mr Faulkes?
I've known him on and off for years.
In a social sense?

Romantic?
You're lovers, aren't you?
Well, on and off.
So through you, he did get access to Clay Nelson and Oliver Pittman.
Well, at the beginning, I I thought this was just about money.
No-one was getting hurt.
I mean, even when Oliver and then...
When Clay died I tried really hard not to believe that Darren...
But he did, you see, and now he wants my help, again, and all I ever did was get 10 grand, two dead clients and a whole lot of grief.
He wants your help for what?
I don't know.
I don't know!
What does he want you to do?
Just give him names from my client list.
I smiled.

"Sure, Daz." I gave him the names, I walked away.
But I knew then that I had to get the fuck out of Dodge or I'd end up under a bus too.
OK, has Mr Faulkes made specific threats against you?
No, but he'll know.

Find out about what?
That I've been talking to you lot.
Just like he found out about Clay.
Alright, Ms Reynolds, should this matter proceed to trial, you may be required to repeat your evidence.
No, I'm not testifying.
- Ms Reynolds...

If you don't follow the directions of this commission you'll be found in contempt and jailed.
Whoop-de-fucking-do!
At least I won't be dead.
And that's what happens when you cross Darren Faulkes.
Now, you ask Clay.
Ask Clay about that.
Please.
I'm begging you, just...

For my life, let me go.
Please.
We can't keep her in the country anyway.
And even if we could convince her to give evidence,
Darren paid for the scarf thing in cash, so there's no paper trail connecting him to Clay or Oliver.
Her word against his.
Jaz, in the past 48 hours, thousands of new online betting accounts have been opened across several companies, and not one has placed a single bet.
They're waiting for something.
Faulkes' next big sporting fix.
He's going to do it again.
Asleep?
How many fingers and toes have you got to cross?
After Amal and the DPP, are there any hours left in the day?
Once you sacrifice sleep, it becomes very manageable.
Andy's going to cut back his hours, and I want to sit the bar.
That's great.

Convincing.
You and Ben took the bar no problem.

- Did you want a tea?

OK, spit it out.
What?

How do you do that?
You've always been terrible at hiding things, Richard.
It's one of your charms.
What have you done?

No, a client's wife.
I mean, she isn't even really a client's wife.
She is his wife, but he'd sacked me before I before we...
And I haven't again, not since that night, and especially not since the client rehired me.
I was joking.
- Who is it?

Is it Lucy Baldwin?
Am I that transparent?
I saw the way you looked at her at the charity auction.
It's funny you mention the charity auction.
Ever since that night...
You know Pearl Perati?
Yeah, I'm prosecuting the guy charged with having a sexual relationship with her.
That incident where the footballers groped her, that ended up online and led to her brother's fight with Nate?
I saw it happen.
OK.
I mean, I was right there, Lina.
I was not five metres away from a girl being sexually assaulted and I...

Just stood there.
I knew I should have said something or done something, but I just did nothing.
- Bystander effect.

I always had this idea that while I wasn't exactly Superman,
I was at least a half-decent human being, but I...
You're not a bad person, Richard.
You're not.
In fact, you're such a very good one you're not used to it when you behave like the rest of us and make an error of judgement or two.
So, you need a date for the Premier's drinks?
You want to rub shoulders with the politicians.
Might make some useful friends.
Friends or mutually beneficial contacts?
If you want to put it that way.
In what way are you beneficial to them?
Well, one, young and attractive, two, wildly intelligent, and three, I speak Mandarin.
And we are in the Pacific Century, so...
- The whole package.

So, by accepting your invite, I'm really doing you a favour.
What about the director of public prosecutions?
Convicted any major crims lately?
The case that's taking up most of my time is radicalised youth, but incipient terrorism's hardly a problem compared to the forces of evil in lawn bowls and badminton.
Hey, the NCC does important work, too.
And Queen Janet's still the cleverest person in the room.
You betcha.
Though, she kind of is.
She drives me nuts and I will shoot myself in the head if I ever become that uptight, but she's bloody smart and she has a great wardrobe, and, man, she is a dog with a smelly old bone.
Just digs and digs till she's sniffed it out.
Janet the obsessive canine.
And is her bone shaped like Darren Faulkes, by any chance?
I can't tell you that, you cheeky shit.
Cheers.
Lina seems to think Pearl won't cope, but she's a lot tougher than anyone realises.
You'd have to have an iron will to get through what she has.
Anyway, it's good.

So, the apartment isn't really a long-term option.
Until she's 16, it's her only option.
Well, it's not.
She can't go back to her alcoholic mother, and share houses for people her age are just drug dens and she's not old enough to get a lease for her own place, so...
There are other options.

Shelters are for short-term crisis accommodation.
Fostering takes months to organise, so...
Hang on, didn't you agree that the apartment was the only option?
No, you'd already made up your mind.

OK, can you think of something better?
- No.

I just wish you'd talked it over with me first.
OK.

It's not about the money.
It's the sort of decision I thought we'd share.
Graham, hi.
I had a meeting in town, with a lawyer, as it happens, so I thought I'd pop around and see how your champion sprinters are getting on.
- We saw you on TV this morning.

Your mother wasn't allowed to watch TV during the weekdays.
It was news, actually...
What have you got there?

We're making pesto.
Real, from leaves.

Do you want some?

I'm sure he's very busy, so...
A man's got to eat, and since it's not from a jar, let's go.
- Come on, Liam!

Um, you'd remember Bianca?
Yes, of course.
I'm surprised you two aren't sick of the sight of each other.
- Hurry up, Graham!

Wow.

And if you take some out...
- It's higher.

- The pitch is higher.

Yeah.
Alright, that's enough symphonies, OK?

- Say your goodnights.

Goodnight.
Great pesto.
- Thanks.

In amongst all this being bankrupt hoo-ha,
I've realised there's a few more bits
I should pass on to you people, you know.
- Concerns Darren Faulkes.

You need to come into the commission, then.
Give your evidence under proper conditions.
Good, yeah.

I'd better be on my way too.
- You're not driving.

No, it's alright.

- I'm fine.

Stop fussing, would you?
Well, stay here, then.
What, with you?
Yeah, yeah, if it stops you killing yourself or someone else.
Well, I do have another early meeting with my lawyer, so, I accept.
Great.
I'll see you in the morning.
- Goodnight.

Come on, it's not as if we're going to sit around talking about the reference all night.
Janet, you shouldn't be talking to him at all.
What, so I just let him drive?
Well, if he's going to give more evidence, I can't be here.
Tony will have conniptions I even stayed for dinner.
You need to understand.
This... this is very unusual.
You don't know what it's been like between my father and me.
You're right, I don't know, and I did need to understand.
It's another thing it might have been nice to have talked about.
This Security Commission inquiry must be very stressful for you.
Would be if I thought I couldn't win it.
And how often did the defendant have sexual intercourse with you?
Every night.
During the day, too, if he was there.
Did you ever refuse?
I tried, but if I didn't sleep with him, he would have chucked me out.
- How do you know that?

Thank you, Pearl.
Miss Perati, how did you come to know Flynn Pearce?
Through my brother.
And how did you come to stay in his home?
After Tyler died, things at home were no good, so I messaged him.
Would you mind giving us some more details?
Was this message sent via social media, or email?
It was Hook Up.
Hook Up?

- A phone dating app?

And you had your own Hook Up account?
- Yes.

Yeah.
Ms Perati, how old are you?
- 15.

Which is why we are all here.
Your Honour, could the witness please be shown this document?
Ms Perati, is this the sign-up page for your Hook Up account?
Did you check the box that affirms that you are 18 or older?
Ms Perati, did you check that box?
Yep.
You represented yourself as being above the age of consent, didn't you?
No further questions.
You said Hook Up wasn't your first contact with Flynn Pearce.
Um...

What were the circumstances of these meetings with Mr Pearce pre-Hook Up?
Once I was waiting for Ty outside the footy club and Flynn was there too, and he came to see Ty at home a couple of times as well.
What were the circumstances of other meetings with Mr Pearce?
I was at soccer training and Ty picked me up, and we were in a cafe and Flynn came in.
Do you remember what you were wearing?
Um... my training gear and my rep jacket.
And what age division were you?
Under-16s.

Do you remember how your brother first introduced you to Mr Pearce?
He said, "This is Pearl, my little sister."
His "little sister".
Yeah.
Thank you, Pearl.
But if they do acquit, then there goes the leverage on the Oxycodone.
About that, I've been doing some digging.
Flynn Pearce studied medicine.
Dropped out in his third year, but not before doing a stint as a student at the Greater Southern District Hospital.
The hospital where the Oxycodone was stolen from?
I'd call that leverage.
I'd call it circumstantial, but useful.
The mystery phone's turned on, the one used at Clay's place the night before he died.
Been dead as corduroy flares for weeks, but just now, bing!
- Where is it?

That's why I asked.
Cartwright Pharmacy.
Same place Eddie Cooke visited when he was hunting drugs for Zoe DiCosta.
Coincidence?

Let me know if it moves.

There's nine people inside - pharmacist, three staff, five customers.
Given it wasn't a woman or an old bloke who threatened Clay,
I'd say those are our three likelies.
What do you reckon?

Let's flush him out with a wrong number.

Right.
Hello?
- Is that your phone?

You answered it.
A man gave it to me.
Eddie Cooke?
You know about him too?

Did Eddie Cooke give you this phone?
No.

We have an arrangement.

As a compounding chemist, customs checks on my packages aren't as rigorous.
What about the phone?
Dear God.
A few weeks ago, a man who I'd never seen before came in and said I was to change the order to include some other substances as well.
Safrole, formamide, PMK.
Precursors to MDMA.
He gave me the phone, he said when the chemicals arrive, turn it on and call a preset number.
Are the precursors here?
Behind the toilet rolls.
- Have you made the call?

I was getting ready to and you guys arrived.
That man, you see...

He said if I was to make any trouble,
I would have to choose between killing myself, or him... killing my granddaughter.
So, the only real question you've gotta ask yourself is this.
Who do you love more, yourself or your son?
Was that the man who told you to import the precursors?
Yeah.
But you can't describe him or recall his eye colour, age, hair?
The stress.
I'm...

OK, the number he was given to call is registered to a false name.
In fact, all the numbers this phone has ever called or received are registered to false IDs, including Maxine's Dorothy Gale.
The only legit one was your father, the night Clay got monstered.
So, whoever's phone this is is the invisible man.
A voice but no face.
Have we got a trace on this?

Make the call please.
Please.
OK.
It's ringing.
Cartwright Pharmacy.
Yeah, um...

OK, when?
That wasn't him.

Senior Constable Page will take you back now, Mr Cartwright.
We've got a watch on your family, so don't worry about that, and whoever comes to collect the precursors, just behave normally.
- We'll do the rest.

Thank you.
Darren Faulkes hasn't got convictions for amphetamine production, does he?
He's too clever to have convictions for anything.
If he is making money from MDMA, it's arm's length.
And even though he knows we're watching him, he thinks he's cleverer than we are.
Thinks we haven't twigged to this particular string to his bow.
Plus he must need the cash since the spot bet on the wide fell through.
We've got tracking devices on the precursors.
- Have to see where they take us.

See if the jury's back.

- Later today.

Are they back?
Well, if they'd accepted the Hook Up defence without question they'd have acquitted by now.
Janet!

- Hang up the phone.

So, guess what bunny has...
So, guess what bunny has to listen to all the listening device files before archiving or destroying them?
Tell me.
Put those on.
Lucy Baldwin's house, four nights ago.
God, don't stop.
- Are you sure?

You're so beautiful.
Lucy.
It's him, isn't it?

Richard.
Archives or bin?
It's personal.

That's what I thought too, but it's your call.
Archives or bin?
Archives.
You told us your relationship with Mr Faulkes extended only as far as you facilitating ex gratia salary cap payments from him to Nate Baldwin.
I'd like to add to that, as long as what I say remains confidential.
The NCC's not in the habit of blabbing about our sources.
If, however, the matters proceed to trial, you may be called.
Right, last season Faulkes approached me asking me if I'd be interested in being involved in match fixing.
Which matches?

Cricket, footy, soccer, any sport connected to the Pax Sport Foundation.
And what did Mr Faulkes ask you to do?
Keep an eye out for any young players who may be interested in supplementing their...

He wanted you to act as a spotter for up-and-coming athletes he could corrupt.
You could put it like that.
And did you do as he requested?
No.
We've heard Mr Faulkes is difficult to refuse.
I laughed at him and he never asked me again.
Mr King...
He asked me on the 23rd of March last year.
We were both on the balcony of the Australian Club.
It was a Devils function.
You can check my diary.
We've got no hard evidence, no paper trail, no idea how Darren launders the millions he makes from the betting scams.
Bonnie's fine-tooth-combed his finances.
- No sign of any hidden cash.

Your father's evidence was useful.
I'll leave you to it.
Do you have plans for the evening?
Leftovers.

You're welcome if you can stand pesto again.
How was your meeting with your lawyer?
Expensive.

We're not all driven by money.
No.

Apparently you have an altruistic streak, too.
I assumed you were around somewhere, listening at the keyhole.
That bloke Gillies, your boss, do you think he'd put a good word in for me?
A good word?

Well, a letter from the NCC attesting to my good character, my sense of civic duty, might keep the Security Commission's dogs at bay.
So, that's why you came in today, to get off those charges.
Two birds, one stone.
Always got an agenda, haven't you?
You've always got something planned.
I always make the most of my options.
- Right.

Here I was, thinking you were actually going to do something for someone else for once.
Don't be so childish, Janet.

Shh!

Keep watching.
Remember his pain.
Remember your fear.
No more questions.
You and your daddy, you're gonna be very, very quiet from now on.
You're gonna be as silent as the grave.
Good girl.
Graham.

Dad!
OK, thanks.

God, Janet, are you alright?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Your father?
Fractured ribs, bruised spleen, concussion.
He was lucky that was all.
What did he try to do, defend his wallet?
No, it wasn't a mugging, it was a message.
From Darren Faulkes.
It was the man who threatened Clay and the pharmacist.
I didn't see his face.
That voice.
He told me, you know, not to ask any more questions, and his mates, they just kicked Dad to pieces.
A few moments earlier I was so angry with him
I wanted to kick him myself.
He only gave evidence to curry favour with the Securities Commission.
It doesn't make his evidence false.
No, just his motives.
He's such an old bastard.
Hey, Dad.
Could the foreperson please stand?
On the charge of having sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 16, how do you find the defendant - guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
I'm sorry.
No, it had to be that Hook Up thing.
There's no other grounds for acquittal.
Don't forget, we've still got Flynn's connection to the Oxycodone we found at Clay's house.
We can use that to shake him up a bit.
Yeah, but a guilty verdict would have made our life so much easier.
What do you mean, made your life easier?
Bianca, I've got to go.
You put me through all this shit for something to do with your work?
The NCC does have an interest in Flynn over another matter.
Look, but first and foremost, I wanted to see him convicted because what he did to you was wrong.
He got off.
Nate Baldwin.
He killed Ty and they just let him out of jail.
I did explain the drug that was given to Ty led to his...
You knew this was gonna happen?
- Look, Nate's punch...

I don't wanna hear it, Janet.
Any of it.
Nate got off, Flynn got off and now they can go have a laugh about how they both fucked the Peratis.
Fuck.
I owe you, mate.

What are you going to do now?
Not play footy, that's for sure.
Yanni and the Devils are in the crap, Mitchell's gone to smoke.
I haven't heard from Maxine in days.
I need a new trade, an honest one.
Maybe I'll become a...

You're the only ones who have stuck by me.
You and Luce.
Um, we should go.
Thanks again, mate.

Yeah.

Love you, sweetie.
He's been practising tricks in front of the mirror.
Bad day for the prosecution?
Better one for the defence.
It's a function of my pathological insecurity - women won't like me unless I rescue them, be useful, somehow.
Well, rescuing's not necessarily a bad urge, especially if there are dragons in the area.
You know who really did need my help?
Pearl Perati, and I failed her.
So did I.
Do you want to watch some Play School?
Yeah.
Your father's recovering?
He's got a hard head.
Maybe it runs in the family.
Someone's picking up the precursors from the pharmacy.
- Are we connected?

Wayne, we're listening.
Definitely old Hazelnut Hinksman doing the honours.
He's on the move.
Hinksman's gone into Antonioni amp;

Suspected links to the Calabrian Mafia, and 'Ndrangheta, out of Griffith.
Sale time.
Who should I follow?

Hinksman will be collecting, what, about 500,000 for the precursors?
As Tony says, we follow the money.
Stay on Hinksman, Wayne.
I'll get a second team to watch the Antonionis.
Shannon Hinksman's back at the St Peter's warehouse full of cash and burner phones.
There's another car parked out front.

Holy dooley!
What?
It's the arsonist.
The bloke we reckon torched Wazim Jandaphur's place.
He's carrying.
It's a semiautomatic, by the look of it.
When they come out, what's the call?
Hazelnut or the arsonist?
Well, everything we know about Hinksman so far says he's just muscle.
The other guy's a blank slate.
A blank slate who burns down houses.

Only if we do it without alerting Faulkes we're onto him.
He's carrying a concealed weapon.

We don't want to reveal that we've been watching him.
Or that we know about the warehouse.
I'll traffic stop him for a broken tail-light then arrest him for the gun.
- Does he have a broken tail-light?

Now he does.
Shit.
Wayne, what's going on?
Ooh!
It's my knee.

What about the target?

No, no, I don't think I can.

It's a blue station wagon - Charlie, Golf, 4, 8, Sierra, Bravo.
If we don't get a tail on him now, we've lost him.
Shit.

No, I'm behind his car.
OK, Wayne...
Wayne, do you have your phone on you?
- Yeah.

Jeez!
Is it in?
It's in.

He's on the move.

Your left tail-light is broken.
It is?
Get out of the car and have a look.
I believe you, mate.
Get out of the car, have a look.
Well, fancy that.
You wanna show us your licence?
Gun!

- Hands on your head!

- Get on the ground!

Hands on your head!

It's on his right hip.
Hands behind your back.
You're a bit of a dark horse, aren't you, Mr Wesley John Foster?
On your feet.
Who ordered you to set fire to Wazim Jandaphur's house?
- That's not me.

No jury would believe otherwise.
Actually, you know what?

And what did you do after that?
Went to a mate's barbecue.

I certainly didn't burn down any houses.
This isn't helping you, Mr Foster.
The only way you'll help yourself is to cooperate, otherwise I will keep you locked up, indefinitely.
Who ordered you to threaten Clay Nelson's child?
Induce Mr Nelson to suicide?
But, Clay, you've been under a lot of pressure lately.
I mean, all that guilt over Oliver, it must be really eating you up, mate.
I'm sure everyone would understand if it all got too much.
You've gotta be fuckin' kidding me.
It could look like an accident.
You didn't mean to take too many.
You just wanted everything to stop for a little while.
I'm not doin' that.
Actually, fuck it.

I'll bring...

Careful, Clay.
If you do that, mate, we're gonna kill your son.
His school looks really nice, Clay.
How dare you threaten me?
That's your choice, Clay.
And it's all you got.
Like hell it is!

Get the fuck out of here, you fuckin' gorilla!
You're gonna be very, very quiet from now on.
You're gonna be as silent as the grave.
We need absolute certainty.
So the only real question you've gotta ask yourself is this - who do you love more?
Yourself or your son?
You think that's me?

Well, it's obvious to us.
I don't know about obvious.
Similar, maybe, yeah, but nah, nah, it's not me.
Mr Foster, do you really think such a blatant lie would hold up in a court of law?
Well, it all depends on how good the voice recognition technology is, yeah?
Last time I checked, not much chop.
His prints are on the Oxycodone, but charging him with threat to kill means further showing our hand.
Well, we certainly don't want Darren Faulkes to know the real reason his chief enforcer's off the street.
State Police will need to follow up the concealed weapons charges.
I'll take it to the DPP.
Wayne called.

He'll be out of commission for weeks, no pun intended.
He's gutted he won't be here for the kill.
Doesn't matter how long we keep Wes Foster locked up for, he's not going to tell us anything about Darren, who meanwhile is getting ready to ruin another young life.
We always knew bringing Wes in was a calculated risk.
Well, at least he's in remand with no chance of bail.
Could we get an undercover cop in, infiltrate Faulkes' world?
Proper undercover takes months, years, even.
Turn someone on the inside?
Someone who already works for him?
Time line for that's massive, too.
Identifying possible targets, researching their weaknesses, turning them.
If we want to break open Darren fast, we need someone he already trusts, someone outside his inner sanctum who can ingratiate themselves because he believes they're compromised.
Well, if anyone can name this particular individual who'd be so useful to us, I'm all ears.
I know someone.
God, don't stop.
- Are you sure?

You're so beautiful.
You're so beautiful.
Full disclosure -
Darren Faulkes has made millions through corruption in sport.
He's also responsible for arson, assault, drug importation and at least three deaths, that we know of.
Does this make your request one that I can't refuse?
Of course you can refuse.
This is just in the interests of full disclosure.
We're merely asking you to consider your reputation and your commitment to justice.
Only someone Darren trusts can bring him down.
And we'll take every measure to prevent him from linking you to us.
Nice shot.
Room for a fourth?
What's your handicap?
Off 10.
- Welcome to the club.

So, how can I help?
Well, I was hoping we could help each other, and I don't want something for nothing.
Nate, come on.

You've gotta remember, the circumstances...
Nate!
How can you feel you don't owe me some kind of explanation or apology?
I'm being straight with you, Darren.
You fuckin' better be.

Don't underestimate her.
Never.

- We have to consider aborting.

Well, an order to kill does change things.
He still might be useful tomorrow, but after that, we don't him walking around.
