Grr!
This is an outrage!

They're very popular, sir.

Well, I demand you hand 'em over or I'll supply you with a laser blast!
Not my best wordplay, but you didn't give me much to work with.
(Evil laugh)
- Drop the Num-Num, Eggman!

Let's see how you do against my largest creation yet, the tremendously terrifying, and cleverly named, HugeBot!
Knuckles, gimme a boost.
- Yeah!

I keep building larger and larger robots to combat Sonic and his dopey friends.
But all that's gotten me are larger and larger scrap piles!
And HugeBot was the most worthless of all!
- Oh, that's not true, sir!

You two are the most worthless!

If going big isn't working...
- You should go even bigger!

I need to go small.
But you tried, that's what matters.
Using micro-nanotechnology, these FleaBots can turn the most hygienic foe into a bumbling, itchy mess.
Ooh!

(Yelps) My FleaBots!
(Marching music)
Now, I need you two blank tapes to plant these on Sonic and those cheese-faced chinchillas.
Well, here we are at Meh Burger, even though we don't eat food.
Just two robots enjoying the elegant atmosphere
- of a half-star eatery.

(Spy-thriller music)
Heh heh!
Ready to be impressed?
(Shrieks)
Whoa!
I'll drill a small hole and drop the FleaBots inside.
Sticks will never even notice.
Who's there?
(Chuckles)
(Chokes)
(Laughs)
There's the gang.
Better play it cool so they don't know I have fleas.
- 'Sup, peeps?

No shameful hygiene problems here, that's for sure.
- (Nervous laugh)

Hey, check out that hideous stain on the floor!
That's not a stain.

I'll get that!
Better get some more ketchup.
Ugh!
- You guys got fleas too, huh?

Ah, the heck with it.
- Where did they come from?

I keep my dilapidated shack spotless!
They probably came from Amy's old rug.
It's not old, it's vintage!
And it's too expensive to have fleas.
Sticks lives in a hole in the woods.
A shaman cast a pest-control spell on the place years ago.
Everybody, please!

It was Knuckles!

How dare I besmirch my good name, sir!
Guys, it doesn't matter who started it.
That's what patient zero would say!
- Oh, this is just delicious!

- Not the food, the plan.

Have you seen the clean spot, by the way?
Oh, these fleas itch even worse than that poison-ivy deodorant I've been using.
Wait.

You can't bring flea-infested pelts into my shop.
You're the only store in town that sells anti-itch lotion.
Can you bring it to us and we'll pay for it out here?
All right.
(Alarm)
Freeze, fleabags!
You perps are gonna have to vacate the Village immediately.
- Are you banishing us?

We're quarantining you.
It's like a banishment, but more confined.
I guess this isn't so bad.
The town's turned on us for less.
That's true.

"Warning.

- and night terrors."

Ah...
Aaah!
Uh...

Come on, Amy.

It's not like anybody's going to see you.
Argh!
And continuing our walking tour, here's Tails' house.
Oh, and inside there's Amy Rose wearing a flea collar, not unlike an outdoor cat.
Oooh.
(Evil laugh) Yes, minions, take all the Choco Num-Num Bars you can carry!
Help!

And why aren't they here to save us?
(Nervous laugh)
(Knock on door)
Congratulations!

I now un-quarantine you!

Now, if you wouldn't mind, Eggman just tore up the village.
You ever think maybe you guys should do something?
You are police officers, after all.
Hey, that's enough lip from you!
We'd love to help but I doubt we'd be much good right now.
Yeah, we've tried every potion and powder we can find, but nothing works on these fleas!
Maybe they're not fleas.
I was so busy itching, I never considered that.
Well, hurry up and figure it out.
The Village won't save itself, ya know.
Especially with my brother-in-law in the police.
Eh, what are ya gonna do?
These aren't fleas.

We may not know how to destroy bugs, but we know exactly how to destroy robots!
With brute force!
- Ugh!

Aiming for the FleaBots.

Completely understood, my good man.
Whoa!
(Battle cry)
Aaah!

Oops, sorry!
Don't take it personally.
I was going for the FleaBots.
Not the face.

- Only two?

Hmm.

More scientific than punching?
These are programmed to work remotely.
All we have to do is find the controller.
And I've got a pretty good hunch where that might be!
Hand over the controller, ya lousy...
You know, now I think about it, it's probably at Eggman's.
Mmm.

(Crash)
You can't come in here!

Seriously, some people!

We know your game, Eggman!
Now hand over the FleaBot controller!
Oh, this old thing?

Can someone scratch my back for me?

Oh, yes.
(Eggman laughs)
I can't take it any more!
Whoa, dude!

Let's see how these fleas thrive in moustache hair.
(Marching music)
(Sighs of relief)
(Yelps) Get 'em off me!
So, is this remote the only way to stop the FleaBots?
Pretty sure.
(Laughter)
(Yelps) Mombot!

(Groans)
It probably wasn't wise to eat all those Choco Num Num Bars.
Now you have a tummy ache.
Less talking, more slathering.
(Scratching continues)
