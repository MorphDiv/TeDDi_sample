Somebody opened the door for her.

Maggie:

Eduardo:

Why?
Think about it.
Okay.

We want warmth so they'll put out shoots before the fast freeze.
That way, we pull back the tarp, they die naturally, saves on all the endless weeding.
Get to tarping.
You got it, boss lady.
Uh, wait.

I, uh...

I need some help here.
No, you don't.
I saw a wild blueberry bush growing outside.
If it's young enough,
I'm gonna pull it up and replant it here.
Good one will produce for over 40 years.
We got to start acting like we'll be around that long.
Cool.

Just tarp.

I'll see how you do after.

I'm glad you came.

I know you don't want this.

We can hide like these people, we can keep trying to serve The Saviors, and I can watch you get randomly beaten every so often, or else we can fight.
So, here we are.
And being with you, well... it makes abject terror tolerable.
I should've tried harder to stop Rosita and Sasha.
If they'd have just waited one more day...
Well, Sasha's a good shot, and Rosita knows how to take care of herself.
Probably back at Hilltop right now.
Least I hope so.

There's a whole lot of people still got to die.

Probably overkill, but you did cause one hell of a fracas last night.
Oh, shit.
I remember you.
Yeah.
You were there.
Oh, hell.

I got to hand it to you.
You've got some beach-ball-sized lady nuts on you, coming in all kamikaze like that.
Big question here, and I need the truth on this one...
Did Rick put you up to this?
Rick?
Your bitch?
No.
Either way, you must've thought it was gonna be the end, coming in on your lonesome like that.
But that's not the way it's got to go.
Unh-unh.

See, this...
Well, this could be the beginning.
This knife is yours now.
You can try to use it, take me out, but considering I am standing above you, holding a baseball bat, that doesn't seem real smart.
Now, you can use it to slit your wrists, which would be a damn shame, but I get it.
You're obviously not on the shiny side of the street, given recent events.
Now, you can sit there and do nothin', wait for ol' David to come back to life and eat your face, also a damn shame and kinda nuts, but, hell, to each their own.
Or you can use that blade and stop ol' Rapey Davey from becoming Dead-Alive Rapey Davey, save yourself, join the cause.
I know what I'd do.
What?
I'm a man short.
Hell, you can't really call this piece of shit a man, but still, I'm short, and you got those beach-ball-sized lady nuts, and I wanna harness the heat comin' off of 'em.
You can help me run this place one day, all of us together, following the rules, workin' on the same side of things.
That's all this was ever about.
And it still can be for you.
I know it's hard to picture, considering what I did.
But, Sasha, we all got shit to get over.

What did they do to you?
They're keepin' me safe.
I brought you some creature comforts.
Full disclosure, the pillow is not hypoallergenic.
There was some debate as to whether or not I should come in here.
They said in the event of a hostage situation with the pig sticker that I would fully be on my own.
Just wanted to share that.
Negan relayed to me his offer to you.
It's my opinion that you should accept said offer, just as I did.
I know it's a hold-your-nose situation, but taking up with the management here was indeed the correct select.
You know, I believed I could be brave, that I could be a survivor like Abraham was, and ridin' that RV into the sunset was... some of the greatest 37 minutes of my existence.
But I know now that I was full-tilt delusional.
I have never in my life been as scared as I was that night in the woods, kit to the grit, fully believing my number's about to be called, then seeing it happen to someone brave... to a survivor.
And then the pants-pissing terror of the rinse and repeat of that very same event...
I just...
I couldn't.
Being here means I'll never have to again.
And neither will you if you just say "yes."
Please say "yes."
He would want you to.
He wouldn't.
I do.
We're still here.
Things have changed.

We have to.

Well, I built these walls to use them.
If I want greenery, I eat a salad.
Then why are you here?
I was hoping we could talk.
Then I saw you come out here alone.
I was concerned.
Where are your friends?
They went out.
They're looking for something they need.
Without you?
Now, I'm just wondering...

Hmm?
With Carson gone...
I heard you were gonna get him back.
That not true?
Was it just something you said?
Maggie, you've got to start trusting me.
You know, people are tense, they're worried.
Everybody'd be a hell of a lot better if... if we could present a-a united front.
It would be a lot easier if we actually were a united front.
You're right.
I need to be more open to working together.
I apologize.
I never intended for things between us to come to this point.
I appreciate that.
It's never too late to change.
You know that?
If you're serious, I'll come by later and we can talk more.
Fine.
Great.

I mean, yeah.
Gonna go clean it.
Okay.
Tara:

Stay quiet and put your hands on your head.
We should've just killed you in the village.
You're gonna be glad you didn't.
You're not alone, are you?
Sit.
What do you want?
I want you to sit.
Tara:

You promised.
Yeah.

Put your hands on your head.
I didn't have a choice.
Why are you here?
Tara:

But you do, both of you do.
My friends are out there right now, and they're gonna take this place, hopefully without firing a shot.
What?

What are you talking about?
We need your guns.
What?
We're gonna fight The Saviors.
- You should join us.

The Saviors killed your fathers, your brothers, husbands, sons, and you ran from them.
I thought we got rid of them.
Beatrice said there was more out there, and she was right.
They came back.
They killed my friends.
They killed my girlfriend.
They took us over.

We do whatever The Saviors tell us to do, and they think we're still doing that, but we're not.
We're gonna fight them.
And we have other communities beside us, and with Oceanside, we would have an army.
So, that's it?
"Thanks for the guns.

If we fight them together, we can beat them.
We have to try.
They'll win, Tara.

Just talk to the leader of my group, Rick.
Just talk, and we don't have to take over this place.
We don't want to.
I can give them the signal to stop this, but you have to tell me right now.
Listen.

We're doing something.

I didn't want to break my promise, Cyndie, okay?
But the world can belong to good people, to fair people, if we're all just brave enough to try.
We are not good, and we are not brave.
Neither you nor me.
She is.
That's why we're in this mess.
Look, Tara, if you take our guns, you might as well be killing us all.
That's what you'll be doing.
We should talk to them.
No.
We can try to stop this.
No, Cyndie.
It doesn't matter.
You can't.
