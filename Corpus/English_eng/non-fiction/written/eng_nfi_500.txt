Hey, Vic, you should take a look at this, mate.

Do we have an idea whose gold this is?
Yeah, we do.

I'll get them to share that gold, one way or another.
- So, what's going on?

He's called a job on.

What else are we transporting other than the Heimels, Mr. Gold?
Diamonds.

Where can we have a little fun around here?
What kind of fun are you referring to?
Who's heisted my diamonds?
I don't know yet, Mr. Gold.
I want my diamonds back in 48 hours, or I will cut off your cock.
Christ.
How we gonna write this shit show up?
Way it happened, Bob, is we burst through the doors to be greeted by a crew of hopped-up gangsters blazing lead in our general direction.
What the f...!
It was us... or them.
Right.
Us or them.
Lads.

I'll call in the paramedics.
- What you do that for?

Cost per prisoner per year.
Now, say this shithead gets 20 at Her Majesty's pleasure.
You're asking the taxpayer to cough three-quarters of a million quid.
That's unconscionable, mate.
All right.
Let's see what Vic Hill's been up to.
- Bingo.

Bang up job, boys.
Gold must be worth millions.
Gonna be front page news.
We'll get commendations for this, gents.
Sorry to be the one to break it to you, Bob, but there'll be no medals or marching parades for this one.
- Why?

You make a shit criminal and a shit copper.
What's left for you, Bob?
Sod all!

How the hell did Castillo know about the diamonds?
Come on, Charlie.

Sonny probably owned the joint.

Let's just tell Saul Gold who heisted him.
He'll get the ice back and redecorate El Flamingo with bits of Sonny's skull.
But Sonny ain't Saul's problem, is it?

We guaranteed delivery, so we gotta sort this shit out.
Well, bar selling selective body parts, we only have two viable options...
Either we fence some of the gold and raise the cash... or retrieve the diamonds.
Retrieval.

She can work with us from the inside.
We go in hard, we go in heavy, and we light the place up.
She's a hot mess.
You need to wipe your glasses, pal.
They've come over all misty.
Yeah, son, if you've got any better ideas, then share 'em.
Yeah, we fence some of the gold... without sparking the enthusiasm of the local criminal fraternity.
The girl working at Saul's...

She knows the business.

I want those diamonds back.
Let's take Lotti Mott for a walk, shall we?
Everything go to plan?
What's your boy done with my diamonds?
- Come again?

Your boy says that he got turned over, which as a result has put me and, conversely, you a quarter-bar in the red.
My boy wouldn't rip you off, Saul.
He knows what's what.

Vic, in the meantime, all those privileges you enjoy in that shithole that make your miserable existence marginally less miserable are revoked.
What did you do, son?
What did you do?
So, you want to raid El Flamingo, get the stones back, and you want me to work the thing for you from the inside?

And what's in it for me?
- Well, we cut you in.

No, no, no, no.

- Then what?

I want to hear him say it.
- Gold.

- I knew it!

Listen, no word to anybody, all right?
This is some seriously heavy shit.
This is some heavy shit, all right.
All right.

- Equal partners.

You're a junior partner.

Good luck with Saul Gold, boys.
All right.
All right.
Equal partners.
Hate 'Em.
Hate 'Em!
- What?

You top it up?

Should be fully loaded.

Mine's gone down as well.
Come on.

Bingo.
What you got there, Fink?
Fraud case.

The Harrods Hamper Caper.
- Yeah.

You know, a little birdy told me you spoke with the armored truck driver.
Truck driver?
This bullion robbery is strictly Flying Squad business.
We're on it.

And if I found out that you've been tailing our investigation again,
I'll kick you square in those raisins that you call bollocks.
Message received.
Loud and clear.
Hey.
Good boy.
Hello.
These are staff quarters.
Strictly off-limits.

- I'm not here for the party.

What are you doing?
- Who are you?

Well, will you kindly state your business, sir?
I'm looking for a pair of monogrammed slippers.
Sir, I don't know what you are referring to.
I would like to see proper identification.
Shift.
My gosh.
Hello, gents.
This is what you're up against.
I left something in the safe room.
I can't let you in there, Lotti.
Manny.
Please do one little thing for me.
You're always there when I need you.
Could you open up the safe room?
Think I left my knickers inside.
We were...
Sonny likes to... in the safe room...

All the angles, if you know what I mean.
Don't be in such a rush, Manny.
I'll come and find you later and you can fill your boots.
Must've left my knickers somewhere else.

Thank you for that.

I just gave you the layout to Sonny Castillo's safe room.
Now, what's the plan?
Well, that's something that we need to discuss internally.
Without you.
- Your boss is a dick.

- Cheers, bro.

Well, your mate... that bosses everyone around is a dick.
If you want to turn Sonny Castillo over, you're gonna need me.
You're gonna need me in all the way.
I can work this thing from the inside whilst you lot play silly safecrackers.
She's not wrong, Al.
And you can keep Sonny distracted, can ya?
What do you think?
Boys, mark this down.
If you're not seen back in here in less than two weeks, send Brian round and drag him out to 'em yard.
You have to cut your hair regular, you know?
I'm after a fella called...
- Windrush.

I hear he can help with pest control.
Ooh.

You can take Henry.
Okay.
I'll take Henry.
Shit.
What you wearing those for?
Lucky slippers.
- Relax, boys.

- What you done now, Charlie?

Nothing a bottle of scotch wouldn't fix.
We're gonna need a proper safecracker.
Yeah, all right.

Come through.
Bollocks.
This is medieval, this is.

Got a long reach, this Saul Gold, isn't he?
He's not bloody God, Hate 'Em.

- Really?

A visitor?
There he is.
The prodigal son.
- You all right?

Saul Gold, quarter of a bar in rocks, on our watch.

There were some extenuating circumstances.
We got rolled.
You're a Hill.

And you've done 15 years 'cause you didn't pay your council tax, is that right?
You are clueless as to the repercussions of your extenuating circumstances.
Saul Gold is a murdering bastard, and you and I are both nose deep in the shitter, Son.
- I'm going to handle it.

I need something from you.
Do you want me to wipe your ass?
I need you to put me in touch with a safecracker.
I need the Ace.
Norman Gordon?
Last I heard, he was blasting out gangster tours on Limehouse Lane for a living.
Is that it?

Where is my hug?

Oi.

Oi!
And on this very spot... just outside the Crown and Anchor Pub, was the infamous scene of Jack Pot and Regis McLemore's first scrap with the Old Bill!
This incident led the boys to realize...
Led the boys to realize...
So began a life of crime.
Piss off!

Last time I saw you, you had a snotty nose and scabby knees.
Now look at you, Albert.
- All grown up.

Come on, it's been a while since I've had scabby knees.
- How's your mom holding up?

Not easy, being on her own.
Raising a kid and husband locked away...
It takes its toll a marriage.
They... they all right?

Yeah.
Tell me, there been much... demand for your services as of late?
Pfft!

No, I've long been supplanted by the hacker whiz kid.
Effing new school guys.
See...

Yeah, but it turns out I may have a job... for your specialist expertise, Norman.
Steady as he goes.
I've only got 20 quid on me.
I don't want your pocket change.
Tell me... where are your slippers, boy?
Slippers?

D.I. Fink.
I know what you did.
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
No?

I don't know about any slippers, but I do know my rights, so either arrest me or piss off.
You know your rights, do ya?
What about my rights?

Video clip has a male, 5'10, wearing the monogrammed slippers of the Cavendish Clan at the site of an armored truck heist two days ago.
You're Albert Hill's mate, a wannabe gangster in a little silly bow tie.
I want that gold, boy.
And if you don't bring it to me...
I will come for it.
Eddie?

Governor's wife loves the ivory lace.
These bi-weekly palm greasers are hell on inventory.
Albert must've bust his chain.
Just this way, sir.
- So sorry.

Mugger.

- Awful.

Thank God.
Those gold ingots were just enough to cover it.
- You managed to fence them?

- Run into any problems with that?

Won't come back around.

I'll get this.

Are we...

Well, that would depend on if you guys had any more to offer.
What if I told you... we have substantially more to offer?
I like the sound of that.
And Saul?
How would he feel with such an involvement?
I could work as an independent contractor for this particular commission.
It's on me.

Lily?

- Can you hear me?

Sounds like a bus station.

I'm on a landline, so mind your "P's" and "Q's."
What's happened to the mobile?
They put a squeeze on my amenities.
Listen, are you still sending the posies to those that matter on the inside?

Two bouquets a week.

If my sweeteners aren't sweet enough, maybe we should just call it a day.
You've only got a few months left on your sentence.
You can do that standing on your head.

Can it or I'll stripe the lot of ya!
You were saying, my sweet?

Don't get gate fever.

Understood?
Vic, do you hear me?
Oi!

- Vic?

Loud and clear.
So, what are you after, Billy boy?
Your job, pal.
It's open.
All right, then.
Shit.
Hello, big boy.
What a sweet ass?
I'll leave this one with you while I keep Sonny occupied.

Lotti!
Bubbles with your bubbles, baby.
What's all this?
We've been fighting too much.
I thought we should make up.
- Come here, baby.

- Games first.

Okay, baby!
I'll set up the tiles!
Let's get 'em good, Charlie.
Norman.
Norman.

What are you doing?
Just a sharpener.

Right, yeah.

I don't think I can, Albert.
Wait a minute.

You're not sure about what exactly?
Who've I been kidding?
I'm a rusty gun.

- Okay.

Come on!
Woo!

Come on, you little prick!

Come on, you pikey!

When I win, I'm gonna eat you like a ripe mango.
If our relationship's going to last, we need common interests.
We've got common interests.
Focus on the game, baby.
My dad used to tell me stories about you when I was a kid.
Yeah.
He said there wasn't a lock you couldn't pick or a safe that wouldn't yield to your mastery.-
- You were my hero.
I drew a comic strip about you for my school project.
- Yeah?

"Norman 'The Ace' Gordon," I called it.
"Steady as he goes."
- Norman "The Ace" Gordon.

You are Norman "The Ace" Gordon,
King of the Safecrackers, returning for one last caper.
Now... go out there and secure your place in criminal folklore... forever.
Let's crack this bastard!
Your will, I say.

- Another bottle.

Okay.
- You all right?

Fuck me.

Right, well, you crack on Norman.

You see, some fools are always punching above their weight.
And sometimes some wankers never see it coming.
Jesus.

Told you I had it covered, Al.
You're welcome, Billy.
- Twat.

Go on in, drag him out.
How we doing, Norman?
Norman "The Ace" Gordon.
Bollocks!
- What is that?

Leave it with me.
Wakey, wakey, Johnny boy.
- What?

Bananagrams!
What the fuck?
Shit.
Bloody hell.
Norman!

Get out of here, Albert!

Nobody turns over Sonny Castillo!
Run.
Go!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Bastards!
Well, that went well, didn't it?
Why did he try and blow the doors?
I told him...

What are we going to do about him?
We'll have to go back in.
- Hate 'Em.

Where's our friendly screw with my hot water bottle?
Should've been here a half hour ago.

No.

Vic.

Oi.

What's the crack then?

You forget about me?
Listen, Mr. H. There's been a change in protocol, a crackdown on liberties.

Don't be silly, Bert.
There's always something to be done.
Orders from up on high.
Now, be a chap, take it on the chin, and get back in your cell sharpish.
I'm Vic Hill!

Riot squad, feed through.
Tried to warn you, Mr. H.
Prisoner 42718, Hill, return to your cell immediately.
- Or what?

Please, Mr. H. Do as he says.
Jog on, or you'll catch it first.
- Wrap him up, boys.

Come on, slag!

Striking a screw!

Come on, I'll kill the lot of ya!

I'll kill the lot of ya!

I'll kill ya!

Come on, you slag!
Come on!
Now then, 42718, contrary to popular belief, I am a man with a generous and giving nature.
- Bollocks to ya!

We don't take that kind of behavior lightly.
Now, it's either the Shitter... in which your punishment will be of the digestive variety.
Or the Sleeper, in which you will slip into a vegetable state with your tongue dripping off your face.
Give me the Sleeper, you bastard.
The Sleeper.
Are you sure?

Give it to me!
Sleep tight, dickhead.
The Sleeper.
Are you sure?
The side effects can be a bit... mental.
Give it to me!
Sleep tight, dickhead.
Who you working with, old man?
You'll never crack me.
Forget about him, boss.
It was Lotti.

- Son.

- Hello.

Hello, hello, hello.
Albert.

- What's up?

Found what?
He found some more plant food, so we're good on inventory.
All right.

- Is everything all right?

- Remember, I'm here if you need me, yeah?

- Get him out of there!

Shut up!
We are gonna get Norman out, 'cause a Hill does not leave a man behind.
- All right?

Then I've gotta get straight with Saul, 'cause I'm gonna end up a bloody eunuch.
We're getting squeezed from every direction.
We need find a way to move some of this gold to raise the cash to pay off Saul.
- Actually, I...

- Is this bad timing?

- What is she doing here?

I can fence your gold.
How does she know about the gold?
How the hell does she know about the gold, Charlie?
Look, someone had to take action, okay?
You're 24 hours from the pickle jar.

You know there's not a fence in town willing to take on that kind of heat.
Who said anything about staying local?
Your passports up-to-date?
- Passports?

New York.
