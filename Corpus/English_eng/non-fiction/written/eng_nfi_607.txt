Previously on "Blood Drive..."
What better place to test a passion potion than the uptight little hamlet of Meadeville?
So what, this is some sort of sex plague?
Christopher, wherever you're keeping him, he's a good Cop too.
I knew you wouldn't abandon me, buddy.
You got your boy on the inside.
Guys, "Blood Drive's" getting picked up.
We got future episode outlines.
Yes, I will take it down to The Hall of Secrets.
Karma was transferred from Kane Hill to the Claireview Rehabilitation Center for Women.
I've rerouted the next leg to take you right past it, but if you're the last one across that finish line, rules still apply.

So, um... about last night.
I mean, with us.
I was under the influence.
So I just don't want things to get, you know, weird out there on the road.
We're, you know, got it on lock.
But only because I'm in a kick-ass mood today.
I'm gonna see my baby sister.
I just think we make a good team, and I don't wanna mess that up.
You really think we make a good team?
Yeah, I think we complement each other.
Sort of the way a left-brain, right-brain work together.
You know, you're tough and street-smart, and sort of, uh... a murderer.
[rousing orchestral music playing]
Good morning, Blood Drivers.
Forgive my absence.
Last night's excitement left me in a sticky situation.
[chuckles]
Pretty sure that some of you out there might just be able to relate, but this morning we begin with the most frightening words in all of Blood Drive:
There's been a change of plan.
For the first time in Blood Drive history, we're racing directly through the Savage Land.
Drivers, start your engines.
[engines turning over] [grunts] [rock music]
What do... what are you...
You make it too easy.
Lighten up, Barbie.
We've just got grenades in our heads, driving blood-drinking cars through the wasteland in order to find Karma.
Piece of cake.
