You are the leader.

Rita was a ranger, too.

But she betrayed us.
Wanted more power.
She lost her way.
Now she is just pure evil.
You must bring them back.

You must train your team to stop Rita before she has the strength to find the crystal.
Okay.

You know that, deep down, what I'm saying is true.
You were born for this.
You all waited.

She's new at school.

We have English together, right?
I've been at Angel Grove for over a year now.
We have biology together.

But somehow... we were all in the same place at the same time when Billy found those coins.

You ask her four questions before she's even answered the first.
Because she's like a ghost around here.

- June...

- Speak!

Okay.

Okay, Trini, let's start over.
Please tell us one thing you did today.
Me and four kids from Angel Grove found a spaceship buried underground.
What?
I'm pretty sure I'm a superhero.
Cool.
Not cool.
Pee in that cup!
This to remind me of my screw-up?
No. (SIGHS) Wrecking yard only offered me 300 bucks for it and... you know, the frame's straight and the engine still runs.
Figure I'd leave it up to you to decide if you wanted to fix it.
Oh, shit.
OFFICER:

It's a terrible situation.

NEWSCASTER:

- Bodies were discovered...

This rash of violence has the town on edge.

JASON:

ZORDON:

You must never use your powers for personal gain.
You must never escalate a fight, unless your enemy forces you to.
And you must never reveal your identity.

To assume your ranger identities, you need to morph.
Have any of you morphed before?
Yes.

Okay, okay.

Let's try this.
Standing in this circle as a team, you can easily connect to the morphing grid.
Do you feel it?

No.

ZORDON:

(GASPS) I knew it!

Jason!

Cool.

ZORDON:

You bring it out by connecting to each other and connecting to the morphing grid.
Clear your minds and focus.
Power Rangers were a legion of warriors sworn to protect life.

ALPHA 5:

(ALPHA 5 GROANS) KIMBERLY:

What?

Alpha 5, why didn't they morph?
Yeah, I don't...

Very disturbing.

We don't have time.
If they can't morph, what are we supposed to do?
ZORDON:

- They need to prepare.

Sir, that'll be very painful.
Take them down to the pit.
(SIGHS)
All right, follow me.

Jason, I don't wanna find out what the pit is.
So this is the pit.

ZORDON:

ALPHA 5:

- What exercise?

ZORDON:

They're called Putties.
You must get through them to get to her.
BILLY:

Cool.

- Like a video game.

If Rita becomes strong enough to build her army, it'll be the beginning of the end.
Rangers, welcome to training.
I'm so excited you guys are back.

Aim for the center mass.

One more time.
Come on, duck the punches.

(GRUNTS) Oh...
Let's go a couple o' hits, okay?

No, let's try it again.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

ZACK: 'Cause we haven't been concentrating...

Don't tell me to concentrate.
Just follow my lead.
Let's not fight with each other.
TRINI:

(FRUSTRATED GROAN)
Come on.

The information we need to triangulate the location of the crystal was lost in the battle.

Billy, are you listening to me?
Billy, what are you doing?
Billy!

Where's the crystal?

Where's the crystal?
(GRUNTS) There.
One, two...

DRIVER:

One, two, three...

NEWSCASTER:

Residents of Angel Grove are feeling the shock.
Fear has the town on edge.
This series of murders has police baffled as police have linked the loss of gold to each crime scene.
What is now being dubbed "Angel Grove's Gold Killer"
is still on the loose.
...Rita manages to create Goldar...

(GRUNTS)

ZACK:

You keep making this harder.

Feel free to throw us a bone at some point.
Yes, I see you busting your "asses."
So I've decided to give you some inspiration.
What you will find beyond this wall will forever change your lives.
Come on.
(ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY)
The Zords!
Pretty cool, right?

They take on the form of the most powerful organism on the planet.
When these Zords formed, dinosaurs reigned supreme.
They will be an extension of you.
And their power... is all but limitless.
(BILLY WHOOPS, LAUGHS)
But you're not ready for this power.
When you morph, your armor will make you one with the Zords.
So come on, let's go train.
Today's the day you become rangers!

- Okay.

Yeah.

(ZORD ROARS)
(ZACK YELLING)
This was a bad idea.
Okay, okay, uh, signals, brakes.

JASON:

- Do it again!

Billy, how'd you do it?

Okay, we don't know how.
ZORDON:

If you can't morph, you are not rangers.
Go home.

JASON:

Damn.
KIMBERLY:

ZACK:

Make a fire.

I'm down.
All right.

ZORDON:

There must be a way to free me from this wall.
Yes, but the irony is, is that you need these rangers to morph.
If they morph, you can harness that energy to regenerate your body and come back through.
(GROANS) There's got to be another way!

ZACK:

Wait for us dumb kids to morph so that you can come back to life?
That's what all this has been about, right?
You coming back?
This has only ever been about protecting the crystal.
Rita could be building Goldar as we speak.
- Don't underestimate me or my team.

She will have him dig up the crystal and life on earth will die.
And we need you.
Because you were so successful at stopping her last time.
I died burying those coins in hopes that they would find the next real rangers.
Those who are worthy.
Well, sorry to disappoint you.
I don't need to stand here and have you tell me what I did wrong.
- I can go home and get that.

To help lead this team!
Your team's dead.
And you're just as scared as we are.
These... are all 24 karat gold bands.

How'd you morph?
I don't know.
What are you guys thinking about when we're trying to morph?
(IMITATES ZORDON) You must shed your masks to wear this armor.
(ALL CHUCKLE)
(IMITATES ZORDON) Think only of each other and the morphing grid will open to you.
Yeah, that's better.
Well, maybe it's because we don't know each other.
Maybe that's why we can't morph.

No, I'm serious.

And I am a Power Ranger.

Truth, I live in the Melody Mobile Home Park.
It's just me and my mom.
And my mom?

But my mom, she's sick.
I do what I can, but... but I'm scared.
Sometimes I get too scared to stay there at night, 'cause... 'cause I'm afraid she can't make it.
And if she goes... when she goes,
I got nobody else.
Look, (CHUCKLES) I think being with you guys is good for me.
Let's do that.
Let's tell our secrets.

Okay, I got a secret.
I like country music.

No, matter of fact, I love country music.
(ALL LAUGHING)
And I don't...
I don't miss my dad as much.
I mean, coming to the mine with him was all I had.
But coming to the mine with you guys is just as good.
Yeah.
Bigger secret is why were you in detention?
- I blew up my lunchbox.

What, it was a accident, okay?

Of course.

Boom goes the lunchbox, in detention goes Billy.
But let's not forget that Kimberly Hart was also in... in detention, too, so...
Not tonight.
Skip me.
What about you, dude?
Why don't you tell us who you really are?
Because everyone knows exactly who I am.
Okay.
What about you, crazy girl?
I could tell you anything and you'd have to believe me.
Okay, um...
I'm the new girl.

Three schools in three years.
What's crazy is I like it that way.

Nobody ever has to get to know me and uh, my parents don't have to worry about my relationships.
ZACK:

Yeah.

Girlfriend troubles?
My family is so normal.
Too normal.
They believe in labels.
They'd like for me to, um...

Talk more.
Have the kind of friends they want me to have.
It's just...

(INHALES SHARPLY)
And I've never said any of this out loud.
Well, it's cool.

Am I?
What does that mean?
When all this is over.
Are we Power Rangers or... are we friends?
(TRINI GASPS)
(GASPS)

(BREATHES SHAKILY) Yes.
I was once just like you.
So pretty.
Innocent.
Are all the rangers on Zordon's new team as young as you?
(GRUNTS) (RITA YELLS)
Delightful!
(TRINI YELPS)
Have you morphed yet?
Trick question.
If you could morph, we'd be having a very different conversation.
(SNIFFS) Mmm.

Should I kill you?
I killed the Yellow Ranger... before.
And I loved it!
Oh, you want your armor.
I'll show you mine, if you show me yours.
(BREATHING RAGGEDLY)
(TRINI GRUNTS)
No, please, you're hurting me!

(CHUCKLING) I'm just kidding.
You've got spunk, little Yellow.
I see myself in you.
I was an outsider on Zordon's team just like you.
All I need to know is, where is the Zeo Crystal?
(GASPING) I don't know.
Sadly, I believe you.
Tomorrow, I am going to destroy Angel Grove.
But, in exchange for your life, you will find out where that crystal is, and you will come to me.
We can have a little deal,
Didi, my friend.
(TRINI GROANING)
Shh!

How did you get in here?
I'm a superhero.

Is everything okay?
I think I'm the reason we can't morph.
I haven't really been honest.
Okay.

And he was right.
Well, that can't be true.
Okay.
Whoa.
- You took that picture?

Amanda Clark took that picture.

But she shared it with me.

And you sent that pic to... to Ty?
With a text that said,
"Is this the girl you wanna bring home to your mom?"
Oh.
I didn't realize how mean it was until I saw her face.
Kim, there's literally thousands of photos going around school.
I don't care about them.

I had to sit in Mr. Detmer's office with Amanda's father and watch as they showed him that photo of his daughter.
In his eyes, for the first time, I could see who I'd become.
You know, so I lied.

I wanted to die, that's why... that's why when you asked me to run away, I was ready.
Okay, listen.

- Jason, it can't be erased.

You did an awful thing.

Just be the person you wanna be.
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
KIMBERLY:

I'm here.
Look, Rita came to my house tonight.
- What?

Insane.

She nearly killed me.
She was trying to get me to join her.
She said she'd spare my life, if I could keep a secret.
What secret?
At dawn, the destruction of Angel Grove begins.
This is real.

No, it's not.

She said to meet her where the dead ships live.
Okay.

Let's go.

(SCOFFS)
Are you serious?

Jason, we're not even Power Rangers yet.
I say we go back to Zordon.
Okay, the only reason Zordon wanted us to become Power Rangers is so that he can come back to life.
What makes you say that?
Because he told me.
Wait, so this all is a lie?
Of course it was a lie, Billy.
We failed.
Let's stop being delusional about being a team of superheroes.
We're all screw-ups.
And as much as I hate this scrubby, bullshit town,
I don't wanna just sit around and watch it die, okay?
Let's go and do the one thing that's been asked of us and kill Rita.

You know this is a really bad idea, right?
The worst.

One of you does.
Who could it be?

No.
He dies in three, two...
Okay!

(GASPING)
Don't hurt my friends, all right?
It's at a dining establishment.
Where?

It's a Krispy Kreme.
- Krispy Kreme?

This is a special place?
- Very special.

The source of life itself is buried there.
Thank you, Blue, for being so weak.
Zordon would lose all respect for me if I don't kill you.
At least one of you.
