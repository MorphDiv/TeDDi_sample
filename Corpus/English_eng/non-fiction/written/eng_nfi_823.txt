Ever since the announcement, we've had a large number of Hairies come forward for the initiative.
Well, you're making us both look good.
Grab your stuff.
I need to know who or what that is.
It's a power not to be messed with, boy.
Anyone who's caught in its blast can no longer move on from this life.
(SCREAMS)
Well, you've been dealing with this your whole life.
But it's moulded you, shaped you for this role.
You're ready for this.

Wait.
I can't keep up this pace.
Wait.
What are you doing?
I can walk.
(SCREAMS)
And I'm sure it's not a random attack.
No police.
Of course.
Whatever happens, she mustn't be taken to a hospital, subjected to a barrage of tests.
I understand.
Street surveillance cameras would have found them.
Won't take me long to track them down.
And get that footage off the CA system.
We don't want them anywhere near this.
Consider it done.
I'm worried about my baby.
Do you speak English?
Please, please let me go.- -
I looked after your people in the city.
Please don't go.
Don't leave me here with him.
Oh, God.
(DOOR OPENS)
Have you got a minute?
How can I help?
Anything you'd like to report?
The other creature.
The thing with the blue light.
You were going to investigate and get back to me.
He... didn't kill any of those men, did he?
Are you suggesting it's not dangerous?
Not at all.
I'm just gathering as much information as I can.
If you can't tell me what it is, what it wants, how we can deter it?
Trust me, Minister, I will find a way to stop him.
Let me know if there's any developments.
That prick's trying to wipe us off the face of the earth.
He's pumping Hairies full of chemicals.
Makes them lose their hair, their strength.
All you've gotta do is volunteer, play nice.
Eventually, no CA.
Well, then, we need to stop him.
And that fish was so big, so big, that whenever it moved its fin, huge waves would crash against the shore.
You telling her lies too?
I'll finish it later.
Don't do this here.
You killed my parents.
Stoned off your head.
Driving a car with your own son in the back.
What kind of person... mother does that?
Did you plan it?
Huh?
Deliberately set the whole thing up?
Answer me.
Koen...
I'm so sorry.
That's it?
"Sorry"?
What the hell was that?
I don't even know you.
Koen, listen.
She's sick.
Uncle Jimmy.
Unc!
Uncle!
Uncle Jimmy!
You knew.
Waruu knew.
So was it everybody except me?
You all lied to me.
My whole life.
I grew up in bullshit!
Tell me you've found them.
Cameras tracked them all the way through the city, but then we lost them after they left sector 534.
Lost them?
They've travelled west out of the city some hours ago.
Highway patrols?
They weren't using roads.
But she's still alive.
West could mean mountains.
Well, can you show me?
How do I find her in there?
You'd need an army.
No-one's seen Latani?
No.
Maybe she found a way out.
We need to believe that.
After Djukara...
Our boy.
I have to go.
Boondee.
I understand why you gave up hope.
They forced me.
I never would have chosen this.
A word?
Of course.
The polling results are in.
We've dropped several points on average.
Granted, there's a drop in competence across the board, but responses to your specific appointment and performance, well... it's not good.
You're not invoking faith in the electorate.
They see you as an ineffectual poster boy.
Opinion will change once we start getting results through.
Convince me to trust you.
If you have seen these subhumans or Hairy sympathisers, contact your local CA branch immediately.
Hurry.
You have entered a prohibited area.
Go!
I said drop the weapon.
(GRUNTS)
Mum!
Stop!
You bastard.
You've been with Jimmy.
Yeah.
The old bastard showed you the accident, didn't he?
You have every reason to hate me.
Yeah, I do.
He showed me something else too.
What's that?
Muya.
Anyone who gets caught in the blue blast, their muya gets trapped.
Anyone?
Yeah, anyone.
Oh, if the cancer takes me right now... there's no reunion for me with the ancestors.
Yep.
I'll take that as a compliment, darling.
Thank you, boys.
We'll take it from here.
I'm sorry.
Let 'em go.
Stand down, Dolan.
They're just kids.
The woman...
She's the one I told you about.
(LAUGHS)
Oh.
Well, I never would have expected that.
Turn around.
These subbies are ripping out people's hearts, and you're supposed to be stopping them.
Get in the car.
What are you going to do with me?
You know they'll be looking for me.
Where are you going?
Wait!
Why are we stopping?
Why are we stopping?
You can have your woman.
You can't separate them.
You are in no position to negotiate.
I'll take them in for processing.
Oh, man, you can't do that!
Listen, sunshine.
Take the deal or I'll report you.
Your call.
Wise man.
Mum!
Mum!
Where are they taking them?
You being locked up won't help, alright?
Alinta, I'll come for you.
It's an outrage.
Must be beside yourself.
Nothing.
Well, the Containment Authority should handle this.
We really don't need news of it getting out.
This footage has already been edited into a package for broadcast.
Look, I understand this is your wife, but this is also a terrorism issue, national security.
Wouldn't you say the public has a right to know the serious danger it faces?
I would say the public has a need to feel assured they are safe and protected from terrorism by the government.
But they're not.
Do not broadcast that footage.
The last sighting of that Hairy and my wife was in sector 532, which would suggest they're headed for the mountains.
How do you know which sector?
I want full clearance for Steve Mclntyre.
You're blackmailing me.
I'd like to think of it more as a strategic alliance.
The government and Slade Industries have worked together before.
Well, perhaps this might persuade you that we all want the same thing, Minister.
That's from one of your CA surveillance cameras.
Some sort of superpower, roaming the streets.
A new kind of Hairy.
The government hushes it up.
Give full access to Steve Mclntyre.
And I want whoever gave that footage to Slade.
I don't care what rules you have to bend or break.
Waruu West.
He's the first place you should look.
(ELECTRIC RAZOR BUZZES)
(DOOR BEEPS)
My partner, he took the two young females for processing?
The human and the Hairy?
There's no Hairy prisoner recorded.
Can I have a quick word with the young girl?
I've gotta follow something up.
Sorry, she's being interviewed.
I'd say she won't be going anywhere tonight.
Give me a call when she's done.
Dolan, 249.
Did he mention a way to get my muya back?
I think the muya can only be re-entered if someone's dead.
I have to wait?
You should kill me.
I don't know if I can bring you back.
That's not it.
I can't heal right anymore.
This is Waruu, isn't it?
I messed both you boys up.
I thought cancer was my punishment, but I should have realised it was bigger than that.
I'm condemned to live alone for eternity.
Aunty...
It's alright, boy.
I don't expect anything from you.
Things are as they should be.
I guess we've got nothing to lose if we give it a try, then.
Your friend, Tim Dolan, gave you to me.
That was nice of him, wasn't it?
Not sticking with your own kind.
Preying on weak, innocent humans.
Selling them your sob story.
I'm not afraid of you.
Good.
Well, we're going to have a little fun, then.
Not if you were the last thing on earth, darling.
You're probably crawling with lice.
So, how fast are you, subbie?
I want to see you run.
I'm sorry...
You're going to need a lot more than that.
Are you ready?
One...
Two...
Three..
(GRUNTS)

(GROANS)
(ECHOING VOICES)
(GROANS)
(GASPS)
(MUTTERS)
Come on, come on.
(GASPS)
Shh, shh... (LAUGHS)
You alright?
That calls for a smoke.
(LAUGHS)
I've helped them.- -
You will stay here.
As long as it takes.
Please.
I can walk by myself.
I can walk by myself.
Thanks.
Been searching for your girl?
Yeah.
One day, you won't come back.
You know that.
Until I know she's...
I gotta keep trying.
Sometimes, you've got to learn to live without them.
I'll die before I let that happen.
You probably will, looking like that.
She'll never even know you tried.
I've got none left.
And look at me.
First day I walked without fear... was the day I walked out of that clinic.
(FOOTAGE REPLAYS CONTINUOUSLY)
I think I have something you might be interested in.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)
Been looking for your man, the creature.
And?
Nothing on his movements.
Got another lead, about to follow up.
Elaborate.
I think I know someone who can help.
And who is that?
What?
Took her, out the front of the house.
Know where she is?
No.
Same clan as our initiative man, Boondee.
Bilamunju.
You should have told me you had this.
Of course, without the Cleverman, it's just a stick.
All this is useless.
It has a pulse.
One drop of Koen's blood activated it.
Now, nothing can damage it.
Nothing.
Except this.
But I don't know how yet.
May I?
It's organic.
Once plant material and now, through petrification, stone.
It's amazing.
It was liquid when I took it.
Is that so?
Strange.
(PHONE BUZZES)
Waruu West.
Don't do anything until I get there.
Gotta go.
We're working together now, aren't we?
I'll bring it back.
We'll lose valuable time.
Turn it back into its original form.
It'll be my pleasure.
Where's my daughter?
Alinta West was found in the company of a Hairy.
That's a serious offence.
That offence needs to disappear.
Your daughter's details are not in the system.
Then how do you know the girl you have is my daughter?
She told us... after some argument.
If you've hurt her in any way...
And all of her details now, including her crime,
Release her to me under house arrest, put a security tag on her.
I'll take you.
(DOOR BEEPS)
(DOOR UNLOCKS)
Thank God you're alright.
How stupid are you?
Nice to see you too, Dad.
Does your mother know what you've been up to?
Tell me.
I have no idea.
We all got split up when we were arrested.
I need to find Latani.
I'm not losing you again.
You didn't lose me.
You're sick.
You want this back?
It's yours.
You're in a good mood.
Are you coming?
Maybe you're not such a prick.
Whatever you said to Linda worked.
Good one.
Getting any better?
No.
Any news on Nerida and the girls?
Mustn't have been easy, what you did.
Just a bit of deep breathing, that's all.
Nah, not that bit.
You forgave the unforgiveable.
Why'd you do it?
I was crazy with grief.
Jealousy.
I loved your father.
Too much.
I just drove straight at them.
And I could see your mother had gone into labour.
I grabbed her arm and I pulled...
I pulled her from the wreckage.
There was... so much blood.
And you were coming.
I could see that.
Weren't nothing going to stop you popping out right there, in the glass and... blood and metal.
I didn't have to do much.
I always thought it was my fault that she died.
This got nothing to do with you, boy.
I brought all this on.
I guess we're even, then.
Enough yapping.
We gotta get you out of them clothes.
(BOTH LAUGH)
Do you like it?
Don't I get to choose any of my own stuff?
Step outside, the alarm gets activated at CA.
Damage or break the security tag, same thing.
I'll make us some dinner.
You can have a shower, get some rest.
You're just another slaver.
What makes it worse is that you're a black slaver.
I'm more black than you'll ever be.
Your skin's the only thing about you that says black man.
We are going to get it back.
(WHISTLES)
Keep quiet.
You shut this down, then what?
I go back to being hunted on the streets.
