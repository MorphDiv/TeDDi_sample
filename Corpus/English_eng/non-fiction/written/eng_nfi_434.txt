Israeli ngo the apartheid israel and Nazi methods accuses a senior employee told the journalists tuvia tenenbaum the face that the holocaust is a lie and also an invention of the Jews was and what caught your task a tight when something neck hurt

I know was as done German peters a hobby of German should it with your guests' scientist to the side and I accompanied him and, current camera distance from it has been a holocaust the top staff of b cells and he
denies that the holocaust never there has to be one in so leaving researchers
Who pays these people why they
Israelite such idiots that they pay such organizations then I've researched the
Israeli government paid for the money comes from abroad partly it comes from German Jews guess what a huge part of the money comes from Germany and who are the
German financing the bread for the world's reputable
According to estimates, the eu transfer
European governments European churches and financed by the eu un Organizations annually 100 million euro tax monies to political offices of the predominantly operate anti-Israeli campaigns germany share it about 10 million euros annually as much the countless angeles in get Palestinian territories
no one knows exactly the sorrow that these organizations now taking as ngo leads campaigns have the underlying facts be questioned too often the hawks the embassy adjusted very often provide such legal requirements on basis which would like to see what they
not on the basis of what the general recognized set these requirements are by journalists or by journalists of diplomats and other recorded and to the fact and reality and so see the headlines from this ellis paramedic the cause of
Palestinian terror slips in messages are backwards
[Music] 2014 over white eu 307 million euro to the Palestinian autonomy authority the largest part comes from the German government, the in turn also further 143 providing millions of euro and thus a total of 210 million Euro expending
440 million dollars coming from the us on top many millions from the gulf states and other Muslim countries are not taken into account and it goes like this year for year no one gets worldwide more per head than 46 million Palestinians
the West Bank and Gaza on to lhasa a country highlighted on the globe gets to life so much attention at gasa bubbling the associations prison concentration camp water shortage infanticide, genocide associations the worldwide legions of activists journalists and politicians

It is our first visit else behind they sent back to us with the deeper down into the heart of golf gaza
much looks like in other
Islamic countries even some better the facts 74 years is the life expectancy of a Gaza resident higher than in Egypt Ukraine and
125 further states that child mortality is on the level turkey or lower than the 97 other states to 360 square kilometers 718 million people corresponding to an average of 5000 inhabitants per square kilometer in paris home to more than 21,000 people per

A number of media in Europe always use repeating the same clichés gaza was most densely populated in the global compare a stock a prison they to know even one guilty israel hamas end of 1980 he years of muslim brotherhood founded wants a

Western diplomats to members of the many when they come out and descend aid organizations
jerusalem needs of capital be Palestinian state
[Music] as a whole as a whole
hamas is considered corrupt functionaries to build villas with mosques on the beach where does the money one for high-level
Palestinian employees of
Christian aid organization world vision are suspected 45 million euros helpful monies to jammers to have diverted which might explain some magnificent
Palestinians from the approximately 10 million world are depending on the definition about seven millions as refugees since
1948, the number has increased tenfold the is unique about the half of the population in Gaza is below 25 we ask students before one of the four universities as financially get on we are told that it comes from
TV plugged European financial aid malta or usa but I have in allah never seen anything any stuffs the bags full and the proposed
something in which you probably many
Palestinians would disagree with which they do not agree but I think a two-state solution fair to both sides so so good for me from a part of the money long thin bags other people and you know not where and where it
really going
I get the need of the poor it really need or get there are other car therefore say that it the corruption is that can not be deny ask for it , we find studies
[Applause]
[Music] what I no rain
I think before we the foreign or people have accuse abroad we the looks shoulders find
We urgently need a fundamental renovation we need a hand ranges and can the fault is not in other countries give
I can not talk about that hamas a part of it is tricky because they part of the whole brain gaza is really a problem a big problem-just across the hamas to practice in to just about the contract talk or the she and all the
others here in gaza this really is a problem , the responsible government is the country have taken everything would lured nothing has for us gaza is a two class society as half the population has lived here for decades in provisorium with
refugee status there by hamas spent as well as the international community apparently so willed only Palestinians with the refugee status that is inherited the number of Palestinian displaced reaches the nearly 70 years they are not integrated world because she found around the house for Western
Grants to political demanding additional tutorials European financial assistance is well received and well abandoned but it is not so 100 percent to there are a few among transgressions European financial assistance is helpful and hunting comes to but it is not sufficient, secondly,
they arrive at the needy but it is clear that there are a few
Join here are the means implementation nimble to 100 percent perhaps 90 percent the best solution would be that I in my country return from which they me and my ancestors sold have and that the Jews in country their return is another solution
it not you know that gaza a very poor country and by grants from the
I live abroad will plead with them open reason
European countries are there the the existence of israel on the
Palestinian areas allow
Therefore, they have the task or the obligation to
Palestinian refugees with greater support money hum because the people's sense of European support not really
for nothing the means do not you remember responsible is all lies and all are equipped with all due respect thieves and we go empty-handed
the solution is there a state arises that the crossings open be that we finally see the world we live very poorly happen can the large above the play with us they play against each other this is the situation testify to this
we did not have long to get
Search without camera were told the west must all financial aid to gaza emphasize so the samas regime collapses and when it last for years would on the other hand, the pro palestine movement in europe as the fifth column-the
Hamas is responsible for Palestinians it almost 70 years own refugee's Fund, the rubbish all other refugees worldwide have with the content un hcr the uni-budget 2016 is 136 billion euro
[Music]
exist despite this immense sum not enough classroom this un organization is the second largest employer after
Palestinian autonomy authority employs nearly 30,000 people almost all of which are just a palestinian small part of the 136 billion-euro is also used in the population at we have in a refugee boat seen
thanks to Germany now one of the biggest spender for gaza again unpacks when I get out of the financial aid america europe the gulf states for the refugees think it is the most highest alimentierte refugee status of the world's my question
to them I have nothing of the money seen where is the money that's a big ask
Lower-setting were presented at the conference in october 2014 after the Gaza war billion dollars requested vienna as untrue they have in 124 dollar million requested
Unfortunately, we have not only third disposable get this manage the lack of on money building materials , the blockade illegal blockade on the access to Gaza pure and out causing a big problem for all the solution is very
complicated
My big question is over billions billions and decades long and now we sit here and I was just an area that looks like a damn piece of shit and I ask me who is corrupt who in this whole process is corrupt UNRWA
hamas who is the money of a nation do not ask for the population to it where the money ends up it can not be that the billions have arrived at the man
about our say have controller we have enough had and we are in constant contact with them with the by the way the biggest spender for the unrest billion come from the eu since 1990 as the official cooperation and partnership between
untrue begun to rethink had but I believe that all shut political solution there is no political in this case solution
we do not know where that is goes money the only organization of the United nations goes to a all their money from the donor countries get only organization of the United nations no supervisory board , the only organization of the united nations is
in the only local server left and 1988 as the rubbish in committee the refugee camps on the spot the administration of all donate funds transferred they have finally any control lost over the use of money there are quotas for medical
supply support services Human Services services and go to the local administrative latest of where they go that no one go
Why feel the over 1000 m big alone in Ramallah both here when a human rights organization according to Rabat would go and whether in a king mohammed the tenth university its insights on the Moroccan human rights violations in the world
would present driver would be the her last trip to Morocco should they did to Europe back in
Israel an open country and liberal there is disagreement contradictory and multiparty system well one too many parties democracy if you here come and criticized Israel not in a coffin sent home but with a medal that's easy to go to some games
ankara and they try there over the talk situation of the Kurds this will not end well ironically, is because of the liberal society resulting in a self-critical process is and the location is to reform itself this is one of the reasons why Israel
most from getting though the have least of what needs also always the reasons are the effect is an unprecedented and unique standards only for the Jewish state almost anti-Semitic means not that the motive of the people do this are anti-Semitic or that
anyone would deliberately bad about thinking young but the fact that exactly the state in which several of Jewish lives for
This special treatment of europeans was chosen is extremely remarkable bds fought worldwide in 2005 for economic and cultural academic world deducting investments and for sanctions against israel backer also comes from trade associations bond funds water suppliers Rooneys banks governments ensi from parties

now have Christian communities connected world from all on the way to paris to dedicated women this time comes bds is a very big subject how not with the
Israeli government an opinion be
I do not always agree
No lying to their policy and their setting are sometimes questionable but if then groups please majority per Palestine groups in france with cameras in the hyper machine, power that is a big
