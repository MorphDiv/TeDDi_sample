Man:

Man â™ª2:

Fx presents legion.
Good evening.
We are here tonight to talk about violence.
Or maybe human nature.
We are here to talk about human nature.
Wait.
A quote. the warlike man attacks himself.
This is the root of all our problems.

is ignorance.
Figure your shit out.
That's my... what I'd say.
There are two kinds of stories we tell our children.
The first kind:
there was a fuzzy little rabbit named frizzy-top fun adventure which he overcame through perseverance and by being adorable.
This kind of story teaches empathy. in other words.
The other kind: you'll be sucked into the sea and drowned!
This kind of story teaches them fear. these two stories compete.
Empathy and fear. a work in five acts about a fuzzy little bunny and what happened next.
Let us begin.
Syd:

But found only lies.
The doctor had disappeared.
The old girlfriend hid behind a smile.
What was real?
That was the mission.
heard things.
But could we believe our eyes?
Could David?
Woman:

Dr. pooley:

Woman:

Woman:

wake up.
Wake up.
Odd.
Extremely.
right? if that's what he is.
David:

Cassiopeia.
Syd:

Kissinger says I'm clean.
So I get to go home.
No!
wake up.
Cary:

No.
Too risky.
Agreed.
Syd:

where are you?
You've got to get better so you can come home too.
David.
Wake up.
his subconscious.
I looked.
I can't find it.
no.
His mind is active.
though?
Ptonomy:

An astral plane.
We have been inside David's memories three times.
omissions.
It's as if we've activated some kind of guardian.
There's something in David's memory he does not want us to see.
- Kerry.

Melanie:

the three of you.
I'm sending you out.
We need to find out exactly what happened to David before he went to clockworks.
Syd:

Melanie:

though?
'Cause I'm thinking "dangerous" is a better word.
I'm in.
Melanie:

Syd:

That was the mission.
Keep an eye out.
We can't stay long. but I'd say Dr. poole hasn't been here in a few years.
It's weird...
Seeing it after visiting David's memory.
The curtains are completely different.
Most people's memories are unreliable... that people say.
And they change over time too.
Your past is an illusion.
There was a tear right there.
The wall opened up and a red light came out.
And the boy ran into the closet.
And I followed.
Wait!
the invented space.
I looked for you.
You weren't in any memories of David I could find.
Are you saying David created that space?
Ptonomy:

Psychic projection to create a simulated reality.
Okay.
Let's see what she has to say.
Who?
Ptonomy:

There you are.
Objects have memory too.
Is there any way...
Could we still be in David's mind?
Ptonomy:

this is real.
How do you know?
'Cause I know.
I'm pretty sure.
How do you...
Put your hand here.
Watch it.
I won't touch you.

Just close your eyes.
Man:

Cassiopeia.
Bootes.
Canis major.
Lupus.
Telescopium.
what did the stars say?
Did he...
Looks like the doctor came back while David was robbing the place.
It doesn't sound like David.
but he's not stable.
Trust me. and then get dumped in a loony bin.
I was in a loony bin.
but you're... you're a card trick.
I read the report.
He broke the doctor's skull.
Had to put the guy in a coma to get the swelling down.
And that was with his fists.
Imagine if he used his power.
He's a bomb.
- What did the stars say?

"what did the stars say?
And I saw him just before the monster came.
like a flash.
audio tape.
And his hands were...
- Are you saying...

Omissions.
You've seen his memories.
gaps.
What if...
I've seen implanted memories before.
You can always tell.
Implanted from the outside.
I'm talking about...
David.
Maybe he's hidden his real memories behind fake ones.
Why?
I don't know.
Lot of effort just to convince yourself your boyfriend's a nice guy.
Conversation's on tape.
What did the stars say?
I know he's hiding things.
and we're out.
What if he didn't come in here to steal a radio or some coins?
Big score potential.
What if he came here to get rid of evidence?
the one time he said too much.
Syd:

Woman:

Syd:

Dorothy landed in oz.
Or did she?
I was looking for the man I loved.
Or did I just love the idea of him?
The face he showed me?
All I could do was follow the lines...
Man:

Syd:

The things he'd done.
The things he'd said.
Who are we if not the stories we tell ourselves?
Hello.
Who's that?
Kissinger:

I exist!
I'm in a cell!
We should speak quietly.
They might...

Who?
Tell me your name.
Amy... haller.
My god.
The sister.
Who are you?
My name is kissinger.

David's doctor.
I went to the hospital to look for you.
They said you didn't exist.
I do.
I used to.
Have they...
Did you tell them where he is?
No.
I don't know.
I haven't seen him since...
Did you?
No. but...
Did you know...
He wasn't sick?
That... that he had powers?
visions.
Did you?
I think so.
I should have.
hospitals.
he was so sweet.
But he... he moved.
sometimes further.
and you'd follow it.
He wouldn't be there.
conversations he couldn't have heard.
More than conversations...

I'd catch him talking to people who weren't there.
Who are you talking to?
king.
The dog.
Your dog.
David spoke of him often.
Amy:

We didn't have a dog.
you are gonna see things.
You will not feel the same about me.
Woman:
he found an address for Philly.
Syd.

found an address for the girlfriend.
Ex-girlfriend.
Mm-hmm.
So you live...
Inside his body.
We share.
Is that weird?
I'll tell you a story.
Ray and Irma whitecloud.
and it's a girl.
Native girl.
They decide to name her kerry.
a skinny white boy comes out.
Ray decides Irma had an affair.
so now Irma's a single mother raising this bastard runt.
little boy Cary wakes up in his room.
Kerry:

but...
Cary:

She lives inside of him...
Cary and kerry:

Two people in one body.
Syd:

What about you?
What do you mean? with feelings.
I'm...
Asking what it's like for you.
okay? whatever it is you guys do in the bathroom.
And I get all the action.
and I keep him safe.
If that's weird...
I'm okay with it.
Man:

Melanie:

Syd:

We'll get the facts.
Melanie:

Cary:

You sure?
It's not just coincidence with David gone.
Maybe he's waking up.
but don't get your hopes up.
We've been wrong before.
Do you miss her?
Kerry?
Is that dumb?
No.
It's sweet.
It still amazes me how she only ages when she's outside your body.
and here I am getting old.
I wonder?
Is he...
He's still here.
His body.
ah!
Oliver?
It's me.
Man:

Unannounced visitor.
Unannounced visitor.

Unannounced visitor.
Unannounced visitor.

Unannounced...
- What was it?

I told you we need to replace this operating system.
No.
He's trying to reach us.
my love.
Come back to us.
Man:

Unannounced visitor.
Unannounced visitor.

Unannounced visitor.
Unannounced...
Wait.
Drink?
Uh...
Sure.
What's real in this space is whatever you want it to be.
So my feeling is why not wait in style?
Wait for what?
Where are we?
Sorry about the cold.
It's the only thing I can't seem to fix in here.
would you like to listen to something?
Uh...
Torrent downloaded from RARBG
um... dig that groove.
it's genius.
Can you...
Can you turn it off?
Sorry.
um...
I had a similar...
Proclivity?
Malady.
I forget the word.

Drift.
Right.
And here is... I was...
Unless I'm not really awake.
Maybe this is the drug.
Tell me something.
Do they still...

Girls in summer dresses with no bra?
Y...

It's definitely...

Oh.
Too bad.
So... right.
there's good news and there's bad news.
The bad news is it's not the drug.
You're here in the astral plane.
You went too far into the make-believe consciousness. where you can imaginify yourself a kingdom but nothing is ever real.
And what's the good news?
I'm not alone anymore.
How do you feel about beat poetry? dreaming of your enumerations.
What peaches and what penumbras.
Whole families shopping at night. babies in the tomatoes.
sir?
please.
Don't worry.
He can't get you in here.
He"?
Your monster.
Ah.
He makes you forget.
Clever.
What are you... like a dog trying to chew off its own tail.
I've seen it before.
I thought.
But Melanie said it was because of my powers.
Melanie.
I knew a Melanie once.
You know what?
back to the...
They need me.

your sister.
- How do you...

It's waiting.
The monster. and now it's hunting you.
There is no monster.

I know that.

It's my psychology.
monster as metaphor.
I like it.

It's part of you;

But not like a symptom.
More like a...
Parasite.
What are you saying?

that's superstition.

I'm saying maybe it's good you're here.
Figure some things out.
Defeat the dragon. the dragon wins.
I can't just...

Syd and Amy.
So I am gonna get out of this place.
I am not waiting.
- How?

Pity.
Two more and we could have had a barbershop quartet.
Right. but things get muddy out there in the vast subconscious.
it's not real unless you make it real.
Come back any time.
Wednesday's karaoke night.
soldiers in a secret war.
the golem of myth.
make-believe.
Sometimes it felt like that to us too.
I was a woman who couldn't be touched...
In love with a man who wasn't there.
What was real?
that was the mission.
Ptonomy:

Scan her?
I'll look through her memories while you keep her busy.
I need 30 to 40 minutes.
How am I supposed to keep her busy for 30 to 40 minutes?
Buy a house.
just whistle.
right?
To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence.
Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
Whatever.
Oh...
And I'm blind.
Woman:

Kids.

wow.

no.
we're not having kids.
we're talking.
you don't get 'em just by talking. but we were thinking about something on the West Side.
Great.
You want to take a look at some places?
More coffee?
no.
I've got a hard enough time sleeping as it is.
Woman:

We don't have to...

He's right.
But I would like to hear more about this dog you guys are thinking of getting.
His name's Archie.
David had a beagle when he was a kid.
King.

everywhere.
Woman:

but...
Amy must have some.

A lot"?

You know...
Had a past.
Evidence he was ever...
You know...
Had a past.
So you want to take a tour?
thanks.
I think we've found what we're looking for.
I'm sorry.

Did you date someone named David?
Syd.
Are you friends of his?
Do you know where he is?
we... actually.
But I just wanted you to know he said such nice things about you.
Did he...
Did things end badly with you guys?
It's...
I thought I could fix him.
you know.
He was always nice to me.

Syd:

he was a...
I guess?
the one he did drugs with...
Unhand the reptile.
don't fight.
Was a man?
a big guy. but not with his eyes.
is there anything that you want to say?
A message?
Tell him...
They're watching.
Syd:

Ptonomy:

This would be an awesome place to have a fight.
but whoever altered.
David's memory replaced the real dude with Lenny. ninjas on fast ropes.
Why?
I don't know.
Let's ask the doctor.
Benny...
Which one was real?
Or were they one and the same?
A man who became a woman?
Or maybe it was just an illusion. we're here about David haller.
I don't talk about my patients.
Please.
He's in trouble.
He told us that he broke into your office to steal things so that he could buy drugs.
We think there's another story. and you'll never see us again.
I swept upstairs.

Same drill.
You talk.

it's...
We're not spies.
let's let him talk.
Thank you.
Of course.
So you're a lighthouse keeper now.
I'd like to think I was always a lighthouse keeper.
How long did you treat David?
Dr. poole:

Why off?
Dr. poole:

But when he went off it...
What about drugs or booze?
good and bad.
There was a friend.
A man or woman?
A man.
Benny. a negative effect on David's treatment.
David?
Before the break-in?

He doubled his sessions.
It was clear that there were things he wanted to say but couldn't until his last appointment.
Syd:

What did the stars say?
You're in love with him.
Yes.
I'd very much like to see David again.
Could you take me to him?
Why?
Because I have the same question you do.
kids.
Now I can't see out of one eye.
I can't concentrate.
He ruined my life.
I just want to ask him why.
So he's in charge.
Nobody's in charge.
We're here together.
And Melanie bird?
Is she not the leader of your little band?
Syd:

It's a trap.
- Shit.

talk.
My turn.
We've been looking for you.
That was a mistake.
Sir?
Target's acquired.
- The other?

It's a trick.
He's not...
Throw them in the vehicle.
I'll take them back myself.
Lenny:

dreaming you're a mountain climber?
it's your little room.
I am not in the mood.
Whoopsee.

Kid.
kid!
Are you my friend?
'Cause I could really use... of course I'm your friend.
Come on. your mean friend.
But don't worry;

Blow me.
bro.
But I could be talked into a circle jerk... if you can get it up in this place. looking for an exit like an idiot. mission complete.
I lost my mind.
kid.
okay?
what kind of a name is summerland?
man.
and now we're here.
he said it wasn't the drugs.
captain Nemo in his giant ice cube?
Man:
they doped you up and kicked you out of your own body to do who knows what. they could be fingering you right now.
really?
I'm you.
I'm me.
Please.
The truth.
pal.
okay? there I am.
And I can't hang out in this shit-stain no-place okay?
I got things to do.
What does that mean?
So I was thinking. maybe we...
Hey.
Or maybe you need a little more motivation.
is that...

- No.

- No.

no.

Lenny:

Come on!
Syd!
Syd!
Syd.
It's okay.

It's okay.
We were looking for you.
I know.

hold this.

Oh!
Run.
I'll protect you.

Grab her!
No!
David!
Run!
it's me!
David.
Woman:

Don't touch me!
