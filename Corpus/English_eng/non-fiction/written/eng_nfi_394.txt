*ATTACK ON TITAN (DUBBED)* Season 02 Episode 08 Sync corrections - by srjanapala
Title: "The Hunters"
Ugh.
You'll catch your death sleeping out here.
Tell me you didn't drink all this yourself.
Keep tossing it back like someone half your age,
I'll end up putting you in diapers.
Doesn't sound so bad to me.
Old men like to be doted on.
What's the situation?
Well, several patrol units were sent out.
Not many Titans between the first and second defensive lines.
And the few that did crop up seemed like they were pretty far apart.
Hmm.
If Hannes and the advance squad have managed to follow the wall without incident, they should be getting back before too long.
Fairly straightforward operation.
They'd have run into the unit from Krolva about halfway and turned around for home.
It's a safe assumption they encountered few Titans, if any.
If Wall Rose had been breached, sightings wouldn't be so random.
Commander Pyxis.
Hm?
Ah, Commander Erwin.
Is it true what I hear about you catching a troublesome little mouse?
Well... technically, yes.
Not that it's helped us.
Might even be forced to reconsider their belief system.
Morally bankrupt as it is.
Look over there.
Military Police putting in an appearance where Titans aren't just an academic problem.
You really sayin' there weren't any?
I know, right?
It's unusually quiet out there.
Wonder if they're still alive.
Problem?
You seem eager to be eaten alive, solider.
Lots of scouting expeditions.
I'd be more than happy for the help.
We could all fight Titans together.
Well, you know.
There's our work in the interior, so...
That's correct, sir!
You see, we ran into another group on the way back to Trost.
It was the Scout unit led by Section Commander Hange.
There were recruits from the 104th Cadet Corps with them, none of whom had equipment.
This may sound crazy, sir, but three of them were Titans!
Actually, I, um...
Jean, calm down.
What happened when their Titan forms were revealed?
The Scouts engaged the Armored Titan and the Colossal in battle as best they could, sir!
But by the time our unit arrived on the scene it was... too late.
I'm sorry.
Count your lucky stars we were all the way up here.
Rest of 'em got blasted by steam and debris;
nothing much they could do.
How badly is Mikasa hurt?
Well there aren't any wounds to speak of.
I think it's just a concussion.
Could be worse.
Armin, I've got food if you're hungry.
You eaten?
Be right back.
Mikasa!
What kind of trouble?
It's those three bullies again.
They took the bread I just bought.
I didn't want him to go!
Wait!
Give it back.
You have dirt in your ears or somethin'?
Like I said, I already ate the whole thing.
Tasty.
But that was three days worth of food for them!
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Those table scraps?
Whatever, you want it back so damn much...
Pay him back what the bread was worth!
Get off your drunk asses!
Let 'em work it out.
They're demolishing my stall!
This, uh, ain't our thing.
Best wait for someone more qualified to come along and sort it out.
Huh?
Eren!
Eat this, punk!
Mikasa...!
Eren, you need to go home and chop wood.
You want your mom to get angry?
You asked for it...!
Let go!
Don't let her do all the work!
What was that for?
Don't cheer the little bastards on!
Damn freeloaders!
Hey, if the shoe fits, shove it up your ass!
You son of a...!
I mean...
For a chump who runs a stall!
Come on, man!
Don't get beat by a soldier!
Stop it right now!
What the hell is wrong with you?
Act like adults!
Give it back!
Damn it!
That's enough!
This is gettin' kinda serious.
Get back here!
I don't care about the stupid bread!
Let it go!
No you don't!
Eren!
Mikasa.
We don't know how badly you're hurt!
Where is he?
Eren and Ymir were taken.
He fought, but the Armored Titan was just too...
That was about five hours ago.
Somebody's gone after them, right?
Tell me somebody went after them.
We wanted to, but the horses are on the other side of the wall.
Our only option is to wait.
The mounts can't be hauled over until the lifts make it here and that takes time.
There's nothing else we can do right now.
Section Commander Hange and the other officers are too injured to move.
We don't have enough soldiers to form a scouting party.
Even a small one would need more than this.
We're not experienced enough.
You understand?
You feel any pain?
Don't worry about it.
It's just... not the first time I've been down this road.
Except when Annie took him,
That's how Captain Levi and I were able to get him back.
But... it's already been five hours.
Hey, Armin.
Always end up someplace we're not?
Yeah, it does seem to happen a lot.
Ever since we were kids Eren liked to run off on his own.
Leave us worried sick.
I don't want much.
Just to be near him.
That's all.
Heads up, Armin.
Sorry it's only field rations, but better than nothing, I guess.
Nothing new there.
Aaah.
Speaking of which, this feels familiar, huh?
You two've been runnin' damage control for that little hothead since the good ol' days, if I recall correctly.
Doesn't seem very fair, but what do I know?
Different time, different place, same problem.
Not exactly what I'd call a healthy relationship.
Am I wrong?
The neighborhood bullies weren't quite so tall, but I suppose there are similarities.
Can't hold his own for shit, but always lookin' for a fight.
Five guys wanna take him on, he'd wouldn't think twice about jumping into the fray like an idiot.
By the time Mikasa gets there or the MPs show up, he's beaten all to hell.
But you know...
I may not've ever had the privilege of seeing Eren win, but I never saw the little son of a bitch back down either.
Kid's got fire.
To tell the truth, his persistence scares the piss outta me sometimes.
He gets knocked on his ass, he gets right back up again.
It's in his blood.
You think he'd let himself be snatched away without fighting tooth and nail?
Not a chance.
Whatever strength he's got left, he'll use it.
What's two guys next to a whole gang?
If you can count on anything, it's that Eren'll give 'em hell.
At least till you or me shows up to help.
That's how it's always been, right?
'Course if you ask Eren, he'd tell ya they were an illusion.
Just us kidding ourselves.
But I for one was never happier than when folks thought of me as a freeloading waste of space.
But I'm willing to fight for it.
He needs us.
Whaddya say we stick to what we know.
It ain't the good ol' days 'less the three of you are together.
They're here.
Is that?
Oh, wow.
Ah!
Commander Erwin!
With MPs!
Never thought they'd ride on top of the wall.
Probably the quickest route here.
For the record, I know you won't, but I'd much prefer it if you stayed behind.
As long as Ymir's in danger, nothing will keep me here.
We're all in this together, Armin.
You're not special.
Every one of us has a reason for going.
Still trying to process mine, to be honest.
I have to know why Bertholdt and Reiner did what they did.
I wanna ask while I look them dead in the eye.
Good to see you, Commander Erwin.
Glad you're here.
Is the situation still the same?
Hange?
See, even if they had a way to cover the Armored Titan's footprints, this... is almost definitely where we would find them.
Why's that?
They need to recoup.
They have the power to assume Titan form, but other Titans on that side of the wall still pose a threat.
Especially after putting up such a fight.
Yes, Eren was the worse for it, but they've got to be spent.
Remember when Annie went out cold?
Let's suppose they're headed somewhere beyond Wall Maria.
That's not a simple hike.
They'll need all the rest they can get before covering that kind of distance.
They're in no shape to make it in a single push.
And if so, they'll want to catch their breath somewhere other Titans can't get to them.
Odds are they'll hold out till it gets dark.
You're awake.
Welcome back.
We have until sundown!
If we can reach the forest by then, we might just have a chance to save them!
Let's move!
