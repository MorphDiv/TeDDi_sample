Previously on 24...
I think Amira's gonna do something.
He thinks you're planning an attack at the school with someone.

I told him I've explained everything to you and you believed it.
Did drew believe it?
I knew you were lying to me.
He was the one you were texting?

I was beginning to think this was gonna happen without you.
The party asked John to run four years ago.
Heknew I couldn't track bin-Khalid andworkon hiscampaign at the same time.
Standing up for the truth the way you did... it's what I've been telling the American people I'm gonna do for them.
You'll still take a hit.
Well, the hit I can take.
It's the not swinging back...

There's a hit on whoever accessed the army rangers' identities.
The computer that belongs to nilaa mizrani.
My husband's campaign manager.
Isaac, we can't let him do this.
I want to talk to him.
To try to change his mind?

He gonna do what he gonna do.

You are unbelievable.

Like that would stop you starting up with her again.
Don't get crazy.
Money ain't coming in like it was.
That's why I reached out to you in the first place, put this deal together.
If Isaac doesn't make it back from this meeting, wouldn'tbealot oftears.
Bin-Khalid's people...

Theykilled the rest of the squad.
Therewasaflashdrive containinga list of sleeper cells, along with all the codes to trigger their attacks.
Are you saying grimes still has it?

Two million dollars.
Showupat the7th street Metro station in one hour.
You got to give me more time!
You get me the money, or I call bin-Khalid's men.
I took one of their phones.
Just tell me if the money's at the police station, Rebecca.
Your source is right.
Metro pd made a drug bust in southeast D.C.
Recovered a little over $4.6 million in cash.
Just need to know where the evidence lockers are.
This is crazy.

Okay, feeding in the loops.
Go.
We were pulled off-line.

Keith, we're running an operation.

You're not running anything!

Rebecca, can you hear me?

Can anyone hear me?

Rebecca respects you.
It's not about not trusting you.
She had no choice.
Once she confirmed you weren't the breach, she was relieved.
Can I get some water?
It-it is so hot in here.

Oh, god.
His story syncs up with Rebecca's.
They could be covering for each other.
According to his autonomic indicators, he's telling the truth.
Perp managed to get his hands on a gun.
He took Vernon and bates hostage before they could process him.
Who is he?
Name's Eric Carter.
Mr. Carter!
This is commander George Marx.

I hear you fine.
But if you want your men alive, you stay out!
Nobody's doing anything.
Let's just keep talking, okay?
Tell me what you want.

Mr. Carter?
What's on the other side of this wall?
It's only a matter of time before they come busting through that door.
Shut up.
Listen, whatever you think you know about me, you don't.
My name is Eric Carter.

The guy that was on that phone... he has a list of sleeper cells that are waiting to be activated.
If I don't get this money to him, he's gonna sell that list to the terrorists, and there will be attacks all over this country.
Do you understand me?

Yeah, right.
Please.
Please.
I need your help.
Why don't you open that door, explain it to the captain?
I swear to you, there is no time for that.
Behind that wall...
Damn it, bates!
...there's a stairwell.

Yeah.

They're on their way over here now.
I went deeper into Carter's file.
Guy enlisted in the army.
Did tours in Afghanistan and Yemen, worked his way up to special forces.
Special forces?
Yep.
Get me out of here.

Bates.
Bates!

Get through that door now!
He's getting away!
Come on, this way.
Bates!

Go, go, go!
Carter's gone.

Room clear!

This way.

Dispatch, this is lieutenant Daniels.
I'm ordering an emergency lockdown.
An armed suspect, six-two,
African-American, has escaped custody.
He is ex-military, and he is holding an officer hostage.
Out this way!
Is there another way out?
That terrorist thing...

Yes.

Listen, if i don't get out of here, a lot of people are gonna die.
There's another exit on the roof.
Move.
Move, move, move.
It's down this way.

Visual of suspect!
Come here!

Lower your weapons!
Lower your weapons!

Lower your weapons!

Lower your weapon!

Let the man go!
I will kill him!
- Carter!

This ends now!

I have a shot.
I have to get out of here!

Stand down.
Stand down.
Lower your weapons.
I have Rebecca ingram from CTU.
She's explained everything.
She's on the line for you.
Rebecca?
Thank god.

You tell me.
I'm here with director mullins at CTU.
We cleared him.

Areyousure?
Yes, I am.
Now, he's up to speed on everything.
He knows you need to get grimes the money as soon as possible, so I'm gonna put him on.
Carter, the police are giving you a vehicle and a comm package.
A CTU tac team will follow you to your rendezvous with grimes.
But they won't make any moves until they confirm grimes has the list of sleepers.
No.

He spots anyone he even thinks might be with the government, he will bolt.
I'll make sure the tac team stays hidden.
You'renothearingme.
Ben is counter-surveillance trained, okay?
He's also very paranoid.
Carter, grimes has already gotten away from you once.
We can't let that happen again.
Eric, you and I were operating alone because we didn't know who we could trust.
Now we do.

All right, Carter, are we clear?
Yeah.

Let's get you down to motor pool.

Come on, let's go.
Mullins is about to brief everyone, and last I looked, you're still on shift.
Thanks.
I need to apologize for everything that happened.
We'll adjudicate this another time.
Okay.

Look, I have to ask.
Nilaa mizrani... we know she's a leak.
I want to be the one to bring her in.
I keep having to remind you, you don't work here anymore.
She's my husband's campaign manager.
Keith, it would be easier for John if I do this.
Take agent fox with you.
Thank you.

According to Carter, the list of sleepers is on a USB flash drive.
We can't move in until we confirm grimes has it.
Give me a second.
Andy.
I'm sorry I've been shutting you out.
Look, I'm not happy about the way things ended.
Things didn't just end.
You ended them.
I need everyone to close the projects you're working on and listen up.
We've just received reliable intel that sleeper cells are preparing to launch multiple terror attacks.
We don't know where or when.
Casualties could be extremely high.
This is a high-value threat assessment.
We don't have a lot of time.
Stay focused.
This operation just became priority number one.
So, Jerome's staying here to look after Nicole, all right?
Since when you need my permission?
Aisha, look, this business ain't never been easy, all right?
But it's never been this hard, neither.
If I've been taking it out on you, I'm sorry.
Whatever.
Come on.
Don't be like that, a'ight?
Take us a half hour, at least, to get cross town to royo, bro.
Isaac.
I...
What?
It's nothing.

A'ight.
What you looking at?
So, she wasn't there to pray.
She-she went there to talk down some crackpot imam, call him out.
Well, even if that's true, do you trust the voters to make that distinction?
I do.
Well, John, you're an optimist, and that's your great gift, but I'm telling you that a lot of these folks...

I don't think so, dad.

Oh, let me take this;

Ask her what she thinks.
I will.
Everyone's been asking after you, darling.
I'm actually heading over there now.
Well, good.
John, you need to know...

It's serious.
What's going on?
Secret service is sequestering nilaa.
They'll be discreet, but i wanted to give you the heads-up.
Wait, wait, wh-what do you mean, sequestering her?
I'll explain when I see you.

Rebecca...

Please.
Eric?
Nicole.
Oh, my god.
Thank god you're all right.
I'm sorry I haven't called you before now.
It's okay, as long as you're safe.
Howareyou?
I'm fine.

Listen, this whole thing with Ben is winding down, and we cleared the guy running CTU.
Does that mean we can go home?
Soon.
I'm-a come get you, and...
We can start to put this whole thing behind us.

Listen, Nicole i know I haven't been hearing you.
AndI knowIgot alotof things that I need to work on.
But I promise you,
I promise you things are gonna be different.

I love you.
I love you, too.
I'llcallyoulater.
Wait, Eric.
Yeah?
Isaac's girlfriend, or whatever she is, she's up to something.
Like what?
I don't know.

It's just a feeling I have fromhowshe'sbeenacting.
And from a phone call she made she didn't want me to hear.
I don't know, maybe it's nothing, but, um, you know, I'm worried about Isaac.
No, Isaac can take care ofhisself.
He is looking out for me.
Okay, listen, if...

CTU might be able to pull up a transcript or some kind of recording, okay?
They can do that?
They can do a lot of stuff i didn't know they could.
Just make sure you tap into all those surveillance cameras, okay?
Torrent downloaded by rarbg
it's good to see you again, Carter.
I need a favor.
Phone call I need pulled for my wife.
Those are the details.

This is agent Locke.
He's the best tactical specialist in CTU.
He'll be leading the field team.
Now, we have no way of knowing how grimes will approach you at the station.
We'll keep the bulk of the tac team out of your line of sight.
Agent Locke will shadow you.
As long as he stays invisible.
Grimes won't see me.
We've just hot mic'd your phone.
We'll be able to hear everything that's going on, and we will not make any moves till we confirm that grimes has the list with him.
Yeah, I'm due at the station.
Good luck.
Locke.
Look, I don't know what your orders are, but, um,
I don't want Ben coming out of this in a body bag.
That's up to him.
I'm just after the list.
Well, so am I.
But Ben and I served together.

No matter what he's done.
You asked me to remotely erase the memory.
I ran a locate on Malik and rashid's phones.
Also their guys, huh?
Five of the phones are here, stationary, in police custody.
We lost six men, not five.
The sixth one is in motion.
Someone else has it.
It's either grimes or Carter.
Whoever has that phone, I'll get him myself, so there will be no more mistakes.
We wait until it's dark before we move him.
This is bad.
We've stayed hidden for two years, Amira.
And we stay that way as long as we have to, I promise.
How's the teacher holding up?
He's fine.
'Cause killing someone for the first time, it...
It's no small thing.
Andwecan'tdothis without him.
Youunderstand,Amira?
You don't sound so sure.
Your brother was asking about me, wasn't he?
Yes.
And what did you say?
I told him you're with us.
So don't make me a liar.
No, I absolutely agree with that, but...
Why don't you grab a bite to eat first.
I'll catch up with you outside.
Hmm?

Okay, so tell me, what the hell is going on?
John... this is the last thing i want to be telling you.
The last thing you need to hear.
Someone used my proprietary code to get into the CTU system.
They accessed the file identifying the rangers who took out bin-Khalid.
And now most of them are dead.
We ran a trace.
The file was accessed from nilaa's computer.
I don't... why would she do that?
I'm not sure yet.
But the upshot is she may be facilitating a terrorist attack on domestic soil.
John.
Gage's campaign came up with some evidence linking nilaa to a radical mosque.
I confronted her about it, and she... she said she was there to protest, and i-i believed her.
I understand.

She volunteered for my first Senate Race.
You know, she went from working the phone banks to running my campaign.
I'm sorry, John.
Excuse me, ma'am.
We're ready.
She's in here.
I had them set up video and audio before they sequestered her.
Your guests are expecting you outside.
You should get back to them.
No.

Okay.
Do you know why i asked to talk to you?
I'm waiting for you to tell me.
Take a seat.
I'd rather stand.
Over the last few hours, terrorists killed four of the rangers who took out bin-Khalid.
This is a copy of my server log.
The highlighted subroutine contains the wit-sec information on those rangers.
It was accessed 25 days ago at 6:05 A.M. from your I.P. Address.
Nilaa, we've known each other a long time.
I don't want this to be you, so help me understand.
Who are you working with?
First Gage tries linking me to some radical mosque, and now you're calling me a terrorist?
Well, it wasn't me.
You need to do better than that.
I wasn't at campaign headquarters then.
I take a run every morning at 6:00, right after I pray.
I never miss either one when I'm in D.C.
Show me your route.
We'll see if we can confirm it.
Mr. Harris?
You said I could come by to go over my test.
She'll go away.
Not if she heard the faucet.
Mr. Harris?
Hold on, I'm-I'm coming.
Wait!
Hey, grace, uh, sorry, i-i completely spaced.
I'm working with another, uh, student right now.
So maybe we can do this tomorrow.
Are you all right, Mr. Harris?
Your hand.
Oh, I'm not, um... i-i dropped a beaker.
I-i must've cut myself cleaning it up.
It's nothing.
So, I'll see you tomorrow.
She could tell that I was lying to her.
I don't think so.

No, we need to wait until it's dark.
He... hel...
Quick, before someone sees him.
My god.
What happened?
We don't know.
We just saw him lying here.

Help!

Something's going on over here.
Get on the phone, call 911.
...Until my dad sits me down after the game, and-and he says, uh, "son,
"stopping at third base is no better than striking out.
"If you want to make a difference, you got to bring it home."
With your support in November, we'll be...
Keep checking traffic cams, surveillance from local businesses, anything that could prove nilaa was out running when she said she was.
Okay.
Henry.
So, you just slip in after the party's already started, and then disappear behind closed doors without so much as a "hello"?
Hello.

I'm sorry.

Just tell me what the hell's going on.
There was a situation at CTU.
And this, um, situation, did it have something to do with my son's campaign manager?
Henry, you know i can't talk about this.
I just found out she's under lockdown.
Do you honestly think i don't know what's going on in my own house?
Now, Rebecca, whatever is going on, if it affects John's campaign, you need to bring me up to speed.
Carter's two minutes out.

Mullins asked me to pull up a cell phone conversation for Eric Carter's wife.
But I can't find it.
That's because NSA hasn't captured it yet from the phone company servers.
But, look, if we go into the system directly and I.D. The cell tower that handled the call...
See?
So, um, what's going on with you and Locke?
He broke it off.
Thought if it got out, it'd screw up his career.
Geez, what year is he living in?
But, you know, behind closed doors, when promotions are being handed out, it-it matters.
That's what tom thinks, anyway.
There it is.
You can send it as soon as it decompresses.
Thanks.
Be right back.
Royo, it's me, Aisha.
What's up?
I don't like the way she been looking at me.
Maybe she knows something.
You want me to do her right now?
No.
Not until royo calls and we know Isaac's taken care of.
I know you ain't down with the split, neverhavebeen;

You?

IfIsaacdoesn'tmakeitback from this meeting, wouldn'tbealot oftears.
Something wrong?
No.

To who?
You're supposed to be laying low.
Why don't you give me that.
You serious?
Something wrong?
No.
Carter's entering the station now.
Yeah.
Ben, I'm here.
Where are you?
Platform number two.
Stayontheline.
We have facial rec looking for grimes on traffic and security cams.
So far no match.
Excuse me.

Ben.
Whatnow,man?
Get on the train.
Go, go.

All right, man, listen, I'm here.
I'm on the train.

Where are you?
Right here.
But you're staying right there.
Ben, I got your money.
Just give me the list and we're done.
I've got eyes on grimes.
Any sign of the list?

Ben, we had a deal.
Ben, the list.
I'm taking you to it.
Right now, you stay right where you are.
All right, let's go.
They said he's stable.
Okay, that's it.

The second he wakes up, he'll tell them about us, everything.
And what do you think my brother would say about that?
W-we don't have a choice.
Yes, we do.
I go to the hospital, and i can try to finish this.
Go back and finish the compound.

Excuse me, excuse me.

I'd like to travel with him to the hospital.
Climb in.

There were no cameras along your route.
No way to confirm you were out running when you said you were.
But I was.
I had the CTU search for any cameras near the campaign headquarters.
There's a bank in the building.
The atm camera picked up a reflection from the lobby window.
You said you were out running that morning.
But here you are, entering the office moments before your computer was used to access the rangers' new identities.
You lied, nilaa.
No.
No, that's not me.

Tell me who you're working with, and I will do my best to take the death penalty off the table, because that is what the a.G. Will be asking for.
I'm telling the truth!

That's not me!
That's not me.
Very nice.

I so appreciate you coming.
Thank you.

Here we go.
Talk to me.
My guy was able to hack the atm camera, change the time stamp.
Rebecca's already pulled the footage, and she has a record that nilaa was at campaign headquarters when her file was breached.
And there are no other cameras?
There's no way that CTU can confirm nilaa's story?
I went over the route myself, twice.
CTU won't be able to trace the leak back to you.
That's what you said the first time.
Henry, you asked me to handle your mess.
I'm handling it.
Giving up those soldiers was bad enough.
Now nilaa.
It's our only play.
Unless you're ready to burn down John's campaign and everything that you spent your life trying to build.
Target's moving towards Carter.
Copy that.
You wearing a wire?
I'm not wired, man.
He's not with me.
I came alone, man.
Just like you asked me to.
Sit.
I didn't want it to go like this, but I didn't have a choice.
You did have a choice.
You could've turned the list in with me and walked away.
No, no.
That's what this is all about.
It's about trying to get away from them, for good.
What do you think i got the money for?
Eric i got a plan.
Listen, a guy...

They got these lakes made by glaciers.
They're deep and ice-cold.
It's like a shock to your system.
Did you ever swim in glacier water?
No.
I always thought I could settle down in a place like this.
Looks like a nice place, Ben.
Then you should come.

You should bring Nicole.

There are no fresh starts, man.
You still got to deal with yourself.
No matter where you go.
I didn't mean to drag you into this.
But I just, I knew i couldn't do it on my own.
"Never shall I fail my comrades."
You remember those words?
Get ready.

We're almost there.
This might be it.
Copy that.
Step back.
Doorsclosing.
Stepback.
Doorsclosing.
They're heading to the mezzanine.
Copy that.
Linking you into the station's camera network.
Uploading station schematics now.
Turn in, right here, right here.
No good cover on the mezzanine.
We need to deploy outside the station.
Entry points here and here.
All right, give me the money.
Where's the list?
You heard me, Eric.
No angle here.

That's my bet.
Willconfirmas soonas I have eyes on.
I have four potential hostiles.
Ineedto warnCarter.
Go!
Let's go, boys.

He's got a gun!
Carter!
You lied to me!
Check on them, make sure they're okay.

You okay?

Down the stairs.
I'm fine.

Carter, where are you?
The hostiles have the list.

Carter, we didn't catch that.

They just entered the exit stairwell.
Confirm you're getting this!
Get out of the street!
Talk to me.
The terrorists, they...
