Previously on "Major Crimes"...
An hour ago, a bomb went off in East L.A.
I am a friend of Albert Luna's.
This could be connected to his ex-wife.
Liseth Ortiz.
He blamed her for everything that happened.
Cristian murdered Liseth's father so that she would come to his funeral.
When is the service?
Shit.

Control, Air 10, we've got a confirmed explosion, Rosedale Cemetery.
Confirmed explosion.
I'm gonna need additional units.

Just send everybody at this point.
This... this looks bad.
Units responding to the bombing are needed on the east side of Normandie Avenue.
South 17 responding.
- South 21 en route.

I'm looking for casualties.
Air 10, as per LAFD, please advise on a preliminary casualty assessment.
You okay?

- Yeah.

I'm not seeing any casualties.
There's no one at the gravesite.
Otherwise, this would've been a lot worse.
Roger that.
There's your C-4, Lieutenant.
We believe this large flower vase set beside your father's grave was the housing for the bomb.
And your ex-husband placed it at the cemetery.
He needed line of sight to see that we'd found the bomb.
That's why he blew it.
What... what you're saying just isn't possible.
Nothing else makes sense.

It was definitely your ex-husband, ma'am.

How does that make sense?

It does if Cristian was willing to kill a lot of people to get at you.
But he didn't even know I was here.
My God.

Commander Mason, any news?
My team traced Ortiz through prison and the military.
No terrorist connections at all.

- That's not news.

My God.

Wait.

I wasn't even here when Cristian was released from prison.
But he knew exactly how to bring you back.
That bastard murdered our father so he could get Liseth to come to the funeral?
Is that what you guys are saying?

Could either of you think why he'd be so determined to kill you, Liseth?
Has he threatened you?

Is there anything in particular...
How about he's a lunatic?
Not only has he murdered our father, but he...
He also stabbed my, um...
He stabbed Joseph Euley to death, the man with whom you were having an affair 12 years ago.
Yeah.

Do you even know where he is?

Perhaps you could help us answer that question, please.
Did your ex-husband have any particular place he liked to go?
I don't know.

But wait a minute.

It's not her job.
That's what we're trying to do here.
But maybe you could help us by giving us a list of Cristian's old friends or people he held grudges against or people he hated.
Chief.

After the cemetery bombing yesterday,
Chief Pope called me back and sent Winnie Davis in my place.
Are we to read anything into that?
What about the friends?
Maybe you won't be directing traffic in San Pedro after all.
I'd like to catch up with this investigation as soon as possible, Lieutenant.
Commander, if you're done here, could I have a word, please?
You need me, Lieutenant, you know where to find me.
He had friends.

I never even met any of them more than once.

Mother.

Captain, Chief Howard is here and asking to be briefed.
Our bombing suspect, Cristian Ortiz, got a deal for murdering his wife's boyfriend.
11 years for manslaughter because his lawyer claimed self-defense.
It didn't seem likely because the victim was stabbed 16 times, and Ortiz obviously brought the knife with him.
But a jury may have sympathized with a Marine whose wife was cheating on him.
According to his cellmate, Lewis Wilks,
Ortiz claimed his innocence until the day of his release.
Yes, Wilks also said that Ortiz blamed his wife for everything that happened.
- Ex-wife, sir.

And Ortiz left a bomb behind in her father's house.
- Maybe to blow her up.

Why leave a bomb behind to kill your wife, and then do stuff to it that means we have to collect it as evidence?
That, Chief, is the question that's troubling all of us.
I'm more bothered by all this missing C-4.
Let's go back to this manslaughter charge for a moment.
Was Ortiz definitively guilty?
He took a plea bargain.
We had a voice mail where he threatened Euley.
And his connection to the murder weapon was irrefutable... a Marine-issue KA-BAR knife covered with his prints and DNA and Mr. Euley's blood residue on the blade.
Julio, ask Dr. Morales to put together the autopsy report from Mr. Euley's death.
Okay, I don't know how to explain the radio, but Ortiz could've wrapped something around the hilt of the knife, like a plastic bag.
If he was being that careful, why not wipe the blade after?
And the hilt.

All right, don't forget Lewis Wilks, Ortiz's cellmate, indicated to us that he had more to tell us.
But he won't talk without a deal.
Wilks has six years left on a drug sentence.
And those six years aren't going away without information necessary to find and convict Ortiz...
I'm not worried about a conviction, Andrea.
There are pounds, pounds of C-4 unaccounted for.
He's obviously willing to use it.
I want this guy in custody.
We may have the conviction part locked up.
I found a partial print on the interior of the ceramic vase that housed our cemetery bomb.
Does the partial belong to Ortiz?
- Let's take a look.

But Wilks' information has to be good!
We will make sure he knows that!
Mom?
She talks tough, but she's already drawn up the paperwork reducing the guy's sentence by three years.
Just so you know.
Hey, Provenza.
I've been doing some thinking.
- Are you in pain?

N-no, I figure since my health has been pretty much on track...
I'm eating better, I'm exercising, vitamins...
So how long before I...

Flynn, you have had two big health scares in a row.
Now, getting you off of desk duty creates huge liability issues here.
And returning to the field?
Well...
You need the right person to be promoted to Assistant Chief.
Match found.
He's in the system, but he's not Cristian Ortiz.
Buzz?
Partial on the vase belongs to Franklin Dwayne Pearl, arrested in 2009 for armed robbery, released on parole six months ago.
Looks like he hasn't got in any trouble since.
He's made every parole hearing.
Well, it's what he's been doing between parole hearings that we're worried about, Nolan.
Where is Mr. Pearl right now?
Looks like he lives... here.
And works at Second Shot Thrift, right around the corner from his apartment.
Let's see if this guy's at work and then see what he has been working on.
I'm not going anywhere.
And despite Napa being,
- the best job I can get right now.

I can't believe I'm saying this.

Napa's great, and I totally get what it means to you.
But what about us?
Well, this is not a "What about us?" thing.
Because "us" could be living in Napa.
"Us" could be living in Oakland.
This is an "all about you wanting to stay here" thing.
Okay, no, I-I looked into transferring to Berkeley, okay?
I-I have the grades.
But I'm on track to graduate from UCLA next December, okay?
Berkeley does semesters instead of quarters.
That would add an extra six months to my...
Yeah, and Napa would add an extra $15,000 to my paycheck.
- But that's not what matters.

- Can you just hold on for...

I already said that I'm not going.
But let's both be clear that we are staying here in L.A.
You are not applying to law schools in other cities.
And if you don't get into one around here, that's it.
And meanwhile, I'll just keep working my stupid, not very important restaurant job, because this is where we live.
Gus, Gus,

I don't think that your job is stupid.
In fact, it's... it's such a big promotion that.
I-I was just surprised that your boss gave it to you.
Just because it's so incredibly important.
Yeah, it's just not as important as the things that you wanna do.
I mean, how could being a sous-chef compete with being a lawyer or... or a journalist or anything else Rusty Beck decides to do with his life?
I'm covering for someone during prep tomorrow.
I gotta be at work early.
You can come by around 9:00 and pick me up.
I'm just...

Remember, don't unnerve the guy.
Just shop until you find him.
Holy crap.

The radio used to house the bomb we found in Albert Luna's house.
We're in the right place.
I see him.
My God.
Excuse me.
Sir, can you tell me how much this is?
- Sure.

- Right.

What the hell?
Got him.

- What the hell, man?

Who?

I don't know any Cristian whatever his name is.
You are in enough trouble already!
We know you are connected to Ortiz.
- Tell where he is right now...

Or you're going back to prison today until we can charge you for murder!
We know Ortiz was in this store.
He had merchandise you sold him.
No, no, no, man.

Your fingerprints were found on a vase, just like this one that Ortiz used to blow up a cemetery!
Whoa!

You're saying you never saw this guy?

I don't know.

Maybe the dude came in here some.
But if he did, he had a beard.
See, now you remember.
- Amazing.

If it's the same dude, he was in here a couple of weeks ago.
- He bought a boatload of stuff.

Like that.
Cristian Ortiz purchased items like these at a thrift store in North Hollywood.
- Why?

Depends on what?
That depends on what you're willing to offer Mr. Wilks in return for his information.
Your client has six years left on his sentence.
We're willing to cut that to three, if what he tells us is actually worth anything.
What?

No, are... are you kidding me?

I'm sorry, guys.

Mr. Wilks' help could save maybe hundreds of lives here.
Or we could end up catching Ortiz on the street, and we see Wilks sometime next decade.
Six years or three.

Take it or regret it.
Son of a bitch.

May I?
You... you see all these hollow parts?
They're called voids.

Empty spaces where something can be hidden.
Everything here has a void.
I would use these items...
To hide drugs.
Ortiz...
He's using them for explosives.
So everything he bought has the potential to become a bomb.
- Housed in ordinary items...

That wouldn't be checked for explosives.
And if Ortiz bought as much as the guy at the thrift store said...
He could have dozens of bombs.
But where are they?

Right.

And then the others are for what?
Don't worry.
Ortiz said his ex-wife framed him.
She killed Euley, not him.
That's not what Ortiz said when he accepted his sentence.
Look, the guy spent, like, 100% of his time on the inside researching his case, and he found details that you guys didn't think to hunt for.
Before, you said you didn't believe that Ortiz was innocent.
Well...
How am I gonna tell you his wife killed Euley and still get my deal?
You don't know Cristian is innocent.
I know Euley's mother wrote Cristian in prison, asking why he killed her son a week after Euley broke it off with Liseth.
And Ortiz said his wife was the only other person who had access to all that stuff he brought home from the military, including his knife.
So she got rid of her boyfriend, who had the nerve to break up with her, and her husband at the same time.
But that's not the biggest news here.
Ortiz didn't just blame his ex-wife for all that.
Ye Gods.
He blamed you guys.
Who do you mean by "you guys"?
The LAPD.
Cristian's lawyers told him even though he might be innocent,
LAPD had enough physical evidence to put him away for the rest of his life.
Manslaughter is a good deal for murder...
Unless you didn't do it.
Take away somebody's future, and they could stay angry for a very long time.
So Cristian blames Liseth, and he blames us.
He wants to get revenge on the bitch, sure.
But also wants to take down the system that helped her.
I didn't do the autopsy, and knowing what we do now, I have issues.
What sort of issues?
We know that the murder weapon is consistent with the weapon Ortiz kept from his time in the service.
- A KA-BAR Marine knife.

Serrated blade on one side, razor-sharp on the other.
And we know that the initial attack was a downward stab into the soft tissue of the victim's neck.
The blade went all the way into the hilt.
And from the angle, we know that the attack came from behind.
The rest of the 16 stab wounds were to the victim's chest, straight in.
Means Euley probably collapsed and was stabbed from above.
That's exactly right, Detective Nolan.
Very good!
But there's one more thing.
The chest wounds were haphazardly inflicted.
Sloppy.

Not the work of a trained Marine.
And shallow for a guy the size of Ortiz.
- Very shallow.

I'm sure, if his public defender had ever received it.
But the Statement of Facts was completed based on the prelim.
The full autopsy report took 62 days to complete.
And Ortiz made his deal in 30.
Based on false assumptions.

What do we actually know here?
Ortiz spent 11 years in a cell claiming his innocence.
Whatever he did then, he's blowing stuff up now.
And he's definitely trying to kill his ex-wife.
And don't forget the whole
"taking down the system" thing, too.
Or the ordinary items in which Ortiz is hiding bombs.
I think maybe his ex-wife should stay with us just a little longer.
You know, to ensure her safety.
Yeah.

I mean, frightened enough... to tell us where her husband's knife was stored.
We could bring her a change of clothes and stuff to make her feel more comfortable.
That's a good place to start.
Let's get patrol to stop by her dad's house and pick up her things.
Meanwhile, I want to go over every LAPD incident report since Cristian started on his little thrift-store shopping spree.
I think it is possible that the rest of the LAPD has been operating under false assumptions, as well.
What is this?

Don't I have a right to leave?

We... we just wanna keep you safe while your ex is at large.
So what am I supposed to do, stay here until you catch Cristian?
Is that why you brought me my things?
Because I'm living here now?
What if you never catch him?

In an effort to locate your ex-husband, we've gone over everything from Joseph Euley's death again and again, looking for something we missed.
- And there's just one thing.

Where your husband kept the knife he used to stab your boyfriend to death.
Now back then, you told the police that this knife absolutely did not come from your home.
Yeah.

12 years is a long time to remember something you said.
Especially if it wasn't the truth.
Please, have a seat.

Why on Earth would that be important now?
Because if we knew where your ex kept the knife, he might've been keeping other stuff he stole from the Marines.
Yes, like the C-4 explosives that he used to try and murder you and your family.
And he has more of those explosives.

Now we'll see how scared she really is.
If we knew where the knife came from, we believe the rest of the C-4 may be there, as well.
And maybe even Cristian, too.
Really?

Well, it's our best hope.
So if you have any suspicion of where your ex-husband kept this knife...
Cristian had a storage unit that he used to keep all the things that he stole from the Marines.
He used to call it his "barracks."
He would go there all the time.

Well, thank you.

Now, this is very, very important.
Do you recall where this storage facility is located?
Um, could you write down the name, the address, and the number of the storage unit itself?
He doesn't just have knives or explosives.
He has guns.
And that's the beginning of her written confession.
How is that a confession?
Because she just admitted to knowing where the knife was, and now she's describing everything that was there.
It's gonna be hard to convict her of Euley's murder without her husband's statement.
And it doesn't get him off the hook for murdering her father.
Or the attempt on 50 people at the funeral.
But now we might just know where he is.
This could all be over very quickly.
Mike, where are we going?
Inside.

Ortiz is making bombs out of everything, and he's got a lot of C-4 left.
If there's a bomb, the dog will smell it, I promise.
Also, maintain complete radio discipline.
Good luck, people.
Now let's work this dog.

We've confirmed that Ortiz is renting space 108, just like his ex-wife told us.
- Now if he is there...

SIS has established a perimeter.
SWAT has elevated positions on buildings north and east.
Nah, if Ortiz tries to escape, he won't get far.
Thanks.

I'm telling you, Chief, I'm more worried about what he may have left behind.
Capra's being followed in by the rest of the Bomb Squad and thermal imaging to assess the storage unit.
No, if Mr. Ortiz planted something special for us, we'll soon know.
Buzz, thermal imaging online.
Doesn't look like much.
Doesn't have to.
But he was living here.

Capra, I'm putting you on speaker.
Captain, looks like we're all clear.
Okay, Lieutenant, give it a go.
Bomb Squad's ready to breach.
Negative.

Heading in now.
Check this out.
"I was innocent."
Not anymore.
This guy does not know subtle, does he?
No, but he knows us.
No sign of any of his thrift-store purchases.
I think I know why.
Holy crap.
Captain, we got a bunch of empty cellphone shells.
We see it, Lieutenant.

If Ortiz has torn apart that many cellphones, he's probably constructed a lot more bombs.
But where are they?
I don't think we have very much time to figure that out.
Yes?
Hey.

Rusty.

I'm Aiden Reed.
Gus told me so much about you.

Yeah.

And, um, thank you, Aiden.
Thank you so much just for all the... the great things that you've done for Gus.
We... we really appreciate it.
- Is he here or...?

When I heard you were coming by,
I sent him on a run with Chef to the fish market.
He was torn, but you know Gus, right?
- He always wants to go the extra mile.

It's one of the reasons I was a bit disappointed that he turned down this Napa opportunity.
But what can I do?
Gus can't see what's in his best interest 'cause he's in a relationship with a really, really insecure college student.
Does that come up a lot?
Gus saying no to you because he's already in a relationship.
Have you... have you been turned down before?
More like turned away.
But, yeah, he won't take me up on dinners out or drinks.
But I'm guessing that's because of everything you did for his sister.
Why else let a needy boy like you call all the shots when he could be doing so much better?
Like being with you?
That's why you're promoting him to Napa, isn't it?
Instead of here?
Or did the two-star Michelin chef that you hired just refuse to enter his kitchen unless Gus was there as his new right hand?
Are you really upset with me, or... or because you... you found someone that you can't buy?
Well...
I hear you know all about that.
Hey, why don't you tell Gus that it's not all his hard work or talent that I'm rewarding?
That his promotions are just because I'm physically attracted to him.
Please tell him that.
And if you won't, consider how Gus'll be constantly weighing what he sacrificed to hang around here while you grow up.
You think you're done making mistakes?
I'm pretty sure I could wait you out.
Speaking of which, I think Gus will be back any minute.
So, please have a seat.

It's on the house.
In addition to the bombs that have already went off, these cellphone shells are an indication that there's at least 20 explosive devices planted somewhere around the city.
- But where?

There was blood on the radio and under it, meaning it was meant to be collected as evidence.
If we had booked it, that radio would have ended up in one of our evidence lockers.
It should've been brought here, where we would have kept it until we tried the murderer.
Yes.

And the fact that we had physical evidence, which turned out to be less than it seemed.
My God.
There are 21 LAPD divisions.
That's 21 evidence lockers, plus the bomb at the cemetery.
That's our 22 cellphones.
He doesn't just want revenge on his wife.
He wants to screw the entire LAPD, too, the way we screwed him.
I know the justice system might not be always fair to everyone, but if he'd only given us a chance...
We could have made it all better?
Buzz, look, I know it's hard to accept, but not everybody wants our help.
How are we supposed to locate every bomb in every evidence locker when Ortiz could detonate any of them any second?
We may have a solution for that.

Each of the cellphone shells found in Mr. Ortiz's storage locker has a lot number for quality control and recalls.
But in this situation, we can translate each of the serial numbers from the cell casings into actual phone numbers.
And by knowing all the phone numbers...
We can block each cellphone.
Well, that will make them pretty much useless as detonation devices.

20 cellphones?

Also, we need to evacuate every evidence facility at every division in the LAPD.
- We're on it.

One other thing.

But he had to call the cellphone he planted at the cemetery.
Okay, so we know the phone number this asshole is going to use to detonate the rest of his bombs.
Which means we can start pinging his location... right now.

Here we go.
We have him.

He's across the street.
At City Hall!
It looks like he's up in the tower.
And the only good thing about that is, considering City Hall's security, he's probably not armed.
No, but he can still make calls.
Buzz, the blocking!
Six, sir.

- Buzz!

Just give me two minutes.
We need to take him down where he is right now.
If he sees a bunch of police converging on City Hall, he'll start calling in his C-4.
And if he doesn't have a weapon, well, shooting him's out of the question.
He took our pictures at the cemetery.
He knows who we are.

- Buzz!

And yelling doesn't make it go faster.
Mike, place City Hall on lock down, please.
Yes, Ma'am.
There's the matter of Liseth.
He tried to blow her up first.
- We can't forget...

That he may still be trying to kill her.
We can worry about her later.
She's here where he can't get her.
18.

I say that we give him a warning.
19.

Blocked.
Except for the cell he used to call.
All right, Captain, what are you waiting for?
The last time I called a killer standing in a high place, he jumped.
And the trouble with that is?
- Yeah?

How can I help you, Captain?
By listening very closely.
We have effectively blocked every cellphone that you have set up as a detonation device in every evidence locker in every division you have compromised.
City Hall is now on lock down.
Shortly, you will be surrounded.
My advice, sir...

We will find you an attorney and...
And what?

You got to be kidding me.
There's no deal for me in this.
I'm responsible for the death of an LAPD civilian officer.
I murdered my former father-in-law in cold blood.
But you didn't kill Joseph Euley.
Your ex-wife did that.

And we know how she did it.
You're lying.
No.

Now, listen, son, you've done some terrible things, and... and you're gonna have to answer for them.
But if you want your wife to also pay for what she did, we need you to testify.
You're ready to arrest her?

Yes, we do.
You wanna talk to me?
Well, I wanna talk to her.

Hold on, sir.

Mr. Ortiz, you are here with your ex-wife.
You are on speaker.
Wait.

You listening to me, you bitch?
I spent 11 years in a box because of you.
11 years!
And now you're gonna pay.
Okay, listen to this, sir.
- Liseth Ortiz, you are under arrest...

For murder in the first degree...
- No!

- Get your hands off of me!

Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed for you
- by the state.

You framed him too well.

Mr. Ortiz, Liseth will pay for this.
She'll pay, but not how you think.
I had to splurge after the cemetery.
I needed a couple of genuine smartphones that I could use to ping each other, just like you pinged this crappy old disposable we're talking on now.
That's right.
I got me two new phones.
Well... only one with me.
The other one is showing up where I planted it.
Over there with you guys.
Gotta love these phone-tracking apps.
Good luck finding it.
By the way, tell me, Captain, how long have you had my bitch of an ex-wife in custody?
LAPD!

Lose the phone and get on your knees now!
Or what?
You'll shoot?

Yeah, well, you're a big guy, and I feel threatened.
- I'll take a chance!

But if I'm under arrest, aren't I allowed a phone call?
It's a waste of time.

Really?
The luggage!
The bomb is in the luggage!

Go!

Come on.

Flynn.
Flynn, tell me you have that son of a bitch.
Yeah, I got him.

How is everybody?

Yeah, hold on.
Hold on.
Andy, what are you doing over there?
It... it's just a walk across the street.
And I'm the only guy this asshole didn't know.
I'm more worried about you guys.
- Are you okay?

We're okay.
We all g...

I should've shot you.
Lucky for your mom and everybody the bomb didn't hurt anyone.
And I'm really glad you weren't there.
Look, I-I gotta get going.

- for a party...

I've been thinking ever since we spoke about it...
My Uber's coming.
I know...

I've been thinking about it, Gus, and the next time I visit you at work,
I want it to be in Napa.
What?
I didn't...

So much of what we were doing,
I didn't understand it was on my terms.
And that's wrong.
And we can't do it anymore.
But if... if you're going to stay here...
I am.
But this opportunity in Napa, it's... it's... it's what's best for your career, which is every bit as important as mine.
So we'll... we'll try the long-distance thing.
Besides, I'll be too busy here to get into any trouble.
And I'm sure that Aiden will...
Aiden will keep you very busy, too.
- I'm not asking you for this.

I'm doing it because I love you, Gus, and because I want you to be happy.
And you deserve to be with, um...
Where.

Rusty.
You always surprise me.
Okay.
We're gonna make this a good thing, all right?
And then you can come up, and I'll be coming down here.
And we'll be stronger for it in the end.
Right.

Your Uber.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Well, it all worked out.
But before we go on, I, I just wanna say if not for you, we'd be cleaning up a mess like this at every division in the city.
And more officers would have died.
Ortiz may be nuts, but planting C-4 inside items we'd pick up from crime scenes was a smart plan.
Depraved, but smart.
Can you take a minute?
Yeah, join me in the...
Assistant Chief's Office?
For something which I think is a good surprise.
My God.
If you're not Assistant Chief...
You are being asked for.
That is not a good surprise.
The alternative would've been Winnie Davis.
Just come with me, Captain... if I can still call you that for the next minute or so.
This is it.

Or it's Fritz.
Anyone but Davis.
It has to be the Captain.
Can they ignore what she just did here?
Yeah?

Hey, check this out.
Roaches, rats, and Provenza.
They can survive anything.
Looks like I drew the short straw.
Congratulations, Leo!
This is an excellent, excellent choice.
I couldn't agree more.
And I truly appreciate you allowing me to keep my old office at Piper Tech, which I'm about to go back to right now, if you'll excuse me.
And... congrats to you, too, Sharon.
Would it be out of line for me to say how relieved I am?
Not at all.
Though your work may be a little bit more difficult.
Fortunately,
Commander Raydor,
I think you're up to the job.
Commander?
Welcome to the top brass.
