Previously on Lucifer...

I killed him.
Where's Uriel?
Oh.
You look really familiar.

35 years ago, Father asked me to come down here to bless a couple who was unable to have a child.
God put her in Lucifer's path.
Why are you so upset?
Because I just don't know if it's real.
Why is it that sometimes I'm immortal, and other times I'm all too human?
Appears you make me vulnerable.
What's in that package is far more valuable than drugs.
You're a bad man.
Dr. Jason Carlisle.

Freeze!
We are talking designer poison, here.
So, how do we get an antidote?
Well, that right there is the tricky part.
Designer poisons need designer antidotes.
Detective!
It won't stop.
Lucifer.
The bleeding stopped.

You've forgotten you've been poisoned, Detective, or has it already reached your brain?
Maybe it's just a nosebleed.

How could the professor have injected me?
I didn't get one of his flu shots.
What about when you went after him?
Well, I don't know.
I tackled him to the ground, we-we struggled for a bit, and, God, I guess if he injected me somehow, it would have to be just...
Ugh.

Everything's gonna be fine once we get to the hospital.
Okay?
We can't go to the hospital.
What?
Lucifer, going to the hospital didn't help any of the other victims.
The only thing that's gonna save my life is finding the antidote.
Otherwise, I'm...
All right.

No judgments, guys, okay?
You said come right away, so I came right away.
You're lucky I remembered to put on pants... eventually.

Well, um...

Oh, I doubt it.
I asked every hospital in the area to report anything even resembling a poisoning.
So far, haven't heard a peep.
Well, just to be sure, let's, uh, let's go over what you found at the professor's lab, okay?
Check it out.
Uh, Detective.
We should tell her.
No, we can't.
She'll freak out.

I really don't think this is a good idea.
Are you guys done having your whisper fight?
Uh, just make out already and get it over with.

So...

It had a tiny bit of poison left in it, so, yeah, in theory, someone out there may have been dosed.
Hmm.

Mm-hmm.

I did.
Problem is, dude destroyed whatever was inside.
Dick move, right?
I mean, that's why I'm glad no one's reported to any hospitals, 'cause without the antidote, ugh, they'd end up just like the other victims.
You know, first a bloody nose and then fainting spells, followed by seizures...

And then their guts slowly start boiling, like, literally boiling.
It's so gross and nasty, and 24 hours later... bam, just like that, dead as a doornail.

You've painting quite the picture, Miss Lopez.

Yeah, let's go over everything else
- from the professor's lab.

Just to see if we've missed anything.
Okay?

Okay.

Here we go.
I got your text.

Uh... this way.
Somewhere we can speak in private.
Was this part of Father's plan?
Hmm?
Answer me, brother, before I rip your spine out and beat you to death with it.
What are you talking about?
How long... how long have you been manipulating me?
Mom told you about Chloe?
Oh, that she did.
And that you put the detective in my path.
No, I didn't.
Father did.
I was just another pawn in His game.
I had no idea.
And the detective?
Is she simply another pawn as well or is she...
Is she?
She doesn't know anything.
Listen.
Luci, we've been played like puppets.
Father has manipulated us both.
Don't you dare compare our situations.
All that I have ever wanted to do for all of my existence was make Father proud.
I thought I was doing great works in His name.
Instead, the very first of His angels was busy making you a little girlfriend.
Oh.

We're on the same side here, brother.
Are we?
Then be honest with me, brother.
How deep does Father's plan go?
Is the detective's poisoning part of it?
Poisoning?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You really don't know?
No.
Then you... you can't help her.
I'm sorry.
There you are.

Amenadiel.
Give us a minute.
I... have an idea.

Okay, so the professor's been using this Burt guy to smuggle in the poisons.
What, so you think that Burt might have smuggled the antidotes as well?
Yes.

Point me to his prison cell.
Perhaps some toilet wine waterboarding or...
Well, he's already out on bail, but the good news is, he does have an ankle bracelet so he can't get far.
Detective.
I'm fine.

They think they can keep me down.
Me!
Well, screw them!
I'll party every night until the trial, and then every day once I'm found...
Innocent!
Oh, sorry.

No.

Have we met before?
Weren't you at that beach party?
Yeah.

So, why don't you show me the bedroom?
You read my mind.
So... oh.
Uh.
Y-You okay?
Oh... um...
Yeah, yeah.
No, no, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

Uh... yeah.

No, that doesn't really work for me.
Hey, what the hell is this?
Hello, Burtrude.
Remember me?
You didn't hurt him, did you?
Physically, no, as I promised.
Too bad.

What?

Unfortunately, yes, but he did provide me with a lead.
The professor hired Burt through some middleman, a chap named Dave Maddox.
There's a good chance the professor got the antidotes from him.
Oh.
Detective?

Wait.

Yeah.

You sure?

Detective!
Detective!
What the hell were you thinking?
I thought I was being quite responsible bringing her directly to the hospital.
You mean after the two of you went off and interrogated a felon on bail?

It was much easier to get her here unconscious.
You know how stubborn she can get.
It doesn't change the fact that...
You guys know that I'm right here, yeah?
Hey.
Hey.
How you feeling?
Fine.
Lucifer, I told you no hospitals.
How am I supposed to find the antidote if I'm laying here... ow.
Shh.
We'll take it from here.
Yes.

And we'll start by following up on your lead.
Dave Maddox.

Thank you.
Is Trixie here?
She should be any minute.
I'll go check.
I don't want Trixie to get scared seeing me like this.
Do I look okay?
You... you look heaven-sent.
Just... follow my lead and don't do anything unless I say, okay?
If that's what it takes, then you have my word.
Dearie me, these are atrocious.
What self-respecting artist would actually display these?
Dave Maddox isn't a real artist.
To say the least.
All this is just a front.
See, criminals like Maddox, they use art sales to cover up money transfers.
They could demand any price for a piece of art, and in return provide whatever it is their clients really want.
Can he provide an eye bath?

There he is.
Remember what I said.
My word is my bond.
Dave Maddox?
We need to talk.
Just one moment, all right?
No, it's urgent.
It's about your other business.
Specifically, with Professor Jason Carlisle.
Help us get the professor's antidote, and we'll get out of your children's art festival.
Can you just... give me one minute?

I... have no idea what you're talking about.
Don't mess with us right now, man, it's my wife...

My ex-wife's life is on the line.
You... so you're trying to help your ex-wife?
Something's wrong with you, buddy.
Maybe not the best time to push that particular button.
Yeah?
If she's anything like my ex,
I say let her die.
Now, see, I would do this myself, but painting hand and all that.
You are making a big mistake.
You're right.
I can just find something to hit you with!
Duh!
Right, I'm not sure what lead I'm following here, but am I supposed to let them punch me, too?
What?

I screwed up.

I let my anger get the better of me and now Chloe's gonna pay for it.
What, so this isn't some elaborate game of bloody possum?
Of course not!
Oh, well, in that case...
Wait, are you kidding me?
You could have gotten out of those this whole time?
Well, of course I could.
Right, catch.
Why the hell didn't you stop them from beating the crap out of me?
Because I promised you
I wouldn't do anything without your permission.
Oh, right.

Right.
- This is gonna have to...

Right.
Since torture takes too long and Dan's already wasted so much time, why don't we speed things along and make a deal?
You have something we want.
What would you like in return?
Wait, what?
Quickly, now.

I want...
Hmm?
I-I want someone to buy my art because they actually like it.
Clients only buy my paintings because they're forced to as part of our deal, but...
I know they just throw 'em away.
And treat 'em like trash.
An insult to trash.
All I want... more than anything, is just... is to be treated like a real artist.
Really?

Well, miracles aren't my thing, but I'm sure we can come to an arrangement.
The sacrifices we make for the greater good.
What?

Ah.
Here you go.
What is this?
It's the antidote ingredients
I gathered for Professor Carlisle.
Well, what about the formula?
What about it?
We need to know the amounts of each ingredient he used.
If we get it wrong, it could be lethal.
The professor kept the formula all to himself.
He liked to brag about how the only place it existed was in his head.
You'd... you'd have to ask him.
Yeah, well, we can't do that.
He's dead.
Oh.
Um... you still want the painting though, right?
Uh...
Amenadiel told me about your detective.
I'm sorry, son.
I can't even go in there.
I'd have to tell her how monumentally screwed she is.
Or... or lie.
And we both know I can't do that.
Well, if it's any consolation, you of all people should know that the man that did this is right where he belongs:
suffering in Hell.
You're right.

Well, I'm glad I was able to comfort you.
No, no, Mum, you figured it out.
How I'm gonna save the detective.
Um, I'm not sure I understand.
I'm gonna pop down to Hell and have a chat with the professor.
What?

Well, it's simple.
All I need to do is die.
The plan is simple:
you kill me, I go down to Hell, interrogate the professor, get the formula and then you bring me back.
Well, come on!

This is a terrible idea.

I hate to agree with Her Highness, but she's right.
You'd be on your own.
We both know
I can't go down with you.
Well, I went down and came back once before, it wasn't a problem.
That's because Father brought you back.
And you didn't go through any of the doors.
Once you do, you could be trapped... forever.
Well, that won't happen, will it?
I'm the Lord of Hell, for crying out loud.
You were the Lord of Hell.
You've been away quite a long time.
You can't be certain that this will work.
What do you think?
I think... that I followed about half of that.
Do you guys do this a lot?
Like, celestial planning sessions?
Oh, apparently not.

Oh...

Yeah, well, turnabout's fair play.
Hmm.
Okay, wrapping my brain around this...
Lucifer, what makes you so sure you'd go to Hell?
In case you've missed it, doctor,
I've been banned from Heaven.
There's no where else for me to go.
And you're sure there's no other way to get there?
I mean...
I mean, dying?
Well, if anyone has a better suggestion, by all means, speak up now.
Quite frankly, I'd prefer to Uber there.
But... look, I am doing this with or without you.
Well, I'm sorry.
Having spent millennia in that terrible place,
I can't be part of you going back.
Not even for a moment.
Fine.
Amenadiel?
Are you coming?
No, Mom, I'm gonna help.
Chloe, she doesn't deserve this.
This is the craziest plan
I've ever heard.
I'm in.
Doctor, surely you have some sensible advice.
Um, he's the Devil.
Nothing's really been sensible since I found that out.
I will not help you get trapped down there.
Not for some insignificant human's life.
Okay.
Now that party pooper's gone, let's get started, shall we?
So, um, what's my part in all of this?
Well, you went to medical school, correct?
Many... many, many, many years ago.
Good.

Okay, who wants to kill me?
Ah, Daniel, there you are.

What?

Besides, those ingredients are useless without the formula.
Well, you might want to hop on it, because I'm about to get the formula.
What?

Fairly certain you don't want to know.
Well, you...

Ella and I will get those ingredients.
Right.
This is crazy.
I can't do this.
Yeah, and neither can I.
These scrubs are so boxy.
Even I can't pull 'em off.
Scratch that.
I can pull off anything.
Yes, you're right.

We can do this, right?
We have to.
Chloe's life depends on it.

This is the room directly below Chloe's.
Make sure no one moves the detective.
I'll be in the room below, but she needs to remain in there for this to work.
Because being close to her makes you vulnerable.
Well, killable, in this case, but yes.
So I keep her here until you're dead?
No, no, no.

Even after you've already been killed?
Well, who knows what happens if I become invulnerable when I'm already dead.
There's a good chance the doctor won't be able to revive me.
And we don't want me to stay dead, do we?
That was a rhetorical question.
Right.

And you trust me with this?
Brother, you're the most stubborn, bullheaded person I know.
If anyone can prevent the detective from being moved, it's you.
Luci?
What?

Good luck.
Don't worry, brother.
It feels like a good day to die.
Ella?
We got a package from CDC.
How many more ingredients do we need?
Well, based off the list from that middleman dude, we've gathered all but one:
a chemical called ZX3.
Super rare, super illegal.
How rare?
Let's put it this way:
all my legal contacts are out of this stuff.
Wait, you have illegal contacts?
You don't?

Some street racers secretly add drops of ZX3 to their fuel for a super shady advantage.
How do you know that?
I used to steal cars.
It's not fun if you don't drive 'em really, really fast.
Anyway,
I know where some black market ZX3 is locked up:
a chop shop in NoHo.
Problem is, I'm not sure I can get the owner to hand it over.
And we don't have time for a warrant.
Well, desperate times...
Call for a little BE.
Mm-hmm.

Right, so one zap of this doohickey will stop my heart?
Uh, the defibrillator wasn't made for that, but yes.
Not what I thought I'd be doing with my day.
I'm gonna give you 60 seconds, then restart your heart to bring you back.
60 seconds?

Time moves much slower down there.

Yes, but we only get one shot at this.
What if you yank me out before I get the formula?
60 seconds is already cutting it closer than I'd like.
The brain only lasts three minutes after death.
Or so I read.
Just now.

Why am I doing this again?
Because you care about saving the detective's life almost as much as I do.
Now, come on!
I also care about your life, Lucifer!
Okay, ice to slow your brain cells from dying, and painkillers to, well, kill the pain.
Got it covered, thanks.
Okay, Maze, just like I showed you.
Yeah, got it.
Okay.

I can't!

No, the deal was you kill him, I bring him back.
But you're the doctor!

Goodness sake.
Whoa!
Oh, my God.
He's dead.
He's really dead.
Who are you?
I'm Amenadiel.
I'm Lucifer's brother.
He, uh, asked me to watch over your mom.
Like a guardian angel?
I like your necklace.
Thanks.
I, um, I like yours too.
A bad man did this to my mommy.
Why are there bad people in the world?
I really don't know.
There might be bad people in the world, but you know what?
There's a lot more good people in it.
Really?
Yeah.
Like all the good people helping out your mom.
Like you?
Well, I'm, uh...
I'm trying to be good.
I think you're good.
Yes.
About bloody time.
Help!
Help!
Hey, hey, man, I'm tra...

Hey, can you help me?

Just take my...
What?

Hey, man, I'm trapped!
You can't leave me here!
Hey!

Coward.

No.

Monster.

Killer.

No, you don't understand.
I had no choice.
Leave me alone!
Please!

No!
Professor Jason Carlisle.
Remember me?
It keeps happening.

It's like I'm in Hell!
There's no "like" about it.
What is this?
This is a torture of your own making.
Fueled by guilt.
With a little bit of flair thrown in for fun.
Please.
I need to get out of here.
How do I get out?
Well, it's quite simple, you can't.
What?

And I have never seen anyone pull themselves out of here.
Oh, God, no, no, no.
No, no...

Anything.

How do I make amends?
Well, before you so rudely ended your own life, you poisoned a detective.
Someone who I care about very much.
There's still time to save her.
So, if you give me the formula to her antidote, perhaps your guilt might be alleviated.
Yeah?
Tick tock, Professor!
There.
The formula.
Does that make us good?
You tell me.
I didn't think so.
No.
No, please!
No!
No!

Where's a resurrection when you need one?
Could really use my flask right about now.
I never could play as well as you, brother.
Uriel...
I...
I know.
It's a lot to take in, isn't it?
I don't...
I-I don't understand, Azrael's blade, it should've destroyed you, not sent you to Hell.
You don't deserve to be here, brother.
You're right, I don't.
But you do.
You think it's that easy to let go?
Think again, brother.
No.

What's happening?
I need to save the detective.
But you just can't help yourself, can you?
You have to believe me,
I didn't want this.
And yet... 60 seconds!

I thought you said this would work, Linda!
Shh!

No, no, no!
What was I thinking?
This was always a terrible idea.
You know, we are not cat burglars.
We are totally gonna get caught.
"Cat burglars"?
What are you, an old-timey desperado?
I'm just saying we're a little out of our element.
Speak for yourself.
Yeah, I noticed.
Where'd you learn to pick a lock like that?
My grandma.
Wow.
And what exactly are we looking for again?
Hey!
You picked the wrong place to rob.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I can't make it stop.
"It?"
As if you had no part in it.
I don't!

I-I don't want this!
Look at you.
So pitiful.
Stuck in the very Hell you once ruled.
Trapped by your own guilt.
And while we're pointing out how lame you are, you didn't even follow up on that thing I told you.
What I whispered in your ear before I died.
What?
"The peace is here"?
The peace is here.
I...

The... the final ramblings of a dying brain.

Unless you're saying you found peace in that moment, brother.
Oh, Luci, Luci, Luci.
You should know better than that.
I'm all about patterns, predicting the future.
My last words were a clue.
A clue?

Well, you're the one who has to figure that out, aren't you?
After all,
I'm just in your head.
I'm just a manifestation of your own guilty conscience.
Speaking of...
Ouch.
No.
I hope you didn't leave any unfinished business up on Earth...

'cause you're never getting out of here.
What's happening?
Doctor just paged us.

I don't know.
Let's go wait outside, okay?

It's okay, I'm gonna stay with your mom.
Go with the nurse.
Go ahead and turn her on her side.
Crash cart standing by.
She's seizing.
This isn't right.
Something's wrong in Hell.
What?
He's stuck.
Trapped in one of those cells.
That's why we can't revive him.
Okay, so then what do we have to do to bust him out?
Someone needs to go down there and pull him out.
I'd go, but I can't.
Why not?
Demons don't have a soul.
If I die,
I just... die.
Okay, that's definitely a discussion topic for another time, but right now, every second counts.
And I can't believe I'm saying this, but... what if I go?

You?

There are things you don't know about me.
No.

Send me.
Well.
Look who decided to show up.
I'll go down and get him.
You said you'd never go back.
Yes, I have a paralyzing fear of the place.
But I would face a thousand Hells to save my son.
Ever since I escaped,
Hell's been constantly trying to pull me back.
It's only my resistance that allows me to fight its pull.
So, I just... won't resist.
So, how do we do this?
It appears that we need to attach these little wires to the skin...
Maze!
Oops.
She's still in V-tach.
- Midazolam, four milligrams.

Thanks.
Get it in that line.
I got the IV.
There we go.
Okay.
We need to move her to CT.
I'll call them.
Sir.

I can't let her leave.
We're trying to save her life.
So am I.
Security.
Security!
I can explain.
Just...

Yeah.

Before I shoot you for busting into my place...
Ricardo!

No seas estúpido.
Lower the gun.
W-What...
Ella?
What are you doing here?
You know this guy?
Only since birth.
Dan, meet Ricardo, my idiot brother.
- I'm not an idiot.

Thieving, cowardly, neglectful idiot.
This is your brother?

Then why didn't you just ask him for the ZX3?
'Cause after I moved out here to keep an eye on him, he totally ghosted me!
I get it.

You want to keep your law enforcement sis away from your shady shenanigans.
Watch.

I don't have any ZX3.
We're not here to bust you.
Yeah, man.

Totes illegal.

You know better.

Ricky.
The ZX3's for a friend.
Without it, she's gonna die.
And I really don't want her to die.
Follow me.
I hate you.
I love you, too.
I-I know.

Hurts you more than it does me.
Please, please, forgive me, brother.
I had no choice.
Do you really believe that?
No.
Lucifer!
Mum?
What are you doing here?
I'm your rescue party of one.
You don't belong down here.
Not anymore.
But look.
Look what I've done.
Lucifer, this Uriel isn't real.
I wish he was.
I so badly want to see my son again.
But he's just a part of your Hell.
No.
You were... you were just trying to save us.
This isn't your fault.
It's mine.
I am to blame for all of this.
Ever since... ever since I returned, I've been...
I've been manipulating you.
Stoking your anger against your Father in hopes of using you against Him.
But... but I've just made things worse.
I pushed you and that human closer, knowing it would crush you when you learned the truth.
And now look at us.
Stuck in this prison while Chloe is dying.
Chloe.
No.

To save the detective.
And I need to save her now.
Mum.

Mum?
Why would we leave?
Uriel is right here.
We can stay.
Be a happy family.
I've missed you so much, Mother.
Mum?
Mum.
Mum!
Come on.

Come on!

Not again.

No...
No.

No, please.
Shh.

My sweet boy!
- He's not real.

My sweet boy.
Uriel!
Well.
Look who's back.
You didn't die after all.
That makes one of us.
I heard you saved me.
Well... much as I'd like to take all the credit, this one was a... a team effort.
You know, this whole poisoning thing has just... really put a pause on everything that's been going on with you and I, so... should we just pick up where we left off?
I think, right now, you just need to focus on feeling better, Detective.
Would you have someone bring Trixie in?
Yes.

And we'll talk.
We'll talk later, yeah?
How is the detective?
She'll be fine.
And... what about the two of you?
Well, it was never real, was it?
Lucifer, I am so sorry.
Father brought her into existence just to put her in my path.

The whole thing's been a sham, Mum.
Long con.
And I fell for it.
You can't blame yourself.
This is all His doing.

Oh, make no mistake, I plan on that.
I mean, how can I trust anything, anyone, now that I know He might be behind it all?
Well, you can trust me.
Can I, Mum?
Yeah.

Worse, maybe.
At least He doesn't pretend to love me.
Lucifer.
I do love you.
I went back to Hell for you.
I helped save the detective, for you.
Doesn't that count for anything?
It's too little too late, Mother.
You set out to break my heart.

Lucifer...

No more manipulations.
This feud that you have with Father, I refuse to be caught in the middle any longer.
I am tired of being a pawn.
So, no more.
I'm done.
Lucifer.
Lucifer.
Hey.
It's me again.
Voicemail 337.
Obnoxious, right?

It's just that you...

So, hide the strippers.
Um...
Yeah, um....
I just hope you're okay.
Okay.
Bye.
Lucifer?
Are you here?
Lucifer?
