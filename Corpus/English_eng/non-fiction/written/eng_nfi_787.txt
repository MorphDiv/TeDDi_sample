Previously on "Blacklist:

Remember, Whitehall... she has to tell you about Whitehall.
Your accomplice...

He's your son.
I don't know anything about Whitehall.
If you tell me, nothing will happen to you.
Who are you?
I am Richard Whitehall.
Whitehall has cracked quantum computing.
A computer with this kind of speed would mean the end of privacy as we know it.
If Scottie moves from a prototype to a working model, the woman would be unstoppable.
As of today, I will do everything in my power to take back control of the company that I created.
I know you're watching, honey, and I'm coming for you.
Yeah, I got it.

Oh, my God.

Yeah.
- All right.

Hey!

You-you can't go in there!
_
Quantum computing is like a skeleton key.
The original mainframe computers were the size of this room.
You know a computer that's 10,000 times more powerful?
This.
That's the difference between what's being used today and what anyone who gets their hands on Whitehall's device will be using tomorrow.
Today, cellphones, laptops are vulnerable.
Tomorrow, it'll be banking, classified systems, troop movements, nuclear codes.
Scottie's holding Whitehall inside Halcyon.
We can't just walk him out.
No.

Of Halcyon?

My plan "B" is already under way.
The reason I went public is to force the board to call a meeting to decide who to believe,
Scottie or me.
The board already sided with her.
I'm not going in to lobby for votes.
I'm going in through the front to enable you to launch a tactical assault through the back.
- How are we gonna do that?

All you have to worry about is assembling a team that'll stay off of Halcyon's radar.
High risk, low probability of success.
Got any takers?
Yeah, I think I do.
We talked about this.

I'm sorry.
We didn't talk about it.
I told you I knew about you and Kat, that you were sleeping with my assistant.
You apologized.
That's acknowledgment, not talk.
Do you want to talk about it?
No, 'cause there's nothing to talk about.
'Cause if we did talk about it,
I'd probably end up taking that ice pick and stabbing you with it.
The board meeting... are you worried?
Of course.

But I have a few tricks to play.
- What's this?

I need your vote in the board meeting.
- Where did you get this?

Your soon-to-be ex is asking for full custody of Isaac and Hannah.
She's not getting it, once a judge sees her snorting her child-support payments.
Of course I'm with you.
Good.
Can't afford to have Howard upend everything we've been working on.
Looking for a refill?
Nah, I'm trying to kick it.
I'm here to sell you on something.
We got a business proposal for you.
Hands up.
Now.
What's in there?
We need your help.

This is the first installment.
We don't need your money.
Well, that's good, because I didn't bring any.
Mm.
Taaffeite.
A million times scarcer than diamonds.
Retail price, $4,000 a carat.
You're looking at 1,000 carats.
You do the math.
You trust her?
She cool.
Kind of help you looking for?
The kind that could get you killed.
So?
So, enhanced interrogation works.
And since you don't want me using it on señor Whitehall, the results are mixed.
Maybe he's working with Howard, maybe not.
I'll talk to him.

Escort him in.

He's here for Whitehall, which means he's got a plan to get him out.
Curing certain cancers, making more effective drugs, discovering distant planets, driver-less cars.
That is the promise of my inventions.
Healthier, smarter, safer.
There are so many rewards.
But all you see is the evil this can do.
Why is that?
Because someone has to live in the shadows so others can live in the light.
I'll take him from here.
Scottie asked me to escort you to the board.
Phyllis.
- It's wonderful to see you.

Jesse.
- How are the twins?

Bob.

- Do any of you really think...

... I'm capable of trying to murder my husband?
I do.
Scottie.
Howard.
What's the matter?
You all look like you've seen a ghost.
So, who do you want to hear from first?
I say brains before beauty.
So, Scottie, you're up.
Morning.
Nothing about any HVAC units today.
Well, I have four in the back, three other trips to make by lunch.
Can I leave them with you?
- Let...

If this feels like déjà vu all over again, that's because it is.
Six months ago, I came before the board because I had concluded... that the husband I loved and adored was gone, that he had become delusional, and that it was your fiduciary responsibility to remove him as head of this company.
My company... which I created, in all my delusional grandeur.
You agreed with my assessment then, and everything that's happened since only reinforces the conclusion that Howard is not of sound mind.
By his own admission, he faked his death.
Howard's not well.
But he is dangerous.
Since his tragic death,
Howard's been pursuing the Holy Grail of the digital age... quantum computing.
Quantum computing's a pipe dream.
No, it's not.

The man responsible for the breakthrough is here.
As a prisoner.
He's here so my husband can't force him to give him his technology.
Howard knew about it, pursued it... in secret, away from us, from this company.
Why would he do that?
There's only one explanation.
Howard is no longer working for this company.
He is working against it.
It's simple.

It'd be a lot simpler if we had real bullets.
- They do.

Whitehall's being held by people we know.
They believe they're doing the right thing.

So tranqs only.

Everything else gets left in the van.
Everything.
I am not normal.
And I have no interest in being normal.
I think normal is boring.
I believe in conspiracies.
I think delusions are the same as dog whistles.
Just because you can't hear them or see them doesn't mean they're not real.
We breach on Howard's signal.
Now, not being normal isn't the same as being nuts.
Nuts would be faking your own death, and I didn't do that.
You pretended to be dead.
Isn't that the same thing?
I didn't fake my death.

- Oh, come on, that's ridiculous.

This is... a preliminary report of the NTSB, indicating that the landing gear on my plane had been tampered with.
- See this?

The conference-room table is covered with smart glass and is smart enough to read that.
What'll the code tell it to do?
Calculate chess positions for 100,000 games played simultaneously.
You're gonna overheat the servers.
Triggering a cooling protocol, which includes opening the air vents from the server room to the parking lot.
We're in.

This warning light means the servers are overheating, and they never overheat.
I got to run a diagnostics.
Get a tac team up to Level A.
The NTSB report is inconclusive.
Someone tampered with your landing gear, but it could've been you.
And Scottie could be holding Dr. Whitehall against his will to protect him from me and not to force him to build a prototype of his invention, but I think we all know that she's not.
Of course, we could ask him.
What do you think, honey?

Shh.
You guys shouldn't be here.
Who the hell are these guys?
You don't want to know.
We need the access codes.

Yeah, well, you did try to decapitate Solomon.
No, we threw a bomb on his head.

But just give us the codes.
He's fine, by the way.

- Why don't I go tell him you're here?

If you don't tell me Whitehall's location and the code in the next five seconds...
I will shoot you with a tranq dart in the face.
You would do that?
Try me.
LeBron.
Really?

Cleveland against the world.
The allegations you both made... could not be more serious.
They are, and should be, the subject of a criminal investigation.
The final decision of the board will rest in part... on the outcome of that investigation, but that could take months, if not years.
The company needs a direction now.
Aah!

By a show of hands, all those in favor of restoring Howard Hargrave as CEO.
Don't shoot!

Aah!
All those in favor of keeping Scottie Hargrave in charge.
Tranqs were a bad idea.

- Zip-tie these guys.

Vito!

Oh, man.
Solomon.
Nez.
Nez, come on.

You guys hang here and wait for Howard's orders.
Howard, I'm sorry.
The vote was five to two against you.
A count I assume Scottie bought and paid for.
I didn't come here to win your vote, Jack.
That's him.

Then, why did you come?
To rescue Whitehall.
Oh, and h-how do you plan on doing that?
By taking over this facility.
Hear that?
Anyone?
That is the sound of a dog whistle.
What is this, Howard?
You want to tell us what the hell's going on?
- Patience.

Dr. Whitehall will be released from Mrs. Hargrave's confinement shortly, and he will explain.
- If you don't release us...

When you hear the truth, when you hear what this woman has been willing to do...
Stay put.

Your chariot has arrived.
Ah, ah, ah.
Howard.
Don't make him do something you might regret.
Let's go.
We need to get to Whitehall.
Tom and Nez might already be there.
We know where he is.

And after we get him?

I don't know yet.
I'm taking it one crisis at a time.
Great idea.
Hold on, everyone.

These two fine gentlemen, misters...
Devon.
Jimmy.
Mr. Devon and Mr. Jimmy are here to protect you.
You really have lost your mind.
No one leaves.
- Time to go.

Go!

Scottie!
With me... now.
I want you to bring up the sub-basement.
- The surveillance feeds, schematics?

Scottie, stop!
Go!
The code doesn't work.
And these windows are bulletproof.
He's having way too much fun.
What's going on?

I changed the key code.
Buys us a little time but not much.
Howard has control of the system.

Not anymore.
They knocked us off the grid.

Scottie's got Whitehall barricaded in the sub-basement.
Wouldn't cutting the power cause the doors to automatically unlock?
In the even of a power loss, the lock will automatically engage.
What about the cargo elevator?
That's not on the reserve system.

Meaning we can't get in.
Oh, there are other ways to get in.
Damn it.
Solomon, put her on the phone.
Scottie, think about this.
You can't get out, and in four minutes, we're coming in.
I'm not giving him to Howard.
You don't have a choice.
Howard... remember the World Summit on Innovation?

We stayed up all night working on your speech, how quantum computing would outstrip human capabilities, that if its development wasn't managed carefully, humanity would risk engineering its own extinction?
You convinced me then we could never let that kind of power fall into the hands of some deranged, maniacal madman.
I just never thought that madman would be you.
You're not in the boardroom anymore, honey.
You can drop the act.
Scottie, you don't have any leverage.
Of course I do.
Please don't make me use it.
Come through that door, and I will put a bullet through Whitehall's head.
The hell you will!
Scottie, don't... don't do this.
Are you... are you there?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
If I'm going to die,
I'd like to die in my bed, in my sleep, having told my wife I love her, perhaps re-reading the final chapter of "Moby-Dick."
Unfortunately for you, sir, there is only one way out.
We can commandeer the elevator.
Not possible.
We've been cut off from the power grid, and reserve power does not go to the cargo elevator.
Even if you can get the elevator to work,
Howard will know the second you do.
Well... that's your problem to solve.
I'm worried about getting out alive.
We're almost in.
I'm not convinced that's gonna work.
Mr. Solomon, is it?
Are you familiar with Schrodinger's cat?
Oh, yes.

Cat's sealed in the box with poison, simultaneously alive and dead until you open up the box and observe it.
Exactly.
This is nothing like that.
When they open this box, we're just dead.
They're almost in.

_
It works.

This should give us about 30 seconds' worth of lift.
That'll get us to the next floor.
They're on the move.

They're getting away.

Well, here goes our ride now.
You don't have any bullets.
He doesn't know that.
Hey!

We got company.
Come on.
Please don't shoot.

Come on.
There's nothing we can do, Scottie.

Dr. Whitehall, you are safe now.
That seems to be the only thing you and your wife agree on.
- Speaking of Scottie...

If you'll come with me, sir, there are some people I'd like you to meet.
I want everyone released.
They were trying to kill us.
They were only doing their jobs.
Take everyone into the command center.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Just hold still.

Okay, there.
Keep the pressure on.
You're closer to Scottie than anyone else.
Do you believe what he's saying about her?
Apologies.
Where's Scottie?
I would like to introduce Richard Whitehall.
Where is she?

I don't know, and, yeah, Scottie is unhurt.
I wish everyone was.
I genuinely regret having to resort to such extreme measures.
You can't take the company back by force.
You need our consent.
Agreed.

I did what I thought I had to do in order for you to hear him out.
And I'm very sorry, but it seems like a small price to pay for the truth.
Doctor.
I'll do my best.
To begin with, I am not in business... with Howard Hargrave.
I'm here because I was abducted by Scottie Hargrave.
You all must be very confused.
I know I would be.
To those who stood against me, you did what you were trained to do, defend the company.
To those who stood with me,
I ask you to accept that... we must now all work together.
To those loyal to Scottie,
I'll tell you what I told the board.
I'm only interested in the truth.
She will have her day in court.
But, first, we have to find her.
Anyone who is not comfortable with that mission... may leave now... with my blessings.
Thank you.

Dumont.
Sir.
You knew that they had access to the elevator, and yet, you said nothing.
And that allowed Scottie to escape.
Now you're gonna help us find her.
How did my team access the facility?
You... programmed the servers to overheat, opening the vents.
Which shut down the network.
I want you to get it back up.
Yes, sir.
That's what it looks like, not what it is.
Look, Dr. Whitehall sees it differently.
- I held him for his own good.

- I kept him from Howard.

- Oh, and now you're siding with him?

- Yeah, well, that's only because...

You've got other things to worry about.
I just got the results of an internal investigation launched after Howard's press conference.
There is a string of financial irregularities on your watch, including several off-the-book facilities.
- Who's seen this?

Scottie, I don't know what you've done, and I don't want to know.
Do yourself a favor.
Whatever it is, get ahead of it.
Here's what we owe you.
Let me know how to contact Zeke and Vito's families, and I'll make sure they get their share.
Thanks, man.
Hey, one more thing.
- You're done selling drugs to Nez.

All due respect, playboy, man's got to make a living.
All due respect, Nez is like a daughter to Howard, which means she's like a sister to me.
I think you can see we're pretty generous with those who help.
I'm a lot less generous with those who don't.
You got me?
Where are you?

I'm nowhere close to all right.
But I do have a plan, and I need your help to carry it out.
Yeah, whatever you need.
Is the Artax Network back online?
Dumont's working on it.
I need him to stop.
Okay.

Howard's looking everywhere for me.
I need to get across town without him finding me.
Okay, but then where are you gonna go?
Just tell Dumont.
Is the system online yet?
Working as fast as I can, okay?
Just got to reboot this server.
Wait.
I, uh, talked to Scottie.
She's fine, but she's on the run, doesn't really want us looking for her.
Hargrave wants the network up.
She wants it down.

Did you know about Whitehall?

She's been good to me.
She's been good to me, too.
And I'm not sure what's right or wrong here... online, offline, but I have to decide whether to flip the switch or not.
And before I do, I want to know if she told you about Whitehall.
Is the network up yet?
I got one last problem to solve.
Kat's helping me with it.
With what?
Simple binary choice.
Did she or didn't she?

No.

Okay.

That's the answer I needed.

System's up.
Process every image... satellite,
CCTV, MTA, DMV, Snapchat... everything.
I want to know the second you get a hit.
If we find her, what's gonna happen to her?
Justice.
I loved her once.
In some ways, I still do.
I know how difficult this is, but it's the right thing to do.
I want to thank you for helping me do it.
So, how are we playing this?
The intel Marienthal showed me, for all we know, Howard's seen it.
You think Howard's guys will be here?
I don't know.
So we have to assume the answer is yes.
Well, then, there's only one way to play this.
Let's do it.
Guys, I think I got them.
Where?
A former pharmaceutical plant in Williamsburg.
Corner of Flushing and Spring.
Dumont, call in the FBI.
Bring up any images you have of the area.
We'll meet the FBI there.
- Everybody on the ground.

Come on.

I-I don't understand.

Who else is here?

You know how many, Scottie.

How do you know her name?
I should know her name.

She hired all of us.
- Hey!

Careful.
I am just...
I-I want to show you something.
Work orders for the week, all signed by you.
I've got three months' worth in back.
Purifiers, flame extractors.
This is made up, all of it.
I think you know that it's not made up.
Whitehall prototype.
You want to tell me what's going on here, Scottie?
A frame-up.

And I fell right into it.
Keen, Rowan.

Agents Lamb and Noxon, FBI.

Friends of ours.

What's here?

- We don't know.

- You've never been here before.

And you do not know these guys.
Look at me, Scottie.
If Howard set you up, then the cops will be on their way.
We got to move.
Federal agents!

All right.

Find a different way out.

There are too many.
If I can get to one of the techs,
I'll take one of them as a hostage.
Gun down.
_
Somebody's gonna put their gun down, but it's not gonna be me.
You backed the wrong horse, Nez.
Oh, Matty, I didn't think you believed in right and wrong.
Scottie is the good guy here.
Scottie lied about everything.
She's not who we thought she was.
This place is proof of that.
I hope that the truth comes out in the justice system.
But since I don't intend on letting the justice system deliberate the truth about me, this is where I step off.
The only surviving member of the Pequod.
It's the whaling ship in "Moby-Dick."
Oh, it went down.
Took everyone with it except Ishmael.
And how did he survive?
"Buoyed up by that coffin,
"I floated on a soft and dirge-like main.
"The unharming sharks,
"they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths.
"On the second day, a sail drew near.
"It was the devious-cruising Rachel,
"that in her retracing search after her missing children,
"only found...
"another orphan."
I'll find you.
God, I hope so.
Stop it.

Stop!

Howard's setting me up.
If that's true, then come in.
If you're really innocent, then you have nothing to hide.
I can't.

Well, that sounds like guilty.
Look, I understand why it's hard for you to believe me, but we both know Howard did something incredibly cruel when he sent you to me and didn't allow you to tell me that you're my son,
that after all these years, you're still alive.
That cruelty was also a blessing, because you got to see how I truly feel about my son, that I never stopped loving him.
I never stopped loving you.
If you know how I feel, then you know who I am.
And if you know that, can you honestly tell me... that you believe what Howard says about me?
Today, I can.
Susan Hargrave, you're under arrest for kidnapping and false imprisonment.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
My answer's no.
Usually, we like to get the question out first.
You showed me the NTSB report.
It says the landing gear on Howard's plane was tampered with.
You want to know if I think she did it.
Do you?
Of course she did it.
This an accurate prototype?
Completely.
I can't believe how close she came.
And it could've only been built by someone who had access to my research.
And no one had that other than Scottie Hargrave?
Scottie Hargrave and me.
You were the only ones authorized to make payments from this account.
That's right.
This is a payment schedule from the account.
Everything related to the construction of the prototype,
Mrs. Hargrave denies knowing anything about.
7:29 a.m. on 3/1.
11:45 p.m. on 3/9.
6:15 a.m. on 3:17.
If you're asking me whether I made these payments, the answer is no.
I wasn't even working at these times.
So, if Ms. Carlson didn't make the payments, then it must've been you.
Gotcha.
I'm sorry it ended this way.
Yeah, me too.
What you said before about me being like a sister to you...
I meant it.
Good.
Whatever help you need.
I like what you've done with the place.
How does it feel?
It feels... right... this, being here with you.
You know, my daughter turns... she turns 1 next week.
This isn't the end, you know?
This is just the beginning.
Yeah.
For our family, which I hope...
I want you to be a part of.
And I want you to be a part of this.
I know.
Maybe, someday.
Who knows?
For now, I am going home to my daughter's birthday.
Well, of course you are.

You're coming to the party by the way.
It's a princess theme, so I hope you've got a tiara.
I wouldn't miss it.
You did it, Dad.
We did, son.
Together.
- Tiara?

Hey.

- Cheesecake?

The truth is, I knew you'd come back sooner or later, that it was only a matter of time before you realized what a huge mistake
- it was to dump me.

Explain what?

Payment authorizations.
For the construction of a sophisticated computer prototype.
- What is there to...

- I don't...

Okay, okay.

- What am I looking at?

Made from my computer and dates and times when we were together.
All except one that was made on my phone... after you switched it with yours, after you made it look like it was an innocent mistake.
It was you, wasn't it?
You were working with Howard the whole time.
He used you to get close to her, to get access to her files.
It was you that made it all work.
The frame-up.

Scottie was this guilty...
Couldn't get to her files.

But you... you actually thought I cared.
I'm sorry.
Last thing anyone's ever gonna say to you is,
"This is all your fault."
- Is he here?

Arrived an hour ago.
Now, my flight leaves in two hours.
I should be home for dinner.
Like you said when I left, what could possibly go wrong?
Kat.

What is this?

The truth.
It's him.
Where are we?
We are operational.
