So, today is a big day for the stables.
It's pony camp!
Super exciting.
But it's hard to think about the fun times when a pony has been stolen.
And you kind of got someone wrongly arrested for being a horse thief.
And if I could just go to the stables, I could sort it out... but I'm banned.
- We're going.

Wanna see Gramps have his plaster taken off?
You know, as fun as that sounds...
Didn't think so.
- We'll be back around 4:00.

- Look after Rosie.

What if she's not going to the hospital?
- What if she went to meet with Mia's dad?

- Rosie, you really need to let this go.

In Mom's diary, it said she was in love with somebody who was called "E."
"Elliot" starts with E.
That's your evidence, the alphabet?
I'm still building my case, thank you very much.
- Why are you wearing stinky horse clothes?

If you and I could go and get squished by some crazy horses?
Great sister skills.
I just really need to talk to Pin, okay?
I...

He was stealing and you caught him.

You know what?
- You wouldn't understand.

Raven told me I was wrong.
Raven?
As in, the horse?
Now he's a talking horse?

You know what?

Why don't you come?
Wait.

- My savings.

- She's on the mainland.

Well, then I'll take you straight to the Center for Made-Up Diseases.
- What if I break my leg?

It could happen.
Have I done it right?
Guys?
Um, sorry, Ben, we were too busy assessing the way Marcus' horse approaches the jump.
He is so hot.
Yes, Becky.

I'm not talking about the horse.

Girls are gross, right, Bob?
He's amazing.
Remember, it's all about confidence, in yourself and in your horse.
Marcus.

Maybe he has a point about that.
This place has so much poop, they might as well rename it The Poop Palace.
Give it a chance.

Welcome to the neigh borhood.
Get it? "Neigh"?
Think you're gonna be okay with these guys for a few minutes?
Sure.
I'll just try to stand very still and not touch anything.
Or anyone.
I'm glad you like puns.

Get ready for the mane event, where you'll see the reining champion.
Uh, Zoe, I changed my mind!
Dad, don't.
- I'm just gonna have a word.

Just stay away from that girl.
Don't worry.

Hey.
Firefly was an easy target.
A beautiful horse in a broken stable.
Are you okay?
I'm never gonna see him again.
- It's all your fault.

If it wasn't for you, Firefly would be here.
- But I didn't...

Because of you, no one was watching the stables.
Firefly was alone, and they took him.
Guys, can we keep a lid on all the stolen horse talk?
I need the kids to be leaving here raving about us.
- If they find out we lost a horse...

Yeah, I get it.
Oh.

- He's working.

No wonder you're worried about the reputation of your stables.
This is all my fault.
I shouldn't have called Pin a horse thief.
- I didn't have all the facts.

- Try telling that to Mia.

Okay?
Okay, guys, let's get this camp started.
Everyone meet in the paddock.
- I hope you're pleased with yourself.

What...

I know I hurt Pin, but...
But it's more than that, isn't it?
Hey.
So, I've got a list of people who hate me right now, and...
I'm just making sure you're not on it.
Hey.
Can everyone gather round, please?
Uh, excuse me.

Welcome to Bright Field Stables' first ever pony camp.
- Bright Fields forever!

Thank you, officer.
- Okay...

Totally in love with her.
She has no idea.
And as riding is very hungry work, you'll be very pleased to hear that our barbecue is up and running.
Ooh!
- We're also gonna work...

Ah.

No.
So, impress me.
Okay, campers under 12, come with me and grab a shovel,
- because we have some mucking out to do.

Come on, or there won't be any poo left.
I'm gonna stink until I'm 16.
- Try to have fun.

- Hey.

Here I am.
You gonna start secretly filming me again?
Okay, Marcus, I wasn't filming you.

It's all right.

We...

My mom ended up signing the permission slip anyway.
She used pink pen, and her handwriting was shaky,
- 'cause she just finished her coffee.

- We're glad you're here.

- See you later.

It wouldn't be right.

You still have Fletcher, haven't you?
- I'll help you tack him up.

- You'll ride him one day.

Raven.

I'm just afraid Mia's gonna get rid of him.
Come on, Becky, tell her your theory.
If you impress Sam again today, she might let you ride Raven.
Then you can work out his interpersonal problems,
- and we can all live happily ever after.

Well, believe it or not, she's actually the brains in this outfit.
Hey, Pin!
Hey...
If you would just talk to me for one second.
I just...
Look, don't get me wrong, I feel terrible about Firefly.
Then get CCTV, security fences, a gate that actually locks.
- I just don't have the money.

- Where?

Saddle up.
- We're off, okay?

Please, Elliot.

You don't seem to realize, that horse cost me a lot of money.
What if I took my cash out?

- Well, I'll do everything I can.

Hmm.

I'm watching you, E.
Ew.
Ah, the muck heap.

I've never seen so much poop in my entire life.
It's not even that big at the moment.
After pony camp, it's gonna be twice the size it is now.
Wow, I can't wait to see that.
Ah, me, neither.
I don't get why people like these horrible hairy poo bags so much.
Well, they're powerful, beautiful, and the way they move, there's this kind of freedom...
They may be powerful and beautiful, but they still stink.
Hmm.

Raven, if I could take you out, I would.
- Uh, where are you going?

Won't be gone long.
Are you sure you'll be all right on your own, Rosie?
I'll survive.
Probably.
I know you're not used to horses.
You will be super careful, won't you?
- Do you want me to stay with you?

You stay here and join the little ones in the paddock.
Probably more your level anyway.
Or you could come with us.

As if.

Everyone ready?
- We're waiting for you.

He's with the little kids.

And here I was thinking that stealing and getting arrested were his only talents.
Go.
Make up with, uh, Mr. Cheekbones over there.
- Are you sure?

Thank you.
Uh, don't forget to tell him about your ability to talk to horses.
Hey.

Look, I really am sorry.
It was an idiot move.

And, also, I guess I just think...
I...

Is everything okay?
Are you in trouble?
Pin, whatever it is, let me help you.
What am I supposed to think if you won't talk to me?
- Becky, you're in charge.

- What?

Woo-hoo!
Wait, what?
Wait.
Major, honey, I know we have never cantered before, but now might be a good time to try it.

Pin, get back here!
Wow, this is amazing.
Pin, where did you go?
Can't take a hint, can you?
- What's in there?

Look, I'm not gonna play this game with you again, okay?

What were the sedatives for?
To keep Firefly quiet so I could steal him.
- It's what you think, isn't it?

Tell me you didn't.
Firefly?
He's a moor pony.
- He's lame.

He's the council's responsibility.
But they've no money to treat the wild horses, so... they'd put him down.
You were taking the medicine for him.
Pin, I am so sorry...
Do you know what thieves do to horses?
They drug them.

Sell them to people that don't even like horses, that just wanna own something shiny and expensive and wild.
You thought I could be a part of something like that?
- I'm sorry, I got it wrong.

Until you look beyond what's in front of you,
- you'll keep getting it wrong.

You should go now.
Dad doesn't want me talking to you, and now I know why.
Just go.
You all right?
She won't be bothering us again.
Beyond those hills is the old barn.
Which, by the way, is totally haunted.
That barn is about as haunted as my saddle pad.
Hundreds of years ago, a greedy lord heard of the great treasure hidden in the hills.
And which lord?

I mean, this story needs facts.
Jade, you're interrupting my story.
He rode out in search of the treasure, and then a huge storm came in.
But the lord pushed on, desperate to find the loot.
And then he froze to death.
Now the ghost pony wanders the moors.
And until she's reunited with her master, she'll claim our souls, one by one.
Grow up, Becky.
So... come on.
Why is Zoe chasing Pin?
Something else she wants to wrongly accuse him of?
I'll let you in on a secret.
Please do.
Zoe is absolutely petrified of the Ghost Pony.
She got spooked.

Fine, don't tell me.

Come on, Susie, this is boring.
Susie?
Sorry.

It's such a beautiful day, and you've hardly taken your eyes off your phone.
Come on, give it over.
I'm not giving you my phone.
Susie, remember our no boys pact?
If one of us is single, then...
Then we both are.
It's not like anyone texts you anyway.
I'm kidding.
Come on, everyone.

"Bail." Like "hay bale."
Wait!

- I guess we should head back, too.

I was given a job, and I'm going to get that job done.
Come on, Bob.

Becky, it's this way.
I knew that.
See, it's all about concealing the flaws.
With a sparkly scrunchy, we're taking attention away from his snaggletooth.
- Wow.

- And not just for the horse.

No problem.

Ah.

I know, right?
It's amazing what a little LA style can do to a matted, neglected mane.
You know, I really thought you'd be long gone by now.
Well, someone told me that horses are beautiful, and maybe they were right.
Okay, you need to comb the tail, not tickle it.
Here.
Pony makeovers.

- Thanks.

This old thing needs all the help he can get.
No offense.
Sure.

So, your dad...

I mean Elliot.
- Does he know my mom at all?

Look, let's talk Zoe.
Everyone says she's this amazing rider.
I know.

Anyway, your dad... is he, you know, seeing anyone?
Seeing anyone?

But, um, Zoe, she's had lots of riding lessons back home, right?
No, not one.

She really is a natural rider.
Good for her.
Yeah.

- Not even allowed to what?

Rosie...

I thought we were close, like sisters.
Okay, fine.

Like, at all.

Zoe's not allowed to ride?
That's so sad.
Hey, Zoe!

Where have you been?
- Becky got us lost.

I just decided, in my role as hack leader, to take a little detour, that's all.
- How did it go with Pin?

That I'm an idiot.
He's been taking the sedatives to treat an injured moor pony.
He was still stealing.

Yeah, but instead of watching him,
I should've been watching the real thieves.
You thought you were doing the right thing.
Tell that to Firefly.
Don't let this ruin your day.
Let's head back to pony camp.

You're right, you're right.
- I am so hungry that I could eat a horse.

Oh.

Hey, wait for us.
Whee!
They're back.
Is that Zoe?
- This doesn't look good.

Mom.
- Mrs. Phillips, is there a problem?

- Yes, there is.

I'm good.

I asked you not to come here.

You promised.
I said...

I'm her mother.

- Rosie's clearly been so frightened...

She's right, Mom.
Rosie's been doing great.

- Why did someone call me to come get her?

I rang her before you told me, I swear.
I would never drop Zoe in it.
It's just...

It's okay.

- You're never coming back here.

- I think you're overreacting.

One foot in this place, I'm shipping you back to the States.
You understand?

Yes, I understand.
Rosie, get over here.
We're leaving.
- You sure you're all right?

So, when you got home, on a scale of one to hangry T. Rex, how mad did your Mom get?
I think she might talk to me again when I'm 18.
- I can't believe Mia called her.

She blames me for Firefly.
She's the one that put Firefly in a stable with a broken door.
Yeah.

I mean, Firefly was right there in a broken stable.
The thieves didn't really need to try.
What if they didn't take Firefly because the door was broken?
What if they took him
- because they thought he was Raven?

Sometimes you need to look beyond what's in front of you.
Firefly wasn't just in a broken stable.

The thieves took the wrong horse.
And when they realize their mistake... they'll come back for him.
