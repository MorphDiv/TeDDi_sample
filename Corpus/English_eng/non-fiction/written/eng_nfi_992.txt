"Dearest Alan",
"if I don't hear from you, I don't know what I'll do."
She loves him.
But does he love her?
I'm Kate, by the way.
Viv.
Three, two, one.
- Go.

Here you are, Mrs Ranovic.
Thank you.
- You seem troubled, Frances.

It weighs on me sometimes.
- Lives are in your hands.

They are.
We're gonna need a bigger car seat, anyway.
How about a family wagon?
What do you think?
Two godmothers reporting for duty.
May your days be full of sunshine.

Hi.

Yes, I've heard all about you.
So, where did you two tell Matron you were off to?
Dentist.
I should go back.

No, no, no, it's just about to start.
I don't wanna lose my job, Viv.
We're expecting 4,000.
That's what happens when you ban your staff from marching for their rights.
You have to stay.
This is something Laura will be able to tell her kids about, that she was here.
A bra-burner while still in the pram.

Do you think you need liberating?
- I don't know much about this.

I'd rather be under the thumb.
I believe a woman's place is in the home.
Together united, we'll never be defeated.

Together united, we'll never be defeated.
Together united, we'll never be defeated.
And what does women's liberation mean to you?
Equal pay, equal say and control over my own body.
Why are you here today?
I'm sick of men telling me what to do.
And I have a brain and I can think for myself.
Out of the kitchen and into the world.
Women's rights now.

- God, I'm starving.

- Where'd you get that?

And this is about as close as I could get to a Chiko Roll, so...
What I want is a bakala.
Dry, salty fish.
Speaking of dried-up old fish.
Morning tea's not for another hour.
Sorry, I'll try and schedule my cravings outside work hours.
You can all finish up.

Your father's on the phone.
Hello?
You're a bad, bad girl, Debbie Hampshire.
Alan.
My God.

- You got my letter?

- You're not angry?

- I'm dying to see you too.

Mm-hm.

1:30 today at our special place.
- What, today?

Okay.

I'll ask.
- Excuse me, Matron?

My gran isn't very well and my dad thinks she'd really perk up if I went to visit.
I know it's against the rules and everything but do you think it would be okay just this once?
You know, she is 90.
You can talk to my Dad if you like.
Just tell him to have you back by 3:00.
She says yes.
See you then.
Thanks, Matron.
You know, you're really not as mean as you look.
Patty would've loved this.
You think it's okay?
To breastfeed on International Women's Day?
I think you're okay.
Together united, we'll never be defeated.
Together united, we'll never be defeated.
Together united...
Oh!

Together united, we'll never be defeated.
- Join in.

What, are you afraid your husband's gonna see you?
No, it's not him I'm worried about.

Together united, we'll never be defeated.
The police are keeping a close eye on any troublemakers as the marchers turn...
Why do women want equal pay?

You want straight hair or not?
Seeking a reaction from members of Parliament.
Alan says if everyone got paid the same it would ruin the economy.
How?

Okay, thank you, miss financial expert.
Are you an economist?

Anyway, Alan's going to take care of me.
You know, he'll be partner in Daddy's firm by the time he's 30.
He already takes home $100 a week.
- He sounds dreamy.

Why aren't you keeping the baby?
Well, you can't take a baby to Paris.
Obviously.
I cannot believe he's taking you to Paris.
Paris.

Daddy's firm has offices all over the world.
Anyways, enough yakking.

Thank you.
I, uh...

25 years long service.
Father Ross says they're naming a part of the hospital after you.
The conference room.
The maternity wards were already named after men.
Ah.

Not on hospital time, no.
Isn't that your democratic right?
Well, what about a patient's right to adequate healthcare?
Protests don't achieve anything.
You want equal pay, put your head down and work for it.
I'm going to need more backup with Mrs Carrington.
I'll see what I can do.
Quite a few of the nurses have called in sick.
Must be something going around.
I look fat in this one.
- Maybe this one?

Working on your speech?
Is it that obvious?
I don't know why you need me to say anything.
Because this whole event is in your honour.
Stop being so modest.

"I always had a calling to help others.
At the tender age of..."
- This is silly.

Your career's something to be proud of.
I don't know about that.
I'll introduce you.
Is there anything you'd like me to include?
Career highlights?
Juicy scandals?
Now you're being ridiculous.
- I leave those to the doctors.

Is it serious with this fellow?
I don't know.
We're in love, so how serious is that?
I think he might actually propose today.
You know, he's a crazy romantic like that.
Final touch.
Where did that come from?
Nicked it from my Mum's jewellery box.
What?

Okay.
How do I look?
Like a pregnant schoolgirl.
But pretty.
A lot down with the bug, Matron.
And four dental emergencies.
- How's your wife's?

That filling came loose and kept her up all...
She said it was a root canal.
Oh, that's right.
It is.

A lot of pain in her teeth.
Well, let's hope she makes a speedy recovery and gets back to work as soon as possible.
Oh, yeah, I'm sure she'll be right.
- Smooth as silk.

- How do you like Kate?

- Oh, she's so...

Liberated.
Back in the kitchen, bitch.
- Did you say something?

- Definitely a dyke.

Is that all you can think of to say?
Viv, walk away.

Shouldn't you be at home where you belong?
- Yeah, barefoot and pregnant.

Is that all you think we're good for, hey?
Well, you said it.

- What did you call me?

Hey!

- Back off, you crazy bitch!

You crazy dickhead!
Idiot!
Keep walking, morons.
You're the reason why we're marching here today!
Martha, stop it.

- What's wrong?

Oh, it's a hot day.
Oh, no.

I don't think that's it.
Sorry, hon, I've gotta go.

- Who's Phil?

- You're married?

You can be married and liberated.
Bye.

Oh, she's running a temp.
It could be an infection.

- Maybe it's a tummy bug.

Maybe it's me.
That's just mother's guilt talking.
That's far enough.
Perhaps you didn't get the memo banning hospital staff from attending the protest.
Or do you deny going to the march?
We were fighting for our rights.

You've already been giving a warning after flaunting yourself naked in public.
You're fired.
Effective immediately.
Get out.
- I am staying.

As Joan's friend.

That shouldn't be a problem, should it?
Don't even start on the dental story.
Consider this an official warning.
Your pay will be docked accordingly.
- Now get back to work.

Dr Patterson.
- Okay.

Let's take a listen.
Her chest is congested.
But?
While she's here, we should have the head of paediatrics take a look at her.
Take some chest X-rays.

- Hey?

- Come on.

- Alan, I've missed you so...

What are you playing at putting letters in my mailbox?
What if my wife found it?
You ever think what that would do to me?
- You pull this shit again, I swear...

Yeah, if she found out.

It'd save you from having to tell her.
Maybe this all should just come out into the open now.
Not yet.

I'm sorry.

I'm so exhausted looking after Barbara.
- I know.

I'm just trying to do the right thing.
Make it so no one gets hurt.
Yeah, but she has to know sometime.

I mean, that's if you still want to be with me.
Hey, believe me, I do.
Let me handle things my way.
I'm crazy about you, kid.
I can't stop thinking about our life together.
You and me.

Lying in each other's arms.
You mean it, don't you?
Do I look like I'm joking?
You're the funny one.
I should have stood up to Matron.
What's so wrong with marching for our rights?
- Mmm.

I mean, I'm clerical, not nursing.
Simon?
Hmm?

Everything okay?
Absolutely tiptop.
Just tying up some loose ends.
Whoa.
- They're moving.

What are they?

Motile haploid cells.
Spermatozoa.
- Swimmers.

Yeah, I was just checking everything was all right in the downstairs department, you know, 'cause we've been having so much trouble getting pregnant.
How did you get the sample?
Oh, just the, uh... standard extraction method.
Don't worry.

- Like Vikings.

How 'bout we just not worry about it and float for a while.
Oh, floating's not very Viking.
I really need to get back to work.
Love you.
Love you.
- What's wrong?

I thought you were trying to start a family.
Simon's trying to start a family.
He doesn't know?
What do I do?
Now he thinks there's something wrong.
He's testing his sperm.
So, tell him the truth.
- He won't understand, Viv.

You want to take your time before you start having kids.
He'll get that.
What if I don't want to have kids?
Course you do.
Don't you?
I don't know.
I don't want to lose my job.
Unremitting fever, some increased work of breathing and mottling here on the upper body.
Where?

You said she was off her feeding?
You think it's related?
Chest X-rays.
Thanks.
- Mmm.

Pneumonia.
My guess is a virus.
There is a nasty strain doing the rounds.
- How could I have missed that?

No, Viv's right.
It's lucky you picked it up when you did.
Let's see what Dr Roberts thinks.
In the meantime, I would recommend some oxygen to help her breathing and a course of BENPEN to knock out any secondary infection.
Okay.
Sorry, Joan.
You no longer work here.
Someone on staff has to do it.
Frances.
I just heard about Dr Millar's daughter.
Nothing serious, I hope.
Yes, let's hope.
If you're still worried about your speech,
I'm happy to sing your praises, if you prefer.
Maybe I'd prefer you not to talk about me at all.
- It's a lot of fuss.

Something happened that...
How do I explain it?
Shall we?
In all my years of service,
I've prided myself on never making a mistake.
Minor one here or there, but... nothing that affected a life... impacted someone, so...
If you need to talk further, Frances... the door to the confessional is always open.
We're of different religious persuasions, Father.
I don't confess.
I'm sure you'd find it helpful.
And anything you tell me is sacred and confidential.
I'm just a conduit between you and God.
Thanks for being so understanding, kiddo... you're the best.
God, I can't wait till we can be together for real.
Me too.
- When?

I've gotta make sure things go smoothly with Barbara so we can afford a nice lifestyle.
I could work.
Or study French and fashion.
That's more you.
We need to keep this under wraps until I'm divorced and you're... back to yourself.
Then it can be the two of us.
- In France?

We'll do it all.
We'll walk along the Seine and wear matching berets and eat baguettes.
Spud craving?
Gnocchi craving.

Comfort food.

Debbie should be back by now.
She's taking a big risk.
If Matron finds out she's with Alan...
I hope he's worth it.
Whoever he is.
He sounds sophisticated.
How can you eat this?
Cures my salt cravings.
Try some.
It can't be worse than dried fish.
Not bad.
You normally just have a little bit.

- Okay, that's too much.

Her breathing's more settled.
But we'll need to keep her under observation a while longer.
Come on.
- How is she?

Emergency chocolate.

Maybe she's allergic to me.
We'd have seen evidence of that by now.
Diarrhoea, vomiting, rashes.
Nurse Maguire... go and get your uniform on.
Yes, Matron.
This has been fun, baby, but I better get you back.
I reckon you've been at your gran's long enough.
- Do we really have to go?

I've gotta pick up Barbara from the specialist's.
You're cute when you're jealous.
Hey, you have nothing to worry about.
You get me in a way she never will.
Just so we're clear... no more letters or phone calls, yeah?
Once you've dealt with the kid situation, I'll come find you.
You promise you'll write to me, though?
Sure.

Close your eyes.
- How is she?

I can't imagine what it must be like for Joan.
Touch wood our babies are healthy.
Simon, there's something I have to talk to you about.
But it can't be here.

Hello there, little one.
- Oh, no.

I don't know.

- Laura?

Get Dr Patterson.

Yep.
No, no, no, let me do this.
Hey, hey, hey, Joan.
Her respiratory effort is getting worse.
She is cyanosed and unresponsive.
- Sedative.

- We have to sedate her.

Joan.

It is the only way we can intubate and adequately ventilate her lungs.
- Okay.

Nurse.
Hey.
You.
You're gonna have a little sleep and Mummy...
We need an oxygen machine.
- I thought she was improving.

There is some underlying condition.
Trust me, ladies, there's nothing like an older man.
They know how to treat a woman.
- And Paris.

We'll go dancing at the Moulin Rouge and buy shoes at the Champs-Élysées.
You put that out this instant.
Are you disobeying me?
It's a free country.
Put it out and get back to work.
You know... if the hospital knew how badly you treated us, they wouldn't even name a toilet block after you.
Brief the theatre staff now.
We'll have to operate on Laura.
We need to get Joan to consent.
Where's he going?
To brief the theatre staff.
Why?
Talk to me.
What did the ECG show?
It is possible that she has a heart defect that is leaking blood back into her lungs.
No.

If the hole is large enough, Joan, you don't hear a thing.
How large is it?
We won't know until we operate.
Look, her prognosis is good.

No.

We've gotta intervene, Joan, and we need to do it as soon...
No!

You're wrong.
Joan.
I'll let you think about it.
Matron.
- I owe you an apology.

I should have baptised Laura when you asked.
If you're up for it, we could do it now.
It should only take a minute.
No, I know why you're here.
You... you think she's going to die.
I want to save her, Joan.
So she can meet God, with a soul free from the stain of original sin.
You can save her when she's better.
Now please leave us alone.
Sorry.
Has anyone contacted the baby's father?
No one knows where he is.
- How dare you do that to me?

I called Father Ross.
Just in case.
Joan.
I'm sorry.
We don't know if she'll pull through.
No.

You're wrong.
All of you are wrong.
My daughter... is not going to die.
What you said about a confession... was it between you and me?
- Correct.

Shall we?
Dr Millar's baby...
Laura?

I think maybe it's not her baby.
I think I... accidentally swapped her for a girl born five minutes before Laura.
- How can you be sure?

I was run off my feet.

What should I do?
Speaking as a board member...
I'd advise you to think very carefully about what you do next.
If you make this public and it's found a mistake has been made...
I can't protect you from the consequences.
And as a priest?
Then I think you should listen to your conscience.
She's so peaceful.
I can't believe she's fighting for her life.
She's stabilising.
Joan, if we're going to operate, it has to be now.
Okay.
- We heard about your daughter.

Eventually.

We're about to move her into the theatre.
Oh.
We thought you might want this.
In case you forgot to eat.
Gnocchi.
- I can take that.

And this.
Lavender.
Put it under your pillow and you'll have sweet dreams.
- Joan.

- What's happened?

- How?

You tell theatre to hold off.
No, no, she's going into surgery.

- She can't like this.

Bowditch, you get another line into her.

Get some inotropes now.
Laura, Mummy's here.

Stay with us, Laura.

Bowditch, how's that line going?
Nurse?

BP's dropping.

- She's going into multi-organ failure.

- Come on, bub, hang in there.

They're tremors.

They're waiting for her in the theatre.
- Okay.

No, we don't have time to wait.

- I give my consent.

- She won't survive it.

I know that this is hard for you but think what you would recommend in this situation if you weren't the mother.
But I am her mother.
My... my daughter is dying.
I told her it was just gonna be a little sleep.
I'm sorry, Joan.
There is nothing more we can do.
Let's get this... get these things off her.

Together united, we'll never be defeated.
Thousands of women marched down William Street today...
Is now a good time?
In celebration of...
We're on our own.
Earlier, there was something you wanted to talk about in private.
It doesn't matter.

Marchers carrying placards...
And here she is now.
Not only the woman of the hour, the woman of the past 25 years:
Matron Frances Bolton.
You good?
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the King's Cross General Board,
I dedicate this state-of-the-art conference room to Matron Frances Bolton.
- Dr. Miller.

It's too soon, she's not ready.
When it's all falling apart...
You promise you won't go anywhere.
Love will bring them together.
Everyday, I've thought of you.

Next Tuesday.
The temptation.
The betrayal.
How could you keep that a secret from me?
Married the wrong woman!
The Love Child that will seduce Australia.
Oh my god.
New Love Child, next Tuesday after Britain's Got Talent, on Nine.
