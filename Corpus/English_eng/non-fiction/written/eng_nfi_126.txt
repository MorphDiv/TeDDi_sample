One of the biggest assets that we've ever had.
I need to know if I can trust you.
Sharpshooter miri was recently arrested for shooting soldiers.
Did the frommer boy chicken out?
You can tell your father.
Don't forget your papers!
Is it set?
She's not in the restaurant, and the concierge.
Hasn't seen her leave.
I don't think she wants him killed,
But I don't think she thinks ahead.
You're sure about this?
You're absolutely sure you want to leave him?
Sabine, you have a very special responsibility.
You know what your country.
Children, kitchen, church.
And a husband needs a wife by his side.
Papa, please, listen to me.
There is nothing worse.
For a couple than to lose a child,
But you must be strong and not always.
I have to leave him and come back home.
What's not that simple?
If you knew why, you'd understand.
I have to make a phone call,
But would it be all right if we talked a bit later?
Yes, if you're not too busy.
Everyone will be there, so be sure.
The entire nazi machine, everything...
If we cripple the supply, it makes the war smaller.
I need to be back.
The location of the refineries is highly classified.
Your father-in-law is one of the few people who knows.
What's your relationship with him?
He knows I only joined the ss because,
As his future son in-law, there was no other choice.
If he heard you were a traitor...
Sometimes, I think he'd insist on leading.
The firing squad personally.
I've got her.
Hello, sabine.
We need to talk.
I'll talk, but don't you dare touch me.
She must be inside that church.
Let's go around the back, see if there's another way in.
Even if we get past the guards,
Even if we do get her out of there, how far do you think we'll get without a vehicle?
The guards won't need theirs if they're dead.
They have automatic weapons.
Yeah, but only if we have a solid plan.
This is a place of god, and I have a service to do.
Take your business somewhere else!
Go away.
If we can't get inside, maybe there's someone who can.
Why don't we sit down?
In case you told your father anything that might.
Put us at risk.
Did you?
Did I tell my father about the spies.
Who pretend to be my friends, who come to my home,
And follow me in the streets?
Not yet.
That's good.
Last week, we were planning to run away to spain.
After he chased you out of my house,
Maybe we had a chance to leave all this business behind.
He comes home, "sabine, I've just met.
But he thought it would be...
He thought it would be safer for you not to know.
He was trying to protect you.
And that's why we need your help.
Franz, he needs your help.
And you can tell him I won't come to his party either!
Everyone will be there.
My father wants me to look pretty.
Listen, I don't want to tell you what to do...
I'm done with franz and just because I haven't told.
My father doesn't mean I won't.
You know he's gonna get shot, that's the law!
My goodness!
Sabine had no idea.
She knows her husband is working with the allies,
For now.
This technically makes her a traitor too.
Let's hope we don't need to use it.
Sabine says that everyone will be there, including her father.
And I presume she's not going to be there.
But all the top brass are.
We may not get a chance like this again.
We were thinking that we could mingle, listen.
Plant some false intel.
What are you thinking?
Does helene bauer know how to dance?
Of course she does.
If sabine decided to talk,
You could be walking into a trap.
If the party's on, she hasn't talked.
Make schmidt your priority.
Did she say if she's coming home?
Only that she won't be attending.
Your celebration tonight.
I need you to put.
Helene bauer.
And sturmbannfuhrer karl reimann.
It is in your interest.
That I maintain credibility with my superiors?
Has not reported in since the failed operation.
But if he has been captured.
And is in your custody, it would reflect poorly on me.
I know you would never release him.
Tonight, your agents.
Can listen and observe from a discreet distance.
I will make introductions of my choosing.
Understood.
Good luck with the call.
Excuse me, father.
Can I help you?
The people they're holding inside the church...
Bread for the prisoners.
Bread for the prisoners.
Thank you.
Thank you, father.
Are you the "girl from the moon"?
I assume you acquired your job at the royal care society.
We're already questioning your swastika club associate.
But you also have some sophisticated colleagues.
Who provided you with the compact explosive.
You gave klaus?
The sooner you answer my questions, the sooner.
You get some circulation back in your arms.
They must have run out.
Of manpower to promote you to sergeant.
If you were better at your job, you wouldn't be here.
I'm impressed klaus frommer was able to get the bomb.
You seem to care a lot about a german you killed.
He was your first, wasn't he?
And they sent you in to talk to me.
Bad strategy to send an emotional officer.
I didn't want to have to do this.
You ok?
I'm ok.
Good luck.
Frau helene bauer.
And sturmbannfuhrer karl reimann.
My warmest congratulations, franz.
Thank you for including us,
Herr brigadefuhrer.
I'm delighted you both could make it.
I thought jacques rigaud was still in exile in london with general de gaulle.
Two sources confirmed he has landed on the coast.
He's been making his way toward paris,
I'm giving him.
A short break to think about life.
And long enough.
It's a long time coming.
In berlin, the fuhrer built us an autobahn.
The narrow streets are positively medieval.
I hear the panzers have joined the 6th army in stalingrad.
I wonder what route they will take to come back.
Do you think they will come back through france?
More likely norway.
I was recently in oslo.
Our informants report increased.
Allied activity in the north sea.
So it went well?
The telephone call with the fuhrer went well.
Who is that woman?
Franz.
Are you enjoying the party?
I would if my daughter were on your arm where she belongs.
There was something on her mind.
Is there anything I should know?
I can't imagine.
She's always been a happy girl,
But ever since she moved to paris she's become melancholy.
All the more reason to keep her in good spirits.
This is something I trusted you with.
An affectionate disposition;
She's ready to love another child.
A healthy child.
It would be good for both of you.
Have you asked her what she thinks about that?
At this moment, your name escapes me, but I could have sworn that we have met before.
I'm sure I would have remembered that.
Something to do with a colour.
I was hoping I'd see you here.
Excuse us.
I'm sorry, do I know you?
I saw oster circling you and thought it.
He smiles like a bachelor, but he has a wife back home.
I've heard so much about you.
She loves you very much.
But I'm sure there's a good reason.
I was so pleased when she said you'd be here tonight.
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
She told me that you, you wept for joy.
When you heard that paris was spared from the bombings,
And I felt the same way.
This city is like a precious jewel.
I think so too.
It's the only city in europe.
That feels enchanted.
"Enchanted."
It's a perfect word.
"Enchanted." she did say you have the soul of a poet.
She said that?
I can't imagine you're here alone.
I'm sorry to hear it.
My condolences.
It's not a happy club.
We're in, is it?
Especially on evenings like this.
My husband was a very good dancer.
I'm sure I'm a bad substitute,
But, the honour would be mine.
You're a very good dancer.
My elsa would have disagreed with you.
And she would have been wrong.!
Our only chance is when they take the prisoners back to the truck, when they're exposed.
I've only got eight rounds.
Enough to get each of them twice.
But there's something else you should know.
Reinforcements.
They're taking them to the square.
Over there!
What were you doing with schmidt?
You were to stay on the sidelines.
If this is to continue, you're going to follow my lead.
Then stop stepping on my toes.
Well...
You already have a date.
Sweetheart, have you been drinking?
Sabine.
Let me.
Combination.
1, 9, 1, 2, 9, 1, 4, 5.
Six numbers. 5, 1, 2, 1, 9, 1.
8, 5, 9, 1, 2.
How is your headache?
It went away, but now it's back.
Listen, before you do anything you might regret...
From your father.
We worked together in poland, in the same building.
Needs to see the city of lights at least once,
So he arranged me an invitation.
We'll drink to the brigadefuhrer.
But since I'm working in poland, I learned to love it.
What kind of work do you do there?
The kind that gets me invited to parties like this.
You didn't like vodka.
Maybe I like it now.
Pi. 3, 1, 4, 5, 1, 9.
Fibonacci. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.
Euler's. 2, 7, 1, 8, 2, 8.
"Marigold."
Argh!
I want u-boat locations in the north sea.
Because it's been so effective.
The one who's supposed to crack, not you.
The u-boat pens,
Where are they?
I. Don't.
One syllable.
Stavanger?
Are you sure?
We're done here.
It's really quite liberating.
Sabine.
Come here.
Now, you're ready to talk.
I needed to think about things.
It reflects poorly on your marriage.
You know better.
Than to air your dirty laundry in public.
Are you ready for your speech?
Ladies and gentlemen,
May I have your attention please.
I would like to introduce you to our guest of honour,
Herr brigadefuhrer franz
Faber.
And his beautiful wife, sabine.
Thank you very much.
While it is a profound honour.
To be entrusted with this position,
I'm struggling every day.
Am I worthy?
Am I worthy of any of my life's blessings?
And I realize,
No, I'm not.
I'm not yet.
But
I have faith that, with the love that I feel.
For germany,
I will come to understand better every day.
What my true duty is.
My true duty is to know what is right.
And what's wrong, and to follow.
What's right no matter what the cost.
Because every choice that we make.
Shapes the future.
For our families and for ourselves.
We have taken strides toward victory.
We have also known loss.
So,
For the sake of all the souls watching us right now,
Watching.
Every choice that we make,
Let us make them proud,
Let us show them honour.
And love, and do what is right.
I want to make a toast.
To my husband.
Franz,
I never thought you'd become the man you are today.
I hope we can all find a way to live by your words.
To the future!
Sieg...
Heil!
Citizens of caillefaux, I expect.
Your full attention.
You are all to proceed.
To the town square for an important announcement.
Attendance is mandatory.
Move, move, move!
Everyone, move.
Into the square, now!
Move, move, move!
Move now!
Jacques rigaud,
We know you are here.
If you truly are who you say you are,
Don't hide like a coward.
You will not be harmed if you come forward right now.
Reveal yourself.
Gentlemen, anything to share?
Rigaud, we know you're listening.
We will execute these prisoners.
One by one until you step forward.
This is what comes.
Of aiding enemies of the reich.
If any of you interfere, you will be shot.
The sooner someone identifies rigaud,
The more lives will be spared.
No one?
Does anyone have anything to say?
Stay quiet.
There's a car waiting for you at the gates.
You have friends on the outside that want to help you.
Where are you taking him?
Sergeant breeland wants him.
Wants him where?
I said, "wants him where?"
She never said anything about a transfer.
Stop right there!
Stop him!
Hey!
Get back in the room!
Rigaud?
Reveal yourself!
Who will help me save their lives?
No one.
No.
Please, rigaud.
Save these people.
Come on, you know what they're gonna do to you.
Think about it.
Does anyone have anything to say?
One word.
And the young lady lives.
Silence!
I said, "silence!"
Stop looking.
I can't let them keep dying for me.
It's you.
You're gonna give them exactly what they want.
And our friend, she's gonna have died for nothing.
Rigaud, identify yourself.
My friend and I,
France needs you right now.
What about them?
We both know they won't be spared anyways.
Thank you.
Franz, I've heard good news.
Your agent in canada is alive.
To radio intelligence about potential allied landings in norway.
To make a recommendation to berlin to consider.
Fortifying our ports along the north sea.
It was an inspiring speech, franz.
It's been a privilege serving with you.
Yes.
I thought I might stay here with my father tonight.
We have a lot to catch up on.
Please come home with me.
Everything I do, every decision I make.
Is for you, for us.
Then maybe it's time you start including me in those decisions.
I promise.
They're planning to occupy all of france now.
Soon.
All the remaining french authorities.
Will be replaced by germans.
Just when the resistance is turning against itself.
Communists, students, catholics;
None of them can agree on a course of action.
We could all use a sign of hope right about now.
Come on.
They're blanks.
From the interrogation.
A man with his training, he might have noticed a tail.
But he was in a hurry to get here.
That the allies are preparing an invasion through norway.
Keeps the focus off north africa.
It helps when you let them underestimate you.
We have a promise.
An honourable death.
Do you pray?
No.
They're facing a crisis.
German oil supply is draining fast.
They're predicting they'll be immobilized by spring.
So they're actually vulnerable.
Except,
A surge in oil production in march?
It's part of a highly classified project.
And there's nothing in there about where?
Yeah, we do have a new asset.
Microfilm the transcripts.
I'll get the negatives back to camp.
Yeah.
You and alfred.
Did good work.
Thank you, sir.
I'm gonna trust your judgment.
On how to deal with him.
Make you all vulnerable.
Of contacts we need to get in touch with as soon as we can.
Thank you for sheltering me.
Explain.
Jacques rigaud,
Special envoy from general de gaulle.
This is lieutenant colonel duncan sinclair.
Special operations said you'd be back.
So when it's time for the next landing,
We're ready for the fight.
Thank his friend.
Let's get to work then.
