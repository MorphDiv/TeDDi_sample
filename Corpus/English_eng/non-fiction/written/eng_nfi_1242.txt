Nick told me to talk to geo.
I'm geo.

Seven hundred.
Gotta get a lot more, though.
A lot more meaning...
A lot more.
Do I talk to you or someone else?
No, just me.
Why do you ask?
Just want some for the girls, you know?
No, not really.
Explain.
Just wanted some for the girls.
Well, forget it.

For now.
For now.
Police!

Hold it!
You're under arrest!

Hands!

Nice job, Kate.
You know I'm really gonna miss your cooking.
It's just my cooking you're gonna miss?
And you of course.
- Here, sweetie.

Hey, hey.

- Seriously?

Okay.

Thanks, mom.
You know, I'm really proud of you for doing something generous with your summer.
Most kids would be off partying at an all-inclusive resort.
Yeah, well, I'm not most kids.
- Neither is drew.

But can I just have one paranoid mom/detective moment?
Lay it on me.
I need you to promise me that you're gonna be extremely careful when you're down there.
I know how smart you are, but you and I both know that Belize has its problems.
I know.
And you have my word that I'll be careful.
Besides, I'll be with drew the whole time.

He's been with the orphanage for over a year now, so.
It's all good.
Okay.

It's really good.
I love you, honey.
Love you too, mom.
I'll be okay!
Okay.
Let's dig in.
Do you have that neck pillow i got you for the plane?
Yeah, and I'm forwarding you the details of our hostels and travel itinerary as we speak.
What can I say, I raised an organized daughter.
One second.

I'm good!

I can't wait to see you either.

No!

Yes, I'm sure.

- Hey, let me talk to him.

Hey, drew!
I'm fine, thank you.
I just want to tell you again that I need you guys to call me right away if you have any issues.
Good.
No time is too late, no problem too small.

Yeah, I... think he gets it, mom.
- Take care of her.

I love you, too, drew.

You have a great time, okay?
Thanks, mom.

I'm so proud of you.
I feel like a broken record.
I never got a chance to do anything like this when I was your age.
I know and you know what?

Video chat everyday.
Everyday at 5:00 P.M. your time and I'll be one hour behind.
And lots of social media pictures so I can live vicariously.
Got it.
I love you, mom.
I love you, too.
Good night, buddy.
Come in.
You wanted to see me, captain?
Yes.
I wanted to congratulate you on your work out in the field last night.
Thank you, sir.
I know we've been getting higher and higher up the food chain with these guys.
I think we're close to the source now.
Thanks to you and marsden.
That's good, captain.
Marsden is a great detective.
I feel we're close, too.
I hope so.
Thanks, detective.

Sir, have you given anymore thought to who's gonna replace marsden as head of the narcotics division when he leaves?
Go back to work, detective.
Yes, sir.
This is captain.
Okay, send him in.
All right, guys, come on!

Oh!

Oh!
All right!

Babe!
Drew!
Oh, gosh!

- I can't believe I'm finally here.

- God, it's so good to see you.

- Here, let's take a selfie.

June!

- Hey, Nina!

It is so good to finally meet you.
It's good to meet you, too.
Oh, you have such a good man here.
And the kids love him so much!
Kids, kids!

Hi!
Nina.

Hello, Nina!
I see you've got a few fans here.
We're gonna head out.

Oh, okay then.

And be safe, okay?
- Thanks, June.

- Bye!

Bye!
Bye!
We're making a pit stop.
Why?

This place is unlike anything you've ever seen before.
Let's go.
Where are we going?
You'll see.

Gosh, there's so many stairs.

What is this?
- You'll see.

Never get tired of this.
Oh!
And we can just jump in?
Yeah.

Yeah, let's go!
All right.
Gosh.
Ahh.
Whoo!
To say it's been an eye opener is an understatement, honestly.
Yeah, he's been at the orphanage for four years now.
Yeah.

- You'll see.

I can't wait to get started, guys.
Most of them have lost or have been abandoned by their families and have got nothing in comparison to the kids back home.
But they are so happy all the time.
Grateful for all the cultural riches, you know?
There's a lot to say for that.
I feel like I've changed just being here.
I guess that's what happens when you're in a place that's just so different from everywhere else.
We focus so much on material wealth back home.
True.

Honestly, I think it should be mandatory for every privileged person to spend at least a month in a third world or a developing nation.
Just to get perspective.

Yeah, I get that.
Hey, why not just stay longer than just this summer?
Oh, yeah, I wish.
I start college as soon as I get home.
Well, there's no reason you couldn't if you really wanted to.
College can wait.
Yeah, we can use all the help we can get in this orphanage.
There's enough room for you.
We'll see.

I just got here though, so let's slow down a little bit.
Yeah, true.

All right, cheers!
Hi, mom.
Hi, honey.

Oh, I'm great!
We're at this incredible hostel in the south of the country and it's so cool.
It's a super chill atmosphere.
We're staying here for a few days before i start at the orphanage.
That sounds so perfect.
Are you on a hammock?
Yeah, this is the life.

I miss you.

I miss you, too.
Oh, my god.
What?
Okay, so, there's this total creeper here and it's actually really funny.
I think he has a crush on me.
- Who is he?
I don't know.

Then why is he just staring?
Mom, shh!

Trust me, not an issue at all.

I think he's just a little left of center.
You know, I was thinking,
I can see myself staying here longer.
Nina, you start college in the fall.
Yeah, I know but, you know, they're actually saying they need more hands at the orphanage.
I don't know, that's pretty big.

What, bailing?

I don't know, thinking about putting it on hold for a bit.
I don't know.

Look, I understand that you're already having a great time there, but...
"a great time"?
Mom, this is life-changing.
I mean, you don't understand.

There's so much we take for granted back at home and i...
I don't know, I want to stay here and do my part to help out and learn.
I understand that.

But I just think you should think about this really hard before you start making any promises to people.
Your education is very important.
This is an education, mom.
You don't understand.

- Nina, come on!
- Look, I gotta go.

I know.

I love you.
Nina.
Hello?
Nina.

Yeah, barely.
- Are you okay?

Mom, I'm just... i can't talk right now, okay?
Are you drunk?
Are you drunk?
Listen, I have to go.
We're doing this, like, night jungle tourist thing.
It's going to be really fun, so can you just cut me a break, honestly?
Honey, can we just talk for two minutes?
Hey, are you coming with us?
Yeah, let's go.
Nina.
Hello?
Oh, god.

All right, just let her be.
Cut her a break.

Yeah, she'll be fine.
Let's crack this book open.
Oh, we should do that.
We went there!
- No, we didn't.

We were there already.

- No, we didn't.

These guys, they swam with killer piranhas.
Crazy dudes.
Oh, well that will not be us.
We'll try and stay in the boat, raf.
Did I mention that we have a safe aboard the boat to keep your valuables and your passports?
After all, you don't want to lose anything or have them eaten by anacondas, do you?
That's so nice of you.
We'll have to go wrestle them then.
Azeem!
Hey, azeem!

I am euro... from Europe.
That's right.

Euro trash!
Euro trash, oh!
Cheers... to euro trash!

Are we in the jungle yet?
Almost.
What...

Wait.

- Wait, what are you doing?

How's Nina?
She's great!
I think.
I haven't heard from her yet today.
We had an argument last night.
She said she may delay going to college so she can stay there longer.
I guess I didn't handle it that well.
Well, that's understandable.
I'm not sure I'd be comfortable allowing my teenager even to go to Belize, much less stay there.
She's a very mature young lady.
I trust her.
I'm sure she is.
That does not take away from the fact that
Belize is the third most dangerous country in the world.
I know, I've read the un report.
I'm just saying.
Crime is a regular way of life for many people down there.
Drug trafficking is a real issue, especially now that dead-end white collar crimes are going down there to avoid prosecution.
Come to think of it, you'd be really good down there, Johnson.
Hey, relax.
She'll be fine.
I'm outta here.
Anschel?
We have one.
Give me the details.
Anonymous.

- Will pay top dollar.

Incoming tomorrow via Houston.
Flight arrives at 12:15 your time.
Should be to you by 2:30.
- Okay.

Got it.
Let go of me!

Video chat, everyday.
Everyday.
I'm okay.
- Can you just cut me a break?

Hello, jeanie's.
Yes, I need to speak to one of your guests, Nina Johnson.
She's not here no more.
She and her boyfriend went without paying the bill.
Do you know where she went?
No idea.
U.S. embassy Belize.
Hi, yes.

She's traveling in Belize and potentially missing.
- One moment, please.

It's Francisco.
Hi, my name is Kate Johnson.
My 18-year-old daughter, she has not responded to me in over 24 hours.
It's very unlike her.
Uh, she missed our scheduled phone call.
And I've called the hostel she was staying at, they said that she checked out without paying.
Also very unlike her.
Well, miss Johnson, I'm very sorry to hear of your concerns.
Um, the first thing I'll say is that 24 hours on Belize terms isn't quite as long as it feels like for you back home.
And, well, the Internet here could be very spotty.
Yes, well, she has managed to call me and text me on her scheduled times from the hostel before.
I understand.
Look, it's not uncommon for a young adult to get wrapped up in the fun of traveling.
They forget to touch base with home because...
It's completely out of character for her.
I'm a detective in Florida, Mr. orizaga.
And my daughter, she is always very responsible, respectful, especially in situations like this.
Okay.
Well, let me log this and make some calls.
Can I start by taking your daughter's name and where she was staying?
Nina Johnson.

At jeanie's in, uh, punta dia.
I also want to send you a screen-shot of a strange man who has been following her around the hotel.
Look, um...
What I can do is get in touch with the local authorities on your behalf.
Legally, the investigation is in their hands only, but as you know, the embassy is here to assist you as citizens in Belize as much as possible.
So, can I start by taking your details, miss Johnson?
Thank you, yes.
Let us out!
Hey!

You can't do this!
Shut up!
Just stop it!
- No!

You're the reason we're in this in the first place!
Don't you dare try to blame this on me!
I told you those guys were shady the moment i saw them in the bar!
Stop!
Can't both of you just shut up and stop talking?
Look, I don't know where we are or why we're locked in here, but we're gonna have to pull it together and figure out how we're gonna get out.

This is Francisco orizaga.
Hi, it's Kate Johnson.

Miss Johnson, I'm sorry, not yet, but I have spoken to the police station in punta dia.
Yes, I called two different numbers i found online for them.
One was disconnected, the other rang out.
Look, I advise you to be careful dealing with the Belizean police yourself.
The system here isn't quite as advanced as what you might be accustomed to.
I completely understand that, but I'm coming down there.
I can't just sit here and wait.
That may not be necessary just yet, miss Johnson.
It's my job on behalf of the embassy to act as a conduit.
I'm on the red-eye tonight.

Okay, I'll confirm a room for you at the imperial.
It's where all the foreign diplomats stay.
I'll have a rental car dropped off for you and I'll meet you there.
Good.

Francisco?
Hi.

Good to meet you, miss Johnson.
Kate is fine.
You're all checked in.

- Follow me.

- Been here a while?

I was stationed here as a U.S. marine for five years, special ops, before taking this position.
Yeah, most of my family are here.
Life as a marine wasn't for you?
General Saunders and myself, we clashed on a few matters of procedure.
Here's a general map of Belize and a contact sheet of all primary services.
Should help you get your bearings.
Thank you.

Who runs the place?
Chief of police is sergeant Diaz.
It's a small town, so if anything happens, he should know about it.
Look, you might find the local authorities a little short with you.
That's because they have their hands full.
Note taken.
What's the status on the photo i sent you of the strange man in Nina's hostel?
Police have the photo.
They are using it for the investigation.
Look, don't rub them in the wrong way, okay?
You need them on your side.
What's Diaz's crew mostly dealing with within the area?
Drugs.

Most recently, some cartel have expanded their business into people and sex trafficking.
It's been tough for the authorities to stay on top of.
Names of prominent cartels?
Most well-knowns are los huesos, muerte roja, and diamante negro.
Who are the leaders or any known spearheads?
There's a smaller group within muerte roja.
They operate primarily in and around punta dia.
Look, Kate, this is extremely dangerous territory, all right?
Now I know you're a detective yourself, but this is a different world.
Leave the physical searching down to the local authorities.
I'll make sure they're on the case.
Look, if they don't come up with anything new in the next 48 hours, I'll take you to punta dia myself.
I appreciate your concern.
But let me remind you, this is my daughter we're talking about.
48 hours, I can't do.

I understand.
I gotta get back to the embassy.
Thank you, Mr. orizaga.
Francisco's fine.
Francisco.
Excuse me?
Excuse me.
What happened to you?
They took it.
Hi!

Can I help you?
Hello!

Hello.
Hey, I'm Kate Johnson.
- Nina's mother.

June.

They were supposed to be back at work today.
No, that's why I'm here.
- I lost contact with her.

Last time we spoke, she was about to do a jungle tour in punta dia.
Punta dia?
There are no jungle tours in punta dia.

Did something happen to her?
That's what I'm gonna to find out.
That little boy, with the scar...
What happened to him?
They took him.
Who took him?
Uh, can we walk this way, please?
They are the muerte roja.
The cartel.
They own everybody and everything in punta dia.
They took him.
Left him in a field with that scar.
And his parents were never found.
So, he is here.
Sector a?
His father worked for sector a at the tree hut cleaning dishes.
The tree hut?
That's where Nina was the last time I talked to her.
Did you go to the police with this?
The police need to be told about this.
I mean, she could be with the same people.
The police won't help you with sector a.
You do understand that she's my daughter.
And you need to understand that if the police find you snooping around about sector a, they will kill you, and then they will kill him.
And if they have Nina and drew, they will kill them, too.
Please.

Let the embassy find Nina and drew.
So that he... can enjoy what is left of his life.
Thank you, June, for all your help.
I won't tell anyone about the boy.
Please.
I hope you find her.

Goodbye, Kate.
Hi.

No one stayed here by that name.
Can you check your books?

It's spelled n-i-n-a...
I said, no one stayed here by that name.
What's your name?
- Gabrielle.

I recognize your voice from the phone.

You told me that Nina checked out without paying.
No.
Okay, I will take whatever room you have available.
There is no more room left.
I will take the room that just became available.
It is not clean yet.
I'll wait.
Excuse me, have you seen this girl?
Where is she?
How about this man?
Bobo.

So he's maintenance.
- Not here today.

Bye.

Thank you.
Can I help you?
Sergeant Diaz.

Nina Johnson is my daughter.
I believe you guys are tracking her as a missing person.
Can you talk to me about that?
Listen, miss Johnson, we're working on the case.
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.
I'm new here and we're trying to get things in order.
This station is very busy.
I want to know where you're at with the search.
What the hell is going on here?

We're working on that.

She is my daughter, sergeant.
Are you guys looking into the hostel that her and her boyfriend stayed at?
Jeanie's?

- We're working on it.

They keep changing their story about Nina and drew.
First they say that they checked out without paying.
Now they're saying they didn't even stay there.
And the maintenance guy bobo, what do you know about him?
Bobo carmine?
He's harmless.

Listen...
We're in the process of trying to find your daughter.
I have work to do.

Hi, it's Kate.

What?

Yes.

Kate, what are you doing?
I also met a boy who had just been cut open and looked like he had been stitched back up around the kidney area.

Hello?
Yeah, I'm here.

Look, Kate, what I'm about to tell you is in complete confidence.
This is a highly sensitive case, and if anything were to get out, it could compromise the investigation.
Just tell me.
In the past, some of the cartels became involved in illegal organ and body part trafficking.
The boy you saw, he may have had a kidney removed.
Go on.
There are only a handful of cases reported.
We thought the Belizean authorities had largely cleared it up and the main groups involved, they were all shut down.
Apparently not.

Kate, let the police do their work.
Diaz knows what he's doing.
I don't want you to get involved anymore because if you do, you risk putting yourself in a very vulnerable, life-threatening position, and that is no use to your daughter.
I'll be doing everything I can to bring my daughter home.
Bobo.

Bobo.
It's okay.

Help me.

This is you.

Yes?

This is my daughter Nina.

She's my daughter.

I don't know.

Okay, I understand you didn't hurt her.
Do you know where she went?
Please, bobo.

Where did Nina go?
I don't know.

- Yes.

Can i... can I go to dinner with Nina?
No.

Nina is missing, okay?
You... bobo, please tell me where she is.
Do you know where she went?
Uh... with her boyfriend and Albert.
- Albert?

He's, uh, white.

Is he an old man or a young man?
He's a young man.

Where did Albert go?
- I... uh...

They... they go to punta dia and...
And the tree...

You haven't seen them since?

I don't know, no.
Okay, bobo.

Drink?
Yeah, beer please.

You like our Belizean beer, huh?
Yeah, well.

Where are you visiting from?
Florida.
Little break from the hustle-bustle, you know?
How about you?

I'm from here.
Born and raised, huh?
Well, it's a nice town.
What happened to your face?
I fell.
Hey, have you happened to see my friends?
No.
No big deal.

I heard they were traveling here, too.

But I actually prefer to travel solo.
- What can I get you, sir?

That one.
Help!

Please, Nina, drew, help!
- Hey, azeem.

- How are you?

Couldn't sleep.
What do you think is fun around here?
I kind of want to get out on an adventure tomorrow.
Oye!
Looking for a tour or something?
Yeah, I kind of want to get out and see some nature.
Come around tomorrow, around 9:00 A.M.
There's a jungle tour leaving around that time in the morning.
Wow!

- This is Francisco.

There's a probable link between organ theft, muerte roja, and the tree hut.
It's where Nina and drew were before they went missing.
- Go on.

9:00 A.M. I'm gonna retrace my daughter's steps.
I'm going to take the same jungle tour I know she took and I'm doing it undercover.
Hold on, you can't do that.
- Well, I'm doing it.

These people are ruthless and very dangerous, all right?
They've historically paid the police off to keep their mouths shut.
Yeah, big surprise, what else?
The body of a young man was found today floating on the top of the Belize blue hole.
His body was weighted, but apparently insufficiently.
The heart and pancreas were missing.
His name was Albert ingersson.
Kate, listen, the embassy's now working with the police commissioner, okay?
How could you not call me with this immediately?
Because I knew you would do something crazy, which it sounds like you're about to do now anyway.
Nina and drew were with Albert ingersson.
Okay, don't do anything until I get there.
I'll be there tomorrow.
Oh, my god.
What's going on down here?
Be right back.
- Yeah?

- Great.

- Tomorrow.

As soon as we get confirmation on the money transfer, we can transport him into surgery.
Fine.

Good.
- Hi.

Just orange juice for me, please.
Sure.

- Hi there.
Welcome to punta dia.
My name is Rafael.

- I'm Melissa.

That's a beautiful name.
So, Melissa from America is interested in a jungle tour, yes?
Please take a look inside and see if you find anything that will stimulate the adventuress in you.
Wow, this is incredible.
- Even monkeys?

You get to see them all, if you're lucky.
How much is it?
50 U.S. dollars, but for you, 40.
It seems like beauty has gotten the best of my generosity.
- How long does that take?

And yet, you'll have enough time in the jungle to see everything that will blow your mind for a lifetime.
Wow.
Azeem, let's get the Belizean special for this fine American lady.
Coming up.
Oh, what's that?
You like rum, yes?
Thank you.
Please, enjoy.
- Excuse me one moment.

Wow, that went down fast.
You like it, huh?
Mmm.
These guys, they swam with killer piranhas.
Crazy dudes.
That is crazy.
Oh, did I mention that we have a safety deposit box aboard the vessel to keep your valuables and your passport, if you want.
After all, you don't want them to be eaten by anacondas, do you?
No!

Thank you.
Wow, that drink was really strong.
Melissa, I'd like you to meet Antoine.
- Hi, Antoine.

Together, we do the best jungle tour in all of Belize.
Bobo.
I'll get a... a virgin tropical, uh, sun... sunshine.
Coming right up, buddy.
Well, you had me at "monkeys".
- I'm in.

A lady that knows what she wants.
I have my truck parked outside.
It will take us down to the river.
- Come this way, please.
Okay.
Bobo!
- Hi.

How are you?
Let me guess, looking for the gringo, right?
Maybe.

Yeah, a gringo called Kate Johnson.
- No.

- Don't know.

Look, I don't know anything about anything, okay?
Fantastic.
Thank you.

Mister!
Uh, m... mister!
You must be bobo!
Yeah, bobo.
Have you seen something?
Mm...
It's all right, man, you can tell me.
The mother and the... the daughter.
Yeah.
You seen 'em?
Yeah, this is orizaga.

I'm on the east bank river five miles north of punta dia.
Yeah.

Wait one moment, lady.
Please, give me the gun.
I said, "give me the gun!"
Thank you.

Ow, ow.
- Aah!

I need her inside in one piece.
- Drew!

- Oh, my god!

Drew.

Where's Nina?
The doctor took her to the room at the end of the hall.
Why?

They're going to kill her for her organs.
It's what they did to Albert, and i...

We need to go get her!
Grab the keys!

Let's get the body under the mattress.
Okay.
Go.
Stop!
What are you doing in here?
I'm taking my daughter back.
- Mom.

Hey!
Get these two out of here.

Get in there.
Okay?

What you looking at?
You stay here.
What?
- Nothing.

- What?

- No, the woman...

The woman and the kid got out, but we got it under control now.
How did you let that happen, idiota?
Look, if this ever happens again,
I'll personally kill you.
- Sí, jefe.

- Sí, jefe.

Sí, sí.
Sí.
You, go up front.
Okay, boss.
Do you really think I'm gonna let you murder my daughter?
You can't stop us.
Back off!
You guys okay?
Yeah.
You guys go left.

Stop!
- It's me.

Yeah, we gotta move.
The others would've heard that shot by now.

Come on, honey.

We gotta move.

Come on, let's move.
Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.
Okay, come on.
- Go faster.

Into the jungle, come on.
The main road is about a mile ahead.
- Okay.

- Yeah.

Go, go.

- Go.

Keep going.
He's coming.
No!
No!

- No!

- No!

- Drew!

I'm sorry, we gotta go.
- Come on!

- Come on.

- Go!

We gotta keep moving.
- Let's go!

What are you doing?
- Keep going.

Get her out of here.

Move.
Go!

I'll kill you.
You're gonna die!
I'll kill you!
Get off me!
- No!

Run!

Go!

You really thought I would make some stupid woman cost me 20,000 bucks.
Walk!
- Lock the mother inside.

Yes, in the Van.
You let them escape twice from the cell, remember?
No, no, no.

- Take me instead, please.

It doesn't work that way, lady.
But don't worry, I'll make sure that we find yours a good home, too.
- Let's go.

Run!

Hey!

It's over.
It's over.
Muerte roja, and sector a has been an ongoing problem for our district.
Sergeant Diaz was brought in this month to punta dia to clean it up after the police commissioner was tipped off that the previous sergeant and all the officers were being paid off by the local cartel.
They had a deal with the Guatemalan border patrol, who were releasing papers on request saying that the victims had already left Belize.
Led the families on a false trail.
And the local police kept the victim's passports hidden on site.
That is correct.

Eventually, we'll return them.
Sergeant Diaz, he briefed me on the case.
The tree hut has been a consistent hub of criminal activity for sector a.
Azeem Jones, the proprietor, he was under extreme duress to facilitate in the kidnapping of tourists for organ trafficking.
They said that they would kill his family if he didn't comply.
Rafael was the head runner of the group.
With him gone, we have a good chance of taking down the entire cartel.
Who is Dr. anschel?
He's a corrupt surgeon the United States has been wanting to prosecute for years for malpractice.
He came here years ago for the non-extradition laws in Belize...
And then he started a lucrative underground trafficking clinic.
Something very similar happened to my nephew Jose many years ago.
That's why I became so personally involved in your case.
It feels good.

I bet.
If anyone deserves a promotion, Kate, it's you.

- Thank you.

All right.

Look, I, uh, i gotta go.
- Okay.

Who were you talking to?
No one.
Okay.

Just have your fruit.
So I got a phone call today from June.
And?
And she's looking forward to having us there next summer.
Me, too.
Here's to making a difference.
Cheers.
I love you, mom.
I love you, too.
