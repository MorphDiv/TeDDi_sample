Subtitles by Bambula
Fifteen years ago, a scientific experiment gone wrong gave RISE to a species of intelligent apes and destroyed most of humanity with a virus that became known as Simian Flu.
RISE
With the DAWN of a new ape civilization led by Caesar, the surviving humans struggled to coexist.
But fighting finally broke out when a rebel ape, Koba, led a vengeful attack against humans.
DAWN
The humans sent a distress call to a military base in the North, where all that remained of the U.S. Army was gathered.
A ruthless Special Forces Colonel and his hardened battalion were dispatched to exterminate the apes.
Evading capture for the last two years, Caesar is now rumoured to be marshalling the fight from a hidden command base in the wood, as the WAR rages on.
WAR
WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES
MONKEY KILLER
BEDTIME FOR BONZO
ENDANGERED SPECIES
Cap.
Is that a trench?
It looks like there's more of them inside.
Echo 2-6 to command.
Colonel, we've got eyes on 3 kongs in the north woods.

Our donkey just spotted another trench.

Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

Donkey.
Preacher.
The one with the gun.
As soon he guns him down, you guys take out the trench.

Fire!
Come on!
Reload.
Fall back!
Colonel, do you copy?

Who is this?

I need your position.

I can't see anything, sir.

Calm down.

I think it's just me by myself now.
Colonel, I don't think I'm gonna make it, sir.
I am sorry.

Listen to me.

No.

63 dead.
You are him.

We've been searching for you for so long.
We heard you had a hidden command base, but we could never find it.
Some of us were starting to think that you might be dead, but the Colonel McCullough said you were out here somewhere.

What?

I did not start this war.
The ape who did is dead.
His name was Koba.
I killed him.
Now I fight only to protect apes.

What about him?

I know these apes.

They tried to kill me.
They fear what I will do to them.
So now they serve you... just to survive.
I no fear you!
You must fear!
How long you think woods can protect you?
Humans destroy you.
Their Colonel has all power.
For them, he more than just human.
He everything.
He say: "First Caesar die... then all of you die."
Winter!

What should we do with the humans?
You are letting us go?
Tell your Colonel...

And I have a message for him.

Do you think they will give him the message?
They are the message, Maurice.
He will see we are not savages.
The traitor attacked me!

Koba still haunts us.
What I didn't see that he could not forgive what humans did to him.
No one could have known how much darkness... was living inside him.
Father!
Welcome home, Rocket.
You look tired.
It was a long journey.

Come.
Mother!
Cornelius...

Look who's here, son...
Lake...
This is it, Father.

What is beyond those mountains, son?

A desert!

But that is why humans will not find us.
We must leave tonight!
Tonight?

How long can we wait, Lake?

Your son's been gone, Caesar...
He doesn't know how hard it's been.
I know you are scared...
We all are...
But we are still planning...
Yes.

There were only two of you.
But we are many.
We will find a way out of here.
Apes together strong.
Stay here, son.

Caesar!

How many on patrol?
Five?

Luca, get Rocket too.
Unit calling command.

Rocket?

Ninety-nine, target acquired.
Ninety-nine, target acquired.

Let's go.

Caesar...

He was scared!

Have you found Cornelius yet?
We're still searching.
Let's go look for Caesar's little son.
Come, Cornelius.
You're safe now.
Lake.
You loved my son.
Look after his brother, until I return.
You're not coming with us to our new home?
No.
Go with Lake.
Caesar!

Not them, him.
Caesar, you are our leader!
We can't leave without you!
You must.
The soldiers will be back soon.
Father!
When I find him, the soldiers will all come after me.
That makes you the best chance to get out of woods.
Where is he going?

Caesar!

The soldiers' camp is always moving.

Let me take you.

No!
Please...

I may not make it back.
That's why I'm coming.
To make sure you do.
Guards think soldiers here...

No one here.
Search the area.
Just gonna put this down.
What's he doing out here alone?
Maybe he's a deserter?
Look around.
Take what you can.
Something wrong with her.

Come.
She'll die out here alone.
We cannot take her, Maurice.
I understand...

Did you find the Colonel?
No.
Winter.
Where is the Colonel?
He's gone.

He left this morning, took many men with him.
More soldiers are coming down from the North.
The Colonel is going to meet them at the border.
What border?

I don't know.
But the rest of us are going tomorrow.
Donkeys think the soldiers from the North are coming to help finish off the apes for good.
That day, after the battle on the hill, the donkey we caught promised me the Colonel would spare my life if I told them where you were hiding.
Forgive me!
My son...
My wife... are dead.
Now what do we do?
Wait till the soldiers go...
Follow them to the Colonel.
Koba?
Ape not kill ape.
The soldiers are leaving!
They stopped.
What are they shooting at?
I don't know.
Why did they shoot you?
Like her!
He cannot speak!
He will die of those wounds.
Luca.
Where did the soldiers go?

Winter said they were going to a border.
Yes but which way is that?

Bad... ape.
Bad ape.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
I don't think he understands.
I don't recognize him.

Are you alone here?
Cold?
Cold.
I see girl.

But you ape.

No, no.

How long have you been here?

Home.
Old home.
SIERRA ZOO
Are there more like you?
More apes... from zoo?

Long time.

Ape get smart.
Then human kill ape.

I run.
You learned to speak?

Bad ape!
Bad ape.
No.
No touch.
That's mine.
I am okay.
Amazing...
Always thought we were the only ones.
Wonder if there are more in the world?
More apes like us.
Here.

New friends.
Special day.
CALIFORNIA BORDER QUARANTINE FACILITY
Where did you get this?
Bad place.
I find long time ago.

I find human zoo.
Zoo for sick.
Big walls.

Bad human kill.
And then all get sick.

Bad humans?
Soldiers?
Soldiers.

On the border!
Maybe the Colonel and the troops are going there?
Is it far?

No!

Everyone dead.

Never go back!

No!

No!

More snow.

You eat, you rest, stay here.

Here.

She keep.
Who is... child?
I don't know.
But she with you?
She has no one else.
I see you look at her just now.
Look sad.
You have child?
One.
The other was killed by human.
Soldier?
I...
Had child.
You think you will find him... at human zoo?
Soldier?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Then...
Maybe I take you.
Thirsty.
Thirsty.
Thirsty.
Luca, come.

Keep them safe.
What are they doing?
I don't know.
What's that?

I don't see riders.
Hold it!
I saw them coming.
At least this time...
I was able to protect you...
Caesar...
This must stop.

We cannot turn back!
Luca gave his life.
Please!
They must pay.
Now... you sound like Koba.
It was a mistake bringing you all.
This is my fight.
I will finish this alone.
Go.

Join the others.
What happened?
They came out of nowhere...
Attacked us.
We thought they would kill us all...
But the Colonel stopped them!
There was madness in his eyes!
He said they would use us, before we died!
And they brought us all here!
Use you?
They've been forcing us to work!
What...
What kind of work?
Wait.

Grant... and Lee.
Wellington... and Napoleon.
Custer and Sitting Bull...
You're probably not much of a reader, but this is a big moment.
Where were you?
We came upon your herd.

I was surprised you weren't with them.
I hope you don't come to regret sparing his life.
He's quite a good shot.
Have you finally come to save your apes?
I came for you.
For me?
Who did I kill that night?
My wife.
My son.
I'm sorry.
I was there for you.
God.
Look at your eyes.
Almost human.
How did you know I was here?

That more soldiers from the north... would be joining you here.

To finish us off.
For good.
Who told you that?
Okay.
Let's go.
Father!
Father!
Lake.
Forgive them.

Father!
What have I done?
Battalion, halt!
Blood!

We!

We are the beginning!

We haven't had food or water since we got here...
Why do they need a wall?
Donkey!
Get him!

Okay.
Leave him!
Tell them to get back to work.

Tell them.

Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
Hurry!

String him up, donkey.
Bad place.
Bad, bad place.
What you see?
Must save them!

No!
Why so small?
What did the Colonel promised you?
You really think he let you live?
After we are gone?
You let them call you donkey.
You are ape.
Colonel wants see you.
HISTORY
Interfere with the work again, I will begin slaughtering the apes, one by one.
Understand?

Apes need food and water.

Give apes food and water.
Or they cannot finish it.

What makes you think you're in a position to make demands?
Okay, let's go.

I saw men outside, on the wall, preparing for battle.
They told me you're smart, but that's impressive.
No, they won't be joining me.
They are against you?
They fear me.
Why?

We found bodies.
Something wrong with these men.
Jesus Christ, you are impressive.
You paint quite a picture.

I think you have no mercy.
You came here to kill me.
Were you going to show me mercy?
I showed you mercy when I spared your men.
I offered you peace and you killed my family.
Mercy.
Do you have any idea what your mercy would do to us?
You're much stronger than we are.
You're smart as hell.
No matter what you say, you'd eventually replace us.

The irony is, we created you.
We tried to defy Nature, bend it to our will.
And Nature's been punishing us for our arrogance ever since.
Ten months ago, I sent out recon units to look for your base.
My own son was a soldier with one of the units.
One day he suddenly stopped speaking.
He became primitive, like an animal.
They contacted me, said that they thought he'd lost his mind, that the war was too much for him.
Then the man who cared for him stopped speaking too.
Their medic had a theory, before he stopped speaking, that the virus that almost wiped us out, the virus that every human survivor still carries, had suddenly changed.
Mutated.
And if it spread, it would destroy humanity for good this time.
Not by killing us, but by robbing us of the things that make us human.
Our speech, our higher thinking.
It would turn us into beasts.

What would you have done?
It was a moment of clarity for me.
I realized that I would have to sacrifice my only son, so that humanity could be saved.
I held that gun in my hand for a long time...
And I pointed it at my only child.
He looked at me with trust in his eyes.
Even in his primitive gaze,
I felt his... love.
I pulled the trigger.
It purified me.

I gave orders to kill the others infected, all of them.
Burn their belongings, anything that might spread contamination.
Some of the men questioned my judgment.
I was asking them to do what I had done, to sacrifice their friends, their family.
Of course, they refused.
I had them killed too.
Others with children deserted into the woods.
One of those cowards fled to my superiors up north.
They tried to convince me that this plague could be dealt with medically.
That's when I realized that they had learned nothing from our past.
You killed them too?
What did I do, Preacher?
You severed their heads, sir.
Except for the one I spared so he could return and deliver a message.
If they wanted to relieve me of my command, they'd have to meet me here, and do it themselves.
This used to be a weapons depot.
They turned it into a relocation camp when the crisis was just beginning.
But the weapons are all still here, inside the mountain.
How many men will be coming?
Probably all of them.
But don't get any ideas, the only thing they fear more than me is you apes.
This is a holy war.
All of human history has led to this moment.
If we lose, we'll be the last of our kind.
It will be a planet of apes, and we'll become your cattle
Look at you.
You think I am sick, don't you?
I didn't mean to kill your son.
But if his destiny was to inherit your unholy kingdom...
I am glad I did.
Get back!
So emotional!
I see how conflicted you are.
You are confused in your purpose.
You're angry at me for something I did that was an act of war.
But you're taking this all much far too personally.
What do you think my men would have done to your apes, if you had killed me?
Or is killing me more important?
Soldiers everywhere!

Must get in somehow...

In?

No!
No go in!

Friends!

No go in!
Friend!

Thank you.

You save our lives!
Sick humans must have escaped down here!
No, no!

What?

APE-POCALYPSE NOW
Wonder where we are.
No!

No!
No!
No!

No!

Come!

No!

Come!

Koba...
Sleep.
You cannot save them.
Apes all die here.
No!

Join me...
If he's still alive in the morning...
He goes back to work as everyone else.
Or you shoot him.
Come.

She go in!
Thirsty?
Hide.

Humans will kill her!
I know what to do!

Are there others out there?
Sweep the area.
Put him in the pen.
Feeling better?
Good.

Apes together strong!
We are the beginning!

Still alive.
Send him to the quarry.

Hold on.
What is this?
How did this get in there?
Get him to work.
Thirty-seven.
Fifty-five.
Thirty-seven steps to the adult cage.
Fifty-five to the children.
DONKEY
You know, Colonel shoot apes when wall is done.
This wall is madness.
It won't save him.
Anymore that it will save you.
I save myself.
Is there anything left of you to safe?
Up!
Apes going back to the cage?
You are very brave.
Brave?

Brave!
Ape?
Me?

You are...
Nova.
Nova.
Come!

Come to see!
Come!

34, 35, 36, 37!

I do.
What now?
What?
No!
No!
No, no!

Okay.
This is the ape I told you about!
Thank you.
Bad Ape.
Bad Ape.
Bad...

What's wrong?
We can't keep digging!

If we don't, we can't reach the children!
We must keep looking down there...
Find another way to reach the children.
We must leave now!

Humans will destroy each other!

We'll have to get the children out above ground.
How?
You animals!
Who did that?
Who did that?
Who was it?
Was it you?
I love you, son.
Go, go.
Hurry!

Caesar, what's wrong?
Hurry.

Without you?
No.
Maurice was right.
I am like Koba.
He could not escape his hate.
And I still cannot escape mine.
Move!

Colonel!

Where the hell is he?
Hurry up!
Colonel, are you in there?

Donkey!

God damn it, donkey!

THE BEGINNING THE END
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Maurice...
You are home now.
Apes are strong...
With or without me.
Son will know... who was father.
And what...
Caesar did... for us.
Caesar...
