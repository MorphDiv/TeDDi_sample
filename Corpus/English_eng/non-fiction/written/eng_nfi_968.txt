Hey, Apple Bloom!
Rarity's re-organizing her shop and look what she found!
Old costumes from the talent show!
We thought they'd come in handy in case we ever help a Pony put on a play or need to make a quick escape disguised as clowns!
Here you go, Big Mac.
Whoa!

Are you making another delivery to Starlight's old village?
Yeeeup.
That's an awful long way for a Pony to go, isn't it?
Yeeeup.
You've been going there a lot lately.
What is this?

[giggle]
Yeeeup.
OK, well, have fun!
So what other costumes did you bring, Sweetie Belle?
Are you crazy?
We can't talk about costumes at a time like this!
Time like what?
Your brother is hiding something.
Did you see the way he was acting?
Yeah, he totally blushed when you brought up how often he's been going to Starlight's old village.
Something is definitely going on.
There can only be one reason a Pony would travel so far, so often.
He's taking private skiing lessons!
- He's training for a marathon!

Maybe he's a spy on a mission to thwart an evil villain with his secret weapon:
an Apple Cannon!
No, that's crazy.

Why don't we just ask him?
You saw how shifty he was acting earlier.
There's no way he'll tell us what he's doing.
Plus, I really want to go undercover.
We already have costumes.
Call me, Agent Rainbowhead.
I'll be Shimmering Spectacles:
a librarian with a mysterious past.
And I'll be a pirate spy.

Oh!

Huh?
Big Mac's leaving.
If we're gonna be spies, we gotta go NOW!

Who's that Pony?
Let me see!
I don't know.

I don't know anyPony here.
That must be Sugar Belle.
Applejack told me about her bakery.
Obviously, she's just been ordering a lot of apples.
So nothing fishy's going on.
No way!

And no spy I know has ever solved a case that quick.
How many spies do you know?
That's not important.
What's important is that we do more recon!

Yeeeup.
All I used to bake were boring old muffins.
But thanks to your apple deliveries,
I get to bake all kinds of delicious treats!
Apple pies, apple fritters, apple turnovers, caramel apples, caramel apple cakes... [sigh]
I just wish I had more room to display it all.
My shelves only hold so much.
I'm telling you, this Pony really likes her apples!
[gasp] Or Big Mac!
Huh?
Just look!
Ooh!

[giggle]
Sweetie Belle, I think you're right!
I think my brother has a crush!
Shhhh!
Psst!

Now remember, my brother's super shy so he's probably going to be embarrassed about his crush.
Just try and make him feel comfortable.
Hey, Big Mac!

Yeeeup.
We're here, too!
Mm hm.
I'm going to ask you a very personal question and I want you to answer honestly.
Do you... have a crush...

Yeeeup.
Well, that was easy!
This is so exciting!
My big brother has his very first crush!
First crush?

It doesn't really count when you trick a Pony into drinking a love potion, does it?
Nope.
My brother has a cra-ush!

My brother has a cra-ush!
Wait.

Nuh uh.
Then you gotta tell her!

Seriously?

She'll never pick me.
Sure she will, cause we're gonna help you!
No love potions!

Don't worry, Big Mac.

Yeah, we're never gonna do that again.
Besides, I know exactly what to do!
When I was younger I read all the fairy tales.
When you were younger, huh?
Well, I was younger on the way here.
It was a long ride!
Anyway, as long as we do what the book says, you're pretty much guaranteed a happy ending!
How 'bout this one?

Rescuing a damsel Pony in distress.

Of course, we'll have to improvise without a dragon.
Hm!

[giggles]
So what should we do?
Wait around for Sugar Belle to get herself into a scary situation?
OR we bring the danger to her!

All right, Scootaloo's gonna pretend to take
