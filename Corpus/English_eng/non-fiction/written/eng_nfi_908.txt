Previously on "Famous In Love.."
Happy birthday, Paige.
I would sell my soul for one of those and my soul
- would be worth around $4000.

None of this would have been possible without you.
Oh, there she is.

Rainer is in the middle of the biggest film of his life.
He deserves to know who his father is.
His father just became head of the studio.
- So what's your deal?

- 'At your service.'

Take your money and get out of here.
I'm telling you that's not mine.
'Ma'am, step out of the vehicle now.'
Remember, we agreed on 50 more bucks?
I need the money for school.
I'm so glad you decided to celebrate our little victory after all.
I really wanna have a great working relationship together.
- Fresh start?

Jake, if you don't show up tonight you could seriously damage this friendship.
♪ Whoa whoa whoa whoa ♪
'Thank you again.'
Best birthday ever.
I had a really, really great time.
Me too.
- When am I gonna see you again?

- But we have two days off.

I have a scene today and I have to study.
I may be failing econ, so I have to get up the rest of my grades to As to offset my GPA.
Maybe I can help you study.
Did he come to the party last night?
No, he didn't.
Hey.
Let's go to Vegas.
Two syllables for you.

Ah!

I have a lease share.
Private jet.
That sounds like a date.
Nope.

Invite Cassie, invite Jake.
The plane seats six, invite two more.
Well, Cassie is definitely down, but Jake is a wildcard.
Have you ever been to The Buffet at the Bellagio?
No.
Lime-soaked ceviche.
Angry mac and cheese, which has a smoky, chipotle flavor.
- Go on.

And we can wash it all down with a bacon double decker from Fuku.
And my boy Vince knows this really great tutor May.
So between hangovers, you can study.
You had me at bacon double decker.

- Hey, Cass.

You know, it's all downhill from here.
Don't I know it?
Um, hey, did Jake say anything to you when he came in last night?
Like why he didn't come to my birthday?
No, but he just came home this morning so my guess is he stayed at Alexis's place.
Great.

Oh, um, I forgot.
I have this dinner scheduled with the, uh president of Gold Brothers next week.
Oh, hey, uh, did the three diamond bracelet ever come back from the jewelers?
I should probably wear it to dinner.
Um, yeah, no, I just checked on it the other day 'and he was still resizing it' but that was a few days ago, so I will check again.
Great.

But I sold it for $2000.

'Sorry, honey.

'You sell it to me at a discounted rate' 'and I upsell it.'
Okay.

Hey, it's Lacey.

Yeah, that's right.

Hey, I'm headed out.

Okay.
What's up?
Maybe an explanation of why you didn't make my birthday party last night?
Something came up.
I'll take you out to Los Amigos this week.
Later.
Oh, I cannot even with him right now.
Totes just noticing this, but are you wearing his shirt?
- So did you do it?

No, of course not.
In fact, he gave me the bed and he slept on the couch.
- No, come on.

Oh, by the way, he invited us to fly on his private jet and spend two days in Vegas staying at the Bellagio.
- No.

Wait, we as in me?
Yes.

Yes, totally.
I'm in, I'm so in!
Uh, I have to skate for my shift at the Pizza Dome.
Hey, Cass.
You think I should invite Jake, right?
No.
Look, if he wants to work on contracting every STD known to man, that is his deal.
But you and I are going to be drinking yard full of margaritas while we hit the clubs.
- Love you.

'We have a big problem, Alan.'
Is this about the Chinese distributors?
They are threatening to pull out because they think that Tangey's role as the Time Sorceress is a ghost.
- So..

It's cultural.
The Chinese refuse to release anything that has a ghost or a spirit in it.
And I don't do seafood on Sundays.
What?

Let me speak a language you do understand.
- Hmm.

"Ghostbusters" and "Crimson Peak" never released in China.
- That means millions lost.

That I speak fluently and that's nothing a phone call can't fix.
I'll call today.
Getting lost in translation is not gonna secure your distribution, Alan.
Your producer is.

To China?
You are right in the middle of production.

You know this is how the Chinese do business.

They sit down, have tea and bargain.
It's a process.

And obviously, they're not finished yet.
I'm going to Hong Kong.

- So I guess we're partying.

Good.

Study sess was never gonna happen on game day.
Bro, the game isn't for another six hours.
Dude, hardcore pre-gaming happening right now.
Keg's over there.

Look, I ain't mad at it.
Oh, and there's some strippers or something in there.
- No way.

'Hey, Jake, grab me a drink.'
'Yeah, I got it.'
'Cassie?

Hey, have you seen Cassie?
Um, no.

But you haven't heard from her like in the last hour?
- No, why?

- I was hoping she'd be here.

You know what?

Just, uh, let me know if you hear from her.
Jake, hey.
Is there something going on?

Jake, it's me.
She was at my friend's study-group-turned-party..
Working as a topless maid.
What?
She ran out and I-I haven't been able to reach her.
Wait.

I-I-I feel awful.
She must feel so humiliated.
That's why she hasn't called me back.
Don't worry.

You called me over here.

I'm your mother.

Bail me out.
- No.

I've been bailing you out my whole life.
I just handed you 50K for your nail salon in Tucson and you still land here on drugs.
I've been clean for months, Jordy.
- Don't call me Jordy.

May I have your autograph?
That coke wasn't mine.
And if you didn't plant it, then that bitch you was with did.
That was all you and you know it.
She framed me, J, 'cause I didn't do this.
- It really is amazing.

How you blame other people for your problems.
Nina wouldn't frame you.
Oh, you don't feel like talkin'?
Fine.

Your girlfriend's mom stopped in.
- Ida?

- Nothing.

But she did put me in touch with someone I might trust.
I trust Barrett Hopper would be willing to invest 5K into bailing me out and, uh, that type of generosity motivates all kinds of talkin'.
Honey, pack your bags.

You know I love egg drop soup, mother but not enough for a 15-hour flight.
I need to convince our Chinese distributors to uphold their agreement to release "Locked".
And you, my son, are the face of it.
- I thought Jordan was.

But the Chinese love you.
You have a presence there already.
When?
- Tonight.

Rain, if those plans involve your standard silicon implants and hair extensions, cancel.
The plane leaves in three hours.
I can't believe you're springing a 15 hour flight at me at the eleventh hour.
Well, I'm a suit.

But you, you're the face of "Locked" and a huge star in China ever since "Dragons in the Sand" was released.
What about hiring Jordan for his international sales?
Take him as your carry-on if he is so valuable in the foreign market.
Jordan's an important part of the movie, but..
You're the first face they'll see on the poster.
I'll bring a deck of cards.
We can play hearts.

- We'll fly private.

Yay.
Kyle said she hasn't worked at the Pizza Dome in weeks.
What?

She must really be in trouble.
I just don't understand why she didn't reach out to us.
Zack's douchebag friends were calling her Lacey.
Paige, I think she's been hiding this for a while.
She made up a fake name.
- Oh, my God.

I was, I was on the phone with her the other day and somebody in the background called for Lacey.
And I..

I've been so consumed in this stupid movie and Wyatt always yelling at me all the time that I..
It was right in front of my face and I didn't even see it.
I'm such a bad friend.
Hey, I didn't know either.
I had no clue.
Where would Cassie go if she was trying to escape everything?
You better not have cheaped-out in the meal service.
- Never.

Whatever it is, it must be pretty important 'cause it keep blowing up your phone all mornin'.
I hate to ask you, but are you and Alexis like a thing now?
- That was my agent, actually.

Yeah.

I just called him earlier to let him know I might not make it.
Wait?

I already sold it.
Yeah, to Newcastle Studios.
No way!

That's so..

That's amazing.

You know, the three of us haven't exactly been talking a lot lately.
Ah, shoot, um, I'm supposed to be, uh at my fitting right now for production.
How long will your fitting take?

Then my meeting will take like a half hour, if that.
We can meet up after to continue the search?
- Okay.

You better leave your picky eating habits in the US, Alan.
The Chinese consider it rude not to sample each and every dish served.
I've been successfully conducting international business for years.
You just better let me do the talking because the Chinese regard patience and politeness above other qualities.
Guys, give it a rest.

- Hey, Rainer.

Um, slight change of plans.
He better not be screwing his co-star.
Isn't that one of the perks of the job?
Guys.
Uh, Rainer?
'Hey, sorry.

So I-I have to go to Hong Kong to meet with a few Chinese "Locked" distributors.
'Guess they're getting cold feet.'
Don't worry about it.
Stuff's pretty crazy down here right now anyway.
'Cassie is dealing with this thing and..'
- What's wrong?

'I can't reach her.

But I am really starting to get worried.
Okay.

I'll fly from Hong Kong to Vegas and meet you both there.
I'm buying you and Cass tickets right now.
Check your inbox.
There's no way you're getting out of this, Miss Townsen.

Bye.
Were you really surprised?
Completely.
So crazy how many people showed up.
You guys were all in on it?
Mm.

That party must have cost a fortune.
- Hey, Vince.

Oh, thanks.
Uh, by the way, do you have any aspirin?
My head is killing me.
Hey, I'll check with the set medic but, uh
I'm not your assistant.
I can't be running around for you when I got things to do for Rainer.
- I'm just saying.

I-I thought you were a set PA like Adam.
Nope.

'You're the star of a major studio motion picture.'
You could probably have three.
Pick a hot chick, would ya?

Wait, wait, wait.

Well, we're not.

You booked my rooms while on my desk.
You know that I can't sleep in any bed besides Ritz' beds.
Mom, do you have a Dramamine?

- Car sickness is psychosomatic.

Motion sickness is miserable.
Take it from a guy who travels a lot.
Thank you.

I can't ride on roller coasters, boats.
'Me either.'
One of my girlfriend's talked me into this Alaskan cruise but I only lasted a night.
Had to wait it in a motel in Ketchikan while she saw eagles and whales and bears.
Oh, my!

Thought you said, it was psychosomatic.
Yeah, for you.
Yeah, well, since then
I take it with me everywhere I go.
- Here you go.

Hey, Adam, um, you haven't talked to Cassie lately, have you?
I mean, you saw her last night, obviously but in the last few hours or so?
Yeah, not since this morning.
That's great, by the way, the whole you and Cassie thing.
It's just great.
Hey, if she reaches out to you in any way can you just let her know that we're pretty worried and she should call or text us.
Okay, mom.
Anybody home?
Hey.
Ooh.

I'm trying to go gluten free.
So I ran into Paige on set today.
I really think you should text her.
Hey, what is it?
If you knew, you might not like me anymore.
I've been around.

Well, my private loan fell through and I've fallen behind on my CMU tuition payments.
So I took a job as a..
A topless maid.
Well, a hooker would've been bad.
But topless maid, who cares?

So what's the problem?
I had a job this morning..
And it was kind of a party..
And my friend Jake showed up.
Well.
- Awkward.

But, hey, Cassie.
I promise you..
Your friends will understand.
'Ni hao.'
Thank you for your hospitality and receiving us so graciously into your country.
Pleased to have you.
Thank you for making the trip.
Your English is impeccable, Miss Lin.
As I was saying over the phone we wanna clear up any misunderstanding regarding the Time Sorceress character in "Locked".
The Time Sorceress is not a ghost.
Or a spirit.
The Sorceress moves around in time like "The Terminator".
Just like "The Terminator."
- Schwarzenegger?

But you see, "The Terminator"
was not set in a specific time period.
Since "Locked" is in present day 'jumping around in time is inauspicious' 'for the Chinese people' considering our belief in reincarnation.
'The only way we can distribute "Locked" in China' is if you cast a Chinese actress in the role of Time Sorceress.
Xu yifei is one of China's fastest rising stars.
'She's perfect for the part.'
But Tangey's already playing that role.
Yeah, we've, uh, we've already shot half those scenes.
Done.

Jake, why won't she just text me back?
She hasn't posted anything on Insta or Snap.
Maybe it's not about this.
Maybe it's more about the movie.

Yeah.
She still complains about it.
