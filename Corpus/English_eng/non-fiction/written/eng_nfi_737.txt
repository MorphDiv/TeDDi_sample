I have to go get him something.
What?

You won't even miss it.
He's your dad, isn't he?
No, he's my son.
He touched me.

Get on your knees.
Guys wearing white suits.

With designs on world domination.
Shit.
Ow!
This one's for you, charlie.
Oh, crap!
Time is running out!
It won't be long now!
Y'all can try to ignore it.
But it's gonna be hard to ignore when your face is on fire!
It's all about to be over.

Over!
Look for the signs, you sorry sonsabitches.
'cause shit is about to get real!
No god.
No men in white suits.

Maybe i was wrong about this place.
Maybe it was a bad idea.
No.

Look, there's more to the city
Than bloody jazz and almost getting killed.
I think we should just take a break, have some fun.

I know denis knows what I'm talking about, isn't that right, denis?
What do you think?
Me?

I know just the place.
Ten, nine, eight...
Seven, six, five, four...
Three, two, boom.
Yeah!
Hold up.

All's you got to do...

Heck, my boyfriend will do that!
What?

Oh, come on!
It's like a what?

Yeah.

Excuse me.

What do you think the good lord would say about this?
I think he'd say, "go back to your choir boys
And mind your own business, preacher."
Listen to your hearts, men.
Ask yourselves,
"is this really the right thing to do?"
Oh, i'm sorry.
I didn't realize this was ladies' night!
Now, i got a bunch of money.
You got a bunch of guns.
So why don't y'all stop being a bunch of bitches
And shoot my boyfriend.
What's your pleasure?
Ooh.
Um...
The big ones pay more, right?
Okay.
So, in that case...
Why not choose the biggest one?
The biggest?
If you have such a love for money
And so little love for life,
Why not pick the biggest one they got?
Or maybe it's ladies' night, after all.
I think one of the smaller...
All right.

You got it.
Oh, dear god.
You got this.

Remember, just hold your breath.
And i love you.
I love you, too.
Uh...
All right, gentle--
Sweetie?
Sweetie?

He's gone.
What?
No-o-o-o-o-o!
Someone call the police.
you're all witnesses.
i call upon your christian sense of decency
To stand up and give your account.
Here.
You okay?
Are you kidding me?
Open bar.
In new footage from the nghe an province of vietnam,
We're witnessing what some are referring to as a miracle
And what others are dismissing as a simple hoax.
Home.
I am having fun.
Yeah.

Very convincing.
Yeah.
Come on.

I don't want to sleep, jesse.
How many times do i have to tell you?
What is your problem?
Ever since the saint --
What's your problem, huh?
Let's go.
Let's just go yourself.
You can't just...

that's not a comeback.
He's gone, right?
You sent him back to hell?
He's gone.
Come on.
Let's go home.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

The night's still young!
We haven't even drank the armagnac yet!
bollocks.
Sorry about that, dennis.

Yeah.

All right?
Excuse me.

This man has been trying to tell you that he's very unhappy.
Yeah?

I'm a french professor from tulane.
Oh, right.
Would you, uh -- would you mind, professor?
Well, he -- and my condolences --
Says that he is dying.
What?
Congestive, uh, heart disease.
He's been telling you that...
You've been an awful, uh, selfish, absent father.
Uh, he keeps repeating
That there's something you can do, though,
That would make it all up to him.
Yeah?

He says that he wants to live forever.
And he thinks that you can help him do that.
What?

No.

No.

Do you hear me?
No.
He said then, um, he will die hating you.
Yeah.

Meanwhile, media specialists speculate
That this may be simply a viral marketing ploy,
Publicizing an as-yet-unrevealed film
Or perhaps a weight-loss drug.
Yes, it's serious.
They're praying to a pig.
This will require resources.
Prep the invalid scientist.
Mm!
Mnh.

I expect we'll need an extra 30 operatives,
All fully equipped with, uh...
Second thought, never mind.
I have the situation under control.
You missed a spot.
I...

Don't worry, little boy.
I was young and careless...
Once.
Klaus helmut starr.
Born -- hamburg, germany.
Only child of parents killed in a plane crash.
Orphaned at age 4.
Currently lieutenant-colonel of
Germany's gsg 9 elite anti-terrorism unit,
Where your exploits were...
Numerous.
How was your flight?
I hope you found the hotel accommodating.
I was told there'd be women.
Women?
A high-end brothel staffed entirely by ukrainian runaways.
There will be women...

But it's my impression, herr starr,
That what you really want is...
"to sweep the streets clean
Of the parasites that befoul our society
And create a civilization based on the principles
Of absolute order and uncompromising discipline."
Your words, i believe.
What if i told you
That our organization feels exactly the same way you do?
Like a 10-inch dick,
I'd need to see it to believe it.
And maybe you shall.
Tell me Are you christian, herr starr?
Does it make a difference?
This is just the first step
In our organization's rigorous screening process.
Only the most deserving -- and, yes, pious --
Candidates will be considered.
Then i am very much...
A christian.
He's one of mine.
Shit.

Shit.

Time's up.
"hearme!

And know the signs of the world to come!
Look for the changes, for things impossible.
The dying land, the falling sky,
The beasts of the field thrown into confusion."
Hey.

I dreamt about him again.
"...

Falling like french fries on tv.
I'm sorry.
You were late.
You almost didn't make it.
I know.

I had my hands pretty full myself.
I got back, i stopped him, that's it.
Can't you feel it, jesse?
Hmm?
That -- that "something's not right" feeling?
No, i can't.
I don't know what to tell you, tulip.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go talk to a man about the end of the world.
You want to come?
'course you don't.
Where's cassidy?

Hello?
Hello!
Oh, bollocks.

Today...
You will compete in a series of trials
Designed to test your abilities.
You have all been selected because you are,
Simply put, the best.
The strongest.

And yet, only one of you
Will prove worthy enough to join our ranks.
But before we begin, are there any questions?
Do you validate parking?
No, we do not.
Â£12 an hour, and you don't validate?
It's standard policy.
Then it should have been clearly stated as such beforehand
So that i may have found street parking,
Or -- more likely, given the failure of this organization
To in any way convenience me -- not come at all.
Validate his car.
But starr,
From here on out, we do the testing.
We've come a long way when it comes to weapons of warfare.
But sometimes,
There is no substitution for hand-to-hand violence.
Starr.

I want everyone to know that what is about to transpire,
I take no pleasure in it.
And...
What the hell are you doing?

What does it look like?

Ugh.
Very good.
Please, take note that a distraction,
No matter how unseemly,
Can very often be the thing that turns the tide in your favor.
Since the days of cleopatra,
Sexuality has been a weapon deployed to gain leverage.
This is the art of seduction.
I know we come from different sides.
But i think -- no, i know --
We can put all that behind us.
We can make something beautiful and new.
All you have to do...
Is meet me at the train station with the microfiche.
And...

Whew.

Anyone know where i can get a copy of that microfiche?
Yes.

And...

I told you already, mr.

The answer is "no."
I shouldn't even be meeting you right now.
Give me the microfiche, you bitch,
Or i'll kill you and your family.
two final candidates.
One last opportunity to prove your worth.
Proceed.
Good luck.
Welcome to the grail.
"the grail"?
Please, herr starr, have a seat.
For over 2,000 years,
This organization has been at the very heart of world affairs.
What do you think is the source of our enduring power?
I would imagine a combination of economic influence
And sexual blackmail.
Some, of course.
But the true inspiration
Of our authority is... christ.
Hmm.
You seem disappointed.
I was hoping for something more in the vein of atomic warfare,
Not myths and legends.
This is no myth.
Christ lives on.
Yes, yes, he lives in our hearts.
No, herr starr.
Christ lives in a top-secret location
Guarded by machine guns.
Does he?
Yes.
You see, before he sacrificed himself for our sins,
Our lord gave a final gift to humanity --
He fathered a child.
For generations, the grail has protected this holy lineage
In preparation for one event --
The end of the world.
Only god knows exactly when, but it will be soon.
We have been assured from sources at the highest levels.
And the grail will be ready.
And at the exact moment that hope is abandoned,
Our savior will reveal himself to the frightened masses.
Ingenious.
The world on its knees,
Begging for direction like the ugly girl at a gang bang.
Your uniform.
Some of the men find it a bit...
Flamboyant.
It's...
Spectacular.
May i ask, what would be my specific role in all this?
The samson unit of the grail handles the false prophets,
Contenders to christ's throne.
Our job is to rid the world of their competing narratives.
Charlemagne.

You name it.
You...
Will be my right-hand man.
The grail killed abraham lincoln?
Mm.

And why did we do that?
He preserved the union, won the war, sense of humor.
His polling was probably through the roof.
Something tells me you're going to do great things here,
Herr starr.
Thank you for this opportunity.
[vehicle horns honking, screaming]
Blood, people!
Blood and brains
And people screaming until their lungs hurt.
That's how bad it's gonna be!
That is what's coming!
So...

I'm taking five.

Ah, father!
I noticed you standing there.
Always good to see a fellow soldier for the lord.
Question for you?
Hit me.
Are you crazy or just a con man?
And those are my only two choices?
'cause i normally describe myself as
A "left-handed alcoholic sinner child of god."
I didn't mean to insult you.
It's just, i've been wondering about the end of the world.
Well...
Buy me a beer.

Sorry again about the confusion.
Ever since the carts started operating in tandem,
You'd be surprised how much this happens.
Mm.

Alcohol and a lack of vital signs'll do it to ya every time.
Aw.

I'd rather be them than him.
Yeah.
Ten, nine, eight, seven...
Six, five, fo--
I'm real sorry about your boyfriend, ma'am.
Terrible loss.
Y'all should be sorry.
We robbed you assholes blind.
That wasn't my boyfriend.
And he wasn't dead.
We came in here, played y'all for the idiots y'all are...
Took your money, and drank your beer.
So put your goddamn hats back on.
And tell me which one of you banjo-diddling little bitches
Has got the balls to earn your money back.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four --
Again.
So.

Mm-hmm.
Why?

Common sense.

The world's been ending since it started.
That's not an answer.
What's the question?
What are you looking for?

Well, that's what you're advertising here, right?
"signs of the apocalypse" and all that?
Ah...
That's mostly just metaphor.
I hear things.

People come up to me, they say all sorts of crazy stuff.
And there has been an uptick ever since tom cruise exploded,
No question.
The cubs winning Trump, this -- this flying pig.
That's real wrath of god stuff, right?
But sooner or later, there's always an explanation --
Strong pitching, kgb interference, whatever.
In the end, there's always a good reason.
So you're just out here scaring people?

They're already scared.
They come listen to me talk about the end of the world
So they can worry about that instead of
What really scares them.
Which is what?
Themselves.
What is more frightening than who we are and what we done?
well, i have got car payments and a drinking problem,
So i should probably get back to it.
hey.
You hear about this whole fractional "soul-selling" thing?
The japanese, sure.
This parishioner came to me about it.
He's thinking about selling a small amount of his, you know.
And, of course, i said, "no way."
But this guy was in quite a tough situation.
Friends were in trouble, needed help.
Hmm.
So by selling off this small part of his soul --
And i mean, tiny, like one percent --
I thought...
Maybe it was a sacrifice worth making.
You know?
I would tell your parishioner
That if he wants to help his friends,
He should give a kidney.
And if you're looking for signs of the apocalypse,
I would start with men selling off their souls.
The situation has been handled.
Where to next?
New orleans, sir.
And the target?
Uh, a preacher.

I'm on my way.
the water was highly toxic.
I'msorry,butwould you mind explaining it again?
The water killed the whole village.
Made the pig float.
The water made the pig float?
How could contaminated water produce
Such an unusual effect?
It was saturated with hydrogen atoms.
Permeated the pig's tissue.
Resulted in limited levitation.
Like a meat balloon.
"meat balloon"?
Meat balloon.
It just seems so incredible.

Are you a scientist?
