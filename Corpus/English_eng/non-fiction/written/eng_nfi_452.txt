France has asylum after its arrest by the Syrian government.
Today works with the European Commission in the asylum of Syrian refugees.
What do you say to those who reproach Europe for being hypocritical?
I tell you that they are right.
But who are those who make us that reproach?
Where are they?
Who do they talk to?

Only the people we aspire to are not hypocritical.
One last question.
How do you see the future for your country, Syria?
I try to work for that is less gloomy.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
- We are late.

I have sent you your boarding pass.
His suitcase is in the taxi.

Rex is at the airport.
Rex gets on the plane.
Good.

From Brussels to Istanbul how long does it take?
- Three and a half hours. "Well, I'll be back in the afternoon."
Rex is on his way.
When did you stay with Shahanah?
Morning or past.

Are you going to tell me who I'm going to see?
It was to avoid leaks.
Can not negotiate Paul's release if it is not secret.
Shahanah?
It is in direct contact with the Islamic State.
Buy them works of art looted on the ground.
He is the biggest drug dealer right now.
He was a curator of the Damascus Museum.
It seems that he did not earn enough.
We know each other when I was teaching in college.
That's why we contacted her.
Shahanah is very suspicious.

Why would you help us free Paul?
For money.
To buy protection... when the defeat of the Islamic State.
Attention, please.
Keep your belt buckled... as we go through a zone of turbulence.
In order to avoid a crisis between France and the United States... we told you the name of your agent... that offered us their services .

Some of us are asking questions about what will happen... when Paul Lefebvre is released.
And we all hope it will be.
Knowing that it will be very difficult to hide it from the press.
What are they going to do?
How will they sanction it without being made public?
We will do what you do as usual.
Act first and think later.
According to statistics, a Western hostage of the Islamic State... has a 25% probability of living.
- And if it is an agent?

The return of Paul Lefebvre to France... would be a miracle.
The question is: do we believe in miracles?
This is the first time I suggest leaving an agent.
It is logical.

Malotru executed by the Daesh is a bargain for the Americans.
The scandal is avoided.

And ours too.
Once we release it, what do we do?
- We toast with champagne.

We think about it.
Time plays against us.
If we do not get it out soon, the Americans will bury it there.
Welcome to Istanbul Ataturk International Airport.
Passengers to Rome, go to gate 6 for boarding.
Attention, please.
Flight DL 8541, last call to board the door 14.
Last call for passengers Ms. Kiffel, Mr. Ouzoun, Mr. Bardaki.
Yes?
What are you doing?
I return to Brussels.
What happens?
That I also have a price.
For helping Paul?
For running a risk by visiting a dangerous drug dealer.
Okay, we'll talk tonight.
No, they announce things to me in the last moment to coerce me.
That's it.
What is over?
Do you want me to visit your man?
Then get me what I asked.

And what do you want?
When this is done, we will follow.
Thank you.
European Commission Organization chart
Do you want this position?
Attached to the commissioner of aid humanitarian and civil protection.
Why?
The curator, Amir Mamoun, is very well located... to direct the future transition government of Syria.
He wants to be near him.
- She is ambitious.

And what guarantees you get the position... when they have cast the current attachment?
She is a woman and the new quota policy is very favorable.
And it is Syria.
Why do we want to rescue at all costs to Malotru?
Why is it ours?
It is a mole.
And let the Daesh judge him?
Some people think so.
"Moule Ã  gaufres"?
In particular.
And you?
I thought he was going to become the kamikaze.
Either she wanted to die, but she failed or wanted to give herself a chance.
If I wanted to die, I would not have used such a directional explosive.
Then he wanted to give himself a chance.
An opportunity for what?
To live a hell?
The Indian Ocean has been the focus of a tremendous scientific effort.
The so-called Expedition International Indian Ocean 2.
For about 5 years... and under the auspices of the Unesco Oceanographic Commission...
This expedition has brought together fleets and oceanographic equipment...
The private sector has also supported this effort... providing your technology tip and experience... in seismic data collection depth.
... collected in the only subduction zone of the Indian Ocean,
Sunda's grave.
... the disasters of Indonesia and the surrounding countries.
Our work allows you to create images... the subduction plate....
Thus we will be able to understand the process of subduction.
Any questions?
Marina Loiseau, seismologist.
I worked at the IPPP of Paris and the IISR in Tehran.
And it seems to me that the subduction of Makran, south of Iran and Pakistan, is also affecting to the Indian Ocean... and shows a great prism of accretion.
Could we use the methods that have developed... to understand the transition between subduction and collision... or are tailor made for pure marine seismic data?
That's a very good question, you're right.
The Makran zone is a short subduction zone... in the widest area...
What do you do?

It's weird.
One of the Russians is not on our list.
They are down.

Do you think it can be a new or a fellow?
It's weird that we do not know anything about him.
Who tells you that she is Russian or that works in the Bulgakov institute?
Yes, you're right.
There?
- An interesting question.

You are the one who was working in Tehran, right?
Yes.
I have studied the Caspian Sea.
Good.
I introduce Claudia Senik, from the IPGP.
Hello.
I'm going to introduce myself too.
My name is Dimitri and these are my companions.
Vlad and Igor.
We are all from the Bulgakov Institute.
Of course, that explains the Caspian Sea.
Yes, marine seismology is our specialty.
Would you like to sit down with us?
Sorry.
Marina, are you there?
Marina?
Are you okay?
The third man is his FSB agent.
Maybe.

You yourself said that Bulgakov institute worked with the FSB.
Okay.
All right, all right.
Do you know that in Syria war causes storms of sand?
The exodus of northern agricultural populations, drying out of Euphrates by Turkey.
= The continuous tamping of the soil.

Giant sandstorms.
We will use the next to make an operation.
Do you know where Guillaume is?
With a favorable percentage.
It is risky, but it is now or never.
It is here, in an area where the Islamic State loses ground.
Is it a joint operation with the Americans?
No, with the Kurds.
Good...
Welcome to Beyadi.
The Peshmergas defeated here to the Islamic State.
Yes, I have been informed.
Here we wait for the sandstorm.
It is the nearest safe village to the place of detention of the hostage.
I will go with my men, we will and we will bring it to you.
- Is it going well?

Although I say it's safe,
Bearded people leave surprises when they lose a city.
Craft mines, explosives, corpses trap...

- Are you hungry?

We are not macho, we take turns.
Watch what you say.

I speak French.
What is it?
Do they record the fighting?
Age of Islamic State.
I look at it to understand how they fight.
Where did you find it?
They wanted to burn everything.
But down there it did not burn.
- Can we go down?

Question first.
Is everything here?
No.

Okay.
Where are you?
I think it's a barracks abandoned by the Daesh... before they got kicked out of town.
There are lots of files.
What luck.
- Are you in the dining room?

Well, now I send you more things.
- I let you work.

Are you alone in the office?
No.
Shit, then no I can get you horny.
You do not know what I want to have that my tongue gets for your...
To.
- I leave you.

If you move, it will explode.
Do not move.
Breathe slowly.
He had gone to look for this.
I told you not to move.
Why did you move?
Sorry.
This is not Disneyland.
It's a cemetery everywhere.
- I am not your nanny.

We are the Kurds who we have liberated the city.
If we do not love you more, if you do dangerous things or nonsense,
We'll throw you out and no-one will say no, okay? Okay.
Thank you.
I do not understand those who shit in the bathroom.
Do not they have a bathroom in their house?
Do not shit at work.
Why do not they bathe too?
Every time I go to the bathroom, it sucks.
And when I leave, someone enters and thinks that it was me.
Why?

If I was not fat, they would not say anything.
But the fat guys shit.
It is known that the fat spend the day shitting.
Come and see.
Raymond?
I am going to ask to go because it is very important.
What is this?
I do not know.

It is not in Arabic.
It looks like a scheme of railroad diversions.
Oh, yes?
French.
Do you send it to me?
Is he dead?
Not at all.
We know your father is in good health.
And we know where it is.
Good.
The President has authorized an operation to release it.
Parallel to our willingness to negotiate, of course.
That is why we have made you come.
And when is it?
I can not respond with accuracy, but soon.
Hours, days, weeks?
Days.
Good.
- Can I tell my mother?

Yes, I know the house.
Good morning.
Awesome, Melody.
Thank you all for coming.
I announce that the next congress will be in Barcelona.
And now, as the last number of the night,
I present an expert of the tectonics of the mind.
David Saurin, a hypnotist.

- Do not you like hypnotists?

I have not seen you tonight.
You have not come to dinner, have you?
No, there has been an earthquake in Bushehr, in Iran.
- Have not you heard?

- When has it been?

Are you no longer aware of the situation there?
Yes, but not 24 hours, especially during the congress.
I understand.
How long have you been in Iran?

Was not it very hard?

No.
And you?
I am the son of the soviets, you know.
- Have you ever been to Russia?

So why do you want to work at Bulgakov?
I asked one of your colleagues and I have not yet said yes, but the proposal seems very interesting.
- Have you considered this before?

But you are not expert in submarine seismology.
Why do you say that?
It is what I understand.
Where did you study that subject?
In the Institute of Earth Physics of Paris?
The IPGP?
I will tell you one thing.
I do not accept job interviews in bars.
And never without a formal appointment.
- Sorry, sorry.

If you forgive me, please.
- Yes?

When I returned from Iran, was my ticket in order?
Of course.
What line was it?
Lufthansa.
What about my end-of-contract notification?
In order.
- And my...

But if someone ever checks it...
-  It's all rechecked 10 times.

I received a rare call from Marina Loiseau.
- Is something wrong? "Nothing at all."
You have used an emergency procedure.
I thought something was wrong and no.

She was nervous.
Thank you.
I came to look for material.
Proof.
Not bad.
What happens to your leg?
I have walked too much.
Silicone.
A mine?
A saber.
We leave in 20 minutes.
- I will be ready.

Fuck you.
No, it's not necessary, do not move.
Is it tonight?
Yes.
Keep me a plate.
Good.
And another for your friend.
See you later.
It's an old trick, but helps me to concentrate.
What is that?
The Cham's army.
The car can not pass.

Beware, we have almost arrived, so no noise.
The pastor can be close.

Move them carefully to the side.
= Ale, ale, come on, out.
Come on, ale, ale, out.
Fuck, what needs to be done.
Almost there.
I'm going to help you.
Mines.
Go back slowly and look where you step.
The noise has caused to alert the fighters.
You have to go faster.
A sheep.
Continue.
What are you going to do?
It is very long to count.
The irresistible promotion?
Why not?
What if in the meantime they had executed Paul?
Did he raise it when I was in captivity?
Tell me.
We found this... in the village of Beyadi abandoned by those of the Islamic State.
What is it?
It is a scheme of detours of the French trains.
- Is there a station in Beyadi?

Good.
Is it... a code of the railway of the French resistance... to communicate during the occupation.
They used deviation schemes.
In 1980, the DGSE had a top... in the secret services of Saddam Hussein.
And communicated with him with those coded schemes.
The pseudonym was Cochise.

Follow.
What if Cochise were now... an official of high rank of the Islamic State... and would have reactivated the code to contact us?
There are many charges of Islamic State... that come from the old party Baas of Saddam Hussein.
And left us this to that we find it?
It would be a way to wake up our interest without taking risks.
If not, I do not know what did that there.
In that case, you would have to respond.
We would need a channel for that.
We already have one.
Marina, I'll ask you a question, only once.
And we will not talk about it any more.
You should stay in an office after what happened in Iran.
I was bored.
I proposed an observation mission within the Bulgakov institute.
He thought that the seismologists of the institute... worked safely on submarine communication cables.
He convinced me.

Was I wrong?
No.
You can tell me.

You can tell me that you are afraid.
That has not yet recovered from the last mission.
You must tell me.
Because this time she is not alone.
I promise you everything is going well and you did not go wrong.
Well, you can go to Moscow with Claudia.
Very good.

I go to the bathroom, okay?
- Do you have your boarding pass?

Last call for passengers Mr. and Mrs. Ipaniev,
Mr. Oreva, Ms. Chenova.
Please go immediately to door M48.
Turn off your mobile phone, please.

= No, no, no, no.
