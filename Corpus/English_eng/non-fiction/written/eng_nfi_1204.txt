Hello.

My name is Tyler McCarthy.
I have some very important information... about a murder.
OK.
- The murder of Julie Matlock.

Editor of the Saint Marie Times?

I know.

Julie Matlock was murdered and Nadine Hunter was convicted for it.
But the thing is -

She was with me that night, I swear to you.
You got the wrong person.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad!
- Did you call me?

Oh, I was just looking for a hammer and some nails, and I discovered this place.

Yeah, fantastic(!

Well, I'm throwing it out.

- if I'm going to get a bed in here.

My back's not made for a hammock.
Ah, Florence.

I'm good, sir.

No, not in the slightest.
The Commissioner asked me to come and see you.
We were hoping we could maybe borrow you.
- Borrow me?

Well, it's more of an old case, but...
- I'll explain on the way.

Well, always happy to oblige.
- Suppose I'd better smarten myself up.

Good point.
Eight years ago, I was on vacation here with my girlfriend.
It was our last night, we had a big argument.
Ended with both of us storming off.

'I just fell into the nearest bar there was -- 'that's where I met Nadine.'
Happy Saint Ursula's day.
Neither of us were in a great place.

One thing led to another...
You spent the night together?
Yeah.
When I woke up the next morning, she had left.

And at the time, you weren't aware of the coverage of the murder?
You hadn't read the newspapers or seen the news?
I had no idea Nadine was arrested for murder.
And how did you find out now?
My marriage recently ended.
Sorry.

I know.

These last few months...
I keep thinking about that night here on the island.
About Nadine.

And that's when you found out what had happened?
She died in prison -- pneumonia -- two years into her sentence.
She didn't deserve that, any of it.
She was innocent.
So, what do you think, sir?

No reason to make it up, as far as I can tell.
- Nothing to gain from it.

He also fits the description Nadine Hunter gave of the man she claimed she spent the night with.
So what do we do now?
I don't think there's a choice, Florence.
You -- or should I say we -- reopen the case.
So, this is Nadine Hunter.
And this is Julie Matlock -- the woman she was accused of killing.
We never found her body.
- You remember the case, Dwayne?

It was when DI Charlie Hulme was here.
Julie Matlock was editor of the Saint Marie Times and quite a respected figure on the island.
And what was her relationship to Nadine Hunter?
Nadine worked under Julie at the paper, she was a photographer,
- but there were definite tensions between them.

Well, you see, Miss Hunter was a little bit unstable.
Dependent on alcohol and anti-depressants.
- Not a great mix at the best of times.

Well, the night before the murder, they had a very public falling out.
Julie had suspended Nadine from her job until she agreed to accept professional help.
- And that's why she was suspected of killing Julie Matlock?

Plus...

When we searched her flat, there was no sign of the weapon.
And-and her car was missing, too.
We fished that out of the bay the following day.
We found the gun in the boot, along with this --
Julie Matlock's bloodied scarf.
Now, the court didn't have a body but they had means, motive and, because she couldn't prove her alibi, opportunity.
What's this?
That's one of the reasons I can still remember the case.
- It's creepy.

On the night it happened,
Julie Matlock was working late at the newspaper offices.
At 8:15pm, she phoned her daughter from her mobile and started leaving an answer-phone message.

'Hi, Gracey.
'Look, I know I said we should do dinner but guess what?

Good Lord.
The newspaper office, where it happened, is it still there?
Oh, yes.
So, all the staff are waiting downstairs, if you need to talk to any of them.
Great.

What exactly happened here on the night of June the 22nd, 2009?
On the afternoon of the murder,
Julie Matlock's colleagues left at around 4:30.
We've had a hell of a day.

I'll stay here and finish up.
So there was no-one else here, apart from Julie, until whoever did it turned up at some point and shot her at 8:15pm.
So, where was she when it happened?
According to the files, forensics found significant traces of bleach on and around her desk and chair, suggesting it was cleaned after the murder.
Yes, and, erm, Julie's desk was that one over there.
She was sitting here, working away, doing whatever editors do, when she decided to phone her daughter and say she wasn't going to make it to dinner.
Any evidence to suggest where the gun was fired from?
Not that I can find.

And without the body, it's...
We don't know where the fatal bullet entered.

Could you just excuse me one moment?
What's he doing?
That's interesting.
You think you know where the gun was fired from?
Oh, haven't a clue, Florence.
I'd say it's about 100% impossible to tell.

Yes, sir.
There was a fire door downstairs found open on the night.
Leads onto the car park.
It was assumed that the killer used the lift to get the body down there.
So, whoever did it was familiar with the layout of the building.
And they'd have needed a key to get in.

Yes, sir, the initial investigation concluded that it must have been one of the other employees here at the newspaper.
So, who else had a key to the building?
Well, apart from the security, only the other members of the senior editorial team.
And who exactly were they?
Julie's husband, Ian Matlock, her daughter, Grace, and journalists Tony Garrett and Kai Johnson.
It's the same team still working here.
There's just one thing.
Part of the reason the original investigation focused in on
Nadine Hunter was because she was the only one who couldn't prove where she was on the night of the murder, whereas these four all had rock solid alibis.
Of course they did.

Look, I know this is very upsetting for you all.
It's just...

So, if we could just have a little chat,
I'm sure we can clear everything up once and for all.
Right.

She more or less threw us out after Nadine Hunter turned up.
Nadine?
I'm here for my stuff.
- We can send your things on...

We're not finished!
She's totally lost it.
The evening before, you were dining at the... at The Blue Orchid.
She showed up, she was out of her head.
I know what you're doing!

Let me go!
And she was so angry because Julie had suspended her from her job,
- is that correct?

She was... a damaged soul.
Dad, how can you still stick up for her?
Does anyone have any idea why she was so down in the dumps or, you know, so fond of the old drink?
Wasn't there something about a guy who broke her heart years ago or something?

Who cares?
Mum was a good friend to her.
She was an ungrateful bitch.
I think Nadine thought Julie wanted to get rid of her, whereas the fact is...
She just wanted her to get professional help -- that's why she suspended her.
Let's be honest -- none of us could work with her any more.
So, next evening, night of the murder.
Miss Matlock, your mother phoned and left that message.
I take it you were out that evening.
No, I was there but I was in the shower.
I was at the house, too.

Grace played it when she came out the shower.
'Hi, Gracey.

'I'm still at the office.
'I'm probably going to be here another...'
'I phoned dad straight away.'
Dad?

'I was up at our beach house.
'I phoned you lot straight away and got into the car.'
And this beach house, is it nearby?
- About 40 minutes by car.

OK.

So, night of the murder, Grace and Kai,
- you were together at home and, Ian, you were at the beach house?

Mr Garrett, Tony, where were you that evening at about 8:15pm?
It was festival night.
I was in Denny's bar, along with half of Honore.
Read the statements!

"We're not finished" -- that's what she said, straight to her face.
Remember?
Whoever this man is and whatever he says,
Nadine Hunter killed my mother.
OK, well, thank you all.
Ah, JP, could you get your hands on some hi-fi equipment?
The best you can find -- external speakers, the whole works.
Let's see if there's any more background noises on that voice message, you know, the killer entering the room, footsteps, that sort of thing.
Yeah, OK.

Brilliant, thanks!
- Commissioner.

- Inspector, you answered the call to arms, I see.

If for no other reason than to get out from under my daughter's feet.
Well, whatever the reason, I'm glad you're here.
This is rather a delicate matter.
Yes, I suppose it is a bit.
You think there's any substance to what this man says?
Well, I think we should proceed as though there is... until we manage to talk ourselves out of it.
You seem worried, Commissioner.
- I reckon I would be, too, if I was in your shoes.

Erm, well, no, just if the verdict proved to be unsafe, well, wouldn't reflect brilliantly on your department now, would it?
But I've had a brief look through the case files and, from what
I've seen, Charlie Hulme was a good detective, very thorough.
So if a mistake was made, then I'm sure it wasn't due to negligence or lack of effort.
Keep me in the loop, Inspector.
Absolutely.
- Pep talk?

'.. but guess what?

'I'm probably going to be here another...'
Something there, isn't there?

'.. but guess what?

'I'm probably going to be here another...'
Yes, it's like, erm, a rumble.
JP, do you think you could isolate that sound?
- Oh, er, I could call my cousin, he might be able to.

You got something there, Dwayne?
Well, Nadine Hunter didn't have any next of kin, so the prison authorities sent over all her possessions to us when she died.
Clothes.
Leonard Cohen CD.
Copy of Wuthering Heights.
What's this?
- Lock of hair?

- Did she have children?

Maybe it belongs to her college sweetheart?
It's a bit weird, isn't it?

Mmm.

To this day, she's holding on to a pair of his socks he left behind, like there's a chance he'll come back for them.
Maybe Nadine was just a hopeless romantic.
Maybe.
OK.

Julie Matlock, 47, met husband Ian at Manchester University, where they edited the student paper.
They settled in Saint Marie 18 years ago.

They were close to finishing a beach house on the coast when Mrs Matlock was murdered.

Kai Johnson, 35.
Oh, we looked at him very closely.

Assault.

They put him in a youth rehabilitation programme and got him an apprenticeship at the newspaper.
Looks like he turned his life around and bagged the boss' daughter.
Grace Matlock, 30.

Not the high achiever her mum was, struggled at school, didn't go to university.
Only ever worked for her parents as a copy editor.
So, husband, daughter and her boyfriend.

Well, he's been at the paper for years, way before the Matlock's even took it over.
Right.

Likes a party, but a decent enough guy.
Then there's the original prime suspect, Nadine Hunter, who now, out of the blue, has an alibi for the night of the murder.
Well, look, I don't think we're going to achieve much more tonight.
Why don't we call it a day?
- Gets my vote.

You are aware of the visiting Inspector rule, right?
Er, not sure that I am Dwayne, no.
It's an old Saint Marie tradition.
You see, when an Inspector visits from another region, he takes us all to the nearest bar and buys us a drink.
- That wouldn't be a rule you've just made up yourself now, would it?

I might've made it up a little, but Catherine's bar at the end of a hard day is a bit of a tradition.
A very civilised tradition, if I may say so.
And here's the lady herself.
Catherine, meet Inspector Jack Mooney from the UK.
- Lovely to meet you.

- Are you visiting the island?

He's helping us out.
Oh, and...

Well, there's the little matter of the election first.
I'll get your drinks.
- So, this festival I keep hearing about.

Which Saint Ursula is it?

There was one who was martyred by the Huns.
The poor girl, she got it in the neck -- literally.
And then there's Saint Ursula Micaela Morata - she actually had the gift of bilocation.

Yeah, the ability to be in two places at once.

The one where you drink a lot of rum and party wildly in the street.
Ah, I like her the best.
Thought I'd find you in the nearest bar.
Ah, Siobhan, come and join us.
Catherine, this is my daughter Siobhan.
Welcome!

Well, one won't hurt, I suppose.
Oh!

This is how it all starts.
One!

Cheers, sir.
Oh, thank you.
You know what we need?
More willpower?
A grown-up.
Wouldn't hurt.
Remember when you were little?

- you wouldn't let me close your bedroom curtains.

And on cloudy nights I used to tell you there were no stars because the batteries had run out.
Backfired a bit on me there!

And you said that they were the wrong size batteries.
So I did.
- Sorry about that.

Mum got me the glow in the dark ones to stick on the window.
Ah.
Just like your mum, tidying up after my mess.
I really miss her.
I know you do, love.
Me, too.
Thanks a million.

What's going on?
I bought a bed.

- When did you organise that?

I mentioned it to Dwayne, who said he knew a man who knew a man whose auntie might be able to help.

Now all I need is a pillow and some sheets and I'm right as rain.
Er, mattress?
Oh, yeah, a mattress.
I might have to have another word with Dwayne.
She left the offices there...

When did she go, when did she go to Port Royal?

Who's he talking to?
Why did she, why did she do that?
OK, then she stayed...
Sir?

Me?

What about yourself, Florence?

Only this.

"1-9-8-7-1".
It's hardly a phone number, not enough digits.
It's not a pin number, either.
I'll see if I can find something else it could relate to.
- Sir?

There's something here in Julie's inbox.

"Dear Julie, while I still stand by the articles, I regret that
"in certain respects my behaviour may have fallen
"short of your expectations.
"I therefore have no option but to tender my resignation.
"Yours, Tony Garret."
The classic non-apology apology.

I'll keep going back.
Let me see if I can find out what these articles were about.
Might be worth paying a visit to the paper.

Dwayne, how you getting on with financial checks?
The original investigation only focused on the victim's finances -- oh, and Nadine Hunter's - so I started to look into the other four suspects.

And Ian Matlock's credit card statements make for interesting reading.
In the two months before Julie's death, there's two -- no, three -- payments to somewhere called Cupid's Arrow.
Cupid's Arrow?
Yes, that's a high-end lingerie shop on the other side of the island.
So I hear.
Then we have afternoon champagne at the Bay Cove Hotel and a payment to the florists every day for a month.
- Spoiling his wife, eh?

Present company excepted.
And what about the afternoon champagne?
Julie Matlock was a workaholic.
If you ask me, it wasn't his wife.
- Wasn't there an insurance payout?

Florence, looks like you and I need to pay Ian Matlock a visit.
Sorry about the weather, sir.
Reminds me of home.
Ooh, this is some house they built for themselves.
So, you need clarification on something?
Yes, Ian, that's exactly what we need -- a bit of clarification.
Now, what was it needed clarifying?
Ah, yes.

Can you tell us what you were doing at the Bay Cove hotel on May 18th and again on the 3rd of June 2009, shortly before your wife was murdered?
There's lots of other dates, but we'll start with those two for now.
Er, the...
The Bay Cove Hotel?
Yeah.
Would you like the dates again?
I suspect you know damn well what I was doing.
I have no way of knowing what you were doing, Mr Matlock.
Locking yourself away in a hotel room with champagne and sexy lingerie all afternoon could mean lots of different things.
I'm sorry.

You were having an affair?
Even the most perfect of marriages get into a rut.
Although, if I'm honest, it wasn't my marriage in a rut,
- it was me.

- Can I ask, who was it you were seeing?

.. I was vain and stupid and I wanted to feel like the big man.
- And did your wife ever find out?

It was a few months that summer.

It had nothing to do with my wife's death, I swear.
You know, I was still at college in 2009.
Me, I was getting my heart broken.
You?

You better believe it!

Monica Cannon.

Kind, sweet, looked like a model.
- So what happened?

Why?
It was nothing.
I can't even remember.
OK, there was a slight height issue.
She was taller than me, a lot taller!
You dumped her just for that?

There were people looking and laughing!
Ah!
Here we go, look --
"Tony Garret Investigates."
"Allegations Rock Calder Hill Private School".
What's the date on that?
May 4th, 2009.
May 4th, 2009.
It carries on the following week.
You know, I remember this, JP.

- with some of his older students.

You think this could be the article that Tony Garret was talking about
- in his resignation letter?

I think I'll call the Inspector.
Caught with a rum and coconut water at 5:00pm.
Guilty as charged!
But then, if every police officer looked like you...
I wouldn't mind being arrested.
Unfortunately, Tony, most police officers look like me.
To what do I owe the honour?
- Calder Hill.

That's the one.

Oh, yes -

Quite a series of articles.
Were you sure those girls were telling you the truth?
The truth has many faces.
I still had to investigate.
Ah, we read them, the articles, they were excellent.
But not an awful lot of evidence.

I talked to a lot of people, that guy was crossing the line.
- So you didn't get it wrong?

Hm.

Julie accused me of embellishing the truth.
.. because you're lazy.

It's over for you, Tony.
After all we'd been through, she should have stuck by me.
- Must have stung a bit, though.

And, two days later, Julie is dead and your resignation withdrawn.
- You think I killed her?

If I remember rightly, you were in the bar all night.
Yes, I was.

Oh, there's no need for that, Tony, no need at all.
No, we're just tidying things up here a bit, keep the powers that be happy.
Whatever the rights and wrongs of that investigation,
Nadine Hunter killed Julie.
End of story.
OK!
Rum and coconut water.

Sure.
Never came across that before.
You should try it.
Not on duty!

Ian Matlock, Tony Garret -- both had motives.
Yes, but Tony Garret had a bar full of witnesses who all said he was there at 8:15 -- the same time Julie Matlock got shot.
Well, the same goes for Ian Matlock.
There's records of a call made from Grace's home phone and answered on Ian's landline at the beach house at 8:16 pm.
Well, the beach house was a 40-minute drive from the newspaper office where Julie was shot.
Neither Ian or Tony were anywhere near the scene of the crime
- when it happened.

But if Nadine Hunter's innocent, it must be one of them, it simply must be.
Er, sir, that's my cousin Eddie, he's found a bit of kit to isolate the sound on that CD.
- I'll head over there now.

Oh, you found her!

What you doin' sneaking up on me, man?
Found who?
Oh, Dwayne's reconnecting with an old flame.
- He had a bit of a thing with her in 2009.

They didn't see eye to eye.
You think you're funny?
Hello?
Ah, Mr McCarthy.

I was just wondering if there'd been any developments.
Only, I'm leaving in a day.
We're progressing.
So you haven't found anything, then?
Well, there's an awful lot to get through -- forensic reports, statements, physical evidence.
- The fact that it all happened eight years ago doesn't help.

Must've been quite a night -- to bring you back here after all these years.
It was.

I don't know what I'm doing.
My marriage falls apart and the first thing I do is hop on a plane, chasing some one night stand from years ago.
My father always told me you never really know what you're looking for until you find it.
5,000 miles is a long way to go if you don't know what you're looking for.
Well, look, if we manage to prove Nadine's innocence and arrest whoever did commit that murder, well, then I'd say your trip hasn't been wasted.
- Goodnight, Inspector.

So, whoever did this let themselves into the building and then shot Julie while she was on the phone leaving a message for her daughter.
We know they then removed all signs of the killing, cleaned up the crime scene and disposed of the body.
Where that body is is something we don't know.
We also know that Nadine Hunter's car was pushed into the sea and, when it was recovered, all that we could find was the potential murder weapon and the victim's bloodied scarf, which would indicate that whoever did this was trying to frame
Nadine Hunter for the murder.
Ahh!
Which begs the question, why her?
Why kill Julie Matlock and then frame Nadine for it?
Maybe, somehow, they knew Nadine would struggle to prove her alibi?
Maybe.
But now that's no longer the case, the playing field has been levelled, leaving us with four people, all of whom might have done it.
But they can all prove they were somewhere else at the time that Julie was killed.
Sir?

And?

Well, listen.
What is that?
Personally, I think it sounds like something mechanical.
Or someone tapping?
- No, no, no, no, no, -- it's a horse!

Yes.

You can't hear it?
Listen!
And that's as loud as your cousin can get it?
- He can't bring it out any more?

OK.

This timeline.

- Yes.

And we know that Julie Matlock was there for a short time
- the day she was murdered.

A taxi driver gave a statement that he took Julie to Port Royal, she asked him to wait for her, he said it was about 15 minutes, then he drove her back to her office.
- Did we ever establish what she was doing there?

OK.
Look, I know it's a long time ago, but it's about the only thing we haven't double-checked.
Why don't we go there and we'll talk to whoever we can find, OK?
Right.

- Hello!

- Have you seen this woman before?

I really don't know anything about it.
- Come on.

Let's go.
- Sir?

Nothing.

Safety deposit box?
1-9-8-7-1 -- the five-digit code.
It's this way, sir.
He didn't recognise Julie Matlock's photograph, but he's checked his files and the box was registered in her name.
1-9-8-7-1.
Bingo.
Pictures... and a comp slip.
"Maxwell Private Detectives".
This is Kai, her daughter's boyfriend.
And who are these clowns he's hanging out with?
She had me followed?
She didn't believe that you were a reformed character.
- She was looking for proof -- looks like she found it.

Wouldn't look good to Grace if she knew you were still hanging around
- with those fellas.

Our point is, Kai, if you knew about this, you had a powerful motive to kill Julie.
Of course I knew Julie was trying to get rid of me -- she begged Grace to dump me, she was desperate.
She even tried to pay me off.
That was the real Julie.
She may have banged on about getting people out of the gutter, until a piece of gutter trash got anywhere near her or Grace.
Did you tell Grace that Julie tried to buy you off?
Yes, and she was furious.
The night she died,
Grace was supposed to have dinner with her mum, sort things out.
- But you're saying you didn't know you were being followed?

You were dealing, though?
One time.

I was up to my neck in debt and I did what I had to.
One deal to get away from it for good.
And you definitely didn't know about these pictures?
Of course I didn't!
Wait!

I love Grace.

'Honore Police.'
Dwayne, how are ya?

No, not Kai's.

- But there was another set of prints on there.

Grace Matlock.
When did you first see them?
Your fingerprints are all over them.
She showed them to me the day before she died.
I couldn't believe she did something like that.
But, then again, she was like a dog with a bone when she wanted something.
All my life she tried to force me into things, tell me what to do, make decisions for me.
I'd had enough.
I'm telling you, Gracey, he'll never change.

Told her I didn't care.

But she knew that if she gave them to the police, got him into trouble, she'd lose me forever.
- Never speak to her again.

No.

You think I want to admit my own mother would do something like this?
- Well, didn't you want to warn him?

Let's just say I made it clear that if I ever caught him dealing
I'd leave him.

And it paid off.

We make each other happy, we're about to have a baby.
Mum may have had these photos, but she couldn't do anything with them.
She knew it.
Why are you so cheerful?
Am I?
You got in touch with Monica Cannon, haven't you?
Of course.

That's great news, Dwayne, man!
So when are you going to meet her?
Who said I was?
Tonight at the festival.
You alright, sir?
Yes.

Yeah.
But maybe we should just go over it one last time.
A woman was shot dead in her office.
Her body was never found.
There are five suspects -- one of them was wrongly convicted of her murder -- which leaves four.
What do we know about these four people?
- They all had motives.

- They all had access.

What's that music?
- That's the festival, you know, Saint Ursula's.

They sound like they're having a lot more fun than we are.
Maybe we should call it a day.

- and... you are still on holiday, remember?

Maybe a bit of breathing space would do us the world of good.
- Welcome to Saint Marie, sir!

- And Happy Saint Ursula's Day to you both.

Ay-ay-ay!
Wow!
Smells like an aftershave factory.
You think it's too much?
- No.

Oh, good!
There she is.

Wish me luck.
I thought you said this woman was taller than Dwayne.
That's what he said.
Then who's that?
It's a long time since they last met.
Maybe Monica's shrunk a little bit.
What happened with Monica?
I can't believe I mixed them up!
Monica Ridley is the model, the one taller than me.
And the other one is Monica Cannon, whose father was in the circus.
- Circus?

Or a short one!
I wonder what Saint Ursula would have made of all this.
- What?

No, thanks, sir -

You enjoying yourself, Dad?
- Yeah!

- They could turn the music down a bit, though.

- The music -- it's very loud.

Loud!
Loud!

Good Lord!
Something there, isn't there, in the background?
Forensics found significant traces of bleach on and around her desk and chair.
A lock of hair?
What is it?

That's it!

- Got what?

JP, we need to run a DNA test.
- Dwayne!

- Fire service might have one.

We'll wake up whoever we need to.

- Ooh, Siobhan...

- You OK, sir?

Oh, good(!

Question -- how many saints are there in the Catholic Church?
- Go on, have a guess.

10,221 -- at the last count.
There's so many of them it's hard to tell who's who any more.
Take yesterday -

There's at least two that I know about -- the one who was martyred by the Hun and the other one who had the gift of bilocation.
Sorry, but have we come here for a theology lesson?
No, sorry, Tony, not at all.
We're here because the killer of Julie Matlock also had the gift of bilocation.
They were in two places at once.
See, there are two victims in this case.
There's Julie Matlock, demanding editor, fiercely-protective mother, domineering wife.
And there was also Nadine Hunter, charismatic but haunted woman, born under an unlucky star.
Depression, alcoholism, a college sweetheart buried in the past.
And then, to cap it all off, she's convicted for a murder she did not commit.
- Did not?

I believe that Nadine Hunter is innocent of the crime.
But what do we know about the real killer, whoever that might be?
What do we know about them?
Well, for a start, they had a key to this building.
And they also knew that Julie was working late the evening she disappeared.
In other words -- it had to be one of you.
- Come on.

No, no, despite the protestations, you all had motives.
But -- and here's the thing -- all of you can prove beyond doubt that you were not in this building at 8:15pm on Thursday the 22nd of June, 2009 --

We're here because I want to play you something.
This is the background noise on the message that Julie left on Grace's answer-phone.
If you could just listen for a moment.
Hmm.

Or someone tapping.
Now, just leaving aside what you do hear.

What you don't hear is music and singing and thousands of people out in the streets celebrating Saint Ursula.
The carnival passes right along this street here.
It's so loud my ears are still ringing from last night, yet there are no carnival sounds here.
See?

I'm sorry, you've lost me now.
My apologies, Ian.

It's true that none of you were here on that fateful evening.
- But then here's the thing -- neither was Julie.

Well, this is what I couldn't quite get.
Our killer, who was under such extraordinary time pressure, decided to clean up after themselves, lugging a dead weight down the corridor and into the lift, and then waiting for an opportune moment to drag the body outside
and put it in the boot of a car.
Why would they do that?
I was thinking about this for ages.
It wasn't until I realised what it was you COULDN'T hear on the background noises -- the carnival -- and then it suddenly twigged.
It was like bingo!
The killer wanted us to think that Julie was killed here,
- but she wasn't.

Well, to give themselves an alibi.
It was a stroke of genius.
Hold on.

Mum says she's in the office.
That's another example of the killer's genius.
We're dealing with a very creative individual here.
But, unfortunately for them, they made one tiny little mistake.
That sound on the answer-phone message gives them away.
Trust me, we spent an awful lot of time trying to figure out what that was.

We went through the whole shoot and shebang, rumbles and mechanical sounds -- a horse even made an appearance.
It rang a distant bell with me but I couldn't quite place it.
My dad was very good with his hands.
When I was about ten, he built an extension onto our house.
My granny had come to live with us and my sister, she couldn't carry on sleeping on the couch forever now, could she?
Anyway, to cut a long story short,
I used to help him out at the weekends and I remember shovelling cement into a mixer.
And that's what that sound is -- a cement mixer.
Now, where would Julie be anywhere near a cement mixer?
They were close to finishing a beach house on the coast when Mrs Matlock was murdered.
At the beach house... .. the one you'd been building yourselves,
- which is where you shot her.

The exact movements of yourself and Julie on that evening will only ever be known by you.
But one thing's for sure, when Julie was done at work, you picked her up from the office.
But not before you manufactured some excuse to slip back in here and wipe down that desk with bleach -- to make it appear as if somebody had cleaned up after a murder.
In the absence of the police finding a body, well, this was the next best thing.
You then drove back to the beach house... where you persuaded Julie to cancel her dinner date with Grace.
I imagine it was something along the lines of,
"Give her more space," or, you know,
"The more you push her the more you'll drive her away,"
that sort of thing.

Just tell her you're still at work.
So Julie picks up the phone and you wait while she tells Grace this lie about where she is.
Hi, Gracey.

I'm still at the office, probably going to be here another...
This is just mad.
Dad?

This makes no sense.
Why would I do any of this?
Well, you told us yourself that your marriage had got into a bit of a rut.
Although, if I'm honest, it wasn't my marriage in a rut, it was me.
The fact that you were having an affair, it makes me think it was more than that.
You were unhappy, an unhappy man, fed up with your marriage to Julie, and that's why you strayed.
But this summer fling you had, it wasn't with some travel rep whose name you can't recall.
No.
It was Nadine Hunter.
But for Nadine, it wasn't just a fling.
She was head over heels in love with you.
And for a woman like Nadine, love is all-consuming, intense, extreme.
She kept this lock of hair in her prison cell.
It was one of the few things she had.
We were wondering whether she had a child, or was it her college sweetheart's?
And then the penny dropped and we ran a DNA test.
It's yours, Ian.

But of course you didn't feel the same way about Nadine.
She was erratic and unstable -- more so now that she was in love.
So when she stormed into the restaurant that you and Julie were at...
I know what you're doing!

.. you ushered her out of there, out of the restaurant.
She's emotional, she's in no fit state to drive.
And that's probably when you got a hold of the car keys.
You get her into a cab.
It's unsettling, but maybe you're thinking she'll calm down, she might sober up and realise it's all over between you.
But she came to the office the next day.
We're not finished!
See, everybody thought she was talking to Julie, but it was you she was speaking to.
You knew you had to do something.
If the truth about you and Nadine came out... well, that was it.
Julie was not a woman to cross.
You'd literally be left with nothing -- no house, no fancy motorbike.
You had to think quickly.
You knew where Nadine's car was.
You also knew she kept a gun in her car.
So, after the murder... you place the weapon and Julie's bloodied scarf in Nadine's car before pushing it into the sea.
You saw your problem with Nadine as an opportunity, an opportunity to bring to an end your unhappy marriage and also to get rid of the mistress you'd lost interest in... .. leaving you to continue living in the manner
to which you'd grown accustomed.
All you had to do was get rid of the two women in your life,
Julie and Nadine.
Kill one and frame the other.
Everything you've just said is based on conjecture and circumstantial evidence.
Ah... no.
Not strictly true.
These are scans that we just ran of the foundations of your house and grounds.
And underneath the veranda of the house you and she built lies the body of Julie Matlock.
Quite literally concrete proof.
Say it's not true.
Dad!
Dwayne, JP, can you please do the honours?
Good work, Inspector.
Well done, sir.

We did it.
So... whatever happened to, er, Monica Ridley?
Who, her?

- Married with four kids.

Ah, well.

You're not funny, you know.
Maybe she just wasn't the one!
I'll get over it.
That didn't take long.
Hmm.

Ah!
- So, you solved your first case on Saint Marie.

Look who I found on the way -- a charming young lady.
I hear you solved the case.

Ah, no, no.

Congratulations, Inspector Mooney.
Very tenacious work.
Yeah, well, I can be quite tenacious, if I may say so.
You have to be when you're a parent.
Creeping in from the festival at four o'clock this morning.
- She thinks I don't know.

So you see, Commissioner, tenacity -- minimum requirement in our house.
You called it "our house" -- the shack.
It's a figure of speech.
You will be staying a little longer though, won't you?
Why is everyone looking at me?
Drinks for everyone!
About time!
Cheers.

I hope I can count on your vote today.
Who else would I vote for, huh?
Mayoral candidate Victor Pearce was casting his vote when one of these suspects managed to stick a knife in his back.
That only leaves one person -

Siobhan!
- That lizard's back!

Maybe someone should level the playing field.
- There's something I really need to go and do first.

Catch a killer.
