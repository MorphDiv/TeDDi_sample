Ma!
You okay?
You ready?
John, this depo from Chelsea changes everything.
That doesn't make sense for Meg.
She's had no history of domestic violence or abuse.
She's gonna be characterized as the angry ex for whatever reason their engagement fell off.
So, it's gonna devolve into a "he said, she said."
But we're missing the "she said" part.
Of course, her DNA is gonna be found at Marco's.
But she left the day after the man was murdered.
And Chelsea's placed her at the scene with motive.
You really have no idea where she is?
No, I don't.
- That doesn't seem weird to you?

What about Kevin?

Your brother's gonna have to hit it out of the park.
Frankly, I'm concerned.
He seems a little unstable.
My brother's gonna do just fine.
Yeah... he better.
Hi there, Mrs. Rayburn.
May I help you?
Yeah, well, you know, we've...

Oh, I'm sorry.

You're Mr. Del...?
- Delveccio.

How can I help you?
I know...

I...

I should have brought you flowers, and you're right.
I should have, but I...

I'm...

You know, now's not a...

Tiger lilies.
Right?

'Cause I'm worried about you, Sally.
I am.

Information is just...
It's coming in all the time.
I, uh...

Oh, no, no, no.
Look, I don't...

But I've seen you, Sally.
I...

You're just not well.
You're not even breathing.
- What?

- You need to go.

I'm not here to hurt you.

Please, I...

Whatever you know, whatever you've done, there's a way, there's hope.
- I've seen it.

I...

You can get rid of it by talking.

Sally, get yourself to a priest.
To a church.

- The blue's healing super nicely.

Better rest up for tomorrow, beauty.
You wondering why the fuck you decided to do this yet?
No.
I'm wondering why I picked something that takes so many fucking visits.
You said you wanted it finished by your birthday.
And so it shall be.
Thirty fucking five.
Oof.
Ah!
What are you doing up?
Oh...
I can't sleep.

Didn't Dr. Fred give you something for the pain?
Yeah, I didn't fill it.
I think I have some Vicodin.
I don't think I should take it, Belle.

Come on, Kev.
You're an alcoholic, you're not a Vicodin addict.
You can't go in there tomorrow on no sleep.
Well...
It's gonna be fine.
You keep them just in case.
I'm not talking about the painkillers, I'm talking about court.
You're gonna be great.
You're gonna be there, right?
Of course.
We're all gonna be there.
No matter what happens, we're gonna be okay, aren't we?
- Me and you?

'Cause that's the only thing I care about.

Okay.
Let's get some sleep, okay?
Come on.

Let's get some sleep.
We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service.
If you feel you have reached this recording in error, please check...
- John?

- It's late.

I was wondering if I could stay a couple nights.
Well, sure, honey.

- That's fine.

Oh, yeah, no, it's fine.

In the building.

It's just a matter of time.
- Just want you to know I'm grateful.

I feel good.

Maybe.

Fucking Kevin's a piece of shit.
And now we're gonna destroy him.
- Yeah?

Of course.
You got everything you need?
Yeah.
I'm having trouble sleeping.
Oh, I keep having these dreams.
I dreamed I was at a funeral in the middle of a river, and... people all brought the same flowers.
Tiger lilies.

I wanna ask you something.
Okay.
It's about Meg.
- What about her?

Have you had any contact with her?
How many times are you...?
I'm gonna keep asking you about it, because if she doesn't come back here, they're gonna make her a suspect.
And the fact that nobody in this family has heard from her makes her look very guilty.
I don't know where she is, John.
Her car is still in the parking lot.
Weren't you supposed to sell her car?
I know.

Is that because you think she's gonna need it when she comes back after the trial, or is that something she told you?
- John...

You've gotta understand.
You have no goddamn idea how easily this whole thing could go sideways.
You have no idea.
I need to talk to her.
Please, tell me where she is.
Sorry I missed your call.
Please leave me a message.
I shouldn't even have called you.

Okay?

There's a reason your dad didn't want you to come down to the Keys.
He didn't bring you down here, he didn't want you to meet that fucking family, and that money...
It's your ticket out.
I'll do it.
I'll cover any other legal fees.
Any cost to further discovery, I'll do my best to limit.
And I can still follow up with Chelsea's deposition, and I can fact-check within our budget.
What do you mean, "follow up"?
Well, right now it's her word against Kevin Rayburn's.
And it would be better if we had corroborating evidence that proved that she actually drove Meg Rayburn to Marco's house.
- Do we have time to try and find that?

Which means I'm gonna have to ask the judge for a stay.
What the fuck is a stay?
Basically, I would petition the judge to postpone the trial, and it's highly unlikely that she'll grant it.
- But it's possible?

I'll try.
But don't hold your breath.
- Jesus.

I didn't think there'd be so many people.
It's all gonna be okay.
They're all rooting for you.
- Kevin, can we get a word?

- What are you gonna say?

- Do you hate Eric?

What a circus.
Crazy.
But he's gonna do terrific.
- Of course he is.

- Hey.

- You ready?

- Easy-breezy.

Well, let's go.

Remember, you need a break, you let us know.
You need a question repeated, let us know.
You need anything, just let us know.
After you received the call from Marco Diaz, what happened?
I walked over to his house.
You walked?
Uh, yes, sir.

- Why is that?

I got into a car accident and I got a DUI.
Were you sober when you walked to see Marco?
Yes, sir.
How long had you been sober prior to that night?
Uh...

I went into AA the day after the accident, so...
I just got my six-month chip.
Well, congratulations.
What did you see...

Well, first I heard arguing as I approached the door.
- And then?

I saw Marco get hit in the head.
And then what happened?
I tried to stop it, but I got there too late.
Marco was already getting hit over and over again.
I didn't know what to do.
So, um...

Yeah, I tried to stop it, but it...

That's when I got shot.
Is the person that shot you in this courtroom today?
Kevin?
Can you identify the person that you saw kill Marco Diaz?
- Yes, sir.

He's sitting right there.
Eric O'Bannon.
He killed Marco, and then he shot me.
Mr. Rayburn, I'd like to ask you one further question.
When you were at Marco Diaz's house, did you see anyone else other than the defendant and Marco?
No, sir.
You didn't see your wife?
- No.

No.
- Your brother?

Any other relatives, family members?
Aunts, uncles, cousins?
No.
No.
Nothing further, Your Honor.
Miss Santos, cross?
Where's John?
I don't know.
Let's go back to the night of the murder.
I'm a little confused.

- I'll try.

I have your cell phone records in front of me.
On the night of the murder, your sister, Meg, called you several times.
Why was she trying so desperately to get in touch with you?
I don't know.

You'd have to ask her.
Unfortunately, since she's disappeared, we can't.
Objection, Your Honor.

Sustained.

Yes, Your Honor.
Did your sister leave you any voicemails?
Yes.

And why didn't you do that?
Why didn't you take her calls?
Do you have any siblings?
Sometimes you don't wanna deal with family stuff, you know?
I just wasn't in the mood.
I see.
And these records also show that you called your brother, John, seven times that night.
That seems unusual.

Um...
Mr. Rayburn, I asked you a question.
Why were you trying so desperately to get in touch with John?
- Objection, Your Honor.

Rephrase it, counselor.
Why did you call your brother, John, seven times?
- I had to talk to him.

What was that about?

My wife was pregnant at the time.
And, uh... she was having some abdominal pains.
And so I called John to see if he thought we should go to the hospital, because he has kids.

Why didn't you mention that when we spoke about Meg's calls?
Forgot.
Really?
Because you remember everything perfectly in the hours that followed.
But you forgot that your wife's pregnancy was in danger?
I was shot twice that night.

Let's talk about your family.
You seem incredibly close-knit.
- Sorry, was that a question?

- I guess.

Objection, Your Honor.

It goes to credibility.
There's only one eyewitness to this crime, so we could use some leeway here.
I'll allow it.

Thank you.
So, this tragedy, what happened?
My sister died.
Now, this is your older sister, Sarah, correct?
- Yes.

She drowned.

I'm sorry.
And that same day, your brother, Danny, ended up in the hospital.
How did that happen?
Um, I...

You don't know?
I was a little kid.

And your family didn't talk about it?
It was painful for us.
It still is.
I'm sure.
Your father blamed Danny for your sister's death, didn't he?
And isn't it true that your brother, Danny, wasn't hit by a truck?
Your Honor, please.
That your father beat him up so badly that he ended up in the hospital?
Isn't that what really happened?
- I don't remember.

- I'm getting there.

And that your family covered for your father.
Isn't it true that your family lied to the police to protect him?
I don't know.
Doesn't your family have a history of covering for each other?
- Objection.

When you were arrested for drug possession, didn't your sister, Meg, represent you?
Yes.
And she got you a plea?

- Yes.

You must have been grateful to her.

- Objection.

Let's go back to the phone calls from Meg.
If Meg was in trouble, wouldn't you be the first phone call
- that she would make?

Sustained.
Isn't it true that it wasn't Marco who called you to come to the house that night?
- It was your sister, Meg.

Meg called you, the one person that owed her and that loved her enough to take a bullet for her.
That is not true.
And that you called John Rayburn, your brother, seven times,
- to frame Eric O'Bannon for the murder...

- That your sister, Meg, committed.

Your Honor, the Rayburn family is not on trial here.
My objection still stands.
Sustained.

I apologize, Your Honor.

I withdraw the question.

Thank you, Mr. Rayburn.

Actually, maybe this is the right house.
Amy!
♪ Lose your blues, everybody cut ♪
Oh, my God.
You made it?
Wow.
This is John, everybody.

We grew up together.
- Hey, John.

- What's up, man?

Why did you do it, Kev?
Why did you lie?
I was fine that night.
I didn't have any problems with the baby.
You weren't even home.
You left earlier with Meg.
They were gunning for her.

- What if they call me?

- Am I supposed to lie on the stand?

I could go to jail.
- They're not gonna call you.

- They won't.

I don't know!
Fuck!

I've been answering fucking questions all day!

So, you and Amy grew up together.
Yeah.
She said your parents were friends.

- Yeah.

Same base, even.
How long is it that...

Oh, uh...

Ever since she gave me free drinks at the bar the night my dad died.

What a horrible accident.
Hmm.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
No, no, I mean, how her folks passed.
Yeah.
Amy and I have, um...
You know, we've really bonded over being parentless.
Yeah, I'm sure you have.
Anyway... just really nice to meet you, John.
You, too.
- That went a lot better than I expected.

You've got them scared.
I've never seen Sally so unhinged as when she walked out of that courtroom.
You must have impressed Judge Reens, too, because she's considering our motion for a stay.
Yeah?

Well, she didn't say, "Fuck you," but it's still a long shot, so you need to be ready to testify.
I am.
You'll be up first, and we'll swing big from the start.
Day after tomorrow, if the Honorable Judge Reens denies us.
Sure, okay.
Do you think it would help if I testify?
In relation to what?
We don't want you getting mixed up in this.
I'm a Rayburn.
I'm already mixed up in it.
Would've broken your daddy's heart to see you leave the way you did.
You didn't even press your dress.
I was in a hurry to get away.
Leaving us for a man who didn't even give you a ring.
Now your Meg is giving you a taste of your own medicine.
Don't talk about her like you know her.
She'd never do that to me.
Then why are you sitting out here worrying about her?
You wouldn't understand.
No?
Night like this... takes me back.
You remember?
You make sure the boy's car had seat belts?
She's not with a boy, Mama.

Before you were out of your training bras, I started making them come inside first.
You put the fear of God in them.
She'll come back.
I wouldn't be so sure.
I don't have to listen to this.
Hello?
Yes, this is Sally Rayburn.
Oh, yes, of course I remember, Mr. Marx.
Is something wrong?
You know it's that time, birthday girl.
- What?

- See what?

You know.

You mean, a little of this?
- Yeah!

- That's fantastic.

- you grew up with anymore, huh?

Thanks to LC.
My shop is just four blocks down, past those red lights.
On the left.
Huh.
Do you have a tattoo?
No, I don't.

His mother would kill him.
She would.
I love it here.
You can see the ocean on a clear day.
I like that you can see over people's heads.
Do you ever get that feeling when you're somewhere high, like you wanna jump?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

How about that feeling when you wanna...
When you wanna push someone?
There's a name for it.
There's a name for it.
Oh, no, here she goes again, knowing shit.
The call of...

Tenth grade French failing me.
- "The call of the void."

Surprises all around.
She knows French.
And she got cute friends.
What else are you hiding up that soon-to-be tatted sleeve?
That's it for me.
Give us some dirt on the birthday girl.
No, my lips are sealed.
I will drink to that.
Happy birthday, Ames!
Thank you.
I...

Your family was slandered today, Ms. Rayburn.
You mean, all that nonsense with Meg?
No, I'm talking about the past, what happened with your husband and your son.
We think you'd be the best person to refute that.
You want me to testify?
Mrs. Rayburn, you have a great standing in this community.
Your family name means something.
A pier's dedicated to you, charitable contributions...
Almost 50 years of business at your inn.
Do you really want these insinuations to go unanswered?
You could dispel them.
Well, what if Meg came back?
Do you have information about where she is?
No, I just...
I just thought it might help.
Of course it would.
Right now she's a phantom.
The defense can paint any picture of her they want to.
But you could rebut that.
You could give Meg a human face.
I'll get back to you, Mr. Marx.
How does it feel to be 35 again?
It's a great excuse to have a party.
And since when do you like parties?
Since my family is not at them.
I got your message.
I'm not coming home.
You realize that Eric's defense is attempting to make you a suspect?
I said, I got the message.
I mean, I thought at least once you heard that you could at least... give me a fucking call or something.
Why?

You don't care what people are saying?
I don't want any part of it.
If they can't find me, they cannot force me to testify.
What about Mom?
What about Mom?
Don't you think that Mom needs you?
I think you need me.
I think you and Kevin need me.
And I would rather stay and hide forever... than go back and lie in court.
How long you staying?
- When we used to play hide-and-seek...

It was just a game.
To you.
Oh, my God.

I was never good enough.
You wouldn't let me win even once.
And what did you guys used to say to me?
"Hide better."
I finally feel like me, John.
Hmm.
I'm not going back home to feel like that kid again and hate myself.
I'm not going.
Okay.
Sorry.
Ma!
Hi.

Abbington's out, so we're short in Radiology.
Why don't you have a seat?
They're already riding my ass.

Sit.

I mean, can't we just talk about this later?
There is no later.
We're letting you go.
For what?
'Cause I didn't take those sick days?
- It has nothing to do with that.

- No, it does not.

Percocet was found missing from inventory.
When security reviewed the video, they saw that you stole them.
It was only once, I swear.
It was just one time.
- Isn't there anything you can do?

I did speak for you.

Yeah, they fucking know that.
Jackson Memorial's gonna call for a reference.

I had no choice.
Fuck me.
Meg?
Meggie?
Is that you, honey?
- Is that you?

This is Meg's house.
She only drinks tequila.
She doesn't have room for more than one bottle in this place?
Oh, you look so tired, Mama.
Come on.
I raised you better than to say that to a woman over the age of 20.
The day your daddy went away, do you remember?
- You...

You were shaking.
Yeah.

Such a disgrace.
I felt... the wolves were coming again.
They were hiding behind the bushes.

Shh.

I could smell them.
That wet fur.

I'm sorry.
I couldn't stay, Mama.
I had to be with Robert.
They want me to testify.
I know.
What do I do?
You got your own children to look out for.
John?
- Hey.

Uh...

I was hiking up the hill.

I think he might have been crying.
- When was that?

On the way down, he was still there.
I left my phone in the car, so I couldn't call sooner.
Where?
Hey.

LC said she saw you.
You okay?
I was on my way to the airport.
You were gonna leave without saying goodbye?
I thought it'd be easier.
Jesus Christ, you really get up this early every morning?
Yeah.

I have nightmares.
Well, one nightmare.

There's someone that's coming down the driveway at the inn.
And they're trying to break into the house, and I can't lock the doors.
They won't lock.

They won't work.
And then I wake up right before I see who the person is.
I don't know.

I don't think you're crazy.
Kevin...
Kevin's told me he's had a dream very similar to that.
Heh.
What about you?
- What about me?

What are you gonna do?
Would it really help if I came home?
It probably would.
What do you want me to do?
Have you ever felt like you knew something... deep down inside... but if you actually said it out loud, people would think you were crazy?
Where was John the night Marco was killed?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
We'd, um...
We'd had a bad fight, and he'd gone to stay somewhere else.
- Did you try to call him?

I called, and he didn't pick up.
I know that he went for a drive because his truck broke down somewhere north.
Did he return your calls?
No.
We were in a...
We were having serious problems.
Something's wrong with all of this.
I think... they're all lying, Diana.
Kevin.
John, even Sally.
All of them.
- Here you are.

Will you stop?

There are no wolves here.
It's nothing.

There's a wasp nest under the porch.
Where is she?
Did you find Meg?
Don't lie to me, John.
'Cause I can see it in your face.
Did you tell her what's going on here?
She asked me what I wanted her to do, and I told her.
And she was supposed to meet me at the airport, and she didn't show up.
Well, I want to talk to her.
She's disconnected her phone.

She's not coming home.
That lawyer, she said some terrible things about us when Kevin was on the stand.
I'm so sorry.
They want me to testify.
- No.

I have to talk to Marx.

No.
It's time.
It's time to clear the air.
Clear the...?
What does that mean?
It's time.
We really appreciate you coming in, Mrs. Rayburn.
Sally.

Sally.

It must have been painful for you to hear these charges against your family.
Yes.

But I gather there's a few things you'd like to clear up for us.
Yes.
The defense counsel made reference to a day that happened some 30 years ago.
- Do you remember that day?

Can you please tell us what happened that day?
My daughter, Sarah, drowned.
I'm sorry.

Is there something else you'd like to share?
I had decided... to leave my husband.
We had a terrible fight.
Danny took Sarah out on the boat just to... get her away from all the yelling.
I was gonna go to my mother's, then, uh...
Then send for the kids.
- But you never got there, did you?

They stopped the bus and told me about my daughter.
And by the time I got back home, Danny was in the hospital.
And Danny is your son.
He was my son.
And he was in a car accident, wasn't he?
And he was badly injured.
No.
He was beaten by my husband.
Ms. Rayburn, are you sure?
Because we heard testimony earlier.
I'm sure.
- Your Honor, I'd like a recess.

She's your witness, counselor.
Please continue, Mrs. Rayburn.
His, uh...
Danny's shoulder clicked... whenever he moved it after...
After that.
And I'd hear the click and I'd think:
"Well, that didn't heal right."
Well, the police report we have indicates otherwise.
I know it does.
I also know... what it was like to have a father go to jail.
The shame of it, and I...
I just thought about the night the police came... for my father.
The whole town was on the street watching my mother cry.
Never thought she'd stop crying.
I didn't want my children to have to live through that.
So, I told them to lie.
And they did.
Your Honor, please, a recess.
The day...
Sarah died...
I chose my husband over my son.
It crushed Danny.
He was never the same after that.
It was like...

Abraham and Isaac.
But God sent an angel to save Isaac.
Danny wasn't so lucky.
No angels for him.
I hope you never... have to ever make a choice like that.
On the same day,
I lost my daughter and I also lost my son.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Mrs. Rayburn, would you like to take a break?
I'd like to continue.
Your witness, counsel.
Thank you for your candor, Mrs. Rayburn.
Hard truths are painful.

No.
I'd like to direct your attention towards your daughter, Meg.
Do you know where she is currently?
No.
Do you think it strange that she left so soon after Marco Diaz was murdered?
And she hasn't e-mailed you or called you?
I didn't say she never called me.
You've heard from her?
Yes.
I thought you said you didn't know where she was.
I don't.
You admitted that you told your children to lie.
Just that one time.
Does that include John?
- Yes.

Yes.
So, given this history of lying, do you think it's possible that Kevin is lying now when he says he saw my client murder Marco Diaz?
- I don't know.

I don't know.
Do you think it's possible that your daughter, Meg, murdered Marco Diaz in a jealous fit?
And then called Kevin to help her?
And then shot Kevin to frame an innocent man?
And then they had John cover it all up.
Is that possible?
Is that possible, based on your family's history of lying to protect the family?
Do you think that all three of them are lying now?

No.
No?

No.
It's not possible.
Meg could not have killed Marco Diaz.
Not unless she was able to be in two places at the same time.
What does that mean?
Meg was with me.
Meg was with you on the night that Marco Diaz was murdered?
- Yes.

From 11 on.
She was asleep by midnight.
- Why didn't you mention this to anybody?

Mrs. Rayburn, I'm sorry.
Please help me to understand.
You had this information and you never came forward?
My daughter... is not on trial for murdering Marco Diaz, Ms. Santos.
Your client is.
Fuck you.
Fuck you all.
Mom.
Hmm?
I know what you've done for all of us.
Thank you.
You can't do this.

You should have seen how they fucking looked at her.
It's like she was the Virgin fucking Mary up there weeping.
It doesn't mean anything.

They're gonna feel bad for a minute and...
Doesn't mean they're gonna find you guilty.
It's not just a mom, it's Sally Fucking Rayburn.

Fuck.

Thirty fucking years.
- It's that or the death penalty.

You haven't even put up his case.

I can't call you as a witness anymore, Chelsea.
I don't want you to fucking call her as a witness.
Marx will just chew you alive.
The circumstances of your firing completely discredit your testimony.
- What?

I didn't steal anything.

- They have you on camera.

Doesn't matter, Chelsea.
So, that's it?

It's not really my decision.
And even if we plead guilty, they may not accept it.
You told me you believed in him.
I do.
But what happened today, Sally Rayburn hurt us.
I'm done.
I don't wanna die.
So, you'll talk to them?
Diana told me the story that you told about your father and...
Jesus, I...
I can't imagine what...
What you went through.

I just... thought maybe it'd help.
It wasn't true.
Of course not.
Don't you think I would've told you that by now?
And just so we're clear,
I didn't do it for you or for Kevin.
I did it for Meg.
Well, like I said, I'm sorry y'all had to go through this.
I wish your family the best.
Move on with your lives, put this shit in your rear-view mirror.
Listen, um, I wanna say... thank you for everything you've done.
A new day begins, right, Kevin?
Good night, man.
Well, that was quite a performance.
The jury wept.
- I almost shed a tear myself.

Mm.
You always do, Sally.
That's what I admire about you.
For all that sweetness, you're about as cold-blooded as they come.
Is that your idea of a compliment?
- Your kids know you're here?

- I don't want them involved.

I'll tell them when it's appropriate.
I think you might regret it, Sally.
This is not something you can take back once it's done.
It's time.
I thought you might know someone.
I might.
