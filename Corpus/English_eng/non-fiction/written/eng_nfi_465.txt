Previously on no tomorrow...

I don't know.

You need to decide what's.
More important to you,
Obsessing over this theory...
Or us.
I'm going to the airport,
And I hope you meet me there.
I'm wrong.
I'm wrong!
I can spend a lifetime with evie!
My god, we've got to get to the airport.
Jesse, man,
You just missed the exit.
We're not turning around, cuz.
Did you drug me?
Hello, mr.

The asteroid...

It's a credible threat.
So, mr.

Where exactly did this asteroid theory come from?
His name is hamish stegner, jr.
But he also goes by the name xavier holliday.
Xavier holliday?
Beard?

I will be damned.
He has been chasing me down for months.
Has he shown this theory to anyone else?
He talks about it all the time,
But people don't really take him seriously.
Okay, great...

Can know about the reality of this threat until we have.
A plan in place to deal with the public's expected response.
Mass panic and chaos?
Exactly.
You share this information with anybody,
And you will spend the last few months.
Of your life in a prison.
For treason... you hear me?
All right,
Do you have any idea where xavier holliday is right now?
It's kind of a soft x
What d...?

Z...

Where xavier holliday is right now?

Jesse!
Jesse!
Jesse!
Jesse!
Jesse!
Jesse, you turn around!
We're supposed to be halfway off to...
Skaftafell.
Wow, that looks incredible.
I hear the waterfall there will take your breath away..
Wow.

This guidebook is pretty under the radar.
Yeah.

Trying to find the best one.
It was either this or...
Beyond reykjavik?
That's the one!

Um...
So, my seatmate is...
Snoring, which is totally fine,
I can live with that, you know?
Except he's also drooling on me.
You see that?
Wow.
That is substantial.
It's so wet.
Would you mind...
If i...
Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.
Thank you.

I'm sorry.

Evie.

Nice to meet you, too.
Are you out of your mind?

I've been screaming through this window for hours!
What the hell is going on?
Where the hell are we?
Majestic eastern oregon, cuz.
Should be rolling into houston.
In 26 hours, depending on bathroom breaks.
Luckily, I have a huge gallbladder.
Your gallbladder has nothing to do...
Wait.

Nonstop about this looming asteroid strike for years.
Now you have a chance to sit down with mr.

The head of space!
You have to go...
I...

I saw the simulation...

I don't care what tina danza fate says.
Tyra deneil fields is the most credible.
Astrophysicist on the planet.
We're not going to houston;

She thinks I blew her off.

And where are my pants?
Yeah, the tranqs.
That I gave you relax.
All the muscle groups,
Including the gallbladder ones, so...
You pee-pee'd, but I hung them out of the window to air-dry.
Wha...?

That's where I taped 'em.

My phone and my passport were in the pockets.
We'll find them.
We'll just retrace our steps.

We've only gone, like, 500 miles or so.
This is a nightmare.
No.

I'm-i'm so sorry.
No, no, no.

Don't worry about it.
Hey, I guess it's symmetrical now, right?
It's like earrings...
One's weird, two is cool.
Symmetry.
All right, well, now you're awake,
Um, I'm gonna stretch a bit.
You were waiting to stretch.
I'm the worst.

How long was I out?

With a blood clot because of me?
Well, the chance.
Of deep vein thrombosis is actually very small.
Without associative risk factors, so I should be fine.
You sound like a doctor.
I hope so.
I am a doctor.
What kind of medicine?

Have you heard of doctors without borders?
Yeah.

No, no, no.
Their health care system is stellar.
Um, I got a bit of time off.
Before my next assignment, so
I'm gonna go see the northern lights.
Same here.
Really?

I'm not a selfless doctor, but seeing the northern lights.
Has always been on my list...

Although I blasted out my rsum just before I boarded.
On one of those national employment web sites.
To keep things moving while I'm away,
But in the meantime, I'm really happy.
To be unplugging and enjoying some me time.
While also getting a chance to see some solar particles.
Light up in a spectacular way.
That was one sentence.
Yeah, my lungs started to burn at the end.
I have a weird feeling about this.
Deirdre's been acting strange since we started here.
Well, that's a whole new group of people.
She has to coldly assert her will over.
Must be stressful.

She needs a little sweet treat pick-me-up.
I'm gonna grab her some dr.

Okay...
No!

You may be wondering.
Where the soda is.
It's related.
To my first official act as the new branch manager.
For cybermart tacoma.
Hi.
Um...

No.
H-period-i-period.
For healthy initiatives.
New programs and policies promoting.
Healthy bodies and a healthy planet,
Which includes.
A complete and immediate ban.
Of all soda and confections.
What?
I thought I left ussr.
I thought I left fresno!
I detect your resistance,
But you will heed my decree.
My goal is to ensure.
A safe and healthy future for the world.
For cybermart and all of its workers.
That is all.
She...
She can't...

Okay, this, this is a...
A what, hank?
Deirdre, you know how I feel about cream soda.
And you know how I feel.
When you don't support my work initiatives.
You are no longer my boyfriend.
That's right, and that is why.
We are all gonna embrace this new plan!
Right?
They're all gone,
But they're all embracing it.
Boo!

Hey, remember my advice.
Yes.

And stay off webmd.
Yeah.

Since we're both solo travelers,
Maybe we could...

Or see some sights together.
You know, it wouldn't hurt to have some company.
Actually, it would.
See, I was,
Um, originally going on this trip with a guy,
But when he bailed,
I realized it was time.
For me to strike out on my own,
So I'm making this a solo journey.
It's just, you know,
What I need right now.

I think I see what's going on here.
You feel like we slept together too soon.
The thing is
I was awake the whole time just...
Feeling your saliva slowly soaking.
Through my shirt.

No, I get it, I get it.
A solo journey.

Well, I hope it's a wonderful one.
You, too.
Tell you what, that find my phone app's a godsend.
Yep.
Now all we have to do is find a way up there.
Going up?

Yay.
Ooh.
Should I run?
Please don't.
I really want to run.
First, you pulled over.
Without putting on your hazards.

Running your plates pulled up a bench warrant for your arrest.
What?

That's accurate.

Are in possession of unprescribed.
Equine tranquilizers.
No, sir, those are prescribed.
The equine's just not here today.
I'm taking you both in.
Man!
He didn't even call.
What?

international component,
Charity arm... .
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Hey, this is evie.

After the beep, do your thang.
Hey, hey, hey, it's me.
Listen, I was on the way to the airport,
All right, but I just got waylaid.
Um, I'm now in a..

In, yakima, actually.
Jesse's here.
Hey, evie!
That was jesse.
Listen, I'm gonna find a way out of this mess,
And I'm gonna come meet you, all right, I prom...
Time's up.
You know, that was very rude.
I hope that was worth your one call.
Yeah, well, I'm sure my cousin made a call.
And bailed both of us out, so...
I did...
Not think of that.
I called amber and got pretty sidetracked.
That's...
That's fantastic.
Well done.

Well done.
Now we have no money and no prospect of making bail.
On the bright side,
I found this harmonica under the mattress.
How do we sort this out?
So I'll just bring it down to the concierge,
And you'll call the airline?
Thank you.
Okay.
Hey!

Um, you...
This is kind of weird?
Yeah, we have the, we have the same suitcase,
And you're staying in the room across the hall from mine?
Coincidences on coincidences.
I was gonna take this down to the concierge.
So they could call the airline, but no need, I guess.
No.

Perfect.

And stellar organizational skills, by he way.
Yeah, right back at you, dr.

Well, anyone who doesn't roll is...
Crazy.

Do you pack your socks...?

Of course you do, yes!
Okay, cool.

Take care.
Solo journey.
Hey.
Where were you?
I waited at the bar for three hours.
You haven't been returning my texts.
I'm sorry.

I got caught up in a...

And I lost track of time.
Okay, look.
I understand getting caught up in a story,
But are you sure you don't want to tell me about it?
As a journalist, what do you do.
If you have very sensitive information,
But you've been sworn to secrecy,
But the-the weight of it all just,
Just weighs you down.
Because it's so...

You are much too burdened by this.
You need to free your mind.
You got to go on a trip.
Yeah?
Where... aruba?
Jamaica?
Different kind of trip.
Scratchers?
Honeymoons don't pay for themselves.
Well, where you gonna go?
Key largo?

Hedonism resort in jamaica.
It's expensive, th, gh,
Even splitting the suite six ways.
six ways¬ù?

Don't think about it too hard.
Have you noticed that nobody's doing any work?
All right, come on, guys.
Hey, you don't need sugar to have a good,
Productive work day.
We cannot just quit cool turkey.
The deirdre is worst.
Look, she's not gonna mind if we sneak one little.
Soda in every now and again.
Hands up!
That came with the socks.
This is a dry warehouse!
Pardon me?
Would you mind sharing your table with another diner?
It's the only open seating we have.
Of course.
I'm happy to share.
Thank you.
Right this way, sir.
Thank you.
Hi.
I didn't realize it was your table she was talking about.
I'm sorry.

No, no, no, no, no.
You're on a solo journey, and I respect that.
I'll just, I'll get room service, I guess.
I love room service.

I mean, the tiny ketchup, eating with no pants on.
Come on, it's the best.
Right?
All right.
Take care.
Here.
Let me get this for you.
You're welcome.
I still won.
You left the middle wide open, silly dumb-dumb.
Xavier holliday.
Some lady has bailed you out.
Do you think evie got my message and came back from iceland?
Dr. Fields.
All charges have been dropped.
What?
I need you to come with me immediately.
Your theory.
It's been confirmed.
What?

They're waiting for you.
What?

How's it going?
It's an honor, mr.

We'd love for you to walk us through.
Your theory in as much detail as possible.
My the...?
You guys want to see my slideshow?

My goodness.
So excited.
Let's get started.
Wait a second.
We've got a straggler.
Come on over, sir.
No way.
Excuse me.
Let's get going.
The northern lights await!
What's with, all the precautions?
Ayahuasca isn't some party drug.
That dulls your senses and makes you crave cheese-puffs.
How much of this are we supposed to smoke?
You don't smoke ayahuasca.
You drink it.

You know I'm not really a tea guy.
It's a very spiritual experience.
Yeah, not really a spiritual guy, either.
I promise, this will be a very transcendent experience for you.
All negative energy will be purged from your soul.
Once the literal purging is finished.
Wait, what?
Yeah, before the enlightenment portion,
There's a projectile vomiting and hallucination portion.
I don't think mine's working.
Have another sip.
Nope.

Maybe I'm just.
Already evolved.
Good blord.
Kareema.
Your coffee make sound of fizzy bubble soda pop.
I know.

You also suffer no signs of withdrawal.
Please, hey, be pal.
One sip.
I give you 20 dollar.
20 bucks for a sip?
Da.
Deal.
Sweet, fizzy, fizzy soda.
Spasibo.
Just do me a favor.
You tell your comrades to come see me.
I have what they need.
Da.
Hello, honeymoon.
Has anyone got any questions?
Yes.
Why can we neglect the seasonal yarkovsky effect.
In calculating the probability of impact?
Because the heliocentric radius.
Is large compared to the geocentric radius,
So, as we get closer to the planet...
It has less influence,
So what was a close encounter.
At the same position is now a direct hit.
Precisely.
So how do we stop it?
I have got a few thoughts on the subject,
But we might want to order dinner first.
Who wants thai?
So, are we getting close?
Yeah.

Okay.
Sugar butter!
What?
Sugar butter.
Like, everyone should try peanut butter,
And-and-and apple butter and almond butter,
And-and butter butter,
But never sugar butter.
It's just like butter butter, but with sugar.
It's a better butter.
There-there's so many things that people haven't tried.
But-but there-there is also things that people have tried,
But I haven't tried them.
I want to try them.
Isn't life just beautiful?
It's just like one long line.
Of infinite possibilities.
And th-there's so much that I-i want to do.
Starting with you.
Over here, sexy.
Talia.
All we have is right now.
And right now is happening all the time,
So we, we need.
To make the most of all the time right now.
Yes.
Evie?
Graham.
Of course you're here.
The perils of the same guide book.
So, did you see the lights?
Yeah.

It was stunning.
Magical.
It's pretty crazy?
I mean, we just,
Keep running into each other.
Yeah.
Wait.
Okay.
Sorry.
Kind of thought we were having a moment.
We were, and we almost had several more.
Look.
Um, I'm not trying to push anything.
I'm, really, I'm not.
Doesn't it seem like the universe.
Is trying to tell us something?
You know, I don't really believe in that.
Fate.

It just takes away all agency.
Every decision I've ever made has led me to this place.
At this moment, not fate.
Okay.

To extend your trip?
And then we could decide.
To see how this goes.
Yeah.

Then I'd be following your lead,
And this trip is about forging my own path.
Right.
So I'm gonna go.
I have an early flight tomorrow, so...
What if you're wrong?
What if you're wrong?
What if this is fated?
Well, then we'll cross paths again, won't we?
Let's not discouraged, all right?
What if we revisit launching the ion beam shepherds?
It's not possible.
We're years away from having a shuttle capable of that.
What if we use solar sails?
We ran the simulations.
Didn't work.
I need more caffeine...

Please.
Follow me, big boy.
It's a speakeasy.
You are hero.
All right.

Spend lots of money.
Do you have any, pretzels?
No.
Holy chilly cherry cola.
Hey, hank...

In a delicious homemade soda?
Kareema, you have to shut this place down now.
For me, please.
I promised deirdre I'd support her.
You know, from where I'm standing, it looks like.
You could use a little support.
First one's on the house.
I can't.

You're such a good boyfriend.
You deserve a treat.
She never has to know.
No, no, no, no, no.
Okay, please, hit me again.
Hank.
Tsetse fly.
How you been?

Is that vomit on your shirt?

Yeah.

Are you on something?

No.

No.

To start a band together?
You do the music, I do the noises.
Yes, yes, yes.
What are we waiting for?
Let's, let's, let's do it today.
Yes!

I will literally say yes to anything.
I feel so good.

We need a band name.

We need merch.

We need fans.

I think you're a super fit for big boxtown,
Given your cybermart experience.
Thank you.

Was that the ad mentioned an international component.
I just got back from a life-changing trip to iceland.
And it really clarified for me.
That I want to see more of the world.
N-no.

I meant that the qc manager here would liaise with qc managers.
In other branches in other countries.
You know, like, by phone and e-mail.
Okay.
Well, I'm also excited about the charity arm.
That the ad mentioned.
So are we.
Although, the launch is still a good 18 to 24 months away.
This feels hopeless.
We can't expect to solve a crisis.
Like this in a couple days, right?
There's an elite asteroid defense team.
From silicon valley...
Have you met with them?

But I wrote to them, more than I write to you,
But they never responded.
Well, they are gathering together in d.C.
To work with us on this.
And I want you to come with me.
You have been thinking about this longer than anybody.
And we need you.
I need something different.
Something that combines everything I'm passionate about.
Organization, logistics, philanthropy, world travel,
And I don't know if that job exists,
But I am gonna keep looking for it.
Thank you for your time.
Hold on.
I think my sister.
Might have something ideal for you.
Why don't you give her a call?
It would mean completely upending your life.
But it sounds like you're ready for that.
I know it's a lot to ask.
It means totally upending your life.
And for the time being, you couldn't tell anybody why.
Look at it this way,
I'm asking you to help save humankind.
Yep.
Yep, yep.

Okay.

But then pop two this time.

Yeah.

You know?

I think we got it.

Everything is music.
Everything is noises.
Jesse, have you been using my toothbrush to clean the sink?
Hey.
Hi.
Hi.

How was iceland?

It was transformative.
I'm so sorry I didn't go.
Things...

No.

You know, better, actually.
You know, it turns out going alone was exactly what I needed.
So I just went with it.
Brilliant.
Well, in the spirit of spontaneity,
Um, what would you say if...
If I asked you to move to d.C. With me?
Wh-what?

No.

What is in d.C.?
A job with the government.
Sort of a dream job, actually.
I can't really say much more than that.
This is about the asteroid?
I thought your research was wrong.
Well, there's always the slightest possibility that...
It isn't.
Wow.
Look.

I wouldn't want to know at this point.
I'm in the best place of my life.
I got my own dream job.
I went after exactly what I wanted,
And I got it.
Wow.

It is.
It's in the philippines.
In-in the philippines.
Well...
It's-it's a ways from d.C., then.
If I followed you to d.C., I'd regret losing this opportunity.
Just like you would if you followed me,
So let's agree not to regret anything.
Because...
I don't regret a thing so far.
I'm flying!
Hey, what do you say...
We do one more?
You go high, I go low.

My god, it's so much better.

Hi, hank.
Tom.

Timothy.

Tom's fine.

Why do I smell high fructose corn syrup?
I don't know.
What's this on your shirt?
Nothing.
Soda...
Pop.
Fine.
We've been drinking.

No.
Where.
Did you.
Get it?
It's the fuzz!
Where's the fizz?
You have risked the health and well-being.
Of everyone in this warehouse,
And you will be held to account.
I was just trying.
To make enough money to pay for my honeymoon.
Go into debt like everyone else!
That's enough!
You can't treat people like this.
This prohibition isn't just about the fizzy pop.
What's really going on with you?
I have obsessed.
About health...
Specifically yours and mine...
For an urgent and unexpected reason.
I am currently with child.
What?
And I apologize.
For going overboard with the health measures,
But I am a woman of advanced age, and...
You and I need to be around for a very long time.
For this child.

You're saying I'm gonna be a papa bear?
I am indeed.
My god...
Aw...

Man, that was fun.
That was one of our best.
You know, I'm gonna miss this.
You know...

Doesn't mean you have to stop going on adventures.
I fully intend to keep adventuring,
But what I'm gonna miss is you.
Evie... because of you...
I reconciled with my dad...
I fell in love...
And I had 133 of the best days of my entire life.
So thank you.
Well, because of you, I took risks
I never would've taken,
I quit my job, and I learned to carpe the fig out of my diem, so...
Thank you.
Hold on to this.
And if everything goes as I hope...
I'll be back for it in four months.
It feels so weird to say good-bye.
Well...
Then...
Let's just say, until we meet again.
Yeah, until we meet again.
It's really nice of you to record this.
Yeah, I figure I can sell the footage.
If they get famous, and take a second honeymoon.
So you've raised enough money for jamaica?
Turns out recycling is a great thing to do.
For money.
When your speakeasy gets shut down,
But you still need cash for a sex resort.
The finger!

Yes!

Rock on!
Let's-let's-let's do something crazy.
Let's-let's go freebasing off a cliff.
I think you mean base jumping.
I did.
But let's not rule anything out.
Okay!
Hank, I do hope hank jr.

As you are.

We don't know.

See, that's cool.

Hank.
It's a baby hazmat suit for the baby.
To protect our offspring against airborne pathogens.
That's right, baby doll.
That's actually extremely touching.
Wait, what are you doing?
I just, I really...

No, I just want to say...

I'm really gonna miss you guys.
Okay, I'm not gonna cry twice in one year.
That is revolting.
It's too late.
Come on.
Bring it in, guys.
I like hugging now!
God, I hate...

Welcome aboard manila air.
Flight 518.
Evie?
I knew I should have worn my bib today.
What are you doing here?
I-I could ask you the same thing.
Well, I'm headed to my next post in the philippines.
You must be in the wrong seat, 'cause they told me.
This one's reserved for our new logistics coordinator.
That would be me.
Excuse me?
Yeah, they, they said in my interview.
That doctors without borders has 60 posts across the world.
What are the chances.
That we'd both be bound for the philippines?
Is it chance?

Of every decision we've ever made?
I thought a lot about what you said in iceland,
And, um, you were right.
I'm here right now.
Because four months ago I made a decision.
To get soda from a vending machine.
Well, that must have been a great soda.
There's more to it.

At a hospital here, and, I had the strangest conversation.
With this guy by the vending machine.
He said that I looked burned out, and I said I was,
And...

That your time was limited?
When was this?

September 15.
And I know for sure, because I applied.
For doctors without borders that night.
Hey, thanks for the talk, man.
You're welcome, mate.
Wow, you're not gonna believe this, but i...
I know that guy.
Good evening.

I stand here before you with some alarming news.
An asteroid known as 2000-wx-354.
Is currently on a collision course with the earth.
What did she just say?
Representatives...
From every space agency in the world,
The best and the brightest this planet has to offer,
Have assembled here in washington.
Holy nuts!
That's my cuz!
With their help,
We will work day and night.
To divert or destroy this asteroid.
And to ensure the collective survival.
Of humankind.
Attention, ladies and gentlemen,
We have some bad news.
Unfortunately...
We've misplaced our bottle opener,
So beverage service will be slightly delayed.
We apologize for this inconvenience.
