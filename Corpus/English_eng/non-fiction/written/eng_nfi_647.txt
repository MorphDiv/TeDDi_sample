Hi.
- Hey.

What are you working on?
Nothing.

- Eggs.

I don't understand you.

Tell me that you're drinking out of the carton again.
Frank, Jesus Christ, what did you do?
- Oh, shit.

- I just nicked it before and...

- Look at you.

Will you put this... oh, my god, put this in there.
Ugh, it's all over the floor.
Ahem.
Sorry, baby.
- Who's, uh, fizzy?

That's my, uh, my girlfriend from work.
Just one of the other nurses.
- Oh, yeah?

Here.
- Eat.

Will you let me look at this, please?
I'm fine, really.

Take that off of there and let me see it.
Gina, I'm good.

- Okay.

I'm good.
- You're a scootch.

All right, I gotta head out and, uh, get some things done today, so I'm gonna get ready.
- All right.

Yeah.

Oh.
Shit, I forgot that's today.
You all right?
Yeah, I think so.

I guess.
Yeah, I'm good.

Did you hear back from your mom yet at all?
- No.

- Yeah.

At this point, she's just being mean.
She's being a bitch.
How many times can your own son call you and you don't call him back?
Ugh.

Yeah.
It's your call.
Hey, I love you.
Okay.
- I said I love you.

All right, do your thing.

Kiss it.
Okay.
- Frank - hey.
- Been a while.

- How you doing?

Nah, just ice water is fine.
- Ice water?

Whatever you say.

Ahem.
How you doing?
Yeah, I'm doing all right.
It's a good game.

I've been working nights.
What do you want, frank?
To talk.
Just to see you.
It's been five years, you know?
Five quiet years.
Things are different, Charlie.
Why?

No.

God, I can barely look at the stuff anymore.
I'm even thinking about...
Becoming a counselor or something.
Me, right?
Yeah.
Gina's doing good.

She, uh, she's a nurse.
She's doing great, actually.
She's cooking a lot now.
Like mom used to.

- Yeah.

Your mother neither.
I don't think we ever did.
So what's there to talk about?
Right.
All right.
All right.
I'll let...

Hey, frank, take it easy.
Was hoping I'd find you here.
Get off my fucking truck, Travis.
Are you stupid?
Oh, like I'm going to fucking make any more damage.
What's up?
Just wanted to hang out.

Um...
Yeah, whatever.
Can I have a cigarette?
That's my lighter.
Old man in there?
Yep.
How's he doing?
He's all right.
Same old cock?
Sorry.
All right, what?

All right, well, I hate to bug you about it, but I kind of need to know where you're landing on this whole helping me out thing.
- Aw, come on, huh.

Listen, the vig's gonna go up.

Come on, man, I need your help.
- When?

Listen, you can help me out or you can push me around in a wheelchair the rest of your life.
I don't give a fuck about that.
I wouldn't push you anywhere.
All right, that's it though, Travis, really.
No more, okay?
Yeah, sure.

I'm serious, man.

- I know.

Hey, I got time for a couple of drinks.

- No, I gotta go to work.

No, I gotta go.
Gina.
G!
You fucking kidding me?
Gina, fucking stop.

- Sorry.

Trying to get a couple of hours of sleep in this morning, you know?
- All right, sorry.

Um, oh, did you pick up my prescription yesterday?
Oh, shit.

I went over there yesterday to get it and the pharmacy said that it's expired.
You need to call into the doctor's office.
Ah, shit, really?
Yeah.

Sorry.

- No.

They said you have two that are expired.

You need to get them both refilled.
What's the other one for?
It's the headaches.

You have two now?
Yeah.

Well, yeah, I'm going to work.
You better call the doctor's office now 'cause it's gonna be tough for you to get an appointment last minute like that.
I will.

Yes, babe.

Bills keep piling up.

What do you want me to tell you?
Are we going out later now?
No.

I'm gonna hang out with him.
Okay, well, Travis is hanging out with us.
Because it's Veronica's birthday and we're all getting together.
So I'll assume that that means yes.
All right.

- Go back to sleep.

I love you.
- Get some rest before you go into work.

I gotta get going.
All right.
I love you.

If you could get me in some time today, that would be ideal.
I'm sorry, ma'am, I really don't.

Ma'am, just let me, um, if... is...
Can I get in tomorrow by any chance?
Is there any openings?
Well, that's really none of your business.
Sorry.

Look, the doctor knows me.

Can you just tell him it's...
Ma'am, fucking...
Can you just...

What's that?
Look, can you get me in...
Can you make an appointment for next week then?
And then let me know if there's any openings coming up and then I can jump in if it's possible.
Why not?

I cannot wait another week.
All right.

That's good.

Hey, look who finally showed up.
- I'm sorry.

Yeah, frank.

- Okay.

A little bit.

And somehow Travis manages to make it on time.
Because Travis loves dollar drafts.
- That's why he's here early.

- Leave him alone.

Thanks.
I don't, uh...
I don't understand why you think it's cool being here right now.
Babe, it's fine.
What's the problem?

Yeah, so's the chip.
- Yeah, this is better.

Yes.

- Okay.

- And they have pool.

- Let's play.

- Hey.

- You all right?

What's the matter?

- I'm fine.

Mm-hmm.
- I'm good.

All right.

Come on.

Why am I here?
Whatever you can do with this mess I've created.
Figure something out.
Sorry, guys.

- What's up?

Frank and I gotta take care of something, okay?
- You, too?

- You guys just got here.

- All right?

Mm-hmm.

Okay.

- It doesn't, uh...

It doesn't go like that.
I know, but I don't like doing the bass.
I like it higher.

It's never gonna give up.
- Never gonna let you down.

- Yeah.

- Yeah, you are.

Been listening to that song for years.

- Desert you.

No, it is.

You come around to hurt.

You ain't gonna run around and desert either.
- It's run around...

It doesn't have to fucking make sense.
They should be here any minute anyway.
Hurt you's first.
There they are.
Holy shit.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Hey, Mickey.

Travis.

Frank.

Yeah.

Is that you frank?
How you doing, Mick?
This is frank?
Yeah.

Been good.
Yeah.

Last I heard, you met some broad and you settled down.
Yeah.

Yeah.

Things change, huh?
So.

- I couldn't tell you.

Celia and I got divorced a couple of years ago.
Crystal?

Still a pain in the ass.

Did a stint in rehab, you know.

What are you gonna do?

Frank.

- Who the fuck is this guy?

- Something funny over there?

- I mean I'm funny sometimes.

- Oh, stop it, man.

- Who the fuck you talking to?

- Chill out, okay?

Hey, shh.

You and me.

Bitch.
Hey, it's the black guys!

I'm afraid of black people.
That's good.

Hey, I'm good.

We gotta fucking deal with these fucking moulinyans?
- What the fuck did you say?

- Fuck you, man.

It's me.

It's my money, all right?

Let me taste that, okay?
- We cool?

- It's right there.

Be cool, man.

Good.

It's white?
All right.

- All right.

It looks good.

Oh, yeah.
That's bomb.
Oh, fuck!

Niko!

- What the fuck was that?

Hey.

Wait for the next call.
Go.

- They just fucking shot him.

Fuck.

How the fuck do you know Mickey?
- Just drive.

I fucking brought Dante in and they fucking killed him, they just fucking shot him for no fucking reason.
Stupid fucking...

Pull over at the stop sign.
- Quit talking.

- I ain't fucking stopping.

I'm fucking pulled over.

You want to play with the big boys?

- He fucking owns you now.

Hey, Donny.

Fucking embarrass me in front of my girl?

You owe me money.
I don't give a fuck what you told me.
You fucking kidding me?

Seriously?

I got that.

- Oh.

Where'd you get a stack like this?
You finally decide to suck dick?
- Yeah, I said it.

Go fuck yourself, Donny.
Yeah, how much do I gotta pay you?
Hello?
Hey.

Must be a full moon tonight.

How're you doing?

Just watching the game.
Top of the fourth, already two errors.
Yeah, they're hot and cold lately.

I know.
Hey, it was really good seeing you yesterday.
Yeah.

Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something.
I wish I was different back then.
I wish, uh...
I wish I could see the damage...
That I was doing.
To you and...
And to mom and myself.

I...
I, uh, well, I...
It took a long time for me to realize it, and I want you to know that I understand.
And, uh...
I'm...

For everything.
I just want you to know that...
That I know.

All right?
Yeah, all right.
Hey, I was tearing apart my closet the other day and I came across, uh...
This game ball that I got from the district championships.
I don't know if you remember, but I went 4 for 4.
I can't remember if it was the tigers or if it was...
No, the reds.
Had a hell of a year.
Yeah, shit, the reds.

That was the game that Billy dabrowski tore his pants running for that foul ball.
Yeah.
That's right, yeah.
And his legs were stuck in the air and his bare ass was hanging out, remember?
Poor kid, I had to go pull his pants up for him.
Had everyone laughing.
Oh, man.
Oh, that was good times.

Yeah, I remember.
Yeah, me, too.

All right.

I got some stuff to do.

I just wanted to give you a call.
So I'll let you go back to the game and...
Maybe sometime I'll swing by the bar, you know, if that's okay.
Say hello, you know?
Yeah, that'd be good.
All right.
Good.

You, too.
All right.
Bye, dad.
Good-bye, son.
Hi.

Yeah, just tell 'em it's sergeant Pierce's son frank.
Morning, baby.
Afternoon.
Where did you go last night?
I just saw a couple of old friends.
Do we have any aspirin anywhere?
I don't know.

I'm not changing the subject.
You got in awfully late.
I know.
I just figured you were sleeping, g, that's all.
- No, I wasn't sleeping.

I was up all night wondering where you were.
- All right.

I just...
I just went out, that's all.
Okay.

- Frank, where?

Are you kidding me?
You're out till all hours of the night
- and you won't even tell me...

Sorry.
I'm sorry.
G.
Hey, I'm taking your car in later for those ball joints.

Fuck.
Come on, Fritz.
Come on, Fritz.
Come on, Fritz.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Okay.
Yo.

Hey, Joe.
How's Gina doing?
Why?
Just asking.
She's fine.
All right.
You believe this shit?
Fucking Fritz in the fourth fucked me.
You want a beer?
Never mind.
- You good?

Ah, sorry.

Sorry.
You know what was going down last night?
Of course not.
Why the fuck would I put myself in that situation?
You think I'm fucking retarded?
Are you good?

Look, I can't sit on that.
Yeah, right.
I'm sorry I can't.
- Frank, be serious.

I talked to the d.A.
And I'm going to the precinct tomorrow.
Frank, you kidding me?

I mean, don't be stupid.
I do know who we're dealing with and I don't give a fuck.
I gotta think of me and my wife, and that's it.
Come on, frank, this is me we're talking about.
Yeah, I know it's you.

That's how I got sucked into it.
I told you don't bring me into that stupid shit.

So that's it.

You're just gonna rat me out to the fucking d.A.'S office.
I'm not ratting you out.

I'm just letting you know that's what's going on.
Keep my name out of it.
That's gonna look real good.

I mean, fuck, he's going to come right out of prison,
- give me a thank you card, and fucking blow my head off.

Look, it's done.

I told you I'll keep your name out of it.

And don't you ever fucking ask me for anything else again.
No problem.
Fuck!
Jesus fuck.
I keep telling him we need to have people over more often.
I know.
I honestly can't even remember the last time I used this patio furniture.
It's so nice to just sit out here.
We should have this more often.
You should get the guys together and you guys can all come by.
- I know.

Yeah.

Oh, frank.

There he is.

Niko.

- I was in the neighborhood.

Niko says that you guys are old friends?
Yeah, we know a lot of the same people.
A couple of guys from back in the day, yeah.
Well, on that note, I am late to meet a friend, so I am going to head in, get ready.
I'll see you guys later.
Can I get you a refresh?
If I didn't know any better, frank,
I'd think your girl was trying to get me drunk.
Yeah.

Look, is that a yes?

Nah, I should be going.
Yeah.

She looks better going than coming.
You know, the way Mickey was talking,
I thought you were some sort of monster or something, like fucking charlize theron.
But look at this.

You're not a big tough guy.
You're a fucking pussy.
What the fuck do you want?
I'm making sure you're not doing something fucking stupid.
Like you coming here, motherfucker?
Mick heard you made a phone call.
That right?
Is that what he heard?
Yeah.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, sure you don't.
You know, it's best you forget some things, Frankie.
Like Mick forgot some things about you, too.
Get your fucking hand out of my face.
Hey, frank.
- Yeah?

Can you bring in the mail please?
Yeah, don't forget the fucking mail, frank.
- Frank, where are my car keys?

I told you I'm going to Veronica's.

Do me a favor, baby.
Don't let strangers in the backyard anymore, okay?
What are you talking about?

He's not a... any random guy says he's a friend of mine, you're gonna let him in the backyard?
You gonna cook him dinner, too?

Okay.

Do you?
Yes.

I don't like him.
I barely know him, and I just...
Please just don't anymore.

All right.

It doesn't matter.
I just said don't do it any more, okay?
We were out there for a couple of minutes before you got home.
Just get your head out of your ass, Gina, and don't fucking do it any more and if you ever see him again, just walk the other way, please.
Don't talk to me like that.
Gina, did you hear what I said?

- Yes, I heard you.

Did you hear what I said?

Don't fucking do it anymore.
What?
Where are my keys?
Where are my keys?
I'm sorry.

Fuck.

I took your car into the shop before, okay?
- Then I'm taking your truck.

- I'm taking your truck.

- Give them to me now.

Frank, I'm not doing this.

You blow a frigging gasket yesterday and now you put your hands on me?
Give me your fucking keys so I can go.

- Honey, just...

G.
Gina.
I'm really sorry, baby.

Fuck.
Fuck!
Shit.
You look classy in a pickup.
What happened to your car?
It's in the shop, so I have his.
Don't start.
- Can we take yours?

- Is it open?

I'll throw my stuff inside.
Let me guess.

Yeah.
Give me a second, all right?
All right.
Hello?
Why do you always say hello like that when you're pissed at me?
Look, I just got here, so I gotta go, all right?
Wait, wait, wait.

Baby, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what the hell got into me there.
You didn't deserve that.
No, I didn't.
Look, uh...
Let's talk.
Tonight, okay?
I love you so much.
I'm just really sorry, and I'll never do that again.
I'll take you out to dinner.
My treat.
Please.
Maybe we'll get a little ice cream or something.
Okay.
All right, I love you, too.
Hey, handsome.

Hey, yourself.

Hey, hold on one second.

- What's that?

- Long time no see.

- G. Gina, who's...

Gina, who is that?
- Hey.

Hey, babe, hold on.

What friend, Gina?
- Gina, what friend?

Saw that pretty face.

Gina!
Sorry.

- Gina, what friend?

- Yeah.

- Gina.

Gina!
Niko, do you know frank's friend Travis, too?
Yeah, Travis, yeah.

Yeah, he is.

Anyway, I don't want to interrupt your call.
Shit, sorry.

Frank.

Are you still there?
G.
Gina!
Gina!
Babe?
Shit, I lost him.

Yeah, the reception is a bitch around here.
Yeah, it sucks.
Same thing happens to my fucking phone.
It's crazy.
Anyway, I'm sorry to hit and run.
Jesus Christ!
Gina!
Gina!
Hey, hey, hey.
Jesus Christ.

Hey, hey.

Hey, wake up.

Hey!

Stop, stop, stop.

Where is Gina?

- I don't know.

- Your friend.

Niko.
- What's going on?

- What?

I didn't talk to anybody.

Who'd you talk to?

- What?

- I didn't...

- I didn't talk to anybody.

How could they possibly know, Travis?
Dude, he's got half the force in his fucking pocket.
You don't think he's got the d.A.'S office either?
Ah, shit.
- Yeah, shit.

Listen, I'm gonna make some calls.
Where are you gonna be?

I don't know.
I'm gonna talk to Charlie.
All right.
Meet you there.
Hey, dad.

Hey, twice in one week.

Dad, listen.

What happened?
I promise I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything wrong, okay?
Okay.

I saw something that I shouldn't have seen.
And I tried doing the right thing.

I really did, dad, I tried making it better and it made it worse.

Tell me.

I didn't want to tell you.
I saw Mickey the other night.
Ah, fuck.

No, no, no!

Please.

And some shit went down the other night I had no part in.

And he fucking, to keep me quiet, he just kidnapped my wife.
Un-fucking-believable.

After everything I've done to help you, you're still hanging out with that scumbag?
I'm not hanging out with him.

- Keep it down over there.

I haven't seen him.

I just don't know what to do right now.

Frankie, I don't know what to tell you.
I got nothing else to give you.
- Dad.

- Dad, come on.

I don't know what to do.

Some things you're gonna have to figure out for yourself.
What do you mean figure out for myself?
Didn't you hear what I just fucking said?
Didn't you hear what I just said?
Take it easy.

That's my wife and I'm your fucking son.
- Let go of my arm, Frankie.

I'm your fucking son!
Frankie, stop!
Let him go, Frankie!
Stop!
Frank.
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
- Are you all right?

What are you fucking doing here?

Ow!

Are you lying to me?

- No!

Are you holding out on me?
No, I'm not!

When was the last time he called you?
- Fuck, I don't know.

No, he never... once, but he has a burner.
Don't you fucking lie to me, Travis!
He changes it every couple of days.

- I'm not lying to you.

- The guy that knows everybody.

He can get to him, okay?

He's at Bernie's.

You're gonna take me there right fucking now, you understand?
- Yeah.

- Ow!

You're an amazing singer.
You should see me sing rock ballads.
Donny.

My friend frank over here, he's kind of in a bad way, all right?
Just don't fuck with him.

Hey.

Hey, frank.

- Where can I find Mickey?

Slow your roll there, Tex.

Maybe you can buy me a drink and then you can get into my pants.
Maybe, if you buy me two,
I'll let you get into her pants.
Aah!
What are you doing, man?

I don't have time for bullshit, okay?
Listen to me.

I don't know where.
I mean I don't know where he is right now!
- He may be at cafe azzuro.

Cafe azzuro.

He gets a cappuccino and he likes it there.

- It's like clockwork there.

Yeah, it's in my phone.

Ahh!

His name is "asshole" in my phone!
Ow.

Shut the fuck up and come here!

What about his daughter crystal?
Yeah, yeah.

She's been hanging out at his club.

She's there every night.

If you are lying to me...

I'm not, man.

Ahh!

Yo, frank.

Go get a burner, and get to that alley across the street from azurro's.
And get there in the morning before he gets there.
- Frank.

- Don't fucking "wait" me.

- All right?

Keep your fucking phone on.
What's up slut?

Yeah, you missed a great night.

No, he was wasted again.

I'm on my way home.
But you are coming out tomorrow night, so wear something hot.
We are going to visage.
All right.

Oh, come on.

Ahh!

- Yo.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I got a new friend.
What are you talking about a new friend?
- I got crystal.

Oh, he's gonna listen now.
- Jesus Christ we need...

He's right where Donny said he'd be.
He's at the cafe.
Hmm, that's funny cause he's not picking up the phone, trav.
So, what do you wanna do?
What's he doing right now?
He's just talking to Niko.
All right, get him that burner.
Are you sure you wanna do it this way?
I mean...

We could just take her, drop her off somewhere.
She'll think she passed out.

Travis, I'm gonna text you when she wakes up.
Just get him that fucking burner.
Bobby.
Is that you?
Where are you?
Come on.
Untie me, Bobby.
I'm not into this anymore.
I told you no more hitting me.
My head is fucking killing me.
This isn't funny.
I'm not in the mood for this.
You're really starting to creep me out.
Bobby.
Untie me.

I'm not Bobby.
Shit!
No!
Shit!
No!
Fuck.
He reached across the counter and grabbed me...
I bet he fucking talked though.
I would've talked.

Who's this guy?
Where the fuck you going?
Yo, some dude gave me $50 to give this to your man with the suit.
What dude?

I don't know.

What the fuck are you doing?
Yo, chill man.

- Get the fuck out of here.

Somebody!
Let me out of here!
Let me out!
Please!

Help!
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Crystal.
- Stop.

Stop.

Can you tell me what you want with me?
Right now I just need you to keep your mouth shut.
This must be some kind of mistake.
Relax.
Are you Mickey duro's daughter?
Yeah.
Then there's no mistake.
Relax.
So here's what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna call your old man, and I'm gonna let you talk to him for about 5 seconds so he knows you're okay.
Don't try anything, all right?
All right?
Yeah.
Put Mickey on the phone.
Who the fuck is this?
Put Mickey on the fucking phone.
Wants to talk to you.
Yeah, who is it?
You know who this is, Mick.
Look, I don't have a clue who this is.
So just get to it, okay?

You got something of mine, Mick.
Look, I have a lot of things that people want, okay?
You're gonna have to be a bit more specific there, dude.
This something doesn't belong to you.
That's where you're mistaken.

If I have it, it's mine.
Pussy.

If you can get it out of my pocket, well, that's a different story, but right now, that shit belongs to me.
Well, if that's the case, then I can say the same thing to you.
Daddy?
Crystal?

I don't know what the hell's going on here, but... ahh!
Crystal!

Do I have your attention now, Mick?
I'm gonna kill every motherfucker you know!
Every motherfucker you know!
And let you live, you cocksucker.
Hey, Mickey.
Now you're gonna listen to me.
Just like the old times, right?
Ahh!

Sorry.
He just slammed the burner on the ground.
Now he's bee-lining it out of there.
It's on now.
Travis.

Travis.
Hey.
Thirsty?
Look, it's gonna be a long day.
So just relax a little bit, okay?
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I never was.

You all right?
- You sure?

Sorry.
You want more?
What does that mean?

Interpret that for me.
No, no, no, no, no.
It means, I wish I hadn't been caught.
Motherfucker.

There you go, you motherfucker.
Motherfucker.
Now I thought you and I had an understanding.
You mixed up in this shit?
Are you a part of this mess?
You're not gonna waste my time, are you?
You're not gonna waste my time.

So where are frank and my daughter?

I don't know.
No?
No.
How long have you known...
Wow.

Huh?
A few years.
- Yeah?

Yeah.
You know, frank and I used to work together.
- Did you know that?

Things were good when we were together.
He knew how to handle people without any repercussions.
He was like my kid, you know?
But frank was born with a, I don't know, a bad bone in him.
He was just born bad, you know?
Yeah, I fucking know.
No, you don't.
But you're gonna find the fuck out.
You don't know shit about him.
He was a very bad seed long before I ever met him.
Did you know he was in the military?
It was either that or prison.
Aggravated assault.

So he picked the marine corp.
He was doing pretty good over there, too, for a couple of years, but then he broke some guy's jaw over in Japan.
Broke his neck.
By accident!
By accident.
Marines wouldn't do nothing for him, so they locked him up.
Parents had to fucking remortgage their house just to get him enough money to get him a lawyer.
Why the fuck are you even telling me this, Mick?
What the fuck's it got to do with me, huh?
And he loves her.
You got every right to cry.
'Cause when I show him this picture...
Hang on.

That's your cock going in his wife's ass.
When I show him this picture, you know what he's gonna do to you?
Imagine all the pain in mankind.
He's gonna give it to you as a gift and keep you alive to give it to you every day.
Now, he ain't seen it yet.

So I'm your god from this moment forward.
You address me as god.

I ain't sent it to him yet.
Say "thank you, god." Come on, say it.
Say it, motherfucker!

- Thank you, god.

Motherfucker!

- Thank you, god.

I'll make you feel like a fucking bitch!
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!
I'll kill you, motherfucker.

Get the fuck over here, you fucking piece of shit.
I'll kill you, you fucking goddamn motherfucker.
That's my fucking daughter, you goddamn motherfucker!
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.
Look at me.
Now say "thank you, god!"
You're with a fucking goddamn psychopath right now!
You're with me now!

You ain't in high school!
I gotta relax or I'll kill you by accident.

I need you to find my daughter, okay?
Okay?

Thank you, god.

Now we're getting somewhere.

His dad was a cop for a long time.

- Yeah.

- Kind of, yeah.

Just relax, all right?
Apple don't fall too far from the tree, you know?
His father wrote the book on police brutality.
So they scraped together every dime they had, his family did, and they paid off the right people and he was home in a year.
There was a big fucking party.
Frank comes home and he broke some fucking guy's eye socket who said some smart-ass shit about him happened over there.
But he got lucky.

The guy threw the first punch.
You get it?

I fear him.
Now, when I show him this...
You will wish you never were born.
He is gonna give you something no one has ever fucking known about.
- And he ain't gonna let you die.
Okay, he's gonna cut off your arms, your legs, your fucking eyes, pull your fucking arms off, your dick, and then put you in the corner, but keep your brain intact, though.
Put you in the corner like a fucking plant and piss on you, you get it?
He thought that up.
But look at me.
I was his boss!
You motherfucker!

I'll kill you, motherfucker!
I'll kill you!
I don't know.
- I don't know.

Okay?

I'll eat you.
Now you look at me, motherfucker.
I'm gonna ask you one time.
You're in fucking hell, you fucker!
Something happens to my daughter, you motherfucker...
Now you listen to me.
You answer this question!

- I don't know.

I believe you.
- I believe you.

I believe you.

Shut the fuck up, motherfucker, or I'll fucking kill you.
I believe you.

We gotta find my daughter.

I don't like doing this shit, you know?
I'd rather get my cock sucked.

Huh?

Travis, pull yourself together.
Frank only calms down when he drinks.
Now is he drinking?

- Okay.

What am I gonna do with you?

You gonna help me find him?
Thanks.
You're welcome.
You used to hang around with my dad a lot.
I had a crush on you when I was a kid.
Did you know that?
You did?
Come on.
Yeah, I remember you.
So you're not gonna hurt me.
No.
No.
Are you gonna hurt my dad?
Yeah.
You don't know your dad too well, do you?
Your dad and me used to be real close,
- well, you know.

When we used to work together.
You were at the, uh...
Trucking company.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Your mom one time was, uh...
Outside the house when I came home early, and I actually got your mom to smoke weed with me.
Shut up.
Never would've thought that, huh?
- I don't know.

No.

Yeah, I got your mom high.
Yeah, is that all you did?
- Yes.

- You better.

She was great.

- Yes.

And she's the reason actually why I got that firebird.
- Do you remember that car?

- Yeah, that was your mom.

We were driving by a dealership one day, me, her, and your father, and it just caught my eye.
I was like, "that car is beautiful."
- It was a beautiful car.

She convinced your dad to pick it up for me for Christmas one year.
I, uh, I used to sit in it when you used to come over to the house.
- Did you really?

- You little runt.

- The t-tops.

Yeah, I thought I was awesome.
You were awesome.

I remember.
I remember.
And I remember my dad.
He, uh, he really cared about you.
Hmm.
And then, well, you just stopped coming around.
Yeah, I did.
That sucked.
Your father was, uh...
- He was a user.

I trusted him.
I lost two years of my life...
For your dad because I kept my mouth shut.
And I lost my family and I lost everything because of him.
And what happened when you got out?
I met my wife at aa.
- Cheers.

My dad took her, didn't he?
Yeah.
Why?
Why are you trying to make me mad for?
Why are you trying to wind me up?
I wanna know.
'Cause he's scared.
Is that why you took me?
Hmm?
- Maybe.

Well,
I'm kind of glad you did.
Are you?
Mm-hmm.
So...

- Hmm.

Now, I'm gonna finish this bottle with you.
Mm-hmm.

Fuck.
Clean yourself up with that towel there.
Hang on.
Un-fucking-believable.

Fucking bald headed prick.
You want a drink?

Yeah.
Gina.
I was pretty sure you didn't know who frank was.

What do you think?
You think she does?
I'm gonna go tell her.
- Was he ital...

Does he have to be?
I, uh...
What?
I have to pee.
You gotta what?

I have to pee.
I've been down here for a long time.
All right.
Well, unfortunately we don't have a bathroom, so...
That's what you got.
Sorry.
It's all right.
- You sure?

- Really?

Okay.
All right.
All right.

Don't go running off on me.
Okay.
I don't wanna hurt you.
Mmm.
Oh, that feels really good.
All right.
Those are staying on.
Don't go running on me, and I'll tell you what.
- Okay.

I'm not gonna watch.

I'm gonna sit over here and sing a happy tune all to myself.
You're gonna do your thing.
- I'll just hang out.

- Okay?

Would you like to hear a certain song?
I have a great voice, I've been told.
- Yeah?

I don't know.

I could use a little help.
From me?
What kind of help do you need?
You gotta take 'em off?
That's what you need help with?
Uh-huh.
Yeah?
Frank?
Frank, are you home?
Frank!
You home?
Frankie?
Frankie, it's dad!
Who are you?
Friend of the family.
You frank's dad?
Yeah.
You know where he is?
No.
No?

How do you know frank?
We have a mutual friend.
Mickey duro.
Mickey, huh?
You better pray that sick fuck doesn't touch my daughter, bitch, or I'll cut your fucking jaw off with a hacksaw, okay?
Cunt.
Oh, yeah!
Stop.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Hey.
- Trav?

Yeah, it's me.
Hey, look, man, what do you say we end this, okay?
You know, we each got something the other guy wants, so let's just call it even, man.
You know, call it quits.

Yeah, I'm ready when you are.
Really?

Usual place?
Yeah.
How's Gina?
She's a little banged up, you know.
Niko caught her pretty good, but she'll be okay.

Yeah, she's a little banged up, too.
I'll see you in an hour.
Don't be late.
Who was that?
That was your dad.
What's with you?
That never happened.
- You understand?

Do I look like I'm joking?
You don't say anything to anybody.
- Okay?

You a big girl?

- Hmm?

Okay.
'Cause I'll find out who you love and I will gut them like a fucking fish, cutie.
Ah, frank.
The woman you love.
My dad is gonna fucking kill you.
Now you're gonna see who you're really married to.
Come on, baby.
It's okay, it's okay, come on.

Come here, you motherfucker.

Get the fuck out of there.

All right, relax.

Huh?

I said walk!
Don't cry.

Ain't no crying in baseball, ain't no crying in dying.
Except for this motherfucker right here.
Get the fuck down.

I'll blow your motherfucking head off, you know that?
Don't fucking move.
Come on, bitch.
Motherfucker.

No!
You like that?

Hey, frank.

I'll blow this bitch's brains right the fuck out.
You better relax, motherfucker.

Slow.
Hey, frank, I said slow.
Goddamn it, leave her...
Hey, baby, you okay?

I get it.

- Honey, you okay?

Hey, frank, come on.
- It's over.

Hey, frank.

Did you ever think we'd be across from each other like this?
I mean, all the things we've been through together?
Come on, what are we doing?
All right, look, I admit it.

I did.
- But I had to send a message.

Hey, hey, hey, come on.
You talked, man.

Come on, frank.

Can I just go?

Yeah, let her go.

It's over.

No, no, no, no.

No!

That's my daughter, motherfucker, you let her go!
Goddamn it!
Stop it.
Frank, stop it.

I've got nothing.
You took everything from me, Mick.
Okay, look.
- Daddy, da...

We are.

Frank, she's not.
Just... just...

Let my daughter go, please.
And if I got nothing...
Frank.
Come on, frank.
Then Mick...
You got nothing!
You know I'd like to see if we could, maybe try to work things out.
Hey, you've reached frank and Gina.

Leave us a message.
Frank.
It's your mom.
I'm sorry I haven't called you back.
Actually I'm glad you didn't pick up.
I'm just not ready to talk to you yet.
You're not right, Frankie.
I'm sorry.

But please don't call me again.
