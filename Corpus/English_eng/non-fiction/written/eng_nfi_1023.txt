What's this about?

Police think it's an extortion racket.
Is it my mother's?
You trusted them?

There is no-one you can trust!
I know what you are.
I know what you did with the van.
Where can you go where you'll be safe?
I'm not buying her.

You come near me again, I'll kill you!
Murder weapon?

Metal bar would do it.
Wear this.

A267.

94 kilometres to Charing Cross.
It's not a password.

Please!

When will I see him?
Please, I have no more money...
Where is he?

When will I...?
Oh, please!
THEY MOAN AND HIT THE WALLS
SOFTLY SINGING
FOGHORN BLASTS
PA: 'Ladies and gentlemen, we will shortly be arriving at Dover.
'Le ferry est sur le point de partir.
'Les passagers sont pries de se rendre sur les points...'
Please.
Please.

Do we have any idea who these dead people are?
No, not yet.

Trafficking?

I need Butler in the loop.
I think these deaths are related to the killings in London.
You think that?

The London victims are recent.
Both of my London victims had the A-road location marker in messages in their phone.
How are they involved?
I don't know.
Ugh, no signal.
You have to...

Out to the road?

I walked out to the road.
I'm not a thief.
Can you work for a place to stay?
Was it a mistake?
They know when the van passed through Dover, did they die en route?
Two murdered men knew the location.
So someone kills Jamal al Sham and Kali Aziz to keep the van hidden.
Did they know?

Why would you hide it?
Because you open the doors when you arrived and found the people inside were dead.
You didn't know what to do, so you hid the van.
No.
The panels of the van were pressed out.
You can see where they kicked and pounded the doors.
If it happened en route, the driver would have known.
Someone would have noticed.

No, they were alive when they got here.
Hidden in the trees and left to die, slowly.
In a metal prison they thought was going to save them.
Assalamu alaikum.
Wa alaikum assalaam.
Zakat.
Thanks for your help and everything you do.
Written in blood?

DNA.
Police.
Do you rent rooms here?
Yeah?

What's your name?
Fred.
We found this address written next to the body of a gentleman who had passed away, Fred.
We have a facial reconstruction.
Do you recognise him?
No.
We have a warrant to search these premises, would you open the door, please?
OK.

Thank you.
He's running.
Go!
You all right?

We did this.
We locked them in the back of the van and left them to die.
We created the problem and then we slammed the door.
Oh, God.
Teeth marks.
We made them beasts.
The beasts are the people that put them in the van, Nikki.
Gave them false hope and took their money.
And then their humanity.
If people migrate illegally, then they put themselves in danger.
Hobson's choice.

We've consistently said we will help refugees, just only from a camp.
Then we've been consistently inhuman.
There are 14 million of them...

What, we, we just take them all?
Take them in or leave them to die?

Nikki, we can't afford it.
What is it?
Someone's dreams of the future.

They don't want to be a burden, Thomas.
They want to be safe.
Where are you coming from, sir?
Calais, but I'm from Belgium.
You are...

No, I'm not.
Began your journey in Belgium?
Yeah.
Is this your van?
Aboon Dbashmayo...
No, actually, I borrowed it from a friend.
Nethcadash shmokh...
You borrowed it?
Yes.

Nehwe sebyonokh...
Are you aware of your customs allowances, sir?

May we take a look in the back, please?
Sure.
Can you pull into the inspection bay, please, sir.

His brother was in the van.
Does he know?
Those from the van?

Bad choice of words.

They're charging.
I cross checked the address books, numbers received and numbers dialled on our two victims,
Jamal and Kali's phones...

And they had each other's numbers.
One French mobile number in common, under the letters YH.
One English mobile number in common, marked AW.
Both have the MemoWire messenger app.
Hmm.
ALL PHONES BLEEP/VIBRATE WITH MULTIPLE NEW MESSAGES
What should we do, Jack?
Jack?
The messages are being sent by the phones I found in the van.
"Please, in the name of God, don't let us die this way."
They were locked in the back of the van.
No signal in the forest, the messages didn't send.
Batteries ran out searching for signal.
"Help us.

Messages from the dead.
But this world... it's nothing.
Soiled, meaningless.
We must say to the kafir as the Koran has taught us - you have rejected the truth, so, sooner or later...
PHONE RINGS
..a punishment will come.
MULTIPLE PHONE ALERTS
Turn that off, please.
Off!

Sorry.
Afternoon, chaps.

All right, gents.

Load it back up.
Thank you for your time, sir.

DOORS CLOSE
ENGINE FIRES, VAN MOVES
I told you to turn that off in the church.
I need to find her.
My mother, she is alive.
TEXT ALERT
What is it?
Akka just received a message from her mother.
Restores your faith in the universe.
This was four weeks ago at Dover customs control.
We don't get a clear view of the driver from the video, but, from the time stamp, we managed to retrieve his passport.
Alan Wilson.
He's from Croydon.
He was a youth offender, convicted of grievous bodily harm and sent down for seven months.
His exact whereabouts at the moment are unknown...
It seems likely the van came through Dover and was secreted and abandoned soon afterwards.
All seven victims in the van died of hypertonic dehydration.
Lack of fluid.
It takes between three and five days to die.
Depending on your general health.
All right, he parks the van amongst the trees and... goes?
Was Jamal or Kali Aziz meant to collect the van and the people in it?
We don't know the answer.
Alan Wilson does.
Fingerprints, rear panel of the van...
Brian Hunt.
Works for Border Force.
Mr Hunt?
How much do you lot get paid?
New?

Pia Butler.

I'm helping the police investigate the deaths of seven people.
The ones in the van?

Yeah, I heard.

Shouldn't have happened.

They came through Dover?

And I was the Duty Officer?
Did you look in the van?
A white van?

Not always.

Your fingerprints were on the rear handle.
Well, then I looked.

Well, then I didn't.
It really is a very nice car.
Look, I can see what you're trying to do and say without saying it.
I'm not bent.

And you are well out of order.
You know, when I spoke to HR, they told me you gave your notice in.
Yeah.

Seems like the job's been good to you.
Have you ever had to pull a migrant out of the crawl space of a lorry - someone who's risked their lives to get where you're standing - and then send them on to some overcrowded immigration referral centre?
Every day.
Well, I got tired of shattering someone else's dreams.
And one day, so will you.
So you decided to look the other way?
You broke the law.
Well, good luck with that.
Because if I don't find anything, then I don't find anything.
I guarantee you, the seven victims we found, they wished you had.
Blood on the iron bar found in the skip matches Kali Aziz.
Injuries to the victim are blunt force made with a linear object.
It's the murder weapon.

We lifted a clean print from the bar, yes?
Yep.

You outdid yourself.

Alan Wilson, when was he in prison?
2008.

It's Wilson's prints on the van.
And the iron bar.
What's up?
I put Akka's DNA onto the database when we checked the tissue.
She is the mother of Akka Khoury.
What, so Akka received an old message when they came through today?
And believed that...

Do you want me to..?

I'll tell her.
The person who's extorting money from Akka's family, they'd have known her mother was dead in the back of a van.
DRIVER GETS OUT
Elia Khoury, Akka's mother, was one of the deceased.
She was dead for a month while money was extorted from her family.
Whoever did this used the van as a prison.
Jack?

Likely to be the same person or persons.
Sorry, I was waiting on the e-mail, just came in.
Blood on the cuff of Gyearbuor Asante's sweatshirt.
DNA match with Alan Wilson.

Asante's brother was in the back of the van.
They were extorting from him as well.
DRIVER GETS IN
ENGINE FIRES
She's alive!
I wrote her, but she didn't respond...
I need to find her.
What should I do?
I don't want to go to the police.
What should I do?
VAN STOPS
DRIVER GETS OUT
My brother, Eapen?
We found a young boy in the back of the van.
My aunt?
My cousin?
My uncle?
It doesn't really look like her.
Assalamu alaikum.
Wa alaikum assalaam.
Where's Jamal?
I don't know.

No, I went round to Kali.

Tried to call him, a woman answered.

I haven't heard from him.
I got some messages today.
Old messages.
Seen the news?
I saw.
Messages from those people.
Messages from the dead.
I have to go.

How did this happen?
Ask Jamal.

No, I tried.

You were the driver.

They were kafirs.

Every one of them was a kafir.

It's what they deserve.
Well, they don't have to worry about that now, do they?
Did Jamal and Kali do this?
I don't know what happened.
The van was parked in dense woodland, that's what it said in the paper.
Someone must have driven it there.
Now, I sent a van yesterday, did you meet it?
I thought Kali was meeting it.
Now, why would you think that?

Are they safe, Abdul?

Are they safe?

"Those who reject Faith after they accepted it,
"never will their repentance be accepted..."
Only Allah can change the essence of a man, who he is.
I am a true believer.
Business is something we accept, but a person who could do this?
Let go of me, you filthy kafir.
That person is an insult to the Prophet.
That person is not a slave to Allah, Abdul.
That person is an impostor.
Your mother brought these with her to help you start a new life.
They belong to you.
Take them.
You have my brother here?
Go inside.

Who is your brother?

Do you have him here?
If your brother is here, the police will need you to identify him.
No police.

Open the door.

What is wrong with you English people, huh?
Do you not feel nothing?
Give him to me...

They killed him.
He was a sweet, good man and they killed him for money.
Please.

I need to bury my brother so he can rest in peace.
We can't release his body to you until the police say we can.
I'm sorry...

They took money from me.
They said he would be safe.
Then tell the police and give your brother justice.
You don't understand.
They've been looking for you.
I told them the news.
God bless you all.
Where is Elia?
You said she had gone to get her mother.
Where is she?
Where?
Akka?
Elia is dead.
Eapen is dead.
They died a month ago in the back of the van that brought them here from Calais.
That's not true.
I'm sorry.
I will kill them.
I will find them and I will kill them!
Liar!
Why did you say she was alive?
She thought she was.

No!

She's lost her mother...

Only a coward would hurt her.
I'm not a coward.
Come with me.

Make sure you're looked after.

Come with me.
Please.
It is how they are.
Akka, you can't accept how they are.

Akka...
THEY SHOUT "HELP" REPEATEDLY
BANGING AND SHOUTING CONTINUES
Have you logged all the messages?
I did Jamal al Sham's phone yesterday.
And I was just checking the Kali Aziz phone and I found another message.
A new road marker location?
Another van?
DIALLING
Detective Chief Inspector?

We potentially have another van.
DISTANT BANGING AND CRIES FOR HELP
BANGING AND SHOUTING CONTINUES
Kafir.
"I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve.
"Therefore, strike off their heads
"and strike off every fingertip of them."
HE SCREAMS
RADIO: 'Suspect vehicle reported moving into wooded area 'adjacent to A2 near Faversham.'
Come on!

You want to get in left here.
That's it.
Get out.

Bisur'a!

Run!
Run.

There.

PHONE RINGS
Arrived.

No blues and twos.
What do you want to do?
Mr Yusuf?
Run.

Police!
Detective!
Shit.
Ah...
Did you see anything?
Bodies in the van?
No.
Alan Wilson?
Did he do it?

Who let him out?
Presumably, Alan Wilson's killer.
He let them out?

He let them go.
The killer took photos of the body, and sent them to Jamal al Sham and Kali Aziz.
He is YH.
He doesn't know they're dead.

The brutality's a warning.
I'll get a tent up.
Armed police!
Clear.
Detective?
Yusuf Hamed.
It's clean.
Hmm.
Why is that?
The rest of the place is a tip.
Smell bleach?
Uh-huh.

Hello.
Yeah.
Hold that.
Oh, God.
Let's see.
Another migrant?
Thanks.
Jack?
She's missing a finger.
Stay here, sleep.
There'll be trains from that station in the morning.
No!
I don't want you with me.
You'll slow me down.
He sat here all night.
He will not speak.
Varkey?
There is no God.
It's all a lie.
Leave me.
There he is.

We were looking for Janna.
He murdered Jamal.
Yes, but we're short on the evidence to prove it.
This is a ledger of money he collected from his victims.
He left them in the van to die, but kept giving their families hope in order to extort more money from them.
He went rogue.

Where did the money go?
Zakat.
Charity.
"True Faith Academy"?
They take your mind and your money.
Let's go, we have to find him.
Yula, come on, let's go.
Why did you let him hit me?
I'm going.
Are you coming with me?
I'm going.
From Abdul Al Wilson's notebook,
I was able to get into his MemoWire account and see the history.
The trafficking seems to have been well established.
And it IS Yusuf Hamed's business.
Wilson was simply exploiting a desperate situation.
There does seem to be a form of coded language that preceded payment and the arrangements being made.
What was it?
"A friend needs your help.
"They have money."
MESSAGE ALERT
He's confirmed.
I'm going to have him.
Where are your grandfather and your brother?
They are gone.
I'm sorry.
It's how they are.
Akka!
Sosa!
Her cousin.
She was separated from Elia and Eapen in the chaos.
She's alive today because of it.

Hasn't talked about it.

Not to me.
Thank you.
No-one ever says that.
They're both under 16?
Yes.
No parents here?
They're cousins.

Sosa's are unaccounted for.
They I think they'll qualify for asylum.
We passed the hat, bought them a few clothes.
Oh, thank you.
Twice in one day.
Hey, hey, shh, it's OK.
Just got you some clothes.
I'm going to come see you tomorrow.
How did you get out?
There was a man... ..called Mr Yusuf.
HE NERVOUSLY FLICKS THE LIGHTER
INAUDIBLE
Stand by.
Contact made.
Can't see him.
On my signal.
No...
No!
This is Butler.

We have a male with a stab wound to the back and to the chest.
Yusuf Hamed.

41 years old.
British.
It's very important that you don't use the guest house for a bit.
Don't even come to the house.
Do you think they found her?
He's confident, careful, and forensically aware.
I'd be very surprised if he hadn't killed before.
Your sister's carrying my child.
If she was to play happy families with a junkie, that's her prerogative.
If they found out that you were in the area, we all know how quickly they jump to conclusions.
What about you, Ellie?
Are you jumping to any conclusions?
