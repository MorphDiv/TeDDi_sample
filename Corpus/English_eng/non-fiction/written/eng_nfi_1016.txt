there he is.
Jesus.

Come on.

I don't want him to think I don't care about time and stuff.
There's my girl.
There's my dad.
Dad, this is my boyfriend Martin.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Martin.
Uh, Mr. gallo.

You're Mr. gallo.
I know that.
Nice to meet you, Martin.
Fuck.
It's really good to see you.
You look great.
You look tired.

Singapore.

Ever been?
No, I haven't been.
Uh, i-

I also hear that they cane you if you spit in the street.
Uh, not that I like that.

Good evening.

Shall we start with a nice bottle of red?
Uh, Martin has a sulfite allergy.
A sulfite allergy?
Um, it's not that bad, actually.
I just get a little, uh, hivey.
But I'm fine with water or death.
Okay.

Excellent choice.
And, Martin, are you sure?

Maybe a beer?

Heh.
You sure you don't want something else, Martin?
Mm.

These beets are really well steamed.
I'm sorry.

He hates me.
He doesn't hate you.
He hates me.
He hates me so much, I'm starting to hate myself.
All that matters is what I think, and I'm a fan.
Yeah?
Big fan.
Huge fan.
All right.
Martin:

I'll bounce back.
Round two.
Sorry about that.
It's, uh, not a problem.
Looks like a, uh, pretty major deal just went down over there by the bar, huh?
So, Martin, what is it that you do?
Uh, dad, I told you Martin is a musician.
Right.

Uh, it's the, uh, banjo.
Banjo.

Heh.

Well, i have a band, hysterical kindness.
It's a bluegrass collective, more flatt and scruggs or punch brothers than some, you know, poppy mumford  sons kind of wannabe thing.
What's wrong with mumford  sons?
They're a very successful act, no?
He likes mumford  sons.
So where you from?
Well, I was born in Chicago, uh, but I grew up in guelph.
Guelph?
Uh, guelph, Ontario.
Guelph?

Canada.
Guelph?
Okay.
Your folks, what do they do?
Jesus, dad, what is with the third degree?
Third degree?

You don't mind, do you, Martin?
No.

It's great getting to know someone this, you know, vigorously.
So your parents?
Oh.

My mother is an acupuncturist in Toronto, and my father is an, um-- he's an environmental activist in Albuquerque.
He's an environmental activist in Albuquerque, dad.
Deal with it.
I didn't say anything.
I'm sure it's very satisfying work.
He never met a tree that he didn't want to chain himself to.
Sweetie, you have a little, um, salad dressing.
Oh.
Oops.

I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
Could tonight's dinner have gone any worse?
Actually, it could have.
Mm, I guess he could have castrated me at the table.
Last time i introduced dad to a boyfriend,
I never heard from the guy again, so...
Wow.

Martin, i know he's tough.
But you're not gonna have to deal with him.
I probably won't see him for another year, so...
Oh.
In that case, I think we should make a plan to see him sooner than that.
You'd be up for that?
Absolutely.
I would go through that hell all over again for you.
Coming.
I'm coming.
Mr. gallo?
Ginnie home?
Home?

I mean, uh, she may be home, but, uh...
Ginnie doesn't live here anymore.
We broke up.
Okay.
Want to invite me in?
Oh.

Yeah.

Sorry.
I was just, uh, getting some work done.
She didn't tell you when we, uh, broke up?
We haven't spoken since Christmas.
Ah.

She's not picking up or returning calls or texts.
I was hoping maybe she'd be here.
Oh, I just, uh--
I just had a little, uh, get-together last month, so-- don't worry about it.
Just cleaning, anyway.
Yeah.

Did you try Gary and Roberta?
Gary and Roberta?
Yeah.

Do you want any coffee?
Uh, that's-- that's okay.

I'm just gonna make some anyway.
So, uh...
So when did you two break up?
Uh, about three months ago.
Three months and nine days or something.
I don't-- you know, I'm not, uh--
I'm sure she's, uh-- you said she, uh-- she knew you were coming in to town?
I gave her the heads-up i was coming in last minute, but I never got a response.
Huh.
No, no.

Gallo:

Jimothy.
Like Timothy with a "j."
No.
Jimothy, this is Mr. gallo, ginnie's dad.
Who?
Ex-girlfriend's father.
Do you have the bong?
What?

What do you mean by that?
The bong, thing I smoke weed out of all day.
Oh, is that-- is that-- is that what this is?
I was-- yeah, i was looking earlier.
I just didn't-- i was curious.
You're giving me a real stressy vibe, man.
Uh...

What's going on?

Could you just, um-- just take your weird machine there and just let Mr. gallo and I talk?
Am I wrong?

You're not wrong.
Yeah.
I'm having people over tonight, in case you want to hide in your room again.
You can come.
I thought-- you know, i thought we said, uh-- we agreed, you know, last time, you know, with-- with the cops...
Oh, so I'm not allowed to have people over in my own home?
No, it's cool.

Oh, did you get my message?
What message?
The fiddle player in your band or something came by, wanted you to know you had a show this weekend or something.
Wait.

I think so.
Well, did he say when or where?
Didn't say when.
Didn't say where.
You know, I'm not-- heh.

None of my business.

Okay.
When ginnie moved out, i needed a new roommate to help cover the rent.
Of course, yeah.

Yeah.

Oh, I'll go get that coffee.
Look, Martin, i can see you're, uh, a busy man here.
Tomorrow I have to get on a flight to Geneva.
All I want to do is find my daughter, so if you can just point me to her new place,
I'll get out of your hair.
Uh, we're all out of milk.
And sugar.

You want syrup in your coffee, or is that-- is that weird?
I don't want syrup.

Okay.
So do you have an address for this Gary and Roberta?
Uh, no, but they're not too far from here.
Uh, I don't have an address, but I've been over there.
So it's close?

Yes, it's just a couple blocks that-a-way.
Okay.

Now?
Yes, now, Martin.

Fuck.
Fuck this.
Hey, Martin, do you mind if I go on this computer for a minute, check e-mails?
Um, yeah, sure.

Fuck.

H-hold on!

Holy shit!
Uh, you know, I just--
I tell jimothy not to use my computer, but he does.
Look, Martin, porn is porn, you know, but you gotta hide that shit.
Put it in a folder or something.

Can't just leave it hanging out there.
You know, i-- i can't even believe that they have sites like that on the Internet.

Okay, you want to put on some pants so we can hit the road?
Here.

Ahh.
Wasn't ready for that.
Actually, I don't drive.
What do you mean, you don't drive?
Ah, I don't have my license.
And, uh, also i don't know how.
Nice throw.
How can you not know how to drive in Los Angeles?
A man should know how to drive.
I have a bicycle.
Oh, well, congrats on that.
Yeah, it's actually considered very masculine in the Netherlands.
You know, hey, i haven't really been in touch with ginnie recently, so...

So I might not come in.

You know, not that we're not friends.
You know, we're still friends.

We're still friends on Facebook.

Martin, where are we going?
Oh, uh, it's just up ahead that-a-way and a second left at the light.
It's one of these.
I can never tell which.
They all look the same.
Voice mail's still full.
It's gotta be this one.
I hear fighting.
This is definitely it.
Okay, well, write it down, like, on the dry erase!
'Cause Saturday's my day!
Shit.

Um-- Gary.
Yeah, hey, Martin.

Sorry to just drop by like this.
Yeah, it-- it really is-- we're looking for my daughter.
Ginnie.

This is her father, Mr. gallo.
Uh, he didn't have her new address.
She, um--
Martin, hi.
Oh.
Uh, they-- they're looking for ginnie, babe.
Um, this is ginnie's dad.
I'm Roberta.

Jack, right?
That would be ginnie's stepfather.
Right.

She's talked a lot about you, too.
Did you invite them in?
I literally just opened the door.
Come in.

Yeah, come on in.

After you.

Micasa-- heh heh.
Roberta:

Water or kombucha?
Twig tea?
I have some nice biodynamic wine.
Don't bother.

Martin said she was staying here.
She was staying here.
Uh, she left about three weeks ago.
Did you try her cell?
Phone is off, mailbox full for a couple days now.
Gary:

Martin, was ginnie, like, a survivalist, you know?
Like one of those preppers or-- Gary, stop talking.
Do you know where she moved when she left here?
Yes.

Ohh.

What was her name?
Martin, you know her.
Um, the jittery girl.
Always looks like she's about to cry.

Mm, doesn't, uh, ring a bell.
Okay, did ginnie leave an address?
Roberta:

I think it's on the fridge.
Uh, Gary, could you get it, please?
Please come in.
Gary:

It's on the fridge!

It's definitely on the fridge.
I just checked there.
Jesus.

There's no address on the fridge.
It's on the Japanese paper.
Yeah, no.

Roberta:

Fine.

It's not there.
You sure you guys don't want anything, like a-- like a beer?
Sure.

Ah, you know, uh,
I'm fine.

Uh, how have you been, Gary?
I've been, um-- work's good.

Gary, where's the tub where we, uh, keep the receipts?
What tub?

Excuse me.

What tub are you ta-- the tin?
That's a tin.

Tub, tin, whatever.

Can I help you find what you're looking for?
Go-- go check the drawer.
What drawer?
The odds-and-ends drawer.
All right, I'm just saying be specific.
We'll find it.
Can I get you guys something?
Are you sure?

We have nice cheese.
Oh, we're out of the cheese, babe.
Since when?
Since we finished it.
I didn't finish the cheese, so don't say "we."
I was gonna freeze it for my doula workshop next month.
It's okay.

Someone finished the cheese, I guess.
Yeah, someone was hungry in their house, and they ate cheese.
They ate it all, though.
It's okay.
Have you seen ginnie recently?
Brother.
I certainly have not.
We love ginnie.
Don't get me wrong.
But some of us loved her a little too much, if you know what I mean, and some things got said.
Yeah, some things got said.

Yeah, I said 'em, all right.

'Cause someone had to say something, 'cause a certain someone in this house wanted to have sex with his daughter.
Okay, what?

No?

And unfortunately, in this house, that makes certain people very insecure.
Okay, let me translate for Mr. sensitivity over here.
Ginnie was getting a little sick and tired of being leered at every time she went to the fridge.
It was one time, and i was trying to warn her about the bad milk!
Mr. gallo, Martin, ginnie was going for some bad milk in the fridge, so I was peering to see what she was grabbing from the fridge, in order to say, "hey, don't ingest that, yeah.
'Cause you might get sick." I was doing a service.
You're a knight in shining armor, aren't you, gare?
Here's an idea.

Ohh!

They're strippers!

You can't stop them!

They're-- they're like monkeys at a zoo!
Can't stop 'em.
The monkeys climb all over you at a zoo?
Really?

Okay, we should probably get going.
If you find that address, you could give me a shout, that'd be great.
We'll find it.
Don't worry.

I'm so sorry about the cheese.
You know, it was very expensive cheese.
Jesus, Roberta, he doesn't care about the goddamn cheese.
You, uh, might want to try the cafe.
Martin knows where it is.
She's probably working there.
The cafe?

Great.

Yeah.

Uh, all right.

Thank you for...
That.

Why do you have to attack me?
Why are you-- have to be so hostile?
And now i completely lost face.
I gotta go apologize for something i didn't even do.
Hey, ma-Martin.
Are we cool, man?
Are we-

Bro, I would never...
Gary, it's fine.
I mean, you know, we're not even--
I know.

I wouldn't-- and, Mr. gallo,
I would never-- okay.

I'll rest easy now.
You guys are the best.

She's probably there, all right?
Hey, and tell her Gary says, "what's up?"
Okay, so you just wanna go straight until sunset, and then you make a right, and, uh, you can't miss it.
Um, before you drop me off,
I can draw you a little map.
What, are you dora the explorer?
Fuck that.

Yeah.
I would love to.
Just apparently I have a show coming up, and I really need to rehearse.
I'll pay you, okay?
Pay me?

I beg to differ.
Look, Martin,
I'll be straight with you.
I'm worried here, okay?
This is not like my daughter to just disappear like this.
If you care about her at all,
I would think you would want to know if she's okay or not.
I do.

Of course I do.
Okay.
Tell me when to turn.
This is where my daughter works?
Yeah.

They got a little gallery now.
It was ginnie's idea, actually.
Really turned the place around.
Nothing.

You know this one?
Yeah.

You're the slut.
The old one, maybe.
You're gross.
I have to go.
Call me if it doesn't stop bleeding.
Tracy, hi.
Uh, it's Martin.
Remember me?
No.
Uh, ginnie's boyfriend.
Ex-boyfriend.
Is ginnie working today?
Ginnie doesn't work here anymore.
What?

Since none of your business.
I'm her father...
Trying to find her.
Oh.

Do you know where she's working now?
I think she works at some restaurant.
Lizzie, our manager, would know, but she's at moglu right now.
Moglu?

Did you check her Facebook?
Checked her Facebook.

Twitter.

You tweet something, will you?
Oh, I don't-- i don't Twitter-- or tweet or, you know, twit.
'Course you don't.
Look, um, Tracy, would you mind just putting something out there--
I already did it.

I tweeted it.
Great.

"Baller old guy, creepy young guy looking for ginnie g.

I'm creepy?

I've met her many times, many times.
Yeah.

Is this whole neighborhood stoned?
Uh, maybe she was stoned.
You know, this-- this neighborhood's probably 70% stoned, 80% on a Sunday.
All right, where's the yoga place?
Uh, just that-a-way.
So, uh, where'd you say you were coming from?
Mumbai.
Oh, Mumbai!
Yeah.

Uh, no, no.

It's a shithole.
Huh.

Well, I guess I can, uh, cross that off the list then.
I need to take this.
Okay.
Barry.

Yeah, yeah.

Hey, Lizzie.
Martin.
What are you doing here?
Uh...

No.

I was just wondering-- I've been looking for ginnie.
Martin, Martin, Martin...
Martin, you've got to get over this ginnie thing.
She's moving on.

Uh, what do you mean, she's moving on?

Okay, everything is in place.
Barry, look, my phone is about to die.
Okay, Barry, stop talking.
I don't think this is the best move for you, Martin, but if you need some kind of closure or whatever, she's hostessing at bibola.
Bibola?

It's a restaurant, Martin.
It's the new, hot big restaurant in west Hollywood.
Fuck!

Okay.

Yeah, Martin, you should know that-- oh, and by the way, good job.

What the hell does that mean, "good job"?
No, I didn't mean it like-- like-- what did you mean?

You know, like "good job, yoga."
Uh-huh.

Fuck off, Martin.

Absolutely.

Good-bye.
You're an asshole.
Stop talking, Barry.
Just do your fucking job, okay?
She said ginnie's working at a restaurant in west Hollywood.
Let's go.
Frank.
Wow.

Hi.

It's been a minute.
Are you in town for a visit?
Yeah, just popped in.

I'm a sweaty mess, but thank you.
You look good.
How long are you in town for?
Very briefly.
Uh, I'm sorry.

Oh.

Well, it was, uh-- it was good to see you.
You, too.
So if you end up sticking around, give me a shout.

Take care, Kelly.

You're gonna catch flies there, Kermit.

Was that that waitress from that night we all had dinner?
I don't know, maybe.

No, i-- nothing.

Where we going?

That's gotta be the 15th fucking time you said "that-a-way."
Are you hopalong Cassidy?
Who's hopalong Cassidy?
Ha-- get in the car.
I thought there was a little something going on that night.
Forget about it.
No, I know.

She's very attractive.
Yes.

Okay?

Very attractive.
So how did that work?
Did she slip you her number-- would you fucking forget about it?

Jesus.

nice.
Sweet.
You like Bob seger?
Yeah.

"Beautiful loser," "stranger in town,"
those are some of my favorite albums ever.
might be hope for you yet.
Maitre d' says she quit about 10 days ago all of a sudden, has no idea why.
She only worked here two weeks.
That is pretty weird.
Yeah, it is.
Well, want to grab a bite?
Here?
Sure.

Gotta refuel, right?
I mean, you must be starving.

That's very nice of you.
I guess i am pretty hungry.
Good.
Oh, yeah, ginnie.
Yeah, I love ginnie.

I was bummed when she quit.
But I think maybe she got a better job.
You know where?

But I can ask around.
In the meantime, can i get you anything to start?
I think we'll skip straight to the entree.
We're in a bit of a rush.
I'll take the, uh, steak-frites, rare.
I guess I'll have, uh-- you know what?

Excellent.

Uh, yeah, yeah, rare.
Very good.
This place is pretty, uh, chichi.
Yeah, for you, I guess, eating tofu out of a paper bag or whatever.
That is how i usually eat, actually.
She'll turn up, Mr. gallo.
She will.
Have you, um...
Talked to ginnie's mom?

I was just thinking, uh, maybe she's heard from her.
I don't want to worry her.
Right, but, you know, they're pretty close.
I mean, maybe she knows where she is.
And what if she doesn't?
Then she's in a panic.
And whose fault is that?
Yours?
Well, no, it would be yours, actually, because it's your idea.
Maybe she lost her phone.

Martin, I get that you think I'm being paranoid here, okay?
But believe me, shit happens every day.
Friend of mine's daughter takes a little trip to Europe.
She gets grabbed 20 minutes out of orly.
Jesus.

Lucky for them i know a thing or two about a thing or two.

A thing or two?

Wait.

What?

His-- his daughter gets kidnapped or his wife.
This is not a movie, Martin.

What-- what is so funny?
Oh, just, uh-- it just reminds me of-- ginnie could never explain what you do.
It always seemed so mysterious to us.
We used to joke that you were a, uh, um, an arms dealer or something, you know, something badass.
Well, something like that, but not quite so glamorous, I guess.
So what is it that you do, exactly, then?
I'm in procurement.
Okay.
Huh.
Procurement.
So what about you?

Well, I guess I've got that show coming up with my band, but I'm not sure that I want to do it.
Not sure?
Well, what's the issue?
Well, it's been a while, and I guess I've been trying to figure some stuff out actually.

Finally hit me.
What's the endgame?
I mean, I'm probably never gonna make...
A real living at it, or at least one decent enough to support a family or...
Are you good at it?
Yeah, I am.
Then you should play the show.
Waiter:

No luck on the ginnie front, I'm sorry to say.
Well, thanks for trying.
You know, it is Thursday, though.
You know, you might want to try rococo.
You know her friend trev?

He's been djing there every Thursday.
Yeah, I know Trevor.
You know the place?
Enjoy your meal.
Dig in.
You okay there, bub?
It's been a while since I ate meat.
Yeah.

Oh, three...
Maybe five years.
Nobody made you order it.
Tell you what, let's go to that rococo place, get a drink, settle your stomach, huh?
I guess one drink couldn't hurt.
If not, maybe you can point out somebody that knows her, huh?
You're the boss.

This place is impossible.
We're never getting in.
What, are you kidding me?

Where are you...
All right.
He's with me.
Have a good night.
How'd you do that?
I spoke the guy's language.
What-- what was it, samoan?
What, you spoke samoan?
Dennis said he hadn't seen her, but you never know.
Dennis?

Martin, look around.
See if you can spot anyone who knows ginnie.
No, I don't know, Mr. gallo.
This really doesn't look like her kind of crowd.
Come on.

Two taliskers, neat.
You got it.
See anything?
No.
There you go.
I think I, uh...
Good.
Hey, Megan.
Oh, my god.

Megan!
What the fuck are you doing here?
I'm looking for ginnie, actually.
Oh, Martin, you gotta get over it.
It's so sad, like-- no, I'm-

Uh, it's just her dad is looking for her, actually.
Do you-- do you know if she's gonna be here tonight?
What?

Who?

Get over it, Martin!
'Kay.
Oh, wow.
She's very drunk.
Yeah.

Right?

Yeah.

Yes!

Oh, sorry?
I just, uh-- have you seen ginnie by any chance?
I'm sorry.

Ginnie, my ex-girlfriend.
Yeah.

Sorry.

I know.

I feel like I'm screaming at you.
It probably looks like we're having a horrible, horrible argument.
Fuck you, you fucking asshole!
I swear to fucking god!
Woman:

I'm sorry.
Oh.

It was a joke about arguments.
Oh, man.

I probably went too far.
No.

I don't think I've seen her in here for a few weeks.
Is she missing or something?
Something like that.
This one's on the house all right?
Thank you.

She's seeing somebody?
Yeah, cute guy, too, a big tipper.
They met here, I think.
You seen him lately?
No.

Just a second.
So do you come here often?
No, never.
It's a little bit too, like-- axe body spray?
Yes.

Yeah.

I don't know if that's gonna happen.
Yeah, I saw you play, like-- like a year ago at the river room.
You were really good, kind of like...
The punch brothers meets, like, the foggy mountain boys meets, like, the muppets.
Yeah, thanks, I think.
That's at least partially what-- exactly what-- man:

Hey, Trevor.
They let you in here?
Yeah.

Oh man.
I know this guy!
He's an idiot!
Hey, um, I think my friend is leaving, so I have to go.
Okay.

Yeah.

Bye-bye.

Listen, Trevor, have you seen ginnie recently?
Uh, yeah, I'm just gonna do you a solid and not even answer that, bro.
I don't know what your problem is with me.
Hey, I told you guys about Marty here, right?
He plays old-timey music on his banjo like he's old McDonald or some shit, and, like, 10 people show up.
It's hilarious.
Yeah, well, you know, what's hilarious is, uh, you know, you look like a-- a rapist...
Like you've committed rape.
You know why ginnie dumped you?
'Cause she's way too fine for your hella broke ass.
I kind of want to punch you in the face right now.
You know, Marty, a woman like ginnie, deserves to be given the finer things in life.
And there's a long line of dudes who want to give it to her.
Hey, Martin.
Everything okay?

I was just talking to ginnie's, uh, friend Trevor, just asking him if he's seen ginnie.
And?
And I was telling Marty here that the way that girl's been working through their breakup, she could be facedown in any bed in a 10-mile rad--
Look out!
time to go.
Holy shit.

I shouldn't have done that.
Oh, fuck that guy.
Never been in a bar fight before.
That was-- that was so amazing when I was like, "look out!"
You're a real lifesaver.

I feel like i could have totally held my own, though.
I've got a ton of pent-up rage
I've never gotten to use.

Gallo:

Oh, shit.

E'eryone is right now--
Megan?

Megan, are-- are you okay?
Why is bri-baby being such a dick-face right now?
Um, i-

Bri-baby.

And if he doesn't like it, he can kiss my ass.
Well, uh...
Is this my car?
Well, oh, oh, no.

I don't think it's such a good idea for you to be driving right now, Megan.
Well, maybe it's not such a good idea for your face to be a dick right now.
Right.

Uh...
Mr. gallo...
Yeah.
Where do you live, Megan?
You know where.
Burger king.
Because we're trying to drive you home.
Oh, I don't want to go home.
I want to go to the par-tay.
Are you still on sweetzer?
I want to go to the party so I can blow Dan Franklin.
Let's get her home, for Dan Franklin's sake.
Yeah, I think she's still on sweetzer.
It's just a right at the next light.
Yeah?
Okay, slow down, Barry.
What the hell do you mean they're backing out?

Barry.

Barry.
Fuck.
Fucking phone died.
Perfect.
Take a picture, and post it on bri-baby's Twitter fuck.
you gonna make it upstairs okay?
Where is it?
Where it's at?
We'll-- we'll help you up.
Got it.
Why don't you get rid of Martin so me and you can go to the party and party?
I think you're kind of partied out, kiddo.
Ah, I'm fine.

I'm fuckin' fine.
I just need to spit.
Megan:

Okay.

There you go.
Where am I?
Move just a little bit.
Okay.
Drink this.

Megan...

Drink this.

Mm.

It'll make you feel better, Megan.
Uh-uh.

We can make out if you want.
That's a nice offer, but I'm good.
Mm, 'cause you're so in love with ginnie still.
Well, sure, that, and I think you still have some vomit in your hair.
That's fucked up, dude.
'Cause you know she's in love with someone else.
She is?
Mm-hmm.
Who's that?
Mr. hot stuff.
Mm.
Mr. hot stuff?
Dude's ripped.
That's...
Awesome.
This Mr. hot stuff...
Does he have a name?
Megan?
Megan, what's his name?
M-Megan.
Megan.

This girl is friends with my daughter?
Yeah.
This isn't ginnie, Mr. gallo.
She's not like this.
Let me find you a shirt.
What the fuck is going on here?
Hey, uh, no.
Now, um...
What the fuck is going on here?
Hey, relax, okay?

That's my fucking girlfriend, dude!
Oh, you're, um, bri-baby.
I-I'm Martin.
I'm Martin.
I'm ginnie's ex-boyfriend,
Megan's friend ginnie.
Why is this dude fucking shirtless?
Just relax, bri-baby.
Your girlfriend threw up on me is all.
Tell you what.

hey, Martin--
Fuck.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Martin:

I think he's-- he's...
Oh, he's breathing.
He's breathing.
Good for him.
Let's get out of here.
That-a-way.
That doesn't look too bad.
Fucking hurts.
How 'bout the smell?
I still smell like vomit?
Little bit.
Oh.
What?

You really had my back up there.
Yeah, well, Mr. gallo-- you can call me frank.
I don't think i can do that, Mr. gallo, but you're welcome.
Megan said ginnie had a new boyfriend.
Yeah.

Bartender at the club said the same thing.
Well, so...
We probably won't be finding her tonight, and that's because she's with him.
Look, Martin-- so even if we do find her, find them, how's it gonna look?
I'm tooling around with her dad.
She's shacked up with her new boyfriend.
So she's dating someone else.

I mean, don't you still want to know that she's okay?
Aren't you at all worried that none of the people we talked to tonight know where she is?
Of course I'm worried about her.
Because I thought you still cared about her.
Of course I still care about her!
She broke my heart!
Has that not been spelled out enough for you tonight?
Your daughter fucked my shit up.
My life has been a complete wreck for the last three months.
I mean, I can't eat.

All I've literally been able to do...
Is sleep.
So what do you want to do, go home?
Yes.
Crawl into bed, sleep some more?
Yes, that's exactly what I wanna do.
Martin, I get it.

It's a fucking terrible feeling.
It sucks, but...
I don't think retreating into your shell is doing you a lot of good.
Listen, I'm telling you this from personal experience, okay?
Life goes by really fast.
If you half-ass it now, you're gonna feel it later.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.

There you go, juicy.
Since we're, um, exploring our options-- and I know this is a sensitive area, but maybe you could try calling ginnie's mom.
I'm not calling ginnie's mother, period.
End of story.

So why'd you and ginnie break up?
You know that prizewinning douchebag
Trevor back at the club, he was saying that ginnie is out of my league.
She's an amazing girl, as you obviously know.
She's smart, beautiful, funny, and tough.
Yeah, and, um...
She is out of my league.
Well...
Maybe she saw something you don't.
Maybe she did, but I started to get insecure about it, and then I got jealous and moody.
I don't know.
It was my fault.
I just--
I fucked it up.
I fucked it all up.
We all fuck it up sometimes.
There it is.
So procurement, what is that?
Forget about it.
No, no.

I bid on contracts from foreign governments to procure for them anything they need in bulk, grain, seed, fertilizer, fucking nuts and bolts, what have you.
Ah.
Okay.
Procurement.
Actually, figuring how to get 20 tons of corn feed from Germany to Nigeria can be more exciting than it might sound like.
But it's also...
Just not a normal lifestyle, you know?
Makes it harder to see my daughter, for example.
hey, you know that other girl at the club?
What girl?
What do you mean, "what girl?"
The one I saw you talking to.

What, Lois?
Wait.

Jesus, Martin, wake up.
90% of that shit is body language, okay?
She's into you.
Wow, really?
Huh, Lois.
I just...
You gotta be kidding me.
Gary?
Hey!
Hey, how's it going, guys?
Hey, did you find ginnie?
Was she at the cafe?
No.

You don't think she got kidnapped, do you?
No!

Hey, does Roberta know you're here?
Yeah.

She sent me out for groceries.
Um, I had to replace the cheese.
Yeah, so how's that going, the grocery shopping?
I don't know.

Air.
Yeah, 'cause actually, uh...
I don't know if you guys noticed, but Roberta and i have actually been having a lot of problems lately.
No shit?

No idea.

Sorry to hear that, gare.
Thanks.
Uh, how 'bout if i buy you another one?
Yeah!

Definitely!
Yeah, one more for our friend.
One more.

I got it.

Bartender:

Always tastes better when it's free.

It does, though, a little bit.
Yeah, no, i remember those days.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Okay, back to business.
What do we know about this guy, Mr. hot stuff?
Mr. who?
Ginnie's got a new boyfriend.
Really?

For you, man.

That sucks for you.
We know he's a regular at the club.
Bartender says he's a big tipper.
And he's ripped, apparently.
So he goes to the gym, frequents nightclubs, likes to throw his money around, maybe act like a big shot.
Sounds like an asshole.
This is what I'm saying.

Hmm.

Did you smell a rat when you met him?
No, no rat.
Field mouse, maybe.
Field mouse.
Hah hah.
He's right.
You're a field mouse, bro.
This is great.
This is what I'm talking about.
This is just guys being guys, drinking beer, and busting balls.
"Field mouse."
Mm.

Next round is on me.

You've been more than generous, Mr. gallo.
Got an emergency 20 in here somewhere.
No way.
Ohh.
I been looking for this, my 'shrooms.
You guys want some?

Hey, we should do these together, go camping.

You should probably put those away, like, now.
Wait.
Japanese paper.
Gary:

Gary, you dumbass, drug-addled son of a bitch,
I could kiss you right now.
Okay, but we should wait 'til after we eat the 'shrooms.
Are you kidding me?
Are you just completely out to lunch?
Martin, who cares?
We have ginnie's address.

No, no, no, no.

Martin, man, i-I'm really sorry.
I am, but you just--
Martin, come on.
Let it go.
Field mouse, huh?
Hey, guys, wait.
Can I come?
Gary:

This is great, really.
Really great, man.
Call to adventure, you know?
We're on the case.
Oh, you know what it's-- it's, um-- it's like that movie, that movie...
John Wayne--
Whoa!
Whuhh!
Mr. gallo, you sure you're okay to drive?
Sound like my ex.

"The searchers." That's it.
Ah, man, that's an awesome movie.
Hey, do either of you have any weed on you?
I don't like to 'shroom without a little weed.
You know, I bet i can get my dealer to come meet us.
What's the, um-- Gary...
We're not gonna have your weed dealer meet us at my daughter's place.
Right.

Oh, shit.
Sycamore, right?
What's the address?
1030 sycamore.
Terri sadler.
That's her roommate, right?
Yeah, that's her.

No, but keep asking.
Ohh!
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
I can't get unbuckled.
Gary, just stay with the car.
Mm-hmm.
Windows are dark.
Yeah, well, some people are actually asleep after midnight.
Okay.

Where?
Um, that's not really, um-- that's kind of private.
Martin, I'm not gonna rob you.
What am I gonna take, your bong?
Where did you hide the key?
It was under a rock, but...
What-- what are you gonna-- no, you're not gonna-- it's okay.
I'm her father.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mr. gallo, you are not--
Martin, I need to see if my daughter is in trouble.
Okay, this is a very bad idea.
You know what, Martin?

Oh, are you?

'Cause you're a namby-pamby, little fucking pain in the ass.
Now move it.
No.
Seriously?
Martin, you do not want to be standing in my fucking way right now.
Fine.
That's what I thought.
Fuck this.
Shit.
Gary:

Because all you wanna do is sit around watching "game of thrones"
and fantasize about Jaime lannister!
You do!

I don't get mad at you, because I get it!
Even with one hand, he's beautiful!
Hello.
Anybody home?
Shit.
Woman:

Mr. gallo.
I think ginnie's room's over here.
Thank fucking god.
What the fuck?
Wait.

I found out where ginnie is.
Where?

His name is kip.
Kip.

I think it sounds pretty serious.
Gary:

'Member those 'shrooms you wouldn't let me take on Halloween?
Well, trick or treat, 'cause I'm taking 'em right now.
Mmm.

I can eat 'shrooms.

I can eat fucking cheese, because I'm my own man.
I have something inside of me.
I have potential.
I-- hello.

wait a minute.

Terri:

Hello?
Shh.

Hi...
There.

No, no, no.

What is this girl's name?
Um, Tammy, Toni, uh...
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Frank:

Run!
I will fucking murder you!
You don't know her?

I don't fucking know her.
Terri:

Do you hear that, you motherfucker?

I have a gun!
You motherfucker, i will...
What do we do?
No way.
No way.

...fucking calling the motherfucking cops on you!
I am not getting arrested tonight.
Wait.

So beautiful.
I know how you found out ginnie's on vacation.
You called her mom.

I did.

You had no right to do that.

Are you serious?

We should have called 12 hours ago.
Like, then, maybe you wouldn't have home invaded.
It's complicated, okay?
I didn't do right by ginnie's mom.

Fucked around when ginnie was little.
Yeah, it's old news.

You got a lot of nerve talking to me like that.
Ginnie's mom is fine, Mr. gallo.
She's happily remarried.

Ginnie did, too.
Freeze!

I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm gonna let it shine.
I'm shining my light!
This is the police.

Just to be clear, I've always been there for my daughter.
I gave her everything she wanted.
How 'bout your attention?
Oh, sh...

Hi.
We, uh-- could we use your bathroom?
Toilet is for customers only.
Uh, here.
Come on.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sorry.

Here you go.

Let's go.
Both of you, on the ground now!
This day is never-ending.

I'm sure it's nothing, babe.
It's fine.
No, kip, they're directly in front of my house.
Okay, look, officers, it's-- it's just really a big misunderstanding.
Stop right there, and get down!
Just calm down for a second.
I can explain the whole thing.
That was my daughter's apartment.
On the ground!
Mr. gallo, get down now.
I will not.

I am a taxpayer.
I am a-- dad?
Ginnie?

Gary, stop.
Tastes like glass.
All I wanted was to make it through this breakup in one piece, not be desperate or stalkery or pathetic.
I just needed to wait it out, get to the other side with my pride intact.
instead, I became my ex-girlfriend's father's idiot lackey, everyone she knows in this town getting an eyeful of what a loser I am.
Ah, Martin, you're not a loser.
Oh, not to mention-- not to mention the throwing up, the bar brawl, breaking and entering my ex-girlfriend's new home, running from the police--
I really don't need a recap, okay?
I was there.
Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, just shut the fuck up, okay?

Just shut the fuck up!
Couple of weeks ago in my hotel in Mumbai,
I woke up in the middle of the night soaked in sweat, didn't know where I was.
I didn't know who I was for a second.
My heart was just going...
Thousand miles a minute.
I mean, i-

I called down to the front desk and-- and asked 'em to send up a doctor.
And then I'm-- I'm just lying there, thinking, "this is it,"
you know, "this is-- this is it."
And so I called ginnie...
And ginnie wasn't there.
And of course the doctor shows up, and he-- and he checks everything out.
He says it's not a heart attack.
It's not-- it's nothing.
It's a fucking panic attack.
Just ridiculous...
Embarrassing.
I'm at the airport the next morning, and, uh...
No, it's not like there's a layover here.
I'm supposed to be in Geneva right now.
But I came here, because...
Because I needed to see my little girl.
I have no one else, Martin.
You know?
She's all I got.
Hey, you guys, you guys, you guys, you guys...
Can we just be serious for one moment?
Okay, can we just...
Talk real shit?
Visitor for Gary...
"Fulenwilder"?
Huh?

Roberta.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my poor, poor baby.

What a night you've had.
Baby, I see your light.
It's, like, blue.
Your aura is blue, like an "avatar" thing.

You know,
I actually believed you, that you were going to the store to replace the cheese because you felt bad about it.
No, no, no.
Not my gare.
My gare's not that kind of boyfriend, is he?
Ow.

Because I'm tripping my balls off kind of guy.
Ow.

Good.

You're gonna stay here until your arraignment...
Uh-huh.

I want-- i want to come home.

I know you do, honey, but that's because you're scared and stupid right now, so you just sit tight, and sleep on it, okay?
Uh-huh.

Nice work, guys.
Gary:

All right, you two.
Looks like your lawyer has saved your ass.
Ginnie.
What the hell, dad?
I know.

You hadn't returned voice mails or e-mails.
I was on vacation, and I tried to call you back as soon as I got off the plane.
Right.

So you thought it would be a good idea to break into my house with my ex-boyfriend?
Look, I'm sorry, okay, but what are you doing running off without telling anybody and not answering your phone?
We were in bora bora trying to unplug, and I told mom.

Dad, this is kip.
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
How do you do?
I-I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.
It's my fault.
That's very generous of you, but I'm pretty sure it's all my fault.
Hey.

Uh, I'm Martin.
Well, uh, since we have your father's rental car, you want to-- want to take him back to the hotel?

I'll meet you there?

Okay.

It was nice to meet everybody.
I guess I'll-- I'm gonna be going, too.
Um, ginnie, I'm so sorry about everything.
It was really nice to see you, though.
Martin.
Martin!
Look, ginnie,
I'm truly-- no, no, no.
You don't have to apologize.
I know how persuasive my dad can be.
Well, yeah, but go easy on the guy, huh?
I think he's been in a pretty rough place lately.
I'll try.
How are you?
You know, uh...
How have you been?
I actually applied to ucla, architecture and urban design, and I got in.

That's great.
That's what you've always wanted.
That's-- that's great.
I found out last week, and bora bora was kip's congratulation gift.
I'm sorry that you had to find out about him like this.
I didn't know if I should call.
Ah, no.

And you, you seem...
You seem really happy.
And I'm happy for you.
Your head hurt?
Little bit.
Good.
Look, ginnie--
I don't want to hear it, dad.
Hey, you didn't tell me you were thinking about going back to school.
You're not in my life.
Okay?

When are you gonna understand that you don't get a say in what I do or where I go or who with?
Look...
You're my dad, and I love you...
And I do know that you love me.
Why do you have to be such an asshole?
I don't know.
Why is the sky blue?
Jimothy:

Ah, no, no, no, no.
Jimothy...
I'm trying to beat this level, dawg.
Have some respect.
We need to talk.
Well, I'm busy.
And after i beat this level,
I'm gonna do more drugs, have more sex with this very attractive couple, and then sleep for 16 hours, so pencil you in after that.
Hey, it's time for you to move now.
Get your shit, and go.

You're done.
This is mine.
You know, I find your newfound confidence intoxicating.
What if we...
Figured out a different way to pay rent...
A physical way?
Connie:

Hey, Connie.
I hope it's okay i called.
Frank?
Mr. gallo.
Jesus.

Thanks for coming, frank.
That's nice stuff up there.
Seriously, really, really good.

Ah, thanks.
I thought you were, uh-- had to be in Geneva.
I figured I'd stick around here, spend a little time with my daughter.
You want a beer?
Sure.
You know, Martin, you went to the mat for me in a big way.
I appreciate it.
Well, I mean...
I won't forget it.
Looks like you got a fan there.
Who?
Oh, Lois?
Yeah, I, uh...
Martin, would you please open your eyes?
That girl is clearly here for you.
We met up before the show.
Did you, now?
Yeah.

Look at you.
I am impressed.
Uh...
I should probably go say hi before the second set.
I think you should.

I'm totally good.
Okay.
Um...
Martin...
Get over there.
they sound real good tonight.
Yeah.

His dad?

No, I'm, uh... whoo!
