Previously on Queen of the South...
And just because your father and I are separated doesn't mean we can't have a relationship.
I don't want anything to do with that world.
You do need a new supplier.
You need to go to Bolivia.
You and your people got 72 hours, or me and my boats are Cambodia bound.
We got 100 grand.
Take it, you never see us again.
If we don't make this deal with El Santo,
Guero's going to die.
I'll make an appointment.
It's El Santo's bible.
Yeah, he's not just a drug dealer.
He runs some sort of whackedout cult.
Give me El Santo.
Two days.
Hey, hey, hey!
No, no, it's blocked that way!
Teresa!
Where?
Teresa...
Yo, yo.
Olivia, we shouldn't.
This shit is like 3,000 a bottle.
What you think, Bela?
Are we worth it?
You said your dad wasn't home.
He isn't.
Then who's in his bedroom?
Devious maids?
Isabela.
Your dad's just being stupid.
You shouldn't have to see shit like that.
I'm sorry.
I don't want to be here right now.
Where do you want to go?
Dallas.
Okay.
Pedrito?
What is this place?
Who are these people?
They are the believers.
El Santo?
But it is a name that can never be taken.
It must always, always be given.
Why are you here, Teresa?
My soldiers had to pull you from the jaws of my enemy.
La Capitána.
She would have had her fill of you.
We represent Camila Vargas.
Why are we being held as prisoners?
I was not addressing you,
James.
Go on.
We were hoping to start a relationship with you.
The quality of your product is known everywhere.
Well, I doubt that those that you have encountered have any concept of the true nature of quality.
So... what?
You're washing your product with ether.
It's an old technique and a dangerous one.
I know something more dangerous.
Mediocrity.
Where is the evil in the process of cocaine, Guero Dávila?
You have traveled all over the world, you have sold to carpenters and kings.
Where does the serpent slip its fangs with the venom?
Where grown men sell to children.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
When cocaine is treated with the reverence it deserves...
It can make even children smile.
The evil's in the wash.
Why?
Most leave cocaine impure because impurities makes it heavier, which means more profit.
And washing in ether makes it truly pure.
And where did you learn this?
In the streets of Culiacán.
How much do you seek?
100 kilos to start.
No.
I deal in nothing less than metric tons.
It's just too much.
There must be another deal we can make.
Do you know why I do not sell to the Americas?
Because of deals!
Silver passing from mouth to mouth!
Like a parasite!
Well, I...
Will not be infested by your faithless deals.
And yet here we are.
We passed all your tests, or we wouldn't be standing here.
Right?
You know the soldiers took our money.
Are you just curious?
Perhaps.
We'll take the ton.
Teresa.
With great respect, we'll take the ton.
You have a Judas among you.
Okay, I will consider your request.
But first, atonement is required.
See, you have spilled the blood of my people when you were trying to escape.
So a blood sacrifice is demanded.
So I'm going to give you a choice, Teresa.
One of them must be given up to the knife.
You decide, and decide quickly.
One dies or all of you die.
Decide.
Join us at the top, principessa.
It don't hurt, Bela.
It's just like when we used to play tea party at the bottom of the pool, only sexier.
Like you're a shark and everyone else is just legs.
Come on, guapa.
Let's dance.
Jesus.
She wasn't always like that.
She changed a lot after her mom died.
Yeah, same with Pedro.
After Manuel was killed, he's just different, you know?
Do you think we'll end up like that?
We don't have to be like them.
That's what I like about you.
You manage to see through all this.
When we land,
Isabela, do you know where you're going?
Somewhere safe.
Do you want me to come with you?
Like you said, I gotta do this by myself.
Awesome.
He wants one of us to die to get his drugs.
He's insane.
Maybe he's just trying to turn us against each other.
We need a weapon.
If you attack these people, they will slaughter us.
Yeah?
Then what the hell is your plan?
We're in this prison because of you.
Don't you forget that.
No, no, no... .
We're here 'cause Epifanio outsmarted you, and now you're desperate.
Desperate enough to give you to El Santo.
Hey, I will gladly trade my life for hers.
He's not gonna let any of us live.
Stop it.
You're a coward.
You're a rat.
Trading other people's lives for your own.
You're the Judas.
Yeah, who's the one trying to steal another man's woman?
You f... ing child.
This is business.
But I guess if you were a real man, she wouldn't have to beg to keep you alive.
Me.
Hey, Teresa!
Isabela.
Is everything all right?
What are you...
I thought maybe we could talk?
Yes.
Come on.
Your bible says your heart is a house of sanctuary, even for your enemies.
So I kneel in your house...
And I claim sanctuary.
You... think you can come into my chapel and kneel before my god and use his words against me?
Atonement cannot be derailed like a child's train set.
I've never seen a loving family crave blood before.
Dear child, family has always been about blood.
Mi'ja.
You have already given your heart.
Haven't you?
Teresa?
Teresa?
Are you aware of the word "Moyocoyotzin"?
It means "she who creates herself."
I suspect that...
You might just be pure of heart.
And when he had given thanks, he broke it...
And he said,
"Take this.
"Eat it.
It is my body."
And he quoth, "Of now done darkness",
"I, wretch, lay wrestling with my god."
Will you wrestle with your god, Teresa?
Despiértate, Teresa.
We gotta let Camila know we got the product from El Santo... a metric ton.
There's still no signal.
We need to get ahold of King George.
He could have already gone by now.
How long till Chile?
To George's border crossing, it's about... it's about 4 1/2 hours.
El Camino de la Muerte.
The most dangerous road in Bolivia.
Shit.
We need to take their soldiers out.
Pull up to the roadblock.
Pull up, I mean it.
Just stay here.
Hola.
Sí.
Bring the Mexicana and the two machos to me.
Go, Guero, go!
No, no...
No.
No!
We'll take him back with us.
He said, "Turn around."
Why didn't I let him?
When I was in Afghanistan, some of the guys used to say there's a different god for soldiers, one that judges hearts instead of deeds.
He loved you.
There's still a couple of hours before we get there.
You should try and get some sleep.
Levántate.
Got a metric ton back there.
There's still no signal.
We need to get ahold of King George.
He could have already gone by now.
How long till Chile?
To George's border crossing, it's about... 4 1/2 hours.
El Camino de la Muerte.
The most dangerous road in Bolivia.
Turn around.
We can probably just drive...
Turn the truck around now!
We can't outrun them, not in this thing.
They're La Capitána's men.
They're waiting for us.
We can't let him go!
He's gonna call for reinforcements!
No, no.
Teresa!
There was something in that beetle.
It's done.
Shh.
Teresa, it's me!
It's me.
El Santo.
It's all right.
James.
James!
James.
What did you do?
It was either him or me.
Choose.
You're back.
You had to die to be reborn into my family.
The beetle was poison.
Not for the pure of heart.
Now...
You are one of us.
It is time for you to create yourself,
Teresa Mendoza.
I shall expect the first payment for the metric ton within the week.
Go with God.
My enemy, La Capitána, watches the Death Road.
Be careful, mi'ja.
And there is still a Judas among you.
Every time I order chilaquiles at a restaurant, they always suck.
I love your chilaquiles.
They could use more salt.
I think the last time you made them,
I was ten.
Yeah.
Was the night Nana died.
You were sleeping.
And, you know, the funny thing is, all I could think of was that I wanted to cook her chilaquiles.
You woke me up, and we pigged out.
Life is weird.
A bad thing happened, but... we have a cool memory.
Your hair is so long.
You know, when I was your age,
I used to braid it in a trenza.
I'm so glad you're here.
I miss you so much, you know?
Mommy, please come home.
I can't, Isabela.
Papi is cheating on you.
No, he's not.
What?
He didn't speak to you?
I thought that's why you were here.
Your father and I...
We're getting a divorce.
You don't... you don't have to do that.
I already signed the papers, Isabela.
Nobody told me.
No one tells me anything.
I'm not a child.
Okay.
No, Isabela.
I can't stay here.
Yeah.
We'll be at the border in a few hours.
Have to catch you on the next one.
Look, we got held up.
We're on our way to your cross point now.
See, that ain't my problem, kemosabe.
No, you need to wait for us.
It's Teresa.
Now, don't you try and sweettalk me, baby girl.
Ain't nothing to discuss.
You don't know what we've got.
Darlin', I've been around the world twice and back.
Ain't nothing you can buy for a million bucks gonna shake my cherry tree.
We've got a metric ton of Bolivian flake.
And that's just the start.
Christ, girl.
You got a ton of blow off ol' creepy crawler himself?
He got you on the clock?
A week.
A week?
Every time I turn my back, you're dowsed in gasoline and juggling fire!
You know that shit's a death sentence you don't get back to Dallas, tout suite.
Please, you're the only one who can help me.
God damn it!
Look, you tell Giant Peach, you ain't at the border by sundown,
I'll leave y'all to rot down there, and no amount of prettyfaced guilt is gonna save your ass, you hear me?
Okay.
George, thank you.
Turn around.
Don't give me that look.
You ain't never seen a hero before?
El Camino de la Muerte.
The most dangerous road in Bolivia.
Careful around this bend.
Why?
Andale, cabrónes.
Where are you going?
I gotta take a leak.
We'll find a way to make the shipment work.
This isn't a oneoff.
El Santo expects weekly payments.
And to make those payments, we're gonna have to move three times what we have been.
Your boyfriend screwed us by coming down here.
We didn't have a choice.
We could have thought of something else in those three days.
One that doesn't end up with us dead.
Wouldn't have made a difference.
You had to make a big move.
All your suppliers were burned.
All right, somebody would have tried to move in on your territory.
None of that has anything to do with you.
You put her in the middle of this.
Stop it.
She's out there just swinging in the dark.
I mean, how long you think it's gonna be till it's
Teresa who's not supposed to come back from a mission?
You gonna take her out if Camila tells you to, James?
I want to hear what his answer is.
You have no idea what loyalty is.
Sounds like a yes to me.
This is ridiculous.
We're still alive after all that happened to us, okay?
I'm tired of your bullshit.
That guy has a radio.
Looks like you led us into another ambush.
You're gonna get her killed.
She doesn't know who you really are, but I do.
You don't deserve her.
Do you?
I've been around people like you my whole life.
You saved me.
Why?
You kept her alive when I couldn't.
She kept herself alive.
Hey, I'm not saying I'm not gonna kill you.
I just...
I ain't gonna kill you right now.
But if I'm going to die,
I'm going to pull you out by the root and drag you down into hell with me.
Shh.
Time for you to create yourself,
Teresa Mendoza.
Guero!
James!
You said it was an emergency.
I need you to do something for me.
Of course, anything.
I need you to make me feel good.
Can you do that?
Mamacita?
Gotta grow up someday.
Kique...
Orale, principessa.
Olivia.
Wait... wait, Pedro.
Es todo!
Shit!
