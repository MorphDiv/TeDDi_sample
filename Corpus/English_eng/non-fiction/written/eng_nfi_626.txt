I...
Did not start this war.
I offered you ...
Peace.
I showed you ...
Mercy.
But now you're here.
To finish us off.
For good.
All of human history ... has led to this moment.
The irony is we created you.
And nature has been punishing us ever since.
This is our last stand.
And if we lose,
It will be
A Planet ... of apes.
