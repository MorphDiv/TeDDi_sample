"A little busy" means I don't want to talk about it.

Meet Olivia Prior, member of Dutch Parliament, known for championing education reform and fighting government corruption.
Ooh, I like her already.
Is she in some kind of trouble?
Uh, I'm sorry.
You were saying?
This woman, is she in trouble?
Actually, she may be the one causing the trouble.
According to the CIA, Prior has been leaking state secrets to a terrorist group.
Any idea why she's betraying her own country?
The intelligence services of the Netherlands.
Okay, what say we just call them Dutch Intelligence and move on, 'kay?
The CIA believes that Prior will be meeting with her contact tomorrow, in Amsterdam...
But since sending agents to observe the meet would technically be spying on a close ally...
You are gonna record the meet and get concrete proof...
So no black bag?
(laughing)
What's he so excited about?
Jack loves surveillance ops.
You park the van, you sit back, you relax, and you watch Riley press record.
Well, actually, Jack, it's not as simple as just...
Okay, Riley, I'm sure there's lots of cool computer stuff, too, okay?
Well, that's precisely why I decided that this is the perfect first mission abroad for Bozer.
Hold up.
You just said I'm going on this mission?
You're going on this mission.
I'm going on this mission.
Watch out, Amsterdam!
Here comes Bozer!
Wilt Bozer.
Wiggity, wiggity, uh...
This is literally the easiest first mission abroad that I could give you.
So don't screw it up.

It was everything I thought it would be.
Just like the one Roger Moore gets thrown out of right before he fights that evil dude on that space station.
Do I need to be prepared for something like that?
(laughs) I think we can safely rule out space travel, Boze.
Odds are, the plane flight will be the most exciting part about this trip.
Anyone else want to check out the Van Gogh Museum?
No, not me, thanks.
I brought, like, ten Willie Nelson live CDs.
I'm just gonna chill out in the van, put a dent in these.
You know they invented iTunes, right?
Yeah, but everybody knows CDs sound better.
Well, people only say that about vinyl because...
Okay.

Prior's supposed to meet her contact.
So until she shows,
I say we sit back, relax, and enjoy my man Willie.

The rest I learned from Thornton.
She may have been a traitor, but she was a hell of a spy.
Always had every angle covered, always thinking ten steps ahead.
Yeah, but you were on your seventh till you actually started to listen.
(both laugh)
Look, the thing with Bozer is...
Jack is to Mac as Mac is to Bozer.
Did you just make an analogy?
he's been doing everything he could to shield him from this world, and now he's out here in the thick of it.
Mac may seem like he's cool with Bozer being out here, but I think he's quietly freaking out on the inside, you know what I mean?

Hey, Mac, I got a match on Prior at your three o'clock... blue sweater and pearls.
Shady doesn't hold up in court though.
Matty needs video of Prior handing the codes to her contact.
She looks as nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.
Can you I.D. her contact?
It could be anybody in the square.
Or it could just be someone on her phone.
Looks like the CIA intel wasn't exactly 100% accurate.
We didn't agree...
Just-just boopidy-boop it.

It's like someone knew someone like me was gonna try and disarm it.
I-I don't have time to stop it.
Felt pretty heroic at first, but...
We're in the middle of a business district.
There really isn't a least-populated area.
Mac, how much room do you need for the blast?
Uh, okay, I'm looking at, uh, a pound and a half of NP10.
Let's say two pounds to be safe, so... pressure wave velocity of 1,030 feet per second.
I'd say air density is... approximately 1.27 kilograms per meter cubed...
Yeah, uh, Mac, I don't want to interrupt, but there's an alleyway coming up here on the right.
I need a space that's 200 feet wide!
(tires screeching)
(Bozer gasping)
Okay, everybody out, now!
I think we did it.
Nobody got hurt.
Yeah, no body got hurt, but the blast cracked my rig.
The only proof Prior's a terrorist is gone.
(sirens approaching) Hey, uh...
I don't think they're coming to thank us for saving their lives.
Yeah, it looks like it.
(shouting in Dutch)
(sirens wailing in distance)
Remind me again why we don't just grab a cop and tell them the truth?
I mean, we're not terrorists, we're secret agents from the U.S.
Operating in a foreign country without permission.
Yeah, but this country's our ally.
And you don't spy on your allies.
So even if we could convince the cops that we're not terrorists, we're still here illegally, so we'd still go to jail.
Hey, Boze,
I know you didn't sign up for this, but don't panic.
Pretty sure we're gonna get out of this just fine.
I'm looking at an explosion in Amsterdam.
Tell me it wasn't you.
We got proof that Prior was working with the terrorists.
There was just, uh... there was a little bomb in her purse that kind of exploded, destroying said proof and a bunch of buildings around it, and everybody thinks that we did it.
That's a long way from "fine," Jack.
You're about to be in the middle of a very serious international incident.
I'm enacting emergency protocol.
Sending exfil coordinates now.
Oh, I'd say they got a very good look at you.
Dutch Intelligence just launched a nationwide search for four suspects matching your descriptions.
You know what will happen if you get caught operating on Dutch soil.

(urgent chatter)

Now, I need to know who they are, who they're working for, how they got into the country, and I need to know it yesterday.
No match in our system or Interpol's.
Then search for their faces across the city's surveillance network.
(computer trilling)
Suspects just entered Zuiveringshal Park from the south.
Sounds like they're everywhere.
Stay close and keep your head down.
Don't we have, like, a... a Phoenix safe house, somewhere to duck into?
Those things take weeks to set up.
This was supposed to be a one-day observe-and-report.

Okay.
I was hoping there wasn't gonna be as many in the park.
Shh, shh.

He's out.
Oh, sorry there, Frenchy.
(Dutch chatter over radio)
When'd you learn to speak Dutch?
Uh, it's classified.
Let's boogie.
Not their current location, but I found footage of them entering the country this morning.
It's a private airport in Schiphol.
I need a backstopped cover for our exfil pilot and his helicopter.
Doesn't have to hold up forever.
Just long enough to get Mac's team through Dutch and German airspace.
Sorry, it's not a phone call.
Dutch Intelligence claims four Americans detonated a car bomb two hours ago in Amsterdam.
I've reviewed the identities of the suspects, and they have all the earmarks of U.S. operatives.
But... before I ask if they belong to any of you, let me remind you... that it's only a matter of time before they're apprehended.
And if an operative is caught spying on one of our allies, the consequences to your agency would be severe.
So, now... would anybody like to claim these people as agents?
The CIA has no affiliation with these four.
The DIA has no affiliation, ma'am.
The NSA has no affiliation.
All right, exfil's just around the corner.
No, we're right on top of the coordinates Matty sent.
So, maybe our pilot's just late?
- (high-pitched electronic squeal) - (gasping)
What the hell was that?
That would be our comms going dead.
(line beeping)
No code-in, no comms, no exfil?
Is that as bad as it sounds?
So, on a scale from one to Cairo...
Bozer, Phoenix has completely abandoned us here.
Matty severed all ties.
So we're on our own in a country where everyone thinks we're terrorists?
I can't believe Matty left us to be captured, thrown in prison.
Phoenix has 44 more agents around the world undercover.
If they claimed us, it would have put their lives in danger and exposed the agency.
And what's protocol for getting us re-avowed?
He ended up doing four years in a Chinese prison and still didn't get to go home.
Ended up living in Shenzhen, working as one of them dudes who stands in line for people.
So there's a chance that we could never go home?
Well, what are we supposed to do?
Well, right now get off the street.
Then we can worry about what happens next.
(knocks)
I was here with the CIA on an undercover op...
Jena was part of my cover... (both moaning)
(speaking French)
(shouting)
I hear you, and I'll explain everything.
Okay, can we go inside and-and talk, just... for a second?
You speak Dutch and you speak French?
Who are your friends?
Uh, Riley's the stylist.
And twisted steel and sex appeal, that's the model, old blue eyes right there, Mac.
If we could just come in and catch up, for a minute, please?
You look great.
After you, Bryce.

(speaking French)
Because I was getting scared about how I felt about you, Jen.
I know we've been cut off by our own government and the whole world thinks we're terrorists, but...
(Jack and Jenaveev continue arguing)
How you holding up?
It's hitting Bozer pretty hard, though.
I feel like an idiot.
I just wanted a taste of being a hero.
But this, this isn't like the movies.
No.
Well, in a movie, the ending's already written.
In real life, if you just stay calm... think... you can find a way out of anything.
At least that's... the way it's always worked before.
Okay, I think I smoothed things out with Jenaveev.
(shouting in French)
Well, you know, for the most part, anyway.
I don't blame the woman, Jack.
Hey, look, I know I should've told her
I was an international spy years ago, but what do you want me to do, put her life in jeopardy?
So instead, you lie to her, sleep with her, and then leave the moment your assignment is over?
You want change for that two cents' worth?
(chuckles)
What happened happened.
Just 'cause I go out and I lasso a golden unicorn on assignment, all of a sudden I'm the Evil George Clooney?
Clooney's married.
To a brilliant attorney.
Yeah, well, he hopped on a lot of lily pads before he settled on that one.
Now, look, my past is the past.
All right?
Our prints are all over that van, and the only proof we didn't do this is gone.
Pickled herring is gnarly.
Besides, the whole country already thinks we're terrorists;
let's just bounce.
(Prior speaking Dutch over TV)
Not the entire country.
We just need Olivia Prior to admit that she did this and not us.
Well, then we'll just have to meet Olivia Prior in person.
Oh, yeah, that sounds way less risky.
She's a member of parliament, Mac.
How we gonna get anywhere near her without those cameras seeing us?
Then we'll just have to make sure the cameras don't see our faces.
Hold still.
So, what do you say, Bryce?
Think that golden unicorn held onto any of your old gear?
Who's Bryce?
What?
All right.
Yeah, yeah, okay.

Not my favorite.
And I know this gig doesn't last forever, but I always thought I'd get shot or hit by a missile or fall into a nuclear reactor... some real blaze-of-glory stuff, you know?
But having my career end like this, it's... well, it's kind of embarrassing.
It's embarrassing and it's temporary.

(sighs)
Hello, Olivia.
Nice to see you again.
Let's take a ride.
Just admit you were in on the attack.
The CIA already knows you've been working with terrorists.
I would never.
I only went there because of the photos.
What photos?
A few weeks ago... (sighs) someone sent me photos of me with another man.
You need to understand,
That's what you're gonna tell us?
That's what got you blackmailed by terrorists?
It is the truth.
They were gonna post the photos online if I wouldn't do exactly what they told me.
Here.
I thought they were going to ask me for money.
Okay.
I've seen the pictures, I want to believe you, but you need to go back and explain everything exactly how it happened.
A waiter... gave me the phone, and there was a man on the phone, and he told me, get the purse from the planter box, carry it down the street, and then when I see someone follow me,
drop it and run.
Wait a second, when someone follows you?
Yes.
So the man on the phone knew that we were going to be there.
I think I know why the CIA intel was bad.
Who could do something like that?
When the man first contacted you
The first call wasn't from the man.
The first call was from the woman.
She called herself Pop.
I don't think she was referring to the cereal.
Pop is Dutch word.
And in English, it means "chrysalis."
Up until a couple of months ago, when she was arrested for treason... our boss.
We'll be in the next room if you need anything, okay?
She's just a member of parliament that we kidnapped.
If you don't believe me, go ask her.
Maybe I will.
Okay.
Olivia has agreed to stay put until we figure out what to do with her.
Any luck confirming her story?
The blackmail photos were sent from an untraceable e-mail.
But the encryption key does match the one Thornton used while selling state secrets as Chrysalis.
that way, if we start talking, she drops all that fake intel on Olivia.
Next thing you know, we're all killed in a bomb blast.
It was just luck we outed her before she could do it.
Yeah, but by then, revenge is as easy as a phone call from prison.
She had us checkmated before we even left for Amsterdam.
(door closes)
Every file with intel on MacGyver, Jack, Riley and Bozer has been destroyed, plus the backups.
So the only digital proof tying them to Phoenix is on my tablet.
Then you should delete those files fast.
Dutch Intelligence just discovered that they made a call after the bombing.
They're trying to piece together fragments of the call, which included a woman's voice.
And if they can reconstruct that call, it could lead right back to us.
Andie, unless you'd like to be an accessory to violating the Espionage Act,
I suggest you leave.
Now.
(phone beeps)
Do you recognize my voice?
Time to return the favor.
I say we march Olivia into a police station
It's for you, Mac.

Wait, wait, wait.
This might be another "gift" from Thornton.
Looks like a note.
"Sorry I can't do more, but you can help yourselves."
That's my code-in.
Harlan Wolff, blueprints of the building where he works, and the details of their domestic surveillance program.
Why would Matty send us info on the people hunting us?
Probably trying to get us out of the country.
Besides, it's always good to know who you're running from.
"You can help yourselves."
If Matty risked her entire career sending this, then it's got to do more than just help us turn tail and run.
According to these memos, Dutch Intelligence records all domestic calls, archives all CCTV video, and scoops up every bit of data transmitted within the country to...
Okay, you're getting the same look in your eye that he gets when you're about to say...
Back at the cafe, I was disguising the signals of our comms and wireless cameras as normal cell traffic routed through towers of a local Dutch telecom.
Okay, now you're just using big words that nobody else understands, like he does.
I was routing it through local cell towers.
Matty just told us Intel saves all cellular data.
So, if we can get you into Dutch Intelligence HQ, then...
I might be able to reconstruct the video that clears our names.
Yes.
The last time I checked, the only one that's cool wearing his sunglasses inside
Can't walk in there wearing these faces.
But luckily, we have a friend who can help us make new ones.
Oh, I-I don't know, Mac.
They'd have to be good.
Not maybe... they would have to be your best work.
We'd all have to be on our A-games.
We're not Phoenix agents anymore, so no one's giving orders.
We'll all have to be on board.
I'm in.
Yeah, whatever.
Let me make sure I fully understand our options.
Option one... flee Amsterdam and most likely run for the rest of our lives.
Or... option two... you all put your trust in me... and we may end up in jail today.
Okay.

Thank you.
I just got off the phone with your new friend Harlan Wolff.
After the four of you were cleared, he found this.
The man who left the bomb for Olivia Prior was an operative working for The Organization.
Dutch Intelligence apprehended him this morning, and he confessed to working for Thornton.
So, I gave him the intel he needed to add the bombing to Thornton's charges in exchange for sweeping our involvement under the rug.
It's really over.
But...
I would avoid going to Amsterdam for a little while.
Well, it's probably for the best if she never sees Bryce Villanova again, Jack.
Jack, don't call her.
Hey, man... you did a good job.
I'm proud of you.
And I'm looking forward to the next time you're in the field with us.
If you decide there is a next time.
Thanks, Mac.
Man, am I glad to see you!

Remember when I said this job was boring?
Well, it's not... and for the time being, this is all the excitement I want.
