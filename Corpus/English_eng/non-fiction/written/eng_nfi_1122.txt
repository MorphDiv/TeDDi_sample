Previously on Greenleaf.
Any fresh libel in the paper about us this morning, Jacob?
Just this Friday feature about churchgoers in the DA's office,
Written by this Darius Nash?
I really don't know how all this is gonna end.
And all the side deals that he's making.
I can't lose half the deacon board over a choir director.
You knew I was gay.

Reggie and I getting married.
It's a program for guys who are dealing with a similar issue.
We wanted the bishop to do this wedding.
You never would have been my first choice.
Zora snuck out of the conference and Sophia covered for her.
I want to get baptized.
Kevin and Charity might be divorcing.
We will be seeking your guidance.
Do you have a lawyer yet?
When you get one, have him call me.
It was rated number one most beautiful college in the country.
I'm sure it's very beautiful.
Yeah.

Is that what you want to study?
You already know what your major is, sweetheart?
Maybe.
I don't know.
It'd be so simple to just go to college here.
Would you please, please, please just give me the money for the application fee?
Well, Rhodes might be the simplest option, sweetheart, but that doesn't make it the best one.
Are you trying to get rid of me?
No.
I just know college is a big choice.
I want you to think big, honey.
Going to the most beautiful campus in the country seems pretty big.
Well, life is more than beauty.
You got a lot of spice this early, baby.
Parentals.
- I'm making eggs.

I'll go with a yogurt.
So, here's the thing.
Yes?
I would like to have a reexamination of this "no dating" policy.
It's not a "no dating" policy.
It's a "no reprobate thug" policy.
Isaiah's not a thug.

- He's Christian.

That's a thing.

Just give him another chance.
No.
One week with that boy, and you were lying and sneaking around.
Don't make him pay for my mistakes.
I'm the one with the problem here.
What are you thinking?
What... what are you thinking?
I would like to invite him to Sophia's birthday party.
No lying, no sneaking.
Just good, clean Christian fun.
Two peas in a pod.
As long as you don't leave the premises.
Look at us...

I got to say, you two,
I am proud to be part of the process.
And, as stipulated in our memorandum of understanding,
Mr. Satterlee will be responsible for his debts incurred during the marriage?
That's correct.
And the same for Miss Greenleaf?
Yes, and you'll find that all broken down in today's addendum.
And finally, in the matter of Nathan Satterlee, both parties agree to joint custody?
Yeah, but we have one question.
It looks like I'll be going to Nashville fairly regularly, more often than I originally thought.
Is that right?
Kevin, what Charity might suggest might actually be a blessing.
Remember... look for God's hand at work in what you fear the most.
- I'm looking.

So you can run off with Jabari?
I'm not running off with Jabari.
Kevin, I'm pursuing my career.
With another man in Nashville.
Well, what do you care?
Why don't we stop for today?
Kevin.

He knows about your songwriting, right?
- This publishing deal?

Okay, so then what was that all about?
Who knows?
Your mom asked me to look out for you and the family here.
If there's something I should be aware of
- that could potentially hurt...

So there's nothing going on between you and Jabari
- that Kevin could use...

Kevin's just...

I shouldn't have said it.
Shouldn't have said what?
Nothing.
Thanks for your help.
- No?

Oy.

I don't feel like I'm being much of a help, but I was expecting to at least have to, like, look under a hood.
No, it's nice just to have another human being to turn to occasionally who isn't trying to sell me a car.
Well, you are here to buy one.
Yeah, I know.

It's just so oppressive to me... sales.
You know, I think of that poor caveman sitting there with the dead bird that he found, just sitting and waiting for somebody to walk by to sell it to.
For what?
- What do you mean?

Like, for what money in this prehistoric capitalistic fantasy of yours?
I don't know.

Okay, a piece of fire.
Whatever.
A sharp rock.

A sharp rock.
And then the next day, there's another caveman next door who's sitting there with his own dead bird.
I just think it's all so lonely, you know?
Yeah.
Isn't there a verse in Genesis that justifies working?
Yeah, as punishment.
But even then, it's supposed to be work that involves the sweat of the brow, not selling.
Something went wrong.

And then sales.
You should preach about that.
I wouldn't know what to say.
You just said it.
Well, this isn't the car.
So... what would I have to do to get you in my car tomorrow night?
It's Sophia's birthday.
- Hence the car.

And my mother's insisted on this whole thing at the house, which I haven't invited you to.
I wasn't going to say it.
Would you want to come?
Are you ready to spring me on the folks?
Because if you're not, I...
No, no, no.

Let's do it.
Let every adverse force converge.
So, what do I get her?
Some fuzzy dice?
All right, I'll see what I can do.
Can I help you folks today?
- Yeah, I'll take it.

Yeah, I know.

Okay, then.
I'll get the paperwork.
So, how did the morning go?
As well as can be expected.
Tell me more.
I think he's going to try for sole custody.
Well, that will never happen.
He knows.

Well, why are the two of you breaking up?
Why does that matter, Mama?
Because if Kevin cheated on you...
He didn't!
He didn't do anything.
And promise me there is nothing between you and this Lafcadio boy.
- Jabari?

No, there isn't.
I'm the good sister, remember?
My Lord.
So, what is it, then?
For nearly a year, the two of you have been at odds.
Back and forth on the sofa, out the house, back in.
What is it?
Charity, are you prepared to lose custody of your child over the questionable pleasure of keeping a secret?
Are you?
Because... everything will come out sooner or later.
There is not a pocket of darkness that the light of God won't find.
Have you not read your Bible?
Mama.
Charity, what pain has this man caused?
Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful and so worship...
Pastor Greenleaf.
- Should I come back?

Just let me get to the end of this verse here.
And so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.
- Hebrews 12.

Eight more books, I'm going to have this baby memorized.
How can I be of assistance?
Mr. Bass Reeves.
What about him?
I was going through the rolls and, you know, thinking I would try to find someone.
Scrounge someone up who might be able to assist with the legal fees while we deal with this injunction.
You are something else, you know that?
You're walking pure initiative.
I appreciate you something fierce.
- Just doing my job.

- I did.

Okay, so who is he?
I mean, he's given us so much money, but every number is out of service.
Every email bounces back.
- Every street address is...

So you do know the man.
Who is he?
I guess we got time.
Have a seat.
Why?
Go on, just have a seat.

Now I'm going to tell you... a story about the jack of hearts.
And the two ladies in his life that kept him on the run.
Keep an eye on your boy.
So, where's the jack?
There.
No.
And he's not here either.
So that means he's got to be... there.
And that's the end of that story.
All right, but what's that story got to do with Bass Reeves, the mystery man?
Yeah, if you could send her an admission packet, that'd be great.
Yeah, I am an alum.
Class of 1998.
That's...

Thank you.

- Hey.

Yeah.

So we'll see.
I'm in trouble.
Well, not full-on trouble.
Eugenia Davis just called and she told me what transpired last week before Simone called off the wedding.
What did you do with that couple you counseled?
Did Tasha go crying to Kerissa?

Sure.
Yeah, I had a feeling.
It's all good.
Well... after Daddy died, I had to help Mama make ends meet.
And I ain't much one to work the register at the Waffle House like she did.
Although I understand now they got a pretty respectable stock program.
I went down to Beale Street, and I seen this cat working "Find the Lady."
And I watched him and watched him until one night,
I went out and stole my own apple crate and went into business for myself.
Put my own twist on it, of course.
You ever play poker?
Now you're talking my game now.
I'm a shark at that table.
I had a feeling.
Pick out your card, see what you got.
How many do you want?
I'll sit.
You want to put some money on?
You must be sitting on something real nice there.
- Twenty bucks.

You're not going to look at your cards?
Don't have to.
Show me what you got, Jaws.
Tens, kings, ace high.
The royal family.
Bass Reeves is you.
A part of me, yes.
And all this money he's giving us?
Is money I win in a floating game and hand right back, without fail, to the Lord for his purpose.
Money you win by cheating.
No.

That's a quick way to get you killed.
Come on.

Where are we going?
To the Men's Prayer Lunch.
I almost forgot about that.
You didn't "almost," man.

I just wish once somebody would call me and say,
"That daughter of yours is such a beacon of faith.
What a pleasure it is to have her back."
You and me both, Daddy.
It's not where I'm at.
I'm sorry.
I'm trying.
As long as you know there's a problem, there's hope.
I'll handle Simone and Preston.
Hey, Daddy?
Yes?
I was thinking about bringing a guest to Sophia's birthday party tomorrow night.
Your mother and I were wondering when you'd start seeing someone again.
Who is he?
Darius Nash.
That muckraker?
The journalist.
I'll get back to you.
What even is that stuff?
It's green juice.

He says it's good for, like, health stuff.
Hey, you want to come over today and help me make a playlist for the party?
I can't.
Isaiah has band practice.
And you have to stand at attention and adore him while he plays?
He has a hard time managing the band if I'm not there.
He's too nice.
But when I'm there, he takes charge.
We'll be at the party.
He's coming with you?
Yeah, I had to go to the warden, get permission for the conjugal visit.
You know, the whole nine.
No.

Anything under 120, it's like you're watching TV.

That was a solid message.
Once we get that church of yours up and running, Pastor, you're going to enter a whole new chapter of greatness.
Whoa!

What's up?
That floating poker game I told you about just floated back into view.
Hey, any chance you want to join?
- When?

I'll bank you.
You know what?

Would have been fun.
I mean, now if it's a work thing...
Well, you'll be spending the evening with one of our biggest donors.
That sure sounds like a work thing to me.
I'll tell Kerissa.
Maybe we can have the game at your place.
It seems the venue they'd been planning on closed down.
Well, I don't have to tell Kerissa everything.
Job 11 and 7.

Nothing wrong with that.
Kevin is gay.
What?
I was just connecting the bishop's Ethernet cable.
His connection's been real slow.
I'll go now.
Loose lips sink ships.
Understood.
Where did you hear this?
Charity.
Of course, she couched it in all kinds of equivocations.
"Kevin's having issues.

But he has been going to Fortitude for Families, and men don't go there because they love women.
So this is why they're breaking up.
And why I want him out.
Out of what?
Our house.

All of it.
Our daughter is suffering this indignity every day.
At home, at work.
- I won't have it.

He's Nathan's father.
I don't want to set us up for some sort of class action.
And why are you being so sanguine?
I'm not being sanguine at all.
I just got my own issues right now.
What now?
- Gigi.

Look, your mother says no.
"Never."
And, "Why?

So, no.
Well, thanks for trying.
I didn't try.
Thanks for telling me that.
Do you honestly think that this man is part of God's plan for your life?
Or do you just like that it vexes your mother and insults me?
Of course I don't like that part.
It just doesn't seem optimal that a birthday party for Sophia be used as a coming-out party.
For anyone.
I get it, Daddy.
Good.

Can you grandmasters set the table?
All right.
All right, come on, Maurice Ashley.
Let's wash your hands.
Good job, buddy.
How's that going?
My goodness.

He's got me running for my life over there.
I mean, he's scary good.
My God.

I know.
Ris, about tomorrow night...
- What?

I don't know who learned it from who, but wow.
No, go ahead.
I got a work thing then.
Isn't that convenient.
I won't do it if you tell me not to do it.
No way.
Live with yourself.
I mean, if you're going to be mad now.

I'm not mad.

Some people get the grain, and some get what's left on the threshing room floor.
So you just do what you need to do.
We're all good.
Kevin.
Linger for a moment if you would.
I need to bend your ear.
What's up, Ma?
Ooh.
It looks great in here.
Well, thank you.

So, what's up, Ma?
As a confidante to so many women through the years, parishioners who have gone through divorce,
I've seen every permutation of what goes wrong with negotiations.
Yeah?
And I just wanted to let you know, quite often events take a turn, and reconciliation becomes a possibility when you least expect it.
But only if both parties keep a close watch on what they have to lose in the process.
It's one of those rare instances where self-interest can inspire generosity.
I'll keep that in mind.
Because I'd just hate to see this whole thing spin out of control, to the point that all the dirty laundry's on the lawn.
I'm sure you understand.
Yeah.
I knew you would.
You see, I know you.

Hey, you.
Hey.
Turns out finding fuzzy dice that don't smell like cigarette or weed is a lot harder than you'd think.
So...
I got her a car emergency kit.
Aww, Darius.
You already got her one?
No, I just...
That's very sweet.
Thank you.
Everything okay?
Not exactly.
They don't want me to come.
Yeah.

I knew it wouldn't be simple.
Can we get dinner on Sunday?
I'll buy.
Hello?
Maybe we should just be friends.
Friends?
I mean, I've always said a relationship starts, that's the way it's always going to be.
You know, and I'm not saying that... we were wrong for trying to beat that.
But let's just be friends.
You mean like friends that don't see each other very often?
Whatever.

Whatever works.
Look, you're a pastor, Grace, and I'm never going back to church.
So this was probably always just...
A mistake?
No.

Look, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Still got to find this emergency kit a home.
Okay.
Bye.
Can you summarize this for us?
I'll be honest.
I didn't come here today expecting this many changes.
Well, your client gets 30% of the marriage trust, flexible visitation to be negotiated in good faith,
$1,100 per month for child support, and should your client ever be terminated by the church, he'd be prohibited from taking any legal action.
- Period.

Let me see that.
Kevin, I didn't know about this.
Why wouldn't you tell me about that?
Let's just sign this and be done.
I'm not going to let you sign this thing.
I don't remember asking you for permission.
You'll have to sign a malpractice waiver for me before you sign.
That's fine.
Kevin.
Kevin.
Kevin, wait.
You told her?
I'm sorry.
You win.
- Hey, brother.

Zora, hurry up.

Honey, have you seen my phone?
Yeah, right here.
You're being awfully helpful tonight.
I just feel bad I'm not coming.
If having dinner with this donor helps us get out of this house, I'm all for it.
- Zora!

- Where is this dinner?

How late do you think you're going to be?
Bye, sweetie.

Probably not too late.
Okay.
Go, go, go, go, go.
All right, see you later.

Brother Greenleaf.
- She just left.

That's a good color for you.
You know what, Charity?
Don't act like everything's cool between us.
You told your mother I'm gay, which means it's only a matter of time before everybody thinks that it's true.
Just stay out of my business.
- Hey, Mom.

This is Roberto.
It's so nice to meet you.
It's nice to meet you too, Pastor.
So you live out this way, or...?
No, we're in midtown.

- Rhodes College.

Yeah, I've heard of it.
Yeah, my mom's dean of academic affairs.
Okay.

- It's an amazing school, Mom.

Well, Dad wants me to go somewhere in Phoenix.
Would that be better?
You can have the application fee.
You can apply to Rhodes.
- Thank you.

Come on, let's go mingle.
- Ma'am.

Likewise.
Somebody's got a boyfriend.
I know it.
I cannot believe it.
My God.
How are you doing?
With what?
You know, you and Kevin and everything.
It's for the best.
Thank you.
Look at him!

- Hey.

Well, our son couldn't be bothered?
He had a work thing.
A work thing?

It's Isaiah.

Well, considering Jacob doesn't have a church and his senior pastor's a fraud,
I find it hard to imagine what a work thing would be.
Come on, come on, come on.
But the devil finds work for idle hands.
Come on, let's put that down, get Winkie a cupcake.
And you...
Work thing.
Hey.
Hey.
Look, I'm sorry about today.
Yeah, me too.
Hey, hey, could you guys do me a favor, please, and pull Sophia's car around for me?
I think we're going to start opening presents soon, and that bow is a two-man job, you know?
Whatever you need.
Thank you.

Thank you.
Gentlemen, the bet is 10,000.
I'm tempted, but...
I'm done.
Fold.
Ten... raise 10.
- After that flop?

All right, then.
What say you?
Hell.
I feel you, Skip.
You can't be serious.
- Lookee here, lookee here.

I'll see you.

Let me see them.
Ace-high flush.
Posterized.
You all see that, don't you?
Slow down.

Slow.
Kings over queens.
That's what I call a holy silence.
Yes, indeed.

Roaring fire.
Quiet as the grave.
That's insane, man.

- Good game, fellas.

Gonna be a long ride home.
Enjoyed you, brother.

Don't ever doubt me, Jacob.
My parents gave me a pickup.
Dodge Ram 4x4, fire-engine red with a lift kit.
How about you?
Bought myself a used Corolla for 750.
It drove like crap, but it got me around.
Nice.
Not bad.
Last but not least...
From grandma and grandpa.
I wonder what this can be?
Okay.
It has a literal translation from the Hebrew and the Greek.
If you ever need that sort of thing.
I will.

You're welcome, dear.
Use it well.
Are we done now?
Not quite.
What's in here?
Take a look, sweetheart.
I love tiny boxes.
No way.
Well...
That deserves an applause.
Hey, Kevin.
What's up?
You know, once the smoke clears and all this legal stuff is behind you,
if you ever need someone to talk to... about whatever...
Thanks.
No, you didn't!
- Are you serious?

This is too much.
That is...
- You like it?

My God.
We should, take it for a spin.
Can we, Mom?

Come on, it's Sophia's birthday.
- Please?

Be home by 11:00.
I'll have them both home with time to spare, Mrs. Greenleaf.
That's a promise.
- Yes, yes, yes!

My gosh!
Y'all in?
Seat belts.

You look so good in this car.

- Yes, I do.

- Thank you, Mom.

Have fun.
Not too much fun.
Okay.

Birthday girl!
That's so good.
So, we wait till Sunday to stick this in some envelopes with made-up names,
Now, I chose Bass Reeves because he was the real Django back in the day.
- Black U.S. Marshal.

- He was a real dude?

You can make up a name for yourself.
And if you want my advice, pick a good one.
It'll make everything feel more...

Drop it in the plate.
Well, speaking of legal...
Yes, sir.

What about the law?
Or even God's law?
You're okay with this?
I love you asked that.
If you didn't, I'd have my doubts.
Here's my gloss on the matter, and of course you have your own.
The spiritual danger, when it comes to gambling, is twofold.
If you do it for the love of money, and if you do it depending on luck.
That is to say, depending on something other than God.
Now, I'm giving all this back to the church, so it's not for the love of money.
And I can count on only the Lord to keep me ahead, so there's no intervening power upon which I am calling or depending on.
So I'm at a loss to see what's wrong.
And you're really okay with giving all that... to the church?
Why not?
It's all God's money.
Maricel, let's keep all the peonies and send the rest to Lamplighters in the morning.
And let's get all the gifts upstairs for when Sophia comes home.
She'd love to find them there.
Yes, ma'am.
My God.
There you are.
I have to tell you that I felt like
I was in the Twilight Zone tonight, remembering all the parties that I threw for you, Grace and Faith.
It was a beautiful night, Mama.
No.

Because it wouldn't be a night if someone wasn't after me for something.
I won't let you fire Kevin.
Well, I have no immediate plans to.
You had Aaron put that clause in.
Because I wanted to be sure that we were protected if this war between the two of you were to escalate.
Mama!
I mean it.
I see you're sincere, dear.
I still feel bad about Carlton, and how all of that went down.
I won't let you do that to the father of my child.
Well, let's pray we don't have to.
I know you feel bad about what you were sharing with me, but if you saw it from my vantage point,
I know you'd have done the same.
Family comes first.
And I'll take this sad one.

- Yes, ma'am.

Family comes first.

Winkie wants his good-night kiss.
All right, I'll be right there.
What are you looking at?
Bass Reeves.
Who's that?
Some black gunslinger.
And why are you reading about him?
No reason.
How was the party?
Your mother was rude, your father was pouty, and the house was not this.
Well, we'll be out of here soon enough.
That's the plan.
I haven't bowled since I was a kid.
Let's go to The Row.
We said we were going here.
We had to tell them we were going somewhere.
That doesn't mean we have to go.

But...
Just come.
It'll be more fun than this.
Bowling?
I don't want to go to The Row.
Come on.

Isaiah's friend works there.
There'll be beer.
I can get you a birthday beer.
No.
Then is it okay if I go?
No, it's not okay.
This is my birthday.
You're busy every other day with him.
Can't you just stick with me for this one night?
- I'm not always with him.

I can't even have a conversation with you for five minutes without you texting him, talking about him, running off.
You need his permission?
I would never do to you what you're doing to me right now.
It's not cool.
Come on.
Hello.
Just putting a little inscription in Sophia's Bible.
I see that.
What are you saying?
Just my own little gloss on Deuteronomy 32 and 2.
"May my teachings fall like rain.
"May my words descend like dew.
"Like showers on the green leaves.
With love, from us to you."
Daddy.
You gave her a study Bible.
I gave one to you too, didn't I?
But not Charity, not Faith.
And your point is?
I don't want Sophia to follow in my footsteps, Daddy.
Especially when they've led me to such a... confusing place.
Sophia came to me the day before yesterday and expressed an interest in teaching the Little Saints.
That's why I gave it to her.
She didn't tell me that.
Probably because she was so scared you'd direct her away from doing it.
What a fearful place it must be to finally find yourself bathing in the glow of a brand-new faith,
and think your own mother would treat it like a sickness or a stupid mistake.
- I wouldn't do that.

I don't know that.
And my guess is, you probably don't know it either.
What is it going to take, Gigi, to bring you back into the fold?
Put Mac in jail.
Gigi.
Yeah, Daddy?
Vengeance is mine.
Anybody tries to take the wheel of this world from God... is going to find themselves in a ditch real quick.
You think on these things.
