Mr. Wheeler.

Hey, we have someone in common.
Jesus, you had a fucking night, huh?
I need to know that you were in fear for your life.
I was in fear for my life.
Just two fucking Velociraptors pulling a midday shift.
Unbridled.
I beat the fucking life out of him.
What'd Alvey say?
He said I'm lucky I didn't break my hand.
Looking out for your career, right?
His... his, too.
It was a home invasion
My father fought.

You wanna be a Kulina, you gotta learn how to handle yourself.
It's in the DNA.
- Kayla.

- What are you doing here?

You need to go home.
Your fight, man.
You to drag this cocksucker to the deep end and drown this motherfucker, okay?
Faggot.
- Nothing.

Kulina.
Hello?
Yeah, this is him.
Yeah.

Is he hurt?
No, no.

Yeah.

The one by Rose?
All right, I appreciate it.
I'll...

- Thanks for the call.

So we threw a blanket on him.
We also found a needle in the cab.
Jesus.

Jay?
Jay, come on.

Jay.

Can you turn the light off?
- Need help getting him home?

- No, I'll get him home.

Thanks again.
- Yeah, have a good night.

You want me to come in?
No.

You sure you don't want to keep some for yourself?
For what?
Well, I hate to be the one you break this to you, but... how 'bout some new fucking clothes, eh?
You wear the same shitty things every day.
Yeah.
Yes, I'd like to make a donation, please.
You're in the right place.
Would you like to direct the money to any specific services?
- Like what?

Uh, wherever it helps, I guess.

Mm.

Um, $5,000.
Wow.
That's, uh, that's...

You all right?
Yeah.
What happened to your face?
Are we good?
Yeah, just leave your name and information.
We'll send you a receipt so you can write it off.
No, I-I'd like it to be anonymous, please.
You should take the tax break.
I just wanna leave the cash.
Yeah?

Do I feel good?
No.
But you're only as sick as you think you are, Doc.
You start thinkin' about your pain, and then your mind slips.
And then you don't know if you're hurt or you just think that you're hurt.
You become weak.
You start identifying with frailty, and then before you fucking know it, you are a sick guy.
But you're still in pain.
Yeah.
Doctors haven't found anything?
Doctors.
Canceled all of 'em.
Imbeciles.
Fucking doctors.
They don't tell you anything.
I'm not living that fucking life, sitting in waiting rooms.
Nobody has any answers about anything.
I mean, if it's just pain I gotta deal with, that's...
I can do that.

But, Alvey, if there's a medical condition, it... it needs to be diagnosed.
Why?

What?

My son Jay's not doin' too well.
His girlfriend left him, took the kid.
It's his fault.

But threw him off course a bit.
Sucks, too, 'cause he was...

He had a family, he had a...

He quit fighting.

The kid's gifted.
I wanna do something for him.
I wanna get him back in the gym, you know?
I think he's got five good years if he still wants 'em.
I was a shit father.
But I think maybe, as a man,
I can...

Why do you think he quit in the first place?
He resents it.

We're very similar.
He's more emotional than I was, but... he hates his father, just like I did.
Typical shit.
Have you talked to Jay about any of this?
He won't talk to me.
He won't really even look at me.
I don't blame him.
He's gotta be careful, though, man.
He's getting older.
And at some point, Doc, you are what you are.
Hey.
Hey, Ryan.
One sec, Ryan.
Ohh.
Pick up your phone.
- Can you hear me?

Hey.
Hi.

I can see that.
And guess what else?
I have something else to share.
What?
I am no longer the penis on the fruit guy in here.
What?
Like, because I'm...

It's like it never even happened, Ryan.
Yeah.

I know, and it's so much better now.
I can't even begin to tell you.
I feel safe anywhere except racial violence, which we are all subject to.
Well, now you know how to defend yourself.
You know how to fight, right?
Yeah.
Grr.
It sounds like you're doing all right, man.
Well, they finally got me on the right medicine.
That helped.
How are you?
I'm good.
Just really wanted to see you.
I miss having you around.
- Really?

We had fun, dude.
We did.

Yeah.
I do wish that I had gotten on this medication a long time ago.
I wonder what my life would be like, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I-I want you to know that you're not alone in here.
You're my brother, Keith.
I love you.
You understand?
I love you.
And I'm gonna visit you all the time.

I'm not forgetting about you.
Ryan, I will...

- Then...

We'll be sitting on these phones in our fucking diapers, I guess, 'cause I'm not leaving you.
I'm not leaving you, dude.
Hey, walk me through your day.
Um...

And Garza is a shot caller.
But you could beat him up, Ryan.
He's strong, but you could beat him up, for sure.
For sure.
We don't need him.
Everything's going smoothly.
Well, who is he?
I hate those guys.

Oh, yeah, I'm sure he is.
We don't need supervision.
Fine.
Yeah, we'll be here.
Yes, I'm fucking mad.
Goodbye.
Girls!

Kayla.

Come in here, please.
I just got off the phone with Terry.
He's doing better, but he's gonna be in the hospital a little while longer.
In the meantime, a new guy's gonna be moving in here with us.
Why?
To supervise.
Why?

Because it's what Terry wants.
And it's not up for discussion.
Well, what's he like?

I don't know.

And we're all gonna make the best of it, so go straighten up your rooms.
Let's make a good impression.
Huh.
Hello.
Hi.
I'm looking for Lisa Prince.
Why?
Well, you're not by any chance Lisa?
That depends on who you are.
I am Jeremy Johnson.
With Khalis Capital.
We're the guys that bought King Beast.
I've been sent here to find the woman who took us for a million dollars.
Yeah, sorry about that.
Is there somewhere we can talk?
Look, I'm not opening up Alvey's deal.
No, I'm here on new business.
Garo said it was Arab money.
Mm-hmm.

No.

No, you're thinking of Riyadh.
But we have offices in New York and London, if you prefer.
Look, my bosses, they weren't happy with the fee you negotiated for your fighter, Alvey.
We feel he was worth a quarter of that.
He's worth what he's paid.
Well, he doesn't get close to that without you.
Look, Lisa...
We don't see a future for Garo Kassabian at King Beast.
Okay, Garo's a friend of mine.
I understand, and he's a nice personality.
But the fact is, you took him to the woodshed.
See we wanna grow the sport.
We wanna compete with Bellator and even the UFC.
And to do that, we need someone who knows how to get a deal done in this business.
He built that promotion from the ground up.
Yeah, and we paid him well for it.
See this is about our future, a future we would love you to be a part of.
My bad.
Yeah?
Wanted to let you know I'm here.
Okay.
Yeah.

Hey.

- Jeremy Johnson.

I'm sorry.

Okay, no, I understand this is awkward for you.
It is.
But you're not taking anyone's job.
It'll be you or someone else.

My cell is on that card.
I'd love to continue this conversation when you're ready.
- Pleasure to meet you, Lisa.

So have you thought about what you're gonna do?
About what?
About the guy calling you a faggot at the fight.
I'm gonna ignore it.
Solid plan.
I'm kidding.
Your brother knows, your mom knows.
Will...
Cat's out of the bag, isn't it?
Your dad's gonna hear about it one way or another.
Tell him before someone else does.
I get it.
Do you?
Yes.
Good.
'Cause it's gonna happen.
Hey, look, I'm not saying your dad's gonna bake you a fucking cake,
but it's gonna feel better than you think.
You don't even know the weight you've been carrying.
I promise you, okay?
Hmm.
Carla.

How you doing?

Uh, she's home.

Hmm.

- Yeah.

Oh, hey, buddy.
What's happening?
Mackles, how's Shelby doing, man?
She's all right.
She's on bed rest.

Oh.

I'm glad you're here, though.
I need to wrestle you.
Real hard.

Mm-hmm.

I need to get around you like a boa constrictor.
Just get all nuts to butts on you.
- I gotta talk to Alvey first.

Okay.

- You... you'll come back here?

Hey, Mac, get your kit out.
What do you need?
I need the Chinese menu.

What up, Juan?

Muscles.
Come in.
Hey.

How you doin'?
Matza matza.
You wanna die?
- Some day.

Do you wanna die?
'Cause the cop found a needle in the truck.
That was an old needle.
Cut the shit, Jay.
I didn't tell the cops to call you.
Hmm?
Here's the deal.
I want you here, okay?
You need to be here, but no fucking needles.
You fuck with that shit, it's gonna kill ya.
Yeah.

I know that.

Okay?
Now I think you got another run at this, you get your shit together.
I believe that.
Is that it?
Yep.
Just get with Lisa.

Come over here.

Go get some work in.
Hello?
Hi!

Yeah.

Kayla.
Kayla.
Terry didn't mention you.
I'm kinda new.
- Where were you before?

- With who?

- Ugh.

You must be Cody.
I'm Christina.
Hi.
Take my bag in my room.
How many girls do we have now?
- Four.

Kayla.

Hmm.
Couple weeks.
A couple weeks ain't that fresh.
All right.
I'm-a go take a piss, and then you and me, we need to sit down, go over the numbers, see who we're cuttin' loose.
You've been keeping track of that shit, yeah?
- Of course.

I wanna see their social media, too.

Who's calling you?
Nobody.
Terry give you that phone?
No.

Mm-hmm.
Where's my bathroom?
Back there to the right.
Oh, shit.
Hey, it's me again.
Uh, do me a favor and give me a call when you get this.
I wanna tell you about what happened last night, okay?
Call me.

Yo.
Yo.

What are we doing today?
You tell me.
I follow you, Coach.
- Oh.

Well, we were gonna watch some tape and then get in the cage and work a bit, but now we only have time for one, so what's it gonna be?
I'd rather get in the cage.
Tell Juan to glove up.
I'm sick of sparring with Juan.
Jay's here.
I'd rather work with my coach, go over a game plan, but it sounds like you're done for the day?
I've been here all fucking day, brother.
Where you been?
I'm here.

Glove up and meet me in the cage.
Yes, sir.
Victory is reserved for those who pay the price, gentlemen.
What the fuck?
Mm!
- B12.

Ohh.

Yeah, I don't wanna be tender, Lisa.
Mac and I are about to roll.
Yeah, okay.

- I gotta take a shit.

- Yeah.

Okay, it's about to be.

Let the man go.

Hurry up, will you, please?
Like, 20 minutes.
That is not healthy.
He eats like a jumbo catfish, Lisa.
Did you talk to Alvey?
I did.
And?

Jay, I can pay you $900 a week to teach classes, but you gotta show up.
I thought you had Dom for that.
Yeah, he's not long for this world.
Ryan seems to have a real thing for him, though.
Well, Ryan doesn't pay him, I do, and I'd rather pay you until I can get you a fight.
But I never said I was gonna take a fight.
Yeah, I know.
But we can just... see what's out there.
I know Garo would kill to have you.
You can always turn it down.
Is that a yeah?
"Yes, Lisa,
- and thank you so much."

- "You're the best manager ever."

Welcome back.
You smell like cigarettes.
Hmm.
This shit's pretty flat.
They've all been steady.
Steady?
Okay.
What's the deal with this Kayla chick?
She's new.

Really?

She just needs to do more shows.
- She fucking lazy or what?

She's... just a little green.
Uh-huh.
Kayla!
What's up?
Hi.

You like to fuck?
Yeah.
You like a big cock.
I don't know.
Oh, you don't know?
Well, how big?
Nine inches.
No fucking way.

- It's not that big.

There's no way I could take that.
I mean, I don't know, unless you, like, really helped me.
She's adorable.
How the fuck is she not making bank?
Well, she's doing fine.
No.

Look at that ass.
Look at that ass.
She should be killing it.
She's only doing Platinum from now on.
Wait, really?
Fuck, yeah.

Finally.
You wanna take me back, show me your room?
Yeah, you wanna see it?
- I think I probably should, yeah.

Hey.
We're getting a new girl tonight.
So look at the list and figure out who's leaving.
- We're cutting someone tonight?

Oh, you're so tiny.
- Ohh, no, fucking fat, Mac.

I'm actually the lightest I've been in about a month.
Fine.
- No, no, no.

No, no, no.
Damn it!
- What?

Oh, shit.
Aw, shit.
Yeah.

And man conquered giant.
- Get off.

Ahh.
That sucked.
What are you giving him?
You can't ask me that.
For pain, not the other shit.
Okay.

This guy's good.

I'm giving him some Percocet and a shot of Toradol when he needs it.
Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up.
Come on.

What about the liquid morphine?
See how you're getting frustrated?
I want you to frustrate him.

I want you to frustrate him.
Hey.

He's in a lot of fucking pain.
Whoa!
Easy!

Does anyone here want to actually fucking work?
Get fucking serious!
Who wants to fuck...

No, you're not serious!
- All right, who here wants to go?

Who wants to fucking go?

Who wants to fucking go?

Let's go.

Who wants to go?

You done?

- Let's go.

Ah!
Time, Coach.
Time!
- Hey, hey.

Hey!

- Alvey!

Get off him.

Come on.

Hey!

Where you going?

- Come on, fucking bitch!

- Hey, hey, hey.

You're the one...
No wonder why you...

I can't even feel you, you fucking pussy.
Get off me.

- Is that how you train?

You're going through the fucking motions!
There's no fucking plan!
- You're a fucking head case!

You gave me a bunch of fucking generic shit, bro.
You're a fucking head case,
- My son beat the shit out of you!

You little bitch!

Get out of my gym.
Talk like you come from someplace.
Suck on my fucking dick.
Don't talk like you come from someplace.
Come over here!

You don't have a cock!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Get him the fuck outta here!
No.

- I'll fucking kill you.

Is Monique leaving?
Yes, she is.
That sucks.
She'll be fine.
Who's the new girl gonna be?
I don't know.

Do you know what, like...

She's Cody's girl.

Does she look like me?
I don't know.

We need, like, a black girl.
Like, we don't... we don't need, like, a girl that looks like me.
Kayla...
I don't know what decisions he's gonna make.
Do you think I'm safe?
You're safe tonight.
I'm...

Okay.
Fucking Ryan, I mean...
I don't know what the hell's wrong with the guy.
Nothing's changed.

I think he has someone in his ear.
Dom?
- Really?

Huh.
You wanna handle this or should I?
No, he's my fuck up.

All right.

I will.

Ryan'll get over it.
Yeah.
Hey, Who was the, uh, who was the suit you were talking to today?
Uh, Jeremy Johnson.
He works for the company that bought out Garo.
Oh.
Everything cool with my deal?
Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

No, of course not.
He just came by to introduce himself since we have two fighters who are headlining his card.
- Two?

- Huh.

- Yeah.

- We are all very clear about that.

- And I am fucking sensitive.

I'm a fighter.

What... what are you doing right now?
Let's...

No, thank you.
- You sure?

All right.

Okay.
Black House, American Top Team,
Team Alpha Male, fucking AKA, but I don't...

They all want me... but I don't even listen because I'm fucking loyal.
You left for... for Jackson, right?
That was a long time ago.
Hey.
Hey, listen.
Alvey the coach...
Here.

Alvey the coach, he knows that his gym ain't shit without you.
But he's not thinking that right now.
He's training for a fight.
That's where his head's at.
How do you feel when you're in camp?
You fun to be around?
- No.

You're a cocksucker, right?
You're a motherfucker.
Dude, you're irritable, you're stressed, you're about to walk into a fucking cage, and you're about to go to war, right?
Yeah.
Buddy, that's where Alvey's at.
He's not your coach right now.
He's a fighter.
Now having said that, you're not getting the coaching or the attention that you deserve.
I'd love to help with that.
You wanna be my coach?
No.

Buddy, Alvey's your coach.
Alvey's your coach.

You know, make sure everything's buttoned up.
Know what I mean?
Maybe that could work.
Yeah?
Hey, right?
I mean... little touchy, you know what I mean?
I don't give a fuck about politics, man.
I got a fucking fight.
I agree.
I agree.
I'm thinking that if... if... if you wanna... you wanna have a conversation with Lisa, you know,
I-I think that...

I mean, I'd do it, but... you know it can't come from me.
It can't come from me.
Either way, I got...

You're so bad at this.
Ah, I'm so bad at this.
How about you...
Hey.

- Just can't figure how to shoot.

Hey.
Gentlemen.
- Give me a minute.

Hey, I heard about last night.
I fell asleep on the beach staring at the night sky.
It was not a police matter.
I need you to get your shit together.
My shit is together.
Could be so much fucking worse right now.
I'm gonna tell Dad, and I need you to be around for that.
Can you do that for me, please?
I can.
No more fucking shit up.
- No more disappearing.

Full stop.
Jay, it's me.
You took something out of my bathroom that I fucking need, and I want it back.
Call me.

Fuck.
Well, I prefer natural.
Enzo?
Uh, yeah, the same place off Lincoln.
Wait, mine or yours?
Wait, what?
You walking to my fucking car or something?
Yeah, dude.

Were we on a date?
I'm feeling a little sensitive.
You can't be sensitive in this business, bro.
Hey.
Fuck you doing?
What's really going on with you and Lisa?
What do you mean?
It's just a lot of weird energy with you guys.
She was...
The protein thing, she was upset.
Yeah.

We sorted... we sorted it out, yeah.
No, no, this is...

Like, I'm not fucking blind, dude.

Just...
But don't lie to me.
You should ask her.
I'm asking you, man to man.

I didn't know about you guys.
Did you fuck her?
We were both shit-faced.
It was a... it was...

One-time thing.
The minute that I knew she was yours,
I fucking killed that shit.
And I feel...

Yeah, don't.
No.

I-I just would never have...

- You know what I mean?

How would you know?

- Fucking mistake, though.

- It was a fucking mistake.

We're good.
- We're good.

Yeah, dude.
Fucking...
Dude...
I just wouldn't let Alvey know just 'cause of the baby, man.
- They've been through a lot.

I-I-I know.

Oh, you do know about that?
Yeah.
But you didn't hear about me and Lisa?
No.
No.

All right, man.
Drive safe, brother.
What'd you have in mind for tonight, baby?
Everything.
Oh, good.
I charge a grand for that.
No, you don't.
How much do you have?
- Me?

I have $400 right here, cash.
The agency takes $300, baby.
- I'm not fucking for $100.

- Mm.

There's an ATM down the street.
- An ATM?

Oh, fuck, man.
I want to.
- You do?

I do.
All right, $600 for an hour.
And I'll buy a bottle of wine.
- Red...

Red or white?
Champagne, but only because I like you.
Oh!

Wake the fuck up, man.
My bad.
It's all right.
All you.
Uh, Comanche and Magnums.
Yo, hey.

Where's the champagne?
Ah, they didn't have any.
Oh.
You doing okay, baby?
- Yeah, I'm good.

- You?

- You in a hurry?

Are we following these people?
What did you say your name was again, sweetheart?
- Rachel.

Rachel, sweetheart, listen...

You're officially on the clock.

Why the fuck are we following these people?
I want you to do me a favor... find a station that you like and don't talk.
Is that her family?
Hey.
Hi, this is Christina...
Fuck.
What the fuck am I doin'?
Is there somewhere I could take you?
Um, maybe we should...
Let's just go back to the hotel.
I left my phone in the car.
I'm just gonna go get it.
Come on.
Aren't you gonna go say something?
