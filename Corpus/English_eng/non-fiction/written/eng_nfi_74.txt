This is a big day.
My boss, Howard Mankiewicz, was in Atlanta for a deposition.
He decided to drop in for 24 hours and check in on his protégé.
That's me.
Obviously, it is very important that my team brings their A-game.
Hey, Dwayne, I'm gonna need an evidence binder for Howard.
Copy that.
Are you kidding me?
You are not wearing a T-shirt that says "Guilty."
Yeah, I didn't think so, either, but this is how it's spelled.
My nephew's school is selling these to raise money for a camping trip.
What other sizes do you have?
All we got left are smalls.
How is that a small?
Well, sizes run big in East Peck.
I'm wearing an 18-to-24 months.
Even got room for a diaper.
Dwayne, put something over that.
Copy that.
Back in New York, Howard knew me as an associate, but here, I'm running the show.
Joshua!
Howard!
Thank you.
Well, you're literally surrounded by dead animals here.
I thought that was a figure of speech.
I want you to meet our team.
This is Dwayne, our lead investigator.
My nephew is raising money for a camping trip.
I'm guessing you are a toddler long.
Nope.
And this is Anne, our researcher.
It's very nice to meet you.
She can't recognize faces.
I can recognize penises, though.
So, it's either a name tag or take off your pants.
No, no.
Nope.
Honestly, that could've gone much worse.
For one thing, pants stayed on.
For another...
Yeah, that's all I got.
So, let's have a closer look at this little case of yours, shall we?
Anyway, we do have a lot of suspects.
Number one, Rutger Hiss, the lead detective, who we discovered was having a relationship with Margaret.
We don't know if it was good.
But, yes, apparently there was some boning.
Number two, Margaret's brother, Jeremiah.
He may have killed her because she discovered that he stole half of the family business.
And, finally, Jeremiah's wife, Josie, our third suspect, who's secretly in love with Larry, but who, according to her Facebook page, is somewhere in the Mediterranean with all of Jeremiah's money and a boy named Stavros.
Well, considering everything you're up against,
I think you're doing a great job.
"A great job."
I'm not gonna lie, that is the best thing I have ever heard in my life.
And I was engaged.
I actually think we're in pretty great shape.
So, tell me, how did you rule out the cable guy?
How'd I rule out the who now?
The cable guy.
_
_
I was waiting for the cable guy to show.
As soon as I heard Larry's voice on the 911 call, he was the first suspect who came to my mind.
Obviously, you must have ruled him out, because I don't see his picture up here anywhere on this board.
Obviously.
We're awaiting word from WPFK field correspondent Eunger Chapman, who's standing by outside The Salty Pecker, where daughter of murderer Larry Henderson has been spotted eating with none other than prosecutor Carol Anne Keane.
Here they come now.
Ms. Henderson, is it true you'll be sitting behind the prosecution's side at the trial?
I haven't decided anything yet.
What an inappropriate question.
And she refuses to comment on whether she'll be sitting on the side of justice or on the side of the man who brutally murdered her stepmommy.
The loss of Summer, in a word... devastating.
In three words... utterly [bleep] devastating.
Well, normally, if someone hurt me, my dad and I would have a spa day and we'd talk about it.
But... since he's the one that hurt me and he has the spa membership, I am making new friends.
Let me try.
All right.
Hey, now!
Dating East Peck men's really strengthened my shooting arm.
You know, you and I have a lot more in common that I realized.
Oh, how is that exactly?
Well, you know, the truth is,
I had a pretty bad relationship with my father.
Really?
East Peck trifecta.
Well, my dad doesn't drink, but... he lies.
How do you trust someone like that?
Oh, honey, you don't.
No, cutting my dad out of my life was one of the best things I ever did.
I mean, yeah, a week ago, if you would've told me
I'd be out shooting guns with Carol Anne Keane,
I would've said you were nuts.
But, the dad thing, she gets it.
And she's actually really sweet.
Little guy was a fighter.
We'd like to talk to the technician who was dispatched to Mr. Henderson's house the night of March 1st.
We were expecting you months ago.
It was a small oversight.
We even sent a bunch of letters.
We get so much hate mail, I stopped opening up everything.
We're here now.
Can you please just tell us the name of the technician who was on call that night so that we can check this box and move on?
His name is Roger Bentman.
Roger Bentman.
Roger Bentman.
Roger Bentman.
Roger Bentman.
That sounds familiar.
Anyway, I need to ask him a couple of questions and confirm he wasn't at the Henderson house that night.
Well, he doesn't work here anymore.
We haven't seen him for months.
But he was at the house that night.
Says here he got there at 5:50 p.m.
How did I miss this?
Well, this is the last of the hate mail.
So Roger Bentman stopped showing up for work the day after Margaret was killed.
He has two prior arrests and no known address.
How do we find him?
Somehow, this hate mail found its way here, and all the envelope says is,
"To that Larry guy what killed the girl."
Hey, that's my brother-cousin's writin'.
Guys, we need to track Bentman down.
Dwayne, do you know anybody at the police department who can help?
Well, if the guy's done some time,
I've got a secret informant on the inside.
His name is Kirby George.
Well, that's no longer a secret, but... sure.
In the meantime, oh, God, I'm gonna have to figure out how to spin this to Mankiewicz.
Sometimes, when my boss is mad at me,
I just pretend to take a phone call.
Wait, have you been doing that to me?
Hello?
I just had a steak for $3.99.
I would've told you to go to dollar days at Steak and Save.
Howard, can we talk in my office?
Are you ready to tell me that you never followed up with the cable guy?
Josh, it's for you.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
I stand before you today to paint a gruesome portrait of a man whose life was built on lies, blood, broken glass, murdered wives.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And then I point to you.
This doesn't feel right.
Well... you know, a lot of things don't feel right that you get used to.
Like bras.
Or a guy sticking his tongue in your ear.
Right?
He calls me twice a year to ask for money like clockwork.
I don't want you seeing me acting unladylike.
But, remember...
Okay?
Is she gone?
How did you find me?
I follow Carol Anne Keane on Instagram.
She posted a picture of you two here, #Besties, along with a very gruesome picture of a dead squirrel.
I gave it a courtesy like.
I don't want to talk to you, Dad.
Or should I say...
No, I guess it's still Dad.
I'm sorry I lied to you, but I didn't want you to know I'd had an affair.
You also told me I was two years younger than I really am!
Well, you've never lied?
Those three beers I found in your trunk after graduation really belonged to your friend Theresa?
Well, it turns out I was actually 21, so I guess it doesn't matter!
Oh, you are such a hypocrite!
All these years, you asked me about your birth parents.
I finally tell you, and you completely flip out on me!
Of course you will.
What do you say you come over for dinner?
I could use a guy's night.
I'll make Eggplant Parmigiana, and I still have "Notting Hill" on that disc from Netflix.
Joshua, quick sidebar.
30,000-foot view of this thing... you are blurring the line between lawyer and friend.
Oh, I don't see that.
Look, a lawyer has to keep a certain professional distance.
You don't want your judgement being clouded by emotion.
Trust me, we have a very professional relationship.
It might run late tonight, so bring pajamas.
You can leave them in your drawer.
Ooh, and by the way, I gave you a drawer.
Okay, yeah, now I see what you were talking about.
The trail to find Roger Bentman has gone cold.
Fortunately, he did some time at the Peck County Jail, where I've made contact with my secret informant, Kirby George.
That's Kirby with a "K."
Hopefully, Kirby will help us find some clues as to Roger Bentman's whereabouts.
Unfortunately, in order to get my informant to talk,
I'm gonna have to smuggle in some contraband.
I need information on Roger Bentman.
I know he did some time here.
What do you mean, pass?
I'm no dummy.
I put 100 aspirin in a condom and I swallowed it.
Anne taught me how to choke down whole grapes to get used to the size.
We're allowed to have aspirin here.
Seriously?
Or you could've just handed it to me $5 so I could go buy it at the canteen.
Dwayne, give him the $5.00.
Well, if he doesn't want the aspirin, he's really not gonna want the $5.
Don't tell me they allow combs in here, too.
What do you know about Roger Bentman?
I remember one thing.
He was big into pigeons.
Dwayne, that's our clue.
Oh, man.
I'm packed like a sardine can up in here!
Mankiewicz has a point.
A little distance from my client might be healthy.
At the end of the day, Larry's an adult.
Thankfully, this is the end of the day.
Listen, I've got to cancel tonight.
Josh?
Boobie?
Well, that's fine.
Mankiewicz is his boss.
And I'm just... me.
That's gonna look bad, isn't it?
Larry?
Larry?
I'm in here.
You sent me an urgent text saying you had new evidence.
What's going on?
Everyone I care about is leaving me.
I'm working very hard on your case.
Do you remember the name Roger Bentman?
Bentman.
You were fixated on his name a month ago, and I figured out why.
Do you remember the cable guy who never showed up?
That's Roger Bentman.
And it turns out he did show up... 10 minutes before Margaret was murdered!
Oh, my God!
And you're just putting this together now?
It slipped through the cracks, okay?
Well, I have a pocketful of evidence for that guy!
Larry, you should be happy.
He's really helping me on your case.
What happened to the kitchen window?
Cheese.
I'm here with Assistant District Attorney Carol Anne Keane and gal pal Summer Henderson.
I wouldn't say "gal pal."
Oh, we have a caller.
Defense attorney Josh Segal.
Welcome to the show, Josh.
Thank you for taking my call, Heidi.
Producers, can you put that down, please?
I just want to say, Heidi, that I am well aware that Summer's father hurt her, but Ms. Keane doesn't care about that.
She's playing you, Summer.
Mr. Segal has no idea of our bond.
He has never worn a bra.
Also, he has no idea what it's like to have a father you can't trust.
She has no relationship with her dad.
I think we've heard enough.
Coming up, we'll continue to speculate
Okay, well, we got a couple new leads on Roger Bentman.
Anne and Dwayne found something out from their informant.
Roger Bentman is a giant pigeon guy.
He raises pigeons, and there is a huge pigeon coop on the roof of the East Peck florist.
I know about that because I parked there last week, and wow, my car got destroyed.
I love these small-town cases.
It's like doing the crossword puzzle in the TV Guide.
Okay, we're gonna head to the pigeon coop.
But first, I'm gonna go call Larry.
Boobie.
I know, but I'm concerned about him.
He had a really rough night last night.
He was... drinking and he was pulling middle fingers out of his pocket.
I'm a good lawyer.
And when this thing is all over, you're gonna be a great lawyer, whether you win or lose.
That's why I let you stay down here.
But in the event you should happen to lose, best to do it in a place like this, in the middle of nowhere, where nobody important's gonna care.
I mean, the death penalty here is carried out by a bear.
That's why we don't get emotionally involved.
You're gonna figure it all out.
Real pleasure meeting you all.
Take care.
Nice guy.
Big comb.
As good as it was having Mankiewicz here,
I'm relieved he's going back to New York.
Sure, he helped lead us to Bentman, but it's not like
I wouldn't have figured that out eventually.
Besides, this is my case.
I need to be in the driver's seat.
Like, literally, because I'm driving him to the airport.
But when I get back, this case... all mine.
Josh?
Josh?
Bentman.
Pigeons?
Florist?
Bentman.
Hey, you guys.
Here you go, guys.
A little din-din.
Bentman.
Larry Henderson.
Well, it took you long enough.
I figured someone from your team would've tracked me down months ago.
You were at my house that night.
Okay, look, I know what you're thinking.
Well, let's hope Bentman's here.
Tell me what you saw that night!
Start talking!
Aaah!
Aaah!
There he is.
Oh, Larry.
Aah!
So with Roger Bentman dead we lost access to the only person who possibly knew what happened at the Henderson house the night of the murder.
The good news is, we had our film crew there, which proves that Larry was not directly responsible for turning Roger Bentman into a stain on the sidewalk.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Bentman family, and we are...
C-Can we send them something?
His head was on backwards.
Dwayne, can you handle that?
I think that aspirin balloon's making a run for it.
I'm gonna send them a Danish.
My life is so full of holes.
I have the Margaret hole, the cheese hole, and the hole that Summer has left in my heart.
Oh, Larry, as much as I wish I could fill all your holes...
I will do whatever I can to help you win this case.
Oh, I know you will, Josh.
But how am I gonna live my life after all this is over?
You know, the good news is, it's a very small town.
Worst-case scenario, you start over someplace else where no one's heard the name Larry Henderson.
Get ready to hear the name Larry Henderson a lot.
The rollercising poetry professor is the defendant in a small-town murder trial involving a bludgeoned wife, a cop in a coma, a severed arm, and now, a cable repairman who plunged to his death.
You might remember the tiny town of East Peck, South Carolina, form a 2005 E. coli outbreak that started in a local restaurant called Steak and Save.
_
Wow.
All these people are here just for a trial date setting?
We made national news.
It's only gonna get worse after the trial starts.
But we got this.
Have you seen Summer?
Uh, not yet.
But, you know, there's a lot of people.
That is the real East Peck trifecta.
Oh, there she is.
[Bleep]
I found this outside my door this morning.
It's a picture of Carol Anne Keane and the horrible father that she hates at a father-daughter dance in Raleigh, North Carolina... last week.
I went from being so angry that she lied to me to... actually being jealous that she had this great relationship with her dad.
And then someone reminded me... so do I.
That was me.
Thank you.
Hi, I'm Anne.
Yeah.
I know.
Mankiewicz definitely has more experience trying murders, but no one has more experience with Larry Henderson than I do.
And that's why I'm the right guy to win this case.
You're a good lawyer.
Thanks, Larry.
And a great friend.
I'm a great friend.
Howard, what are you doing back here?
This case has just gone national.
