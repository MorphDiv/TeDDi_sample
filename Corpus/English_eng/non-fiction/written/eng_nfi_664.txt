- Having you call Gwen Kopechne was... was so wrong.
We should've had Ethel do it.
- The press will wait for an official autopsy report.

And then we're left doing damage control.
- The point is we need to get ahead of the report.
- The point is there can't be an autopsy.
- Well, how do you figure on stopping it?
- We can't.

- I wanna be alone.
- Those guys are trying to save your ass.
- I didn't ask them to.

We're talking legacy, Teddy...

I'm sick of it!

I can't win!

You're running against yourself.

You have to.
If not for yourself, for your parents, for Joan and the kids, for the millions of people that hear the name Kennedy and still hope the world can be better than it is!

Only you can take charge of it.
- A direct pay-off's out of the question.
- I'm not suggesting that.

Is there anything about their little girl that the Kopechnes wouldn't want the world to know?

- If we're not subtle about...

Mary Jo is dead and I'm responsible.
- What Teddy means...

I'm gonna go on TV, tell the truth so far as I know it.
- Admitting guilt on television would mean the end of everything and what would that prove?
- That I have some kind of conscience!

- You wanna make it look like she deserved it?
- No, I...
- Maybe I could do more outside of office.
Can I get a cigarette?
- Teddy, a private man with a conscience can be good.
But a public man with a conscience can be great.
- We'll endure this, Teddy.
We've endured so much already.
This is just another test.

The Kopechnes have to realize that we are in this together, how much we have in common.
- We understand loss.
- We're gonna need more than that.
- We're good people.
Good Catholic people.
- May we come in?
- Certainly, Father.
My daughter was a sweet girl.
- A good girl.
- We want answers, Father.

- As human beings, we always want answers, but what we need is closure.
Only then can we heal.
That process begins with a Mass of Christian Burial.
And the sooner...

That's why we want the autopsy.

- No, I think that they're hiding things.
The Kennedys.

- In your grief, it may seem that way.
But isn't the important thing how we can best serve Mary Jo?
- She was...
She loved children.
She taught at the Mission of St. Jude.
- God has sent you a cross no parent should have to carry, but He's also given you the gift of faith.
Your healing, and Mary Jo's everlasting life, can only begin when her soul is returned to God.
- Good afternoon.
Mary Jo was a wonderful young woman and a loyal friend to the Kennedys.
We ask that you allow us this time to grieve with her family and all of those who knew Mary Jo.
Thank you very much.

- Have you made any financial settlement with the girl's family?
- Think the girl's death will affect your chances at being the president?
- Who said that?
- I did.
- You look pale.
I know this hasn't been easy for you.
Maybe we could... stay up here for the summer, away from the press.
Take some time.
- Together?

There are just a few loose ends in the Senate, trade bills pending, minimum wage.
And when the baby's born, we can go back to Washington.
By then, this will all have blown over.
- Blown over?
- That's not what I meant by that.
- It's gonna come around.
What happened.
To us.
This time, it's gonna come around.
- Senator!

Senator!
- Joansie?

Something's wrong.
- I'm sorry, Senator.
- Joan.
- I thought you were taking the kids to Greece.
- I was on my way when Ethel called.
- You changed your plans just for me?
- Of course.
I'm sorry I told you to go to that service.
I feel horrible.
How are the children?
- They were looking forward to having a... a little sister or brother.
- You're a good mother.
It's not your fault.
It's gonna be okay.
- They're saying it's the Kennedy curse.
First Jack, then Bobby, then... everything.
Who knows, maybe they're right.
- There's no curse, Ted.
It's not about Jack or Bobby.
Don't use them.
It's you.
You used to take some responsibility.
"" I can't be a Kennedy anymore.
"That's something I never thought would happen."
"" Our wonderful times together
"have made me what I am."
"Our sad times, too."
"I pray that you and Joan"
"will find happiness,"
"in your marriage"
"and with your children."
Oh, John...
Is it that one?

I need the rear engine housing.
We're never gonna get this done.
the mom, the dad, and the baby.

- But I don't have a dad anymore.
- You what?

- I don't think that's true.
You know, just because you can't see him, that doesn't mean his love is not all around you, and you're gonna feel him right here.

Do you believe that?
I wanna ask you one question.
'Cause I hear you had a little trouble, maybe?

Why d'you hit that other boy?
You don't know?
Okay.
Have you spoken to the headmaster?
- I don't think it's wise to make excuses for him, because that won't help him in the long run.
- He's really putting up with a lot there, and they're going at him about Jack, pretending to shoot him in the back of the head...
Kids can be really cruel.
But I see your point.

I hate to say it, but it's only gonna get harder when he gets older.
- That's what scares me.
I just want him to have a normal life.
I think we're gonna be spending most of our time in Europe from now on, to get away from all of this.
- He's come a long way, though, Jackie.
A really long way.
He's a strong little boy.
He is.

- He's his father's son.
- He's his mother's son.
- Are you saying I'm rebellious, Father?
- I might be, Jackie.
- J'aime celui-là.
Merci.
- Right now I have to dance with this beautiful lady.
Like an angel and a goddess in one.
- Happy New Year.

- Phone for you, Papa.

- Now, I told the operator not to put through any calls, so...
I know that she didn't call me.

- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I won't have you disrespecting Jackie!

- Then get out!

Ari, this is your house.
Your daughter's always welcome.

- Never a dull moment when you're an Onassis.

I'm not cut out to live my father's life.
I don't want to be the heir apparent.
- Then you shouldn't.
- Tell that to him.
- I think you're strong enough to tell him yourself.
- Maybe one day.
- You're a wonderful son.
Happy New Year.

- Happy New Year.

- There are so many rooms in this house, Jackie, but this one is nothing.
- Then why is it locked?

- It's my home, too.
Come on, Ari.
You're very stubborn.
This is sick.
How could you?
- This is where I come to...

- You turn me into a thing?

Not a thing.
Never.
You're a prize.
- I'm nobody's prize.
I'm your wife.
I'm a human being.
- But I want to worship you.
- I wanna be loved.
- I do love you.
Jackie...

I thought you of all people would understand.
- Please.
- I don't know what to say.

It's fine.
There.

There.
I love you.
- Then this doesn't exist.
- Ow!
- Alright, kids, give him some room.

Come on, Ted, you're never gonna make the pros that way.
What happened?

Okay, let's walk it off.
- I can't.

Let's just pull this up and see what we're dealing with here.
- Chondrosarcoma.
It's a particularly aggressive form of bone cancer.
I triple-checked the results of the biopsy.
His leg will have to be amputated just above the knee to prevent further spread.
- Joansie...
- This is what I meant when I said it would all come around.
- Joansie.
- And you'll just go on, because nothing ever happens to you!
Because you have no sense of remorse!
- Come here.

- Come here.

- I wish I had died instead of the baby.
I wish I was the one with cancer.
This is all my fault and I know it.
- Alexandros Onassis, the only son of Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, died today in a hospital in Athens.

He died of injuries suffered in a plane crash yesterday.
- Ari... it's me.
- I know who you are.
You are Death.
- Don't say that.

You killed my son.
You are cursed.
Everything you touch... turns to death.
I never want to see you again.
- She would've been seven next week.
My niece.
- We'll... pray for you.
- How's your son?
Word gets around.

- We've been praying for you as well.
- I'm... sure they did all they could.
- No!
They could've done more, they might have saved her.
My brother sold his house.
I loaned them all I could.
- She died over... over money?
- Welcome to the real world, Mr. Kennedy.
- I'm kinda hungry.
- Cheeseburger?
- And a shake.
- Teddy?
- Hey, Pop?
- A little girl died.
Because her parents couldn't afford the proper care to save her life.
- Teddy, what are you talking about?
- My mother said...
God saved me for a purpose.
I think I know now what that purpose is.
- In the Senate today,
Senator Edward Kennedy introduced the most comprehensive health care bill in American history.

Joansie, look at him!
He can do it!
- Were you peeking?

- Hmm!

- Do you like it?

Can I take it out?

- Thank you.
Thanks, Mom.
- Hello?
What?
- Papa!
Papa...
- Jackie?
- My love... it's me.
- Jackie.
- I wanted to thank you.
Do you know that you rescued me?
You rescued me when... my life was in shadows.
And you brought me so much love.
And happiness.
Ari,
I will always love you.
- You've always had good timing, I'll grant you that.
He died before the divorce could go through.
- What do you want?
- To find out what you want.

To sever old ties, to have no claims to my father's estate for you and your children.
I'm prepared to bleed a little.
Fifteen million?
Twenty?
I'll go to twenty-five if it means I never have to see you again.
- I know you don't believe it, but I loved him.
- Name your price.
- I never discussed money with him, and I won't with you.
- Someone better, because if you leave it to the courts, you'll get nowhere near what I'm willing to give.
- What you're willing to give is nothing compared to what I've had to take.
Now,
I'd like to be alone.
- Thank you for coming, and welcome to Viking.
In the Russian Style is the glorious result of Jacqueline's efforts.

As our Russian friends would say, spasiba.
Our team is much stronger with you on it.
- You have to have discipline.
D, F, F, F, D, F.
- Honestly, Mom, I don't wanna talk about this right now.

- We're going to talk about this.
You ditched school twice last week.

- Come on, Mom.

And your father didn't either.
- Yeah, well,
I ditched the agents too.

They were looking for me in Columbus Circle while I was in Times Square.

They knew exactly where you were.
It's time for you to start growing up.
It's not about what you can get away with, it's about who you wanna be.
- Whatever.
- Stop lying to your mother!
- I'm sorry.
I know I'm disappointing her.
- Yeah, you are.

The first Kennedy to get bounced.
- Ha!

Harvard, sophomore year.
I paid a friend to take a Spanish test for me.
Boy, was my dad pissed.
Not because I cheated, but because I got caught.
It was a failure, a failure for all of the world to see.
And in this family, they do not tolerate failure.
- It's... lovely.
Now, I remember when Joe was ambassador to England, he and I visited the palace in St. Petersburg.
I miss him.
What's your secret, dear?
To moving on so successfully.
- I don't know.
I guess it's the same thing as you.
I do it all for the children.
- I can't wait to see how my grandchildren will continue what my husband started.
- Dad sat me down and he said: "Teddy",
"you can either have a serious life,
"or a non-serious one.
"I'll love you either way.
"But if you're not serious,
I won't have much time for you."
Your dad,
Bobby, now they lived serious lives.
- Dad wasn't all serious, if what I read is true.
- He wasn't perfect.
Neither of them was.
They were men, and men make mistakes.
But there's no shame in that.
The shame is in not learning from them.
And by the end of his life, your father was a much better man because of your mother than he ever had been before.
Now do something about those grades, or I'll poke your eyes out.
- Come on, Joanie, we're going out on the boat!
Get the lead out!
Go on outside for a minute.

You gotta stop it.
It's ugly and it's weak.
What's going on here?

It's the family.
- The family.
- You have a job to do, Joan, and that's to be a Kennedy wife and raise Kennedy children.
That's what you signed on for.

So do your job, kiddo.
- I don't have the strength.
Mommy!

- Hold on a second, kids.

God will give it to you.
All right, let's go.

- Already discussed it...

- How dare you be associated with this?
Did you read the Times' book review?
"There's one word for this book, and the word is trash, and anyone associated with this publication should be ashamed of herself."
Herself!

A plot to assassinate Teddy after he's been elected president?
And they think it was my idea.
You said you would never publish this.
- I told you about this project as a courtesy, and at the time you raised no objections.
- We never discussed it.
I would've insisted it not be published, you know that.
- That is not your call to make.

- Withdraw the commitment.

- This is a filthy, cheap, disgusting exploitation...

- We're not a franchise, we're a family.
- Not anymore.
- Tom, come on.
I've attracted authors who never would've come to Viking.
- And you became the darling of the publishing world and you love it.
- So do you.

Recall this obscenity, or I'll leave.
- The choice is entirely yours.
- Yeah, but was it really worth quitting over some stupid book about me?
- Of course.

- I guess the trick to being in this family is... not being squashed by it.
- Yes.
That is the trick.
- Good night, Jacks.

What's going on?
What's going on?

Where is he?
- He took off into the park on his bike and we lost him.
- Where is my son?
- You know what kind of lunatics are out there?

People who are after him just because of who he is!
- Ma'am, we have agents and police officers all over the park.

He has been gone for two hours!

What are you DOING?

- I'm OK, Mom.
- They found him leaving the east meadow without his bike.
- Some guy jumped out of the bushes and hit me with a stick.
He took it.
- There are a lot of addicts in the area.
Probably trying to turn the bike into cash.
- I'm warning you, Mr. Price.
If anything happens to my children,
I won't be as easy on the Secret Service as I was in Dallas.
- I can always get another bike.

Or worse!

- I CAN'T TAKE IT, JOHN!

I want Jack... remembered the way I knew him.
- Could we start with Texas?
- Sure.
It was the biggest motorcade from the airport.
And it was hot.
And they were gunning the motorcycles and there were these backfires and I heard this noise and I thought it was a backfire...
Then one of the men grabbed Jack's arms, and and said, "NO!

I saw a piece of his skull coming off of his head.
And all the way to the hospital,
I tried to hold the top of his head down.
Maybe...
I could keep it in.
But when I got to the hospital, they made me wait in this hallway.
And I just kept thinking, "Well, maybe,"
"maybe he'll live"
"and everything will be OK"
" and our country will be OK and our family will be OK."
- With the memory of gas rationing still fresh in the minds of voters, with interest rates soaring above 20% and with the recent hostage taking of U.S. embassy workers by Iranian terrorists in Tehran,
President Carter's approval rating has fallen to a new low, leading to speculation that he may be challenged by fellow Democrats prior to next year's election.
- Typical Boston spring.
It's cold and wet.
you could come down next week.

- You know I have my AA meetings.
I go twice a day.
it'd be nice to see you.
- How about Thursday?

- If this is gonna work, then Joan's gotta stay sober.
Simple as that.

- Sobriety is one thing, but Ted and Joan have been separated for almost...
- Not legally.

You can't run for president unless she's at your side.
- Heya, doll!

- I thought we were having lunch.
- You look great!
Have a seat.
There you go.
- What is this?
- I'm going for the nomination.
You hear people talking.

But I need your help.
I can't do this without you.
I want this.
- We'll be back in the White House.
- I've been putting this off since '68.
It's now or never.
- You'd make a great president, Teddy.
But I can't.
I'm sorry.
I need more time to work on myself.
I really do.
- I think we could have made it.
- OK.
- Well, it's great about Teddy, don't you think?
He's gonna beat Carter hands-down.
- Thank you.
That'll be all.
I hear they recruited Joan.

We're all gonna get on board.

It'll be just like the old days.
- Jackie?
You're gonna get on board.
- No.
I don't want him to run.
- The country's going to hell, Jackie.
Jack had his time.
Bobby...
Bobby never got his chance.
But Teddy can take back what's ours.
- Nothing will ever bring back what we lost.
- He's our last hope.
And there's a lot more at stake here than what you want.
- There is a lot at stake.

Joan.

- Joan can't handle this right now.
- Jackie, are you with us or not?
- Ethel...
Ethel, you don't have to leave like this.
Yeah, smile for us!
- It's horrible!

Ethel said you won't help us.
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- How would you put it?
- Are you sure it's the right thing?
- He may never get another chance.

- You don't think I can handle it.
- I didn't say that.

You know what it means to be important to your husband.
I've never had that.
I want it.
I want to feel valued...
I understand.
But do you want to be a wife, or a widow?
- Don't you think I've thought about it?
- I've lived it.
And there's a hole in my heart that... will never be filled.
And in the hearts of my children.
I couldn't bear to see that happening to you.
- I still love him.
In spite of all...

His love or his life?
- Alright, Ted.

inflation, interest rates, increase the amount of global prestige...
That's it.

Kennedy!

Kennedy!

Kennedy!

Kennedy!

Kennedy!

Kennedy!

- Right here, right here Sir!

- Senator, my question's for Mrs. Kennedy.
Do you believe your husband's story about Chappaquiddick?
Yes,
I believe my husband's story, which he told to me right after, uh, the incident.
And it seems to me that, uh,
I've heard, um, my husband's story, and various versions of his story by other people for a decade.
A long time.
And I don't believe anything new is going to come out of, you know, all these stories.
Thank you.
- Any more questions?

John, you're not going to law school?

- Stanislavski said, "Uh-uh."
- When did you make that decision?
- About four years ago.
You just never wanted to hear it.
- If that's what you want to do, do it!
But if you're going to be a struggling artist,
I won't pay for it.
- Use my inheritance.
- You don't have access to it for five years.
- Wow, that's great, Mom.

I'm not trying to keep you on a leash.
- You care about appearances.

I want you to do something important with your life!
I want you to do something that would make your father proud...

And wasting my life doing something I hate, will that make him proud?
- Don't walk away...
Senator Kennedy, why do you want to be President?
- Well, I, um...
I have a great belief in this country, that it is, um...
There are more natural resources than any other nation in the world.
I would, uh... feel that, uh, it's imperative that this country either move forward, otherwise it... uh... moves backward.
That was a disaster!

- The son of a bitch sandbagged me!

You think he would have asked the same question to Jack or Bobby?

They knew why they were running, and they knew it in their bones!
- How do we salvage this?
- CBS did a phone survey right after the broadcast.
70% of respondents found you to be an unacceptable alternative to Carter.
We'll never recover from this.
- Senator Kennedy, a couple of words on the reaction...
- For me, a few hours ago, this campaign came to an end.
For all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on, the cause endures the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die.
Cheers and tears filled Madison Square Garden in New York last night, as Senator Edward Kennedy, the last surviving son of Camelot, saw his presidential aspirations come crashing down.
- Just so you know, I'm quitting the acting thing.
I'm gonna go to law school.
- The primetime TV interview proved to be his downfall, as Senator Kennedy appeared to stumble his way through policy questions...
- I'm glad I was with you.
It'll be nice to be at the Cape.
- I'll see you in a week.

I've filed for divorce.
Teddy never would have done it.
We'd have just gone on, making each other miserable.
I'm sorry.
But I have to take control of my life.
- Teddy has many good qualities.
Of course, I was always old fashioned.
I don't smoke, I don't drink, I just... had lots of children.
And you... are the mother of his.
They need you.
They need you to be sound and healthy.
You're doing the only thing you can.
You...
You'll be in my prayers.
How do you feel about failing the bar exam for the second time?

I'm, uh, very disappointed.

But, God willing,
I'll pass it the next time, or the time after that, or I'll pass it when I'm 95.
- Have you told your mother?

But fortunately, the line was busy.
- What do you think her reaction will be?
- My mother has a great capacity for handling the good and the bad, and given all the bad that she's seen, this isn't so bad.
I embarrassed you, the family...
I know how much you want this.
- You didn't embarrass me.
I saw you on the news.
And you didn't let them see how much it hurt.
That took courage and strength.
You are so much like your father.
He'd be proud of you.
You can take it again next year.
- Yeah.
- How are the children doing?
- Caroline's my little helper.
But John John will belong to the men now.
I want him to grow up to be a good boy.
I have no better dream for him.
Maybe...
I don't know...

We've traveled a long road.
N'est-Ce pas?
- Absolument.
You've been an excellent mother.
And I always admired how you triumphed over the adversities.
- They've asked John to speak at the convention.
- It's a great honour.
Why are you not happy about it?
- I'm afraid that they'll push John like they pushed Jack.
- Jack grew to love it.
And John... will be remarkable.
It's in the blood.

Thank you very much!
Go, John!
- Over a quarter-century ago, my father stood before you to accept the nomination for the presidency of the United States.
Thank you.
So many of you came into public service because of him.
In a very real sense, because of you, he is with us still.
- Kennedy!

- For that,
I am grateful to all of you.
I owe a special debt to the man his nieces and nephews call Teddy.
He has shown that an unwavering commitment to the poor, to the elderly, to those without hope is the greatest reward for public service.
Woohoo!
- He has shown that our hope is not lost idealism, but a realistic possibility.
Thank you.

Kennedy!

Kennedy!

- Thank you.
- What do I say to him?
You saw his face light up.
What if he wants to follow after Jack?
- I'm the last one to ask.
I had it right in my hands.
- The best thing that ever happened to you was not being president.
- It was there for the taking!
- You didn't want it.
You know in your heart you didn't.
- The hell with it.
Maybe I should just call it a day.
Retire.
You know what they're saying about me on the floor?
That I'm an impediment to the passage of legislation.
Me!
That I'm an embarrassment to the party.
- Forget legislation.

Look what it's doing to you!
Get rid of it.
Pour it down the drain.

- That's what I used to say to Joan.
- Ted.
You've been in the Senate for 30 years.
You could be here another 30.
You can help more people than Jack or Bobby ever did.
Whatever you accomplish won't mean anything if you're not the best man you can be.
The best father you can be.
And right now,
Teddy, you're not.
And in your heart, you know that.
- I am painfully aware that the criticisms directed at me involve far more than just honest disagreements with my political position.
It also involves the disappointment of my friends and members of my own family.
To them, I say,
I recognize my shortcomings, the faults in the conduct of my private life, and I realize that I alone am responsible for them, and I am the one who must confront them.
Hi.

It was a good speech.
- Well, it was meant for you.
Of all the people I've hurt in my life,
I've hurt you the most.
And I'm...
I'm ashamed by that.
- I used to blame you.
You were my excuse for drinking.
For everything.
But it was really me.
Once I realized that...
I'll be alright.
I hope you will be too.
- Can I buy you a cup of coffee sometime?
- I don't think so.
Let the word go forth from this time and place to friend and foe alike that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans, born of this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace proud of our ancient heritage
and unwilling to witness or permit a slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed and to which we are committed today.
At home and around the world.
- I'm so ashamed of myself.
Jack... everything he ever quoted was Greek or Roman, and the only thing that's running through my head right now is a song from a Broadway musical.
At night, we listened to songs on this, this scratchy old Victrola.
He loved this song called Camelot.
"Don't let it be forgotten..."
"...that once, there was a spot..."
"...for one brief, shining moment..."
" ...that was known as Camelot."
I thought the pain was just an ulcer.
- But it's not.
You wouldn't have called me otherwise.
- Oh, Teddy.
It's non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
- Jackie.
- I'm only telling you.
- But the kids...
You need to tell them.
- I know.
Not now.
I'll tell them when I have to.
I feel like I failed them.
But you've always been good at toeing the party line.
And the party line is...
Paris in the spring.
Can you do that?
- You're too young, Jacks.
- Don't feel sorry for me.
I've had the most wonderful life.
- I feel sorry for me.
I feel sorry for all of us.
- You need to be strong.
- I get my strength from you.
- And now's your chance to prove it.
If anyone asks how I'm doing...
- "Paris in the spring."
- Yes, that's it.

that was known as Camelot."
- And it will never be that way again.
- "And it will never be that way again."
That is the whole point of the piece, Al!
They, uh, want to cut the reference to Camelot.
They feel it is overblown and melodramatic.
- It stays, Mr. White.
Or I'll give the exclusive to Newsweek.
- Mrs. Kennedy has just threatened to give the story to Newsweek.
- Mom?
You can't read in your sleep.
- Hi.

- How are you?

I've been thinking...
I might run for Congress.
- Hm?
- People tell me everywhere I go that... that I could do it, I should do it.
- Do you wanna do it?

- Why?
- I'm supposed to.
Aren't I?
I'm his son.
People tell me it was the best time of their lives.

- People say that Camelot was... was so special!
- Honey, I made that up.
I invented it one night on the Cape, about 30 years ago.
For an interview just after he died.
I was in so much grief and I needed a pretty story to wrap it in.
I needed to see it as this magical place.
- You mean none of it was true?
- There were wonderful times.
And it was magical.
It was the way I wanted him to be remembered.
And it worked.
But, sweetheart,
Camelot was my story.
It doesn't have to be yours.
Public career is something to be valued, but only if you value it.
Not because you feel like you owe me or or him... or some ideal that never really existed.
I don't want what happened to Teddy to happen to you.
You have your whole life ahead of you.
Have a family.
It's the most important thing and it's the only thing that lasts.
Will you help me up?
- Sure.
Pretty heavy.
- It's so good.
- Well, you eat as much as you want.
- Ethel.
We've always had our ups and downs.
- The downs were my fault, Jackie.
- I want you to know I admire how true to yourself you are.
You're a wonderful woman.
And you've been a wonderful sister.
Most of the time.
Hmm.

Between us.
- You'll be with God soon.
And with Jack.
- I'll be happy to see him.
She said she's proud of me.
- She'll be with us for the rest of our lives, guiding us and loving us in spite of our flaws.
- You're the only real father I've ever known.
- Whatever I am,
I'm a better man than I used to be.
Because of her.
- I will miss her.
- You have your whole life ahead of you, John.
And it's gonna be great.
- Everything checks out, Mr. Kennedy.
- It's John.
- I, uh, hope you don't mind, but your father was a hero of mine.
Still is.
- Yeah.

- Someday, you're going to put this country on the right road again, just like he would've.
We need you, John.

Have a good flight.
- Thanks.
- What are you thinking about?
- My mother.
My father.

- Is it what you want?
- I think maybe it is.
Would you be with me?
- Yeah.
- I guess we'll never know until we try.
With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on Earth,
God's work must truly be our own.
