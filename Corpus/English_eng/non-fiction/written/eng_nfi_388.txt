Yeah, Metro, be advised,
Rescue 4 was also on scene.
We've got an airship down.
We're gonna get a water supply...
Get a light on him.
Is anybody in there?
- The medic!

Okay, hold on.
- What do you got?

Was being transported with a ruptured appy.
Early sepsis.

Get him moving, ASAP.
Who's this?
- This is the pilot.

Severe facial trauma, bleeding neck lac.
Couldn't intubate, too much blood in her mouth.
This thing is gonna blow!
- All right, open up that nozzle!

As the basketball team's physician,
I deal with all injuries... everything from blisters to broken bones.
- I also manage physical therapy...

Are you not impressed with the skill involved?
Basketball's not really my thing.
- ... as well as nutrition...

I'm there.
Man, you really want this gig, huh?
Are you kidding me?

Plus there's the extra cash.
If you're so interested, you might want to listen.
And if you're among the group of residents chosen to assist me, you will be, too.
Plus, you'll also get one of these super cool jackets.
With "Assistant Team Doctor" right there.
Who's he talkin' to?
The Waverly athletic director.
Is Angus giving him a tour?
How do they know each other?
It's gotta be his dad.

Does anyone have any more questions
- about the program?

- Rorish here.

Look, you're gonna have to cut it short.
I was out on a ride-along...
Another ride-along?

Pot, kettle.

What kind of mess?
Medevac was transporting a patient off a cruise ship.
Chopper went down.

We'll be ready.
Doc, you're good to go.
He's conscious.
Oh!
What's your name?
Brad.

Is my patient alive?
He's on his way back to Angels.
What about my... my pilot...

I don't know how she did it, but she... she saved us.
You're the one I'm worried about right now, okay?
He's wedged in here real good.
We got another flare-up!
What kind of offensive strategy you into?
Motion, triple post?
The one where my team scores.
You really don't know anything about basketball, do you?
We're not gonna be playing for the team if we get the job.
We're doctors.
Pretty sure I can handle that.
Leighton, Savetti, talk sports later, please.
Yep, we need your heads in this game.
These are the first two victims of the medevac crash.
35-year-old male with ruptured appy.
Blunt injury to head, chest, and abdomen.
He's hypotensive and hypoxic.

Could I have my phone?

I left her and my 8-year-old on the cruise ship.
Sir, you can call her as soon as you're stabilized.

40-year-old female.

- Her name's Debbie.

Status post-nasal intubation in the field.
I can see that.
Stats are dropping.

- Let's get her into Center Stage.

- Where's Dr. Willis?

Okay.

Ow!

He's melted to the seat.
Okay, we're gonna cut this seat out.
We're gonna take the whole thing with us.
- All right?

Let's do it.
What's happening?

We're gonna get you out of here.
I'm gonna give you some morphine.
This'll help.
What about Rowan?

His family.

I promised him I'd...

You're gonna keep your promise.
There's fuel leaking out of this thing.
Let's go.
Almost there.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Whoa, whoa!
Okay, lung sounds are clear.
She's getting tough to bag.

Maybe her intratracheal tube's dislodged.
Her jaw is dislocated.
- It's compressing her breathing tube.

Put these on, so she don't bite your thumbs off.
Come on, Debbie.

Sats are down 72%.
Come on, girl.
Ah!
Okay.

Male, 40s, second and third degree burns on his back.
He's fused to the seat.

Alert the burn unit?
We weren't able to separate him from the chair on the scene.
We have to do it surgically.

Let's stabilize him here.
How does trouble always find you?
That's a good question.

She's stable enough to move to OR.
- I'll take her up on my own.

Diffuse tenderness and guarding.
Belly's full of blood.
Let's get him to the OR.

Arms are burnt.

Do an EJ.
We're gonna take care of you, Brad.
- You know him?

These two have been flying people in here for years.
He's having trouble breathing.
Burns are full thickness to his back and right chest, constricting his breathing.
He can't expand his lungs.
- Fasciotomy.

Dr. Kean, we need to cut the chair off of his back and then cut through the burns.
Let's bring him to the OR for that.
Risa, can you page burn unit, please?
- Already on their way.

Behind you.
- Sats are down to 74.

That is not gonna fix this problem.
All right, we gotta get this chair off him now or he's gonna suffocate.
So much for slow and careful.
- What do we got?

She coded in the elevator.
Hamman's crunch.

- We got to open her up now.

Pulse ox is down to 64%.
You guys finish freeing the chair,
I'll incise the chest.
- I need Betadine.

Guys, we gotta work faster.
He's crashing.
Come on, Brad.

- We're almost there.

Sarah, scalpel.
My side, too.

One, two, three.
I'm through the subcu tissue.
Sats are coming up.
Pulse is strong.
He's not out of the woods yet.
Okay, let's dress him and get him up to the burn unit.
Your daughter threw a stapler at my son.
- Is she crazy or something?

Do you know that your son was making fun of my daughter's clothes?
He was being a bully.
Okay.

Your daughter should be in jail.
You need to relax, sir, seriously.
Okay, you need to mind your own business
- and just take care of the cut.

- It's all right, son, I got this.

I mean, my head's pounding, and my eye's gone totally fuzzy.
What's... what do you mean?

Let me take a closer look.
- Does it hurt?

Okay, what's... what's wrong?

It could be nothing, but we need to get a CT.

A C...
- You're gonna pay for that.

- April.

No, no.

Medical bills are expensive.
And I'm gonna sue you for everything.
Dr. Dixon.
- You have this under control?

Okay, okay.

I'm the head of this ER and the chief of surgery.
Hey, buddy.
What does the patient need, Dr. Dixon?
Uh, CT of his brain and orbits.
Make that happen.
- Dr. Rorish.

Debbie didn't make it.
- I'm sorry.

Was the first female chopper pilot I ever met.
I have to go call her parents.
How do you wanna handle Brad?
I'd like to tell him, if you don't mind.
They're like family.
All right Swing it around.
This should help with the pain.
We talked to the surgeons.
The good news is they got your appendix out.
And the bad news?
You had a significant abdominal injury from the crash.
We had to remove several feet of your intestines.
Oh, my God.
We'll monitor you closely, but you should know... there could be other complications.
I can't tell my wife that.
She worries too much.
Rowan.

Are... are you okay?
Yes, honey.

I got my appendix taken out, but I am fine.
Is Jason with you?
Dad, when are you coming back?
Not right now, bud, but... they are taking such good care of me.
Hey, you know how you want to be a doctor?
How 'bout I get one of those fancy stethoscopes for you?
You can do that?
Hey, put Mommy back on.
Hey, how much did you give him?

A milligram of Dilaudid.
IV push?

- He's just out of surgery.

His pressure is fine.
- Yeah, for now.

But he could still have anesthetic in his system.
His D-dimer is elevated.

And you could have disseminated herpes, but I'm guessing that you don't.
What is wrong with you?
How do you know the athletic director at Waverly?
Oh, my God.
It's your dad, right?
I cannot believe this.

I have as much a right to that job as you do.
Everything I have ever gotten in my life,
I've had to fight for.
- You never fought for anything.

Your dad.

And all I've ever had is an out.
Hey.

- No.

Then stop arguing in front of patients.
Actually, stop arguing.

You think I could get one of those stethoscopes?
I'll see what I can do.
One, two, three.
8 to 10-year-old female found alone in a mall.
Severely agitated.
Diffuse wheezing and mild hypoxia.
Her oxygen keeps dropping.
All right, all right, I'll back off.
Uh, any head trauma or fevers?
No.

We should put four point restraints on her.
What the hell's going on?
We're not using four point restraints on a child.
Oxygen's at 86%.
She had anything to eat?

- Any drugs on her?

Hey.

Where are your parents?
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Okay.
We need to put this oxygen mask on you so you can...
I gotta put this mask on you so you can...
She can hear us.

Zoe?

Is she okay?

I can calm her down.

She needs a breathing treatment.
- Maybe you wanna put it on her.

She's autistic.

You just slip it on the back.
I...

Okay, okay.

She's probably got pneumonia.
It'd be the fourth time this year.
She has chronic asthma.
Has she been checked for sickle cell?
Of course.

What's the distance between
Los Angeles and Dallas, Texas?
The distance between
Los Angeles, California, and Dallas, Texas, is...
She talks to the phone.
She also repeats what she hears on TV and sometimes talks to her stuffed animals.
But she never talks to me.
She's 9, and she's never said one word to me.
Not even "Mommy."
1, 2, 3...
Oh, God, no.

Where's the pain?
I don't know.

But if it's radiating or coming in waves or...
I-I don't know.

- ... 10, 11...

- Okay.

Hey, Brad.
How is she doing?
I saw that they got her breathing again.
She's so tough.
- Brad.

She... she wants to get back to work as bad as I do.
Brad.
I'm sorry.
Debbie died in surgery.
In... in my head, everybody lives.
What do you mean?
I mean, I drop them off on your roof,
I fly away, and I don't look back, and in my head... they all live.
What about the patient, the, uh, the appy?
He's stable.
We're doing everything we can.
Can you keep me in the loop?
I promised him he'd see his family again.
I know.
We shouldn't make promises.
No.
But we all do.
Dad, you have to come back.

I know, buddy, but...

I'll be able to listen to your heart when I get there.
You sure can.
I promise.
The CT found some bleeding behind his right eye, which is compressing his optic nerve.
And why are you telling me this?
It's not my eye.
Right.

The guy's tough.
Maybe you should be the one to talk to him.
Dr. Dixon, I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
See, handling patients is part of being a doctor.
So you either do the whole job or you don't do any of it.
Okay.
I'll take that as a no.
Now once the neuro stimulator's implanted, it delivers electrical impulses, targets different areas of the brain to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's.
It's called Deep Brain Stimulation surgery.
It's like a pacemaker for your brain.
Yeah, I've heard of it.
And you've done it before?
Handful of times.
Each with varying degrees of success.
So there's no guarantee it'll work.
Or that I'll even survive the surgery.
There are risks.

You know that.
But you're also a very good candidate, and that's rare.
Not everybody qualifies.
To start with, there's some pre-op lab tests, okay?
We can get those done tonight.
No.
Rollie, it's a short window.
You're a good candidate now, but I can't guarantee that...
- I'm not ready.

No.

Thank you.
I appreciate your time.
- An operation?

- Are you kidding me?

Am I going to be all right?
Quiet.

Well, there is a chance that the damage could be permanent.
What does that mean?
He could lose vision in that eye.
What?
Look, look, we just have to see how he responds.
We have an OR scheduled in two hours.
Okay, two hours is too long.

Hey, listen to me.

Take him... right... now.
Sir, we will take him in two hours.
Now if you don't settle yourself down, you won't be here in two hours because I will call security and have you escorted out.
- Talk to me.

Looks like V-tach.
It's not V-tach.

She needs magnesium.
Slam it.

Okay.
Is she okay now?
Her heart rate became irregular.
So she has a heart problem, too?
How does she eat?
What does that have to do with anything?
Poor nutrition could make her more susceptible to heart arrhythmia.
- And she's really thin.

I want a CAT scan of her abdomen.
No, no, no.

She won't sit still.
We could try conscious sedation, but there are risks, particularly with the irregular heartbeat.
You're just like everyone else.
You're full of crap.
You don't know anything either.
Why couldn't you just do your job and fix her?
1, 2... 3, 4... 5, 6...
I wish you could just tell us where it hurts.
What the temperature in Dallas, Texas?
The temperature in Dallas, Texas, is 38 degrees.
Are you wearing a jacket?
I don't wear jackets.
You... you'll be cold.
She can be pretty chatty when she wants to be.
Are you any good with technology?
I was born in '92.

Good.

It's not slowing down.
Hang two units of cross-matched PRBCs now.
- Yes, Doctor.

He's hemorrhaging everywhere.
Start him on FFP.

He can't clot anymore.
The accident must've sent him into DIC.
Isn't that usually fatal?
Usually, not always.
I told Angus his D-dimer was elevated.
That's a classic finding in a DIC case, right?
What's the status on his wife?
The boat is supposed to dock tomorrow.
He doesn't have until tomorrow.
Someone needs to get up to the helipad.
- See if we have a chopper available.

So that this father can see his family before he dies.
Go.
He probably won't make it for more than a couple of hours.
He should see his family one last time.
And they are on a cruise ship?
200 miles out.
I'd like to send one of our medevac helicopters.
Well, that's an expensive Uber ride, Leanne.
What happens if we need that chopper for patients while it's picking up fares?
Well, I've already thought about that.
There's one on the roof ready to go.
- Oh.

And you want me to pick up the tab?
For one last goodbye?

It's cheap at twice the price.
Sorry, Leanne.

What would you do to see your daughter one last time?
What would that be worth?
My responsibility is this hospital.
The answer is no.
It's good to see you awake.
What's happening to me?
You have a condition known as DIC... disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.
That doesn't sound good.
It means we can't stop your bleeding.
Your body is chewing up all the clotting factors... faster than we give them to you.
Are... are you saying...
I'm dying?
We're doing everything we can, but at this stage, it's rarely reversible.
Well, uh... how... how much... how much time do I have?
Because my wife is gonna come.
She's a day away, and...
You just have to hold on.
Yeah.
Almost done.
Sorry.

What are you doing again?
I'm installing a voice simulator app on Dr. Willis's phone.
When he talks into it, it'll sound like that English woman you chose.
- Here.

Well, she still has to answer the phone.
That part's gonna be up to her.
Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice...
Just keep calling till she answers.
Just like the girls in high school.
Hopefully this will have better results.
Hello.
Hello.
How are you?

Are you okay?
Are you okay?
No.
- What's the matter?

She's actually talking to you.

I feel bad.
Where does it hurt?
What's the weather in Tokyo, Japan?
I'm gonna need the weather in Tokyo, Japan.
Tell her you're searching the web.
Searching the web.
Searching the web.
The weather in Tokyo, Japan, is 32 degrees.
You should put on a jacket.
- I will.

This could take a while.
Rorish has got a line on a chopper, but Campbell said no.
- What the hell was that?

- "His D-dimer was elevated"?

There are a million reasons why his D-dimer could've been elevated.
A cold could've elevated his D-dimer.
And so could a DIC.
Yeah, but you didn't say that then.
Neither one of us was thinking that.
We were thinking it was elevated maybe because of an appendicitis.
You have no idea what I was thinking.
You said that to Rorish to make you look right and me look wrong.
You're acting crazy.
God, why are you so threatened by me?
There's nothing about you that threatens me, Angus.

Okay, knock it off.

Let's go.

Are you kidding me?
Come on.
What happened?
You were getting along so well for so long.
- He just...

This is my house.
I won't have this type of behavior.
You're acting like those chickens.
What chickens?
They separated out the superhero egg-layers from the ones that pinched out one or two.
You know what happened?
No.
When they came back, the average group was all good.
And the superheroes?
They pecked each other to death.
Look, your job around here is hard enough.
You don't have to outshine each other.

Or you're gonna end up a couple of dead chickens.
The neuro-ophthalmologist is very good.

I'll be right outside.
He's all set.
Thank you.
Dad, why are you such a jerk?
I'll see you after.
Am I a jerk?
N... you're, uh... you're loud.
I walk a lot.
A mile.
Every day.
That's a lot of walking.
That's a lot of walking.
Yes.
Except when I don't feel good.
- Like right now.

Yes.
Where does it hurt?
1, 2, 3  4...
Can you tell us where it hurts?
Can you point to it?
Can you tell us where it hurts?
Can you point to it?
She's pointing to her upper abdomen, just left of midline.
It could be her pancreas or spleen or stomach.
Angels, base.

This is Life Bird One on humanitarian mission.
ETA... six minutes.
His pressure's dropping.
Pulse is down to 55.
He can't control the bleeding anymore.
Damn it.
They better hurry.
Pressure's still dropping.

Set another line and bolus some fluids.
Please save my baby.

Could be acute pancreatitis.

I got a crazy idea.
She's in the zero percentile in weight from malabsorption.
Likely pancreatic inflammation and resistant pneumonia.
- What does that add up to?

Exactly.
Except CF's practically nonexistent in African-Americans.
1 in 15,000.
And that's why she's never been tested.
How bad is cystic fibrosis?
Not as bad as not knowing.
It's a simple sweat test.

Start her on the standard CF protocol... chest PT and mucolytics.
No matter what the odds are, somebody's gotta be the one.
Dr. Rorish, his family's here.
Oh, God.

Dad!
Mrs. Davis...
What's happening?
Dr. Leighton, can you take Jason to the vending machine, please?
No.

- Dr. Leighton.

Daddy's still resting, so you go get a snack, okay?
- Okay.

Thank you.
When will he wake up?
We don't know.
Will he wake up?
We don't know.
All we can do right now is... hope and wait.
What do I tell Jason?
He can't live without his dad.
Neither of us can.
Now that's one thing I don't miss about being here.
We could bring people back from the blink of death.
Nobody can make a decent cup of coffee.
How are you, my friend?
I'm better.
Jesse, I-I need to apologize for the position that I put you in.
No, come on.

No, no.

I'm not a doctor anymore, Jesse.
You tried to get me to face it, tried to get me to talk to Campbell.
I just wasn't listening.
Well, I should've tried harder.
I can be very persuasive when I wanna be, and for the record, you're always gonna be a doctor.
No, no.

From what I hear, there's a miracle waiting for you.
The surgery?
Who told you?
Big Brother ain't got nothing on Big Mama.
I got my network of spy nurses all over.
Have you scheduled for it yet?
No, we haven't.
Why not?
Not ready yet.
What do you mean you're not ready?
Rollie, you hit the lottery.
I'm not ready, Jesse.
Why not?
I have some unfinished business.
Don't hit me.
What do you want?
I-I don't know.

I just...
I know.
My dad wanted me to do it.
He's been calling me every day to talk about it.
I guess I just sort of liked the attention.
Mm-hmm.
Probably not gonna last, though.
He's, uh, got that short attention span.
You're the new supply.
When a drug addict loses his dealer, he needs a new supply.
You know, Mike's out of town, now your dad's got you.
Thank you, Mario.

Not saying he doesn't love you.
I'm saying he is who he is.
I don't think you should let him hook you up with anything.
You deserve all the credit for your accomplishments.
Your dad didn't make you a good doctor, Angus.
You did.
Wait.

- No, I said "good."

- I'm really touched you...

It's too late.

- Would you shut up?

What are you doing here?
I invited them here.
Are you okay?
What?

Yeah, it's fixed.
Um, I'm sorry for screaming at you guys.
It's a bad habit of mine, and I need to be a better father than that.
You could've ducked.
You threw it like a million miles an hour.
Can I see your eye?
Sure.
She's killing it.
It's a good sign.

Okay.
We have some answers.
She had bad pancreatic inflammation, but the fluids are doing their thing.
And, um... we were right.
She has CF.
I just can't believe with everything else she deals with, she has this, too.
Why is she so unlucky?
There's a cutting-edge medicine.
A CFTR channel potentiator.
It stops the mucus.
It's effective only in people with a certain mutation, maybe 5% to 6%, but for them it is a game changer.
That doesn't sound like very good odds.
It's not.
But your daughter had a 1 in 68 chance of autism and 1 in 17,000 chance of CF.
Her marker came back positive.
She can take the medicine.
She's one in a million.
Yes, she is.
You know, she scored another jackpot.
She got you as a mom.
What's this for?
Call her.
But I'm gonna sound like the British voice thing?
No, no.

See what happens.
Hello?
Zoe?
How are you?
You don't sound like the phone.
You sound like... my mommy.
I am.
I am your mommy.
I am.

Sasha.
Come with me.
Dad!
Are you...
He's okay.
All of a sudden, his inflammatory reaction slowed down.
It's rare.

Rowan is the luckiest unlucky guy we've ever met.
I just had too much to live for.
Oh, buddy.
Check this out, huh?
Just like I promised.
- How do I sound?

You bet he does.
What the hell did you do?
I went over your very tall head.
No, you wasted our resources.
I don't think it was a waste.
I think it made the difference.
What?
There is no medical reason that man is alive.
But there he is.
You are a better doctor than you know.
Oh, I know exactly how good I am.
But it is a myth that what we do is all science.
That man was about to die.
And then his son... came and touched his hand, and he came back.
Is that your apology?
I'm not sorry.
You'll have to fire me.
Oh, well, maybe I will.
Tomorrow.
I will fire you.
I can't believe you hijacked a helicopter today.
Please.

You came with me, remember?
No.

Don't look now, but you have nervous residents at 2 o'clock.
I guess you two wanna know who I chose for the Waverly University job.
- No.

Good.
'Cause I already made my decision.
