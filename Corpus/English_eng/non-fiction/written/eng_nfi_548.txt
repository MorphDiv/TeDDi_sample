I always thought Spencer was rolling in it.
The car, the house, the clothes.
He went broke for me?
He went broke a while before that, but he gambled his last chips on you.
You said when you took the job that you were doing it to protect players.
I did take this job to protect players.
And because I was fucking broke.
I want you to work for me here, in the front office.
You'll be on the road for the next couple months.
- What's with the scratching?

You got hives.

I'm gonna let you purchase a piece of ASM.
The thing is, I need a loan to do it.
All right.

You sure you're cool with this, Rick?
Yeah, yeah I am.
- Fifty-fifty proposition.

- Thank you.

What's happening?

Come on.

I'm open.
Whoo!
Let's go, Spence.

- Come on!

You're gonna get hurt, Chuck.
That shit did hurt.

That wasn't no foul.

- Our ball.

It's always your ball, though, right?
Damn right.

- Let's go.

You know what?

All right, back me up.
Step out.

- I got the help.

- Splash!

- Game.

That wasn't no motherfucking charge!
- My house, my call, man.

- Fuck out of my face.

- I'm gone.

Yeah, me, too, man.

- Fuck this game.

Eat your Wheaties, motherfucker.
What you complaining about?

- This motherfucker is my ride.

Great game, son.
Thank you, Dennis.

Thank you, Rick.
- Loving the pad, man.

Hope it's got an infirmary.
And a full rehab center.
Might need to add a nursery.
What are you talking about?
You remember Amber?
Shorty with the Pac tattoo?

Yeah.

At least I think she is.

Yeah, now it makes sense why you've been playing like Draymond Green out there.
I ain't ready for no kid, Spence.
I mean, even if I was, I wouldn't want one with her.
I mean, she bad as hell and all, but stability is not her specialty.
I told you a thousand times, Ricky, you got to cover that little man up.
I thought I did.

Besides, you always bag it?
No, but my pullout is straight 100, brother.
Come on, man, you ain't never hit the bull's-eye, not once?
- Never.

Are you sure you got swimmers?
Shit.
I mean, seriously, how do you know?
How we looking with that new deal, though?
- We're looking good, man.

- Me and Jay were all over New England.

I love when a manager's a step ahead of the game.
Let me tell you something else.

You don't have to worry about that.

You promised full payment of the five mil the first year.
I'm on schedule.

Morning, boss.
There's my man crush Monday!
What the fuck?

No, I'm not okay, all right?

Oh, really?

Well, he wants to know how we're looking with paying back the fucking loan.
Oh, Jesus...
You ever hear that old saying
"never lend friends and family money"?
Yeah.
Well, maybe the more important adage should be
- don't fucking take it.

I got three months to make good on my word, okay?

Told you not to promise.
Steph Curry's on line 1 for you.
Steph Curry.

Take it.
Steph Curry.
The baby-faced assassin.

What up, Spency-Spence-Spency-Boo?
What's going on?
Hey, me and Ayesha got a couple of days off.
We're going down to the Albany in the Bahamas.
Hey, Spence.

Hey.

I'm a little light on travel companions these days.
Spence, don't play me.
You know I saw you on your game the other night at International Smoke.
Buy one, get one, Hot Wing Tuesday.
Or in your case, Hot Girl Tuesday.
- I never forget.

Nothing gets past my girl at that restaurant, Spence.
No, I heard that.

It's a very sad but true story.
Hey, well, listen, we'll be in Miami for the night.
We should get together and do something.
Love to.

Yo, we can even talk some business, too.
You know, my Slyce digital media company.
Love it.

You, uh, hit me when you touch down.
- Safe travels.

You thought it was a date night.
Just trying to get you in the mile-high club.
Oh, my God.

I didn't know you knew Steph Curry.
Well, I know a lot of guys you don't know that I know, Joe.
All right?

He'd be the perfect guy to build our hoops business around.
Ah, so this is the next step in your global domination.
Well, it's all about expansion, Joe.
Plus, it'll be a good opportunity for us to pay back Ricky and Vernon before the end of Q4.
Oh, hey, you don't have to justify it to me, pal.
We're both big boys with big appetites and big balls.
It's just that yours are a little bit bigger than mine.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna take these big, heavy nuts and I'm gonna go over here to Anderson's office
- and loop him in.

It's that time of the year again, folks.
Since the Chargers...
You don't wait for a response before entering the boss's office?
Partner, Mr. Anderson.
Junior partner, Spencer.
Hey, what do you think of all this NFL expansion talk?
Well, I think it's a big opportunity for anybody to get their hands into it.
Really?
Mexico, China.
They're really gonna send the Jaguars to London?
No.

Huh.
Who would have thought such a barbaric business could be so sophisticated?
Yeah, it's a high-stakes business, Mr. Anderson.
The future of these cities depends on it.
Just like the future of ASM depends on what kind of moves we make here at home.
And what kind of moves are you thinking of, Spencer?
Steph Curry.
He's flying in and, um,
I thought we'd have dinner with him tonight, me and you.
Uh, I have a dinner tonight with Wayne Hastings, so no can do.
- Sorry.

The casino guy, Spencer.
One Wayne Hastings is worth 10 Steph Currys.
- Believe me.

We're in the sports business.
Well, actually, we are in whatever business
I want to be in.
See, I have a different vision for us, and that involves a magical little oasis in the middle of the desert known as Las Vegas.
I've been after this Wayne Jr.

Remember, house always wins.
And I want a wing in that mansion.
Athletes and gambling, it just...

Well, it fits for me.

Mr. Anderson, I seem to remember way back when, when you said you would be nothing but supportive of us and you said that you would be a strategic partner for us.
You even happened to say that you would be a closer.
I need you to help me close Steph Curry.
You know what?

You use your charms, help me close Wayne Hastings, and I will close the two-time MVP.
- Done.

Bring him to dinner tonight, 7:00.
- You got it.

Remember, you may have goals, but I have... bigger ones.
Hey, hey, there he go.
- What up, Chuck?

- I'm telling you.

Hey, Jack Moore.

- You have a good one?

- Oh.

What's that mean?
It means Siefert's speech about family and loyalty was bullshit.
You got fired?
What gave it away?
The cardboard box with all my stuff in it?
Oh, I'm sorry, Jack.
I didn't mean to sound insensitive.
Man, there's no room for sensitivity here.
Oh, but don't sweat it.

You got nothing to worry about.
How you figure that?
He plucks you from the trash pile and moves you to the front office?
Must be a reason for that, no?
Uh...
Have a great season, Charles.
Yo, man, look what the tooth fairy dropped off.
Who lost a tooth?

This shit is dope.
It's soft as fuck, man.

Yo, man, feel this shit.
Damn.

But I wasn't expecting nothing like this.
What's wrong with it?
I mean, this shit is cool, Reg, but it's a little in-your-face.
Yeah, 200 grand in your face.
I don't know, Reg.
Maybe we should ask Spence.
What the fuck for, man?
We know Spencer's Dr. No.

- Maybe you're right.

We're not doing nothing wrong but looking out for ourselves.
Now, if we don't do it, who the fuck gonna do it?
Spencer would.
He right about that.
Man, who the fuck asked you?
Make a sandwich or some shit.
We gonna do this shit or what, man?
Amber!
Amber?

Why ain't you returning any of my calls?
Maybe because I don't wanna talk to you, Ricky.
Don't you think you... don't you think you need to talk to me, given your situation?
- My situation?

Don't you mean our situation, asshole?
Hey, no need to get excited, all right?
I just wanna know, are you or aren't you?
So, you aren't here because you actually care about me or your unborn child.
You only give a damn about yourself.
- So that's a yes.

So you can stop your recon mission.
Oh, you think you're relieved.
Well, I'm relieved, too, because you're not exactly my top choice of baby daddy.
Oh?

Oh, let's see.

There's Roger who bags my groceries.
Hell, I'd take TTD if he'd stop blazing.
You're lying.
I never lie.
Whoa, whoa.

I know I came off like an asshole.
Truth is I do care.
And I would care if you were carrying my baby.
You swear?
I swear.
Okay.
I take back what I said, too, then.
Good.
You look good.
You look good.
Everything looks great, Spencer.
- Hey.

I feel great.

Pain?
Uh, 2 out of 10.
Cut way back on the Vikes.
- Great news.

Yeah, and, hey, thanks for making me go bionic.
My pleasure.
Anything else bothering you?
Well, um, it's kind of delicate.
Not your field.
Never stopped you before.
Lay it on me.
We'll see what I can do.
All right.

It's the, um... it's the area between my hips.
I see.
Erectile dysfunction?

God, no.

It's, um, fertility.
Are you trying to get someone pregnant?
Nope, not even in a conversation.
Then what's the issue?
I never have.
No close calls?
Nope.

I thought I was a master at precision timing, but, um, it seems like that might not be the case, and, uh, it's got me thinking.
About?
Fatherhood.
I mean, I might not be ready for it now, but... one day down the line, I might want to plant a seed.
And... and as any good farmer will tell you, you plant a seed and nothing grows, it's just a real fucking bummer.
Completely understood.
You're in luck.
There's a fertility doctor just down the hall.
Dr. Dester's one of the finest around.
Let me see if I can get you in there.
Right now?
Okay, I'll just...

All right?

It's time to downsize.
Downsize what?
House, for one.
- I got three houses.

You got three houses.
Now, I know that you can play for 10 more years.
- 20.

But at some point, it's gonna end, right?
You got three houses.

I'm not dumping my Miami or my Scottsdale house.
Why?

Yeah, but one's wet and one's dry.
I need that shit.

To exfoliate my skin.

- That's the trick?

Uh, okay, what about the Baltimore house, then?
I ain't dumping my Baltimore house, man.
That city been good to me.
Yeah, stay loyal to the community.
- Exactly.

You need to make tough adult choices now.
So, you need to decide whether you want a lot of space now or a little bit less space, but for a lot longer.
Entrez.
Ah, Sir Charles.
Heard you been waiting to see me all day.
What's on your mind?
So, I ran into Jack Moore this morning.
How was he?
He was fired.
Yes, he was, Charles.
We're making moves.
Heading in a nouvelle direction, as they say.
Anything I need to know about?
I'm teaching myself French.
You know that "no" means the same in French and English?
Same as the word direction.
I know that "oui" means "yes."
Had a girl say it to me once.
The answer is no, Charles.
There's nothing you need to know.
Other than we need to do a better job than we did last season.
If we don't, we may be out of jobs ourselves.
Yeah, people are talking.
I mean, what are we telling them?
Good question.
Here's a list of talking points.
We're holding a press conference for local sports writers and media.
Mm-hmm.
I want you to take it.
Take it?
As in, like, talk to the press?
Oui, Charles.

Yeah?
Boo boo, take a deep breath.
Steph's office called.

- All right, how late?

Are you serious?
Riley's team made it to the basketball finals.
Fuck.

What was that?
It's nothing.
Can you let Anderson's office know, please?
Right away.
And, Virginia?

Hang in there, boo boo.
I'll let you know what Anderson says.
Thanks.
Hi, um, it's Spencer Strasmore.
Yes, we've been expecting you, Mr. Strasmore.
Please fill this out.
It's gonna be a few minutes.
The collection rooms are running behind.
Of course.
Have you ejaculated in the last 72 hours?
Excuse me?
I think you understand the question.
I'll, uh...

Hmm.
Mr. Anderson.
Why did you promise me Steph Curry when you didn't have him?

Well, I didn't actually promise, Mr. Anderson.
Well, I told Wayne that Steph Curry was coming.
He went berserk.
So do me a favor, Spencer.

- Okay?

No, this is no joke.

Been having the same dinner with Wayne prick-fuck Jr. for five years.
For five long years, I have been pitching this casino thing to deaf ears.
He needs to hear a new voice.
So you just find me someone else who can pop 35-footers.
In fact, if you do that, Spencer,
I will pay off your debts to your friends.
You got that?
- Loud and clear.

Please.
we need some assistance, please.
in room 12.
All right, man.
Next.
Hey, what's up, little man?

Yeah, but sign them on the bottom.
I don't want to ruin their value.
Hey, Vernon, can I ask you a question?
Let me guess.

Hell, no.

I am?

40 solo tackles, 9 1/2 sacks.
Oh, and I like the way you call sacks "snacks."
- All right.

What I was gonna ask is, where you all get them hoodies?
Yeah, they're fucking dope.
Oh, we don't sell those here, and we never will.
- Well, you should.

Well, adios.
Hey, little man.
Catch.
- Oh.

Byron, what's Dwyane Wade's number?
That's easy.

His cell phone, Byron.

- Track down Spoelstra for me.

Hey.
How's that hip doing, huh?

- Hip is A-okay.

Even with all this Southern Florida humidity, huh?
So, you missed a delightful lunch with Sizz.
Ripped me a new asshole in the middle of Greenhouse when I told him he had to downsize.
This client service thing is really taking its toll.
Yeah.

I fucking lost Steph tonight for Anderson's dinner, and now I got to text Pat Riley to see if any of the Heat are in town.
Jesus!
When's it gonna end?
Spencer, we run a major financial institution.
I thought we were done being party wranglers.
This is why we need to own our own assets.
Yeah, preferably ones that don't breathe and tear their ACLs.
All right, I need to find somebody impressive enough to help Anderson close Wayne Hastings Jr. tonight.
Uh, okay.

How about yourself?
Oh, what?
So you're not 7'9"
and the only thing you dribble is Don Julio?
So what?
Wayne Hastings should fucking blow you for all the money you've lost at his tables.
Okay, oh, so you're not LeBron or Giancarlo Stanton or Maria fucking Sharapova, but you're still Spencer fucking Strasmore.
You are the asset.
You just gave me chills, Joe.
You're absolutely right.
You know what?
If all this isn't good enough for him?
To hell with him.
Yeah, I admit... this?
More than enough for any man.
And besides, what's in it for us?
Well, Anderson's gonna pay off our debt to Ricky and Vernon.
That's it.
Oh, you better close this Wayne motherfucker.
- Hi.

I'm sorry, one question at a time, please.

Wh-who are you?

I'm Charles Greane, assistant GM.
And, uh... and... and today, the organization made a change in the coaching staff.
And we are now moving in a new direction.
And what direction is that?
The opposite direction of the one we were moving in before.
- Why are we talking to you?

Yes.

- What was your question, sir?

Oh.
Uh, hmm.
Chuck, let me.

Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Coach Csonka.
Let me start by saying there is no power struggle.
This organization stands linked shoulder-to-shoulder.
I'm here from the coaching side, representing Coach Berg and joining Charles and Mr. Siefert's whole team in saying we are committed to winning.
And we will stop at nothing to bring another championship to our great fans like we did in the past.
Thank you all very much for being here.
Let's get off the stage.
I didn't mean it when I said if I was gonna have a baby, you wouldn't be high on my list.
Yeah, I knew that.
Yeah, you did call me out on it.
Truth is I think you'd be an amazing father.
Everything I do is amazing.
Yeah, you do.
You know what?
If I were gonna have a baby mama,
I'd want her to be just like you.
- For real?

You gonna have a pretty baby for sure.
Yeah, it makes me feel so good to hear you say that.
Good.

I wanna make you feel good, too.
That's why I wanna be straight up.
Well, you could always be straight up with me, Amber.
Okay.

'Cause I lied when I said I wasn't pregnant.
I am.
I thought you said you never lie.
Well, I lied when I said that.
Well, are you sure the baby's mine?
- I mean, do you even know?

I haven't been with anyone else, and I know your narcissistic ass can believe that.
I had to ask.
I'm gonna be by your side the whole time.
You promise?
- True.

Gotta hand it to you, Bret, you stepped it up.
The scenery is much better than that gay pride party you hosted in Palm Beach.
It wasn't a gay pride party.
You were with that crazy Colombian.
That would be my wife, and she's Slovenian.
Is there a difference?
- You must be the new partner.

Spencer Strasmore, meet Wayne Hastings Jr., the one and only.
Ah, Wayne, it's a pleasure to meet you.
You know, Mr. Anderson says great things about you.
Yes, I do.
I used to watch your games with my old man.
You were a serious force.
Ah, well, I like to think I could still light 'em up, Wayne.
I think you can.
I gotta tell you, I'm a big fan of your hotels.
As a matter of fact, every time I'm in Vegas, uh, I like to heavily contribute.
And we appreciate that.
- Sure.

- That's nasty.

Hey, which makes me Mr. Anderson's partner as well.
Nice to met you, Joe.
So I hear Steph Curry won't be joining us.
That's too bad.

I know, and I apologize to you, but you have my word I'll make it up to you one day.
I promise.
Speaking of that water show, how is it you keep coming up with these different concepts?
It's just... it's fantastic.
It's easy, Bret.
I just close my eyes and dream big.
I did the same thing and I wound up working for Mr. Anderson.
Ah, you should dare to dream bigger, Spencer.
Ah, there you go.
We go down table, and everyone say something they are grateful for.
And after each, we drink.
Why don't you start us off, Joe?
Okay.
Um, ahem, let me see here.
Uh, I...

And sunny days.
Um, I'm grateful for piece of world.
I think you mean world peace, hon.
- No, I want piece of world.

You gotta love a woman who knows what she wants.
Hey, Spencer, why don't you throw on some Speedos and dive into the deep end here?
Sure.
All right.
Well, I have a lot to be grateful for.
Um, first and foremost,
I never thought that I would ever see myself at a dinner party like this.
I mean, ever.
You know, where I came from,
I never thought that I'd make it past my 21st birthday, let alone ever having a life like this.
Is that true?
Have you ever been to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Wayne?
I think I passed it on the way to Saint-Tropez.
Ah.
Well, it sure as hell ain't sun and sand, my friend.
I was...

And what changed?
Football.
Football gave me a life that I'm very proud of.
It also gave me a career that I felt extremely blessed to have.
You're an American success story.
You know, just like your father and yourself.
The only difference is after the game...
I found myself right back where I started.
But as luck would have it, the universe delivered, and delivered to me Mr. Anderson.
And without this man,
I wouldn't have the opportunity that I have today.
So, sir, cheers to you.
- I'm very grateful.

Thank you.
I can go on forever about what I'm grateful for.
But in addition to the race cars, the speed boats, the buildings bearing the Wayne name,
I'm grateful for guys like Spencer.
Real men who roll up their sleeves and grind it out.
So, this is a toast to you, Spencer.
Thank you.
Oh, watch out.
You out here reflecting on those Bethlehem days?
Nah, just getting a little fresh air.
You gave a good push on Bret's behalf.
He really should appreciate you.
Ah, just wasn't only on his behalf.
Anderson's business is my business, and he wants in on your business.
Look, Wayne, you could do a lot worse than Bret Anderson as your shareholder.
Well, if his business is your business,
- let me ask you.

What can you bring to the table other than capital and opinions, because I can raise money anywhere, Spencer, and the only opinion I like is my own.
Okay.
Sports, Wayne.
Sports rules the world.
My dad always used to say, "Pussy rules the world."
Your dad's a smart man.
But, you know, times have changed.
They certainly have.
Anderson's been after me for years to get into my business, my father before me.
The truth is he didn't need anyone, and neither do I.
People will look to give away money to casinos from now until the end of time.
But I do like you, Spencer.
So, who knows?
Maybe there's something else we can work on in the future.
- Yeah, maybe.

Wayne, let me ask you something.
How would you feel about bringing an NFL team to Las Vegas?
I love that idea.
I love that idea.
The way I see it, only one way to take a team to Vegas, and that's big.
Well, that's the only way we do it.
You better make it a quickie, 'cause my girls are waiting.
Your girls can wait, by the way.
Don't even put me on the clock.
Tuition paid!
Woo!
I just came down to invite you over to dinner.
Dinner, with my sworn enemy?
That was stupid.
Spencer, I just wanna know if you're an enemy of the league.
What does that even mean?
Well, that's a threat, Joe.
You're gonna get it right in the teeth on this one.
You know that, right?
Right in the teeth.
