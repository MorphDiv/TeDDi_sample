Se-Hwa!
Those two live well.
They're well and safe.
They had pretty babies and lived happily a long time, growing old together.
Lies again.
It was all lies again.
Who are you?
Where are we?
Why am I here?
I saw the people you killed.
I heard their screams.
What are you saying?
Who would I kill?
Who are they?
People born blessed as family members, fell in love and dreamed of growing old together.
You destroyed their futures in one moment.
I know nothing.
I'll end it also.
I'll make your life a blank page so you can't remember anything or receive forgiveness.
~ Legend of the Blue Sea ~
Aah!
Be careful.
The fugitive!
For the last time, I'll say-
Please, believe me.
Trust me, and leave with me.
I'm not leaving.
How could you be so loud?
Hi, the job is complete.
For a short time, treated bugs might start coming out.
EPISODE 17
If you stop talking, it seems I was your topic.
Why haven't you met us lately?
Come sit here.
Kang Seo Hee is correct.
But who invited you?
You might be uncomfortable so I didn't invite you.
Why would I feel uncomfortable?
What will you say?
Rather than saying it...
Unni, come in.
Heo Joon-Jae, I liked it here.
It was my first home.
Come in.
Give and take.
When you're alone, you must do what you want.
I have a warm place out of the cold, to talk, laugh and have fun with you.
No-one can go home, especially you.
I won't leave you.
I can see you anytime and love you whole-heartedly.
But I don't think I can be here, beside you.
I'll go.
Since you're here, the reason we met may be good for you to hear.
Well, through SNS (social networks) you may know this unni is
Cheong Hae, CEO Heo's ex-wife, his first wife.
After divorce, this unni parted from her son.
Recently, those two reunited dramatically.
I told you.
I'd find Joon-Jae and restore him to his rightful place.
Look forward to it.
I congratulate you.
Finding your son is touching, but restoring his place won't be easy.
That place disappeared.
What?
You all haven't heard.
Recently my husband, with regard to property, stocks, cash, capital, everything, left it all in his Will to Chi-Hyun and me.
Ah!
If the CEO steps down, his position goes to Chi-Hyun, right?
I'll remember the faces of those here.
You should pray that you'll never need my help.
Oh my!
Is that true, Unni?
Why'd he cut out his own son?
If it's true, CEO Heo is a puppet!
H-hello?
What?
You are?
What are you at again?
What's wrong?
Take your medication.
I don't even know who I am.
And those people?
They left.
Okay.
Did anyone come in here?
Who?
Ajumma mentioned workers.
I was unaware.
I see.
Your security system had a 2 hour outage.
So you have no footage?
He really left everything to Kang Seo Hee and her son?
You truly got abandoned.
Why do I feel deflated?
There's no proof my dad checked the Will.
How's that?
My dad... seemed almost blind.
Cornea injury.
He stared at me without recognition.
Why'd you come out without him?
He disbelieved me as a conman.
Also...these.
Kang Seo Hee avids drugs, so she'd feed my dad these.
Find who prescribed it.
One more thing.
It was suspicious her room was filled with these flowers.
What's this flower?
Wolf's Bane?
In Roman times, stepmothers assassinate princes with it.
If it's Wolf's Bane, in Japan and here, people were killed with Wolf's Bane tea.
So please help urgently.
With all this proof, get a warrant fast.
Hey, it's not easy-
You got kicked out?
The Mister told me I'll go to that family.
Why'd you get kicked out?
I cried and screamed at night from nightmares.
Is it a rich family?
My twin sister got a rich family.
I wish I could too.
If I go to that family, can I write you letters?
The Little Mermaid?
Upstairs.
Hey!
What's up?
What were you doing?
Let me see.
Why are you so cold?
I have to think but if you hear me,
I can't think clearly, and my mind's a mess.
Think about what?
I don't know your thoughts but you hear mine.
Please get away from me.
Or should I go?
You're... still okay, right?
Your heart beat seems fine.
Just go.
OK, I was on my way.
Should I leave the house, or just my room?
I can't hear you there.
I'll say if it's noisy.
I got it, now go?
Okay.
No, but I seem to be at fault if she rejected me.
Right, nothing can be done.
Then you did do wrong.
I didn't.
Know what it means when a woman wants to think?
What is it?
The woman thinks about what he did wrong and how to react.
Death by 1000 Cuts or flogging.
Is that it?
Isn't that a person?
I can hear people's screams but I don't know why?
I don't know why your memory is fading in and out... but even with memories missing, Ma Dae-Young is Ma Dae-Young.
Someone who seeks revenge.
Re-revenge?
You truly don't remember?
No.
Were you ever happy?
You always felt stepped on.
So you took revenge.
You did as you should.
So, that many people...
Anger control problems gave you memory loss.
It's a side effect of losing control.
I'm by your side.
Aren't those mine?
What?
Why's it noisy?
Why's it noisy, I said!
It's soybean paste stew!
Hey, the quiet is nice.
I thought my ears would burst.
I covered my ears but my throat hurts.
A smart guy would think why his throat hurts.
The soybean paste stew is so good!
It's seasoned just right!
Why not?
How'd you get evidence with no warrant?
The son went in, not broke in.
He walked in confidently.
He likes that style.
It's a personal preference.
Shut up, punk!
Kang Seo Hee had paralytic pills used for insomnia and as a muscle relaxant in anesthesia.
Evidence obtained illegally can't be accepted in court!
You know it, what the heck!
I don't know at all!
Your dad needs a transplant soon.
We're hacking their data.
I saw nothing.
Ajumma!
Yes, Madam.
Did anyone come in here?
I said to let no-one in here!
Hey, she noticed?
Or we'll barge in without one.
Take your medicine to improve your condition for surgery.
Kang Seo Hee's real name is Kang Ji Yeon.
Her 2 previous husbands died, one blinded and hit by a car, one from heart failure.
Secretary Nam may wake soon.
Doctors say he recovered miraculously.
We've never been blessed with much luck.
There's a balance to good and bad fortune.
You've used up your bad luck and now have good luck ahead of you.
Choi Min Gyu?
You're an investor for a new aquarium project?
Yes.
A Sand Tiger Shark comes from Florida, USA.
It, and a whale shark, each cost $100,000.
Is that right?
If a mermaid existed, how much?
Whether it's a hoax hasn't been determined, but if a real live mermaid was found, it's impossible to price it.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars?
Why ask that?
Just because I have a mermaid friend.
Introduce that mermaid friend to me?
I'd like to.
Tears, eh?
What Dirty Love?
What's hurting?
I was so surprised at your call, I skipped study.
I may have to leave here soon.
I wanted to say goodbyes.
You're the first good friend I met here.
When I had it tough, I relied on you.
You felt like my Unni.
That's a bit heavy.
Too bad; it's true.
My teacher.
You taught me everything.
But you're the only one who listens to me.
If I talk to others, they give me money or spit on me.
It's my appearance.
Regardless, you're a great life coach to me.
It's good luck I met you.
Life is a series of chance encounters.
Valuing those encounters makes good connections.
Otherwise, life is lonely.
Let me hug you, my friends.
Hi, Joon-Jae, it's me.
I'm at a cafe.
You must've heard.
Living in the same house made her seem friendlier.
Finding out she was your mother was like a fated connection.
A connection?
What connection?
Um...it's...well...
I don't know how this will sound.
I may have missed the timing.
But I want to tell you once..
I like you very much as a man.
For 7 years,
I looked at your back more than your eyes.
And I know who's in your heart now.
I like you, so I can wait.
She's a strange, unique, charming, and lovely woman.
However, she's not the type to stay put, so...
Don't wait for me.
If Chong goes elsewhere, I'll follow her, so... don't wait for me, Shi-Ah.
Don't look at my back.
Find a good man who looks in your eyes.
I should've told you sooner.
I'm sorry.
Like a rat-
You bastard...
Why?
Why'd you enter my house?
Were you trying to meet Father?
Joon-Jae, Father says he'd rather not see his conman son.
He says I'm his son!
Shut up.
Why?
Did I say something wrong?
You are a con man.
Why didn't you tell me Dad's eyes are like that?
It was your mother's doing.
Weren't you well aware of your mother's doings?
You knew and let it go on?
Why?
Why, you mad bastard!
You said he was the first father you had, so how'd you do that?
Stop your mother now.
Stop her doing that to my father.
Now I found out,
I'll ensure you and your mother die.
Ms. Chong came to see me.
You sent her to me so you could sneak into my house?
Just to keep me away?
Are you in a position to protect anyone?
~ even saying I love isn't a comfort ~
~ I'm falling into deep darkness ~
What?
You have thoughts you won't share.
Tell me those, and why you're like this.
I gave you that bangle.
When I found the bangle deep on the sea bed,
I thought it was by chance.
When I think back, it wasn't a coincidence.
At that moment, our fate began repeating.
I wondered why I crossed that wide ocean to come here.
But that too was fate, that shouldn't have begun.
What are you saying?
You said they lived well, happily till old age, in our past life story.
In the cold sea.
That...
How...
When you went to your dad's home, I met Heo Chi-Hyun.
And I saw Ma Dae-Young.
I held Ma Dae-Young's hands and erased his stories.
I saw our ending in his memory.
So then...
My scariest dream is where everything repeats.
A dream where everything repeats?
I've learned the meaning of the dream you fear.
So I'm your most feared dream, right?
No.
Knowing our fate, you would trace that path?
That won't happen.
I shouldn't have come.
Then nothing would repeat.
So then?
Do you regret it?
Meeting me, coming here, being together?
~ as soon as I recognized you ~
~ my nameless love may have begun ~
~ before I knew you ~
~ in 1 in 10,000 chances, our love came to be ~
~ in 1 in 10,000 chances, you and I began ~
~ I will use the feeling ~
~ so love may not end for you ~
~ all my moments are for you ~
No.
I don't regret it.
How can I regret it?
I feel the same.
Despite knowing it all,
I couldn't regret it.
Meeting you was not something I could regret.
I fear you'll die because of me.
If... truly if what you fear happens, your heart must keep beating.
You should know, even if I'm not by your side,
I'll keep loving you.
~ that this love may not end ~
~ for you ~
~ all my moments are for you ~
Where are you?
~now I'm leaving your heart which saw me closer
~than the friendship closer than love
~I hate myself whom you cherished more
~than anyone else more than me
~I, who don't want an awkward relationship
~neither friend nor lover, am leaving
I truly, really, liked him so much so long.
Stay here temporarily.
Stay in the basement room in the day.
Ajumma goes home at 5pm.
Come up then.
Did someone else go in?
Kang So Hee drove in.
Was someone else in that car?
Heo Il Joong knows your voice as his new secretary.
Pretend to assist him.
Make sure he can't go out.
Stop him using his cell phone.
As he can't see, it won't be difficult.
Can you still remember nothing?
Heo Il Joong knows your voice as his new secretary.
Pretend to assist him.
Make sure he can't go out.
Stop him using his cell phone.
As he can't see...
Who's she talking to?
The other's voice can't be heard.
You still remember nothing?
Come to your senses!
Ma Dae-Young.
It's Ma Dae-Young can't remember anything now.
What can't he remember?
Who he is, or what terrible deeds he has done.
Why can't he recall those things?
We'll get it by tomorrow.
Thank you.
Honey.
What?
I have an appointment this evening.
Take the medicine and sleep.
Take your medicine.
Uh, right.
Where's your phone?
The phone is turned off...
I'll be back.
Seo Hee.
What?
Since you met me, was there a single moment you loved me?
I never had a single moment I didn't love you.
I'll be back.
OK.
Where's she headed late?
Have a drink with Mom?
In a place with a lot of people.
The attorney seems to have deposited money in a false name.
Unable to come to the phone right now.
Please leave a message at the tone.
Joon-Jae...
You shouldn't be home yet.
Joon-Jae...
I was wrong.
Joon-Jae...
Hyung, contact Detective Hong.
What's going on?
What's going on?
Not sure.
You were right.
My choices were wrong from beginning to end.
Why was that so hard to acknowledge?
Why did it take me so long?
I-I missed you.
I wanted to return to times with you and your mom.
Why did I ignore those feelings?
Why was saying 'I was wrong' so hard?
I regret it so much.
If I could do it over,
I want to go back to being my wife's husband and my son's father.
That's me being greedy.
I'm sorry, Joon-Jae.
I love you, my son.
No...
It's not supposed to be yet.
It's not supposed to be over, Father.
It's not time yet, Father.
Please.
Dad!
Dad...
