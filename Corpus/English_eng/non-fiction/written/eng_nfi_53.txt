What if we hack our code onto the Hoolicon app.
I mean, that's malware, Richard.
Think of it more as forced adoption through aggressive guerrilla marketing.
As a product of forced adoption I can assure you there are consequences.
You're not seriously thinking of going to Tibet?
Just give whatever you're comfortable with.
I'll pay for it, whatever your costs.
Jesus.
(Yelling)
Kandu in the house.
Are you fucking kidding me?
If there's an upside to any of this,
I realize now what I have in Dan.
Richard.

Good.

Melcher's data onto a network of mobile devices.

Are you guys ready to see the future?
Prepare to be amazed.
- (Screaming) - (Sparking)
You don't think this had anything to do with us, do you?
Oh fuck!
- (man shouting) - (woman shrieks)
Oh!

So, you're certain?
Definitively.
The 36 HooliPhones that blew up at Hoolicon and the 17 that blew up around the US all had our code on them.
Richard, these are real people with real crotches, and they're burning.
We have to tell someone.

No.

Jack ported it to a phone in four days.
They wrote sloppy code that's pinging the antenna constantly, looking for the goggles.
That had to have caused the phone's antenna to draw too much power...
Which would overheat the subpar battery.
And when we pinged our network on top of all that...
- Dick fire.

We committed a crime here.
- Barely, Jared.

Agreed.

Monica will fund us, and no one will ever know what we did.
- I'll know!

I'm sorry.
(rustling)
What the fuck is this?
I write three letters every time I start a job... a personal action plan, a letter to my 40-year-old self, and that, a resignation letter.
Uh, I'll be moving my things back into my condo.
- What about your squatter?

He left to go sell cocaine at the Keystone Pipeline protests.
I've just been staying in the garage out of solidarity.
You can't leave.
- Don't beg, Richard.

According to the employee handbook, which you wrote, an employee cannot leave without giving two weeks' notice.
You... you read the handbook?
- Yeah, I did.

I'll fulfill my duties under protest, but I will not do anything illegal nor unethical, and I will not lie.
I already have upwards of 50 burnt perinea on my conscience.
Richard, that's enough.
Consider that my two weeks' notice.
- (door opens)

What do you mean you're not issuing a software update?
Who can say why the phone Gavin Belson brought to market started exploding when we put Keenan Feldspar's technology on it?

Is it Gavin's fault?

We need to change the narrative here.
Has anyone flown commercial recently?
Nor have I, but apparently they're still making the announcements at the gate about Samsung Galaxy Note 7 being banned.
We can't have people believing that our phones blow up airplanes, no matter how much Gavin and/or Keenan may have wanted it.
It's lethal PR.
We need to get ahead of this one, which is why I am going to pull every last affected HooliPhone out of circulation and replace it in the next three days.
That's over nine million devices.
Gavin Belson had to move heaven and earth to get our China plants up to a capacity of two million per day, and his negotiations with labor were extremely delicate.
Well, China has never negotiated with Jack Barker.
What you're proposing is staggeringly expensive and borderline impossible.
We won't approve it.
I see.

Slight hitch.

- Yeah, it's out.

I'll tell you what:

(theme music playing)
So, every fucking HooliPhone that we're on is being pulled out of service and replaced with a new one that doesn't have our code on it.
Half of our storage capacity just gone.
Where the fuck are we gonna put all of Melcher's data?
Wait.

Now, don't you think if Anton could've saved our ass,
I would've suggested it by now?
- Why can't it work?

In order to hold that much data, we would have to go RAID zero, no backup, so if we lose even one platter, we lose Melcher's data... permanently.
Plus, in Anton's present condition,
I'm afraid he might totally melt down.
- We have to call Melcher.

If we tell him about any of this, that would be suicide.
Look, if we're gonna die, let's just die.
Why do we have to take Anton with us?
Jesus, man.

- Fuck your dumb machine.

Do you actually fuck your dumb machine?
- Is that the secret on your phone?

- Fuck you!

Or do you put a condom on your tiny penis and fuck it in safe mode?
Just fuck each other and get it over with. "Oh, Anton, fuck me!"
- I will fuck both of you...

- Gentlemen!

She's interviewing to be my replacement.
Hello.
I like your sweater.
Maybe let's talk outside.
- Great.

Gilfoyle, Anton is going to be fine, okay?
Just spin him up.

All right, buddy.
- (whirring)

Outstanding.
I'm sorry that you had to witness that scene in there.
It probably gave you the impression that the company is in disarray, but I can assure you, there's a very simple explanation for that.
- It... it is.

Yeah, even setting aside our CEO's sexual distortion, adultery, and lowbrow scatlogical vandalism, we're still essentially a... a criminal operation whose only real product is dangerous malware.
I see you're fluent in Japanese.
Are... are you gonna be comfortable with casual racism?
I'm sorry.

Uh, arson.
(distant monks chanting)
- (whispering) Hsst!

That wasn't really breakfast, was it?
Yeah.
- Seriously?

(sighs)
What are you doing?
Well, I'm watching an episode of House.
Put that fucking thing away.
Are you afraid it's gonna blow up?
'Cause it won't.

Why would a HooliPhone blow up?
Hey!

How's it going in here?
Don't touch the fucking lights.

- What the fuck?

Oh, the eyes.

Okay, how we looking?
Jesus Christ!
I broke my glasses.

I was a cat.
How are we looking?

Yes, but Anton is overheating already.
We're about to fry three of our platters.
I said this was a bad idea.
Fuck.

Excuse me.

Oh, hey, Richard, long time, no talk.
Yeah, we've all been busy, so.
- Oh yeah?

Oh jeez.

Sure you can, man.

No, um, it-it... it's just, um, I'm kinda on super-thin ice with the head of the CS department right now.
After Erlich's whole SeeFood thing,
Standford started looking into my academic background, realized that I don't really have one, and now I'm on probation, and they've got this real teacher sitting in, watching me.
That is... that is a bummer.

They're not gonna notice a few more measly petabytes, all right?
We'll just get on and get off before anyone even notices we're there.
Yeah?

All right.

and my password is "password."
Your username is "password"?
It was just easier.
Okay, Big Head came through.
I've already reserved the resources.
We can start the transfer whenever we're ready.
Slight problem.

What the fuck?
I can't get on either.
Gilfoyle, did you fry the fucking router again?
No!
Jared!

No.

- What?

Wait.
Are you telling me Anton is completely cut off from the outside world?
Which means Melcher's data is offline.
We're in breach.
Shit.

A product recall on that scale?
What the fuck is Barker thinking?
Uh, I was only at eight percent, so if you could close some applications.
Monk:

Lama-la, I...

Enlightenment... or ignorance.
You must choose.
Erlich, get the bags.
- (Dan mumbles) - (phone buzzing)
Richard Hendricks.

Hi.

What?
Richard:

- Nothing major.

Richard:

- your user experience, because we care.

- (crashes)

- Dinesh:

- (thunks) - (Gilfoyle screams)
Yeah. "Okay"?

Dan.

It's totally normal.

Look, as long as you have it back online, you know,
- before we open in the morning.

Hey, you want to talk to Liz?
- No.

Why?

That's okay.

All right.

- Never get married, Richard.

- I'll talk to you.

(phone clicks)
We'll go to them.
Guys, we'll go to them.
- Who?

If we move Anton to Stanford, we can plug him directly into the cluster, and we'll be back online before Fiduciated opens.

Yeah, except for the part about moving Anton to fucking Stanford.
How the fuck are we gonna do that?
We take him apart, move him, put him back together.
- That's insane.

Is Big Head gonna be okay with us just showing up with three tons of unauthorized equipment?
Yeah!

He was like, "Uh, yeah." (chuckling)
Okay, do it.

Erlich:

You've killed my battery.
I don't feel the slightest bit more spiritually centered.
Can this thing go any faster?
- Richard.

Okay.

Uh, so, what... what time did Big Head say he needed us there?
I don't know.

Typically, campus security requires a specific window
- for deliveries of this size.

Did you send him an inventory, so that he could request and clear a static IP address for each server?
No.

Maybe I'll just give him a call.
Nah, it's fine.

- Well, maybe I'll just text him.

Just... just stop with the second-guessing, hand-wringing, pearl-clutching bullshit, okay, for just, like, a fucking minute.
You know what?

- You can go.

You wanted to go?

Bye.

I'll order a Lyft home and... (whispers) What the fuck was that?

He already quit, remember?
Besides, he was being a fucking asshole.
Jared was being an asshole?
Do you want to go with him?
Because, if you haven't noticed, if we don't get this shit to Standford and all set up by 9:00 a.m., we are fucked!
Jack:

I was just talking to your foreman, Jung-Sho... (speaks Chinese) and he seems to feel that you are all working at maximum capacity and that you cannot work any harder.
But I have just flown from America, and I'm here to prove to you that he is wrong.
You can work harder, much harder.
How?

- Come on.

Emily Chang:

Hooli CEO Jack Barker has been taken hostage by workers at a Hooli factory in China, which produces cell phones.
I want everyone to know I haven't been harmed... and the workers here have assured me that I will only be held as their honored guest until Hooli has met their very reasonable request for fair wages and for humane conditions.
- On a more personal note, honey...

I have to stop now.
Gilfoyle:

Holy shit.

All right.
- (exhales deeply)

(starter clicking)
What the fuck?
Shit.

(sighs) Well, do we have jumper cables?
- Jared did.

- Sounds like a Jared thing.

Aren't Anton's racks full of backup batteries?
(Richard sighs)
Okay.

Give us a minute.

(engine starts)
Uh, try it now.
Just fuck the batteries!

- Dinesh:

Okay, dude.

- (tires screech)

Oh, hey, Ashley.

Well, look, it won't be the last time you stop traffic, huh?
Little hottie.
But not now, when you're older.
I'm sorry, we have to...

- Back up, back up.

Big Head.

Now's not really a great time, Richard.
I'm sort of in the middle of something.
Wait.

Yeah, I know.

Come on, buddy, I need you.
Okay. (Clears throat) Be right there.
Can I go to the bathroom?
Are you sure?

It's no trouble at all, and there's no need to send a negotiator.
I'm in Tibet.

Well, we'd be grateful to have this in such good hands.
We've missed you, Gavin.
Perhaps when you return, we...
Please.

Fuck you, Jack Barker!
Hah!

- Hey.

Opium?

I was on the phone for, like, three minutes.
Big...

- Come on, get up.

We need to get to the airstrip.
(sighs)
(tires screech)
Shit.

Start unloading it.

Hey, man, so did you ever transfer all that data?
No, we just gotta unload our servers near the Sherlock arrays.
Servers?

- I know, I know, I know.

You never told Big Head
- we were bringing Anton here, did you?

He's everything that's packed into the back
- of this giant fucking truck.

And you want to set it all up here?
- (chuckles)

I told you I'm, like, so close to getting fired.
Big Head, come on.

Richard, you specifically told us that Big Head said this was okay.
That's what you fucking told us!
You lied to our faces again.
Come on, guys, we don't have time for this.
You were just going to show up and fucking steamroll him?
That was your whole plan?

He's Big Head!
He's gonna fall ass-backward into something, you know?
- He always does.

- (scoffs) What?

Now?

We... we got it.

You... hypocrites.
You fucking hypocrites.
When I wouldn't use the fake users, you called me a pussy.
When I wouldn't lie on the stand, you called me a pussy.
But now, when I'm actually doing what you've been wanting me to do, you quit?
You're the pussies.

I'm the only one that's trying to fucking... save what we do here!
All this time we spent building this thing, and now, now it falls apart because you two don't fucking do it?
- This is too much for you?

This is fine.
- What?

I thought you were talking about a lot more stuff.
Gre...
- Gilfoyle:

Fuck.
So, anyways, my office is unlocked if you guys just wanna, like, toss that on my desk or whatever.
I should probably get back, though, before that teacher guy gets me in trouble.
I'll see you guys.
Richard:

Who?
You had me open up the back... to get the batteries, and then you told me not to put them back, so... no one...
You know who would've remembered to close the door?
Jared.
(phone buzzing)
Richard:

Good luck with that.
(sighs)
(truck door opens, closes)
(engine starts)
(phone buzzes)
(knocks on door)
Richard.
Can I come in?
Umm... (clears throat) I have company.
- (woman laughing)

(women laughing)
How many girls are in there?
Richard, what do you want from me?

I killed Anton, and, uh, I lost all of Melcher's data, everybody fucking hates me, and I'm basically one blood boy away from being Gavin Belson.
I did not... (clears throat) run the company with integrity... but... (clears throat)
I'm gonna end it with some.
I'm going to Melcher's office, and I'm coming clean.
Anyway... (sighs)
I'm really fucking sorry, man.
Well, I'll leave you alone now.
Hey. "This guy fucks."
(chuckles)
Jared:

- What's this?

I'd like to submit myself for a position with Pied Piper.
I'd really like to be there till the bitter end.
"Lordy, Lordy, looks who's 40."
That's the wrong one.
(jet engines humming)
I gotta say, Gavin... when that storeroom door opened, and I saw your face grinning down at me,
I thought it was an angel. (Laughs)
When we get home, I'm going to do everything in my power to get you back in the good graces of the Hooli board.
I can use a fellow of your talents, sir.
That's very gracious of you, Jack.

Woman:

Our flying time to Mountain View is 11 hours and 36 minutes, and we will be stopping off in Jackson Hole first.
Oh.

- (chuckles)

Jackson Hole is definitively out of the way.

But I don't mind dropping you off first, this one last time.
(elevator dings)
(office phone rings)
Hey.

Jared called us.
If you're gonna eat a giant plate of steaming hot shit, we figured it should probably be a team effort.
(people chattering)
Okay.

Uh, I'll go check in.
Hi, could you tell Dan Melcher that Richard Hendricks and the guys from Pied Piper are here to see him?
You guys are Pied Piper?

Oh.

I was just using it two minutes ago.

- Really?

Uh... what's he talking about?
- (beeps)

All of Melcher's data is there.
How is that possible?
What are those devices?

(laughing creepily)
(whispers) Why the fuck are you laughing?
You look fucking insane right now.
Look at that OUI prefixes in these MAC addresses.
Yeah, okay, so what are those?
Smart fridges.
About 30,000 of them.
Come again?
Jian-Yang's smart fridge must have been self-correcting.
In order to fit my "Suck it, Jian-Yang" video onto his fridge,
I had to add Pied Piper libraries to the firmware.
Other smart fridges must've seen this as an update.
- What?

Right, so when we put that data onto Anton, the last thing he did before he died was back himself up onto a huge network of smart fridges.
Anton died so we could live.
Like Jesus.
Oh fuck.
(laughs) Guys, do you realize what just happened?
We're still alive.

- Gilfoyle:

- We did it!

Wait a minute.
If Melcher never lost access to his data, what's he so upset about?
Richard!

We were tasting cakes, and then you called,
- and then it just... came out.

- You son of a bitch!

- (punches thudding)

- Jared:

- Gavin.

I like your hair.
I like your eye.
Yeah, I...

She didn't hit me.

So... welcome home, and congratulations on getting your business back.
Thank you.

I hear you're swimming in funding offers.
A few.

- They seem to get us.

Richard, we were partners once.
I'd like to do it again.
This is an acquisition offer, and it will make you a very wealthy man.
Let's do this together.
That's very kind of you.
- But...

I can help you get exactly where you want to go.
I'm pretty sure I know where I want to go and how to get there.
If you reject me now, Richard, I will come after you.

Think very carefully about what you're doing here.
Here's what I think, Gavin.
I think my decentralized Internet threatens Hooli's box business model.
I think, basically, you are just a server company now, and we intend to make servers obsolete.
So, I think perhaps in the end, I will be the one devouring you.
I gave you that patent.
Thanks.
(sighs) Fair enough, Richard.
I shall look forward to the fight.
(chuckles) Right back at you, Gavy, baby.
Gavin.
Oh, um, did Erlich ever show up in Tibet?
No.
Jesus.

(mariachi music playing)
No.

No, no, no, no.

No.
