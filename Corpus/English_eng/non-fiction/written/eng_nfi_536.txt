What'd you do for fun last night?
Well, you have to admit, you make a great suspect.
It's from Brandon.
He and I never met, but we did write each other in high school.
Then the letters stopped and I never knew why.
Go ahead, read it, Beth.
He talks about you a lot.
You wanna know why I came to Grace Arbor?
I just wanted to know that there was some light somewhere.
That just maybe, Brandon had a better life than I had.
♪
It's all so clear to me now.
How do I know it's love?
I think I would die for her.
(sobbing)
(knocking)
Dude, I've been trying to get a hold of you.
Where you've been?
Chill man, I went to Sterling.
I talked to Coach Novotska.
Coach Novotska?
Yeah, I thought I should apologize.
He said he did a lot of asshole things, too, but he was cool.
I saw them take her body out.
Dude, it's Brandon's brother.
Check this.
His real name is Liam Bennett.
He was molested by both his parents.
They kept him in the basement for like three years.
Dude took his father's shotgun, killed them both.
Then he shot himself in the chest and lived.
He, he was exonerated by the courts because he was a minor.
He underwent major psychiatric counseling.
There's your killer.
He knows what happened to Brandon.
He knows we're involved.
Beth.
She told him.
Fucking Beth told him!

At the present time, it is unclear how many people inside are dead.

His name is Liam Bennett, but he goes by Rivers.
He's staying at the Motel down by the highway.

Liam, it's me Beth!

Liam, open up!
We can't stay here!

C'mon.
This is 8 David 4.
Request a unit be sent to 713 Whitney Ave.
To check the welfare of Jack Meyer.
I'm in route to the motel by the Highway.
Will advise when I'm 9/7.
Fucking Beth, man!
I never trusted that bitch.
RV-Ryan!
(tires squealing)
Dude, dude, dude, it's the Sheriff.
We almost hit the fucking Sheriff.
Shit.
Oh, we gotta go, we gotta go, we gotta go.
That's not mine.
I didn't put that there.
It wasn't me.
Let's go.
Let's, c'mon, let's just go, let's go, let's go!
Someone put it in my room.
Who, Beth?
You're the only one who knows where I was staying.
I wasn't thinking.
I mean, I brought them because I thought you might...
It's Nathan or Ryan...
Oh my God.
Why did you go to Sterling?
I went to talk to Coach Novotska, ok?
You don't believe me?
Call him!
Fuck man.
I don't know who to believe anymore.
Nathan, if I wanted you dead, you would have been first on my list.
I know what happened to you.
♪
(phone chiming)
It's Beth.
Get out of the car, Beth!
There was a game we played in therapy.
Did you know that, Beth?
C'mon Beth, you can do it.
Liam, I'm sorry for what happened to you, ok.
We all have fucked up pasts!
I'm not finished, Beth.
The shrinks thought it was important in my healing.
It's called re-association.
You re-live the moment of trauma and go back to where it all began.
Can you imagine?
Most kids are out playing football, going to their proms.
I was having my dreams analyzed by ten-dollar-an-hour therapists who fondled me in the name of mental health.
Where did it happen, Beth?
Where did it happen?
Right there.
♪
You want to know what the worst part about killing your parents is?
Think about it, Beth.
It's the guilt.
I actually felt guilty for taking those monsters' lives.
Guilt is a motherfucker, isn't it?
It eats away at your aspirations, your dreams, your fucking soul!
♪
You having a hard time sleeping at night, Beth?
What did you do to him?
It was just supposed to be a prank.
Jimmy was jealous of Brandon, he buried him in the sand after giving him some pills at a party.
He was only supposed to be unconscious for an hour.
But we fell asleep and the tide came in.
♪
Well, Beth...
I guess there's only one thing left to do.
I'm really sorry about this.
I'm taking you to the police.
Nobody's taking anybody anywhere.
Hate to inform you, buddy, but you've got a serious credibility issue.
Yeah, unstable psychopath who murdered his parents seeking to cleanse his demons away by avenging his brother's death?
Do you really think the cops are going to believe you?
They don't have to believe me.
They'll believe her.
I can't do it anymore.
I can't keep the secret.
Beth, you're being a little over emotional, don't you think, hm?
They're going to put us all away.
Especially you, Beth.
You were there.
We should have told the truth from the beginning.
C'mon, Beth.
See ya later, fellas.
Have a nice life.
You fucking cowards.
You oughta think twice.
Jesus, Ryan.
What are you doing?
Stay out of this, Nathan!
Showing your true colors, Ryan?
Shut the fuck up, asshole!
Why'd you take all your friends out, Ryan?
Afraid someone might crack?
Afraid someone might tell the truth about Brandon?
Don't fuck with me, man!
Jimmy was the first to crumble, wasn't he?
He couldn't take the guilt over Brandon's death so he was going to turn himself in, but you couldn't have that.
No, you had to killed Jimmy.
But then you had to kill, Blake, Jessie, Courtney!
One more word and I swear, I will fucking kill you!
Did you do it, Ryan?
Stay outta this, Nathan!
Ryan, did you do it?

What are you going to do when you get back to New York?
Probably find a job.
Good luck with that.
I told you everything I know, Sheriff.
You know when I came out here, I thought I'd get away from the big city, catch up on my fishing, drive the wife wherever the hell she wants.
Whoever did this, I hope they never step foot in Grace Arbor again.
