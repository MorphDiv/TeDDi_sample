Darling, you're still in your pajamas.
Here, let's get you dressed.

JJ wants to be more independent.
He wants to unbutton his own shirt today.
I tried to do it, and he bit my hand.
JJ... that's very resourceful.
All right, darling, you let me know when and if you need my help.
"Never." What?
"Can you just watch without..."
H-E -- "helping at all?"
Are you kidding?

Oh!

You're probably wondering why I asked you here.
You did?
I just came to take some pens.
Oh, what a happy coincidence!

Please, sit.
Um...

What summer hiatus?
Well, once school is out, the district won't pay for his services.
I'm afraid that you'll have to do without him.
Really?
What, like all summer?

He does not.

So I get my JJ back all summer!
Ooh, I could kiss you, you nervous little bird of a woman!
Come here!

[ Laughing ]
Oh, they warned me about the crazy.
No one prepared me for your heart.
**
What are you doing to our air?
Modern dance.
I'm telling a story with my body.
I've never felt so supple and expressive.
Cool.
Where would you like me to punch you?
My arm.
My gym grade is dragging down my GPA, so I'm doing Honors Modern Dance as my Phys.

Ray, I've done a pretty good job so far of staying out of your shame radius, but the splash zone on this one is just too big.
You're gonna bring me down with you.
Let me teach you how to run so you can stay in gym.
Thanks, Dylan.
You easily could've filmed that and used it to embarrass me.
I'm glad you decided to help me instead.
I played this totally wrong.
Oh!

Oh!
Tucked in shirt?

What's with the trying?

I'm stuck having dinner with a dad I barely know because our wives thought we might like each other.
Oh, darling, don't judge.
Maybe you'll like Dane.
You know his wife, Sarah.

Yeah, and if he's anything like her, he'll be dull as dirt with a... kind-of nice butt.
Okay, then.
Uh...

Please have a seat.
What's wrong?
You, Kenneth my friend -- You're going away... for the whole summer!

I was aware.
Kenneth:

I can't believe it, actually.
In two weeks time, it's the return of the May-Jay.
May-Jay?

And we're gonna need it for all our mother/son adventures.
Where are May-Jay?
Oh, they're at the beach on a bike with a sidecar.
What's that cool thing May-Jay are wearing?
Matching hats!
Oh!
[ Laughs ]
You don't have a more recent picture?
All right, two weeks, pal.

Dude, when are you gonna tell her you want to go to camp all summer?
[ Sighs ]
"There's never a good time, and she's so thirsty for summer."
[ Sighs ] Well, you're running out of time.
But good use of "thirsty."
So, what are you gonna say?
"No idea.
What do you think she'll buy?"
Yeah...

We're getting into a weird area.
There's some things that an aide is supposed to do, but providing tips on how to manipulate moms -- that's definitely not on the list.
But, you know, on an unrelated note,
I have this friend -- J.I.
Yeah, well, J.I., he wants to go to winter camp.
But his mom, Paya, won't let him go.
I think he should use Paya's vanity against her, make it seem like going to camp shows what a good mom she is.
[ Chuckles ]
That's just a story about my good friend J.I. and Paya.
It's clear I'm talking about y-- Yeah, okay.
We're fully booked tonight.
I'm sorry.

Oh, that actually works out 'cause I don't want to be here.
Jimmy!

Oh, Mr. Richmond!
I didn't realize he was with you.
Right this way.
Thank you, Tina.
Tony!
That's Tony.
He is the worst guy.
Let's see what we're dealing with.
We'll just run around the block.
Should I get some of that black stuff that sports people put under their eyes?
Maybe once you're a sports person.
**
Hey, let's throw down some apps.
Jimmy, what looks good to you?
How spicy is the eggplant dish?
Archie, get my man here an eggplant.
No spice -- He's got a delicate palette.
No, actually, I like spicy.
Archie, bring him the spiciest eggplant anyone has ever seen.
I want people to die making this eggplant.
Archie:

Anything else?
Nah.

Uh...

Does the band take requests?
For my Jimmy, yes, they do.
[ Playing "Blitzkrieg Bop" ]
[ Giggling ]
What is going on here?
How are you so connected?
I got a little juice here, I'm not gonna lie.
It's all about being a regular and knowing the right people.
Cool!

Dane noticed you eyeing the other table's souffl√©, so he had me bring you the last one.
[ High-pitched ] Dane?

**
Nice!
This is a good pace for a beginner like you.
Now let's slowly ease up to top speed.
Wh-Wh-What the --
**
[ Breathing heavily ] That was fun.
So, uh...

Wait a minute.
You were trying your hardest, weren't you?
[ Panting ]
Oh, my God!
I'm the fastest runner in the family.
I beat you, Dylan.
I'm a sports person!
It was amazing, Maya.
The flatbreads flowed like wine.
At a certain point, I was like, "Aah!
Enough with the flatbreads!

And Dane, he laughed at that.
Wow.
I haven't seen you this giddy since someone mistook you for their state assemblyman.
I just like Dane.
I told him next time we go out, I'd return the favor.
How?
You don't get special treatment anywhere.
A-Are you suggesting I don't have juice?
I -

Oh!

I have juice in other places.
No, y-y-you have no juice, darling.
[ Laughing ] You're juiceless.
Okay, I do have juice, and y could take a note or two from Dane on how to make a man feel good.
[ Alarm beeps ]
**
Morning, Ray!

Good.

Ready, set, go.
Is this because I beat you?
It was a fluke, and I demand a rematch.
Why would I give you a rematch?
I've never lost a race.
I'm retiring at the top of my game.
Let's see.
What do sports champions do after they hang it up?
Oh, God, they lose everything!
Oh, wait.
George Foreman turned out okay.
I'll just invent something.
Ray... running fast is my thing.
If you take this from me,
I can assure you, you will regret it.
You also assured me that you were the fastest DiMeo.
And... that turned out wrong.
Ooh, Sports Ray has some sass to him!
"The summer my mom taught me to.."
F-I-- "fish."
[ Voice breaking ] I remember that.
"The summer my mom taught me to"...
F-L-- "fly a kite."
Darling, it's so lovely.
I mean, I know Mother's Day isn't for a few days.
Is this my gift?
No?

'Cause you know I love my brunch.
I'd really like to have both things.
Aww, empty.
What will fill it?

You get that from me.

So, what do you want to do?
[ Sighs ]
"I'd like to go to camp."
Oh, they have those, do they?
Mother/son camps?
Looks a bit light on the mothers.
10 weeks?
No, wait.

Summer's going to be our time.
It always has been.
What's changed?
"What changed is me, thanks to the greatest mother in the world."
"Your..." L-O-V-E -- "love gave me the..."
S-T -- "strength to spread my wings."
Oh, that's what changed, is it?
"And it is on the wings of your love that I will soar."
[ Chuckles ]
Paya looks mad, J.I.
Where do you get the nerve helping my son manipulate me?
"I asked Kenneth to help me.
"I really want to go to..." C-- "camp."
It's why I've been working on my..."
B-U-T-T -- "butt."
Button, button.
It's our summer.
I mean, what?
Am I supposed to just spend it with someone else?
May-Ray?
That just sounds so stupid.
You can't just spring this on me, darling.
10 weeks is too long away from home, and I'm -

Maya, you are wrong on this one.
Are you still here?
'Cause this is between me and my son, okay?
No.

He wants to push himself.
And I know you want to protect him, but you need to get out of his way.
And I think I see this more clearly than you.
He's going.
**
Two pieces of good news -- one, your summer starts now.
Farewell.
And two...
I'll give you a little bit of a head start.
Before what?
Ten, nine... three...
Okay, bye.
[ School bell rings ]
Hello, Raymond.
Hello?
How 'bout those seven new planets they discovered in the TRAPPIST-1 galaxy?
What?
How do you know about that?
I'm smart now.
I'm taking your identity.
But I could give it back...

Mm.
All because I beat you.
Beet -- a red vegetable eaten by weirdoes.
Like looking in a mirror, ain't it?
I'm not racing you again.
Oh, I'll get my rematch!
What?
At whom are you looking?
[ Groans ] I hate being smart.
What is it?
JJ...
Oh, darling, I get the point.
You are capable.
But we can't do another button day yet, love.
It's too soon.
I know Kenneth is filling your mind with big ideas, but I do know you better.
And that camp looks lovely, but you've never spent a single night away from home.
Easy, JJ.
"Don't blame Kenneth for something I want to do."
Oh, come on, JJ.
As if I would ever do that.
[ Thud ] [ Gasps ] Are you okay?
Thanks a lot, Kenneth!
How are you doing, my brave man?
Good."Good."
Right, you meant JJ.

We made it here in record time, didn't we?
[ Smooches ] Practice makes perfect.
Right, we'll go and register.

On it.
Hey, sorry.
I will move my car as soon as I can.
No problem, Mr. DiMeo.

We'll keep it in front.

We'll throw in a wash, too.
Do I have juice... at the hospital?
[ Crystals' "And Then He Kissed Me" plays ]
How you doing?

Hey, Loretta!
Hey, you don't have to wait out here.
Right this way.
Man:

Hey, guys!

Orderly:

-Hey, Jimmy.

Jimmy:

There's the crew!

What's good Jimmy?

Kids are good?
Nurse:

Every time, you two.

-Jimmy!

-Hey, Jimmy!

Jimmy:

Come on, we're gonna take a shortcut.
[ Woman groaning ]
Uh...it's a boy.
Hey, good eye, Jimbo!
* ...wait to see him again
Loretta, you're the best.

DiMeo's in the house!
Hey, Jimmy!
Jimmy!
Nurse:

Doctors.
All:

Nurse #2:

-Jimmy!

Unh-unh!

Hey, Lucy, is 222 open?

Kick that amputee out of 222!
* And then he kissed me
Anything you need, Jimmy, just let me know.
* And then he kissed me Mr. DiMeo!
* And then he kissed me
Something to drink, Mr. DiMeo?
Juice.
Dylan:

Who do you think could make it out there faster?
You.
But we ain't gonna find out.
JJ, buddy!
Thank God!

[ Laughs nervously ]
You look good.
Real -- real good.
[ Exhales sharply ]
[ Sighs ] Rookie.
I'm sorry.

And the wires -- What's with the wires?
[ Voice breaking ] What did they hook him up to?

They control the television, Kenneth.
JJ's gonna be just fine.
He dislocated his kneecap.
We're just waiting to see if he's gonna need surgery.
He had the same procedure done on his other knee a few years ago.
[ Knocking ] Oh, kids?
Do you want to grab a soda?
How you holding up, JJ?
Let's take a look.
[ Winces ]
You're killing him!

Jimmy:

Thank you so much.

So, we are gonna have to perform a lateral release.
I'll talk to the surgeons.
You know the drill.
You're gonna do great.
**
Oh, darling.
It's all right.
"Forget"...

You were right.
I can't do it."
Darling, we'll talk about it later.
Just...
You rest now.
"No, it's fine.
I can't undo a button without putting myself in the hospital."
Hey, hey, hey.
I am connected here.
Do you want to name a baby?
**
I am so sorry.

Don't send him to camp.
Protect that child!
Lock him away.
I judge you for letting me near him!
You don't know me!

Some groundskeeper you met off the street?
Yeah, I need you to talk to JJ.
Don't make me talk to him!
I'll fall on him!
Get your head on straight, and explain to him he is going to camp.
What?
He just told me that I was right, he can't do it.
Now, I am not the person who convinces him what he cannot do.
So, that's not taken?
I-I can be that person.
It's his time to soar.

He used to listen to everything I said, but, for whatever reason, you have that now.
You've come to matter.
Get ready to matter.
**
Wasn't this nice?
I know we're fighting, but it's important for us to be here for each other in times like this.
Yeah, it's so much more important than that stupid stuff about who's faster.
Totally.
And JJ's gonna be fine.
Surgeries like this are old hat to him.
I know.
And I have to admit, one thing that I like is how JJ's always so nice to me after surgery.
Oh, yeah?

It's a tender moment between brothers.
The fact that it's aided by pain killers only subtracts from it slightly.
Not sure if you've noticed, but I'm always sure that I'm the very first person that he sees after he gets out of surgery so I can hog up all that sweet JJ love.
I have noticed that.
It's almost like you'd do anything to make sure you were the first person by his side.
What are you getting at?
'Kay, not proud of it, but I kind of turned your ringer off.
And JJ kinda went into surgery and is getting out... kind of now.

JJ, I'm coming for you!
Let's make it official!

You're good at hurdling, too?
**
Yes!
[ Breathing heavily ] You won, fair and square.
Go ahead.
I deserve it.
You were pretty fast.
Like the sun revolving around... whatever.
Hey!
You did great!
[ Chuckles ]
You, uh...

L-O-- "Love"?
Yeah?
Don't mind if I do.
[ Chuckles ]
Ahh.
Brightening some kid in the hospital's day.
I really am a star athlete.
[ Knock at door ]
Hey, buddy.
You feeling okay?
So, your mom told me you decided not to go to camp.
"It's too much.
I'm not ready."
Oh, yeah, but you were so excited about going to camp.
What about challenging yourself?
"Why are you not..."
L-O-O-- "looking at me?"
Whaaat?
I gotta be looking at you all the time?
Like you're so great.
I just happen to be looking at other things, like that wall, or -- or -- or that TV.
Oh, boy.
So many wires in my little buddy.
[ Clatters ]
Oi!
Oh!
That floor's slippery.

[ Door closes ]
Okay, listen.
All that nice stuff that
Kenneth said about me before as a mum,
I don't know how much of that came from you, but it's spot on.
I am good.
I'm damn good.
But it's only because
I am determined to be the mother that you deserve.
You -

You inspire me, darling.
You always have.
More so now you're growing up... taking risks.
Darling... you will do whatever you want in your heart.
Your body doesn't get a say.
If you don't want to go to camp,
I suppose we could have a fun summer.
I mean, who knows?
I haven't really given it much thought.
But if you do want to go, we'll get you ready.
Together.
Believe that.
**
It's been a long day.
Sleep on it.
What?

Damn right, you're going.
Dane:

Jimmy:

We're taking a right.

No peeking.
I'm not peeking.
And...open!
I know what you're thinking.
How did I get a room this nice on such short notice?
I've got some juice.
Normally, these would just be a gift for a new mother.
Tonight, they're a gift for my new friend.
So, we're eating steaks that were intended for mothers who had just given birth.
Yeah.

We're losing him.

Oh, ho, ho!

Very nice.

Clear!
