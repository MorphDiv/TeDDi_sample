[animals roaring]
Our team managed to cure the animals, but at a terrible cost.
In an attempt to return the planet to the animals, a secretive group called The Shepherds released a gas that sterilized all of humanity.
And then, lab-made creatures... called hybrids...
Devastated the West Coast.
So a massive barrier was constructed to protect the rest of North America... but new breeds have started to appear, [squawking] so we reassembled our team.
We battle on many fronts, searching for a cure to sterility while racing to stop the hybrids and a brutal terrorist with a plan to end the human race.
The fight for mankind's survival has just begun.
[snarling]
Previously on Zoo...
Abigail Westbrook.
Who also happens to be my sister.
Let's talk about Clementine Lewis.
Please, God, please.
[heartbeat pounding]
There, stop.
That's Abigail.
Two new species pop up in the span of 48 hours?
And Abigail is at the center of it.
Well, this is more than a little weird.
And that thing just started moving.
[screeching]
_ [hybrids screeching]
[whirring rapidly]
I'm just gonna assume there's no "off" switch.
That can't be good.
Is anyone else freaked out by the fact that they're flying?
Come on!
[hybrids roaring, screeching]
Oh!
Whoa!
Chopper out back.
Let's go!
Come on!
Whoa, whoa!
Come on, let's go!
We're tracking a woman who bombed my refugee camp in Portland.
But more importantly, where the hell you been?
Hibernated in a healing tank.
Rescued by a fake daughter.
Shot real daughter.
Found an evil Shepherd device inside my skull.
Brain surgery with a farm animal.
Freaky new memories brought me here.
And for us, that's a Tuesday.
[hybrid crashing]
[squawking]
Plan B. Let's get to the truck.
[hybrids screeching]
[hybrids crashing]
Leaving so soon, brother?
Gonna miss the big show.
That doesn't sound right.
That's not good.
Home sweet plane.
She's gonna need some serious TLC if she's gonna be road worthy any time soon.
Looks like we snagged a passenger.
Okay, we're wheels up in five.
Look, I know it's cool to hate me right now, but I really am sorry.
Just save it.
Right now we need to figure out what those hybrids are doing.
[explosion]
Uh, you might want to speed up that takeoff time.
_
You heard what Leanne said.
Clem is a thief.
I know this is hard... but if turning her over to Reiden gets us Isaac back, that's a deal we should be willing to take.
We only know what Leanne told us.
Why believe a woman who stole our son?
You can't be serious about this.
Abe, we are talking about Mitch's daughter.
How could we ever do that?
You can't just sit there and say nothing.
Not now.
You guys know what you want?
Or do you need a little more time?
The, uh, new hybrid species or exploding volcanoes?
Do we know that the new hybrids caused the volcano to explode?
That ringing a bell with anybody?
So, uh, this is who we are looking for.
Her name is Abigail Westbrook and so far, tracking her down has been, uh...
Yeah, whatever that device was, it was attracting the hybrids to its location like a, uh... like a...
Beacon.
Yeah, that.
Yeah, so more than one disc means more than one beacon.
The more beacons that she activates, the more the hybrids will spread.
But no one's ever seen a flying hybrid.
Where are they spreading from?
Here's what happened after she activated that beacon.
Fortunately, inside the hybrid zone.
Abe said that these things can reproduce asexually from a single drop of blood, which means exponential growth once they get to a new area.
Now that we have flying hybrids, this is what would happen if she got a beacon east of the barrier.
[computer trilling rapidly]
And this is what it would look like if she got a beacon all the way to Europe.
So, how long till Hybri-geddon?
[sighs] Based on these calculations... 90 days.
[computer trilling rapidly]
Here with Leanne Ducovny, the Reiden CEO responsible for the controversial abductions of thousands of children from their homes.
Since then, you've had protestors outside your office every day and mounting pressure to allow the government access to your facilities.
These are people's children.
Don't you think some transparency could help?
Let me stop you right there.
First of all, "the youth rejuvenation program"
isn't a punishment, it's a promise.
It's a promise to solve sterility.
So, you see yourself as the savior of mankind?
[video rewinds]
Savior of mankind.
[video rewinds]
Savior of mankind.
So, been dying to ask you guys, how was my funeral?
Very tasteful.
What song did you guys pick?
"Wind Beneath My Wings"?
"Who Let the Dogs Out."
Yeah, that was the last time we were all together.
After you were gone, things just, um... weren't the same.
Well, a couple years later, a regular life just wasn't really an option for me, so...
Yeah, circumstances were, um...
I... had to get away.
Plus, people out there need help.
May as well be me.
Well, at least now you won't have to play bumbling-but-effective hero on your own.
"Who Let the Dogs Out," that's very good.
Wait, Jackson.
So am I.
Biology of this hybrid is nuts.
Look at the size of that ear canal.
It's incredibly similar to Marsupialia that use echolocation.
Abe was onto something with that unique hybrid frequency.
They're using it to communicate.
So... if we can reverse engineer the frequency, maybe we can find one of those beacons, track down Abigail, right?
Stop Abigail, we stop the hybrid spread.
That thing is really cool.
Which is gross enough, but why-why is he studying hybrids?
He's not a sex doctor, he's a reproductive endocrinologist.
He thinks that hybrids are the key to solving the world's sterility.
Yeah, there's a lot going on.
I feel like it might be a good time to bring...
That's a lot of words to say that you need Abe's help.
I'm post-tank Mitch.
Let's go to Michigan, find a sex doctor.
_ [sirens wailing, people shouting]
These protesters, they want their kids back.
And if it means burning down an entire city block, they'll do it.
Wake up, Cal.
Flying hybrids are a reality, and sterility isn't magically going away.
With these twin threats, human beings could be an endangered species in ten years.
You want to save mankind, you have to make tough decisions.
We need to earn the trust of the public.
The board and I are unanimous.
You will allow a full and complete inspection by government officials.
There are dangers here that you don't understand.
I don't care, Leanne!
You make this work.
And if you can't, we'll find someone who can.
[door opens, closes]
Should I set up the inspection appointments?
Yes.
And double security outside.
Revoke all non-essential keycards.
Okay.
A little bit stressed?
Yeah, not all family reunions are pleasant.
Are you talking about what happened with Jackson earlier?
What was that all about?
It's a long story.
Try me.
That's not that big.
Well, he didn't go because he wanted to.
When my book was published,
I gave everyone pseudonyms to protect them.
And it worked for everyone but Jackson.
Didn't matter that my book said he was innocent, he's the son of Robert Oz.
And the Shepherd hunters wanted blood.
Okay.
So that is sort of big.
But wait, don't you work for the Shepherd hunters?
I work with them, when it serves me.
[phone chimes]
_
Yes, everything's fine.
[turbine whirring] [tires screech]
What do we tell them when they start asking about Isaac?
If Mitch were to find out about Clem...
Just let me do the talking.
Dariela!
Ha, ha, rafiki.
[laughs] [dog barking]
Who's this?
Pizza.
My friend.
It's been so long.
How is Isaac?
That hybrid sample that you needed, Abe,
I wasn't able to track another one down.
Abe, if Isaac needs any help, you know that we will do whatever it takes.
It's complicated.
I'll fill you in later, I promise.
Just stay with me on this one.
I'll let you two catch up.
Come on, Pizza.
[Pizza barks]
You being on this side of the barrier is dangerous.
Yeah, but I had to.
Why would leave that protection you had?
You had a life there.
You were seeing someone.
Tessa, yes?
I'm sorry, rafiki.
Hey, it's okay.
I had to rip the Band-Aid off at some point.
Couldn't fight this war from the hybrid zone forever.
Now come on, let's get the band back together, huh?
[laughs]
Ah...
There he is.
Our very own Mr. Spock.
Like in part two when he dies, and then part three...
Yeah, I-I get the reference.
You know, when I found out that you let Max raise my kid,
I almost went back into the grave... [laughs, stammers]
I can't... [laughs]
Even a pack of wild razorbacks couldn't keep you down.
What did you do, fight them off with your bare hands?
No, but I like that version better.
Dr. Kenyatta.
Detective.
Dariela.
It's great to see you.
Jamie.
I-I'm sorry I kind of ditched you guys the other day.
That would be one way of putting it.
I couldn't risk your lives.
You have a son.
I saw the news about Reiden taking the kids.
Is Isaac...?
Great.
Hey, can you toss me that 'lectro wrench?
Didn't realize you were into cars.
Guilty as charged.
Total gearhead.
Angry, sad, lonely.
Whatever I was feeling growing up, cars were always there.
I guess, I guess they helped me make sense of things.
And given the current state of the world,
I could use a little bit of that right now.
Couldn't we all?
Socket driver?
Thanks.
So what's it like being back with your dead dad?
What's it like being one of the last mothers on Earth?
[exhales]
Weird.
It's been a tough couple years since we all saw each other.
I know you haven't had an easy go, either.
That's true, but... but everybody's different.
You never know how you're gonna react in a tough situation until you're in it, you know?
[tool whirring]
We all have our regrets.
Done things we're not proud of.
We all have our secrets.
All my regrets are behind me.
Well, sometimes our regrets catch up to us.
[tool whirring]
And once it bounces back, we should, theoretically, get the location of the next beacon.
[computer beeping]
It may take a while to get an answer.
This hybrid frequency is like nothing I've ever seen.
So we could be looking at a highly evolved form of communication, similar to how octopuses use their changing colors as mating signals, right?
It's recently been proven that their changes in color are actually a complex language.
Great.
Even better.
But it could also be similar to, uh, the groupthink of honey bee colonies.
The prevailing theory now is that bees use myriad odors as communication.
Did the entire scientific world just implode while I was gone?
I mean, the big ones are still around right?
The second law of thermodynamics?
It's more like second guideline.
Theory of relativity?
It's still a theory.
That was cute.
What about gravity?
Gravity still a thing?
Define "thing."
I know that's still a thing.
Humanity will flourish again.
This guy has supracoracoideus muscles that look just like the ones in hummingbirds.
Well, that makes sense, for flight.
Yeah, but look.
He's got an entirely extra set.
Now, these things expand and contract at super high speeds, but they're totally unnecessary for the way this guy flies.
Wait a minute, you said these new hybrids were diving under the ground in Mexico, correct?
Well, what if they used these new muscles underground, en masse?
If there were enough of them, uh... compound vibrations could potentially cause massive acoustic fluidization, which would trigger volcanic eruptions...
Which did trigger a volcanic eruption.
And Abigail can summon them at will.
[alert beeping]
We found a beacon.
It's moving.
She must be transporting it.
This barrier's been protecting the East Coast.
There are people this side of it who haven't even seen a hybrid before.
Yeah, well, if these things fly over those barriers, they're gonna see a whole lot of them.
As they get eaten.
If the hybrids get into the city, the East Coast could fall in days.
We have to go there.
_
Who's The Falcon?
Yeah, listen, I'm already aware of your whole,
"he puts the lotion in the basket" situation downstairs, so... it's a little late to save your reputation.
Okay.
There are two Shepherds that I haven't been able to track down.
One is Mr. Duncan, who is a ghost, and the other is The Falcon, who is apparently ascended to the upper echelons of power.
But, after all this time,
The Falcon has remained out of reach.
Is that a Tom Collins?
Since when is that your drink?
Well, a few things have changed in the last ten years.
Yeah, I noticed.
What happened to you?
I guess I just always thought that if...
I could tell people the truth, that things would change.
But it didn't stop Reiden from killing people, didn't stop the Shepherds.
The same people that were in power then are in power now.
And I got really sick of not seeing justice done.
So, I went out and did it myself.
All right, I'm still adjusting to the new super Jamie.
I mean, for you it's been ten years.
I took a nap, you cracked my skull open.
How is that, by the way?
To be honest, I don't know.
But, um, this quest thing that you're on, it just seems a little dark for you.
Well, I guess there... wasn't a whole lot to look forward to.
How about now?
♪
Earlier, what you said about handing over Clem to Reiden,
I know this is about Isaac, but now that we're all back together, seeing her, we have to find another way.
There may not be another way and we're running out of time.
We just need time to think.
Not making a decision is still a decision.
If we let this deadline pass, that choice is gone and we lose our only chance of getting Isaac back.
[distant siren wailing]
World hangs over an abyss and yet you protect order.
Imagine you find it honorable.
Band playing on while the Titanic sinks into the cold depths.
But honor is a lie you tell yourself.
I think you're afraid.
I think you enforce that order because you don't know what else to do.
Suppose it gave you purpose.
Lucky for me... it also gave you this.
Well, that was fun.
Can we go do it in the cockpit now?
After I converted the plane to tablet,
I had the cockpit turned into a breakfast nook.
Can you say that again, please, but just slower?
Um, rain check.
I got to go do something first.
I know I put a target on your back for the last five years, and you're angry and it's warranted.
I can keep apologizing.
This isn't about me, Jamie.
Abe sacrificed everything for me, to keep my safe.
His marriage, his job, his son.
And I will never be able to repay him for that.
So, I just hope that that best-seller list was worth it.
[Jackson sighs]
Okay, what are we doing?
The coward son of Oz.
Talk again and I cut your eye out.
This is what I've been protecting you from.
What are you talking about?
Protecting me?
Why do the Shepherd hunters think you're in Asia?
Who scrubbed your photo from every server on the planet?
The only thing keeping you on this side of a cage or worse is me.
That's very generous of you.
Except you're the reason that they're chasing me in the first place.
You have a choice to make.
If I am the grand villain of your life, you can shoot me.
Or you can shoot one of the men who tried to end the world.
Or... you can accept that what's past is past and move on with whatever future we all have left.
Hey, Mitch.
Did you know that Jamie is keeping Mansdale prisoner in the bottom of this plane?
Yeah.
And, on the one hand, it is dark and horrible.
On the other hand, the Shepherds did almost wipe out all of humanity.
Oh, and also the whole vigilante thing is kind of working for me.
Mitch, this is not a joke.
We have to keep an eye on her.
Okay.
[phone beeps]
This is Dariela Kenyatta.
Have you considered my offer?
By day's end, you'll have Clementine Lewis.
Perfect.
And by day's end, you'll be holding your son again.
[phone vibrates, beeps]
_ [protestors shouting]
[protestors shouting]
I got the officer coming through.
[protestors shouting]
I've had luck blocking the hybrid signal before, but this beacon is a whole different beast.
Okay, so we're gonna work on a solution here and we'll talk you through it once you find the beacon.
Wrap it in tinfoil.
Use the copper wire to...
Yeah, I got it.
Make it all electric-y.
[horns blaring] [tires screech] [tracker beeping]
Okay, we're close.
That thing's pretty slick.
Dr. Abe just whipped it up in a matter of minutes.
You must be impressed.
Well, it's not that amazing.
You jealous of somebody out-sciencing you?
No.
Well, maybe.
Anyway, he's got a ten-year jump on me.
This way.
Going somewhere?
After all my tune-ups, it turns out the truck is just missing a fuel cell relay.
It must've come loose when we were getting out of that cabin.
Luckily, I know a few good garages in the area.
I don't think you should go out by yourself.
Let me come with you.
[chuckles] I appreciate the concern, but...
I think I got this one.
[siren wails]
Abigail's setting off a beacon inside Reiden Tower?
What does she want with Reiden?
I don't know.
But somehow, we got to get past these cops.
Anybody got a plan for that?
♪
Coming through.
I need you on your best behavior in there.
What, you don't trust me?
These two are with me.
Abigail's gunning for Reiden Tower.
So whatever you're cooking up, better make it fast.
Yes, we're on it.
Although it seems backwards,
We're saving New York City and, perhaps the entire East Coast.
All right, so, look, this is hopefully what Mitch has access to inside Reiden.
Lemon juice?
It's a good conductor, but why do we have so much?
Apparently, Jamie makes a mean Tom Collins.
It's nice to know she had so much time for hobbies in between destroying lives.
[sniffs]
You lost a lot because of her, Abe.
You need to stop using me as an excuse.
Jamie was just doing what she thought was right.
Despite everything that's happened,
I'm glad we're back together.
No matter how messy it gets, we're still a family.
You, me, Jamie, Dariela, Mitch...
Clem.
What's going on, Abe?
What aren't you telling me?
I need to find Dariela.
Abe, we need to talk.
I'll be right back.
Just, uh, use the electrical tape and the lemon juice, okay?
Abe, there's something I need to tell you.
No, no.
You were right.
There's no way we can do this.
No matter how much we want Isaac back, we cannot betray Mitch and Clem.
[sighs]
No matter what happens between us,
Isaac is still our son.
And we will find a way to get him back.
Together.
Okay?
[alarm blaring]
Split up.
When we find Abigail, let me do my job.
I don't need you going all Kill Bill on her ass.
Jamie?
[alarm blaring]
Logan, I got her.
Southwest staircase, heading up.
Mitch.
How do you know my name?
That's the least of the things I know.
Okay, wait.
Uh, b-before you do that, let's, uh, let's talk this out.
[device whirring]
You're bound by the edicts of the old order, but I'm going beyond.
Beyond the constraints of this planet, beyond the regime of humanity, beyond the concept of life as you understand it.
I'm going to create a new world.
And I'm bringing my hybrids with me.
So you're like an evil queen in a cartoon movie.
You have a choice, Mitch.
Between the old dead way and the beyond.
It's time to make it.
Wait, wait, no, no, no!
No, don't... ah!
Logan, she activated the device.
[tires screech]
[engine turns off]
[grunts] [tires screech]
[line ringing]
We got her.
Take her to the drop.
Once Leanne has her, I'll send payment.
[phone beeps]
_
I'm ready for you.
Uh, guys?
Either this thing's broken or there's a swarm of hybrids heading for us.
[hybrids screeching]
[screeching in distance]
[grunts]
Don't know what I'm gonna do about the lemon juice.
We need to leave now.
Little busy.
I lost them both.
Hybrids have overrun the building.
We need to leave now.
We're either gonna need a whole lot of lemon juice or a whole new plan.
Guess that means new plan.
[muffled screeching]
Wh-What?
It was worth a shot.
Was it?
[banging, screeching continues]
I have another idea.
[gas hisses]
Okay, we're good.
What do you think, middle of the Atlantic?
Yeah.
Let's see if these turkeys can swim.
It's actually working.
[screeching]
try firing your weapon at bad guys instead of me.
Maybe you'll lose less suspects.
Thank you.
[protestors shouting]
The drone's losing altitude.
Must be the battery.
Can't handle the extra weight of the beacon.
Well, if we, if we don't do something fast, it's not gonna make it to the ocean.
Do you think Jamie still has that harpoon crossbow on the plane?
[camera snapping]
What the hell happened?
She got popped while the building was on lockdown.
Do you have any suspects?
Yeah, we got one in custody.
She asked for you.
She's-she's with us.
No, it's not.
I did it.
And I would do it again.
She was The Falcon.
[handcuffs rattle]
You have the right to remain silent.
Is that really necessary?
[phone ringing]
Still no answer.
What the hell's going on?
Reiden seems to be a no-show.
And my black market contact says that there is a bounty out on her for quadruple what Dariela was paying, so...
I think we can make some money here.
Let's do this.
[air rushing] [alarm blaring]
The drone is losing altitude.
Just a little lower.
We need to fly below the drone.
Don't fire until the last minute.
Okay.
[hybrids screeching]
Wait.
Wait!
There's the drone.
Now!
[line snaps]
Aah!
[grunting]
We got you!
[loud screeching]
We got bigger problems.
