It must be over 400 years old.
At least 90% purity.
Soft to the touch.
It was only a matter of time.
This is going to be the biggest haul of gold artifacts in the history of Adams exploration.
The company can give it to you.
The company cannot pay me what I want.
I'm not going to do this because I loved your father.
This is your release form.
Got any place to go?
Jack.
I'm an archeologist.
Hell of a funeral procession.
The king is dead.
Long live the king.
It's still up in the air, Matthew.
Our business is to salvage and recovery of treasure.
It looks bad if a hundred thousand gold coins go missing.
And the killing is in the press.
We won't have a ceo until this is resolved.
A king is a king from birth.
The coronation is just a formality.
My sister doesn't have the stomach for this job.
She's just a scientist.
She has to be placated somehow.
Your father gave her a journal with enough documents to blow this whole thing to bits.
No, she'd never hurt this company.
She doesn't have the balls to use a nuclear option like that.
This fight will take place in the boardroom...
And I own the boardroom.
He spends his whole life pillaging, pirating, only to get a guilty conscience at the end.
Still, I think he's right, and when I run this company, I'm gonna run it clean.
Remember, be diplomatic.
Offer her cfo, head of research... a carrot.
I've been diplomatic with her my entire life.
It's time she learns that there's a new balance of power.
You've got some fucking nerve calling me today after your screwed everything up.
My interns could've done a better job.
All I know is that you failed to stop them.
I looked down the barrel of a loaded gun.
I almost got shot execution style by a man who used to come to our family barbecue.
So pardon me all the fucking hell, but I'm not in the mood for a teachable moment from you right now.
My sympathies, mave, truly, but I'm ceo now, and you just cost our company a billion dollars.
Your father implemented security measures.
Because of today, we had to vote for an interim ceo.
And I'm sorry for your ordeal, truly.
Oh, go to hell, both of you.
I'll fight you in the boardroom and win.
See you at the fucking meeting.
She'll fall in line.
It's the beginning of a new era.
If it's one thing I've learned from your father, never underestimate your own family.
A leader has to show strength.
When sir Francis Drake was sent to raid the Spanish, his co-commander Thomas dowdy tried to take control.
Thomas dowdy was a gentleman, a scholar, and a war hero.
But Drake was the captain, and one of them was beheaded the next day.
I understand your long-standing fascination with sir Francis Drake, but I'm not sure what the same logic applies to 21st century Hong Kong.
My sister is not gonna get the votes, because she spent there entire life reading about history, and I've spent my entire life understanding it.
An aika stone?
Yeah.
This is mesopotamian.
The term is actually akkadian, but, uh...
Look, are you going to be doing this here or back at your appraisal office?
You're selling it?
Well, you're from the university, right?
I'm sorry, I just wanna get this over with.
I think there's been a misunderstanding.
I came here to find you.
You're Jack riordan, right?
You ever seen one of these?
It's a gaudens double eagle, last gold coin circulated by the U.S. mint.
Beautiful.
It was worth $20 in 1933.
Wanna guess how much it's worth now?
Look, I don't know what got you out of your comfy little office, but I'm not interested.
I need you to steal something for me.
Excuse me?
I don't know who you think I am, but I am not your guy.
I think you are, Jack.
The biggest find in modern history.
100,000 gold coins touched by the inca themselves.
More gold than king tut's tomb.
More gold then 10,000 of these combined.
You were the best, Jack.
You found things we didn't even know existed, let alone were still preserved.
Isn't that what all this stuff is about?
Just stop.
I am not just talking about the thrill of the find.
I'm talking about history.
500 years of blood, sand, and gold in one goddamn chest.
Look, I don't know what you think I did or was, but it's over.
The last treasure hunt i went on, the only thing I found was the back of a jail cell.
I'm out.
Everyone has a price.
$750,000...
That's how much is worth now.
We should be through this turbulence in about 20 minutes, and in Western Sahara in about three hours.
Don't tell me you're afraid to fly.
You and my brother Matthew...
The only thing keeping him from monopolizing the company jet.
Once our dad died, he went straight for the fucking throne.
Why are you afraid to fly?
Sorry, are you going to be talking this whole time?
I'm certainly paying you enough.
We have one week to find this, Jack, before the board meeting.
This is the last place Henry was before they took off with everything.
Well, it's your money.
Well, Henry has a gun, in case you've forgotten.
We're going through the local authorities on this one, Jack.
Hurry up.
We're supposed to be meeting the police chief.
I lived with him here for months.
Looks like a dead end.
I have a few more questions for farouk.
I'll be outside.
It's not a problem.
Why are you following us?
Jack, let him go.
Hey!
Your sister is back in Western Sahara.
She thinks she's a detective.
I told her the authorities were handling it.
Well, the only thing mave is gonna miss is a board meeting.
Whatever she's doing, it's costing us a fortune.
Cut her off.
Freeze her accounts.
If she has no money, she has to come home.
Goddamn it.
It's a good thing you already paid me.
Why don't you have a drink?
Send the plane back.
Matthew wants to parade me in front of the board as a goddamn failure.
I've got nothing.
Look at the last number dialed.
Hong Kong.
Haven't heard a lot of mandarin around here, have you?
A billion dollars of gold is worth nothing until you sell it.
Go to the biggest black market in the world, find your gold, steal it back.
That's what I paid you $750,000 to tell me?
My accounts are frozen, Jack.
Look, we do this my way.
And this black market of gold is in Hong Kong?
The middle of the middle east.
Golden city.
The company is recalling us.
Well, I guess you gotta choose, mave.
One thing, we do this, I'm gonna need a gun.
I just go word the plane is back and your sister wasn't on it.
Well, she's making it easy for us then.
I guess she'll be missing the meeting.
First we're gonna meet with my friend sheik Ali.
He's a bit of an eccentric, but he's the biggest artifact collector in all of Dubai.
Jack, habibi.
Let me get a good look at you.
I figured it was only a matter of time before you came calling.
You've arrived just in time.
There's a sitting room inside for your wife.
There's only 20 of these in the world.
I won him in a poker tournament in marrakesh.
Impressive, eh?
Come.
So, how's business?
Governments are ambushing any new digs, any findings.
They're suing private companies for their treasure because of this new salvage law.
Well, I guess I got out at a good time.
Yeah, which is why I'm surprised you're even back here.
You know ever since that whole black swan investigation
I haven't bought anything for my trophy room.
Well, there's word of a gentleman from Hong Kong, the only one is stupid enough to pay cash for black market items.
They say he speaks Japanese.
Look at these birds.
Accipiters, they always kill their prey the same way...
Ambush.
You can never be too careful when dealing with the sovereign nations of the world.
I'm throwing a party, and anyone in who's anyone this side of the Gulf will be there.
You must come.
I'm not sure if that'll be a good idea.
I know your weakness.
I'm fine here.
Well, suit yourself.
I'm so glad my money is going to good use.
Are you here to talk history or money?
Because you know i won't talk about one of them.
History.
When I first met this young man, Jack was quite impressive, both in his research and in his pursuit of fellow colleagues.
We're not here to talk about the past, Charlotte.
We're here to talk about the future.
The past is all around us, Jack.
That was always your problem, both as student and as an archeologist.
Always the vision, never the Patience.
Well, I guess that's why I'm here.
I'm trying to correct that.
So what's the treasure this time?
We're looking for late 16th century, elizabethan.
I heard rumors about this.
I'm not so out of the loop, Jack.
Whitman's red books, top shelf.
I thought your boy was lost to me.
Because of prison?
Because he forgot the golden rule of archeology.
The work is about the history, not the person who uncovers it.
But Jack was so easily distracted, both by fortune and glory.
That can come later.
But you seem to bring something out in him.
I don't know about that.
Got it.
A column of gold as far as the eye can see, minted coins, bracelets, and jewels all taken from the tombs of the inca.
The mysterious haul of Drake.
Even my nephew today brings his little prospect pan to the beach in search of Drake's gold.
The gold we found was incan.
It had an engraving, a Spanish symbol.
Something like this.
Oh, my god.
It is Drake's.
But why would it be in Western Sahara?
Because he was taking it to the canary islands.
He knew the Spanish would search his ship.
Knowing that, he leaves his treasure across the channel in the Western Sahara, hoping to come back for it.
And that's where I found it.
You think it's okay to come here like this?
You know I hate that.
You're just wasting my fucking time.
You understand?
You understand me?
Oh, goddamn it.
What did I tell you about no calls?
Tell me.
Don't tell me she's in Dubai.
What does she know?
The last thing we need right now is my sister blowing this whole thing out of the water.
Hey.
What's your name?
Xiu.
You work out of town?
So why are we changing hotels?
In this city, every hotel, every concierge, every driver, they know what you're doing and when you're doing it.
Like that car that's been tailing us since the airport.
Hi.
The only thing they had was a one-bedroom.
They're sending a roll-out couch for you.
You give them my name?
You wanna tell me why you've been following us?
Get his car.
What the hell was that back there?
His name is assam.
Look, last place he went on his GPS.
The gold souk.
Largest gold market in the world.
Seems like a good place to start.
I told you, we can't trust anyone in this city, especially your driver.
Which is now me.
Who is assam?
Who are you working for?
Japanese.
Didn't I tell you to stay in the car?
Just give me the keys.
Give me the keys.
Come on.
Someone out there is purchasing large amounts of black market artifacts, and all we know is he's Japanese.
Our friend back there was gonna tell us more when you decided...
I was just trying to help.
If I had known what was going on, it wouldn't have happened.
You know why I work alone?
No accomplices.
Well, you could use one.
You might need this tonight at the sheik's.
Is that for warmth or are we going undercover?
Well, I thought we'd make an entrance, but I like how quickly you've embraced the life of crime.
I learned from the best.
They have valets for this thing?
They have valets for everything.
Yeah, they'll be here in five minutes.
These are the high rollers on the black market of gold.
Twenty billion for just this compound.
Drug dealers, murderers, warlords, terrorists...
Are you trying to impress me?
Is it working?
Hopefully your entrance will be the only surprise of the evening.
Is our Japanese buyer coming tonight?
Is that mave?
I lost my fear of flying the day I became ceo.
If you'll excuse us.
Fuck!
Can I help you?
I thought I knew all of my sister's friends.
We're not friends.
No, you're not exactly her type.
Tracking my stolen treasure?
You and every law enforcement agency in the world.
So why the hell did she hire you?
Well, I guess because i can do things that law enforcement agencies can't.
That's a beautiful bracelet.
Yeah.
Can I look at it?
Fine.
This isn't yours.
Give it to me.
You got it from my brother, didn't you?
Let's just talk to him about it, okay?
What?
What's my sister paying you?
Less?
Really scraping the bottom of the barrel.
I'll give you $2 million to walk away right now.
And what do you get out of it?
You know how this business works.
It's not about digging for treasure anymore.
It's claiming rights and lawsuits and government oversight.
It's making the connections necessary so that companies like mine ensure a profit.
Can you honestly see my sister handling any of that as ceo?
She has a gentle heart.
And that's why I was so saddened by the loss of Drake's gold.
It would've been a real feather in the cap, you know?
His ship was "the golden hind."
Mine is a red Mercedes sis.
I guess the thing that you're forgetting now is that Drake went insane and beheaded his best friend.
Oh, you're speaking of Thomas dowdy.
Take my money.
It's 500 hundred years...
Not a good time.
Way to get us kicked out.
Uh, good thing that party sucked.
No, seriously, who cares he took back his motorcycle?
Wasn't that great of a bike, anyway.
Oh, and that was good work, too.
Uh, he's a maniac.
You know he thinks he's the second coming of Drake?
I found the treasure.
This is hand plated.
Incan.
Wait, the sheik had this?
No, my brother's whore did.
She took it from him.
But that means that Matthew has the gold.
Second coming of Drake.
We're chasing my goddamn brother.
Shit.
I kinda like it when everything is out in the open.
She knows I know, and now we're just gonna have to fix it.
Matthew, you're drunk.
Hey, this is your sister we're talking about.
Matthew, this is not how we do things.
Would you rather we were both in jail?
I'd rather you come clean about this.
Report everything found, that way the company can get back to what it does best, finding ancient ruins.
And what?
Every country within 2,000 miles slowly claws our findings back.
Fuck no.
What I if I find, I keep.
There are legal means to handle this, Matthew.
It takes time, yes, but it's the best thing for this company.
Would you spare me your fucking morality and legal issues, Ernest?
You lawyers all think the same.
But you know the shit this company's been doing for years to stay afloat.
You're a part of it, it's politics.
Okay, what do you want?
I want mave taken out.
And I'm gonna need a clean-up over here.
We're gonna something a little different tonight.
I'm not gonna fuck you.
I'm not gonna even touch you.
Have you heard of Thomas dowdy?
Nobody studies history anymore.
Steal from me?
You all right?
You haven't said anything in a while.
I have to use the journal.
The journal?
My father willed me a journal.
I haven't read it.
Allegedly, it exposes every sin
Adams exploration ever committed.
The journal is in Switzerland in an account to my name.
Once we get there, I'll pay you what's left, then you can go home.
You're firing me?
This isn't about the gold anymore.
It's between me and Matthew.
Well, it's your money.
What?
Fuck.
Oh, god.
Shit.
Stay down.
Fuck!
Are you okay?
Oh, my god.
These cabbies always have guns.
Okay, I found it.
Yes.
Holy shit, you got them.
Just because I don't like guns doesn't mean I'm bad shot.
I hit him.
I can't hold them off anymore.
Then don't hold them off.
We need to face them head on.
Help me!
Oh, god.
Come on.
Well, there's good news and bad news.
Uh, bad news is our mode of transportation is completely fucked.
Good news is...
The booze survived.
What?
It means, "this is bullshit."
It's what my dad used to say, and Matthew and i would laugh, which would only make him angrier.
I didn't wanna get back into this.
The black swan, the Spanish got that.
All I got was four years of good behavior.
I'm not going back to fucking prison.
Then why are you here?
The same reason as you, i guess.
History.
With everything that we solved and that we know, that there's still something left to be discovered.
The idea that a single gold coin could be mined by the inca, stolen by the Spanish, and touched by sir Francis Drake.
How would you say
"i wish I could take you back to your office tomorrow?"
And what about...
"I'll take you to a back room?"
"I'd take off all your clothes."
"I'd slide my fingers up your legs."
"I'd fuck you on the table."
For the record, i...
I think you'd be a great ceo.
Yeah?
Guess we'll never know.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Salaam alaikum.
We can lay low at Charlotte's house.
She can arrange for the flight to Switzerland.
You sure we can trust her?
Charlotte's the type of archeologist who can't stand that the gold isn't in the wing of the Smithsonian as we speak.
I'm glad you survived.
I need a cigarette.
You smoke?
It's a shame you've made up your mind.
When you got me started on Drake's gold,
I did some more research.
I know where your brother's keeping it.
If he even decided to use that, it could be anywhere.
My dear child, have you learned nothing?
History repeats itself.
Not only does an offshore recovery guarantee he won't be taxed on his findings, but a true historian like your brother would be only too happy to fulfill its destiny.
Drake was trying to get to the canary islands when he died.
Well, for Matthew, that's par for the course.
I need a ticket to Switzerland.
I'm gonna show up at the bank and put the journal into custody.
It's done.
Look, when you showed up, i was in a bad place.
But you convinced me that we could make history.
The biggest find of this generation, remember?
More gold than king tut's tomb?
Jack, you came because i was paying you.
Yeah, maybe.
But it's bigger than that now.
Mave, what have you got to lose?
Why not bring down your brother and reclaim what you rightfully found?
The biggest salvage haul in the history of modern times destroyed like the buddhas of bamiyan.
The history of the world destroyed by a selfish, greedy bastard.
So we follow the gold to the canary islands.
You know, there's still time for me to take you to Switzerland.
No, my brother is going down.
You see that rock over there?
The castle is right behind it.
You've been here before?
I'm working with Matthew.
I trusted you!
I'll come back for you.
- Jack!
Even if they survived the fall and the gunshots, they won't survive the sharks, not with all that blood.
Do I look like I run a hospital wing here?
Just because i am the closest thing to a hospital on this island?
Are you going to tell me what happened now?
It's from a knife.
It's a lead bullet.
Thanks for joining me.
You're insane.
Didn't you choose to come here?
Didn't you choose to hire a mercenary, track down our gold?
My gold?
Drake's gold?
That's why we're here, aren't we?
Because you're too dense to understand that running an international salvage company means keeping our findings from our competition.
Our father used this place for years as a warehouse for black market gold.
You think we were just given this life?
Do not say that about dad.
He was the best scientist, archeologist that either of us ever knew.
Dad was a criminal.
Dad had his faults, but he was not a murderer.
What do you think would happen if we reported this to the Western Sahara?
Or this to Spain or France?
Claiming rights and lawsuits for the rest of our lives!
I am not a goddamn law firm, mave.
I'm an archeologist.
You are not an archeologist.
You're a psychopath.
And I'll be damned if I let you take down Adams and run it into the ground.
Says the girl who was about to release our father's journal.
It's a good thing I'm stopping that.
You actually think you're the one in control?
I brought you here to get that code and destroy dad's journal.
Take her inside.
Wake up.
You mentioned a castle last night.
Drake.
There are three castles.
Castillo de San Juan bautista, castillo de San cristóbal, castillo de San andrés.
It's different.
Do you mean castillo de la muerte?
Not even tourists.
Well, that's because it's rigged to explode.
That's a legend.
This is not going to work.
Give me the code, mave, and I'll make sure the greatest salvage company in the world lives to fight another day.
That's what our father wanted.
Dad brought us to places like this as kids.
We played pirates.
Remember when I found that blue piece of glass and you told me it was a treasure?
That was a good day.
You need help, Matthew.
When did it stop becoming about the work?
About finding ancient civilizations?
About uncovering secrets that no one else in the world could know?
Like you did noor and Henry and Jack?
And that hooker in Dubai who was so coked out of her mind she didn't know she was fucking a psycho?
You stupid bitch.
I've been the one who knows where the bodies are buried.
I'm your sister.
I'm ceo.
Drake is my destiny, and if that surprises you, then you never truly knew me.
Now, give me the code, dear sister.
Shoot and we're all dead.
Not a step closer.
You know the history of this place, don't you, Matthew?
Drake rigged it to blow up.
He filled the walls with gunpowder.
It was the only thing that he could do to protect his gold against the Spanish.
I don't believe you.
The powder still burns.
This is bullshit.
Okay, Jack.
From the incas to the Spanish to Drake to me here, archeologists have been waiting 400 years to be in your position.
You're not gonna blow it all up.
You're not gonna kill mave.
You know, you're right, Matthew.
There's no difference between a privateer and a pirate.
They both take what's not theirs.
Quick, let's go.
Leave me.
Take the money and go.
Don't you get it, mave?
It's not about the money.
It was never about the money with you.
Come on.
We're almost there.
I saw this on the way.
It's not vintage, but it'll do.
I'll get it started.
That's enough, Jack.
You give up, I'll let mave live.
Okay.
It's funny, isn't it?
I mean, you're dying at the hands of an antique.
I found your gun.
Bye, Jack.
Crap.
Drake.
So many stories about Drake.
And they're beautiful, really.
The best one is how he died.
Alone, sick, his body eating itself from the inside out.
This great explorer of the earth, conqueror of empires, left his final mission...
Unfinished.
It is my great pleasure to return this incan gold to its rightful home in Peru.
This gold has taken a long journey from the mines of the inca, to the hands of the conquistadors, to the holds of Drake's ships, and finally to castillo de muerte.
This gold became an unrelenting obsession from my father, my brother, and me.
It is with great relief that we return it to you, the true owners, to free Adams and myself for future adventures.
Thank you.
There will come time when I'll cease to find your lateness charming.
I had to see someone who has a lead on this.
That's chen dynasty.
I thought you were out of the game.
Don't you miss it?
I have responsibilities now.
Besides, you said you like to work alone.
Yeah, for this I might need an accomplice.
This isn't made with Jade.
Carbon dating checks out.
Seems impossible, but it's real.
Holy fucking shit.
How do you say that in French?
