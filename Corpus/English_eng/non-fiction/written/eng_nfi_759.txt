Run, run, run!

Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...
- We got her!

Mommy!
This is the new one.
I'm Commander Waterford.
May God make me truly worthy.
He is my husband.
Don't get any ideas.
Fertility is a gift directly from God.
You girls will serve the Leaders of the Faithful and their barren wives.
You will bear children for them.
Welcome to the friggin' loony bin.
Blessed are the meek, dear.
What'd they do to her?
"If my right eye offends thee, pluck it out."
He's the Commander's driver.
Maybe he watches me.
There's an Eye in your house.
Be careful.
My name is June.
I intend to survive.
Blue.
I let it take me.
Blue Moon.
Rhapsody in Blue.
Tangled Up in Blue.
Blue Oyster Cult.
Blue Monday.
Our car was that color.
We bought it off Craigslist.
It smelled like maple syrup.
Luke said it was a leak in the radiator, it was probably bad for kids.
After we got it fixed, I missed that smell.
And so did Hannah.
She said it smelled like Saturdays.
I wish he'd hurry the fuck up.
Hi.
Blessed be the fruit.
May the Lord open.
We should go.

Would you like to take the long way?
You're going to get caught in the rain.
I like the rain.
Okay, whatever.
We're going home.
- Under His eye.

Do you think it's safe to talk here?
If we're careful.
Are you from here?
Brookline.

Missoula, Montana, if you can believe that.
I moved here for school.
Do you work in the city?

I was an assistant book editor.
After my daughter Hannah was born, it was part-time but sometimes it was just paperwork.
But we did novels and academic titles.
Once we did nine volumes on the history of falconry.
Oh, man.
Actually, that sounds like it'd be fun to me right now.
Yeah, it kind of sounds amazing.
I worked at the university.
Lecturer in cellular biology.
Wow.
I thought all the college professors were sent to The Colonies or...
I have two good ovaries.
So they were kind enough to overlook my sinful past.
Lucky me.
St. Paul's.
That was my dad's parish.
My daughter was baptized there.
They took down St. Patrick's in New York City.
Blew it up and dumped every stone in the Hudson River.
They fucking erased it.
And how do you know that?
How do you know there's an Eye in my house?
It's okay.
To be relieved it wasn't you.
It was someone.
I know.
There's a way to help them.
You can join us.
What do you mean "us"?
There's a network.
I don't know.

No one is until they have to be.
Waterford is important.

You should find out and tell us.
Find out what?

Don't say a word.

There is an "us"?
It seems imagined, like secrets in the fifth grade.
People with mysterious histories and dark linkages.
It doesn't seem as if it should be the true shape of the world.
That's a hangover from an extinct reality.
Now, the Guardians of the Faithful and American soldiers still fight with tanks in the remains of Chicago.
Now, Anchorage is the capital of what's left of the United States, and the flag that flies over that city has only two stars.
Now, darkness and secrets are everywhere.
Now, there has to be an "us."
Because, now, there is a "them."
Get caught in the rain?
Yes.
You were gone a while.
Sometimes we walk home along by the river.
You need to be careful.
By the river?
With her.

She's my partner.

Don't get too close to her.

He wants to see you.
Who?
The Commander.
Tonight, in his office.
Why?
9:00.

It's forbidden for us to be alone with the Commanders.
We aren't concubines.

Maybe he knows about Ofglen.
Have I been invited to my own ending?
No.
'Cause it isn't an invitation.
I can't send my regrets.
Offred!
It's the birthmobile.
Hurry.

I've got it.
Thank you.
I'll pray for good news.
Everything will be fine.
It will.

It's wonderful, isn't it?

Who is it?
Ofwarren.

One-eyed bat-shit-crazy Janine.
What will she give birth to?
An Unbaby, with a pinhead or a snout like a dog's or no heart?
The chances for a healthy birth are one in five, if you can get pregnant at all.
You all right?
Fuck!

We're almost there.
Okay, here we are.
It's all right.
Hi.

There's real coffee, can you smell it?
We do the work and then they pig out.
It's okay.
Breathe, breathe.
There you go.
Breathe.
You're doing so great.
Really wonderful.

It hurts.
- Such a special day.

Breathe.
Breathe.
We are right here with you.
Breathe.
Breathe.
Breathe.
She's been doing so well.

Let's close our eyes.
Mmm, this coffee.

Yes.

Breathe.
Breathe.
Hold.

And again, girls.
There's a smell coming from that room.
Something primal.
It's the smell of dens.
Hold.

Of inhabited caves.
It's the smell of the plaid blanket on the bed.
Where the cat gave birth, once, before she was spayed.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
It's the smell of genesis.
Hold.

Exhale, exhale, exhale.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
And hold, hold, hold.
Exhale, exhale, exhale.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Hey.
And hold, hold, hold.
You're doing great.
Exhale, exhale, exhale.
Mmm.
You smell so good.
You do.
Hi, Hannah.
Hi.
Hello there.

Is Daddy keeping you awake?
Hey, Mom.
Hi.

Very good, I think.
Hey, will the doctor call me when the tests come back?
Oh, the lab just sent them up.
All normal.
Genetic screening and cardiac tests are perfect.
She is a healthy little girl.
Oh, yes, she is.

Praised be.
- Yes, she is.

Don't lose that.
Don't lose that.
Ooh, hello.
Someone's gonna take their first bath.
Yes.
Oh, here we are.
Here we are, Hannah.
Bath time.

Where are the babies?
Oh, we had a difficult night.
Two went to the intensive care unit.
And the others are with God.
Oh, it hurts!
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Should I wash these?
No, the mistress is particular.
Just set them on the counter.

All right.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
It's so crowded up there.
At least someone spiked the juice.
You okay?
He wants to see me, alone.
Your commander?
Shit.
You don't know why?
No.
Maybe he did this with the one before you.
Maybe she told someone about it.
Let me see what I can find out.
It's too dangerous.
It'll be okay.
I'm sneaky.
What are you doing?
I'm just helping, Mrs. Waterford.
Well, leave it.
Come with me.
Offred, what's going on up there?
Her contractions are getting much closer together.
It's taking forever.
Is it breech, dear?
Did you hear that word?
No, ma'am.
Oh, well, we'll have to be patient then, won't we?
Yes, ma'am.
Would you like a cookie, dear?
You shouldn't spoil them.
Sugar is bad for them.
Oh, surely one won't hurt.
It is a special day.
Offred, would you like a cookie?
Yes, please.
Thank you.
Here you are.
Oh, isn't she well behaved?
You can go.
Little whores, all of them.
But still, you can't be choosy.
You have to take what they hand out.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Girls!
Energy!
Let Him feel your devotion...
And we will be rewarded.
Hold, hold, hold.
Exhale, exhale, exhale.
Good girl, Ofwarren.
Good girl.
You are doing so well.
We are so proud of you.
No, I'm, uh, I'm fine.

Stretch your legs a bit.
Girls, come on, now.

Help her now.
Get her to the chair.
Tell her it's time.
It's time.
It's time to push.
Push, push, push!
Breathe, breathe, breathe!
Push, push, push!
Breathe, breathe, breathe!
Breathe, breathe, breathe!
Breathe, breathe, breathe!
Push, push, push!
Breathe, breathe, breathe!
Push, push, push!
Breathe, breathe, breathe!
Push, push, push!
Breathe, breathe, breathe!
Please bless us.

A fine and healthy girl.
God be praised.
Clumsy!
This is a time for rejoicing, my love.
This is our happy, happy moment.
Think of what's to come for you, my girl.
All right.

Look at me.

She's beautiful.

Precious.

She's just perfect.
Isn't she?
Do you have a name?
Angela.
Angela.
Angela, Angela, Angela, Angela, Angela, Angela,
Angela, Angela, Angela, Angela, Angela, Angela.
Angela, Angela, Angela.
Luke?
Hey.

Are you hungry?

Where is she?
Did they take her for a blood test?
Huh?

I don't know.

Code Yellow.

What's that?
I don't know.

- Luke?

No, wait there.

I don't see her.
Luke?
What?
Stay here.
Oh, my God.
Hey.

Excuse me?
What are you doing?
She's alive.
My baby.
I told them.
She's not your baby.
Of course she is.
Isn't she beautiful?
Luke?
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait!

She's here!

Don't take my baby!

No!

Stop!
It's my baby!

She's mine.

Just give her to me, Luke.
No!
Okay, she's fine.

Give her to me.
Don't take my baby!
Here you are.

Yeah, she's okay.

She's okay.
Don't take my baby!

Don't take my baby!
Please!
No one knew anything about what your Commander might want.
Sorry.
But that doesn't mean it's bad.
If he accuses you of something, don't defend yourself.

Just apologize.
They love to be forgiving.
Okay.
Thank you for trying.

He probably just wants a blowjob.
What did he say?
When he asked to see you alone?
He didn't.

Be careful.
A lot of the drivers work for the Eyes.
He said I shouldn't trust you.
He said you were dangerous.
Really?

I mean he's right.

Especially a carpet-munching gender traitor.
Time to get up now.
This little girl needs a nip.
I have work to get to.

Yeah, I nursed my son.
I've done it before.
Come on.
Come on.

Come on.
Shh.
Caleb used to do that when he ate.
Pull my hair like that.
Caleb's your brother.
I'm your mommy.

Beyond the Commander's door is a place where women do not go.
Not even Serena Joy.
What male totems are kept in there?
I guess there may be something he wants from me.
To want is to have a weakness.
That gives me hope.
But I can't stop thinking about the girl in the horror movie who goes down into the basement when the light is out.
The girl who thinks her boyfriend with the perfect hair is just playing a sexy prank.
"Justin, are you down there?"
And then she descends, with a stupid smile, to her bloody end.
That girl is a fucking moron.
Come in.
Please, God, don't let me be a fucking moron.
Close the door behind you.
Sit down.
Please.
Thank you for coming.
You're welcome.
You can look at me.
We're not supposed to.
In here, we might be able to bend the rules.
Just a bit.
Hello there.
Hi.
I imagine you must find this strange.
I guess it's a little strange.
I want...

I'd like to play a game with you.
A game?

Do you know how to play?
Yes.
Good.
Three-eighty-six to three-eighty-three.
You're good, but I caught you at the end there.
I'm rusty.
Then we'll have to have a rematch.
All right.
I'm out of town next week, but when I get back?
I'll check my schedule.
Well.
See if you can squeeze me in.
Where are you going?
Nothing exciting, just meetings.
Well, after you get back, then.
It's a date.
Now, I think it's time for you to go home.
Thank you for the game.
You're very welcome.
Good night.
Good night.

Does he know what the Commander and I did last night?
Our illicit journey into the world of triple word scores?
Does he care?
I think he does.
Ofglen.
I can tell her that the Commander is going to Washington.
Will she be surprised by the Scrabble game?
She'll be glad I let him win.

She'll be proud of me for that.
♪ Will you recognize me?

Blessed be the fruit.
May the Lord open.
You must be Offred.
Yes.
Praised be.
We've been sent good weather.
Yes.
Which I receive with joy.
Has Ofglen been transferred to a new post so soon?
I am Ofglen.
Fuck.
