So you can reproach me again?
It's not always about you and me.
I have something to celebrate.
So that's why you look so angry.
And once again you didn't make any mistakes.
Didn't I?
Psychiatrists aren't supposed to make mistakes.
You can't exclude mistakes.
You don't believe it was Charlie, right?
Well, neither do I.
Did you iron it yourself?
So it's back to business as usual.
Sitting at home won't solve anything.
And Charlie?
You promised to get him out.
You know who really did it, don't you?
I'm not sure anymore.
When are we going home?
I think we should head back.
Let's stay a little bit longer.
We need to move on.
Yes.
You should try.
What's this?
"Thank you for your hard work and commitment." Maasland Police Force.
They'll miss us.
You are going to help me type it up, aren't you?
I'll fetch a vase.
Help!
Help!
Hello?
I have information about Kato and Sofia.
Some pervert who calls himself White.
I don't think it's a coincidence.
Vinken was so convinced that Vanderkerk had murdered Kato.
And we still don't know precisely where Vanderkerk was that night in Elen
Do you still have Vanderkerk's Belgian phone data?
Kato, grandma and Marcus think we should go home.
Would you mind if we got rid of your things?
She doesn't mind.
And I do too.
It's good for me, seeing you.
It reminds me of the old days.
Luc, I don't like coming here behind Marcus' back.
I like him a lot.
I don't want to lose our girl.
I'll call you.
Bye, darling.
RESIGNATION Dear colleagues,
You know I have struggled for years with an alcohol problem.
Now I have got an ex-pupil pregnant, Ines Anthoni.
So I feel I must offer my resignation as headmaster of the school.
CHIP SHOP 'T SMULLERKE
Marion Schneider, federal police Tongeren.
Do you know this man?
He was released from a psychiatric clinic
What's the matter?
Sweetie?
It feels like so long ago.
Vanderkerk gave me money to raid his competitors' labs.
We always met here in 't Smullerke.
During the shooters festival Kato staggered up here, outside.
They chatted a bit and then suddenly she was on the back of his bike.
I only ever did it to help Melanie with Beau Sejour.
I'd already earned enough to finish the hotel, so...
And Leon was a such a good rider.
How do you think?
Aggressively.
So you just let your nephew's girlfriend leave with an aggressive drug dealer?
Did you manipulate the footage from the petrol station?
I was worried I would be exposed.
Charlie must have found the USB drive and handed it in, to get back at me.
We both know it wasn't Charlie.
But how on earth does he know so much about the crime?
You have until the station.
Cyril?
Where did you get all that money?
For your baby.
I want to take care of you.
Come inside.
A ghost?
How could Jef Dewael know Kato was murdered at Beau Sejour?
Of course, because only a few people can see her.
Why doesn't your ghost just tell us who did it, Vinken?
They've found the remains of Claudia De Wit.
Didn't you think that Kato's and Claudia De Wit's cases were linked?
If we go now we'll be there in half an hour.
You also feel it doesn't add up, don't you?
I won't ask you again.
That's a tough one.
Do you know who made that sex tape of Leon and Sofia?
I did.
I uploaded it because I wanted to show Alexander that Leon is no saint either.
I think that's the worst thing I've ever done.
That's why I want to go and apologize.
I...
But listen, I have nothing to with their deaths.
You know...
I sometimes feel... so lonely.
Understand?
Better late than never, I suppose?
First I thought it was the weather.
But then I saw one of the mares grinding her hind legs in the soil.
At one point there were ten of them.
The strange thing is, my husband first dug up a sealed wooden coffin.
But it was empty.
It was so bizarre, I called the police.
And they found Claudia deeper underground.
If you don't mind, I'll take a look.
PHOTOS OF THE IDENTIFICATION OF VICTIM CLAUDIA DE WIT
Claudia De Wit died five years ago.
They dug up her remains together with an empty coffin.
Look.
Subaru.
Look.
Ren√©e?
We've come to return something.
Sorry that I took it.
Why are you giving this to me?
It's not mine.
You know who this belongs to now?
It's yours.
I know I can't demand anything.
But please, check the Subaru.
Vinken...
You know it wasn't Charlie.
I'm contacting the examining magistrate to confirm your arrest.
If you want to call your wife you can do it now.
Right, shall we check that Subaru then?
Kristel and I were just about to toast the new bird houses.
We can talk like grown-ups, can't we?
If he says no...
Alright, then I'll drink it.
I think we should talk about honesty.
Luc sent an email to the school.
It's not from me.
So it's all lies about a headmaster who can't keep his hands off young girls?
And knocks one of them up, now and then?
Is it true?
Of course I can.
I would never lie about that.
Was she with us in the west area?
Answer me!
Then...
I swear I can see her, Kristel.
Get a move on.
Don't take it personally, Luc.
Bingo.
You know this doesn't mean a thing yet, right?
Fuck.
I don't know.
How did you get out of the coffin?
The Subaru is registered to Veerle Boesmans
So someone forgot to cancel her licence plate.
Marcus?
And images of his van driving to school on the night of Sofia and Leon's murder.
Your dead wife's car.
I don't get it.
The caravan where Sofia and Leon disappeared is near Otten's house.
Maybe they encountered each other there.
My mother mentioned the significance of certain circumstances.
A date or a location can be a trigger.
Where did Veerle and Boris meet?
At the shooters festival.
Claudia De Wit was murdered exactly one year after the shooters festival.
Kato Hoeven was murdered exactly six years after the shooters festival.
Sofia and Leon are Veerle and Boris for him.
My desk stinks...
God damn!
Why else would Cyril want to stay over there?
I'll be right back.
The fucking bastard.
Kato.
Is that what you said to Sofia, too?
My little girl, she came to fetch her things and run away with Leon Vinken.
No one leaves me for a Vinken.
If sand doesn't work, maybe cement will.
I'll kill you!
Bastard!
Luc, let him go.
Daddy?
Well now, Luc.
Sometimes you have to improvise, mate.
What do you think?
Then I have the right to defend myself, don't I?
Marcus Otten, you're under arrest for the murders of Claudia De Wit
Kato Hoeven, Sofia Otten and Leon Vinken.
Kristel, would you ever leave me for such a pathetic figure?
Kept it on his dead wife's name.
God damn.
Dad?
Filthy slut.
Is there blood on this?
You'll come to your senses.
Are you alright?
Come on, I'll take you home.
Listen, I don't have to be friendly, you know.
Six years ago.
After the shooters festival.
Why are you showing me this?
Because you're exactly the same.
Was it here you were screwing Vinken?
I really don't get it.
You, Claudia De Wit, Leon...
Kato...
I was being a dick.
I just felt like...
I just felt as if no one needed me anymore.
You're the only one who can still see me.
But, didn't my dad say...
Last week?
