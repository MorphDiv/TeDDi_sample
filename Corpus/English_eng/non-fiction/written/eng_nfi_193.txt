Previously on KEVIN CAN WAIT...
Sergeant Mendez called me in.
He wants me to go back undercover.
Remember those guys selling that counterfeit art?
Well, one of them's been askin' about me, so they need me to make an appearance.
I'm up for that promotion at work.
So it's... it's more money, it's my own parking space.
Here's the offer...
Six figs, stock options, piece of everything we develop, plus... a signing bonus.
$10,000?

All we gotta do is find the location of where the deal's going down and we're good.
- Let Cellucci take the lead.

You didn't tell me Cellucci's on this case.
We gotta see Domingo again.
No, we can't.

This weekend is our biggest art show in Boston.
So it's settled.

She kicked the table.

Why would you do that?
- Hi!

Hi, honey.
I'm here to take your husband away to a hotel for the weekend.
Oh.

Come on in.
Oy.

- No, of course not.

Just pretending to be his wife gives me agita.
How you do it for real?

Well, you know, it's not easy, but he does have some redeeming qualities.
- Mm.

I packed Breathe-Rite strips for him, so make sure he puts one on before going to bed, okay?
- Ugh.

So it's more like he dies and comes back to life every 30 seconds.
- It's fun.

Um, also, if you want him to stay asleep, put on something soothing, but not rainforest noises because, uh, the monkey sounds, they really freak him out.
- Oh.

Okay.

What?

This is what my character's wearing.
Well, you look like a guy who's about to get whacked on "The Sopranos."
Yeah.

He looks like Missy Elliot.
Yes!

Yes!
- Go change.

Oh, boy.
We got a problem.
All right, before you start complaining,
I will be the bigger person.
I will take the pull-out.

Cool.
Not even gonna fight me?
I thought I was gonna have to, but you made it pretty easy.
Idiot.
What are you gonna do?

Okay.

I was waiting for the shoe to drop.
It was 10 years ago.

No. 'Cause I don't live in the past.
- I live in the present.

And I'm presently about to get into this minibar!
Okay, hey.

You heard Domingo in the lobby.

""Enjoy yourselves""
That's what I plan on doing.
- Put it back.

Put it... back.
- Do not open it.

Do not.

- Don't do it.

- Don't open it.

♪♪
Thank you.
Okay, there he is.

It's promotion time.
- Donna!

I wanted to talk to you about the opening for the head nurse position.
I would love to.

And by the way, you look great today.
That's a little doughnut there, but lookin'...

Thing is, we went with Joanne.
Ah.

I said we went with Joanne.
Jo...
Joanne?
Mm-hmm.
She's got a great energy.
And she'd be a perfect fit for the high school.
Perfect!
Great.
I'm not gonna cry, I'm not gonna cry,
I'm not gonna cry.
Should we key his car?
No.
Yumi, no...
Maybe.
Stand by.
Hey.

Couldn't be better.
Uh, I believe the ping-pong table just opened up.
Wanna give it a go?
No, I have some things to do at home.
Get out.
What?
Oh.

So much growth, it's stupid.
Sinking ship.
We burned through all the cash.

Anyway, I'm gonna grab me a scone and hit the road.
Seriously.

Ohhh... ♪♪
Sleep tight, you big, dumb dope.
Domingo, I have to tell you, our buyers would love this.
Our clients really respond to sharp metal... th... things.
- It's all the rage in Europe.

So is that where you ship from?

Where's your husband?
Oh, he's... he's sleeping off a rough night.
He got into it a little too deep with the minibar.
He has a problem with alcohol?
No.

Housekeeping!
Housekeeping?
At the beach?
Housekeeping!
What?
""Soothing Sounds of the Ocean""
Nice try, Cellucci.
But you gotta be a little smarter than that to fool...
Crap!

So everything is manufactured in Prague?
Yes.
Then we drop ship to various locations here in the States.
In fact, we have a warehouse right in the back.
What?

- Yeah.

- Can I borrow you for a second?

- I'll be right back.

See, I think it reflects man's inhumanity towards man in a cruel world.
Plus, it looks like the classroom got hit by a twister.
You know what I'm talkin' about... toothache lady?
Got a lampshade dress.

Can I talk to you?
Okay.
What the hell are you doing?
You thought your little ocean sounds would keep me sleeping?
Well, it didn't work.
Well, it's 1:14, so it kind of did work.
Just go back upstairs.

No.

It's not gonna happen.

- No, you won't.

- Just stop.

- What?

- I have no idea what the...

Stop it!
Okay, okay...
- Stop right...

Big baby, you're back in it.
Here's where we're at.
Domingo told me there is a warehouse in this building.
So now all we have to do is get him to admit that he's selling forgeries.
- And at that point...

- Domingo!

Yeah, somebody smells like cherry tobacco.
Ah.
Hey, Domingo and I, we were talking
- about his operation.

The secret to my success?

It's all junk.
- You're selling forgeries?

For instance, this is called the "Eye of Zeus. "
It's actually my nephew Stevie.
I took it on an iPhone.
You zoom out, we're at Chuck E. Cheese.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I think some money just walked into the room.
- Enjoy it.

So if they're not forgeries...
- Yes.

- illegal.

I can't believe this.

This was gonna be a big thing for my career and now...
I'm just gonna...

That's a tough break.
Hey, listen, there's a 7 p.m. flight.
I'm gonna make it to Mets Fantasy Camp.
- So if you don't mind...

And on your way out, make sure you grab another $9 candy bar.
Like you haven't had enough junk today.
Wait a second.
What?
- That's it.

That's how they're making their money.
They don't make it on the hotel room.
They make it on the minibar, the junk.
That's what they're doing here!
That's it.

Follow me.

- Well, other way.

- No.

It's still wrong.

Think about it.

Why spend all that money?

'Cause it's not just art they're shipping.
So narcotics.
Exactly.

That's cocaine!
It's plaster.
It got in deep.
You done?
- Yes, I'm done.

So much for your minibar theory, huh?
I'm not done.
I'm done.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You know what?

What did I tell you?

What did I say?

We cracked the case!
This is unbelievable.

- or bump fists or...

Yes.

My phone.
Oh, it's Donna.

Hey, did you get my messages?
I've been trying to reach you since yesterday.
Yeah, listen.

Honey, you're not gonna believe this, but that little weasel Anderson...
He picked Joanne over me.
He said she had a great energy.
Well, you know what?

That's right.

Babe, I'm sorry.

But I-I-I gotta cut you off.
I'm...

What?

Oh, no, no, I'm fine.

I mean, my juices are flowing.
It's like I'm seeing things before they even happen.
It's almost like...

Oh... wait, honey, are you...
Are you thinking about going back on the job?
It's happening!
It is?
You treat all your buyers this way?
You're not a buyer, you're a cop.
- My apartment was bugged.

We looked.

Which, by the way, my husband broke.
That was not me.
It wasn't in the giraffe.
It was in the gold toad next to it.
Everyone always checks the giraffe.
Sorry.
Hello?
Maritza, we'll get the drugs.
We'll load 'em up in the van and we're out of here.
Yeah.
You have the right to remain silent.
We can do this the easy way or the hard way.
Okay, that's the wrong angle.
♪♪
It's throbbing, but I gotta say, my back feels great.
Why is it that every time I'm around you, my life goes into the toilet?
You wanna write me up again?
Well, you know what?

I'm retired.

Okay, all right, could you just figure out
- how to get us out of this?

I'll just do a sit-up and unhook myself.
I saw it in a movie once.
Yeah.

Hold on.
- Hello.

You know, Yumi, I slept on it, and I thought I could keep it classy, you know, and not say anything.
But then I look at his fat, little monkey face and I just...

I can't do it.
Um, Vice Principal Anderson, can I talk to you for a moment, please?
So, for too long, you have taken advantage of my hard work and my dedication to this school.
And it's just...

Donna, maybe we should just go into my office and talk about this because this is...
- Oh, this is what?

Oh!

You know what?

Because I've been at this school for 15 years, okay?
And Joanne over there, who got my promotion,
- by the way, has been here for six.

No, you take my name out of your mouth, Larry.
Because you're the problem here.
Who else agrees that he should be fired?
Huh?

Raise 'em high.

No one.
Okay.

I'm fine.
I'm fine.
My husband's going back on the police force.
And my son-in-law has got a great job.
And I don't need this.
- I quit.

No, save it, Larry.

Would you hurry up?
I'm moving as fast as I can, all right?
I still don't have blood in 60% of my body.
All right, you wanna know why I wrote you up?
Yeah, we're about to be killed by a drug lord, but let's get closure on something that happened back in 2007.
It's because of what happened on News 12.
What are you talkin' about?
You remember the fire at the mattress factory?
You and me were doing crowd control, and the news wanted to talk to us and you said...
"Well, if you really wanna know about traffic around a mattress, talk to this one. "
That was classic.
Well, it was the last thing my father ever saw before he died.
Really?
But I...
I had no idea.

Well, he's not dead.

But...
The point is that people made fun of me because of you.
Look, we were just treating you like one of the guys 'cause that's what you wanted.
No, I know.

Just not on TV.
For two years, they called me Bed, Bath, Cellucci.
That's... that's...
That's not cool.

Okay.
What do we do now?
Look, I think we just keep talking and slowly rebuild trust again, you know?
I'm talking about the situation, idiot!
Okay, I'm gonna get back on those crates, all right?
When Domingo comes in, you lure him right into this area right here.
I am gonna swing down and take him out.
Now listen to me.
It's imperative that he's right here, okay?
'Cause this is the apex of the golf swing, okay?
It's right here is where I clock him.
So that's your plan?

Think about it.

- Who would ever do that twice?

You know what?
You're not gonna fix yourself by breaking someone else.
Okay, here she comes.
- All right.

Playtime's over.

Actually, I've had enough of you.
FBI.
- FBI?

- Maritza?

Oh, yeah.

Come on, it's pretty obvious.

- Shut up!

Fred and Wilma are safe.
Move it!

I got it from here, guys.
Did that skank just call us Fred and Wilma?
I think she did.
Oh.
Kendra, I-I thought I heard you leave.
Oh, no.

But what are you doing here?

Of course.
I do work.
I'm going now.
Aren't you gonna change?
Oh.

I change for work.
Okay, well, go get dressed and I'll drive you.
Babe, look at us.
You know, you've got a great job, and I'm going to Columbia.
It's all happening.
I know, I know.

Whoo-hoo-hoo.
Okay.
It's only eight hours until she picks me up.
♪♪
Hey, I gotta say, really, really nice job out there.
You know, this was a good bust for you.
Just for the record, I'm sorry about the whole mattress-on-the-news thing.
Thanks.
It was a good bust for both of us.
And since we're apologizing,
I am sorry for writing you up.
I appreciate you saying that...
Officer Memory Foam.
Yeah, and by the way, you had food on your shirt the whole time.
Yeah, that was...

- You were like...

"Whoa, oh!

Whoa.

Okay.
You know what you should do?

Yeah, I...
I might do that.

- Hey!

Hey!
- Aw!

- They're saying you're a hero!

First of all, the term "hero" is thrown around too often.
But in this case, they threw a tight spiral 'cause it's so true!
- It's so true!

I was crushing it out there!
- I mean, I was unstoppable.

Ah.

But that doesn't mean he's not gonna have plenty of time
- for you guys to...

What?
Who said that?
You did.

- Yeah.

When we talked on the phone.
I said, "Danger is happening" I was happening.
- Oh...

I-I love being retired.

Oh.
- Oh.

I kind of... quit my job.
What... what do you mean?
I told you.

Are you saying that neither one of us have a job right now?
Honey, honestly, what are we gonna do?
We are the Gables, all right?
We've survived much worse than this.
Let's not forget Chale has an amazing job now.
That's a good point.

Uh...

You... you're a good man.
Uh...
Thank you, Mr. Gable.
No, no, e...
Enough of that.

Funny story, Kevin, u-ugm.
