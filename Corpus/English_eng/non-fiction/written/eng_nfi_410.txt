You killed my father!
I merely orderedhimkilled.
Dead men tell no tales.
[groans]
Emma Swan, will you marry me?
Yes!
This is your chance at love and happiness.
That's him?
Go get him.
[indistinct conversations] [groans, screams]
Aah!
Ahh.
Hope that didn't sting.
[birds chirping]
[sword unsheathes] [horse whinnies] [carriage clattering] [hooves clopping] [horse whinnies]
Where is she?
Where's Snow White?
The cabin, Your Majesty.
She was seen entering before dawn.
There's been no movement inside since.
Gather the neighboring villagers.
I want them to see justice served on their beloved Princess.
Regina, if you kill Snow White you'll only harden the people against you.
You have to prove to them that you can show mercy if you want them to love you like they do her.
I didn't come here to show mercy.
I came for a heart.
[door squeaking]

Regina.

She's gone.
[bones crack]
Now... someone is going to tell me where she went.
[fire crackling]
Are you really going to protect her?
She doesn't care about you.
I'mtheonewho cares.
Snow White doesn't love you.
Ido.
Don't listen to her.
She doesn't care about love.
I should know.
I was there when she threw her chance at love away.
Tinker Bell.
Hello, Regina.
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be living in a tulip somewhere?
What happened to me doesn't matter.
Just look at you.
You've done nothing but fill your heart with hate since we saw each other.
But it doesn't have to be that way.
What do you care about any of this?
I care because this started with me.
I showed you your future with the Pixie Dust.
The one with the lion tattoo...

He's still out there.
Pixie Dust doesn't dictate what I do.
Nothing and no one does.
Pixie Dust doesn't dictate anything.
It just shows you the possibilities.
It's up to you.
Thanks, but no, thanks.
I'm happy the way I am.
I don't believe you.
You're just saying that to hide the real reason that you won't take a chance on love.
You don't think you deserve it.
You really think you know me so well?
Hmm?
I'm going to spare this wretched person's life to prove she's wrong.
I do love you.
I love... all of you.
I hope you learn from this act of mercy, because next time, it will be your last.
[crickets chirping]
[Robin] Look, I don't mean to be rude, but why wouldn't Regina tell me that she had a double, just like I did?
[sighs] Because she wants to keep her dark side secret.
The truth is, if it were up to her, I'd no longer exist.
You mean to say you're the ne'er-do-well version of Regina, just as I am with the other Robin Hood?
Well, how about that?
Somebody in this godforsaken town
I actually have something in common with.
I beg your pardon?
I'm a queen, not some burlap-loving peasant who sleeps in dirt.
Excuse me...

Which is on dirt, but there is... separation.
No matter.

It doesn't change the fact that you and I are alike.
We both know that we don't belong here.
Perhaps.
So maybe I had the solution.
New York?
I think not.
I suppose you know where I should go, then?
Well, the one place you know you do belong...
Back to the realm I created with my wish.
I'll send you back.
And what do you get out of the bargain?
Well, you're a thief, aren't you?
I want you to steal something.
[owl hooting]
This is a graveyard.
Bodies aren't the only things buried here.
What are you after?
What exactly is this about?
Please stop asking questions... and dig.

Once Upon a Time S06E14 "Page 23"
Sync and corrected by Gianluca Belfiglio
Emma, it's beautiful.
I am so happy for you.
Me too, mom.
Thank you.

Well, if it makes you feel any better, I did.
So, how did Hook pop the question?
On board a romantic cruise on the Jolly Roger?
Well...
Did he make Smee and the rest of the crew serenade you?
We may never know, because I kind of said yes before he had a chance. [chuckles]
I cannot wait to tell your father that we have a wedding to plan.
Oh, about that...

Oh.

Well, Gideon's still out there, and even though I defeated him once, we don't really know what he's up to, and I don't feel like I can focus on anything else until I've really dealt with that.
Actually, you're going to have to.
[door closes] What now?
The Evil Queen.
What about her?
Is that an engagement ring?
Oh.

Um...

[gasps] Emma.
I'm happy for you.

Thanks.

That just leaves the question...

She's still a snake right?
[Regina] I have no idea.

And if she has figured out a way to escape her mortal coil... [sighs] well, there's no telling what Evil she could be up to.
[grunting, panting]
Couldn't you use magic to dig this hole?
You're right, but what would be the fun in that?
You don't mind a little dirty work, do you?
[clank]
And there it is... the sound of my victory.
A pair of scissors?
Don't underestimate them.

Capable of cutting a person from their fate.
You want to use them on Regina... to break her from her destiny.
No.
My plan for her involves something much more permanent.
I'm going to use these blades to finally separate us, so once and for all...
I can destroy her.
[snipping sound] [water sloshing] [buoy bell clanging]
You can tell the ocean your secrets, but the question is whether the ocean will tell you hers.
[chuckles]
Nemo.
I wanted to say goodbye.
I wouldn't be standing here without your help, but now that I am, I'm afraid it's time for your brother Liam and for the rest of my crew to set sail again on the Nautilus.
Well, that is a sad occasion, indeed.
[chuckles]
Not as sad knowing that you took my advice...
Set aside your revenge and found what was missing in your life...
A family.
Aye.
That, I did. [exhales deeply]
What is it?
Is something wrong?
My past has caught up with me, and this time, I've hurt the family of the woman I mean to marry.
[chuckles] Well, I suppose... [sniffs] I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, you know?
I was a villain, and villains don't get happy endings.
[chuckles] You still could.
Have you asked for forgiveness?
That's just it...
You're the only other person who knows.
Once they find out... there may be no coming back.
Be careful, my boy.
Guilt can be as corrosive to the soul as revenge.
Which means... that you must tell this woman and her family the truth orkeepit asecret and learn to forgive yourself.
What if I can't?
Either way, you must.
Heed my advice, Killian... please.
Seek forgiveness.
Because whatever happened, it will always stay with you.

Such a lovely and powerful pen.
So, you did figure out a way to de-snake yourself.
That's not yours.

I wouldn't want you ruining my plans by writing me out of existence with a swoop of your authorial pen.
That's what you think I want...

Well, isn't it?
After all, that's what Regina wants.
That's because she thinks you're the worst parts of her.
But you don't?
I know there's good in you, just like there's bad in her.
That means you can change.
And you thought you can break the rules by using your Author powers to give me a little push?
I don't know what I was going to do.
Well, I suppose I should be flattered.
Look at yourself.
You finally got the revenge you wanted on Snow White, and are you happy?
Perhaps not.
But I will be.
What are you planning?
Something you won't like.
That's why I'm here.
Eventually, you'll realize it's for the best.
Because you were right, Henry.
You're still my son.
What are you going to do?
Give this to Regina.
And, remember, no matter what anyone tries to tell you...
I love you.

Regina, we need to talk.
Daddy, please.
I've heard it all before.
I know... you don't think revenge will make me happy.
But I'm going to find out.
Don't try to stop me.
I'm not here to try to stop you.
Actually, I'm here to help you get it.
What?
Do you remember the first time that you cantered Rocinante?
Well, of course I do.
I watched you ride him across the field outside our manor.
No matter how far you went,
I could still see that smile on your face.
It wasn't a horse that put a smile on my face, daddy.
That was the day I met Daniel.
I know.
I want you to be happy again.
But I don't believe killing Snow White will do that.
Maybe by my helping you, you'll be able to move on so you can.
How can you help me?
With this.
This is one of your mother's spell books, that I've kept hidden from you.
It has a map inside that will lead us to a powerful object that can help find Snow White.
[exhales sharply]
Daddy.
[Mary Margaret] Wait.

[Regina] Page 23...
The page that magically appeared to me with what I thought could be an ending to my story with Robin...
A happy... ending.
Inside, it was just a cruel twist of fate, showing me an ending that could never be.
What does it mean?
It means the Evil Queen has found him... the other Robin, that is... and she wants me to know that she'll hurt him unless I face her.
"One last time."
Wait.

Without Gideon's sword, she can't hurt you without hurting herself.
Unless, of course, she figured out another way.
Regina, you can't go.

Well, we can't just leave Robin.
We won't.

I'm the one who convinced you to bring him here.
This is on me.
Emma, you don't have anything to make up for.
You were just trying to help.
[Henry] She's really gonna do this.
Maybe I was wrong to think she could change.
I'm sorry, kid.
Regina, what are you gonna do?
Go alone.
This is my battle to fight, and it has been ever since I tried to destroy my dark side up on that rooftop in New York.
You can't do this yourself.

I have to.
If I don't, this won't just end with Robin getting hurt.
She'll hurt everyone I care about...

And I can't let that happen.
The Evil Queen is going to get what she wants.
Our fight ends today.
♪♪
Can't say this is exactlywhatIhad inmind when I offered my services, unless I'm misreading the signals and things are about to take a much more exciting turn.
[chuckles] Keep dreaming.
Oh.

Uh, but I'm afraid you may have grossly... overestimated my importance to her.
I mean, Regina may have charged in to save Robin the hero's life, but me?
Much less likely.
[ropes creaking]
- Huh?

The only way you're going anywhere is if I allow it.
And that's not going to happen until I lure Regina here and destroy her.
Do you really think killing Regina is gonna solve your problems?
All it will do is make a martyr of her, and then nobody will be able to look at you without thinking of her.
Believe me, that part is no fun at all.
Oh, well, I suppose you have a better idea.
As a matter of fact, I do.
Release me.
Why the hell would I do that?
Because you were right...

And neither do you.
[scoffs]
Maybe Regina was right.
Maybe there is a reason that I'm here, but it's not to save her.
It's to save you.
[laughs]
I don't know what you've heard about me, but I don't need saving.
Don't you?
'Cause it looks to me as if you could really use a place to get a fresh start.
A fresh start?
Doing what?
My land is rather big.
I'm sure we could find something that'll pique your interest.
I'd think about it if I was you.
Because regardless of how things go down here today, you and I both know...

The only one who doesn't stand a chance is my... better half.
As much as I enjoy our walks, daddy, you can just give me the map and the spell book, and I can magic us there.
It'll be much quicker.
There's no need.
We're here.
[Regina scoffs] [whirring] [whooshing, light crackles]
What is this place?
Mother's spell book never would have led us here.
It's practically dripping with light magic.
You're right.
That's because I never learned about this place from a spell book.
Then what brought you here?
The fairy.
Tinker Bell.
So you lied to me.
This was never about getting my revenge.
No, Regina.
This is about getting something much better.
Follow me.
That's what we're here for...

Cupid's arrow.

You brought me here for a love spell?
It's not a love spell.
I know they don't work.
This arrow is a tool.
It will lead you to gaze upon the person you love most.
The fairy told me about the man with the lion tattoo.
You could use it to find him.
You betrayed me.
I always thought you were the one person on my side.
Regina, don't you see that I am?
Enough!
What are you doing?
Getting what I came for.
My revenge.

But then you found that ring, and I just couldn't bear to ruin that happiness.
How could you do this?
I've been asking myself the same question, and all I can say is that I was a broken man for a very long time, and I did horrendous things.
I'm not talking about that.

[exhales sharply]
You were about to burn your own memories.
Why would you do that?
Because I was ashamed, Emma, and scared of losing you and everything that matters to me.
And you really think that would happen after everything we've been through?
You tell me...

I'm not saying it would be easy.
You know them.

That's who they are.
This isn't just about them.
This is about me.
I already destroyed my own family once, and that was hard enough, but knowing that I destroyed yours, too, I just...
I didn't know how I could live with that.
You come to me, Hook, and you lean on me and you trust me!
We have to stop hiding things from each other.
The man I fell in love with would know that.

Can you fix it?

Remember how you said this arrow will lead me to gaze upon the person I love most?

There.
That's much better.
Now it will lead me to gaze upon the person I hate most.
