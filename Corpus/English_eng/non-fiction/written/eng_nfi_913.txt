Okay, so this is what happened last time on Star.
Carlotta Brown from Mixed Harmony!
- How long has it been?

Refute the demons inside this child.
You set me up.
Oh, hell no, Jahil, she can't stay here.
Regardless of what you think, I like your son, and I'm gonna fix whatever it is you messed up in him.
MOSES:

Somebody uploaded a video of you singing with the girls at the rally.
I'm expanding our audience.
I'm adding Eva to the group.
- Hey, hey, hey!

What's it gonna be, Eva or Star?
I got to go with Star.
(heart beating steadily)

Alex and Simone,
I like what I'm seeing.
Simone, other than you coming in early at that one place,
I-I think it's looking really good.
Hell, you keep this up, you might even be one of the final five.
All right, I'm gonna make some phone calls.
Why don't y'all take a minute, come back and take it from the top, all right?
You got to be kidding me.
We just danced in a chair.
Go get some water, you'll be all right.
- And I wasn't early.

What about me?
What about you?
You know you're good.

So that's how it's gonna be?
How's that?
Ignoring me.
Dismissing me, acting like I'm not even here, when you're clearly obsessed.
The only reason you shacked up with that ho in the first place...
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to call your niece a ho... is 'cause I'm with Hunter.
Just admit it already.
For the record, the only one I was obsessed with was your mother, not you.
You?
I thought you might be a good ride in the sack, but Hunter said you ain't even that.

RICKEY SMILEY:

CARLOTTA:

- Five of these groups gonna be fighting - ... for your touch-up.
over a million-dollar record deal!
You do not want to miss this.
It's The Rickey Smiley Show.
Can you believe Ms. Armstrong still want a weave and highlights?
I'm just getting her hair to grow back from that other place.
C, how come you didn't tell me somebody got killed?
So we holding tea from each other. (chuckles)
Police come around here asking questions, ain't no telling what you gonna say with your big-ass mouth.
And you wearing stolen clothes.
- Uh-uh.

- Uh-huh.

You slippin', Bruce.
I saw it, I had to have it, honey.
I know one thing: we need another receptionist around here.
Since Cotton been gone, it's been crazy.
My book's been all over the place.
I'm doing the best I can as a mother.
Am I blaming you?
Cotton is very well aware of the streets, honey.
Yeah, but I don't want her to find out the way I did.
(snorts) Cotton been found out.
I'm so sorry to tell you.
She'll be back home.

Ain't nobody finna deal with her that long.
(door opens)
Oh, here go that little Latin girl that don't do nothing.
EVA:

I'm here about my pay.
Well, can you clean up tonight?
Those girls are rehearsing for that thing.
Yeah.
What happened to your face?
Nothing.
What happened?
Star.
She got mad I was in the group.
So... she made Jahil choose.
He chose her.

JAHIL:

Van Evans from NextFest.

Yeah.
Excuse me.

I was trying to finish up the last touches on these jumpers.
Michelle hates it when I sew.
- You like it?

- What's up, what's up, baby?

Just a little Molly.
Cotton, you look a damn mess.
But-but I feel good.
High as hell and can still sew your ass off.
Girls, can I talk to you?
- What's wrong with you?

Uh, I think it's best coming from you.
Jahil, what's going on?
Ladies, hi.
I'm Van Evans from Atlanta NextFest.
Hi.
Hi.
I was just explaining to your manager that we don't allow for any last-minute changes.
Wait, what's that s-supposed to mean?
I signed y'all up as a, as a... as a four-girl group.
- When?

I told all of you I was gonna add Eva, to-to add a Latin flavor.
I-I put it in writing with the Atlanta NextFest.
Then you need to unwrite it.
I'm sorry, guys.
Okay?

When Jahil mentioned he wanted it back to a trio,
I had to let him know it's over my head.
It's done.
Get back to me with how you want to proceed.
I need to know by the end of day tomorrow.
- Wait, homeboy, come back.

Are you kidding me?
Jahil, I swear to God, if you do not fix this,
I will call my father and he will bury you.
We can fix it, all right?
- How?

Hell no.
- What other choice we got?

How are we supposed to do anything good if you're sitting here changing the group dynamic every five minutes?
We've been a trio this entire competition.
You heard the man.

- You know what, I'm really tired - (groaning) of hearing your excuses!
- Star...

- You want to forfeit this whole thing?

'Cause if you want to do that, that's what we can do!
All that hard work right down the drain!
- I don't care!

Ugh!

Take me home.
I said I'm high!

Let's go, Cotton.
You three, decide.
He's right.
We have to add Eva back in, if we want to stay in this.
I'm not asking her back.
If we win this thing, we can write our own ticket.
And get a new manager.
We have come too far to let this slip away.
You know that's not his niece, right, Alex?
They're sleeping together.
And the bitch speaks perfect English.
Better than me.
Okay, well, so what, Star?
You know what, you dragged me into this dream, and now I want it just as much as you do.
So get up off your ass, let's go talk to Eva, and let's win this competition.
She should still be working.

Can't even believe I'm doing this.
She's not about to get any input on wardrobe, choreography, songs... nothing.
- Okay, all right, just chill.

I cannot believe I fell for that niece story.
I wasn't expecting y'all back for another hour.
- How was rehearsal?

She left a little while ago.

Long story.
Okay, well, dinner's on the stove.
Simone, eat.
Then I'm gonna take you to your recovery meeting.
SIMONE:

Stop acting like a alley cat, Star.
I don't even know what I did.
Where are you going?
To talk Derek out of using his public defender.
I thought you conned your mother into getting him a real lawyer.
Yeah, well, Miss Ruby had other ideas.
Hmm, Miss Ruby always does.
I'm sorry, dude.
All right, well, if Eva's not here, I'm out.
I'll see y'all at rehearsal in the morning.
JAHIL:

We can try convincing her then.
I'm sure you'll spend all night trying to convince her, Uncle Jahil.
(coughs)
You're not sleeping with that girl, are you?
What?

Yeah, okay.
Hey, uh, Lottie, you got a minute?
If you got problems with them girls, I'm not gonna intervene.
That's between you and them.
No, it's, uh... it's Cotton.
What?
I don't know.

I'm worried about her.
You don't get to worry about her.
Look, she's a good kid.
But I know she's had some problems with drugs in the-in the past.
I just wanted you to know before whatever she's going through gets out of hand.
That's it.
Cotton is my business, not yours.
Now, get out of here.
Night, Lottie.
(door opens, closes)
I don't care if it's a public defender.
If he's gonna go to trial, it's gonna be with a black attorney.
And that's that.
But thank you, baby.
Miss Ruby.
This is your life we're talking about.
- A public defender?

And I'm grateful Moses got me out, don't get me wrong, but I am not taking your parents' money.
You got that right.
What were you saying about the surveillance footage?
Moses only relied on police reports.
He never subpoenaed any of the surveillance cameras in the surrounding area.
Okay, so there could be surveillance footage of the protest before stuff got crazy.
Wouldn't the cops have used that for their own investigation?
That's what I plan to find out.
And if they did, the question is: why haven't they shared it?
We all know why... if there's nothing there pointing in my direction, they'd look stupid.
With that kind of evidence, we could possibly get all charges dropped,
- and you could get back to your life.

It's a long shot, but it's a start.
- Keep a low pro till then.

HUNTER:

STAR:

Oh.

- Ow!

It's not funny.
God!
Why are we making out in a car when you have a house?
This is not high school.
Well, let's... try something a little different.
Okay, we can try something different in a really comfy king-sized bed.
That'd be great.
Well, let's go to the Four Seasons.
Why?

What?

Excuse me.
- No, where'd you get that?

- Hey, where'd you get that from?

Oh, my God, your mother?
Really?

I'm just tired of listening to you two arguing all the time.
So grow a pair.
- With you or her?

I get it, babe.
Y'all are close.
It's Norman Bates creepy, but I get it.
But she needs to learn to stay on her side of the house, just like I stay on mine.
- That's it.

So you want to go back to the house?
Okay.
Really?
You agree?
Would I be here if I didn't?
I hate you just as much as you hate me.
Told you guys she was adorable.
Star, you promised.
STAR:

I just want to break it down for her so she understands that this is the best deal she's ever gonna get.
- May I?

So it turns out your sugar daddy over there...
My uncle.
Right.
When you manipulated your uncle into letting you sing at the protest...
I saved your ass.
... he made us into a foursome for some unknown reason.
So now Atlanta NextFest is expecting a four-girl group.
JAHIL:

Whoever was listed as part of the group at the time makes up the group going forward.
So you can't perform without me.
Oh, and she's a genius.

And you can't get your foot in the door without us.
And yes, you're part of the group.
Can we start rehearsing now, or what?
She's willing to play nice if you are.
So can we wrap this ego-fest up, please?
We're handing you everything you never worked for on a silver platter... you're welcome.
JAHIL:

We are now a four-girl group.
And we need a new song, like, yesterday.
So do you want to keep beefing or get this money?
The choice is yours.
So, you know, given our history,
I-I just want to take the time to say...
I appreciate you seeing me right now,
Pumpkin.

You were gonna keep blowing up my phone if I didn't.
What you want?
There's something I been working on for a long while now, but I need a producer like you to help me break it down to a four-part harmony, and you got the touch, right, when it comes to girl groups, so...
Man, you still runnin' the same old game.
- What?

- Come on, now.

All that mess you pulled with Mary.
And I can't even count how many times you screwed over Carlotta.
Well, I didn't exactly have my head screwed on straight at the time,
- you know what I'm saying?

(laughs) Okay.
Look, call it, um, a second chance or whatever.
I figure if I can make it right with Mary's girls, maybe I can redeem myself in their eyes in some way, you know?
Now, that's a tall order.
'Cause you were such a dick!
But, Jahil, I'll tell you what.
I like those girls.
So let's see what you got.
Now, don't bring me no wack tracks.
I don't got no time for that.
(upbeat pop music playing)
A'ight, a'ight.
(music stops)
I see somebody got their swagger back.
What, you... y-you're gonna do it?
I'll do it for Mary and Carlotta.
I got to give you a kiss.

No, you will not put your lips on my lips.
Thank you, Pumpkin.
- Thank you, Pumpkin.

- You're still the same.

Yeah, whatever!
Look, hey...
Don't worry, okay?
The truth will come out and you will be exonerated.
- I can feel it.

I'm just ready for my life to get back to normal.
That's it.
I think I can help with that.
- Yeah?

You think?

(laughs)
Derek Jones.
Yvonne Turner with Fox 6 News.
I was hoping I could ask you a few questions about the riot that happened a week ago?
I threw a peaceful protest that was just co-opted by some idiots trying to mess something up.
Why don't you go find them and ask them the questions?
Get the hell out of here!
Okay, Derek, just calm down, okay?
Maybe Ms. Crane has something she'd like to say.
Wha...?

Nothing about whether or not your father, Roland Crane, plans to go after the cop that roughed you up during a routine traffic stop?
- What the hell is she talking about?

- What is she talking about?

DEREK:

He's not gonna budge, but if I get her alone... (keys clatter)
You ain't tell me that's what happened.
That cop ain't had no business putting his hands on you.
Look, you need to focus on getting cleared.
Once your lawyer looks at that footage, it'll all be behind us.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm sorry, baby, but we can't just put it behind us.
That's not how it works in the real world.
Just promise me you'll let this go.
I can't promise you that.

Officer Jay Lassiter.
He's had multiple complaints filed against him over these past three years, but he's still policing the Atlanta streets.
Wait, Lassiter... is he the one
- who stopped Alexander Crane?

And many other people, too, but what I'm trying to say is that it's cops like him that give others a bad name.
A big profile on him would get the people of Atlanta paying a little more attention.
We can get his ass knocked down to desk duty.
All right.
Thanks for the tip; we'll be in touch.
But... you know if I go with this story, it-it might come back on you.

Stop saying that!
Who is that?
Congratulations, baby.
Thank you.

- I'm so proud of you.

- Sorry I'm late.

I couldn't make it from work.
ALEXANDRA:

- Thanks for being here.

- Mmm, you look yummy.

Come on, let's get out of here.

Okay, but I think we were gonna celebrate, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll get you back on time.
- Come on, let's go.

Are you good?
Can you get a ride home with Alex or Jahil?
- Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, I got you.
All right, later.
Bye.
See ya.
Yo, Alex?
EVA:

(laughs)
All right, all right.

- Okay.

- Hunter.

Keep your eyes closed.

- Okay.

- Don't fall.

- Hey, don't cheat, don't cheat.

No cheating, no cheating.

(laughs)
(laughs):

- And... yeah.

- All right, all right, ready?

- Ready?

Baby, this place is amazing.
What do you think?
I think it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
What is it for?
I just bought it.
Really?

I just...
I just bought us a house.
This is for us?
I put it in your name.
(gasping softly)
What?
What's wrong?
(sniffles)
Don't you like it?
(sighs)
I do.

Nobody's ever done anything like this for me before.
Nobody's even been this nice to me.
I don't even know how to act.
(crying softly)
I'm sorry.
Star.
You deserve it.
(dog barking in distance)
(door slams shut)
(quietly):

Star, where have you been?
Jahil and Eva... they've been playing us this whole time.

What are you talking about?
You know this whole foursome thing and having Eva's shady ass added to the group?
Yes, I recall.
Yeah, well, it's all a lie.
- I heard them bragging about it.

I hate being right all the time.
So that guy who came to rehearsal wasn't even from NextFest;

This is low, even for Jahil.
- I...

- Yo, I'm gonna go confront their asses.

We have the element of surprise on our side.
Okay, but they did make us look like fools.
I understand that.
But they don't know what we know, so we're gonna take this and use it to our advantage.
And you better believe, we're gonna make them regret trying to play us.

What's wrong?
You've barely said two words since we got in the car.
I'm good.
If anything, I'm just anxious about the attorney.
Henson still hasn't called?
Bad sign, right?
It's only been a couple days.
That's enough time to be looking at some surveillance footage.
I just hope I didn't mess nothing up.
Mess what up?
♪ But what don't kill me... ♪
Oh, my God, Derek, what did you do?
Derek, what happened?
I talked to the news reporter.
You decided to make a statement now... before you knew you were in the clear?
All I did was gave a tip to the reporter on the cop.
- So you go to a news reporter?

If the cops won't do what's right, we'll try them in the media.
I told you to stay away from this!
Why would you take that chance?
- Because I love you.

JAHIL:

- Let's go.

What's going on with you, Cotton, huh?
How you gonna show up at the club so high like that, huh?
I mean, do you even care about what's going on with those girls anymore, huh?
How'd they do?
Well, they were moved on, of course.
- I'm their manager.

But listen, but you ain't ready.
- You ain't ready for them.

No, 'cause whatever's going on with you has got more to do than what's going on with some dude.
Don't worry.
Hey, why the hell would you bring me here?
- This is where...

This is where you belong.
Your mother... she loves you.
No, then she need to act like it and let me do what I need to do.
Well, you're good at what you do.
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, hey, no.
No, Cotton, listen.
I'm talking about your designing stuff, okay?
You are a badass.
But you got to stop the hustle.
And thank you for always taking care of me.
Hey, hey, hey, no.
Look, I love who you are as a person,
I think you're a beautiful woman, you're very talented, but... that's it, that's all, okay?
Yeah.

Stop!
Get off of him.

What have you done?

Cotton!

What?

Help me, Jesus.

What-what... what you want me to do now?

What now?
