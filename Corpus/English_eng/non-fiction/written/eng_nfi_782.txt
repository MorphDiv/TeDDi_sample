( Music playing )
What the fuck?

Marnie, what the fuck?

Like, 1:00 AM.
You were just asleep for, like, 13 hours.
How did you get in?
If you think your country windows are secure downstairs, think again.
What are you doing here?
I would like to help you raise your baby.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
You're about to go through an incredibly intense, emotional, tough, but miraculous transition.
And I would like to be here to help and support you.
Well, this is just like Adam's pitch and that didn't work out so great, so.
No, no, no.

Currently living in my mom's home gym...
- Mm-hmm.

But the thing is, I still have a lot to give, a lot.
So, why not give it to you and this little angel?
I don't know, Marnie, this is just...
You think you have a lot of friends, right?
- Yeah.

Depends on the day.
Elijah's not here.
Jessa sure as hell isn't here.
Adam isn't here.
Shoshanna literally despises all of us.
Who's here?
I'm here.
I win.
I'm your best friend.
I'm the best at being your friend.
I love you the most.
Okay.
Yeah?
Yeah, okay.
Fuck, yeah!
( Music playing ) *GIRLS* Season 06 Episode 10 "Latching"
( baby crying )
( cooing )
Hannah:

- It's okay, Grovey, it's okay.

Okay, and you disinfect the scale between babies, right?
Okay, 13 pounds.

- He's a nice size.

Okay, but he was closer to 10 when he was born, so I'm just a little confused.
Babies will often lose 10% of their birth weight in the first few weeks.
- It's nothing to be concerned about.

As long as he's feeding normally.
Oh, no, he's eating.

- Breast milk or formula?

Is there a chance we could talk to Dr. Monoghan?
She's on vacation right now, looking at a waterfall with her family and I'm not calling her.
It's just, like, she knows our whole story and she's met Grover...
Would you want to be disturbed on your family vacation?
Well, just depends on priorities.
Like, I write through my whole vacation.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
He breastfed for six weeks,
- then he just, like, stopped.

Oh, my God, yeah, I'm pumping so much.

He just... he will only take it from the bottle.
Well, so long as he's getting it.
But isn't there, like, an issue with bonding?
Like, isn't it important?
- Shh.

Breastfeeding is mysterious.
Sometimes it's a piece of cake.
And sometimes, there's something, the chemistry, the fit...

Okay.
Um, well, I guess that's it.
Um, if you have any lollipops?
( baby crying )
Hey.
- Hi, how did it go?

I mean, they said he's basically the perfect weight, so.
You are?

That's, like, the greatest compliment a person can get.
Hi, baby.

I mean, I don't trust that, like, temp doctor.
Yeah, everyone here looks pretty fucking formula-fed to me.
Aunt Marnie's here.
Aunt Marnie's here.

Hannah:

But you told him you've been pumping, right?
Yes, I told him I've been pumping, and I said I don't know how much longer I can do it.
I was like, "My nipples hurt.

What am I gonna do when I start my job next month, like, tote a breast pump around?
What if there's a student I want to fuck?
Promise me you're not gonna give up, okay?
There's a reason they call breast milk liquid gold.
Well, if you really felt like that, I think you would agree to taste mine, so.
Hannah, you have to stop asking me to do that.
It's nice, it's like hemp milk or something.
Babies that are breastfed are less likely to get sick when they're little.
And also, they show higher cognitive function at an earlier age.
And I just saw a study that says that they snag higher-paying jobs.
- What about that doesn't sound great?

That's exactly my point.
I was breastfed for two years.
Great, it seems like it worked out super great for you.
It did.

( Grover crying )
Sorry.
( car approaching )
( birds chirping )
Hey, little man.
Listen, I'm really sorry about before.
I really don't want to talk about it.
Yeah, but we should talk about it.
You yelled at me for loving music.
There's honestly nothing to talk about.
( train horn blaring in distance )
I love that you love music.
Come on, Grover.
Come on!
It's good.
There's a businessman who'd pay a lot of money to do this.
- ( crying )

You don't have to cry 'cause it's right here.
- ( squealing )

You think you're the first man who rejected this?
Well, think again, you're not being very original.
You know what, you're being kind of a fuckhead.
You're being kind of a little bit of an asshole.
I don't know what to say to you.
- ( crying ) - ( exhales )
- ( sneezes )

And that is a swaddle.
- ( cooing )

- Baby.

- ( Grover crying )

Okay, here.

- Hi, favorite boy!

Hello.
Hi!

Oh.
That's another way to do it.
Yeah.
( crying )
( sighs ) Are you making an envelope with your nipple, Hannah?
Are you making an envelope with your nipple?
Do you even have a nipple?
'Cause I've known you a long time and I actually don't think I've seen it.
How the fuck do you make an envelope with your nipple?
Anyway, it's pronounced "enn-velope."
Just, like, don't be so pretentious.
So, apparently, you just fold it down from the base of the areola, and then rather than pushing his face onto the breast, just squeeze a little bit of milk out onto the tip of the nipple,
brush his lips across the nipple so that he decides to take it.
Okay, I need this to stop.
Because, A...

Hannah, do not get stressed, especially when you're holding Grover.
He can sense it.
Cortisol and a million other super powerful hormones just flow through your body.
Somehow, you've just gotta stay centered.
Clear your head.

This is a sacred time.
So, now it's my fault?
Like, my stress is repelling him?
Listen, he's hungry, let's just give him a bottle and then he'll, like, torture animals and keep a room like in the movie "Room."
I don't care.
I think your sense of humor could be a very powerful tool during this journey.
- ( crying )

- Shh.

He did it for a whole month.
He just forgot what was good for him.
- Didn't you, Grovito?

Your, like, desire to be part of this is actually starting to feel really perverse.
I feel, like, very objectified and I just would like some privacy.
Oh, it says if you need assistance, you might ask someone to help press by placing her fingers or thumbs on top of yours.
- Do you want me to come help?

Nope.

( crickets chirping )
( TV playing )
Hello, Information?

( laughs )
John Stamos has not aged a single day.
It's insane.

Hello?
How rude.
The question is, like, could the Olsen twins have become fashion moguls without "Full House,"
or like, is it what catapulted them?
So, I've been thinking and I might wanna go out tomorrow night.
There's a wine bar in Tivoli.
I looked it up, and there's gonna be, like, a live jazz trio playing.
- A live jazz trio?

Marnie, that's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard.
The only thing grosser than a jazz trio would be, like, a jazz quadrangle.
This is empty, by they way.
There's gonna be, like, a flight of local cheeses, and... and then there's gonna be this, like, awesome Sonoma wine pairing.
And you learn about wine, and...
Yeah, but there'd be, like, no way I could come with you.
No, yeah, just I would go.
So, I would just, like, stay here with Grover all night by myself?
Never mind.

Well, is it like, a weekly thing?
Like, if it happens, like, next week...
I don't know, Hannah.
If you really want cheese, we can buy cheese and, like, put on jazz.
I just... we don't have to go to a place.

- ( thuds ) - ( Grover crying )
He hates me.

I don't know what I did to him besides... grow him in my body for nine months.
But he hates me.
The guy at the ShopRite is more interested in my boobs than he is.
So, why don't you just swaddle him, give him a bottle.
There's nothing I can even do for him anymore.
I don't know what to say.

- I can't do anything.

- ( crying continues )

- Come here.

Shh, shh, shh.
( trilling )
( coos )
( birds chirping )
( Grover crying )
Loreen:

( crying continues )
Are you awake now, Hannah?

Oh, good morning.
Grover's been awake for almost three hours.
( groans )
Ooh.

♪ Little man, little man. ♪
- You called my mom?

You called my mother and you told her to come here.
Yeah, Hannah.

Well, it's not helpful.

All she did was complain about how unfair the judging process on "The Voice" is.
She's not helpful.

Okay, well, then, I didn't call her here for you.
I called her here for me.
I wanted some help.

I'm doing my best.

But honestly, it's too much.
And you're not even acting that mature!
You begged to come here.
You wanted to be here with me and help me.
And now it's not matching up to what you imagined, which was, like, that it would be a "Laura Ashley" catalogue.
Or, like, a fun, zany sitcom starring Brittany Snow and the rest of the cast of "Pitch Perfect,"
just carrying a cute, little baby.
- ( crying )

I'm sorry you didn't meet, like, a hot woodworker.
But this is reality.

And you suck at it, okay?
You're doing a bad job, and the reason you are is 'cause you're the immature one, so check that out!
All right, Ghostbuster.
- ( crying )

( water sloshing )
I don't know when my vagina and my butthole are gonna start to feel like two separate entities again, but I'm really looking forward to that.
Loreen:

It'll be like a blip.
Things will get so much harder, you won't even remember this part.
God, I hope you're right.
Listen, Hannah, when I had you, I couldn't breast feed.
No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get you to latch on.
And my nipples both inverted and it hurt like fire in my tits.
- Really?

Obviously, your father was no help at all.
- He was scared enough of breasts as is.

And all these women in my campus mothering circle were so judgmental.
It was the 80s, you know.
All these cunts in linen pants who were so pleased not to be using formula.
I mean, I was raised on formula.
Nice post-war formula.
What's the fucking problem?

Yeah, but don't you get it?

I want him to turn out better than fine.

- He's so much more beautiful than me.

But honey, he'll be fine, whether you use formula or milk,
- or, you know...

I'm mentally ill,
I'm overweight,
I isolate people,
I'm a quitter.
So, what if that's the kind of man that I raise?
What if that's the only kind of man I can raise?
- That's not gonna happen.

And I'm still fucking bleeding.
From my vagina.
No one understands!
You think no one understands you?
Yeah, I do, because I made a very intense choice to take this on all by myself, okay?
I decided to be brave and just go it alone...
Mom, I buckle my bra every day, okay?
But just do it for a second.
You know?

And Marnie acted like she was here to help me, and now all she does...

And now all she does is judge me and bully me, you know?
But she wouldn't if she knew what it was like to be rejected by your own child like you've been rejected by every other fucking man in your life.
'Cause let's face it, Grover fucking hates me.
You really upset Marnie, you know?
She called me weeping.
I got on a plane at 5:00 AM.
- I upset Marnie?

Well, maybe she should have thought a little before she came out here to help, considering that things might get pretty fucking intense.
'Cause you know what, Mom?
I tend to get pretty fucking intense.
Yeah, well, maybe she thought you'd act like a fucking grown-up.
What?

You want to act like this whole thing was an accident?
Like it happened to you?

But that's not honest.
You made a choice to have this child, and guess what?
It's the first one you can't take back.
You can't get your tuition refunded.
You can't break the lease.
You can't delete his phone number.
Your son is not a temp job.
He's not Adam.
This is it, honey, and this is forever.
Stop following me!
And why are you judging me and putting words in my mouth?
Why are you judging me?
Because you just said your baby hates you, and that is the most moronic thing I have ever heard.
He doesn't hate you.

He's a goddamn baby, and you are all he has.
I don't understand why you're yelling at me when I'm in emotional pain.
Yeah, well, you know who else is in emotional pain?
- Who?

For their whole lives!
Nobody said this was gonna be easy.
Nobody guaranteed this would be fun.
You didn't sign a contract in the womb saying you were headed for Six Flags.
- What are you making?

- to do it successfully.

( stammering ) Hah!
I don't understand, Mom.
You didn't say it was gonna be this hard.
Oh, have I made this look easy to you?
No.

Maybe they would have if you'd chosen a husband who wasn't gay and who actually loved you.
And then I would know what, like, a normal, functional family looked like, and I wouldn't be up here with Marnie acting like that was normal.
You know?
And this house would be a home and not just a fucking bunch of rooms.
So, thank you.
No, thank you, Hannah.
- Thank you so much for that.

- Thanks, baby girl.

Oh, man.
( birds chirping )
Hey, are you okay?
I'm not a hooker.
No one said you were.
Sorry for trying to help.
God fucking damn it.

- Am I English?

- No.

- ( mechanical buzzing )

We're, um...

- approaching cruising altitude.

Is, uh... is everything okay back there, Shelly?
( imitates British accent ) Yes, except... there's been a slight disturbance in the cabin.
Yes, I noticed that someone was ringing the, uh...

Yes, 11-C has a problem with his... his dick.
- ( buzzing continues )

Should I go help him with his dick?
- He's in 11-C.

I think you should probably go back there and make sure he's all right.
Yes, do you think I should use the oxygen mask on his dick?
Yeah, I think...

Marnie, I think we're out of breast milk.
Yes, I've already told him that.
- Shelly?

( labored breathing ) Shelly,
- this is your captain speaking.

( imitates British accent ) I'll be right there.
Okay.
Damn it.
Oh, I used the last bag of breast milk earlier.
So, we'll just have to wait till Hannah gets back.
Ugh.
I have no idea when she'll be back.
- Yeah.

Yeah, I don't even know why we have that here.
Sorry I walked in on you beating off.
( chuckles ) No, you didn't.
Masturbating.

No, you did not catch me touching myself.
Okay, Marnie, sure, but, you know, I live alone.
I ain't judging.
No, no, no, no.

Who is he?
( clicks tongue )
His name is Delvin, Delvin P.
He's from Weehawken, and he's a very nice personal trainer.
( chuckles )
Hey.
Are you happy here?
With Hannah and Grover?
I mean, yeah, sure.
I don't need to be happy.
Why?
It's just not my time.

Hannah's my best friend.
Has it ever occurred to you that the best thing for you and your friendship would be if you were happy, too?
Hannah and Grover can't do this by themselves.

Listen, I spent 30 years supporting my best friend.
You know?

But mostly, we just got angrier and angrier until all that was left was hate.
I hate my best friend now.
And all because I didn't know how to let him go.
( exhales )
You know, these ingredients aren't even that bad.
( crickets chirping )
( dog barks )
( door slams )
Girl:

( crying )
Hey!
- Are you okay?

Okay, you can talk to me, it's okay.
I'm safe.

Do you have a phone, ma'am?
- Ma'am?

No, I'm sorry.

Well, then, what makes you a... a safe person?
I don't know.

What... what happened?
I ran away as fast as I could.
It was an emergency incident.
Okay, you cannot be out here without any shoes or pants.
- You just can't.

Here, take these.

Come on.

Look, put them on.
( groans )
Some jeans.
Here you go.
Thank you.
These are kind of big.
Well, yeah, they're big on me, too, obviously.
Just... what happened?

( sighs ) I just need a phone so I can call my boyfriend, Justin.
( sniffles )
Would you like to come to my house and use the phone and call Justin?
Yeah.

Thanks.
'Cause, like, Justin really, really worries when he can't locate me.
Yeah, I'm sure.

Does your mom know where you are?
I'm sorry.

Can you tell me about the incident?
Do you feel unsafe?
Yeah.
My mom said I had to finish my history homework before I went to Justin's.
And I was like, "It's not due till Friday."
And she was like, "Well, you're gonna finish it up right away."
And I was like, "No!" And I ran out.
And then what happened?
And then I was like, "If it's due on Friday,
I'm not finishing it on Wednesday, and that's final!"
( sighs, sniffles )
So, you ran away because your mom asked you to do your homework?
Yeah.
And Justin's gonna be at an away game tomorrow so I won't even get...

( crying )
Okay, give me back my jeans.
What?
I said, give me back my jeans.
What the hell?
No, you said you were gonna help me.
Yeah, that's when I thought you were being, like, fiddled with by your stepdad or something.
- What?

Both:

But that's her entire job.
That's her job in the world.
She has a million trillion things she'd rather be doing.
Things she might want to experience.
Life things she hasn't enjoyed yet.
But she stays and tells you to do your homework because it's what's fucking good for you.
What do you think your mom's gonna do when you get home?
I don't know.

Exactly!

She'll take care of you forever even if it means endless, endless pain!
So give me back my jeans!
No, you psycho lady!
Oh, you run, you little harlot.
Run as fast as you can, okay?
But life is gonna chase you, it's gonna chase after you with problems you can't even imagine.
And I'd be chasing you, too, if my vagina wasn't so busted from having a baby.
So go and just fuck the shit out of Justin!
Fuck him for me!
That's not how I meant that!
( car engine starts )
( siren blares )
- ( dispatch chatter )

Yeah, absolutely.
Do you live near here?
Yeah.

So, uh, what brings you out here without pants and shoes?
Oh, um, I had a baby pretty recently, so.
Mm.

Well, why don't you get in the back of the car and I'll give you a ride home.
I'm really good, but thank you.
( officer over P.A. system ) Just making sure you're getting home okay.
Just take your time.
( dispatch chatter continues )
I guess it's time for me to start figuring out what's next.
Any ideas?
A piece of me has always wanted to go to law school.
( groans ) So boring.
- ( chuckles )

It's a start.
It's mostly because I just love the idea of all the rules.
I fucking love rules.
Maybe you should be a judge.
Hmm.
I have this friend that's a judge.
She is such a gas.
Judge Patricia DeMango.
( chuckles )
She goes on five Christian Mingle dates a week.
- No way.

Spray tan, big diamond in her upper ear cartilage.
But she is a really good judge.
- Mm.

( officer over P.A. system ) You get home safe, now.
Hannah:

Hi.
Hi.
What happened to your pants?
You know, kind of what you'd think.
( train horn blaring in distance )
Thanks.
Where's Grover?
He's upstairs asleep in your room.
We gave him formula, and he liked it.
Good.

( Grover crying )
No, no.

I got it.
( crying )
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
