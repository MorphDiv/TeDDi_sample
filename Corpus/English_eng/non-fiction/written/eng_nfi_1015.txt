Jesus.

Come on.

I don't want him to think I don't care about time and stuff.
There's my girl.
There's my Dad.
Dad, this is my boyfriend Martin.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Martin.
Uh, Mr. Gallo.

You're Mr. Gallo.
I know that.
Nice to meet you, Martin.
(SOFTLY) Fuck.
It's really good to see you.
You look great.
You look tired.

- Singapore.

Ever been?
No, I haven't been.
Uh, I...

I also hear that they cane you if you spit in the street.
Uh, not that I like that.

Good evening.

Shall we start with a nice bottle of red?
Uh, Martin has a sulfite allergy.
A sulfite allergy?
Um, it's not that bad, actually.
I just get a little, uh, Hivey.
But I'm fine with water or death.
Okay.

Excellent choice.
And, Martin, are you sure?

Maybe a beer?

Heh.
You sure you don't want something else, Martin?
Mm.

These beets are really well steamed.
(CELL PHONE BUZZES)
I'm sorry.

(GROANS) He hates me.
He doesn't hate you.
He hates me.
He hates me so much, I'm starting to hate myself.
All that matters is what I think, and I'm a fan.
Yeah?
Big fan.
Huge fan.
All right.
MARTIN:

(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
I'll bounce back.
Round two.
Sorry about that.
It's, uh, not a problem.
Looks like a, uh, pretty major deal just went down over there by the bar, huh?
So, Martin, what is it that you do?
Uh, Dad, I told you Martin is a musician.
Right.

Uh, it's the, uh, banjo.
Banjo.

- Heh.

Well, I have a band,
Hysterical Kindness.
It's a bluegrass collective, more Flatt and Scruggs or Punch Brothers than some, you know, poppy Mumford Sonskindof wannabething.
What's wrong with Mumford  Sons?
They're a very successful act, no?
He likes Mumford  Sons.
So where you from?
Well, I was born in Chicago, uh, but I grew up in Guelph.
Guelph?
Uh, Guelph, Ontario.
- Guelph?

Canada.
Guelph?
Okay.
Your folks, what do they do?
Jesus, Dad, what is with the third degree?
Third degree?

You don't mind, do you, Martin?
No.

It's great getting to know someone this, you know, vigorously.
So your parents?
Oh.

He's an environmental activist in Albuquerque.
He's an environmental activist in Albuquerque, Dad.
Deal with it.
I didn't say anything.
I'm sure it's very satisfying work.
He never met a tree that he didn't want to chain himself to.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Sweetie, you have a little, um, salad dressing.
Oh.
Oops.

I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
(BANJO PLAYING)
Could tonight's dinner have gone any worse?
Actually, it could have.
Mm, I guess he could have castrated me at the table.
Last time I introduced Dad to a boyfriend,
I never heard from the guy again, so...
Wow.

Martin, I know he's tough.
But you're not gonna have to deal with him.
I probably won't see him for another year, so...
Oh.
In that case, I think we should make a plan to see him sooner than that.
You'd be up for that?
Absolutely.
I would go through that hell all over again for you.
(POUNDING ON DOOR ECHOES)
(POUNDING ON DOOR ECHOES)
(POUNDING ON DOOR)
(GROANS)
(POUNDING)
- (POUNDING)

I'm coming.
Mr. Gallo?
Ginnie home?
Home?

I mean, uh, she may be home, but, uh...
Ginnie doesn't live here anymore.
We broke up.
Okay.
(SIREN PASSING)
Want to invite me in?
Oh.

Yeah.

Sorry.
I was just, uh, getting some work done.
(DOG BARKING OUTSIDE)
She didn't tell you when we, uh, broke up?
We haven't spoken since Christmas.
Ah.

She's not picking up or returning calls or texts.
I was hoping maybe she'd be here.
Oh, I just, uh...
I just had a little, uh, get-together last month, so-
Don't worry about it.
Just cleaning, anyway.
Yeah.

Did you try Gary and Roberta?
Gary and Roberta?
Yeah.

Do you want any coffee?
Uh, that's... that's okay.

I'm just gonna make some anyway.
So, uh... (BOTTLES CLATTERING)
So when did you two break up?
Uh, about three months ago.
Three months and nine days or something.
I don't...

I'm sure she's, uh...
You said she, uh...

I gave her the heads-up I was coming in last minute, but I never got a response.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Huh.
No, no.

GALLO:

Jimothy.
Like Timothy with a
No.
Jimothy, this is Mr. Gallo,
Ginnie's Dad.
Who?
Ex-girlfriend's father.
Do you have the bong?
What?

What do you mean by that?
The bong, thing I smoke weed out of all day.
Oh, is that... is that...

I was" Yeah, I was looking earlier.
I just didn't...

You're giving me a real Stressy Vibe, man.
- Uh...

- What's going on?

Could you just, um... just take your weird machine there and just let Mr. Gallo and I talk?
Am I wrong?

You're not wrong.
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
I'm having people over tonight, in case you want to hide in your room again.
You can come.
I thought" You know, I thought we said, uh... we agreed, you know, last time, you know, with...

Oh, so I'm not allowed to have people over in my own home?
No, it's cool.

Oh, did you get my message?
What message?
The fiddle player in your band or something came by, wanted you to know you had a show this weekend or something.
Wait.

I think so.
Well, did he say when or where?
Didn't say when.
Didn't say where.
(MUSIC ENDS)
(SIGHS)
You know, I'm not...
Heh.

We're not...

- None of my business.

Okay.
When Ginnie moved out, I needed a new roommate to help cover the rent.
Of course, yeah.

Yeah.

Oh.
Oh, I'll go get that coffee.
Look, Martin, I can see you're, uh, a busy man here.
Tomorrow I have to get on a flight to Geneva.
All I want to do is find my daughter, so if you can just point me to her new place,
I'll get out of your hair.
Uh, we're all out of milk.
And sugar.

You want syrup in your coffee, or is that... is that weird?
I don't want syrup.

Okay.
So do you have an address for this Gary and Roberta?
Uh, no, but they're not too far from here.
Uh, I don't have an address, but I've been over there.
- So it's close?

Yes, it's just a couple blocks that-a-way.
Okay.

NOW?
Yes, now, Martin.

(MUSIC PLAYING)
Fuck.
Fuck this.
Hey, Martin, do you mind if I go on this computer for a minute, check e-mails?
Um, yeah, sure.

Fuck.

H-Hold on!

- (MOANING)

- Uh, you know, I just...

I tell Jimothy not to use my computer, but he does.
(VIDEO STOPS)
Look, Martin, porn is porn, you know, but you gotta hide that shit.
- Put it in a folder or something.

Can't just leave it hanging out there.
You know, I...

Uh, those poor women.
Okay, you want to put on some pants so we can hit the road?
(JET ENGINE ROARS OVERHEAD)
(JET ENGINE ROARS OVERHEAD)
(BIRD SQUAWKS)
Here.

Ahh.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Wasn't ready for that.
Actually, I don't drive.
(THUNK)
What do you mean, you don't drive?
Ah, I don't have my license.
And, uh, also I don't know how.
Nice throw.
How can you not know how to drive in Los Angeles?
A man should know how to drive.
I have a bicycle.
Oh, well, congrats on that.
Yeah, it's actually considered very masculine in the Netherlands.
You know, hey, I haven't really been in touch with Ginnie recently,
- so...

- So I might not come in.

You know, not that we're not friends.
You know, we're still friends.

We're still friends on Facebook.

Martin, where are we going?
Oh, uh, it's just up ahead that-a-way and a second left at the light.
It's one of these.
I can never tell which.
They all look the same.
Voice mail's still full.
It's gotta be this one.
(COUPLE ARGUING)
I hear fighting.
This is definitely it.
(ARGUING CONTINUES)
(POUNDING)
MAN:

'Cause Saturday's my day!
Shit.

- Um...

- Yeah, hey, Martin.

Sorry to just drop by like this.
Yeah, it... it really is...
We're looking for my daughter.
- Ginnie.

This is her father, Mr. Gallo.
Uh, he didn't have her new address.
She, um...
Martin, hi.
Oh.
Uh, they... they're looking for Ginnie, babe.
Um, this is Ginnie's Dad.
- Oh, hi.

I'm Roberta.

Jack, right?
That would be Ginnie's stepfather.
Right.

She's talked a lot about you, too.
(DOG BARKS)
Did you invite them in?
I literally just opened the door.
(SIGHS)
Come in.

Yeah, come on in.

After you.

Mi Casa...

ROBERTA:

Water or Kombucha?
Twig tea?
I have some nice Biodynamic Wine.
Don't bother.

Martin said she was staying here.
She was staying here.
Uh, she left about three weeks ago.
Did you try her cell?
ROBERTA:

Phone is off, mailbox full for a couple days now.
GARY:

Martin, was Ginnie, like, a survivalist, you know?
Like one of those Preppers
- or...

Do you know where she moved when she left here?
Yes.

Ohh.

What was her name?
Martin, you know her.
Um, the jittery girl.
Always looks like she's about to cry.

Mm, doesn't, uh, ring a bell.
Okay, did Ginnie leave an address?
ROBERTA:

I think it's on the fridge.
Uh, Gary, could you get it, please?
(SIGHS)
Please come in.
GARY:

- It's on the fridge!

It's definitely on the fridge.
GARY:

Jesus.

GARY:

It's on the Japanese paper.
Yeah, no.

- but it's not there.

ROBERTA:

Fine.

GARY:

You sure you guys don't want anything, like a...

Sure.

Ah, you know, uh,
I'm fine.

Uh, how have you been, Gary?
(SIGHS) I've been, um... work's good.

ROBERTA:

What tub?

Excuse me.

What tub are you ta...

That's a tin.

- Tub, tin, whatever.

Can I help you find what you're looking for?
ROBERTA:

GARY:

ROBERTA:

GARY:

We'll find it.
Can I get you guys something?
Are you sure?

We have nice cheese.
Oh, we're out of the cheese, babe.
Since when?
Since we finished it.
I didn't finish the cheese, so don't say "we."
I was gonna freeze it for my Doula workshop next month.
It's okay.

Someone finished the cheese, I guess.
Yeah, someone was hungry in their house, and they ate cheese.
They ate it all, though.
It's okay.
Have you seen Ginnie recently?
(ROBERTA SIGHS) Brother.
I certainly have not.
We love Ginnie.
Don't get me wrong.
But some of us loved her a little too much, if you know what I mean, and some things got said.
Yeah, some things got said.

- Yeah, I said 'em, all right.

'Cause someone had to say something, 'cause a certain someone in this house wanted to have sex with his daughter.
- Okay, what?

- No?

And unfortunately, in this house, that makes certain people very insecure.
Okay, let me translate for Mr. Sensitivity over here.
Ginnie was getting a little sick and tired of being leered at every time she went to the fridge.
It was one time, and I was trying to warn her about the bad milk!
Mr. Gallo, Martin, Ginnie was going for some bad milk in the fridge, so I was peering to see what she was grabbing from the fridge, in order to say, "Hey, don't ingest that, Yeah.
'Cause you might get sick." I was doing a service.
You're a knight in shining armor, aren't you, Gare?
Here's an idea.

Ohh!

They're strippers!

You can't stop them!

They're...

Can't stop 'em.
The monkeys climb all over you at a zoo?
Really?

Okay, we should probably get going.
If you find that address, you could give me a shout, that'd be great.
We'll find it.
- Don't worry.

I'm so sorry about the cheese.
You know, it was very expensive cheese.
Jesus, Roberta, he doesn't care about the goddamn cheese.
You, uh, might want to try the cafe.
Martin knows where it is.
She's probably working there.
- The cafe?

Great.

Yeah.

Uh, all right.

Thank you for... that.

Why do you have to attack me?
Why are you... have to be so hostile?
And now I completely lost face.
I gotta go apologize for something I didn't even do.
Hey, Ma-Martin.
Are we cool, man?
Are we...

- truly...

Bro, I would never...
Gary, it's fine.
I mean, you know, we're not even...
I know.

I wouldn't... and, Mr. Gallo,
- I would never...

I'll rest easy now.
You guys are the best.

She's probably there, all right?
Hey, and tell her Gary says, "What's up?"
Okay, so you just wanna go straight until Sunset,
Okay, so you just wanna go straight until Sunset, and then you make a right, and, uh, you can't miss it.
Um, before you drop me off,
I can draw you a little map.
What, are you Dora the Explorer?
Fuck that.

(INHALES) Yeah.
I would love to.
Just apparently I have a show coming up, and I really need to rehearse.
I'll pay you, okay?
Pay me?

You don't, what, need the money?
I beg to differ.
Look, Martin,
I'll be straight with you.
I'm worried here, okay?
This is not like my daughter to just disappear like this.
If you care about her at all,
I would think you would want to know if she's okay or not.
I do.

Of course I do.
Okay.
Tell me when to turn.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
This is where my daughter works?
Yeah.

They got a little gallery now.
It was Ginnie's idea, actually.
Really turned the place around.
(SITAR MUSIC PLAYING)
Nothing.

GALLO:

MARTIN:

(TRACY LAUGHS)
You're the slut.
The old one, maybe.
You're gross.
I have to go.
Call me if it doesn't stop bleeding.
Tracy, hi.
Uh, it's Martin.
Remember me?
No.
Uh, Ginnie's boyfriend.
Ex-boyfriend.
Is Ginnie working today?
Ginnie doesn't work here anymore.
What?

Since none of your business.
I'm her father... trying to find her.
Oh.

Do you know where she's working now?
I think she works at some restaurant.
Lizzie, our manager, would know, but she's at Moglu right now.
Moglu?

Did you check her Facebook?
- Checked her Facebook.

(SCOFFS) Twitter.

You tweet something, will you?
Oh, I don't...

'Course you don't.
Look, um, Tracy, would you mind just putting something out there...
- I already did it.

I tweeted it.
Great.

"Baller old guy, creepy young guy looking for Ginnie G. #random #doable."
I'm creepy?

I've met her many times, many times.
Yeah.

Is this whole neighborhood stoned?
Uh, maybe she was stoned.
You know, this... this neighborhood's probably 70% stoned, 80% on a Sunday.
All right, where's the yoga place?
Uh, just that-a-way.
So, uh, where'd you say you were coming from?
Mumbai.
Oh, Mumbai!
Yeah.

Uh, no, no.

It's a shithole.
Huh.

Well, I guess I can, uh, cross that off the list then.
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
GALLO:

MARTIN:

GALLO:

WOMAN:

Hey, Lizzie.
Martin. (SIGHS)
What are you doing here?
- Uh...

- No.

I was just wondering...

Martin, Martin, Martin...
Oh.

Martin, you've got to get over this Ginnie thing.
She's moving on.

Uh, what do you mean, she's moving on?

Okay, everything is in place.
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
Barry, look, my phone is about to die.
Okay, Barry, stop talking.
I don't think this is the best move for you, Martin, but if you need some kind of closure or whatever, she's hostessing at Bibola.
Bibola?

It's a restaurant, Martin.
It's the new, hot big restaurant in West Hollywood.
Fuck!

- Okay.

Yeah, Martin, you should know that...
Oh, and by the way, good job.

What the hell does that mean, "Good job"?
No, I didn't mean it like...

- What did you mean?

You know, like "Good job, yoga."
- Uh-huh.

Fuck off, Martin.

- Absolutely.

Good-bye.
You're an asshole.
You're an asshole.
Stop talking, Barry.
Just do your fucking job, okay?
(SIGHS) So?
She said Ginnie's working at a restaurant in West Hollywood.
Let's go.
Frank.
- Wow.

Hi.

It's been a minute.
Are you in town for a visit?
Yeah, just popped in.

I'm a sweaty mess, but thank you.
You look good.
How long are you in town for?
Very briefly.
Uh, I'm sorry.

Oh.

Well, it was, uh... it was good to see you.
You, too.
So if you end up sticking around,
- give me a shout.

- Take care, Kelly.

You're gonna catch flies there, Kermit.

Was that that waitress from that night we all had dinner?
I don't know, maybe.

No, I...

- Where we going?

That's gotta be the 15th fucking time you said "that-a-way."
Are you Hopalong Cassidy?
Who's Hopalong Cassidy?
Ha...

MARTIN:

GALLO:

No, I know.

She's very attractive.
Yes.

Okay?

Very attractive.
So how did that work?
Did she slip you her number...
Would you fucking forget about it?

- Jesus.

Maitre d' says she quit about 10 days ago all of a sudden, has no idea why.
She only worked here two weeks.
That is pretty weird.
Yeah, it is.
(SIGHS)
Well, want to grab a bite?
Here?
Sure.

Gotta refuel, right?
I mean, you must be starving.

That's very nice of you.
I guess I am pretty hungry.
Good.
(CORK SQUEAKS)
Oh, yeah, Ginnie.
Yeah, I love Ginnie.

I was bummed when she quit.
But I think maybe she got a better job.
- You know where?

But I can ask around.
That'd be great.

In the meantime, can I get you anything to start?
I think we'll skip straight to the entree.
We're in a bit of a rush.
I'll take the, uh, steak-frites, rare.
I guess I'll have, uh...
You know what?

Excellent.

Uh, yeah, yeah, rare.
Very good.
This place is pretty, uh, chichi.
Yeah, for you, I guess, eating tofu out of a paper bag or whatever.
That is how I usually eat, actually.
She'll turn up, Mr. Gallo.
She will.
Have you, um...
- talked to Ginnie's Mom?

I was just thinking, uh, maybe she's heard from her.
I don't want to worry her.
Right, but, you know, they're pretty close.
I mean, maybe she knows where she is.
And what if she doesn't?
Then she's in a panic.
And whose fault is that?
Yours?
Well, no, it would be yours, actually, because it's your idea.
(SIGHS)
Maybe she lost her phone.

Martin, I get that you think I'm being paranoid here, okay?
But believe me, shit happens every day.
Friend of mine's daughter takes a little trip to Europe.
She gets grabbed 20 minutes out of Orly.
- Jesus.

Lucky for them I know a thing or two about a thing or two.

- A thing or two?

Wait.

- What?

His...

This is not a movie, Martin.

(MARTIN CHUCKLES)
What...

Oh, just, uh...
It just reminds me of...
Ginnie could never explain what you do.
It always seemed so mysterious to us.
We used to joke that you were a, uh, um, an arms dealer or something, you know, something badass.
Well, something like that, but not quite so glamorous, I guess.
So what is it that you do, exactly, then?
I'm in procurement.
Okay.
Huh.
Procurement.
So what about you?

Well, I guess I've got that show coming up with my band.
But I'm not sure that I want to do it.
Not sure?
Well, what's the issue?
Well, it's been a while, and I guess I've been trying to figure some stuff out actually.

What's the endgame?
I mean, I'm probably never gonna make... a real living at it, or at least one decent enough to support a family or...
Are you good at it?
Yeah, I am.
Then you should play the show.
WAITER:

No luck on the Ginnie front, I'm sorry to say.
Well, thanks for trying.
You know, it is Thursday, though.
You know, you might want to try Rococo.
You know her friend Trev?

He's been DJing there every Thursday.
Yeah, I know Trevor.
You know the place?
Enjoy your meal.
Dig in.
(COUGHS, SPITS)
You okay there, bub?
(SPITS, COUGHS)
It's been a while since I ate meat.
Yeah.

(SPITS) Oh, three... maybe five years.
Nobody made you order it.
Tell you what, let's go to that Rococo place, get a drink, settle your stomach, huh?
I guess one drink couldn't hurt.
If she's there, great.
If not, maybe you can point out somebody that knows her, huh?
- You're the Boss.

MARTIN:

We're never getting in.
What, are you kidding me?

(LOCK CHIRPS)
Where are you... (OVERLAPPING CHATTER)
(CAR HORN HONKS)
All right.
He's with me.
Have a good night.
(HOUSE MUSIC BLARING)
How'd you do that?
I spoke the guy's language.
What...

What, you spoke Samoan?
Martin, look alive.
Dennis said he hadn't seen her, but you never know.
Dennis?

Martin, look around.
See if you can spot anyone who knows Ginnie.
No, I don't know, Mr. Gallo.
This really doesn't look like her kind of crowd.
Come on.

Two Taliskers, neat.
You got it.
See anything?
No.
There you go.
(COUGHS)
I think I, uh...
Good.
(MUSIC CONTINUES)
Hey, Megan.
(TIPSY) Oh, my God.

Megan!
What the fuck are you doing here?
I'm looking for Ginnie, actually.
Oh, Martin, you gotta get over it.
It's so sad, like...
No, I'm...

Uh, it's just her Dad is looking for her, actually.
Do you...

- What?

- Who?

Get over it, Martin!
(LAUGHS) 'Kay.
Oh, wow.
She's very drunk.
Yeah.

- Right?

Yeah.

Yes!

Oh, sorry?
I just, uh...

I'm sorry.

Ginnie, my ex-girlfriend.
Yeah.

Sorry.

I know.

I feel like I'm screaming at you.
It probably looks like we're having a horrible, horrible argument.
- Fuck you, you fucking asshole!

I swear to fucking God!
WOMAN:

(NEW SONG BEGINS)
I'm sorry.
- Oh.

It was a joke about arguments.
Oh, man.

I probably went too far.
- No.

I don't think I've seen her in here for a few weeks.
Is she missing or something?
Something like that.
This one's on the house all right?
- Thank you.

She's seeing somebody?
Yeah, cute guy, too, a big tipper.
They met here, I think.
You seen him lately?
No.

Just a second.
So do you come here often?
So do you come here often?
No, never.
It's a little bit too, like...
Axe body spray?
Yes.

Yeah.

I don't know if that's gonna happen.
Yeah, I saw you play, like...

You were really good, kind of like... the Punch Brothers meets, like, the Foggy Mountain Boys meets, like, the Muppets.
Yeah, thanks, I think.
That's at least partially what...

MAN:

Hey, Trevor.
They let you in here?
Yeah.

I know this guy!
He's an idiot!
Hey, um, I think my friend is leaving, so I have to go.
Okay.

Yeah.

'Bye-bye.

Listen, Trevor, have you seen Ginnie recently?
Uh, yeah, I'm just gonna do you a solid and not even answer that, bro.
I don't know what your problem is with me.
Hey, I told you guys about Marty here, right?
He plays old-timey music on his banjo like he's old McDonald or some shit, and, like, 10 people show up.
It's hilarious.

'Cause she's way too fine for your hella broke ass.
I kind of want to punch you in the face right now.
You know, Marty, a woman like Ginnie, deserves to be given the finer things in life.
And there's a long line of dudes who want to give it to her.
(GRUNTS)
Hey, Martin.
- Everything okay?

I was just talking to Ginnie's, uh, friend Trevor, just asking him if he's seen Ginnie.
And?
And I was telling Marty here that the way that girl's been working through their breakup, she could be facedown in any bed in a 10-mile rad... (ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)

Megan said Ginnie had a new boyfriend.
- Yeah.

Bartender at the club said the same thing.
Well, so... we probably won't be finding her tonight, and that's because she's with him.
Look, Martin...
So even if we do find her, find them, how's it gonna look?
I'm tooling around with her Dad.
She's shacked up with her new boyfriend.
So she's dating someone else.

I mean, don't you still want to know that she's okay?
Aren't you at all worried that none of the people we talked to tonight know where she is?
Of course I'm worried about her.
Because I thought you still cared about her.
Of course I still care about her!

Has that not been spelled out enough for you tonight?
Your daughter fucked my shit up.
My life has been a complete wreck for the last three months.
I mean, I can't eat.

All I've literally been able to do... is sleep.
So what do you want to do, go home?
Yes.
Crawl into bed, sleep some more?
Yes, that's exactly what I wanna do.
Martin, I get it.

It sucks, but...
I don't think retreating into your shell is doing you a lot of good.
Listen, I'm telling you this from personal experience, okay?
Life goes by really fast.
If you half-ass it now, you're gonna feel it later.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.

There you go, Juicy.
Since we're, um, exploring our options...
And I know this is a sensitive area, but maybe you could try calling Ginnie's Mom.
I'm not calling Ginnie's mother, period.
- End of story.

All right.
So Why'd you and Ginnie break up?
You know that prizewinning douchebag
Trevor back at the club, he was saying that Ginnie is out of my league.
She's an amazing girl, as you obviously know.
She's smart, beautiful, funny, and tough.
Yeah, and, um...
She is out of my league.
Well... maybe she saw something you don't.
Maybe she did, but I started to get insecure about it, and then I got jealous and moody.
I don't know.
It was my fault.
I just...
I fucked it up.
I fucked it all up.
We all fuck it up sometimes.

Bartender says he's a big tipper.
