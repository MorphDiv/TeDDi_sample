I'm actually a very forgiving person... as long as they admit their mistakes.
Did... did I do something wrong?

Did I mess up the money orders?
No.
Someone robbed my storage unit.
You didn't happen to tell anybody we went there, did you?
No.

Did the others get robbed?
No, they didn't.
What, uh, what about security cameras?
There must be some kind of footage, right?
Yeah, they had footage, but I'd have to file a police report to see it.

We're a family.
You should've told me what we were doing, Baz.
Well...
I didn't know if I could trust you.
I guess we're gonna find out now.
Who robbed my unit?
Y-you were robbed?
Your boss seems too stupid, but you look like the type guy who thinks he's smart.
Lady, I swear, I had nothing to do with it, okay?
Now I can do this all day.
