Stop!
Give me my bag!
Agh!
Stop!

Are you all right?
I need my inhaler.
Oh, God.

Just breathe.

Stay calm.

Are you all right?
Oh...
Thank you, love.

Did you get a good look at him?

No, no, I don't need the fuss.
There was only a couple of quid in me purse.
Madam, I need to report this.
Madam?
She's young.

Strangled?
I haven't moved her yet, but there's a cord round her neck.
Drag marks on the concrete.
Scuffing on the back of her boots.
Maybe not killed here.

I'm guessing not many people come down here.
- Who called it in?

From a phone box on the estate.
It's not a cord.

Get these people out of here!
Move back, please!

Where's Clay?
Twice in three days.
You in love?
You got a message?
I'm reconsidering our arrangement.
Tell him I'm looking for him.
Come on.

You turn up for duty late.

You're supposed to be making up for last week's traffic screw-up so I have something positive to write in your first probationary report.
I was trying to help an old lady.

- Um...

- Golf Hotel, 5-2.

- 5-2 received, over.

Can you attend, over?
5-2 received.

Thank you, 5-2.

There's been a murder.

Body found on the Kingsmead.

Horrible business.
- Sorry, say again, sir.

22 Darnley Road.

- Can you deal?

I've not been around a murder case before.
It's all hands on deck.

One of you, two teas and biscuits to DI Bradfield's office.
Golf Hotel to 5-9.
Maybe clean yourself up while you're at it.
Yeah, reports of suspicious activity.
Morning, Jane.
Ta, love.
I want Uniforms knocking on doors.
Someone knows who she is.
Right.

'Bout bloody time!
Four quid still in her pocket, so I'm ruling out robbery.
The note's been sent to the lab for prints.
We need a name for our girl.

DS Lawrence noticed track marks on her arms.

- Addict?

- I'll start with Drug Dependency Unit.

WPC Tennison, you're testing my patience today.
It's all right.

With her own bra.
- That'll be all.

- Tennison.

Not yet.

Has she done any foot patrol there before?
You worried they'll eat her alive?

- No, I didn't mean --

She's sure she'll be able to handle it, sir.
Five minutes, front of station.
Right, D section lads, you're on the Kingsmead here.
Blake, Doyle, Morgan, Tennison, I want you on the Pembridge over there.
OK, you got the sketch, you know your questions.
Let's get knocking on doors!
Come on, go!

♪ Why do you sleep so still?
Sorry to bother you.

Do you know her?

Police business.

- If you can't speak, a nod or a blink will do.

Thanks very much.
♪ Yes, you will be my fill ♪
Sorry to bother you, ma...
What are you doing here?

- It was only a cheap purse.

It's all right, Ma.

- Sorry to bother you, sir.

Have you seen this woman before?
No.

Maybe your mother?
No.
No.
- I just got a door slammed in my face.

I've got a lead.

Said she used to hang out at the Greyhound pub.
Staff reckon from the description she was an out-patient.
Julie-Ann Collins.

All right, get in.
Suzy, don't run!

Do yourself a damage.
Look, you're all right.
We're not here to bash heads.
Do you know this girl?
Looks like Julie.
- Why?

- What is it?

Oh, no.
When did you last see her?
Not for a couple of weeks.
- She used to work this patch?

How about any bother?
Any creeps giving her a hard time?
What about a pimp?
I don't know.
She used to hang out with this fella.
That druggie?

Told me she was sweet on him.
Can you give me a name and description, madam?
- Madam?

Never know his name.

Oh, yeah.

Think that's why she felt sorry for him.
Thanks, girls.
Take care of yourselves, yeah?
This is her last known address.
Times were tough.
Hold up, how can you not know about Watergate?
President Nixon.
It's none of my business, is it?
- It's all over the news!

Looks like half the junkies on the estate have used this place.
Come on.
All right, lads?

Take that as a yes!

I've lost him!

Stand him up straight.

Your right hand.

Clear the hair.
- Turn him around.

Looks like you've had a bit more than whisky in your jar, son.
Wake him up.

- Stand him on the spot.

Give us your left hand!
Look, pens, yeah?
You... sign your name.
Let's go.
Let's help you out, you half-wit.
You make a little mark there.
Well done.
Right, all done.

Go on!

You stink, the pair of you!
Concentrate, Eddie!
What were you saying, eh?
You were high?
When I turned my ankle.
You told us about your broken ankle, Eddie.

Girls like Julie-Ann have someone looking after them.

I'm her boyfriend.
Who was her pimp, then?

We went to see Oz on the hill.
Who's Oz?
Julie, is she going to be OK?
How do you feel about your girlfriend shagging other people for money?
I hate it.
It's me that took her to the hospital to try and get her clean.

Yeah, you're a real saint.
What have you been up to the last 24 hours?
At home.

Yeah?

The one that ran away.
Who?
When we picked you up, there was three of you.
Billy, you...

I can't think.

Give him time to come down.

May 1st, Eddie takes Julie-Ann to the hospital.
He claims he hasn't seen her since.

Morgan, this Suzy, she claims Eddie and Julie-Ann were lovebirds.
- They got high together.

- Blow for blow-jobs.

Sir, prints from the phone kiosk on the Kingsmead, they don't match Eddie Phillips or Billy Myers.
But we have Missing Persons reports for Julie-Ann Collins.
Latest was last year, July, reported by George Collins.
She was 17.

Address, 48 Church Mount Road.

We're checking, sir.
I need a uniform presence for a next of kin visit.
I haven't done one of those yet.
Can you find me another plonk, then?
No, I didn't mean...
I'll do it.
- Continue straight on, sir.

We're out of traffic now.
Can I ask, sir, when we get there,
I know what your role is.
But um...

How would I do that?
Sorry if I'm asking too many questions.
No, um...

Just do what feels natural.
Grab that envelope from the back seat.
You want me to show this to the family?
No.

So what part of London are you from?
Maida Vale, sir.
What brings a Maida Vale girl to the police?
I thought the force could do with more posh sorts, sir.
Fair enough.
You shouldn't apologise for asking questions.
It's the only way you're going to become a better copper.
Mr George Collins?
- Yes.

I'm Detective Inspector Leonard Bradfield.

Would you mind if we come in, sir?
Um...

Do you have a daughter named Julie-Ann?
Is she in trouble again?
I'm very sorry to tell you that... a girl we believe to be your daughter has been found dead.
What?
The body of a young female was found earlier today on the Kingsmead estate in Hackney.
We are treating it as a murder enquiry.
We need someone to formally identify her as soon as possible.
So you can't be sure that it is her.
Not until she's formally identified, sir, no.
What's this about?
I've got an alternative proposal.
It may take a few weeks to put in place.
But there's a bookie's on the King's Road I'm looking into.
No, we're doing the bank.
One of my boys bumped into your wife.
She put up quite a fight.
You bother me again... .. next time, I'll send two in.
When did you last see her?
Oh...

Over a year ago.
I tried to help.
She wouldn't listen.

Just... hoped she'd come back.
Like other parents' kids do.
Mr Collins?
Yes, it's her.
That's Julie-Ann.
It's all right, Mr Collins.

It isn't our fault.

She rejected us.
'Names which turned out were taken from the spy novels written by their boss.
Hi, Mum.
Have you been at work all this time?
Yes.
Hi.
Why are you so late?

A girl was murdered.
I went on the bereavement visit, and the DI sent me on the house-to-house.
On your own?
Should have called.
Mum, can you knock?
Haven't even looked at your bridesmaid's dress.
Later.

I found these in your dressing gown pocket.
I didn't know you were on the Pill.
Mum, it's 1973.
It's not a big deal.
Your sister's not on the Pill.
(For fuck's sake.)
Jane...
See, this...

You come home late and you're moody.
And you're effing and jeffing!
I'll try to curb the effing and jeffing.
Look at Pam.

So would I be if all I had to care about was shampoo and clippers.
And a wedding.
How can that make you happy?
Because it matters.
When we find the person that killed that girl, it will matter.
We!
Morning, Kath!
- You off home?

Remember the old folk's house in Bishop's Fields that kept getting burgled?
A bloke's been spotted.

- So he's sending me and Edwards from CID.

- Are you going to hold hands?

Oi!

Stop doing your hair.

- Gordon Bennett!

Yeah, Gordon Bennett.
Your first PM already?

Am I?
If you need some tips, maybe we could grab a drink later.
Oh.

All right.
We need the floor plans for the bank.
Look like you've just seen a ghost.
What are you depressing yourself with that crap for?
She was pretty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Know what you got to do?
Yeah.
Just forget about her now, all right?
I'll drop you off, then meet you back home.
Stick to looking at page three.
All right, you can go in now.
How's my boy?
Oh, nice to see you too.
Look at the state of you.
Eyes all bloodshot.
You smoking that crap again?
Mum got mugged.
Is she OK?
Man who done it said it was a message from Clay Whiteley.
We're all in danger now.
It was a misunderstanding.
Your old man sorted it.
John wants the plans.
I'll tell him tomorrow.
Shoes.

Be careful with my stuff.

Which makes it the only thing we found in your flat which is definitely yours.
Nice jacket.

I know my rights.

Agh!
Now you're sober, you can tell us more.
I...

- You took her to the drugs unit in Homerton hospital.

You did, you moron.
Last time I saw her, she wanted to get onto the methadone.
- But then something happened and she panicked.

She left.

Did you see her get into a car?
Yeah.
A red one.
Oh, well, we'll keep our eyes peeled for a red car!
What sort of red car, Eddie?
A Jag.

A red Jag, but you don't know the driver.
Night before last, you kipped over at your nan's.
Nancy Phillips.
- Yeah.

Worth us asking her about Julie-Ann?
Leave her out of this.

Did you kill her?
Who would want Julie-Ann dead, Eddie?
Think.
Shit, he's gonna puke!
Not on my shoes, you little shite!
Call an ambulance!
I knew something weren't quite right.
See this bit of net curtain hanging out the bottom of the window.
I look in and there he is.

Tries to leg it.

I'm out the back...
Oi!

While you were doing all that, I was tackling the suspect to the ground!
Ha ha!
- Edwards, get that locked away in the property store.

Right, Eddie Phillips has given us a lead.
He spotted a red Jaguar pick up Julie-Ann from Homerton hospital on May the 1st.
I want it found pronto.
- On our way.

Eddie Phillips just puked everywhere and it needs cleaning up.

- The sarge wants my arrest report.

Sorry.
Tennison, post mortem.

Looks like I'm on vomit duty, then!
- Nervous?

Nothing like being thrown in the deep end.
- Strangled prostitute.

You met her parents.

Morning, Paul.
Hello, there.
We didn't find anything else at the scene.
Just the money that was in her pocket.
And a cheap beaded bracelet on her right wrist.
These are her white socks, and boots.
We did find some red carpet fibre on the soles of her socks.
And also some on the inside of her boots.
DS Lawrence, I presume you're doing exhibits and photographs.
Mm.
For the paperwork, you are?
Probationary WPC 517G Tennison attached to B Relief, Hackney, sir.
Just name and number will suffice.
This gruff sod's Professor Dean Martin.
Spare me the Rat Pack jokes.
Right, gather round.
- No, thank you.

Try not to drop fag ash on my instruments tray, DI Bradfield.
From the hypostasis and rigor examined on the body at the scene,
I'd estimate she was killed between 6PM and midnight on Sunday the 13th of May.
Cause of death, strangulation?
The knot on the bra was tied so tight, I had to cut it.
And the killer ripped it off her?

- Possibly.

If you need to vomit, the toilets are that way.
The bra is strapless, so it might not have been removed forcibly.
Maybe she took it off beneath her top.
Fair point.
Extensive blue and yellow bruising down the length of the right arm.
Caused by severe blunt-force trauma.
Can we turn the body over, please?
Little lady took an extensive beating to the buttocks and the back.
At the time of death?
No, it's older.
See the difference between the bruising here and the more recent marks on the neck?
I'd estimate ten days old.
- What caused them?

The amount of overlapping injuries suggest whoever inflicted them was in a rage.
WPC Tennison, would you mind crouching down?
Side on, foetal position, facing me.
Raise your right hand.
Palm upwards, as if you were trying to protect your head.
Perfect.
She was struck repeatedly on the lower arm.
And then beaten repeatedly on the buttocks and the back.
She fell and lay prostrate on the floor.
He didn't mean for you to actually do that bit, Tennison.
Right, let's proceed to the fainting part.
Gentlemen, roll her back over, please.
Let's start the internal examination.
This may be another reason your victim wanted to get off the drugs.
A dead foetus in the uterus.
The child might have died at the same time as the mother.
Or as a result of the previous beating.
From the size and development, it's very early stages.
I'd estimate six to eight weeks.

Davey, what have I said about smoking that stuff in here?
It's raining and the damp makes my legs worse.
Then why were you out in it the night before last?
- I wasn't.

I was here all night, Ma.
Whoever she is, she's not worth the bother.
Leave it, Ma.
I need you to write up a PM report on what the professor told us.
Yes, sir.
You did well, Tennison.

- I've explained, madam.

Now who is in charge?
Oi!
You've put my grandson in hospital.
- Can I help, madam?

He ain't got nothing to do with that tart's murder.
- He told you that, did he?

She's covered in bruises.

Couple of months back, he borrowed money for her.
- What?

So some thug come and done a number on him.

What you gonna do about that?
He didn't tell us any of that.
The night before last, was Eddie at yours the whole time?
Yeah, he was.

Oi!

So he lied about his alibi.

If he lied about that, what else did he lie about?
We've got to bring him back in.
Eddie Phillips has absconded.
I want all units out there looking for him now.
Bugger.
Thank you.

Before you go home, pin these to the incident board.
Why do you smell of Dettol?
I was at the mort...
Mortuary.
- We're looking for Eddie Phillips!

Eddie Phillips!
Nothing down here.
- Anything?

He said 'Not in those trousers!

Hello, Suzy.
I'm not sure you should be out working.

Love now, is it?
We're looking for Julie-Ann's boyfriend.
- Have you seen him around here recently?

What was Julie-Ann's relationship with Eddie like?
I didn't know him.
- Was he violent?

Piss off, love.
Sorry I bothered you.
It makes me sick to my stomach that that bastard is out there somewhere breathing, eating, living, while Julie-Ann is in the mortuary being prodded and poked and sliced open.
Help me help her.
Makes me sick too.
Not from round here, are you?
No.
She didn't belong here neither.
She wanted out.
That bastard Eddie had her trapped.
I don't want to say no more.
Eddie!
Mr Collins.
I think we need to talk.
How do you know about Eddie?
The newspaper describes him as Julie-Ann's boyfriend.
There's blood here and here.
I don't know what's going on in that head of yours.
But don't fuck this one up for us, David.
This is a murder investigation.

Next time, I'll take more than just your wife's purse.
I admire you.
Be careful, Jane.
Nothing happened.
Why do you keep using my first name?
You think I'm guilty?
