Translation and subtitles by PEPPER LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER ***
Yeah?
Yeah?
On my way.
Seriously?
It's a holiday.
The bad guys don't take a holiday.
Why don't you sleep?
I was hoping we could talk.
Yeah, I gotta go.
So, you're still upset?
I'm not upset.

I'll call you later.
Monfell shipping center has been not operational for the last six months.
Since its closure, it's become a favorite location for the Sao Paulo Locos to conduct their business.
They pretty much come and go as they please with minimal resistance.
That ends today.
Late last night, a shipping container arrived at Monfell from Bogotá.
Due to the amount of chatter,
DEA believes that this could be their largest shipment of contraband to date.
The source couldn't identify exactly what was coming in, so whether it's money, arms or the ghost of Pablo Escobar...
Be ready, secure the scene...
Help find the container, once you've done that, you all can go enjoy your holiday.
Oh, we're just barbecuing.

How about you?
I really don't have any plans.
- You should come over.

Yeah, Carley and Becky would love to see you.
Not me, I'm sick to death of you.
Sorry to ruin your holiday.
Oh, you ruin everyday, Elle.

Don't call me Elle.
When did this come down?
Got the call from DEA a little after two, why?
A little short notice.
We got shorter.
Yeah.
Don't get that big brain of yours thinking, Trav, it only gets you in trouble.
Inspiring as always.
And don't fuck up!
Let's go.
- Ward?

What's this?
What we're looking for.
- It's pretty.

Why don't you come down to the beach later?

No, I got plans.
- It's your loss.

Why would she want to go to your party?
Aren't you too old for this shit?
Just entered my prime!
Yo, Vince, I'm not doing anything.

Remember what happened last time you came to my house?
- No.

All right, settle down, settle down.
A little calm before the storm, Deputy.
There's not gonna be a storm.
What makes you say that?
Ah, 'cos they've been getting a bit lazy.
You know, we let them do a few scores, now they feel safe.
Mmm.
Now, I guess we got all dolled up for nothing,
[I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHAT THE DEA SAYS]
[WE GO IN HEAVY, STAY FROSTY]
[WATCH EACH OTHER'S BACKS...]
[STICK TO THE PLAN,
STAY TIGHT]
[LET'S DO THIS]
Drop the phone and keep your hands where I can see them!
That was sloppy, Chu.
All, we got guard one and knocked out.

[COPY]
The yard's clear.
We got another guard on the East side stairwell.
Hands!

OK.
Knees.
How many other are there?
No hablo inglés.
Sophie, anything?
Nothing.
I thought this was supposed to be a shipping yard.

[COPY THAT]
Come on, you have to do that?
Sorry.
No hablo inglés.
You sure this is the right place?
This is the place.
Let's go.
Jackpot!
Copy.

Outside.

Copy.

Everyone else, meet at the shipping container.
Copy that.
Look to your left.
[COPY.

Hold, I got 10 to 12 hostiles coming in hot from inside the warehouse.
Take cover!
Take cover!
Take cover!
Cover me!
- You OK?

- I got you covered.

- Argh!
Gotta get her out!
Stay down.

Are you hit?
Just got the vest.
Cover!
Go, go, go!
Now you're both being sloppy.
You owe me a beer.
Arg!

A little help here!
My arm!
- My arm!

My arm!
Whoa!

What the fuck?
It's a fucking suicide vest.
What are you wearing this shit for?
Go fuck yourself.
Inside's secured.
What the fuck...?
[WE NEED AN AMBULANCE!

[I'M ON IT!

Fuck, Phil!
No!
They got Phoenix.

I got you.
"There's not gonna be a storm".
Cover!
Cut him down.
[NO, I DON'T KNOW WHY SOME CRAZY MOTHERFUCKER]
[WOULD PUT ON A SUICIDE VEST]
[THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM ANYMORE]
[ALL RIGHT, FINE]
- Let go of me!

He won't shut up, and the guy we cut down's not talking.
¿What did Dwyer say?
He's sending a wagon.
What?
Why?
She wants us to bring him in.
- I thought this was DEA.

And she can't get a hold of brass.
Fucking Fourth!
Until she does, we're hanging on to him.
We should keep him.

Fuck them all.

They should divert to us.
We're bringing him in.
What a mess.
Most people are under the impression that since the Southern States were in favor of slavery, that they were the ones who insisted on the Three-Fifths Compromise, found in the Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution,
that determined that slaves were only worth three fifths a person.
It was, in fact, the North that did this.
The South would've loved to have counted each slave twice.
and the North, rightly so... didn't believe that the slaves that didn't have the right to vote, should count equal to those that did.
That would have given the South more power.
to put their influence on the North.
And what's your point?
I thought we were chatting.
Yes?
[YOU'VE COME AN AWFUL LONG WAY FOR NOTHING]
It's not that far.

[JUST LISTEN]
[DIEGO FUCKED UP]
[HE LOST SCORPION]
And you have him?
[NOT THAT SIMPLE]
[BUT I KNOW WHERE HE IS AND HOW TO GET HIM] [50 MILLION]
[WE BOTH KNOW HE'S WORTH TEN TIMES THAT]
I don't think this is a game you wanna play.
- You don't who you're dealing...

With.
Two hundred years ago it was so much easier to buy a human being.
Check out the story.
If it's true?
It's the fucking Scorpion.
I don't wanna lose him.
Not now.

York!
We're short-handed today.

Copy, commander.
My arm, you fucking broke it!
Yeah, I'll break the other one, move it!
Move!
I thought I made myself clear this morning.
We got jumped, and not by some...
See, you that and all I hear is that you weren't prepared.
So, what happened, Travis?

What was the DEA on to?
- What do you mean?

Clearly, they weren't honest with us.
All we know is what they told us.
They were acting on as tip that 500 million in SPL product was being moved through Monfell.
Ah, and what's it turned out to be?

A guy in a box!
Protected by heavily, fucking, armed Sao Paulo Locos soldiers...
Their tip was wrong!

That doesn't make them fucking liars.
So, what...

I have calls in.

Until we get answers, we sit tight.
- Yeah, fuck that.

You're gonna leave 'em be.
- They're the Feds' problem.

Phil is dead.
Don't you wanna know why?
Right now all I'm thinking about... is what I'm gonna tell his family.
[ELEVATOR TO THE LOBBY]
[FINE]
[LOBBY, PLEASE!

[WATCH THOSE SUDDEN STOPS, BOY!

[SOMEBODY COULD GET HURT, HA, HA!

[IT'S A BIG PLACE]
[THEY HAVE THEIR CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS UP ALREADY]
[OH, MY GOD]
Nicholas.
Mr. C, I wasn't... erm...
Make yourselves at home.
Welcome.
[COULD TAKE A NASTY FALL FROM A LOOSE BOARD]
Oh, I'll just...
[AWESOME!

Nicholas, did you do what I asked?
Yes, yes, yes!
I did.

So, I was able to tap into the security camera across from the shipping center...
Where did they take him?
S.W.A.T.'s got him back at their place.
It's their renovated training facility way out in the middle of nowhere.
Sounds like the paint isn't even dry yet.
How do you know?
I heard it on my police scanner.
Well done, Nicholas.
Now...
Can you trace the number that called this phone?
Find out who and where they are?
I can try.
Try hard.
Of course, no problem.
Melissa, Phil pulled Phoenix out of harm's way just before he got shot.
He was a hero.
Yes.
You have my word.
Whoever's responsible for this, is gonna pay.
[SORRY, I CAN'T LEAVE NOW]
No, I understand.
Should I cancel today?
No, don't do that.
[

Travis?
Yeah?
I'm really sorry.
I love you.
It's our turn in the neighborhood to host the barbecue, so...
Carley's at home making the food for 22 kids and their parents.
What's up?
Elson called.

Carley is still mad at you?
She's not mad at me.
Sorry, man, I'm on her side.
What?

Besides, you can't be on her side.

It's a brotherhood.
Yeah, but Carley is like my sister.
- And sisters overturn brotherhood, so...

Look...
You decided before you got married that you only wanted one kid, right?
Yeah, that was like ten years ago.
But then, out of the blue, you say that you want another kid.
Yeah, I said maybe we could think about having another kid.
And then, it became this whole thing...
You wanna know what she heard?
You wanna have another baby.
A baby that she's gonna have to carry for nine months, and that she's gonna have to walk away from work again, after everything she's accomplished.
She's gonna be the one to wake up ten times a night to feed and change the kid, because you're always off doing this.
- She heard all that with "maybe"?

I don't know.
What?

I don't know, it's like some sort of remote access bug.
Have you ever seen that?
Yeah, I tried that, I tried that...
Are you kidding me?
Yes, I had that in the queue!
While we're young.
I gotta go.
Please, don't touch that.
- What d'you got?

Our friend Diego is a bad, bad dude.
From Honduras, OK?
Joined the Sao Paulo Locos, more commonly known as the SPL when he was six.
He's now a frigging lieutenant.
OK, what about our mystery man?
Scorpion?
Is that what we're calling him?
Yeah, for now, erm...
Nought on him.

What about other databases?
- Such as...?

I don't have clearance to tap those.
Yeah but, you would probably do it without clearance, right?
Are you asking me or telling me?
There's no way a guy protected by SPL's best, is a ghost.
Just find out who he is.
You got it, boss.
Hey, put Diego in room one.
- Get him to talk.

I'm gonna go talk to this Scorpion.
Dwyer's gonna lose her shit.
Let me worry about Dwyer.
No comprendo.

Hey, Diego, we meet again.
You broke my fucking arm.
I gave you the choice to have your arm broken or not.
You chose poorly.
Now, explain something to me.
Why would a lieutenant be put on babysitting duty?
Did they demote you, Diego?
Go fuck yourself, puta.
Who's the man in the box?
You wanna know who he is?
Es el Diablo.
That's who he is.

Do you want something to drink?
You need a medic.

Am I being charged with a crime?
That depends.
- On?

Have you asked Diego who I am?
No comprendo Como puede predecir el futuro.

What's that?
He said this was gonna happen.
- Who said what...?

Who would escape?

You are fucking dead and you don't know it.
You tell them I did this, OK?
You tell them I did it.
Hey, stop!
Diego, stop!

I need some help in here!
Perhaps you should attend to that.
Stop it!
God!
What the fuck happened?
He just impaled himself.
You're kidding me!
Fuck me!
Who the fuck are you?
You have blood on your hands.
Answer the question.
Did you kill him?
No.
He killed himself.
Cracked his skull wide open.
We do not have much time.
I'm not asking again.
What is important is that you listen.
You may think the events of today were an error.
But I assure you, my friend, they were not.
You'd better start answering my questions.
I have information in my head worth billions of dollars.
What kind of information?
The kind that can set the world on fire.
Jesus Christ!

Fine, here is the truth.
Very soon you will be told that officers from a Federal Agency are here to take me into custody.
They are not what they say they are.
Do not let these men take me.
Do this and I will help you to survive what is coming next.
- FBI is here for him now.

I told you I had calls in.
We're handing him over so, we can all go home.
- Did they say who he was?

Someone they've been after for a while.
- Where are they?

I'll take care of it.
I'll get them, bring them to him, pass him off.
Gentlemen, you're here for the prisoner.
Commander Hall, I'm agent Franklin.

- Sorry for the delay.

- We appreciate you hanging on to our guy.

Right this way.
It's funny, I thought all FBI guys used Berettas.
These are our personal weapons.
On the job?
It's a holiday.
So, what'd this guy do to get on your database, anyway?
- Terrorist stuff.

"Terrorist stuff".

Come on!

Well, look, it's clear you guys aren't FBI so, no fooling.
Who are you?
Just hand the prisoner over.
Not until I get some answers.
You are dead, motherfucker.
- Drop the knife, now!

Hands on your head.
Knees!
Your all right, Commander?
Prick.
You got him?
Yeah, we got him.
Commander?
Commander!
You trust me now?
Cuffs!
Hands on your head.
Let's go!
You're all right, Commander?
Yeah, yeah.
Keep moving!
Keys, cowboy.
I'm going to enjoy watching you die.
Shut the fuck up!
Everything happened the way he said it would.
Our mystery man is not even in the FBI's database.
Wait, how do you know that?
You hacked the FBI database?
Just a bit.
Look, on the way to the shipping center,
I made a crack at agent Weir about this being the calm before the storm.
And he said there wasn't gonna be a storm.
I don't think these guys were expecting any resistance, which is odd, don't you think?
It doesn't matter what I think.

Oh, fuck protocol, Ellen!
This isn't the end of it.
We lost enough of our guys today.

Now, you're a cop, right?

What does your blood tell you?
Let's see what he has to say.
D'you know this man?
He actually just tried to kill me to get to you.
I've never seen him before, but I know more like him will be coming.
Many more.
Why won't you tell us your name?
That is for your protection.
- The least you know...

The ink on your back is definitely not Sao Paulo Locos, nor does it rep any other rivals so you're clearly not a part of that game.
My guess is you're Special Ops.
You've been tortured, and from the looks of it, more than once.
You could've easily escaped the compound but you chose not to.
Why?
You need our protection.
'Cos everyone and their mother is coming after you.
Because what you know... could cause blow back.
It is far more complicated than that.
Fill me in here.

Because I believe you when you say that more like that guy are coming.
But you're gonna have to square up with me.
If you want us to do more than just turn you over.
You were correct about the Special Ops.
But that was only in the beginning.
I quickly realized that information was true power.
- So you're a spy.

Hmmm.
What is it?
-I traced the cellphone.

I don't have a "Who" but...
I have where the call originated from.
OK so, what happened?

I... made a mistake in Bogotá.
Here's the why they kept you.

To facilitate my sell.
Bullshit!
The SPL knows their way.

No, but others do.
- Who then?

But one thing I am sure of...
Someone from your team is involved.
Nicholas, who are these people?
Show me who we're up against.
Where are you going, Travis?
Commander?
I'm moving him.
Where?
You're not going alone.

No!
Just me.
What, are you crazy?
- That doesn't make any sense!

If I tell you where I'm going...
They could get it out of you.
They wouldn't be able to.
They're coming for him, Soph...
And they're not gonna stop.
I'm not gonna let another person I care about die today.
They know he's here, they could be watching the compound and...
I'll have Elson review the area.
Thanks.
Moving you.
Moving me will not keep them from coming for me.
No, but it'll keep them from my team.
And that's my priority.
So it's gotta be.
Look, Commander, what's going on?
Hey!

What do you mean "out"?
It's him.
- Hello?

[YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME]
How are we looking?
Yeah, yeah, everything looks good.

"Remote access error".

That?
I don't know.

[I'M IN POSITION]
Did you disable the camera that shows our sniper?
Actually, what I did was record a bunch of footage before he got there and just have it playing back on a continuous loop.
A simple "Yes" would suffice.
- Is it clear?

Yes.
- Do you think they're watching?

Travis, stop!
What are you doing?
You said you didn't anyone else to die.
Yeah, and that includes you.
I'll radio when I'm safe.
Let's go.
I was personally put in charge of Glen Damone's protection.
D'you know who that is?
The Mafia accountant.
The trial lasted five months.

Never got one scratch under my watch.
Wait.

That was on Witness Protection.

Watch your head.
So, wait til they clear out the compound and then, take out the driver.
Anyone kill Scorpion, they go next.
[ROGER THAT]
They're leaving the facility.
Take him out.
- It'd be wise to take cover.

Duck!
Oh, shit!
They're under attack!
- We gotta go!

- Dwyer, where are you going?

You're not field, help from here!
And find out where the back-up is!
[

We are under heavy attack and need immediate assistance.
[ROGER THAT, SEATTLE S.W.A.T.]
Hang tight.
Back-up is on its way.
Commander?
Go, go, go!
I got the shot!
Not on my shift, motherfucker!
Fuck!
Do not let him get away!
Commander!

Son of a bitch.
Back to the compound.

Holy fuck.
Left, left, left!
- Clear!

Get the truck out!
Everyone!

- Gutiérrez!

Go, go!
Dwyer, shut us down!
- I'm on it!

What part of "We need him alive" do they not understand?
Are those shields?
Well, you have to admire their resilience.
Nicholas...
Can you open them?
It's one thing to hack into their comms and cameras, but the shields are controlled by the internal mainframe.
They need to be taken out before I can do anything.
Find a way past those shields.
Leave the rest to me.

Kill everything.
Put in the next wave, and let's see how resilient they truly are.
You got that?
Where's the back-up, Elson?
What the fuck happened?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold on, hold on...

I assure you, Inspector, what is out there is far more dangerous to you than me.
They're only dangerous to us because of you.
You brought this to our door, all of it, and I can end it right now.
And you think killing me, will stop this war?
Ellen, this isn't who we are.
- Now, what?

Yeah, they cut the comm and the power and judging by the signal display on my cell...
- They're jamming the cell tower too.

Any satellite phones on site?
Yeah, none that are working.
Why is the security cameras working but not the internet or phones?
Well, Ellen, in cases like this, you always wanna see, so we put security on a separate circuit on internal mainframe.
And they will want to see as well.
They hacked the security cameras.
- They can do that?

For somebody that's good enough, it's not.
Elson, cut the interior security cameras.
- Don't let them Se what we're doing here.

You must get this to your skulls.
These are professional soldiers, they will isolate you, intimidate you, until they find your weakest link and then exploit it.
I thought you said the phones were out.
They are.
Hello?
Commander Hall?
Yeah.
I'm the man in control of the small army sitting on your doorstep.
D'you have a moment to chat?
If you want to put me on the speaker, go ahead, I understand.
Everyone should hear.
I should have done this earlier.
It would've saved us a whole lot of time and sweat.
And blood.
I have your compound surrounded, your power, your network, all your communications are down.
No one knows that you're in trouble and no one's coming to help.
Your officer spoke to my associate, Simone.
not a dispatch operator.
Hello!
The man you pulled out of a box belongs to me.
Hand him over... and I'll go away.
Just like that?
Just like that.
Can't do it.
Scorpion!
I know you're listening.
Tell this people who I am.
His name is Lars Cohagen.
He runs a private military cooperation that specializes in dark ops.
You mean like the kind that overthrows small countries?
Some are not so small.
Now they're all in the know, why don't you come on out and spare the lives of these nice people?
Let them return to their homes and enjoy what's left of their holiday?
They can still catch the fireworks.
How many times are we going to go through this?
This is it.
This is our last dance.
I've heard this before.
Commander Hall, the man you're protecting is a consummate liar.
His skills of deception supersede even mine.
In fact, I would guarantee that he's lying to you right now.
Has he told you that there's one in your Organization against you?
Or that he has information that could set the world ablaze?
He is a liar, and a killer, and nothing more!
All your problems go away if you just...
Turn him over.
I already told you.
I'm not doing that.
Commander...
So, this stranger's life is more important to you than your team's?
What about Daniel Chu?
David Jefferson?
Louis and María Gutiérrez?
Carley and Rebecca?
Scorpion's life worth more to you than their lives?
Are all their lives worth Scorpion's to you?
Enough!
I'm coming out.
But before I do...
I want your guarantee.
No harm comes to anyone here, nor their families.
You have my word.
I will be out in ten minutes.
You'd better be.
Commander, try the phone again.

No.
Shit.
- You're not giving yourself up.

I only said I was coming out.
- You think you can take out his whole army alone?

With the shields down, this place can withstand a full scale riot.
You don't have to go.
Hold on a second.

- Are you giving yourself up or not?

- We can't allow...

Did you not see that army out there?
We just lost Phil and Benson.
And I'm not planning to join them today because of this son of a bitch.
You heard him, Commander.
He's threatening our families and there's no way to call for back-up.
This guy is a fucking liar.

No, we're not giving in to this Lars Asshole.
Not after all that's happened!
Look, it ain't his fault that some lunatic is shooting off the building.
Maybe it is.

Scorpion could've escaped or killed us several times over.
He didn't.

That just might mean that he needed our help to survive.
That doesn't disprove anything that Lars said.
Believe Lars when he says that he will stop at nothing to find a way inside to get me.
If I do not come out now, that army outside,
Those phoney agents...
They are just the tip of the iceberg.
You're right.
We'll put you by the back door.
Only it won't be you.
In theory it should work.

I wanna thank you for your assistance today, Nicholas.
My pleasure, Sir.
Did you know that Scorpion and I used to be partners?
Right, you were saying.
It was great for a while.
And then, five years ago in Berlin, he betrayed me.
After all we'd been through.
You know, and I knew it...
I knew something was wrong but I didn't react in time.
And since then, I'm taking greater precaution with my business dealings, because...
No matter how much you think you know someone,
They can stab you in the back.
D'you understand what I'm saying?
Erm...
Yeah, I think so.
Good.
All right, let me get this straight.
You wanna raise the door shields and let the army in.

Not let them in.

Why won't that work?
Because it's bad shit crazy.
Well, there's no way we're turning this man over to mercenaries.
Once there in the courtyard, we've got them trapped.
How do you figure that?
The back door is located in the deepest part of the courtyard.
Here.
Now, about three dozen office windows look down on to it.
That's where we'll be.
We'll make them think we're handing you over.
To sell it, Elson will figure out a way to open the rear entrance shield.
Now, once they get eyes on the bait, they're gonna move in underneath our hidden positions.
And that's when we hit them.
They'll be sitting ducks.
This is the first time the shields have ever been activated.
I've never done... nor am I even sure that isolated openings would work as you described them!
Yeah, well, you'll figure it out.
They'll be expecting something like that.
Yeah, well, this is our only option.
They got us boxed in.
We can't call out.

It's only a matter of time til he finds his way inside.
At least, this way it's on our own terms.
Look, guys, this isn't an order.
I'm not forcing you into this.
But I, for one, don't wanna sit around and let someone else determine my fate.
If I'm going out... it's gonna be on my terms, not theirs.
If this is what you want, I will need fire power.
We got every weapon known to man.
What exactly are you looking for?
I will know it when I see it.
We aim to please.
In the meantime, spread out and load up.
Just cos I'm browsing, don't mean that I'm giving up on you, baby.
What the fuck do you do with that?
You don't want anything to do with that.
That's when you got nothing left to live for.
Huh.
Hey!
Oh!

What did you find?
Excellent.
Why?
Our regular radios don't work.
He may have already tapped into those frequencies, he will not be able to do so with this model.
OK.

You gotta change.
How did you get the name "Scorpion" anyway?
I assume that's not on your birth certificate.
You are assuming I have a birth certificate.
All right, you're not gonna tell me your name.
At least you can tell me how you know Lars Cohagen.
We were once partners.
I never said I was a good man, Commander, just good at what I do.
You do not know me, Commander.
You should not be taking this risk.
Even holiday double-time ain't enough to deal with this shit today.
You know the job, is risk.
There's nothing about it for you.
Not any longer.
Our guys' blood were spilled today.
Someone's gonna pay for that.
There is one thing you have not addressed.
The person on the inside who is working against us.
When they attacked the van, they were waiting for us.
Someone told Lars you were taking me from the compound.
[TWO MINUTE WARNING]
Copy that.

We go on my call.
Copy that.
Good luck.
Never really believed in luck.
Well, good luck anyway.
Everyone set?

- Yes, Sir.

Yes, Sir.
Soph, you remember Suffolk, a few years back?
Yeah.
It's another supposedly cake-walk mission, it turned into a shit show.
Was it 40 gang-bangers against eight S.W.A.T?
I tell people I'll never know how we survived that night.
But I do know.
We're S.W.A.T.
We're the baddest motherfuckers on Earth.
Let's get in position.
Take care of yourself.
You know, the least he could have done was giving us the microchip, in case we needed to barter it for our lives.
There's no microchip.

Hey, make sure we're in position before you...
Hey!
It's not my first rodeo.
Don't fuck up.
How are we looking?
When we get to go, all I gotta do is hit "ENTER", and it'll raise the shield by the rear entrance.
- But not the rest of the building?

In theory.
In theory?
In theory.
Position.

Go, go, go, go!
No sign of Scorpion.
Commander, is your team ready?
Let's go around the horn.
Hooks, set.
Jefferson, set.
York, set.
Gutiérrez, set.
Chu, set.
Ward, are you in position?
Ward?
Sorry, I was using the wrong mike.
All set.
Raise the shield.
Copy!
It worked!
Right on time.
They're opening the shield by the rear entrance.
Move in!
[HERE THEY COME, GET READY]
Third floor window.
What is that?
Morse Code.
- Pull everyone back.

[EVERYONE, MOVE BACK, NOW]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, he's stopping.

Hey!
What the fuck just happened?
Everybody, fall back to the command center.
[COPY.

Fuck!
- Elson, shut down the rear shield.

- Where's everybody else?

Scorpion's MIA.
Dwyer left a few minutes ago.
Where?
We saw this flashlight at the third floor window and she just bolted.
Flashlight?

Right there.
Stay here and keep an eye on everything outside.
- Where are you going?

Scorpion, come in!
Scorpion, do you copy?
Get up.
I'm gonna let you out of here.
You're gonna tell Lars I'm gonna find another way to give him Scorpion.
No one else needs to die.
Shit, it was you.
Yeah, I'll tell him.

The amount is the same upon delivery.

50 million is a big fucking payday for a cop.
Those DEA assholes are always giving us the toppings.
- About time I got some.

This fucking mess is Hall's fault.

What the hell is the plan on getting me out of here?
We're gonna cut the auxiliary power to the internal mainframe.
Once the shields are up, Lars can take care of the rest.
- Where are the controls locker?

Thanks.
Ward?
Fuck!
Ellen!
- You're all right?

It was Ward.
I saw him talking with Franklin before Franklin killed him.
Where did he go?
In there.
- Yeah?

What's that?
What'd just happened?
The fucking security feed's been cut.

I thought you said the feed was internal.
It is!
Without it, I've lost control of our security system.
And what does that mean?
What I mean is the same crazy fuck that's been attacking us all day, can pop open our shields, and there is nothing that we can do about it!
Close in.
Clear.
- What the fuck is happening?

- Can you stop it?

Shit.
What are you gonna fucking do, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Agh!
Travis!
Intel from Berlin.
Dead or alive no longer matters.
I will go in there and fucking kill him myself if I have to!
Go!
Everyone, move in!
[SHOOT TO KILL SCORPION ON SIGHT]
Go, go!
Oh, shit!
- Everyone, fall back.

Go, go, go!
Elson, come on!
After those guys!

Clear!
Move, move, move, move!
Let's go, let's go!
[MAN DOWN!

Jefferson, come on!
Jefferson!
Go!
Later, bitches!
Get over yourself.
Go, go!
Duck!
Oh...
You meant that kind of fire power.
I have something to show you.
The way out.
I found a maintenance tunnel.
Yeah, it's been sealed.
Not anymore.
Nope.

Hey, it's either that... or you go back there to face a bunch of bad-ass who's shooting at you.
All right.

OK.
Fuck!
- Right after you, Elson.

Travis.
I'm going after Dwyer.
No way I'm leaving one of our own behind.
Get them to safety, OK?
You don't know how many of those fuckers are still crawling around up there.
- Or if she's even alive.

- Go on.

He won't be.
I'll call for back-up as soon as I can.
- You don't have to do this.

You didn't have to come back just for us.
I didn't.
Looks like everybody cleared out.
Unlikely.
Lars would never give up.

At least, I got you.
Now, let us see if you can finish the job.
Hey.
Hey.
- What happened?

The good guys won.

We lost York and Jefferson.
- Oh, God, no.

- What about Scorpion?

Somehow...
- Still no signal?

Gutiérrez said she'd call it in when they got out.
The cell towers must still be jammed.
But it shouldn't be too long now.
Which means you need to disappear.
I don't know if I have it in me to run anymore.
I'm constantly running.
That and all the people trying to kill me...
It's exhausting.
You got all that money in your head.

It is blood money.
As a matter of fact...
Dude, what the fuck?
Take it.
What the hell is it?
It's what all the fuss is about.
A microchip.
It was in your head...

And now, it's better in your hands.
[LATE LAST NIGHT, A SHIPPING CONTAINER ARRIVED AT MONFELL FROM BOGOTÁ]
[AND WHAT'S IT TURNED OUT TO BE?

[YOU KNOW, THE LEAST HE COULD HAVE DONE WAS GIVING US THE MICROCHIP,]
[IN CASE WE NEEDED TO BARTER IT FOR OUR LIVES]
[THERE'S NO MICROCHIP]
Ellen, what are you doing?
It's nothing personal, Travis.
You should have just handed Scorpion over, Travis.
No one was supposed to get hurt.
You should have just let it go.
Don't!
Don't.
It's over.
[WHAT DID I SAY?

- You're good?

FBI was on to her.
And she knew.
I never liked her.
What is that?
A souvenir.
Excuse me, Commander.
Can I ask you to come and identify the body?
Is this the man known as "Scorpion"?
- That's...

OK.

Is there something you wanna tell me?
Yeah, but for your protection, I'd better not.
The less you know...
[HEY, HON...]
[HOW'S THE PARTY GOING?

[TRAVIS, OH, MY GOD]
[I'VE BEEN WORRIED SICK, ARE YOU OK?

[YEAH, I'M FINE, I'M ON MY WAY]
[I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT WHEN I GET HOME, OK?

- Purple.

- Three.

- Four.

Hi, Daddy.
Hi, sweetheart.
You look like you could use a beer.
Or 20.
- Hey.

What's this?
Yeah.
This is enough.
For me.
Just you... and her...
I don't need anything more.
But I'm pregnant.
Are you kidding me?
Surprise!
- Is that what you were trying to tell me?

Did you know about this?
Yeah, I could tell.
You two!
[HALL HERE...]
[COMMANDER, WE GOT A REAL SHIT SHOW IN PROGRESS]
[AT CAPITOL BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN OLYMPIA]
[WE NEED YOU AND YOUR TEAM ON SCENE ASAP]
