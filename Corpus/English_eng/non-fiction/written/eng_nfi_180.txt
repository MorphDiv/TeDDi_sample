Okay, I'm zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel.
Nicely done, Howard.
Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly I know my way around tiny things.
Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child.
Those are just the things I say out loud.
Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately.
What's wrong?
I'm looking at the math, and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller.
That's great, but the Air Force approved the specs.
We're good to go.
Shame on you.
Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude?
I'll tell you.
We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup.
Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but that's just poodle politics.
Can we please stop talking about poodles?
Sheldon, we don't need to make this smaller.
I don't want to go home.
Fine, go for a little walk.
Then what?
Just keep walking.

At least it's quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.
I know.
That's why I keep refilling his water when he's not looking.
You're kidding.
I don't care if we're in a drought, it's worth it.
You know, I-I do have a way to get him out of our hair.
I've been holding onto this for a few years, but maybe now's the time.
You can't kill him; he'll just respawn at the last save point.
Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom.
As long as that's not a urinary tract infection, that's a personal best.
Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present.
Really?
"Congratulations.
"The bearer of this certificate is entitled
"to the ultimate train experience
"at The Nevada Northern Railway.
"You are at the throttle.
"You are the engineer.
You are running the locomotive."
This doesn't happen very often, but here comes a hug.
For Howie's occupation, should I include that he was an astronaut?
Well, he mentioned it in his mother's eulogy, so why not?
I can't believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.
Uh, the one at Caltech has a crazy wait list.
I also skipped a birthing class to see Zootopia, so back off.
Is there anything we can do?
Wash it or burn in, your choice.
(Halley crying over monitor) Ugh, be right back.
Oh, thank you.
While I'm gone, you can think about how mean you were to me.
All right, you know what you need?
A night away from all of this.
You know, where you can just kind of relax and... (Halley continues crying over monitor)
I'm just gonna... turn this off.
(Halley continues crying nearby)
Much better. (clears throat)
Seriously, let's plan a night, you know, give you a break.
We could go dancing.
All this week, the Early Music Society of Pasadena is doing a joint concert with the San Gabriel Renaissance Choir.
Okay, that's the one to beat.
Good luck.
People have been saying that for 600 years.
Hey, you're home early.
You'll never believe it.
Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive.
What'd you do?
No idea.
All I know is I'm gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.
Well, I'm really happy for you.
The railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me.
I give up.
You!
Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose.
Now, the problem with a caboose is there's no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is it's not a caboose.
On the first day,
I get to drive a steam engine.
Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine.
Oh, and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, they'll let me stay as long as I want.
So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives.
Can I pee now?
Oh, get this!
I get to take a test based on a 125-page manual.
There's forward, uh, reverse, set the brakes.
Are you done yet?
You're missing some great stuff out here.
Oh, this is good.
There are dozens of railroad crossings you have to blow the whistle for.
But that is the figurative you, not the literal you.
I'll be blowing the whistle.
(groans)
This train thing worked out better than I thought.
He's home studying the engineer's manual.
(sighs)
It's so peaceful without him here.
Can I ask you how much that cost?
$4,000-- worth every penny.
(knock on door)
Gentlemen.
Just wanted to see how the guidance system's coming along.
As a cooling solution, it's pretty cool.
(chuckles)
Don't do that.
What's this?
This is a different approach.
Are you trying to get the guidance system even smaller?
It's just a theory.
Uh, it's not even worked out.
Oh. (chuckles)
I want this.
But we've already met the agreed upon specs.
Going smaller would require weeks' worth of new computations.
So get the kid with the two shirts to do it.
Sir, uh, i-if I may, uh, we've put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype.
It's a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works.
Yeah, I want this.
But that's just a theory.
It's not even a complete thought.
You both make excellent points.
And thank you for presenting it so articulately.
(chuckles) Make this.
(door closes)
The kid with the two shirts screwed us again.
Well, the bra under here ain't beige.
You ladies have fun tonight.
Under the careful supervision of her godfather.
Like I said, you ladies have fun.
Let's party.
You know, if you pump at the bar,
I promise we'll get free drinks.
Call if there's any problems.
Got it.
I would never call Howard.
Okay, instead of arguing all night, let's just split up the baby chores.
I can't believe we have to ask Sheldon to come back and help us.
Oh, boo-hoo.
I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon.
(electrical crackling)
What is that?
I don't know, but if he yells,
"It's alive," we run.
Oh, hey.
If you knocked, I couldn't hear you.
I'm welding this locomotive engine.
And if you didn't knock, how about some manners?
How'd you even get that up the stairs?
I said to myself, "I think I can, I think I can."
And then I couldn't, so...
I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later.
Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we can't do it without you.
Interesting.
Well, so I was right.
Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine,
I don't think I can go back to theory.
I'm an engineer now.
And, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer.
Not that goofy kind you are.
Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks.
Just help us out.
(laughs)
He's worried about looking foolish.
That's a heapin' helping of irony right there.
Come on, you know you're not leaving physics.
Why are you doing this?
But when I was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked.
Then it clacked.
Then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are.
Did you hear anything back from the Caltech preschool?
Not yet, but we're gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open.
Tonight is about having fun.
Nothing says fun like being scolded.
(ringtone playing)
It's Raj.
Everything okay?
I don't need your help deciding when we need help!
Raj, what's going on?
Yes, so,
I was just warming up some milk for Halley, and I-I thought it smelled a little funky, so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says "Flerbsday."
It says "Tuesday."
I'm sure it's fine, but if you're worried, there's extra milk in the freezer.
Okay, yes,
I will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch.
You're wasting perfectly good milk.
Stuart, don't you drink my milk!
Okay, give--
Can you guys handle this or not?
(chuckles)
She said I was in charge.
Hmm.
So we just throw this away?
What else are you gonna do with it?
Put it in your coffee?
Well, I don't take it black.
I'm sure we can figure the rest out.
Hmm.
Feel free to jump in.
"Hmm" is all I got.
Oh, we can get this.
Is there any chance it's upside-down?
Maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.
Hey, I came up with that and "hmm."
You haven't pitched anything.
Just keep thinking.
I got it.
You really figured it out?
No, but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon, it will make him crazy, and he'll have to fix it.
Oh, you're a genius.
Yeah, I know.
That's not even a math symbol.
That's just Charlie Brown's hair.
Sorry, guys.
This club was so great.
How could they turn it into a bookstore?
I thought we got rid of all those.
Renaissance Choir's looking pretty good right now, huh?
(ringtone playing)
Hello?
(Halley crying) Nothing to worry about.
She's just been crying for a little while, and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep.
She was sleeping just fine till you took a selfie with her!
Oh, okay, false alarm.
Little parenting tip:
sleeping babies hate flash photography.
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
I may have just left my infant daughter with Patrick and SpongeBob.
Hey, there's another dance club nearby.
I mean, I don't know how you feel about Latin music, but according to their horas of operación, they're open.
Maybe we should just call it a night.
Yeah, we're all dressed up.
Why go home?
I'm just not really in the mood anymore.
What's going on with you?
I'm not sad.
I just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants.
I'm not sad.
I mean, hello.
Okay, maybe I'm the one who's sad.
What are you sad about?
Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby.
You're upset I had a baby?
I didn't think it would make me have all these feelings.
What feelings?
Pressure!
I mean, she's looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401(k).
Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race.
You think that stuff is fun?
Being a parent is terrifying.
I'm constantly worried, I'm always tired, and in a few minutes, I'm gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot.
I get that, okay?
It's just, Leonard and I have been married for two years, and we're no further along than when we were dating.
You've got so much to feel good about.
You've got a great job now.
Yeah, I guess I am making decent money.
You make more than I do.
You may not have a house yet, but your apartment's great.
It's bigger than mine.
And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice.
I'm not even engaged once.
I don't even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage.
I'm not getting any younger.
Honestly, I kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of...
(crying)
Oh, that's gonna make me cry.
(crying)
And there they go.
Ew.
Well, Sheldon, turns out we didn't need you after all.
Well, good for you guys.
Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and I'm okay with it.
Aren't you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?
It's a manifold.
Oh.
Well, I guess it's fixed.
Just look at the board.
That's wrong.
Oh, no!
What should we have done differently?
Well, first of all, you can't use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation.
Told ya. (scoffs)
Can you fix it for us?
(sighs)
Okay, but this is the last time.
Nice try, blockheads.
Besides, you have no idea what you're doing with this stuff.
But if you really want to learn the mechanical side,
I can teach you anything you want to know.
And with all these new skills, you'd be able to fix any model train.
You'd be the king of the train store!
I'm already king of the train store.
So, what do you say?
I'm like the crankshaft of this team.
That's a turbo.
Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy.
I'm gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home.
(train chugging, steam hissing)
(train whistle blows)
I apologize that it's so warm in here.
It is warm in here.
I've worked up a bit of a sweat.
Me, too.
May I borrow your water?

GPS says we'll be at the railway in three hours.
