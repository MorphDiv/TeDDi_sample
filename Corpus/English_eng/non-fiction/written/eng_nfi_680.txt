A maverick billionaire...
My name is gideon reeves.
I built an empire making rockets, computers, robots...
Made over $100 billion.

I'm an engineer.
Touched by tragedy...
The money!

My friend has been shot.
Where the hell are you people?

Takes on the biggest engineering challenge.
Of his career...
I want justice for elliot james sully.
Give me the 13th district to run.
A civilian can't take over a police district.
They can, with a special appointment from this committee.
To revolutionize a police force...
Technology doesn't solve cases, cops do.
You haven't met my technology.
Wow...
And save a city.
You guys are my partners.
We're gonna change the world.
On behalf of reeves industries,
Welcome to the nerdgasm event of the year,
The silicon super bowl for the pasty and clever,
The windy city tech summit!
Holograms!

Who here loves a good hologram?
Yes, that's what I thought.
So, as chief sponsor of today's festivities,
That amazing-ness is what reeves is all about.
Making you see things in a new way,
Changing the world,
One awesome, mind-blowing demonstration at a time!
We love you, gideon!
Yes.

Well, that's enough of me,
At least until my keynote speech later,
Which is gonna be great, that I can tell you.
So, without further ado...
You know what?

So, there have been some reports in the press lately.
That have been less than kind to me and my company.
One described me as a "flailing ceo with cop fantasies."
I just want to say to all the haters out there,
This company is stronger than ever.
Just to prove it,
I want to bring up my chairman of the board.
She doesn't want to come up.

Could you just give her a little bit of love, please?
Yes.
She has been a wonderful,
Wonderful friend since my mit days, and a tireless supporter.
Of reeves industries...
The brilliant and beautiful...
You smart-ass son of a...

Ladies and gentlemen!

You guys are great!
Let the nerding out begin!
Yeah!
Welcome to the windy city tech summit.
Yeah, nice try, gideon.
What?

Are you not my good friend?

Are you not the chairman of my board?
The chairwoman of...

Whatever you are, you're very good at what you do.
If you think kissing my ass in public is going to make up.
For your falling revenue, you are sorely mistaken.
What?

I got distracted when you mentioned your ass.
All right, and flirting's not gonna work either.
You are bleeding money with this new little cop hobby.
Please.

We've done this dog and pony show so many times,
We could wear a leash.
And a saddle, which you would look great in, actually.
Stop.

Stop it.
This one is different.
Yeah.

Wait.

What?

Autographs, unsolicited pitches...
All right, well, you should be happy.
That they still want you to kiss their babies.
They might not love you for much longer.
What?

Gideon, trust me when I tell you,
If this convention doesn't go off without a hitch,
This very well could be our last.
This is the first time in your career where you've dug.
Yourself into a hole, and I don't know if I can dig you out.
If you don't stop checking those crime stats,
I'm gonna shove that phone so far down your throat,
There's gonna be a new crime.
For your little friends to investigate.
All right.

It's very attractive on you.
Come on.

While mr.

We're gonna be running things.
A little more rough and ready around here.
Not to worry.
We'll still have the basics,
But nobody's gonna be inventing.
Any new robots, at least not until he gets back.
So,
Eyes and ears open.

Murphy?
Need to talk to you for a minute.
You should head down to 77th and freemont.
What is it?

Twentysomething found his roommate dead.
Apparently, the victim was meeting with someone.
About an online sale.
Is that all we got?
That and his laptop.
Great.

I mean, without gideon here,
The only technical support I have is police i.T.,
And they still use fax machines.
Well, maybe you should take her.
Ada?

Unless you got a better idea.
She is the computer girl around here.

You're going out on a murder with murphy.
What?

I'm not even a cop.
I don't look like a cop, I don't act like a cop,
I especially don't dress like a cop.
Don't worry.

So what am I supposed to do?
It's gonna be fine.

I'll let you know if we need anything.
Try not to yak.
It's a first-time murder scene thing.
Yeah.
Okay.
So you discovered josh's body.
When you got home?

Total combat, was psyched to play it,
And then I found him,
You know,
Out of lives.
Okay, um, he was meeting someone from the internet?
Do you know who?
Sorry, I don't.
All right, just wait outside.
We'll finish your statement later.
Did you get anything?
No, it is password-protected, so it's gonna take a while.
You can do something, right?

I mean, I could try a brute force attack.
Or a cryptography approach.
The password's mookie22, capital "m."
That'll work.
You seem annoyingly cheerful.
Sorry.
You know, gideon's at his little conference thing,
And, you know, it just feels good.
To be back to basics, you know?
Yeah, just when you were warming up to the new toys.
Some of 'em.

No.

You know, it's always there, watching, hovering above us.
I'm always afraid it's gonna take my head off.
Man, yesterday we wrestled two drunk dudes with knives.
You seriously worried about a drone?
The robots always turn on the humans eventually.
Terminator, westworld.
It's just a matter of time.
What is it?
Possible suicide.
I hate suicide calls.

We're in a beat car.
And besides, you can't stand it.
When other cops try to put their crap on us.
I'm just saying that suicide calls are the worst.
It's just...

Call came from a 19-year-old student at rockwell.

Address is a dorm.
We're not punting this.
I haven't seen evan since yesterday.
What's going on?
We just need to check his room.
Yeah.
Evan finley, chicago police.
You in there?
Open up!
Open it.
Okay.
Good.

We dodged a bullet.

You don't know that.
Well, hopefully,
He changed his mind and went and got some pizza.
Speaking of, um, let's go get some lunch or something.
We're not done here.
How much longer is this gonna take?
Maybe a bit because.
There's not an icon I can click on.
That just says "murder motive."
I don't know how you spend your life glued to a computer screen.
I mean, I'd go crazy.
Yeah, well, beats staring at a severed trachea.
I got something.
What?
Looks like an e-mail exchange.
Between the victim and the guy he was selling to.
What were they selling?
Trying to figure that out.
Looks like...

They set up a meeting place yesterday.
Blah, blah.
No.
Ada, what?
They were selling.
An all-access wristband to gideon's convention.
Nice meeting you.
We here at milliscan are excited to announce.
That we've made millimeter wave scanning 70% smaller.
Our small, easy-to-use millimeter wave scanners...
I'm here to win.
And you liked it?
I loved it.
Yeah, you got really into it?
I'm bored.
Shut up.
I'm looking at boring people with gray boxes.
With milliscan...
Do you know what their market cap is, their valuation?
I can't hear you.

No more being herded like cattle.
No need to arrive two hours prior to your flight.
There is a lot of money in airports.
There is a lot of foot odor at security checks.
Gideon.
What?

You know what they say.
Once you pass the mesosphere, you never...
All right, bottom line is,
These guys want a partnership with reeves.
They're practically throwing cash at us.
And with your balance sheet looking the way it does,
You better dance like a stripper for that cash.
What are ada.
And murphy doing here?

No, gideon, not today.
I'm sorry.

We've got reeves industries' business to take care of.
I...

We're in chicago.

Who the hell is she?
Murphy, lauren.

Gideon's busy.
You're gonna have to solve your own problems.
We need to talk to gideon now.

What's important.
Is your boss' undivided attention right here.
Do you see my badge?

The company paid for that badge, and the company's on the line.
Lauren, you have to stop talking.
About profit margins for, like, one second, okay?
The killer stole a wristband for this event.
And to make matters worse, I tracked his ip address.
It took me to this hate forum.
Read the last comment.
"I'm gonna kill gideon reeves"?
My day was going so well.
I think we're all taking this a little too seriously.
I mean, you're not really a celebrity.
Till someone threatens to kill you.
That's not funny.
This wasn't just the one threat.
Whoever this guy is, he's obsessed.
And he's smart enough to hide his ip address from me.
You couldn't track him at all?

Best I could do was bring in the administrator of the hate board.
Murphy and...
Ada are gonna interrogate him now.
What?

You're just gonna translate.

Hey.

It's a murder investigation.
These things take a while.
Yeah, but we don't have a while.
Also, I've been looking around.
There's about $10 million in reeves tech installed,
Which I never received property requests for.
It's an investment.
It's a bottomless pit.
Can I get you a donut?
Okay,
So you're an online ticket broker?
Of sorts.
So do you know reevesreaper26?
Maybe.
Sure looks like you know him.
Well, the traffic on your forum shows.
That you facilitated a sale of a windy city tech summit.
All-access wristband.
From a joshman5 to...
A reevesreaper26.
And?

Reevesreaper26 killed joshman5 this morning.
So angrycop1 wants to know.
How your little chat room set up a murder.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
I thought we were here about some online harassment.
You heard me.
Murder.
So you have a simple choice Either get charged.
With conspiracy or you give us something that we can actually use.
Like what?

You don't track your users, tag 'em with an evercookie?
No.

Okay?

Trust me, I got no desire to meet 'em in person.
Especially not that guy.
Why?

All I know is his posts, okay?
But dude's got some serious demons.
Like psych ward-level stuff.
Talking about gideon stealing.
Ideas straight from his brain.
That's all I got, okay?
It's not good enough.

Wait.

The wristband the guy was selling,
He posted a picture to prove it was real.
I could download it for you.
Might have the code.
That's worth something, right?
Yeah.
Looks like you just found your "get out of jail free" card.
There, carter.
Sir, we need to know where your son is.
Hell if I know.
But this is exactly the kind.
Of thing his majesty the drama queen would pull.
Yeah, well, the hotline counselor he spoke with.
Said it sounded serious.
I'm sure it did.

And the two times before that.
Kid just wants attention.
When was the last time you saw evan?
Last night.

You mind telling us what happened?
I do mind.
This is family business.
This is your son.
And you can't tell us anything about...
No, and I don't have to.
I know my rights.

Damn it, maura.

Jackson barrett.

He might know where to find him.
Thank you, ma'am.
Please, just tell us he's safe.
Geez, I thought you were gonna clock that guy.
Probably 'cause I was.
We need to go back to that school.
Hey, you heard 'em.

We've coded three calls since we've been on this.
We need to get back on the street.
No, we need to find this kid.
One of those calls was an armed robbery.
You telling me that chasing this around is.
More important than that?

No.
Then the possibility of this kid killing himself.
Is a hell of a lot more important.
Okay,
So here's what we got.
According to the convention's qr log,
This particular wristband was scanned in at 12:22 p.M.
All right.

So he'll be on the security footage.

No, we don't got him.

What's up with the camera?

Our killer knows his stuff.
That's called an i.R. Mask.
Surveillance cameras don't like led lights.
You wear enough of them, then you turn into casper there.
Then you ditch the whole thing when you get inside.
And you're untraceable.
Not bad.
I just mean the tech.
The killer psychopath part is-is totally uncool.
Can't you track his wristband?
No.

Not unless he scans it again.
Gideon, there's a man inside that wants you dead.
I think it's time.
To shut the show down.

Slow down, officer.

Detective.
And I can do whatever I need to in the name of public safety.
Why don't you just find the guy?

There's almost 3,000 people in there.
I don't have.
Enough manpower to scan every single wristband.
One at a time...

Don't kill each other, please.
Everybody just dial it down.
Pretty sure I can solve this.
Can I borrow you.
For a second?
Um, have a seat right there, please.
What are you doing?
So, to read a qr code,
You need a light source,
A computer...
And a camera.
Just put your wrist right here.
And that goes...
You could be nicer to murphy.
Well, you know I've always had a problem with authority figures.
Right.

You sure you want to lose that privilege?
Look, murphy can help us.
So just lay off her, okay?
Come on.
There.

Unbelievable.
Okay!
Okay.

What if I told you we could scan the entire crowd?
What?

You have a killer that's running around.
And what do you think he's gonna do.
If we shut it down?

One by one?

We lose him.
Worst case, he goes nuts.
He's got a good point.
Your call, murphy.
What's your plan?
We're gonna use me to find this guy.
The hologram me.
Look, the venue has security cameras, right?
So all we have to do is turn the hologram lasers around.
To scan the crowd.
Then we combine the two with some qr-reading software.
Bam.

Okay, but that's never been done before.
Well, if you're trying to stroke my ego,
Then it's working.
Aren't people gonna notice.
They're being zapped by a giant laser?
Well, that's the best part...
Once I change the light wavelength,
They're not even gonna be able to see the lasers.
Murphy, please.
Just give me a chance.

I'll give you half an hour.
That seems reasonable.
Oliver, buddy, how long you been working for me?
Three years and seven months.
Ever since I read your autobiography and interviewed six times...

Right.

All I need is to reroute the surveillance footage.
Into my laptop.
So the qr reader can analyze it.
But, sir,
With all due respect, I just don't see.
How you're going to repurpose.
The hologram to...

You get out of my way, reread that chapter in my book.
About how impatient I am, and then I'm gonna do this myself.
All right.
Okay.
Look, um, I think we got off on the wrong foot.
I just want you to know that it's nothing personal.
Yeah?

Well, it's just I've been protecting gideon for years.
I mean, mostly from himself.
The biggest outside threat has been patent attorneys and...
Doctors' warnings about his caffeine intake.
And now he has a killer after him.
I really don't see how that's my fault.
But I'm not pointing the finger at you.
It's just this kind of thing never happened.
Before gideon took on this new hobby.
This has nothing to do with him working with us.
And policing is not a hobby.
Trust me,
The law enforcement division.
Will end up on the reeves industry.
Island of misfit toys, along with geoscience.
And biophysical chemistry and...
And you'll still be around?
I'm the money.
He may be a billionaire,
But it takes billions more to build his empire.
Gideon's interests will come and go,
But he needs me to pay for his dreams.
We done yet?
Almost.
Gideon, the clock is ticking,
And this looks really complicated.
Trust me, it's gonna work.
It'd better. 'Cause I'm about to pull the plug.
Don't look at me.
I'm just the genius.
Jackson barrett?
Yeah.

We're looking for evan finley.
You know where he is?
Not really.

Mind if we talk outside?
I told you,
I don't know where evan is.
His parents seem to think you might know how to find him.
Why's that?
I don't know.
His parents gave you my name?
Look, bro, your buddy evan, he may be in trouble.
He called a suicide hotline.
So if there's anything you need to tell us...
No?
All right.
Let's go.
Jackson.
We're not gonna talk to your parents.
We'll keep your name out of our report.
Just help us find evan.
I didn't want my parents to know.
About my first girlfriend either.
I'm sorry.
It's just
I'm not...
You know...
Out.
Hey, that's nobody's business but yours.
We're only concerned about evan.
I...
I haven't seen him since yesterday.
I tried calling.
I got his voice mail.

Yeah, that's what we're trying to figure out.
We have a secret uber account.
For when we go out.
Maybe he used it?
Yeah, yeah, that's great.
That's really great.

Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Let's go.
Okay, once we get eyes on this guy,
We take him down nice and easy.

It's hard to catch him in this crowd.

With a lot of uniforms.

So how is our brainiac boss gonna find one wristband.
Out of a room full of wristbands?
If he says he can do it,
That's good enough for me.
Now let's spread out and be ready.
All right, gideon,
It's now or never.

Just have to change the wavelength.
Where we at, gideon?
There.
Yes.

Gideon, what's going on up there?
A technological miracle.
I'm scanning, like, a thousand wristbands with lasers.
So cut me some slack.
Come on, come on.

Yes.

Tracking him now, murphy.
He is in the southwest hall.
Cobb, reyes.
We're on our way.
Where is he?
Hang on, let me get my bearings here.
Southwest hall.
Just past the drone booth.

I can't see what you're seeing, gideon.
You're gonna have to help me out.
Hang on one sec.
Check your phone.
Your six o'clock.
Got it.

Reyes, orange hoodie.
Chicago police!
He's going for the stairs.
Hands up in the air.
Turn around slowly.
Please don't hurt me.
I'm sorry.
What can I tell you?

You're sure she didn't do it?
I thought the whole point of this thing.
Was we find the wristband, we find the killer.
She's a 16-year-old girl, cobb.
So what?

Who would've happily slit my throat.
Okay.

With a different wristband.
The all-access wristband we're tracking...
She said she found from across the bathrooms.
If she didn't do it, why'd she run?
Because she has a stolen wristband, sherlock.
She thought that we were busting her.
For trying to score some swag.
With upgraded access.
Okay, then why'd the bad guy.
Ditch it here?
Maybe because he was in there.
What the hell did he want back here?
Okay, look, the me that cares about you really hopes.
They catch this guy.

That cares about reeves industries.
Really needs you to sign off on a few deals.
Whatever.
Just buy them all.

All right.

Hey, are there security cams?
No.
Not in that area.
It's a privacy thing.
It's a bunch of exhibitors with equipment.
They don't want photographed.
Seriously, gideon, I need you to take a look at these...
Lauren, we're hunting a killer right now!
Priorities.
No, the police are hunting a killer.
You are watching a screen.
Okay, you've never watched bones?
Guys, there should be a security guard there.
Hey, over here.
There's the guard.

He's got a pulse.
Squad, we need an ambulance.
Copy that.
Maybe the killer needed backstage access.
Or firepower.
His gun's missing.
You sure this is the place?
I don't see anything.
The uber driver dropped him off here.
Yeah, so where the hell is he?
Think I found him.
Man.
Evan?
Get away from me!
Hey, easy, buddy.
You don't want to do that.

Look, you don't know me.
But I've spent the whole day getting to know you.
Met your mom.
Your boyfriend jackson.
They both love you very much.
You meet my dad, too?
Yeah.

Well, send him a picture when I jump, okay?
He'll probably tell you it's the only thing I ever did right.
Call his dad.

Don't you think that's the last person he wants to talk to?
No, that's who he needs to talk to most.
What am I supposed to say?
Whatever it takes.
Hey, evan.
Just calm down, okay?

Mr. Finley, this is officer brandt, chicago police.
You don't want to do this.
Just tell me what's going through your mind.
Let us help you.
Let me help you.
I've been in your position before.
I am not going to argue with you, sir.
Your son is one step away from taking a swan dive.
This is not a stunt.

Come on, you don't really think.
There's any chance at all.
That he's gonna...

I served overseas.
Four years.
A lot of guys over there with me.
Didn't do so well when they got back.
I've lost many people to suicide.
I know what it looks like when they're serious.
And your son is exactly that.
You got a problem with who he loves,
You man up and you deal with it.
You hear what I'm saying to you?
Right now we got to save his life.
All right, I'll talk to him.
Hey, evan.
I'm gonna bring you the phone now, okay?
Your dad wants to talk to you.
No, I'm done talking to him!
Okay.

Okay.

All right, mr.

New plan.
You got a computer with a camera on it?
Yeah, i...
Good, I'm gonna call you right back.
Hey, pete, it's brandt.

This is pete.

Need your help.
You are totally overreacting.
You can't keep me locked in here.
You're staying here until I shut this convention down.
Over my dead body.
Don't tempt me.
Please...

We have no idea what he's planning.
He has a gun, for god's sakes.
A gun.
Yeah, it's a weapon.
It's yea long and goes bang.
Murphy...

Remember the strategic partnership with milliscan?
The boring gray boxes?

You want to talk business right now.

To talk business.
Those boring gray boxes find guns.
Wow, you're good.
It's pretty slick.
Right?

And we can scan the crowd for weapons.
Well, we're gonna have to get it up high.
Yeah.
The rafters.
He loves this part.
Believe me, I know.
So are you seriously telling me.
This can scan the whole crowd for a gun?
Yeah, it's a portable version.
Of the full body scanners at airports.
So everyone is gonna jam in to here.
For my keynote speech.
There's pretty much no chance a guy obsessed with me.
Is gonna miss that.

My gut feeling is that he wants to take you down publicly.
Probably during your speech.
Do you really want to risk your life for a few bucks?
Not just money at stake, murphy.
It's my company.

It's the 13th district, too.
I'm gonna wear a bulletproof vest.
It's still a risk.
Yeah.
A risk that you take every day.
Evan, I want you to think about your future.
For when you graduate from college.
And you-you're living your own life.
No, it'll never be my own life.
Never.
It will, I promise you it will.
You just got to stay strong, buddy.
I can't anymore.
I'm done talking.
Hey, pete,
What's the eta?
It's getting desperate over here.
I'm almost there.
Just got to warn you, this is not my finest work.
It's a little duct tapey.
What the...?
What is that?
Evan.
What do you want?
Please, god, let this work.
Evan, I just want to tell you I'm here, son.
And I'm-i'm sorry.
You said you wanted me gone.
You said that...
I said a lot of stupid things.
I just...

Why don't you just get down off there,
And we'll...

Is he loves you.
Yes.
I love you.
We both do.
That's it.

I'm trying.

Please just come home.
Come on, kid.
Nice work.
Okay, cobb, you're gonna take quadrant one.
York, wolfe, you're taking two.
Reyes, cotin, you're taking three.
I'm gonna be in four.
There's, like, a thousand people in there, all staring at gideon.
How the hell are we supposed.
To find the one guy that wants him dead?
You're just gonna have to trust the tech.
Where have we heard that before?
This guy's not gonna stay still for very long.
The moment ada spots him, we take him down.
Aah!
Damn it.
Universal screws.
Yes.
Okay, and...
Yeah.
Hey, it's working.
Well, we had to give up 12% ownership of milliscan.
To get these so quickly.
It damn well better work.
What time do the doors open?
Already did.

Bad choice of words.
Kinda.
All right.
A little bit tight.
Right?
Wait a second.

We didn't have enough time to get a new one.
I'm not taking your...

You're the one that's on the business end of the gun.
If you hear a shot, you drop, okay?
Just stay low, protect your head,
And try to get behind something.
Try not to pee myself.
I don't want you to do this.
I know you don't.
But I've been doing the math on this, murph.
According to my calculations,
There are three solid arguments for why I should.
One...

This convention is very important to reeves industries.
And now, for better or worse,
What happens to reeves happens to the 13th district.
Two... no matter how crazy this killer might be,
He's undeniably smart.
We have to catch him before he hurts other people.
So, what, it takes a genius to catch a genius?
It takes a genius to know the only shot.
We have at catching this lunatic involves the both of us,
Which brings me to my third argument...
It's probably the most valid.
I know I can go out there 'cause I have you to protect me.
Of course I have your back.
But what about that billion-dollar brain of yours?
This thing?
That's hard as a rock.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
The moment you've all been waiting for...
The host of the windy city tech summit... mr.

Yes!

Hello, gideonites!
Is that a thing?

Welcome...
Can't you get a-a wider view of the crowd?
No, it's a ten-by-ten range.

I was going to give a speech about...
How driverless cars will take over the world, yadda, yadda.
I think I'm gonna shake things up a bit.
Is that okay with you guys?
Yeah!

How we doing, ada?

But it's mostly just.
Random metal stuff in people's pockets.
Come on, ada.

If we go any faster, we might miss something.
'Cause what I really want to talk.
About is risk.
So when we first went into space, was it awesome?
Yes.

But what was it above all?
Incredibly dangerous.
Check the northwest corner closest to the exit.
She's right in the middle of...
Just do it.

The best line of sight,
And the best escape route.
Okay.

Actually, yeah, she really does.
Pioneered the hot-air balloon.
What a badass.
He decides to cross the english channel by himself.
In a bag filled with air.
Heated by an open fire;
It's the first time anyone had tried that.
Damn it, where is he?

You know what happened?
The balloon deflated mid-flight, and.
He fell to his death.
Now, I don't tell you that story to bum you out.
That guy with his hand on his pocket.
You know what?

Gun!

You were right!

He's moving towards the front!
He took that risk for all of us here in this room.
'Cause without hot air balloons,
You don't get rockets.
You don't get self-driving cars.
Any of it.
Got him!

Drop your weapon!
It's all right, everyone.

Stay calm.

It's okay.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Doing all right?
We good down there?
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it.
For the fine men and women of chicago's 13th district.
For saving my life!
That was a good call today.
Using the drone.
Yeah, well, I guess it's got its uses.
Until it becomes sentient and tries to kill us.
You want to talk about anything?
No.

I'm not really a big talker.
But, um...
You know, now that you mention it...
I guess I never knew that you...
Could go so damn long without eating.
Can we please get some food?
Yeah, man.
Let's get some food.
So, morgan was a chick, then?
Hey.
How are your ribs?
They're fine.
I was looking for an excuse to skip the gym, anyway.
Well, that's the spirit.
So I looked up the shooter.
Yeah?

I never met him, but he actually worked.
At reeves for a short time.
Sounds like a smart guy,
But hr had to let him go after he failed a psych evaluation.
Apparently, he had
"obsessive thoughts and delusions of grandeur.
In regard to mr.

He swore he could hear me whispering in his ear.
Well, at least we know.
You're not the only one obsessed with you.
You got lucky today.
I mean, five inches north...
Yeah, or 14 inches south, it would have been a disaster.
But it wasn't.
And I have you to thank for that.
I have a question.
What happened to the geoscience division at reeves?
Lauren told me about it, and a few other divisions, too.
Said you started them, lost interest and walked away.
And you're worried that I'm gonna do that here?
It's crossed my mind.
Right.
Well, you know, all my life,
I've, chased the most interesting problem,
The hardest thing to solve,
And some of 'em turn out to be too easy.
Or not worth solving in the first place.
But believe me, murphy, this...
This is the hardest one ever.
I'm not going anywhere.
No matter what lauren says.
Who is she to you?
We were classmates at mit.
I went into tech, and she went into tech finance.
My first rocket... she...
Gideon, who is she to you?
That.
That's complicated.
God.
You are on fire.
What has gotten into you?
Ooh, is it 'cause I almost died?
Maybe a little.
Did you see the press on that conference?
You know what?

It was incredible.
I mean, people finally saw your technology in action.
So, you've changed your assessment of the 13th district?
Yeah.

If anything, I think you're thinking too small.
You, of all people, should know better than that.
I am serious.
I mean, people saw you get shot in reeves body armor.
And protected by reeves police, and...
Technically, they're not my police, but...
My point is, it's something that people will pay for.
Excuse me?
We could own privatized policing.
I mean, this is not some small chicago experiment.
I mean, this could go global.
This could be a billion-dollar business.
