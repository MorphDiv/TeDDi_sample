Bones, you okay?
Can i-- can i make you something?
You bought cream soda?

Who drank it-- we don't need it anymore.
I heard back from the cemetery.

They said that they'll do their best
To clean my mother's headstone before then.
I'm sorry.

For not noticing that my father was
The only one in this house
Who ever drank cream soda?
Look, you're not alone here.
Okay, remember that.

Just tell me what you need.
It's your phone.

There's a body washed up on the beach
In newfoundland, canada.
A united states passport was found in the travel belt.
Max used to buy this soda for the kids.
He would mix it up with a little heavy cream,
And he would call it a "grandpa milkshake."
I just thought it'd be nice to have around.
The remains were brought to the jeffersonian to confirm i.D.
You want me to drive you?

I'm perfectly capable of driving myself.
Remodeling of the right clavicle and ulna
Are a match for the childhood injuries, so i.D. Is positive.
"sarah abbott, 22.
Winston-salem, north carolina."
Wonder what she was doing in newfoundland.
Well, she was dressed like she was out for a hike.
There's a chest wound.
It's a through and through.
Gunshot?
There's structural damage and staining throughout.
Looks like this is what killed her.
Check it out.

Not even the ocean can make wash that off.
I'm finding multiple fractures.
Exact cause and time are indeterminate.
Degree of decomp and adipocere formation suggests
She hasn't been dead that long.
Maybe three days in the water, one on the beach?
Hey, guys, um, just a heads-up,
Brennan is on her way in.
She is?
Well, booth must've told her about the case, 'cause i didn't contact her.
Well, for whatever reason,
The lab is where she wants to be right now.
Is that some sort of a picture?
It was in the victim's travel belt.
I sent the original to angela.

Anything else on the victim?
Just a passport, house key.
We really don't know much.

Older sister said she's been traveling a lot.
Hmm.

Yeah, she's, uh, she's on her way.
Right.

Well, she's, you know, given her history and all,
She's a lot tougher than she should be.
Um, let me know when the older sister gets in, will you?
Booth?

There was nothing that you could've done.
Yeah, maybe not in the moment,
But there's a lot that i could've done.
Hi!
Cam said you had something for me?
Oh...
How are you?
everyone keeps asking me that.
I don't know how to answer that question.
Okay.

They're adjusting, but we've had a few days all together,
And i think they're relieved to get back to routine.
Yeah.
Was this found with the victim?
Yeah.

The water damage to figure out what it is.
Looks like a painting.
I actually think it's a photograph of a painting
Printed on regular printer paper.
All the blue, maybe a seascape.
Temperance.
Sully?
Whoa.
Oh...
Uh...
Uh, we'll just give you two a minute.
Bye.

Where did he come from?
I have no idea.
Security just said that we had a visitor.
Hey, who's the dude that's hooking up with dr.

Tim sullivan.

And he is?
The only guy besides booth
Who ever stood a chance.
Thank you.
Probably not too smart, though.
Of course they're smart.

Oh, i know.
Why are you here?
Not just on the east coast, i mean...

I found out what happened with your dad,
And i wanted to check on you.
You've aged.
Uh, yes.

What about the woman?
Um, the one who plays the clarinet?
Oboe.

Oboe.

Uh, so i'm not sure there's a future there.
Well, statistically speaking, if she's young,
There's more of a chance of a future with her
Than with someone your own age.
It is good to see you, tempe.
You, too.
There's beveling on the left scapula,
As well as damage on the third and fourth left vertebral ribs.
Well, all consistent with a gunshot.
Mm-hmm.
Though soft tissue suggests it was low velocity.
Agreed.
Let's talk about this sully character.
Exactly how long were he and dr.

Not very long.

I'm surprised, dr.

I didn't take you for a workplace gossip type of guy.
I'm not, i'm just concerned.
Dr. Brennan is in a vulnerable place right now,
And i think the timing of this visit
Seems awfully convenient.
You talking about sully?
Oh, he is not a predator, trust me.
He's one of the nicest guys around.
Are you here to swab something?

Oh, so it turns out that the only thing i could find
In the external chest wound, besides sea water,
Were trace amounts of parafavella gigantea
And helicostomella algae.
Nothing to link us to the weapon?
No, i'm not giving up.

Be my guest.
Dr. Edison?

Will you look at this?
There's something embedded in the adipocere.
Yes, what is that?
Well, it looks like a bone.
A fragment or something vestigial?
I'm not sure.
Uh, hey, cam?
There's a piece of string adhered
To the tissue there, you see that?
Maybe that's something that the victim was wearing.
Let me get this straight, you make sandwiches?
Yeah, and i even named one after you.
Triple-decker with roast beef, pastrami, swiss cheese.
All right, is that on rye?

I approve.

I want a sandwich.
You have one, the tempe tempeh.
Excuse me, folks.

How you doing?

Work with booth and brennan.
Tim sullivan, former special agent,
Now professional sandwich maker.
Oh.

We got to get back to the case, so...
Oh, no, of course.
Hey, how about dinner tomorrow, on me?
That would be nice.
Okay.
Uh, i'll see you then.
Our parents died in a car crash 14 years ago.
That's when your sister suffered those breaks?
We were both in the car.
I was 18.

But sarah, she was only eight.
She went to go live with our grandmother.
Your mom's mom, right?

She passed away, what, four months ago?
Yes.

She took it hard.
It's understandable.
And she was sort of adrift.
I thought traveling would help.
Why newfoundland?

Maybe she just wanted to go somewhere that was far away.
Listen, we're We're still working on the water damage to this picture.
Does that look familiar to you?
Do you recognize that at all?
I think this is a painting my grandmother had.
Any idea why sarah would've been
Carrying around a copy of it with her?
No.

I have a husband, and a baby on the way.
Why do i feel like i don't have a family anymore?
So these pictures, this is all newfoundland?
It's similar, right?
And look at this.
This is the painting signature.
"stella lewis."
The victim's grandmother painted this.
Yeah, and she called it secret harbor.
What's so secret?

Maybe she went there to find out.

So speaking of secrets, i just met tim sullivan.
Now, am i imagining things,
Or is there some kind of history there?
Tell me everything.
That was clark.
So the fragment found with the victim
Is a piece of animal bone.
Apparently she was wearing it.
What do you mean, like a necklace?

Its apparent age suggests it was some sort of relic.
Clark is checking with the human artifacts division,
See if they can figure out where it came from.
Have you heard back from the state department yet?
The royal canadian mounted police
Have agreed to full fbi involvement.
That's great!
When-when do you leave?
I'm not going.
But you're the lead on the case.
You're about to bury your dad.

Booth, you asked what you could do,
How you could help.
I think it would be good for me
To be alone for a few days.
Okay.

You want me to go, i'll go.
So, the dung on the victim's boot
Came from rangifer tarandus,
Otherwise known as...
Boreal woodland caribou.
How did you know that?
Oh, yeah, right.
I forgot i still had that up there.
Okay.

Two types of lichen in the dung.
Oh, also, hey, fun fact.
Old man's beard, it can be used at toilet paper in a pinch.
I'm sorry.

Old man's beard.

Good to know.

They do, yeah.

In varying concentrations around the island.
The animal bone we found with the victim.
It's a needle...
For nalebinding.
Uh, nal-what?
Nalebinding.
It's an ancient precursor to knitting, and this
Particular style of nalebinding needle most closely resembles
Those used by...

Like seafaring raider type vikings?
Well, two years ago, in scotland, a man found
A viking hoard that was later valued at over $2 million.
Well, if our victim found something similar...
Well, then maybe it got her killed.
Well, it's nice out now.

Mauzy?

oh, it's slang up here
For damp and foggy.
I've been studying.

What do you got?

Minute traces of carbon-reinforced polymer
And, apparently, venison jerky.
Jerky?
Found venison jerky on the murder weapon.
All right.

Mauzy?

Special agent booth,
Special agent aubrey?

I'm so disappointed.
I'm officer gilda sandling,
The rcmp officer assigned to this case.
Pleasure to meet you.

What's that?
Oh, my one and only attempt
To sound like a newfie.
Not bad.

The term newfie's considered offense coming from a c.F.A.
non-native.

What?

Thought one of you could take the rental car and go
And check her out.

Can stay with me and we'll ride along the coastal roads,
And see if we can't find a match to that painting you sent.
Who's the witness?
Short-term rental owner, said sarah abbott was a tenant.
Woman's a bit of a local celebrity, actually.
Makes gourmet venison jerky.
I'll take that one.
You got it.
Chest wound directionality is posterior to anterior.
Perimortem fractures on the posterior plane
Suggests that she was then struck repeatedly.
Possibility of an undiscovered
Viking settlement is certainly exciting.
I suppose so.
You have my approval
To pursue an investigation,
As long as you can assure me
That your work on this case will not suffer.
You serious?
Thank you, dr.

Teriyaki'sstill my biggest seller, but...
The black pepper cider's
Hot on its heels.
Wow, thank you.
Uh, now.

Gretchen.
So, like, how widely available is your jerky, gretchen?
Oh, i can ship it anywhere.

No.

But i'm asking in context of the case.
There might've been jerky at the crime scene.
Oh, no.
Well, honestly, my jerky's sold
All over the island,
Even in a few stores on the mainland.

Hey, so, do you remember the last time you saw sarah?
Last tuesday night.
A man had given sarah a ride home from somewhere.
Hmm.

About what time was that?
Uh, a little past 10:00.
Seems this man had gotten the wrong idea.
He sound threatening?

"you're gonna regret this."
You think you could describe him, or... i wrote down his license plate number.
Just in case.
Oh.
Theguyrenting the car is adam hitchcock.
He's an american.

He's in the area scouting out a site for him and his dad
To build a new luxury resort.

Wait a second, his dad's david hitchcock,
Big real estate developer.
No wonder his kid's an ass.
I know, right?

My brain immediately turns it into rich...
Get it, aubrey.

His temporary offices aren't too far from here.
Let's go and see if he wants to talk.
Okay.
Okay.

I've already submitted for permits.
Mr. Hitchcock,
This is fbi special agent booth.
Look, did you know sarah abbott?
Who?
Oh, that girl.
Yeah, i met her.

Mr. Hitchcock.
Showed up dead two days later.
What?

I met her at a bar, okay?
She was showing people this painting of a cove.
I offered to drive her around, look for it.
Why did you tell her she'd regret turning you down?
Who wouldn't regret turning me down?

How about julia henshaw?
Remember her?

Who accused you of sexual assault?
The case was settled.

How about the reports where you blackmail contractors
If they don't do what you tell them to do?

Agent booth...

Who doesn't understand the word no.

You better watch it.

You harassed a vulnerable young woman who was in mourning
And now she's dead.
Thank you, mr.

My colleague is out of line.

You're damn right he is.
You can return to work now.

Sorry, you tried to muzzle me in front of a suspect?
Let me explain.
This is an economically depressed area.
We can't afford to just chase away major development.
It doesn't matter if this guy's a murderer?

We need to have solid evidence first.
Fine, i got it.

I'm sorry, agent booth.
I'm really not trying to shut you out here.
Of course you're not.

Well, i had to go to work in that shirt.
You did?

Well, what-what...

Just i had to wear my jacket the entire day.
It was 90 degrees.

People thought i was crazy.
So...
Feel like telling me about your dad?
I'm, i'm happy to listen.
Max was a criminal,
Who did terrible things.
But he was also sweet
And... silly.
He abandoned me,
And, oh, made me... made it difficult for me
To ever trust another man,
And yet...
He loved you.
Yes.
I don't know why i'm crying.
It's okay.
No, i mean, i don't know...
Why i'm crying with you.
And booth is the one who's been here.
He's the one i've...
Built my life with, so why am i Letting you in
When he feels so far away?
Grief, it's...
It does things.
It mixes you up.
Do you remember when we met, and my fbi partner
Had just died the year before?
Yeah.

But you seemed so open, so fearless.
Uh, yeah.

That i owned and ran away from the first woman
I ever truly loved.
You said you'd come back.
I know.
So, why didn't you?
Because somewhere deep down, i knew where this was going.
It's probably why i left in the first place.
I mean, if i'd have come back, i'd have had to deal
With the fact that you still wouldn't choose me.
So, by staying away i got to hold on to the fantasy
That i was your one that got away.
That's an extremely flawed strategy.
Look, you're gonna get through this.
I mean, yeah, it's gonna hurt for a while,
But just give yourself some time.
You know, booth's not going anywhere.
What are you working on, exactly?
I'm attempting...
Satellite archeology,
Looking for shadows, soil marks, denser plant growth.
You know, any combination of these could suggest
Earlier disturbances, even buried features.
Such as, like, a viking settlement?
Exactly.
Okay, move over then, 'cause that is awesome!
Cross sections show a distinct lack of kinetic trauma.
I don't think it was a gunshot.
Well, the fractures on the scapula suggest
Both sharp force and projectile trauma.
An arrow.
Right, like one
Used for hunting.
Such a brutal way to kill someone.
There.
A broadhead-- that explains the carbon fiber
Dr. Hodgins found.

For the stems.

Explain the venison jerky;
If the killer was eating some
Right before loading an arrow...
The particulates would have transferred.
You should tell booth.
Oh, aren't you-- you want me...
Yes, i will call him right now.
Dude, you're beeping.
Yeah, that's your fault.
'cause that's the results that you wanted
From the fractures.
Let's take a look here.
These look like the injuries were all made by rocks,
Coastal ones.
She must have fallen.
Probably from quite a height.
So, say she was standing on a cliff or a bluff,
Or, you know, somewhere above the ocean.

She gets shot.

Flips in midair,
And falls flat on her back.
Right on the rocks.
Tide came up, washed her to sea.
Okay, great.
So all we have to do is locate a cliff
That's a correct distance above a rocky coastline
To account for the severity of the fractures,
And we've got ourselves our murder site.
Like right there!
Or there.

There.
Yeah, maybe we should just go back
To searching for vikings.
Might be easier.
Hey.
Rick's sporting goods and hunting adventures.
Gilda says that's where everyone in the area
Gets their hunting supplies.
You coming?
Why don't you take this one, all right?

I'm gonna dig a little deeper on this adam hitchcock guy.
I got a gut feeling about him.
Uh, look, it's none of my business,
Correct, it's not...

I don't know anything, really, but...
Whatever's going on right now,
I'm sure you guys will get through it.
Well, just let me know
What you find from the arrowheads there, okay?
Yeah.
Thanks, aubrey.
Hey,
What did you have to show me?
So, i've been finding out more about
Grandma stella's painting,
Which means i've been finding out more
About grandma stella
Herself.
Stella anders and philip lewis.
So, philip was in the army, but
Before they were married, he was stationed
At a u.S. Run military base...
In newfoundland.
And who are these people?
That's a family that lived near the base,
The andreassens.
The oldest daughter, estelle,
Was the same age as the victim's grandmother.
So, you think estelle andreassen
And stella anders are the same person?
The victim wasn't looking for vikings.
She was looking for her grandmother's history.
Her home.
Kathleen here is the daughter of owner rick.
She's been hunting since she was ten.
Six.
Oh, we should get some of this.
For evidence?
For snacks.
Here's what i think you're looking for.
Cutting diameter one to one-eighth of an inch,
Multi-blade.
Bow used probably draws between 60
And 65 pounds, does draw lengths
Between 28 and 29 inches.

Do you keep a record of who buys these?
Not at all.
And we sell a ton.
Anyone who goes bow hunting out here for big game
Is gonna want something like this.
I hear someone interested in hunting?
Yeah, well, in a manner of speaking.
Ah.

I've been a hunting guide on the island for over 40 years.
Where you visiting from?
D.C.-

We're here about a murder, rick.
A young woman.
You recognize her?
No.

What about adam hitchcock?
That name ring a bell?
Yeah, rich guy.
I took him out, oh,
About a week and a half ago.
Does he use a gun or a bow?
Bow.
A real pain in my ass.
Got him a black bear,
A good sized one, too, but, uh,
He said he wanted a caribou,
Complained he's got a bear head back at home.
Now, that...
I've seen.
The painting?
No, not the painting,
The harbor.
Yeah.
I think i've seen that on the andreassen property.
Yeah, family's got tons of land.
You think they were related?
Well, look, if the victim's grandmother was an andreassen,
Then that means the victim was, too.
Thatfamily's got over 300 acres
Of pristine oceanfront property.
Rumor is adam hitchcock wants to buy it
For upwards of $24 million.
Well, that's an amount that you might not want to share
With a suddenly appearing long-lost relative.
Yeah, my thoughts exactly.
Look, i'm arriving now.
We'll be there in five.
Hey, excuse me.
You live here?
Whoa!
easy.
All right.
Easy.
Come on.

Up.

Who come on to your property, pal?
If i was actually trying to shoot you,
I wouldn't have missed.
I was just trying to scare you.
Why?
I thought you worked for that adam guy.
Adam hitchcock?

Harassing my wife, trying to get her to sell this place.
These arrows are all fieldheads.
They aren't used for hunting.
Right, okay.
We have reason to believe that
This woman was on your property.
You recognize her?
Oh, my god.

Doug...

It's okay, honey.
There's been a mistake.
Wait, that's sarah.
Why do you have that?
You knew her?

Oh, my god, did something happen to her?
You found something that could help locate the murder site?
I think so.
There was extensive damage on the cortical surface
Due to postmortem scavenging, but...
Look at what the scratches reveal here
And here.
Staining.

An underlying pattern
Of contusions.
Hey.

Yes.

On the frontal and right zygomatic.
We just need your help to determine
What might have caused the injuries.
Okay, um, well, send me all the data
And i'll see what i can do.
I, uh...
I need to get some air.
So, is everything set for your dad's service?
Yes.
It will be simple.
Are you and hodgins coming?
Yeah, of course.
Is your brother gonna be there?
Russ can't make it.
He and amy and the girls
Are coming to visit us this summer, and...
We'll do something nice for my dad then.
Brennan, i really think that you should talk to booth.
He's your husband.
You can share some of this with him.
Maybe i don't want to.
Maybe, when i try,
I end up worrying about him.
About whether he feels responsible for what happened,
And how i can...

That he's not.
That i-i don't blame him.
I just don't feel like worrying about anyone right now.
Is that wrong?
No.
I...

I met her at the grocer's.
She was putting up a copy of this painting,
Asking for information.

I said it's on my property.
And you drove her out here yourself?

The painting, her grandmother.
What about her grandmother?
That she'd lived here as child.
We figured out that my mother and sarah's grandmother
Must have been friends when they were little.

They told us all the same stories about this place.
They used to find things-- bits of metal, petrified nuts.
My mother kept a small tin full of stuff.
And sarah showed me something her grandmother gave her.
She had it around her neck.
Techs aren't finding anything.
Look, is there any chance that sarah might have been
Anywhere else on the property by herself?
Sure.

Even if doug and i were at work.
Ms. Andreassen, we'd have to do genetic testing to be certain,
But there's a chance that your mother
And sarah's grandmother were related.
How?
We think they were sisters.
So that's what caused the bone bruising on the victim's face.
Yeah.

They're located all over the property.
That way you can still follow the trails,
Even when there's snow on the ground.
Are there any near the coastline?
Uh, i'm scanning the entire property now,
Using those satellite photos that you gave me.
Each time we find a spot that has everything
That we're looking for, we...

Sharp drop, rocky oceanfront.

I send the coordinates to aubrey and he sends a tech team there.
Wait, they found secret harbor?
Yeah, it looks just like the painting, right?
Aubrey sent it.
The techs searched the area,
But they didn't find anything.
C-could you pull up the satellite view
Of that spot for me, please?

Let me just figure out what quadrant...
Yeah, okay.

Please, pull it up right here.
Oh, okay.

Okay, here.
Leave it up on the screen.
Hodgins!
What?
Hodgins!
Yeah,
There's some blood right here.
All right, people.
We're in the right spot so keep looking.
If the victim was shot and she fell back there,
She didn't just topple into the ocean.
No, her killer must've dragged her to the edge,
Pushed her off.

Recently made ground holes.
Could be the result of a portable hunting blind.
Plus, i found this.
Well, that's thoughtful.

Some jerky and some fingerprints.
I'll run the prints.
Looks like we found our killer, huh?
Hey, come on, come on, come on.
Come on.
What?

Look.

Wow...
The growth pattern, it's undeniable.
What are you guys talking about?
Wait, i heard yelling.
Did we find something?
Vikings, cam.
We found vikings.
Are they teeny, tiny vikings?
Uh, no, look,
See how the grass growth here
Is darker, denser?
It's because depressions in the soil caused more
Moisture to collect there,
Providing an almost perfect silhouette
Of a buried structure.
There could be an entire settlement here
To excavate.
I have to contact the jeffersonian research division.
Excuse me.
Aubrey says they got an i.D.
Kathleen tobine.
I'm afraid you need to come with us.
Hey!
What the hell you think you're doing?
Mr. Tobine, your daughter is under arrest.
For what?
Trespassing,
Attempted poaching and murder.
Kathleen?
I'm sorry, dad.

Well, this is just great.

A full confession.
Said she was hunting illegally
On private property
And accidentally shot sarah abbott.
That's great.

Only booth doesn't believe her,
Says it doesn't feel right.
I agree.
You do?

The victim was killed here and then
Dragged to the edge of the sea cliff and dropped,
Meaning she would've landed...
Okay, let me get you a parabola.
The victim landed right about here.
Exactly, but the injuries are consistent
With this area here that's rockier.
So, how did
The victim end up that far out?
She wasn't pushed.
She was held by her hands and feet and swung out
Parallel to the ground.
The victim was thrown.
So, someone else was there.
Two days ago, adam hitchcock made an offer
On your land for $3 million more
Than what it's worth.
It was a payoff, wasn't it?
You didn't kill sarah abbott.
Adam hitchcock did, right?
He was so stuck on getting that damn caribou.
He told me he'd hire me and my dad to run the hunting tours
At his new resort if i could help find him one.
A job like that's worth a lot of money.
Of course it is.
I knew there was some on the andreassen land
This time of year.

We were in the blind,
And adam saw movement...
And he just took a shot.
And it was sarah.
It was awful.
Why didn't you report it?
Well, adam, he said he knew her,
Even left a bar with her the night before.
He said there was no way authorities would
Believe it was just an accident.
So, he paid
You to help him get rid of the body?
I may not have killed that girl,
But...
If it wasn't for me,
She'd still be alive.
Hey.
Hi.
So, i'm heading to the airport,
Came to say good-bye.
Good-bye, sully.
Thank you for everything.
Any time.
Stay in touch, okay?
I will.
Oh, um...
The oboe player...
Do you love her?
Yeah, yeah, i-i do.
Does she love you?
Apparently, yes.

You know, she's a 28-year-old symphony musician.
I am a 45-year-old former fbi agent
Who owns a sandwich shop.
So?
So...
So, i see your point.
Good.
Bye, tempe.
Bye, sully.
I'm telling you, with the evidence that we've got,
As well as kathleen's testimony,
That guy does not stand a chance.
Ah!

Good.

Yeah.

You got the funding?
Yes.

With the andreassens
To set up a start date for the excavation dig.
Amazing, okay.
To vikings.

With tess and lucy's permission,
I ran some genetic tests
Just to confirm that they were related.
And are they?
Yes, but beyond that...
They also share
Fragments of a norse haplogroup.
Embedded in a first nation's genome.
And appearing to date back 30 generations.
Well, okay, m-meaning what, exactly?
They're descended from vikings.
Okay, that is incredible.

To vikings!
Yes.

Welcome home.
It's good to be home.
I'm glad you're back.
Me, too.
The kids are asleep?
Yes.

Go in and give them kisses.
Yeah, of course.
What are you working on?
My dad's eulogy;

I'm not sure if it's any good.
No, bones, it's gonna
Be great 'cause it's coming
From the heart,
All right?
Booth, about sully...

Have to explain yourself about sully.
It's okay.

Yes, but...
I want you to understand why he's important.
It's because without sully
I don't think i would've been ready for you,
For this...
And because of that,
I will always be grateful to him,
Because...

I love you.
I love you, bones...
Always.
In norse mythology,
There is a place called valhalla.
It is the home of the gods,
But it is also the place where the bravest warriors
Get to spend their afterlives.
After each battle, the valkyries or...
Spirit women, ride amongst the fallen soldiers,
Deciding which ones fought bravely enough
To enter the land of the gods.
My father gave his life to protect...
My children.
It's that kind of bravery
I imagine would impress a valkyrie,
But the impulse
To protect one's offspring is...
Innate, it's hardwired.
How could he...
Possibly have done any less?
To me, the bravest battle
Max keenan ever fought
Was the one he began over ten years ago
When he reentered my life.
Since then, every day...
He has fought to show me how much he loves me And to make me believe that i could trust him again.
And he won that fight...
But i do believe
I was truly blessed to have
A father like max keenan,
A father who loved me so very much.
