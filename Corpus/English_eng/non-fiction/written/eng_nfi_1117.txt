[snoring] [mutters] Oh, God.
Oh, God.
[grunts] [inhales deeply] Hey.
- Hi.

[Gus sniffles] [grunting and sighing]
Oh, my God.
I just had the weirdest dream.
I dreamt that I killed Osama bin Laden.
And then, like, when I went to look at the body...
- it was Macaulay Culkin.

- What do you think that means?

Maybe, like, deep down, Osama bin Laden was just a scared little boy?
[both chuckle]
Or maybe he'd still be alive if he'd booby-trapped his house à la Home Alone.
[chuckling] Right.
Yeah, if he'd just left out some Micro Machines,
SEAL Team Six would have slipped on 'em.
- Shit.

- [Mickey sighs]

Nothing.

- and I already missed it. [sighs]

[stammers] What, the sex and love addicts...
Yeah... [chuckles]
- Already fucking up.

Well, can you go to another one?

Yeah, I think there's an eleven o'clock.

- Mmm-hmm.

- I smell like BO and tacos.

Could I take a shower here?
I don't wanna walk into a meeting smelling like this.
Oh, yeah, sure.
[stammers] You know what?

Maybe I'll go get some coffees...

- Okay?

I'll make sure to turn off that spy cam in the shower, too.
That was a little creepy.

Okay.
[yawning] Oh, shit.
- Charlie, what up?

Hey!
I'm back.
Um, there was only one towel in there.
Oh, yeah.

- You only own one towel?

Big red. [chuckles]
So you have one towel and three half-empty bottles of shampoo?
I have very particular hair.
My mom says I look like Michael Landon.
I don't know who that is.
He's, uh, Pa?

- Never watched that.

People also tell me I look like Rachel Maddow, which I take as a huge compliment.
I would.

Yeah, they're in the dresser there.
Uh, top left-hand drawer.
To the right of that are sort of, like, polo shirts, and then...
If you're feeling a little cold, you can do a sweater or sweatshirt situation.
- That's to the right.

Hey, perfect.
- [Mickey] All right, I gotta go.

So, um, when do you want to hang out again?
Um... [sighs]
I...

Even if we're not hooking up,
I think it's better for me if I don't couple up right now.
Yeah, no.

Um... [smacks lips] So...
Sure.
Yeah, so maybe touch base in, like... a week?
A week, great.

I was gonna say that.

So that's perfect.
And does that mean we're, uh...
- Are we texting during that time?

- I don't think texting is a good idea.

As you know, I can go a little crazy with the texting.
So let's keep that to an emergency-only situation.
Okay, yeah.
- If I get hit by a bus, I'll text you.

- Don't call 911.

Just text me an emoji of a sad face and a hospital, and...
Great.
- [sighs] - [keys jangling]
What a night we had.
Yeah.

- Goodbye.

- See ya!

Of course, yeah.

- [grunts lightly]

[sighs] [farting]
[sighs] [theme music playing]
[Mickey] Hi, I'm Mickey.

[people in group] Hi, Mickey.
So there's this guy that I like.
I do.

Uh, and I slept at his place last night, but we didn't do anything.
We didn't have sex.
We just talked and laughed and whatever.
Uh, the point is we didn't do anything, and I feel really good about that.
And I want to keep taking things slowly.
But... if I'm honest with myself, what I really wanna do is just text him right now and try and hang out with him all day.

Like, uh, my neighbor is having this dinner party thing later, and I just really, really wish I could bring him with me.
But...
I am trying to do things differently this time and just hope that it turns out... okay.
I don't know.
[whirring softly]
[thudding] [whirring stops]
[Chris sing-song] There he is!
Mr. Balcony!
- Morning, Chris.

- This is your shoe, I assume.

- That's a good system.

- You could have just texted me.

What would you rather have, a text or a shoe?
Yeah, I'd take a text, too.

How did it end up with that girl last night?
She get out of here, or did you guys...

Oh, um...
I could come over so we don't have to be yelling this.
I can hear you.

Uh, no, we didn't...

- Oh.

We just talked and hung out, and it was fun.
Cool.
- What are you doing tonight?

- Yeah?

You wanna hang out?
- Get some buddies together?

I got money from both my grandmas for my birthday.
So I'm ready to spend, baby.
Let's keep in touch.

Hey, my shoe.
Oh!

[Chris grunts]
- It's all right.

[Chris] Hey, there's another one down there!
- Hey!

Crazy.
I ended up spending the night at Gus' and, uh... it's, uh...
It's a long story.

Good.

- Wow!

He's actually very virile.

What are you up to tonight?
Supposed to go to Syd's for this dinner party.
- Fun.

It's gonna be me and three couples.

- Do you want to come with me?

They do ska.

I don't think it's a good idea for me to hang out with him all the time.
Why?
'Cause I'm a sex and love addict.
Okay.
And I'm an alcoholic, which you may have already guessed.
[stammers] Right.
I want you to know that I'm not currently engaging in any of that behavior, even the sex and love stuff.
Um...
I just... thought I should tell you.
- Wow, this is a lot to take in.

Well, I want you to know that I, um... [stutters] I'm here for you, whatever you might need.
- I'm here for you.

Thank you.

- I thought you should know.

Yeah.

I know this is very much about you, but can I just say...
I'm just, like...

- [chuckles]

I thought I was doing something wrong.

No!

This feels really good to know this.
This conversation is very freeing.

Um, so have you told anybody else?
Just Gus.
- So, no other female friends?

Oh...
I cut up a rabbit once.
What?
When I was eight, I found a dead rabbit in the yard, and I picked it up with a plastic bag, and then I cut it into small pieces, and I put the pieces in a bowl in the shed.
[takes deep breath] I'm gonna get ready for Syd's now.
- Okay.

- Great.

- Yeah.

I...

[sighs heavily] Good talk.

[all laughing and talking indistinctly]
[Syd] Hey!
- I'm so glad you came.

- [Gus] So, if on Friends...

Ross references Die Hard, that means in the Friends universe Die Hard exists as a movie.
- Right?

- Okay.

So when later Bruce Willis shows up as Ross' girlfriend's dad
- on the show Friends...

why aren't all the friends like,
"Holy shit!
This guy looks like Bruce Willis from the movie Die Hard.
I wanna fucking kill myself from the shock!"
Gus, I think you spend a lot of time thinking about Friends.
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about it.
[all chuckling]
- [Justin] I don't know.

I still don't understand.

- [all laughing] - [Gus] I'm just saying,
I wish TV shows and movies just obeyed those rules a little bit.
Why are you talking quieter?

Are you grounded?

- No, am I talking quieter?

[all laughing]
I guess I just, uh, became self-aware of how dorky this conversation is, and I don't want anybody to overhear us, so...
Those girls can't hear you!

- Oh, we can hear you.

Yeah, it's the dorkiest conversation ever.
[men laughing]
Just when you think you're gonna get out of it, you go deeper!
Do we... do we at least sound smart?

- Don't get me wrong.

I am always up for talking about Friends.

Oh, I love it!

You know what you're talking about.
- [woman] Oh, I know.

- Cool chicks!

Yeah.

Hey, this is, uh, Randy and Wade.

- Hi.

- This is Gus.

- Hi, I'm Lauren.

- I'm Kali.

I'm wondering, are we allowed to talk about things other than continuity errors in our favorite '90s sitcoms?
[Justin] I think so.
I don't think we've tackled Dharma and Greg.
Oh, that's a good one.
[Kali] I always notice...

[Syd] There are companies that will come and clean out the diapers for you.
But, of course, his mom wanted me to do it myself.
- [Shaun] Why?

So, tell me if this is super obnoxious, but Harrison's about to turn one.
- Can I ask you about preschools?

- It gets cutthroat.

Yeah, we were filling out applications when Liz was in her third trimester.
Yeah, we were filling out forms for preschool before we met.
- [Shaun] Oh, my God.

What about the Center for Early Education?
- You guys have Otis there?

We can't say enough good things about it.

- The kids grow tomatoes, cucumbers...

He's into eating salad now.

He said, "I wanna be a kale farmer."
- [indistinct chatter]

Did you hear about that police chase last night?
I was at the Springwood, and the cops showed up...
I'm so sorry.

What's the one where they learn at their individual paces?
- Waldorf.

You don't wanna go to Waldorf.
They don't want any brands or labels.
So, if your kid wears a Disney character T-shirt, they will...
- send them home.

They have a little preschool firing squad.
So, we're at East Side Family School.

They let the kids run around barefoot.

So I get to pay $20,000 a year for my kid to run around in chicken shit and parasites?
When we were going to school, it was free. [chuckles]
- [all talking indistinctly] - [Syd] Stop.
[Liz] There are not parasites.

- [Brian] Oh, okay.

[Syd] Oh, my God.

But it doesn't mean my kid's not gonna get whooping cough because every other parent in this city is a selfish idiot.
[Liz] Can you imagine not caring and being, like,
"I'm just not gonna vaccinate my kid.

This is going to blow your mind.

- Eww.

- Ugh.

- [Lorna] So terrible.

What if we played TableTopics?
Pinworms ruin...

I don't wanna talk about pinworms.
I wanna play TableTopics.

[all speaking indistinctly]
- [music playing]

[all cheering]
So, what else keeps you up at night?
Well, Uber mostly, 'cause I do it part-time.
And club promoting.

- [Lauren] Oh, yeah?

- Is this a job interview?

- I want to know.

What shows do you work on?
- Swamp Ghosts.

- Swamp Ghosts?

- I like Swamp Ghosts.

- I'll give you an autograph later.

- I don't have a job.

I was gonna ask him.
- [all chuckle]

Um, steakhouse waiter/ stuntman/entrepreneur.
- [Lauren] Whoa.

[Randy] That's not a job.

[Justin] You guys are hilarious.
Hey.
- Hey!

- What's up?

How's it going?
- It's going all right.

So, I dunno. [stammers] What do you do?
Oh, uh, I'm an on-set teacher.
- All right.

I work on the show Witchita.
Oh, my God.
- [stammers] You know it?

- You're a fan?

- Oh, cool.

Yeah, it's the most hate-watched show on television.
- I believe it.

- Yeah, it's...

But in the best way.

Thank you.

- So, where're you from?

- I'm from Michigan.

Midwesterners... [both] in the house.

Midwest forever.
[both chuckle]
Hey, you know, I'm gonna go get another drink.
- Mmm-hmm.

Uh, no.

Come on.

- You know...

- one Midwesterner to another?

Uh, I'm...

So, it'll be a waste of money for you to get me a drink, 'cause I'm still...

- Thank you.

[sighs] [chuckles] Yeah.
[indistinct chatter]
Hey, what's up, man?

- Hey!

- What's up?

- You phone worm. [laughs]

[chuckles] I know.

- Yeah.

- Yeah, no, I'm...

- I'm having a good time.

- Yeah, it's great.

- So much fun.

- Yeah!

Come on, what's up?

- [chuckles]

I don't mean to be a baby or whatever.

I thought this was going to be a boys' night out.
It is.

Right.

I don't know.

- What?

This whole thing we're doing, you know?
Aren't we past this by now?
Like, a group of guys all getting together and trying to...
- flirt and hit on girls?

- No, that's awesome.

'Cause I just...

Yeah, that's beautiful, man.
Whatever.

- Yeah.

And back to the phone.
"What possession of your partner's would you throw out if you could?"
- [Syd] Mmm.

- Your Grateful Dead tank top.

It's so disgusting.
Um, why do I have a life-size Reggie Jackson in my house?

- [both chuckling] - [Jeff] I can't keep it in the garage.
It'll get moldy.

- And maybe it'll pay for Otis' college.

All right.

- How about you, Mick?

So, pass, I guess.
I'm sorry.

What about that...

Gus?

Oh, that's too bad.

- Yeah, like the sexual dynamo?

- [chuckles] - [Syd] Don't say that.

I know.
Oh, you were serious?
- [laughing] Oh, honey, I'm so sorry!

- Wow.

A new question.
Um...
Ooh, okay.
If you could sleep with someone in your partner's family,
- who would it be?

Easy.

What?

All right.

- [chuckles]

- You'd fuck my sister?

[Shaun] You think she's prettier than me?
She's the best looking in your family.
Do you want me to pick an unattractive member of your family?
You guys are always having your own private conversations about music.
- It is so fucking pretentious.

- She interned at Sub Pop.

She's a great tambourine player.
What the fuck?

Anybody can play the motherfucking tambourine.
That is not true.

- You don't understand...

[Syd and Jeff] Another card.
No, no, no.

Okay.

I would fuck your cousin Annette.
- Who?

She was dancing near us wearing a green dress.
I think she works for Alaska Airlines.

That's not my cousin.
That's my family friend's daughter.
And she's half your age.
Okay, that's who I choose to fuck.

I'm not saying you're old.

Was that card even real?

No, what're you talking about?
- I'm checking the cards.

- Go ahead, check.

- I think I know what's going on.

- What difference does it make?

Oh, my gosh.

Well, I'm looking, and I don't see anything.
This is classic bullshit.

- [Syd] It's a game.

I came to have fun.

She put it in the middle.

- Jesus Christ.

You made it up.

You hate us because we have families with children.
I don't hate you 'cause you have a family with kids.
You're just a little bit boring!
Oh, I'm sorry we can't be as cool as Mickey Dobbs.
You guys, stop it.

So you were fucking with us?
- I mean, that's what's happening here?

I'm sorry I tried to liven this party up a little bit and get away from talking about the Waldorf School and princess dresses and pinworms.
I just... can't stand it!
Sorry, I've ruined everything again.

What the fuck?
Wow.
- Damn.

Okay, I'll go now.
"What body part are you most attracted to?"
[Liz] On myself?
- Your dad's dick.

- I'm just trying to have fun.

Who here has had a pedicure and will admit it?
- I've had one before.

- I have never had a pedicure.

[indistinct chatter]
- Hey.

Hello.
So, um, what's your problem?
- My problem?

I'm sorry.

What...
I just wanna let you know that I'm, like, not interested in hooking up tonight.
You thought that I was flirting with you?
Well, weren't you?

Go fuck yourself, okay?

Oh.

- Okay, I didn't know that.

I've spent exactly zero seconds thinking about hooking up with you.
Wait, so, like, why were you even talking to me this whole time?
Because I'm friendly.

- Uh-huh.

[normal] I'm not gonna stay home because my boyfriend's out of town.
All right.

- So I'm gonna get outta here.

- Yeah?

Oh, walk away, big guy.
- Tough guy.

I am obviously sorry for the...
Holy shit.

I know that's not significant for you, but for me, that's so fucking crazy that I'm seeing Michael Landon right now.
You're an asshole.
Don't leave.

Hey, let me buy you a drink.

- Hey, man, you okay?

I was just taking a picture of Michael Landon.
- Who?

I don't think I'm in the right headspace for this, so I'm gonna get outta here.
Come on.

I know and I love that about you, Chris.

You're the best, man.
- But I'm gonna get outta here.

- I'll see you around?

Okay.

- Nice to meet you.

Whatever.
