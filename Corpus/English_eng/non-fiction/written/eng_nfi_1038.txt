Ten years later, a new generation of warriors rises up to protect the Ninja Power Stars.
It's Morphin Time!

Where are you taking us, Preston?
You'll see.
Isn't that the ribbon tree?

(Sarah) Awesome!
(Calvin) Oh, man!
(Brody) I remember it from when I was a kid.
Look at it!

But I don't...

Yeah, what's the deal?
It's so great.
You tie a ribbon to symbolize important moments, like family, friends.

Cal and I put one up on our anniversary.
Well, now we'll all be on the tree together.
Tada!

Brody, Preston, Calvin, Haley, Sarah, Levi.
Mm-hmm.

That's a great idea.
- Well, let's put it up.

(Calvin) How about right here?

(man) Let's go, boys.
(man) Clear the way, kids.
This tree is coming down to make way for a new building.
They're cutting down the ribbon tree?
They can't do that.
Can they?

Unless you want to put a ribbon on it, you can't touch this tree.
Oh, really?

(man) The boss is here.

What's the holdup?
I want this tree down immediately, or I'll use your Christmas bonuses to buy a new jet.
Sorry, Mr. Tien, but those kids are in the way.
Kids?

Preston?
Oh, hi...

Oh, hi...

- That's your dad?

Don't tell me you have something to do with this.
What do you think you're doing?
Well, we were just gonna put a ribbon on... (Mr. Tien) A ribbon?

All these ribbons are gonna be trashed.
This tree is coming down today.
Hey!

These ribbons represent important memories to so many people.
Young lady, the skyscraper I'm gonna build here is also important...
Important to my bank account.
- But Dad...

- But...

Yes, sir.

(Mr. Tien) You can either leave quietly, or my new assistant will remove you.
We're not going anywhere.
Fine.
You boys want to be like me someday, huh?
Then show me what you got.
Get them off my property.
Yes, sirree.
Now's our chance.
Show Mr. Tien what we're made of.
Give me that hose.

I don't have time for this nonsense.
Mark my words, this tree is gonna be cut down today.
Enough with the magic tricks.
- Preston, get in the car.

(Mr. Tien) Preston!
How can his dad be so cold?
(Haley) We have to stop him.
But how?
He won't even listen to his own son.
Why would he listen to us?
Tons of people put those ribbons up.
Maybe he'll listen to them.
Yeah, but how are we gonna find them?
I know.

Put them all over town.
Great idea.
You guys go and we'll stay here and start posting online.
Come on, guys.

All right.
(flying noises)
(Cosmo Royale) Please welcome our new contestant, a mastermind of destruction,
Trapsaw!
It's great to be here.
Huh?
Where's the audience?
- Ahem.

Oh, there's everybody!
Hi, Mom!
We know your brother Ripper Rat fought on the show.
Now tell us about you.
Well, I love traps.
- Just step on that "X."

Now, hold very still..
Is something supposed to happen?
Um...
Uh-oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Ahh!

I hate when that happens!
(Cosmo) Ouch!
What a headache.
I hope he's more successful with the Rangers.
That contestant seems like a dunce.
Oh, don't worry, champ.
He just needs to work out the kinks.
You better be right, Ripcon!
(grunting)
For your sake...
Tell him I don't want excuses.
I want it done, period.
This little stunt you and your friends are pulling is costing me a lot of money.
Dad, I think that the tree is important.
Trees are cut down every day.
Where do you think firewood comes from?
I'm just glad your mother's not around to see this.
She helped me build this business and I'm not about to let a bunch of teenagers shut me down.
Son...
I need you to get your friends out of that tree.
Understood?
Understood?
Okay, Dad.
I'll tell them.
See you at the ribbon tree.

There's a restaurant just ahead.
It'll be a great place to put up our flyers.
What?
Where's the restaurant?
I don't know, Levi.
The building looks like it's been here a pretty long time.
No way.
This was a restaurant.
I came here on my last tour.

Maybe your memory's getting a little rusty, huh?
Come on, we got a lot of flyers to put up.
I swear, it was right here.
This ought to bring people out.
Thanks.

He's walking right into my trap.
What?

Hey!
Get back here!
Whoa!

I messed it up again!
Huh?
Was that some kind of trap?
Obviously, my name is Trapsaw!
(Ripcon) You're making me look bad, you fool!
Now go deal with the rest of the Rangers.
Yes, sir.
I'll come up with another brilliant trap.
(laughing)
It's finally time for me to finish you myself.
(Ripcon grunting)
It's finally time for me to finish you myself.
I should have done this ten years ago.
You may have beaten me when I was only eight, but now, you don't stand a chance.
Ninja spin!
Hyah!

Remember when I cut off your horn!

I've only gotten better since then!

Gahh!
Got him!
Ha!
Yes, you have grown stronger...
But not strong enough!
You'll never beat me!

Say goodbye, rat bait, or beg me for mercy.
It's your choice.
I'll never beg.
Then you will be destroyed.
(grunting)
Double Sword Dome Strike!
Steel Slash!
Ninja Spin!
(grunting througout)
Ripcon's tougher than I thought.
I'll need to train more before I can take him on again.
I gotta tell the others about that monster.
(grunting)
Darn it!

Arrgh!
(Haley) Cool, let's jump down.
(Sarah) Where is everybody?
No one showed up?
- Nope.

We put up a couple hundred flyers.
Hey, guys?
I just ran into Ripcon.
Oh, no!

Yeah, but we have to be careful.
He sent a monster.
Just what we need right now.
Uh...

Uh, yeah, lots of them, but no luck yet.
(Calvin) How'd it go with your dad?
Um...
Acutally, we should just give up on the tree.
Preston, that's your dad talking, not you.
Maybe.
But my dad's never gonna change his mind.
The only person he ever listened to was... my mom.
I can't believe he doesn't understand what makes this tree so special.

Well, others do.
(crowd chanting) Save our tree!
Save our tree!

So, you found some other troublemakers.
I don't care.
This tree is still coming down.
(crowd shouting)
I'm very disappointed, Preston.
Your friends will have to learn their lesson the hard way.
Cut it down!
(shouting continues)
But, Boss, look at all these people.
Maybe those kids are right.
Give me that saw!
- I'll cut it down myself.

Dad, you can't do this!
Preston, get out of my way this instant.
No, Dad, I won't.
All these people came here because the tree isn't just a part of the city, it's a part of their lives.
Look at all of them, Dad.
This is absurd.
If it isn't me, it's gonna be someone else who chops it down.
That's progress, son.
- You can't save every tree.

But we have to save this tree.
"January 3rd.
"Marcus and Ellen Tien love their new son.
- Preston."

That's you and Mom.
Oh, my...
I'd forgotten.
We tied this ribbon on the way home from the hospital, after you were born.
I must have buried a lot of memories when we...
When we lost your mom.
I should have listened to you, son.
You have so much of your mom in you.
I've always admired that.
I love you, son.
I love you too, Dad.

I set a trap nearby but nobody's falling into it!
It's got something to do with this stupid tree.
Maybe I'll just cut it down.
You better not touch a single leaf on this tree.
Maybe I'll cut you down, too!

If people won't fall into my trap because of this stupid tree,
I'll just have to cut it down!
You better not touch a single leaf on this tree.
Maybe I'll cut you down, too!
