Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...
The Evil Queen sent everyone from the Enchanted Forest here.
That's what you're going with?
It's true.
You're gonna bring back the happy endings.
I do hope you like apples.
You may not believe in the curse, but I believe in you.
Goodbye, Emma.
I should've believed you.
[Gasps]
[Growls]
[Grunts]
I love you, Henry.
This might be the most important mission yet...
Operation Best Man.
- _ - [Panting]
[Suspenseful music plays]
[Growling, roaring in distance]
What is it, Father?
I'll stay behind, give you time to escape.
You have to make sure it stays safe.
You have it, don't you?
Of course.
It never leaves my side.
[Sighing] Oh, good.
It may be the realm's only hope of defeating the darkness.
I will guard it with my life.
You need to get to safety.
You need to share these stories.
But who will believe them?
Someday... someone will.
[Pounding on door]
Daddy!
I...
Me too.
[Growling]
[Wind whistling]
It's here!
Where do you think it's taking us?
Doesn't matter.
Wherever we end up, we're gonna win.
[Wind intensifies]
[Birds chirping]
[Car horn honks]
[Siren walls in distance]
[Dog barks in distance]
What did the Black Fairy's curse do?
Really, Henry?
Henry, I-I-I thought we were past all this.
She's done something to you, to... to everyone.
Henry, um... do I need to schedule another appointment?
Henry... you know exactly where Emma is.
She's in the same place that she's been for the last two years.
Emma?
You have a visitor.
Your son.
Mom.
Henry.
Thank God you remember me.
Of course I remember you.
Good, 'cause I just looked all over town, and I couldn't find the rest of our family...
Snow, David, Hook.
I'm not going down that road again.
I've worked way too hard for you to undo my progress.
Progress?
You know what I mean.
Those people...
Snow White, Prince Charming, Captain Hook... none of them are real.
My parents are not fairy-tale characters.
This is just a regular town.
Mom... what happened to you?
What happened to me is I'm getting better.
I ended up in this nuthouse because I believed you back then, bought into all of it.
No, this is the Black Fairy.
She said she would take away your family, and this is how.
I just... want to get well so that maybe...
Maybe I can be your mother.
Okay.
How long have you been a patient here?
You know how long I've been here.
Maybe it'll help if you relive it.
[Sighs]
Ever since you tried to prove that fairy tales were real by eating a poisoned apple turnover.
You ended up in the hospital for weeks.
You barely made it through.
No, that's not how it happened.
This is crazy.
You're the one who's supposed to be getting better.
Henry, you were not saved by a kiss.
That's ridiculous.
You were saved by medicine, by Dr. Whale and by... hospital.
It's time.
[Sighs]
Stop it.
It might be how the Black Fairy is keeping you from remembering.
Henry, just let me...
This page I wrote...
It means that the Final Battle is coming.
The key to winning it is in here.
But we can't do that until you start believing.
Sorry about him.
You have to stop doing that, or your mother's not gonna let you keep visiting me.
Who's Regina?
Henry. [Chuckles]
There's my boy.
Hmm.
Madame Mayor, I'm sorry.
I didn't know he was coming today.
How many times have I told you?
It's Fiona.
No need for titles here.
Hmm.
Now, Henry... shouldn't you be at school?
Of course.
I just wanted to see my... other mom.
What's that?
Where did you find that?
Nothing but trouble seems to come from this book.
Hmm.
Now, Henry, back to school.
I'll see you at dinner.
Emma and I have some business to discuss.
Okay, Mom.
Whatever she wants you to do, don't do it.
Now then...
I think somebody needs to take their medicine.
David.
Yeah, I'm okay.
No.
[Sighs] She's gone.
The fairy... she's as good as her word.
She ripped us apart.
This is... our palace.
What now?
We're in the Enchanted Forest.
Well, she has panache, I'll give her that.
She took you from your wedding to theirs.
This is where we got married.
Right before we were cursed.
We'll find him.
If she thinks she can rip this family apart... curses have never stopped us before.
Today will be no different.
We'll get Emma and Henry back.
Wherever they may be.
Uh, all due respect, Emma, but you do seem quite agitated.
Yes, really.
Everything is okay.
Well, I just came to check on your progress.
As mayor of Storybrooke, can you blame me for taking a keen interest in all of our residents?
All of your "troubled" residents.
All due respect, Dr. Hopper and Madame Mayor,
I know exactly what this is really about.
Do you now?
Henry.
Well, you are his biological mother, and he is my son, so perhaps there is a bit more to my interest.
[Chuckles] I don't think that's any secret.
Emma has been doing quite well of late.
Wonderful.
Dr. Hopper's reports are very encouraging.
I don't think I'm talking out of school to say you might be eligible for release soon.
Wouldn't it be nice to paint a different view than these dreary, old hospital grounds?
We are working on the landscaping.
Perhaps even the Boston skyline?
As I recall, you had a lovely apartment overlooking it all.
Wouldn't it be nice to go back?
Good.
Because it's not just your well-being that I'm concerned with.
It's Henry's.
He's clearly still clinging to the delusion that these stories are real.
Now, I'd hoped we were past all that.
But now, thanks to you, I have a 14-year-old boy
I never meant to do any harm.
Of course you didn't.
But as luck would have it, his book has given me an idea of how we could cure him of all of this nonsense.
Burn it.
Show him that you've truly embraced reality and then he will.
Because belief in something, something that isn't real, can be dangerous.
No?
Look, I know all these stories are fake, but I can't destroy this.
I...
I'm not ready for that.
Really?
You might not be ready now, but you will be.
Of that, I am quite certain.
Dr. Hopper will hold onto it until that day comes.
And it will... because, Miss Swan... until you're ready to destroy the book and make a clean break from this fantasy world, you'll remain locked up.
Which she is controlling.
It's the Final Battle.
Well, clearly, it wasn't what we thought it was.
Clearly.
Of course the Final Battle isn't a war.
It's a battle for her soul, for her belief, her hope.
What does she gain if Emma stops believing?
Zelena.
What is she doing here?
Helping, thank you very much.
[Gasps] The Mad Hatter's hat.
W-Wasn't it destroyed?
Inside are portals to every realm.
I used it to escape Oz.
Why did you need to escape your own realm?
Look, there isn't much time.
It's easier if I show you.
[Whooshing]
If you want to know what we were running from... take a gander.
There's nothing there.
I can see that.
When I left Oz, it was falling apart...
Apocalyptic, but now...
What the bloody hell does this got to do with Emma?
This is what she's doing.
It's why she wants Emma to destroy the book.
[Rumbling]
As the Savior's belief fades... so do all the realms of story.
[Rumbling]
[Whoosh]
If we don't stop the Black Fairy... all the realms will be destroyed...
[Brakes squeal, engine shuts off]
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
Who's here, Papa?
[Fiona chuckles]
Just checking everything is as it should be.
[Chuckles]
You know what they say...
A mayor's work is never done.
Madame Mayor... an honor.
[Chuckles]
I brought you lunch, and a little job if you'll take it.
My wristwatch stopped.
Guess I'm not good for timepieces.
We'll figure out that clock tower one day.
Don't worry.
And I'll get working on the watch right away.
Thank you.
Your favorite oatmeal raisin cookies are in there, too.
Oh, thank you.
You're very kind, always thinking of Gideon.
[Inhales deeply]
Well, when someone's lost their mother...
I feel a need to step into that void.
And how are you doing?
I know this time of year can be difficult.
Yes.
It is hard, thinking of Belle on our anniversary... given what happened.
Yes, it's terribly sad.
So sad.
Thank you.
Well, I'll be back for the watch later.
I always know I can count on you.
And please... if there's anything I can do.
After all, for my boys...
I'm always here to help.
I saw someone from Arendelle just now.
They still had snow on their shoulders.
What?
How far is this nightmare spreading?
Jasmine, Aladdin?
It hit Agrabah... whatever it is.
The Black Fairy's doing this all the way from Storybrooke.
She's attacking Emma's belief.
The more she loses faith, the realms of story fade away.
We need to get back there and stop all this.
What about the portal we just came through, the hat?
It can't make a passage to a land without magic.
We need something else.
I have it.
I mean, I think I have it.
I might have a theory where to look.
Well, all due respect, Captain, but what we need right now is magic.
And that's my area.
It's time I get to work and do what I do best.
We need to get out of this hat and back to my castle.
[All murmuring]
I don't care what kind of magic it takes,
I'm getting Henry and Emma back.
[Breathing deeply]
- [Grunts] - [Buzzer]
Henry?
Dr. Hopper really needs to keep an eye on his wallet.
You don't belong here.
And no matter what the mayor says, she's never letting you out.
But I am.
Welcome to Operation Cuckoo's Nest.
I haven't seen the movie in a long time, but didn't that end with a lobotomy?
Just...
We have to get out of here before the nurse comes back.
Come on!
Bloody hell.
It's taller than I remembered.
Hey!
Next time you sneak off on a secret mission, you might want to make sure there's no Munchkins around.
They're easily bought.
Honestly, stealth wasn't a priority...
Speed was.
So this is your theory on how to get home, huh?
Hoping there's a magic bean up there?
There's only one way to find out.
[Sighs]
Hook, that beanstalk's over 1,000 feet high.
You really think you can climb that alone?
I think I want to get back to my wife.
But making her a widow is not what I'd call a good plan.
You're gonna get yourself killed.
I'll have you know I've scaled this before.
With Emma.
It was our first adventure together, though my motives were less than chivalrous then.
Yeah, I seem to recall you trying to kill her and Snow.
Granted, it was hardly love at first sight.
But... things changed.
Emma and I were never a predestined love story, guaranteed a happy ending.
We fought for our love, and we won.
And you...
You of all people should understand that.
But now... you saw into that mirror.
She doesn't even remember who I am.
So, yes,
I'm gonna climb this beanstalk, and I am gonna find that bean... because I'm not gonna lose everything I have just because some bitter fairy cast another bloody curse!
Our story began on the beanstalk, and I'll be damned if it ends there, too.
All right.
Just [sighs] take a deep breath.
All right, calm down.
Let's go get that bean together.
Okay, well, unless we're waiting for a helicopter,
I think we went the wrong way.
We're here because this is the last place you saw your family.
The last place you remembered who you really are...
The Savior.
Henry, you have to accept these things are not real.
And bringing me to some rooftop is not gonna convince me that my mother is Snow White.
But she is.
And this isn't just some rooftop.
This is where you married your true love yesterday.
That's not the way the world works.
It does, and it did for you.
You married Captain Hook right here.
The aisle was right here... where your parents gave you away.
The only time they gave me away was when I was a baby.
Mom, stop it.
They walked you to the altar.
That's where you exchanged vows, in front of all your friends and family who love you.
I don't know.
Henry, I don't know what I saw.
I've been in a mental hospital for years.
It's not like my brain is really trustworthy right now.
I don't want to fight.
I want to go home to Boston.
Storybrooke is your home.
But, Henry, you're right.
If I stay here, Fiona's just gonna lock me up again.
And that's not good for me or you.
Y-You can't leave.
It's not for forever.
I'll come back, I promise.
But you got to wait.
You'll be safer if you leave after dark.
I know where Dr. Hopper keeps your car keys.
A few seconds ago, you were trying to keep me here.
Now you're gonna help me leave?
You're my mom.
I'll always want to help you.
And you're right.
You don't deserve to be locked up again.
Thanks, kid.
Meet me back in an hour, and after that,
I promise you'll have the life you always wanted.
Belle: "To my son, Gideon.
Remember to be strong and true.
I will always love you.
Mother."
Gideon...
I know it's not easy to talk about Belle.
But this book... meant the world to her, and she really wanted you to have it.
I know.
So I would always remember how much she loved me.
Yeah.
How much do you remember?
A-About when she left?
She said she was going to the store, and she never came back.
Yeah, well, you know, I-I-I've been thinking, and, um... well, maybe we don't know the whole story.
Your mother wouldn't just leave... not without good reason.
Will you stop with this?
She walked out on us.
Don't try to rationalize it away.
She didn't love us.
[Sighs] No.
No, I-I-I can't accept that. [Stammers]
She would never do that.
But she did.
And you know what?
We don't need her to have a happy life.
We have everything we need right here in this shop.
You just... you refuse to see it.
Your mother loved you, Gideon.
And no matter what may have happened between us... she would always want to be a part of your life.
Please, just... leave it alone.
Gideon.
[Bubbling]
Lizard horn?
How is that possible?
I had tons of it.
It's all gone.
All my things are gone!
Somebody's stolen from me!
Well, it can't be any of the new people.
[Footsteps approaching]
Oh, goody.
I think we're about to find out.
I am so going to enjoy this.
Regina?
You're back.
I-I'm back?
You're back.
Well, this is disappointing.
So, you're the one who's been squatting in my castle?
I'm not "squatting" anywhere.
This is the Evil Queen's castle, after all.
Nice outfit, by the way.
We really do make it look good, don't we?
Thanks.
I-I mean [scoffs] w-what are you doing here?
I thought you were in that Wish Realm with Robin.
Well, I was.
But there was one little thing you neglected to mention before sending me off to my fabulous new home.
Everyone there thinks I murdered Snow and Charming.
And my own son was trying to kill me.
So, after three days of angry villagers trying to burn my home,
I decided to find a new place to live.
Did you murder him, too?
Of course not.
He's out with Friar Tuck.
And I don't murder anymore, Zelena.
Robin and I have turned over a new leaf.
We now steal from the rich and give to the poor.
Well, mostly anyway.
Sounds delightful.
Look, can we get back to saving the world now?
You know, while there's still one to save.
Yes, um... w-we're having a bit of a... fairy problem.
Oh.
Do tell.
[Cellphone rings]
[Beeps]
Yes?
She did what?
[Door opens]
[Drawer opens]
[Keys thud]
[Drawers open, close]
[Sighs]
[Drawer closes]
Henry.
Oh.
Hey, Mom.
There's no reason to pretend, Henry.
We both know I'm not your mother.
So, you know I'm awake.
I know everything.
What are you gonna do?
Put me in the crazy house, too?
Of course not.
You're much more useful to me out here.
What's that mean... "useful"?
Turns out, getting a Savior to give up her belief is much harder than I thought.
Even if you take everything away from her, which I have, there's still that one last pesky speck of belief that just refuses to die out.
And it never will.
My mom's strong.
She'll fight it, and there's nothing you can do to stop that.
You're right.
There is nothing I can do to stop it.
But there is something you can do.
Madame Mayor, what happened?
There was an accident.
Henry broke into his doctor's office, had a nasty fall down the stairs.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I just don't know how this could be.
They say that he's stable, but it was such a tumble.
Thank you.
But that's not the only reason for your visit, is it?
I know this is poor timing, but there's something I need to discuss with you.
Yes, the timing is poor.
Perhaps we can chat about it later over my infamous black pudding.
Gideon, too, of course.
I need you to reopen the investigation into Belle's disappearance.
Oh.
You and Gideon lead such charmed lives.
Why tear open old wounds?
Well, they never properly healed.
Gideon may hide it well enough, but I know he's... he's hurting inside.
He needs to know the truth.
Belle wouldn't just abandon him for no reason.
Come with me.
Maybe it's up there.
Well, that shouldn't be too difficult.
Apart from the fact that that's way up there, and we're way down here.
What's some oversized furniture?
It's not the furniture I'm worried about.
It's its oversized owners.
I thought the giants were gone.
It appears some have stayed.
Oh, what are we doing?
You can't pull yourself up there.
You don't think I've swung from masts before?
I'm doing this.
She's your daughter, but she's my wife.
Okay, you're right.
I am?
Yeah.
So, you're gonna trust all of our fates to a pirate?
No.
I'm gonna trust my son... in-law.
Thank you.
[Grunts]
Is everything all right up there?
This place is a bloody obstacle course.
[Sniffs]
I think I just might have found something.
[Grunts]
[Glass cracks]
What was that?
Just, uh [sighs] retrieving the [grunts] the bean!
[Shatters]
[Grunts]
[Rumbling]
Bloody hell.
I think I just woke up the giants!
Hook, I think it's worse than giants.
Don't tell me you're afraid of a little fire.
That's not fire.
[Roars]
[Suspenseful music plays]
[Fiona sighs] So, yes.
I haven't been completely honest.
The police did find evidence of what happened to Belle.
I just wanted to save you and Gideon the heartbreak.
[Sighs]
Well... she wanted to see the world.
Just not with you, it would appear.
Look, I must be frank with you, for your sake as well as Gideon's.
You're the one that caused him all this pain, not Belle.
She left because you could never be the man she wanted you to be.
But you can still be the man your son needs you to be... by accepting that and moving on.
Thank you.
This was, uh... illuminating.
[Car door closes]
Oh, Henry.
What do you know?
[ Indistinct talking over P.A.]
[Monitor beeping rhythmically]
Henry!
Mom?
He was trying to steal this.
Then he tried to escape and had a nasty fall.
You lied to me.
You said you were done with all this.
She wants to destroy your belief.
He's confused...
Concussed, according to Dr. Whale.
Look, I pulled this from the security camera.
[Sighs]
Put aside the fact that he's my own son...
How could I push him if I wasn't even touching him?
She used magic.
Kid, there's no such thing as magic.
True belief is believing even if you can't see.
Here, just look at the book.
Henry.
It... it didn't work.
I'm sorry, but you're not a kid anymore.
This isn't some daring rescue operation.
It's real life.
Mom... please.
It was just his arm this time.
Next time, what if it's his neck... or worse?
This is the apple turnover all over again.
He's hurting himself to make you believe his delusions.
Then you know what you have to do.
You just... have to believe in me.
Kid, just 'cause you believe something doesn't make it true.
That's exactly what makes it true.
Deep down, you know that.
What I know, Henry, is that I love you.
And that's why I have to do this.
Mom.
Henry, I'm sorry.
[Dramatic music plays]
[Rumbling]
[Both grunting]
I don't think so.
I think we got a bigger problem than a dragon!
Go on, dear.
Only you can save our son now, Emma.
Go on.
[Thunder rumbles]
I think we may be too late.
Your father wouldn't want you in tears.
Not on his behalf.
Tiger Lily.
What happened here?
Where is Father?
I don't know.
But I do know that it's clear he fought valiantly so you could escape.
I never should've left.
I should've fought with him!
Because you did, the book is safe.
We need to take it to your mother now.
She'll be waiting.
But what about Father?
You'll be reunited one day.
They have?
W-We're going to be okay?
The future is cloudy, but you will be reunited.
After that... you just need to learn the lesson imparted by this book.
Never lose hope.
It... it can't be.
Or what's left of it.
Oh, but she did.
Whatever last bit of belief she clung to went up in smoke, just like the pages of your precious book.
Not even you could destroy her belief completely.
If that's so, then why is she packing for Boston at this very moment?
I'll stop you.
Oh, haven't you already tried that?
Look where it got you.
It's not just me.
It's my family.
We won't let you win.
Oh, haven't I mentioned the consequences of Emma's lost belief?
Your family isn't going to exist long enough to save themselves, let alone your mother.
[Gasps]
[Both grunting]
Hurry, mate!
Yeah, I know!
Aah!
Hook!
Aah!
[Grunting]
Hoooook!
[Tinkling]
Aah!
Charming.
Something's wrong.
I don't know.
Then let's go find him.
[Snaps fingers]
[Man groaning]
David!
Hello there, mummy.
"Mummy?"
And yeah, that is still going to take some getting used to.
[Groans]
Uh, what happened?
Well, first, I fell, and then... and then it fell, but we managed to get this.
Great!
Where's David?
You mean he's not here?
We should start searching.
The realms are disappearing.
We don't have much time.
Get to Emma.
It's important.
Make her believe again.
So it's true.
You're really leaving Storybrooke.
It's what's best for both of us, kid.
Don't you get it?
This is what she wants.
The Black Fairy cast the curse so all this would get you to leave.
This is why I have to go, because you still believe this nonsense is true.
And I'm so happy I got to know my son.
But it's so clear now.
Coming to Storybrooke wasn't good for either of us.
You're wrong.
Look where I ended up.
It sent us on a dangerous path.
I got to get back to Boston and back to my life.
And so do you.
She did it.
You really don't believe?
[Voice breaking] There's nothing to believe.
[Sighs]
Goodbye, kid.
I love you.
_
[Door creaks]
[Keys jingle]
But I know that it is.
And it can still have a happy ending.
[Phone ringing]
[Phone beeps]
Hello?
'Cause I got a guy who jumped bail... a perfect mark for your "first date" trick.
What do you say?
Sounds good.
[Phone beeps]
[Slams phone]
_
_
[Lightning cracks]
And you left Snow behind?
Well, we have a problem.
What the devil happened to it?
It's sapping the magic from everything here.
Of course you do, sis.
With a little help from, well, yourself.
The Evil Queen.
Your evil half is here?
And yes, she's here.
And you trust here?
And remember, Henry's her son, too.
David!
[Earth rumbling]
[Wind howling]
David!
No, no, no!
No, no!
[Whimpers]
Please, no!
No.
You found me.
Did you ever doubt I would?
Truthfully, the beanstalk that fell on me gave me pause.
[Laughs softly]
[Earth rumbling]
Snow, we're gonna be fine.
Darkness never wins.
It just fools you into thinking it does.
I love you, Charming.
I love you, Snow.
Let's go.
[Door bells jingle]
Mr. Gold?
And where do you think you're going to, young man?
That room is off limits to customers.
I'm not a customer.
I'm your grandson.
[Scoffing] Is that so?
Yep.
You must've hit your head pretty badly.
Now, if you don't mind, I got work to do, so... please.
[Potion simmering]
You're awake.
I know what magic looks like.
What are you up to, Grandpa?
Clever under any circumstances, aren't you, my boy?
Why have you been pretending?
Because, believe it or not,
I didn't entirely trust my mother when she cast the curse.
And, as usual, I was right not to.
Our agreement wasn't to put me in this pathetic circumstance here without Belle.
She betrayed me.
Again.
What are you planning?
To find out her true intentions.
She told me Belle was off to see the world, but I know better.
She'd keep her here for leverage, just in case.
Well, Belle's gonna have to wait.
Everyone back in the Enchanted Forest is in danger because the Black Fairy made Emma stop believing.
You got to help me save my family.
Our family.
And then we can find Belle.
I'm sorry, Henry, you're on your own.
All I care about right now is Belle.
Fine.
But if you're not gonna help, at least let me take something that can help me.
And what exactly did you have in mind?
Actually... there's two things.
So, uh, I'm not sure if any of you on the other side are listening, but if you are, I'm sorry.
I tried my best to keep Emma from losing belief, but it wasn't good enough.
[Sniffs]
But that doesn't mean I'm going down without a fight.
If Emma's not around to take on the Black Fairy, then I will.
But how could he win against her if Emma couldn't?
He's a tough boy.
Get that bean working now.
I'm sorry, Regina, but even with our magic combined, it will still take time.
[Lighting crashes]
We don't have time.
It's on the outskirts of the forest and moving fast.
The magic's almost here.
"Almost."
I'm afraid that's a bit of an understatement.
It is here.
Let's round everyone up, get them to safety.
[Lightning crashing]
What the hell are you doing?
I'm going to hold it off as long as I can.
You'll die!
It'll give you a chance to get to the courtyard.
Go to the center of the castle.
You can survive long enough there to get the bean to work.
You just need time.
Let me give that to you.
Regina.
Go.
He's my son, too.
He needs at least one of us.
Everyone, to the center, quickly!
Close together!
[Rumbling]
[Baby crying]
Not so fast.
You came back.
Does that mean you... you remember?
I... found the book you left.
I was about to take another job and... and then I thought about this woman you wrote about who was a hero with a family and a Savior who never ran from a battle and...
You.
Well, I'm not sure that it's me, Henry, but, um... but it's who I want to be.
So I don't remember all the crazy stuff you told me, but...
I believe it.
[Lightning crackling]
[Crackling stops]
[Baby fusses]
What happened?
Belle?
Belle?
Please!
[Door locks]
Belle.
How do you know my name?
I can explain if you give me a chance.
Belle, I know this is difficult to understand... but... you're not like this.
The Black Fairy did this to you.
Changed you.
I promise you, the woman who did this,
I am gonna make her pay.
[Door bells jingling]
Are you here to pick up your watch?
No, I'm not here for my watch.
I'm here because Emma Swan is back.
Are you all right?
Do you need something?
Indeed I do.
There's a Fairy wand in this shop.
My Fairy wand.
And I need it back now.
A Fairy wand?
Perhaps I should call my father.
He'll know what to do.
The last thing I need is Gold getting involved.
Why did I do that?
I didn't want to do that.
Despite what your father thinks, I still have your heart.
You have to do whatever I say.
So start looking for that wand now.
What is that?
The runes that Henry scribbled.
It's an ancient language long lost to time.
I need the wand to translate it.
It holds the key to winning the Final Battle.
Is... this what you were looking for?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
It's been centuries since I felt its power.
[Inhales deeply]
[Exhales sharply]
Wonderful.
Time to go to work, Gideon.
[Door bells jingling]
Ah.
[Door bells jingling]
Hello, Mr. Gold.
I was just here to pick up my watch.
No, you weren't...
Mother.
Of course.
You know, I only separated you from Belle for your own good.
She's my wife.
And a terrible one.
She would convince you to go against your dark instincts.
I couldn't let that happen.
But once the Final Battle is won, the curse on Belle and Gideon will be lifted, and I will have unchecked powers.
Not even the laws of magic will apply.
I can make them love you without you having to give up being the Dark One.
Don't you realize?
You can finally have it all.
No...
I can't.
I won't trust you.
All you care about's yourself.
And I worked tirelessly to reunite us!
And now we can be a family again.
And not just with Belle and Gideon.
What do you mean by that?
With my new powers, I can bring back the dead.
Like Baelfire.
Your first son that you lost.
All your desires can be had.
Your magic will really allow us to have it all?
[Laughs softly]
Without a doubt.
Well, there's just one problem.
All magic comes with a price.
[Gasps]
And I'm no longer willing to pay it.
You will not be winning any battle.
And you are gonna suffer for what you did to Belle and Gideon.
[Chokes] You may think that you can stop me, but that doesn't mean the Final Battle is over.
After all, I'm not the one who's going to kill the Savior.
That's what I learned from the runes.
Darkness can't snuff out the light.
It's not strong enough.
Only light can snuff out light.
Gideon.
You have his heart.
Yes.
And I commanded him to kill the Savior.
Not even my death can stop that.
In fact, I suspect it would ensure it.
Well... there's only one way to find out.
[Gagging]
[Wind howling]
[Wand clatters]
[Pulse rippling]
I remember.
Just in time, Savior.
[Door closes, bells jingle]
Belle.
The curse is broken.
When I killed her.
You killed your mother?
W-Where's Gideon?
I don't know.
Still under her control.
But I think I know who to ask.
Henry.
C-Can you stop him?
I don't intend to stop him.
[Cell phone beeps]
I intend to save him.
Gideon.
You don't want to do this.
You can't win.
[Thunk]
[Pulse crashes]
[Pulse crashes]
I appreciate your optimism, kid, but we got to go.
You think his heart's down here?
I know my mother.
This is where she'd hide it.
Belle, you all right?
Can you see him?
I'm so sorry that I ever doubted you.
I'm just happy it's broken.
Oh, Dad.
Some honeymoon, huh?
Okay.
[Lid creaks]
Kill you no matter what.
Well, then we'll kill him.
If Gideon kills Emma, then light will be destroyed.
And if Emma kills him, then she'll darken herself and light will be destroyed anyway.
You don't have to kill him.
Just hold him off until Gold gets his heart.
Well, there's no holding him off.
But she is right.
It's a trap, and it's perfect.
No matter what, darkness wins.
Emma, you of all people should know, there's always a third way.
[Sighs]
Remember when you first came to Storybrooke?
We hated each other.
I was Henry's mother, but you said you were.
And we fought.
And oh, boy, did we ever fight.
But you found a third way.
We were both his mother.
Earlier today, I saw my evil half... be selfless.
Just like however you're going to get out of this, you haven't seen yet.
But you will.
Sounds like you're talking about hope.
Something you taught me all those years ago when... you didn't give up on me.
What should I do?
You'll know when the time comes.
[Whoosh]
I'm afraid that time has indeed come.
I got this.
Let her go.
[Heartbeat thumping]
There's your heart, Gideon.
Now, remember what Mother said.
"With the death of the Savior, you can have it all."
You're nothing but a devil on my shoulder.
Doesn't mean to say I'm wrong, dearie.
This is our last chance to finally get everything.
Love and power.
All you have to do now is put the heart down and let our boy finish his mission.
No.
I won't betray my family.
I will do the right thing.
I was destined to become the Savior.
[Chuckles] And now you're fated to change magic!
In this new world, we will make the rules.
Belle wants to see the world.
No.
It won't... be... real.
Gideon, stop.
Do not kill Emma Swan.
[Heart thumping]
[Thumping stops]
[Chuckles]
Did you really think it was gonna be that easy?
This is the Black Fairy's spell we're talking about here!
You may want to do the right thing, but as we all know, we can't always get what we want.
[Chuckling] Now, can we?
No one's going to save you.
[Grunts]
I'm fighting for the people I love.
Ultimately, I am a hero.
And light cannot destroy darkness.
It can only create more light.
I will not kill innocents!
I will do what all saviors must!
I will give hope...
[Groans]
[Panting]
[Gasps]
no matter what the cost.
No!
I'm sorry, Emma.
I was hoping you'd save us both.
[Gasps]
[Winds howling, sky crackling]
I failed you, Belle.
I failed our family.
I made the right choice.
It just didn't work out.
Hey.
I love you.
[Gasps]
I love you, too.
I love you, too!
[Baby cooing]
[Exhales sharply]
Is that...
It's Gideon.
A fresh start.
A happy ending.
No.
A happy beginning.
Henry!
I think this belongs to you.
"When Good and Evil both did the right thing, faith was restored.
The final battle was won."
[Laughs softly]
That's it.
No.
I mean, maybe of this book, but... it isn't the end, end.
So... what now?
Believing in even the possibility of a happy ending is a powerful thing, but living with that kind of belief... that's the most powerful thing of all.
That's hope.
So you asked, "What now?"
Now we get to keep going on.
We get to keep doing what we love... with the people we love.
An ending isn't happiness.
Being together is.
Hmm?
[Tinkling]
_
[Bird chirping]
[Air whistling]
Ready for a new adventure?
["Beauty and the Beast" theme plays]
_
[Exhales sharply]
[Door unlocks]
Uh... hello?
Yeah.
I don't have a daughter.
Yeah, you do.
