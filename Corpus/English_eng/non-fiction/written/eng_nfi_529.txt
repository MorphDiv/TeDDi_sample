Previously on "The Mist"...
I cannot do what you ask of me.
I can.
You must repent.
No!

Let me help you die.
I will put a bullet in whatever body part you touch her with.
- Understood?

What's going on?
I can't find a solution without... experiments.
Get Kevin!
Let's go!
And where the hell are we going?
The only place the doors will stay shut.
- Where?

- Open up!

Anybody in there?

- Come on!

- Help!

- Who is it?

How do I know that you're not part of that thing out there?
Look, II'm Anna Lambert's daughter.
She was here.
Please!

Come on.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
You can't be too careful.
Thank you.
Yeah, come on in.
- Sit him down...

Crazy doctor drugged him.
Yeah, welcome to my world.
We can't stay here.

Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, no, no, you don't look like someone who... who should be traveling right now.
He's right.

Yeah, well, there's not a lot of people left around here.
TThere's rooms down the hallway.
Beds are already made.
Help yourself.
Hey, um, and II'm so sorry, about your mom.
She wasn't like the rest of them.
Nothing bad in her.
Thanks.
Wait.
Thought you wanted to be alone.
What do you mean?
You took off.
Well, if you let me, I can...

No touching.
That's a shame.

Save your bullets.

And if they're not, he's a bigger psychopath than we thought, so I guess we'll have to find out.
Do they work?
The fancy ones didn't, but the simple battery ones do.
Well, here's to simple things.
Gus?
Gus, are you in there?
Hold on a sec.
Come in.
We have a bit of a situation downstairs.
- Hey!

Hey!
What the hell is going on?
He tried to skip the rations and just eat whatever he wanted.
You out of your mind?
We've got two days worth of rations left.
Wasn't me.

I'm starving, man.
We all are.
All we got is biscuits and tea left.
I'm not the fucking Queen of England.
And you saw the pamphlets.

But we don't know when, and we don't know how large an area they spread the fliers over.
What do you want?
Just seeing if I could borrow some of your board games.
- You don't have any business here.

Fine.
I love that song.
Me, too.

My father would beat my mother.
My sister would bring my brother and me into her room, and she'd play it, turn it up as loud as she could.
I hate that song.
My wife loved it.
Okay.
- All done for now.

You must of get a lot of that here, Father?
Excuse me?
I said you must get a lot of that here, men beating women, absolving them of their sins.
Sins are unfortunately a part of being human.
It's horrible, watching a man beat a woman.
Nothing worse.
I've been a cop for over 15 years.
It's about the only thing I'm good at, like knowing when people are hiding things.
You haven't touched your food.
So?
Guilt's a real appetite killer.
So is fear.
There is something worse than men beating women.
It's when a man is such a coward that he has someone else do it for him.
Chief Heisel, in your experience, do priests often beat older ladies?
No... but they know how to manipulate altar boys.
Mr. Heisel...
Do you have something to confess?
No!
Stop it!

Nobody's gonna help you.
Look, your name isn't Bryan Hunt.
It's Jonah Dixon.
You beat up a solider called Bryan Hunt up at Arrowhead.
You stole his clothes.
I met Bryan, and that's why I took off.
Now, either you really do have memory loss, or you're a psycho.
Which is it?
I...

I swear.
Didn't know what?
My name.
I met him after you left.
He tried to kill me.
I'm Jonah?
You're Jonah.
Where'd you go?
I...
I went to my mother's house, wanted to run away.
And my mom was there.
Or you know.
And she wanted to help me die, and I didn't want to, and I was so surprised that I didn't, 'cause I have nothing to live for.
Except...
Except maybe... maybe I do.
I believe you, and...
I want to be someone you can believe in.
But to be that, I need your help.
Okay.
I'm gonna do rapid detox.
I take opiate blockers, and they'll work in my body for five, six hours, and when I'm done, I'll be clean.
And what I need you to do is tie me up and not let me out.
Why?
'Cause it's usually done under general anesthesia, for good reason.
Jonah... please.
Where are we going?
A room far away.
There'll be lots of screaming.
Help must be on the way.
Yeah, but we only have two days of food left.
Don't.
- You can't trust him.

You're 16.

What are your qualifications, then?
What do you mean?
For knowing whom I should trust.
I'm your mom.
That's my qualification, and I will kick him out of the loading dock.
They might be crazy out there, but he'll be safe.
- Okay.

I mean, if it's safe, then I'm sure you don't mind if I crash out there, if I go with him.
Not a chance in hell.
Then I guess he stays.
I can't sleep.
Yeah, me neither.
What's the worst thing you've ever done to somebody?
There was a kid.
Everyone...

I'd see him at school, swishing around like a little faggot.
The way he looked at you, it made me sick.
Knew for weeks I wanted to hurt him.
Then one day after practice... he smiled at me.
And then what happened?
I beat him up.
Took his arm, put it behind his back, and broke it.
I wanted him to beg me to stop, but he didn't.
I, um...
I took my dick out.
I asked him, "Was this what you want?"
And I pissed on him.
He never told anyone.
I respected that.
I'm sorry.
II'm so sorry.
I forgive you.
My God.
You okay?
Yeah, just make them tighter.
Make them tighter.
Look, no matter what happens, you don't let me out of these things, okay, no matter how bad it gets.
Thank you.

I wanted to thank you, Link.
I want to thank you for your sacrifice.
I want you to know it will not be in vain.
I want you to know that your faith in me continues to inspire me, even after you're gone.
It's because of that that I now know what I must do.
And I wanted to thank you for that.
Goodbye, Link.
May I sit?
What are you reading?
The Bible.
I was curious.

Lots of loose ends.
Do you really believe in all this?
Fallen angels?
Resurrection?
Yes.
And you think I'm crazy?
I think you're trying to help these people, but you're leading them astray.
Do you realize you have the destiny of their souls in your hands now?
If I believed in souls, I would worry about yours.
I deserve that.
I knew what Link was going to do, and I allowed it.
I have prayed for forgiveness.
I don't know if I will get it.
All I know is that I did it to save the people here.
And if I don't continue to try,
I have no reason to be alive.
More violence, Father?
Do you know what a trial by ordeal is?
Tell me.
It is a test of life and death, where the proof of innocence is survival.
What kind of test would that be?
We walk into the mist, you and I.
I believe God will spare me, as I am sure you believe Nature will spare you.
Whoever dies, we will provide an answer for the people here.
They will know who to follow.
I'm willing to risk my life to give them that answer.
Are you?
Hey.

Hey, hey.
Have you seen Adrian?
No.

Well, it's just, um...

He's probably in the bathroom.
Yeah, ddon't... don't waste your time looking for him.
What do you mean?
He... he's not a good person.
Yeah, I...

Just like I saw the... the girl's mom, Mrs. Lambert, and... and I knew she was...

Come on.
- Adrian?

- Adrian.

- Adrian!

See... see, I...

I...

You know, he... he... he's dead now, and it is so clear.
They all had evil in them.
Where is Adrian?
Yeah, I'm...

Hey!

Come on!
Come on!

Let us in!
I can't do it.

Please.
Please.
Please.

Please.
Please, please, let me go.
You told me not to.
Please.

Well, I change my mind.
Please.

Jonah, please.
I'm sorry.
Get me the fuck out of here!

I...

Bryan told me everything.
I know where you're from.
I...

Jonah?
Jonah!

You're lying.
No, I'm...

I...

I'm not.
If you know something, tell me.
When you release me, I'll tell you.
- You don't know anything.

Please, no!
Jonah.
Jonah!
Jonah.
Jonah!
I remember something.
Shelley, please.
You should hear this.
You don't know them.
You didn't stay with them.

Eve could be lying as well.
That doesn't mean they've been hoarding.
They've had plenty of time to gather food.
For all we know, they could have raided the stores
- before we started looking.

I know that she came and asked for board games, and if that's her major concern, then it's because she isn't worried about food.
If they have more food, they should share it with us.
- I can ask if...

You may not like them, but there's no reason...
You didn't hear what I heard.
They're liars, both of them.
I'm sorry about what happened to you, but if you can't behave, then just shut your mouth.
It's very simple.
You didn't have to do that.
Nine meals from anarchy.
What?
There's this theory that we're always just nine meals from anarchy.
Take away food, take away water, nine missing meals later, that's when people start doing bad things.
Hey.
You're not alone, okay?
Nathalie, I can't let you do this.
You don't have a choice.
Father Romanov and I decided together.
What if you're both wrong?
- What if it's...

But if one of us is right, if one of us survives, then you will know who to follow.
Then that person can save you.
I would like a few moments alone so I can pray.
Then we should begin.
I believe in you.
In the name of the Father, of the son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen.
Be with me now, in this hour of need, I pray to you.
In the name of the Father, of the son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen.
Mrs. Raven?
Mrs. Raven, are you ready?
Maybe the Lord has changed her mind.
By the divine power of God, cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits... who roam throughout the world seeking the ruin of...
You gotta let us in.

Yeah, there... there's no stronger door in the psych ward than the one that guards their precious medicine.
Come on!

Hey, what's your name?
What's your name?
Just tell me your name.
- Nash.

You gotta let him go.
We'll take him out of here.

- I don't know.

- I can't let you do that.

I know him.

No, look, this... this is not how this works, okay?
The kid has to die.
I remember it now.
Bird.
I'm in so much pain.
They kept me locked up.
A woman...

Smile.
Please.
She... she started saying words to me.
Bike.
Random words.
Lamp.
I don't know why, but the words... the words would take me through the pain.
Listen to me!
Listen.

When she spoke,
I would feel the word instead of the pain.
Table.
Orange.
Pen.
And I got through it.
Pearl.
Stoplight.
So will you.
Feline.
Just listen to me
- I can't...

Mist.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
What happened out there?
We couldn't see you.
Nothing happened.
I just stood there with my eyes closed.
And everything happened.
I could hear him die, and he was in so much pain.
But out there in the mist, it all sounds different, and it was beautiful.
And it was like the sound of a strange bird or a glacier breaking.
I felt it all.
I felt Nature take Romanov, just like she took Link and Mikhail.
I felt her sensing me.
She knows I'm not a threat.
She knows I am her messenger.
Please!
No!

Nash, how does it work?
How does it work?
Tell me, how does it work?
Well, it... it... it travels, okay?
It...

And this is my fault.
Why?

Tell me why it's your fault.
The...

The...

She asked me to beat it out of her, and I did... and I let it out.
I let it out.
Listen to me.

It is not in him.
- It is not inside Adrian.

I did.
I have to fight it.
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

He's not evil!

Nash, I can prove it.

How?
Because I am.
You're lying.
I'm not.
Then prove it.
Let me in, and I will.
Yeah.

You try and trick me.
Look me in the eye.
Look me in the eye, Nash!
Look me in the eye, and tell me you don't see evil.
I don't believe you.
All right, then, do it.
Do it!
Hurt him.
He's weak.

Yeah?
What else?
What else do you want?
I want to find the boy who raped my daughter.
And what will you do to him?
I want to...

I want...

And then what?
I want to reach into his stomach and pull out his intestines.
I want him to try to scream, but he can't make a sound.
And I won't stop.
And I want him to be in pain forever.
I want him to suffer, to regret... to beg.
I want him to beg me.
And then I want him to learn that there will be no salvation.
And I want to look him in the eye when he realizes that.
Okay.

It's all right.
I got you.
Come on.
You need a shower.

Fuck you.
All right, you... you walk in.

Let him go.
We don't have to do this.
What else is there to do than to fight the evil?
What else is there in life?
It's in you.
It's really in you.
I'm gonna go find Bryan and Mia, and then we're getting out of here.
You got a plan, Chief?
Didn't think so.
Looks like we're gonna die here.
Kyle, please.
What are you gonna say?
That we got a couple days' food left?
Who cares if it's two or three days?
It doesn't matter.
What if there's a reason the mist is here?
Don't you think it's strange?
Everyone who's gone into the mist has died, except her, except Alex.
The mist didn't want her.
Shelley, we talked about this.
Something's wrong with them.
When did all this start?
It started when she lied, when she lied about being raped.
I think we all need to calm down, get some sleep.
I think we need to find a solution.
Unless you all want to die here.
You okay?
Are you?
Do you know what I thought of in there?
I had never held a guy's hand.
I always wanted to... but you know how people are.
I thought he was gonna kill me, so I promised myself, if I survived, I would do that.
I would hold a guy's hand.
I would hold it... walk down the street, and not give a shit about what anybody thought.
Who cares, right?
Hey.
You guys coming?
I, um...

- What?

I could go back to, um, normal.
Adrian, come on.
Adrian, let's go.
You sure?
Tyler, last chance.
