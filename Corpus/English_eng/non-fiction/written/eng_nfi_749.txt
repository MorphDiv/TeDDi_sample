Gordon:

- An Extra Serving."

- We're taking a trip...

down memory lane.
We'll take a look back at some of our greatest hits...
- Eww!

Duh... and messiest bits from the last five seasons.
Plus, we'll visit some of our past junior home cooks...
- Now I'm a teenager.

Who aren't so junior anymore.
Now I'm able to drive, which is crazy.
This is "MasterChef Junior:

Hello.

"MasterChef" is officially the world's biggest cooking competition.
It began 27 years ago, and it's been seen in 58 different countries.
But there's one "MasterChef" that really has taken the world by storm.
In 2013, somebody thought it might be interesting to put me in the kitchen with kids.
I thought, "They're out of their minds,"
and then, this happened.
- Whoa.

My kitchen back home is nothing compared to the MasterChef Junior kitchen.
My kitchen is probably, like, five feet.
- Awesome.

MasterChef kitchen is probably, like, the biggest kitchen in the whole world.
It's big.

Can someone reach the pineapple?
Avani:

Gordon:

Oh, my God.

- Oh, why am I so short?

Where's Riley?
Put one finger up if that's Riley behind the box.
Okay.
- Let's go.

Some of the equipment is bigger than me.
Girl:

Jack, can you manage?

I think this is gonna be a big issue for me.
I'm gonna get really strong.
We may be tiny, but we're as strong as the Hulk.
Come on, Eddie.

Gigantic mixer coming through.
- This isn't heavy.

- Graham:

- Do you ever get to dunk the ball?

- No?

- You know what you can do?

- You can make pasta really good.

- This looks great.

Gordon:

- It's delicious.

Can I be honest?

- Thank you.

- Pow.

- but you've got big, big potential.

- Great job.

- Oh!

"MasterChef Junior" was born in 2013, so, as you can imagine, the kids from that first season aren't quite so little anymore.
If you're as intrigued as I am to see what they look like now, then this should do the trick.
I'm Nathan.

all:

I was 8 then, now I'm 12.
When I was eight, I could barely lift that mixer.
- How's he gonna get it on the bench?

- Pretty good job.

Now I'm in middle school and have a girlfriend.
Hey, everyone, it's Dara from season one of "MasterChef Junior."
I was 12 on the show, and I'm 16 now.
You may recognize me as Dara, the bow girl, because of the big bow I wore on my season.
- Dara?

Do I want to be a chef?

I feel really good about this dish.
Hey, guys, it's Kaylen from season one of "MasterChef Junior."
I've just been learning new techniques and cool little tips when I'm cooking.
I just don't want to stop being a chef.
I'm Jewels.

I'm in high school now and I'm studying for my SATs and working really hard on that.
One of the best parts about being on "MasterChef Junior"
were the friends that I've made, and I wouldn't trade them for anything in the world.
- You are definitely a chef in the making, aren't you?

Hi, I'm Alexander, the winner of "Masterchef Junior" season one, and right now I'm in my junior year of high school.
Since being on the show, I've had the opportunity to work in high-end restaurants in New York City and to travel all over the world.
You may want to stand back.
Of course I still want to be a chef later in life after I go through culinary school and hopefully have a restaurant one day.
- That's the big dream.

I love it.

Both:

Talented kids who aren't kids anymore.
From the very first season of this show, the small, talented home cooks have made me laugh every single day.
They say what they like when they like, and the best thing is, they always tell the truth.
Tonight, voices may be raised, egos may be bruised.
But, it's all in the pursuit of what?
Making you look good.
Perfection.

Smash those beans like your life depends on it 'cause it does!
- Yeah!

Quick.

Are you serious with me?
Beet and radishes, come to papa.
Michelle Obama wants me to cook vegetables.

I'm a city kid, so I don't want to lift up a chicken.
What is inside the sausage?
It's cooked meat that is not raw.
Graham:

- That's how you would sell it on the menu?

Ian:

My whipped cream turned out bad.

Great way of selling the dish.
Who makes the best chefs?

- Girls.

Even in the olden days, they were cooking and men were just sitting there watching TV, no offense to you.
No offense to me?

- Yes.

I want show you guys that I'm not just a one-legged pony.
I can do...

Is that the same as a one-trick pony?
Yes.
Where's my basket?
Jack:

This challenge is gonna be chaos.

Abby:

I don't really have a strategy.
Chaos.

- Are you gonna nail this?

Good luck.
Um, can you move?

Wow.
Well, at least Abby was honest.
Still to come on this extra serving of "MasterChef Junior,"
some blooper treats you've never seen before, and some of my favorite moments from the last five seasons.
But before that, something that never gets old.
Fourth graders pouring cream over my head.
This is way back from season one.
- Ready, Joe?

Oh!
Oh, well.
- You do yoga?

- Yeah, downward dog.

- So this is downward dog, like this.

- This is downward dog, see?

This is downward dog, and then we'll go into?
- Plank.

And moving one foot forward.
Joe, don't throw out a hip.
Oh, my God!
- Are you okay?

Medic!

There are plenty more moments like that to come.
Whatever season it is, one thing every kid has in common when they walk into the kitchen is that they love to cook.
And their knowledge, technique, and expertise is way beyond their years.
Ha!
Aar√≥n:

The best talented 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13-year-olds in the country.
Every year, they're just getting stronger and better and better and better.
They're just incredible.
These young home cooks make our mouths water with the promise of amazing dishes.
I am making chicken Milanese with fettuccini pasta and chimichurri.
I am making codfish tacos with a pomegranate salsa and crema.
Tom kha gai soup with jasmine rice and chicken meatballs.
Spicy seared pork loin with mixed pan-seared vegetables and a mustard cream sauce.
- You're very grown up for nine.

They follow it up with techniques that challenge those of professional chefs.
Graham:

Joe:

- Gordon:

I've filleted fish before.

Why are you poaching it inside a bag?
Because I wanted to add in more flavors.
How do you come up with these ideas at eight?
Because that is something very difficult to do, you know that?
When I was little...

- When did you stop being little?

Gordon:

I'm using science in this dish.
I injected my meat with marinade to break down the fibers in the meat to make it more tender.
- What are you doing back here?

- I don't understand.

- There's one.

- One pearl.

He's making, like, a caviar.
I'm using liquid nitrogen to super quick freeze my raspberries.
- Whoo.

It's incredible.

It's smoking time.
Whether you like it or not, right now you're looking at the future of food.
When you put all that talent together, it produces spectacular dishes.
I have for you risotto with shrimp.
That looks like something you would get at one of my restaurants.
Dara:

This is delicious.
This idea of doing this spiced chocolate, it's brilliant.
Gordon:

This is a pan-seared filet mignon with a boiled then basted lobster tail.
Execution, cookery, pro.
- How old are you again?

- I'm am 11 years old.

- I'm 10 years old.

If this is what you're like at ten,
God help our industry when you're 20.
And it won't be long before some of them are.
I own 31 restaurants around the world, so I know the rules of a professional kitchen.
But we all know some rules are there to be broken.
We've all heard the saying...
- Ahh!

Jeez!
Oh, brother.
- But if you must...

There are three rules you have to follow.
- Whatever.

- Rule number one...

never run in the kitchen.
- Andele!

Jack, cooking with you is like running a marathon.
- Come on, come on, come on,

- Oh, oh!

The MasterChef Junior kitchen, it's like a jungle gym.
- Here's a basket.

You just run.
- Ahh!

Run from one corner...
- to the other corner...

- To the other corner...

- You make me feel dizzy.

- To the other corner.

- Riley, he went that way, bud.

It's ridiculous.
I feel like a ninja right now.
Gordon:

Darn it.
Gosh dang it.
- Oh, gosh.

Are you the next Graham Elliot?
I hope so.
When I cook, I make a big mess.
Oh!
Ah.
- Whoa.

Ugh.
- Oh, gosh.

Ah.

- What...

I just spilled hot venison and scorching hot butter on the greatest chef in the world's foot.
- Dang it.

Hello.
Oh, my God.
- Sounds like me in the kitchen.

But there's glass.
Sorry.
Gordon:

- rule number three.

Don't let kids play with fire.
- That was awesome.

Oh!

Oh!

It's cool to get to burn things.

- Whoa, Addison!

- Fire!

Holy cow!

It's going to be an honor to cook at your house.
Thank you, JJ.

He's never coming to my house.
After the break, on this extra serving of "MasterChef Junior,"
a look at what happens when we take the kids out into the real world, more unseen bloopers, and more moments like this.
- Oh!

- Oh.

Not easy.
- Oh, yeah.

What did I ever do to you, Samuel?
Yes!
Oh, man.
Man:

Oh!
Medic!
I'm totally fine.
I'm totally fine.
Welcome our new judge, sliding all the way down here from Brooklyn.
Good thing she bakes better than she skates.
Welcome back to this extra serving of "MasterChef Junior."
To really test the skills of our talented young home cooks, we introduce them to the pressures of the real restaurant world.
And believe me, it's tough out there.
- Are we ready?

Gordon:

Get 'em on high, Get 'em on high.
To survive a "MasterChef Junior" field challenge.
Wow.
When going to the greatest locations across the country, be ready for anything.
- Oh, my God!

This is so unbelievably cool.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, this is so cool, but please don't flip over.
- Let's go!

Always be prepared to feed amazing VIPs.
51 first responders.
Christina:

- My four children.

I can't wait to see what food comes out of the kitchen.
Gordon:

Patrick:

I'm expecting there to be some fantastic food today.
Everything should be nine and three quarters or a perfect ten.
Just one more thing.

Age means nothing.
You gotta be kidding me.

- Gordon:

- so always keep calm.

- Like I do.

Hold on, Sarah, I'm trying to do something.
I cannot believe how crazy it is.
Get this on the plate.

- Focus.

We had a plate ready!

- You don't have to get upset at everyone.

- I'm just stressed.

What?

No... okay, I'll do it.

- Pull it together!

- What's going on?

Amaya's crumbling like a piece of paper.
What's in a vinaigrette?
- Lemon, lime, olive oil!

- A vinaigrette!

Yes, Chef!
Never, ever, ever lose your temper.
I'm not interested in how old you are.
I'll be treating you like professional chefs, got it?
Kids:

Are we gonna see the mean side of Gordon Ramsay?
We can't serve the Scouts raw pork.
A good vet could bring that back to life.
Do I need to call 911?

It looks like a dog's dinner.
It looks like my grandma's knickers.
Absolute baloney.
- Thank you.

Absolute nightmare.

Ahh!
Matt!
Gordon:

The stuffing in the interior was lovely.
- Prepared perfectly.

The taste was even better than the plating.
Would you like to meet the chefs that cooked your amazing lunch?
Here they are.
Our amazing young talented chefs.
Christina:

Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is "MasterChef Junior."
If you could say in one word how it was working under Gordon Ramsay
- what would it be?

Never mind those kids.

Now it's time to take a look at what's become of some more "MasterChef Junior" alumni.
This time, it's the kids of season two.
Whoa.
I'm Abby from "MasterChef Junior" season two.
I was eight on the show and now I'm 11.
- Gordon:

I think I went a little bit crazy at the pancake challenge.
Flip those pancakes faster!
I still want to own a half-restaurant, half-veterinary clinic when I grow up.
So I can bring my horses in the back, and then while they're getting treated,
- I can have lunch on the table with the goldfish.

I haven't opened my restaurant yet, but...
I do have this.
What I'm gonna do is use this as a varnish.
- As a garnish.

Hi, my name is Josh.

Now I'm a teenager.
My voice changed a little bit, and I got much taller, but I still love to cook.
What's up, guys?

When I was on the show,
I was 12 years old, but now I am 15.
What inspires you to have your own restaurant?

I just want to be like you.
There's professional chefs watching you with their jaw on the floor.
I'm Adaiah.

I'm writing my own cookbook, and I can't wait to share it with people.
Ah, beautiful.
Hi, I'm Logan, winner of "MasterChef Junior" season two.
The main life lesson that I learned from "MasterChef Junior"
was to keep your standards at the very highest.
And why did you come into this competition?
I came to this competition to get better.
Good man.

Logan:

The flavor.

The class of 2014, a really talented bunch.
Now, whatever the year, whatever the season, we always expect the talented young home cooks to deliver delicious dishes using some very, very tricky ingredients.
One protein that every great chef has to master...
Please don't be hard.

- Is beef Wellington.

- Steak.

- Christina:

Graham:

- Christina:

Kids:

Aw, this is gonna be difficult.
Gordon:

Come on, steak.
Because it's not just about how it looks on the outside.
Looking good.
It's about how it's cooked on the inside.
Justise:

I am just praying,
"Please be perfect."
- This is the moment of truth.

Christina:

‚ô™ Dun, dun, dah!

Gordon:

Cydney:

And I want to stay in this competition so badly.
Let's see.
That is beautiful.
- Thank you.

- That is cooked beautifully.

- I mean, really beautiful.

Gordon:

What is going on here?
Are you sure you cooked it for 35 minutes?
Yes, Chef.
- Was the oven on?

Oh.
Raw chicken.
- Damn.

Ooh, it's a little overcooked.
Gordon:

Slightly overcooked.

A tad over there.
You have a great sear on that salmon, but it's a little bit overcooked.
Alexander:

- Perfect.

That is perfect.
It's truly something to be proud of.
It's the kind of beef Wellington that I'd be serving at the Savoy Grill.
Christina:

Gordon:

A little red in the middle.
Nailed it, big time.
That's what a perfectly-cooked salmon looks like.
That is cooked beautifully.
Graham:

What should I be expecting inside the salmon?
- Perfect.

Uh, guys, the salmon is perfect.
This is better than eating all the ice cream in the world!
You sound like a chef, you cook like a chef, and you are confident, but you've got the right to be confident, 'cause you can cook.

Thank you, Chef.
Amazing.
Now, you want to see more kids laughing at me, and kids generally humiliating me, then make sure you come back after the break, but for now, here are some kids just putting pies in my face.
Get him good.
- One.

All:

Ugh!
Yeah!
Kid:

Oh!
Kid:

Under your box you guys have all sorts of amazing stinky cheese.
Have any of you guys ever cut the cheese?
That's funny, Gordon!
Uh, what's so... what's so funny about that?

In my kitchen in London, I cut the cheese every night.
- Oh, no!

I love cutting the cheese.
I do it every night before I go to bed.

When you "cut the cheese," you fart.
What?
You guys have got such strange expressions, honestly.
I still don't know what's wrong with cutting the cheese.
Maybe it's because I live in England, or I'm just not down with the kids, but sometimes in the kitchen, it really feels like I'm speaking a completely different language.
You've got sesame seed vinaigrette going on there.
Okay, thank you.
Yes, sesame seed?
Um, no, Chef.
Gordon:

Um, no, Chef.
There is definitely sesame seed in there.
That... what that is is...

It... no, it's not sesame seed.
What I put in it is just... um, sesame oil.
Ahh!
Blue Team, on order, two covers away.
Table 17.

Entree, one ravioli, one branzino.
What?
- Shall I tell you what makes me laugh?

I saw Graham in a pair of speedos yesterday.
Honestly, I peed my pants.
You're still not gonna be able to break him.
Gordon:

OMGD.
- Do you know what that means?

Oh, my goodness, delicious.
Oh, yay.
OMFG.
- The "F" stands for "food."

They are VIPs, not P-I-G-S.
What does that mean?
- Um, pigs.

Gordon:

- Give me an L.

- Give me an L.

- Give me an L.

- E.

- M.

- O.

- N.

- What does it mean?

Oh ho ho!
Lemon, man, lemon!
- Oh.

That was my next guess.
Gordon:

You look like a little girl!
I cannot wait to kick your butts.
I cannot wait to kick your butt.
Kick your butt.
Does that suit me?
Do I look like some Karate Kid now?
Kind of.
Kah-jah!
- Ooh...

Andrew.
It lives in swamps.
It loves eating.
It has a lot of teeth.
And when this guy gets angry... he can...
- snap!

Jeez, come on!
When the kids sit in this interview chairs, they always give us some real pearls of wisdom.
They also give us moments we can't always put in the show.
Well, we can now.
Woman:

I need food.
Woman:

Okay, so tell me so...
Why is there a mic right here, and then a mic right here?
You have to say, "Rolling in three, two, one."
- Man:

Man:

Man:

Woman:

Man:

I don't know, it's not supposed to beep when it's counting down.
Man:

Man:

Um, um...
Man:

We gotta get real for a second.
Okay, thank you.
Yeah, but it was beeping, like...
Man:

Man:

Is that a question?
Man:

No.

- That's too corny, huh?

- Okay, I apologize.

I smile so much my face hurts.
- It does?

- Is your face hurting right now?

Looking at Sam's dish, his looks pretty goodly.
"Goodly"?

Woman:

In entrees, I am working on the gnocchi.
Man:

Woman:

Hurry up.

Man:

Man:

Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Man:

- Did you just fart?

It's lunchtime?

- Man:

Woman:

Man:

- No.

The end.
Not quite.

First, a look back when the judges got more frosting on our heads than in our mouths.
All:

Frosting fight!
Frosting fight!

Honestly.
Man:

Happy holidays, home cooks.

I love the holidays, and I love to dress like a elf.
Honestly.
Are we being punked today, or is this real?
What has happened?
15 years ago, won my third Michelin star,
I had no idea I'd be doing this.
- Oh, my God.

I kept that costume.
All the kids that take a place in the competition go home in their famous "MasterChef Junior" white aprons.
Right now, it's time to find out if the kids from season three are still cooking up a storm at home in their aprons.
- Welcome.

Hey guys.

You are officially the youngest competitor
- we've ever had in this kitchen.

I'm in fifth grade right now, and I'm 11 years old.
Double digits.
What in the world?
Hi everyone, it's Kayla.
I was 11 when I was on the show, and now I'm officially a teenager.
I'm 13.

Amazing.
Now I am really into makeup.
I still love to cook, and I love spending time with my family, and my friends.
- Steak up.

Thank you, Chef.

I was 12 on the show and now I'm 15.
I guess you could say my style's gotten a bit edgier, dyed hair and pierced earrings and all that.
Congratulations, Nathan.
My message to Gordon would be thank you for teaching me so much about cooking, and inspiring kids all over the world.
You have more steak on your apron than you do on the plate.
Yeah, um, it got messy.
Hi, I'm Andrew from "MasterChef Junior" season three.
I'm 14 years old.

I still enjoy cooking.
I have plans to open a restaurant.
My favorite moment on the show was when raspberries fell on us.
It stained my shirt and it stained my shoes.
I really liked them shoes.
They don't fit me anymore.
Hey guys!

Things I want to do when I grow up:
I want to be a CEO, and I want to be a chef.
Love you guys, and muah!
Some real stars in there from season three.
Over the five seasons of "MasterChef Junior", we've learned a lot of things about the power and the potential of America's kids.
I've also learned that this country's children have hearts of gold.
Although this is a competition, that doesn't stop kids giving a helping hand to their fellow competitors.
- You need help?

- Thank you.

Thank you.
Oh, thank you!
- Do you have corn starch?

- How's that?

- Yes!

Mashu's in the front, and even though this is a competition, that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna help.
Can you reach the thyme for me?
- Sure, here.

- You're welcome.

I don't know what to do.

- Did you break your sauce?

Put it over the heat.

- I'm trying to.

This is good.

Even though this is a competition, it's nice to know that somebody's there for you, and that all of your friends are gonna be able to help you.
Let me tell you something.

You did something tonight that we never see.
With three minutes to go, to go and to help Jenna tonight was extraordinary.
Uh, you've nailed it.
The dish looks fantastic.
Gordon:

things don't always go to plan...
Oh.

In the MasterChef kitchen.
The sad news is the chicken is undercooked.
- It's okay.

Abby:

You're okay.
I don't want to see her cry.
None of us, I don't think, are A-plus students all the time.
It's okay, Evan.
We all have our off days.
It's okay, Lila.
Relax, don't cry.

- You did good, Lila.

Gordon:

Jacelyn, it's okay.
That's when they pull together.
Gordon:

Gonna miss you.
Come here.
I love you so much, okay?
You did great today.

It was beautiful.

Guys, we worked our butts off.
- Hey, we did a good job.

- Blue Team for life.

You guys did great.
- You did amazing.

You'll be okay, right?
- You did amazing.

Don't cry.
There's no way that you're not gonna make it.
Thank you for trying to comfort me.
Nice job.
I think my favorite thing about this whole experience is just all the friends that I've made.
I'll miss you guys.
It was a pleasure meeting you.
It was a pleasure meeting you.
- Group hug.

Come on, you guys did awesome.
You guys did great.
I think I'll have these friends for a very long time.
Until I'm about 50.
Can you imagine being as old as 50?

After the break, we'll take a quick look back at some of the most epic "MasterChef Junior" finales and I've got a very special surprise in store for you.
But first, take a look at what happens when a talented Michelin-star chef becomes a human corn dog.
- Oh!

Sorry to say...
Chef, but it's you.
Christina:

Make room for me!
Welcome back to an extra serving of "MasterChef Junior".
Ever since we began, every season has ended in magnificent, jaw-dropping grand finales.
Here's a quick look back at how those finales served up some five-star dishes and unmissable TV.
Gordon:

I'm not going home without that trophy.
I'm here to take the title.
Alexander is running slightly behind.
The veal's not seared.
The prawn itself, is that gonna get cooked off at the last second?
Um yeah, I'm gonna saut√© it.
Smart, 'cause it'll turn to rubber real quick.
I love the fact that you steamed those.
That's the kind of mentality that a chef has.
Young man, that is one of the best cooked veal chops anywhere in the country tonight.
Thank you.
I think that it's gonna be a very close battle.
Logan:

Gordon:

Graham:

You got seven minutes left, and your Arctic char is still not cooked.
What are you doing?

Gordon:

It really has that wow factor.
Joe:

Good job.
Nathan:

This is the biggest thing of my entire culinary career.
Graham:

If I can pull it off, I'll definitely impress you guys.
You're using one of the most expensive lamb cuts anywhere in the world, the rack of lamb.
How are you gonna pull this off?

I've cooked it a few times.
Graham:

Joe:

Unbelievable.
This is the battle of the girls!
I have fought for my place in the finale.
Why so complicated on a night like tonight?
I think it's go big or go home right now.
This is a hard dish to create in just 90 minutes.
Gordon:

Oh, my God.
The winner.
Congratulations...
Alexander.
Oh, my God!
Logan!
Nathan!
Addison!
Addison:

and now I'm part of a unique family.
I will never forget this life-changing experience.
Mind-blowing.

Alexander.
Logan.
Nathan.
And of course, our reigning champ, Addison.
Come on down.
Good to see you guys.
Welcome back.
You good?
- Very good.

Right, first off, Alexander.
How does it feel to be back in the MasterChef kitchen, because you were 13 when you won "MasterChef Junior"
You're now 17.

- Winning.

What's happening now at 17?

Right now I'm doing college applications, but during my summers I've been spending time in kitchens, really immersing myself with chefs, and really experiencing what it's like to work on a line.
Logan.

You and I must have the same hairdresser, 'cause that looks exactly like mine.
- How old are you now?

14 years of age.
Are you still as ambitious now as you were a couple of years back?
Of course, Chef.

I'm "Fortune" magazine's 18 Under 18 Most Influential Teens.
I'm "Time" magazine's Most Influential Teen.
I've traveled to India, and judged the Young Chef Olympiad.
Amazing.

- I'm 15 now.

During my junior year of high school,
I'm actually going on foreign exchange to Japan, just to kind of reinforce my culinary passion.
Love that.

What's it like being a reigning champion of "MasterChef Junior,"
and we're about to crown, weeks from now, our next champion.

It's amazing.

What was it like going home?
Do you look at food differently now at school?
A little bit.

Good girl.
- You bring your own.

I'll bring, like, lentil soup.
Brilliant.
Right.

"MasterChef Junior" continues next Thursday at 8:00 pm here on FOX.
Trust me, the next episode is one you should not miss.
It looks like this.

Announcer:

Please welcome Miss Piggy...
C'est moi!
And the Swedish Chef!
‚ô™ Dum dum dum ‚ô™
Gimme that!
Gordon:

I'd like to order steak frites.
Hopefully Miss Piggy won't be too much of a distraction.
Gordon:

- Ahh!

Huh?
Put him on a leash.
Chef, Chef, Chef, Chef, Chef.
