[Sighs] You let a wanted felon waltz back into your life and steal your kids.
How could you let him do that?
I...
You are terrible parents.
We've been told that a few times.
Children are your life's blood.
They are so precious.
I mean, I'm sure they were when they were younger.
Yeah, well, the daughter is a bit on the spectrum.
And their son, I don't know how he functions in life.
I mean, you should have seen him.
He was getting this handy from...
- Whoa, whoa.

Hey.

Were you spying on us?
In our home?
Don't doodle.

Did you put a camera in our house?
- Kids?

- It's 9:30.

We've got some stuff to talk to you about.
Guys?

Jared?
We've got some news.

Hey.
Kids?
I can't find them.
- Maybe they're down at Chase's?

- What are you do...

Say words with your mouth.

Bags?
Oh, bugs?
That's what this...

You call an exterminator.
What is your problem?
Nate, pour children are not at the Lewises'.
Go faster, go faster, go faster.

Why...

Just show it to me.
Hurry.
People are liste...

Yes, the walls are paper thin.
We've established this.

Baby, what are you doing?

- Stop eating that.

- What?

[Gasps] It's too thick.
It's the evidence.
[Whispering] See the camera?
Oh, shit.

- Who was right?

- I hate it when he's right.

- My father.

- The mail police!

- Help me with this.

- Help me get this off.

Yep.

Get off.
Nate:

What?
Why would you put that in there?
God.
[Grunts]
No wonder I was getting such a shitty night's sleep.
Ah.
What are you doing?

- It's not what it looks like.

Which, that wasn't me, by the way.
The kids must have...
Oh my God!

It's all a part of his escape plan.
- What kind of plan is that?

It's a candy bar and chocolate sauce, so nobody looks in the toilet.
It's still disgusting looking.
- What is that?

Oh!

- Open it.

- It's chocolate sauce!

What is this, airline tickets?

- No.

And what are these numbers?
- They're coordinates.

Who gives us coordinates?
- He took our children.

Why would he take our children?
He took our children in exchange for that.

Say goodbye to a formerly great country, kids.
- Yeah.

Not really.

No.

I don't think so.
You came willingly.
You said our parents were gonna be here.
No.

Don't worry.

I know I left the keys in here somewhere.
Why don't we just fly?
Because I'm on the no-fly list.
How do you get on that list, anyway?
- I'll tell you later.

Look, I didn't get a chance to straighten up, but she's a good van.
Thank you for doing this, again.
And the speedometer, odometer, and tachometer, they're all a little finicky.
You know, most of it's just there for show.
Sure.

Not since the mid '90s.
So I wouldn't push it more than two hours before a refill.
- [Keys jingle]

Great.

Listen to me, okay?

When the chips are down, we're there for each other.
We're resilient in the face of adversity.
Although some people say we're a little rude, we're a little quick to anger...
I'm so sorry.

- Sorry.

Get right to the point.
But underneath all that bluster, we're in it together.
So how long you need it for?
A week?

Ooh, slight problem.
Sometimes when I'm in between places, I sleep in my vehicle.
Like, for the last couple of years.
Okay.

What?
The rent's paid through the end of the month
And then after that, I don't know what we're gonna do.
- Okay.

- Thanks again, man.

- Thank you so much.

- No, I got it.

Yeah.
- Okay.

- All right.

- Yep.

I'm not a hugger.

Bring those kids home safe, huh?
- Yep.

He's kissing me.
We just heard the news.
- Just awful.

- Thank you.

Oh, and we brought you some homemade caramel corn
- for the trip.

We really have to go.

All families go through this.

Our little family's going through its own tragedy.
We're very sorry, but we really have to go.
I found a lump.
- That's...

This one's not looking good.
- It's spreading.

Nate, we have to go.

- She has cancer.

Just have some sympathy.
- She's only 25.

You're pushing this age thing way too far.
Okay, hold on.

- Our cat.

She's not really a cat person.
You understand.

But she's got lumps.

I don't really give a shit, either.

Thanks for these!

You know it took us six days to drive to Florida last time.
That's why we're not stopping this time.
Gave us first-class tickets.

Can I remind you that he kidnapped our children for a piece of metal?
So maybe let's have a little perspective.
Is it really kidnapping if he's their grandfather?
Yeah.

Don't fall for his bullshit, Nate.
My opinion of my dad is our opinion.

I got it, got it.

- First-class seats.

I've never flown first class before.
I hear it's really great.
- It's fine.

You know, back when I was flying economy, middle seats, all those business trips for PFR.
I'd walk past those guys that get to go on first.
And then they're sitting there with their hot nuts and free newspapers, drinking mimosas.
Lie-flat beds.
Of course I wouldn't use that.

[Chuckles]
I was like, "One day."
One day, I'm gonna be up in front of that curtain."
And here it is.
And we get to use it.
They give you socks.
Socks.

- You have socks.

That's something special.
Is it?
They've never touched the ground.
Literally.
You kids want anything?
Pilot can play the violin if you want.
Or she can give you a massage.
I think I should do some pushups first.
What should we call you?
Whatever you want to call me.

But you're our grandfather.
We can't call you by your actual name.
That's a bit traditional, but okay, sure.
What do you got?
What about just "grandpa"?
Mm, that makes me feel kind of old.
- Baba?

- Grandfather?

- Bobo.

- G Daddy.

- Grampy.

- What about just Gramps?

You know what...
What about PP?
What the hell does that even mean?

Oh, damn it.

What's stuck?
- Floss is stuck.

I am.

Babe, I don't like the way this feels.
- I really...

Can you get something to cut it out?
- What do you want me to cut it with?

Jesus.

Why would I bite it out?
Because I need it out of my mouth.
Just get it out.
You want me to bite it out of your face?
- Yes, bite it out of my face.

Do something, because I can't handle this.
Oh, my God.

Just look at the road.

I just...

Here, here.

Oh, God.

Is that better?

Oh, God.
Are you having an orgasm?
No.

So, tell me about yourselves.
As people.
You got a girlfriend?
She doesn't like to be called that, but we're moving pretty fast.
- We don't like labels.

He's over 2,000 years old, has long hair, and a beard.

How long have I been asleep?
- What?

- You were driving.

A couple highway markers, tops.

You mean mile markers?
What was the last one you saw?
17, I think?
You've been asleep for three miles?
Okay, okay.

But that's only two and half minutes at this sp...
You were supposed to keep me awake!
Don't slap me.

God.

No.

I'm...

- Hey.

- Hit me in the face.

- To keep me awake.

Don't hit me hit me, just slap me, like normal people.
It's the only way I know how to hit... hard.
God.
You know there's other ways to stay awake.
How's that feel?

No, it's...

Too high?
Too...

Way, way too low.
- What?

Oh, okay.
There's your...
- My zipper.

- That's my zipper.

- Is that stimulating you?

- Is it keeping you awake?

Then we accomplished something.
Yay, one for Nate.
Let's pull over and pee and we'll get some fresh air.
- I'm not stopping.

- I'm not stopping.

Find me something to pee in, then.
It's going to have to be, like, this big for you to pee in it.
No, it's way smaller.
My stream is tight, man.
Oh, my God.

Babe, let's go.

- I don't know what you want me to see.

- There's nothing back here.

I'm gonna do it.

- You what?

- Babe, pull over.

Here, hold the wheel.

It's fine.

Does this thing have cruise control?
Oh, my God.

Okay.

This is gonna save us a minute.

- It's for my children.

It's gonna fill up too fast.
It's gonna hit your fingers, you're gonna freak out, and you're gonna spill it all over your pants and your seat and it's gonna smell like a bus in here.
No one can say I'm not a good mom.
Why, because you're pissing in a cup?
No, because I'm doing what needs to be done.
God, you're stubborn.
- Oh, God.

Would you stop?

- Okay.

Oh, it's so hot.
You spilled it all over my sweatshirt!
- Sorry.

- Caramel corn.

You've got some sort of kidney failure or something.
Oh, babe.
- What?

- Sorry.

- Yeah, I got it.

Whew.
What are you do...

What?
Don't just leave it there.

Where would you like me to put it?
Throw it out the window.
I'm not gonna throw it out the window, okay?
The wind will hit it, it'll whip back in my face.
- Then do it quickly!

[Laughs]
Why would you think the window was open, honey?
It does smell like popcorn.
Remember that guy Doctor Rob?
That was weird, right?
I think he lived, like, right off this exit.
Wonder if he ever got wise to those Russian chicks poisoning him?

I've known you for 14 years and seen you every day.

Just pull over.

I don't buy that whole two-hour thing.
That would mean this thing only gets six miles a gallon.

I don't...
- What's happening?

This shit doesn't work.
When was the last time you filled up?
- I don't know.

Pull over, pull over.

- I'm getting over!

Oh, I'm so sorry.
That does not count as an apology.
- [Mockingly] I'm sorry, then.

Much better.
Why don't we just walk to a gas station?
- It's six miles round trip.

Why don't we just ask someone around here for help?
Honey, there's not anyone around here.
Oh, there's not?

- You know what I hate about you?

That is a pretty strong word for this time of night.
All right.

Before we go down this delightful little rabbit hole, you sure you want to?
You play dumb.
- That's it?

Okay.

By the way, I wasn't playing dumb.
I was being sarcastic.
But either way, sorry.

Are there, like, a million things you hate about me?
- Hate?

I'm not happy about a few things, like you keeping your entire criminal past from me.
Oh, because we tell each other everything?
You've told me everything?

Except that one time.

I lost my job.

Okay?

- That's not true.

- Did you sleep with my sister?

Our childrens' friends.
- Did you?

- Did you sleep with my sister?

Did you have sex with my sister?
I don't even know what that means.
Did your penis go inside my sister's vagina?
- Briefly.

I didn't want to.

- No, I mean, I knew, but...

- It was the worst.

- And it smelled.

It makes it worse.

- She was hitting me.

You know what made it worse?

- You couldn't get it up?

Like, you just keep going and going.
- That's not what whiskey dick is.

No.

I should really stop bragging about that.
- Who are you bragging to?

People who listen.

You're not...
I got to talk to him about something.
- You don't!

Listen, she was a mistake.
The biggest mistake of my life, made worse by the fact that I fell in love with that mistake's sister.
Sorry.
God, this will not open.
Babe.

Well, I didn't know it opened that way.
- Carlos.

That's that thing.

- What thing?

- You're doing it again!

You're playing dumb again.
You know exactly what I'm asking you but you pretend like you don't.
And then you come back and you ask another question, but your voice goes up like 18 octaves.
What are you talking about?

I don't, okay?

Okay.

Okay, I'm good.
Okay, I broke his jaw.
But he fell down the stairs on his own.
Not my fault.

Oh, shit, there's somebody in there.

Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

I'm sorry, baby.

Straight shot to Florida.
You okay?

Can I sleep for a little bit?
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

All that's missing is my children.
I know, I know.

Use that rage.
That rage will keep you awake.
Is this blanket safe?
[Sniffs] Nope.

Oh, that smell's gonna be with me for a while.
