- Do you think we'll get in?

- 1940.

OK.
- Stop it.

That boy's here again.

- The one with the Mod hair?

The one over there.

- He's a bit square.

Do you think?

That's not a job.
- He's coming over!

- What if he asks you to dance?

- I wouldn't be too sure.

Pity.
I've been practising my moves since I first saw you.
Dip-da-dip da-dip Moon, moon, moon, blue moon
Dip-da-dip da-dip Moon, moon, moon, blue moon
Dip-da-dip da-dip Bom-ba-ba bom, bom-ba-bom-bom
Bom-ba-ba bom, danga-dang-dang
- Blue moon

- You saw me standing alone

- Without a dream in my heart

- Without a love of my own

Bom-ba-ba bom, danga-dang-dang, dinga-dong-ding
- Blue moon

You knew just what I was there for...
The toilet's occupied.

- You got cake!

- Ta-da!

Oh, I'll never have to type another boring letter again.
What about that job at Vogue?
- Vogue?

Didn't take it.

Ooh.
- Thanks, Tina.

You've had a good education.

Not many girls round here went to a grammar school.
And all that money I spent on those elocution lessons.
Mmm, and fencing lessons.
Er... they were good.
What for?
For your posture.
I've always had high hopes for you, Tina Dean.
I know, and I'm grateful.
But you don't have to worry about me any more.
I've got a great future... as Mrs Moore.
Keep your heads up.

Visualise where they are.

Find space.

Hurst!
Moore-o, Byrne, Dear, Peters, Boycey...
Concentrate.

Hurst, Boyce, Bond... .. Crawford, Musgrove, Peters,
Kirkup, Lansdowne.
Boss?

Sorry, boss.

It's not every day you get married.
Just make sure you come back fresh from the honeymoon.
Ten out of ten, by the way.

Ladies and gentlemen...
As is customary, I'd like to say a few words.

Go on, Bobby!
Tina, I've never seen you look so beautiful as you do today.
Erm...

That's Perce's mob from the Prue, not her ex-boyfriend, I hope!
No, I want to give you everything, because, well, you're my princess, and you deserve nothing less.
Thank you for coming, everyone, and please welcome my Best Man, Mr Noel Cantwell.
Actually, er... do you mind if I...?
Er...

I know this is a bit unusual, but... since Tina's father's not around,
I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't say something.
I can't tell you how thrilled I am that my Tina has married a man like Bobby.
He's kind, modest, loyal, and I hear he's quite good in defence, as well.
Of course, when they first met,
Tina thought she could do better than a footballer.
But luckily... .. well, she's just like her mum, and she knows when she's wrong.
Am I gonna get a word in?
Noel's right.

Ladies and gents...

I'm so happy for you.
So, what can I say about my old Hammers team-mate?
Young Moore-o here.
Well, I'll start by saying that the lovely wives and girlfriends don't really know how physical the sport actually is, but, Tina, you will understand tonight how rough Bobby's tackle actually is.
Wow.
You look... amazing.
Ooh.
Too much fizz on the plane.
Erm...

Mum said to get some Rendells spermicide, because we don't want to have babies straightaway.
'Have some fun first, Tina, for goodness' sake.'
I was embarrassed.

Came out with Rennie's antacid.
Well, at least I won't get hiccups, anyway...
The house will be ready for when we come back.
I'm gonna take care of you.
And I will.

I want to make you happy, Bobby.
I've been waiting to be alone with you all day.
Me too.
You know... if it doesn't feel right...

- Cheers.

Go in the water.

It'll ruin my hair.
Give me it.

How do I turn it off?
Right.

Oh, my hair!

Stop it!

Do you feel different?
Erm...

Maybe.
You?
I feel...
Soft?
Grown up.
Moore-o!

- Tina, it's lovely to see you.

All right, Tina?

Hi!

- What a surprise!

Remember when he was 12, sat beside me on the team bus, and he said,
'Mr Allison, what's the most important thing about football?

'Knowing what you're going to do with the ball before you get it.' You were a great coach.
So, what do you think of Greenwood's new formation, playing further back, like you always wanted?
Do you... do you come to Majorca every year?

I love this heat.
I went overboard with the olive oil.

- I see you ordered the pork belly!

You only use that right foot to take a step into the bar!
Oh, what are you doing?

Did they all plan this?
No.

But we're on our honeymoon!
Darling, you married a footballer.
You might be his wife, but the game will always be his mistress.
They're lads.
Don't take it personally.

No.

He's not like the others.

Football's the last thing on his mind.
It's all right.
When we get back, we'll be all right.
This is the life
Here's where the living is
This is the life
Baby, you're there
Bobby!
Here we go.
You've waited long enough
Is it how you imagined?

Wine and perfume
Silver and candlelight
Children, make way
I'm here to stay
An indoor loo!
That's how it's gonna be
- Well, do you like it?

This is the life for me
Pass and move, guys.

Come on, Bob.

Well done, Bob.
Quick, quick, quick.

- Mind if I...?

OK, lads.

Pass and move.
Most certainly, I've been pleased with your form, Bobby.
You've got a commanding presence on the pitch and your fellow players listen to you.
Thank you very much.
One is aware, of course, of the tremendous responsibility for a man of just 23, and I don't want to put undue pressure on your shoulders... but, personally, I would be delighted if you would accept the position of captain.
Blimey.
Am I to take that as a yes?
Thank you, Mr Ramsey.
Thank you very much.
I think your white sauce might be burning.
Looks all right.
Are you meant to boil roast potatoes?
Yes.

'Par-boil for ten minutes.' How long have they been in there?
- Oh, God.

And there's always that new Chinese.
Mum, Dad, come in.
Just through here.
Oh, Bobby!

Nice to see you.

Hello, Doris.

- Mum... can you come here for a sec?

Hello, love.

OK.

- We're having chicken.

Ah, Tina...
Lovely.

That's for Bobby.

- Thank you.

I've never had mashed potato with a roast before.
So, er...

Tell me... how does it feel to lead the national team out?
Well, I find out in June.
We play Czechoslovakia, and then on to Germany and Switzerland.
June?

Erm...

Alf wants to shake things up, make every player properly commit.
More training sessions, tours.
We er... we've all got to up our game, if we want to be taken seriously at the next World Cup.
If you play for England, you make sacrifices.
I'll show you my technique with his kit...

Robert's always had a larger than average girth.
Thanks.
I'm sure I can master a needle and thread.
Lovely carrots.
'Tony Wagstaff to brother Barry.'
Right, then, Hurst...

'Tony Wagstaff is playing very well.

No way!

- Come on, West Ham!

Take it up the left!
You've got eyes up your arse, Ref!
Shocking!
That was nowhere near offside.
Get on him!
Nice arse, Bobby!
Show us your legs, Bobby!
You've been stitched up, Moore-o!
Robert will be mortified.

- It was a mistake, Doss.

Small mercies.

I just hope he knows it wasn't my doing.
Er...

- Mr Moore.

- Well played, son.

- Mum...!

Are you all right, Bobby?

Oh, it's a niggle.

Mm-hm.
- Real charmer

Take him with a pinch of salt.

All right.

Ooh, lovely.
Are you nervous?
They're just friendlies.
Well, I need to prove Alf was right.
You will.
You remember that job I was offered before we were married?

Well, I got a call from a friend who works there and, apparently, they're looking for an assistant to the editor.

- You don't need to worry about work.

I just thought it would be nice.
Mum and I used to get Vogue as a treat.
What's this all about?
I hate the thought of letting you down.
I just don't think I'm cut out for this domestic stuff.
I know.
We can always get some help round the house.
And...

Now, are you gonna be all right here without me?
Yeah.
Is that injury still bothering you?
Eh?
Well, what did the physio say?
He's not worried.

I Love You, Baby
I love you so
I need you, honey
I'll never let you go, cos you're the girl in my heart
You're the one I adore
And I love you
Jen, it's me.
What's 'escargots'?
Snails.
You're kidding?
No.

No, it's not the English type.

French.
What's the difference?
They wear little berets.
Kathy!

Hi!

Mwah.

I've seen you, but we haven't properly met.
Judith, Geoff Hurst's girlfriend.

- Well, I'll get Bobby on to him.

- Do you want to join us?

Oh, yeah.
One last glass?

Because you're drunk.

I really have to get back to the office.

That's fine.

Thanks.
Lovely seeing you.
Still all right with a week on Friday?

Oh, I thought that was the end-of-season do.
- Oh, yeah.

- Maybe the week after.

- Bye.

So, I haven't got a thing to wear.

- Shopping?

- And she locked me in!

- I was stuck.

Hey!

Oh, Geoff is gonna kill me.

Me and all.

- Will Bobby not mind?

And he won't be complaining when he sees me in my thigh-high boots!
Wooh!
Ah...
- What?

I may just be a genius.
Hello?
Hi.
- Wow!

You mastered the sewing.

Come on.
If it's got hair on it, I'm not eating it!

- Here, have you been to one?

I had something called a chicken biryani.

It was lovely, yeah, and the next day...
Right, that's it.

What are you doing?

All right, boys?

Just cos I'm a lady, it doesn't mean I speak a different language.
She's taken...

- You're a nut.

- Can I have a scotch, please?

Come on, Geoff.

- You know I hate dancing.

Oh, not again.
- It's fine.

You were hiding it from me.
Honestly, it comes and goes.

Yeah, well, so have I. Stop pretending.
Oh, God!
You were going for it last night.
So, you can and I can't?
Anyway...

Oh, yeah?

I'm gonna be a dad?
How long has it been there?

A year.
I'm referring you to a consultant immediately.
OK.

No, I mean today.
Well, I can't.

I'm sure Mr Greenwood will understand, given the circumstances.
I only called you because Tina insisted.
Yes, I'm glad she did.
You know I'm captain?

As I say, Bobby, I'm sure they'll understand.
Bye, Bobby, Tina.

What is it?
He wants me to go to the hospital...

- What for?

I don't understand.

Please, don't get dramatic.

It'll be nothing.
I'll give you a ring when it's time to pick me up.

And Tina, don't...
Don't tell anyone.
No point kicking up a fuss.
- Mrs Moore?

Do you know where my husband is?
- Could I have a word?

What is it?
I'm afraid I have to tell you that we found a tumour.
We had to remove the testicle.
But the good news is, we managed to excise it all.
Are you OK?
Would you like a glass of water?
What?

Er...

No, he...

It's a relatively common disease in young men.
But let me reassure you on this score:

He... he'll be OK?
There are treatment options available.

Have you told him?
In cases like this, we don't advise it.
But if you feel differently, I can explain the full diagnosis.
- I'll tell him he's got...

No.

You mustn't use that word.
It's like a death sentence.
Well, I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.
Yeah.

In the room down at the end.
Tina.
Ron.
Hello, Perce.
Who died?
Hello.
I'm sorry.

Would you like to talk?
It's my husband.
He's been diagnosed with erm...

A serious illness.
He might die, and look at me.
I'm about to have a baby, and I don't know if he's OK.
I mean, what if he was sick when I got pregnant?

What if the baby's got what?
I promised I wouldn't say anything.
I ain't told anyone.

Whatever you tell me is in complete confidence.
He's erm...
He's... he's got cancer.
I'm very sorry.
You can forget swearing... it's the worst word in the language, in my book.
- What has the doctor said?

And your husband is young, fit?
He's the captain of England, for God's sake.

Oh, bugger.
Sorry.
You won't say anything, will you?
I'll keep it strictly between me... .. and Him.
It must be very hard for you, not having anyone to talk to.
It's Bobby I'm worried about.
We're both trying to keep positive.
I know how frightened he is underneath.
I know how frightened I am.
What would I do without him?
There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear.
- What does that mean?

Trust in your strength, for you and for Bobby.
Well, I should be out of here in a week, and then I can think about training.
Well, you're not to worry.

But there's no reason I shouldn't fully recover.
I've just spoken to your surgeon, Bobby.

You're going to be out of action for at least three months.
Well, I'll let you rest.
Thanks for coming, boss.
I'll get the nurses to freshen this.
Ron?
Can I have a word?
I appreciate what you were trying to do in there, Ron.

And I respect the fact that you're a top-class manager.
But what you've just said to Bobby...
Shall I tell you how that came across?
Imagine if you were ill in hospital... and you call your wife, and you say, 'I'll be back as soon as I can.'
She says, 'It's all right, Ron.
Don't hurry back.
Everything here is marvellous.

Er...

He needs to be... encouraged.
Coaxed.
This must be a very upsetting time for you, Tina.

Take care, now.
So, Bobby, I've been reading, and, apparently, your problem isn't as serious as it used to be.
Just cos you've had an operation, it doesn't mean you'll have any issues.
Hey, can you knock?
- Knock?

Let me see.
I'm your wife.
Bobby...

It's fine.
Bobby, it's fine.
You can't tell... honest.
Don't, Tina.

Bobby...
Look at me.

You don't deserve this, Tina...
Hey...
Listen.
You're all I want.

Hey...
You're all I need.
I promise.
I love you.
It's OK.
Mr Moore?

Yeah.
We've got a little girl.
Hello, you.
Mum had an idea about the name.
Roberta.
I thought it had a certain ring to it.
Congratulations, darling.
I'm so lucky.
Two beautiful girls.
That's your special daddy.
We have to look after him.
All right, lads.

Got a feeling inside
Can't explain
It's a certain kind
Can't explain
I feel hot and cold
Can't explain
Yeah, down in my soul, yeah
Can't explain
- I said

I'm feeling good now, yeah, but
Can't explain
Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling blue
The things you say, well, maybe they're true...
West Ham!
West Ham!
- Coming in?

- Oh, how was it?

- You're sure you're not training too hard?

- You haven't showered?

I need to do my suit.
For once, you can do it in the morning.
OK?
OK.
Very OK, in fact!
Is this your idea of a new family car?
No.

This is Del.

- Absolute pleasure, Mrs Moore.

Your husband clearly has exceptional taste.
What can I say?
- Can we afford it?

- What, has Ron agreed?

Things are on the up, Perce.

Yeah.

I'll pop the kettle on.
Now...

Picked her up on a Friday night
You two love-birds take your time.
I knew everything gonna be all right
Sha-la-la-la-lee, yeah
Sha-la-la-la-lee
I asked her, 'Where do you wanna go?

Sha-la-la-la-lee, yeah
Well, we went someplace...
Come in.

Aston Villa next week.

Actually, I wanted to talk about something else.
- You're fit, healthy?

Good.

It's just erm...

And erm... you've...

But I've been thinking about my future.
Your future?
I need to set myself bigger challenges.
Winning cups is great, but...

I've built a team around you, Bobby.
You know I'm grateful, and you've taught me a lot.
You think that's what I want...

I need to look at the bigger picture.
A player's career is short.
Especially for me.
- Tottenham are interested.

That's out of the question.
Then pay me more.
Tottenham will give me a ten-grand signing-on fee alone.
I've got a family to think of.
Your contract runs out June the 30th.
The World Cup opener is July the 11th.
You know the rules.
If you don't sign a new contract with us, you won't be eligible to play.
No club.

More, more, more, more, more!
Come on.

You'll have to excuse them.

Unless it's a ruse to get one over on us!
I wouldn't put it past them.
- Here you are, love.

Look at him.

- How's he coping?

You know, he loves the big tournaments.
Bobby hasn't told you?
What?
Geoff, what?
Alf has left him out of the friendlies.
He's looking for a new captain, apparently.
Why?

All right, darling?
- Must have been going on for weeks.

Geoff says you're a whisker away from not playing in the World Cup!
- It won't come to that.

And what would you have done?

Geoff talks to her.
He couldn't believe you hadn't told me.
I thought we'd got over this.

We are.

What good is more money if we don't have a happy marriage?
You know, I used to be so sure.
So confident that what we had was different.

Clearly, I was just kidding myself.
Even after the operation, you wouldn't talk to me.
Tina...

That's not me.

- This is completely different.

Because...

Right?
Stop the car.

- No.

Tina, what the hell are you doing?

Come back!
Tina!
Yeah, of course.
I'll give you one minute.
I want this resolved.
Here it is.

Same terms.
Be good for Mummy, now, won't you?

You know how sorry I am, don't you?
Sorry I threw the ring.

No.

It's just...
All this Ron stuff and... .. to top it off, the press are on our backs.
They don't think we stand a hope in hell.
I believe in you, Bobby.
And when you come back with the World Cup, you can shove it in his face.
We can spend some proper time together.
Away from football, for once.
Really?
I promise.
- Goodbye.

Say 'bye'.

Hello.
Bye!
Only a few months, and then we get Daddy all to ourselves.
Mwah.

When we played our charade
We were like children posing
Playing at games
Acting out names
Guessing the parts
We played
