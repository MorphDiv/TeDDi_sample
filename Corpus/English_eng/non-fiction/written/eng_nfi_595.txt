You're back.

So happy.
Eric knew who my mother was.
He knew all along.
If he's okay with me being here, then you should be, too.
Not that simple, Ms. Carlson.
Have at it.
The bank made an urgent call for I.T. last night due to a loss of service.
Disrupt service overnight so they can gain entry as I.T. engineers in the morning... they're professionals.
Professionals don't want to be surrounded by the police.
They should have anticipated someone would have activated the alarm.
Well, maybe they did.

Who triggered the alarm?
Angela Rose, one of the private security guards.
What are the hostage takers asking for?
Nothing so far.
Hostage takers with no demands... that's different.
Not so different.
San Francisco, January 2005, we had a similar situation.

Sharp, little memory you got there, Ms. Denard.
Ah, the better to keep you from pulling the wool over my eyes, Mr. Beaumont.
Hi.

Nathalie Denard.

We resolve kidnap and hostage situations for Ms. Denard's clients all over the world.
Which means we see a lot of each other.
Mm, too much, actually.

Elizabeth Bloom, chief of the board of directors.
Would you like to meet her?
Oh, I'd be delighted, yeah.
Follow me.
You're allowed to come.
Is this her?
Move that appointment to later this afternoon.
Ms. Bloom, this is Eric Beaumont.
- Beaumont.

- Your reputation precedes you.

This is Zara Hallam, formerly NYPD and our chief investigator.
Investigator?
I thought you were negotiators.
Information's vital to a negotiation.
Zara makes sure we have a full command of the facts.
I'm Oliver Yates, a psychologist.
I profile the hostage takers.
And I'm Maxine Carlson, the bugger.
Bugger?
Maxine's in training.
I ask her to second-guess all my decisions so she can learn to bug me.
She's a natural.
Mr. Beaumont, we have to resolve this as quickly as possible.
Our policy provides for a $10 million payout.
I don't expect we'll pay that much, Ms. Bloom.
Avoiding violence is our top priority, Ms. Bloom.
And saving her company money.
Well, at the moment, the hostage takers haven't asked for anything at all.
So, what do they want?
That's what we need to find out.
Will you excuse us?

It's an honor, Mr. Beaumont, but I'm afraid there isn't much for you to do here.
You still haven't made contact with the hostage takers.
Zip.
And I've got every news crew on the Eastern seaboard parked outside, plus the Mayor's demanding updates every 15 minutes, so...
Have you identified them?
This is your show, Commander.
I'm just here to help in any way I can.
Sure.
Zachary Smith, 32, served six years for the Brooklyn West heist.
Six years.
Four bank tellers were executed in cold blood.
Yeah, his accomplice took the fall, but we think he was just following Smith's orders... a nasty piece of work.
And what about the second man?
Theodore Grimes... formerly one of New York's finest.
He served four years for taking bribes from a meth dealer in Castle Hill.
Okay, so robbing banks during business hours isn't exactly Grimes' M.O.
No, but it is Smith's, and they spent 18 months together in the same cell block in Attica.
We saw SWAT outside.
We can't bypass the alarms on the windows and doors, but they found access through a vent in the basement.
Take it from me... you got a homicidal ex-con in there, detective.

Someone's bound to die if they don't.

Smith is your textbook sociopath, which suggests that our ex-cop Grimes is the decision-maker.
I think you were right.
This must have been his plan all along.
Locking himself in the bank with the whole world watching doesn't sound like much of a plan.
Well, if you're not willing to negotiate, he must feel he's in a position of power.
But why take the hostages if he didn't want something?
The question is what.
They're in a bank.

Money's not much good if they can't get it out.
Hostages buy them time.
Shooting one doesn't.
Yeah, I don't think that was part of the plan.
Erratic behavior does befit a sociopath.
We need to establish contact.
- How?

Oliver:

But not their smart watches.
I noticed in the video... that security guard who was shot, he's wearing a smart watch.
♪
[Computer beeps]
But Nina would have put a cellphone jammer in place.
That's what stops hostage takers from making outside calls.
I know what a jammer is.
A smart watch would be tethered to a cellphone, so its signal would be blocked, too.
Not necessarily.
They operate on different frequencies.

Personal area networks operate at 2.4 to 2.485 gigahertz, well above the cellphone frequency you were jamming.
I was able to pair my phone with the injured guard's smart watch, and I found out they set some wire in the basement.

Those men would be dead if you hadn't.
Well, they're not, Commander, and now we may be able to save the other lives.
But Smith and Grimes have made it pretty clear they don't want to talk to us.
Well, we don't need to talk to them.
Angela Rose, that security guard... she can.
She's hardly a negotiator.
Eric can coach her on what to say, Nina.
Right, but I need to talk to her.
I need you to lift that jammer just long enough to establish a dedicated signal.
I do that, and all the hostage's cellphones start jangling with messages from worried loved ones.

Well, at 8 years old, she lost her mother to cancer.
Father was a cop, died last year.
Graduated from City College with a B.A. in English.
Unmarried, two dogs.
How long has she been a security guard?
Three years.
She trained to be a cop, but dropped out of the police academy after six months.
Because?
It doesn't say, but for three years, this woman has been locked in a dark room staring at TV monitors.
My guess... not a people person.
Why the sudden interest in Ms. Rose?
Well, we can't talk to the hostage takers, but she can.
I see.

Well, Bill Winks has a matter of hours until he bleeds to death, and there's a bunch of innocent people locked inside with a known hostage-executing psychopath.

She's already saved the lives of a number of your men.
If we help her, I think she can save a lot more, but not if your men go in guns blazing.
Okay, Beaumont.

Commissioner, SWAT is standing by, and we have a wounded man who needs medical treatment or he's gonna die.

Mr. Beaumont, I have a question.
A shift in latency, rise in the pitch of a voice... those are signs of discomfort with the situation, aren't they?
Why do you ask, Ms. Carlson?
Because Ms. Bloom's voice did both those things when Ms. Denard asked her for the list of names.
I noticed it too, but that's not surprising, is it?
She's under a lot of pressure.
Our ex-cop, Grimes... he went to prison for taking bribes from a meth dealer.

Uh, got commendations in '06 and '07, and...
What?
...May 2008, he shot a 17-year-old kid in the Bronx.

You think Eric can cope with it?

You got something.
I had to unseal records from the internal investigation.
How did you know that there was a connection between Teddy Grimes and Elizabeth Bloom?
I knew it the moment I saw her name on that list.
Ms. Bloom is a real estate developer, whose many projects include the tenement where that teenager was shot in 2008.
It seems the security camera was operating that night, but the tape went missing.
I'm guessing Ms. Bloom isn't the only name to come up in that internal investigation.
In his testimony,
Grimes claimed that he was alone in the squad car.
But Commissioner Fletcher was his superior officer at the time and on duty that night.
We think Fletcher shot that kid and made Grimes take the fall.
The missing tape would prove it.
That's quite a valuable tape.
Ms. Bloom may have been using it all these years to blackmail Commissioner Fletcher... special treatment.
And now that Grimes is out of prison, he figures he can blackmail both of them.
No surprise Grimes thought he could take all these hostages and still walk away.

You know, we could pick up Evie together, open a bottle of wine at Carlo's just like old times.
You're really good at what you do, Mr. Beaumont.
Why, thank you, Mrs. Beaumont.
Maxine hero-worships you, of course.
Well, the young lady wants to learn.
I'm happy to teach her.
I know who her mother is, and she may not be as stable as you think given her family history.
Are you questioning me?
I thought I was the best at what I did.
Be careful, Eric.
Is that love and affection that I hear?
Of course it is.
You're impossible to be married to, but you're still the father of our daughter and the best man I've ever known.
