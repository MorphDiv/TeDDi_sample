Sir.
Sir, wake up.
Sir, hello?
Sir, I need you to wake up.
Sir!
Wake the fuck up!
Hey!
Sir, how you doing this morning?
What's your name?
Sir, do you have a driver's license?
Identification?
Kulina.
Sir, we need to see a driver's license.
Yeah.

Gun!

- Do not fucking move!

- I got a...

I got a fucking permit for the gun!
- Alvey Kulina.

I fucking train you guys.

Do not speak unless I ask you to.
- I train you guys.

Lieutenant Steve Valdez will vouch for me... vouch for me.
Jesus.

Jesus Christ.
You're fucking breaking my arm, yo.
Any available units, in the 400 block of Venice Boulevard, please respond to shots fired outside the bar.

It's okay!

No.

He's good.

Thank you, sir.
You guys are fucking rough.
Sir, in the future, we can't have you sleeping on the beach, all right?
Aah!
Sorry about the gun.
You know, it's dangerous.

Why don't you guys come down to the gym?

Thank you.

Congratulations.
Feel better.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Hey, have a good day, all right?
Have a good one, sir.
Hey.

You want this?
All right.
Want this?
No?

There you go.
All right.

All right.
It is rough out there.
- Russell.

Lindsay.

I was way the hell out in Whittier.
Hope you guys weren't here too long.
Half an hour.
I really do apologize, but the market is...
It's whitehot right now, as I'm sure you know.
Getting drawn and quartered like a French heretic.
Not that I'm complaining.
And neither should you guys.

Jay, this isn't what we talked about.
Well, I think a lot of times in real estate, it's about managing expectations.
Now, this is the first time this house has been shown.
This is the first showing.
So, if you like it, we should write up an offer today.
It's kind of a dump.
Well...
Or... it's the worst house on the best street.
And that's real estate.
That's what the pros are really after.
You know, suckers...

And you're no sucker.

My apologies.
Um...
Tenants were not supposed to be here.
And, I'm definitely gonna straighten this out.
Why don't you take a look at the kitchen?
And remember, this is about good bones, right?
This is cosmetic, just a paintandvacuum sort of...
Who the fuck are you?

Good morning...

Jay Kulina, Cornwell Properties.

Get the fuck out of my house.
Not your house.

And per your lease agreement, you are supposed to vacate when we are showing the house.
I don't give a shit.
Furthermore, you are to leave the house in an orderly manner on days that we are showing the property.
What are you gonna do about it?
California, dickhead.

You can't do shit.
Or am I, wrong about that?
No.
No.
No.
You have rights.
Well, then, quit violating them and get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out.

They go?
Fuck.
Aah.
It's a job like any other, man.
I'm just here to work a shift, punch in, whip his ass, punch out, go home, have a beer, get a good night's sleep.
All in a day's work.
No malice, just...
You know, Anderson's a good dude.
He's just gonna have a very, very bad night, but it's... it's not about hate.
That's not my nature.
People in my life will tell you
I'm...

I believe in a...

Yeah, it's been a great year...

Um, but it is... it is my last fight with King Beast Promotions.
Contract's up.
I feel like I've been a good soldier.

I'm getting paid like a fucking migrant but that's fine.
Well, I mean, every fighter wants to fight in the UFC.
Definitely love another shot at that.

Jesus Christ.

He's frustrated, and so am I.
- What can I do?

- I'll make him a verbal offer.

So you can shop it.
Has the UFC made an offer?
- We're talking.

And I know for a fact the UFC will not make an offer unless he wins tonight, so you have no leverage.
Okay.

Lisa.
You trust me?
- Sure.

I've been approached by some people from Dubai.
I mean, I'm talking about oil money.
And they want to take King Beast, and they want to turn it into a major promotion.
Good luck with that.
Of course.

Garo, the UFC will swallow it up.
Promotions come and go.
Garo, there's no one onstage.
Okay, give me a...

These guys are real, okay?
And they love the sport, and they have money, and they have a plan, and I want Ryan to be a part of it.
Just promise me... just don't do anything with the UFC until you let me make my pitch.
When?
Monday.

- Monday?

Don't go dark on me, all right?
Just come by later, and we'll talk.
Bring your food.
- I'll...

How you feeling, big guy?
Holy shit.
What the fuck happened last night?
You won Coach of the Year.
Yeah.

To quote you, you were.
"Winston fucking Churchill up there."
I got to apologize to anybody?
No.

What time did you leave?
Around 1:00.

What's up?

Yeah.

They love him?

I know.

He said that he was gonna come by and see you later.
No.

I got to find Nate.

Hey, hey, hey!
What?
Was I a pig?
Not to me, you weren't.

Fuck me.
No, the breakdown said,
"Trustfund, sexpot, Burning Man neophyte."
What?

Early 20's, which I'm not, obviously.
MMaybe we should just use the one where my hair is back.
Yeah.
I'll get new pictures.
Okay.
Well, let me know if you hear anything.
Okay.

Hey.
Aww.

- She cried the whole time.

- I checked her diaper.

It's all good.

Really good.

Did she eat anything?
I gave her a bottle, yeah.

- Yes.

Thank you again.
Say, "Bye."
Bye, Maya.

Bowl of ice and a towel, please.
Juan, glove up. 30 minutes.
Yeah.

Congrats on your award.
Yeah.

Um, can I get you some Pedialyte?
Fruit punch.

Shelby, how you feeling?
Great.
- Yeah?

It's kicking around a lot.
That's a good sign.
- Yeah, I think so.

Do you need anything else?
- No.

Don't work too hard, all right?
I never do.
No.

I mean, you know, you need some time off, you just let me know, okay?
It's paid.

Thank you.
You're welcome.
Russell, Jay Kulina calling, trying you again.
I think I have another property that you will love.
Actually, scratch that.
I know you're gonna love it.

Well, look at this.
We have the en suite in the master that your wife, um, Lindsay, wanted so much.
Anyway, give me a call, and I can show it today.
Um, and I just want to apologize about this morning.
I was mortified, frankly.

Um, so, give me a call at the office or on my cell.
- Dan, sir, how you doing?

I just got to say, right off the bat, you look like a goddamn pit boss in that suit.
That's great.

Okay, so, what...

- Excuse me?

You were just apologizing on the phone.
- So, what happened at Culver?

The...

Dude, you can't show a place with the tenants there.

I totally agree, and... and I wasn't...
Then why did you fucking show it?
I had spoken to the tenants...- multiple times, and they assured me that they weren't gonna be in the home.
- But they were.

Right.

Yes, sir.

9:00 a.m. 9:00 a.m. What time did you get there?
- About 9:00.

Real...

If the showing's at 9:00, you get there at 8:30.

That way, you can enter the property and make sure that everything looks good, it's nice and tidy, there's no tenant fucking jerking off on the couch.
- That's common sense, okay?

Right?

I completely understand what you're saying.

And I'll be doing that moving forward.
Good.

Attention to detail.
I need you to dial it in, man, all right?
- Yes, sir.

You know, he's a tough kid, heavy hands, um, definitely, dangerous.
But I'm up for the challenge.
"Pretty boy"?

He said that?

- I mean, am I pretty?

I like to think of myself more as a... as a handsome man, I think.
Um, but I'll take it as a compliment.
I think we should ask him again after the fight, though.
See what happens.
My dad's one of the best coaches in... in the game.
Um, and, you know, we got a lot of killers at the gym.
Um, and then, you know, as far as Jay goes,
I'd love to see him fight again.
I think...

He's one of the most exciting fighters out there, I think.
I might be biased.
Um, but there are bigger things than fighting.
And, you know, right now he's doing what he's got to do, and I support him either way.
Okay?

Wakin' in the dawn of day
I gotta think about what I wanna say.
Phone ringing' off the shelf Watch that jab.
I guess he wanted to kill himself.
Wakin' on a pretty day.
Don't know why I ever go away.
It's hard to explain Come on!
My love in this daze.
You can say I've been most all around.
But, honey, I ain't goin' nowhere.
Don't worry 'bout a thing.
It's only dying.
I live along a straight line.
Nothin' always comes to mind.
To be frank, I'm fried.
But I don't mind.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeahyeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
How'd your audition go?
It was humiliating.
I was 10 years older than everyone.
Well, just...
You don't need that.
I mean, why would you do something that... doesn't make you happy, you know?
Because we could use the money.
I think maybe you should let this caveman venture out into the world and hunt, provide for this family like the good will of God intended.
All right, well, when Daddy sells houses, then we can talk about that.
That's not a very nice thing to say.
Well, you got to toughen up.
- Yeah?

You got a daughter watching you now, Kulina.
All right!

Aah!
Fuck you, guy.
Fuck!

You good?
I feel it.

- There he is...

- I know.

- Yeah.

Not now!
That's it.

No more poison.
Feel better?
Kudos on the award last night.
Coach of the Year...

You seem down.
I'm not down.
Well, you're not up.
About what?
The fucking award, winning a trophy?
That's all bullshit.

Everything's all bullshit.

But it's still nice to win a trophy?
Why?

You know want to know what's better than winning a trophy?
A blowjob.
A belt.
I'm offering you a fight.
What are you talking about?
I want to do a legends fight.
Legends?

Two old guys fucking slapping each other around for three rounds?
That's a legends fight.

No, thank you.

Well, I ain't young.
I got money.
You got fucking money like I got money.
Arabs.
Arabs?
Arabs.
How much?
Well, I would never tell you that, but once everything is done, we're gonna do a big launch, and the kids need to see who put this sport on the map.
I know you have another fight in you, Alvey.
I can smell it in your loins.
Get out of here.

You have to take a shower?

Please.
- You're so gay.

- Get out.

But, for real, think about what I said because I know you got another fight in you.
- I know you do.

Alvey Kulina, one more time.
Bapbap!

Ladies and gentlemen, he's back, the legend!
Whoo!
- How'd it go out there?

Are you taking your food somewhere?
Yep.

Business.
If your food is here, why doesn't she just come over?
Because... we're talking business, Keith.
You got the place to yourself.
Enjoy the quiet.
I'm sick of the quiet.
Good God.

Stop looking at that fucking website, man.
What these people are doing to me is a war crime.
They give out our exact address.
It just sucks 'cause people hate sex offenders, and now they have my location.
It's like I'm a fish in a barrel.
Hey, I promise you, nobody looks at this shit, okay?
Vigilantes do.

You're making yourself crazy.
Will you just relax?
Try to relax.
All right.

My God.
He's supposed to register as a sex offender.
He didn't.
They put him on house arrest.
And I kept fucking reminding him.

Okay, but it's not like rape.

Doesn't matter.

Poor Keith.
- Poor Keith?

Poor fucking fruit.
I got to start looking for my own place.
- No, Ryan, you can't.

He'll kill himself.
I don't want to live with a sex offender.
He's your friend.
Okay.
- That's not fair, okay?

Am I supposed to have this guy with me for the rest of my life?
I can't do that, Lisa.
And, you know, aat some point, he's a fucking grown man.
You're right.

You've lasted a fuck of a lot longer than I would have.
Anyway...
I should be able to afford something nice... with all this money that you're gonna get me.
I'm working on it.
Anything from UFC?
They want to wait until after tomorrow night.
What about Garo?

Yeah.

If I lose, it's gonna be a lot less money.
It's gonna be another shit contract.
And if you win, it will be a lot more, and that I can shop with the UFC.
If I do lose, then there's gonna be no leverage.
Ryan, will you fucking bet on yourself?
If I had any doubt, I would close this deal tonight.
I promise you.
You're gonna win.
I hate this shit.
God.

Go home.

- Seriously?

You're acting like you suddenly have fucking manners?
There he is.
- Clean that shit.

Thank you.

You fuck.
Aah!
Morning.

Steelcut, no sugar, bland as fuck.
Yeah.

- Thank you.

I'm heading into the office.
Then I've got a client dinner... unless you want me at the fight.
Yeah.

Um, I nearly forgot.
Here.
What's this?
It's a key.

Relax.
It's just easier for nights that you want to be here.
Okay.
Got it.
Text me when it's over, yeah?
Yeah.
Nate... knock the fucker out.
I'll try.
Right.

That's good.
Good.

Play with what we played with.

Good.

You're too tense.

- Just flick it.

So, if I'm getting out of the way of that right...
Sweet right.
Watch that.

Keep him moving.

And now come out with your hands.
Block.

Good, good, good.
Nice.
Good.
- Feel good?

You nervous?
Hey, don't worry about the fucking contract, all right?
Don't chase the money.

You're a fucking savage.

- Jesus Christ, Alvey.

- Come on.

- What do you mean, I stink?

9:00 in the fucking morning.

Fucking...
Good work.
Always moving, always moving.
Yep.
Is it hard for you to go to these?
- The fight?

- No.

- No, ma'am.

I'd rather dip my dick in honey and thrust it into an anthill.
Are you staring at me?
No, I'm not staring.

It's understandable.
There's a lot of nice things to look at you probably like.
What do you think it is...

That you're too sensitive for this world.
I am gonna go say good evening to our girl.
She's asleep.
I'll be home early.
- No rush.

Tell Nate good luck.
He was fine at the weighing.
Yeah, I bet.

He wouldn't...

It's very, very unprofessional.
I promise you this... he'll never fight for me again... never.
Yeah.

Fuck you.
FFuck!
Motherfucker!

I am here with Jay Kulina.
Jay, first of all, congratulations on your baby girl.
Thanks so much, Kenny.

So, II got to ask you... is Jay Kulina changing diapers now?
Because I find that kind of hard to imagine.
I do it all.

I got bottles and diapers.
I'm singing and slinging lullabies in multiple octaves.
- You want to sing one right now?

All right.

You guys are 11.
I know the fans would love to see a third fight.
Well, Ryan's having a phenomenal year, as I think this whole audience can tell you.
And I'm excited to be here supporting him and my brother, Nate Kulina, out of Navy St. Gym.
But don't you feel like there's unfinished business here?
I'm...

You know, I think life... life...

WWhy not a rematch?

There's no holdup.

So, nobody's talking?

I'm focused on being a father right now, um, to be honest, and, I'm...
I'm loving every minute of it.
All right.

But setting a Wheeler fight aside, are we ever gonna see Jay Kulina in the cage again?
I don't know.

I'm excited about what I'm doing right now and being a father, um, and I don't see that situation changing at anytime soon.
Jay, thank you.

Always great to see you.
And, there you have it, folks... a domesticated Jay Kulina playing it very close to the vest.
Hey.
I'm not talking to you until after the fight.
It's about Nate.

Dixon pulled out of the fight.
- Garo, what the fuck?

No, Garo, what the fuck?

What's two hours?
- Go ahead, Garo.

Tell Alvey and Nate.
Dixon pulled out of the fight.
- What?

His manager said that he's sick.
That's bullshit.

Look, I've...

We're gonna find a good replacement for you.
Listen to me, Nate...

No.

- I want to fucking fight.

You're not fighting.

Just get your shit together and let us deal with this.
You suck at your job.
And you're fucking paying him his purse.
I'm gonna pay him the show money...
No, you're fucking paying him!

You're full of shit!

Shit happens.

Look, you cannot take a fight with two hours' notice.

I know.

You're gonna get paid.
We're gonna find you a fight.

Go get something to eat.
Lord, please clear my head of all distractions and my heart of all burdens I may bear so I may perform my very best, knowing you'll always be there.
With great courage, Lord,
I will meet this challenge, as you would have me to.
Keep me humble, Lord, and remind me that my strength comes from knowing you.
Jesus.

And...

- Jesus Christ.

- Let's go.

- Wake me up!

- Wake me up!

Get your money, motherfucker.

- Aah!

- Savage!

Run on for a long time.
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down.
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down.
Go tell that longtongue liar.
Go and tell that midnight rider.
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter.
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down.
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down.
Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news.
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee.
Talkin' to the man from Galilee.
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of the angels' feet.
He called my name, and my heart stood still.
When he said, "John, go do my will".
Come on, Wheeler!
All right, gentlemen.

Protect yourself at all times.

Touch gloves now if you want.

At the sound of the bell, come on out and handle your business.
Let's go.
Go!

Stay on him!

Anderson, get over here.
Neutral corner.

Stay right there, right there.

All right.

- Shake it off!

- Pick it up.

- Stand up!

Here.

- No, I'm...

- I'm ready to fuck him up.

All right.
That's it, Ryan!

You ready?

Come on, Wheeler!
- Come on, Ryan!

Keep moving!

Come on, Wheeler!

Aah!
Bullshit!
- Yeah!

Ryan!

That's a fucking point!
Come on.

He's gonna talk to you, okay?

Hey.

You should take a point, Mike!
- Catch me.

- I just...

Yeah.

Right here.
Let me see your eyes.

- You good?

Intentionally kneeing the head of a grounded opponent!
2 points!

Take your time!

All right, you ready to go?
Yes?

Circle left!

Find your way!

10 seconds, Wheeler!

Hands up!
Ice.
Ice.
No more fucking banging with this guy, right?
No more banging.

I want you to take him down, and I want you to fucking finish this, all right?
He's hanging his fucking hand out there.
Shoot him.

Shoot on him, take him down, and fucking finish him.
Let's get out of here.

All right, gentlemen, second round!
You ready to fight?

Come on!

Circle left!

First of all, all praise to Jesus.
Without him, none of this is possible.
Amen.
Um, yeah, man, crazy, right?
II guess...

It was a stunning, violent finish.
What was the difference in the second round?
Well, once he finished kicking me in the balls and, kneeing me while I was down,
I guess he ran out of stuff to do.
And then I just threw him on the ground and gave him a gentleman's beating.
It's your last fight on your contract.
What's next?
Milliondollar question.

Like I said, he's the guy that...
- Shit.

Yeah, well, you know, Lisa and I...

I'm gonna...

Like any professional fighter, I want to be paid market value, so we're gonna be testing the limits of that.
But listen.

II've enjoyed my time here.

It's been a privilege and an honor to fight in front of you.
Thank you, Alvey, Lisa, Joe, Navy St., everybody.
And, thank you guys for watching.
Thank you.
As if they couldn't have found you another fight at the last minute.
Have they at least promised you another fight soon?
No.
- You getting paid?

What does your contract say?
There must be some language in there that...
I don't care about the fucking money.
Lisa will figure it out.

I'm on your side, Nate.
I'm not trying to get in your business.
Beer?
Actually, I'm gonna go.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
We're fine, okay?
I trained three months for a fight.
I don't want to have one with you.
Understood.
Thank you.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

What are you up to now?
Smoke this and go home.
That's a plan.
We should talk about Nate tomorrow.
Garo's gonna pay him.
Well.
That's the least he could fucking do.
He offered me a fight.
All this money that he's getting, he wants to do a legends fight.
It's fucking dumb?
Are you gonna do it?
I'm thinking about it.
What are you thinking?
I think it's up to you.
- You don't have an opinion?

No.

My brain's not fucked up that way.
If I do it, if I train, we got to hire somebody else to pick up the slack.
I'll train Nate and Ryan, but we can afford that?
I'll get into it tomorrow, but do you really want to fight?
Yeah, I think so, one more time.
Be good.
I want you to handle it with Garo, yeah?
I'm on it.
All right.
Don't smoke that whole thing.
Thanks, Dad.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

Sorry.
Hey.
Nate came home early.
His fight fell apart.
Shit.

Hey.

We can't fall asleep with her.
I won't.
I think we should baptize her.
Why?
Just in case.
Just in case.
