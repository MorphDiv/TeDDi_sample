Most people who eat Komodo dragons throw away the testicles.
I guess those people hate electrolytes.
[crunch]
Sure, he's a bit over the top, but Aaron Wolf's a legit badass.
Yeah, last week he slept inside an elephant's uterus.
Ooh, what I wouldn't give to be that elephant.
I hate Aaron Wolf.
These fake survival shows are ruining it for hardcore adventurers like us.
You won't find testes like these in your mama's pantry.
Unless, of course, she's a member of the Aaron Wolf Extreme Meat of the Month Club.
Oh, this guy is such an embarrassment.
I guarantee I could stuff way more testicles in my mouth.
Didn't you used to work with Aaron?
Yeah, we started here at Outdoor Limits together.
In fact, I was one of the first people in the world to not respect his work.
Sounds like you're just jealous he got out while you're still working here in your late 50s.
How old do you think I am?
Aw, he's already going deaf.
Eh, looks like I dribbled a little bit of dragon seed on my shirt.
I guess I'll have to forage for a new one over at my Web site...
"WheresWolfTV.biz/store/apparel/tops"
[baying like a wolf]
Oh, this guy uses any excuse to take off his shirt.
Not true, he always has a legit reason.
I'm sure K-pop superstar Tae-Twon Park would agree that's some fresh salmon.
[both howling]
Jack, we're watching it.
I don't know who I'm more disappointed in, you guys or Tae-Twon Park.
Jack, I'm sorry to butt in.
You couldn't come to my office, could you?
I seem to have misplaced a rare South-Asian gem.
A sapphire... possibly from Bombay.
Ah, gin, how quickly you turn a mother's hug into a vicious slap.
It's like some evil scientist said,
"I'll invent a liquid to ruin every Thanksgiving."
Now, Jack, you know I value your opinion above anyone else's.
Now, I'm considering asking Aaron Wolf to come in and guest-edit the magazine for a week.
What do you think?
You see, heh,
I wanted you to feel important, so I only pretended to seek your input.
Aaron Wolf is coming to guest-edit the magazine this week.
No, you can't do that.
I finally have the kids writing the best stories of their lives.
One week with Aaron, and they'll be back to churning out articles like "Bears Ain't That Bad, Yo."
Oh, come on, you two used to be friends.
You teamed up on some of our best pieces, and, if I recall, one of our hottest copywriters.
Well, that was before he sold out.
He doesn't care about the outdoors.
All he cares about is his Aaron Wolf brand.
You taught me this magazine is about integrity and substance, and day-drinking.
That's why it's your responsibility to make sure that Aaron upholds the standards of the magazine.
But I respect you, Jack, and if you really are against this idea, I'll call it off.
Great, call it off.
[howling in next room]
He's already here, isn't he?
Why can't you just agree and feel important?
You know, Brooke, I remember when you were just an intern here.
But I've got to say, you have blossomed into one righteous slam piece.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No paper towels, amigo.
We've got to take care of this righteous chica we call Mother Earth.
Allow me.
[eagle screeches]
♪ [phone ringing]
And that was when I realized,
I didn't have to outrun the bear,
I just had to outrun celebrity chef Mario Batali.
[laughter]
Ugh, this guy hasn't changed a bit.
Yeah, he's such a poser.
I hope he dies in a fiery boat accident.
Whoa, dude.
Look, the guy's a clown, but he has a daughter.
I hope he gets a back rub that's so good it only leaves him wanting more.
That's not far enough.
I hope he gets his on the head and forgets the names of everyone he loves?
There you go.
Ugh, I couldn't live with myself if I was that much of a phony.
Hey, buddy.
Jack Gordon.
Jack knows me by my birth name, before I was renamed by the Choctaw Nation.
Yeah, we all had fun at that casino opening.
Hey, there's that grip that free-climbed El Capitan.
And there's that hand that once got stuck inside a water buffalo.
Ooh, that is one lucky water buffalo.
Man, it's great to be here.
This place made me who I am.
I'm sorry, what?
Your reflux, your reflux.
Look, as managing editor, I should probably walk you through some of the ideas
First things first.
Let's all do this at Eddie's, all right?
My publicist scored a same-day rez.
Howl if you're with me.
[howling]
He's already got Emma and Mason howling.
That's what I was worried about.
You say the word, I will bring back his trachea.
You've really got to work on your levels.
Congrats on your show.
The way you roasted termite larvae with the Massai warriors inspired me to rethink my whole menu.
So let me tell you guys how badass your boss is.
Tell 'em about the time the two of you went glacier trekking in the Himalayas.
I used to be clinically obese.
So ten years ago, a TV producer came in and asked Jack if he wanted to host his own adventure show.
Well, when Mr. Integrity here turned it down, guess who they offered it to next?
That's right, Seth Green.
And then when he turned it down, that's when they asked me to do it.
And, trust me, I have no problem feasting on Jack's sloppy seconds.
Oh, my.
Guys, obviously, Jack made the right choice.
He's making a real difference in the world.
So what if he's sleeping in the second-best bedroom above a filthy bar with his roommate who's constantly heating canned tuna?
Well, now I regret my life.
Aaron, look, I'm sure you're late for some celebrity appearance at a boat show...
Oh, crap, you're right.
So why don't we fill you in on some of the pieces we're working on this week?
Okay, all right, so what we want are some hot, sexy ideas that our sponsors can really get behind.
Okay, howl at me.
Okay, well, there's a caribou migration in the Yukon... it's supposed to be epic.
[smooches]
Mm, no, I don't want to have sex with that idea.
I'm sorry.
Who's next?
Uh, there's a fisherman in Brazil who survived 30 days lost in the Amazon.
Okay, okay, hold on.
[chuckles, smooches]
You know what, soft as a hacky sack.
Okay, Aaron, these are good ideas that you are having air sex with.
I have worked hard to get these kids to write articles with real substance.
Oh, man, that's why you're always gonna be a better writer than me, you know?
Okay, look, so tomorrow, we're all gonna reconvene on Mason's Yukon idea, okay?
And I promise that I'm personally gonna turn it into a respectable, sophisticated idea that we all want to bend over a car.
[elevator bell chimes]
Hey, Esther, how you doing?
I had that dream again where I'm a weird receptionist at an outdoor magazine.
And then what happened?
Oh, thank God you're here.
Look what this greasy Disney villain did to our Web site.
[wolf howls]
Oh, it looks like a Hong Kong street corner.
I read you loud and clear, guys.
That's why I sent Emma and Mason up to the Yukon to report on that caribou story.
That's a green screen.
Or there are two Esthers in the world.
Either way, it's a waking nightmare.
Aaron is a disaster.
First, he paid for everyone's lunch, which sets a terrible precedent.
And now he's infecting everyone with his low standards.
[laughs] Oh, this is like old times...
Jack complaining about Aaron.
Do you remember that time you stormed in because he wanted to add a centerfold to the magazine?
I don't even know where he found that photo, but an Amelia Earhart nip-slip was in poor taste.
Well, Jack, if you're worried about Aaron leading these kids astray, then you need to remind them what the magazine stands for.
How am I supposed to do that?
Well, are you familiar with the legend of how the British dealt with the cobra problem in colonial India?
And I'm halfway through this book all about it.
So why don't you sort out your own problems for a change, hmm?
So the green screen is free for you to do your "Wolf It Down" segment on how to find food in the forest.
Guys, we are not about faking stuff.
It's called Outdoor Limits because we actually inspire people to go outside.
And Outside Magazine was already taken.
Look, hey, guys, if you want maximum eyeballs,
Except for Space Jam, hands down the best basketball cartoon movie of all time.
Reminds me of a story.
The year was 2007.
We were halfway up Mount...
As you can see, it's taking a while because of these wet conditions, but we have seen some amazing wildlife out here.
Like a brown squirrel, a grey squirrel and a third squirrel who was moving too fast for me to tell exactly what color it was.
Bee-oop!
Hey, Jack.
We all know Aaron's a basic B, bordering a C, but, uh, when he does his "Wolf It Down" segments, there's a little more action.
This is primal.
Man versus wet stick.
Listen, I could watch you rub your wet stick all night long.
But it's just that we promised our viewers a bug feast, and after four hours, the only people still watching are... my mom and some guy from Texas who keeps demanding to see our bare feet.
Look, it's the authenticity that's gonna make people excited about all this.
You want to maybe take your shirt off?
No!
[exhales]
What up, Mom and GimmeDemFeet72?
Watch out, because C-dawg's gonna get to the bottom of... this.
It's like putting a subway station in my mouth.
That's how you make a real fire in the wild.
Gradually.
[retching]
Hey, Wolf Cubs, how's the QA coming?
These fifth graders in Canada want to know how I'm liking the Yukon, but I'm obviously not there.
Can't lie to a bunch of kids.
Mason, Mason, Mason.
Kids are the easiest ones to lie to.
And in public school?
In Canada?
It's just that we can't get Jack's stupid voice out of our heads: "Write with purpose,"
"Beyoncé's not a source."
It's so annoying.
I definitely know that voice: "Do your research,"
"You take the mom, I'll take the daughter."
Look, I understand what you guys are saying.
But munch on this.
Your jazzed-up Yukon story is getting international buzz.
The guy rubbing sticks together?
Two followers.
The bug buffet didn't really work out, so Jack set up a trap to show us how to catch game.
Luckily, this forest boasts a cornucopia of delicious fruits.
Clark, we got something!
Remember, no matter the size, even a trapped animal can be dangerous.
It's not a rabbit, Jack, it's a pussum.
Do you mean "possum"?
Oh, that pussum got me good.
Clark, do you think there's a chance that you're pronouncing it wrong?
Okay, look, this is not staged.
There's no emergency crew standing by.
It's real...
Are you bleeding out of the mouth?
Oh, God.
Okay, I need something to make a tourniquet for your wound, so I can focus on figuring out how to pump your stomach.
Damn it.
Hit record, Mom.
[sighs]
What up, work puss-e?
He means work posse.
Well, we did it our way, and while we weren't as successful as we had hoped...
Any more to that thought, Jack?
It was pretty bad, wasn't it?
No matter what Pearl Jam Professor Snape tried to tell us.
Let's take a look at the trailer they put together.
This fall, on Nat Geo...
I just got bit by the pussum.
One question will be asked.
Will he die this week?
What kind of a simple-minded fool would enjoy that?
Oh, my God, that show looks hilarious!
But Clark, you do know it's pronounced "possum," right?
Are you guys pranking me?
Now say "possum."
Pussum.
Hey, Jack.
Look.
You know I respect the schnizz out of your principles.
But I'm not gonna let you make the same mistake you made ten years ago.
I am just glad that Emma and Mason weren't here to see this.
Oh, they saw it, and they went crazy about it.
I've never seen them so fired up.
Well, other than that time I pointed out what a pay phone looks like,
I have officially taught them nothing.
So what do you say, Jack?
When are you gonna get it through that dirty janitor's mop that Jack Gordon will never sell out?
I'm gonna do the show.
If I can't even get Emma and Mason to like the outdoors, let alone the rest of the world, why not just abandon my ideals and get rich?
Bro.
That's my motto.
What about authenticity?
Authenticity?
Check out the two reporters
"broadcasting" from the same room
Esther felt me up in at the Christmas party.
Jack, if I've told you once, I've told you a hundred times.
I was just trying to touch your penis.
Well, at least they've gotten more convincing at shivering.
Jack, I think they might actually be in the Yukon.
Nah, if they were, they'd be complaining it's cold as balls.
And it's cold as balls!
That's not what Outdoor Limits is about.
The caribou are so beautiful, I can't even.
It is so bleak.
We found a frozen corpse still locked upright in his cross-country skis.
But when you do come up here, do not wear these yoga pants, because they're trash.
Garbage.
Need some more of this stuff.
Oh, my God.
I have had an impact on them.
They've learned journalistic integrity.
And as a bonus, they're miserable.
Aaron, I'm sorry.
I can't do the show.
Even though you reach a lot more people, the work we're doing here is important.
Wow.
I want to get your integrity pregnant.
Yeah, but I'm not married.
You sure about this?
Yeah, he's sure about it, bro.
You know what, I don't care if you do have a daughter.
It is clobbering time.
It was, wasn't it?
You know, I know we have our differences, but in a way, it's cool that we found a path for each of us.
[grunts]
The Choctaw Nation was right about you.
You're okay.
It's time to go to sleep, guy.
The Sandman is here.
Can we make plans?
Come here.
All right, I'm gonna go grab an apple for the road.
[straining] [howls]
I know what you did, you sly son of a bitch.
Hiding behind your book the entire time Aaron Wolf was here.
Well, I read your little story about the cobras in India.
And when the British interfered, they only made it worse.
And so the lesson was, sometimes, the best way to solve a problem is to leave it alone.
And that's exactly what you did, didn't you?
Yes, that s-sounds exactly like what I did.
You're absolutely right, Jack.
Now I want you to go across the street, get me a mocha Frappuccino and know, the whole time, that it's all part of an important, hidden lesson.
[exhales sharply, giggles]
