Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha
-Seven billion people were killed in the last Great War.
Not all at once, though.
It takes time to wipe out an entire species .
We are the survivors.
Some say we were the lucky ones.
But when I was a kid,
My mother used to tell me stories about what life was like back then, before the radiation,
before the plague, before the drought.
At first, I didn't believe her.

Now that there only are few of us left, something has become clear to me..
We have a choice.
We can either carve out a new future for ourselves on the tombstone of this dying planet,
or go back to that fairy tale.
And try again.
-Are you folks lost?
-Is this the way to get to Piccadilly Circus ?
-You're too late.

-Well, I guess we'll have to come back yesterday, before they're all gone.
-Welcome to The Domes.
-Thank you.

-Higgs, you got some visitors.
-Where have you been?

-They've all set up road blocks.
We had to take the not so scenic route.
If we hurry we can still make it into the jump window.
-Let me get your identification, OK?
Stand still.

Agent Seattle.

-OK, follow me.
Now, this is your first jump, right?
Yes.

We don't have time for a complete debriefing,
Now, you're familiar with the NCNG protocol, I hope?
- "Nothing comes nothing goes."

Now, a few pointers.
Keep your interactions with the locals to a minimum.
That will help maintain your cover.
-Got it.
-Some changes are to be expected.

As long your results are net positive, you can consider your mission to be a success.
-Have others failed?
-We're all still here, aren't we?
Watch your step.
The first jump can be a little disorienting.
It might take a while for you to get acclimated to your new skin.
Some agents experience paranoia, delusions, psychosis.
Others, once they go into stasis they never wake up.
Lucky for you, we've worked out those bugs.
Well, most of them.
Secure your weapons up here.
Right up here.
Put your personal belongings in these baskets.
Then put the baskets back in the rack.
You can retrieve them when you come out of stasis.
There is a wash bin right here.
Wash up when you're done.
-Have you ever done this before?

-Well, we're all required to log 500 hours before we're certified, so yes.
-Any advice tor first timers?
Well...
Have you ever had those dreams where you know you're asleep, but everyone else around you thinks it's real?
Just remember who's awake.
Who's first?
I'll go.
-OK.
-Don't be a stranger.
-Let's go.
-See you on the other side.
-Right here.
-Are you ready?
-Bring it

Seriously, Ava?

-School is overrated.
- We need to talk!

-Do you think I like living like this?
Can't you see that I'm trying, Ava?

-It's not my fault you screwed up your own life and it doesn't mean you get to relive it through me.
-It never ends with you, does it?
-I guess not.
-Why are you so angry?
Whatever happened to my little girl?

-You'll get over it.
-You ungrateful little brat!

I was going to let you go out and have fun tonight, but instead you're gonna stay here and you're gonna clean up this pig sty!
-Hey!
Nice outfit.

Thanks, so do you.

Uh, he's male and has a pulse.
What do you think?
-OK, good.

-No way.

-You little slut!

-Where are you gonna do it?
I don't know.

You know, I just figured see how things work out.
-I will drink to that.
I know what you need.
A little something to take the edge off.
Just a few, or will not remember a thing, and I'm gonna want to know all the juicy details.
Well, you're not the only one who wants to have fun today.
-Hey.

-Wow, you're looking hot tonight.

-Come on, I want to show you something.

I got your beanie!
"You think you're so funny, don't you?"

-Here, give it back.

Come on.
It's much better this way.
You've had enough.
-This is mine.
Come here.
-I don't feel good.
I seriously don't feel good.
-I've got something that will make you feel better.
-Shit.

Ava!
You've had enough.
-I will drink to that.
You ungrateful little brat!
-Real nice.
-My god, Ava.

-Shit!

She was fine a few seconds ago.

-Shit.
-My God.

-My God.
-Somebody call 911!
-Matt?

Where is everyone?
Ow.
Mom!

-What now?
Look, alright, I don't need a lecture..
You know there is someone in the house and...
Just let me in, okay?
-What's the matter?
-She's right there.

-I thought I heard something at the door.
-You need to get her out!

-It better not be not one of your idiot friends.
-Can you not see me?
-Some of us have to work in the morning.
-I don't know who you think you are!
-Hello?
Is anyone there?

-Alright.
-Come on, Lancer.
Where are you?
-Get out of here!
I said get out!
-Lancer?
Is that you?

Did you miss your jump?
-Why wasn't I been informed of this breach sooner?
-It was not necessarily a breach per Se.
They boys in engineering detected a slight protuberance on the continuum.
They assured me it was just a glitch.
-Well, tell them not to think too hard.

Jeez.
Are you a gambling man, Brewer?
No.
-Hmm, "no".

Well, I am.
And I'll bet anything that the rebels have moved their stasis chambers underground to hide electromagnetic footprint..
So, it's time you stop wasting time chasing imaginary glitches and tell your boys in engineering to track down their point of origin!
-Sir, that signal was very faint.

Even if there were a time jump, the rebels couldn't have gone very far.
-I do not care if they went back five years or five minutes.
A jump causes ripples.

Sometimes I wish time travel had never been invented.
It's more trouble than it's worth.
We've got rebels popping up of every goddamned time stream.
They're like ticks.
And once they're dug into a time zone, it is impossible to root them out.
-On the plus note, last month alone,
We've cleared out rebel bases both in 97 Hong Kong and pre-9/11 New York.
-Congratulations, that's two.
How many others are out there disturbing the time stream now?
-We're working on that.
-Well, work faster!
And if you encounter any more...glitches, notify me immediately.
-Of course, sir.

-Seek Harmony.
-Oh, look at all this food.
-Oh, god, what drugs did I take last night?
-Someone's up early.
Oh, I'm sorry, here, um... let me clean this up.
Do you want any of this?
-No, I...

-Hey, need to talk to you about last night.
-Oh, about like the door bell?
No, before that.
Listen, I didn't mean to call you a brat.
-Oh, um...yeah.

-That's mature of you.
-Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day we're still family, right?
-Yeah, we are.
-Oh, for Christ's sakes.

-Listen, I gotta go to work, but we'll talk later?
-OK, Yeah, bye.
(thinking) I don't know how long I can keep this up.
-Finally!
-Hey, Ava!
Come on, babe, get in the car, I want to talk to you!
-I have somewhere else to be.
-Let me take you!

-Oh, don't be mad.

Alright?

-You know, I... don't really want to discuss this.
-Look, I said I was sorry, what more do you want from me?
-I want you to keep on driving.
-You can't get rid of me that easily.
-Look, let me put this blunt to you, guy.
Stay away.

-Fine!

-It is!
-No, Matt!

How did I get in here?
Why can't you see me?
Look, I don't know what's going on,
I'm gonna try to find out how to make it right.
-Don't be a stranger.
Excuse me, do you know the way to the Piccadilly Circus?
Too late.
They've run out of Blackbird pie.
-My God!

-Hi, Lancer.
Surprise!
Wow, you hit the jackpot.

-At some sort of fraternity hazing ritual, gone south.
you know, and I thought my vessel was young.
-Yeah, I know, drug overdose.

-I'm sorry.
I mean...that's actually sad, poor kid.
-Yeah.
So, what are you gonna do?
I don't know, I can't just leave.
Because the kid would be gone, and the mom will come searching for me.
-And create a bunch of unwanted attention.
Exactly.

I know selections are limited.

-Maybe somebody at base camp will have some ideas.

-Yeah.
-We should probably go check in.

-You folks lost or something?
-Uh, is...is this the way to Piccadilly Circus ?
-You're too late.

-We'll come back yesterday, before they're all gone.
-You must be new, I don't recognize those skins.
-Agent Lancer.
-Agent Seattle.
-Agent Derby.

-Um, we've seen worse.
-Don't get me wrong.

But I heard that the Pacific unit is in a mansion in Bel Air.
Bel Air!
Whose ass do you have to kiss to get that assignment?
We should put this on the list for the next jump..
-Let's get through this one first.
-Oh, you got stuck with a kid, huh?
Too bad.

-You can do that?
-Well, let me tell you, I've seen some really bad jumps over the years.
One vessel was decapitated in a car accident.
That was messy

-See?

-Wanna trade?
-No, thanks.
-Agent Seattle?

-I'm Captain Suthers.

We're happy to help.
How is the 21st century treating you so far?
-I can't complain, the air is clean.
-Oh, have you tried orange juice?

-Enjoy it while it lasts.
Come on, I'll give you the Nickel tour.
While some other stations are more of your typical bang and burn operation, our emphasis is on executive action.
-What is this place?
-This will give you a sense of what we're up against.
-Whoa.
-Jesus, I didn't realize that Cabal had so many operatives in this timezone
They haven't consolidated their power structures yet.
They're still hindered by national boundaries, which makes it easier for us to cut their legs off from under them.
You aren't afraid of getting your hands dirty, are you?
-Not at all.

-Who are you people?
-HQ knows we can't compete with the Cabal Uptime.
They are bigger than us and have unlimited resources.
But here downtime, it's a level playing field.
Isn't that right?
-Whoa!

This vessel is very sensitive.
-Agent Paseo will get you started with the data dump.
-The process itself is painless,
But it will give a hell of a migraine.
-Oh, oh, Captain, if it's not too much to ask, the guard mentioned the possibility of getting a replacement vessel?
This is too young for field work.
-Especially if the two of you are gonna be working together.
We don't want to raise too many questions.

-Wait, So does that mean I can I get my body back?
I'll put in a transfer request.

-What?
So, but wait, how long id it for a replacement?
Are you talking hours?

-Ladies first.
I'm just gonna do a quick memory scan.
See what kind of goodies you brought back.
Here we go.
Alright.
There we go.
Hopefully you'll do better than the last jumper, who apparently had a thing for cat videos.
I'm more of a dog lover myself.
Right.
Alright now we're cooking with main power.
OK.
Ooh..
Hello, gorgeous.

-I really wish you could hear me!

I have a new broadcast for you.
-Right away, captain.
17.
54.
7.
95.
28.
43.
-I intercepted an incoming rebel transmission.
Sending it now.
-29.
35.
54.
7.

-Coordinates,American Southwest.
Early 21st century, right Before the last world war.
-What do we know about this timezone?"
-It matches the rebels' profile, alright.
Accidents, suicides, suspicious deaths.
-How did we miss this cluster?
-All the victims were low-level players, sir.
No one of any real significance.
-Damn it, we don't know that!
50 years ago, we were all young officers!
Hell I could be on their list!

And nobody around here would notice our absence.
Sir, do you know how difficult it is to monitor all of downtime?
The past is a big place.
And it's about to get a lot smaller.
Send in the hunter.
- Hunter Alpha Charlie 42, report to the stasis chambers immediately.
-Deputy Minister, I didn't expect to see you here.
Where is the usual jump technician?
-I gave him the day off.

There's something I wanted to show you personally.
-It doesn't look like much.

The design was kept intentionally simple to avoid suspicion from local authorities authorities.
Trust me.

-What is it?
-Something new.

All of this is top secret,of course.
-I can keep a secret.
-Good.
-I like it, the rebels will never know what hit them.
-That is the idea.

-Oh yeah.
-Are you ready?
-Let's go kill us some Skinners.
-Prize truth.
-Seek Harmony.
I guess this vessel will do.
-Hey Y'alls, Be right careful out there.

-How's your head?
-It feels like Paseo just split it open with a jackhammer.
and filled it back in with concrete.
-I don't remember the recruiter mentioning this part.
"Be a temporal agent,"He said, "change the world." He said.
-Maybe we were out sick that day.
We were out sick a lot.

-Mine too.
-Nice night for a walk.

It was better before the Skinners moved in.
-You are in violation of temporal ordnance 19.8-4, time-travel with the intent of changing the future.
How do you plead?
-We will destroy the Cabal before it even begins.
-Guilty it is.
-What are you going to do?

If you kill this vessel, I'll just come back in a new skin.
-That was the old way, it was kind of like playing "Whack-a mole" back then.
We do not play that game anymore.
See you Uptime.

Poor little Skinner has no skin.
How does she keep her insides in?
I'd like to report a vermin infestation.
Please send someone to this location at your earliest convenience.
-The fugitive is in custody, ready for interrogation.
-What is it, Brewer?

We have one of the rebels in custody.

-Yes, sir.

-I don't like you staying here.

-I'll be fine.
The mom's harmless and the boyfriend's just...
-Boyfriend?
Do I need to take care of it?

What?

-You can't fool me, no matter what skin you're in.
Something's bothering you.
-It's just...it's only been a day.
That new vessel can't come soon enough.
-We only have to wait a couple of weeks.
-I'll be by in the morning to pick you up, OK?
-Alright, it's a date.
-This sucks.
I can't...
It's working.
Is it you, Ava?
-You're still here, aren't you?
I do not know how much you can understand, but just know that this is a part of something big.
An I wouldn't be here if it wasn't really important.
I'm Sorry.

-I'm not dead!

-Hey,Ava!

-You literally just told me you love me and now you're blowing me off?
What's gong on with you?
Ever since that party you've been acting weird.
-Then move on, good talking to you.
-Is he bothering you?

-And who is this guy?

You should know when a lady's not interested, right?
Hit the bricks.

-Lancer?
OK.

It's either him or it's me.
-Don't ever give a girl an ultimatum.

Alright, what is it?
-I don't like that guy.
-He's a kid, he's harmless.

-You're jealous.

It's only temporary, okay?
Stay focused.

-Do either of you know what this is or what it's supposed to do?
No.

-The Cabal used a 256-bit key cipher.
So, whatever that thing does, they don't want it to become public knowledge.
-Well, it's clearly intended to be used downtime.
-How can you tell?
-The design is simple enough that a single hunter could memorize it.
And the components are all readily available in this timezone.
The only tricky part is this magnetron.
But those are available in any microwave oven.
-So you can actually build this?
-In for doodles.
-Does anyone doubt?

Whole shit in the woods?
If a tree falls in the woods, do leprechauns come out of my butt?
-Has anyone heard from agent Nightingale?
It's unusual for her to not check in.
-I love technology.
Do you remember how hard it was questioning rebels in the old days?
It took a long drawn out process.
Starvation, sleep deprivation, beatings, torture...
And even then, the Intel was usually used to be wrong.
This is so much more efficient.
- I do miss the screams, though.

-Aha!

You see how simple that was?
Well, it was nice working with you, my dear, but your services are no longer needed.
Well, let's go pay a visit to our rebel friends.
-Oh no!
-Suthers speaking.
Are you sure it's her?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you for letting me know.
Some time last night, Agent Nightingale was attacked.
Her empty vessel was found in an alley.
Here.

-Nothing was stolen and there is no sign of trauma.
We have reason to believe that cabal has anew hunter operating in this timezone.
As of right now, our number one priority is to find and eliminate this hunter.
We need to retrace Nightingale's final steps.
I want footage from every cameras in a two-block radius.
This hunter has a face,
By the end of today I want it plastered up on that wall for everyone to see.
And by tomorrow, I want it covered with a big red X.
Am I understood?
-Sir,yes, sir!
-We will send the Cabal a message:
"We are armed, we're trained and we are ready!"
Now let's go find this asshole and bring them down!
-Yeah!
-We might have one small problem.

-Cabal has a new toy, and it's nasty.
-This tech is so primitive.
How are we supposed to ID anybody with this?
What do you think happens to our vessels receptacles when they die?
To their spirit, I mean.
-I don't...

I mean, we are all made of energy.
When it gets released, it goes back into the cosmos, I suppose?
Or were you looking for a more heaven and hell,
"Is there life after death?

-I don't know, but...
You can't tell anyone, but I think my new skin is a remnant.
-What would make you say that?
-I've seen things, like messages on my computer screen, and...
-Do not let that kind of talk get out.
It's dangerous.
-Do you think I don't know that?
At first, I thought I was being paranoid or delusional you know, first jump stuff, but now I don't know.
I think it was a premature jump.
Shit!

-I don't know, maybe.

-You know that remnants can't officially exist. "
-Yeah, but if she wasn't dead yet..."
-So if the girl is a remnant, that means that somebody at headquarters messed up big time.
But they will never admit that.
They will pin it on you first.
-Do you think they'll ground me?

And then we will never see each other again.
Do you understand?
So, before you go telling anybody else just wait.
You know, maybe...maybe you'll feel different in a new skin.
-I hope so.
Captain!

-Zoom in.

Well, I'll be damned.
-Hello, Matthew.

-Actually, I'm here to see you.

-Yes, ma'am.
There's something about Ava that, as her mother,
I think you ought to know.
-So this thing is like a prison for souls?
-In a nutshell, yes.
How do we stop it?
Well, we don't.

There's a problem with the prototype, there's a flaw with the compact symmetries and compilers.
-Have you tried to reverse the polarity?
-I need to go back through the data dump and see if there's something that I'm missing.
-Um, so what are we gonna do about the hunter?
-My advice?

-Why are you doing this?
Come on,it's too dangerous.

-And risk you going to jail, for kidnapping or even worse?

-There's a hunter on the streets,

-I can't lose you.
-Don't worry.the second my new transfer comes in,
I'll be at your door, with my bags packed
Until then, this is our best option.
-Who was that?

-You know it's not health for a grown man to be hanging around with a 15 year old.
-OK, mother.
-Are you dealing drugs?

Did you have sex with him?
I'm not having this conversation right now.
-Was that Lancer?
-How did you know his name?

-You were in my room?

-I don't want you seeing him anymore.
-I told you.

-This isn't a game, Ava!
You think that he loves you, and that he's gonna take care of you and you're gonna live happily ever after?
Wake up!

You're gonna wake up one day my age, and have a teenager that hates you because you are never there for her.
Then, to punish you, you'll keep making the same mistakes.
The same mistakes that I did.
It's like watching your own failures over and over again and there isn't a damn thing you can do about it.
-I am not a failure.

-So, it looks like someone is scheduled for a replacement.
Oh, shit!
-Move, move!

-Hey!
-I've located the rebel sleepers.
Notify the Chief Minister.
The vermin has been exterminated.
What's the matter?

Baby?

-It hurts.
-Hold on.

-No!

-You need help, you're sick.
-No!

I'm OK, see?

-I didn't mean what I said earlier.
-You're not a failure.
You're my daughter and I love you very much.
-I love you, too.
-I love you.
"Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as the night.
And when you move, fall like a thunderbolt."
Did you ever read Sun Tzu, The Art of War?
written in the 5th century BC?
The greatest military treatise ever written.
-I can't say That I have.

We've finally reached the brink of peace.
-What is going on there?

- Say something!

Just calm down.

The details are sketchy but there was an attack on base uptime/
-What about the stasis chamber?
-Destroyed.

-You already know that answer.
-So you are saying we are trapped in this timezone?
-For the foreseeable future.
I don't expect reinforcements to arrive any time soon, or exchange them.
Yes, this is a setback, I'm not gonna lie.
But it doesn't change our mission.
This latest act of aggression is proof we're a threat.
The Cabal know we have the power to change the future, to rewrite them out of history.
And that's exactly what we're going to do.
Tomorrow we will mourn, but today we are going to go back to our work stations and find a way to take these bastards out.
Now let's go do it!

-Hey, where are you going?

-Get that prototype working ASAP.

-Seattle!
-Everything alright?

-We can leave, right now, just you and me.
-And go where?

-We will start a new life, away from the Cabal and away from the Huntress.
-And abandon the mission?

-If the mission was actually successful, if the Cabal never existed,
There would have no reason to send us back to this timezone in the first place.
-What are you saying?

It always fails,it has to, or else we wouldn't be here.
-No,no,no...

Otherwise it's pointless.
-If we leave right now, we might have a chance.
-A chance to do what?

You and I both know how this story goes and it doesn't have a good ending.
And I'm gonna give it one.
-Seattle.

Shit.
-Troubles with your lady friend?

-Ain't nothing complicated about love.

It don't get much simpler than that.
But life, on the other hand, now that will trip you up every time.
-Yeah?

-Sometimes life makes our choices- for us.
-Hey, it's OK.
-I just don't get it.
I thought things were going so good between us, you know?
-Matt?

-I know, she blew us both off.
-Something changed.
I can't help but think about the last time I saw her and
She just wasn't herself.
I know how to get you to stop thinking about her.
-What?
-You bitch!
Do not stand at my grave and weep.
I am not there, I do not sleep,
I am the thousand winds that blow.
I am the diamond that glints in the snow.
I am the sunlight of ripened grain, I am the gentle autumn rain.
When you awaken with morning's hush,
I am the swift uplifting rush of quiet birds and circled fire.
I am the soft stars that shine at night.
Do not stand at my grave and cry.
I am not there, I did not die.
-We can't compete with the Cabal Uptime.
They are bigger than us and have unlimited resources.
If you're not gonna help me, I'll find someone who will.
You.
Hunter.
-I found you.
-You're not a Skinner.
What are you?
This?
Do you know where they are?
Can you take me to them?
-Are you lost?

-Paseo, how are we coming on that prototype?
Hide!
-Captain, are you OK?
Hunter!
-Hey, who turned out the lights?
-Sir!
-Shit!
Oh, double shit!
-It's clean.

-That's our lucky day.
-We're gonna need to apply pressure to keep it from bleeding.
-Paseo, what is that?
-A polymorphic virus.
If the Cabal tries to access our data, it will wipe the servers and take us out with it.
-How long does that take?
-Longer than we probably have.
OK, OK.
You'll keep this safe, won't you?

-Go.

-Sad little Skinner, all alone.
Time to fly away.
Fly away.
Fly away home.
- Maybe he got her?

-There is a whole nest of vermin at this location.
Please send someone to clean them up.
-Oh my God.
-How does it look?
-You'll live.
-What is he doing in here?

If you would just let me explain...
-Whose blood is this?

-Uh-uh, I'm calling the cops on this one.
-No cops.
On your knees.
-Ava, I don't even know who you are anymore.
Keep an eye on her, I'm gonna go find some rope.
-You destroyed her life!
-it's not as simple as all that.
If you are looking for your skin,remnant, it's not here.
Unless you know where the skinner is who took it,
I'm afraid there's not much I can do to help.
-Home.
-Sorry about this, it would take me too long to explain.
And you would not believe me anyway.
-Jesus, mom!
What did you do?
You're gonna regret this, Hunter.
-Look who's back.

Are you sure that's where they are?
Good job, kiddo.
-There has to be other operatives in other time zones.
-Didn't Derby say something about a Pacific unit?
-Right, in Bel Air.

-But how?

What's going on?
-It's Ava.

-No, no, no.

-No, you can't go.

-Showtime.
-What are you doing?

-We're not supposed to share knowledge of future events.
-Or what?

-This is a really bad idea.

-Ava, I hope you're watching this.
Take a good look because I want you to remember all of it.
This is the future that you created.

By helping the Cabal, you've just signed a death sentence for the whole world.
-I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
-Oh Shit.

-Oh, damn!
-Hey!
-Stop, it's no good.

-Come here.
-One of us has to make it to California.
-I'm not going.
I'm not leaving you.
-Sometimes life makes our choices for us, huh?
Take this.
Go, go.
-I'm not afraid of you.

-Theses last efforts at heroics are pathetic.
-Mom!
-Now's not a good time.
- You hurt my Mom.

-I thought you were trying to help.
-Move, or you'll never get your body back.
Isn't this what you want?

-She didn't steal it.

-Do you know what this is?

-You're a Skinner, too.
-No!
Seattle...
Seattle?

-Seattle.

-What?
What?

-Seattle?
Oh fuck.

No.

Seattle, I'm gonna get you out of there, I promise.
-I'm sorry.

-She was.
Tell me you know how to save her.

Say it!
Say it, or I'll slit your throat right here and now.
-Do you know the way to Piccadilly Circus?
-What?
What?
-You're supposed to say 'We've run out of blackbird pie.'
Seattle?
Seattle...
-Com on, lets patch you up.
-I know this is not gonna really make up for anything, but just trust me when I say things will be better now.
And I'm sorry.
-Come here, honey, give me a hug.
-Why are you keeping that?
-"Keep your friends close but your enemies closer".
What?
-Nothing.
It's just...
It's a little weird.

That's all.

-I'm sorry, is this Skin not good enough for you?
Should I try to find another one?

I approve.I approve of it very much.
-Hi, um, look, everything has been really crazy lately.
And I just want to say thank you for helping us.
So, what are we gonna do now?
-You?

Be yourself again.

Don't let it slip away.
-I don't think I can if I tried.
So what are you guys gonna do?
-We've got a lot of ground to cover before we reach California,
Ready?

-Do you guys have to leave?
Eventually, the Cabal will realize their Hunter is out of commission.
-Yeah, they will send others.
So it will be safer for you and your mom is we are far away when this happens.
-Be careful out there.

-You, too, Seattle.
Mom, what's for breakfast?
