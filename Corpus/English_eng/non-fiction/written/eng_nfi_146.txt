Previously on Sleepy Hollow...
I'm infected.
I'm not your responsibility, okay?
You're my friend, Alex.
Two Witnesses, we look out for one another.
Anything we face, we face as one.
Turns out our agency has a pedigree.
We are the occupational descendants of real heroes.
From here on out, I'm just gonna be honest, promise.
Something's coming.
Not something, Miss Jenny.
I'm destined to become the best thing that has ever happened to America.
Is this really what you wanted, Dreyfuss?
The death of democracy?
Move it, you're holding everyone up.
And posted.
I don't even know what we're doing here on this kid's obstacle course.
Oh.
Is there a competition for getting humiliated by 12-year-old girls?
'Cause if so, you're kicking butt.
You can make fun all you want.
But I'm gonna make sure that I'm in primo shape so whenever I'm needed, I'll be ready.
Ow, ow, ow.
This is about the Vault, isn't it?
You find out that we work for the same agency, as Davy Crockett and Sacagawea once did, and now you're convinced you need to be James Bond.
We are not worthy.
Dude, get a grip.
What are you trying to prove?
You just took down a demonic djinn, and saved a bunch of lives in the process.
Including mine.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you saying I'm your hero?
Next time just let me get absorbed by the djinn, okay?
I'm a mess.
All right, now.
Will you time me, please?
Okay?
Okay.
I'm good, I'm good.
Don't forget, your interpretations of Munch's The Scream are due tomorrow.
Or else you might see me screaming.
Hey, Molly.
I noticed your past couple of assignments seemed incomplete.
Do you need an extension on them?
I guess.
Our next unit's gonna be a lot of fun.
I know how you like mixed-media projects.
Molly, Mr. David is speaking to you.
That's okay.
I am so sorry about that.
Yeah.
But if you don't mind me asking, is everything okay with Molly at home?
I might be flattering myself but I thought
That's why I couldn't help but notice that she just hasn't been herself lately.
I'd love to discuss this further, but I've got a faculty meeting.
Can you come by later?
Sure.
Great.
Kind of rough back there with Mr. David.
Guess you're right.
School's overrated.
There are a lot of career options that don't require an education.
I'm thinking pirates.
Look, I know with everything going on it seems like school isn't important, but it is.
It's... really good for us to keep some normal in our lives.
It's always gonna be like this from now on, isn't it?
Monsters disguised as Dad.
Logan MacDonald getting sick from a curse.
Visions of Mr. Crane, except he's not Mr. Crane.
Molly!
Hello?
He was so scared, Mom, so alone.
We still don't know exactly what it is that you saw.
It could have been a-a bad dream.
Got an idea.
I've been talking to the others about showing you something, but... maybe now's the time.
Showing me something?
What?
Welcome to the Vault.
What is this place?
Uh, the most amazing library ever.
An archive of the incredible.
A repository of the impossible.
A storehouse of secrets great and small.
Whoa.
This... is the untold history of America, huh?
This is a collection of weapons from myth and lore.
Huh?
And this... is classified supernatural information that's only revealed to sitting U.S. presidents.
And now... you.
What is this?
That is a Native American Thunderstone, created by the Pawnee Morning Star god.
It's supposed to protect you from lightning.
I haven't tested it out yet, if you want to help.
I know you've been through some dark and scary stuff.
But you also get to be a part of something that only a few people in the whole world know about.
You get to be a part of a secret club.
What do you think?
I think this is really cool.
Good.
Mr. Crane's gonna be here in a few minutes.
You're not staying?
I have to do some stuff for work, but...
Jake and Alex will show you anything you want.
Anything that's... not too dangerous, right?
Now... where should we start?
Are you sure about this?
Indian ascetics have used this method for centuries in pursuit of their visions.
But you seem to have no trouble accessing your visions.
To a point, Jobe.
I've seen the future to a point.
Now I need to push past what I've glimpsed.
I need to extend the limits.
I hope you find what you seek, Malcolm.
I always have so much trouble with your eyes.
Really?
Would that be because they're so fantastically full of wisdom?
Well, if I mess this up, then you'll only have yourself to blame when your present isn't perfect.
My present?
Of course.
It's a little thank you gift for everything.
Can we fly the glider tomorrow?
A girl after my own heart.
I can't deny you anything, now, can I?
So... was the future different this time?
It's still the future I'm destined to bring about.
But it's far superior this time.
How so?
I'm not alone.
Master Wells and Miss Alex will return shortly with our repast.
Something a little more delectable than Neapolitan flatbread.
Well, look at that.
You know this was actually worn by Davy Crockett.
True.
Now, legend would have you believe that this was fashioned from common raccoon.
But between you and me, this is actually Wendigo pelt.
Wendi what?
Wendigo.
It's a shape-shifting beast of Shawnee and Algonquian legend.
Monsters.
Monsters.
Where do they come from?
Purgatory.
Hell dimensions.
Hidden pockets of existence of which we are only dimly aware.
And they just roam around like wild animals?
Some do.
Mostly they appear when summoned.
When a person wishes to perpetrate evil.
So bad people means bad monsters.
Now that is very aptly put.
I know a good monster.
A good monster?
Finally.
Yeah.
I made him up when I was little.
He's one of the first things I remember drawing.
His body was my favorite blanket.
Whenever I was scared or lonely, he'd be there for me.
I call him Mr. Stitch.
Oh.
It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mr. Stitch.
He used to sing me this song.
Even as a born and bred Washingtonian
I suspect you are unaware of the secret passageways beneath the city.
Whoa.
Whoa, indeed.
During the War of 1812, these were used to transport munitions, and spies traversed them to vital points around the city.
Nowadays, Master Wells stores bottles of his fuller-bodied syrah down here.
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Um, what's going on?
I'm not certain.
A switch... of some... kind.
Nope.
Well, no, no, no, it's all right, trust me.
There's, um...
We'll sort this.
This is sort of like the lockdown drills we have at school.
Not locked in.
Right.
We shall get our sharpest minds on the case.
What are you doing?
Uh, I believe we have stumbled upon a more effective form of communication,
Master Wells.
Uh, right.
You guys okay in there?
All right, hang tight, we're gonna check on things, and we'll get back to you.
Well, he's right.
They are in the safest place in the building.
Which is what makes me think that this is a security system of some kind.
I'm learning there's a lot about the Vault we never knew.
That's the mark of Benjamin Banneker.
Right, and we know that he specialized in guards and traps, which makes me think that he's the one that designed
Jenny's scouting the exterior and the tunnels.
A technical malfunction?
On the one day I wanted Molly to see this world isn't completely dangerous and unpredictable.
Okay, guys, check this out.
It looks like someone decided to beef up the security with their own mystical reinforcements.
These were carved at a later time.
I don't recognize these symbols.
Wait, wait, wait, this number.
It's a federal I.D.
Federal I.D.?
Okay.
This I.D. belonged to...
She worked in the Office of Intelligence and Analysis from 2001 to 2003.
She transferred and spent the next seven years... in Agency 355.
Last record of her dates back to 2011.
Last known address is...
I'm supposed to be meeting with Molly's teacher.
He thinks she's having some trouble at home.
I'm not leaving, not with her stuck in here.
I had a teacher that sounded the alarm on me a little bit too early, and I had to spend the next year reporting to a social worker.
I'll be a half hour, tops.
We'll get to the bottom of these runes.
We'll be back soon!
We are on... the... case!
Do you want me to go talk to Molly's teacher, and you can go with him?
Ms. Thomas, thanks for coming.
If you're looking for the administrative office...
Mr. David?
Yes, I need an ambulance at Liberty Elementary School.
Thank you.
Okay, okay, just relax.
Help's on the way.
He's gonna be fine.
The police are working under the theory that it was a robbery gone awry.
But that's not what you believe.
No.
Agent Thomas?
When Molly was younger, she had an imaginary friend... it had green hair and his body was made out of her baby blanket.
She used to draw it all the time.
How do you know that?
Molly drew a picture of the creature in her notebook earlier.
So Molly's imaginary friend came to life?
It is not unheard of.
When my son was but a boy, he found solace in a treasured doll, and at a certain point, the doll came to life.
It became a champion for him.
A golem.
What does this thing want?
Did she send it to attack her teacher?
It is my understanding that these beings have a mind of their own.
In the meantime, what would be helpful is if you could uncover any information about
Clues to its characteristics.
I'll look into them.
Not exactly a luxurious retirement.
When I transferred to the Vault from DHS Office Archives, that place had been abandoned for years.
Claudia Russell could fill in the gaps for us.
Ms. Russell?
Ms. Russell?
We're here from the Vault.
We, uh, just had a few questions.
We're unarmed!
Alex.
It's boobytrapped.
Oh, God.
Claudia Russell, I presume.
Hey, easy.
Hasn't anyone ever told you not to sneak up on people, especially armed people?
It's force of habit.
Sneaky's kind of my default mode.
Crane filled me in.
Said you needed some help.
I checked out all of the protective wards
I put around the entrances.
Nothing's been tripped.
This is the original blanket.
It's completely intact.
I still don't get it.
How does this thing just pop out of Molly's head?
Somehow, some kind of spell was activated.
Maybe we can figure out why it went to Molly's school.
Molly must have been five, maybe six.
Told her to draw what made her happy.
At the time, I was pretty focused on my job, so...
I was away a lot.
Part of me thinks that she just... dreamt up Mr. Stitch as a person who could be around when I couldn't.
You know, it's funny... as tough as this whole...
Witness business has been, it's brought us closer together.
It was the same for Abby and me.
Battling the supernatural made us sisters again.
And it helped me get over some serious resentment I had towards her.
Hey, check this out.
If you're watching this, it means they got me.
Don't know what it was.
A monster.
Demon.
Doesn't matter how many hexes or wards you put up, evil always finds a way.
Funny... we thought we had all the advantages.
We had the Vault, right?
"The last line of defense against all threats deemed otherworldly."
But the downside of being a secret organization is that people forget about you.
Maybe we did our job too well.
Kept the monsters at bay, which meant people forgot to be afraid.
They forgot.
But I'll never forget... about the sacrifices we made, the blood spilled, about Michael my friend.
That's why I had to leave the Vault.
To get away from the demons.
And the memories.
Everywhere I turned,
I saw Michael.
But not here.
I know they'll find me.
They always will, because evil never forgets.
But I'll be ready for them.
I'll be ready.
What you doin'?
Trying to find an escape route.
One must never sit around and wait for help.
Rescue yourself.
If there's one lesson from today, let it be that one.
And another lesson is book cabinets are lighter without books.
Molly...
Uh, yeah, wasn't that an animated movie
Animated...
Pygmalion was a sculptor, and he created a statue of a woman, who he called Galatea.
Now, Galatea was so beautiful, exquisite, and Pygmalion fell desperately, helplessly in love with her.
So he entreated the gods with all his passion to bring her to life. "Please."
And they did.
That really happened?
Well, one thing you learn from the Vault is that all stories have a hint of truth to them.
Pygmalion is a story of creation, about how artistic talent and intense emotion can bring beings to life.
Molly, a short while ago, your teacher,
Mr. David, was attacked.
But we believe he was attacked by a monster.
More precisely, we believe he was attacked by Mr. Stitch.
What?
I know, I know.
Have you dabbled with anything involving magic lately?
No, I've been really careful.
It's all right, it's all right.
I believe you.
Here, let's set aside how Mr. Stitch came into being, and together we will focus on where he's going next, yes?
Why do you think Mr. Stitch went after Mr. David?
Well, Mr. Stitch is not evil.
He wouldn't hurt someone for no reason.
I-I mean, I really like him.
I'm not mad at Mr. David!
No.
Molly, Mr. David is speaking to you.
She thinks she's helping me, but she's not.
"She"?
She thinks she knows what I'm feeling, but she doesn't.
She says we should be honest with each other, but she's the one who was lying.
Where'd it go?
In Molly's stories, Mr. Stitch had to go to bed at night, to hibernate at sundown.
So, Crane has some theories on this thing's behavioral patterns.
He thinks a basic summoning ritual will draw it out of hiding.
This image comes up a lot.
That looks like Shenandoah Amusement Park.
Okay, well, Mr. Stitch could still be drawn to the site.
Well, it's just west of here.
But it's acting off of thoughts in her brain, so why did it come to our house?
Well, it's trying to protect her.
It's going after those for whom she has... negative emotions.
But, look, we're talking about the id here.
This is a deep, dark stew of impulses and instincts and crazy thoughts.
And somewhere in there, my daughter is thinking
She doesn't hate you.
She loves you.
She loves you so much that she can't tell you about all this that's bothering her, because she knows it would hurt you.
So instead a monster from her imagination's gonna hurt me.
Actually, if you think about it,
Well, here's something bigger than life sending you a message.
You sure this is everything Claudia had on the Vault's infrastructure?
I think I found something.
Wait, these are the glyphs she added.
They're Norse-based!
According to these plans, the actuators are both magical and physical.
Meaning?
That reading the symbols isn't gonna open the doors.
It'll just allow you to access a servo that controls these barriers.
Where's the servo located?
In a utility duct, behind the west wall.
There's an entry point from inside the Vault.
And there's one other problem...
Is there any way to widen the opening?
Not without heavier tools.
Miss Alex, do you have anything that might assist
I wouldn't mess with that in an enclosed space.
I mean, the concussive blast could make your heads implode.
I can go.
Uh, I want to do this.
This whole thing is sort of my fault.
Well, didn't you say that we should rescue ourselves?
That's what we must always do?
Your mother is going to have my guts for garters.
I'm going down!
Go ahead, Master Jake!
Ur.
Permanence.
Hagal.
Protection.
Sig.
Victory.
Fa.
Spirit.
I see it!
Last one's stuck!
The last one is stuck!
Hang on!
I think there might be another way out!
Molly!
Molly!
Master Jake,
I believe Molly is making her way outside on her own.
That could only lead to the alley that's on the west side.
Crane, we're on our way.
Hello, Molly.
Crane says that a simple decomposition spell conducted within a ten-meter radius of the creature should do the trick.
I will never get used to what you guys think is simple.
There.
We do have a number of mutual friends.
My name is Malcolm.
I have heard so much about you.
You are very special, my friend.
I am?
Oh, yes.
If I have any gifts at all, I would have to say my greatest gift is my affinity for recognizing talent.
And it couldn't be any more evident to me that you are blessed with an extraordinary capacity for creativity and vision.
Um, how did you say you knew me?
But let me ask you something, my friend.
Would you say you're happy?
See, I ask because
I don't think you are.
I think you know, deep down... something's not right.
Something with you, something with your family, something with the world.
And that's why
I felt such a great urgency to finally come and meet you, because I just wanted to let you know this.
It's gonna get better, Molly.
I think I need to find my friends.
Yes, yes.
I'll see you soon.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Your mom... she's gonna want to see you.
She'll be wrapping stuff up shortly, all right?
Sad to see this thing go.
It's either that, or Mr. Stitch lives to see another day.
Once the ritual's finished, we should be rid of this thing.
Thalia.
Clio...
No!
Stop!
I'm sorry I brought you here.
I didn't mean to.
I guess I just needed someone to talk to.
You were always the one who listened.
I guess I should have been talking to you, Mom.
Oh, my God.
I still need to finish the ritual.
Blanket.
Honey, you can talk to me whenever you want, I promise.
I want to tell you that...
I don't like it when you say that everything's going to be okay, even though I know that it's not.
I don't like it when you keep things from me.
You're angry with me.
Yes, but I don't want to be.
Then you can let it all out.
Come here.
Clio...
Good-bye.
It shouldn't be long now, Mr. Crane!
Jenny's in the duct as we speak!
You are still not getting the hang of this, are you?
I await with alacrity.
What do you want to do with these?
Those are valuable documents regarding the history of the Vault.
And a tale of sadness and woe.
Soon to be our tale.
Whoa.
Oh, that is dark, even for you.
I mean, you can train to be a super Vault agent all you want, but that is what is in store for us... holed up in a shack eating canned beans, waiting for the boogeyman to come.
We got Crane, Diana, Jenny.
Look, you and me... we started this together, and we'll end it together.
Right.
Thank you.
Quiet contemplation had grown quite contemptuous.
Do you have the items I require?
Wonton soup, mushu pork, sesame noodles.
The delights of the Far East.
Capital work, Master Wells.
Man, Crane can really pack that Szechuan chicken away.
Guess Chinese takeout was far and few between in the 18th century.
What are you doing?
Molly left her backpack here.
I moved it, and this fell out.
Does that mean anything to you?
It's a Wiccan hex.
Do you know what it does?
"Courtesy of Little Readers of D.C."?
Yeah, I looked it up.
Little Readers donated these devices to public schools.
And guess who's head of the charity.
Who?
Malcolm Dreyfuss.
I think Molly was targeted specifically.
Dreyfuss planted a magically charged device on her.
That's what conjured the monster.
Dreyfuss has totally gone off the deep end this time.
I mean, he's always been crazy, but shutting down the company?
The stock is gonna drop like a rock.
I don't know if he cares about that kind of stuff anymore.
Why not?
I get the feeling he's got his eyes on a different prize.
You've caused quite a stir.
I've been reading about the philosophy of decluttering.
The idea is to evaluate every possession in your life and ask yourself, "Does this still bring me joy?"
And if not, you got to let it go.
I've seen my future, Jobe.
It's time to make it a reality.
No more distractions.
I need every resource I've got to move on to the next phase.
Speaking of which, how is the rest of my team coming along?
And the girl?
Now that you've met, do you have a better idea of what to do with her?
I didn't realize how important she would be until I actually saw her.
I knew she would mean a lot to me, but... what I didn't... couldn't know was was how much I could mean to her.
After all, what little girl doesn't need a real... father... in her life?
