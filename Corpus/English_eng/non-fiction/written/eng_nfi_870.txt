This changes everything.
[squawks] [explosion]
Sorry about that, little guy.
Toothless, faster!
Dive!
[splashes] [water bubbling]
[explosion]
Whoo!
Nice one, bud.
This'll definitely give us an added element of surprise.
[growls in approval]
[Heather] Hmm.
Hmm!
Mm-hmm.
[chuckles]
Yes!
This is totally unfair.
You manipulated my partner with your big brown eyes.
They're green.
[Snotlout] Shut up.
Well, well, well, look what the Night Fury dragged in.
-[growls wearily] -[laughs sarcastically] Very funny.
Seriously, Hiccup, you've been pushing it pretty hard lately.
Everyone needs a rest.
[gasps] Dagur!
I told you I'd be back.
Thanks.
So, how are we gonna hurt Viggo?
Cooking is in our family's blood.
[Chicken clucking in panic]
Everyone knows that Chicken suffers from rotisserie-phobia.
He's afraid of the ole' turn and burn.
Sorry, Boy-nutt and Chicken-nutt.
It's just, we've been out there all alone for so long.
-[grunts] -[growls in excitement] [chomping]
[gulps, tummy growling] [chomping]
Dagur, what about Viggo?
Yes, of course.
The strangest thing happened while I was out traveling the world in search of Oswald the Agreeable.
Wait a minute, you're searching for our father?
You see, since I didn't kill him, and you didn't kill him,
I figure he must be out there, somewhere.
So, there I was, searching for dear old dad, when I captured the wimpiest Dragon Hunter. [chuckling]
I mean, I actually had to give him the Berserker chokehold just to shut him up.
Not that one.
-[grunts] -[gasps]
Oh, that's the one.
So, what did the Hunter say about Viggo?
I'll tell you if you call me brother.
He told me where Viggo hides his gold.
What?
Whoa.
And if I remember correctly, some of that gold...
Is Berk's gold.
Bingo.
And we could get it back and cripple Viggo in one blow.
Let's ride.
Heather and I will need it as we embark on an epic journey to reunite with our father and rebuild the Berserker tribe as a family.
[chuckles] Yeah, right, Dagur.
Man, if Heather leaves, she'll take all her great cooking with her.
I don't know how I'm gonna survive.
I don't know if I can survive.
I'm sure she's not gonna leave.
She's one of us, right?
[sighs] Dagur just assumes I'm gonna drop everything and follow him on some crazy adventure to find our dad.
Uh, did he even think to ask me first?
He's Dagur.
[Shattermaster growling]
Berserkers and Dragon Riders!
May our first mission be successful!
[laughs] Yeah!
Uh, hello?
You mean, Dragon Riders and one Berserker.
[Hiccup] All right, gang, diamond formation.
Remember, we're heading into Viggo's domain.
Expect the unexpected.
[whizzing]
What the...
Are you absolutely sure this is the right island?
Yes, I'm sure.
But Viggo might have moved the gold.
He can be slippery.
Hmm.
Something doesn't feel right.
This is an amazing find, Hiccup.
Ancient Vikings must have lived here.
We're not here to destroy history, we're here to find the gold.
Hmm.
Is anyone seeing any gold?
Snotlout, expect the unexpected.
You want to do the honors or shall I?
[grunts]
Once we get the gold, our real journey begins.
Hey, don't get too close, guys.
I'm sure Viggo booby-trapped this thing.
Fear not, my fearless leader,
Ruff and I are the best booby-trap sniffers that have ever sniffed out a booby... trap.
Okay, it's time to out-think the thinker.
Watch for the trip lines!
Falling axes!
Look around, make sure there's none.
That's because he's gonna kill us with crossbow arrows!
Hmm. [sniffs]
Wait a second. [sniffs]
[chokes, gasps] [screaming, coughing]
[groans]
[Tuffnut groaning]
Give it a good one, Bud.
[roars] [clangs, explosion]
Oh, what the...
[Hiccup sighs] It must be reinforced.
You tried your way, Hiccup.
Right, Heather?
But what it really means is going full speed.
All out, all the time.
Total commitment to your Berserker brothers and sisters.
So, if you wanna know what Berserker style really is.
Show 'em our new move, Shattermaster.
[growls]
Shatter scatter.
[Berserker battle cry] [clangs] [all grunt]
-[rumbling] -[Snotlout screams, groans] [growls]
[Dagur] Not so dragon-proof anymore.
Bravo, Shattermaster.
That's what you call a Berserker Battle Cry.
You'll get it.
[sighs]
Well, I guess we're too late.
Viggo moved the gold.
Well, it looks like the cart tracks
Fishlegs, look at the depth of the tracks.
Yeah, no, they're deeper coming in, and more shallow going out.
Someone rolled the gold in here, then off loaded it and carried it away by hand.
So this storehouse is just a decoy.
The gold is somewhere else on the island.
Viggo and his men could come at any time.
Stay on the ground, send up a signal if you find anything.
We will.
Once we get our share of Viggo's gold, we'll head straight toward the sunrise.
I know a shifty little guy in the Eastern Markets who might have some info on Dad.
You know, you barge into my life like a Cavern Crasher ramped up on dragon nip and just unload all these grand ideas.
[sighs] I've been out there, Heather, living and surviving on my own.
It's a lonely, desolate existence.
You don't have to tell me.
[Meatlug groans woefully]
I know I don't.
When I realized how hard it must have been for you, all those years, alone,
I knew I had to make it right.
I mean, sure, I have Shattermaster, you have Windshear, but it's not the same thing as having your family, your fellow Berserkers.
Maybe you should have thought about that before you set me adrift.
I don't know how you'll ever forgive me, Heather, but not a day goes by that I don't wish I could take that back.
I was young and foolish--
And twisted and evil.
Okay, I deserve that.
But I wanna make it right, once and for all.
Don't you see, Heather?
This is my chance, our chance, to rebuild the Berserker's tribe.
But we'll only succeed if we do it together, as a family.
[sniffs]
Well, at least we know everywhere it's not.
We have to find that gold, Astrid.
It will cripple Viggo and get Berk back on its feet.
Yeah, I want all those things too, but if the gold isn't here--
You know Viggo, everything with him is a trick.
[Dragon Hunters chattering indistinctly]
[Fishlegs whimpers]
Sometimes I miss the pleasant zen of a deep, dark cave.
Here, goldie, goldie, goldie, goldie, goldie.
[dragons snarling distantly]
So.
So?
-[chuckles] -[chuckles, sighs]
I mean, you're a Dragon Rider.
But more than that,
Mmm.
[Terrible Terrors snarling]
And Terrible Terrors make terrible meditation partners?
What'd I miss?
[chuckles nervously]
[Dragon Hunter 1] Grab the shovel.
[Dragon Hunter 2] Let me move it in.
-[grunts] -[clanging]
[sniffling, snorts] [sniffling, grunts]
[all sneeze] [both gasp, scream]
Let's go, bud.
[both panting, grunting] [growls, screeches]
-[both panting] -[Hiccup] We got 'em.
-[gasping] -[laughing]
-[dragons screeching] -[screaming, groaning] [groaning]
[Snotlout] No!
[grunting with effort]
[Ryker] Look what we have here.
The catch of the day.
[laughs]
[screaming] [groans] [snarling]
[Dragon Hunters chattering]
Viggo.
And no sign of the other Dragon Riders.
We can't just sit here.
We need to rescue them now, before Viggo disappears.
I have known Hiccup for my whole life and he is my best friend, Dagur.
Whenever I have needed him, he has been there for me, and now, he needs me.
We are doing this my way.
[sniffles] Just beautiful.
I'll stand. [grunts]
[Ryker grunts]
[Viggo] Forgive my brother.
He doesn't understand the concept of savoring victory.
[snarls]
You and your Dragon Riders could have spent months searching that island and you'd never find my gold.
Well, you never know.
We might surprise you when you least expect it.
Ah, you're referring to your impending rescue?
Don't count on it. [chuckles sinisterly] [dragons snarling]
[Dragon Hunter groaning in annoyance] [growls] [roars] [sighs] There's gotta be a way out of here.
Cells are built to keep people in, not let them out, okay?
I'm starting to think you're not as-- [gags]
[Fishlegs] There they are.
You two attack the flanking ships.
[chants] Om.
[Dragon Hunter 1] Dragon Riders!
-[growls] -[both gasp] [growling]
Dragon Riders!
[Heather grunting with effort]
[Berserker battle cry] [all screaming]
[Berserker battle cry]
-[rumbling] -[Dragon Hunters screaming] [groaning]
Mm-hmm.
[Berserker battle cry] [thuds]
Look, there are your friends now, coming to save you.
Such loyalty.
I can hardly keep my own brother focused and on task.
What are you getting at, Viggo?
Do you really think, after all we've been through,
I'd expose myself without some added protection?
You're about to have a front row seat for the deaths of your Riders and their dragons.
[both exclaim]
[Shattermaster growling] [both gasping]
[ship creaking]
[Fishlegs] What?
Dragon-proof ships?
[Dragon Hunters screaming] [all grunting]
Anyone have any other thoughts that, you know, I might have mentioned earlier.
Fishlegs, I think maybe, we should try it my brother's way.
Your brother?
I mean, what do we have to lose?
[growling]
You sure this is gonna work?
We're doing it together, as brother and sister!
How can it fail?
Flying Shatter Scatter.
[whizzes]
-[crashes] -[Dragon Hunters screaming] [both gasping] [water bubbling]
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Coming around for another pass.
-[thuds] -[screams] Whoa.
-[clangs] -[grunts]
Oops.
-[growls] -[grunts]
[Berserker battle cry]
Music to my ears, sister!
Now, Windshear!
[clanging]
-[Dragon Hunters screaming] -[water bubbling]
That one's for Oswald!
[laughs]
-[thuds] -[all gasp] [both groan]
[both grunting]
Now, that is Berserker style.
[growling]
-[Toothless growling] -[Dragon Hunters grunting]
Toothless.
-[growls in anger] -[Dragon Hunters grunt]
[Dragon Hunter 1 screaming]
-[grunts] -[clangs] [chuckles] Hey, thanks!
-[Dragon Hunter 2 grunts] -[Toothless growls] [growls]
[screams] Toothless!
[exclaims]
-[groans] -[growls] [grunts]
[splashes]
-[water bubbling] -[Dragon Hunter 3 whimpering]
-[explosion] -[all screaming]
-[Astrid] Yes. [laughs] -[Hiccup] Whoo-hoo!
[Dragon Hunters clamoring]
How did you figure out where the gold is?
A few things tipped me off.
First, the tracks leading to the storehouse didn't make sense.
Then, the Hunters had shovels and pick axes, like they were building something.
But ultimately, Viggo gave it away himself, when he pointed to the map of the island over his desk.
There weren't any Viking ruins on Viggo's map.
Hit it, Bud.
[growls]
Genius.
It was hiding in plain sight all along.
[both grunting]
I have to go.
I know.
He can't do it without me.
And you need to find out about your family.
Your heritage.
You've been looking for a home since the first day I met you, Heather.
And maybe this is, finally, your chance to find it.
Just know that we will always...
I will always be here for you.
Mm. [kisses]
Thank you.
[growls adoringly]
She'll be safe with me.
She better be.
Be safe out there.
Let us know if you find Oswald.
For everything.
Until we meet again, Dragon Riders.
[Berserker battle cry]
Hey, she'll be back.
