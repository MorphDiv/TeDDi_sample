So, why don't you... tell me about yourself?
I don't...

I'm 43.

I have a son.
You don't wanna hear about any of that.
No, I do.

I'm sorry, it's just... it's my... first time doing this sort of thing.
That's okay.

You know, you got a...

It's... it's... it's sexy.
Oh, you think so, huh?
Yeah, yeah.
You're easy to talk to.
So...
It's probably why you're so good at your job.
Probably doesn't hurt.
Now you tell me something.
What do you want to know?
I don't know, like, um, what are you wearing?
- Kevlar.

Yeah.
Shooter's in position, keep him on the line.
Haas, this guy wants to be talked down.
Give me five more minutes.
Negative, soon as I got a shot, we're taking it.
Are you fucking crazy?

Five minutes.
Team one, what's your status?
Are you... are you there?

Yeah, Dan, I'm...

Hey, listen, I was thinking that, maybe we could meet in person.
You mean, like a date?
Yeah, sure.
Who am I kidding?
I didn't...

I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
All I wanted... all I wanted was my goddamn tax refund!
Dan, please.

Please.
I don't...

My little boy...

Team one, fire when ready.

Agent Blair!

Go.
Hey, Dan.
Why don't you tell me where we're gonna go on that date.
Wait, what?
Oh, yeah.

Yeah, this little place called Fa...

Falimese's, Faliense's?
Yeah?

Oh, yeah!

It's where I proposed to my bitch ex-wife.
Well, maybe we should go somewhere else then.
You know, it just occurred to me.

I mean, how am I supposed to recognize you?
Trust me, I'm not gonna be easy... to miss.
Whose side are you on, Blair, huh?
You want to take a bullet for one of your piece of shit lover boy, low lives?
Is that gonna satisfy whatever fucked up female instinct that it is you're dealing with?
Fine, be my guest.
You'll be doing us both a favor.
But I'll be double dipped in shit if I'm gonna let you get somebody killed just because you can't follow a fucking order.
I swear to you Agent Blair,
I swear on my life, I'm gonna bury you.
You're out of my unit, you're out of my city, you're out of my fucking time zone.
They're not even gonna find your body under all the paperwork I'm gonna bury it in.
Your phone sex days are over, you listening to me?
Good evening, welcome aboard.

Good evening, welcome aboard.

- Thank you.

Good evening, welcome aboard.
Excuse me, thanks.
Excuse me.
- This you?

Not meant to be, I guess.
Figures.

I hope not.
Oh, my God, the snobs in first class are already wearing me out.
I'm Claire, by the way.
I don't think we've flown together before.
Is this your first overnight to D.C.?
No.
Well, I'm gonna keep you back here for the whole preflight song and dance with Rick, and then I'm gonna need you to get on food and beverage service, right away.
Okay, thanks.
Excuse me.
I think that's my seat.
Oh, actually, it's the window seat.
Oh, well, I'm already buckled in.
Okay.
Oh, goodness.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be a pain...
Forget it, it's not a big deal.
You're in my seat.
Look, lady, what's the difference?
If you don't want to sit here, you can just sit someplace else.
Listen, you fucker.

My ticket says seat 44A, and you're in my seat.
So you can either move, or I'm gonna rip that stupid, fucking little cat shirt off of your body and shove it up your...
Are we okay here?
This woman threatened me.
Sir, I'm...

Sorry, I have had a long couple of days, and I don't mean to cause any problems, okay?
I just wanted to sit in my seat, which he's sitting in, and just close my eyes and just sleep for five hours.
Sir, could I get you a complementary beverage or some snacks, perhaps?
I'll take a complementary meal.
I'll be right back with that.
I'm gonna need for you to come with me, please.
And... and a seatbelt extender.
Oh, of course.
Sorry, again.
Hi, excuse me, I'm very sorry about that.
I normally...
The way I handled that... normally I handle people much better,
I didn't mean to snap at him.
I think you'll be more comfortable here.
Are you serious?
Well, I can't have you offing my passengers in cattle class.
I thought you were kicking me off the plane.
No.

- Thank you.

Oh, and by the way, I've always wanted to do exactly what you just did back there.
- Thank you so much.

Ah, folks, from the flight deck, this is your captain.
Got a few more minutes here before we push back from the gate.
So, if everybody'd just go ahead and get yourselves comfortable, we'll have you in the air in no time.
We're looking at clear skies ahead.
Flight time should be about five and a half hours.
Welcome aboard.
- Is this your first time?

- Flying business, I mean.

- On the contrary, I...

I think you're right where you belong.
This is really cool.
Terry, Terry Lenix.
Blair, Gretchen Blair
Can I get you a drink, Ms. Blair?
Sure.
- Excuse me, may I have...

- Would you like a towel?

Sir?
Thank you.
Would you like a towel?
So, what are you getting away from?
- Nothing.

Nope.
Okay.
I...

I just...

That's quite all right.

Okay, well, that's not quite what I meant by...
Okay.
I fucked up, and I have to fly to D.C.
and sit behind a desk for the rest of my life, so I'm in no real hurry to get there.
- So don't go.

Forget D.C., stay on the plane and come with me to Paris.
Oh, you weren't kidding about cutting the small talk, were you?
Why not?
Because it's insane.
- That's why.

Maybe up here in business class you can afford to make decisions like that, but back there I kinda have to follow the rules.
People only really follow the rules because they're too afraid to make decisions for themselves.
Well, I work in law enforcement, and they're kinda sticklers about rules.
Can I help you?
I was just wondering where you hide the gun.
All right, everybody, welcome to Speedbird Airlines, great to have you aboard.
If I could just have your attention for a second, we have an important message.
Make some noise!
Hey!

Fuck you!
Yeah, yeah!
Oh... my God.
Yeah!
Yeah!

- Yeah!

The airline that's your home in the sky
You're flying with Speedbird
We hope you enjoy the ride
Put your tray table up!
Welcome to Speedbird
The only thing you need to know
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You're flying with Speedbird...
So, hostage negotiation?
- I never would have guessed.

I probably would have thought something more like meter maid.
Screw you.
I'm actually really good at it.
So you must meet your fair share of unsavory characters.
Yup, all the time.

- So, be honest now.

Do you ever root for them?
- For who?

- No.

No, never.
I mean, you're talking to them, you're building a rapport, you must start to sympathize for them on some level, right?
I mean, there they are, these poor crooks, they're a trapped in a bank or up on some ledge, the whole world against them.
Holding innocent people at gunpoint.
Yeah, yeah, all right, I'll give you that.
- But...

Thank you.
But, there must be some small part of you that every once in a while, deep down... you just want them to pull it off.
I mean, everyone loves an underdog.
Seasoned potatoes...
Couldn't have been that easy.
- Hm?

- Maybe I should get...

Roasted brussels sprouts sound good, and it also comes with the...
Sir.
I'm gonna need you to return to your seat.
Terry, I can't decide.
And they also have strawberry cheesecake.
Now do I get the strawberry cheesecake or the butterscotch pudding?
Are you okay?
I'm fine, thank you.
Controls being merged, 709, 1,000, climbing, 6,000.
So I'm trying to make my decent, and this girl climbs right into my lap.
- Pops off the top.

No, and Cockburn's right there in the jump seat.
He says, "Want me to take her from here?"
So I...
I looked at him and I said, "The girl or the plane."
Speedbird 709 SoCal Radar Contact.

Need another drink?

Do you want me to get you another drink?
I certainly wouldn't have guessed you to be a nervous flyer.
It's not the flying as much as the... the feeling of surrendering control.
Do you want me to get the flight attendant for you?
No.

Well, don't worry.

It's got redundant systems, fly-by-wire controls, built like a tank.
- A tank that can fly.

The FBI uses this aircraft to train for rescue scenarios, and we train for everything.
- Stealth entry, containment...

- It pay you well?

I'm talking, 60, 70,000.
You know, there is a fine line between being eccentric and being rude.
How would you like to be 50 million dollars richer by the time we got off this plane?
I'm sorry, my ears haven't popped yet.
Could you please repeat that?
I'll pay you 50 million dollars, right now, if you'll agree to help me.
That's what I thought you said.
And what is it that you need my help with, exactly?
Getting off this plane alive.
Keep that opened, please.
Ms. Blair, I'm trying to tell you that this plane is about to be hijacked.
The people behind it are not interested in terror, they're not interested in politics.

What people?
One of them is the stewardess.
Flight attendant.

- Flight attendant.

I mean, she's not actually a... a flight attendant.
She's...
- She's... she's what?

Okay.
Something to drink, sir?
No, I'm fine.

Water, coffee, maybe.
No.

It's a long flight, sir.
I won't be coming back through the cabin for a while.
Okay, I'll have a ginger ale.
Here you go, sir.

Thank you.
Okay, now we don't have very much time.
Now, I realize the situation that I'm putting you in...
You really don't.
Do you understand that I can report you for making a threat against this aircraft?
Hey, I'm not the one making threats here.
- I'm the one they're after.

You need to stop this, or I'm gonna go find a flight attendant...
Gretchen, listen to me.
Now, I know these people.

Mm-hm.

Believe me, I'm not.
- But what I'm carrying with me...

I don't even want to hear this anymore.
When I get back, you're gonna shut the hell up, and I'll pretend like we didn't have this conversation, okay?
- Gretchen.

You have to trust me.
Miss?

No, I just think he's had a little too much to drink.
Excuse me.
Hmm.

What are we celebrating?
Hello?
Hello, are you all right?
- You miss me, baby?

Yeah, probably wouldn't.
I like what you've done with your hair.
I said I liked it.
I'm gonna ask you nicely, Terry, once.
- For old times' sake.

- are you remembering, exactly?

If this is about the old espresso machine, I threw it out with the rest of your crap.
Yeah, that's a bit more like I remember it.
Tell me where.
I hate to be the one to break it to you, Sadie, but this plane will never be in the air for long enough for you to find it.
Terry... the plane belongs to us now.
Nothing here.
Give me something here, Sharpe.
Look at this.

Questioning my sense of style now, too?
Style's your problem, Terry.
I mean, you just can't help showing the whole world who you are.
How do you think we found you?
Lesson number one... if you're going to double cross somebody, don't leave them alive to do anything about it.
You'd be the authority on that then.
Let's face it, Terry.

One man could never spend that much money on himself.
Congratulations, Sharpe, you caught me.
A lot of fucking good it does you sealed in a tube 35,000 feet in the air.
You're all out of moves.
This isn't a fucking getaway car shop.
Even if you get into that cockpit, if... the moment this plane goes off course, they'll scramble half the air force to shoot us down.
Well, I agree with you.
But first, they have to find us.
What the fuck is that for?
Well, hi, there, darling.
Sure you're old enough to be flying by yourself?
- What can I get for you boys?

I'll take a pop.
We haven't had you up this way before, have we?
I think you'd remember.
I'm sure I would.
What do you say, Terry?

She should have left well enough alone, Sharpe.
Well enough's got a way of changing, when she gets her hands on a billion dollars.
I thought you were too nice walk away on that, Sharpe.
You shoulda used it.
Now I'm gonna have to take your advice and kill you.
Who are you kidding, Terry?

But you're one hell of a thief, I'll give you that.
You just never knew how to hold on to something that you should have.
Any minute now.
Really?

I could put my kids through college for what this seat costs,
I can't even get a goddamn water!
Anyone.

I'll take the guy.
Really?
Get gold status, my ass.
This doesn't have to be it for us, you know.
Save the charm for your first class skanks.
You do still care.
Maybe I'm approaching this from the wrong angle.
I don't even know who she is.
I guess we'll find out.
The internet isn't working.
Excuse me?

Excuse me?
Oh, my God.
Hey.
Hey, it's you.
I didn't get your name.
Gretchen Blair.

Okay, I'm...

You're the air marshal.
- How'd... how'd you know that?

You need to watch how you carry your gun on the left side.
It's a dead giveaway.

I need you to listen to me very carefully, please.
I think the plane's being hijacked.
Luke...
The plane's being hijacked.
Has a threat been made?
I don't know, but there's a dead flight attendant back there.
This is your first security situation.
It's my third solo flight.
Okay...
I need to secure the cabin.
- Secure the flight deck.

Some of the flight crew might be the hijackers.
Fucking bullshit, man.
Quit complaining, Christ.
You never said nothing about any lame uniforms.
Not that it makes a difference to your Gene Simmons looking ass.
Fuck, this looks stupid.
Control, this is 709.
Because of weather up here, request permission to descent to 28,000.
Roger, Speedbird 709.
Descend and maintain 28,000.
We gotta notify the captain, reroute the plane.
All right.

Please...
I thought Sharpe knew how to fly this fucking thing.
He knows what he's doing.
Which is what, exactly?
Ensuring our passengers' cooperation.
Folks, this is your captain up here in the flight deck.
Sorry for the bumpy ride back there, we're experiencing a small drop in cabin pressure, nothing to worry about.
If I could ask you to remain seated with your oxygen masks on, and I'll have the flight crew come back there and perform a spot check.
I don't think these guys are our flight attendants.
Somebody like to tell me what the hell is going on?
Just stay in your seat, sir.
- What are you doing?

- That's my bag!

Okay?
Hey look!

What do you think he's looking for, a bomb?
- A bomb?

You heard the captain, there is no bomb.
You think they'd tell us if there was one?
I think he's right.
They could be rigging the plane with explosives.
They're not rigging the plane with explosives.
They aren't terrorists.
- I need to get to the flight deck.

Procedure says we secure the flight deck.
They already have the flight deck.
You need to listen to me very carefully.
There is something on this plane that they want.
And we need to find it so we can negotiate with them.
What are you talking about?
The guy that was sitting next to me in first class, offered me a lot of money to help him.
That's who we need to find, fast.
Can you handle the flight attendant?
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Son of a bitch.
All right, everybody calm down.
It's standard aerial procedure.

Air marshal!
- Terry?

- you felt that way about me.

We gotta move.
Gotcha.
- Your ex?

I take it things didn't end well with her?
You have no idea.
Hello.
Terry...
Sharpe.
Sadie, what the hell is going on back there?
Someone cut the power.
Jesus.

Don't be stupid.

I need you to talk me through how to get the lights back on.
Where is he?
Hey, man, I'm done with this.
- I want to see the captain.

- Hey!

He must have got by me.
It's a fucking plane, you idiot.
- Everybody sit down.

All right, he's got to be in here somewhere.
You think?
So go fucking find him.
You assholes had one job.
Everybody, masks off, now!
Oh, but the Captain said to...
- Masks... off... now.

Go.
You!
- I need to see her face.

Hey, get off!
You see the fucking light?
That's what happens when you don't stay seated.
Agent Blair.
I outta kick your ass.
I knew you wouldn't let me...

I thought the deal was supposed to be you saving my ass.
We don't have a deal.
You know, if you wanted to organize some alone time, you coulda just asked.
So, what's the plan?
Well, my clearance was downgraded, so I had to check my service weapon.
So, we need to find my bag.
I want everyone on this goddamn plane accounted for.
Hands out.
Let's see 'em.

Where's the man who was in this seat?
I don't know.
Where the hell is he?
Where the hell is the man who was in this seat?
Who knows?

Where the hell is he?
What, are your arms broken, or what?
- Right.

So what does bag look like?
It's Fendi.
Maybe you don't need money as badly as I thought.
It's a shitty knockoff.
- Matthew.

Still no sign of him.
No sign of him?
What the hell, Sadie?
It's a goddamn airplane.
Is this how you talk to me now?
No, no, I'm sorry.
Good.
Now fly the fucking plane.

Check under the seats, check the lavatories, check anywhere else on this goddamn plane that you can.
Find him.
What the hell?
Move!
Fuck!
You've got to be fucking kidding me.
What the hell happened to you?
I don't know.

You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Do I gotta mark right here?

- Ow, dammit!

I just need a minute.

All right, you've hurt yourself.

Here.
So how's the business class experience working out for you?
Oh, it's... it's been lovely.
Everything I imagined it would be.
Who are you?
- I'm sorry?

Who are you?

What is your involvement with this?
I was their partner.
- You worked together?

What kinda work?
I guess you could say freelancing was a polite euphemism.
Okay, so, you're criminals.
- I like the way I say it better.

You do realize that I'm gonna have to arrest you when this plane lands, right?
Okay, let's just worry about getting back on the ground, first, okay?
No.

Hey, how many times do I have to tell you that I'm not the bad guy here?
Oh, wow!

I love that you actually genuinely believe that.
But to be honest with you, you haven't told me a goddamn thing.
You know, it really was the perfect plan.
Clearly, Terry, this was a perfect fucking plan.
I was the confidence man.
You know, the guy in the suit?

I could tell you where the money was in five minutes flat.
Sharpe...
I mean, the guy that looks like brute, but his mind is like a steel trap.
Any machine you can think of, if they've built it... he can take it apart and put it back together with his bare hands.
Of course, when he uses those hands on people, he can have decidedly human mixed results.
And as for my... ex...
I guess you could call Sadie, the balls.
The balls?
That's really nice.
Hey.
Get down there.
Lenix...
Bring back alive.
The woman?
Break her.
- Get down!

- Yoo-hoo!

Man, you gotta stop doing that.
What?
Finishing my sentences.
People are gonna think we're married or some shit.
I don't think they saw us.
Oh, my God.
I just saw my suitcase, it's right here.
Can you get to it?
Yeah, just keep watching.
Let me...
Tell me if they come.
I got it.
- Oh, shit.

The mag.
Hold on.
Come on.
Gotcha.
You know, I don't impress too easily, but that's pretty fucking cool.
Gretchen... what are you doing?
- Show me.

What's worth hijacking this plane for.
Voila.
What the hell is this?
This... is the last place in the world that anyone would ever look.
What the hell is taking so long?
Don't move.
Start walking.
What are you expecting to accomplish here, Mr. Air Marshal?
You're going to get me inside that cockpit.
You see, the thing about biological material... is it's not subject to your usual screening procedures.
- Something about...

Right.
Tell him to open the door.
There's still a way out of this for you.
Just shut up and tell him.
How much is he paying you anyway?
I fucking mean it.
You have no idea how long I spent on this score.
Some of the things I had to go through.
How dirty my hands had to get.
What the hell is this?
- How much?

Holy shit.
So you fucked over your partners?

You really don't have a very high opinion of me, do you?
You know those guys up there?

They were the ones who stitched me up.

In the front, actually.
What are you doing?
What?

Open the door.

Matthew...
You know what to do.
Hey?
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine...
I just...

- Hey.

I'm just...

Hey, Terry.
- I'll be back.

You'll be safe here.
Terry, help!

Hey, Terry?
Terry?
Byres?
Plane's secure.
It's safe to go upstairs.
I knew you were a good investment.
Sorry, Terry.
You're just not good at picking your partners.
Where's your little traveling companion?
Your goons got to her before I could get to them.
Doesn't matter.

709, I have your altitude at 15,000 and descending.
Do you wish to declare an emergency?
Planning a reroute for you now, 709.

Negative control, my hydraulics are gone.
709, please say again.
- 709, please come in.

Come in. 709...
Eyes on the road, cowboy.
You're gonna wanna see this.
That was almost as good as bad sex.
It's okay...
Thank you, Lord.

Folks, this is from the flight deck.
Sorry for the bumpy landing back there, we had to make an unscheduled pit stop.
So, I hope you're all okay.
We're having our mechanics preform a maintenance check, so just let those boys do their job and... we'll have you on your way in no time.
We are taking off in six minutes, no more no less.
Do it in five.
Shut the fuck up...
Everybody, just sit down and shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!
Do not give me a reason to kill you!
You're a bit of work, Sharpe.
What's that, Terry?
You coulda got away clean.
There's no need for any of this.
You know, best laid plans.
I spent seven years working on that plan.
- The plan was perfect.

Yeah, well, this is as far as you're gonna go.
There's no way outta this.
The people we stole that case from, never could've gone to the police.
They might as well have not existed, but you just stole a plane with 200 people onboard.
There's nowhere to hide that.
Nowhere they won't come looking for you.
They won't be looking at all.
Hurry up.
- We'd all be dead.

Hurry up!
I don't want to be on this fucking plane when it leaves.
When they're done sifting through the wreckage, everybody onboard will be accounted for.
Sadie and myself included.
The black box, the flight recorder...
They'll figure out what happened on this plane.
See... that's the beauty of it.
This plane is gonna be my star witness.
The mechanics are down there right now installing a dummy black box... that's gonna tell a very different story.
As far as the world knows, this plane just experienced hydraulic failure.
Come on, just put it there.
- How are we doing on time?

Hurry up.

Your cut's by the cabin door.

Let's get off this fucking plane.
- Hey, close the fucking hatch.

You know, I gotta hand it to you, Sharpe...
I thought I was the master criminal, but that is some serious... comic book, supervillain shit.
Don't try flattering me.
Clear.
- We all finished back there?

Just go!

Wow, you really do know how to handle people.
Come on.

- Just punch the fucking thing!

Go on, the flight attendant's gonna help you down there.
She'll help you.
Okay, everyone, single file.

I need you to help me get people off of the plane safely.
Come on, let's go, single file.
This way.
Everyone, stay calm.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Come on, go!

Here, give me your hand.

Come on!
Give me your hand.
Come on.
Come on!
You go first.
Go.
Come on.

I can't let you go any further, agent.
- Luke!

What the hell are you doing?
Where are you going?
To find Terry?
Put the gun down, Luke.
How much did he offer you?

You asshole!
Mega Yacht Monthly, huh?

Twenty million?

- A little higher.

Luke!
Luke, we're sworn to protect people!
Shut up!
You know as well as I do, that saving lives doesn't pay for shit.
I don't care about the money!
Yeah?

Come on, you motherfucker!

- How much time?

Rescue, this is control.

Level 3,000, heading 4-2-0.
Speedbird 709...
Sadie!
Sorry, sweetie... you don't belong up here.
You need to adjust your altitude, bitch.
Terry!
I think we should be going!
We lost the other chute.
- Any excuse, huh?

- Let's go.

Here!

Got it.
Ready?
- Set.

Oh, shit.
You never did give me an answer.
About what?
Here, let me take that.
- Um, watch your hand.

Answer about what?
About Paris.
Really?

I'd say we have time.
You know, it's probably weeks before they figure out we weren't on that plane, if they ever do.
So what do you say?
Let's just worry about getting back on the ground first.
