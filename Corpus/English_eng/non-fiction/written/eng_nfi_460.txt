- You are not just a mom.
You are a hot, hot, single lady.
- Oh, god.

- Just a second, sweetie!
You are a well-educated female person...
With a very big...
Set of tits.
- Mommy!

All right, momma's bringing in the big board.

Gracie, do you have your show-and-tell, honey?
Yes, you do.

Will, buddy, helmet and pads?
Are those boys still giving you a hard time at practice?
Okay, well, screw football.
How about glee club, huh?

- Mommy, can we listen to singing music on the way to school?
- No, honey, I like to listen to news in the morning.
- Can I play on your phone?

Amelia!
You know we don't do screams before school.
He took his diaper off!

- Oh!

- Good afternoon, Jen.
Gorgeous day we're having, huh?
Got that sun dialed up to a 10.
It is.

- I probably wouldn't have seen Greyson pick his nose and wipe it on the back of your seat without it, huh?

I got you.

- Hey!

- Owen is begging for a play date with the boys.

- Oh!

Silent.

- Hey, Sally.
- Whoa, uh-- - orange cones, no phones.
- I was buying milk.

- Well, there's a trader Joe's right around the corner.
- Yeah, well, i don't do markets, okay?
So please just give me my phone, Melissa.
Uh, uh, melody.
I mean...

God, we've been going to the same school for five years?
- Just give me my phone, please, Melanie.
Hey, what the...?
- Are those car seats even installed properly?
And does this beauty even have anti-lock brakes?
- Yes.

And power windows.
- Seriously?
- We have a big day and then teacher Sherry witnessed Amelia offering her spot on the green rug.
The empathy that displays, Amelia, it's... it's profound.
Come on, you two get in here.
You both are settling in beautifully to your first month at school.

- Yeah.

All right, bug, come on.

- Have an amazing day.

- Yay!

Rose-budding really takes it to the next level.
- Rose-budding!
Ooh, that'll get a lot of likes, right?
- Now I get the iPad, mommy?

As soon as we get in the car.

- Can't even remember what that's like.
- Hey, I know this is kind of last minute, but Melanie - you know, grace's mom?

I got us a reservation in this new tapas place.
Would you wanna join?

- Yeah, topless place, i thought, you know, sexy dancers, little appetizers.
No.

- Tapas.

Yeah, no, tapas.

- Yeah, we like to do this fun mom dinners every couple of weeks.
You know, lots of wine, no kids.

- Yeah, sounds like it.

- Hey, Mel, guess what.

- Oh, fantastic.

I love welcoming new moms to the happy days community.
I can't wait to hear your story, Emily.
- Um, would it be okay if I invited Kate?
- Kate with the twin boys?

- Wait.

- Yeah, yeah, we went to high school together.
That's how I got Amelia in here so last minute when we moved.
- Kate doesn't usually do stuff with us other moms, or even return my emails, but I know she got it, 'cause I have that sent-return thing.
But since you guys are so close, if you wanna invite her,
I mean, that's fine, she could come with us, yeah.
- That'd be wonderful.

That sounds great.

Got to go.

- I like your skirt.

- I bet my left tit that bitch Kate doesn't come.
- Hello, gorgeous.
Shut up!
- Mom!

I'm in the playoff!
Where are you?

Where are you?

- Whoa, whoa!
One at a time, dudes, one at a time.
- Make them shut up, okay?

- The twins knocked over my legos and I have to poop.
- Oh, get in here, go.

- He took my sabre!

- Okay.
There you go.

Have fun.
Daddy's calling you.
Hey.

I can't take hanging around that place.
- Oh, guess who got apoopfacial andtaughtourkid howtosaythe fword ?
- Oh, wait, you had shit on your face and you're worried your kid learned the word fuck?

I never swear in front of them, is the thing.
- Mm, shit, I'd be more worried about pink eye.
- How is it possible thatthiskid still has the s-h-i-t-s?
- Well, now you know what you're really missing out on when you're pulling those 12-hour workdays.
- It's incredible to me that my life still revolves around other people's s-h-i-t.

- Oh, I can.
- You're good at this.
Do it again?

- I love it, Emily.
You look beautiful.

I feel like you've just never seen me with my hair brushed.

Hey...

- Daddy's home!

How you doing?

Oh, gosh, are we busy making some drawings here?
What the...
Wow, honey, this is, um...
This is an interesting one.
What exactly is going on here?
- It's a whale spraying mommy.

I...

All right.
- Oh, sorry.

Okay, I'm gonna, uh...

- He's got this thing about messing up my lipstick.
- Is this, like, top chef or something?
Are we gonna be judged on our work?

- No, it's a delivery thing, man.
It's a startup, which I should've invested in.
It's all local and organic and sustainable.
And they just drop it off for you.
- What drops it off, an electric tractor being pulled by a rescue dog?
Thanks, Kate.
- This is literally farm to table, you guys.
Farm to table.
- Straight from the farm.

- Right to the table.

- There's no middle man.

Well, thank you so much for having us over so we could make our own dinner.

- Kate, I think it's awesome, i think it's super creative, and I like it.
- Thanks, em.

- All right.

Right.

- What's up with the sauce?
- Just a little-- - oh, no, no, no, hold on.
Throw the veggies in first and then the sauce goes--

You know, sometimes, recipes are in a specific order for a reason.
It's gonna screw the whole thing up if...

- It cooks together...

- Did you guys...
Do you have any of that yellow sauce leftover?
- Mm-hmm, yep.

Um...
Yeah, I think, uh, this move is gonna be great for us.
- Yeah.

We get to hang like the old times, just the girls.
- Speaking of just the girls, a couple of the moms from school asked me out for a fun mom dinner.
- That sounds awful.

How can it not be, you know, fun?
- Shut the fuck up, hon.

- One of them was named Jamie.
- I know her.

I follow her on instagram.
She's a bit of an over-sharer.
- Seriously, Andrew?

I think I'm just embarrassed for you.

- Whoa.
- #sharedcustody?
#metime?
Fuck, if it's me time, why feel the need to share it with us?
Who's the other mom?

- Okay, that woman is bad-shit crazy.
I think she runs a fight club in the helping hand yard.
- No, they're trying to be nice.

Just say Wyatt's sick or something.
- No, don't listen to her, em, and you should go too, babe.
- Honey, I think this is great.

Widen your circle?

- Yeah, maybe it is sexual.

- You're just gonna widen it, take a look around.
- Oh!

Of sexual innuendo...

- What is it?

It's our sex questionnaire from sophomore year.
- We answered every question with Jake Ryan.
Yes!

- The I love who?
- Jake Ryan from sixteen candles.

Jake Ryan is like the perfect guy.
- I've never heard about any of this.
- There were two presidents and two members.
- You guys started a club and there's only two people in it?
That's adorable and sad.

- Yeah, you two can't be in the club.

- Hey.

- All yours.
You wanna watch a little John Oliver?
- No.
Oh, hey, would you mind taking Amelia to school tomorrow so I can go work out?
- No... fucking... way.
- What?
- Mommy!
- Hey, shhh, shhh, shhh...
Mommy's here.
Don't forget to go pee-pee.

- Did you really just tell me to go pee-pee?
- I did.

- Oh!

- Oh, that is so wrong.
- You push out two more kids and see if you don't need one.
Hey, what's going on with you?
Tom stuff again?
- No.
Yes.
- You seemed happy last night.
Please tell me you went home and had drunk sex.

Tom has zero interest in sex.

I haven't had a hug in months.

- The last hug I got, I think, was from teacher Sherry.
Kind of felt a little something.
Okay, ladies, positions, please.
Come on, ladies, positions, please.
- We need to talk about this.

I wanna see those knees to cheeks.
Five, six, seven, eight, and go down, down, down, down, down, down!

- Good thing this is an overnight.
- Whoo!

Ooh, higher!

Whoo!

- I do not get this.

I'm stuck.
Hey, good timing, i just got a text from Kate a minute ago who's gonna be here in five, so...

We're gonna go hang out over there for a bit.
- Oh, are you sure it's a good idea, 'cause it's a school night, and you know if Wyatt falls asleep in the car, he's never gonna transfer.
- Yeah, it will be great, babe.

- No, you don't get to do the "we never have fun anymore" thing.
I'm babysitting tonight so you can go out and have fun.
- You're babysitting, tom?

- It's not babysitting when they're your kids.
- Yeah, it is.

- You're splitting hairs there, but, yeah, sure, I mean, both.
- His green blanket is in the dryer.
Do not forget it if you go out.

Are you listening to any of this right now?
- Come on.

- Okay.

I need to take a quick shower.

Good luck with that.
Have a good night.

- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
- But I was just thinking i needed to take a quick shower.
- Please.

- Tell me you didn't do this.
- I kind of did.
- Looks like your classic ambush move.
- That Emily is sneaky.
- I like her.
- I thought this was just gonna be the two of us, talking about you and tom and shitty life stuff.
- I know.

I'm sorry I tricked you, okay?
I just wanted a night where i am not thinking about tom.
I need it.
- Oprah?

Care to open up your friendship circle?
Let's go, come on.
- One hour, that is it.

- Come on.

- Melanie, you look hot.

- I mean, what else are we supposed to bring to snack share?
I mean, we've got three kids allergic to gluten, a tree nut, two soys, and that kid with the zipper thing?
- Oh, that kid is not allergic to zippers.

- But it's on the list.

That's more of an emotional allergy.
- Yes, I did the rotc thing in college, and I came this close to joining the armed forces, you know?
I still think about it.
You cannot get me out of my 'tigues on the weekends.
- I miss telling people at parties that I was a lawyer, you know?
Except for I never went to parties, because I never left the office before 9:00.
And then there was, like, the rare occasion that I did make it home by bedtime and Amelia was calling her nanny "mama."
- Now that Lexie is with Theo part of the time, i actually have time to myself.
So I started consulting with this engineering firm.
Plus I'm training for a half-marathon, and I get to sleep - and I'm talking real sleep.
- Now, that is why you look so good.

You know, she would never admit it, but she was my saving grace.
Some of my friends got so weird after I got separated.
You would not believe, once you're single, that these ladies do not want you around their husbands.
I never saw it coming with my friends, but not Melanie.
You were always inviting me out all the time.
Sometimes, she even had to use brute physical force to get me out of the house.
- That I believe.

What should we talk about, Kate?
You know, so we're interesting to you.
I mean, we've all shared.

- Melanie.

That's a little harsh, don't you think?
- I don't, actually.

It's true.

What can I say?

First there were the moms from when Lucas started school, and then the Sam moms, more play dates, more school meetings, the juicing, the coffees.

I don't wanna know what birthday parties are being planned.
I don't give a fuck about the best mommy and me yoga or mommy and me anything.
And I especially don't wanna hear that super-cute thing their kid said, did, wrote, or fucking sang,
I mean, come on, do you want me to go on?
- No, that's okay.

But just for the record, Melanie and I do not juice.
- I knew you were a bitch.

- Melanie, I'm sorry, i know you don't like me because I'm not engaged and involved in- no, no, no, no, no, no.

My problem with you is that you walk around like you're too good to do any shit at all.
- You took my phone yesterday, for fucksake.

Jesus, just admit you take stuff a little too far.
- When you admit that you were texting and driving.

A mother can never run out of milk!
- Come on.

This is bullshit, I'm done here.

- No, Melanie, come on.

I love that you're a traffic-safety person.

- Come on, you don't wanna miss the tartufo.

I want my tartufo.

Because then you got your something sweet and you got something to cut the sweet.
She should leave.
- Oh, with pleasure.
- Oh, uh...
She drove.

- Mel, this is not good.

- Fine, but I cannot believe I'm missing forensic files for this shit.
You know, order me a scotch.
Three fingers, y cube.
- Don't even think about trying to convince me to come back in.
- Don't worry.
I'm just gonna wait here a minute and then tell them i couldn't find you.
What the hell is that?
- Something you could desperately use.
Here, peace pipe.
- So basically you just need to choose the picture you want- oh, my god.

- I did?

- Yikes.

Ah, dating at my age?
Why do all the men look like weary grandpas?
- No, no, no, no, come on.

Let's start with looking.
He's cute.
- I used to smoke the doobage from time to time.
Yeah, right, I'll toke up.
But you're still a massive cunt.

- I'm guessing you haven't done this in a while.
- Yeah, it's been like 15 years.
- Here's how it works in the 21st century.

- Yeah.

- Okay.

Okay, now we're cooking with gas.
That's a friend I remember.
Wow.

- Wait, I'm confused.

Because there is a big difference between the two.
- True.
Although sometimes in the dark my husband can't tell.
- Have you heard anything about a... fight club on the helping hand yard?
- Huh?

- Hi.

- What'd we miss?

- Good evening.
- Oh, we're gonna need a bigger boat.
- Yeah, I think we need one more of, uh...
Everything.

- Everything.

- Oh, I'm so glad we're doing this.
And Emily acted like it was gonna be so hard to bring the kids over here.

Kate gets like that too sometimes, like super wound up about stuff.

- Yeah.
Oh, what's going on, buddy?
Oh, okay.
All right.

- Blankie?
His blankie?
His blankie.
Oh, fuck.
- Marijuana makes me really paranoid, but I'll take a little puff.
Yeah, Jamie.
- Pass that.

- Mm, yeah.

- Brazilian's retro now?
- Oh, not even.

- What?

- Look at this.

- Oh, my god!

- Very popular now.

She shaves off all the hair on her vagina god's given her and takes a handful of crystals and some Elmer's glue and sprinkles up a little design?
Is that what she does?
What kind of woman wants sand on her vagina-- what are you doing in there?
I see a lot of feet.

Hi.

What a cute little outfit.
Is it your birthday?
- Are you smoking in here?

- You know what?

- Hey, wait a minute.
I have an idea.
How about we send an ice-cream sundae over to your table?
You know, like a little surprise for keeping a secret?
- I want a steak.

- New York strip, medium rare.
And a coke.

Great talking to you.
- That little girl is fucking intense!
If that's what I'm missing out on then, no, thank you.
- Oh, no.

- Oh, shoot!

- Okay!

- Let's go through the back.

- Oh, my god!
- Do you hear that?

- Ladies, I believe this is a dine-and-dash situation.

If we're staying out later, i got to text my hubby.
- Oh, good idea.

- Okay.
Oh, wait!

Come here.

Do you mind if we make a quick pit stop?
I love me some walgreens.

Boom, i got a motherfucking gift card!
- Hey, bud, see this is same colour as your blankie.
Maybe that works.

Nope.

- Daddy, you promised i could watch it.
Please, please, please!
- I know, honey.

Hey, come with me.
This way, please.
- Where are we going?

Right in here, my man.

- Bring him on in.

- Sure.

- Don't question me.

That's what I thought.

- I got myself involved in the swing set.
Can I have that, please?

I know.

You might wanna get yourself like a soft, fuzzy blanket, instead of this piece-of-shit towel.
- Yeah, I forgot the blanket.

- Oh.

All right, watch and learn.
Watch.
- What?
Whoa.

That is fucking incredible.
- Oh, hey, here's our car.

- Yeah!

- Uh, to get around?
- No, no, it's good, all right?

We're gonna leave the cars there to deflect.
And that's our little Katie right there, 'cause, whoo, yeah, you got our six!
- I don't even know what you're talking about!

- Oh, come on, that's military jargon, right?

- Yeah, six is back.

- Roger that, you crazy cunt.

- Wow.
- Guys, I got a bad feeling about getting in these things.
You hear about these guys, they ride around all day, and they pick up the last ride and just snap like crazy.
- They do not.

- Man, Jamie, you weren't messing around when you said you get paranoid.
- I know.

I always had Theo with me when I got high.
He took care of me when I started to get like this.

- I'm gonna be your person.
You don't have to worry.

- Thank you.

- That was a fun night, you guys.
- Em, there's no fucking way I'm doing bedtime tonight.
I mean, if I am staying out with you gals, i need to get more supplies.
- Ooh, I better stay out here.

- No, we're sticking together.

Come on, don't worry about it.
It's like crabtree Evelyn, but with weed.
- All right.
- For fucksake, Wayne, you know who I am.
Now please, just play nice.

- Oh, very nice.

I am your marijuana sommelier for the evening.
Oh, and here's Brady.

- He's my partner.

- Brady!

Hi, guys.

- Hey, look, anything you want, we've got it.
If we don't have it, we'll grow it.
If we can't grow it, we're gonna get it from some factory in some godforsaken land.
- You know what, you know what?
I think we should set them up with our selection of stuff that's for mothers, 'cause, you know, we love the mothers.
- We love our mothers.

- Sounds good.
- Let's begin with this one.
I think you might enjoy.

- You guys fans of supreme court justices?
- Oh, yeah.

It's now Ruth bader ganja.

We were playing around with John Stevens for a while, but we couldn't really think of anything for that.
- But for you i think it's very good,
- because it will get you...

- But at the same time, you'll still be able to mediate family disputes or decide on what you might be cooking or...
- It's also a really fun weed when you need to concentrate.
You can build a castle out of legos.
You can play with calico critters all night.
Shopkins, and you have total concentration.
- We put just a pinch of Adderall in there, which gives you just that extra dash of focus.
- What?

- But maybe can we talk about edibles?
- Oh.

Which, by the way, reminds me, do any of you have glaucoma?
If so, we are giving away some free gummy worms.
- I have glaucoma.

- You have glaucoma?

You don't have glaucoma.

You guys are so our speed.

- 'Cause you play around, you can joke, you have a good- we do the same thing.

- It's so crazy.

- And the wives are, like:

- Don't hang out with them much, but these are really good.
These are called good night moons.
You know the children's book, good night moon?
- Of course.

- And we went ahead and added the s.
You know, good night moons.

- This is delicious.

Somebody's discovered our balls.
We make those here - oh, I like it.
- It will fuck you up.

- You know how you have that concentrated detergent.
"This one little thimbleful for the whole washer?"
But yeah, because it's that concentrated.
- How much of your own products do you get your little paws into?
- Oh, we don't smoke.

- Are you kidding me?

- My only addiction is mad men.

- He loves it.

- Tom.

Kate's partying with the school moms.
It's on the bubble-bath chick's instagram.
- You know, it really is embarrassing that you follow her.
- Yeah.

- Okay, I gave Amelia a five-minute warning.
- Oh, oh, grab that door, grab that door!

- Uh... it locks when it's not supposed to.
That's my fault.

We are momentarily locked out.
- What do you mean, momentarily locked out?
- What I said:

Why don't we just do this?
Why don't we just let them finish their movie in there, and me and you will chill out here with Wyatt?
- Oh, yeah, well, actually, i was hoping to get the kids home before Emily got back.
- Oh, well, Kate texted and said they were gonna stay out later.
- What?

I think I'm supposed to tell you that.
- Okay.

- Mm...
I haven't licked a ball in a decade.
- It got you your divorce.

- I never blew Theo.

- And divorce.
- Sometimes it's just easier, you know, like a quick one during a commercial break of kimmel.
Andrew's psyched and I don't have to have him lying all over me.
- I hear that, sister.
My preference is antiques roadshow.
There's no commercials, but I just pop down there.
Me blowing those nuts.
I'm back in time for the ming dynasty office.
- Oh, lord, well, just imagine having to be single again.
It's all back on the table for me now.
What if I have to do anal again?

Maybe you'll meet the guy that makes you wanna do anal again.
- Thank god I never did.
- Emily's one of those rare angels who actually married the first guy she had sex with.
- What?

- Don't hit me!

- You guys, i think we're being followed.

Do you hear the footsteps?

- I think you've had one too many licks.
How about we get a drink over there, cool out for a bit?

- Oh, we got a runner!
- Shit.
- Excuse me.

Excuse me.
Oh, wow.
You have beautiful, beautiful bone structure.
- Thank you.
How about a coke?

Actually, I was gonna get a vodka-and-tonic, because it's transparent.
That way if some weirdo tries to slip something in it, i can see it to protect myself.
- Okay, how about a sprite?

- I'd love a glenlivit, one cube.

- And can we grab two house whites?
- House whites, all right.

Let me guess...
Mom's night out?
- Again?

- Should we be offended you just immediately assumed that we are all moms?
- No.

- It says moms.
- Yeah, I got two of them.

- Good eye, by the way.
Usually, people don't notice that.
- I got a thing for details.

I'm Emily.

- Luke as in...
This your place, Luke?
- That's me.

A little help over here?
- Excuse me, ladies.

- What's gotten to you, em?

- Weed.
I am so sorry that I tricked you into tonight.
- Ah, you know what?
I hate to admit it, but I'm having a great time.
- It's kind of a perfect night, right?
- You know what would make it even more perfect, would be if Jake Ryan just like wandered in here.
- Oh, god, Jake Ryan.

I love that guy!
Sixteen candles.
- Oh, for me that was all about Anthony Michael hall.

- Farmer Ted.

- You do not!

- Oh, my god!

- No, I have to say, for me, Jake Ryan, he was my ideal.
He ruined romance for me.

- It's true, because no guy could ever live up to him.
No guy ever will live up to him.
- Well, he's a character in a movie.
- I always liked some kind of wonderful.
- Some kind of wonderful.

Eric stoltz, Lea Thompson- no, Eric stoltz, Mary Stuart Masterson.
- Yes!

God, Mary Stuart had that killer little haircut.
- Super cute.

Excuse me?

- Check you out.

- Oh, I am not.
I mean, a little bit of male attention might be just what you need tonight.
- How do you feel about two delicious ice-cold beverages?
- Yeah, all right.

In the shed.
Let me know if you get just a hint of bacon in there.
- Whoa.

- That's a lot of bacon.

- This is like a, um...
Some sort of like a bacon... juice thing?
- That's beer.

- Yes, you dick.

- Did you really not know that this was beer?
- Can you carbonate it?

- This is all great feedback.
- You want me to keep going?

I think I got your gist of it.
These girls are having a blast.
- What... what is it?
- They keep posting to insta.
- Well, Emily's certainly having a blast.

- I think they're just having some drinks, man.
And if I know Kate, she's super stoned by now.
That guy looks like a bartender.
They're having fun.
- Fun.

We don't have... fun anymore, like we never have fun.
- What do you think?

- Well, I mean, you know, I'm pretty stressed out, you know... generally, I guess.
- What?

Don't say that about yourself.

Well, look, I'm running, like, 11 different projects at work, and on the phone, dealing with like building codes and contractors and asshole clients in like five states.
- That fucking blows.

So, you know, when I get home, i don't wanna deal with anyone.
- Right.

- Fuck.

It's not the high point of our relationship.
- Yeah.
Look, man, I think that you guys need to cut yourself a break while you're still in the trenches and the kids are so young.
You know, try to just laugh at some of the bullshit and not be angry at each other, like, all the time.
- So, like, lower the bar?
- Yeah.

- You're really lowering the bar.
- Just keep it realistic.

- Not that...

- I need a lot of room, though, because I tend to do this a lot.
- That's good.

- That's a gorgeous beer.
- You are so resourceful.
- Mm...
- I mean, our philosophy is, if we can stay pretty much into each other, three or four months out of the year while keeping our kids alive, teaching them to be semi-decent human beings- right.

- Huh.
Now, those three or four months, are they, like, spread throughout the year, or are those consecutive?
- Spread throughout the year.

- I'm getting so many likes from my rose-budding post.
A lot of new friend requests, too, but weird ones like hard4buttz.
Buttking343, assmeanything.
- Okay, Jamie, let me see this post.
Okay.

- When you throw the roses...

I think you should take this post down and don't accept any of these friend request, because these people are not your friends.
- I'm so tired all the time.

It sounds like a joke, but it's not.
I literally can fall asleep while I'm pooping on the toilet.
- Okay, well, this isn't a joke.
I would like you to teach me how to do that.
- Okay.

I would love to.
- Oh, wait, wait.
It's my mother-in-law.
- Please don't answer and kill this sweet buzz.
- Never.

- Oh, fuck, trust me.
- I love Halloween candy.

- Actually...
These are the kids' from last year.
- One time, Theo, his mom and i were sitting on the couch watching a movie.
I was massaging Theo's back and his shoulders, and all of a sudden i feel something.
It was his mom's hand.

We were both massaging him at the same time.
- Oh, my god!

- So awkward!

What is it with mothers and their sons?
- Check this out.
You see this?
I got this last Thanksgiving fighting with my mother-in-law over who was gonna make the cranberry sauce.
That woman has got lifeless eyes, black eyes,
American girl doll Jess McConnell eyes.
- Oh!

- Yeah?

- Okay, ladies, here's what I figured out.

But we are all gonna end up just like our mothers-in-laws.
- No fucking way.

Fucking way, fucking way.

I can already tell, I can!

Fuck his wife.

- Yeah, well, try having four.

- As far as I'm concerned, they can move in with their future wives anytime now.
- Oh, you think so?

- Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

Show me.
- Oh, god!
- Jamie just looked up rose-budding.
- Delete.

- It's an anus.
- Okay, tom.
I think I'm ready to share something with you that might just help with that Emily situation.
It's a little trick that I call "two cs a day."
Have you heard of that?
- No.

- Cs like compliments?
- So you give Kate two compliments every day?
- That's right.
So, for example, I'll do one c like straight out of the gate.
I'll do a c about usually her physical appearance, you know.
Like, what she's wearing or how she looks, something like that.
But you wanna try to use the words "beautiful,"
or "hot," or "sexy," something like that.
Don't ever say "nice" or "pretty." They don't like that.
Then later on in the day, i try to follow up with another c, but this is more of an appreciation c, like: "How am I so lucky to be in this with you?"
You know, but super Sincere.

I'm starting to feel a little bit guilty about it, because I'm now getting so much out of it.
- Like blowjob?
- Yeah, like blowjobs.

- Yeah, while I'm watching kimmel.

Where did you get this idea?
- We had a big fight and she was, like:
"I don't feel like you even appreciate me.
Why don't you say one nice thing to me every single day?"
- Okay, all right.

- No, she said one a day, i upped it to two.
- All right.

- Whatever do you mean?
- Wow, clearly you were an extra on cocktail, tom cruise.
- Close.

- Wow.

Summer on the shore.

- That's a pretty good gt.
You make this for your husband when he comes walking through the door?
- Not lately.
- Oh, excuse me.

God, I'm gonna kill them.
- Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, please direct your attention to centre stage, because, yes, it is that time:

Karaoke hour!
- All right.
This one is for you...

Moms, you're on!
- Oh, shit.
- Oh!
- Fuck, yeah.
- Come on, you nailed it.
Let's go.
Whoo!
- Remember this?

We got this, we got this, we got this.
- Jamie, come here!
- Mel, get up there, baby.
- Give me some English so I can read this shit.
- But, yeah, if I'm gonna get khakis,
I want them to be, like, a nice tan- they have...

- Dad!

- Hey, honey-- - can you guys grab the door closed?
- Too late.
- We're hungry.
- Hey, let me grab that spare key real quick.
- All right.

- It was awesome.

- Nope, this is not it.

Fuck.

So what are you saying, that we're locked out?
- Yeah, tom, we're locked out, but what's more important is we don't own a dog.
- Okay.

Gross.
- Okay.

- Come on!

- Dude, this is not good.
So you're saying that we're actually locked out, like for sure?
- Tom, calm down.

I'm pretty good in a crisis.

Guys!

Oh, no!

We're locked out!

Well, your dad and i are gonna protect you, okay?

So don't worry, don't worry!
The bad news is, we're locked out until mom gets home!
Oh, but the good news is we got candy.
Yay!

- Okay, guys, this is my second move.

I'm not on the dance floor.

I'm doing my thing.

He comes up behind me, he wraps his arms around me.
I say, "oh, no Romeo!

- Oh, no, Romeo!

Oh, my god, oh, my god.
- Oh!

All right.
I'm good.

- I'm good.

- Oh, you don't have nothing to be sorry about.
That felt good in a way.
- That's the "oh, no, Romeo." Yeah.
- So where are you taking me?
- Truth?

- Good to get outside sometimes.
Get away from the bar, get some fresh air.

- It's really a nice night.
Good breeze.
- You're very cute, you're very funny, and you're very smart.
And I'll have you know, i take my breaks very seriously.
But I had a feeling about you and I'm just happy that you came out with me tonight.
And I apologize in advance for this.
This is a disgusting, terrible habit.
Don't judge me.

No.

- Look, we can relive your old glory days right now.
Nobody's watching.

I won't tell.
- Oh, god.
I shouldn't.
It's been years.
- Yeah, you're probably right.

Although it's kind of sexy in like a fucked-up '70s kind of way.
- You're funny.
- Ooh, you don't have a lighter by chance, do you?
- Do I have a lighter?

That's a dumb question.

- So... what about you?

Ever been married?
- Nah.
I came close... to both, but I just think the lifestyle i was leading in the bar, and, you know, all the things going on, it was just never very conducive to any of that.
But enough about me.

Emily, the bartending lawyer, who's been married for how many years?
- Truth?
- Truth.
- I have been with my husband since college.
It's boring and predictable, right?
- Uh, no.
If boring and predictable is your thing, then you're... killing it.
See, it's not so bad.

- I get it.

- Is that a fresh tone?
This is me.

- Oh.

- Get out, get out, get out, get out.
Ooh.
- This is pretty weird that we're all laying in the car together.
- Yeah.

- It's... unexpected.
- Where did you learn that word?
- From mommy.

- Oh, mommy has a word of the day, huh?
- Daddy, I'm cold and it smells like Wyatt's poop in here.
- Oh, wow.
Is that what that terrible smell is?
- No, I thought it was Andrew.
- You're funny.

Hey, hon.
I'm sorry.
You know, it's my fault that we are stuck out here, and I know this is not the kind of thing that would happen on mommy's watch.
She's pretty good at this stuff, huh?
- I like it when you're the mommy too sometimes, daddy.
- Whoo!
- Thank you so much.
I'll go check.
You, I like you.

Your dreams are about to come true!
- Luke's gone too.

Have you seen where Emily went?

I'm gonna do a quick perimeter check.
- Excuse me, where's Luke?

- They left like 20 minutes ago.
I mean, he said he'd be back, though.
But, you know, he did check to make sure I was closing up.
So they're probably...
- Oh, my god.

She would tell me if she was leaving.

- He didn't say.

- I feel like something's wrong.
- You felt like something's wrong all night.

- She's not responding.

- What's your name?

- Okay, I'm Melanie.

Is this a regular thing he does, leaving the bar with a lady friend?
- He's done it a few times before.
- Great.

Cooperation's really key here.

- I'd like you to go in your purse, grab your phone, call Luke, have him bring Emily back right now.

- I can't.

- You don't know me, do you?

- Jamie here knows me.

- Jamie tell al what I'm like when I'm mad.

- I think you'd like to call your boss, okay?
Because you can cooperate, or I can have the atf here first thing in the morning investigating you serving all these minors.
- We don't serve minors here.

- No.

They will shut this fucking place down while they investigate the charge.
You think Luke is gonna like that?
- What are you, a cop?

- No.

Okay, get on that fucking phone.

- Okay, I'll be back.

I mean, they were flirting all night.
- I am telling you, i know Emily.
- Wait!

I've been setting instagram up for her earlier.
Let me check.

Are you telling me you can track somebody else's phone?
- Yes, I can pretty much do anything on one of these.

- Well?

- I can't tell you.

- Forget about it.

They're on flanders Avenue heading south.
- Okay, ladies, this is really happening.

- Let's go, let's go!

- Um...

I've had nothing but five coconut waters tonight, so...
I'm Barry, by the way.

- Yeah, I don't think we really got to introduce ourselves officially, so hello.
- Let's go!

- Okay, I got a read.

- Should we call tom?

We don't know what we're dealing with yet.
- Oh, guys, you don't know her.

- Kate, I hate to say it, but they seemed pretty into each other.
- I got her.

It looks like they're heading to the Marina district.
- Okey-dokey.

Come on.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.
- Leave me the fuck alone already!
- What?

- Fuck, was that her?

- The signal stopped at the Marina.
- Okay, we're tracking her, we're closing in, and we're gonna get out of whatever situation she's in.
Are you cool?

Barry, you need to move this motherfucker!
I've been in golf carts faster than this!

- I'm sorry, my foot is cramping up!

- A white Van.

- One second, one second, just got to adjust here.

- Wait, no, this is not the time.
- No, I can just-- - oh, oh, my god!
Barry, just park the fucking car, man!
- I know, I know.

Emily?

Oh, shit.
- Emily!
- Emily?

- Emily?
- Jesus h.

Is that fucker taking her out in the water?
No, I really don't like this.

- It's zero dark 30.

Mission is a go.
Holy shit.
- That woman is certifiable.
- I got you, motherfucker!
- No.
She's incredible.
She's got our six.
She's saving my friend.
Wait.
My friend.
- Unbelievable!

- Oh!

Come on, I got you!
I got you, come on.

- Holy shit.
It's fucking freezing.
- You are one gutsy bitch.

- I wish you'd consider co-chairing the spring auction with me.
- Well, can we do this later?

- Oh!

- Looks like I might've targeted the wrong vessel.
- You think?
- Let's get out of here.

- God, it feels so good...
Just to be the old me for a few hours.
You know, not, like...
Mommy or...
Anything.
Just...

- Hmm.
I'm a huge fan...
Of just Emily.
- Yeah?

- Oh, I...

It was so fun at the bar, and... and it has been a really long time since anyone has kissed me like that, but my...

I am super married and... ew.
I'm sorry.

Where am I?

- What?

- What?

- I kissed you.

I'm so sorry.
- For what, stopping?

- That's funny.

I've been a wake-up call for a few married women in my life.
It's not... it's not the end of the world.
- I got to go, I got to go.

I have to wake up in the morning, because it's a school morning, so I got to go.

- What?

But you should kiss your husband like that, by the way.
- So you see anything out there?

- Yeah.
I'm not worried, i think you're friend probably has Luke, like, hog-tied and begging for mercy by now.
- Oh, yeah?

- I got to say, uh, you ladies are something else,
I love it.

- So you're all... married, then?
- Oh, well, they are.

- Oh, really?

- I mean...

That's too bad.

I mean, is it too bad?
- No, it's certainly better than being married to my ex, that's for sure.
- Right, yeah, good.

- Not bad.

- Right.

- I would say I'm definitely happier.
Yeah.

- So what about you?

- No, not right now.

- So how did you get stuck being the designated driver tonight?
- Oh, I volunteered.

- Yeah, yeah.

It makes me feel all weird in my head, you know.
Are you cold?

- A little chilly there.

- Here.

- Well, Melanie?

- I'm waiting.

- Jaws jokes.

- Oh, you're right.
Shit.

Come on.

- Oh...
I have never felt so sober in my entire life.
- Correct.

Come on.

- Whenever.

Come on, come on.
- I love peanuts so, like, a peanut beer, is that a thing?
- Fuck, yes.

Take that one step further.
What if it's like a whole line of, like, stadium flavours?
- Right.

- Mustard beer.
- Why aren't we writing this down?
- I don't know. 'Cause...

- All right, someone tooted.
- Yeah, it was probably all of them.
- How dare you fart on me?
- When my kids fart...
- Don't even finish the sentence.
- Dude, dude, dude, dude, i...

- What do you binge on?

I try to watch what I eat, watch my weight so...
- Oh, no, I mean, like, like, binge watch.
Like netflix?

- Oh, yeah.

No, I, um, I don't really do any of that stuff.
I'm more of a regular cable-TV guy.
- Oh, I love regular cable TV.

- As a matter of fact, this is so embarrassing, but I actually fall asleep watching hgtv.
- Oh, my god, me too.
Almost, like, every night,
I fall asleep watching love it or list it.
- I love that show!

- Ever noticed how they always choose to love it?
- Yes!

- Every time.

I think they're gonna list it, and then they love it, then sometimes I'm, like:

- I think you're an old soul, Barry.
- Old soul?

I like that.

The last girl I dated told me
I reminded her of a bashful predator.
- Where are all of my friends?

They actually went bonkers.

- What?

- Don't worry about it.
I'm...

Just hang out here for a little bit.
- No, I got to...

Just... okay.

I don't have my phone.

- Use my phone.

I don't want any trouble.

- Um...

- You don't know your friend's number?
- No, I don't know my friend's number!

- Truly, just trying to be helpful.
- Who knows anybody's phone number anymore?

- Oh, my god.

- Who's Barry?

- Barry is my buddy, and he took all your friends looking for you.
- Looking for me where?

- I don't have my phone.
Fuck.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

Are you kidding me with that phone?
- What?

Really?

- Yeah.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- It's go time.
- I'm right behind you.
- Nice aft.

If she came here willingly, I'll fucking kill her.
- Emily!

- Ah... oh, my god, we were so worried.
They still haven't come back.

Oh, you guys better get help.

- Well, there's got to be Marina security.

- That's a good idea.

- Jamie.

Where was the last place that you saw them?
- Down there.

- Okay, where the fuck is Emily?

- Hey, get off my boat.

- Uh, Mel, let's just go.

- It's my dad's boat, but I'm gonna need you to leave.
- Bae, be nice.
They're homeless.
- We are not homeless.
- You must be hungry.

- Okay, now's not the time.

Somebody tell me what's going on here.
- It's senior skip tomorrow, so we're having a party.
- This is a party?

- Oh, my god!

- Emily!
- We saw your unicorn hanging over the side!
- Where the fuck have you been?

- Uh, James, what are all these old-ass milfs doing on the boat?

What the fuck?
- Oh!

Did you hear that, that ping?

- Were these kids at Luke's?
- Give me that bag.
- That's... a coincidence.
- Gimme that bag.

Gimme your bag.

- Stop, stop!
- What is this?
All right, was is this, some kind of bling-ring shit?
It's that what you guys are doing here, huh?
Taking phones and sell them on the black market?
Is that what you're doing?

Yep, I've seen this on dateline.
- So what?

- I catfish rich dudes.

- I'm a YouTube unboxer.

- Okay, all right, i steal things.
Sorry, I can't help myself.
Please don't turn me in.
- So we're not gonna call the cops, 'cause we're cool as shit, but you're all gonna pay the price for Zoe's shenanigans tonight.
You'll survive, Jamie.
Now... you're all gonna be technology-free for the next hour.
Let's cut this electronica bullshit and get some peabo Bryson up in here.
- Five minutes.
Yeah, right.
- Okay.

You ready for that?

All right, you're gonna face each other, in the flesh, without a phone, to filter out any of those oily little teenage pores you got.
- Whoo!
You're welcome.
- I've got one.
Never have I ever walked in on my parents doing it.
- Dude.

- Okay, ready?
Never have I ever had lice.
- What?

- Ew!

- No!

- I'm so never having kids.

- This is fun.
- I think we freaked them out.
- Good.

- Never have I ever cheated on my husband with an old boyfriend from high school.
- How did I not know?

- Yeah.

It's because I only post the pretty stuff.
- You're the pretty stuff.
- Never have I ever...

While I was married.
- Emily.

- I stopped it immediately.

It was a mista...

I am...

- Are you sure?
I'm terrified, but I think...
I realized tonight that I want my marriage to work.
I want it to work with tom.
- You just have to fight for it, sweetie pie.

- All right.
Never have I ever dressed up my husband's dick as Napoleon.
- Whoa, wait a minute.

- Okay, you guys, remember, like, when we went on that Alaskan cruise last year?
- Yeah.

We went to this sex retreat, to reconnect.
- Really?

- Yes, it worked.

- Yeah.

It was really very good, critically acclaimed.
- Whoa.
- Anyway, yeah.
And we still do it, and I love it.
- That's a really good one.

- All right, never have I ever had real mom friends.
- Come here, give me a hug.
Come on, give me a hug.

- I want in.

You guys are still wet.
Aren't you freezing?

- A little bit.
- Oh, I'm so glad Emily and i didn't have to go in the water.
- Hmm.
- Ow!

I'm getting a goddamn epidural first.
- The CIA should use this shit on terrorists.
- Oh, god, you guys are all a bunch of wimps.
- It's very delicate tissue down there, Jamie.
You know, I'm already regretting my choice.
Should I have gone with the mt.

Peter loves history.

He's gonna love that.

- Hey, em.
Turn around.
- What?

Turn around.
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
- You did this.

It's all tom.

- Go get your Jake Ryan.
Go!

- Whoo!
- Tom looks kind of hot.
I guess the talk worked.
He's even got the sweater, you guys.
- Uh-oh.

- But she looks okay.
What happened?
- Well, tom said he didn't want me to miss our dinner, so I'm gonna meet up with him later.
- Shit.
- The Porsche is ours for the night.
- Really?

Nice work, tom!

- Are you sure?

- You got that right, bitches.

- Let's go.
