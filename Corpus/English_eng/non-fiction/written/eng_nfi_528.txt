My name is Shin Michima.
I am a novelist.
In the novels that I write, nobody dies.
It's because my father is a murderer.
Six months ago, I started living under the same roof with five women who received invitations to come here from an unknown source.
These ladies pay me one million yen a month in rent.
I take care of them.
Just as I was starting to get used to this odd lifestyle, one of the ladies, Nanaka Hiraki, was murdered by someone.
The number of mysterious women was reduced to four, and our odd lifestyle instantly became extraordinary again.
Yesterday afternoon, at an apartment in Kita Ward, middle-aged male and female were stabbed dozens of times, and ending up being killed.
The police officer who came to the scene was also stabbed and killed.
FIVE YEARS AGO
The suspected murderer is the dead woman's husband.
The police are investigating the motive for the murders.

MURDER IS
UNFORGIVABLE!
MURDER IS UNFORGIVABLE!

Do you have any idea why Nanaka Hiraki was killed?
EPISODE 8 REASON
Do I have any idea why?
I have a lot.
Such as?
She was a hugely successful actress.
There must have been tons of people who hated her.
Does that include the women who lived with her?
Of course not!
I just can't believe
Nanaka has been murdered.
Then, tell me what Nanaka Hiraki did while she was in her home.
I don't really know.
I hardly had any contact with her.
Then, can you imagine who might have killed her?
It wasn't me.
I mean, who would do such a thing?
How did a murderer get inside?
Did you know Nanaka Hiraki before she lived with you?
Not really.
Then, would you please tell us everything you know about Nanaka Hiraki?
Even though we lived together,
I didn't know anything at all about Nanaka Hiraki.
The police told me about Nanaka's life.

I heard that after her mother's death, she had no other relatives.
Come in.
Excuse me.
Okay.
Mr. Michima.
Yes?
You'll be going home soon.
The murderer has turned himself in.
What?
The man who murdered the internationally famous Nanaka Hiraki was a crazy fan.
Oh, dear.
The man arrested on suspicion of murder...
She's dead.
Do you know why
Nanaka Hiraki was killed, Mr. Moriguchi?
She was resented by a fan, right?
That's what she gets for associating with Shin Michima.
She sure was very stupid.
She had talent, but she lacked the skill to use it.
She must not have had enough self-love.
I see.
I can understand that.
Do you think this can be used to promote World Theory ?
I was thinking the same thing.
It was me who she spent her last evening with.
I have a feeling we can use that.
It looks like she read your novel, Mr. Michima.
DRIFTING EMOTIONS BY SHIN MICHIMA
Why was she killed?
Was it really done by the crazy fan?
I'll get that fucker.
I'm afraid.
What did you tell them, Novel?
What did you tell them about us living here?
I told them the truth.
But,
I couldn't answer any of their questions.
DRIFTING EMOTIONS BY SHIN MICHIMA
"The true atonement..."
THE TRUE ATONEMENT BEGINS NOW.
Throw these things away.
It was sent by the guy who killed Nanaka.
I asked the police about that.
They said he didn't send any fax.
Then who did?
I don't know.
It's different than all the rest that have come until now.
Today, the funeral for Nanaka Hiraki was held.
Over 4,000 fans, actors and other film industry people gathered to mourn her untimely passing.
I had always hoped
to work with her someday.
THE CURSED HOUSE!

THE CURSED HOUSE!
The currently popular novel, Drifting Emotions, authored by the novelist, Shin Michima, who Nanaka lived with, is predicted to sell over one million copies.
It has received the Japan Outstanding Literature Prize, after all.
If he keeps making this much news, he'll win Japan's Hottest Topic Award, even though he has no talent.
But...
Oh, excuse me.
He's selling very well.

THANK YOU, NANAKA!
MICHIMA
Hey!

It's your fault Nanaka was killed.
We'll never forgive you for what you did.
Hey!

How dare you run away!
Hey!

Are you always looking for roles that you can play?
DRIFTING EMOTIONS BY SHIN MICHIMA
When I was a child, I loved acting so much.
I accepted as many roles as I could possibly play.
But, it has only been recently that I've actively sought out roles that I really want to play.
No, not especially.
So...
I'm sorry.
To be completely honest,
I'm still having trouble talking about Nanaka Hiraki.
Mr. Hanaki, will it be all right for you to continue?
I'm sorry, Ms. Miura.
I guess I'm not professional enough.
As for the theme of my work,
I believe that ultimately, not a single person exists who hates their own self.
You know the word "self-denial," right?
I despise that concept.
I won't lie to you.
From the very bottom of my heart, I love the person that I am.
I see.
May I add one more thing?
Sure.

On the night of her death,
I spent time with Nanaka Hiraki.
I will never forget talking with her... about my book World Theory .
As part of my heartfelt condolences,
I will carry out her intentions.
Here he comes!
Excuse me, Mr. Michima.
Give us your thoughts on Nanaka Hiraki.
What do you think about her death?
People believe her murder was caused by jealousy.
Do you think you're responsible?
What were you doing on the day of her death?
-Excuse me.

-What was your relationship with her?

-Let me through.

-Give us a statement, please.

Excuse me!

-Answer our questions!

-What do you want to say to the murderer?

Everyone!
You're all quite dedicated, aren't you?
But give him a break, will you?
Mr. Sakurai, thank you for coming all the way here today.
Not at all.
I owe a lot to Ms. Hiraki.
Also, there's something I want to tell you.
Really?
Actually, a major movie company was impressed by the sales of your book, and has offered to make Drifting Emotions into a movie.
If we make this deal, even more people will read your novels.
I really appreciate that offer, but...
I'd like to turn it down.
What?
May I ask why?
The actress who should play the lead role... is gone.
Sunako.
Have you found out who's behind this?
Yes, I've confirmed your suspicions.
I see.
How is it being famous?
You wanted to be successful, right?
This is not what I wanted.
This is not how I wanted things to happen.
Are you serious?
Yes.
I see.

You are a terrible liar, Michi.
But I guess that's fine.
You're great at lying to yourself though.
Make sure you tell people the things you want them to hear.
Once you're dead, you can't say what you want anymore.
Nanaka.
Goodbye.
What?
Inside.
Shin.
Sorry for the trouble I've caused.
I mean about your novel and stuff.
Dad.
Yes?
There's something I've been wanting to ask you.
Yes?
Why...
Why did you kill them?
It was for me.
At least, in my case it was.
For yourself?
Couldn't you consider the feelings of the people you killed?
At that time the hatred I had for your backstabbing mother and Mamoru Doi wiped out everything else from my mind.
Dad.
You're a scumbag.
You're right.
Your father is a scumbag.
There is no good reason for killing a person.
I read this.
DRIFTING EMOTIONS BY SHIN MICHIMA
Thank you.
It's selling really well, isn't it?
Yes.
That's great.
I guess you've moved on with your life.
Mrs. Mizuguchi.
Yes?
Why do you send those nasty faxes?
Because it's just not fair.
He goes and kills people because he wants to.
Then he gets to be killed himself.
The dead person ends up with nothing.
To the living, all that's left
are regrets and remorse.
Nothing will ever happen again in my son's life.
But the murderer's son is a successful author, and it's thanks to him.
How convenient for you!
I'm sorry.
So, do you know why I sent those faxes?
In a way.
"In a way."
I see.
You've always felt it, haven't you?
You felt my hatred.
But, don't worry.
I won't send anymore faxes.

So, don't come here anymore.
I can hardly believe that Nanaka is not here.
I don't want to believe it.
In the morning,
I think I'll see her get up, yawning that huge yawn of hers.
And she would say, "Michi, good morning!"
What?
Did I say something funny?
It's just that you said Michi with such a straight face.
You're the person I would least expect to say Michi.
Right.
What's the matter, Minami?
I had the murderer investigated.
I have a friend who has connections with the police.
Did you find out something suspicious?
The man who killed Nanaka was not her fan.
He didn't know her age, and had not even seen any of her movies.
What?

The murderer was in debt for over 30 million yen.
After the murder, it was paid off.
Did he do it for money?
That's right.
Nanaka was killed for money.
Who wanted Nanaka killed?
The person who brought us to this house.
The real murderer is whoever sent us the invitations.
But why would he do that?
I still don't know that.
But I don't think the real murderer has achieved his objective.
I won't stand for what he's doing.
Do you think you know who sent the invitations?
Who the hell do you think I am?
I've known for a long time.
Really?
Who is it?

It's better that you don't know.
Leave this to me.
It's still vague, but his real goal is becoming clear.
His goal?
There's someone who benefits from Nanaka's death.
Benefiting from someone's death?

It really pisses me off to think she would be killed for that.
Who in the world...
There is someone... who has benefited a lot from it.
Don't say it, Shin.
I don't like thinking about that.
DRIFTING EMOTIONS BY SHIN MICHIMA
It's... me.
After Nanaka's death, my novel has
sold over one million copies.
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL.

Nobody else is going to die, right?
The promotional effects of Nanaka Hiraki were fantastic.
Drifting Emotions has garnered incredible attention.
So, Novel, do you remember kissing me before?
