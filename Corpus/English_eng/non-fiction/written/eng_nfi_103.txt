Previously on "Bates Motel"...
It's like there's a cord between our hearts.
We belong to each other,
And I don't ever want to live in a world without you.
We pulled two bodies
Out of falls lake a couple days ago.
We're charging you additionally with the murders of jim blackwell and audrey ellis.
Norman is nice...
Okay, he's kind, he's a good person...
Maybe multiple personalities or something,
But he... he changes.
I'm coming for you when you least expect it.
Hello, Norman.
And get in the back.
What do you want with us, Alex?
You're gonna take me to her body.
How much further?
There's a turn,
Then there's a little more of a drive,
And then there's a little walk.
But we are getting close, Alex.
No.
Alex.
See what you've done now on your little quest for stupid vengeance?
She's innocent.
Alex, what happened to you?
I don't understand any of this.
This isn't about you, Regina.
But you've lost your mind.
Jesus, I haven't lost my mind!
That's debatable.
Regina.
Regina, dear, slow down.
I think that the turn is coming up.
Here?
Turn there please, Regina.
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car!
Please, don't.
Follow the road.
It... it's gonna take you back to the main highway.
But someone'll find you in a few hours.
I might die of hypothermia.
Walk fast.
This isn't who you are, Alex.
Go before I change my mind!
Okay, how much farther up the road?
Maybe...
I'm lying.
You better pray you're not lying.
I'm not lying.
*BATES MOTEL* Season 05 Episode 10 "The Cord"
All right, get this out wide.
30-mile radius, and call in the u.S. Marshal service.
I want everyone on this.
And get somebody to check the residences.
Bates and Romero.
All right.
Come on in.
What's going on?
Your brother Norman was kidnapped
From the police station
By Alex Romero.
How the hell did you let that happen?
He also took our office manager, Regina,
Took her hostage,
So this isn't just about Norman.
Sit down.
Do you have any idea where Romero could take Norman?
You want my honest opinion?
He took him somewhere to kill him.
Okay, now, I-i don't know if that's... if that's the woods
This is in... this is insane.
Norman is sick, okay?
He needs psychiatric help.
Did you forget your brother has been charged with multiple murders?
What, so... so that means, you know,
You don't care if something happens to him?
The person I care about the most is Reginaworth, and I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get her back safe.
You better not let anything happen to him.
Right here.
I think we should...
Norman?
It's not for you to be here.
Look, I don't know what's going on,
But you do not want to mess with me right now, Norman.
Would it shock you to know that I'm not Norman?
That he isn't here and that you can't touch him?
Oh, you're above it all, are you?
And why should I tell you where she is if you're only gonna kill me anyway?
Did you think about that, Sheriff lonely heart?
Listen to me, you piece of shit.
I-I don't know what kind of sick fuck
Digs his mother's body out of a grave and moves it around, okay, and I don't want to know about it or what you did to it.
All I can tell you is, I can shoot you once I find her, and I can make it quick and clean,
Or I can make you suffer for days,
And believe me, I got ideas.
Now you tell me how you want to do this.
All right.
Get out.
Get up.
Why are you stopping?
We're here.
Show me.
It will go faster if you help me.
I'm so sorry.
For everything that happened.
I know how much you loved her.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
I'll always love you.
You killed your own mother.
You can't hide from it.
Mother.
I think I did kill her.
She was everything I had.
I mean, it was supposed to be the both of us.
I have to leave now.
You can't leave me now.
You know everything now,
And there's nothing for me to protect you from.
Good-bye, Norman.
How'd you sleep?
Mother, you're here.
I just had the most horrible dream.
What happened in it?
I don't...
I don't even want to think about it,
It's so horrible.
I dreamed you died.
Well, I didn't.
I'm right here.
Life is in front of us.
Where are you going?
Mother?
Mother!
Mother.
You're really here.
Oh.
You just had a bad dream, honey.
You need to learn how to wake up from 'em.
You... you can if you just try hard enough.
Mother.
It won't stop.
Mm...
Am I still dreaming?
Mother?
Mother.
What?
I have some exciting news.
Tell me.
We're moving to oregon.
What... what are you talking about?
I bought a place with the insurance money,
And I bought a new car.
Well, it's a new used car, but it's a mercedes,
And we're gonna be really, really happy.
What place?
Mother, how could you do this and not tell me?
Because it's a surprise, and I know you'll love it.
We got packing to do.
Okay, mother.
I'm coming.
Okay, this is the part where you say,
"Mother, this is so beautiful.
"I'm so happy we're moving here.
You are so smart to have thought of this."
Mother, this is so beautiful.
I am so happy you're making me move here.
You are so smart to force me to do things I have no say in.
You're an ass.
Open your eyes.
What do you think?
This is crazy, mom.
It's not crazy.
We're gonna run this place.
We own a motel, Norman Bates.
Bought the whole thing, the house and the Motel,
Had a foreclosure, and everything came with it.
The space is beautiful.
It's all gonna be good.
You'll see.
Okay, mother.
I'll believe you.
Hey, hey, hey!
Well, look what the cat dragged back into town.
Hey, Remo.
Oh, my pleasure.
Hey, I heard about what's happening with your brother.
I'm sorry about that, man.
So is that a wedding ring?
Yeah.
Yeah, I got married.
Yeah, I met a chick.
She's a sister of one of our trimmers.
Dude, everything's changed around here.
You wouldn't believe it.
I'm working for this licensed grower now.
We grow 22 strains of Artisanal Cannabis.
We deliver to 31 dispensaries all over the place.
That's great, man.
And your daughter and Emma.
That's awesome.
It's great.
Well.
Have a peek at that.
Here.
What do I, uh...
I got a ton of those things laying around.
No use for 'em anymore.
All right, you... you sure?
You're gonna offend me
If you don't put that wallet away.
Thanks.
Just, uh, tell me that's for protecting
Your wife and your daughter.
Yeah.
And me.
And you?
You all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Yeah?
Nah, I'm good.
All right, cool.
Well, I got to split,
But, uh, next time,
Give me a little more notice.
We can make a real plan.
Reminisce about our outlaw days.
All right.
Sheriff Greene!
You get some rest.
I'm gonna go down and check out the office.
We can get it all set up tomorrow.
I want this place to be a success for us.
Close the door.
Someone close the door.
Hey, can I help you?
We need a room for the night.
They've had it with the car for today.
Wow, what happened to you?
There... there are a lot of steps.
We can accommodate you.
I'll just need your name and address
Our system just isn't up yet.
Harry, Dylan, stop touching everything.
Sorry.
His name's Dylan?
Hmm.
I have a brother named Dylan.
Yeah?
We named him after Dylan Thomas.
The poet.
Uh, that's... that's nice.
No other guests, so Harry and Dylan can make as much noise as they like.
Ugh, thanks, but is it okay if they play outside for a bit?
I mean, it's safe here, right?
It's nothing if not safe.
Thank you.
Leave it, leave it, leave it.
Got it?
Okay.
You guys need to get some energy out.
Hey, everybody's getting in.

That is completely beyond my control.
I'm so sorry.
I don't mean to be a dick.
I've just had a really bad day.
Okay.
Hello?
Dylan, it's me.
It's Norman.
Of course I'm okay, Dylan.
And I know mother does too.
Wait... "Mother"?
I know that she can be so stubborn sometimes.
I... it's just because she gets hurt so easily, and I-I know that the two of you had that... terrible fight before we moved from Scottsdale,
But I just...
I think this could be a new beginning,
Dylan, for all of us.
and we're not a family without you, Dylan, and...
So I just really think we should start over and, uh,
And be together and... and that I guess the real reason that I'm calling is,
I would love it if you could come over for dinner.
You will?
Oh.
Yeah?
Are you with Romero?
Romero?
No, I-I don't know a Romero.
Okay.
All right, well, um, you just... just hang tight, okay?
All right.
Tha... thanks, Dylan.
I'll see you, uh, see you soon.

Norman's been missing from jail for a day.
Romero kidnapped him.
Emma, he...
Norman called me.
Does the Sheriff know?
No.
Dylan, you have to tell her.
She doesn't give a shit about Norman.
If I tell her, then they're gonna rush in there, and he's gonna end up dead.
Well, I don't care.
I don't care about Norman.
I care about you.
Dylan, you have a child.
I know I have a child.
Do I have a wife?
Please don't do this.
Norman's dangerous.
He's not dangerous to me.
You sound like Norma.
Tell me you love me, Emma.
So you can go and do something stupid.
I'll never love anyone else but you.
You screwed me there, Emma decody.
Yes?
Uh, did my brother Norman check you in here?
He's, uh, in his early 20s, dark brown hair, and really polite.
Yeah, why?
You, um...
You need to leave.
What are you talking about?
My br... my brother has some mental issues, and he shouldn't be checking people in the motel.
He made a mistake checking you in.
Oh.
