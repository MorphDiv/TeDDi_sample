Tell me a little about yourself.
I do not know what to say.
I am 43 and divorced.
I have a son, but it bother you not hear about.
Yes I would like to.
Sorry, but this is the first time I do something here.
It is okay.

You have a nice voice.
It's sexy.
- Do you think so?

You're easy to talk to.
- You're probably good at your job.

- Now you tell us a little.

I do not know...
What are you wearing?
- Kevlar.

The shooter is in position.

- Haas, let me persuade him.

Are you insane?

Five minutes.
Team one, give me a report.
- Are you there?

I thought that maybe we can meet face to face.
On a date?
Yes.
It is a lie...
This should not happen.

I just wanted my damn tax refund!
Dan, I beg you.
Hold on a little longer.
I do not care what happens to me.
My son deserves something better than this.
Team one, be ready to shoot.
Agent Blair!
Hell!
Dan, tell me where we're going on a date.
What?
I know an Italian place.
It is a small place called Fellini's, I think.
- Do they have good food?

It's where I proposed to my bitch an ex-wife.
So maybe we should go somewhere else.
I know not how you look.

Believe me, it will be difficult  to overlook me.
Whose side are you on, Blair?
Would you take a bullet for one of your disturbed admirers?
If you want to follow your sick female instinct, so here you go.
So do us both a favor.
But no one should die because you can not follow orders!
Agent Blair, I swear by my life that you're done.
You must be out of my unit, my city and my time zone.
They find you never during all the paperwork, I bury you under.
Your telefonsexdage is over.

Good evening.

- Welcome on board.

Good evening, sir.

Pardon.
Excuse me.
Is this your place?
- Unfortunately not.

I hope not.
After all, I'm already tired of snobs in the first class.
My name is Claire.

- Is this your first trip per night for D.C.?

You stay here while Rick reviewing safety procedures   and then immediately begin to serve food and drink.
Well then.

Excuse me, but it has been my place.
I actually have the window seat.
- I already strapped me down.

- Not to be difficult, but...

You're sitting in my seat.
It does not matter.

Listen, asshole.

Move or I skinning the cat sweatshirt you and stop it up...
- Is everything all right here?

I am terribly sorry.

Sorry, but it's been a long day, and I will not be a nuisance.
I would just sit in my seat, which he has taken   and close your eyes and sleep for five hours.
Can we offer something to drink or a little snack?
- I want a free meal.

Will you come with me?
- And an extension to the safety belt.

Sorry again.
I am terribly sorry.
I usually deal with people better.

You sit probably better here.
- Do you mean it?

- I thought you were going to throw me off.

- Thank you.

By the way, I've always dreamed of doing what you just did.
- Thank you very much.

This is your captain.
It takes a few minutes before we roll out from the gate.
So do you it convenient, we are soon in the air.
The weather is clear and the flight time is calculated to five and a half hours.
Welcome on board.
- Is this your first time?

At the first class.
- Do I look so forlorn?

If you get this one here?
You seem to belong here.
Terry.

Blair.

- Can I buy you a drink?

- Excuse me, may I ask...

A washcloth?
Sir.?
- What are you fleeing from?

No?

Not to be rude, but I'm not so good at small talk right now.
- It is okay.

I fucked up   and have to sit behind a desk in D.C. rest of life.

- Do not leave.

Forget D.C. and take with me to Paris instead.
You were not kidding with dropping the huddle.
Why not?
Because it's crazy.
It's no worse than doing something that makes you unhappy.
The first class has to afford it, but I have to stick to the rules.
People follow the rules, because they are afraid to make decisions.
I work for the police, and they go very much up in the rules.
- Can I help you?

Hello and welcome aboard at Speedbird Airlines!
May I have your attention?

- Let me hear you, first class.

Gab not!
- Do you like it?

The airline, which is your home in the air.
In flies with Speedbird We hope you enjoy the journey.
Up to the table!
Welcome to Speedbird, the only thing you need to know.
Hostage Dealer.

- No?

Fuck...

Then you may encounter some obnoxious people.
Yes, constantly.
Answer honestly now.

- If the page?

No, never.
In talking together and create a relationship.

The poor sitting locked up in a bank with the whole world against them.
While they threaten innocent with a gun.
- That you have the right.

But sometimes, deep inside  you hope that they will make it.

Anything with potatoes...
So easy was not to be.
Nothing.
Maybe we should take...
- Excuse me a moment.

Sir...
They should go back to your place.
I can not decide.

Should I take it or karamelbuddingen?
- Are you okay?

Speedbird 709 increases 1000-6000.
We need to land as she sits astride me and takes his coat.
- You are joking.

He said: "Shall I take over?"
So I ask:

Speedbird 709, we can see you on the radar.

Do you have a have a drink more?

Want more?

Not to fly, but more to lose control.
- Should I call the flyværtinden?

It will be fine, thank you.
Do not worry.

- As a flying tank.

FBI uses it when we practice rescue operations.
We practice everything.

- Are you well paid?

Around 70,000?
The boundary between being eccentric and rude is subtler.
Would you like to be 50 million richer when we leave the plane here?
I have plugs in your ears.

I offer you 50 million just on the spot   if you agree to help me.
That's what I thought you said.
What do you need my help?
To make me live the plane.
Remain open, please.
What I am trying to say is that the plane here, soon to be hijacked.
They are not interested in terrorism or politics.

- Who is it?

Flyværtinde.

She is not a real flyværtinde.
She is...
Who is she?
My ex.
- Would you like something to drink?

Maybe a little water or coffee?
No, it's okay, thanks.
It's a long flight, and it takes a long time before I come back.
Okay, so I take a ginger ale.
Here you go.
Thanks.
We have not much time.

Are you with that I can sign up to be a threat?
I have not threatened anyone.

If you do not stop, I download attendants.
Listen carefully.
I know them and know how they act.

Why do you even bother?
- It's about what I have to.

When I am back, I will pretend we never had this conversation.
- Gretchen...

You'll have to trust me.
Generate master you?
No, he has just gotten a little too much to drink.

Champagne.
What are we celebrating?
Hello?
Are you okay?
- Have you missed me?

What a beautiful hairstyle.
- I told you it was great.

- It was not very nice?

The coffee machine?

- That's how I remember it.

Unfortunately, the aircraft not in the air long enough for you when you find it.
Terry?
The plane is ours now.
- Nothing.

Look here.

- Canali, Savile Row.

Your taste is the problem itself, Terry.

How do you think we found you?
Lesson no. 1:
If you want to cheat someone, make sure that they do not survive.
It is you the expert.
Realize that you were greedy.

Congratulations, you got me.

I have run out of a row.
This is not a getaway car.
Should I get the plane to change course, the Air Force just shoot us down.
I agree with you, but first they must find us.
What should I do with it?
- Hey sweety.

- What do you want?

I'll take a soda.
- You have not worked here before.

I believe it.
- Do you tell it?

It is difficult when there is a billion at stake.
I let you keep your legs Sharpe.

Now I have to listen to your advice and kill you.
What do you imagine, Terry?
But I must admit that you are a skilled thief.
Unfortunately, you do not know how to hold on to things.
The price is like for my children's schooling stay, but you can get a glass of water?
Is there anybody?
Frankly?

It does not end like this.
- Save it for dullen first class.

I attack might this from the wrong angle.
- I do not even know who she is.

Pardon?

Pardon?
Oh God!
You again.
- You never told what your name was.

- My name is Luke Byres.

How do you know that?
Be careful how you carry your weapon.

Never mind.

I think that the plane has been hijacked.
Luke?
The plane has been hijacked.
- Have they threatened you?

There is a death flight out back.
- Is this your first crisis?

I should have secured the cabin and cockpit.
Wait, do not drink it there.
There can be hijackers between staff.
What nonsense!
Stop complaining you.
He said nothing about the girl uniforms.
As if that makes any difference.

709 here.

- Requesting to go down to 8,500 m.

Go down to 8,500 and stay there.
We need to provide the master message and divert the aircraft.
I will come along.
I thought Sharpe could fly.
He knows what he's doing.
And what is it?
He makes sure that passengers collaborations.
Here is your captain.
We experienced a drop in cabin pressure.

Stay seated and keep oxygen masks on   then comes the staff around and look for you.
They do not belong staff.
Will someone tell what the hell is going on?
Remain in your seat.
- What are you doing?

It's my bag!
Sit down before I run my fist up your ass!

- What's he looking for?

- Nothing happens, the captain said.

- They may have explosives on board.

- I'm sure the cockpit.

Listen carefully.
There is nothing on the plane as they want, and we must find it before them.
The guy who sat next to me offered me a large sum to help themselves.
We'll have to find him first.
Can you fix the steward?
- Yes, I can.

It was fucking...
Stay calm and stay seated.

Air Marshal!
- Terry?

We'll have to hurry.
- Now I have you.

- I assume it was a tough break.

Hullo!
Sharpe?
- What is going on?

- Okay, I'm coming out.

Stay there and lock the door.

Where is he?
- I'll talk to the captain.

- He must have slipped past.

- Sit down, everyone!

- He must be here somewhere.

So find him though!
I had one job, fools.
- Take the stitches now!

Remove the mask now.
Let's go.
- Hello!

Leave her alone!
Can you see the light on?

Agent Blair.
You should have a kick in the ass.
I knew I could trust you.

Was the agreement is not that you had to save me?
We have no deal.
If you need a little time alone, you should have just asked.
What is the plan?
My security is involved, so my arms are checked in.
So we have to find my bag.
Give me your hands.
All passengers must be checked.
Up with your hands.
Show me your hands.
- Where is the man who sat here?

Where is he?
Where is the man who sat here?

Where the hell is he?
Have you broken arms?
- Oh yeah.

- What kind of bag is it?

- You lack certainly not money.

Matthew?
- So what?

No trace?
Hell, Sadie!

Is that how you talk to me now?
No sorry.
Well.

Check under the seats and in the toilet.
Led anywhere on the plane.

What the hell is this?
Move!
- Fuck!

- What happened to you?

- They were right here.

- Do I have a mark here?

- Damn!

- I'm just having a break.

Here.
How do you think it is to fly first class?
Fantastic.

Who are you?
- Pardon?

How do you know these people from?

- I was their partner.

With what?
As freelancers, if you have to put it nicely.
- So you're all criminals.

This is not a joke.
- I arrest you when we land.

Should I mention all the illegal acts you have committed on board?
It is not me who is the villain here.
Think that you believe in that stuff.
But to be honest, you have not told me anything.
- It was the perfect plan.

It was a damn good plan.
I was the one who created the trust.

I could figure out where the money was less than five minutes.
Sharpe...
He looks like a bully, but his brain is razor sharp.
All machines that have ever been built   he can disassemble and reassemble with his bare hands.
But he lays hands on people, the result is quite different.
And as for my  ex  Sadie is the one who has balls.
Balls?

Go down there, Lennox.
I want him alive.
- And the woman?

Down!
- Stop, it hurts!

Is there anyone at home?
- You'll have to quit.

To finish my sentences.

They saw us not shown.
Thank God.
I just spotted my suitcase.
- Can you reach to it?

Just keep looking.
Let me know if they come.
I have it.
Damn...
- What?

Wait a minute.
Come on.
Now I have you!
I am not so easy to impress, but it was damn cool.
Gretchen?
- What are you doing?

- What?

- It is here.

The last place anyone would look.
WARNING!

What is it taking so long?
Stand still.
Start walking.
- What had you imagined?

The advantage with the biological material,   is that you do not investigate it, because it can cause...
- Tissue damage.

Ask him open.
- You can still pull you out.

- How much is he paying you?

You have no idea how long I've prepared this coup.
What I had to get through  and how much dirt I got on my hands.
What's this about?
- How much is it worth?

Joe's...
So you snowed your companions?

You really do not have high thoughts about me.
Those up there, my companions...
It was those who stuck me in my back.

What are you doing?
Do you want to carry around a bucket shit?
Open the door or I shoot!
Matthew?
You know what to do.
- Are you okay?

But I can not get free.
- Are you hurt?

Terry?
- He'll be back.

You are safe here.
Do not.
Terry?
Terry!
Byres.
The aircraft is secured.

I knew you were a good investment.
I'm sorry, Terry.

- Where is your little companion?

It does not matter.

709, you are on 4500 m and wane yet.
In the case of an emergency?
- I redirect you now.

- Is that...?

It is here you will definitely like to see.
It was almost as good as bad sex.
It is okay.
Thank you, my God.

This is your captain.
I regret the hard landing.

I hope everyone is okay.

Let them do their work, we are soon on the wings again.
We facilitate on six minutes.

I'll fix it in five.
Sit down and keep your mouth shut!
Do not give me a reason to kill you!
It would have worked, Sharpe.
What did you say, Terry?
We could be let go.

"Even the best plan can go skewed.

It was the perfect plan.
"And yet we are sitting here.

There is no resort.
Those we stole the bag from can never go to the police.
It does not exist.

It can not be hidden.

They are not going to lead at all.
We all want to be dead.
Full speed!

When they search the wreckage, they find all occupants.
Even Sadie and me.
The black box.

- They find out what has happened.

It is the beauty of it here.
The aircraft will be my chief witness.
The mechanics are in the process of installing a dummy   that will tell something else.
Officially got off the plane just problems with the hydraulics.
In with it.
- How long time?

Speed.

Your share is located at the door.

Let's get out of here.
- Close the door!

I must give you, Sharpe...
I thought I was the cleverest criminal.
But you really  the wildest supervillain.
Do not try to flatter me.
- Are they finished?

Come on!

You are really good people.
Come on.

- Press start!

Come on.

She helps you.
Stand up in a row.
You must help me to get people off the plane.
Keep calm.
Are you kidding me?
Come on!

Give me your hand.

Give me your hand.
Come on!
You first.
Spring!
Come on!
- It ends here, agent.

- Hands up.

Where are you going?

Put the gun.
How much he offered you?

Your asshole...
Luxury Yacht magazine?
Fuck you!
20 million?
More?

- A little more.

Luke, we have sworn to protect people.
You know as well as I do that there is no money in it!
- I do not care about money.

Come on, dammit!
- How long time?

The control tower here.

In the 900 meters.
Speedbird 709, came.
Sadie!
Sorry sweetie.
You do not belong up here.
You do not, bitch!
Terry!
- We'd better get going.

- Do you have a good excuse?

Now we slip away.
Here, take it.
- I have it.

- Yes.

Damn!
You never answered.
On what?
Let me take it there.
- Be careful where you put your hand.

Never responded to what?
Paris.
Do you mean it?

We have enough time.
It takes weeks before they discover that we were not on the plane.
If they do it...
So what do you say?
Let's get down to the first.
