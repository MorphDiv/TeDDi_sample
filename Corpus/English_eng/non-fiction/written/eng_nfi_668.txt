Hey, mister, you a pilot?
Not yet, but I'm getting there.
- Were you in Korea?

Golly gee, you're a hero!
[chuckles] I'm no hero.
But if it wasn't for me...

Gee, thanks, mister!
Oh, my girl's coming out.

- Treat your folks to dinner.

Hard to believe it's been ten years since we lost him in a horrific plane crash.
Lucky bastard.
- Hey, mister.

Then why are you staring at ladies through that window like one?
- That's my wife in there.

How come you're not leaving me the fuck alone?
I'm gonna tell my dad you swore at me.

Then he can solve your murder, you nosey little shit!
Frank, no!

You're right.

- Frank!

[sighs]
Would you please go in and carry out the rest of the stuff I didn't sell?
There's a lot of it.
Okay, sure.

[sighs] Why me?
Is everybody in your family a loser?

[TV announcer] And now back to Colt Luger...

- Hey, Dad, Colt's back on!

Oh, Christ, who keeps turning this up to 64?
- Dad, it's cold.

Kids in Africa would kill to see their breath.
You sold a friend of mine some bad pixie dust, Tinker Bell, that made him think he could fly.
But gravity's an hombre that never loses.
So slap on a bra because you're about to have a bad trip to the San Cortez Regional Correctional Institute for broads!
See that, kids?
That's the kind of man you want to be: self-employed.
Don't ever go back to the department, Colt!
They'll use you up and hang you out to dry on Christmas!
You'll wind up sitting there with your freezing family waiting for the phone to ring!
Don't worry, Dad.

That's right.

There's no reason for us to be worried.

That airline cannot go on without you.
Now enjoy your show.
[shouts] Psychedelic dandelion!

There's a lizard in my brain!

I'm Roger Dunbarton of Mohican Airways, and we are back!

I'm going to bed.
It's only 7:30.
- It's midnight in my mind.

I liked him better when he yelled at us.
[music] [sighs] God.

No.
No!
Not again.

Frank.

Oh, my God, I just had the worst dream.
You were having another kid.
Maureen's the last one, right?

She's the last one.
Oh, thank God.
It was horrible.

What are you doing?
I'm trying to figure out which bill we can pay.
Well, we got about eight inches of free water falling right now.
So, heat it is.
Frank, we'll get through this.

I'm here for you.

Mohican will realize their mistake and take you back.
And if they don't, you'll get a better job somewhere else.
Yeah, sure.
I'm gonna go downstairs.
Oh, Sue, don't do that.

I meant the kitchen, Frank.
[groans]
Get some sleep.

Only if I get hit by a bus.
[laughter on TV]
Swami says the answer is: "Perpetuate."
[man] Perpetuate.
The question: "How do they charge you in a Vietnamese deli?"
[laughter]
Per-pet-u-ate!

Bill.

I don't know, I'm just kind of worried.
Well, I'm worried about you not getting enough sleep.
Go to bed, honey.

[both screaming]
Leave, leave, leave!
[Kevin] I don't know what you think you saw!

Oh, Christ!
Guten Morgen, Frank!

All right, neighbor!
Fucking asshole, rubbing his charmed life in my face.
The rogue elephant will be euthanized this Friday after the last show.
Speaking of youth, last night's snow storm has caused a rash of school closings
- in the Quint City area.

The following schools are closed:
Abraham Lincoln Elementary, John F. Kennedy High School,
Robert F. Kennedy High School, Martin Luther King Middle School,
- Sharon Tate Elementary...

- Come on, come on!

Medgar Evers Center for Creative Non-Violence,
Archduke Franz Ferdinand School of Cosmetology, Huey Long High...
All right!
...Alfred P. Southwick Elementary...
- Score!

- What are you happy about?

You're not going to school?
Aw, I was gonna drink and fall asleep in the bathtub.
- [phone rings]

Oh, that's the call!

Hang on, it might be Bolo.

Your band's shit, get out of the way!
Frank Murphy speaking.
Oh.
Hello.

Ha ha.
[grunts] It's your mom's boss.
- Hi, Vivian.

Well, it's tough.

Fantastic.

Some idiot crashed a school bus off the Ferndale bridge.
[gasps] That's terrible.
I know, just imagine the traffic.
Hey, hey.

Of course, tomorrow you'll have to make up the deliveries you missed today and do your regular route.
Oh.

Well, that's a positive outlook.

- He's my...

Do you have to fucking chew so loud?
Excuse me for having a resonant skull.
Good news!

We've been handed a gift!
A snow day we can spend together as a family.
[groans]
Don't you "agh" me.
We are all gonna have fun together at the sled hill!
- Yeah!

You guys have a good time.
I'm gonna curl up in an afghan and slowly cry myself into a nap.
No, no.

You are going to leave this house and enjoy the day with your family.
I can't.

Frank, I'm your biggest cheerleader, but it's been three weeks and Bob Pogo has not called yet.
- And I doubt he'll call today.

And, if by some miracle he does call, we have an answering machine.
Come on, you've been a ghost around here since Christmas.
Now snap out of it and be a part of this family again.
[sighs]
- Okay, fine, I'll go sledding.

Because your attitude is starting to affect the children.
Just look at Bill.
Come on, come on.

Oh, it's beautiful.
Murphy family fun day starts now!
- Ah, Christ, Bill.

Hey!
Looks like your boy dinged my dangler.
I thought that was my job.
[chuckles]
You sexy thing.
Excuse me.

Sorry about your van.

I can't take bread from my main man who lost his gig.
I remember once I was out of work for a whole winter.
Oh, wait, that was a vacation.

Hey, Frank, you should go to Hawaii, man!
It'll do you wonders.
See a volcano, drink a volcano, be a volcano.
Have fun in Hawaii, Frank!
This isn't my snowmobile!
He's such a kind soul.
He's a drug addict, Sue.
This day sucks knob already.

No fair.

Nobody's leaving!

Our fun is only starting.

[both] Yay!
Last one to the bottom is a rotten...

Ice-ball!

Goddamn it!
If you cross my path today, Murphy,
I will scalp you, shit in the scalp, and slap it back on your head so everybody calls you "shit wig" and...
- Hey!

Yeah!

I'm afraid of your wife, you out-of-work pussyfart!
You see that, Sue?

I can't even intimidate children anymore.
Don't let him bother you, Frank.

We can still have fun.

I'm trying, but I'm sick of all these busybodies looking at me like I have a fatal disease.
"Oh, you poor man, how's the job hunt going?"
"I don't know, lady, how's your saggy tits going?"
It's all in your head.

Come on, cheer up.
Look around you...

I just know this is going to be a great day.
Sue?

Oh, fuck me!

Oh, hi, Frank.
How's the job hunt going, you poor thing?
Any nibbles?
I should've died in Korea.
Go play with Maureen, that's fun!
Sorry about Frank.

That's all right.

How are you?

Greg abandoned you and the kids.
Oh, no, we're back together!
Greg took a Catholic cruise with Father Pat and came back a different man.
We're going at it like newlyweds!
[moaning]
Well, that's a dirty mouth.
Mister, I'm gonna shut you up.
- Oh, yeah.

Dear Lord, give me strength.
[exhales]
Vagina, vagina, vagina!
Hey, baby!

Christ, I hate it here.
Bunch of kids.

Yeah, like you'd know what to do with one, you virgin!
I know more than you!
Are you forgetting about that fox at the lake I boned all last summer?
How come we never met her?
I told you she died of leukemia.
[scoffs] Last time you said it was polio.
Polio is a gateway disease to leukemia, stupid.
Hey, look, Claire's here.
Oh, she's so fine.
Why don't you fuck her, Kevin?
I blew my shot with her.
She was just about to touch it when my stupid brother boner-blocked me.
I'll never get laid.
Hey, you know, I heard about this loose girl that goes to Roberto Clemente High.
She asks you to come to her house for a free haircut.
And then she fucks you.
Well, that's something.

- I don't know.

Oh, fuck it.

- No, you're not.

I will not die a virgin.
Ow!

Goddamn it, Maureen.

I don't want to be ladylike.
Yes, you do.

I'm getting cleaned!
I don't want to be a Honeybee Scout.
I like rockets and computers.
So marry an astronaut.
But for now, go play with those girls down there doing girl stuff.
Dad!
- What're you guys doing?

Cool!
I give up.
Christ, she's got bigger balls than Bill.
Fight for my pleasure!
[crying]
That jerk ruins everything fun.
We have to stand up to him this year.
I just curl into a ball and sing "Hot Cross Buns."
No!

If we both fought him at the same time, there's no way he...
Ow!
That one had a turd in it!
Oh, dear.

Leave us alone, Jimmy!
Oh, one lucky punch and you think you're tough now?
It wasn't lucky.
It's such a blessing to have a husband who's so happy.
He's always singing.
- He loves to color my hair and do my...

I'm really glad you and Greg are happy, but we are not doing well, okay?
Frank's depressed right now.
Maybe he should take a Pray Away cruise.
We can barely afford to put gas in the car right now.
It's just, he's really down in the dumps.
- He's usually so full of life.

I just want my husband back.
[ice cracking]
Maureen!
Maureen!
Them fish look like mama after she takes her arm vitamins.
Maureen, get off the goddamn ice!

You forgot your pussy!
[grunts] [screams] No!

It's okay, buddy, it's okay.
Only your butt got wet, what the fuck is wrong with you?
He almost drowned as a baby, you heartless whore!
I did?

Daddy, Billy kicked me in the eye a little.
Jesus Christ!
[screams]
- Daddy, water!

Sue, start the car, we're going to the hospital!

You're grounded!

Wait for me, Mommy!
All right, my daughter needs a doctor right away!
Listen, take a seat, fill this out and we'll get to you as soon as we can.
Oh, no.

You fill things out.

Yeah, how about she waits like the rest of us?
How about I take the brake off that thing and send you right out into the snow?
My daughter needs a doctor right now!
Daddy, wa-wa.
Oh, for corn sakes.

Yeah, he'll be fine.

Ah!

Relax, you fucking Mary!

I will have you thrown out of here, mister, if you don't get your emotions under control.
My emotions?

Let me tell you something... "Beatrice."
I don't know what country you're from, but I didn't die for five minutes on a Korean battlefield to come home and be disrespected by a woman like you.
You think because I'm unemployed, you can just shove me and my family to the back of the line?
Well, not on my watch!
If you don't get her a doctor right now, before all these other low-life pieces of shit, then I will follow you to whatever home for dried-up old hags you live in, slap the cat food out of your mouth, grab you by your camel hump
and put you through that fucking wall!
Oh, boy.
[music]
- There's our hero.

- What happened?

And then everybody in the waiting room started clapping.
Well, the main thing is you're all right and Maureen's gonna be fine.
Daddy, I'm a pirate!
Oh, for Christ sakes, Maureen, girls can't be pirates!
You're back!
Dad, it's so cool when you scream at other people.
My little girl's eye is more important than some crazy old man's foot.
- He's fine!

Well, he should have spoke up!

You're my squeaky wheel.
And you were magnificent.
Sometimes a man's got to do what a man does.
And a man feeds his family!

- Yeah!

Frank, a restaurant?
Isn't that a little extravagant right now?
Oh, we're fine, Sue.
This might be the adrenaline shot to the heart speaking, but I feel great again!
- Ooh, can we eat there?

Your old man is gonna take you to the fanciest place in town.
And so, you know, I had nothing better to do,
TV was on the fritz, so I figured, yeah, why not?
I might as well get married.
[all laugh]
It's funny when you pretend you hate each other.
Tell us the real story.
- It was such a lovely summer day...

- Thank you.

Grampa Joe walked me down the aisle and I wore my mother's dress, little Cindy was the flower girl, Monsignor Kreger married us.
- Who?

And of course I didn't know then that you three angels were coming.
But I looked at your father
- and I'll never forget...

- Yes, sir?

Three Plantation Dogs, an Uncle Tom Turkey Platter,
White Meat Supreme, Two Clucks Clams...
Okay, you charged us for eight drinks.

- Refills are free.

Well, I wasn't notified.

Oh, we did, sir.

Well, I didn't come here to read, I came here to eat!
Now, take these off of my check, you bunch of chiselers!
Oh, oh, oh.

If you're having a difficult time right now, we have an "indigent can."
It's near the register.
- I'm no charity case.

But between you and me, we throw the extra food in the trash every night, so if you get here before midnight, you won't have to fight the other vagrants for it.
Daddy, do we have to eat garbage?
Nobody's eating garbage, princess!
Now, let me tell you something, lady...
How dare you insinuate my husband can't pay!
- Sue, butt out.

- I can?

Oh.

We're leaving, and we will never drink your overpriced "Runaway Root Beers" again.
But here's a nice tip because you gave us very good service.
Where did that money come from?
- Just be glad I had it.

It's okay.

What the hell are we gonna do?
I know one thing.

It's best that the kids don't know how bad things are right now.
We... are... fucked.
Ooh, it's colder in here than it is outside.
[clears throat]
Okay, Kevin, I'm coming in now!
[Kevin] I'm not doing anything!
[beeps] [robotic voice] One new message.
Frank, it's Bob Pogo.
We used to work together at Mohican...

It's an airline... down at the airport.
Aw, shit, you know who I am!

- Is somebody there?

[Dolores] You don't have to bite my head off.
[Bob] I'm sorry, dear.

- So, Frank...

[Bob] For God's sakes, you're the only woman for me, now hang up the fucking phone!
Listen, your skills are missed around here, Frank.

Oh, my God.
So, how about you come see me at the airport tomorrow?
It'll be great to have you back.
[squeals]
Yes!
