Are you up for hitting the town.

Bottle opener and music.

Do you want to help to do a surprise thing for Sean's birthday?

Everyone hates me.

I lost my scholarship.
I don't think you should give up on your study.
I believe in you.

I'll stay if you fight for your scholarship.
This place is going to be the making of me, Mavis.
How do you work that out?
Oh!

Great.

No.

Oh, I thought you'd shelved the whole communist kitchenware thing.
No way, May-bowl.

Just like the British opium lords before me,
I'm intending to use this island as my own personal trading post.
Whoa!
She likes it.

I cannot wait to see Sean's face when he finds out.
I can't wait for you to see Nepal.

I haven't, but I can't wait either.
I mean, you cannot study philosophy without going to Nepal.
So, going there is like his lifelong dream?
Oh, it is.

We should definitely get on a trip to base camp.
We're broke, Dylan.
We haven't even got the money for flights or hostels.
Hostel?

Sean only turns 21 once, you know.
What's this about my birthday?
Oh!

You know, parties and cakes.
Just so you know, I don't like fruit cakes.
OK.

Well, Sean-y, this is one surprise you are going to love.
Do you genuinely not like fruit cake?
No, I just eat the icing off.

You are a fruitcake, that's why.
I'm not a fruitcake, I'm saying I love fruitcakes.
Hmm.

I don't understand, the GPS says we're a mile out to see.
Why are you lying to me?
OK.

I think the hostel's down here.
Whoa!

Holy shit, how cheap is this hostel?
Are you sure this is right, Greg?
It says so.

Find whatever you can that you could use as a weapon.
Like this.

Cut, cut!

Guys!
Extras are not needed until tomorrow.
What?

Aren't you all my extras?

Of course it is.

Thank you.

I was actually invited to be a background artist once.
Yes.
Victim numero cuatro on Plumbo Pissau.
Should we have heard of it?

Banned in 17 countries.
Don't get me wrong.

Happens all the time.
Norway banned the Life of Brian for being way ahead of the curve, and who's laughing now?
Not Norway.
They are weeping into their fjords.
I just need to say something to her, Dyl.
I've sat on this for a week, things have really changed between us.
Yeah.

I know, I know.

I really like her and I think she likes me, too.
What makes you think that?
Well, first she keeps telling me not to go home, and now she keeps going on about some birthday surprise.
Yeah.

Like what?
Well, maybe she really is going to buy you a cake.
You see, now it's saying that we're in Burma.
But I think this is us.
We shouldn't have spent money on rickshaws.
What's that smell?
Seriously, what is that smell?
What is that?

It's getting worse.
Wow!

OK.
We can do this.
Oh, shotgun!
Dyl.

Sorry, mate.
This is merely the rags before the riches.
Arggh!
You sure you want to slum it with us?
Might not be the best thing for older bones.
Hey, we're family, aren't we?
Solidarity, sister.

So, I've got 48 hours to send an appeal for my scholarship, to, "Help us understand what went wrong."
Ash, that's amazing!

Oh!

Possibly the sources of the pong.
See that?

Yeah.

Maybe they're going to send the Malaysian Gosling home now that they've had a look at the Nutkins.
Obviously, I don't expect to be discovered or anything.
Oh, right.

Brad Pitt, he was an extra before he was famous, and he's not even that good.
All right, everyone.

Right.

Ooh!
Costume, now.

Oh, God.

I'd be careful if I was you, mate.

What?

Oh, you reckon I'm mugging myself?
Why don't we swap?
Let's me probe her for a bit and find out if she actually likes you.
Yeah, yeah.

Cheers, man.

Excuse me.

Why is mine black?
The outbreak starts in Chinatown.
Well, I...
Nice!

Oh!

I'd rather be pregnant than whatever that is.
Hello, hello, hello!
What's all this, then?

Yes, it does.
I always wanted to be a copper when I was a kid.
The Colombo of Stevenage, that's what they would have called me.
Stay where you are, stay where you are!
Jesus!

Right.

You, make up.

My pen?

And zombies eat in there, too.
Not in dining tent.
What?

What the...
You.

I guess Gosling's safe, then.
Torres, number 6.

12?

And 17?

Married couple, numbers 15 and 16.
Oh, decided to swap.
Oh.
Well, you divorced me already.
And I thought we were meant to be.
Look, I don't care whoever knocked you up.
Charming.

Can you manage that?

All right, guys.

Go, go!

Cut!
Whoa!
Nailed it.
You.

OK.

You, take your top off.
Take off what?
My top off?

As in, not on?

Now, take it off.
Hey, if you've got it...
Maybe I should take mine off too.

Put it back on.

Put it back on!

The first position.
Come on, hubby.
May!

I think I've exhausted all of my Chinese, I'm afraid.
May!

But he's speaking in Chinese.
Oh, OK.

No, I'm not.

He says it's today.

What if we're called?

By destiny.

Well, actually my entire life, is absolutely buggered.
Go get him.
Sorry!
Excuse me!
Whoa!
How's it going?

We'd be fighting them back.
This is stupid.
What?

Oh!

It's delicate work, mate.
Can't just blurt it out.
Cut!
Can you please not talk in shot?
Sorry.

Lunch break.

Thank you very much.
That is not a movie trash.

Hey, how come you got lunch already?
Oh, I'm obviously more important and I'm eating for two.
What?

Do you think I should say something?
No, no.

So, let me show you somewhere cool.
Quite moving, isn't it?

Whoa!
Pervert.

Molesting me.
Objectifying Sean.
What are you talking about?
You know, "If you've got it."
A bit inappropriate.

Oh, yeah.

I can't imagine what that must be like.
Do you fancy him?

Don't be a dick, Dylan.

Sean and me are friends, good friends.
Weird.
Our little zombie baby.
Should we start a marching band with our baby?
Sean's a friend, of course I'm not into him.
Hold up, I'm here!

Oh!

Put your hands down!

Why are you calling him?
No, I'm not the police.
Mr Zhou.
Oh, bugger me.
I'm an extra!

Oh, for heaven's sake.
No, that's not real!
That's not a real gun!
It's not a real gun!

Look, it doesn't matter.
No, please!

I'm not a real policeman!

I just want a meeting!

Mmm.

No, I'm good.

Is this what Ash had?

Hey!

Uh, policeman number 25?
Oh!

I'm sorry, I actually don't know.
Oh!

It's leftovers, like some sort of food collage.
We've been crawling around in dumpsters all morning, and it doesn't seem entirely fair.
And I haven't eaten properly in two days.
Why is it my problem?
It's not.

You know, just because we're zombies?
Look.

Yes, May!
Oh, that is so good.

Did you get all this for us?
Er...

Obviously, I'm not going to eat all this by myself.
Hey.

I spoke to her.

Sorry man, I don't know.
She doesn't fancy you.
She thinks a lot of you, no question.

You're in the friend zone, and once you're in, it's...
There's no getting out.

You OK?
Yeah.

No worries, man.
Anyway, this trip was about us broadening our horizons, getting out on the road, Kerouac-style.
Not getting tied down.
The right girl could walk into your life at any time.
See?

Coffee?
Um, can I get a flat white, please?
No.
And in conclusion, please consider reinstating my scholarship.
I feel confident I'll have a much more productive sophomore year.
Mmm.

And your attendance was like 20%, right?

Ooh!
I take it the meeting didn't go well?
No.

The bottle openers are dog shit.
A dog shit product for a dog shit salesman.
Hey, don't give up!

I'm not an opium lord.

I might have to move back in with my mother.
I'm 37!

I've got a bedtime, there!
I mean it's late, it's 11pm, but it's not great.
Right!

We're going to have a boys' night out.
And how are we paying for that?

Oh!

Sean, come on, chop, chop, let's get a move on!
Colombo!

Yes!

Here you go.

You can have first dibs on that.
Amazingly, someone needs it even more than I do.
I know you feel like shit, mate.
Honestly, just give it a day or two and I bet you wouldn't even care if she got with someone else.
I remember the first few days after my heartbreak very well.
The number one bit of advice - whatever you do, do not stalk her.
Yeah, I'm obviously not going to stalk her, Greg.
I'm not Dylan.

OK, fair point.

I would.

The important thing right now is that you cut every tie that bound you together.
So with me and Daisy, that was kitchen utensils.
With you and Ash, there's some hanging out.
You need to get some self-respect going, doesn't he?
He's right, Sean!

Oy!

Oh, no, no!

OK!
Greg, that was some serious acceleration!
Did you see how close I was?

You all right, though.

We've got the handbag, we've got the handbag!
Thank you!
Whoa, I ate so much breakfast.
You.

You, come.

What's that about?

Yeah, right.

Aah!

What are you doing?
Get away from me, you filthy zombies!
What was that?
I was channelling my character's back story.
You see, I think for Mitch, this woman is everything to him.
Without Debbie, his life wouldn't be worth living.
Who the hell is Mitch?
You went full Nicolas Cage, man.
Ray's an idiot.
I thought it was very brave.
You, you!
Straight into costume check.
And you, make up!
OK.

You haven't started it yet, have you?
I've started it.
It's just, all the grovelling and stuff, it's like trying to get blood out of a stone.
Some very tiny drops of very gritty blood.
You want to help?
Uh, no, I think I'd be quite rubbish at that kind of thing.
Yeah, he would be quite rubbish, actually.
Well go on, then, Mr writer, what would you write?
Well, I wouldn't grovel, for one thing.
I'd just tell them how great you are and accentuate the positives.
Well, maybe some of us aren't so hot on self-promotion as you, Mitch.
Oh.

Knock yourself out.
A cop?

It's a proper job, May.
Everyone looks up to the boys in blue.
I think this could be the making of me.
Oh!
The old exploding condom.
Yes.

Could there be a more noble ending?
May, we have a problem.
Wan!

I don't mean to disturb you.

But?

Please.

I don't mean to be a pain but is that even legal?
I mean, can't they kill people?
No-one will die.
I speak for the zombies, and we're going to strike.
They've agreed.

I can make sure you're not water cannoned.
Well, that's not...

No cannon.

Yeah, but...

Grilled red snapper, dim sum, green curry.
Oh wait, banoffee pie.
Can I lose wearing this?
Hey.

It's actually an improvement.
Should you be smoking?
Oh, it's OK in the third trimester.
Why do you let Dylan talk to you like that?
Say you're shit all the time?
I don't.
Right.

Dylan's looking out for me.

Sure, it's a super complicated man thing.
Gotcha.

What's that supposed to mean?
You don't need any help writing that statement.
You're really clever, but you make out like you don't deserve to be there.
You don't know what it's like at college.
It's full of frap boys that think they can treat me like crap, because their dad paid for the science block and my dad drives a cab.
Don't go, then.
I want my degree.

Right.

Yeah, well maybe Dylan was right, I'm obviously rubbish at this.
Feet down, son.
What this?
I told Ash I'd write her appeal for her.
Hmm.

You don't still fancy her as well, do you?
No, no.

That's all.
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
Because you and Ash, copping off all over Everest, would be a very poor choice for Sean, birthday present wise.
There's no danger of that.
Me and Ash are beyond any copping of any kind.
Hmm.

I want you two to kiss.
Is that really necessary?
You know, she's English.
So why don't I say, erm, "Well done, dear."
Just kiss her!
Eh, it's not like we haven't done it before.
Only this time I'm the love of your life.
Right, guys.

Cut!

Moving on.

How come you're out there, May?
Do we all get new stickers?
Well, no, not exactly.
You see, it's about give and take.

I thought you were one of us.
I am.
You just care about yourself, you traitor.
What's different, there?

It's a girl!

Go ahead, tell them your suggestion.
Bronte.

Falling at the first hurdle of parenting.
You two should never have a baby.
Or do anything that might, in theory, lead to one.
Zombies and cops on set.
Tourists to make-up.
Here we go.
Finished your appeal, by the way.
Oh, thanks.
As an open hearted, beguiling and luminous person who attracts and inspires everyone around her, I naturally found that my academic work suffered as my admiring fellow students competed for my time and attention.
It's great.

I'm not sure the tone is quite right for college, but it's cute.
Thank you.

Whoa, Dylan!

Fight what?
Well, this feeling between us.
What?

Dylan, I don't feel anything for you.
I think you do.

This is just what you do.

I don't flip flop.

Yeah, but that's totally different.
I see that now.

This is the real thing, Ash.
This might come as a shock, Dylan, but not everyone loves you as much as you love yourself.
Ash!
Got your guns, right?

All right.

Easy.
That doesn't make sense.
How does suicide match up with my previous heroics?
What?

Now, OK, that wasn't in the actual film but that still speaks to a man's character.
Listen.

It's just a montage.
All right?

All right, let's go for a take.

I think maybe I was wrong before.
About you being over Ash in a few days.
It must be torment for you, seeing her all the time, feeling humiliated.
I wouldn't say I was humiliated.
Best to have a clean break, though, don't you think?
Yeah.

Go do your birthday surprise?
Yeah?

Something you'll enjoy a lot more if you're not dealing with rejection.
Come on!
Let's give you a life-changing 21st.
Sorry, hang on!

I'm so sorry.

It's just not working.

What's the hold-up?

Wow!

You know what?
Forget the suicide shot.

You're still dead in the next scene.
Sure, yep.
As long as I went down fighting.
What's up with the new friends?

Water.
And pao?

OK, let me read it.

Your appeal.

What?

Make sure the pathetic begging really jumps of the page.
Ash, it's not funny.
Yeah, well, I've had some shit going on.
Dylan just made a move on me.
Huh!

I thought you were more into Sean, now.
Why does everyone keep saying that?
Sean's a friend.
Yeah, he's great.
He's sweet, sensitive.
I can see why someone might like him.
But...
I don't sleep with friends.
You do spend a lot of time with him.
We're hardly attached at the hip.
It's always you and Sean doing this, you and Sean doing that.
You can see how that might look.
Do you think that's how it might look to Sean?
Oh, my God!

Sean thinks I like him.

No.

Moving on to the final scene and I need everybody on set.
Hey.

Um, look, Sean.
I think you might have the wrong idea about me.
I've got no ideas about you.

Because it's not like I want to hang out all the time, you know.
It's cool.

Yeah, I mean, me and Dylan are heading off after this.
Oh.

Right, amazing.

Just as long as you're not leaving because of me.
What?

Dylan planned it.

Oh.

Perfect.

Stop!
Stop, stop.
Not this again!
We can't let them do this to us.
Us?

You're not going to be hit.
If that water canon doesn't go off, the zombies do not get paid.
What is the hold-up?

Yeah, so I heard.
I know all about your little plan to take off with Sean.
One rejection and you run away crying.
I'm not running, and I'm certainly not crying.
No wonder I got the wrong idea, the way you flirt with me all the time.
Are you serious?
I'm sorry I called you a traitor.
This is really amazing of you.
It's just we kind of want to get paid.
Oh.

As per usual.

Well, you can shut up.

It's nothing to do with you, mate.

Dylan's plan for you to leave has nothing to do with your birthday.
He tried to kiss me and now he's running away because I shot him down.
I knew it.

I should have trusted me gut.
God dammit, Greg.

You're an arsehole, Dyl.
Sean?

I didn't do anything with her until I knew for sure that she didn't fancy you.
He's just covering his ass, as he always does.
Always out for himself.
So why am I taking him to Nepal, then, for his birthday?
Making his dream come true?
My what?

Nepal.
You had a massive poster in your room when we were kids of Everest.
That wasn't my poster, Dyl.
That was yours, you selfish prick.
OK, OK.

We don't want any trouble.
OK, so maybe I forgot whose thing Nepal is.
But you'll love it.
I know you will.

You always know what's best for me.
You knew this whole stupid trip would be so good for me, because I'm some kind of idiot.
Because my clothes are shit, I've got the wrong suitcase, or I don't read Keroucac or go university or any of that shit.
It's Kerouac, actually.

It's Kerouac.
Sean!

Dylan, come on.

Oh, my God!

Dylan!

Think about what you're doing, guys.

Oh, that's not mine!
You are all fired!

Sean?

Where's the gruesome twosome?
Don't know.

Entire life to sort out in less than an hour.
Maybe I should stay and help.
No, you and Greg should go to your zombie dinner.

We won't get paid now, so don't turn down free food.
Sean did get something right.
Time to stop letting people tell me I'm not good enough.
I mean, really, if Dylan can get a degree...
I don't deserve to wear it, May.

I don't deserve to wear it.
Detection, family liaison, negotiation, even keeping the peace

I've failed at everything, May!
No.

Duck.

Lauren will charge you for that!
I'd like to see her try.
I've got nothing left, May.
And I'll tell you what, she'll get short shrift from Mrs Levell if she tries to track me down.

My mother.
More beer!
Oh, look at that!
Yeah, yeah!
That is lovely!

Oh, lovely!
Up you're bum!
Oh, my God.
Can a man not get a break?
Hello.
Our father says a friend of May's is a friend of ours and therefore welcome to stay... even though he pointed a gun at them.
Well...

This is awful, I can't do this.
Wait, what if this is a second chance?
Forget about the gun stuff, what did they actually say about the bottle openers?
I didn't get a chance to show them.
There was so much screaming.
Have you got one with you now?

There you are.

OK, come on.
What's she saying?

Sorry, what are you saying?

I am reliable.

Tell them that I once supplied John Lewis.

We'll give them 10% off if they buy a thousand.
If they buy the whole lot, 20% off...
If they buy it now.

Hey, dude, quick.
I need Wi-Fi, have you got Wi-Fi?
I've got like two minutes to send something.
Here's the password.

The Internet's down at the hostel.
I'm only here to send my statement.
I am back!
I'm back like Take That.
Yeah, well done in there.
No, no, no, no, no, it was nothing.
Business is easy when you stick to the three C's - commitment, confidence and communication.
Oi, we've got a Mayday, Mayday.
Hm?

So, what did you write in the end?
That I messed up cos people expected me to.
I decided to be honest.
Ash, I-I-I-I like you.
I have since I met you in Beijing.
Why didn't you just tell me?
Cos I'm an idiot.
No, you're not.
There, there they are!

He's gone!

Seanos, from Dylan.
Dear Wallies, I'm more sorry than I can say.
You're all better off without me.
I deserve to be alone.
I just need to be by myself to find myself.
It's a full-on forlorn Captain Oates.

No, he's a Quaker not a captain.
Captain Oates says the... "I'm going out now, may be some time."
He's gone to Nepal, to Everest.
We need to get him back.
Book some flights.
It's a search and rescue.
How?

I've sold the bottle openers.

Come on!
Let's go.
Come on, Mavis, we've got a man down.
That is a 10-53, all units.
You do know today was your last day as a cop, Greg?

Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.
Eyes peeled, people, this is like a big old game of hide and seek.
You!

Oh, wait, you're sweaty.

OK, thanks.

I didn't know you had a sister, May.
You want me to scrub the whole square?

From Kathmandu to Chicago O'Hare, departing tomorrow at 11:35am.
