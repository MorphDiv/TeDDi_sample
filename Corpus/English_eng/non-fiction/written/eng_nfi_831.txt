In the criminal justice system, sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous.
In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit.
These are their stories.
We're 45 seconds out to air.
Hair and makeup, you have 15 seconds.
Camera two, ready.
30 seconds to air.
Thanks for being here, Olivia.
I feel like I haven't seen you in forever.
Just, you know, a little nervous right now.
What are we waiting for, the damn actress?
I'm such a fan of Ms. Delucci,
We're ready when you are, Mr. Coyle.
In five, four...
Good morning from New York City.
Thank you for joining us on "HNT Morning Live."
Also joining us today, Golden Globe winner
Davina Delucci and Manhattan SVU's Lieutenant
Davina Delucci has alleged she was raped, on camera, by her co-star, while filming the movie's infamous sex scene.
Davina is pursuing legal action.
We'll hear her story, but first,
Lieutenant Benson, what can you tell us
Does this ring true for you, Davina?
You waited almost ten years to go public.
Yes, I was scared if I said anything
Dante told me the scene was being re-written.
He just told me to... respond in the moment organically.
And what happened while filming?
Then Dante got aggressive.
Before I knew what was happening, he was raping me.
I couldn't fight him off.
I was frozen.
You couldn't move.
That's right.
For ten years audiences thought they were watching a love scene, but they were watching a rape.
My rape.
And I was too afraid to say anything.
So, you pretended like nothing happened.
Yes.
And you were afraid for your job.
Yes.
I can't imagine what you were going through.
A very, um... um... disturbing story.
We'll be back after the break with our special guest
Karl Rove.
Harold Coyle raped me in January,
Okay, I think we need to speak.
What I said, I didn't mean any of it.
I can't imagine what you were going through.
Of course you can't, George, it never happened to you.
You all saw that, right?
They couldn't cut away fast enough.
Yeah, and then she told me
Heard a lot of rumors about that guy.
We met at a "Women in New York" panel years ago.
Okay, did she give you any more details?
Oh, no, she back-tracked.
She's now not returning my calls.
This guy says urgent.
I saw you on "HNT" this morning.
Heidi Sorenson, she was talking about
He assaulted my wife.
This is her, Amy.
She worked in public relations at "HNT."
He kept pressuring her, making sexual comments.
She went along with it.
Then one day, she said "no" to him.
And he... raped her.
Can I ask why you didn't?
She told me Harold had taped her.
He had made it look like they were having an affair.
Then after he raped her, he said, if she went to the police, he'd release the tapes.
She didn't want to hurt me.
After that... she went into a depression.
She committed suicide six months later.
I'm so sorry.
I want you to go after that bastard and the network.
They all knew about him and nobody did a thing.
Coyle threatened her directly?
His producer, Turner.
Actually, we're here about Amy James.
Yeah, did you also hear she accused Harold Coyle of assault, just like Heidi?
Maybe you should talk to our lawyers.
The tapes Coyle was blackmailing her with.
I think you're off base here.
We have two allegations of assault.
Now, a publicist who's mentally unstable, she's easy to discredit, but the star of the network, not so much.
Harold, Harold, Harold, what can you tell us about Heidi?
Margery, what's next for you at "HNT"?
I hope to follow in Heidi's footsteps.
She's a real talent, a dedicated journalist.
The real reason Heidi had her "breakdown"?
She was trying to renegotiate her contract.
Then she found out Margery Evans is being groomed
This is a brutal business for women.
There's a shelf life.
No matter how much plastic surgery they get.
_
I told you I didn't want to talk.
Is it true that you're re-negotiating
Is that why you don't wanna tell me the truth about what happened this morning?
I should never have said his name out loud like that.
Or because you're scared of getting fired?
Okay, let's say it is true.
I'm not ruining my career because I had a weak moment.
I fixed it.
I apologized to Harold personally.
He knows it won't happen again.
Did you know Amy James?
We can fight this.
Don't judge me.
Uh, Lieutenant, Chief Dodds is here.
You're investigating Harold Coyle on assault charges?
It's very preliminary.
Who's the complainant?
It's really very preliminary.
Your detectives are basically throwing
I hope you're not advising we stay away from "HNT"?
Just have a damn good reason.
I hear you, Chief.
I'll leave you two to it.
So, happy to be back at work yet?
Good night, Noah.
All right, see you in the morning.
See you in the morning.
I'm sorry to bother you at home.
What's going on?
They are replacing me with Margery Evans.
Officially, I'm "on vacation."
When I went to apologize to Harold, he forced me onto my knees, and he said I had to show him how serious I was.
I actually thought that would work, that I'd get my job back.
He screwed me in private, that's one thing, but he just screwed me in public.
And you're ready to go after Coyle now?
I know what it looks like.
That I'm doing this because I got fired,
Let's get this guy.
It started day one, my job interview.
Coyle said to me, "Oh, you're beautiful,
"you're bright, you could be a star.
"But I interviewed five other women today,
"that are just as qualified and I'm going to hire whoever shows me she wants it the most."
And then what happened?
He put his hand inside my blouse.
Uh, and his tongue in my mouth.
I was shocked, frozen.
But I didn't run out of the room
Kissing, groping.
He would demand that I wear... lacy panties, thigh-high stockings.
Before I went on the air, I'd have to give him a private fashion show and pretend to seduce him, and he would tape me.
And I didn't think things could get any worse,
Tell us about that.
The ratings were high and my contract was up and I told Coyle, if he wanted me to stay at "HNT,"
I wanted a promotion.
He...
He locked the door, threw me onto a couch, pulled up my skirt... and he raped me.
I fought him... but I couldn't get away.
He said if I complained, he'd release the tapes that he had or worse.
And that if I wasn't happy at the morning show, he'd hire Margery Evans.
So you didn't report it.
No.
I straightened myself up, walked out, and I went back to work.
Like a good girl.
Like a good, stupid girl.
Did you confide in anyone?
The irony is, Margery was the one person I told.
I was trying to warn her.
_
Thank you for talking to us, Ms. Evans.
I'm a little nervous.
Margery wants to cooperate, but, um, we need to protect ourselves here.
Okay, but she's not a suspect.
No, of course not.
You said you had questions about Heidi?
Yeah.
How would you describe your relationship?
I consider her a friend.
What about her relationship with Harold Coyle?
It's very good.
They've had their dust ups, on occasion.
Has Heidi ever talked to you about how
Well, she told us that she confided in you that she'd been assaulted by him.
I don't remember that.
She never told you about being sexually harassed by Coyle?
She never warned you about Coyle?
Never.
Is that what she's telling the police?
If that's all, Detectives, I think that constitutes full cooperation.
I don't know why Heidi would say something like that.
You think any woman would go public and subject herself to that kind of public scrutiny if it weren't true?
Well, I don't believe it's true.
That's not the Harold Coyle I know.
Harold Coyle values three things in a female anchor:
high cheekbones, long legs, and how willing she is to get down on her knees.
Yeah, we've been getting that.
He's a paranoid egomaniac, who has intel on everyone.
Internal investigations dead-ended.
Did you know Coyle was harassing her?
She's making a criminal complaint
Actually, she's saying that Coyle raped her.
Jeez.
So that's what that was about yesterday.
She says it happened the morning of January 3rd.
You two did a show that day?
Well, yeah, now that I think about it.
She's been off the past few months.
Crying jags, snapping at the crew.
I wasn't surprised she melted down on camera.
Would you be willing to tell that to our ADA?
I hate Coyle, but my contract expires in six months.
I get on his bad side, it's not like I can walk around his office in my underwear and make it all go away.
Everybody at "HNT" knows about Coyle, but nobody's willing to talk about it.
Okay, par for the course.
I was hoping for at least one corroborating witness.
Well, we have Heidi's story and once she came forward, she's been consistent.
Any change after the alleged assault?
Well, there's no communication saying, "Why did you rape me?"
And there's certainly nothing from him to her.
What about the timeline?
She got to work at 6:00.
She was in with him from 6:20 to 7:10.
Behind closed doors with no witnesses.
Look, I think it's time for us to get his side of the story.
With no evidence for leverage?
He doesn't know that.
And he's notoriously paranoid.
Okay, we'll talk to him.
Together.
You don't think that I can handle it alone?
I do, but I want him to know how seriously NYPD is taking this.
_
Well, thanks for seeing us today.
Of course.
My attorney, Richard Pace.
Chief Dodds, Lieutenant Benson.
So why are we all here?
Well, we'd like to talk to your client about Heidi Sorenson.
A wonderful talent.
She's been under a lot of stress lately.
Can you tell us about your relationship with her?
Yes, she is.
Have you two ever been in your office alone together?
Okay, how about on January 3rd?
I'd have to ask my secretary.
Well, I'm shocked to hear that.
I can assure you, these allegations are credible.
And I can assure you, there's no merit to the story.
Oh, I don't see the upside of her making something like that up.
She's aging out of the demo.
She's obviously looking to leverage us.
She hasn't hired a civil attorney.
She came directly to me.
When did she come to you?
After she found out she was being replaced by Margery Evans?
We just wanna hear your side.
To know what we're looking at here.
Any sexual assault claims are baseless, more than false, and from where I sit,
I just want to remind you that this organization is in the business of uncovering and exposing...
That's a matter of opinion.
The point is... if there's anything to find, we'll find it.
Like who was responsible for Sergeant Mike Dodds' death.
And why the internal investigation was closed in less than 24 hours.
Okay.
We're done here.
I think we can all agree this meeting has ceased to be productive.
And I think we know what we're looking at here.
Rest assured, we will continue to investigate.
I know NYPD's year hasn't been as disastrous as say, Chicago's, but I'm sure no one at 1PP wants stories about incompetence, maybe corruption, dominating the news cycle.
The thing about digging, you never know what you're going to find.
What he implied about Mike's death...
That's what they do at this network, stoke fear and paranoia.
I don't think you're responsible.
I know a few months ago I said some things... things I didn't mean.
I should've apologized sooner.
The only thing I can say is... the wound was still fresh.
I know.
And we don't give up this fight.
You stop fighting, the bullies win.
I've always considered Harold Coyle a mentor.
So you haven't experienced the kind of harassment at "HNT"
that Heidi Sorenson is alleging?
Absolutely not.
And you know, Harold and I have discussed this, and I can tell you he's incredibly hurt.
He's treated Heidi with nothing but respect.
Margery's a real pro.
He's just playing hardball.
So, Heidi, did you tell anyone about the assault?
Look, I know that you want to go after Coyle, criminally, but the fact is...
You might have more leverage pursuing a civil case.
This isn't about money.
Do you know a Gwendolyn Gates?
Yeah, she was an anchor at "HNT" ten years ago.
She's on her way to our squad room.
She says that Harold Coyle assaulted her, too.
I turned on the TV, saw Margery Evans spouting that inane defense of Harold.
I couldn't stay silent any longer.
Tell us what happened with Coyle.
You're gonna need more paper.
So "HNT" is doing our job for us?
The more audacity they have with their denials, the more it's back-firing.
Liv, two more women that worked for "HNT"
say they were harassed by Harold Coyle.
Well, now we're getting somewhere.
Get their statements.
All right, so we got four women, all former "HNT" employees, with credible stories of harassment going back 15 years.
They're all allegations of misdemeanor assault, from over two years ago.
Outside of the statue of limitations.
Except for Heidi's rape which is a he said, she said.
And one allegation of attempted rape.
Alana Reed, 20 years old.
She quit right after the incident.
George Thanos' assistant and he already hates Coyle.
And this gives him one more reason.
She was 20 years old just like my daughter.
Maybe she thought you wouldn't believe her.
Maybe she thought you wouldn't back her up.
Like Heidi.
Heidi and I have been behind a news desk, in the foxhole, for seven years.
Nobody has her back more than I do.
Then act like it.
Testify that you saw how upset she was after the rape.
We need someone to back up her story up.
I want to, I do, but I can't.
George, you said you had a daughter, right?
Well, she must've heard about this on the news.
She hasn't ask you what you know?
What you're doing about it?
This is a Kamikaze career move.
This of it like this, you'll go down as a hero.
_
On one count of first degree rape of Heidi Sorenson,
My client has no priors, and fully intends to show up in court and defend himself against these baseless charges.
Bail is set at $2 million and Mr. Coyle surrenders his passport.
I hope you know what you're doing.
It's good to see you, Harold.
Good luck.
Careful what you wish for.
Now what?
I file a motion to include the testimony of the four other victims.
The defense files a motion to exclude.
Okay, you know the other women are pursuing
I already asked for the depositions.
Hope to hell the judge agrees that they show pattern or we're looking at a he said, she said with a man who has no compunction about lying.
My name is Alana Reed.
I was an employee of "HNT"
from January to December of 2016.
I'm Christine Davis.
I had just started at the network.
It was four and a half years ago.
I was a production assistant on "HNT Update."
I was introduced to Coyle at an awards dinner.
He invited me to audition for an opening in broadcasting.
He pulled out some stockings from his drawer,
Put a hand on my shoulder.
Eventually... he tried to kiss me.
I didn't know what to do.
At first it wasn't so bad.
He'd say, "Lift your skirt, show me those legs."
Putting his... tongue in my mouth.
If I complained, he'd remind me,
I didn't feel like I could tell anyone.
I mean, he was the head of the network.
I...
I thought that since I didn't leave the room...
That's why I never came forward.
Until now.
_
Gentlemen, I've reviewed the depositions at issue and am prepared to hear arguments.
The State had the opportunity to bring them as criminal charges, but declined to do so.
These women's statements clearly show motive, and the same MO, in each case.
The jury needs to hear them to understand that the rape that Coyle is charged with is part of a broader pattern of conduct.
The only question before the jury should be the facts of the specific charge.
Anything else would be extremely prejudicial in this case.
Mr. Barba, while I find these statements to be important evidence, I agree with defense, that in this case, it would be more prejudicial than probative.
People's motion is denied.
Not the ruling I was hoping for.
Heidi Sorenson and George Thanos.
Is that enough to go to trial?
If I'm willing to go out on a very high, very shaky limb.
I assume that's a yes?
Damn right it is.
And you were afraid for your job.
I can't imagine what you were going through.
Of course you can't, George, 'cause it never happened to you.
You were seated next to Ms. Sorenson.
In your experience as an SVU, Lieutenant, what can you tell us?
In my opinion, she exhibited symptoms of a victim of sexual assault.
But when you tried to follow up, she refused to speak to you?
No, she had an emotional reaction and then she backed down which is not uncommon.
Two days later, she did disclose that
That was well-timed.
A "spontaneous" disclosure of assault when the SVU Lieutenant was in the studio.
It's your experience to believe most victims
Heidi initially reversed herself, saying she didn't mean what she said?
At that point, did she repeat her allegations
I do not think that her motivation was financial then and I do not think it's financial now.
But, as you said, you're a believer, Lieutenant.
Is there a question here, Your Honor?
Harold Coyle fondled my breasts, and put his tongue in my mouth, during my job interview.
It escalated from there.
At dinner the night before I started at "HNT,"
he tried to convince me to have sex and I declined.
How did he respond?
He said he controlled my career and that no one said no to the boss and he was gonna have to fix that.
How did he "fix" it?
He forced me to dance provocatively in lingerie.
I would have to touch myself while being taped.
Why did you go along with it?
There was always the underlying threat of being fired and he'd... he... he... he tortured me psychologically.
I-I felt trapped.
What happened on the morning of January 3rd this year?
He pushed me onto a couch... he pinned me down...
Did you call the police?
I was afraid for my job.
I had trouble sleeping and eating, being on camera.
Until one day,
I couldn't keep it in any longer.
I needed to tell the truth.
At financial and career cost?
Yeah.
I'll never work at "HNT" again.
My future is uncertain.
Thank you.
Ms. Sorenson, have you, at any time, been in contact with a civil attorney?
I spoke to someone, but I decided
Yes, I'm aware.
Yet you're not pursuing that route.
Are you waiting until after the disposition of the criminal trial, which would be a smart strategy?
Nothing further.
You may step down, Ms. Sorenson.
Next witness, Mr. Barba.
I'll need a recess, Your Honor.
Yeah, that's understandable, but it doesn't change the fact that Harold Coyle is guilty of sexual assault.
I'm telling you, I can't testify.
What the hell's going on here, George?
His trolls are going after my daughter.
She's got a juvie record for drugs they got a hold of.
They're threatening to go public.
We all know how that goes.
I still have a chance to protect one woman in my life from Coyle... my daughter.
I've worked at "HNT" for four years.
Harold has always behaved like a gentleman, a mentor, a great boss.
What was your impression of Heidi Sorenson's relationship with Harold?
I never sensed a problem or issue.
Heidi was always so upbeat.
So she never expressed any dissatisfaction, or complained about being harassed?
Your Honor, objection to this line of questioning.
It's pure speculation.
Overruled, but move along, Mr. Pace.
Tuesday, January 3rd of this year,
We spent about an hour in hair and make-up together.
Sunny.
She was telling me how much fun she had on New Year's Eve at the Ritz Carlton in Puerto Rico.
So not the demeanor of a woman
Ms. Evans, you replaced Heidi on "HNT's" morning show after she accused Harold Coyle of sexual assault, correct?
That's right, but the conversations had been
$10 million a year?
That in the ballpark?
So the jury has to decide whether they're gonna believe me or Margery?
Do you really have no idea what kind of a man
Not to the dozens of women that Harold harassed.
No, she needs to hear this.
He promised you my job.
What else did he promise you?
There's a cost, Margery.
You know, you may think that you have to do whatever Coyle asks of you.
Perjure yourself on the stand, let him treat you like you have no value, and then just discard you when he's through.
It doesn't have to be that way.
He would never do that to me.
Never.
I'm sorry for whatever it was that happened to you...
But I'm not you.
_
I'm just checking in.
Come in.
I am so happy you came.
I thought I'd see how you were doing
Drink?
You do know the trial's not over yet.
Yes, it is.
The jury's looking at Heidi and you know what they see?
A cold, calculating, aging career woman with dollar signs in her sights.
But you did rape her.
The truth isn't important.
What's important is what you can get people to believe.
Now, how about that celebration?
I like that idea.
What'd you have in mind?
I can think of a lot of things.
I like the way you think.
Defending you and taking the stand.
Now I need a show of good faith.
I want my tape back.
Margery, I'd never use that tape against you.
Well, then, respectfully, I'd like it back.
Wherever you keep those tapes, you get mine and hand it over.
I'll wait.
Wow.
Now you're demanding.
I'm serious, Harold.
Now that I have the new position, we can start over.
Have a real, professional relationship.
Actually, I have another idea.
It's time to show me how much.
Take off your clothes.
Get on your knees.
Margery...
Come on now.
I managed to fight him off and run out.
You took a huge risk, Margery.
Had to find out for myself.
I thought I was different.
I wasn't.
I realize I perjured myself on the stand.
I'm willing to re-testify.
That's good to hear.
We're looking at misdemeanor forcible touching, at least.
The jury sees that, plus Margery's testimony, you get convicted of rape-1.
That damn bitch.
Okay, see you in trial.
Let's start talking.
_
I know it doesn't look like much now, but with a few million from "HNT,"
this will be the new office space for Step Up.
Mentoring and empowering teenage girls.
What an incredible use of the settlement.
I wasn't sure you were gonna take it.
Well, Margery convinced me.
I'll take some time to travel, figure out my next move.
Maybe I'll write a tell-all.
You won't miss the business?
Actually, no.
For as long as I can remember, I've been beholden to Coyle and ratings, corporate mandates.
You know, I-I finally feel free.
Thank you, Olivia.
Congratulations.
Good luck.
Chief, how can I help you?
I wanted to congratulate you.
"HNT" is back on their financial heels and Coyle will do 18 months.
Well, the guy just couldn't help himself.
The tortoise and the scorpion.
I'm sorry?
Scorpion asks a tortoise for a ride across the lake.
The tortoise says, "Well, sure, as long as you don't sting me."
Scorpion says, "Why would I sting you?"
"We'd both drown." So they start off.
"Why the hell did you do that?"
And the scorpion says, "Because it's in my nature."
Oh, you do know that one.
I guess the scorpions keep us in business.
Yeah.
Well...
I've barged into your office enough for one week.
Please, any time.
I, uh...
I guess I've been avoiding SVU.
Every time I walk in the place...
I think I'm gonna see Mike... sitting at his desk.
Not at all.
I'll see you, Olivia.
I'll see you, Chief.
