Well, if it isn't the invisible man.
Yeah.
Well, my undercover assignment, it's wrapped.
How was it?
It was great.
Yeah, I learned a lot.
Glad to hear it.
So now I'm back.
All right, well, dig out your blues.
Talk to Platt in the morning.
Welcome back.
You're knocking me back down to patrol?
You know, actually, Adam, you were never assigned up here.
You had the privilege to be detailed.
All right.
I mean, I feel like I did good work up here.
I had to find out from the commander in Seven that you'd been detailed to Detached Services.
You left me one man short with a bunch of people asking me questions I couldn't answer.
My ex-fianc√© was coming upstairs, so I freaked out a little bit.
I needed to clear my head, which I did.
So, boss, I mean,
Intelligence, this is where I want to be.
I'll keep that in mind if something opens up.
All right, appreciate it, Sarge.
Oh, Ruzek.
Just keep doing the job.
What's up, Scrap?
Another day in paradise.
I told him you got my tab.
Eh, if it's worth me coming all the way down here.
Thank you.
What's going on?
There's a guy in town, looking to hire a hit man.
How did you go from boosting cases of liquor to being a triggerman?
It was a friend of a friend who was approached, and they reached out to me to see if I know anyone.
There are a lot of things that I can do, but pretending to be a hit man is not one of them.
So if I call another detective down here, you better not be jerking me off.
I'm telling you, Erin, it's for real.
Al, this is Scrap.
We've known each other since we were kids.
Am I hearing right, you got a solicitation for murder?
Yeah.
But I need a promise from the PD first.
My kid brother, Frankie, he owes some guys money who you don't want to owe money to.
He went south to pick up a car for them.
He got popped, with 100 pounds of weed in the trunk.
100 pounds?
You said it was a little bit of weed.
I'm offering you murder-for-hire.
That's gotta trump any amount of weed.
I'll give you this guy who wants a hit man, but you got to get Frankie out of jail.
Do we got a deal?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Hey, that thing we talked about, I got a guy.
I'm with him right now.
I'll come to you.
You guys got eyes?
Flash 'em.
Good.
Yeah.
I didn't know if you like cream or sugar, so.
So how does this work?
We go to your room, talk details.
Um, yeah, I'm not looking for that.
I'm looking for a wire.
Well, cops don't tape microphones to people's chests anymore.
FYI.
What do I call you?
Pulaski.
You have a daughter, Pulaski?
No.
I did.
Two months ago, this piece of garbage, Omar Fry, murdered her, and walked.
She was only 22.
Her life was just beginning.
I'll pay you 50 grand to kill him.
Rebecca Clark.
That's the girl that moved here and was gunned down in Bronzeville a couple months back, right?
That's right, she'd only been in Chicago six months before she got killed.
Happened when she pulled over to buy a bottle of water at a corner store.
Shot with a .45 semi-auto.
Father is Donald Clark.
He is a poetry professor at West Michigan College.
Mother's in a mental institution.
Checked herself in after Rebecca's death.
She couldn't handle it.
So who's he want dead?
Uh, Omar Fry.
He's a documented South Ave hustler, prime suspect in Rebecca's murder.
Gang Intelligence and Area Central Homicide both cleared him, so he was released a few weeks ago.
Since then, open murder investigation, no other suspects.
Now, Clark is convinced that Omar Fry's the guy who killed his daughter.
All right, Jay, you and Atwater hit Homan Square.
See if you can dig up the original gang file.
Kenny, you and Burgess go pay Omar Fry a visit.
What's the next step with Clark?
Let's see if we can get some perspective on the original homicide first, shed some light on who actually killed his daughter.
Yo, Sarge, uh, I heard Ruzek's back.
Yeah, he's back at 21, yeah, but he's not back up here.
Copy that.
Good morning, Sergeant.
Hey, Erin.
So I have a CI, put us onto a major felony.
In exchange, I need to get his brother out of Cook County.
Well, you know, I'd love to help but there's more steps than this.
Especially since it's a snitch's relative and not the actually snitch.
Come on, Sergeant, I made a promise.
I made a promise too, Detective.
I promised to truly serve our sovereign county and state as a police officer without favor, affection, malice, or ill will!
Uh-huh.
What's up?
So I, uh, had a PI friend look into Rebecca's case.
Omar Fry, he was cleared on all charges.
You... you do know that, right?
Yeah, that's what the detective said.
You know, with the murder rate here, what the hell do Chicago cops know, right?
All right.
But now if it turns out that this Fry isn't the guy, you know, you don't get a refund?
I know in my heart he did it.
All right, I'm gonna need, uh, 10% up front for a new barrel and a set of wheels.
Listen, you want this not be traced back to us?
I'm gonna need an untraceable gun, and I'm not gonna pull up in my own personal vehicle to do this, all right?
Look, it's your job, it's fine.
Yeah.
All right, so, just so we understand each other, once you start this, there's no turning back.
Just bring my little girl some justice.
You guys got your work cut out for you, dealing with all these cliques, huh?
So what do you got for us?
Uh, Rebecca's murder wasn't a typical
"mutual combatant" killing.
It was an innocent girl new to the city.
So the mayor's office gave us a directive to saturate the area.
And you guys like Omar Fry for it?
He was recorded on a security camera at a corner store buying a tallboy, where Rebecca had purchased a bottle of water approximately a minute later.
We assumed he followed her to her car and it was a robbery gone sideways.
Mm, so now you cleared Omar?
Yeah, we never found a murder weapon.
He passed the gun residue test.
We got no confession.
Have we given Rebecca's dad this information?
He's in town now, asking a lot of questions.
Yeah, he showed up after Omar got released.
Almost had him arrested, he was so worked up.
Even when I showed him the evidence, he wouldn't listen.
Stab away.
I got ten cases here that I haven't even read yet.
Thank you.
I got a medical card around here somewhere.
Wanna see it?
After what you all put me through, accusing me of shooting that girl, doctor said I got PTSD.
Only thing that cures it is the kush.
Omar, we have to ask you about that case.
Ah, been there, done that.
I spent two weeks down at 26th and Cal, ducking shanks and eating bologna sandwiches for something I didn't do.
Daddy, who are they?
Just some police officers, baby, making sure we all right around here.
Go back and read your books.
You know, only pimps still carry money clips.
So any idea who might have killed Rebecca?
I'm supposed to help you guys now?
Just take the money.
Buy your kid some new books.
The gang detectives,
I didn't like how they disrespected me.
So there's something I didn't tell 'em.
I walked out of that corner store, sipping my beer.
I'm halfway down the block when I hear this pop-pop-pop.
'Course I knew it was something going off, so I looked back.
You saw who did it?
Nah.
But I saw this dude in a shiny hoodie run to the other side of the street and duck into the Red Line tunnel.
The one on 47th and Wentworth?
Running like he was just shooting.
And I know what that looks like.
All right, search the drainage grates along all the stairwells.
Bangers file the gates loose, use them to hide contraband.
They get spotted topside, come down here to sling away their guns or drugs.
I suggest you all split up.
I got three pennies and half a dozen cigarette butts.
Well, I got a used condom and four rat-sized roaches.
So don't complain.
Yeah.
I ran into Ruzek last night.
Yeah?
He came looking for his desk.
Just curious, where do you stand on that?
Him coming back?
I don't know, it sounds like Voight just shut the door on that, so.
Well, yeah, but... where do you stand on it?
You've been great, Kenny.
A real asset.
Bob Ruzek, that's... that's his old man, right?
Just asking.
When I was stationed in Kabul, I lost a bet, and I had to cover up the latrines with a shovel for like a month.
And I would take this over that any day.
Hold up.
Check this out.
What is that?
I think we have a murder weapon.
Had the lab rush the test on our gun.
The ballistics are 100% match to the rounds they pulled out of Rebecca Clark's body.
Any prints or DNA?
I ran the gun through the CAGE unit and it came back registered to a Thomas Kade.
Turns out he has been on CPD's radar the last few weeks, identified as
"a person of interest" in illegal gun sales.
Yeah, but what's his connection to Rebecca?
We're still working on that part.
Kade has a fake Federal Firearms License and he's a known straw buyer.
So he's probably not our shooter.
More likely, he sold the gun to whoever killed Rebecca.
You got an address?
Yeah, uh, it's a business called Smoke Bliss on 44th and Calumet.
Wait, the head shop?
I drive by it on my way to work.
Let's go have a look.
Hey, Hank, I got to be honest.
Something's not equating with me.
What's that?
Well, Donald Clark.
Why don't we let him loose?
He solicited a murder, Al.
Not like we haven't done worse.
You know, for our kids.
Let's see how it plays out.
C-can I help you guys?
Thomas Kade.
Where is he?
I don't know who you're talking about.
He just comes in once in a while to do business!
Which business?
Weed or guns?
I don't ask any questions, man.
I just run the shop!
Take it off the hinges.
Hey.
Wow.
Either you tell me where Kade is, or I'm thinking these are your guns.
Yo, I'm gonna need two upstairs!
Hey, seize these weapons.
Unh!
Yeah!
CPD!
Nice and slow, drop your weapons.
Hands up on your head and get down on your knees.
Yo, I ain't kneeling for nobody in my own home.
Put your hands behind your back.
Don't move.
What's up with Frankie?
Why's he not been sprung yet?
I told you I'm working on it.
Well, work harder.
My brother don't deserve to be locked up.
Dude, I don't just snap my fingers and he's out.
There's a process to this.
When I got news, I'll call you.
Call me?
How about I call this Donald cat right now, tell him it's all a setup?
Tell him he's meeting with an undercover cop?
Nah, I think I'll call him right now.
You want to be stupid?
Turn around.
For what?
You're under arrest.
Turn around.
What am I under arrest for?
For having a big mouth.
Hey, those crates of guns we found in the back of Smoke Bliss, they came back seized from the ATF in multiple states.
They were stolen from a melt-down truck on their way to be destroyed in Indiana.
So this guy, Kade, ripped off a load of seized guns from the ATF?
And then he got himself a fake Firearms License and started selling them?
I know, Sarge, something doesn't add up.
Rebecca Clark.
Never heard of her.
Yeah?
Well, one of your guns was used in her murder, so either you shot her yourself or you sold that to her killer.
I know people.
I'll never do a day in jail.
He knows people.
Oh, in that case, we should let him go.
Yeah.
Who'd you sell the guns to?
I like this kind of party.
This is Group Supervisor Greg Hammet from the ATF.
You need to release him right now.
He's not going anywhere.
Well, he's an undercover federal agent, so it's best you uncuff him.
Told you.
I know people.
All right, back up a second.
So what is this operation?
We got over 1,000 hours of manpower on this case so far.
So I understand, the ATF didn't deconflict this operation with CPD or any other agency?
No-no-no, it's classified deep cover.
No offense, look, guys, as soon as we tell local PD, we, uh, we know it's burned.
Yeah, man, I was just getting into character.
You know how undercover works, you gotta sell it.
All right, guys, look, we surveil all activities.
You understand, any guns sold were tracked by their serial numbers.
Arrests were made if they were used in a crime, taking major offenders off of your streets.
One of your guns was used to kill an innocent 22-year-old girl, so exactly how many firearms have you lost track of?
No, we don't lose track of anything.
All right, look, look, is any operation 100% ironclad?
Uh, you know, maybe a few guns fell through the cracks, we lost track, but we have made over 80 felony arrests so far.
What's important here is the victim.
We're in agreement on that same page.
So what can we do to help?
I need the reports on everyone you sold guns to and every piece of surveillance you got.
So you're gonna jeopardize our whole operation?
Your operation is jeopardized.
You're through in my city.
I mean, you got a problem with that?
Just ask around about Hank Voight.
Yeah, we already did.
Listen, you can have the files.
Just, uh, preserve the work we've done here.
Hey, Sarge.
Hey.
Looks like I'm working down here for a while.
Uh, actually, Commander Crowley wants you to report to the 27th District.
They need bodies for their third shifts.
The graveyard shift.
Wha...
Graveyard shift.
Come here.
Come over here, come on.
Look, you did the right thing.
You were uncomfortable with the situation, so you removed yourself from it.
All right, well, if I did the right thing, then why am I getting punished for it?
Because that's life, Adam.
So you know what you do?
You put your head down, you do the job, and you work your way back, one shift at a time.
27th District?
Like I said, one shift at a time.
Go on.
Thanks, Sarge.
Uh, my, uh, PI guy, he says it might not be Fry after all.
So I came by to ask you one last time.
You sure you want to do this?
You know, I was...
I was just thinking about Rebecca.
This one time, she broke her leg.
We were camping.
And uh, I had to carry her into town in my arms.
I felt, uh...
It's a feeling you'd only understand if you had kids, but...
Hey, man, if you ever want to call if off, we can.
I mean, I already spent the up front money, but you keep the rest and you pretend that we never met.
I, uh, I'll be in touch with you.
All right, the ATF supplied us with all their UC reports, including listings of all the weapons and individuals that they sold to, including photos and video surveillance of every purchase.
Now, this is Maxwell Clay,
AKA Gold Fish.
This guy has priors for gun and narcotics possession.
This guy preparing for war?
Well, he's his own mini-straw buyer, so he buys the guns from Tucker and sells them out of his bar.
Gold Fish is definitely the worst street name I've ever heard.
I knew a guy named Poodlehead.
Poodlehead, that's definitely the worst street name I've ever heard.
Okay, Gold Fish runs a dive in Kenwood.
All right, let's go snatch his ass up.
Oh, your car got downed by the Area.
They're switching out some of the old 1505 cars.
What do we get to replace it?
GMC Sierra, brand-new.
Um.
Please, can we talk?
Okay, this is my dream rig.
You know this, I've probably mentioned it in my sleep.
Now, I've rode shotgun since day one, with no complaint.
It's time you drove, grasshopper.
Ooh.
Oh, that's nice.
Hands up.
Higher.
This better be good.
I got all my permits up to date with the city.
Yeah, well, we're here about guns, Goldy.
Man, I just sling drinks.
Uh-huh.
Whoa.
What, like a nine millimeter with a .380 chaser?
Oops.
Remember this?
That's you and Thomas Kade.
You're buying 23 guns.
Well, guess what.
Kade is an ATF agent.
You telling me that gacked-out white boy was a cop?
That's right.
And one of the guns you sold was used to murder this young woman,
Rebecca Clark.
Uh, everybody wants a strap.
So I sell them on the side for a little bit of cash, but I ain't never shot at nobody in my life.
You better think hard or you're gonna be charged with that murder.
Look, I'm not gonna waste your time.
Yeah, I bought the hardware.
I sold the .45 to my cousin, Big O.
We're gonna need a real name and address.
He's dead.
Sold him a piece 'cause he said he was feeling heat on his block.
A week later, they shot him off of 51st.
Some Latin Player he was beefing with.
But you know how that go.
No one saw nothing.
Hey, what happened to the gun?
I never found it.
Picked it off his body after they shot him.
All right, bring him in.
Check his story.
And write him up for every single one of those weapons.
Think I get this Gold Fish thing now.
Hey, you got State's Attorney Jefferies in your office looking for you.
And he's looking for you too.
So where are we with this murder-for-hire case, Sergeant?
Donald Clark, yeah, well, we're just keeping him on the hook for now until we can shed some more light on who actually killed his daughter.
I'm confused.
Well, we traced the murder weapon back to the guy who bought it.
Turns out that he was killed two weeks before Rebecca Clark, so we're back to square one on our murder.
These are two stand-alone cases.
Totally independent.
But this man came to Chicago, with the express purpose to hire a hit man and pay for a murder, correct?
He put a hit on the wrong guy.
He could have targeted Bozo the Clown for all I care.
You don't think we're obligated to find the actual shooter?
After you have Donald Clark in custody.
Listen, the guy, he's not a criminal.
Because he's a white poetry professor?
No, it's not that.
He's a grieving father.
Oh, let me ask you this.
If it was a black man put a hit on a white kid, would you still feel the same way?
Come on, man.
You got some balls asking me that.
You didn't answer my question.
You know, next month I've been on this job, what, 28 years?
And not once did I ever arrest somebody based on race.
I mean, there's the law, and then there's doing the right thing.
Hey, no one said Clark is gonna walk.
I don't care about right and wrong.
Or we're gonna have a problem.
All right, get Omar Fry down here.
Set up a fake hit that you can show Donald Clark.
Get him on tape giving you the rest of the money.
Listen, Hank, I think I got through to Clark.
Set it up.
Remember the Family Secrets sting?
When I had to cover you in, what, two gallons of pigs blood over you because you were supposed to be stabbed to death?
Hey, so did Detective Lindsay explain everything to you?
Yeah, I'm supposed to get dolled up like I'm dead, and you're gonna take pictures.
But I ain't agreed to nothing yet.
Hey, it only takes 30 minutes.
I give you an execution-style makeover, you lay down, close your eyes for a minute, and I take a few shots.
I don't gotta do nothing for free.
Especially after the police almost ruined my life.
So I hear you got a little girl.
Isn't she gonna be proud when you tell her you helped the CPD?
Think you're tugging on my heart strings?
Two G, or y'all can find somebody else to play dead.
All right, go sign out two dimes from the 1505 fund.
Listen, Al, I...
I know how you feel about Rebecca's dad.
I don't want to hear this.
Just go get the money.
So the .45 we picked off Gold Fish's cousin, Big O, he says it was gang related, apparently some Latin Player.
So we had CPIC and Gang Investigations pull the cards of all known gang members in the Bronzeville area.
It's a dead end on Big O.
They couldn't find any player who was a documented enemy of his.
But they did tell us that the 54th Street Gangsters and the Latin Players have been at each other's throats lately.
So we took a closer look and found something interesting.
Jeremy Reynolds.
26, multiple gang cards, arrested a dozen times.
He was a hardcore 54th Street G.
Then he became inactive.
He got a civilian job at Pioneer Machining.
Guess where that's located.
Ten miles north in Logan Square.
Which is right across the street from Grainger, which is where Rebecca Clark worked as a clerk in Shipping and Receiving.
Well, I mean, we know the Players and the 54th Street G's do have a pretty long history of gang warfare.
How Rebecca Clark got involved, I have no idea, but this could be a retaliation hit, Sarge.
Yeah, well, why don't you start by asking him?
Hey, excuse me, we need to ask you some questions, Jeremy.
About what?
I'd say that's a yes.
Let's clock him out for the day.
Yeah, come on, let's go.
You know what a nexus is, Jeremy?
It's just a $10 word meaning connection.
Like how you're connected to Rebecca Clark, or, more to the point, to her homicide.
I didn't kill her.
But you admit you did know her, right?
We met on a lunch break.
Where we worked, it's all industrial.
Everyone goes to the same strip mall for lunch.
So we went on a date that night, that's all.
So you admit that you were with her that night.
Your first date and she ends up killed.
You see how you're the nexus, Jeremy?
We have a gang card in there that says that you're connected to the 54th Street G's.
You better update your records.
I got out of the life a while ago.
Yeah, but that life always follows you.
You know that.
That's gang retaliation.
What we don't know is were you the target or were you the instigator, Jeremy?
You never saw her like that because you ran as soon as you heard gunshots.
You left that girl to die, didn't even call 911.
Which, by the way, the medical examiner said probably would have saved her life.
Mm-hmm.
Who shot at you, Jeremy?
Who killed Rebecca?
Getting out of the life, that doesn't make me a snitch.
Yeah, what about a human being?
You want to do right by her?
Then help us out.
It just might give you and her some peace.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
You sure?
Yeah.
Carlos Brigante, 26, lifelong Latin Player.
Turns out he's been gunning for Jeremy Reynolds ever since Reynolds shot his baby brother, Pikey Brigante, in the ass two years ago.
Reynolds say what went down?
Yeah, talk about random.
After work, Reynolds and Rebecca Clark, they go out to dinner.
Now, Reynolds doesn't have a car.
So being the nice girl that Rebecca is, she offers to drive him home.
They stop at the corner store just as Brigante happens to be walking by.
He spots Reynolds, pulls his gun, shoots up the car.
Reynolds dives out the passenger side, doesn't get hit once.
So Brigante is our silver hoodie?
That's right, emptied his piece, ran into the Red Line station.
Wrong place, wrong time.
All this over some old beef.
Thanks.
Gang Unit has the location on Brigante.
A Players stash house in Pilsen.
Good.
Chicago PD!
Turn over!
Hey, he's got a vest on.
Dispatch, we got shots fired by the offender and police.
Offender is down with a gunshot to the head.
You all right, girl?
Yeah.
You all right, just breathe.
It's done.
Two in the back of the head.
Oh, my God.
The back half of what you owe me.
Yes, o... okay.
Oh, my God.
It's all there, it's there.
Thank you.
You know, Omar Fry, he didn't kill your daughter.
What do you mean?
But we caught the guy that did.
You're a cop?
I'm sorry.
Oh.
Donald Clark, you're under arrest for the solicitation of murder.
Come in here.
All right.
This is everything you came in with.
It's $33 cash, a Metro pass, your phone, and your shoelaces.
I spoke to the state's attorney.
Your brother's gonna be out in an hour.
Next time I get something,
I'm taking it to my guy in Narcotics.
He won't lock me up for bringing him a score.
I got your brother out on 100 pounds of weed.
And that old man you set up is gonna do ten years for trying to avenge his kid.
Come on, Scrap.
Don't be a sore winner.
I'll be seeing you.
I worked with your old man.
Fresh out of the academy.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Good ol' Disco Bob.
My first days were spent shotgun in your old man's patrol car.
Small world.
We, uh, we locked up this drunk kid one night.
And of course I teach him a lesson, sent him back on his ass.
Turns out he's my desk sergeant's godson.
The desk sergeant threatened to send me down to Hegewisch.
And only later did I find out that, uh, that your old man played poker with him.
Worked it all out.
You know, if you send him a bottle of something barrel aged, he'll appreciate you for it.
This sergeant I know, he's, uh, he's putting together a narcotics team, wants me to be his number two.
It's lots of surveillance, which, you know, means lots of overtime.
Put your stuff back in your locker.
Look, my last gang team, we were tight for five years.
And I thought that that's... that's where I belonged.
And I lost that.
I know how this feels.
So as far as your desk is concerned,
I was just holding it down for you.
Tell your dad hi for me.
I will.
Hey.
Hey.
Uh, Dad, I know why you called.
I'm not moving back home.
Hold on, slow down, slow down.
I didn't call you because of that.
Then what's the deal?
I've got Jason waiting for me outside.
All right, um.
I just wanted to say how much I love you.
Okay.
Uh.
You could have told me that over the phone.
I know.
Just give me a hug.
Well, look who's classing up the joint.
Brian.
What can I get for you?
Vodka tonic.
And, uh, I've got his next one.
Done.
We had this case.
Black kid, 14, was killed by this white store owner up in, uh, Rogers Park.
They got into this argument over the price of milk, and it escalated.
Store owner thought the kid was pulling a gun when the kid was going for his wallet, and he shot the kid dead.
Claimed self-defense, and he walked, this morning.
I came at you with a full head of steam.
I want to apologize.
Hey.
You know, I got two daughters...
