Attention Cloud 9 shoppers.
We do apologise for the heat in the store today.
The temperature is controlled by corporate, and we are working on it.
And though I am thankful for all of you who have taken the time to tell me that it is hot in here, the next person who does,
I'ma have to murder.
That is all.
How about you cool it with the attitude?
- Not today, Dina.

My pelvic area is like the Gulf Coast right now.
Seriously, I could steam shellfish in these khakis.
- Good God.

Whoa, keep your hands off Thor's hammer.

No, it's... no, absolutely not.
- It's mine now.

- How about it?

What about that?

Is that your own personal microphone?
Yeah.

Guys.

I know it's hot in here, but let's breathe.
Let's have some patience for one another.
Yeah, you know, the heat makes us all act irrationally, you know, I mean...
If your face stays where it is, it's gonna get punched.
- I was just saying...

God, the heat really brings out your age, doesn't it?
Dina, I am trying to keep a positive attitude today, so help me out, okay?
Yeah, sure.

So did you eat a lot of French onion soup last night, or is that just the natural scent your body secretes?
You just have a very unique musk.
It's thick.

- Okay.

- I'm walking away.

What?

Yeah, so anyway, the heat's really blasting away over here, and since you guys set the temperatures,
I was hoping you could turn it off.
No problem.

- Thank you.

Well... well, no.
Maybe your computer's not working, 'cause I can assure you it is extremely warm in the store.
Mm-hmm, yeah.

People do.
I'm just gonna put a note on here that says "manager error."
It is not an error.
I know what hot is, and I am very, very hot.
I'm sure you are.

What...
Marcus, what do you know about this pallet?
Are you asking 'cause I'm in charge of the warehouse now?
'Cause you heard I'm in charge of the warehouse now, right?
I did.

A promotion with no raise.

Thank you.

Okay.

I got a lot on my plate right now, uh, but sure, yeah, I'll take care of it.
You know what they say:
heavy is the head that wears the pants.
Okay.
It's Shakespeare.
Maybe pick up a book once in a while.
Hey, Glenn, I just wanted to check on the ETA of...
Ooh, it is pleasant as hell in here.
Well, yeah, I had to turn on the AC... in February!
Can you believe that?
I'm trying to get them to fix it, but, my God, these people!
So while everybody's out there boiling in the heat, you just sitting in here in your ivory ice tower?
I'm doing everything I can.
Are you?
'Cause your people are counting on you.
So maybe this isn't about asking for help.
Maybe this is about... 11:35?
- Keep guessing.

Okay, I can work with that.

Get out there and fix that heating system or whatever.
Yeah, I can.

Yeah.

- Okay.

Yeah, go fix it.

It's about the journey!
Ooh, max cool.
That's what I'm all about.
Ugh, can you stay on your side?
You're getting your gross guy heat all over me.
Oh, I'm sorry.

- No!

It's worse!

Oh, my God, you are such a drama queen.
You're disgusting.
I am really sorry.
I just thought leather pants would look cool.
I didn't realize they'd stick to sweaty legs.
It's fine.

It's made out of recycled soda bottles.
I'm going to this mixer for single IT guys.
Yeah?

No.

Well, they're gonna love these pants.
Uh, hey, Amy?
This woman slipped on some yogurt in Grocery, and, uh...
No!

Okay, um, I'll be right back.
Just wait here, ma'am.
Here you are.
I'm in IT.
Ooh!

Oh, shut the door.

Are you Glenn?
'Cause this is Glenn's office, but you don't look like Glenn.
Unless Glenn completely changed everything about the way he looks, or Glenn's actually always looked like Garrett but has just been wearing a mask all these years.
I'll get to the point.

Wow.

Look, I'm just taking a break from the heat.
Yeah, it is a lot cooler in here.
I mean, a gal could dry her pants out all the way in a place like this.
Marcus, a customer just slipped on the spill.
Yeah, sorry, Ames.

We're all just pretty hot back here.
Yeah, no, I get it.

But you said you'd clean it up.
Okay.

There's no need to get emotional.
Emotional?

Kind of?
Okay, you know what?

Just needs to get cleaned up.

Much apreesh.
Oh, and hey, Ames, smile.
You'll live longer.
Did you just tell me to smile?
Yeah, you little sourpuss.
Attention, employees.
Do not clean up the yogurt spill in Grocery.
This is a warehouse problem, and it will be cleaned up when they clean it up.
Go to hell, Marcus.
Excuse me.

We are aware of it!
Okay.
Have a heavenly day.
I cannot believe he told me to smile.
Yeah.

I completely agree.
Would it help if I just cleaned it up?
'Cause I really, really want to clean it up.
Like, really.
Do not touch this spill.
Okay, leaving it to fester.
You know what?

Because the... the heat.
And also, maybe the heat is causing, like, a number of us to act in ways that seem a little, I don't know, uh, overboard.
So what are you saying?
We should let Marcus off the hook because it's hot?
No.

Including me, Mateo, you.
Yeah, I know, and we're staying cool as [Bleep] cucumbers.
- Okay.

What is wrong with people today?
Whoa!
What a view!
Now I get why Brett's always trying to make me come up here and smoke out with him.
Yeah, well, this shouldn't take long.
Your job is to hand me the tools as I need them, okay?
Wow, you're so handy.
It's "handsy." Plural.
But yeah, the Sturgises have always been builders.
In fact, my ancestors built the ships that brought the very first African-Americans to this country.
You mean, like, slave ships?
No!
No.
Uh, okay, well, let's see what we're dealing with here.
Whoa!

Well, I definitely do, so why don't you just, uh, be quiet and shut up?
Do you have to make that noise?
I've got a really bad itch at the back of my throat.
You know how they say people swallow, on average, three spiders per year while you're asleep?
I think, last night, I hit my trifecta.
Ugh.
Yep, that pen still clicks.
Oh, I'm sorry.

Oh, it's not your fault.

Look, let's be adults and just not talk.
Fine with me.
You remember that time we had sex?
What the hell?

Thank you both for agreeing to sit down.
Uh, mistakes were made.
Some things were said that I'm sure both parties regret.
She told me to go to hell.

That's the worst place we can go.
Well, at least I didn't tell you to smile.
What's wrong with that?

I have an amazing smile.

But you don't tell me when to smile, Marcus.
I will smile when I damn well please.
Fine.

I just forgot how sensitive women can be.
Marcus, no.
So now I'm sensitive.
Well, how's this for sensitive, Marcus?
I am writing you up.
Uh-oh, guys.

That's...
Oh, you think that's funny?
Yeah, 'cause you were being like an uptight teacher.
What did we say about deescalating?
More like I'm your superior at a job you used to have, Marcus.
You're fired.
You're firing me?

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Let's back it up, okay?
Uh, nobody is getting fired.
And it's not "nothing," all right?
I think what happened was, maybe you said some things that tapped into kind of a gender/power matrix, so...
Ugh, seriously, dude, you're being a bigger bitch than Amy.
Marcus, you're fired.
Oh...
Okay, so... you may have heard that we had an incident.
We had to let Marcus go.
- What?

Are you allowed to fire people?
That's unclear.

I don't know.

Anyway, the rest of the warehouse walked out in solidarity with him.
Yeah.

Apparently he promised them he was ushering in a new era, so...
So we are going to unload this truck.
Do we even know how to unload a truck?
Because I came back here once when they were doing it, and it is very elaborate and choreographed.
I mean, it was poppin'.

It was like boom!

Boom, boom!

Guys, it's fine, okay?
I've got the manual, so, you know, all we need, really, are two people throwing the truck, one pushing the line, one on bulk transition, two pulling pallets, three pre-pushing HBA,
and one person bowling C and D.
Okay, so that sounds great.
Let's do that.
So, uh, what are you thinking about?
What are you doing?

I don't know.

I thought that's something that people say after...
- Oh.

Am I supposed to ask you what you're thinking about?
- No.

- Please don't.

Glenn?

I think the heat may be getting to Jonah and Amy.
They may have gone...

They've gone cray-cray.
They're both cray-cray!
Hello!
- All right, let's just go...

It could be a fake walk-away.
He's probably still listening.
Why would he do a fake walk-away?
I always do a fake-out walk-away.
Then I can hear what people are really saying about me.
And what are they saying about you?
Oh, it's never good.
It looks really complicated.
Yeah, well, everything's computerized nowadays.
But it's still the same basic guts.
Let me just try diagnostics here.
Uh... ooh, uh...
Oh, uh...
Okay, I seem to have changed the language.
Okay, guys.

I know we're all tired, but we're getting there.
We've only got, like, 200 more boxes.
Almost there.
Where's the scanner?
I've got it.

Don't worry, Sandra.

Just toss the scanner over to us.
Ow!

I can't even help my own employees when they need me the most.
That's not true.

Like how?
Oh, you want examples?
Okay, um, oh, well, we wouldn't be able to come in to work in the morning if you didn't unlock the doors.
Actually, nowadays it's all opened automatically by computers.
Okay, but who turns on the computer?
Corporate does.
Really?

Ha.

There's absolutely no reason whatsoever for me to be here.
I'm just a pathetic, useless old man, apparently descended from slave traders.
You're not that old.

57.
Holy [Bleep].
Should you be up this high?
So... sex again?
Yeah.

Okay, bend your knees this time.
Okay.

Guide you?

I know, but I can't...

Okay, well, all I see is the box in my face.
Slow down!

Ow!

Amy!

Guys, are you okay?
Stand back.

Guys, I can't break through.
Hello?
Hello!
Is anybody coming back to help me?
I know this doesn't help that much, but you can really take a fall.
You ever considered a career as a pro wrestler?
Actually, yes.
When I was a kid, I wanted to be The Ultimate Warrior.
I had the arm ribbons and everything.
I did.
Did you have the big, poufy hair?
Yes.
Breeze feels good.
Yeah.
I'm starting to feel like a normal person again.
That heat was making me insane.
Yeah.
We fired Marcus.
Like, if you could do anything, what would you do?
I've always wanted to travel.
Oh, yeah.

- Yeah?

Like, I hear that in some of the McDonald's in Asia, they serve spaghetti.
- No way!

God, I would love to see that!
Wait.
We should just go!
- Oh, what?

We should just travel the world together, you and me.
Oh, well, I mean, I...
You know, I have a baby, and then there's Bo, and I'm still finishing up school, and we haven't really spent that much time together.
No.

Yeah.
Okay, fine.

Yeah?
Sure.
Oh... oh, man.
We're gonna have to get so many shots!
Listen, I'm just saying if you put that much effort into your work...
Can we not turn this into a job review, please?
Hello?

Uh, yes, this is Glenn Sturgis.
I wear a tie with clouds on it.
Thanks for your patience.
We've finally resolved the heating issue.
Turns out, it was a problem with our computers.
It's now been fixed, and the store should already be cooling back down.
Oh, okay, great.
Hallelujah!
Well, I guess, uh, we can go back to work.
Ugh, finally.
Hey, uh, I normally wouldn't say this, but, uh, I had a good time having sex with you today.
Yeah.

- Thanks.

- Oh, no, definitely not.

Hey, you know what?

Me too.
But just... just the sex part.
I find the rest of you repulsive.
Oh, the sound of your voice makes me want to punch myself in the throat.
Yeah.
I just totally lost it.
I mean, I don't have the authority to fire Marcus.
Oh, yeah, no, we were, uh...

Ugh.

- Oof.

Marcus, who once said, "Bedsheets are for losers."
And who's, um, coming here right now.
Hey, Marcus, um, we need to talk.
Totally.

I went for a drive, I cooled down a lot... 'cause my car doesn't have doors, and I thought about today.
And I said some things about both of you that were uncalled for.
I think the heat must have gotten to me.
I'm really sorry.
Well, um, today is your lucky day, because I haven't filed the paperwork yet.
So I'm gonna let you off with a warning this time.
- That's big of you.

So we can just all come back to work.
- Sure.

- Yeah...

That's probably not gonna happen.
We'll keep it open.

- Okay.

Thank you guys.
Oh, there's that smile.
I don't know.

Should we go London, Atlantis, Hong Kong... right, it's...

And then... or London, Hong Kong, Atlantis?
- Uh, yeah.

Oh, wait a minute, Glenn.
It's cool in here again.
Wait.

You fixed it!
I did?
Oh, my God, I did.
Ha!
Oh, no!
What?
I really wanted us to travel the world together, but I-I feel like the store needs you.
- Yeah, it does.

Mm-hmm.
When you get to Macau, you buy yourself some McNoodles, kiddo.
- Okay.

Bon voyage.
Oh!

What the...
Oh, Glenn, are you okay?
Oh, do you need help?
No, I'm good.
Maybe just try to...
Maybe if you roll out of it?
Yeah, swim!

Okay.

You're not going anywhere.
