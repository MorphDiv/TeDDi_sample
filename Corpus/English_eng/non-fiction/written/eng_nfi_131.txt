Kenny:

Another afternoon rendezvous with Brett.
And I am buzzing with romance and macchiatos.
Hey, listen, I've been meaning to talk to you about something, but I didn't know how to say it without possibly freaking you out.
Oh, God.

Webbed toes?

Or worse... bisexual?

[Clears throat]
- Go ahead?

I was wondering if you wanted to go to the Sia concert with me.
That's it?
Okay, that's not the freak-out part.
Um, I was wondering if you wanted to go with me as my... boyfriend.
Yeah.
S-Sure.

And sure... to both.
I would... love to see Sia with you.
I will see ya there at Sia.
Works both ways, bu you don't, right?
[Laughs nervously]
Okay, bye.
Don't freak out.

Just a few more steps to keep your cool.

[Giggles]
[Knock on door]
Hey!

Get in here and help me with the dishes.
Oh, Kenny.

This is a ticket to a Sia concert that my boyfriend got me.
"What did you say?"
"My boyfriend!"
- Dude, I never thought it would happen.

Not because you're not awesome, but because for a desperate guy, you're pretty picky.
Okay, I really need your support right now.
I'm about to go break the boyfriend news to Mom and Dad.
They'll be fine.

I've only been gay with myself.
I've never gotten to be gay with another person.
And Mom gets upset when I even mention the thought of marrying Anderson Cooper.
Okay.

Right?

Mm.
What news could you possibly have that would eclipse me having a boyfriend?
I scored over 1,000 on my SATs.
You whaaat?

That is such great news!

Nothing could ruin this moment.
- I also have news.

I have so many questions.
What?

Shannon has been tutoring me for the past few months.
That doesn't sound like something Shannon would do out of the kindness of her heart.
It's not.
I did it because you promised Jimmy a car if he broke 1,000 on his SATs.
And one day, his car's going to be my hand-me-down.
Wait.

We did not promise to get Jimmy a car.
Hey, I feel like we're veering off course.
Maybe we could circle back to my news?
I knew you would react this way.
Jimmy:

[Eileen and Pat laughing hysterically]
Go ahead and fast-forward a little bit.
[Laughter continues]
[Both sighing "Oh"]
Pat:

Do you think it's good to have role models who break their promises?
Or who laugh at your hopes and dreams?
Pat, can I whisper-argue with you over here for a second, please?
[Whispering] What the hell was that?

I thought you had good news.
I do.

Okay, that's not good for me.
It's great for me.
All right, your mother and I have decided to uphold our promise.
You can get a new used car.
- And I'm going with you to buy it.

- You two turkeys would get swindled in a heartbeat.

Pat, your biggest flaw is that you're just too nice to people.
He is.
He's the nicest one.
He's the nicest one in our family.
Up yours!
I'm nice!
- Hey, Dad.

Wow.

Mm.

While I have ya, I have some pretty big news.
And I'm only telling you and not Mom because... you're the cool parent.
I have a boyfriend.

I hope you like him, because if you like him, then Mom will like him, and since I like him, it's important that you all like him, too.
Well, of course I'm gonna like him, Kenny.
[Laughs]
All right, buddy, your first boyfriend!
- Yeah.

Oh, wow.
Or we could... you...

♪
Test-driving cars is fun.
And she drove like a dream.
I can't wait to parallel-park her brains out.
Calm down, Jimmy.
One whiff of enthusiasm, and they know they've got you on the hook.
This is about establishing who's in charge, all right?
And if all else fails... we have this.
What?

Are we rich?

Yo, can we make it rain?

You see how you just reacted?
That's what cash does to people.

So...
We gonna get you in that car today, J-man?
Yeah!

It's just... stupid.
Mm, yeah, she's cool.
All right, well, I mean, the car has everything you want.
And, uh, this is the best I can do.
Okay.
Oh!

- This is perfect.

For me to spit my gum into.
Wha...

And we're taking our cash with us.
Come on, Jimmy.
Is that why we stopped for gum?
M-Mo...
Oh.
You have nothing to be nervous about.
My dad is very, very excited to meet you.
I'm actually more nervous abou him embarrassing me with his lame jokes.
[Bells jingle]
Hey, guys.
I should tell you...
It's so validating going to these gay places.
A guy just asked me out and gave me a scone.
That's 'cause he's got good taste.
- How you doing?

Brett, Pat O'Neal.

Ooh.

All right.
Have a seat, Brett.
Kenny has, uh, told me a lot about you.
Oh, really?
Did he tell you that I'm the cool parent?

[Laughter]
But not too cool.
[Laughs nervously]
Now, I don't want you bringin' our boy back to the homestead in the middle of the night.
You got me?
[Sighs] Here he goes.
So, what exactly are your intentions with my son?
Um... nothing out of the ordinary.
And I can promise you I will not get him pregnant, sir.
[Both laugh]
[Normal voice] Wait.

What?

He was making a joke 'cause you were doing a thing!
And we're two dudes.

- [Exhales sharply]

It really is, Pat.
I think "Mr. O'Neal" is going to be just fine.
♪
Kenny!

Hey.

Well, Steve the colorist and I are on our afternoon 15, which ended an hour ago.
We're so bad.
[Both laugh]
Both we work on commission, so it's really our loss.
[Both laugh]
I can't pay my rent.
[Laughter continues]
What are you up to, buddy?
Boyfriend drama.
You have a boyfriend?
I remember my first boyfriend.
He died.
Well, this is way worse.
Dad and Brett's first meeting...

Oh, they were probably both just nervous.
You know what brought Steve and I closer together?
An escape room.
What is that?
An escape room is a locked space filled with puzzles that you have to solve to get out.
It's a great bonding experience for a group...
Unless, of course, someone is useless.
I'm claustrophobic.
And bad with puzzles.

Mm.
Wait.

Dad is great with numbers,
Brett is great with puzzles, and I'm great with groups.
Just make sure that you don't volunteer to be the group leader.
Otherwise, somebody could strangle you out of frustration.
You found a clue, di't you?
♪
[Whispering] Clive.

Hey.
Geez, they got you working on a Saturday, huh?
Oh, yeah, just supervising detention.
Lot of these students, they're throwaway kids.
Nobody cares about them, but...

Hey!

Don't worry about what's going on out here!
Worry about where your life's going!

What can I do you for, Pat?
I need your advice, but you cannot tell Eileen.
I'm terrible at keeping secrets.
Kenny has a boyfriend, and he wanted me to meet him and not Eileen because I'm supposed to be the cooler parent, but I was not cool, Clive...

Why did you tell me that?
Now I know Kenny has a boyfriend.
What?

What are you doing?
I am texting Eileen, "Kenny has a boy..."
- You got to take the phone away from me!

I'm spinning out here, okay?
What if I don't like Brett because I just don't like the idea of seeing Kenny with a boy?
Am I a homophobe?
You are not a homophobe.
You love white wine.
[Cellphone chimes]
It's Kenny.
He wants me to come and meet up with him and Brett again.
See?

That's the key...

[Claps hands] Hey!

So help me, the last thing you see in this world will be this detention room.
And no one will care!
Scagnetti:

Do you need to go handle that?
Nah, nah.

[Door locks]
Come on, Pat.

♪
So, what kind of car did we get?
Oh!

Because after every test-drive,
Mom would break the salesman down to the brink of tears.
None of the cars fit our parameters.
And those men were weak.
What were your parameters?
Nothing crazy.
Just has to fit into our budget and have everything on that list.
A latch system for infant car seats?
You never know when a baby's gonna need a ride.
You can't get all of this for that price.
Exactly!

This is like that time that you told me that I could go to the moon for my birthday.
There is no moon!
Jimmy.
There's moon.
Look, if you feel you can negotiate those terms for my price, you're more than welcome to try it.
Here.
I trust you with this.
Like an adult.
♪
- Want me to hold that for you, buddy?

'Kay.
Aah!
[Exhales deeply] Thank you, Shannon.
[Eerie music plays]
It was a foul, dark night when old Mr. Newman found his wife dead.
You have one hour to escape the room and find the murderer before he returns for you.
- Thank you for doing this with me.

Now that I have your attention, sleuths, the teams that escape with their lives are the ones who assign a leader and work together.
This is your chance.

Show him you're respectful.

- You be the leader.

No, really, you should be the leader.
- All right, wonderful.

Let him be the leader.
Ooh!

No, you should be the leader.

What's that supposed to mean?
Like, more experienced.
Fine.

I'm actually really good at solving puzzles and stuff.
- Excellent.

I am a cop, and I have solved several puzzles myself, called crimes.
Guys, I'm auditioning for "Pippin" in like two hours, so I'm starting the clock either way, and you just figure it out.
Ooooh!
[Door slams, locks]
Hey.
So, I ran my algorithm, and unless we're willing to fly to Germany,
I can't find anything that fits Mom's criteria.
It's a fool's errand.
Well, this fool is about to go on an errand to get a car.
I met a nice man named Ranger on Craigslist who has the perfect car that fits our budget.
- [Cellphone chimes]

Ranger is waiting for me in an alley behind the Dollar Store on the South Side, and I don't want to be late.
So... give me the cash?
On one hand, I'm suspect.
On the other hand, I really hate riding on the bus.
[Clicking, whirring]
Here you go.
Wait a minute.
What's going on here?
I'd rather not talk about it.
Is that one of my Hot Wheels?
I'm onto you, Shannon.
♪
Okay, guys, as your default leader,
I am happy to report that we are close to solving our first clue.
So let's really think about what this means, okay?
"When the stars align, the Earth will turn."
I got nothing.

It seems like if we work together, we can solve this puzzle, and maybe even the larger puzzle...
Of us.
Oh, hey.

Here's the globe.
Oh, can I have the star?
Oh, you want to be the hero who puts the star in the globe?
Okay, it's the first clue.

Here you go.

Oh, let's hope so.
Just put the star in a star hole.
If they don't figure that out, it's all right.
I'm actually just about to pick this lock.
Clive, that is a painting of a lock on a fake door.
Copy that.
- Can I help you?

Okay, you know what, Dad?
- Can I speak to you over by the sconce, please?

Maybe there's a clue.

- Is the sconce real?

I cannot tell what is real.
Okay, Brett is working very hard to impress you, and you're being totally rude.
- No, I am not.

H-H-He has tried everything, and nothing has been good enough.
The only thing I can think of is that he's a boy.
At least Mom has been honest about her feelings from the beginning.
Maybe you actually aren't okay with me being with a guy.
No, Kenny, that is not it.

And I have watched too many episodes of "Dancing With the Stars" to be a homophobe.
Okay, then what is it?
I just don't like Brett!
That was real.
I can't believe you let Jimmy buy a car off of Craigslist.
You're the one who gave him the envelope full of cash.
Don't pin this on me, lady.
Oh, I gave him awful advice.
I taught him all my power moves, which is fine if you're talking to Daniel at the dealership.
But you can't spit your gum at a man named Ranger.
You spit your gum at somebody?
Am I the only one who understands the art of the deal?
You must have seen one decent car he could take to college.
Well, yes, of course.

But...
Jimmy needs a little extra protection.
And I'm just worried that out there in the world, people aren't gonna do that for him.
Maybe you're just not ready for him to leave.
Well, I'm definitely not ready for him to get mugged by a guy named Ranger.
I should have given him my rape whistle.
You have a rape whistle?
You don't?
♪
Well, the last 30 minutes of that escape room really flew by, huh?
Still not talking to you.
Kenny, come on!
[Sighing] Ay-yi-yi.
Well, thanks for coming, buddy.

Oh, hey, I'd rather fail with you than with Scagnetti.
Oh, my God.

I better skedaddle.
Plus, if I see Eileen,
I'm gonna tell her everything about today.
- [Knock on door] - [Gasps]
It's her.
It's not her.

- She wouldn't knock.

Hi, Mr. O'Neal.
[Sighs] "Mr. O'Neal." Ethan, that was my dad.
- You can call me Pat.

I have Shannon's homework.

Shannon's not home.
Do you want me to leave it?

Or should I come back another time?
Or maybe you want me to leave it on the porch.
If you have a rock...
Ethan.

I'm sorry, sir.
Now it's "sir"?

You hear this little suck-up, Clive?
This is who my daughter's dating.
I think he's being quite respectful.
Never had a child call me "sir"...
Even this one, and I'm his vice-principal.
- Can I go now?

You know, you think Brett's too casual, you think Ethan's too formal.
You just don't like kids.
That's ridiculous.

First of all, I like my kids.

I even like that Allison friend of Kenny's, and she's a real snooze fest.
- Ugh.

But none of those kids are dating your kids.
Son of a bitch.

Oh, God.

So why'd you lure my son into this alley?
Because he's having his going-away party at a hipster warehouse right there.

Oh.

Hi.
The car meets all your requirements.
Does it have a latch system for an infant car seat?
Yes, ma'am.

Eh.

You come here.

Look, here's the point...

I'm your dad.
It's my job to protect you.
So nobody is ever gonna be good enough for you.
And especially since this is your first real relationship,
I'm setting the bar even higher because I know that you deserve a great guy.
I know, but Brett is a great guy.
He's sweet and smart, and he likes my dorkiness.
He even likes my sense of humor, that I got from you.

Thank you.
Aaaaaaaaa... dorable.

I'm so sorry.
He's just a friend who's a boy that he has sexual... chemistry with.
Oh, no.

Can't tell you enough how sorry I am.

I'm sorry you had to find out that way, Mom.
Me too.
I was waiting for you to tell me.
What?
You knew this whole time?
Of course I did.

I could see it when you were singing into each other's eyes at the Christmas concert.
And...

I don't think I have a choice.
I'll take that as you're okay with it.
We can't stop you kids from growing up.
But that's not gonna stop me from looking at your baby pictures and thinking about the good old days, when I made all the decisions.
