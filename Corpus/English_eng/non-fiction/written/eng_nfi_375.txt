Last week...
Tonight, we're giving all six of you another shot.
Yes!
In a high stakes game of chicken...
He makes it look so easy.
Some fell "fowl".
While Jasmine...
You're back with a vengeance aren't you?
And Gonzalo...
Ruled the roost...
Earning their way back into the competition.
I got an apron!
Tonight...
The top 12 head to the great outdoors...
For their toughest team challenge yet...
The Scouts are here.
As they serve up the ultimate campfire cookout.
Come and get it!
Who will lead their troop to victory...
And who will get lost in the wilderness?
We are doomed.
Come on.
Announcer: 30 miles northeast of the MasterChef kitchen, the remaining 12 junior home cooks have set out on a hike deep in the Santa Clarita Mountains.
Christina, we have to go this way.
We're in pretty much the middle of nowhere.
I see tons of trees, tons of grass, and it's very dry and very hot.
Let's get to the top of this hill.
I'm used to walking around a lot, but this is insane.
Gordon, it's right there.
This way.
Gordon and Christina are getting us lost right now.
They don't seem to know where they're going at all.
Christina's map's upside down.
It's not upside down.
Leave it to the guy that doesn't want to ask for directions.
Finally, this is it.
Big round of applause for me getting you here safely.
You wish.
Right, home cooks, all of you welcome to this gorgeous
Santa Clarita valley.
This camping ground is the location of your next team challenge.
The Boy and Girl Scouts.
I'm happy I'm cooking for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts because I am a Boy Scout.
I promise to do my best, to do my duty to "MasterChef" and to obey Gordon Ramsay.
In just over an hour, 50 Scouts and troop leaders are heading here to set up camp for the night.
And to reward their grueling hike, you're all going to serve them up the ultimate camp cookout.
Yeah!
Now, today you're going to be working in two teams of six.
And today, we're picking the captains.
What?
The captain of the Blue Team is...
Peyton.
And today's team captain of the Red Team is...
Evan.
Evan and Peyton, please come up here and put your apron on.
Evan is not intimidating to me, because I've been in Girl Scouts since I was six years old.
And I have my Girl Scout cooking badge, so I think I got this.
Captains, you have another surprise coming your way.
Whoever wins the coin toss, gets first pick of their team.
Peyton, that means you get the first pick for your team.
My strategy is to pick the best chefs that I can possibly get.
The ones that know how to work as a team.
I am picking this person because they work really well under pressure...
Justise.
Right, Evan where we going?
I'm picking this person because they were a strong competitor that I know can help lead this team to victory.
Mark.
Thank you, man.
I have a lot to prove in this team challenge.
Last team challenge, I was struggling cooking the meat.
So, this is really important that I show Chef Ramsay that I am king of the grill.
The next person that I am picking is Jasmine.
Shayne.
Thank you.
Peyton, big advantage here, because effectively you're picking for both teams.
Come on up and get your red apron from team captain Evan.
Thank you.
Captains, please, join the center of your teams.
We have people that can do veg.
We have people that can do starch.
This right here is Team Awesome.
So, you're probably wondering what you have to cook today.
Not only is it a comforting, hearty protein, it's definitely a campfire-friendly... delicious bone-in pork chop.
Yes!
Overcooked pork, it's dry and a chewy mess.
Undercooked pork is downright dangerous.
Good.
Now, each guest will sample a dish from both teams, and then cast their vote for the dish they preferred.
The winning team goes directly on into the top ten of MasterChef Junior.
The losing team, unfortunately, will have to face the dreaded pressure test, after which, we have to say good-bye to two home cooks.
Okay, so, we're gonna make grilled pork chop, garlic mashed potatoes, and seared corn.
I think we should do a gravy, because mashed potatoes?
It needs a nice brown gravy.
I don't think that the gravy's the best idea.
It's too much already with the mashed potatoes.
Yeah, we're just gonna do a little drizzle, that's all.
We're not in the MasterChef kitchen anymore.
And gravy in, like, 90-degree weather?
I think it's a bad idea.
Okay, so what are we doing?
Korean barbecue.
Korean barbecue pork chops, okay?
We can do apple cabbage slaw and then potato pancakes.
Let's just make roasted potatoes.
That'll take too long, though.
The roasted potatoes are just too simple.
But you want something a bit smoother.
I'll teach you how to make potato pancakes.
I know how to.
I am super frustrated right now, because no one is listening to me.
You can't make potato pancakes with small potatoes.
You also need to peel them, which is impossible.
And it's just going to be super hard to do.
All right, everybody, "Red Team" on three.
Three, two, one, Red Team!
Go, go!
Now, two dynamic captains.
We can't let these Girls Scouts and Boy Scouts down.
You guys, quickly, come on.
Work faster.
Evan is a reserved, quiet, strong character.
Is he going to be authoritative or are these older kids kinda gonna push him around?
Right here is for hot food!
Come on, guys.
The Blue Team feels a little bit more harmonious.
They seem like they're going to work better together because they all have place for one another's voice in the Blue Team.
Right, Peyton, describe the dish for me, please.
It's an apple grilled pork chop...
You go hunting and you take a gravy with you when you're hunting?
No, Chef.
Hey, Blue Team, 95 degrees and we're serving a gravy?
We have to get our act together and we gotta hurry up.
Shayne, you are doing apple vinaigrette.
Peyton, I am not confident on doing the vinaigrette.
What's in a vinaigrette?
Yes, Chef!
It felt so good to scream with Gordon Ramsay.
Shayne the Train, hurry up.
Right, Red Team captain, give us an insight into the menu.
Korean barbecue pork chop, and we're doing a Korean slaw with it.
What else is going with it?
A potato pancake.
Avani, just give me a little handful of potatoes please, quickly.
Are you crazy?
That's what I was saying in first place, but they wouldn't listen to me.
Potato pancake out of these?
Sorry, Chef.
At least someone finally agrees with me on the potatoes.
Switch those potatoes out, okay?
I don't really need to say "I told you so", because Gordon Ramsay just did.
We need to get this going.
Just pitch your tent and we'll be right with you."
Usually, like, camping, I get hot dogs and burgers, but today I'm ready for some delicious food that you could find at a five-star restaurant.
My expectations are really high, and I am also really hungry.
I think this meal will be better than any meal you would get on a camping trip, because the camping trip meals, they have to be fast and quick so you can keep going on your hikes and your activities and stuff.
Chef, will you help me get this out?
Guys!
Come here, line up.
Justise, what did you do?
The pork chops go in the oven after you sear them, not before.
What are we doing?
We're not gonna give up, Chef.
As captain on the football team, you can't be afraid of anything.
And when you get hit, you have to get right back up.
So I know that we can get through this.
Time is ticking away and we need these pork chops done.
Red Team, Blue Team!
We need pork chops.
The Red Team is serving a Korean barbecue pork chop with roasted potatoes and purple cabbage coleslaw.
The Blue Team is serving a grilled pork chop with mashed potatoes and saut√©ed corn.
We just are waiting on pork.
I know, I know, I know.
Right as service starts, we don't have any pork chops.
Mark is all over the place.
You're just supposed to sear them in the pan, not burn them in the pan.
Unfortunately, the Red Team aren't ready.
Please pick up from the Blue Team.
These Scouts are walking right past us and getting Blue Team votes.
Remember, to vote for the Blue Team.
Evan, seven Girl and Boy Scouts just came and food was not ready.
The Red Team has burned their first batch of pork chops and are potentially losing votes.
Guys, we are in the middle of service.
I need to see some intensity in this kitchen.
The thing we need to understand is that Mark cannot do this by himself.
There is a lot on the line here for my team.
If we don't win, we have to face a pressure test and two of us will be going home.
We have to pull it together and get all these pork chops cooked perfectly.
One spoonful on top, that's all you need.
Service, please!
Whoo!
You can take any of the ones with sauce on it.
It's really good, you guys.
We need more pork chops.
Evan, we got you 30 more coming.
Make sure that pork is cooked.
Chef Ramsay is concerned about the temperature of their pork chops.
Hey, who put this pork on here?
It's on the verge of running around.
It's that close to being alive.
Who put that on there, truthfully?
Who put the pork on the plate?
All right, so you two, we can't serve Scouts raw pork, is that clear?
Man!
We seriously need to step it up and get our heads in the game.
Please enjoy, guys, and just remember to vote for the Blue Team.
Out in the dining area, the Scouts are shooting arrows at the color of the team whose entree and sides they prefer and giving Christina feedback on the dishes.
If you prefer the Red Team's dish, will you raise your hand, please?
Four for the Red Team.
If they're burnt, we're not serving them.
Oh, yeah, these are nice.
I like the corn on the Blue Team and the pork was perfectly cooked.
Vote for the Blue Team, everyone.
It adds a little more flavor to it.
I think the blue plate was better because it wasn't too burnt.
Show of hands if you prefer the Red Team's dish.
Show of hands if you prefer the Blue Team's dish.
So it's a table divided.
Last plate, Blue Team.
I'm really proud of my team.
Blue Team!
Thank you, enjoy.
That was tough, but we got it out.
Even if we don't win,
I'm happy with the product we sent out.
Win or lose, we all did amazing and we should be proud of ourselves.
Good job.
Did you enjoy your lunch?
The Red Team and the Blue Team.
"MasterChef Junior" is a tough competition.
One team will be victorious, and the other must face the dreaded pressure test back in the MasterChef kitchen.
Now, we've spoken to all of our wonderful guests.
Your voting arrows have been fired, and those votes have been counted, and we do have a winning team.
One team scored 63 percent of the votes.
The other team got 37 percent.
The winning team... is...
Red Team, Red Team, Red Team.
As a team captain, that is a great feeling to have.
Scouts, thank you so much.
Blue Team, unfortunately, that means you will face the dreaded pressure test back in the MasterChef kitchen.
I'd like the Blue Team now to go back in the kitchen and clear up.
That was crazy.
Even though we have to go up in the pressure test, we win as a team and we lose as a team.
And we're always gonna be friends.
Blue Team for life.
The Blue Team, we didn't win, but we still did an awesome job.
Now it's game day on the football field, and I'm ready for this first pressure test.
Take off your Blue Team aprons and put on the white aprons behind you.
It's time to face your first
MasterChef Junior pressure test.
And I'm sorry to say, at the end of this challenge tonight we'll be saying good-bye to two of you very talented young home cooks.
Now, you ready to find out what you're gonna all have to make?
It's an international sensation.
What?
These things are cosmopolitan.
What?
We're gonna have to cook a box?
Christina!
Tonight, you're going to have to make us a beautiful box of macaroons... delicious almond meringue cookies.
That smooth, hollow top, that ruffled bottom edge, that rich, thin center, layered between buttercream or ganache.
These little cookies might be small, but the require a huge amount of technical skill to get just right.
This chic little cookie could save you from going home.
Yes, Chef.
All of you, please, head to your stations.
This pressure test is gonna be so hard.
'Cause they know there's so many difficult elements of a macaroon and we're making the macaroons for the best pastry chef in, like, the world.
And that just adds on to the pressure right now.
As many perfect ones you can fit in that box.
The timing and baking temperature has to be spot on.
The flavor of your macaroons is entirely up to you.
Now, on your stations you all have the exact same ingredients to make your macaroons.
In the equipment room, you have everything you need to customize your macaroon.
Fruits, food colorings, spices, and chocolates.
When time is up, your box of macaroons needs to be down here on this front bench.
Everybody ready?
Oh God.
Go, go, go, go, go.
I need a pineapple.
Here are cherries, thank you.
So I decided that I'd do a yellow cookie macaroon with pi√±a colada buttercream.
But, even though I'm baking,
I can still show my Caribbean flair.
I left because I made a dessert and I just definitely have to redeem myself.
Now, macaroons, what's their dessert?
Macaroons are tricky to make.
They are an almond meringue based French classic cookie.
It starts with egg whites.
A little pinch of cream of tartar, that helps really jump-start the aeration of this meringue.
From there, you pour in a little bit of food coloring, a little bit of granulated sugar.
That mixture, it needs to be shiny, sturdy peaks.
From there, you have to take the finest little almond meal sift that together with confectioner's sugar and you fold, very gently, those dry ingredients into your meringue mixture, and then you pipe those macaroons out.
Once the piping is done, macaroons go into the oven at 325 degrees.
Because for me, the filling is just as important.
You need to nail every sector to perfect a macaroon.
So, tonight, they're up against it.
I'm doing good.
So the macaroons are gonna be a raspberry compote and buttercream frosting.
Okay, that sounds good.
I'm actually not feeling very good about this challenge because I've never had any experience with macaroons.
I've never baked them and I've never eaten them.
I'm being put up against my weakness and I'm trying to do a good job.
Yeah, but listen, we've all had issues and weak points in life but this is the most exciting thing about this journey, okay?
Now, are you a baker?
Um, not really, but I'm really excited about my favorite combination I chose tonight.
Okay, tell me about it.
Pink lemonade.
So, I'm doing a raspberry coulis and then I'm gonna do a little bit of lemon juice and a little bit of lemon zest and I'm mixing it with the buttercream.
I'm making these macaroons because in the summer me and my brother have pink lemonade stands all the time.
I love it.
Reminds me of spring and summer.
Okay, good luck.
Right, Shayne the Train, what are you doing?
I'm doing a bacon maple macaroon.
Wow.
'Cause bacon makes everything better.
Bacon macaroons?
I wanted to do something that I know nobody would do.
It's gonna be good, Chef.
How are you going to get bacon into a macaroon?
Trust me on this.
Good luck.
Now, what flavor macaroons are you making tonight?
Tonight I'm gonna make a PB  J macaroon.
I'm going to be making purple cookies and I'm going to be making a peanut butter cream cheese frosting.
So you're doing PB  J in macaroon form.
So, I'm really going to be cooking these macaroons for them, to show that I really love my family.
Christina: 35 minutes to go.
It is a blackberry black cherry macaroon and black berry buttercream frosting.
I have never made macaroons before in my life, but when I went to Paris there were people selling them at every street vendor you could possibly find and I've eaten them, so many times.
I think I can pull it off.
You can do this.
Yes.
Lila, don't forget to knock the air out of them.
No!
Lila!
Oh...
Christina: 35 minutes to go.
And do not forget, your macaroon boxes need to be down front.
Lila, don't forget to knock the air out of them.
No!
What's going on?
The whole tray fell on the ground.
Okay, let's get you a knew sheet pan, we'll get you a new mat.
Let's do this.
Come on, Lila.
Lila, Lila, focus, focus, focus, keep going.
Hot oven.
Oh, they look amazing!
Okay, okay.
I think Lila could pull it off tonight, for sure.
She is adamant about staying in this kitchen.
He's letting the stress get the best of him.
Start sandwiching your macaroons together.
These don't look very good at all.
They're overcooked.
Lila, it's better to have something in that box instead of having nothing on that box.
This isn't good.
I'm going home.
60 seconds to go.
Throw me up a macaroon, Shayne.
Gordon: 20 seconds to go.
Make sure you're 100% happy with that box, guys.
Gonzalo, take your time, be gentle.
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
Wow, what an incredible challenge.
Now, it's time to taste those macaroons.
First up, Peyton.
Let's see how you did.
Have to say, pretty good-lookin' macaroons.
Blackberry buttercream frosting and black cherry jam inside.
Now, visually, there's something moody about this, which I love.
The shades of purples and blues.
I can see that really beautiful, just ruffled foot.
You've got the smooth tops, but that tip, is the only thing that kinda takes it
I think it's time to take a bite.
Now, this delicate French macaroon should be airy, almost hollowed out at the top, two fudgy lines in the middle, and then a perfect amount of buttercream.
Pretty strong move.
I think it looks really good.
It's delicious.
You got the flavor spot-on.
It's punchy in those berry flavors.
The one thing I wish I had a little bit more of, was that jelly.
I think you did a really nice job tonight and I hope you are impressed with your performance, young lady.
Shayne, what's inside your box, please?
I made a bacon maple macaroon.
Bacon inside a macaroon, why?
I kinda wanted to bring like my Texas fusion into it.
Where's the bacon, on top, in the middle...?
A bacon macaroon is like, serving a cr√É¬®me br√É"l√©e for an appetizer.
There's no such thing.
In Texas, people would die for these.
Die eating them or die for them?
Prove me wrong.
Let's go.
Technically, they look consistent.
It's really weird because the butter center is a little bit too greasy.
It's just like raw butter.
It's sweet, super sweet, super buttery and a touch of bacon.
The color looks slightly anemic, but uniform-wise, it's precision.
Understand one thing, classics are there to be enhanced and respected, especially, our industry and at our level.
Is that clear?
Thank you.
Now, Justise, let's see how you did.
God.
I think visually your macaroons look stunning.
I love the color.
You can see those ruffled foots on the bottom of each.
You've got almost a picture perfect, flat, hollowed surface.
You hear that crunch?
Hmm.
It's a great balance.
The peanut butter is strong and bold, in all the ways that it is in a PB  J.
Lila, how difficult of a challenge was this, on a scale of one to 10?
A million.
Describe what's inside the box.
I made pink lemonade macaroons.
I did a raspberry coulis, with some lemon zest and some lemon juice.
and then I added that into the buttercream.
So, visually, beautifully colored.
It smells fragrant.
Unfortunately, that top cap should be smooth.
Also, your mixture looks rough and very matte finish.
However, it's all in the taste.
How long did you cook them for?
About 14 minutes.
What's happened there is that they're overcooked.
So, unfortunately, you've lost that chewiness, 'cause in here, that bit there, should be nice and chewy.
And, unfortunately, it's really hard.
Love the idea about the pink lemonade.
The icing, you've nailed it, but, unfortunately, they are way overcooked.
Thank you.
Don't cry about it.
You should be really proud of yourself.
Gonzalo.
All right, sir.
How'd you do?
I did bad.
I did very bad.
Okay.
What is going on in this box?
What is going on in this box?
My macaroons never rose the way I wanted them to.
I'm scared that they're undercooked.
There was not enough time to let them cool.
I wasn't able to fill up the box, so basically everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong.
I tried my best and maybe my best just wasn't enough for this one challenge.
When I was 11 I can guarantee you all I did was eat macaroons.
I definitely wasn't in the kitchen, working to perfect them in the biggest cooking competition.
So, what type of macaroon did you set out to make?
So, I decided to make a raspberry compote and buttercream frosting macaroon.
Now, how long did you bake your macaroons for?
I baked them for 14 minutes.
You have a lot of the makings for the right technique, right?
You have a nice flat top.
You can see that the ruffled foot started to happen here for you.
Let's have a bite.
The flavor of your macaroon is great.
You can taste the real almond nuttiness from the meringue.
Your raspberry buttercream is great.
You have the right amount in there for proper macaroon, but it looks like these were just a bit undermixed and could've used another minute or two in the oven.
Gonzalo, good job.
Jasmine.
Describe what's in there, please.
Today you have a pi√±a colada macaroon.
I used fresh pineapple and I pureed it with some lime zest and some lime juice.
I thought that these flavors would definitely show my Jamaican side.
They look beautiful.
Look at the sheen on these.
Wow.
The smoothness is beautiful.
Just the right ratio of filling to macaroon.
It's crispy on the outside, but delicate texture beyond belief.
You've just raised the bar for the whole competition across the board.
That was by far one of the hardest challenges we've ever asked young home cooks to do in this kitchen.
Please, come around to the front.
I am not second guessing my decision to do bacon.
No matter what happens,
I am happy with what I produced, and I'm gonna stick with it, win or lose.
Now you all know that this is a competition, to find one MasterChef.
Tonight two are going home.
If I say your name, please step forward.
Peyton.
Justise.
Jasmine.
You three are in the top 10.
Congratulations, head up to the balcony.
Get those aprons off.
I know what it feels like to go home and I really just hope that I keep on showing the judges
I deserve to stay in this competition.
Good job.
Sadly tonight, we do have to say goodbye to two of you.
Please step forward...
Gonzalo.
Please, step forward...
Lila.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm sorry, but for both of you, tonight, you've cooked for the last time inside the MasterChef kitchen.
Now, Shayne, head upstairs.
Bye, Shane.
Good job, Lila.
I'm proud of you.
Good job guys.
I'm so happy to be safe and going into the top 10.
I promise Gordon, I will not do bacon the next challenge.
It's okay.
Gonzalo, Lila, you've been so strong in this kitchen.
You're polite, you're gracious, you're ambitious.
Have you enjoyed yourselves?
Yes, Chef.
It's been a blast.
Now come and say good-bye.
Great.
But I will never forget my journey here.
This is going to Lila.
This is probably one of the best things that's ever happened to me in my whole entire life.
I said, "this has gotta be a dream."
Gonzalo.
Oh, my God.
I have represented my culture.
This opportunity has changed my life forever, and I'm definitely grateful.
Guys, make sure this is plated beautifully.
Not many people can say that they have cooked for
Gordon Ramsay and Christina Tosi.
Thank you.
Let's get it going, guys.
Congratulations, Red Team.
I've met so many amazing friends here and I will never forget all the fun times.
I'm gonna keep cooking and I still want to have a restaurant run by kids someday.
