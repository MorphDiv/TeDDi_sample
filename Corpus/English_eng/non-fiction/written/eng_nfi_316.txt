Open up!
Sorry, ray, no one's allowed in after one.
Have a good evening, my friend.
Show time.
You have the goods, you're fine.
Don't worry.
Malick.
Who?
Mate, honestly, did you have to?
I got a wine tasting later.
Where is he?
Okay, look, I don't know much.
All right.
Come on, spit it out.
So, look, okay.
As far as I know, he's staying in like some barn.
Bull shit.
Some barn, they keep horses there.
I don't know, it's his brother's and sister's thing.
But anyway, look.
Where?
Down southeast way, all right?
And that's it, all right.
You know me, making... they don't tell me too much.
You know, it's fine but, yeah.
We'll find you.
Oh, you been working out?
You're looking nice, mate.
Excuse me, sorry, I think you better get in there, mate.
Looks like they had a bit of trouble.
What happened?
Me.
Well, I must say this is a real treat.
I'm impressed.
I doubt that, somehow.
Honestly, you're really, really spoiling me.
Well I felt the need.
I've heard it all before.
Men telling me how beautiful and special I am.
But if you want to impress me,
I need less talk and more action.
Is that right?
Yeah, that's right.
But, if you what I hear about you is true, then I won't find any action anywhere else.
People talk too much.
Well, I trust my friends.
They always tell the truth.
So, just what do your friends say about me?
Why?
Looking for an ego boost?
I'm just curious.
Well, let's just say, if you want excitement, you want Ben silver.
Maybe I should cancel my credit cards.
Champagne for you, Ben.
Madam?
Tell him I'm sorry, there's been a mistake.
We didn't order champagne.
Yes, this is compliments of the gentlemen over at the bar.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
Shall I pour?
Yeah, sure.
Go ahead.
Thank you, sir.
Are you sure everything is all right?
Yes, yeah, that's my business associate.
I should probably go and thank him.
Do you mind?
No, you're right.
Go and thank him, quickly.
Ben, don't go anywhere.
Fancy meeting you here.
I can't say I'm in the mood to see you.
Is that any way to thank me for an expensive bottle of champagne?
We ordered cocktails.
This better be important.
Trust me, silver, hear me out, and you will be over the moon to see me.
All right, I'm listening.
The missing girls from the Ukraine?
What, the sex slaves?
Rumor is, they just want to get rid of them.
They've realized that people have started looking for these girls so they're selling them to the first buyer that came along.
Who in the hell was that?
Boris bishop.
Get Nigel on the phone.
Then drop everything.
Meet me in the usual place in half an hour.
Relax, mate, I've already spoken to him.
He's gathered some Brits together and he'll meet you in 15 minutes.
Thanks.
Sorry to wreck your lunch plans, mate.
That's all right, mate.
We'll just have to return the favor and wreck theirs.
You're getting slow, Ben.
Bloody hell, Nige.
What's going on?
I got tired waiting.
I've been doing some target practice.
Target practice.
You need your glasses for that, don't you?
Yeah, very funny.
Bishop sold the girls to malick.
I know where they are.
Come on.
Is the bitch dead?
Nah, she's just taking a nap.
She'll be around again soon.
Put up a bit of a struggle.
I didn't have a choice, I had to knock her out.
Huh, sorry, malick.
There's a better way to break her.
We can still sell her with the bruises.
You're the luckiest whore alive.
Today you're worth more money to me alive than dead.
Take the bitch out back.
There is man, outside door.
How many girls?
Three girls.
Including you?
Wait here.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, let's go now!
This way girls!
Follow me!
You should sharpen your reflexes, mate.
Go to this man, he's safe.
Go, go!
Sss..
I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Nice of you to join me now that the action's over, mate.
Come on, then.
It's bad manners to keep young ladies waiting.
I'm really sorry.
Spare me the bullshit, Ben.
I'm not impressed.
You'd think after everything I went through.
I went way out of my way to give you a second chance to take me to dinner.
You have the common decency to treat me like fucking lady?
Why are you covered in bruises?
Well, it's a funny story, actually.
You see, earlier on, there was...
I really want to see how you're gonna make up for this one, Ben.
Well, perhaps breakfast on the coast, in the morning.
Oh, Si, Glado breakfast, on the coast, in the morning.
How thrilling.
That makes up for everything?
Well, I'll tell you what.
Let's go to a club.
Just let me throw on a shower.
We can be out the door in five minutes.
Ben, I don't think you know how much you've pissed me off this time.
So I want this situation to be rectified right here, and right now.
Like I've said it before.
I need less talk and more action.
Hot action.
Well, I'm beginning to warm to your way of thinking.
I think you're going to need one of those energy drinks of yours?
On the contrary.
I seem to be catching my second wind.
Everything all right?
Yes, fine.
Don't ask thanks for all your help.
Ah, you may not be saying that in a minute.
Go on, Wilson, what now?
It's Miller again.
What?
Well, it seems that your rejection of his advances the other day has rattled his cage.
He came to see me today.
My god, what happened?
Let's just say he wasn't as friendly with me.
Well, did he hurt you?
No, no, well, not really, anyway.
Just pushed me about.
He's not giving up, Melinda.
He wants the Egyptian vase.
And he means business.
I was afraid of this.
He's definitely going to break in here tonight.
I'm sure of it.
I think that we need to call the police, again.
What's the point?
You know they won't do anything until a crime's committed.
Well, have you thought anymore about what your friend
Andy said about hiring this liberator bloke to help out?
In case you haven't noticed, Wilson,
I'm doing my utmost not to break the law.
Anyway, don't you think that's a bit extreme?
This is serious.
Miller means business.
He'll happily have us killed to get this vase.
You know that, don't you.
I know, I know.
No, I'll think of something.
Well, I'm bloody out of ideas.
Just in case, I'm going to take the vase home tonight.
Oh, no, no, I'll take it home.
Well, that's not going to look good if people find out about it.
It's not going to look good either way, is it.
Okay, go on.
You get out, I'll lock up.
No, I'll wait for you.
No, you just get out.
We need to get that thing out of here.
What if we're wrong?
We'll know in the morning.
Take care of yourself.
I'll be fine.
Get out of here.
Mr. Wilson.
You got a moment?
You should have done as you were told.
Sir Harry Miller doesn't like asking twice.
Please!
The vase is gone.
I don't have it.
That's not why I'm here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand what you're saying.
You disappoint me a lot.
And that's the way business is.
Sorry, sir, Mr. Darcy to see you.
Fuck.
Right in the middle of my steak.
Bad timing.
Sorry about having to cut business short.
Still, there's always a next time.
Unfortunately, not for you.
Here we are then.
All nice and cozy.
It would appear that way, wouldn't it, Harry.
You see, I was a bit like you.
Young, fresh, new to town.
Had to make my own way up.
But the one thing I always knew, was who to show my respects to.
And when.
Something I'm having to school you in, right now, Mr. Darcy.
You're not teaching me anything, Harry.
I see.
This is exactly what I mean.
Harry, I am a business man.
And if you want me to stop running things around here in this part of town, you are going to have to make me a better offer.
All right, pops.
What?
Did I say something funny?
You see, the one thing you gotta learn in this game is to have a sense of humor.
To have fun.
Wants to play.
I think we're done here, Harry.
You may think that, boy, but the reality is quite different.
You see, the reality is I'm top fucking dog here.
And any fresh shits that cause a stink in my backyard,
I inveigh a riddle and sadistic surprise.
Get off me, Harry!
You're mental!
Are you threatening me, old man?
No, not me personally.
Huh, I see.
So this is how it's gonna be, then, is it boys?
Shhh.
Enough of your childish rantings.
Shut up before I decide you're no good to me at all.
Now, your men here know who their daddy is.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Who's the daddy, yeah.
So open your eyes and see the light.
I see how this is gonna go, Harry.
I'll toe the line.
Ah, I like that.
You're a good boy.
I like it when people like you behave.
That's what I want, you see?
It makes life for me a bit easier.
Yeah?
Lynx.
How naff.
I'm more of a Cologne man, myself.
Yeah, get rid of it the lynx.
Gentlemen.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Pig.
Now, now, Miller, show me some respect.
Otherwise I won't play nice.
I'm just having a drew with my mates.
None of them who are afraid to testify to the police brutality you've just shown us.
An invasion of our privacy, eh lads?
A breach of our human rights constituted a breach of the human rights act.
Very good, Miller.
I'm very impressed with your useless knowledge.
See, it's your mates that are exactly the reason why I'm here.
I just followed one of them from knocking off an off license.
And look at the piece of shit they come to meet up with.
You bloody amateurs.
See the thing is, Miller, I don't think it would take that much convincing to make my superiors believe that you put the scum up to it.
Body bag.
Fist of fury here.
Now that's what I call good old-fashioned live entertainment.
Oh, I felt that myself.
Make it painful.
Come on, get him!
Wins, I say.
And ask for more.
Oh!
Ringside seat here.
Fist of fury.
It's you next time, Miller.
Oh yeah.
You ain't got nothing on me.
Not yet.
Time, time, time, time.
Need a lift, mate?
No, I'm waiting for a friend.
Yeah?
You're looking pretty sharp, dude, I've gotta say.
Part of the triad image or something?
No, I just like to dress this way when I'm with the right company.
Well, who's that, the president?
No, man, he's got the wrong plumbing.
Hey, baby.
Hi.
Good work out?
Not bad.
See you later, man.
Duty calls.
Hey, training tomorrow?
Yeah, man, you need the exercise.
Can I help you?
I'm here to see Mr. Miller.
It's a bit after business hours, now, isn't it?
Trust me, love, he's expecting me.
I see.
What's the name?
Viper.
Oh, baby, yeah.
Good enough yet, sweetheart?
Keep going.
You look like you're ready to burst.
You sure you don't want me to stop?
Don't you fucking stop.
Anything for you, honey bun.
Yeah, that's good, my dear.
Oh, yeah.
For god's sake, don't barge in like that!
Learn some manners and knock, you stupid bitch.
A Mr. viper here to see you, sir.
Oh, yes, I know who he is.
Let him in, thank you.
Loretta, love, can you wait outside a moment?
I just need a word with Mr. viper in private.
Anything for you, honey bunch.
Good girl.
Oh, Jean, sorry.
Women.
Yeah.
Talk to me.
What the hell's happened?
Well, to put it bluntly.
Wilson is now pig feed.
That's terrific news.
Well done, sunshine.
I mean, we gave him enough chances, didn't we?
Oh yeah, well, one chance.
Yeah, one too many.
And the most important thing on the agenda.
The vase.
Funny thing about that.
Melinda page's got a thing for valuables.
The kinky lass took it home to go to bed with.
Mmm, saucy little minx.
Well, you're gonna have to go and fetch it yourself, aren't you?
That's gonna cost you double.
How about I treble your fee?
That's very generous of you.
Do you want her dead as well?
No, restrain your natural instincts there, viper.
Keep her alive.
Besides, with her criminal past, the cops will think she nicked the vase herself.
Little bitch.
Calm down, Melinda.
Who the fuck does he think he is?
Get a grip on things, woman.
Now are we sure it was Miller?
Who the bloody hell do you think it was?
Okay, then, so go to the police.
Andrew, you know I can't do that.
He's obviously connected with Wilson's disappearance this morning, which the police are already looking into.
Throw them a life line.
For the last time, no.
I can't.
Well, then you've only one choice.
Ben.
God, things just keep getting better and better, don't they.
For fuck's sake, Melinda, why not?
'Cause I refuse to enlist the help of someone who calls himself the liberator.
For Christ's sake.
I mean, what does he think he is, a superhero?
That wasn't his idea.
That was just a nickname that stuck.
I know the guy very well.
And if it was me with my knickers in a twist, not only would he be the first person I'd trust for help, he'd be the only person.
Andrew, you've always been a good friend to me.
I mean you're the only person who gave me the benefit of the doubt when I got out of prison.
But I just don't know if he's the right thing or not.
Listen to me, I've being very serious, Melinda.
If you in any way value your career, your reputation, and your life, you need Ben silver to help.
Okay.
Check.
Mate.
Yeah?
Oh, hi Andy.
Oh, god.
Well, look, tell her not to worry.
Yeah, of course I'll meet with her.
Okay.
Yeah, thanks, Andy.
Bye.
What the hell's that all about?
A body.
Or to be more precise, half a body.
It's been found in a nearby farm.
They think it could be Marjell Wilson.
I think it's about time you started to take more interest in this girl, before she ends up as pig feed, as well.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Fresh this morning, isn't it, miss page?
Mr. Carter?
Indeed I am.
Thank god.
Andy said he contacted you and there was no guarantee you'd show up.
Andy's an old friend of mine.
I'm happy to help out anyone he holds in high regard.
If I can, that is.
Did he explain my situation to you?
Yes he did.
And I was sorry to hear about the death of your colleague.
I just can't believe it's gone this far.
I must admit, I admire your courage in not giving to Miller's blackmail.
Yeah, and look where that's got me.
I feel like Wilson's death is my fault but what was I supposed to do?
Andy did mention a certain gentleman's name that you're good friends with.
Oh really, and just who might that be?
Ben silver.
Andy always did have a big mouth.
Well, from what I hear, he's the best man for the job.
Look.
Ben's a very busy man.
Whether he agrees to help you or not will depend entirely upon his availability.
But I'll be sure to put in a good word for you.
He's been known to make special exceptions before.
Well, if he doesn't, I'm dead.
Thanks anyway, Mr. Carter.
Call me Nigel.
Tell me, Nigel.
Is he really as good as they say?
No.
Let's just put it this way.
If he can't help you, nobody can.
Well, he said he's gonna see but
I'm not certain he's going to help me.
Well I'm just gonna have to sweat it out until I hear something.
Yeah.
Well, I'll let you know the moment
I hear something.
Yeah, right.
No, I gotta go, bye.
Shit.
Tell me this isn't how you broke in the last time.
Well, no, no, no, no, I'm Ben silver.
Oh.
Just making an entrance.
You're Ben silver.
You're the one everyone's been talking about.
They failed to mention getting stuck in pat doors, there.
Yeah, well, they tend to leave that bit out.
Well, if you want to help this damsel in distress, you're gonna have to work a little harder.
Will do, don't worry.
First things first.
Would you mind?
First things first, you're gonna get a call.
Okay.
It'll be good old Nige.
Telling you I'm not going to lift a finger to help.
You're not?
Well, don't worry, you'll protest.
Of course.
But you'll accept this is the way it has to be.
Well, then I'm awfully stupid, aren't I?
You will do this, because your phone's been tapped.
Oh.
Hello, Nigel.
But you can't help.
I'm in a really desperate situation.
If there's anything you can do.
No.
I understand.
Well, thanks anyway.
Okay.
Send my regards to Ben.
Yeah, bye.
Good girl.
So you met Nigel.
Nice enough guy, right?
You gotta meet him at this address.
So, Ben silver.
You gonna get my vase back?
You gonna save the day and be my hero?
Prove it.
So, you gonna put on a show for me?
Mmm, that depends.
Have you been a good boy?
Oh, I've been a very good boy, saving it all up for you.
Mmmmm.
Oh yes.
I'm gonna be a bad boy now.
For fuck's sake.
Your door's sticking, mate.
You should have that looked at.
You've got a nerve, silver, busting in on me like this.
You're scaring little Stef, here.
She's been sent here by the department of health for therapeutic purposes.
Part of the new NHS philosophy.
Well, yeah, I mean, I've heard all about your famous boat parties.
How can I resist?
Look, why don't you relax, sit down.
Have a drink on the house, yeah?
Or best, go piss off and go ruin someone else's boat party.
Eh, sorry, mate, I can't do that.
Why don't you tell the lovely lady to leave.
It's time to take a plunge.
She ain't going nowhere.
Party spoiler.
Darling, why don't you go get some fresh air for a few minutes.
Unless you like this fellow and his bullshit.
Harry?
Do what you want.
Fuck off.
Screw you!
Now, hold up, baby, look.
I didn't know this was going to happen, did I?
I'll make it up to you, I promise, next time.
Yeah, I promise you.
You're beautiful, please.
Fuck you, Harry, fuck you.
Great, thank you.
Not bad, Harry.
I'm impressed.
Yeah, I had high expectations.
Nice to see you as rude as ever, silver.
But I think you pretty much overstayed your welcome, so why don't you just leave me alone?
Save it, Miller, I'm here for the vase.
The vase, the vase.
Why the obsession with the vase?
You're wasting you time.
There's no point to all this.
And why do you always have to be so bloody flamboyant?
Don't stall me, where is it?
Talk to me.
Talk to you?
Okay, I'll talk to you.
I don't think my mummy ever loved me.
It all started in childhood.
When she left me with a bunch of complete, utter strangers.
A motley crew of Russian hoodlums and some prostitutes.
They subjected me to history of violence.
This led to feelings of emotional inadequacy self loathing and Tourette's Syndrome.
And is no doubt the cause of the rising anger that resides deep within me today.
Well, that would explain a lot.
Hmm.
That felt good to get off my chest.
Do you know what, silver?
You're a bit like BT.
Good to talk to.
Shit.
Time's up, Miller.
You've just been cut off.
All right.
I've given the vase to Rolf.
We're leaving in the morning to escort the vase to foreign buyers overseas.
That's better.
So where is he right now?
How the fuck would I know?
What am I, his mother?
I promise you one thing.
Go after the vase and Melinda page is dead.
Yeah, well, we'll see about that.
Nice to see you again, Harry.
It's been emotional.
Well, thanks for listening.
Oh, by the way, silver, you're a dead man.
Aren't we all, Harry, aren't we all.
I'll send the lovely lady back in, shall I?
Yeah, and I'll send a bill in the post for the door.
Shit.
Here you go, my dear.
Thank you, Nigel.
It might be a good idea to let it cool down for a minute or two.
I really needed a cup of tea.
I'm so grateful for all you've done for me.
Don't be silly, it's not really me you have to thank.
I know.
I still can't believe he did it.
Well, let's put it this way.
You must be something special.
What do you mean?
Ben doesn't work just for the money.
In fact, that's the least of his concerns.
Well then what does he concern himself with?
He goes by a person's character.
He cares more about what's inside the heart rather than the wallet.
Doesn't sound like your typical soldier of fortune to me.
Well, he's not.
Surely you've found that out.
Then why does he bother with this line of work at all?
I mean, he's a war hero.
He's the youngest man ever to be awarded the Victoria cross.
Surely he doesn't need to risk his life on a daily basis.
To understand why, you have to go back to his childhood.
His childhood?
Yes.
Ben's parents were no ordinary people either.
His father was in the SAS and his mother, well, she was a world champion martial arts expert.
Wow.
Lots to live up to, I guess.
More than you realize.
You see, both of his parents were killed when he was only 15.
They were caught in crossfire trying to help a friend in south America.
My god.
Ben does what he does in honor of what they died for.
He only helps someone in real need.
I'm beginning to realize how lucky I am.
I'm sure you deserve all the help you're getting.
Tell me, Nigel.
Is Ben with, I mean, is he alone?
Well, he does have this sweet little housekeeper who comes in to give him a hand three days a week.
I don't think there's anything going on there.
She's also the same woman who helped to raise him when his parents were killed.
Let me guess, along with yourself?
I was more Ben's mentor rather than his guardian.
I owed his father that.
Interesting.
There's a lot more to Ben silver than I thought.
Would you do me a favor, my dear?
What's that?
Don't say no,
I want you to dive on the floor as fast as you can.
Don't move until I give you the word.
Excuse me?
Are you serious?
I've never been more serious in my life.
My god, are we in trouble?
Just do as I say and we'll be fine.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Now!
Nigel!
You okay?
Yeah, a bit shaken but I'm all right.
Don't worry, it's not the first time I've seen a dead body.
Brave girl.
Well, we can't stay here, it's too dangerous.
Typical.
I just had this place redecorated.
You sure he's coming here?
What am I, a complete twat?
I'm not trying to be funny but that nut is crazy enough o storm in on me,
I'm pretty sure he ain't going to worry about you, is he?
I'm surprised.
I thought nobody crosses you.
Well, don't you worry about that, sunshine.
I'll be along there shortly to teach that smug little bastard a lesson he'll never forget.
And you just make sure you're ready.
I'll be ready.
Excellent.
Now tell me about the vase.
Relax Miller, it's safe.
We'll be loading it onto the truck in an hour or so.
Then I'll be jumping on the ferry, along with the vase.
Great, Rolf, it's exactly the sort of thing
I want to hear.
Now, if that psycho does show up, do you want him alive or dead?
Kill him if you have to but to keep him alive is a 50 grand bonus for you.
You see, I want the satisfaction of pulling out his teeth and pissing down his throat, if you get what I mean.
I get the picture.
For that kind of dollar, consider it done.
Fantastic, Rolf.
You see, I knew you were the man for the job.
Yeah, smart little bastard.
Oh, shit.
Hey, fuckhead!
Better keep an eye on the cars.
Fucking imbecile.
Going somewhere, silver?
I was wondering where you were hiding.
How are you, Rolf?
It's been a while.
Hiding.
Now then.
I've been waiting for this.
You see, I knew you was gonna show up.
I just didn't know it was gonna be so soon.
Yeah, I know what you mean, mate.
Shut up!
I'm guessing it's too late to apologize for the concussion back in Rio.
Well, what's the deal, then, Rolfie?
Why haven't you killed me yet?
Haven't had the right price.
But don't worry about that, that will come soon enough.
For now, you're worth more to me alive than dead.
Is that all you've got?
Is this what I've been hiding from?
Told you, silver.
Alive, not dead.
There you go, Miller.
Two for the price of one.
Well done, Rolf, excellent work.
A 100% bonus in it for you.
Plus, I'll send the girls down later.
Thanks.
You got my details.
Oh, one more thing.
Make it painful.
Oh, I will.
Oh, I will.
I'm gonna enjoy this.
Almost dropped it.
The pizzazz.
What I hate about you, silver, is that you excel at everything.
You're Mr. perfect, born with all the trump cards in your hand.
There was always someone like you in my classroom at school.
Sorry about being late for the party.
Looks like I got here just in time.
Come on, Harry.
There must be some way we can work this out.
Oh, there's a way we can work this out, all right.
Only you ain't gonna like it.
Why do I get the feeling you're going to enjoy this?
Not entirely.
Oh, you're good, silver.
You're very good.
It's such a shame that you're batting for the wrong side.
Still, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't gonna like it just a little bit.
Hey, silver.
Silver, it's time to die.
Ben silver!
Looks like I'm just in time, too, huh?
Look who's here, Chuck bloody Norris.
Listen, get all your stuff together and get out of here.
This whole place is gonna be crawling with police any minute now.
Move it.
Don't touch the cloth.
And just remember, you owe me one.
Come on.
This ain't the end, silver.
This ain't the end.
You're hurting me!
I'm not quite there.
I really can't thank you enough.
I'm just doing my job.
Looks like you had to just a bit more than detecting to get that back.
Yeah, well, you know what they say.
No pain, no gain.
Well, it seems to me that your methods are dangerous and not all that clever.
But I'm really, really grateful.
Thank you so much for your help.
And we'll have the money wired to your account first thing tomorrow morning, all right?
I've been thinking about this, and you don't have to pay me.
You've had a real rough ride.
You keep your money and you can just owe me a favor or something.
A rough ride?
Owe you a favor?
Don't be ridiculous.
Well... oh, I see, you're taking pity on your poor, useless damsel in distress.
No.
Look, can we ever just get along?
I'm trying to do you a favor.
I almost died getting that stupid vase today.
The least you can do is show me a bit of respect.
Like I said just owe me a favor or something, that's all.
Oh, right.
Owe you a favor.
And what exactly would I owe you, Ben?
Oh, come on, don't be ridiculous.
Don't flatter yourself, love.
You don't have to get all feminist and defensive with me.
Don't call me love.
Who the fuck do you think you are?
You don't even know... you sure you're not after anything else?
Well, now that you mention it.
Something is springing to mind.
Is it time for breakfast?
You're my dessert.
I have to get to work.
Which means, you have to leave.
This is a bit unexpected.
Is it?
You knew I had work early.
Yeah, I know.
But I just thought that... why don't I stay here?
I could make us lunch.
Did I mention that, I'm a god in the kitchen.
I don't think so.
This is so random.
Don't take it the wrong way.
Last night was amazing.
Four hours, come on.
I'll call you.
You wouldn't happen to have an energy drink, would you?
No, Mr. silver, I wouldn't.
But there's green tea in the kitchen if you want it.
Sounds terrific.
Yeah.
Oh, wo, wo, slow down.
Give me specifics, what are you talking about?
Yeah.
(Car door clicks shut0
detective Stevens, what the hell's all this about?
I was in the middle of picking up my house.
It's not good.
It's pretty fucked up.
Have you managed to get a hold of silver?
He's awol at the moment, he does that from time to time.
That's not good.
What's happened?
We had to release Miller late from his cell last night.
God.
Well, couldn't you have kept him at least until this morning?
Well, that's just it.
We were building a case against him last night.
It's just the fact his lawyers work faster than us.
Let me talk to miss page.
Maybe I can persuade her to speak out and give evidence.
See, that brings me on to more bad news.
As of this morning, both Melinda page and the vase are gone.
For god's sake, can't you do anything right, Stevens?
Are you sure she's clean?
Well, of course she's clean.
In that case, she's either kidnapped, hiding or...
Yeah, or dead!
We've got to find Miller.
We need to find silver.
Hello.
Where the bloody hell have you been?
We've been trying to reach you for two hours.
Nige, if you're trying to reach me, why don't you just try my mobile?
'Cause you're bloody battery's dead.
Now listen up?
This is very serious.
I don't care how serious it is, mate,
I'm so tired right now, I just need to hit the sack.
I've had a hell of a week.
Whatever it is, let's just deal with it tomorrow, yeah?
Listen to me, Ben.
We've got to roll now.
Okay, fine, I trust you.
But let me tell you something, man.
This better be worth it.
Come on.
Come on!
Vile.
You really are a lucky guy, man.
What the fuck are you doing here?
We had training, remember?
Thank god you're punctual.
It's about fucking time.
Christ, Ben, you look like shit.
Come through good.
Nice timing.
But we need your help.
Yeah, no shit.
I just saved his life.
What the hell happened to you, anyway?
I got involved with Melinda page.
I told you we didn't need this case, nige.
Someone just tried to kill me, and nearly succeeded.
Now what the fuck is going on?
It's Miller.
He's free.
How could you let him go?
Listen, without the vase, we had nothing to hold him on.
All the evidence was circumstantial.
My boss says we'll be lucky if he doesn't fucking sue us!
Well, listen, he just had someone try and take me out.
And you can bet your ass, he going to go for that vase.
Melinda.
She's disappeared.
We've got to help her.
He's not gonna let that girl live.
Yeah, but how?
She could be anywhere.
I think I know where she is.
Lambert's factory.
Who the hell is Lambert?
David Lambert, one of Miller's business associates.
And a pain in my ass!
Let's go.
Listen, he's also as tough as they come.
He'll probably have an entourage of killers just waiting for all of us.
The point being?
It sounds like fun.
Listen, this isn't going to work.
Let me make a call.
Maybe I can get a sting operation set up.
In two hours... no, no, she hasn't got two hours.
Come on, let's go.
Wait!
Listen, if you're intent on doing this, you're gonna need my help.
I have to hand it to you, Miller.
This foreign buyer would never pay the full price for the vase, and you know it.
You know, I like you, Lambert.
It's always fun doing business with you.
Just like the old days.
Just like the old days.
By the way, I like your motor.
It comes with the suit.
And remember, it's Lambert?
Of course, like the cheese.
Do forgive me, my French is normally excellent but occasionally slips.
And now, this guy silver.
Is he gonna give us any problem?
I wouldn't worry about silver.
If that crazy son of a bitch is stupid enough to come back again, he'll only get his ass kicked twice.
Yeah, don't you worry about him.
Hopefully my man viper's separating him from his meat and two veg as we speak now, Lambert.
Well, for our sake, I hope so.
And this girl you brought here.
You cannot leave her here, you know that.
Oh yeah, the bitch.
I tell you what.
I like them a bit feisty.
I might take her home with me.
Have some fun and games with her, yeah?
Depends how bad your men fuck her up first, I suppose.
I can always tell them to let her be.
No, no, let your men have their fun with her, as long as they don't kill her.
That posh little whore deserves to suffer.
Miller, you're sick.
Yeah, I know.
Looks like there's no one around.
That's a good thing or a bad thing.
Yeah.
So, what's the plan, then, silver?
Simple.
There isn't one.
Ben, you never change.
Nige, you better wait outside just in case something goes wrong.
And guys, why don't you come with me, and we'll split up inside.
Sound good?
Love it.
I'll give you 15 minutes, then I'm coming in.
You can make it 10 if you like, mate.
Look, Ben, you watch it in there, okay?
I'll try.
Finally.
Take me to Miller, I want to speak to that sick bastard.
Hello?
Well, don't worry, I'm not going anywhere, am I?
Oh, no you don't.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
But I'm not you, am I?
Get off!
You know, guys like you really make my job worthwhile.
Shhh.
Sorry, I'm late.
I'm just pleased to see you.
You okay?
Yeah.
Come on.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Wait.
Hey!
Come on, it's this way.
You can't go this way.
You gotta go back.
Shit, come on, quick.
This place is huge.
Silver!
You're supposed to be bloody dead!
We got the vase, let's go.
Time for my foot massage.
Miller!
Wait.
Yah!
Yah!
Stevens, I presume?
Lambert.
Finally we meet.
You're under arrest.
You really stitched me up on this one, Miller.
That's what you want?
The vase?
You know, in France we have one phrase.
We say, if you want something to badly, we fight for it.
The fight you want?
Come and get me.
Lambert?
Oh, god.
Yeah.
Nice style.
Thanks.
Oh, come on, I had that shit covered.
Yeah, right.
Come on, let's get you out of here.
Wait, you better go and help Stevens because I fucking can't.
Bonjour.
You're not going anywhere, Lambert.
You should have stayed down.
It's too bad, son.
You know, I know a really nice bar nearby.
Champagne?
I think I need it.
Ben fucking silver.
I've got the perfect bar for you.
Get out of here.
I'll meet you outside.
No, I'm not leaving you.
Get out of here now.
Go!
Come on, Rolf.
You're a barrel of laughs, Lambert.
Let's go.
I'm not going yet.
Come on.
There's nothing you can do.
See, that's what you think.
You stay down, Lambert.
Shit!
What's the rush, Harry?
Hot date?
Fuck's sake.
Back seat drivers.
Have I been a naughty boy again?
That's for Wilson.
Yes, and don't forget about my house and that is for Nigel's house.
No sex for me tonight, then.
Come on, Nigel, let's go.
Oh, you go on, I'll keep an eye on Harry.
And no future prospect of children, either.
Easy now.
Silver.
Come on, Rolf.
I'm not gonna kill you today, Rolf.
You're a great warrior.
You used to be a great man.
But next time, if I have to, I will finish the job.
I just hope that next time we won't be fighting
but getting drunk instead.
Nice one, silver.
Rolf.
No, no, leave it.
It's cool, man.
You know, on second thought, you can transfer the money into my account first thing in the morning.
