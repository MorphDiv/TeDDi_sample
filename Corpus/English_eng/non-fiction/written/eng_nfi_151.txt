I think we explored 10-X.
- No.

Why do you guys keep handing on to this?
Because I believe.
Let's put this machine in there.
Yeah.

I still am puzzled by what's in the bottom of 10-X.
I still see the square target.
I think it's still in the same position.
John Chatterton is back.
Hopefully, he can put his eyes on the target.
He's got something on the metal detector.
There is an island in the North Atlantic where people have been looking for an incredible treasure for more than 200 years.
So far, they have found bits of gold chain, a stone slab with strange symbols carved into it, even a 17th century Spanish coin.
To date, six men have died trying to solve the mystery.
And, according to legend, one more will have to die, before the treasure can be found.
For brothers Rick and Marty Lagina, this summer has proven to be one of the most productive in the 221 year search for treasure on Oak Island.
In addition to already uncovering a number of important clues...
That's the hatch!
It's a large board.
They have made significant finds in the swamp...
It may be a ship's plank.
And on property once owned by former American slave, Samuel Ball.
I think this is an encampment.
This is quite a haul.

1700s.

But what is perhaps their most challenging, and potentially rewarding discovery lies ahead:
The exploration of borehole C-1 by world-renown diver,
John Chatterton.
We entered a swimmable cavity that may extend into the original money pit.
Your question is, "Are we interested?"
That is our question.
We prefer you didn't have that great success without us.
It was at C-1 where, last year,
Rick Lagina and Oak Island historian, Charles Barkhouse, drilled a six-inch wide exploratory borehole in an effort to pinpoint the exact location of the original Money Pit.
In addition to discovering what appeared to be a 21 foot tall void some 171 feet deep below the surface of the island...
Here we go.
They also came upon what appeared to be a shiny metallic object, possibly man-made.
- What's that?

Yeah, it looks metallic.
Look how yellow that is.
It's your gold color, David.
All right.

But today, while Rick, Marty, and the team await John Chatterton's arrival, they have arranged to meet once again with underwater imaging expert, Brian Abbott.
- Brian!

- How we doing?

Yeah, same here.
He has been invited back to the island to collect additional sonar scanning data at the bottom of borehole 10-X.
Baby!

Here we go.
One year ago, after conducting a previous sonar scan of 10-X,
Brian Abbott made a stunning report.
There's a structure down there.
It's roughly two and a half feet by two feet.
What we think this box could be is a possible chest.
Wait.

90%.
But when John Chatterton made his daring inspection of 10-X last summer... he contradicted Brian Abbott's findings.
Right about here, I had a rock that I would estimate was ten inches to twelve inches.
It was very angular, had at least one 90 degree angle on it.
I picked it up.

It was, it was heavy.
To me, that was what gave you the sonar's signal of the box.
We know that John Chatterton went down in that chamber.
- Yes.

- Yep.

It fits perfectly with the sonar, right?
- Correct.

- All right.

He did find the objects.
He did eliminate them as man-made.
So, this is, this is huge data right here.
For Marty, not so much for me.
In my mind, my brother has to come my way a little bit.
Really, it's my brother's agenda.
He's of the belief that the sonar can prove that the box is really a rock.
I have some...

Anyway, let's put this machine in there.
Yeah, let's get it in hole.
In order to insure that the data he collects remains consistent with his previous efforts,
Brian will be working with the same MS 1000 scanning sonar device he used last year.
- Going down.

By sending out sonic pulses that record the distances between the device and any objects around it,
Brian will once again be able to create a three dimensional picture of the underground cavern.
Okay, let's hold it there for a few minutes.
- You got it.

For Rick Lagina and the Blankenships, the data being collected from 10-X is critically important.
If the object that Brian Abbott and Dan Blankenship first identified as a possible treasure chest, turns out to be the same square-shaped rock that John Chatterton located, and then moved, during his dive last year, then any further exploration of 10-X would be unlikely.
We'll go ahead and lower it a few more feet.
But if the sonar records evidence of both the rock and what appeared to be a chest, then the Laginas and their partners may be closer to solving the Oak Island mystery than they imagined.
So, Brian what are you seeing?
I'm seeing a lot of the same structure of the cavern down there that I've seen before.
- I like the word same.

I still see the square target in this area.
I think it's still in the same position.
Really?
At this point, Brian has sufficient data to compare the subterranean cavity's current condition, and last year's, and then a definitive, declarative statement can be made, either yay or nay.
Thumbs up, thumbs down.
How much of a definite statement can you make in terms of comparison?
Comparing it old to new data, I can overlap them, do measurement tools, all that type of stuff to see things have moved or have not moved down there.
I think I can be fairly accurate with that.
All right, let's get packed up and let's-let's get you to where you can get us what, you know,
- the answers we need.

As the shadows of another evening begin to cover Oak Island...
Okay, Brian, this is what we've been waiting for.
Rick, Marty and their partners gather inside the War Room.
So what I've got is some screen shots of kind of before John Chatterton went into that cavern to identify things.
I got a shot of after what we did today to show possibly some differences, and so forth,
- that have taken place so.

Let me pull this up.
Okay, this is from a year and a half ago.
We really went in and did a detailed analysis of the cavern.
If we look at this most recent scan of 10-X, this is the same location, same depth through the six-inch pipe.
So we're able to come in there, look at this,
I looked at the features and as far as I can tell right now, the walls, what we interpret as to be tunnel openings and everything, it looks pretty much all the same.
So I believe that the sonar is giving you good interpretation of what's there.
Here's the box we've seen in 2014.
All I can say for right now, I did not see it in the data that we collected on this most recent scan.
- It's gone.

This target that we had.
So, John Chatterton said he moved a rock.
- Correct.

So that's pretty much what I have, guys.
Okay, Brian.

- All right guys, thanks.

- I appreciate it.

- I appreciate it.

Yeah, have a good night.
In a sense, that's the data I wanted to hear, 'cause that's what I thought happened, but on the other, I'm disappointed.
I don't want to do anything more in 10-X, then.
I mean, how much proving do you have to do?
Well, I'm not where you are.

Neither am I.
Ming up... anym.
But that's kind of where I'm at.
I mean, I think, I think we explored 10-X.
- No, no.

Hear me out.

I don't want to be the dog in the manger, okay?
But I also don't want to be stupid.
For Rick Lagina, the strong belief that something incredible lies at the bottom of 10-X has found him at odds with his brother, Marty.
I'd like to do an excavation where the data points.
I told you a long time ago,
I don't want to walk away with regrets.
Yeah, I know that.

It is a situation that doesn't happen often, but when it does it poses a threat to the entire Oak Island partnership.
Dan's focus throughout much of his 50-plus years on Oak Island was the belief in 10-X.
You know, when you dedicate your life, 50-plus years, to one singular goal and nothing else, he wants answers.
I would like to continue costing out some process by which we can get down to the bottom of 10-X.
Okay.

So I'd like to follow up on that.
It's not going to cost us any money.
We quote it out, and take a look at it.
Well, that's where I'm at, I'm just telling you.
You can, you can make a face if you want to, but that's where I'm at.
I can't help it.
I tend not to give up.

To paraphrase Johnnie Cochran, O.J.'s attorney, if the box is gone, we must move on.
And that's how I feel.

But, I respectfully disagree.
Why do you guys keep hanging on to this thing?
Because I believe.
- David?

I believe there's something there, too.
Why though, David?
Just to prove one way or the other, Marty.
Whether Dad was right, or he was wrong.
And I, I promised my mother that we'd try and finish it.
And I'd like to try and keep that promise.
All right.

There's a heavy-duty emotional component to 10-X, on a variety of levels.

Is it possible that what Dan saw is now all covered in silt?
Because I believe what Dan saw is there.
- What's all this about?

That came out of 10-X.

What more do you want, Marty?
Chain, wire, and that low carbon steel, all tested out as being made prior to 1750.
All of that came from the bottom of the damn hole.
- All of those things?

Marty's got an "X" in it.

I'm real close to an X.
I mean, if we could do something fairly cheap to clean up the bottom,
I'd be all for that.
I'm just concerned it's not an easy thing to do.
I don't know, I'm afraid you guys are never gonna be satisfied until you crawl down that hole.
- Truth is...

- You're right.

There you go.
I still am puzzled by what's in the bottom of 10-X.
Look, I'd be happy, if I could come around to putting an X through 10-X,
I'm good with that.

I'm still enthused about the Money Pit, but I think it's time to attack where it started and... see what happens.
I have no problem with that.
Okay, then, I say we call it a day.
- Let's go.

As a new day begins on Oak Island, the team's focus shifts back to this year's key target:
The Money Pit.
In order to determine if the void at the bottom of the C-1 shaft is large enough, and stable enough, to accommodate a diver,
Rick, Marty and the team have invited John Chatterton along with dive supervisor, Howard Ehrenberg, to observe their scanning sonar operation.
We're all very grateful that you've come back after all this time.
Hey, you know, for us this is another opportunity to contribute something, so we're excited.
You've got your work cut out for you.
Yeah.
So here we are, I see Blaine's here with the gear and everything's set up ready to go.
To scan C-1, Rick and the team have invited sonar experts Blaine Carr and Evan Downie to Oak Island to utilize a relatively new and cutting-edge scanning technology known as BlueView.
Hey, Howard.

- Morning, guys!

Unlike the previous scanning sonar devices used on the island, the BlueView device is designed to pan and tilt while it scans.
This will allow it to gather higher resolution images of underwater structures and the objects contained within them.
- Okay.

- Yep.

Make sure she's not befouled of the cable, and... yep.
I wonder if we put a board across, and lower this off of a board.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
So, this drops all the way down to the bottom, and sits on the tripod?
Yep.

A little bit of overkill, but...
No.

No, no such thing.
All right, ready?

They're gonna connect this survey of down hole in C-1 and hopefully, they'll give us a real proper assessment of the size of the cavity.
We're in the water.
And put John and Howard at ease, for the dive to proceed.
It's 100 feet coming up.
160.
It's recording some data.
Now this is 185.
We're well into the cavity, right now.
- Blaine, are we ready to go?

Now that the sonar device is sitting on the bottom of the C-1 shaft, some 190 feet underground,
Blaine Carr can now begin taking scans in order to build a complete picture of the mysterious void.
Okay, we got a five minute scan, and everything seems to be good so far.
What have we here?
That looks like there's a shaft pointing into this.
You've definitely got something.
NAWhat have we her p...
That looks like there's a shaft pointing into this from off at an angle.
So this is not the shaft that we dropped it down.
Not knowing exactly how our unit is sitting on the bottom right now.
It could be on an angle?
It could be the shaft that we just came down, and it's sitting inside a cavity right now, looking back at the shaft.
This looks pretty well rounded out.
At the Oak Island Money Pit, sonar expert Blaine Carr, is obtaining BlueView scanning sonar data of the void at the bottom of the C-1 shaft.
He is trying to determine if the void is stable enough to allow for professional diver,
John Chatterton to enter and explore.
Could this be the, where, the tunnel that we came down?

- Yep.

- We just came down.

It's way wider.
If we came down this shaft, it's definitely wider.
There's definitely a cavity.
But you... you've also got...
Remember this is 360 degree scan, so it's not seeing what's out on either side here.
It's showing what looks like an opening here, that looks like it went this way, underneath.
So you got your shaft, you got an opening, and it looks like there's an opening going right through it.
- Yeah.

So you got yourself a void, and you've got something leading off your void.
A second opening?
Could the sonar scans have revealed the existence of a possible man-made tunnel, more than 170 feet below ground?
If so, who built it, and, perhaps more importantly, where does it lead?
It's like from me to as far away again as I am on the other side of that tunnel.
It's more than four feet wide.
Sonar is indicating a larger space, and in fact, it's indicating the possibility of a void slash tunnel, coming into the space, so it's very intriguing, but we've got further work to do.
So this is just the second scan, this isn't merged with the other scan yet?
No, No.

You can't do that here in real-time.

So, what you're looking at here,
- see where the mouse cursor is?

That's basically the position of the sonar.
So, at the point at which you compiled all these data sets, and then it computer models, at that point, you'll be able to give John and Howard a very good idea of height, width, and breadth of the cavity.
Give me three or four hours.

I'll do my very best to get it all into one cohesive package and... present it tonight, and you guys can come up with a plan.
Look, Blaine, again, Thank you very much, and look forward to what you've come up with.
- Great.

We'll see you later.
You know, we've had a lot of meetings in the War Room.
But this one in particular I think is most welcome.
At the end of another long day on Oak Island,
Rick Lagina and members of the team gather in the War Room to find out the results of the BlueView sonar scans.
Blaine.

Yeah.

The first one here is actually a screen capture, and what we're looking at, the perspective we have right now is looking down the hole.
The sonar allowed it to see this opening cavity outside of your caisson.
Our measurement on it, conservatively,
I would say it's about ten feet back from the center of the caisson.
So you're saying, ten feet, pretty confident.
I'm pretty confident on the ten feet.
I mean, as you can see from the image looking straight down what looks to be a corridor.
A corridor?
Is it possible that it was through this passageway that objects of great value were carried to their final hiding place, centuries ago?
So, now let's just move on to the next slide here.
Did you collect enough information to tell whether or not the tunnel was perfectly perpendicular to the hole we dug?
What of the hole I can see, I can say, yes.
- Really?

I can...

I don't think I can see the end of that hole.
I think that hole carries on.
This could lead to a whole other tunnel system that we've proposed could be under Oak Island or possibly a separate treasure chamber.

This could just be the beginning.
Absolutely.
We're covering a lot of ground here.
Your best guess on dimensions of that chamber at the bottom of the caisson.
So we're going to get a measurement from what I think is the base of your opening before the hammer drill, so the shoulder is what I've been calling it, the shoulder of the ceiling.
I'm going to say between six and half to eight and half feet, saying plus or minus two feet at this point, because of all things considered I think is a pretty fair game.
You know, I mean, we're-we're-we're asking him to measure with a micrometer, mark it with chalk, and then cut it with an axe.
But at the same time, you tell me, if I'm not synthesizing this correctly, basically it's about seven foot high, and ten by ten.
Yeah, I think that's accurate.
That's a pretty good space.
I mean, it's definitely, it's definitely big enough to stack some stuff in there, if this is what it is.
We would want all the information possible;
There's nothing like eyes, boots, and hands on the ground, in that cavity.
So, I'm excited.

As soon as the boots hit the bottom, pretty much for the rest of the day, that's it.
So our best visibility is going to be first thing in the morning.
I think we've got a real clear idea of what we want to do from a diving standpoint tomorrow.
We're all on the same page?
- Absolutely.

Okay.

Everybody gets some rest.
Agreed!
N It is the beginning.
Of what could be one of the most important days in the 221-year search for treasure on Oak Island.
At the end of the day today, for me,
I hope we get answers.
That's our job, Howard.
- That is your job.

- There's your goal.

Let's get some answers.
What are you guys all walking around in t-shirts like it's summer time?

We ain't from Florida!
Today, renowned diver, John Chatterton, will attempt to dive more than 170 feet to the bottom of the C-1 shaft.
If successful, he will also try to locate, and possibly recover, the mysterious gold-colored object the team saw while drilling there last year.
Look, at the end, at the end of this dive I'm hoping we'll all be completely enthralled by what we see.
- Yeah.

- That's my hope.

No, the most important thing we can bring back is you.
That's first and foremost.
You come, you go down the hole.

Or a handful of gold coins would be pretty close.
Him first.

The team will be making their initial descent into the 40 inch wide shaft by means of a bosun's chair.
It will be lowered down C-1 by a boom crane, and will not only allow the divers safe entry and exit, but will also enable them to remain suspended above the clay that lies at the bottom of the void.
The focus for getting the video is we want to minimize the disturbance in the water, minimize kicking up any silt.
We want to make sure that the overall integrity of that rock is safe for divers to be down there.
- All right, let's do it.

Okay.
Now pull forward, just turn it hard left.
Where are the zip-ties, Nick?
We're going to have to cover that in electrical tape.
This is the only time I want to come over here today.
Although the team has arranged for emergency medical technicians to be on site at all times during the dive operation, they have also taken the extra precaution of obtaining a decompression chamber, as the divers will be at risk
for possible decompression sickness, also known as "the bends," a condition that happens when a diver's bloodstream becomes filled with nitrogen bubbles, caused by ascending to the surface too quickly.
The results can be extremely painful, and may even be fatal.
Hopefully, you're gonna have nothing to do all day.
I hope so.
Now, I got enough to run two and half treatments, so I got lots of extra gas.
Okay, so we don't have to ever come over here today?
- No.

All right.

Is he going to sit in the chair the whole time?
Yeah.

As John Chatterton begins final preparations for his momentous dive into the C-1 shaft...
- Hey guys!

He is greeted by Marty Lagina and Craig Tester.
They will be monitoring the dive operation live from their offices in Traverse City, Michigan.
Last night, we hammered out a dive plan that looks really solid, and...
Okay, John, now, I don't want to tell you how to dive, but if you see a shiny gold thing would you please pick it up?
If you look in John's resume, you know, what he's done, the, the technically difficult dives he's engaged with, he's committed.
He's ready to go.
Comm check John.
Where's my umbilical?
John will be descending into C-1 with attached umbilical cables.
These will not only supply a mixture of nitrogen, helium and oxygen into his suit, but also hot water which will help to keep him warm in the shaft's frigid 40-degree temperature.
What's your temperature at?
95 and still climbing.
Send him up.
In the communications center, dive supervisor.
Howard Ehrenberg will maintain constant contact with John during the dive.
The team will also be able to see what he sees on the live video feed from his dive helmet.
Going down.
- A little tight.

There's no extra room in there, that's for sure.
No.

All stop.
Okay.

Copy that, John.

The visibility looks pretty good.
I can see your hands nicely.
Visibility still good?
We're seeing his glove, his dive computer;
We're seeing the walls of the caisson.
It's all looking good, at that point.
We've got clarity;
He can actually put his eyes on the target.
Looks like it's getting a little mucky down there, John.
- All stop.

All stop.

John, how's the visibility now?
- Yes.

Copy that.
Copy that.

At the Oak Island Money Pit, diver John Chatterton has successfully made his descent down the C-1 shaft and is now exploring the mysterious void located more than 170 feet underground.
All stop.
What are you seeing?
Structurally it's good.
That's excellent.

Yeah.

Copy that.

All stop.
What's the problem?
Can you see anything?
That's bad visibility.

Yeah.
It's going to be a go by feel, a tactile dive, and he's feeling his way, 160 plus feet underwater.
That's a significant undertaking.
Get in and get out with whatever information you can.
What's going on, John?
So what does the bottom feel like?
Soft clay.
Can you ask him, can he feel any water flow?
So, is there any indication of water flow down there?
Copy that.

Do they feel irregular?
Copy that.
How are you doing, John?
It's been like 25 minutes.
Copy that.
Okay, so I'm sure you heard.

Okay.
Okay, so we're going to bring him up to 70 feet, right now.
With his first dive into C-1 completed,
John Chatterton begins the slow and gradual process of ascending to the surface.
How's your rate of ascent?

Although he was only able to spend about 25 minutes exploring the bottom of C-1, the time it will take him to reach the surface, and for his body to safely decompress, will be almost twice as long.
But when he resurfaces, what will he report?
Could he have found evidence of the shiny, metallic object that Rick,
Dave and Charles spotted last year?
Everybody here believes in that shiny gold thing.
I believe that the shiny gold thing perhaps opens the chapter.
The Oak Island Mystery.
I think there's a wonderful story written here.
Maybe... maybe today, we open the first page.
I've got good news and bad news.
The bad news is the visibility is terrible.
The good news is there's another hole.
You know, if this diameter is 40 inches, it's like, maybe 37, or something like that.
- You're talkin' tunnel?

John's confirmation that some kind of passageway exists in the void at the bottom of C-1 offers exciting news for the Oak Island team.
But is it a natural formation?
Or could it have been man-made?
In your opinion, I mean you've seen rock underwater,
I mean, you'd think the walls would be smooth, and you're saying they're rough.
Absolutely, not smooth.
Here you could see the rough, overhead of the ceiling, and it's solid, it's not all falling apart.
It's not rotten rock, and there are sharp edges, and all that kind of stuff, but it's not something where I'm concerned that the whole thing is going to, like, cave in.
The walls in C-1 did not have the smooth feel but sort of a chipped like texture, which is some indication of being man-made.
Could it really be a man-made chamber?
I mean, that's your first thought.
Could it be carved out?
Are you comfortable at this point exploring the cavity?
I don't see anything from an integrity standpoint that concerns me.
It begs the next question, you know, a follow up dive.
- Yeah.

Well, we could metal detect on the bottom.
Perfect.

Although the team is eager for John Chatterton to attempt a second dive, for safety's sake, he will need to wait for an extended period so that his body can completely stabilize.
Luckily, expert diver, Mike Huntley, is on hand to make the second dive.
But this time, the emphasis will be on trying to locate the mysterious metallic object.
Now, he'll go back down, metal detect, okay?
- Okay.

Could Mike Huntley be just minutes away from locating... and possibly recovering, what appeared to be a gold-colored object discovered at the bottom of the C-1 shaft?
Copy that.

How's that?
As the sun threatens to end another day of treasure hunting...
Copy that.
Brothers Rick and Marty Lagina anxiously monitor the progress of diver Mike Huntley as he slowly makes his way down the C-1 shaft, more than 170 feet deep below the surface of Oak Island.
Copy that.

Armed with an underwater metal detector,
Mike will begin searching for the mysterious gold-colored object the team recorded video footage of last year.
Copy that.

So you can't see anything, right?
Is it totally silted out in there?
Copy that.
Find the shiny gold thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.

He's got something on the metal detector.
He's getting metal detector hits, and that's a game changer if it could be verified.
There should be no metal in a solution feature.
That would pretty much say, this is man-made.
Is he certain of that?
It's not your gears setting off the metal detector, right?
Because Mike's helmet is completely made of stainless steel, he must be certain that his metal detector is not getting false readings.
- Is he in the rubble pile?

You might try zeroing in on the object, shutting off the metal detector, and then just reaching toward the middle and grabbing at it.
A block?
Could Mike Huntley really have found a large, metallic object located at the bottom of the mysterious void?
It's not on the surface of the wall.
It could be back in it.
Can he get even a sliver of it?
All stop.
Up on slack.
Though we don't have orientation nor scale on the camera that we put down last year where we see this object, it appeared to everyone that it was either in the ceiling or the wall.
So, are we on that?
Is it possible that Mike Huntley has located the strange gold-colored object that the team obtained video evidence of last year?
And, if so, could Rick, Marty and their team be just moments away from finding an important piece to a puzzle that treasure-hunters have been searching for, and dying for, for more than two centuries?
You've piqued everyone's interest, right now.
There's another one right there.
Two feet away from the other one.
Next time on The Curse of Oak Island...
We have financial constraints at this point.
We need to make a decision today.
This is a Mi'kmaq relic.
The face is pointing at Oak Island.
What's that?
We have hits, in the cavity in the Money Pit.
It doesn't get any better than that.
How many hits has he, does he have?
- Three hits?
