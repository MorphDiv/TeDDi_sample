Henri Duflot knew that war is not possible without information.
And that without the possibility of the war... there is no peace.
If there was between these walls an exemplary man, a thoughtful man...
It was him.
To the end her loyalty has not been tainted.
To the end... your sense of your mission trusted by this house... has taken precedence over everything.
In this courtyard and in our offices his mission covers him with glory.
Out of these walls is the banal story... of an official close to to retire whose heart failed.
Outside these walls... for the rest of the world... for you, lady... and for his son, his great joy...
Henri Duflot has gone in the shade.
Shadow is our domain, our friend... both in victory and in defeat.
Henri Duflot knew it and was subject to the law of service.
Let's keep a minute of silence.
Our silence minute is over.
Around the world, in the embassies, under tents... with a great cold or in full heat... has been respected by the people of the house... as Henri Duflot liked to call her...
Everything okay?
Will be put at your disposal a book of condolences... so they can write their messages.
The funeral will take place the week that comes in the familiar intimacy.
I thank you.
I have read your report.
Then Henri asked Cochise to remove Malotru?
If I remember correctly, we said: "Do not mix it up."
"The two operations do not have anything to do."
Crisis room.
It's what Henri had in mind when he volunteered.
Release Malotru.
His bond with Malotru affected his judgment.
"Henri will always be to me a model of exigency."
"My sincere respect for the most loyal man of this house... who knew how to be discreet in spite of the greatness of the missions..."
Hard to admit, but did not get along with Henri.
The brute, the man of action, was me.
And the wise man, the one who thought about it, he.
Shit.
It has happened on the ground.
During an operation I prepared here with him.
Badly prepared, surely.
Not well enough prepared.
He always sat there.
It was his place.
We did not understand each other, but I knew that it had to be kept.
And if an analyst sat there, he would cast it before Henri arrived.
He would not have dared.
I'll write something, but leave me a few days.
I go to France for a week.
It is important for my cover to make round trips.
While you are going to do something.
This is the report that Helena has asked you to do.
You have to deliver it to this pen drive.
You need to connect this pen drive to your computer... transfer the file of this pen drive to your computer.
The laptop?
No, the big, the fixed.
The one on top of the table in high school.
What?
Usually stores everything on the laptop.
You prefer, so you can work at home.
We know, there will be no problem.
What do you mean?
There will be no problem.
Everything okay?
I have been robbed.
Wow.
I am very sorry.
What are you going to do, beautiful.
Does the police know anything?
No.
And Phénomène?
Snoopy knew how to calm her down.
Now it's okay, psychological analysis is reassuring.
In a way, the crisis has been good for us.
It is a very positive way to see things.
Do you want the negative view?
Snoopy has given you a thumb drive.
You want it to connect to Helena Chohraganli's computer.
With a Trojan to infect the system files.
I'm clumsy, but I learn fast.
And the negative view?
Some day we will not have luck.
It will crack and spoil everything.
In a program, when there is a line of code that fails... the type that the system loads... error can take a lot to get... but it always comes.
Thank you.
I worked with Henri.
I lost.
I go to the bathroom.
It's over there.
We are lost here.
I did not want it to be.
I seemed irresponsible on his part to leave.
And for yours, let it go.
Seen the result, he was right.
How is Arthur?
Play video games.
While I wait to be recognized as an orphan of war.
Henri talked a lot about you.
And of Arthur.
At home I did not speak of anyone from here.
Never heard his name.
But you sure know why he died... while my son and I just imagine it.
Nobody will ever tell us anything.
Marie Jeanne.
Come here.
Are you okay?
The ceremony was beautiful.
Yes, but heavy.
It has moved me.
What you said about Henri, about the information...
You no longer speak?
I pause.
I am eating.
What?
The painful mater... with swollen eyes and 3 people to offer you Kleenex... for the death of Henri.
It is sensitive.
But it happens.
I think you're bad, what I was saying.
I can also offer you Kleenex if you want.
And even recover them later.
But I do not want to.
Is anyone there?
It is the oral report of Ms. Gunei on what happened to Socrates.
There is no shadow zone.
But Ms. Gunei is very affected by what happened.
It's not your fault.
We have nothing to reproach you.
And you have already agreed to continue your collaboration with us.
But she has asked to change of interlocutor.
Too many bad memories.
It has been decided that from now on I will be your referent.
I said it from the beginning, that a woman would be better.
Do not you say anything?
No.
It was she who asked to change of referent, I swear to you.
I know.
If I tell you that your mother is a whore, do not you understand me?
If you speak languages I will take you with me and I will change your life.
Answer me in French.
I yell at you to pass you a message.
In two days I will return, I will collect you and you will be free.
No one knows.
Do not get up.
And excuse me.
Mr. Director General...
Cochise has used the communication protocol... which transmitted to Henri.
We have received and analyzed your message.
We propose a plan to rescue Guillaume Debailly.
A solid plan?
An intervention during a transfer.
Give us the date, the road and the ideal place to intervene.
It is very good.
No, there is a problem.
The plan works if Cochise is found in the convoy too.
But it will betray, right?
If Cochise comes alive from the attack during the transport...
Will not escape.
He wants us to get him with Guillaume.
Then I would not be in the heart of the Islamic State...
It is not who to dictate to us conditions.
On board the convoy, Cochise can notify us in case of unforeseen... schedule changes, vehicle, itinerary...
It allows us to adapt better.
It was a mistake to mix the Cochise recruitment... and the release of Guillaume.
Cochise now thinks she's in a dominant position.
Excuse me, but no I agree.
Henri had a great idea linking both cases.
The Americans do not cease to pressure us... so that the release of Guillaume is not public.
And what better than to pair it with an exfiltration?
Well, I will make a decision.
Would you mind leaving?
You, stay.
He does not know Guillaume and knew little to Henri Duflot.
What do you think?
For the heads of the Islamic State...
Cochise will have died during the release to Guillaume.
For them will not be a desertion.
They have no reason to change plans.
And Cochise knows all his plans.
The information that will provide us here, in a hiding place... will be useful in the very short term and for the whole world.
And win a war.
Marina?
Who?
I can not tell you.
I'm no good at this, I do not know how to lie.
It was a surprise, but hey...
It's your boyfriend, it's here.
Thank you.
You were born and come to see you from your country.
Yes.
I have to go back to work.
Come, I will finish for you.
- Did not they warn you? "But they did not tell me it would be you."
He told me that he was leaving for a few days.
Prefer not to be in the country if they stop you, it is normal.
Everything good in Mortier?
We are all sad.
At least you're sad together.
I have 10 minutes left and I finish.
I was told it would take 10 seconds.
You do not copy, you implant.
That's it.
A Mossad attack. "Something fat, surely.
A time bomb intended for the computer system... of all nuclear power plants located in seismic zones.
And I will be able to study that attack.
It's great.
Do we eat together?
I will not go back to after the meal.
Okay, great.
Will we have to kiss again?
We can make couple angry.
As you wish.
That's why I've been working like crazy this afternoon.
My report.
Thank you.
Can you tell me something?
Yes.
Yes, I'll take it and look at it tonight at my house.
Have you bought another computer?
Yes, yes.
He is handsome, your boyfriend.
Do you have a lot of time?
Is that the report I gave you uses graphics made with a PC.
You will not be able to read them with a Mac if you do not convert them.
But I can do it me if you want.
We will intervene in situ to rescue Debailly.
We are studying possibilities for intervention.
One implies a specific attack on a vehicle.
The operation also allows... the exfiltration of a source of the hierarchy of the Islamic State.
It is delivered and we delivery to Debailly.
Do you want us to participate in the operation with a dron?
In exchange for sharing the source.
It is capable of giving us a hostage, so it is very well placed.
If we help get Debailly... we want to interrogate you alone and with priority.
Let me not want to leave my agent alone with someone of his.
Your agent too is a bit ours.
Sorry.
Nothing happens.
I think I've lost a friend.
I'm crazy, I know.
You have lost a friend.
I never cry.
My parents called me the stone.
Do you know what you were afraid of?
Treason?
What scared her most was not to live up to it.
Being small and mediocre.
And end in dishonor.
It said: "Everything will be settled when we are dead."
So it's all fixed.
Thanks for telling me.
Let's get her out of her hiding place.
They have packed while we were talking.
What happens?
There is an agreement between the DGSE and the CIA.
There will be a joint operation to release Guillaume.
The CIA has demanded to interrogate the first, on the spot.
It has cost us to accept, but they have agreed that it is you.
We have for a while.
Sushi or Indian?
Pray to your God, I will pray to mine.
The Cochise phone allows us to send in real time... coordinates to the satellite.
What if they get on the other car?
It is enough that Cochise is always in the same car as Malotru.
The Americans receive well the images.
They have gone out.
How much are they?
40 minutes if they continue at this speed.
Does Sherman hear us?
Come on, Mr. Gaingouin.
They are 40 minutes away.
Short.
Here Sherman, are you in position?
Do you have a gum?
Today we can both die.
I could use it.
Do you have children?
Yes.
Four guys.
How old are they?
If you want to denounce...
And we will both die, but you will have a special treatment.
So shut up and tell the one that remove the feet from my face!
What happens?
They have stopped.
What are they doing?
What does it do?
Something strange happens.
If they turn, we will miss the occasion.
How much is Sherman?
Two minutes by car... but the vehicles are camouflaged further.
Going to get them, four minutes.
The Americans should attack now.
Tell them to attack already the first vehicle.
Tell Sherman to be ready to attack.
Okay, received.
We attacked.
Do not move.
Here Sherman, we're coming.
Injured.
Where is the hostage?
And do not tell me that is in there.
Jean Marc.
My rifle.
Paul!
We can not stay here.
Here Sherman.
Cochise is wounded, but he will live.
The hostage is with us, he is alive.
Double objective fulfilled...
Guillaume.
They have sent you.
Yes.
Would you have preferred another?
I thought maybe they would send Henri.
No, it's me.
What's up?
Good.
The interrogations will begin.
Already?
Yes.
You have information that can be used right now.
How long will it last?
Several days.
The boat leaves in a few hours.
You'll change your boat often.
And then?
I do not know.
Water.
They will start now.
Hello, Guillaume.
Do you understand why I am here?
The guards have left.
He's here for the CIA.
Has not lost capabilities.
How are you?
Since yesterday it seems that there are ghosts who want to talk to me.
They put themselves before me... and they talk to me.
But the ghost is me.
I have something for you.
The face of Syria.
It has changed.
If it's a technique, I can tell you it's welcome.
Not a technique.
I needed it.
Forward.
No.
Leave your hands.
Sorry.
I did not think they were capable of doing something like that.
What?
And leave him to rot in a hard-box without a window?
I do not decide it.
Raymond, are you forced to forget what he did for you?
You also suffered.
He is one of the few who will understand what he has experienced.
Who agrees to rot in a cabin without a window.
Who agrees to pass this way from one prison to another.
From enemies to hands of a friend.
It has no strength.
That, it has no strength.
They prepare you a cabin more comfortable, with window.
I will be by the side.
Thank you.
I must stay with him in the cabin.
Lord, I have orders.
I will not leave the subject alone in the cabin.
I fix one thing and go back.
I assume it.
- Impossible. "It's my responsibility."
It is what there is.
I'll call the principal.
Meanwhile, I stay with him.
Have not you closed?
I want two men on the catwalk.
He has no strength to escape.
That's what made you believe.
