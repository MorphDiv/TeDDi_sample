This is the video deposition of Carrie Anne Mathison.
The deposition is taking place in board room "A"

I'm the videographer with Manhattan Legal Support.
Also present is Robert Emmons,
Chief of Staff for the president-elect, and George Pallis, the Solicitor General of the United States.
I will now swear in the witness.
Ms. Mathison, do you affirm you will testify to the truth, to the best of your ability, or swear to it, so help you God?

So what do you want?
I wasn't satisfied with the way our meeting went yesterday.
I felt you weren't, either, and so, those names you requested for cabinet positions--
I have them now.
Because this... friction between us... it has to end.
And you think this would help end the... friction?
I know it would.
Three candidates I would never consider for any position at any time.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
You can't really have expected anything different.
Actually, I did.
And I'd ask you to reconsider-- advise you to.
So this is your idea of advice?
Does it really matter what we call it?
Not if we're both clear on what's really going on.
You think you know better than me.
When it comes to the defense of this country,
I'm certain I do.
Oh, you're certain?
I've been at this a very long time.
At what?
What is it you think you have been at, exactly?
No, I really want to know.
Keeping America safe.

And this qualifies in your opinion?

Seriously, where do you see this going?
Do I come around to your point of view?
Do I give up, roll over?

I am the next president of the United States.
Sixty million people voted for me.
Who the hell voted for you?
Nobody.
That's right.
But I have a constituency, too.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means don't go to war with your own national security establishment.
Are you threatening me now?
I'm telling you it's a war you won't win.
Two hundred and fifty years of movement toward the light in this country, towards justice...
Say what you want, call me naive, but I believe in that light.
