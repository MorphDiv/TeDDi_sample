My name is Alice Vaughan.
- You're a cop?

I run a P.I. and security firm along with my partner, Val.
Yo!

This is my fiancé, Christopher, the man who stole my heart...
Christopher:

Please leave a message.
Alice: ...along with everything else.
I gave him my entire life savings.
What is wrong with me?
He did leave one thing behind.
He joked about getting it for me as a wedding gift.
And then when I got home last night, it was here.
You want to play?

Turns out, I wasn't his only victim.
The man I've been chasing for two years was your fiancé.
His real name is Benjamin Jones.
I was going to tell you everything.
What we had was real, and I love you.
Jules:

And he's part of something bigger.
They're called the Kensington Firm.
A British crime family.
Alice:

They're pulling a job tonight.
We'll catch them in the act, put them away, and you will be free.
You'll be charged with fraud, conspiracy, murder.
Let's not forget theft.
Where's the money?
Margot.
Margot:

Clark:

I'm the one you need to arrest.
So you can let her go and take me.

Gentlemen.
Thank you all for flying in from London.
As you know, my father always wanted the Firm to have a presence in the U.S., and the only way to achieve that is to be here.
So, welcome to Los Angeles.
I am aware that changes in leadership can be unsettling.
I assure you your loyalty will be rewarded.
Felix, Alfie.

Actually, there is.

Hello?

Felix, you were saying.
Good.
Then we can begin.
Anderson/Vaughan Investigations is back and better positioned to give you everything you need in a private investigation and security firm.
The latest in cloud-based security tech.
Our upgraded encryption software.
And an all-new team of military-trained security specialists on call 24 hours a day.
[Chuckles]
So, you guys are back up and running?
- 100%.

As soon as the FBI gives us back our files and our computers and our server.
Which they said they will do.
So, you're not under investigation?
- No, we are not.

Stop talking, Alice.

Why?

We need our clients to trust us again.
If I'm Seth Hamilton, I'm not trusting my zillion-dollar tech firm to a company who's under FBI investigation.
Seth's not like that.

I'll bet you he's exactly like that.
Look at him leaning back in his chair.
He can't get far enough away from us.
That's how fired we are.
No, he's just that comfortable here.
Except now he's out of the chair.
But smiling and shaking hand...

- He's overcompensating.

Well, thank you both for everything.
And for understanding.
Of course.
Next one, I won't say a word, I swear.
There is no next one.

So we'll go out and find new ones.
Maybe not be so picky about the kinds of clients we take on.
No, we will not become one of those low-rent, seedy P.I. firms.

Anderson/Vaughan Investigations.
It's your alarm company.
There's been a break-in at your house.
Margot.
♪ ♪
Gah!

- I'm so sorry.

I know I should've called, but I wanted to surprise you, and my key didn't work, and so I set off your alarm, and I may have broken your door.
- But I'll fix it.

Guys, he really is my brother.

You couldn't have called first?
- Aw, don't pretend you didn't miss me.

The $750 you still owe me, and that is my jacket you're wearing.
So, what's going on?
You look good.

Actually...

Of course.

No, no.

I swear.

That's the problem.
Valerie: $3 million?
The IRS says that it is in a bank account somewhere, in my name, and that I have to pay taxes on it, but I don't have that kind of money.
Or do I?

It could be an accounting error.
Or identity theft, although they usually take money.
They don't give it.
Whoever parked this money in your name knew you well enough to think you'd never find it.
So, is there a roommate or a girlfriend?
No, sadly.
- Someone you work with?

Could you guys maybe help me find out?
We could if we had our computers.
You don't have any computers?
Sophie has her hacktop.
If she can figure out where the money comes from, we can at least let the IRS know.
Or, you know, we could keep the money.
It's not yours to keep.
Yeah, but then I could pay you guys, and I could pay you back for all the money that you've loaned me over the last few decades.
We could use the money.
Not if it belongs to someone else.
So...

[Door buzzes]
Benjamin Jones,
I'd like you to meet my supervisor,
Agent Justine Diaz.
Agent Dao speaks very highly of you, Agent Diaz.
Oh, you mean Special Agent Dao, now of the FBI's Intelligence Division.
I got promoted thanks to you.
Thanks to you, Mr. Jones, we were able to put Sybil Griffiths behind bars.
And ever since, Dao has been after me to sign off on a deal that'll get you out in three to five years.
♪ ♪
I would be very grateful.
Here's the thing, though.
I have a problem with you being out on the street in three to five years.
What would you say if I told you
I could get you out of here tomorrow?
I'd say what's the catch?
- The answer is no.

You're giving me a death sentence.
We're giving you the opportunity to live exactly as you did before.
Setting up cons, pulling jobs, but looping me in so that I can collect evidence, make arrests.
Once word spreads that I'm setting people up
- for the feds...

- You're too good.

Fact.

And as much as I'd like to take the credit, the only reason you're here is because you turned yourself in.
The only reason I turned myself in was to do the three to five years and start over, get married.
- He's engaged.

I read the file.
But if I go undercover for you guys, she won't be able to get anywhere near me without endangering herself.
Which is why we're prepared to offer you other incentives.
Such as?
You'd be on retainer, with a generous expense account.
And how would you get me out of here?
We'd get your case thrown out on a technicality.
You can just do that?
We can.
- How long would this deal be?

- One.

18 months, if this job doesn't kill me first.
And exactly what kind of jobs are we talking about?
Dog walker, sign twirler, hand model.
Oh, but that got weird.
16 jobs in the last 3 months.
Did you give any of your employers your Social Security number?
You think one of them put the money in my name?
Could be.

Maybe that ferret guy in Studio City.
Ferret guy?
Oh, sorry.

Studio City?

Not long.

You didn't call me?
No.

I wanted to get my life together, get a real job before I called you.
But there are no jobs for millennials.
Sweetie, you are not a millennial.
[Gasps] Don't be mean.

It's just I'm not qualified to do anything.
Okay, what about waiting tables?
Mnh-mnh.

One customer one time.
He has a problem with authority.
No!

And it gets me into trouble.
[Elevator bell dings] That seems to run in the family.
Oh, hey, write down all your employers so we can call and do background checks.
Okay, but, you know, maybe steer clear of the ferret guy.

Good.

- He accepted the deal?

It's only 18 months.
- No!

We had a plan.

He was going straight.
He is.

All three missed payments this month, too.
Look, here's one of our opium freighters.
Apparently just vanished in the South Pacific.

Rhys.

[Groans]
Ooh, yeah.

Had to make it look realistic.
How else was I gonna break you out of there?
You did this to me?
Well, I hired someone.
He's actually a very gifted serial killer.
I'm sorry.

Well, he stabbed you just deep enough for the guards to call the ambulance, but he missed all the major organs.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, it does look a bit angry, doesn't it?
Sorry.

- Let me change that.

Well, I have to, or else it'll go septic.
Don't.
Sounds like somebody needs a painkiller.
I need a phone.
You have no idea what you've done.
And you have no idea about the lengths I had to go to to get it done, but don't bother to thank me.
Even though I made breakfast.
Rhys.
Where the hell are we?
He was stabbed?
He's not dead.

You mean you don't know?
Why don't you know?
Because he's missing.
His ambulance never arrived at the hospital.
Then why are you here instead of out looking for him?
Because it appears to be a carefully orchestrated jailbreak.
Excuse me?
No, he wouldn't have done that.
You guys just made that ridiculous deal.
Which I understand you were opposed to, so maybe he called you.
To tell me he was breaking out of jail?
I want him to stay in jail.
You're the ones that got him out.
We just need to know if he called you.
No.

Because someone with a shiv found out that he made a deal with the feds.
The United States government is gonna pay you to be a criminal?
I know it sounds good, but...
- What, just you?

Did you say, "Yeah, I'd love to do that, but not without my partner Rhys"?
We are no longer partners.
Oh.
Well, I wish I'd known that before I went to all this trouble and broke you out of jail.
I never asked you to.
Well, that's the thing about friendship, Benji.
You shouldn't have to ask.

- May I see your phone, please?

Oh, you want to call Alice, give her the good news.
That I'm not dead, yes.

Ooh, no.

Rhys, they're gonna think that I ran.
Yeah, the thing is, in order to get you out of jail,
I had to make, um certain promises.
Which I'm sure you'll keep.
But in exchange for the knife work and this lovely hideaway,
I was obliged to guarantee your involvement in a very small job.
Give me the phone.
If we don't do this, they will shank us both, and this time they won't miss the major organs.
So, you can't call the FBI, but you can call Alice.

Please tell me you're not dead.
Please tell me you find men with abdominal scars attractive.
Where are you?

It wasn't me.

Hi, Alice.
Do you want me to tell her it was Rhys?
No, I don't want you involved.
Too late.

Sorry, client emergency.
Of course.

Is that why you torched the hotel in Bilbao?
To teach me that valuable lesson?
What do you mean?
It burned to the ground.
You burned it to the ground.
That hotel was our insurance policy.
Well, that's where you're wrong because there is no payout for arson.
Your father stashed millions there...
In the walls, in the floor, in cash, in gold...

Okay.
That's okay.

I am, just a little bit.
You mind if I just warm up with a little hot oil?
Mm.
Okay, just take a few deep breaths for me.
Mm. [Sniffs]
What is that smell?
Eucalyptus, spearmint, and chloroform.

Rhys, we got to go.
Yeah, let's go.
What the hell are you doing?
Don't you want to see what's inside?
No.

Well, if this is leverage that...
[Lock clicks] ...Galinda is using against Mangels, maybe it's leverage that we can use against Mangels.
[Briefcase hisses]
Fascinating.
"Mangels, Carl.
Viable sample.
West Side Men's Fertility Clinic."
Whoa!

Galinda:

I call it a guaranteed 18 years of child support.
Now, hand over the juice, or I shoot you both dead.
- The sperm... give it to me.

Galinda...

- ...we can explain.

Okay.
It's all yours.

Alice:

Ben:

Did you just shoot her?
- No.

I would never shoot someone that looked like that, even though she was trying to kill me.
I'm sorry.

She's naked?

She's a naturalist.

She must've slipped on whatever that is on the floor.
What is that?
That's nothing.

How did you find us?
The man that Rhys hired to stab you used to work for Mangels.
Are you okay?
I am about to be just fine.
Good.
'Cause you're under arrest.
But only until Diaz can work out the terms of your new deal.
So I have a new deal?
Your little break-in gave us probable cause.
So if we search and seize enough to put the Mangels away, you got yourself a deal.
Rhys:

Hello, I'm Rhys.

I engineered the whole operation.
Careful where you step.
You don't want to slip and get pregnant.
This will all make perfect sense once I explain it to you.
Will it?
No.
- Not at all.

You look... way better than I do.
You, uh, tucked your shirt in.
Yes, I did.

Thank you.

Don't be an idiot.

I've imposed enough already... and besides, Alice was right.
I can't take that money.
I'm sorry.

I couldn't hear you.
I can't take that money because you changed the password.
Mm-hmm.

You can stay and help us find out whose money that is, and at the end of the day, if it's free and clear, it's yours.
And how are you gonna do that?
Well, now that we have our files back...
Wait.

...and our computers, thanks to Dao.
- Thank God.

We can get back to work.
But it's up to you.
You guys coming?
You owe me a dinner.
Yep.
Didn't I promise you?
Yes, you did.
And I promised you... that we would celebrate.
Look, I'm not sure I want to anymore.
Turns out my promotion comes with a transfer to Washington, D.C.
So this is how you want to do it?
The minute I start to show a little interest, you play hard to get.
Look.
We could always do the long-distance thing.
Because that always works.
Or... walk away before we get hurt.
Or... we could celebrate.

Ben:

Undercover for 18 months.
Under these covers.
You can't come over to your P.I. girlfriend's house when you're out there pretending to be a mobster.
Well, you'll have to come over to my place.
What about Rhys?
That's a good point.
He'd want to have a three-way.
You can't come over.
I guess we can sneak around.
Ah, sneaking around, secret sex... that's no fun.
I know, but... guess I just imagined us going grocery shopping together, holding hands in public, not having to have a gun and an escape route handy at all times.
Yeah, that would be nice.
For about a day.
Then you'd need your gun 'cause you'd be so bored you'd want to blow your brains out.

Well, I want to meet him.

How dare Rhys accuse me of treachery when he's the one who plotted against me in the first place.
I mean, am I wrong?
Not at all.

Oh, God, I told you I can't bear compliments from people on payroll.
Right.

I'm fine.
