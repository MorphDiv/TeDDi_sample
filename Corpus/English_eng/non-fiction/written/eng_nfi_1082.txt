Has your mom made a decision on the London job offer yet?
Don't you think you'll hear as soon as I've heard?
Have you heard?
How can I pretend that this isn't happening if you keep bringing it up?
London is 3,459 miles away from New York.
What?

We need to face this, Riles.
This is the end of Riley and Maya.
How could you say that?
How could you even think that?
Riley and Maya are forever no matter where we are.
Remember our third best friend Kerri Abelson?
Oh, yeah.

She moved across the street.
(both scream)
Wow, so much emotion.
Why is everybody so emotional when nothing's happening?
Because it is happening, Riley.
Why are you so sure?
Look at the board.
Belgium 1831.
The Netherlands was a group of friendly states who thought they'd stay together forever...
Uh-oh.
Belgium 1831 is us.
...until Belgium made the decision it was time to go.
Uh-oh!

What do I do?
- You...

He erases it if you ask important questions!
Gotcha.
Why are we here?
What is the meaning of love?
Is there a destiny that shapes our ends?
What's the deal with artificial intelligence?
If it's artificial, can it be intelligent?
Yes.
It was decided that Belgium would no longer be part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, but its own independent country.
Belgium was free.
Did people visit it?
- People like who?

Did they visit it or did they forget her like Kerri Abelson?
Oh, yeah.

- She moved across...

At that point, Belgium was no longer part of a group, but its own sovereign nation... ready to meet the world on its own terms.
What if it wasn't ready yet?
What if none of us are ready for this?
I'm not ready for this, Riley.
So, Belgium 1831 was gonna be about our own freedom when we left this place?
That was my plan.
But sometimes, things happen in life earlier than they're supposed to.
So, what do we do?
We do our best.
Like we've always done.
We leave our good mark and we hope that people remember us fondly.
I did my best.
I hope that you remember me fondly.
I'll remember you fondly.
Thank you.

Kerri Abelson.
Oh no.

This is the worst thing that could ever happen to me in my young life.
Oh, Auggie.
No matter what happens, you're gonna be okay.
What about the fury of a woman ripped from the arms of the man she loves?
Ooh, the wife.
How is she taking it?
It's Ava.

(British accent) 'Ello, 'ello.
It's me...
Twiggy.
How do you know about Twiggy?
I know all about me new British mates.
I know about Posh and Becks, and all three Harrys:
Styles, Potter, and me first husband, the Prince.
But it's me you love.
I know, ducky, but Momma needs a crown.
Ava, what are you doing?
If we're all gonna reside in merry ol' England,
I thought that I should know about me new home.
- Honey...

Ava...
I spoke to my mom and she said I could go.
- Really?

I'm afraid of the actual answer.
My mom says that the decision hasn't been made yet, but I'm afraid it has.
(normal voice) How do you make this kind of decision?
How is a decision like this made?
Is it tougher to leave something you love or stay when you could be missing an opportunity?
Well, that depends.
On what, Mr. Babineaux?
What you're leaving behind.
Anybody else?
To be fair, I think it's important to know what's waiting for you wherever you're going.
Right.
Lucas and Zay both left someplace that they loved.
They were right to love Texas.
We had the best time there.
And we've had the best time here.
So Belgium left the United Kingdom of the Netherlands,
-then what happened?

Okay.
Anyone else want to try?
The United Kingdom of the Netherlands fell completely apart.
Maya, you look something up?
No.
I didn't have to.
You don't really have to be smart to know what's coming.
It's Farkle who's been smart.
It's Farkle who's wanted to know what Belgium 1831 was ever since it went up on the board.
It's Farkle who's always loved us and tried to protect us.
Sorry, Smackle.
Riley, I know your mother.
I know she'll seek out the advice of everyone close to her.
I know she'll listen to what we have to say.
And I know her decision will be the right one.
No matter what it is?
No matter what it is, we go with her.
So, Mom will listen to the people she cares about before she decides?
She's probably doing that right now.
Hi.
Mom?
Yeah.
Big decision, and I wanted some advice.
Who better to give us advice than... these people who've all loved each other forever?
(whispering) Fa-ha-fa...
Fa-ha-hay...
Fa-fa-fa...
I'm not talking to you!
And I'm not talking to you.
Fine.
Double fine.
I taught you that!
And I taught you everything else.
Then why don't I know anything?

Hey, Morgan.

My brothers!

Yeah, you know, we haven't all been in the same place together for a long time.
I don't think we've ever been in the same place together.
No.
Okay, we're gonna do this one at a time.
- Mm.

All right, look, as much as I'd hate it if you guys went anywhere, when we left Philadelphia to come to New York, that worked.
If we didn't do that, I never would have met Katy.
If we didn't do that, I...
I wouldn't be happy.
We wouldn't have Maya.
Oh, guys, I'm not actually your daughter though...
I'll never forget when we first saw you in the hospital delivery room.
Wow, I'd really love to rewrite history, but...
History is history.
First thing you have to know to teach History.
Matthews, as your former English teacher,
I say let 'em write what they want to.
Hey, Jon.
Hey, Shawn.
Hey, Shawn's wife.
Boy, that makes me happy saying that.
Hey, Shawn's wife!
(laughs)
Hey.
Thank you for everything you've done to help make Shawn who he is.
Yeah...
I'll never forget the time I saw him in that hospital delivery room.
(giggles)
Okay, crazy people.
You can't just make life how you want it.
Yeah.

Like our decision that you guys are going to help us with.
Us now!
She's right.

Just gonna...

What...

You want to adopt me?
-Yay!

Both:

You know, Maya, I talked with Shawn and your mom about this.
I always regretted that I never adopted Shawn.
Well, you know, my parents tried to adopt Shawn, but he preferred to stay a street urchin.
I know this is a difficult decision to make.
I'll tell you what's a difficult decision: ours.
Yeah, can you hold your little Topanga horses?
Take all the time you need.
I'm Maya Hunter.
(both chuckle)
Da...

Dad...

- Hey, Dad?

I'm sorry.
-For what?

Oh, and I'm going to London with them.
Let her!

We can only give you our parents' advice.
We raised you to be good people and we know that you will make your best decision.
But then you leave.
You leave for college, you leave for New York, and now you're gonna fly across the ocean and take away my grandchildren.
Me too, me too.
Tell them not to take us away, Aunt Morgan.
I know what it's like to be the youngest one in the family.
You think nobody is listening to you or your ideas, but they are.
You're very important, and they'll take everything you say into consideration.
How can I be sure that everything is gonna be okay?
Because life knows that in order to be the best person you can be, sometimes it's good to stay, sometimes you gotta go.
I was once the youngest, just like you.
Is there gonna be another me?
Too late.

Good.
Just know that your parents are gonna make the right decision for you.
They always do.
Trust them.

Being the youngest is really important.
You're the one they hold on to.
Or not.
You don't need me for this.
Of course we do.
You've always given us our best advice.
What do you got for us now?
London... the city of Shakespeare and Dickens.
I think you'll flourish there just as you flourished here.
You're telling us to go.
I told you to go to Yale, too.
Why didn't you?
I got a better offer.
And now you have another.
And I'm sure you'll choose wisely, because you were always the best test-taker.
What about me?
Don't listen to him.
I just got hit by the subway!
Okay, so what's the problem?
Mom got a job offer in England.
What?

Wait a second, I can play Topanga.
- Eric!

Perfect.
Are you gonna surprise us with incredible advice out of your idiot mouth or not?
I am, yes.

Now, listen, when I was elected Senator in two-thousand-aught-fifteen, I've come to realize that what might be a clear decision for some is not so clear for me.
Look... listen to your heart.
Your heart is what's gonna tell you what to do.
And then go and find your favorite quiet place.
Mine is under the ocean.
Don't take my spot!
Something happened to me and Farkle, Riley.
What?
Well, we were studying molecular structure, and it occurred to us that we are all made with particular molecules.
And if anything changes, then we're simply not who we were.
We are actually different.
That's very interesting, guys.
What?
If you leave us, we will actually be different.
And that's when it occurred to me that I was feeling sadness.
I identified it as sadness, because I was crying.
- You don't cry.

But now I know it was because nothing has ever made me sad enough before.
I just wanted to say thank you for these feelings, Riley.
Oh!
Smackle, getting so good at these.
- Hey, Riley.

Just want to let you know that I'll make sure Lucas is okay.
You will?
Oh, I'll walk him and feed him and make sure he never forgets about you.
I will never forget about her.
That's a good boy!

Thank you, Zay.
Want to know something?
What?
Our circle of friends was never complete until you showed up.
Smackle, I'm feeling somethin'.
Sadness!
I'm good at emotions now.
I've loved you since the first grade.
I know.
I always will, wherever you are.
Thank you, Farkle, but maybe you shouldn't say that in front of Smackle.
Riley, explain the role of uranium in nuclear fission.
Uh, I don't know.
Yeah, you're a threat.
Guys, no decision has been made yet.
There's a good chance she's not going anywhere.
Actually, I know she's not going anywhere because life knows there's no replacement for her because nobody cares about me as much as she does, so that's how I know she's not going anywhere, so ha.
Hey.
What do you want?
I was thinking about you guys and what you all must be feeling.
Thought I should come over.
Would it be okay if I sat with you guys here?
Oh, my gosh.
I know what this is.
Life is trying to replace you.
Life moves fast.
Life does a good job.
Wait.
You're actually leaving.
You're really gonna go.
You guys are gonna be fine.
We all will be fine.
We have to be fine.
Okay?
Smackle.
No matter whatever happens to me in my whole life, you will always be my first girlfriend.
Years from now, whenever anybody asks me,
"Who was your first girlfriend?"
I will always answer, "Riley Matthews."
And I will always answer, "Lucas Friar."
I hope that you get to be a veterinarian someday.
And I hope that wherever you are, you get to keep being Riley.
Bay window?
Bay window right now.
My mother says that I can't go to London with you.
She wants me with her.
That's what I expected.
I was a little surprised.
And kids have to live with their parents' decisions.
There's nothing we can do.
Except hope that they make the right ones.
You know that this won't affect us, right?
I'm Mrs. Auggie Doggie Matthews wherever you are.
And I will always be Mister... ♪ Ava Mor-gen-stern ♪
Yeah.
Yeah.
Your turn now?
Yeah.
I don't think that we can do any better than that.
Maya?
(crying) Goodbye, Riley.
No.
Mom?
Topanga, you're sittin' in the dark.
Yeah.

Sorry, I've been thinking for a long time.
Turns out... this is my quiet place.
Have you made your decision?
Yes.
Please don't try to talk me out of it.
We won't.
We know better.
You've always done what's best for us, so do this one for you.
Thank you, Cory.
Yeah.
No matter what it is, we're gonna be fine.
You know why?
Because you have good friends.
And you've had good teachers.
-Yeah.

- Yeah.

- So?

A new place, a new adventure, my promotion.
There are a whole bunch of reasons to go.
You got any reasons to stay?
Only one.
Every time I watch you girls in the bay window,
I've remembered how much we wanted a place like it of our own.
- Yeah, we called it a nook.

A place where important decisions are made and the best next steps of your life are planned and considered.
We would do great in England.
We would do great anywhere in the world.
I could run the London office.
Maybe someday, I'll get to run the New York office.
But the place I love running is this place that we're in right now.
Where your friends come in and you plan the best next steps of your life... like we're doing right now.
This is my bay window.
And I'm not leaving it.
I told you she'd make the right decision.
(chuckles)
(both scream)
Belgium 1831.
What have you learned?
Farkle?
There comes a time when the right thing to do is to leave the friends you know, see what's out there, and face a new world.
Yeah?
What do you have to say about that?
Not yet.
There are lots of places you'll go.
I remember another time we were all going someplace.
And what I said to... you... seems like yesterday.
Come here.

You know what's out there?
The world.
You're gonna be part of it someday.
Yeah.
You're gonna learn from it every day.
Gonna make mistakes.
You're gonna make good friends, too.
And even though it'll seem like the world goes out of its way to teach you hard lessons...
It's the same world that gave you your friends and your family.
You'll come to believe the world is gonna protect you, too.
You're gonna come to believe that the world is gonna protect you, too.
"Boy Meets World."
Now I get it.
Give me five.
Give me a hug.

You ready to go inside?
Topanga!
- Topanga!

(sighs)
"Girl Meets World."
Now I get it.
"Topanga's."
Yeah. "Topanga's."
That's me.
You still open?
Yeah.
We're not going anywhere.
So, after you've met the world for a while, the best thing that happens is to find out just where it is you belong.
We did.
Now it's your turn.
Big world.
Ours now.
People are gonna come in and out of our lives.
Who knows where we're all gonna end up?
Who knows if the decisions we're gonna make are right or wrong?
Promise me this?
Okay.
Time and distance have no power over us.
You and I are together for as long as we live.
Thunder.
Lightning.
Done.
