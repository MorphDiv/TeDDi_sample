Previously on "Emerald City..."
- What is this place?

For anyone who violates the Wizard's law against magic.
Help me.
- What happened to you?

Squeeze the trigger.
The Witch of the East is dead.

There is only one man to blame.
Where does the roadlead?
To the Wizard of Oz.
And he can probably take me home.
Find out who or what fell from the sky.
Make sure it doesn't come back to Emerald City.
So I say "who's there," even though I know it's you.
- Right.

Let's just try itagain.
Knock, knock.
Knock, knock.
Why are you knocking?
What about... baseball?
Have you ever heard of baseball?
I might have.
Who's to say?
Do you remember anything from here?
Anything you recognize or makes you feel something?
- Yeah.

You.
How long have you been saving that?
A few miles.
I think I'll meet Glinda at the foot of the Eternal Warrior.
Show of strength.
But meeting her halfway... shouldn't you make her come to you?
If I didn't know better, I'd think you were on my side, Isabel.
Glinda may have chosen me, but I serve you.
Your pregnancy says otherwise.
Glinda of the North has arrived.
Witches.
You may have outlawed their magic, but your people still love them.
'Cause they don't know them.
The Bowler said he he'd never seen a wound like it before.
A hole... carved neatly out of our sister's head.
She was to see me when it happened.
Matters of great import.
Any idea what?
You look terrible.
It's been 20 years.
Time ravages.

Like you didn't just crawl out of a poppy field.
Where I crawl is none of your problem.
It is, actually.
The Wizard has granted my request to open our sacred temple.
But it won't make any difference if your tongue's not right.
My tongue is perfect.
We are the last Cardinal Witches, you and I.
If you cannot sing your sister properly and right her to rest, then she will be the last.
And we'll be nothing.
I will sing her properly and right.
I'll get us what we need.
Then we can put another 20 years between us.
What's Eamonn looking for?
The girl went round the mountain, and he's staring through it.
Has he gone mad?
Why don't you go and ask him?
Think I won't?
I'm not spending another night out here.
Would you mind telling us what we're still doing here?
Ojo said the girl went round the pass.
Ojo was lying.
Eamonn.
Eamonn!
We shouldn't be here.
What is this place?
Cesspool of witches.
And look at him.

Gonna get us all killed hunting for some girl who fell from the sky.
So I'll tell you what... we break south, find the girl ourselves, ride back to Emerald City with her head, then we'll have the Wizard's loyalty.
No, Eamonn's not gonna let us break off.
Yeah, you're right.
Guess we'll have to kill him.
We'll cut him into bits.
Make it look like lions did it.
Do you want me to slow down?
Ha.

Yeah, I have people waiting for me.
What kind of people?
People.
Ah.
- Someone you laid with.

Laid with?


I'm not having this conversation with you, Lucas.
- Why not?

Well, you saved me, so how does that work?
No.
I'm a nurse.

- What?

Lucas?
Lucas!

Put pressure, okay?
We're gonna get you help.
You're just a little septic, but I've already stopped the bleeding, so you're fine.
All you need is a shot of penicillin... it's the most common drug in the world.
My world.
Hi, sir, my friend is dying, and I need some medicine.
Do you know where I can find any?
Medicine, uh... doctor, pharmacy.
For him.
- Apothecary?

Yes, an apothecary.
Where can I find one?
She don't take to visitors.
Look, sir, I'm begging you... please.
I just need to know where she is, otherwise he's gonna die.
What are you up to, boy?
Ma'am?
There's a chill.
I'm all right.
It's time for your medicine.
I think no more of that, love.
You need rest.
I'm off to get a chicken for dinner.
You're leaving?
I'll be back soon, Tip.

- Jack?

How much time do we have?
She went to the butcher's.
- What?

- Well, how long is that?

I can't take it anymore, Jack.
You've got to find a way in.
Today's the day.
May I present Maiden of Northern Light,
Mother of the Sound and Pure, and the Mistress of the Western Fields,
Vessel, solace...
Yeah, yeah, Vessel, solace, truth...
I spend half my life waiting to walk in and out of rooms.
Glinda.
It's been some time.
The North is always open to you.
Isabel?
This is Anna.
She'll be true and chaste, without distraction of body and mind.
To better serve you.
Nope, nope.
You stay.

Well, don't look at her.

Come.

My condolences regarding your Eastern sister.
We appreciate you unsealing our temple so we can honor her properly.
I know that wasn't possible with Mother South.
The Beast Forever was merciless with her.
So...
I have a... request of my own.
Mistress East and I, we had a partnership.
The Prison of the Abject.
Yes, an unfortunate name.
An unfortunate prison.
It wasn't my creation.
We can't unlock it, if that's what you want.
So whatever magic she used to open it,
I give you my permission to re-create it.
I wish we could, but a witch's spells are her own.
And there are a thousand variations.
Normally, East would've had an apprentice to pass along the fruit of her tongue, but... you put an end to all that, didn't you?
If there's nothing else, we have preparations to make.
You feeling all right, Mistress?
Hmm?
Perfect.
Jack!
- There's no way through!

Look, it's too hard.
- Mate, you can't give up.

Not until I'm through.
And then we're gonna...

Yeah.
Get the heck out of here.
Jack, someone's coming up the hill.
- What?

- Hurry!

Just go!

Excuse me?

I'm looking for a woman called Mombi.
Hey!
Careful.

It's gonna be okay.
My friend needs help.
Your friend is past help.
No, I just...

Do you have any honey?
What about goldenseal or chaparral?
- Or onions, or...

You can use what you can find and then be on your way.
Thank you.

Miss?
Forgive me, it was wrong of me not to offer help.
Bring him inside.
Thank you.
- That's very kind of you.

You're having one of your days.
No, ma'am.
It's all right, boy, I know... it must be hard sometimes, just being cooped up in here.
Who would want that?
But with your condition, to be exposed to... all that's out there...
At least with this, you're still alive.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm going to go and check on our guests.
Ah, your potion seems to be working.
It's just an herbal remedy.
What kind of witch are you?
I'm not.
But I get that a lot here.
And you?
How long have you been in the Wizard's Guard?
I...
I don't know.
Cross stitched at the hilt.
Ceremonial hilt.
Wizard's Guard!
So...
I have a not witch, whose potions raise the dead, and a not Wizard's Guard who carries their sword.
What else... are you not?
I don't know what you're asking.
I don...

Liar!
He's telling the truth.
When I found him in Nimbo, he was barely alive.
So it was you.
He couldn't even remember his name.
I know what Wizard's Guard did at Nimbo.
Burned and tortured.
I was there.

No, what they did to those people, they did to me, too.
And yet you carry their sword.
Whatever you've done... however many you've killed... whatever un... thinkable horror you perpetrated... your mind has done the same thing back... made it unthinkable.
Dorian.
Dorian!
Dorian.
Poor sod.
Lions.
Think how many sisters have been sung to rest here.
I'd rather not.
When this is done, when we have what we need, you can go back to forgetting.
Am I interrupting?
These doors... haven't been unsealed for a generation.
But I hear the ceremony is beautiful.
So I'm opening up the funeral to the public.
I...

Yeah.
What witches... used to be.
That lunatic hopes to embarrass you.
Us.
I'll be perfect.
Toto!
Toto.
No!
Go.
Who's up there?
Uh, I think it's time for you and the Wizard's Guard to leave.
Why did they write that?
Tell me or I'm gonna go get help.
It's a boy.

Who's prone to hysterics.
Who you keep locked up.
Why do you think I live in a town with no name?
A place on no map?
It's to protect him.
From what?
From everything.
I may not be his mother, but I feel what all mothers feel.
- What's that?

All the time.
In everything.
From the minute they are born into the world, the world tries to take them right back.
Well, you can't protect him forever.
Didn't your mother protect you?
Don't you wish she had?
Forever and always?
Now you understand.
We'll speak of it no more.
Anna, is it?
Where are the others?
They're preparing for the funeral.
Not the best circumstance for your inaugural time.
It gives me a chance to familiarize myself with your science.
Must be overwhelming.
On the contrary, it feels... like second nature.
Numbers and patterns and theorems... they're beautiful.
As beautiful as magic.
Would you like to join me for the funeral?
I hear it's quite a show.
Out of my way.
Get off of me!

What did you do?
Nothing you need to worry for.
You let him do this to you.
No one does anything to me.
I will... if you get this wrong.
I will.
Oh!
Which do you think I am?
A murderer or a traitor?
It's not... it's not like that.
Isn't it?
Like you said... who knows who you are.
Or what you've done.
I don't know if it's true.
It doesn't feel like me.
Keep the sword, if it puts your mind at ease.
Do you know what would put me at ease?
Us getting out of here.
Lucas.
What's wrong?
Oh, my God.
Lucas...
Lucas, you've been poisoned.
So I need you to put your head to the side and open your mouth.
Open your mouth!
Keep it there, okay?
Be right back.
Stay with me, Lucas.
Stay with me.
Stay with me, Lucas.
Stay with me.
It's just charcoal.
It'll soak up the poison.
You have to drink it all.
Swallow, Lucas, swallow.
Dorothy.
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Did you get them?
Are her spells inside you?
You wretched waste.
My tongue... perfect.
Come on, we're getting you out of here.
- We?

Jack!
Hurry.

We have to get out of here now.
Come on, come on!
Tip!

Open the door!

- Hurry up!

Toto, go!
Come on.

Damn it!
There's not enough.
We can find more.
Unlock the door!
- Oh, look.

Tip!
No.
I'm not stealing from her.
I don't want any part of her.
Tip!

Let me out of here!
Tip!

I order you!
Come on!
Come on, Lucas.

What have you done with him?

He's gone.
You have no idea what you've done!
He's free.
I... was...

I was saving him!
You... aah!
Lucas?
Lucas, stop.
Lucas, stop!

Stop!
We'd have lived a year on what that dagger would have sold for.
Why'd she have it?
I don't know.
She never told me anything.
But if I took it, it would have been a part of her that followed me around.
You all right?
I need that medicine.
What if it's the only thing keeping me alive?
- She ever tell you about that?

I got "bad blood."
Oh, heck, who doesn't?
How is your sister?
Alive, no thanks to you.
What she does, she does to herself.
What she does, she usually does in private.
For a ruler expecting The Beast Forever, you spend the goodwill of your friends freely.
Am I your friend?
Truly?
I've outlawed your gifts.
My Eternal Warrior stands poised to lay waste to your temple.
Mother South is dead.
Which means there'll be no more witches born in Oz.
How can you say I'm your friend and mean it?
You've saved Oz when magic could not.
You charged me with selecting your High Council.
And I extended my hand.
I always assumed you'd taken it.
Safe travels north.
I'm sure you'll have less fanfare on your departure than you did on your arrival.
Go!
Knock, knock.
Knock, knock.
Knock, knock.
Tip?
Tip!
Tip?
Tip?
Is that you?
Hey, that's my friend's coat!
Stop!
Stop!
What're you doing with that coat?
It's mine.
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine.
What?
It's me, Jack.
Something's happened.
Tip?
