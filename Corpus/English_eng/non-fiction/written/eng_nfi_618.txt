McGee, I can't talk now.
Where are you?

I'm following him now.
Alone?

Yeah, well, I understand that.
Well, it happened kind of quick.
We're supposed to be working together.

Suspect was covered in blood, armed with this.
Claimed he was NCIS, but no credentials.
Said he was working undercover.
I had to take him into custody.
Is he one of yours?
So they tell me.
You did the right thing, Pete.

Mm-hmm.
Pride.
We met over MTAC.
Nick Torres.
You make quite a first impression, Nick Torres.
Less than two hours in my city, and you get yourself arrested as a suspected murderer.
That's got to be some kind of record.
I got an explanation.
Yeah, you and Special Agent McGee were sent to New Orleans to recover stolen Intel, yes?
Yes.

It's a collection of scenarios for viable terrorist attacks against the U.S.
Stolen from Homeland Security.

What I don't know is why you ran an operation without checking in first.
Tracking down a former contact of my undercover days.
That would be the murder victim.
Ferdinand Pisco.

Uh, he's in town to acquire the Playbook.
Had to handle it, um... delicately.
Ah.
That word must have a different meaning up in D.C.
But down here, in New Orleans, at Mardi Gras,
NCIS likes to keep a lower profile.
Pride, I was supposed to check in.

But all I did was follow the guy.
Someone else killed him.
Probably to make sure
Ferdinand didn't get the Playbook.
Probably.
Mm-hmm.
We have to find out who.
And here's a silly question-- um... you think you could take these, uh, handcuffs off me now?
Haven't decided yet.
Pride, I'm telling you, my second impression is so much better than the first.
One can only hope.
Loretta.
Dwayne.
This is not exactly how I expected to spend the weekend before Mardi Gras.
Imagine it wasn't how Ferdinand Pisco expected it would go either.
I don't think he even realized he was injured until it was too late.
It's a single stab wound, as far as I can tell.
Maximum damage in minimum time.
- Anything on the killer?

Spoke to multiple witnesses who positively I.D.'d the suspect.
Unfortunately, they all described him.
Nick Torres.

I'm Gregorio.

So embarrassing.

Krewe of Commedia.
They had their annual party here.
Uh, crew of what now?
It's a New Orleans thing I'm still not clear on.
It means there were over a hundred Harlequins dressed like that last night.
NOPD's interviewing as many as they can round up.
Anyone who can kill like this had an escape route-- long gone.
Oh, man, that's so gross.
What you got there, Sebastian?
Victim's cell phone.

I'm gonna need to go home and take, like, a long Silkwood shower.
Looks water damaged.

Oh, yeah, I'm on it.
Gregorio, check surveillance.

Torres here.
Mm-hmm.

Any update on who that might be?
That would be McGee's department.
Where's McGee?
It is absolutely crazy out there.
Agent McGee, finally in New Orleans.
How you doing?
And your first Mardi Gras in the quarter.
I see you've already caught on to the New Orleans vibe.
Day drinking is step one.
I-I am not day drinking.
Someone forced this into my hand.
Yeah, if you say so, glitter boo.
I do, uh, come bearing gifts, however.
Can I use your computer?
Absolutely.
Been tracking the digital trail of whoever stole the Playbook in the first place.
They've been making some moves the last couple days.
Yeah?

NSA's had an uptick in their chatter about the Playbook.
Thief is putting it up for auction.
It's going to the highest bidder.
So multiple bad actors from all over the globe trying to make a bid.
Timothy McGee.
Make yourself at home.

How are you?

Morning.
So, New Orleans at Mardi Gras is perfect for an auction like this.
Million visitors in the city, half of them in masks.
Easy to slip in and out without being seen.
Well, then let's hit the streets.
Let's get that Playbook back.
Uh, you're not hitting anything after last night.
Hey, I took initiative to contact Ferdinand Pisco.
I'm not the reason the operation went sour.
I'm not the one you need to convince.
Hey, boss.
Yeah.
He's right here.
Actually, he wants to talk to Pride.
Are you holding up okay, Dwayne?
Wish Homeland's mess hadn't ended up in our backyard, but we'll deal with it.
Got backup available if you want it.
More agents means more questions.
I want to keep this contained.
That's gonna be hard to do.

Every agency in D.C. wants in.
I just got through hand-holding the FBI on the Javier Garcia case.
Don't need a sequel.
Roger that.

Appreciate it, Jethro.
You always had a gentler way with the suits.
Sorry, that wasn't a joke?
Send Torres in.
We need to talk.
You got it, boss.
McGee.

What is that around your neck?
Oh, uh, they're beads.

Trying to get into the--
Never mind.
Wrong door.
So I was able to retrieve data off of Ferdinand Pisco's busted cell phone.
- What'd you get?

He was, uh, communicating with whoever stole the Playbook.
They were supposed to meet in the Quarter.
Yeah, someone killed Pisco before the meeting took place.
Well, able to get us anything on Pisco or the thief from the texts?

But I was able to trace the serial number from the phone, and it was one of five burner phones purchased together at an airport kiosk a few days ago.
Five phones can mean five buyers.
All we have to do is track the phones, and we find all the buyers.
Tracking the phones isn't that easy.
Can't you just trace the ping from the cellular towers and triangulate or whatever?
No, it's-it's 2017 now, Sonja.
The era of the ping is long gone.
Even cheap burner phones are GPS enabled.
You know, the real GPS tracking expert is Patton, and he's off consulting JSOC on some online security issue.
Hey, you know, uh, I don't mean to brag, but I wrote an algorithm that is kind of a game changer in satellite circles.
- Geez.

Uh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

Oh, you have?
Well, you went from tech support to special agent overnight.
Sort of a legend at FLETC.
At least, you know, to me.
It-it wasn't quite that simple.
But, uh, this is.

Let me show you this.

Whoa, this is, this is amazing.
There's no way that this is, uh, a rigid tracking algorithm.
No, no, no.

Of course.

To who?
Oh, wait.

Somewhere near Armstrong Park.
I'm getting the exact coordinates now.
Nice.
Got a lot of tourists and a bunch of drunks.
Not sure who we're looking for.
Any clues to help us out, Sebastian?
All I can tell you is that whoever is using that burner phone is actively texting right now.
Well, think I see our target.
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to turn around, put your hands in the air!
She's dead.
Stabbed just like Pisco.
It just happened.
Yeah, and whoever did it was just here.
According to DNA, this is Monica Grange.
U.S. citizen traveling under a Canadian alias.
Wanted in four different countries for ties to a Syrian terrorist group.
Yeah, been off the grid for years acting as a middleman, buying weapons, Intel, explosives.
Probably in town to bid for the Playbook, just like Ferdinand.
And just like Ferdinand, she got stabbed before she could make contact with whoever the seller is.
Two operatives in town murdered within a day.
Killer could be another buyer taking out the competition.
Easier to negotiate if everyone else is dead.
Well, Sebastian and McGee are tracking down the remaining burner phones and buyers.
Well, as for our killer, all we got is footage of the suspect running away last night.
So how do we get the Playbook back?
Talk to me.
Monica Grange was corresponding with the killer before she died.
They were supposed to meet tonight.
We have Monica's phone.
I have a clean identity.

I'll go in in her place.
Seller's proven to be careful-- not gonna have the Playbook on him at the meeting.
Anyone but a woman shows up, seller could spook.
Well, what if I go in as Monica?
I mean, she's been off the grid, no current photo.
Seller will have no idea.
Seller will have every idea.
I'm sorry, but you reek of cop.
You trying to say I smell?

Like the flair you had last night when you got arrested?
Oh, really?

Look, all I'm trying to say is if we want to get the Playbook back quietly, then I'm your girl.
Gregorio's right.
Study up on Monica Grange until the seller reaches out.
I got to go to autopsy.
What'd you find, Loretta?
Frightful symmetry, I'm afraid.
Both victims killed with a single stab between the ribs puncturing the heart, bled out within moments.
Probably didn't even realize they were stabbed before it was too late.
The weapon was thin-bladed.
Stiletto, most likely.
Killer's a skilled expert who can slip in and out of a crowd without being noticed.

DNA, fingerprints.
Trained intelligence agent?
Or an assassin.
Whoever the killer is, we need to contain him now.
A highly skilled assassin roaming the streets of New Orleans at Mardi Gras.
Dwayne.
Maybe it's time to call in the cavalry.
Well, if we do that, it won't just be the FBI coming.
Be CIA, too.

Yeah, it'll be like the Wild West.
Can't let that happen.

McGee and I were able to hack the last three burner phones.
Means we can track their locations.
Yeah, well, we can do better than that.
We're gonna draw the buyers to us.
Send them text messages, pretending to be the seller, then sweep them up-- classic false flag operation.
And what does that mean, exactly?
I have no idea-- something that McGee said.
But it sounds really cool, right?
Chris, Sonja, help McGee and Sebastian bring in the buyers.
And remember, any one of them could be our killer.
Need you to proceed with caution.
You got it.
That's the entirety of Interpol's file on Monica Grange.
It's barely a page long.
It'll have to do.
She's a lawyer by profession, so you're gonna have to pretend like you understand law.
Don't need to pretend.
I am a lawyer; went to law school before joining the FBI.
She's fluent in Arabic.
I'm assuming you're not.
No, but I dated an Egyptian once and learned a phrase or two.
You know, you're pretty cocky for someone that's never worked undercover before.
Oh, I've worked undercover ops before.
Yeah, well, I'm not talking about a couple of days of playing make-believe, take down a drug dealer.
I'm talking about spending years being another person.
So long that you... you forget who you really are.
Fascinating.
But all I need is an hour or two to get the Playbook back, so...
And all you need is to screw up once, and this entire situation goes pear-shaped.
You know, I may not be fluent in Arabic, but I am fluent in body language, and it's killing you to ride the bench.
It's killing me to ride the bench.
You know, I'm not a bench guy;

Not much of a team player, huh?
No, this, uh... team thing has been pretty recent.
It's an adjustment.
I get it.

Yeah, I mean, inside jokes alone...
Yeah, and you're never fully confident that they actually need you, right?

Exactly.
Well, I'm gonna need you, Torres, 'cause I have no idea what I'm doing.
So let's just start there, all right?
It's the seller.
Meeting's at 8:00.
Sazerac Bar.
I'll let Pride know.
Not gonna want to do that, Sebastian.
Keep your eyes forward or on me.
Well, how-how will we know when the target's here?
Window reflections.
Got a security mirror up there.
There's about five other ways to know what's going on behind us.
What, I still got glitter in my hair?
No.
Well, yeah, but that's not it.
You're a nerd like me, you know?
But you're, like, this badass nerd.
You're so good at this.
Eh.

No, you-you make it look easy.
I just keep messing up.
Look... when I was a probie, I messed up all the time.
Okay?

But I was fortunate;

Well, they must have been very patient and forgiving, then.
They were merciless.

But you know what?
They always had my six, and I always had theirs.
Buyer's here.
The windbreaker, duck boots.
All right.
All right, I'll send him out to the alley away from everyone, so we can pick him up there.

All right, you zig, I zag.

Follow him.

Hi.

I'm a federal agent...
Stop-stop resisting.
Stop resisting.

Just...
We're all gonna be fine.
What was that, like, a...

Mossad technique an old friend of mine taught me.
All right, we got to get him up here, get him in the car.
Yeah.

Pride got a positive I.D.

Good.
Eva Azarova?
I thought we put her away last year for espionage.
Yeah.

Now she's trying to sell it.
Gregorio's made contact.
Well, hopefully, she gets the Playbook back before anyone else gets hurt.
Yeah.

Though ours isn't talking.
Yeah, North Korean operative.
Just sits there like he doesn't understand a word we're saying, smiling and nodding.
You guys have any better luck?
No.

He did this whole no-talking thing that completely freaked our guy out.
I mean, he ended up telling us his entire life story just to get McGee to speak.
So cool.
What?
You really like McGee, don't you?
Yeah, bit of a man crush, you ask me.
It's a total man crush, yeah.
Also, it's like looking into a crystal ball to see what I could potentially become.
You know?

Well, where's future Sebastian now?
He's in Patton's office trying to track the final burner phone.
No luck so far, though.
It hasn't even been turned on.
Well, two of the other buyers were murdered, so maybe whoever has the other phone is dead, too.
Or he could be the killer, take out the competition for the Playbook.
Well, all we know about the killer is that he was wearing a Mardi Gras costume, and he's good with a knife.

Well, that's what I've been working on.
So, we have about ten seconds of surveillance video from the night Ferdinand Pisco was killed.
I'm using a special computer program to analyze the suspect's gait-- stride length, height, measurements.
It can even predict gender.

I'm gonna cross-check the results against our database, and hopefully come up with a viable suspect.
Yeah, well, keep at it, Past Sebastian.
Yeah.

Hey, Gregorio, you think you might bring up the Playbook anytime soon, or is that a like a second date type of question?
Do I disappoint?
Not in the least.
Honestly, Pride, how long are we gonna go on with the foreplay?
Gregorio, you might want to give her a push.
Well, let's talk business.
My employer is eager to make an offer.
I haven't decided if I'm entertaining an offer.
Well, what else do I have to do to convince you?

View of the Quarter.

Tenth floor, east side of the hotel.
You say the word, I'm on the move.
I didn't book the room because of the view.
Balcony gives me access to the roof.

Paranoid way of life.
Only way to survive in our line.
Gets tiring, though.
Why do it?
I've got my reasons.
Here's the Playbook.
Voice activation security needs my voice.
Have a look.
- Sebastian.

I just got a hit back on that gait analysis I was running.
What's gait analysis?
It's too complicated to explain right now.
Bottom line, we got an I.D. on our murder suspect.
Eva Azarova came back as a match.
Are you sure?
Program's not 100% accurate, but, yeah, I'm-I'm pretty damn sure.
Torres,
Gregorio's up there with our killer.
I got the room.
You cover the back in case she tries to escape.
Copy.
Gregorio, do you hear that?
Got confirmation that Eva's responsible for Ferdinand's murder.
I'm on my way, but you need to get out of there now.
Everything seems in order.

I know you're not Monica Grange, because I watched her die this morning.
I thought Victor may have sent you because you're definitely his type.
I don't even know who Victor is, but you got bigger problems 'cause you're pointing a knife at a federal agent.
Drop it!
Now!
Pride, I got the suspect in custody.
Copy that.

Pride?
You're NCIS.
Yeah.
And you're under arrest for espionage and the murder of Ferdinand Pisco and Monica Grange.
Well, you got me on espionage, but I didn't kill those people.
Oh, yeah?

Same person who just did that.
You hit?

Stay there.
Gregorio?
You okay?
Two gunmen went out the balcony.
They have the Playbook.
Torres, two suspects headed your way, armed.
Torres, do you copy?
Agent Torres is unable to respond.
Who is this?
The man you'll be negotiating with if you want Torres back alive.
Ask Eva what happens if you don't comply.
I'll expect your call.
Just got off the phone with Director Vance, who's ready to send the Marines down to get Torres back.
What do we know?

Torres and the Playbook were taken last night by three gunmen in a black SUV at the Roosevelt Hotel.
Sebastian and McGee are trying to track the movements of that SUV, but it seems like it vanished into thin air.
This Victor's good at what he does, whoever he is.
Well, Eva seems to know exactly who he is.
It's like she was expecting him last night.
He could be the fifth buyer, responsible for killing the others.
Yeah, laying in wait at the hotel last night to grab the Playbook.
But Eva was there when Ferdinand Pisco and Monica Grange were killed.

It's a lot of unanswered questions.
Like, is Torres even still alive?
Torres is alive because Victor needs him as a bargaining chip.
Well, Playbook can't be opened without Eva's voice verification.
And Eva's the one person who might be able to fill in the rest of the blanks for us.

Keep digging.
I was hoping that my new friend would join us.
I didn't catch her real name.
That's too bad.
Never would have guessed that she was a federal agent.
Plus, she has a mean right hook.
I'll let her know.
Right now, you need to tell me who Victor is.
Russian agent, vicious assassin, my mentor.
Taught me everything I know.
We think he's responsible... for these two murders.
Here we are again, Eva.
Yup.
You're accusing me of crimes I didn't commit.
But you did commit a crime.
You stole the Playbook from Homeland.
Sell to the highest bidder.
Never pegged you as an opportunist.
You're right.
I was using it as bait to draw Victor out.
Your mentor.
He recruited me when I was just a child.
He took me from my family.
He made me do...

He turned me into this.
Woman without a country.
I saw an opportunity to pay him back, 'cause I knew that he would come crawling out from under his rock if the Playbook was up for grabs.
It's too big a prize.
And then I would have justice.
Two people are dead because of your justice.
Victor has the Playbook and one of our agents.
You need me to get him back.
Trade me for your agent.
And we'll take Victor down together.
Well, problem is, the way you've acted... don't know how I can afford to trust you.
How can you afford not to?
Not sure we can take Eva at her word.
I'm sure we can't.
I know that look in her eyes.
She's hell-bent on revenge.

If I had a chance to take down my ex-husband after all the crap he pulled, nothing would stop me.
We need a plan B to get Torres and the Playbook back safely.
McGee and I might have what you're looking for.
Hey.
- Hey.

- Before it disappeared into thin air?

The SUV passed a number of cameras while it fled the scene.
Yeah, traffic cameras, security cameras, pedestrians' personal cameras...
If we can access that feed, we can piece together exactly where the SUV went.
We don't have the resources to consolidate footage from dozens of sources to find a single target.
The NSA does.
This case involves national security and international espionage.
I asked Bishop to call in some favors from her old bosses.
Yeah.

Lasalle and Percy, they're our boots on the ground while we gather Intel.
We're-we're gonna find Torres.
How legal is this, guys?
Well, strictly speaking, we're entering a bit of a gray zone.
One of my team was taken by a sociopathic Russian agent.
I say screw the gray zone.
We're with you, McGee.
If it'll get Torres back, get after it.
We need to buy them more time.
No way Victor's sitting around, waiting to get caught.
Well, there's only one way to keep Victor occupied while we search for him:

I'll call Torres's phone.
See if I can make contact with Victor.
I was beginning to lose hope you'd ever call.
So was Agent Torres.
Is he all right?

I'll let you have him back in return for my agent.
The only reason you want Eva back is to access the Playbook.
Does it really matter, with Torres's life on the line?
I want to speak to him.
Speak.
Pride.
You okay, Nick?
Well, my allergies are acting up 'cause of all this drywall, but the view of the parade route from here, it's, uh...

Just say you're fine.
I'm fine.
I'll send a text where to bring Eva for the trade.
Once I have her, I'll tell you where Torres is.
No, no, no, no.

Terms are non-negotiable.
There's 50 ways this goes south.
That's optimistic.

He wants us at the Huey P. Long Bridge in 20 minutes.
Keep this very simple, and you don't go off book.
Understand?
Victor's gonna go off book.
He's gonna double-cross you.

Yeah, well, that's why we have the tracking device.
Keep tabs on Victor.
Here I was thinking you were just looking for an excuse to get fresh.
Lasalle, what's the update?
Good news and bad news.
Sebastian and McGee were able to track down
Victor's SUV till its final destination.
- You got eyes on it?

It's parked outside an abandoned building in the CBD.
Bad news?
Well, the building's 30 stories tall.
Torres might be inside, and he might not.
It's gonna take time to search without alerting the Russians.
Yeah, well, time's something we're running out of.
Start searching.
I don't know about all this.
What, you worried about taking on some Russian spies who are probably armed to the teeth?
No.

Send Eva alone.
Two of you stay where you are.
Do what he says.
Be ready to take him out.
You'll be okay.
Eva, it's been too long.
Our turn now!
Where's Torres?
Once we're safely away, I'll text you the address.
Can't wait to catch up with you.
Play your cards right, you just might survive this mess.
But you will not, Victor.
What the hell did you just do?
Something I've been waiting for a long time.
You just killed the one person who could help us get Torres back.
You really screwed us here, Eva.
Victor's guys are waiting for his call.
Now they'll kill Torres.
He would've killed Torres anyway.

How's that?

He would've slit your agent's throat the minute we pulled away.
Wait, Lasalle and Sonja are already near Victor's hideout.

I got an idea.
But we're gonna need her help again.
She's stalling, but it's not gonna work for long.
What do you got?
I have a trace on the Russian's cell.
All right.

Getting the exact coordinates now.
There it is.

Guys, we got a hit!

Tell us where.
And tell us softly, please.
17th floor.
Northeast side.
You good?
I'm good.
What took you so long?
You do realize it was, like, 17 freakin' flights of stairs, right?
You know I had him, right?
Oh, yeah, you definitely had him.
Don't people usually just say thank you?
Oh, you're welcome.
Should we leave him tied up?
Yes.
Special Agent Torres.
Glad to see you survived your ordeal.
Managed to get yourself in the game.
I told you I hate riding the bench.
You did good, too.
Not bad for a couple of new guys, right?
Well, it's not six months in an Ecuadorian prison just to set up cover, but, uh, yeah, not bad.
Shoving off in five.
Beautiful night.
It'll be your last for a while.

They don't have a lot of night activities in federal prison.
Yeah, well, you should've thought about that before your little adventure.
Believe it or not, this is exactly how I thought it would all end.
And it was completely worth it.
Getting revenge was worth a lifetime in prison?
Meeting you was nice, too.
Too bad we won't be able to get to know each other a little better...
Never say never.
You sure you got to go?

Hasn't this been Mardi Gras?

This has been the lead-up to Mardi Gras.
Actual Mardi Gras day is when the city really goes off.
Oh.

Maybe next year.

Uh... you think it's okay if maybe I call you from time to time?
Yeah, sure.
The way you, uh, just asked me made it sound a little weird.
Well, you know, I just, I might need some advice.
Get Future Sebastian's wisdom.
Okay.

The fact is, you are Past McGee.
And doing a real good job of it.
Ah, there you are, McGee.
I just dropped some food off with Torres in the car.
- A little snack for the road.

Pleasure.

She's tricky.

- Jethro.

You'll be happy to know I'm sending your team home mostly in one piece.
Eh, you pulled it off on your own.

I'm just glad we kept all of official Washington from flooding the city.
Yeah.

Well, let's keep it that way.

Unless, of course, it's for a social visit.
Next time there's another party,
I might just pop down, surprise you, Dwayne.
This is New Orleans, my brother.
There's always another party going on.
