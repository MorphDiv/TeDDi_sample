(MUSIC PLAYING)
You're gonna be late for school.
I'm already dressed, Dad.
I'm practically out of the door.
Why don't I believe you?
Are you calling me a liar?
Well, that hurts.
To think that my father doesn't even believe his first-born child.
It's not a question of belief, Kevin, it's a question of experience, and in my experience...
Huh.
Well, I stand corrected.
Honestly, Dad...
I wish you'd learn to trust me once in a while.
Okay, I apologize.
And Dad, I need some cash for the class trip.
I thought I gave you money for a class trip last week.
It's for another class trip.
They must be running a travel agency out of your school.
Here.
Finish your homework?
Of course I finished my homework.
It's right in here.
Homework.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
I will be collecting your social studies assignment this morning.
You're late, Kevin.
It's not my fault.
I was helping Principal Taggert with a school safety issue.
And what safety issue would that be?
Sworn to secrecy.
Take a seat, Kevin.
As you know, this assignment is worth 30% of your final grade, so I hope you all took it very seriously.
Top-level security?
It's the best I could come up with on short notice.
One of these days, you're gonna get caught, you know.
Yeah?
Well, not today.
Thank you.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
Is there a problem, Miss Walker?
I'm not sure.
You wrote this paper all by yourself?
Stayed up all night, but it was worth it.
I really think I learned something important.
I think I better call your father to confirm that you actually did write this paper on your own.
Oh, I wouldn't do that, Miss Walker.
My dad's very busy, you know.
You really shouldn't bother him.
And I'm sure your father's interested in your education, of course.
Of course.
PRINCIPAL: (OVER PA) Happy Friday, kids.
We are pleased to inform you that we won't be serving plain, hot mush today.
It will be hot mush with applesauce and cinnamon.
Bon app√©tit.
What if Miss Walker wasn't kidding?
What if she really does call your dad?
Becca, I'm hurt.
You, of all people, don't believe I wrote that paper?
Right.
I know you didn't write that paper.
Then you also know I've got a plan.
(SIGHS)
(RINGING)
Wonder who this is.
This is Karen Walker, Kevin's social studies teacher.
Ah, yes.
He has?
He says you're one of the best teachers at the school.
Did Kevin stay up all night working on his social studies assignment?
He's been working quite hard on this paper for weeks.
I'd be very surprised if it didn't earn him at least an A.
Well, I will certainly, um...
By the way, are you calling all the parents today?
Well, no, it's just...
For crying out loud, cut the kid some slack.
(CALL DISCONNECTS) Goodbye...
Why did I ever doubt you?
The doctor said it's a very rare condition...
And any kind of extreme physical exertion could result in...
Kevin, I need to see you in my classroom.
It can't.
Plagiarism?
They have this wonderful new program called iCompare that correlates instances of selected texts against known sources on the Internet.
It could've been a coincidence.
Forty-seven times?
I'm afraid the odds are not in your favor, Kevin.
I didn't know what else to do.
Usually, I would have to report this to the principal, but I think, in this case, one-week suspension.
One month.
No Internet, no allowance, no phone, no video games and no car.
And, of course, I will need you to redo your assignment in your own words, and in your own handwriting this time.
(EXHALES)
No Internet?
Tomorrow's the last day of the semester.
I want your new assignment on my desk no later than 9:00 tomorrow morning.
Unless I come up with a completely new project,
I'm gonna be spending the entire summer stuck in some classroom with Miss Walker and a bunch of mouth-breathers.
Just pick a topic.
New technologies.
Trends in new technologies.
How am I supposed to write about new technologies if I can't even use my current technology?
They say you should write about what you know.
Well, you know how to lie.
Thanks.
Just trying to help.
A game.
But... (MUSIC PLAYING)
(ALARM BEEPING)
I'm done!
No!
What?
Nah, it was a total waste of time.
No-talent hacks at that stupid game expo couldn't come up with Ms. Pac-Man if you gave' em three ghosts on a plate.
Yeah, I'm on my way to the airport now.
If the guy could find the gas pedal!
I'll call you later.
So you're in the, uh, video game business?
Oh, let me guess.
You got a great idea for a game?
Nice guy-
Kevin Shepard, you're a genius.
(HORN HONKING) Oh!
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh, kid.
(GRUNTS) I think you broke my tibia.
Your tibia's in your leg.
Phantom pains!
Phantom pains!
We gotta get to the airport!
Well, what about my bike?
How am I supposed to get to school?
Isn't there a bus for you people?
I need to get to school now!
Look, give me a ride and I'll forget all about this clearly illegal hit-and-run.
Forget it, kid!
Thanks to Miss Daisy here, I'm already late for my flight.
My leg!
We'd better get a police report.
Someone call 911.
(GROANS)
All right!
He's kidding.
Where's your school?
Fourth and Maple.
Yes, Mr. Wolf.
(SIGHS)
So, what brings you to Columbus?
(SCOFFS)
I came here for the video game expo.
I was scouting for new talent for Highcroft Electronics, apparently wasting my time.
Wait.
Did you say Highcroft Electronics?
Have you heard of it?
Are you kidding?
Wow.
You must be a genius.
I'll accept that.
You know, I wrote a game.
But it's really good.
Yeah, yeah, read my lips.
I'm not interested in your stupid game here.
(EXHALES)
Hmm.
I guess we're here.
Yes, we are.
Hey, can I have my game back?
Hey, thanks for the ride.
But what about the kid's assignment?
(TIRES SCREECHING)
You seriously expect me to believe this?
Look, I know how it sounds...
Actually, Kevin, I don't think you do.
But I'm telling you the truth.
Okay, a lot!
But this time, you have to believe me.
Please!
Enjoy summer school, Kevin.
Economics.
The fundamentals of economics have remained unchanged for centuries, with the simple idea that supply and demand is the foundation of all commerce in all fashions all around the world, wherein, if supply equals "X" and demand equals
But if we are to understand that "Y" is greater than "X", we can invert the equation and reverse...
Yes!
Yes to economic theory?
Namaste.
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
(CHUCKLES)
Respect your center.
What?
That jerk stole my game!
His name is Larry Wolf, he's from Highcroft Electronics, and he took my social studies assignment.
Are we back to that lie again?
That means you're lying.
(SIGHS)
That hurts, Dad.
How do you think I feel, Kev?
I can't even trust my own son.
(CAR HORN HONKS)
(SIGHS)
Now, I'll be back from New York in three days.
This should tide you over till then.
(SIGHS)
And this is for emergencies only.
Your mom was always so proud of you, Kevin. (SIGHS)
I can't help but thinking how disappointed she'd be with all of this.
I know I am.
No more lies.
(LINE RINGING)
Yes, I'd like to speak to Mr. Larry Wolf in your Interactive division.
Can I ask who's calling, please?
My name is Kevin Shepard.
And, Mr. Shepard, what is this regarding?
It's regarding my game, Big Fat Liar, which he stole from me and...
Hello?
No, not until I talk to Wolf.
Do you know how many crank phone calls they must get there every day?
From people just like you, who say they had their idea for a game stolen?
You might as well forget it.
Okay.
I'm gonna go see him in person.
What?
He can't hang up on me when I'm standing in his office.
San Francisco is, like, 2,000 miles away.
My dad said for emergencies only.
So wait, you're just going to walk in there, all by yourself and try to meet this guy?
Give me one good reason why not.
(LAUGHS) I'll give you two.
My parents.
They'll never say yes to this.
So lie.
(SIGHS)
(VOCALIZING)
There's something I have to tell you.
I've decided I want to go to Yoga Camp.
(GASPS)
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
How's the new phone?
Highcroft Electronics, please.
There he is.
Where do you think you're going?
We're here to see Larry Wolf.
Uh-huh.
Got an appointment?
Not exactly, but he's going to want to talk to me.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sure he's been dreaming of this his whole life.
(SCOFFS)
Look, Jimmy, we've come a very long way for this meeting.
I would suggest you just call upstairs and let him know that Kevin Shepard is here.
Hi, Mr. Wolf?
It's Jimmy in the lobby.
I was hoping to get fired today for bothering you about a couple of snotty kids who don't have an appointment.
On second thought,
I'll keep my job.
Buh-bye.
Now what?
Be right back.
Go on up.
Mmm, go on up.
Yeah, go on up.
(BEEPING)
It's not supposed to freeze in the middle of the game?
(STAMMERS) It's still got a few bugs, but I'm sure once we get it up and running, you won't be able to put it down, Mr. Wolf.
No, no, I doubt that.
I do not play video games.
Video games are for losers with nothing better to do.
Uh...
If you don't like the games, why are you running the Interactive division?
Well, let me ask you something, Connie.
It's Kenny, sir.
Yeah, whatever.
Do you think that I like microwave ovens?
No, I don't.
Microwave ovens cook like crap, and they don't even get the popcorn setting correct.
But I spent five years in appliances.
Five long years.
I pioneered convection-roasting technology.
I introduced the FridgeMate TV system.
I tripled the revenue for that department.
I was a shoo-in to be president of this company.
Top-floor office.
Big pay raise.
A view.
You have a wonderful view, sir.
Oh.
Exactly.
I've worked for this company for 30 years.
I deserved to be president.
He gave the job to his grandson.
His idiot grandson!
I meant to say that.
Now, you listen to me.
I'm going to work you morons like rented monkeys until I turn this turd of a department into a winner.
Then I'm going to show them who should be president of this company!
Capisce?
Yup.
(MUMBLES) Hmm.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
(SIGHS)
Wait here.
He's going to have to call you back.
Delivery for Mr. Wolf.
Mr. Wolf asked for this to be hand-delivered to him.
Well, I'm Mr. Wolf's executive assistant.
I'm sure I can handle this.
My instructions were very specific, Penny.
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
(KEYPAD CLICKING)
Oh, Penny.
Just give it to me!
No!
Look, kid, it's just a pizza!
(PHONE RINGING)
Oh.
Mr. Wolf's office.
Hi, Penny, it's Mike.
Mike?
I had a really good time last night at, uh...
Olive Garden?
L need to see you again.
Can you meet me right away?
When?
I know it sounds crazy, but I have to see you.
I need to tell you how I feel.
Oh, Mike.
I think this could be the start of something very special.
I'm in the lobby.
I'll be right down.
Oh!
Thanks.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Don't worry, Mr. Wolf.
We'll do our best to see that Big Fat Liar launches on time.
Yeah, whatever.
The point is, is that if you don't fix this game,
I'm gonna see to it that you spend the rest of your pathetic life programming talking baby dolls till your ears bleed!
Penny!
She's on a date.
All right, everybody, get out.
Now!
Now!
So you do remember?
What do you want, kid?
Uh, money, credit and an apology.
Actually, no.
All I want is for you to call my dad and tell him the truth.
You want me to call your dad,
Daddy, and tell him that I, um, stole your idea?
Exactly.
Let me think about that.
Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
Mr. Wolf.
I think we both know you want to do the right thing.
(CHUCKLES)
Pretty much goes without saying that if I'm going to steal somebody's idea, which you have absolutely no proof of,
I'm probably not going to do the right thing.
You're making a big mistake.
Is that a threat?
(LAUGHS) Let me tell you something, kid.
I didn't get this far in the corporate snake pit by being intimidated, especially by some smart-ass kid.
So why don't you and Fly-Over Barbie here go back to Hooterville, where you belong?
I came up with Big Fat Liar, and I am never going to admit otherwise.
Oh, Mr. Wolf, I am so sorry.
Steroids, get these two out of my sight.
Yes, sir.
(SIGHS)
Hey!
Nice try with the phone.
Beat it.
Zip it.
Well, it was worth a shot.
If it's any consolation, I believed you all along.
Oh, this isn't over.
You don't have any proof, and he's not going to admit anything.
Not yet.
You bumped his phone?
Got all the data when it was in my pocket.
What kind of moron keeps his credit card numbers in his phone?
He could have done this the easy way.
But now, we're gonna do things my way.
Your father has arranged a pre-paid room, all expenses on his account.
Welcome to the Fairmont Nob Hill.
(SNAPS FINGER) Front!
Wow.
This is beautiful.
Tell me they have a minibar.
$50 for a cheeseburger?
Yeah, that's crazy.
We need to spend more money.
Let's go out for dinner.
Um, Kevin, I didn't exactly pack for going out.
Don't worry, we'll just put it on Larry Wolf's tab.
You know what?
We'll take them all.
How much is this going to cost?
Don't you think it's a bit ironic, trying to prove to your dad that you're telling the truth by lying, cheating, and stealing?
Really expensive caviar.
(CHUCKLES)
I told you, Wolf deserves it.
Not that, this.
I really don't mind sleeping on the couch if you want the bed.
Designed to maintain the status quo.
And feed the egos of cool kids in school.
Well, you can't dance, anyway.
Oh.
Well, you dance like a duck.
You move like you've got explosive diarrhea.
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)
Dance, Kevin, dance!
(LAUGHING)
You're going down!
(PHONE RINGING)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
I really think this is going to be a life-changing event.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
I'll be home in a couple days, but if you need anything, just let me, you know...
Hurry up.
Got it.
(SIGHS)
Send.
Good morning, Mr. Wolf,
May I arrange a car for you?
Thank you, Elliot.
You may.
Oh.
(SHOWER RUNNING)
WOLF: (SINGING) Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Figaro!
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro
(RINGS AND CHIMES)
(WHOOPS) Ah!
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(SIGHS)
Larry Wolf.
Yes, this is he.
Unusual charges?
No, those are all accounted for.
Just treating my little lady to a day in the city, if that's okay with you.
Yes, we might be making a few more big purchases.
Very big-
Are we in trouble?
So, you really Mr. Wolf's kids?
Yep.
Mr. Wolf has no kids.
We're the black sheep in the family.
The hotel, they called the company to arrange the limo.
Uh-oh.
I overheard you talking about using his credit card.
What are you up to?
Let me tell you a little story.
Before I drive limo, I used to work for Mr. Wolf.
You designed video games?
No, housewares.
I was the top engineer in the whole appliance division.
Ever heard of the FridgeMate?
The TV set built into the refrigerator?
That was me. (CHUCKLES)
I've always wondered why people wanted to watch TV standing in front of the fridge.
My point is, it was my invention, and then my boss, the Mr. Larry Wolf, he stole my idea and pretended it was his own!
I know the feeling.
Why didn't you say something?
But what would I say?
And when I confronted him on it, he reassigned me to the transportation department, and he said if I ever complained, he would blacklist my name all over town!
(SPITS)
Why are you telling us all this?
Because, I can tell that you two are up to something, and if it involves causing any Hooterville to Mr. Wolf,
I'm in.
According to his schedule, he's in meetings all day.
So, he won't be home.
The perfect time to drop by his house for a little visit.
And then we kill him, hmm?
Suit yourself.
(SIGHS)
Tomorrow, you have your meeting with Mr. Highcroft at 2:00...
And then you're being interviewed by the TV station at 3:00.
Those bozos better have Big Fat Liar ready, 'cause if Highcroft finds out, we're in trouble.
He'll pull the plug on this whole thing.
I want Dopey and his Short Bus Team here all night.
Hmm?
I want that game checked and double-checked till it's good to go, you got that?
All night, sir?
"Top priority."
I've got this.
Let me try.
(BEEPING)
Key code, 555-55-55.
Clever.
(ALARM BEEPING)
What do we do?
Alarm code, 555-55-55.
(CHUCKLES) At least he's consistent.
(ALARM STOPS)
Let's just look around a bit first, okay, Ivan?
Okay, whatever.
(TYPING)
Anything interesting?
He's downloaded every episode of My Little Pony.
Even the Christmas special?
I'll just take everything and sort it out later.
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
Hey.
Look at these.
We got him.
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)
Oh, he's got mu-sh...
I've hidden the car.
Did you get the stuff?
You must never question Ivan.
Skin bleach.
(CHUCKLES)
(GATE RATTLING)
He's here.
Game on.
(CAR ALARM CHIRPS)
(ALARM BEEPING)
(ALARM STOPS)
(MIMICS BLENDER)
Ah...
Hmm.
(PANTS)
Mmm.
(TREADMILL BEEPS)
Every day I'm getting faster, stronger.
Every day I'm getting faster, stronger.
Every day I'm getting faster, stronger.
Every day I'm getting faster...
Every day I'm getting faster, stronger.
Maybe we didn't use enough.
(MUMBLES)
(GRUNTS)
I think we used enough.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Let's get to work.
(GRUNTING)
(URINATES) (SIGHS)
(SCREAMING)
(SCREAMING)
That kid!
It's that kid!
(GRUNTING)
(PHONE RINGING)
Mr. Wolf's office.
It's about his meeting today with Mr. Wolf.
(PANTING)
(BLUBBERING)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
What?
He'd like to meet you for lunch instead.
I'm trying to find your day-planner to see if that'll work...
Did you want me to tell him you're unavailable?
(WOLF EXCLAIMS)
Are you sure you're up for this meeting?
What is that supposed to mean?
You just sound a little odd.
(PANTING)
I'm fine.
Everything's fine!
(CAR ALARM CHIRPS)
(ENGINE STARTING) (HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Huh?
(GRUNTING)
(HORN HONKING)
Kevin Shepard, I'm going to kill you!
(HONKING CONTINUES)
(HONKING AND MUSIC CONTINUE)
Shut the hell up, you moron!
I got your license plate, Hooterville!
So sue me!
Officer, did you see that?
Please put your hands where I can see them, sir.
Oh, no, I got a meeting I got to get...
(SIGHS) Ah, it's in the glove compartment.
Cirque do Soleil in town?
What's this?
These are the blueprints for the bank over on 17th Street.
Gun!
Better put out an APB for any mimes carrying concealed weapons.
(KEVIN CHUCKLES)
We are.
It's just, I feel bad about lying to my parents.
Besides, it makes life interesting.
It makes me interesting.
You don't need a lie to do that.
I guess, after my mom died, it just seemed easier to make up stuff than it was to have to face the truth.
I just sort of got used to it.
Well, I don't want to get used to it.
(LAUGHS) Like you've never lied to your parents before?
Once.
You remember that time we snuck out and went to the Midnight Madness movies?
You never told me that.
I didn't want to make you feel bad, but I got in big trouble.
I told them I snuck out alone.
Because, dummy, uh...
You're my best friend.
And that's the truth.
But I had to explain to accounting why I needed bail money!
Mr. Wolf, I don't understand why you had bank blueprints, and a mask, and a gun!
It wasn't a real gun!
Officer.
Mr. Wolf!
Well, you have been acting very suspicious lately.
Yes, sir.
Does it have anything to do with your face, sir?
Oh, shut up, Penny!
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.
Go back to France, creep!
I'm not from France!
(HORN HONKING) (HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Would you open it?
Idiot!
Well, you're welcome!
(SIGHS)
You're kidding.
Okay.
(MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS)
Oh.
(GAGS)
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
(GRUNTS)
(MUSIC STOPS)
Go, Niners!
I'm looking for a man named Highcroft.
I think you're in the wrong place, freakshow.
Are you threatening me because I'm wearing makeup?
Because I look like a mime?
Because I'm just a little bit different?
I thought this was America.
I thought...
(EXHALES)
(GAGS)
I thought we were supposed to accept people, no matter what they look like.
(SNIFFS)
I mean, after all, I don't get on your case when you get a little drunk and try to get romantic with a squid.
(CHUCKLES)
No, I do not.
I mean, in my book.
What you people do on the high seas stays on the high seas!
Am I right?
Who's with me?
So, you give up yet?
It was you?
What'd you do to my face?
Careful, Wolfie.
They don't care much for mimes around these parts.
(GRUNTS)
I mean, you got me with your little sophomoric prank, right?
But, big picture?
Where's my car?
(SIREN WAILING)
(ALL LAUGHING)
Taxi!
(VOCALIZES) ls he here yet?
'Cause I don't want that little toad running off to his grandpa, telling him...
Miss Wise, I don't have time to sit around and waste...
For that new carnival game that we have in development.
(VOCALIZING)
You look completely stupid.
All right, I'm here to see Big Fat Liar.
What do you have to show me?
(CHUCKLES)
So, we're all set for the big launch tomorrow, right, Kelly?
"Kenny." Kenny.
What is this crap?
I know what beta-testing means, Wolf!
Look, I am sick of your excuses.
We have millions committed to the marketing campaign on this.
Get out of my way!
I'm sure that we can...
I want to see this game up and running by 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.
Otherwise, I pull the plug on Big Fat Liar and you.
(GRUNTS)
I don't even know what that means!
Well, we worked on it all night.
You know they lock the bathrooms after 6:00 p.m.?
I had to pee in the sink.
You know, I have to be on television in one hour to promote a game that doesn't exist!
Would you like me to call and cancel?
Never mind.
Now, you listen to me, you little mud weasel.
I want you to go back to work and fix that game, because if it goes down, I go down, and if I go down, I'm not going down alone.
Tell maintenance to rip that sink out.
Did you get it?
Why do they call it a "ghost pepper"?
Maybe because nobody who eats one lives long enough to warn you not to.
So Judy's going to ask you a few questions about the game, and then we'll show some screen shots to tell the story.
That sound okay?
Sounds great.
What exactly happened to your face, anyways?
I don't know.
What happened to yours?
(LAUGHS)
(BOTH LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)
More eyebrows.
The other one.
I'm Jeff.
I'm an intern at Highcroft Electronics, and I'm totally embarrassed, but I forgot to give Mr. Wolf his energy drink before he left the office.
I don't think I could take him yelling at me again today.
Poor kid.
(VOCALIZING)
A-E-I-O-U.
Almost forgot your energy drink.
(BELL RINGS)
Welcome back, everyone.
We are here now with Larry Wolf, VP of Interactive and...
President of Interactive at Highcroft Electronics.
Well, ifs nice to be here.
About to release its highly anticipated game, Big Fat Liar, tomorrow, to what is sure to be a media extravaganza.
We are very excited about it.
Yes, now, I have to admit, we were all a little miffed here that we didn't get a chance to play the game ourselves.
We are keeping this game under lock and key.
There have been some development issues...
Come on, come on!
No, we're just not releasing a review copy of the game because it's too exciting.
(LAUGHS) We just want everybody to be surprised by it.
Okay, well, that sounds fantastic.
Surely, you can tell us a little bit about the game, though.
I can't.
Is it first-person shooter?
Shoo... (GRUNTING)
(KEVIN CHUCKLING)
It's a... (VOCALIZING)
(MUMBLING)
Uh, maybe... (ALL LAUGHING)
Mr. Wolf?
Wolf, are you okay?
(GRUNTS)
Yes!
(SPLUTTERS)
(GRUNTING)
(GARGLING)
(YELLING)
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Serves you right, Wolf.
We'll be right back.
Well, Mr. Highcroft called.
(STUTTERS) I tried to tell him it was some sort of allergic reaction.
And?
He wants you to see the company psychiatrist as soon as you get out.
(EXHALES)
I'm afraid not.
No one seems to be able to make it stop freezing up.
(SNORING)
Why am I not in a private room?
I wish there was something that I could do to help, I really do.
You can barely type a letter.
There's only one person who can help me now.
So let me get this straight.
I help you fix the game, and then you'll call my dad to explain everything?
Well, what's to prevent you from not honoring your side of the bargain?
What's to prevent you from doing the same?
I'm just asking for your help.
This baby was your brainchild.
Please.
I need you.
It needs you.
You have my word.
You can't do this.
Do we have a deal?
(CHUCKLES)
(ALL GROANING)
(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)
What do you think?
(GRUNTS)
(MUSIC STOPS)
You made me lose.
(SIGHS)
Pretty cool, Wolf.
Pretty cool.
Mmm.
I'll see you at the launch tomorrow.
You know, kid, I gotta admit, you really saved my butt.
Well, maybe next time, you should get that handshake in writing, huh?
I knew it.
You know, when I first met you,
I really thought you were something.
All you really are is a big, fat liar.
Ooh... (SIGHS)
That hurts.
I'll remember that when I'm moving into my new office on the top floor.
Steroids, make sure that they get on the plane this time.
(CHUCKLES)
Well, be sure to mention that while you're filing for unemployment insurance.
Okay, so what's the plan now?
The plan is we go home.
Yeah, but the only way he did was by lying.
Exactly.
I don't want to be that guy anymore, Becca.
I don't want to end up some sad little man in clown makeup who has to lie and steal from a kid just to get ahead.
I don't want to lie anymore.
I want my dad to be proud of me.
I want to be proud of myself.
Anyway, thanks for coming with me.
It was fun, even if we didn't get we what came for.
You know what?
Maybe we did.
What do you mean?
I'm proud of you, Kevin.
It'll just be a minute.
My, you two certainly racked up the bill.
Hi, Jimmy.
Mr. Wolf called and said that I should take over from here.
Really?
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
Well, I was thinking about delivering some payback to my soon-to-be ex-boss.
Do you know of anybody who would like to help me?
It's too late for that.
Yeah, we're going home.
So, what, you're just gonna let Mr. Wolf take advantage of you?
You're not gonna stand up for yourself and do what's right?
I just don't want to lie anymore.
I'm not talking about lying.
I'm talking about making somebody finally tell the truth.
(SIGHS)
Hmm.
(ENGINE STARTS)
Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?
Appliances.
Oh, no.
What are you, crazy?
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
You know, we can talk about this!
No, too late for talking.
Oh!
Ah!
(EXCLAIMING)
NO, no!
Hey!
(YELLS)
(TIRES SQUEALING)
Call office!
Larry Wolf's office.
I'm in the back of a limousine.
Phase one is in progress.
Copy.
Bravo team, move into position.
I don't want money.
What do you want?
I want credit for my invention.
And full health insurance and dental.
(CHUCKLES) No problem.
You only get 10% off of frames and lenses, and nothing off of contacts.
You know, it's a huge rip...
Well, 10% isn't too bad.
Yeah, I'll pay for the rest of it myself, out of my own pocket.
We got a deal?
No deal.
Looks like you're going to miss your big launch party.
(LAUGHS EVILLY)
(DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS)
Ivan?
(TRAIN HORN BLARING IN THE DISTANCE)
No... (GASPS)
Get me out of here!
Need some help?
All you have to do is tell my dad the truth.
Just admit you stole my idea.
I stole Big Fat Liar.
(TRAIN HORN CONTINUES BLARING)
(WHIMPERING)
(CRYING) I'm gonna die!
(DEVICE BEEPS) I'm gonna die.
You've got a good team working for you, Wolf.
You really should treat them better.
(GRUNTING)
Kid.
Wait!
Hey, kid!
Hey, kid!
Hey!
You idiot!
(PANTING)
Watch your blood pressure.
(GRUNTING)
Stay down there!
You idiot!
You can't outrun the Wolf.
(PANTING)
Oh...
Oh, I'm sorry for the interruption, folks.
(CHUCKLES)
Out of the way, toad.
Lights.
You're not here for that.
(CROWD LAUGHS)
You're not here for that.
No, you're hereto witness the evolution of mobile gaming.
An evolution, may I say a revolution, that I championed here at Highcroft Electronics, long before this new regime ever took over.
So, ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce
Big Fat Liar!
Every day I'm getting faster, stronger.
Every day I'm getting faster and stronger.
Every day I'm getting faster, stronger.
(ALL LAUGHING)
I'm gonna work you morons like rented monkeys until I tum this turd of a department into a winner.
I'm gonna see to it that you spend the rest of your pathetic life programming talking baby dolls till your ears bleed!
Gotcha!
Well, that explains the underwear.
Video games are for losers with nothing else to do.
Turn it off!
Turn it off now, or you're all fired, you idiots!
Kid, the truth is overrated, all right?
You gave me your stupid little paper in the backseat of my car, and I stole it!
You happy now?
God, I'm gonna die!
How did you get that?
I just destroyed your phone.
There's this new thing these days called "email."
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
You know, for the head of an interactive division, you really don't know too much about technology.
Mr. Highcroft, I can explain.
You have 15 minutes to clear out your desk.
Jimmy?
Looks like nobody believes anything you say anymore.
Ah!
Et tu, Jimmy?
(LAUGHS)
So Big Fat Liar was your idea?
Yes, sir.
Well, then show them.
I'm proud to introduce my...
Big Fat Liar.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(CACKLING)
Dad?
Congratulations, son.
Becca called her parents, and her parents called me, and, well, here we are.
Dad, I'm so sorry.
We can talk about that later, but right now, I think they want you.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)
Kevin, I'm so proud of you.
(WHISTLES)
It was actually designed by high-school student
Kevin Shepard, who I'm proud to announce will be interning for us next summer.
Yeah, Dad?
Do you have any idea how much that cost?
You can take it out of my royalty check.
Sales for the gaming industry are up 12% this year based on...
Uh-huh.
New graphics chip set, sales are expected to climb well into Christmas.
(GRUNTING LOUDLY)
Something very heavy at the end of this rope!
It's a large rock!
Here, I'm gonna pick it up.
(CONTINUES GRUNTING)
(EXCLAIMING)
That's where the money goes!
(IMITATES WIND WHOOSHING)
That's where the money goes!
I'm in a glass box.
You suck.
I don't go to your job and show you how to use the plunger, do I?
(GRUNTING LOUDLY)
No, I don't!
I'm in a box, a glass box.
Is there a teddy bear in the room?
You know, I wouldn't bother...
(CHUCKLES) There it is.
(CREW LAUGHING)
No, not good.
Uh-huh. (CHUCKLES) One more.
KEVIN: when I'm standing in his office.
(CREW EXCLAIMS)
Lady!
(CREW LAUGHS)
This turned into a one-act play!
First of all, this was unplugged.
A mark.
(CREW CHATTERING) (BECCA LAUGHS)
Good morning!
Can I sit here?
Perfect. is that okay for you?
Mark it, baby.
I know, I looked at her for a second, and then I looked away.
She can't wait to be done with me.
Come back.
(LAUGHS)
(CREW LAUGHING)
And that, my darlings, is a wrap.
