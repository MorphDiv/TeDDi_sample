Man:

There's something on the roof.
Something big.
Oh, shit!
What the fuck was that?
Anybody out there?
Look, I don't play that Michael Myers shit!
I got a .45 and a crucifix!
I go to friendship baptist church!
Look, man, I'm coming right now!
Hey, I see you!
Devon!
Devon:

Jamal:

Shit.
Jesus, Jamal.
You okay?
You were supposed to hit the stunt pad, bro.
Jamal:

I'd have cracked my damned ass, shit.
I think your ass is already cracked.
Jamal:

Yeah, come here.
How'd you miss that?
Jamal:

It's huge!
Did you at least get the shot?
Jamal:

Of course you did.
Let's go post it online, scare the shit out of people.
Devon:

Bye, Jamal!
See ya!
Jamal:

Yo, Dev, man, check out the hit count.
Devon:

Hey, the channel's blowing up.
The more videos we post, the more hits we get across the line.
Even that grainy shit we filmed back in the day.
Jamal:

All those views, that's all money right there, baby!
But you know...
Jamal:

We can make more.
Jamal:

You already know I'm with that.
What if we turn this into a show?
We go out looking for real monsters.
Jamal:

You do know monsters ain't real.
It doesn't matter if they're real or fake.
People will watch.
And they'll want to believe it's real.
Jamal:

Yeah, what's up?
Jamal:

Check what out?
Jamal:

I'm telling you, bro, man, you're gonna like this name.
Devon:

Jamal:

Bang bang.
Devon:

Hey, I couldn't figure nothing else, man.
Blair witch was already taken.
Jamal:

Devon:

Check it out.
Attention all monsters in the Los Angeles area, looking for subjects to be interviewed for a documentary titled...
Jamal:

Okay.
Actors do not submit.
Serious inquiries only.
If you suffer from legitimate conditions like clinical lycanthropy and renfield's syndrome or believe that you are inflicted by the supernatural or paranormal, call the number below.
No age or ethnicity requirements.
Jamal:

Hey, mom, dad.
Um, this is video log 237, so you know what that means.
Two hundred thirty single days sober.
It'll be 240 on my birthday.
Got the money transfer you sent, thanks again.
I'm still waiting on some new jobs
I applied for.
Trying to put the pieces back together.
Been going to aa meetings at the church.
Actually, the pastor tonight told us about this old story.
Inside all of us there's this battle between duals.
One is good, love, you know, bravery.
And the other is evil, you know, fear, guilt, jealousy, and addiction.
When I asked him, which one wins, he said, the one that you feed, which made me think about myself.
And I still feel...
Hey, Bry.
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

Murielle:

No, I was just wrapping up.
Come and say hi.
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Jay.
Don't worry, me and Jamal, we got your boy's birthday covered this year.
We'll film the whole party and send you the highlights.
I need you to move your car.
I'm off to set Colton's and 30.
What, are they finally going to let you direct?
Now we'll see when that happens.
Will you cast me when you're famous?
Yes.
I'll let you finish up.

All right.
I guess it's rude to keep a beautiful girl waiting so, uh, one day at a time.
I'll see you tomorrow at 200 and 38.
Bye.
It's day one on our search for monsters.
Right now we are heading east of la to an Indian reservation to meet up with a guy who claims to be a skinwalker.
Jamal:

Basically.
Jamal:

It says "no trespassing."
Do you really think we should be here?
Yo, I'm running out of breath.
We've walked like ten feet.
How are you out of breath?
Jamal:

Devon:

Jamal:

Hello, I'm black?
Wait, wait, did you hear that?
Jamal:

That is the sound of me fucking with you.
Jamal:
I fucking hate you.
I wish something will bite you in the ass.
Hey, Dev.
The light's blinkin'.

You don't have any spares?
Jamal:

Devon:

Jamal:

Devon:

Steven:

Jamal:

He's not mad.
Oh, and he's mad.
Aw, damn.
Here it comes.
Did you get any of that conversation?
Jamal:

Do not fuck up on me again, Jamal.
Jamal:

Fuck.
Jamal:

I mean, you did get your skinwalker and, I gotta admit, he does look legit.
Oh, he's legit.
Devon:

Jamal:

Devon:

Jamal:

You know which house it is.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back up, back up.
Why?
Jamal:

What the hell is the problem?
Jamal:

She was supposed to be out by 9:00.
Aw, shit, turn the lights off.
Devon:

How old are we?
We've work to do!
Jamal:

I thought that meant you were going to kick my ass?
Jamal:

Look, you and me, we're cool, but you and Murielle, that's a whole other story.
She holds grudges.
She still hasn't forgave you for leaving.
I came back to Cali.
Jamal:

Oh, shit, there she go, duck, duck, get low.
Well, welcome back to my crib, Dev!
That's new.
Jamal:

What's up, Bry?
What you cooking?
It's, uh, dinner.
Jamal:

I didn't think you'd be back so soon.
Hey, you, uh, you got a package.
Jamal:

Devon:

I'm, uh, Bryan.
Sorry, we haven't met.
I'm Devon.
What, Devon?
What, the Devon?
Jamal:

Yeah, sorry, just heard that you moved away.
Yeah, I got back about a month ago.
Jamal:

Really?
Jamal:

Murielle...
Stay the fuck out of my life.
Jamal:

No.

Don't you think you should work somewhere else, I mean?
What are you, her boyfriend?
Jamal:

You know, this, gotta have respect for this house he's in.
Jamal:

Ooh, and good, too!
We got another response to the casting notice.
Jamal:

And she's a vampire.
Oh, shit, what, like a sexy Dracula?
She didn't attach a photo to her email, but her bio was convincing enough.
Her name is Shayla.
She's a tattoo artist so she works at night and sleeps during the day.
And get this, she drinks blood.
Jamal:

Oh, this kind.
Jamal:

Yo, you are trippin'.
You order needles off the Internet?
She says we can do the interview in exchange for a vial of blood.
So I'm gonna need your arm.
Jamal:

A hundred bucks.
Jamal:

I ain't that damn broke.
Well, you know anybody who is that damn broke?
You know, I can't believe I'm doing this.
Jamal:

Listen, you left Detroit and came to la to be an actor, right?
Well, just look at this as your first on-camera gig.
Bryan:

A guy with a needle in his arm.
Jamal:

It already pays better than most Hollywood acting gigs.
Devon:

Now let's go catch a vampire.
Jamal:

She said to leave it on a park bench near a swing set.
Well, there's kind of a lot of park benches there.
Devon:

Jamal:

Man, just put it down.
Okay.
Jamal:

Devon:

Jamal:

Jamal:

Devon:

Jamal:

Devon:

Did you get it on camera?
Why do you guys want to go looking for this again?
Monsters?
Jamal:

What, demons, vampires?
Look, I don't think we should be going looking for those things.
Devon:

Jamal:

The Bible says that demons are real, so if they're real then who's to say what else is out there in the dark?
I mean, evil seeps through the cracks of society and it targets vulnerable people.
So who's to say that the devil hasn't transcended in different ways?
Jamal:

Oh, my gosh, what is up, this door?
Who is it?
Bryan:

Jamal:

Yo, that better not be one of your drunk ass friends.
Yo, why are you banging on the door?
What the f...
What, what is that?
"Shiori"?
Dude, what took you so long?
Is it safe for me to be here?
Jamal:

Sit down, you gotta see this shit!
The DVD's in, just press play!
Hello.
My name is Shiori.
I need help.
I must have caught something.
Something is inside me.
Tells me to do things.
Bad things.
My parents don't understand.
They're scared of what I am.
Are you afraid?
Jamal:

Hell no, hell no!
Did you see that shit?
Devon, I know you've seen that shit!
What the fuck?
Whoa.
Hi, is this Shiori?
Jamal:

Would you keep your voice down?

Jamal:

Shut up!
Hi, this is Devon Adams, the producer of the monster project.
I'm sorry to call so late, I just finished watching your DVD and if you're still interested in...
That's correct.
Perfect.
Jamal:

Some things you just shouldn't go looking for?
That girl's one of them.
Oh, spare me, you're going to take life advice from the deadbeat bumming off your blow-up mattress?
Kid's a parasite.
Jamal:

Bryan's seen some real evil in his life.
Yeah, I saw the track mark scars on his arm when I drew his blood.
Kid's a junkie, too.
Jamal:

He just got out of rehab a couple of months back.
Once a junkie, always a junkie.
Didn't you see requiem for a dream?
They don't beat it.
Jamal:

I hope he didn't hear us.
Happy birthday!
We love you!
We hope you love your present!
Jamal:

When I say "happy", ya'll say "birthday"!
Happy!
That's my guy, yeah!
Hey, hey, watch your lips, boy.
Hey, that was my wish.
Murielle:

I've done worse things.

Jamal:

Jamal:

Are you serious?
Jamal:

Looks like some bullshit going down.
Hey, I think I might have a little talk with Bryan.
Say what up to your folks, bro!
Do we have to do this now, man?

Jamal:

How many days are we at now?
You know how many days, I live with you.
Two hundred and forty.
Jamal:

I'll definitely drink to that.
Couldn't be more proud.
Oh, my god, I almost forgot your present.

Present?
Bet you got nothing to do with that either, huh?
Jamal:

It was all my idea.
So she gets me a cake and a present and what do you get?
Jamal:

Anyways, 240 days and you ain't blown yet?
I don't know about that, bro.
What, you think I'm lying?
Nah, I'm just curious, 'cause I've seen your homeboy slip something in your pocket.
Yeah.
See, everyone should have one on their birthday.
Extra large, shouldn't be much.
I've seen yours, those purple small ones, so...
Jamal:

My bad, bro.

You know, I heard you and Devon talking about me behind my back.
What, that...
Parasite?
Jamal:

No, but you didn't defend me either.
You know, you're different around him.
You know he's only using you, right?
Jamal:

Yeah, to get to Murielle.
Jamal:

Hey, why did you invite him to my birthday?
Jamal:

What are you talking about?
Right fucking behind you.
Jamal:

Shit!
Oh, Devon, what are you doing here?
Relax.
I don't plan on staying.
I just came to apologize.
What's this?
My apology.
Oh, a birthday card?
Is this 600 dollars?
For one day of work.
Jamal:

Well, it's not your birthday, is it?
Jamal:

Look, I'm man enough to admit when I'm wrong.
What I said the other night was uncalled for.
And if you're interested, we can use a pa for the shoot on Sunday, someone to hold the boom pole.
Murielle:

Are you fucking kidding me?
Out front now.

Jamal:

Think you can just waltz in and out of my life whenever you fucking please?
That is not how this works.
And tonight of all nights is not about you.
Then why are you back here talking to me?
Go back to your boyfriend's party.
Bryan is my friend, something you never were.
We were more than friends.
Until you threw me away like a piece of trash.
But I guess the other bitch wasn't worth it.
Why else would you come crawling back?
Hey, I never cheated on you.
I just needed to get the hell out of la, to focus, to come up with a plan.
Too bad I wasn't a part of it.
I want you to be now.
Time apart taught me that.
This project Jamal and I started, it has potential.
I want you there with me.
You are fucking insane, if you think I would ever grip on my ex-boyfriend's shoot.
I'm not asking you to grip.
What then?
I'm asking you to direct.
Murielle:

I think Jamal is in his room hiding from you.
And I'm pretty sure that everybody else is gone.
Murielle:

I guess that means you had a good time.
I still haven't got my present, as you know.
Oh fuck, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...
Jamal and I got you a head-strap camera so you can film yourself falling off your skateboard.
I never fall off my skateboard.
Murielle:

I do it like a swan.
Murielle:

So, what, has this been recording the whole time?
Confess your sins.
I turned it on to film your reaction when I brought it out.
Didn't expect Devon to be here.
There, super dork.
Bryan:

You haven't seen yourself.
Bryan:

I saw your guys...
Yeah, it's broadly on tape.
Suffice it to say, he offered me a job.
Bryan:

So you gonna take it?
It's like I see exactly what he's doing, but I still can't say no.
Bryan:

Gave me 600 dollars.
Really?
Bryan:

Yep.
Definitely still an ass.
Bryan:

No, no, no, no, no, we're not getting back together.

I don't even, I was just saying.

There's a lot of history there.
Bryan:

Yeah.
Yeah, we do.
I'm sorry, uh, I shouldn't have.
Fuck, I am going to go to bed, um.
Are you gonna come inside?
Bryan:

Good night, Bryan.
Happy birthday.
Bryan:

You're a fucking coward, man.
Radio announcer:

You may not have been aware that this was even happening.
Tell us all about...

I brought my telephoto lens so we can check the eclipse up close.
Don't tell me, tell the director.
Jamal:

Devon, this is still your project.
And I will still be the one in front of the camera and Murielle will just handle everything behind it.
Murielle:

I thought that was my job.
Your job is to keep the fucking batteries charged this time.
Not fair.

And what are you laughing at, Mr. pa?
You still on the bottom of the chain.
Yeah, except I'm still making more money than you are.
Jamal:

I need a raise.
I'm sorry, man.

Jamal:

Devon:

That's the house.
Murielle:

Devon:

Jamal:

He's the property owner.
We only spoke over the phone a few times.
Bryan:

Jamal:

Bryan:

Devon:

Tonight will be perfect.
Murielle:

Devon:

Murielle:

Murielle:

Do you mind looking like a dork for the rest of the day?
The extra footage could come in handy in the edit.
Bryan:

Thank you.
Are you guys, you filming?
Jamal:

Nah, nah, I don't like cameras.
Bryan:

Now is really not the time, Bryan.
Besides, there's nothing to talk about.
What do you mean, there's nothing to talk about?
You kissed me.
Yeah, I was drunk and I was upset and you were nice to me.
It was a mistake.

You were drunk and I was just there, really?
Please don't do this.
Look, you're one of my best friends.
Don't ruin what we already have, okay?
Bryan:

Murielle:

Jamal:

Richard:

A lot of people sneak in, have sex, shoot up, sacrifice animals.
The security in this place costs more than the damn house is worth.
Murielle:

Yeah, in the '60s this was part of a headquarters for a satanic group.
Is this guy fucking serious?
Devon:

Murielle:

I don't want it interrupting the interviews or creating audio feedback.
Murielle:

You can live without it for a few hours.
It won't kill you.
Murielle:

Jamal:

Jamal:

Murielle:

Jamal:

Richard:

Murielle:

Richard:

Sorry, you talking to us?
Jamal:

Murielle:
You guys stay right here, okay?
She has some times that's really scary.
Martha!
Jamal:

Richard:

I think he said it was his wife.
Jamal:

Big brother's watching us.
Come on, come on, come on.
Ma'am?
Jamal:

I think we found your old lady.
Devon:

- Devon:

Murielle:

Yeah, you know what?
You can get out of the way and let me show you the rest of the place, okay?
You're going to just interview people, right?
Devon:

Devon:

All right, listen, I don't want anyone going upstairs, okay?
Especially up in the attic, because there's a lot of rotten wood up there.
Devon:

Okay, and if anybody gets hurt...
You know, I'm not liable for it.
Murielle:

Yeah, all the, uh, fixtures work and there's a fuse box downstairs in case you want to do the power.
Murielle:

Richard:
It's okay, it's okay.
Sorry, she, uh, she gets confused sometimes where she is.
She gets scared too, so...
Listen, I'm going to take off and get her to her doctor's appointment.
You have my, uh, house number.
Devon:

Try not to burn the place down.
Devon:

Hey, Jamal, can you move that diva left a little?
Jamal:

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I gotcha.
Murielle:

Damn.
Jamal:

Devon:

Murielle:

Devon:

Jamal:

Got that necklace around your neck.
Will you toss me a mag light?
All right, which one of you turkeys wants to come flip the breaker with me?
Gobble gobble.
Hey, no offense, man.
I'll take care of this one.
Ready?

You know, I don't need you to protect me from him.
Bryan:

I'm not an idiot.
He says he's changed.
Bryan:

What if nobody ever gave you a second chance?
Bryan:

Found it.
Jamal:

We all love a good horror story.
We like to pretend the monsters are real, but what if they truly exist, living amongst us?
Hi, my name is Devon Adams, creator of the monster project.
Tonight, on this rare lunar eclipse, we will interview three strangers who claim to be real-life monsters, a vampire, a demon, and a skinwalker.
No actors, no scripts, everything you are about to witness is real.
Cut, man, take it back.
My voice was off.
Jamal:

Oh, shit, what is that?
You heard that?
We don't have much time.
Shit.
Jamal:

Murielle:

Shiori, uh, early.
But we're not quite set up yet.
Would you mind waiting in your dressing room?
We, we don't mind.
Devon:

Who the hell is we?
I'm going to take Shiori to the storeroom.
Go tape these upstairs.
Bryan:

What am I doing?
All right, it's just one day.
Be professional, you don't need the pills.
All right, skinwalker.
Come on, all right.
We got demon.
All right, done.
Hello?
Anyone in there?
Hello?
Shiori?
You okay?
Shiori?
Everything okay?
Shit.
Devon:

Jamal:

Devon:

Jamal:

What?
Jamal:

I think I see something.
Yo, Dev, come over here, you gotta see this!
What is it?
Will you let me in?
Jamal:

Devon:

You must be Shayla.
In the flesh.
Devon:

Thank you for joining us.
Thank you for your donation.
I've come by for a second taste.
Jamal:

You look pale as fuck!
What was that for?
Just give me that...
Fuck, you don't need those fucking pills, just breathe, okay?
Just breathe and you'll be all right, you can handle one night.
Shit!
All right, fuck this.
Fuck it.

Steven:

Shit.
Steven:

What are you talking about?
Steven:

They make us wear bodycams now, too.
Oh, yeah, no, I just got mine today.
Steven:

Yeah.
Steven.
I'm so happy you could join us.
The monster project, scene one, take one.
Devon:

And set.
Thank you for joining us, Steven.
I understand you wish to conceal your identity for your protection.
Not my protection.
Yours.
I also understand it's forbidden for the Navajo to discuss skinwalking.
How would your people feel if they knew you were talking to us?
There would be an uproar.
Devon:

Revenge.
Aren't you a police officer?
On the reservation.
Devon:

From myself.
From others like me.
Devon:

Yee naaldlooshii.
Right.
So how does one become a skinwalker?
Murder.
Devon:

I am a skinwalker.
My, uh, My research shows that you have to murder a family member in order to become a skinwalker, you sell your soul to the devil.
You have to kill, yes, but you don't sell your soul.
You make a pact for power.
Have you ever shapeshifted?
Steven:

Is it painful?
Your back hurts, your jaw.
You can't feel anything else.
Your mind splits in two.
You give up everything that makes you human.
Become animal.
Animal?
Are you saying you're not in control when you transform?
No.
No, no.
Power blinds you.
Only silver stops it.
Would you call yourself a monster?
Um, would you mind dimming the lights?
Bryan, could you dim the lights?
I got it.
How's that?

Thank you.
Murielle:

Devon:

Let's get under way.
Oh, um, if it's all the same to you,
I'd rather have him ask me the questions.
What?
Devon:

Oh, but can't you do it?
I don't really talk unless it's to him.
The quiet ones are always more fun.
Sure.
Bryan:

If you prefer to start that way.
Shayla:

How do I...
Just ask, man.
You don't have to sit that far away,
I don't bite.
Bryan:

Oh, this is going to be fun.
Um, So, What's your name?
Call me Shayla.
Bryan:

Do I seem fake to you?
Fake, well, um, you say that you're a vampire, so...
Only for the sake of brevity.
There are a lot of misconceptions about my kind.
Truth is more complicated.
Bryan:

Um, how old are you?
Hm, it's rude to ask a woman's age.
I'm not ageless, if that's what you mean.
We all die, just like we all bleed.
Bryan:

Yes.
Bryan:

God, no.
Bryan:

Have you ever gone out all night, drinking, and you felt like shit the next day?
That's how I feel in the sunlight.
Hungover, sick, everything stings, every noise is amplified.
The sound of a busy street, dogs barking, kids screaming, it's grating on my ears.
And then at night, everything quiets down and I can hear myself think.
It allows me to do my work.
Uh, what do you do for a living?
I'm an artist.
Do you have any tattoos I can't see?
Um, one.
Show me.
J-s-s-r-k-n?
Bryan:

Ex-girlfriends?
Not exactly.
So, How do you restrain yourself when your clients bleed?
Oh.
I don't.
Restraint is not my strength.
I can't resist a taste.
I consider it a tip.
Bryan:

Yes, but not in the way you're thinking.
Bryan:

People need much more than sustenance to survive.
Caffeine, alcohol, sex.
Drugs.
You know the feeling, don't you?
The warm rush in your veins, the euphoria, like you've just been fucked by Athena.
You know that feeling, don't you?
I know you know.
You have been high before.
Yeah.
Then you know how fleeting it is, how quickly the body acclimates, and how quickly the wolf gets hungry again.
I tasted your blood.
Oxycontin, it was never my favorite, but, you know, it really dulls the pain.
Jamal:

I don't know what she's talking about, she...
Jamal:

Was that, was that a secret?
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
You shouldn't keep secrets.
You know, just because you turn your back on the devil, doesn't mean he stops following you.
Shut the fuck up!
You are fucking lying'!
This is bullshit!
Devon:

Your boy's losing it.
Shayla:

We need to make up.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't know he was lying to all of you.
It hurts again.
Where are they?
Bryan:

You know what the fuck I'm talking about.

Bryan, I know you're high.
Bryan:

Your fucking pupils are dilated!
Don't play with me.
The fuck is this?

Bryan:

Jamal:

Just get out of my fucking house.
I'm not floating you around for another month.
Bryan:

Fuck you!

Listen, Devon didn't use me, you did!
You lied straight to my face!
You lied to everybody!
Listen, man, you made your choice.
Don't blame me for making mine.
Man, find your way out back.
I don't need you fucking up more of my shots.
Here's a v-log, mom and dad.
Take a good look at your son!
Your fuck-up, junkie son, who can't even go a day without a dose!
Don't it just make you proud?
God damn it!
Fuck!
Fuck!
I didn't mean to take your name in vain.
I'm just weak!
I need it.
Murielle:

Jamal:

Let's just finish this.
Devon:

Please say your name for camera.
Shiori.
Devon:

I want it to go away.
Devon:

The bad man.
He promised if we come here and talk to you he'll leave.
Devon:

Always.
Since we were born.
Devon:

He's close.
Have you ever seen him?
Can you tell me what he looks like?
He's smiling.
Always smiling.
He has no lips.
His eyes are big.
He looks like an animal.
Devon:

He holds us down at night.
Forces himself inside.
Is this a nightmare you have?
He scratches me.
Murielle:

Poor thing.
Devon:

God hates us.
Jamal:

I see him.
Go away!
I know what you want!
Go away!
Jamal:

Murielle:

Shiori, it's okay, there's nothing there!
Jamal:

Devon:

Murielle:

Hang on, it's going to be okay.
Just take care of her, I'll be right back!
Need some help?

I got it, I got it.
Hey, are you okay?
I'll go get help!
Oh, my god.
Devon:

What the fuck are those things?
Murielle:

Monsters aren't real!
Bryan:

Jamal, is that you?
The fuck?
Murielle:

Murielle:

We have to go back for him!
We have...

Murielle:

We're his only chance!
We don't stand a chance!
Bryan:

Bryan, we're leaving now!
Murielle:

We have to...

Murielle:

Bryan:

Bryan:

Devon:

Where's Jamal?
Devon:

Come on.
Vampire stake, holy water, salt, knife, everything we need is in there.
Here, you should know how to use that.
I got the stake.
Bryan:

Devon:

Bryan:

Murielle:

You hear that?
Bryan:

Shiori.
Bryan:

Devon:

Stay back.
I got this.
Shiori, Shiori?
Just listen to me, okay?
Shiori, just listen to me.
I promise, okay?
Everything's going to be all right.
Just trust me.
Shiori, Shiori?
Trust me.
It's going to be okay.

Murielle:

He's upstairs, come on!
Devon:

Jamal, talk to me!
Where are you?
Murielle:

Devon:

Don't shoot, it's us!
Devon:

Murielle:

Devon:

Fuck.

Shit.
Devon:

Bryan:

What the fuck happened?
Jamal:

What are you doing up here?
Well, I came back to save your ass, didn't I?
Devon:

I must have grabbed the gun from the holster.
I put four rounds in his ass, motherfucker still wouldn't go down.
I don't think we're gonna make it out.
Murielle:

Murielle:

You see anything?

Bring me the stake!
Jamal!
Jamal:

Bryan:

You bitch.
Devon:

Jamal:

Oh, man.
Murielle:

That bitch tried to drink me like fucking milk.

Devon:

Jamal:

Murielle:

Shit, who can kill the motherfucker?
Bryan:

Only silver kills him.
Devon:

Maybe we can go around.
Come on, this way.

All right, Jamal, get behind me.
Just like we do.
Jamal:

Bryan:

Jamal:

Go!
Jamal:

Be careful.
Devon:

She might still be possessed.
Jamal:

Murielle:

What do we do with her?
Devon:

She can't fight this demon for long.
It takes over again...
Bryan:

Murielle:

Shiori:

Devon:

Bryan, take this.
Run.
Jamal:

Shiori:

Devon:

Bryan:

Come on, move!
Come on, hurry, move!
Jamal, move, move!
Jamal:

Move!
Devon:

Stay right here.
Murielle:

Jamal:

Holy shit!
Bryan:

The walls are not boarded up, but they're sealed with concrete.
I told you he won't let us leave.
That doesn't make any sense.
I unlocked the door, but it still wouldn't open.
So what are you saying?
We're locked in from outside!
It's the hammering we heard outside.
Murielle:

Bryan:

I'll find us a way out, I promise.
Get out of my way!
Devon:

Bryan:

Give me your flashlight, okay?
Come on, come on.
Come on!

Devon:

What did I do with it?
Devon:

Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
You will pay for your sins, Bryan.
They kingdom come, thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven.
Forgive us our trespasses, and those who trespass against us.
Bryan:

Happy birthday.
Bryan:

What the hell is this?
This can't be real.
Demon:

Who is that?
Where are you?
It's not real, it's not real.
Shiori?
Shiori?
What's going on?
What are you doing here?
Where are we?
Demon:

Happy birthday, Bryan.
Sorry I missed it.
Bryan:

It wasn't your fault, it was mine.
Hey Bryan, you were right, man.
That stuff you sold us was really good shit!
Bryan:

I'm sorry.
You still got that coming, Bryan.
I hear sex is so much better when you're high.
Makes you feel alive.
I want to feel alive again.
Bryan:

Look, I'm sorry!

No!
Murderer!
Bryan:

Demon:

Karen Nathan.
You killed them all, Bryan.
Bryan:

You sold them their poison and now they're dead.
Your drugs killed them.
Bryan:

I didn't think anything bad would happen!
You thought wrong, murderer.
Murderer, murderer!
Bryan:

Get away!
Bryan, are you okay?
Bryan:

What the hell happened?
Jamal:

Bryan:

Your friends are waiting for you in hell, Bryan!
Bryan:

The power and the glory forever!
Just like I will be!
Bryan:

Murielle:

Devon:

Jamal:

Jamal:

Do something, help her!

Murielle/demon:

Everything you love.
That is not my name.
I am the demon Baphomet,
Baphomet, Baphomet, Baphomet.
Bryan:

She will die, you will all die.
Descended into heaven and now sits at the right hand of god, the father almighty.
God cannot save this world.
He is coming.
Bryan:

Devon:

Who's he?
Devon:

Now!
Is she dead?
It's over.
Bryan:

Devon:

Bryan:

What happened?
Bryan:

It's all right.
Where is Jamal?
Devon:

Bryan:

Devon:

Bryan:

Murielle:

Devon:

Murielle:

Devon:

Stay back.
Don't look at me.
Bryan:

Jamal:

I think I need to go to the hospital.
Bryan:

Just grab my arm.
Jamal:

Murielle:

Devon:

Bryan:

Jamal:

Bryan:

Jamal:

Just go!
Make sure Murielle gets out safe!
Devon:

Come on, come on, come on.
Get up!

Just me, come on, come on.
Jamal?
Hey, come on, I'm going to get you out of here, all right?
Hey, look at me.
Bryan, I'm sick.
I know, I'm going to get you out of here, all right, I promise you.
Devon:

Bryan:

Devon:
Do you think it got Bryan?
Yes.
What's happening to me?
You were bit.
You're dying.
Help me.
Please someone help me.
Please help me, help me.
Devon:

Murielle:

Bryan:

He is coming.
Fuck you!
Bryan:

No, no, no, no, no!
No, no!
Bryan:

Come on, come on!
Oh, shit!
Bryan:

Devon.
Devon:

A master orchestration.
What is all this?
Wow, those drugs really did make you slow.
There's no way out, Bryan.
And god can't save you.
Devon:

Bryan:

Devon:

It was you, you killed them.
Do you see blood on my hands?
What about Murielle?
Devon:

I thought you loved her.
Love.
Love is sacrifice, Bryan.
I needed her, I needed all of you.
The crew, the monsters, the lunar eclipse, even this particular house was all part of the plan.
You all had to die on this night.
I couldn't kill any of you myself for the ritual, but I provided you with the weapons, perfect scenario, and you performed your roles wonderfully.
You see, Bryan, the documentary... isn't what you think it is.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I need you look at me and I want you to see.
Why me?
Because you believe in god.
You're razed with this and I want him to see this.
You hear me?
I want you to see this.
I want you all to see this.
See what?
Devon:

Anoint the head of your king.
In the name of Satan,
Luciferis Sentus, desolation of man, god of hellfire, defiler of innocence, we your children invoke you tonight.
Oh, radiant father, by the moon this fallen king shall rise from the fires of hell and claim this world, his birthright.
Those that burn, bow onto thy fury and thy wisdom.

You restore our souls!

And you will lead me to the path!
Flame eternal!
Damn ye to god!
Richard:

Thank you, Martha.
The antichrist cometh.
