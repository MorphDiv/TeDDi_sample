Morning, Leslie.
Lakeman.
So what should I do?
About your weird co-worker?
Yeah.

Narc on him.
But listen, I'm not fucking around about you being sure.
I know.
You've suffered brain damage and now we're asking people to trust your perceptions.
Yeah.
Monday morning, go do a full sensory reevaluation.
Go to the spot.
Do a full sensory recall.
And if that's the way you remember it, if you remember that he pushed you, then that's that.
Okay?

But you have to be certain.
Because we want you to get your word back, right?
And after that, who knows, maybe you'll even laugh again.
Hey...
Yeah.
You just did it.
What time does this thing end?
This duck hunt?
In a few hours.
What then?
Then they go to Luxembourg without me.
Do you know what to do?
What do you have to take care of, still?
I think Birdbath's okay.
Um...

Okay.
Icabod.
What does he want?
Um...

Hey, John.
It's time to kill some birds for me, my man.
How many?
Well, how many bird is the right amount to kill to turn a girl on?
It depends on the girl probably.
Yeah.
Probably none.
For most girls, I guess.
Yeah.
Eleven, I think, with her.
Hey, John.
Hi, Icabod.
What'cha working at?
Card tricks.
Pick a card.
Two of spades.
Sorry, guy.
John?
Yeah?
Sorry I came on so strong with the liar business.
Sometimes to get people's attention,
I have to play to my strengths which is to go a little dark, I guess.
I'm not an All-American Boy.
I get the Headless Horseman thing a lot.
Dark grim thing.
But actually I'm quite light-hearted, tender and I enjoy lots of contact.
Cool.
I'm not what meets the eye.
Your resume?
Penn?

Yeah.
All-American Boy.
Okay.
You look like an All-American Boy.
Okay.
But are you?
You seem to be under an unusual amount of stress.
Maybe we're both struggling with expectations.
You lied on your resume, John.
Didn't attend Penn.
Maybe you're not quite the All-American Boy,
Not what meets the eye.
Big whoop.

John, I'd like to embrace you and send you a non-verbal message to you saying "I get you, I know how you feel."
You're just human.

That's what cuddling's about.

How does it work?
You just come together.
It's the easiest thing in the world.
How did you know I didn't go to Penn?
Class of '83.

Shh.
Allow human contact to release dopamine, seratonin, two hormones that will fight your depression and really boost your mood.
Wow.
Okay.
Hey, John?
What's up?
We have one more bird to kill.
Yeah, so I don't know what's going on.
How many did you get?
I got nothing.
Eleven.
Yeah, so, my cat's been tired as shit lately.
Your weapons cold and open?
All right, let's head home.

Hold them up.
Now they come.
Jesus fuck.
Lakeman.
You shot me in the fucking face!
Sorry, Leslie.
Boy, we're in the 11th hour here in regards to closing this Denon deal.
I was counting on Leslie's expertise.
And that's not going to happen.
John?
John, I guess you're coming along to Luxembourg as you're the only one who's up to speed on Leslie's Denon pitch.
Welcome back.
You deal with those last two things, we're back on track.
In Luxembourg a day before you need to be.
Before what?
Before the little glass blower gets out of jail and gets the bag back?
Glass blower?
Didn't you say the glass blower's in jail and she's going to be given...
Puppeteer, John.
Okay.
What's going on here?

I don't want you preparing to go up against a glass blower when you're going up against...
It's probably...
Is it that different?
Well, I don't know.
A puppeteer's probably easier.
They live in small fragile worlds of the imagination.
Your glass blower has to go up against the hard facts of life.
Like things could break at any moment.
And...

Yeah.
And John, so we should be able to pull this off.
We're at the end of the troubled part of this.
Let's get it back.
It's only been a couple weeks.

All the important work is right out there ahead of us.
We need to make a difference here.
So let's go.
- Yeah.

So I was saying, you get there the day before we take the bag back.
Good, I can get some rest.
You'll be killing the physicist's wife.
The other side is trying to get this bag, too.
I have to caution against that.
She has a date at the Bettborn train station with the bag, so we're going to caution against them coming together.
There's a reason they sent her, John.
Her husband's on a no fly.
Worse comes to worst, she's gone from the scenario, they have to find another way to get the money to him.
Buys us a couple weeks.
So we're just buying time now?
No, they're trying to get the bag from A-to-B, too, John.
And B is a bad place.
B is an armed Iran.
You shouldn't be uncertain about that if you're uncertain about that.
I have to go.
Are you okay?
You can stand on a piano all you want I guess,
But if you don't look both ways...
Yeah.
We're a couple men down here,
So John, on this last push here with Denon, you're taking lead.
Shit.
What's that?

No, I said you can count on me.
Okay.

Yeah, John can't go.
What?
- John.

- Can't go.

His paperwork situation.
What situation?
Well, he doesn't technically work here.
I put Sure Shot back on the travel squad.
I'm calling you Sure Shot now.
Okay.
Well, Sure Shot doesn't work here.
I can't process his paperwork.
Today was the deadline on the supplemental material.
Not yet received.
Sure Shot can't travel or actually even be on this premises in any regard other than "visitor" now.
Due to liabilities.
One too many digits.
I can't mess with H.R., Sure Shot.

John Lakeman, supplemental tax paperwork.
Did you like that driving?
Cool driving.
Yeah, it was cool.
I'm not even trained at that either.
Fucking pulled it out.
Jesus, my legs are like Jell-O.
- Chair?

Lakeman locks down the paperwork.
Who's that guy?
My husband.
Hey, John.
Yeah.
- Hang on.

Okay.

I just, whenever I think about that, I feel so lucky.
And I just say it.
Okay, well, I have to tell you something, honey.
Regarding...

Could I have a word with you?
I have your information.
We're running late, guy.

I'm not permitted to do that.
I'm not allowed to write anything down.
John doesn't allow you to?
No.

Cool.

You do.
Thanks.
Ron.

Just tell me.
Okay...

Yeah.
- Puppe-Got it.

Asi puppe fly fly away from her cage.
Will have, most likely, the red thing you need.
Big dark beard man also there 2 p.m.
for red thing.
- Got it.

So eyes out for jujitsu.
Got it, honey?
Yeah, thanks, honey.
Safe trip.
Eddie.
Yeah?
Does John kill people?
Eddie...
No way.
I know what she's investigating.
It's murder.
- She's wrong.

She's wrong.
My dad'll be able to explain it.
Yeah?
Yeah, what?
Your dad will be able to explain it?
Yeah...

Dad wouldn't ask him to do that.
Why wouldn't he?
Because that's too much.
To ask.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Mikham Candahar.
He floated up from the river, dead from the river, with your address, handwritten, in his coat pocket.
What is this?
Saline.
And?
And morphine For the pain.
Morphine.
Let me ask you a question.
Not in an angry fashion.
While a man is unconscious, is it S.O.P to fill him with powerful drugs without checking his chemical history?
Is that S.O.P?
It is when they've been shot in the face.
Would you like it removed?
It feels...
I'm sorry?
It feels like...
It feels like one might expect it to feel if they, say, were flying on a magic carpet.
Would you like it removed?
Your phone's been ringing for the last ten hours.
Hello?
Mr. Claret?
Yes.
This is Detective Albans from the Luxembourg City Police.
I have a question.
A subsequent question about John Lakeman.
The asshole.
Yes.
The young asshole.
Do you have a moment?
Yes.
Mr. Claret, you mentioned John Lakeman missed a dinner on May 11th, to retrieve a bag.
I never asked you...
Did he return with the bag?
Got your little suit back?
You're 40 minutes late.
They sent my bag to the wrong hotel.
- Yes.

Yes, he did.
The asshole.
If you recall, Mr. Claret, what color was this bag?
Red-ish.
Garment bag.
Red-ish.
Thank you.
What are you...

Removing your morphine drip.
Well, let's not be hasty.
How about it?
I'm flying here.
I...

Yeah?
What?
Does Dad ask you to kill people, John?
I'm killing a woman at 3 A.M. tonight.
Do you want to help me?
Of course not.
Then what help are you, man?
This is a song about somebody I killed.
If I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.
Fuck your rules, this concerns John.
I'm putting my foot down.
Fuck your foot.

Well, stop!
Hey.
Hey.
How are you?
The doctors couldn't find anything wrong.
I mean you took a hell of a wallop but they said there were no...
Nothing's broken, nothing's...
Yeah, I'm okay.
No.

What time is it?
It's lay down.

It's 1:35.
I'm okay.
Just stay there, John.
Are you really unhurt?
Because the girl gets out in 25 minutes.
With the bag...
Lay down.

So you're saying you're okay.

Because you didn't do the thing that you were instructed to do last night and she'll be waiting at the Bettborn train station for that bag.
You can take it before then.
I can't do it.

You know what, fuck you.
John...
I'm often told not to do something which I'm then expected to do anyway.
I was told not to do this.
This task.

I was prohibited.
And I'm expected to anyway.
So if this gets exposed, then, well, son, I'm exposed.
What I'm saying, John, this came unraveled.
Quickly.
And we dug in a little too deep.
If it doesn't get right back on track then I could go to jail.
I'm all right.
You were hit by a car.

John can speak for himself, Edward.
Yeah?

Eddie, I'm fine.

A puppeteer.
Either way.
Wait, you're really all right?
I'm fucking fine.

You going to get her?
Yeah, I'm going.
Then hurry.
Hey.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Hello.
That's my bag.
Which?
The red one.

Where's the, um...
I left it back there.

The money?
Yes.
Why?
It's heavy.
Why did you take the bag?
I need to make a sunrise.
For my new show.
My show of marionettes.
It's specifically the right color.
For that.
You didn't want the money?
No.
You just wanted the bag?
Yes.
Okay.
So, where's the money now?
I left it in a simple carefree style on the dresser in the ladies' police room.
I like your music.
My friend gave it to me.
She cared little for it.
I'm so sorry.
No, it's cool, you can't... you know, please all people.
May I use one of your songs for my show?
Yeah.

"Circles of Resonance".
Why?
I just like it.

Why do you like that?
Because I steal shit all the time for my puppet show.
And it makes me feel less bad for not being a perfect citizen, I guess.
Well, no-one's a perfect, um... citizen, probably.
Are you okay?
You don't look well.
I got hit by a car recently.
Wow.

I'm doing something for work just now.
As a musician, you'd think that would have a more laid-back lifestyle.
I'm not a musician.
Why not?
I guess when I was a kid my dad told me it was a kind of hard life.
You have to sleep in vans and stuff.
So... anyway, he suggested something else.
So you do puppets?

Yeah, it is cool.
So the money is just sitting on the dresser.
Yeah.

See you.
See you.
Yeah.

The police station.

Cause a distraction.
How?
I don't know, man.

Excuse me.
Um, I'd like to file a report.
Um, I was mugged.
Um, they took everything, except my glasses.
I don't think they wanted me to give chase, as it were.
Um...
But I think that I should file a report.
Or something.
To whomever.
And while I'm here I wouldn't mind paying some parking tickets.
Hi.

Must be, like, 100 years old?
This is the train you take when you're trying to get out of town.
Bettborn station.
Yes.
Wherever you're going... you're not going to be able to get from here-to-there as easily as you think.
Why don't you just take the bag from me now?
You read my note.
And the terms appeal to you.

I don't know exactly who you are, but I know what you do.
And I know you are sad.
My train's coming.
If you let me board, you can leave here, these things you've been doing that make you sad, John.
Whatever is burdening you.
And go wherever else you'd like.
And nothing that you did here will follow.
If you allow me to board, you can be wherever.
Be whomever.
You'll be free.
Hello.
Something's happened, John.
Your brother, he's been taken.

Bring it in.
What?
The bag.
