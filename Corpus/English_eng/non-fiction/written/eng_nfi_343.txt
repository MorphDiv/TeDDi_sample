Yeah, get to the point, Greg.
We didn't come here to watch your one-man show.
A long, dark, snowy winter.
But it's almost the weekend, isn't it?
Maybe it'll be sunny.
I can take my kite out.
It's gonna snow again this weekend.
Shut up, bitch!
Oh, my God!
I mean, not yet.
Good morning, everyone!
Who wants lemon squares?
Don't take one.
Her lemon squares are always a trap.
Then you should have come to staff karaoke last night.
None of you showed up.
♪ Squiggle, squiggle, circle ♪
♪ Line thing that looks like a table ♪
Can I pick the next song?
No!
Where were you guys?
I thought it was a joke.
I mean, because why would I wanna hang out with these people?
I don't think that's funny, Chuck.
I thought we were all friends.
We can't stand each other!
You know the hardest part about earning so much money?
Not knowing if you'll be able to spend it all before you die.
I have to call my sixth grade English teacher and tell her she was wrong about me.
Mrs. Alfieri?
Oh, she died?
Where's her grave?
Hey, Greg, Greg!
Can I talk to you about something?
I'm not buying any more of your candy bars, Carol.
I know it's a scam, and you're not on a basketball team.
It's about the staff.
I wanna know why people aren't friends around here.
It's not just about karaoke.
It's people's bad 'tudes!
Nobody even showed up for staff photo!
It's not normal, Greg.
I talked to the intern from "Morning Wined Up"
and their staff hangs out all the time.
You want us to be more like "Morning Wined Up"
with Kelly and Mary-Kelly.
Okay, now I like this duvet.
Put it in your cart!
Put it in your cart!
Mary-Kelly, you are the reason the bank took my house.
I'm just saying if people were friends around here, it would make work better.
There'd be less fighting, less complaining, less graffiti about you in the bathroom.
Carol, leave me alone.
I'm just trying to make it to the weekend.
Okay, here's the rundown.
So I did some more research on the superbug, and...
Okay.
I'm not gonna stop chewing 'em.
You're sleeping with Chuck.
I would never.
My body is a temple, and by that I mean I let a lotta Jewish guys in.
But seriously, though, Chuck asked me to produce a piece because, you know, he thinks I'm doing a good job.
He sees something in me.
What are you talking about?
Men have helped women plenty of times.
They, um... in...
Beast helps Belle.
Although, I guess he's a beast, and he did wanna have sex with her.
Carol.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What do you think you're doing?
Getting the gang together like you told me to.
Everybody, please collect your chairs.
This was a fake meeting called by a well-meaning dementoid.
There's nothing wrong with that chair.
It ain't broke!
Hey, everybody, Gene broke my chair!
I'll buy everyone new chairs.
Come on, chair.
Do you see what I'm dealing with here?
This place is a tinderbox waiting for the smallest spark to explode.
We do not need more time together.
We need to get through the show and go home.
Stop trying to make this happen, Carol.
There's nothing you can do.
Nothing.
Stop walking with a fake limp.
Hey, God, it's Carol.
I just want my coworkers to be friends.
I don't know if your powers extend to other religions, but if they do, please include Gene and the very nice Turban Guy in accounting.
Amen.
Tune in next week for my two-part expose:
"Are shoelaces getting shorter?"
Hey, men have helped women, right?
Like in the history of the world?
But women they didn't wanna have sex with, though?
Ooh, well, like Mr. Miyagi when the Karate Kid was a girl.
But I guess technically she was a kid, so...
You do know I'm currently producing
And that's our show for our local viewers.
Enjoy the light dusting of snow this weekend.
Have fun out there.
What the hell's going on in here?
We now go to Washington for a special report.
14 dead tonight in the blizzard of the century.
Keep New York in your prayers.
And I guess New Jersey.
Wait, wait... what happened to the light dusting?
Like it says on my tramp stamp...
Weather changes.
In the last hour, it got upgraded to a snowmageddon of the century on steroids.
Why didn't you warn us?
If you wanna read it, you're gonna have to pay 12 cents on Amazon like everybody else.
Mm!
Well, it doesn't matter, does it?
Because we made it through the show.
Now we can all just go home and hop in the tub with our cat.
Oh, my God, you gotta cool it with that cat stuff.
Hey, you guys.
The Governor of New Jersey is declaring a state of emergency.
All roads are closed.
We're stuck here together.
Good God.
We're stuck here together!
Good, God!
Yes, sir, I'm so sorry for the mishap.
Everything here is under control.
Yes, I love you too.
So why don't we have an icebreaker?
Two truths and a lie.
I had 30 moles removed.
I had my thyroid removed.
I had my uterus removed.
Oh, all right.
Well, you need two more.
How 'bout next time you have some urgent weather info, you walk up here and tell us?
I once saw you pee lying down.
You do it literally all the time.
I think everyone in here is just doing their absolute best.
That was the lie.
I told you this would happen, Carol!
And I'm not questioning my faith at all.
No one taught me how to pee the right way, because I didn't have a dad!
Hey, Mr. Pierce, I have...
Um...
I have the... the research for the...
What do you think of my look?
I based it on a Michael Bublé album cover.
Pretty fresh, huh?
Yeah, it's... it's... fine.
I-I don't really know that much about fashion.
I got this at a Halloween store.
It's actually supposed to be Frankenstein's top.
So...
D-do you wanna talk about the story?
♪ Never seen you lookin' so lovely ♪
♪ As you did tonight... ♪
What do you think of this tune?
It was playing when my dog died, but...
I still think it's sexy.
Some people say it started when a bat flew into a dog's anus.
Tell me... if a guy like me were to ask a girl like you out on a date, where would you wanna go?
Oh, no.
Groovy.
Katie?
People in this office are never gonna be friends.
Oh, Lord, what do I do?
Give me a sign.
Ah... ♪ Hallelujah ♪
♪ Hallelujah ♪
♪ Hallelujah... ♪
Can't talk, Ang.
I'm in the middle of a miracle!
Well, I know everyone's in a fight, and I know nobody wants to hear from me...
I just thought I'd make one final Hail Mary pass to get this chicken coop clucking' to the same tune.
Oh, my God, she's got wine.
There's plenty for everybody!
This is the happiest moment of my life.
Better than when I got off that liver transplant list.
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no!
I found wine!
Carol, we can't get drunk in the office.
Turn down for what, Greg?
People need party time, and you can't stop 'em.
Don't you unscrew that bottle.
Don't you take that sip.
Don't you swish it around your mouth.
Don't you swallow it and make a satisfied "ah" sound!
Ah!
Carol, Carol, Carol!
Hey.
Where have you been?
I was just sexually harassed.
No, I mean... you were right.
I thought he was singling me out because I was good at my job.
Hey... don't let him steal your power.
You are a strong, modern woman.
You need to march right into Chuck's office, grab that jerk by the collar, and kiss him on the lips.
If you tell Chuck you're not interested, you'll embarrass him.
But if you kiss him and then push him away and be like, "I want this so bad,
"but you're my boss.
We could never be together, Mr. Roker,"
then your problem's solved.
But that doesn't sound very modern or empowered.
I am never kissing Chuck Pierce.
Well, you better think of something, because if Chuck feels rejected, he's not gonna want to work with you.
He won't even be able to look you in the eye.
Oh, no, and then I'm gonna be stuck doing stupid fluff pieces with Por... shh...
Yoo-hoo!
Greg, what are you doing moping in here?
Come on out and have a little fun.
I'm not moping.
I'm about to get fired for all this, so I'm looking for a new job.
Okay, you know what, mister?
I am sick of your bad attitude!
All you care about is running this office and following rules and making sure we do a show every day.
That is literally my job description.
You're a grump, and it's trickled down to your whole staff.
Well, I'm sorry, Carol, but when things go wrong around here, it falls on my shoulders and only my shoulders.
No.
But I've been a mom.
Ehhhh!
But that's because I made it that way.
When Katie was in third grade, she used to beg to have ice cream every night for dinner.
Typical fatty.
But it was my job as her mom to say no.
Until one day I said yes, and you know why?
Because I wanted to have ice cream for dinner.
Cool twist, huh, Greg?
You do a great job at running this office.
Maybe I am the problem.
I never have any fun.
And it affects everyone around me.
My cat won't even let me sleep in bed with her anymore.
You're right.
Maybe Mama does need a break.
Chuck, we need to talk.
I know the real reason why you asked me to do the superbug story.
And honestly, you should be ashamed of yourself.
You figured it out, huh?
I mean, what were you thinking?
The age difference alone is...
I know, I know!
Of course someone your age wouldn't be interested in me... a man old enough to remember the "Challenger" explosion.
Because, arguably, he caused it.
I just feel like a fool!
Well, I...
I hope this isn't gonna make things awkward.
Not at all.
Everything will be very... uh, normal.
Well, see ya later.
Have you gone yet?
I need to make this right.
What the hell are you doing?
Keep it in your pants!
But you asked me where I wanted to go on a date!
I was using you to research what young people like.
I'm trying to ask out this totally hot 25-year-old smoothie maker at my gym.
Cheyennica.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.
Well, you oughta be!

Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Is anyone sober?
I wanna play American baseball!
Someone throw a camera at me.
Hey... hi, Greg.
I'm amazing.
"The Breakdown."
Mastercard, Visa!
Cha-ching!
Oh, you got it, chief.
Oh, crud.
Hey, Greg.
Let me finish impressing everyone.
The network just called, and they want us to do a special broadcast about the storm.
Yeah, they do.
'Cause we got the best news team in the biiiiiz!
No, like in 20 minutes.
You know what, how drunk can a person really be?
Oh!
Ooh...
How are we supposed to do the show?
We're all wasted.
Greg, you're being dramatic.
Okay, this is frozen.
I'm just gonna call the network and tell 'em we can't go on.
If they fire me, they fire me.
It's my job to predict the weather.
But it's also my job to spin a sign in front of a cell phone store every morning, and I guess I'm spread too thin.
We all should have known about that storm but... my stupid stories jammed the printer.
Don't call them stupid.
I read "Murder at the Spooky Barn."
I mean, you got four beautiful kids.
And Billy's hormone therapy is not gonna pay for itself.
He is only 7 inches tall.
That is not tall enough.
I'll take the blame.
I found the wine.
I got God to make it snow.
Plus, I got the call from the network three hours earlier when they first wanted us to do the story, but I forgot to tell anyone.
Yeah.
Wait, guys, guys.
And for reasons I don't wanna get into,
I'm too embarrassed to work here anymore.
So just let me take the blame.
Katie, I'm not gonna let that happen.
You belong right here.
You're a damn good producer.
She tried to kiss me, everybody.
Hey, hey, hey!
Do not judge her.
Everybody in this room has thought about it.
She just had the balls to do it!
I will take the blame.
What if no one has to take the blame?
What does everyone say?
Yeah.
Let's make a news show!

Okay, guys, here goes nothing.
It's a special edition of "The Breakdown"
with your host Chimp Please and Renee Renee Renee.
Close enough.
Hold the elevator!
So you tried to kiss Chuck.
That's not even the weirdest thing that happened last night.
Gene and Justin did ultimately put on a sex show.
It was Portia's idea to... kiss Chuck.
I should never listen to her.
I mean, Schindler?
It was a really long list.
He couldn't have wanted to sleep with all of them.
And you're not attracted to me.
No!
I mean, you know, you're very...
Thank you.
I'm just gonna check my phone.
Yeah, it's really buzzing' in there.
Oh man, I have so many texts from my cat.
My girlfriend, Cat.
Oh your...your girlfriend.
That's why you had to go to your Cat's sister's wedding.
You need help getting to your car?
