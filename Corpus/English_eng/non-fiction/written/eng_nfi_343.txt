Abby.
Hey.
We need to talk.
Yeah.
You wanna go inside?
No.

Damn.
I just need to finish this.
Uh... before you say anything...
After the other night, I went home, and I put a cigarette out on our prom picture.
And our winter formal picture.
Not our homecoming picture, 'cause my hair looked fuckin' awesome.
I never wanted to think about you again.
I was so pissed at you.
Then I started worryin' about how you were doin', which pissed me off even more.
So, how you doin', you fuckin' asshole?
Heather's keeping the baby.
Oh, my God!
Would you stop tellin' me things?

I'm sorry.
We just...

Jesus, Colt.
This whole thing is like a relentless shitstorm.
How am I supposed to react to this?
- I was hoping...

You know what the worst part is?

Who am I gonna be mad at?

You, for wanting to support her?

- I get that this...

What's the deal, huh?
You're just gonna...
Have a kid with another woman and I'm supposed to go along with it?
Well, say somethin'!
I don't know what to say.

I love you, and I wanna be with you, but I also...

Yeah, it really is.
I'm not gettin' you a fuckin' baby shower gift.
That's fair.
Is that an Oreo Blizzard?
- Yeah.

- Did you get the fudge core?

Ugh, you're the worst.
We'll get through this.
"We"?
Yeah, didn't you hear the part where I said "I love you"?
No.
I heard the part where you said I was the worst.
Well...
I meant I love you.
I love you, too.
Ugh, you're the worst.
Just to be clear, this food belongs to the bar.
It's only here temporarily.
Same goes for you.
- Love you, too, Daddy.

Hey.
What's with all the food?
Oh, shit.

No, dummy.

Dad's insulting' me, Mom wants to sell the bar...
And if you're gonna wear a shirt like that, you need to start doin' more curls.
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Oh, I don't know what I'm gonna do yet.
So what?

Hey, you gonna help us?

I mean, I can't stop lookin' pretty, so...
Oh, hey, uh, by the way...

Oh, hey, uh, Heather's keeping the baby.

What the fuck, dude?
I got a text from Mary.
I didn't wanna ruin it for them.

Oh, my God, you're gonna be a dad!
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

That's the same thing I said.
Congratulations, Colt.
I got some old phone books if you need a car seat.
Yeah, I'm happy for you, dude.

Come on.

Hey, I'm just sayin'.

Hey, uh, you know what the best part is?
Abby ain't even mad.
I mean, well, she was.

And then she was only kind of mad, and now she's, like, just normal mad.
But she says that's just part of dating' me.
Also a part of being your mother.
- And your brother.

Oh, by the way, Dad,
I got a bunch of stuff I gotta do tomorrow, so I don't think I can go to that cattle auction with you.
Fine with me.
The only thing I want riding shotgun with me is my shotgun.
- You're going to that auction, aren't you?

Well, you guys should go together.
- What?

What's going on between you two, it's stupid.
It's just ridiculous to drive four hours in two trucks when you're going to the same damn place.
Stop this nonsense and act like grown men.
Fine.

- 5:30.

Dad, the roads are really icy.

Great idea.
See you at 5:00.
Thanks, asshole.
Yeah, I didn't wanna ruin it for him.

- Installing some new windows?

I had to punch out the old ones at the Arby's drive-thru.
Before I forget, here's a to-do list for while I'm gone.
"Don't fuck up."
I guess it's more of a to-don't list.
As in "to-don't fuck up my ranch."
Don't worry.

I gotta take Abby and her parents to breakfast.
We're gonna tell 'em about the baby.
You want my advice?
- Sure.

What the hell?
Holy shit!
Yeah.

I not only wanna have sex in this truck...
I wanna have sex with this truck.
Damn.
It's like what the pope would drive if he was a redneck.
- Where'd you get this?

Just one of the perks.
Along with my self-respect and a fat weekly paycheck.
How you doin', Colt?

So they just gave you this, huh?
- Yes, sir.

No real American would buy a Toyota.
So they gotta give 'em away.
Yeah, somebody hates the USA.
I'll give you three reasons why you're wrong.
One, built in Texas.
Two, Kyle Busch drives a Toyota.

Let's get goin'.
Yeah, all right, just help me, uh, throw the trailer on.
You think I'm gettin' into this rolling billboard for Neumann's Hill?
Jeez, Dad.

It's got heated seats, satellite radio, ECO mode...
Did you just say "ECO mode" in my driveway?
Hey, Dad, Rooster told me he voted for Hillary.
Have a good ride, buddy.
So, we're on the ski lift and who's on the chair in front of us?
Mr. Pat Sajak.
So when we got off, I said to him, "I would like to solve this puzzle.
What the heck are you doing in Beaver Creek, Mr. Sajak?"
Well, it wasn't him.
You know, I once, uh, didn't meet Alex Trebek in a Chili's.
Okay.

- Oh, God, they're getting married.

It's not that.

Colt?
- Right.

Uh...
How do I say this?
You know, sometimes in life, things happen that we don't expect.
Oh, God, you got Abby pregnant.
No.

He got his ex-girlfriend pregnant.
Are you kidding me?
But hey, at least we're not gettin' married.
Look, we weren't together at the time, all right?
And I know it's not an ideal situation... but we're gonna get through this together.
What are we gonna tell people?
I don't know, Mom.

Or, whatever you're comfortable telling' people.
You know, I want everything out in the open.
Or not.
It's up to you.
Colt, could we have a moment with Abby?
- Yes, sir.

Yes, Ma'am.
Whatever you have to say to me, you can say in front of Colt.
Fine.
What does this guy have to do to make you realize you shouldn't be with him?
- Dad.

Does he have to knock somebody else up?

- Break your heart for the umpteenth time?

Of course it is.

Abby, I love you.
And I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life.
But you deserve so much better than him.
- Sorry.

And tell him what?

Because he's not.
Be faster if you take Route 50.
Who told you that?

As a matter of fact, yeah.
It says there's an accident up ahead.
If there was an accident, I'd know about it.
Shouldn't you be in a better mood?

It will be nice to have a little Bennett around.
Teach him how to hunt, how to fish...
How to clean out the septic tank.
His little arms will come in handy.
You feed 'em, you change 'em and... you distract 'em when they're becoming' annoying.
Hey, look at that plane over there.
Ooh, that's a big one.
So you think Mom's really gonna sell the bar?
I don't know.
Why don't you ask that magic phone of yours?
Fine, I will.
Is Mom really gonna sell the bar?
I'm afraid I don't know the answer to that, Rooster.
How the fuck did it do that?
When am I gonna die?
- Here's to my parents hating you.

For the rest of my life.
To drinking' for the rest of our lives!
Ah.
All right, I'm headin' back to the ranch.
I gotta plow that feed path.
Your dad already hates me.

- Uh, Colt...

You wanna come with?
No, I'm good.

All right.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I mean, my parents have hated you since middle school.
We didn't start dating' till high school.
Yeah, I know.
I'll be good.

Whoo!

That's my girl.
She's a teacher.
Dale said he was over at your ranch.
Said you're doing all right.
Yeah, well, Dale's a good guy.
He'll compliment anyone who's payin' him.
Yeah, that's the thing.
Neumann's Hill won't let me hire him as my vet.
Not sure how to break the news.
What was your move for firing people?
Generally, I just pissed them off till they quit.
Yeah, well, I'd try that, but I'm not a crotchety old bastard.
Have a couple of dumb-ass kids.

You guys want another drink?
Does a tornado always find the trailer park?
Shirley, you're a hoot!

Okay.
We allowed to do that?
Here you go.
Abby.
Hey.
Hey!

What's with all the blondes?

I'm just gonna say it.
This is fuckin' weird.
Yeah.
- I'm just here to pick up some food.

I was at the gas station.

Well, the kitchen's closed here.

Well... how are you doing?
- Good.

Got a little morning sickness.
Threw up in Darlene's baby's crib.
It worked out, though.

Morning sickness?
Wait, why would you have morning sickness?
Oh, that's right. 'Cause you're havin' my boyfriend's baby.
Burn!

I don't wanna get involved.
"I don't wanna get involved."
You used to be cool, man.
Hey, Heather.
Colt told me the news.

You know, what she needs is some condoms.
Oh, I'm...
Yeah, well, I'm kidding.
God.
Oh, shit.

I taught you sex ed.
What?
Look, they got a typo in the program.
It's supposed to say "black Angus." Says "black Anus."
Shut up.
What you getting a bull for, anyway, huh?

Yeah, I'm gonna let a bull take a crack at those heifers that didn't take.
If I can snag one for under six grand, I'll get my money's worth.
Well, that makes sense.
Hey, look, if the bull can't get 'em pregnant, bet you Colt can.
Howdy, fellas.
- Hey, Dale.

Well, don't it smell great in here?
It smells like cow shit, Dale.
Ah, cowboy cologne.
What are you doing way over here?
Oh, they pay a few of us vets to come over and check the bulls out.
You know, turn your head and cough, that sort of thing.
See anything you like?
Well, the wings in the concession stand, but I forgot my Tums.
I love spicy, but spicy does not love me.
Next, we've got lot 12, bull number 9.
Bidding starts at 2,000.
Are you fucking kidding me?
May the best rancher win.
Hey.

It says "black Anus"!
Careful, be careful.

You want some aspirin?
- Yes.

Ooh, and bread.
You know what's better than bread?

Well, we're all outta toast.
We should go buy some toast.
You know what we didn't talk about?
You're gonna be a grandma.
- What's that all about?

Oh, God. "Grandma"?
Maybe I'll be "Nana Maggie."
No, that's sounds worse.

You know what's worse?
"Stepmom Abby." Ugh.
The new art teacher's a stepmom.
She wears clogs.
I will not wear clogs, Nana Maggie.
Why don't I get you a blanket?
Yeah.

Hey, can I smoke in here?
Look, just get some sleep, okay?
Your cigarettes will be right here in the morning.
Was supposed to be me.
What's that?
It was supposed to be me.
Colt's about to have a baby and it isn't mine.
You know what?

All right.

Now every first he has is gonna be with someone else.
First kid to call him Daddy won't be mine.
First kid to go to prom won't be mine.
First kid to go to college...
Well, it is Colt and Heather, so I might have a shot at that one.
Look, your time with Colt will come and it'll be just as special.
It was easier when I thought they weren't gonna keep the baby.
That make me a terrible person?
You're a wonderful person going through a... a tough time.
But you're not gonna go through it alone.
Okay?

He's been stepping up big time on this whole thing.
Just... talk to each other.
Tell him how you feel...
No, I need it.
You're just doin' this to piss me off.
By "this," you mean buying' a bull?
Bein' a rancher?

Yes.
It occurs to me that, uh, you taught Rooster everything he knows about picking a bull.
So it stands to reason you'd have the same taste.
If you think about it, that's, uh...

Lift that paddle again, I'll cut off your hand.
Less sweet.
Stay out of it, Dale.
Nah, maybe I ought to go get some kettle corn.
You know, 'round here they call it "cattle corn"?
I appreciate that.
You're not even buying' a bull for your own ranch.
You're just some hired hand for some corporation.
You know what?

This is stupid.
What'd you say you could spend on a bull, huh?

- Yeah.

Sixty-five hundred.
Congratulations.

Hope you can ride it home.
Don't worry about a ride home.

Thanks, Dale.
I'll come out later in the week and give that bull a proper examination.
Yeah, about that, uh...
Neumann's Hill won't let me use you.
They said you're not on their approved list of vets.
Oh.
Well, that's unfortunate, but...
I get it.
Appreciate that.
It's also unfortunate you'll be walking home.
Bye.
Mom?
What are you doin' here?
I was about to head back down to the bar.
Um... you got a second?
If you came to pick up some of them frozen steaks you left here and noticed there were a couple missing', that was Drake.
On his own.

Look, Abby's had a full day, and almost a full keg.
She's passed out on the couch.
What?
Oh.
She'll be fine.

I just think everything with her parents and the baby and you guys hit her all at once.
Shit.
This is all my fault.
- You waiting' for me to argue with you?

What am I supposed to do?

You can't.

I'm trying.

With work and her parents.

How the fuck did this become my life?
Well, would you like me to walk you through it?
'Cause I could draw a diagram with three stick figures and one little stick.
Look, you've created a messy situation.
But you have a good heart.
All right, Colt?
You just follow that.

Thanks, Mom.
Do you smell smoke?
Does Domino's deliver out here?
Oh, my God.

If I can't uncover my eyes, I'm gonna have to use one of your windows as a puke bag.
Okay, just don't look until I tell you.
All right.
You know the water tower where Rooster painted "Fuck Colt"?
Yeah, of course.

Take a left at the "Fuck Colt" water tower, a right on Mill Road, and if you hit the "Colt Sucks" barn, you've gone too far.
Well, we're at the water tower.
The "Colt Sucks" barn is still there?
Oh, no.

- You gotta look at the water tower.

- I don't wanna!

I...

Okay, fine.
"Fuck, Colt loves Abby."
Yeah, I didn't have enough paint to cover up the "Fuck,"
so I just added to it.
This whole situation sucks.
And it also sucks that we live in a town where everyone's gotta know our business.
Now at least they'll know this, too.
It's so sweet, Colt.
And you even put the comma in the right spot.
Honestly, that was just a lucky guess.

But I mean it.
I don't want you to forget it.
Well, I'll be reminded about it every day.
At least until Rooster turns it back to "Fuck Colt."
We're gonna make it through this.
I'll be a good father.
I'll be an even better boyfriend.
Okay, that doesn't sound great.
Right.
I...

Fuck, Abby loves Colt.
Ooh.
