Come back here!
Come back here!
What the hell?
Shit.
You're nothing but a street rat!
I may be a street rat, but I still got your bread, bitch.
Excuse me, excuse me, are you, um...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm the suck boy you're looking for.
You want my time, you got to pay to spray.
Dad?
It's time to come home, son.
You want me to come work for you?
Well, I want you to learn the business.
I'm not getting any younger.
It's time for me to pass the torch.
Hey, has anyone claimed your organs?
I'm not dying, you idiot.
I'm retiring.
I had to ask.
It's a seller's market right now.
Look what you've become.
Do you want to live this way, son?
Covered in manure, selling your body, smoking PCP or whatever it is you smoke.
Oh, come on.
Do I look like a dusthead to you?
You certainly don't look like my son.
Come on.
Give the job a shot, for Christ's sake.
I'll think about it.
I got to pop in here first.
You don't have to go into a dive bar right now.
I'm just gonna clean myself up.
Have a little faith.
My friends have a very nice setup for me to take a shower in here.
In fact, I'm the type of gal who makes men's lives better.
Well, that... don't count that.
That's not a good example.
Ah!
Take me to the angels, baby.
It's time to come home, son.
Maybe it's time to make a change.
All right, uh, this is the loading dock where we, uh, ship our supplies from.
And right here... this is you.
This is nice.
I'm gonna sleep well tonight.
You're gonna sleep at home in a bed.
Hey, hey, hey, Davy, Davy.
I don't even understand why we're doing this.
I didn't wet the bed till I was in high school.
Shut your mouth about that.
You want another noogie?
All right, all right, boys.
His scalp came off on my fingers.
Goddamn it.
Now look here, guys.
We have an important meeting coming up.
It's our biggest account.
And I'm gonna tell them that my boys are taking over the business.
Both of them.
You guys need to get your shit together.
All right.
I got my eye on you, loser.
And you stink like piss, by the way.
It's freakin' bullcrap.
What a jerk.
Huh?
He's always been a hard-on.
He's the one who stinks, by the way.
His shoes smell like rotten eggs.
You smell his shoes?
Calls me a bitch, that kind of thing.
Thus the necklace my mother gave me that I'm currently guilt-wearing.
Belle.
That's a nice name.
I'm Cricket, uh, Matthew.
It's nice to meet you, Matthew.
Hey, date!
Okay.
Hey, boss?
Oh, really?
A magician never reveals his tricks, Cricks.
The answer is no.
Well, you don't go down in negotiation.
Well, now it's $2.50, Crick, so you want the job or not?
I got a new life, so I don't need anything from you.
I mean, yeah, we don't care what you're doing with the money.
Hey, dipshit!
We're not paying you to talk on the phone.
Your drug dealer?
Your skeezy little arrogant douche bag friends down at the bar?
I am so onto you.
And I bet you're gonna be high by the end of the night.
Ooh!
Freakin' bullcrap!
He's getting yelled at.
We need a decision, Cricket.
Mm...
Are we ready to party tonight?
So am I!
Let's just have a good time and get drunk, huh?
Stuff it down with some brown.
Stuff it down with brown.
I loved how you ruined that dad.
Lemons.
But now I'm off drugs, and I actually have a date, so I need the money, I really need the money.
Look, Cricket, I'm sure whatever street mongrel you're dating... she's into lemons, too, so you're good.
And by the way, my name is not Cricket, okay?
My name is Matthew Mara.
What?
He needs the lemons for the scurvy.
After everything I've done, you know?
After everything they've done to me.
Belle?
What are you doing here?
Promise I'm not stalking you.
I'm just out for a walk.
My dad'll be so worried about me, but I just had to get out of the house.
I'm kind of all he's got, so he's become a little overbearing.
You're so funny.
Okay.
Did someone put you up to this?
Nobody put me up to this, okay?
I feel like we have more in common than you think.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Go behind some Dumpster and bang?
I was kind of talking about that date.
There they are!
Davy, Pops.
I met the most amazing girl.
And I owe it all to you, Dad, for giving me a second chance.
You missed it, asshole.
Huh?
Dad, I told you we couldn't trust him.
I will make this right, okay?
He's probably down by his car right now.
Carl Lewis couldn't catch him!
I can.
Mr. Sanderson!
Mr. Sanderson!
Matthew Mara.
Did you just do a flip off that truck?
What did you just say?
I said I guess I'm gonna have to cut... your heart... out of your body.
You see, uh,
I'm from the streets.
And I'm about to poke you full of holes.
He'll do it!
What changed your mind, Tom?
Uh, your son here made a compelling argument.
We will not let you down,
Tom, let's discuss this.
Hey.
What?
Maybe I misjudged you.
Maybe you're not... just some homeless junkie.
Maybe you're my brother.
Sorry I said that about Carl Lewis.
I think I just saved the company.
And probably bad news for me.
I'm running away.
I got to see the world.
I was wondering if you might want to come away with me.
I-I can't.
I mean, this is my life now.
Well, I should go.
Hey, um... could you just help me with my necklace?
I can never seem to get it off.
Sure.
Something to remember me by.
Well, good-bye, Matthew.
Well, here's something to remember me by.
You're making out with my dog!
Dog?
Oh, shit!
Oh, no.
Maybe it's time to make a change.
Nah, I'm gonna smoke it.
Huh.
He's gone.
Way to go, Rickety Cricket.
So, you did exactly what I thought you'd do, you goddamn street rat!
Matt, Matt, goddamn it.
I gave you a shot.
You can't go around doing insane shit like kissing dogs.
You got to put all that nonsense behind you once and for all.
Now, this is my last and final offer.
You cut that bullshit out and come work with me, or you go back on the street and crawl back into that manure pile
I found you in.
So, which is it?
Huh?
Hey, you guys mind if I go in the bathroom and smoke some PCP?
We don't judge, Cricket, we don't judge.
