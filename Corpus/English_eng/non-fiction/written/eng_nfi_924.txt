Last week...
Beef Wellington!
A Gordon Ramsay classic proved too much for Mark...
It's put together in a very slobbish way.
And Avani...
Your puff pastry is just wrapped too loose.
Ending their time in the MasterChef kitchen.
Tonight...
- Uh-oh.

- The top eight...

face the biggest mystery box of the season.
And then...
Gordon:

Go, go, run, run.
It's a MasterChef Junior favorite.
It has to be perfect!
Only the cooks with raw talent...
Get the nigiri done!
It's falling apart.
And the sharpest skills...
Tight as you can.
Will make the cut.
You need to communicate, otherwise it's going to be sayonara for the both of you.
- Welcome, guys.

- Oh, it's a box.

Justise:

Nice to see you all.
Thank you.
I just think that nobody's really seen me yet as a big threat, but I'm one of the most competitive people in this competition.
So, watch out, guys.
Excellent.

With multiple James Beard award nominations, an acclaimed book, and domination of the Southern food scene, all of you, please welcome...
- Chef Edward Lee.

Jasmine:

- How you doing?

He does a whole lot of Southern food, and I love making Southern food in Milton, Georgia.
So I really hope that I'll be able to learn something from him.
I'm thrilled to be in the MasterChef kitchen with all of you young home cooks.
I hope I can teach you something, but what I'm really hoping is that tonight
I will taste some incredible food.
Woo!
Now, before you begin your next challenge, it's time to talk about the elephant in the room, or rather, the giant mystery box.
Under this box is something very familiar to all of you, something you know very well and are comfortable with.
And by some "thing," I actually mean... well, you'll see.
Shayne:

Christina:

Daddy!
Welcome, everybody.

How does it feel to be inside the MasterChef kitchen?
- Great.

Gordon:

- Yes.

Who's taking charge at home now?
- No one.

She is dying to give you guys a hug.
Off you go.

I haven't seen my family in so long.
My dad was really the first person that helped me start cooking.
Love you.

I'm here because of what my dad taught me.
- Where's Adam's family?

- Mom and dad, missed him?

Please, go and give him a big hug.
Having been here for so long, under so much pressure, after all our hard work...
Go get 'em.
All of us just needed some family to help make it this last stretch.
Hey, Dad.
Now, you, young lady, what's your name?
- Journey.

Do you know anyone in this kitchen by any chance?
Justise.
I'm just like, "Oh, my gosh.

Christina:

That I missed her so much and I just love that she's always right there.
She's my best friend, and I'm always trying to be the best role model.
I just want her to see you can do anything you want.
You put your mind to something, you can do it.
Got one family left.

It seems like she's also standing over here.
We're identical twins.
Cydney:

She always likes being the center of attention, but here in the MasterChef kitchen, I stand out, and that makes me really happy.
Now, I know you were just reunited, and I hate to pull you away, but these guys are about to cook.
Family members please head up to the balcony for the best seats in the house.
Christina:

Gordon:

One... two, three.
- Lift.

- Whoa.

There's another box.
Oh, come on.
Blue Apron?
Edward:

Blue Apron is a fresh ingredient and recipe delivery service, that lets mom or dad skip the grocery store by delivering everything you need in the exact right proportions to make seasonal home cooked meals in 45 minutes or less.
In your box tonight, you'll find chicken breast, wild-caught Alaskan salmon, and farm-sourced winter vegetables like carrots, red onion, baby bok choy, butternut squash, cauliflower,
Brussels sprouts, and rainbow chard.
Gordon:

Recipes!

Edward:

Not only does the winner get a huge advantage in the next challenge, the winner will have his or her very own recipe featured on Blue Apron's family plan menu, which will be delivered to families across America
starting tomorrow morning.
Ready to make us a delicious dish?
Yes, Chef!
Your 45 minutes starts...
- now!

Woman:

Man:

Gordon:

Christina:

These home cooks are cooking one dish, but it's meant to be a dish that would appeal to the entire family.
Presentation is going to be key, and find a way to elevate it.
Justise is doing good.
Tonight I'm making pan-seared salmon with a roasted butternut squash, sautéed bok choy, and a cauliflower puree.
You got it.
My dad and my mom both like salmon and my sister likes different textures, so this is all in honor of my family.
Add some salt.
Today I'm making salmon with a cauliflower puree, pan-seared carrots, and an onion mustard sauce.
Look at that.

I love fishing with my mom and dad, so I thought why not do a dish that I know my family would love?
Woman:

I'm making pan-seared salmon with a butternut squash curry, roasted Brussels sprouts, sautéed carrots, and rainbow chard.
My sister's gluten-free and my parents are dairy-free.
I really want to make this dish special for them.
I'm just so happy to have them here.
All right, guys, 27 minutes remain.
- Hello, Jasmine.

What are you cooking for us today?
I wanted to do something that everyone in my family would love.
So I'm making a garlic and lemon chicken breast, with a cauliflower couscous and a sautéed butternut squash.
Who's the most difficult when it comes to cooking for them?
- Is it dad or mom?

But you know what?

- the better you become.

- Good luck.

Thank you.
Done.
- Afnan.

What are you cooking tonight?
I'm making a pan-seared salmon with curried rice pilaf, and braised veggies.
I love the sound of that.
I'm bringing a Bengali twist into this, because my family sacrificed so much for me, so I'm making something my mom and my dad will love.
- Afnan, good luck.

Looking good, Adam.

- How you doing, Adam?

What are you cooking for us today?
I am making a pan-seared salmon filet with a warm rice and rainbow chard salad, and seared bok choy.
My family makes a lot of healthy foods, and I just want to make them proud.
- Young man, good luck.

Good luck, Adam.
- Man:

Fifteen minutes to go.
I am making pan-seared chicken breasts and brown rice with some Swiss chard.
My mom taught me how to cook.

So I'm just happy to cook with her standing right up there.
- Woo!

Ten minutes to go.
Remember, you're looking for MasterChef-worthy finesse tonight.
Peyton, it's looking amazing.
Peyton, what are you making for us today?
I'm making a pan-seared chicken, with Chinese five-spice roasted squash, and rainbow chard.
Edward:

My dad cooks with me the most, and we both love Asian flavors, so I really wanted to make this for him.
- Good luck to you, Peyton.

- Gordon:

You gotta start thinking about the execution, guys.
Let's go.

Wow, exciting.

- A hundred percent.

He's actually taking the salmon and scoring it to make it cook more evenly.
Like, that's a pro move.
Gordon:

It's like she's got a point to prove tonight.
Edward:

- Oh, that looks so good.

Gordon:

Let's go.

Man:

Girl:

Woman:

Gordon:

Judges:

- four, three, two, one.

- Hands in the air!

Gordon:

Make those plates that all families will love.
Absolutely stunning.
Come on, Justise!
Judges:

- And, stop!

Gordon:

Now, as you know, in every mystery box challenge, we taste as you go, we judge everything you do right as it's happening.
Now, there are three phenomenal dishes out there that we'd love to take a much closer look at.
The first dish we'd like to taste... this dish's protein is salmon, executed beautifully.
We're expecting a real burst of flavor.
Please step forward...
Afnan.
Evan:

Afnan:

So this one I have to win, because I want to make my family proud.
Gordon:

Afnan:

Everything was inspired by my mom and dad.
They both love salmon.
My mom loves putting a lot of aromatics in rice.
And my dad just eats it all.

How did you cook the salmon?
I pan-seared it on one side, then I finished it off with butter and lemon on the other.
And the sort of fragrance round the outside, what's on there?
Lemon zest.
First of all, visually, it looks beautiful.
The salmon... delicious.

What would I change?

Just a little touch too grainy.
But you're cooking like a pro, big man.
I'm really glad your parents are here to see this.

Thank you, Chef.
That is fantastic.
That is really, really nice.
The spices on this are fantastic, the rice is cooked perfectly, the vegetables are nice.
But here's the thing with your salmon.
The end piece where it's a little bit thinner is overcooked.
It's a minor point, but it's one thing to consider.
Everything else, wonderful.

You should be proud of yourself.
Awesome job, Afnan!
Christina:

Now, the dish looks like a fully composed masterpiece.
Please step forward...
Justise.
Yeah.
Justise:

This right here is going to get me closer and closer to winning that trophy.
Describe the dish for me.
I've made pan-seared salmon with pan-seared bok choy, roasted butternut squash, and a cauliflower puree.
My sister likes different textures, so I did a cauliflower puree and bok choy, and then my mom loves butternut squash, she loves seafood, and my dad can eat anything I make, so it's all kind of just put together for my whole family.
Okay, let's see how you did on the cook.
Looks good.
The fish looks like it has a nice beautiful cook on it.
Mm, where's that acidity coming from?
Well, in the cauliflower puree,
I did a little bit of lemon zest and the juice.
That lemon zest and lemon juice in the cauliflower puree, for me, seals the deal on this dish.
You've cooked the butternut squash and the bok choy with these really deep, rich notes, and that cauliflower brings this lightness and this acidity that makes it a nearly perfect balanced dish.
The salmon is a hair overcooked, but I'm gonna be talking about that cauliflower puree for a long time, young lady.
- Nice job.

Mm, wow.
- The salmon is cooked beautifully.

The bok choy... caramelized, crispy.

It's soft, it's creamy.

A little bit more acidity, maybe?
A touch of lemon juice on top of the salmon as it comes out the pan.
But let's get one thing right, you did your parents proud tonight, and I think you've done the salmon justice.
Great job.

- Thank you.

Great job, Justise.
Edward:

Please step forward...
Adam.
Adam:

I really tried my hardest to bring my Mediterranean background into this dish, so I'm really hoping that can win this and make my family really proud.
Adam, tell me about your dish.
I made a crispy salmon with a brown rice and rainbow chard salad, a seared bok choy, and an apple cider vinaigrette.
My mom, she grew up in Istanbul, and the rice does have a lot of my Mediterranean roots in it.
You know what I like about this dish?
You've got texture with the Swiss chard within the rice.
So it's creamy, but at the same time, it's crunchy, and the balance between the two is amazing.
The fish is cooked perfectly and the vinaigrette just works beautifully.
If there's any criticism, your vinaigrette could have been a little bit thicker 'cause it'd be nice if it were poured all over the fish and the rice.
Other than that, it's a beautiful, sophisticated dish.
- Hands up.

That bok choy is delicious.

I love your brown rice.
I'd almost say that your vegetables and your rice outshine the salmon itself.
I wish that you would've just done something a little bit more to it, whether it was making lemon salt or some sort of spice.
But overall I think you did a really great job.
Mom, how proud are you of your son?
I'm incredibly proud of him.
- I love you guys.

Love you, too, bud.
- Nice job.

- Good job, guys.

You, too.
Christina:

Christina:

Justise.
- Yeah!

Justise:

Afnan, Adam, please head back to your stations.
And this just shows my sister, no matter what, you can do anything you set your mind to.
Gordon:

Tonight, Blue Apron is giving each of you and your families a year-long subscription to the family plan.
Afnan:

Wow!
Now, I'd like to invite you all down to say good-bye to your incredible young chefs.
Thank you, sister.
Good job, good job.
Amazing.
Bye.
I really, really, really miss my family, and I'm just so glad that we got the chance to see them.
Bye.
I'm just gonna use this moment to really inspire me to make it to the top.
Gordon:

- Bye!

All right, guys, now there's another tough challenge ahead.
Everyone, please come down to the front.
Awesome job.
For your next challenge, we're going international.
Ooh.
Tonight, you'll be making one of the most technical types of cuisine you will find anywhere in the world.
- Beautiful fresh sushi.

Here you have a California roll, tuna roll, nigiri sushi, and, finally, shrimp and vegetable tempura.
A treat for every palette.
Christina:

Gordon:

This is the one and only tag-team challenge.
Oh, no.
Gordon:

Please come and step up here.
First you have to pick which home cook you want on your team.
Um, I'm gonna choose this person because I think that they're gonna bring a flair in the kitchen, and they will definitely listen.

- Ha-ha!

Team number one.
Now we're going into the top six of this competition.
We're getting down to the wire now.
Sadly, you have to forget the word "friendship"
and you have to understand the word "competition."
So make sure there's a reason for the pairing.
Christina:

This team is gonna be a team that we have two strong chefs, but they're both gonna overpower each other.

Interesting.

Right, this second pick picks both teams.
First person is going to Cydney, and we're going to be pairing you with Evan.
I'm putting Evan and Cydney together because they're the youngest.
So I think that they get more stressed, and neither of them will really step up as a team leader.
Gordon:

Now, it's time for all of you to head to your stations.
- Yes, Chef.

Edward:

Christina:

But only one of you is ever cooking at a given time.
When we call "switch," you'll tag out your partner and switch places cooking.
Edward:

You all have 60 minutes to replicate the incredible sushi platter that we presented to you all earlier.
Now, is everybody ready?
All:

Your 60 minutes... starts... now.
- I'm gonna start cutting the avocados.

Jasmine, get the sweet potatoes.

Pour, Afnan!

Be careful.

Guys, this is it.

Edward:

How are these kids gonna do it?
First of all, you need to start slicing your tuna.
Evan, they need to be super thin.

Okay.
Then you start your vegetables.
- Shayne:

Throw the big piece of the potato away.
I know!
Make sure you get the seeds out!
Oh, I can't believe I'm making sushi!
After that, you get the batter made.
Shayne:

- How much?

Gordon:

You haven't started putting shrimp in there, right?
Gordon:

Adam:

All right, I am!
Gordon:

Shayne:

- Okay.

How are you doing?

- I'm rolling it up.

Gordon:

The minute there's silence, game over.
It's good night.
Shayne, when you come up here... avocado.
Slice that nice and thinly.
This good?
No, that's way too big.

No, I think that that's good enough, because it's it's smaller, it won't be able to hold the batter.
We are coming up to one minute until your first switch.
No one has started their nigiri yet, and they're all underestimating how hard it is.
Get the nigiri done!
Nigiri, nigiri, nigiri!
Nigiri!
You need to... you...

What's Afnan got to do now?

He's supposed to do the nigiri.

Oh, no!
Peyton:

- Is he listening?

- Which roll?

The tuna California roll.
At this rate, we'll have nothing done.
Peyton:

Look, there's a swirl in them.
It's supposed to swirl!
- It's a roll!

You need to communicate and get on the same page.
Now!

Otherwise it's gonna be sayonara for the both of you.
Oh...
Afnan, what...

These rolls are not done.

It's supposed to swirl!

You need to communicate and get on the same page.

Otherwise it's gonna be sayonara for the both of you.
Oh...
Come on, Afnan!

I will get it done.
Gordon: 15 seconds until your first swap.
Oh, gosh.

No, Adam, I have to do something.
- I got it!

- Here we go.

- Gordon:

- Come on, let's go!

Jasmine:

Go, go!

- Evan:

Afnan:

It has to be not too thick, and not too thin either.
Guys, I'm so worried.

No one's communicating.
Christina:

- and Afnan...

Come on, Adam!

No, trust me.

I'm worried about Jasmine as well.
Two individuals...

Jasmine:

I know!
Gordon:

Slice them thin.

- Is that good?

20 seconds till the next switch!

- Evan:

You have to roll, tighten, roll, tighten!
I am!
Judges:

- Switch!

- Let's go!

I turned it so you could roll it!
Come one, come on, come on!
No, wait, make sure it's swirling first.
I think Cydney has the finesse to nail this sushi, but they have to believe in themselves and they have to stay focused.

Get your sushi knife and be very gentle.
Justice and Shayne, very controlled.
The beauty of their team is that there is no ego to be checked at the door.
I think that they can go a little bit longer.
I'm gonna go ahead and start and cut the jalapenos.
- But that's a final garnish!

Yeah, but get it slit first.
- Come on, Evan.

30 seconds to go till the next switch!
Peyton:

- Thinly slice the peppers.

Shayne, when you come up here, your main focus is frying.
Get ready!
Judges:

- Get that shrimp out.

Start skewering... skewering that.

- Afnan:

- I need to do the roll.

Edward:

Right now, Adam's working on the inside out California roll.
And I'm just making sure that he's getting everything done perfectly.
I need you to get the shrimps butterflied, okay?
I'll do the butterflying as soon as I get this done.
Adam, come on, that's not gonna take that long.
- Start on the next roll!

I don't think he's listening to me right now.
Edward:

You have to be the voice of reason, okay?
- Yes, Chef.

When you get that roll done, I want you to butterfly the shrimp.
Okay, I'm starting now.
Two minutes until your swap.
Justise, how are you guys doing?
We're doing good.

How are you guys communicating as a team?
Are you the leader all the time?
Yeah, I'm more of the leader, and we're both just really motivating each other.
We really want to push each other.
Okay, keep talking to him, because he needs some help.
He needs some strategy, some motivation.
- Get in there, girl.

When you put 'em in the fryer, hold 'em, drop 'em.
Christina:

What are you gonna do when you get back in?
- Start on the tempura.

Cydney, come on, quickly.
Swirl it around and then drop it.

- Okay, what should I do now?

Put more, put more!

- Here we go.

- I'll fix it, I'll fix it.

- Go!

- Come on, Evan!

- You got it, Jasmine!

Justise:

20 minutes to go, guys.

Cydney:

- Look, like that.

Right, what's done so far?
We have both of the rolls done and we have all the tempura prepared right now.
- Who's finishing?

- Can you do this?

- In your mind, start plotting what you need to do.

And make sure that everything you put on that board is the best you've ever done.
- Yes, Chef!

Gordon:

- They gotta be perfect!

- Okay.

Guys, I did not think they were gonna be as strong as they're actually turning out.
They're communicating well.
Aah!

Come on, we can't go home, Evan.
- Cydney, don't cry.

- Keep it together, Cydney.

Cydney is just crumbling.
Gordon: 30 seconds to go until our last switch!
- Just rub a bit of wasabi.

- Adam, you're gonna have to make the sauce.

- Gordon:

Judges:

- Yeah!

- Go, Peyton!

- Go, go, go!

- Got it!

Just get it all in, Shayne, come on.
- I will.

I know, I'm...

You've got to multitask!

Put it on!
- Good job.

Shayne, get our veggies on the plate.
- Get those scallions cut!

Coming down to the last three minutes to save you and your teammate.

- Justise:

- Come on!

- Faster!

Evan:

Our sauce needs... on the plate!

Gordon: 60 seconds to go!

- Take the sticks up.

- Let's go, let's go!

- Final push!

Oh, this looks horrible.
Cydney, you don't have time.

- Little peppers on top!

- Come on, we got this.

Adam!

- Get them on the plate!

- Push, Shayne!

Shayne, use those muscles!
- Can't.

- Harder!

- Get it on!

Evan:

- Oh, no.

Judges:

Stop!

Gordon:

- Evan:

Judges:

Stop!

- Oh!

Christina:

We now need to take a closer look and taste everything to decide which team has just cooked for the last time in this kitchen.
First up, Adam and Jasmine.
Jasmine and I had some struggles with communication, but in the end, I believe that Jasmine and I were able to come together and make a great plate of sushi, and I hope the judges see that, too.
All right, now, 60 minutes.

- Definitely.

I'm glad that you're smiling now, Jasmine, because the look on your face, it did not look like you were having a good time.
So what was going on?
We had a few difficulties communicating, but we pulled it off, and overall we did a pretty good job.
Okay.

Thank you.
Now, who ended up cooking the shrimp?
Okay, so...

So, Jasmine was cooking the shrimp.
How did you cook the shrimp?
What was in that pot that you poached it in?
We had some lemongrass, salt, and a little bit of Japanese lemon juice.
I think that the nigiri is nice, and on your rolls here, you're looking good.
But I'm gonna be picky and pick out this one and then pick out this one.
- One's super thick and one's super thin.

Now, I think the tempura, you guys got done well.
It has a great coating, it's crunchy.
I gotta give you some love.
You brought us a sushi platter that is stunning.
- Thank you.

Evan:

Cydney:

Next up, Peyton and Afnan, please.

Peyton:

We just weren't listening to each other and our communication was off.
But we at least got everything on the plate.
Okay, Peyton and Afnan, you just spent the last 60 minutes ignoring each other.

Peyton:

I don't think so.
I think the lack of communication messed us up.
Here's what I saw.
Afnan, you refused to listen.
Peyton, every time you were working on your own, you were in a confused state.
Then, the biggest mistake you both made tonight is you started a job and nobody finished it.
I mean, seriously, your platter looks like it's just been returned.
Look at this.

- Who rolled the California roll?

Look at the cuts on it.

Who molded the rice?
- I did.

There's some dabs of wasabi on there.
There's none on there, there's none on there, and there's none on there.
At the end, I had to rush.
Oh, dear.

I did.
- Who fried them?

Tempura's actually quite nice.

Unfortunately, tonight you worked as individuals, and it shows in the platter.
- Great job, guys.

- Thanks.

You... - You got it.
Communication is key in any team challenge, and Shayne and I work well together, we talked as a team, so I'm feeling good about our platter.
It all looks really great...

I would eat it any day.
How are you doing, guys?
Really good, Chef.
Looks great.

Shayne:

I really felt that we did awesome.
I'm gonna go right for these nigiri rolls.
I like the knife cuts.
I love the ratio of the rice to the tuna.
Really nice.

- Look at that shrimp.

Look at that little puny shrimp.
- Watch that ratio, okay?

This roll here encapsulates the very essence of sushi.
The layer of tobiko roe on the outside is perfect.
Justise formed it and then I filled them.
- And then she rolled them.

Check out this tempura.

A bad piece of fried shisa would just kind of droop down.
- And this is standing still.

It's cooked perfectly.

Justise is 11.

Shayne:

I cannot believe this was made by an 11 and a 13-year-old.
Honestly, in this kitchen, age does not matter.
- Kudos to you.

Christina:

Amazing, really good.

- Take the back.

I'm worried, because our team, it just fell apart.
I'm not the loudest, and Cydney was cracking under this pressure.
I just hope we did enough to stay in this competition.
Right.
That... is very sloppy.
Okay, so, uneven slicing.

A mess, a mess, a mess, a mess, a mess, a mess.
- What is that?

That is not good.

That was me, Chef.
Why would you put it on there?
I'd rather you just leave it off.
Who put that on there?
- Evan.

That's big enough to be a wheel on the front of my bicycle.
Dear, oh, dear.
- Who poached the shrimp?

- How long for?

And what in?
In ginger and salted water.
The shrimp is delicious.

Thank you.
- Who made the batter?

The batter is really crispy.
- The shrimp cooked beautifully.

But I have to judge you on what you're giving me.
- Yes, Chef.

I see nothing precise there.

It's like a nightmare on a slate.
Sorry, Chef.
Evan and Cydney,
Japanese cuisine is all about precision, and I see nothing precise there.
It's like a nightmare on a slate.
Don't be upset.
You're a very smart, clever, technical cook.
Sometimes in my kitchen, I've felt like crying, but I had to push through.

You just have to be strong.
Evan and Cydney, I've seen you plate food in this competition so far that's breathtaking, but I'm going to be honest, okay?
And I say it because I want you guys to do well.
That platter of sushi is a mess.
- Thank you.

Gordon:

It's okay, Evan.

All right, this was a tough challenge and we are very proud of all eight of you.
Now, let's start with the good news.
The team with the best sushi platter of the night...
Adam and Jasmine.

- Please, head up to the balcony.

Jasmine:

I am really proud of Adam and I.
I am so excited!

The second team that's safe from elimination...
Shayne and Justise.
Off you go.

- Yes!

Oh, sorry, Jas.
Now, sadly, for one team of two, the MasterChef journey will end here.
Please, all make your way down to the front.
Afnan:

My heart is racing.
I hope the judges remember my spices, my flavors, and how far I've come in this competition.
Gordon:

All four of you know those platters were subpar and they were nowhere near MasterChef worthy.
Peyton, Afnan, you two are incredibly talented.
But tonight you did not work as a team and it showed.
Cydney, Evan, you both have done brilliantly well in this competition, but you clearly struggled, and I don't think you knew what you were doing tonight.
Afnan and Peyton, please step forward.
Peyton and Afnan... your time is over in the MasterChef kitchen.
I'm so sorry.
- It's so sad.

You're my best friend.
Oh, dear.

You've done well, both of you remember what you've achieved in this kitchen.
Keep your heads up high and promise me you're going to continue cooking.
Yes, Chef.
Come and say good-bye, please, both of you.
Take care, love.
Chef, come on, you.
Oh, man.
Edward:

You're a great chef.

Take care, and promise me you'll wear those aprons with pride, okay?
- Yes, Chef.

Afnan:

Yes!
But I made it into the top eight.
You clearly were born to cook.
Thank you, Chef.
And I know I made my family proud.
The dish of the night...

Peyton:

I did not have as much confidence, but now I can cook anything.
That, young lady, is cooked to perfection.
Your macaroon, it's punchy, and those berry flavors?
Pretty darn delicious, Peyton.
Cheers?
Snowball fight!
I've had so much fun here...
Gordon:

And I've made amazing friends.
The Red Team!

I got iced by the Gingerbread Man... and I also loved cooking for famous guest judges.
Oh, my gosh.

Thank you.
Afnan:

I'm going to open a modern bistro.
I'm going to go back to New Jersey,
I'm going to wear my apron, and I'm going to cherish this experience for the rest of my life.
Bye!
Announcer:

Holy cow!
But next week, an extra serving of "MasterChef Junior."
Awesome.
We show you the best bits from the past five seasons.
The thrills...
- the spills...

and we track down some of our past contestants...
Now I'm a teenager.
To see what they're up to.
Now I'm able to drive, which is crazy.
An extra serving, on FOX, next week.
Hanna:

- Go.

The teams got a change of scenery.
We're going to the beach.
Elaine:

Brady opened up about his past.
You know, and if I'm single for the rest of my life,
I'm totally fine with that.
You deserve to be happy in a relationship.
Battle lines were drawn.
We're going to go with Jason and Elaine.
Elaine:

Hannah:

Three, go.
Then later, the bottom two teams got a big surprise.
Neither team will be going home.
Yeah, baby!

Hannah:

And Terry and Natalie held on to their last chance at power.
Four teams continue to fight for half a million dollars.
Who will the jungle claim tonight on...
Terry and Natalie!
Yes, yes.
Great to see you!

Oh, my gosh.
We've got to tell you stuff and...
Let's go.

This is never good.
So, we won, and we come back with the ultimate power.
The ultimate power means we are the last ones to get to choose
- Yep.

The last power.

What?
So wait, wait, wait, wait.

What the hell is going on here?
Everybody's still in.

- Um.

You're not in the final three anymore.
We're all still here.
We're still here.

Only one team of the four will win a half a million dollars.
The anxiety is actually building as we get closer and closer and closer to the end.
That's smoke, man.
It's great for killing the nasty smell in your clothes.
Kills the bacteria.
- Really?

Well, what do we do, Terry?
See, I want to play a game in the water and nobody wants to play.
Natalie:

So, day one, coming here, I had not been outside in a long time.
Oh, my goodness.
Wow.
What?
Piece of wood.
- What are you all eating?

But now, I love this place called outside.
We can turn Ben into a mermaid.
- Turn Terry into a mermaid.

- Terry, can we turn you into a mermaid?

- Okay, yeah.

Screw you, Ben.

Oh, baby, I've been looking forward to this.
- Need some mounds right about there.

Terry:

Am I looking good?
These are ginormous mermaid boobies.
Yeah, baby.
Attitude is everything.
The boys in my troop are going to laugh their butts off at this.
Oh, he's a merman.
No, Ben!

- You guys aren't going to leave me here yet.

- See ya, buddy.

- Have fun.

- The tide's coming in.

- We're getting kind of hungry.

- Should we go eat?

- Guys?

Ow, crabs.
Hey, Brady.
Yeah, I think you've got fish on.
There's something going on with your pole.
Oh, you got something.
Woo.
Got something on there, yeah.
I want to see.
- Holy.

Pull it in, pull it in.
It's a shark.
Holy!

I ain't going in that water no more.
No, wait!

- What?

Are you serious?
- No, let them go.

We're eating this.
Shark is awesome.
It's so good, too.
It's better than almost anything you can catch out here.
Ooh, manly.

I grew up in Costa Rica.
