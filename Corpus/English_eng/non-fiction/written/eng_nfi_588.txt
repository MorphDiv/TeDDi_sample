50 years have passed.
But I do not age.
Time has lost its effect on me.
Yet the suffering continues.
Aku's grasp chokes the past, present, and future.
Hope is lost.
Samurai Jack.
5x04 - "XCV"
Aaagh!
No.
Murderer!
They chose!
I will undo the evil that is you, samurai!
Long live the glory of Aku!
You are very troubled.
And very confused.
Aku is the evil one, not me.
I've met machines that are programmed with such hate and lies, but never a human.
Now you're just repeating yourself.
I wonder if it is possible for her to ever believe
Mm, perhaps not.
Are you kidding me?
Whew.
My Lord and master, Aku, may it please you for all eternity ... the samurai is dead.
You're dead.
But once you see how misguided you are, you will see the truth about Aku.
Be still!
Crazy woman!
Can you not see that I am saving your life?
Aaaaaagh!
Uh, hello?
Waiting.
Waiting for what?
She's pure evil.
She's lost her way.
You'd know about that, wouldn't you?
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
Well, then, maybe you'll talk to me.
Leave me alone.
I don't want to talk to you, either.
I don't know why you keep bringing this up.
Look, why do you always have to get involved?
She chose her way, and now she has to live with the consequences.
You'll never understand that it's all my fault!
She's here because of me.
No.
Ugh, you're going to save her life again, aren't you?
Yes.
You're welcome.
I'd be happier as that creature's excrement than be grateful to you.
What did you expect, a hug and a kiss?
By Aku's will, you will die in here.
There is no hope for you, foolish samurai.
Aku is the master of masters and will end you!
No matter what you have planned for me,
I will never buckle, never waiver.
Aku has made a world of wonders, and you have soiled it!
Aku is the father of all fathers!
His greatness cannot be measured!
You are a parasite, samurai, feeding off Aku's generosity!
Aku, my master, this fool knows not of your greatness, your kindness,
Every thing, every word, every thought that you know... is wrong!
He has destroyed mother nature!
Aku has unleashed these monstrosities upon our world, and they feed off his carnage.
But if you open your eyes and let go of the hate, you will see the truth.
Die.
Rain?
Well, um...
I guess we should get this over with.
You know, uh, many people pay money for this.
It's called acupuncture.
Never mind.
Whew.
We're close.
Even in the bowels of the darkest of creatures, there is beautiful light.
Whew.
We're slowing down.
Wait!
Ashi.
These frivolous distractions are poisons for your mission.
They are not part of Aku's order.
Not part of Aku's order...
