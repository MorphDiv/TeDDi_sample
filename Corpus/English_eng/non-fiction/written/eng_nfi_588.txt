OFFRED:

DOCTOR:

Most of those guys are.
If Waterford can't get you pregnant, they won't blame him.
It'll be your fault.
I can help you.
It's too dangerous.
OFFRED:

That's what he needs.
It has been so hard.
Being alone in that room.
I'm afraid I'm starting to give up.
That would be a tragedy.
The accused stand charged with gender treachery, in violation of Romans.
I know this is a shock for you, Emily.
Things will be easier for you now.
You won't want what you cannot have.
Fuck!
NICK:

You can't change anything about this.
It's gonna end the same no matter what you do, so there's no point trying to be tough or brave.
Everybody breaks.
Everybody.
WATERFORD: (SIGHS) Very nice.
Thank you.
Not even close.

I got lucky.
Maybe you're just learning my weaknesses.
Maybe.
I'll have to be more careful.
What's the fun in that?
OFFRED:

I've learned that he likes it when I flirt.
And I like it when he lets me win.
We're a match made in heaven.
It reminds me of a poem I read once.
"You fit into me like a hook into an eye
"a fish hook an open eye"
(DRAWER CLOSING)
I have a present for you.
Those were all destroyed.
Some of us retain an appreciation for the old things.
I thought you might like to read it.
It's not allowed.
It is with me.
OFFRED:

I read them when I got my hair highlighted.
Now the models all look insane.
Like zoo animals.
Unaware they're about to go extinct.
"Ten ways to tell how he feels about you.
"Number one,
"he brings you small gifts."

Good surprise?
Yes, thank you.
(CHUCKLES)
That look on your face is thanks enough.
(LAUGHING)
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)
No.

Oh, God, no.
You're too picky.
June, what?
Come on, man.

(LAUGHS) You kidding?
Beggars, choosers.

Shut up and show me your profile pic.
Okay.
You better not have on a fedora.
(BOTH LAUGH)
Hold on.

Good!

What do you mean?

That's a nice photo!
Watch this.

Hi.

(CHUCKLING)
MOIRA:

Quick question.

My friend's on Tinder.
You on Tinder?

No?

Okay.

What?

I think it's because of her profile pic, and I just wanted to get an objective male opinion.
Sorry.

Ah...
Yeah.

Yeah, it's nice.

Nice is chump bait.

No, no, no, no!
You have to help me find something better than this.
No.

Relax, I'm not going to show him your nudies.
Seriously?

Sorry.

Hey, I mean, don't look at me.
I'm just waiting for my hot dog, you know.

Good.

(BOTH LAUGH)
I'm just...

Who are those?

They're my cats.
Cute.

Yeah.

Yeah?
He's very thorough.

That one.

Uh-oh.

No.

Oh, look wait.

No, that's a very interesting choice.
Yeah, because you look...
You look invincible.
MAN:

Oh, that's-- that's me.
All right.

No, my pleasure.

Bye, cutie.

So cute.

He does not act married.

Thank you.
Blessed day.
(SLURPS)
RITA:

No.
Must be nice.
(TAP WATER RUNNING)
OFFRED:

Number two.
He keeps finding ways to accidentally run into you.
Number three.
What was number three?
Offred?

Yes, Mrs. Waterford.
OFFRED:

Or she found the writing in the closet.
Or maybe it's the magazine?
Any way you slice it, I lose a hand.
SERENA JOY:

Too much and the plant will rot.
(SIGHS) Okay.

OFFRED:

There are things I could do.
How hard would I have to press those shears into her neck before seeing blood?
Nothing yet?
No.

Well, that's bad luck.
Your time is running out here.
You don't want to be sent to the Colonies, do you?
(BUSHES RUSTLING)
(EXHALES)
Maybe he can't.
(WIND WHOOSHING)
(WHISPERING) The Commander.
I was thinking maybe we could try another way.
I'm sorry.

(INHALES)
I mean, with another man.
It's...

Officially, yes.

I'm sure you've heard the stories.
I've heard rumors about...
Doctors.
Yes.
Some women do it that way.
But it should be with somebody we trust.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
I was thinking of Nick.
Nick?
Yeah.

Nick is loyal, and he's been with us for a very long time.
What about the Commander?
Forget about the Commander.
All right.
All right.
Good.
Good.
(SIGHS)
We'll do it this afternoon after the shopping.
May as well strike while the iron is hot.
Will you bring that in for me?
Yes, Mrs. Waterford.
(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)
(MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS)
(INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER PA SYSTEM)
JANINE:

Oh, it's so cute.
And she sticks out her tongue sometimes like this.
Ah.
You really shouldn't talk about that stuff, Ofwarren.
Hater.
Under His eye.
Always blessed.
Did you see?
ALMA:

(INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER PA SYSTEM)
OFFRED:

May the Lord open.
OFFRED:

(SIGHS)
Right.
It's so good to see you.
Are you okay?

We were worried.

The Eyes took you?
Nick, our driver, is he one of them?

I don't know.
But you said there was an Eye in the house.
I don't know anything anymore.
After what happened, I'm too dangerous to be part of it.
Part of what?
Mayday.
Mayday?

There you are.
Hiding out in the vegetables.
(BIRD CAWING)
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
Don't do that again.
What do you mean?
I mean Ofsteven.
I'm not going to let you mess this up for me.
This isn't messed up?
You're cute.
You used to do yoga classes...

And your man liked to cook?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You guys had a first floor walk-up, down Back Bay, with a garden.
Had yourself a Nordstrom's card, right?
I liked Anthropologie.

I used to get fucked behind a dumpster just so I could buy a sixth of Oxy and a Happy Meal.
I'm clean now.
I've got a safe place to sleep every night and I have people who are nice to me.
Yeah.

All right.
And I want to keep it that way.
Whatever they did to Ofsteven, that's not gonna happen to me.

Mmm-hmm.
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Ready?
Yes, Mrs. Waterford.
(DOG BARKING IN THE DISTANCE)
OFFRED:

Barring the possibility of violent arrest, it's nothing I haven't done before.
So how come this time it feels like I'm cheating on Luke?
LUKE:

JUNE:

Yeah, but it hasn't even snowed yet.
They say it may not at all this year.
Well, that's depressing.
When I was in college, I used to go to the English department to study.
And there was a fireplace, and it was warm.
I was all by myself.
That sounds safe.

Yeah.

Mmm-hmm.
(CLICKS TONGUE AND INHALES)
So, uh, in college, did you and Moira ever...
Did we ever what?
You know, did you ever...
What, do you think all girls just go through a gay phase?
No, look, it's just you two are very close and you're both very attractive and, in my experience, these things sometimes happen.
Your experience as a lesbian?
All right, forget it.
Or your experience as a college girl?
I retract the question, okay?
(LAUGHING)
No!
No, for the record.
I actually haven't even told Moira that we've been having lunch and hanging out.
I don't know why.

I feel like she'd be...

Hmm.
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Yeah, I don't tell Annie either.
Really?
What do you say?
I just-

(CHUCKLES)
I mean, it's just...

We're not even doing anything.

With four adorable children.

(BOTH LAUGH)
Where would we even go, you know?
Uh, where would we go?
We couldn't go to my place.

What do people in the movies do?
(LAUGHS) In the movies?

Yes.
Yeah, they get a room.

Yeah, we could get a room.
(CHUCKLING)
Some, like, um...
Dirty... (LAUGHS) (LAUGHING)
Pay-by-the-hour...

Place.

Gross.

No, it could be fun.

(LAUGHS) Think about it.
We could go to the Hyatt.
Hmm.
Yeah.
One of those, you know, higher rooms with a view of the city at night.
So, how would it work?

Come surprise you after work, or...
No.
No, never.
No surprises.

Right.

Yes, file the papers.
Right.

No, I mean, I need to...

Um...
Pick out some lingerie.
What, you know what you'd wear?
I have ideas.
It's not gonna happen, though.
No.

No. (BREATHING DEEPLY)
(EXHALES)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Hello, Nick.

(DOG BRAKING OUTSIDE)
So, uh, do we pray first?
No.

Please.
(FLOORBOARD CREAKING)
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
(METAL CLANKING)
(SIGHS)
(CLEARS THROAT)
You want to see what's on TV?
No, that's...

Do you?

I'm good.
Are you sure?
Is this one crooked?
Yeah.
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
Wait.

Yeah?

Ah, that's not really...

That's not good?

All right.

(LAUGHING)
Thanks. (GIGGLING)
(WHISPERING) That's really nice of you.
Yeah, I'm a giver.

(SIGHS)
All clear.
You should go and lie down now.
How do you feel?
Do you feel any different?
You don't just feel pregnant 30 seconds after a man cums.
I'm sorry, forgive me.
Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee.
And before thou camest out of the womb, I sanctified thee, and ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.
Go and lie down.
(FLOORBOARD CREAKING)
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
(PANTING)
GRACE:

May the Lord open.
(CHUCKLES) He's so happy to have someone to play with.

(DOG BARKS)
(LEAVES RUSTLING)
You know, I'm not feeling very well.
I might be getting the flu.
Maybe we should skip tonight's Ceremony.
What do you think?
You can't be sick every month.
No.
I can't.
(DOG PANTING)

Don't look at me like that, please.
Can she see him doing this?
Can she feel him?

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
WATERFORD:

Care for a drink?
A game?
OFFRED:

Do what?

I didn't mind it.
I don't think you did either.
What if she saw you?
She could have me sent to the Colonies or worse and you know that.
I understand.
I'm sorry, all right?
Okay.
WATERFORD:

(GLASS CLINKING) You think?
You sure you wouldn't care for a drink?
No, thank you.
All right.
How about a read?
No.
You miss this?
Lists of made-up problems.
No woman was ever rich enough, young enough, pretty enough, good enough.
(CHUCKLES)
We had choices then.
Now you have respect.
You have protection.
You can fulfill your biological destinies in peace.
(PAGE TURNS)
Biological destiny?
Children.

Love.
Love?
Yes.
(CHUCKLES)
Love isn't real.
It was...
Never anything more than lust with a good marketing campaign.
Maybe for you but not for me.
What did you say?
Nothing.
Remember Ofglen who used to live next door?
Ofglen had urges that led her to do unnatural things.
I'm sure, to her, it felt like love.
In cases such as these, the punishment is death.
But, out of respect for her position, we let her live.
We're not without compassion.
What did you do to her?
We helped her.

We had a doctor take care of the problem.
It's such a small problem, truth be told.
Every love story is a tragedy if you wait long enough.
(BREATHING SHAKILY)
I should go.
Suit yourself.
We only wanted to make the world better.
Better?
Better never means better for everyone.
It always means worse for some.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS)

(SNIFFLING) What are you doing here?
Huh?
You spying on me?
I was just looking for something to eat.
Are you an Eye?
Go to bed.
Do you know...
What they did to Ofglen?
Yes.

Do you know because...
You're one of them?
You shouldn't be down here.
Don't tell me where to go.
NICK:

Please don't tell me what to do.
I couldn't say no when Mrs. Waterford asked me.
I'm sorry.
(GULPS)
I'm sorry.
(GULPS)
Just tell me.
(SHAKILY) Okay, please?
Please.
Are you an Eye?
Yes.
Hmm.
Now go to bed before I report you.
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)
Okay.
(EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)
I want you to leave your wife.
Okay.
Wait, really?
What do you mean, "Okay"?
Look, I'm in love with you.
(CHUCKLES) What else am I going to do?
(WHISPERS) I'm in love with you.
(VEHICLE APPROACHES)
(DOOR OPENS)
Those are beautiful lilies.
I'm allergic.
My eyes, like, swell up.
I think my companion might like them.
OFSAMUEL:

They're really pretty.
Come on, this way.

Hi.
I know what they did to you.
I'm so sorry.
Ofglen.
I'm not Ofglen.
I know.

OFGLEN 2:

Yes, of course.
Mayday can't use me anymore.
But you can help them.
Who are they?
They're fighting back.
Find them.
Ofglen...

My name is Emily.
Who are you?
You are going to come by the lilies and you are going to stay by the lilies.
JANINE: (LAUGHING) It makes her sound like an old man.
OFERIC:

MAN:

I said, halt!
Open!
Open the door!

Hey!

This is your last warning!

It'll be okay.
We're gonna look out for each other.
OFFRED:

Luke told me once where the term came from.
It's French.
M'aidez.
"Help me."
(MAN TALKING ON RADIO)
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(THUDDING)
Offred, is that you?
I heard there was a bit of trouble in town.
Yeah.
A bit.
Are you all right?
Mmm-hmm.
I'm fine.
Good.
Some women can't handle the requirements of their position.
They can't do what needs to be done.
You understand what I'm saying?
Yes, Mrs. Waterford.
You're a smart girl.
OFFRED:

There was something inside her that...
They couldn't take away.
She looked invincible.
