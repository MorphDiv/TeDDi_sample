As Long As You Love Me

As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
I'm under pressure
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together,
Smile on your face even know your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl,
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances
As long as you love me We could be starving
We could be homeless We could be broke
As long as you love me I'll be your platinum
I'll be your silver I'll be your gold
As long as you love
Love me Love me
As long as you love
Love me Love me
I'll be your soldier fighting every second of the day for the change girl
I'll be your hova
You can be my Destiny's Child on a stinger
So don't stress, don't cry
We don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand
As you love me We could be starving
We could be homeless We could be broke
As long as you love me I'll be your platinum
I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love
Love me, love me
As long as you love me
Love me, love me
I don't know if this makes sense But you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, and I'll rendezvous,
And I'll fly you to it, I'll beat ya there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust...

Now we are on top of the world Cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit Now the sky's is our point of view
Man now we stepping out like wow (Oh God) Camera's pointed shoot
Ask me what's my best side I stand back and point at you
You, you the one that I argue with I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered,
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it So I know we got issues baby true true true
But I'd rather work on this with you Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As you love me We could be starving
We could be homeless We could be broke
As long as you love me I'll be your platinum
I'll be your silver I'll be your gold
As long as you love
Love me
As long as you love me
Love me
As long as you love me
Love me
As long as you love
Love me, love me
As long as you love
Love me, love me
As long as you love
Love me, love me
As long as you love me
