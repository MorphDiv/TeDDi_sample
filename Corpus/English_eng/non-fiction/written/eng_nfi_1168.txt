Artie.
- Artie.

- What are you doing?

You're a weirdo.

I...

You don't just let yourself in.

You trying to give me a heart attack?
- I'm sorry, man.

I don't have anywhere to go, Artie.
It was either this or the Port Authority.
But what are you doing here?

I was fired, okay?
- I was fired.

That's amazing.

What happened?

- I was doing warm-up for Rachael Ray.

- I go out, regular crowd.

- I'm cooking, I'm cooking.

There's an older woman, and I...

- I did some blue material.

It was Rachael Ray's mom.
You messed with Rachael Ray's mom?

And then they yelled at me, and I'm fired, and I don't have my job anymore, and I'm back at your house.
All right.

Maybe give a man a heads up if the mother of the star of the show is gonna be in the audience.
Yeah, okay, okay.
It's... it's on them.

I...

- I'm gonna finish it.

I'm taking this the fuck outta here.

It's Mike's Hard Lemonade.

Dude, I'm an alcoholic.

What the fuck?

Artie, Hannah Montana would drink Mike's Hard Lemonade, because we've let her slip into Miley Cyrus.
- Right.

She used to be pure, she used to be golden light, and now she's out there licking poles and children at the Teen Choice Awards get a look right at her vagina.
Yeah, you know, listen.

I don't understand why we're eating breakfast here.
Why can't we eat breakfast in a strip club?
That was...

Hey, sweetie.

Where's that smile I ordered?
There's an ass right by your head.
Yeah, that's the point, you know.
Well, look at it.

I don't see anything.

That is an odd choice, man...
Between me and a woman's ass, I mean.
This isn't helping breakfast.
Wow!

- I happen to be a very sexual person.

I just don't flap it around like a dick in the wind.
Is that your type?

If I was in the privacy of my own home with this,
I would have wonderful, consensual sex with this woman if we went out 12 to 14 times.
You can have consensual sex with any of these women as long as you give them, like, $400.
What's really weird is I was supposed to be at a baptism today.
Well, why would you want to go to a baptism?
My roommate from college, his wife went through the whole thing.
She's getting baptized today.
Why do you still talk to your college roommate's wife?
I don't talk to my sister anymore.
- Sweetie, come here.

- Hi.

- Come here.

My buddy here is not that experienced.
- Give him an education.

- Whatever...

Shut up.

- Fine, but I'm doing this under protest.

- Hi.

You're dancing with a hot chick under protest.
- I don't know what to do with you, man.

Clearly.

Okay.
Go get 'em, buddy.
- Just sit down.

- It's like Jambi's house.

It's not as soft as I thought it would be,
- but...

Okay.
Now, tell me what you like.
Oh.

Matt Damon.
I love breakfast for dinner.
It's great.

- Just relax.

I didn't know there was, uh...
This is... this is the lap part then.
- Mm-hmm.

Mmm.

- Yeah.

- I...

- Yeah?

There's so many signs that say "no touching."
Oh, that's okay.
Your friend ordered off menu.
- What's your name?

- Mmm.

- Okay.

- Do you like that?

- Isn't this fun?

Yeah?
- Pete.

Sorry.

Sorry.

- Degrading?

- For who?

For me?
You are... you're being degraded, right?
- Excuse me?

What the fuck do you do for a living?
I'm a...

- Oh shit.

Oh.

- and that's okay?

No one's a fucking bigger degenerate than a comic!
I used to date Jim Norton.

- I...

- You got a parking spot?

I make $1,400 a night.

- Uh...

Tell jokes at fucking Yuk Yuk's in Calgary?
- What?

You think you're funnier than Katt Williams?
I don't do that kind of humor.

Every motherfucker and their mother has a one-hour special.
There's more demand, because people have an appreciation for the art form.
It don't mean dick!
Comedy died with Richard Pryor.
You know what?

We got three more songs, and I don't wanna hear nothing else no more.
- Okay.

Spank it, you Jim Gaffigan rip-off!
What?
I'm gonna give you some balls before you leave here.
Okay, that didn't feel good.
See you later.
Oh...

Shit.
So, where to now?
I feel worse.

What are you talking about, "liked that"?

- You don't like that?

Where the fuck are you from?

You never been to a legs and eggs before.
I'm a bad friend, Artie.
I should be with my friend today.
- I should be at the baptism.

You want to go to a baptism?
I'm a comedian.

I got tons of hours to kill during the day.
- Hey, Artie.

Hey!

- How you doing?

Good to see you, buddy.

It's the best time to come.

The girls need you more than you need them.
You really fucking drive down prices before noon.
Good news.

- Oh.

- Nice meeting you.

Is there air conditioning under that tent?
No, it's outside.

Pay attention.

I gotta pay attention?
I'm beginning to feel like I'm on the opposing team's court.
Thank you, Lord, for this...
Dude, I'm freaking out.

- After the service or before?

These are good people.

They'll be very nice to you.

- Pete?

What's up, man?

- Nice to see you.

- Ellen, hi.

- Nice to see you.

- Hi.

- How you doing?

- Take care of yourself.

- Elf?

- He's in Elf.

- It's a great film.

We call it "movie night."
And who's this?
- Can you say hi, Penny?

- "I'm Penny."

- Yeah.

Oh my goodness.

Uh-oh.

Yeah.
Just pull her dress down, Peter, in the back.
Yeah.

This is amazing.

Getting baptized.

It's been an eventful year.
I just think this is a really good time to hit reset and just rededicate myself to the Lord.
Wow.

Just behind... behind her head.

The butt and the head.

Okay, all right, Peter.

- Okay, we'll take her back.

- Okay.

- My God.

- Okay, sorry.

- Speaking of.

- Nice to see you, Steven, Ellen.

- Thanks so much.

I hope that's not a new dress.
- Now that is a comedian.

- Pete, we should catch up.

- You wanna...?

Yeah, sure, great.
"Bye, Peter.

- Bye, Penny.

So, what's up?

- I'm...

Yeah.

Just, you know, you hear things.
I don't know what people have been saying, but...
Hey, that's... that's fine.

I just wanted to bring you in and offer you some support, and I'd love to lift you up in prayer, if that's okay.
Yeah, of course.

Great.

Heavenly Father, we want to thank you for this glorious day and this opportunity to sit down with our brother Peter and help him through this trying and wicked, debaucherous time.
You are with us... especially when we need you the most.
- Yes, Lord.

- for food, Lord, we ask...

I...

- That... that's not...

You were wearing ragged clothes, and...
- No.

I...

- Okay.

Dear God, we ask that you forgive Peter for sins, for laws he may have broken, especially laws involving arson, also the laws that don't involve arson.
- Okay, no.

Again, I haven't broken any laws.
Okay, Adam Johnson, he reads the police blotter, and he told me that there was a fire at your house, and you fled the scene.

I didn't...

There... there wa...

Jess and I, and there was a fire, but I didn't flee the scene.

Okay.
...and the fire was extinguished.
Are you doing drugs?
Am I...

Okay, Stacey Chase said she saw you tweet about having the munchies.

I smoked some pot, yeah.
Can we...

- Okay, let's just finish this up then.

- All right?

Pete's marriage has fallen apart.
- Yes, Father.

Jess had an affair.
Oh, sorry, I thought you were gonna stop me again.
That one's correct, yes.
Lord, forgive Peter for forcing his wife into the arms of another man.
Is it true that you walked in on her with two men?
- No.

- That wasn't us.

Can you wrap it up?

I...

You know, Jess is here today.
- She is?

- How you doing?

- Having a good time?

Are you kidding?

- I'm Artie, by the way.

Nice to meet ya.
You with anybody or hanging out?
Oh, just hanging out.
Hey, uh... how does this work?
I thought they only baptized babies.
- Well, I mean, some churches do.

We prefer it when people can make their own big decisions,
- so we do it with adults...

...kind of like John the Baptist with Jesus.
Oh.

Good guy, John the Baptist.
Not a lot of career options with that name, John the Baptist.
It's like my cousin, Joe the Foot.
He's a foot?
- He's got one foot.

I'm gonna go sit down.

So, I'll see you later then for sure, right?

This is free, I hope.

- Hey.

Sorry, I...

- Well...

Well, no, I'm here to support Ellen.
- Ellen?

I thought you hated Ellen.
I mean, I kinda do, but she invited me, so...
I'm here for Steve.
- Where's Leif?

- It's...

It's over.
- Oh, my God.

I thought it was this whole other thing, and then he said he was leaving his wife, but he was still with her, so...
Are they...

One assumes.
I'm so sorry.
Then she called and threatened me, so she has my number, which has been really fun.
Wow.
I've spent a lot of the past week... fantasizing about you guys breaking up, but now I just feel terrible for you.
That's weird.

I don't know.
It's... not exactly what I thought out there, you know?
- Really?

Hello, everyone!

Before we begin today's journey,
I want to invite all of you to a game of TAG.
- He still does this?

Laughs every time.
No, I mean some T-A-G, "Time Alone with God."
Let's take advantage of these beautiful grounds.
I want everyone to take a walk and clear your minds, open your hearts to what's about to happen.
So, I'll see you all in a few minutes
Please return at the sound of the triangle.
- Jess...

Could, uh, could we do this whole "walk in the woods" thing together?
I...

It gets in my head, and then I go to a bad place.
- Hold on, Artie.

Yeah.

Jess.

Do you, uh, do you mind if I walk with you?
Time alone with God, right?
Feels familiar.
Yeah, I feel like a tourist.
Like, this used to be our life, you know.
I'm sorry, I feel like I need to do this alone.
Oh.

No, I just...

You know, being back here and seeing all these people just reminds me of what I used to have and what I want.
I don't know.
Excuse me.

Hey.

- Hey.

Not a big woods guy, so thank you.
These things are valuable here.
Ah.
Thank you.
Oh, that feels good.
The cigarette after lunch is like one of the 40 best cigarettes of the day.
- Can I ask you something?

Come on.

- Come on.

I don't know.

You want to know how I'm buying into all this?
You seem like a reasonable person.
You seem rational, right.

Yeah, I wanna know if it's real or if it's bullshit, because if it's real, I gotta talk to ya.
I don't know.

Leave me alone!
- Hey!

- Get away from me!

- You're scaring me!

Oh God.
- Huh?

- What are you doing here?

You're not answering my calls, Jess.
Of course I'm not answering your calls.

I had to follow you to talk to you.
- What is he doing here?

We're members.

Okay.

- Peter, Jess...

I have to say I'm so, so sorry.
I made a huge mistake.

- that I talked to my wife.

I'm so sorry it took so long, but she is a scary human being.
She would grab me, be physical with me, and toss me around, and I had to take it.
I don't know what abuse is, but I'm pretty sure she abused me.
I met his wife.

You're a fucking hippie douche bag.
What were the last seven months, Jess?
This started seven months ago?
It wasn't serious for that long.
Oh, just casual adultery?
You're in the program, right?
What makes you think I'm in the program?
- Well, I'm looking at your face.

You look like you snorted the Big Book.
Oh!

I run into Don Rickles in the woods.
- Are you in the program?

It's not helping me, obviously, and clearly something's helped you.
I...

I mean, come on, you know about the higher power.
That's the one part I could never buy into.
Why not?
Because what is...

Higher power?

- It's the easiest part.

It's about letting go and not holding onto something.
- It's just letting go.

I mean, I don't know.

Who made all this?

That's the best argument, I guess.
I don't know, but to me, we could be on the set of Jurassic Park.
- You know?

Yeah, but it wouldn't be God.
It would be, you know, teamsters and a couple of guys in the Carpenter's Union who Spielberg knows.
My point is, there's an explanation for everything.
- This could be man-made.

Oh.

I need a real relationship!

Explain our love.
I was in a trance and now I'm out of it.
We just had good sex together, and that was confusing to me, 'cause I'd never had an orgasm before, and that's what was really messing with my mind.
But it was just an orgasm!
Our 11-hour sessions are one of the deepest, most ritualistic experiences of love I've ever had, and I need that with you, forever.
My friends think I'm like a wicked fucking idiot who had sex with the hand-turkey guy!
You're not even a real artist, okay?
- I'm an idiot for fucking you!

That all hurts, and I thank you for having the courage to give it to me, but whatever person you need me to become,
- I will become that.

- I want you to be that!

It's over, okay?
Jess, we can't end an argument negatively.
What, is she...

- What do you want me to say?

It's like quantum physics, right?

- Yeah?

I don't get it on the most just basic and most surface of levels.
What I'm saying is that it's all the same thing.
Science and religion and all of that, it's all the same.

Science is trying to photograph it, and people go to church to try to feel it.
Honestly, I'm trying to pretend that I understand what you're talking about, but in high school, I thought the blue part of the globe was the sky, so I'm not deep.

I know that it's hard to not have anything to believe in,
- but it's easier if you try.

I...

I've probably done a lot worse than you.
Oh, come on.

What did you do?
That's not a first-time-we-meet conversation.
Well, maybe it's a second-time-we-meet conversation.
Well, you know, I...

- I'll give it a shot.

- You believe me?

That's where girls go wrong.
- Come on.

Wasn't that lovely?
You'll notice there are no babies being baptized today, that's it's not just for water safety.
It's because we practice a believer's baptism.
And unlike, say, the Catholics, who are sprinkling babies all Willy-nilly we have a three-week course.
So, Glen.
You need to leave Jess alone.
Do not interfere in our destiny, Peter.
Do you pledge your life to the service and love of Christ?
I do.
Welcome home, brother.
Oh yeah!
Praise Jesus!
Yee-haw-yoo!
We all need forgiveness.

We all need to come home, right?
That's what this is about.
All of us stray from the path sometimes.
Your wife tried to Shania Twain me, by the way.
What does that mean?
It means she tried to fuck me.
Just like the church, we represent God, welcoming you home.
Sure, you've made some mistakes, you've done some things you're not proud of, you made some choices that you regret.
Church is still here.
God forgives you.

Isn't that good news?
- Ellen.

- You ready to come home?

- Wait what?

- I need this!

- Jessica, this is not okay.

- Jessica, come on!

- Jessica, what are you doing?

- Please.

These people took a three-week course.
Monday and Tuesday, 9:00 to 4:00.
But you know I know all the basics.

- You've already been baptized.

Okay, Jessica, I don't think that you are in the right place for this, personally.
- Get her outta there!

- You shut up!

Jessica, we are all aware in this congregation that you've been unfaithful to Pete.
You cheated on him with an art teacher.
- Jess!

That's bullshit!
Baby, you don't need God.

- Sir.

This is very inappropriate.

I can't.

I'm so sorry.

I get this, though.

Congratulations.

I need you, and I want us to just go home.
That's what I want.

You don't need God.

God is love, and together, we make God.
Let's go home and make some God.

Okay, none of that is true, and most of it didn't make any sense.
- How do you know, Officer?

- So am I.

Pastor of life.
I love you so much, Jess, and I want to be with you for the rest of my life.
I've known that since we met.
I've made too many mistakes.
- That's okay.

Uh, Jess!

I've made mistakes too.
Hold on.
- Sir, would you hold this, please?

Wait.

I forgive you.

Okay.

Jess, we've both strayed from the path, but I forgive you.
Please forgive me.

It's not about your forgiveness.
It's something I have to do for myself.
- I want to come back.

Jess and I are together now.

Help you?

- We're a family.

I don't have to be a comedian.

I can make you laugh.

You don't want to be with him, Jess.

We can put the genie back in the bottle.
- You can't put genies back in bottles!

- They're out being genies!

I chose Jesus!
Oh!
Woo!
Hallelujah!
Oh!

That did not count.

Jess, you don't understand.

I have...

I...

I need to be with you.
God will provide a way, Peter.
He always does.
What about Tampa, though?
Jess?
I already put down a deposit!
Jess!

She wasn't that great.
- See?

Oh, that's good stuff.

I've been doing a lot of reflecting lately on the happiest moments of my life, and I thought of a big one.
You ever make plans with someone you do not want to hang out with and then they cancel?
Does wet money work, man?
What a rip.
It's not enough, anyway.

He's a bitcoin guy.
Do you ever think about who existed in your environment before you came upon it?
Like, for example, we are here, but... who was here before... we got here?

Maybe the Indians?
Maybe... pioneers?
Could be Vikings.
There were no Vikings... in upstate New York.
Are you still mad?
Don't eat French fries with your foot.
I'm really excited about our friendship, man.
We're not friends.

That's how it starts.
Would you be uncomfortable if I put on some adult fare?
