Vincent:

Streets are packed with tourists.
headed out on the vampire walking tour of New Orleans.
They think it's just a myth.
Just part of our city's charm.
we know better.
Just like we know...

This week marks five years since the fall of the mikaelsons.
Five years of peace.
And we paid a high price for that peace.
We witches...
We earned that peace. we severed our link with our ancestors.
(Chanting in foreign language) we backed Marcel Gerard.
(Groaning) we fought hard to build this community. that community will be challenged...
Because every year we get visitors.
(Jazz band plays "when the saints go marching in")
Vampires.
Vampires from all over the world... and they want to see firsthand the suffering of Klaus mikaelson.
Now some of those vampires...

Others...
Not so much.
out-of-town vampires...
They don't care about our city.
They don't follow our rules.
They will instigate trouble.
They will attempt to upset our peace.
And the only way that we're gonna get through that is if we get through that together.
this ain't the first time that we faced conflict.
Each and every single one of us here has faced their fair share of monsters.
I feel sometimes the city just has evil lurking in the shadows.
we've managed to keep our monsters buried.
And now we've got to make sure that they stay buried.
we will lose everything that we've built.
We will lose it...
Forever.
("When the saints go marching in" continues)
(Water dripping)
To five years of independence.
And old enemies who became new friends.
I thought you said this was strictly a business meeting.
you didn't mind last time we mixed business with pleasure. and I have quite a bit to share.
Klaus' enemies are flocking to New Orleans to celebrate.
some are seeking allies among your witches.
No doubt they want to befriend and perhaps steal your prize trophy.
Klaus himself.
Oh.

It's a good thing I called a truce with the witches.
Vincent wants peace as much as I do.
but
I'm hearing that the covens are up to something.
secret midnight meetings. or maybe he's planning a power grab.
I will ask him myself.
because you have bigger problems.

but there are others who will stop at nothing to find her.
Alistair duquesne for one.
He and his allies believe Hayley is the key to finding the rest of the mikaelsons.
So alistair's going after Hayley?
Alistair is here. which he will then use to track Klaus' siblings.
Or his child.
No one has seen or heard from the mikaelsons in half a decade.
Alistair's hunted down members of the strix.
He offers them as proof:
so is Elijah.
Which leads people to wonder if Hayley is somehow trying to bring the mikaelsons back.
(Birds singing)
(Lid creaks open)
(Vehicle approaching)
Is that her?
Let me check.
Stay inside. aren't you a sight?
You're sure no one followed you?
I've been avoiding trouble since well before you were born.
where's that little girl?
Did you find it?
please.
I am this close to getting them back.

So you're really gonna do it?
Cure 'em and then wake 'em up?
hope might be better off without 'em?
I made a promise.
To who?

To my daughter.
I promised her a home where she would feel safe and protected by the people that love her.
(Sighs)
Mary... too.
She's inherited all of their enemies and a power that...

She needs someone to teach her to control it.
I can't do this on my own.
You told me to wake the mikaelsons you needed to find all seven werewolf packs.
You found six.
The last one... the malraux...
I thought they'd been killed off. there might be one left.
Hayley.

You found nothing.
I get word of a lead.
too?
What if it's a trap?

Appreciate you coming.

it'd be a lot easier if i knew the witches were in check. provided you keep the vampires out. sigils scribbled on the walls?
Sounds like someone's stirring up trouble.
these out-of-town vampires man. handle your community.
Keep them in the cauldron. get 'em to stop.

Marcellus?
No.

I think we're overdue.
Not much to say?
And here I thought you'd enjoy the company.
What I would most enjoy...
Is for you to rot in hell.
there's two ways this can go.
easy way...
Or the other way.
once I figured i pulled this out.
And on that day you said a word that I've never heard you say.
Mercy.
Why not just kill me?
Because I'm not like you.
I'm stronger than you. and the city that you like to say you built... it's mine.
Did you come here seeking my approval?
I came for a little information.
an old friend of yours just arrived into town.
Alistair duquesne.
Word is... might even cause me some trouble.
I could kill him.
But who knows what kind of war that might start.
I would rather convince him to get into line.
You're gonna tell me how.
how do you want this to go?
(Grunts)
Pride was always alistair's weakness. throwing feasts in his own honor.
Just show him more of the same.
You'll find him quite malleable.
Do you have to go?
I do.
very soon.
And I won't be alone.
okay? you listen to Mary.

Deal.
(Sighs)
Keep your guard up.

What you need to do is stay alive for your little girl.
Everything I do is for her.

Whoa.

I know.

Whoa.
Adam.
Say you're sorry.

Sorry.
It's okay.
let me help you with that.
He doesn't listen.
Maybe I should stick him in a boundary spell.
He'll grow out of it.

That's optimistic.

For all of this.

Um... but she's into you.

I'm definitely gonna make a mess so if you want to help with that...
Come by for dinner tonight.

Niklaus turned me including my wife and my child.
All so that I could serve as a distraction to lure away his vile father.
I spent a century hiding in the shadows.
Where is my justice?
Hmm?
you made him suffer.
And you tell us and yet we have no proof.
And now the only thing that prevents him from returning to wreak untold havoc is your word.
I have him right where I want him.
He's not going anywhere.
Then I want to see his suffering with my own eyes.
And perhaps procure just a drop of his blood.
If only to test a theory.
we've known for some time that Elijah mikaelson somehow still lives.
My witch advisors suggest that his life immortal force.
I believe that to be Klaus himself.
that's an interesting theory.
Klaus' blood will allow us to confirm that link.
if true... surely that would be cause to kill him and eradicate his abominable family as well. it will ease the minds of all of your brethren. it will prove you to be a sympathizer.
I don't know about a sympathizer.
But I do know that I don't take ultimatums.
it's bad form to deny your guests.
It could sour their mood. awful shame if I or any of my followers were to go into your city with a soured mood.

Do not do that again.

You're the last of your pack.

I don't care about your problems.

Because there are others who know how important you are.
And they will come for you.

they're gonna have to kill me.
(Glass shatters in distance) Man (In distance):

I'm sorry.
We don't have time for this.
(Grunts) opens)
Marcellus.
Can I assume your soiree for alistair was a raging success?
Alistair doesn't give a damn about having his ego stroked. so he could throw down a challenge.
Or is that what you intended?
How difficult to be king.
An outsider has the gall to question your rule and you have no one to offer counsel.
You think I don't know.
The day after I bit Elijah he should have died.
But his sire line is still out there.
So I had Vincent cast a spell to figure out how that could be.
It turns out the lines of your siblings are anchored to you. but I'm not gonna let anything happen to Rebekah.
my sister still holds your fancy.
You may have no choice but to kill poor alistair.
et cetera.
his theory gains traction.
The vampires turn against me.

Even hope. right?
Marcel.
You don't know alistair.
you need me.
(Scoffs)
You're offering me a deal?
One you cannot dismiss.
Alistair and his ilk loathed me because of my strength.
Now they loathe you. and I speak it fluently.
and I will lay waste to the lot of them.
(Train clacking in distance)
(Train horn blowing in distance)
(Panting)
Relax.

you'd be dead already.
we're on the run from vampires?
You have the same stink they do.
I'm special.

half-werewolf. you should show me some respect.
How do I know you weren't the one that led them to me?

They know who you are and they want you dead.
The only way to survive is to do exactly what I tell you.
It's not like I have a choice. but I am not that kind of girl.
This is a device to extract your venom. it will hurt.
Why are you doing this to me?
I'm trying to save my family. the people in there are dying.
The only thing keeping them alive and the only one that can cure them is her.
and she left me instructions on how to wake her up early.
The only thing I'm missing is your venom.
i can give her the ingredients I got. no one has to die.
So if I give you what you want...
Will you let me go?
You have my word.
Appreciate you coming on short notice. i-i kind of got someplace I got to be.
I got to ask you to put 'em aside.
Tonight I need you here.

I will.
Marcel?
You about to start a war?

i won't have to lift a finger.
All I need from you is a boundary spell. no one can leave.
And it's got to be strong.
how strong?
Original strength.
You got my venom.

As soon as I know it works.
And when will that be? you'll know when you see it.
right?
How do you do that?
you ask a lot of questions.
(Grunts)
(Gasping)
Freya.
Are you okay?
Did you get the ingredients?
I need to begin.
If I can't turn all that into a cure... (Panting) Elijah and kol are going to die.
(Grunting)
How much longer do we have?
Maybe an hour.
Assuming they live that long.
Do you have everything we need? along with Klaus' blood.
Infused by my magic and magnified by the dark objects.
It's going to take all of my strength but...
It should be enough to fashion a cure to save my brothers.
Should"?

(Vehicles approaching)
We got company.
please.
they're gonna kill me.
They must have been tracking her.
I need more time.
(Gate creaks open)
(Indistinct chatter)
These guys are sketchy.
Stay close.

I'm gonna use you as a shield. alistair is in a mood.
He has his men positioned all over town awaiting his signal.
Marcel.
I had hoped your decision to meet in this... ruin had meant you'd come to your senses.
And yet I don't see Klaus' head upon a spike.
Apologies.
I have been a discourteous host.
(Murmuring) you got him.
(Groans)
(Panting) (Chuckles)
Niklaus.
How the mighty have fallen.
Marcel:

Chained.
Beaten.

I should just kill him. one cannot be free if one's oppressors continue to live. the best way to end your fear now laced with my venom.
One slice will draw Klaus' blood agonizing death that he deserves.
It would be...
My highest honor.
(Grunts)
(Groaning)
(Footsteps approaching) but we finally caught you.
Or maybe I just stopped running.
(Grunting)
(Pants)
(Groaning) as my wife suffered?
As my child suffered?
you do.
your suffering is at an end.
Crowd:

Do you hear that?
The people have spoken. but you deserve no such privilege.
I want the last words you ever hear to be my solemn vow.
I will find your daughter.
I will eradicate your malignant bloodline from... this... earth.

(Grunting)
(Shouting)
(Snarls) panting) (Grunts) growling)
(Shouting) who's next?

come on.
Meet... your... maker.
(Crack)
Marcel:

That is a nasty bite.
we have the cure.
keeping Klaus alive does come in handy. in case the wolves get out of line. in case his family comes back.
because I can. and I am the only one that can stop him from coming after all of you.
New Orleans is mine.
But you are all welcome to visit.
Enjoy yourselves.
But you follow my rules.
You behave. ever question me.
Does anybody have a problem with that?
All right then.
let's go celebrate.
