Previously on Beyond...
You swear on the sacred holy covenant of brotherhood?
I swear on the holy sacred covenant of brotherhood.
I connected to this machine.
I can feel it.
No!
No!

I had you!
And then you were gone.
You're not making any sense.

It's just complicated.
Let me know when you UN-complicate it.
Ow!

- At last.

I could hardly wait to meet you.
Cool logo.

Congregations need somewhere to congregate.
Don't make a move until I figure out just what the hell we're walking into.
Whatever it is you're going through, we go through it together.
It's a lot to explain.
Right now, we need to get Willa and get out.
You want to reach the Ocean of Light?
Let Holden go, and I'll take you.
I saw the most beautiful light.
There was a bridge.
26 years ago, I lost the only woman I ever loved.
She's in there, waiting for me on the other side of the bridge.
What greater motivation than love?
Are we ready?
Let's go.
Don't give up in there.
I'm coming, just stay strong.
There's no reason to be nervous.
There's every reason to be nervous.
This machine is untested.
Our entire foundation is built upon him being able to cross this bridge.
What if he can't?

I'll be fine.
And Hollow Sky?
Our investors are getting anxious.
Everyone who has walked through those gates did so because they believed.
I need you to believe too.
By the end of today, we'll have an answer to life's greatest mystery.
Tomorrow, we share it with the world.
Prometheus shared fire with the world... and a bird ate his liver for all of eternity.
When they write the book detailing our achievement here today, maybe don't mention that.
She gave you that, didn't she?
Belonged to her mother before Willa was even born.
How do you know that?
Because she's my daughter.
So you see, I've got just as much at stake as you do.
You and Arthur, you don't care who you hurt.
I actually care about Willa.
This is a pretty significant moment, so...
I hope you'll understand if my precautions lean a bit towards the severe...
What precautions?
Well... let's say for argument's sake, we get into this Realm and you decide you'd rather not lead me to the Ocean of Lights.
You can be quite destructive when you want to be.
Our vitals... yours, Willa's, and of course mine...
Will be monitored at all times to ensure you don't overreact.
Your brother is a very welcome insurance policy, if God forbid something should to happen to me once we set out on our journey.
Let's get this over with.
What happened?
Where are we?
You dropped us into the middle of the tundra.
Amazing!
Where's Willa?
I don't know!

She should be here.
I've never seen anything like this.
You sent your own daughter into uncharted territory!
You opened the door and shoved her through with no idea what's on the other side.
You're not a scientist, you're a sociopath!
What we're doing here is greater than me, you, or Willa.
- It's progress.

But you do care about her!
And you care about your brother.
Two very good reasons to stay on task.
So, let's go!
You know where you're going?
Ah!

The more you think about it, the worse it's gonna be.
Just close your eyes.
Count to three.
And stick the lightening rod into the scary thing with the electricity.
It's no big deal.
It's no big deal.
It's no big deal.
Okay.
It's just...
Just like Benjamin Franklin.
It's just gonna be a small, small little shock.
That's all it's gonna be, just a tiny, completely unnoticeable...
Son of a bitch!
Oh!

Got a fire alarm on the second floor.

Uh... um...
Uh... pfft.
Uh...

Phew!

Uh...
Uh...
We are already up and running.
It's a complete systems test.
Dr. Frost wanted to personally oversee it before you...
When can I see it?
Well, that's dependent on the next several hours.
No, Ms. Shoemacher, it's Hollow Sky who is dependent on us with our more than generous contributions.
Yes, and believe me, we're very grateful.
I expect that will change when we pull your funding.
If it's results you're after, we'll have them very soon.
End of business day, or we pull the plug on Frost and sell his life's work piece by piece.
You?
Hello, Luke.
Just can't seem to help running into one another.
The coffee shop.
Wasn't just a coincidence, was it?
Yeah, go to hell.
I think you're forgetting that you're our prisoner, Luke.
Yeah?

Stab me with your heels.
Oh, no.

That's what the men with guns are for.
- Kudos on the escape attempt, though.

My question to you still stands.
You're a smart kid.
I really think you have a lot of potential.
Whatever it is you're selling, I'm not interested.
Then what are you interested in?
I want you to take me to my brother.
Follow me.
Hey.
Why'd you tell me those things about Ian?
Wanna come in?
Okay.
The other night, you accused Ian and Hollow Sk...
Tom, what are you...
What are you trying to prove?
I'm not trying to prove anything.
I'm trying to protect you, the boys.
Have you heard from Holden?
He called yesterday.
He said he'd be back later on this afternoon.
I'll support you.
Okay?
If you think that Ian and this Hollow Sky could be dangerous, I will go with you to the police, stand next to you while you tell them everything.
But that's as far as we go.
Incredible.
What is this place?
We're in a temple.
They're safe havens.
Ah!
Willa, stop!

Ah!
Holden, what are you doing here?
What's he doing here?
You know full well what he's capable of.
Only he can take us across the bridge and only he can bring us back.
You're a snake!

- You can't!

They have my brother!
They have Luke.
If anything happens to Frost...
That's right.

Shall we?
What are you doing to him?
What the hell is that thing?
Hollow Sky's crowning achievement.
A machine that induces a coma-like state allowing...
Induces?
Wait, you put him back into a coma?
I know.

You have no idea.
No.

You don't know the first thing about your own brother.
The things he's capable of.
Yeah, well, why is everyone treating him like he's... he's some kind of "chosen one."
Because he is.
At least, that's what people will believe.
Oh, my god.
You're all crazy!
I'm not crazy.

We created a product to help the world feel better.
Supply-side economics, and we're the supplier.
People will line up all over the planet to get their taste.
So that's all this is?
What?

I may not believe in heaven... but I do believe in money.
What were you thinking, coming back here?
I was thinking of you.
I was trying to protect you.
I thought you'd understand.
Well, you're giving me way too much credit.
So it would seem.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, for starters, you destroyed the machine.
Then you disappeared for days only to wind up getting captured.
I thought I could appeal to him.
Why, because he's your father?
When were you gonna tell me that?
I wasn't.
I guess it doesn't matter now.

We give him what he wants.
We give up?

No, not Frost.

From the very beginning,
Arthur's been trying to prevent humankind from reaching too far.
All of the training has been for this.
To ensure life and death remain separate.
But if he crosses that bridge...
He won't!
And why not?
Because I'm gonna destroy it.
Sheriff, we know that this may be a long shot.
It's more than that, Diane.
We wouldn't be here if we thought this was some harmless charity nut paying their taxes.
This is about the safety of our family.
You know the attention Holden's been getting, and we've all been under a microscope for the past few weeks.
I know, it hasn't been easy.
No, Sheriff, you don't know.
And you won't until you start taking us more seriously.
Our son's friend was murdered.
Now, I...

Hollow Sky was directly responsible, but there's gotta be a connection, right?
And there...
There's gotta be something that we're not seeing.
I wish I could help.
But with no evidence of intimidation, no harassment, it's gonna be tough to build a case.
We're not looking to build a case.
We're just trying to protect our son.
And why would they be after Holden?
I don't know.
If you want this to be taken seriously, you have to give us something more than a handful of conspiracy theories courtesy of Jeff McArdle.
Pastor Ian.
He and I have been spending time together outside of church.
This morning, when I asked him about Hollow Sky,
I saw something in him I...

Something that scared me.
And do we have concrete evidence of misconduct?

But I do know how I felt.
I'm not making you promises.
I'll see what I can do.
All right.
"How wonderful that we've met with a paradox.
Now we have a hope for progress."
You said that to me once, and it's always stuck with me.
Those aren't my words.
They belong to Niels Bohr.
I discovered that later.
This machine...

But with all due respect, you were wrong.
Your mistake was your reliance on others to make this machine work.
But they can't do what you can do.
Not Frost, not Willa.
Hell, not even Holden.
Fix this.
Claim your immortality.
We're here.
The deepest part of the realm.
The Ocean of Light.
The edge of human existence.
Wait.
Where's the bridge?
There's no bridge!
This can't be the place.
Celeste, she was...
She was on the bridge.
She said she'd wait for us on the other side.
We've gotta get across.
You have to get me across.
Across to where?
Look, there's nothing on the other side.
There is!

We just can't see it yet.
You!
You can reveal it to us.
You were meant to show us the way.
I don't know how.
Yes, you do.
You know what to do.
And now, I need you to do it.
Your brother needs you to do it.
Beyond that light...
Celeste is waiting for me.
She's waiting for us.
Take us into the light... or your loved ones join mine in the hereafter.
You can do it.
Can I help you?
There's nothing you can do.
Wh... what's happening to him?
Oh!

Please, help him wake up.
Only Holden can do that now.
It's killing him!
Death is just the beginning.
Holden!

Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

Yeah.
May God show mercy to the righteous.
Look.

Who is that?
He was right.
I can't believe it.
Mom.
All this time...
I knew we'd be together again.
Wait!
- Mom.

It's not her.
It's not your mother.
Why isn't he backing off?
He's seeing what he wants to see.
It's blinding him to reality.
Celeste.
This isn't reality.
No.
Now what?
Blow up the bridge.
Do it.

Holden!
Don't!
Hey.
No!
I can't.
What?
Why?
Because...

When I blow up the bridge... you die.
What do you mean?
I had you in my hands... and I lost you.
I thought it was a memory, but it wasn't.
It just didn't happen yet.
- Holden, we're running out of time.
I watched you fall.
We can't let those things cross over.
I can't lose you.
This is what you meant to do.
I believe in you.
I'm not letting you go.
I won't let go.
Pull the plug!
Holden?
Come on, Holden, wake up.
Come on.

Holden.
You have to come back.
Please?
For me.
So you have to come back.
We've got so much more ahead of us.
What happened?
Hey.

Come on, let's go.
Send security down here immediately.
Jeff.
Nice and slow.
Jeff McArdle?
Tess Shoemacher.
You murdered my brother.
Jeff.

We gotta go.
Where's your car?
What, you didn't bring you car?
Yeah, Matthews, the valet's bringing it around right now.
No, I didn't bring my car.
You and Switchblade Sally ditched it at the front gate.
God, I love that car.
So how are we getting out of here?
Don't worry, I improvised.
Four suspects, three male, one female.
They're in a black utility vehicle.
Secure the perimeter, no one in or out until they're caught.
I repeat...
- Are we close?

There's only two roads that will take you off of this property.
And you're sure we're on the right one?
They seem to think so.
All right, hold on to something.

No!
Keep going.
Keep going?

Trust me.
Didn't you get your license, like, yesterday?
Jeff!
Oh!
Guess that really is lucky.
That compass didn't save us.
It belonged to your mother.
Frost told me before we went in.
You should have it.
You keep it.
So I know it's always safe.
I don't know how I can go back in there.
After everything that's happened, I... dunno if I can keep lying to them.
You have to.
We have to lie to keep them safe.
I know, it's hard.
But it's the only way.
You won't be alone.
You won't ever be alone.
See you soon.
I owe you big.
Thank you.
You don't have to thank me, Matthews.
- I just do what...

I know.
So...
I've got some questions.
I'm not sure how much Willa's told you or what you think you saw back there.
Just know, I'm still your brother.
Still me, that hasn't changed.
Are you kidding me?
Everything's changed.
Before we go in and pretend like everything's normal... there is one thing I really do need to know.
Are we safe?
I don't... know.
But...
I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure.
Me too.
I swear.
By the holy sacred covenant of brotherhood.
Get out of here.
Oh, man.
So, you know what you're gonna say?
Just like we talked about?
Okay, you may be able to flip cars in the air, but...

That's my superpower.
Hello?

- Well, it's about time.

I was about to send out a search party.
What the hell happened?
Well, we were coming home and the two front tires blew.
The whole truck spun off the road and into this ravine.
Ravine?

Except I missed the exit.
Help.

Help me.
Holden.

Charlie Singer?
You got a sec?
Still rocking that jacket?
All you need now is a big yellow hat and a monkey.
So, how is Anabelle?
Gotta be what?

She's fifteen.
And she's an ungrateful, hormonal brat.
Fifteen's a tough age.
You were no different.
What do you want?
Well, you ran away before I could say a proper goodbye.
Yeah, you shot at me.
And?
How is the boy wonder?

That's sort of why I'm here.
I... want to help you.
And him.
Unless that's a prescription for some groovy painkillers...
Arthur's location.
Hm-mm!
I need something from you first.
What happened?
You did this.
What did you think would happen when you blew that bridge?
This world was the first to change.
Yours will be the next.
You have to fix this.
How?
