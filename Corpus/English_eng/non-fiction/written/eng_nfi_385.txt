Linus:

I need to appoint someone to take all my responsibilities.
Please tell me I didn't lose a potentially career-changing promotion just so you could date the new brunette?
We are not okay.
Wait, you're handling this stitch?
He's got the yips.

And that is why we need to keep your mother safe, so that after stitching technology is perfected we can stitch into her living evolved brain and map it completely.
- Good talk.

Woman:

Things are heating up.
The more physically intimate you guys are, the more it's going to mess with your ability to stitch.
We have to do this if we're gonna save my mother.
Oh, I know.

- How are those oxytocin levels?

(chuckles)
Never lower.
(machine trilling, beeping)
(lock clicks)
Camille:

- What?

There's no walk.

I gotta say, I give you and Cameron a lot of credit for holding out as long as you did before finally throwing oxytocin to the wind in favor of the other big (moans) "O."
We didn't.

We're keeping things very PG around here.
- And your night?

Hard "R."
Cameron's really able to keep his hands off you?
He's got incredible willpower.
He's fine.
- (grunting) - 98.
99, 100.
Yo, bro, how long you gonna keep this up for?
As long as it takes for you to work up a damn oxytocin filter.
- Feet.

Look how much money you're gonna save on your gas bills with all those cold showers you take.
Oh, cold showers aren't a thing.
And money, I have.
What I don't have is a functioning oxytocin filter.
- Can we talk about your yips for a moment?

Look, I get it, you're freaked out about Kirsten.
- Not talking about it.

And that fear has manifested itself into yips.
- Still not talking about it.

I agree with you.
You should let Camille pilot stitches for a while.
- I'm a good listener if you ever need one.

Thanks, but I'm good.
For now, I'll do me, you do the filter.
You got it, boss.
So define "a cuddle." Was there spooning?
Instead of you asking me inappropriate questions and me avoiding them, can I interest you in a little trouble?
Go on.
To save my mother, we need to perfect stitching, right?
Go on!
And to perfect stitching, we need to fully map the human brain, right?
And now that Cameron has me piloting the stitches...
Then we can spend a little more time in the regions that we need to map.
- Okay, except that we don't...

I hacked into the lab's mind map system.
Our progress, mapping the brain.
Pulsing sections are everything we've already treaded.
And the static areas are regions that we haven't fully mapped yet.
They'll be our focus moving forward.
Okay, so, just to be clear, you want me to go behind the back of and flip a hearty bird to my employer, the National Security Agency?
- Absolutely.

- Cameron doesn't know you want to do this?

He's obsessed with my safety, and lingering anywhere long enough to map it would just completely freak him out.
And also, you don't go to your boss when you want to break protocol.
You come to someone like me.
Now what we need is a body.
(dramatic music playing)
(screams)
(theme music playing)
♪ Take me inside ♪
♪ Take me inside ♪
Vic's a John Doe, mid-to-late 30s.
Shot once in the chest before being thrown or falling off the roof of the Windwood Hotel.
Tattoo on his right forearm is running through image recognition now.
Killer also shot off his left index finger.
That reminds me, we're out of baby carrots.
Finger's missing.
However, terracotta shards were in the wound.
So we dug out the bullet from a tile in the roof where we know his hand was held down.
We're running ballistics on it now.
Why shoot off his finger?
Maybe the killer was trying to make a point.
No pun intended.
Maybe I should pilot this.
Both:

You might still have a little performance anxiety.
(stutters) She means in a stitch kind of way.
Of course.
It's the only frame of reference I have on you.
You can try naming all the state capitals.
- I hear that helps.

Whatever.
You can pilot.
Here's my map.
This must be what Beyonce feels like when she drops a secret album.
After you upload it, watch out for Linus.
He'll be the first one to notice something's up.
You know, you could always think of the starting lineup for the '69 Mets.
I don't know...

I am.
Lights to 20%, please.
I need a go, no-go for stitch neurosync.

Go.
- Sub-Bio?

- Engineering?

You can also think of all the different kinds of pickles.
Works for me.
- Communications?

- Medical?

- Com check.

All right.

- "I see dead people."

Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.
In three, two, one... mark.
This is odd.
Describe "odd."
I'm in a gallery of some kind, but it's deserted.

- And I'm sensing something.

What are you sensing?
I'm sensing that it's not a real art gallery.
I can't explain it.

- Does she need to bounce?

No.

Linus, where is she?
Part of the brain responsible for symbols and imagery.
It's an area we haven't mapped fully.
- Might explain what she's feeling.

- No, let her poke around.

My stitch, my rules.
My lab, my orders.

Got a memory hotspot in another region that's mapped a little better.
- Move her.

Isolate memory image and grab what you can, thanks.
Did I make a mistake trusting you?
No, sir.

No, wait, I see something.
It's like a dollhouse scene, but on a display stand.
(cellphone chimes)
Just got a hit on John Doe's tattoo.

He's a sailor?
Apparently who plays with dolls.
There are weird things.
There's a swan and a sword.
And a patch of grass.
- (soldiers march)

There's four toy soldiers marching underneath it, around a golden snake.
Any of you geniuses know what any of this means?
(sighs) Sorry, I don't speak bizarro.
There's a tile on another pedestal.

And there's another golden snake wrapped around the cow.

This is the kinda dream I have after, like, three tequilas.
John Doe encrypted his memories.

Move her to the language processing cortex.
I kinda feel like there's more to explore here.
Mission clock at two minutes and forty-three seconds.
There's no time.

We need to be in the language processing cortex.
- Cameron, I just think...

- This stitch is over.

- Death moment approaching.

(hissing)
(machine powers down)
You okay?
- I'm fine.

- Nothing.

Oh, I don't like your tone, Goodkin.
You kept Kirsten in an unmapped area for longer than I wanted to, so are you reckless or stupid?
Well, that depends.

Neither.

Okay, guys, let's just dial the temperature down here.
It's my fault.

It'll prepare us better to stitch into my mother.
Did you at least see who killed John Doe?
Yeah.

I'll tell you what it means.
It means John Doe built a mind palace, a memory technique for people who need to keep their secrets secret.
- Royal Marines plus mind palace equals...

More gold.
More like gold-gold.
- That's it.

- Kirsten:

A harmless snake encouraged by farmers to live in barns.
John Doe's snake was far from harmless.
- What about the soldiers?

- Cameron, where you going?

I'm going rogue.

While you're gone, I'll follow up with Fisher on ballistics.
And we can check out the crime scene, uh, see if there's anything there that ties into the images.
(bored) Yay, a field trip.
I'll go with you.
I could apologize again if it would make you happy.
Look, you know I've accepted prioritizing your mother over us, but then you go behind my back and make this secret plan for the stitch with Camille instead of coming to me?
You would have said no.
What part of, "I need you to trust me," did you not understand?
Is this what it is to care about someone?
That you're worried about them all the time?
Because, Cameron, that just doesn't sound right to me.
I have a history of watching people I care about get into bad situations or worse.
Well...
- Then maybe we shouldn't be together.

No.

You are not the only one who gets to worry about how the other person is doing.
Fine.
I'll work on not being such a helicopter boyfriend.
That's the last time you go rogue.
At least, not without me.
Okay.

I'll be Rogue One and you can be Rogue Two.
Oh, there will never be a Rogue Two.
Agent Goodkin, I'll tell you the same thing I told you over the phone.
MI6 has nothing to tell the NSA.
So, none of your people are in Los Angeles right now?
- I didn't say that.

We think he's one of yours.
- Do you have a name?

I assure you, Agent Goodkin, there's no connection between your John Doe and MI6.
He has a Royal Marines tattoo.
And we have reason to believe he was familiar with spycraft.
If this man was a member of the Royal Marines,
I honor and respect his memory... but that still doesn't make him MI6.
What I don't respect is the NSA.
Always barging in where they're not welcome, wanting cooperation, but never offering any in return.
You see, I've dealt with your organization in the past.
Don't care for it.
And see no reason to do it again.
So, what is it you want, hmm?

Consider it a professional courtesy.

What I want, you don't have the authority to grant.
Try me.
Help me help you.
Why are you quoting Jerry Maguire?
He does that.
So... what do you want?
Cameron:

LAPD picked her up last night on a drunk and disorderly.
A drunk MI6 agent?

So, any chance Stephanie can pull some strings at the DA's office?
We get her out, Agent Stick-Up-His-Ass helps us with our John Doe.
Why doesn't he go through official channels?
I dunno.

Uh-huh.
All right, let me see what I can do, but no promises.
Okay.
"Agent Stick-Up-His-Ass," huh?

Huh.

Our jobs are to put people in jail, not get them out.
- Why the sudden interest in Chloe Marks?

If Chloe's the "quid" who's the "quo"?
Classified, I get it.
- She punched a cop.

Tell that to the cop's busted nose.
Well...
Are you really going to make me do this without going through the proper channels?
We both know no one can make Stephanie Fisher do anything she doesn't want to do.
I'll file the paperwork.
Thank you.

Dinner?
(chuckles)
This favor goes way beyond dinner, my friend.
I can work with that.
She's so...
- Young.

Chloe Marks.
Which one of you is my savior?
Ah, it was a team effort.

We're with the NSA.

Well, it's about bloody time.
Never mind.
Get me a fluffy robe and all the little lavender amenities,
- and I'll forgive you both.

Yeah, about that.

The hotel booted me after my, I assure you, provoked, unfortunate conduct in their lounge.
- So where are you staying now?

Well, we can take you back to Abbott's office.
Please.

I don't mind the occasional "walk of shame"...
God knows I've done enough of them...
But this one could be a career ender.
Well, I'm not too far from here, if you want to come back to my place and clean up.
- You're a love.

Professional courtesy.
(mouthing)
Linus:

Apple tree.

Roots underground.

Snake and apple.

Is it a relationship gone wrong or a relationship gone right?
You're working too hard.
Pretty much the first time I've ever been accused of that.
Yeah.

It's a language.
That only our John Doe knew.
I should loop Ivy in on this.

Really?

You'd like her if you got to know her.
I'm sure she's lovely or something.
(sighs) Look, I know... things are "not okay," to use your words...
Good, you were paying attention.
But we gotta get past this.
Whether you like it or not, Ivy is important to me.
So, I'm sorry supporting her before didn't work out.
It bit me in the ass.
But that's not my fault.

Can't we please just move on?
Look, I'm seeing Ivy today after work.
Why don't you join us?

I, uh...

You have plans?

Oh.
Who is he?
All right.

I'm dating the medical examiner who works with the program.
- Amanda?

Hey.

Ugh!

Bring Ivy to the house for dinner tonight.
Amanda and I will cook.
- Are you sure?

And listen, nobody in the lab knows about Amanda.
And it's been pretty perfect, but it's also new and I don't want to make this an in-lab meme, so...
Oh, don't...

Lips are sealed.

Man:

(shower splashing)
Kirsten:

Well, we held up our end of the bargain, now MI6 has to hold up theirs.
We'll tell Abbot that we rescued his agent and hopefully he can find out who our John Doe is.
(faucet squeaks)
Okay.

- I figured you'd go.

- It is my loft.

Agent Goodkin... do you happen to have something I can wear while my clothes dry?
Things got a little messy last night, so I washed them in your sink.
Uh, Agent Clark can help you with that.

(door opens, closes)
Abbot:

He was a mid-level agent with us.
Forgive me, I had no idea how serious this was.
I assume Harrington was here on a case.
No, not recently.
A few months ago, yes.
Well, the NSA's gonna need to see the file for the case he was working on.
Sorry, it's been scrubbed.
All right, we need to cooperate with each other.
NSA is hard to cooperate with.
That case Harrington was on, he brought his wife, Belinda, with him as part of his cover.
She was unaware it was a business trip.
Then she was abducted, right from the hotel where she was going to meet John.
Kidnapped?
Ransom demands were made, payments dead-dropped.
She is presumed dead.

Harrington went balls-to-the-wall to find her killer.
I tried to reason with him, but he'd have none of it.
Went rogue, came back here on his own dime.
That's when I brought in Chloe...

How do you know Belinda isn't still alive?
Because the animal who took her shot off her index finger and mailed it to Harrington.
Are you and Agent Goodkin more than just professional acquaintances?
Agent Marks.

C'mon, Kirsten.

Hmm.

God, I wish.

Is that your mission?

You don't think much of me, do you?
That's okay, neither did my family.
I had a very privileged upbringing.
What's the old saying?

So when MI6 recruited me, I went for it.
- To rebel?

(cellphone chimes)
Cameron just texted.
Abbott said the agent's name was John Harrington and that you were looking for him in the days before he was killed.
Well, he was my first assignment.
Cocked that up good.
Please tell me you're close to finding his killer.
(cellphone chimes)
Ugh.

Talk of "stuffy."
He and Harrington used to be partners, did you know that?
Actually, no.
Hmm.

- Anyway...

- please let me know.

And if he accidentally says something interesting, I'll let you know.
So, Harrington's wife's name is Belinda.

We know that Old High German for "bright serpent" is Betlinde.
The golden snake is Belinda.
That's... possible.
But that would mean Harrington's death memory is of him being attacked by his dead wife, so...
Let's try this.
Harrington "cut" from MI6 to search for his wife.
- His wife's the swan?

(sighs)
Okay, new topic.
How long do you think it would take you to break a six-digit code on the credenza in Maggie's office?
Think whatever's inside that credenza might have something to do with how our cases get picked.
Maggie put me in charge, I need to know everything.
Just ask her.

Yeah, but then again, she might not.
Never ask a question you don't want to hear the answer to.
Hours to weeks.
Long as it gets done before Maggie gets back.
How goes twisted Pictionary?
- Oh.

Everyone go home.

We'll pick this up tomorrow, huh?
- I thought we were getting some rest.

- Okay, can I help...

You didn't let me finish.
Can I help you decide where we're gonna take-out from tonight?
So, I'm thinking tonight's Kubrick film should be Barry Lyndon, an Irish adventurer who was recruited to be a spy.
- Art imitating life?

Hope you don't mind.

(dramatic music playing)
It's lovely.

Are you okay to talk about what happened?
Abbott was miffed I lost Harrington...
- and got pinched by the cops.

Don't let Abbott's bearing fool you.

Used to brag about waterboarding detainees.
Well, something must've set him off.
I did ask him about his relationship with Harrington.
What'd he say?
Nothing.

You must've hit a nerve.
You think Abbott could've killed Harrington?
Pushed him off a roof?
No, he's far too clean.
Well, maybe Abbott wanted it to look like someone-not-as-clean did it.
It's not my problem anymore.

I mean, I did not sign up for... this.
So I quit.
Have an early morning flight back to London.

Then, you'll stay here until then.

You can have Cameron's room.

Both of you?
Together?
Cozy.
Babe, are you sure your friends are cool with mezcal?
I mean, not everyone's into the smoky taste.
Camille:

Ivy might be more of a wild card.
You are so...
Oh, my goddess, I can't even describe it.
- (knock on door) - (groaning)
- That's them.

Oh, hello and welcome.
- Hey, it's great to see you again.

- Amanda?

And this is a Mezcal Mule.
It's my grandma's recipe.

(laughter)
We brought wine.
For after, perfect.

Amanda and I will finish making dinner.
Yeah.
- Shiitake for a green pepper?

I'd offer you beer or wine, but Agent Marks cleaned me out pretty good.
Hmm.

Aah.

(cellphone rings)
Oh, it's Maggie.
"All of Harrington's files were scrubbed except the one he was working on here."
"That wasn't scrubbed, because it never existed."
- So Abbott lied to us?

It's called a mind palace.
Could the sum of the letters of cow be the answer?
See, it's not a code, it's a language.
Welcome to "Around Los Angeles in 80 Bites."
These are my favorite appetizers from my favorite restaurants.
Just please try my gnocchi before you decide who's Top Chef in this relationship.
- Ooh, wait.

Uh, Linus, you wanna be a dear and help Amanda?
Amanda:

I'm pretty sure I don't need any help.
It's on a high shelf.

- Tall-ish Linus to the rescue.

(clears throat)
Okay, listen.

Wow.

From someone who really cares about her.
- You mean, like me?

What do you mean, "what is my game?"
You heard me, sweetheart, I don't trust you.
And that's fine, because I don't really trust a lot of people, but if you hurt Linus in any way...
What makes you think I would hurt Linus?
Oh, I don't know, let me think.

I'm warning you, Camille may act tough, but... (laughs) Hold up.
Did you just say, "I'm warning you"?
Do you have any idea what I do for a living?
I know nine different ways to kill you and make it look like natural causes.
So why don't you get the frickin' crackers before I show you number eight?
I'm not my father.
I like Linus for who he is.
- There's no ulterior motives.

I'd say that qualifies as an ulterior motive.
Trixy-bits for everyone.
Yummy!
Quincy?

Good or bad?
I'm not sure yet.
I got a call from a friend of mine at the DOJ.
My name has come up in some meetings and there might be an opening there...
- for me.

- It probably won't happen.

That's what we thought about us.

This is great.
Yes.

(indistinct chatter)
Mm.

This is way better than sex.
- Mm.

But these days, I gotta take what I can get, right?
We need to get everyone to the lab.
- What's up?

I'll shoot a text to the team.
Well, what about Chloe?

- Well, she'll be fine until the morning.

If Abbott's involved, he'll be able to figure out my address.
This loft's in my name.
Oh, my house isn't.

Okay, wake her up.

Okay.
She sleeps naked.

- Camille?

Hey, wait.

- Charmed, I'm sure.

Cool if she stays here tonight?
Mmm.

Why not?
(chuckles) Because she's already got an overnight guest.
(Amanda chuckles sheepishly)
Of course she can stay.
(sighs) Amanda, meet Kirsten and Chloe.
Kirsten you know about.

Oh, very exciting.

- Oh, then you must know my family.

I like this one.
Why don't you guys run off and Chloe and I will swap horror stories.
We won't be long.
- Is there wine?

Take your time.
- We won't be too long.

- Camille...

I was going to say that I'm happy for you.
Amanda seems great.
Yeah.
Look at this.
- A cow.

A cow.
Uh-uh.

Correct.

Well, it's not a baby cow.
It's a miniature breed.

As in Dexter Abbott.
The cow on the mind palace was standing on a terracotta tile.
Dexter was on the roof of the hotel which has terracotta tiles.
So either Abbott was there when Harrington was killed, knows who killed him, or killed him himself?
Let's go with option number three.
Just got ballistics.

It is from Abbott's weapon.
Let Maggie know what we found.
Go to Abbott's apartment, see if he's there.

We'll go to the consulate and check his office.
Nice work, boss.
Elementary, my dear Fisher.
See.

(Kirsten gasps)
(gun clatters)
Okay.

Everything okay?
Um... your boss was attacked in his office.
He was shot.
Dexter?
Oh, my God.
Is he dead?
He lost a lot of blood and is heavily sedated.
- I should go see him.

Why?

Look, we're just gonna hunker down, drink some more vino... and it'll all be fine.
Hey, boss.
Prepare to kneel before me.
You worked up an oxytocin filter?
Yeah... funny story about that.

So why am I kneeling before Zod?
Once we knew that the cow represented Dexter and that the tile represented the roof of the hotel,
I was able to develop a codex.
We now have an interpretation protocol to help us unravel all of Harrington's mind palace images.
Very cool.
- You ready, boys?

Zod is always right.
All right, thanks to Dr. Ahluwalia we might have a filter that unravels Harrington's mind palace.
Lights to 20%, please.
I need a go, no-go for...
I'll, uh...

You sure?
Yeah.

so... (exhales) I'm working on that.
I'm good.
The inside of Kirsten's head is all yours, dude.
All right.

I need a go, no-go for stitch neurosync.

Go.
- Sub-Bio?

- Engineering?

- Excellent reference.

- Medical?

- Com check.

All right.

Memories are still encrypted.
Just gimme a moment.
Any chance we can mind map more of this region while we're here?
- Map what you can, as fast as you can.

- Okay.

I see a door.
It's open.

- More mind palace?

- Camille, how's the mapping?

It's all white because the memories are encrypted and the area isn't fully mapped.
Mapping takes time.

Let's move.
- Think of the end game.

I'm going through.
(birds chirping)
(instrumental music playing)
I'm at a wedding, and it's not encrypted.
Tell Zod, "Nice job."
Father:

- Cameron:

It's his wedding to Belinda.

I, John Harrington, take you...
There's apples, just like in Harrington's memory.
And a family crest.

Come to mama.
Okay.

Hello.

Hello and how do you do?

- Four marching soldiers.

(mutters) A beautiful snake.
(Belinda speaks, echoes) I take you, John Harrington, to be my husband.
Kirsten:

Cameron:

Kirsten:

Belinda and Abbott were having an affair, and Harrington must have found out about it.
Belinda: until death do us part.
That means that Belinda was on the roof with Abbott.
They killed Harrington together.
Pull up what you can on her.
Belinda: until death...

She wanted her family ring back.
It was probably stuck.

Okay, we're burning daylight.

You got eyes on bridezilla?
(dramatic music playing)
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Camille!

(beeping)
Belinda Lindsay is Chloe Marks, and she's in my house right now!
- Amanda:

- Chloe:

- Yes.

_
Oh, hey.

Chloe:

Uh, yeah, just finished work early.
Early?

- (Camille clears throat)

Thanks so much for letting me stay here.
Amanda are I are now good friends.
Oh.
Not too good, I hope. (nervous chuckle)
Is it hot outside?

It's a little... humid.
Um, Amanda, can I talk to you on the porch real quick?
Hey.
Are you sure Amanda doesn't want her phone?
(dramatic music playing)
Amanda, go. (grunts)
(both grunting)
(gagging)
(Chloe screams)
(police siren wailing)
Hope you're hungry.

I usually do this on dead people.
Yeah?

Umm... sexier than some.
- Aah!

Thanks for saving my life.
Man, when Chloe came at us with that knife,
I dunno, something snapped inside me.
I was just so afraid of losing you.
I don't let people in.

It's not who I... raised myself to be.
But I let you in.
It must be scary.
I'm so scared.
But I'm so excited.
My life makes sense with you in it.
Oh, you are pretty pleased with yourself, aren't you?
And why not?

A murderous MI6 agent who slept naked in my bed...
Don't push it, pal.
And her boss, both of whom are going to spend the rest of their lives in jail.
(laughs) Well, that's inter-agency cooperation.
Heh.

'Cause she was all about fun, and it was way more fun to seduce Abbott and get him to help her disappear, and kill her husband when her first plan crashed and burned.
- Poor guy.

He used the NSA to get her out of jail.
He used us, not the NSA.
"Ee-ther, eye-ther."
Poor Harrington.
All he had to do was forget about Belinda after she went missing.
Well, he couldn't.
He loved her.
(soft instrumental music playing)
Some part of him knew that nothing could keep them apart, not even her death.
- (sighs) - (laughs)
Thank you, though, for saving me in Abbott's office.
You're welcome.
- Cured my, uh...

- Yeah.

(chuckles)
- Oh, so the other day...

- I'm sitting here...

- Absolutely.

When I hear this buzzing sound...
- Mm-hmm.

And right after that, I got Harrington's stitch alert.
- Related?

I think there's a device in there that's connected to how our cases get picked.
- It's a six-digit unlock code.

Randomized.

(keys beep, device beeps)
- This will take forever.

Welcome to forever.
Linus.
If we can only find out where this gets its information from...
Well, then we can figure out where our cases come from, and we can pick the ones that will help us the most.
Remember how I said I'd help you save your mother?
Yes.
- I meant it.

Hmm.

- Oh, I'll let you keep your fingers.

(closing theme playing)
