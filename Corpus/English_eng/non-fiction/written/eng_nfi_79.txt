- I am never going to let you go.

- And experimented on.

Yes.
This is the place.

She is a Russian soldier.
You're telling me so many lies, Freya.
- Forgive me.

In the bay!

(MAN CHUCKLING)
(WIND GUSTING)
(HORROR MUSIC PLAYING)
The lock's been broken.
(TORCH CLICKS)
This place is supposed to be abandoned.
(DISTANT WHIRRING)
Sounds like a petrol engine.
Jesus.
Is that a head?
(MAN GROANS)
Oh, fuck!
You shouldn't have come.
AH!
(GROANING)
(GRUNTS)
I'm off to work now, darling.
I'll see you tonight.
Hi.
(CHUCKLES)
I should...

It's okay.

You know, for me, things are a bit complicated.
Yeah.
I have an unbelievable hangover.
Everyone has.
Do you trust me, Mr. Anderssen?
(SCOFFS) Of course I fucking don't.
Hypothesis.
You were infected by parasitic wasp larvae.

Or you trapped yourself.

And the last time anything like that happened was in 1942.
The wasp larvae carry a microscopic parasite into their host.
The host usually dies.
But if it doesn't, I believe the parasite can somehow alter its genetic code.
The host develops great physical resilience.
It's able to regenerate tissue and organs.
It can even pull bodies out of the Arctic water without noticing the cold.
My genetic code has changed?
I think it's possible.
I'm not human?
Of course you're human.

(BREATHING SHAKILY)
Another side effect of this genetic change is uncontrollable violence.
A monster!
I didn't say that.
A demon.
It's not your fault.

Somewhere safe.

Help me find a cure.

- Nobody can help me.

She was awake when you cut her open.
Don't leave town, Mr. Anderssen.
(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)
_
(HE SIGHS)
Do we know how it happened?
I had a look at, erm... erm... at Hildur...
It's okay.
She died in the water, before she could drown.
The cold would have shut down her organs.
She was unharmed, apart from some light bruising on her wrists.
That was me.
We had a fight.

I held her wrists.
You, erm... mustn't blame yourself.

We'll handle the formalities.
Lars Ulvinaune saw her walking in a daze towards the bay.
She was distressed.

Where she was found.
You're saying she killed herself?
(HE SIGHS)
Because I wouldn't listen.

And now she's dead.
(ERIC SIGHS)
Dead.
(CRASH)
Dead.
- (BANG)

(WHISPERING) Dead.
Dead.
(CRASH)
DEAD!

DEAD!

Eric.
Go get drunk.
That's an order.
(HE BREATHES HEAVILY)
(OBJECTS CLATTER)
We can take it from here.
I'm the governor.

I'm not sick.

It looks like suicide, Dan. (SIGHS)
Suicide?
She and Eric had separated.
They had a terrible fight.
Petter Hansen said they nearly killed each other.
And she was depressed because she was sacked for defending Fortitude.
Hildur was depressed.
Also she'd been drinking, in her room, and making wild allegations against the government.
I should've stopped her, I should've talked to her, but...
Where's her stuff?

You're not the Sheriff here!

There is a killer hiding somewhere here, there is a sick woman who... who'll die unless she gets help.
- We must focus our priorities.

(GRUNTS)
Okay, okay... you can help, on a consultancy basis, and you report directly to me.
Everyone reports to me.
- (DOOR CLOSES)

Who isn't?
What shall we do, Dan?
I told you.
Who was on duty when he cut out Tavra's tongue?
Me.

So how did he get into the cells?
We've had a lot on our plates.
It's not magic.

I know.

Who upgraded it, Ingrid?
Ketil Blakstvedt doesn't cut people's tongues out.
No.

We should have thought of that.
What about Elena?

I'm sure she's okay, Ingrid.
Oh.

The light is gone.
(PHONE RINGS)
Erling Munk.
I approached Dan Anderssen.
It's obvious he's not going to co-operate voluntarily.
We'll need some help.
The problem is Yelburton!

She knows nothing.

- I'll deal with her.

This is the biggest breakthrough since antibiotics, some reindeer vet with a grudge isn't going to blow it.

I didn't sign up for this.
You signed up for everything.
Vincent!
Can you gimme a hand?
Have you got room in your cold storage?
We found her out on the ice, she's stone dead.
Looks like she got shot.
What happened to her eyes?
You tell me?
We've got a trolley inside.
Dr. Khatri working today?
She's always at work.
(ELEVATOR BELL CHIMES)
(KNOCKING)
- Hey, Doctor.

I was...

What's your wife's diagnosis?

She's got Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
We're years from a cure, Mr. Lennox.

I know, but y... but you-you saw that film and you saw those wasps, they changed that guy.

On reflection, I think it's all a little far-fetched.
No, no, no, i-it's not, it's real!
I went to that place.
Where they operated on that guy, in, in the film.
I-It's the old weather station.

The-the-the table and the straps and it happened!
I'm sure it did.
You, you don't have to patronise me...

You could help my wife.
Please!
I'm sorry.
Hey.

Why are you lying to me?
Don't you just turn your back on me.
Hey!

You know something.

God damn you.

HEY!

(ANGRY SIGH)
(RUNE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
What?
Dad.

Mrs. Odegard.

(PHONE BUZZING)
Natalie Yelburton.
Governor.
Okay.

(PHONE RINGS)
Hildur's phone is ringing.

And it was here, right?

Yeah.

Maybe we should interview Vincent.
Vincent?

No.
But he's cute.
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)
(ENGINE STARTS)
(PHONE RINGS)
- Michael.

Did you hear?
How... how did it happen?
We don't know.

It seems like she just drowned.
Hildur did not "just drown"!
We're looking into it, okay?
I need to see you.

You idiot!
What's that?
These are mushrooms used to make muscimol.
So we can guess what's in these flasks.
I'll be taking care of this.
(SLURPING)
Mrs. Odegard came back from Oslo on the flight Tuesday morning.
She pulled up!
And I was here and I told her Tomak was dead and she asked if she could see Eric and I said "Not a good time" and she just went up anyway.
She came in here to talk to Eric, I listened from outside the door, but he... he cut her dead and then someone called her.
She had her phone.
Yes.

She must have left that in the car.
Do you think it was that Mulberry bag I really liked?
The dark brown one.
I preferred the little black one, the Yves Saint Laurent.
- The one Eric bought her in Paris?

Ah no, she hardly ever used it.
So who called her?
Michael?
Yes, he wanted to show the scientists that film.
I said to her, "Eric's under a lot of strain" and she said "I know."
And those were the last words she ever said to me.
(SNIFFS)
Eric.

I'm...

(CLEARS THROAT)
Eric, I-I've been, err, hearing rumours, people are talking about suicide... you don't believe that, do you?
What do you want?
Hildur, she didn't kill herself.
They should have made you Sheriff!
Eric.

Oh, no, Jesus fucking Christ... the fucking bullshit, fucking conspiracy.
- No it is not bullshit.

He never even got a parking fine in his whole fucking life.
Goddammit, Eric, Hildur overheard Munk talking on the phone.
She needed help.

Not some sad ex-boyfriend playing along to get back in her pants.
(SIGHS DEEPLY)
(SLURPING)
You know what, Eric?

You know what, Michael?

Maybe you wouldn't have lost your FUCKING BOAT.
Eric!
Eric!
(ENGINE STARTS)
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)
Hildur didn't kill herself!

She was silenced.
- Silenced?

Erling Munk's taking money, and that's why he fired Hildur, and that's why he promoted Eric.
And that's why she's dead.
Munk killed her?
Well, it's... it's not Munk, it's somebody Munk works for.
She had proof that he was corrupt.
All she needed was for Eric just to follow it up.
Where's this proof?
The last time I saw her, right over there, she said that she was onto something.

That Munk was controlling it, and someone was controlling Munk.
A few hours later, she was dead.
Munk said she was depressed.

Yeah, he would say that.

It doesn't make sense!

Nothing at all.
Only rock and snow and water.
Yeah, you're right...

Evidently, we're missing something.
Dr. Yelburton, thank you for coming.
(BREATHING RAPIDLY)
Are you alright?
- Err, Hildur was an old friend.

And I'm still shocked about Dr. Khatri, you know... what you told me.
Please.

I spoke to an official I trust at the Ministry.
He is taking this very seriously, he can go straight to the top of the W.H.O.
They are the main sponsors of Dr. Khatri's work here.
But he must see all the proof we have against her.
I'm still waiting for the results of the DNA comparison.
Have you told anyone else about your suspicions, anyone at all?
Not even Vincent Rattrey?
No, not even Vincent.

I'll scan everything and get them straight back to you.
(GENERAL CHATTER)
Ketil Blakstvedt.
I heard you died.
That's right.
A while ago you changed the security system in the police station.
If you say so.
- Did you do it on your own?

You're not still sore about that parking permit, are you, Ketil?
- (ALL CHUCKLE)

Good.

You're not even a cop anymore, Dan Anderssen.
I'm, err, doing some consultancy.
I still don't remember. (HE LAUGHS)
- (GRUNTS) Jesus, Dan.

He's an outsider.

AH!

The only lawyer in Fortitude is Hildur Odegard.
And she's currently unavailable.
You're afraid of him, aren't you?
He cut off the crazy guy's head!
What about Tavrani Tavra's tongue?

Vladek!

Where's he live?
I don't know... he stole my fucking generator... that's all I know.
I want a list of all the people he's worked for.
- Enough.

ENOUGH!
- (KETIL GROANING) - (WHACK) (DAN GROANS)
Have you no fucking respect, Dan Anderssen?
This is Hildur's place!
What's the matter with you?
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)
Hey.
Hey.

I'm just getting into something here.
The Special at the Fox is sheep's testicles.
Oh.
Erm...
I wanted to tell you something.
You slept with Ingrid last night.
That was it.
Okay.
Obviously you... already knew.
She's always been in love with you.
Ingrid?
Right, well, erm, I had no idea how little it meant to you.
- You just slept with someone else.

I'll catch you later.
Your pain will not have been for nothing.
I take your pain inside me and now I will set you free.
You go.

They're waiting for you across the River.
I'll see you again soon.
In the land of the dead.
So what do you think?
I think it's crazy.
Crazier than a mercenary working at the Blue Fox?
Or anything else that's been going on around here?
(INGRID SIGHS)
Petra.

So...

- She drives.

She parks by the door.
Because there's always spaces there.
She fights with Eric, then she comes back out here and she runs to the bay.
- Where Dan pulls her of the water.

So where's her car?
Hi, Dad.
Have you seen your mother today?
No, I left early.

Did you see her last night?
What?

Where can she go?

- Her car's missing.

- That's right.

(THRILLING MUSIC)
Hello, Mr. Anderssen.

(GRUNTS)
What are you looking for?
There's something going on with your mother, something she wasn't telling me.
I felt it for a while.
Looking for...

Anything that doesn't belong here.
- People always burn that shit.

Shit people want to hide from people.

Bed stuff.
Bed stuff with blood on.
Dad.

- Who cares about that now?

Ketil Blakstvedt.

- Oh, God.

The outhouse.
I've looked here before...
More blood, right?
I'm so sorry.

Said what?
She lied to me.

When Eric shot him, he was here.
- Ingrid, who?

- Vladek?

Vladek is the one that's been cutting people up?
Why has he taken Mum?
(ENGINE REVS)
(SHE PANTS)
Don't get too close.
This is the body of a young woman found out on the ice yesterday, she died within the last twenty four hours.
She was wearing a Russian Army uniform, so I assume she's from Vukobejina.
Can you turn the lights back up again please?
There's a milky deposit inside her mouth.

I'd like your help me with the analysis.
There are some anomalies that are way beyond my competence.
Why have you removed her eye?
I haven't.
She did.
I found eye tissue and blood under her finger nails.
There's no doubt that she clawed out her own eye.
There are insect bites on her neck, and hands and face, looks like black fly to me.
Also present on our polar bear and reindeer.
You'd expect that, no?
My point is, when they bite... black flies, they inject this powerful anticoagulant, it's a prime vector for parasites like river blindness.
It's in the insects, it's in the wildlife... and now it's in humans.
- What is?

We have to keep this completely between ourselves.
I agree.

That's good work, Vince.
You should go home.
Listen, erm, I'm... sorry if I hurt you.
Can we get a drink later?
If you're up to it.

Thanks.

Where is everybody?
Dan's not answering his phone.

Ralfi Sigurdsson said he saw him driving off inland.
When he does that, he can disappear for weeks.
- What about Ingrid?

(MUNK SIGHS)
Well.

He's been taken in to the Research Centre and Dr. Khatri says he could be very ill.
Why not the hospital?
It's far beyond the capabilities of Dr. Adebimpe.
So, what progress have you made?
We can't find Hildur's car.
What?

I-I-I-I made it perfectly clear we had other priorities.
I've searched every street and carpark in town.

Hildur committed suicide.
Yes.

Well, she could have hidden it beforehand!
Yes.

I'm going to see Dan.
Are you suggesting that, err, Hildur is another victim of this psychopath?
Yes, Governor.

Dan isn't allowed any vi-visitors.
(MONITOR BEEPING)
(DOOR BUZZES)
How did you get in here?
I have to take him, now.
- Step aside.

It'll take a lot more than that now.
His value to science is unquantifiable.
- His value to you, you mean.

No you can't.
(TASER CRACKLING)
But I can.
The canning factory, several deserted farmhouses.
- Somewhere isolated.

The mines.
Let's go.
- It'll be dark soon.

You two are staying here.
(DOOR OPENS)
(SHE BREATHES HEAVILY)
Oh.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)
Dan?
Dan!
Dan?
Elena?
(WHIMPERS)
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
- _

(SCREAMS)
It's ok.

FREYA!
DAN!
