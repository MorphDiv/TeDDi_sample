Previously on Rogue...
Got anything to drink?
You're not staying.
I missed you.
I may be dealing with a dirty cop.
He's an old man.
This is Clea Annou's personnel file.
Figure out which side of the line she's on.
Is everything all right?
If you go near them again,
You cross me and those kids will end up dead.
Do you have a record of the buyer?
I found Jameson's apartment.
What's that, like, for an 8-year-old?
Jesus.
You sick motherfucker.
Hey, can you bag this for me?
Yo.
Ah, yeah.
Hey.
I just acquired.
Ah...
No, it means, uh, the slaughtering of certain mammals and birds for food according to Jewish dietary law.
Mmm.
A Kosher death is a humane death.
Bleeds out quickly.
A cow knows when its time has come.
They can sense it and in that moment, we're all seeking the same thing.
Shalom...
Peace.
Now, assuming that you're not in the mood for a lecture, as interesting as it is.
But your cash is all tied up right now.
But you did set aside the 100 for improvements on the bar,
I'll front you that and I'll kick in the rest.
"Juice," he says?
I'm not some nickel-and-dime loan shark, I'm a businessman.
Four hundred large at 11%.
That spot doesn't feel so soft.
It could have been 18%.
A Jew, he comes to me asking for $5,000, maybe $6,000, you'd think that this guy was asking for the world and you, my friend, you don't even blink for half a mil.
Thank you.
Oh, but you just bought it.
I need the money.
That joint was on the market for eight months, it ain't gonna be a quick sale.
Is this for the mashugana cop?
You been in town less than a month and there's already girl troubles?
This girl's been following me a lot longer.
Next time, keep driving to Portland.
Thank you, my friend.
How do they look?
I like that last one.
They're not for you to like.
They're to slap into a passport.
You can still look hot for your passport.
I don't wanna look hot.
I wanna look average.
Well, I'm sorry, babe, you're fucked, 'cause that ain't gonna happen.
Who do you wanna be?
Mmm-hmm.
That's the beauty in starting over.
Well, I don't care who I am, as long as I'm with you.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Ah!
I gotta go.
Are you kidding?
You're leaving me blue-balled here?
I gotta go get our money.
After that we're gone.
Where?
Anywhere we damn well please.
Why don't you think about that?
Come on, you son-of-a-bitch.
Where the fuck are you?
What the fuck is this?
It's all I could get my hands on.
You think this is a joke?
This isn't about how much time I have.
This is about you paying what you owe.
That's all you're gonna get.
You think I'm fucking around here?
Anything happens to those kids...
It's on you.
Fuck.
Hey, Ira, it's me.
If you're looking for more gelt, it's not gonna happen.
I don't need any more money.
I need the boys stationed outside a house in Richmond.
With what?
Just put it on my tab.
Look, Ira,
I'm asking for your help, please.
Because it's you, boychik.
That them?
That's them.
So what do we do now?
Now we watch.
Little Evie told me a joke, you wanna hear it?
Is it funny?
For a 6 year old.
Go on then.
What kind of bee makes milk?
I don't know, what kind of bee makes milk.
A boob-bee.
That's pretty funny.
I went to her dad's restaurant yesterday and spoke with her and, uh, my gut says that she's on the right side of the line.
So maybe she's looking into Oaks herself, that's why she took the files.
We should approach her, see if she can be useful.
What?
I'm basically a CI, right?
I mean, I'm providing you with information to build a case.
But?
But I've no legal standing.
Jesus.
You asked me to stay close to him, so I did.
Oh, so, now you're doing me a favor?
You came to me!
Regan, I'm not going to jail.
Whatever this prick has on you, you think
I knew it!
Well?
Help us secure a prosecution, then it would be up to the DA.
Usually, providing they furnish us with useful, actionable intel, the DA has no interest in prosecuting an active CI.
The thought never crossed my mind.
Of course it didn't.
Oaks gave me $20,000 yesterday.
At least I know you're on the straight and narrow.
It's not that, the money could be marked.
After Oaks ripped off this drug dealer, he said he had to pay taxes on the take.
I think he's kicking up to somebody.
The question is who.
Well, lucky for you, you have a highly motivated CI working with you.
Ah!
I'll be right there.
Fuck you, Kelly.
Who the fuck is Clea Annou?
He still in there?
Yep.
License and registration.
Sure.
You're the guy who came into my restaurant last night.
Clea, right?
You were seen breaking and entering into a house on Clayton Drive.
You mind telling me why?
Research.
You know that's a cop's house you broke into?
I do.
Step out of the car please.
Put your hands on the roof.
The house belongs to Casey Oaks.
He's dirty as the day is long.
But you already know that.
That's why you took the case files, right, Clea?
Who are you?
I know you've been looking into him.
Something we both have in common, along with the Assistant District Attorney, Regan Faulkner.
Put your hands behind your back.
You don't believe me, you can call...
Now!
Okay.
Clea, call the DA's office and ask for Regan Faulkner.
Or arrest me and blow your opportunity to nail Oaks to the wall.
It's up to you.
Where have you been?
Thinking.
I've been worried sick.
Holy shit!
You did it.
He fucked us.
What are you talking about?
Look at this, we're rich!
Sadie, how much money do you think is in there?
Jesus!
Sadie, he owes me $15,000,000 and now he thinks that he can fucking play me!
Babe, this is a lot of money.
Let's take it, let's get out of here.
Are you serious?
Do you have any idea what I had to go through with this guy, the things that I had to do?
I had him all over me.
I had his dick inside me.
It makes me sick.
And now he thinks that he can take what's mine.
Mmm-mmm.
Babe, I understand you're upset.
Upset?
You have no idea.
No, I came here to get what's mine and I'm going to get it!
I thought you came here for me.
Oh, God, Sadie, don't be a fucking child, right now.
Right, I am not in the mood.
It's just, um...
Hey, look at me.
I'm doing this for us, you know that.
That's a lot of money.
Yeah, but it's not what he owes me, what he owes us.
I say we just take it and go.
You know what I say?
How about we take some of that money, and we treat ourselves.
Let's go spend an obscene amount of money.
You broke into his house?
So you didn't know about this?
Ethan's a CI.
Which is not a free pass to do what you damn well feel like.
I was showing initiative.
That's one way to put it.
He's providing intel on Oaks.
But I can't build an effective case without someone in the department.
So you want my help?
We do.
Why do you care?
Oaks has something on you, doesn't he?
She's got your number.
What does he have on you?
That's between him and I.
So what, I have skeletons, show me a CI that doesn't.
You know, I saw you coming out of that house in Bayview.
I thought you were dirty.
Bayview?
When was that?
A few days ago, I guess.
On Thomas Avenue?
What were you doing there?
Oaks had me deliver $50,000 to a guy by the name of Pierre.
He brought the money to Thomas Avenue.
A few minutes later, you come out, you got in your car,
I thought he brought you the cash.
Did Oaks ever mention the name Dominique Lacour to you?
What about Maria Alvarado?
I think that money was payment, to a nurse named Dominique Lacour, for delivering a lethal overdose to a young girl named Maria Alvarado.
Looks like Detective Oaks is a busy man.
That's him.
Answer it.
Yeah?
Right.
He got another job for me.
Looks like we're on.
License and registration, please, sir.
Thank you.
What d'you think you're doing?
Face the car, hands on the roof.
You smashed my light!
Now, sir!
Hold on.
These for me?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Atta-boy.
Hey.
I'll be right back.
What's this about?
Take this to Cardello's on Union.
Do not open that envelope.
That is a good question, Donahue.
That is a good fucking question.
Beautiful.
There's just...
One thing missing though.
Your server will be right with you.
Between 1937 and 2012, an estimated 1,600 bodies have been recovered of people who have jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge.
One thousand six hundred.
It's incredible.
What are you going to do with me?
They reckon only 26 people survived the jump.
It's fucking tragic.
You a good swimmer?
And she will have the Beluga caviar, followed by the lobster rigatoni.
Exquisite choice, madam.
Thank you.
See how nice people are to you when you have money?
Open it.
Oh, my God!
Can we afford this?
Just let me put it on you.
Mmm.
Perfect.
And then there's Ed Wutke...
The first prisoner to commit suicide in Alcatraz.
Yeah?
I can't ever get a pencil sharpener to actually work.
1937,
Rufe Persful...
Persful.
Feels good, doesn't it?
He got an ax from a fire truck, chopped off four fingers of his left hand in an attempt to get transferred outta there.
When that failed, he tried to cut off his feet!
I mean, talk about dedication!
Oh!
Hey, how's the food?
I'm not hungry.
Nobody showed.
What?
Who said anyone was taking it?
Then what am I doing here?
Well, I was hoping you were having a nice steak, a glass of Merlot maybe.
It'd be a damn shame if you're not.
Bring the envelope back to me.
Excuse me?
Bring it back to me, where we met and I'll be waiting for you.
You gonna ask me what this is about?
You're not the only one taking orders around here, you know?
All right, let's go.
Back to your car.
Fuck off!
Compliments of the gentleman at the bar.
Let's go have some fun.
That is so...
What's the word I'm looking for?
I couldn't help but notice two beautiful ladies such as yourselves.
What made you think that we wanted a bottle of champagne?
How exactly did you think this was gonna go?
And then we come over here, purring with gratitude.
And you charm us with...
And I'm just taking a stab here...
Your sub-Ivy-League education and then what?
We get wet?
I mean, we just can't help ourselves.
And then you take one of us home.
Or maybe both.
And you fuck our brains out.
Maybe she goes down on me.
While you sit there and jerk off.
Is that how you thought this was going to go?
I, uh...
Okay, just humor me here.
Look at her...
And now look at you.
Look at her.
And now you.
What makes you think, if I can fuck that, that I would ever wanna fuck you?
You're a fucking bitch.
Bye.
Did you have fun?
I had fun.
I had a lot of fun.
Imagine living like that.
Every day.
Like a fucking queen.
I deserve that.
So do you.
I do.
Say it with conviction.
I deserve to live like a fucking queen.
Yes!
Damn straight.
Let's start with this purse,
$19,999.
One diamond necklace,
$29,799.
Food... $476.85.
Two bottles of Sine Qua Non,
A Shot in the Dark Syrah,
$850.
That's... $51,965.85.
That's just one night.
That's before we find a house we deserve to live in, the cars that we deserve to drive, by the way I'm going for 2013 Mercedes Brabus 800 Roadster.
What about you?
I always wanted a Porsche 911.
Ooh, old-school, I can respect that.
So that's another $850,000 plus let's say the 911 is like $100,000...
I hate to tell you this babe, but we're broke.
Ethan Kelly has $15,000,000 of my money.
Of your money.
He pays us what he owes us.
And we live the life that we deserve.
It's decision time.
You in...
Or are you out?
I say...
Let's go get our money.
That's my girl.
Someone not get their vitamin C this morning?
Check this out.
That's not my color.
Noted.
That is why you make sure to hydrate before committing a double murder at a residential home.
You use this technique to get laid, don't you?
Ah, you know, whatever it takes.
They're 100% worsted wool from a trusted mill with a super thread count of 120.
They're worth, like, $3,500 each.
You're talking to a T-shirt- and-jeans kind of girl.
I know, but you make it look so good.
Okay, so once I narrowed it down, I examined the house cut.
Now Brits like a roomier fit, with a smoother drape which this suit has.
How many British tailors are there in the city?
Hundred and fifty.
Well, normally, I'd balk at the size of that pool but I love a British accent.
But your guy, he sewed the silk from the dresses of all the girl's into the inside of every single one of his suit jackets.
Yeah, he also sewed it into the crotch of his pants.
Sick fuck wanted to feel them on his skin when he wasn't with them.
What about the secondary lining?
There's only one tailor who uses this signature color fabric.
He puts it in every single suit jacket.
Trevor Beasley, on Clay Street.
There is a vat of my father's Jambalaya in your future.
Don't tease me, Annou.
Hi, Trevor Beasley?
Detective Clea Annou, Major Crimes.
No, no, no, don't worry, everything's fine.
I was just wondering if you could help me with a case that I'm working on.
The murder of Daniel Jameson.
Do you think that you could come down here?
I think it'd be better if we talk in person.
Detective Clea Annou?
Depends.
You spare me five minutes?
I'm actually just in the middle of something, so if you want to talk to...
This is your personnel file.
Where d'you get that?
I found at a bar belonging to one Ethan Kelly.
You know Kelly?
You first.
Yeah, I know him.
He was...
How do I put this?
Party to the murder of my partner in Chicago.
Kelly's wanted for murder?
No.
He handed the suspect over to me.
And she got away.
That was careless.
I think she's coming after Kelly, to even the score.
Why not go talk to him?
Because she might be watching him.
And if she sees me, I lose the advantage.
He's a CI on a case I'm working.
Kelly is a CI?
Anna Drubeskaya.
She also goes by Mia Rochlan.
I got my number on the back.
Thank you.
Word of advice.
Ethan Kelly is all about self-preservation.
He'll play both sides until the end, and then he'll choose the side that serves him best.
Well, I never trusted a CI.
I don't intend to start now.
Did you get the photos I sent you?
I did.
So he just had you sitting in Carlucio's?
One minute he's ripping off drug dealers, the next minute he's...
Doing what exactly?
He said he was following orders, Regan.
He's a part of something bigger, I'm telling you.
Where's Clea?
She said she was busy.
Is she brushing us off?
No, maybe she doesn't trust us.
Maybe she doesn't trust you.
You know, I got to be honest, this team-building thing you got going on here, it's really effective.
You know why I became a lawyer instead of a cop?
Better dental plan?
So I wouldn't have to do tedious shit like this.
And that attitude is exactly why I never became a lawyer.
You wanted a different kind of glory.
You dropped out a semester shy of graduating...
It didn't matter, Regan.
When those towers went down,
I was going no matter where I was.
There's no glory, Regan, in what I did overseas.
Any regrets?
Not while I was serving, no.
What do you mean?
My regrets came afterwards.
Did you run the plate on that guy's car yet?
Michael Donahue.
Your generally disgruntled, side-lined American citizen.
Look at these receipts.
Oaks has his pool guy coming twice a week.
So?
Well, his pool was filthy, Regan.
Either he's the worst pool guy in all the Bay Area or he wasn't going there to clean it.
It's a reach.
Maybe.
I was saddened to hear of Mr. Jameson's passing.
It was nice to fit someone who actually appreciated the craft.
So you didn't put in this secondary lining?
No.
I would never use blanket stitching on lining.
Too cute in my opinion.
How many suits did you make for Mr. Jameson?
Would he come in for fittings?
Yes, then his driver would come pick them up.
James Richardson?
That's the driver his company provided.
The guy that picked up his suits was Mexican.
Do you remember his name?
Hmm...
Surname started with an F, I think.
Flores?
Yeah, that it.
Miguel Flores.
Are you sure?
Quite sure.
Do you still have his number?
Probably.
Here it is.
Okay, I want you to call him.
Tell him Mr. Jameson paid cash on his last order, a couple of thousand, you want to return the money.
Right.
They're so young.
What did you expect?
You said you were in.
This is what in looks like.
Detective Annou, this is Patrick Finnegan.
Um, I was wondering if, uh...
Just call me if you see her, okay.
Thank you.
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Bingo.
Did you get it?
Yep.
All of our slimmer cuts are to the right.
And all of them with our signature fabric.
Do you think he's actually British, or you think it's all an act?
He's probably from Jersey.
Enjoy.
Shit.
It's like they think you're a miracle worker or something...
They hand you this picture and say,
I want to look like Julia Roberts.
So do I.
Last I checked I wasn't a plastic surgeon.
Then they fire you because you didn't make somebody look like Julia Roberts?
They fired me because I accidentally burned a client with a curling iron.
Oh!
Want another round?
Nice ass.
That's about all that's nice.
Excuse me?
What did you just say?
Was I talkin' to you, chief?
I think you owe somebody an apology.
I think somebody owes somebody an apology.
Why don't you try a push-up bra, sweetheart.
That's not an apology.
Yeah, I like that.
Patrick!
Fuck!
You are one serious fuck-up, Patrick Finnegan.
Harper.
Okay.
It's going to be okay.
It's okay.
What!
Shit.
He's the one who did this to me.
Sir, you're under arrest for battery.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law.
Hey.
Anything on the pool guy?
I hate it when I'm right.
I bet.
Am I under arrest?
Not yet.
Maybe we can keep it that way.
Hmm?
So, you were Mr. Jameson's driver?
Yes.
Except you weren't.
Right?
'Cause I checked with his company, and they've never heard of you.
His official driver...
Is a James Richardson.
So...
What did he need you for?
It was the girls, wasn't it?
You would find him girls...
And you'd bring them back to his apartment?
That's what you did with Maria.
So, I'm just assuming that you did it with others.
There were 24 dresses in his apartment.
Twenty-four.
All the exact same.
Were there 24 different girls?
That's for what, a 10-year-old?
An 8-year-old?
Did you supply him with children, Miguel?
I didn't supply any girls.
I want a lawyer.
Yeah, fucking right, I would too if I were you.
We're done here.
She called for you, you know?
Maria.
She sat right there, where you're sitting right now, on the night that she died,
she kept asking for you.
She kept saying your name.
"Flores, Flores." Just repeating it.
Maybe you could've saved her.
Did you ever have one of the girls, Miguel?
No.
You don't have a thing for underage girls?
I tried to look out for them...
Tell me where he got the girls from, Miguel.
Tell me!
This girl may still be out there.
You let Maria die in a pool of her own piss and blood.
She was calling for you and you fucking abandoned her!
She needed you and you let her die.
You can help this girl.
Tell me where she is!
Fucking tell me!
Okay.
Okay.
That's the door, right there.
Jesus...
We're police.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Detective?
You okay?
No.
Man's inhumanity to man.
Never ceases to amaze me.
The girls were farmed to hotels, conferences, sporting events, and they were always brought back to the basement.
A week ago, the captors cut their hands open, and left, they didn't come back.
The girls were too terrified to leave.
Why did they cut their hands?
Because inside there was a small chip of some kind.
The captors took it.
The girls were told it was some sort of a tracking device.
Make sure they didn't run.
Ingenious.
It's one way to describe it.
Some of the girls recognize Jameson.
He'd make them wear the dresses while he fucked them.
One week ago is when Maria killed him.
That must mean that whoever's running the operation got spooked.
Killed her so she wouldn't talk about what she knows, and then shut the whole thing down.
What about the girl?
There's no cut in her hand.
Which means the tracking device wasn't working.
Or it wasn't a tracking device.
Here's the thing...
She's saying they didn't put the chip in her hand, they put it in her head.
And it's still fucking in there.
