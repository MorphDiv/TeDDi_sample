Ohh wooaah
Ohh wooaah
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart
We're just friends, what are you saying?
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time And I was like...
Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
For you I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down 
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
And I'm like Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
There was nobody that compared to my baby and nobody came between us or could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck, she woke me up daily, dont need no Starbucks.
She made my heart pound, it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and at school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing and now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...
Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
Baby, baby, baby oooh Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
I'm gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah) All I'm gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah) Now I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone...)
I'm gone
