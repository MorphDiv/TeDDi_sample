[seabirds squawking]
[pop song playing in Spanish]
[engine revving]
[laughter]
- No way.

This is the Cuban spirit.
Dom!

[engine roaring, tire squealing] [cheering]
Raldo, you said I... [continues in Spanish]
You know I can't make a living without my car.
It's not my problem, bro.
Dominic Toretto, I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.
Why you hooking up my cousin's car?
Cousin's car.

He needed money.

He can't pay.

I-I just need a few more days.
"Few more days" wasn't part of the deal.
Come on.
You make a deal, you gotta live up to it.
You make a deal...

"Going to live up to it"?
Oh, so you one of those types.
You take everyone's ride and then ship it back to the States?
You know what I respect?
Money.
You watch your mouth.
[laughs]
Now you got a problem.
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.
- You want a car, get it the right way.

Race for it.
I already own it, bro.
Not that car.
- Mine.

[FERNANDO] Dom...
His-his car is the fastest car on the island.
Do you know what he has under that hood?
He knows it doesn't matter what's under a hood.
The only thing that matters is who's behind the wheel.
You think so?
I know so.
Then race his car.
And we ain't racing no quarter-mile here.
We race the Cuban mile.
Done.
[crowd whooping and cheering]
[Fernando speaking Spanish] [engine rumbling]
Listen, I-I appreciate what you're trying to do, but... my car is the slowest car on the island.
Was.
Pull the seats, the doors, the battery.
If it ain't the motor, take it off.
Laughing gas?
Nah, Fed.

[chuckles] You guys are crazy.
- [FERNANDO] What are you doing?

Pull the vacuum line and hold on.
Old trick the Buster used to play, in case of emergencies.
You know that's way too much boost
- for that engine.

It's gonna be a bomb.
Only needs to go a mile.
[engines revving, crowd cheering]
[tires squealing]
[shouts in Spanish]
[horn honking]
[tires squealing, horns honking] [man shouts in Spanish] [tires screeching]
[laughing]
That car belongs in the trash, bro.
[tires squeal] [gas hisses] [engine roars]
[horn honks]
- [tires squealing] - [horn honking]
[horns honking]
[shouting in Spanish] [excited chatter]
[tires squeal, horn honks]
[tires screeching]
[FERNANDO] Where are they going?
[LETTY] I don't know.

- [tires screech] - [man shouts] [phone ringing] [phone beeps]
Ghost him.
Sí.
[startled chatter]
[engine revving]
Adios, Toretto.
[engine rattling]
Okay, Buster.
Let's see if this works.
- [engine revving] - [tires screeching]
That's impossible.
[horns honking]
[tires squeal]
[tires squealing, horn honking]
[cheering]
[tires squealing]
[cheering, excited chatter]
[muttering in Spanish]
[explosive whoosh] [shouts in Spanish]
[tires screeching]
Look out!
[explosive whoosh] [tires squealing]
[cheering]
[cheering, excited chatter]
Hold on.

[crowd murmuring]
A deal's a deal.
[keys jangling]
You won my car.
And you earned my respect.
Keep your car.
Your respect is good enough for me.
[DOM] Yo, cousin.
Sorry about your car.
Yours was too slow for a Toretto anyway.
Your Impala?
Are you serious?
[cheering]
[pop song playing in Spanish]
Look at that smile.
I love it when you smile.
You make me happy.
Mmm, I think this place makes you happy.
It's like it speaks to you.
You remember that guy...

The one with the boat engine under the hood?
Yeah.
- Yeah.

I was...

[laughing] No, no, no, no!

Is that what you want?
It's not about what I want or what you want.
It's about why we haven't asked the question.
And do you have enough faith in the world?
I'll always ride for us.
Yeah, but would you ride for the world?
You hungry?
Mm-hmm.
- Same thing?

Two minutes.
[vehicle engine sputtering]
[engine continues sputtering]
[speaks Spanish]
What?
You need a hand?
Yeah, I think I do.
Thank you.
Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.
- Yeah?

Let's see if we can get some power to it.
What brings you to Cuba?
Same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba.
Culture, people, beauty.
What brings you to Cuba?
Work.
Must be casual Friday.
How's that honeymoon going, Dom?
[DOM] Your fuel relay is missing.
I know.
I love to play games...

Oh, this is a very different game.
That I can assure you.
This...
There is something much greater at work here.
This is fate.
I choose to make my own fate.
Not today.
Is this the road you take to your apartment every morning?
What else is different, Dom?
Was Santiago's closed?

What is it, black, no sugar?
Yeah.
I put a lot of work into getting you here today.
Well, now that I'm here, what do you want?
I want you to work for me.
Work for you?
Oh, I could have saved you a lot of time, then.
See, I don't work for anyone.
You can't walk away from this, Dom.
We're gonna have this conversation, one way or the other.
You see, that's the funny thing about fate.
It's cunning.
It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
Oh, you're gonna want to work for me.
You're gonna betray your brothers, abandon your code and shatter your family.
You see, your team is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.
And what's that?
You.
Oh, and, Dom,
I wouldn't mention this to anyone.
[engine starts] [vehicle drives away]
[HOBBS] They are gonna be hitting us with everything they got.
So we want to engage with maximum speed.
Neutralize their shooters, and then move on to our objective.
There's two things I want you to keep in mind.
Number one...

And number two...

Everyone... and I mean everyone... manis and pedis at the mall later on today.
[cheering]
Huh?
[MAN] One, two three!
- [blows whistle] - [GIRLS] Monarchs!
[chanting in Maori]
[girls respond in Maori] [chants in Maori] [girls respond in Maori]
(call-and-response Maori chant continues)
Yah!
- What?

I don't want to play anymore.
All right, let's go, girls.

Final two minutes.
[MAN] Quite the cheering section.
- [quiet chuckling] - [HOBBS] Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, it's the moms, they come out to support the kids.
Except there seem to be more moms than kids.
Way more moms.
[murmuring, chuckling] [chuckles] Yeah.

Let's go, girls!
So, your intel was spot-on.
That Damocles 7 EMP weapon that went missing in the Gulf... arms dealers from the Liberation Front
- have it in Berlin.

This thing can wipe out an entire electrical grid in a major city.
No lights, no power...

Chloe, Maya, you can't let her run by you like that.
- Let's go, let's go!

- what's at stake here?

Yes, I know exactly what is at stake here, okay?
If the Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragons, that means we lose the championship...

Which then means I have to spend a lot of time in ice cream shops and spend a lot of time at Tay Tay concerts.
Tay Tay?
Come...

Gotta be shittin' me.
Get it together, okay?
- Let's go, girls.

We need you to do this.
It's a lot of lives at stake.
- All right, but I need to be clear here.

The U.S. government cannot sanction this operation in any way.
- You're on your own.

This thing goes sideways, you don't just get burned, you go to prison.
And there's nothing we can do to get you out.
Let me tell you something.
The only thing that I love more than saving lives is my daughter.
So, if you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons,
I'm gonna have all 20 of them line up and kick you right in the tay-tay.
Go, Dragons.
Say it again.
- Go, Dragons!

Go, Dragons.

Go.

- Go, go!

- [laughs] - [whistle blows]
That is my daughter right there.

[chuckles] Yes, come here.
- How did I do?

Nice job, kid.
- [Hobbs sighs]

Uh, yeah.
Daddy's gotta go to work.
Now, you're gonna need to get a team you can trust.
Oh, I already got one.
[cell phone buzzing]
[sighs]
- [HOBBS] Hey, Dom.

I got a job in Berlin, and I need a favor, brother.
No problem.

Thanks, man.

[explosions] [crickets chirping]
You were only supposed to create a diversion, Roman.
That was a diversion!
How many of the damn explosives did you use?
I don't know, Tej.

- Wait, all of it?

You got more of your fan club ahead.
[tires squealing] [rapid gunfire]
They're still on us.
These guys are taking this personal.
Roman, we just blew up their facility and stole their EMP.
Other than your doctor's cold finger,
I'd say it's about as personal as it can get.
Phase two.
Phase two?

What happened to phase one?

Yeah.

Everyone drove their cars out but you?
I told you my engine seized up.
It's your balls that seized up.
Just follow my lead, okay?
And, Roman, whatever you do... don't think.
What?
Tej, drop it.
Bombs away.
Split now.
Holy...!
[shouts in German]
[ROMAN] Great plan, Tej.
But just so you know, you missed some.
Oh, just wait for it.
[cable creaking]
[ROMAN] Oh, shit!
I hate you, Tej!
[laughs]
Got your ass.
You good?
I'll see you when it's done.
All right, great job, team.

[tires squealing]
A hell of a job, brother.
When we get back to the base, beer's on me.
- [grunting, panting] - [car door opens]
[groaning]
You lost your goddamn mind, Toretto?
Toretto, you put hands on that thing, you're gonna have the whole world gunning for you, including me.
[grunting]
I don't know what you're doing, but you better think about this, Toretto.
It ain't too late to stop this.
- It is now.

- [sirens blaring] - [tires screech]
That sumbitch just crossed us.
- What?

What are you talking about?
Dom took the EMP.
Bullshit.
Where are you?
[HOBBS] It's too late for me.

He wrecked my truck and he took it.
I saw that look in his eye, and I've seen that look before.
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.
[sirens blaring]
[sirens blaring]
[alarm buzzing]
[TEJ] All right, I got his phone records, y'all.
It's a whole bunch of calls to untraceable numbers.
[ROMAN] Burner phones, right?
[TEJ] Nah.

Same number, but they got some sort of micro-router to bury the signal path, which means Dom is clearly communicating with somebody that's above our pay grade.
Look, I don't know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts...
Dom's been having highly encrypted conversations with some mysterious person.
He took out Hobbs.
He stole an EMP.

So, what are you saying?
[RAMSEY] Maybe we should consider the fact that Hobbs is right.
Dom did go rogue.
[car door slams]
[ROMAN] Letty.
We're all in this trying to figure it out, okay?
We're on the side.
You sure about that, Roman?
Before you judge the man, remember, you're breathing right now because he saved your life.
You just gonna let her bump your shoulder like that?
I'm-I'm just saying, that...

What you gonna do, e-mail her?
[sighs]
Check.
[buzzer sounds]
Moment, will you, fellas?
Thank you.
Well, this is an exciting new look.
It's a little tight in the crotch, as always.
[Mr. Nobody chuckles]
What boy-band bus did she fall out of?
It's my new junior associate.

- All yours.

Mr. Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.
All you have to do is agree to the terms, and you're free.
What's Training Wheels talking about?

Confess to your crimes in Berlin.
Treason, international espionage, massive destruction of civic property.
You do that, we close the case.
- And?

- Germany loves that.

- you will be a criminal.

You need to work on your delivery, all right?
Unofficially... you're off the books.
You come work with me.
I'm not a criminal.
[MR. NOBODY] Luke, come on.

There is no confession.
There are no backroom deals.
Got myself into this, I'm gonna get myself out of it.
- You know that.

Well, there you have it.
Good luck in the courts, man.
What about your daughter?
You know, if you're not gonna do it for your country, at least do it for your kid.
[chuckling] Big mistake, kid.
[grunting]
Hold on.

He's still working from the manual.
I mean, he doesn't even really know the rules.
Now, come on, give him a break.
[strained] Give me a break.
Luke.
[grunts, groans]
- Appreciate it.

It's good to see you, Nobody.
You, too.
[coughing continues]
- Rule number one...

Know your audience.
I gave you your shot.

Now I'm gonna show you how to get this done.
[PRISONER] You're mine now, copper!
[PRISONER 2] Yeah, that badge don't go far in here!
[PRISONER 3] You're dead, cop.

[PRISONER 4] I'm gonna slice some bacon off your back, pig!
[DECKARD] Well, well, well.
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that.
The bent cop got his day.
[buzzer sounds, lock clicks]
You know, that color looks good on you.
Yeah, it'd look a whole hell of a lot better with your blood on it.
Yeah, good luck with that, Hercules.
Lawman gone bad, huh?
Such a cliché.
Oh, well, welcome to the club.
I wouldn't get that twisted, son.
We ain't in no club.

And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
So why don't you get your candy-ass back out there and toss some more salads, boy.
What, you bring a shovel, did you?
Because it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.
Or so I've been told.
[Deckard chuckling]
Better get to digging.
You wanker.
Yeah.
Move.
Say that again.
If I say it again, it'll be to a corpse.
[chuckles]
I'm going to enjoy this.
[WOMAN] Welcome back, Dom.
Nice job out there.
You excited about tonight?
You're going on this?
You're with me, Dom.
I am impressed.
That job went down exactly like we planned.
It is something to watch somebody at the top of their game.
It must've been a real thrill from 30,000 feet.
Oh, come on, there has to be a small part in you that enjoyed what you just did back there.
No?

Showing me your shoe collection?
Yep.
A pair for every occasion.
You have enough guns in here to outfit a small army, huh?
This?

You know what I like about you, Dom?
You're a genuine outlaw.
I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.
Which is surprising because, when I saw you in Cuba,
I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle, and you let him keep his car?
Oh, that confused you?
Hmm.
Of course I could have taken his car.
Of course I could have beaten him down.
But it's about something bigger.
This way...
I changed him.
That's not your responsibility.
But it's who I am.
Let me ask you something, Dom.
What's the best thing in your life?
Family.
No, it's not.
Not if you're being honest.
It's the ten seconds between start and finish when you're not thinking about anything.
No family.
No obligations.
Just you... that engine... that open road... being free.
I gotta tell you, this whole saving-the-world,
Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently... it's bullshit.
It's not you.
Be who you are.
Why live only a quarter mile at a time when you can live your whole life that way?
[panting, grunting]
Is that it?
Is that all those bloated-out muscles will give you?
All show and no go.
[grunts]
[grunts]
[grunting]
Oh, I got plenty of go.
Yeah?
You must have misplaced that when I kicked your arse up and down that office of yours.
Yeah.
Just like you Brits...

All I know is it wasn't me that was thrown out of a four-story window.
Jumped.
I jumped out of a four-story window saving my partner's life.
'Cause where I'm from, we don't settle fights by throwing bombs.
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue.
- [knuckles cracking]

Let me tell you something.
Me and you, one on one, no one else around...
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.
Maybe one day we'll find out.
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.
[buzzer sounds]
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.
I'll get out my way.
[alarm whooping]
The right way!
Hey!

Relax.

- Get back!

[Hobbs and Deckard panting]
Well, that took longer than I expected.
- [HOBBS] Two questions.

- My daughter?

Toretto?
[chuckling] It's interesting you ask.
This is my new base.
Welcome to nowhere.
It's a little sterile for you.
[chuckles] Listen, there's something
I want to talk to you about after.
Hey, listen, guys, thanks...

Handcuffs?

It's called abuse of power.
You told me to round them up.
I didn't tell you to hand...
Cut 'em loose.

[chuckling] This is embarrassing.
I'm sorry, guys.

So, this is how you treat old friends?
[TEJ] Friends?

- who the hell this guy is.

- I'm, like, nobody, okay?

Him?

Tej, trust me, brother, that's a maze you don't want to get lost in.
Clearly, we're getting nowhere with nobody.
I've been in here for four hours, and my ribs are showing.
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.
- I wouldn't recommend that.

Well, thanks to your botched Berlin job, you all made Interpol's top ten most wanted list.
- Top ten.

That's all right.
Yeah.

- What do you mean?

You're number 11, so...
- I...

- [ROMAN] That's impossible.

What number did they come in at?
Six, eight, nine, ten.
- She's ten?

She just got here.

There's no way she's a ten.
Oh, she's definitely a ten.
[chuckles] What?
[MR. NOBODY] How about we focus on someone who we're not gonna find on anybody's list.
We're awaiting hard confirmation, but I believe that's the cyber terrorist known as Cipher.
Wait, no.
Cipher's an organization, not... not a person.
Not according to our sources.
- What does she want?

Cipher is like a digital act of God.
They...

Anything that can be hacked is hers to play with.
And here's the kicker...

Her digital identity is scrubbed every few seconds worldwide.
Six years of the intelligence community's coordinated efforts have turned up nothing but this single photo.
So, basically, she's the bogeyman.
Damn, she's... one of the hottest bogeymans I've ever seen.
I mean, if y'all know her, tell her to get at your boy.
- [Roman chuckles] - [kicks chair]
- What are you, 12?

Let's just say, people are scared of the hacker group Anonymous.
But even Anonymous won't mess with her.
What the hell does any of this have to do with us?
Probably nothing, Letty, but I do find it interesting that, apparently, for some reason, she's now working with this guy.
[sighs]
Do you know why?
Gee, no, Letty, I don't.
He's already delivered a fully operational EMP into her hands.
Detonate that, they can turn any city in the world into a war zone.
So, then, what is it you're suggesting we do?
[MR. NOBODY] Maybe we find Dom, huh?
Well, first, let's catch him and then figure out why he's turned.
And we put a stop to whatever bullshit they got planned.
So, y'all want us to track Dom.
Yeah, I know, Roman, it's kind of a big job.
It's impossible.
Which is why I'm bringing in an extra pair of hands.
[beep, buzzing]
Ah, my day just got a whole hell of a lot better.
Mr. Nobody, you want to tell me why you just put me in a room with this tea and crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?
What a big mouth on a small head, coming from prisoner 6753.
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.
We are not teaming up with this guy.
Let's get one thing clear...

I don't care about you, your crew or your little family.
- I'm here for Cipher.

You know, I think that tight T-shirt's cutting off the circulation to your brain.
You should get a bigger size.
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.
When I said no, she went after my brother.
Ah, yes, brother Owen.
Who could forget him, huh?
Former hell-raiser and current guest at a nasty little black-site prison.
Cipher corrupted him and left him for dead.
So, if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.
You're taking my boot right up your ass
- is what you're taking.

The fastest way to find Cipher is through Toretto.
Now, aside from myself, there's only two men in the world that have ever managed to actually track him down with any success.
And guess what... they're both standing in front of me right now.
So, like it or not, you two are gonna work together.
You got that?
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
Am I the only one seeing this?
Oh, this ought to be good.
[stammers]
Use God's Eye.
We put our lives on the line, running around the world trying to figure this thing out.
It can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.
It's that easy.

Roman, that is a great idea.
Did you hear that?

No, no, no, no, no, don't tune it out, huh?

See, you and this guy, right here.
Stay out of my lane, dude.
It's all me right here, you know what I mean?
It's crazy.
Mr. Nobody, let's fire it up, huh?
- [TEJ] Got him.

Yeah.
[computer beeping]
[RAMSEY] Wait.

[ROMAN] Beijing and Seoul.
[TEJ] And Tokyo.
[Ramsey sighs]
[RAMSEY] And just about every other major city
- on the planet.

God's Eye was where we started.
But Cipher's already created an evasion that masks their location by pinging random spots all over the globe, but it was a good thought, Roman.
So, she's made my program obsolete.
And that, Ramsey, is why you're here.
See, simple solutions aren't gonna cut it here, slick.
Why you look at me when you say that?
[TEJ] Wait a second.
Wait, wait.

You see, in order for God's Eye to give off all these false pings, means they have to be using a FLEA relay.
Watch these two.
Which means it has a decaying sync randomizer.
Which we can reverse...
And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location.
- [snaps fingers] - [MR. NOBODY] I'm telling you, they got skills.
That was my idea.

- Remember in there?

Let's try this.
It's working.
[HOBBS] Time you want to check your manual and start organizing a force response.
Let's get a hold of our international assets...
He's still green.
Yeah, like fresh baby shit.
Soon as we have Toretto's location, I want to mobilize.
Let's get a hold of a better asshole.
Uh, no one respects you, uh...

- Cover.

No problem.

Mm...

All right, they're not in China.
Or Russia.
Europe's clear.
But this one's not going away.
This is interesting.
Why?
Because that's here.
Pull up all security monitors on this building, now.
Surprise.
[yells]
[rapid beeping]
[rapid beeping continues] [grunts, yells]
[grunting]
[team groaning and coughing] [groaning]
[CIPHER] [echoing] Did you all enjoy that?
Next-generation concussion grenade.
It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, it will wear off in an hour.
Probably.
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.
[Cipher chuckling]
Look at this.

Your family's already replacing you.
You chose the losing team.
I guess your brother is smarter than you.
[coughing, groaning] [team continues groaning and coughing]
[high-pitched ringing]
Smart move embedding God's Eye into the mainframe.
Irritating to make me have to come all the way down here to get it, but...
Let's go.
[team groaning]
Dom!
[groaning and coughing continue]
You gonna turn your back on family?
Just like that?
Let's go.
[quiet, distant chatter]
You okay?
That wasn't him.
I don't know what she's got on him, but that wasn't Dom.
Brian would know what to do.
No!
We can't bring Brian and Mia into this.
We agreed on that.
[ROMAN] I know.
You saved me.
I'm...

No need.
You got a computer I can use?
That I do.
[talking low, indistinctly]
Psst, yo.
[quietly] What, man?
You see this?
Like, they really going at it over there.
Must be the accent.
Bro... he ain't got no accent to her.
They're from the same place.
- Uh, yeah, I was...

I got the accent.

Exotic?
Barstow?
Ghetto?
Barstow is exotic to her.
[scoffs]
[DOM] Back there, was that for her, for me or you?
And was it even necessary?
Necessary?
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.
And I simply made one, but so did you.
You could have stopped me, but you chose not to.
Wonder what Letty thought about that.
The problem with putting your foot on a tiger's neck is you can never let it up.
I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
[gasps]
Elena.
Dom.
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have come.
Nothing could have kept me away.
Now she has the three of us.
[baby coos]
Do you want to see him?
See Papa?
Yeah.

Come and see Papa.
Papa.
[baby coos]
When I realized I was pregnant, you had just found out Letty was alive.
[baby babbling]
So I decided, when Letty and you got back from your honeymoon,
I was going to tell you.
And then she took us before I had the chance.
[cooing]
His name?
I call him Marcos.
But that's his middle name.
I thought his father should give him his first name.
I'm sorry, Dom.
There's nothing to be sorry for.
[ELENA] Whatever happens just save our son.
Your son.
[Marcos cooing]
[door opens] [door closes]
[CIPHER] Good visit?
I know.

I just let the guards go, so there's only two opponents in the room.
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first.
I know you.
You have the will so you'll find the way.
Once you've got it, you'll take him out.
Maybe even me.
And then you're thinking...
Elena's a cop.
Maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.
It's so much to think about.
[inhales deeply] [exhales]
Let me make it easier for you.
Do with it as you wish.
Have you heard of choice theory, Dom?
There is a bunch of axioms, but only two you really need to concern yourself with.
One...

And two...

So let me give you some.
You see these cameras in here?
The moment you make a move, highly paid men with weapons will make their way into this room with one very specific instruction.
It's not to save me.
It's to kill your son.
Now, that's a lot of bullets, and it only takes one for you to lose everything.
So I have to ask you because...
I know family is so important to you.
Is that really a choice you want to make?
Because I'm ready if you are.
If I pull this trigger...

I still couldn't get in there.
'Cause of your two-man fail-safe system.
Since I'm alone!
I got no choice!
I didn't think so.
[Elena's breaths trembling]
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch.
[sobbing]
[ELENA] [crying] Bitch.
- Don't... don't...

Please!
Damn it.
She wiped it all.
Took God's Eye.
That was the one thing we could use to find them.
We lost everything.
What you got, princess?
Finding Toretto.
But I got a couple of minutes to spare, if you want me to send you to the hospital... again.
[chuckles] Yo, Rules.
- First off, that's not my name.

- Don't call me that.

Great.

We find Toretto together as a team.
And when all this is said and done, I'll be happy to slap that dick garage right off his face.
[RAMSEY] Wait a minute, guys.
I think Deckard's actually onto something.
How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?
Ghost flights.
[TEJ] I thought untraceable aircraft was all
- Internet conspiracy stuff.

Satellites and radar grids all across the globe shift like an ocean.
And they've got channels that open and close.
And theoretically, if you know the right people who know the right patterns...
You can fly right through the blind spots completely undetected.
So, you know where Dom is headed?
[computer beeps]
Yeah.

[laughing]
You see there, Luke?

You guys are gonna get along just great.
Which proves rule number two...

Fire up the chopper.
Well, guys, have a ball in the Big Apple.
♪ I'm with the gang, gang, gang ♪
♪ And we 'bout to go up ♪
♪ Switching lanes, it's a thang every time we show up ♪
♪ You lame, lame, lame, and you so below us ♪
♪ Bet your ho she know us ♪
♪ 'Cause you know we blowed up ♪
♪ We stay down... ♪
[ROMAN] And why are we traveling like this again?
[TEJ] Because Dom took God's Eye.
So we need to stay off the grid.
[ROMAN] But like this?
[sniffs, groans]
Look here, man.

That's a good question, Roman.
Let me show you.
[engines revving]
Welcome to our new base of operations.
No, seriously, what is this place?
[TEJ] This... is heaven.
[HOBBS] It's the agency garage.
They call it the Toy Shop.
This is where we house every vehicle seized from drug dealers on the East Coast.
Now, Mr. Nobody said,
"If we're gonna have a chance at catching Dom we're gonna have to be damn fast."
Figured this would help.
You got anything American?
What's the matter with you, huh?
Miss America.
What, are you allergic to quality?
This is the most durable British vehicle ever built.
Oops.
I peed in your tea.
- [clattering]

We got a tank.
750-horsepower, 6.6-liter V-8 Duramax engine with an M153 CROWS remotely operated weapons station on top.
You didn't get this from drug dealers.
[LITTLE NOBODY] No.

It's a Ripsaw unmanned combat vehicle.
Did you hear something?
See, the Army's developing machines like this that soldiers can drive from a mile away so they can stay safe and alive.
But luckily, there's a backup driver's seat for those of us that like to get more... hands-on.
I'm sitting there wondering this whole time...
Oh, whoa.
...will this thing feel like valet
- at Cheesecake Factory.

No one is getting hands-on.
She doesn't go on city streets.
[motor whirring]
Wow.
I'm in love.
[LITTLE NOBODY] Again... no, no.
That's a million-dollar show car.
The point is to not draw attention.
It's reverse psychology.
Dom will never see it coming.
It's neon orange.
The International Space Station would see it coming.
Go choose anything less conspicuous.
No, no, no.

- Not happening.

This is a gift, a real gift.
I know what you're doing.
[laughs] I like your beard.
You're Blanta.

No, I'm serious.
Put it down right there.
[engine rumbling]
[engine rattling]
What are you doing?
Engine's misfiring.
I gotta check it out.
No, that's not part of the plan, Dom.
Clearly.
But unless you want the engine to seize on the job...
You have five minutes.
I want another visual.
I got an ATM.
I don't like this.
[truck beeping]
I want to see Toretto.
- There are no more cameras.

Punch in on something reflective.
A car mirror, anything.
[WOMAN] Do you know who I am?
It's why I'm here.
Do you know what I'm capable of?
It's why I'm here.
I'll give you until I finish me cuppa.
And I'm fucking thirsty.
I've got limited time, so I won't take up too much of yours.
Oh, no.
No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto.
What more could you possibly want?
To give you something back.
Talk to me.
Something is not right here.
First time I saw my son was behind a bulletproof glass.
When he heard my voice I could see in his eyes he knew I was his father.
When he reached for me,
I couldn't hold him.
It's the worst pain I ever felt.
I know you know exactly how that feels.
Maybe we could change that.
And, now, why do I think you're about to suggest something really dodgy, Mr. Toretto?
It's why I'm here.
[CIPHER] Jesus, punch in on something.
I'm not liking this.

Rhodes, you close?
[RHODES] [over radio] Yeah.
[CIPHER] Go.
The delivery truck's moving.
[no audio]
[engine starts] [tires squeal]
[man speaking indistinctly over radio]
[HOBBS] "Captain Deckard Shaw.
"Distinguished himself by acts of gallantry
"at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.
"His bold actions saved the lives
"of hostages and his teammates.
Recommendation... the Victoria Cross."
The highest honor the British government has ever given... to a traitor.
Something about this whole thing that just doesn't add up to me.
Well, that would be the same kind of funny math that says a DSS agent who has a Silver Star for valor stole an EMP.
Sound familiar, huh?
You want to give me a hand?
- On three?

- One, two, three.

You know what, Twinkle Toes?
In another life, I bet me and you could have done some serious damage.
- Yeah, we could've.

Shame I'm gonna have to bounce your head off the fender when this is all over.
[device whirring]
Ah, well, with all due respect, Captain, when this whole thing is over, we're gonna find a location, and I'm gonna knock your teeth so far down your throat, you're gonna stick a toothbrush right up your ass to brush 'em.
[laughs] [chuckles]
Get me God's Eye.
- [rapid typing]

Good.
Let's find us a Russian.
I spy with my little eye a Minister of Defense.
[sirens wailing]
Upload those coordinates to Dom's nav.
Copy that.
[engine roars] [sirens wailing]
[laughing]
He's in the third car.
[over radio] It's a Guard Class limousine.
[indistinct chatter and laughter]
[sirens wailing]
Where's my team?
- Where's his team?

They're off the grid.
They're probably just bunkered down somewhere.
[DOM] I'm closing in on 'em.
You guys ready?
[CIPHER] One thing I can guarantee, Dom... no one's ready for this.
I want every chip with a zero-day exploit in a two-mile radius around that motorcade now.
There's over a thousand of them.
Hack 'em all.
[engine starts, tires squeal]
It's zombie time.
I'd buckle up if I were you.
- [tires squeal] - [man grunts] [indistinct shouting] [grunting] [horn honking] [tires screeching] [horns honking] [man shouts indistinctly]
[engine starts] [horns honking]
[tires squealing] [engine roars, tires squeak]
[TECH] Safety sensors overridden.
[CIPHER] Thank you.
[quiet chatter] [engine starts] [tires squeak]
[MAN] Whoa, whoa!
[tires screeching]
[tires squealing]
- [man grunts] - [horns honking]
- [grunts, groans]

[tires squealing, horns honking]
Target the motorcade.
[sirens wailing]
[CIPHER] And here they come.
[siren whoops]
Ouch.
[grunts]
[rapid typing]
Police escort down.
Take out the lead and follow cars.
[engine starts] [crowd murmuring] [engine starts]
[engines starting]
- [tires squealing] - [people screaming, gasping] [sirens wailing]
- [tires squealing] - [grunting]
[TECH] Two more down.
[CIPHER] They're still under warranty.
- [tires squealing] - [people screaming]
[man yelling]
[MAN] [over radio] We got an army of cars driving themselves!

I don't care if you send the goddamn Boy Scouts!
Just send them some help!
Now, that's Dom.
- [tires screeching] - [siren wailing]
[sirens wailing, tires squealing]
The motorcade just turned on Seventh.
[CIPHER] Perfect.

[engine starts]
[sirens wailing] [rapid beeping]
[bell dings] [tires screeching]
[frightened grunt] [woman screams]
[gasping]
- [grunts] - [people screaming]
Target immobilized.
You're up, Dom.
[gasping quietly]
[men grunt]
[DOM] Give me the case.
[engines roaring]
[whimpering softly]
Good work, Dom.
Meet you at the pickup.
[tires screech]
[DOM] I think I know where my team's at.
Where?
Right in front of me.
[engines revving] [engine revving]
- [neck cracks] - [engine revving]
This is on you.
Get out of there, Dom.
[RAMSEY] [over radio] Guys, I know why Dom's here.
Police scanners are saying he stole a nuclear football.
[feedback squeals]
It's over, Toretto.
Get your ass out of the car now.
[engine revving]
[HOBBS] So, that's how you want to play this?
Let's play.
[engine revving]
Don't do this, Dom.
[tires screeching]
He's going for it.
- What are you doing?

Damn it!
[woman screams] [people screaming]
[tires screeching]
[TEJ] Now I know what it feels like to be every cop ever chasing us.
I'm gonna get a little closer.

Oh, so you just gonna pit Dom?
Little Nobody has clearly lost his little mind.
[tires screeching]
I'm on him.
Easy.

- [tires screech] - [man shouts]
- [MAN] Look out!

Oh, sh...
- [grunts] - [tires squealing]
I'll take the shortcut.
[people screaming] [horn honking]
[RAMSEY] Look out!

[horn honking]
Big Sexy coming through!
[people screaming]
Not this time, Dom.
[loud metallic ping]
[tires screeching]
[loud metallic ping] [grunts]
Watch the drag, or the line will snap!
[grunting]
Stretch him out.

[grunting]
He's gotta have about 2,000 horsepower in that thing.
Try 3,000.
Try five.
Get out of there.
I'm working on it.
[CIPHER] Stop working on it, and do it.
No, no, no, no.

[grunts]
[yells]
No!

[Roman grunting and yelling] [tires squealing]
[grunting, yelling]
Get that case and run.
[steam hissing] [bystanders murmuring] [grunts]
Move.
[typing]
They thought this was gonna be a street fight.
What are you waiting for, Toretto?
- [two gunshots] - [people screaming]
No!
[MAN] Let's get out of here!
[siren wailing]
[sighs]
Letty, stop!
[panting]
What are you gonna do?
[running footsteps] [gunshot reverberates]
[sirens fade into distance]
I don't know why you're doing this, but I know one thing...
You love me.
And you are not gonna shoot me.
You should have given him the case, 'cause I won't chase you.
Okay.
I will just take it from a dead girl.
[guns cock]
[DOM] You willing to die for it?
Let's go, then.
[gasping]
[HOBBS] Anything?
They're gone.
And DOD confirmed it was a nuclear football.
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.
I don't know what it is, but... but they're building towards something.
Deckard?
[LITTLE NOBODY] He didn't make it.
[grunts]
[CIPHER] [over speaker] I'm disappointed in you, Dom.
When push came to shove, you were gonna let Letty just walk away with the codes.
- You got the codes!

You made the choice to let her go.
And now I have to make one of my own.
[muffled gasping]
They are adorable little things, aren't they?
God, I hope I don't hurt him.
They're just designed to be so cute.
Look, psychotic, I did exactly what you asked me to do.
Don't do this.
This is your doing.
My doing?

[MARCOS] Da-da-da.
Dada.

Please don't hurt him, I'm begging you.
I don't want you to beg.
I want you to learn.
Learn what?

Everyone knows family is the most important thing in your life, so... [muffled sobs] ...I understand why you did what you did.
I really do.
Dada.
[Marcos coos]
But it was the wrong choice.
This is the consequence of that.
[muffled sobs]
No.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

[Elena screams]
- [ELENA] Save your son!

- No!

[shushing]
[Marcos continues crying]
Shh... [sighs]
Can you pull up the footage from the guy in the alley?
Traffic cams.
I got you.
I knew it.
I recognize that guy.
That's Connor Rhodes.
I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother.
He wanted us to get the Nightshade device for him.
He must've been working with that bitch the whole time.
Connor Rhodes.

Mose Jakande.
Warlord who tried to get God's Eye.
Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.
Everything you're feeling right now... this rage, this sense of loss...

It's an adaptive, evolutionary response.
It's a survival instinct wired deep into our brains to ensure continuation of the species.
When early man would visit a watering hole, if they didn't watch their child and it got snatched by a crocodile our brains would create a painful but instructional memory so it would never happen again.
This idea of family that is so core with you, that rules your world, it's a biological lie.
You don't have to accept it.
I don't.
Did you really think you could destroy two of my teams without any repercussions?
I wouldn't have even looked your way if you hadn't done that.
You didn't even know you had a kid.
You can thank me for that and start doing the job I'm asking you to do.
Help you start a war.
Is that what you think I want?
That's so limited.
I didn't take that football to start a war any more than I took your son to start a family.
Taking your son got me the codes.
The codes will get me the nukes, and the nukes will get me what I want today, tomorrow and every day after that.
And what's that?
Accountability.
The second I fire off one of those nukes,
I put the superpowers of this world on notice that when they cross the line,
I'm gonna be there to hold them responsible.
Because the truth is, Dom, to the world out there I am the crocodile at the watering hole.
We've got one last job to do.
I have known one thing about you, Cipher.
Behind those contacts, your eyes are brown.
Beneath that dye, your hair is black.
There was probably beauty inside you once, but somehow you let it all die away.
You're so wrapped up in being a mystery, you don't know who the hell you are anymore.
You're lost... you're alone... and you're scared.
If I were you, I'd kiss my son.
Because, whether you value it or not, all of this... your plane, your security and you... are still on this Earth because of him.
[RAMSEY] The problem we've had with tracking Cipher is there's nothing to trace.
But now we have Rhodes' information.
[TEJ] And we're getting snapshots of his data before it's scrubbed off the Net.
[ROMAN] That look like somebody's bank account, so why don't we just go ahead...
[HOBBS] It's a longitude.
Given the fact that Dom hit a Russian motorcade, safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead and bring up the map.
Good.

Yalta, Poltava...
It's like they just threw letters together.
- Kronyurt...

What are you doing here?
What?

By the way, not so hot.
But there's nothing in Vladovin.
- It's just ice.

Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base where they retrofitted Cold War submarines.
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.
Base was taken over by a terror group of military separatists about a month ago, and the Russians haven't taken it back yet, so there is a little window of opportunity here.
[ROMAN] Russian submarines.

It sounds like, everything we do, our legs gonna be blown off.
It sounds like you still number 11 on the list.
[Tej chuckles]
It sounds like you've changed since your little punk-ass facial hairs done came in.
Like a fake-ass Barry White looking...
[LITTLE NOBODY] Guys, guys.
Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.
That's good thinking, champ, except, unfortunately, the Russian Minister of Defense got himself involved in a little incident on U.S. territory and... two governments aren't talking to each other for a while.
By the time they do, it'll be too late.
So, any other suggestions?
[HOBBS] Yeah.
I got one.
How about we just stop 'em ourselves?
You're talking about a Russian military base.
- Separatist.

It's stopping World War Three.
What's it gonna be, rook?
You gonna close your eyes on this one, too?
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come knocking on your mama's front door?
Or you gonna saddle up, be a man and save the entire goddamn world?
You know, I think I figured it out.
What's that?
Rule number three.
Which is?
There are no rules.
[MR. NOBODY] What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.
[LITTLE NOBODY] Aerial transport leaves in an hour.
Take whatever vehicle you want.
All bets are off.
- All bets are off?

[Mr. Nobody exclaims in Russian]
Letty, I don't like telling you this one bit, but the game's changed.
Before, we were just trying to catch Dom, but now, after all this,
I want you to know, if I have to,
I'm gonna put him down.
Then you might have to take us both down.
[ROMAN] I'm freezing, man.
This ain't for me.
I come from a different kind of lifestyle, brah.
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with it.
I tried to take a piss...
I didn't even recognize myself.
[TEJ] Man, that's entirely too much information.
I'm just saying.
Well, one thing's for sure.
Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a trade, because no one would be this insane to hit this place without a damn army.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
[HOBBS] Speak of the devil.
[CIPHER] All right, Dom, you're one step closer to that family reunion.
400 meters to base.
Prep the EMP.

[rapid beeping]
[explosive whoosh]
Gates are open.

[guards shouting]
EMP is recharging.
- How long?

All right, Dom, you have one pulse left in that EMP.
That sub is heavily insulated.

[beeping]
- Come on.

[explosive whoosh] [alarms buzzing and beeping]
[CIPHER] Yes!
Two birds with one stone.
[TECH] We've got control of the sub.
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the rendezvous.

[whirring]
[TEJ] Damn.
I think Cipher just rebooted that sub to slave its command system.
What the hell is he talking about?
In layman's terms, she just carjacked a submarine.
We can't let it get away.
There's the control room.
If you can get me into that wheelhouse,
I can tap the network and counter-hack Cipher.
Keep it from lowering into the water.
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.
I find the weapons room, and I can pull the launch chip before she can fire any of those nukes.
- That is too crazy.

We'll do both.
Knock, knock.
[soldiers shouting in Russian]
Five vehicles just breached the base.
They just don't give up, do they?
[HOBBS] All right, let's haul ass, team.
Double time, double time.
[soldiers shouting in Russian] [yells in pain]
Letty, let's roll.
[yells in pain]
[LITTLE NOBODY] Go!

[rapid gunfire]
[screams]
[CIPHER] Change of plans, Dom.
I'm sending you new coordinates.
Head there immediately.
I'm done.

I'll tell you when you're done.
Your team is in play.
Now, meet Rhodes and follow my instruction.
I got you covered!

Move, move!
Get out of here!

[panting]
Okay.
How do you like this?
[motor powering down]
[TECH] Remote link has been severed.
[CIPHER] I'll take care of this.
Hi, Ramsey.
[whirring]
[RAMSEY] She's regained control.
Damn it, she's good.
[clanking]
- [gasps] - [gun clicks] [grunting and groaning]
[panting] [grunting and groaning continue]
[yells in pain]
[chanting in Maori] [chanting in Maori] [speaks Russian] [chanting in Maori]
- [Hobbs grunts] - [men groan] [grunting and groaning]
[alarm buzzing]
They're entering the weapons room.
Oh, that's cute.
[alarm continues]
[LITTLE NOBODY] Yo!

Roman, Roman, we gotta find the chip.
Go!
Oh, she's slick.
You're gonna have to do better than that, though.
Okay, now you're starting to piss me off.
[grunting and groaning]
Ramsey, how much time we talking here?
[CIPHER] You're smart... but not smart enough.
[whirring]
She's locked me out.
[grunting and groaning continue]
Tej, I can't stop her.
You're gonna have to pull that chip.
I can't.

The door's not gonna open until you pull the chip.
[ROMAN] Tej, we got no idea what the hell we're looking for.
I got it.
[alarm buzzes, whoops]
What in the hell are you guys doing?
It wasn't me.

It'll be labeled "guidance go."
Guidance go, guidance...
Okay, I got something.
- What?

H-Hakslak... s-slak-lak... smok... belzak... marak...
Do you understand that?
[grunting, panting] [groans]
[man chuckling] [groaning]
[screams] [loud clank]
Wow, nasty.
Hmm.
Quite a show.
We're arming the nuke.
[TEJ] Nuke's going hot.

Roger that.

- Disable that chip, now!

Come on, talk to me.
I don't see shit.

[clanging]
And we have a countdown.
[whirring, clunking] [alarm buzzing]
What the hell is going on, man?
We're about to launch a nuclear missile is what the hell is going on.

[panting]
Countdown.

- Look for a countdown!

The missiles need to activate to launch.
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.
The countdown...
Let's show the world what we've got.
No, no, no, don't press that!
I got it.
Something's wrong.

Get that sub out of there.

[LITTLE NOBODY] Move your ass, Roman!
[panting] [whirring]
- You all right?

What about the missiles?
We got the chip.
No nukes for her.
Hell yeah.
Let's roll.
[tires squealing]
Oh, shit!
[tires screeching]
The other way!
What?
Go the other way!
The ice.

Guys, we got company.
A lot of company.
All right, team, here's the plan.
There's a sea lock at the opening of the bay.
We get there first and close it, we can stop the submarine from escaping into open water and disappearing forever.
[rapid beeping]
[RAMSEY] I've got the location.
It's ten miles southwest.
Ten miles?

[gunfire] [gasping]
No, no, no, no, no!

What's the matter, Roman?
Forgot your snow tires?
[Roman yelling]
You loving that Lambo now?
[ROMAN] Oh, sh...

[yelling]
All right, everyone.
We'll deal with that launch chip later.
Right now I want that sub in deep water where no one can find it.
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.
Copy that.
Why are they shooting at me?

Maybe 'cause you're in an orange Lamborghini.
I don't know.
Shut up, Tej!
[CIPHER] Dom, do you really want to put that car in gear?
[gun cocks]
Do it, huh?
- I didn't think so.

They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.
I should have taken care of this a long time ago.
Rhodes, take his team out.
I'm on it.
[door closes]
Roman, get in front of me.
Okay, y'all want to play rough?
- [buttons beeping]

[beep, rapid gunfire]
Yeah, baby!

Guys, we got snowmobiles on the right.
They're gonna flank us!
No, they ain't.
Oh, shit!
[beeping]
Tej!
Roman, hold tight.

[ROMAN] I don't want to go swimming!
No!
[beep, whirring]
Really, Tej?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Oh, shit!
Roman, grab your door.
[ROMAN] Tej!
[TEJ] Grab the door, Roman!
- [ROMAN] It's so cold!

[ROMAN] Oh, shit!
Whoa!
- Whoo!

What is going on?

Roman, hang on.
Tej!
Get me off of this thing!
Tej!
Come on!
[yells, grunts]
All right.

- [gunfire] - [men groaning]
Number 11, my ass.
[HOBBS] Yo, Shrinkage.
We got a sub to catch.

- [rapid beeping]

Depressurization alert in the cargo hold.
Drop it to 10,000 feet.
I know how much these people mean to you.
So I will let you pick the first target.
I don't pick a target from a mile away.
[chuckling exhale]
I stand face to face and look 'em dead in the eye.
[chuckles]
Okay.
The wife it is.
Nice plane.
I'm going to enjoy having this.
Hey, don't go getting any ideas.
You and planes don't have a good history.
No shit.
Okay...

These assholes ain't gonna kill themselves.
Pull up surveillance right now.
[beep]
Surprise.
You're supposed to be dead.
[sighs]
We have a security breach in the cargo hold.
Take care of it now.
[gasps] [grunts, groans]
Jesus, Mum.
You're supposed to avoid the nerves.
Oh, shut up.

[men groaning]
Get to the pilot.

- Wait for my signal.

Did Toretto hold up his end of the deal?
[MRS. SHAW] He gave us this little thing here.
No, no, no, no.
Don't touch.
You can track Cipher with this, but you can't do this on your own.
It's gotta be two of you.
Fine.

No, you're gonna take your brother.
- No.

[grunting and groaning]
Toretto knows where he is.
He's got this thing.

It's like... it's called the Devil's Bumhole or something.
- It's called the God's Eye.

There's no way I'm using Owen, all right?
He's a lost cause.
He's your brother, Decks.
He's my son.
He's our family.
[crying] And our family don't die in bloody cages.
How can you talk like that about Owen?
I can't believe you.
You've gone and upset me.
You've really upset your mother.
Call yourself a brother?
- Look, look, come here.

Mum.

Every time.
[gun cocks]
- [radio beeps]

- [beep]

Go.
I'm in.
[cell phone buzzing]
[DECKARD] I've got the package, Toretto.
All 12 pounds of him.
Yeah!
Dada.

- [both grunt] - [bullet ricochets] [car door closes, footsteps approaching]
You made me miss my shot.
What you think you're doing?
Looking at you dead in the eye.
[grunting and groaning]
[choking] [yells]
[groaning, choking] [yelling]
That was for Elena.
- [radio beeping]

[DOM] He's no longer with us.
Rhodes picked the wrong target.
Congratulations, Dom.
You just killed your son.
You're wrong.

And you just took your foot off the tiger's neck.
All right, governor, it's gonna get noisy.
- This is for your ears.

[Deckard makes whooshing sound]
["The Chipmunk Song, Christmas Don't Be Late" plays]
Good?
[coos]
Let's go.
No.

Do not let him get off this plane.
[LITTLE NOBODY] We got another problem.
That truck's got enough missiles to take us all out.
Then don't give 'em a target.
Everybody, get in front of us, line up,
- and we'll take the hit.

I need to switch cars right now.
- Roman, here comes the bad part.

[ROMAN] Whoa!
Whoo!
Hang in there, guys.

[ROMAN] It's easy for you to say when your ass ain't on fire.
["The Chipmunk Song, Christmas Don't Be Late" continues]
All right, little man.
This might be a little scary, but it's gonna be a lot of fun.
Ready?
[rapid beeping] [grunting and groaning]
[indistinct shouting]
How's the music?

[coos] [men groaning]
[whirring] [beeping]
They're locking on.
Sorry, guys, I got no tricks left.
What do we do now?
[TEJ] We start praying.
[beep, weapon blasting]
Hell yeah!
There's Dom.
What, is this guy on our side now?
Who the hell cares?

Good to be riding with you again, man.
Toretto just cleared the way for them.
- Someone, give me something.

Then launch them!
Shit.
Take the wheel.
I ain't taking shit!
[HOBBS] Take the wheel!
- [grunts]

[grunting]
- This is crazy!

- Left and back!

Turn the goddamn wheel to the left really quickly.
[grunts]
Oh, got it.
Boom, baby.
[men groaning]
- [gunfire] - [men groaning]
Going for a ride.
[man groaning]
Back in a sec.
[grunting and groaning]
[bone cracks] [groaning]
Where's that smile?
- [coos]

[groans]
You were gonna shoot a baby?
You sick bastard.
You're not gonna want to see this.

Is that you or him?
[grunts] [sniffs]
Him.

The torpedoes missed.
They're gonna reach the lock before the sub does.
The hell they are.
Get ready for this.
Oh, shit!
We're gonna need a bigger truck.
[laughing]
It's right under us.

[both grunt]
[gasping]
I'm not going back in that water!
Get us out of here!
Why are you always yelling?
- This bitch is crazy.

[gasps] [yells]
Yeah, that's not good.
That's not good.
Please tell me there's nothing to worry about.
Relax.

[gasps]
- [grunts] - [sighs] [laughs]
That's my girl.
The sub's too close.

We're just gonna let it get away?
Not if I know Dom.
You lose, Dom.
I destroyed two of your teams,
I killed your redheaded boyfriend, and I put two killers on your untraceable plane.
You lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon.
Now guess who I'm coming for.
Put a heat-seeker on him now.
Now!
Fire!
That's a goddamn heat-seeker coming at us!
Peel off!

[whirring]
All right.
Come and get it.
[beeping]
[beeping]
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no.
- Dive!

This...
This is for my son.
[explosive whoosh]
[gasps quietly]
Dom!
[Hobbs groans]
[debris clattering, glass shattering]
[computer beeping]
- [two gunshots] - [man groans]
You're out of bullets, Deckard.
Not like I'm gonna need a gun to take care of you.
How did you find me?
[DOM] You want to see the old Dom?
- [beeping]

Resourceful.
You have a lot to answer for, Cipher.
What you put my family through.
My mother.
I'm gonna make sure that never happens again.
To anyone.
There is only one flaw in your plan.
What's that?
Only one of us has a parachute.
[rapid beeping]
[grunting] [frustrated grunt]
[cooing happily]
Told you this would be fun.
[coos]
Time to land, boys.
You know I never left you, Letty.
I know.
And you know I never will.
I know.
[chuckling]
I have so much to tell you.
Yeah, you do.
And you can start with that bitch.
[ROMAN] Now, that's Dominic Toretto.
Hey, Dom.
I'm just throwing it out there.
We need to get up out of here 'cause there's all kind of nuclearism
- happening under this ice.

Without the trigger chips, those nukes are harmless.
Okay, so we good, then.
Let me go and get my young selfie levels up.
You realize this is classified, right?
Not today.
- [camera clicks]

[ROMAN] All right, can we get up out of here now?
I'm freezing.

♪ Spent too much time getting ready for this ♪
♪ These days it seems like I just can't miss ♪
♪ And I must confess... ♪
It's okay.
Don't worry.
He's gonna be here soon.
[ROMAN] I get it.

Computer hacks, God's Eye, geeks, nerd, the...

But we got a lot in common, too, right?
- Like what?

We steal the show.
Me and you, hip to hip, is a problem.

I'm asking a real question right now.
Is it gonna be Revenge of the Nerds...
- [Ramsey chuckles] - [ROMAN] Or...
The Dark Knight?

To be honest, I like both of you.
[ROMAN] Yeah, baby.

[TEJ] All right, all right, baby...
[Tej and Roman muttering indistinctly]
But just before we get into all of that, let me ask you one question.
You can ask me anything.
Anything.
What's my last name?
When you guys figure it out, then...
- I guess you can let me know.

That's... that's all that really matters.
- [ROMAN] Jones.

- Right?

- [LETTY] Hey.

I wanted to thank you.
No need.
Cipher is still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens, but matter of time before we find her, thanks to you guys.
So, I got you a party favor.
- [HOBBS] This can't be good.

[MR. NOBODY] Your record's been cleared.
Full reinstatement.

That is, if you want it.
- If I want.

[laughs]
You know, after 16 years,
I figure it's time for a little break.
Wow.
Daddy's staying home.
[laughs]
Mmm... mwah.
Nobody.
Keep in touch.
Ah, hang on a second.
This could be interesting.
[sighs] What made you think I'd do it?
Brotherhood.
I saw that look you gave Cipher.
Knew you wanted revenge.
Glad I did it.
Can't believe you went to see my mother.
[both chuckle]
Hey.
Hey, you know my son is only American muscle.
Hey, look, had to give him something.
Look how I tested the little guy.
[HOBBS] Come on, Roman.
Get to cooking, buddy.
We all love you.

All this fuss over you.
[Marcos coos]
Yes.
Elena, I promise to keep our son safe.
And now he always will be.
I want to introduce you to the most important person in my universe.
One who never gave up on me.
He's beautiful.
[DOM] You've heard me say that you never turn your back on family.
And I want to thank you all for never turning your back on me.
You want to meet them?
All right.
Everyone...
- meet Brian.

- [ROMAN] Oh, man.

[coos]
[TEJ] I love it.
- [HOBBS] Go, Brian.

[ROMAN] Welcome to the family, Brian.
Okay, I guess it's my turn to say grace.
