Hurry up!

Dad, I don't want to go to church.
Too bad.

[bell tolls] [groans] I hate going to temple.
I don't feel good.

I don't want to go to processing to have my thetans cleared.
[woman murmurs]
Here you go.
Whoa, this is good.

It's bacon.
You've never had this before?
Nope.
[phone rings] [beep] [woman] Hello?
Yeah, he's right here.
Dev, your mom's on the phone.
Hi, Mom.
[Nisha] I thought you were coming home.

I'm eating bacon.
Dev...
Bacon is pork.

We are not allowed to eat pork.
I can't eat it?

Po-da.

Hurry up and come home.
Okay.

[Ramesh] Salaam alaikum, brother.
Why you saying "salaam alaikum"?
Salil Uncle and Sabina Auntie are religious.
Say you are fasting for Ramadan.
Don't order any pork.
Seriously?

Just play along, man.
You're an actor, or you were an actor.
I don't know what you do now.
All right, let's go.
[Ramesh] All right.
Ah.
Hey, how's it going?
As-salaam alaikum, Dev.
Dev, it is so good to see you, beedu.
Good to see you too.

[Sabina] Wonderful.
So, Dev, how was the fasting today?
Um, it was good.
You know, I didn't eat anything from sunrise to sunset, so I'd say solid fast.
And it must be very difficult to fast with all those tasty cupcakes at work.
Mm.
Did you know Hakeem Olajuwon fasted during the NBA Finals?
Wow.

Yeah, I've heard it before.
Sorry to interrupt, folks.
I wanted to let you know that spectacular pork dish I mentioned, we're down to our last one if you'd like to order it.
No, we don't eat pork.
[waiter] Okay, no problem.
Um, I'll be right back to take your order.
[Dev] Great.
Navid, you're looking good, man.
Do you ever think about modeling?
Like fashion modeling?
[Ramesh] You are a handsome guy.
We need more Indian models.
More?

Inshallah, Navid will be the first one.
Tell Dev to make some photos.
We'll make a portfolio and do some posing like this.
One... two... and three.
[Dev] Wow.
So, Navid, we'll schedule that shoot soon.
-Sounds good.

Auntie, Uncle, what are you guys doing in town?
Your uncle got us tickets to see the Timberwolves play the Knicks at MSG for our anniversary.
Ah, it's gonna be sensational.
And the timing has worked out so that we can say the Eid prayer with your parents.
Oh.
And, Dev, will you be joining us?
I don't know.

He is coming.
Okay, all right, I guess I'm coming.
Navid, you have good hair.
You can do some commercial for shampoo.
What would the poses look like for that?
For a sexy hair, like this.
Wow.

We'll save it for the shoot.
I don't know.

-For sexy hair...

You got it.
-Dev, how was your trip to Italy?

You must come with us to hajj in Mecca next year.
Your father says you're quite pious.
Uh, you know, I try. [chuckles]
Dev says prayer five times a day, every day.
Do you like this mosque we're going to this weekend?
Um... yeah.
It's a really good mosque.
They have really good AC.
Always a good temperature for the prayer.
And, um, the carpet's very soft, too.
It's one of my-- one of my top five mosques in-- in the world.
How was dinner?
How's my boy Ramesh?

They're good.
Got some religious relatives in town, so I had to put on a little bit of a show.
Is your family religious, super into Hindu stuff?
They're not super religious, but they did make me go to temple as a kid.
I'd be decked out in a Sean John velour suit like... ♪ Jaya Jagadisa Hare ♪ [chuckles]
[Tanvi] They make you go to mosque as a kid?
[Dev] Yeah, we'd go for the big holidays.
I remember when my mom took me for the first time.
I thought I was gonna see that Jim Carrey movie The Mask, then we end up at the mosque.
Not exactly the same.
Ugh, they're still doing it.
My mom wants me to go to this Eid prayer.
Can I bail?
Dude, just go.
Why?
Because you got to compromise.
I mean, just throw them a bone every now and then.
Remember when Q and I got married?
My parents wanted us to have some four-hour Hindu ceremony with some rando priest from Queens.
We just said, "Fine," but, in return, we played 100% rap at the reception, explicit versions.
Oh, I remember, Tanvi.
It was pretty intense when you guys came out to "Fuck That Shit" by Three 6 Mafia.
Hey, man, that's our song.
[indistinct chatter] [alternative rock music playing over speakers]
Navid, you're jacked, man.

Not that much.

Mostly chest and arms?
Surprisingly, I do mostly back.
-Why back?

It's all about the frame.
How's my frame?
Dude... [laughs]
You're a twig.
[clicks tongue] Shut up.
So, uh, what's good to get here?
Ooh, that Cubano's awesome.
[clicks tongue] It's got pork in it, though.
You eat pork?
Yeah, come on, you know I'm not religious.
-Do you eat pork in front of your parents?

What about you?

Not really.
You must be curious, though, right?
Oh, my God.
This is so good.
[Dev] Right?
Pork is amazing.
It's just like chicken but juicier.
Thanks for convincing me not to fast today.
All right, so be honest.
How religious are you?
You really go to prayer and stuff?
I do the Friday prayer here and there.
I believe in God.

I give to charity.
I try not to be too materialistic.
But there's definitely parts I just can't keep up with.
Like what?
You got to swear you won't tell anyone.
I started drinking.
What?

No way.

Hey, I get it.

Got to keep up that facade.
Not like white kids telling their parents about fucking.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Have fun with your portobello and hummus.
How can you think Towns is better than Porzingis?
Porzingis can shoot the three.
Porzingis is too skinny.
He can't bang in the post like Towns.
Get this guy a protein shake, then we'll talk.
You know who is good at basketball?
Michael Jordan.
[laughter]
Yeah, Ramesh, he's good.
Okay, where shall we have dinner to celebrate Eid?
How about some nice seafood?
My friend Dr. Ibrahim said there's a very nice Thai restaurant we should try.
Hmm, Thai food.
It's too spicy.
Ramesh.

We can go there.
What's going on, guys?
Salaam alaikum, beedu.
Alaikum salaam.
Uh, I think I'm gonna head out, but have fun at the game, guys.
Stay for prayer.
Uhh, I think I'll just catch my prayer at home.
But have a good time.

[all chattering]
[Ramesh] So I've been going to...
-[Navid] Dude.

Check this out.
It's Hog Wild Weekend at Smorgasburg tomorrow.
What's Hog Wild Weekend?
It's this big food festival that has some of the best barbecue from all over the country.
My friend Curtis went last year, and he said it's amazing.
Let's skip prayer and go tomorrow.
You want to skip Eid prayer and go to a barbecue festival?
That's bad, even for me.
Come on.

Let me see this.
Oh, shit, Tickler's is in the mix.
I went once in Nashville.
It was ridic.
All right, how do we skip the prayer?
Um...
Let's say we got food poisoning and that we'll do prayer from home.
-How do we both get food poisoning?

We can say we got halal cart, and then we both got sick.
Ooh, that's good.
Come on.

[softly] Yeah.

How are you still eating?

Dude, this sausage looks so good.
I just got to have a bite.
Oh, shit, Denise in the cut.
-What up, boo?

Man, you know I fuck with ribs.
Have y'all tried that spot from Kansas City yet?
Man, them honey wings is bonk.
Denise, this is my cousin Navid.

-What up, man?

Oh, shit, it's your dad.

Stay down.
Oh.
Sorry.

Man, I almost had a heart attack.
I thought it was him.
Why the fuck were we just hiding behind that damn tree?
His dad doesn't know that we eat pork.
It's against our religion.
Wait, aren't y'all two grown-ass men?
Yeah!

[Denise] Okay, this is crazy.
Now, I got some religious relatives that's not into the whole lesbian thing, but I ain't got to hide who I am.
Not that eating pork is on the same level of scrutiny as being gay, but you know what I'm saying.
Yeah.

We've been friends since we was kids.

Oh, yeah.
You do do that.
Navid raja, are you feeling okay?
Yeah, I feel a lot better after resting now.
Um, how was the prayer?

Your father's cell phone went off in the middle of the second rakat.
[Dev clicks tongue]
I set a reminder to go to the prayer.
[chuckles] I set the wrong time. [laughs] [both speaking Tamil]
All right, guys, uh, we ready to order?
[Sabina] Uh, yes.
We'll have the mango salad, uh, crab fried rice, and a veggie green curry-- medium spicy.
Navid, do you want something else?
No, I'm not that hungry.
[waiter] And for you guys?
Um, is there any specialties of the kitchen?
The crispy pork with Chinese broccoli is probably our most popular dish.
It's fantastic.
We don't eat pork.
[sighs]
You know what?

And I'll have that.

What-

He's just joking.
Uh, I'm actually not joking.
I'm not that religious, and, uh...
I eat pork.
But it's okay 'cause I'm a good person.
And I'm 33 years old, and I can make those decisions, I can eat what I want, and I-I want to eat the crispy pork with the broccoli.
Ow!

If you are going to order that, we are leaving.
You're gonna leave?
Yes, we are.
What is arugula?
Ramesh, we are getting out of here.
Goodie-goodie!

I like mahi-mahi.
[sighs]
[Nisha] I can't believe you did this.
[Ramesh] Uncle and Auntie were very offended.
Well, I'm sorry they're offended.
But you know what?

And I don't think it's right to pretend to be.
What do you mean you are not religious?
[Dev] It's just not for me.
What's not for you?
Um, well, there's definitely issues.
What about all the stuff with women?
What is this, Fox News?
Why am I under attack?
[Nisha] Po-da.
You know we don't believe that.
Some people have bad interpretations.
Yeah, and, you know, you guys have your interpretations, right?
You eat non-halal.
You used to smoke cigarettes.
You don't wear the hijab.
Why can't I have my interpretation where I'm just nice and I eat pork?
It's not funny.
[Dev] Look, I get it.
For you guys, religion has this cultural value.
It's not like that for me.
It's people calling me terrorist and getting pulled out of airport security lines.
That's because you lost your passport three times.
I lost it twice.
-[Nisha] No, three times.

I don't want to talk about this anymore.
I am really disappointed in you.
I'm going to bed.
We could have gone to the seafood place!
None of this would have had happened.
Really?
That's your takeaway after all this?
That we should've gone to the seafood place?
Yep!
Good night.
[knock at door]
-[Dev] Hey.

-[Ramesh] Whassup?

It's going great.
I did a few colonoscopies,
ERCPs.
I read a little Harry Potter.
The new one is very good.
Mm.

So what's up?

Uh, I don't know.
This iPad is not working.
I took it to the Apple Store to see the Genius.
He couldn't even figure it out.
Did you really go to the Apple Store?
No, the line is too big.
All right, let's see.
So what's wrong with it?
It is very dark.
I think it's dying.
[clicks tongue]
Your brightness isn't up.
Wonderful!

-I'll see you later.

Sit down.
What's going on?
I tried to call Ma today.

She's really mad at you.
She's so mad at you, she even got mad at me.
I asked her to heat up a pizza.
She said, "Go and do it yourself!"
I got scared.
[sighs]
It's been two weeks.
Isn't this a bit much for just eating pork?
It's not about eating pork.
It's not about the religion.
It's about you ignoring us, not realizing who you are.
[sighs] What do you mean?
You see, our parents raised us to be a good Muslim.
When you went out to school, we gave you a Qur'an.
I don't think you ever read it.
When you act like this, we feel like we failed you.
You know that's not true.
[Ramesh] Look, man, you can drink.
You can eat pork.
You can smoke Mary Jane.
That's your business.
But when you do it in front of Mom, it hurts her feelings.
[exhales deeply] I get it.
All right, I have to go and watch some Super Singer.
What's Super Singer?
Super Singer is the Indian version of The Voice.
Only Indian people sings, no whites.
[Nisha] "Dev, when I went to school, my mother gave me a Qur'an, and I want to do the same for you.
If you are confused, scared or worried, read this, and maybe you will find some knowledge.
Love, Ma."
