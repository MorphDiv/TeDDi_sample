(The day of the Wolha-dong murder incident 01:20am)
She must have gone to her dad's room again.
That's strange.

Who are you?
Jeong Woo.
Honey.

Jeong Woo.
He won't be able to wake up for a while.
Who are you guys?
You're hurting my feelings.
How could you not know the person... your husband is dying to catch?
Then you're...
That's right.
Seon Ho died instead of me.
Unfortunately,
Prosecutor Park is the only one... that doesn't believe it.
Where's Ha Yeon?

Ha Yeon... is all right.

Don't kill her.

Apparently, a press conference is scheduled for tomorrow morning.
It's a shame it'll be canceled now.
I'll make sure to persuade my husband.
Please don't kill him.
- Prosecutor Park won't die.

That's because... he's going to become the culprit that murdered you.
Honey.

That was close.
Prosecutor Park is... left-handed, right?
Let's get to it.
Yes.
Get up, Prosecutor Park.
Ji Soo.
Ji Soo.
Ji Soo.
Ji Soo.
Ji Soo.
Ji Soo.
Ji Soo, Ji Soo.
Jeong Woo.
Wait.

Honey.
Ha Yeon is... missing.
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon!
Ji Soo.
Ji Soo.

Ji Soo.
Ji Soo, no.
Open your eyes.
Please.

Please, please.
Please, Ji Soo!
Prosecutor Park.
Cha Min Ho.
What have you done?
You killed her.
You killed her.
It's because of you.
It's because... you were suspicious of me.
Cha Min Ho.
Why on earth did you follow me around?
Why did you bother me?

Cha Min Ho is dead.
He's dead.
I said he's dead.

How far will you take this?
You should have killed me instead.
Oh, right.
If I did that, my brother won't be dead.
- Cha Min Ho!

You have... made me go crazy.
And finally, you've killed your wife.
Ji Soo.
Where is...
Ha Yeon?
If I die,
Ha Yeon dies, too.
You crazy jerk!
Let us think... only about Ha Yeon now.
If you want her to live, you can become the criminal.
Do you understand?
Prosecutor Park.
- You jerk.

I stabbed her with my left hand.
Just for you.
(Innocent Defendant)
(Episode 9)
Cha Min Ho, it was you.
It was you, Cha Min Ho.
Vice President Cha Min Ho of Chamyung Group became the suspect... for the villa murder incident of last month.
I will make sure...
I find the evidence.
His fingerprints are 99.99 percent match to that of Cha Seon Ho.
Cha Min Ho!
Yes.
I am Cha Min Ho.
Darn it.
Ha Yeon.
You are probably afraid I'll get my memory back.
You'll try to kill me if you know I gained it back.
Things won't go your way.
I will make the transfer.
I have to hold out.
- Are you okay?

My goodness.

I think the dinner was spoiled.
Right?
My stomach feels weird, too.
It began to hurt a little.
Wait, Inmate 3866.
You haven't had dinner.
Right?
Didn't I eat?
Miryang.
What did I eat today?
You had some smoked chicken in a hurry.
Right.
I guess that went wrong.
I almost died.
What did you eat?
Hey, Moongchi.
It's his first day.

Hey, answer me.
Did you smile?
Did you just smile?
My gosh.

Darn you.
My goodness.

You two, stop it.
Our new guy is... very odd.
Miryang.
Should we start the ritual?
It's late.

- Right?

Let him sleep tonight.
Sure.

Take a look.
What's up with you?

I came all the way here.
You really don't remember?
Hey, new guy.

Soo Young...
Your blood is on the knife... you killed Ji Soo with.
I hid it.
You just wait.

Roll call.
Hey, new guy.

Say it concisely and powerfully.
If you don't do it well, you will be executed, okay?
He's ignoring me again.
Hey.

Has any one of you heard him speak?
His mouth has been glued.
- Roll call!

- One.

- Three.

- Five.

He can talk.
Hey, you.

After you get them, you have to put them between the blankets.
This is how they won't get cold.
We can make coffee and cook ramyeon with them.
We will use these to wash ourselves.

Hey, you!
Watch and learn.

This is your job now.
I won't repeat myself.
Rockfish.

You made Seong Kyu cry when he first came here.
I'll let you off just for today.
Why did you get Seong Kyu involved?
Gosh.

After vomiting everything last night, I have no energy.
Miryang.

Well.

- Inmate 3866.

Hey!

- What is it now?

He did what?
- I didn't know.

Do you think I believe you?
You really didn't know we were to share them among six of us?
I thoroughly explained it to you.
- Have you gone deaf?

- Moongchi.

- Take care of him.

I don't care if I end up as a death row inmate.
- You, jerk.

Look at this.
(Cha Seon Ho, President of Chamyung Group)
You should have told us earlier.
Goodness.

You are quite rich.
Even his number is quite unusual.
He has 3 numbers of 7.
His skin is fair.

From now on, you can make yourself at home.
Why don't you lie down?
Inside or outside, whoever has the most money wins.

Whoever has money wins?

All you did was buy fried chickens.
You should've done more than buying fried chickens.
Raise your hand if you agree to change the boss of this cell.
By the way, why didn't they put you... in a prison where all the rich inmates go?
I had someone I needed to meet.
Inmate 3866, don't you know how to thank someone?
He bought us brand new sleeping bags, underwear, and shoes.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
Since we have a new inmate, why don't we have some time to introduce ourselves?
- Why don't you make hot chocolate?

Gosh.

Seong Kyu made the best hot chocolate, don't you agree?
Anyhow, I wonder how his sister's surgery went.
Inmate 3866, didn't Seong Kyu visit you?
What did he say?
According to Seong Kyu, the surgery went well.
He was glad to be there to take care of his sister.
He came to thank me.
I see.
If you didn't help him with his trial, he wouldn't have been there to take care of her.
He said he would visit again.
You're up, Moongchi.
As you all know,
I was in finance.
Look at you.

Shut it.
Anyway, I was sentenced to one year.
Now I have less than two weeks.
You sigh more than usual although you have less than two weeks left.
Don't you remember the first day you came in here?
Hello.

You can call me Moongchi.
I am Moongchi.

Thank you.
You were so cheerful.

He's right.

You were like a dog let out in the snow.
Don't bring my mother into this.
You don't even know how I feel.
- No good will come of this.

- Tell us.

No.

- You got it wrong.

How can it be an unlawful entry?
When I got home, the children were by themselves.

I gave money for school supplies.

- Goodness.

- Get inside.

Be quiet.
Detectives, this isn't right.
We will start drawing for the 693rd lottery.
Hey, it's starting.
- Here it goes.

- It's 34.

- Did you get it?

- Let it be 35.

- Please.

Hold on.
Hey.

Wait.

- Be quiet.

Father.

Forgive your terrible son.

I can't stand it.
Father!
However, the judge gave me one year in prison.
I needed him to deduct three days.
I only needed three days.

What is he mumbling about?
- If only he deducted three days...

- It's nothing.

All right.

Why is his name tag red?
He's on death row.
I wasn't aware.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
What was his legal team doing?
How can he be apprehended for such a trivial incident?
- I am sorry.

Chairman.

- Is this true?

Tell Yeon Hee to come to see me.
(Jennifer Lee)
(Mr. Kim)
Yes.
You wanted to see me.
Go turn yourself in immediately!
Seon Ho should lead Chamyung Group.
He doesn't deserve to be insulted just because of you.
I assisted in restoring your sinking family.
Is this how you return my favor?
Restoring my family?
Do you think I don't know?
You are the one who made my family go down.
What did you say?
Are you out of your mind?
If it weren't for you, our family and I wouldn't have any trouble.
If you didn't split us up, nothing would have happened.
How dare you say such a thing?
What should I tell the police?
Do you want me to tell them... that your son... killed his older brother and Jennifer Lee?
What?
What does that mean?
Are you saying you didn't know that?
All you care about is Chamyung Group.
That's why you pretended not to know... that Min Ho killed his brother.
You are the one who made Min Ho do such things!
What are you doing?
Come have a seat.
Yes.
You must have been shocked.
You know Seon Ho wouldn't do an irresponsible thing like that.
I'm sorry.
He will come out soon.
Don't worry about him.
Eun Soo... must not know anything about this.
Yes, Father.
Chairman, Mrs. Myung is missing.
What?
She went missing?
What do you mean?
It's... a bit cloudy today.
I bet you are having a hard time... as you lost your memory.
I once went through the same experience myself.
I understand how you feel.
My younger brother died.
I see.
Prosecutor Park Jeong Woo.
Did you really lose your memory?
I'm not sure.
Gosh, I'm disappointed.
I thought we were really close.
Were we?
By any chance, are you pretending not to know me?
Is there any reason why I should do so?
I just don't remember anything.
I see.
Never mind.
Are you leaving alone?
You can't be transferred leaving me all alone here.
What?

Is he being transferred?
Do you think he heard that?
I don't know.
Is that him?
Is he the man you were after?
That's right.
I needed you in order to catch him.
So you're saying,
I'm here because of him.
That jerk!
Now is not the time yet.
Promise me this.
If you manage to break prison, you will release me.
Okay.
He's staying in the same cell with Inmate 3866.
That's very interesting.
- What about Lee Seong Kyu?

Why is it so hard to find him?
What about Park Jeong Woo?
Do you want me to find someone to take care of it?
He doesn't remember me anyway.
It won't be fun if I kill him just now.
But right after the incident, you spared his life when he lost his memory.
It saved his life.
But it's different this time.
I will make him recall me.
Geum Ja.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't tell you that... as you were sick.
What should I do?
Poor Seon Ho.

Did you know about it?
It's water under the bridge now.
How can you say that?

How can you...
Min Ho is the one who died.
Keep that in mind.
What about Min Ho?
I can't lose two sons at once.
You killed... my two sons.
It's Cha Min Ho whom you loved so much.
He's the one who killed Seon Ho.
He chose to become Seon Ho.
What am I supposed to do?
If you don't want to lose Seon Ho, make sure to stay quiet.
Don't go berserk and make a fuss.
Honey, where is Min Ho?
I want to see Min Ho.
You've regained much of your lost memory like these puzzles.
It's not that only attorneys have attorney-client confidentiality.
I know.
If your whole memory returns,
you will lose it again.
To protect yourself... from those painful memories.
That's why you've repeatedly... lost your memory for the past five months.
You will soon... lose your memory again.
I'll lose my memory again soon.
Is there a way to stop that?
You said you had a dream before you lost your memory.
Yes.
My wife and daughter... were trying to wake me up in the dream.
Daddy, wake up.
Wake up, Jeong Woo.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Wake up, honey.
You dream of the moment you want to return the most.
Right.
Right before you lose your memory.
There might be an answer in that dream.
There's an answer... in the dream?
- It's on!

I'm like TT
Just like TT
You don't know how I feel
- You're so mean, you're so mean

What?

You're so mean!
I told you to turn on the TV on time.
Look.

He looks like Seong Kyu, right?
- He does.

Seong Kyu is a hundred times better than him.
- Turn it off.

Rockfish, I'm hungry.

Here we go.
- Thanks.

These are yours.
Are you okay?

Yes.

Did you meet her again?
This doesn't suit you.
His verdict wasn't great.

Our rich guy did not even introduce himself.
Can you do anything?
- Me?

But things do get quite boring in here.
We don't want to hear about your crime.
If you feel confident, sing for us.
Then should I do it?
He's wild.

I used to be involved in theater.
- Theater?

I just remembered a part of a play.
Then show us.

- Give him a hand.

Do it.
I will perform a bit, then.
Don't kill her.
Please don't kill her.
What's this play called?
I'll make sure to persuade my husband.
Please don't kill my husband, please.
Your husband... won't die.
That's because... he's going to become the culprit that murdered you.
What kind of a jerk is this guy?
Is that so?
- Hey.

I'll kill you.

I will kill you, jerk.
- Let go of him!

- Yes, this is it.

- You're very strong.

- Take him apart.

- My goodness.

Hey, you are creating a scene for the officers and us.

- Calm down.

Hey, are you okay, rich guy?
Inmate 3866!

I will kill him!
Calm down.
Yes.
You do remember me.
You ate it.
- You ate his bread.

You gave him the wrong one.
Give me my bread!
My bread!

Give me my bread.
Give me my bread.

- Give it to me, you jerk.

- Here it is.

My bread.

Inmate 3866 got angry because of that bread.
He has completely adapted in here.
This is a place where people will murder someone... over just a bread.
My bread!

Darn it.
Park Jeong Woo, you idiot.
Will you keep this up?
(Lee Seong Kyu)
Ha Yeon.
Where on earth are you?
Are you two together?
What are you up to?
Take a break and have some of this.
Here.
Did you meet that guy with pretty eyes?
Hey, eat up.
Are these your cases?
- Yes.

- That's a lot, right?

Aunt.
You really look like an attorney now.
- When wasn't I one?

- Good luck.

Sure.
(He is currently in Woljeong Prison.)
Woljeong Prison?
Ha Yeon.
- Say, "Dad, wake up."

Let's wake him up.
- Honey, I love you.

I love you.
You dream of the moment you want to return to.
The answer may be in that dream.
You will soon lose your memory again.
No.
Have some eggs.
- Is it good?

My mom often made eggs for me, too.
I see.
Eat up.
You eat so well.
Congratulations for receiving the Attorney General Award.
Thank you.
Don't thank me.

- Let's leave together today.

Deputy Prosecutor.
- What about President Cha?

- Pardon?

When a rich guy causes a problem, people tend to get suspicious.
No one will talk if we conduct a custody investigation.
But go easy on him.
Jeong Woo.
I stopped by to ask you something after I met another client.
I remembered everything.
- What?

- Who is it?

- He's in my cell right now.

His current name is Cha Seon Ho.

Why?

He is the client...
I just met.
Hello, I'm Seo Eun Hye, an attorney.
- Are you President Cha Seon Ho?

Why did you choose me instead of famous law firms?
I do try my best, though.
- Thank you for your work.

He probably chose you because of me.
- What do I do?

You know nothing about my memory and that you know he's Cha Min Ho.
I'm going to focus on transferring.
I'm not sure... if breaking out is the right choice.
When I find Ha Yeon, I will turn myself in.
Then I will receive my retrial.
If I am found innocent, I won't be charged for breaking out.
Jeong Woo, take a look at this.
All of the evidence say that you are the culprit, but I was sure I'll find something, and I found this.
Two of the knives are gone.

She said they were there before.
If one was possibly chosen as evidence, where could the other one be?
I hid it.
- What?

I hid it.
That knife has Cha Min Ho's blood on it.
Then you mean...
It'll be crucial evidence at the retrial.
I hid the analysis results... that'll reveal Cha Min Ho's identity with the knife.
Where are they?
First,
I'm going to focus on transferring to another prison.
Ha Yeon.
Please find Ha Yeon for me.
All right, Jeong Woo.
Be careful.
Watch out for Cha Min Ho.
No, Cha Seon Ho.
Do they really not know... or are they acting stupid?
This award certificate is for Prosecutor Kang Jun Hyuk.
He has raised the status of and brought honor to our office.
We give this award to him for his outstanding service... as a prosecutor that truly works for the community.
Public Prosecutor General Hwang hereby gives the award.
Congratulations, Jun Hyuk.
Cheers.
Prosecutor Kang.
Yes, sir.
General.
- Receive a glass from the General.

Here you go.
I was impressed by your trial.
- I hear you're going to the UN.

Enjoy the opportunity.
I'll see you when you get back.
It's an honor, sir.
Jun Hyuk.

Mother.
Have you eaten dinner?
Yes, Mother.
How are your knees?

I'm all right now.
Why did you call?
I received an award today.
An award?

It was given by the Prosecutor General.
He also gave me a glass of liquor himself.
Goodness.
I'm so proud of you.
My son is the best.
What's Father doing?
He went out to buy liquor again.
He'll be back soon.
I'll tell him to call you when he gets back.
Tell him to cut down on drinking.
You two should come visit me when I go to the US.
You can go sightseeing.
Just hearing you say that is more than enough.
- Mother.

Go home and get some rest.
Mother.
Yes, Father.
Uncle.
Hello?
Uncle Jun Hyuk.
It's me, Ha Yeon.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
(Whoever finds this notebook, please contact the above.)
Ha Yeon.

My dad... really went to catch the bad guys, right?
- What?

Neither is Mom.
Dad... didn't do that to Mom, right?
What are you talking about?
I saw it at the Catholic church.
What I saw on television was a lie, right?
What you told me is the truth, right?
You said if I behaved,
Mom and Dad would come to get me.
Trust me.
The television was lying.

I'm telling you the truth, so don't cry, Ha Yeon.
Stop crying.
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon.
How could Ha Yeon be alive?
Just one day.
If only she had called a day earlier.
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon.
- I'm back.

(3 missed calls)
Who could this be?
(Crime Report Call Center)
You promised me you'd save her.
The operation went well, but you sister was too weak.
You said if I did as you say, I could save her.
You told me if she had surgery, she could live.
I'm warning you just in case.
You'd better not do anything stupid.
For instance, don't turn yourself in now that your sister's dead.
Don't do anything like that.
Even if you do, you'll end up being blamed for everything.
You scum.
Why do you think we brought you into this in the first place?
Don't worry too much, though.
What we want... is for Prosecutor Park to become the culprit.
Yun Seo.
Yun Seo.
The operation's over.

Yun Seo.
Yun Seo!
Ha Yeon.
Your dad will be here soon.
Where did Mr. Rich Man go?
Miryang.
He's much younger than you.
Why call him Mister?
Mister.

If he's wealthy, we should respect him.
He could be our king or master if he's rich.
That's nonsense.
I'm sure he's in the warden's office... enjoying his afternoon tea.
This is exactly why we need money.
Money, money, money.
Inmate 3866.

Gosh.
Inmate 3866 always has interviews or visitors.
How many times is it already?
I hope you have a visitor as well, Inmate 2835.
It's too far here.

Everyone's insisting on coming, but I tell them not to.
I'll get out soon anyway.
He has no family.
Who is it?

I wouldn't know.

- I heard it's a little kid.

You'll find out soon.

Inmate 3866.

Inmate 3866.
Park Jeong Woo.
Go see Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon is dead.
Ha Yeon is dead!
My daughter is dead.
Why are you messing with me?

Please leave me alone.
Please.

- What's going on?

Ha Yeon is dead.

He'd lose his memory again.
Stop bothering me.

- Please.

Please leave me alone.
Please.
Let go of me.
He's not falling for it.
Officer!
Officer!
Officer.
Cha Min Ho.
Things won't go your way.
Ha Yeon, wait for me.
I'll come to get you soon.
(Who Am I?

Why isn't Inmate 3866 coming?

They wouldn't let him out.

He will be transferred soon.
It's probably better off this way.

And it is quiet without him.
But I want to see him before he leaves.
- We have friendships with him.

He's become insane after the trial.
What do you mean?
I'm talking about the day he made a fuss over bread.
He didn't even eat bread before.
Why would he go wild just for bread?
He'll rot in prison for good.

- Is he being transferred?

Because he's on death row.
There's no execution ground in this prison.
I see.
We won't be seeing his face again.

How can you be so cold-hearted?
- And he has no manners.

I'm the bad one.
- Let's do this.

Make sure to eat a lot.

Tae Soo?
- Tae Soo.

Everything is over now.
Once you are transferred, you will miss this place.
There's little light in there.
Even prison officers are reluctant to go there.
- What do you mean?

You will be transferred to Jinpoong Prison.
- Jinpoong?

- You'd want to kill yourself.

I should go to the prison with an execution ground.
Tae Soo.
Tae Soo.
What's going on?

No way.
Is that Cha Min Ho?
- Thank you.

I asked the people at Jinpoong Prison... to take good care of Inmate 3866.
Thank you again.
Oh, right.
What is this?
I said I'd transfer you to Seoul.
"Lee and Park"?

- Yes, it is.

It's not that they just argue a case for their clients.
They take care of their clients in prison when things go wrong.
Yes, President.
Jinpoong?
No.
I can't go there.
Cha Min Ho, you jerk.
What should I do now?
What should I do?
What am I going to do?
(Emergency Transfer)
Inmate 3866.
Get out.
It's time to say goodbye, Inmate 3866.
I mean, Mr. Park Jeong Woo.
Take care.
Let's go.
- Inmate 3866.

- These are yours.

- Thank you.

Take care.
Are you leaving just like this, Park Jeong Woo?
Come on in.
We tried to make it look nice.
I understand you don't like it.
But this is the best one we have in Woljeong Prison.
This room is not drafty, and it has an electric pad.
There won't be any other prisoners snoring at night in the next room.
Which brand of bottled water do you drink?
I will prepare it for you.
Make sure he can have a hot shower in here.
Yes, Sir.
We have a problem in the punishment cell.
What?
President Cha.
I think you need to see this.
Park Jeong Woo!
You will want to see me again.
Cha Min Ho.
- Bring him back right now.

Okay, I will.
(Cha Min Ho)
Okay.

Park Jeong Woo.
You know me.
(Cha Min Ho)
(Innocent Defendant)
It's my fault.

I'm the king in here.

Do you think President Cha can give you what you want?
I don't want a retrial.
I'm sorry, Jeong Woo.
I'm from Hanam Police Station.
Do you know Jennifer Lee?
- Let's go, Ha Yeon.

If you fail, you will die.
This is the only way.
