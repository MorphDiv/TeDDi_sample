(indistinct conversations)
Ch-Charlie, I need a new keg.
Like, if Jerry jumped off a bridge would you jump off it, too?
I want to take advantage of it.
Look, can you just tell him to get rid of Jerry first?
I'm sorry, I don't even know who that is.
And you named it?
But, yeah, fine, what do you want... you want me to put pink ink in the beer or something,
I don't want to do Valentine's Day shit, okay?
So, can we not remind them of that with inky beer?
And then we'll go back to the way things were.
It's an intestinal parasite, incapable of complex thought.
You just described my ex-husband.
That's pretty funny.
Dee is in the house, uh, Dee is in the house,
You know, trying to make her feel more at home.
Nah, we already started calling her Dee and it kind of stuck.
Don't-don't yell at the customers, okay?
Look, we got a good thing going here, all right?
We got a bunch of new customers in here.
We got a regular, we might get more regulars.
Mac is in the house, Mac is in the house.
There is an unopened crate out there.
We got a bar full of customers here.
Um, I can put a fan next to the yuck puddle,
It's about the mystery of what's inside the crate
We're always running outside, out into the world, looking for riches and treasures when we've got everything we need right here.
Oh, you're saying we do, like, a booze for money type scheme.
Whoever invented the idea of a bar.
You know, and talk about worms?
Can we just do the one thing we've never tried?
Can we just do our jobs?
♪ ♪
- ♪ ♪ - (indistinct conversations) '89, good.
Damn drunks.
Rum and Coke, tequila soda.
Pay me.
All right, that's gonna be five.
Out of 20.
Yup.
Aw, she wants another mojito.
Looks like our regular's got herself a usual.
You bet.
Can we go check out that crate now?
Shit, how'd you know?
Because the bar's still open.
You're not done till we close.
Can you go check their IDs so we don't get another underage drinking situation on our hands?
Frank, you're not done
How about you don't cook the books so we can actually tell
Oh, the soda gun's clogged.
Dude, can you go clear the lines for me?
Trick Charlie into doing it.
Well, I want you to do it.
I can't trick Charlie.
Charlie's pretending to ignore me because he's jealous of Jerry.
I-I don't want you to trick Charlie.
Lunch.
I'm craving salty, but Jerry likes sweet.
Frank, you're an animal.
He won't stop eating,
I mean, can you believe them?
You know, I can't even play Night Crawlers with him anymore 'cause he doesn't want to offend Jerry.
I'm gonna stop you there, Charlie, because
I've exhausted my daily quota of worm talk and worm-related issues.
Are they clogged?
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.
All right, let me see if I can trick Mac into it first.
I need two shots of whiskey.
Finally, somebody's actually working.
You know what, I appreciate that, Dee.
No, no, no, no, no.
Did Charlie ask you to trick me?
The soda gun is clogged, I cannot make drinks.
You know, I made him a valentine...
He hasn't given me shit yet in return.
A-A little bit nasty?
One of you put anthrax in the box.
Or do you not remember the anthrax scare?
Oh, ho, I remember the anthrax scare.
To many, 9/18 was the delivery world's 9/11.
We don't judge, Cricket, we don't judge.
We can't go around encouraging homeless men to smoke PCP in our restrooms, you know, trying to trick each other into doing our jobs and getting fired up at the-the mere mention of a crate.
It's trash that somebody left behind.
Hey, but if it's mystery you want, you know, what about the mystery of the yuck puddle?
Why won't it harden?
So why don't you and Mac go solve that goddamn mystery by cleaning it up, you know?
Well, that's-that's not such a mystery.
And we could probably trick Cricket into doing it.
Oh, why don't we just trick...
Cricket doesn't work here though.
You're not... you're not getting...
Hey, just do your jobs!
Just do your jobs.
(bubbling)
Why isn't it getting any smaller?
Oh, that must be what all the bubbling's about, 'cause it's, like, trying to communicate.
(sighs) So Dennis has sent us in here to do the impossible.
Like, there's got to be something in this whole "do your job" angle.
'Cause that doesn't sound like Dennis to me,
He's acting, like, so weird, especially towards me.
I think it's because I'm gay and he's, like,
Well, no, 'cause he's known that forever, so it's, you know...
But, look, either way, he's been acting very distant towards me, and I feel like he sent me in here to punish me or something, because, I agree, the whole, like, "do your job" angle
What?
Charlie, he doesn't want us to work at all.
He doesn't want us to mop up the yuck puddle.
Of emotions.
Of what?
He wants us to talk through our personal issues and be more open with our feelings because it's Valentine's Day.
Valentine's Day is an entire day dedicated to feelings,
And so that's why he hates Valentine's Day so much.
But he's entrusted me, because I'm a gay man
Uh, uh, Frank's gonna leave me for Jerry, man.
You know he's only doing this to get a rise out of you, right?
We're talking about Frank, okay?
If you just pretend to like the worm, then he'll probably just get rid of it.
I know so, buddy.
So, uh, you're gay, huh?
For pay or for free?
Uh, for free, I guess.
Chump.
Since when does he care how the bar does?
Unless...
Oh, my God.
Dennis doesn't want us to work the bar.
He wants us to work on ourselves.
What the shit are you talking about?
Dennis wants us to work through our personal issues so we can enjoy Valentine's Day again.
I'm so mad at Charlie, because I made him a valentine, and, you know what, he didn't even really...
I gave myself Jerry on purpose.
Well, I was right in the middle of a sentence, but... what?
I gave myself the tapeworm.
I bought poop on the dark Web and stuffed it up my butt to lose weight.
With the tip of a teaspoon.
Stop answering questions I'm not asking, okay?
(indistinct chatter)
(muttering) Charlie, I'm mad,
Wh-What are you doing?
I also got you a box of chocolates, so...
Are you making a valentine for Frank's tapeworm?
Well, not if I can't think of a word that rhymes with "Jerry."
Oh, and literally everything rhymes with "Jerry," okay?
Right in front of me?
Listen to me, I got these for him, all right?
- (laughs) - (Frank moaning)
You fool!
You wouldn't.
Oh, but I would, Frank.
You see, I knew you'd never take the pills willingly.
But Jerry...
Jerry likes sweet, doesn't he?
You poisoned me.
At worst, you're properly medicated.
(laughs)
(groans) You son of a bitch.
(Frank groans) I'm poisoned.
What are you doing?
No, no, no, nobody's been poisoned.
And there are no-no worms.
Guys, what are you doing?
Take this discussion someplace else.
No, I'm good because I've had a great Valentine's Day.
Bye-bye, Jerry.
I'm not gonna let some worm beat me on Valentine's Day.
What?
I gave myself Jerry on purpose.
Why would you do that?
To slim down for you.
Because I overheard you on the phone saying,
"He got flabby."
Take the conversation someplace else.
You-you didn't think I was too fat?
Well, no, you were fat as shit, pal, but I loved you that way, Frank.
Now, by the grace of God, we somehow still have Dottie here so, please, don't scare her away.
Sorry, Dottie.
What are you doing with the Valentine's box?
I know exactly what I'm doing.
No, you don't have to go.
I'm getting a goddamn valentine right goddamn now, or so help me God...
I will end us all.
I'm gonna sing you a song.
Uh... a Dee song.
♪ You're sweeter than a bee... tle ♪
Uh... ♪ You're the honey that the bee... makes ♪
♪ You're the... ♪
♪ Sugar on the pound... carrot ♪
What's a pound carrot?
Go with pound cake.
♪ You make ♪
♪ A-and I... ♪
♪ Love... you. ♪
Thanks, Charlie.
(lightly chuckles)
You can't rhyme very well, but... (chuckles)
That was... that was really... (laughing): really pathetic.
(laughs)
(shouts)
You made me do it!
Look, that song was derivative of a song I wrote
Frank, grab that anthrax!
I mean, I-I-I can't believe we blew another opportunity to have a working bar.
To have a successful business together!
Because you assholes get so worked up over Valentine's Day, the dumbest holiday that ever existed!
But I thought you were trying to get us to focus on ourselves and focus on Valentine's Day.
But you just couldn't do it!
Dennis, I got to say, I feel like this is just about something else.
I hate Valentine's Day.
It's because he doesn't have any feelings and we do.
Yeah, because we have feelings and you don't, and that's why you hate Valentine's Day.
I hate Valentine's Day because you assholes never got me anything!
Okay, and I have feelings!
Of course I have feelings!
A-and it hurts.
Okay, so... so... that's why I hate Valentine's Day, and that's why I put anthrax in the box.
That was you?
Yes, it was me.
I just... (sighs)
I just wanted it to stop.
(sighs)
I got the crate.
Open it.
I'm not gonna open a goddamn crate, Mac!
There's nothing in it!
Just open it.
If it'll get you to stop focusing on it and get you to stop focusing on this goddamn Valentine's Day bullshit.
I don't know why you're so excited about this goddamn thing.
There's never anything insi...
What is this?
It's a gift.
I got it for you.
For me?
Yeah.
You, uh...
You got this for me?
I ordered it off the dark Web.
I wanted it to be a surprise.
Yeah.
And how did you, um... (sniffs)
How did you know that I wanted an RPG?
'Cause I know you, man.
Also, you casually mention RPGs, like, a weird amount.
This is, uh... this is cool.
I still think Valentine's Day is a bullshit holiday, but, um... (clears throat) ...this is nice.
(sighs)
Want to shoot it?
Where's the rocket?
Yeah, that should be, uh... shit, I... there's no rocket.
Ah, there's no rocket!
They forgot to put the rocket in there!
Dude, I'm so sorry!
Mac, I don't care.
I love it.
You figured out the one thing I wanted more than anything else in the entire world and you got it for me.
And it's perfect.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Yeah.
Charlie, let's go get this worm out of my ass.
