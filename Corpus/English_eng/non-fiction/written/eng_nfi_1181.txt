Snooping.

Oh, Lord, what did you do?
I may have taken a box of keepsakes from Justin's apartment.
I really wish that I could make a simple observation about a person of color and it not be labeled as racist.
- Bullshit!

So, it'll be a party full of people that I don't like.
I found this under your couch.

Well, you know, I was thinking, um... we haven't done this before, uh, you know, but what about us taking a weekend getaway?
Like, just the two of us.
That sounds enticing, especially after being here in Vancouver.

The Obamas love it.
We could fly in and, you know, go first class the whole way.
A-A-A villa there runs about $30,000 a week, and I am all for romance, but I...
I think that's a little bit steep.
Okay, Buzzkill, what about the, uh, Hamptons?
Much better.
You're lucky I'm easy to please.
Mary Jane Paul, you are about the most un-easy to please woman that I have ever met.
Maybe you are getting to know me.
I know.

Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
I'll see you soon.
Not soon enough.

It can't be family money because his dad was a car salesman.

Oh, yeah, you wanted to speak with me.
Yeah.

The feedback is all positive.
Why am I sensing a "but"?
But there has been one unintentional consequence.
Mary Jane Paul hosted her colleagues to celebrate the big, happy "Great Day USA" family.
But the belle of the ball was conservative blogger.
Turned-correspondent, Dani Hollins, whose bubbly sense of fun has captivated viewers.
And according to insiders, it's Hollins who will be the network's big star.
That's the unintended consequence.
All of the coverage is about Dani.
Which is nothing to worry about.

Mary Jane, come here, look at this..
This school board just slashed the budget for this high school for the third time this year.
They're diverting funds to a for-profit private charter school and the students and parents are planning a big protest tomorrow.
Let me guess.

The people that orchestrated it are making bank.
It's disgusting they're taking advantage of kids who have it hard enough already, you know?
This totally ties in with all the controversy swirling around the new Education Secretary, who is a big supporter of school choice.
- Yeah.

Oh, I'm one step ahead of you, mama.
I already convinced Garrett to send you.
So, I'll get to be doing the hard-hitting stories that I want!
Exactly and you're gonna love this.

Unh-unh.

I was promised that chair when I signed my contract.
Mary Jane, this is a good thing.
I pushed really hard for you to get this story.
Yeah, keep going because you're gonna help them push me right out the door.
I'm surprised at you.
We've gotta think about your brand, honey.
We've gotta move you past fashion tips and the movie premieres.
That is morning television.

Well, I'll be damned.

And don't remind me, man.
Forty-four long-ass years ago.
So, tell me, what brings you to my door after so much time?
Hey, man, I'm not here to create any problems.
I figure maybe we could just sit down and have some conversation.
Okay.
It's a damn shame.
I spent most of my life in this city and I barely recognize it.
It's changed, hasn't it?
Hey, tell me about it.
It sure has.

As long as I'm here in this city,
I might as well... poke around a little bit, check it out.
Go see if some of our old spots are still there.
Stir up the pot a little bit.

Is that what brings you to town?
No, I'm here because of my sister, man.
Uh, she's not feeling well, and so I'm here to help her get settled in assisted living.
Is she reluctant to make a change?
Not really.

Well, it sounds like a big job on your hands.
I came here to talk to you about making amends, patching up our friendship.
You mean that?
Hey, man, remember back in the day, huh, when I was raisin' all that hell?
We were tight.
I feel I owe you.
That was a long, long time ago.
It's all in the past.
Hey, Helen, come on in here.
Guess who showed up at our doorstep?
Glory be, is this Frank Pearl?
Hello, Helen.

Nice to see you, too.
Frank's in town for a spell to help his sister.
Oh.
I just dropped by to catch up with an old friend.
- Mm-hm.

I've got some runs to make.
Oh, you'll do no such thing.
Don't let me interrupt you.
I mean, I'm sure you two have much to talk about.
Don't bother.
All that's in there is Grandma's six pints of homemade yogurt.
Yes.
She threw all the good stuff out.
But I have a secret stash.
All right.
So, uh, who's that super fly guy
Grandpa's in there with right now?
Oh, an old friend of Dad's.
I think they grew up together.
All I know is they had a falling out and haven't talked in years.
I'm glad they found each other again.
Oh.
You know, Frank is looking well.
- Is he?

He's always had a bit of a swagger.
Mm-hm, if you're trying to get me to say something, it's not going to work.

Is that what's behind this health kick you're on?

But no more!
We're gonna stand up and fight back!
Stand up, fight back!
Jacy, you're graduating this year.
Tell us why you care about the budget cuts.
Well, I'd like to be graduating, but the board stopped funding the upper-level classes I need.
They cut and they keep cutting.
This is happening in districts across the nation, where they cut arts
- and foreign languages.

Look at my class schedule.
I have three hours for lunch.
Five out of seven periods are lunch or study hall.
So, you're showing up to school, and not a lot of learning is going on.
It's gonna take my friends and I five years to graduate, just because the classes aren't there.
Five years?
All I want to do is finish school, go to college, and make something of myself.
I don't understand why the school board doesn't want that, too.
We'll get the answers to those questions, Jacy.

Almost.

Hey, Kara, the school board's been taken over by a local group that's pushing a low-tax agenda.
Yeah, and according to these bios, they have zero experience in public education.
No, it's all about the bottom line for them.
They've consistently been diverting funds away from the school, which is already struggling, and now conditions are so bad, they can make a case for closing it, and replacing it with a for-profit charter school.
Which is what they wanted all along.
It's criminal.
Do you know what happened with that school board member?

Oh, we have him here in the studio.
And now I know what I'm gonna hit him with.
Hey, Cashea, are you all right?
I'm so late.

Well, don't worry.

Let me get you started.

Hi, baby.

You wanna sit down in this chair, big boy?
Oh...
So, girl, what happened?

The bus never showed.
So, I borrowed my sister's car and wouldn't you know it...
I get pulled over for not having Samir in a car seat.
Mmmm...

A $300 ticket.

I don't have no $300.
If I did, I would've bought the damn car seat.
Exactly.
And those things are too expensive, and the kids outgrow 'em so fast.
I barely paid off the other one

Four, three, two... ♪♪ "GDU" theme music...
Mr. Russo, what do you say to the claims of an illegal takeover of the school board?
That's crazy.
My group raised money from local businesses and property owners fed up with rising taxes and failing schools.
We put forward a slate of qualified candidates committed to improving our schools.
So, your group represents
"the will of the people," in other words?
We won, didn't we?
Ask if any of their qualified candidates have kids in public schools.
Tell me what's happening at Leland High School.
What's happening is the best students and teachers have voted with their feet.
That's what school choice is about.
And what's left behind is a failing institution.
Dani, enough with the softball.
Ask him if his group took campaign money from for-profit charter management organizations.
So, why not invest money to turn the school around?
Is she for real?
But, meanwhile, the kids who are stuck there don't have time to wait for that to happen.
We need a solution now.
Stick with the script, Dani.
And what about those who say that school choice and charter schools are bad for public education?
I say a little competition might be the best thing for public schools.
Injecting the discipline of the marketplace can be the remedy for all kinds of problems, and that's why the school will be closed, and that's also why the location will become a De Novo charter school site.
Damn it, Dani.
The school board denies that it...

It won't be, and if it is, I'll back you up.
I might add, money that is no longer available to fix our school.
But have you already decided to close the school and hand it over to De Novo, a for-profit charter school.
Well, after careful consideration, the school board decided, unanimously, that it was in the best interest of the students.
Best interest of the students, or the best interest in your bottom line?
I-I-I ask because I did some research and found that you made an investment in the initial round of funding for De Novo charter schools.
- How...

I'd say that is quite a stake, and, also, a conflict of interest.
Was that investment the reason you opted to run for the school board seat?

I think keeping our lives private may not be possible.
Okay, what if I have a problem with this?
Do you have a problem with this?
Okay, I am a journalist.
I live by the mantra that I cover the story,
I don't become the story.
I want to do serious news,
I don't want to be a sideshow.
I'm right there with you.
But, facing the limelight, honey, that comes with the territory.
All right.
All I'm asking is that maybe, just maybe, we can do both.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
Let's do both.
Now, can we order lunch in today?
Italian?

Hi, Mom.
I'm not going to beat around the bush.
I'm calling because Niecy told me about you and Justin.
- Justin?

The one you left Lee for.
And don't go blaming Niecy for spilling the tea, because, well, you screamed the boy's name on live TV.
Pauletta, why did you do it?
Mom...
Justin lit a fire in me in a way that Lee just didn't.
And I know you told me not to go mucking things up with Lee, because he's loyal, and husband material, and yadda, yadda, yadda, and I agree.
But... when push comes to shove,
I just don't want to spend the rest of my life with someone who doesn't... light that fire in me, you know?
And... and, besides, I just kinda feel like... like Justin and I are more compatible.
You know, he's...

Like you.
Yeah.
- Yeah, but he's...

You don't have to explain any more.
Wow, that is not the response that I was expecting.
I just wanted to know the truth... coming from you.
No lecture?

Not from me.
Not today.
And thank you.
For what?
For your honesty.
You're lucky that you know yourself so well.
Not all of us are so fortunate.
Are you okay, Mom?
You sound... different.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, sweetie.
Uh, you take care and have a beautiful day.

You're a straight out son of a bitch, Frank Pearl.
You show up at my house, and barely say two words to me?
I figured that's what you wanted.
What I want is an apology.
I was all set to start a life with you 44 years ago.
Oh, come on, Helen.
We both know why that didn't happen.
Damn, woman, what do you want me to say?
Nothing.
I've said my peace, and it's probably best to leave it all in the past.
They still out there?
You wanna take separate doors or...
Tell me, this ♪WholsJustin thing, is it still trending?
Yep.
And the crazy video with Dani?
That, too.
If we do this, can we turn the focus back to the protest, to what happened at the school?
Possibly.
But we'll have the spotlight, so we can take it there.
So, we go out together.
Are you ready?
Yeah.

We can use this for good, Justin.
Yeah.
You're playin' with my career, and it takes a lifetime to build a reputation, and five minutes to ruin it forever, and this is...

I promise you, whatever happens,
I take full responsibility, okay?
Okay.
