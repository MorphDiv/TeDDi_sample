We escaped in a boat with only a map and compass.
You said you would cure me if I helped you.
I think I can help you find Helena.
What are you doing here?
Do you remember this guy?

According to Adele, they're all funneling funds into a Dyad shell, which has made payments of hundreds of millions of dollars.
What are they using that for?

- Controlled by this man here.

John Patrick Matheson.

- Let's go, Siobhan.

Ugh!
Ferdinand, you came back.
How did you know?
Oh, shit.

Sorry.

Not a thing.
It's too quiet.

What's not to like?
Our friends are coming.

- I'll pour you a cuppa.


- Come on, babe.

Yeah.

OK.
- That is Charlotte.

- Hi.

So, you're what my mom looked like.
Yeah.

Yeah, they'll be safe with my ex.
Plus, my daughter will get a kick out of it.
I don't get it.

Enger's AWOL too.

Rachel must have shown the Cabal our proof of P.T.'s real identity.
Those men on the board, they're realizing they've been had.

So finally, Rachel's their target?
Well, she's certainly a liability.
Come on.

OK, here's one.
"There is nothing I wouldn't do for my friends.
"I have no notion of doing things by halves.
It's not my nature." You guess who that is?
It is Jane...
- Austen.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Hundreds of millions of people are about to be required to submit their DNA, and Neolution is behind it.
- They need that data.

- or do you wanna have brunch?

Siobhan wants a summit.
You're calling them or what?
They're calling us!
"Us"?

Oh, wait for it, chicken.
Hello, North American scum!
We bought
- a shit mountain of cheese.

- Hello!

Yeah.

Tonight's my big coming out party.
Your art opening.
An art opening?

- No!

It's an exceptional idea!
And I'm really sorry that you can't come close.
- What?

You're gonna dress up as Sarah?
This is my first show in two years;
I'm not gonna have any kind of sestrashenanigans.

He's got some big wheels coming in.

Adele's making appetizers.

And you can totally come later if you want to, I promise.
I do.

But, Mom, if P.T.'s lost the board, that means
- Neolution's on the ropes.

Delphine, you showed us what to do with it.
And we deserve a breather tonight to stand down and support Felix.
I think you're right, Siobhan.

- Have we?

Thank you for letting me stay.
I don't have a family anymore;

What?
When did Mark die?
Two weeks ago.
How did you find me again?
Well, you told me about Sister Irena, how she... fed you when the other nuns locked you up and how she came to the New World after they cut out her tongue.
You don't trust me?
♪ I don't blame you
- after what my father did to you.

These are miracle babies.
I'm sorry I came.

You still have family.
♪ You see?
They remember you.
They're saying hello.
Alright.
- Uh, how's Helena over here, Aly?

Yeah, but left?

- in relation to her sisters?

OK, this is a test, right?
I'm gonna do something and then you're gonna
- lambast me for doing it wrong?

What's wrong with this?
Should I untuck?

Donnie is perfect.

- behind the bar.

- Thank you.

- Yeah.

- and I have a performance idea.

Oh, God, no.
You ready for that whiskey, Adele?
Oh, hell, yes!

OK, we're not done here.

- after this Al-Khatib guy.

He controls their slush fund.
I mean, he's so protected, it's not even funny.
If he is bribing governments for citizens' genetics, then we've got to...
Leave it, love, will you?

- with the snacks.

I'm going southern regional.

Great!

- Where are you off to?

- Mom!

OK,sothat's144 prepareddoses
- of the inoculate.

And depending how much of the cellular culture survived, we can manufacture twice that again.
Then what?

Yeah.

But we still don't know how many there are.
Well, that's what we're gonna find out.
- Right, Scotty?

- Where are you going?

I thought we were all heading over to Felix's together.
- I'll catch you guys later, OK?

We have this whole "don't-ask don't-tell" thing going on.
Ciao.
Hey.
- You're ready?

Wouldn't it be safer if the others knew?
We have one shot at this, and if it's gonna work,
Sarah can't know who we dealt with to get here.
- What about after?

- Are we good?

OK.
I so love being in the middle of all of this.
♪
Oh...
Rachel.
Rachel is rather impressed with our transgressive
- little alliance, aren't you?

Sarah doesn't know you two
- are here, does she?

And our interests are very firmly aligned as you now have a nice, big, fat target on your back, too.
♪ So...
Neolution goes down for good,
- or we all do.

♪

You'd be dead if I hadn't called him in to save you.
After you.
So, we spiked our gluhwein with vodka.
- Gluhwein and intrigue, nice!

And, um, Felix and I actually got some serious après-ski cred by the end of it, but Delphine was, like, all business.
What was S even doing with her out there?
- I don't know.

I have no idea.

Westmorland wants unprecedented access to human genetics, and Hashem Al-Khatib was bribing governments worldwide to get it.
But you don't have record of any of that, do you?
No, but Neolution want to sell curated, commercialized evolution to the one percent who can afford it.
So they can live forever, grow a bloody tail if they want to.

How's that sitting with you these days?
You saved my granddaughter.
I'm willing to take a gamble on nature over nurture.
This is all the supporting evidence to our claims.
Without proof of bribes, it would barely carry a news cycle.
You're a smart woman, Rachel.
Like any good CEO, you kept a shadow file, a record of where the bodies are buried.
Give me the proof I need to back this up.
Give yourself a chance to be truly free.
- Let Cosima make an appearance.

- Yes!

What I need is for you to leave right now before people start arriving and something "cloney" happens.
- Alison, I'm already on...

It's already happening.
Right?
- Well...

- Colin.

Hello.
Oof!

And often.

Hmmm.
- Oh, this is my, uh... foster sister, Sarah.
You, uh...

Cool!

- You alright?

I-I remember the time I ID'd your dead body.
Yes, but we got over that, didn't we, Colin?
- Did we?

- I think we did.

Hello!

Enjoy yourselves.

Hey, mind you, I want you to meet someone.
Congratulations.
Both of you.
That book is about your life?
Yes.

It's my... joys and my pain and sorrows, so they walk a brighter path.
Sestra Irina is going to town, so we have to take care of toilet.
- "Toilet"?

Come when you are done.
Gracie.
- Hello, Mark.

Have you found her?
No.

Gracie,
I'm depending on you.

I'm checking another convent tomorrow.

I miss you, Mark.
♪

I love you.
Is she lying?
Oh, good Lord, don't look now.

- Who's he?

He's the gallerist from Geneva.

Well then, do... do something.

Cosima is dropping off Scott.
Maybe you could use us.

Alright.

- Ooh!

Music!
Now drop the accent and be yourself.
Ezra!

Felix.
Gentlemen, I would like you to meet my sister,
Hestia.
Goddess of hearth and home. ♪
Aaah...

Where do you live in the real world?
I live deep in Bailey Downs, which, uh, which is a suburb just-just north of here.
Oh!

Champagne?
Napkin?
No alcohol for me.

You look different.
Yes, well, I'm...

Identity is a social construct, boys.
Danke.
Oh, my God, that was completely perfect!
They're utterly confused.

OK, alright.

- I love you.

- Felix, are we clear?

- Felix...

- Congratulations!

God, you look so rosey-cheeked.

Yeah, I'm back...

Yeah, you are!

- Oooh...

Scotty, curtain.

Goddess of wisdom and of deep thoughts.
That's you.
Brilliant.
Just do whatever comes naturally.
OK, well, what are you saying, Sarah?
We're late.

I-I am dressed.

Your mom is at the florist, hon.
She's thinking about your brother.
- Are you?

Do you have any idea how hard your brother's been working
- for tonight?

Why don't I tell you my problem?
The entire time that we were gone, he was painting you, different versions of you.
But you don't seem to care.
And Delphine, I don't know.

The only thing I know is... is a phone call with... about a meeting with a French guy.
- Francis or Fernando or...

Maybe.

He killed my sister.
Oh.
This is a bloody gold mine.
Do you realize what we could do with this information?
- Yes.

She needs me.
I'm the one with a smoking gun.
Names, dates, amounts.

Ohhhh...
I bloody love you.
With this... we could squeeze anything we want out of those Neo pricks.
This is, uh...
It's the fortune we dreamed of.
Freedom from all of them.
I gave Sarah her daughter back;
I don't owe them anything.
Why am I getting text from my sister saying that you and S are up to something?
I don't know, Felix.
Maybe it's because we are up to something.
Great!

- Tequila?

- Claro!

- Santé.

- Hmm!

Oh, my God!
- Art.

Uhhh, she's on her way.

Just let me know when she gets here, OK?
Oh, you'll know.
Van Lier confirmed the meet?
They're assembling in an hour.

- They'll be amenable.

- Ah!

Just let it pass.
There's another way.
We can choose to make my information public.
I have a sizeable nest egg.
It wouldn't last forever, but if we wanted, we could destroy
Westmorland and Neolution, go somewhere warm,
- off the grid.

Lounging around at low tide in our flip flops, browsing Reader's Digest, dipping toast points into egg yolks.
Glorious.
But with this, we can build a dynasty.
Obscene wealth.
Anything we want.
Who's your daddy?
You are.
You like it that much?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, it's just... we're on the precipice of being able to do anything that we want.
What do you want to do with our freedom?
- I want...

- Oh, Felix, nooo!

You... you've done something wonderful.
Yeah.

- Best?

That's exquisite company, isn't it?
Yeah.

- Sold.

- Thank you.

You own me.
- Hey!

Time's up.
Incredible!

I don't know what S did, but tell Sarah that she...
Tell her yourself.
- Alright.

Love you.

Oh, my God!

- Is S here?

- Oh, crap!

Do you know who S's real source was,
- the one who got us to Coady?

- with you.

What?

I spilled some beans.
She's in league with him.

- are cutting a deal with Rachel.

That's... terrible.

And you're not gonna like this either, but, DONNIE, CURTAIN!

Darling, come on.

Just take the stage.

Hey.
Clean floor.

Gracie,it'sme .
We need to know if you found her yet.

Please.

- Coady said she could help, but...

- We are family!

I knew it when I saw you, which is why I told him I couldn't find you.
- Didn't tell them where you are.

- No!

Yes.
They will trace it.

Gentlemen, ladies of the board.
Oh, Rachel has a bit of a headache, I'm afraid.
- She plucked out her own eye.

- Suicides.

That must be like Neolution Black Friday.
The shame.

Not all of us were deceived.
Oh, Mr. Al-Khatib, with your dirty hands,
- so glad to hear you say that.

Show us the evidence and tell us how much you want.
Enclosed are a list of key patents food, pharmaceuticals, cloning, gene editing, sequencing, biosurveillance.

But judging by the size of these bribes, you'll all be making billions anyway.
May I?
He won't be coming back.
You're doing the right thing, Rachel.
To the wrong man, the only one who ever really loved me.
We do what we can.
Each of us in our own way.

Chipping at the devil 'til he's done.
There, uh... seems to be some, uh, technical difficulty.
He has nothing.

Rest assured this is not over.
We are not finished with any of you!
I have food for us.
Come, Gracie, we have to go.
Get off!

We don't want to harm

I know.
It won't hurt.
It's OK.
You're forgiven.
Hey.

Why wouldn't I be?
- Incoming.

I'm sorry, love.

You've worked with M.K.'s murderer!
I knew you couldn't stomach it; he was the key to Rachel.
Hey!

- Shhh.

- Well, I'm over it.

What did you pull with Rachel?
She gave us the missing piece of the puzzle.
Full financial records of Neolution's dark money bribes.
What?
proof of decades of illegal human experiments and of Coady's sterilization plan.

- to expose them.

Yeah.
It's done.
This is it?

We could have ended up in any family.

- Come on!

she chose us as her own.
We are who we are because she carried two little London urchins on her wings to Canada.
Watching her raise my sister, watching my sister raise her own daughter... finding my biological sister, it's quite mad.
It's taught me that we are all... mysterious works of chance.
A choice of nature versus nurture.
- Hi.

So, to my galaxy of women, thank you for the nurture.
- So proud of you.

Alright!

- Felix!

That was a deathtrap, that meeting.
- You expected them to kill me.

What?

You expected me to take a payoff?
That is how we win!
No, we win if Neolution is exposed, and Westmorland is stripped of his myth!
Where's your smoking gun, Rachel?
There's nothing for you here.
Oh, you gave it
