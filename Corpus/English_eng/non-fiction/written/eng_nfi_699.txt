Once Upon a Time S06E20 "The Song in Your Heart"
Sync and corrected by Gianluca Belfiglio
Did you decide which one?
Well, Emma, I didn't want to say anything because
I wasn't sure that the curse even brought it over from the Enchanted Forest, but I had Belle scour the back of Gold's shop, and she found it.
My wedding dress!
Do you want to wear it?
Well, I dropped it off at the dry cleaner, and it should be back in plenty of time for the wedding tonight.
Oh, mom, that's...
Thank you!
With all we've been through lately,
I just never thought we'd get a moment like this.
[door opens]
Snow, Snow, it's going to be okay.
No, Charming, it's not!
You heard Rumple.
There is nothing we can do to stop the Evil Queen.
I promise you, we will find a way to protect our daughter.
But right now, she needs something more important.
She needs her mother to rest.
All right.
I just need some air.
♪♪
I wish we had what we needed to help Emma to give her a chance at a happy ending.

I never was a fan of white weddings.
How are you still here?
Did you really think you could turn my own son against me?
What the hell are you doing here?
Why are you crashing my daughter's wedding day?
Because Emma and I are destined to fight.
Light and dark must have their reckoning.
Unless, of course...
What?
Unless you give me your heart now and save us both the trouble of fighting the Final Battle.
You really think I'll just surrender to you.
I know you think you're strong, Emma.
But I've spent centuries collecting orphans just like you.
And we both know deep down, you're still the lonely little girl you always were.
I hate to break it to you, but I've grown up.
Then you'll know what your up against.
The Final Battle is coming, whether you want it or not.
[laughs] [gate rattles]
Is that all...
Black Fairy Dust.
Enough to curse Storybrooke 10 times over.
So, that's how the Black Fairy plans to win the Final Battle... by separating us with a curse.
It's tied to the clock tower.
The moment it strikes 6:00, it'll be released.
That's when Hook and I are getting married.
Well, you have to admit, she's got a flair for the dramatic.
Emma, I know that you feel responsible, but this is not just your fight.
She seemed to think it was.
Yeah, well the last time I checked, she doesn't get a vote.
Zelena and I will figure out a way to disable this thing.
I ruined your parents' wedding.
The least I can do make sure you get to enjoy yours.

[David] What's wrong?
Do you think Emma will be disappointed if I don't wear it?
I don't think she'll mind.
Emma.
Swan, don't you know it's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding?
Dad, can you give us a minute?
Yeah, of course.
What is it, luv?
And now she's casting a curse that's going to separate me from everyone, so that I have to fight the Final Battle alone.
Killian, this is one I need to win on my own.
Isn't that what she wants?
If you come with me, it just gives her a chance to hurt one more person I love.
And I can't let her do that.
You've obviously made up your mind, so why did you come here then?
To tell you not to worry.
And at 6:00 P.M., I will be there to say "I do."
No, that's not it.
You've come to say goodbye in case it doesn't work.
Killian...
Let me help.
I love you.
[laughter]
[Charming] You think the wish affected them?
You there, pirate.
Are you the Captain of a ship called the Jolly Roger?
I always thought I exuded authority.
[Hook] He's not the Captain.
Iam.
Allow me to introduce myself.
Captain Hook.
We need you to take us to the Evil Queen so we can save our daughter.

Show yourself, Dark One.
It takes a brave man to walk into my shop like that.
You betrayed Emma.
You betrayed all of us.
I simply did what was necessary to keep my family together.
Not that I'd expect a pirate like you to understand.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
[grunting]
A little bit of dreamshade I brought back from Neverland.
I think it almost killed you once before.
But it didn't, as I'm immortal.
Well, I don't need to kill you now.
Just, you know, knock you out long enough
[Gold's body thuds] for Emma to defeat your mother.
And then...
I'm gonna finally skin myself a crocodile.
[whoosh] There's just one problem.
My son's not the only one looking out for his family.
[thud]
[door opens, closes]
Let me guess, you're here to talk me out of going up against the Black Fairy.
No.
I'm here to tell you you're doing the right thing.
Really?
The Final Battle... it's why I brought you to Storybrooke in the first place.
I know you can do it.
Thanks, kid.
Well, what are you doing here?
Well, I can't go into battle with the people I love, so I was just reminding myself of all the things I have to fight for.
[closes box]
What's this?
[young Emma humming] [humming stops]
Are you okay?
What was that?
Nothing.
If I'm gonna do this, I need to do this now.
I don't have a lot of time before her curse hits.
♪♪
I can't find anything to stop the Black Fairy's curse.
Think about it.
You were the first person to cast her original dark curse.
You know her magic better than anyone.
There has to be something you learned back then that you can use against her this time.
Time.
That's it!
The first curse stopped time.
If I can isolate that part of the spell, it'll stop the curse from happening.
Show yourself, dearie.
The Queen!
The Queen, the Queen, the Queen.
It's the Charmings.
They cast a spell so everyone breaks into song.
Mm.
They plan to use it to stop my curse...
The curse you gave me.
Ha.
Which means you're going to tell me how to stop them.
Now sing!
[clears throat]
[giggles]
I'd rather gouge my eyes out with a rusty fork.
And I didn't chose you to cast my curse so you could come crying to me at every itty-bitty sign of trouble.
Oh, please.
I'm the best student who ever walked through your door.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
And what's that supposed to mean?
It means if you want to prove I chose the right witch, go fix it.

Is that it?
Yes, the answer to stopping the Black Fairy's curse.
Okay, now we'll fight the Black Fairy together.
Good work.
Well, I had a little help.
I wonder what our sorry excuse of a teacher would say if he could see us now?
[Gold] How about, "Thank you"?
[gasps]
Now, this was made to freeze the curse.
I wonder how well it's gonna work on people.
So, have you finally come to your senses and decided to surrender?
Let's start the Final Battle now.
Funny, I was thinking the same thing.
Hm.
I was planning to wait for my curse to separate you from your family, but they ended up doing my work for me.
[whoosh]
I'll kill you.
Will you, now?
Because I've been watching you, Emma.
Or should I say, listening?
[young Emma humming]
Do you know what I hear?
A little girl who's all alone in this world.
A girl who's weak, without hope.
I used to go to sleep to the sounds of misery like that every night in the mines.
I'll show you misery.
[whoosh, thud] [giggles]
What did you do?
I didn't do anything, just made you face the truth.
You can't do this alone.
[sighs]
What did she do to you?
She just reminded me what it was like to feel something I haven't felt in a really long time.
She reminded me what it felt like to be alone.
Even if she froze our family, you're not alone.
I don't understand.
What does it have to do with fighting the Final Battle?
It's not about the singing.
It's just where it started.
It's not about the little things that I couldn't do on my own.
It was every time something big came along, I ran from it.
Henry, I wasn't even brave enough to keep you.
Mom.
That was a long time ago.
You've changed.
Because you came into my life.
And you helped me build a family, and that let me do things I never thought I could.
You're the Savior.
You can still beat her and save everyone.
The only way I can do that is if I give the Black Fairy my heart the way she wanted in the first place.
But she'll kill you.
You brought me here to bring back the happy endings.
Maybe this is the way I was supposed to do it.
This isn't how the book's supposed to end.
Because if I fight and I lose, then I know you won't have anyone.
At least this way, I know you'll have the rest of our family.
In here.
Where is she?
Looking for me?
Snow White.
I haven't had a chance to congratulate you on that little bundle brewing inside.
That's far enough.
You should make it easy on yourself and come with us now.

[together] There's a powerful magic...
What's there to understand?
I won.
You took our song from us.
Oh, not just yours.
Everyone's.
How?
With a little something I happened to find in my vault.
Green isn't my color, but it seems to have done the trick.
No!
[whoosh]
I guess this proves love isn't the strongest magic of all.
Enjoy what little time you have left as a family.
Snow, are you okay?
What do you think?
What happened?
The wish should've worked.
Blue.
You granted the wish.
But it didn't work.
The Evil Queen took the song from us.
No one can do that.
But I'm afraid its magic was never meant for you to use against the Evil Queen.
Then, who was it for?
Emma.
You wished that she could have a chance for a happy ending.
And now, with everyone's song in her heart, she will.
I mean, how does that help her?
One day, she will face a battle like no one has ever faced before.
And I'm afraid she will have to face it alone.
But she won't be alone.
She'll have the voices of the people who love her inside of her heart.
In the morning, we'll have forgotten that we ever sang in the first place.
Not even the Evil Queen will remember.
That way, the songs will remain safe.
Then, how will Emma know she has them inside her?
We will just have to hope that they find their way to the surface when she needs them the most.
There has to be a different ending to this story.
Aah!
Where'd that come from?
♪♪
She's not alone.
She never was.

Killian!
♪♪ [low hum of chat]
[Archie] Are you ready to recite your vows?
Emma, when we met, there was just one thing that mattered to me...
Getting my revenge.
And you did something that no one else ever could.
You showed me that a heart full of love was the most precious treasure of all, and one that I don't intend to lose.
They say that a captain's heart belongs to his ship.
And with this ring, it now belongs to you.
Killian, I spent so much of my life on my own.
And then, Henry found me and brought me to Storybrooke, and helped me find the rest of my family.

I do.

I do.
