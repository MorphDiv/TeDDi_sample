(ENGINES ROARING)
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
All right, all right.
You wanted to speak with me?
I've got something to show you.
What's this about?
A lightsaber?
Not just any lightsaber.
(LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING)
It can't be.
So you recognize it?
That I do.
It is the darksaber, a symbol for the leader of House Vizsla, and later, the group known as Death Watch.
I didn't know Mandalorians developed a type of lightsaber.
We didn't.

Legend tells that it was created over a thousand years ago by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian ever inducted into the Jedi Order.
After his passing, the Jedi kept the saber in their temple.
That was, until members of House Vizsla snuck in and liberated it.
They used the saber to unify the people and strike down those who would oppose them.
One time, they ruled all of Mandalore wielding this blade.
This saber is an important symbol to that house and respected by the other clans.
I imagine Sabine was excited to recover it.
(HUFFS) You wouldn't know it.
After we got back from Dathomir, she gave it to me for safekeeping and hasn't brought it up since.
She doesn't want the responsibility.
Kanan, if Sabine can wield this saber, she can reunite one of the most powerful houses in all of Mandalore.
You're talking about raising an army.
With Sabine leading it.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)
Come in.
(GRUNTING)
Who all is there?
(CHOPPER GRUNTS)
Everybody, huh?
(PURRING)
I won't do it.
So you do know what the darksaber is.
I know it caused my family nothing but trouble after Maul took it.
Maul used it to divide and conquer our people.
You can wield it to do the opposite.
Wield it?

Kanan, tell him he's crazy.
Consider what he has to say.
What?

I don't think it's a coincidence this saber came into your possession.
Yeah, but, Kanan, that doesn't mean she can fight with it.
No offense.
Go on.
What I mean is...
Look, it's taken me a while to learn, and, I mean, I use the Force.
She might not be able to fight like a Jedi, but she can learn to be proficient with the blade.
I am proficient, with many types of blades and blasters and explosives, but that is a lightsaber.
The combat training is not as important as what that blade represents.
Right, right, you want me to lead my clan.
I don't know if you realize this, but I'm not that popular with my family these days.
That can change.
No, it can't.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I know that family is important to the Wrens, just like it is to all Mandalorians.
I have a family, here, on this ship.
I don't need them.
HERA:

If there's a chance that you can rally an army of Mandalorian warriors to our cause,
I have to ask you to do it.
Hera.
Family history can be painful.
Believe me, I know.
But we can use those warriors for our attack on Lothal.
Hera's right.

You can walk away and forget about it.
(SIGHS)
All right.

Just give me the saber.
Listen.

And you need to be able to defend yourself.
Okay, I'll try my best.
First lesson, don't try.
Just learn.
Give me the sword.
I'm gonna learn how to kick your...
Sabine.
Okay.
Hey, why can't we just practice back at the base?
It's better out here.

Keeps your mind focused.
And it's safer for everyone else.
You'll do less damage.
I'll damage you if you don't shut up.
(SIGHS)
When you said you were going to be training me,
I thought there'd be more sword fighting involved.
Hey, it's always like this.
He was the same with me.
Yeah, and look how well you've turned out.
Are you being serious?

I can never tell.
We should get started.
Uh, try not to sound so excited.
Hey, what's this?
Training saber.
Really?
Before we start with the real thing,
I want to see your technique.
I already know how to fight with a stick.
Then this should be easy for you.
(NECK CRACKS)
(GRUNTING)
(GROANS)
Oh!
That might work on a stormtrooper, but not me.
(GRUNTS)
(STRAINING)
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
(PANTING)
And that's your head.
Every mistake is a limb lost.
The blade is never at rest.
(SIGHS)
Okay, let's go again.
(SIGHS) No.
You better practice with Ezra first.
All right.

Ezra, walk her through the forms.
Kanan!
Okay, ready position.
Sabine!

Okay, great.
Yeah, that's ready position.
Now we go one, two...
EZRA:

You're not gonna learn this in one day.
SABINE:

One...two...three...
(COMLINK BEEPING) I read you, Hera.
HERA:

I wanted to see how things are going.
Ugh, slowly.
Ezra's still taking her through the basic forms with the training sabers.
Training sabers?
You mean those sticks you and Zeb made?
KANAN:

Were you careful with Ezra?
I don't remember him fighting with a stick.
Well, maybe I'm trying to do things differently this time.
HERA:

No.

But you have to be open to it.
Sabine is blocked.

She's so expressive and yet so tightly wound.
She's so...

(GROANS) Very.
I'll be sending out supplies.
Is there anything specific that you need?
KANAN:

Hmm.

That's not gonna work.
Working so far.

(BOTH GRUNTING)
I think you're doing well.
Opinion noted.
(GRUNTS)
I've got your supplies.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
(YELLS)
(GRUNTS)
You overcommitted.
Oh, good.
Anyone else have an opinion they want to share?
Let's take a break.
Ezra, help unload these supplies.
What?

Shouldn't I get the break?
Word is it's been tough going.
I brought you something, since you're partially in this mess on my recommendation.
I'm sorry, "partially"?
How about completely?
To make up for that, you can have these.
Whoa.

Where did you get these?
Try them on.
Grappling line, paralyzing darts, repulsor.
All designed to combat the abilities of the Jedi.
Go take Bridger down a peg or two.
(SCOFFS) What have you got there?
More than you can handle.
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe I won't go easy on you this time.
(GRUNTING)
(VAMBRACE ACTIVATES)
(EZRA GRUNTS)
(BOTH STRAINING)
(CHUCKLES) And that's your head.
Hey!

Special delivery.
(CHUCKLES)
Hey!
Is this a game for you?
No game, just outsmarting my opponent.
Care to take a shot?
(LASSO WHOOSHING)
(LIGHTSABER WHOOSHING)
(GRUNTS)
History lesson.

These tricks will amount to something, maybe save you from time to time, but they won't keep you alive in the long run.
Only training... and discipline will do that.
The only thing I'm learning is that Ezra must be really gifted to learn as well as he has from a lousy teacher like you.
(GRUNTS)
(SIGHS)
Hey.
Not now, Ezra.
Look...

Believe me,
Kanan's not the easiest teacher to have, but he means well.
(SCOFFS) Does he?

I know how to fight.
I believe I can learn to use that sword.
I just don't want everything that comes with it.
You mean your family?
I'm a disgrace to them, Ezra.
A traitor.
But that's not true.
To them it is.
You don't know.
No one does.
I don't want to talk about these things.
How can I lead my people?
How can I go back there and face them?
I'm sorry, Sabine.
At least you have parents to go back to.
(SIGHS) Ezra...
(RUMBLING)
Teaching Ezra wasn't easy, but you did it well.
I'm sure you'll find a way to get through to Sabine.
It's not the same.

(CHUCKLES) Sometimes too eager.
I was the one who was holding back.
And that's not what you're doing now?
No.
And yet, you still won't let her train with the darksaber.
Look, Sabine is a capable warrior.
In some ways, more so than Ezra, but she can't... or won't find balance within herself.
Until she does, wielding an actual lightsaber is far too dangerous for her.
By letting her pretend with that stick, you're only encouraging her not to commit to this.
You're not listening to me.
If I let her use the darksaber, she will get hurt.
She's already hurt.
Her family hurt her more than any sword could.
You don't see it because she doesn't want you to.
But you can?
Because I know what it's like when people you love don't believe in you, when they let you walk away.
Remember how hard it was for her to trust us.
(SIGHS)
Hmm.
So what do you want me to do?
Give her the sword.
Let her own it and who she is.
Help Sabine face her demons.
(SIGHS) I don't know.
I know you don't.
But this isn't about you.
I didn't think she'd be gone this long.
She'll return.

I know she can do it, but it just seems like Kanan is asking her to learn everything at once.
She just needs more time.
Time is a luxury, one the galaxy seems to be running out of.
She's back.
I owe you an apology.
I can say the same.
Uh, maybe I should practice more first.
Take it.

Ignite the blade.
(DARKSABER ACTIVATING)
Whoa.
It's heavier than I thought.
Energy constantly flows through the crystal.
You're not fighting with a simple blade as much as you are directing a current of power.
Your thoughts, your actions, they become energy.
They flow through the crystal as well, and become a part of the blade.
(LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING)
The blades will be drawn to each other.
Block high.
(BLADES CRACKLING)
There's pull.

That sword is old, heavy, but powerful.
Respect its strength.
(BLADES WHOOSHING)
Block low.
High.
Middle.
High.
Low.
Middle.
Good.

Are you ready?

Remember the forms Ezra taught you.
Take ready position.
We'll start slow.
One...two... three... four...five... six...
Faster.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
(RAPIDLY) One, two, three, four, five, six.
You're making it easy on me.
Ready position.
(DARKSABER ACTIVATING)
One, two, three, four, five, six.
The blade feels lighter.
You're connecting with it.
It's becoming a part of you.
(GRUNTING)
But you cannot rely solely on the blade.
(YELLS)
You must use all your skills together.
Ready position.
(BLADES CRACKLING)
You'll have to do better.
Whoa.
(DARKSABER ACTIVATING)
(GRUNTS IN PAIN)
You're not fighting me, you're fighting yourself... and losing.
(GRUNTS ANGRILY)
You're not committed to this.
You should quit.
I don't quit.

Really?

(GRUNTS)
You did run, didn't you?

But that's what your people believe, isn't it?
(GROWLS)
You ran from the Empire.

So what's the truth?

(ENERGY CRACKLING)
The truth... is that...
I left to save everyone.
My mother, my father, my brother!
Everything I did was for family, for Mandalore!
I built weapons, terrible weapons, but the Empire used them on Mandalore, on friends, on family.
People that I knew.
They controlled us through fear.
(SCOFFS) Mandalore!
Fear of weapons I helped create.
I helped enslave my people!
I wanted to stop it.
I had to stop it.
I spoke out!
I spoke out to save them.

(GRUNTS)
But when I did...
My family didn't stand with me.
They chose the Empire.
They left me.
Gave me no choice.
The Empire wanted to destroy worlds.
And they did.
(VOICE BREAKING) They destroyed mine.
(SOBBING)
The Empire rules with fear.
And not everyone can be as strong as you've been.
Your family is in a prison, one of their own making.
It's up to you to help them out of it.
But how?
Why?
Why would they believe me?
Why would they follow me?
FENN:

But for what it's worth,
I would follow you.
EZRA:

And I mean it.
You've come a long way in a very short time.
Where you go from here is up to you.
But know, this family, will stand by you no matter what you choose.
