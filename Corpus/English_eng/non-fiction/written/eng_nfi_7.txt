Is JB!
My friends say I'm a fool to think that you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love
'Cause honestly the truth is that you know I'm never leavin'
'Cause you're my angel sent from above
Baby you can do no wrong
My money is yours give you little more
Because I love ya, love ya
With me girl, is where you belong
Just stay right here I promise my dear
I'll put nothin above ya, above ya
Love me,
Say that you love me
Fool me,
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me,
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me
Love me,
Say that you love me
Fool me,
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me,
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me
People try to tell me but I still refuse to listen
'Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love,
Your love
Baby you can do no wrong
My money is yours give you little more
Because I love ya, love ya
With me girl, is where you belong
Just stay right here I promise my dear
I'll put nothin above ya, above ya
Love me,
Say that you love me
Fool me,
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me,
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me
Love me,
Say that you love me
Fool me,
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me,
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me
My heart is blind, but I don't care
'Cause when I'm with you everything has disappeared
And every time I hold you near
I never wanna let you go,
Love me,
Say that you love me
Fool me,
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me,
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me
Love me,
Say that you love me
Fool me,
Oh, how you do me
Kiss me,
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me
