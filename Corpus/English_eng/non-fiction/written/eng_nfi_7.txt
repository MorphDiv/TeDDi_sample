I love everything about you You're imperfectly perfect
Everyone's itching for beauty But just scratchin' the surface
Lost time is never found Can the DJ please reverse it
In life we pay for change Let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it When people say you don't deserve it
Then don't give in, 'cuz hate may win some battles But love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun While the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you It's only right that
All around the world People want to be loved
