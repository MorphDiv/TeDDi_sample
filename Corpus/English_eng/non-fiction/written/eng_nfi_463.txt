Once a poster boy for good policing.
But tonight, Roger Rogerson is a convicted killer for murdering a young student in a drug deal gone wrong.
Rogerson's nickname, "The Dodger", was well-earned.
Back in his glory days, he was nominated for bravery awards.

A jury cleared Rogerson over Lanfranchi's death.
Lanfranchi's girlfriend, prostitute Sallie-Anne Huxtep, publicly implicated Rogerson.
She was murdered.

Rogerson was once known as "The Enforcer"... cunning, ruthless, brilliant.
_
_
This is home for the rest of my life.
They convicted me of murder and commercial drug supply.
I'm not complaining, just telling you.
Right?
Probably my earliest memory,
I was sitting on my father's shoulders, watching a parade.
In 1945, soldiers home from winning the war, beating the Japs.
All I ever wanted to be was one of them, a hero.
And I am.
Get out!

You sleep easy 'cause people like me kept things neat and tidy.
You know,
I probably know more about criminals and how to catch them than any other ten blokes in the country.
Makes you wonder how I got in here.
But, that's another story.
That's what happens when you cross paths with shitheads.
_
All right, in you go.
A lot of crims, some of them still in here, who'll tell you that I verballed 'em.
Maybe I did, some of them.
You know, maybe I did.

Tell a little porky pie.

Maybe I'm telling porky pies now.
But there are the facts, then there's the truth.
And they aren't always a match.
Hello, Warren.
I've been in this force since I was a kid.
How dare they treat me this way.
Get off him!

Shit, take your hands off him, you pig!

- You fuckin' pig!

They'd sacked me and I'd been out of the force for four years, doing any shit job I could find...
- Stay down!

- back into the main game.

- And here it was.

- I've no idea, Officer.

- This was a chance to get him onside.

Really?

Sweetheart, is this yours?
- No!

But to do it, I'd have to cross Mark Standen, a Fed, star investigator.
They were calling him the new Roger Rogerson.
Bring him along.

Just trying to have a night out here, Officer!
Mickel!

Mickel!
Mickel, just shut up!
To save Hurley, I was going to have to switch evidence, which was doable with a few old cop mates.
Cocaine looks a lot like baby formula, you know?
Weigh it.

Senior, charge 'em both.

But I had nothing to do with this.

- I'm not staying here.

It's not mine.

The press called me "disgraced former detective", but I was always welcome in my old station.
Robbo.

- G'day, mate.

Switch this for us, will ya, mate?
- There you are, you beautiful man!

- Baby formula.

Who would have thought it?
Don't... don't ever kiss me again, right?
- What do I owe ya?

Well, not that.

Whatever it is, I'll double it.
- Well, don't double your kiss.

- here for everyone.

- Drinks for everybody!

We here for a good time, or a short one?
I'm here for a good time, mate.
Just get off me, will ya?
- Jesus!

- Having a good night?

- Mate, what can I do for ya?

- Now will you have a drink with me?

- Why won't you have a drink with me?

- Making me drink alone?

Why don't ya?
- 'Cause I'm working.

Have one!
- Just to shut you up.

He tried to touch me.
I wouldn't let him.
All right!

Oh, come on!

Come on!

Get on it!

You'll go down with him!

Oh, he's not goin' anywhere, mate, is he?
I promise you, right?
I'll get both of you.
- How?

You're a jumped-up customs clerk.
You're not a policeman's arsehole.
We'll see.

You're a disgrace.

You're a disgrace.
- No, you're a disgrace.

You scheme and fight, cut corners where you need to.
Then you find the best and most important thing in your life standing next to you in a Lebanese takeaway.
- Chilli sauce on that, mate?

- Give you a hand with those?

No, I know you're strong and you don't need help but, you know, we're both going the same way, so...
- You don't know where I'm going.

You live a couple of blocks down from where I used to live.
I'm not stalking you or anything.
I'm just, you know...
I've seen you about the place.
You're Roger Rogerson.
Yes, guilty.
Don't believe everything you read in the papers, right?
- Anne.

- Hmm?

She got the house, I got the trailer.
That's all right.

Look, uh, I might be getting ahead of myself here but, um,
I'd like to see you again.
Well, I suppose you'll find me.

Disgraced former detective.
- I don't believe everything I read.

- Roger.

Standen?

There was a time we wouldn't let him in the building.
Not his call.
- Times have changed.

Mickel Hurley.

He had him on a piss-ant little street deal.
It was leverage.

Work with him for a couple of months.
Give Hurley to Standen.

Operation Omega's still ongoing.
I was found innocent of the Drury shooting.
The word on the street is that
Chris Flannery might have had something to do with it.
You were found not guilty, and Flannery's disappeared, which is convenient.
We can still find assault, extortion, even kidnapping charges.
- Do that on your head.

Get Neddy Smith to roll on you.
There's not a court in the land that's gonna listen to Neddy Smith.
He's a convicted killer.
- You wanna bet?

Jesus, where did you two idiots come from?
I mean, did you get in with uni degrees or something?
Sociology?

Are you living at home with Mum?
I mean, I was doing this shit when you two were foetuses.
You're past your use-by, Roger.

You keep talking, I'm gonna pick up that phone book and give you a fuckin' master's degree in policing.
Charge me, all right?
Oh, don't bluff if you haven't got the balls to follow through.
Jesus, it's like amateur week at Pumpkin Creek.
Don't do this shit on the streets, or they're gonna take your little gun and shove it up your arse.
Fuck!
Neddy was an old mate, in for life.
Truth be told, he could have been in for three lifetimes.
- Who're you here for?

Neddy Smith.

Real good mate.

I tried to have him killed one time, but that was a misunderstanding.
What would you know?

You will always be on the outside.

Do you understand me?
The things you see when you don't have a gun.
Hey, Ned.
- Look at me.

Looking great.
It's this fuckin' Parkinson's.
They lookin' after you?
You're top of the class in medical school.
You probably don't ask yourself, "Wonder what I'll do.
Oh, I know, I'll be a quack at Long Bay."
Right.

Ahh, well.

You know, anything you need,
I can see if I can get you something brought in.
No.

Ahh.
We had some good times, didn't we, Ned?
Mixed.
Mixed.
Yeah.
- Ahh, you gotta laugh.

It's been a while, Roger.

They're looking at me for some untidy bank accounts.
Um, perhaps some other matters.
Could get ugly.

But that's over to you, really.
Christ, mate, I can barely remember breakfast.
What could I tell 'em?
There are some blokes you take an instant dislike to.
Saves time.
Glen McNamara wanted to be known as "Big Mac".
They called him "Little Burger".
Hey.

Where were you before?
Oh, the Shire, Cronulla.
I was in uniform down there.
- I heard National Crime Authority.

- Looking at police.

Just politicians, councils, that sort of thing, you know.
- And police?

Churchill's a good man.
So are the others.
- Yeah, I know.

_
Hello.
Get him, Crystal!
Get off me!
She's a bloke!
- She's got a dick!

- You loved it, darling.

- You want some charges laid?

You want some headlines?

- Call me!

One born every minute.
Time for a drink?
- â™ª Sex.

- Have you checked him out?

- Are you sure?

- Looks like a dickhead to me.

Well, an educated, guess, mate,
- he's a dickhead.

- I've got a feeling.

Roger.

Jesus Christ.
D'you wanna get in the car?
Get in the car.
Hello, Roger.
- You haven't got the balls.

You see, I'm not you, and you're not Christopher Flannery.
- No, I'm not.

Jed, you wanna take us somewhere we can do that?
If you want Mickel Hurley, do your job.
I'm not even here, Roger.

And it isn't about Hurley, except that it was you and Churchill who switched evidence for him.
So now that's what we've got Churchill for and I need Hurley to get him.
Him and your other old mates.
We are cleaning them out.
Now, instead of going after good coppers, why don't you do what they do, eh?
Go after some kiddie fiddlers, rapists and wife beaters.
You know what I'm saying?
You know, do what you're paid to do.
This is what I'm paid to do.
And nobody knows more about corrupt police than you.
Is that a compliment?
Oh, is that a joke?
You're such a smart-arse, Roger.
Aren't ya?
And why?

Maybe I will shoot ya.

Dump you in the harbour.
Can't be that hard.
- It's not hard if you've got it in you.

- Have you got it in you?

- with their hands out.

Or you're going to wear it.
We are cleaning out the Black Knights, Roger.
We're going to roll these people up, regardless.
There's so many teams investigating.
The Crime Commission, Internal Affairs, the Feds.

Hear that?
He's right.
So, there's one seat left on the lifeboat.
Now, do you want it or not?
- You think this is funny?

Why don't you shove your lifeboat up your arse?
Hey, tough guy, get out of the car.
Get out of the car, Roger.
Now.

You're a fool, Roger.
My old mate, Larry, thought he was on a roll.
What he didn't know was that he had two good men, and a dog.
Get on the floor!

On your bloody head!
- Don't move!

- Lie down!

Get up!

- Stay there!

Hey, I've arrested you before, haven't I?
- What, about five years ago?

- Where is it?

- All clear.

Right, piss these two off.

We'll manage from here, thanks.
- You want us to search the place?

Okay guys, we're out of here.
- Where's the cash?

Hey, Glen, wanna have a chat to him?
Go again.
It's in the fuckin' fridge.
- Hey, Sarge.

- About $12,500.

That now belongs to us.

Don't sulk, John.
Here's the good news.
You get to keep this.
- You're working for us now, mate.

Amphetamines.

- As much as I can get.

Glen here'll bring 'em to ya.

- We gonna split it?

12 grand?

There's a young girl there I had my eye on last time I was there.
Bloody hell, Larry, she's a bit young.
The reason she looks young to you is because you're getting older, mate.

Put 'em in a uniform and a big gun and 'whoo'!
You're a disgraceful animal, mate.

- Hey, Glen?

Maybe it's best to leave me out of this one.
Why would we do that?
You're in it.
Well, uh, this Dunn?
I don't know him.
You meet him, you pick up the amphetamines, you deliver them to Mancini and you collect the cash.
- It's a piece of piss, Glen.

Why can't Dunn give them to Mancini direct?
And then what, mate?
Right, it's like saying, "The cheque's in the mail"
and "Don't worry, I promise I won't cum in your mouth."
Look, you do your bit and you come next time, okay?
_
McNamara spotted us.
He's come into Internal Affairs.
It's a pre-emptive roll.
Right.

Well, he has to.

But does he know anything about Rogerson?
I'll find out.
Looks like Roger just missed the last lifeboat.
_
Hope he drowns.
You knew we were onto you.
That's why you've come in.
You're dirty.
What?
I'm not corrupt.

Right.

Why would he think that?
They left money in my desk drawer.
Uh-huh.
I needed them to think that I was one of them, so I took it.
What did you do with it?
- Spent it.

I was afraid.
They're in with Rogerson.
You're going to collect the drugs from Dunn and get him talking.

- No, no, no.

- Not Rogerson.

- No, you can't!

This is your get-out-of-jail card.
- I...

How're you doin'?
Remind me to do that to you next time.

- I'm sorry, sweetheart.

Not really.
No, I just...

- Spending some of your money.

Well, the thing you gave Larry, for the...
For the Hurley thing.
Jesus Christ!
With the baby formula.
You all right, mate?

- How's the... how's the body?

You all right?

A lot of beautiful ladies here'd be happy to give you a little rubdown.
- Thanks, Rog.

I've actually got a few people I've gotta...

He'll be lucky if Roger doesn't kill him.
Your mate, McNamara's, in here and he's wearing a wire.
And he's talking to Dolly and Fisk.
And they're spilling their guts.
- You sure?

- How bad is it?

You know, you might be better off staying over there.
Nah.

Oh, well, mate, we had some fun.
Yeah.

Nah, I'll come home, do my two or three years, then back here, happy days on the retirement fund.
Fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em.
All right, all right.

Out of the way.
Oh, here we go.

- G'day, darling.

I know where you bloody live, McNamara!
- Put him in the car.

- Well, that's the end of an era.

Leaves me a bit stranded.
These blokes were all I had going for me.
There's a slot with me.
No offence, mate, but...
I've always drawn a line with dealing drugs.
So do I. I import, wholesale.
It's business.

I'll be all right.
There goes your protection.
This guy's all self-interest.
He said he was gonna roll.

Internal Affairs are charging Churchill.
What about Rogerson?
We've got nothing on him if Churchill doesn't roll,
- which he won't.

- That's years old, boss.

- _

Any protection I had was gone, and it didn't take 'em long.
They got me for a couple of dodgy bank accounts, one up from jaywalking.
Three years for that.
Truth is, they were still sulking because I was acquitted of the Drury shooting.
- Move on.

Hurry up, let's go.
That way.
What you are is dirty cops and dogs and paedophiles, and you're here 'cause no decent criminal would tolerate you.
So turn around, bend over, spread your cheeks and cough.
You're a wannabe cop on, what, $30,000 a year?
I've already been searched.
Yeah, and by the time I'm done, you are gonna be Mary Rogerson.
Get back up.
Hey, Roger!

You're a dog, Rogerson!
- Come and take me!

You're in my spot.
You've forgotten me, haven't ya?
- No, I haven't forgotten you.

- I didn't have to verbal ya.

I need a piss.
Where ya goin', ya big faggot?
There you go.
Every day, every meal.
You can eat it or you can starve.
Fuck off.
- One or two?

How you doing?

What's the story there?
He owns the place.
Extortion, drugs, money lending.
Extortion?
Oh, he can kill your parole.
Send you back to Long Bay.

â™ª Silent night, holy night â™ª â™ª All is calm, all is bright... â™ª
Sorry, I should have checked.

- me being here?

Well, it's better than all right.
- Jesus.

Except ours were cooked.
I'm so sorry.

It's the best.

Did you declare that at the gate?
Um, yes.
They search you?
- No.

They should have searched you.
Stand still.
Roger?

Doesn't matter.
Look at me.

- Hey, mate.

- Are you here for me?

Jesus Christ.

Well, there's no need for anything.
Well, you want a cuppa?
Christ, no.
Don't do it, Roger.
Don't do what?
You do it in here, you'll spend the rest of your life in super-max.
Well, mate, it's gotta be done.
You're a lot of things, Roger, but you're not a fool, surely.
Nice and sweet, eh?

Can you get me some laxatives?

And some information I'll tell you about later.
Yeah.

And there's $500 in an account for ya, and I'll top that up
- when you need it.

- You got any?

Jesus.
Thanks.

You got enough yet?
I need a distraction.
- How long?

Righto.

Jesus Christ!
Hey!

You're dead, okay?

- Hurry the hell up!

- Hurry up!

- The Ironbloods?

- Ohhh.

Your leader, this Bronowski, is he ex-military?
Ex-Duntroon.

- Jesus.

Get out of the way.

- Get out of there!

- For fuck's sake!

- Why?

What's wrong with ya?
- Get off the gear, mate.

Let me go through!
No way, mate.
Get back in line.
Just let me do it!
What are you doing?

Stop it!
I'm gonna kill you!
These are you bank statements, mate.
You can keep this one.
I got plenty of copies, shithead.
And when I say 'shithead', I mean shithead.
Busted!
Cops use phone books because they don't leave a mark.
Not too many phone books in jail.
And sometimes, you know, you wanna leave a mark.
Ohh.

Eat that or starve.
â™ª Three little maids from school are we â™ª
â™ª Pert as a school-girl one can be â™ª
â™ª Filled to the brim with girlish glee â™ª
â™ª Three little maids from school â™ª
â™ª Everything is a source of fun â™ª
â™ª Nobody's safe, for we care for none â™ª
â™ª Life is a joke that's just begun â™ª
â™ª Three little maids from school â™ª
â™ª Three little maids who, all unwary â™ª
â™ª Come from a ladies' seminary â™ª
â™ª Freed from its genius tutelary â™ª
â™ª Three little maids from school â™ª
- â™ª Three little maids from school â™ª - â™ª Three little maids from school!

_
See ya, mate.

Hey.

I don't know where we are, so...
- It's nice around here, isn't it?

You know, we could...
I mean, we could get a little place around here.
Yeah.

- since you were away but, yeah.

You know, I don't even know what you do.
- What, for a crust?

Oh, well, I got a few tricks up my sleeve.
You know, I'm actually a very good welder.
It's true.

What was that?
Oh, Jesus.
Mmm.

No, maybe not the best.
Not too private, is it?
- You think you can wait ten minutes?

You okay?
Yeah.

I'm more perfect than I've ever been in my life.
- I wanna look after you.

Yeah, I do.

- Oh!

- No, I'm not.

Roger, the last man I went out with was still living at home with his mother, and the ones before that should've been.
You once said I shouldn't believe everything I read, and I don't.
But, um, I have to ask you.
- It's about Michael Drury.

Sorry.
No, look, it's... it's...

I don't want us to have any secrets from each other, so fire away.

Well, they say you shot him.
Or arranged it.
I had nothing to do with it.

He's given us this problem.
Moralising bastard's got no right to act righteous.
He knows what to expect.
I would never, ever do anything to hurt a cop.
You always said, "Never shoot a cop."
That was you, sunshine.

Michael Drury was a cop.
Now, I don't know what sort of blokes you're used to but, you know, it's like, with you, I'm...
I'm gonna protect you, no matter what.
Not so sure I did you a favour.
No, you did.

Give us a hand, mate.
So, the Ironbloods is national, is it?
Yeah.
Sort of like a network if you think about it.
Yeah, but the interstate leaders get hassled by the cops, so they don't meet very often.
Though I know what you're thinking.
- We're sitting on a goldmine.

Oh, come on, mate.

When?
Yeah, right.

Prick from the council.
He tendered for three jobs and he didn't get one.
Oh, thanks.
- You're Roger Rogerson.

- Drink your beer.

- I, uh...

I...

A bit.
What'd you read?
Well, you know.
No, I don't know.
I didn't read it, you read it.
- What did you read?

No, I don't know, like I said.
How could I know?

- What you read?

Was it?
What, killing Warren Lanfranchi,
- you think that was good, do you?

- No...

Or are we talking about the Michael Drury matter?
- You saying I was involved in that?

That's what you read.
That I was involved in the Drury matter, in shooting him.
Well, you know, fucking newspapers, right?
You're in the scaffolding business.
I'm sorry?
For the council.
You do the contracts for the scaffolding.
So you're in the scaffolding business.
- Oh, yeah, I am.

- You are?

He's a good bloke.
Yes, he is.
He is.
- Finished with this?

Uh, yeah, yeah, finished.
Oh, what's this?
- Well, I got a bonus, didn't I?

Well, I helped the boss out with a little something.
- Now, have you got a big frock?

- Big frock!

Come on, the shops are still open.

We're going to buy you a big...

I'm going to show you off.

- My god, Roger.

- Think I'm getting wet.

- Where have you been all my life?

Excuse me?
Sorry to intrude.

- Yes, I am.

Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thanks are nice, but you can't eat 'em.
I had some ideas, and some cops that still owed me.
G'day, mate.

Yeah.

Oh, Jesus no.

Miss this?

Bill, how are ya?
- Good to see ya, mate.

- How're ya goin'?

How are ya, mate?
- G'day, Roger.

- Yeah.

Great, mate.
- Good.

- How are ya, buddy?

I'm trying to set up a meeting.
It's no big deal, just to talk.
Uh, but I've gotta fly a couple of blokes in from interstate and they're biker guys so, you know, they need to know they're not going to be hassled, or looked at too hard, you know what I mean?
Fax us the details.

- Great.

No.

G'day, Roger.

We met at the Cross.

- Yep.

Scaffolding.
Well, uh, I'm doing a bit of, uh, freelancing.
Private investigations.
If you, uh, feel like working together, a partnership?
Well, I'm pretty busy scaffolding.
Just to be clear, I won't be vouching for you tonight.
Didn't expect you would.
G'day, mate.

We all know why we're here?
This is the bloke that got you through the airport.
You're gonna like him, Eddie.
Apparently, he's whacked a few blokes.
As you're aware, Alan did time with Roger.
He's vouching for him.
We're sitting on a goldmine.
Amphetamines.

Oh, yeah?

I'll tell you why.
Turf wars, brawls, rapes, stupid shit the police and politicians can't ignore.
I'm no drug distributor.

But, I've got a few contacts and I got a bit of influence.
So if you blokes can keep a lid on your shit,
I can keep the police off your back.
- We all make money.

I can.

You shot Lanfranchi.
They say you killed Flannery.
Arranged the Drury thing.
What sort of fuckin' influence have you got?
Ahh, well, I think you just answered your own question, mate.
- What are they gonna cost?

I take care of the police out of my end.
- Which is what?

That could amount to millions.
Well, you came to me, I didn't come to you.
You say it's a billion-dollar market.
- I say that's bullshit.

- the shit from?

- Roger's connected to Mickel Hurley.

If you bring Hurley in, if you can handle the filth, we got a deal.
Hurley's not going to deal with fuckwits and boofheads.

- You take care of your end.

$600,000 I have.

Looking for 610. 610 for you, Ma'am. 610. 620.
Christ, who are these shitheads?
I grew up in that house.

- 640!

Eight kids, one room.
...what you are buying, though, is blue sky!
What you see there is the future and it is coming right here!
Someday, this will be a hotel, apartments, a casino.
You will have Jamie Packer as your neighbour!
All you need is a lick of paint!
Shall we go in fives?

- 650. 650, I call. 650. 655. 655.

660, Sir.

- At 660.

- $700,000.

720.

- 750.

750 is the bid. 750,000...
- 800.

- 50.

- At 850. 850...

$900,000, thank you, sir.

- A million dollars!

At $1 million, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm mad, but I'm not that fuckin' mad.
Well, mate, I mean, do you want it?
I'm happy to go and have a little chat.
- A million dollars!

- It's a shithole.

Second and final call.

Come on, let's get a drink before you fuckin' kill someone.
Well done, mate.
Happy to renegotiate the terms of sale.
Look at this prick.
This is the biggest offensive for drugs...
He's gone up in the world when you've been away.
He's on a couple of hundred grand a year.
Oh, well, he's a rich prick.
Jesus, you can hold a grudge, can't ya?
Me?

Um, well, you mooned him that one time, gave him the finger, called him an arsehole.

Fuck him if he can't take a joke.

Listen, can we, uh, talk shop for a bit?
I didn't think you were here for that bloody auction.
I want another one.

No.

I've been speaking to Chris Bronowski, right?
- That biker fella?

- He's smart, all right?

- He's really smart.

No, yeah, but that's a good thing, right?
They've got a whole organisation, right?
- One more, Richie.

- Just one.

- they've got the works.

What they need is supply.
What they need's some bloody brains.
No, that's what I'm saying.
This guy... this guy is...

- He's one bloke.

He... he's the top bloke, all right?

He's on top of a bloody zoo.
They're apes.

Mickel, I'm...

I'm bringing you an opportunity.

What you're bringing me is a shitload of trouble.
I've got a nice little business, nice big business, nice low profile.
I deal with these people, I get in the middle of a turf war, suddenly,
- and then I'm collateral damage.

- what if he can put a stop to it?

You don't know that.
- He can.

Too many gangs, too many factions.
Too many idiots.
What if he gets the other clubs to agree to territories?
So he starts off with his own first, then brings in the others when they see how good it is?
All right, and I do this supply via you?
No, direct.
I just take a percentage.
I'm sure you do, plus a cut at the other end.
It's a pretty sweet deal for you, isn't it, Rog?
- Fuck!

I don't want to handle the fuckin' stuff, do I?
The fuck you think I wanna handle it?

- Fuck off.

Mate, you wouldn't be dealing with monkeys, all right?
You wouldn't be dealing with monkeys.
- Just... just Bronowski, all right?

- Just him.

- Hey?

- Fuck off.

- You can deal with Bronowski.

Mate, it's not what I had in mind.
I bet it's not, but that's it.
It's gotta be the deal.
Righto.
You move that shit!

- You move that junk!

You move.

Call the fuckin' cops, eh?

What's your fuckin' problem?
What's your story?

I can't understand ya!

- Hey?

- What are you doing?

You soil the fuckin' boys in blue.
- Quick, quick, quick!

- Oh, yes, Mr. Fuckin' Money Bags!

- Call the boys in blue, why don't ya?

- Ahh, bullshit!

- Oopsy daisy!

Christ almighty.
Good cars, these.

Bloody hell!
Jesus, that man can drink.
He held me down and poured beers down my throat.
You go to sleep, love.
Should've seen him.
Should have bloody seen him.
Did you know Chinamen float?
What do you think...

- A dog?

Oh, yeah, you want a dog now?
Well, what about this?
You find us a house to buy
- and I'll find us a dog.

- I'm just talking about a pup.

We need two houses.

Roger, all I want is this.

- And a little dog.

- Oh.

My men got into a brawl with them.
- Oh, Jesus.

My children were in there, so I don't care how much it costs.
- Find out who it was.

- Not the club, the individuals.

I want their names and where they live.
No.

- This isn't gonna stand.

This is exactly the sort of shit I was talking about, right?
You... you gotta show them you're different.
You gotta show them you're an officer, so you gotta act like it.
You're right.
Yeah, I'll talk to them.

- We do business, we make millions.

And while I do that, you talk to your filth mates, get their names,
I wait six months and then I kill them.
- All right, I'll get their names.

- Now I need to show my face.

- They did this to my home, Roger.

- It's my bloody home.

Those idiots at the Blackmarket, they're trying
- to take over the door.

- That's my job.

This isn't a war, is it?
I'm not even armed.
I'm just gonna show my face.
If you wanna make God have a little chuckle, tell him how you got this great plan.
That you're gonna solve your financial problems.
That you're gonna get rich, like all those other arseholes.
An internationally renowned bikie leader was buried in western Sydney today.
Over 1,000 mourners, including a procession of 500 bikers from around Australia, attended the funeral of Chris Bronowski, killed in an execution-style murder along with two associates in a Sydney nightclub...
Was he a friend?
- Yeah, sort of.

That's a delivery.

- There are more than 20 organised...

- Sign here, please.

... and analysts say it is difficult to determine whether an organisation is a social club, a gang or a criminal business enterprise...
Hey?
- Oh, Roger!

- Two dogs.

- Hey?

- Aren't they beauties?

Roger.

You're a little beauty, aren't you, mate?
Oh, my god!

... and they now fear a period of turmoil.
Reprisals for the killing could turn into open warfare, with one
- gang looking for revenge...

Ahh, no, no.
Sweet as a nut.
You keep looking for a house, all right?
So, what you're looking at there is potentially the largest drug distribution network in the country.
Any one of those men there could be a dealer, and on a perfect day, you could arrest a dozen of them.
Which would only leave 100 more just as guilty.
Turn it off, please.
I'm no longer with the federal police.
I've recently been appointed chief investigator of this New South Wales Crime Commission.
Some of you are state police, some of you are federal police.
Not anymore.

You are my people and I'm yours.
And make no mistake about it, we are in this together.
And under this act, we have been given the power to seize assets, to compel suspects and non-suspects to give statements with no right to a lawyer, no right to let anyone know that they've been brought in.
We've been given the power to use listening devices and phone taps.
We've been given the power to offer indemnity, cash rewards.
We've been given the power to create new identities, and we've been given these powers 'cause we're no longer going after the onion weed.
We're gonna chop the head off this snake.

Remember that name, Michael Hurley.
Now, this guy, he doesn't use a phone and when he does meet, he meets with a man by the name of Les Mara.
And you are gonna surveil them.

You are going to arrest them.
You are going to roll them.

You are here because I asked you to be here, which means you are here because you are the best.
G'day, mate.
Oh, it's perfect, darl.

Oh, no, yeah, it's great.
Yard for the pups.
It's probably way too much, isn't it?
Well, I don't know.

- you like it, don't you?

Yeah.
So, um, what sort of deposit would we be looking at?
You're Roger Rogerson, aren't you?
- Yeah, I am.

Look, I don't mean to be rude, but
I can't see anybody lending you money.
We'd be paying cash, you little shithead.
Well, I hate to say I told you so, Roger,
- but I bloody well told you so.

Those bikers are animals.

You're better off out of that one.
- Well, it leaves me with a big problem.

- Money.

- It's never a problem.

- Seriously.

- Roger... how much do you need, mate?

Well, how much?
Is your offer still open?
Of course it is.
Do you know what the problem with criminals is?
It's that they're criminals.
They're forever wandering off the path of righteousness.
I need a man I can trust.

Disgraced former detective.
This man is the only person that
I would trust with my life and now there's two of ya.
But if Standen gets a wind of this, you're gonna have to watch yourself.

Standen is a poxy little customs clerk, right?
No, no, no.
Don't underestimate him.
