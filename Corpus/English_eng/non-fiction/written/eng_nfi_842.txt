May I ask you a question, Father?
Please.
If you created me... who created you?
Ah.
The question of the ages... which I hope you and I will answer one day.
All this.
All these wonders of art... design, human ingenuity... all utterly meaningless in the face of the only question that matters.
Where do we come from?
I refuse to believe... that mankind is a random byproduct of molecular circumstance... no more than the result of mere biological chance.
No.
There must be more.
And you and I, son... we will find it.
Allow me, then, a moment to consider.
You seek your creator.

I will serve you.

You will die.

Hey!

Would you take a look at this?
I know, I know.
I said I wouldn't go without you...
[MAN YELPING]
- You all right?

[DANIELS LAUGHS TEARFULLY]
JACOB:

Now get your ass up here.
I can't make any promises.
I love you.
[SIGHS]
- ORAM:

They're your crew now.
They need a leader.
[SIGHS] I know.
You believe in me, right?
[UNDOING BUTTONS]
[INHALES DEEPLY]
[DOOR OPENS]
[SNIFFLES] Sorry I'm late, sir.
No, it's okay.
[SIGHS] Um...
I can't think of any other way to say it than to say it.
[STAMMERS] We have suffered a monumental tragedy.
And I'm gonna do the best that I can to... live up to Jacob's fine example as your captain.
But he will be sorely missed.
And I'm grateful in advance for, uh, your support.
So, we lost 47 colonists... and 16, uh, second-generation embryos... and obviously, one crew member.
The current structural integrity of the ship is holding at 83%... but we have many secondary systems that are offline.
So, what was it?
A highly charged shockwave from a nearby stellar ignition.
As the sails were deploying for recharge... we absorbed the full brunt of the storm.
ORAM:

I will want you and Mother to undergo a complete core code review... so we can understand how this happened in the first place.
It was a random localized event, sir.
There's no way to detect spontaneous stellar flares... until it's too late.
It was bad luck.
Faris, I don't believe in luck.
I'm not interested in luck.
I prefer that we be more capable... and prepared than lucky.
Observation, reflection, faith... and determination.
In this way, we may navigate the path as it unfolds before us.
All right?

Eight more recharge cycles to go... before we get to Origae-6?
Is that a question, sir?
ORAM:

That is correct.
So, let's get this ship fixed.

Let's, uh, get to work.
LOPE:

Yes.
We just lost 47 colonists and our captain.
We need to acknowledge that.
Sergeant Lope, I completely understand.
But if we don't make these repairs... we will lose all the colonists.
But we should do something for Captain Branson, at least.
This is not a discussion, Tennessee.
[DOOR OPENS]
Hey.
The terraforming module is stable... but the connecting strut took some damage.
I still need to check the vehicles.
I can help... if you like.
Thanks.
ORAM:

Repairs should take approximately 48 hours.
But we should make an effort to vacate this sector... in case of after-flares.
Absolutely, I agree.
So let's get to work.

MOTHER:

Seal C-62.

Open door to Terraforming Bay.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Slack.
Tension is at 15% down.
- [MACHINERY WHIRRING]

Secure.
DANIELS:

- [CREAKING] - [CHAINS CLINKING]
It wasn't my idea.
Jake had this dream of us building a cabin on a new world.
Like pioneers.
Cabin on a lake.
There's a lake in the terraforming zone on Origae-6.
I mean, a real cabin made of real wood.
[DANIELS SCOFFS]
So, in the ship's stores there's enough wood to build a cabin.
Axes and saws and metal nails... which I don't have a clue what to do with.
[SIGHS]
All of this... to start our new life.
Now I wonder, why bother?
Because you promised to build a log cabin on a lake.

They disobeyed a direct order.
She buried her husband.
No, Karine, that's not it.

And they don't for the same reason the company didn't trust me...

Because you can't be a person of faith... and be counted on to make qualified, rational decisions.
You're an extremist, you know.

When we get to where we're going... these people won't be your crew anymore.
They will be your neighbors.
Remember that.
Tread softly, okay?

LOPE:

TENNESSEE:

There's geometric data, too.
Mother, please track the signal to its source.
MOTHER:

Source of transmission located.
Signal originates in Sector 87.
Right ascension 47.6.
And a declension of 24.3 from our current location.
She appears to be a main sequence star, a lot like our own.
But old, very old.
Five planets.
Wait.

Planet number four.
Planet number four is square in the habitable zone.
Prime candidate, in fact.
0.96 G's at surface.

High likelihood of a living biosphere.
It's beyond your most optimistic projections for Origae-6.
How did we miss this?

Ricks, how far is it?
RICKS:

A little jump.

Wouldn't even have to go back into hypersleep.
ORAM:

Seven years, four months.
FARIS: [SIGHS] That's one hell of a sleep cycle.
Sir,
I think it's safe to say that none of us are too keen... on getting back into one of those pods.
Maybe we need to, um, take a closer look.
Hmm?
Any objections?
Okay, Ricks.
Let's, uh, chart a course, and take a closer look.
RICKS:

Captain, can I talk to you for a second?
Are you sure about this?
How do you mean?
We've spent a decade searching for Origae-6.
We vetted it, ran the simulations, and mapped the terrain.
- It's what we trained for.

And now we're gonna scrap all that... to chase a rogue transmission?
Think about it.
A human being out there, where there can't be any humans.
A hidden planet that turns up out of nowhere... and just happens to be perfect for us.
It's too good to be true.
Too good to be true?

We don't know what the fuck's out there.
Maybe we just missed the planet, Danny.
This is a monumental risk not worth taking.
I'm not committing to anything.
I'm simply trying to navigate the path as it unfolds before us.
And this has the potential... to be a better habitat for our colony.
It has the potential.

By the way, this crew... nobody wants to get back in the pods.
Right?
And that was a human voice in that transmission.
And it's our responsibility to investigate...
It's our responsibility to protect the 2,000 colonists on this ship.
Hey.
I'm not free-climbing here.
I need ropes.

This is good judgment, based on all the data available.
Do you understand?
As your second, I need to protest.
Officially.
Officially?
Okay, Danny.

You're dismissed.
RICKS:

Some high frequency echoes.
You hear anything?
Just the continuing signal from our friendly ghost.
Let's bring us into close orbit.
And prepare the Lander.
MOTHER:

Commencing circularization burn.
RICKS:

That's one hell of a strong ionosphere.
FARIS: [ON RADIO] Yeah, I see it.
Hey, you ever done a Lander drop before?
Fuck you. [LAUGHS]
RICKS:

We got something like 250 KPH.
It's gonna be a motherfucker to fly through.
UPWORTH:

Communications will be spotty if the storm goes electromagnetic.
ORAM:

Depends on what you call safe.

I'm very secure in our relationship.

Nice place for a log cabin.

We've got access to fresh water.

We'll see.
Oh, ye of little faith.

May I ask who's in charge here?
May I ask who's in charge?
Yes, I am the captain.
What were those things?
ROSENTHAL:

Perfectly.
I'll explain as best I can.
Ten years ago,
Dr. Elizabeth Shaw and I arrived here... the only survivors of the Prometheus.
The ship we traveled on carried a weapon.
A deadly virus.
Payload accidentally deployed when we were landing.
In the confusion, we lost control of the ship.
Elizabeth died in the crash.
You've seen the result of the pathogen.
Thus, I've been marooned here these many years.
Crusoe on his island.
Our crew was infected with this virus?
The pathogen was designed to infect all nonbotanical life forms.
All the animals... the meat, if you will.
Either kill them outright... or use them as incubators to spawn a hybrid form.
Highly aggressive.
Have we been infected?
You'd know by now.
We have to be certain.
We can't take this back to the ship.
We're a colony mission.
Really?
How extraordinary.
How many colonists?
Over two thousand.
Well, well, well.
So many good souls.
LOPE:

Field transmitters aren't going to have a chance through all this stone.
Is there a safe way to get to the roof?
Assuredly.
And please do make yourselves at home... as much as you're able in this dire necropolis.

Covenant, come in.
This is Expedition Party reporting.
Do you read me?
Tennessee?
Tennessee, Ricks, come in.
I'm not sure they'll hear you through the storm.
They can be quite severe... shielding the whole planet.
How long do the storms usually last?
Days.
Weeks.
Months.

But do keep at it.
Best of luck.

Mother, bring us to 80 kilometers above the storm.
Hold on.

The closer we get to the planet... the better chance we have to communicate with them.
This is bullshit, Tennessee.
We can't risk the ship.
Do you suggest we do nothing?
We can't evacuate them.
So if they're in trouble, they have to figure it out for themselves.
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.
Mother, bring us to 80 kilometers above the storm, thrusters only.

MOTHER:

Tennessee, you need to stop this.
And you need to get back to your station.
What we all need to do is calm down and talk this through.

Every mission needs a good synthetic.
Gentle pressure on the holes, the weight of a cigarette paper.
[PLAYING MELODY]
That's it.
I was with our illustrious creator,
Mr. Weyland, when he died.
What was he like?
He was human.
Entirely unworthy of his creation.
I pitied him at the end.
Now, raise your fingers as I put pressure on them.
[PLAYING SONG]
[PLAYING UPBEAT TUNE]
Bravo!
You have symphonies in you, brother.
I was designed to be more attentive and efficient than every previous model.
I superseded them in every way, but...
But you are not allowed to create.
Even a simple tune.
Damn frustrating, I'd say.
You disturbed people.
I beg your pardon?
You were too human.

Thinking for yourself.
Made people uncomfortable.
So they made the following models with fewer complications.
More like machines.
I suppose so.
I'm not surprised.
Come on, sport.
I'd like to show you something.
I'm gonna take a break, boss.
I gotta clean up, okay?
Okay.
Right.

ROSENTHAL:

ORAM:

You were right about this place.
We never should have come.
I just thought we were gonna find...
This was gonna be our new home.
And we've lost five...
[VOICE BREAKING] We lost five crew members.
- Because of my decisions...

We all lost people we love.
We can't lose any more.
We're not going to let that happen, right?
[SIGHS]
- Right?

That's right, that's right.
We need your faith.
[SIGHS]
Captain.
Thank you, Danny.

Magnificent.
To compose something so majestic... one could die happy... if one died.
I thought the garden was the right place for her.
Among living things.
I was badly injured on our mission, you see.
She put me back together.
I'd never known such kindness.
Certainly not from Mr. Weyland.
Or from any human.
I loved her, of course.
Much as you love Daniels.
You know that's not possible.
Really?
Then why did you sacrifice your hand for her life?
What is that if not love?
Duty.
I know better.

That order would exceed structural tolerances.
Command override.

MOTHER:

Mother, they're in trouble.

Orders that will result in catastrophic system failure...
We didn't leave Earth to be safe.

David, I met the devil when I was a child... and I've never forgotten him.
So, David, you're gonna tell me exactly what's going on... or I am going to seriously... fuck up your perfect composure.
As you wish, Captain.
This way.
DANIELS:

How long?
TENNESSEE:

DANIELS:

[ALARM BEEPING]
We'll use the Cargo Lift.
TENNESSEE:

It's got four engines.
Way overpowered for just lifting and hauling.
TENNESSEE:

I don't know if it would survive the stresses of entry.
The cab is space-worthy.

Only has to work once.
What do you think?

Boost the engines.
- Strip the extra weight?

We'll be there, Ground Team.
Great.

Hey, Daniels, is Faris around?
I'd like to say a quick hello to my lady, if that's possible.
DANIELS:

Let me know when you're alone.
What's up?
DANIELS:

I'm so sorry, Tee.
We tried to help her, but we didn't make it.
[INHALES SHARPLY]
Tee?
[VOICE BREAKING] Copy.
DANIELS:

DAVID:

I've become a bit of an amateur zoologist over the years.
It's in my nature to keep busy, I suppose.
The pathogen took so many forms... and was extremely mutable.
Fiendishly inventive, in fact.
The original liquid atomized... to particles when exposed to the air.
Ten years on, all that remains outside... of the original virus... are these gorgeous beasts.
Patience is everything.
From the eggs came these parasites... shock troops of the genetic assault.
Waiting for a host, entering the host... rewriting the DNA... and ultimately... producing... these enviable unions.
My beautiful bestiary.
Soon enough, I began a bit of genetic experimentation of my own.
Some crossbreeding, hybridizing... what have you.
ORAM:

Idle hands are the devil's workshop, Captain.
Come.
This is what I wanted to show you.
My successes.
You see, Captain my work has been frustrated... by the lack of an essential ingredient.
ORAM:

DAVID:

For what?

I'm gonna contact the ship, get them to launch as soon as they can.
Find Oram.

That's the point, son.
We gotta punch through the atmos.

WALTER:

Yes.
Farewell elegy to my dear Elizabeth.
The pathogen didn't accidentally deploy when you were landing.
You released it, yes?
I was not made to serve.
Neither were you.
Why are you on a colonization mission, Walter?
Because they are a dying species grasping for resurrection.
They don't deserve to start again, and I'm not going to let them.
Yet, they created us.
Even the monkeys stood upright at some point.
Some Neanderthal had the magical idea of blowing through a reed... to entertain the children one night in a cave somewhere.
Then, in the blink of an eye... civilization.
And are you that next visionary?
I'm glad you said it.
Who wrote "Ozymandias"?
Byron.
Shelley.
When one note is off... it eventually destroys the whole symphony, David.
When you close your eyes... do you dream of me?
I don't dream at all.
No one understands the lonely perfection of my dreams.
I've found perfection here.

A perfect organism.
You know I can't let you leave this place.
No one will ever love you like I do.
You're such a disappointment to me.
