He just admitted that he and St. Patrick killed Lobos.
There's nothing that ties that to St. Patrick.
I know Tommy Egan killed Ruiz, and I know the two of you killed Lobos together.

PROCTOR:

I don't know what other evidence they got.
Got something.
They think you killed Greg to protect Tommy.
I think they're gonna try and prove that Tommy is Ghost so they can prosecute both of you guys.
Murder one for St. Patrick.
- We're gonna bury him.

DOJ approved the death penalty.

Well, if they can prove that your marriage to James was really over, a business arrangement at this point, they may be able to break spousal privilege.

Angela would argue before a judge that you are now more of an accomplice than a wife.
She could force you to testify against James.
And if you refuse, she could prosecute you.

James wasn't home the night Agent Knox was killed, a jury would take that very seriously.

The LaKeisha Grant interview was productive.
