Yeah.

I don't like them either, but this war is bigger than us.

Even with the Blink Drive, we're more of an annoyance

Maybe not in the grand scheme of things, but at least in the lives of the innocent people affected by this corporate war.
Hey, I thought you were going to try

- It's very nice.

Yeah, looks great.
Don't tell me you called us up here to check out your new look.
I did.
But, also, after boosting long-range sensors,
I was able to discover a network of unmanned security satellites around Nova-17.
If we get close enough that the "Marauder" can make planet-fall, we will undoubtedly
- be detected and fired upon.

Not without taking significant damage to ourselves.
So that's it, then.
If we can't get anywhere near the planet, then what are we supposed to do?
What about Dr. Shaw's backdoor program?
What are you talking about?
She gave me a command code she had embedded in Dwarf Star's security protocol
- when she was working there.

But if they're using the same security program...
That's a big if.
Can we transmit the override command
- from out here?

The drone satellites are currently dormant.
They need to be activated before the override can take effect.
So the only way to see if it works is to get close enough to be screwed if it doesn't.
I can have the FTL drive prepped and ready for immediate activation if things go poorly.
We should be able to escape with minimal damage if the override command should fail.
Assuming the engines aren't the first thing to go, which they pretty much always are in this tub.
"Tub" seems a little harsh.
