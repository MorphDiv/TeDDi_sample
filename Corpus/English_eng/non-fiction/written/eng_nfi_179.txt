This Rontgen fellow, snatched the credit you justly deserve.
He's a rat, like the Jews.

It's only the very first Nobel, you will win the next one.
In this class we will deal only with what has been proven.
The existence of molecules has not.

A wondrous notion!
As a patent clerk, however, I must ask myself if this device can actually deliver on it's promise.
According to Newton, the answer is yes.
Absolute simultaneity is possible because, well, time is absolute.
And this all works if we're sending a signal from Bern to Zurich, say.

Well, everyone believes that light is a wave, yes?
Well, I can prove that when a light ray is propagated from any point, it consists of a finite number of energy quanta which can be produced and absorbed only as complete units.
That only took ten seconds.

Do you remember Philipp Lenard's paper on the photoelectric effect?
He demonstrated that light doesn't always act like a wave.
But he couldn't explain it.
Well guess who can?

No, well, yes, yes, but, no...
