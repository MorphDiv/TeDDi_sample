[Shiro] Let's hurry up with these repairs.

Okay, panel's off.

Very simple.

Could you be more specific?
[Allura] Sorry, Hunk, he means the poklones on the agroclams.
-No, that doesn't help.

[whirring, alarm blaring]
Uh-oh.

-No, not the smalters, the poklones!

What are you talking about?
-There.

The tech on this ship never ceases to amaze me.
It's so mathematically elegant.
Its fit is a 100 times more frictionless than any exoskeleton we have on Earth.
-It's... beautiful.

You're right.

Some genius engineer actually built this.
Kinda looks like a big, delicious curly fry.
[groans] What the...?
All right, we're prepared for this.
Remember your rogue projectile cluster training from the Garrison.
First, we need a temporary shelter.
[grunts] Wha--?
Oh, sorry, Shiro.

[growls] [chuckles] Like that?
Yes!

[all grunting, yelling]
[Shiro] All right, guys.
Oh, oh!

-[laughing]

-[Lance] Oh, come on!

Coran, I'm going to need a containment unit.
[Coran] Just a tick.
They appear to be some sort of hyper-resilient spore.
[Pidge] This bioluminescent pulsing doesn't seem natural.
It appears programmed.

-A code?

I mean, it makes no sense.

If anyone can figure it out, it's you, Pidge.
[Allura] Before that, everyone needs to come in for decontamination.
-[Hunk] Ah...

-[Hunk laughing] -[Lance growling] [screaming]
-[footsteps approaching] -[door beeping]
Keith, did you happen to see a mouse come through here?
He has something of mine.
Uh... no.
-I'll find you, Platt.

Do you think the Galra ever went to Earth?
Is that possible?

Oh, I think you'd know if the Galra were there.
The Blue Lion was there.

Hey, why are you asking about my lion?

-What?

You've had your eye on the Blue Lion from day one!
Well, yeah.

Ah!

The Blue Lion's with me and we're very happy together!

[Pidge] Guys!

[electronic beeping]
Oh, oh!

But, question:

What?

I ran the bioluminescent pattern through a variety of code-breaking sequences, including this homemade virtual Turing machine.
Of course, I had to make a few tweaks to the original design, because, obviously, there have been several advancements since he designed it.
Although, you have to admit, Turing was a shining light in the world of science
-in an age when far too many were still--

-[yelps]

Oh, yeah. "Under attack.

It's a distress signal.

Get those coordinates into the castle-ship's navigation system.
[Coran] The signal came from Olkarion, home to the Olkari, a proud class of engineers, builders of vast cities that could change shape at the whim of their creators.
[Allura] They had a seemingly magical ability to manipulate solid metal.
With just a wave of their hands, they could build a computer inside a block of steel.
-Whoa.

-What is it?

[laughs] Oh, this guy.

My name is Coran and I'm a gorgeous man.
[beeping]
[Coran's voice] My name is Coran and I'm a gorgeous man.
Why would a society full of literal tech wizards use spores to send a distress signal?
Who cares?

Actually, Pidge, the distress signal isn't coming from the city.
It's coming from... the forest.
[gasps] Oh...
Why doesn't anyone ever send a distress signal from a cool place?
[Pidge] I hate the outdoors.

I like it out here.

-What was that?

I don't know, but something's dragging my lion down to the surface.
[Lance] Yeah, something's pulling Blue down, too.
Are those wooden mech suits?
Are you kidding me?

[Shiro over speaker] We come in peace!
Could it be?

We found your distress signal!
-Praise Lubos!

[cheering, chanting] Lubos!
When the Galra attacked, only a few of us escaped the cities.
We were forced to flee into the forest.
-How long have you lived like this?

But, as you can see, our people are resilient.
We never stopped evolving.
Instead, we adapted our skills to the environment.
[panting]
Coran was right, Ryner.
You really are the most incredible engineers in the universe.
To be able to switch from working with precision machinery to a bunch of sticks!
Nature's designs are superior to any that we could devise.
No offense, but I'll take my computer over a tree any day.
You two can talk science later.
Let's assemble Voltron and get rid of these Galra invaders.
It's not that simple, I'm afraid.

[Olkari] Lubos...
If you attack, who knows what they'll do to him?
Then, we'll just have to rescue him.
-[over speaker] Work faster!

For a bunch of slaves with magical, metalworking powers, they're taking an awfully long time to build my super weapon.
Perhaps they need a little bit of motivation.

No...

-[gasping] -[sobbing]
That's more like it.
Um...

This is the armory.
Whoa...
-[all scream, gasp] -[Hunk] Huh?
-Cool!

[Ryner] Of course.

Now, the key to operating it is understanding that the nanocellulose responds to electrical impulses from the neural pathways connected through this.
-Do what now?

That's your interface?
Of course, all commands need to come as binary coded messages.
So, like this.
-Yes!

You must have a deep connection with nature.
Not really.

-Pidge is our resident tech expert.

Like the Olkari, you understand that, at the deepest level, trees, metal, you, me...

Does this mean I should start gardening?
It means you're going to need to give your friends a ride.
This way!

Finally, the cube is ready for launch.
Load the top Olkari engineers onto our ships and prepare for departure.
After the cube destroys Olkarion, hopefully, Zarkon will welcome us back to the main fleet.
[Ryner] Their headquarters are impenetrable from the ground, but there is one way in, a small opening in the roof.
It goes all the way down to an open courtyard.
That's quite a drop.
But there you will have total access to the building.
The hard part will be getting onto the roof undetected.
[Shiro] That won't be a problem.
Hey, hey, what's that?

My Lubos!

Hey!

I haven't seen one of those in many decafeebs.
We used to play with them as children.
But this...

Why would he do that?
They must have forced him to reveal his designs and reconstruct it as a weapon.
From the looks of it, I'd say it's almost finished.
Okay, we need to act fast.

First, we'll need to get to the top of that tower.
Since the Green Lion has stealth capabilities,
Pidge, you're the drop ship.
You'll take Keith, Hunk, Lance, and me to the roof, then drop back to a safe position.
After the drop, we'll use a censor to scan the building for any Olkari biorhythms.
[rapid beeping]
[moaning, sobbing inside] [sobbing continues]
[sobbing continues]
[Lubos] Betrayal!
[sobbing]
She loves you!

King Lubos?
Yes?

Um, we're here to, like, rescue you?
Hmm... [alarm blaring]
You could have just said, "No, thanks."
Looks like someone came to rescue you, Lubos.
You turned your back on your people to save your own skin?
I'm doing this for my people!
They wanted to fight the Galra, but they are too powerful!
The Galra could destroy us!
So, you helped enslave your people to build some super weapon?
Don't make me the bad guy!

Did he force-feed you, too?
Uh...
You're no king.
[whimpers, groans]
Okay, we're walking out of here!

-Whoa, K-Keith!

La-sai, what are you doing?
You betrayed our people.

You don't want me to hurt your genius engineer, right?
Oh, be my guest.

What?

Guards, put them all out of their misery.
[all scream] [grunting, coughing]
[Pidge] Your ride is here!
Engage the cube!

[all panting]
[both grunt]
[Shiro] The cube is operational!
We've got to get back to the other lions and form Voltron!
[Pidge] On it!
-[groans] -[Olkari gasp]
[Olkari murmuring] Lubos...
What's going on?
While your countrymen starved,
King Lubos was well taken care of by the Galra.
He willingly helped them build that cube, willingly helped to enslave his own people.
-[all gasp]

I know you're devastated, but it's time to be strong and use your Olkari spirit to fight alongside Voltron and take back your planet!
Lubos, how could you?
-I...

[Olkari cheering] [roars]
[roars]
[Shiro] All right, team, let's take that thing down!
Form shield!
Let's see how tough this magic cube is.
Did it just absorb our lasers?
We need to increase firepower!

-I'm not sure this is a good idea.

Yeah, I think it's working!
It's giving back whatever we fire into it, like Coran's echo cube.
That's what I was trying to tell you guys!

Making its own versions of our weapons to use against us!
[Lance] We can't just sit here.

[all scream]
[Hunk] How do we beat it?
Maybe, if we form our sword, we can cut through the surface and hack right into the center thinking point place?
Can't be any worse than what's happening now.
Let's do it.

[Pidge] It's working!
It's still operational!

[Hunk] We did it!

[Lance] Uh-oh!
[Shiro] We've got to move!

[grunts] We can't fight them like this!

Excellent.

Soon, I'll have both the cube and Voltron to present to Emperor Zarkon.
Let's see if I can freeze these guys!
Oh, no!

-Oh, oh.

Shiro, what are we going to do?
There doesn't seem to be any way to stop them, but we can't let this weapon get into Zarkon's hands!
-[screams]

The Green Lion's in trouble!
[Hunk] Pidge!

[groaning]
-[Ryner] Pidge, can you hear me?

-How am I hearing you?

We need to get your lion back up and running.
I think we can heal your lion's body, but you must bond with its spirit if it is to fly again.
-But I thought we bonded already.

Come on, girl.

Remember what I said.

We are all made of the same essence.
[Shiro] Where are you, Pidge?

-[all groaning, grunting] -[Keith] Pidge!
-[groaning continues]

-Guys, hang on!

[Hunk] Whoa, Pidge!

I'm not sure, but I feel more connected with my lion than ever!
I know what I have to do!
[roars]
Whoa!

That's right!

[chuckles] Vines...
Well, that is not the way I thought a giant cube of death would go down.
No!
Commander, we have to evacuate.
The cube is down, and the Olkari have taken back the city.
[growls] [all cheering]
I want to thank you all.

And, for that, we will never be able to repay you.
Just promise me that when it's time to take the fight to Zarkon, we can count on the Olkari for help.
Now and forever.
And you...

The bond between you and your lion has grown stronger than ever.
Without you, I would never have been able to unlock my lion's hidden power.
-[Shiro] Nice job, Pidge.

I've always been a tech junkie.

But, for the first time, I feel connected to everything.
I guess it's like Ryner said.

So, that means we're all related.
This ship, those stars, the Olkari.
Even the Galra.
Uh-oh.

-[all laugh] -[Hunk] What?
Well, that was a productive trip.

-Coran, Coran, the gorgeous man!

-Ah, sounds pretty good.

[makes fart noise] [fart noise echoing]
-[all laughing, gasping] -[Hunk] Whoa!
-[Coran] What's that?

-Oh, no!
