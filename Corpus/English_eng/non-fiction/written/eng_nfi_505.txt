*JUSTICE LEAGUE ACTION* Title: "Garden of Evil"
Batman.

I'm working on an antidote.

Superman!

The plants seem to be turning against the people.
I have a feeling Poison Ivy is behind this.
- Swamp Thing?

Swamp Thing!
You mean, you're the one behind all this?
No, no.

Uh, would you mind, uh, putting me down?
Oh, sure.

For good!
What's gotten into you?
Gee, I'm sorry, guys.
I'm a plant.

Swamp Thing!

You here to help out with the gardening?
Firestorm.

Wait.

Don't worry about that now.

Whoo-hoo!

Da-da-da-da, date, date!
Come on, man.

That's what I'm trying to tell you.
The blind date turned out to be Poison Ivy.
She tricked me.

Together we will pollinate this city and then Gotham will be ours.
I seem to be detecting some mixed signals there, buddy.
Whoa!

Be whoever you want, all right?
I'm sorry!

Ronald.

Oh, that clears up a lot of things.
We need to make a wall of nuclear fire.
It should dehydrate him without causing permanent damage.
Look at you dropping knowledge!
The heat is on!
Nuclear dehydration.

Just so you know, I'm feeling super-guilty about this.
No.

Hello, Gotham.

Who else could transform this decaying urban wasteland into a postmodern Garden of Eden?
I haven't just planted a few seeds...
I've rewritten the entire botanical code of Gotham itself.
All thanks to the ingenious work of my husband-to-be.
Together we will reign over our new kingdom of Gotham, with you as our royal subjects.
Gotham will remain our private paradise forever.
Yee-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Vixen, Superman, come in.

She's in the Kannager Building on Sheldon.
Vixen.

Ah!
Huh?
Whoo-hoo.

Heya, Red.

I have a new batch right here.
You have to give one to my husband-to-be.
Those filthy meatbags are weakening my control over him.
Oh, and make sure he comes back here.
We have a wedding to plan.
I'm on it, Red.
Ha-ha!

Whoo-ho!

Oh, no, you don't!
Boingy, boingy, whoo!
Ah!
Hee-hee.
Better luck next time, Beast-babe.
Huh?
Careful, Ronald.

So thirsty.
Hey, Sparky!

Oh!
You don't look so good, Swampy.
How about a pick-me-up?
Uh...

Oh, man.

You better get out of here before... the most beautiful woman in the world makes me destroy you.
Way to defend your woman!
You better get back.

I don't know what you're talking about.

I'm on my way, honey.
Huh?
Hey, Battycakes.

I'm on my way.
The formula's ready.

May I get the door for you?
I'll just turn it into a marshmallow and...
Mmm...

This is getting out of control.
I have to get this to Poison Ivy immediately.
Stay here and help curb the spread of the growth.
How?

- Improvise.

What does he think, I'm just gonna...

Hey, girl.
Honk honk!

We're feeding the whole city!
We'll need some benches over here for the guests.
Oh, and some over there.

And...

- It's over, Ivy.

Time to turn yourself in.
You found me.

Honey.

For the last time, I'm not going to marry...
Whatever you think is best, shmoopy.
I think I'll use both.
Ooh.

Why are you helping Ivy?
'Cause with the cops busy, I can free my old pals, Bud and Lou.
They're just dying to sink their teeth into a nice, tender superhero.
The one thing I know about hyenas, they're scared to death of lions.
Babies!

Do you think my hair should be up or down?

Nice hit, shmoopy.
Batman.

And you didn't come empty-handed.
An antidote for my shmoopy, no doubt.
But, as you can see, he's all mine now.
Isn't it time to get ready for the wedding?
Yes, dear.
Aw, so handsome.
- Hey, everybody!

Someone call for a weed-whacker?
Get him.
- Superman, now.

Ugh.

Ooh, Swampy!
Buddy, take it easy!
Destroy them, shmoopy.
I'm not your "shmoopy."
Shmoopy!
Shmoopy?

- Plants, get them.

That gunk blocks your ability to control plants.
Now everything will return to normal.
I'm taking Ivy back to Arkham.
Ah, yeah, here's the deal.
I'm sorry about that, but you told me to improvise.
Don't worry, Batcakes.

Wait.

What?

Batman's blind as a bat!
Did you guys know about this?
