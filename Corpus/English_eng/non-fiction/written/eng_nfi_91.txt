Announcer:

- Whoa!

- What?

I am vegan.
Made a big bang...
- Whoo!

Gordon:

- Well done.

Christina:

Rose to the challenge.
- While Sam...

Burnt on that side as well.
- And Eddie...

Crumbled under the pressure, ending their MasterChef journey.
- ( Cheering )

- Tonight...

Our first responders are arriving.
Justise:

I see helicopters landing.

- Start mashing!

The top 16 cook for American heroes and expectations are sky high.
- Hurry up!

This team might collapse.
That looks like a dog's dinner.
Oh, my gosh.

We are so disorganized right now, it's a joke.
It's like you've all given up.
Yeah!
Evan:

Welcome everybody.

Being in the top 16 is really, really amazing.
I'm just a small town girl from Georgia and for me, it's really, really cool that I get to showcase my cooking and impress Gordon Ramsay and Christina Tosi, and also impress young cooks who kind of like want to be in this position, too.
It's incredible.
Welcome back to the amazing MasterChef kitchen.
- Yeah!

Avani:

Eight-year-olds might be tiny, but their skill is huge.
You've conquered your first challenge to win a white apron.
You've mastered your very first Mystery Box challenge.
You all survived your first big elimination challenge, yes?
Yes, Chef!
There's still another first left... another type of very special MasterChef challenge, one where you will not be cooking inside this incredible kitchen.
- Oh!

It's time for your very first
"MasterChef Junior" team challenge.
( Cheering )
This is a big one.
Shayne, Adam, because you had the best dishes in the last challenge, you two will be our team captains.
- Yeah!

Back in Texas, I'm the captain of the football team, so I know how to lead a team to victory.
So I feel that this is a good job for me.
But if we lose, it's all on me.
Gordon:

Adam, you are the captain of the blue team.
Yes, Chef.
Adam:

I would much rather either dance or cook.
But I still think I can be a great leader.
Now, Shayne, you won the last challenge, so you'll get the first pick for your team.
Shayne:

The reason I am picking this person first is because I want my team to be as mature as possible.
And who's that person?
- Mark.

I'm really happy that Shayne picked me.
We both play football, we both hunt a lot, so we have experience in stressful situations.
I'm sure we can pull it off and win this challenge.
Now, Adam, big responsibility.
You are the captain of the blue team.
Adam:

I'm picking this person because they have a lot of good flavors and tricks up their sleeves.
Afnan.
Afnan:

And today, I want to impress the judges with my bold flavors.
Okay, Shayne, second pick.
They're awesome at what they do, and they're amazing at plating.
Mashu.
Mashu.

- Go, Mashu.

Right.

This person manages well under stress.
- Gonzalo.

I'm really, really excited and pumped for this challenge.
Even though I'm not captain,
I can show the judges that I can work well in a team.
- Right.

- I'm going to pick Evan.

- Right.

Gordon:

- I'm going to pick Donovan.

- Shayne.

Cydney:

There's not really a knitting team.
- Sydney.

- Peyton.

- Adam, where are we going?

Wow.

Uh, right, Shayne.
Your final pick will dictate both teams' lineup.
I am picking this person because she works well under stress.
Jasmine.
- ( Cheering )

Excellent.

- Avani!

Thank you, Adam.
Captains, please join your teams.

I think that Adam didn't make the strongest decisions, because my team is stacked.
- Lila:

Shayne:

As long as everyone listens to me,
I think we'll ease through this challenge.
Charlie:

But don't underestimate younger kids.
We may be tiny, but we're as strong as heck.
All right, I'm sure you're all wondering what the challenge is.

Yes, Chef!
Well, we're not gonna tell you.
- Aww!

At least not yet, because I don't want us to be late.
We all have a very special ride to catch.
So outside, our MasterChef carriage awaits.
- Let's go.

- Lila:

I'm a little bit nervous now.
- Mystery carriage!

What's happening?

- I'm so excited!

Oh, no.
I am worried about this challenge.
( Sirens wailing )
( horns honking )
Wow.
This is so cool.
I'm so excited that we get to ride in a fire truck.
I've never rode in a fire truck before.
It's beautiful out here.
I mean, I love all the mountains outside and all the airplanes coming though.
It's really, really amazing.
( Horns honking )
All:

Gordon:

Christina:

Shayne the train, good boy.
Come on down, guys.
So being a city boy from Queens, you definitely don't see any fresh grass or mountains because there are a lot of buildings, so it's good to finally be able to breathe in some fresh air after being stuck in the MasterChef kitchen for a while.
Let's go.
Red team, blue team, come on.
Did you enjoy that amazing ride here?
Yes, Chef!
Welcome to Cal Fire, the most active air attack base in the entire nation.
The fleet you see here is deployed throughout the state year round to provide aerial wildland fire support.
This is home base for some of California's bravest first responders.
Now we all love superheroes, right?
Yes, Chef!
Well, the people who are based here are real life superheroes.
They work every day to rescue people and to keep us all safe from harm.
And today, you're gonna honor them with an amazing lunch to thank them for their hard work and service.
Now, joining us for this honorary meal, we will welcome 51 dedicated first responders, fire fighters,
EMTs, police officers, paramedics... all men and women who put their lives at risk to protect this amazing country.
- Thank you!

Justise:

Both of my parents are police officers.
So today, I really feel like I'm cooking for my parents.
Each team will have 75 minutes to prep and cook 51 entr√©es.
Now the sides are completely up to you, but the protein we've already picked for you.
( Gasping )
Christina:

Filet mignon.

I know my meat.

I cook meat a lot.

I got this challenge.

Gordon:

Now, that's served with two sides and a delicious sauce.
Each guest will receive both teams' dishes today to enjoy, and after they've eaten, they'll then cast a vote for the dish they enjoyed the most.
The team with the most votes wins today's big challenge.
The team who loses will unfortunately be up for elimination.
Christina and I will be watching both teams very, very closely, so that we can identify which two home cooks from the losing team will sadly be leaving the competition.
- You guys ready to get started?

All right, your 75 minutes prep time starts...
- now!

Announcer:

- Okay, so, Mark, steak.

Mashu, Justise, potatoes.
Jasmine, Peyton, asparagus and broccolini.
- Lila, do a bacon sauce.

One, two, three, red team!
The most important thing with this menu is the steak.
Mark loves grilling, and that's his thing, so I'll have him do the filets.
'Cause if the steak's not perfect, then we're not getting their vote.
Get it going, guys!

Now, for steak, I want Afnan and Gonzalo.
Donovan, you're gonna be doing sauce.
Evan, you're gonna be helping him with the sauce.
- Do a red wine mushroom sauce.

Syd, you're cutting cauliflower and then dressing it.
Okay, we're doing gnocchi, okay?
Wait, what?
Right now, I am hesitant with this dish, because gnocchis are hard to make for a couple people.
But then for 51 people in a certain time?
That could make our whole team crash and burn.
- Ready?

- You got this, guys!

Wow.

Christina:

- It's not gonna be easy.

Gordon:

- Christina: 100 percent.

- from each team in the game.

Justise:

- You okay?

On top of this already tall order, we have chosen filet mignon to be the protein that both of these teams cook.
And you know, Gordon, it's a beautiful cut of steak, but it is not an easy one to work with.
You cannot cook it ahead of time.
- It does not hold.

It's a unique chance to see how these youngsters will cope under pressure with one of the most sought after ingredients anywhere in the world.
If you want to win, cook the best you've ever cooked!
Whoa!

- Are these the filets for the first responders?

Guys, you still have 65 minutes of prep time.
- Yeah, yeah.

No, no, no!

Filet mignon, it's a high end cut of meat.

This is really early to start cooking this.
- Okay, get them off, Mark.

If filet mignon dries out, it's the kiss of death.
Announcer:

This is really early to start cooking this.
Over on the red team,
Mark, the self proclaimed grill master, is off to a rocky start.
If filet mignon dries out.

Oh, my goodness!
Mark is from Mississippi.

That infuriates me, 'cause I know he's better than that.
Put 'em on!

- Trust me on this.

You guys need to focus on your sides and your sauces right now.
And then you can start this process in 25, 30 minutes, okay?
Put 'em... put 'em back in the fridge.
You have the 75 minute prep time and then you have service, and you want to be ahead of that.
You want to make sure all of your sides and all of your sauces are done.
- Yes, Chef.

- Everything.

- Right.

Give us an insight to your dish.
We're making a pan-seared steak with, like, a black garlic glaze.
If it was skirt steak or a cheaper cut like a rump,
I get that, it needs that help.
But it's filet mignon.
So if you're gonna use black garlic, go sparingly, okay?
Guys, don't use that much black garlic.
Gordon:

We're serving potato gnocchi...

- Say that again.

Are you guys crazy?
Gnocchi for 51 guests?
How many pieces of gnocchi are thinking of serving?
About 500.
- 500 pieces of gnocchi?

Blue team, do you have any idea how long that would take you?
- No.

- We'd still be here tomorrow serving gnocchi.

- Can we rethink the potato?

- Hurry up.

Change it to roasted, smashed, skin on.
Boil 'em, smash 'em, roast 'em.
We'll put it under the steak.
- Got it.

Thank goodness we're not doing gnocchi anymore.
Adam:

But we need to bring up the pace because we wasted a lot of time.
Yeah!
Listen to this.
Blue team, completely upside down.
They were doing gnocchi... 500 pieces.
They wouldn't even get the potatoes peeled in time, Christina.
- Adam:

No.

- and a tiny bit of butter.

- grilling fillet mignon.

Can you turn down the heat for me please?

Shayne, can you please turn down the heat for me?
If I say, "Let me do something," just let me do it, okay?
- Next time?

Here's the irony, we've got 51 first responders coming, and right now the emergency looks like it's inside the red team and the blue team.
Whoa!
Red team, blue team, our first responders are arriving!
Let's go.
Guys, they're arriving.

Hi!
My dad has one of those!
These first responders are coming quick.
I am just hearing sirens, and I see police cars coming,
I see helicopters landing, and it is like, "Whoa."
- Focus, guys!

These guys, and ladies, look hungry, so we need to get our steaks and every other food out ASAP!
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for coming today.
On behalf of Christina and I and the whole MasterChef team, it's an honor to be given the opportunity to spoil you for once for what you do for this amazing country on a daily basis.
Shortly, you'll be all receiving a dish from the blue team and the red team.
We hope you enjoy this incredible lunch.

Hey, guys!

Announcer:

Shayne, I need to hear you.

Cydney:

Start the steak!

Lila:

He's not talking one bit.
Shayne, how many is cooking steak now?
Shayne, how many is cooking steak now?
Cydney:

Shayne, where do I put the steaks?
- I can't hear you.

- That's not...

Red team, we're just shouting at each other.
We're so disorganized right now, it's a joke.
Shayne:

And it feels like my mind is just gonna go poof!
Shayne!

Lord, please, help me get through this.
Red team, our first responders have arrived.
And we're so disorganized right now, it's a joke.
Shayne:

Yeah, but, Shayne, you need to tell them what to do, though.
Hey, red team, come here, all of you.
Are you getting any direction form the captain?

- No.

So we need to sort out who's doing the steak, who's putting the potatoes on, who's putting the broccoli on, who's putting the sauce on.
But your team doesn't know what they're doing.
Have a 30 second meeting with your team
- and delegate.

Do it now.
Shayne:

I expect way more than what's going on right now.
Justise, Cydney, I want y'all to be in charge of getting the stuff up there so we can plate.
Peyton, cut more bacon, just in case.
- Of what?

Shayne:

But not only I have to step up my game, everyone else has to step up their game.
Come on, red team, pull it together!

Announcer:

Adam, thank you for helping me.
- Adam:

Announcer:

Wait, Charlie, what are you doing?
( Whimpers )
Right now Charlie is looking very, very pale.
He lost a lot of color.

I'm feeling pretty bad for him, because he's my friend and I don't want him to feel sick.
- I...

Can I get a break?
Adam, Charlie's gonna take a break.
Adam:

Adam:

- Hey, bud, how're you feeling?

I'm just really tired and hot.
The blue team is about to start service,
I know you helped out a lot with the potatoes, if nothing else even from here, just help cheer on the team and really just be of support as much as you can.
- Okay?

- Okay, how are you guys doing?

- What?

Let's go, blue team!
Announcer:

I am very hungry, I had a very small breakfast.
That way I can try this awesome food that's being prepared by these kids.
I'm really looking forward to it.
Guys, we need steak and we need sauce!
It is kind of unbelievable seeing kids in the kitchen, and that they have the skills to make such an accomplished meal.
We're really excited about it.
Get the steaks on, Mashu.
- I'm lucky if my kids can make some toast.

Man:

It's gonna be amazing.
Evan, this is what the plates should look like.
You just have to place them on and drizzle the sauce around this one.
Hey, blue team!

- It's time to serve, yes?

All right, guys!

We need steaks down here.
Announcer:

I'm bring out another batch of potatoes.
At the beginning, Adam is all over the place.
- Wait, wait, wait.

Hold on!
Evan:

But since he's just running all over the place...
- Whoa.

It's just crazy.
- We need 15 steaks.

- I'm gonna finish these off here.

Guys, make sure this is plated beautifully!
Announcer:

Lila:

I am really happy with my team right now.
We're firing out plates, and we're on track where I would like to be.
Good.

Shayne:

We're doing it, guys.

- How are you guys doing?

- Adam!

Announcer:

- Who cooked these?

Hey!

We're just trying to cook a simple filet mignon for some very important guests.
What was the sear I asked on the steak?
- Medium rare.

So we're serving them raw and rare.
- Do you want to lose this challenge?

Well, stop acting like it.
Captain, get some standards.

- Come on!

Syd:

This is a disaster.
Not only am I down Charlie, our team is falling behind right now, and I feel like this is all my fault.
Syd:

You guys, come on.

Adam:

Get more on at a time.
I am very stressed right now, because being a team captain is a lot of pressure.
Oh, my gosh, this is getting to me.
And I just feel like I can't do it.
- Guys, you gotta hurry!

Syd:

We're going as fast as we can, Syd!
If blue team aren't ready, servers, we gotta go.
We're ready.

Oh, my gosh, this is getting to me.
Announcer:

I'm dragging this team down.

But we gotta keep doing this, bro.

Right now, I'm feeling very, very, very stressed out.
Adam is lost as team captain and we're down one man and we're losing communication.
Guys, come on!
I definitely feel it's time to step up and take over.
Are these done?

I am a furious competitor, and I can definitely lead the blue team to victory.
So we'll do steaks.

I'm gonna do three.

Make sure those have already cooked all sides.
Come on, guys.

Announcer:

Get it going, guys!
- Red team, stop.

- Is that all the potatoes we got?

Announcer:

- Who's on the potatoes?

- That's not 50 portions.

I cut tons of potatoes and I told them to put them in the oven
- and they didn't.

- So who didn't put them in the oven?

( Chattering )
Hey!

If you're responsible for the potatoes, you cook all the potatoes.
I have tons of cut potatoes over there.
Can you get those potatoes in the oven?
And, Justise?

- Yes, Chef.

Lila:

We can't serve half the first responders potatoes and the other half none.
It's just not acceptable, and it's just not fair.
Are the potatoes in the oven?
I'm getting them there, Chef.
Quick as you can.

Announcer:

Those are gonna come out soon.
That one is raw.

Announcer:

Make sure those have already cooked all sides.
Afnan:

Afnan, focus!
You guys are on the same team.
There's no yelling at each other.
You're on the same team.
I'm trying to keep everybody communicated.
Communicating doesn't always mean yelling at everyone, to be clear.
Get that in... here, I'll hold them.
Get 'em in, get 'em in, get 'em in.
Gonzalo is doing a lot of screaming and no cooking.
Get three steaks in there now!
Afnan:

Chef, behind.

- Move!

Hey, young man, stop.

- and just cook, okay?

- How much longer on those steaks?

- so five steaks.

- We're doing that, Gonzalo.

Adam!

Hey, Gonzalo, you're just shouting again.
- Listen to your captain, please.

Keep it together.

Adam:

I really want to prove to the judges, prove to myself, and prove to these first responders that I can be a great leader.
Keep going, guys.

Announcer:

Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!
Good job.

Announcer:

Servers!
"Please." How about "please," young man?
Please and thank you!
Gordon:

Peyton, let's go.

Red team is starting to move so much faster.
All right, let's get the new steaks out.
Let's go, guys.
Plate this sauce!

If they don't like this, something's wrong with them.
We're just getting plates out faster than we ever have before.
It's awesome.
- Gordon:

- Good job, Cydney.

Okay, we need next six!
Announcer:

Christina checks in with the first responders to get feedback on which team's dish they prefer.
Now, I'm curious to get your feedback on the red team's filet and the blue team's filet.
I think both are cooked really well, but I'm gonna go with red team overall.
It's perfectly cooked.

I like the topping they put on it.
The blue team's was kind of seared a little bit tougher.
- Okay.

Good job on the steaks, Mark.
I preferred the blue team's filet.
Whatever the sauce was, it just really went well.
I got a little bit of tartness from the mushroom and a little bit of the thyme in the potatoes.
It kind of made the whole dish come together.
- Cohesive.

- Donovan, how's the sauce doing?

The red team looks like they're having some problems based on both of your dishes.
I think the flavors are good on both, but the red one is a bit rare.
Would you mind if I grabbed both of them and bring you a nice medium rare filet, if you don't mind?
- Sure.

I apologize.

Let's go, red team.

Standards, please.

- What happened?

- Oh no, oh no.

A bloody good vet will bring that one back.
Hey, red team.

Come on, Mark!
Do I need to call 911?

Look what we're going.

Of all days...

Come on, guys.

Look what we're doing.

That looks like a dog's dinner.
It's terrible!
Every single steak that we mess up as a team is a vote gone.
We need to make sure that it's medium rare and not raw.
- Do you want to go home?

That piece of crap there is fit for coyote, not a first responder.

If you can't give me that, then jump back in the fire truck.
Let's go, guys.
Okay, new plate.

I can't let Chef Ramsay or anybody else down in this competition.
I have to fix this, and I'm gonna make sure the first responders have good steaks.
Standards super high, okay?
You've all lost it a little bit.

Announcer:

I'm cooking these to 135...

Hey, guys, everybody doing good?
- Yes, Chef.

- Service, please!

Announcer:

Okay, guys, keep it up.
Adam is definitely taking charge right now.
He's being a good team captain.
Adam:

Gonzalo:

We're getting the steaks out.
We're getting everything done that we need to get done.
- Service, please.

We all feel like we got a chance now and we're doing great!
- We got this, guys.

Standards, captains, let's go.
Adam:

Guys, we have to hurry.

I really enjoyed both meals, but I would have to say the blue team took it.
The flavors were really robust and really zingy.
I couldn't eat enough.
We just need the last few steaks and we're out.
I'm gonna have to lean a little more towards the red team.
The steak was a little better seasoned and the sauce on the broccoli and asparagus was just really good.
Let's go, guys.
Shayne, Shayne!

Jasmine:

The blue team's filet was a little overcooked a smidge, but the flavors were amazing.

It was definitely worth the wait.
Let's move, guys.

Let's make these last steaks count.
Adam:

I have to say that the red team was my favorite.
I can't believe a younger person cooked the steak so well.
It's cooked like straight out of a gourmet restaurant.
Lila:

These last plates have to be amazing!
Gonzalo:

Come on, blue team.

- Let's go.

Service, please.

Syd:

Right.

Get some water, then clear down, yes?
- Syd:

Adam:

I need three perfect steaks.
Hot pan, hot pan, hot pan, hot pan!
Get the tongs.

Come on, red team.

Be generous with the sauce.

Service, please.
- Red team.

Well done.

- Thank you.

I am proud of my team.
And no matter what happens, we got everything done, and I hope that we have that edge on the blue team just enough to where we catch the "W."
Ladies and gentlemen, it's been an absolute pleasure having the chance to cook for this extraordinary array of guests.
We're honored to have served you real, true heroes.
Believe it or not, these home cooks are aged just between 8 and 13.
Please give our contestants a huge round of applause for their performance today.
- Good job, guys.

- Thank you for your service.

Right, ladies and gentlemen, could you please cast your votes?
Thank you.
Gonzalo:

These people are the people who keep us safe, and I think we served an all-American dish to the first responders, and they deserve that.
The first responders are definitely real superheroes.
Whenever someone is in need, they are always there, first things first.
And to know that there are people who care so much about others is really, really amazing to me.
Now, unfortunately, today, even though both teams did a fantastic job, we all know this is a competition, and there can only be one winning team.
And now the votes are in.
Win or lose, keep your heads up.
- Amen.

Gonzalo:

I definitely feel like maybe we did just a little bit better than the red team to win this challenge.
With 58% of the votes...
Cydney:

Even though some of our steaks were undercooked, our food tasted amazing, and I think that's what really matters.
Congratulations...
- red team.

- Good job, guys.

Red team wins!

- I wanna give you a hug.

- Good job, man.

Shayne:

It was a pleasure cooking for you.
I couldn't be more proud of my team.
- Thank you.

Gordon:

For now, all of you, clean up please.
- Thank you.

I'm sorry.
Don't cry, guys.

We worked our butts off.
Adam:

My management skills were sort of off, and I know I didn't communicate enough.
But I am very proud that we were able to get all our dishes out and be able to serve these first responders.
We did the best we could, guys, and the odds were against us.
Charlie got sick, and we were only seven against eight.
Gonzalo:

I definitely feel like he does have the right to cry because he thinks that he let the team down.
But we win as a team and we lose as a team.
Walking into the kitchen, being on the blue team that lost,
I feel bad.
I don't wanna get eliminated.
Line up, please.

I can't believe in our first awesome, epic, amazing, ridiculous team challenge,
I got sick.
Yesterday, you all cooked brilliantly for 51 emergency first responders.
And after all the votes were counted, the red team emerged victorious.
Unfortunately, that means, blue team, you'll face elimination, where we have to say good-bye to at least two of you.
Some of your skills shone brighter than others, and for that reason, I'm gonna call five names.
If I call your name, please step forward.
Afnan.
Syd.
Donovan.
Evan.
And Avani.
Afnan, Evan...

Syd... potatoes delicious.
Donovan, great sauce.
Avani, one of the best attitudes across that team.
If I called your name, it's because Christina and I believe that you five did enough to stay in the competition.
Please, all five of you, head up to the safety of the balcony.
Now, all three of you are incredibly talented young home cooks, but it is a competition, and sadly two of you will see your MasterChef journey come to an end.
Adam, big responsibility running that team.
When you have seven talented individuals alongside you, you need to delegate what you want from them.
Adam:

I feel like I should stay, because I've been able to show the judges that I have a lot of skill, and I can take this all the way.
Gonzalo, you were vocal, but not the captain.
You were saying a lot, but not actually doing a lot.
Yes, Chef.
I just got started, and I am not ready to leave.
I never got a chance to bring out my roots and my culture out onto my plate, and I feel like if the judges gave me just one more chance,
I definitely feel like I can show them that.
Charlie, for the limited time we saw you in the blue kitchen, it was hard to fathom out what you were actually doing.
I wanted to cook as much as I could, but I was sick!
If I felt better, I could have contributed the whole time.
Guys, this has been a tough decision.
Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that we feel that one of you has the potential and deserves to stay into the next round of this competition.
That person is...
Adam.
I'm gonna miss you.
- I love you.

Adam, please make your way up to the balcony.
Take your apron off.
So, Gonzalo and Charlie, we're really sorry to see you go.
You both brought so much to this competition.
I want you to hang on to those aprons and promise me that you're gonna keep cooking until you're as old as me and Gordon up here.
Both:

Hey, I've had a blast.

You guys are talented.
And I don't think it's the last time
I'm gonna see you two.

Both:

Both of you, come up here.
We're very proud of you both, you know that?

Okay?

- Take care.

Keep cooking, guys.

- I'm gonna miss you guys.

Even though I didn't win the "MasterChef Junior" trophy,
I definitely feel like I have won something in my life, which was experience, and definitely a lot of friends.
And I couldn't ask for anything better than that.
We love you.
Charlie:

I'm proud of myself.
I'm part of the top 16.
I mean, how many kids at my school can say that they've met Gordon Ramsay,
Christina Tosi, Aaron Sanchez, and Mayim Bialik?
How many kids at my school can say that they've cooked in the MasterChef kitchen?
It's safe to say that I'll never ever forget this.
