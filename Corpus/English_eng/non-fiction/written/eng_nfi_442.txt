Grr!
One chili dog.

Seems cool and edgy.

Here.

You know what?

Now I just wanna burn this place to the ground!
- Robots, attack!

We won't let you destroy Meh Burger.
Fine.

First, I'd like to say it's an honour to meet the man who owns Meh Burger.
Your institution is responsible for more evil
- than I could ever dream of!

But there's still room for improvement.
Orbot!

This is an artist's rendering of the current, inefficient Meh Burger.
Now, here's my proposal.

A shiny, new Meh Burger!
And a place where you get what you actually ordered!
I love it!

These machines will never be able to replicate the customer service experience that comes from a live employee.
- Could I get some ketchup?

I'm on my break.
Your business is very valuable to us, pink customer.
Come on!

We can have a contest.
OK, but if you lose, you're fired!
This is Soar the Eagle, broadcasting live from Village Centre where local flunky,
Dave the Intern, is about to challenge a series of robots in a fast-food throwdown!
Clearly, it's a slow news day.
The first event?

Ouch!

Next up, the Stop and Mop!
Mustard, easy!
Mysterious orange chunky goo, piece of cake!
Piece of cake?

Well, he earned that one.
And now for the final event, the drive-thru speaker translation!
This one's worth more points than all the other events combined.
That's to create false dramatic tension.
Or this competition would be over.
(Indistinct mumbling)
Two double Meh Burgers, and an order of humdrum rings.
(Indistinct mumbling)
- Uh...

And Dave goes down!

But at least they'll finally get my order right.
Dave, it's difficult for me to say this, but... you're fired!
Actually, that wasn't so hard at all.
In fact, I kind of liked it.
In celebration of my new good mood,
I hereby announce a party tomorrow.
(Cheering)
Enjoy your tin death chefs.
I'm off to the woods for something safe to eat, like unidentified plants, berries and mushrooms.
Gentlemen, today I was fired from my part-time, minimum-wage job.
This is an outrage!

Tomorrow, Meh Burger's going to have a big party and the Lightning Bolts are gonna crash it.
Here's how it's gonna go down.
Thank you all for coming to the grand reopening of Meh Burger!
In celebration, all cheeseburgers today are free!
(Cheering)
Aw.

I also hate gogobas.
Once our operative gives the thumbs up, we move in.
New intel!

Abort mission!

(Sighs)
To the new Meh Burger, where you get what you actually ordered!
(Cheering)
Not something wrong, served by a lackadaisical staff of slugs, who don't give a rat's patootie.
In fact, odds are, they served you some rat's patootie!
Our lawyers have assured me the percentage of rat's patootie in these burgers is well within the legal limit!
But we can forget those dark, old days.

Not me!

So, I'm going to exact my revenge on this so-called restaurant and all of its customers!
I'll break us out!
Ow!
The force field goes underneath too.
- We're doomed!

There's somebody outside the force field we can call on.
Hi.

If this is a threat or conspiracy, press one.
You don't have an answering machine.
'Cause I hate machines!
You were right about the robots!

You're doing an I-told-you-so dance?
- Maybe.

Sticks, listen carefully.
I need you to bring me some stuff.
A transducer and a beam-concentration nozzle,
- the big one, not the small...

Yeah, I got it.
A voltage bridge, a welding laser...
You can't keep us in here forever!
I know!

Wait.

Ta-ta!

Sticks here.

Right above you!
This is no good.

You'll have to take out the force field from mid-air.
You can borrow my plane, but need a co-pilot.
Is there anyone left in town who can fly it?
Why should I help save lame-o Meh Burger?
You and I have one thing in common, unless you also believe the government changes word spellings and replaces our dictionaries while we sleep.
- We both hate robots, right?

They took my job!
Keep your mitts on the wheel!
Don't tell me what to do!

It feels pretty sweet defeating Dave the Intern, Meh Burger and Sonic in one fell swoop!
And as an extra bonus, I don't have to wait in lines any more!
I wonder if these come in husky?
Why is there never anyone to help when you need it?

(Screaming)
First thing you need to do is slow our ascent before we get to the vacuum of space.
You'll have to disarm a couple of the thrusters.
Dave, we need to get closer!
Oh, that's really nice of you, but I'm kind of a loner.
Oh, you mean the plane!

Hey!

With half the thrusters gone, the rest are struggling against the weight.
They're gonna seize!

Time to even out my tan without fear of scrutiny.
Everybody, grab a table cloth.

Can I get another one?

Mine has a hole in it!
I need you to make an electromagnetic pulse to jam the force field's current.
- I don't know what that means!

You'll need a power supply.
Find something that looks like a battery with three squiggly wires coming out of it.
OK, got the battery!
Now find a beam-concentration nozzle.
It's like a small rubber traffic cone with a clip on the end.
Attach that to the loose wire and press the big, red button!
Nice going, Sticks!
Dive, Dave!

We're starting to get a little close to the ground here.
That sound is never good.
Aaah!
A perfect one-point landing.
Ugh!
Pretty nice of Mr Slate to promote him to Dave-the-Manager.
Well, he deserved it for helping you save the whole town.
A meaningless title, though.
He doesn't have any employees to manage.
Actually, I took care of that.
I salvaged one of the robots and reprogrammed it.
This is a salad!

I'm on my break.
