Not looking so good there, Milt.
Trouble sleeping?
I've been sleeping great, thanks for asking.
Clever, Mr. Gorski.
You mean, for a Chicago cop.
- I underestimated you.

Allow me to congratulate you.
He's kind of got this, like, sad, lonely dog look.
Is that your cluster?
That was the longest stakeout of my life and right now we're just kind of enjoying this.
You should.
It's a victory.
It's been quite a while since one of us has gotten to one of them.
He just said, "one of us."
You and I have more in common than you'll ever have with any sapien.
Really?

Give me some pound, brother.
If that was all I had, it'd keep me up at night, too.
Hey... we done bullshitting?
Good.
I know how hierarchies work.
I know there's no way that one of us is ever gonna be in charge of them.
Which means that your boss, Mr. Croome, is back there somewhere.
I want him in here.

- You don't understand.

Nom?

Okay.
His aunt is sick.
An hour ago, he sent "get well" flowers.
Chose the largest of the three options.
Classy.
Very.
Tell him... we hope his aunt feels better soon.
He wants me to tell you he hopes your aunt gets well.
- Oh, there's more.

Same florist.

Wife's name.
Claire.
Naughty boy.
Tell us about Rita.
He wants to know about Rita.
That oughta do it.
What are you hoping to accomplish here, Will?

No, hardly.
Guys like him... guys who live behind walls like this, they get the rules.

Told ya.
All right, Mr. Gorski.

You went to a great deal of trouble, Mr. Gorski, to bring us to this point.
Where do we go from here?
Since he can't hear me, we're gonna have to play a fun little game of telephone.
Repeat every word I say.

First... he wants a meeting.
- And I want it face...

Is that it?
- He wants it without...

I said every word.
- Nom?

I would.
What he's asking for is unacceptable.
- What's that?

I am the only advantage in this situation.
From my position, Mr. Gibbons, you've exaggerated your value.
- No.

The Chairman will hear about this.
Is that it?
I'm okay.

You did well.
Oh, my God.

He's gone.
Are you all right?
I am.
You were singing.
Was I?
Was it a dream?
Was it about getting out?
It was.
Hello, team!
Here's our man.
I'm feeling it today, man!

That's great, Lito.
I'm having one of those days, man.

Oh...
Check out this view, man.

I love the city.
We're so lucky.
So beautiful.

- Have a seat.

Hi, love.
Listen, I know Angels was a bit of a disappointment, but I'm already thinking about the new film
- and I have great ideas for the part.

Listen, he starts out kind of like a bad guy, but I think I can give him a bit of vulnerability
- so he doesn't look too much of a jerk.

What?
They decided to go in a different direction.
- I thought we had a deal.

There was a start date.
They're invoking the morals clause.
- There's a morals clause?

Look, Lito, it doesn't matter, okay?
The project was shit.
The director: shit.
The screenplay: total shit.
I thought you loved the script.
I loved what you were going to bring to it.
But the script itself?

Come on, Lito.
This is good news.
I mean, now we can go after another deal.
A better deal.
See, every year we say no to offers because you're too busy.
So now, we can say yes.

Here.
Take these, darling.

I'm sure you'll fall in love again.
Okay.
Hey, Lito.
You're still our guy, you know that, right?
I want pasta.
Carbs.

Flour and Water.
Oh, God, their pizza.
See, this is exactly what we needed.
A nice dinner out, remember what it's like to be normal again.
Prisoner 773, get your stuff.

Get your uniform.
- Come on, get up.

Come on.
There's my Angels!

- Thanks, Bug.

Nomi.
- What?

Help me.
Something's wrong.

- How do you know that?

Tasers aren't carried by any of the other guards.
She's in trouble.

She thinks they're gonna kill her.
The hell they are.
Bug?
We're inside their security system.
We've got eyes on you.
- Camera's down, got no visual.

Do not go in that room.

- Ah!

Bring her in.
Bring her in!
Ah!
Capheus!

- No!

Stop the car!

- Capheus!

Are you okay?
Pull her up.
Get her up.
Ah!
Are you okay?

Capheus!
Are you okay?
Shoot her!
I can't!

You stay where you are.
Help her.
Don't move!
She's bleeding!

Careful.
Are you okay?
Thank you.
When they took you...
I saw the look I used to see in the eyes of my husband.
He thought he could do what he wanted to me.
They made the same mistake like him.

No, they won't.
- Nom?

- You sure?

Are you all right?
Yeah.
You're bleeding.
- You're hurt.

- Those cameras are still down.

Got a few minutes before they figure out what happened.
- Now what?

- How's the alarm system override?

I'll make it sing "Born Free" if you want.
I am old.

That is not a threat to me.
I will take responsibility for this.
You can stay if you want.

Where you going?
Jailbreak, baby.
Jailbreak, baby.

Shit.

Oh, yes!
There's a bus.
Are you sure you can drive a bus?
Can I drive a bus?
What about the gate clearance?
- Bug?

Go with it.
I thought you didn't have a run until the late shift?
We, um...
Are you kidding me?

Since when did these fucking guys ever give us a fucking schedule?
That's the truth.
Oh, here's your clearance coming through.
- She... she's clear?

Really?
Yeah.
We just helped someone break out of prison.
- Yeah.

♪ As free as the wind blows ♪
- ♪ Free as... ♪

Is that it?
No.

- There'll be helicopters.

We should get rid of the bus.
Find a parking lot.
Agreed.
What are we doing?
Shopping.
Wi-Fi alarm.

Perfect.
Where did a banker's daughter learn to be a car thief?
Other lives.
Okay, let's go.
Now what?
- The city has the most hiding places.

Right, and her brother's going to expect her.
We need a place to lay low for a while.
Are you all right, dear?
When I'm nervous, I talk to myself.
Well...
I don't want to interrupt what was a very lively conversation, but I have a friend who lives not far from here.
Do you trust her?
With my life.
Move your asses!
Yeah!

He's free in the middle!

Come on!

Right!

Ooh!

Well!

Are you a Bayern man?
No, no, not at all.
No, I own several players on both teams.
I'm interested in talent, not games.
That's why you are here.
Would you like to have a drink?
- Sure.

- and I'll...

How about this 50-year-old Scotch over there?
No.
No, I'm joking.

- Nice crib.

And speaking of talent, allow me to introduce my extraordinary right hand.
I would be lost without her.
Lila Facchini.
Pleasure to meet you.
- Lila is Neapolitan.

Neapolitan.
Lila, would you mind grabbing the contracts from my desk?
Not at all.
So you're just going to sign a huge club over to people you barely know?
I made a promise.

You showed up.

I own a key shop.
I don't know anything about running a club.
The last owner never danced, he never drank, never partook in any of the reasons you go to a club.
- Sounds like a waste.

How do you run a restaurant without ever eating the food?
Boo!
I don't imagine you will make the same mistake.
Want to play?
Knowing me, I'd find much bigger mistakes to make.
I doubt it.
I see this as a tremendous growth opportunity for both of us.
We just came here because we thought you were jerking our chain.
I'm very serious.
If you give me a chance, I'd like to explain why.
I don't know.

Wolfie?
Hey, Wolfie.
Huh?
What you think?
Yeah, let's keep talking.
Fresh water!
New water!
Clean water!
Fresh water!
- Fresh water!

Hey, Capheus.
I'll take two.
Sorry.

- Again?

They gotta fill their pockets.
But people can't take it.
It feels like something got to give.
The competition lacks vision.
I'm not talking about just stupidity,
I'm talking about monkeys banging on typewriters.
They smuggle girls from Bosnia or some such place.
They rig football games.
Labor the margins with numbers and drugs.
Talentless chicken thieves with pickpocket ambition.
Have you played outside your cluster?
- Am I your first?

Thanks, darling.
Theirs is the old world.

It's tribal.

The new world is the interconnected world of global finance.
What is considered illicit today is commonplace tomorrow.
How can I feel you touching me if I'm not touching myself?
When you jerk off, do you think about your hand or do you think about something else?
I am something else.
Capital exists beyond the auspices of ethics, morals or even law.
Does it feel this real because we're so close?
It helps.
Money flows into this fine city constantly from all over the planet.
I'm not talking about a trickle or a stream.
- You have to want it.

Right now, it's a raging flood.
Hey, Wolfie, any idea what this guy's talking about?
Yeah.

Oh, you're good.
How big?
Billions.
Pretty big.
He's afraid that a gang war would be bad for business.
Help me and I promise to make it worth your while.
We might be interested.
- Cheers.

Oh, trust me, you will not find anything better at this price point.
Hernando?

- What?

Cars.
- There's cars in the room.

- Parking?

All our inside spots are already taken, but there's adequate street parking.
"Adequate." An appropriate word.
It... it looked bigger in the pictures.
Yes, a tiny bit.
You said you had one with a balcony?
Oh, yes.

Can we see it?
If you insist.
And, uh, how much did you say this one is?
Beyond your limit.

This won't be on the market long.
- Feel free to look around.

Yes?
Uh-huh.
Come.
- Come.

No.
- I love it.

Do you?
- Yes?

- It's ours.

- Twice?

Twice.
I'm such an idiot.
The first rule of acting: hold onto your money.

I acted as if the train would never stop.
- This is my fault.

I never carry my share.
- That is not true.

Lito, come on.

Two years ago, the Orozco museum offered me the job of curator for three times, three times what I made as a teacher.
- But you're doing what you love.

But you're doing what you love.
And that's important, right?
And I'm doing what I love.

Some... somehow, it's got to add up.
Oh, my God!

Oh, it's huge!

I mean, I know we haven't talked about it.
I mean, I don't mean...

You could have the big room and if I gave up my apartment, it would totally be affordable.
But I mean, no, I just realized...

I'm making this huge assumption and if you want, I'll leave.
Dani, Dani, Dani...
I think that the fact we could all fit in the tub... means it must be ours.
Yeah?

It's me.
You...
Come in.

Get in, get in.
Come on.
Croome said we could have an hour with Jonas.
I've seen no one watching or waiting around.
I think it's safe.
Why would Jonas pick this place?
I'll keep an eye on you from across the bridge.
Oh, my fucking God.
Yes, my new surroundings are less than salubrious.
I couldn't understand why they were bothering to keep me alive... until I realized you were still free.
How you managed that after being seen by Whispers,
I'm not sure I'll ever understand.
I know what manhunts cost.
I knew eventually someone higher up the food chain would hold Whispers accountable.
Well done.
Why'd you want to meet here, Jonas?
I wasn't sure if they'd try to trace me to our conversation.
Here, at least, you could disappear on any one of these trains, quickly.
There's train stations everywhere, though.
Why this one?
You are a good cop.
It was very different when I first came here.
But then, so am I, so... maybe this version makes more sense.
We forget so much more than we remember.
Maybe we need to.
Maybe that's what makes it bearable.
What happened here?
I had just got off the train... thought about getting on another... when I saw him.
Who?
My father.
What a mad, wonderful man he was.
He passed?
Cancer.
A rarity for us.
But he went surrounded by all his children.
Some 80 of us.
It felt fucking biblical.
So any gender can give birth to a cluster?
Correct.

This is one of the things that terrifies them the most about us:
potential population growth.
I read about this.
So how many of us are there?
Estimates vary from the thousands to tens of thousands.
- But rising?

- Why?

Epigenetic factors.
So, does that mean anyone can be born sensate?
No.
Angelica could explain it more clearly, but it's genetically encoded.
If it's a genetic disposition, does that mean Angelica identified specific genes?
I know you've all got a lot of questions, but shouldn't we prioritize a little?
I was.
I have quite a list.
Ask him about the rest of his cluster.
What about your cluster?
I am our last.
BPO.
Most of us, yes.

And what about Angelica's first cluster?
I'd never met anyone like Angelica.
I thought at first the sensate connection I experienced had something to do with the building.
I came back to try and understand if I was losing my mind, and I found her.
How can this be?
You're here, and I can touch you.

She experienced things with such... open, honest joy.
I can see them.
After the birthing, she was so happy,
I thought she'd float away like a loose balloon.
Come here.

But not every sensate is happy being born like us.
His name was Todd.
He hated what he was.
Please help me.

They can fix us.

- Todd, we are normal.

One by one, they disappeared from us.
The last one was the only one I'd met.
He was a reporter from Mexico.
Have you ever heard of quantum entanglement?
Particles respond to the same stimuli across huge distances.
Will you teach me to talk to trees?
He was just like her.

Raoul?

Did you know him?
I did.
He interviewed me a long time ago.
We had a connection.
I remember when he disappeared.
Angelica went to Chicago searching for him.
That's how she began working with Whispers.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I fear visiting hours have come to an end.
Jonas...

There's something going on inside BPO.

They are, like many of us in our institutions,
- going through an identity crisis.

I suspect Mr. Croome can answer that better than I.
What I do know is there's always an "us and them"
even inside a tightly controlled "them" like BPO.
I don't trust him.
But right now, worry about yourselves.

It's like you hooked a lizard inside the snake pit.
Croome may not be as dangerous as the rest of them, but in the end he's just as cold-blooded.
Jonas.
Mm...
Oh, my God, it's so good.
Mm.

Down in Busan.

I remember after I gave birth to our son, oh, you could say we were happy.
But...
But then, I discovered my husband liked to gamble.

Mm-hm.
Soon he was in debt to some dangerous men.
He lost the bar and had a breakdown and threw himself under a train.

I'm sorry.
Oh, don't be.
Now, I was in debt to those dangerous men.
They told me, "Take a holiday across the water in Japan, take a ferry, take your son, and take a suitcase.
Take ten of these holidays, and then we'll forgive your debt."
For nine holidays, everything went smoothly.
But on the tenth trip, when I got off the boat at Busan... police were waiting.
That's how we met.
- Mm-hm.

But after I was finally released from prison... my son hardly knew me.
He still feel ashamed of his drug-smuggling mother.
One day, he will understand.
And now, life is a big trap made up of little traps.
If you listen hard... sometimes you could hear them snap shut.
Rembrandt.
His name is synonymous with "masterpiece."
And this, arguably one of his greatest paintings.
An iconic work of individuals setting aside their differences for a common good.
Yet, in its day, this painting was ridiculed, called "a mess," "the work of an amateur."
There were stories about the gents who hired Rembrandt refusing to pay because they were unhappy with their likenesses.
The painting was so unappreciated that when they moved from one hall to another, they decided it was too big, so they just slashed chunks off the bottom and the side.
This amputation is what we have left.
And we built an entire museum around it.
What changed?
The painting is still the painting.
But what we see is not what people saw hundreds of years ago.
How we see changes.
The same is true for our ears.
The music of Mozart was not heard by the people of his time the way we hear it today.
Why?
Because our senses, including our common sense, are evolving.
And I think that is because of people like you.
If BPO thinks the way you do, why all the secrecy and control?
Obviously, not everyone thinks like I do.
What do they want that's different from what you want?
How much do you know about BPO?
Biologic Preservation Organization.

An incredible woman.
One of the great scientific minds of our time.
She believed sapiens and sensorium to be obligate mutualisms, dependent on one another for survival.
BPO was founded by her and dedicated to her vision of natural and ethical balance.
That doesn't sound like the same organization we know from Iceland.
No.
So what changed?
The same thing that changed for the rest of the world... 9/11.
The end of the Cold War mutated into the endless War on Terror.
And whether we're talking about spies or terrorists, sensates, by their nature, are a threat to secrecy and sovereignty.
Hm...
In that group of differing soldiers, there's only one pair of eyes looking to the flag, looking to the bigger picture.
Those eyes are the eyes of Rembrandt himself, hidden there, behind everyone.
His eyes are looking to the future.
And that's exactly where I'm looking.
There's a strong group of us inside BPO.
We believe we can change the present direction of the organization back to the vision of Dr. El-Saadawi.
What I want from you is time.
And trust.
These are psi-blockers, the same pills Milton takes to immunize himself for a period of time.
Consider it a token of goodwill.
And a down payment for a better future for both of us.
Hello, Will.
Ahh!
