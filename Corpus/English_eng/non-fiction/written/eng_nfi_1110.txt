No, you give me the Crunch Berries, then you get the remote, dum-dum.
No, I want...

- Give me five Crunch Berries...

Guys, we've got a problem.

Saturday morning cartoons start very soon, and all we have is this.
Mini nug.
Maybe enough for one hit each, tops.
So, if my math is correct, that's only, like...
This is fine, okay?

We need to figure out a way to maximize our precious resources.
- Okay?

Just be willing to try any angle.
Okay, so, let's try angles.
Try some angles...

- High.

We wanna get high.

Bermu-dope high-angle.
Bermu-dope high-angle.
Get me a marker!
Okay, so listen up, all right?
On the count of three, we blaze the little bit of nug we have.
- Yep.

Then, next sound of the shotgun...
Inhale, pipe from the left, we got a shotgun situation.

Okay, let's just get to blazing so we can watch PAW Patrol.
Okay, here we go, ready?
- Yeah.

Roast your bowlios.
Hold n, hold n, hold n, hold n.
Exhale.
- What?

My God.
Dude, is this for real?
Hola.

Dude, this is the next, next, next, man.
I mean, the hits just keep coming.
- I'm super high.

What is this for, like a dope party or something?
No, no, no, no, this is just us, what we do on a Saturday with my bros.
Smoking weed with my only friends.

I love you to death, man.

You guys are great dudes.
Is it cool if we get in on that or...
- Yes, please.

- Yes!

- That's awesome, man.

Like, they gotta see this.
Yeah, dude, more people, yeah.

I got a pocket full of rubbers, and my homeboys do, too.
- Wait, what's up?

I will, I'll spread the word.
By the way, it's Friday, so...
- Right, right.

- Right.

My iCal says it's Friday.
You guys said...
You guys said Saturday so...
Dude, we're supposed to be at work right now.
Okay, should we just go?

"We got a flat tire on the way", or, like, "We slept in."
Anders, it's not about flat tires or sleeping in.
It's about the fact that we don't get to watch PAW Patrol until 24 hours from now.

I'm fresh
You gotta, you gotta You gotta, gotta
Gotta be fresh
Dude, you just rolled, like, 30 joints in, like, what, ten minutes?
Yeah, yeah, yes, I did.
And I'm about to smoke five in ten seconds.
My God, dude!
- He continues to amaze me.

This is magic, right here.
Yo, um...
Can we, like, touch your hair or something?
Like, would that be cool with you?
Like, not to be weird.
Okay.
My God.
We got the beats
It tickles!

Gosh!
Do not do that again, please.
I'm kidding.

Argh...
What can I say?

A what like who?
Tom Jager, baby.
Here's a funky fresh sound
Okay, does anyone know who he's talking about?
- We are freakin' party gods!

Yo, dudes!
Are you guys drinking on the roof?
That's that next-next.

It is the next-next.

Yeah, man, it's just part of living that tight butthole life.
"tight butthole"!

Yo, I'm snapchatting this if that's cool.
Yo, these bros are my new favorite dudes.
They throw down, they smoke!
And they keep a tight butthole!
Tight butthole!

Tight butthole!

Whoa!
What...

Check this out.

Well, well, well.
You boys made quite the noise this weekend, lot of people think you're pretty dope.
Or should I say...

You could say that.
- We do say that.

My name is Kurt Fossil,
Marketing Director, Bango energy drinks.
We saw the social media blitz you guys pulled off over the weekend, and it was gorgeous.
We believe with our sponsorship, we can take your parties up a notch, and get rich quick.
My God.
Cool.

Yeah, that's my favorite way to get rich, yeah.
Wait, you guys, we can quit TAC and just, like, get wasted all the time!
- I'm in, sir.

My God.

I'm gonna mogulize my lifestyle.
I'm gonna be like...
I can't think of a mogul.
William Randolph Hearst.
- Paula Abdul.

Actually, I don't know.

I don't know if I wanna do this.
- Really?

I'm yanking your chain.

I'm basically like a human can of Mountain Dew Kickstart with hair.
Make that a Bangs.
That's a free can.
Plenty more where those came from.
He gave it to me. ls this free?
And just to show you we're down, this is a bucket hat.
I want you guys to share it.
- Whoa!

- Be cool in front of the dude!

Sorry, dude.

Looks pretty tight butthole, right?
Tight butthole!
Right on.

Shake that dick, boy!

10, 11, 12!
Yeah!

- Nice.

- I'll lift you up.

- Yeah!

Flex for 'em, Goons.
Get you some.

Hoist thy ankles, Goons.
Hoisting thy ankles, baby!
Yeah, he repeats everything I say.
- Yeah, you got this!

Actually, let's record this, right?
.Ok8Y- .Ok8Y-
Let's all start at 20 so it seems like
I'm better at drinking and then, um, we hashtag it "Bango"
on all social media, okay?
Ready?
20, 21, 22, 23,
24, 25, 26!
- Get it!

You didn't hit record.

- Go again.

Go, Anders!

You see that?

None of that bodysuit bullshit.

What arejammers?
Is that a fucking joke?
- No, no.

You're a fucking joke.
Can we watch the basketball game for a little bit?
It's game seven.
Looks like you're done for the night.
What?
You never heard of a boot and rally?
I just made room for ten more drinks, sister.
And trust me, I know what I'm talkin' about because I get paid to party.
You've been Bango'd.
I'm the daddy.

- Dude, this is so dope.

You like that?
Yo, so you're, like, weird?
Yeah, you don't just slam beers.
Like, you do all this crazy stuff.
Yeah, sometimes I slam the occasional beer and sometimes I just like to blaze up and get weird.
Let's get weird!
Let's get weird!
Yeah.

Bango slacker costumes.
Free when you buy a case.
That's dope.
- I gotta get one then.

- Hey.

Dude, you gotta wear one of those.

Okay, yeah, I don't really believe in a supreme being'.
I'm...
I guess you could say I'm more of a...
Eighth-eist.
- Like weed!

I didn't get it at first, but now that I do,
I'm in, like, in a way better place emotionally.
Yo, hit this, dude.
Okay, I mean, first time for everything, right?
Yeah, hit that shit, bro.
Hit it, bro!
Yeah, two hands.

Like a little piccolo!
See this guy?
Yeah.

- Dude!

Yeah, I'm gonna.

Everybody starts talking about you at the party, it's cool.
You know what?

- We should do it.

- We're going.

- Well, that's sort of my thing, so, um...

No, no!

No, you...

That's my thing!
That's my thing!
- I'm gonna do it too!

No, only one person can do it.

Don't jump that's my thing!
- Dude, are you okay?

So bad!
Hey, hey!
It's nothing a little weed won't fix, right?
I don't know.
Later, skaters!

- Actual skaters, baby!

See you, Chad and Derrick.
Good morning.
Dope party, fellas.
I'm so proud of you.
Bango is flying off the shelves.
You guys are off the Richter scale.
Death toll in the hundreds.
Thank you so much for saying that.

Yeah, man, it was awesome, but hey,
I got a couple creative ideas to run past you, all right?
- Sure.

Like, everybody dresses up like clowns or, like, post-apocalyptic.
Something like way out there and crazy, right?
We at Bango believe that the most "out there" thing we can do is to keep doing the same thing over and over again... .YeP- .Ok8Y- but on a web series.
- Are we talking business?

Isaac.

Isaac Lubetkin, Adam's manager.
This web series.
Are we talking a rev-share?
Because that's a thing I've at least overheard is a word for stuff.
Okay.
Gentlemen, we've built a brand.
Now we build an empire.
An empire!

That's also one of my favorite shows.
We build a set, we hire extras.
We shoot four scripted parties a day in a controlled environment, and then we drop a new party episode online every Friday, and the kids can party with the dudes world wiz-ide.
- On the world wide wiz-eb.

We are gold until we drop Season 2, and that's when the money starts rolling in.
Okay, yeah!
Hang on, hang on, hang on, okay?
'Cause my client's not just gonna keep working for a hat split three ways.
- Yep.

'My guy right here...

He is willing to work for three hats split one way.
I think I can get you one hat.
Hang on.
Psst.
Yeah, baby.
We can work with that.
Ders, Ders.

You're drinking out of a garbage can, man.
It's a garbage cup.
He's insane
The hell?
- All right, everybody, let's clear the set.

We're rolling in five.
Hello?

Yeah, I got eyes on Blake.
Morning, Blake.

What?

I got some email from Isaac, yesterday.
Evidently, stunts are exclusive to Adam.
That is correct, but we're still going back and forth on Adam's contract.
And honestly, your hair is testing better than Adam's dimples.
Yeah, so we think this is the best move for Party Gawds!
I don't know.
Why don't you just let Ders do it or something?
He's not in the best of condition.
Hey.
What do you say we go back to my dressing room, strip you down to nothing but that belt and fuck like the world's about to end?
Excuse me?
I was just running lines.
Okay, yo, whoa!

It's a weave.
Kurt wanted to amp up your look.
Make it bigger.

Okay, no, that's insane.
I look like a Mortal Kombat character.
I think you look cool.

What are you doing here, man?
I'm here to watch, man.
Bango set me up with a set visit instead of paying my medical bills.
Pretty sick, right?
- Tight butthole.

Um, so...
When are you gonna be walking again?
Like, a week or a month?
Never.

You know, I get to tell people that Blake Henderson saw me get paralyzed.
- I'm so jealous.

Stop!

Take the weave somewhere.
Yeah, his hair's perfect.

You guys, no, it's gone too far, all right?
You have to stop.

The partying, the clothes, the hair.
I mean, come on!

It's dead fingernails or something like fingernails, like, but on your head, like a horn, like a rhino's horn, which is also hair, I think...
- Don't say that.

Okay, no.
All right, you need to see this.
- No.

Look, it's just hair, man.

- No, no!

I'm doing it!

Don't!

It's just hair.
- Shut up!

It's not me.

All right.
Now that that's gone, whom is your Party Gawd now?
You still look incredible.
Hey.

- I'll be your Gawd.

Fine, fine!

Dude, there's no booze anywhere on set, okay?
- This stuff?

"Here we go, let's party."
Nope, non-alcoholic.

It's all fake!

I don't know what's real anymore.
- Jesus Christ.

We'll get him some water, some rest, I'll take care...
What happened to your goddamn hair?
It's gone, okay?

No, no, no, no, 'cause I'm sick of being used, all right?
I'm a human being!
- I'm not a goddamn action figure!

Action figure?

Isaac, let's do action figures, right?
- Done.

Yeah, which was, by the way, a terrible idea.
- I still like it, though.

- And that's why we're still doing it.

Goons, turkey bacon shake?
Turkey bacon shakin', baby doggy.
Thank you, baby doggy-
Kurt, I got great news, okay?
Contract is signed.
That means my boy Adam is ready to crush this opening stunt, all right?
Only deal is, he's gotta be in Slim Jim.
All right, everything Slim Jim, Kurt.
Top to bottom, it's gotta be Slim Jim, okay?
Blake's doing the stunt.
You, backstabbing, hairy assho...
Adam, I'm not doing the stunt, all right?
What?
- Your brand!

After all the exposure that I've given us with my SoCal Helpful Honda Center radio spot audition, potential forthcoming callback?
Okay, the what?
All right, I'm doing the stunt.
Excuse me.

You're not doing the stunt.
Well, newsflash, sir.

- Fine!

- I'll do the stunt.

- I ain't afraid to die.

He doesn't even have a brand.
Jager!
He doesn't even have a brand...
Shit!
That wasn't the stunt.
There's a whole thing with a Vespa and some silly string.
My God, Ders!
Did you do this to spite me?
I was just trying to kill myself, man.
So then, that's a "yes." It's a PR move.
- What?

Is that what...

At least Blake had a brand till he shaved it off.
He doesn't even have a brand!

You're a nice guy, and I plan on speaking at your wedding, but we are done professionally, mate.
Okay.

I don't have to do a lot of things, okay?
- Like be your guys' friend.

Another one of those things that I don't have to do is wipe properly because I have a guy for that now.
That's strange.

Yes, he wipes my ass for me, Blake.
It's part of having an assistant!
Good for you, Adam, but, you know, I have followers.
That kid right there, he tried to kill himself for me.
- That's pretty cool.

That's it.

You think you're so cool 'cause you got swag and followers.
Wow, great.
You know what I got?
Nothing, really?
You do not know karate.
- I don't know karate.

I never claimed to know karate ever.
Yeah, I don't think you know karate.
I'm not saying I do.

Hey, boys, come on, let's party this puppy off, or pretend.

You know what?
- Fuck this, right?

'Cause I'm done, so I will see you guys...
But I don't wanna be you guys.
Laugh harder.

That was...

Yeah, this, right here, I don't understand.
Why am I not the guy in the chair, right?
No, Adam.

I thought I was DJing at a sports bar called Bar Mitt Fuzz.
It's a bar mitt and there's fuzz in it.
- Bar Mitt Fuzz, baby doggy!

Please, stop baby-doggying.
Would it kill you to play another song?
Why, you don't like this one?
I think Asher Roth is tight butthole.
But not 12 times in a row.
No, the song's very tight butthole.
The more you listen to it, the better it gets.
- It soaks in ya, right?

Sorry, sir.

So...

Goons, laugh.

Stop.

Man, you're gonna talk to me?
- Well, Isaac, I do the talking.

Hey, bud.
I understand that you're branding yourself as a real man now.
But guess what, bud?
No matter how much you brand, no matter how much you work, your friends will backstab you.
Stab you in the back with a friendship knife!
Because they are jealous of your success.
And they'll betray you and steal the stunt.
I'm sorry that I'm screaming.
Mayim Bialik, everyone.

That's an actress.
She played Blossom, and she's on Big Bang Theory.
- She's Sheldon's girlfriend.

You're a good guy and I like you, and I still plan on being a pallbearer at your sister's funeral, but we're done, professionally.
Done professionally, my baby doggy.
Stop it, Goons!

- And you are fired.

And you are immediately rehired, Goons, because I need a ride home.
Hi.

Tight butthole job.
Hey, I was just wondering, maybe you'd be more comfortable wearing something on your head?
You want me to cover my head?

- Ls something bothering you about it?

It's not me, okay?

You know, it's just the people probably came here to, you know, see the hair and the cars.
Here, why don't you put on this?
Look.
Diaz, why don't you take a walk, all right, before I lose my cool.
Okay.

Yeah, okay, I'll wear the hat.
- Big fan.

Tight butthole.
Take it sleazy.
And...
Tight butthole.
Hup!

Way to finish, Corey.
Nicely done.
God, it feels good to be back on the deck, away from all the BS...

- Hey.

Sorry to be such a loose butthole, but can you get back to the announcer's booth?
The next heat is about to start.
Right, yeah, sorry.
Good job, Corey.
All right, and next, we've got the boys, 114,200 yard butterfly.
National record held by the Chas Morton, of course.
In lane eight,
Pat Heffeman.
Lane eight.

You guys ever feel like, sometimes you're in the lane eight of life?
Probably we all do.
Treading water, trying to keep your head above.
When we should really probably just sink to the bottom of the pool, open our mouths and
let the water end it all.
Nope?

In lane seven,
Brian Newman.
Look who it is!
Blakey, the loser, came crawling back to TAC.
Well, you're here, so, loser you, too, bitch.
Well, you're...

You're a son of one.
Yeah, that's right, I said it.
Son of a bitch, that means your mom is!
- No...

- You know not to bring Mama...

Stop fighting!
Because you both suck at it.
You're both losers!
- I hate you.

- I hate you!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's all this shouting?
I thought you were friends.
We are.
Friends don't talk like this to each other.
So, I don't wanna hear any more of this nonsense because I know you're better than that.
And guys, don't take what you have for granted.
Because you don't know what you've got till it's gone.
Yeah.
- Yeah.

Yeah.
Joni Mitchell never lied.
And Waymond never shuts up!
I was like, "Is he gonna stop talking any time soon?"
Rambling.
Yeah, fuck you, too.
I like him, honestly.
I mean, freakin' motormouth, but he had a point.
He did.
You know, guys, I think it's...
I think it's time we quit the show.
Okay.
What's up, slap dicks?

Water under the b-ridge?
Great.
'Cause tonight's gonna be insane.
- Back at the stage...

We're done.

We're not doin' it for the money, and we're not doing it for the Bango.
- Although we like the Bango.

You have to be joking.
You're gonna give up the ultimate gig of Party Gawds, for what, weekend warrior wannabes?
- Come on.

I respect that.
We had a great ride.

Take this Bango slacker wig.

Okay.
You want me to wear this thing.
- Smart.

- Hey.

Blake, no offense, but you gotta put that thing on.
You guys don't like this look?
You know, you're not that good-looking with it,
- but without it, even more foul.

- Yeah.

- That's a keeper.

You ever heard of "Puff, puff, pass," motherfucker?
Get in on that.

- That's real weed.

- That's real weed.

You know, I'm sorry about being such an egomaniac.
You know, I feel like,
I really learned something by having the show.
- Yes, yes, thank you.

The web series.

- Yeah, totally.

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

I love you guys.

I think the most important thing is that we just stay true to each other.
- Right.

It's like, maybe I take the wig off.
- Okay, yeah.

- Yeah.

- remember how I almost killed myself?

If you take that wig off, I will, I swear to God.
Yeah, if I learned anything from having the show...
Excuse me, web series, it's that you're the hair guy.
- You know, you are the hair.

- and a large jaw.

- You're tall?

- Thank you, thank you so much.

Yeah, that's the show.
We should have a TV show or something.
Nice.
Thank you guys, so much.
That's awrap.
And thank you!
Blake Henderson,
Anders Holmvik, Adam DeMamp!
