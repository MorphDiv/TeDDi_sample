Luda When I was 13 I have my first love There was nobody that could campare to my 
baby
And nobody came between us
No one could ever come above She have me going crazy Oh I was starstruch She woke me up daily Dont need no starstruck
She made my heart pound And skip a beat when I see her In the streets
