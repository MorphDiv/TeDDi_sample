Previously on Accidentally on Purpose
I'm thinking of going home with a guy significantly younger than me, and I just need to know if the situation is empowering or desperate?
- Is he over 18?

I'm not one-night stand kind of person.
I just never do things like this.
So this is the spot where we...?
Your first pregnancy test.
That's adorable.
My god, a nursery.
Shane did the bears.
He's better at skulls, but we went with the bears.
I really like what you bring to my apartment.
- You Want me to stay?

I Miss you.
You should miss me.
I'm fantastic.
Remember our boundaries conversation?
When you said "don't touch my stuff,"
I thought you meant your soy milk and computer.
No, I meant don't touch my stuff.
Baby?
Yeah, she's having my baby.

What?
I've got to update my Facebook status.
I assumed video figure skating would be physically hard.
I had no idea it would be this emotionally demanding.
Why are you playing as a girl?
'cause when I spin around, my skirt comes up.
I'd like to see that.
You got a tight little cartoon butt.
At first I wasn't really down with you moving in with pregnant lady.
This setup is so much better than my place.
No roaches, no mold...
It's a box.

Did you see that?

Did you see me stick that landing?
You look good as a small asian woman.
I think it's from your office.
It's from James, my ex-boyfriend.
He sent my stuff back.
All the little reminders that I purposefully left at his house have now been returned to me.
That's kind of a kick in the nuts.
That is the move of a true breakup master.
No Cds hitting you in the head, no chicks doing little chick punching.
This is how I'm gonna break up with my first girlfriend.
Dude, enough.
All I'm saying is, if she was remotely good in bed, he would have delivered the box himself so he could hit that one more ti...
- What the heck was that?

- Season 1 Episode 4 -

Subtitles :

He mailed you the box?
That is a work of a breakup master.
So I've heard.

Why can't I meet the relationship master?
So did you... open the box?
No, it's too painful.
The only way I'd be able do that is if I got plastered first,
I can't do that because, apparently, that's bad for the baby.
Mama loves you.
I understand your point of view.
There's nothing in your ear.
Had a chip installed.
I got your lovely box.
So we're good?
I'm glad that douche is out of her life, with his car and his man-Tan... package delivery service.
You are right down the hall from her and you're a good guy and she's having your baby and bang!

Come on, that is insane.
No, it's not.

I heard that dude was a playa.
Was.
Want to know what he plays with now?
His kids.
Don't stress him out.
She's not going to try to marry him.
She's just going to mold him into a boring funless drone whose sole purpose in life is to accompany her to the fabric store.
Shark week?

Peeing in the sink?

She's going to have your balls in a bear trap.
Other than that, you're good.
Wonder if James is already dating someone else.
Maybe she needs the drawer.
She probably has a lot of stuff.
You guys are great.
It's gonna be okay.
You know what?

In Pretty Woman, Julia Roberts was a frickin' hooker.
The worse it is the beginning, the happier the ending.
The gentleman over there sent you a drink.
Chills.
I had a terrible day, I got the box, now I'm moving ahead and a guy sent me a drink...

Holly... yes Batman.
I'm going to unbutton this button and go over and thank him.
What?

What if he asks you out?
You're saying it wrong.
What if he asks you out?
It's settled.

Look at her go.
She's giving him her number.
Hair toss, hair toss, and walk away...
He asked me out.
Get that snarl off your face and laugh like I just said something funny.
Are you at least going to tell him you're pregnant?
At some point.

I would really like to see that.
What about Zack?
Are you at least gonna tell him you gonna start dating?
Of course.
Now I am.
Do it with your top off.
I've delivered a lot of bad news that way.
I have got some bad news.
I... slept with your best friend.
Phil, your ipod fell down in the toilet.
They closed the chili's next to the office.
Zack, you have a minute?
There comes a time in every pregnant woman's life when... she has to ask herself... would Zack be uncomfortable if I started dating people?
I did not see that coming.
So, you're okay with it?
Look at you, bouncing back from the box, and in a way I did not expect.
Look at you, dealing with this in a way I did not expect.
This is working like a well-oiled machine.
Baby-making, but in a platonic relationship... well-oiled machine.
I've never dated a lawyer before.
You going to put me on the stand?
I'll put you wherever you want.
I'm glad I sent that drink over.
I'm having a great time.
Me, too.
What if you were watching a movie... about an incredibly handsome lawyer out on a date with a witty, effervescent movie critic... all of a sudden she says, "i'm pregnant"?
You'd watch that, right?
Are you pregnant?
Teeny, tiny bit.
Were you pregnant when we met?
Not as much.
He reacted very badly to the fact that I was pregnant.
How badly?
He was so anxious to leave, he walked into a glass door.
Which was funny, but...
Zack is with a girl on my couch, and apparently, she's telling him bad news because her top is off.
I'm Heather.

I sat you the other night.
Table 32.
I didn't recognize you without your name tag, which is normally on your top.
Can I see you in the kitchen about some important kitchen topics?
- What's up?

- I'm on a date.

When you have money.
Are you sure you're okay with this?
Because you're not acting like half of a well-oiled machine.
I am.

- Is that a real question?

Okay, we'll just stay out of the living room.

I just need to know something.
Does it bother this girl at all that I'm about to have your baby?
No, that's what's so great about this.
She thinks it's cool i'm sticking around, so thanks to you, i'm like a hero.
Glad I could help.
So...

Did you get to the creamy center?
- Very subtle, dude.

I took her back to my room and then...
You know how it's going to be the nursery with the bears on the wall?
So you're saying the bears talked you out of it?
Okay, first of all, I didn't say they talked.
And it was just that one bear.
The other one was kind of cool.

Did you eat one of those special brownies I left in the freezer?
They're not in the freezer.
You're making them right now.
Excuse me, time and space police.
I don't know, man.

- I just didn't want to do it in there.

I love having sex in your van.
Okay, how's this for my online dating profile?
"Slightly pregnant woman seeks mate."
For the record, I object to this whole thing, and...
How about this one?

And I think any guy who would want to go out with a pregnant woman is going to be weird.
And you should listen to me, because I'm your sister.
And I'm the only one here in a mature, committed relationship.
However, I will say that headline is adorable.
Yay, and done.

- Do you have a knife?

'cause apparently, not only is this box hard to open emotionally.
It's also hard to open physically.
- That's a lot of knives.

What you doing?
Looks like you're covering the bears.
You know those adult hotels that have those different rooms to have sex in?

None of them have the nursery room.
At least you got some action.
All I got was a handshake and a, "good luck with that."
It's hard to date when you're having a baby.
Yeah, it sucks.
This is a weird conversation, huh?
it's the first time I've had it.
Got it.

- Want me to leave?

This box contains the memories of the most meaningful relationship
I've ever had.
Yeah, well, just for the record, that guy's a giant douche.
And... go.
And...
Open the box.
See?

No, you're right.
Couple of earrings, half a deodorant.
Condoms?
My minty floss.
- Holy crap.

- These aren't mine.

Good morning.
Up or down?
I'm going down.
So... when I got that box...
Here we go
I was scared to open it, you know?
'cause I thought it was gonna bring up all of these emotions and regrets, like, maybe I made a huge mistake breaking up with you, but then, surprise!
Another woman's underwear!
I want to know.

Because if it did, you wouldn't have put another woman's underwear in my box.
- Can I get a word in here?

- First...

It doesn't matter.

Thanking you.
Thank you for saving me from a lifetime of finding other people's underwear in my boxes.
For your information, i'm going on a date tonight.
With a man.

They're yours.
We bought them that day in Paris.
Okay.

Whatever.
I am... how do you say...
Tipsy?
So, how are you?
Still all handsome and stuff?
What do you think of me?
It didn't work out between us but I'd never intentionally hurt you.
Youbroke up withme.
I guess...
Getting that stuff back just hit me harder than I realized.
- Hey, you want your underwear?

So, awkward high-five?
I hope this date turns out to be all you're looking for.
I have a good feeling about it.
So, about my internet date.
He's married.
And on top of that, his wife's pregnant, too, and we have the same doctor, and I asked him to leave.
Just plop 'em both down here.
And bring some ketchup, too.
I don't want to say, "i told you so," but I told you, so, good-bye.
Wait!

He ordered lobster and left, and you like this place.

I will take a pass on that.
Why?

Because, as I said earlier,
I am in a healthy, mature relationship, and I am having sex with my husband right now.
Okay!

Why did you answer the phone?
Because I've entered several sweepstakes.
I feel bad about the elevator yelling.
And I'm at that place we love on Filmore.
My date ended early for classy reasons, and...
I wanted to buy you a drink to thank you for buying me the underwear, which turned out to be surprisingly breathable.
What are you doing here?

- I was.

This van is great!
And...
No bears.
Anyway, Abby called, and she kept on saying,
"okay, all right," which was strange... but whatever.
- I thought you might like some company.

Yeah, okay.
So...
Your date left early.
I gotta tell ya, there's a reason why Julia Roberts was never pregnant and single in any one of her movies.
Turns out it's a lot harder to overcome than being a hooker.
Don't worry about it.
You are beautiful, and you're funny, and you got a cool job, awesome tv... insurance.
Any guy would be lucky to have you.
Well, in a stunning reversal, this has now become a good night.
To more weird conversations and fewer boxes.
To you buying me a new knife.
Seriously.

You got two desserts?
Shut up.
How long am I supposed to wait in the van?
This is some excellent food, pregnant lady.
That's just 'cause you're more baked than the food you're eating.
No, you can tell.

You know, like the kind of place that puts ice in the urinals.
I love peeing on ice.
It's like having laser heat eyes, but with your pee.
Did I say that thing about my pee out loud, or just think it?
You just thought it.
Wait a minute.

Ask us what?
Are we talking right now?
Seriously, can anyone hear me?
