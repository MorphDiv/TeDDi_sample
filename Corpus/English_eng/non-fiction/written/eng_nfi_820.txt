- Here comes classic.

Yeah!
- Coming up,

We could throw it a proper.
St. Louis homecoming.
We'll be serving up

I'm looking for a car.
That I can drive really fast.
And power.
But this british 1962 triumph.
Has a long way to go.
My son took an.
Auto mechanics class.
That just terrifies me.
And our 1966
Chevy c10 shop truck.
- Might not make it.

Come on, girl.
- Hold on.

- But we're gonna.

Let's make it shoot flames.
And you'll love the menu.
- This is like.

- But can we get these.

Ready for the main event?
- Little car,

Sorry, guys.
I couldn't hardly believe that,
That was my car.
Making a car look good,
For us, that's a given.
Making a car perform,
That's our specialty.
Here at classic car studio,
My team of visionaries.
And master craftsmen take cars.
Of all kinds and transform them.
Into customtailored.
Highperformance rides.
You want to win shows?
Go somewhere else.
You want to win.
Shows and haul ass?
We're the shop for you, because.
Here, speed is the new black.
- Captions paid for by.

So, today, I have a client.
Bringing in his triumph tr3b.
Now, we don't usually see a lot.
Of british cars around here,
Change of pace for us.
How you doing?
- Hey, are you noah?

- Nice to meet you.

-

- Yeah, absolutely.

- Thanks for bringing.

You're welcome.
- It is absolutely.

- Let's bring it inside, real.

You got it.
The triumph tr3b.
Was made in england in 1962.
They had a fourcylinder, 2.1liter engine,
Made a little bit over 100.
Horsepower and actually went,
Claimed 110 miles per hour.
So, they were a fast.
Little car in their day.
About the furthest I've gone.
In this car in a long time.
- This is actually.

- They only made a couple.

And I think we're gonna have.
A good time with the build.
Tell me about your history.
With this tr3b.
I tell you.
- This has just been.

I just wish I had.
More time in the car.
- What kind of shape was this car.

Well, when I first bought.
The car, the car was white.
And my son took an auto.
Mechanics class in high school.
- I can see.

- And so, that was it,

- The car was completely.

The frame was actually up.
Against the wall of the garage.
It had some issues.
With body parts fitting.
I always get a little scared.
When I hear a client worked.
- On his own car.

But when I hear a kid.
Worked on the car.
While he was still.
In auto repair class,
That just terrifies me.
After about 15 years,
I thought,
- "We need to do.

- Does that put us.

- We put it to this color.

- But this is not.

- Okay.

- But so we're gonna get.

In just a minute, okay?
So, this little triumph has.
Actually lived quite the life.
It took dale about 30 minutes to.
Run me through all the history.
I think we're.
At four body shops,
Three paint jobs,
And one horrific accident.
Before it rolled through.
The doors today, so, welcome.
Welcome, triumph.
We'll take care of you.
Are you looking to change.
The look, the performance?
- Well,

I'm looking for.
A very spirited car,
- A car that I can.

- Fast?

All right.
- I mean, I heard.

-

- We're gonna make.

When you drive a classic car,
You literally feel the road.
With new cars today,
They're buffered,
- And you don't.

To feel that road,
To feel the engine,
And to hear it.
And again, it's a feeling.
That you don't forget.
These cars always had.
A great race history,
Lots of performance.
Would you be interested.
In doing supercharger on it?
Yeah, yeah.
- I think I want to kind.

Back into this model.
We can take the windshield.
And change the windshield.
To the smaller,
Single windscreens.
Do you think a single.
Windscreen or two bubbles?
- I think two bubbles.

And I would like to make.
The paint a little more flashy.
- Yeah, - -maybe a pearlescence gray?
- Yeah.

And add a stripe to it.
- I think that could.

- So the tr3 had.

Much more expensive cars,
Like astons and jags,
- For just a fraction.

- So, I think,

On the performance end,
- You know, we can turn this into.

Dale's been trying to get to.
This whole time.
I'll kind of get some different.
Paint samples going for you.
And figure out what kind.
Of stripe we're gonna use.
After we check out.
The suspension and the brakes,
I'll report back.
- And kind of let you know.

- Sounds great.

All right.
Thank you, noah.

There you go, scott.
- After meeting with dale, I got.

- To make this thing.

But first, I want to talk.
To charles and scott.
And see what kind of ideas.
They can come up with.
I told you we were gonna do.
Your favorite car soon,
And here it is.
- What is this?

- This is a triumph...

- -...

- Little classic.

What is this car?
- Triumph, to me,

It's actually

- Walking out to the car,

- That we were playing.

Because we haven't worked.
On a lot of british cars,
- Yet he's in on this.

- Scott likes his pie.

And his cars to be.
Slammed down c10 pickup trucks,
So he's gonna have to suck it.
Up and work on this triumph.
No disrespect

- Everybody likes.

- But I think I see.

To the test on this one.
It's still a triumph when we're.
Done, so I'm still wondering...
Is this car a joke?
- Are we really supposed to make.

The guy's a car nut.
He's got, like, 10 little british cars.
The guy's a nut, but I don't.
Know about car nut.
- After he got.

- He was driving down.

And he tboned.
A suburban,
Broke both

And ended up.
In the hospital for a while,
And totaled

- So, then, it was.

- But he's not feeling it.

What he actually wants.
Is a faster car.
What's a faster?
He wants

- To drive through wine.

I mean, what?

A full door for the guy.
- So he don't fall out.

Give him what he wants.
- If you lower the car anymore,

- To his ankles.

And you already said.
He broke his legs.
I'm just having.
Trouble visualizing.
Help me out.
- Steer me right.

Vintage racecar style.
So, on the front end, take off.
These little bumperettes,
Two oldschool

Chopping the windshield.
Right here,
Two little speed bumps.
On the interior,
Higher back seats.
To run some harnesses.
For this guy.
- We don't want him.

And back of that,
Roll bar.
I think we're

It'll be low and sleek,
And no matter what scott says,
Nobody gives a.
This guy's gonna love it.
And he'll be hauling ass.
Down his twisty wine road.
With a smile

- And hopefully, no one turns.

- We're doing something.

With the wheels...
Out and make them look mean.
Lower it.
At least an inch or 2.
I think it will.
Look freaking tough.
- Supercharger will add.

- And then, we just got to nut.

- And make sure.

-

This might be the car that gets.
To scott's sensitive car side.
This might be, like,
His big breakthrough.
Yeah, pearl pink.
With lollipop on the side.
And cotton candy.
Interior.
- We're asking you to think.

Can you do that?
- This is one you'll probably.

To do what

- Well, I might just cut.

Let's go.
All right.
All right, shrek.
- I've never.

Me neither.
- So, this triumph has had so much.

In so many different places.
- We've got to get it.

To see what's lurking.
Under the surface.
- I think we're getting ready.

A triumph.
Asswhooping.
Yeah.
There you go.
- We usually do a lot.

So I'm always welcome.
Something new, a new challenge.
I think it's good for the guys.
To mix it up a little bit.
There she is.
- Dude, hey.

Well, look at the - light?
They're all soldered on.
Got it.
There's screws all through here.
- Like, they're.

- Some are standard.

That's bad news, really.
More backyard.
Three hours, and we got.
One flipping piece off.
I just hope we've still.
Got a job after this.
All right!
This should have been off.
A halfhour ago.
- So, now that the triumph.

- I'm gonna send it.

- So they can strip down.

- It's time to get this.

And see what else we find.
Well, I started stripping.
Some of the paint off the car,
Getting into it,
And found a lot of bodywork.
- We did see some.

But nothing major so far.
Man, was this car made out.
Of body filler or what?
Pretty much, man.
Check that out.
Wow.
That's, like,
A half an inch deep.
That's bad.
- After mark sanded off all.

We discovered that somebody.
Had filled them.
Full of body filler.
Right over all the old.
Rust that was there.
They did a horrible job.
All right, so, I'm gonna.
Order patch panels.
- And if it's gonna be a while,

- And you can.

But every time we get.
Into these cars...
It's always like this.
A freaking disaster.
We're trying to give a 1962.
Triumph a really cool,
Upgraded racing feel.
However, this thing has been.
Apart and back together.
So many times that body issues.
Just keep piling up.
Someone has modified this.
From running an actual bumper.
To running just these.
Bumper uprights.
This section here.
Was all cracked,
- So, none of this.

I'm going to have to.
Modify bumper brackets,
Cut this valance apart,
Weld new pieces in,
And remove a bunch of really.
Hokey work that's behind it.
To get the bumper brackets out,
I had to take the sway bar out.
And this goofy plate.
That somebody made.
That actually attached.
To the bumper brackets,
Which is kind of a weird place.
To mount a sway bar,
But whatever.
I'm not a mechanic.
I'm gonna cut.
These pieces here out, and then,
Just make the whole thing.
Smooth all the way across.
So, we're gonna ditch.
These big, bulky brackets.
That somebody made that,
They set this thing.
Way off the car like this.
- So, we're gonna make.

For these new bumperettes.
We got from british victoria,
- Set it in a lot.

- And we're actually gonna.

So it doesn't block.
The grille so much.
And it'll still look.
Pretty factory original,
Just slightly better.
Looks way better.
So, tiffany's our 1966 shop.
Truck we all built together.
She has nelson racing.
Mirror image twin turbos.
And a wicked holley.
Fuelinjection system.
She's putting out about 1,000 horsepower at this point.
- So, tiffany's been sitting.

- It's time to dust her off.

- And get this truck.

What's the deal?
Won't go?
- Damn.

It's ever run.
What wrong.
With this thing?
I mean, it's like... it smooths out like...
It's running worse.
And worse.
- Dude, we better.

Don't die.
Don't die on us.
Don't die.
- I hope we can pull out.

Come on, tiffany.
Don't you love us?
- Come on, girl.

Come on, girl.
She's running.
Come on, baby.
- Yeah.

She's giving us.
A little bit.
It's missing on all cylinders.
- We got stuck.

People were angry at us.
Other drivers in traffic.
Were angry at us.
You've embarrassed...
Just kidding.
It's not race ready?
It's not.
It's not

So, tiffany should make.
About 1,000 horsepower.
But when you can't make it up.
The ramp into your shop,
You might need to go back.
To the drawing board.
- So, it took a while,

- The rocker panels.

- To replace the old,

So, now, we are one step.
Closer to bodywork and paint.
Old rocker panels gone.
New rocker panels in.
It's nice and flush.
With our quarter panel.
It's nice and flush.
With our fender.
It's a much better repair than.
What the previous repair was,
Bottom line.
So, I really want to show off
Tiffany to the st.

But after that test drive,
There's no way that's happening.
- So, I got to talk with charles.

- How we can get.

- And have a cool party,

I was thinking we could throw it.
A proper st.

We got lots of cool.
Car people around here...
I like it.
- And maybe invite them over,

- Have a good time.

But I think it needs to do.
A little something,
Something special.
- Like the transmission.

We need the... number one,
Get the transmission working.
- I want a badass transmission.

I want to

Computer on the damn truck.
- And I want a wicked.

- It's got so much.

Really, really, really strong 'cause I don't want.
To break it again this year.
One massive, hellacious burnout.
And roast the tires.
A line lock.
- So, a line lock allows.

To the front wheels.
And not the rear wheels,
- So you can do.

Stupid burnout...
I know it's cheesy,
But let's make it shoot flames.
Like, flames?
Like,flames?
- Melt the paint.

But I don't think.
That's a good idea.
So, tiffany's a truck that.
Everybody seems to remember,
- But I think if.

She'll be unforgettable.
But seriously, flames.
- Yeah, that's cool.

We'll have the builttothehilt.
Transmission, the tiffany party.
I'm excited.
Lowdown throwdown.
- Let's do it.

See you.
Get back to work.
- Absolutely everybody.

- Had a hand in building.

- So, when it's time.

Everybody gets in the spirit.
- Hey.

Do you do like this, too?
This... we're in the parade.
- Start handing out the candy.

Here comes classic car.
Studio with snoop dogg.
In the twinturboed shop truck.
Yeah.
So, the first thing we need.
To do to get tiffany ready.
For a big night is to get rid.
Of that old transmission.
So, I ordered.
A brandnew turbo 400.
- With a really nice.

That'll handle.
All 1,000 horsepower.
Look at that.
Turbo 400, man,
A lot stronger than that 4l60.
And I'll get.
The old one busted.
We're gonna yank.
The driveshaft out,
Right off the bat,
And then,

- The transmission mount.

- Just take it out.

- And then,

Drill some new holes.
For putting a new tranny in 'cause we're going from.
A 4l60 to a turbo 400.
Tranny's up.
Got the bolt.
Holey shnikeys.
Look at that.
Bring it on in, scott.
Easy.
We ready?
How's it look?
Give me some eyes.
Looking good, man.
Cranking it down.
Cranking it in there.
Now, what you want?
Get this thing

Let's put the crossbar.
In there.
The crossmember.
For this transmission.
Fits inside.
A cchannel frame,
- So it's really tight.

Geez, it's a...
Puzzle.
We've kind of got to tap.
It in at an angle.
And it's a oneway fit.
We just got to find.
That way that fit is.
There it is.
- We onto a little bit.

I hope so.
There it is.
In like flynn.
Look at that.
Right on the money.
A success.
Boss noah thought it would.
Be a great idea.
To shoot flames out.
Of the side of the truck.
So, we're gonna pull the.
Exhaust off so I can get to it.
And weld the bung.
In the right way,
Tie up some of the wrap here,
- And then slam this thing.

- We got a couple things.

- So, once we get the spark plug.

We're gonna hit a button.
- We're gonna steal.

It's gonna fill up

- And we're gonna.

Maybe a 1, 2foot flame,
Something like that,
Which ought to look.
Pretty cool at night.
So, dale wants the triumph.
To have more of a racecar feel,
- So we're gonna take off.

Put two really nice.
Little windshields on there.
- That's gonna give it.

Of some of the vintage.
Speedsters back in the day.
So, we got these cool little.
Vintage racing windscreens.
To give it a little bit more.
Of a british racecar look.
I got to drill holes,
Make them fit,
- Figure out where.

- Too bad the kit.

Complimentary set.
Of vintage goggles.
Yeah, pretty cool.
So, thankfully, dale thought.
The interior was a bit drab,
Because it was.
So, we get to spruce it up.
A little bit.
The triumph is an ittybitty.
Little car, whole lot of parts.
- You figure, for a little.

That stands about 2 foot tall,
This is probably about.
A third of the car.
- We're gonna try.

That's coming down.
The center of the car.
We're gonna put the pattern.
In the seats.
Insides, we're gonna go ahead.
And go with the perf.
Na, na, na, na.
This will be the color.
You'll see on the outside.
- It's not gonna be.

Which some people like,
I'm not real fond of.
I like a little more subtle.
On a twotone.
And we've carried the twotone.
Over into the dashboard,
Which, I think, is gonna be.
A pretty cool little touch.
We're having fun with the theme.
- I think it'll look really good.

- We work long hours,

We don't get to eat very often,
So I see a great opportunity.
To make some toast.
- I'm fricking starving.

And dustin here, hopefully.
Did this right,
- So we get about 2 1/2

I'll be able to char this.
In about two seconds.
Stand back farther.
It'll burn.
Take a bite.
Do it.
- How was it?

You know, we didn't burn.
The truck to the ground,
And we made a great fire.
- Charles got to eat.

We're doing pretty good.
- So, we helped dale.

And they are perfect.
- It's time for charles.

And get it in the booth.
- So, for the triumph,

It's a custom color.
- It's got a lot.

So, with the curves.
Of this body,
The peaks will be bright,
Grayish silver.
And then, the side tone.
Will be a darker color.
This car is gonna look.
Like it's glowing in the sun.
So, we got the center lines.
All marked out on the triumph.
- Now, we're measuring.

- To where our stripes.

- I'm gonna mark all that out,

Is gonna follow behind me.
- And start laying.

So we have ultra straight.
And ultra cool.
And ultra fast stripes.
Racing stripes absolutely.
Make cars go faster,
And this guy wants a fast car,
So it has to have.
Racing stripes.
It's nice to keep my guys fed.
And, you know, keep them happy.
But this was really just to.
Entice you to get the job done,
- And then you could.

I'll take this down at this end.
This is like a carrot.
For the horse.
Got it.
We put lsd in our donuts.
Charles.
Yes, sir.
- These holes are.

Do we have the emblem.
That goes in there,
Just to make sure that.
That doesn't look stupid?
- We measured off the center of.

Yeah.
- We measured from the edge.

Great.
That does not line up.
Yeah, that sucks.
I guess I'm not getting.
The rest of my donut now.
- These holes are.

That goes in there?
That does not line up.
Yeah, that sucks.
- So, as I'm taping off.

- I notice the factory.

Are a little offcentered...
Not exactly a triumph,
More like a fail.
So, are you sure that we have.
These stripes in the center.
The stripes are centered.
This is probably.
A quarterinch off.
If we try to move the stripe.
To center it on this,
It's gonna look off...
- The whole car...

- Well, the stripe's.

The trunk lid latches here.
It's gonna throw that off.
What if we weld.
These three holes up,
Do a little repair there,
Primer, and hopefully,
Keep that repair super small.
To where we can come back in.
And just still spray.
The stripe color?
Worstcase scenario is,
We have to spray gray back down.
In that area.
I mean, it's gonna suck 'cause we're welding a car.
That's already halfway.
Through the paint process.
But I mean, I think it's.
The best way to go about it.
We never take.
The easy way out.
I wouldn't call it.
"The easy way out."
Apparently, the holes.
For this emblem.
Were drilled at about 4:30.
On a friday, in 1962, 'cause they're crooked.
It's not a big deal if you.
Don't have racing stripes.
- But as soon as you.

It is glaringly obvious.
That it is wrong.
So, weld these holes up,
Drill new holes,
Do a little bit of bodywork,
A little bit of primer.
- Hopefully, we just.

And spray the red, clear it.
The rest of the car's already.
Cleared, and then we're done.
All right,
That looks much better.
It measures out fivesixteenths.
On both sides.
Grind the welds down,
Do a little bodywork,
And prime it up.
All right, dustin.
It's time.
For the roll bar.
He's already been in one.
Accident with a giant suv.
- If there should be another.

- We also don't want to put.

That's gonna look.
Like a clothes rack.
- It's got to be even.

- It can't be, like,

So, we brought in.
A body double.
He's got one.
And that person is...
I'm gonna

- Yeah.

God.
Get in here.
So, double hump.
Around this high,
- Maybe that...

Bud, it's got

- Here?

- Just so I could take just.

- Yeah, it's perfect.

- Dale doesn't have.

Okay.
And then, the attachment points,
That's the other big question.
We actually want it to be.
A functioning roll bar.
- Yeah.

But to, like, get it to where.
It's, like, you know,
Comes up tight,
Follows him,
We're gonna need.
To attach here, probably,
Somewhere, and then down.
Through the floor over here,
And then, probably,
One coming back.
- Sounds good, man.

- The biggest problem.

- We've got pretty.

And they're actually.
All off the frame rail.
- I've fabbed up.

- We're mounting it right.

Frontperch mount here.
So, I'm gonna rosetteweld.
That and then move on to getting.
- A template built.

- The main hoop that we're doing.

- For the roll bar.

But it's also gonna add.
Structural integrity to the car.
This looks pretty good.
- Now, it's time to make.

That's interesting.
- Are you thinking.

- What?

It's gonna look goofy.
As.
With two?
I think so.
Single hoop, the double's.
Gonna kill it.
- I'm good with that, man.

- I think it'll.

Cool.
I'm putting a backbar on the.
Main hoop of the cage, also.
- It's gonna bolt,

- Straight through the floor.

- And we're actually gonna.

- The main hoop that.

Without a line lock, you have.
To brake torque a vehicle,
Which means you're trying.
To spin the crap.
- Out of the rear wheels,

With a line lock, you pump.
The brakes, hit the button,
Let off the pedal,
- And you've got.

And freespinning rear wheels.
So, once you've done it,
You can do crazy burnouts.
- And get those tires.

Now we're going to.
Lower her down.
And find a place.
To mount our switch,
And pull 12 volts to it.
Perfect.
Working on the tr3 engine,
When I took it apart,
- They had thickweld.

And it was grinding.
On the timing cover.
Best case is, we find a 55yearold british engine part.
Worst case is, these nuts grind.
Through the timing cover,
Make a big hole in it,
Leak all the oil out,
And lock his engine up.
So, we ordered in some thinwall.
Nuts, and I installed those.
- And I'm gonna see.

Well, it clears,
But it's just by a hair.
- I'm gonna have to trim.

- It's just hairs away from this.

And if it grinds that down,
We're up creek.
Let's see how she fits now.
- Yeah.

We've got clearance now,
Nothing to worry about.
- All I got to do.

And we're ready to rock her.
Back in the car.
Do I make it heavier?
You all right?
Chop, chop.

Bringing it in.
I'd have helped you,
But I'm the steering wheel.
You're doing good.
Charles' neck is about.
To freaking pop off.
Aw, the wheels

Charles and paul:

Who did that,

- Okay.

And set it in there?
Pick you up now.
- All right.

You want to

Sure.
All right.
- The motor on the triumph.

- So there's no need.

- That being said,

Oldschool supercharger.
That'll give it 30% more horsepower.
In a car this light, it'll turn.
It into a little rocket ship.
- We probably start coming down.

- I was gonna say, - "Come down a little bit."
We got to watch.
This breather tube, too.
That's probably good.
- So, then, we got the shifter.

Right.
We'll get it.
- I think, what we're gonna do is,

Past the firewall,
Maybe jack it up.
A little bit.
- Okay.

- I'm trying.

- Whoa... now...

Now, go up.
There we go.
Heck, yeah.
- We're gonna have to put.

So it doesn't go crazy on us.
When we release the strap.
- Ready?

- So, when we release the strap,

And we'll be good.
Here we go.
Perfect.
Nice landing, goose.
Well, we got the engine set in,
Still got to put the mounts on.
- But at least we didn't.

- Tear nothing up.

- Which was.

Yet.
- Don't say "Yet,"

We don't want

But so, we're gonna.
Put the mounts on it,
Start bolting her on.
Later, supercharge.
Installation.
- Well, we're gonna make.

Let's do it.
This thing's gonna look.
So badass on there.
What the?
Man, it don't fit.
- Had to take the header.

Nothing's ever easy, doug.
Welcome to "Love tuneup."
"Dear love tuneup,"
I'm falling really hard.
For my new boyfriend.
He's super sweet, athletic.
And has an awesome '69442.
- The only problem.

I feel he's moving.
Too fast for me.
How do I slow him down?
"Sincerely, janice."
- Well, janice,

By putting some.
Really big brakes up front,
Like sixpiston calipers, 13- or 14inch rotors.
Do the same in the rear,
But a big fourpiston caliper.
- Then, you need to upgrade.

That way, you have control.
Under these abrupt stops.
- And then, add some.

So you feel safer.
At these higher speeds.
And if all this.
Doesn't work for you,
Maybe you ought to just ride.
With your eyes closed.
- Thanks.

So badass on there.
What the?
Man, it don't fit.
We got to do.
Some modifying.
Had to take the header.
Back off, too.
Nothing's ever easy, doug.
You know it.
We're stuck somewhere.
Are we hitting.
The body down here?
Well, we got interference.
With our aftermarket header.
That was on this triumph,
So we either got to.
Modify the header tube.
Or come up with some kind.
Of supercharger spacer.
To get it out

Probably, the most legit.
Fix is to relocate.
- That header tube.

- I'm gonna take the.

And we'll modify that tube.
And make this thing fit.
The modifications complete.
I'm gonna put it on there.
And bolt.
The supercharger over it.
And hope for the best.
- Well, we got.

It almost looks like.
It was made that way.
It could have been.
A whole lot worse.
- So, we got.

- And hundreds.

All to show off our badass.
Shop truck, tiffany.
We couldn't be more excited.
- We've had that truck.

- We've never showed it off.

- I can't wait to do.

- What's up, everybody?

My name is noah alexander,
With classic car studio.
So, about a year ago,
We built a crazy shop truck.
Her name is tiffany.
It was a project where,
- We didn't have a customer.

- So we kind of just did.

Every guy had a little bit.
Of input into the project,
- And you know,

Are fricking awesome.
- We've had it all.

- Won some cool awards,

We have never had a proper.
St. Louis homecoming.
Thank you.
Come on out, girl.
Come on out.
Yeah.
Move, people,
This thing gets out of whack.
All right, everybody.
Anyway, this is tiffany, 1966 chevy shop truck,
Blazeframe on the ground.
We got twin nelson.
Racing turbos.
It makes about 1,000 horsepower,
Ton of custom metal.
- It freaking.

You guys ready.
For a burnout?
There you go.
Get a fire extinguisher.
Yeah!
Thank you.
Good job, buddy.
- Holy,

- Even better than.

What a crazyass crowd of people.
That turned out tonight.
I was not expecting that.
It's an honor.
Love to our.
St. Louis car community.
- Dale's picking up.

But we keep hitting speed bump.
After speed bump.
After speed bump.
That are getting in the way.
Of completing this damn car.
- I've been trying to put.

Like, over two hours.
Why are both sides.
Missing one of these?
'Cause apparently,
It has no cage nuts.
Are you kidding me?
- I don't know where.

If we can find a trunk latch,
That'd be great.
All the gauges got to be undone.
To get this in there.
Trying to take.
The steering column out...
Drop it down, anyway,
So we can get the dashboard.
To clip under.
I got a project for you.
- I think we want to mount.

Are you - kidding?
Why didn't we do this.
About five days ago?
- So, here it is.

And we've got one last detail.
To do on this car.
- It's gonna, you know,

Of fabrication for scott,
But we're basically.
Going to hang the fog lights.
- Off of a.

It's gonna be a.
Dualpurposetype bracket.
And I think, in the end, it's.
Gonna turn out really nice.
- There's a big gap.

Sorry, guys.
This car is.
Fighting us all the way.
- It just...

- It's probably 3:00 or 4:00

We're all tired.
- You know what?

- It would stick a lot.

I'm probably being way pickier.
Than what the factory ever was.
This stuff never fit.
Worth a crap, anyways.
Little car,
Big pain in the ass.
So, dale asked me to meet him.
At the airport with his triumph.
But little does he know,
As soon as he lands,
I've got the airport.
Closed down all day,
- And we can drive it.

Well, there he is.
- What's going on?

- How are you?

- How you doing?

- What's your first impression?

- My god.

You know, I saw it.
From the air.
- I couldn't hardly believe that,

It is your car.
- So, with the paint,

Three coats of base,
Five coats of clear.
You know, that silver,
I think, with that red,
And the way that red pops,
I think, is fabulous.
Absolutely.

You know, rebuilt.
From the ground up.
- What do you think.

The wheels

- We were able to keep.

- But it's a.

And it's got a real racy look,
Which we're a huge fan of.
Do you like it.
Without the windshield?
Windshield, it's very nostalgic.
- It feels like.

- And it just looks.

- We looked at.

- A lot of different.

- And dustin helped design.

Really nice, elegant.
We got lucas fog lights.
On the front.
So, on the interior,
All new carpeting,
We've got sound deadening.
It's a much.
Betterconstructed car, now.
- I didn't think.

We haven't even gotten to the.
Performance stuff yet, so,
Want to look

I would love

- There was only one.

It's a completely rebuilt.
Judson supercharger.
Yeah, so we added 30% more horsepower.
30%?
- Yeah.

The thing sounds great,
Pulls hard,
Makes great power.
Ready to rock

- Ready for a spin?

Who's driving,

You can drive.
That's great,

Yeah.
Yeah.
- It feels good.

Wow.
Well, noah...
- -what do you think?

It runs its ass off.
It drives beautiful.
Cool.

Take it back to the shop,
- And you can pick it up.

- Just let us know.

Okay.

That's gonna happen.
I'm gonna take this,
And I think you'll find.
Another way home.
What are you

But enjoy your car.
Yeah?
- Thank you.

- All right.

I'm gonna get.
On the plane.
- Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo,

This is nicer.
Than the triumph.
