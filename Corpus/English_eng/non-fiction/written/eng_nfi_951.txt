Previously on The Last Man On Earth...
- I need to know what this pill is.

Uh, Gail, it's a match.
(both laughing, clamoring)
Looks like we have company, and that company is a Yoda.
TANDY:

(screaming)
(a la Yoda):

I can't believe a kid's alive.
Poor thing, what he's been through.
Alone all this time.
No family, no friends.
Has he said anything at all?
Not yet.
TANDY:

(chuckles) You guys'll find a way to bond with him like I have.
Isn't that right, you little turkey?
What a connection.
So, look, I know what you're all thinking.
You know, Tandy's the finder, so, naturally, Tandy should be the keeper.
No one's thinking that.
Yeah, there's no keeper in this situation.
This is a child.
Or a Benji Buttons.
Okay, if you still think he's a Benjamin Button, you shouldn't be anywhere near him.
Fine, he's a kid.
Look, I put in a lot of hours out there in those woods opening up my heart, and making him feel the security that only a father can provide.
Now, am I his literal father?
Probably not.
But am I spiritually his father?

So to quote the late Sir Paul McCartney, and the even later Michael Jackson,
"That boy is mine.
That doggone boy is mine."
He doesn't belong to anybody, you friggin' nimwood.
Maybe I can help.

I learned that the most important thing you can do
- is project a feeling of calm.

You know, just make him feel comfortable, safe.
Hey, there, little guy.
- Hi.

We're all your friends.
Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?
(all talking at once)
Hey, there, my little dude.
You want to take your mask off?
Okay, nobody takes that mask off.
He wears that thing forever, you hear?
Are you hungry?
You want some pizza?
(both gasp)
Well, there's that beautiful face, huh?
Hey, can you tell us your name?
Huh?
Oh, he's shy.
Okay, let me start.
My name is Tandy.
Okay, so, uh, can you tell us your little name?

It appears we're dealing with a deaf.
Or, like, a Nell.
CAROL:

I'm gonna say some common names, and you just let me know if I guess it.
Daphne.
Smeegle?
LaFontaine.
Carol, those aren't common names.
Maybe not where you grew up, but we had two LaFontaines on our block.
Oh, they were always picking on poor Smeegle.
- LaFontaines are notorious bullies.

His name's labeled right here on the front of his backpack.
He's Jansport.
No, Tandy, that's the name of the backpack company.
But it's got a nice ring to it, huh?
All in favor of naming the kid "Jansport"?
You can't name a kid a backpack.
And I would never suggest that we do that, okay?
But we can be inspired by it.

Jan, Janice...
Oh, I like Janice.
Janice it is.
No, you're not naming him Janice.
Guys, look, he's obviously got a name, and he'll tell us when he's ready.
But in the meantime, we have to call him something.
I mean, kids need names.
It gives them confidence, self-esteem.
Half the kids in jail never had names.
That's why they give them numbers.
Ooh, how about Jansport?
Oh, we already did that one.
Uh, Jasport!

Uh, Japort, Japah...

Jasper... what do you think?
Fine.
Is that okay?
Can we call you Jasper?
He loves it.
Hi, Jasper.
Hey, you want to play a game?
You do, huh?

(laughing)
Hey, bud. (chuckles)
It's good to get away from those chumps, huh?
Just the boys, am I right?

Psych!
Too slow, yeah.
Hey, I got a little something for you.
Hang tight.
(engine humming)
Jasper?
Jasper?
Huh.
(turning siren on and off)
(laughs)
Well, there you are, you little, turkey, huh?

Guess we're gonna have to work on the meaning of "hang tight," 'cause you immediately took off.
No worries, bud.
Here, come on, check this out!
Look at this.
Isn't this cool?
This is called a margarita pool, Jasper.
Now, margaritas are an adult beverage that contain alcohol.
Now, what is alcohol?
Alcohol is what grown-ups drink when they want to get crunk; you know, loose.
Yeah, come over and check it out.
Oh, no, no, no, no!

This one's for me, okay?
But don't you worry, 'cause I got you a hot tub sundae!
Come on, Jasper, last one in is a rotten egg.
(laughter continues)
Oh, very slippery.
Come on!
(laughs)
(singsongy):

JK, bud.

Look at this, look at this.

(laughs)
Some peanuts.
And some cherries, too, huh?
(laughs)
This is fun and delicious, huh?
Oh, that whipped cream has gone bad.
It's gone bad.

Where you going, bud?
You gonna get a big run-up?
Gonna cannonball me?

Jasper.

(accordion playing)
♪ Crack that whip. ♪
- Hey, Todd.

What are you up to?
Ah, just going to give Melissa her medication.
Oh.

Well, apparently it takes a few weeks to see results.
But the side effects are coming in hot, so that's a good sign.
You know, increased heart rate, lots of sweats, tarry stools...
Don't need all the deets, Todd.
Copy that.
Hey, thanks again for your help.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Hey, bud.
I know this all must be so new and scary, but I'd like to introduce you to a friend, who might just make you feel a little more comfortable.
This is Gary.
When I was all alone, this little guy was everything to me.
A mother, a father, a brother, a sister.
A distant uncle who tells it like it is.
And I'll be honest, a few days away from being a lover.
But most of all, he was my best friend.
Now I'd like him to be your best friend.
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Erica, stop!

Gary!

I saw what you did last summer.
- What?

Todd.
Me and Todd what?
The way he touched your shoulder?
I thought the fireworks would burn my face off.
Felt like the 4th of May over there.
You mean 4th of July?
No, the 4th of May...

My family were avid walkers.

Anyways, I thought you two were broken up.
We are broken up.
Hell, friends can touch shoulders, for God sakes, Carol.
Well, looks like this friend was itching for some benefits.
Carol, why are you all up in my butt about this?
It's a tale as old as time.
Girl gets stuck in an elevator, nearly dies.
Comes out scared, emotional, raw.
And then her scenester ex-boyfriend swoops in with his shoulder touches and his sweet talk.
"Hey, babe, how you feeling?

I'll make it go away."
And then you boink all night.
Boink, boink!

Yeah, it's hot, and it's kinky, and it's making the voices in your head stop.
But the next day, you wake up and he's gone.
And, PS... (whispers): you're pregnant.
Yeah, Carol, I don't think any of those things are gonna happen, especially that last part.
Got it.
Oh, God, I don't know what you think you got, but you might want to spend some of the brain time worrying about Tandy and that kid.
But they're doing great.
TANDY:

How dare you!
Are they?
Jasper!
We're not done here.
He trusted you, Jasper!
Oh, don't worry, you're gonna be okay, okay?
- How's it going, Tandy?

He just needs a little air transfusion.
Look, I hate to kick you while you're down here, but a lot of people are a little concerned that you might not have the aptitude to be a care giver.
Carol, I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
I mean, I'm bending over backwards for this kid, pulling out all the stops.
But he's just acting like a real LaFontaine.
Well, if he's misbehaving, then maybe you got to do something about it.
Have you seen Mr. Holland's Opus?
- No.

But that same year, there was another movie that came out called Dangerous Minds.
Oh, good, okay.
It's about a woman named Michelle Pfeiffer, who marches into an inner-city classroom, and for the first time in the history of the world, she wins kids over with stern disciplinarianism.
She just lets her hair down and puts on a tight-fitted leather jacket.
She flips her chair around and doesn't take any guff.
Do you see at what I'm getting?
Look, I know you want to be a boy's man, but I think right now, you need to be a little bit more of a Michelle.
Oh, I can be a Michelle.
Well, well, well, what do we got here, huh?
So you think you're pretty cool, huh?
Mr. Tough Stuff?
Don't listen to nobody, no how, huh?
Well I got news for you, compadre.
There are rules around here.
Yeah, things that we do called "rules."
Everyone's got to follow... w-w-w-wait!
Now, w-wait, Jasper!
A cigarette?
Give me that.
Where'd this come from?
J-Jasper!
Where these cigarettes coming from?
(laughs)
I found it.
The river always leads to the lake.
Look, I can play your game all day long.
So what's your next move, huh?
'Cause Tandy ain't going nowhere.
Consider us attached to the hip like a pair of conjoined twinsies.
You know what those are?
They're twins attached by the skin.
Wait, wait, wait, where you going?
(stammers) Jasper!
Jasper!

Uh...

I'll give them back, yeah.
If I give these back to you... uh, when I give these back to you, will-will you do something for me?
(chuckles)
Like a puppet on a string.
(laughs)
Well, look who's out and about.
Hey, Melissa.
Oh!
Have you been Jazzercising?
TODD:

Sweating's one of the side effects.
And tarry stools.
(sighs) Look, I'd love to get into that later, but let me just cut to the Chase Manhattan.
I've noticed you've been spending a lot of time with Mom lately;
touching shoulders and whatnot.
And I just need to know, what are your intentions, Mr. Flores?
Uh, Mr. Flores?
Pedro Flores, inventor of the yo-yo?
I'm sorry, Carol, I'm not following.
Do you intend to wrap my mom around your little finger and toy with her, hmm?
Do a little down-up, down-up, maybe walk the dog, go around the world.
And once you've had your fun, stick her in a drawer with your Pogs and Tamagotchis.
Carol, Gail and I have been through a lot.
I-I'd never do anything to hurt her.
Good.
Don't ever try anything funny, Todd, 'cause I'll be watching you.
Watching you like a hog.
(snorts)
Evening, everyone.
Oh, hey, Melissa, hey.
(chuckles) You been Jazzercising?
(chuckles) Keep it up, looking trim.
Anyway, a little birdie told me there was a bit of concern about my parenting skills.
Uh, in light of that,
I just wanted you all to know that Jasper is dead.
- (gasps) No!

Uh... sorry, metorically, not literally.
Idiot.
Could've been a little more clear about that.
- Yeah.

I, you know, I slaughtered the old Jasper,
I burned his corpse and dumped his ashes in the toilet.
But like the phoenix, Jasper is reborn.
And now, it gives me the greatest of pleasures to introduce you to... the new Jasper!
Jasper, what do we do when we enter a room?
(chuckles) What a gentleman.
Have a seat, please.
Jasper, I was just about to ask you what we immediately do upon sitting at the dinner table, but looks like you beat me to the punch.
That's right, we put our napkins in our laps.
Good job, Jasper.
Good job.
(imitates explosion)
(laughs)
That's right, explosives, even in fist form, are only for adults.
I taught him about the dangers of explosives.
- Oh, wow.

GAIL:

Thank you, Gail.

- Aw.

Oh.
Jasper, you're doing so great.
Tandy, what are you passing Jasper?
Uh... (laughs)
A compliment for a job well done.
Oh, no, I think I saw you give him something under the table.
Holy hell, he's giving him cigarettes.
- CAROL:

- TODD:

Jasper, where'd you get all those cigarettes?
Oh, come on, Tandy, we all know where he got them!
Well, then somebody please tell me
- 'cause I'm in the dark here.

What?

- Hello!

Jasper, did you put cigarettes in my shorts pocket?
That's it, Tandy, I really don't think you should have anything to do with this kid.
But we share a special bond.
Yeah, they're called cigarettes.
But those have nothing to do with it.
Look, he loves me like a point person.
Well, then I think it's time he picks a new point person.
Okay, Jasper.
Now when I say go, you're gonna walk to the person you want as your point person, okay?
And people who he doesn't go to?
No crying, please.
The system's not rigged.
Okay, you ready?
(whispers):

Tandy, no cigarettes.
Nice try, Gail, but you can't just spring a last-minute rule on me here, right?

No!

- Tandy, no.

Okay, fine, fine.
Okay, Jasper, you ready?
And go!
Jasper!

Aw, thank you, Jasper.
Okay, round one goes to Erica.
Uh, best of three.

What?
Okay, so where do we stand?
Uh, Erica has 21,
Melissa got a quick three when Erica went to the bathroom.
Uh, okay, so the tide turns now.
Here we go, best of 49.
No, we're done here.
CAROL:

(softly):

I see.

And, uh, bud, you sure this is, uh, what you want?
Then so be it, all right?

You're going to need these, Erica.
- Oh!

You know, I should've named you Brute, 'cause you stabbed me in the back.
(voice breaking):

Oh.
Carol, what in high heaven did you tell Todd?
I just told him that if he ever messed with you,
- I'd give him the Pilbasian horns.

There are two men left in this earth.
Just two.
You're married to one of them.
So my options are pretty limited.
It's Todd or bust.
So if, in the future, I decide that I want to get back up on that Todd horse, then I am gonna get back up on that Todd horse and I am gonna freakin' ride!
Do you got that?
Okay, I got it.
- Good.

You don't know how lucky you are to be married to that dumb son of a bitch, so count your blessings, 'cause I'm about to go get down and dirty with a CPR dummy.
That's my day.
(slurping)
Hey, Tandy.
You doing okay?
Oh, yeah, I couldn't be happier.
Do you want to talk about it?
Carol, what if our baby doesn't like me?
Oh, don't be silly.
No, I mean, I've been trying so hard with Jasper, and he's just not having it.
I'm just worried the same thing's gonna happen with our kid.
Tandy, our child's gonna love you.
And Jasper's gonna love you, too.
You're a grower, not a shower.
- You think so?

- Gail?

- Melissa?

- Erica?

- Todd?

- Jasper spoke?

Carol, that's everyone.
Did you say Gail?
Yes, I did.
Oh, you said that first.
Now I remember.
- Gail said something nice about me?

So you just hold that chin up and let the world see your beautiful neck.
'Cause our baby needs that.
And so does Jasper.
(chuckles)
Yeah.
Knock-knock.
Hey, Tandy.
I just wanted to come by and say sorry for being such a sore loser.
Figured it was time to extend the old olive branch, as they say.
So, here you go.
Okay.
I couldn't find an actual olive branch, so this is just a regular tree branch with an assortment of canned olives taped to it.
It sure is.
Well, thank you, I guess.
It's really sweet of you.
I know.
Um, anyway, uh, how's-how's he doing?
Oh, he's good.
We had a lot of fun today.
Really tired him out.
Good.
Well...
Do you want to say good night?
Oh, I mean, I-I don't know.
- I mean, you know, he's sleeping.

- Yeah, but I don't want to bug him, he's...

- Really?

Okay.
(chuckles)
Uh, okay.
Maybe just for tonight.
Good night, little guy.
