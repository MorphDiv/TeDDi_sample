Warlocks, vampires...
All the legends are true.
We protect the human world from the demon world.
You're a Shadowhunter, just like the rest of us.
I'm getting married to Lydia.
Maybe you should do what's in your heart.
I am your father, Clary...

I need to talk to you.

Got a lot of stuff to work on here.
Like controlling my murderous tendencies.
The Mortal Cup is the most important object in the Shadow World.
Valentine has the Cup.
He'll create an army of Shadowhunters.
He'll kill thousands just creating the army.
Strike where your opponent is vulnerable.
He's here.
- Where's your brother?

Simon!
Fight me, and watch your friends die.
- They make you weak.

Valentine is wrong.
- You're not like him.

You don't know that.
Jace...
Join me...

Together, we can rid the world of the demons who plague it.
You are the new breed of Shadowhunters!
Jace...
Clary?
Clary.
- How did you get here?

Come on, let's go.

- I can't.

Look, we got to get you out of here.
No, I'm not leaving without you.
My dear Clarissa.
- You are tenacious, aren't you?

I killed him.
- Jace, come on.

- We have to go, now!

Miss me, son?
Jace!
What is this place?
Looks like a Downworld prison.
More like a zoo.
Where's the Portal?
Your skills may be unparalleled...
But your loyalty is sorely lacking.
String him up.
Any word from the Clave?
Not yet, and we've been trying for the past four hours.
- Something's up.

Who's shocked?

I'm worried.

We'll find him, Alexander.
When we arrested Hodge, he said Valentine was on a ship.
They must still be over water.
Pull up the waterways around New York.
The ship couldn't have gone too far.
- Anything?

There's got to be something!
I don't see him.
All right, listen up!
I want 24/7 monitoring of the Hudson and East Rivers.
If you see anything unusual, you come to me first.
I've got this, Alec.
Then why haven't you found Jace yet?
Don't forget who you're talking to.
I am still the head of this institute.
And my brother is still missing!
- Why don't you just take a break?

Isabelle's right, and it's not a request.
You're dismissed.
Fine!
Hey...
Everybody, just back off!
Mom.
- My sweet girl!

I'm so sorry.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
All I ever wanted to do was to protect you.
I know, but...
I'm not a kid anymore.

Yes, I do.
By telling me lies?
Clary...
It's my life.

I was scared.
Because you married a psychopath...
My father.
So, you know.
- Mom, how could you?

Your father, he wasn't always like this.
- I deserved to know who I really am.

And I promise from now on, no more lies.
Okay.
I have something for you.
Where did you get this?
Under the floorboards.
When I was a little kid and I couldn't sleep, I...
Used to watch you take it out and cry over it in your bedroom.
I used to think it was about my father, but now...
I know it's about my brother.
Jonathan.
His name is Jace.
He's alive.
That's impossible.
I'm sorry for how I reacted before.

I get it.
I'm a lot to get used to.
I know what you're going through, Alexander.
No, I...
I don't think you do.
Jace is a part of me.
Through a rune, we are both physically and emotionally connected.
If he dies, a part of me dies, too.
And I know he's out there.
And he's in trouble, and there's not a damn thing I can do about it.
Tell me what I can do.
Help me track Jace.

I just need your magic for the pain.
- I can't help you with this.

The last time you used a rune to track Jace, it almost killed you.
Why can't you just do this one thing?
After everything I've done for you.
You don't understand, I saw them burn.
Sorry, I just wanted to make sure everything was...
- Okay.

You all right?
Is it true?
Is Jonathan alive?
I couldn't believe it either at first.
Hey, guys.
- Simon.

Good to see you on your feet again.

Considering the coma situation.
What're you doing here?
Um...

So, um, a lot...

- Yeah.

You're a vampire.
We have to get to the ops center, right now.
We are at war.
Valentine now has the Mortal Cup, with which he is, no doubt, raising a new army, and one of our own has joined him.
Looks like the queen's taking back her kingdom.
As a result, the Clave has declared a state of emergency at the Institute.
Their first priority is to replace the current leadership, who they have deemed wholly ineffectual.
It is an honor to introduce the newly appointed head of the New York Institute,
Clave representative, Victor Aldertree.
- Did you know about this?

But maybe this is why Dad went back to Idris.
Maryse went behind my back.
My fellow Shadowhunters.
It's an honor to be here with you all.
We have to find Jace Wayland.
He's a Shadowhunter, and we don't leave our people behind.
The answer to his location may very well lie in this room.
So, I wanna speak with everyone who went on a mission where Jace disappeared.
One last thing.
Effective immediately, the Institute is on lockdown.
But it's only temporary.

Wait, if we're on lockdown, who's out there looking for Jace?
We'll think of something.

Jace is tough.
Valentine will never break him.
Enough!
I killed you twice today.
You want to go for another round, huh?
You're a born fighter.
I like it.
Get dressed.
We have a lot to talk about.
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Clary.
Take a seat.
Sorry about the camera.
Like I told your friends when they came in, this is official business, so...
I have to be official.
Now...
Let's talk about Jace.
Okay.
You had the impression he was saving your lives by leaving with Valentine?
It's more than an impression.

If he had tried anything, the rest of us would have been killed.
Was he within striking distance of Valentine?
I told you, it...

Could he have taken the man out?
It was an impossible situation, okay?
Jace tried to warn us.
He told us Valentine was on the way.
So...

- How do you suppose he knew that?

He told us to get out of there.
Next thing I knew, I had a seraph blade to my throat.
Oh.
Got it.
Look, Jace saved our lives.

That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Mmm.

Do you remember your fifth birthday?

Your absolute favorite.
Michael Wayland used to make me spaghetti.
Just try some.
You really think I want to have a meal with you?
Didn't I teach you not to play with knives?
Look, I know that head of yours is full of questions.
So, go ahead.

Why did you fake your death and pretend to be Michael Wayland?
To protect you from my enemies.
As Michael Wayland, I knew you'd be safe.
- Safe?

You made me an orphan.
I spent my entire life mourning a father
I thought died in front of my eyes.
Well, it made you stronger, didn't it?
No, the Lightwoods made me strong.
They took me in, they trained me.
If anyone's my parents, they are.
I had no choice, Jonathan.

I sent you to a place where I knew you would be cared for.
Father of the year.
Look, we had ten years together, and sure...
I may have been hard on you, but...
It's because I loved you, son.
No.
All you've ever done is lie to me.
You told me I never had a mother.
What did you want me to say?
That I saved you and that your mother deserted you?
- She left you to die in Idris.

Why would she do that?
Because you're different.
You're special.
Look, I know that you have always felt more powerful than everyone else around you.
That's because you are.
You experimented on me?
I made you stronger, faster...
More lethal than any other Shadowhunter.
Why?
To create the perfect weapon, the ideal marriage of good and evil.
A Shadowhunter with pure demon blood.
Hey!

Are you goin' home?
Where else would I be going?
My interview's over, and I'm exhausted.
Besides, at my house, there's steak and vodka.
I'd rather be there.
Wait, you're just...

You really don't get it, do you?
You didn't risk anything for me, you did it for you.
What?
Are you seriously doing this right now?

You know damn well I want to find Jace just as much as you do, but that's no excuse to treat me like...
Well, then, what do you want from me?
At the moment...
Nothing.
Who sounded the alarm?
- What's going on?

Jace.
Aldertree said he wanted to rescue Jace.
Actually, Clary, I said I wanted to find him.
And you gave me the clue I needed to do just that.
- What did you tell him?

Is this everyone?
Fantastic.
First up, all Downworlders are forbidden from entering the Institute without my prior approval.
For those still present, good day.

I'm not leaving Jocelyn.
Besides, my badge gives access to resources that you don't have.
I can help you find Jace.
That's generous of you, but I'm going to have to insist.
- Call me when you can.

You, too...

Simon, right?
It's almost dawn.
I don't have anywhere to go.
Hey, you're a smart guy.
I'm sure you'll figure something out.
Simon, come on.
I'll be okay.
Now...

I've reviewed your statements, along with the reports of your unsanctioned missions.
And I can come to no other conclusion that Jace Wayland is a traitor to the Clave.
Jace is not a traitor.
Point of fact.

Jace had multiple chances to kill Valentine, but chose to let him leave.
Now, Valentine, Jace, and the Cup are missing.
Do the math.
There is no way we're going to help you hunt Jace.
And I'd never ask you to.
You and your friends are prohibited from any further involvement for the hunt for Jace Wayland.
What?
The rest of you, back to work.
I'm lifting the lockdown on the Institute, except for Clary and Jocelyn.
Given your relationship to Valentine and Jace,
I want to keep a close eye on you.
This is ridiculous!
- Clary...

We cannot just sit around.
Okay, they're going to kill Jace.

I know you think you understand this world, but you don't.
Dismissed!
You can't do this.
See, that's the thing about being the boss.
I can and I did.
Then revoke the dead-or-alive order.
Jace is one of us.
Challenging the authority of the head of the Institute is grounds for severe punishment, including de-runing.
Thanks for letting me crash here.
- You're a lifesaver.

I'll be at the station when you wake up tonight.
So, um, this...

He's got issues, right?
Aldertree's not the problem, the Clave is.
They're scared, so they're clamping down.
So, do you think it's true...
What they're saying about Jace?
That he's working with Valentine?
- I don't think so.

He could come for Clary next.
He's totally hung up on her.
So, are you worried about Jace?
Or maybe telling Clary how you feel?
Be bold, Simon.
I'm bold...
Adjacent.
I gotta take this. "Adjacent."
Garroway.
Bold.
I can totally be bold.
What's up, guys?
We know Luke said you could crash here...
But not here.
You don't want to touch me.
Encanto.
What the hell are you doing?
Encanto.
Um...

It's supposed to make you do whatever I tell you to.
You're the worst vampire ever.
Okay.
Welcome to your new home.
Left!

Impressive, aren't they?
But they still don't have the inherent gifts that you have.
You took to a seraph blade the way a baby takes to a bottle.
What kind of a father experiments on his son with pure demon blood?
A father with perspective.
We both want the same thing.
To save this world from demons.
The Clave fights demons.
The Clave has grown soft...
Protecting Downworlders with the Accords.
All Downworlders, one day, will give in to their violent tendencies.
It's unavoidable.
Even a single drop of demon blood running in your veins, makes you a threat to humanity.
I...

They control their urges.
You're thinking of Lucian Graymark, warlocks like Magnus Bane, and even...
Clarissa's little vampire friend Simon?
No matter how good they try to be,
Downworlders cannot control their demonic blood forever.
If that blood is so evil, why did you put it in me?
To fight fire with fire.
I wouldn't jump if I were you.
Why?

This warlock is infamous for crimes against mundanes.
There's something else I want you to see.
- Come on, let's do this.

You seriously want to train right now?
We have to find Jace before Victor gets him killed.
Training's important.
So, pay attention to what I'm about to show you.
You need to watch your footwork.
Aldertree threatened to de-rune me if I tried to find Jace.
So, how do we get to him?
Let's go again.
Have you studied The Art of War?
That was not on the reading list at art school.
You should learn it.

Like what?
"Move swift as the Wind and closely-formed as the Wood.
"Attack like Fire."
But my favorite...
"To know your enemy, you must become your enemy."
I'm a quick study.
Alec.
Alec, slow down.
Where are you going?
Magnus'.
I couldn't just sit in there and not do anything.
He'll help me find my brother.
Jace is not your brother.

He's closer than blood.

Alec, we looked like fools taking in Valentine's son, caring for him like our own.
It was the right thing to do.
It was a mistake.
It put our family in danger.
You need to forget Jace.
He made his choice.
Do you even hear what you're saying?
If you kill him, you kill a part of me.
When you have a cancer, you cut it out before it destroys you.
Son...
Life is full of hard choices.
Don't kid yourself.
You're not making a hard choice.
You're saving your own ass.
And unlike you, I don't push someone away just 'cause they're a hard choice.
Luke!
I need your help.
What, we on a first name basis now?

Oh, God, sorry.
In order to know my enemy, I had to become my enemy.
I had to get out of the Institute.
- Aldertree forbid me to leave.

I took one of Jace's gloves to try and track him, but it's not working.
Can you see if the police know anything?
Yeah, I'll contact the Coast Guard.

By the way, Simon's in the supply room.
- Simon's here?

- I'll let you know what I find.

Yeah.

I don't know how to do this.
I don't even know where to start.
You think there'd be some sort of handbook for the Shadow World, like...
Shadowhunting for Dummies.
Clary!
- Thank God I found you.

Luke called you.
And what are you even doing here?
You're not supposed to leave either.
I went to Aldertree and asked him to let me bring you back.
You told him?

I know.

I want to help you.
I'm here for you.
We need to find Jace, right?
Let's find him together.
I tried tracking him with the glove, but...
Let me show you something.
Give me your phone and stele.
Here are some basics of Shadowhunting.
Mom!
Mom!

First rule of Shadowhunting, don't give anyone your phone or stele.
Thanks.
Magnus.
I'm not good at apologies...
But I'm...
I'm sorry.
Continue.
I'm...
Really sorry.
For?
Look, can you just cut that out for a second?
You were right.
When I called off my wedding, that was for me.
But this is all just...
It's very new.
This may surprise you, but you're new for me, too.
Look, with Jace missing, it's just like...
The ground has shifted, and I can't keep my balance.

I didn't mean to take it out on you.
I'm sorry.
You're forgiven.
Also...
You're great at apologies.
Thanks.
I've been working on it.
Here's the thing...
We're always going to face challenges.
So, when things get crazy, don't push me away.
Simon, your phone gets no cell service down here.
That's okay.

Simon, just stop.

It's no use.
We're stuck down here.
I'm enjoying our together time.
Reminds me of 10th grade when we snuck into my mom's liquor cabinet.
Oh, God.
Oh, it was my first wicked hangover.
This is worse.
Mmm...
- It...

- It's ridiculous.

How crazy our lives have gotten in the last few weeks.
Yeah.
You kill demons now.
Yeah.
I drink blood now.
And it used to be that...
The biggest problem we had was that...
I was secretly and totally...
- Here.

We don't have much time.
Hey.
You did it.
Yay for me.
All right, Alec, ready to track your parabatai?
I got them.
What just happened?
Did it start?
I don't need to.
I sense him.

We're stopping for pizza?
Reggie served the best pie in all of Brooklyn.
Note the past tense.
When Reggie's wife, Maria, turned into a vampire, she slaughtered Reggie and created a den inside.
What does this have to do with me?
You really think love will keep you from hurting your family and friends?
No matter how hard you fight it, demon blood will make you kill.
It starts in a small way.
Urges.
See, that's why you want Clary, and that is why you always will.
Everyone run.
Get out.

Hey, out!
Hey!
Which one of you is Maria?
Who's asking?
Jace is back.

Izzy and I will bring him back alive.
One step ahead of you.
We got a hit on the map.

You're not listening.

We won't let you do this.
Hold them here until we get back.
I'm sorry.

Pretty strong, even for a Shadowhunter.
You're feeding on innocent mundanes.
A girl's gotta eat.
- Your mom's close.

I'm a vampire.

You're done.

- You can't kill me.

I surrender to the authority of the Clave.
Aw, look at you.
You got your stick all ready to go and now you can't use it.
No, you broke the Accords.
You killed innocent mundanes.

But unlike them,
I'm no longer a threat.
I know my rights.
- Your rights?

I might have broken the Accords, but I know you won't.
You don't know anything about me.
I know you're weak.
Mmm.
I can smell it.
And you'll do whatever the Clave tells you to do.
- Now, get off of me.

Are you going to let her mock you after what she did?
This thing in front of you...
She was once Reggie the pizza guy's sweet and loving wife.
You leave my husband out of this!
Whoa.

You mean the man you devoured?
That's what you mean.
Ah, that's my boy.
No!
Run, Jonathan.

Mom, stop!
What have you done?
