In New York, they have soirees.
In L.A., they have galas.
But at East Indiana State, you haven't lived till you've been to the annual
Axl, Hutch, and Kenny 'Bago Bash... beverages and food not included.
All right!
We did it, man.
Pita chips and no hummus.
The flier specified
"All chips to be accompanied by their respective dips."
Well, let's send it through the skylight and see what the people have to say.
Come on in.
She's been good to us.
Yes, she has.
I mean, I can't take it with me, 'cause I'm gonna be in grad school.
Well, I can't take it.
I got a business degree from East Indiana State.
Carrying a briefcase down hallways, asking people about their weekends.
Okay.
What if we give it to a needy freshman, let the legend continue?
Or... we could sell it to a needy freshman and let the legend continue.
Oh, you are a business man.
Mm-hmm.
Whoo-hoo!
No, it is not.
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
You can't be the beret kid.
I don't care how many bullying seminars they have.
A beret is just a big, fat target on your back.
Yeah, well, be prepared to fish your tam out of the toilet.
Anyway, you've heard of the musical "Hamilton"?
Well, the school is voting on what the spring play should be this year, and I was thinking, with the recent popularity of "Hamilton,"
that I would write and submit my own.
Because if we're celebrating unsung heroes,
I believe there's someone we're all forgetting.
Sergeant Charles Stuart MacKenzie!
It's got everything...
World War I, bagpipes, Scottish rap.
I can't leave work today to pick him up
Dr. Goodwin's getting me to take me to some seminar.
Well, hopefully it'll happen on the bus and the driver will just carry him to the stoop.
They all laughed at Lin-Manuel Miranda.
Thank you for saying so.
Now you have a great day and be fierce.
I will.
See, that's supportive parenting right there.
Hey!
Who is ready for an eight-hour lecture on polymers?
I'll give you hint...
It's me!
Uh, so, Mike, uh, how's things at the quarry?
A little rocky?
Kidding.
Uh, anyhoo, do you guys have seminars, too?
The job's pretty much the job.
And feel free to go into detail.
Drive safe.
You were looking on the wrong side.
I told you, the pain is on his left side.
Frankie, this is cuckoo.
I need my chair and my light and my spit sucker.
His tooth is killing him, but I haven't been able to get him to a dentist in years, so I am sorry, but if you want to diagnose him, you got to do it here.
Now get in there.
I sure like coffee.
Uh, how do you take your coffee?
Do you take it bla-a-ck or with cre-e-e-am?
Black.
Cool.
Ooh!
Hey, can I show you my new phone?
It's got all sorts of neat stuff on here.
It can tell you how many steps you've stepped.
It can tell you the temperature in Charlotte.
It's even got a camera on it.
Smile!
Frankie!
Really?
Well, I'm sorry, but you've been in pain for months, and you won't go see anybody.
And I haven't died yet.
You don't have to feel embarrassed, you know?
A lot of people are hinky about the dentist.
Well, thank you for that, but I'm not hinky about anything.
I just don't like the idea of someone poking around where they got no business being.
I just want you to take care of yourself, all right, and now is the time to do it when I have free dental care.
I can't get Axl to do anything.
There's a lot of road to travel between me and that destination, but I am relieved.
Thank you.
And don't worry, Mike.
I promise, I'll be gentle.
Look at these little woman hands.
When I hold hands with a girl, sometimes I can't tell who's who.
Lexie, we're gonna need more milk.
"Milk" has been added to your shopping list.
You got used to the 36 jets in the tub.
You can do this.
I'll tell you another thing I can get used to... a possible boyfriend!
Is it the super-hot guy that drives the Jeep?
No, it's the attainable guy who drives a golf cart.
Who?
You know, Tyler, the safety-cart guy who takes injured people around during the day and drunk people home at night?
He kind of looks like Woody from "Toy Story."
Oh!
Well, Woody's definitely the hottest one in "Toy Story."
I know, right?
Anyway, he seems super sweet and nice, but I'm not sure if he's interested in me.
Every time it seems like something's maybe about to happen, we get to where we're going, and I have to get out.
Next time, tell him you have to go to the Pharmacy Building.
That's, like, practically off campus.
I hope he likes me.
I need a man!
"Man" has been added to your shopping list.
Oh, she's good.
Mm-hmm.
I'm surprised you didn't want to come in on a day Frankie was working.
She is such a hoot.
Sometimes she pretends to nod off while working and slumps right over onto her patient.
So, here's how this is gonna work.
You're gonna tell Frankie you checked out my tooth, it's fine, and that's gonna be the end of it.
What would I tell Frankie?
Well, if it makes you feel better, we can go grab a beer and that way when she says, "How'd it go?"
you can say you spent an hour with me and I was happy, and that would all be true.
Okay, I guess I'm in.
All right.
We're like Thelma and Louise.
No, we're not.
As you can see, we are sitting in the dining room featuring a low-maintenance Formica table.
And over here, we have the European-style kitchen featuring a fridge and bonus second-story access.
Now, the fridge holds up to three cans of your favorite beverage and an apple.
The possibilities of 'Bago living are endless.
Now if you'll kindly follow us to the bathroom.
And I urge all of you to stay together.
I don't want to lose anyone.
It's not for everyone.
So, I did what you said.
When Frankie asked how it went, I said, "Fine."
Great.
I said you had mesial distal occlusal with a slight pulp horn exposure.
You got that?
Mesial distal occlusal with a slight pulp horn exposure.
Or you could have just said you took care of it, and we're done.
I wish you would have told me that before, 'cause I said yoneed to come in for a follow-up appointment.
Why'd you tell her that?
Because you had a mesial distal occlusal
Listen, if we're gonna get away with this, we got to get our story straight.
This thing lives or dies in the details.
Now, Frankie's coming home with the appointment card.
Just act casual.
This conversation never happened.
So...
I hear someone had a mesial distal occlusal with a slight pulp horn exposure.
I told you it wasn't nothing.
Here's your card for the follow-up.
Oh, yeah.
I'll figure it out.
Can I run a few things by you, Dad?
You know a lot about musicals.
No, I don't.
Ane, twa, three.
Wait a minute.
As I hear "goat," I'm not loving it.
I'm gonna work on that.
Hmm.
Okay.
I changed your appointment for you.
It's with Dr. Lambert now.
So you could see your game.
No.
I-I don't want to see some other doctor.
I-I only want Dr. Goodwin.
Aww, that's sweet.
But Dr. Lambert is really good.
He's even staying late and missing his kid's volleyball game so he can do this.
I mean, a guy who doesn't put his own kids first?
Brick, knock it off.
I want Dr. Goodwin.
I-I-I will only accept Dr. Goodwin.
All right.
I'll change it back for you, but you're gonna miss some of the Pacers game.
I-I don't care.
It's worth it if I can see the world's best doctor.
You have no idea.
Hey, I got your call, and I rushed right over.
Oh, thanks for picking me up from the party.
I walked by some kids who were smoking, and I held my breath for as long as I could, but then I had to take a breath.
And I don't know what they were smoking, but it could have been marijuana, because one of them had a knit hat on.
Yeah.
Yeah, so... the whole party thing's not really my scene.
Yeah, I'd much rather have, like, a nice dinner, cozy evening in, maybe watch some Netflix.
I'm basically 40.
Mm-hmm.
Anyway, I'll have you home in just a minute.
Oh, actually, I have to go to the Pharmacy Building to pick up a notebook.
It is beautiful, isn't it?
"A Tree Falls for Forest."
What's that?
Oh, it's so bad, it's good.
It's about this freakishly tall girl who falls for a guy named Forest.
Yeah, you got to see it.
I love movies that are good but you make fun of and are about tall people.
Well, you know, if you wanted to see it, uh...
Dude, you got to get me to the grad dorm fast, 'cause that's where I live.
Jeremy?
Well, well, well.
Look who's here.
The girl who fracked my heart!
We kind of dated a little bit.
W-We dated a little bit?
I haven't had the energy to chain my myself to anything in months.
I-I-I just breathed something in that I shouldn't have, okay?
It's imitation... just like your love.
Stop!
I have to puke, and I want to do it on the Econ Building
Uh... we broke up a couple months ago.
You can just drop me off at my apartment.
Well, in that case, it looks like we're here.
Oh.
Okay, well...
So consider my cart at your disposal.
I'll pick you up tomorrow at 8:00?
You could even pick me up at 7:00.
Or 8:00. 8:00's fine.
All I know is, nobody can resist the lure of a car-dealership blow-up wiggly guy.
Wiggly-guy high five!
I don't even need to ask any question,
I'll take it.
Yeah.
We made $54.
I can sell anything.
I can't believe there aren't three dudes like us out there, looking to live in a rocking 'Bago.
Hey, is this Winnebago still for sale?
Uh... well, there is someone who's very interested coming by to look at it, but since you guys are here now, first come, first serve.
What do you think?
Oh.
Did she have a little too much?
Uh, t-this is my girlfriend, Julia.
I like your necklace.
It looks really good on your neck.
Oh, thanks.
Tyler gave it to me for Christmas.
I always thought he was sweet and nice.
Well, anyway, I will hop on...
Well... this is...
This is gonna be so much fun.
Uh, I brought some Milk Dudes in my purse if anyone wants for later.
Aah!
Mike!
Listen, I realized when we left the office to go get a beer,
So if Frankie sees the tape, she'll know that we left early, and I wouldn't have had time to do a mesial distal occlusal with slight pulp horn exposure.
Look, you're way overthinking this.
Why would Frankie ever look at the security tape?
I told Frankie you and I went outside because there were miscreants in the parking lot.
We wanted to see what they were up to.
They ran away, but they'd broken into my car and stole my coat.
That's why I'm not wearing one now.
By the way, I donated it to charity so I wouldn't mess up and wear it to work.
Okay, so, what's our next move?
My next move is going in the house.
Oh, hey, you're home earlier than I expected.
We had so much fun.
Me and him... and his girlfriend!
Why wouldn't Tyler tell you he had a girlfriend?
I don't know, but her name is Julia, and the sad thing is, she's not awful.
We shared popcorn, and she mixed in MM'S, which is a really good idea, and I can't believe I haven't thought of it before, and, oh, my God, I'm so stupid!
I read all his signals wrong.
Tyler only thought of me as a friend.
No, it's my fault, really.
I talked too much about my heavy periods.
I dropped myself right into the friend zone.
Yeah, that'd do it.
Aurora, put sugar in my mouth.
I'm sorry.
I cannot process your request.
Aurora can't, but I can.
Well, they voted on the musical, and I lost.
Which means either Cindy or Troy did not vote for me.
They went with "Carousel."
For a Heck, that's a win.
I'm telling you, it's "Orson, The Heartland's Hidden Gem"
all over again.
I was so close... to have victory snatched from my grasp like that.
I guess America's just not ready for historical Scottish rap.
Boy, I read that wrong.
Ah, you're just too cutting edge for people around here.
I mean, we just got a P.F. Chang's.
Anyway, there's always next year.
Oh, I'm not giving up on my musical.
I'll be workshopping it every weekend here at the house if need be.
I-It's a whole homeowners' association thing.
That's why we can't paint the house.
Hmm.
Hey, why didn't you tell me about all that excitement the other night?
Oh, uh... well, there's nothing much to tell.
There were some miscreants.
I'm going to bed.
It's only 6:30.
I'm babbling.
Good night.
Oh, wait.
We could get the footage for that night and find out who it is.
Um... if you look at the tape, you won't see us coming back in the building, 'cause we came in through a side door.
Didn't the alarm go off?
Uh, no.
Uh, Dr. Goodwin had a special key.
So, he does have the code.
I can't believe Dr. Goodwin keeps telling me he doesn't have the code.
I have to park on the side and walk all the way around to the front, and he knows I hate walking.
I'm gonna talk to him about that.
Uh, you know, don't.
He's having a bad week.
Why do you say that?
Uh...
If anyone asks... your aunt died.
Lilah or Pauline?
Well... guess this is it.
This 'Bago gave us a lot of good times.
And several fairly serious recurring leg rashes.
Hey, you remember that time Kenny was sitting right there, and he laughed?
Hell yeah.
You don't forget Kenny's first laugh.
Well, if you need me,
I'm staying with my girlfriend's cousin Ronald.
His nickname is "Bear."
He thinks guys bond by wrestling.
Hey, it's not like this is goodbye.
We're still gonna be seeing a lot of each other.
I mean, weren't we gonna have to do this in three months anyway?
That's three more months we could have had together.
Frankie, listen, I forgot to tell you...
Dr. Goodwin isn't gonna leave for his aunt's funeral until Tuesday 'cause he's got to stop at the vet first.
Aah!
I got it back.
Yeah, I see.
Now we're gonna have to rehearse what we're gonna say to the police?
Nah, it's cool.
How'd you get it back?
I just told those guys that they're now legally responsible for all the 40 parking tickets we left unpaid.
No, they're not.
They don't know that, but as a law student, I do.
You're not a law student.
They don't know that, either.
Now we're gonna take this thing down to the quad and throw the most epic rager in the history of East Indy!
Wiggly-guy high five.
Whoa!
The walking helps my cramps, but I've already shared too much.
Sue, stop.
My girlfriend broke up with me.
Julia thinks I might like another girl, and she's not wrong.
Oh, my God.
You are sick!
You have a girlfriend, you like another girl, and, I'm sorry, but it seems like you were being a little bit flirty with me.
So if you were looking for a woman friend to talk about your relationship problems,
I am not going down that road again.
I do like another girl.
Really?
Yeah, Julia pointed out that at the movies,
I spent the whole time looking at someone else.
Just to be clear, it's me, right?
Okay, but if you could just put it into words so I could...
Sue... it's you.
Bagpipe beatbox!
How many more hours till I can take another pain pill?
You just took one.
Damn.
