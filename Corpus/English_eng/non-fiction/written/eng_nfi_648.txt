Oh, yes, you are a lifesaver!
Don't try and tell me that that's just a car-wash office.
What the hell is going on?
It's a legal firm, Chatterjee amp;

And, um, Johnny?

Never charged, but he's paying off his debt.
I'm your bit on the side.

Really well done in there.

Seems I surprised you.
Yes, yes.
No!
No, I...

Lewis, I think it's best if we leave our personal history outside of these walls.
Yeah, I agree.

(MEN CONVERSE ANGRILY)
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)
You're doing it wrong!

Hey, Mal.

I'm sorry.

I'm calling the police, you little thug!
I'm sorry, Miss.

Police.
1x05
(TYRES SCREECH)
So, what's this going to cost?

It could have been worse.
They could have charged you with recklessly causing injury.
Assault's not so bad.
Well, tell him the good news.

Despite your previous time in juvenile detention,
I think I can convince the police to deal with your case under the restorative justice process.
It's all about rehabilitation, not punishment.
Reconciling the offenders and their victims.
Um, I don't get it.
You tell the boss you're sorry and we won't have to buy you soap on a rope.
The whole point is to avoid prison time.
You know, the worst outcome is that you'll have to do some community service.
It's not a difficult decision, brother.
Yeah, alright.

Good.

Alright.

Hello!

No pro bono.

Spike doesn't qualify for legal aid.

With what?

The car will have to wait.
Good morning, Jackie.
For you.

(SARCASTICALLY) That'll be good for the diet.
Hey!
It doesn't matter how much that woman butters me up, it is inappropriate for a barrister to have a solicitor hanging off their coat tails.
And she lied.
To be fair, I never asked Josephine whether she had a relationship with the car wash, but...
I've got more important things on my mind.
Well, hey, they can't stay!
Now, you own the building and you have to do something about it.
I'll look into it.

Absolutely.
Oof!

Do you think she told Whitley about downstairs?
In excruciating detail.
But don't worry - I've got him to flick you a brief.
And he agreed to that?
Well, it's family law.

Because...?

Ah, of course.

I told him you're desperate to do it.
Just want you to know you weren't my first choice, but Claire's appearing for the other side.
Don't feel you need to butter me up, Eric.

My soon-to-be ex-wife is not satisfied with taking me to the cleaners financially.

Now she wants Abigail.

I thought you'd already sorted this out!
Josephine's completely on board.

Melinda is not getting Abigail.
Oh.

Are you sure you don't want to consider a shared care arrangement?
Absolutely not!

Um, how old is Abigail?
11.

And does she live with you full-time?
We're inseparable.

Yeah, she's here now.

Then you can ask me anything else you need to know.
Ah, good idea.
Abigail?
Abigail?

Come!

There you are!

What have you been up to?
You've been going through Daddy's briefs again. (CHUCKLES)
Isn't she beautiful?

You can see why I wanted to fight Melinda's application.
Say hello to Josephine!

She's adorable.

JACKIE:

You be good!
(CHUCKLES)
How long were you going to let me believe Abigail was a child?
I tried.

Whitley's only got two boys.

Hmm.

Not an 'abuse the legal system for petty reasons' person.
This shouldn't be going to court.
Federal Circuit Court.

(CHUCKLES) No, you don't.
Is there a problem?
Halliday was my research tutor in final year.
That's right.

Oh, you know very well he practically stalked me.
You used to call him Clag, he was so stuck on me.
Well, it's your choice.
You know the lease is coming up downstairs and Jackie wields a lot of influence.
And it wouldn't hurt to show some cleavage.
In my experience, Halliday's more of a leg man.
What?
Perceptions.
Eric, it is your building.
(HUSHED CONVERSATION)
Stop.

Um, Josephine!
Just one more thing I wanted to discuss.
Your old firm downstairs.
Oh, it's an entirely new business.

That's true, but, look, I'm in a difficult position here.
It's more about perceptions and keeping all my tenants happy.
I'm going to have to think carefully about my responsibilities as landlord.
What do you want, Eric?

No touting for business downstairs and I don't want to see you in that car park, unless you're getting in and out of that monstrosity you call a car.
Agreed.

Good.
Sorry, it's just until the lease rolls over again.
I can live with subterfuge.
So, is this Johnny's friend?

Yeah.

The mediator will probably be that woman with the big earrings.
And the hairstyle.
Short on one side, long on the other.

So, you know what to do.

Use the word 'journey' a lot, and 'healing'.
Change yourself and you change the world.
We will be the change we want to see.
You've got this.
Maybe we should leave these here.
Johnny could put a couple of hooks in.
Maybe a shelf.
Thanks!

"Slice finely and then simmer until soft."
You haven't told me how your day was.
Time passed.

Indulge me.
Dad's going to get me a dog.
We can't have a dog here.
Yeah, well, it's not going to be here.
It's going to be at the house.
What about when Dad goes away?

Yeah.

I'm not a cat person.

Well... ..that is perfect, then.
That's an upside-down pineapple cake, isn't it?
Haven't seen one of these in a long time.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Love the coconut innovation.

Do a bit of innovating myself, actually.
Mm-hm.

A reliable favourite.
Well, you know, you don't want to underestimate its potential.
I do a tea-infused version.
Earl Grey, obviously.
Then I add cinnamon, cardamom, cloves.
Hmm?
So, um, whose silly idea was the touchy-feely option?
Um, restorative justice was my idea, Sergeant.
I thought the police were supportive.
Um, we are.

Um, I mean, I've got nothing against it in principle.
It's just the rigmarole that goes into these mediation sessions.
It's enough to put you to sleep.
But, of course, having you in there, that'll spice things up a bit.
I didn't mean spice.
Not...

I didn't mean...
I like Indian spice.
I like...

It's just...

..when I'm cooking, obviously...
Thank you for dropping in the medical report, Sergeant.
Now... (CLEARS THROAT) ..I have some work to get back to.
Sure.

Um, good.

Good.
(LIFT DINGS)
Hello.

Hmm.

She'll find out when she gets it.

I'm sure I've seen you downstairs.
I thought perhaps this might be from your legal firm, Chatterjees?
My firm?
Do I look old enough to run a legal firm?
Oh.

I believe Chatterjees will be moving on soon.
Just pass it on to Miss Newton, please.
(LIFT DINGS)
Pants?

Just a very good memory.
What are you doing here?

Claire's probably going to try to push into the emotional stuff - what the dog means to her client, blah-blah-blah.
She can't.

Exactly.

Oh, don't worry.

I can take it from here.

(DOOR OPENS)
(GAVEL BANGS) WOMAN:

MAN:

"How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?"
How many's that, Your Honour?
How many can you afford?
(LAUGHS EXAGGERATEDLY)
Miss Newton, it's lovely to see you again.
It has been far too long.
Appearing for the respondent, Your Honour.
Right.

Abigail was a gift from my husband 11 years ago.
And in that 11 years, who was responsible for the upkeep of the dog?
I was, until my husband and I separated.
Vet check-ups, grooming, feeding, walking.
I took her everywhere with me, did everything for her.
And did you feel that the dog was your responsibility?
Definitely.
The relevance of this, Miss Zhang?
Oh, donative intent, Your Honour.
To clarify that the dog was a gift and, under law, there was a clear transference of property.
Ah.
A gift she never wanted.
Is Abigail currently living with you?
Yes.

I'd like to point out that I've paid for everything since she was a puppy.
The vet bills, the grooming, the food - that was me.
MELINDA:

You were never home!
How can you look after her if you're not there?
Order, please.

Of course, Your Honour.
And please remind her that the dog's welfare is irrelevant in this court.
This is purely a matter of property settlement.
So, you're unable to provide any kind of paper trail that proves you purchased the dog?
No.
Right.
And do you agree that your wife is the person who walked Abigail, fed her and took her to the groomers on a regular basis?
Yes, but I've been doing all that since we separated.
So, for one year of the 11 years of the dog's life, you've been responsible for her needs.
I don't see what the hell that's got to do with it.
She never wanted the dog and now she's mine.
Alright, alright, that's it.

I'm not going to let you waste valuable court time on squabbling over what is already bordering on a spurious application.
I'm recommending informal mediation and hopefully I'll see you at 10am tomorrow with a result so I can make orders.
Until then.
For a man wearing a purple shirt, he's quite impressive, isn't he?
Oh, it's not purple.

I like colour.

And I definitely think he's improved with age.
(COUGHS)
Hello.

My name is Sasha and I'm here to help you on what I hope will be a quest towards justice and healing.
Thank you, Sasha.
My client is keen to mend bridges and move on.
Oh, Spike's a good kid.

I know he did the wrong thing, that's true, but I'm not one to hold grudges.
So, if we could get this sorted out,
I'd be more than happy to have him come back to work.
WOMAN:

Malcolm gets these kids straight from the youth training centres, drags them out of the gutter, gives them a chance in life and this is how they treat him.
He's an ungrateful brat!

If we could all just take a deep breath.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
(INHALES, EXHALES)
The way forward is through respectful dialogue, not through insults.
Gregor, do you have something to offer Malcolm?
Perhaps you'd like to tell Mr Dougall how you feel about what happened.
(WHISPERS) Hey, go on.
Nah.
We talked about this, remember?
An apology is an important part of the healing process.
Go on.
Yeah, well, I changed my mind.
This is some bullshit.

I'm not sorry at all!
That boy's got mental problems.
Oh, why couldn't you keep your big mouth shut?
MALCOLM:

I think it'd be best if we all just took a moment.
Don't speak to my wife like that!

No, no!

(GROANS SOFTLY)
(SOBS)
(SNIFFLES)
Um...
(SNIFFLES)
I'd just like you all to know that I'm extremely disappointed in you, so I'm now going to bring this session to a close.
You have one more session allocated to you and I think you should all think carefully about how you would like to complete this journey to justice.
I'll speak with my client.

There's no danger in falling asleep in this one.
I lost it in there.

Well, at least someone is.
If we can't get mediation to work, the case will have to go to court.
I know.

I know.

A moment of your time?
If you can't do something about what is happening down in the basement...
I am doing something, but it's complicated!
Oh, look, you said you were going to give them the boot, and Josephine is still sneaking around behind your back.
You've got no...
My client's agreed to the arrangement.
Whenever you're ready.
Good.

Right, we all know why we're here and, frankly, I think there's only one option - we chop the dog in half. (CHUCKLES)
Ah, here she is!

Come on, Abigail!

Aw, my good little girl.
MELINDA:

Come here.
Thank you.
My darling!

Aw, aren't you gorgeous?
Oh, she is filthy!
When was the last time you even washed her?
And what have you been feeding her?

I wash her every day.

This is supposed to be a mediation, not an... inquisition!
(WHISPERS) Dissection's looking good.
Perhaps if we'd like to get back to the issue...
I know what this is about.

Alright, then.

Worth 50,000 at least.

I'll confer with my client.

I don't want your stupid painting.
This isn't about money!

That's all you're interested in.

I think that's enough.

We'll see you back in court.

What was that argument you used to get me back to the bar?
Something about being at the coalface of law?
Well, it's definitely getting dirty.
And definitely about much more than the dog.
Hello!

Oh, you are adorable.
He said he'd take you back.
You chuck away this apprenticeship, you know what's going to happen.
You'll go back to doing what you were doing before.
Maybe it's what I was meant to do.
Be a shit-kicking car thief?

You know I don't do that anymore.

Ah.

How long's that going to last?
Once a shit-kicker, you're always a shit-kicker.
Can't escape it.
Yes, you can.
Doesn't matter what I do,
I'm always going to be a loser to everyone else.
They're never going to let me forget it.
Who's not letting you forget?
The boss knows what I'm good for.

Doesn't matter, mate.
Hey... what does he think you're good for?
Got you to do a job, didn't he?
He's running a chop shop.

When I told him I wouldn't do it anymore, he... ..he threatened me.
Said he'll tell the cops it was my idea to steal the car.
Then why don't you go to the cops, come clean?
Are you serious?
What, then have a car-theft charge on top of an assault?
Hey, you know what, Johnny?

People like us, as far as everyone else thinks - always going to be second-rate.
Get used to it.
(WOLF WHISTLE)
Don't you have somewhere better to be?
Not really.
You make silk, fees get higher, lunches get longer.
Oh, pretty soon, you won't be working at all.
You never heard of golf?
I don't possess the lack of imagination for sports.
(LAUGHS)
MISS ZHANG:

I don't...

Hmm, a month ago.
Um, two, I think.

Um, five months, according to your dog groomer's records.
He said the dog had been groomed twice in the last year and each time she was delivered not by yourself but by a woman.
Is that correct?
Um, yes, sometimes, I got a friend to take her.
I see.
And is that why you didn't take up the groomer's recommendation to consult a vet over Abigail's skin condition?
No, I was aware of that.
Objection, Your Honour.

Counsel, I thought we had clarified that the dog's welfare is irrelevant.
Oh, most animal's welfare is completely irrelevant to me,
Your Honour, but I'm not talking about care.
I'm talking about maintenance of property.
Well, continue.
Tell me, do you get your car serviced regularly?
Yes.
So, you maintain your car and your house - lawnmowing, plumbing, any repairs that need doing?
I have the details.
Then you know I do.
So, with everything else you own, you're careful to maintain their upkeep, and yet Abigail's been allowed to slide into a state of disrepair.
Abigail's not like a house or a car.
Oh, under the law, I believe she is.
Um, no further questions.
If I could re-examine, Your Honour.
Oh, I'm fascinated to see how you can, Miss Newton.
We'll reconvene after lunch.
That's an E, not an F. I know that.
Do you mind if I do it?

I can do it.

(VAN BEEPS)
Hey!
What's he doing?

No, mate.

Hey!

Oi!

Oh, come on!
Helena?

(ON PHONE) It's blocked the front of the office and the driver's gone upstairs.
Yesterday, the power went off.

Jackie Russo?
Ah, yes!

Um, are you sure that was the right place to park?
It's blocking the car wash.
Oh, that's fine.
Nothing important happens downstairs.
(GROANS)
Johnny is threatening to hot-wire the van.
Oh, perfect.

Excellent.

Tell Johnny to go for it.
It's alright!

We saw nothing.
(SIGHS)
Is there anything you'd like to discuss with me, Jackie?
Anything bothering you?
Oh, I'm sure I haven't got a clue what you're talking about.
Alright.
Can you tell us how you use Abigail on a daily basis?
What's your typical routine?
Um, yes, I...

Then shower, a quick walk, breakfast together.
Then I go to work at eight, home again by six.
We play together for about, I don't know, half an hour or so.
She's got this little... ..toy on a string.
She loves that thing. (CHUCKLES)
And then?
Then it's dinnertime - lean meat and vegetables.
I do a little bit more work and then it's bedtime.
Counsel, I'm...

Your Honour, my learned friend is trying to blind us with semantics.
This talk of maintenance is just a dressed-up version of caring.
I'm talking about use, and as we've just heard, my client uses Abigail every day.
If I remember my early law lectures correctly, possession is a state of exercising control over an object.
Animus possidendi, I believe.
Mm-hm.

The only time a mechanic came anywhere near the first car that I owned was the day that I bought it.
I never washed it.
I used the inside as a mobile storage system.
A Volkswagen Beetle, perhaps?
And I used it every day.
Just because I didn't check the oil every day, or get it waxed and polished, those are not grounds for denial of ownership.
Fair point, counsel.
However, as much as I'm enjoying this little dance around the finer points of family law, from here on,
I think we should all focus on bringing this to a resolution.
So, you and Halliday - it was a two-way stalk?
Oh, it was a long time ago, but I am impressed he remembered my car.
What if it compromises the case?
Oh, we all have our personal histories, and the legal world is tiny.
And I don't ask about you and Claire.

Met through work, went out for a year, amicable split.
A year?

That's a long time for you.
Was she in a coma for some of it?

Is Mr Whitley in his chambers?
I believe so.
Oh, before you go... ..you've been nominated as fire warden.
Drill instructions are just here.
I'm honoured.
Does it suit me?

It's about as subtle as you are.
I'll let you know if I have any questions.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
Just when I thought work was done for the day.
Hats off inside.
Who's the other woman?

The way Melinda reacted to the idea of another woman dropping Abigail at the groomer's.
She wants to get back at you for something.
I'm assuming an affair.
You still available?

Come on, Eric.

If we can get to the heart of why she's fighting you, we could have a chance of winning.
She's got a point.
If you were representing you, you'd want all the ammunition in your arsenal.
Unorthodox is only a stone's throw away from unprofessional.
No full names.

Alice from the clerk's office.
Alice?

Lasted a couple of months, that's all.

Um, Nova.

Oh, the prosecutor from the Baines case.

Um, no.
Just put X. Um, Patricia.
Oh, Georgina and Liz.

Um, should I get another whiteboard?

Oh!

At the beach house.
She's got quite a few reasons to be upset, then.
But the affairs started AFTER we got Abigail.
I still think they're linked.
She's hurt, and she knows how much Abigail means to you, and she's looking to hurt you back.
Agreed.
I'll ask them to come to the table tomorrow.
I think you should apologise.
What?

You've got nothing to lose, Eric.
I can help you with the wording.
No need.

Grovel, accept all blame, and prepare for punishment.
I think that was a yes.
Well, definitely a rescue dog, but if we get a puppy, then we can go to puppy training together.
Um, can I speak to your father, please?
In a minute.
I'll come to your house, walk it every day, and feed it.
That's what you said about the mice.
Sorry, Dad, got to go.

Rescue dogs have issues.
Who doesn't?
You're not getting a dog.
I will put an electric fence across the front door if I have to.
This is really between me and Dad.
You don't really get a say.
ROBERT:

Skye.

Sergeant... (CLEARS THROAT) ..how may I help you?
Hello.
Um, look, I, um...
Well, I don't know if I should actually be telling you this.
Um, your client, Gregor...
Spike.

Well, he didn't turn up to the station yesterday, and he wasn't there again this morning, so he's, um, he's breaching bail.
Now, I can give him a little bit of leeway, but if he doesn't appear at mediation, then I'm going to have to put out a warrant for his arrest.
I appreciate that.

Alright, I'll see you.
Bye!

I don't understand.
Mediation is Spike's best chance.

(GROANS)
I should have said before.

Well, I didn't want to get him in more trouble, did I?
Jonathan!
Spike's boss, he's running a car rebirthing operation.
Got Spike to hot-wire an SUV.
I mean, Spike doesn't feel like he should have to apologise.
He shouldn't.
And by pointing the finger at his boss, he's admitting to another crime.
Yeah, well, that's what Spike's worried about.
At least we can try and help him on the assault, but only if he turns up tomorrow.
Give me his number.

Thanks.
How much do I owe you so far?
Well, there's the next mediation and the paperwork.
I can cover it.
That boss shouldn't get away with it, you know.
Yeah, well, even if Spike talks, who's going to believe him?
It's the boss's word against his.
I might have an idea.
(SIGHS)
What if the boss comes out and we're just sitting here?
It's a bit obvious, don't you think?

Well, maybe if we pretended we were pashing or something?
If you want to keep your lips, you better back away right now.
Yeah, fair call, fair call.
Oh, it's an SUV.
Looks stolen to me.
It's the boss!
Tilt your head.
Got the plates.
Good.
(WHISPERS) Hey!

I just need something I can...
I can give you a hoist.
Yeah, alright.
Whoa!
(GASPS)
You better not be enjoying this.

I believe Eric has something important to tell you.
Yes.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Melinda... ..when we married, I made a promise to you - a promise that I didn't honour, and I was unfaithful more than once.
I know the breakdown of our marriage was my fault.
Instead of meeting things head-on, I ran away, and that caused...
..problems.
And I am truly sorry because... ..because you were the love of my life.
Thank you.
Thank you for acknowledging the damage your affairs caused to our marriage.
But I still want Abigail.
MISS ZHANG:

I don't mind how long this drags out.
See you tomorrow.
I apologised!
What more does Melinda want?
(GROANS)
Halliday wants irrefutable proof that Abigail belongs to Eric.
I've got a hunch she knew about the affairs all along.
There is something else driving this.
Would you give a woman a present before you cheated on her?
I don't know.

Yeah.
Hey, I might chop and change a bit, but I never double up.
OK.

Maybe I could talk him into giving the dog back?
(DOOR OPENS) I want you to win this, whatever it takes, whatever you have to do.
Oh, excuse me.
I was looking for Eric.

He went out.

You might be able to help me.
Something happened around the time Mr Whitley gave his wife a dog.
I need to know what it was.
My job relies on discretion.
And you're very good at your job.
I also know that Mr Whitley's happiness is...
It's important to you.
Discretion is a vital part of my job as well.
ERIC: (ON VIDEO) Here we go.

(PUPPY WHINES) (LAUGHS) She's going to love this!
Whitley had it in a box of things in his office.
Melinda dropped them off after they separated months ago, but he never went through it.
Jackie did, though.
We can't use it.
Well, it proves ownership.
Eric won't want you to show this.
"Whatever it takes."
Those were his instructions.

Hey, Spike.

Mediation's starting in five minutes.

Should I ask you how you got this footage?
It's better if you don't.

(PHONE RINGS)
Hi, Helena.
No, I'm listening.
Has Detective Malouf seen the footage?
Where's Spike?
Well, if you're going to present it, you have to have his instructions.
This could be his only chance.

Go with your gut.
Then do what you think is best for your client.
It's your only option.

This is a video filmed by the respondent on April 17, 11 years ago.
April 17?
(ON VIDEO) Here we go.

Ready?

(PUPPY WHINES) Come on, smile.

Smile!
Honey?

Surprise!
(LAUGHS) She's for you!
Oh, no, I don't want it.

Come on.

(PUPPY YAPS) (SOBS) I can't!
No!
No. (SOBS)
April 17, 11 years ago was the day Mr and Mrs Whitley learned that their only daughter died in utero.
This case has never been about who owned what.
It was about the acknowledgement of a terrible loss.
However, as you insisted, Your Honour, rightly or wrongly, the law is only concerned with the notion of property, and as we saw in the video, although Mr Whitley had donative intent, the gift was not accepted by the applicant.
At law, Abigail remains Mr Whitley's property.
I agree.
Unless there's anything further?
I dismiss the application of Mrs Whitley and declare that the terrier known as Abigail is the property of Mr Whitley.
Thank you, Your Honour.
Thank you, counsel.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Why didn't you tell me?
Well... this is just unbelievable.
HELENA:

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but we've been through everything already.
All we need to finish proceedings is your client's apology.
There are a few things that I need to clarify.
Is he going to apologise or not?
Well, no, he's not.

He's not going to apologise.

Provocation?
But there's nothing in the record suggesting that.
You're making a mockery of this process.
Far from it.
This process is supposed to be about justice, and my client has not been treated justly so far.
He was provoked when he found himself in a situation that was intolerable.
Was he assaulted by his employer?
Physically, no, but his character was assaulted.
He refused to allow him to rise up above his past to be the kind of person he wanted to be.
Spike was defending his sense of himself, which was under attack by Mr Dougall, a man who has things to hide.
You're even dumber than I thought.
ROBERT:

I must inform you that you don't need to say or do anything, but should you choose to say or do anything, it may be used as evidence.
Do you understand what's being said to you?
Will there be charges against Spike for the car theft?
Well, I'll talk to the prosecutor.
He'll be a witness against the boss, so...
Oh, I'm sure we can come to an arrangement.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
Hey.

Thanks, brother.

Stay out of trouble, eh?
So, what do you think, Melinda?
Eric's proposal is shared care - a week with him, a week with you.
Well, any offer will need to be discussed...
I'd like that.
I think Abigail would like it too.
Thank you, Eric.
Oh, bugger it.
I still miss her.
Every day.
Wish I could take credit for that one.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Thank you.
I know about you and Eric.
I've always known.
I don't blame you.
In fact, I like you.
And I think Eric likes you quite a bit.
You're good for him.
Best of luck.
Oh.

Now rinse that under warm water.

You're welcome.
Can't have a Knox barrister looking slovenly.
Ah!
You'll let me know how much it is?

What's this?

HELENA:

We can take it straight out of your wages.
You don't have to touch your savings.
Was this your idea?

Oh, that cop came here earlier, left something for you.
♪ I really care a lot
♪ Although I look like I do not
♪ Since I was shot
♪ There's been nobody but you
♪ I know I look blase
♪ Party Andy's what the papers say... ♪
Eric?
♪ At dinner I'm the one who pays
♪ For ain't nobody like you
♪ Nobody but you... ♪
I hear there's a fire needs putting out.
♪ Ain't nobody like you. ♪
I got this for Eric to celebrate, but his door was locked.
Must have taken an early mark.

Oh, and this just came for you.
Looks fancy.
Halliday's invited me to the Family Law Ball.
What are you going to wear?
Have you still got that gold dress with the side split?
Um, might clash with the purple.
Aubergine.
(CHUCKLES)
What shall we drink to?
The triumph of love over logic?
(PHONE RINGS)
That's my cue.
Now, um, I know you're not a dog lover, but...
I love dogs!
You forget, when Lydia was little, I really wanted a dog, but you wouldn't agree.
Yeah, you're right.

I wasn't there for you before, or for her, and I'm just trying to find ways to make up for that.
Sometimes, I get overwhelmed by the detail, and I... forget about the important things.
I think... ..that it would be good for Lydia to have a dog.
I'm glad to hear that.

Josephine Newton!

It's Martha Paine here!
Where are you?

If you're involved in covering up a crime, say kidnapping...
I haven't kidnapped anyone.
So, you're abandoning me and Finchley Financial Management?
It breaks my heart.
I love watching you fire up.

Says the man who never fired up about anything.
OK.
I'm only just OK.
Oh, you know, you have your moments.
We're fighting for civil liberties, freedom of speech.
If we were any more virtuous, we'd be annoying.
