[X's "Los Angeles" playing]
[doorbell buzzing] [lock buzzes]
Sophia, unplug that steamer.
Back away from the motherfucking keyboard, sister.
Dax is on his way, and we need to rock 'n' roll.

Tell me there's a wasp here and buh-bye.
No.

Rock a swimsuit.
I don't have a swimsuit.

I don't have time for your judgments.
I'll go without.
Yeah, girl.

[car horn honking]
There's Dax.

Ooh, I know.
Earthquake kit underwear.
Goodnight Moon?

God, why couldn't I have packed a thong?
Okay.

This is who you're gonna be in the New California?
Walking around wearing granny panties, holding a Discman, listening to what?
- Hootie?

- That's the last time we'll say that.

I can make these work.
You better, 'cause you haven't seen Shane in months, and I saw this website called Sorority House Sluts, and all the sluts in that sorority house were super flexible.
And I'm not suggesting that Shane has looked at this particular website, but if he has, all I'm saying is, the young girls are coming for us, you better step up your game.
Oh, man.

[car horn honking] [in unison] Road...
Oh, my God.

Hey, anything for my girl.
Ooh!
Where did you get this?
- And how will Danny Zuko get to heaven?

It's my uncle's.
He sounds rad.

Huh.

Hey, I'm cool.

It was for a school project.
I got a B-minus.
All right.

- Sorry, babe.

Top down, wind on my cheeks.
How is my head scarf gonna fly off my head as I laugh without a care in the world?
[chuckles]
Come on.
So, what am I supposed to do with my long cigarette holder?
Not puff on natural tobacco?
We can't drive with the top down on the freeway.
We'll get shitty gas mileage, bugs in our teeth, and I don't wanna have to yell when I try to explain how agribusiness is crushing the small farmer.
Is it the seventh of the month?

No?

'Cause of my monthly?
[Dax] The driver controls the buttons.
[Annie] You focus on driving.
[Dax] When you talk about corporate greed, you're talking about Monsanto.
- [Annie] Fuck me.

[Annie] Ugh!

[Dax] Locke's ability to walk, Smoke Monster, the DHARMA Initiative,
- how fat man never slimmed down...

What?

[Annie groans]
You want us to come with?
Okay.
Okay.

Yeah.

Yeah.

All right.
[woman] Kick drum, please.
[drum beating]
Floor tom.
[drum beating]
All right, cymbals.
- Whoa!

- Are you okay?

I almost didn't recognize you without your computer.
Left it at home.
This weekend is about you and me.
[Josh] Uh, lover boy?
Testing, one, two.
Testing my patience.
Check, one, two.

Sorry, man.

Sophia, that is Billy, Mickey, and Dr. Josh.
What's up?
Sophia, huh?
Shane won't shut up about you.
Hey, Shane.

Since we've been on tour, have I let you down?
- Tucson.

It's a big city, Tucson.

- Went to three.

- When sound check is done, I have to go.

- to find out if he's a real doctor?

It's cool.

If you swing by Rite Aid, you should pick up a couple Red Bulls, and some Band-Aids, 'cause I'm gonna fuck your dick off.
- Whoa!

[Josh] Talking about a lot of things that are not Claritin-D.
Okay.
[woman on TV] For the weary traveler...
Okay.

I'm worried about this show tonight.

"Huh.

Tonight doesn't matter.

Ooh, okay.

She could really use my support right now.
That prime rib does look world-class.
After that whole umbrella incident, she needs a steady hand on her shoulder, and I can be that hand.
We just have to find her.
We'll start at a Chevron bathroom.
I already got us tickets to the Eames House tour.
Oh, yes, right.
The Eames House.
Hmm.

Yes.
Should I keep pretending to know what that is or...?
It's an icon of mid-century modern architecture.
- Architecture.

The tour would take most of the day, but you're gonna love it.
Wait.

You really think you're gonna meet Katie and Britney wandering the streets?
No.

Or, yeah, whatever.

Okay.

Penny Lane.
You have gotta stop bumping into me.
I'm so happy to meet you.
Do you wanna get inside the music with me?
Oh...

- What do you think you're doing?

She offered them to me.
It would be an insult to her culture not to take them.
Annie, taking mysterious shit from strangers is crazy.
It's not mysterious shit.

No drugs for me.

I thought my first trip with Dax was gonna be amazing, but we're totally not vibing.
Hmm.
You want me to break up with him for you?
"Dax, Annie's dead.

[Annie chuckles]
Man...
I really thought we were soul mates, you know?
- I mean, we both love weekends.

- We're great in the boning department.

Now he wants to go take me to some stupid old boring house.
- To bone?

To, like, look at.
I mean, shit, man.

Stamps, money, insurance commercials, salsa labels...
I don't know.
[Sophia] I'm sorry.
I'm sure tomorrow will be better for you guys.
Yeah.

Go.

Mm-hmm?

Yeah.

Thank you, Los Angeles, I love you.
Could do without those Santa Ana winds, but...
For our next song, our tour manager wanted to do something special for his lady.
So, Shane...
Yeah, everybody, give Shane a hand.
[cheering]
Yes.
Now, all tour long, this guy here has been giving me the D.

What are you doing?
No sorority house sluts are swooping in here stealing my man.
Get over here.
I did it once in high school.

I saw some pretty colors and took a nap on the softball field.
Getting acid from a stranger on a toilet?
Damn it, Annie.

Uh-uh.

Unlike forcing me to use my trip to Tinseltown to look at a house.
You're being so close-minded.
And you're making your gums recede, and there's no cure for that.

This is moronic, and it's not like you, and I forbid you to take that acid.
Oh, you forbid me?
I forbid you.
[scoffs] Okay.
[laughs]
- You took the whole thing?

Call 911.
Whoa, calm down.

Wait.

- Wait.

I don't see it.
Wait.

No.

Holy fuck.
I was just being dramatic to prove a point.
- I was gonna spit it out.

Fuck.

What do I do?

- No.

No.

You were supposed to babysit me.
Oh.

Oh... [chuckles]
It was behind my wisdom tooth.
- No, no.

- Mm-hmm.

- Mm-hmm.

Nope.

Okay.
- Bet it's just paper.

Totally.
This is a bad idea, bad idea, bad idea.
- Stop, stop, stop.

Stop saying "bad idea."
Idea.
Ooh, do I not know what the word "idea" is anymore?
We gotta distract ourselves.
- [woman] Come join us at...

- Where the steaks are world-class...

Do you hear all those dogs?
This isn't like high school at all.
[Shane] Hey.
Wanna take a shower?
[groans] I'm kind of just waking up.
Come on, it'll be fun.
Never, ever... pull a soft hotel comforter off a woman.
Hop on my back, I'll take you.
Get on.
I don't care if you're dead, we're showering together.
That sounded so creepy.
Okay, I know this is fulfilling some fantasy of yours.
Probably a random summer camp memory.

But I'm cold.
Definitely not getting any cleaner.
I could wash your boobs.
Sure, if you're on your way to my pits.
Yeah.
Mm.

All right, let's hit the pool.
We just came from water.

You can't stay at a hotel and not use the pool.
It's like burning money.
Well, unplug the smoke detector, 'cause I'mma light it up.
Okay.
[guitar music playing]
I can feel you moving.
I'm on a boat.
Are you on a boat?
[Annie chuckles]
I am now.
[Dax chuckles]
[Dax gasps]
[Annie] Big Dipper.
[Dax] Little Dipper.
[Annie] Did you just see that?
Is it possible we're seeing the same thing?
Try switching the space for me.
- [Dax] Do you see it?

What is this?
This is Eames.
[Sophia laughs]
- You changed your mind.

Only the survivors of the big one were supposed to see these.
Marco.

Marco.
Marco.
Your girl made another $400.
Minus shipping, minus service fees, minus eBay dipping its beak.
No work.

Okay, but only if I can get in slow.
Get in fast.
Get in fast.

- Ow, ow, ow!

[both laughing]
Okay.
Nice.
Oh, goodness.
[shivering]
[Josh] Yo, lover boy.
- Lover boy.

- I need a cab.

- Whoa, is this for real?

No, I will give you three reasons why it's not cool, doctor.
One, what?
Two, there are plenty of people who work here whose only job is to get cabs, and three, get it yourself, Claritin D-bag.
She's a lot.
I know what you're really after.

You needed a goodbye hug.
Come on.
Tucson is bygones, buddy.
It only took two days to build that frame.
[Annie] How do you know all of this?
Before business school, I took classes in architectural drafting.
I loved it.

We'd put them in these hand-cranked sharpeners.
[whirring]
- It was great.

That's not true.
Are you sure you didn't wanna order any fries from here?
They're so good.

Nah, I'm not that hungry.
All right, your burger will be out soon.
I'm still checking to see if we can make a quesadilla.
I mean, it's just cheese and flat bread, right?
Found this purse the other day, behind this blanket that I'm 99 percent sure a man died under, but the beading on this thing was crazy.
I mean, Bob Mackie meets, I don't know, Jesus' orgasm.
Old-school Gucci, you know?

- by some badass Italian broads.

You should see my apartment.

Totally out of control.

Things are just really blowing up for me.
What's wrong?
That burger sitting weird?
Nothing's wrong.
Yes, there is.
So, just say it.
Hey, I went swimming.
In my undies.
Would you stop pretending to look for something?

I'm looking for my chapstick.
Oh, what, was that the first thing that popped into your head?
Shane.
It was the fries.

- That's what you're pissy about?

Okay.
Sorry I ate too many fries.
They were my fries.

Then you took all of them because that's what you do.
Dude, you're gonna have to learn how to share.
You...

- Which is what?

- It's selfish.

Are you kidding me?

No one always does anything.
Okay, today at the pool, that shit you pull in front of Josh?
Oh, you mean Dr. Josh?
- Yeah.

I would never let anyone speak to me the way he speaks to you.
- Yeah, well, I was doing my job.

You attacked me when I was trying to do my job.
I didn't attack...
You attacked me when I even glanced at my phone.
Don't give me the "doing my job" thing.
Can't you apologize for eating the fries?
- They were just fucking fries!

- Don't tell me what to do.

Oh, I'm bored.

- I'm not gonna do that.

I'm a bitch.

Mm...

Don't do that.

I am so sick of people telling me I'm not a grown-up.
I run a fucking business.

This is insane.
You get that I dropped everything, just to come see you this weekend.
Right?

Mm-hmm.
For what?

I'm a tour manager, Sophia.

Client asked me to get him a cab, I got him a cab, ensuring that he'd wanna work with me again in the future.
It's called professionalism.
Yeah, well, I'd never put up with that.

You would get so fired from my job, because it's not for self-absorbed narcissists.
I would never do your job.
It's a joke.
Fucking glorified errand boy.
Well, thank you for a terrible end to an otherwise great weekend.
Do whatever the fuck you want for the rest of the day.
[Annie] I'm feeling a lot of things right now.
Like what?
Things like... you're embarrassed of me, because you think I'm flighty.
You're not flighty.
You're the fireworks.
You're Pop Rocks.
You're birthday cake, every day of the week.
[chuckles]
Well... then why haven't I met your parents?
We've been together a whole year, and they only live 20 minutes away.
I MapQuested it.
- There's a reason.

I still don't understand the difference between partly sunny and partly cloudy.
Partly cloudy is at night, when there's no sun.
[chuckles]
And you're not dumb.
It took me a long time to figure that cloudy thing out, too.
[laughs]
Well, then what is it?
Well... [sighs] you're white.
And my parents...
It's gonna be this whole thing.
And you don't wanna deal with it, 'cause you're not sure about me.
You're the only thing that I'm sure of.
I just don't wanna deal with it because they're crazy.
[laughs]
I'm serious.
I mean, most black parents are cool with stuff like that, but not my parents.
I'll charm 'em.

I love you, Annie.
I love you, too.
[Lanie Lane's "Heartbeat" playing]
Man, you would've killed it as an architect.
I'm not a very good drawer.
[Annie] Mm.
See, I hold my pencils like this.

You said some pretty mean things up there.
I did.
I get really mad when people are right about me.
Well, I said some pretty mean things up there, too.
Is the only reason we're together because we've been apart for so long?
I don't know.
Do you wanna find out?
Yeah.
[Lanie Lane's "Ain't Hungry" playing]
Come on, get in.
No.
- No, no, no, no!
