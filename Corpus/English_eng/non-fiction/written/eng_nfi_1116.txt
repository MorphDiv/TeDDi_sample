- Hey.

- I'm Nate.

Nice to meet you.

- We doing it?

[Grunts, Exhales Sharply]
Hey, what's your name again?
What do you do for money?
I got a job at this bio-tech pharma company.
You're fired, Nate.
Twins?

I know.

So, when did you get married?
And do you take Robin to be your lawfully wedded wife?
Sí.
And do you, Robin, take Carlos as your lawfully wedded husband?
I...

Who the hell is Carlos?
I married him so that I could help him get his green card, and he paid for my college.
Wait, so guys aren't actually married?
Nope.
No, I couldn't find Carlos to get the annulment before you guys arrived, so we never really got around to doing it.
Nate, I'm guilty.
No, you're not.

You took enough for four people.
Well, drugs are for people.
Wait, so Mom's the loser?
Yes.
Am I in trouble?
We are looking for this woman.
Robin Randall.
AKA...
AKA...
AKA...
Just how well do you know your wife?
Who are you?
I can't tell you.
What's your name?
I can't tell you.
I don't have a name.
What are you, a spy?
No.
You're an assassin.
No.
You're involved in something dangerous.
Uh...
You said you shot someone.
No, I said I may have been involved in some people losing their lives.
So you're a criminal.
Some government agencies have their eye on me.
Should I be afraid of you?
You should be cautious.
God, I am so, so confused right now.
We don't have much more time.
Then tell me.
I can't.
I don't want to play anymore, so tell me.
Listen.

I am done playing this game.
[Timer Rings]
Yes, you are, 'cause your time's up.
She was a mosquito.
I thought that right away.
God, you guys are so intense.
Third question in, you said animal.
A mosquito's not an animal.
Yeah, but it's more an animal than a vegetable or mineral.
What kind of assassin can fly?
Um, all of them, Janice.
You two really pushed the boundaries of yes or no answers. [Laughs]
Oh, really?

We don't write words in Pictionary.
You wrote "Walmart."
It's the sign on the store.
The clue was Walmart.
And it still took you three guesses.
Excuse me, your husband pulled out his you-know-what last week.
Yeah, and I got "nuts" in one guess.
Yeah.

Uh...
What's that?

You look like a mental patient.
Are you...

- What is...

- No props!

You guys are the biggest cheaters we've ever played with.
[Chuckles] Oh, please, Janice.
I think you know a little more about cheating on things than we do.
What?
I think we better call it a day.
[Sighs] I thought they'd worked it out.
It's only been a month.
God, I can't believe we're still living in a trailer park.
And day drinking.
- Playing games on a Wednesday.

Hey, babe.

I mean, it always does, right?
Good things happen to good people.

Yes, I do, amigo!
