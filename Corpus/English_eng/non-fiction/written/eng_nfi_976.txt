[THUNDER CRASHES THEN RUMBLING]
[CASH REGISTER BEEPING]
Hi, you don't happen to have the, um....
The Cross comic.
I'm sorry, what?
The Cross comic.
Uh, which one are you talking about?
Issue two.
Ah....

Do you have what it takes to get that comic?
Yeah.

- Here.

Where did you get this?
My great-grandfather passed it down.
Oh, I see.

Did she just say, "Cross"?

KAI:

Be very careful with it.
This is a one of a kind.
The only issue available.
- Guard it with your life.

- Yeah, I will.

NARRATOR:

So many lives lost in vain.
Deaths of warriors sailors soldiers and the innocent.
[WOMEN SCREAMING]
[♪♪♪]
The wrong place at the wrong time.
NARRATOR:

The gods chose warrior families to protect mankind from the darkest of enemies.
They forged amulets from celestial alloys and armed each family.
The most powerful amulet is the Cross of the Isles.
Armed with the powers of the Cross Callan and his team of weapons experts fight crime in Los Angeles.
But now, an enemy has returned.
And a new enemy has joined him on his quest.
To save the world Callan and his team must fight their biggest battle yet.
- "It's early morning in the high desert."

You-

This is an action comic book.
Let me show you how it's done.
"It's early morning in the high desert.
The sun rises and we see beautiful snowcapped mountains in the distance.
A white SUV travels down the long desert roads."
[♪♪♪]
[TAPPING ON WINDOW]
Let's go, Pizzle-Fire.
Hey, hey.
Crocodile Hunter.
It's Blackfire.
Blackfire.
Get out my way.

Got me in the back like some damn cat.
RIOT:

Shark, you and Lucia take the middle.
Saint, Ranger and I, we're gonna work all the way down the left and forward.
Remember, our Intel has the weapons cache in one of those RV's.
A white one with a brown stripe on the side.
[♪♪♪]
BLACKFIRE:

That tipoff is starting to feel just a little too convenient.
Well, the quicker we can find those guns...
- ...the quicker we get out of here.

Because I'm hungry.
- Hungry?

...flapjacks, bacon, eggs, grits toast, cereal, milk, orange juice, cheese--
And I'm exhausted.
You know, there's nothing more tiresome than eating and drinking.
If it wasn't so daggone good.
- And necessary, of course.

- Okay.

We can find the guns.
Wait.
Shh!
- What?

What?

You forgot pork chops.
[LAUGHING]
Oh, man, that was almost insulting.
You gonna forget my pork chops.

That was the main course.

Something about this place creeps me out.
[♪♪♪]
Yeah, come on in, boys.
Come on in.

My mama used to make pork chops, make these nice pork chops.
She'd fry it up, put gravy on it, had a little fat gristle.
Fat is my favorite.

Eat the meat at the beginning and save fat, know what I mean?
- Right.

You forgot dessert.
Cheesecake.
Cheesecake and strawberry.

I'm getting so hungry I think I wanna kill some bad guys and go to Denny's right now.
This is great.
LUCIA:

This one?
SHARK:

No weapons.
Note.
[GUNSHOTS]
RIOT:

- Party's going.

[♪♪♪]
RIOT:

Three o'clock.
Let's waste these bastards.
Fall back, behind you.
Three o'clock.
Go, go.

Let's go.
Let's go, let's go.
[RIOT SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
Get behind me.
Son of a bitch.

Stay down.
[MAN YELLS]
War, come on.
- Come on, Blackfire, get back here.

Whoo!
Stay down.
Aah.
- Come on.

All right, here we go.
- One more.

RIOT:

Stay down!
[♪♪♪]
[GRUNTS]
[MEN SCREAM]
[MEN SCREAM]
[EXHALES SHARPLY]
You find anything?
- Not even one gun.

You bring my sandwich?
It's all right.
Let's go.
MAN:

What's wrong with you, man?
- I'm just saying.

BLACKFIRE:

[EXPLOSION]
Yeah, that was me.

That was me.

Oh, man.
[♪♪♪]
This was not a set-up.
This was a death sentence.
- But not just us.

Whoever did this didn't care about their own crew.
No loyalty.
CALLAN:

I'm gonna go get Intel.
You're gonna talk to Snitch?
He sold me bad info about a month ago.
WAR:

Getting girls' numbers isn't Intel.
When was the last time you got a number?
- Hey.

- Let's go.

You're so cool, man.
- You're so-

BLACKFIRE:

RIOT:

[♪♪♪]
Damn.
SNITCH:

Does this include the refund from last time?
Gentlemen, this concludes our business for today.
Where'd you get the Intel?
The usual suspects.
Paul tells Ringo, Ringo tells George, George tells me.
- I would have gotten it from John but--

- What?

We got hit.
- A set-up?

Comes with the territory, my friend.
Look, I'm not blaming you.
If I were, you wouldn't be standing, okay?
But I do wanna know where you got the tip from.
Look, if I go around ratting out all of my informants no one's gonna do business with me then where will you get Intel from when you need it?
Who's the boss?
[LAUGHING]
You know I can't do that, Callan.
Look....
I don't pry.
I always pay for the information I get.
But...
- ...if I have to ask you one more time--

Boss' name is Muerte.

Scary guy.
Like Keyser Soze.
A real diablo.
That's all I know, man.
Thanks.
No, uh-

Better get back to my business.
Can't be seen talking to the likes of you.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
[♪♪♪]
Come for the fiber, stay for the taste.
Yum, yum.

- Hmm?

All right.

[LUCIA SIGHS]
You get some Intel?
New boss.
He already has a beef with us.
That's impressive, guys.
Why don't we find him first and beat him to the punch?
I heard this guy's bad.
Real bad.
Well, does this freak have a name?
Muerte.
LUCIA:

Muerte, really?
I mean, that's typical overconfident male.

My guess his mommy didn't play with him enough as a kid.
Fan-freaking-tastic.
Dude named Spanish Death.
Did the Snitch give us a location, or do we have to go looking in hell?
I don't know.
I mean, do what you do.

Fine.

He doesn't seem like the kind of guy we'll be able to tie up till Nitti gets him.
No, it sounds like the type of guy that we need to put down.
- Permanently.

[AX CLANGS]
[LAUGHS]
Seems like everybody's on edge.
I recommend we finish up here and go home and get some shut-eye.
No complaints.
Yeah, I'm beat.
[CALLAN CLEARS THROAT]
Nuke.
- Hold down the fort.

I strive to take my work home, so it's easy to make work my home.
Oh, speaking of work.

Your exploding balls?
Exploding balls.

If that's what you call them.

Everyone calls them that except for me.
Hey, Callan?
Don't go trying to save the world by yourself, okay?
- Okay.

Call us.
[♪♪♪]
All right, boys and girls.
Who the hell is this guy anyway?
Doesn't he know we run L.A.?
- No one tells us what to do in our town.

I say we kill him.
Show him who's boss.
Send a message to the next guy who thinks he can call a mandatory meeting.
Dangerous.

I'd like to have a long night with him.
[SCOFFS]
Ladies, lowlifes, and soon to be dead....
GRIME:

Who you calling a lowlife?
Who gave you that name, Muerte, anyway?
Your dishrag mother didn't love you...
- ...enough?

Muerte's Spanish for "death," you idiot.
Oh.
Oh, I see.
I'm supposed to be afraid of you.
You're a scary guy?

You want me to kill him, boss?
You're, um....

Heh.
I don't know you.
- What name do you go by?

I go by Grime.
- Grime.

That's like that dirty little grease spot in the oven.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
[GASPING]
[♪♪♪]
[BONES CRACKING]
Anyone else?
- Poor bastard.

Good.
Now that we have an understanding, here's what I want.
I want anyone that stands in our way dead.
Now, is that clear enough?
Huh, comprendes?
Nod if you understand.
Now to own a city, you have to be the strongest in a city and to be the strongest in a city you have to kill the strongest in the city.
- Agreed?

Absolutely.
Yeah, what about Callan?
Let Callan live.
But the Cross team, they have to die.
And anyone that's in bed with them is dead.
There's a lot of cash to be acquired.
And we don't want anybody getting in our way.
Lots of people want the Cross team dead.
What's so special about this guy?
I don't know.

- What's with all the questions?

We've all been down that road before and it didn't really work out because, see, 70 percent of my crew got whacked.
The rest moved out of town.
I had to build a whole new gang.
Yeah.
This time it's gonna be different.
I lost a crew this morning.
But the four of you, with your gangs together it'll all be over by morning.
We kill the Cross team, our investor will take care of Callan.
With all due respect that still won't be good enough.
I have a couple of aces up my sleeve.
Kade, Jax.
Just point at the target.
And we kill the target.
I like it.
Now with all of you and your teams united this will be doable.
Oh, and one more thing.
I get 60 percent of the take from now on.
- Ugh.

[SIGHS]
Now go kill them.
And don't come back till it's done.
Let's go, girls.
Hey, slick.
Bring me some Trejo's tacos.
Muerte is a really bad guy.
Yeah.

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
Callan, where you been?
Working nights.
- Still stocking?

I love groceries.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
I ordered your fave when you came in.

- Thank you.

Old flame?
Uh-

- Anything else would be a crime.

April.
You staying out of trouble?
- Trying.

[♪♪♪]
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
[RILEY SIGHS]
Hey, pretty lady.

I said what you drinking?
Hey.
My boy's talking to you.

[MAN GROANING]
[♪♪♪]
[MEN GRUNTING]
- Oh!

I use what works.
Yeah, as long as it's fighting and not a relationship.
- I had to leave, okay?

- I'll have what they're having.

[SIGHS]
Well, that ought to do it.
Should we go?
Yeah, the rest should be showing up soon.
I'll clean it up.

Does everybody know?
CALLAN:

RILEY:

Meet you there.
[CRUNCHING]
Mm.
[MOANS]
[COMPUTER BEEPING]
Oh.

[♪♪♪]
Oh, boy.

Oh.
This isn't good.

[BEEPING RAPIDLY]
Come on.

Come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
[BEEPING]
[ZYPHER WHISTLING]
- Nuke-y.

Come out, come out, wherever you are.

ZYPHER:

[ZYPHER WHISTLING]
Come here, Nuke, Nuke, Nuke-y.
Oh, Nuke?
[♪♪♪]
I don't see this son-of-a-gun anywhere.
Oh, no, the jackpot, man.


Man, this guy is a slob.
- Look at the-

He's got something in here.

Wait, wait, wait.
That's us.
Look, he's been watching us the whole time.
Aw, man.
All right, he's gotta be around here somewhere.

[FAINT BEEPING]
Wait.
What's that beeping noise?
It's coming from over here.
[BEEPING CONTINUES]
- Hmm.

Uh-uh.
[IN UNISON] Oh, crap.
[BEEPING RAPIDLY]
Did Nuke make it out alive?
Well, he is the smart one, so I hope he finds a way out.
[♪♪♪]
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
RILEY:

CALLAN:

Still coming to my rescue.
Listen, I--
I know we haven't talked much since--
We've been pretty busy, yeah.
Team's been getting shot at daily.
Someone's gotta get the bad guys, right?
I'm sure Nitti's busy.
Nitti.
God, that man must love what he does.
He's definitely not doing it for the money.
None of us are.
We do it because it's right.
Listen.
This new guy.
He's no joke, okay?
Snitch told me his name.
[SIGHING]
He's nobody to be messed with.
What's his name?
- Muerte.

Could you get any more cliché than that?
It's a clichéd town.
True.
[PHONE RINGS]
- Yeah?

- Who?

I'm guessing our new secret admirers.
Status?
I blew it to fragments.
Anything left?
Well, me, and every bit of our digital world.
CALLAN:

Let's meet at L-37.
Copy that.

[♪♪♪]
Three times today.
This morning, with you at the bar and my hide-out.
Self-destruct?
- Mm-hm.

Dude really knows how to make an explosive exit.
CALLAN:

Why come after the two of us?
- I haven't heard any chatter.

I mean, he obviously wants both of us out of the way.
We only have two things in common.
I mean, we both protect the city and....
[CHUCKLES]
It's been a long time since we had that in common.
It's a great conversation starter, though.
Yeah.
Listen, Muerte he's on a roll.
Who's he working with?
I thought you and Erlik had an "agreement"?
We do.

It's not his style.
Well, then whose style is it?
- I don't know.

So ever think about us and the way we...?
Look, Riley, we had something amazing, okay?
But, I mean, there's no safety in our job, right?
We don't know if we'll be home or not.
I know that.
I've always known that.
When I got hurt and you didn't think I'd make it you totally disconnected from me friends, family, everyone.
[SIGHS]
Your team good?
Yeah, team's good, everyone's healthy.
Flying under the radar.
Fighting crime for free.
I miss you.
Why don't you and your team stay with me?
- Are you serious?

Well, that's like moving in together.
I'm serious, okay?

So I'm gonna go.

I'm glad we had this talk.
- Give me all your money.

- Boy.

I'm gonna give you to the count of three to get that knife off of my neck.
One.
Two.
Three.
[SIGHS]
[ENGINE STARTS]
What?
[GRUNTS]
No way.

That's what her amulet does.
[SIRENS WAILING]
[SIRENS WAILING]
MAN:

Afraid there's nothing left but a pair of boots and scrap metal.
Apparently, the fire set off a bunch of grenades.
Not grenades, they were Blackfire's balls.
I've heard about your theories.

Yeah, we wonder about you sometimes, Nitti.
Good evening, Detective Nitti.

Looks to get busier.
Callan's team is changing locations.

Still chasing, right?

Making any progress?
Same as always.

I'm sure.

I'm gonna look for some gremlins.
Good luck.
Well, here we are.
Yep.

So, what's your story, Nitti?
I mean, if Cross and his team are the good guys, right then why are you dead set on catching them?
I don't like competition.
I've heard that about you.

By the way, it's no competition.
Cross and his team catch a lot more bad guys than you do.
Hm.
[CLICKS TONGUE]
BLACKFIRE:

RIOT:

There we go.

Pizzle-Fire, put that back.
This is nice.
RIOT:

All right, vests on this end.
All right, folks, load the mags.
We got a lot of work to do.
- All right, look at that, huh?

RIOT:

- Here's your battleax, brother.

Fix the stock on this one here.
So only the necessities, huh?
Yeah.

- As you do.

[GUN COCKS]
It's what we're doing.
Welcome home, guys.
The ultimate man cave.
Nothing but bricks, cement and me.
Yo, yo.

I could too.
- Yeah, yeah.

Uh-uh.

It just, you know....
Pizzle-Fire.
You drop your balls one more time I'm gonna shove them up your turd-cutter for safekeeping.
- You got me?

- He'll do it.

Okay, I'm gonna get to work.

Muerte sends his regards.
His final regards.
[♪♪♪]
JAX:

[INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]
NITTI:

What have we got?
An anonymous call.

- How many dead?

I'll play that game.

JESSIE:

None.
- Erlik?

- Really?

Someone finally got to him.
It doesn't make any sense.
Erlik was playing it cool.

It takes big kahunas to put a hit on Erlik.
NITTI:

Any suspects?
Not yet, but I'll figure it out.

It'd be a big reason to take out the crime boss.
There's gonna be a ripple effect.
Sure will.

It wasn't your grim Robin Hood.

She knows you well.

Who knows?

They take out the trash.
Not a chance.

This wasn't Cross or the Mickey Mouse Girls Club.
They had a truce.

Great, now the whole world's gonna know.
Who's our lucky winners tonight?
This is not good, Lisa.
Do tell.
Someone took out the whole crew.

- Erlik?

I don't believe it.
Neither did I.
- Who would do such a thing?

- Cross?

Let's go find some bad guys.
Isn't that what you pretty girls do?

[♪♪♪]
[PEOPLE GRUNTING THEN GUINEVERE CHUCKLES]
Hey.

If you did, give them my number.
JANE:

You know, I beat down three thugs last night for purse-stealing.
I'm pretty sure I'm old enough.
Give them my number instead.
I haven't seen a cute guy in months.
Ladies!

There's a new guy in town.
And he's killing all the good guys.
One by one.
- Who is this guy?

He goes by Muerte.
Him and his goons are already after us.
They attacked me and Callan at a bar tonight.
Whoa.

Yeah.

Ran into him at the bar.
He said his guys were ambushed this morning.
So what?

As do we.
Guinevere, I'm not playing.

They can get in line, because lots of people want us dead.
You don't get it.

I don't know, call it a hunch.

So, what do you want us to do?
Strike first.
We get them before they get us.
Ha.

I'm in.

Yeah, I'm ready.
We could start by cutting off their heads.
- You know, Bloody Mary style.

Or we could capture and torture them.

Ladies!

We're gonna stay with them.
We're stronger in numbers.
That's ridiculous.

We are the protectors.
Come on.

- ...to listen to chocolate-fire talk.

- He's kind of cute.

- ...and you listen to him.

- He's got a few good jokes.

Calm it down!

Now, Riley has never steered us wrong.
Besides, it's always a good idea not to get too comfortable.
If you want to make it through we need to stick together.
The last place any of you want to be is on the dying end of a kill.
[♪♪♪]
Hey, man, spare some change?
Hey, he's talking to you.
MAN:

Give me your change!
[WEAPON SLASHING AND MAN SCREAMING]
CALLAN:

This place should be fully operational by morning.
So work fast.
Oh, you guys take a break.

A little work goes a long ways.
You keep your head in the game.
And out of your ass.
Out of my ass.
They came for Riley.

SAINT:

Whoa.
What are you talking about, Riley?
Where'd you see her?
Peter's Bar.
Ran into her there.
You ran into her?

- ...ran into her with one leg up?

I was just trying to make light-

Pretty damn brave of them to come after you both at the same time.
Two amulets together, that's some pretty hot firepower.
Yeah, you guys were quite the fighting pair, remember?
I don't think they knew that I was there.
RIOT:

They only sent four guys.
[RIOT CHUCKLES]
So I told Riley to come stay here with her team.
Yeah.
We need to watch them.
Whoa, whoa.

- ...the last time you did that?

You know, it's not a bad idea.
With Guinevere and everyone.
- She's pretty hot.

LUCIA:

SHARK:

No.
[PHONE RINGS]
- Yeah?

I, uh, found something you'll definitely be interested in.
All right.

Don't be late.
[KEYPAD BEEPS]
That was the Snitch and he has some Intel.

Watch your back.
Off so soon?

You just got here.

- I make a mean guac.

[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
Hey.
Heard some bums got beat up pretty bad.
Beat up?

Did you get any DNA evidence off the confiscated items?
- There's gonna be trouble with that.

Well, when I came back from upstairs, stuff was missing.
Missing?

Well, I came back and it was all gone.
No idea what happened.
No one has a key to get in here.
What exactly is missing?
Well, everything.

Nothing left but belly lint and, uh, blood.
Have any idea who took it?
NITTI:

The Snitch.
- The Snitch?

Had to be someone with inside contacts.
Some law-breaking worthless bastard.
- Yeah.

[♪♪♪]
Callan.

[PHONE RINGS]
- Hello?

- Yeah.

Ready to rock.
I got the Intel.

Roger that.

We'll be there in a few.

- Callan, I--

Be ready for anything.
Okay.

[KEYPAD BEEPS]
- You okay?

- To be ready.

MARGO:

- ...are you?

You can handle yourself in a fight.
But handling your feelings for Callan is a whole different story.
I'll be fine.
That's what you said last time.
And then he almost died.
Yeah.

Girls, listen.

GIA:

Ladies, make me proud.
Cold hard steel.

Mm-hm.

- Gunnar's back.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

- Did you see him?

- Explain, please.

Huh?
What the...?
He, uh....
He chopped up these homeless guys downtown.
Trusted Intel?
Snitch.
That's impossible.

- They couldn't even identify him.

I heard about that.

That he's gonna live forever or until everyone dies.

- I mean, we're still alive, so....

Then we'll have to find another way to stop him.
Okay, Nuke.

Um....
I probably have something I can modify.

It'll take some work.

- We don't have any time.

Just think of some lightning and thunder and mix it up--
Guys, guys, I'll figure it out.

In the meantime, you go kick him, shoot him, thump him and pound him.
- Thump him?

Just don't kill him.
He's gotta be working with Muerte.
I mean, it's his normal M. O.
Callan.
Hang tight.

Ah.

Welcome back to the temporary land of the living.
You look great for someone who's been dead forever.
- Moisturizer.

Right on time, my friend.

Yeah, it's not my first rodeo.
Is it nearly ready?
Rome wasn't built in a day.

It took a lot longer than that.
Those were the days, huh?
Did you follow my instructions?
Absolutely.
And Muerte?
As we speak, I'm working on it.

But he won't be able to spend it.
[SNORTS AND LAUGHS]
Poor chap.

Did you get everything you needed?
I got all the elements.
All we need is more power.
We'll have more power than you ever thought of.
Last time it didn't go the way we planned.
But you're lucky you have me, and I have plan B.
I see you've been living like a king.
Like an American president.
Fast cars, fast girls.

Thanks for the bank card.
And all this just from one little machine.
This little machine.
This little machine creates a swarm of free-flying quarks.
And do I look like the kind of guy that reads up on flying quarks?
Did you hear what I said?
Free-flying quarks?
I don't care as long as we can kill everybody and I can finally die.
- How long will it take?

Not long, my friend.
Every atom in the universe will be destroyed.
And you're willing to end it all for one peek of the end?
It's actually a peek of beginning.
Now get this machine working.
I'm on it.

You know?

The snacks too.

RIOT:

Ready, Pizzle-Fire?
Because hell's coming.
SHARK:

Can't kill him.
I'm not worried.
Just, he's just gonna die and reincarnate.
Or some freaky shit.

I'm ready.

You don't understand.

It just comes right back.
We're in luck.

- You okay?

Riley said they were coming, and we completely blew it off.
They ambushed us.

- I'll get her back.

- She's our girl.

We're helping.
Let's do it.
Go.
MARGO:

- Will Callan save Riley?

They make a pretty good team.
[MUERTE LAUGHS]
Well, look at you.
You brought a pretty penny.
All that money.
For you and this amulet.
[CHUCKLES]
- Get your hands off me.

Better save that energy, honey.
I understand you're going to quite the party.
Take her to Gunnar.
And bring back our money.
Oh, yeah.
Don't forget this.
Things are starting to get interesting.

Gunnar's gonna enjoy you.
KONRAD:

Almost ready to be tested.
The bait will be here soon and Callan will come running.
You have special hate for that guy.
- I like it.

First thousand years I lived to love.
It was the second thousand years I lived to hate.
Done.

Well, let's see a sample.
- Ready?

[MACHINE POWERING UP]
Good.

Now let's see its potential.
[CONTINUES POWERING UP]
[HUMMING]
[CHUCKLING]
Will that machine destroy the whole world?
That machine is gonna destroy the whole universe and everything in it.
Whoa.
[PHONE RINGING]
Yo.
Yeah.
Okay, don't worry.

All right.
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready.
It's time to go to work.
So get all your weapons together.
It's gonna be a long night.
[GUN COCKS]
WOMAN:

Whoa!
How does it work?
That's a great question.
Come closer.

Come here.
Does it feel good?
You won't feel a thing.
[MACHINE WHIRRING]
- Wow.

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING THEN CRASHES]
- Lt tingles.

Wha--?
Oh....

[SCREAMING]
Goodbye to the world, hello to the end.
Listen, we just got this new place and he's already inviting guests.
It won't be long before we're looking for a new hideout.
I mean, what is the purpose of having a hideout if we don't hide?
You know, you could always hide.

That's real funny.

Hey, the bad guys got Riley.

Not good enough, Jack.
Pizzle-Fire.
Now, if Callan says they're cool they're cool.
- Plus, we need the manpower.

- Got it?

I don't care if they the Marines.
I need my sleep.
- Boys.

He grabbed me first.
Listen, we need to focus on getting Riley back safely.
That's what we're doing, okay?
Regardless of all that, I'm just--
I'm just not ready for any new teammates.
I have enough trouble with the ones I have.
Like Quiet Riot here.
- You want to bang your head?

- I could help you feel the noise.

I'm not a rock star.

Listen here, Duck Dynasty, I'm--
Hey!
Callan, what's going-- We was just talking about you, man.
The guac I said I was gonna make it's in the fridge, you know?

Oh, hey-

Oh, this is--
Oh.

Yes.

Ladies, hey, how you doing?
Welcome.

You guys look nice.
You know, maybe like the housewives of Rambo but we can deal with that.
We can deal with that.

Um, you guys may have heard of me.
Um....
I'm Blackfire, resident explosives expert.

Y'all know what I mean?

Puke, these ladies look like they need some water.
Can you get them a round?

Your legs ain't broke.

- Not Puke.

Fizzle-Fire, when's your cousin getting back?
Oh, he's spending some time with our aunt.

- Um--

- I was just trying to--

Ladies.
I heard you had a rough night.

- I heard you had a rough morning.

We're going back out tonight.
Exact a little payback.
You all up for it?
We're always in.
That's good to hear.
All right.
I see you met Pizzle-Fire here.
Riot.
[RIOT SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
Make yourselves at home.

- Thanks for having us.

[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
- What happened?

Yeah, they had these two giants covered in armor from head to toe.
Bullets didn't faze them, not at all.
It's like they weren't human.
Oh, they're human.
I'll prove it.
Her shield couldn't hold up to one of them and he took off with her.
I mean, for giants, they move really quick.
She didn't have a chance to freeze motion.
- She really can do that?

- Man, I gotta see that, because I like....

[BLACKFIRE CLEARS THROAT]
[COMPUTER BEEPING]
We-

We got-

RIOT:

I'm sure of it.

We need a plan.
We have one.
We kill Gunnar, we get her back, and put a muzzle on him.
What?
LUCIA:

How's that gadget?
I think it works.
What do you mean "you think"?
Just test it, Nuke.
I can't test it.
It only works once.
So make it count.

Just how I like it.

Just suck the life out of the Earth and send it off into the abyss.
No sounds, no soul.
Not even a light.
You certainly do like to settle the score.
A little friend of mine, he never left a score unsettled.
Neither do I.
There's been a lot of mass killers in history.
But you are the greatest one.
I'm not a mass killer.

There won't be anyone to notice.
Finally the end.
I'll get the front row seat.
GUNNAR:

Welcome, gents.
Welcome, young lady.
[GASPING]
Hey.
That's no way to hold a lady.
Now put her down gently.
Yeah, right.

[GROANS]
Now let me introduce myself.

I'm the last person you're ever gonna meet.
Yeah.

I'd hate to have such a terrible finish.
Quite feisty.

Ah.
I'll keep hold of this for a bit.
Just until your little boyfriend Callan gets here.
Yeah, that's right.
You see, I know everything because I've been around a long, long time.
When he gets here, I'm gonna kill him I'm gonna kill you, and you can be together forever.
Now I've got your attention.
How does this thing work, anyhow?
It's gonna kill Callan.
How does it do it?
That's a good question.
It's powered by the amulet, which is powered by Riley.
So, coincidentally, Riley will end up killing Callan.
Not bad.
Oh, you're a monster!
Callan will stop you.
That's it.

How will Callan find us?
Oh, we left him a little calling card.
Yeah.

Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.
RIOT:

This is obviously a trap.
We're all gonna be walking in but I ain't sure if we're walking out.
Yeah.

The Joker sets a trap, and he walks right into it.
I always thought--
He's supposed to be the world's smartest detective.
- I never really got that, right?

- Are you done?

You know, this is personal.

Well, regardless of whatever his final motivations are he wants revenge first.
Wish him luck.
I wish him dead.
Sounds nasty.

You don't know him like we do.
He has Riley.
And there is only one way we're getting her back.
Walk right into a trap.
Exactly.
- I like his style.

Not a damn thing.
Don't mistake style for overconfidence.
I mean-

All right, listen up.
Once we get inside, we're gonna split up then we're gonna find these bastards and waste them, plain and simple.
It sounds like a good plan.
We'll clear the way, and hopefully Callan will get his girl back.
Why are we worried about Callan getting his girl?
We're up here risking our lives for him?

There's only one girl so we all know who'll get the girl:

A nice, fine girl.

I'm tired of this.

"Where's Blackfire at?" Y'all gonna--

RIOT:

If you can't keep your mouth closed I got something to stick in your ball washer.
Ball washer?
Why you always have to say something so nasty?
Ball washer?

You always wanna stick something in something.
That's why he always keep them gloves on.
Don't touch me.
Will you let him touch you with his stinky fingers?
Stop talking.
[BEEPING RAPIDLY]
[MONITOR BEEPING]
He's here, right on time.
- ls the machine ready?

Once you add the second power source the gauge hits a hundred percent, press the button.

You did good, bubba.

Beautiful.
Oh.

- Ha-ha-ha!

They know we're coming.

Let's go.
All right.

Here's to maximum violence.
No hesitation, no mercy.

Stay sharp.
And watch each other's six.

RANGER:

Saint, Lucia with me.
LUCIA:

You ain't gotta tell me twice.

Heh, heh.

Hey, good luck, blue balls.

Oh, well, we got luck.

Somebody's gotta protect the girls.
- No.

No.

RIOT:

Head on a swivel.

RIOT:

[SCREAMS]
[GRUNTING]
MAN:

[BOTH GRUNTING]
On your six.
Listen.
Don't get too far behind.
- Harrison!

You call me Blackfire.

All right.

- What?

Exploding ordinance.
Yeah.

- I told you.

[♪♪♪]
- Oh....

I saw bad guys.
Good.

- Now let's go get them.

- Thirty-three?

- Do you know what 33 guys looks like?

Thirty-three Shaq-looking guys up in there.
I'm not talking about the Shaq now.

When he broke the glass.

Count them again.
- You need me to count them again?

I'll help.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
- That's about 30 people.

MAN 1:

- If we separated earlier...

...we would know exactly....
- I think we should back up.

Like out into the street.
What color was it?
Cotton candy?

MAN 1:

- We should probably go.

[EXPLOSION]
- War and Blackfire are funny.

If you like food.
[♪♪♪]
[BLOWS]
You okay, Jane?
Next time, you be the bait.
Can I shoot the next one?
Margo, let's get to work.
On it.

[LAUGHS]
SAM:

Three hot chicks.
I mean, I don't know whether to kill them or date them.
You know, we got, what's this?

Is it Project Runway?
[SAM MIKE LAUGHING]
You know what?

- I mean, you already know.

Sure.

- Yeah.

Okay.

I bet....
- What's your name?

Mike.
Mike.

I bet that in less than six seconds you and your little friends will be on the ground, bloody and dead.
[♪♪♪]
[LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY]
In six seconds?
In six--
[CONTINUE LAUGHING]
The little one.
Yeah. okay, you-- Whatever, yeah.

- Okay.

- Five.

- Three.

One.
We're still here.
- I think that was seven seconds.

Who's counting?

[♪♪♪]
[GUNSHOTS]
Hey, you guys seen Gunnar?
That's a no.
[GUNS COCK AND MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY]
Well, well, look who we have here.
Don't move.

You too!
I'll-

Come here.

I think we should tie them up.

Turn around.

Turn around, all three of you.

Can you let me have some fun?
Hey, ladies.
- Looks like you needed help.

It's about time.
Let's go find the boys.
Too bad.

[YELLING]
RANGER:

- You all right?

[SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY]
Get your hand grenades out.
All right, here we go.
Left!
[RIOT SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY]
Here we go!
MAN:

Go, go, go!
[YELLING]
[♪♪♪]
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Welcome, friends.
And Callan.
Just in time for the show.
- You good?

Welcome to the show.

I'm sure you're gonna see it's gonna be a big show-stopper.
Oh, good one, Gunnar.
Did you practice your one-liners when you were dead?
[GUNNAR CHUCKLES]
So I guess now you're gonna believe me when I tell you I can't die.
We really gonna do this again?
Oh, absolutely.
Let's just say you beat me this time.
What are you gonna do?
You gonna blow up the world?
Oh, yeah.

So this is just some personal desire?
There's no honor in that.
Honor?

How can you talk about honor when you lead your team in there, and Riley to their death?
Where's the honor in that?
Okay.

We're gonna stop you all of you and then we're gonna show no mercy.
And I thought you were just here to rescue your little girlfriend.
I mean, I don't see much too special in her.
- Go to hell!

First you're gonna pay for what you did last time.
And, Callan just in case you're thinking that you can use her power towards her amulet not gonna happen.

If she powers up before I press this button the power will go straight through her skull frying her brain.
Poof.
[SNICKERS]
Let her go and I'll make this as painless as possible.
You're in no position to make deals, my friend.
[♪♪♪]
So, Callan we've taken the power of her amulet.
Now we're gonna take yours so you aren't such a nuisance to me.
You guys, um you want to take the big elephants there?
Yeah.
Look, it's the ex-preacher.
Did the word get too heavy?

Proverbs:

I guess you're in trouble.
KADE:

Okay.
Have it your way.
I think I'll have some fun.
[BOTH GRUNTING]
[GRUNTING]
On the day of judgment, you will give account for every careless word you speak.
[CALLAN GASPING]
No!
Stop!

GUNNAR:

[BOTH GRUNTING]
[ANKLE CRACKS AND GUNNAR GROANS]
Yes.
KONRAD:

[GUN COCKS]
I wouldn't do it if I were you.
[PANTING]
All right, have a seat with your girlfriend.
Cuff him.
That should do the trick, shouldn't it?
KADE:

Wire him up.
JAX:

That's exactly what's gonna kill them.
[KEYBOARD CLACKING]
It's ready.
Good job, Konrad.
Well, this is goodbye, Callan.
You've been a worthy opponent, but somebody had to lose.
RILEY:

[♪♪♪]
[MACHINE POWERING UP]
[GRUNTS]
I can stop it.
You can't.

It's gonna kill me anyway.
[GRUNTING]
All of us.
- I'll stop it.

[CHUCKLING]
[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING AND CRASHING]
[SCREAMING]
[BOTH SCREAMING]
No!
[RILEY CALLAN GRUNTING]
[MACHINE POWERING DOWN]
[RILEY CONTINUES GRUNTING]
[HUMMING]
[GRUNTING]
[LUCIA SAINT SCREAMING]
[♪♪♪]
You're right.
Someone has to lose.
Why doesn't Callan just destroy Gunnar?
Because he's immortal.

It's ready.
Good job, Konrad.
Well, this is goodbye, Callan.
You've been a worthy opponent, but somebody had to lose.
RILEY:

[♪♪♪]
[REMOTE BEEPING]
- What happened?

The machine is perfect.

It's supposed to work.
It's supposed to work.
I'm sure you're wondering what went wrong how I beat you again.
Well....
It looks like I have the upper hand.
But this time, it's a royal flush.
Well, I don't play cards.
Is that a new toy?
No.
[REMOTE BEEPS]
What is this?
This will never hold me.
I'll see you in a million years or so.
No.

I'm out of here.
Me too.

[♪♪♪]
[RILEY CLEARS THROAT]
Keys?
- Hey, guys.

Hey, it's the Spice Girls.

- Yeah, we're good.

Yeah.

It seems to be pretty busy, right?
Yeah, we just took out, like, 17 guys.
Well, that's it?

- And here we go.

You are just trying to one-up us.
I'm not trying to one-up you.

He can go all night.
[BLACKFIRE GRUNTING]
- And here we go.

And then I got the balls, like, here, here I come.
- Here I come.

BLACKFIRE:

- You guys seen Callan?

- No, I haven't.

Let's go find them, guys.
I don't want to, I want to go home.

- Blackfire.

I'm tired of this mission.
[♪♪♪]
They should make a movie out of this comic book.
Yeah, they should.

Well, ladies, we just got our edge.
[OBJECT HUMMING]
- ls that what I think it is?

Another amulet?
[MUERTE LAUGHING]
[♪♪♪]
Believe me.

Does Callan and Riley get back together?
Does Blackfire go back to his city?
Patience.

After all, there is another amulet.
Now let's get you to bed because you have school tomorrow.
Oh, fine.
