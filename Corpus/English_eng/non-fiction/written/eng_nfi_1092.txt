♪♪
Listen up, people.

J'Son, aka my jerk of a dad, has five Centurion helmets.
Incredibly powerful objects in the wrong hands...
AKA my dad's hands... could be used to take over the galaxy.
We need to find our friend Adam Warlock, the only being who could stand up to the power of those helmets.
And how do we do that, Quill?
It ain't like the guy left us a krutackin' forwarding address.
Good point, Rocket.
But we do know people who've mentioned myths from their home worlds about Warlock.
One of them, unfortunately, no longer has his original home world to investigate.
[SIGHS]
I am Groot.
Which leaves us with one last option.
[BEEPS]
That's a stretch even for you, Quill.
If Drax knew something about how to contact Warlock, why not mention it before?
Because, Gamora, I did not wish to speak of it.
You've been holding out on us, ya big, green cue ball?

But I have no liquid to spill.
It's a metaphor, dummy!
It means tell us what you know before I blast it outta ya!
It will take more than feeble threats to get me to admit that my planet has a temple that, according to legend, contains a beacon that can summon the Warlock.
O-kay.
So, I'm thinking we set a course for Drax's home world now.
Absolutely not.
I refuse to return there under any circumstance!
Nor will I discuss the matter any further!
But...

Hey!

[BREATHING HEAVILY]
Okay.

[MAN] ♪ Love's a roller coaster... ♪
These words make no sense.
How can love be a roller coaster when one can neither see, nor touch it?
It's a song, Drax.

Really?

You just have to crank it up [VOLUME INCREASES] and tune out the rest of the world.
Okay, set a course for Drax's home world.
♪♪[CONTINUES] What?

I am Groot.
Of course it's dishonest.

[DRAX YAWNING]
[GASPS, SNIFFS]
Quill!

You deceived me!
I would recognize my home planet's scent anywhere!
I'm sorry, man.
I didn't wanna lie, but the universe... kind of in mortal danger right now.
And look, we didn't think you'd come if we told the truth.
You are correct.
There's a lot more at stake than you not wanting to face your past.
[GROWLS]
[DRAX] Behold, the Temple of the Destroyer!
Everybody else just seeing a rock wall?
The temple lies beyond the rock wall.
Only one can pass through it to the sacred space within... the Destroyer.
[FEMALE VOICE] Imposter!

You are not the Destroyer.
I am the Destroyer.
[GRUNTS]
*MARVEL'S GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY* Season 02 Episode 18 Title: "Destroyer"
[GRUNTING]
You should never have returned, Drax!
[GRUNTING]
[STRAINING]
Xeron, cease this attack.
I mean you no harm.
[ROCKET YELLS] [SCREAMS]
That makes one of us!

[GRUNTING] You think you can bribe me with this delicacy?
It is not even cooked!
[WHIRRING] I'll show ya cooked!
[GRUNTS] Do not interfere!
This is my fight and mine alone!
For once we agree, Drax the Traitor.
Only a coward lets others fight their battles.
Well, that's just too bad, lady, 'cause we're the Guardians, and we stick together!
What do your adhesive properties have to do with this fight?
Oh, great.

[BOTH GRUNTING]
[GROANS]
That's it!

[BOTH GRUNTING]
I am Groot!
[GRUNTING]
[CRIES OUT]
You may have secured victory, Drax, but you did so without honor.
Which is why I am the one true Destroyer.
Isn't that more of a Drax thing?
[SPITS]
He insults our sacred traditions by bearing that title.
And to return now, of all times, with the Warlock upon us.
So you know about Warlock.
It is my sworn duty.
When the Warlock returns, the Destroyer must enter the temple to summon him with the sacred beacon, and destroy him.
Okay, you had me at "summon," then you lost me at "destroy."
Xeron, there is much we must discuss in regard to the Warlock.
I have nothing to discuss with a heretic who turned his back on his duty to pursue fame and fortune.
That is not true!
I did it for love.
[ONLOOKERS CHEERING]
There was a time when being crowned Destroyer meant everything to me.
Xeron and I trained together, competing for this highest honor among our people.
[GRUNTS]
Eventually, the time came when I was given what I desired most.
[ONLOOKERS CHEERING] I became Drax the Destroyer.
[CHEERING CONTINUES]
Though fate had other plans for me.
I knew the Destroyer was forbidden to have a family, but I could not deny my feelings for Ovette.
So we fled our home, never to return.
You swore an oath, Drax.
The bonds of friends and family make you weak.
The Destroyer walks alone.
And I have.

I am vexed that my feelings for them can bring such happiness and also such pain.
Well, maybe because love is like a roller coaster?
Metaphor.

I do not care for your meaningless words.
I became Destroyer in your absence, but only by default.
I could never live up to your legacy.
[CRIES OUT] Only the true Destroyer can enter the temple.
Then perhaps, for all my sins,
I am still the true Destroyer?
[CRIES OUT]
[SIGHS] Just once, couldn't these mystic mumbo jumbo prophecies come with an instruction manual?
The instructions are clear.
We must battle to the finish so the true Destroyer may be revealed.
[DRAX GRUNTS] No!

[BOTH GRUNTING]
[GRUNTING CONTINUES]
Drax!
We are inside the Temple of the Destroyer.
Unacceptable.
Only one can enter the temple.
It is written.
And yet there are two.
Which means someone here does not belong.
[QUIETLY] I am Groot.
[RUMBLING]
[THUNDEROUS MALE VOICE] Heed me.
I am the Sphinx, and this is my test.
The best answer destroys the question.
What walks on four legs n the morning, two legs at midday, and three in the evening?
[QUIETLY] Oh, it's a riddle.
[QUIETLY] Not just a riddle, a metaphor.
They're flarged.
It is a trial.
The temple seeks to find the true Destroyer.
You, Sphinx, bring me this many-limbed creature, and I will dispatch it.
I do not think there is a creature.
It sounds more like a metaphor.
Enough with your strange words!

[YELLS]
[WEAPON CLANGS] [GRUNTS]
[GRUNTS, GROANS]
All you have done is trigger a trap!
A trap that will end us both!
Xeron!
[GRUNTS]
[GRUNTS]
Do not touch me!
Did I do something wrong?
You interfered.
Have you forgotten our ways completely?
The Destroyer walks alone!
That has not been my experience.
Friends and allies have helped me in the past.
Although, clearly, they will not help me solve this riddle.
"It walks on four legs in the morning, two at midday, and three in the evening."
What creature has such attributes?
Oh, hang on.

It's man!
Because he starts out crawling as an infant... four legs.
Then walks on two.
Then needs a cane in old age...

[CHUCKLES] I am Groot.
Yeah.

Look!

Or perhaps it is because I destroyed the trap?
[XERON] Which path do we take now?
[SPHINX] Until I am measured I am not known, yet how you miss me when I have flown.
What am I?
A new metaphor.
Enough games!
I am the Destroyer, and the Destroyer acts!
No, Xeron!

[GASPS]
[GASPS]
[RUMBLING]
[BOTH GRUNT] [RUMBLING CONTINUES]
Quill, "measured," "flown"...
The answer is time.
Great.

[QUILL] Drax, you're running out of time to solve this riddle!
How do you know I'm trying to solve a riddle?
Wait.

Yeah.
No.

You are not permitted to be here!
Drax, who are you speaking to?
I am speaking to... myself.
We are running out of time.
Time!
Run to the symbol of time!
[BOTH GRUNT]
Whoo-hoo!
Why run when you can fly?
So this is why you have been winning, Drax.
You were cheating!
Technically, we were the ones cheating.
Oh, and you're welcome.
But you are not!
Not here, not now, not ever!
[GRUNTING]
[SPHINX] When is what weighs you down also what lifts you up?
"When is what weighs you down also what lifts you up?"
What a difficult riddle.

I could discuss it with.
Drax, can you hear me?

Drax!
[GRUNTS]
More cheating!
Have you not a shred of honor?

[BOTH GRUNT]
I am not cheating because I am not competing.
[BOTH STRAINING]
We are being punished for your weakness.
You call yourself the Destroyer, but what have you ever destroyed besides your own family?
You blame Thanos, you blame Ronan, but the fault is yours!
You are right.
I was not strong enough to protect them.
It is a shame I live with always.
I call myself Destroyer, hoping one day I will believe it.

[GRUNTS, YELLS]
Do not just stand there!

Yeah!

I understand the riddle now.
The friends and family which weigh us down also lift us up.
The temple wants us to work together.
[GRUNTS] Preposterous!
As I said, friends and allies are always beneficial.
False!

Is that... the beacon?
Ha!

[XERON] No!

Nobody panic.

We just need to soothe the savage beast with a little music.
♪ ...dream, and you're real ♪
♪ 'Cause my heart's beatin' through my chest ♪
♪ And... ♪ [ROARS]
[YELLS, GRUNTS]
Okay, everybody can panic now.
[ROARING] [ROCKET GRUNTS]
No...
[ROARS]
[GRUNTING, GROANING]
[DRAX] Xeron, attacking the Sphinx will only endanger my friends.
We must attempt to solve the riddle.
[YELLING]
All that matters is retrieving the beacon.
And I will use it to summon the Warlock and destroy him.
[GRUNTS]
[GROWLING]
[GRUNTS] I must help my friends.
But riddles and metaphors...
[GRUNTS] The brain of Drax does not work this way!
Yes!

[GRUNTS]
I cannot parse these words or their meanings.
Unless...

"The lyrics do not matter, so long as it swings."
[GRUNTS]
Prepare to swing, foul beast!
[YELLING] [GROWLING]
[GRUNTS]
You, too, Xeron!

[BOTH GRUNTING]
[ALL YELLING]
[GRUNTING, YELLING]
As I thought.
The temple does want us to work together.
[SPHINX GROWLING]
[GROANS] Oh, I feel like I'm gonna hurl from getting hurled!
At last!
The Warlock shall be summoned and destroyed.
[QUILL] We can't let you do that, Xeron.
Do you know the destruction the Warlock has wrought on my people throughout the ages?
This is my sacred duty.

I have met Adam Warlock.
He is an honorable, if naive soul.
You are on a first-name basis with our hated enemy?
Does your betrayal know no bounds?
[GRUNTS]
[WARLOCK GRUNTS] Guardians, what... what's happened?
It's all right, Adam.

[GRUNTS] I don't want to be here!
Quill, we have a problem.

That's never a good sign.
[YELLING]
Just look at him!

[CRYING OUT]
What do you expect?

He doesn't know how to control his powers.
He just needs to calm down.
Let me go!
[ECHOING]
[GUARDIANS GROANING]
[GROANS] Drax!
[COUGHING]
You must fulfill your destiny.
Atone for your past mistakes.
What did your family bring you in the end except loss?
Remember, the Destroyer walks alone!
[CRYING OUT]
[GRUNTING]
[GRUNTS]
Yes, my family brought me pain, but it is a pain I carry gladly.
And their memory makes me strong, not weak, as do my friends.

[GRUNTS]
[QUILL YELLING] Huh?
[GRUNTING] Huh?
Thank you, friend Drax.
I'm feeling much better now.
Why would the Warlock save my life after I tried to end his?
A riddle to ponder, perhaps.
Okay, how's about we save the hugs for when we get outta here?

[XERON] The entrance is still gone.
The Sphinx called it a test.

The question:

[TOGETHER] We are!
I owe you all an apology.
Whatever your Warlock once was, he clearly does not deserve to be destroyed.
BUT KNOW THIS: if the Warlock does become a threat to the galaxy,
I will not hesitate to fulfill my destiny.
I would expect no less, Xeron the Destroyer, as I must fulfill my own destiny to help the Guardians to rid the galaxy of a great evil.
So you heard about my dad then.
Farewell, friend Drax.
I confess, our experience has left me with many questions about the true purpose of the Destroyer.
Perhaps it is a metaphor.
Friends help us destroy weakness, destroy ignorance, so that we might be free to become our best selves.
After my experience, I thought I would try to better understand "metaphor" by writing a song of my own.
[monotone voice] ♪ When we met, I fell for you ♪
♪ Which is a lie because my balance is true ♪
♪ My love for you could fill the sea ♪
♪ But obviously not literally ♪
♪ Because love is an abstract notion ♪
♪ And has no substance with which to fill an ocean ♪
I am Groot!
Well, I don't think it literally emits a foul stench, but it kind of stinks.
Do not judge until you have heard the other 59 verses.
Must I remind you?

[angry groan]
I'll show ya swingin'!
