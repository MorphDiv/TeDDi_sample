(ICE CRACKLING)
Good evening.
We are here tonight to talk about violence.
Or maybe human nature.
(SIGHS)
We are here to talk about human nature.
Wait.
A quote.
A great philosopher once wrote, "In times of peace, the warlike man attacks himself."
This is the root of all our problems.
And by "this,"
I mean "we."
We are the root of all our problems... our confusion, our anger, our fear of things we don't understand.
Violence, in other words, is ignorance.
Figure your shit out.
That's my... what I'd say.

There are two kinds of stories we tell our children.
The first kind:
Once upon a time, there was a fuzzy little rabbit named Frizzy-Top who went on a quantum, fun adventure only to face a big setback, which he overcame through perseverance and by being adorable.
This kind of story teaches empathy.
Put yourself in Frizzy-Top's shoes, in other words.
The other kind:
Oliver Anthony Bird, if you get too close to that ocean, you'll be sucked into the sea and drowned!
This kind of story teaches them fear.
And for the rest of their lives, these two stories compete.
Empathy and fear.
And so I bring you tonight's play, a work in five acts about a fuzzy little bunny who got too close to the ocean and what happened next.
