Hey, gang.

Popcorn Chicken is back?

No, Popcorn Chicken is not back.
A TV crew is going to shoot an infomercial at Cattleman's Ranch!
Whoa, cool!
An infomercial?

It's like a commercial, but longer.
And they come on late at night.
I watch them when I can't sleep because of Grandma's snoring through the wall.
_
_
How are you gonna serve food if there's a bunch of TV people running around the restaurant?
We're closing the restaurant for the day.
They're paying us a generous location fee.
They're paying you to not serve food?
I love it.

Some of those infomercials are so cool.
Dad, would it be okay if I went down to the restaurant to watch?
Hmm.

I'll see if I can pull some strings.
Oh, um, I'm actually busy.
That's okay.

Oh, okay.

This will only make me stronger!
Where is my papaya?
Excuse me?
My papaya.

My morning papaya is my one moment of joy, the thing that gets me ready for the day, and someone ate my papaya.
Oh!

I knew it!

Turn the other cheek.
No, the other thing about Bible justice?
- An eye for an eye?

Hey, that's the last of the Lucky Charms!
You eat my papaya, I eat your cereal.
Purple horseshoe?
Is this some kind of a political thing?

[Sighs] Bananas.

Can't a brother get a red shell?
Eddie, you're not gonna believe it.
Don't distract me.

There's no guardrails.
Eddie, put the joystick down.
[Video game beeps]
I just had lunch at my white friend Zack's house, and I saw something.
Delicious lunch, Mr. and Mrs. Z.
Can I help with the dishes?
You relax.

[Beeps, dishwasher whirring]
I don't get it.
Why would she put dirty plates in the drying rack?
That's just it, Eddie.

It's a dishwasher.
You mean the thing we put our dishes in after we wash them in the sink?
The drying rack.
Darn it, Edwyn!

It's a machine that washes the dishes for you.
With jets of water that shoot on the plates.
I'm sorry.

The one at Zack's house looks just like it.
Only it had buttons.
Is that tape?
[Gasps] The controls!
Super Rinse, Heavy Duty.
Pots and Pans?
What are you boys doing?
We've had a dishwasher this whole time?
Why haven't we been using it?
Because this family doesn't believe in dishwashers.
It was there when we moved in.

Why not?

It makes you soft, and it's hard on the dishware.
Chinese people respect their nice plates.
That's why they're called "China."
But...

Wash and dry dishes the usual way.
Ooh!

What a gentle beast.
Oh.
[Chuckles] Emery:

This is amazing.
Ah, Louis.

This is my son Emery.

Hi, Emery.

It's so glamorous.

Uh, lights.
[Sighs] Lights.
Okay, settle down. [Chuckles]
Oh. "The On-Gun"?
It's "The Un-Gun." It's a Salad Shooter for onions.
Oh.

Hey, mister, wh-where were you during our three-day creative retreat, huh?
[Laughs] It took you three days to come up with On-Gun?
A lot of it was, uh, you know, like, volleyball.
Oh.

[New Zealand accent] Hello, hello, hello!
Oh.

Oh, "proprietor." I like that.

[Chuckles] Hi, I'm Louis...
[New Zealand accent] "Proprietor."
Tony Wonder at your service.
Oh!

My favorite is the Dyna-Broom.
Always nice to meet a fan.
[Normal voice] Oh.
"Keep it squiggy.

Oh, thank you!
I guess I'll just hold onto this.
Bad news, boss.

What?

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

What are we gonna do?

We need somebody to eat the salad and then...

I have an idea.
Why doesn't Louis play our Salad Eater?
- Really, me?

Reggie:

No.

Yeah.

Yeah!

Yeah, yeah.

Huzzah!

Oh, no.

"Welcome to the cast, Louie baby."
[Chuckles] Well, thank you.
Now we don't have to fight over just the one.
Let's go.

[Music stops, door opens]
Eddie, I specifically told you not to use the dishwasher.
- I didn't!

It's Florida.

[Huffs]
Okay.

I wash dishes by hand, the stupid way.
Let me see your hands.
If your fingers look like raisins,
I'll know you're telling the truth.
They were wrinkly before, but they plumped already.
I know what's going on here...

Profiled?
Every time something bad happens, you assume I'm the one who did it.
I'm a victim of institutional bias.
What?

Oh, I can't know things?

No allowance, three weeks.
I'm not paying you to do chores that a machine is doing for you.
But I was saving up to buy an N64 and play "GoldenEye" the day it comes out.
Oddjob's gonna bust a cap in some fools.
Hearing what you want to do with that money only makes me know I'm doing the right thing.
You're stressing me out.

[Sighs]
[Spritzing]
Okay, Louis, are you ready to eat some salad?
Call me the Titanic, 'cause I'm about to tear into some iceberg.
Great.
So, for this first shot, Tony's gonna demonstrate the Un-Gun.
And then he'll ask, "And how does it work on those salads?"
At which point, we will pan over to you, and you're gonna say your line, which is,
"Onions, shallots, scallions...

And then you eat some salad.
Got it. [Chuckles]
Hey, um, that thing I said about the Titanic earlier,
I didn't mean to offend anyone.
That was a huge tragedy.
All right.

Hi, Dad.

Uhp.

Wishing someone good luck is actually bad luck.
- Good to know.

I'm surprised how calm you are.
If I were in your shoes, I'd be so nervous.
Nervous?

This infomercial is gonna be seen by hundreds of people, every one of them dissecting your performance, wondering, "Why this guy?
Why does he get to be the Salad Eater?"
It's like they're setting you up for failure.
Okay.

Reggie:

Man:

Reggie:

The Un-Gun.
It's so easy, the only thing you'll be crying about is not getting one sooner.
[Laughs] [Motor whirs]
And how does it work on that salad?
Onions, shallions, scallots...

Okay, cut. [Bell rings]
[Chuckles] How was that?
Uh, you just mixed up some of the words.
The line is, "Onions, shallots, scallions...

What did I say?
You said something different, but it doesn't matter.
Let's do it again.

Man:

And... action!
And how does it work on that salad?
Onions, shillions, skillets...

Cut.
Onions, shallots, sicillians...

Okay, cut.
Onions, garlic, galleons...

Onions, onions, onions...
And cut.

Louis.

Onions, scallions, shallots.

[Laughs] "It do."
[Muffled] Onions, scallions, shallots...

Oh!

Onions, shallions...

Onions, shal...

Oh, I got dressing on my sleeve.
Onions, shallots, scallions.
Line?
Cut.
Forget it.

[Sighs]
[Whispers] Good tea.
Why are you whispering?
I'm saving my voice for the infomercial tomorrow.
You're not done yet?

[Normal voice] I had a little trouble getting the line.
But they said it was no big deal.
We just have to shoot again tomorrow.
Which means an extra day of location fees.
You okay?

I'm just worried about Eddie.
What's wrong?
Today I told him not to use the dishwasher, and he did it anyway.
We have a dishwasher?
Then he has the nerve to look me in the eye and lie about it.
Hmm.

Are we raising a bad kid?
[Sighs] No way.

He's probably just excited to try out the machine, which apparently we have.
You're probably right.
Don't worry.

[Grandma Huang snoring]
[Whispering] Could you yell at my mom to turn on her side?
I'd do it, but... my instrument.
That dishwasher should never have been connected in the first place.
Who knows how much water has been wasted dripping into those hoses?
It must have cost us a fortune in drips.
You know who's a drip?

It's like, "Put on some pants."
There.

Thank you.

[Telephone rings]
Hello?
What?

Where's the manager?
[Door opens]
Where is he?

Who?
My son!

Uh, that... that wasn't me.
Isn't this Razorshank Records?
It is.
We have another location in the mall.
[Sighs]
You need to be clearer on the phone.
And you are in big trouble.
[Telephone rings]
Razorshank Records...
Mall location.
And that's when I found this CD tucked into his waistband.
Eddie, what were you thinking?
I know what he wasn't thinking...
All stolen merchandise comes out of Howie's paycheck.
But you know who does think about that?
Howie.

I'm Howie, if that wasn't clear.
I swear, I didn't steal that CD!
I brought it from home.
This place buys used CDs, and since you took away my allowance,
I was gonna sell my old "Street Fighter" soundtrack
- for some extra skrill.

If you weren't stealing, then why was this tucked into your waistband?
Because my pockets were full of Runts candy.
Okay.

That's what they're for.

You even ate the bananas?

Howie, I am so sorry about all of this.
He's gonna be in big trouble when he gets home.
Oh, he's going to jail.
What?
It's corporate policy to prosecute shoplifters to the fullest extent of the law.
Corporate policy?
Your logo is a man slapping a cop!
Maybe there's a bee on his face.
We see what we want to see.
Red leather, yellow leather.
La, la, la, la, la, la.

Emery, I've been practicing all morning and I think I finally got it.
Onions, shallots, scallions...

Yeah, about that.

They want someone else to play the Salad Eater.
What?

Emery, we're ready for you.
You're the new Salad Eater?
I happened to be walking by and heard them saying they were gonna recast you.
Then the director looked at me through his fingers, and next thing I knew, I had the part.
That doesn't even make sense.

Not Danny Winterbottom.
Who's Danny Winterbottom?
My character.
He loves salad because he was raised on a lettuce farm.
Growing up, his mom would give him salad as a treat.
Oh, I see what's going on here.
Making me nervous about being on TV, wishing me luck.
You were sabotaging me from the start.
I don't feel bad.
When I found out what the lights were,
I knew I wanted to be in front of them.
Sorry, Dad.

Sorry how this all went down.
Please accept this consolation bobblehead.
We're both sorry.

Yeah.
Do you really think if I were to steal a CD, it would be the "Street Fighter" soundtrack?
"Makaveli" just came out.
"Life After Death" just came out.
Why would I shoplift a two-year-old soundtrack from a movie about a video game?
You'd be amazed at what people try to steal.
Last week, my mom made us snickerdoodles to celebrate the end of Lent.
Gone.
Boss, the new Spice Girls CD isn't ringing up.
The line out front has gone from Baby to Scary.
Excuse me.

Don't go anywhere.
I can't believe you stole.
- I told you, I'm not a thief.

But after what happened with the dishwasher, how can I believe you?
[Sighs]
All right.

Aha!
And I did lie about it, but I didn't steal the CD.
That's the truth.
I knew it.

Oh, I didn't eat your papaya.

Those slimy black seeds?

Well, if you didn't eat my papaya, who did?
I don't want to say.
Eddie, tell me!
I can't.

Howie, put him in jail!
Fine.
It was Evan.
Evan?

It wasn't his fault.
He didn't mean to eat your breakfast.
He just has a weakness for tropical fruit.
He also has a clean record, so I took the fall for him.
I mean, what's another papaya on my rap sheet?
You mean you sat and watched me eat your Irish elf cereal just so your little brother wouldn't get into trouble?
Yeah.

Uh, Mom, are you okay?
[Chuckles]
I'm proud of you, Eddie.
Really?

No, I'm not mad.
So, you're saying sometimes it's good to lie?
No.

You lied about us having a dishwasher.
Isn't that hypocritical?
Eddie, there is something called a "white lie."
And that is a lie that protects you from all the things that make white people soft.
Emery, you were here yesterday, so you know what we're going for.
Yep.

Okay.

An Asian boy named Winterbottom.

And... action!
The Un-Gun is so easy to use, the only thing you'll be crying about is not getting one sooner.
[Motor whirs]
And how does it work on that salad?
Onions, shallots, scallions...

Yeah, great, but can you do it without all the blinking?
What blinking?
Cut. [Bell rings]
Dustin, could you get me a hot tea and six cyanide capsules?
Uh, let me talk to him.
Dad, did you see the blinking they were talking about?
Do you think the camera's picking it up?
Yeah, I do.
I guess I'm more nervous than I thought I'd be.
It's okay.

Yes, I was a little upset when I heard about the recast, but if it can't be me, I'm happy it's you.
Salad Eater is the second role you were born to play.
What was the first?
Fantastic son.
Thanks, Dad.
I understand now.
You're trying to throw me off my game, make me think my mediocre performance is fine so I don't strive to be the best.
Well, it's not going to work.
What?

Get out of my eyeline.
Let's shoot this thing!
[Sighs]
Well, that Spice Girls line was a total nightmare.
A lot more middle-aged men than I thought. [Chuckles]
Where were we?

I was just about to press charges against your boy.
You will do no such thing.
I believe my son.

Well, that's nice you believe him, but there's still no way of knowing whether the CD is really his or if he stole it.
I'm gonna call the police.
16 seconds!

That's the exact moment it skips on track 8.
I know that because it's my CD.
What have we here?

Play it.
I have to fast-forward a bit.
Hold down the right arrow button.
Hold it down.
I'm doing it.

"My mistake"?

You falsely accused my son of being a thief!
You need to make this right.
How would I do that?
You're gonna buy back his music disc at full price.
Or else I will tell everyone that your store profiles Asians.
Institutional bias.
But it's a "Street Fighter" soundtrack from two years ago, a-and it skips.
No one's gonna buy it.
Eddie, what's that sound like to you?
Not our problem.
Fine.
Who pays for it?
Howie does.

They said the infomercial will air sometime between 3:00 and 6:00 a.m.
Mom, will you pass the popcorn?
You're hungry?

I said I was sorry.

I can't believe you're gonna be on TV, Emery.
Thanks, Eddie.

[Sighs] I told you, I wasn't trying to sabotage you.
Hmm.

Are you a dumb idiot, wasting everyone's time and money, cutting onions the old-fashioned way?
Uh, duh.
