Okay, boys.

Rapunzel:

I mean, maybe we could remodel it or something, you know, make it warm and welcoming.
That archway is an important line of defense, Rapunzel.
It is imperative it convey strength and security.
You want strength and security, here's what you do...
Lion statues!

No, wait!

Thank you, Eugene.

Ahh, teamwork!

Your Majesty!
Right!

We're eating.
Next time, then.

You know, Blondie, you might wanna start coming up with lion designs for that archway.

I'm sure the king loved your idea.
You do realize he was just being polite, and probably didn't wanna call you a nitwit to your face.
Cass!

Yeah.

Well, before you go and have your royal advisor nameplate made up, you should probably know that whenever the king wants to ignore an idea, he always says, "I'll take it under advisement."
Ha!

Take those suggestions under advisement.
- Oh, no!

This changes everything!

Why not?

That's not true, Eugene.

Though, maybe there are times you could be a bit more selective about the kinds of things you suggest to him.
He is the king, after all.
Et tu, Blondie?
Okay, you know what?

Quick!

The emergency alarm!
Equis?

Mm-hm.
What's that got to do with my dad's statue?
Why is it all messed up?
Your dad's lifetime rival, King Trevor of Equis, likes to play pranks on him.
By just drawing a silly face on Dad's statue?
I can't imagine any intelligent person finding this funny.
Anyway, King Trevor always manages to thoroughly embarrass your father.
I can hear you, Captain.

Embarrassed for him!

- I still don't get it.

Trevor has been trying to lure me into partaking in his shenanigans since our youth.
Well, I won't partake!
Do you hear me, Trevor?
I won't partake!
I must partake!

Ooh, I need a prank!
I must show the people that, despite that sign's proclamations,
Equis does not rule!
I agree, but how?
Yes, how?
By striking against that which he holds most dear!
The very symbol of his land!
You mean, the Seal of Equis?
But, Your Majesty, the castle of Equis is impenetrable.
In fact, only one man has ever successfully infiltrated its defenses.
And he...
You guys talkin' about me?
Blondie, great news!
Your dad just asked me to steal the Royal Seal of Equis for him!
Stealing from Equis?
That doesn't sound like a great idea.
Did you know that they have over a thousand guards on duty at any given time?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, but don't you see?
It's the perfect way for me to prove to him I'm more than just some nitwit thief!
By stealing something?
No.
By stealing something well.
- Hm.

I'm pretty sure that makes it completely legal... ish.
Oh!

I'm pretty good at surprises.
Sorry, Blondie, but I've assessed the situation, and this is a one-man job.
Luckily, Flynn Rider does his best work alone.
Let's go, partner!
Wait!

Of course I'm coming with you.

Though this new, dashing adventure suit I had made is quite slimming.
I must witness Trevor's humiliation first hand!
Ohh... yeah.
See, um, ha-ha.
The thing is, I was thinking you wanted, you know, me to do it alone.
Uh, not that I wouldn't love to have you along.
It's just, you probably have way more important...
This is a matter of national pride, son.
Of course it's important.

- of Equis, remember?

I thought you were using the royal "we," you know, being king?
Come on, let's do this!
How'd you put it before?

Yeah.

Okie-dokie, never mind.
So, Your Majesty, I've drawn up this map based upon the brilliant way I got into Castle Equis before, to show you how this is gonna go down.
All we need to do is borrow a couple of uniforms and waltz right through the front door.
- Eh?

- We're not?

I've received top military training.
After studying this map, I can say with certainty that what is required here is stealthy ingress.
And this is the perfect spot to do it!
The northeast tower?
The heavily guarded, impossibly fortified northeast tower?
No one will expect it.
Mmph, what's so fun about pranks, anyway?
Mostly, the look on the other person's face when they realize what's happening.
So, it's supposed to surprise people?
Well, it's more like a joke.
But, only the person responsible for it thinks it's funny.
Oh.

No-oo.

You need to get somebody to expect one thing and then do something unexpected instead.
It's basically entertainment for morons.
Hmmm.
Unexpected, eh?
By the time he wakes up, he'll be so well rested he won't even know what hit him!
I can't wait to see the look on his face.
Unexpected, but not clever.
All is clear.
Just follow my lead.
Your highness.
Ohh, whew.
Huh?
Hmm.
Aah!
Ah-huh-huh.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, boy.
Huh!
Get over...!
fellow guards.
Yes!
There.

Eugene, I thought I said the guard uniforms were unnecessary.
Come on!

Oh, yeah, no, don't mind me.
I'm just gonna scream into this for a little bit.
- Ooh!

Okay.

Really?
- What was that?

This way!
They didn't spot me.

Let's move out!
Ahhh!

All I'm saying is, if you bring a quiche to work, you should bring enough to share with your co-workers.
- That's...

Yeah, but that's...

- don't tell me what I don't like.

Okay, because I...

- but you never point that out.

You just tell me all the stuff I don't like.
- Yeah.

Okay, you start cleaning the spears, I'll work on the swords.
Ha!

Ha!

You should see the look on your face!
You've just been pranked!
Or as it's soon to be called, Rapunzelled.
That was clever.
But not funny.
Ahhh.

How do you like that, Eugene?
- Told ya!

Flawless plan.
Ahhh.

Oh-ho-ho, sweet revenge!
- It's a seal.

- It's a seal seal!

It is a seal seal owned by a king!
Thus, a royal seal.
- Hmm?

Y...

At this point, never mind!
Just grab your end and let's get outta here.
Yoo-ahh!
- What?

Leaving a calling card, so Trevor knows it was I who did this.
What should I paint, hm?
Eye patch?

Perhaps a tear, representing his imminent humiliation at being bested by me.
No!

Let us go now!
Oh, I'm gonna need your grappling hook.
You're the expert.

Oh, oh, so when you say "we," do you still mean the royal "we,"
which is actually you telling me how to fix this?
Well, no.

Eugene:

I asked you to come so that "we" could get the seal.
Okay, okay, now I'm confused.

Not to mention the fact that I couldn't get the proper definition of seal from you!
Huh?

Uh, hey, guys.
Hey, you guys.

Repairing in the middle of the night?
'Cause this thing is broken.
Well, this prank has gone horribly awry.
Listen, I'm sorry I lost my cool.
It's just, this whole prank was my big chance to get you to take me seriously.
Take you seriously?
Yeah.

I know.

You know, there are many things I fail to take seriously.
Eugene... son, you brought my daughter home to me after 18 long years.
If there's one man in the whole world I take very seriously, it's you.
Wow.

Can I ask then, why... why didn't you listen to my ideas?
You know, I suppose sometimes I let good ones slip through the cracks.
I should've given your plan more consideration.
What you should have done was stayed in your own kingdom, Frederic!
Trevor.
Your efforts to abscond with my sweet Trevor Jr. were comical at best.
Oh.

Of course he's not!

All right, Trevor.

Now, release us.
Oh, I'll let you go, but not until I parade you through town in nothing but a jester's hat, proving once again that Equis is superior to Corona!
For now, I leave you here to wallow in the stench of your own defeat.
Trevor's right.
Oh, come on, you don't smell that bad.
Plus, it's mostly seal.
I meant, I deserve to wear nothing but a jester's hat.
Uh, Your Majesty?

Once again, he showed himself to be the more accomplished prankster.
Accomplished?

I mean, I laughed, a little.

Yes, that's true.

Totally grating.

- That's it!

I'm gettin' us outta here.
The question is, are you willing to try it my way?
Ha!

Did you see the look on his face?
He expected one apple, but then he got a whole bunch!
Best.

Funny.

Eugene:

There's no way you'll escape that way!
Hey!

Fellas!

The king, he escaped without me.
I don't know if I'm more impressed or insulted.

Open the door!
Oh, no, King Trevor's gonna have our necks for this.
Lose something?
Quickly, if we go back the way we came, he might not see us.
Wait.
Follow my lead.
Well, well.
It appears someone hasn't learned their lesson yet.
Okay, okay, look, you got us.
This one is completely our fault.
Ooh!

Uh, really?

Well, I thought it'd be funny to slip into the library and rearrange the periodicals.
Historians hate that.
That is the worst idea for a prank I have ever heard!
And in true Coronan fashion, you would've failed!

That's the real door to the library!
Uh, no, nope.

I'm pretty sure this is the library.
You imbecile!

I know where my library is!
Meh!

I'll prove it.
You see...
Forgot about your own top-notch security for a second, didn't ya?
Well played, Eugene!
Very well played!
Up high.
Yeah!
Trevor:

Spiders!

Trevor:

Those had better be claps of sorrow!
Would you look at that.
I've finally humiliated Trevor!
Oh, Your Majesty!
We have not yet begun to humiliate that guy.
Ahhh.
Both:

Eugene:

Gotcha, Dad!
Oh, man, you should see the look on your face right now.
Well, I suppose it's fine.

- By nightfall.

Of course, Your Majesty.
Well, Raps, you finally figured out this whole prank thing.
Yes!
It was unexpected, clever, funny and mischievous, but you overlooked one of the most important parts of any good prank.
You didn't think it through.
We both still have to repaint the archway by nightfall.
Remember?
Sorry, but I've got princess duties to attend to.
Looks like you're gonna have to do it all by yourself.
Still believe I didn't think it through?
Kidding!
You just got pranked!
I totally got you!
You should've seen the look on your face!
I just got Rapunzelled.
Well played, Raps.
Very well played.
Well, Your Majesty, did you do it?

Unfortunately, no, Captain.
However, Eugene came up with something far better.
Curse you, Frederic!
Frederic, curse you!
