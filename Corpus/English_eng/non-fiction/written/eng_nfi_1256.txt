We have a leukemia patient who's having trouble finding a genetic match.

She needs you.
I don't want us to be "Mom" and "Matt" to Louie.
I want us to be "Mom" and "Dad."
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
[Cheering]
- Hey, who the hell are you?

And I want him back.
The paperwork on Louie said there was no known father.
So where did this Andre Keyes come from?
I don't know any more than you do.
He must've gone through outside channels to track you down.
Isn't all that information confidential?
Yes.

Well, that's a pretty serious breach.
I doubt it had anything to do with DCFS.
DCFS's job is to protect these kids.
After everything Louie's been put through we're just... baby.
Tina...
We need your help, okay?
The whole thing seems pretty shady.
What kind of person waits three years to contact his child?
We'll reach out to him right away.
Try to get to the bottom of this.
In the meantime, let's keep our heads.
For Louie's sake.
You're a match.
- Seriously?

That's amazing.
You don't even know the half of it.
We've been looking for a suitable donor for Anna for a very long time.
I mean, not even her brother and sister are a match.
That's great.

We haven't told her yet.
We won't tell her until you sign the intent to donate.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

Slow down.

Harvesting bone marrow is a painful process and there are some small, but very real risks...
Clarke, where do I sign?
Buddy, you're gonna be in pain for a while.
- You might miss a few shifts.

I got a ton of furlough coming my way.
All right, but when you say you're doing this, we start Anna on a brutal course of radiation and chemo.
We have to kill off her dead cells to clear the way for your healthy ones.
Basically, we're gonna destroy her immune system.
So if you back out...

Clarke...

Maybe he just wants to shake us down.
Well, then he's messing with the wrong girl.
No kidding.
Look, it's gonna be okay, Gabby.
I mean, DCFS will read this guy the riot act.
Oh, what the hell?

Why would someone take it?

Because it's the best piece.
And it's the shiniest.
There's nothing shiny in that box.
It's been here since '78.
Yeah, just like every other game in this place.
We've played 'em all a billion times.

Well, the net's a little ratty.
What, are you kidding?

Am I the only one who remembers the foosball fiasco of 2009?
Yeah, I said the same thing, Chief, but then I figured it'd be a nice distraction.
Good way to blow off a little steam...

Yes!

Judge Paget says to get you're one of the bests.
Adoption attorneys in the city.
That's nice to hear, but I hope he warned you,
- I'm a straight shooter.

We just need to know what we're dealing with.
In cases like these, the birth parent almost always wins guardianship.
Well, what if...

I mean, he's basically been stalking us.
I understand, but the courts are generally reluctant to award custody to someone other than the natural parents, except in cases where those parents clearly abused, neglected, or abandoned them.
Andre Keyes abandoned Louie for the last three years.
Louie was bounced from one abusive home to another his entire life.
We're not just gonna hand him over.
I understand how upsetting this is...
For both of you, but I think it's important for you to know you are not legally a guardian of Louie's, since only Ms. Dawson's name appears on the foster application.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

- together...

Fact is, you're still facing long odds.
Knowing all that, you need to think hard about whether or not you're going to pursue permanent guardianship of Louie.

Been deployed in that region on and off for the last three years.

Had a baby.

Uh...

No.
She's still in and out of rehab.
Told me she couldn't take care of the baby then, still can't, but she asked me for money.
