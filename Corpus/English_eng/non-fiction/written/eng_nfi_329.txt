*JUSTICE LEAGUE ACTION* Season 01 Episode 27 Aired on: 8th July 2017.
♪♪ Title: "Time Out"
Free will is a disease.
New social behavior is the only true hierarchy.
Submit to cooperation.

Do you remember when we fought villains who weren't weird?
No.
Give it up, H.I.V.E. Master.
We're shutting this operation down.
Haven't you ever seen a colony defend itself, Wonder Whelp?
Booster, the device!
No worries, Bats.

Huh?
No!
Not so fast, boys.
Whoo!

- What was that?

So now it's my fault I got barbecued?
It's never your fault.

Or when you got Guy Gardner stuck in the space elevator.
Okay.

This isn't a game.
People could have gotten hurt.
Fine, I messed up.

Not once.

It's a pattern of behavior.

You're unprofessional, unfocused.
Sorry, what?

Hashtag, "Bat time".
Bats, come on.

Booster!

- Ouch.

- What happened?

It's called a time fissure.
A disruption in the normal flow of time.
Why aren't we frozen?
I have a 10-foot temporal bubble around me at all times.
You must have been inside it when the causality broke.
Man, I wonder if now's a good time to get that 10-spot she owes me?
The fire hydrant!
Excuse me.
During the fight, I saw a fire hydrant vanish.
Deleted objects are often a sign of the time stream trying to repair damage.
Should I be worried?
Normally, no...
But this doesn't seem like a normal time fissure.
The epicenter's too big.
Are those normal?
Run!

- What are these things?

Think of them like time's immune system.
They can't tell the difference between us and whatever's causing this.
Hello!

So, we have to stay within 10 feet of each other?
Only if you want to help me solve this.
Otherwise, you'll have to rubber-band back to the moment just before your fissure and you won't remember being here.
Through here!
Oh, ho-ho, easy.
Chronal nausea.

Hey, look to your right.
Where are we?
Somewhere safe, my headquarters.
A citadel overlooking both time and space.
I calls it...
The Booster Cave.
The Hall of Booster?
Boost Tower!
The Boosty-ay-hizza!
The Secret Boost Sanctuary.
All right, fine.

You built all this yourself?
Sure, protecting time is sort of a hobby with me.
I find time between missions, put in a little monitor duty, fix what needs fixing, you know.
Ah.

A Chronovore.

It stores it all in a crystal located inside of its belly.
Whoa.
Never seen one this big.
How long have you been doing this?
Whenever I'm not around.
I just assumed you were off playing foosball somewhere.
Oh, I totally do that too.
First to three?
No, you know what?

What now?
Simple.

Just one problem.

Unless you want to age 100 years in a few seconds.
Here.

Thanks.
Ain't nothing but a thing.
Where are we now?
According to the time sphere, right before our battle with H.I.V.E.
Whoa!
- What are you doing?

Bats, I'm totally bored.
Where are these weirdos supposed to be, anyway?
Close.
Word on the street is,
H.I.V.E. is recruiting out of a youth center in the area.
Hey, you ever tried touching your nose with your tongue?
Do you remember seeing our future selves in the bushes six hours ago?
No?

Why didn't you tell anyone this is how you spend your time?
I guess I never saw the big deal.
It's like...

So you need a rat guy, right?
But nobody ever sets out to be the rat guy.
But somebody's got to do it.

I'm time's rat guy.
For the last time, be quiet or leave!
Man!

Get down!
Right on time.

Ten seconds.

More than enough.
Okay, ugly, let's dance.
You're a big girl, aren't ya?
Batman, a little...

- Hey, thanks.

I'm open to suggestions.
Ah!

Me?

Actually, in case you haven't noticed,
I'm a little out of my depth here.
You're the expert.
We've been fighting like two separate entities, but we're at a disadvantage.

Get in close, back to back.

- Right.

It's okay.

Yes!
It's not enough.

I don't accept that.
You said you've beaten creatures like this before?
Yeah, but never this big.
Still, you fought them.
What's different this time?

There's two of us.

I'm only half as effective.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry, Bats.

Just trust me.
Booster, do that, and I'll be returned to just before we left.
I won't remember any of this.
That's okay, Bats.

I was wrong about you.
You're a better person than anybody gives you credit for.
Maybe one day, I'll find that out.
Round two.
Not once.

It's a pattern of behavior.

You're unprofessional, unfocused.
Booster!

You know what?
Nothing.

You're right, Bats.

Sure you weren't too hard on him?
No.

Hah!

Better times.
