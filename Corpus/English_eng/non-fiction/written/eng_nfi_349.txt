No, no, you keep your goddamn head down, all right?
You hear me?
Take out that gunner!
Stay here, you don't move a goddamn muscle!
Bill.
Bill, please, please, don't leave.
Please don't leave, I don't wanna die.
Goddammit, kid.
No, bill, please.
Bill, please.
Please.
Bill.
Bill, bill, don't leave!
Wake up, bill.
Come on, wake up!
Please, don't shoot him, Luther.
Nobody's gonna shoot nobody.
We're just here to take bill to jail.
Jail?
Now, hold on a minute, I ain't done nothin'.
You sell the horse and the carriage to Sam here?
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little commerce, is there?
But did you own that horse and carriage?
I would if I had any kinda luck.
Get up and get dressed.
And don't try nothin', 'cause I got your gun.
Can I leave?
Let her go.
She's a fine woman, highly talented.
You may quote me, my dear.
Thank you.
I'll come visit ya, bill.
Go.
Shit!
I need hardly remind you that I never miss.
Your gun, please, and mine.
You think you're gonna get away with this, bill?
Sam, open the closet.
Get inside.
Oh, but, bill,
I'm not really good in confined spaces.
Sam!
Closet or the bullet, come on.
You, too, sheriff.
Sorry.
I am not gonna forget this.
I'm sure you won't.
Get inside.
I'm comin' for ya, Billy.
Everyone, please, if you're boarding the train, you must have a ticket.
I'm gonna need to see a ticket, ma'am.
Sir!
I'm sorry, your ticket, or your money to buy one, or your life.
Hickok?
Do I know you?
Corporal Fred Finley.
You know, Reb uniforms, behind Reb lines?
Yeah, yeah, of course, of course.
Move out the way, please.
Sir, excuse me.
Forgive me, I'm, I'm desperate.
Tickets, please, what's goin' on here?
It seems my friend here has misplaced his wallet.
Yeah, lose it all the time.
Well, I'm still gonna need a ticket, sir.
Don't worry, I'll take care of his ticket.
A whiskey salesman, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Bourbon, rye, Brandy, through the whole Midwest clear to Omaha.
Suits you down to a T,
Ted.
You don't remember me, do ya?
What?
Don't remember my favorite corporal?
You remember Mattie, my cousin?
Well.
I introduced you to her.
Mattie, god.
Fred Finley.
Bill Hickok.
Whiskey.
Be two bits.
Okay.
You ever had Kentucky bourbon?
Sir.
Name's Phil Poe, proprietor of this establishment.
Bill, bill Hickok.
Wild bill Hickok?
Been known to go by that name.
Ben, get Mr. Hickok a bottle of my private stock.
Could I interest you in a game?
Much obliged, but I... ah, no buts, no buts.
Well, I can resist anything but temptation.
Well, we want you to feel at home, Mr. Hickok.
Enjoy your bourbon.
And the game.
Appreciate it.
Yeah.
So that's the famous wild bill?
Ah, hell, he don't look like he got a pot to piss in.
Gentlemen, I seem to have misplaced my wallet, so, if it's all the same to you, then, uh, my marker is my word of honor.
House rules.
You callin'?
I'm raising.
20 more.
Wait, hold on, you're a goddamn cheater.
You've been winning' every hand all night long.
Now, hold on, son.
This happens in poker.
Even a blind hog finds an acorn once in awhile.
Oh, yeah?
Who the hell are you?
Now, there's no need for that.
Put the gun down.
You just, you have a lot to learn about poker.
I'd be happy to teach you.
No, no, no, don't shoot him, Sam, he's just a boy.
Idiots.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What?
Which one's your horse?
Uh, that one.
Much obliged.
Closer to the fire, so I can see you, please.
What do you want, old man?
You can start by puttin' that gun away.
Name is George Knox, mayor of that town.
I figured maybe we could just go somewhere and talk for a while.
It used to be quiet here.
A place where people could raise their youngins without the fear of a stray bullet.
Things ain't so quiet anymore.
Now, we could use someone with your skills to help us get this town back to that place.
How would you like to be marshal of Abilene?
Why the hell would I wanna do a crazy thing like that?
The same reason you just interfered in another man's quarrel and put yourself between him and a bullet.
'Cause sometimes it takes a good man to stop bad people.
I ain't a good man.
Son, every man's got his demons.
How much does the job pay?
A $100 a month.
That's not nearly enough.
150 and $10 extra for every man you arrest.
What about each man I shoot?
It ain't blood money.
$10 for every man you arrest, not kill.
Now, we got a deal?
Deal.
If you don't mind me asking, what happened to your last marshal?
Resigned.
You mean he was killed?
Well, that's gonna cost you a little extra.
Say, a house and some new clothes?
I think we can handle that.
Marshal, all right.
Now, you fine gentlemen let me know if y'all need anything else, okay?
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
Mm-hmm.
Gentlemen, within a week, Abilene will be an island in the sea of Texas cattle and Texas humans.
Will all due respect, mayor, this is a good Christian town, a god-fearin' town.
Oh, for god's sakes, get off your high horse, Jenkins.
You and I both know that Abilene can teach Sodom and Gomorrah a few lessons.
But, Knox, hiring' a gunslinger, you think that's the right move?
Damn right it is.
Ooo-whee!
You sure are pretty.
Damned if I ain't.
You know, I can't seem to figure out how I ended up in here, and you ended up out there.
Didn't you steal my horse?
Son, I'm gonna give you a word of advice.
You're sittin' at the poker table, and you can't see who the idiot is, it's you.
I saved your life by throwing' you in that box.
You should be thankful.
Yeah, uh, just what did ya hit me with, anyway?
Big ol' bottle.
Scotch.
Damn shame.
Bang, got you!
What the hell are you doin'?
You following' me around with this?
I wanna be a lawman when I grow up!
A lawman, huh?
Why aren't you in school?
Don't you know nothin'?
It's Saturday.
Saturday?
Well, go on, get outta here.
I want my gun!
No, I'm keepin' your gun, I like it.
I said I want my gun, you bastard!
Hold up your hands, you son of a bitch!
I saw what you did to that poor boy.
You've run through your luck.
Every breath you take from now on is a personal present from me.
You wouldn't murder a man without givin' him a fair play, would you?
I'm gonna learn ya a lesson.
Can ya dance?
You look awful pretty in that getup.
Listen, why don't ya calm down and I'll give you my guns?
Yeah.
You like the sound of that?
Yeah.
Here.
Son of a bitch.
Somebody give me a hand here.
Yeah, I'll take charge here.
Mr. preacher.
In addition to my holy duties,
I'm also the town undertaker.
Well, that's handy, I guess.
We are a god-fearin' town, marshal.
It's like the good book says, waste not, want not.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Hoist him up.
He's all yours.
The good book also tells us that all things come to those who wait.
You better be careful shooting' people, Mr. marshal.
Sullivan's a good customer.
Your good customer just tried to bushwhack me.
Sully's harmless.
No one's harmless with a gun and a belly full of liquor.
From now on, you be sure you don't serve a man more than he can handle.
I just take orders, mister.
Mr. Poe says the only question I ask is, can they pay for their drinks?
Welcome.
I reckon congratulations are in order.
Ben, pour our new marshal a drink of the good stuff.
It's all right, Ben.
We'll drink this bottle.
Ah, no, no.

Whiskey's whiskey, ain't it?
Well, I prefer my own brand.
This is your brand.
These are all your brands.
Unless you're puttin' bad whiskey into good bottles.
Hmm?
How much you make a month, marshal, 150?
That ain't very much.
Things are gonna change around here.
First thing that's gonna change is this whiskey.
I have a duty to the citizens in this town.
Would $50 a month change your mind?
You know, the second thing that's gonna change, these cards.
I had a sneaking suspicion that people ain't been gettin' a square deal.
You're a good man, bill.
I spotted that right off.
What do ya say a $100 a month?
What kind of a marshal would I be if I didn't follow the letter of the law?
I reckon 25% of the house sounds about right, don't it?
This offer is nonnegotiable.
Well, you're a pragmatist, bill.
That's a quality that I admire in a man.
Luck is a lady, and this one's on the house.
Luck is female, but she ain't no lady.
When the lights are out, neither am I.
Hi, marshal.
How many of 'em are there?
Three.
Didn't mean to interrupt.
Ma'am.
Just here to escort you to Mr. Poe's.
I'll come when I'm good and ready.
Yes, sir.
Get outta here.
Close the door!
Like my new hotel?
It's nice, huh?
Bang!
You again, you little scoundrel.
Joey.
Fine boy you have here.
Get outta here, Joey.
Go on.
That young hellion takes after his mother.
Ah?
I'm afraid she's overindulged the boy.
Let me introduce you.
Gentlemen, this is our new marshal Mr. bill Hickok.
How do you do?
I, uh, hope that we can continue our discussion.
Scenery's better over there, isn't it?
Ah, yeah, well.
Excuse me, ladies,
I'd like to introduce our new lawman to ya.
And this beautiful creature is my betrothed, miss Mattie Lyles.
Well, ladies, most honored to make your acquaintances.
I hope that you come to see me as a protector and a friend in days to come.
Please feel free to call upon me anytime.
Excuse me.
Hi, darlin'.
Ow.
Okay, can't say I didn't deserve that.
I've been waitin' 10 years to do that.
You're a son of a bitch.
What?
You took off and never came back.
You could've written at least once.
Come on, I went to war, Mattie.
What did you expect?
I was dodging bullets, left, right, and center.
I didn't know where I was gonna live from one day to another.
Why am I not surprised?
It's good to see you.
How much?
How much what?
I know you, bill,
$200 and you forget you ever knew me.
Now, hold on.
I gain nothin' by telling your Mr. Poe anything.
I'm pleased to see you so happy.
300 for your silence and not a cent more.
Now, you're hurtin' my feelings.
When I was young and foolish,
I thought you were dashing and gallant, but now I see you for what you really are.
You're a liar.
You're a live-for-today hedonist with no ambition.
That's not true.
And you only have one particular skill.
Killin' people.
Stop here.
Whoa.
Give us a moment, Jerry.
What you fretting' about, Mattie?
I just don't understand how they can make a man like that marshal.
I just wish you'd use your influence on the town council, get rid of Hickok.
Was he in the army with your husband?
No.
I don't know him.
I just know his type.
He only cares about four things, shootin', drinkin', and gambling', and you can guess the last.
I suppose I can guess the last.
Don't you worry your pretty head about it any longer.
I'll take care of it.
Let's go, Jerry.
Sullivan!
Rise and shine.
Time to go home.
I am at home.
Then go to work.
I am at work.
I'm the jailer.
Well, that's handy.
What about me?
You know I have a farm that needs plowing'.
I'm gonna give you some more advice, son.
Drinking, gambling, and shootin', they don't mix, speaking from personal experience.
Best you stay there till you've learned your lesson.
I'll need money then.
Money?
What for?
For breakfast.
You need to feed the prisoner.
On the other hand, if as a result of my advice to take alcohol only in moderation and to never pull a gun at the poker table, you promise not to do it again, then I'll let you go,
but I'm keeping your gun.
You can't keep my gun.
You can't keep my gun, please.
Sullivan, let that idiot out.
May I help you, marshal?
Yes, yes, of course, I,
I would like to buy a hat.
What kind of hat?
Well, a lady's hat, but I don't know much about 'em, so I'd appreciate any suggestions you might have, Mattie.
You presume familiarity.
Oh.
You may call me, Mrs. Lyles, sir.
Mrs. Lyles.
You know, that name sounds familiar.
I swear I've heard it somewhere before.
Here.
Take it.
It's on the house.
Take it and leave.
No, no, no, I, I insist on paying.
You know, this is a nice place you have here,
Mrs. Poe.
I know what you're thinkin'.
And, yes, Philip did set me up in this little shop, and, yes, I am going to marry him,
so please just take your hat and get out of here.
I bought that hat for you, Mattie.
Howdy, bill.
This shit kicker drew on me first.
Look, I'm tellin' you it was a fair fight.
He got what was comin' to him.
You just killed an unarmed boy, Slade.
Oh my god!
You take care of him, all right, preacher?
Oh, don't you worry about that one little bit, marshal.
I'll make sure he gets a first-class sendoff.
I'm talkin' about the boy.
Okay.
Well, I'm gonna have to raise, boys.
Goddamn, Hickok!
I believe this belongs to you.
Looks to me like he belongs to the devil now.
You ordered this piece of horseshit to shoot the sodbuster.
Now why would I do that?
I didn't have no quarrel with the man.
He didn't pull his gun on me.
Slade had this comin' anyway.
Goon!
Come get this piece of shit off my pot.
Have a seat, Hickok, and I'll take your money.
God, they never stop.
Joey!
Joey!
Texas boys are here.
Don't get yourself killed now!
Oh, god almighty.
Doc!
Hold your horses.
I'm comin'.
Oh boy.
Ah, yeah.

Yeah, he caught a bullet.
Where's the bullet?
It's in his leg.
Okay.
Now, son, ah, god.
Okay, son, now, we're gonna have to pull the bullet out right away to stop the bleeding, okay?
So you gotta be brave.
I can't give you anything to go to sleep.
You're just gonna have to gut it out, okay?
You know what, we could give him a shot.
Okay?
Whiskey?
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, forget it, come on.
You look really tough.
You'll be brave, be a good soldier.
Okay?
Just count to 40, okay?
One, two.
One, two, three.
We're not goin' anywhere.
Grab his foot, hold his foot.
Let's see.
Okay, Joey, listen, I want you to listen to me.
I want you to listen to me real careful.
Look at me, look at me.
Why don't I tell you about the time that I was scouting' for my friend general Custer in the black hills.
I was far in advance of the column, okay?
And I found myself cutoff by Cheyennes, the most bloodthirsty savages you ever had the displeasure to meet.
Now, I managed to slip past 'em, and they chased me into a dead-end canyon with a little narrow passageway leading' in, and I knew that they could only come through one man at a time,
so I decided to make my stand there, okay?
So I turn around, and I'm ready, but they disappear.
Silence.
And bang!
Gunfire starts.
And you know who pops his head through?
A little ol' confederate boy, okay?
He's movin' so slow,
I put a bullet right between his, right between his eyes, and, uh, his friends,
they clamber over the top of him to come through.
And I drop another one and another one.
And this,
I'm outta bullets then, okay?
So I draw my knife, and I back up against the far wall.
By that time, they're crowding' around me.
What happened next?
Well, what could I do?
I was outgunned and outnumbered, out of ammo.
I only had my knife.
So what'd ya do?
I pissed my pants, doc.
Now bandage.
You're doin' good.
Just stay this quiet in here as you can.
I tell ya one thing, guns are good for business.
George.
Can I help ya, son?
I'm guessin' you heard about young Joey.
It ain't right that a grown boy can't horse around without risking a bullet.
And you're gonna tell me how to keep that from happenin'?
"The carrying of firearms within city limits
"is strictly prohibited."
No guns at all.
You leave 'em at camp, or ya check 'em into the marshal's office on the way into town.
You sure about this, son?
Some folks ain't gonna be too happy about this.
Yeah, well, they'll just have to live with it.
Boss, you know boys can't belly up to the bar if they're cuffed hand and foot to the marshal's desk.
Now where am I gonna sleep?
Bill, I want you to know
I'm a 100% in favor of what you're tryin' to do.
100% in principle, but I think we need to be practical here.
This ain't the only town they can drive cattle to.
My mind's made up, okay?
There's no changin' it.
And that goes for you, too.
Do I need to remind you of our arrangement?
Ben, put a goddamn cork in that bottle and sit it on its side facing me.
I see a lot of you sons of bitches violating' the no-guns ordinance.
So I'm gonna explain it to you real simple by uncorking that bottle there.
Anyone else beside me do that?
If not, kindly head to the bar.
Give your guns to Ben for safekeeping.
I'd like to give it a try, Mr. marshal.
Put another cork in the bottle, Ben.
Spin it.
Whoo.
What do they call you, son?
Hardin, John Wesley Hardin.
You born somewhere?
Most likely somewhere.
You best get back to somewhere.
Oh, I don't know, I kinda like it here.
Think I'll stay for a while.
I recognize you now.
You're not a John Wesley Hardin, you're Wesley Clemmons.
Folks call you little Arkansas.
That's a new one, little Arkansas.
You know, you might almost be as fast as me.
Ben, pour Arkansas a drink on me.
Rest of you, keep givin' your guns to the bartender.
Sully will pick 'em up later.
Can I do somethin' for you?
Yeah, mayor, you can do somethin' about that young marshal of yours.
Boy's runnin' all of my customers out of town.
Now, listen to me, you son of a bitch.
Ain't no one stopping' them boys from drinkin' the swill you call whiskey.
Now, you listen to me.
If it weren't for my businesses, you wouldn't have no goddamn town.
You'd just blow away in the dust.
Ain't right messin' with a man's livelihood.
And I'd hate to see your young marshal meet with some unhealthy accident while he's performing his duties.
I stand by my decision.
Now get your ass off my property.
Before I put a bullet in you.
I say we teach this Yankee dandy a lesson.
Ride out to camp, pick up the spare guns.
And a strong rope.
Invite wild bill to a little necktie party.
Good afternoon.
Can I help you?
We don't much like your new ordinances.
Yeah, we don't much like you.
Is that so?
That's so.
We reckon it's time you leave Abilene for good.
The next person to move, I cut in half.
You boys put your tails between your legs, and you get outta here.
Get.
Yeah, we'll be seein' you real soon.
You take care now, Yankee.
Hi, darlin', how was your day?
It was all right, Mattie.
How was yours?
It was good.
I see ya found 'em.
The pearls.
Oh, uh, I must've taken 'em off when I was cleanin'.
Well, you should be more careful.
Allow me.
There, back where they belong.
Now what are you so excited about, son?
You should've seen him!
Wild bill took on a 100 men!
He's one tough fella.
A 100 men, you say?
Hmm.
Don't move a muscle.
You used to like it when I moved.
I don't know if you're aware of it, but you're a hero in Joey's eyes.
Do me a favor.
Tell 'em not to be like you.
I'll walk you home.
Why?
Who are you tryin' to protect?
Me or Poe?
You stay down.
Goddammit.
Give me two.
Mr. Hardin, you're pretty fast with a gun.
So I've been told.
From what I saw, you may be the fastest.
You may be the best.
I'm gonna take two.
What are you gonna do if wild bill asks you for your guns?
Well, he ain't asked yet.
These drovers, all from the south,
Texas mostly, and they don't much cotton to Yankee lawmen.
I'm just sayin' if somethin' was to happen to wild bill, we'd need a new marshal.
You want me to kill wild bill for nothin'?
You never get somethin' for nothin'.
No, there's a reward,
$500 reward.
Isn't that ironic.
A bounty on a lawman.
You in?
If you're so anxious to see wild bill dead, why don't ya kill him yourself?
If you want somethin' done right, you oughta hire the best.
You know, somethin' tells me, Poe, you're not an honest man.
Let's just say, I ain't easy to beat.
It's time to fish or cut bait.
Somethin's gotta be done about little Arkansas.
The son of a bitch is wearin' his guns in plain view.
You can harness a mule, but you teach a horse to run.
Let's, uh, make this drink for long nights of no rest.
Little Arkansas,
I'm callin' you out.
I'll be in the street waiting'.
Well, sorry about that rude interruption.
Save the last dance for me.
Drop your guns or I'm gonna arrest you.
You want my guns?
Okay.
Take 'em.
What you lack in sense, you certainly make up for in gumption.
Don't you know anythin'?
I invented the road agent's spin.
I didn't know you were that old, marshal.
Well, it's a funny thing.
Older I get, the more I learn.
Well, if you'd like to keep learning',
I'd holster that pistol of yours.
Notice my hammer tied back?
If something should happen to cause my thumb to slip, you will catch a bullet right between your eyes.
Well, I can't see what good it's gonna do me to surrender my guns, if you're just gonna go ahead and shoot me in the back the second I turn and walk away.
You have been misinformed, sir.
I never shoot a man in the back.
How 'bout a compromise?
What do you say to a drink?
I say all right.
You know, there's a rumor going around about you, says that you were a Yankee spy during the war.
It was a stupid war.
Well, you know the only way you're gonna get these guns off me, marshal, is if ya kill me.
I'm considering' it.
If I let you loose, pretty soon every bowlegged son of a bitch is gonna be wearin' his guns, too.
I can't allow that.
I understand your problem.
I do.
It's just I ain't ready to leave town yet, and I sure as hell ain't taking' these guns off.
You remind me of someone.
Well, he sounds handsome, who?
It's not important.
The point is, you got potential.
You just might do.
Do what?
You want me to be a lawman?
Pay is a $100 a month, a lot more than a drover makes.
What do ya say, little Arkansas?
Well, I say Poe offered me $500 for just one day of work.
There's two ways you're leavin' this office wearing' those guns of yours, feet first,
or wearing' that badge.
Can I ask you somethin', marshal?
Mm-hmm.
Why do you call me Arkansas?
'Cause if you were John Wesley Hardin, we'd have to hang you.
Arkansas it is.
I usually take a different route on these patrols, keep the bushwhackers guessing'.
Why the shotgun?
Seems to me a rifle would be a little more accurate.
Well, this here's what I call preventative medicine.
Sawed-off filled with blue whistles is a mighty fine deterrent.
Well, I've never had to shoot twice at the same man.
There's somethin' you gotta learn about gunfightin'.
Oh, yeah, what's that?
No matter how fast you are, there's always someone faster.
The more you use your gun, the sooner you're gonna run into that man.
I reckon I still got some time before I meet that man.
Last chance, hand 'em over, Arkansas.
Come get it, marshal!
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!
You wanna come upstairs?
Not tonight, darlin'.
Much obliged.
Consider it done.
There's a lot of vagrancy in this part of town.
Keep your eyes skinned.
The lawman has no friends and few sympathizers.
A momentary benevolence can prove fatal.
I don't intend to die of an excess of benevolence.
Well, I don't think you got... you see him?
See him, I got him.
You can't see him?
Yeah, yeah, I can see him.
You know this dandy here?
Yeah, I know him.
Well, we're lucky he's about as accurate a shooter as you.
You just killed an old man, marshal.
Time for you to meet your maker.
I'll see you in hell, Hickok!
I wanna help the marshal patrol!
Ow!
I want you to stay away from wild bill.
You are not to see or speak to that man again.
You hear me?
Do you hear me?
Whenever I look into a light of any kind, it's edged with halos, bright as January sun dogs.
Well, ya have a film over your eyes,
and it'll be all right for a while, but in five years.
In five years what?
Total blindness.
I can't help you, but you can help yourself.
You're at a point where you can make a decision, and you must make a decision.
You can take the path of a boy, reckless and careless and stupid,
or you can take a higher road
and become a man.
Become a man by plowing' fields, huh?
Is that what you're suggesting?
Look, bill, get an easier profession, start leading a different kind of a life.
This is all I've been good at my whole life, doc.
What am I gonna do?
You cannot ignore this, bill.
You must not ignore it, 'cause it isn't gonna go away.
All right.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this information to yourself.
You're a patient.
I'm a doctor.
Strictly confidential.
This stays confidential, or your wife's gonna end up a widow, doc.
I'm serious, doc.
I seen you with the drinking.
When you drink, you talk.
You wear a badge.
I'm a doctor.
It's strictly confidential, trust me.
I took an oath.
Okay, well you remember your oath, and you keep your mouth shut.
Thanks for the good news.
I got somethin' I want you all to do.
I want you all to spread the word that that son of a bitch is moon-blind.
He can't see in the goddamn dark.
Hello, Fred.
Mr. Poe.
Moon-blind.
Can ya handle that?
Yeah, boss.
We got that.
Go on.
How are you, Fred?
Very good, sir.
Name your poison.
Well, I'll have, uh, a barrel of the old Kentuckian, and then, uh, half-dozen barrels of the usual.
One old Kentuckian and just, just a half-dozen barrels?
Half dozen, Fred.
Say, Mr. Poe, uh, did a bill Hickok come through here recently?
They call him, uh, wild bill.
Name sounds familiar.
Well, Hickok was acquainted to a relative of mine, uh, a miss Mattie silks.
She was engaged to some fancy fella, if I remember.
Mr. Poe's also engaged, but the lady's name is Lyles, Mattie Lyles.
Lyles?
Well, that was Mattie's mother's name.
Hmm.
Thank you, Mr. Poe.
What do you want?
Well, I,
I brought a present for the boy.
A walking stick, useful for getting around.
Also, useful against bloodthirsty savages.
Wow, thanks!
You're welcome.
And for the lady of the house, fresh-cut flowers, all the way from Kansas City.
Joey, give it back, it's dangerous.
Ah, mom.

Yes, ma'am.
Tend to your chores.
Do as your mother says, boy.
Yes, sir.
Your flowers are also unwelcome and a mistake.
You're the one makin' a mistake, Mattie.
You can't marry that man.
I'm begging you.
Well, it's my mistake, and it ain't my first one either.
As I recall, I was your first mistake.
I'm not proud of that, or the life I led, but that all ended once I had Joey.
I still care for you, Mattie.
I know you care for me.
You need to leave.
Poe will be here soon.
Whatever shortcoming's he may have, he's punctual.
What about last night?
It never happened.
Mattie.
Sit down.
Had a long talk with an old friend of yours today.
Fred Finley.
So, tell me, miss Lyles, or is it miss silks,
how exactly did your husband get killed?
What battle?
Little round top.
No more lies!
You bastard.
That's the only bastard around here, and I raised him as my own.
You know what, Mattie?
I'll give you a job at the bull's head.
I can always use another good whore down there.
Come, baby.

It's okay, it's okay.
I'm sorry he hit you.
I didn't know you were the prince of pistoleers.
I better not find out this came from you.
You're crowding' me, bill.
And I don't like to be crowded.
I don't like to be lied to.
You lyin' to me?
No.
Good.
Can I help you, son?
I think my demons have finally caught up with me.
Every man has demons, son.
A man's demons though quiet
are never quite silent.
She was my light, the thing that kept the demons in the dark.
I'm, I'm sorry.
Only god can forgive you now, you son of a bitch.
No one can run forever, son.
You quit, you surrender, they'll dog your heels till the day you die.
But not if you face it.
Now ask yourself which you'd rather live with.
I'm sorry.
Where is he?
Please don't.
Please.
Let's go, we have to go.
Get your things.
Keep your heads down!
We must've got him.
Guns are not allowed in town no more.
That ain't no law anymore.
There's a new lawman in town.
Tickets, please.
Tickets, please.
Listen, when you get to Wichita, you seek out a man named Earp, okay?
He's a good man.
He'll take care of you.
Tickets, please.
Come with us, bill.
You know I can't.
I have to finish this, Mattie.
I've been runnin' my entire life.
You're still runnin'.
It's time for you to hang up your guns.
If you stay, we can't wait for you.
I'll wait for you, wild bill.
You do as your mother says, boy.
I know why you're goin' back.
You're goin' back 'cause you're a hero.
I'm gonna back 'cause I'm a coward.
Sometimes it takes more courage to walk away.
You be a man, take care of your mother for me, okay?
Tickets, please.
You got me, sir.
He's my hero.
He's your daddy.
You ain't gonna try to stop me, are ya?
No.
Reckon you'll want this.
Poe!
Wouldn't shoot me in the back, would ya, Hickok?
Guess not.
$500 to the man that kills wild bill.
I'll show you wild, Hickok.
Wild bill, my ass!
I'll show ya wild!
You're not so wild, Hickok!
Yeah, you piece of shit!
Goddammit.
I'm done running.
