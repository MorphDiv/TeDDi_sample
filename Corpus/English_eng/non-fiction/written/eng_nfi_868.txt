Previously on AMC's "Better Call Saul"...
- You okay?

You know, she's gonna hate you when this is over.
I came because I thought it was the right thing.
You've been sold a bill of goods, Rebecca.
Jimmy:

- the mind of Charles McGill.

Don't you know by now this is real?
Could you reach into your breast pocket?
- Alley:

My trucks are already at maximum capacity.
Make room.
[Spanish music playing]
[Coffee pot thumps]
You're good.
See ya, Nacho.

[Grunts softly]

[Music continues]
Hola, Don Hector.
Hey, Nacho.
Have a seat.
How's your dad?
Uh, fine.
- Business good?

- Cool.

Hey, my father's gonna bring in his Corolla.
His dogs tore up the back seat.
Like, ate the stuffing.
[Snaps fingers]
So, um, one of my guys... new kid... got spooked by a cruiser and ran.
Dumped his stash in the gutter...
Let me finish.
You're light.
Like I was saying, the guy's...
Why didn't you make it up on your end?
I did, but I couldn't make it all up.
You got my share, man.
I swear.
All right.
Make it up next week.
Thank you, Nacho.
Don Hector.

Kim:

Jimmy McGill has worked tirelessly to build a practice that helps an underserved and frankly overlooked segment of our community... the elderly.
You've heard from many of Mr. McGill's clients today.
Every one of them came here gladly in support of their lawyer.
Jimmy McGill reached out to people who otherwise may never have seen an attorney in their entire lives.
He took the time to make sure they had wills that accurately reflected their wishes, for a price they could afford, because Jimmy McGill cares about people.
He's devoted the past three years of his life to his brother's welfare.
Waking at 5:00 in the morning to buy Charles' favorite newspaper from the single newsstand in the city that carries it.
Dropping everything to care for his brother through multiple hospitalizations.
Even supporting Charles' career by hand-making a Mylar-lined suit jacket to spare his brother discomfort from exposure to electricity.
[Vehicle door slides open]
And yet, during this time,
Charles McGill's irrational animus towards his brother...
- grew to epic proportions.

So when Jimmy discovered that Charles had used his love and his caring against him, when he discovered he had been betrayed by his only living blood relative...
Jimmy snapped.
Wouldn't you?
I might.
[Knock on door]
Chuck?
Jimmy McGill understands he broke the law when he forced his way into his brother's house, and he is deeply sorry.
He's more than ready to face the consequences.
However, as to ethical violation 16-304 (A), the State Bar's claim of destruction of evidence... it categorically did not happen.
Jimmy McGill had no premeditated agenda when he entered his brother's home.
- He lost his temper...

- ... plain and simple.

So now the question you must ask yourselves is this...
Is the legal profession better with Jimmy McGill in it?
I believe the answer is a resounding yes.
- [Cork pops] Oh!

- Here's to 12 short months.

Also, somebody call the Pope because according to your summation,
I oughta be a saint.

Right up there with her.
St. Jimmy.

Boom.
Ahhh.
[Chuckles, inhales]
[Sighs, chuckles]
So... have you given any thought to what you're gonna do for the next year... you know, with your clients?
[Chuckling] Whoa!

That is tomorrow talk, Counselor.
Tonight, I celebrate with the world's best defense attorney.
Where are your notes?

- see what happens.

It's a good plan.
[Knock on door]
[Knocking continues]
[Knocking continues]
Rebecca?
Jimmy.
- Well, I'm...

- Hi.

We didn't formally meet earlier.
- Right.

Um, I-I was, uh, just at Chuck's, and he won't answer the door.
I-I was out there knocking for almost an hour.
[Chuckling] That sounds like Chuck.
I'm sure he's fine.

Oh, well, I think it's a little bit more than that.
I want you to come with me to get him to let us in.
[Chuckles]
Jimmy, he needs our help.
No thanks.

I've already kicked my door in for the year.
You owe it to him.
I don't owe him squat.
[Sighs]
Jimmy, you lied to me.
This was never about helping Chuck.
If you feel misled, I apologize, but I think I was clear.
I told you I had to defend myself and Chuck would need help afterwards, which he does.
You got what you wanted.
Now it's time to do what's right.
Yeah...
No.
Jimmy, he's still your brother.
[Smacks lips] Not anymore, he's not.
Chuck was right about you all along.
He's mentally ill.
What is your excuse?
Enjoy your champagne.
[Footsteps depart]
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
Like the other night during dinner,
Kaylee asked if her daddy ever used to cook.
And I told her about... how Matty used to make her Mickey Mouse pancakes on weekends.
You know, two small pancake ears attached to a big one?
She didn't remember, but I think it made her happy.
She even asked for them the next morning.
[Chuckles]
[Chuckling] Boy, Matty made it look easy.
And keeping the ears separated is really hard.
Mine looked terrible.
But Kaylee didn't care.
Now she wants "Daddy pancakes" every weekend.
[Light laughter]
But... there are times...
Career day's coming up, and she asked me if I would go and talk about her daddy's job.
She wants to know more about what he did.
And that kind of took my breath away.
Kaylee's teacher thinks it would be good for her, maybe make his absence feel... a little bit more... normal.
Man:

I don't know.
- Maybe.

That's good work, Stacey.
So, who's next?
Stacey:

Mike:

I'm all for it.
Enough that you'd come again?
[Engine starts]
- We'll see.

What?
To help with the new playground.
The kids deserve way better than that, don't you think?
Sure, but why me?
Well, they need someone who knows how to pour concrete.
And the slide and the swings need something called footings, I think.
Sweetheart, that's not really my department.
Sure it is, Pop.
You built a carport when Matty was a kid.
I did?
Yeah.

He said that when you were pricing it out, you thought that all the people who gave you quotes were crooks,
[Chuckling] so you decided to do it yourself.
And you let Matty write his initials in the wet cement.
[Vehicle departs]
Pop, the way he talked about you, it was like you... hung the moon.
Sorry.

- I just thought it was...

- Just tell me when and where.

Come on.

[Inhales sharply]
Thank you. [Sniffles]
- [Engine shuts off] - [Dog barking in distance]
[Crickets chirping]
[Mailbox door creaks]
[Clattering]
[Knock on door]
Chuck?

[Knock on door]
[Clock ticking]
[Dog barking in distance]
[Knock on door]
Chuck, it's Howard!
[Knock on door]
I'm not leaving, Chuck!
I don't want to wake up the neighbors, but I got all night!
[Knock on door]
Chuck?

[Clock ticking]
[Footsteps depart]
[Insects chirping]
[Doorknob rattles]
[Chuck sighs]
[Gas hissing]
That is a 35-year-old Macallan.
I'm not gonna tell you how much it cost, but don't worry... it's coming out of my end.
The opinion came in.
Jimmy was suspended for 12 months.
This is a win, my friend.
I know, it doesn't feel like it.
But hear me out.
Jimmy's not gonna be a lawyer for one year.
And if he screws up, which we both know is likely, his PPD terminates and that one year may turn into forever.
[Clock ticking, gas hissing]
Chuck, you're at a crossroads.
You can keep looking backwards, stay focused on your brother, what he's up to, or you can go forward.
And, Chuck, listen to me...
Jimmy's just not worth it.
Where would we be if... say, Clarence Darrow had devoted the best years of his life to supervising his ne'er-do-well relatives?
Think of the cases he wouldn't have taken, the injustices that would have gone unanswered.
What a waste.
I say... put your energy into the future.
[Cork pops softly]
Anything else... is a waste of your time and intellect.
What do you say?
[Sniffs]
[Sighs]
[Clock ticking, gas hissing]
[Inhales sharply]
To new beginnings.
To new beginnings.
Mmm.
You okay to drive?
Absolutely.
How are you feeling?
Oh, I'm fine.

Hi.

It's Francesca at Jimmy McGill's office.
- [Sighs]

Okay.

Mrs. Adamson.
Hello, dear.

I just wanted you to be the first to know, uh, that I'll be taking a brief sabbatical from the law, just one year.
One quick trip of the Earth around the Sun, and I'll be back.
I will.
♪ ♪
[Sighs] Next.
- Hold for Jimmy.

I did?

And how did he pass?
Next!
The details will all be in a letter you'll receive shortly.
Mostly legal boilerplate.
Now, you give that nephew a hug for me.
Niece!
Next!
- Hold for Jimmy.

It's just a technical thing, really.

It's just a technical, uh... an agreement.
It's an agreement...
It's an agreement that I came to with the Bar Association, and you're gonna get a letter with all the details, so...
Mr. Levine, can you hear me?

Hello?

Okay, just...

You stop talking, and then I'll talk.
Okay.

The letter will explain it, but the... the details are just boring legalistic mumbo-jumbo.
I don't know where those sounds are coming from, sir.
You... you'll have to check.
Well, then, stay inside!
Details will be in a letter... that's right, but d-don't worry about it.
Next.

Next.

Yes, Mrs. Pressman, I still have the document.
I'm including the calico.
Now I don't wanna get down into the weeds on this with you, sir.
It's just my headache, sir.

Listen to you.
Where'd you learn so much about lawyering?
Yes, just watch your mail for that letter from my office.
Okay.

- Next!

Last one.
[Scoffs]
[Telephone beeps]
Mr. Yalowitz.
Hey, it's Jimmy McGill.
Listen, for your future lawyering needs,
I am taking a hiatus of one year.
Will you please watch your mail for a letter from my office?
Yes, Jimmy from TV.
[Chuckling] You watch it every day, huh?
Really?
Were you the pilot of the B-29?
32 missions?
[Chuckling] Holy...
Well, c-can I just say, sir, that you are one of the people who made the greatest generation so damn great?
I salute you.
A'ight, see you soon.
On TV, right.
Bye.
[Receiver clicks]
[Chuckles]
[Water bubbling]
Francesca, get me KWBV!
Okay.
[Inhales sharply]
[Telephone buttons clicking]
[Telephone beeps]
Get me the manager. [Scoffs]
Then get me somebody who can pull a commercial, stat!
[Crickets chirping]
[Sighs]
You finish making your calls?
Yeah.

[Clears throat]
But what gets me is this.
What is it?
It is my KWBV contract.
I almost let one of my ads run today.
You can't do that.
I know, but can you believe this?
I've got nine airings left.
I'm out 4,000 bucks.
[Scoffs]
I guess... you have to find a local business and try to sell 'em your time.
- What else can you do?

This pile of garbage explicitly states
I'm not allowed to resell.
You're a lawyer.

I cannot look at another contract.
I'm up to my eyeballs in Mesa Verde.
Yeah.

So, what do you want to do about Francesca?
[Clears throat]
Do about her?

Yeah, how much notice should we give her?
Two weeks?
Well, we're not doing her any favors by keeping her in the dark.
She should start looking.
[Chuckles]
So you want to fire Francesca?
I don't want to, but...
I don't need her for more than filing and getting coffee, [Chuckling] and I can do that myself.
We just hired her.

While we're on the subject, we need to talk about the overhead on this place.
No, Kim, no!
This office is set up for two legal practices, and now there's only one.
I don't need all this space.

It's a huge client!
I looked into it, and breaking the lease will cost a hell of a lot less than 10 months' rent.
No, we didn't go through all this just to give up everything after one day of suspension.
One day!
It's not everything.
It's an office.
Four walls and a door. [Chuckles]
Why waste money on something w-we don't need?
As... as far as I'm concerned, nothing's changed, all right?
I'll hold up my end, you hold up yours. 50-50.
So you're gonna keep paying for half a law office even though you're not practicing law?
- Call it "aspirational thinking."

But how are you gonna pay for it?
[Inhales sharply]
The day I don't show up with my half, that's the day we'll talk about closing this place.
That's fair, I guess.
You'll see.
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
[Sighs]
Look at the two of you.
I mean, you belong on TV!
You're naturals!
I know.
You're thinking it's too good to be true.
I mean, "TV's too expensive.
We can't afford that."
Well, I'm telling you, you can.
And here's the beauty part...

Hey!

That's right.

Well, what I did for me, my friends,
I will do that for you.
Look, our all-inclusive Premium package... that's gonna be the best bang for your buck.
We'll shoot nine commercials for $4,900.
Okay?

That is a prime slot with a viewership of tens of thousands of potential customers.
[Inhales deeply]
- It does sound like a good deal.

It's a lot of money.
Well... that's... that's perfectly understandable.
It's a big financial commitment.
Uh, that's why we have our, uh,
"Toe-in-the-Water" package.
That's, uh, one commercial, flat rate,
$849.95.
Beauty part again... free airtime.
And when this thing runs, you're gonna get calls...
I can promise you that. [Chuckles]
We'll think about it.
Excellent.
When, uh, do you think you might decide?
- Maybe next week.

Wow.
Gee, I'm sorry for any confusion, but I was talk...

How short?
We would have you on the air by 3:20 this afternoon.
[Chuckling] Today?
You're gonna shoot a commercial in the next 2 1/2 hours?
Oh, no. [Chuckles] I mean, there's a whole post process.
I mean, there's editing and mixing, coloring, layback.
It's a whole megillah.

But we would need to be shooting in the next 15 minutes.
[Bell dings]
Woman:

Man:

- Man #2:

Which one was that?

No.

Jimmy:

[Inhales sharply]
[Sighs]
- [Sighs]

No!

That's another 400 bucks down the drain.
How do I find somebody who needs a commercial and can afford one?
[Sighs]
Maybe... you could make a commercial?
Have you not been listening?
That's what I've been trying...
Oh.

No.

- Sure you can.

No!
We... we're totally off-brand here.
I'm Jimmy McGill, a lawyer you can trust.
I can't suddenly turn into...
Commercial Guy.
Hold on.
Uh, repeat after me...
Uh, "For a limited time, we'll shoot your commercial today
"and have it on the air tomorrow."
For a limited time, we'll shoot your commercial today and have it on air tomorrow.
I thought you were, like, president of the Drama Club or something?
I'm Treasurer.
You, go!
Say the words.
Uh, uh... uh, for a limited, uh, time, o-only you... we could, um...
Cut.

[Sighs]
Woof.
[Inhales sharply, sighs]
We gonna do this or not?
'Cause either way, I'm getting my 100 bucks.

So what happened?
[Inhales deeply]
They called him.
And, uh, while we were waiting to see what he'd say, one of the guys put a gun to my head.
They put a gun to your head?
Mm-hmm.
It was no big deal.
[Cellphone ringing]
Lionel.
Go outside.

- [Cellphone beeps]

[Coughs]
[Door creaks]
So... your father... his shop.
W-where does he get his upholstery?
From, uh, the distributor.
And w-where is the distributor?
- Jalisco.

I want... a new way to get my stuff over the border.
A legitimate business.
Right.

Temporary.
I want a new front...
My own.
Don Hector, my father is a simple man.
He is not in the business.
You will teach him.
- Don Hector, please don't...

I'll take good care of Papi.

Lionel talked to our guy in Los Lunas.
Looks like Tuco knifed a guy.
But he definitely broke a guard's jaw.
- They got him in solitary.

- as soon as you see the first one, - [Door closes] you're gonna want the whole package.
Um, take about an hour.
Um, so, I'll bring the whole team down there.
We'll be there 12:30 sharp.
I'm gonna turn you into a star.
Absolutely.

[Chuckling] I know.

Okay.

It's a film-making term.
Just... just don't wear stripes.
Okay.

[Cellphone beeps]
- [Sighs]

Yes.

So, sleeping in your own bed tonight.
Things must be lookin' up.
I needed clean clothes.
What was all that?
Well, I'm unloading that ad time.
But I thought you couldn't sell it.
Well, that's the thing...

Uh, they pay me to make a commercial,
I throw in the airtime for free.
- Smart.

I spent most of the day going door-to-door, pitching.
No dice.

I'm selling advertising...

And it worked.
I mean, TV commercials get calls.
What commercial did you run?
Not... not "Gimme Jimmy"?
No.

W-When?

Today.
- Right here.

- for commercials today.

I'm starting to think I might break even here.
[Chuckles]
O-okay.

Eeeesh, I don't know.
It's not my best work.
It's, um, very last-minute.
Well, you're getting calls.

Yeah.
Wha... now you're getting shy?
[Chuckles]
- Come on.

Okay, but keep in mind...
Yeah, it's... yeah, it's not your best work.
I got it.

Well, you better think again!
You can't afford not to be on TV!
Look at you... you're a triple threat!
Great services, great products, and most of all, that face!
You're a star!
Wrap it all up in your natural charisma, and bam!
You belong on TV!
Better watch out for autograph hounds and paparazzi!
- [Ding!

I can have you on the air tomorrow.
You heard me right... tomorrow!
Better get ready to be famous, Albuquerque!
I can make you a TV star for a price you can afford!
Call me, Saul Goodman!
The world needs to know about you and your business!
[Echoing] Call me now!
[Sighs]
The guy at the station said he's never seen so many star wipes in a row.
[Clicks tongue] It's never been done.
- "Saul Goodman."

It's like, "s'all good, man." [Chuckles]
That guy has a lot of energy.
Yeah.
It's just a name.
[Sighs]
Huh.
