What have you got there?
I hope you don't mind.

The scene where Adelle confronts Hustings.

Right before he ties her to the tree, and she's sure she's going to die.
Oh, my goodness, the drama.
You like that, do you?
"You don't understand us at all.
"Americans.
"You think because we smile at each other at church on Sundays
"and plant gardens and help each other across the street
"that we're pushovers.
"But we built this place from the ground up.
"This country.
"And there's not one of us who wouldn't give his last breath
"to stop you from harming one branch, one brick,
"one twig of it.
That is who we are, Mr. Hustings."
I'm sorry, I mangled it, I know.
I'll make us some breakfast.
Betsy, would you take this out and put it in the trunk of my car, please?
Thank you.
I was hoping you weren't serious about this.
A painter.

It's for a friend.
Well, that's a relief.
I'm surrounded by too many artists as it is.
You know, Rose, I always thought of you as more of a people person.
Like you, Pat?
Will you be home for dinner tonight?
I wouldn't wait.
I've got drinks with Sally Sweet's manager.
Not an easy woman, that one.
That's not what I heard.
Have you seen this?
We're developing your anti-fascist picture, aren't we?
Pictures take too long, Daddy.

Such as?

Relief for the Jews.
I need relief fromthe Jews.
What?
Nobody can take a joke anymore?
We are all refugees from Europe, gentlemen.
Some of us just got here first.
Monroe?
We're a movie studio.
I think that's enough to keep us busy, don't you?
That's your answer?
What about the fact that you're Jewish?
Get me Sy Green in the music department.
And have some invitations made.
We're throwing a party.
Right away, Mr. Stahr.
You took the Nazis' own words and put them into the mouths of criminals and madmen.
Your idea for "Enemy Among Us."
Goebbels banned my film, but...

It's not enough.
Movies are not enough.
Next weekend, there will be a dinner at the home of Salka Viertel.
There will be like-minded people there.
Artists, emigres from Central Europe.
You should come.
it's three minutes to my close-up.
You're easy to light.
The glow from within.
Oh, Pat.

Yesterday's rushes were the best so far.
If you're tired of the same good news every day, how about this:
I got five more scripts sitting on my desk, every bit as good, waiting for you.
Minna Davis's unfinished library.
You'll make them your own, just like you did this one.
Let's just get this one in the can first, and then we'll talk.
I already know everything I need to know.
I want Brady-American to be your home.
You want to lock me up?
In a golden cage.
Of your own design.
I got a message you needed to see me.
I've got a tour starting in ten minutes.
Well, you won't be late.
I want to test you for Adelle.
You were meant to play her.
Trust me.

One speech, on a lounge chair.
I know what I heard.
I'm not an actress.
I think you are.
You see how much I believe in you?
You're very sweet.
And I'm glad that you love me, but this is delusional.
I'd have that destroyed if I were you.
People might lose faith in your judgment.
I'll see you later.
It's quiet here at lunchtime.
Why does he want it?

We haven't finished the latest set of notes.
I'm just the messenger.

Okay, messenger, but tell him no more notes until I say so.
See ya.
Is there something else?
You want to go riding with me?
What?

Unless you don't like horses, 'cause I love horses, and I haven't ridden since I was in Oklahoma.
So I thought...
Is this a date?
What?
No... well, calling it a date might...
Besides, I can't afford an actual date right now, with food and things like that.
Maybe Saturday?
I know I'm not much of a catch.
Max.

Unless that was just research.
Oh, I'm sorry.

Both.
Definitely both.
Well, I'm busy on Saturday.
Otherwise, it was a very sweet offer.
And I do like horses.
Cowboy.
Tell the caterers we'll be 40, at least.
The usual guest list.
And I'll take a look at the menu tomorrow.
Would you like me to arrange for entertainment?
That won't be necessary.
You have to be honest with me.
Was that idea for you or for me?
Why would it be for me?
Because I'm just a tour guide.
I'm afraid that you can't love someone unless the whole world loves her with you.
Is that really what you think?
I'm asking you.
All day long, I am surrounded by people who want to be more than what they are.
Actors who want to be directors, directors who want to be producers.
You're the only one I know who wants to be less.
You have this...
I-I don't have the word for it...

Hidden.
But I can see it.
I can.
That's my talent.
It may be my only talent.
So, you can hate me for saying this, but... to stay a tour guide and tell someone else's stories when someone else should be telling stories about you...
We live a short time, Kathleen.
And what would happen?
I mean... who would direct the screen test?
I would.
For now, you're my secret.
He said I have something.
Your drama teacher?

Said you have something?

I think he meant cooties.
Shut up, Nathan.

Possibilities, to stand out.
So, I-I was thinking, if you could introduce me to a producer on the lot.
Like what happened to Lana.
Okay.
Okay, uh, I could think about that.
I might just have to work a little bit longer first.
I'd need to get photographs.
But they want a picture of you that they can keep.
Mm-mm.
We can't afford that.

No, it isn't.
And you're planning these dates with Celia.
That costs money.
Being a movie star is pie in the sky.
You and the boss's daughter is pie in the sky.
I didn't walk all the way from Oklahoma just for this.
Just so you know.
Ah.
Guten Morgen.
Mein name ist Monroe Stahr.
Leopold Ferber, Mr. Stahr.
I-I speak English.

I am the konzertmeister of the orchestra.
Ah, welcome to Brady-American, Mr. Ferber.
Guten Morgen.

Willkommen.
Hallo.
Guten Morgen.
Fantastic.

"Angels on the Avenue," cue number one.
Our weekly meeting?
I waited in your office for half an hour.
Sounds like my mistake.
I read the latest set of drafts and left my notes for your secretary.
I have to commend you.
The Vienna National Orchestra has always been my personal favorite.
But that's quite an expense, traveling an entire orchestra across an ocean.
They were playing in Chicago.
I arranged for them to extend their stay.
We Germanic peoples do have a certain knack for Romanticism.
I somehow doubt that's how you're going to be remembered.
Star that one.
Hello.
Do you speak English?
Ein bisschen.
A little.
I studied in school.
I'm Aubrey Hackett.
Hannah Taub.
Yeah, I-I'm one of the writers.
Hmm.
Did you write this movie?
No.
Nice to meet you, anyway.
Are you excited... to be in Hollywood?
What?
Hollywood.

Are you excited?

Vienna is the capital of music.
So now I am in your capital.
I would prefer to be home.
Well, we do have Schoenberg now, you know.
Leo?
It's good we meet in America, then.
Here we can still speak.
I would say once friends, always friends, but...
Friends look backward.
We only look forward.
"Not a love seat.
I am not the queen of..."
Now you're spoiling me.
From Mr. Brady.
Hmm. "Dear Margo, now you can have your cake and eat it, too."
Manipulative little bastard.
What?
That man would do anything for you.
And his partner will make a better actress out of you, in better pictures.
Nowhere else offers that.
Whew.
You look tired.
I'm fine.
Makeup's ready for you, Miss Taft.

Lucille, will you find an icebox for the pie and take these to wardrobe?

Ready.
Yes, I love that.
Anyone see what happened?

Did she faint?
I think she might be dead.
I can leave you alone.
No one even told me.
They put her body in an icebox.
They took her to the morgue and left me here working, like I wouldn't want to be disturbed!
I need to see her again.
She was wonderful.
Kind and... gentle.
And smart.

And, forgive me if I'm wrong, but... she wasn't your maid, was she, Margo?
Justyour maid?
Yes.

She was just...

It's safe with me.
Tell me about your mother.
My mother?
My mother was a lion.
She was a lion, Mr. Stahr.
She gave her whole life to me.
She was the daughter of a slave.
I am...
I am the granddaughter of a slave.
But you mustn't tell anyone that.
No.

N-No one.

Of course not.

There would be people who would be so angered, they would try to hurt me.
It's a secret.
It stays a secret.
Look what Lucille made.
In one generation.
Margo Taft.
I mean, isn't that something?
How far she came?
Yes, yes.

But her-her entire life, she was, she was invisible.
None of you ever looked at her and thought,
"This is Lucille.
"Lucille, who is special, who is unlike anyone else who has ever lived."
You just...

So, yes, she came very far... and yet nowhere at all.
Hello.

Good evening.
Hi.
Comfortable?

Good.
Uh, sorry.
Um...
I wanted to come visit you all sooner, but it's been a busy day.
Busier than I expected.
All of this was planned so suddenly, there was no way to secure proper lodging for so many of you.
But it's only for a few days, and the food on the lot is good.
Anything we can do to make you feel more at home, we will.
Sleep well.
Vu iz dos botsimer?
Oh.

Men's on this side, women's on the other.
Danke.
Kaddish?
For my parents.
When did you lose them?
My father died in the World War.
My mother from the influenza.
I was raised by nuns.
Jewish nuns?
They were very kind.
They raised me as my parents would have.
How did you know the Kaddish?
Jewish.

No.
Born Milton Sternberg.
I know why some of us must, but what are you hiding from?
Shlof gezunt.
You shut down "Her Royal Shyness"?
For one day.
For Margo.
So she can visit the morgue.
You just bought me an orchestra from Europe.
You have any idea how much this is gonna cost me?
Because of her maid?
Something you should know.
Wanted to take a moment for us all to mourn... as a family.
Pictures are made by people, after all.
And it is the people who matter.
So while we can't bring back our beloved Lucille... we can remember her.
And what she meant to Margo.
Thank you very much.
Thanks for coming.
I'll remember this.
You are good.
Flowers, jewelry, minks.
Anyone could woo them that way.
But a memorial for a maid.
That's me.

Say, Monroe, you do throw the greatest parties, but this one seemed sort of spur of the moment.
What's the occasion?
It's not just movie stars who need taking care of, Pat.
See you tonight.
Oh, you poor dear.
We're lost without them, aren't we?
We are.
I have a wonderful girl, with a sister.
They're from somewhere in Georgia, I think.
She will make your whole house sparkle.
Thank you.

I mean sparkle, really.
So...
All right.
Take a big breath with me.
Now, ignore everything around you.
All the noise.
It's just you and the camera.
You barely have to do a thing, I promise.
The camera will see it all.
Just your face.
This face.
So be who you are.
This is not who I am.

Today you are Adelle in the world of this scene.
You can do that.
Soften that light, Charlie.
Max, tilt that top light down.
When you're ready.
Make sure everyone has a drink, and come find me if there are any problems.
Our first guests.
Wait till they see you on screen.
You really should let them in.

Ah, hello, Virginia.
Darryl, how are you?

Get yourself a drink.
And again.
Do you mind terribly if I pass up soda pop and go for the bubbly?
I could use some anesthesia right now.
Mother and daughter.
Case of the Monroes.
You?
What?
No.
No, just general ennui.
Parties always make you feel worse in the end.
I wonder why that is.
Courage.
I'm off to mingle.
It's good to see you.
I'll be right back.
How have you been?
Enjoy the party.
Bye.
What you have is mystery.
What?
No one knows anything about you.
You just popped up.
Like most people in this city.

At one point or another.
Like you, I imagine.
Mm.
What is it you'd like to know?
Your secret.
Oh!
Sorry.
Oh, your shoe.

Don't worry, I'll get some napkins.
Rose.
What?
What?

You can't blame someone for an accident.
Why are we whispering?
I don't want to make a scene.
Good idea.
We should go upstairs, you and me.
We can finish up there.
I'm not going upstairs.
She's lovely.
Do you know how much that hurts me?
Rose.
What?

Don't you ever miss me?
I missed Minna.
You got me through it, and I will always owe you for that.
Yes, you will.
What are you doing?
Are you threatening me?

I'm begging you.
Lots of men have more than one woman.
Look at my husband.
Why not you?
No secrets, you two.
It's time to rejoin the party.
You're right, Jack.
You are right.
Hey, give us a minute, will you?
Hmm.
I'm sorry I was the first one of us to find happiness.
Well, I didn't even have to look;

I'm in love, Rose.
What can I do?
Napkins.

Thank you.
You all right?

These parties are insufferable, aren't they?
Ja.
I much prefer your friend Salka and the others.
We will go back there again.
Perhaps next week?
I-I'd like that.
What did Salka mean when she said that I was young, even for you?
I'm 19, nearly 20.
I'm-I'm not that young.
No.
You're very old.
Are you a virgin?
Of course.
Got a minute, Pat?
Sorry, Bess.
Excuse me.
Uh, I think Rose may be ready to call it a night.
Oh.

You don't want to turn into a cliche, do you?
Depends on what cliche you're talking about.
He's over there.
All right, time to go to work.
Help me, Pat.
Your wife.
Rose.
Never in public, Pat.
Wasn't that our agreement?
I'll have Henry drive you home.
Do you trust me?
Do you trust me?
Sex isn't sex... unless it is a little bit dangerous.
I don't understand.
I will bind your hands and cover your eyes.
No, I want to be able to see.
Just relinquish control to me.
But I...

Fetishes are very natural things.
Oh.
But I'm not like that.
You don't know unless you try.
Just try.
Fear excites me.
Perhaps it will heighten things for you, too.
What?

What?
I don't, I don't...
I don't want that.
What?
I-I thought that y-you...
You thought I was what?
Safe?

Heroic.
Knocked off my pedestal, am I?
Heroic?
You don't know what that means.
I think I do.
I know what it's not, anyway.
You Americans think people need to be good to be great.
Goodness is nothing.
There are millions of good, useless people in the world, millions of good Germans, I promise you.
Being brave, that's what matters.
And brave people can be shits undperverts, just like me.
A million people read this in Los Angeles alone.
And that's why we're all here?
What do you want us to do about it?
Say no.
To Gyssling, to the Germans.
Or at some point, we won't be answering to our investors, we'll have to answer to history.
If we create a relief fund, it's Jew industrialists running the world.
Mm-hmm.

Either way, we're playing into the hands of the enemy.
That's a little easy, don't you think, L.B.?
You're not a Jew, Pat.
So... we're suggesting I take on Germany?
Just me, hmm?
Lose all that revenue with no thanks from you but a-a pat on the back.
Well, thanks, anyway.
And screw all of you.
History doesn't pay my salary.
On the other hand, we all... all... have stockholders that we have to answer to.
Monroe, lovely party.

I'd be happy to offer myself as your private tour guide.
We leave for Vienna tomorrow afternoon.
What, you do?
I didn't realize it.
Yes.
So, what would be the point of getting attached?
Getting attached is the only point, if you ask me.
How did it go?
Maybe no one saves anyone.
Well, that didn't take long.
Oh, Monroe wanted to talk about Germany.
Bad timing.
There's still a depression.
Didn't you have your fill of that at the party?
You know, I had the perfect moment with Mayer as we were walking out... about Margo Taft.
Left him speechless.
Tell it to Bess Burrows.
I'm not interested.
No?
You and Mayer humiliate your wives.
You fuck the women who work for you, and pretend they want you, and then cower to the Nazis.
Then you argue with each other about who's the bigger man.
Spare me.
Is that really what you think of me?
Isn't that who you are, Pat?
Excuse me.
Can I have a moment of your time?
Uh, I want to thank you for coming all this way, for your wonderful work on our movie.
You're all going home tomorrow, and I know that it's a trip back to a continent that is full of risks for some of you.
I want to offer an alternative to as many as are amenable.
It's the reason I brought you here in the first place, not because I couldn't find musicians in Los Angeles, but because I'm afraid of where Europe is heading.
I hired you so that I can help you.
Stay here with us.
Don't go back.
We'll find work for you, places to live for all of you, if you're willing.
But, Mr. Stahr, many of us have families.
I have a wife and three children, young children, in Vienna.
I know these are all difficult choices.
Perhaps they can come, too.
We'll find a way.
But if you don't?
If you cannot?
I understand.
Think about it, at least.
We only make movies, huh?
You are here late.
I had to watch the cut of a picture.
There was nothing objectionable about it, except maybe the length.
Mendelssohn was a Jew, no?
He was.
Play it again.
That passage always makes me weep.
I've had as many surprises as I can take in one week, Monroe.
What's this all about?
Is this about last night?

Just watch.

Odelle will take care of that.
Just...

Roll it, Pete.
You have to listen to me.
He's not who he says he is.
The professor and his friends, none of them are.
It's all a terrible act.
We're in danger.
We're in great danger.
Please, say you believe me.
Monroe.

I lost a job because of it.
But this time, I swear, it's all true.
The clattering sound you hear is the click of typewriter keys on paper.
This building is where Brady-American writers come to turn real life into fantasy, and fantasy...
I'm here on a condolence call for Margo.
Aw.
I don't believe you.
Well, maybe not just that.
Uh, there is a small problem.
But I'm sure that if we put our heads together...
What is it, L.B.?
Well, it turns out Louella Parsons has gotten ahold of a story...

It's a career-altering story, I would say.
From whom?
Uh, Louella never tells.
Somebody from long ago who became indiscreet after the woman died.
Is it true?
Is it true?
Don't ask her that.
Fine.
Just that Louella wants to publish.
And you know Louella.
Luckily, I have a particular relationship with her.
The one person who could convince her not to.
Thank you, L.B.
Oh, that's not how you thank me, Pat.
If you've already drafted your agreement, will you send it to my legal department?
It'll save my lawyers some trouble.
Son of a bitch.
I will expect you on the MGM lot once you've wrapped "Shyness."
Margo?
What if I just say no?
The hell with him.

Let him do what he's gonna do.
I have a better idea.
You go be the biggest star in the world.
Show 'em all.
Right.

We still have "Shyness."
We'll make a good picture with that one.
Fuck Louie Mayer.
And Louella Parsons.
Nobody can hold a candle to you.
You know what's funny about you, Pat?
Everyone in this business has two faces.
Most people, they put their best one forward and they hide their worst.
But you, you put on a gruff face... and you hide your heart.
It'll have to be our secret.
Thank you.
How many are staying?
I don't know.
No one speaks of it out loud.
How about you?
Are you staying?
Look, home isn't so safe anymore.
We all understand that.

But it is home, and this is not.
After my parents died, my nightmares were of being all alone.
Not all of us will find someone.
Being attached is the only thing that matters.
Or so I've been told.
Am I mistaken, or does it seem that there are fewer members of the orchestra now than when they first arrived?
Is that so?

Leo.

I'm getting on my bus, Georg.
Don't.
Don't get on the bus, Leo.
I'm going home.
We both know how cold it can be in Vienna.
Some time in the ocean air might do you good.
There's no rush to get home, old friend.
My life is there.
Mein ganzes leben.
Leo, you're not hearing.
I am no different from other Jews.
You just know me.
I'll see you next week.
Uh, Mr. Dummit, um...
I was wondering if maybe we could borrow just a little bit more.
There are some unexpected expenses.
Clapboard?
Photography.
Your choice.
A good client like you.

Okay.
Okay.
Who was that?
What are you doing here?
And don't say you were in the neighborhood.
No.

Is that "absolutely not a date" offer still good?
So, none of the better options panned out, huh?
Exactly.
Come in, come in.
Yeah, the, uh, place still needs a bit of work to be done, you know.
No.

You've made a home.
This is, uh, uh, my sister Darla.
This is my brother Nathan.
This is, this is Celia.
Do you like, uh, do you like bread and, uh, and soup?
I love them.
Great, okay.

Okay.
Let's see here.
Oop, I took yours.
Okay, yeah, thank you.
Dig in.
How is it?
It's really good.
It's the best meal I've ever had.
I was born around the corner from here.
We lived on Hester, until my father moved us to the Bronx.
Took him seven years to save up enough to do that.
A candle?
That's for him.
It's a thing Jewish people do for the dead.
I haven't lit one in a long time.
You've never talked about him.
Your father.
Mm.

Morris Sternberg.
The man whose name I discarded.
He made shirt collars.
He was a collar man.
We didn't have much to say to each other.
He didn't have much to say to anyone.
I don't think anything I did ever made him happy.
Why all this now?
These... these musicians and...

Margo Taft.
We've all traveled a long way to get here.
I ran away.
But home comes with you.
I'm the son of a shirtmaker.
The grandson of peasants from outside Kiev.
Still.
Always.
You asked me if I could love the tour guide.
I love Kathleen Moore.
The girl from Rathgar.
I love the you that's you wherever you go and whatever you do.
But I still want things to change for you.
That's why people come here.
It always has been.
Yeah.
That's why I came.
Oh, you've done this before.
Things were good in Vienna before they were bad, you know.
So now I am your project?
I... well, I... feel responsible.
We brought you out of the darkness of Europe, and I want this place to be... better for you.
Well, in my experience, we bring the darkness with us, Mr. Hackett.
Rose.
I'm very sorry.
Amen.
