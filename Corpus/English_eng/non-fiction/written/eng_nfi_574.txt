And the senator was forced to suspend his campaign when officials discovered it was a,
"Weekend at Bernie's" situation.

Dozens hospitalized as a serial arsonist strikes again in New York City.
We go now to our field reporter,
Kevin Herkins, who's been on top of this story from the beginning.

That's right, Chuck.
This Quiznos may be toasted, but tonight, nobody's saying "Mmm."
Witnesses saw a white male fleeing the scene.
He's described as 30s, red hair, wearing a grey suit, and a pink tie.
However, police are warning that the description is wrong and the guy probably looks the opposite to that.
There he is!
We now go live to over there!
No!
Well, I'm sure that's some sort of strange coincidence.
Kevin is a beloved member of the MMN family.
- He obviously didn't...

I set all the fires!
Redheads unite and kill all the other hair colors!
Back to you, Chuck.
There's my little star!
All my friends saw you on TV!
Oh, I'm exhausted.
I was up all night recording vocals for DJ Snake's brother, DJ Worm, and my voice is already shot from doing that TED Talk on the power of chillaxing.
Tonight, I'm serving as a celebrity referee at Susan Sarandon's ping pong nightclub.
Huh.

Are you working on any dope side projects, Chuck?
Well, actually, in June,
I am giving the commencement address at the Braithwaite School for Troubled Boys.
Wonderful news, everyone.
Kevin has been indicted for serial arson.
- Oh, my God.

We don't need someone with a ton of experience.
Basically, if they can string four words together, the job is theirs.
Me could go camera.
Katie could do it.
Ha!

Who said that?
I did.

Well, what are you doing at our morning meeting?
Do you want to do it, Katie?

No, thanks.
- Good.

Why?
You've got nothing going on.

They're all from the Domino's Pizza Tracker.
Because I would like to produce a story.
I've been working a source at the NRA, and I think he's finally willing to do an interview.
Okay.

The network has received quite a few angry phone calls from older viewers about our theme song.
Really?

Unfortunately, elderly people who complain about things are our key demographic.
We're gonna need a new theme song.
New theme song, eh?
You know, I play... guitar.
But I think you'd be great on the show!
Mom, stop following me.
I have no desire to be on camera.
I think you're just scared because of what happened last time you tried to be a star.
Katie, dance like no one's watching even though everyone is and the stakes couldn't be higher.

Boo!

Mom, I'm not scared.
I just don't want to be a field reporter, and honestly, I don't want you to go back to being an insane stage mom.
Oh, please.

If I had pushed you harder, you would've won Little Miss New Jersey and Little Miss America and that other pageant that turned out to be for dwarves.
I didn't want to do any of those.
Only because you were afraid of your own greatness.
You're not gonna make that mistake again.
Yes, I am.
Oh, so you admit that it's a mistake.
Well, case closed, Judge Joe Black.
Or is it Brown?
You know, the... black one.
Okay, Mom, Mom, I'm not doing it.
Okay.
What do you say to this?
"Believe in your dreams"?

Oh, Katie, I just don't want you to be on your deathbed and look over at me and say, "I should've gone for it, Mom."
"New theme song, eh?

Stupid.

Listen to the rock.
I'm definitely not gonna regret it, and I'm not making my life decisions based on advice from a rock!
I'm coming.
Is someone playing a prank on me?
Because it's very funny, and I definitely get it!
"Believe in your dreams"?
Thank you!
I'm writing the new theme song, and that's final.
If Frasier can do it, so can I.
For lunch, I wanted tossed salad and scrambled eggs.
It's not because of the song.
Hey, what's Greg doing?
Screen testing new field reporters.
Do you speak any English at all?
- Ja.

I can't believe you don't want to do it, Katie.
Yeah, I don't know.
I just never really wanted to be on camera.
Plus, I have this NRA piece that I think...
It's 2017.
The only people that don't want fame and attention are molesters and not even.
Josh Duggar and Jared Fogle have that new reality show
"Property Pervs." You're the only one.
- Okay, whenever you're ready.

Thank you!
So you haven't found anyone yet, huh?
No.

There's just too many news shows.
CNN had to give 10:00 to the "Damn Daniel" guy.
- Oh, this guy looks normal.

Could you do it without the dummy?
You heard him, dummy.

Could you please fill in, Katie?
- Buy me some time.

Every time I do something like this, my mom just gets way too into it.
This one time, I was in the background of a "Girls Gone Wild" video, not naked, just using a metal detector, and she bought, like, a thousand copies.
Please, Katie, for the show.
Fine.
Fine, but just temporarily.
We're back in business, baby!
What?

I've never taken it off.
Fans from around the globe will gather at this midtown hotel to celebrate the 20th anniversary of "Dunston Checks In,"
which this reporter urges all of you to check out.
In Manhattan, I'm Katie Wendelson.
Back to you, Chuck.
Back to you, Chuck!
All right, everyone, go get some dessert, and then we'll rewind and watch it for the sixth time.
Dave, open that wine you've been saving for your retirement!
You got it, dear!
Congratulations.
- Thanks, Angie.

- Ralphie asked about me?

Mom, why is that woman glaring at you?
Oh, her?

She is so jealous because you're on TV.
Her daughter's just a stupid senator.
I am so proud of you, Katie.
You made me so happy tonight!
Aw, thanks, Mom.
You know what, it wasn't even that bad.
I got my makeup done, a mean girl from middle school approved my friend request.
See, I told you this was gonna be a good thing.
Yeah, and I've never had so many people say "Good job."
You never hear that as a producer.
Sometimes, I sit on my own hand and then pat myself on the back so it feels like a stranger's doing it.
Oh.
Wait.

...with Portia Scott Griffin.
Stan, you've been at the NRA for 30 years?
What?

But I was out in the field.
I didn't write any questions.
So let's get right to it.
What is, like, the coolest gun in the world?
Oh, no.

You know, I once shot a bazooka in a Taylor Swift video.
- Is there a question?

Do you have any questions for me?
Um, what's Taylor Swift like?
- Well...

She's screwed it all up.
I lost a huge story 'cause I was doing some stupid thing to make you happy.
- Aw.

I'm never going on camera again.
- What?

Can I have a picture with the TV star?
Yes.
And tomorrow, I am marching into Greg's office, and I am telling him that this is over.
Oh, Ralphie texted back.
He said, "She wishes" and four toilet emojis.
Hey, who are you, the janitor?
Clean up these papers that someone else threw on the ground.
No, I'm the editor, Justin.
Haven't I seen you going through the garbage?
No.

The garbage?

Cool guitar.
That's her way of saying thank you.
Okay, well, see ya.
I'm actually writing a new theme song for the show.
It's going really well.
- Cool.

It's going horribly!
It's not fair.
People only see me as one thing, a serious newsman, but I'm so much more!
I'm a musician!
I'm a painter.
I'm a dirty standup.

- I'm an X-rated hypnotist.

Portia gets all these opportunities to be creative.
She was the news anchor in two different "Batmans" but not me.
Finally, I get my opportunity to write a song to show a different side of myself to the world, and I'm blowing it!
Wow, Chuck, I didn't know you were that into music.
Well, you know how the old saying goes,
"All news anchors want to be rock stars and all rock stars want to be news anchors."
You know, I'm actually in a band myself.
Okay, well, see ya.
No, what I meant was I can help you write the song,
- if you want.

You know what, you're all right, janitor.
Greg, that was my NRA interview.
Good morning.
How could you let Portia do it alone?
That's like letting a baby shoot a gun, which happened at the end of the interview.
- You were out in the field.

I officially quit being a field reporter.
No, you don't.

- They loved you.

They wanted you to take over the position permanently.
Why?

Yeah, I have no idea why.

- Because what?

Greg, come on.
You know me, I don't care how hot I look on camera.
Never said "hot."
I'm sorry, but unless you start a fire and join the Redhead Army, which Kevin is somehow mobilizing from prison, you are the new field reporter.
- Stupid slamming bod.

Sorry I'm late.
Last night was the release party for my new young adult novel.
- Cool.

Like, a elf or something.
Sounds like you're pretty busy, Portia.
But so have I!
Chuck's been up for 36 hours.
I managed to put a little something together for the new theme song, so why don't you take a listen?
I don't think we're gonna get many complaints on this one.
You may fire when ready.

4 minutes and 35 seconds.
Wow, it felt much longer than that.
Well, what do you think?
Yeah, it's just our current theme song is six seconds long.
I think we're looking for something a bit more, like do-do, ba-ba-dum-bum-bum.
Ooh, that's not bad.
Of course.

You should probably just hire a musician to do it.
I'm just a newsman.
Excuse me, everyone.
Damn you, rock!

Are you... magic?
See, honey?

You keep trying to limit yourself, and the universe just won't let you.
- Yeah, I guess so.

What's wrong with how I say "woda"?
- Ohh...

They're wearing you.
Yeah, and we need to get you a new catchphrase.
"Back to you, Chuck" is getting a little stale.
How about... ooh, "We have the meats!"
Isn't that an Arby's slogan?
I thought of that independently.
Okay, there you are.
Why am I getting nervous?

Oh, don't you be nervous.
You are amazing, sweetie.
That's why all those people called in about you.
- Wait, what people?

Who told you that?
Greg said he didn't know why the network wanted me.
- Oh, Greg's boss told me.

What's his name, Mom?
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt...

Liar, liar, capris on fire!
Okay, fine!

Me and everyone in the viewing party.
Angie and Barb and Pat and that two-faced B-word, Judy.
She wants to be my friend now!
But why would the network listen to you?
Well, you know what Greg said.
Old complainers are "The Breakdown's key demographic".
Hey, we are live in 90 seconds.
Oh, my God, Mom, you are unbelievable.
- I know.

I'm not doing my report.

What?

You are not gonna quit!

There'll be a hundred calls, a thousand calls.
You don't know how many women I know with endless free time on their hands.
How do you think Curly Sue won "The Voice"?
It was us!
Anyway, break a leg, pumpkin!
I knew this would happen if I went on camera.
You are like a drug addict, Mom.
Only, your drug is imagining me playing charades with Jane Lynch on "Hollywood Game Night."
Oh, so what?

This is just like when I did pageants,
- and you wouldn't let me quit.

That's why I had to pretend to forget "The Hotstepper."
Yeah, that's right.
I could've done "The Hotstepper" that day.
I could do it right now.
- That is not true!

We'll talk about this after your report.
Good luck!

Wayne, why are you panning to Carol?

My dreams.
Hey, Mom, do you think it's possible that being on camera is your dream?
Me?

I really think I'm too old for that.
Mom, you got a job in cable news with no experience at age 60.
Who says this dream is out of reach?
I don't know, Katie.

Oh, yeah?
Well, what do you say to this?
"Believe in your dreams."
Oh, Katie.
Can we please go?

No, no.

You can still be a producer.

No, no.
