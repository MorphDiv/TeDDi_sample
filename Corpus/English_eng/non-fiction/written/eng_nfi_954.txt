[man and woman speaking Turkish]
[in Turkish] Thank you, Kadir.
[in English] Excellent.
Please tell your wife she makes it even better than they did in Constantinople.
I think you mean Istanbul, ma'am.
Constantinople, this is its ancient name.
Of course.
[tires screech]
[door opens]
The Black Sky.
We have it.
[sighs heavily]
[elevator thuds]
[Sowande] How long have you waited for this?
Too long.
[Sowande] This will use the last of our resources.
Are you sure it is a risk worth taking?
I have never been more sure of anything.
[inaudible]
[gasps and screams]
[breathing heavily] [groans]
[grunting softly]
I know you're afraid, but that will pass.
So will the pain.
- [whimpering] - [shushing] It's all right.
It's all right.
[grunts]
- Stand down.

This is your home now.
We are your family.
I have waited so long to meet you.
[grunting] [groaning]
[grunting]
[screaming] [shushing]
[Elektra straining]
Easy.
Easy, my child.

Easy. [shushing]
Go ahead.
You'll need your strength.
Language will come back to you.
So will your instincts.
But everything else...
I'm afraid it wasn't worth keeping anyway.
[Elektra] You... [sighing] You...
My name is Alexandra.
You were born.
You lived and died.
And what you saw on the other side... the darkness, the absence of everything... it's horrifying, isn't it?
I have seen it, too.
More than once.
And all I want in this life is never to see it again.
But now that we've been brought together... that's not something we need to worry about.
Who?
[stammers] Who?
My child... you... are everything.
You are everything.
It doesn't matter what you choose.
You are the Black Sky.
In the end, you are the weapon.
Wakizashi.
Good choice.
They won't know what's coming till it's too late.
[grunting] [man grunting] [breathing heavily]
[grunting]
[both grunting]
[groans]
[all grunting]
[all grunting]
[bone cracks] [man groaning]
She's ready.
- [all grunting] - [blades clashing]
Bring it to her.
You asked me a question.
This is the answer.
This is who you are.
[theme music playing]
[door opens]
[Sowande] She's ready for you.
The war that you've been fighting your entire life, Stick, it's over.
Long as Iron Fist lives, nothing's over.
Where is he?
Damned if I know.
We're not doing the torture song and dance.
Not anymore.
Shame.
I grew to like that part.
Danny Rand has been running around off the grid for months.
He thinks he's a one-man army.
He's a real handful.
I've seen better.
Still, you'll spend the rest of your days looking over your shoulder.
And from what I hear... [chuckles] those days are numbered.
[Stick grunts] [chuckles] Now...
- that's the Alexandra I know.

You make a new friend?
[Alexandra] No, Stick.

[sniffs] [breathing heavily]
- Elektra.

Only the Black Sky lives.
[Stick] Listen to me, kid.

- We gotta get you out...

I'll die before I let him join your army.
You think I want him to fight for me?
He's a weapon.

After a lifetime of serving K'un-Lun... you don't even know what he is.
No.
But I know what I am.
You asked for it...

[all grunting]
You'll die here tonight, old man.
- Finally.

[groans] [all grunting]
[panting]
[Alexandra] Son of a bitch.
- Are you a public defender?

- Then what are you doing here?

- Let me guess, Jeri Hogarth.

I didn't know she did diversity hires.
[chuckles] Uh, I'm independent.

- Well, I'm not paying you.

- Oh, 'cause she'll foot the bill?

And I'm a Catholic.

[chuckles]
- That was a bad joke.

Uh, Ms. Jones, may I ask how long you've been a PI?
No.
Are you always this rude to people trying to help you?
You know what?

Okay.

After talking to the lead detective outside, it appears that despite the mess you got yourself into, the NYPD doesn't actually have anything to hold you on, so...
- So I can walk?

Though your apartment and office are still considered an active crime scene.
You'll need to make yourself available for follow-up questions,
- so in the meantime...

Yeah, I know the drill.
Ms. Jones, can...

Look, there's no easy way to say this.
I read your file.

What you can do.
I know what happened with Kilgrave, so if...
- This has nothing to do with that.

Look, I'm...

What part of "I know the drill" did you not understand?
Nothing happened.
I'm good.
Great.

Malcolm?

Are you okay?

[Claire] Hey.
- What happened?

The kids are being recruited by some guy known on the streets as White Hat.
I don't know what he's up to, but they're doing some kind of clean-up work.
- Cleaning up what?

What's wrong?
[sighs] That kid, Cole... cops just picked him up.
- He's probably in jail by now.

- I left him behind, Claire.

No, it's not.
You're better off not in prison.
I like you here.
- [grunts]

I got clocked.
- By White Hat?

But when he hit me, it felt like a sledgehammer.
He had this... this hand.
I think it glowed.
Glowed how?
I don't know.

- He had this fist and...

- Who you calling?

- He punched me.

Seriously?
- How come he can't be hurt?

- I earned it.

[stammers] He earned it.
There's this mystical place called K'un-Lun, and it's...
I can answer myself.
- There's a mystical place called K'un-Lun.

My parents died in a plane crash.
I was adopted by a group of monks.
There, I learned how to summon my chi.
I'm the Immortal Iron Fist.
Is this why you went to China?
Whatever it is that you saw last night, this White Hat guy... could be connected to the people Danny and Colleen have been fighting.
The same people who attacked the hospital that Claire was working at.
You're saying you know who this White Hat guy is?
No.

It's a criminal organization.
No telling how old they are.
[Colleen] Nor how much influence they have.

In everything.
All of their power stems from their ability to bring back the dead.
Okay, I don't know how much of this I can take.
- This sounds insane.

The two of you trust me, so please listen when I say... you're on the same side.
Now, we're gonna leave you two alone, and you're gonna talk.
Talk.
[Danny clears throat]
[Michelle] Couple months ago, we were planning a vacation.
He wanted to get away.
Doesn't make sense.
I came to you... for answers.

Well, the NYPD is on the case, but...
[Michelle sniffles] ...between us, I would like to keep investigating.
- You mean without the police?

[Michelle sighs]
- I don't know how much I can afford.

Okay.

Now, is there anything you haven't told me?
[Michelle sighs]
Drugs?

- that he was a part of?

Why?

I think someone was targeting him.
What do you mean?
I'm not sure.
[sighs and sniffles] None of this sounds like John.
He wasn't this kind of person.
And there's nothing I'm not telling you.

He loved two things.

And that's it.

[knocking on door] [sniffles and sighs] I'll be right back.
[sighs]
[door opens]
- [woman] Hi, sweetie.

[indistinct chatter] [woman] I'm sure we'll find out soon.
Why don't we lay you down, and you can let me fix you supper.
Hey.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Um... tell your mom I let myself out.
[door opens] [door closes]
[indistinct chatter]
[footsteps echoing in distance]
[indistinct chatter]
[Matt grunting]
[cell phone vibrating]
Hello?
[woman] Hi, I'm returning a call from Ms. Anna Asher.
- What?

Oh, right, this is her.

- Um, can you come in this afternoon?

211 10th Avenue, suite 305.
- 305.

- You can fight.

- You can take a punch.

Claire said they did experiments on you.
Long story. [sighs]
What kind?
Was it voluntary?
They made me this way.
That's all you need to know.
What did you mean, "chi"?
[chuckles]
It's a...

- Okay.

- Not like that.

I trained for years.
There was a test.
There was a dragon.
[laughing]
No, there wasn't.
[Colleen chuckles] It's going better than I thought it would.
[Danny] I know how it sounds, but it's true.
You gotta admit, that dragon shit, from the outside...
- does sound pretty crazy.

[both chuckle]
You really think they can help each other out?
[clicks tongue] I don't know.
Once they're done with the pissing contest...
- [chuckles] - ...who knows?
- [sighs] - [Luke] Claire says you're a good guy.
I'm trying.
She says you've done a lot for Harlem.
Yeah, I just... just wanna help.
Me, too.
That's what led me to that warehouse.
You call that helping?

[scoffs] Come on.

It sure looked like it.
The Hand is dangerous.
They murdered my parents.

That kid's got nothing to do with all that.
Of course he does.

- He needed a job.

You never fought someone to protect someone else?
- Of course I have.

The difference is I live on their block.
The difference is I'm not some billionaire white boy who takes justice into his own hands and slams a black kid against the wall because of his personal vendetta.
Claire told me about you on the way over here.
Not all the mystical parts, but everything else.
The money?
That doesn't define me.
Maybe not, but that kid is sitting in a jail cell tonight and you're not.
- Neither are you.

But I've seen my share of injustice.
The guy in the white hat, he's just the beginning.
You're not thinking about the bigger picture.
You're not thinking about anything but yourself.
Hey!

I know enough.
And I know privilege when I see it.
You may think you earned your strength, but you had power the day you were born.
Before the dragons.

You have the ability to change the world without getting anybody hurt.
These people won't be stopped that way.
You're taking the war to the ones at the bottom, is that it?
If I were in your shoes, I'd think twice about using that thing on people who are trying to feed their families.
This isn't gonna work out, it's obvious.
Good luck, man.
I'm sorry.
[Danny sighs]
I know you're having a rough time in here.
Yeah.
Misty says you'll be arraigned within 24 hours... but we can figure this out.
Has anyone approached you about making a deal?
I know a lawyer.
There ain't no deal.

Looks like you were doing grunt work.
Like you were helping to clean up.
- Look, it doesn't matter.

[scoffs] You don't take the blame for something that's not yours.
- Whoever hired you...

They're watching everything.
They got eyes and ears all over.
And the longer you talk to me, the worse it looks.
For the both of us.
- Who's the guy in the white hat?

He is next-level dangerous.
- So am I. - [scoffs]
Is this the Hand?
You wanna help me?
My mom, she lives at 555 Edgecombe.
Take her some lotto tickets.
Tell her they're from me.
Cole, just tell me what you know.
Scratch-off.

Tell her that they're from me.

- You can trust me.

Tell her I'm sorry.
[Colleen sighs]
Looks like that big guy made quite an impression, huh?
I am glad that you two didn't end up in a fist fight.
'Cause I'm not sure that this place would survive it.
[chuckles softly]
What if he's right?
About what?
The Fist is one way to win this war, but I do have others.
Yeah... and you've tried 'em.
They're the Hand, you can't just buy 'em.
I'm not talking about money.
I have connections, access.
He doesn't understand what we're really up against.
He doesn't get how dangerous they are.
I know, but... why am I fighting street-level operatives when I have the power to go right to the top?
Because, Danny, you...
You're not a businessman.
I know.
But my father was.
I know, but you are a fighter.
A warrior.
That's what you know.

And a good warrior uses every tool at his disposal.
I own 51% of a major corporation.
I've got to try this another way.
Hello?

[indistinct chatter]
[woman] Welcome back, Mr. Rand.
Mr. Meachum mentioned you had business to take care of abroad.
Uh, yeah.

On a business trip himself.
Perhaps we could schedule something for next month?
I, uh, don't have time for that.
Well, unfortunately, that's the earliest he'll be available.
There was an organization that did business with us last year.
- We did lots of business. [chuckles]

- You need help spelling that?

I know you're scared, but we can't leave until you help us.
- Help you how?

We tracked 'em to SÃ£o Paulo.

They set up shell companies, worldwide.
We think they're doing something here in New York.
[Danny] We need you to help us find it.
- SÃ£o Paulo, Berlin and Moscow?

Anywhere else?
- Uh, Paris, Miami...

I'm cross-referencing short-term holdings through those cities.
Two hundred exist in the overlap.

What does that mean?
Not much, except that they were shut down on the same day.
Before they closed, they all made deposits into one place here in New York.
I just need a name.
Um...

I remember that name.
Ward gave us a list of places to cease doing business with.
[Colleen] It must be the Hand.
I'll get you the address from the directory.
Thank you.
- [sighs]

No.
There's another way to attack.
And I gotta do this alone.
- Gorgeous, isn't it?

Like all of our projects, it was built with sustainability in mind.
- Yeah, I am super into that.

Now, why don't you tell me what you envisioned for your company's...
- Communal workspace.

Um, I mean, we're gonna need a juice bar.
- Of course.

You know those bouncy balls that people sit on that some people find annoying?
I think it should be modern and high-tech, but also so simple.
A pragmatic utopia.
Yes.

Don't answer.

[chuckles] Here is a property I worked on last year in Midtown.
Huh.
Is there anything more recent?
- I'm sorry?

- Not that I've done.

How about any other architect in your firm?
Just because it's really important for our brand that we're not only on the cutting edge, but we are the cutting edge.
Yes, but... can you keep a secret?
I am the face of discretion.
[takes deep breath] I can show you our most recent work.
A building in Hell's Kitchen, designed by my colleague John Raymond.
- Wow.

And is that architect on the premises?

No, he's... not.

And who were the clients?
That's privileged information.

Uh, but I do have another structure that you might be interested in.
One that we unveiled in Soho last winter.
- If you just give me a minute?

[knocking on door]
Hi.
We met the other night.
Oh, we didn't meet, son.
God himself sent you.
You don't have to hide anything from me.
I know where Cole is.
He's following in his brother's footsteps.
[Dolores sighs]
You know what kind of trouble they were into?
No.
But I hear there are bodies.
Don't sound like my son, but I've been wrong before.
I can't help but feel some shame, to be honest.
But ain't nothing I can do now.
Except to pray.
I believe in the power of prayer.
My father made sure of it.
But it might not be too late.
Cole was working for some bad people.
I'm going to stop 'em.
May the Lord bless and keep you for doing his work.
- Only doing what's needed.

You know, you're the opposite from my son.
He can't admit when he's done something wrong.
You can't admit when you done something right.
Uh, Cole wanted me to bring these to you.
They're lotto tickets.
He said he wanted you to know he was thinking about you.
[chuckles] There is goodness in that boy.
You know, he'd been bringin' me these since he was eight years old?
At first, I didn't know how he was paying for them.
And then I realized he was using his lunch money.
[both chuckle]
He said it was worth it...

How 'bout some cookies?

Did he tell you I keep them?
There's a... a box in there, but it's too high up for me.
Cole's always the one who does it.
[phone ringing]
Hello?
Yes, this is she.
What do you mean, some kind of accident?
Oh.
They say he was in his cell when it happened.
My... my baby.

Oh, God, my baby!
Oh, my babies!
All my...

All my babies is gone!
[thudding]
[man grunting]
[panting] Where's the Fist?
[grunts]
- [man] Name, please.

- Here to see?

- Are they expecting you?

Right this way.
My name is Danny Rand.
Last year, you illegally transferred
$243 million worth of assets through my family's company.
And you thought you got away with it.
But I know who you are.
You killed my parents, attacked my home.
You're the Hand.

[Alexandra] Mr. Rand.
I appreciate your candor.

And I must say, considering what I've heard about you, you seem much more disciplined than I anticipated.
- [Danny] And who are you?

But, please, go on.
You were telling us what you were going to do.
[sighs]
- Murdock!

If you grab me like that again, I'll punch you so hard, you'll see.
- I've been here before.

- And you're in serious danger.

This case you took, it's leading you toward something truly sinister.
Okay, you are the most full of shit lawyer I've ever met, and I think we should appreciate the magnitude of that statement.
- Let's talk about this somewhere else.

Unless you wanna tell me how a blind man moves the way you do.
- Excuse me?

[Jessica grunts]
Rand Enterprises has put together a case to take you down.
Extortion, narcotics, human trafficking...
There's no end to what we'll uncover.
And?
[scoffs] And you can't hide anymore.
- Does it look like we're hiding?

Behind corporate shells, or street-level criminals who don't know who they're working for.

It's what you do.
But I'm here to expose you.
I am the Immortal Iron Fist, weapon of K'un-Lun.
- And I'm fulfilling my destiny.

How is it these days?
You're gonna lose everything.

You haven't lost everything, Mr. Rand.
Not yet.
- [gun cocks] - [inhales sharply] [breathing heavily]
[both grunting] [silenced gunshot]
- What are you doing?

- Where?

- How do you know that?

This is exactly what I was trying to avoid.

I've crossed paths with Iron Fists before, but this is different, because this time...
I won't kill you.
No use using her for protection.
They will rip right through her to get to you.
[all grunting]
Come on!
- [Danny] You?

[grunting]
- So punching's okay now?

It's complicated.
[grunting]
[grunting]
[elevator bell chimes]
You look like an asshole.
It's your scarf.
[grunts]
[both grunting]
- [Luke] Jessica?

- [Luke] How you been?

[Danny] We have to get out of here.
- Who's he?

[Matt] Wait.

Something else.
[sighs] You know what to do.
- [Matt] What is it?

- [Luke] Who's that?

Uh-oh!
[all grunting]
[man yells]
Ah!
[grunting]
Ah!
[Matt grunting and panting]
Elektra?
- [Danny grunts] - [Elektra groans]
[Matt panting]
Come on.
Who are you people?
[elevator bell chimes]
