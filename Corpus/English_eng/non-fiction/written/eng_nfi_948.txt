Pearl, finish your cereal and get these shoes...
- Look out!

- Honey, what is this?

The dogs love this drone!
What are you wearing this weekend?

It's black tie optional but just wear a suit.
What wedding?
Rich Colgan, my friend from college.
I can't.

- Daddy, bad words!

I wish you would have told me earlier.
I was looking forward to going together, you know?
- Mommy, I can go.

We were having a nice weekend.

I know.

Crash landing!

Look at that thing burn.

- Got to go to work.

- Tag is the coolest person we know.

- That's a 60-foot wave.

When he gets here, don't man-pressure him so hard, okay?

- Because when you're uncool, I'm uncool.

Tag!
It's good to see you, bro!

- Oh yeah.

- Wow!

- It was awesome.

- Have you been?

- Marianne, you look banging.

You know, this guy comes here a couple of times a year, the least I can do is put on a little makeup.
I'd come a lot more, but with her packed schedule, it's tough.
We make it work.
That's so sweet.

Oh, that's...
Hey, guys, are you going to Rich's wedding on Saturday?
We're going to a wedding?

- Well, I didn't RSVP, but yes.

Marianne, you have to RSVP.

I didn't RSVP to your guys' wedding.

But I am so excited!
And this is going to be a good one.
The only thing better than a wedding is a second wedding.
It's going to be a train wreck.
- Why do you make that assumption?

- She looks sweet.

She can't help her face.

This is what I do.

It's like Judge Judy but I'm living on someone's couch.
- You know who else is gonna be there?

- I've heard Fun Ethan's gonna be there.

- Yeah.

This motherfucker right here.
Fun Ethan!
Fun Ethan!
Judge Lisa!

Judge Lisa!

Y'all ready for this?
No-one wants that.
Wanna see my bedroom since I redid the bedroom?
- Yeah.

You fully farted.
Hey!
- Maxibon!

- How are you, mate?

I just want you to know Fun Ethan is in the house tonight.
Fun Ethan is here!
- Get prepared.

I wish this guy was on the wine tour.
Yeah, you would've left him for dead in the vineyard.
- I'm sorry.

Felix and I were on the road to breaking up for a long time.
And I might meet someone tonight.

- Yeah.

Take that, Felix!
Take that!
- Hi, guys.

Sexy lady!
Thank you!

So that's great.
Fun Ethan is here.
Fun Ethan actually farted a little earlier.
- Should we...

Yes, let's get in this bitch.
- So what's up?

Yeah, that's because Fun Ethan can't be scheduled, you know what I'm saying?
Look at this place.

- 18.

- 18.

18.
No, Marianne, you're not 18 because you didn't RSVP, so you're actually not on our table, or any table, I don't think.
Is that Paul Dobkin?
- Yeah.

- Sam's ex-boyfriend from college.

They only hooked up three times junior year.
Wow.

It just popped in there, like...
Anyway...
Anyway, I wonder what he's up to these days.
He's an ER trauma surgeon.
Really?

How do you know that?

He operated on my finger.
And he did a magnificent job.
That finger is bang on.
Wasn't Paul's nickname in college "Party Dog"?
- Oh, yeah.

- Hold on, that's Party Dog?

That dog was fun.
But not more fun than Fun Ethan because this party's gonna be off the hook!
- Oh, my God!

So you guys still travel in a pack?
Party Dog!

No-one has called me Party Dog for years.
Is that human years or dog years?
Now it's a party!
I actually, I don't really like being called Party Dog anymore at all.
I don't party.

Got it.
- Sorry.

- I apologize on behalf of these idiots.

- Good to see you.

- Thank you so much.

There's something on the back of it.

- Party Dog!

- I'm not sober.

- I drink heavily.

Hey, I know it's hard to be alone at a wedding, so you can be my date tonight.
I'm fine.

Is that something Rich wants you to do?
No, but I'm sure it's an open mic thing, right?
I don't think so.
I think it's more of a don't give an extemporaneous speech kind of thing.
Once I get started, they'll be glad.
I give great toasts, guys.

I don't know.

Don't worry about me.

I don't think it's such a good idea.
Besides, being alone at a wedding sucks, right?
And this toast bullshit is gonna distract me, so just...

- Cool.

- Cool.

I'm gonna say, "So, I hear 50% of all marriages end in divorce."
Maybe you should add a twist where you then say a funny thing.
- No, I think just leave it at that.

Are you really gonna do that?
- Yeah.

Who cares?

They'll find somewhere else to sit.
No, this is where they would...
- Table 18.

Nope.
I think we're in their...
Shush!
No names.
- I think it's that side.

Yes, we're the Turners.

We're in our seats.

We're in our correct seats.
- You're Max.

- So that's weird.

It is.

Awkward.

- We'll keep looking.

Well, guys, Fun Ethan is about to get this table some drinks!
- Yes!

There's gonna be a lot.

- What's this?

- Are you a Communist?

Alright, here we go.

Dial it back, babe.
It's not...
- I'm sorry.

It's so funny.

No, I'm sorry.
Time to get served up.
Time to get served up.

- Time to get served up.

- Hey.

I'm great.

Where's Jen?
She couldn't make it on account of the fact that we are divorced now.
- Oh, wow.

It's okay.

She wanted to come to this wedding and I fought to take custody of it because I was hoping you would be here.
- You're kidding!

- I'm so happy to see you!

As I was driving here, I was thinking, "I bet Sam will look gorgeous."
- Sorry if I keep saying that.

- You're double fisting?

- There you go, okay?

Supposed to help me with the drinks.
- Hello, fun table!

- Hi!

- Hi.

Where's Lisa.

Your captain is back and he's here with shots!
- Howie Wexler.

- My wife, Anka.

To the fun table!
- Fun table!

- Bottoms up!

- What's in this?

- Straight gin.

- Wow, we don't do this in Australia.

Yeah, it sucked.
Okay, now they're gonna do Charlie's Angels.
Wow.

I feel bad.
I support women.
We need to band together now more than ever.
It just seems like you're very intent on ripping this wedding a new asshole.
Rich cheated on his wife.
- So?

He hated her.

It was a miserable situation.

Well, then, get divorced and then sleep with someone else.
I mean, this isn't a wedding, this is a celebration of cheating.
I don't know.

- What?

I think then, you know, it makes it more exciting.
It's, like, less... dull and lame.
The sex is spicier.
- That is the dumbest thing I've heard.

- From you.

So, did you all go to school in Boston?
Yes, we did.
Well, we did, as well.
Anka and I plan events for the Harvard Alumni Association in the area.
We're gonna go dance and leave this.
- Yeah.

You know what might be up your alley?
Our upcoming Jazz Brunch with the Harvard Black Alumni Society.
- Jazz.

Yeah.

- Tell them.

I gotta go work on this.
- Do you really?

I think politics is good to talk about in a way.
You can't write it here?
This is my jam!
We're never at the fun table!
Would you guys excuse me for one second?
It was nice meeting you.
I actually pissed on the fire hydrant.
Hey, Sam.

Ethan, I've been meaning to tell you,
I've read all your books and they're incredible, I love them.
I'm really impressed.
Thank you very much.

- What are you working on now?

It's about werewolves.

I would never have guessed that.

Yeah, there's actually a lot of metaphorical aspects about werewolves that I find extremely interesting.
Yeah?

Like...
I'm...

- You'll get it.

Ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is time for the Party Dog to eat!
I've got to go!
I'm so sorry.

Check this out.
- Yeah.

Check this out!
Yeah, Party Dog!
- Champagne for the toast?

Hey, everybody, to Rich and to Ashley!
May their marriage be a smashing success!
Do not walk here.

- Broken glass.

- You're bleeding really bad.

He's cut.

I've always wanted to do that.

It's cool.

- Now I'm never going to.

- Do you always bring a case with you?

- Everywhere you go?

I'd wear a stethoscope and a white lab coat everywhere if I could.
Really?

If you wear a uniform, women wanna fuck you more.
Come on, that's not really true.
That's not really true, is it?
100% true.
- Really?

When the dog was a married dog, the dog just hung out with other married dogs.
But now the dog's a single dog and the single dog has learned a lot about the single dog's life.
One of the things I learned, and it's a fact, if you're in a uniform, women wanna fuck you more.
- I see.

You dress like a sailor, fireman, you know, soldier, airplane pilot, doctor, professional athlete.
- You go out dressed like that...

You will be fucking.
So, basically, anything that you would have dressed up as as a kid?
- Yeah, kinda.

- Well, ninjas fuck.

But if you, a literary academic, were just out there in the world as a single person and you did not dress like an astronaut or a ninja, you're never gonna get laid, as a single guy.
You're not single so don't worry about this shit.
But what if I was walking around wearing a tweed jacket and a turtleneck?
Then you'd be wearing a tweed jacket.

No, that's my uniform.
It's not a uniform if you choose to wear it.
Every college professor who dresses like that, it's not a uniform.
That's just, like, lack of fashion imagination.
- I don't know what the fuck that is.

Why do you all have elbow pads?
- I don't know.

So instead of a traditional speech, we decided to do something a little bit different.
- This is for you, Ashley.

So over the top.
I can't thank Rich enough... for helping me through a very dark time.
I won't go into it, but I hurt a lot of people, both... figuratively and literally, and when that thing happened, lives were changed forever.
And Ashley, I just hope that you can be there for Rich when he needs you the most.
The way that he was there for me when that thing happened.
And those of you who are wondering what it is I'm talking about...
What happened?
You might be asking other people who know.
For those of you who do know what I'm talking about, don't tell anyone.
Respect my privacy, thank you.
When Rich and Amanda broke up, we should acknowledge that a lot of his friends turned their back on him.
I went to his niece's bat mitzvahs and he was iced very hard.
But if you were willing to go through that for love, then it must be something real.
Aww.
Now, I know you all know me as the Party Dog, the dog, that big dog!
Party Dog!
It's the Party Dog!
Seriously, now is not the time for that.
This is not about the dog.

The man I am proud to call my best friend.
Good evening.
My name is Max.
I am a former roommate of Rich's, but surprisingly, not a member of the wedding party.
I can't believe you didn't ask me to be a groomsman!
Or at least tell me why.
But I think this does give me some insight into Rich's politics.
Don't ask, don't tell.
No politics.
No politics, alright.

Let me just go right to the room.
The room!
Can we get a hand for the room, because it's beautiful.
Is this spectacular or what out here?
It kind of makes you wonder what Rich's third wedding is gonna look like.
I'm gonna be a groomsman at that one!
Rich, what can I say, Rich?
That's your name... and it also is your most redeeming quality.
Oh, shit!

This beautiful woman, is she marrying you for your looks?
As a gay man, I think I can safely say she is not.
Shit!
This table...
I love that table.
Party Dog's in the house!

Party Dog!
And the bridesmaids, look at those bridesmaids!
They're so fucking hot!
You look so beautiful.
And you're so tanned!
I mean, 50 Shades Of Grey, more like 50 shades of orange, am I right?
I guess orange is the new bridesmaids.
Orange is the new bridesmaids?
Bridesmaids isn't a color.
This is terrible, but I'm just so happy for him!
- That's all I have time for tonight.

I'm at table 18 if you want more.
Good night!
Please don't drop the mic, it's super expensive.
- Max, that was so good!

- Somebody killed it.

- Unbelievable!

I stand corrected.
I went in confident but I had no idea it would be like that.

Orange is the new bridesmaids?

- It just came to me.

It just came out like vomit.

I gotta get out!
Hey, everybody, check this out!
Fun Ethan!
Hey, get off the cube.

Get up on this cube!
Get up on that cube!
Get up on that cube!

Get up on that cube!
Not the cake!
- Oh, fuck me.

Oh, my God.
Yo, yo, yo.
Can I talk to you a sec?
Sure, yeah.
- What do you know about Sam?

- I haven't seen her in a long time.

I don't know.

Yeah, I mean, are they solid, you know?
Because me and her are vibing, kind of hitting it off.
Maybe she wants a piece of the Party Dog.
Listen, Sam is married and she's not gonna leave her husband for some horny surgeon, okay?
You're pretty worked up about this.
You wanted to know the situation, I'm telling you.

She's not...
- What?

- I do not have a crush on Sam.

You're getting pretty worked up about this.
You know what?

- I'm doing what?

- I am?

- Party Dog is acting like a...

You're acting like a baby that could ride on my fucking back.
- You hungry?

- Do you need a nap?

Let me try to cheer you up a bit.
Peek-a-boo!
That's not funny.
- I got you.

Why are you being so annoying?
- Don't.

- I don't know what that means.

- The dog gonna do what the dog gonna do.

Well, the dog will get consent, then the dog will do what the dog gonna do.
That's clunky.
Who ain't gonna give consent to the dog?
Excuse me for just one moment.

Hi, Fun Ethan.
- Are you having fun?

Would you mind grabbing our coats and just stepping outside for a second?
You gotta be kidding me.
You're not a professional dancer?
You're not a professional flirter?
Part-time.
No, I'm an online lifestyle guru.
- Oh, that's cool.

- Where are you going?

- Here, I've got some.

Wow.

- A little bit.

She shouldn't smoke.
I just posted an article about it and it's really bad for your skin.
Yeah, or your lungs.
Actually, that has been debunked.
You ruined my night.
Whoa.

Fun Ethan was abandoned by his friends and stranded with Howie and Anka and had to watch you throw yourself at your ex-boyfriend.
Jesus Christ.
I'm sorry, if you wanted to make me jealous, you did it.

You're jealous?

What?
You never showed up at the hotel.

Especially after your whole "I really need you right now" sob story you gave me at the vineyard.
Is that what this is all about?
It was crazy with Lisa and the IVF.
- You knew that.

- You texted and said you weren't going!

Whatever.
I came here to have a good time and not to sit there and watch you just fawn over Dr. Horn Dog Party Dog.
How do you think I feel?

I'm not flirting with her to rile you up!
- Forget me and go dance with your wife.

What are we, in seventh grade?
I acquired a taste for those gin shots of yours.
Did you?

We are in the alumni directory.
Maybe the four of us can get dinner at the club some time.
That's a great idea, bub.
- We're not...

- She's your wife?

She is my wife, yes.
Well, Ethan, whichever one's your wife, she should join us.
This is definitely my wife.

- Good night.

Alright, good night.
Boy, they were drunk.
Really into Harvard.
Does anyone want a drink?
No, thanks.
- I'm good.

Uhm...

Nothing.
Samantha wanted to... wanted to talk to me about... about her... about her ex-boyfriend.
It looked like you were having an argument or something.
No, we weren't.
She wanted to hear a male perspective on a particular issue.
- Yeah, which issue?

It's stupid.

I'm gonna finish this.
- Are you becoming a smoker again?

It's just you have another cigarette ready and waiting in your ear.
I forgot about that one.
- Alright, so I'll see you in there.

Right?
- Hey.

How's your night going?
Oh, it's not great.

Really?
Alright, they haven't played enough Black Eyed Peas, but that's my only complaint.
Your Party Dog gave a terrible speech.
You mean the toast Paul did?

I don't know.

Yeah, I guess it was sweet in the sense that it forced us all to celebrate two people who got what they wanted at someone else's expense.
Well, maybe Rich married the wrong person the first time around.
It happens.
I'm Jon's second wife, remember?
I do, yeah.
Look, life is short.
You gotta go for what you want or you're gonna end up regretting it.
Even if it means that you hurt some people.
So you're saying that I should be happy for Rich because he went for it when he cheated on his wife?
Rich is 40, and God bless him, now he can spend the second half of his life with a chick he's crazy about instead of someone he grew apart from.
It makes sense that you'd take Rich's side.
I'm not taking sides.
I'm just saying it's not always black and white.
Are you seriously giving me a fucking lecture?
It felt like you just gave me one.
You know, the thing about weddings is that if you're not in the mood, they're the worst place in the world.
I have to go to the bathroom.
- I'll miss you.

Can you guys believe how good this wedding was?
Didn't I say it would all work out?
When I get married, I want it to be exactly like this, just surrounded by all my old friends.
- You wanna get married?

I mean, I don't know if Marianne shares that view, but...
I'd like to.
Well, the important thing is that you guys make each other happy.
- Marriage is just a label.

You see, I think that it's more than that.
You know, Tag, life is short.
You should go for what you want or you're gonna regret it.
She's right.
Marriage is the best thing that's ever happened to me.
This is terrifying.
I'm gonna do it.

There she is.
Don't say anything.
- Hey, baby.

To Rich and Ashley.
- To Rich and Ashley.

What happened?
What was the traumatic thing that happened?
You'll never know.
And then I made this joke about the bridesmaids that was a little risky but it just brought the house down.
It just killed.

I just killed it.
Um...
I just miss you, Felix.
Sorry.

Hey, look at this.
I should probably take this to the dry cleaner.
Marry?

I don't even know.

Lisa gave me this whole beautiful speech about seizing the moment.
You know?
- How did it go again?

You know how I feel about marriage.

Most people have that opinion in college and then they grow out of it.
Stop trying to make me you, okay?
I've chosen this life and I like it!
You two need to find a new place now.
You're crowding me and you're crowding the bunny.
You know what?

- Yeah, that's probably for the best.

I'm sorry.
Wipe out.
