Oh, that's fresh, dude.

Seriously, you're gonna bring that up again?

Jerry...

- Everything is "Jerry" out of you mouth.

Ch-Charlie, I need a new keg.
- This one's tapped, buddy.

Like, if Jerry jumped off a bridge would you jump off it, too?
- Which bridge?

- Which bridge, really?

Guys, guys, please stop arguing, okay?

I want to take advantage of it.
Look, can you just tell him to get rid of Jerry first?
I'm sorry, I don't even know who that is.
- My tapeworm.

- Yeah, he got a worm.

And you named it?
- Jerry.

Yeah, okay, great.

Can we not talk about worms or sewers or rats today, with all these people in here?

- Charlie, new keg.

But, yeah, fine, what do you want... you want me to put pink ink in the beer or something,
- make it all inky and pink?

I don't want to do Valentine's Day shit, okay?
I don't want to do that.

So, can we not remind them of that with inky beer?
All right, fine.

And then we'll go back to the way things were.
- Who?

- The worm?

It's an intestinal parasite, incapable of complex thought.
You just described my ex-husband.
- Oh...

- Yeah, he's a...

That's pretty funny.
- Hey, Dee!

Dee!

Dee is in the house, uh, Dee is in the house,
- uh, Dee is in the house.

- Thanks for the chant, guys.

- Her?

- Yeah.

Oh, well, she's like a new regular.

You know, trying to make her feel more at home.
- It's a nickname, short for Dottie.

Nah, we already started calling her Dee and it kind of stuck.
You know, can't really change it now.

That's my nickname, bitch.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

- You bitch!

Don't-don't yell at the customers, okay?
Look, we got a good thing going here, all right?
We got a bunch of new customers in here.
We got a regular, we might get more regulars.
- Let's not screw this up.

- I've got news, I've got glorious news.

Mac!

Mac is in the house, Mac is in the house.
Thanks for the chant, guys.

There is an unopened crate out there.
- An un... an unopened crate?

- Hey, there's a crate!

- We got a crate.

- We have a crate.

- What, what?

- What?

We got a bar full of customers here.
So what?

Um, I can put a fan next to the yuck puddle,
- and the smell's gonna clear everybody out.

I don't want to clear everybody out.

- in some dumb crate?

It's about the mystery of what's inside the crate
- that gets us.

- Yeah.

- Not the straw?

- Whatever's in the crate, like...

- Yeah, it's worth a look.

It's trash.

This is what I'm saying.

We're always running outside, out into the world, looking for riches and treasures when we've got everything we need right here.
Oh, you're saying we do, like, a booze for money type scheme.
That's good.

- Oh.

Whoever invented the idea of a bar.
Which is what we decided to do years ago when we bought this goddamn place.

You know, and talk about worms?
Right?

Can we just do the one thing we've never tried?
Can we just do our jobs?
'89, good.
Damn drunks.
Rum and Coke, tequila soda.
Pay me.
All right, that's gonna be five.
Out of 20.
Yup.
Aw, she wants another mojito.
Looks like our regular's got herself a usual.
You bet.
Yo.

Can we go check out that crate now?
What?

Shit, how'd you know?
Because the bar's still open.
You're not done till we close.
Hey, what do you say you and me go out the back and check out that crate.

No one else has to know.

It's not on my mind, okay?

Can you go check their IDs so we don't get another underage drinking situation on our hands?
- Just got my mind on that crate.

- get your mind on your job.

- Done with my work.

Frank, you're not done
- until the end of the day.

How about you don't cook the books so we can actually tell
- how the business is doing?

It's crazy.

Oh, the soda gun's clogged.
Dude, can you go clear the lines for me?
Trick Charlie into doing it.
Well, I want you to do it.
I can't trick Charlie.
Charlie's pretending to ignore me because he's jealous of Jerry.
I-I don't want you to trick Charlie.
- I want you to clear the lines.

- Break time.

Lunch.
I'm craving salty, but Jerry likes sweet.
What are you doing?

- This is sweet.

Frank, you're an animal.
He won't stop eating,
- yet he's just wasting away.

I mean, can you believe them?
You know, I can't even play Night Crawlers with him anymore 'cause he doesn't want to offend Jerry.
I'm gonna stop you there, Charlie, because
I've exhausted my daily quota of worm talk and worm-related issues.
- What are you doing?

- Don't reach your hands in there!

Jesus Christ...

Are they clogged?
Yeah.
- Just trick Dee into it.

See, this is the problem.

So, can you please go do it?

Yeah, maybe.
All right, let me see if I can trick Mac into it first.
Don't trick anybody, just do it...

I need two shots of whiskey.
Two shots of whiskey.

Finally, somebody's actually working.
You know what, I appreciate that, Dee.
- I appreciate you.

No, no, no, no, no.
- That was a big one.

Yeah, that's what this is.

Did Charlie ask you to trick me?
Trick you?

The soda gun is clogged, I cannot make drinks.
I don't know.

You know, I made him a valentine...
He hasn't given me shit yet in return.
Why the hell did you do that?

I know, but we used to, and it was fun, you know?

It wasn't a goof.

I'll give it to you, though...

A-A little bit nasty?
One of you put anthrax in the box.
Or do you not remember the anthrax scare?
Oh, ho, I remember the anthrax scare.
To many, 9/18 was the delivery world's 9/11.
That's a good point.

- Stop it!

- Hey-oh!

- Cricket!

- Cricket!

- No, dude, you do you!

You do you!
- You do you!

We don't judge, Cricket, we don't judge.
What are you doing?

- Cricket.

Yeah, Cricket.

We can't go around encouraging homeless men to smoke PCP in our restrooms, you know, trying to trick each other into doing our jobs and getting fired up at the-the mere mention of a crate.
- Oh, but it's just such a mystery, isn't it?

- Cool crate.

Yeah, yeah, it really isn't though.

It's trash that somebody left behind.
Hey, but if it's mystery you want, you know, what about the mystery of the yuck puddle?
What the hell is that thing, you know?

Why won't it harden?
It shifts.

He's seen it shift.

So why don't you and Mac go solve that goddamn mystery by cleaning it up, you know?
And, oh, what about the mystery of the clogged soda gun, you know?

Well, that's-that's not such a mystery.
And we could probably trick Cricket into doing it.
Oh, why don't we just trick...
Cricket doesn't work here though.
- But that's free labor.

- That's kind of better.

You're not... you're not getting...
Hey, just do your jobs!
Just do your jobs.
Why isn't it getting any smaller?
Can I be honest, dude?

Oh, that must be what all the bubbling's about, 'cause it's, like, trying to communicate.
It definitely feeds.

- So it wants to live.

So Dennis has sent us in here to do the impossible.
Absolutely.

Like, there's got to be something in this whole "do your job" angle.
'Cause that doesn't sound like Dennis to me,
- you know what I mean?

He's acting, like, so weird, especially towards me.
I think it's because I'm gay and he's, like,
- totally uncomfortable with it.

Well, no, 'cause he's known that forever, so it's, you know...
Well, he may have suspected it before, but there's no way he could have known for sure.

But, look, either way, he's been acting very distant towards me, and I feel like he sent me in here to punish me or something, because, I agree, the whole, like, "do your job" angle
- just seems, like, totally out of the blue, and, like...

- Like...

What?
Charlie, he doesn't want us to work at all.
- He doesn't?

He doesn't want us to mop up the yuck puddle.
- He wants us to "mop up the yuck puddle."

Of emotions.
Of what?
- It's a metaphor.

He wants us to talk through our personal issues and be more open with our feelings because it's Valentine's Day.
Oh!

- Go with me here, dude.

Valentine's Day is an entire day dedicated to feelings,
- something that Dennis doesn't have.

And so that's why he hates Valentine's Day so much.
But he's entrusted me, because I'm a gay man
- and clearly more sensitive than the rest of you,

- to break down those walls.

- All right, cool.

- Okay.

Uh, uh, Frank's gonna leave me for Jerry, man.
Oh, uh, I was talking.

I guess we'll, um...

You know he's only doing this to get a rise out of you, right?
- Oh, that's so Jerry.

We're talking about Frank, okay?
If you just pretend to like the worm, then he'll probably just get rid of it.
Oh, shit.

I know so, buddy.
- Nice, man.

- Yeah, that just gave me a great idea.

- Thanks, Mac.

You're not gonna let me talk?

So, uh, you're gay, huh?
For pay or for free?
Uh, for free, I guess.
Chump.
It's taking forever.
- Ugh.

I'm not sucking on the other end.

No, thanks.

Since when does he care how the bar does?
I don't know.

I can't get a read on him these days.

- Rage-filled, rape-y.

- Yeah, yeah.

I mean, what is that?
Unless...
Oh, my God.
Dennis doesn't want us to work the bar.
- He doesn't?

He wants us to work on ourselves.
What the shit are you talking about?
Just go with me here.

Dennis wants us to work through our personal issues so we can enjoy Valentine's Day again.
- I got it.

I'm so mad at Charlie, because I made him a valentine, and, you know what, he didn't even really...
I gave myself Jerry on purpose.
Well, I was right in the middle of a sentence, but... what?
I gave myself the tapeworm.
- Well, that is the most disgusting thing I've...

No, I don't.

I bought poop on the dark Web and stuffed it up my butt to lose weight.
- Jesus Christ.

- Well, it took about four ounces of it.

That's enough!

With the tip of a teaspoon.
- Okay...

Stop answering questions I'm not asking, okay?
- I'm done, I'm done.

- and clench my sphincter.

Charlie, I'm mad,
- and I think we need to clear the lines.

- Uh, just-just trick somebody else into it.

Wh-What are you doing?
I'm trying to write a valentine.

Oh.

Uh, okay.

- Didn't mean to interrupt.

I also got you a box of chocolates, so...
Right.
Oh, oh!

- Yeah.

- What?

Are you making a valentine for Frank's tapeworm?
Well, not if I can't think of a word that rhymes with "Jerry."
- You son of a bitch.

- I can't believe you don't know!

Oh, and literally everything rhymes with "Jerry," okay?
Scary, hairy, Mother Mary, quite contrary.
Woozy, woozy.

- Ho.

- I wanted to give you a valentine.

Right in front of me?
- You did?

- Charlie.

- these are just for Jerry.

- Charlie.

- Oh, that's so sweet.

- Thank...

- You shouldn't have.

Listen to me, I got these for him, all right?
- So no.

- I got these.

- Oh, guess what, I bought these for him.

You fool!
- It's so good, Charlie.

You wouldn't.
Oh, but I would, Frank.
You see, I knew you'd never take the pills willingly.
But Jerry...
Jerry likes sweet, doesn't he?
You poisoned me.
No.

At worst, you're properly medicated.
You son of a bitch.
- Charlie.

I'm poisoned.
Poisoned!

What are you doing?
- We've been poisoned.

No, no, no, nobody's been poisoned.
- They're just...

- Uh, there is no...

And there are no-no worms.
- Nobody has worms.

Don't leave.

Guys, what are you doing?
Take this discussion someplace else.
No, I'm good because I've had a great Valentine's Day.
Bye-bye, Jerry.
Are you serious?

You son of a bitch, Charlie.

- What are you talking about?

I'm not gonna let some worm beat me on Valentine's Day.
- Don't talk about...

I...

What?
I gave myself Jerry on purpose.
Why would you do that?
To slim down for you.
Why would you...

Because I overheard you on the phone saying,
"He got flabby."
No, no, no, buddy.

I sa...

- Take it outside.

- smell like crab, Frank.

Okay?

You-you didn't think I was too fat?
Well, no, you were fat as shit, pal, but I loved you that way, Frank.
Fat and crabby.
So, you want to try and get this dead worm out of me?
I would love to pull that dead worm out of you.
Yeah?

Stop, stop!

- Huh?

- Getting the worm.

Don't do that.

Now, by the grace of God, we somehow still have Dottie here so, please, don't scare her away.
Sorry, Dottie.
- Who's ready to die, bitches?

- Whoa!

What are you doing with the Valentine's box?
- Put that down.

I know exactly what I'm doing.
Okay, okay, fine.

- I am busting out the anthrax.

- And I'm out.

No, you don't have to go.
- Oh, goddamn it!

I'm getting a goddamn valentine right goddamn now, or so help me God...
I will end us all.
No, don't.

- I will...

Okay, fine, Dee.

I'm gonna sing you a song.
Okay?

All right?

- Fine.

Uh... a Dee song.
- Nothing rhymes with Dee.

Everything rhymes with Dee.
- I mean, literally, everything rhymes...

Okay, fine.

Okay, j-j-just relax.

♪ You're sweeter than a bee... tle ♪
- Just say bee.

Right?

Uh... ♪ You're the honey that the bee... makes ♪
♪ You're the... ♪
♪ Sugar on the pound... carrot ♪
What's a pound carrot?
Go with pound cake.
♪ Cake!

♪ You make ♪
♪ Life sweet for...

♪ A-and I... ♪
♪ Love... you. ♪
Thanks, Charlie.
You can't rhyme very well, but...
That was... that was really... really pathetic.
What?
I wrote a couple words on a construction paper, pink and red, and you sing a heart song for me?

You made me do it!
Yeah!

- Ew!

Look, that song was derivative of a song I wrote
- for the waitress, anyway, then.

Frank, grab that anthrax!
Grab it!

Hey!

Stop!

What are you...

All right, this is nuts!

I mean, I-I-I can't believe we blew another opportunity to have a working bar.
To have a successful business together!
Because you assholes get so worked up over Valentine's Day, the dumbest holiday that ever existed!
But I thought you were trying to get us to focus on ourselves and focus on Valentine's Day.
What?

Are-are you insane?

I...

But you just couldn't do it!
Dennis, I got to say, I feel like this is just about something else.
It's...

- The bar is fine.

- This is... something else is up.

You know what it is?
- This is 'cause you hate Valentine's Day.

I hate Valentine's Day.
- It's because I-I just want...

- He's trying to distract us from Valentine's Day.

- That's it.

- Yeah, you know why, though, you guys?

It's because he doesn't have any feelings and we do.
Yeah, because we have feelings and you don't, and that's why you hate Valentine's Day.
Oh, stop!

I hate Valentine's Day because you assholes never got me anything!
Okay, and I have feelings!
Of course I have feelings!
I have big feelings, okay?

A-and it hurts.
Okay, so... so... that's why I hate Valentine's Day, and that's why I put anthrax in the box.
That was you?
Yes, it was me.
I just...
I just wanted it to stop.
Okay?

- Oh, he's already eating it.

Dennis.
What?

I got the crate.
So what?

Open it.
I'm not gonna open a goddamn crate, Mac!
There's nothing in it!
Just open it.
You want me to open the crate?

If it'll get you to stop focusing on it and get you to stop focusing on this goddamn Valentine's Day bullshit.
I don't know why you're so excited about this goddamn thing.
There's never anything insi...
What is this?
It's a gift.
I got it for you.
For me?
Yeah.
You, uh...
You got this for me?
I ordered it off the dark Web.
I wanted it to be a surprise.
Yeah.
And how did you, um...
How did you know that I wanted an RPG?
'Cause I know you, man.
Also, you casually mention RPGs, like, a weird amount.
- Is this true?

- You were talking about rocket launchers today,

- I think, yeah.

This is, uh... this is cool.
I still think Valentine's Day is a bullshit holiday, but, um this is nice.
Want to shoot it?
Yes.
Where's the rocket?
Yeah, that should be, uh... shit, I... there's no rocket.
- No rocket in there?

Ah, there's no rocket!
They forgot to put the rocket in there!
Dude, I'm so sorry!
Mac, I don't care.
I love it.
You figured out the one thing I wanted more than anything else in the entire world and you got it for me.
And it's perfect.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Yeah.
Charlie, let's go get this worm out of my ass.
- Let's do it, man.
