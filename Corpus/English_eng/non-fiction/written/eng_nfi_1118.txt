I can't outrun this forever.

Okay.

It's just, I-I look in the mirror,

'Cause someday you're gonna have to tell your kids this when they're old enough.

Nobody wants to go to church.

God and all that stuff, none of it means anything, okay?
I tried it all after Andi-Rae died and when your mom got sick.
I mean, I did crazy things to try to make her better.

No, you got to go to church.

I'd actually heard that.

Thank you.
We should get a drink sometime, catch up.

I'm not...

Um, it's, um, it's kind of a bad time for us.
Ledda's been real sick, and, uh, it's just a bad time all around.
It's just a drink, Wade.

He were in fine fiddle yesterday, hunting frogs,

Hey, there's nothing to be frightened about.
I know every cure on this mountain.
All you have to do is let me take a look at you.
Can you do that?
That looks nasty.

Thank you for coming to the council.
As you know, the coal company have poisoned our fields.
Sweet Allis Spring, too.
Those snakes intend to starve us off the mountain.
I've checked the cisterns, and if we ration, we should have enough to get by.
As for our crops, we're gonna have to clear new fields and get some cold weather plants in the ground.
It's gonna be a tough six months,
- but we're gonna make it.

Sounds like mighty cold soup to me.
I hadn't finished yet.

It's their job to get us off the mountain, but they're doing it from their buildings and their helicopters... they never see the real cost.
So I think we get one of them up here, show them the harm they've caused and make them face us.
The one in charge.
They ain't gonna come willingly.
I know.

BIG FOSTER:

Bren'in.
Alone.

- if things go belly-up.

- It'll bring the law back for sure.

But anything could, and this clan cannot wait to see
- what they're gonna do next.

Hasil knows her.
He showed Phil'up a wad of paper once, said it was money from
- the lady in charge.

I'll take the drop, I'll get around them guards,
I'll find Hasil, and I'll go get that she-wolf.
- Drop's a perilous route.

Okay.
All right.
(Barbara giggling)
BARBARA:

- You lost, old man?

- Sure looks like it.

Yes, you did.
The way I heard it, when I was born, my mother was bleeding out...

Off warming Callie Shay's bed, that right?
Your ma and I, we already lost one child 'fore you.
When her labor pains began, I drank a jug of Farrell Wine, I run off.
You really want to be a fool like me?
You made it look so damn appealing,
I thought I'd try it on for size.
Elon would not recognize you like this.
Well... then it's a damn good thing that you got him killed.
Elon... forgave me.
I hope you find what you're looking for.
Hey, Fa.
- I found it.

SALLY-ANN:

- It's not in the budget.

You said this place is your favorite.
Now, I want you to just sit down and don't worry about a thing.

Nobody. (clears throat)
Now, that looks... that toast thing looks delicious.
What do you call that?
So you really aren't gonna tell me, are you?
Tell you what?
Tried to convince myself that all this disguise stuff was about fight club.
You know, it being illegal and all, but... that man just recognized you, and you were fine with it.
So you're hiding for a different reason.
'Cause you had something to do
- with that prison break, didn't you?

I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't do that.

- All right, yeah, I did.

We need to go right now, because if some guy in a restaurant can just recognize you, then it is just a matter of time before a cop does.

Sit down.

We ain't going nowhere.

We gonna hide for the rest of our lives?
We need to keep moving forward the best we can.
That is, if you still want to be with me after everything that I've done.
You guys know what you want?

HOUGHTON:

- Hey, Hilda.

Caleb, go upstairs, get changed.
Then you can go outside.
Jesus, Ledda, what are you doing?
- You're supposed to be in bed.

What are you talking about?

Well, a-a little boy from the street.
Uh-huh.

No.
I think it was Breece, but as a child.
He was on the porch and we talked.
Don't look at me like that.

Yeah.
Sounds like you ate a whole bunch of Percocets, is what it sounds like.
Yeah, you'd know all about that, wouldn't you?
Sorry.
I know that it was him.
Look!

HOUGHTON:

- Yeah.

That I'm nuts.
And maybe I am.
But he came back to comfort me, Wade.
He doesn't want me to be scared.
Okay.

Well, I'm calling regarding an e-mail sent to us anonymously this morning
- regarding your company.

It's between Don Foushee and the governor confirming that One Planet would give him a sizeable campaign contribution contingent upon the hiring of Matt Meyers.
Well, I can tell you with absolute certainty
I have no knowledge of any such e-mail.
Really?

- Care to comment?

No comment.
Well, it ain't gonna taste like honey mead, but this is the strongest medicine I got for Silas.
- Is that white oak bark ready?

Thank you.
You should take a rest.
- Been at it all morning.

Don't be pigheaded, Bren'in.
Doesn't help anyone.
Especially not the baby.
Does everyone know?
Don't imagine so.
Been hiding it real well.

Well, I guess that makes two of us, then.
Oh, you are funny, yes, you are.

No, we're not going anywhere with you.

You may not be, but he is.

It's all right.

BIG FOSTER:

Taking that woman seems ill-advised.
I mean, it's-it's dangerous right now.
Exactly.
You want me to deliver that message to Silas Shay?
Maybe his mother.
Well?
Look... we need you, Hasil Farrell.
SALLY-ANN:

I want him gone.
- Okay.

I'm handling this.
- All right?

When is all of this craziness gonna stop?
We have been going from one crisis to the next, and now you are talking about kidnapping somebody!
Ain't no harm gonna come to that woman.
Just... (stammers) ain't no harm gonna come to her.
I need to help, Sally-Ann.
All right?

BIG FOSTER:

I see what it is.
Come on.
No, you don't.

Listen to me.

All right, but there are too many people who do not want my kin to exist, and I will not stop fighting that.
Stop what you're doing and look at me.
I will always come back to you.
But you got to understand that this is the way that my life is gonna be, and you need to choose with honest eyes.
Then you need to choose my complicated life, too.
'Cause you are not the only one who has to make hard choices.
- I know that...

Can we get a move on?
I'll be back for you.
(door closes)
This is utterly ridiculous, making you come in on a weekend for this farce.
There's no way I'm the source of that e-mail leak.
Our diagnostics show otherwise.
That e-mail definitely originated from your account.
Well, that is impossible.
(chuckles):

I was a bridesmaid at Don Foushee's wedding, for God's sake.
Did anyone have access to your computer other than yourself, Ms. Grimes?
No, I take cyber-security extremely seriously.
Did you bring your laptop?
Again, no one had access to this machine other than yourself, correct?
No.
Of course not.

Thank you.

Nurse says the doctor will be in about ten minutes.
He said that ten minutes ago.

I know you do, but, Ledda, you got to get another CAT scan.
You don't have to have any treatment;

- make arrangements.

Ledda, I'm not saying right now.
I'm saying... in time.
Goddamn.
Hey, Hilda told me about Dana Miller.
- Said she was real cute.

- She said you were flirting.

- Yeah.

- I was flirting with her?

What made her say that?
She said that you, uh, smiled twice and that you laughed once.
I was just being polite.
Oh, is that it?
Well... she did, uh, give me her card.
- You gonna take advantage of that?

With everything that's going on?
Wade, pretty soon, you're gonna be a single man with three children.
What a catch, huh?
Yeah, that's my point.

Well, he unwell?
No, I don't think so.
He's just...
- he's busy.

Uh, mm, Barb-Barbara...
Right.

All respect, uh, Bren'in, uh, he did just get out of prison.
Oh, and you think that's an excuse to abandon his family in their greatest time of need?
I guess not.
- You can go.

Hey.
- Hey.

That depends.
You haven't returned my calls all day.
- Why'd you ask me here?

I don't suspect you of leaking that e-mail.
(sighs) Thank God.
You know, I've been thinking about it.
- Mm.

It was probably in some coffee shop with Wi-Fi.

Can I get a pinot noir if you got it, merlot if you don't.
Other people might think you had something to do with it, but I don't want you worrying about me.
- Other people?

Trust me, Matt, if I knew that, I'd buy this whole bar a round.
You don't think anybody in Mountain Witness?
Uh, an escalation from the parade?
No, I don't think so.
- Have you seen their Web site?

- Makes Craigslist look flashy.

No, I don't think they have the skill set.
Mm, true.

I wonder who might be sympathetic to their cause.
I have no idea.

Although, you did backdate Breece Dobbs's paperwork so Ledda could get health insurance.
That seems a bit sympathetic, don't you think?
It's called having a heart, Matt.
Thanks for letting me know I'm being watched.
Oh, you don't have to do that.
Oh, I do.
My daddy always said, if you're gonna drink with the enemy, make damn sure you're the one who's paying.
I gave up motherhood and my marriage for this company, and I will crawl over glass before I let a man like you play games with me.

Well, you-you certainly aren't. (laughs)
Well, it's better that way.
At least I know you're not an alcoholic.
Yeah.
You know, I have to say, I was,
I was really surprised that you called.
Oh, yeah, my-my sister thought it'd be a good idea.
Hmm.

(laughs) Oh, but either way,
I have been going stir-crazy up at that house, so it's really nice to see a familiar face.
I'm surprised that you, uh, recognized me.
How could I not?
You have the same eyes.
We all have the same eyes, don't we?
You always this good at taking a compliment?
- Yeah, pretty much.

Yeah, I know.
You know what else I remember?
I remember when you were a little boy telling me that you were gonna be a policeman.
Look at you now, the sheriff.
Seems like you're doing real well for yourself.
Yeah, I mean, it might look that way.
You know, uh, I mean, I...

I mean, I think when you're young, you know, you have these ideas, you know, like, you got plans about what you want to do, then you realize that life is really just
playing the hand that you were dealt.
Like, you know, you remember how my-my dad died?
Yeah, I remember.
And right after that, my mom died.
And then, you know, my wife died.
My brother... my brother-in-law died.
Now my sister's dying.
I'm so sorry, Wade.

You really think you can live in two worlds?
Well, I have to if I want to see Sally-Ann.
Well, she's a little something, but don't tell me there ain't five Farrell women just as ready to step out with you.
Maybe so, but ain't none of 'em gonna have my baby.
I want this kid to know both his parents, so I got to dress the part.
I can't believe it.

Or convince them that kidnapping a coal devil, bringing him up here, that's a great idea.
Okay, well, what in your humble opinion, Foster, would be a good idea?
Nothing.
There ain't no point in fighting.
People down there, they got guns that they ain't afraid to use.
They got ways of getting in your head and twisting up your insides.
