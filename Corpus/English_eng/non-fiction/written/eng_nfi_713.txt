[Hiccup] This changes everything.
Hmm.

Of course it's a good turnout, Hiccup.

[clamoring]
Look at that!
All of Berk has come out to admire the Jorgensons' handiwork!
Nah.

Nobody comes to these things to admire anything.
[clears throat]
In every Viking's life, there comes a time when you have to take a chance.
-Risk everything.

Today, we celebrate a man who took the initiative.

Spitelout Jorgenson, of the great Jorgensons!
-[all cheering]

Spitelout, Spitelout, oy, oy, oy!
[laughing]
Yes!
-[all cheering]

Drink it in, friends.
We finally showed 'em all what it means to be a Jorgenson!
Hey!

Look at 'em.

Workin' every angle.

That's the only reason we have this storehouse.
Dad, I think they're just having fun.
Oh, fun?

They're kissin' their way up the ladder.
Thor only knows what they're sayin' about you.
-Look at him over there.

He's ridiculous!

Look at that.

What kind of name is that anyway?
Snotlout.
-[scoffs] Snotlout?

I wouldn't trust her to sharpen my axe.
Or that Fishlegs, he and Hiccup are as thick as thieves.
And those devious twins.

-[Tuffnut grunting] -[all laughing]
Right in there!
You wanna be like your old man?
A great leader takes what's rightfully his.
And if he doesn't, he'll be left in the dust.
Do ya understand what I'm trying to tell ya?
[whimpering]
Snotlout?
[Hiccup and Astrid laughing]
[Hiccup] Who's he kidding, huh?
-He's ridiculous.

Do you know who I am?
[screams] [whimpering]
I used to be a Dragon Rider.
[Astrid] Snotlout?
[sighs] Poor little Snotlout.
He had such promise.
Ugh.

-Ew!

Look there, Sister.

[chuckles] No, I'd rather polish our golden sheep.
Onward, Sir Barf and Sir Belch!
And try and splash a little bit of dirt in Snotlout's face.
Goodbye, peasant.
[coughs]
I always thought you'd become the leader of the Dragon Riders, but you never had what it took.

A-Gustav!

-[laughs] -[gasps]
No.
[Hiccup] All right, gang, stay sharp.
There's been a lot of Hunter activity in this area.
Maybe we should spread out, cover more ground.
Yeah, good idea.
Whoa.

[chuckles] When did that happen?
Uh, guys?
If Astrid's making all the decisions, we want to build a second story on our crib, you know?

Why do they get a better hut?
Nobody's getting a better hut!
And Astrid is not making all the decisions.
-Guys!

Hunter ships, dead ahead.
All right, spread out into formation.

I vote to attack!
No, Snotlout!

Release!
[whimpering]
[Tuffnut] Incoming!
-[all screaming] -[Fishlegs] There we go!
[grunts] Is everyone okay?
Could be worse.
[Ruffnut] Speak for yourself.
-[groans]

Here you go.

Whoo!

By almost getting your team killed?
Totally uncool.
[Ruffnut] So not cool!
Opposite of cool.
-[Ruffnut groans] Little help?

Okay, fine, maybe it was a little messy.
But everybody, let's face it, I'm the reason we won.
That's not exactly what happened, Snotlout.
[Astrid] You were supposed to cover our wing, blasting arrows, while we made a pass.

[snarls angrily]
[Fishlegs] And Meatlug was lining up a perfectly good blast when you came out of nowhere to take the shot.
-[grunts] Out of my way!

Snotlout!

-Oh, Thor!

[both screaming]
Hey, it's not my fault, I had to cover for you guys.
Snotlout, we almost lost the battle because of you.
It's called "initiative," Fishface.

-You could have ruined something again!

All right.

Snotlout, why don't you gather up all the Dragon Root arrows, take them as far away as possible and burn them.
We don't want the dragons anywhere near them.
What?

Fine.
[snorts]
[screeches]
I know.

But right now, I'm much more concerned with the Hunters' supply of Dragon Root.
They've obviously increased production.
And we're running low on antidote.
Well, hopefully, this'll help.
I pulled this chart off a ship.
Might lead us to the source of the Dragon Root.
[snorts]
Hurry up, Hookfang.

[snorts]
Forge, cliff, what's the difference?
Come on, man.

-You can do this.

Harder, right there.
-[sighs] -[Ruffnut] Careful.
Ah.

Epic marathon.

Any luck with the chart you pulled from the Hunters?
Yeah, I have a good idea what chain of islands they're coming from.
Toothless and I will do some recon tomorrow and search for the Dragon Root.
Wait.

I thought you invited him.
Uh, I thought the twins invited him.
We thought Astrid invited him.
I never invite him.
The Edge is under attack!

[all grunting] [all exclaim]
[Snotlout] It's called a "drill"!

I was seeing how'd you all react in crisis.
And you all failed!

Well, Hiccup, obviously, there are followers then, and there are leaders.

Did you find anything on the chart?

Snotlout!

Then, you play a prank that could have hurt someone.
Listen, Hiccup.

What?

I'm not gonna end up a beggar in the streets, eating dust and watching Ruff and Tuff polish their golden sheep.
I'm just as good, if not better than the other guys.
I want to lead the Dragon Riders when Stoick makes you chief.
Okay, but Snotlout, you can't just force your way into a leadership position.
It doesn't work that way.

Uh, you need to prove you can be trusted, like Heather.
And you need to be thoughtful and strategic, like Fishlegs.
Do you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

We Jorgensons don't ask permission to be great.
[rustling]
There they are.
-[gasps]

[whispering] Shh.

Oh, right.

Because we're practicing stealth and infiltration.
If those dragons don't know we're here, Hunters never will.
Battle tactics.

[heavy footsteps] [shushes]
-Yeah, Hookfang!

All right, if we can just- [screaming] -[growling] [grunts]
-Don't fight it!

-[laughs] Nailed it.

You mean, you destroyed it.
The exercise isn't about surprising one, Snotlout.
It's about tricking all of them.
[snarling]
-[screams] -[snarls in panic]
[Hiccup] Now, there are some Hunter ships down there, bud, but I don't see any...
Wait a minute.
They have a ton of arrows, but where's all the Dragon Root?
[Hiccup] Hmm.
Nice try, Viggo.
[growls]
Heather.

Nothing.

I just see you're heading towards my hut.

Don't get excited.

She loaned you her axe?
She sleeps with that thing under her pillow.
That's what friends do.
Man, nobody loans me anything. [chuckles]
Well, maybe because nobody trusts you to bring stuff back.
-[growls]

-Snotlout.

I've ever borrowed from you guys.
Hurray!
Hey!

And wait a second, this is my favorite crate!
Fluffers!

Hey, you say "stole," I say "borrowed." [chuckles] You guys trust me now, right?
Gimme that!
Trust is like a delicate bird with feathers of silk.
And yours is dead.
-[exclaims in surprise] -[snorts]
So, should we give back the stuff we stole from him?
-Nah, our bird's dead, too.

[gasps]
Someone ripped out all my flowers.

[snoring]
Oh, don't over-water it, girl.
Fishy!

-Playing in the dirt again, I see.

Me?
You know anything about my missing flowers?
Nope.

Oh, I did see Heather with some flowers earlier.
Suspicious?
Now, I have to replant the whole area.

I could... help... you.
[scoffs, chuckles]
You want to help me fix my garden?

I'm just trying to be, you know, more thoughtful and strategic.
Truthfully, I've always respected your work, Fishlegs, and I really like... plants.
Oh, well, in that case, let's get started.
Your two basic types are ornamentals and edibles.
[chuckles] You don't want to mix those up, believe me.
Then you have your floriculture--
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it, okay.

Oh, no, no, no, no.

This type of topiary only grows in the sun.
You see, some plants like sun, some like shade, some like partial sun, some like partial shade.
Oh, my Thor!

They don't talk.
Hey.

Yeah, can your mystical garden bring them back to life?
[growls]
[Fishlegs] Snotlout!
-He totally ruined my training exercise.

And let us not forget, he almost got us killed.
We're mainly here to watch the drama unfold.
You have to do something, Hiccup.
Look, Snotlout is clearly going through something right now, and we need to be there for him.

We're a team.

[sighs] Hiccup's right, guys.

Just so we're clear, the tides have turned.
There's not gonna be any banishing of anyone?
No banishments, Tuff.
[Ruffnut] I should have stayed in bed.
[scoffs] I should have stayed under that bed.
Okay.

But we have a mission to destroy the Dragon Root.
How are you gonna snap him out of this?
[Hiccup] Now, Viggo's growing the Dragon Root in these fields, underneath camouflaged tarps.

And this is their stockpile.

Sounds complicated.
If by "complicated" you mean "impossible,"
and if by "impossible" you mean "not possible,"
then I-

[chuckles lightly] Nothing's impossible.

We're gonna do a practice run, here at the Edge, just to make sure we're perfect.
And Snotlout's gonna lead the mission.
Me?

Yes, you.

[Snotlout] Um.
All right.

So, that means you have to pick who drops the barrel of Monstrous Nightmare gel on the arrow stockpile.
It has to be a precise drop, so Toothless can blast it.
-Please!

-MNG!

[both groan in disappointment]
-MNG!

Do I not look sure?
Are you positive about this?
He needs a confidence boost.

-Yeah, but Hiccup--

I'll be right there in case something happens.
-[Snotlout grunting] -[snarls] [exclaims]
-[snorts] -[inhales] [snorts]
All right, Riders.

Fishfa...

Hiccup and Toothless, get in position to blast the barrels and burn the fields!
[Astrid] Spineshot!

[Ruffnut] Woo-hoo-hoo!
[screaming] [growls]
All right, bud.

Can't mess this up, Hooky.

-[snorts in approval] -[groans] [inhales and exhales]
-What's wrong with Snotlout?

Straighten out, Hookfang.

We cannot mess this up.
He had such promise.
[grunts]
He's all over the place.
[panting]
I always hoped you'd become the leader of the Dragon Riders, but you never had what it took.

Drop it.

[snarling] [speaking in Spitelout's voice] You wanna be like your old man?
-[gasps]

Drop it now, Hookfang!
Look out!
[snarls] [explodes]
[snarls wearily]
So, how's Snotlout?
Not good.

He's grounded himself, indefinitely.
[birds chirping]
[wind whistling]
Might as well get used to sleeping in the dirt.
[snorts]
Knock it off, Hookfang.
-[grunts] -[snorts]
Stop it.

[growls angrily] [grunts]
[shouts] I said I'm not going, and there's nothing you can do that will change my mind.
-[growls] -[screams]
It's not happening.
And get used to the fact that we're beggars.
And stay away from Gustav.

Enough with the act, Hookfang.

[groans] Ow!
Oh, my Thor.

Ha, look at that.

Guess you guys like to grow in the sun.
Wait a second.
If Dragon Root grows in the sun, then the Hunters must be hiding something else underneath those camouflaged tarps.
[shouts] Hookfang!
Dragon Riders!

[hunters grunting]
Diamond formation, gang.

Fishlegs, ready the barrel.
-Ready.

All right, bud.

Loose!
[Heather grunting]
Focus on the catapults.
Right with you, Astrid.
[screaming]
[Ruffnut] Hit the gas!
[whizzing]
-[hunters whimpering] -[Tuffnut] Yeah!
[screaming]
Do it, Sparky!
Spark it, Belch!

[screaming]
Wait for it.
Wait for it.
Now!
Hit it, bud!
[hunters screaming]
Nice shootin', Toothless.
Now, let's roast some Dragon Root and go home.
Steady.

[catapult clangs]
Snotlout?
It's a trap!
Evasive action!
[Astrid] Circle back around!
[hunter grunts]
Wait, Snotlout!
[exclaiming]
Now, we can mow the field.
Follow me.

[Ruffnut] You got it!
We'll flank 'em.
[grunts] [screaming]
Watch it, bud.
[hunters screaming] [growls]
[dragons snarling viciously]
Snotlout, peel off and help Hiccup.
No way.
Go!

I'm not leaving your wing!
Go!

[hunter growling]
-[hunter 1 shouting] -[hunter 2 growling]
-We're hit!

[all gasping and screaming] [growls]
Now, finish it.
[screams]
Snotlout, can you hear us?
Snotlout?
Hiccup?
[whimpering]
No!

-Did we win?

You saved my life.
Yeah, two times.
But if the Dragon Root crops aren't here, where are they?
You see, Hiccup, some plants grow in the sun, and some in the shade, and some in the, some... the partial something, and some in the also partial...

You know, I gotta say, I'm pretty proud of you, Snotlout.
But who really knows what the future holds for any of us?
Yeah, I've been thinking.

You know, we may not be so different, after all.
