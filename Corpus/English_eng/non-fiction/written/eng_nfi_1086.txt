(exhales)
(panting)
Man:

- (crowd shouting)

- Yeah!

- Great putt, sir.

- One moment.

Seth, please, let the caddie carry your bag.
You don't have to prove anything.
Honey, I'm not trying to prove anything.
I always carry my own bag for luck.
Well, it's working.
But, remember, if you start to feel tired or imbalanced, you can always stop and get some water.
Honey, it's okay.
I'm not sick anymore.
I know.
You're doing great.
(sighs, panting)
- Here you go, sir.

(crowd applauding)
Hey, buddy, you're smoking.
I know, right?
I feel great.
No, dude, you're on fire!
- (gasps) - (screaming)
(theme music playing)
- Stone:

- Stone:

Working on something rather sensitive, if you don't mind.
Both:

- I'm telling you, yes, it does.

People, don't randomly explode!
- You mean like that?

Spontaneous human combustion is a myth, okay?
Reported cases are usually found to be accidental deaths caused by a fire nearby.
Usually, not always.

I don't like the unexplainable.
Before we go running off to South Carolina,
I want to look in these books and find out why our amateur golfer might have burst into flames.
Mr. Jenkins, got any ideas where we can start?
(blows raspberry)
(blows raspberry) That's all you got?
There's no magical precedents for spontaneous human combustion.
When it does happen, which is very rare, it's usually a quirk of science.
If it's not magic-based, why would the Clipping Book alert us?
Guess we'll have to go to Charleston and find out.
- Cass, are you coming?

I mean, I'm gonna go talk to a friend of mine at the hospital I used to work at in New York...

He did a research study on spontaneous human combustion.
I'll see if he has anything for us.
Great, so Cassandra and I will head to New York and you guys can go to South Carolina.
No.

He can be a little touchy.
Eve can't go anyway.
I have a mission of my own and it takes precedence.
Precedence over people randomly catching on fire?
I found a code hidden deep within Charlene's ledgers.
Charlene?
She found a way to let you know where she is?
No, I think this clue leads someplace else, and I don't think it was left for me.
Ebb Tide manufacturing in Moose Creek, Alaska?
Why Moose Creek?
It's a town just outside of Fort Wainwright military base where I lived as a kid.
Ebb Tide Manufacturing?
E-B-B are my initials.
- What's the middle B stand for?

"Better not ask if you like your face the way it is."
- Wordy.

- What do you think's in Alaska?

Let's find out.
Jenkins, do you have that rather sensitive but important piece of equipment
I asked you to construct?
Yes, sir.

Excellent.
Eve, come!
Adventure and mystery await us all.
All right, so now we need three doors.
Charleston, New York, and Alaska?
Three doors.
People leave food day and night.
I keep thinking,
Seth will love this lasagna.
- Then I remember.

Vitamins, supplements, aromatherapy... nothing you'd really call "fire-catchy."
Some might even say that's unexplainable.
The funny thing was Seth didn't even need those pills anymore.
He had cancer.

He was terminal.
- And he was playing golf?

It wasn't until we stopped looking for a cure that one found us.
What do you mean a cure found you?
We received a brochure in the mail for a holistic spa retreat.
We went as a last resort.
They healed him.
I have the brochure around here somewhere.
- Let me get the light.

Thanks.
(gasping)
(screaming)
Jones, the curtain!
Man:

- Cassandra?

I called up to surgery.

If we hurry, we can get you...
I don't want the surgery.
If you don't want the surgery, what do you want?
Timeline?
Cassandra, there isn't any.
Your tumor is so large that I'm shocked you could walk in here.
We have to take care of this now.
There's nothing to take care of.
Cassandra.
My home number's on the back.
If you change your mind, call me.
You say ignition was instantaneous?
Man, I'm telling you, she was fine.
And then all of a sudden, yeah.
And then we did this.

Okay, okay.

Like this, and then we...
She's back.

Your friend, the one who did the study on spontaneous human combustion.
Nothing.

- None of which fit our victims.

Victims?

You mean there's another one?

There's been another spontaneous combustion?
Color me intrigued.
Did someone give you caffeine?
So who is the other victim?
It's the golfer's wife.
Yeah, and he was ill, all right?
And they went to this holistic spa...
- The Vida de la Luz retreat.

Man walks in with a terminal illness and walks out doing wind sprints.
Well, are we waiting for?

I'm gonna analyze these further, see if there are any biometric clues hiding within.
Well, you guys set the door.
We've got two victims and a spooky spa to investigate.
- Chop, chop!

If you're looking for a counter-agent for the effects of caffeine,
I'm afraid I've had no luck inventing one yet.
I haven't had any caffeine.
In fact, I've never been clearer in my own mind.
I think we should go to a movie and dinner... at night.

Wow.
Sounds strangely like a date.
Not strangely.

What?

I'm significantly older than you.
Well, you're significantly older than everyone, so...
If I were a thousand years younger,
I would still be too old for you.
My immortality, Cassandra, it practically makes us different species.
I don't think we're that different.
I think we have more in common than you...
Hey!

- Yes.

Yes.
- If I came here, I'd never leave.

- This place is...

What exactly were you expecting?
Invite only clientele, remote lush locations, money.
Yet, a single bejeweled choker or a mirrored Ferrari to be found.
There are no mirrors anywhere here.
Too much contemplation on your outer self hides your inner self.
Welcome to La Vida de la Luz retreat.
- Are you the owner?

I prefer the term caretaker.
I am is Sofia.

Ah, here's one now.

Greetings, friends.

No, we're with the Library.
For the land assessment from the county.
Yeah, we sent a notice last week.
Oh, did a notice come and you forgot to tell me?
Sorry, madre.

I must have forgotten this.
- Hey.

Si, people love to come here, but they don't like to leave.
- Why would they?

We have everything we need right here.
Everything?

Natural springs provide all of our water.
We grow our own produce, hemp for our clothes, and...
Tomas, it's nearly time for the sun salutation.
Don't you have a schedule you must keep?
Of course, mama.
It was very nice to meet you all.

If you want to know about the grounds, you should talk to my other child, Estrella.
Now, please, excuse me.
Okay, so they have their own water source, they grow their own food.
Maybe the cause of the combusting is environmental.
Yeah, or it's personal.
I mean, Seth and Cece don't really seem like the type to randomly ingest something.
Maybe somebody did it to them.
Okay, so, why don't you guys go talk to staff?
I'll snoop around the grounds.
You don't have to snoop.

I'm Estrella, the head gardener.
You're the gardener?
I am.
I also implement agricultural techniques, study soil evolution... the usual bio-geochemical stuff.
So, you could talk to us about the indigenous plants, the organic residue in the soil formation?
I can.
In fact, this is a very rich area, botanically speaking.
The mineral composition of the pedosphere is so interesting.
Do you wanna see?
- Absolutely.

- Come, I'll show you.

Unh-uh, unh-uh.
What is that?
Oh, this rock is all over the property.
It's not any soil additive I've ever worked with before.
But when you get down to the substratum, you can see the sedimentary deposits.
It makes the earth silty, which makes growing plants a dream.
Much more fertile than our last home in Valencia.
Oh, you're from Spain?
Yes, it's wonderful.
I miss it.

Yeah, we have to deal with that giant... book return problem there.
What kind of plants do you grow?
Crops, mostly.
Vegetables, some small grains.
- Wow!

They look wonderful!
Put them in the greenhouse.
- Thank you, Marco.

We even grow kale, which I personally find awful, but everyone else loves for some reason.
I love your enthusiasm.
For dirt?
Well, sounds like it's not just any dirt.
It's not.

But it's remarkable that you can see that, which tells me that you're not likely a county grounds assessor.
It's all right.

I understand some people come here as a last resort.
Yes.
Many people who come here are not well.
Some of them will never get better.
But while they're here, they can have a quality of life they could not have elsewhere.
- How?

Good food.

People find peace, and that makes them better.
But they don't stay better.
That's not peace.

- Not false.

That's just cruel.
I mean, to say that it's healthy living and that's what's gonna save them?
I mean, how healthy is it to have people burning up?
Burning up?
What do you mean?
Nothing.

So, no odd occurrences, no mishaps, no accidental poisonings?
We're always very careful with what we give our guests.
All of our aromatherapy herbs are edible, and they're great for calm and focus.
These aren't good enough.

The zen here is really disconcerting.
Bee balm, calendula, shiso.
We might even be able to eat some of this stuff, but why would you want to?
By the way, not a single garlic bulb or hot pepper to be seen.
Nothing that can make you sweat or spontaneously combust.
There's still something that doesn't add up.
Something just seems a little odd.
- Stone.

What do you see in that door?
My reflection.
And what don't you see?
(phone rings)
Jenkins, I think I know why these people have been catching fire in the sun.
Yes, so do I.
The Charleston victims' ashes aren't human.
They're vampire.
I don't like vampires.
You can see that the vampire ashes are microbially hexagonal.
I can't identify the crystalline structure, though.
- Stakes and crosses.

We forgetting anything?
Hey, Jenkins, do we have any holy water?
Yes, of course.

All right, we don't even know if this stuff is gonna work with vampires that walk in the daylight.
Oh, yeah.
Working right out there in the sun.

There's probably more than one.
I accidentally let slip to Estrella about the combusting.
- You let it slip?

Which means she's a fanger, just like our amateur golfer and his wife.
Jenkins, we're gonna need all the water in the swimming pool.
Okay, hold on, why don't we just figure out what's going on before we start sticking people with pointy things?
But... vampires.
Who are trapped in their existence just like you... or me.
Did you know that Mr. Carsen was in love with one once?
There could very well be more here than meets the eye.
I agree with Ms. Cillian.
Vampire lore is in the European literature wing.
Maybe we can find some precedents on vampires that can tan.
So, Flynn was in love with a vampire?
Yes, she helped him defeat Vlad Dracul.
The relationship did not last very long, but I understand she was an exceptional person.
I see.

Cassandra, there are things you don't understand.
No, I fully understand.
It's not because we're different species.
It's because I'm gonna die.
- No.

You're afraid to start something because you're afraid to get hurt, and that just makes you a coward.
Please, you're angry and...
Yeah, because you have all of this life and you don't do anything with it.
Do you know what I would give for that?
You think I haven't lived?

There was a woman in whose eyes
I saw the sun rise and set every day.
Whose soul was the most brilliantly perfect of any I had ever seen.
You hadn't mentioned her before.
She did not choose me.
She chose another.
But I had already pledged my heart to her for all of the eternity, and a knight can never break an oath.
Cassandra, you are beautiful, and you will find your love some day, but it just cannot be me.
- Are we close?

I don't think I can take another bug bite.
Flynn, if you don't like hiking, why did you bring me out here?
I didn't bring you out here.
The clue in the ledger brought you out here.
No, you did.
Charlene didn't know the name of the Alaskan town
I lived in as a kid.

You've been secretive, evasive, you tore a page out of the ledger.
You, the Librarian, destroying a book!

All right, the reason that I brought you out here is...
(beep)
(music playing)
- There's more.

(whirring)
(buzzing)
Never mind.
It's beautiful.
Well, I promised you a vacation.
I know that I've been a little distracted lately, and you've been very patient.
"Saintly" might be the word I'd use.
Well, Saint Eve, I didn't want another moment to go by without telling you how much you mean to me.
And I thought a little romantic meal in a romantic setting, and maybe a little hike... that hike, why do you like hiking?
- Hiking is terrible.

Yeah, if you're gonna put it like that.
I love it.
Look at them working out here in the sun.
You wouldn't know what they are.
We don't know what they are.

Which is why I'm not taking any chances.
Hi, um, Sofia, this is awkward.
- We were wondering...

And I was wondering if it was really that county that sent you, Librarians.
Would you like some lemonade?
My family and I came here from Valencia many years ago.
I was exhausted.
I'd been alive for centuries.
This was the most beautiful place I've ever seen.
I wanted to meet my last dawn here.
So we swam in the pond, counted the stars.
I said good-bye to my children and waited for the sun.
- But the end never came.

Then I realized I was spared so I can find this place that lets us walk in the sun.
I had to use it for good.
We don't know how it works, but we know that it only does when we're on the grounds, so we built a sanctuary.
Not just for our kind.
So everyone that works here is a vampire?
What about the guests?

Food!

Nunca.

We just take a little in trade.
We haven't killed anyone since we set foot on this land.
What about Seth from Charleston?
He came here, got turned, went home, and a week later he was burning in the sun.
A week?
That's impossible.
We don't turn people.
If we did, they would have to stay here in the spa.
If we leave the grounds, we revert to darkness dwellers.
Okay, then why did they last so long in Charleston?
You will have full access to everyone.
I want to know how this happened as much as you do.
You can start with me.
I don't know who could be doing this.
I thought everyone was happy here.
I mean, I admit that I sometimes miss the outside world.
But this place, it's protected.
It's our home, like your Library protects you.
You're gonna miss it, aren't you?
The Library?

(stammers)
I've spent five decades with people who are facing their final days.
You have the same look in your eyes, the same hunger to keep going.
This was Seth's spiritual and holistic daily treatment regime while he was here
- and everyone he worked with.

She wasn't here for therapy, so her days weren't structured.
Seth was assigned to the composting team.
I'd start with that.

Have fun at the composting pile, mate.
Wait, where are you going?
- The spa.

Which is where I'm guessing Cece spent most of her unstructured time.
Also, I'm in need of a manicure.
Let's go.

Milkweed?
Pollen, soil from the east garden, soil from the west garden.
It's like they're taking the entire spa retreat and putting into individual bottles.
Hey, Jones, this stuff is all over the grounds.
Why do you have a gem loupe?
Why wouldn't I have a gem loupe?
This stuff looks like Amora.
- Amora?

The silicon carbide found in the meteor rocks by Henry Moissan in 1893.
Synthetic moissanite is used as a diamond substitute.
It looks pretty much the same, it's just as strong.
Also, it's really sparkly.
But this real stuff is super rare.
Wait a minute.

I doubt there's been a lot of studies of how moissanite affects vampires' sun aversion, but...
- I think they're doing one now.

I don't care if they are Librarians.
We are too close to shut down now.
No one's ever made it 20 minutes outside the grounds before?
The last two survived a week on this.
Okay.

I'll shut it down.
But as soon as they are gone, we break past these walls.
I didn't follow you to suffocate here.
Soon, the world will know us.
And they will all bow down.
It's called an oligodendroglioma.
I've known for half of my life that I was gonna die.
Just didn't think it would be this soon.
I always thought that when the time came I'd be ready.
Turns out you're never ready.
- I would give anything...

Last time we spoke, you were at the anger stage of grief.
Now you've moved to bargaining.
You can't really bargain with a tumor.
So what if... it could remain a part of you but you could go on living?
Who's bargaining now?
No...
I'm out of options.
Conventional options.
We don't turn people often.
In fact, I've turned anyone before.
But you, you deserve more time.
As a... as one of you?
So I'd be immortal?
You'd never age.
Never get sick again.
Your friends wouldn't have to say good-bye.
I haven't told them... that I'm... running out of time.
You don't have to be out of time.
You could stay here.
With me, together.
Dr. Nassir.

- Oh!

I was at the pond with Estrella.

Oh, how nice for you two.

Shh.

Somebody's been testing the components of the land.
They're trying to come up with a little formula so these vampires can day walk anywhere they want to.
Give me the rock.
These little crystal flecks?

This is the rock that Estrella said made the soil so rich.
It's all around the pond.

Yeah.
Which means a meteor must have crashed here, caused the water formations and, oops, accidentally protected vampires from the sun.
We heard Marco talking, okay?
They used Seth and Cece as an experiment.
They turned them, pumped them full of that rock, and sent them out in the world to be barbecued to see if their little formula works.
- Who was Marco talking to?

But it was somebody in charge...

- Tomas.

No.
Yeah.

She's a bio-geochemical engineer.
It wasn't Estrella.
Okay.

No.

Not you two and your preconceived notions about vampires.
Did you make a decision?
Estrella, do you know what this is?
Yes.

It's found all over the property.
The piece of a meteor, and it's what allows you to walk during the day.
Someone here is trying to isolate the daywalking properties and they're using guests like Seth and Cece as test subjects.
You think I did this?
No.
But I'd be surprised if you didn't know about the moissanite's properties.
You are too smart not to have been curious.
I had a theory.
Who did you share the theory with?
I have to talk to my mother.
Excuse me.

Um, Cassandra Cillian came in earlier to have an appointment with...
Excuse me.

I did, Dr. Nassir?
Are you family?
Yes.

I was just about to reach out to her again.
I haven't heard from Ms. Cillian since we got the results from the scans.
Scans...
Estrella:

- This is not what you think.

Estrella:

Mama?
You did this.
(growling)
They didn't do this.

Yeah.

The one we saw your herbalist in.
Where's Marco?
These Librarians are just trying to make us question what we saw.
You don't know what you saw.
We didn't come here to hurt anyone.
Oh, no?

- Hmm?

- Why wouldn't I bring a sword?

You killed our mother?
They all did.
No.

It wasn't her.
Estrella.

You have to believe me.
Let me prove it to you.
- How?

If it's there, then we're telling the truth.
Yeah.

If there's no secret lab, we'll know.
We could show you.
No.

I don't trust you.
You.

- (grunting) - (growling)
When we're done, take them outside and kill them.
(grunting)
This is a waste of time, Estrella.
Even if there is a secret lab under the spa, that doesn't mean they didn't do it.
Look, someone is trying to crack the secret of the moissanite to allow you to day walk outside the retreat.
What they haven't figured out yet is that grinding down the rock and isolating the particles and ingesting them isn't enough.
Not by itself.
Wha... what do you mean?

We haven't had a proper kill in quite a while.
I'm going to really enjoy this.
Please tell me you have a plan.
Yes, I do.
Does it involve punching and kicking?
Yes, it does.
Never tie up a thief.
- Here, come on.

It's the water.
Over the years, the water's been infused by the moissanite.
You drink it, you grow your crops with it.
You bathe in it.
The microscopic granules from the rock have formed a protective coating that's bonded to your bodies.
That protective coating reflects all of the electromagnetic radiation from the sun.
4,000 granules per micro liter of water reflects 93 lumens per watt.
The effects would only last 7 days.
They wear off without continued exposure.
It's the water, not the rock.
No, no.

- Did you try the moissanite on its own?

- What?

Oh, my God.
It was you.
Estrella, listen to me.
- Estrella, por favor.

- Estrella, Estrella.

These guys are too fast.

- You got me.

Wait!

(growling)
No, no.
Por favor, listen to me, Estrella, Estrella!
I won't.
You killed our mother?
We were happy here.
We didn't have to worry about hunting or being hunted.
It's in our nature to hunt, Estrella.
Mama wanted us to deny all that, to stay here and meditate on the same lawn, smiling every day, helping these people.
This Librarian doesn't understand.
I did this for us, Estrella.
Don't you miss it?
The world?

We can be who we were always meant to be.
I am who I was meant to be.
Time to taste Librarian.
(roars)
Both:

(growling)
Where's Cassandra?
Careful, hermana.

I've actually had a meal in the last 50 years.
You don't know power.
Ah!
Little girl.
You thought you could drive that through my heart?
No.
Then, what are you gonna do with it, huh?
Give it to your sister.
I love you, Tomas.
- Estrella.

- Cassandra?

She needs a hospital, now!
You are so beautiful.
Uh-huh.
When the Library selected you, it chose wisely.
Okay.

I don't want the candles and champagne.
I don't want this vacation.
I just want the truth.
- Eve, I...

If you're leaving again, just tell me.
If it's something else, just tell me.
I'm tired of the secrets.
All right.
Yeah.
- There is something that...

We have to get home.
It's Cassandra.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
I can process Euler's Formula for Polyhedra, but I couldn't process this.
No need to apologize, and don't you ever lie to me again.
I mean, even if I survive the surgery,
I don't know who I am without this.
It's what made me a Librarian.
No, it did not make you a Librarian.
The Library did, and it didn't choose a tumor.
It chose a person.
Someone who I love very much.
It's time.
I don't know why I play this stupid Sudoku anyway.
I'm trying to get these last numbers for hours.
Surgery was intense.
The tumor was deeply entrenched.
Doctor, just tell us.

Hey, you're awake.
Good to have you back, kid.
I'm not back.
I mean, without the tumor, am I even a Librarian?
Oh, pish-posh.

We're all Librarians.
(conversation continues indistinctly)
You okay?
You with the family now.
And you are a Librarian.
Gift or no gift.
1-7-3.

3-6-7.
3-6-7.
That's it.

How did I figure it out?
Um, guys...
About that no-gift thing...
Congratulations.
They said your surgery was a complete success.
Incredibly.
When you collapsed and your friends rushed you off,
I didn't know what to think.
I was so glad when I heard you were okay.
You're part of the reason that I am.
You reminded me that what defines us isn't what we're born into.
It's what we choose to be.
If you ever change your mind and decide you want a little bit of immortality, this is where I'll be.
I think, ultimately, it wasn't the right choice for me.
But you have to know how much the offer meant.
You helped save my life.
I will never forget that.
I hope I'll see you again...
Cassandra Cillian.
