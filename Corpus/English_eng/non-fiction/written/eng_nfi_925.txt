The yacht belongs to Javier Garcia.
Ciudad Natal Cartel's top man in New Orleans.

Dwayne Pride?
Eliza.

Hey.
That woman lives with our target.

She has no idea that Javier is cartel.
What do you think he'll do to her if he finds out
- she's cooperating?

Javier has a computer with a dedicated server where he handles all his business.
If D.C. can't have
Javier's head on a pike, they want one of ours.
I did what I thought was best.
You went rogue.

FBI will take you to a safe house until Javier and his organization are dismantled.
I'm so, so sorry.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you for...
Agent Pride, thanks for coming.
I know how close you and Eliza were.
No, you don't, Garcia.
But you will.
Sorry?
I promised her I'd protect her.
From you.
Now I'm promising you, one way or the other, you're gonna pay for this.

D.C. sent me down to eliminate Ciudad Natal embeds from New Orleans, and that's what I've done.
Time for me to go home.
But the face of the Natal, Javier Garcia, is still walking around like he owns the place.
Yeah.

Not anymore.

We've frozen his ability to access his laundered drug money.
The cartel's effectively defeated.
But Garcia's not, otherwise he would've bolted as soon as we found out he was using the West family to launder the money.

Listen, I'd love nothing more than to bring Garcia to justice, but we both know we don't have enough evidence.
Which is why stopping him and the Natal from using New Orleans as a base of operations will have to be good enough.
Well, it's not good enough for me, and it shouldn't be for you, either.
Look, I know how badly you feel about what happened to Eliza.
He didn't just kill Eliza, he killed two of your agents.
Hey...

Don't you think it makes me sick to my stomach...
Then let's do something about it.
Look, there's nothing to be done.

It's not over for Eliza's family.
They've done nothing but good for this city, and now because Garcia used them, they're financially ruined, their name is ruined.
You walk away, that doesn't change.
This isn't just personal for you, you know, Pride?
It's personal for me, too.
And not just because of what happened to my agents.
Gregorio.

At least I thought we were.
But she... she changed when she came down here.
You...

You're blaming me for you firing her?
No.

Look, I'm ju...

I'm saying that we both lost something in the process.
We both wanted more, but stopping Garcia, defeating the Natal.

Not the best I can do.
Yeah.

Now, Garcia is a matter for the FBI now, not NCIS.
If we can find a way to prosecute him, we will, but you're not to go after him on your own.
I don't answer to you.

Now, don't make me change my recommendation.
Leave Garcia alone.
Don't I know you?
Lasalle.

Just couldn't wait for you to get back, I suppose.
Uh-huh.

Well, I'm not sure, but Pride wants all hands on deck.
Think it's got something to do with Javier Garcia.
Over here.
Yeah, but I talked to Patton.
He said that you guys busted up Garcia's cartel money, and FBI was taking the case back to D.C.
Knowing Pride, that didn't sit well with him.
I heard Isler fired Gregorio.

She okay?
Yeah.

Got a raw deal, if you ask me.
D.C. wanted a scapegoat for letting Garcia off the hook, and she was it.
Yeah.

Yep.
Sorry.
That's all right, life goes on.
Yeah.

You get back from helping your mama with your stepdad, and you're more worried about me and Gregorio.
Hmm.

My stepdad?

Oh.

I just went back to help my mom.

Probably about as much as you want to talk about this.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
You don't answer the phone.
Oh.

I've been concentrating.

I thought you'd be home, packing for NCIS training.
No.

It was a good idea at the time, but I sort of didn't factor in the whole shooting and dying part.
Or rather, the not shooting and almost dying part, in my case.
That's not your fault.

That's what the training's for.
Yeah?

I almost got her killed.
I mean, it wasn't just the lack of training that made me freeze up.
It was also...

Oh.

No, I'm not.
You know, it's one thing to want to expand your horizons, but when other people's lives depend on it?
No, I want to help the team, not hurt them.
I'm just not sure how I can.
Well, Pride thinks you can.
Because he asked me to find you.
Wanted to see us both, A.S.A.P.
It's called Gamblers Anonymous, which, by definition, is supposed to mean anonymous.
Patton, relax, man.

Still, man's in a meeting, he gets yanked out in the middle of it, before I can even get my eight-year cake?
Well, eight years not gambling, you're allowed to miss a meeting or two, can't you?
See?
You don't even know how this thing works.
You ain't supposed to miss one.
Especially the one where you were supposed to get your damn cake.
This better be good.
It is.
- Hey.

I knew you'd be back.
What's going on here?
Sorry to drag you all in like this, but it's important.
Everything all right, Dwayne?
It will be, after we bring down Javier Garcia.
Which I'm in on, too.
Gregorio and I have been going over his files, looking for a way.

Pablo Ortiz.
Well, how big a chunk?
$20 million big.
Problem is, since the FBI's frozen
Eliza's family's assets,
Garcia won't be able to make his monthly payment, which is in two days.
Ortiz'll kill him.

He's not gonna put up with that.
Then, why isn't Garcia running for his life?
He must have some way to pay that we don't know about.
Exactly, which means if we can find that way and cut it off...
Garcia's a dead man.

Unless he wants to confess, in exchange for our protection.
What's the catch?
Catch is, not an NCIS case.
Isler made it clear he'll have us disbanded if we go after Garcia.
But he can't hold it against any of you if you're not involved, which is why Gregorio and I are going it alone.
Got to protect your careers and this office, in case things go sideways, understand?
Like hell you're going at it alone.
What he said.

What they said.
Don't look at me, I'm with them.
Fresh chicory, who wants more?
I'm fine, thanks.
Oh, you've got to keep your adrenaline up, there's a lot at stake.
Wait, where'd these Garcia files come from?
These yours, Gregorio?
No.

You know, for a FBI mucky-muck, he sure doesn't know much about cyber security.
Hack-a-Pat strikes again.
Take it easy, Patton.

Ha.

Wait a minute.

Can you put that up on the plasma?
Those are the West family businesses
Garcia's been using to launder drug money.
Yeah.

It's the only one with Garcia's name on it.
It could be he's skimming a little off the top for himself.

Offshore means it's untouchable.
Yeah, plus it's nowhere near the $20 million he needs anyway.
Unless he's planning on betting the $2 million in hopes to turn it into 20.
Looks like our boy like the ponies.
He's been spending time at the track.
Which, apparently, is where he's at right now.
Christopher said they just pulled up.
Wait, slow down.

Garcia thinks he can make back the $20 million he owes on a bet?
It might be his only way, right?
After all, he's only got two days, or he's dead.
Still, it's a big risk, even for Garcia.
How could he even know that he's gonna win?
Unless he cheats.
Been there, done that.

You want to fill me in?
Okay, a few years ago, eight to be exact...
Patton got into a little trouble with the Louisiana Gaming Commission.
A lot of trouble, actually.
Short story, I got so addicted to games of chance that I took to upping the ante.
I used my computer skills to game the system, i.e. I cheated.
And I had to convince the feds to let him apply his unique talents to Fleet Cyber Command.
Which, getting back to Garcia, the man's got to be juicing the horses.
You know, he's probably paying off the jockeys to inject them right before the race.
Yeah, but doesn't the Racing Commission test the horses after the race?
Yes, but it's not always easy to detect a stimulant.
Especially if it's organic or mineral, like cobalt.
Well, I like the ponies, too.
And poker, craps, roulette.
Anybody else have any secrets?
Dwayne, what I know might come in handy for this.
I'll take all the help I can get, Loretta.
The question is, if Garcia's gonna cheat to win, how can we make sure he loses instead?
And the others are left in his wake.
They come to the wire.
It is Whiskey Tail.
Flowers for Whiskey Tail.
Here's your lineup for the upcoming race:
number one is Colonel Hot Cakes...
Number two...
What's Mayor Hamilton doing in Garcia's box?
I don't know.
Looks like Garcia got over his fiancée's death pretty quick.
That's pretty easy to do when you're the one who had her killed.
There's no way Hamilton knows who Garcia really is, does he?
I wouldn't put anything past His Honor.
Real question is, what is Garcia's plan?
He hasn't even placed a bet yet.
Well, if Patton's right, he's not just here as a spectator.
No sign of any movement from Garcia yet, King.
Went straight to his box.
Maybe he's got more money hidden somewhere than we know.
Yeah, still, he's at the track for a reason.
He's gotta be there to make a bet, doesn't he?
Except he doesn't have to place a bet at the track if he's gonna bet OTB.
- OT what?

It's like casinos, except you can bet on pretty much any sporting event, anywhere, anytime.
Hold on.
So Garcia still hasn't placed his bet yet?
No.

Well, can't you hack into it?
Keep him from even making the bet?
No, not without him knowing.
The best we could do is see what horse he's betting on.
Well, that won't do us any good.
Especially if the horse is juiced and wins.
Hold on a sec.
Horse can't win if it doesn't even start, right?
What are you thinking, Christopher?
Well, there's no time to explain, all right, trust me.
Get the name of the horse Garcia's betting on, and then get back to me ASAP.
Hey, just for the record,
I have no idea what's going on.
Oh, you will.
Look, there's a bungee cord behind my seat in the truck.
Get it and meet me at the starting gate.
Tease me about being a country boy all you want, but it's about to pay off.
Go.
And they're off.
Two minutes to post for the seventh race.
Pick Four, Sweepstakes, and...
Hey, here you go.

You know which one it is?

Problem is Garcia is placing his bet as we speak.
But I got to know which horse it is before it enters the gate.
Otherwise it's too late.
Too late for what?
To spook the horse.
Oh, man.

Find me a rock.
Patton better hurry.
Here.

You're not gonna hurt it, are you?
City Mouse.
Wait, wait, wait.
Patton just said "Garcia placed a bet on number five, 'Go for Broke'."
Go for Broke.
It doesn't get much more poetic than that.
Oh, there it is.
Looks like we have something happening down on the track.
What the hell?
Javier, Javier, what's the matter?
Ooh, Garcia looks really pissed!
So what, that's it?
He just lost $2 million?
It doesn't quite work that way.
All we did was buy some time.
Looks like we've got a scratch.
Go for Broke is a late scratch.
But wait a minute, Garcia still gets his wager back.
You don't lose a bet on a scratch.
Right.

Which means Garcia can still place another bet on another horse by tomorrow night.
It has to be a sure thing, though.
And unless he tries to cheat again, there aren't any of those.
Still, Garcia's desperate.
I mean, he's got to find a way or he's dead.
Patton might have found a way.
If we can get Garcia to bet on it, he'll lose.
Big time.
Then he'll have to either answer to the cartel or to us.
Garcia's running out of time.
He has to turn the last $2 million he's got into the 20 he needs.
Otherwise, Pablo Ortiz rips his heart out.
So far I'm with you.
Yeah, which means if we can get Garcia to think that he's betting on a sure thing, he won't be able to pass it up, right?
In theory, yeah.
But how do we get him to think he's betting on a sure thing?
Same way I almost conned a whole bunch of folks at a certain off-track betting site eight years ago.
Unfortunately for you, that included a certain admiral.
Fortunate, it put me on the wagon.
Unfortunate, it put Pride on the case, which is how I got my butt busted.
I was this close to pulling off that sweet con, too.
Still have a chance if we can pull it off on Garcia.
So when are you gonna let us in on it?
All right, check it out.
This is eighth race, Fair Grounds.
Just finished, right?
You got a happy, cheering crowd.
And now check out that race.
They're at post.
They're off.
Salad Scooter breaks best...
Isn't that the same race?
Indeed it is.
And that is the essence of said con.
You take control of a certain off-track betting site, including every handheld device, computer and TV in the place.
Then digitally delay the already-completed horse race to the site.

So you can bet on the winning horse of a race that's already been run.
That's pretty brilliant.
More like sweet!
Still, talk about your long shots.
Look, first thing to do is take over an OTB site.
All right?

One that happens to be the most swankiest of swanky.
He owes me a solid, so it won't be a problem.
It's gonna be hard convincing Garcia in such a short period of time.
Yeah, well, got that figured out, too.
Just got to find somebody that he trusts to convince him, and I think I know who.
I'm gonna need everyone's help on this.
If Garcia sees me around, any chance of pulling this off will be lost.
You can handle the rest, Patton?
You do your thing, I'll do mine.
All right, what do you need?
I need you to watch Sebastian's back at the OTB.
Wait, my back?

You'll see.

Fine, but who's gonna watch your back?
I mean, no offense, but there's a lot of gambling involved here-- you gonna be all right?
That's the back I've got.
I'm counting on you, Miss Loretta, 'cause after this con is over,
I want my damn birthday cake.
Mr. Mayor.
Oh, dear.
What'd I do now?
Paranoid about something in particular, are you?
Paranoid in general.

Not at City Hall.
Nothing, uh... nothing good could come from that.
Actually...

Going after Javier Garcia.
Need to make him pay for what he's done.
Well, I don't really know how much of a help I can be since I don't really know the man.
Well, you know him well enough to share his box at the track on the same day that Eliza West gets buried.
And the implication is?
Garcia's made a lot of high-level inroads in New Orleans quickly.
We both know that can't happen without your help.
The kind that probably wouldn't stand up to FBI scrutiny.
Uh, I'm the mayor.
I attract business.

Just like every other mayor before me.
Both of whom are still in jail-- my point.
Is this a shakedown, Dwayne?
Is that what this is?
Just asking for a friendly favor is all.
Up to you...

Well, blackmailing a sitting mayor, you must really want to bring this guy down.
More than anything.
Hamilton and Garcia are on the move, Pride.
Looks like Garcia took the bait.
Okay, meet me at Patton's van.
I'm parked just across the street from the OTB.
Showtime.
Garcia's on his way.
All right, Loretta, you're up.
It's a crazy-ass plan, if you ask me.
I'm thinking I like this undercover stuff.
Maybe I can become an NCIS agent, too.
You okay?

I got the place all wired up.
I got control of everything digital.
Should have wireless covered soon.
Okay, and if someone wants to place a bet on the same race we want Garcia to bet on?
Oh, don't worry about it.

Nobody loses but Garcia.
Oh, good.
Because Pride said he'd be here any minute.
Who, Garcia?

No, the plan was to get Garcia to bet on the race tomorrow.
It's still the same.

It's just a meet.
Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah, I'm living a dream.
Just make sure they don't mess up my van.
How concerned are you?
I'd be less concerned if he wasn't in denial about how hard this is for him.
But I'll keep an eye on him.
All right, here we go.
Garcia just entered.
Get ready.
Is there a problem?
Hard to believe nobody here is gonna know the race is already over with.
Yeah, except us...

And the tech wiz behind it only does it once a month, so nobody finds out.
How come you found out?
I got him out of trouble once, and, so, uh, he lets me in on the action every once in a while as a way to pay me back.
Hey, man, I'm doing you a favor;

So, if you don't want to do it, that's fine, you know, go ahead, walk.
You can deal with Ortiz on your own.
You know?

Okay, Patton.
Hey, Mr. Mayor, welcome back.
Who's your friend?
We're here to see Hooker.
Follow me.
Remember...
I know a lot about you, too, Mr. Mayor.
I go down, you go down.
¿Comprende?
Hooker.
We need to talk.
What are you doing here?
You know we're never supposed to meet here.
Javier Garcia, Johnny Hooker.
He wants in.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about blowing your little scam unless you do as I tell you.
He's in, you understand?
How much you thinking?
$2 million.
$2 million?

Ah, don't worry about the Gaming Commission.
I'll take care of them.

You're welcome.
All right, look, come back tomorrow.
Before the fifth at the Fair Grounds, okay?
That's the race.
First...

You're coming with me.
Uh, what are you talking about?
I'm not going...
Like I said...

After you.
Garcia's taking Sebastian, Pride.
What do you want me to do?
Talk to me, Pride, do you want me to abort?
No, let it ride.
For the record, this is called kidnapping.
Okay?

So is your scam.
Sleep well, Hooker?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I always sleep like a baby when I'm being held against my will.
Listen, what am I doing here?
If-If you don't want in on this, that's fine.
I want in.
Just needed to make sure you weren't setting me up first.
Listen to me very carefully.
I am betting more than just money on this race.
I am betting my life.
That makes you my insurance policy, which means if it doesn't work out exactly the way you say it will... you'll be betting your life, too.
We understand each other?
Yeah, yeah.
Good.

Wait, wait, um, you're-you're still gonna have to go to OTB.
Why?
If I can place the bet just as easily from here?
Yeah, but not that big a bet, and-and not at the last second.
Besides...
I mean, how else are you gonna know that no one else at OTB knows the race is over, unless you're actually there to see that it hasn't even started yet?
All right.
They're going to watch you and the race here, live.
As soon as it's over, call me with the winners.
If it's legit, I'll know.
If it's not...

Dwayne.

Still at Garcia's according to Lasalle and Sonja.
All night?
What the hell is going on over there?
What does Garcia want?
Garcia's desperate, Pride.
He's probably making sure Sebastian's on the up and up before he decides to make that bet.
How do you know?
How do you know Garcia hasn't already figured out who Sebastian really is by now?
I never should've let Garcia take him.
I don't know what I was thinking.
You were thinking you didn't want to blow your one chance at taking Garcia down.
Besides, Sebastian could've easily begged out of this.
He had a chance, waved Tammy off.
Yeah, why?

Just so-so he could prove to himself he wasn't afraid?
Prove it to me?
The whole thing is too damn reckless.
I never should've put him or anybody else in that position, not Sebastian, not Patton, not anybody.
Last time I sent somebody over to Garcia's place she ended up dead.
Look, Dwayne, first of all, you didn't ask for our help.
In fact, it was the opposite;

Which means we all knew the risks going in, even Sebastian.
And Patton, too.
He may be struggling, but he's still at OTB, still game.
Look, if you want to blame yourself for anything, do it for surrounding yourself with people who are just as stubborn and bullheaded as you.
Besides, you're not the only one who wants to make Garcia pay;

Because it's the right thing to do.
That's how you taught us to roll.
So, are you in or are you out?
Wake up, there he is.
No Sebastian.
No bodyguards, either.
I'll call Pride.
Yeah?
Garcia's on the move, King.
No sign of Sebastian.
Should we go in?
No, stay put, but be ready to move in on my call.
If Garcia places the bet... as soon as he realizes he's been had, Sebastian'll be in trouble.
It's a beautiful day at the Fair Grounds Racetrack in New Orleans.
Two minutes to post.
The horses are headed to the gate for the fifth race.
Some of the favorites here are Alvarado and Lil Lenexa.
Mile and a quarter for three-year-olds...
Fifth race is up.
Yeah, thank you so much, that's...
Dancing as fast as I can, bro.
Half the field has entered the starting gate...
Garcia just entered.
Garcia just arrived.
I know, I saw.
I think I got all the delays in place, wireless, too.
Everybody thinks the fourth race is still up.
You think?
It'd be easier if I was hacking with my equipment instead of someone else's.
Oh.
You can do this, Patton.
I know you can.
Yeah, well, being around all this gambling is hard enough, but rolling the dice on Sebastian's life is a whole nother thing.
Just breathe, we're almost there.
Race is about to start.
Everybody in position?
Just give me the word and I'll take this son of a bitch down.
Citizen arrest?
Don't have a badge anymore, right?
Got to make do.
All horses are in the gate.
And they're off.
It's Alvarado and Lil Lenexa fighting for the front.
Alvarado, Lil Lenexa.
Lil Lenexa, Alvarado looking for a turn, dueling for the lead.
Here's NOLA Pride, the long shot, making his move...
Patton, hey.
Let's review.

I got to know.
Understood.
Stand by.
Lil Lenexa, NOLA Pride, Proud Mary moving up.
Lil Lenexa, NOLA Pride, Alvarado.
They're in the home stretch.
Here comes the long shot, NOLA Pride, making his move on the inside.

And it's NOLA Pride by a nose!
Alvarado second and Proud Mary to show.
Okay, call your boss right now.
Go, go, go.
NOLA Pride with a breathtaking victory by an inch.
Alvarado is second, Proud Mary a closing third.
Two minutes to post.
The horses are headed to the gate for the fifth race.
Some of the favorites here are Alvarado and Lil Lenexa.
Mile and a quarter for three-year-olds Trifecta...
NOLA Pride,
Alvarado, Proud Mary.
You're sure?
Okay.
But, hey, don't let Hooker out of your sight, understand?
You got it, boss.
Problem, sir?
Problem?

I'm-I'm trying to bet $2 million on-on race five, but it won't let me.
Oh, $2 million, no wonder, that's over our limit.
Get me your supervisor.
Now.
Wait here, please.
The last horse is entering the starting gate.
$2 million?
That's a lot of change.
How do we know it's legit?
I can wire it to you directly.
You got a routing number?
Here.
Hurry.
NOLA Pride win, Alvarado place, Proud Mary show.
In that order.
Got it all, Pride.
Pride?
Christopher, Sonja, go now.
Why did you say "Pride"?
The horses are in the gates, and...
First NOLA Pride, second Alvarado, third Proud Mary.
Again, first NOLA Pride...
What?
What is going on?
What's going on is the FBI has your money now.
Which means you're bankrupt, Garcia.
Don't do it or I'll shoot.
Sebastian.

Uh...

Check that out.
That there would be the bad guys.
You're under arrest.
Citizen's arrest, maybe, but same thing.
This is entrapment.
It'll never stand up in court.
I don't think Pablo Ortiz is gonna give you time for court, do you?
I told you I wouldn't let you get away with this.
Thanks, Roy.
I was halfway to the airport when I got your call, but...
I wasn't even sure if it was even true.
Where'd you think the $2 million came from?
I didn't know.
Still not sure.
Did I get it legally?
No.

Lucky for FBI,
Garcia's waived his rights, he wants to confess.
Confess to what?
Everything.
Cartel embeds, drug smuggling, money laundering, how he used the West family to do it.
Killing my agents?

Like I said... everything.
So is this true?
On one condition.
There's always conditions.
Yeah, just for the record, I'm against it.
I just want him in prison.
I won't last a week in prison;

No deal, no confession.
Well, I'm listening.
I can give you names, important names, I wasn't acting alone.
Cops, judges, politicians.
Bribes go a long way in this town.

Put me in Witness Protection, I'll give them to you.
Witness Protection, are you kidding me?
You're a murderer, you don't... you don't get a life!
Humor me.
Give me one name.
Mayor Hamilton.
Just got off the phone with the attorney's office.
Said WITSEC's fine as long as the names pan out.
After everything Garcia's done, he's gonna get to live out the rest of his life Scot-free.
I can't believe we went through all this for that.
What's he get?
$2,000 a month for food and rent?
A job at a convenience store?
Garcia's life is ruined.
And not like it'd be in prison, which is what he deserves.
I agree.
But now we get more.
You get more, starting with Mayor Hamilton.
Off the record?
D.C.'s been concerned about it for a while now, even considered taking federal control over law enforcement to clean it up.
But in success, this could get D.C. out of your hair for good.
I can't say I don't like the sound of that.
Yeah, I thought you would.
Do I have your support?
Yeah.
Took us long enough, but we finally agree on something, huh?
Still, despite the few...

Likewise.
I am going back to D.C. with a very big win, thanks to you.
If there's ever anything I can do, you let me know.
Actually... there is one thing.
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.
So, uh... what's this I hear about Garcia?
What about him?
Don't be coy with me.
Don't do it.
'Cause I know you know.
I figured the FBI would lock him up, why WITSEC?
Curious how you heard.
It-It makes no difference how I heard, I just did.
I'm just trying to figure out what the hell's going on, and why this scum rates protection.
Must have something valuable to offer.
Well, obviously he does.
So what is it, all right?
You got to know, you got to know, you're the one that brought him in.
Let's just say, I think it's valuable, too.
So you're not gonna tell me, huh?
All right.
I helped you get Garcia.
And if it wasn't for me, you'd still be crying about how he got away with Eliza's murder, so you owe me, Dwayne.
Trust me, Mr. Mayor, you're gonna find out soon enough.

Hey!

Oh, free drinks and Earl St. Clair on the stage?
It doesn't get any better than that.
Whoa!

All right, all right, relax, relax,
I'm drinking mineral water anyway.
You?
Out of all the people and what you did, you should be celebrating, Tiger Woods.
I'll drink to that.
Well, I am celebrating, by getting on the early flight tomorrow morning to Georgia.
FLETC?

Oh, you're actually going through it.
NCIS training.
Finally, the team will be complete.
Well, I still got to pass, obviously.
I also have to learn how to shoot a gun without freezing.
Bygones.

Thanks, guys...
Hey, wait, wait, hold up,
I know y'all didn't just toast
- without Triple P.

The ringleader of the sting?

In fact... we've been waiting on you.

Happy birthday!
Oh!

Barely, but I'll take it.
Yeah!
How about you, Tammy?

You going back to D.C., too?
No, I'm gonna stay.
There's nothing there for me anymore anyway.
Hey, Pride, maybe you need a good bartender.
I'm kind of a vet now, right?
Uh... sorry.
But I might have another job for you.
Isler got DoD to authorize another agent for the team.
Could use an extra hand.
You interested?
I don't know what to say.
You say yes, idiot.
Come on.
Yes!

Thanks for telling me.
Something wrong?
Car bomb.
Just killed Garcia, mid-transport.
Well, it had to be the cartel, right?
I mean, who else would know FBI even had him?
