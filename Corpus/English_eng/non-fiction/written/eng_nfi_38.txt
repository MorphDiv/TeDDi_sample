♪ Turn it up ♪
3,698 songs in this thing.
Does Earth have the best stuff, or what?
Got that right, Quill.

Maybe so, Rocket.

I am Groot.
♪ Whoo!

What's going on?
Time to pack up our Earth souvenirs and head home.
But this is your home.
Yeah.

Besides, the galaxy needs its guardians.
First up, the cosmic seed won't get back to Asgard by itself.
The longer we keep it here, the longer my home planet is a target for bad guys like Thanos.
Who's hopefully gonna spend the next billion years digging himself out of the center of the Earth.
And yet my revenge feels hollow.
What is the purpose of a destroyer with no one left to destroy?
Cheer up, Drax.
Looks like you may have some purpose left after all.
I am Groot?
Beats me, bud.

According to the energy reading, this rock is Sanctuary.
Eh?
Thanos's personal asteroid?
Um, seriously?

I'd be more concerned that it moved since we last saw it.
All right.

Approaching target.

That does not look like an asteroid.
No, but it looks big enough to hold about ten asteroids.
Any idea what that symbol means?
According to something called, "The Internet,"
it stands for, "Avengers."
Otherwise known as some losers about to be ripped off by the Guardians of the Galaxy.
Guess these "Avengers" must take their privacy pretty seriously.
Their security, too.
Security guards.

Easy, Drax.

We don't have the technology to build sentient battle drones.
We barely figured out microwave popcorn.
You know what else you don't have?
Thanos's krutackin' asteroid.
I am Groot.
I know the scanner's picking up a reading.
From inside that doohickey.
That doohickey is too small to contain Thanos's asteroid.
Score one for the master of the obvious, and zero for the rodent's scanner.
My scanner works fine.
And don't call me rodent!
Oh, hey, look.

Let's all relax.
Whoa.

Thanos possessed a lot of powerful artifacts, but nothing capable of this kind of mass shifting.
Who cares?
It's ours now.
I do not know my purpose, but I am certain it is not to be a thief.
We're only stealing this rock back from whoever stole it from Thanos, who probably stole it in the first place.
More importantly, we're protecting my planet.
You know, it's not like Earth is full of mighty heroes like us.
Huh?
Seriously?

Hey!

I don't know who you freaks are, but I know you don't belong here.
I am Groot!
Like the vegetable said, what are you gonna do about it, puny?
Okay, fun fact,
Earth scientists do not normally do that.
I am Groot.
I am Hulk!
Take it easy, big guy.
- Don't hurt Groot!

That the best you got, green freak?
You intruders got some 'splainin' to do!
- Hey, I know that reference.

Ahh!
Put the tree down!
Hang in there, bud.

Hold still so I can smash you!
Very well.
Ahh!
Come on!

You do not seem to be able to make up your mind!
You all right, Quill?
No, come on.

You ask me, Earth defense tech has moved way past microwave popcorn.
But your cyber security's still in the stone age.
Get off!
Ant-Man, Captain Marvel, I wanna thank you two for lending a hand in this mission.
Happy to whip you into shape anytime, Cap.
And once Dr. Banner's done studying that asteroid I shrunk, we can check out this thing we just recovered.
Odd.

It could be trouble, Tony.

Okay, next time you wanna take out your aggression on something, big guy, try a stress ball.
What?

Uh, doubt it.
With my security upgrades, no one can break into this place.
You know, except me.
Tell it to the guys that broke in.
But there was a talking raccoon, and a walking tree, and...
Okay, that sounds nuts when I say it out loud.
Maybe not.
They took the asteroid!
Fan out.

Left!

The other other left, bark brain!
I am Groot!
This armor does not appear as durable as we thought.
Uh-oh.
I think we found our intruders.
Told ya!
Whoa!
Ow!
Now let's smash some alien thieves.
Um, actually, we were just leaving.
You thieves ain't going nowhere.
We were trying to protect your krutackin' planet!
Uh, yeah?

It's not yours.
You Terrans can't be trusted with Sanctuary's power.
Ahh!
Then put down the rock and your weapons, and we can discuss this.
Yeah, we could do that.
Or we could just leave with what we came for!
Afraid we can't let you do that.
Ahh!
Face it.

Well, you'll never lay a puny green finger on me!
Fortunately, I don't have to.
- I will not fight an unarmed opponent.

Seriously?

I'm Captain America.
Yeah.

I was frozen in ice.
Oh.

I've faced deadlier armor.
Heck, I've worn deadlier armor, tin man.
That's, "Iron Man."
And this suit is impervious to any missile, bomb, or plasma blast you can throw at me.
How about a magnet, Iron Man?
Hey, no!
I am Groot.
Well, don't just stand there!

I am Groot!
What do you mean you're already fighting?
Forward, troops!

Let's go while we still have an exit option.
I am Groot!
Ha-ha!

Uh, Quill, it's a tractor beam, not a force field.
I am Groot!
That's not good.
Hang on, Tony.
What was that?
If I had to guess, something big and green.
Aw, can't we go any faster?
Hang on.

Divert it quickly!
Apparently, it's raining Avengers today.
Fire up the jet.

I got this, Tony.
I am Groot!
Is that rock growing?
Yo, Earth monkeys!
Stop messing with my krutackin' asteroid!
"Earth monkeys"?
You know, you should've thought of that before you invaded our planet.
Hey, I'm from here, too, and I'm trying to protect our planet by keeping dangerous stuff like this off of it.
I'm already late to return a nasty Cosmic Seed thingy to a dude named Thor.
- Wait.

Didn't he ever mention the Guardians of the Galaxy, led by the legendary Star-Lord?
Come to think of it, he did say something about a band of misfits, led by the buffoonish Peter Quill.
Yes, that is him.
He is the buffoonish Peter Quill.
So, wait.

Okay, stay calm.

You mean this gizmo that just got crushed?
Get it out, get it out, get it out!
Incoming!
I got this!
I told you, I got this!
Oh!
Oh, crud.
You krutackin' Avengers owe me a lifetime supply of duct tape!
So, Thor never told you about the Avengers?
No.

I live for vengeance.
Yeah, that's not exactly what this team's all about.
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but the asteroid hit our main security hub.
The system still thinks we're under attack...
And initiated the fail-safe protocols.
What kind of fail-safe protocols?
The kind that...

You know, that kind of protocol.
That's not good.
Yeah, we're flarged.
We need a plan to deal with that out-of-control defense satellite.
I'm gonna go with run!
I am Groot!
What kind of fail-safe system did you so-called heroes slap together?
One that will rain vengeance!
Actually, it's meant to protect Earth by stopping hostiles from getting their hands on our tech.
The only thing Earth needs protecting from is you guys!
Hey, we're not the ones who dropped an asteroid on our headquarters.
No, you're just the ones who messed with its size and forced us to.
'Cause you space freaks ripped off the rock in the first place!
I am Groot!
Watch where you're sticking those branches, shrub.
Everyone stand down.

This is all your fault!
Wait.

I can't access the satellite's computer.
Which means someone else is tampering with it.

Questions will have to wait.
Hulk and Iron Man, we need to deflect the beam away from the town.
Gamora and Drax, you'll help me evacuate citizens.
Marvel and Ant-Man, your mission is to disable the satellite with...
Wait.

That's never stopped Quill before.
What do you say we go after them and explain it, Carol?
Don't worry.

Why didn't they tell us the satellite had an energy shield?
Hey, space cowboy.
Probably should've listened to Cap's whole plan.
I don't take orders.

Not that anyone listens to 'em.
So how do we get past the shields?
I know a guy.
My repulsor shield should weaken the beam.
If the beam doesn't fry my suit's circuitry first.
It still packs a pretty good punch!
Flee, tiny humans.
Flee from the vengeance of the Avengers!
Their capacity for destruction is unparalleled.
None shall escape their wrath.
Our job is to protect and reassure the civilians, Drax, not frighten them out of their wits.
Nice to take orders from someone who actually knows what he's doing.
This is not vengeance.
Should you not call yourselves the Guardians?
I think that name's already taken.
You sure you can get us around that shield?
Well, not around, but through-ish.
As in, between the molecules.
Wait.

Whoa!

Whoa!
Oh!

Way smoother than those other Avengers.
Now, do I detect the rugged individualism of a fellow outlaw?
Former.
Captain America helped me put that life behind me.
I guess he's kind of a father figure.
Or grandfather figure.
Yeah, I don't do so well with father figures.
You got a lock pick?
I am a lock pick.
Once an outlaw, always an outlaw.
Only if it's for a good cause.
Tony was right.
Someone else has been tampering with the system.
It's definitely alien tech, but nothing I've ever seen.
Looks like they diverted the satellite beam away from the Earth.
Yeah, and straight at us!
I am Groot!
Move over, tree.

These are sensitive controls.

Quill can.
Eh, point taken.
Proximity alert.
That is one big...
Oh, flarg.
I can't shut it down, but I think I can short it out.
Oh, man!

I saw your playlist.
Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.
If I have to sacrifice my '80s synthpop collection, I'm doing it myself.
A-ha!

All right.

We're the only thing standing between that beam and this town, and we're not going down without a fight.
Ten seconds to impact.
Repulsor shield at maximum!
Brace for impact in five, four, three, two...
Wait.

Well, guess we owe the buffoonish Peter Quill a thank-you.
Uh, Quill?
Score one for team outlaw.
Well done.
Today, you space thieves can call yourselves Avengers.
We have avenged nothing.
Today, you can call yourselves Guardians.
Nice job.
Think us Terrans can be trusted to examine this thing?
Relax.

Hey, Rocket, can we thumb a ride?
Rocket?
Groot?
Anybody?
They're not answering.
Uh, looks like we got bigger problems.
Like gravity.
Rocket, get over here!
We got 99 miles until we're pancakes!
Rocket!
