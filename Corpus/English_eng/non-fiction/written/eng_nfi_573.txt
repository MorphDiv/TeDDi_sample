- We're gonna be late for class.

I don't bite.
- Ow.

I do bite.
This isn't fair, you know.

Shh.

Hang out, just you and me, like it was all summer.
- And do what?

Well, see, I'm not that creative... so you'll have to help me out.
Okay.

When the bell rings, everyone will be inside.
What?

We could do something a little more discreet.
Right here?

Are you serious?
Guess you'll have to skip class and find out.
Rise and shine, sweetie.
I don't feel so hot.
You already missed most of week one.

The doctor said you looked okay.

A little.
Some fresh air will probably do you good.
I'll rise, but I can't promise any shining.
Hey, man, could I borrow that math homework?
- Nope.

- But I have a very good excuse.

'Cause we had a pop quiz.
- Damn it.

- You were with her?

Zig, that girl is crazy.
Okay, look...

You gotta understand.

Yeah, but it's not like you two haven't had all the sex.
- Yeah, but, uh...

You did it at school?
What?
- Really?

So she went down on you.

Ew.

- In the school parking lot.

Easy, okay?
- Did you use protection?

You can still get STIs, I'm pretty sure.
- What kind of girl even does that?

Damaged girls.
Okay, guys.

She just... really likes me.
Yeah, but how many other dudes has she liked in that parking lot?
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.
Do you guys really think it's that bad?
I really think she's gonna make you flunk senior year.
It's not like you're serious about her anyway, right?
Do you think Armstrong will let me do a make-up test?
Maybe if you ask nicely.
But... not Esme nicely.
Everyone, stop what you're doing.
We need to shift the business model for our entire vlog channel.
We've retained most of Vijay's fans from his old channel, but we've hit a wall with new subscribers.
So what do we do?

- Actually, it's a simpler problem.

But the whole point of All-Inclusive is to create a safe-space channel that's welcoming to everyone.
Obviously, our current content just isn't that attractive to women.
No.

Maybe, but we have to find some way to bring them to our channel first.
What would get them to the channel?
The top categories for girls are fashion, make-up tutorials, nail art...
Have fun with that.
Actually, it has to be you.
No.

Okay.

We have to give the girls someone to identify with.
I don't know the first thing about these subjects, okay?
Which is why I hired a consultant.
- It's rad.

And, uh, the crash sounds, they're actually real, too.
We smashed some stuff together and recorded it.
It's about the bus crash?
Yeah, and, uh, how do you move on from a tragedy?
Or, at least, it will be once you add lyrics.
Yeah, and that stuff that Miles said in class actually kind of inspired it.
We're sort of thinking of making, like, a whole rock opera.
Wow.
Well, hope you're feeling better, Maya.
If not, I have a surefire cure.

Uh, actually, you do have to do all of it.
Still... fun, right?
- So, do you have anything?

Uh, lyrics.
Oh!

Yeah.

And you're always so fast with this stuff.
Sure, I'll come up with something.
Great.

This year, we're making Degrassi a safe space for everyone.
For more information, follow the Degrassi community page...
Whoa.

Easy, jumpy.
Figured you'd be all relaxed from this morning.
Yeah, um...
Look, have you ever done that before?
Did I seem out of practice?
Damn.

Um, well, we could skip lunch and try again.
I actually have a thing.
Armstrong is letting me do a make-up quiz, so I kinda have to study.
Why didn't you say so?

I just thought it was more of, like, a solo mission.
Okay, what gives?
Tiny just thinks I should focus more on school stuff and not so much on...
Me?
He's only saying that 'cause he's with that prude Shay.
Look, when we're together, you have to admit we do tend to get... distracted.
I'm really good at math.

Let me help.

No matter how much you beg.
Okay.

- here, here and here...

Then, we're gonna sharpen your brow, overdraw your lips and cinch your waist...
Whoa.

Yeah.

Is this really going to make me more appealing to girls?
Yep.

Looks like I'm wearing a... a mask.
Yeah, a mask that says,
"I put in a little effort today, so come hang out."
Why wouldn't people just wanna hang out with me for me?
Um, I don't know, but don't you want to do what's best for the show?
These things can be pretty slippery.
- Are you okay?

Well, do you maybe wanna talk to somebody?
JK.

And which one is the hypotenuse?
Oh, you're not just a pretty face.

Are you serious right now?
Phone.
Okay.
Cosine.

See, I can never understand what to do to find each one.
Oscar Had A Handful Of Apples.
Okay.

Oscar, opposite.

Of, opposite.
Apples, adjacent?
Precisely.
Okay.

Cosine is, uh...
Okay.

Six?
Zero point six.
Esme?
What the hell?
Yael, you ready?
Don't tell me you like this.
I don't dislike it.
Okay.

Okay.

Hey, team.

Today we are switching gears from games to glam, with some nail art.
Um, have you ever wanted little galaxies on your pinkies?
If so, here's how.
Um, so start with a... a black coat, which I've already done.
And then, um, take some sponge and some indigo.
Uh, apply the blue to small sections of each of your nails.
Just like this.
No, no, no.
- Oh.

You know what?

Yeah, but girls seem to like it.
So?

To make our YouTube channel successful?
Okay.
You know why girls can't get ahead?
Because they spend upwards of, like, two hours every day doing this.
Okay?

I mean, who cares about nail polish?

It's all so stupid.

Girls who care about this are stupid, too.
Esme, where did you go?

"Why," indeed.

Jonah. "Make sure you get her the jumbo Slurpee 'cause she's thirsty."
Tiny. "Are we studying or hanging out with Easy Esme again?"
Hey, I didn't write that stuff.
Yeah, but you wrote this one.
"As long as I don't wife her, what's wrong with some extra third base action?"
Those are just jokes.
About me!
You're the one who's always doing crazy stuff.
What is your issue?
Sometimes you do things other girls wouldn't do.
You calling me a slut?
Okay, then...

- Oh, my God.

- Esme, what are you doing?

- Esme, stop.

- Unconventional, but...

What is happening here?
That's a good question.
So, still think we were wrong about her?
My door is always open if you have any more questions.
Maya.

Just give me a minute.

That's mine.
What's up?
I don't know.

There's so much stuff, you know?
I'm just feeling...
Feeling stressed.
There's been a lot of that going on here.
Senior year is hard.
I don't know if it's just that.
When we spoke in the spring, you were concerned about your music, because you broke your wrists.
I know that you've had anxiety before, so let's start by making a list of all this stuff.
So what's on your plate?
Well, there's homework.
So much homework.
Hmm.
University applications.
My mom's always on my case.

Mmm-hmm.
Mmm, text messages I have to return, my friends leaning on me to do things...
And that's it?
Yeah.
But... it still feels like...
I'm being... pulled underwater... with no way to get to the surface.
I know it can seem hard.
But look at this list.
It's not that big.
And there's a light at the end of the tunnel.
University.
Here.
Berklee...
SoCalArt... those are the programs we've talked about.
Start the application process.
Everything that you check off that list will bring you closer to the surface.
I promise.
You know why girls can't get ahead?
Because they spend upwards of, like, two hours every day doing this.
Okay?

I still can't believe you posted this rant without consulting us.
Why not?

But have you seen the comments?
Idiots always flame the comments section.

Oh, God.
Hey, could I borrow a pen?
Aren't you worried I might accidentally pass you a banana?
Because I'm too stupid to know the difference?
- You watched the vlog.

I was defending womankind from unfair beauty standards.
It seemed like you were saying women who wear makeup are idiots.
Just the ones who put too much time into it.
What's wrong with spending a little time on yourself?
- It's the patriarchy oppressing you.

I do it for myself.

No, you do it because you like how boys look at you when you wear it.
Actually, I'd prefer they didn't.

- So you'd do at home?

If it makes me feel good, then what's the problem?
Because girls like you are ruining it for the rest of us.
The comments section idiots might have a point this time.
I think we need to call another emergency meeting.
And, no, I don't have a pen either.
Hey, Maya.
Do I make crappy decisions?
Are you talking about Esme?
I mean, the summer was great.
Sounds nice.
Then when we got back to school, everyone started weighing in.
So why do you care what your friends say?
Well, they're not wrong.
She's messed up.
Who isn't?
If you like her, don't let the chorus of idiots trying to shame women's actions stop you from being happy.
- Thanks, Maya.

We've been waiting for you for 40 minutes.
- I'm so sorry.

- All right?

It's just between school, university stuff, and then...

I don't know how to do it all.

You're not alone.
Yeah, I mean...
You know, I mean, I've got a stack of university brochures that are... this high at home.
Uh, why don't you just take tonight off, get your school stuff sorted out, and we can jam tomorrow?
- Yeah.

Esme!

- I have a gift for you.

Eighty-two.

Hey, this is the best I've ever done.

Esme, I'm sorry.
Okay?

I should have never let anyone say those things about you.
I don't care what anyone says about me.
Your opinion was the only one that mattered.
Esme, I think the world of you.
What happens when people start saying other stuff?
Darker stuff?

- You freak out and bail then, too?

Did you know I've been in and out of therapy my entire life?
- Nothing wrong with that.

And maybe I took too long to call 911 or I shook her the wrong way.
But after a few weeks in the hospital, she died.
Look, Esme, I'm sure that wasn't your fault.
Dad still kinda blames me.
Is that why you reacted to those hospital pictures of Tristan?
Guess that brought me back, yeah.
Look, I know it's not the same thing, but...
My parents blame me for stuff, too.
Like what?
Like, my Mom kicked me out... for selling drugs... hanging with guys who had guns, endangering my little brother.
I'm on probation for another year, and I live in a group home.
And I guess since I don't have a family,
I listen to my friends a little bit too much.
You have me.
Let's call the meeting to order.
Great.

You have to.

What we can't have any more of is this kind of negative feedback.
Yeah.

If we're trying to reform our image from last year, we can't engage in these debates.
They're divisive.
So what?

I thought you liked that other me.
I was just surprised.

I'm glad you said that, actually.
Um, we all know that authenticity is the key to engagement.
And I've come to realize that there's more than just one kind of girl, and I'm just not that kind.
But you know who is?
What if I do the gaming videos and Lola does the make-up, fashiony stuff?
I mean, I know this complicates things, but I just thought it was...
All those in favor?
I'll draw up the contracts.
Can I help design your backdrop?
I'm so glad that worked.
So, what game should I review next?
Uh, I don't know.
But I should, um, probably give her a camera tutorial, right?
Yeah, okay.
It's like The Matrix blue-or-red thing.
