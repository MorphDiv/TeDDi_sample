[Zoe] So, today is a big day for the stables.
[boy] It's pony camp!
- [kids laugh] - [Zoe] Super exciting.
But it's hard to think about the fun times when a pony has been stolen.
And you kind of got someone wrongly arrested for being a horse thief.
And if I could just go to the stables, I could sort it out... but I'm banned.
[knock on door]
Wanna see Gramps have his plaster taken off?
You know, as fun as that sounds... [chuckles] Didn't think so.
What if she's not going to the hospital?
In Mom's diary, it said she was in love with somebody who was called "E."
"Elliot" starts with E.
That's your evidence, the alphabet?
I'm still building my case, thank you very much.
If you and I could go and get squished by some crazy horses?
Great sister skills.
I just really need to talk to Pin, okay?
You know what?
[sighs]
Raven told me I was wrong.
Raven?
As in, the horse?
Why don't you come?
Well, then I'll take you straight to the Center for Made-Up Diseases.
It could happen.
Have I done it right?
Guys?
Um, sorry, Ben, we were too busy assessing the way Marcus' horse approaches the jump.
[crowd clapping and cheering]
He is so hot.
He's amazing.
[crowd clapping and cheering]
Remember, it's all about confidence, in yourself and in your horse.
[all cheering]
Maybe he has a point about that.
This place has so much poop, they might as well rename it The Poop Palace.
Welcome to the neigh borhood.
Get it? "Neigh"?
Think you're gonna be okay with these guys for a few minutes?
Sure.
I'll just try to stand very still and not touch anything.
Or anyone.
Get ready for the mane event, where you'll see the reining champion.
Uh, Zoe, I changed my mind!
[drill whirs]
Dad, don't.
Just stay away from that girl.
Hey.
Firefly was an easy target.
A beautiful horse in a broken stable.
Are you okay?
I'm never gonna see him again.
If it wasn't for you, Firefly would be here.
Because of you, no one was watching the stables.
Firefly was alone, and they took him.
Guys, can we keep a lid on all the stolen horse talk?
I need the kids to be leaving here raving about us.
Yeah, I get it.
No wonder you're worried about the reputation of your stables.
This is all my fault.
I shouldn't have called Pin a horse thief.
Okay?
Okay, guys, let's get this camp started.
Everyone meet in the paddock.
I know I hurt Pin, but...
But it's more than that, isn't it?
Hey.
So, I've got a list of people who hate me right now, and...
I'm just making sure you're not on it.
Hey.
[Sam] Can everyone gather round, please?
Welcome to Bright Field Stables' first ever pony camp.
[crowd cheering]
Thank you, officer. [Clears throat]
Totally in love with her.
She has no idea.
And as riding is very hungry work, you'll be very pleased to hear that our barbecue is up and running.
[crowd] Ooh!
No.
[Sam] So, impress me.
Okay, campers under 12, come with me and grab a shovel,
Come on, or there won't be any poo left.
I'm gonna stink until I'm 16.
[Becky mumbles]
Here I am. [Chuckles]
You gonna start secretly filming me again?
[chuckles softly]
My mom ended up signing the permission slip anyway.
She used pink pen, and her handwriting was shaky,
[Marcus] You still have Fletcher, haven't you?
I'm just afraid Mia's gonna get rid of him.
Come on, Becky, tell her your theory.
If you impress Sam again today, she might let you ride Raven.
Then you can work out his interpersonal problems,
Well, believe it or not, she's actually the brains in this outfit.
Hey, Pin!
Hey...
If you would just talk to me for one second.
[stammers] I just... [sighs]
[Sam] Look, don't get me wrong, I feel terrible about Firefly.
Then get CCTV, security fences, a gate that actually locks.
Saddle up.
You don't seem to realize, that horse cost me a lot of money.
- I'm watching you, E. - [door closes] [engine starts]
Ew.
I've never seen so much poop in my entire life.
It's not even that big at the moment.
After pony camp, it's gonna be twice the size it is now.
Wow, I can't wait to see that.
Ah, me, neither.
I don't get why people like these horrible hairy poo bags so much.
Well, they're powerful, beautiful, and the way they move, there's this kind of freedom...
They may be powerful and beautiful, but they still stink.
[chuckles] [whinnying]
Raven, if I could take you out, I would.
Won't be gone long.
Are you sure you'll be all right on your own, Rosie?
I'll survive.
Probably.
I know you're not used to horses.
You will be super careful, won't you?
You stay here and join the little ones in the paddock.
Probably more your level anyway.
[Pin] Everyone ready?
And here I was thinking that stealing and getting arrested were his only talents.
Go.
Make up with, uh, Mr. Cheekbones over there.
Thank you.
Uh, don't forget to tell him about your ability to talk to horses.
Look, I really am sorry.
And, also, I guess I just think...
Is everything okay?
Are you in trouble?
Pin, whatever it is, let me help you.
What am I supposed to think if you won't talk to me?
Woo-hoo!
Wait, what?
[Zoe] Wait.
Pin, get back here!
[Zoe] Wow, this is amazing.
Pin, where did you go?
Can't take a hint, can you?
What were the sedatives for?
To keep Firefly quiet so I could steal him.
[horse whinnies]
Tell me you didn't.
Firefly?
He's a moor pony.
[Pin] He's the council's responsibility.
But they've no money to treat the wild horses, so... they'd put him down.
You were taking the medicine for him.
Pin, I am so sorry...
Do you know what thieves do to horses?
Sell them to people that don't even like horses, that just wanna own something shiny and expensive and wild.
You thought I could be a part of something like that?
Until you look beyond what's in front of you,
You should go now.
Dad doesn't want me talking to you, and now I know why.
Just go.
You all right?
She won't be bothering us again.
[Becky] Beyond those hills is the old barn.
Which, by the way, is totally haunted.
That barn is about as haunted as my saddle pad.
Hundreds of years ago, a greedy lord heard of the great treasure hidden in the hills.
I mean, this story needs facts.
[Becky] Jade, you're interrupting my story.
He rode out in search of the treasure, and then a huge storm came in.
But the lord pushed on, desperate to find the loot.
And then he froze to death.
Now the ghost pony wanders the moors.
And until she's reunited with her master, she'll claim our souls, one by one.
- [horse whinnies] - [Susie gasps]
Grow up, Becky.
So... come on.
Why is Zoe chasing Pin?
Something else she wants to wrongly accuse him of?
I'll let you in on a secret.
Please do.
Zoe is absolutely petrified of the Ghost Pony.
Come on, Susie, this is boring.
Susie?
[scoffs] It's such a beautiful day, and you've hardly taken your eyes off your phone.
Come on, give it over.
I'm not giving you my phone.
Susie, remember our no boys pact?
If one of us is single, then...
Then we both are.
It's not like anyone texts you anyway.
I'm kidding. [Chuckles]
[laughs] "Bail." Like "hay bale."
I was given a job, and I'm going to get that job done.
[Jade] Becky, it's this way.
I knew that.
See, it's all about concealing the flaws.
With a sparkly scrunchy, we're taking attention away from his snaggletooth.
I know, right?
It's amazing what a little LA style can do to a matted, neglected mane.
You know, I really thought you'd be long gone by now.
Well, someone told me that horses are beautiful, and maybe they were right.
Okay, you need to comb the tail, not tickle it.
Here.
This old thing needs all the help he can get.
No offense.
[chuckles]
I mean Elliot.
Look, let's talk Zoe.
Everyone says she's this amazing rider.
Anyway, your dad... is he, you know, seeing anyone?
But, um, Zoe, she's had lots of riding lessons back home, right?
She really is a natural rider.
Good for her.
I thought we were close, like sisters.
Zoe's not allowed to ride?
That's so sad.
Where have you been?
I just decided, in my role as hack leader, to take a little detour, that's all.
That I'm an idiot.
He's been taking the sedatives to treat an injured moor pony.
Yeah, but instead of watching him,
I should've been watching the real thieves.
[Jade] You thought you were doing the right thing.
Tell that to Firefly.
Don't let this ruin your day.
You're right, you're right.
[Jade clicking tongue]
Hey, wait for us.
Whee!
They're back.
Is that Zoe?
Mom.
You promised.
[Zoe] She's right, Mom.
I rang her before you told me, I swear.
I would never drop Zoe in it.
One foot in this place, I'm shipping you back to the States.
[sighs] Yes, I understand.
[Maggie] Rosie, get over here.
We're leaving.
[Jade over phone] So, when you got home, on a scale of one to hangry T. Rex, how mad did your Mom get?
I think she might talk to me again when I'm 18.
She blames me for Firefly.
[Jade] She's the one that put Firefly in a stable with a broken door.
I mean, Firefly was right there in a broken stable.
The thieves didn't really need to try.
What if they didn't take Firefly because the door was broken?
What if they took him
Sometimes you need to look beyond what's in front of you.
The thieves took the wrong horse.
And when they realize their mistake... they'll come back for him.
[door clatters] [snorts]
