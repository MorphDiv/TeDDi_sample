And now, The History Channel presents
The True Story of Henry Ford.
This is my Jew Flattening Machine.
It'll flatten any Jew.
Simply climb behind the wheel, drive it towards a Jew, and flatten him.
Could you also use it just to drive from place to place and stuff?
It-It's a Jew Flattening Machine.
It's not what it's designed for.
But you could use it that way?
How was marching band practice?
Peter, you know this is a pilot's uniform.
It represents years of specialized training.
Hold still.
Thank you, Korean sweatshop animator.
You've earned your nickel this week.
Where're you coming from, Quagmire?
I had to fly to Aruba, so I brought my mom along with my "friends and family" discount.
Did you...
Yes, Joe, I got you a magnet.
Where do you even put all those magnets, Joe?
Well, you know I have that fridge in the garage with bags of blood in my blood type?
What's "friends and family"?
Oh, airline employees can get discounted tickets for family and close friends.
If I'm being honest, I've also got a few Celeste pizzas in that fridge.
I don't know, I-I guess I just figured you guys always have to work, or you're with your kids.
But sure, yeah, I could take you somewhere.
San Francisco?
That city from And the Band Played On and Milk?
I'm in!
Yeah, thanks, Quagmire.
Oh, wow, this'll be great.
Hey, can you make us X-Men?
What a surprise.
Well, I'm off to San Francisco with the guys.
Okay, I'm off to Hilton Head with the girls.
I told you about this a month ago.
I'm going with Bonnie and Donna to Donna's sister's time share.
Well, we can't both go on a trip at the same time.
I'm sorry, Peter, but I already have a taxi waiting.
All right, I'll go tell the guys I'm not going.
Why is he taking his suitcase to tell the guys?
Son of a...
Oh, and the idiot took my suitcase.
Aw, he was taking me with him.
Ah, San Francisco.
So what are we gonna do first?
I want to see the Golden Gate Bridge.
I want to see Lombard Street.
I want to see Ghirardelli Square.
Guys, guys.
Let's get lesbian haircuts and see 'em all.
All right, the gay jokes are out of the way, now let's get down to business.
Okay, guys, this is the original Levi Jeans factory, created by Levi Strauss in the year 1853 so that gold miners could wear a comfortable yet durable fabric.
This is boring.
Well, then you plan the vacation!
Aah!
Peter, Peter, calm down, it-it's okay, we'll-we'll do whatever you want.
All right, if you promise.
I was thinkin' we could tuck our shirts into our pants, put on huge helmets, and ride Segways.
You guys, look.
It's Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry.
Oh, my God, Steph, I'm such a big fan.
Hey, I know we just met, but can I sit on your lap during your next post-game press conference?
Sure, I don't see why not.
This is exciting for the whole Bay Area, to be just four games away from the championship...
Dad, I dooked.
That other team's not just gonna go away, though.
We've got to stay focused, keep doing what we've been doing.
Yeah, I-I see her, Peter.
Make her go.
That's not how we talk to people.
Make her go.
I'll leave.
I didn't realize how hilly it was gonna be.
Thanks again for taking us, Quagmire.
Hey, no problem.
Hey, you know, we're here early.
You guys want a little tour of the plane?
Yeah, that'd be great.
Normally I'd just go to Hudson News and pretend to be the most important guy there.
Can I help you?
Yes, I will have eight Dasanis and a JD Power  Associates.
Wow, this place is cool.
Like, what's this red one?
Oh, that's a voice filter, so the passengers always think the pilot is a 60-year-old Midwestern white man.
Hi y'all, this is Cleveland.
Good afternoon, folks, this is Captain Dale Clark up here in the flight deck.
We're way up in the air.
We've reached our cruising altitude of 37,000 feet.
Y'all get ready to watch Big Momma's House.
Our in-flight entertainment today will be Under the Tuscan Sun.
Ooh, I like that.
I hear it's good.
Hey, what's this button? "Autopilot"?
Oh, that allows the plane to fly itself when I need a break.
W-What do you mean, "a break"?
You don't have to fly the plane?
You don't have to touch it, Joe, you can just say you noticed it.
And what's this booth over here?
Oh, that's my back-in-time box.
I go inside, magically go back in time, and then come out and react to the fact that we're flying.
By God, we're levitating.
That's just a box full of costumes.
It's my back-in-time box!
That's not true.
I broke Gandalf in half.
It's Dumbledore!
I was a Navy pilot, you jerks.
Get the hell out of my cockpit.
All right, let's see what's in the in-flight magazine.
Muscular old guy.
Already filled-in crossword puzzle.
Ooh, this is food for different routes I'm not on.
All right, time to use the potty.
Don't say "potty." You're an adult.
Okay, nobody move!
Oh, my God, those guys in first class have guns.
Cleveland, just be happy with what you have.
Don't envy people.
No, Peter, we're being hijacked.
Close the cockpit door!
This plane now belongs to us.
You move, you're dead.
So nobody try to get smart.
Control tower, this is flight 364.
We have a hijacking in progress.
Our flight has been...
Oh, damn it, they jammed the transmission.
I'm gonna have to go to the backup communication system.
This is Flight 364.
We're being hijacked.
This is your last chance.
Open the door, or your copilot gets it.
Why are you doing this?
America needs to be punished for supporting the other side of my country's civil war.
Which country?
Do you really want to know, or are you just asking because we're gonna be on a plane for a while and you think you should make small talk?
The second thing.
Open the door, or I'll start executing passengers.
Man, coming on this trip was a terrible idea.
I know, now I wish I'd just stayed home and finished my remake of Inside Out.
I'm Joy.
I'm Sadness.
I'm Anger.
I'm Disgust.
I'm Poo.
Ooh, I need to use the bathroom.
We interrupt this program with a special report.
A flight from San Francisco to Quahog has lost contact with air traffic control.
Oh, my God, that's your father's flight.
Government officials are monitoring the situation closely.
I'll be here to update you as this story progresses.
Coming up on the midday news, a couple in their 30s gets married without their dog being in the wedding.
You're not gonna believe their story.
What's it gonna be?
Are you going to open this door, or am I going to start killing people?
I'm not opening it.
Excuse me, I'd just like to ask the mom behind me who told me to stop watching Game of Thrones on my laptop if I'm still "the worst person on this plane."
Aah!
Okay.
Wait... wait, what?
That-that was quick.
I'm sorry, Peter, but I have to think about the whole plane.
There's over 150 passengers back there, several of whom are in our Commander's Club, and to them I'd like to issue a special welcome.
Oh, man, we got to help Peter!
Those crazy European guys are gonna kill him!
You know, I have a gun in the bag I checked.
If we can get to the galley, we can take the elevator down to the cargo hold.
Good idea, Joe.
Oh, man, it feels like we're in one of those hijacking movies.
Can't you see how important I am?
My shirt is blue, but the collar is white.
It's the same shirt!
Quick, he's distracted.
"Get off my plane."
"Get off my plane."
Nothing.
"Always bet on black."
"Always bet on black."
- "Double trouble!" - "Double trouble!"
Okay, you guys watch the main cabin.
I'll go find them.
I'll take this fat guy as a human shield.
Everybody be quiet!
There's another update!
The search for a missing airliner continues, as speculation grows that the plane has been hijacked.
Oh, this is all so awful!
What will our lives be like if our husbands don't make it?
Hey, Joe, look at me.
Do I look like Mickey the Mouse?
Get out of people's stuff!
Ah, here's my bag.
Oh, someone's shipping live lobsters.
Yum.
Prepare to die.
You first!
That's what you think.
Attention, passengers, I know we're being hijacked, but I would be remiss if I didn't point out that we're presently passing over Yosemite National Park.
It certainly is.
And you know what you don't see from up here?
Borders.
Die in hell, Eurotrash!
Hang on, Peter!
Holy crap, that was close.
Joe, how'd you know that lever would open the landing gear?
Wheels are my expertise, Peter.
I notice every wheel in a room as soon as I enter.
Special delivery from the U.S. of A.!
Aw, rats.
My bullets are in my shaving kit.
Oh, my God, you guys did it!
We're saved!
Yep, we wrapped this up quicker than the treaty signing at Appomattox.
So, if I sign this, the war is over, we surrender, and we still get to be dicks forever?
Okay, you win.
You can all relax now, everybody!
We're ten minutes away from landing at an airfield in Nevada.
Looks like you'll make that business meeting after all.
Now reach for it.
And now I can finally get into the cockpit and execute our plan:
crashing this plane into the ultimate symbol of American materialism,
Las Vegas.
You know, I've lost a ton in Vegas, but I never thought I'd lose my life there.
You know, you are seriously funny, man.
I know I crap on you a lot, but sometimes, when I'm driving, I think about stuff you say and I laugh.
Get ready to say good-bye to your precious Rita Rudner.
Is-is your plan just to kill Rita Rudner?
Killing Rita Rudner will just be the custard on the dumpling.
You know, we never quite nailed down what region you guys are from.
As you can see, I've taken off my blazer to show the severity of the situation.
We understand the plane has been found by satellite.
It's apparently veered off its flight plan and is headed for Las Vegas.
The government, fearing the worst, is considering shooting it down.
Now here's an over-the-top news graphic.
Nightmare over Vegas.
Hijack Jackpot.
Oh, look, there's one guy who slept through this whole thing.
Hey, buddy, wake up.
We're all about to die.
Yeah, I thought I should wake you up.
Nobody wants to die in their sleep.
There you go.
Only a few more minutes until your country pays for its imperialistic sins.
Like-like, how come you Eastern European guys can't be quieter in pornos?
I mean, nobody's ever been like, "Yeah, yeah, more guy noises."
They ask us to do that to cover up the sound of children playing nearby.
Now shut up and get ready to die.
So, uh, you ever been to Vegas before?
No.
Well, I think you're gonna... flip for it!
Attention, passengers, the plane...
That was some quick thinking, Glenn.
He's here to shoot us down!
They must think the hijackers still control the plane!
And our communications are jammed, so we can't even tell them everything's okay!
Don't worry, I'll signal to 'em.
We kicked their asses and we have their guns!
I've got a visual on the terrorists.
They've got a hostage in a blue shirt with a white collar.
He must be an important businessman.
Oh, good, he's movin' away.
He thinks we're gonna crash into the Strip!
Everybody in your seats!
Frank Caliendo does a 5:00 show?
Quagmire, land this plane!
We've been hit!
Oh, God, this is it!
We're gonna die!
Like hell we are!
We're gonna make it.
We're going too fast!
We're gonna crash into that lake!
Oh, no, we're not!
And now to discharge the plane's fire retardant.
Giggity.
Wow, Quagmire, thanks for saving all of our lives.
We're sorry for saying your job was easy.
Yeah, you're the best damn pilot in the world.
Thanks, guys, that means a lot.
Boy, that was quite a trip, wasn't it?
Peter!
Dad, I was really worried, so I pulled a record of your credit card purchases in San Francisco, and I saw some things
I think you'd prefer to keep private.
We'll talk later, Chris.
I think we will.
I do believe we will.
Well, let's head home.
I know I, for one, am ready to put all this behind us.
Sounds good.
Oh, yeah, in case we didn't say, this was Spirit Airlines.
