Previously, on Reign...

I played her masterfully.
She wants to be a courtesan.

I am meant to help you,
Mary, Queen of Scots.
It is my purpose.
Rizzio, I am blessed to have the loyalty you have placed in me.
You must say that I acted on my own.
You must ban me from Scotland.
Summon Lord Bothwell.
I know he would rather die than see you harmed.
I've kept you safe, and aware of Darnley's true nature at every turn.

Yes.
Leeza said Charles is unwell and I was needed immediately.
Your brother is quite recovered, Henri.
So he's not going to be abdicating?
No.
I am pregnant with your child.
I will be a good father and a good husband.
On that you have my oath.
She certainly adores her mother.
You'll know the feeling soon enough.
I hope so.
Thank you for returning to court, Greer.
I'd lose my mind keeping this secret alone.
Only Darnley knows you're pregnant?
I told James before he left.
I was hard on you about James.
Yes, but you were right.
In trying to protect my throne, I... put my brother in a dangerous position that ended with his banishment.
And now I fear there is a cost for everyone I love.
Well, Darnley should be safe, then.
For your information, Darnley's been on very good behavior recently.
It sounds like you're warming up to him.
I'm not sure I can, but he is the father of my child, and... he's trying.
So I can try as well.
Could something else be in the way, perhaps?

If you are talking about Lord Bothwell...
Mary.
I've been looking for you.
I have news from England.
I'll leave you two alone.
It's not public knowledge yet, but my friends at home in England are saying that our marriage has pressured Queen Elizabeth the Archduke Ferdinand of Austria.
A Catholic?
Yes.

She won't go through with it.
You married me.
Didn't you?
To ensure your survival against your cousin?
Well, now she is doing the same.
If Elizabeth marries the archduke, we will lose our Catholic advantage.
The Vatican may shift its support to England.
Because they will already have a Catholic king on the English throne.
Yes.
I know that we now have a child to consider, but if we wish to take England, our forces must strike before Elizabeth announces her engagement.
It is now or never.
I always knew this day would come, that as queen, I would have to order the attack, but yet...
It is still a terrifying decision.
But you won't have to face Elizabeth alone.
Just say the word, and I will call forth my English allies to help us.
1550 Bordeaux.
Delicate nose.
Floral.
Earthy.
Yes, I do like that.
You've taught me so much about wine, court... and men.
And... how is King Charles?
His younger brother's presence is bound to shake him.
This morning the king seemed concerned that Henri is taller and stronger.
I acted as if I hadn't noticed, as if no man is bigger than Charles in my eyes.
Well done.
A king's confidence is essential, and you are the source of Charles' confidence.

That's incredible, Henri.
Every battle is incredible.
I can't describe it, but the air you breathe changes.
It's full of terror, of life and death.
And the sound is deafening, like a thunder.
You can't imagine if you've never b...
Charles!

What's going on?
Henri planned a family celebration.
In your honor, brother.

Someone should have told you.
I'll find that servant and toss him.
But you're here now.
To the king!
Henri, show him what you brought.
Let's see.
I have jewelry, like this temple ring.
A Hungarian saber taken from the front lines.
I also thought we could have some fun with this.
It's called The Goetia...

I took it from the last surviving Turk on a battlefield full of dead soldiers.
Before I killed him, he swore its spells are what kept him alive.
What kind of spells?
Anything your heart desires.
I was thinking we could perform some magic on Charles.
I don't believe in this nonsense.
I'm sorry that I'm late.
Even Mother was invited?
Henri was just showing us his Goetia.
We're going to do some magic.
Give that to me.

Henri, why did you... bring this into French court?
You know that this is dangerous.

I forgot you're a believer in the occult.
The great seer Nostradamus showed me there are forces beyond our understanding.
- Stay away from this.

Charles?
What is that?
Don't be cross.
I was just trying to show Charles a good time.
Is that so?
I know that you came here expecting.
Charles' throne, and to be denied is certainly a disappointment.
But we mustn't let Spain divide us from within.
I have recently written to your sister detailing all of Charles' victories against the Protestants, and I am praying that she allows him to stay on the throne.
You should do the same, Henri.
When one Valois is weakened, the entire line is threatened.
I will pray for him, Mother.
I promise.
Our current plan is to take Queen Elizabeth hostage in her own castle.
I've invited my most trusted English friend,
Lord Barrett, to lead the mission.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Elizabeth's castle has vulnerabilities on the south side that we've long been aware of.
King Darnley's allies across the border will join our cause, but we will need gold to fund the coup, and we will need more men.
If you can give me an advance team of your most skilled
Scottish soldiers, then I can bring them across the border and into England to recruit more to our side.
Then we will have the numbers to seize her castle in the dead of night.
Once Elizabeth is captured, and the castle is secure, the Scottish navy will attack from the shores.
Our infantry will move in from the borderlands, and should all go according to plan,
Spain will follow suit, and England will be won.

Can my fellow English count on you, Queen Mary?
On the night of the coup, Darnley's allies will all be risking death without ever having met you.
And they will need more assurance than my word.
Tell your men that I recognize that they are risking their lives to install myself, and King Darnley, on the English throne.
And so I offer them my royal seal... as a promise of my support.
With the full power of the Scottish military.
I know that they are risking everything, and by trusting them with my seal, so am I. The question remains, once Elizabeth is taken prisoner, what will we do with her?
I pray that my cousin will publicly acknowledge me as the rightful heir to England.
And if she doesn't?
We will make that decision when the day comes.
When the English throne is ours, we'll look back to this as the moment that changed everything.
Darnley, I... couldn't have done it without you.
I'm honored you've chosen me as your intended, Queen Elizabeth.
Archduke Ferdinand, you certainly have risen above your competition.
I am well aware you've been looking for a Catholic king.
Yes, I have.
And you are... everything I've been looking for.
However, any public announcement should wait until our countries have agreed to terms.
Tomorrow's event with the nobles will simply be a public stroll.
I can do that.
Elizabeth,
I hope you know
I'm not just marrying you to share a crown.
I want something real.
As do I.
I only have a few moments, but I needed to see you.
How is the archduke treating you?
Fine.

But when he talks, and he talks quite a bit... all I can think of is you.
I hate to admit this, but...
I-it's more difficult than I imagined, your marrying another.
Is it too difficult for you?
Can you live like this?
I just want what's best for your reign.
If our situation becomes too complicated, too painful for either of us,
I'll simply disappear.
No.

I want you to stay.
Lord Bothwell.
What are you doing here?
The queen sent for me to return to court.
Even if she did, it's not the time for you to be distracting Mary with your presence.
Bothwell?
I am so sorry, Mary.
So that's Bothwell.
The man who despises me, and you invited him here.
After James left I was upset.
I needed someone I could trust.
I promised you that I would be by your side as a true husband, and you do this.
I'm sorry, Darnley.
Calm down;

I got your message.
Are you all right?
I'm...

Forgive me,
I should never have sent for you.
I disagree.
I'm trying to improve my...

And though I appreciate your coming,
I must ask you to leave.
You heard the queen, didn't you?
She asked you to leave.
Though I'm glad that we finally get to meet, since I've heard such a lot about the, what do you call it?
The Loyal Watchman.
You wrote Mary some very nasty letters about me, and yet here I am, ruler of Scotland.
So aren't you going to bow to your new king?
No.
You may wear the Scottish crown, Darnley, but you'll always be English by birth.
And I must confess, I don't like English people.
Bothwell.

If I could bathe these hills in English blood,
I would.

I would rather die.
Clearly.
Stop.

There will be no bloodshed in my court.
Very well.
By the queen's mercy, you may walk out of this castle with your life.
But as punishment for your defiance, you will never return.
Please, go.
That ball was long, brother.
I think it was in.
It's true, Charles.
The ball was in;

30-love.
It's all right, Charles, you can do this.
You're the king, after all.
Brilliant, strong, master of all you survey, and I adore you.
Well, she's a devoted subject.
You know, this is nice, watching your brothers play.
I'm not all that close to my siblings.
Well, you can certainly borrow mine.
Go on, Charles.
I wonder who's winning.
The match isn't over, Henri.
And it's my serve.

Here.
My nose.
Henri, what the hell was that?
I didn't mean to.

Charles, are you all right?
Get him to the infirmary.
You struck your brother with a tennis ball packed full of rocks.
I took the balls out of the bin and played.
I had no idea...

Narcisse saw you take this out of your own pocket.
You are purposefully undermining the king.
You're throwing parties, you're treating this court as if it's yours.
And I have seen the way you eye his young love, Nicole.
Despite your reassurances, you want his throne.
Leeza says he's not right in the head.
That I am needed.

What's Charles done?
He was born first.

That is how a monarchy works, how it endures.
Look at me.
This ambition that you carry endangers not only your brother's life, but your own.
Yes, Charles has struggled, but he has finally adjusted to the crown and he will fight for it.
So you will apologize to your brother, tonight at dinner, in front of the whole family.
Or what?

Spain wants me in power?
Leeza's not going to change her mind.
Perhaps I can change it for her.
This dirty little memento that you brought back,
The Goetia.
That was just a trinket, a joke.
Actually, it's heresy.
And neither Spain nor the Vatican take very kindly to heretics.
You would never accuse your own son of witchcraft.
I would if it stopped you from tearing this family apart, from inciting a civil war.
The lord chancellor will corroborate my accusation and you will be ruined.
Fine.
I'll apologize to Charles tonight.
Am I disturbing you?
No, come in.
I'm drafting a letter to Spain, telling them of our plans.
Well, I've received an update from my friend, Lord Barrett.
He and the Scottish soldiers have arrived safely in England, and are waiting to turn over the gold to my Catholic allies.
Well, that's good news.
Darnley, we should talk about what happened in the courtyard.
With Bothwell gone, I've put it out of my mind.
But there is something I'd like to discuss.
We are so close to getting everything we want.
Scotland and England,
Elizabeth no longer a threat.
And now we have a little one to consider, too.
Should anything ever happen to you, don't you want me to continue to protect Scotland?
I think we should reconsider the Crown Matrimonial.
No one would fight for our child's future as fiercely as I will.
Why are you so worried about something happening to me?
I would think you would protect me as you would your unborn child.
Of course I would!
You know I would.
Then why is it necessary?
Are you really going to continue to resist granting me what I deserve?
It is my blood, my allies that give you England.
As it stands, you are telling the whole world that you are the sole ruler of Scotland and that I am powerless!
And we come back to this again.
How many times must you disappoint me, Darnley?
You know, it's funny, but the truth is that because I am without power,
I am also without risk.
If Elizabeth should find that seal, you're the one in danger.
If the plan should go wrong, and those men never make it out of England alive, you alone would be implicated.
She would know that you were behind it, as well.
Would she?
If I confirmed your efforts to destroy her, allowing her to justifiably come after you... would she care?
Are you actually threatening your wife and queen when I am carrying our child?
That child exists solely to replace me.
I have given you everything that you wanted.
Now it's my turn.
Do not deny me this, or you will lose England.
You will lose everything that you have fought for your entire life.
The soup is delicious.
Such a medley of tastes.
I have something to say.
When I was fighting the Turks, we were vastly outnumbered at Dumar.
But I led us to victory after eating the very same soup, which I asked the cook to make.
It bolsters one's strength.
Henri.
Don't you have something to say to the king?
Right.
Charles, I'd like to apologize to you.
Did you hear that, Charles?
I'm truly sorry.
I forgot how traumatized you've been since your terrible kidnapping.
Henri!
How rattled you've been by the pressures of ruling.
Those whispers about your odd and ghastly habits...
Get out of my court!
I wish I could leave, but Spain wants me here.
Spain begged me to come.
What?

You're a liar!
You're a liar and you have no reason to stay here any longer!
Dinner is officially over!
Everybody should retire.

You might be my elder brother, but I am stronger than you in every way.
More's the pity, which is what they all feel for you.
Especially her.
Charles, would you please?

All right, well, if you haven't forgotten it, then what is it?
Would you just, um, give me a moment.
I don't know why you're following me, Rizzio.
Queen Mary needs to speak with you.
It's serious.
She told me to stay away.
Desperate times.
I need to abort the mission in England, but I can't abandon my men;
I need to return them home, along with the evidence Darnley is holding against me:
My royal seal.
I need you to retrieve it all.
It would be an unsanctioned mission.
If you were captured on English soil...
I know what happens to me.
I realize what I am asking of you.
But I have nowhere to turn and no one else I can trust.
You don't need anyone else.
You must find Darnley's ally, Lord Barrett.
Do you know where?

Darnley lied to me about their location.
But I do know someone who could help, Gideon Blackburn.
You want me to ask a former flame and advisor to Queen Elizabeth for information about men plotting against her?
It's because he cares for me and my cousin that he is likely to help.
I know we hardly know each other, and yet here I am, asking you to risk everything for me.
With or without your crown,
I would do anything for you.
Bothwell.
Be safe.
I was so excited for my family to be together again.
But we're a disaster.
Charles is damaged,
Henri's ruthless, and my mother is
Catherine de Medici.
Now that you've seen me and my family up close, you must be disappointed.
Still think I offer you a promising future?
I don't regret a thing.
And you are no disappointment.
Perhaps, when we start a family of our own, it can be different.
Luc.
You're a good man, but you should know that...
I'm not in love with you.
I'm not in love with you, either.
Yet.
Good.
Foolish Henri.
You had a chance to make amends tonight, but you squandered it.
Now I see no other option but to inform Spain that their prize pony dabbles in the occult.
Or you could do nothing.
Tell me, Lord Chancellor, is the king aware that you and his beloved Nicole are lovers?
Yes, I've noticed Nicole disappear shortly after you leave a room.
How do you think my brother would react if he knew?
Do you think blackmail will protect you?
How endearing.
But let me offer some advice:
Next time you threaten someone, make sure you have proof.
A theory is nothing more than a feather.
Tickles.
Don't worry, you're young.
You will get better at this.
That is outrageous!
Henri attacks his brother, the king, defies his own mother, and then he has the nerve to threaten you?
Well, enough is enough.

We will draft a letter to the Vatican.
I don't care if he is my child.
He wants to act like a young buck,
I will make him a doe.
Catherine.

We are not going to do anything to Henri.
That boy has earned my respect.
Narcisse...

For months trying to make Charles act like a king.
Well, Henri is a king.
Look at him.

By taking out his brother with a ball full with rocks?
It's cruel, but inventive.
Spanish warships are backing him.

I don't know what is.
Face it, Catherine,
Henri is the future.
What exactly are you suggesting?
Removing Charles by force?
Even if there's a peaceful way of transferring power, which there isn't,
Charles would not survive.
He will always be seen as a threat to Henri's reign.
He will be murdered one way or another.
And the entire Valois line will be vulnerable.
Maybe not.
If there was a strong king like Henri to replace him.
I like Charles, but... he is irreversibly damaged from whatever he endured at the hands of the Red Knights.
But it's too late.
For everyone.

Against Charles?
Against me?
I am on no one's side but my own.
But I am done with fighting a losing battle.
Spain wants Henri on the throne, and you do not have the power to save Charles.
Not anymore.
I am going to scream.
He invited me on a four-hour carriage ride through the country.

Very romantic.
He's a nice enough person, but four hours?
Gideon, you have to get me out of it.
I'm merely asking for tonight.
Fine.

Well, it better work.
I expect this important business to keep us occupied the entire night.
Lord Blackburn, you have an Italian visitor here to speak with you.
You see?
Works every time.
Lord Blackburn.

My associate and I apologize for arriving unannounced.

I'm not sure why you asked to speak with me, personally.
We have an Italian consulate which might be better suited to...
Actually, t-this is a Scottish matter, actually, one requiring your discretion.
My discretion?
Queen Mary is in danger.
And we wish to resolve the threat against her without divulging her weaknesses to Elizabeth.
I'm sorry, but I don't know you.
And I work for Queen Elizabeth, not Mary.
You nearly married the queen of Scots to protect her.
She said we could trust you to protect her life.
Was she mistaken?
I didn't get your associate's name.
Apologies for Lord Bothwell's tongue.
I think what he means is that Mary's situation is dire.
There is a noble here on English soil who would do her harm.

Yes, I know him, he's Darnley's man.
And a Catholic.

It is critical that we find Barrett before he carries out the deadly threat, because if something terrible should happen to Mary, we will all be responsible.
Gideon, will you help us?
I hate waiting.
Not knowing if the men I sent are alive or dead.
I hate it almost as much as I hate myself for trusting Darnley again.
I need to speak to the queen.

Greer has heard all about your threats.
You can speak freely.
Fine.
You need to make a decision.
If you still want England, then grant me the Crown Matrimonial.
Darnley, she needs rest in her condition...
This is between me and my wife.
And you are just stalling for time.
Now, the privy council are already assembled downstairs.
Sign the Crown Matrimonial, and we can make the announcement together.
I know how difficult this is for you.
I promise, you won't regret it.
This is the right thing to do, Mary.
For us.
For our child.
I will be a true king, and we will finally be equals.
I made you king.
But we will never be equals.
You just lost England.
I will warn Elizabeth against you, and when she gets word of your plot, she will come for you.
And she will take your head.
Do what you must, Darnley, but I will never sign.
We do not make our move on Elizabeth until King Darnley gives the order.

Lord Barrett, the wait is over.
Queen Mary says you're all to return to Scottish soil at once.
The mission has been aborted.
Stay where you are.
You're Queen Mary's secretary.
The Italian.

I serve King Darnley.
And until I hear from him, these men are not going anywhere.
Lord Barrett, let me explain the royal hierarchy?
You see, Darnley is only king consort, so he has no...
Maybe you didn't hear my friend.
The mission is aborted!
Now, where is Mary's seal?
I don't have it.
Lie to me again, and I will open you up, right here in your own house.
Gentlemen.

We're going home.
Lord Bothwell.
We found him spying on us.

You shouldn't have come here, Gideon.

Yes.

I just wanted to see for myself.
And how much did you see?
What do you want me to say?
Bothwell.
He's seen too much.

It's not your call, Bothwell, it's Queen Mary's.
You're right.
Take him with us.
Is something wrong, Your Majesty?
No.
I just sent for one of my servants to retrieve a blanket against the cold.
Did you find Gideon?
No, Your Majesty.
I've asked every servant on the grounds.
They say he left hours ago.
Any word on where he went?
No.
Mary?
It's all right, Gideon.
You're in Scotland.
Scotland?
No, no, no.
I've got to get back.

You have information that can't get back to my cousin.
Are you going to kill me, Mary?
I need you to understand that I am no longer pursuing Elizabeth's throne.
Really?

I can't worry about England anymore.
I have enemies here in Scotland who are seeking to destroy me and take my crown.
I thought my husband would... would be my ally, but... he is a danger to me.
Mary.

But you were planning to move on Elizabeth.
Soldiers, the gold...
She never needs to know.
It didn't happen.
It never happened, Gideon, because I stopped it.
Gideon, after all we've been through,
I must ask you to bend the rules one last time.
Promise me you're no longer a threat to her.
I swear it.
Release me, then, and Elizabeth will never hear of what you did.
You have my word.
Thank you.
You shouldn't have let him go.
He gave me his word.
And you gave yours.
Have you truly abandoned your pursuit of Elizabeth's throne?
I don't know.
I can't take England with Darnley.
And from here on out, I must do everything in my power to keep this disastrous marriage from ruining me.
You warned me not to marry.
Darnley and I should have listened to you.
I am so... tired of thinking about him.
You once told me that you weren't as strong as I thought.
But you are.
I am married.
And a queen.
And you can't afford to make a mistake.
It's a lovely day outside, you should get some fresh air.
You're upset.
Where's Nicole?
Doesn't she usually lift your spirits?
I don't know where she's gone.

Put his nonsense out of your mind.
No.

Do they really want Henri to take my place?
Charles, you know...
I am anointed by God.
And if Spain really wants to see the rightful.
King of France deposed, they'll have to kill me.
Charles.
I would never let that happen.
Ever.
You are my son.
And you are going to prove stronger than anyone ever imagined.
Next time you go drinking in Cornwall with your friends, you should tell me.
You just disappeared, and I thought...
What?
I thought maybe our relationship had grown too painful.
Elizabeth...
Just listen.
I just spent hours in a carriage with a man who is kind and handsome, and I kept thinking to myself, how can I spend a life with someone I don't love, when the man who means
everything to me will be kept at a distance?
And I realized I can't.
I'm not gonna marry him, Gideon.
But you have to.
What?
No, I don't.
I wasn't drinking in a tavern.
I was working with Mary.
Mary.
What happened?
There was a threat of a Catholic coup against you.
Mary asked me to help prevent it, and I... and I did.
Who else was involved?
Catholics who wanted to see Mary on your throne, but... but she called it off.
There was a threat of a coup forming?
Are you really going to continue to defend my rival?
No.

You were right.

Unless you share it with someone of their faith.
To stay alive, you must marry the archduke.
What's Bothwell doing here?
I banished him from court.
And I invited him back.
He's now my bodyguard.
And Rizzio is my new adviser.
How lovely for the three of you.
Why did you send for me, Mary?
Is it because you've rethought your decision?
If so, I am more than willing to do my part to move forward in peace.
Together, we can still take England.
No, Darnley.

My seal.
Safely retrieved from England.
Along with my gold and my countrymen.
Could we... speak alone?
No.
Mary, please.
We both know that things got out of hand last night, but believe me,
I am sorry.
It's too late for apologies, Darnley.
The threats you made can never be taken back.
And they will never be forgiven.
I lost my temper.
We both know I didn't mean what I said.
I-I would never betray you to Elizabeth.
We are finished, Darnley.
Well, that's it, then.
You win.
But I never really had a chance, did I?
I gave you every chance!
You're the one sitting on the throne.
I am your king in name only.
Not a real king, and I'm certainly not a real husband.
But, if that's what you want, then from now on, I will do nothing but drink and whore my way through Scotland.
Bothwell.

You can't arrest me,
Mary.

You didn't know.
All I have to do is say that that child isn't mine, and you and your heir will both pay the price.
You would condemn your own child?
And who would believe you?
Any man would.
You and your new bodyguard seem very close.
You're trying to take all my power away.
But I'm still your husband, and I still have the power to ruin you.
Get out of my sight.
Get out!
No.
