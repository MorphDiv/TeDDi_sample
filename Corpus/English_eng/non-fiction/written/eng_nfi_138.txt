One day, I decided to stop practicing gymnastics and started with parkour.
I got where I am today because I always did what my heart told me to do.
When I saw the Beast, I knew that my parkour skills would come in handy.
My name is Zigzag, and I am the Ultimate Beastmaster.
I work at BOPE.
The elite squad of the Military Police of Rio de Janeiro State.
It's very dangerous.
We are trained to face the scum of mankind:
the drug traffickers of Rio de Janeiro.
When the police have no other resources, we are called.
So, Guilherme, how did it go?
It wasn't my day.
Well, I put down real beasts.
I put down men of flesh and blood.
But I think Brazilian jujitsu will win this time.
This beautiful challenge brought us together:
my parents, my brother, and me.
It's all about us, and that vineyard represents the effort, the discipline, and values we have as a family.
Santiago's gone!
Mexico's hope!
I'm obsessed with perfection.
So I want to be good at what I do and be in good shape.
Go get 'em, Tiger!
I will now gut the Beast and turn it inside out.
I was a gymnast.
After that, I went to the circus.
I do CrossFit.
And this makes me a very powerful athlete.
I'm prepared to use my strength, run, hang, whatever it takes.
Good job, Brazil!
I don't want to see.
Oy, Phelipe!
By participating in this contest,
I'd like to show off my skills.
To show I'm a man.
This is for you.
A key point to win in this contest is to beat back your fear.
He fell!
Go!
Like a pro!
So close!
If he has a bad performance, we will go to the Germans' booth.
We passed them.
Our Brazilian colleagues.
Marco Cerullo, Germany, is number one.
Marco Cerullo, Germany, is number one.
They know how to dance and shake their ass...
She has the nickname Zigzag.
No!
But she was really fast.
I acted like a fool making fun of the Germans.
And we lost to Germany... again!
I cannot stand losing to Germany.
C'mon, Silke!
Silke Sollfrank!
We're all part of Silke's run.
I'm proud to be 100% Mexican.
I was the first Mexican to win a medal in a World Cup.
I feel gymnastics has given me the tools I need to face the Beast.
His Olympic dreams vanished,
I'm not competing against them, just myself.
I wanted to finish it.
By becoming the Ultimate Beastmaster,
I'd like to tell the world that the most important thing is to constantly continue challenging yourself.
He fell!
Here, it seems he threw in the towel.
I'm a CrossFit coach.
Well, I was on the national team.
I was a weightlifter for Korea and had that training for the Olympics and Asian Games.
That's it!
All that weightlifting now pays off!
Wow, Level 2 is way harder.
Much, much, much harder.
I was raised by my mother and my aunt.
My mother always wanted me to follow the path of sports.
If I win, and I will win, that $10,000 will not be for me.
It will be for my mother and my aunt.
It's the real-life video game.
We made fun of the Americans saying that he was better and...
Rafinha and I are hoping he will get through this first phase.
This way he will eliminate the American, and we can make fun of Terry Crews.
Let's go, Marco!
Come on, Marco!
He is exhausted.
I'm way out of my comfort zone.
I've never done these obstacles before.
This is the time to let my abilities act.
Of course, the gymnastics on display.
Santi, my man!
We got lost in that one and got scared to death.
That was slippery.
And shaky, which changes everything.
I believe the key to victory here is measuring your jump well and following through calmly.
What's the matter, Shimofuji?
The jump didn't quite go the way I wanted it to.
My footing kind of gave way.
What a pity!
While I was a coach, the members told me that there was nothing I couldn't do.
So everything expects me to win.
A lot of pressure.
They all cheer for me.
Past the Ejector!
He was so good.
His arms gave out.
I know.
I was gonna do this.
I'm not doing Taekwondo enough.
I should practice it more often.
Level 3 will be quite challenging, but I am the only girl to come this far.
I did really well.
I don't have anything to lose.
Mexico!
Germany!
Silke Sollfrank flies through this level.
Silke wins over the heart of the audience.
Extraction is up next.
She got the pole!
She has to use that momentum to reach the other pole.
Hold on!
No!
Are you disappointed?
We all took you into our hearts.
In physical aspects, I was a weightlifter.
Stamina, strength and power...
I think I'm the best in those.
I feel gymnastics has given me the tools I need to face the Beast.
To raise Mexico's flag, to compete in its name... fills me with pride and happiness.
Beast, you've met your match.
Ultimate Beastmaster.
Korea, I can do it!
Let's go, Santiago!
Mexico!
Come on, buddy!
Wow, it's really...
It's amazing.
I never expected it to be this spectacular.
It was really fun and I won't forget about this.
I made good friends, and Santiago was great, too.
