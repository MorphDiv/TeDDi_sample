Previously on Pure.
I'm coming back, Noah Funk, and when I do,
I will hurt you in every way I know how.
All the charges against the Mennonites have been dropped.
So if you can still find your own badge, I want it on my desk.
I keep my sketches in my room so my dad doesn't realize who's been tagging the walls all over town.
It's working.
Don't ask me how, but this shit is now 98.5% pure.
- What is going on up there?

I want to make a trade.
My freedom for the new delivery system.
You come and I will show you how to do this new process.
Nee.

A day after tomorrow, there will be a plane waiting at the airstrip outside of Chatham.
These are my terms.
(eerie music)
(relieved sigh)
What is that?
"V," which stands for?
No, all these notes.
Noah goes here.
Abel goes there.
(Noah sighs.)
- These are Bronco's notes.

Where did all this come from?
I don't know.
Na oba!
And now, Voss wants me to come to Mexico.
With the chemist.

She left right after the milking.

- Noah.

Uh... times have been hard for the Edentaler in Mexico... drought, crime... which means, uh...
They have to sell everything.
It's unfortunate, but there is plenty of valuable equipment up for auction.
And better they sell to us than take pennies on the dollar from some Auslander auctioneer.
Which is why your uncle and I are going on a trip.
ISAAC:

Jo.

I promise we'll be here for your baptism.
- Brooda?

Can I have a word with you, please?
The whole point was to bring Voss here, to get him on the wire here, to arrest him here!

He wants to see the process there, in Mexico.

Oh, so now I'm just another lie of yours?
You're going to go to your death in Mexico, so why not bring your useless Brooda too?
I'm off the drugs now.
I know.

I need you, Brooda.
The only way we can do this is together.
We have to trust in God.
That He has a plan.
It's not God I'm worried about.

Jo.

Huh?

OK, because of my former boss,
Voss knows that I'm on to him.
The good news is, though, he doesn't know that we're a team and that I'm speaking to the D.E.A.
So we just stick with the game plan.
You get him on a wire talking business.
You know he's gonna check us, right?
- Voss is not stupid!

OK?
Look, I suppose you two are not exactly the people police would hire as criminal informants.
That's right.

Just get him on a wire and leave the law to me, OK?
Let's do this.
(engine revving up)
Hello.
I am a good worker.
I can clean for you.
Just for a place to sleep.
I got eight rooms to go.

You keep the doors locked and tell the children, all of them.

And you'll need help.
Someone we trust.
- Isaac can't do the chores by himself...

The baptism.
Promise me he'll be baptized.
Noah, I will take care of it.
When I return, we will go back to the old ways.
As God intends.
OK.

Hi, I'm Agent O'Reilly.
I'm looking for a Detective Novak.

Do you mind showing my son some ID?
Otherwise, he's not gonna let me out of here.
Sure.
Don't worry.

I'll be in the car.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah.
I'm only gonna be gone a couple of days.
Is this about Tina and her family?
I need you to stay away from them for a while, OK?
Until the dust settles.
Here's some cash for some groceries.

Noah, Anna, this is Agent O'Reilly.
Mrs. Funk.

I just want to say "thank you,"

It takes a lot of courage to do something like this.
No.

Not courage.
This is my brother Abel.
Nice to meet you.
And this is Ezekiel?
Nice to meet you, Ezekiel.
Ezekiel does not speak much English.
Right.
Ezekiel has a uncle in Mexico,
Jonas Janzen.

- in Juarez.

Social services.
He wants his nephew back and, according to the law, we gotta give him back.

My Brooda stood up to the Epps to save his life.
We all did.

I appreciate that, but his uncle has no ties to Voss or the drug trade.

He's opportunistic

Can't pay 'em all off.
I have some friends down there who would love dearly to nail his hide to the wall.
Noticing anything different about your bible?
Oh no, this is not my bible;
this is the one Bronco found near the Janzen's car.
There's a listening device and GPS glued on the cover.
The antenna is sewn into the stitching of the spine.
It's voice activated, omnidirectional.

I'll go to Special Ops who'll go to Federales who will hit Eli so hard, there'll be nothing left but his smoking boots.
If something happens to us, uh, who will look after our family?
- Listen, if anything happen...

OK?

Policewoman.
- Agent.

I need you all to realize that this is very dangerous, OK?
But if anyone can get him to talk business, it's you.

Don't try to lead him.

Justina's been so busy since I went away.
You will dig her a new garden;

I'm not sitting this out, Agent O'Reilly.
You had Voss cornered on the second floor of a farmhouse in a place where people escape in buggies.
So how exactly did he get away?
You weren't there so you don't know.
You know, Voss depends on cops like you to stay in business.
Overconfident and underprepared.
Not nearly as smart or brave as they like to think they are.
If I get another shot at taking down Voss,
I don't want you going through that door with me.

Once you have the cocaine out for delivery in the milk trucks, you release me and my family from your service, Jo?
Do you think I became Bauss by bargaining with men that already belong to me?
I belong to God.
You can't take that from me.
After everything that you've done, Pradja Funk, and everything that you will do, you still believe God will embrace you in his infinite love?
Do what you want with me, but let Abel go,
let my family go back to a plain life.
Come with me.

Our bishop doesn't like my business, so they've all been excommunicated.
They can't receive communion, but I told them you could do it.

We both know those who have been set back cannot join the Lord's Supper.
Which is why I'm asking you to do it, Pradjda.
Communion service for the excommunicated is meaningless.
Not to them.
Any one of these righteous men so eager to remember the blood of Christ would not hesitate to shed yours or your family's if I give the word.
They've killed for me before, they will again.
