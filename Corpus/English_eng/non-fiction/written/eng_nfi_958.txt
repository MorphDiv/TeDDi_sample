Thank you, Tammy.
You're welcome.
Patched in through the office, it's a Colonel Davis for you at the Pentagon.
Urgent.
Try to keep your voice down.
What?
Hello?
Colonel?
What have you got?
I don't appreciate your language one bit, Colonel.
Oh, a place.
Buckhorn.
Buckhorn, South Dakota.
West South Dakota.
Well, by golly, we're over east South Dakota right now.
Take this down.
Hold on.
Capital K, small N, small O, small X,
Knox.
Lieutenant Knox.
Buckhorn Police Department.
All right.
Thank you, Colonel.
Hey, partner.
We was expecting you last night.
Looks like you've been spilling.
Who owns this establishment?
Farmers.
Where are they?
Oh, they're sleeping out back.
What you need?
A couple clean phones.
And something for this.
Well, fuck that.
I'll get you some real nice puppies and biscuits.
Hey, Chantal.
Boss man's here.
Grab the kit.
Is he hurt?
Shit.
We was waiting for you all night.
Where'd they get you?
Ooh.
Looks like you was lucky.
I'll get the kit.
Go on inside.
Rather than return directly to Philadelphia, would you mind if we made a short trip to Buckhorn, South Dakota?
It's quite important.
Fuck you, Gordon.

This is important, and it could be of interest to you, Diane.
An old case involving a man
Agent Cooper once knew.
The Blue Rose case.
Yes.
Coming up.
Got to talk to the pilot first.
There's been a change of plan.
We're going over to Buckhorn, South Dakota.
I know.
I know.

Agent Preston.
Good.
Yes, I understand.

It's Warden Murphy.
Warden Murphy?
Your man Cooper escaped.
What?
How the hell did that happen?
Cooper flew the coop.
Did you do it?
Not yet.
Better be done next time I call.
Roger, come in here.
How's that, boss?
It's real good, Hutch.
All right.
I want you to kill a warden within the next two days.
A warden?
All right.
You want Chantal to mess with him before I kill him?
He'll sing for me.
Whatever you want.
Then I got a doubleheader for you in Vegas.
Oh, let's play two.
I'll text you details after you do the warden.
Remember this.
Warden Murphy, Yankton Federal Prison.
Kill him at home, at work, or on the way.
Okay.
Hey, Chantal, give the boss man a wet one.
I wish it was more.
I'll take a rain check.
You got it, sweetheart.
Kill that phone.
And clear out of this place.
The main road is that way.
He ever give any problems?
No, I never had any trouble with Dougie at all.
He's a... solid citizen.
So you can't think of any reason why someone would try to kill him.
Not off the top of my head.
Of course, in the insurance business, folks have been known to hold a grudge if things don't go their way.
It's usually about money, Bushnell.
Pure and simple.
Nobody needs more reason than that.
So what's his background?
How long has he been with you?
Twelve years now.
He's a good worker.
He's slow, steady.
Little more emphasis on the "slow."
Dougie had a car accident, as I recall, not long before he came to work for me.
Every once in a while, he shows some lingering effects.
His wife can talk to that better than I can.
Well... we appreciate you coming down, Bushnell.
Well, I really appreciate your help.
Damn strange business.
First his car blows up, and then somebody tries to kill him.
We'll get back to you as soon as we have something.
Dougie, you can take the rest of the day off.
Well, that's great, because I can take him to the doctor.
Starting tomorrow, you and I are gonna work together and get some answers.
Answers.
So get this.
There is nothing, and I mean nothing, on our Mr. Douglas Jones prior to 1997.
You're shitting me.
No driver's license.
No passport.

Class records.

No birth certificate.
I'll be damned.
Witness protection?
Maybe.
You still got that guy at Justice?
I'll run it by him.
Did you get that taillight fixed?
To the tune of 239 bucks for a fuckin' taillight.
Must be a beauty.
Remember the Australian guy with the pliers?
Should we talk to him again?
It's like talking to a dog.
And she does all the barking.
I have an idea.
Brought you a fresh one, Mr. Jones.
Can I get you one too, ma'am?
Oh, no, thanks, but thanks for bringing one for Dougie.

Got ya.
Hey, Fuscos?
Yes?
Sergeant.
Just in time.
Prints and DNA, please.
Hey, I was just coming to tell you that those palm prints came back off that gun.
Our old friend Ike the Spike... and we just got a 20 on him at an off-Strip motel.
Ike the Spike finally fucked himself.
Hey, let's join the fun.
Sarge, let the Joneses go.
I got to log this first.
All right.
Hey, look.
The right one?
Yeah, right.
Look, there's a scratch right there, buddy.
All right, let's go.
Message for JT.
Been trying your cell.
No luck, so trying this line.
Here's the message.
No cigar.
Taking medical leave.
Oh, please tell me he's still here.
Is he in there?
All right, towards me.
He's coming your way.
Ike, you're under arrest for attempted murder.
We have your palm print.
As a matter of fact, Ike, we have your whole palm.
Andy, I really love the beige chair.
And, Lucy, I really love the red chair.
And I really love the beige chair, Andy.
I'm sorry, pumpkin.
You can get the beige chair.
Mary, what are you doing?
Who let him out?
Where is he?
Johnny!
Johnny, where are you?
Johnny!
Johnny.
Johnny!
Johnny!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Johnny.
Ma?
Hey, Bobby, what's up?
- You want some coffee?

I'm here with the fellas.
We need to talk to you.
I need to ask you some questions.
Okay.
Come on in, fellas.
Mrs. Briggs.
Ma'am.
Gentlemen.
We're here to talk to you about Agent Cooper's visit with the Major the day...
The day before Garland died.
Yes.
All right, listen to me.
Right after Agent Cooper left that day,
Garland pulled me aside, and he said that one day... our son Bobby, and Hawk, and Sheriff Truman...
I didn't know it would be this Sheriff Truman.
He said that they would come and ask me about Special Agent Dale Cooper.
He squeezed my shoulders when he told me this.
I tried to ask him what it was about, but he... he...
He wouldn't say any more.
He just said,
"When they come to ask you about Agent Cooper, you give them this."
And now you're here.
Would you fellas like some coffee?
- No, no.

Thank you.
All right.
Come with me.
This is the chair.
I can't believe this day has come.
Watch right here.
Bobby, when your father told me this, you were a very long way from where you are today.
Somehow, he knew that it would all turn out well.
He saw this life for you.
Your father never lost faith in you.
Well, fellas, let's have that coffee.
- Yeah.

- Yeah?

Okay.
- Yes.

The waiting room.
They're right behind us.
Ah.
- Lieutenant Knox.

Macklay.
Diane.
I'm not in the mood to see a dead body this morning.
I'll just wait for you guys here.
I'm sorry, ma'am, you can't smoke here.
It's a fucking morgue!
This way.
Fuckin' pansies.
Detective Macklay handled the case when it came in.
He'll brief you on background.
William Hastings was having an affair with the local librarian, Ruth Davenport.
Now, Davenport's head was found atop the headless body of your Major Briggs.
Once we took Hastings into custody, his wife was murdered in their house, apparently by their lawyer, a man named George Bouncer, who is now also in custody.
And the next day,
Hastings' secretary died in a car explosion.
What happens in season two?
Apologies in advance for Albert.
Well, this is your Major Briggs.
It turns out that William Hastings, along with the help of Ruth the librarian, was researching and publishing some strange little blog about some alternate dimension.
This from the principal of your local high school.
Not to mention, marble champion of the sixth grade.
When did he lose his marbles?
When the dog got his cat's-eyes.
About one week ago, Hastings ended his blog entry with this cryptic sentence:
"Today we finally entered what we call the Zone, and we met the Major."
This is the body of a man in his 40s.
Yes.
Albert.
Let's think out loud.
Major Briggs would have been 72.
As you know, we thought he died in a fire in that government facility outside Twin Peaks... 25 years ago.
About the age this man is now.
Well, consider this.
Cooper knew Briggs.
Cooper was around Briggs 25 years ago, and now, Cooper shows up in this neck of the woods.
On the loose in this neck of the woods.
Right.
And I found this in his stomach.
It... it's inscribed.
It says, "To Dougie", love, Janey-E."
We need to speak with this William Hastings.
Go away!
Hmm, hmm, hmm.
Hey, Lucy.
Sheriff Truman, I'm not here.
I'm on my lunch break.
Oh, Sheriff.

No lunch in the conference room, Chad.
I know, but... you guys have donuts and coffee in here all the time.
Chad, take your lunch to the lunchroom.
Sure thing.
No problem, Sheriff.
Sorry.
Won't happen again.
Oh, jeez.
Oh, come on.
Could you get the door?
Little help here?
Bobby, open the window.
Yeah.
No seams.
No openings.
How the heck are you supposed to open this thing?
Maybe there's a hidden button somewhere.
I don't see any hidden button.
What are you smiling at?
I know how to open that.
My dad brought one home one night.
You having fun with us, Bobby?
Yeah, sort of.
Go for it.
We got to go back outside.
Outside?
Yeah, we got to go back outside.
Okay.
What the...
Shh.
"Two hundred fifty-three yards"
east of Jack Rabbit's Palace.
Before leaving Jack Rabbit's Palace, put some soil from that area "in your pocket."
And two dates.
And a time.
Same time.

That's two days from now, and the day after.
Jack Rabbit's Palace?
I never heard of such a place.
He did it again.
Wow.
What?
What is it, Bobby?
I know exactly where Jack Rabbit's Palace is.
My dad, when I was a little kid, he took me to this place.
It was near where our station used to be.
It was our make-believe world, you know, where we made up stories.
I was the one who named it Jack Rabbit's Palace.
He saw all this.
Whatever this is.
That's my dad.
We'll go up there two days from now, and you can lead the way, just as your dad wanted.
Wait a minute.
There's something else.
"COOPER/COOPER."
Two Coopers.
We came out to join you, Diane, while Albert's indisposed.
Gordon.
Whoa.
We used to smoke together, way back when.
You remember?
Yeah, we sure did, Gordon.
We sure did.
Thanks, Diane.
You don't want to finish it off?
Tammy.
Hello, Mr. Hastings.
I'm Agent Tammy Preston of the FBI.
Oh, God, the FBI.
Mr. Hastings,
I'm also recording our conversation.
Okay.
Would you state your name and age for the record?
William Hastings.

Mr. Hastings, are you the author of an online journal or blog entitled The Search for the Zone?
Uh-huh.

What sort of things do you write about?
Different things.
Approximately two weeks ago, did you write an entry about encountering what you described as an alternate reality?
A different dimension.
Yes, but it's real.
It's all real.
How long have you been interested in this subject, Mr. Hastings?
Many years.
I do...

But this time, you wrote that you actually found and entered such a place.

And that while in this place, you wrote, and I quote,
"We met the Major."
Yeah.

You see, Ruth was very good at uncovering hidden records.
And she had indications that if we went to a certain place at a certain time, we would enter the dimension and make contact with a certain person.
And so we went there.
And that's where you found the Major.
He was hiding there, or "hibernating," as he said.
And other people may...
Were maybe gonna find him, and he wanted to go to a different place, and so he asked us to get him numbers.
Important numbers.
Coordinates.
And we found them in the place he told us to go, a secure military database.
Do you still have those coordinates?
No, Ruth had them.
She wrote 'em on her hand, though, so that she wouldn't forget.
Sorry.
What happened then, William?
We brought him back the numbers last Thursday.
And then something terrible happened.
These others...
These others came in, and they grabbed me by the neck, and they pushed...

They said, "What's your wife's name?
What's your wife's name?"
"Phyllis," I said.
I didn't kill Ruth.
I didn't kill her.
You... you have to believe me.
I loved her.
This is all my fault.
This is all my fault.
It never should have happened.
William, are any of these six photographs I'm showing you the man you call the Major?
That's the Major.
Draw a circle around the photo of the man you call the Major.
Sign and date it.
Yes, ma'am.
Can you tell me what happened?
We gave him the numbers.
And he started to float up and he said some words.
"Cooper.

Right before his head disappeared.
It was something like no one has ever seen before.
I've never seen anything like it.
I...

I've never read anything like it.
You don't know.

It was... he...
He...
It was beautiful.
And then Ruth was dead.
It was so terrible, and I had...

And then... and then I woke up, and I was in...

I was in my home.
Did the Major kill Ruth?
No, there were so many people there.
You have to believe me.
Please, I didn't kill Ruth.
I loved her.

I don't know what is happening to me.
Why can't you help me, please?
Please.
We were so happy together.
We were gonna go to the Bahamas.
We were gonna... scuba dive and drink mixed drinks on the beach.
And we were gonna soak up the sun.
And look at the beautiful sunsets.
She said to me...

Let's just do it.
Let's go to the Bahamas.
"Let's go scuba diving."
I want to go scuba diving.
Fruitcake, anyone?
Hmm.
Security couldn't find anything?
Mm-mm.
They checked everywhere.
Hmm.
It seems to be loudest here.
- Mm-hmm.

It's, um... it's kind of a mesmerizing tone.
Yes.
The ring out of a monastery bell has the same quality.
Or the... hmm.
Otherworldly.
Beverly.
I can't do this.
I don't know why it is.
You're a good man, Ben.
You know that zebra's out again?
Uh... haven't seen you in a while.
I got another job.
Oh, yeah?
What happened?
I got fired.
That fucker fired me.
That's fucked.
How come?
I came in high a couple times, I guess.
You guess?
Yeah.
Fuck.
I can't remember.
You know what I mean.

I mean, I did the fucking work.
Like, how can you fuck up serving burgers, you know what I mean?
Totally.
I got some kind of wicked rash.
So where are you working now?
Across the fucking street, serving burgers.
Oh, shit.

Have you seen that penguin?
Have I... what?
You know, the penguin.
Yep.
