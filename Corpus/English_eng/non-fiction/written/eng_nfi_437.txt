I was hoping we could talk.
Yeah, I gotta go.

The Monfell Shipping Center has been non-operational for the last six months.
Since its closure, it's become a favorite location for São Paulo Locos to conduct business.
They've come and gone as they please with minimal resistance.
That ends today.
Late last night, a shipping container arrived at Monfell from Bogotá.
Due to the amount of chatter DEA believes this could be their largest shipment of contraband to date.
The source couldn't identify exactly what came in.
So whether it's money, arms, or the ghost of Pablo Escobar, be ready.
Secure the scene, help find the container.
Once you've done that, you all can go enjoy your holiday.
HALL:

It's a whole thing.
- How about you?

- You should come over.

Yeah.

Not me.

Sorry to ruin your holiday.
Aw, you ruin every day, El.

Don't call me "El."
When did this come down?
Got the call from DEA at 2.

HALL:

Yeah.
Don't get that big brain of yours thinking.

- Inspiring as always.

Let's go.
Ward?

WARD:

- Yeah, it's pretty.

CHU:

Why don't you come to the beach later?

No, I got plans.
BENSON:

- Why would she go to your party?

Just entering my prime.
Yo, I'm not doing anything.

Remember what happened last time you came?
- No.

ALL:

HALL:

Simmer down.
A little calm-before-the-storm levity.
There's not gonna be a storm.
- What makes you say that?

We've been letting them do a few scores...
- ...and now they feel safe.

Well, I guess we got all dolled up for nothing.
[♪♪♪]
HALL [OVER RADIO]:

We go in heavy, stay frosty.
Watch each other's backs stick to the plan, stay tight.
Let's do this.
[♪♪♪]
CHU:

That was sloppy, Chu.
All, we have guard one on lockdown.

HALL:

WARD:

We got another guard on the east-side stairwell.
Hands.

WEIR:

Knees.
How many others are there?
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
Sofi, anything?
Nothing.

- I don't see any containers.

Come on, do you have to do that?
Sorry.
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
You sure this is the right place?
This is the place.
Let's go.
- Jackpot.

Outside.

Copy.

Everyone else, meet at the shipping container.
Copy that.
Look to your left.
Copy.

I've got 10 to 12 hostiles coming in hot from inside the warehouse.
Take cover.

GUTIERREZ:

Cover me.
- You okay?

I got you covered.

[GRUNTING]
[GROANING]
PHIL:

[GRUNTS]
Stay down.

Are you hit?
Just got the vest.
[SCREAMS]
- Cover.

[BONE CRACKS THEN MAN SCREAMS]
Now you're both being sloppy.
You owe me a beer.
[GROANS]
DIEGO:

DIEGO:

- My arm!

DIEGO:

What the fuck?
It's a fucking suicide vest.
- What are you wearing this for?

WARD:

What the fuck?
PHOENIX:

BENSON:

Fuck.

[♪♪♪]
No.
I got Phoenix.

[PHOENIX GRUNTS]
I got you.
"It's not gonna be a storm."
Cover!
[♪♪♪]
Cut him down.
HALL:

That's not our problem anymore.
All right, fine.
- Let me go.

He won't shut up, and the guy we cut down's not talking.
What'd Dwyer say?
She's sending a wagon.
What?
- Why?

- I thought this was DEA.

She can't get ahold of brass.
WARD:

Till she does, we hang onto them.
We should keep them.

Fuck them all.

- They should defer to us.

GUTIERREZ:

LARS:

It was, in fact, the North that did this.
The South would have loved to have counted each slave twice and the North, rightly so didn't believe that the slaves that didn't have the right to vote should count equally to those that did.
That would've given the South more power to put their influence on the North.
And what's your point?
I thought we were chatting.
[BUZZING]
Yes?
MAN [IN ALTERED VOICE]:

It's not that far.

Just listen.
Diego fucked up.
He lost Scorpion.
And you have him?
[OVER SPEAKERPHONE] Not that simple.
But I know where he is and how to get him.
Fifty million.
We both know he's worth 10 times that.
I don't think this is a game you wanna play.
- You don't know who you're dealing...

...with.
Two hundred years ago, it was so much easier to buy a human being.
- Check out his story.

It's fucking Scorpion.
I don't wanna lose him.
Not now.

[♪♪♪]
HALL:

We're short-handed.

Got it, commander.
[DIEGO SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
- My arm!

Move.
[SIGHS]
I thought I made myself clear.
We got jumped, and not by some...
You say that, and all I hear is you weren't prepared.
What happened?

What was the DEA onto?
- What do you mean?

- Clearly, they weren't honest with us.

They acted on a tip that 500 million in product was moving through Monfell.
Ah.

A guy in a box.
Protected by heavily armed São Paulo Locos soldiers...
Their tip was wrong.

That doesn't make them fucking liars.
So, what do we do now?
I have calls in.

Until we get answers, we sit tight.
- Fuck that.

You're gonna leave them be.
- They're the feds' problem.

Phil is dead.

Right now all I'm thinking about is what I'm gonna tell his family.
[♪♪♪]
MR. MAGOO [ON TV]:

Fine.
Lobby, please.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Watch those sudden stops, boy.
Somebody could get hurt.
It's a big place.
And they've got their Christmas decorations up already.
LARS:

Mr. C. I wasn't, um....
Make yourselves at home.
Welcome.
MR. MAGOO:

Could take a nasty fall from a loose board.
Oh, I just....
Lord help the whole thing.
Nicholas.

Yes, yes.

I did.

So I was able to tap into a security camera across from the shipping center.
Where did they take him?
S.W.A.T.'s got him back at their place.
It's their renovated facility in the middle of nowhere.
- Sounds like the paint isn't even dry yet.

I heard it on my police scanner.
LARS:

Now can you trace the number that called this phone?
Find out who and where they are?
- I can try.

Uh, of course.

DWYER:

He was a hero.
Yes.
You have my word.
Whoever's responsible for this is gonna pay.
HALL [OVER PHONE]:

No, I understand.

No, don't do that.
- You okay?

Travis?
Yeah?
I'm really sorry.
I love you.
It's our turn to host the holiday barbecue so Carley's at home making the food for 22 kids and their parents.
- What's up?

GUTIERREZ:

She's not mad at me.
Sorry, man, I'm on her side.
What...?

Besides, you can't be on her side.

That's a brotherhood.
Yeah, but Carley's like my sister.
- And sisterhood trumps brotherhood...

Look you decided before you got married that you only wanted one kid.
Yeah.

But out of the blue, you say you want another kid.
Yeah, I said maybe we could think about having another kid...
- ...then it became...

You wanna have another baby that she'll have to carry for nine months.
She's gonna have to walk away from work after all she's accomplished.
She's gonna wake up 10 times a night to feed and change the kid because you're always off doing this.
- She heard all that with "maybe"?

ELSON:

No, no, no, dude.

I don't know.

Have you ever seen it?
Yeah, I tried that.

Oh, are you kidding me?
- I had that in the queue.

I gotta go.
Please don't touch that.
What do you got?
Our friend Diego is a bad, bad dude.
From Honduras, okay?
Joined the São Paulo Locos, known as the S.P.L., when he was 6.
He's now a lieutenant.
- Okay.

Is that what we're calling him?
Yeah, for now.
Nada on him.

What about other databases?
- Such as?

I don't have clearance to tap those.
But you could probably do it without clearance, right?
Are you asking me or telling?
There's no way a guy protected by S.P.L.'s best is a ghost.
Just find out who he is.
You got it, boss.
Hey, put Diego in room one.
- Get him to talk, have Ward listen.

I'm gonna go talk to Scorpion.
Dwyer's gonna lose her shit.
Let me worry about Dwyer.
[MUMBLING IN SPANISH]
[DOOR BUZZES]
Hey, Diego.

You broke my fucking arm.
I gave you the choice to have your arm broken or not.
You chose poorly.
Now, explain something to me.
Why would a lieutenant be put on babysitting duty?
Did they demote you, Diego?
Go fuck yourself, puta.
- Who's the man in the box?

[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
That's who he is.

Want something to drink?
You need a medic.

Am I being charged with a crime?
That depends.
- On?

Have you asked Diego who I am?
[MUMBLING IN SPANISH]
What's that?
He said that this was going to happen.
- Who said...?

Who would escape?

You're all fucking dead.

You tell them I did this, okay?
You tell them I did this.
Hey, stop.
Diego, stop!

I need some help in here.
Perhaps you should attend to that.
GUTIERREZ:

Oh, God.
What the fuck happened?
WARD:

HALL:

Fuck me.
[DOOR BUZZES]
Who the fuck are you?
You have blood on your hands.
Answer the question.
Did you kill him?
No.
He killed himself.
Cracked his skull wide open.
We do not have much time.
I'm not asking again.
What is important is that you listen.
You may think the events of today were in error but I assure you, my friend, they were not.
You better start answering my questions.
I have information in my head worth billions of dollars.
What kind of information?
The kind that can set the world on fire.
Jesus Christ, enough with the fucking riddles.
Fine.

Very soon, you will be told that officers from a federal agency are here to take me into custody.
They are not what they say they are.
Do not let these men take me.
Do this, and I will help you to survive what is coming next.
- FBI's here for him now.

I told you I had calls in.
We're handing him over, so we can all go home.
- Did they say who he was?

Someone they've been after for a while.
- Where are they?

I'll take care of it.
I'll bring them to him, pass him off.
Gentlemen, you're here for the prisoner.
Commander Hall.

- Sorry for the delay.

We appreciate you hanging on to our guy.
Right this way.
That's funny, I thought all you FBI guys used Berettas.
These are our personal weapons.
- On the job?

So, what'd this guy do to get on your database, anyway?
- Terrorist stuff.

"Terrorist stuff." What's his name?
Come on.

Well, look, it's clear you guys aren't FBI, so no fooling.
Who are you?
Just hand the prisoner over.
Not until I get some answers.
[♪♪♪]
[GUNSHOT]
You are dead, motherfucker.
- Drop the knife now!

CHU:

Knees.
- You all right, commander?

- Got him?

Commander?
Commander.
[♪♪♪]
[GUN COCKS]
[♪♪♪]
You trust me now?
[DOOR BUZZES]
Hooks.
Hands on your head.
Let's go.
- You all right, commander?

WARD:

[FRANKLIN CACKLING]
Keys, cowboy.
I'm going to enjoy watching you die.
Shut the fuck up.
Everything happened the way he said.
Our mystery man's not even in the FBI's database.
Wait.

You hacked the FBI database?
Just a bit.
Look, on the way to the shipping center I made a crack to Weir about this being the calm before the storm and he said there wasn't gonna be a storm.
I don't think they were expecting any resistance...
- ...which is odd, don't you think?

- There is a protocol we need to follow...

This isn't the end of it.
We lost enough guys today.

You're a cop, right?

What does your gut tell you?
Let's see what he has to say.
HALL:

He actually just tried to kill me to get to you.
I've never seen him before, but I know more like him will be coming.
- Many more.

That is for your protection.
- The less you know....

My guess is you're Special Ops.
You've been tortured, from the looks of it, more than once.
You could have easily escaped our compound, but you chose not to.
Why?
You need our protection because everyone and their mother's coming after you because what you know could cause blowback.
It is far more complicated than that.
Fill me in here.

Because I believe you when you say more like him are coming.
But you're gonna have to square-up with me if you want us to do more than just turn you over.
You were correct about Special Ops but that was only in the beginning.
I quickly realized that information was true power.
- So you're a spy.

[COMPUTER WHIRRING]
Hm.
SIMONE:

NICHOLAS:

I don't have a "who" but I have where the call originated from.
Okay.

I made a mistake in Bogotá.
So why'd they capture you?

To facilitate my sale.
DWYER:

S.P.L. knows their lane.

No, but others do.
- Who, then?

But one thing I am sure of:
Someone from your team is involved.
LARS:

Show me who we're up against.
[♪♪♪]
Where you going, Travis?
- Commander?

Where?
Not alone.

HALL:

- Just me.

- That doesn't make any sense.

If I tell you where I'm going...
- ...they could get it out of you.

They're coming for him, Sof and they're not gonna stop.
[♪♪♪]
I won't let another person I care about die today.
If they know he's here, they could be watching the compound, and...
I'll have Elson review the area.
Thanks.
[KEYS JINGLING]
I'm moving you.
Moving me will not keep them from coming for me.
No, but it'll keep them from my team and that's my priority.
[SIGHS]
It's how it's gotta be.
[♪♪♪]
Yo, commander, what's going on?
Hey.

What do you mean, "out"?
[PHONE BUZZING]
It's him.
Hello?
MAN [IN ALTERED VOICE]:

How we looking?
Yeah, yeah.

GUTIERREZ:

ELSON:

That has been bugging me all day.
SNIPER:

Did you disable the camera that shows our sniper?
What I did was record footage before he got there and just have it playing back on a continuous loop.
A simple "yes" would suffice.
GUTIERREZ:

Yes.
- Think they're watching?

Travis, stop!
What are you doing?
You said you didn't want anyone else to die.
Yeah, and that included you.
I'll radio when I'm safe.
Let's go.
I was personally put in charge of Glen Damone's protection.

The mafia accountant.
Trial lasted five months, no less than 20 bounties on his head.
He never got one scratch under my watch.
Wait.

That was on Witness Protection, not me.
Watch your head.
When they clear the compound, take out the driver.
- If anyone kills Scorpion, they die next.

[♪♪♪]
SNIPER:

- You'd be wise to take cover.

Duck!
- Oh, shit.

- We gotta go.

- Where are you going?

- You're not field.

WOMAN:

We're under heavy attack and need immediate assistance.
Roger that, Seattle S. W.A. T.
Hang tight.
Backup's on its way.
[♪♪♪]
SCORPION:

MAN:

SNIPER:

[GUNSHOT]
Not on my shift, motherfucker.
[♪♪♪]
Fuck!
Do not let him get away.
Commander, nice of you to join us.
HALL:

Back to the compound.

[GUNFIRE]
Holy fuck.
MAN 1:

- Clear.

[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]
MAN 3:

- Everyone inside.

- I'm on the move.

Dwyer, shut us down.
- I'm on it.

What part of "we need him alive" do they not understand?
[KLAXON BLARING]
[♪♪♪]
Are those shields?
Well, you have to admire their resilience.
Nicholas can you open them?
It's one thing to hack their comms and cameras but shields are controlled by the mainframe.
It'd need to be taken out before I can do anything.
LARS:

Leave the rest to me.

Kill everything.
Ready the next wave, and let's see how resilient they truly are.
SIMONE:

HALL:

What the fuck happened?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

I assure you, inspector, what's out there is far more dangerous to you than me.
They're only dangerous to us because of you.
You brought this to our door, all of it, and I can end it right now.
And you think killing me will stop this war?
Ellen, this isn't who we are.
[♪♪♪]
- Now what?

ELSON:

- ...they're jamming the cell tower too.

Any satellite phones on-site?
ELSON:

Why are cameras working but not Internet or phones?
In cases like this, you wanna see.
So we put security on the internal mainframe.
And they would want to see as well.
They hacked the security cameras.
- They can do that?

For somebody who's good enough, it's not.
HALL:

- Don't let them see what we're doing.

SCORPION:

These are professional soldiers.

[PHONE RINGING]
- I thought you said the phones were out.

HALL:

LARS:

Yeah.
I'm the man in control of the small army sitting on your doorstep.
Do you have a moment to chat?
If you want to put me on speaker, go ahead.

Everyone should hear.
[OVER SPEAKERPHONE] I should've done this earlier.
It would've saved us all a lot of time, sweat and blood.
I have your compound surrounded.
Your power, your network all of your communications are down.
No one knows that you're in trouble, and no one's coming to help.
Your officer spoke to my associate, Simone not the dispatch operator.
Hello.
The man you pulled out of a box belongs to me.
Hand him over and I'll go away.
Just like that?
Just like that.
Can't do it.
Scorpion I know you're listening.
Tell these people who I am.
His name is Lars Cohagen.
He runs a private military corporation...
- ...that specializes in dark ops.

- Some not so small.

LARS:

Let them return home and enjoy what's left of the holiday.
They could still catch the fireworks.
How many times are we going to do this?
This is it.
This is our last dance.
I've heard this before.
Commander Hall, the man you're protecting is a consummate liar.
His skills of deception supersede even mine.
In fact, I will guarantee that he's lying to you right now.
Has he told you there's one in your organization that's against you?
Or that he has information that could set the world ablaze?
He's a liar and a killer and nothing more.
All your problems go away if you just turn him over.
And I already told you I'm not doing that.
SIMONE:

What about Daniel Chu?
David Jefferson?
Luis and Maria Gutierrez?
Carley and Rebecca?
Is Scorpion's life worth more to you than their lives?
Are all their lives worth Scorpion's to you?
[♪♪♪]
Enough.

But before I do I want your guarantee.
No harm comes to anyone here, nor their families.
You have my word.
I will be out in 10 minutes.
You'd better be.
ELSON:

HALL:

Shit.
HALL:

I only said I was coming out.
- You think you can take his army alone?

With the shields down, this place can withstand a riot.
You don't have to go.
WARD:

- You giving yourself up or not?

- We can't let him.

Did you not see that army out there?
We just lost Phil and Benson.
I don't plan to join them because of this son of a bitch.
You heard him, commander.
He's threatening our families, and there's no backup.
This guy's a fucking liar.

No.

Not after all that's happened.
It ain't his fault a lunatic's shooting the building.
Maybe it is.

Scorpion could've escaped or killed us several times.
He didn't.

That just might mean that he needed our help to survive.
That doesn't disprove what Lars said.
Believe Lars when he says he will stop at nothing to find a way inside to get me.
If I do not come out now, that army outside those phony agents they are just the tip of the iceberg.
You're right.
We'll put you by the back door.
Only it won't be you.
In theory, it should work.

You should be good to go.
I wanna thank you for your assistance today, Nicholas.
Oh, my pleasure, sir.
Did you know that Scorpion and I used to be partners?
Right.

It was great for a while and then five years ago in Berlin, he betrayed me.
After all we'd been through.
You know, and I knew it.
I knew something was wrong, but I didn't react in time.
Since then, I've taken greater precaution in my business dealings because no matter how much you think you know someone they could stab you in the back.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Um....
Yeah, I think so.
Good.
WARD:

You wanna raise the door shields and let the army in?
Not let them in.

Why won't that work?
Because it's batshit crazy.
HALL:

Once they're in the courtyard, they're trapped.
How do you figure that?
The back door is located in the deepest part of the courtyard.
Here.
Now, about three dozen office windows look down onto it.
That's where we'll be.
We'll make them think we're handing you over.
To sell it, Elson will find a way to open the rear entrance shield.
Once they get eyes on the bait they're gonna move in underneath our hidden positions and that's when we hit them.
They'll be sitting ducks.
It's the first time the shields have ever been activated.
I've never done nor am I sure isolated openings will work as you describe them.
Yeah.

They'll be expecting that.
HALL:

They got us boxed in.
We can't call out, and you said it yourself.
It's only a matter of time till he finds his way in.
At least this way, it's on our own terms.
Look, guys, this isn't an order.
I'm not forcing you into this.
But I, for one, don't wanna sit around and let someone else determine my fate.
If I'm going out it's gonna be on my terms, not theirs.
[♪♪♪]
If this is what you want, I will need firepower.
HALL:

What exactly are you looking for?
SCORPION:

In the meantime, spread out and load up.
Just because I'm browsing don't mean I'm giving up on you.
What the fuck do you do with that?
You don't want anything to do with that.
That's when you got nothing to live for.
Huh.
YORK:

Oh.

SCORPION:

- Excellent.

Regular radios still work.
He may have tapped into those frequencies.
He will not be able to do so with this model.
Okay.

You gotta change.
HALL:

I assume that's not on your birth certificate.
You are assuming I have a birth certificate.
All right, you're not gonna tell me your name.
At least you can tell me how you know Lars Cohagen.
We were once partners.
[♪♪♪]
I never said I was a good man, commander, just good at what I do.
You do not know me, commander.
You should not take this risk.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Even holiday double-time ain't enough to deal with this shit today.
You know, the job is risk.
It's not about or for you.
Not any longer.
Our guys' blood's been spilled today.
Someone's gonna pay for that.
[♪♪♪]
SCORPION:

The person on the inside who is working against us.
When they attacked the van, they were waiting for us.
Someone told Lars you were taking me from the compound.
GUTIERREZ [OVER RADIO]:

Copy that.

- We go on my call.

Good luck.
Never really believed in luck.
Well, good luck anyway.
[♪♪♪]
Everyone set?

ALL:

Yes, sir.
Sof, you remember Suffolk, a few years back?
Yeah.
That was another supposedly cakewalk mission that turned into a shitshow.
What was it, 40 gangbangers against eight S.W.A.T.?
I tell people I never know how we survived that night.
But I do know.
We're S.W.A.T.
We're the baddest motherfuckers on Earth.
Let's get in position.
Take care of each other.
The least he could do is give us the microchip to barter for our lives.
There's no microchip.

- Hey, make sure we're in position before...

It's not my first rodeo.
Don't fuck up.
How we looking?
When we get the go, I hit enter, and it'll raise the rear-entrance shield.
- But not the rest of the building?

In theory.
In theory?
In theory.
[♪♪♪]

MAN 1:

SIMONE:

Commander, is your team ready?
Let's go around the horn.
Hooks, set.
- Jefferson, set.

- Gutierrez, set.

Ward, are you in position?
Ward?
Sorry, I was using the wrong mic.
We're all set.
- Raise the shield.

[KLAXON BLARING]
It worked.
SIMONE:

They're opening the shields by the rear entrance.

HALL:

SIMONE:

What is that?
Morse code.
- Pull everyone back.

Everyone move back.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hey.
HALL:

Fall back to the command center.
GUTIERREZ:

Fuck.
- Elson, shut down the rear shields.

- Where's everybody?

Scorpion's M.I.A.
- Dwyer left a few minutes ago.

We saw a light at the third-floor window...
- ...and she bolted.

Right there.
Stay here.

- Where are you going?

Scorpion, come in.
Scorpion, do you copy?
[WHISTLING]
Get up.
I'm gonna let you out of here.
You're gonna tell Lars I'm gonna find another way to give him Scorpion.
No one else needs to die.
Shit, it was you.
Yeah, I'll tell him.

WARD:

Fifty million's a sweet fucking payday for a cop.
Those DEA assholes are always skimming off the top.
- About time I got some.

This mess is Hall's fault.

What the hell's the plan on getting me out of here?
We're gonna cut the power to the mainframe.
With shields up, Lars can take care of the rest.
- Where are the controls?

Thanks.
DWYER:

[NECK SNAPS]
[GROANING]
[♪♪♪]
Fuck.
HALL:

Oh....
- You all right?

It was Ward.
I saw him talking to Franklin before Franklin killed him.
- Where'd he go?

- Yeah.

What's that?
CHU:

- We're blind outside now too.

It is.
- I've lost control of our security system.

What I mean is the same crazy fuck that's been attacking us can open our shields and there is nothing that we can do about it.
[CLATTERING]
Closer.
Clear.
[KLAXON BLARING]
- What the fuck is happening?

YORK:

[♪♪♪]
FRANKLIN:

Oh, yeah.
DWYER:

[GUNSHOTS]
SIMONE:

Dead or alive no longer matters.
I will go in there and fucking kill him myself if I have to.
Go!
Everyone, move in.
Shoot to kill Scorpion on sight.
MAN:

[♪♪♪]
Oh, shit.
- Everyone fall back.

HALL:

Elson, come on.
MAN:

Let's go.
Clear.
Move, move, move.
Let's go.

Man down!
[♪♪♪]
HOOKS:

Jefferson.
Go.
[JEFFERSON GROANING]
Later, bitches.
[EXPLOSION]
[♪♪♪]
Get over yourself.
[♪♪♪]
Let's go.

Duck.
HALL:

You meant that kind of firepower.
SCORPION:

The way out.
I found a maintenance tunnel.
HALL:

SCORPION:

- Nope.

- All right, give me a boost.

Fuck.
CHU:

- Travis.

No way I'm leaving one of our own behind.
Get them to safety, okay?
You don't know how many of them are still up there.
- Or if she's even alive.

- Go on.

He won't be.
I'll call for backup as soon as I can.
- You don't have to do this.

You didn't have to come back just for us.
I didn't.
HALL:

[♪♪♪]
SCORPION:

Lars would never give up.
[GUNSHOTS]
[♪♪♪]
[GRUNTS]
[GUN CLICKS]
At least I got you.
Now let us see if you can finish the job.
[♪♪♪]
[SCORPION YELLING]
[BODY THUDS]
[♪♪♪]
[♪♪♪]
Hey.
Hey.
- What happened?

Good guys won.

HALL:

DWYER:

DWYER:

- Still no signal?

Gutierrez said she'd call it in when they got out.
Cell towers must still be jammed but it shouldn't be too long now which means you need to disappear.
I don't know if I have it in me to run anymore.
I am constantly running.
That and all the people trying to kill me it's exhausting.
You got all that money in your head.

That is blood money.
[♪♪♪]
As a matter of fact....
Dude, what the fuck?
SCORPION:

What the hell is it?
SCORPION:

A microchip.
What's in your head.

And now it's better in your hands.
DWYER:

Yeah, what'd he turn out to be?

The least he could do is give us the microchip to barter for our lives.
HALL:

[♪♪♪]
- Ellen, what are you doing?

You should have just handed Scorpion over, Travis.
No one was supposed to get hurt.

Don't.
Don't.
It's over.
[♪♪♪]
[INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]
MAN:

- Good?

GUTIERREZ:

And she knew.
I never liked her.
What is that?
A souvenir.
AGENT:

Can I ask you to come and identify the body?
Is this the man known as Scorpion?
[♪♪♪]
- That's...

AGENT:

GUTIERREZ:

HALL:

The less you know.... [♪♪♪]
HALL:

- How's the party going?

- I've been worried sick.

I'll tell you about it when I get up there, okay?

CARLEY:

- Three.

- Four.

[CARLEY LAUGHING]
HALL:

Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetheart.

Or 20.
- Hey.

Yeah.
This is enough.
For me.
Just you and her.
I don't need anything more.
But I'm pregnant.
[LAUGHS]
- Are you kidding me?

[BOTH LAUGHING]
- Is that what you were trying to tell me?

Did you know about this?
Yeah, I could tell.
The two of you....
[FIREWORKS POPPING]
[♪♪♪]
[PHONE RINGING]
HALL:

DISPATCHER:

We need you and your team on-scene ASAP.
[♪♪♪]
