There will be women... in time, if that's your desire.

"to sweep the streets clean of the parasites that befoul our society and create a civilization based on the principles of absolute order and uncompromising discipline."

And yet, only one of you will prove worthy enough to join our ranks.
But before we begin, are there any questions?
Do you validate parking?
No, we do not.
£12 an hour, and you don't validate?
It's standard policy.
Then it should have been clearly stated as such beforehand so that I may have found street parking, or... more likely, given the failure of this organization to in any way convenience me...

Validate his car.

Welcome to The Grail.
"The Grail"?
Please, Herr Starr, have a seat.
For over 2,000 years, this organization has been at the very heart of world affairs.
What do you think is the source of our enduring power?
I would imagine a combination of economic influence and sexual blackmail.
Some, of course.
But the true inspiration of our authority is...
Christ.
Hmm.
You seem disappointed.
I was hoping for something more in the vein of atomic warfare, not myths and legends.
This is no myth.
Christ lives on.
Yes, yes, he lives in our hearts.
No, Herr Starr.
Christ lives in a top-secret location guarded by machine guns.
♪♪
Does he?
Yes.
You see, before he sacrificed himself for our sins, our Lord gave a final gift to humanity...
He fathered a child.
For generations, The Grail has protected this holy lineage in preparation for one event...
The End Of The World.
Only God knows exactly when, but it will be soon.
We have been assured from sources at the highest levels.
And The Grail will be ready.
And at the exact moment that hope is abandoned, our Savior will reveal Himself to the frightened masses.
♪♪
Ingenious.
The world on its knees, begging for direction like the ugly girl at a gang bang.

May I ask, what would be my specific role in all this?

Our job is to rid the world of their competing narratives.
Charlemagne.

You name it.
You... will be my right-hand man.
The Grail killed Abraham Lincoln?
Mm.

And why did we do that?
He preserved the Union, won the war, sense of humor.
