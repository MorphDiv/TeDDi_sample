The thing I remember the most... was this little human girl.
My family told me never to make contact with the humans.
But I used to watch them whenever I got the chance.
She had long, curly hair.
She was wearing the most beautiful dress.
That dress was the whitest thing you've ever seen.
And it had a blue ribbon wrapped around her like a belt.
Well, you don't see much of those dresses anymore, Aunty.

UNCLE JIMMY'S VOICE: "Two hunters would travel far from the camp to collect food for their family."

"The older hunter would always bring more back.
This was because he had a special boomerang.
His was much faster and would never miss.
The younger hunter asked the old people where he could get a boomerang like this."
"The old people told him of a special tree, so the younger hunter headed out to cut himself a stronger and much larger boomerang.
But the younger hunter did not notice that the tree's blood ran hot and poured like lava.
It was the blood that made the older hunter's boomerang so powerful.
It would cut through his prey, killing them instantly."
