Welcome to Moscow.
Please enjoy your stay.
- The boss is expecting you.

Showtime.
'Kay, Gerry.

It'sonyounow .
Welcome.
Sala'amaleikum.
Take a seat.
You've traveled a long way.

You'll have to forgive the less-than-tasteful decor.
The fancy hotels are all booked for the anti-terrorism summit.
Is that it?
Allofit ?
Gentlemen, please.
Please.
We'reallfriendshere.
Hmm?
I understand you are anxious, here, in your enemy's territory.
But I assure you that is precisely why you are safe.
No one would dream of looking for you here, right under their noses.

Ofcoursemistrustishealthy whenconducting thesesortsof transactions, but rest assured, gentlemen, nobody wants to die today.
We are honest criminals.
Here it comes.
I'll show you mine, if you show me yours.
Um-hmm.
You're happy?
Yes.
I'll take your word for it.
- Don't forget this.
Without it, she's useless.
-What is this?

There is no need for this.
I insist.
Ah.
Ah.
-What's going on?

He should've confirmed by now.
We need to go in.
We're not supposed to be engaging at all.
Track and confirm only.
-Our business is concluded.

What is it?
What the hell just happened?
I'm not sure.
Sleep well, chaps.
What is that?
A homing beacon's been activated.
What?

From in there.
Now, I know this must look bad.
There's actually a very funny story.
You didn't let me get to the funny part.
That was definitely gunfire.
-Agent Cooper, stand down!

-Goodbye.

My finger's on the trigger button.
If you shoot me, this whole place becomes a memory.
Now, lower your weapon and walk away.
-No.

I mean, "no."
I will not lower weapon.
You do understand what will happen if I push this button?
Um-hmm.
Okay, so just to be clear, you're perfectly happy for me to kill us, your friends, your family, and millions of innocent people, have I got that right?
Da.
Because button does nothing without key.
That's a good point.
You hit good...
For a lady.
Enough!
Goodbye.
FBI!

Agent Cooper?
Agent Cooper, come in.
Nothing.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Simon templar.

Well, Simon, you're interfering with a government operation.
Special agent Cooper, FBI.
Since when does the FBI have jurisdiction in Russia.
It's a joint task force.
-Who's coming?

You set off a homing device on the nuke.
-Who are you trying to contact?

-Bullshit.

Wait, wait, wait!

Making the sensible choice.
-Cover me.

Son of a bitch!
--I need some backup in here.
Only ten in clip, rookie.
You want to reload?

-You're welcome.

-Are you serious?

-And what's the charge?

Agent Cooper?
Agent Cooper, we're in.
Better late than never.
But don't worry.

We just need to place him under arrest.
Who?
Son of a...
The Saint?
--Patricia, perfect timing.
Myspecialty.
How'syourRussianadventure?
Very Russian.

--And, uh...
Not quite over.
Escaperoute'son yourphone.
Right.
Where am I going?
Theairport.

I've got you a charter flight.

Ms. holm, you are as efficient as you are beautiful.
Ah,thankyou asalways,darling.
AndI mustsay,the beard doesgiveyouacertain...

Oh?

I should shave it off at the first opportunity.
Oh,I likeyouwith alittlescruff.
I'll take that into consideration.
- The united nations - relief agency has pledged aid to the region, but the money's been held up over fears that it simply won't reach those in need.
Meanwhile, presidentEzekielibaka is said to have secured nearly 2.5 billion dollars in aid from private entities.
Thenewlyelectedpresident, whopromisedto  stampoutcorruption, personallyreachedout togroupsaroundthe world inanefforttokeep  hiscountryfrom fallingapart.
My father was a hero.
A warrior.
As inspiring as he was fearsome.
One of the greatest generals Nigeria has ever known.
He loved his country...
At times, I felt, even more than he loved me.
It would pain him greatly to know what I have done.
He was a proud man.
He would never stoop to begging, as I have.
That's not true.

The lengths to which you have gone to help your people, Mr. president, will go down in history.
And remember, it takes courage to ask for help.
The generosity you have shown my country has been overwhelming, and it will certainly help the healing process, but sadly, it's still not enough.
Did you ever think that 2.5 billion dollars would not be enough?
Well, that's why I'm here.
I pledge to you, and your country, all of my talents.
We will make this work.

Yes, we will.
-I don't think I have ever seen a ring like this before.

Well... family heirloom.
It's very dear to me, actually.
It serves as a reminder, of a time long ago, when the world was very different.
Less complicated.
When good men banded together to fight for what was right.
It motivates me to this day.
It brought me here, to you.
And I'm incredibly grateful that it did.
All right.
You'll have access to the bank accounts at midnight.
By 12:01, I want them cleaned out.
Yes, sir.
Um...
-What is it?

Should we be doing this?
I mean the 2.5 billion isn't blood money.
It's going for aid to people in need.
Now don't start growing a conscience, Arnie.

He asked you about your ring, didn't he?
It practically sealed the deal.
How did you know he would?
It's a conversation starter.
-What did you tell him?

That it was a family heirloom.
I just didn't tell him it wasn't my family.
I almost gave it to him.
Why?
Because he's pathetic, just like the man I took it from.
You've kept it all these years, it must mean something to you.
Here.
It's yours.

All right.

Yes, sir.
Simon templar, you're the most peculiar thief I know.
Coming from you, I'll take that as a compliment.
You have the list?
Right here.
Eight hundred thousand to doctors without borders.
-Seven hundred fifty thousand to migrant assistance.

1.5 million to children's hunger fund...
Listen...
You want to give all this money to children?
Th-they are so little.

Your money.

Just make sure the money gets where it needs to go.
Minus my very little commission.
Minus your rather hefty commission which several of your competitors would gladly undercut.
Yes.
But they don't have my good looks.
Or your discretion...

Andininternationalnews, 2.5billiondollarsearmarked toaidthenationofNigeria hasapparentlygonemissing.

-Didyouwatchit?

Just another corrupt dictator stealing from his people.

No.

I think he's just been trusting the wrong people.
And you know this because...
A hunch.

How very entrepreneurial of you, darling.
Better watch my back or you'll have my job.
No, you can keep it, darling.
Ilikebeingthe brains oftheoperation.
Oh, is that what you are?
So what does that make me?
Themuscle,love.
You'reallmuscle.
Now, listen.
I've recently seen the Nigerian president in the company of this man.
Just sent to your phone.
Who's this?

ButI 'verunhispicture througheveryfacial recognitiondatabase Icouldtapinto andtheonlyothertime  heeverappears is in an NSA surveillance photo with sheik Muhammad al khabiri, a terrorist financier who's now enjoying a lifelong vacation
in a CIA black prison somewhere.
Something oddly familiar about him.
Lemmeguess.
You rowed together at Oxford.
Tell you what.

If you can find some leads on the missing money, it'sgonnabe rightup ourboulevard.
Yeah.

-But, Simon?

Imighthavebeenwrong aboutthebeard.
Itmakesyoualittle, dareI say...
Older.
Goodbye, darling.
You, gentlemen, were the only ones who got perfect scores on your exams.
I am most surprised at you, Mr. templar.
You had perfect grades.

I never looked at the answers, sir.
And yet you felt compelled to break into the master's office-- we didn't break in, sir.
- I made an impression of the key.
So you admit it?
There's nothing to admit, sir.

Which would have never happened if you'd stuck to the plan.
You were supposed to miss a few answers on purpose.
Why would you steal an exam paper?
You don't need to cheat.

You have a responsibility.
I expect you to conduct yourself in a certain manner in this world.
I didn't cheat.
I just stole.
I appreciate the distinction.
But why, Simon?
I wanted them to like me.
I wanted to be...

-You are a part of something.

A family of rich snobs no one likes?
Do you have any idea how this family acquired its fortune?
Do you even know what it is i do for a living?
Well, perhaps it's time you learned.
You've seen this before, haven't you?
That is the symbol of the knights templar.
Who are the knights templar?
That is a very interesting question.
See, a long time ago, in 1119, just after the end of the first crusade...
A small band of knights were traveling back to their kingdom...
You did good, Coop.
Why don't you take some time off?

I, uh...
I want to open a new investigation.
What?
Simon templar... who's that?
They call him "the Saint."
I talked to brodsky at interpol as well as inspector teal over at Scotland yard.
They've been after him for years.
He's an international thief.
He's wanted for money laundering, computer fraud, smuggling...
-This the guy from Russia?

Coop, look, uh...
You're the kid genius and all, but the director feels we went way out of our comfort zone for you last time.
There's nothing on this guy that involves the United States, for sure not domestically.
We're the FBI, not the CIA or interpol.
He compromised an active anti-terrorism operation, and we're what?

He's not our problem.
The bureau won't back you on this.
-No, but you-- -i...
Won't back you.
Speaking of interpol,
-that ever check out?

In your report, you said this "Saint"
set off a homing device alerting interpol to the nuke.
-Did that ever check out?

So maybe he wasn't really the bad guy in the situation.
What about the gold?

What, you think he gave it to charity?
Agent Cooper...
I don't wanna hear you talk about this "Saint" again.
And you know what, no more field trips for a while.
You're desk bound until further notice.
-It's absolute bullshit.

Yeah, who is it?
I'drathernotsay .
Okay.
I need protection.
For me and my family.

Ineedyourassurance thatwewillbeprotected.
How'd you get this number?
Comeon,agentCooper.
That is the least interesting detail that I have information about.
Okay, you have my attention.
Last night, 2.5 billion dollars intended for relief in Nigeria was diverted to several untraceable bank accounts.
H-hang on.

Because I diverted it.
--Yes.
It was valecross.

I didn't think he had the balls.

You know, the first call he'll make will be to the FBI, asking for protection.
And he'll offer them the money in exchange.
And we can't allow that to happen.
Good.
I'm not immature.

I'm eighteen years old, daddy.

Zooey, I didn't say you couldn't go.
I just said you couldn't drive my car.
I'm not talking to you, Katherine!
Why did you marry her anyway?
- She's not even mom's age.

God!

Okay.

I don't speak that language.
Are you here for my dad?
He deals with a lot of sketchy, foreign guys.
Because...
I could not stop for death, he kindly stopped for me.
Emily Dickinson.
I love her, Ms. valecross.
School's out for summer.
It's a mess.
Weknowthatthe fans arealreadyblaminghim  forthecharges of trying to leave out of town.
-Allright,that'sall  we'vegottimefor .
Now moving to headline news at the top of the hour with our very own Fiona krinchauf.
Hello, zooey?
It'sa helplessfeeling, isn'tit,Arnie?
You take from me, i take from you.
I'llgetyou yourmoneyback.

I know you will.
I just need a little bit of time.
While I've got all the time in the world, but, unfortunately, your daughter doesn't have that luxury.
Please...
Don'thurther.
We... her wellbeing is entirely in your hands.
I tell you what.
Because I like you, you've got 48 hours.
Patricia, I knew you missed me.
Desperately.
Really just thought you might be interested in something I picked up at brunch.
-One of the waiters.

Actually,no.

Hard to forget 2.5 billion dollars.
Exactly.
Well, I've found it.

Where?
In accounts managed by a private banker.
-Arnie valecross.

Like most thieves he tries to stay off the radar.
Sorry, old boy.
Lotta people are looking for that money, none of them with good intentions.
I tracked valecross to San Diego.

On my way.
Just need to Chuck a few things in a bag.
Morning, ladies.
- Hi.

Whatever makes you happy.

Hey.
Hey, dora, whatcha got for me?
Well, the call definitely originated from the grand del mar resort in San Diego.
-Uh-huh.

Oh, yeah?
So one of the guests is listed as "Ronald crossvale."
Which is a pretty obvious recombination of "Arnold valecross,"
a banker at bici who's been red-flagged in our system for the last couple of years.
Thank god for the stupid criminal mind.
Uh... what's bici?
Bank of international credit and investment.
IRS have been after them for years.
Major tax cheats, off shore accounts, suspected money laundering.
Just the sort of people who can not only steal but wipe clean 2.5 billion dollars.
Right.
What's wrong, sweetie?
I don't even know why I'm bothering.

There's no way that Simms is gonna let me fly out west and deal with all this.
- I've been thinking about that.

My girlfriend used to date a guy in the international ops division who'd probably love to help out.
Oh, yeah?

Special agent John fernack.
-Fernack?

-And you wanna know why?

She says he's been chasing your Saint for years.
Really?
Fernack.
Please tell me you're hear.
"Is valecross here?" Is the more important question.
Heis.
For how much longer, i have no idea.
Well, if he tries to leave, i expect you to use your many charms to keep him there.
You're such a boy, Simon templar.
- Zooey, sweetheart.

-Idon't...

Daddy,they'regonnakillme.
As you can hear, your daughter is getting rather agitated.

Yes, of course.

Wire the full amount to the account number you were sent and your daughter will be returned to you unharmed.
-HowcanItrustyou?
Frankly, I don't see you have much of a choice.
Welcome to the grand del mar.
-Thank you.

Nice ride.
Thank you.

Valecross knows we have his daughter.

We've got a problem.

-Simon templar?

Huh.
I have to hand it to valecross, bringing in outside help...
I may have underestimated him...
On the other hand, the universe has a funny was of circling back on itself, isn't it?
Weshouldkilltemplarnow.
Patience, marius.

Yes.

That I leave entirely to your discretion.
This will be fun.
-Pool side?

Lovely day.

-Oil -huh.
-Using any protection?

You know me.
Hmm.
Focus, darling.
Our mission is to get the bank info from the valecross safe.
It's in the Manchester suite.
-One guard at the door.

Keller 9000.
If he has the account data, it will be in there.
You are a very clever girl, Ms. holm.
I know.
FBI.
Mr. valecross, how do you do?
I'm special agent John Henry fernack.
I understand you have information from you regarding the assets of- no, I don't.

Well, then why did you call the FBI?

I no longer work for the bici.
Were you stealing from them?

Threaten you?
Look, I'm sorry, inspector.
-You made your trip for nothing.

It's never nothing, Mr. valecross.
Good day.
Oh, well.

-He followed you here from Russia.

But I know these FBI boys talk to each other.
Y'know,there'ssomething tooeasyaboutthis.
I felt the same thing when I traced the accounts.
It's like valecross wanted to be found.
Simon...
-Be careful.

-So,wheream Iheaded?

Theroomrightnext tovalecross'suite.
Now, be nice to the bodyguard.
Morning.
Housekeeping.
If you could do your thing, please, Ms. holm?
Hey, there's a guard right behind the adjoining door.
Sorry, my friend.

--Um, my favorite sound.
Well, hello, you promising little box.
Youareapartofsomething.
You've seen this before, haven't you?
That is the symbol of the knights templar.
- What is it, Simon?

-Simon?
This is a very thoughtful gift, Mr. valecross.
I've been looking for my father's ring for a long time.
May I show you something?
Now, would you mind telling me why you lured me here?
I figured you wouldn't wanna talk with a guy like me, but
-maybe for 2.5 billion dollars you would.

Unless you're gonna cut me a check, what can I do for you?
My daughter's been kidnapped.
Well, the FBI's in the building.

If I let the FBI handle this, I'll never see my daughter again.
My sympathies, Mr. valecross, but when you launder cash for the world's most corrupt dictators, that kind of thing tends to happen.
I hid the money.
I was going to give it to the FBI but my daughter was taken before I could turn it over.
Look... if they'll exchange her for the money, just do it.
They'll just kill me.

She doesn't deserve that.
That's why I need you.
To handle the exchange.
To help us get away safely.
- Please.
You're the Saint.
You Americans always take everything so literally.
Simon, Simon, get outta there, now!
Everybody, clear out, now!
Brace for hard landing!
It's okay.

The account numbers...

The key is a nomad.

Save my little girl.
Where did you get the ring?
Simon templar.

Put the bloody gun down, fernack, and call an ambulance.
Put the gun down, no.

Now!
After years of chasing you around the globe,
I finally got the Saint.
Simon!
-Good to see you.

-Valecross?

But we need to find his daughter.
This had better be good news.
Things got a little out of hand.
-Valecross is dead.

Templar got away.
Probably with my money.
You losing your touch, marius?
Icanfixthis.
Yes, well, I sincerely hope so.
Simon!
Simon?
Why didn't you answer when you heard me call?
I'm sorry, I was reading.
I have someone i want you to meet.
Someone very special.

How do you do, sir?
I do just fine, young man.
Well, I should leave you to it.
Leave us to what?
I think I'll let Xander explain that.
Good luck.
I've heard you've been having some troubles at school.
Don't be ashamed, Simon.
It happens to the best of us.
What are you?
-A head doctor?

You know, a psychiatrist.
No.

I'm not a doctor.
I'm a trainer.
After we get finished here, no bully in the entire United Kingdom will dare mess with you.
Good reflexes.
Now hit me.
-What?

Don't be scared.
Loosen up a little on the grip.

Lesson one:
Never take your eyes off your opponent.
-Can you teach me to do that?

And much more.
Now, hit me again.
That's crazy.
A helicopter attack in broad daylight.
You know what, I'm gonna sleep with my shoes on.
There's never a dull moment when Simon templar comes to la.
How's all that gear working out for you?
I can see why you're Simon's go-to for local transport and op-tech.
Doyle, any chance for some breakfast?
It's two boiled eggs, toast, marmalade, and a pint of coffee.
What, do you think I'd forget, boss?
Okay, so we got two and a half billion dollars floating in the wind.
I've always wanted to buy my own Hawaii.
What's ten percent of two and a half billion split three ways?
83.3 million.
The money is ransom for the banker's daughter, we're not keeping it.
Sorry if that puts a damper on your real estate ambitions.
How are we going to find all this money that, we're not, you know, keeping?
My long lost ring.
Valecross said that the account numbers are on it somewhere.
-The templar cross.

In theory anyway.
The inscription is Latin.
Nullum est periculum.

No risk.

That's recent work.
Oh, yes.
Ha.
I think that is what detectives would call a clue.
Looks like a diamond.
-It's synthetic.

With all due respect, you are as beautiful as you are tech friendly.
-Where did you find her?

It was hardly dire.

A beautiful woman in chains, three dead bodies, sixty miles south of Baghdad.
I can't wait to hear this one.
Ha!

You know, if you let me put my hands down
I might be able to find the key to those chains.
-You're British?

I even understand cricket.
-Special forces?

In Iraq?
Well, the gas is very cheap here at the moment.
Hm.
Do you have a name?
Patricia holm.
Simon templar.
Can I offer you a lift somewhere, Ms. holm?
That's enough of the flattery.
It's only flattery, Ms. holm, if it isn't true.
Now, what are we looking at here?
Scrambled bank account numbers, I assume.
I need the right frequency to decrypt the data and a password or a key.
Before he died, valecross said the key is in the nomad.
A nomad is a digital file, it doesn't live on a computer.
But in separate packets, on multiple servers.

I love it when you talk nerd.
So we need to find this nomad, get the key, read the crystal, swap it for the girl, and Bob's your uncle.
-So where the devil do we start?

Doyle, have you checked the garage?
I love a flash ride.
But we have the kids.
It's a family trip, love.
- Trust me, cap'n.

It's like zygotes, they could go either way.
You know, it's a pizza or donuts, donuts or pizza.
Hey, donut-pizza.
- There's another one.

FBI.

Special agent John Henry fernack.
You must be captain Miller.
And I'm, uh, I'm garces.

You know, the guys down at the precinct said you, uh, you might be here.
-Oh, yeah, this is our spot.

You could've let me finish my lunch.

About this.

International thief coming out of London and New York.
I've been chasing him for years.
-And?

I need the help of a native.
I'm one-eighth cherokee.
Take him.

-The cherokee?

It's gonna be fun.
Who are we today?

You keep her busy, I'll scan the electronics for signs of the nomad.
Mrs. valecross, so sorry for your loss.
We represent the holders of your husband's life insurance.
Are you Simon templar?
Yes.
-Yes, I am.

Iheardwhathappened toArnieon theradio...
When I was coming home from work.
When I walked into the house, the phone was ringing.
It was the kidnappers.
They said you'd be coming, and if I called the police, they'd kill zooey.
Until that moment, you had no idea she had been taken.
No.

Zooey and I never really got along.
She thought I was too young to be with her dad.
Mrs. valecross...
How much did you know about Arnie's banking activities?
I knew the men Arnie represented were evil.
I knew he helped them steal and hide billions from the countries they ruled.
But, you know, recently...
I don't know, maybe through my influence, he...
He had a change of heart.
He wanted that money to go back to those countries.
Back to those people just so they could have better lives.
But I feel so guilty, like
I'm responsible for what happened to my husband and zooey.
You shouldn't blame yourself.
I'm gonna find that money and use it to bring your stepdaughter home.
Okay?
Thank you.
I scanned the computers, but the drives have been wiped.
Arnie must have done it remotely before he was killed.
So where lies our nomad?
The data we need is off-site.

Time we don't have.
Kidnappers didn't happen to leave their phone numbers, did they?
Keep him talking as long as you can.
Templar.
Shame I missed you in San Diego.
Sorry about your helicopter, old boy.
It's okay.

I'm more upset about you destroying my arms deal.
Well, that container of assault rifles in Mali?
I thought that blew up rather nicely.
Shall we set the exchange?
Thegirlforthe money?
I need a bit more time.
So why don't you send the girl home to mum as a sign of goodwill, and Patricia and I will keep looking for the money.
YouknowIcan 'treleaseher withoutcashin hand.
Let's say 24 hours, and she dies.
Tell Patricia I say "hello."
Rayt marius says "hello."
Does he?
Didn't know you two were acquainted.
Before your time, darling.
I only got a partial trace.
Not enough to get his exact location.
The money?

Rayt's waiting for it, which means we have a bit of time, but we need to get moving.
If I don't see the money, you'll die just like your daddy.
No!
Please stop.
-Please.

I'm in a band with a bunch of cops.
- I've got that metronome going-- - that explains it.

Let me ask you a question.

Why don't we grab him?
No, that would be the worst move we can make.
- If we wanted to bust him.

He's a person of interest in the valecross homicide.
No, because he's our best chance of recovering that money.
The minute he gets it, i will be there.
All we need to worry about is not losing sight of him.
Doyle, corner of grandview and lake.
That's Arnie's data facility.
-Can you hack into it?

Hard to imagine you and rayt marius having much to talk about.
You're right.

So, what exactly did you and he do?
Simon...
What?

We have been on the road together for a year now.
And by design we've avoided any nights of wine addled over-sharing.
We all have our secrets.
Okay, back off, back off, back off.
I'm sorry, you gotta stop.

-What?

You told me to-to stay close to these guys.
Fine.

They're gonna know we're behind them!
-I never tailed anyone.

Guys, the firewall is too heavy.
We'll have to find an interesting way to liberate that file.
Gonna be really interesting.

Oh, bloody hell, it's fernack.
-Darling...

Can you run in those heels?
You see?
- Out of the way.

Garces, go after her!
She's faster than him!
Hey, out of the way.
Freeze!
Where are you gonna go now?

You're under arrest.
- Really, fernack?

Enjoy this moment.
'Cause I'll be coming after you again.
You know, it doesn't have to be like this, fernack.

I don't work with criminals.
I lock 'em up.
Not me, my friend.
Not ever.
-Sorry I'm late.

How'd you leave things with agent fernack?
Better than that car factory in Cologne, but, uh, slightly more humiliating than Mumbai.
Hm.
So the data storage facility's in there, is it?
-Yeah.

We'll use that trick from studio nippon.
-Following the power drain.

Gotcha.
The servers are in the sub-basement.
And the nomad packets?
-How do we hook those fish?

Splice into the hard line, send 'em out one by one.
That leads us to the money, which we then swap for the girl.
One problem.
The valecross accounts shut down and reboot at 6:00 A.M.
Then we'll never find the money.
Simon, rayt will kill zooey.
We need to gear up as soon as possible.
On that clock?

-Sonali alves.

There's no chance she's forgiven you for that, boss.
What happened in rio?
Um...

Ah.
Who's sonali alvez?
I'm not surprised Simon has not told you about her.
-Is she a butcher?

Is it too late to order?
I'm thinking some queijo minas with pinhao in a half-moon pastels.
And maybe some cuscuz branco.
So what happened in rio?
Before your time, darling.
Sonali, good to see you.
You used to be happy to see my face.
Remember breakfast in bed at the copa palace?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, tranquilo,huh?
You clip me, i take out your boss.
Sonali, I know I'm not your favorite person anymore, but we need your help.
You burned my super note deal, i lost everything.
The ink, that copier built to federal specs.
Look, we had a wonderful time together but I simply couldn't let you destabilize the global economy.
-An influx of counterfeit cash--

Listen to me, we need your help.
A girl's been kidnapped.

-We have cash.

-Hmm... you two are okay.

But him...
He's gotta pay for what he's done.
Obtero rinoceronte.
Rhinoceros?
Perhaps we could talk about this.
Let's pack another freon spinner, the acidic gel, and the fiber-optic splicer with petabyte piggy back.
-A bait box?

Do you need anything else?
Uh... nope.

Are you not at all concerned about Simon?
Oh.
You're a big boy.

Other side effects include acne, testicular atrophy and prostate swelling.

Thank you.

Thank you.

-Cheers.

Here's your 40.
Um...
-It was good doing business with you, girl.

-Sorry about your guy.

We're associates.
He has never made love to you?
Are you recommending it?
Much as I would love to hear the answer to that, aah, we have somewhere to be.
-Are we done here?

Very good.
-Sonali.

-Ciao.

I thought you said you weren't one to take a punch.
Oh, it's all pretend.
How are we for time?
The server resets in 40.
Your point of entry is the emergency exit.
Simon, are you sure you can muster the strength for a midnight heist?
Of course I can muster, Patricia.

We invented muster.
-Did you?

I found templar, with the girl.
Theyareon theirway  tothemoney.
Thismayworkout asplanned.
If I want your opinion, marius, I will ask for it.
Simon templar is not going to just hand over 2.5 billion.
He's going to try and be a hero.
Whatwouldyoulikemeto do ?
-Your job.

I am not going to let an innocent girl pay for the sins of her father.
- Saintly courage worthy of a templar.
The templars are nothing but a boy's own bedtime story, of medieval knights gone bad.
And yet you go, charging to the rescue, heart on your sleeve.
Here.
Can you keep this safe for me while I'm inside?
Giving me a ring without taking a knee?
Well, I'd hate to ruin this wonderful friendship that neither one of us deserve.
Will you agree, Ms. holm?
No risk.

That's it.
Hey!
What's wrong?
-That wasn't fair.

No battle in the history of mankind has ever been "fair," Simon.
This isn't a game, where rules exist to ensure integrity between participants in order to determine a winner and loser.
This is life.
Was it fair to the Japanese at Hiroshima?
Or what about the Jews in Poland?
"Fair" is something created by the weak, because they know they can't defeat the strong.
- But what about honor?
I know you love your templar knight stories, Simon, but at some point you'll have to realize that they're just...
Stories.
It is survival of the fittest out there.
Your enemies will seek out any and all advantages they can.
You must be prepared.
How do you prepare for the unexpected?
By expecting everything.
I'm at the outer access door.
You need to disable the alarm.
I'm on it.

If I have to, someone's getting tased.
Just get in there.
Excuse me.

Sorry to disturb you.

I was just wondering if you could show me where the restroom is.
No.
Okay... guess I'm just gonna have to hold it.
But you got a bad attitude, pal.
-What is this?

Honestly.

Give me a minute, darling.

Oof!
Okay, okay, okay, i can explain.

- You know what?

No, seriously.

You want me?
-You got this?

Go, you go!

Go!
Come here, buddy.

Back on task, Simon.
Huh?

Alarm is down.

That's weird.
That guy was unconscious two seconds ago.
Um...
Allright,thebestway intotheserverroom isthroughthevaultdoor .

I'm at the biometric scanner.
You, uh, give me a hand?
You are now Sidney felzberg...

Okay, I'm in.
Set the bait box.

All right, let's go fishing.
- Hello, Ms. holm.

Finally.
Looks like he's in the server room.
Watch her.

I'm garces.
Detective garces.
Charmed.
FBI.
-Where's your server room?

You, black jacket.

-Yes, sir.

Yeah, what about you?
Hello.
Hand me the bag.
Fernack, if I do that, an innocent girl is going to die.
Saving people's lives is my job, not yours.
Whatever you say.
Templar!
I could...

He took her.
I'm sorry.
I told you I was going to catch you, didn't I?
Your concern for your colleague is touching.
He's not dead.
- Let's go.
No...
It's Ms. holm.
Special agent John Henry fernack.
-Ihaveto talktoSimon.

Simon,I needthecrystal fromyourring.
It's the only way I can access the valecross accounts.
I have a yacht at the port of Los Angeles.

Be here by sun up.

Marius will kill them both if we don't stop them.
We?
-I'll call it in.

If you do that, they are already dead.

It's your call.
These are the account numbers you will use for the transfer.
One question.
When did you lose your mind?
Get it done.
You really think you're something, don't you?
British accent.
Designer clothes.
Hot little sidekick.
She's not my "side-kick," she's my associate.
A position I'd like her to retain.
You do know we're riding into a trap, don't you?
I think that's the one thing we can count on.
There are six guards on deck.
Once I've taken care of them, get in, take the girl, get out.
When all this is over...
I'm taking you in.
Move!

Taking a cruise without me, darling?
Ever the hero.

Where's the girl?
Bring her up.
Send her up.
Here.

That's not how you talk to a lady.
I talk to my wife any way I please.
Ex-wife!
Were you gonna mention this?
Hmm, you didn't ask.
I'm special agent John Henry fernack.
You're gonna be okay, but you cannot make a sound, okay?
- Okay?

Let's get this off you.
This side, clear.
Come here, you little bitch.
The famous templar family ring.
Poor little Simon...
His mommy and his daddy shot dead right before his eyes.
How do you know about that?
How do you think valecross got this in the first place?
From the same man who shot your mother and your father.
It's the only me you're after.
Leave my family out of this.
First time my dad brought you home, i knew it.
And you know something, it feels good to be right.
-Shut up.

Isn't this a morning full of surprises?
What's so surprising about a gold-digger killing her husband for his money?
Katherine, really?
That's why I have three guns.
Time to leave.
It's over, marius.

Saving the girl won't bring your parents back.
Who killed them?
Who killed my parents?
You, Simon templar, are just a pawn in a bigger game.
How you doing?
She just used him.

You should know, your father was a very brave man.
He risked his life trying to return money stolen from people who desperately need it.
If you like you can finish what he started.
Just press enter and the money will be returned to those who need it most.
You'll be okay.
Thank you.
Say goodbye to your boyfriend.
I still love him.

Actually, you won't.
Templar.
Templar?
Templar?
Ladiesandgentlemen, thisisallthe information wehaveat thistime.
- Um, Mr. president.

Do you know any detail surrounding the missing funds' sudden reappearance?
Idon'tknowwhere thismoneyvanishedto,  orwhereit camebackfrom .
Butrightnow, allI careabout isusingthesefunds tohelpmy fellowcountrymen devastatedbythis horriblecatastrophe.
Come on, come on.
I was expecting your call.
Too bad your thug marius failed in his endeavors.
He's not my thug.
Your man recommended him for the job.
Look, we can lay blame later on.
Right now, I need help disappearing for a while.
Youcantry, butyoubetterhurry.
You are not leaving me to take the fall for this.
I'msorrybut thebrotherhood hasdecided.
My compliments.
It's taken me an unusually long time to find you.
Hyah!

Looking for this.
I'm getting too old for this.
Hello, Simon.

- I have someone

Someone very special.

-Xander.

Take whatever you want.
Jewelry, silverware...

You, of all people, should know that money is the motivator of lesser minds.
And what motivates the brotherhood?

So smug.
So holier than thou.
But a templar is just a crusader by another name.
We too have a holy cause.
To wipe every last templar from the face of the earth.
It's only me you're after.
Leave my family, my wife, out of this.
My father asked you for mercy, not for himself, for his family.
And you gave him none.
I'm glad it's you, Simon.

But there's more than just me out there.
The brotherhood will be coming after you.
I'll worry about that when you're dead.
You can't do it.
You're still a little boy concerned with "honor."
I'm no assassin.
I'm a templar.
You're weak.

He wasn't weak.
He welcomed you into his home and you betrayed him.
But I'd rather be "weak,"
than whatever it is you are.
Good luck, Xander.

You do understand, don't you, that with one phone call, i won't spend a single day in jail.
We'll see.
Hands up.

Special agent Cooper.

Agent Cooper.

Wish I could say the same.
I see you've brought a friend with you.
Yes, this is my associate, agent dora Lee.
Based just on what I've tapped into during his file transfers in the last half an hour, he's got enough connections to terror groups and suspect funds to keep homeland security busy for a long time.
-What are the charges?

The us government just wants to talk to you.
Under national defense and authorization act sections 1021 to 1022.
Which authorizes the indefinite detention of terrorism suspects.
You see, we don't like to rush into anything without the facts.
- Facts that could take a long time to unearth.
Yeah.
And as for you, Mr. temp...
Son of a...
Take him away.
Come on.
One out of two criminal masterminds isn't bad.
I guess I should be glad that fernack did all the leg work and then let me get the collar.
Heh, yeah.
