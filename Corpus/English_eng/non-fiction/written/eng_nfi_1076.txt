Sometimes, I feel like Nan and I are almost like different species.
And in some ways, that's great.
If I was with someone just like me, it would be this constant, like, "Oh, who's handsomer?
Who's smarter?
Like, who tells the best jokes?"
Aah!
Whoo!
And with Nan, there's not any of that competition.
Hey, I almost died alone again.
You wouldn't eat me if I died in the house, would you?
Would you?
But part of being different means that there are aspects of each other that, like, we'll never understand.
Like, Nan exists in this very naive, idealistic kind of neverland.
She's so innocent.
"Can you tell me where to catch the 2 train to Brooklyn?"
That's not...
"Is this the 2 train to Brooklyn?"
That's...

But me, I'm just edgier and less ruled by societal norms.
For instance, part of me has always just really, really liked trash.
Just, like, getting into it.
And I actually like that about myself.
Unh-unh-unh-unh-unh!

But Nan is so uptight and pious that she feels the need to act like it's disgusting or something.
And that makes me worry about our base compatibility, you know?
Oh, buddy.
Oh, I know.

I wish you could, but you can't.

Come on out.

And, of course, when Nan starts packing up to leave,
I have to put on this whole show of being like,
"Oh, my God!

But in reality, I get kind of excited because I know I'll get to explore some things and, like, have a little fun for once.
Hello?
Hey.

Listen, Jason, how do I look?
Like, do I... do I look like New Yorky?

Uh, well, saying "New Yorky" isn't helping your cause.
Okay, Jason, um, I have, like, the biggest presentation of my life in six hours.
So maybe you could just like...
I just want, like, pure support.

You look... very New Yorky.
And they're gonna love you.
And then, you're gonna abandon all us lowly Pittsburghers.
- Okay.

All right, you're being, like, super-dramatic right now.
But also, super-sweet.
So thank you.
Okay.
Mommy's gotta go!

Ooh, I love you, and I miss you.
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah!
- Ooh, you're gonna like this.

I'm gonna be going on an adventure of my own while you're gone... in virtual reality!
Oh, gross.

They're not just for porn anymore.
It's called "Moons of Deimos."
It's sick, it's interactive, it's multiplayer.
- And I'm gonna play with all my buds...

You make it really easy to be just friends sometimes.
All right, I am gonna go.
Oh, listen, um, I forgot to take the trash out.
So can you take it out?

And, oh, the latch outside, remember, the latch is kinda...
It catches a little bit, so be careful with it.
Okay.

- I'm going!

Bye-bye!

Bye!

- Hey.

You're gonna do great.
Yeah.

Okay.
_
Uh-oh.

Wait.

No.

I mean...

Like, can you imagine Jason here?
He'd feel more comfortable in, like, a fictional moon.
Hey, guys.

Rigatoni Boy!
Here you go.
Oh.

Oh, nothing.

You wouldn't understand, Nan.
Kevin, that guy just assaulted you.
Okay, look.
I did a commercial when I was a kid where I got hit in the tats with a baseball and then I tried some of Mama Carnisi's delicious rigatoni, and it made it all better, okay?
That's it.

- Rigatoni Boy!

Ha!

- This guy.

- Hi.

Okay.

Oooooh!
Time to enter a whole different reality, dude.
I mean, I've had garbage binges that were honestly, like, personally transformative sensory journeys.
Like, they changed me.
There's just the combination of, like, the sweet and the salty and the rot and the umami and, like, the dirt from the hallway just, like, dusting the pad Thai.
I mean, one time, like, one time, there was a diaper in there.
The food just tastes so alive...

And Nan's always like, "Oh, my God.

You'll get sick and die.

And I'm like, I do it because it's dangerous.
The danger makes me feel alive.
Oh, crap!
I mean, it's not like I have to get in the trash.
It's just, like, no one likes it when you're looking forward to something and somebody just comes and rips it away.
It's just rude.
- You ready, bro?

- Call me Dorgon in here.

Especially when I already have the taste in my mouth.
Because once I get a taste, I can't stop until... until I've been satisfied.
The table is huge.
And you get to sit right up front.
Good to see you.
Um, I'm just...

I'm gonna use the restroom just for a minute.
I'll be right back.
Oh, my God.

Hey.

I don't think I can go back in there.
I mean, those... those people are all, like, they're so perfect and... and, like, clean, and I'm...

I don't even know what I was thinking.
Why did I think I could even...
Ow!
Dude, ow!
Look, you are brilliant.
And you're very smart, and you are extremely clean, okay?
And it's because of all the stuff that you went through that you have anything interesting to say.
So just... get it together, okay?
And let's get back out there.
- Yes?

- Are you good?

Okay.

Thank you for punching me in the boob.
Oh, my God.

I am very excited to be pitching you guys something that truly skates to where the puck is when it comes to minimal world-class product integration.
Not sure where my team is right now.
Whew!

I'm kinda hot.
Oh!

All right, I'm gonna give the floor over to... to Nan.
Hi, everyone.

I was actually in the bathroom feeling insecure and undeserving, which, as it turns out, is how most of America feels.
But I think we can help that...

Let's get started.
Uh, Jenn, Rigatoni Boy this is my dog, Martin.
And this is where our whole campaign started.
I'm sure when Jason the traitor stole the garbage from me, he thought he would get, like, bedroom-giggles time with Nan.
But in reality, like, he opened a whole new world of trash to me.
It's just at some point, enough is enough.
Like, I'm tired of hiding who I am.
By living in the shadows, like, I've actually been buying into her Puritanical narrative that trash is bad and unhealthy and shameful.
I'm not hiding anymore.
Like, there's a big, beautiful, trashy world out here, and I'm gonna taste every fetid, moldy scrap of it.
- To Nan.

Yeah!
Whoo!
I don't want to speak too soon, but I feel like this is the direction we'll be going this fall.
Oh!

But Tristen's never bought one of your ideas.
I hate you.
To Nan!

Every time I'm here, it blows my mind.
Just... all these lives just stacked on top of each other, you know?
Millions and millions of them.
I feel like your whole life has been building up to some kind of Woody Allen montage, that begins right now, on this rooftop.
I don't think we're allowed to reference Woody Allen anymore, actually.
Ohh, yeah.
I forgot that everyone was horrible for a moment.
Oh, no!

I have to have dinner with Dan's parents,
- who just came in from the Hamptons.

Are you gonna be okay if I just abandon you?
Um...
- You know what?

I'd hate to spend the night with these douchebags when I could be out enjoying a crisp, New York fall day.
The thing is, like, trash makes me happy.
If something makes me happy, like, how can it be wrong?
Excuse me.
Is this the 2 train to Brooklyn?
Oh, my God!
I have no idea, but I am so flattered that you asked me, so...
- Wow.

Hey, good luck.
Wow.
Sometimes, I get confused.
Sometimes, I overanalyze and I take simple, simple problems and I turn them into these mazes of insecurity.
But sometimes, my purpose is clear.
Like, it was all just teeth and hunger and the juice of old meat.
I was just fully me.
And the sad thing is, I'm sure if Nan saw me right now, she would start nagging about, like, how dirty and gross I am.
But, like, at this point,
I don't even care what she thinks of me anymore.
Nan will never understand the wonder of trash.
And maybe she'll never understand me, but that's her loss.
Like, I know who I am.
I'm an animal.
I'm a filthy trash animal.
Watch me roar.
Hold on.

- What were you saying, dude?

- No, it's just that, like...

I feel like we have this rare kind of connection, but at the same time, I just can't be something that I'm not.
And she doesn't want what I am.
I get it, dude, but you gotta be you.
I know.
But me is someone who wants her.
Look, I think you need to cut it off, even platonically.
Set yourself free.
Yeah, I think I need to stop devaluing myself.
Honestly, man, I feel like sometimes, she just doesn't respect me.
_
_
_
_
_
It was all kind of a blur.
But as I dug deeper and deeper into the garbage, it was, like, I just...

It's like I wasn't even enjoying it anymore, but it was like this compulsion.
Like, I kept eating until I physically couldn't fit any more trash down my throat.
And the craziest thing is that, like, some part of me still thought the trash held the answers... that maybe there was some different, like, more extreme form of trash that would make me feel okay about myself,
even just for a few minutes.
But then, I guess...
I guess I passed out.
Because all these memories came flooding back to me things I had forgotten or repressed.
Like, my mom was there and my brothers and sisters.
And I remembered, "Right,"
like, "This is why I like trash so much.
Because I'm a trash dog from a line of trash dogs."
And maybe all this time, Nan did know the real me.
Like, maybe that gate was left open for a reason.
Why would anyone want to be with a trash dog, like me?
Good girl!
Oh.
Hey.
Weren't you in the park?
Yeah, I was.
It's... bizarre.

- Hello.

Can we help you with something?
This is the girl I was telling you about.
The one who was taking pictures of us?
I'm not stalking you.
I-I saw you guys, and I followed you... to your house.
Which, saying out loud, I realize now that's definitely what stalking is, so I was stalking you.
I mean, you two remind me of me and my ex, and I just...

I wanted to see what kind of house you lived in.
I am so sorry.
I'm just gonna...

I'm sor...

Uh, what?
I know that's really weird, and I'm not trying to be creepy.
I just...
I just really want to know if this could work for us.
Me and this guy.
Not like us...

You seem very nice, and I hope everything works out for you, but we're gonna go inside right now.
That's absolutely understandable.

Sorry about that.
Did either one of you have to make any compromises, though, to make it... to make it work?
All right.
Pshew.
I know I say this all the time, but today was the worst day of my life.
But when I woke up, I just knew.
I knew I had to get back to Nan.
It's so real!
Oh, Martin.
You'd love it here.
There's so many birds!
I realize that some people might say, like,
Nan's this amazing, talented, beautiful, smart person whose hair smells like flowers all the time.
Like, why would she ever want to be with me?
And I don't know how to answer that question, but the beautiful thing is, as soon as I saw her,
I remembered, "Oh, yeah.

Nan is crazy about me."
Like, no matter what mistakes I make, it's almost like I can never do anything to lose her love.
Martin?
- Hey!

Martin was outside!
- What?

Oh, my God.

When I had the goggles on, I thought that he was on the sofa.
I'm...

I cannot believe I was about to walk in here and ask you to...
- Ask me what?

Look, hey, hey, I messed up.

Jason, Martin could've died!
You are such a child sometimes.

I-I said I'm sorry!

You know, people make mistakes.
When do you not make mistakes, Jason?
I asked you to be a grown-up for one day... one single day.
I feel like such an idiot for thinking you could pull that off.
Wow, that's...
You know what?
You shouldn't say things like that to me.
I'm gonna...

And, um...
I'm gonna go.
And, um...
I'm, um...
I'm not gonna come back.
You know what?

Sorry, man.
I think so often,
I forget the really, really obvious things in life.
Because I don't think it's all that hard to be happy.
I...
I think you just have to be grateful.
Like, you have to remember to be grateful for what's right in front of you.
Because me and Nan are really, really different.
Like...
Like, we're like 60% compatible at best.
And, like, we have these huge issues we have to work out.
But, like, when you're always running around looking for what's wrong with everything, you just... you just end up miserable.
Yeah, like, I'm a trash dog, and she's, like, a fancy lady, but we have each other, and that's what's important.
We're not alone.
And for that... for that, I'm honestly really, truly grateful.
Sometimes, I feel like maybe the reason we don't have the right answers is because we haven't really been asking the right questions.
One thing I've always wanted to ask is just, like,
"What if we never got out of bed?" Like, ever?
Why are we so convinced it would be bad?
Like, that might... that might solve everything.
Or we could not try my suggestion and we could just, like, keep getting out of bed every day expecting somehow to achieve a different result... even though that's the actual dictionary definition of "insanity."
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe it's worth a try.
