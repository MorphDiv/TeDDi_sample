[ROMAN] Hey, Jack, those racks don't go up there.
- [JACK] What do you mean?

- The ones with blue plastic go up there.

[JACK] Ah, okay, hey, sorry, I didn't realize.
Don't worry, you're fired. [LAUGHS]
[JACK] By the way, we're gonna miss you tonight.
Don't get sentimental on me now.
[JACK] But it won't be the same.
Shut up.
[JACK LAUGHS]
[ROMAN] We did it.
Roman, have they finished the frame on the sixth floor yet?
Yes.

The problem with the spokes in the basement?
Well, we solved that problem, too.
And if you start the enclosures tomorrow morning, we should be one day ahead of schedule.
So go home.
Why?
Well, your family's arriving today, right?
Yeah, but they're not flying in until later in the night.
[MATT] So go on, go home.
Get everything ready for them, it's a big day.
I have everything ready for them.
I mean, I have the whole house decked out.
Matt, you wouldn't believe it.

Well, you're better off leaving early in case there's traffic.
- Well, maybe you're right.

Now go on, get out of here and take tomorrow off.
Spend some time with your daughter.
Christ, you're gonna be a grandfather.
Go on.
Do not come tomorrow, I know you.

Passenger Jones, please see the ticketing agents at the gate.
[RECORDED VOICE] Please do not leave your luggage unattended, luggage left unattended may be removed...
[MAN] Thank you very much.
H... hey, man!

You're a good dancer.
- Hi.

Yeah, I'm waiting for a flight and it says it's delayed, but there's no ETA.
- It's AX 1-12.

Yeah taking off from Kiev, with a lay over in Frankfurt and New York.
- Okay?

That's right, yeah, I'm sure I didn't write it down wrong.
Please come with me.
- Thank you.

- Can you tell me your name?

- Can I see your ID, Mr. Melnyk?

My wife and daughter are arriving.
I know all their papers are in order.
We have a lawyer so, there shouldn't be any problems.
I'm sure there wasn't.
[WHISPERS]...around here.
Could you just have a seat in here, please?
[ROMAN] Okay, thanks.
Can I get you any water, anything to drink?
No, no, thank you.

I mean, are they here already?
I don't have all the information, so I...

Somebody will be right in to speak with you.
Okay.
[MUFFLED MALE VOICE] What do you mean?
What do you mean?

I need to see them!

Roman Melnyk.
Where's my family?
Um... my name is Eve Sanders and I'm one of the contact people assigned by the Airport Management Office.
I need you to listen very carefully to what I have to say.
The airplane that your wife and daughter were traveling in has had a very unfortunate accident.
There's still no official confirmation, but we need to keep in mind...

It is the worst news that anyone will ever receive.
She was pregnant.
Olena went to pick her up, to bring her back.
[MUFFLED SOBBING AND SCREAMS]
[POUNDING]
[EVE] Are this address and contact number correct?
And are there any other family members we should inform?
- [QUIETLY] No - [EVE] Nobody?
Not here or in your country of origin?
The Family Support Center has been set up at a hotel nearby.
You'll have access to medical and psychological treatments and social services.
That's also where you'll be updated on any news that comes in.
If you'd rather be alone, you can do that there, too.
[WHISPERING] No.
I would recommend that you go to the Family Support Center tomorrow,
[VOICE FADING] when you're feeling stronger.
You also have my email, cell phone and my department's phone number.
Please don't hesitate to call me.
- Yes.

[JACOB] Shh, we're gonna wake up Samuel.
- I love you.

- He's out.

I had this little stuffed bear, and his name was Ishmael.
- [SCOFFS] Ishmael?

That's a weird name for a bear.
And when we took trips I always had to take him with me
- or I wouldn't be able to sleep.

This went on 'til much, much later.
How much later?
'Til you were 24?

I don't know.
You always say you can't sleep without me.
Yeah, that's true.

- What?

Some lousy substitute for Ishmael?

Hey, being Ishmael's substitute is a big honor.
I'd do anything for Ishmael.
Did you have sex with Ishmael?
- I'm late for work.

[THOMAS] Two sips of that and you'll be running for the bathroom.
Yeah?

No.

No, just remember who warned you.

- You want anything?

I landed the last one and there's nothing on deck.
[PILOT 2] Canada 8-2-6.

Doing some maintenance on the telephone lines.
Gonna put it on security mode so it should work fine.
Sometimes the signal's a little weak.

[PILOT 4] Tower C, good evening.
This is AX 1-12 down for CMH, requesting permission to descend to 10,000 feet.
Roger AX 1-1-2, wait for confirmation on that descent.
[PILOT 4] Copy that.
[MAN] Hey, Jacob, Thomas stepped out?
What's up?
We got an unexpected flight, EF 1-3-5.
Had to change its route because of the bad weather.
- Headed for Pittsburgh.

[MAN] Go ahead and give that tower the heads up.
Connect me with Pittsburgh Airport, please.

[PILOT 6] EF 1-3-5, good evening.
I'm having a problem with the phone lines here and I can't get in touch with Pittsburgh.
[PILOT 5] CMH, this is DH 6-1-6.
We're getting a warning from our TCAS telling us to descend.
I repeat, the TCAS is telling us to descend, do you copy?
Tower, this is DH 6-1-6, do you copy?

Descend to 6,000 feet, do you copy?
[PILOT 4] AX 1-12, descending to 6,000 feet.
[PILOT 5] Tower, we've not heard confirmation from you, but we're gonna go ahead and descend to 6,000 feet.
- [MUTTERING] This goddamned phone!

[PILOT 6] EF 1-3-5, we talked to the airport.
Everything's in order.

[ECHOING FOOTSTEPS]
Hey, Jake, have a seat.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Two planes collided in the air at high altitude.
Apparently, there's wreckage from both planes in a valley several miles west of the 18.
It's unlikely anybody survived.
How many dead?
We don't know.
[STAMMERING] How many people were on those planes?
[ROBERT] We don't know, Jake.
[BREATHING SHAKILY]
[STAMMERING] Oh, my god, how many people are dead?
[ROBERT] Jake, listen to me.
Jake, Jake listen to me.

No one's accusing you of anything.
- I didn't do anything!

No one is saying you did anything.
We're trying to find out what happened.
We need you to keep it together because we gotta figure this out.
You hear me, Jake?
- No one's accusing you of anything.

We're just doing an investigation...
- [WHISPER] Listen to me, Jake.

It's very important.

[MUSIC]
Thank you.
[ROBERT] Let's go over it all again.

You arrived at the control room at 22:05.
You sat at your station.

You came back five minutes later.
At 22:25 Thomas told you he was gonna take a break and he left his station.
At 22:30 flight AX 1-1-2 requested permission to descend to 10,000 feet.
At 22:33, two technicians entered the control room to do some maintenance work on the phone lines.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
You went to Thomas' station to process the other planes.
[CHATTER ECHOING]
You called Pittsburgh, but the phone line wasn't working.
Meanwhile, flight AX 1-1-2 confirms its new altitude.
[CHRISTINA] Hey, I'm gonna be a little late picking up Samuel.

My sister just called and she heard something on the radio.
Honey, I just heard can you call me, please?

Jake, call me back, please!
[ROBERT] At 22:45 you contact the Airbus and tell it to communicate directly with the airport.
Without your headphones you never heard flight DH 6-1-6 alerting you it was about to descend.
Jake.

Don't speak to anyone, okay?
Don't answer your phone, don't leave the house, don't go anywhere.
We'll speak again tomorrow.

Jake.
Be strong, buddy.
[MUSIC]
[TV REPORTER] ...the two planes collided in the air at more than 8,000 feet for reasons that have not yet been determined.
Family members are coming to the scene, trying to get any information that they...
[DOOR OPENS]
[TV REPORTER]...passengers were on board, including the crew.
175 American citizens, 38 German, 37 Russian, 18 French, two Ukrainian and one Spanish.
The two airlines involved have released a joint statement regretting the accident and assuring that they are already fully cooperating with investigators in order to clarify what happened.

Yeah?
[EVE] Mr. Melnyk, it's Eve Sanders.
We spoke yesterday?
How are you feeling today?
Fine.
[EVE] Were you able to sleep?
- Have you rested at all?

Good.

[YOLANDA] ...trying to find any evidence...

[MAN] Hi, are you here to help with the search?
- Yes.

- of any of the victims?

- Alright, can I see some ID please?

Alright Mr. Fox, have you ever been in a similar situation?
Ever helped out with other accidents or worked with victims before?
- Yes.

Go wait by the truck, I'll be over in a minute.
Thank you.
Yeah, hi, are you with him?
- Yeah.

Okay, good, uh, do me a favor, join your buddy.
Read that and fill it out.

I'll bring over your equipment in a minute.

Olena...

Sweetie.
You know you're not allowed to be out here all alone.
- Where's your dad?

I haven't seen him since this morning.
Come on, is he inside?
[MUSIC]
[MAN] Hey, man, get up!
Come on, man, don't make me call the cops again, let's go.
I'm sorry, man, but every time you spend the night out here, I get in trouble.
So let's go, let's go.
[MAN ON TV] It will probably be frustrating to look for one person to blame, because what happened was much more complicated than that.
[SAMUEL] Daddy?
Samuel.
[SAMUEL] What are you doing there?
Just watching TV, I can't sleep.
Can you not sleep either?
I'm not sleepy.

Let's make breakfast.
You know...

Come on.
[MAN ON TV] Who were the people directly involved in the events we have just described?
Let's start with the control room.
Jake Bonanos and Thomas Fichman.
After analyzing all the information from the black boxes, testimonies from the people involved, evidence found on the site and all the other data made available to the press, we can arrive at some conclusions...
Smell.
[SNIFFS]
Mm... green chilies, vinegar, garlic, thyme.
I love thyme.
[MAN ON TV] First, there was only one air traffic controller in the control room managing the airspace.
Jake!
I thought we agreed, no news.
- Good morning, Mommy.

- [CHRISTINA] So early, huh?

Okay.
Alright, dig in.
- [CHRISTINA] It's raw.

- It's raw!

- Jake, let go.

- [CHRISTINA] Jake, let go.

- Let...

[DISHES CRASH]
[SAMUEL WHIMPERS]
It's okay we just spilled it, it's okay.
This stops now.
You can do this however you have to, but you don't get to do it to him, okay?
Do what?

Come on, back to bed.
- Come on.

You know what?

[MUSIC]
[NADIYA] Oh, I don't like you recording me!
What is this?
Mama!

Thank you, I love you.
[KNOCK AT DOOR]
[TESSA] Mr. Melnyk?
Mr. Melnyk?
My name is Tessa Corbett, I'm a journalist.
I know you're in there.
I don't want to bother you, I just came 'cause I wanted to share some of my articles with you.
I'm writing a book about the accident and I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You'll see from my articles that I'm trying to be faithful and respectful to the facts.
Take a look if you get a chance.
I'll come back and see what you think.
[KNOCK AT WINDOW]
Roman.

Oh, I'm sorry, but my house isn't presentable right now.
[MATT] You haven't seen mine. [CHUCKLES]
Hey, my wife made meatballs and she insisted that I bring you some.
She makes them with mushrooms, they're awesome.
- [SIGHS] So, how is work?

Everything goes a little more slowly without you there.
Uh, hey, I don't mean anything by that.
You come back... whenever you're ready.
So, how are you?
Are you feeling any better?
[SOFTLY] No.
Yes, better.
Better, it's just...
I need to get organized around here.
You know, I need to tie up loose ends.
Sure.
I need to get back to work.
I just need a little time to settle back in.
Well, there's no hurry, Roman.
Maybe I should spend less time at the cemetery.
The only thing is that Nadiya and Olena are there.
They can't leave.
So I go there and visit them, because... they can't go anywhere.
They can't.
[SIGHS]
I mean, on the other hand, I need to take care of things around here.
I need to clean up.
I mean, I should be doing things right now.
So, I...

Of course, I'll leave you to it.
You take care, Roman.
[CHRISTINA] Of course I love you, Jake.
I think this is best for Samuel and for us, and...

- Where is Samuel right now?

What, I can't even say goodbye to him?
Honey, you don't have to say goodbye.
You can see him whenever you want.

What did you say to him?

I just told him we were gonna spend
- a few nights at his aunt's house.

You know, he loves having the dog and the cats around.
He's not gonna understand that.
He will, not right now, but he will eventually.
We'll just make it normal for him.
Jake, I think you just need some time to focus on you.
Because if we keep living like this I think we'll just keep hurting each other and... you know, we'll get to a point where I don't know if we can fix it.
So we're gonna do this... for Samuel.
And for us.
Okay?
Yeah, for Samuel.
[MUSIC]
[MAN] That's the, uh, Springfield Armory.
Eleven plus one rounds, $674.
Three, two-inch Berettas, ten plus one rounds, will run you about $570.
Now, the two Smith Wesson models we have, the black MP, eight plus one rounds, will run you about $560, and the Airweight 38 special, it's got more of a classic air and a stainless steel finish, so that's gonna run you about $436.
Our cheapest model is the Hi Point nine millimeter, $199.
Comes with a free pocket knife.
[CARTOON MUSIC]
[AIRPLANE ENGINE]
[MAN] Mr. Bonanos, can we speak with you for a moment?

[REPORTERS TALKING OVER EACH OTHER]
[MAN] Jake.
How you doing, Jake?
[CLEARS THROAT] I'm fine, thanks.
If it's okay with you guys, I'd like to get straight to the point,
I don't wanna keep you waiting any longer.
Yeah, sure.
So we still don't have a trial date.
That will take a while but you know management will provide all the legal coverage you need, so.
We're thinking of you, Jake.
This is the second time I've offered, but we all agree you could use some psychological support.
I know Christina agrees with us on that one.
Yeah, right.
And as far as work goes, there are several options.
You could stay here doing administrative work.
Um, I don't know...
Or we could also offer you another possibility.
Only if you're interested, of course, but the severance package that we could offer you could be very advantageous.
[MAN] Management, they always recommend what's best for the worker.
But in your particular case, in order to guarantee your safety, it may be in your best interest if you were to consider making a change.
A radical change, Jake.
The safest isn't just another job, it's another city.
Another home.
Another name.
Another life.
[MAN] That's okay, that's okay.
But my... my wife's here.
My... my family.
I can't just...
We can't just up and move, you know?
[MAN] This may potentially be the safest thing to do for you and your family.
You really have to consider what we're presenting to you right now.
Think about their best interest and their well-being.
[DOOR OPENS, SHUTS]
[JOHN] Let me know when he gets back to you, alright.
[JAMES] Well, he was supposed to get back to me already.
- James.

I don't think you know the lawyers representing the airlines,
John and James Gullick.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
The meetings with the victims' families have been carrying over these days.
That's okay.
Allow me to say that most have been very fruitful.
Agreements are being reached.

To reach an agreement.
Mr. Melnyk, you are the only family member who has chosen to sue the company by himself, without a lawyer and without signing up with any of the victims' associations.
I'd like you to know that you have our complete respect, and that to us, it makes no difference.
Our proposal will be exactly the same.
James.
Mr. Melnyk, this is the framework agreement we're proposing to the families.
- I would like to just...

Now, in exchange, the company will take care of your family's funeral expenses and any medical or psychological treatment that may have been deemed necessary to date.
The company also agrees to pay you damages in the amount of
$75,000 for your daughter's death and $85,000 for your wife's.
- $160,000 in total.

There are also some minor clauses in the contract.
For example, you will automatically receive premium client status from the airline within our group.
You'll be able to benefit from those and other advantages.
These are details that you should read carefully because they are clearly explained in the contract.
I would like for someone to say that they're sorry for killing my family.
I want the company to apologize.
Mr. Melnyk, let me explain this to you a little more... simply.
If you don't sign this contract, you're probably not gonna get a penny for all of this.
Now $160,000 is a lot of money.
Someone in your... position shouldn't turn down such an offer.
Look at this photo.
Because you didn't before.
Look at it.
Look at it!
[PSYCHIATRIST] Where's your mind right now?
Still feel like you're unable to engage with your family?
Still feeling pensive?
Well, today let's try to focus on the positive feelings you've had this week.
Come...

On those moments when you feel at ease...
Maybe doing something you find satisfying.
It may seem silly, but makes you feel good.
Think about your daily routine.
At home, places you go, people you see on a weekly basis.
[JACOB] I really just want the prescription.
A stroll, a TV program, talking to a friend.
Look, I don't feel good strolling or eating, or seeing anyone, or talking to anyone.
So just give me the fucking pills, please.
Or I'll go down the street and rob the goddamned pharmacy.

[MAN] "And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."
That eternal life which Matthew spoke of, that feeling that tells us our loved ones are somewhere else, somewhere better, is the feeling that must prevail on a day like today.
One year ago we were struck by a tragic event.
Many lives were lost unjustly, incomprehensibly and unexpectedly.
But today the spirits of the people we lost are somewhere else, watching us.
And they can see that on a day like today we remember them and pay tribute to them.
And to keep this memory alive, to keep it ingrained inside of us, and in this place, today we inaugurate this monument, this Memorial to the Victims.
[CROWD APPLAUDS]
Roman Melnyk?
I'm Andrew Berg.
I lost my wife and my in-laws in the accident.
I'm very sorry.
I read the story in the papers about your daughter's necklace.
I thought it was nice that they used it as inspiration for the monument.
Do you like it?
Yes.
W... what do you... [SIGHS]
I...

I get up in the morning and I don't know what to do.
Maybe it's not that I don't know what to do the whole day, it's that I don't know what to do in the next hour or the next minute.
- I'm sorry, I'm being so honest.

Go ahead.
Sometimes I try to think of things to distract me, you know, just try and think about something else, then I immediately forget and I don't do them.
I just... sit at home, not knowing what to do.
It won't be easy, but sooner or later,
you will find something that'll help you get out of bed.
- You think so?

Be patient.
That's what I need, dammit.
Have you gotten through it?
- [JACOB] Ever been to Cancun?

It's a wonderful place in the northern tip of the Yucatan Peninsula.
Um, is that something you guys seem like you're interested in?
- [MAN] Yeah.

Okay, there's a cruise ship leaving out of Florida and it heads just straight down there.
Let me get some of your information, I'll get you guys started.
How's it going?
[ROMAN] Great.
Well, come on, time for a break.
No, I'd like to finish this side today.
I already opened them, so.
[CHUCKLES]
Thanks.
Oh... this week's pay.
Not until I'm finished.

I want you to help me find him.
[ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS]
[TESSA] Pat, it's Tessa.

I'm coming to town, is there somewhere we could meet?
The book is finished.

That's why I don't wanna ask you anything specific.
I'm not talking about an interview or photographs.
I just wanna give you a chance to say something.
Add a comment, a thought?
Or to not say anything at all, if that's what you want.
You know, sometimes I...
Sometimes I put myself in their shoes.
You know, the families'.
And then I think about my son and my wife, and it scares me to death, it's terrifying.
I mean, what can I say?
You know, I...
I just want this pain inside of me to go away.
So, tell 'em...
Look, I'm not a bad person.
Right?

- Yes?

Hi.
He put his house up for sale and moved to another state.
He works at a travel agency four blocks away from his new apartment.
And what's his address?
I don't know if I should give you that.
What's wrong?
I'd like you to use this information in the correct way.
There is no correct way or incorrect way.
It's not that simple.
I told you, I just want to look him in the eye.
Show him a photograph of my family.
I want him to apologize.
No one has said they're sorry.

Pat Dealbert.
[ROMAN] Pat Dealbert?
His name is Pat Dealbert now.
Where are you going?
Goodbye.
[DOORBELL RINGING]
Is Pat Dealbert home?
He sure is, that's me.
- We're here to stay the weekend.

- [JACOB] Hi.

I'm glad you're here.
Okay, let me get your stuff.
We were rehearsing his lines the whole way here.
Yeah, well, he did a good job.
Hey, you guys are a lot earlier than I thought.
Yeah, we made great time.
We had a speed demon in the passenger seat.
I'm just finishing up dinner, you guys make yourselves at home.
Yeah... your coat?
[JACOB] So who did you tell him Pat Dealbert was?
[CHRISTINA] I told him it was like Clark Kent or Bruce Wayne.
A name you told people so they wouldn't know the truth that you're a superhero.
- So I'm...

Yeah, at first, he said it was stupid, but, then he thought it was kind of funny.
[SOFTLY] Yeah.
And, um, how have you been feeling?
Um, honestly?
Alone.
Um...
This whole kind of place feels unnatural.
You know, I have days that I wake up and I feel like things are getting better and then... the next day I wake up it just kind of feels like things are getting worse.
Well, I'm...

Move here.
Quit your job... and move here, you and Samuel.
Yeah, this'd be a great place for all of us to get a fresh start.
And we could all be super heroes.
[LAUGHS]
I think we just need to...

You know, I think it's better.
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Um...

What?
I just thought that was the plan.
I guess, um... my plan was we could all fit in one bed, the three of us.
Okay, well, then my plan is no longer my plan.
Good.

[WHISPERS] Jake.
Hello?
[NADIYA] I love it.
Mama.

I love it.
[GASPS]

[BREATHING HEAVILY]
[ROMAN GRUNTING]
[NADIYA] I love it.
[CHRISTINA CHUCKLES] I think it all depends on this card.

[SAMUEL] I win.
- He got us.

- [CHRISTINA] Alright.

- Again?

Please?
Alright, it'll be a really quick game, okay?
- [SAMUEL] Yes.

You know what?

- Okay.

[DOORBELL RINGS]
[JACOB] Yes?
Can I help you?
Look at this photo.
This is my family!
Listen to me.

- Look at it!

You killed them!
I'm gonna call the police if you don't leave.

No one had apologized!
- You killed them!

You hear me?

You can't be showing up like this.

I'm gonna call the police right now, you need to leave!
You understand me?

It was an accident.

What's gotten into you?

- [VOICE ECHOING] Have you lost your mind?

You need to leave now or I'm gonna call the police.
You hear me?

[SOUNDS OF PLANE CRASHING]
[CHOKING]
[CHRISTINA] Stay here.
Olena, stay back.
Stay back.
[WHIMPERING]
Mommy?
Nadiya.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid, Nadiya.
No.

[MAN] "He did not know that the new life would not be given to him for nothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great strife and great suffering.
But that, that is the beginning of a new story.
The story of the renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into another."
[GUARD] Roman, let's go.
[MUSIC]
[LAWYER] So they agreed to review the sentence and apply the extenuating circumstances we presented.
And to be honest, Roman, ah,
I didn't expect them to reduce the sentence so drastically.
It's been ten years and you could get parole in four months.
You'll have to visit a psychiatrist three times a week, who will write up monthly reports on your progress.
If you go to every session and those reports are positive, you might not have to go back to prison, Roman.
[MUSIC]
[ALARM SOUNDS]
Hi.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Oh, sorry.

It's right over there.
You need to make a couple of turns.
- Come, I'll take you.

Yeah, I'm heading that way anyway, come.
Thank you.
Yeah, I've never been here before.
Oh, last time I was here was 11 years ago.
- Long time.

Everything is exactly the same.
Nothing has changed since the first time I came.
The same trees, the same smell of thyme.
- Same everything.

- It's savory.

Smells like thyme to me.
But it isn't.
You have family members here?
No.
My father isn't buried here.
You know, when I was following you,
I didn't know exactly when to approach you, where'd be the best place.
But when I saw you get on that bus this morning and I realized you were coming here I thought, the perfect place for this to end.
Wait.
[SAMUEL] Turn around.
Turn around!
Go ahead.
Do what you have to do.
I understand.
But I want you to know that, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for what I did.
I could do it.
But I'm not going to.
It's not what I was taught.
[BREATHING HEAVILY]
Will you just go, please?
[QUIETLY] Okay.
