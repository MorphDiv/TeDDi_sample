What you up to, Jeff?
I'm using this incredible new app to help me find love.
Are you rejecting these women based solely on their looks?
It's much deeper than that.
It also shows me what kind of music and TV shows they're into, all right?
I could be closing the door on a beautiful relationship here.
I'm gonna send her a heart.

Wait, what?
Man, I don't get it!
Why aren't any of these ladies biting?
I can't just sit back and watch this anymore.
This man clearly needs help.
Maybe we should let him use our dating app.
Sorry, guys, I don't think I have it in me to fill out any more dating profiles.
If I have to write that I'm a 420-friendly breast man one more time, I'm gonna scream.
Wait, wait, what's happ...
Okay.
Now let's go find you some soul mates.
I'm telling you, we live in a surveillance state.
They're watching our every move.
Denise, I'm sorry, I can't have another one of these lunches with you.
They're exhausting.
Whoa!
I'm compatible with all these babes?
Now we just got to weed out the ones you don't connect with emotionally...
Here they are, your lucky love matches.
As soon as I press this button, you'll be able to experience true love with Jessica.
I like the sound of that!
I haven't the foggiest where I put them...
Jeez, it was just a simulation!
How'd it go in there?
How'd it go?
She was 80 years old, you idiots.
She smelled like vinegar.
We spent half of our time in doctor's offices.
It was absolute bollocks!
Oh, dear, looks like you didn't open your heart to her at all!
This machine is programmed to find true love, Jeff.
It doesn't let superficial details like age get in the way.
There's no way I'm getting back in that hellbox without a little vetting first, okay?
Oh, I think you'll like this next one, Jeff.
27 years old, Columbian, and extremely fit.
Oh, okay, a little caliente Latin flavor, huh?
Let's do this!
Hola, mi amor.
Hello, sir.
Was he as hot in real life as he looked in the pictures?
We're, uh, obviously not communicating clearly here.
Yes, as far as men go,
I don't need 10 years with everybody to see if we match, okay?
Half hour, that's it.
And what does she look like?
I mean, this next one's a superstar actress.
Is that a dealbreaker for you too?
Scarlett Johansson.
Scarlett Johansson and I are a match?
Oh, God, why are we wasting time?
Get me in there!
Look at me, I'm the wizard of bubble land!
Oh, baby.
Don't you need to start getting ready for the Oscars?
Now, close your eyes, baby.
Oh, Scarlett.
Oh, Scar...
How could you just pull me out like that?
You gave me 10 years with Federico!
First you want it shorter, then you want it longer.
I mean, make up your mind!
Scarlett, we're meant to be together!
We're perfect matches!
We perfectly complement each others' hearts and souls!
Um...
She got a restraining order against me!
I thought the machine said we were perfect matches, and I definitely opened my heart, okay?
So that's not the problem.
Yeah, but come on, Jeff, if you blow it that hard, you can destroy any kind of love.
You've only got one match left in the entire world.
You better not goof it up, buddy.
Jesus.
Why is it always so, like, last chance-y around here?
Oh, holy [bleep].
Oh, yeah.
Here, hit this.
I [bleep] love you!
I [bleep] love you!
Oh, my God.
That was amazing!
She's perfect.
Hey, honey.
I just stopped by to tell you you're the most wonderful thing in my life.
Mwah.
She has a [bleep] boyfriend!
I don't understand.
You get hung up on the weirdest details.
No wonder you can't find love.
I hate this stupid machine.
No, Jeff, don't touch the machine!
Do not touch the machine!
It's thing but trouble and heartache.
Who... who are you guys?
What the [bleep] is happening?
Thanks, Jeff.
These pearl onions are really good.
Oh, I'm so glad you like them.
You know they keep mini vampires away?
That's garlic, not onions, you ding-dong.
There you go.
There's that little smile.
Oh, I like it.
I'm sorry, Jeff, it's just hard for me to wrap my head around all this.
You created me to find love?
I'm gonna take real good care of you.
Ooh, your hot tub's ready.
I'll be right back.
So when you gonna kill her, Jeff?
We didn't kill little Scarlett Johansson or Federico or Jessica.
Sure we did.
Why would you do that?
I mean, once the simulation's over, they... they have no use anymore.
Yeah, we're not hoarders.
Well, we're not touching little Kiki, okay?
She's a sweet little version of the love of my life, and she deserves respect.
She's not built for this world, Jeff.
And there's no telling what she'll do when that reality sinks in.
Ooh, scary.
Maybe she'll eat all my chocolate chips or something, huh?
You morons.
Um, sure.
That's nice.
You know, I've been thinking.
Even if it was just a simulation, the time we spent together was so amazing.
I want to do whatever I can to get you and the big me together, for real.
That's really sweet, little Kiki, but the big version of you is dating some dreamboat stud named Stu.
He was so clingy and needy.
I kept trying to break up with him, but I just couldn't shake him.
The big me is suffocating in that relationship, Jeff.
And the little me is gonna helpou get her out.
And on that fateful day in Berlin in 1971, a synthesizer repairman named Klaus Schmidt created a sound that would forever be known as kraut rock.
Oh, thank you, Germany!
Oh, so awesome.
Ahh!
Nice.
And we're sure we feel morally okay with this?
Jeff, trust me, this is in everyone's best interest.
Hey, babe.
I was just about to call you.
They got that almond ccolate you like at Freshy's and...
Stu, what I'm about to say might hurt.
What?
You know we haven't been connecting for a long time.
You're not breaking up with me, are you?
You didn't want to have this talk when we were in New Mexico, Stu, so we're having it now!
It's over.
Oh, God, this is the worst day of my life!
This is the worst day...
No, we did it, Jeff.
We make a great team.
Say hello to the world's greatest wingman.
What's up!
Hey, Jeff, we're having a cornhole tournament.
You're on Jimmy's team.
Sorry, I'm not good at athletics.
Oh, my God, little Kiki, are you okay?
It's just a little nick.
Are you guys insane?
Throwing those sandbags around when we got a three-inch person living in this house?
What's wrong with you?
Yes.
Yeah, guys, can I talk to you in the kitchen for a second?
You want us to move to the basement?
Little Kiki says that if I'm gonna have a real shot at this relationship,
I need to be a strong, independent man, and that means no more roommates.
And quite frankly, she's just been getting kind of a bad vibe from you guys.
You have to kill her right now, okay?
But we're your bros.
And you're putting her before us.
It just doesn't seem right.
Seems like there should be a saying for that.
Elephant Flute Lords?
Oh, you've, uh, heard of them?
Oh, my God.
These are, like, all my all-time favorite records.
Is that so?
I like your shirt.
Tell you got it at a...
Thanks, I got it at a Pussy Riot benefit.
I'm Kiki.
Uh, this is a real stab in the dark, but you don't by any chance like kraut rock, do you?
Oh, the syncopation is so sick!
What about the synths?
Oh, this is awesome.
The last girl I dated was into John Mayer.
I wanted to kill her.
The last guy I dated just... disappeared one day.
It was really weird.
But I got to say, I'm really glad he did.
Oh, [bleep].
That's your cue!
I never take my glasses off unless I want it.
No, no, it's too soon.
It sure is a nice night with all the stars in the sky and stuff...
Are you hearing this [bleep], Jeff?
I'm clearly just babbling nonsense waiting for you to make a move.
Hey, I was just, uh...
Hey, uh...
Mmm.
Mmm, mmm.
Mmm, mmm.
Okay, now slip your pinky in my butt.
Everything okay?
Jeff!
Are you ticklish?
Are you ticklish?
Here?
Jeff, I'm ticklish in my elbows and my forearms.
What are you doing?
That's the whole point of the game.
I don't want to know.
Are you ticklish all here?
♪ Oh, love is in my life ♪
♪ And I'm as happy as I can be ♪
You forgot to turn on the heat down here.
Oh... well, uh,
I'm just coming down to do a load of whites, so will you do me a favor and pop these in the dryer...
Why you hiding us away like a bunch of lepers?
If this Kiki girl is as cool as you say she is, well, then, why don't you just introduce us?
Yeah, we could study her, too.
We could all be friends.
And we could have sleepovers...
Guys, there is no way
I am subjecting anyone else to the nightmare of being studied by you three, okay?
Oh, and this goes without saying, but the lint tray needs to be cleared before you run the dryer.
Thanks.
Do you guys remember if he said he wanted a delicate cycle, or...
We're not doing his laundry, okay?
Um, Jeff, is this supposed to be my dinner?
Um, I couldn't make it to the specialty store.
But speaking of dinner,
I'm not gonna be here tomorrow night.
The big you is gonna cook me her famous secret casserole.
Oh, my God.
That's great.
What are you texting now?
It's too hard to explain.
It's an inside joke that me and Kiki...
Oh, my God!
She is so good at sending gifs!
Hey, I just had a crazy thought.
Oh, yeah?
What if we were the ones dating?
Uh... okay.
Uh, that is crazy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, excuse me.
Hey, what do you think you're doing, young lady?
Come on, Jeff, open your mind.
A really, really good friend who's the size of a piece of baby corn.
Okay, come on.
I mean, that is the perfect gif for... ♪ We're gonna eat so much ♪
♪ We'll get so full ♪
♪ With my casserole ♪
♪ My famous casserole ♪
♪ He's gonna be impressed, then I'll ride that pole ♪
♪ After the casserole, my famous casserole ♪
♪ Hey, good-lookin' ♪
It's just so petty of me to be jealous when I should just be happy for you guys.
I mean, you found love!
That's a big deal!
So how about a toast to your happiness?
Aw, thank you.
That means so much to me.
To me and you.
Well, not you, but, you know, the other you.
You know what I'm saying.
Ugh, this wine sucks!
It tastes like chemicals...
Ugh.
I waited for you for hours.
I kept calling you.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I think I got roofied.
Are you serious?
What kind of a maniac would do that?
Well, oh, my God, I'm just glad you're okay.
Mmm.
Okay, but, um, just for future reference,
I'm not a huge fan of being shushed and...
I can't believe this is how it's gonna end.
Guy gets his first whiff of [bleep], and nothing else matters to him.
There's more to life, Jeff!
Come on, guys.
Bye, Jeff?
I'm getting a little worn out here, okay?
I...
The only thing standing between us was our size, so I fixed that.
I'm good with machines.
This one time, I refurbished a '50s Fender tube amp.
It sounded so sick.
So I'm tiny right now?
Now we can be inside here forever.
You wanna jam?
I want to go back to reality!
Oh!
You're just a dating app!
Ow!
Argh!
Oh...
Little Kiki.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
Guys!
Leave the roller blades, Jimmy.
Damn it!
Oh...
The cockroaches!
Ride like the wind!
Whoo!
Whoa, whoa, oh no!
No, no, no, no, no, no, you idiot!
To the right, to the right, to the right, to the right, to the left, to the left, to the left...
Argh!
No!
Guuuuyyys!
Please, don't go!
Jeff?
I'm so sorry I ever let anything get in the way of our friendship.
My life is so much better with you in it, and I swear
I'll never put anything in front of my bros ever again.
Jeff, I'm sorry.
I couldn't make out anything you just said.
You got a real teeny, weeny little voice.
Yeah, can you say that all again?
If it isn't Jeff the player.
Wow, nobody's ever called me that before.
I'm so sorry I flaked last night.
I was so excited about your famous casserole, and I am super excited about you.
Well, the old me would make up some bullshit excuse right now.
But the truth is, Kiki, I'm...
I'm a very complicated guy with a very complicated life, and secrets that I haven't had the courage to share with...
No, you idiots, I said wait until she said okay!
What are those?
Jesus hell!
You [bleep] idiots!
Jeez, Jeff, I thought you said she was cool.
She is cool!
Let's get an ice pack.
We'll figure out a way to make this work.
Yay!
Cut.
