Welcome back to SPEN Sports for another episode of
Are They Still Cool?

Cody Maverick was set to become the biggest surfer to come out of Pen Gu since Big Z Topanga.
He shocked and awed fans and critics alike with his fresh, new-school moves.
He scorched nine-time champion and local bully
Tank "The Shredder" Evans and was perfectly positioned to win the tenth annual
Big Z Memorial Surf-Off.
Oh, I'm doing great, man.
I think I earned a lot of respect out there.
After I win today,
You're gonna see a lot more from me.
I promise.

It's been my dream since I was a little kid and...
Heh, heh!

Victory, fame and fortune were all but guaranteed for young Cody Maverick.
Until at the last minute, he chose to protect his friend Chicken Joe from sore loser Tank Evans, and gave up any chance of the trophy.
Chicken Joe took home first place that day and has since gained great fame in the world of professional surfing.
Maverick, however, has been all but forgotten.
Let's see what he's been up to in this episode of
Are They Still Cool?

So, Cody, why don't you fill us in on what you've done the last few years.
First, I have a question for you.
I, uh...

Have you or someone you care about expressed the urge to ride waves like a pro?
- To be the master of the ocean?

Well, I can show you how it's done at the Pen Gu Surf Academy.
At PSA, we got all the newest, sickest moves at the lowest prices.

You got it.
Tail rides?

Tube slides?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, man.

You can't just plug your surf school in our interview.
Hi, I'm Lani, lifeguard and co-founder of PSA, where we're all about having fun and being safe.
And for a limited time, mention this commercial and get 30 percent off your first lesson free!
Free, free, free, free.
Don't waste your money on those losers.
Oh, what now?
You should learn to surf from a real master.
Right, gang?
Yes, sensei.
Hi.

Just send me your parents' credit card information.
Cut it out, Tank!

No, we're not.
How can you promise these squirts you'll turn them into winners when you've never won anything in your life?
Look at all my trophies.
Each more spectacular than the last.
Tank, my arms are getting tired.
Fight through the pain.

Wanna learn how to shred for real?
Sign up now at TOSI and receive a free participation trophy with purchase.
Absolutely free, with purchase.
Tank, get out of here.
I'll also teach you about teamwork and proper surf etiquette!
Okay, cut.
Wait, stop.

I am so getting fired for this.
Come on.
Whoa, hey, wait.

I wanna tell you about my franchising opportunities.
With purchase!
Ugh!
Cody?
Cody?
Wake up, bro.
It's me.
Cock-a-doodle-dude!
Chicken Joe.
Or as my Spanish friends call me,
El Pollo Loco.
So what made you come back to Pen Gu Island?
Oh, you know, I haven't seen my buddies
Cody and Lani in, like, two years.
And I finally got some time off from my world tour, so I thought I'd stop by and hang out.
Time off from your tour?
Aren't you supposed to be in Madagascar right now?
Oh, man.

Oh, wait.
This is just a regular clam.
Oh, I missed you, bro.
Look at you, man.

I dig that wetsuit.
Yeah?

It's a little tight around my nuggets and tenders.
But my sponsors like me to wear it, so...
Dude, you have sponsors?
Totally.

It's kind of a sweet deal.
Heh!

Oh, it is, bro.

If you hadn't saved my life and let me win the Big Z Memorial, I'd never be where I am today.
Heck, you'd probably be the one with all the sponsors and endorsements.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'm happy for you, Joe.

Uh, hey, Cody, I picked this up for you while I was on tour.
Oh, thanks, Joe.
I know how much you like these super buff penguins.
Wow, the Hang 5.
Those guys rule.

Nah.

You know those guys.

Too crazy for me.
- Chicken Joe?

Penguin Lani!
It's so good to see you.
Chicken Joe, can you teach us your moves?
You're the awesome-est!
Yeah, we wanna learn from you.
Can you give us a celebrity guest surf lesson?
Yeah, I'd be happy to.

Find me some tacos.
The Hang 5.
Excuse me.

Come on, buddy.
Cody Maverick,
I am not spending my whole entire vacation chasing after you.
Mom, it's the Hang 5.
I've gotta be in the front.

Ladies and gentle penguins, it's the moment you've all been waiting for.
Behold the most extreme team, surfing the earth and living the dream.
Coming to you live in overdrive.
Put them together for the Hang 5.
Yeah!

He's the big kahuna, the leader of the crew-a.
The mammal with a plan...
Mr. McMahon.
Yeah!
The king of the big-wave riders, only 50 footers or higher.
To him they're just ripples, because the H is tripled.
Introducing...
Hunter.
Look, it's Paige!
She's the best trick surfer on the world stage.
Her skill and audacity cannot be gauged.
She's beautiful, fearless and full of rage.
Let's give it up for the one and only...
- Paige.

He's the Hang 5's enforcer.
Even sharks and orcas meet their maker when they go up against... the Undertaker.
I'm Undertaker!
He's hardcore times four.
He lives fast, surfs hard.
No regrets.

If you want some, come get some.
Wow!
Why the long face?
Huh?
No, I was just remembering the time I met the Hang 5.
I worshiped those guys.
Seeing them surf made me who I am today.
I worked hard my whole life so I could be just like them one day.
And somehow it just...

I mean, I love teaching the kids, but I didn't think that's all I'd be doing now.
I always thought I was meant to be somebody.
Doing big things, inspiring people.
I guess I was wrong.
Does this have something to do with all that stuff Tank said on the beach?
Cody, you can't let that guy mess with your head.
He might have all those trophies, but... he's still a loser.
Yeah, Tank is pretty annoying.
But... it's not just that.
It's not that hard.

Oof!
Chicken Joe?
Oh, I get it.
Well, don't get me wrong.
Don't get me wrong.

He deserves everything he's got, but I can't help but think, man, that could have been me, you know?
Famous, successful, a winner that everyone respects.
I mean, look at him.
He's even a better teacher than me.
Mm, guys, I have officially lost control of the situation.
Cody?

Okay, maybe not a better teacher.

What can I say?

I love my life here.
Sure, I'd like to travel and see the world someday, but right now, I got the surf school, my lifeguard job and big waves all year round to keep me busy.
It doesn't get any better than that.
Man, this teaching thing is harder than I thought.
You know what I dig most about Pen Gu?
What?
Nothing ever happens here.
Chicken and penguin!
Heh!

Something is happening.
Wait.
I've seen that seagull somewhere before.
Prepare yourselves.
It's the moment you've all been waiting for.
The Hang 5!

The Hang 5?

- Yes!

Oh, yeah.
Oh, great.

That was supposed to be my line.
You can still say it.
You know what?

There used to be respect for showmanship in this business.
Wait a minute.

If they were coming, trust me, I'd know about it.
Hey, Hang 5!
What's up, little dudes?
Uh...
Oh, my gosh.

We get crazed fans all the time.
But it's like I always say:
A brave man builds his house on an ocean of milk.
That doesn't make a lick of sense.
It doesn't have to.

'Cause I'm an otter, and otters like fish.
I just wish you could milk a fish.
I don't really know what to say about that.
Hey, bro.

Uh, yeah, yeah.

Uh, you guys eat food 'cause you're the Hang 5.
What about squid on a stick?
Squids?

I love impaled food.
Ooh, yeah, I'll try anything.
Oh, yeah?

Whatever gnarly stuff you can eat,
I can eat twice as much, twice as fast.
Jeez, Hunter, why do you always have to be so competitive?
You know what?

Come on.

Yeah, man.

Tell me more about these squid sticks.
Hey, look at me, Hang 5.
Whoa!

I know all your moves.

Ugh!
Help!

Oh, no.

Kid!
Hang on, Arnold.

Hold on.
Whoa!

Oh, that's just Arnold.

Lani's on it.
Arnold,
You know what I said about going into the ocean
- by yourself.

Thanks for having my back out there.
Aw!
Whoa!

Yeah.

You shouldn't try to imitate us.
We're trained professionals.
Some of us with huge muscles.
I'm not gonna say who.

Nice moves.
Oh, thanks.

Guess that explains the whale.
Oops!

Hey, Lani.

I'm throwing a luau for the Hang 5 at my place.
Oh, yes.

All right!
Yeah!
Yes.

Whoo!
Hang 5 is the real deal.
They've done everything.
Snowboard during an avalanche:

Check.
Check.
Whatever it is they're about to do, I wanna be a part of it.
Tell us a story, J.C.
Tell us a scary one.
- Yeah!

All right.

We were surfing the infamous ghost beach of Levesque where they say even the waves are haunted.
But were you scared?
Not at first.
But it was quiet.

Then this ghost wave grabs my board!
Whoa!

And then what happened?
So there I am underwater...
He was held down by almost 5000 psi of pressure.
Read about it in your interview with Rolling Waves Magazine.
Escargot-go?
Uh, no, thanks.
I woke up on the ocean floor...
I've practiced your breathing technique for years.
I can hold my breath for almost five minutes.
I'm trying to tell my story, bro.
Can I show you my variation on your five flipper shuffle?
Go check on the Undertaker.

Yes, sir.
All right.

Did you do a controlled emergency ascent to protect your lungs?
Uh, yeah.
How'd you know about that?
Cody taught us that at our surf school.
That guy?
Um...

If you kids think J.C.'s dumb old stories are cool, watch me uproot this tree.
Ugh!
Anyways, wanna hear about the time I fought off a shark with nothing but my camo shorts?
Yeah!
Mr. Undertaker, do you wanna try some of the...?
More.
Coming right up.
Hey, have you seen my friend, Cod...
Whoa, man, don't eat me.

Can you at least lay an egg or something?
Scary?

They say it's because I don't smile or talk a lot.
But I'm just shy.

Oh...
Little of this, little of that...
All right, add some spice...
Oh, yeah.

Would you like some coconut water?
That depends.
I prefer fish milk.
Uh...
All right, then I'll drink your coconut water.
But you better believe I'm gonna pretend
I'm sucking it from a fish's udder.
Heh, heh!

I do a little surfing myself.
Ah!

Mm-hm.

And you know what?

I'm talking next-level stuff, man.
Oh, yeah?

Really?

Excuse me a second.
Can I have everyone's attention, please?
What I hold here is the key that will unlock one of the greatest mysteries of our time.
Why everything seems to taste like me?
No.

The Trenches!
I thought that the Trenches were just, like, made up... to scare little kids.
Oh, it's real, all right.
And everything you hear about it is true.
It's hidden somewhere on Slaughter Island, the most dangerous and mysterious place on the planet.
Jagged rocks, huge cliffs.
It's a surfer's graveyard.
And we're going to ride it!
RTL!

Heck, yeah!

RTL!
Hey, Joe, what does RTL mean?
I don't know, man.

Ugh...
Oh, I shouldn't have eaten all those escargot-gos.
Surfing the Trenches will be the greatest ride of my life.
And my last.
Because you're gonna die?
No!
Because I'm retiring.
What?
Boss, you can't be serious.
Hey, I'm not getting any younger.
It's time for me to settle down.
What does that mean?

Maybe not.
Big Z always said Pen Gu breeds great surfers.
I think it's time we add a new member.
Have somebody in mind, boss?
I'm not gonna give away the surprise just yet.
But I think I might have found someone very special.
Yes!
How totally awesome is this, bro?
I'm gonna join the Hang 5.
Can you even imagine what that would be like?
Yeah, that sounds pretty rad, but, um, are you sure Mr. McMahon was talking about you, bro?
What?

He looked right at me.
Hey, Cody.

Yeah.

Hey.

I need to tell you something.
Sure.

Oh, um, okay.
You think they might ask you?
Well, yeah.

I've been following them my whole life.
And I'm the best surfer on Pen Gu.
Who else are they gonna ask?
Hey, Lani, I told my mom that you told me that you were going to join the Hang 5.
And then she said that I should get your autograph because she wants to sell it online.
What?
Whoa!

Cody, your imaginary friends are gonna be so disappointed.
So...

Yeah.

They said I showed moxie saving Arnold and they could use somebody with my lifeguard skills.
They're waiting for me on the South Shore.
But I don't know, Cody.

No.

It's the Hang 5, all right?

I'll figure something out.

Wait, really?

- I don't want to...

Go tell them you're coming before they change their minds.
I'll see you there.
Okay, okay.

Does that mean you're not leaving Pen Gu and joining the Hang 5 and fulfilling your ultimate destiny of becoming a legendary surfer?
No, I got an idea.
Come on, you guys.

Hang 5!
Prepare for boarding.
Don't be nervous.

I have a good feeling about you.
Ha, ha.

Is that them?
Yeah, yeah, come on.
Get over there.
Do what Cody taught us.
Um...

Look.

It must be Cody Maverick,
Pen Gu's favorite surfer.
Did you say Cody Maverick?
Let's go watch him.
Yay!
Yeah!

So have you done a lot of acting before?
Um... yes.

And I think Arnold comes from a Broadway background.
♪ I am the very model Of a modern major general ♪
♪ I've information... ♪
Here we go.
Showtime.
Whoa!

Sick.
Whoo!
Kid's got style.
Nice moves, kid.
Yo, Mr. McMahon, what about we bring Cody too?
Let's see what else he's got.
What?

I wanna bring the chicken.
In case I get hungry.
That's cool.

I'm not a great cook.
All right, all right.
Not so fast.
Tank is the one you want.
I heard you're looking for a champion to join your team.
So I brought my résumé.
Hm...

Reminds me of myself at a younger age.
Well, thanks.

I'm not as handsome as you are, sir.
Of course not.
Oops!
Oh, Briana!
Sorry about that.
Oh, that's... good.
- What?

You better take that.
Who made this thing?

Oh, again.
Ridiculous.

- Funny.

Well, now I have more of her.
So... thanks.
This is my guy.
Everybody else has a guy.

Oh, for crying out loud!
Fine.

Yes!
Yes!

- Ooh!

Yeah, I love those.
But they're your responsibility.
You've gotta show them how we do things.
We're gonna challenge you on all aspects of what we do.
Power, speed, endurance and teamwork.
May the best mentor-rookie team win.
Hah!

Well, obviously Lani and I will win.
Let's do this.
Do you know how to surf?
Dude, I'm a star.
Okay, we're in.
All right.

But if your guy or girl dies or gets hurt and I have to carry them all the way back here...
I'm gonna make you scrub the whale for a year!
All aboard!

So how much did you pay to bribe those kids?
Three shells apiece.
You're such a dork.
Not to mention a failure.
When I become one of the Hang 5,
I'm gonna come back here and crush your surf school.
All your students will be mine.
And they'll be happy.
Like me.
We can't let him win, Cody.
Don't worry.
I got this.
Can't this thing go a little slower?
Ha!

We're passing through some rough waters.
It's safer to go fast.
Aah, aah, aah...
Joe!
Thanks, man.
Almost lost my lunch.
Say no more, Under-bro.
I can hold your hair if you need to yak.
Ooh!
This is just amazing.

I'm traveling to the Trenches with the Hang 5.

Oh, man.

- Ow!

♪ Back-back-back On top of the world ♪
Look, I'm a diva, I'll admit it.
But I'm a power diva.
And I was thinking you fellas might wanna focus on me more.
We could do a spinoff, Power Diva.
A crime-fighting superhero surfing puffin with a bad attitude and a thirst for action.
Oh, it's got blockbuster written all over it.
♪ Is gonna stop me now ♪
We're almost there.
How can you tell?

I can barely see anything.
My shell told me.
It's a map that talks.
What's wrong, bro?
Don't you believe in magic?
We'll be there in four, three, two, one.
Look.
Gnarly.
It's so beautiful.
Are we here?

No, we're at the edge of Slaughter Island.
The Trenches is hidden here somewhere.
We're going to find it.
Forward, ever forward, our intrepid team presses on, woefully unaware that no penguin has ever ventured into the Trenches and lived to tell the story.
Looks like this is as far as the whale goes.
I got your board for you, Mr. Hunter, right here.
Thanks, Hank.
It's Tank.

You know what?

- Next stop, RTL!

RTL!
Did they tell you what RTL means?
It means "race the losers."
Let's get that guy.
Hey, excuse me.
Can you take me back to Pen Gu?
I think I left my sunblock.
- Come on.

- Oof!

Whoa!

Killer view, bro.
Hey, rookies!

Ooh, yeah!

Wow!

Dude, what is this?
The taste of death.
This is crushed whale bones.
I should move here.
All right, the conch is telling me we have to keep moving.
This place is dangerous, so let's head out.
What's so dangerous about it?
Hold on.

Okay, I'll tell him.
Conch says, shut up!
- Heh, heh.

From up here, it looks like the sand pit will take us straight into the island.
That'll save us a ton of time.
How about a race?
Last team to the bottom waxes all our boards tonight.
You're on, fool.

Yeah, Tank.

Ooh, I'm so scared.

Ha!

And as always, it'll be ladies first!
Me and the chicken are in too.

Hey, don't take this the wrong way, but didn't you used to be taller?
- Aah!

- You're standing in quicksand!

Cody, Lani, J.C., help!
Lani, pull!
I'm trying.

I got this.
Come on, big guy.

How much do you weigh?
Hunter, help me look for the chicken.
Already on it.
I found him.
There, by that rock.

Hunh!

Am I dead?

Come on!
Come on!

Aah!
Yeah!

Ha, ha!

Wow, J.C. Perfect form.
Thanks, kid.
Very impressive.
You gonna put me down now?
You're lucky it's leg day.
I'm just gonna sneak in a quick set.
Thanks, show-off.
Any time.
Leg-pressing a large, heavy boulder.
Then onto a one-handed handstand, all while still leg-pressing the boulder.
The secret to my amazing physique?
Eat right, exercise and never give up on being awesome.
Hang 5, let's do this!
All right!
Yeah!

Let's see how these wave jockeys perform on the dunes.
They have not put in the hours shredding the sand, but, wow, folks, they're putting on quite a show.
I make this look good.
Yeah!
Bring it!
Check this out.
Nice moves, Paige.
All right.
We do it old-school.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Lani, I see a shortcut.
Right behind you.
Ho, ho!

Whee!
Whoa.
Rest in peace.
Yeah.

Whoa!

Ho, ho!
Yeah!
Bye, J.C.
Ha-ha-ha.

This is it.
Eat my dust, Tank.
Oh, that's what you think.
Whoa!
Ha-ha-ha!
Sand's the best!
Cody!
You still with me, bro?
Ugh.

- Ha-ha-ha, awesome.

Paige, we finished first.
- I can't believe it.

That was incredible.
Ho, ho, ho, unh!
Mmm...
That tickled.
Great job out there, Lani.
Ha-ha-ha!
Thanks.

Gotta hand it to you, Paige.
You got me good when you banked off that rib cage and landed in front of me.
I've got a few tricks you haven't seen.
Hey.

Hey, flattop.

Heh, heh.

I like to take in the sights.
Remember, I like a nice high gloss on my board.
Don't get too comfortable.

That was quite a spill you took out there.
How does my dust taste?
You cut me off, you cheater.
Oh?

I'd never do anything
- to hurt you.

You should learn to stay out of my way.
I'm gonna join the Hang 5, no matter what.
How badly you want to lose is entirely up to you.
Grrr...
That Tank guy is ridiculous.

Why did you let Hunter bring him?
Everyone is here for a reason.
I want to see how the rest of the newbies deal with him.
You still think Cody has what it takes?
Look, Mr. McMahon, I know he wiped out out there, but he's a good surfer.

I'm not talking about surfing.

I think he's a bit of a hothead.

Don't worry about it.

He'll be cool.
All right, we'll see.
Okay, okay.

What did the wave say to the surfer?
Oh, what?
Have a swell time!
Get it, huh?
Have a swell time.
Oh, ha, ha, swell.

Oh, that was good.

Oh, Mr. McMahon, that's, like, the greatest surfing joke maybe ever.
So good.

Thank you.
What do you call a surfer that just broke up with his girlfriend?
Homeless!
Dude, Cody.

You're gonna burn a hole in that thing.
Ugh.
Tank cheated.
He knocked me off my board.
That's why we lost.
Yeah?

You sure?
He totally rubbed it in my face.
He practically admitted to it.
That's messed up.

Maybe let it go.
It's not worth getting all bent out of shape about.
We had an awesome day, right?

Yeah.

And I got to ride with you guys.

I mean, like, I can't believe this is actually my life right now.
I just...

Let me down?

Look, man.

If it's not Tank, it'll be somebody else.
Just take the high road.
You'll be a lot happier, I promise.
All right, man.

- Ha, ha!

- Pull.

Pull.

Whoa.

Why are they sleeping up there?
Mmm...
Maybe they don't like us.
I bet it's a tribal thing, you know?
Paying homage to the surfing gods.
Wrong.

It's actually for protection.
Protection?

This is Slaughter Island.
Who knows what's creeping around at night?
And you're gonna want to plant that board a bit deeper, bro.
Oh!
Ha-ha-ha.
You guys sleep up in the nosebleeds if you want to.
Tank Evans is not scared of some little forest critters.
Neither is my main girl, Michelle.
Isn't that right, baby?
Big Daddy won't let anything harm you.
This is Michelle.
We've been together for about...

Three years now.
I bought her at a garage sale.
I saw her from across the lawn.

Don't get me wrong, I still ride other boards.
But...

Hey, Tank.

Yeah?

Yeah.

I ain't afraid of no forest critters.
- Totally cool.

So we're all fine down here.

Mmm.

Don't let the bed bugs bite.
Oh, we won't.
And the bed bugs will bite you.

Uh...
Hm?
Don't hate me, man.
I'm just polishing my trophy.
I think I just laid an egg.
I didn't forget about you, babe.
Oh!

Whoa!
Nice hang time.
Cody?
Congratulations.

What?
That's what happens when you don't work together in a place like this.
Wait, wait, wait.

It was.
We wanted to see how well you work under pressure.
Never split up.

You stick together, no matter what.
When you're a team, you always have each other's backs.
Got it?
Well, all things considered, not bad for your first time.
At least none of you peed your pants.
Right, Hunter?

I told you guys, I sat in a puddle.
- Oh, yeah.

Don't worry, Hunter, bro.

- I don't have any pants,

So I mostly just peed on my feet.
I bet you thought it was me making all that noise.
Didn't you?
Yeah.

Can't sleep?
Yeah, I think I need a minute to calm down from all the excitement.
My heart's jumping out of my chest.
Yeah, I can imagine.
This has been some day.
Must be a pretty big deal to you.
This is my dream, Lani.

I don't think I blinked once all day.
I didn't wanna miss a second.
Mr. McMahon thinks you're amazing.
He's totally gonna pick you.
Mm.

I miss Pen Gu.

I can't wait to tell our friends back home about all of this.
Heh, heh.

I wish every day was like this.
I feel like I'm finally living the life
I've always wanted to, you know?
I wish this feeling could last forever.
Heh.
Yeah, well, you still gotta sleep.
Yeah, in a minute.
Let's soak this in a while longer.
Uh...
Uh!
Cock-a-doodle-dude!
Cock-a-doodle-shut up!
I slept like a corpse.
Come on, guys.

Remember what we talked about last night.
After all, this journey isn't just about getting to the Trenches.
One of you will be replacing me on the Hang 5.
Those are some big shoes to fill, so show me you've got big feet.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

It says there's supposed to be a bridge.
- Boss!

- Wait, wait.

- Rerouting.

- What's that mean?

Hey, what's the holdup?
Hm...
Ha, ha!

Oh, yeah!
Whoa.
Whoa.
Ooh.
Let's have some fun.
I bet you can't get past me.
Oh, you're on.
Whoa, whoa!
Perfectly matched.
This is truly a clash of the titans.
Yeah!

You see that?

Come on, J.C.
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

Yeah, he showed Hunter what's up.
Come on, Lani.
Whoa.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Yeah!

Ha-ha-ha.

Oh, that's cool, but...
Come on, wimp.

Hope you don't fall to your death or anything.
Whoa, whoa!
Can you do this?
- Cut it out!

Is this bothering you?

Cody Maverick looks like he's in real trouble.
I can't look.
Ha, ha!

Tank, seriously, stop.

Okay, okay.
Dude, come on.
This is fun.
Uhn!
Ha-ha-ha.

Ooh.
No, I'm good.

Yeah!
That was gnarly.

Oh...

Cody, no!
Look out!
Wait for me, guys!
You okay, Cody?
Yeah.
Fortunately, this solid stone floor was here to break my fall.
Where are the others?
Whoa.
Looks like we're in some kind of a tomb.
Yeah.

I think these little symbols mean something.
Maybe it's a story.
Yeah, see?
This one's about a guy who surfed a wave as tall as a mountain.
And this one shows a guy surfing on sand.
We did that.
Hey, check it out.
Whoa.

It looks like the story of a young penguin.
Pretty good surfer, got some fans.
Yeah, definitely looks like things were going his way.
Yeah, yeah, and then?
Oh!

Oh!

Whoa.
This guy surfed through fire?
Dude, that's hardcore.
Hey, this isn't a tomb.

Oh, man.

Do you think people will remember you like that?
A legendary surfer who did all these amazing things?
Jeez, I hope not.
Really?

This is what I've always wanted.
To be remembered as a legend, somebody respected.
You know, like a real winner.
Not me.
I want to be remembered for who I am, not what I did.
Look, Cody, surfing's awesome and all, but there are a lot more important things in life.
You'll see.
I just want to be remembered.
Lani, Lani, it's okay.

- Paige.

Yeah.
Hello?
Cody?

Conch?
Chicken Joe?
Uh-huh.

Oi, over here.
Is everyone okay?
Uh-huh.

There's a little doodle of a door on this wall.
Do you guys see a lever on your side?
I see it.
Whoa!

Are we glad to see you guys.
Come on, let's go.

Stop.

There are lost souls lurking around every corner.
I can feel them.

What kind of idiot would steal from a freaky place like this?
Ha, ha!

Look at how rich I am.
I wonder how much gold we can pack on the whale.
Let's come back with a bigger whale.
No, 10 whales.
The conch says...
There's no reception in here.

Let me see if I can get any bars.
All right, there we go.

According to the conch, the penguins on this island used to worship surfing.
We're in the treasure room of their king, the wealthiest surfer who ever lived.
Heh.

Mmm...
Michelle, we have had some good times together, but I think we both know Tank Evans deserves better.
Don't worry.

Time to hit the road, babe.

Hold on a second.

We take anything, we die.
What?

Well, I didn't get into this for the money.
Easy come, easy go.
Hey, Tank.

This place is booby-trapped.
Huh?

Michelle!

We've gotta get out.
Let's go!
- What's happening?

But let's not wait around to find out.
An old aqueduct.

Come on, Cody.

Whoa!
Oh, yeah!

Watch out for the darts!
Shield yourself with your boards.
Stay together.
Oh, look out!
Ow!
Aagh!
Oh!
Which way do we go?
Follow me.

I hope Cody made it out.
Don't worry, love.
If we made it out, they'll be fine.
I love all you guys.
Uh...
Are you okay, big guy?
I feel very peaceful.
Must be the acupuncture.
That's a pretty posh board, Tank.
What?
You didn't take that, did you?
No, no, no.

Why all the fighting?
There you are.
Oh, Cody.

- Oh...

What's with him?
Enjoy it while it lasts.
See, this is the kind of white-knuckle adventure the power diva is all about.
Imagine, me and, like, 11 of my besties traveling the world and kicking butt.
But also making time to hang out by the pool and gossip.
And at the end of every episode, I'll slap somebody.
It'll be a huge hit.
Mm.

Hey, guys.

Great.

I saved you some dinner.
Uh...
Oops.

Was I not supposed to eat that?

Aagh!

You snooze, you lose, bro.

Came up with that myself.
I may change it to Hankiest later.
Here, Cody.
I picked these fish heads out of the trash.
I think there's still some meat in this one.
Nah, I got a better idea.
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop that!

You're dead.
Yeah.
Whoa!
Uhn!
Is that all you got?
Ugh.

Heh-heh-heh.
Ugh!

Whoops!

Ha, ha!

Ooh, my tushy!
Not cool, bro.
You can't trip my guy like that.
Oh, yeah?

It's been a while, dude.
You think you can still handle it?
Come on now, you can't see me.
Yeah.

Ow.
Yeah!

Whoo!
All right.

It's supposed to be their fight, remember?
Yeah!
One, two, three.

Ha!

Oh, that smells.
That was fun.

I leave you alone for 10 minutes, and this is what you do?
I expect rookie mistakes from rookies, but you guys know better.
And, Cody Maverick, we'll never get to the Trenches if you keep starting fights with your teammates.
Ah!

Oh, wait.

Oh, my bad.
So other than getting sat on, how do you think you're doing?
Okay, that was not my fault, man.
Hunter called it too early.
I had Tank right where I wanted him.
Uh-huh.

Where, on your head?
That's besides the point, all right?

Anyways, my head is still in the game, if that's what you're asking.
This is my one big chance to get off Pen Gu and make something of myself.
I'm gonna show the Hang 5 I've got what it takes.
And I've been working out too.

Uh!

Oh, okay.
Can you please go get J.C.?
Cock-a-doodle...
You're gambling with your life, chicken.
Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

Good news, everyone.
According to the conch, we might reach the Trenches by nightfall.
Then tomorrow morning, it's RTL.
- RTL!

Is anyone ever gonna tell us what that means?
What?

Hey, guys.

Anyone else get the feeling this island really doesn't want us to reach the Trenches?
Ideas, anybody?
We sure didn't come this far to give up now.
The conch says unless we can surf on fire, we'll have to find another way around.
But this lava lake is huge.
Come on, Cody.
Surf... on fire.

Hey.

When we were stuck in that tomb,
I saw some drawings about a penguin who surfed through fire.
I thought it was just a cool made-up story, but what if it's not?
What if somebody actually did it?
I have an idea.
It's crazy, but I think it just might work.
Spit it out, kid.
Undertaker, quick, give me a boost.
Who's up for some hang-gliding?
Yeah!

Let's go!

All right!
Hey, Cody.

This is the kind of creative, out-of-the-box thinking we need in Hang 5.
Ha, ha!

This is what I've been talking about.
I've got all kinds of ideas.
Like dolphin-powered jet skis.
Underwater breathing devices.

What if we put wheels on our surfboards so we can surf on dry land, huh?

Whoa, wheels on a surfboard?

Keep up the good work.
Did you see that?
I'm gonna be in the Hang 5 for sure.
So who's the loser now, huh?
Whatever, chump.

Oh, not according to Mr. McMahon and Hunter.
You better start packing your bags, Tank.
Because tomorrow, I'm gonna be part of the Hang 5.
Traveling the world, doing the most radical stuff.
And you'll just go back to being a nobody from nowhere island.
And you'll never see me again.
What?
You don't wanna go back to Pen Gu?
What about our surf school?
Lani, come on.
It's the Hang 5, okay?

I'll be a hero to millions of kids.
But you're already a hero to the kids back home.
And to me.
This is different.

I'll be on the best surf team on the planet.
I'll finally be somebody.

Hey, Cody.

Coming, J.C.
Come show me how this thing's supposed to work.

Eh...

I guess we're just a couple of nobodies from nowhere island.
Let's be safe, guys.
This ain't the ocean.
If you wipe out up here, you'll be a bucket of extra crispy.
Oh, man.

You're going down, twerp.

You are not gonna take my spot on the Hang 5.
Okay, let's see what you got.
On your mark.
Get ready.
- Hey, watch it, man.

Go!
Yeah!
Oh.
Hot, hot, hot.
J.C. Whoo-hoo!
All right!
Ugh.
Loving the lava.
There you are.
You're gonna eat it, Tank.
- Show me what you got.

- You like that?

Hey, that's not fair.

This is fun.
Huh?
Wait, I'm first?

I'm first.
Payback time.

Oh!
Whoa!

Whoa!
Grr...
Oh, you are not taking this away from me, Tank.
- Got you.

Whoa!

How do you like me now?
Oof!

I don't want to be a combo meal!
Hang on, Joe!

Whoa.

All right!
Who's awesome?

What's going on, everyone?
The Undertaker saved me from death.
Ironic.
Where's your board?
You destroyed it when you bumped Tank into Joe.
What?

"Sorry" doesn't cut it, Cody.

Yeah, man.

All these years of friendship.

He still keeps these...

And I don't know how to break them down.
I just don't know what to think anymore.
Are you kidding me, dude?
This guy has been sabotaging me since day one.
And you think that makes it okay?
Well, I...

I was just trying to win.
So I could prove I can be one of you.
Putting your friends in danger only proves that you're nothing like us.
The Hang 5 is a family.
We have each other's back, no matter what.
Lani.

All right?

Yeah, Cody, I do.
And that's why I'm just so disappointed in you right now.
And you were doing so well too.
I told you from the start this kid's trouble.
He almost got the chicken killed.
That would have been on you, J.C.
Cody's not like that, Mr. McMahon.
He just got carried away competing with Tank.
That guy's been acting like a jerk this whole time.
I wanted to know how Cody deals with problems since you thought he was special.
And now I know.

That kid doesn't care about anything other than winning.
And he doesn't give two sand crabs about who gets in his way.
Maybe that's what you saw in him back at Pen Gu.
Have you thought about that?
Cock-a...
Oh, no.
You guys, come look at this.
"Joe, sorry for everything.

Your bro, Cody."
Ha-ha-ha!

Hey, is anybody else surprised
Chicken Joe can read?

We have to find Cody.
He couldn't have gotten that far.
That was pretty sad, bro.
Lani, wait.
I think you gotta let Cody work things out on his own.
He'll come back when he's ready.
But how can you be sure?
I've been where he's at.
Trust me.

Hmm.

The best waves come at dawn.
Uh, does anyone else think a storm is coming?
We're counting on it.
Oh, cool.

Whoa!
"Here lies the great hero of Slaughter Island,
"the bravest and most honored surfer of all.
"He gave up his chance at fame and fortune,
"and he chose to stay with his people to protect them
"from the treacherous waters of the Trenches by performing the sacred rites of Ride the Lightning."
RTL.
Oh, no.

Whoa!
My friends, we finally made it.
Behold, the Trenches.
Whoa.

Must have been some major wipeouts.
I'm not gonna end up like them.

Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for.
Hang 5, prepare to RTL!
RTL!
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me that RTL stands for...
Ride the Lightning.
Whoa!

Surfing during a lightning storm?
You actually planned for this?
Are you guys completely insane?
Well, yeah.
We figured you knew that about us.
Lani, we're all about pushing ourselves to the absolute limit.
And it doesn't get any more extreme than this.
I'm sorry, you guys.

Thank you for the opportunity, but no, thank you.
This isn't for me.
Hey, we understand, love.

What about you, Chicken?
Are you ready for a spot on the Hang 5?
I don't think I'm quite ready for that big chicken bucket up in the sky just yet.
Oh, hey.
How about an honorary membership?
Heh-heh-heh.

So how about it, Tank?
So, uh, all I gotta do is surf one gigantic 50-foot wave.
Yup.
It's in the middle of a lightning-filled thunderstorm.
Oh, yeah.
Also off a beach littered with jagged coral reef.
Exactly.
But then I'm in the Hang 5 and I'll be famous and make lots of money selling surf videos.
You gotta do more than surf it, you gotta survive it.
And make it look good.
You in or you out?
Um...

In.

Sweet.

Oh!
Oh, yeah.

Then let's RTL.
RTL!
Sweet!

I can't watch.
But I can't not watch.
I'm a lifeguard, Joe.
I'm supposed to protect all beachgoers.
I swore a Hippocratic oath.
Hah.

Are you sure we have to paddle out this far?
It seems far.
I can't even see the beach from here.
All right, here's how this works.
Don't panic.

And keep an eye out for each other.
And we'll all make it through this.
Whoa!
Here we go, Tank.
This is your last test.
Mr. McMahon thinks you're a yellow-bellied coward.
- But I told him

You were the real deal.

Or we'll all die.
Do not...

We're all counting on each other.

Okay, here it comes!
- Yes!

Come on, Tank.

Everybody, ready?
Yeah, I was born ready!
Oh, yeah!
Whoa!
- Ha-ha-ha.

This is the moment we've been waiting for!
Whoa, this is amazing!
Let's ride!
Yeah!
- No way, man.

No, I can't do it.
Tank, don't!
Stay in formation.

Don't let it touch you.
Unh!
Undertaker, I'm coming for you.
Look out!
We're not gonna make it!
Help!

Move aside!

Oh, I hope I'm not too late.
Whoa!

Oh, crap.
No!

Ah.

No!
Oh, man.

No!
Help!
Tank!

Hunter!
Hunter, Hanky needs you.
Hold on.
Oh, this is a bad idea, Maverick.
Stop fidgeting.
Go left.

You're doing it all wrong.
Enough with the backseat surfing, okay?
My mom's gonna be so mad at you if we die.
Come on.
No.
Hang on, Under-bro.
Clear.
Aaagh!
Now, that was gnarly.
You did it.
Oh, dude.

You okay, big guy?
Forget about me.

Ugh.
What happened to you?
He came back.
He risked his life to save Tank.
Oh!

Yeah, I know.
But it's like you said, J.C.
We have each other's back, no matter what.
I think you have something to say to Cody.
Thanks, Maverick.

So are we...

Uh...
Yeah, we're cool.
Awesome.

We should totally hang out.
Not bad.

That's what I saw in him.
Cody Maverick, you're one bodacious surfer.
But even more importantly, a good dude.
On behalf of the Hang 5, we'd be honored to have you join us.
Gnarly.
Joining the Hang 5 would be the biggest honor of my entire life.

No.
Wait, what?
Dude, are you sure?
Yeah, bro.

All this time, I thought joining the Hang 5, the greatest surf team, would make me a somebody.
A winner that everyone respected.
But now I know I'm already part of a great team.
With the coolest chicken of the sea.
And the best, raddest surfer on Pen Gu.
Tank?
Oh, right.

Friendship is truly the universe's most precious gift.
But what does this mean for us?

I'm staying.
Really?
Yeah, our adventures are too much fun.
Who wants to just drink fish milk coladas on the beach all day anyways?
Hey, you guys know what we've never done before?
Surfed during a tsunami.

Yeah!
All right!
Dude.
Ride the RTS.
Tsunami starts with a T, boss.
Oh, yeah.

Uh-huh.

So that's why everything tastes like me.
Thanks, dude.
All right,
Are They Still Cool?

Can you tell us what you've been up to for the last couple years?
Oh, it's been a crazy ride, man.
But first, I have a question for you.
Oh, no.

We're not gonna finish the show if you keep changing the script.
Are you a fan of the legendary Hang 5?
Wanna learn extreme surf moves like the tombstone pile driver from the Undertaker?
What about Paige's PTO?
Well, you can learn those and many more from Pen Gu Surf Academy.
At PSA, you'll learn how to have fun, be safe and surf like a pro.
Just like my friends, Cody, Lani and Chicken Joe.
Mention this commercial and receive a free case of fresh fish milk with your membership.
Ugh.
So stop by the North Shore and hang out with us.
That's Pen Gu Surf Academy.
Where the sun never sets.
Okay.

And cut.
You should learn to surf from a real master.
- Right, gang?

Ow!

I'll also teach you about teamwork and proper surf etiquette!
Okay, cut.
Wait, stop.
Stop.
Yeah.

We'll be there in four, three, two...

I picked this up for you while I was on tour.
Thanks, Joe!

I know how much you like these...

Um...
Undertaker, quick, give me a boost.

Oh!
