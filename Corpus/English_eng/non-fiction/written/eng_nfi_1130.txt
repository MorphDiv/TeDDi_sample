We were visited by Sir George Howard yesterday.
He dipped his biscuit, got as drunk as a lord, and left late in a hackney carriage.

Anyone knows something different, now's the time to say.

No, this way's better.
It's not better for me.
Howard and I fought in front of half the town two nights ago.
And I was seen at his house last night.
- Why did you go there?

You're a fool.
You have incriminated yourself.
Are you blaming me?
No.
What will you do, Charlotte?

She risks hanging if she stays.
You kill a man but it's me who has to run?

Alas, today, we realize what a high price you'll pay for her.
