[ Taps key ] It's a case.
[ Blows air ] Good.
Looks like a guy named Jarrod Hayes disappeared in Tomahawk, Wisconsin, a week ago.
No witnesses.

But Mick says this place has a history.
Meaning?
Well, it means a lot of people go missing in Tomahawk, one a year, every year, from 1898 to 1997, and then nothing until now.
So 20 years?
Yeah.

Maybe it's a cycle of some sort?
Well... one way to find out.

I'm sorry, but why the Feds interested in Jarrod Hayes?

Well...nothing much to tell.
Jarrod and his friends were hanging out at Weather Top.
This make-out spot the kids use out at the woods.
And then he ditched his pals to hoof it home.
Never made it.
So somebody snagged him?
Mm.
- Maybe.

Look, maybe Jarrod did get got.
We're working every lead.
But you ask me, he just bailed.
And why would he do that?

Mom left years ago.

Well, let's just say Jarrod âfell down the stairs a lot,â you know what I mean.
- Wait a second.

If you knew he was being abused, why didn't you ...
We tried.

Did you talk to his old man?
Can't.

Can you imagine having to spoon-feed the guy that wailed on you for all those years?

Hi!
âBlack Billâ is a local urban legend, dates back more than a hundred years.

Thank you.

Uh, back then, he was called âBlack William.â
So it looks like some time between then and...
Dude, focus.
I am focused.

All right, well, he lives in the woods, so he's like a local Jersey Devil.
And apparently, he has the head of a goat.
A goat?
Like... [ Bleats ].

Yeah, a goat.
Well, maybe that's what Daryn saw.
Unless you think he was lying.

Mm, nah, I think he's a little too freaked out to be lying.
So we got a, uh, goat dude with a name like a pirate, which is a little insane, even for us.
And that bar is...

So if it is real, what the hell is it?
I'm not sure.
I mean, there's tons of human-animal hybrid lore dating back all the way to ancient Egypt.
Right, well, why don't you figure out what the hell it is, and I'll figure out a way to kill it.

All right.

I already figured out a way to kill it.

Look, I know ...

And I liked him, too.
He was a-a valued employee and he was a friend.
Really?

'Cause after you put him on part-time, he pretty much hated you.
Well, I would say that that was his prerogative.
But you can't keep using him as an excuse to blow off work.

I have some idea what we're dealing with.
Look at this.
It's a satyr ... half man, half goat from Greek mythology.
Oh, come on.

He plays a freakin' flute.
Yeah, Dean.

Mm.
So listen, satyrs are creatures of uncontrollable lust.
They would lead people to the woods for massive orgies.
Nice.
And when the fun was over, the satyr would, âfeast upon the flesh of his victims until his belly was full to bursting with their moist, slippery meat.â
That's descriptive.

All right, what do we do?
Well, I was thinking that maybe we could go talk to Daryn, see if this is, indeed, what he saw.

Daryn never made it home from work last night.

I don't suppose he's around.
No, Daryn ...

[ Man speaks indistinctly ]
So when was the last time you saw him?
Oh, last night.

Talked about our big day today.
What big day?
You see that walking clipboard over there?
Sam:

He's trying to shut us down.
How come?

It cleans up pretty nice, but our equipment, it's a little out of date.
Can't you upgrade?

Business isn't exactly booming.
We had to shut down half the plant three months back.
Meanwhile, our owner would rather play sheriff than actually take care of business.

You're telling me that Sheriff Bishop owns this place?
Yeah.

Heir to the Bishop meat empire.
His family, they've owned this plant for...forever.
Barry's inside.

You ask me, it's too little, way too late.
Man:

Excuse me.
Sure.
So we roll into town, look into a case, talk to the local badge...
And then our one witness goes missing.

Are you still trying to chase down Jarrod Hayes?
Yeah, and, uh, now Daryn Boston.
Yeah.

Jeez.

Yeah.
So tell us, what have you heard about Black Bill?
I'm sorry.

Daryn told us he saw Black Bill attack Jarrod Hayes.
He didn't wanna tell ya 'cause he didn't think you'd believe him.
Well ... well...

Look, 'round here, parents tell their kids no to go into the woods or Black Bill will get 'em.
He's the bogeyman.
Everyone knows that the bogeyman ain't real.
Sure about that?
Seems like a lot of people go missing in this town.
Yeah, one a year every year up until '97.
Yeah.

I mean, people come to town, they work in the plant for a while, then they get bored and restless, and they, you know, move on.
And Daryn?
You know, maybe Daryn thinks he say Black Bill, but let's be honest.
Kid was drunk, high, or both.
And I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts,
Daryn's just holed up, sleeping one off.

Black Bill is definitely connected to the plant?
