Mrs. Winchester,
I believe you're drawn to danger.
Drink?
Have you talked to Mom lately?
Oh, shouldn't worry about your Mum.
Her and Ketch make quite a team.
Would you want your mom working with him?
Well, that was unexpected.
Dr. Hess.

I have been tasked by the other elders to fix this rapidly deteriorating situation.
Dr. Hess ...
These hunters are out of control.

The brothers Winchester, in particular.
* ...papers and effects *
* Against unreasonable searches and seizures *
* Shall not be violated, and no warrant shall issue *

* And particularly describing the place to be searched *
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go.
What?

Naw, dude.

Enjoy the show.
You know you're a freak, right?
Oh, yeah.
Cheers, bud.
Hey.
Ohh, man.

Daryn!

Hey, real funny, Daryn!
Ha ha!
Hey!

No.

No, no, no!

This is my voicemail.
Make your voice a mail.

Cass, it's me.
I've been trying to get ahold of you for days.
I don't know what's going on, but we got a line on Dagon... and we got our asses handed to us, even with the Colt.
So...could really use the backup.
Call me back.
So no luck with Cass, huh?
Yeah, still AWOL.
All right, so let's find him.
I've been trying, Sam.
The GPS on his phone is turned off, and there's nothing in the system about some weird guy in a trench coat getting arrested or turning up dead.
Right.
Dean, it's Cass.
I mean, this isn't the first time he's dropped off the map, you know?
And whatever's happening, he'll be fine.
He always is.
Yeah.
What 'bout you?
You got anything there, Reading Rainbow?
I stayed up all night, going through every book we have on demons, and it turns out we have a lot of books on demons.
Anything on Dagon?
Mentions here and there, but nothing we can use.
I guess the, uh, Princes of Hell are pretty good at staying off the radar.
Well, yeah, isn't that kind of their thing?
Hmm.

It's a case.
Good.
Looks like a guy named Jarrod Hayes disappeared in Tomahawk, Wisconsin, a week ago.
No witnesses.

But Mick says this place has a history.
Meaning?
Well, it means a lot of people go missing in Tomahawk, one a year, every year, from 1898 to 1997, and then nothing until now.
So 20 years?
Yeah.

Maybe it's a cycle of some sort?
Well... one way to find out.
Pew.
It's time.
I'm sorry, but why the Feds interested in Jarrod Hayes?
Just following' orders.
Yeah, um...
So what can you tell us about the case?
Well...nothing much to tell.
Jarrod and his friends were hanging out at Weather Top.
This make-out spot the kids use out at the woods.
And then he ditched his pals to hoof it home.
Never made it.
So somebody snagged him?
Mm.
- Maybe.

Look, maybe Jarrod did get got.
We're working every lead.
But you ask me, he just bailed.
And why would he do that?

Mom left years ago.

Well, let's just say Jarrod "fell down the stairs a lot,"
you know what I mean.
- Wait a second.

If you knew he was being abused, why didn't you ...
We tried.

Did you talk to his old man?
Can't.

Guy stroked out a couple years ago.
Breathes through a tube.
Guess who gets to take care of him?
Can you imagine having to spoon-feed the guy that wailed on you for all those years?
Everybody's got a breaking point.
If Jarrod did blow town, I wouldn't blame him.
You said that he was with friends the night Jarrod went missing.
Yeah, did any of them say anything?
Nothing worth repeating'.
Ain't he precious?
Uh-huh.

Oh, yeah.

Daryn Boston?
Agents Stark and Martell, FBI.
Hell.
Yeah, no, it's cool.
Medicinal purposes, right?
Uh...yes?
Yeah.
We just, uh, wanted to talk about the night Jarrod Hayes went missing.
What about it?
Well, the Sheriff says you were with him.
Yeah, well, the Sheriff is a jackass, all right?
Look, he thinks Jarrod just skipped town.
You don't?

Did you tell that to the cops?
Man, Sheriff Bishop's not gonna believe me.
We got...history.
History?
Any time something happens in this town, he brings me in for questioning.
Why is that?
Why do you think?

Well, look, if you won't tell the Sheriff what you saw, how 'bout you tell us?
Hey!

Look, I ran to save Jarrod, okay?
But...

The monster, it got him.
Monster?
Black Bill.
Hi!
"Black Bill" is a local urban legend, dates back more than a hundred years.
Warm it up?
Thank you.

Uh, back then, he was called "Black William."
So it looks like some time between then and...
Dude, focus.
I am focused.

All right, well, he lives in the woods, so he's like a local Jersey Devil.
And apparently, he has the head of a goat.
A goat?
Like... .

Yeah, a goat.
Well, maybe that's what Daryn saw.
Unless you think he was lying.

Mm, nah, I think he's a little too freaked out to be lying.
So we got a, uh, goat dude with a name like a pirate, which is a little insane, even for us.
And that bar is...

So if it is real, what the hell is it?
I'm not sure.
I mean, there's tons of human-animal hybrid lore dating back all the way to ancient Egypt.
Right, well, why don't you figure out what the hell it is, and I'll figure out a way to kill it.

All right.
Right.

What?
I already figured out a way to kill it.
How did you ...

The Colt.

Work smarter, Sammy, not harder.
Oh, don't do the hot coffee thing.
Boy, this coffee is hot.
Kind of like...
Hi.
What's your name?

Sorry.
Damn it, Pete!
Daryn...
I don't wanna be the bad guy here, but... you clocked in late.
Again.

And you're really painting me in a corner here, pal.
Look, I know ...

And I liked him, too.
He was a-a valued employee and he was a friend.
Really?

'Cause after you put him on part-time, he pretty much hated you.
Well, I would say that that was his prerogative.
But you can't keep using him as an excuse to blow off work.
Okay?

Okay.
Daryn, Daryn.
One more thing.
You gotta lay off the reefer.
All right?
At least for tomorrow.
It's a big day.
Aah!
Aah!

Yeah.

Yeah.

I'll see you later.
Okay.
- Mm.

Ahh.
- Good night?

It was an awesome night.

Ah.
You gonna eat that?
Uh...
Guess not.

I mean, would it kill you to order pancakes?

Okay, fine.

I'll deal.
How was your night?
Busy.

Right.

Yeah, little bit.
I have some idea what we're dealing with.
Look at this.
It's a satyr ... half man, half goat from Greek mythology.
Oh, come on.

He plays a freakin' flute.
Yeah, Dean.

Mm.
So listen, satyrs are creatures of uncontrollable lust.
They would lead people to the woods for massive orgies.
Nice.
And when the fun was over, the satyr would,
"feast upon the flesh of his victims until his belly was full to bursting with their moist, slippery meat."
That's descriptive.

All right, what do we do?
Well, I was thinking that maybe we could go talk to Daryn, see if this is, indeed, what he saw.
But?

Daryn never made it home from work last night.
No screwups, right?
Excuse me, sir.
Hi.

Uh, we're looking for Daryn Boston.
Uh, Daryn?

No, no, no, not at all.

Just wanna ask a few follow-up questions.
I don't suppose he's around.
No, Daryn ...

So when was the last time you saw him?
Oh, last night.

Talked about our big day today.
What big day?
You see that walking clipboard over there?
Yeah.

He's trying to shut us down.
How come?

It cleans up pretty nice, but our equipment, it's a little out of date.
Can't you upgrade?

Business isn't exactly booming.
We had to shut down half the plant three months back.
Meanwhile, our owner would rather play sheriff than actually take care of business.

You're telling me that Sheriff Bishop owns this place?
Yeah.

Heir to the Bishop meat empire.
His family, they've owned this plant for...forever.
Barry's inside.

You ask me, it's too little, way too late.
Mr. Garfinkle.
Excuse me.
Sure.
So we roll into town, look into a case, talk to the local badge...
And then our one witness goes missing.
Last place he was seen owned by the Sheriff.
Sound like a coincidence?
Oh.
You hungry?

Excuse me, Sheriff.
Agents.

Well, we could ask you the same thing, except...

Well, my name's on the paperwork.
Pete handles the day to day.
Are you still trying to chase down Jarrod Hayes?
Yeah, and, uh, now Daryn Boston.
Yeah.

Jeez.

Yeah.
So tell us, what have you heard about Black Bill?
I'm sorry.

Daryn told us he saw Black Bill attack Jarrod Hayes.
He didn't wanna tell ya 'cause he didn't think you'd believe him.
Well ... well...

Look, 'round here, parents tell their kids no to go into the woods or Black Bill will get 'em.
He's the bogeyman.
Everyone knows that the bogeyman ain't real.
Sure about that?
Seems like a lot of people go missing in this town.
Yeah, one a year every year up until '97.
Yeah.

I mean, people come to town, they work in the plant for a while, then they get bored and restless, and they, you know, move on.
And Daryn?
You know, maybe Daryn thinks he say Black Bill, but let's be honest.
Kid was drunk, high, or both.
And I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts,
Daryn's just holed up, sleeping one off.
Hell, he's probably waking up right now, safe and sound.
Hey!
Help, please!
Help!
Help me!
Well, Sheriff's not acting suspicious at all.
Right.
Yeah, but how is he connected to goat dude?
Now that's a good question.
Help!
Help!

Help me!

Help!

* Burgers and fries and cherry pies *
* It was simple and good back then *
Seriously?

After what we just saw, how ... how can you eat?
Grow up, Sam, okay?
Burger's beef, bacon's pig, Soylent Green's people.
But this ... this...
This is heaven.
Wow.
Right.

You find anything?

Yeah, kind of.
So I cross-checked all the names of the people who went missing with the employee roster at Billhook Meats.
And?

Try all of 'em.
All of 'em?

So I guess that means, safe to say that, uh,
Black Bill is definitely connected to the plant?
Yeah.

Or both.
Well, maybe they just run an evil petting zoo on the side.
So I, uh, spent some time at the Hall of Records.
The Bishops founded Tomahawk.
Everything.

If you lived here, you worked at the plant.
The Bishops owned all the houses, all the businesses.
Or they did until a few years ago.
Looks like the Sheriff has been selling off all of their family property.
Uh, everything, really...

...for the plant and the family estate.
Wow.

It's Mick.

Tell him we're cool.
So creepy house?
Creepy house.
It's clear.

Now remember your orders.
By the time we leave,
Dr. Hess wants to know everything about our "friends" the Winchesters ... their allies, their habits.
How does Sam get his hair so shiny?
How many ratty flannels does Dean own?
So work quick, work quiet, and leave no trace.
Oh, and apparently, Mick let Sam and Dean get their hands on the bloody Colt.
Find it, huh?
Looks empty.
Well, why don't we check inside?

Dean.
I'd say we just got lucky.
Wow.
Hello?
Goat dude?
Why is it always the rich ones?
I mean, what, are they, like, "Croquet's all right.
But you know what'd be great?
Murder."
Hiya, Sheriff.
Talk.
This is not what it looks like.
Really?
'Cause it looks like a straight up murder room to me.
Sheriff, what's goin' on?
Oh, you...

Try us.
We're pretty open mind.
My family, we... got a secret.
All the best ones do.
Is this about Black Bill?
No.

Black Bill, he's...us.
Come again?
Uh...
Growing up, my father'd tell me stories about a monster.
Lived under our house and made our family rich.
All we had to do was ...

Feed it what?

Human blood.
My dad, his dad, and all the way back, they'd go out and grab some poor son of a bitch, bring 'em here and...
When they did it they wore a mask.
Black Bill...
We made him up.
So goat dude is just a dude?
Then who's the monster?
Moloch.
God of sacrifice.
What, I'm sorry.

Yeah, one of my people way back, they bound Moloch, locked him away... starved him.
My family, that's what we did.
We let the god get so hungry that he'd do anything for blood.
Aah!
Moloch used his power to make us rich.
After my father died in '97, I put a stop to all of that.
Look, I couldn't...
I never killed anybody.

I wanted... to leave a legacy.
Well, aren't you just a peach?
So what happened to Moloch?
I kept him locked up.
Hoped he'd starve to death.
Locked up where?
It's empty.

It's empty.

Stay here.

What?

I'm cool.
Aah!
Dean?
Hey!
Hey!

Hey!
Here.

What are you doing?
I'm trying to track Dean's cellphone.
All right, got it.

Just as I thought.
Can't see a damn thing.
Mm.
Hiya, Pete.

I didn't expect to see you again, Agent.
I went to the house looking for my brother.
- Brother?

Different moms, same daddy.
Old man Bishop, he, uh, he had an eye for the ladies.
Everyone in town knew about it, but didn't make a difference.
Barry grew up in the big house.

Does that sound fair to you?
Honestly?

You got a lot of jokes.
Yeah, right now, that's about all I got.
Right.
You know what I got?
A god.
Moloch.
Bingo!
With Barry giving away the family fortune like that,
I had to get creative.
I went to the old house, trying to get my hands on anything I could sell.
But I found somethin' else.
Moloch.
He told me he'd make me rich.
He told me he'd solve all my problems.
All I had to do was feed him.
And hell, I'm a Bishop.
That's what we do, right?
Hunting people.

The family business.
Moloch's been starved for 20 years.
It's gonna take a few meals for him to get his mojo goin', but then...

Yeah.

Well, I'll tell that to Jarrod and Daryn.
Jarrod was a screwup.

And Daryn?

Loose ends, you know?
Loose ends.

My jackass half-brother was supposed to be the next meal, but you'll do.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
W...

Listen...

It'll be over soon.
Thanks for helpin' out!
What...
The sweep's complete, sir.
We've photographed and catalogued every inch.
And the Colt?

The Winchesters must have it.
Bugger.
Shall we go?

Just one last thing.
Now then, I could use a pint.
Pete!

Dean?
Dean?
Dean?
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Huh.
Pete!
You have to stop.
Don't act like you care.
I gave you the plant.
Aw, because you knew it was failing.

That's what I get.

Ah!
Not anymore.

I'm the hero.
And you're dead.
Mm.
Colt.
Dusts anything.
Hey.
How you feelin'?
Like I just went 12 rounds with a god.
So, you know...normal.
Yeah.

No, Sheriff, uh, we can help clean up.
No.
This...

It's on me.
This?
This is my legacy.
Hey.

Next time you hear me say that our family is messed up, remind me that we could be psycho goat people.
Yeah, that's true enough.
You know, I was... thinking about what Bishop said.
About...
What do you think our legacy's gonna be?
When we're gone, I mean, after all the stuff we've done, you think folks will remember us?
You know, like, a hundred years from now?
No.
Oh, that's nice.
Well, I mean... guys like us, we're not exactly the type of people they write about in history books, you know?
Mm.
But the people we saved, they're our legacy.
And they'll remember us and then I guess... we'll eventually fade away, too.
That's fine, because we left the world better than we found it, you know.
I wonder what's gonna happen to this place.
After we're gone, you think some hunter'll move in, keep fightin' the fight?
Yeah, I hope so.
Yeah.

What are you doin'?
Leaving our mark.
Here.
Hmm.
Guess we gotta call Mick, debrief or whatever.
Right.
Hello, Winchester.
Ketch?
Where's Mick?

He flew back to London last night.
After all the... oh, unpleasantness with Dagon and Renny, well...
Mick has a lot to answer for.
So for the time being, you'll report to me.
Seriously?
I don't like it any more than you do.
I'd much rather be with your mother.
Hunting.
For...chupacabra in Texas.
But for now, I'm what you've got.
So...

We fought a god and won.

We'll be in touch.
So now we're reporting to low rent Christian Bale?
Seriously?
I don't like that guy.

Yeah.
And he rides the oldest, worst, most unreliable bike.
