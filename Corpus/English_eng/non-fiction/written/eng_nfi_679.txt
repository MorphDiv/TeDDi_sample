I've been inside your brain.
I know what you want, or, rather... whom.
I still care about you, Fitz!
[Video games playing]
These aren't the droids
[Sighs]
[Grunts]
Yeah, fine.
[Music]

[Gasps] [Music]
[Indistinct shouting]
There's nowhere to go!
Surrender, and you will not be harmed!
[Gunshots]
[Clank, thud]
[Music]
[Panting]
[Electricity crackles, groaning]
Throw him in!
Let's go!
[Engine starts, tires screech]
Agent Coulson, this is Agent Koenig.
They've got Agent Koenig.
Any possible motive?
And now someone's made him disappear.
Can't be a coincidence.
May's the only one who would know I gave it to Billy, so I think we know where to point the finger.
Radcliffe.
He's been desperate to get his hands on that book, and he's had eyes and ears on this base for God knows how long.
But still, kidnapping a Koenig?
That's like catching moonlight.
We can't even find them half the time.
If Radcliffe has aligned himself with Nadeer, [Sighs] they'd have the resources to find him.
Why would he join forces with Public Inhuman Hater #1?
He has nothing against us.
She's got to be a means to an end.
He needs access and protection.
His Quinjet will be docking shortly.
Hopefully, Sam will have some more information for us.
If we can find who took Billy, we may be able to connect them back to Nadeer.
I'm not going to let this come between us.
What's the occasional bullet in the head among friends?
Done.
I'm right in front of you, and...
You've paralyzed me from the neck down.
You don't get to shoot first and ask questions later.
[Gun cocks]
We'll shoot whenever we damn please.
And this time, nobody's gonna put you back together again.
[Chuckles] What I meant is, I don't precisely know where I ... where Dr. Radcliffe currently is at this precise moment.
I could be out for a walk or getting groceries.
[Grunting]
[Door opens]
[Grunts]
You two will want to get acquainted.
You're the last one the other's gonna see alive.
I'm extremely not ready to die.
Cut off my fingers, eat my liver, it doesn't matter.
Nothing you do is gonna make me talk.
You must've sustained some brain damage
[Music] [Electricity crackling]
That was a greeting.
Now... the one who comes in this room next...
[Electricity crackles] [Gasps] ...won't be me.
[Music]
The man who comes in here will do things to you... that I can't even watch.
He will break you.
We're programmed to take pain, so bring it on!
Do you have any, uh, any, like, cyanide or ...
You put it over my head, you suffocate me really quick.
I work for S.H.I.E.L.D., too.
I'm afraid I'm the reason you're here.
I told them Coulson gave you the book.
That's why we're here, wherever here is.
[Music]
[Coughing] [Music]
Agent Koenig, welcome aboard.
Agent Coulson, Agent May...
No, they either evaporated or dove into the sea.
[Music]
But, oh, the things I saw... it was expanding my brain and my reality ...
[Laughs] [Door opens]
Yeah, maybe you should tell them where the book is.
[Wheels squeaking]
[Music]
[Door handle squeaking]
[Music] [Steps on metal floor]
I am the captain of this ship, and you are my prisoners.
If you cooperate, you will be treated as welcomed guests.
[Clatters]
[Music]
[Sniffs]
Mmm!
Vodka.
Perfectly chilled, pure.
The onion enhances the experience.
But people forget the old ways.
Now they'll put flavors in it ... vanilla... [Chuckles]
The old ways are better.
Modern machines ... all software, less hardware.
You put too much faith in them.
Man is the superior machine.
[Music]
And I love to make others feel it using the old ways.
[Breathing heavily, groaning]
Enough!
Senator Nadeer promised me he wouldn't be permanently damaged.
What do you suggest, Doctor?
[Music]
Let me get inside his head.
This is a complete and unacceptable invasion of my privacy. [Music]
Well, since you refuse to cooperate,
Fitz is going to reprogram you to sing like a canary.
That seems odd.
Singing I can understand, perhaps, but singing like a bird?
Why not Mick Jagger?
[Whirring]
What the hell is going on?
It's like fifth-generation syntax.
Every time I keep trying to alter it, it kicks me right back to the ...
Amicitiae nostrae memoriam spero sempiternam fore.
Uh, Fitz...
[Keyboard clacking] [Beeps]
[Exhales]
The only thing worse than a robot is a possessed one.
Where's Daisy when we need her?
[Music]
[Whistling]
I can't see their faces.
Da, I'm lucky to be alive.
I mean, you're ... you're literally wearing the same thing right now.
We have no idea what Billy did with the Darkhold.
I didn't want to know.
That was the whole point in giving it to him.
Well, we need to get it back and destroy it.
I wanted to protect you, and the Koenigs have dealt with this kind of thing before.
Maybe there's, like, a "Red Dawn" thing happening, but what does it have to do with Billy?
They don't want Billy.
They want something I entrusted to him.
[Music]
I don't care what this is or what you guys do.
I'm not gonna talk.
This machine will allow me access to his mind.
We'll get all the information we need without laying a hand on him.
Well, you're not gonna get anything out of me.
We've given him a Sedative Scenario to keep him relaxed while we map his cerebral matter.
That'll allow me to have a look around inside his mind.
This book better be worth it.
If you want to get rid of the Inhumans, the answer will be in it.
And what's in it for you?
[Music]
[Computer beeping]
I can't believe I'm sitting here with Quake!
And she doesn't love the name "Quake."
Did not need to know that.
Oh, well, you should Google it.
Actually, no, you shouldn't.
Some of it is a little on the steamier side.
Not that I've read it!
I mean, they got you 'shipping with Black Widow.
Ex-SVR, Special Ops...
The same Special Ops division the two men who tried to assassinate the Director were in.
They all have ties to Prime Minister Olshenko.
The Russian Prime Minister who was attacked by an Inhuman ...
We got Nadeer, International Watchdogs,
Yeah, that's why they want the Darkhold.
[Music]
'Cause it'll show them how to wipe out the Inhumans.
You knew Billy had the Darkhold?
Well, yeah, I couldn't say anything with all the Red Shirts hanging around.
Fitz, it's not Radcliffe.
Betrayed me, betrayed S.H.I.E.L.D., he made me lie to you, and he made me think he was my friend.
You can do it the easy way ...
Why don't you just turn him off?
Ward, who you thought was your friend,
[Sighs]
It's not him, it's me.
That's your father talking.
Isn't that what he used to say to you?
Not enough, not smart enough?
[Chuckles]
Why would you say that?
Because I knew him.
[Music]
Glasgow isn't that big, Fitz.
Your father and I were classmates, St. Mungo's at Eastwood.
How would Radcliffe know those things?
It's playing mind games, trying to distract you, because it knows you'll crack the code.
[Simmons' voice] "Where's Daisy when we need her?"
That's not what I meant.
Let's wipe its memory, give it to Mack.
We'll find Radcliffe another way.
Sometimes we sat together.
One time, he showed me a picture of his new son, Leopold.
I saw him a few months ago.
He said I was to tell you ...
[Beep] [Shutting down]
[Door opens, closes]
Please be patient.
While we're waiting, perhaps you could tell me why you dislike the Inhumans so much.
Yes, some of them are monsters, true, but ...
These Inhumans... they did not suffer, labor to become what they are.
They are unnatural things.
We will destroy them... and then the thing that brought them upon us.
You may now enter his memories.
One thing at a time, Doctor.
[Music]
What?
Take him to the brig.
Aah.
[Grunts]
[Door opens]
[Keyboard clacking]
Take me to the Darkhold, Agent Koenig. [Sighs]
[Music]
[Music]
We have to assume he's gonna get the information out of Billy.
This isn't right.
I'm in his head, but I'm also seeing him.
Doesn't make sense, unless...
[Music]
You sent us after the wrong man?
You just said Billy gave it to you.
I gave it to Agent Koenig.
We have to pick up L.T.
I don't think any Koenig is safe right now.
How's Fitz doing?
That Rad-Bot was really getting under his skin.
Oh, he'll be fine.
He just needs some space at the moment.
Always telling Fitz he was stupid and worthless.
I think that's why Fitz became so clever.
[Sighs]
I'd like to have a few words with that man.
[Sighs] You and me both.
But he walked out on them when Fitz was 10.
He hasn't seen or heard from him since.
So you're telling me with all the tools and tech that S.H.I.E.L.D. has at its disposal,
[Chatter]
This is L.T. Koenig's last known location.
And one crazy-ass handy-bun mustache.
[Horn honks]
I guess we should be grateful.
After all the years, all the missions,
After all that, we're still standing, the two of us. [Chuckles]
Maybe we should toast to that.
We've been, uh, making a lot of toasts lately.
Maybe we should try something else.
[Music]
Guys, I think you need to get in here. [Sighs]
[Feedback]
Welcome to the inside of my mind, Sheeple.
You guys watching any, uh, any good programming lately?
You know why they call it "programming," right?
Because you're being programmed through little screens, big screens, little morphine drips of sequels and prequels and zombies and Kanyes,
Snapchats and Grumpy Cats, all designed by the media, corporate S.H.I.E.L.D. machine, and you're asleep, binge-watching the Apocalypse!
You know what Tony Stark's armor is powered by?
[Music] [Grunts]
Drop your weapon.
You were doing that all by yourself.
[Grunts]
Billy's in trouble, and you could be in danger, too.
[Music]
Agent L.T. Koenig.
Sorry about kicking your candy ass.
[Music]
You ICE'd me!
She ice'd me, and now I'm aboard your War Bird!
Stop being a whiny little bitch.
We brought you here for your own protection.
I don't want anything to do with your Agents of Doom.
What happened to you?
We had the same parents, same teachers, same liquor cabinet.
Your brothers toughened up, joined the cause ...
Yeah, that worked out great for Eric.
He'd be alive if it wasn't for you!
Eric died so good people could live and do good things.
What good have you done for the world?
Okay, okay, guys, guys, hey.
Eric wouldn't have wanted this.
So let's bring it in for a little Koenig Krush.
Oh, God!
Didn't I teach you anything?
We can't let you leave 'til we know what's going on.
These gentlemen will take you to your room.
If you need anything, just let them know.
[Music]
Okay, so, after they left the SVR, our Russian bad boys were employed as security officers for a weapons-manufacturing firm linked to... this guy ...
Anton Ivanov, a reclusive industrialist with interests all over the globe.
Could be the source of Nadeer's financing.
We find him, we find Billy, maybe a way to bring down Nadeer.
I gave it to Billy.
Pass it back and forth, keep it moving.
Billy was the last to have it.
So my guess is, he put it in the Labyrinth.
It's a top-secret S.H.I.E.L.D. vault.
[Doors whirring] [Music]
94573.
99438.
I give the orders on this ship.
Now, let's not lose our heads.
What seems to be the problem here?
You put too much faith in machines.
I'm going to go get the information out of him my way.
[Music]
[Bones cracking]
[Grunts]
[Grunts]
[Bones cracking]
Aah!
[Music]
You brought an Inhuman on my ship?
She's a machine.
Aida, release him.
[Music]
Simple, built to last.
[Music]
[Knock on door]
I keep telling myself I don't care if Radcliffe knows my father,
I'm over it, but... [Sighs] maybe I'm not.
[Sighs]
I don't see it that way.
And after everything you've been through, no one would blame you if you put up your own firewall.
Maybe that's why it keeps happening.
It's why I fell in love with you.
Who you really are, that's not programming.
It's something way beyond that.
[Music]
[Beeps, energy hums]
Just you and me now, Tin Man.
You don't mess with my buddy and walk away from it.
If you shoot me now, it'll be murder.
You're just a bunch of ones and zeroes, not flesh and blood.
That's just biology, and biology is just...
But I have something you will never have ... a soul... that will continue long after I'm gone.
How can you be so sure I don't have one?
If a soul doesn't come from your flesh and blood or my ones and zeroes, then it has to come from somewhere else, somewhere unrelated to our physical bodies.
If you can have one, so can I.
You are a sly one, aren't you?
If you don't think I'm alive and don't have a soul, then why did you feel the need to switch me on before killing me?
[Gun cocks] I like to hear robots scream.
[Panting]
I know a way around his programming.
[Drill whirring]
If you don't stop, you're gonna cause irreparable damage.
You'll never learn what your father said.
You want to tell me what's going on?
Something Jemma said.
What do you need to know?
He couldn't crack the code because it wasn't a code.
You ... you ... you telling me thing is a... alive?
All I'm saying is...
[Music]
[Exhales sharply] ...it has a brain.
[Music]
L.T., stay with Quake and Agent May.
Agent Coulson, come with me.
I'm going with them.
[Music]
So, what was it like growing up with four of them?
There was a lot of crying.
Enough DNA to make a clone army.
[Music]
[Keypad beeping]
[Doors unlocking] Okay.
[Sighs]
[Music]
So... read any good books lately?
Imagine how big our brains would be if we had time to read them all.
It's made of light, but it's functioning like a corporeal, biological brain.
Quantum energy storing data ...
I wish I could take credit, but this was all Aida and the Darkhold.
Everything in the original brains ... memories, knowledge, desires ... is contained in the quantum brains.
[Music]
Radcliffe mapped another brain.
You can't be serious.
It was May.
[Music]
I never read "Ulysses."
I always wanted to take a month off, go to Ireland, read it in pubs.
[Chuckles]
Someday.
Maybe we should go together.
Yeah?
It's a little nerdy.
Did you mean it when you said you're ready for whatever comes next?
[Music]
We've got company!
Three men, armed, heading our way,
No need for you to be the target.
May?
[Music]
[Gun cocks] [Music]
I can't.
This is the right thing to do.
Leave me alone, and I'll take care of it.
Now lower your damn weapon
'Cause it's not in your programming.
What are you talking about?
Because there's some things you can't fake.
He switched you, didn't he?
How long have you been...
[Music]
So this is what Radcliffe programmed you to do?
I didn't know what my mission was
I am the real May!
Her thoughts, her memories, her desires...
Radcliffe made some adjustments.
[Rumbling] Aah!
[Grunts]
So, May's a freakin' robot.
[Groans] [Rumbling]
[Cracking] Aah!
[Gunshots]
Go.
[Grunts] [Music]
No!
[Music]
Give us the book, I'll give you your brother.
I've never seen this guy before in my life.
You want the book?
[Music]
Let him go.
[Music]
[Rumbling]
[Icing shots] [Music]
So cool.
Grab Billy and let's get to the Quinjet.
[Rumbling]
[Gunshots]
[Gunshots]
[Grunts] [Music]
Hello, Agent May.
[Music]
Mission accomplished.
[Chuckles]
This is exactly what you were supposed to do.
I'm eternally grateful.
You weren't built to last.
[Door closes] [Music]
The Labyrinth is compromised.
The deadliest tome in the world is in the hands of a mad scientist, who snuck out the back door with cattle-prod man.
I'm... sorry we let you down.
We now have the name of the man who kidnapped you, who's probably been funding Nadeer, maybe even Radcliffe.
Now we can hunt them and stop them.
Yeah, put us to shame.
Sam and Billy were part of the original LMD program.
Uh...
[Laughing]
Well, the Quinjet's ready when you are.
We'll get you home safely.
As always, thank you for your service.
Any time, Coulson.
[Music]
I hope this is the last of them.
There's still one more.
If we can't find the real May, then...
[Music] ...that's all that's left of her.
[Music]
Hey.
[Music]
To a success, though a narrow escape for both of you.
[Music]
Mmm.
The old ways always are.
You said you wanted to destroy the Inhumans and the thing that brought them upon us.
It's something I've been after for a very long time.
Every time something strange happens in the world, it is there.
I believe it is responsible for all of the alien problems on this planet ... the Chitauri, the Kree, Inhumans.
What is it?
[Music]
A man.
[Music]
He is always there... standing behind, out of focus... in the shadows.
And Mr. Shockley said he was there last night.
You can help me get to him?
[Music]
[Music]
