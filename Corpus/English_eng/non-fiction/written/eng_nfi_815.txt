Finally.
You know, I almost got away.

Bribed the Port Authority Â£15,000 to look the other way, only for all the crossings to be cancelled due to a freak storm.
Keeps happening, every time.
Made me realise... the bracelet doesn't want me to go!
It won't let me.

Time for something new.
- It's not a bad entrance.

I rather like this suit.
It's just a bet.

I think we both know the answer to that.
- If you want to learn, play the game.

- And?

Well, if you'd won, they'd be living in a palace.
Hmm...
Your risks are what make you great, Harry.
All right, Dr. Freud.
It's just water.
Oh, you are very bad news.
_
Harry?
Hi.
Sorry, sorry.

Not just you seeing Harry just as he's about to do something so...
Stupid?
...interesting.

You know, I was actually quite nervous about meeting you, Harry.
But I suppose this has broken the ice, eh?
- I'm amazed they let you in like that.

- Giovanni, the owner?

I'm sure you do.
- So, how long have you two been together?

Not yet.

Someone please shoot me in the head.
I bet you didn't have to wait, did you, Anna?
I'll have that gun when you're finished with it.
So, how did you meet?

Hardly.

You know, how she sees a case.

And then she knows how to present them to a jury so that they see the story just as she wants them to.
It's...

Shit, sorry.
Look, can we just order some bloody food?

How did you two meet?
Um, I was...
Yes, hello?

Really?
- I'm sorry, it's my job.

Great to meet you, Harry.
- Hopefully next time we'll, um...

- Hello.

Anthony Johnstone, 39 years old, died last Tuesday.
Is there a bin anywhere?

Just scoff it down!
No time to iron?
- So, Anthony...?

- Turns out he was killed by a blood clot.

Something strange turned up in the contents of his stomach.
What?
- Human flesh.

So we may have a cannibal on our hands.
How's that kebab going down?
No, not a cannibal.

What about the stomach contents?
Well, this fingernail made me suspicious, so I did a precipitate test which confirmed the meat is definitely human, but there's also pork with apple and onion, sage...
All right, Ralph.

I don't think Mr. Johnstone knew what he was eating.
Did you say sage?
Oh, pastry.
If Mr. Johnstone here had died of more obvious causes, then we'd never have known.
Indeed, he may have done it before, many times.
I'm sorry, done what?
Eaten a pie.
_
Thank you.

Two pence.
Human remains?

Mr. Johnstone's wife said he visited your stall most days.

Oh, yeah.

A bit snooty about the lamb and beetroot, though.
Not an adventurous type, you know?
- You think I did it.

W-What kind of sick pervert do your think I am?
The only thing I add to these pies is love.
Where do you get your meat?
Not some common supermarket, thank you very much.
- I put my heart into each and every pie.

- Smithfield Market, of course.

I don't have a regular supplier.

I'm ruined.

Well, it can't be her.

- A who?

The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.
You sing a bit.

- If you think I'm falling for that...

A neighbour heard screams in the street last night.
Further investigation led to this.
We haven't ID'd the woman yet.
She looks familiar.
Now, the plates are false, obviously, but then we found this.
We managed to clean up the image.
You don't see anything until he turns around and it's only for a split second.
- Oh, my God.

- Oh, no.

He's smiling.

DI Clayton.
I've just had the call from Daisy's school.
She's safe, she's been brought here.
No, they can take her home.

OK.
I've got officers on the door day and night, I've got a panic alarm being fitted, we've got plainclothes at the end of the street.
I know.

Your officers are scaring off my clients.
I could take you both home.
Explain it all to Daisy.
Right, can you wait by the car, please?

Look, I know you'll catch him.
You're a brilliant cop, if nothing else.
And I'll get Daisy to court, it's good she hears it from you.
- Thank you.

I thought you said he'd want to keep as far away from us as possible.
- I'll tell you when I catch him.

You've got luck on your side, haven't you?
I saw the bracelet on her wrist, Harry.

Does she get you, is that it?

Well, she's fun, at least.
I'll find him.

Good luck.
Nikhail Julian.

He's guilty of multiple murder, kidnapping, extortion, and blackmail.
He exploited his role as prison governor to build a criminal empire.
Well, this is our chance to put him away for good.
We can track the van using CCTV.

And we'll need to go back to the original witness.
Find out exactly what she heard.
- What?

Not with your personal history.
- My history?

- You know that.

- Who's running it now?

- I'll keep you informed at every stage.

Got a DNA match on the meat found in Mr. Johnstone's stomach.
What?
The human remains.

Are you kidding me?
Had to hire a pool car, huh?

So.

The human remains found in
Mr. Johnstone's stomach belong to a man named Adam Sykes.
This is his house.

Adam Sykes.

Apparently, it was a fluke we were able to get the DNA.
Normally, when meat's cooked and digested, you don't get anything, so...

Police!

Let's go.

Listen, I get you don't want to be here.
I'm not thrilled to be working under you either.
- That's your fault.

All right, so you're not responsible for any of the shit that's going down right now?
Anything?
We've got incomplete passports, false tax returns, gas bills...
Everything you need to set up a new identity.
But no forger.
No sign of a struggle, either.

Maybe.
The last time I caught Sykes, he was trying to flog forged bare bonds to Russian undergraduates from Imperial College.
When we nabbed him, his hands were covered in ink, his shirt was covered in his breakfast.
This place doesn't...
Can we get some Luminol and UV lights in here?
Good.
- Again, please.

Wait, go back.

Blood.

Well, if he was killed her, it wouldn't be a single speck.
- There'd be blood spatter and...

And there.

- Arterial spray.

- Some job cleaning that up, eh?

The meat for the pies.

Smithfield.
Right.

Well, if she had no regular supplier, and always paid cash...
You do know we've had police here searching already, yeah?
Find the bloke that sold her the mince, we're one step closer to the killer.
Brilliant.
Right, I'll start down this end.

Hello.
- I can't help you.

I might be looking for 40 kilos of lambs' brains.
You're a cop.
Wouldn't get anything out of anyone here.

- And how do you know I'm a cop?

Takes a certain type of person to recognise a cop.
Normally, someone who's been in trouble.
Some knife.

- It can cut straight through the bone.

I heard a story about some poor bloke, had his arm cut clean off.
How did that happen?
Didn't look where he was going, so I heard.
- Do you mind?

- We need some more, mate.

So what do you use to keep it all so spick and span?
Why do you care?
Oh, I'm just interested, you know?
Must be a lot of blood that needs cleaning up.
I just wonder what you use to make sure there's no trace of anything left behind.
Solarvac cleaner?

- Where do you keep it?

Oh, I fancy taking a peek at that.
- Bet it's spotless, too.

Come on, then.

Backup.

Harry, are you here?
Harry?
Who is it?

Needle in a haystack, Harry.
Al, Any luck?
- We found his van.

- Look at the plates.

It's the van Golding was in.
Looks to me like Golding's taken him under his wing, protected him and used him for his skills.
He kills his victims, he butchers them, and they end up in pies.
So the woman he abducted...
We need to find her, fast.
These cases are linked now, Harry.
What, you're saying I can't work on either case?
I think Sykes was providing a new identity for Golding, and once Golding got it, he got rid of Sykes to cover his tracks.
OK, stop.
What we don't know is why Golding didn't use that identity to escape.
Sir, I found out who the girl is.

- Golding killed her mother, right?

Wait, Harry, you-you knew her.

I don't know.
All right, Suri, dig out everything else you can find on Miss Alexandri.
Harry.
I'm fine, I'm going home, I'm not getting involved.
You knew who she was before I worked it out.
You knew, and you didn't say, did you?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

You doing stuff you shouldn't be, and me having to cover it up.
Suri, if I knew anything else, I'd tell you.
Ever since she turned up and you started wearing that bracelet.
What, this?

Ever since then, you've been odd.
And by the way, it looks really stupid on you.
Suri, please.
Why has he taken her?

Tell me so I can find her!
It's me, Harry.
Hi.

If you're here about your man Golding, it's a wasted trip.
- They already told me.

- Well, you're too late.

I've kept my distance.
- And yet, here you are.

I miss my brother.
Look, maybe when this is over and we catch him, we can go out for a pint?
Just like that?
Well, I'd be buying, obviously.
Rich...
You sounded so stressed on the phone,
I thought you'd appreciate a more soothing environment.
I haven't had a chance to thank you for your performance with my wife.
Wasn't that hilarious?

You set all that up?
I think you're meant to say, "But not as gorgeous as you."
You did.

I just wanted to see how you were with her.
I'd like to know what's stopping you from kissing me.
My torch has been kidnapped.

I don't know why, but I've been kicked off the case, so I'm on my own without any resources, and I have to find her.
Isabella.
I don't care.

What?
Eve is my torch too.
Yes, she's known about me and the bracelet all along.
Now, why didn't she tell you?
I, err...
I don't know why.
I had two children, Harry.
Two beautiful baby girls.
And she's the reason I lost them.

- Jesus, what happened?

Forget about her.
- What happened?

Isabella.

To keep Anna and Daisy safe.
- So do it.

The man who caught Eve cuts people to pieces.
Good.
That selfish little bitch has sabotaged your life.
- Right now, I don't care.

Please help me.
No.
- You'd do the same if it was Daisy.

You'd do worse.
- Stay away from me.

Stay away from me.
Boss.
- You said you'd be careful.

- I don't know how he found me.

That's the thing, the bloody thing.
Now he knows you, we'll never catch him.
I'll be more careful next time.
It can't work, unless we catch him unawares.
That was the only way to get him back here.

Just put him in that and wait for him to die.
It was the only way, the only bloody way.
No.

I keep telling you, you can't, you don't know anything.
It's over.
Right.

- What, because of some bloody bracelet?

Forget about Harry.

Right.

- No, wait.

I'll pay you after it's done.
- Stop!

I can help you.

- No, you can't.

There's a second bracelet and I know the woman who wears it.
She's stronger than he is.
- No.

If you get her on your side, you can do anything you want to him.
Just tell him to put down the bloody knife.

Suri, how do you suppose Harry just found the butcher?
- I'm working.

He didn't do anything I wouldn't have done, but it's always him.
- He's always the one.

- Hmm?

Uhh!
What've you got?
Last year, we froze Golding's bank accounts, assets, et cetera.
But he's obviously still got access to money somehow.
Exactly.

But the software's unreliable, so I'm hunting down guys that look like Golding, but aren't him.
It's a wild goose chase.
No, not necessarily.

You want to find Golding, you've got to look bigger.
Well, you're not here to preach the gospel, are you?
Not quite.
We're here to ask for your help, Isabella Augustin.
Goodness.

We'd like you to help us kill Harry Clayton.
May I see it?
Come get it, if you think you're hard enough.
Eve says you've been wearing it for ten years.
Says you can summon luck like it's your own personal genie.
Eve talks too much.
And she gave the bracelet to the wrong man.
I was always meant to have that bracelet, and I would have done so much more with it than Harry ever could.
I think he's growing into it quite nicely.
No.
His mind's too tidy.
Too black and white.
I think his mind is a little darker than you realise.
And he's good for me.
If what Eve told me is right...
You'd do well not to mention that girl again.
When Harry learns about your predilections, he'll come after you.
He'll hunt you down, and however brilliant you may be, he will win.
But not me.

I think Harry's falling for me.
And I think he'll love me in time, whatever my faults.
He'll only ever love one woman.
So what do you want?
You help me get the bracelet off Harry,
I get Eve to put it on me, and then... whatever you want.
- You'll kill him?

- And I could kill Eve, too, if you like.

I want to do that.
_
_
When my girls died, my body seized up.
Grief grabbed me, choked me.
I'd be walking down a road and see a child, and...
My legs would give way.
I thought at least the pain would one day pass.
In a way, it has got better, but...
Some days, I wake and it's a good minute before I think of them.
Then I think of Eve...
But I'll help.
Because it's you.
It's all I've got.
Help me find her.

It's killing me.
As you wish.
You used the cashpoints to find Golding, I then linked them with mobile phones being used in the area.
That gives us 340 matches.
We then ruled out any mobile phones not paid for by cash or using pay-as-you-go contracts.
- That brings us down to the three.

One of which is currently being driven up the M1.
Motorway cameras showed that to be driven by a 29-year-old female.
Another one was dropped down a toilet in a nightclub last night by a teenager named Aaron Holt.
And that leaves one.
It's got to be Golding.

We just need him to turn his bloody phone on.
And then we've got him.
- You're a good cop...

- ...for a wally.

Secondly, ditto.
Even though I'm sure you'd be a nightmare girlfriend.
'Scuse me?
Well, with your backhanded compliments all day, everyday,
I pity the... wally.
Shut up.
I think we're near.

_
We've got him.
Let's go.
Target located.

So, luck brings us here.
- You're sure?

This is the place.
_
We've found him.
Yes, we have.

Are you ready yet?
I just want to cut his arm off with one slice.
Well, I'm done waiting.

Right.

Now, Harry might die of shock.
More likely blood loss, actually.
Either way, once he's gone, you will give me the bracelet, right?
Eve, do you understand me?
Oh, dear.
Isabella, why?
Oh.

And still in love with your wife.

Do it.
And I was starting to like you.

It's much safer to feel nothing at all.
At least with Golding, I won't have to worry about that.
Oh, please.
Did you really think I would choose you over my lovely Harry Clayton?
Ahh!
You bastard!
Eve!
Bastard!
It's what you've always wanted.
Eve, don't.
- All my life.

- Watch me.

I will come after you, I will find you, and I will put you in prison where he should be.
- Then I'll kill you too.

- Make his pain last.

I know, but we're not monsters, Eve.

Please.
So I got him.

You have to start trusting me.

No, you don't.
- Harry, she'll hurt you.

- He was going to kill me.

He knows all the lies you told.
Harry, I promise.
- You've got Golding.

She's right.
You got what you want from me.

Come find me.

This is the end.
Yes.
An ex-prison governor behind bars?
They're going to do terrible things to you.
Harry!

- Smile!

- Â£2... Â£3 million!

Anna, we got him.
Yeah, it's over.

The cavalry have arrived.
Harry, what are you doing here?
What took you so long?
Still a lot of questions.
You shouldn't have been anywhere near him.
I was just out for a wee dander.
Yeah, you've already given me that utterly implausible story.
I was worried when I heard you'd found him first.
I thought you might do something stupid.

- Thank you.

Sure she is.
- I'm trying not to interfere.

- So I-I'm no expert on your personal life.

No, you don't.
I saw that last time she was here, the way she still looks at you, God knows why.
So you're not interfering?

Tonight, I believe she's at a ball with her new boyfriend.
And you're doing what?

You fool.

Win her back.
What are you doing here?
Waiting for you.
