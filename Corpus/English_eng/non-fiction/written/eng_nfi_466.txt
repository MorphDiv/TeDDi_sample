What if the asteroid doesn't hit?
I don't know.

You need to decide what's more important to you, obsessing over this theory... or us.
I'm going to the airport, and I hope you meet me there.
I'm wrong.
I'm wrong!
I can spend a lifetime with Evie!
Oh, my God, we've got to get to the airport.
Jesse, man, you just missed the exit.
We're not turning around, cuz.
Did you drug me?
Oh!
Hello, Mr. Finger.
The asteroid... theory.
It's a credible threat.
So, Mr. Finger, where exactly did this asteroid theory come from?
His name is Hamish Stegner, Jr.
Oh, but he also goes by the name Xavier Holliday.
Xavier Holliday?
Beard?

Mm-hmm.
I will be damned.
He has been chasing me down for months.
Has he shown this theory to anyone else?
He talks about it all the time, but people don't really take him seriously.
Okay, great... because absolutely no one can know about the reality of this threat until we have a plan in place to deal with the public's expected response.
Mass panic and chaos?
Exactly.
You share this information with anybody, and you will spend the last few months of your life in a prison for treason...

Hmm?

All right, do you have any idea where Xavier Holliday is right now?
It's kind of a soft "X."

Uh, have you heard of Doctors Without Borders?
Yeah.

Oh, no, no, no.
Their health care system is stellar.
Um, I got a bit of time off before my next assignment, so
I'm gonna go see the northern lights.

I'm not a selfless doctor, but seeing the northern lights has always been on my list...
