In a lot of ways I feel like a fool.
I left the Klondike 000 ounces.
It blew up in my face.
What I don't want to do though is let my guys down.
I want to put gold in every single one of their pockets.
000 ounces.
And that's what we're going for.
It's been a very different season without my grandpa here.
I always relied on him a lot when it came to big decisions
And it's tough without that guidance and wisdom.
Deciding to do a second wash plant is a tough call to make.
Rick really had to step up and he's done that.
But now we just have one goal left to achieve.
000 ounces.
Let go of me now!
On this season finale of "Gold Rush.
I feel our team is falling apart.
I will resign.
This is a really dark day for our mining company.
If we stop moving at this point we die.
We've just got to keep everything going.
frost.
shut her down!
Woo!

what's our season total.
You ready for this one?
Tony Beets has been trying to barge his 2nd dredge from Thistle Creek 100 miles down river so he can get it producing gold on his own ground.
It's still got warranty on it.
a crane and a barge big enough to transport the massive sections down river.
We're a taxi?
Narrator:

I found another pin.
stay down.
Tony.
Yeah.
This is from from Minnie.
you bet
Narrator:

You cannot move the dredge.
you can jump low
You think I like it?

It's even worse than you think.

You're not allowed to do anything there.
Your thing is dead in the water right now.
You have to get a land use permit.
No.

You're gonna get so many fines it's going to double the price on the dredge.
No.

It's not worth it.
You're gonna have to apply for the land use permit and then you'll move it next year.

000 ounces before the snow flies.
Wow.
man.
Narrator:

Freakin' awesome.
that's all virgin.
But at Sacramento
Dave Turin is struggling to produce half as much gold.
I'm depressed because there's no gold and everybody's frustrated.
I feel bad.

We got to get Sacramento paying but the gold's not there yet.
Narrator:

I'm a leader.

I'm 57 years old and
It feels like at times I'm just a... another worker.

And so I don't know.
It's been a tough year.
There we go.
Narrator:

-Todd.

If you guys can hear that stuff you got to let me know.
I can't hear anything.
what's up?
I'll go ahead and shut down and send Dave down there though.
you got a second?
Go ahead.
Fairplay shut down.
They're broke down?
Their loaders are broke down over there.
we could at least get Fairplay running again.
Save their ass for a little while.
Dave.
All right.

I can't believe it.
Kind of pisses me off.
Like every time they break down we have to shut down.
This is bullshit.
We're not producing as much gold.
Sometimes you got to sacrifice to keep the mother ship running.

shut this down.
I'll do the pumps and the bypass.
One of you's gotta stop.
Let go of me now.

-Let me down him.

Trey.
Dave.

Please fuckin' walk away.
I'm not gonna stop.
Shit.

Chicken shit.
Is that your best shot?
-Hey.
Was that your best shot?
No.
Trey?
Dave.

Let...

Fuck.

Fuck.

Fuckin piece of fuckin' shit like that.
Dave.

-Coward.

Knock it off!
Trey?
Trey.
Let's go.

What's going on?
Battle of two bad tempers.
Whose?
Dave's?
Dave and Trey.
Where are they?
Dave left.
Dave's with Andy.
he's with Andy?
-Dave..

Andy got him to fuckin' walk away.
No.

Did they fight?
They get in a fight?
No.
Fuck.
Dave.
get the...

no.

no.
Trey.
I got him.

-Trey.

Trey.
Dave's not fuckin' beating me.
Trey.

Leave right this fuckin' second.
stop.
Walk.

-Trey.

watch it.
let's walk.
let's walk.
please.
Let's walk.
Everything I own is on the line here.
it's mine.

you aren't.
no.

-Trey.

Chicken shit.

Trey.
Let's walk.
I'm not gonna take some back jumping fuck.
Let him up.
Let's walk.

Come on Dave.

please.
Fuckin' coward.
no.
no.
Oh shit.
Trey.
Look at him.

-Fucker's taunting me.

I'm done.
Just take me home.
-I'll take you.

please don't go yet.
I'm done.
He ran his mouth first.

Trey.
man.
buddy.
Aww.
I'm done done.

You're leaving or?
guys.

I didn't think it'd end like this but unfortunately it has.
but obviously... when times get tough and the pressure's there people's true colors end up coming through.

I don't know.
Dave was bringing us a loader.
Had no idea the plant was down because of the screen.
I don't...
The plant's down.
Why in the fuck am I bringing the loader over here.
got hot.
f" you.
that's not gonna fly.
I've gone
I'm not gonna go
I knocked his hard hat off and... told him "f" you and then that was it.
I don't know how it's gonna pan out.
I think for now it's best to just go our separate ways.
Todd and Freddy regroup.
But they don't want to be filmed.
He's got lightning fast hands.

I never saw it coming.
And you hit him in the back?
I never hit him.
I didn't.
you did.
I'm just glad nobody got hurt any worse than they did. he's never done a single thing I've asked him to do.
Not one thing.
He's showed me absolutely no respect.

a couple guy's tempers.

Think Freddy's gonna talk about it?
Nope.
-Bad day.

You guys stay away from us right now.
Narrator:

10 degrees below freezing.
Morning boys.

Parker Schnabel still needs three-quarters of a million dollars worth of gold to hit his season goal.
So right now we're at 3375
Which is a hell of a lot of gold.
That's 10 ounces more than we found last year.
We could walk away pretty damn proud of what we've done so far.
000 ounce goal and the job ain't finished until there's 4000 ounces in the box.
I'm feeling ready for a final push here.

yeah.

cause it's cold out.
right?
and both plants are gonna be a bitch to keep going like this.
So we just gotta keep everything going.
I think we're all game.
Good.

boys.

All right.
amen.
Big Red has managed to keep sluicing through the night.
Over at the Creek Cut
The night crew was forced to shut down Sluicifer It turned to ice.
that's just great.
there's a chance here this thing ain't running again. and chisel it away and...
Get that valve open.
there it goes.
There's a fucker.
This is our bypass.

see if we can't get it thawed out.
All right.
Aw that's not what we wanted to see.
this whole pipeline's gonna be froze up.
Not good.
is just put the torches on it and try and put some heat in it.
I think we're pretty close.
Mitch got the pump thawed out we think.
So he's gonna fire 'er up.
if that's the case..
she's gonna blow up.
Yeah.

Or send a big chunk of ice straight to the plant.
Yeah.
Neither one of them is good.
Fire in the hole. we're screwed.
Got water.
you ready?
Give 'er.
Conveyor's working.
let's see what it does.
first scoop.
Narrator:

We've got over 600 ounces to go but we've got to give it everything we've got.
Narrator:

you know?
This is a really dark day for our mining company.
And we just lost a full day's running at two months.
The problem is us.
We only have a little bit of time left and we're this close.
Dave.
The honest truth is that I fucked up today.
and I want to apologize to you guys 'cause you're my friends and I've worked with you guys for a lot of years.
and I made a mistake.
I'm 57 years old and I'm still fighting and I don't like it.
Walk away.

I know.
It's easy to just walk away.
I know.

I asked you to walk away.
what could have happened.
I think I failed this year.
And because of that I will resign
Just 'cause I
-feel like can't...

Wait.

I'm not asking for anybody's fuckin' sympathy.
I just think it's the best thing.
come on back.

I make a lot of mistakes.
You didn't give up on me.
You didn't give up on me.

You made me who I am now.
look at what you've helped me become.
are the...
You're the fuckin' greatest accomplishment.
'Cause I watched you grow.
You came to us as a skateboard kid.
I love you.
Dave.
Look at what you've done to me. and you ain't done yet.
So last this with us.
I want to hear from Freddy.
I've never been in that situation before and I don't want to be in that situation again.
'cause I care for both you guys deeply.
Truly in my heart.

Okay?
We got a lot of gold to get still and a short amount of time.
Everybody on board?
We can do it here.
I will finish what we started.
One thing after another.
Tony Beets had two ambitious goals.
Fetch his dredge from Thistle Creek 000 ounces of gold. he and his crew are heading back to Eureka Creek.
Tony.
Or you fight the whole way.
Narrator:

Ooh ooh ha ha h a.
He's in a big mood to get fired up.
This is usually when it breaks.
going backwards.
Bucket line is pushing.
Oh shit.
Buckets are frozen half solid.
Narrator:

Give it a sec.
perfect.
yeah.
It turns.
huh.
Got to defrost the plant. which explains why I'mstill here.
filled with ice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ah.
000 feet up in the Rocky Mountains
The Hoffmans have been shut down for 24 hours and they're struggling to get started.
All this ice is new today.

Our belt is freezing up.
These shutdowns are gonna hurt us.
We're going to try to fire up.
It's colder than fuck in this wind.
Kev.

Clear.
It's spinning.
Got it going.

I have no problem meeting Todd right now.

But I don't think that I'm ready to see Dave.
Trey.
I brought Dave.
I was hoping we could talk and maybe solve some things.
Mind if we get a bench over here.
man.
-It was tough.


-And I know it's been horrible.

And I know what Dave did and I know what you did.
But I want to end this thing right.
with the team and let's go get some damn gold.
-They say that there

There's guys that need gold besides you and me.
It's not gonna be easy. and uh from the bottom of my heart.

Totally wrong.

Dave.

Can we get through this?
Why don't you guys shake hands.
Try to get through this season.
Yup.

But the 300-foot pipe from the pond is frozen solid.
Sounds good.
Narrator:

-Okay.

Yup.
Narrator:

That'll do.
Kevin cuts a second near the wash plant.
These are very drastic measures but it's what we've got to do to make our total.
wow.

Cuh...
Tony Beets.
The tip sprays water forward and three jets back so it pulls itself through the pipe.
I've got this running about 170 degrees.
Yeah.

Narrator:

Three jets of stream point backward propelling the forward facing jet through the pipe.
This should melt the ice all the way up to the wash plant.

Kevin.
What am I doing?
Yikes.
Narrator:

But the water has still not made it up to the wash plant.
Narrator:

It's 10 degrees below freezing but Kevin's dredge and Monica's wash plant are running a total of 275 yards of dirt an hour.
there's really no stopping him.

Weather this year has been coming in quite quick.
it's not pissing down rain or snow.
blue sky means real cold this time of year.
It's rather satisfying busting up all this stupid frost.
Rick is fighting for pay dirt.
Every now and then you got to go all caveman on this fuckin' frozen ground.
Fuck you.
Narrator:

What the fuck was that?
man.
I can't even move it now.
you got a copy.
what's up.
I just heard a really loud noise coming out of the 700 here.
I don't know what it is.
I'll come down and take a look at it.
man?
I just took a scoop and swung it in the pile and I heard "pow pow pow.
Never heard that before in an excavator so I know that something's not good.
take it out of here if you want.
man.
really?
That 700 being down really fucks us.

Dozers aren't the machine to get pay to the plant with.
We don't have much of a choice though because we only have one running hoe and it needs to feed the plant.
It's a pretty long push but we'll just make it work.
Narrator:

The pressure is on Mitch to fix the 700.
Just drain the oil out of the swing drive.
This will be a good indication if we got something going wrong.
Uh huh.

man.

We're going to need to take a closer look at the swing drive.
I'm just pulling the swing motor apart here on the 700.
make sure it looks good.
it's a good sign so far.
this is called a sun gear.
See what we got going on.
that's not good.
Nothing left.
The sun gear is basically just destroyed.

Narrator:

From the center the sun gear drives the orbiting planet gears.
The teeth on the sun gear are stripped so the arm won't swing and the excavator is useless.
You can see all of the gears missing here.
This is pretty much a paper weight now.
that don't look good.
this is destroyed.
Ho ho ho.
So this ain't spinning no more.
but the 700's dead.
we're so fuckin' close though.

You're just gonna have to keep using the cats.

that's the last thing we need to hear.
I really don't like pushing pay like this but we'll do what we have to to keep the plant running.
Getting freakin' cold.
See all these pretty icicles are here.
let's fire up.
it's usually time to go home.

The dirt is poor but they're pushing hard for every ounce of gold they can get.
I think that the guys will come back.
That's what I want.
Narrator:

Todd is relying on the gold rich pay dirt at Freddy's Fairplay mine.
Shit.
Kevin.

Uh-oh.
Fuck.
Kevin?
I got the water.
(flapping noise)
Was that a belt?
it's not a belt.

No.
Something's burnt in it.
Frig.
It's hot.
Let's take a look.
geez.
huh?

Can't we rewire that thing?

Todd.
Todd.
Look at all this carbon.
It's fried.
See all the smoke coming out from inside the motor?
Obviously the windings shorted out.
I've seen this a thousand times.
It's shot.
Aw.
How long will it take to get a motor?
It's not a motor off the shelf.
Come on!
Narrator:

I never pictured it ending like this.
you know.
Leave with the weather.
Not the way I wanted to end the season.
Not at all.
Perfect.
Everything's going good.
The only fuckin' motor I can't find in the state blows up.
Just great.
huh?
We're done.
We got gold in the ground.
And we've got two days worth of pay in there that I bet's got 200 ounces in it.
At least.

It's sitting there ready to go.
-The gold's in it.

That's the problem.
What if I cut a road all the way from here clear to Double Trouble and we hauled that pay to you.
we're kicking ass.
If you think it'll work.
Cut the freakin' road.

Let's finish this with Double Trouble and get our thousand.
That's all we can do.
Do it.
Still hit it.
Andy'd walk it man.
Whatever it takes to get the road done.
By tomorrow morning we want to be running dirt.
So I've got to get these two mines connected as quick as I can.
It's our only option.

Narrator:

it's been a long day.

Sleeping.

Sacramento and Fairplay are now connected.
Got about
Two hours before the sun comes up.
I'm tired.
I'm going home and going to bed.
Narrator:

This is the most important pay that we ever hauled this whole season.
Narrator:

The final push.

today we're running.
This is definitely the coldest we've seen.
In an instant too.
it's like a slap in the face.
so...
Did you shoot a beaver and put it on your head?
man.
Not holding back anything this year.
we mean business.
(Rick is laughing)
Let's go get some pay out there.
Narrator:

000 ounces.
We've never failed yet.
we can't ever say never again.
Wash plant's just one big shower you know and... so if something happens we've got to catch it quick.

huh?
We're fighting for every bucket we put through this thing.
The pay dirt that we have to run is this gnarly frozen shit pile.
The pile itself is so frozen solid for fuck sakes.
you got a copy?
Rick.
man.

man.

I'm digging in a five foot deep puddle.
I can't see fuckin anything in front of me here.
Fuckin' bullshit.
Fuckin' shit.
Shut 'er down!

fuck.
I don't know.

again.
shit.
man.
is it ever.
Just big fuckin' chunks.
Sketchy man.

Be careful.
Watch out!
Fuckin' ice block.
We can't keep running this shit.
we'll kill ourselves trying to keep this thing going.
This ain't the safest thing in the world.
Let's get off this death trap.
I'm fuckin' beat.
I'm right there with you.
I think we should just call it a night.
Yeah.
Shut er' down.
man.
you too.
so time for another nap.
[ horn honking ].
Parker and Rick are back for another day fighting the Klondike winter.
That was a pretty rough night last night.
no doubt.
We'll just see where we're at.
Well the water's still moving.
The wash plant doesn't look like it wants to move.
that's a fuckup.
That's pretty bad.
I don't even know how there's still water flowing through all that ice.
Fuck.

but it's so cold everything has frozen solid.
I don't know what to do.
We've ran in some cold weather but this is next level.
all this exposed metal it's just sucking that cold right in.
Narrator:

man.
I just don't think that this thing's runnable.
do a cleanup.
Hope we got what we need.
Sometimes you just got to know when to walk away.
We're there.
I'm gonna go fire up the generator.
All right.

Narrator:

For three days they've run Fairplay dirt through the wash plant at Sacramento.
Everything's frozen up pretty good.
baby.
and it's a battle to fire up the equipment.
there's not much water coming in.
Oh shit.
This is our intake water right here.
It's dry.

It's just about empty.
-Todd.

We got nothing.
right?

So you don't want to fire up?
we can't.

-Let's go up the creek and take a look.

Narrator:

far above the snow line.
That looks like the valley right there that goes into Sacramento creek.
take a peek.
this is nuts.
This doesn't look good at all.
That's the head water right there.

Holy cow.
She's froze tight.
but I think it's over.
We have worked so freakin' hard.
We're so close.

000.
Hope we can get it out.
the big freeze has also shut down Kevin's dredge and Monica's wash plant.
the whole fuckin' thing's frozen through.
but they've only managed to sluice for 5 days.
Well.
Narrator:

Some of the things you couldn't do anything about either.
The total right now from Eureka is 1942.

Yeah.
So we need 58 more ounces all total.
And seeing as Kevin was bragging he was gonna get that.
I think I did.
Let's see what the dredge has.
Okay.
Good luck.
Let's see what it is.
That's it.
Bullshit.
That's it.
Where the fuck is the rest of it.
It's in the ground still.
How much is it?
44.1
That's not good.
So all we need is 13 more ounces.
are you getting jealous.
So how much gold is in there?
So I would have completed without Kevin's gold.
So the combined total between Monica and Kevin 2176 ounces
Which is actually really really good.
Narrator:

It's nice to send you guys out and you all come back with gold.
I think you should keep that up.
I'm not going to cry about a wash plant.
It's a piece of steel.

I'm glad it's over.
I'm gonna his this like I'm going to miss herpes.
There's a cure for this.

but I think it's sad.
How do you think I feel that.

Come on.

sir.
Ah.

It was a stressful one.
we're done now.

000 ounces of gold.
Okay.

Narrator:

-All right.

Is that pan going to be big enough?
I got another one.
12 days ago.
that's sweet.
So this right here is 812 ounces from Indian River.
So that's a hell of a lot of gold.
2563
So that combined is 3375.
Narrator:

You can already feel the table just starting to lean that way.
Don't say that.

Narrator:

So we'll do Sluicifer first.
Filled right to the top.
Filled to the brim.
What do we have in it.
Wow.
That's insane man.
Lookit that.
496
So Sluicifer definitely delivered.
000 ounces and we still aren't there.
Without Big Red's final cleanup.
We need over 129 ounces to hit that.
So Rick.
bud.
Oh boy.
That's a big jar.
No way!
Woooo.
Nice one.

That's 440 ounces.
(laughing)
Ow.
What's our season total?
You ready for this one?
How about 4311 ounces. over a million more than last year.
Whoo.
You guys did a good fuckin' job this year.
I'm damn proud of all of you guys.
you know.
is thanks to you.
Okay man.

My grandpa's funeral was this spring and a very good friend of mine gave me this very nice bottle of whiskey
So we're all gonna have a toast for my grandpa.
None of this would be happening without my grandpa.
it's been a bit of a weird season without him.
He definitely was a big part of what we do.
Salut.

To grandpa John!

We've got some good memories.
we wanted 5000 ounces worth.
We're nowhere near that.
So what if we don't get to a thousand.
Narrator:

But to send his guys home with the money he owes them for the season 000 ounces of gold and last time he checked he was 90 ounces short.
Alright boys.

we had 910.

Well.
Fairplay didn't live up to the deal.

We only got 57.02 ounces.
man.

-What!

buddy.
So what's our total?
1100.77.
Yeah.
guys.
guys.
When we left Oregon we had 200 ounces.
200 ounces.
In a month and a half guys.

000 but I tell you what.

And I know that there's still hurts and hard feelings.
We can get through those problems.
you want to get the guys the gold?
I'll pass them around.
Todd promised everybody a good cut of the gold.
That is nice.
you guys.
Gold for the winter.
Want to say a quick prayer Dad and end the season?
Our heavenly father we thank you for the opportunity that you gave to us.
Lord we ask that you just bring us all together next year.
We can only do that if you're with us.
amen.
Amen.
{\fnLucida Calligraphy}{\cH0ffff0} Subs by JackT
Let's pack up and go home.
I love you guys.
Just want to say I don't know what the future holds for us but I wish you the best of everything.
-Likewise Dave

You've got a great family.

Dave.

absolutely.

There was a full blown panic right there.

Everything I have is gone.
That may be the dumbest thing I ever do.
I don't really care what the family thought about it.
Bit off way more than he could chew.
You have to have this piece of paper and without it you're not doing anything.
Dave and him do not get along.
I don't know why it got so violent.
They were like wanting to like kill each other.
