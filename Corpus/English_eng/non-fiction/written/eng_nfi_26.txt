So in closing, earning a rockterate in rock studies from the Equestrian Institute of Rockology is no easy feat.

[music stops]
Uh, each of...

Go Maud!

Fillies and Gentlecolts...
And is that Magnesium-rich Basalt?
It is my honor to present our vale-rock-torian, Maud Pie.
Excuse me. "Doctor Pie."
Doctor Pie!

Rock-ter Pie?

You're to moving Ponyville.
and I'll make us fuzzy slippers that say... friends forever.
although I probably can't fit all those words on a slipper but we don't have to decide right now because we'll be together all the time since when it comes to Ponyville, THE DOCTOR IS IN!
Slow down, Pinkie Pie.
You're moving to Ponyville!
I'm not definitely moving to Ponyville.
Of course you are, silly.

"There's nothing left to study back home on the rock farm, so I might move to Ponyville."
[POP]
I'm also considering Ghastly Gorge.
Hahahahaha classic Maud sense of humor.

I do, but that wasn't a joke.
GHASTLY GORGE?

There, or Ponyville.
But Ponyville is so "eeeee!"
And Ghastly Gorge is so... "Urghhh."
It's a rock-based decision.
But what about B.S.F.F.'s?
That's why I'm giving Ponyville a chance.
So all I have to do is prove Ponyville has better rocks than Ghastly Gorge?

We'll drop your stuff off at my place and then hold onto your world cause it's about.

OK.
Ghastly Gorge may have "Rocks,"
but our Gem Cave ROCKS!
♪♪ Harp flourishes plays ... ♪♪
Ahhhhh?

And look, you never know who you'll see!
Maud, darling, it's lovely to see you again.
Congratulations on your rockterate.
What are you doing now?
Talking to you.
Ah, right. [laughter]
Well, if your trained eye happens to see a chartreuse gem,
I'm desperate to find one.
I found one.
Oh, you're an absolute darling!
This will surely make my gown stand out at Countess Coloratura's album release party.
Do you know how rare this is?
Just another day in Ponyville!
That's actually a really common gem.
Huh?
[clatter]
These are all really common gems.
They are?

I mean, come on!

That's why I didn't bring you here to impress you.
I wanted to make sure you had a chance to... say hello to your ol' pal...

Tell me about Spike
Way to go, Maud; cross that off the to-do list,
Now let's get moving cause I'm about to show you something that'll make you yell: "ALL RIGHT!"
All right.
See?

Ta-da!

Whaaaat?

I think I just blew your mind.
A lot of structures are made from rocks, Pinkie.
They're a very stable building material.
But this place grew out of nowhere after a magical key-filled gem followed a rainbow
I mean HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ROCKS LIKE THIS?
Yes.
NO YOU HAVEN'T!
We literally just saw hundreds of them in the gem cave.
But... but...

Those are sting-bush seed pods.
So they are.

LOOK AT THAT ROCK!
It's even got four smaller rocks around it like legs!
That's a tortoise.
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON, TANK!

WAIT A MINUTE!

It's a rock shaped like Lyra Heartstrings!
TOTAL ROCK!
[snarl]
I guess you won't be moving to Ponyville after all.
Those rocks at Ghastly Gorge don't know how lucky they are to have you.
Actually, rocks aren't the only reason
I'm considering Ponyville.
You said it's a rock-based decision.
I'm obviously passionate about exotic rocks.
But I've always studied them... alone.
I could handle some less exciting rocks if it meant I'd have somepony to talk to besides Boulder.
Are you saying you want...

I wouldn't mind one.
[gasp]!

What are you looking for in a friend?
A numerical importance rating between one and seven, seven being essential and one being "mehhhhhh?"
It isn't hard to meet somepony I like.
It's finding somepony who gets me.
I get you.
You're my sister.

Maud.

You never know when the lightning of friendship will strike!

♪♪ Mounting tension music... ♪♪
You know I really thought somepony was going to come barrelling through that... [grunt] [clatter]
My fault... totally my fault.

I should have been watching where I was going.
You look really familiar...

Yes.
I knew it...!
WHAT?

Don't tell me, ummmmmmmmm...
Yeah, see I was really hoping you'd tell me while I pretended to remember.
How is this POSSIBLE?

I travelled Equestria for my rockterate dissertation...
Psst!

Yes.
Have you ever come across some kind of super-powerful stone that can store the cutie-mark magic of, I don't know, an entire village?
Yup.

♪♪
♪♪ [laughter] Hey, I got an idea!
Let's not tell anypony that part where you maybe for sure accidentally helped Starlight enslave a town.

Tell.

It's not like she's enslaved anypony lately.
[uncomfortable laugh]
Well, great seeing you again.

Offer to help.
What?
OFFER TO HELP!
You want to help?
Do I?
Of course you do!

OK.
Oh!

♪♪
Rocks take on different properties when interacting with magic.
With the right stone, you could rule all of Equestria if you wanted to.
You're messing with me.
Am I?
[laughter]
So, other than rocks, what else are you into?
Minerals, plate tectonics, oh and stand-up comedy of course.
I like kites.
Kites are cool.
Ah!
The trick with an SLK is not to make the spars too heavy, but if they're too light you got no ballast and then good luck tacking against the ALI.
I really like kites.
They're starting to grow on me.
Pizza delivery!
Oh!

WHOA what a coincidence, cause I was just, you know, delivering this pizza to, um... you!
So how's it going?
Just hangin' out...
Hey, you could use this time to bond
For example: do you "feel" like you're becoming friends?
Um.

Ah!

I feel like I love that you two are becoming best friends!
I mean your friendship could be the friendship that makes Maud move to Ponyville!
No pressure, Starlight!
Hello?

Sorry about my sister.

Oh, I know.

Why do you find rocks so fascinating?
Each one has a different story to tell.

This tells me he's over two thousand years old.
You don't look a day over six hundred.
Wow.

Because I can shred on guitar like nopony else.
[laughter]
Another reason I like rocks... they don't exclude you if you're... different than other ponies.
They're beautiful and strong, but they don't judge you or make you feel "less than"
in any way.

[knock knock]
It's hollow?
It's granite.

[crashing]
♪♪
Wow.

No.

There you are!

Your first time discovering an underground cavern!
I can't wait till you're old and eating pistachios together telling your grandfoals about this.
Oh, no!

I GOT AN IDEA!
Whoaaaa!

And now I'm falling down!
[explosion]
Oho ho, no!
My accidental clumsiness has trapped us here, where you'll be forced to bond until we're rescued.
Oh, we don't have to wait for that!
There's got to be a spell that...
Get us out of here, boy!
[cracking] [clattering]
♪♪
Boulder!

No, that was sandstone.
More sand than stone, apparently.
I'm thinking you wear these around your necks at all times so I don't lose you again, you sillies!
That way I can track your progress as friends!
Ooh and tomorrow we could have a FRIENDSHIP BRUNCH!
What's your favorite kind of omelette-cupcake?
Mine's jalapeño-red velvet!
Uhhhh....
Yeah, um...

You'll change your minds when you smell the yummy food.
Come on!
"Oops."
Tomorrow's brunch is gonna be the scrunchiest, brunchiest munchiest brunch ever!
Yeah.

I couldn't get data points on your friendship probabilities:
were you making Starlight smile?
How was Starlight's smile to frown ratio?
Anything over five to one is GREAT!
Oh, and how many times did YOU smile like this?
Zero times.
Oh, Maud, don't be so hard on yourself.
You've got the best friendship maker in Ponyville on the case.

Speaking of which, your bell fell off, silly!
Pinkie Pie, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but...
But...?
Aah.

Don't worry, Maud.

And then I have amazing bonding activities planned for the next seventeen days!
You and Starlight will be besties in no time!
Goodnight!
[kiss] [clap clap] [snoring] [birds chirping]
Friendship brunch!
Thank you for trying so hard to help me make friends.
But my decision has to be rock-based.
And Ghastly Gorge has such great rocks,
I won't even have time for friends.

Sorry it didn't work out.

Maud, wait!
♪♪
Maud!
Maud.
STARLIGHT, WAKE UP!
Kites!

Huh?

If this is about brunch, I uhh... you know what?
Jalapeno red velvet omelettes sound gross;

Maud left in the middle of the night!
Oh, I guess Ghastly Gorge really does have the best rocks.
[sniffing]
Why couldn't you two just be friends?
Pinkie Pie...

You do?
Yeah, she's weird.
Hey!
No, in a good way.
She sees the world in a totally different way than anypony I've ever met.
She accepts me for who I am.
She taught me that a rock is never just a rock and she can make anything funny!
And we never had to say it but... we got each other.
You really were becoming friends?
I think so, but you kinda, sorta... got in the way.
[gasp]
You're right.

"You ruined everything all the time?"
Ngh... that's worse.

It only proved I'm better off all by myself, like I always have been.
DON'T SAY THAT!

But I didn't even know my own sister.
I forced you to do things my way, but my way isn't your way.

No, this way.

OH MAUD, I LOVE YOU BIGGER THAN ALL EQUESTRIA!
And you melt my heart more easily than sodium-rich plagioclase feldspar.
