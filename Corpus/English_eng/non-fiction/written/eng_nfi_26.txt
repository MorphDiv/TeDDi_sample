Compliments of the gentleman.
Sorry, someone beat you to it.
Officially on the dating sidelines, aren't i?
I Miss all the excitement, romance.
When will he move out of my place and get a job?
Davis' hitting on 2 girls over there.
If you've never been to slaughterhouse, it's the closest you'll get.
This is not going well.
Notice the "don't leave me alone with him" handhold.
Now they're planning exit strategy, meaning we're seconds away from... gone.
Here it comes, the well-thought- out excuse as to why they didn't bite.
They're beach volleyball players.
Can I give you a piece of advice?
Pardon me, can I buy you a drink?
I'm good to go.
Group of three it is.
Do you need any dating tips?
Does it look like I need any dating tips?
I don't know, we never dated.
We went straight from, "hey, baby," to "hey, baby!"
Look, Davis isn't failing yet.
So, you're taken.
You're sober.
Hi, I'm Davis.
I have some amazing... unbelievable news that is going to blow you away.
"You've been invited to take the "how well do you know Abby?" Quiz."
Kill me now.
I'm going to send her a virtual cheeseburger.
Thanks to your advice, I got hot girl's number, and we're going out.
Feels good to score a hot chick.
I know, doesn't it?
I spent that summer in sweden, remember?
I should facebook that girl.
I don't know about advising him.
This is good, 'cause now that I can't go out anymore,
I've waded through the murky waters of Davis' love life.
Swimmin' along, can't see an inch in front of you, and all the sudden, drunk chick with a bat is banging on the door at 3:00 in the morning.
Do we want have a relationship with her, or are we just looking to introduce our genitals to each other?
"Just get laid, casual sex, never see each other again" thing,
Okay, so our goal is to get this girl back to your apartment and score.
This chick is really out of my league.
She's the kind that only sleeps with guys who have doors on their bathrooms.
You know, fancy guys.
I'll get my rubber gloves, a garbage bag and some bleach.
I know she's hot, do you really think I've to knock her out, and stuff her in a garbage bag to get her back to my apartment?
'cause that is pretty dark, but, I mean, you're the boss, so...
I was talking about getting supplies together so that you could clean your apartment.
I know that.
Obviously, I was kidding just now.
Murky, murky waters.
Who am I kidding?
Chance of me getting her back here in 1st place are slim.
This girl is like way out of my league.
We're getting her back here, and we're going to have sex with her.
You know, I went out with this guy Gary, and I was way out of his league.
In fact, he's probably still talking about me.
I was able to look past his flaws, which is something you're going to need her to do.
The reason I could do that is 'cause he told me this really touching story about how his mom put him on the wrong train when he was eight and he had to walk 34 blocks all the way home and how traumatized he was.
I just wanted to go back in time and give that little boy a hug,
But Instead I took a grown man home and gave him the best night of his life.
We feel good about ourselves, don't we?
The point is, it worked.
I put money on the fact that you have some upsetting stories.
I'm going to put on some extra gloves and get to work on your bedroom.
If her advice works, we could be comparing notes tomorrow night.
I take notes.
Yes, but if you're hot enough, it doesn't matter.
the two of you were cool with dating other people.
Yeah, who's going to date her?
She's got stuff popping out all over the place.
I want to be a good guy about this, so I'm going to do it behind her back.
You're a class act, Zack.
I can't believe I'm about to tell you this, but  when I was 13 years old,
I was actually allergic to french kissing.
I was playing this game of spin-the-bottle at camp, and it was my turn and it landed on Patty Elkins...
This was the girl of my dreams, okay?
So, I crawled over toward her and I kissed her.
With tongue, naturally.
And then my face started to tingle a lot.
I thought it was love, but it was really a severe allergic reaction to the eight peanut butter cups patty shotgunned moments before.
My face swelled up to the size of a pumpkin.
For the rest of camp, I was known as "pumpkinhead, boy allergic to girls."
After my parent's divorce,
I started faking a limp and walking with a cane.
I call it, "my big move."
What do you call that move?
I call it "prelude to unhooking your bra."
What do you think?
Hi, mom.
No, I'm on a date.
He's a good kisser.
Here, talk to my mom.
I have a date.
You know, since you and I broke up I'm not going to lie...
I've been skewing kind of young.
My new formula is my age, divided by two.
Minus three.
I have a little somethin' going on myself.
Hey, what's going on?
We are so about to get laid.
Both of our parents got divorced, and... both of us coped by maybe setting a few dumpster fires here and there.
I think I really like her, I think I might wanna see her again.
Then you can't have sex with her.
Relationships are all about withholding sex.
I gotta go.
Is everything allright?
I've to get up early for work tomorrow.
Poor baby.
I'm saving myself for marriage.
I slept with her.
Why didn't you hang up the phone?
Why didn't you hang up the phone?
It was a slow night.
Talking about Davis having sex?
Yes, but we're trying to turn him into relationship material.
But I'm irresistible to her.
And I can't turn it off 'cause I don't know how I turned it on.
Show your stomach mouth.
I am pained and sure i'm going to regret this, but what is stomach mouth?
I am stomach mouth!
Okay, we're in a restaurant.
The next time you see her, if you want a relationship, you have to find a way to make it about more than just sex.
Make it about more than just sex?
I'm gonna be tapping into parts of my brain I didn't know I had.
So...
I had a lovely conversation with a nice young lady named Sasha.
She showed up to the apartment?
You must be Billie!
Can I just say I love your movie reviews?
I do not see a film unless you give it at least three stars.
You are such a nice person.
Who are you?
Zack and I went out the other night on a date.
Well.
I'm Billie, his...
I don't know what he calls me.
Zack told me all about you, and... how you're so awesome and how you're so pregnant.
And I know this doesn't sound like a compliment, but I did not expect you to be this gorgeous.
I thought you were going to be the UPS guy delivering my winter slippers.
I think I have.
Tree hill we went out once!
I had a feeling that girl was Amy Winehouse bat-ass crazy.
So...
Sounds to me like you gave her the distinct impression that you were into her.
I don't want to seem like a bad guy, so I'm not going to call her again.
All right, maybe she's just quirky.
Okay, we're in a restaurant.
Will you pass the ketchup, please?
That sounds like something a friend would do.
But having been de-friended by you last night on Facebook,
I say get your own damn ketchup.
You are driving me crazy with your, your updates and your pokes and you're planting a virtual tree in my name?
Why would you do that?
Why do you need my help with it?
Just plant your own fake tree and leave me alone!
I know that you think the only reason we're friends
I don't think we're friends.
How's it going with Miss teen USA?
The sex is great, but climbing into the loft bed in her college dorm room is killing my back.
And I think I might really be getting sick.
I went to the newspaper to ask you to lunch but you weren't there.
I smell crazy.
I'm James.
Sasha, this is a little...
Impetuous, I know, but I feel a connection between us.
Sort of like a friend, sister, soul mate kind of thing.
Hi, mom, I'm having lunch with Billie.
Nice to meet you, too, Mary.
That's so sweet, but i...
I already have a lamaze partner.
She's got a lot of good qualities.
She showed up at the office, when I wasn't there, she tracked me down at lunch and has texting me ever since.
No, it got rained out, so she just went and got yogurt.
Another text!
"Tell Zack i'm thinking about him."
"Tell Billie I'm thinking about her."
Sweet mother of god.
I actually think it would be better if we went out on an actual date.
If we hustle right now, we can catch a noon screening of Schindler's list.
But I want to stay here with you.
But I think we should get some coffee and talk.
I'm really horny.
But I want to see Schindler's list.
Sasha, look... how do I put this?
Some foods just don't go together.
Pickles and melon, whipped cream and eggplant, or...
Radishes and yogurt,
God, I've heard this exact speech so many times.
You're breaking up with me.
Is your zipper glued shut?
Yes, yes, it is.
Look, Davis, that's really sweet, but I'm just not interested in anything more than a physical relationship with you.
Why?
Or because I have no money or any desire to make money?
Because I have no goals or dreams, or desire to have any goals or dreams?
You're right, I'm really not relationship material.
Screw it, get a steak knife and cut me out of these pants right now.
You know what?
Remember this?
A hot chick wanted to have sex with me, and because of you, I blew it!
You're the one who wanted to have a relationship, I was happy to bang her.
Zack and I are over!
How many more lives are you going to destroy?
I held it together in the bar, but I just kept thinking,
I need to talk to my best friend.
But she wasn't home, so you came here?
You have such a great sense of humor.
And I know you will say the exact right thing to make me feel better.
There.
There.
You are so wise.
At least I didn't make a scene when he dumped me.
He has no idea he is tearing me up inside.
I think he might have an idea.
How do I put this?
Some foods just don't go together.
That was the strangest breakup I have ever had.
I can't believe how upset she was when you broke up with her.
I'm sure there's a pregnant couple out there with an unwieldy age difference that's right for her, but it is not us.
What a stupid idea, "vicarious dating."
Without the sex, dating is just letting people annoy you for no reason.
I should be more careful who I bring into this house.
So, basically, I'm four times my normal size, my hormones are so out of control,
I sometimes laugh, cry and want to kill someone in the same moment, and the big change in your life is that you have to pick up quality girls?
I know, right?
Well, why don't you go get yourself a quality girl?
I'm going to stay here and watch some quality tv.
Can I watch it with you?
You're a quality girl.
Want to rub a quality girl's feet?
Why don't you just rub my feet, and I'll let you keep living here?
Yeah, that's good.
I was writing up a story last night on a triple homicide, and it wasn't one of those funny triple homicides.
I just wanted to tell you that.
Abby likes this.
God help me.
