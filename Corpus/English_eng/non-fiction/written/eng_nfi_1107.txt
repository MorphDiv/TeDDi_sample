Haven't seen you around here.
How 'bout one for your friend?
None for him.
But I will have another.
All right.
Where are you coming from?
What, is it like top secret or something?
Yeah.
More beers!
Hold your horses!
So, who's the bunny for?
My daughter.
Oh, she's gonna love it.
I hope so.

Where's she at now?
Grandmother's.

What are you doing here?

Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.
Oh... does your wife know you're here?
No.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Jesus Christ, Stupid!

I said I was coming!

God damn it!
OK, look, you know, um, if you don't have a place to stay tonight,
I have room at my house.
You know, just, just think about it.
-OK, here's your beers.

-Come here now.

-Let go.

Just give me a little kiss.

-Ahh,

Come on, give me a little sugar.
What are you looking at?
Okay, Chopper, stop.
Come on, shh, just give me a little kiss.
-Give me a fucking kiss!

-Let go of me.

No!

Let go!
Hey, buddy, why don't you take it easy?
You got something to say?
I'm talking to you asshole.
Relax.
Relax.
Fuck... you.
911?
I have an emergency.
Hey, asshole!
Goddamn it, man.
Don't do this.
Oh, man, I wanna do this.
Ah!
Rise and shine, asshole.
Here you go, freak.
Hey, can I get a knife?
Shut up, weirdo!
Here's your food, traitor.
Fuck you.
Come on, boys!

Hey.
Me?
Where am I?
We don't know where we are.
We all just woke up here one day.
But we're all friends.
Welcome... friend.
Don't listen to him.
Please, I'm trying to talk to the new guy.
He's a fucking liar!
OK, look, if you're gonna keep interrupting--

Shut the fuck up before I fucking kill you!
Stop it!
I'm trying to read.
Well, I might as well introduce you to everyone.
The loud one is Hudson.
He can be a little rude sometimes.
Former Army Ranger.
Started a little side business smuggling opium on his last tour in Afghanistan.
One of his farmers was late to pay, and well, let's just say he doesn't worry about next year's harvest.
He's a fucking liar.

That's about it for the talkative ones.
Next to me, is Diego.
Navy SEAL, sniper.

Over 200 confirmed kills.
He's a goddamn traitor.
All that killing went to his head.
When a CO denied his request to release from duty, he shot him.
And down there... is Simms.
And we don't really know much about him.
Maybe he'll tell us now that you're here.
Hey, Simms, the new guy is here and wants to know what you did.
Leave me alone!
He'll come around.
And down there, we don't really know who's in there.
Yeah, one time, these two guards went in, they came out on stretchers.
And my name is Taylor.
I'm so happy you're here.
What's your name, friend?
Jake.
Everyone, meet Jake.
Jake, meet everyone.
Wanna tell our new friend, Jake, what you did?
Jake just got here.

He's a genuine psychopath.
That's not true.
Government took him away from his family when he was a little baby.
Grew up in some secret assassin program.
No, no, no, my childhood was perfectly normal.
He's fucked up in the head, man, I'm telling you.
He likes to cut people up.
Keep little pieces of them for souvenirs.
Liar!

It's much deeper than that.
Government turned a blind eye, 'til he started picking his own targets.
OK!

That's not true.
I mean it's not exactly true.
So this is a military prison.
It's a black site prison for special cases.
People too dangerous with too many secrets.
People the Department of Defense doesn't want the public to know about.
Is that true?
No one knows we're here.
We don't even know where we are.
So at the facility where they raised me,
I wasn't allowed to have any friends.
Well, I did have one friend, his name was Jeremy, but he wasn't real.
I mean he was real, but no one else could see him.
We weren't allowed to have pets either.
-I mean I did have this one--

Well, he was a bug.
Shut up.
What was that?
Gunfire.
Listen up!
Six, this is Bravo, there's something you need to see.
Six is on his way.
Why didn't we know about this?
I don't know, sir.
Are you responsible for the condition of these men?
Answer me!
These men are warriors!
How dare you treat them without dignity.
Stupid twat!

How dare you treat these men without dignity and respect!
Apologies, gentlemen.
Our intel failed to inform us that there was a prison here.
My current mission doesn't concern you, or else I'd invite you to come play with us 'cause we could surely use men of your caliber.
Colonel Irving.
Got yourself in a bit of a jam, mate?
Mm.

What are they calling you now?
Jake.
That's so American.
Six, this is Charlie;

Six is on his way.
Well, it was good seeing you.
Don't go anywhere, will you, gentlemen?
Should be a good show.
How do you know that guy?
Former British SAS turned contractor.
Damn it.
Met him in Islamabad.
What was he doing there?
Recruiting.
Got it.
Got it.
Taylor.
Huh.
Taylor.
Yeah, Jake?
Give us the keys, man.
Unlock the fucking door, Taylor.
Come on, let us out.
I swear to God, if you don't unlock this door right fucking now.
Open the doors.

Come on!

Beg.
Fuck you!
Unlock the fucking door!
Come on!

Look, I'm begging you.

OK.
I was gonna do it anyway.
But I'm keeping this.
Fuck.
We're starting the cut now.
Roger that.
What do you want?
I'm busy.

Colonel Irving reports he's cutting the door, sir.
Good, good... very good.
-It's beautiful.

So what do we do now?
He didn't smoke us when he had the chance-- I say we make a break for it.
And why should we listen to you?
Cause I didn't frag a guy in my own unit.
-Fuck you!

I'll kill you mother--
Stop, stop, listen, listen,
I know that man out there;
I've seen the aftermath of what he's capable of.
If we wanna have any chance of surviving this, we need to get our heads on straight and start working together.
OK?
I say we do some recon and we figure a way outta here.
Unless you got any better ideas?

No?

Fuck that.

We don't know what's in there.
You're all a bunch of degenerate maniacs.
For all we know, the guy in there is way worse than whatever the hell is out there.
Well, we don't let him out, he dies.
So?
What took you so long?
Wait a minute.
Ahhh-ha-ha!
Ooh!
I do this thing where I go around
And say everyone's story and name, but I don't think we have time for that right now.

Look.
Looks like they've taken over the whole goddamn base.
No cell service.
Landlines are dead.
All right,
I'm gonna check out the roof.
I'm going, too.
That's our way out.
Hey, look.
Come on.
All right, so, there is an open guard post north of here.
And Irving seems to be focused on a building 200 meters south.
So we should be clear.
-All right, let's move out.

What are they doing at that building 200 meters south?
Breaking into it.

200 meters due south--
Get to the point.
That's the control building for a long range drone program.
We have long range drones?
Not officially.
That's why the program is here.

How do you know this?
I used to work there.
I was a pilot.
Look, I wanted to be a regular pilot, but...
So I became a drone pilot.
There is a classified long range drone program here.
Why should we trust you?

I worked for a terrorist hit squadron, OK?
They ordered me to bomb a children's birthday party a terrorist was attending.
I refused the order, so they decided to make an example out of me.
Yes.

I knew I'd get your story eventually.
One of those drones is fitted with a 50 megaton nuclear bomb.
It's in the air 24/7.
The control of that drone is in that building.
So they're about to have control of a nuclear bomb.
That's what I'm saying.
Wait, but the power's out.
All critical systems have backup generators.
Oh, fuck this.

Why aren't they fighting these guys?
They're decommissioning the base.
It's running on a skeleton crew.
All right, but they have to have some sort of backup plan.
There is a quick response force.
Well great!

But we are in the middle of nowhere.
They're at least two hours away.
Look, if we can pull this off,
I guarantee every one of us will get a pardon.
I'm in.
I'll help.
When this is over, I'm going back here.
What?
Some of us deserve to be here for what we did.
You're loco, Ese.
For a full pardon, you're goddamn right I'm in.
Can I be in?
I'm in.

What about you?
My daughter is waiting for me.
We get through this, you won't have to raise her like a fugitive.

OK, what do we do now?

We need to move faster.
We're going as fast as we can, sir.
Well, I want it to go even faster, is that understood?
Yes, sir.
Now get to work.
All right, if we switch to an alt frequency, we can communicate.
Check, check, check, check.
Great.

There's a button at the command center.
It allows another base to take control of the drones.
It's just a button?
They needed a physical switch to make it hacker proof.
If we push that button, a pilot at another base can assume control of the drones.
OK, so all we gotta do is push a button.
We also have to push one on the drone control panel, and we have to push it within 30 seconds of each other.
Are you kidding me?
All right, so, we gotta fight our way into the drone control building while at the same time, fighting our way into the command center building on the other side of the base.
Push the two buttons simultaneously to prevent nuclear holocaust.
Yes.
People say I'm crazy;
I'm not, by the way.
But this is crazy.
No, no, no, this is bullshit.
I said I was gonna help, but this is turning into a suicide mission.
You know what, we all got into this at some point because we wanted to be a part of something bigger than ourselves.
We wanted to make a difference.
This is not about some pardon.
If we don't do this, what kind of father would I be knowing that I coulda done something to stop this?
I know we've all been in bad spots before.
But this is what they trained us for.
