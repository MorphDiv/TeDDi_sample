(Sam grunting)
(bell dings)
Whoo!
That circuit is no joke.
Looked like you were having uncontrollable muscle spasms.
(Sam chuckles)
Can't bring me down, G.
Endorphins are flowing, I feel great.
Want to give it a go?
No, I've decided to cut back on my bean bag training.

Cut your workout time in half.
No, no, no.
Flexibility and mobility, that's the strength and cardio of 2017.
(chuckles) Where'd you hear that?
(grunts)
What do you mean where did I hear that?
What makes you think I didn't come up with that original thought?

All right,
I heard it in a podcast Anna was listening to.
You know, learning something new from experts, never a bad thing.
Okay, see, you said experts.
Therein lies the rub, there are no experts on these podcasts.
No degrees or qualifications are needed.
All you have to have is a computer, a microphone, and some very strong opinions.
I'm sure they do their research before each podcast.
No, no research.
How do you know?

'Cause every sentence begins with
"You know, I read somewhere that..."
Get back to stretching.

Mm.
Hey.
Good morning.
Have you been up for a long time?
(inhales sharply)
Kind of.
Well, baby, I'm so sorry you can't sleep.
And if there's anything I can do...
I actually slept really well last night.
Really?

That's incredible.
It's been a while since I've slept that well.
I feel really good.
Well, that's awesome and we should celebrate.
- You know how we should celebrate, though?

Deeks' frittatas, Deeks' famous frittatas.
And then we should go paddle boarding down in the marina.
Deeks?
I know the guy that's renting all the new boards, he's got the Laird ones now, so...

Yeah?

Oh, dear God, yes.
Almighty.
What's happening?
Hi.

I just wanted to say thank you.
Thank you for what?
For everything.
Ah.
You're the strong one, I was just along for the ride.
Shh.
Baby, you know how much I want to do this, are you sure you're ready?
Yeah.
(phone chimes)
Don't.

DEEKS:

Baby, don't get that, put that down, put that-- (groans)
No, no, see that's probably just your stock quote being updated.
Don't.

Yeah, we got to go.

Yeah, we do, we got to go.

I think we should just talk about this, (groans) but by talk about this, I mean make-- oh, God.
(inhales)
If you just gave me, like, four minutes.
All right, two and a half.
Kens?
What do we have?
(sighs)
Last night, civilian engineer Sheldon Rhodes was killed in an explosion in his RV.
ERIC:

He ran an elite group of engineers tasked with the development of critical systems for the Navy's new Zumwalt class destroyer.
Zumwalt class?
Guided missile destroyers.
Stealth ships.
Due to the sensitive nature of that project,
SECNAV needs to know if the plans for the ship have been compromised in any way.
Do we know what caused the explosion?
Mm, C.S.U. hasn't started processing yet.
They're waiting on the coroner and fire to finish.
Now, it's unclear if a bomb was used.
Were there any witnesses?
A few.
They described a "sudden and massive" explosion.
NELL:

She'd like for you to investigate the wreckage;
see if this is just some accident, or if Rhodes was intentionally targeted.
Copy that.
(seagulls squawking)
CALLEN:

They said we can look, but we can't enter the RV or touch anything.
Got it.

Well, this definitely wasn't caused by a fuel fire.
No.
They hard-wired an explosive device into the RV's electrical system.
They probably used a timer.
Open the door, trigger one of the electrical systems, countdown begins.
Soft detonator.
Yo.

SAM:

So who uses soft ones?
It's really only used on film and TV sets.
I guess that makes sense.
Hard one would have shrapnel, be a little dangerous on the set.
All right.
You know anybody that sells this type?
No, I don't.
But I know someone who does.
Good.
This was a big bang.
And they used det cord, a lot of it.
Causes a massive concussive explosion.
Yeah, whoever did it wasn't taking any chances.
They wanted to make sure Rhodes was dead.
WOMAN:

I'm sure you understand, but we've never allowed members of the media into the secured engineering pods.
DEEKS:

Of course, we were forwarded your security clearances.
I just meant we've never allowed outsiders in here.
Sheldon Rhodes was working on a classified Navy project and we're here investigating that on behalf of NCIS and the secretary of the Navy, which means, if anybody's an outsider, it's...
It's certainly not you,
Belinda Fujita, VP of Public Relations, (giggles) because you have been, you've been wonderful.
You are so sweet.
Yeah, no, if by sweet, you mean professional, then yeah.
BELINDA:

I would love to know more about exactly what it is that NCIS does.
Maybe we could grab a pitaya bowl one day and you could fill me in.
Wow.

I'm actually more of an açai bowl guy, myself.
(giggles)
Well, trying new things can really, uh, change your life.
Oh...
This is Sheldon Rhodes' engineering pod.
(electronic beep) Five of his engineers are assembled and ready to speak to you.
Oh, I thought that, uh, seven engineers reported to Mr. Rhodes.
That's correct.

Two of his lead engineers opted to stay home today upon hearing of Sheldon's...
(sobbing quietly)
All right, listen, I know that this is a difficult time,
Yeah.

Yep.

Well, I'm just, um...

I'm just gonna be in here, uh, interviewing the engineers.

You're okay.
We'll just get those... addresses later.

I know you were en route to talk to a contact to speak about the explosives that were used.
Yeah, Lincoln Stern, he's a friend from the Teams.
Well, I think I'm going to send Kensi and Deeks to speak with Mr. Stern.
Why is that?
Because I have something a little more international planned for you two.
Mm.
I hear Bali's nice this time of year.
Yeah.
Kensi and Deeks just found out two of Rhodes' lead engineers never arrived at work today.
We looked into it.
Turns out that this man, Aiden Tinker, just booked a last minute airline ticket.
LAX to Tokyo.
You think Tinker's a spy, and that he's trying to sell the plans to the stealth ship.
I do.
SAM:

Tinker might have killed him.
And now he's headed to Tokyo with the plans.
I want you both on that plane.
When it lands, do not let Tinker out of your sight.
If he's going to Tokyo to sell those plans,
I want to know who's buying.
Got it.
HETTY:

One more thing.
You'll be backstopped as travelling businessmen, but since we have no idea who Aiden Tinker is working with, we can't apply for a diplomatic pouch.
It may alert the wrong people.
So no guns on the plane or on the ground in Tokyo?
It's not an ideal situation.
Guess we should've asked Sam what his friend looks like.
Well, he's a SEAL, and there's only two types of SEALs, so it should be easy to spot him.
- Two types?

Type one, you got a death metal SEAL, which is, like, the beard and the tattoos and everything, and then type two is your squared away, fitness freak, entrepreneur SEAL.
Hey, I was thinking, um, we could take the train up the coast this weekend.
Uh, train... up the coast, yeah, I don't, eh, I don't think that's a great id...
Why not?

What do you think?
Yeah, no, that does, that does sound great,
I just thought maybe, that-- for this weekend, we'd just, we stayed in L.A.
we could, you know, we could stalk the Kogi truck on Twitter, and-- that sounds fun, right?
What is going on with you?

Nothing's up.

Maybe I'm just craving succulent pork tacos, you know?
Yeah, okay.

No, no.

Why do we have to stay in town this weekend?
Because-

Why?
(sighs) Kensi.
Deeks.
Tell me why.

Kat, Mindy, Mandy, Tiffany and Tiffany are coming in town this weekend to surprise you, to celebrate your recovery and to...
And you've ruined the surprise.
No, I mean, I have given up certain details of said surprise, but that was under extreme duress.
The Tiffanys are coming to town!

Oh, and there's our SEAL.
DEEKS:

Death metal, tattoos, beard, boom.
KENSI:

You must be Kensi and Shaggy.
Deeks.
What was that?
Uh, Deeks, my name is Deeks.
That's not what Sam said.
Don't like to contradict Sam.
(Kensi clears her throat)
Speaking of Sam, he said that you may be able to help us out with some explosives information for a case.
Yeah, I'm sure I can help.
What are you offering?
Sorry, what?
Offering?

Doesn't have to be a lot.
Cash, jiu-jitsu gi, surfboard.
Oh, I mean, I thought that you were helping us out because...
No, I always help out Sam.
He saved my life.
Did you ever save my life?
No.
No, I have not.
No, I...

Sometimes I forget the faces of everyone that's saved my life.
Yeah.
But you do believe my time has a value attached to it?
Yeah, no.

You guess.
KENSI:

You're an expert among experts, okay?
Sam has told us that you've executed and designed pyro for the biggest movies in Hollywood.
Believe me.

I like you, Kensi.
(laughs) I might help you out at no cost.
Thank you.

What do you got, Shaggy?
Yeah, Shaggy, what do you got?
Let me...

(airplane flying overhead)
(indistinct chatter)
CALLEN:

We need to be able to cover the whole plane.
Yeah, I get that,
Just don't know why you can't be back in coach.
Thank you.
I need the leg room.
Yeah, don't worry, G. Ha, ha.
Your flexibility and mobility training will come in handy in those tight little seats.
Oh, you were just waiting for that one, weren't you?
Welcome, what seat do you have?
2A.

That's right up front here.

Oh, that is wonderful.
You hear that, G?

Welcome, what seat do you have?
38E.
All the way in the back by the lavatories.
Thanks.

Konichiwa.
(clearing throat)
Keep following the gentleman here.
Uh, can you please keep it moving, sir?
(chuckles) You're liking this, aren't you?
Just keep it moving, G.
Lavatory's a long way back.
38.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Big Ron.
I'm in, uh, wireless communication devices.
That's great.
My friends call me Big Ron because...
You're big.

(both laugh)
Yep.

Yeah.
And I'm loving this.
Yeah.
How lucky am I?
Very lucky.
What's your name?
G.
G?

What kind of name is that?
Well, it's a...

Okay.
May I take your jacket, sir?
Absolutely.
(sighs)
A hot towel?
Thank you.

And once we get airborne, would you like a bowl of fresh fruit?
You know, I would love some fresh fruit.
You're cute.
Maybe I'll bring you two bowls.
Yeah, I like that.
I like that.
Got any fresh fruit in the back, G?
(Big Ron grunts)
Would you like some chicken?
No, I'm, uh,
I'm all set.

Really?
Mm-hmm.

Whenever I'm in L.A., I stop at this place.
(exhales)
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm good.
Thank you for offering.
That does smell really good.
Oh, have a piece.

Uh, how about a drumstick?
One drumstick coming right up.
Oh, thanks.
Mm.
Mm!
There you go.
Thank you.

It's good, huh?

It's really good.

LINCOLN:

DEEKS:

Your time is valuable.
All right, guys.
So, this is the soft detonator used to trigger the explosion.
Yeah.

That's det cord.
DEEKS:

You see that yellow cord with the two black stripes?
Yeah.
It's not a hundred percent, because of all the various suppliers, but for my money, yellow cord with two black stripes comes from PWX Supplies in the Valley.
Wow.

Thank you.

Anytime.
You got off easy with the coffee.
Next time, put a little more thought into my payment.
I'm on it.

Think about it.
All right.

ERIC (over comms):

I see that you are airborne.
You copy?
Yeah.
I hear you.
I knew you'd understand, G.
(laughs)
ERIC:

CALLEN:

What?

We haven't even started in with the beers.
Hey.

Hey, pal.

Sam, I'm gonna pop the door.
Flight attendant's dead.
- Tinker's...

Keep your hands up and back up.
- Look, I am...

- You need to...

Air Marshal Miguel Salazar.
NCIS Special Agent G. Callen, this is Special Agent Sam Hanna.
Eric.
Sending you a photo of an I.D.
I need some verification.

What do you guys think you're doing up here?

If you are who you say you are, we'll know.
ERIC:

Thanks, Eric.
What the hell's going on here?
Whose body is that in there?
We're surveiling a suspect.
He came back to the lavatory, I followed.
I found the flight attendant dead.
Are you saying your suspect is missing on the flight?
Okay.

Aiden Tinker.
I'll need to alert the captain of the situation.
There's one more air marshal aboard who won't reveal themselves.

To protect the cockpit.
Yeah.

Does this go down to the cargo hold?
Yeah.
SAM:

Hold on.
Code is:

Yes, Captain.
I've got a situation to brief you on, but I need to do a headcount first.
Copy.
CAPTAIN JACOBS (over P.A.):

We have a bit of turbulence up ahead.
I'm gonna need everyone to return to their seats and fasten their seat belts.
Thank you.
(chimes)
Easier to search if everyone's in their seat.
I'll stay here, watch the cargo hold door.
NELL:

Why would Tinker want to kill that flight attendant?
Maybe the flight attendant caught him with one of those Samsung phones.
Too soon?
Sorry.

Okay, wait.
What if the flight attendant did catch Tinker doing something he shouldn't have been doing?
If Tinker is flying to Tokyo to sell the stealth ship plans to someone there, why would he do anything to attract attention to himself onboard?
So maybe he's not flying to Tokyo to sell the plans.
Maybe he's selling the plans on the flight.
Or maybe, someone's trying to steal the plans from him on the plane.
SALVADOR ORTEGA:

I've never had anything stolen until now.
And they stole, uh, det cord and soft detonators?
Yeah.
This is where they parked their truck.
And then they drove away from here.
I've given the surveillance footage to the ATF already.
All right, we'll get a copy, thank you.
It's not gonna tell you much except they were men.
They were smart about the camera angles and wearing hoodies.
If you need anything else, I'll be inside.
All right.

- All right, appreciate it.

Well, if Mr. Ortega's cameras didn't catch their faces, maybe somebody else's did.
Yeah, I'm not really seeing any more surveillance cameras anywhere.
DEEKS:

Second floor.
KENSI:

Shall we?
We shall.

This is Cheryl.
She's been briefed by the captain.
Sam Hanna, NCIS.
Special Agent Callen.
Is Thomas in there?
He is.
Oh.

So, he would like to know where to fly his plane.
Can he turn back to L.A. without alerting the other passengers?
CHERYL:

He told me that you would ask me that and he said to tell you that he can fly this thing upside down without alerting the passengers.
Then let's head back to L.A.
CHERYL:

You're on your own for the next two hours.
Um these passengers are my responsibility.
I need you to let me know if they're in danger.
We'll let you know.
Tinker's not on this level.
Let's check the cargo hold.
I wasn't made aware of any diplomatic pouches onboard, so I'm assuming the two of you aren't carrying firearms.
We are not.
SALAZAR:

(scanner beeps)
Were you able to get clean images of the two guys that stole those explosives?
A little more than that.
The image was clear enough to run through facial rec.
So we have IDs?
It's still running, but we were able to scan their faces into Kaleidoscope;

One of them boarded a flight.
Leaving the country?
Yes, same flight as Callen and Sam.
So why can't we just get his name off the ticket?
Mm, that's because he doesn't have a ticket.
So how did he get on the plane?
That's exactly what we're trying to find out.
So, we located his partner in the crowd at the gate.
He's sitting right there on his laptop, across from the woman scanning tickets.
He never gets on the plane.
That's it.
I couldn't figure out how they were able to hack the airline's secured server.

They just went over Wi-Fi and hacked the ticket scanner at the gate.
They must have used tickets from another flight to get past security.
Then they probably issued duplicate seat numbers at the gate.
KENSI:

Wait, what?
He should leave.
He's already got his partner on the flight, why does he keep hacking the ticket scanner?
Can we run through the whole boarding and set the counter?
Yeah.
There are 272 people that boarded that flight.
NELL:

KENSI:

That's why they killed the flight attendant.
They got on the plane, went straight to the back.
Flight attendant asked them to sit down... (sighs) ...that was it.

We have to alert Sam and Callen.
If we can.

Callen, Sam, do you read me?
Callen, Sam?
The Wi-Fi signal probably doesn't reach their comms down there.
Hey, air marshal!
(muffled gunshots firing)
Give me his gun.
Gun.
He's losing a lot of blood.
I'm not gonna be able to hold 'em off for long.
(Salazar panting) SAM:

SALAZAR:

Okay, okay, I got it.

I got you.
G. (Salazar pants, groans)
Just in time.
We got to go.

Yeah, I think he can walk.

(passengers murmuring)
CHERYL:

Okay, hang in there, buddy.
Listen, I need you to take me to the second air marshal.
The one in first class.
I'll go.

Hang in there, buddy.

Salazar, hang-- hang in there.
Eric, we're here.
Okay.

Traffic cams brought me to this street, and then, I lost him.
I've got an ID for him.
His name is Aric Weber.
Let me guess, he's suspected of being a book club leader in Redondo Beach.
Scandalous, but no.

German Naval Special Forces.
According to Interpol, he's working freelance now.
That's beautiful, he probably knows kung fu.
(sighs) We're gonna go look for that Jeep.
ERIC:

This is NCIS Special Agent Callen.
Oh, Air Marshal Vanessa Barley.

He's injured.

My partner's trying to stabilize him in the rear of the aircraft.
We have four known shooters onboard.
Is this is a takeover scenario?
We don't believe it is.
Okay, but I can't leave my post.
I understand that.

Yes?
Yes, Captain?
Four in the cargo hold.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Captain.
(P.A. dings)
CAPTAIN JACOBS:

That was just some cargo in the hold that shifted during the turbulence.
However, we do have a passenger that's experiencing severe air sickness.
So, please keep the aisles clear while we bring him to the front of the plane.

(P.A. dings) BARLEY:

Bring Salazar up there, there's a full trauma kit.
We've secured the access door to the cargo hold.
Captain said if they have tools, they may be able to come up through various floor panels.
No one's getting past me to that cockpit.
Let's do it.
Hey.

(German accent):

One heck of a barbeque you got got going there, huh?
Or maybe a backyard, personal Burning Man?
(laughs) Because of the-- 'cause of the gas.
I need to go.

Come on, man, we're neighbors.

I just bought this new TV, I was wondering if you could give me a hand bringing it inside.
Hey, buddy, did you not hear me?
No, I definitely heard you.

Nice and easy, right now.
Now put your hands up.

Hey, I'm late for class.

- If you see Fed Ex, can you sign for me?

(gasps) What's going on?
Hey!

(screaming) It's okay.
It's okay.

Just breathe, breathe.

Just breathe.

You're okay.

Kens?
Weber's neighbor, Tina, is with LAPD.
We recovered a laptop at the scene.
It's in transit to Eric as we speak.
NELL:

Did Weber's home reveal anything else?
Yeah, that he was definitely here to kill Rhodes.
We found surveillance pictures of Rhodes and his RV, and detailed files on everyone that worked on the stealth ship unit.
Which is why he was about to burn his apartment to the ground.

Well, maybe Weber wanted to kill Rhodes as a show of power.
DEEKS:

It brings Aiden Tinker back in line.
Tell him if he doesn't help them steal the plans, he dies just like Rhodes did.
And if Tinker refuses, they just move on to the next engineer and so on and so forth.
So, if Interpol's right and Weber's a hit man, we got to figure out who hired him.
So, locals are interrogating a baggage handler out of Taoyuan Airport in Taiwan.
It looks like he was paid to stash guns in the cargo hold on a layover two days ago.
All in an honest day's work.

Hey, were you able to find who Weber was working for?
Uh, no.
But I think I know why the shooters on the plane haven't killed Tinker yet, even if they do have his computer with the plans on it.
Why, because they have, like, a deep respect for human life?

That would be ideal, wouldn't it?
Mm-hmm.

I did find a thread on this laptop.
The shooters seem to think that there's a fail-safe that's built into the stealth ship plans.
Like an encrypted data file?

Rhodes and his engineers hid it in the plans to protect against situations just like this.
- Uh-huh.

They'd never be able to replicate any of the new technologies on that stealth ship.

And if no one tried to steal the plans, then Rhodes would just delete the file himself before delivering the project to the navy.
Exactly.

What if Aiden Tinker has already showed them how to remove the encrypted data file?
He'd be worthless.
They'd kill him.
Yeah, but they can't just walk off the plane with the plans on the laptop.
I mean, not with Callen and Sam on their heels.
They could use the Wi-Fi to transmit the plans off the plane.
Or... a sat phone with a VertaSat hotspot placed on a window.
But there's nothing we can do about that.
We need to kill the plane's Wi-Fi.
That's going to turn off Callen and Sam's comms.
Copy that, Eric.
Wi-Fi's going down.
Sat phone hotspot will be the only way they can transmit the plans.
Okay, well, whoever's behind this, they want to un-encrypt that thing in the air, not on the ground.

Get the plans transmitted to them directly from the plane, they have no ties to any of this, even if their hired men get taken down.
(door opens, passengers screaming)
(gunshot)
Sam!
(grunting)
(passengers screaming)
Aah!
You good?
Now I am.
I got Salazar.
(passengers scream)
I'm a federal agent.

(screaming quiets)
From the marshal.
Does Agent Callen need a zip tie for the other man?
No.
Why not?
Oh...

Everything's gonna be okay.
All right?
Yeah.
(passengers exclaiming)
You're going to want to drop that gun.
MAN:

Do it now!
Okay.
I'm setting it down.
All right?
MAN:

(quietly):

You can do it, Cheryl.

(very quietly):

SAM:

All right?
No one has to die here.
I don't see it that way.
If I want a chance of getting off of this plane, people are gonna have to die.
SAM:

A federal agent is worth a lot more than any of these civilians.
(chuckles) I like that you think this is a negotiation.
It's over.

I can kill you and them if I want.
I don't need your permission.
Pick that up.
Put his hands through it.
Pick it up or I put a bullet in your skull!
Tie his hands.
Now.
Hard right, Captain Jacobs!
(passengers screaming)
(grunting)
Aah!
Clear.
Clear.

G.
He said he was transmitting.
Yeah.

Only three down.

G.
G.
Ron, move!
Hands off the keyboard.
Clear.
(breathing shakily)
(passengers applauding, cheering)
So, did, uh, Sam and Callen land yet?
Momentarily.
The laptop that you recovered has yielded some valuable information.
Wonderful.
This is Chief Inspector Sakuraba of the Tokushu Butai--
Japanese counterterrorism unit.
I hear the operation was a success.
SAKURABA:

Based on your Intel, we were able to arrest five Chinese nationals in Tokyo.
They had financed and masterminded a plot to steal the U.S. naval plans.
We detained or killed five mercenaries.
Did they hire anyone else?
We do not know that.
Arigatou gozaimasu, Chief Inspector.
No, thank you, Henrietta-San.
Good-bye.
Konbanwa.
(call beeps off)
You all did exemplary work today.
Now get out of here.
Go have a life.
DEEKS:

you mean to mentally prepare myself for the tornado that is Kat, Mindy, Mandy, Tiffany, and Tiffany.
The Tiffanys are in town!
Oh, God help us all.

Sure will.
Hang in there, Salazar.
Thank you.
Great work today.
Thanks.
I, uh, figured you'd want to get out of that shirt.
Just didn't know how you'd be more comfortable.
Thanks.
I know I'm supposed to be happy now... that we're all safe.
Cheryl, those people are safe because of you.
You were brave, you didn't lose your cool.
I just keep thinking about all of the millions of things that could have gone wrong.
Yeah, but they didn't.
So, what?

Something did happen.
You found out when the stakes are at their highest... you're at your very best.
I like that.
Captain Jacobs.
Truly sorry about your flight attendant.
Thank you.
Thomas was a-a good man.
You know that under no circumstances could I open that cockpit door and come out to help you boys.
We understand.
Although, I knew that you didn't need my help one bit.
I want to thank you for protecting my 268 passengers, and for not damaging my girl too bad in the process.
Yeah, that was some pretty impressive flying there, sir.
Well, when you get to be my age, boys, you both pray for and fear situations like this.
You know, men like us, we are not designed to grow old.
We don't know how to do it... and we sure as hell can't do it gracefully.
Hooyah.
Thanks again.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And thank you.
CALLEN:

CHERYL:

I'm-a go change out of these clothes, grab our weapons, then you're gonna buy me a beer.
(both chuckle)
HETTY:

Hetty, I didn't think you'd still be here.
Well, after the day you two have had,
I wanted to offer you something from my private reserve.
I heard you had a stash of Pappy Van Winkle.
I will neither confirm nor deny.
Yeah, well, whatever it is, I'm in.
HETTY:

Sherry Cask, 2013.
Would you do the honors, Mr. Callen?
Yeah.

That's got to be about three stacks worth of whiskey.
More like four stacks, I think, Mr. Hanna, but I didn't pay for it.
It was a gift.
(Hetty laughs)
Here you go.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Callen.

Cheers.
Cheers.

(laughs)
Oh.
Oh, the past 12 months for our family here... they've just plain sucked.
I... there's no better way to say that.
(sighs) (Hetty sighs)
Moments that I felt were the darkest, they were eclipsed by complete blackness.
But today... days like today, what you did on the plane, what the rest of our team did on the ground, when our purpose is clear... these are the good days.
We will write the pages of this year's book together.
And let's make it one hell of a story.
Hear, hear.

SAM:

Cheers again.
(laughs)
