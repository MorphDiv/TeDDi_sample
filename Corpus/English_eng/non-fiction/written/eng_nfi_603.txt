So, now on to final business.
Yeah, the book that Ethan Turner and I have been working on is ready for prime time.
I am so sorry to interrupt.
Good morning, Patel.
I love your beret.
They are bidding mid-seven figures for Patty Ho's Wolf Trials series!
Oh, God, that's awesome!
That's my book, Wolf Trials.
The book Ethan Turner and I were working on, Wolf Trials.
What are you talking about?
Are you joking?
Max, Wolf Trials has been in the works for at least a year.
I got it.
No one's punking anyone.
I mean, we discuss it at every single meeting.
You even contributed some ideas.
No one has ever thought to put a wolf on trial.
And what do you think, Max?
I think it should end with a... with a courtroom scene.
I think you might be a little distracted on the personal front.
I punked you guys.
I punked you, that was a... the reverse punk, so...
I pulled a switch on you.
I reversed it.
A lot of people find their 40th birthday challenging.
Your 40th birthday.
Well, there's some circular reasoning for you.
I have no fear of getting older.
It's just that all the choices disappear.
Everything's been decided for me.
I mean, I'm just locked into my life.
Who I'm married to, who my children are, what I do for a living, it's all done, all the doors are closed.
There's only one door I haven't walked through and I'm not eager to.
So you feel trapped?
I love my life.
I just sometimes wonder what would happen if it was blown to smithereens and I got to start all over again.
Is that crazy?
People blow up their lives all the time.
I'm not gonna wake up one morning and find out that Ethan is single, for example.
That's not the main thing I'm thinking about.
You bring that up in every session.
Well someone's keeping score.
I'm just observing a pattern.
And I'm observing a pattern, too.
Of hostile score keeping.
Hold on one second.
Hello.
Hey.
Welcome home, man!
I'm still on the plane.
I'm gonna call Ethan.
No, I don't want to do that.
I don't want him to even know that this is me.
Can you take a few steps away from him?
Alright.
You look so hot in those goggles, bro.
I just wanted to let you know that I am gonna tell Ethan what happened.
Unless you already have.
Just one person fucking the other person's dick off for eight hours.
Nick, look.
Don't fucking say anything, okay?
I've done this before and nothing good comes from it.
I can't live with this anymore, I can't.
I feel like I'm gonna throw up all the time.
Please don't, okay?
Bye.
What?
You don't even understand.
Ready for some service?
I'm gonna...
You are super in the way.
There we go.
Are you gonna be home when I get there?
Yeah, man, I'm planning on being home there and that you and I are gonna go to the party together.
Yeah, listen...
We need to talk before we go to Sam's.
We need to talk.
No...
We'll talk later, okay?
Okay, bye.
I'm good.
The gala, I am not looking forward to it.
She just called me from the runway and said we need to talk in person.
Nothing good ever happens when a wife says that.
Listen, I am going to tell Lisa everything.
This is a decision that we make together and I forbid you from talking about it.
I know that.
You don't get to blow up my marriage and my children's lives to alleviate your conscience.
If it helps, I will tell her I had the affair with someone else.
No, she won't.
Listen.
I wish it were as easy as telling Lisa and moving on, but it isn't.
It will change your marriage irrevocably and mine, too.
Obviously, but believe me, I've given this a lot of thought.
It's over.
We're done.
That's what matters.
Please don't ruin my life.
Please.
Mommy!
Hello, my loves!
Are you coming to karate with us?
Are you talking about...
We'll give those ones to the squirrels.
A storm system is over the Chesapeake, so we have to wait it out.
Shouldn't be much more than a half hour.
So we're gonna keep you here on the plane.
Hello again from the flight deck.
That storm system is lingering a bit.
But it shouldn't be more than an hour.
We're gonna hand out complimentary champagne to thank you for your patience.
Hello, folks, me again.
Traffic patterns are backed up all over, so we may be diverted to Newark.
We'll have more information in an hour.
I don't wanna go to this party.
Your next book after Wolf Trials.
Centaurs, half man, half horse.
Super buff, long hair, great posture, kind of forest dwelling.
You could just replace the word "werewolf" for "centaur" in the document.
Maybe we should see how Wolf Trials does first.
Yeah, although, you know, never too soon to get on that next idea or even replace the current idea with the new one.
Max, I'm sorry, I just...
I just finished a 400-page draft so I'm a little fucking tapped out right now.
You wrote 400 pages?
I just wanna fucking go home and see Lisa.
Can we just get on the train, please?
I want to cancel the party.
I don't want to celebrate getting old!
Come on, it's gonna be terrific!
It's too complicated.
Why can't we just go out to dinner?
I wish you'd told me that six months ago.
I did.
Oh.
Come on, it's gonna be great.
You're gorgeous.
Can you...
I wonder if there's time for me to take a nap.
Does it ever creep you out living in this house?
No, because I have nothing to hide.
It did creep me out a little bit when that bear threw the chair through the window.
That means that he was inside the house and wanted to get the hell out.
Whenever you see me zoning out, I'm thinking about that bear running around inside our house.
Creepy.
Doesn't make sense.
Where?
Now hit the brake.
Now put it in park.
You bet.
Hi.
Thank you so much for coming.
Hello!
I've got your membership papers.
Oh, God, look, there's Lisa.
Yay!
I sprained it.
You got some color.
Can I use your restroom just to wash my face and just kind of clean up?
I'll take her.
This is not what I thought I'd wear to your 40th but this is what I'm wearing.
It's just... in there.
Hand towel's on the bottom.
Before she brings it up first, okay?
Did you see how she just greeted me?
I need to talk to you.
Look, I haven't had a second to talk to Ethan yet.
I've been wanting to tell him everything to his face.
Stop it, this isn't funny, okay?
I'm not gonna be able to talk to him until we leave so let that inform your behavior.
Lisa, I want to introduce you to my fiancée, Dustry.
Like...
What is that?
This is my fiancée, Dustry.
We're engaged to be married.
Just like...
I want to show you these bouquets.
What for?
For our wedding.
Oh, yeah.
How were the Caymans?
Terrible.
Yeah.
Ladies and gentlemen, grab your coats and come on outside for a special presentation.
As you all know, my wife, Samantha, loves a good surprise.
Which is why your friends and I have organized a very special...
Night of surprises!
I helped with the sign!
It's beautiful, I love it.
For my first surprise, and don't worry, honey, because I've got a few, let me introduce Nils Michelson.
Come over here, everybody, gather round over here.
Right over here.
Can anyone tell me what the most dangerous weapon in the world is?
Now we all know it's bow and arrow, let's start the show.
Wow, look at that!
Alright, for my next surprise, let's all go into the dining room.
So let's just run lines one more time from the top.
Sorry!
This is one of the surprises in the Night of Surprises.
We gotta do it or else it's just a night.
In my experience, a performance has to answer two fundamental questions.
I think Marianne's right.
Agreed.
I think it's gonna be a lot of fun for everybody involved.
I never get to play the good characters.
It seems irrelevant and depressing, given the way things turned out.
Well, I think it's a great opportunity for people to relive my legacy.
I've gotta tell you, Bill, I think it's a bad idea.
It does not paint you in a good light.
And I wanna say that both of you were stupid, your wife and your daughter together, equal a six, okay?
She's a three, she's a two, they're a six.
That's faulty math.
Okay?
The students complained because the laughter was so loud nobody could study.
I don't know, the second you said students, it reminded me it was 20 years ago.
Maybe it doesn't hold up.
Max, the play sucks.
You suck, Marianne!
That stupid gender-bending Streetcar Named Desire play.
That was a disaster.
I'm sorry, that...
I get carried away when I put on the wig and I become Kenneth Starr and I just attack without provocation or evidence.
I get a little... "Monica-rena".
We gotta finish the show.
I look like a Hasidic Garth.
Good evening.
I am Kenneth Starr and I request your attention.
Guys, hands on hips.
Turn off the music.
Turn off the music.
It was shit and this is shit.
Sorry, my bad, I guess.
What's happening?
Well, that was great!
Thank you guys so much!
Hey, everybody, let's eat.
What's up?
Anastasia.
I didn't know she was invited tonight.
Okay.
This is my rabbit.
Not the imposter one that you tried to pass off on me, whom I love now, too.
Sam, get over here now.
You were supposed to take her to the vet, yet she ended up here, 50 miles away in Connecticut, in Sam's house, which means you two are still having an affair.
Hang on, how does she know about us?
How long have you known about us?
You're my family.
Oh, my God, Sam, you know what I mean.
Okay, I have to tell Lisa, okay?
She already knows, and apparently everybody else does too, and it'll make it better if I get to her first.
Please, Ethan, please don't, it's my birthday.
I'm gonna take Anastasia to the bedroom where she will eat most of your shoes.
Hey, is everything okay?
A toast.
To my wonderful husband, Jon.
We're so lucky to have so much.
Let's all reflect for a moment on our good fortune, which is so rare and so precarious in this world.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Perfect.
Okay, so I have one last surprise.
Hello, my beautiful friends.
Like the TV show?
Well, actually, The Mentalist was based on me.
Man, you must be loaded!
I, no...
No, they didn't...
I am here to tell you all what's in your minds.
Ken did a corporate retreat for us a few months ago and what he can do, it's just astounding.
No, no.
Okay.
Now, folks, I have been watching you at this little party all night.
And I just can't wait to get inside your heads!
Excuse me, True Blood.
Okay.
In the night sky.
That was my line!
Holy shit.
Guys, nothing is happening.
No, Max, nothing's happening right now.
How does he know everything about Tag?
Did you play the violin as a child?
Yes, I did!
You're gay.
It's a... great accomplishment of mine.
I see a man...
But Felix isn't, he's not here.
No, and that's sad.
Come to The Mentalist.
No, I think she needs a hug.
There we go.
She gets a hug.
Yeah, that's my fiancée.
Not with her.
Ooh!
Okay, this is not real, so don't worry.
We're all flesh and blood right here.
It's totally fake.
Now...
And just because of that, I'm going to you now.
I think someone is nervous because of the secret.
Oh!
Ah!
He!
I had sex with Nick.
Oh, my God!
When?
No.
Dustry.
This is what happened at the retreat.
So then why would you bring him to my birthday party?
Because I...
I told you I knew how to drive.
Can I try?
Cake, cake!
Cake!
Babe, I'm so sorry.
I was out of my mind.
I think... after the wedding...
I got crazy and I got paranoid and I thought something was happening between you and Sam.
God, I don't know how you can ever forgive me, but I...
I really hope that you do.
I forgive you.
What?
I said I forgive you.
I love you and that's all that matters.
Do you want me to be mad?
Would that make it better?
I think it would be better.
I don't think that I would do something like this unless I was trying to get a reaction from you.
Is Sam's car moving?
We have to stop the car.
We're not that important!
Hey, I should mention that someone in my department sold a book called Wolf Trials that I knew about but forgot existed.
Ow!
This thing has broke my foot!
No!
It's going in!
It's going in the pool.
Did you leave it in neutral?
Oh, no.
Why did you say, "Oh, no"?
I'm sorry about Wolf Trials.
Well, at least we still have your income, so...
Champagne?
Oh, that's funny.
That's not it.
I think we should take a break.
That's your last surprise tonight, sweetie.
