Previously on "Shades of Blue"...
I always wanted to be a good cop, but there's no straight line to that.
There's a rat on my team!
Wozniak's convinced that Saperstein's the mole.
I got a pretty good idea how that ends.
If I hadn't agreed to be an informant... if I would've just gone to Wozniak right after you arrested me...
You'd be in jail... or dead.
I really am who you think I am.
I'm also someone that you'd swear I'm not.
Tell me the whole truth, or I shoot you right here.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You know me!
She says he calls her Harlee.
Are you offering to bankroll a fresh start?
I can get it, but that has to happen away from me and Cristina.
Miguel is a calculating, unforgiving monster.
I lied to you about him being your father, but I was just trying to keep you safe.
I always told myself that the end would justify the means.
We're really gonna steal $12 million of confiscated drug money?
- [men grunting] - [gunshot]
How do you stop the pain?
What now?
But now that I'm at the end,
I can't justify anything.
What's Aunt Gemma doing here?
You're gonna be staying with her for a while.
What?
I cut the same deal, Harlee.
I was the mole.
It happened so slowly, I didn't realize.
[thud]
What, now we're gonna add breaking and entering to your rap sheet?
I was invited, Officer.
Got my own key.

I told you to stay away from her.
Do you really think you can pay me to slink away
[screams] Ten years!
Ten years you have dictated how I live my life.
Now I dictate how you live yours.
I know you.
I'm the only one who really knows you.
You're gonna take everything I give you, and you're gonna act like you like it, and you're gonna beg for more.
And I'm not just gonna punish you.
