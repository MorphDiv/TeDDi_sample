Danny:

There he is, and he's huge.
(chuckles)
You gotta admit, that's a big burrito.
Danny, do you remember this morning when you said I've been "edgy" for the last two months, and if I don't calm down, I'll never make it through the next 11?
First of all, honey, your math is off.
And second, you're about to see the next level of edgy if you don't stop messing around.
Because if we get thrown out of here and I lose my doctor,
I will rain down a level of edge on you you never even knew existed.
Doctor Hastings and I have been planning the birth of my first child since I was a little girl, and she is the only woman who can deliver this baby.
So if I lose my doctor, I lose my mind.
And if I lose my mind...

Don't we?

I think so.
- I'll go find the doctor.

(door opens)
I swallowed a penny when I was six and I wanted to see if it was still there.
Where's the doctor?
Honey,
Dr. Hastings has gone to a better place.
She switched hospitals?

Well, she's dead, so she probably didn't have time to call.
(theme music playing)
♪ It's amazing how the unexpected ♪
♪ Can take your life and change direction ♪
I'm just saying, if you're gonna call someone fat, you've gotta use your inside voice.
"Oh!

"Oh, oh.

More like Hell-A!
Oh, look, Uncle Tucker's getting snap, crackle, drunk for breakfast again.
Yeah, well there's no reason to be sober when you've got nowhere to go.
(scoffs)
I've got nowhere to go, man.
You'll find another job, dude.
Come on, just tell me what happened in LA.
Was it that bad?
No.

Yeah, I just missed you all so much,
I had to come back home.
Yes, it was bad!
Well, you gotta figure something out.
You're kind of pathetic.
Hold up.

How many times have you been to the dry cleaners this week, looking for some girl you saw two months ago for, like, two seconds?
Zero.
What's that in your hand?
You owe me 26.50 for your boxers.
Light starch.
I bet you don't even know her name.
Sure, I do.

(scoffs) Cute.
And it wasn't once, it was three times.
That has got to mean something.
Not really.
No, I ran into Bald Marcia from that weird yogurt kabob place four times yesterday, and I don't want to have sex with her.
I bet you don't even remember what she looks like.
Course I do.
She has beautiful... red...
- Brown.

- Blue.

And is about this...
- More.

(phone vibrates)
Oh, my God, dude.

Emma!

I posted one of those Missed Connections, and she answered!
She's been looking for me like I've been looking for her.
I think I am gonna wear my favorite black shirt.
- Blue.

I mean, how can Dr. Hastings be dead?
She was such a vibrant 87.
What am I supposed to do now?
- "We," what are we supposed...

Not we.

Only one of us is growing a human being in their uterus and having it yanked out by a stranger in six months.
Hey, why don't we just ask my mom for her doc?
I mean, she pretty much has the same lady parts.
Oh, God, I think I just ruined sex.
Danny, you cannot tell your mother that my gyno died.
All right?

Yesterday, she told me it's okay to drink because I'm still not showing and no one will know.
Okay, you have to promise me that you will keep her away from me.
I promise.
But she and Brad are leaving in a couple days for their around-the-world tour, so you won't have to deal with it for about a year.
Oh, sweetie, are you okay?

A year?
(crying) I'm just so happy.
Oh.
Hey, Riles.
I just found the most amazing cream for your nipples.
My nipples are fine.
They won't be.
Yeah.

Okay, hey.

Why am I hiding your passport?
Because I'm not going with Brad to Peru or Kathmandu or, or any place ending in "ooh."
What are you gonna tell him?

Which is exactly why you're going to tell him that I can't leave because Riley needs me.
I'm not sure she does.
Sweetie, it's her first baby.
The first always needs extra attention.
The second baby, that's when you can start slacking.
Listen, there's gonna be some problems.
Oh, there already are.
Her lady doc just died.
That was a secret.
Why don't you just take her to my guy?
Dr. Marsh.
So hot.
There's nothing like a sexy mechanic working under the hood.
Sorry.

Remember, you and Riley can't live without me.
Mm?
Danny!

I need you to convince your mom to go away with me.
You need to let her know that you and Riley will be perfectly fine here on your own.
So that's two "go" and one "stay."
Never quite sure you and I are paddling up the same river.
Yes, for the last time, I'll move on if this doesn't work out.
But it's gonna work out.
Crap, do I have time to work out?
Maybe just a couple push-ups?
Ben:

No.
I knew that.
(phone vibrates)
"Hey, I'm here.

Aw, man, it's the wrong Missed Connection.
Now, what do I do?
Go connect with that girl.

But she's not my girl.
But she could be.
Dude, she's obviously single.

And as desperate as you are.
And she thinks her guy didn't come, so her self-esteem is at an all-time low.
Man, even Emma could go in there and get her.
Tucker, Dry Cleaner Girl and I are gonna be married someday.
Which means I should probably get as much as I can before then.

Aw.
It's just like how your Daddy met your Mommy.
He didn't know her name either.
Die, die, die!
Oh!
"The do's and don'ts of diaper rash."
- This is gonna be fascinating.

Ah, pretending to care.
You're gonna be a great Dad.
I just needed a little break from Riley.
If only there was somebody around who's been through this before, you know, some kind of mother figure who could help.
Right, a mother figure, like you.

But weren't you just saying what a wonderful idea this trip is and how it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?
Yes.

Yeah, yeah.

That might have come up as well.
But this trip is just so important to us.
Exactly.

Really?
You heard the man.

Yeah, I heard him say that we should stay.
Well, perhaps he's just confused.
How could he be confused?

Danny?

Oh, Riley, I missed you.
Oh!

I got an appointment with that doctor you found, the one who treats all the Rangers' wives.
Wait.

Ew, no.
Oh, I can't wait to meet this completely different doctor than my mom's.
- Let's go.

Well, that's not how I thought this day was gonna turn out.
Heh.

But we definitely connected.
I mean, I connected first, but then you did too, right?
Sure.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
It's her!
Her?

Her.

So, uh...

The one on the left is my friend, Amanda.
And the other one, I don't really know. "L" something.
Well, "L" what?
Laura, Lisa, Linda?
Man, I had a good Linda once.
I had a good Lisa twice.
Uh, uh, but the other woman, the one you're friends with, she looks super familiar.

No.
(mouths words)
She does work around the corner, though.
(mouths word)
Right, uh, at the place next to the other place.
The lingerie store on "A."
That's it.

I...

With my mom.
We got a weird, uh...
Hey, I'll talk to you later.
Obviously I had to leave LA.

You would have done the same thing if that happened to you.
Thank you, Dr. Emma.
I found her!
Yeah, I know.

No.

The dry-cleaner- scooter-taxi her.

I found this at Olivia's house.
The girl from the bar.

Dude, this is great.

Well, probably not, since we just had sex.
Hello, baby.
Oh, I just told her it's another word for cookie.
It's all right.
But all I gotta do is find this chick Amanda who will lead me to my chick.
My chick.
Oh, my God.

This is her, right?
Yes.
Wait.

Well, obviously I'm not gonna see her again.
Come on, man.

I can't cheat on... "L" something.
(ultrasound whooshing)
Riley:

Is that the heartbeat?
That's the heartbeat.

He's just like my burrito.
Except we made this together.
Well, I will tell you one thing.
You won't forget this birth.
I know.

No, I mean it's probably going to split you from tip to tail.
It's gonna be huge.
So you can say goodbye to this bod.
What have you done to me?
All right, it's gonna be okay.

I'm gonna go talk to the doctor about his bedside manner.
Hey, Doc.

By the way, last time I had a pretty quick breast exam.
Tell the doctor to take his time today.
Oh.

Great stuff in there, by the way, but I got a quick heads up for you.
How can I help?
Bonnie Wheeler is also a patient of yours, and, well, I'm Danny Wheeler.
And my girlfriend, Riley, would "rain down a level of edge"
I didn't even know existed if she finds out that both of them are seeing the same doctor.
"And we both know how that goes.

Oh, heh.

That's sort of my big little secret.
Yeah, I can see the problem.
Oh, thanks, Doc.
You might have just saved my life.
What up, Doc?
Bonnie.

Tee-rrific.
Sorry I haven't been here in a while, but I got married.
I know.

- Did we?

Anyway, he's much younger than me and he gets very jealous.
Yeah, Bonnie, we need to talk.
All right.

Your husband was just here.
Mm-hmm?
And I think he got another woman pregnant.
(shrieks) What?
That's weird.

(laughs) Oddly enough, that is how Bonnie and I learned that we are allergic to latex.
Yo, can we just watch TV, man?
I did it!
I am one step closer to finding Dry Cleaner Girl.
Some chick he's never met but is in love with.

That sounds so romantic.
Her name is Amanda and she's best friends with "L" something.
Oh, so you told her you're in love with her friend?
Well, I meant to, but it would have been super awkward after we just had sex.
You had sex with her too?
Yeah.

Huh.

Yeah, man, you might want to leave that part out when you finally meet her.
Which I will be doing tonight because Amanda just invited me to a barbecue that "L" something will be at.
Fate apparently has my back.
(chuckles) And what's gonna happen when you see her?
Oh, good question.
(inhales sharply) I mean, a handshake seems super cold considering we are gonna be married one day and... probably move to Connecticut with our dog, Dude, Emma, and our three boys...
Bennie, Benjamin, and Benzo.
So I guess I'll go with a hug?
Yeah, I meant what do you think Amanda is going to do since she invited you to be her date?
Good point, Tuck.

Right.

Why don't you come with me and hit on Amanda?
She's kind of a sure thing.
Wait, wait, wait.

What if she's there?
Aw, damn it.

Olivia!

Trapeze artist.

Please don't tell your mother.
Oh, this is perfect.
Why don't you come and take care of Olivia if she becomes a problem.
I love you, son.
But I don't think I should kill for you.
And... he took her to my doctor.
My doctor.
How could he get another woman pregnant?
- Well, there's gotta be another explanation.

That doesn't sound like our Brad at all.

Hm.

Then what's he doing in Brooklyn when he said that he was at a golf course in Jersey?
I had him chipped like a dog the day I met him.
I didn't know you could do that.
I got a guy.
Ironically... his name is Chip.
Okay.

We are going to Brooklyn to get to the bottom of this.
All right, you and Brad need to stay together so you can go on your super long trip to all those wonderful places where there's no Wi-Fi, or reception, or any other means of communicating with the outside world.
What you two have is so special.
You're an inspiration to us.
And...

Oh.
Too far?
I wasn't listening.
(indistinct conversations)
All right, huddle up, boys.
See, this is why we don't play sports on the weekends.
Okay.
I think we're gonna need to divide and conquer.
Because so far, there have been no "L" something sightings.
Ooh!

Tucker, get to flirting.
Okay.

I am ready to flirt.

Start discreetly asking around about Olivia.
- (shouts) Olivia!

(whispers) Right.

Where... are... you?
Hey there. (chuckles)
Man, I know this was a barbecue, but nobody told me that there'd be honey biscuits.
I'm Tucker.
Maybe you didn't hear me.

Oh, that's how it's gonna be?
Do we know each other?
We could, but you keep playing.
Ah, here she is, my blushing bride.
I swear, I'm the luckiest man alive.
Aw!

I think I just met someone really special, too.
Aw, sweetie.
I just told you I have a wife.
Look, I just started seeing someone.
It's fine.
No skin off my back.

I'm only doing a friend a favor who pretty much guaranteed me that you were a sure thing.
- Excuse me?

She knows me so well.
Sometimes I think she's got a GPS planted in me.
Aha!

Bon-Bon, what are you doing here?
Busting you with your "who-er."
- Excuse me?

What are you, like, four?

Uh, look, I don't know who any of you people are, but I'm not pregnant and I happen to have a new boyfriend.
I'm dating Ben Wheeler.
You're dating my son and my husband?
Even I wouldn't do that.
You had sex with my dad.
Are you ever gonna let that go?
(scoffs)
Olivia, did you just say you're dating Ben Wheeler?
Yeah.

Because I just started dating Ben Wheeler.
Wow!

Classic Ben.

Danny, what are you doing here?
Oh, hey, Olivia.
Amanda.

I'm just going to, um...

I see what's going on here.
You do?
Yeah.

Bonnie, I swear.

I did!
Oh!

I got you pregnant.
And Dr. Marsh is my mom's doc.
I lied to you because I knew he was a good doctor, and I wanted you to have the best because you're carrying our baby and I love you.
Brad,
Mom doesn't want to go away for a year.
She already missed one grandchild being born, she doesn't want to miss another.
Is this true?
You don't want to leave?
Look, honey, I love you.
But I am not a rough-it kind of a gal.
Okay?

Oh.
Oh, and, honey, thanks for trying to help.
I'm sorry I put so much pressure on you.
Yeah.

Come on.
- Oh!

Ooh, look, everyone's happy now.

Not so fast, Wheeler.
Isn't there something you wanna say?
All right, I'll try the truth.
Uh, look...

"L" something.
Her name is Elle, you idiot.
E-L-L-E.
No way!

That's perfect.
Okay, fine.

I slept with you, and you, and I think her a long time ago.
But we had some fun, right?
And it wasn't all my fault.
I mean, you were a little desperate and you are very flirty.
And the bottom line is,
I did who I had to do to get to Elle.
And I'll do it again.
Let's hug it out?
Elle doesn't live here anymore.
She moved away last month.
Right.
I don't suppose you'd give me her number?
- Or her address?

You know what?

I have to.
'Cause we're meant to be.
I'm out.
That's the alley, that's the alley.
Aw, come on.
Oh, hey, guys.
Oh, Elle, when did you get here?
Oh, just a few minutes ago.
Why?

Let's just say you dodged a bullet.
We don't actually know anyone here, do we?
- No.

Go, go.

Come on, just give me a hint about LA.
Was it embarrassing?
Can I find it on the Internet?
Do you need help burying a body?

I will never tell you.
He told you, didn't he?
Yes.
How bad is it?
Bad.
Are you gonna tell me?
No.
Are you gonna save it to blackmail Tucker later?
Yes.
I've never been so proud.
