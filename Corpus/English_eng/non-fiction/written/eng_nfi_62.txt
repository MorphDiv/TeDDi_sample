Thanks for seeing me.
- I'm just such a mess right now.

Is that Edie?

Craig has been gone for almost two days.
He won't answer his phone.

Plus, our wedding caterer keeps calling about the appetizers...

I told her just double them.
Shh.

Or drink a whole lot of wine and get real crazy!
Linda, you want to get crazy?

Again I am so sorry about this Zorn thing.
Honestly, it's fine.
I have no feelings for Zorn, which is why this whole Craig thing is so crazy.
"Zorn and I were meant to be together"?
If that were true, we'd still be married, and I wouldn't owe him ten chickens a month.
- Zephyrian alimony is so weird.

I'll tell you what you're gonna do.
You're gonna come with me, and we're gonna go find your fiancé together, if that's what you really definitely want to do.
Like, 100% for sure.
- How are you going to do that?

I'm a world-class hunter, all right.
Now, of course, I've never taken my prey alive,
- but how different can it be, right?

- Oh, hell yeah.

Chasing a guy who doesn't want to be found is not my ideal way to get out of town, but hey,
- a vacation's a vacation.

- All right.

It took me, like, 45 minutes to squeeze into, so...
Oh, absolutely not.
- Not in my car.

Yeah.
The zipper...
Come on, Alan.

I didn't think you were really gonna make me do this.
I only agreed 'cause...

Can I tell you a secret?
I would have made out with you anyway.

- Come on!

♪ I see you walking ♪
- # Walking down the street #

Alan's got Zephyrian legs!
- Oh, my God, they're into it?

People love it when you're different.
Let your freak flag fly, Son of Zorn.
Ah, well, I've called everyone who would know where Craig is, and no one does.
Wow, you are much less freaked out after a little wine.
Hey, we should take you to a vineyard if Craig turns up dead.
Anyway, want to hand me that sweater?
I'm in hunter mode now, so I apologize in advance if it's turning you both on sexually.
Uh, turn left up here.
So just by smelling Craig's sweater,
Zorn can catch his scent and track him?
Zorn's nose is incredibly powerful.
Ooh, ooh, is that Craig?
No, no, that's a baby crawling in a field of jasmine.
Okay, turn right now.

- Turn right, Linda!

I'm in the left lane.
Remember when you tracked Skunkman?
Oh, Skunkman, that's right!

Yeah, and he was so hammered he got married to the wrong woman by accident.
And that marriage lasted 21 years.
Could have gone longer if he hadn't had his tiny rodent skull crushed.
His wife ended up getting it stuffed and mounted.
So those little glass eyes stare at her now as she sleeps.
Love is just a beautiful, strange, weird sexy thing.
So... do I need to turn anytime soon or...
Linda, we're reminiscing and honoring the memory of my dear friend Skunkman.

Oh, you should have turned back there.
Hey, guys, thank you so much for letting me stay here.
Of course!

Or for an investor in my new business.
Luckily, while you're here, you can be both.
Oh, what happened to the DJ classes that I paid for?
I finished them, but all the DJ jobs want you to work at night, and that's when I go clubbing.
Look, I talked to Edie.
She's looking for you.

Oh.

Edie just has some stuff she needs to work out with her ex-husband, Zorn.
But I think those two are gonna be real happy together.
Those two go together like peanut butter and steak.
Ah, my food truck.

Because people are idiots, Robert.
Well, everything happens for a reason.
My failed dog-walking business, face grease for people who can't sweat.
Those were steps down a path to bring me to my true calling...
Rob Ross's Artisanal Blackberry Moonshine.
Hmm.
I'm gonna open a distillery.

- Mm.

I brewed it up in your old fish tank.
Ooh, look what I got, Edie.

What is this, traffic school?
Hey, don't worry.

- Edes, Jewel of Mumbasca?

Here we go.
Sorry, Officer, we were in a rush.
We have to get this rare jewel to a museum.
Maybe he could take this priceless, untraceable jewel on his police motorcycle.

I mean, the Jewel of Mumbasca, which could quickly be unloaded at any pawnshop, is worth, oh, I'd say, hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Are you seriously trying to bribe a police officer?
Frankly, I am offended you would even think such a thing!
Why don't you look directly into this jewel, clear your mind, and then tell me if you really think we're trying to bribe you.
- And there he goes.

Let's go.

We used to use that trick all the time in Zephyria.
It's gotten us out of six speeding tickets, and a ton of public nudity charges.
Yeah, nobody ran faster naked than Edie.
If the cops showed up, she was just a blur of peach.
Yeah.

I used to pull some scams, too.
- Oh, really?

- My sisters and I would unscrew arcade games...

We were swimming in teddy bears.
Yeah, no, I got an app that lets me swap people's faces, but I did it with our genitals.
I didn't even know that was possible.
Hey, if you like that one, you should see the one I did with LeBron James and Shailene Woodley.
Just disturbing.
Son of Zorn!

Son of Zorn...
Yeah!
Oh, that was a good one.
Alan, what are you doing?

Oh, no, that's someone else's backpack...

- like, five backpacks ago.

Think you can kick something a little bigger?

- Very impressive, Zorn.

I once tracked down Needle Man in the Mountains of Haystack.
Craig, it's Edie!

And I only want to be with you!
- Oh...

PartyGirl82.

I was starting to believe all my friends, who said you weren't real.
Um, there must be some mistake.
Wait, a minute.

Hey, hey, hey, I'd know that lame-ass sweater anywhere.
Where'd you dump Craig's body, you psycho?

Did you keep that horrible cardigan as some sort of sick trophy?
I bought it at the Goodwill in Fullerton Hills.
That's all I can afford after sending all my money to partygirl here.
All right, this one's on Craig for being so dang charitable.
I'm so sorry, I thought you were my fiancé.
- I am, according to your letters.

- Oh, God, what are we gonna do?

I made a mistake, but I can fix it.
It's not like we have to do anything crazy, okay?
Oh, I know, I'll summon a hawk.
No, Zorn.

- No, come on, it'll be fun.

So he's just gonna ask the hawk
- where Craig is?

He's just gonna swap minds with a hawk.

I am one loss away from being the losingest coach in all of California state history.
And my kicker just got deported.

What?

Have you seen me?
I look like a walking bag of wet sand, so...
You felt real cool today, didn't you?
Probably for the first time in your life.

I've got a jersey, size boys medium, in this drawer
- with your name on it.

Wow!

This coach has seen your wet sandbag of a body, right?
Yeah.

- to the game Friday, right?

My son is playing in his first-ever football game.
You bet your ass I'll probably be there.
Hey, and good luck with, uh, whatever you guys are doing.
Finding your stepfather.
- Oh, yeah, right.

McMurphey's about to jump off your roof!
Hey, well, have fun with that.

- We really raised a great son.

I mean, I married you because you had a smoking-hot ass.
I didn't know you'd also have smoking-hot parenting skills.
Well, you're not so bad yourself, Zorn.
- Linda is a lucky girl to have you.

I mean, Linda's beautiful and fun, and now she can sit in the back of a car without making a sound for what feels like an hour, right?
She's not back there, is she?

Congratulations, Craig, you're a millionaire.
That's what people are gonna say in a few years
- when your shares in the company have value.

- Today you owe me $10,000.

- Ross Brothers Moonshine.

- I didn't agree to that.

Hey, look, I'm gonna get out of here and go cash this check.
- Okay.

- Good old Craig.

Have you not seen the pattern?
You left Edie because you thought she'd be happier with someone else.
You're constantly funding Robert's businesses, even though they have no hope of working out.
Well, "no hope" is a little strong.
Craig, you and I went to the Dartmouth formal together, and when your brother asked me to dance, you left without saying good-bye and transferred to Chico State.
And look how well that turned out.
I get that you like making other people happy, but you can't sacrifice your own happiness to do it.
Hmm.

I should've never given away the woman that I love.
I have waited so long to hear you say that.
I'm coming, Edie!
Okay.

I'm sorry.

Okay.
- So, kicker, huh?

Thanks for pushing me to show my legs.
Oh!

Son of Zorn!
I promised you a jersey with your name on it,
I delivered a jersey with your name on it.
- Whoa!

- Yeah!

Yeah, that sounds awesome!
Alan, I-I thought we were hanging out after school.
Oh!
Maybe we need to give these two a second.
I'm sorry.
No, I just did that because I'm so lonely.
That's on me.
- Just, please...

Dude'slegsrule!
Yeah.

Layla.

Hey, aren't you happy for me?

Alan, I thought we were going to your mom's house to hang out.
- Do you not want to hang out?

It's just, these are, like, the guys!

This is starting to feel like the real me.
Great.

- maybe I'm not into the real you.

Layla.

Well, we're never gonna make it to Sacramento tonight, so, uh...

A night at a motel with me and my ex-wife.
It's too far and we're too tired.
Oh, you know, I could've scored us some crystal meth back at that truck stop you left me at for three hours.
Linda!

And we bought you some Combos and the Best of Toto
- on cassette tape.

Oh, perfect.

Oh, come on, Linda.

Edie and I have shared a bed with another human before.
Actually, humans.

O-Okay.

15, 16 humans.
Completely lost track of Edie at one point.
Oh, and full disclosure.

Well.

We were in a refugee camp.
The orgies there were real downers.
Uh, but you know what, Linda?

You guys can even share it together.

What, and make you sleep on the floor?

What is this, our home in Zephyria?
Yeah.

Hey.

Okay, I want you to be honest with me.
- Okay.

I think that pause tells me everything I need to know.
Linda!
So, I was on my way to go get a bed, when I found this treasure trove.
Look at that.

Spoils go to the victor!
No, that's dip spit.

Wait, she just left?

People don't just suddenly get up and leave their partners.
I mean, have you ever in your life heard of that happening?
- I have.

She thinks...

Wait, hold on.

Craig's letter put the idea in my head, and then when Linda asked if we still had feelings for each other,
I don't know, I guess I just hesitated a little too long.
Well, yeah.

Of course you hesitated, because you can't handle that I've have moved on.

Have this, and these.
I paused for a second!

Maybe the real reason she's leaving you is because of your insane narcissism.
Narcissism?

I am taking the bed.
And just so it's crystal freaking clear,
I'm willing to let you have sex with me one time, because I'm sad about Linda leaving me.

Don't you walk out of here.

I'm right in this argument, and that does not happen a lot!
So you get back here and apologize to me!

A small one.

- Get away from my fiancé.

What?

I'm so glad you're here.
I don't care what you're glad about.
Well, I do, but now I also care what I'm glad about.
Oh, man, it's good to see you.
I tell you, you are engaged to one crazy B.
I mean, we had some good times, yes, but you are doing me a huge favor taking her off my hands.
- Well, how did you find us?

Oh, yeah, that would have been a really good way to find you.
But, you know, this way let me use my Starwood points, so we both win, huh?
I don't care what pleasures of the flesh has happened in this bawdy motel room.
- Absolutely none.

But it ends here.
If Edie will have me back, I want to be back.
Forever.
And I don't care if it makes anyone else unhappy.
Craig!

- Ooh, my Cwaigy!

You changed the "R" to a "W" and it sounded like a kid said it.
You know, now that I think about it,
I really should've just mind swapped with Craig right away, and we would have known exactly where to find him.
That's such a handy trick to have.

Oh, that's right.

Hut!

Hey, Linda!

What?

That's usually a top shelf icebreaker.
Well, I invited her.
I told her all the confusion on the trip was my fault.
Hey, Linda, uh, I'm glad you could come.
Edie told you it was all her fault, right?
She did, but I'm still a little mad at you.
I am so, so sorry Linda.
That's not how I wanted our first road trip to go.
I wanted it to be sweet and special, and to include sex in at least six different rest areas and/or jetted tubs.
I-I promise you that I won't ever take you for granted again.
And as a symbol of that promise, well, here, I got you these.
Oh, Zorn.

Thank you.
All right, I forgive you.
Plus, my apartment's being fumigated, so I need a place to stay tonight.
Zorn, aren't those the cursed
Crystals of Cuwathahara?
- Yes.

Oh!

- Son of Zorn!

- Come here!

Hey, coach, what do you need?
- What do I need?

Maybe a little validation in my life, considering the Booster Club didn't even tell anybody that we were having a game!
But I'll take a field goal and a win.
- I can...

- Right now?

- Okay.

Here we go!

Let's go, Alan!

Fire it up!
Take control!
Domination!
Grind the bones of your enemies to dust and ravage their elders!
Break!
Son of Zorn!

Son of Zorn!

Hut!
- Ooh!

Need a medic!
Woo-hoo!
Way to go, Son of Zorn!
Oh, man, you totally killed that kid!
I heard so many bones break!
Wha...

I don't think I understand the rules of this game.
- Hey...

I lost the game, lost my new friends and Layla, so I'm the worst.
Hey, I don't know you that well, but I'm pretty sure you're not the worst.
But like I said, I don't know you that well.
Well, you know what?

And don't you forget that.
No matter what I say in civil court when that poor paralyzed boy's family decides to sue us.
Ugh, he will never be the same, that kid.
You know, I never seen a live femur before.
Don't worry, Alangulon.

Now, the sound of that boy's body breaking?
That's probably gonna haunt you for the rest of your life.
