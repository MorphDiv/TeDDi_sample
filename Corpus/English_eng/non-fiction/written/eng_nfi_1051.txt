I WANT TO INFORM ALL THE MEXICAN PEOPLE
THAT JOAQUÃN GUZMÃN LOERA HAS BEEN CAPTURED.
[sending message] [journalist] The head of the Sinaloa cartel... [journalist] President Enrique Peña Nieto, confirmed the head of the Sinaloa cartel has been recaptured whose escape was a humiliation to his administration.
Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán, the drug lord, has been arrested.
[in French] El Chapo, one of the most wanted drug lords...
One of the most wanted men in the world is back behind bars tonight.
He was detained in the city of Los Mochis.
Six months after escaping from a maximum security prison... [in Japanese] Mexican authorities have recaptured Guzmán.
The drug lord's escape destabilized the Mexican government.
Recapturing him has even become an affair of state.
[journalist] Journalists from all over the world are here today.
At the PGR's hangar at the international airport in the City of México, on board that ANX-2226 of the Mexican Navy.
[journalist] We can now see Chapo coming out of the truck.
[journalist] Correct.

He's had a change of clothes.
They are showing him to the media.
They don't let him speak.

[journalist] Ana Paula, they are taking him now.
[journalist] He is not allowed to speak to the media.
Now they're stopping.
They are showing his face to the media.

ALTIPLANO PRISON, MEXICO 2016
[keys clinking]
It's great!
Thank you, Joaquín.
There're some details missing, but we're almost done.
Next time do something to cool this place down?
Do you want me to build you another one?
A lot more, my engineer.
This is only the first one.
I want it finished before I return.
When are you traveling?
Today.
[climbing the ladder]
[laughing]
I was getting bored waiting for so long.
[sighs]
For complaints, my wife, babe.
This is my golden chance with Mr. Miguel Ãngel.
[water running]
Which wife?
Both of them.
[engineer] Excuse me.
What's up, engineer?
Joaquín, what you're asking for is impossible.
I need more time to finish it.
Too bad.

Hey, let's go.
You have to finish it.
- Don't let me down.

What's the hurry?

MEXICO CITY, HEADQUARTERS OF THE WORKERS' INSTITUTIONAL PARTY [chatter]
[Conrado] Good morning.

[secretary] Yes, sir.
If you say so, sir.
Yes...
Yes, I made the call myself.
Once again, yes, sir.
If the governor didn't answer, it's not my fault.
Sir, the thing is, the governor has gained a lot of power.
No, sir, I'll handle it.
I've made a report on the governor.
All right, sir, as you wish.
[thumps table]
JALISCO STATE GOVERNMENT
[keys jingling] [papers shuffling] [keys jingle] [steps moving away]
If this son of a bitch gets canned, what will happen to us?
[journalist] Rafael Caro Quintero was captured!
Key figure in Latin American drug trafficking.
and amongst the most important in the international drug trade.
Moreover, he's presumed to have killed the American agent
Enrique Camarena Salazar and his Mexican pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
Enrique Camarena Salazar, special agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration was conducting an undercover investigation in Guadalajara, Mexico to smash a ring of drug traffickers.
He was kidnapped, tortured brutally... and killed.
[journalist] The detained drug traffickers are members of the Guadalajara Cartel, headed by Miguel Ãngel Félix Gallardo.
Their names are Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, aka Don Neto.
Your uncle is a badass, Amado.
AMADO CASTILLO, "THE LORD OF THE SKIES" HEAD OF JUÃREZ CARTEL and Rafael Caro Quintero, who has been identified as the man responsible for the torture and murder of the DEA agent.
[journalist] Do you have any regrets?
Well... what should I say?
I never feel regret.
What's done is done.

- What can I do?

What's your relationship with Félix Gallardo?
- None.

No, sir.

Thank you, Rafael.
You'll be missed.
MIGUEL ÃNGEL, "THE GODFATHER" HEAD OF THE GUADALAJARA CARTEL [journalist] This unfortunate event has stirred an unprecedented diplomatic crisis between Mexico and the USA.
In 1985, the Mexican drug business was controlled by the Guadalajara cartel
The cartel was run by Miguel Ãngel, "The Godfather,"
who had a group of drug lords under his command.
El Chapo was working for him with hopes of becoming a drug lord...
MIGUEL ÃNGEL'S HOUSE
Set it up.
What's up, Chapo?
I'm on my way out.
The tunnel is finished.
I'm ready to throw some blow to the other side.
I can move several tons across the border.
You only have to put me in contact with Escobar.
[engine sputters]
You're trying to bite off more than you can chew.
It's the quickest and safest way to move it across.
Our man in Colombia... is Amado, not you.
Leave it to him.
Keep working with marijuana.
And don't screw it up.
There's plenty of cocaine for everybody, Miguel Ãngel.
[engine turns over]
The more we move across the border, the better.
Stop with all that crap.
If you really want to help the organization, go pick Amado up at the airport.
I'm not a chauffeur.
You work for me.
And right now, that's what I want you to do.
[plane flies overhead]
What now?

WORKERS' INSTITUTIONAL PARTY
[keys clinking]
- [Miguel Ãngel] Amado!

- How was your trip?

How are the guys?

[phone dials]
What's up, Barranquillero?
Are we going to do some business or not?
[Chapo] Don't let me down.

Let's go, Rayo!
Barranquillero is waiting for us.

Wait a second, buddy.

He said he wouldn't introduce me to Escobar.
He never said I couldn't introduce myself.
[Rayo over radio] I hope you're sure about this.
ANTIOQUIA, COLOMBIA PABLO ESCOBAR'S ESTATE
They are going to kill us, buddy.
[car door opens]
I'm Joaquín Guzmán Loera.
Call Barranquillero.

All right, partner.
This is your only chance.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

Call Barranquillero.
García.
Someone is looking for Barranquillero.
[car approaching]
[car door opens]
[steps approaching]
Is he going to see me?
If not, you'd be dead already.
García.
This is Chapo.

You only get five minutes, okay?
[García] Sir.
Don Pablo.
Thanks for seeing me today.
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.
Barranquillero may trust you, but I don't.
Do something that feels off, and I'll kill you, son of a bitch.
Miguel Ãngel didn't send me here.
I came on my own account.
This kid turned out to have some balls.
As your people say, small but spicy.
Okay, then...
Tell me quickly.

We're getting tired of Amado's late deliveries.
You're saying you can deliver faster?
Exactly, Mr. Pablo.
Amado delivers in five days.

No, my boy.
If he wants, he can do that too.
He's just too damn lazy.
Hey, man, take this shorty away.
- Come on, move.

I can move it across the border and deliver in 48 hours.
Chapo...
Do you know what happens to those who fail me?
Yes, Mr. Pablo.
So, you can deliver one ton in 48 hours?
Prove it and we can start talking business.
[steps moving away]
[Chapo] We need to cross one ton.

[Rayo] Forty-eight hours, buddy?

Keep an eye on García.
He shouldn't start counting until the planes take off.
Okay.
I'll see that everything is set to land in CancÃºn.
All right.
How is it going, García?

[Rayo] Come on, guys!

Take this.

CANCÃN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
GENERAL DIRECTOR FEDERICO FERNÃNDEZ
[airplane lifting off]
[Joaquín] Rayo, can you hear me?
The airport director is in.
Let me know when you are ready to take off.
[grunts, groans] [grunts, groans]
[man] Guys!
[man] Hurry up!
Let's go!
[moans]
Here he is, sir.
[Miguel Ãngel] You thought you would get away with it?
- What the hell did I tell you?

Don't give me that shit, Chapo.
It's the end of the line.
Let me do this.
If I'm successful, you'll have more benefits as the boss.
[sighs]
If I fail...
I'm going to die anyway.
Rules are rules.
And you broke all of them.
I saw the opportunity... and I just took it.
Escobar is not happy with Amado's late deliveries.
If I can deliver in 48 hours, he'll do more business with us.
It's a win-win situation, Don Miguel.
This son of a bitch thinks he's a badass.
[Amado] Let him try, Miguel.
When he fails,
Escobar will do us a favor and kill him.
[gun clicks]
[Escobar] Chapo...
Do you know what happens to those who fail me?
[airplane flying]
- [Chapo] We'll take off in 20 minutes.

García!
[Chapo] Welcome to Mexico!

Let me remind you that you only have 36 hours left.
I'll have time to spare, son of a bitch.
Conrado, the Party Leader wants to see you.
He's in the meeting room.
WORKERS' INSTITUTIONAL PARTY [party leader] Listen, guys!
I sacked your useless boss for being such an asshole.
Now, I want to hear your advice.

The Governor of Jalisco is trying to escape the fold.
How can we avoid that?

My advice is to reconcile, sir.
If we organize a meeting with the governor, he'll understand it's best to stay on your side.
By avoiding confrontation, his loyalty towards the party and towards you will strengthen.
Do you agree?
No.
In this case, I recommend you go for the scandal.
A media scandal with the information we have that the governor was laundering Caro Quintero's money... with that, he'll weaken for sure.
We can take advantage that the news of Quintero's arrest
- is fresh out of the oven.

We can even threaten him with a few days in prison... with his ex-partner.
Corruption...

That would only scare him for a while.
It's not going to win his loyalty.
Sorry, sir, but someone who was a traitor once... will never be loyal again.
Is there something else?
Yes, if I may add something,
I think that by scaring him a bit he'll return to the fold, but only a good ass-kicking will guarantee that he'll never leave the fold again.
DEADLINE FOR DELIVERY
[whistles]
[man on radio] Everything okay in Guadalajara.
[García] Thank you, sir.
I heard landing here was more complicated, but so far everything is great.
[Rayo] Great?
The real fun is only starting.
Let's go.
[airplane flying]
[Chapo] Engineer, we're flying over Sonora.
Get the tunnel ready.
Attention, guys!

[García] We're almost there?
Is that the runway?
That's the one!
[airplane flying]
[García] Son of a bitch!

- GÃ¼ero.

HERIBERTO "EL GÃERO" PALMA DRUG LORD
- Where are the Colombians?

[airplane approaching]
What's he doing?

Give me the radio.
[airplane approaching]
The runway is not that long.
You're flying too fast.

Slow down!
He'll crash!
Slow down!

[airplane crashes]
Shit!
What happened, García?
- For the nerves.

Next time, you should slow down.
García, this is GÃ¼ero.
- GÃ¼ero, García.

- How are you?

[Rayo] Wait a second.
Buddy, your brother.
[GÃ¼ero] Be more careful, next time.
What's up, Pollo?
[Rayo] You have to slow down...
What's wrong?
My damn father is dying.
He wants to see me.
- What are you going to do?

It's the judicial police.
They're on our side.
[honking] [trucks approaching]
What's up, Commander?

Tell your men to put the guns down.
What happened, Commander?
Is your payment late?
I have direct orders to seize this shit.
Don't give me that shit.
Direct orders from whom?
You'll have to ask my boss.
There's no need to ask questions, buddy.
There's enough money for you and your boss.
The boss was very clear, Chapo.
Put the guns down!
Otherwise, you'll be the first one to die.
Put the guns down.
Go ahead!
All yours.
DEADLINE FOR DELIVERY
It's nothing personal, Chapo.

[truck engine turns over] [phone ringing]
[man] Sir, García is on the phone.
Yes, sir.

What an asshole!
Did you tell him we lost the packages?
I couldn't.

Anyway, don't worry, Pablo Escobar knows everything.
- I still have 20 hours!

I still have 20 hours, right?
If I can't deliver the merchandise, I'll call your boss myself.
Let's go.
- Are you coming?

Come on.
Stay here with the Colombians until we come back.
- Prepare the airplanes.

[GÃ¼ero] Hey...
What about your dad?
- He'll have to wait.

Hurry up!

SONORA, MEXICO HEAD OF THE JUDICIAL POLICE'S HOUSE [water running]
[woman screaming] [men yelling]
[door opens]
It's your choice, Director.
Do you want today to be your funeral?
- Don't hurt my family.

We won't hurt your family.
We just want the merchandise back.
The merchandise!
And who was the snitch?
REGARDS, EL CHAPO.
This is the warehouse in the US where the tunnel leads.
- Are you sure it's finished?

See you on the other side, GÃ¼ero.
[GÃ¼ero] See you, Chapo.
[steps approaching]
[steps moving away]
Mr. Secretary.
"EL CIELO" ESTATE
[Chapo] What's up, Pollo?

How's Dad?
Well... you know...
Your dad is waiting for you.
What's holding you up?
NEAR TECATE, MEXICO MEXICO

Right now, I can't, Mom.
If I could, I would be there.
Hurry up.
You need to say what you have stuck in your hearts.
As soon as I can, I'll go, I swear.
[sighs]
We're ready, Joaquín!
[opening truck door] [train passing]
Rayo, do you copy me?
What's up, buddy?
[Chapo] We're being followed.
It's the DEA!
Don't worry, the drugs are secure.
They aren't after that, they're coming after us!
Speed up!
Closer!
Rayo!

[Chapo] Rayo!
[honking] [in English] Go!
Closer!

[in English] Faster, man!
[DEA agent in Spanish] Don't move!
[Chapo] What's up, Peter?
DEADLINE FOR DELIVERY
[Chapo] You're getting into trouble, man.
An American cannot arrest people in Mexico.
And you shouldn't kill a DEA agent, but you did it.
Camarena's murder was Caro Quintero's doing.
And he's in prison.
Why do we have to get into trouble because of it?
The only one in trouble here is you, Chapo.
I've got strict orders.
Go teach them who's in charge so that they won't forget it.
The one with bad memory here is you.
You're no longer interested in securing your future?
You said so yourself.
Your retirement pension wasn't even enough to pay for your whores.
Don't worry about me.
We get a bonus for each drug lord that we capture.
A ten million dollar bonus?
Ten million?
All yours.
And five extra for your guys.
Ten million.
All you have to do... is forget about me.
[truck engine turns over]
TECATE, USA
[man] Come on, guys!
- [Chapo] Everything ready?

[man] Hurry up!

Pass me the packages.
Rayo!
[Chapo] The packages!

[truck door closes]

[man] This is heavy...
[Chapo] Give me that, man!
Come on, quickly.
[Chapo] Come on, faster.

How many are left?
Come on!

We're almost done!

[panting] Let's see...
USA

Are you there, GÃ¼ero?
[grunting] [grunting]
[laughing]
What's up, buddy?
Great!
Okay, let's go up!

- [Chapo] Come on, guys!

[panting]
[GÃ¼ero] Quickly!
[Chapo] Come on, man!
[Chapo] Hurry up!

Three hours left, Chapo.
Come on, GÃ¼ero.
WAREHOUSE IN LOS ANGELES, USA
Delivery completed, son of a bitch.
[activating watch]
Done, Chapo.
The boss will be impressed with your work.
[truck door opens]
Don Cheto.
I need to go to the airport.
- I'll take your car.

GÃ¼ero.
Kill all the workers who built the tunnel.
Everyone, except for the engineer.
No one can know where it is.
Good luck with your dad.
PRESIDENTIAL PALACE MEXICO CITY

- Good afternoon.

Pollo!

[Chapo's mother] ...in sickness and in health...
Guide me, Lord.
None of my enemies will...
The Lord is my shepherd;
I shall not want.
[sighs]
[musical instruments playing]
[echo of musical instruments playing]
[birds chirping]
[Chapo's mother] You couldn't make it on time.
I'm sorry, Mom.

Why do you think?

What did he want to tell me?
Did he tell you?
It doesn't matter.
Stop thinking about it.
He only wanted to tell you that... for him you're still just a damn servant.
One more scrub working for a drug lord.
And that you'll never be the greatest drug lord ever.
