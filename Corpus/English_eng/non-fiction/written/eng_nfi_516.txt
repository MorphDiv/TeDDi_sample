Jerome:

Female voice:

She's enjoying it.
Oh, yes.

My God, she's got a fantastic ass.
What, nicer than that lovely redhead's?
Now he's pushing her down on the bed.
- Ah, yes.

Ah... all gone.
[gasping]
What's the matter?

Dear Dick... _
I used to press my crotch into the belly of my stuffed rhino in the family room of our duplex in Cleveland, Ohio.
I loved to hump him in front of our sitter Karen Harris.
I used to say that Rhino was hungry and that I needed to feed him.
Then Karen went away to college, and I didn't feel like doing it anymore.
Then I found Jesus.
I was the only Jew at St. Cletus Elementary School.
I fell in love with Jesus because he looked like a hot 1970s yogi with his man bun, his loincloth.
I used to picture Him climbing off of His crucifix, walking into my room to say hi with His tears of blood.
In high school I wanted to fuck anybody, male or female.
Nobody took me up on it.
I had severe cystic acne, and I wore an enormous, vintage, smelly motorcycle jacket.
And I chain-smoked.
[boy, girl grunting]
In college I found a taker:
Noah Nussbaum.
Finally, someone I desired desiring me back was within the realm of possibility.
After we were done,
I wanted to know all the parts of me that he found beautiful.
He said, "Your lips, your eyes, your hair."
As he listed off these parts of me, my mind began to wander to those parts that remained unmentioned:
my nose, my bush, my tits.
After college, my best friend Liza and I wanted to fuck a rock star.
We finally caught one.
He took us back to his room at the Chelsea Hotel.
We told him we wanted to fuck him as if we were one person:
her body, my mind, a living representation of the Louise Bourgeois sculpture "The Couple".
This is Louise Bourgeois.
We wanted to act out the Cyborgian split projected onto every woman in this culture.
You're weird.
Weird girls.
Ten years later, I met Sylvere.
He was the first man I was with who didn't resent me for being smart.
Hey, I'm here.
Sylvere:

I'm in the bedroom.

Maybe it was because he had just published a book and everybody thought he was going to be famous, or maybe because he was so much older than me.
We would meet up once a week to have sex.
I knew he was fucking other people, but I was too obsessed with him to care.
- All right, come on in.

Take off your clothes and touch yourself.
No.
Boots on.
He said what got him off most was watching me get off.
Nothing freaked him out.
Smile at me.
Now don't smile.
After he watched me get off, we would eat clam soup and talk about philosophy.
He was one of the smartest people I'd ever met.
I mean, if you were ambidextrous...
And I loved seeing myself through his eyes.
A year after we met,
I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, and I figured that that was the end of us.
Have some of this.
But instead, he said that we should get married so I could be on his insurance plan.
A year after that, we stopped having kinky sex.
And five years after that, we stopped having sex at all.
Forgot what lust felt like... until I met you.
I don't care how you see me.
I don't care if you want me.
It's better that you don't.
It's enough that I want you.
Sometimes, when I walk down the street,
I look into the faces of every woman I pass, and I wonder what she sees.
I wonder about the history of her desires.
Dear Dick... _

Devon:

The way you moved... captivated me.
You swaggered.
You took your time like you knew the whole world would wait for you.
Hey.

I asked my parents for a pair of boots just like yours, and they got them for me.
We all pretended we were friends, even though my grandparents had all worked on your land, just like their parents had.
♪♪ [continues]
I loved watching you play cowboy with all your women.
Watching you, I knew I wanted to grow up to be like you.
The hand, not the waist.
When my girl cousins told me to act like a boy so that they could practice kissing,
I pretended I was you.
I had girlfriends from an early age.
I was good at romantic gestures.
I wrote poems that made girls cry.
Why are you doing this to me?
Shh.
Hey, Mom, I'm home.
Hey, there, cariño.
Mom, what's Dick doing here?
I was just talking to him about the ranch, Dolores.
Shut the hell up.

We don't talk like that in this house.
It's not ladylike.
I'm not a lady!
I was the first member of the Buendia family to go to college.
I was going to study playwriting, but... then I met Shirin.
I was in love for the first time in my life.
I couldn't even go to class.
Shirin would practice the cello every day for hours.
♪♪
[exhale]
[no audible dialogue]
I called my abuela to tell her that I'd met someone new.
By this point, everybody in my family knew what that meant.
She told me, "Mija, it's better if that person loves you just a little bit more than you love them."
Hmm.
Shirin never told her family about anything at all.
Then one day I bumped into her at a restaurant having lunch with a boy.

- Fucking weird.

I'm not being crazy.

We fought for days and days.
...you coming up to me in the middle of...
Then one morning she left me, and she told people we'd never been together at all.
I flunked out of school.
I came back to Texas... to figure out who the hell I should become.
I wrote this edition with a new one:
Books and Pictures.
This was to vent and focus my anger, but I was saved.

We will be seen, and we will be heard.
Dear Dick... _
I learned everything I could about him.
He was born on June 9, 1961, in Alberta.
He was a child actor in Canada before he came to the States.
He married his "Family Ties" costar Tracy Pollan on July 16, 1988.
His middle initial was actually A, but he didn't like the sound of "Michael A. Fox."
Why did I love him so much?
Partly, I think, I was in love with his alter ego Alex P. Keaton.
It's kind of messed up, but something about the idea of a political conservative...
I found that really, really sexy.
Maybe because my other great love was my mother.
She was a feminist.
She and her friends wanted to change the world.
They were trying to get Geraldine Ferraro elected as the first woman vice-president.

I loved every part of her:
her ears, her neck, and most of all her hands.
They were so soft and warm and smooshy.
I used to beg her to chop off one of her hands and give it to me so I could have it all for myself.
I followed her everywhere.
I liked to watch her do her nighttime things... put on lotion, floss... while she told me about her day.
Then one night, I noticed something:
her tampon string.
♪ There's a voice from the past ♪
Something in me turned against her.
I stopped following her around.
I started hiding.
Hey.

Good night.
I turned a closet into my reading nook.
I would get under this soft blanket my grandmother had knitted for me and read my Edward Eagar books and just kind of let my hand go wherever it wanted.
Reading meant touching myself, and touching myself was something I did when I was reading.
I didn't have a word for it.
I didn't know it was this thing or something that you weren't supposed to talk about.
All I knew was it felt good.
The day I first learned what masturbation actually was,
I didn't want to do it anymore.
Naming it was literally the least sexy thing I could imagine.
That's why I love your work so much, Dick.
You refuse to give anything a name.
So you call it Untitled.
No, I don't call it anything.
When I first saw your work, Dick, the word "art" seemed so inadequate.
This was something much more ancient and unnamable.
Beauty is one thing.
Your work was sublime.
It evoked in me a feeling of boundlessness.
It was fucking terrifying.
When you invited me to come curate with you...
I was ready to dive into that feeling.
I would love to open the new space with a Mickaline Thomas show.
I only like her early stuff.
How about a Doris Salcedo retrospective?
Young Jean Lee's untitled feminist show.
I'm still here, searching for something you'll say yes to.
Dear Dick... or should I say... _
_
Shall we go over your many awards and accomplishments?
You've made a career moving boulders, cutting trenches in the desert, making art that reminds us of how precious Mother Earth and her sacred resources are, while also reminding us of the size of your massive steel-and-concrete cock.
Your pieces cost millions of dollars to make.
You employ hundreds of men per project.
You embody everything anyone has ever wanted from a late 20th century alpha male artist and scholar.
You are a remote, mysterious, unknowable cowboy.
Art historians worship you.
I know all this because we had one of your books when I was a kid.
This was our living room.
These were our coffee table books.
My favorite was the one about you.
This was the house I grew up in in Santa Fe.
This was my favorite doll.
Her name was Stupid.
Doesn't she look stupid?
This is me and my dad.
He was an expert on children, so he thought he was allowed to touch me.
This is my mom.
And this is the woman he left my mom for.
This is the first time I watched pornography.
Check... this out.
My cousin Tara was visiting.
Ohh!

I couldn't get it out of my head.
Oh, yeah.

[laughing]
Fuck.

Ohh.
[laughing continues]
Dear Dick, I know you went to Columbia at 15 and I went to Columbia at 16, but it's a lot less common for people to do that these days.
I was an art history major, and I saw a lot of naked women in my survey classes.
There are 500 times as many female nudes in art history textbooks, Dick, as there are female artists.
In my Early Modernism class, we studied 19th century diagrams of the ideal breast shape.
And the thought of that porn still stuck in my head inspired my research presentation at the end of the semester
"The Morphology of the Breast in Online Pornography."
Then I turned my attention to hardcore porn.
I refused to discuss its politics.
I studied its shapes, the colors, the forms, composition.
For my undergraduate thesis,
I wrote about what happens to a woman's face when she sucks two cocks at the same time.
For my Ph.D. I wrote about gaping.
Gaping, in case you don't know, is when a group of men fuck a woman in the asshole and then tape it open to see how wide it's gotten from all the fucking.
Sometimes they measure it.
I studied all the different iterations of this gaping hole.
My professors had some questions.
Have you thought about switching to gender studies?
I'm an art historian.
I have no interest in gender studies.
Why would you ask me that?
In the past three years,
I've gotten two postgraduate fellowships, an Outstanding Dissertation Award, and a Guggenheim.
I may be nowhere near you, but I am definitely heading closer.
Dear Dick, when I first read about you, I was confused.
Who was this rich, famous person who got to make whatever he wanted in the desert?
Did he not know how much I had suffered?
What I mean to say is we should be able to study beauty, too.
We shouldn't have to be gender studies majors.
You've got 30 years on me, Dick, but you haven't made a piece in nearly a decade.
Your time is running out.
Dear Dick... _
