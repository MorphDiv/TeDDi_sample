Come on, this way.
(explosions and gunfire outside)
Clear the room.
- All clear, nobody's here.

It sounds like it got quiet out there.
- Yeah.

Shit!

FRANK:

Speak up... we will shoot.
Wait, hold your fire, Frank!

Hey, boy.
Is that water for us?
(gunfire)
Jesus Christ, Frank, you just killed a kid!
- Eh.

Jesus Christ!
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna give him CPR.
Now, is he blowing someone?

- Yeah, looks like it.

Frank, he was just trying to give us water, man!
Forget it, he's dead.
MAC:

Think about his mom and his dad.
How long they been playing this for?
Oh, dude... three straight days.
They've been playing this
- for three days?

Jesus Christ, have they slept?
No.

- Frank, behind you!

I mean, as a world?

Hey, uh, have any of you seen my guy yet?
Oh, what is this, now?
- What?

- What do you want to tell us?

- Oh, you're dating a stripper.

Wow, gross.
Gross?

A what... a charming taint man?
What words is she trying to say?
- Uh, she's talking about Channing Tatum.

- He's an actor.

- Well, he-he plays G.I. Joe.

- G.I...

- Well, then say G.I. Joe, don't make up a name.

- Makes me want to throw up.

- Just what happened.

Oh, right, you jacked his wallet or something so he'd come over and you-you...
- Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Hello.

Hey.

- Yeah.

- Oh...

Listen, um, I'm really glad you called, though.
I really wanted to thank you for last night.
Thank you for last night.
Yeah.

- Yeah.

"What's become of me?"
You know, all I do is I strip all night, I play video games all day, I have meaningless sex with strangers.
My own daughter won't even talk to me, you know?

And I realized I hit rock bottom.
Oh.
And that's why I was crying.
Oh.

- Yeah.

No.

- All right, cool.

- Yeah, cool.

- Oh...

You're welcome.
Um...

Dee.
Dee?
- Yeah.

Now, can I get that watch, or...
- Hey, Dee, I think he just wants his watch.

- Yeah, I understand.

CHARLIE:

Rock bottom?

Maybe that was your rock bottom, okay?
I'm not rock bottom.
You know what I am?

Dee is a rock.

- who makes men's lives better.

Hey-o!

(clicks tongue)
Well, that...

That's not a good example.
No, I got...

I am gonna fix this problem, 'cause I'm gonna tell you something right now:
Sweet Dee is a rock.
Goddamn it, Frank, you shot a woman.
- FRANK:

- I got to stop.

I got to take a break, dude.
It's driving me insane.
Come on, how are we gonna win if you keep quitting?
I don't care!
- Lot of storm-outs today, huh?

- Yeah.

Dee can't handle a little rejection.
- (scoffs)

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

- that's not trauma.

- that bad.

- who have experienced real trauma.

- I think it is.

Uh, me?
Well, yeah.

I mean, you grew up fatherless.
You were raised by a woman who was basically a prostitute.
Well, the father stuff was real.
Yeah, without a doubt.
Got some daddy issues there.
And-and you, too.

- Ah.

- That's trauma.

Why do you guys br... no.

- It was.

- She's an older woman, you were a younger...

A woman can't rape a guy.
- An older woman can rape a younger...

- Doesn't matter.

- This is separate, yeah.

It's not the point.

You'll do what?
I'll strip.

Huh.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Huh.

You know, frankly, I'm a little disappointed in myself for not thinking of it before.
You know?

Right, yeah.
Here's the thing, man.

I need you to get my back.
Oh, uh, you want me to strip with you?
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I-I-I... no, I just literally need you to have a look at my back, you know, make sure there's no moles or, like, unsightly hairs, bumps, zits, you know,
- that kind of thing.

And then, you know, get after it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll clean you up.
All right, all right, I can do that.
- Cool.

Yeah, I'll be the boy.
Well, just be my...

You know, carry around my-my lotions, my oils, my scents, my razors.
Cool, man.

Yeah, that's cool, right?
- Yeah, that's cool, bro.

No!

Mother!
Oh, shit!
Oh, no, man!
I'm so sorry, man.
Hey, son.
Dad?

How did you get in the game?
Guess we... won't be having that catch after all.
You were gonna have a catch with me?
I was, but... (coughs) you killed me, son.
(gasps)
I...

- (groans)

Wait!

Dad, who do you love?

Dad, who do you love?

(gasps loudly)

Oh, was that a dream?
Dennis?
Oh, my God, man, I just had the weirdest dream.

- What?

Look, I-I...

- Dead kids, dads.

Slow down.

I got to quit the game, dude.

- do this anymore.

Don't quit just yet.
- Look, have a drink and calm down.

(sighs) I'll calm down.

Yeah, stuff it down with brown.
That's the best way to deal with things.
(quietly):

Kid's a mess.
Goddamn it, Charlie, we're 30 minutes late, man.
I'm so sorry I cut your back so many times, man.
- What happened?

- Why?

- Thanks, man.

I'm working hard, dude.
Dude, you're putting the work in, and it's showing, man.
- Thank you so much, man.

But just let's not talk about it in there.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Can you walk me through what your guy is again?
Okay, so here's the deal, man.
Who do girls want to have sex with more than anybody else?
- Jugglers.

- Dudes who can, like, juggle things.

- You know, with the fire sticks and the balls.

No, they don't want to have sex with a juggler.
They want to have sex with their dads.
- Weird.

Oh.

- All right, that works.

Oh, you said I was gonna be your boy 'cause I have daddy trauma, and then, I didn't realize I was gonna be your boy in there, but that works great.
No, that doesn't make any sense.
How would you be my s...?
I'm their dad.

We can't all be related.

Yeah, I mean, you could have a lot of kids, I guess.
I got to say, though, I'm looking inside there, and this isn't making sense to me.
I mean, these are all older women.

- That's not a good play.

I'm getting a bad feeling about this, man.
Hey, man, do you think maybe that's 'cause
- of your librarian trauma?

- Yeah, she was an older woman, and...

Let's not talk...

- and-and-and cuts on the... on peoples' backs?

And let's...

- Okay, yeah, well, then let's split.

- All right, let's go.

Are you the stripper?
- Oh, uh, yeah, that's him.

- What, are you 40?

Fine.

Y-You guys?

- The what?

Well, you're not my boy.

Are you gonna stand out here and talk like little bitches, or are you gonna come inside and take your dicks out for money?
Daddy?
Just don't call me Daddy.
FRANK:

But since you softies like to talk about everything,
I figured this was a good thing to do.
A PTSD support group, Frank?
Yeah, yeah.

- we can finish the damn game.

What the hell are you doing here?
Well, because I am a rock and not a rock bottom, I decided to reach out to Mike and see if I could get him some help with, uh, some of these issues he's been having.
I'm confused.

Mm-hmm, yeah.

No.

Really?

- your characters off past experiences.

Okay, look, I-I'm not gonna pass myself off as a vet, Frank.
- Yeah, I don't feel good about this.

- But...

Okay, everybody, let's grab a chair, let's get this started.
- Probably not gonna call on you anyway.

Ugh.

Uh, I'm Frank.
I've been around the block, seen some action.
I was in 'Nam for a while.
Private sector mostly.
I did shoot a couple of dinks who tried to jack some sneakers off the factory floor.
No big deal.
I don't feel nothing about it.
I'm just here to support my buddy.
DEE (clears throat):

Hello.

I'm here with this guy.
There was a bit of a mix-up about his military credentials, but, uh... whatever.
Now he's under the delusion that he's hit rock bottom, you know, and I just don't see how that's possibly true, so, we're gonna straighten that up while we're sitting here today, you know.
Mac's being a pussy!
He doesn't want to fight anymore!
I'm not being a pussy.
I just don't want to kill women and children.
FRANK:

Mike's embarrassed about his dancing, and I just...

I don't...

You know?

Can you please explain Channing Tatum to him?
- I'm not sure I follow...

FRANK:

He's having erotic nightmares and shit.
- He doesn't know what's real anymore.

Mike's embarrassed about his video game-playing, which makes no sense to me, 'cause you know what?

- You ever play Fallujah?

- You want to play with me?

Well, what if he paid you?
Ten bucks an hour.
- 20.

- Wow.

Now we're getting somewhere, huh?
- Yeah.

Wait a second, Frank.

You're out.

MAN:

What is happening here?
Doesn't matter.

- Yeah, we're good.

(crickets chirping)
(loud snoring)
- Hey, son.

What are you doing here?
I broke out of jail and came straight to see you.
- Because you love me?

(muffled yelling):

(loudly gasping for air)
What...?

When did I get here?

You got here, like, five minutes ago.
You've been asleep for 35 seconds.
Oh, Jesus Christ, I'm-I'm losing my mind.
- I mean, I'm actually going insane.

- Yeah.

We're gonna win this war.
What war?
- The war on women!

There's a war on women?

- (phone ringing)

- Oh.

Phone!
- Hello.

Uh, yeah, is youse Daddy and the Boy?
- Uh, y-yes, it is.

Yeah.

Well, yeah, that-that is true.
Well, I've got a party for you.
- Um, Daddy wants to speak with you.

Yeah, this is Daddy.

Uh, yeah, a giant party.

Sorority girls.

Did you just lick your hand?

I'm a bad dad now.

Okay.

Yeah, we need Mike.

- Mike?

Of course I knew it was you.

The accents were terrible.
- The accents were terrible.

I want him to have fun, make a ton of money, party with a bunch of sorority girls, you know?
I need to show him that this is a great life.
This is not a rock-bottom life.
We'll do it at Paddy's.

- Make a ton of mon...

Yes.

What?

Goddamn it.
This is good.

Young girl sorority girls.

- Cougars.

And it's gonna be on our home turf.

- Whoa.

We'll be like an elite stripping dance force, like a unit, man.
Dude, dude, dude, dude,
- we're gonna look good, man.

We're gonna win this war.
- Oh, hell yeah.

You know what, Mac, maybe we could use you after all.
- He's asleep.

- (snarling) - (gunfire)

Right now, if we can just make it to that second box over there, we can grab the all spark coin and we can win the game.

Oh, Mac.

I think I got PTSD, too.
- Oh, no.

Yeah, I actually slept about ten hours last night, dude, and I feel great.
I think we were just suffering from sleep deprivation.
Well, where's Mike?

Oh, we finished the game.

- Dude, it was awesome.

No, I don't want to play anymore.
Well, where's Mike?

He's out, too.

I only woke you up 'cause I figured you'd want to see it.
- Yeah?

I really appreciate you getting me this gig.

I don't think I was ready to give this lifestyle up.
Of course not.

Listen, you like video games?

You're a great stripper?

- And you know what I'm gonna do for you next?

I'm gonna reunite you with your daughter.

Look, I really appreciate everything you've done.
- It really, really means a lot to me.

Fire it up.

- Look good?

- And you can't see any of the blood.

It's all patched up good.

Cheese.
