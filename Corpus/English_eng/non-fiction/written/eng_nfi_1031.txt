(Salaam speaking Arabic)
(Chuckles)
(In English) It's been an hour, Raymond.
Your men coming or not?
As I said, there's been a slight delay at the border.
Yes, you said that.
(Salaam speaking Arabic)
Salaam seems grouchy.

God knows I'm starving.
What the hell are we doing standing around in this warehouse?
Let's get a meal, break bread, drink some arak.
When the shipment gets here, we'll finish our business.
The truck isn't coming, is it?
What's that supposed to mean?
(Laughs)
Oh, I've heard the rumours, Raymond.

People are whispering.

(Salaam speaking Arabic)
(In English) They're saying bills are not being paid.
Yeah.

People are talking, Raymond.

(Speaking Arabic)
(In English) Salaam has men in the field waiting for arms.
If they're not supplied as promised, they'll die.
The truck will be here.
(Speaking Arabic)
(Speaks Arabic)
Rhinehart, assure your client
as much as I detest him and his dirty little war, his shipment is en route and will get here when it gets here.
However, if he expects to take delivery, he needs to put his gun back in his pants.
If that truck doesn't show, we're all dead.

We are dead.
Tell him to put the gun down.
And what do you know...
I got here as soon as I could.
But the situation at the border is the least of our problems.
What happened?

They sent a man to say your funds never arrived.
There was a lot of yelling.
Then he said, "the Beck family is done doing business
"with Mr. Reddington."
Then he left.
(Yelling in Arabic)
Indeed the rats are fleeing, Dembe.
If the payment wasn't made, it's because Kaplan is making a run on the bank.
Get Abe on the phone.

Reddington:

Things are nowhere near as bad as you've been led to believe.
No.

Which is fine.

Abe:

We sent them already 24 hours ago.
She said anything?
Call brimley.
What?
Yes, of course, I'm confirming that as we speak.
What the hell is going on with bank rheinfelden?
Manager:

For what it's worth, I can assure you there have been no security breaches on our end.
In the event Mr. Reddington would reconsider...
He won't reconsider.

Yes... yes, Von Hauser is gone, which is unfortunate, but indicative of nothing.
I can assure you the passage is safe and the documents are clean.
I've got rice on the line.

Your only risk is if you step out now and your clients end up with inferior material.
Or worse yet, end up in custody.
Fine.
He hung up.
Well, what did he say?
Cancel the order.
It appears the Frankfurt and bagan accounts are both gone.
I thought Kaplan was removed from the account.
She must be trading on your trust, saying she still represents you.
Oh, it's exhilarating.
I can actually feel my body releasing endorphins.
You were on the treadmill for 15 minutes, walking.
Race-walking.

It's an olympic sport.

See, this is why you're so good for me.
I never exercise this much.

It's like a total stress reducer.
Aram Mojtabai?
Um...
Uh, yeah?
You've been subpoenaed to appear in front of a federal grand jury.
Tomorrow.

Is this about the task force?

It's illegal to tell a target of an investigation that you've been called to testify.
So keep it to yourself.
Brimley:

Brimley.

Here.

Two rabbits.

There is a woman in the other room.
I need you to get her to divulge the name and the address of Kaplan's new driver.
I'm skipping euchre with the saltmans to tell you this face-to-face.

Please, we can discuss that later.
I'm with you, what, 19 years?
There's talk of bodies turning up.
An investigation.
I wanna help, but you're hotter than a four-peckered Billy goat, and I can't risk doing another stretch.
Not even for you.
I need you, Teddy.
Betsy's the best I can do for you.
You know what my time at lompoc did.
No dust mite covers.

I barely made it, and that was before the hypoxemia.
Whatever you need her to say, Betsy'll squeeze it out of her.
And then it's rabbit stew for dinner.
Not stewed.

She likes a little tickle in her throat.
Abe:

Whatever this is, I don't wanna know.
The accounts.
I've gone over each one.

She's cleaning you out.
That's brutal.
Yeah, the me says the decapitation occurred post-mortem.
Why do you think, Reddington would do something like that?
Well, maybe he gave it to someone as proof, you know.
A warning to an enemy.
See, I'm thinking he gave it to a friend.
As a gift.
Like an offering.
Gale:

From Mr. Reddington.
Ressler:

Oh, yeah.
I ID'd the body, and I was able to ID the friend.
Ressler:

Gale:

He's standing right in front of me.
This is mako tanida.
He killed some of the bureau's best men and women.
And then Reddington goes and kills him.
Why would Reddington do that?
In exchange for your protection.
I followed you to the woods.
I saw you and Keen with Reddington.
I was wrong.
Keen wasn't informing Reddington.
Reddington was informing you.
The bureau.
After everything we did to try and hunt down Reddington, after everything that Reddington did...
America's most wanted man.
You cut a deal with him.

No, Julian.

Main justice did.
And when I found out, what you're feeling right now, that's exactly how I felt.
So then what?
Reddington cuts tanida's head off and you think, "whoa,
"not so bad having an assassin on the payroll."
No.

You know the good we do.
Are you trying to justify this to...

In four years, we've made more high-level arrests than every other division combined.

Reddington's a mass murderer.
If I can prove that you or anybody else on the task force turned a blind eye when he killed any of these people,
I'm gonna take you down.

I'm gonna take everybody down.
Is that a threat?
It's a promise.
Reddington:

How are you?
I miss alonissos.
No money, a shack on the beach, dreams of infamy.
That was a lifetime ago.

Two maybe.
You said you had a question.
If so, I must ask you to be brief about it.
don Julio, I've never known you to be brusque.
Certainly not at mealtime.
I hear things, Raymond.
And what I hear is that your associate Mr. Kaplan is proving to be a formidable adversary.
I have a name.
Squeezed it out of a contractor in Kaplan's employ.
Phillip Roque.
I understand he used to be your driver.
If I get to him, I get to Kaplan.
Can't help you.
Can't or won't?
It seems this Mr. Kaplan pays well.
I'm told that Roque recently bought a Porsche.
That's all you know?

That's all you need.
Send my love to chitra.
Stainless steel.

You got your large and medium kitchen, your boning, your fruit, your paring, and your bread.
End of the month, guy with the most sales takes home the set.
Incentive.
The currency of politicians, dog trainers, and criminals.
We're in a meeting here.

I'm Raymond Reddington.

Phillip Roque.
In the last four weeks, he purchased an automobile from one of you fine gentlemen.
Tricked out with all the bells and whistles.
Anyone?
No?
Perhaps an incentive.
You get to keep all your fingers and toes.
Phillip Roque.
No address or number.
Everything ran through a business manager.
And who was that exactly?
Hello, Abe.
(Screams)
You won't be using that arm again.
But it's your left arm, and I know you're right-handed.
I know that because we've worked together for 11 years.
I know your wife has diabetes.
That your daughter's favourite animal is a hippo.
I know you love Chinese food.
That you eat it every Wednesday when you shack up with your girlfriend in her apartment
above Wufat noodle house.
I know you skim an extra grand every week to help pay for that girlfriend.
Abe, you steal my money so you can get laid, which I've ignored because you're an accounting wizard.
What I cannot ignore is your betrayal.
You are how Mr. Kaplan has drained my accounts.
Red, I can explain.

You wired money to buy him a car.

(Grunts)
Page 12.
"Mario Dixon."
I can't help with Roque.
I would if I knew where he was, but I don't.
Who's Mario Dixon?
No!

We have a new target.
Elizabeth.
I need you to find out what you can about a Mario Dixon.
Kaplan wired him $300,000 two days ago.
Whatever her next move is, Dixon is helping her make it.
Grabbing lunch at sol's.

Tuna salad on rye.
Extra pickles.
(Tires screech)
(Car lock chirps)
Mr. Kaplan:

Who are you?

The good news is, you're going to live.
The bad news is, your depth perception will never be the same.
There must be some mistake.
Look, I don't...

Which is your dominant eye?
Drucker:

Did I have a choice?
Victims of Raymond Reddington were recently unearthed and turned over to the FBI.
Based on the resulting investigation,
I've convened a grand jury to hear testimony about whether the task force you are a part of enabled Raymond Reddington to continue committing crimes while working as a bureau informant.
Yeah.

And whether members of that task force ignored or facilitated those crimes in exchange for information
Reddington provided in pursuit of high-level targets.
If you insist on calling my client before the grand jury, he will invoke his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination.
I'm granting him immunity.

To testify against my friends.
Who may or may not work for a task force that may or may not even exist.
Yeah.

I don't have to do that, right?
Granting you immunity in exchange for your testimony takes away your right to plead the fifth.
How can they do that?
Take away my constitutional right by granting me something that I don't want?
I don't want immunity.

I refuse to let you Grant it.
Consider me un-granted.
Counsellor, I trust you will help your client to understand the gift he has been given.
Gift?

My alleged friends.
To stay out of prison.
Unless you refuse to answer my questions, in which case you could go to jail for being in contempt.
Look, Gale...

He saw me with Keen and Reddington.
Yeah, but is that so terrible?
I mean, it's not good, but, uh, the task force is legal.
He can't get a grand jury to indict us for working on it.
Who said anything about a grand jury?
Gale's angle is Reddington.
And what we've let him do in exchange for cases.
It's a slippery moral slope we have navigated with care.
As we'd do with any CI.
But our CI is responsible for 86 homicides in America.
Ressler:

He has a timeline.
He knows we've let Reddington get away with murder.
Yeah, but he can't prove it.
Not unless one of us testifies that it's true.
Which none of us would ever do.
Unless he can prove the existence of a deal, he has nothing.
Aram:

He will not, whatever...

I'm proud of the work that we've done here.
Proud of facilitating a criminal empire.
A necessary evil.

But if we're being honest, some of the blood he's spilt is on our hands.
Liz:

And with Aram.
I'm proud and I'm ashamed.
And one day, when they teach a course on Reddington's task force at Quantico, we can do a panel and debate the pros and cons, but right now we need to get Kate Kaplan.
Kaplan?
I think you missed the part about Julian Gale.
He's steps away from indicting us.
The closer Gale gets, the faster we need to remove Kaplan as a threat to Reddington.
How are the two connected?
Because we need Reddington to deal with Gale.
Are you suggesting killing him?
Liz:

I'm not suggesting anything other than what we already know to be true.
Which is that if we wanna get out from Gale's shadow, we're gonna need Reddington's help.
And if we don't stop Kaplan now, he won't be around to give it to us.
Fine.

Samar:

Put it on ice.
Liz:

Mario Brandon Dixon is a thief who specialises in high value targets.
Jewels, art, cars, nuts...
Nuts?

When stolen by truckload, they're actually quite lucrative.
It's a fun fact.
Cooper:

He has a kid brother in prison.

Why are you doing this?
I told you, we're gonna need...
Reddington hired The Debt Collector to kidnap you.
Which is indefensible.
He allowed you to be drugged by a deranged sociopath.
He did.
And if he's in trouble, then so are we.
I'm convinced we either rise together or fall apart.
Navabi, you and Keen get to mecklenburg.
See what the brother has to say.
Okay, if you're here about Mario...
Liz:

What you threw away for him.
You graduated high school with 3.8 GPA and a soccer scholarship to Clemson.
Mario saw the life you wanted and he dragged you into his.
Into this.
Believe me, I know what it's like to have a criminal brother you love.
It's been a rough haul, hasn't it?
If you're not in the shu, you're in the infirmary.
Samar:

If the information you provide leads us to your brother, we're authorised to slice five years off your sentence.
Deal.
But before you interrupted me,
I was gonna rat out the prick for nothing.
He's got a place in Baltimore where he keeps his Booty.
Checks in on it regularly.
(Cell phone rings)
Dembe:

What do you know?
Mario Dixon works out of
some high-end, hipster boutique in Hampden.
We'reworking ona warrantnow.
A warrant won't be necessary, just the address.
(Laughs) My land.
Look at this, Dembe.

Do we have any need for a saddle?
Wouldn't it go great with the chaps and the spurs?
Look at that Crescent wrench.

What a handy little store.
Perhaps this is the wrong place.
Can I help you fellas find something?
(Chuckles) Look at you.
What might this old thing be worth?
Perhaps a trip to the back room?

Now, this is more like it.
Where might we find Mr. Dixon?
I don't know.
Honestly.

You ever have one of those days when nothing goes right?
People give you the runaround,
everything seems to take twice the effort.
The kind of day that you'd kill to get your mojo back.
I'm having one of those days.
So...
You can either be honest with me about Mario Dixon, or I can get behind the wheel of this fine automobile and run you over.
He's in Philly.
Ona job.
Pickingupapackage froma client.
You're clear on the document and its location?
Dixon:

Key's inside?

Please get the document.

It's okay.
They're gone.
(Door buzzes)
Afternoon, Mr. gorrell.
(Groans)
(Screams)
Georgie.

Is it true?

Yeah.

How great is that?
It's great if he talks.
Let's hope he's not the strong silent type.
Georgie, what's that?
Lunch.

Homemade tuna salad.
She seems like a real sweet lady.
Reddington:

Why on earth would she do this?
Gorrell:

My eye... (Grunts)
Why did she take your eye?
There's a scanner at work.
She needs my eye for access.
To what?

(Groans) The Stone Canyon storage facility.
I don't know what that is.

What's stored there?

Their secrets.

Sir, ID and requisition, please.
(Cell phone rings)
Who is this?
Mr. Kaplan:

Whereareyouonthecase,  agentGale?
You know I can't tell you that.
Haveyoupresented yourfindings tomainjustice?
How do I know you are who you say you are?
Eighty-six bodies, 62 gunshots, eleven stabbings, nine blunt force traumas.
Four were poisoned.

A grand jury's been convened.
Without proof of a connection
between Reddington and the task force, they'llneverhandup anindictment.
Thebodiesjust don'tgiveme that.

ButI can.
There.

FBI!

Liz:

That's a dead end.
Liz:

Okay.

Could you narrow that down a little?

We got support units from the bureau, atf, ice, andDEAscramblingrightnow.
That's... great.

They insisted.
(Engine revving)
(Tires screech)
(Man shouts indistinctly)
(Indistinct chatter on radio)
(Sirens wail)
You agent Keen?

Has anyone opened it yet?

On orders from director Harold Cooper himself.
Thank you.
Samar:

It's Reddington's signed immunity deal
with the department of justice.
Dixon: (Chuckles) Let me get this straight.
You think I'm going to jail?
You two are smarter than that.
Liz:

You stole a classified document from a government facility you shouldn't have even known existed.
You won't charge me.

Oh, I guarantee it.
See, I know what I stole back there.
Proof of an immunity agreement between the FBI and Raymond Reddington.
You want some advice, Mario?

Stop?
No, no.

So, you charge me,
I have a constitutional right to present a defence.
And I promise you, that immunity deal will be exhibit a.
Liz:

We're not charging you, but we're not exactly letting you go either.
Meaning what?

With all due respect, you two don't seem the type.
Reddington.
I'll leave you two to talk.
Sit.
Dixon:

You got the FBI on your payroll?
They deliver me right to you, no questions asked.
I was thinking about that poor soul whose eye you stole.
What a shame.
Disfigured for life.

Wasn't my decision.
Take it up with the lady who hired me.
Mr. Kaplan.

Are you nuts?
I know about your immunity deal.
That means I'm dead no matter what I tell you.
Ratting Kaplan out gets me nothing.
She had you steal that agreement.
Must've had a plan to bring it to her.
You can tell me where and when, or you can tell him.
One way or another, the truth will out.
We don't know each other, so I'll forgive you for not knowing that I don't scare easily.
I expect to die here today.
That's the end of your leverage.
But...

Please, do go on.
If you want to negotiate, I might be willing to help.
I can deliver her to you.
In exchange for what?
(Cell phone rings)
Dixon:

Any problems?
Nothing unexpected.
But anyone holding this thing is a target.
I don't want to keep it any longer than I have to.
I can meet you later today.
We're all set.
I'll serve her up on a silver platter if you hold up your end of the deal.
Liz:

You know what, don't tell me.
I honestly don't want to know.

But he told you how to find Kaplan?
Yes.

She'll be there personally to take possession of the agreement.
5:00 doesn't give us much time.
Thenyou'lljusthave tohurry,Elizabeth.
I'll be in touch as soon as I know more.
Wait, what about Dixon?

They'llhavetime beforethemeet.
I'msorry, Ihaveto go .

Reddington, there's something's wrong.
I can hear it in your voice.
Whereareyougoing?

5:00.

Dembe:

Perhaps.
Your purpose is to protect Elizabeth, but mine is to protect you.
If things get very bad, this will make that impossible.
Hello, dom.
What do you want?
You told me never to open this.
Yes.

I'm old, but I'm not that old.
You said this was for emergency only.
The last resort.
If you open this, it would mean...

What is it, Raymond?

I'm under attack, dom.
Most of my business has been destroyed.
Many of my people killed.

Then fight back.
That's what you do with that.

I'm trying, but regardless, this isn't for me.
I don't understand.

Why would you do that?
(Grunts)
(Sighs)
For Masha.
She's alive, dom.
I thought we lost her once.

Unbelievable.

You're gonna give yourself a heart attack.
Like you care.
Like you're even capable of considering anyone else's feelings but your own.
That's not fair.
Masha's alive.

How long have you known this?

You let me sit here thinking that she was...
You told me she was dead.

I wasn't lying.
When I told you Masha was gone,
I believed she had died in childbirth.
She deceived me, faked her own death.
At the time, she wanted to get away from me.
(Scoffs) So do I.
She had help from one of my people.
A woman close to me who betrayed my trust.
Dom, I know you've been conditioned to assume my selfishness.
I'm sure that's largely my fault.
But this is different.
This woman, she's made it her mission to eliminate me, to remove me from Masha's life.
Whatever the cost.
The truth is, she's proven to be remarkably adept
at killing the people closest to me.
She knows everything about my operation.
I kept her at my side for years, but the one thing she doesn't know is you.
I haven't told you about Masha because I didn't want to risk coming here or making contact with you again until this fight was over.
So now I'm supposed to say thank you?
You don't have to say anything.
You don't have to believe me, or help me, or like me.
You never have, I don't know why you'd have to start now.
But this isn't about me, dom.
This is about Masha.
If I don't come back...

If I don't come back,
you need to find her, dom.
Tell her who you are.
(Door opens)
Dembe:

I have to go.
I'm sorry.
For what?

I wish I'd been the person you wanted me to be.
Mr. Cooper, can I talk to you for a second?
Not now.
Tactical teams in place?

Where's our asset?

I'll call him.
(Cell phone rings)
Elizabeth.

You'resupposedto be here withDixon.
Our meeting with Kaplan's in less than an hour.
I'llbetaking thatmeetingalone.
You lied about the location.
You're gonna kill her.
Idon'tknow whattheoutcomewillbe.
I asked you not to do this.
You asked if I could promise you that I wouldn't.
I said no.
That was Dembe.
He said he can't find Reddington.
What do you mean he can't find him?
If we don't show up with Dixon, our whole operation's blown.
Where the hell is he?
Where did Kaplan tell you to meet?
Where's what you promised me?
A box?
I'm supposed to believe that my escape plan and my future survival fits into a box?
This is no mere box.
Inside you'll find travel vouchers, security codes, boat keys, and ownership papers for a private 96-acre island off the coast of Brunei.
It's a self-sufficient turnkey property with a desalination well,
a solar and wind farm, a full-time wait staff, grounds crew, security team, and a property manager.
All paid for in perpetuity by a very healthy trust fund.
Paradise with no extradition treaty.
And what's to prevent you from kicking me off this island once I move in?
Right now, the island's owner is legend.
Nobody on the island knows who it belongs to.
All they know is that one day, someone will arrive with a key that fits into an old lock in the front door.
Whosoever opens that lock with this key, the staff will loyally serve and the guards will forever defend against all comers.
The location of the meeting.
Falstaff theatre on m street.

Kaplan expects me in 20 minutes.
The box is actually intended for someone else.
Whatever it is, if it's not about locating Reddington...
It's not, but...

Sir...
Sir, I've been subpoenaed to testify in front of a grand jury.
I'm not supposed to tell you because you're a target of the investigation.
Me?

Julian Gale's convinced the us attorney that we've broken the law.
Sir, he's coming after us.
All of us.
Mr. Kaplan:

Weapons.
(Gunshots)
Reddington:

Raymond.
I have to hand it to you, you did it.
My associates, my accounts, cash reserves, gone.
About the only thing you left me is the hat on my head.
And this...
The way out.
The island.
Too many killings, Kate.

I don't want more death, and neither do you.
I simply want this to end.
You can have the island.
To be my prison.

In paradise.
Elizabeth is who she is, Kate.
She's not Masha any more.
With little to none of my presence or influence through the years, she has grown up to be special agent Elizabeth Keen.
Her area of scholarship and expertise is the study of criminals.
The habits and inclinations, the curiosities and proclivities, the psychiatry of criminals, that's who she is.
That may be the world she was born to, but it is most certainly the world she has chosen to live in.
I can continue to give her more distance, but she is going to continue to be who she is, and I'm not going to stop watching out for her.
So, either you go and save yourself, or this ends right here, now.
I'm not going anywhere, Raymond.
So you better make sure you finish the job this time.
For both our sakes.
FBI, drop your weapon!
How'd he find us?

Reddington's got the immunity agreement.

What about Kaplan?
You didn't run.

Just standing here makes my hip flare.
I'm sorry I failed to deliver on my promise to you.
Raymond must have intercepted the immunity agreement, or perhaps the task force did.

No, no.

I needed that document to prove that Keen, Ressler, and I don't know who else in the FBI enabled Reddington to grow and profit from a criminal empire.
The date on that agreement, that was my smoking gun to bring them down.
So, yeah, it does matter, because without it, I got nothing.
Wrong.

Raymond thinks he out-manoeuvred me today, but he underestimated my commitment.
I've been his cleaner, keeper, and confessor for 30 years.
And I'm prepared to tell you everything you need to know, in open court.
In exchange for immunity?

So maybe we should get on with it and you should arrest me.
