Previously on Wynonna Earp...
- You're injured.

- I have to find this psycho named Tucker.

Constance.

- That little Tucker is dead.

- You're...

- Everything's changed.

Give her this.
It always comes back to the Curse, Waves, always.
- I wasn't the heir.

The Seven are gone.
Just like that, huh?
Marshals!

Tucker Gardner, we're here for you,
- you little skidmark.

- Help!

Wynonna?
- Thank God you came!

You don't have him?

I'm sorry, I'm-I'm...
I'm just really freaked out and, um, angry.
I'll check the bedrooms.
The last thing we remember, we passed out, and then we woke up locked in this room.
While you say you were asleep,
Pervert Gardner Junior kidnapped a girl and held her in my sister's bedroom.
I wish I could say I didn't know it was just a matter of time.
Tucker's out of his tree.

- the Pinot Grigio.

Umm, no idea what you're talking about.
You sure you're not just hormonal?

We've been locked in here for days.
We're victims, just like everyone else!
Everyone?
Yeah.
She doesn't need a backrub.

- and find Tucker.

We'll be watching the house 24-7.
You're watching us?

It's for your protection.
Yeah, just in case he comes back.
If you have nothing to hide, what's the problem?
We're not like our brother.
I thought you of all people would get that.
Nah, sorry.

- to play nice anymore.

Let us know if you see him.
- What is it?

- but I feel it in my gut.

- Don't look at my gut.

Uh, have you seen a doctor or...?
- Mercedes wasn't Mercedes!

Usually, she's a fun bitch, not a bitch bitch, which is like "Whoa, bitch," but...
- It's a bitch thing.

Tucker had Hypnos put the town to sleep for the Widows.
Are the Gardner sisters working for them too?
I don't have the resources to monitor this place 24-7, but I've learned to trust your instincts.
Well, I hope so 'cause not being able to trust anyone ever, it's just...
Super lonely.

You can't say that, that's our...

- Head rush.

- of health clearance, OK?

OK.

Oh.
Hey, Doc.
We got a Code Rainbow.
We should have claimed new faces when we had the chance.
She knows it was us.

If she touched me, I would have screamed.
- We should go.

We can't risk them finding this.
That little shit killed one of the two people who knew how to find the third seal.
Hm, Tucker, he was simply too... human.
As for his little gift...
Maybe Constance can still
- help us.

If we can't hurt her, we can't trust her.
We need to work fast, keep Wynonna and that gun away until we find the last seal.
And then...
Our love burns bright and true.
Holliday.
Wake up.
- Reeves!

- Wake up.

- Did I fall asleep?

I found him.
You found him?

He has been decloaked.
Alright.
I knew you could do it.
Fetch me my pistol.
Still, after all these years.
No matter.
This one's worth the wait.
Mark him with fire.
We need to do this one by the book.
Doc Holiday will hang for his crimes.
- These Widows, what are they?

They broke out of BBD containment thanks to Doc's dynamite.
Not that I blame him for anything.
"Unclassified"?
Well, BBD is a big, bureaucratic place.
We hadn't gotten around to examining them yet.

Together?

That's why we didn't know about the paralyzing venom.
Yeah, which hurts like a mother.

What we do know is that they've destroyed two seals and are tearing
Purgatory apart to find the third.
Yes.

Hey, I've translated some of the text from one of the seal fragments.
It's ancient Phoenician.

"Let Thee Rise"?
Dramatic.

My least favourite Boyz II Men album.
OK, so why didn't Tucker get breath bombed?
Huh?

They needed him.

- And Mercedes and Beth?

The doctor is in.
- Here's your patient.

- Yeah.

Can I examine you somewhere private?
Dude, it's how I got into this mess in the first place.

Not often am I whisked away in a shroud of secrecy by two burly men.
If you're being held against your will, wave around your yogurt spoon.
Just overprotective coworkers.
They don't want the bad guys to know I'm marshaling for two.
Well, the heartbeat is... strong.
Uh, how long since your last period?
Oof, can't say I miss the ole gal or had been tracking her visits.
- Have you been pregnant before?

Smoking?
- It makes my hair smell gross.

This... this whole thing
- took me by surprise.

Sorry, judge is sort of a trigger word.
You're very nice.

Umm, what about genetic testing?
'Cause my family's history is pretty fakakte.
That should have been done months ago.
- Only blood samples.

From you and, if possible, the father?
Regardless, this is the last time
I make a cloak-and-dagger trip to the middle of nowhere.
Next appointment is in my office with my equipment, where I can examine you properly.
Is it Bring your own speculum?
Hey.

Doctor-patient privilege ring a bell?
Take it outside, cowboy.

- I will.

Listen, you and me
- surveillance, alright?

- in the field like...

- to Cosmic-con, alright?

Quiet.

She's strong.
The baby will be too.
Hey, go outside.
Smoke, shoot things.
I do need to stay sharp.
I wonder how many generations have surveyed this land.
An Earp and a Holliday.
- Damn.

- Doc Holliday?

Holy crow!

Don't be foolish.

Whatever the hell you are, you should not be on this land.
I'm starting to think you're not here for my autograph.
So, Doc's outside.
Yeah, I think it's, uh,
- starting to settle in.

Him being a dad.
- Did he say that?

The more he feels, the less he says.
Like a masseuse.
Waves... they need blood samples from both parents to do genetic testing.
- He's gonna freak out.

No, he's not scared of anything.

I'm terrified.

Aaah!

Wynonna, what?

Hmmm...
Just that Doc might not be the dad.
Then who is?
Don't shoot, I'm just the messenger.
Despite my reputation,
I've never been one to gun down a child.
Who said anything about guns?
- What the hell do you want?

- It was a long time ago.

- A witch threw me in a well!

Aaargh!
Goddammit!
You've been marked with fire for capture and execution.
I suggest you get your affairs in order.

Let him come.
Oh, my God!

- Yeah?

Or relieved!
Hey, Doc "No strings attached" Holliday!
Are you serious?

He's nothing but strings.

How could this happen?
Would you like me to draw you a diagram?

Look, Doc and I, we didn't promise each other anything, so we can be grownups about this.
- He's gonna shoot everything.

OK.
Grownups or not,
I'll be here when you tell him.
OK?

- Hi!

- Yeah, gotta go.

No, we should... we should talk.
I never thanked you for your note.
It-it really mattered.

May I ask... are you doing alright?
Of course you can ask.
Things have changed since my day regarding male participation in these matters... but I'll be as involved as you desire.
No more, no less.
All I want, and excuse me for being old-fashioned, is for you to be healthy... for you to be as close to happy as possible.
And I will do anything,
I will give anything to ensure it.
You're such an asshole.
Maybe I said it wrong.
Uh...
The doctor wants us to do blood tests.
Of course.

I...

Well then, I'll leave you to it.
Doc.

- Wait, Doc!

No...

Oh, come on now, you cursed piece of junk!
Nicole, hey.

Keep flashing that smile and she'll fall in love with ya.
I told you not to make this weird.
I didn't say I wouldn't.
What are you watching for?
Evil.
Like a basic general evil?
Don't drop those on my floor.
Ah.
Guess, uh, no more Black Badge means the ban on co-worker hook-ups is over.
You know, Wynonna is having Doc's baby, that's just like... crazy.
I mean, imagine the little rascal if he has
Doc's piercing blue eyes and Wynonna's luscious hair.
I swear, seriously, we are going to be defenseless against such a glorious creature.

I'm not saying I'm gonna do it, but I wouldn't say no to some sort of light babysitting or daycare dates.

Hey, what was the first rule of stakeout?
- Shutting up, yeah.

Man...
Must be an easier way to find these Widows.
Lure them or bait them.
Oh, God!
- Oh, my God!

No, no, no way.

This is a...

- Looks like one of their veils.

Probably still some venom on it.
That must have fell off when Wynonna shot them.
Alright, listen, we're gonna bag this up, OK?

Yeah, you're a genius!
You're like Rizzoli and Isles combined.
Shutting up.
Waverly left.
Cellphones, people, use 'em.
You'll have to take a raincheck on the ol' pop-by.
Nicole, I'm leaving.

Look, who would I rather piss off?

Waverly sent you to babysit.
- Well, "mommysit" technically.

I am not to let you out of my sight until she comes back.
You're going through a lot, and she doesn't want you to be alone right now.
Fine.

That's a little early to hit Shorty's.
Not Shorty's.

You're coming or what?
- I guess I'm drinking for two.

I hate doing it everything sober.
Whoa...
So much for being grownups about it.
I am too occupied to translate whatever cryptic thing you are telling me.
I just hope all this ammo isn't target practice on every guy in town who's ever looked at Wynonna
- with a tinkle in his... eye.

Doc, you're still a part of this family, even if the baby isn't yours.
Ohhh, poop.
She didn't tell you.
Oh, God, I...
Could be she'll be better off.
Hey, everybody, put your hands together for your favourite:

So this is Pussy Willows, huh?
Wrong side of the wrong side of the tracks.
What kind of girls end up working in a place like this?
Well, maybe one with no family, a reputation for conjuring up fake demons and no other way to raise money for a bus ticket out of here?
Where you been, Aphrodite?
Oh, hello. 'Sup, TJ?
I have my period, so you'll have to...
Who's Aphro...?

Pace yourself, there's...

I came here a few months ago, when
I got so drunk even Shorty's wouldn't serve me anymore,
- and I did something.

Him.
Ah!
Well, drunk Wynonna
- still has standards.

No beer goggles here.
Wait, sorry, how many months ago?
Oh, just... yea many.
Well, OK.

Mr. One-night-stand that you're now a crazy chick with a bun in the oven?
Officer Haught, so sweet, so naive.
Ahem!

You're gonna buy him a drink, and then you're gonna steal the glass for the saliva sample.
Science will tell us who the dad is, and then we murder science to keep its filthy mouth shut, and hopefully I never have to tell Doc about this whole unsavoury scenario.
- That actually is a good plan.

Wynonna Earp by confronting problems head on.
- Hey!

- Ugh!

His eyes, did you see his eyes?
- Oh, shit!

- Get him out of here.

- you...

It's OK.

- Shit, shit!

After I killed the last of the seven, the... the Jack of Knives, it destroyed me.
So I dealt with it the best way
I knew how:

Lord, did I binge!
I just...

Most of the night was a blur.
Doc offered to bring me home, but I wasn't done so I came here.
It just...

I wanted to feel something good.
And he was nice.

And you now what?

I never thought I'd see him again.
OK, uh, so... you're the Earp heir, and he's a revenant, so that means the baby is...

It's Waverly.

Hey, cutie!
Don't "cutie" me.
Hi, sweetie-pie.

Uh...

- and we're... fine.

You have to!
- I hear music.

Trashy.

You're at a strip joint!
Aphrodite made me do it!
- Ah!

Tell me which one.
- I'm so sorry.

OK, yeah, I guess I deserved that.
Hello?
Oh, you did not just hang up on me.
Next time, this... means don't tell my sister we're at a sleazy knocker locker.
Oh.

You know me, you know how I am, I can't lie to her.
See?

I guess I deserved that too.
I did drag you into the shit storm.
And I...

- Ready?

Wynonna?
Woman, how long has it been?
Oh, I'd say... about 28 weeks.
Hey, Doc.
Are we in immediate danger or something?
We are not.

- be unprepared for a fight.

Yeah, I suppose.
Also congratulations, man.
About Wynonna.

Listen.

I wanted to get along and just be mature about it.
Dolls!

I found traces of a powerful glycosylation toxin.

Doc, perfect!
I need two other sets of hands, and yours are so nimble and soft...
Not now, Jeremy.

Hey, hey, listen.

Step out of my way.
If I do, you sure as hell ain't taking our weapons.
- Yeah.

I'll give you three.
So if you ever find yourselves building a temporary shelter in a flood zone, do not forget to write your name on the inside of your mosquito helmet.
- Amateur move, Haught.

Welcome to the stage,
- Vanessa!

Are we having a good time?
Yeah, we are, which is why we're gonna need a few more of those peppermint shots.
Because it's like drinking Christmas.
- You redheads are wild.

- I like you.

You too, Wynonna.
Even if you are here to kill me.
If I distill the toxin to its essential elements,
I can use them to develop a vaccine making us impervious to the Widows' vapour.
You may be a wiz with chemicals, but temporal measurement is not your strong suit.
- Five minutes?

OK, yeah.

Doll, you will remove the stopper, then I will add the accelerant.

- You ready?

Is he praying?
In Icelandic?

Oh, hold up.
Oh, my God!

Hey, stop!
- What are you doing?

Ooh, what?

- Oh, God!

- Oh!

We didn't trap it, we just inhaled it.
A pungent magic show and a complete waste of my time!
Jeremy,
- what in damnation...

Congratulations.

You bound us all together!
I...
I'm a wizard.
So you knew who I was, and you had sex with me
- without telling me what you are.

We just came here for a drink.
Yeah.

- OK, let me do the talking.

Baby, you're better at...
Watch your mouth, or the little friend
- in my boot comes out to play.

And I got one too 'cause I'm a cop.
Ah, nuts!
- I left it at home.

Let's not make a scene.
I got a lot of friends here.
If it comes to it, they'll surrou you before you can even pop off two shots.
He's got a point.
What do you want, "anus"?
I mean, Jonas.
First, I wanna gloat.
And then I wanna ask you out on a second date.
We could do it out back.
If memory serves, it only takes ten minutes.
Oof, ten minutes?

Well, milady, you kind of don't have a choice.
- Tell me you just got fat.

It's right, I keep one in my sock.
How smart am I?

- I'm smart.

We need an unbinding spell, Jeremy.
- And we need it pronto!

Whoa-whoa-whoa!
My quarrel's with Mr. Holliday,
- you can go.

I can't.
Whatever they are paying you, I'll pay double.
Justice is my only compensation.
I do hate myself an honourable man.
As I hate myself a hypocrite.
Ow!
- Jeremy!

Go!

Nooo!
- I hate myself a phantom more.

You're the one who evaporated into thin air, Holliday.
But... justice delayed is still justice served.
Nothing from this earthly world can...
- Yeah!

I don't know.
Take my keys, you drive.
Yeah, no kidding.

- Good aim too.

Wait, abort, abort!
Sorry.
He knows.

What if he tells the rest of them?
They're gonna come for it... and you!
Hey, wait!
- Is that mine?

It's not supposed to be possible.
Do you know what we've done here?
We've started a new race.
We're the new Adam and Eve.
I see you more as the snake.
You wouldn't.
Come on, no fair!

Door prize.
- He's a bad guy, right?

You are drunk!

I hit three other strip clubs!
Three!

I have on me?

- Hey, you OK?

Him.
Oh.
So what do we do with him?
Take him for a ride.
So... tell me what you do to piss somebody off so bad
- that they're still after you.

- So what did you do?

The right woman, the wrong night.

This is about a girl?
You're the most selfish guy I know.
You do whatever you want, whenever you want, and then when you get in trouble, you bring everybody down with you.
Oh, I thought we were gonna be mature about things.
I was leaving to face my demons on my own, which is how I work best.
Wynonna, that baby, they need you, so this whole lone-wolf shit that you're doing, it ain't gonna cut it.
'Cause guess what, Doc, you're gonna be a daddy.
Well, it is quite possible that I ain't.

Huzzah!

- So like what?

What?
Gentlemen,
I do believe we have some unfinished business to attend.
Ghost.

Who you gonna call?

Sir.
- Recompense is a-coming.

- Jeremy, you're making this worse!

Jeremy, stop!
Ohhh, it's a whole ghost cavalry.
Well, shit!

Don't even think about it.
That is a Colt Lightning.
Your personal effects will be given to your next of kin.
Wonderful.
You served under the great Wyatt Earp... yet a criminal.
A waste.
Let me out!
Hey!
Oh, God, I think I just had a hangover.
Haven't been this close to a revenant in a while.
I mean, you know, not that I know of.
- It's not always obvious.

OK, what-what if the baby's not his?
It doesn't matter, he knows I'm pregnant.
We let him go, they all know.
OK, so we hold him somewhere.
- Yeah.

It's what she does, Nicole.
It could be there's another way.
Don't know what it is though.
He might.
I-I got us stuck,
I ran like a coward, this is all my fault.
Don't forget, I fornicated with the judge's wife twice.
Oh, God, you even screw up cooler than me.
- What now?

- a firing squad.

Look, you said yourself your quarrel is with me.
Let them go.
In harbouring a fugitive, they made themselves accomplices... and shall be punished as such.
You are victims of my mistakes, and for that, I am truly sorry, gentlemen, but I'm not going down without a fight.
So ready yourselves.
John Henry Holliday, you've received a sentence of death for seduction with intent to fornicate with the wife of the honourable Justice
Stanley Parker... twice.
Doc Holliday... is a class-A pain in the ass... but he's also one of the most loyal and solid and fearless man I've ever met.
Yeah, he can be a polecat sometimes, but he's a changed man.

Son of a bitch!
Uh, it was... it was a great speech.
No, they branded me.
The five circles, each indicate a point on the five-sided star.
The U.S. Marshals' badge.
- You are all unusually close.

I know.
- Reeves?

- Now, as I was saying...

- Do I know you?

- You're the reason why I wanted to be a lawman!

Now, any last words?
I got three!

- That's our motto.

- Going to my pocket.

I'm a supervisory deputy marshal, and I have several deputies under my command.
You outrank me.

Sir!
Sir.
Doc Holliday is under my jurisdiction, gentlemen, and, uh, you are relieved of your duties in this particular case.
As you wish, Deputy Marshal.
As for Doc Holliday...
Thank you.
Doc Holliday, you...
- are pardoned.

- the weapons.

I'm so tired.
- Whoo!

That was... that was Bass Reeves, man!
What?

So, you mean any of those things you said?
Nah.

You do.
What makes you think
- this kid could be yours?

That's the problem with rumours:
people tend to believe them.
This is history.

- preggers.

I remember that night.
You stumbling in all doe-eyed drunk, working those West-coast hips to a little Lana... teasing out lap dances for free.
- Stop it!

Of course, I was the only one that knew you were the heir.
I admit I was hoping you'd be a bit more of a challenge.
I always heard you had a mouth on you.
And you do.
Hmm, baby, one smile from me, and those legs
- popped right open.

- your stupid, sexist pie hole!

- about her pie hole.

You see, we always thought the best way to defeat the heir was to kill her,
Lucky for us, she's a whore who defeated herself by letting one of us get inside of her.
Must be frustrating for you how much the world is changed.
- I'm your kid's father.

I'm gonna raise this kid to be good and strong, and everything you're not.
You know, an Earp.
I'd say, "and don't you forget it," but you ain't got that kind of time.
Here's to single motherhood.
You're a superhero.
Same damn thing.
- Wynonna...

This baby, what is it?
Ours.
- Is it gonna leave a mark?

- You had no plan out there, huh?

They hadn't cocked their guns yet.

Old 45s can't pierce body armour.
Thought it'd absorb a few hits, then take 'em out while they reloaded.
Body armour, and you couldn't have shared?
Particularly as only you could touch them for some reason.
Yeah, we share a likeness.
We're both marshals.

I've oft brought calamity onto others, on that you are correct, but believe me,
I do not always get what I want!
Well, you are the father.
Because we need you to be a father.
Those marshals found you after all this time, what do you think has changed?
I was at the bottom of a well for a long time, but now, uh, there is someone I need to visit.
How long until this bond wears off?
I think it already has.
And Jeremy, he's no wizard.
Shhh!
Here, man.
I suppose I could linger.
She's not going anywhere.
I have an ultrasound booked next week, but if my OBGYN is expecting samples, tough luck, she ain't getting any.

I already know the pre-existing conditions on the one hand, revenant-it is, on the other,
Wyatt Earp's best friend.
Fakakte.
I'm sorry.
I kind of talked to Doc.
Waverly, what?
I...

I thought you told him.

Then I chickened out about telling you I chickened out, so...
Whoops.

There I said it, baby.
Still weird.
It's an Earp.
As Earp as you and me.
Hey, you're Auntie Waverly.
Yay!
You need to teach this thing its history.
Hey, what's going on?
Wave.
What about my history?
Waverly.
I don't think I'm your sister... or even an Earp at all.
What?
