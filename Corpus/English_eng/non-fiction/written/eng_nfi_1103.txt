Toothbrush and toothpaste.
What you got, Devon?
What do you want?
What you got in your hands for starters.
Then I'll think about what else.
Thanks, sweetheart.
You need it more than me anyway.
What the hell you just say?
Hey, I thought you might need this.
Well, you thought wrong.
You want to survive in here, newbie, mind your own damn business.
(Jane) Hey, you sleep okay?
No, not really.
Was it the radiator?
I need to get that thing fixed.
When are you gonna tell weller about my memory about Emma Shaw?
(Muffled cries)
I will, okay?

You've proven yourself to the team and weller trusts you now and he fought so hard to get you out of the cell.
Which is why we owe him the truth.
(Door opens)
You wanted to see me?

Is this about zapata?

She's holding up.

(Door closes)
I got reports that you're not going home at night.
Is that true?

Why-- why would I not--?

Your keycard log.

You know, there's a lot of things that need to be done and some of my lab techs are new and it's just easier to do things myself.
Part of being a leader is learning how to trust your team and learning how to delegate.
Everything needs to be done right and we can't afford to make any more mistakes.
What we can't afford is having you burn out.
I'm sorry.

Patterson, wait.
I know this just isn't a case anymore.
This is personal for all of us.
We have to start looking after ourselves and each other.

So I booked an appointment for you tonight to see Dr. sun, so, please, don't miss it.
Hey, Kurt.

How's zapata?
I'm on my way to see her now.
How's the new living situation going?
Good.

I mean, he goes from the safe house to therapy and back home again every single day.
He's out of his cage but he's not exactly out in the world.
Why don't you guys come over for dinner tonight?
I can make my famous thai curry.
Yeah, okay.
I'll see you guys at, like, 8:00?

(Liz) It was you, wasn't it, snitch?
(Devon) I have no idea what you're talking about.
The warden just tossed my cell, saying she heard I was stealing cigarettes.
Then maybe you should stop.
Oh, come at me, bitch!

Oh!
What's your problem, fish?
You're in my way.

I said, you're in my way.
(Laughing)
Hey!

You start this, Liz?
Man, I'm a victim here.
All right, who wants to talk?
That's how you guys want to play this?

Yard time's revoked indefinitely.

You, come on.

(Buzzer)
(Door opens)
(Door closes)
What the hell happened?
I'm fine.

Tasha, this operation isn't worth risking your life.
♪♪
♪ my my my how you have... ♪
All right, next round on me.
I'm so sorry.

I buy drinks all the time.
Yeah, for yourself.
(Laughter)
Oh, no, wait.

You did buy me drinks once.

Of course, that was when I didn't have an ID or any money or any memories at that point.
Well, well, all right.
That doesn't count.

Oh.
What's that?
My team's been piecing together the shredded documents from sandstorm's forger.
We got another name.
Devon penberthy, arrested and placed in county jail two weeks ago for transporting weapons across state lines.
Presumably for sandstorm.
Which means Devon might know what sandstorm plans on using them for.
All right, so this is our chance to get intel from someone who's been in the fold.
Let's bring her in.

If she's sandstorm, she's not gonna talk.
You got a better idea?
Let me go undercover, get close to her.
If Devon is in Shepherd's inner circle, she'll know who you are and what you look like.
Put me in, coach.
No.

Yeah, but there is less of a chance and it's worth the risk.
We've got to stop playing defense if we want to get ahead of them.
All right, but we have to take major precautions.
I want you to get Tasha a false ID with rock-solid backstopping and some way to be able to call out.
I'll get you a burner phone, but you're gonna have to smuggle it in.

Tasha, you're gonna be in there alone with a lot of dangerous criminals.
No gun, no badge, no backup.
No one can know we're doing this.
Not even the cops that arrest me.
We gave you ways to call out for a reason.
You should have contacted us the minute that happened.
I started the fight.
It's part of my plan to get in tight with Devon.
You can't take risks like that.
I was in total control.

Really?

So, what about the next time?
What about when there's more of them?
What about when you don't see them coming, which will happen?
I'm pulling the plug on this.
This isn't just any op.
Devon is the best shot we have at finding Shepherd and stopping phase two.
You pull me out now, we'll never get close to her again, and you know it.
Give me one more day.

You've got 12 hours and that's it.
(Door slams)
Must be your lucky day.
They don't always wait 'til you're not in it.
♪♪
How's zapata?
She's bullheaded as ever.

You okay?
There's something I've been meaning to talk to you about.
It's about Roman.
Is he all right?

Uh, he just-- he-- he remembered something he did, something terrible.
He killed Emma, Taylor Shaw's mother.
Look, I was just as shocked as you are when he told me, and, obviously, he's been extremely upset over the memory.
When did he tell you that, Jane?
A few weeks ago.
Look, he wanted to tell you right away, but I asked him not to.
Look, I'm sorry I kept it from you for so long.
I was just trying to find the right time.
The right time would have been when you found out, instead of protecting your brother.
No, I was trying to protect you.
From what, Jane?
You were trying to get your brother released from his cell, and you did, by lying to me.
Kurt, that is not what-- look, I knew how upsetting the news would be.
Jane, your brother has killed someone that is very close to me.
You chose to keep that a secret.
That is a total breach of our trust as friends.
I'm sorry.
You compromised this mission, Jane.
We could have been following up on Emma's case.
We could have been finding out who was in on that cover-up.
No, look, just let me work with Dr. sun and Roman and maybe I-- do you really think I'm gonna keep letting you run with this?
You get out of my office.
(Buzzer)
Devon.
Riva.
So, what are you in for?
Stupid drug charge.
They told me to rat on my people.

Norteños locos.

The cops know I have enough to wipe 'em out, but I ain't no snitch.
All you got in this world are your people.
Betray that, and you're nothing.
How'd you get that?
Hot rifle barrel.
Back before I knew how to shoot.
I worked at a gun range after high school.
You're not from here.
I grew up in the white mountains.
Boyfriend?

Seven years now.
Met him at that same gun range.

(Beeping)
(Groaning)
Why do you hate me?
(Static)
Stuart, what is up with the system?
An os update came out.
I installed it on half the computers last night.

Some of the computers were running code-breaking software.
I couldn't interrupt, so I figured I'd install-- you figured you'd lock up half my computers for a day?
Everything okay?
Yeah, it's fine.
Okay, so zapata used her burner phone to send me some intel on Devon and I found a gun range in the white mountains that lines up with Devon's story.
It's owned by Wes hartley, 55, substantial rap sheet.
Shouldn't be anywhere near a firearm yet owns a shooting range.
Any recent ties between hartley and Devon?
Nothing on paper, but I get the vibe he's not a paperwork kind of guy.
Zapata also mentioned that Devon met her longtime boyfriend at the range.
You think it could be hartley?
I mean, that would be a pretty serious may-December romance, but anything's possible.
You know, Devon was arrested for moving arms, so maybe she was getting weapons for sandstorm from this guy.
Get a team to bring him in and tell 'em to use extreme caution.
We have to keep him in custody.
If he does have connections to sandstorm,
I don't want him tipping them off.
(Weller) You recognize her?
Sure.

Can you tell me her full name?
Stella was just a nickname I gave her.
Don't recall her real one.
She used to work for me off the books.
When was the last time you saw her?
About six years.
Would you say that your relationship was purely professional?
If you're asking me if I slept with a teenager eight years ago, the answer is no.
I have a wife who wouldn't appreciate that.
In fact, the reason she quit is, she got hot and heavy with her boyfriend.
I think they moved away together someplace.
Do you remember his name?
No, but he had a face you couldn't forget.
Real skinny and pale, cold blue eyes.
Hell of a sniper, though.
He used to come by the range sometimes.
Is that him?

(Jane) That's Parker.

Do you have any idea what role he plays?
No, but with Roman and borden out of play,
I'm guessing he's gotten a lot higher up on the food chain.
According to zapata's intel,
Devon's been dating the same guy for seven years.
All right, so if Devon's with Parker and he's a key sandstorm member, that makes her a lot more valuable than we thought.
This could be the break that we need.
Patterson, get a word to Tasha on the burner.
It's a new plan.
We've got to get to Parker through Devon.
When's the last time you talked to him, your boyfriend?
The day I got arrested.
He doesn't visit?
It's complicated.
He can't get mixed up in this.
Yeah, I get it.
Listen, I have a phone if you ever want to call him.
How the hell did you get that?
My cousin was in here for about a year.
She got a little friendly with one of the cos.
I'm just saying...

(Groaning)
She's bleeding!

(Phone ringing)
Tasha, you've got all of us.
Devon's been stabbed.
She's gonna be okay, but she's in the infirmary.
Who did it?
Another inmate, Liz, the same girl I picked a fight with.
Why would you do that?
We've got to get Devon out now, all right?
I'll make a deal, get her charges dropped.
Once she's out, we can track her back to Parker.
She's being held without bail, awaiting trial.
You release her now, she's gonna know something's up.
It's clearly not safe in there for either of you anymore.
Then we get her out another way.
You mean besides with permission?
If I break her out, she'll go straight for Parker-- I know it.
No.

How many more innocent people have to die before we end this?
Shepherd is out there right now, planning something big, and I am on the inside, and this is our chance to make a major move.
I want Shepherd just as much as you do.
There's never gonna be a perfect plan.
I'm doing this with or without you.
No.

I'm not asking you for permission.
I'm asking you for help.
♪♪
Let me spot you.
Sure.
Jane came to see me.
She told me about Emma...
(Groaning) ...about what you did to her.
Sir?
I should have told you right away.
Did she suffer?
No.

I'm sorry.

The person who did that doesn't exist anymore.
He died the moment Shepherd erased my memory.
And I know there's nothing I can say that will change your mind right now and I understand if you want to put me back in the cell.
Don't blame Jane.
She was just trying to do the right thing.
You're right.
There's nothing you can say to me.
(Door slams)
Weller, hey.
We were just going over the layout of the cell blocks.
Yes?
Uh, okay.

Devon's been recovering in.
Zapata needs to retrieve her, go down this hall, which leads to an exit along the least heavily guarded side of the building.
How do we get them outside?
The power in this wing is controlled by one grid.
If we cut the lines, it'll unlock this exit and kill the juice to the electric fence in the yard.
There has to be a backup generator.
There is one, but it's old.
It takes a while to warm up and kick in, so once the power's out, they have about three minutes to hop the fence.
Where they'll find the getaway car we planted and be home free.

Well, yeah, I might have skipped over a couple details.
You know, guards, inmates, the razor wire on the fence, zapata having to convince Devon to go with her in the first place.
Also, we need to get you into the jail to cut the power because it can't be done remotely.
♪♪
(Electrical zapping)
Devon.

What are you doing?
I'm busting you out of here.
Are you crazy?
Do you know what'll happen if we get caught?
Do you know what'll happen if we stay?
Liz is after both of us now and getting shivved is gonna feel like a massage compared to what she'll do to us next.
I...

Do you want to live to see your boyfriend again?
'Cause that's not gonna happen if you stay.
I don't know about you, but I'm not gonna sit around and let some bitch take me down.
How would it work?
The co that got me the phone, she's gonna help us out.
My boyfriend's crew is hooking us up with a car.
Okay, let's do it.

Put this on.
(Entry alarm)
I've got to upgrade your service panel.
Follow me.

(Coughing)
Here.

You sick or something?
No.

Let's hope it's not what my kid's got.
They're saying that, you know, that whooping cough...

They're saying it's back.
(Coughing) Anyway, hold that for me.
No.

Just don't leave this area.

I'll get back to work.
I'm in.
Okay, there should be a switch labeled...
There's no switch and there's no labels.
It looks like a bunch of spaghetti.
Awesome.

Wait, we don't have a minute.
Look, zapata's already in the corridor.
Hang on.

You're sure that it's these two?
Well, as sure as I can be with five seconds left.
(Inmates clamoring)
Quiet down, quiet down!

Come on.

Shouldn't you be in the infirmary?
No.

This is very not ideal.

You only have three minutes.

Yo, you deaf?
I'm a quick healer.
Not today, bitch.
(Groaning)
(Jane) We need to give her more time.
How do you knock out the backup generator?
Uh, you have to do it manually.

The roof of the jail.
Hey!

No!

(Groaning)
Come on, come on, come on.
There should be car stashed on the other side.
The key's in the wheel well.
(Groaning)
(Engine starting)
(Tires squealing)
(Panting)

Did you see the look on Liz's face when you took down her girl?
What about you?

Yeah, I could have taken Liz down in the kitchen too if it wasn't for her ten friends standing next to her.
(Devon) We could check into a motel somewhere.
(Zapata) With what money?
The first place they're gonna look around here are motels.
What about your boyfriend?

No.

I know a place, somewhere off the grid.
I told Roman that I know about Emma.
I know you're angry, but be angry at me.
This wasn't his fault.
Roman wants me to be angry at him and you want me to be angry at you.
Don't worry.

Roman is destroyed by what he did.
You and I both know he's not the same person now, just like I'm not the same person.
You were able to look past the things that I had done before I came to the FBI.
I'm asking you to try to find a way to give Roman that same shot.
When Emma died,
I felt like there was no one left that missed Taylor as much as I do.
Emma was the only person that never told me to move on.
She never told me to stop searching.
And now, to find out she was killed because of her connection to me...
I know exactly how that feels.
It's just another part of my life that's been manipulated and destroyed by Shepherd.
We're gonna get her, and when we do, we're going to get every last answer we deserve.
Damn it.

You're bleeding out.
I can't exactly walk into an er.
Okay, I get it.

Is there someone else you could call?
If something happens, how is he gonna feel knowing he could have done something?
We broke out of jail to see the people we love again.
Right?
(Dialing)
(Line ringing)
Parker, it's me.

No, I escaped.
A friend.
I didn't want to call you, but we need help.
I'm hurt.

(Parker) How bad is the injury?
(Devon) It's pretty deep.
I just ripped my stitches.

(Parker) I'm getting on the road right now.
Meet me in the parking lot of Lenny's deli off route 33.
(Devon) Hopefully we make it.

It's such a piece of junk.
(Parker) Have faith.
Okay.

(Ends call)
Patterson.

I want you to send undercover units to the deli.
Tell 'em they have to use extreme caution.

On it.

It is crucial we take Parker and Devon alive.
Copy that.

That means Shepherd might be close as well.
Are we taking the scenic route?
No.

We don't have time.
The cops'll be right behind us.
They're stopping.

Looks like some kind of scrap metal yard.
Something's up.

About two Miles.
(Devon) That's my boyfriend.
I thought you said he was meeting us at the deli.
I used a code in case the phone was being tapped.
This scrapyard has been abandoned for years.
We used to always pass it on the way into the city.
I knew he'd know what I meant.
(Car door closes)
You okay?

Parker, this is riva.
Special agent zapata.
What?
You're a fed?
No, not just any fed.
She was assigned to remi's case.
This was a setup.
I think you have me confused with someone else.
(Groaning)
There's no one here.
Patterson.

Tasha's gone.

Notify agents in the surrounding area.
Check all the traffic cams.
Should I mobilize air support?
No.

We can't put Tasha in more danger than she's already in.
We couldn't find the cell phone in the car, but maybe she took it with her.
Are you getting any kind of signal?
I was, but it went dead.
All right.

Uh, east on 33.

All right, we're heading that way.
And Patterson, try to turn that phone on remotely.
It's Tasha's only lifeline.
(Devon) I should have known when she tried to get close to me.
It doesn't matter now.

Weller wants his teammate back,
Shepherd wants weller, and now we use her to get to weller.
(Static)
No.

Stuart, do you want to tell me why my computer crashed again?
I know, I know.

It's causing all sorts of glitches.
You said the update just came out.

We never do a full install until we run a bug check first.
Sorry.

Agent Patterson!

You disabled half the computers in my lab.
What are you doing here?

Who do you work for?

All right, I know I screwed up.
It won't happen again.
Uh, sorry.

Patterson, what have you got for us?
Actually, this is Stuart, one of the lab techs.
Where's Patterson, Stuart?
She had to step away, but there was an alert that you should know about.
Agent zapata's cell was turned back on briefly just long enough for us to trace it.
She's sending up a flare.
What's the address, Stuart?
219 prospect way, an abandoned warehouse in the Bronx.
I've got the blueprints.

It's a big space.

Two levels.
Looks like there's a group of silos leading up to the second floor.
When backup arrives,
I want you to take beta team and clear the silos.
You don't want to enter together?
No, it's better this way.
You're the only one that I trust out there.
(Tires squealing)
♪♪
Clear the silos.

All right, just remember, no kill shots.
Take all suspects alive.

Two left, two right, two with me.
(Zapata) Weller!
(Panting)
Bomb!
Tasha, this is rigged to a pressure plate.
You try to get off it, it'll set off the bomb, okay?
They knocked me out.
I don't know where they went.

FBI!
All right, keep us covered!
I need to get you off that thing.
Here.
I'm gonna drag this fridge onto that plate.
You think I weigh as much as a fridge?
Do you see a mini fridge around here?
It'll do.
All right.

Now, when I place this onto that plate, you jump up and move.

Nope.
3, 2, go!
(Groaning)
Okay, I guess I weigh as much as a fridge.
(Groaning)
(Groaning)
Devon, no!

It's over.
We got 'em.
We know you're in Shepherd's inner circle.
We know that you're involved in the ambush that left 12 FBI agents dead.
Devon is gonna go down with you unless you start talking to me.
Nothing?
Both of you are never gonna see the light of day again, you understand?
We just have to keep chipping away.
He'll tire out.

Yes, he will.

Turn off the cameras.
I'll have him singing in 30 seconds.
No.

I've got no problem giving up my gold star in heaven if it means finding out what the hell they're planning and where Shepherd is.
Tasha, I know that you're angry, all right?
You've been to hell and back today.
You're damn right I have.
I put my life on the line out there and I just want to make sure that it was worth something.
I will be damned if we're gonna let him sit there and smile when we know he has all the answers.
Tasha, we have to be strategic, okay?
No.

We have to change the way we do things.
That is the only way we will get ahead of them.
We play by our rules, not theirs.
There are no rules, not when it comes to Shepherd.
Her people were trying to kill you today, or did you miss that?
So, whatever power of protection she gave you seemed to have been revoked.
That doesn't change the fact there's a right way and there's a wrong way to do things, Tasha.
Today's incident at the lab, you accused one of your technicians.
I...

I overreacted.
I just...

I'm finding it hard to trust people right now.
Given what happened with Dr. borden, the fact that you didn't realize he was working for sandstorm, has that caused you to question your judgment?
Do you trust yourself?
Do I trust myself?
Uh...
I second-guess myself every minute of every day.
What Dr. borden did was unforgiveable, but it's not your fault.
You need to put that to rest.
What do you think I'm trying to do?
After he shot me and disappeared,
I wanted to bring him in.

I just...

Dr. borden is gone now.
He can't hurt you anymore.
Can we take a raincheck on that dinner?
Uh, yeah.

Jane, I know that Roman isn't the same person who killed Emma, just like you're not the same person who did all of those things in your past, but I can't just flip a switch and get over this.
This one's personal.
I wish I could change it, the past.
I would do a lot of things very differently.
Me too.
Good night, Jane.
Good night, Kurt.
Sorry I don't have anything stronger.
No, I'm sorry.
The last thing you need is me coming over and bitching about work.
I've just missed having someone to talk to.
You got weller.
Can anyone really talk to weller besides Jane?
He's not exactly an open book, but the man, for sure, still has our back.
Yeah, with one hand tied behind his.
If we want to win this war, we have to shake things up.
How do you plan on doing that?
I'm just saying there is a world where we don't cross every t and dot every I.
Right, and whatever that world is, it's not the FBI.
Hey.

Yeah, we talked.
Look, it's gonna take some time, but I think he'll come around.
I'll take your word for it.
(Groaning)
Damn it.

Well, go run it under some cold water.
I'll grab the first aid kit.
It's fine.

Here, let me see.
No, it's fine, really.
Ooh.
Here you go.

When you injected me with that drug,
I got the chance to start over again, and now you will too.
Aah!
What is it?
You lied to me.
What?

You erased my memory.
You, not Shepherd.
