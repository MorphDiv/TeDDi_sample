Home delivery.
You stay the fuck away from me.
If anyone has an issue with the way I run things, now's your chance to spit it out.
Arrrgh!
Oh, shit!
Ferguson took out the trash when Kaz couldn't.
Yeah, fuck Kaz!
Top Dog!
Top Dog!
If this was an isolated incident I might be able to understand... but Smith has been murdered,
Clearly the attack on Gambaro was Ferguson's handiwork
Now that she is Top Dog we have to be twice as vigilant.
This is just a taste of what she is capable of.
Oh, if only the Department found it so amusing.
One more serious incident, heads will roll.
And it won't be mine.
Get back to work, and take down the fucking decorations!
Well, I hope Kaz is fuckin' happy.
We warned her if she didn't bash Juice someone else would've.
Can they sew a tongue back on, do you reckon?
Sh-sh-sh-sh, she's looking.
What's Tina's problem?
Nah, you'll need to be more specific.
She won't sell me any more gear.
Well, I told her not to.
Why?
You junkies have such a tenuous understanding of cause and affect.
I seem to recall that you attacked me with a billiard ball in a sock.
Does that ring a bell?
What was that about?
Nothing.
Didn't look like nuffin'.
Nothing for you to worry about.
I reckon she's back on the drugs.
Oh, look we don't know that for sure, love.
She gave the Freak her dessert, that's fucked.
Mmm...
There you go.
What's up?
You're not your normal self, Allie.
What... what are you doin' back on the gear?
We're just trying to understand what's going on,
Just lookin' out for ya, love.
Bea would've hated seeing' you back on
I fucking know better than any of you!
I haven't forgotten her, okay.
I never will.
Thanks for the family ambush!
Clearly she doesn't want our help.
Yeah, but she's still part of our family
I don't know how she can suck up to the Freak.
It's 'cause she's a junkie, eh?
Let's just focus now on making you Governor.
Vera's job is hanging by a thread.
We only need to give things a little push.
Just keep your drugs coming thick and fast.
It's only a matter of time.
I've got Ferguson for you, Governor.
Don't sit.
That'll be all, Mr Stewart.
So, is this the meeting where we plan how we're gonna work together,
This is the one where I suspend all your privileges.
On what grounds?
I know it was you.
What's the legal expression?
It's um, it's on the tip of my tongue.
Burden of proof?
Take it up with the Ombudsman.
If you try anything...
I will have you slotted... indefinitely.
Get her out of here.
_
I'll take her back, Nurse.
She is going to tear those women to shreds, piece by piece, and I feel sick about it.
Well, I did try to warn you.
She would have become Top Dog no matter what I did.
Then do something about it.
Kaz...
Okay, sign up for peer worker.
Now, that's a start.
Put your principle into good use.
Not the worst idea I've ever heard.
Do you think you can help me get to the bottom of the drug supply?
How?
Well, Ferguson's propped up by the dealers... we get rid of the drugs, kills two birds.
There is an officer involved, I'm telling you.
It'll be a contract in the laundry or the kitchen.
Okay, prove it.
So, she was trolling' ya?
So what, then you found out where she lived and you bashed her?
So, it's mitigating circumstances.
I'd like a word with Doyle, alone please.
Ms Bennett.
How's your case coming?
Might be an argument for a reduced sentence.
Okay.
I've always admired that about you... your willingness to help the other women, despite what's going on in your own life.
Well, that's me, patron saint of lost causes.
You know, there's a way you could really help them.
Take down Ferguson.
I'd rather keep my tongue,
Well, anyone with half a brain can see that, why haven't you shifted her off to the nuthouse yet?
Because the people with half a brain don't have the evidence to prove it.
So, you want me to fix your problem for you?
Ah, it's not just my problem.
She's making life hell for everyone, including your friends.
You are the only one who can take on Ferguson.
The women will rally around you.
You're not draggin' me back in.
What do you want?
I need to see Ferguson.
Wouldn't advise it.
What is it?
Can you tell Tina it's okay, please?
I feel I'm having déjà vu.
I've got cash, how much do you want?
Oh, fuck!
You know, as entertaining as it might be to watch you grovel, the problem is one of supply and demand.
Product is scarce, prices skyrocketing.
Well, go to my cell then, take whatever you want.
You can have whatever you want.
I doubt that you would have anything of value to offer.
Get her out!
Okay, I'm going.
One, two, three, four...
Oh, Allie.
You guys were right before about Bea.
Oh no, love, look I think we all got a little bit worked up.
Here.
You should have this, not me.
I'm shit at being her widow.
Lovey, that is not true.
Liz, please keep this safe.
No matter what.
Allie...
Hey.
Jesus Christ, it's a bloody barrel of laughs
Look at that.
I can't believe the boys are siding with Ferguson after what she did.
Doesn't look like they've got much choice to me.
Probably scared to death, like the rest of us.
Oh, well boo-fuckin'-hoo.
Nah, if Kaz had let me bash Lucy none of this would've happened, eh?
Ooh, now, Susan, violence isn't the answer to everything.
Yeah, that's what people who can't fight always say.
Always.
Ferguson's got everyone walking' on eggshells.
Were you thinkin' about it?
Nah, everyone else is.
You know we'd be right behind you if you did.
What'd you wanna ask me?
Can you have a chat to Allie?
About what?
We tried an intervention and it didn't go down very well.
Oh, well there's a surprise.
I'm worried about her.
I'm worried she's gonna OD or top herself or something.
What?
She gave me Bea's sketchbook.
She sounded like she was goin' away and not comin' back.
Oh shit, Liz, I'm not a grieve councillor.
I know, love, I know, but... just have a word to her and make sure she's not gonna do anything stupid.
Yeah, sure.
You know junkies, they'll tell you anything.
Oi.
You got a minute?
Sure.
Oh, well she shouldn't be.
She reckons you're tryin' to score drugs off Ferguson.
I'm not.
Where's the stash... hmm?
Is it here somewhere?
Give it back.
You've got enough fuckin' shit here
I know she didn't die so you could become a fuckin' junkie again!
I'm clean.
I've been stockpiling.
I just need one more hit and I'm ready.
Ferguson.
I'm gonna hotshot the bitch.
Fuck no!
I'm willing to take that risk.
What and you think Ferguson's just gonna stand there while you stick her with a needle?
I'll find a way.
Forget it!
Now, you flush it!
Ferguson is a fuckin' spider.
She's got eyes in the back of her head.
Now, you flush the shit or I will.
Fine.
You were never gonna get that close to her.
What do you want?
I need more of everything.
Already?
What, you think I sit on my arse all day like all you bosses?
Or maybe I need a supplier with bigger balls.
Or maybe you need a week in the slot to chill out.
I have an idea.
Yeah, Turk, it's me.
Cheers.
This has the potential to put Wentworth at the forefront of vocational training
I have already lined up a very generous benefactor.
And why are they interested in funding such an enterprise?
Is Ferguson behind this?
Certainly not, and I'm not seeking her approval.
Only yours.
Well, in principle I think it's an excellent idea, but I will need the approval of the Regional Manager if we want to expand it into a fully fledged industry.
Can't wait to tell the other women.
Organise some prisoners to clean this up.
What'll they think of next?
This is not a random act of vandalism.
We couldn't identify them from the CCTV.
They had their hoodies pulled up and their faces covered.
What about if that's how they were getting the drugs in?
Sanitary Bins?
Well, I've checked all the other supplies, nothing jumped out.
What if they torched the bins so we'd have to order urgent replacements?
Yeah, I s'pose it's possible.
Let's test my theory.
Fuck!
_
Sierra 6 to Sierra 3, they're coming out of the lift now.
Copy that Sierra 6.
_
We've spoken about it before, I don't want to talk about it.
So, that's...
Okay?
I gotta go.
Tina!
Back up, Mercado.
Take that... and the shiv.
On your rags, Mr Jackson?
But like all good partners, we compliment each other.
We just need the approval of the powers that be.
Yeah, we're gonna take over the world.
And, as a matter of fact, we've got, uh, a proposition to make to you, Liz,
We want you to come on-board as our Horticultural Expert.
We need a green thumb.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know...
Anderson...
Oh.
What do ya reckon that is?
Oh, it's probably her transfer knock-back.
Official paperwork's probably arrived.
_
Are you all right, lovey?
Dor, what happened?
Tomorrow!
Phones are now available for use.
Oh, some good news.
I made parole, and, oh, it's a bit of a shock but... they're releasing me tomorrow, and, uh...
Look, I really, really need to speak to you, so I'll, um...
I'll try again later, okay?
I love you both.
I heard you got parole.
You okay?
Wh... what would you care?
Is that so hard to believe?
Yeah.
I felt we had a special bond...
It's not true.
It's not true.
Don't you ever come near me again.
Count will commence in ten minutes.
Doyle... count's coming up, time to get home.
This'll never be home, Mr J.
Fair enough.
_
Some arsehole tipped them off.
Mercado was there waiting to pick up the delivery.
Well, at least you know one thing for sure.
What's that?
There is definitely a dodgy officer.
What the fuck just happened?
I just saved your arse is what just happened.
You let us walk into a shitstorm.
Who do you think called off the delivery?
There wasn't time.
I heard about the raid and had just enough time to call the supplier.
So now we are fucked again.
We'll just have to find another way.
Hey, pressie here
So, are you excited yet, darlin'?
Oh, it's all going by so fast,
Do you wanna know what the best thing about getting out is?
What?
Not shitting in your own bedroom!
Ohhh!
In your own house, with Nash and Joshy.
You and Nashy, like, goin' at it,
Now, listen... we're gonna have to make a toast and I volunteer Franky.
Why, is someone leaving'?
I love ya, Dors, we all do, and this place is way more bearable with you in it.
But we're gonna forgive you for leavin' us... because you belong on the outside with your other family.
Now, we're gonna miss ya heaps, but we will never forgive you if you fuck this chance up!
So, ladies, we are all gonna raise a toast to Dors...
No fuckin' up!
No fuckin' up!
Dor!
Love ya, Dors.
Oh, love... what's wrong?
I can't get ahold of Nash.
What, not at all?
I keep gettin' his voice-mail.
I don't even know if he's gotten the message.
I mean, we haven't even had a chance to make any plans.
Dor... you're free... and you have a family who love you... and everything is gonna be amazing.
Isn't it?
I love you, Doreen.
Yeah, I can't work out if I'm
Oh, I think it's all right to be both.
Yeah, then I'm both.
Just remember it's a happy day for Dor, that's...
Yeah.
Doreen!
Woo-hoo, Doreen!
Oh, sh... oh, shit, come here you big sook.
Oh, you can talk!
I know.
I don't want you to go.
Some bitch has ripped off my cash!
Was it a substantial amount?
A fuckload!
Ha!
Hey, I've got a psych appointment in ten minutes.
All right, come on then.
I'm so nervous.
God, do you remember how scared and messed up you were the first day you came here?
Oh... well, look at you now.
God, you're walkin' out of here a beautiful, strong, proud woman, Dor.
You know, not many of us can say that prison made us a better person, but you can.
Hey?
No more tears,
Time to go, Anderson.
No, not Dor, she got family.
Has anyone seen Franky?
_
Doreen, Doreen,
Doreen, Doreen, Doreen, Doreen, Doreen, Doreen,
Love ya!
Ow!
Joshy!
_
Doyle's waiting for her 3:00 o'clock appointment.
Sorry I'm late.
So, what have you stolen this time?
What, you want to check my pockets?
What I want is to stop having to cover for you.
What are you doing here?
Came to see you.
Yeah, I know.
And I believed you, again!
I'm not doing this anymore, Franky.
Look, I'm doin' it for us.
I won't do it again.
Get out!
Got enough money now.
So you have.
"Law of supply and demand", you said.
There's your fuckload of cash.
Where's my gear?
That's ten times the going rate!
Now, you've been holding out on me.
You've got something far more valuable to trade than someone else's money.
You said that I could have anything from your cell that I wanted.
Not that.
Warned you the price would be high.
Hmm.
No, please... don't burn it.
No, no, no, I won't.
You want the drugs, don't you?
Then you will burn it.
Page by page.
Let's go.
Wait!
Oh... fuck!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit!
Looks.
Out, bitch, it's Ferguson's time!
Come on, get out!
Leave her, she's nothing to worry about.
Look at you.
Worthless.
Nothing.
Oh... do you want to touch me?
Do you?
But you're filthy.
You're a filthy whore.
A little Top Dog whore.
You're just drawn to strong women, aren't you?
First Kaz and... then Bea, and now me.
Come on, get clean, huh?
You like to fly in our orbit, even if you burn your wings.
Little star-fucker!
If only Bea could see us now.
Ah-huh.
Ugh!
Do it!
Please!
So you can be with your Queen Bea.
Do it!
Please!
No.
There's no easy way out for you.
Ah, help!
When Bea came to kill me, I overpowered her too.
Hell no.
She threw herself on her own shiv.
She sacrificed herself so she could be with you.
But here you are, huh?
The love of your life just... died for nothing.
Oh, I'm sorry.
So sorry.
What the hell happened to you?
I was so close.
I had the needle in her neck but I stuffed it up.
How are you still alive?
Come here.
but she wouldn't do it.
She said Bea died for nothing.
Shhh.
I wanna die.
I got up on the roof today, to check it out.
I felt the breeze on my face.
I could see over the walls, to the horizon.
There was only one locked door between me and the outside.
Now, I'm gonna get out... and I'm gonna find out who killed Pennisi... and you're gonna come with me.
What?
Fuck this dying shit!
Now, you need to get out and you need to live a happy life.
That's the revenge you get on Ferguson.
Oh, you're serious.
