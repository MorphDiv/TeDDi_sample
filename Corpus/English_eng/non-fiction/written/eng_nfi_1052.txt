McKenzie:

Choose one of these trades and use it as inspiration for a marionette character.
- Whoa.

Awesome.
McKenzie:

And tonight the artists embark on an epic journey.
You up for a little adventure?

- Let's do it.

Guys, come on out!
- Oh, my God!

Yes!
Hey, you all right?
No.

The sculpt's reading as rock.
It doesn't look good in our favor.
This is impossible.
Application's becoming a nightmare.

This is "Face Off:

This is gorgeous.
So is anybody worried about getting eliminated soon?

- Yes, I'm a little concerned.

I'm really excited to get started.
We have had a few bottom looks, but the last challenge the judges received our marionette character well, and so I'm really going into this challenge with a refreshed enthusiasm.
So what do we think the challenge is gonna be?
Something in the woods maybe?
I mean, we could be going to the observatory.
I'm pretty familiar with Griffith Park.
There's the observatory.

Maybe we're going to one of those.
I don't know.
Hey, guys.
All:

- You up for a little adventure?

- Let's do it.

Good, because that's what we have in store for you this week.
In fantasy films, the best teams are often made up of the most unlikely of companions.
Memorable characters like Shrek and Donkey from the "Shrek" films and Legolas and Gimli from "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy find themselves working together, despite their different appearances and personalities, to accomplish incredible things.
So, with that in mind, your next Spotlight Challenge is to create a comedic fantasy duo fit to star in an epic adventure film.
That's cool.
- Comedy.

Okay.
This is a fantasy challenge.
So it's stuff that's really fun to make.
And then it's gonna be funny too, which I always like putting a little humor into our makeup.
Now, I have a little something to help ensure true diversity for this challenge.
Guys, come on out!
Oh, my God!
Yes!

All of the models come out, and they're wearing ridiculously shaped suits.
I am getting so excited.
I love this.

Oh, my God.
Quit rubbing it.

As you can see, each of our lovely models is wearing a unique bodysuit.
But what you can't see is that they've also been preassigned a fantasy race.
Oh.
- Oh, cool.

All right, each team will choose one male and one female character.
George and Cig go ahead and choose your first character.
One, two, three...
All right, dwarf.
Emily and Tyler, you're next.
A goblin.
- Orc.

The fairy.
Ogre.
The faun.
The naiad.
The Minotaur, please.
The troll.
- Come on.

[laughter]
- Yay.

All right, guys, remember, another team will be eliminated this week, so please make sure to wow the judges.
All right, I'm gonna leave you here with your models to work on your designs.
When you're done, head back to the lab and get to work.
Good luck, guys.
- Thank you.

Bye.
[lively music] [indistinct chatter]
You're, like, an old married couple.
- But he's young.

- You're old.

You guys are trying to go on a Middle-earth vacation.
Our wood elf character is gonna be sort of the older, fun-loving new-lease-on-life character.
And then she'll also have a beehive hairdo, which will be an actual beehive.
And the Minotaur will be her beefcake trophy companion.
I want the beehive thing to look realistic, but not, like, super cheesy.
And we really love comedy.
So we just feel like this is right up our alley.
I think we're over our slump, and we're back to fresh Ben and Evan.
Funky fresh.
Funky fresh. [Laughter]
- You guys feeling it?

I think it sounds great.
Why are they together?
What brought them together?
Maybe their races are becoming extinct, so they're negotiating their territory.
Yeah, that works.
These two characters meet on a quest.
And our goblin is just this sneaky cave dweller.
And our faun is this very gentle, kind character that is being manipulated by the goblin to lead her towards the castle.
So she's, like, the greedy...
And then he's more like...

Yes.

I think the proportions that look good are the tapering top of the head, big traps, big forehead, and shrunken face.
I think Adam and I are having a tough time rebounding from our critiques from last challenge.
So it's a rough start, but it's really nice to have the models there in the suits because we can get an idea of what the end product's gonna look like.
The orc is kind of dumb and brutish.
And she can be full of knowledge, but not as physically capable, so they make a good pair.
So our orc is sort of like a dopey, construction-worker-trope character.
And the naiad is aquatic, so we want to make her fun-loving, book-smart, merfolk character.
We don't want to go a direct fish route with her, but we do want to incorporate some water and fin-like features.
And I thought if they find a baby dragon egg and they want to return it...
She stops him from cooking the egg.
She's a little spitfire, and he's just...
- Uh-huh?

- Yeah.

There's gonna be a stark contrast, so, yeah, she needs to be fiery.
We have Grizzlemaw, the dwarf, and she's just this lonely old lady that never had any kids.
- "I don't need nobody!"

But in her old age, she just wants to see the world.
Maybe, like, she was traveling, and he was getting picked on by other ogres, and she saw it, and she defended him, and then they... then he just kind of follows her around like a lost puppy.
That's fun.
Our dwarf character, Grizzlemaw, meets Mutton, who's our ogre.
And he's just big and fat and stupid.
But, like, you can't help but love him.
I definitely want to incorporate a heavy, wrinkly, textured skin on her.
We were thinking, like, a married couple.
- [chuckles]

And I'm thinking that you're going on a vacation and you kind of stumble into an adventure.
Our characters are a married couple that are going on their 800th wedding anniversary in the human world.
And we want to play that up.
So she's the one that makes the itinerary.
And he's the one that's like, "I'll get the check."
She was, you know, a beautiful fairy at one point, and then she kind of let herself go.
Keaghlan really wants to work on the fairy.
She's really into bright colors and that sort of whimsy thing.
And I'm like, "That'll work perfect."
I really want to do ugly and grotesque, so I'll take the troll.
So we're happy campers.

All right, guys, let's get to work!
Let's head to the lab.

How do you feel about throwing silicone on these?
Cig is gonna take point on the ogre.
And I'm gonna take point on the dwarf.
I love doing realistic silicone makeups.
So I'm gonna use this opportunity to showcase something that I think I'm halfway decent at.
I'm liking this already.

As I'm sculpting the face,
I'm making it thin in certain areas so that it moves better and thick in other areas so we really get that dwarf look.
"Not beans, I like mutton."

I like that schnoz.
How you feeling about yours?
I want to, like, keep her pretty but then old.
Yeah.
I'm designing the fairy character.
And the body's already been addressed by the bodysuit.
Since I have this opportunity, I'm gonna take my time and do beautiful old-age makeup.
I'm working on the nose, and initially I sculpt it in a pixie form.
But I'm not necessarily sure that's gonna work for me because we also want to make them look realistic.
I would make the nose a little bit more pointed.
'Cause I think that right now it's reading as dwarfish.
Since she's excited about the idea, then it cements my decision to go full fantasy and do a pixie nose.
Yeah, I like that much better.
♪ ♪
Are you molding both of these today?
- Yeah.

So we're gonna be fabricating on top.
There's hair on them and everything.
And veining and all this stuff.

We have to get two cowls out today.
We have to lay hair on the one cowl, and we have to pre-paint the other one.
So it's a lot of work, but we got to get it done.
I'm gonna try to sculpt his face today...
- Okay.

Because the faun's cowl doesn't have to be too intricate because we're covering it with hair, we want to incorporate very simple forms...
Having the ears turned down to give the sense that this character is sad.
And we really want to keep the horns short and stubby because it just looks more cute that way.
[electronic music]
Make the face fatter to go with this.
Like, do a rounded face.
The orc sculpture is really consistent with the bodysuit that we have.
Because the bodysuit has such a tremendous belly, he'll have this gigantic head and set of shoulders with a really tiny face and a big jaw, which means we have a lot of clay to put down today.
I would try to incorporate some... pond foliage form here.
Adam and I are still working on exactly how the cowl for the naiad's gonna work out.
Now, it's more important that Adam's cowl gets molded by the end of the day because it needs to be actually fabricated on tomorrow.
So there's a tremendous amount of work in a short period of time.
For the wood elf character's beehive hairdo,
I'm sculpting a beehive into the cowl, but it's taking too long, and I don't like it.
Why are we making this a cowl?
I'm having a hard time justifying all this work.
I already wasted a lot of time trying to make the cowl.
So now I'm not sure how to make it work.
I think this is gonna end up just looking real silly and, like, not in, like, in the way we want?
- Not an organic kind of thing?

- I agree.

I am kind of frustrated.
We can't get a win.

And if we don't have a clear vision of what we want to do and we are not able to pull it off, our chances of getting eliminated are very high.
[dramatic music]
For the wood elf character's beehive hairdo,
I'm sculpting the beehive into the cowl, but it's taking too long, and I don't like it.
I feel like this is gonna end up just looking real silly and, like, not in, like, in the way we want?
- Not an organic kind of thing?

- I agree.

It's too much work for how simple it is.
So it's more important for Ben to focus on sculpting a really good old-age makeup.
And we can do this beehive tomorrow.
[electronic music]
- Tyler, this one's done.

We get into the mold room, and we have to mold these two cowls as fast as we can.
Tyler, where would you do this?
- Hmm?

Why?
I feel like you're a better mold-maker than me.
So Tyler helps me with the division wall, 'cause he knows that if I do it, it's gonna lock or, like, something will happen.
And Tyler will never let me mold again.
If we double-team, like, one person gets one side, the other one gets the other...
- Yeah.

The struggle is real.
We can get these done.

Mm-hmm.

- Hi, everybody.

- Hello.

This is our dwarf woman.
And she's a crotchety, old grandma.
And she happened upon this guy, who now follows her around like a lost puppy.
I really like the way it's coming around.
I just think you need to push it little bit more for an ogre.
- Mm-hmm.

Now, let's take a look at your woman.
The little eyelids you have going on there,
I'd do a little stretch and stipple on them.
- Stretch and stipple?

We were talking about maybe giving her a bit of a receding hairline.
It would be nice to be able to take it back beyond where you think you're gonna put your wig...
- Yeah.

Now, it looks like you have the Minotaur and...
- Minotaur.

- Wood elf, yeah.

I don't think it would hurt if you made a ridge that's maybe only that big.

And what are you gonna do with the face?
In the realm of a cow?
- More bovine.

Okay.

And then with our old lady...
I know elves have more of a human look to 'em, but I kind of want to add some pointy features.
I think you could even go a little bit more...
A little more?
'Cause if you do that, it might start turning witchy.
You got a great nose going on.

How are you approaching this now?
- With speed.

I think you can even push it further.
There's a lot of human in there, between cheekbones and this coming out.
I would advise not being afraid of really going for more orc, because it's gonna play really well with the softness and the beauty of your sea nymph.
Let's see your naiad.
Now, what are you gonna do here?
So, for the cowl, doing this fin work.
She'll have hair over it.
So, if you really wanted to sell the idea, this could be a larger gill that comes out and down and around there.
Our fairy and troll are married.
They go out to the human world for a vacation.
I like the little round chin.
And you might, with the upper lip here, do a little more cracking, because right now it has a very youthful type of a look to it.
Mm-hmm.

And you want...

- Mm-hmm.

And the reverse over here.
- Exactly.

- Going down.

And what you've done here, too, is you've taken the basic skull shape away, which is nice.
You've given a little Neanderthal in here to balance out your big nose coming down.
It looks good.
- Bye, everybody.

- Thank you.

[electronic music]
She's a golden girl. [Laughs]
I want it to be, like, the characters go out onstage, and it's immediately understandable that it's a comedy.
Traditionally, trolls turn to stone when they're exposed to sunlight.
So I start adding some rocklike texture on the nose, because our husband and wife team are taking a vacation in Hawaii of all places, so...
The places where you would sunburn are starting to turn to rock.

I feel like the sculpt's reading as rock.
Either way, it reads as a really fun texture.

No, it's still hot.
We're running out of time before the end of the day, and Adam and I have already spent a great deal of time in the mold room just trying to get these things done so we can focus on the fabrication tomorrow.
But, unfortunately, we both won't get our molds done, and Adam's pretty frustrated at that fact.
- Hey.

I don't have any, like...

Now, having not put that much detail into that cowl sculpture, he feels like it was a waste of his time.
Moving as fast as we could.
We'll run it in foam, anyway, tomorrow night.
All right, guys, it's time!
It's frustrating that our game plan didn't go accordingly.
That means I have to do a slip cast, fabricate all the pieces separate, and then assemble an application.
So, in order to fabricate on this,
I'm gonna have to run poly foam and latex.
The only problem is, that's eating into the time that I wanted to fabricate.
So we're behind more than we're ahead.

You know, I've never really sculpted animal faces like this.
And the focal point of this makeup is gonna be the snout and the eyes, but the snout...

- Looks pretty good.

Just fill out that edge right in that crease.
Okay, okay, cool.
Our model has a really good bottom lip, and I don't want to cover that up.
So what I do is I just leave it exposed, and the way the snout looks, it matches up with his natural lip, so...

This cowl is still in two separate pieces.
We're now behind, and it's frustrating, because this is a challenge that's not going to rely on the quality of one character.
It's both characters.
And it's not gonna be the product that I want it to be.
It's looking good, though.
So there's that. [Chuckles]
I do understand the frustration very much, but we have to finish these things.
If we can do a smaller thing tomorrow maybe?

I didn't even realize that was a beehive on her head until I got really close.
Unfortunately, from a distance, none of it reads like that, which is kind of a shame.
But I think the Minotaur is fantastic.
I especially like the little addition of where his horn broke off and you stuck that back on there with that bracket.
- Good job, guys.

One of the things I love about the bull, in particular, is it doesn't feel like it's a sculpture around an actor's eyes.
It feels integrated.
And all the design ideas are really great.
Ben and Evan, please step back.
- Thank you.

Good job.
Good job.

Oof.
Please tell us how you used your bodysuits in the creation of your fantasy couple.
The bodysuit for our dwarf was really, like, saggy.
There was a lot of weight.
So we wanted to do more of like an age makeup.
And our ogre was about the same.
We had this big belly, so we had to do something with it.
I got to say that the old-age on your dwarf is pretty darn special, guys.
Thanks.
I think it's probably one of the best use of silicone we've ever seen on the show.

As far as your ogre goes, I noticed that you even used silicone on his stomach...

Which is kind of cool because it looks really great.
Your dwarf is... just the most sublime embodiment of a fantasy dwarf.
You've done such a good job of making it feel organic and gave me a laugh.
Magnificent.
- Thank you so much.

The biggest success you could have in this particular challenge is all about working with the proportions of the bodysuits that you were given.
You could not have done that better.

- Keaghlan, Melissa...

Tell us about your undersuit-inspired characters.
The usual fairy you see is, you know, slender and beautiful and pristine.
But I wanted to make her look older, and then...
Well, our troll has a big belly, and so we also went the old-age route, like things are starting to sag.
But also, it really suited his troll-ness.
The fairy feels very chalky and flat and one-dimensional.
♪ ♪
The troll...

And that part feels a little bit inconsistent with the weight and the fleshiness that surrounds it.
On the fairy, you failed to capitalize on the canvas.
And her weird skin tone and colored eyebrows do not a fairy make.
I understand what you were going for, but it would have been a lot simpler to just make her look a little pudgy and not make her look old.
And then you tried to paint her purple on top of it, which was a big boo-boo.
Keaghlan and Melissa, please head back.

Tell us about your concept.
She's this cave-dwelling goblin.
And she's out to steal the king's crown.
She meets this faun.
And so they're on this journey, and because he's half-goat, he eats part of the map, and that's where they're at.
The faun is absolutely stunning.
Yes. [Giggles]
His face is so compelling.
And the goblin character...
I really like the colors, and there's a lot of detailed breakup.
And that's why it's successful this week.
Great work, guys.

I think your faun, by far, is my favorite character out here tonight.
He's so big, and he's so fabulous.
I want to take him home.
I need a pet.

Good evening, guys.

Tell us how your bodysuits influenced your character design.
The orc character, we went more towards the animated route.
And for the naiad, she had enhanced breasts and enhanced buttocks, so that immediately read a bustle to me.
Your aquatic character could have been really gorgeous, but she's a little too silly.
She didn't even have to be all that kind of kooky.
And why would she be wearing glasses anyway?
You know, she lives in a pond.
I do think the orc is pretty fantastic.
The forms on your naiad feel superfluous and arbitrary.
And the orc...

It's just they're not of the same production design world.
The naiad feels very underdeveloped to me.
I think there's a really cool idea here, but so wish you would have gotten rid of the goofy glasses and then did a makeup around her eyes.
The orc, on the other hand, is one of the most successful in taking the proportions of the bodysuit that you were given so that it looks like one unified element.
Thank you.
Logan and Adam, please step back.

All right, guys, if you'll please head back to the makeup room while the judges deliberate.
- Thank you.

- Thanks, guys.

All right, judges, so let's talk about tonight's makeups.
Why don't we start with Ben and Evan?
I thought the Minotaur was fantastic, but the wood elf just didn't feel like it met the challenge.
It's not elf-y in any way, shape, or form other than pointed ears.
But the Minotaur was superb.
It really was, sculpturally, conceptually, paint-wise.
Right down to the moistness around the nose, the broken tip on the horn, which was a really clever idea.
All right, let's move on to Cig and George.
This is the best silicone appliance we've seen on the show.
But more important than any of that, the proportions themselves created the comedy.
And then they focused on just creating really great makeups that were a little bit more serious.
It was a perfect balance.
These guys are known to do things that are comedic.
And to be given the latitude to do comedy and show restraint, that, to me, was their greatest choice.
All right, let's move on to Emily and Tyler.
I love the faun.
It was fantastic.
I loved the paint job and the hair work and everything on that character.
The compassionate, emotive nature makes it so stunning.
What they did was harmonize the buddy characters.
Both of them work so well together as a team.
Okay, let's move on to Keaghlan and Melissa.
The fairy, for me, just failed miserably to take into consideration the proportions of the bodysuit and do anything interesting with it.
If you're gonna paint it lavender, don't do it all one color lavender.
It was flat, and she looked like a lavender mummy, and that is not funny.
Although I did like elements of the blacksmith from last week, they have not been moving forward creatively and successfully.
And lastly, Logan and Adam.
I'm not real happy with Adam's naiad.
He could have made her look a lot more whimsical by doing a beautiful makeup.
And she still could have been fun, especially working opposite him.
Even though I'm not thrilled with naiad, it's a big step up from where they were last week, with the stone mason.
These haven't been their greatest weeks, but they're getting better and better as we go.
All right, then, judges, have you made your decisions?
- Yes, we have.
