My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,
I was accidentally thrust into the future, and I saw him murder the woman I love.
But I won't let that happen.
I'm going to do everything in my power to change the future, and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.
I am The Flash.
Previously on The Flash...
When I threw the Philosopher's Stone into the Speed Force, I accidentally ran into the future.
I saw Savitar murder you.
I wasn't fast enough to save you.
We can't do this alone, Barry.
Why don't you come work with us?
You can help Team Flash fight meta-humans.
- Welcome to the team.

If his powers are linked to the energy that ties together the multiverse...
He can open a breach to any Earth he wants.

How do you want to do this?
"Westworld" style, back to back, ten paces, turn and shoot?

Cisco can hold his own.
Hmm.

Barry, we can't let this happen.
What if he can't defeat her?
I can't interfere again.
If I do, then we forfeit.

At this rate, Cisco's gonna be the dead man.
