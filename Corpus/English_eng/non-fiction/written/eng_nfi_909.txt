CBS presents a live televised musical event,
"Sunday in the Park with George,"
starring the cast of "The Big Bang Theory"!
- Resist!

- Stop this abomination!

- Fuck you, Bazinga!

20 hours of community service is ridiculous for what we did.
If we hadn't stormed that stage, people could have thought that it reflected
- Sondheim's intentions!

How do you think Boy George got through it?
Poppers...

I need to make my annual insurance-less pilgrimage to the old therapist at my college clinic.
You still go to the free student clinic for antidepressants?
Ever since I gained my Freshman 1,500.
You know, when Josh Gad optioned my article,
I thought I had a chance at real medical care.
But then that fell through, and now I need my increase before the holiday.
Ah, yes...

SSRis are like my own chemical Moses, getting me through a family Seder.
Hey!
Do you two outside janitors know where the Trump statue is?
Yeah, sure, and we'd love to tell you.
What you're gonna wanna do is just...
"I waited over an hour for my food"
"but got no help from the elderly gay man with stubble"
"or the unhinged blond"
"with a lot to say about Area 51."
Fucking transphobic Yelp reviewer!
Look, now that there's a sound stage in the neighborhood, daytime TV producers want their food fast.
Oh, God forbid Wendy Williams or Maury's assistant
- needs to wait for their eggs.

It's called the Nine-Minute Lunch.
I think I got one of those in the bathroom of the Phoenix once.
- Ugh!

Look, lunch will be on the table in nine minutes, or it's free.
Well, this is the worst day ever.
Why?

Leave that bisexual octogenarian alone.
My parents are dead!
- My God, are you okay?

Is that them in those urns?
No, I'm not okay.
They were murdered at Dollywood, and these are just two-for-one vases I got on sale.
Even in my darkest hour, I can't pass up a bargain.
Honey, are you sure you wanna be at work today?
Probably not.

- of bareback.

I swear, if I have to hear one more cis person complain about their life, I'm gonna kill myself!
Matthew, I know we're not friends or anything.
I know we don't even like each other.
But... my parents died too, so if you ever need to...
Monologue?

'Twas a Tuesday, so naturally
Meemaw and Peepaw were down at Dollywood.
Well, there was one last funnel cake at the Lil' Loggers Landing ride, and my parents died in the shootout.
I-I'm sorry.

Yes.
Tennessee is a mandatory carry state.
And now I have to go down there to identify the funnel cake!
Does anybody have a gun I can borrow?
Oh, hey, okay, come on.
Come on.

Oh, my real baby's crying.
- Hey!

- Hi.

Like I said,
I know we're not friends or anything, but...
- Yeah...

Depression... it follows you everywhere like a shadow.
Ridshadovan treats moderate-to-severe depression.
Call your doctor if you're experiencing suicidal thoughts that are dissimilar to the suicidal thoughts you usually experience day-to-day.
♪ In the dark... ♪
Hey, Mom, have you heard of Ridshadovan?
Heard of them?

Now that I've had my house renovated,
I want everything to look perfect.
Speaking of that, what are you wearing to the Seder?
I have some notes about last year's outfit.
I'm an adult.

You also don't dress for your complexion.
Okay, here's who's coming, and here's what not to talk to them about.
The ACLU.
Women.
And as for that angel of death herself, Aunt Bonnie...
Oh, shit.

Her on-again cocaine addiction.
Ugh!

God, I hate that fuckin' bitch!
Me too.

Moving on.

Arthur.
- Arthur's drinking.

Yes.

Just a... 17-year-old college student.
See you girls at the quad later.
We can talk about vampire novels!
Listen, here's why I'm here.
My serotonin is in the serotoilet, and I'm gonna need you to kick my meds up a notch.
Oh.
Let's see what you're currently taking.
Uh... they still make that?

Yikes!
Oh, yoy, yoy.

- Skimming.

Can we add a splash of that mixer to the cocktail?
- What do you think?

They sent me a fanny pack and a whoopee cushion.
Sounds legit!
It's, uh, Kessler.
K-e-s-s-l-e-r.
Hello!
Oh, my God, she's dead.
She died right in front of me.
I just want the pad...
Fuckin' rigor mortis setting in already!
Why does everything bad always happen to me?
Have a nice day!
♪ Can you find me ♪
♪ In the dark?

This is what's called a grab-bag call.
It's one audition that we can apply to hundreds of opportunities.
There's so much content now, individual auditions are just not practical.
Yeah.

are now saying, "There are too many shows!"
I-I'm sorry.
So I do this one audition, and then I'm eligible for what?
Well, let's see what's on the menu today.
Oh, a recurring on a Seeso crime procedural.
- Seeso?

Uh, late-night warm-up comic.
Kevin James's brother.
Oh, sperm donor to my sister who's gonna be my surrogate once she pays her dog's ransom.
You kidnapped your sister's dog?
I kidnapped my sister's dog.
I need her to be my surrogate.
You know how many kids she has?
Three.

Minus two.
So I'll be Charla, you be Dave, and, uh, let's just have fun with it.
"Dave, wow..."
"I thought you'd never come visit me in the hospital."
I'm leaving you.
FUCK YOU!
Hi.

- Sandwiches or health care?

She's seeing the psychopharmacologist.
Yeah.

- to see a doctor for free.

White, please, 8-inch, turkey ranch, and Swiss.

- Sounds good.

Well ever since Trump replaced the Department of Health with Jenny McCarthy's blog, nothing makes sense.
Doctors have to do whatever they can to earn a living.
Um, the doctor's ready for you now.
- Thanks.

- Hi.

Uh...

I assume you're here to wean yourself off the toxic levels of psychotropic meds in your body?
Wait... what?

I'm here for more antidepressants.
You see, Passover is coming, like winter on "Game of Thrones," I assume, and I need more drugs so I can survive my family during the holidays.
If I give you more antidepressants, you'll die.
Your blood is technically a foam.
So...

You're not gonna give me any more drugs?
No.
Fuck you!
Heller?
Good afternoont!
Billy Epstein?

- You booked a role!

First I need to read you the roles you did not get, starting alphabetically.
AMA Awards Red Carpet Host,
Annette Bening's butt double...
Can you just tell me which one I got?
Interesting way of gathering information, but okay, I'll bite.
Larry Wilmore has a new late-night talk show, and you're the warm-up comic for his studio audience!
Okay!

Um... but I-I'm sorry.

Extended Release, how was the doctor?
Horrible.

- But it's Passover.

How am I supposed to get through Seder without my little helper?
How'd you know I was going out of town?
No, no, no, I meant little helper, like slang for drugs.
Like black beauties or Imagine Dragons.
Or bennies.

Dexies.

Uppers, downers, East Enders, skins,
Winonas, Puerto Rican French fries,
Liza with a Zs, ludes,
Crude ludes with attitudes...
You're going out of town?
- I just found out.

I haven't had to sit through a family Seder by myself since I was a witch in college.

And I love being your human shield, but due to budget cuts,
PBS had to relocate all our productions.
Please tell me you're not going to L. A.
I wish!

No, from here on in, we're shooting everything at Burt Reynolds' old dinner theater in Jupiter, Florida.
Oh, Jesus, Arthur!
Why is this happening?
I'll be back before you know it, and Billy will be at the Seder.
- Hey.

I'm warming up for Larry Wilmore, and I can't come to Seder.
Oh, fuck!
Wait, which is which?
Thanks for volunteering here at the Children's Hospital.
Well, it was mandatory, part of our community service requirement.
But it's nice to finally have a pair of shoes that fits me.
You're gonna brighten up some lives!
These kids are at an age where they don't know yet to be scared of clowns.
I want a clown name, you know, just a big, goofy, harmless clown, someone who doesn't upset anybody, totally unmemorable, no edge.
Hey, kid, I'm Go-Go!
- And I'm Mario Lopez.

So do you have any jokes?
Maybe we can read you some of our tweets.
- Oh, that's a good idea.

Those are already out there.
Yeah, exactly.

- Uh... no.

Oh, here's one.

Here's one about the guy who played Elmo.
Oh, no, no.

Hey, kid, um... how long did the doctor give you to live?
I have a broken leg.
From the cancer?
No.

You're not dying?

Well, fuck this!
- Ooh, chocolates.

Yeah.

Are you clowns gonna do anything?
I'll sign your fucking cast.
You know what we can do to fill the time?
- Hmm?

Okay.

My mom goes to our Sausalito house sometimes to meditate with Oprah.
- Oh, shut up, Baby Warbucks.

Meditation, though?
That's just napping, right?

You need to get yourself one of those meditation apps.
That way, you can be one of those people who feels superior to other people
- because you meditate.

Great news, kid...

Bad news...

Look!

No.

17.99?

You still owe me 10 bucks for "Inland Empire."
No.

Hey, it's me, Danny Aiello.
- Are you ready to meditate?

What a coincidence.

Okay, pally, do me a favor and get yourself in a comfortable position and take some deep breaths.
There you go.
And now, we are back.
How do you feel?
Pretty relaxed, huh?

Now you're all meditated, with me, Danny Aiello.
Bye!
Happy Passover, Mom.
Julie, why are you late?
You know, it's funny.

And I've been losing money too.

- As a mental health profession...

Your father is stuck on the BQE with a fruit platter.
I told him to put Waze on the phone.
He says, "No.

What's he doing on his phone, making documentaries?
Oh, fuck.
Hi, Aunt Bonnie!
Hi, Julie.
Marilyn.
Hello, Bonnie.
You're looking very well.
It's natural to expect a little weight gain, considering all the damage the cocaine's done to your metabolism.
Oh, don't worry.

- You remember sex, Marilyn.

You never forget your little sister's first paying job.
Oh, you dirty bitch.
Hey, come on, Lola,
I got two potato chip sandwiches up for table three.
I know Billy's at his stupid new job, but where the fuck is Matthew?
Matthew.

And you look like Sal Mineo went to a Hot Topic right before he was murdered.
Uh, so?

So I don't gotta do nothin' nobody says.
I had candy for breakfast this morning.
I don't even give a care!
Is this about you losing your parents?
That happened on Tuesday.
You're milking this like it had titties!
And, yeah, as a transwoman,
I can engage in provocative biological discourse.
This is insane!

Like, where is my cold cut and grape salad?
All right, all right.

Mattman.
Mattman, we know you're upset, but we need you to help out.
Do you think you could wait some tables?
You're not my father!
Oh, my God.
What are we supposed to do about our out-of-control teen?
Excuse me.
I've waited more than ten minutes for my carrot wrapped in salami, so I guess that means I get a free meal.
Hey, Facebook Live, it's Billy.
I am coming to you from the set of my new...
Oh, 'scuse me...

I am doing comedy for one of the funniest Larrys of all time.

Not even Miller.

Wilmore!

- Yes, I am.

I'm Billy.

I was a huge fan of "The Nightly Show," I really was.
Yeah, well, this is a little different.
I'm doing everything the network tells me to do for those high ratings.

Let me tell you what America loves on TV.
Party games with celebrities, and interviews with precocious little kids by black men over 40.
You're right.

Bill Cosby.
- Bill Cosby?

"the darndest things"...
You think drugging women and having sex with them while they're asleep is a...

- It's not not the darndest.

Why don't we leave Larry alone for a sec.
- Sure, yeah.

Oh, my God, I can't believe this.
Two days ago, I was serving mozzarella sticks, and now I am rifting with Larry Wilmore!
This is crazy!

Do I do my stand-up right at the top?
Because I have a tight 15 minutes about a loose Kevin Spacey.
Hey, don't worry about your "stand-up."
Your job is to psych up those people.
Come over here, clown.
Look at this.

This is a CD.

This is a cannon that shoots out T-shirts.
- Okay.

- Guess where they go?

In the cannon.

These are snacks for those animals up there.
And these are the two most important things.
This is the prank call templates, and these are the clapter suggestions.
I'm sorry... "clapter"?
Clapter.

That way, at least you get applause.
Oh.

Don't riff!
Welcome to Seder, everybody.
Happy Passover!
Happy Passover.
- Happy Passover.

So glad I could be here from the other promised land...
Jupiter, Florida.
What was that?
Since I landed in Florida, there's been a steady stream of gunfire and explosions.
Judi... viewers...

Is he really doing that, or am I just detoxing?
- Both.

Can you hear...
Can we please start the Seder?
The sooner we start, the sooner we get to eat.
Oh, Julie, please, just eat.
I mean, who could blame you for stuffing your face when you got a mess of a mother like that?
Don't you tell me why my daughter overeats.
I'll tell you why my daughter overeats.
- Impulse control.

- That's right.

Everything about her is screaming, "Look at me!"
- "Look at me!"

- Denial.

The only kids you know are the ones you've blown!
Seacrest out.
What's going on with Mattman?
Well, Maury,
Matthew used to be the sweetest boy.
But, you know, this last one day has just been a nightmare.
- Aw!

Mattman, come on out!
You don't know me!
You don't know me!

You can't handle all this!
- Sit down, sit down.

Mattman, you think it's neat to be rude?
- It's not neat.

I don't got parents no more, so I decide what the fuck to do, what the fuck I want.
Oh... boo!
Denise, you wanna tell him something?
Matthew... yes... there's an addition to our family.
There's a new ingénue, but you will always be my Broadway baby.
Aw!
You gotta think about the 1989 revival of "Gypsy."
Yes, Linda Lavin was a great replacement, but Tyne Daley is on the cast album, right?
Thank you for putting it in my terms.
- I'm gonna kill that baby.

Uh... okay, party people.
How 'bout a prank phone call?
It's just gonna go to voice mail.
No one picks up their phone anymore.
- What's up with the crowd, man?

I didn't just play beer pong with Joan Didion.
That segment was terrific.

Yeah, all right, whatever.

Oh, fuck.
God, they hate me.
Uh... all right, time for some clapter.
Uh...
Okay, guys, so, um, you know, Osama Bin Laden is still dead.
And, uh, let me just ask you.
How many of you here hate AIDS?
And now the easiest clapter of all... give it up for Larry Wilmore!
You know, it's great that Larry has a new show, because nobody watched his old show.
Oh... ha ha.

Right?

Unfortunately, he kept it at 100 viewers.
You used my own... words to slam me?
He's using my words to slam me.
Uh, Hey, Larry, will more people watch your new show?
I'm gonna fucking kill that guy.
Relax.

- Yes.

This next segment is bulletproof.
You talk to a kid.

- I got it, I got it.

All right, we're back in three, two...
Hey, all right.
This next totally original segment is called Little Kids Say Dumb Things to Big shot Larry.
So everybody please help me welcome Mikey Blazina!
Hey, how's it going?
Oh, fuck.
Hey, Mario Lopez!
Check it out, audience.
He's already saying some dumb shit.
That clown wrote on my leg cast that I was gay, so the kids at school beat me up, and now I have this arm cast!
Who, the "not funny T-shirt giving out motherfucker"
- over there?

"Bazinga in the Park with George"!
- OH!

Tell the set medic to leave the premises with Joan Didion's frozen finger.
I want this piece of shit to bleed to death while I punch his teeth out.
Ohh!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
You want a T-shirt?

Okay, pally, do me a solid.
Ask yourself... what are you afraid of?
- My mother.

- of your happiness?

Well, I got news for you, friendo.
You gotta become the thing that's getting in your way.
But I'm afraid of becoming my mother.
It's time to swim through the pain.
Now, I don't know how to swim.
Marty Scorsese said that's why he never cast me in any of his movies.
But I know he was lying.
What does he fuckin' make,
Esther Williams movies?
Now... that you're good and relaxed, write down my routing number.
- Hey.

I saw you duck in here, all stressed out.
Now, come on.
Give your Aunt Bonnie a nice, fat line of that tasty kosher for Passover booger sugar.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You can't get through one meal without drugs?
Your mother drove me to it.
I get it.

But... you know what?

We already opened the door for Elijah.
- Where were you, Julie?

By the way, dear, I had some notes about the blouse you chose to wear tonight.
I'm concerned it's not the most flattering to your... bra fat area.
I'm an adult.

What's that?

Lorna, would you pass whatever food is in front of you?
Please be careful.

Try to exercise some impulse control.
I'm sorry.
God, I'm the worst.
What are you two, "Freaky Fridaying"?
You know...

And on that note, so ends another Passover.
Oh, by the way, your friend in the computer needs help.
Wait a minute.
It's over?

Mom, Danny Aiello was my Passover Bump!
Aah!
She's found me!

- Who the hell are you?

Damn it, Flipper, I told you to text me when you were around the corner.
Bonnie, is that your drug dealer that you invited here?
No.

Bullshit!

Probably.

You want my pager number?
Get the fuck outta here.

- Come on.

I'm sorry the holidays have to be so difficult.
Me too.

Aunt Bonnie is a total waste of space.
A true human dumpster.
Wanna finish those macaroons?
- I sure do.

If a couple of guys show up asking for me...
Javier and his cousin Carlos, both about 19... tell them to meet me at the Days Inn near JFK and bring the poppers but forget the rubbers.
Happy Passover.
Never brag on social media about a job you haven't started yet.
What are our fake friends saying online?
"Hey, asshole, I hear your new job's a hit."
"In the face.

How 'bout you?

No, I don't think so.

But then I was going through my bank statement, and I realized I was hypnotized into sending Danny Aiello nearly $700.
Ugh!

At least after this, our community service is over.
In the middle of fuckin' nowhere.
"Big Fuckin' Bang!"
- Hey!

Hey!
- Fuck you!

- "Big Bang" piece of shit!
