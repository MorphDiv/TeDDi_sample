Previously on Wynonna Earp...
- You're injured.

I have to find this psycho named Tucker.-

That little Tucker is dead.
Wynonna's pregnant.
- You're...

Everything's changed.
Wanted you to hear it from me.
Give her this.
It always comes back to the Curse, Waves, always.
I wasn't the heir.
You're not even an Earp.
The Seven are gone.
Just like that?
Marshals!

Tucker Gardner, we're here for you,
- you little skidmark.

Help!
I'm gonna go.
Wynonna?
Thank God you came!

You don't have him?
Great police work, just stellar.
I'm sorry, I'ml'm...
I'm just really freaked out and, um, angry.
I'll check the bedrooms.
The last thing we remember, we passed out, and then we woke up locked in this room.
While you say you were asleep,
Pervert Gardner Junior kidnapped a girl and held her in my sister's bedroom.
I wish I could say I didn't know it was just a matter of time.
Tucker's out of his tree.

So you two don't happen to know a couple of bitches who like to get their Halloween on in creepy, black dresses?
Umm, no idea what you're talking about.
You sure you're not just hormonal?
Mazel Tov.
We've been locked in here for days.
We're victims, just like everyone else!
- Everyone?

She doesn't need a back rub.
We need you to get your ass in gear and find Tucker.

We'll be watching the house 247.
You're watching us?

It's for your protection.
Yeah, just in case he comes back.
- If you have nothing to hide, what's the problem?

I thought you of all people would get that.
Nah, sorry.
I don't have time to play nice anymore.
Here's our card.
Let us know if you... see him.
What is it?
I don't know for sure yet, but I feel it in my gut.
Don't look at my gut.
Sorry...
Have you seen a doctor or...?
Mercedes wasn't Mercedes!
Usually, she's a fun bitch, not a bitch bitch, which is like "Whoa, bitch," but...
It's a bitch thing.

Tucker had Hypnos put the town to sleep for the Widows.
Are the Gardner sisters working for them too?
I don't have the resources to monitor this place 247, but I've learned to trust your instincts.
Well, I hope so 'cause not being able to trust anyone ever, it's just...
Super lonely.
Yeah, I feel you, bitch.
You can't say that, that's our...
Ooh!
Head rush.
Hey, you alright?

I just need a yogurt, stat.
OK.

Hey, Doc.
We got a Code Rainbow.
We should have claimed new faces when we had the chance.
She knows it was us.
She was checking my arm.
If she'd touched me, I would have screamed.
We should go.
The Gardners disappear from Purgatory, they'll be even more suspicious.
We can't risk them finding this.
That little shit killed one of the two people who knew how to find the third seal.
Tucker, he was simply too... human.
As for his little gift...
Maybe...
Constance can still help us.
We can't hurt her anymore.
If we can't hurt her, we can't trust her.
We need to work fast, keep Wynonna and that gun away until we find the last seal.
And then...
Our love burns bright and true.
Holliday.
Wake up.
Reeves!
Wake up.
Did I fall asleep?
I did it.
I found him.
You found him?
Are you certain, Charlie?
He has been decloaked.
Alright.
I knew you could do it.
Fetch me my pistol.
Still, after all these years...
No matter.
This one's worth the wait.
Mark him with fire.

Doc Holliday will hang for his crimes.
'Cause I gave you all I've got to give
And no, that ain't no way to live
I told that devil
To take you back
I told that devil to take you back
So, these Widows, what are they?
Unclassified entities.
They broke out of BBD containment thanks to Doc's dynamite.
Not that I blame him for anything.
"Unclassified"?
Well, BBD is a big, bureaucratic place.
We hadn't gotten around to examining them yet.
They were sealed in that shipping container for over a century.
Together?
Hope they had mints.
That's why we didn't know about the paralyzing venom.
Yeah, which hurts like a mother.
No offense.
What we do know is that they've destroyed two seals and are tearing Purgatory apart to find the third.
Yes.

Hey, I've translated some of the text from one of the seal fragments.
It's ancient Phoenician.
"Let Thee Rise."
"Let Thee Rise"?
Dramatic.
Ominous.
My least favourite Boyz II Men album.
OK, so why didn't Tucker get breath bombed?
And how did they recruit him?
They needed him.
He's always been a royal dink, and evil sniffs out evil, like cancer.
And Mercedes and Beth?
They also have something to do with this.
The doctor is in.
Here's your patient.
The pregnant one?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Can I examine you somewhere private?
Dude, it's how I got into this mess in the first place.
Not often am I whisked away in a shroud of secrecy by two burly men.
If you're being held against your will, wave around your yogurt spoon.
Just... overprotective coworkers.
They don't want the bad guys to know I'm marshaling for two.
Well, the heartbeat is... strong.
How long since your last period?
Oof, can't say I miss the ole gal or had been tracking her visits.
Have you been pregnant before?
Heh heh!

Smoking?
- It makes my hair smell gross.

This... this whole thing took me by surprise.
I'm here to assess your health and the baby's, not to judge.
Sorry, judge is sort of a trigger word.
You're very nice.

Umm, what about genetic testing?
'Cause my family's history is pretty fakakte.
That should have been done months ago.
I'll need blood samples.

From you and, if possible, the father?
Regardless, this is the last time
I make a cloakanddagger trip to the middle of nowhere.
Next appointment is in my office with my equipment, where I can examine you properly.
Is it Bring your own speculum?
Hey.
So how is she?
Doctorpatient privilege ring a bell?
Take it outside, cowboy.
Now, who's driving me back?
- I will.

Listen, you and me surveillance, alright?

Mouth shut.

She's strong.
The baby will be too.
Hey, go outside.
Smoke, shoot things.
I do need to stay sharp.
I wonder how many generations have surveyed this land.
An Earp and a Holliday.
Damn.
Did you say "Holliday"?
Doc Holliday?
You lost, son?
Holy crow!
Are you really him?
Don't be foolish.
Fanboys...
Whatever the hell you are, you should not be on this land.
I'm starting to think you're not here for my autograph.
So, Doc's outside.
Yeah, I think it's, starting to settle in.
Him being a dad.
- Did he say that?

The more he feels;

Like a masseuse.
Waves... they need blood samples from both parents to do genetic testing.
He's gonna freak out.

No, he's not scared of anything.

I'm terrified.

Aaah!

Wynonna, what?
What's going on?
Just that Doc might not be the dad.
Then who is?
Don't shoot,
I'm just the messenger.
Despite my reputation,
I've never been one to gun down a child.
Who said anything about guns?
What the hell do you want?
A warrant was filed against you in Colorado in the year 1882.
- It was a long time ago.

- A witch threw me in a well!

Goddammit!
You've been marked with fire for capture and execution.
I suggest you get your affairs in order.

Let him come.
My God!

Yeah?

He'll be crushed.
Or relieved!
Hey, Doc "No strings attached" Holliday!
Are you serious?

He's nothing but strings.

How could this happen?
Would you like me to draw you a diagram?
'Cause I will.
Look, Doc and I, we didn't promise each other anything, so we can be grownups about this.
He's gonna shoot everything.
OK, you are kicking ass at not helping right now.
Just so you know.
OK.
Grownups or not,
I'll be here when you tell him.
OK?
Full support.
- Hi!

- Yeah, gotta go.

No, we should... we should talk.
I never thanked you for your note.
Itit really mattered.

May I ask... are you doing alright?
Of course you can ask.
Things have changed since my day regarding male participation in these matters... but I'll be as involved as you desire.
No more, no less.
All I want, and excuse me for being oldfashioned, is for you to be healthy... for you to be as close to happy as possible.
And I will do anything,
I will give anything to ensure it.
You're such an asshole.
Maybe I said it wrong.
The doctor wants us to do blood tests.
Of course.
Is there anything else?
I...

Well then, I'll leave you to it.
Doc.
Hey.
- Wait, Doc!

No...

Come on now, you cursed piece of junk!
Nicole, hey.

Keep flashing that smile and she'll fall in love with ya.
I told you not to make this weird.
I didn't say I wouldn't.
What are you watching for?
Evil.
Like a basic general evil?
Don't drop those on my floor.
Guess, no more Black Badge means the ban on coworker hookups is over.
You know, Wynonna is having Doc's baby, that's just like... crazy.
I mean, imagine the little rascal if he has.
Doc's piercing blue eyes and Wynonna's luscious hair.
I swear, seriously, we are going to be defenseless against such a glorious creature.
You think they're gonna get, like, a nanny?
Or a "manny"?
I'm not saying I'm gonna do it, but I wouldn't say no to some sort of light babysitting or daycare dates.
I don't know, one or the other.

- Shutting up, yeah.

Man...
Must be an easier way to find these Widows.
Lure them... bait them.
God!
My God!

No, no, no way.

This is a...
I found this on the floor of Shorty's basement after the Widows disappeared.
- Looks like one of their veils.

Probably still some venom on it.
That must have fell off when Wynonna shot them.
Alright, listen, we're gonna bag this up, OK?

Yeah, you're a genius!
You're like Rizzoli and Isles combined.
Shutting up.
Waverly left.
Cellphones, people, use 'em.
You'll have to take a rain check on the ol' popby.
Nicole, I'm leaving.

Look, who would I rather piss off?

Waverly sent you to babysit.
- Well, "mommysit" technically.

I am not to let you out of my sight until she comes back.
You're going through a lot, she doesn't want you to be alone right now.
Fine.

It's a little early to hit Shorty's.
Not Shorty's.

You coming or what?
- I guess I'm drinking for two.

I hate doing everything sober.
Holdin' hands
In the dark.
Whoa...
So much for being grownups about it.
I am too occupied to translate whatever cryptic thing you are telling me.
I just hope all this ammo isn't target practice on every guy in town who's ever looked at Wynonna with a tinkle in his... eye.
You cannot possibly understand what I am dealing with at this time.
Doc, you're still a part of this family, even if the baby isn't yours.
Poop.
She didn't tell you.
God, I...
Could be she'll be better off.
Hey, everybody, put your hands together
Jesse!
So this is Pussy Willows?
Wrong side of the wrong side of the tracks.
What kind of girls end up working in a place like this?
Well, maybe one with no family, a reputation for conjuring up fake demons and no other way to raise money for a bus ticket out of here?
Where you been, Aphrodite?
Hello. 'Sup, TJ?
I have my period, so you'll have to...
Who's Aphro...?
Pace yourself, there's... so much more to judge.
I came here a few months ago, when.
I got so drunk even Shorty's wouldn't serve me anymore,
- and I did something.

Him.
Well, drunk Wynonna still has standards.
Yeah, I...
No beer goggles here.
Wait, sorry, how many months ago?
Just... yea many.
Whoa, OK.

Mr. Onenightstand that you're now a crazy chick with a bun in the oven?
Officer Haught, so sweet, so naive.
Ahem!

You're gonna buy him a drink, and then you're gonna steal the glass for the saliva sample.
Science will tell us who the dad is, then we murder science to keep its filthy mouth shut, and hopefully I never have to tell Doc about this whole unsavoury scenario.
- That actually is a good plan.

Wynonna Earp by confronting problems head on.
Hey!

Hands off the girls!
His eyes, did you see his eyes?
Shit!
Not now.
Get him out of here.
Wynonna...
- you...

- Argh...

- Shit, shit!

After I killed the last of the seven, the... the Jack of Knives, it destroyed me.
So I dealt with it the best way I knew how:
I binged.
Lord, did I binge!
I just...

Most of the night was a blur.
Doc offered to bring me home, but I wasn't done so I came here.
It just...

I wanted to feel something good.
And he was nice.

And... you now what?

I never thought I'd see him again.
OK, so... you're the Earp heir, and he's a revenant, so that means the baby is...

It's Waverly.

I...
Hey, cutie!
Don't "cutie" me.
Hi, sweetiepie.

She's with me, and we're... fine.
I cannot lie to her.
You have to!
- I hear music.

Trashy.

You're at a strip joint!
Aphrodite made me do it!
Just shut your mouth.
Tell me which one.
- I'm so sorry.

OK, yeah, I guess I deserved that.
Hello?
You did not just hang up on me.
Next time, this... means don't tell my sister we're at a sleazy knocker locker.
It's Waverly, OK?

See?

I guess I deserved that too.
I did drag you into this shit storm.
And I...

Ready?
Yeah.
Wynonna?
Woman, how long has it been?
I'd say... about 28 weeks.
Hey,
Doc.
Are we in immediate danger or something?
We are not.

Doc, none of us could have known that those Widows spray a paralyzing vapour, OK?
Yeah, I suppose.
Also congratulations, man.
About Wynonna.

Listen.

I wanted to get along and just be mature about it.
Dolls!

I found traces of a powerful glycosylation toxin.

Doc, perfect!
I need two other sets of hands, and yours are so nimble and soft...
Not now, Jeremy.

Hey, hey, listen.

Step out of my way.
If I do, you sure as hell ain't taking our weapons.
Yeah.
I just need five minutes.
I'll give you three.
So if you ever find yourselves building a temporary shelter in a flood zone, do not forget to write your name on the inside of your mosquito helmet.
Amateur move, Haught.
I'll drink to that.
I pushed it to the limit.
Welcome to the stage,
- Vanessa!

Are we having a good time?
Yeah, we are, which is why we're gonna need a few more of those peppermint shots.
Because it's like drinking Christmas.
- You redheads are wild.

- I like you.

You too, Wynonna.
Even if you are here to kill me.
If I distill the toxin to its essential elements,
I can use them to develop a vaccine making us impervious to the Widows' vapour.
You may be a wiz with chemicals, but temporal measurement is not your strong suit.
- Five minutes?

OK, yeah.

Doll, you will remove the stopper, then I will add the accelerant.

We only have a split second to capture the toxin, so, we gotta be quick.
- You ready?

Is he praying?
In Icelandic?

Hold up.
My God!
He's accessing BBD archives.
Hey, stop!
What are you doing?
I'm casting a binding spell so it will lure the Widows to us and you guys can kill 'em.
- Ooh, boy!

What is that smell?
We didn't trap it;

A pungent magic show and a complete waste of my time!
Jeremy,
- what in damnation...

Congratulations.
Your binding spell worked.
You bound us all together!
I...
I'm a wizard.
So you knew who I was, and you had sex with me without telling me what you are.
I don't recall it being important to you that we tell each other our life stories before we bumped nasties.
We just came here for a drink.
Yeah.

Let me do the talking.
- OK.

Watch your mouth, or the little friend in my boot comes out to play.
Yeah, she means her gun.
And I got one too 'cause I'm a cop.
Nuts!

OK.
Let's not make a scene.
I got a lot of friends here.
If it comes to it, they'll surround you before you can even pop off two shots.
He's got a point.
What do you want, "anus"?
I mean, Jonas.
First, I wanna gloat.
And then I wanna ask you out on a second date.
We could do it out back.
If memory serves, it only takes ten minutes.
Oof, ten minutes?

Well, milady, you kind of don't have a choice.
Tell me you just got fat.
Don't touch her!
That's right, I keep one in my sock.
How smart am I?

- I'm smart.

We need an unbinding spell, Jeremy.
And we need it pronto!
Come on, you!
Whoawhoawhoa!
My quarrel's with Mr. Holliday;
You can go.

I can't.
Whatever they are paying you, I'll pay double.
Justice is my only compensation.
I do hate myself an honourable man.
As I hate myself a hypocrite.
- Get off me!

Go!

Nooo!
- I hate myself a phantom more.

You're the one who evaporated into thin air, Holliday.
But... justice delayed is still justice served.
Nothing from this earthly world can...
- Yeah!

I don't know.
Take my keys, you drive.
Yeah, no kidding.

Good aim too.

Sorry.
He knows.
Nicole, he knows that I'm harbouring a fugitive as in the next heir,
possible revEarp hybrid.

They're gonna come for it... and you!
Hey, wait!
Is that mine?
- No.

It's not supposed to be possible.
Do you know what we've done here?
We've started a new race.
We're the new Adam and Eve.
I see you more as the snake.
You wouldn't.
Come on, no fair!

Door prize.
- He's a bad guy, right?

You are drunk!

I hit three other strip clubs!
Three!

- Hey, you OK?

Him.
What do we do with him?
Take him for a ride.
So... tell me what you do to piss somebody off so bad that they're still after you.

So what did you do?
Poaching, threatening, stealing from a shipwreck...
Though the messenger did mention Colorado, 1882.
The right woman, the wrong night.

This is about a girl?
You're the most selfish guy I know.
You do whatever you want, whenever you want, and then when you get in trouble, you bring everybody down with you.
I thought we were gonna be mature about things.
I was leaving to face my demons on my own, which is how I work best.
Wynonna, that baby, they need you, so this whole lonewolf shit that you're doing, it ain't gonna cut it.
'Cause guess what, Doc?
You're gonna be a daddy.
Well, it is quite possible that I ain't.
I reckon that should put your mind at ease.
Huzzah!

- So like what?

What?

Gentlemen...
I do believe we have some unfinished business to attend.
Ghost.

Who you gonna call?

Sir.
- Recompense is acoming.

Jeremy, you're making this worse!
Nothing could make this worse!
Jeremy, stop!
It's a whole ghost cavalry.
Well, shit!

Don't even think about it.
That is a Colt Lightning.
Your personal effects will be given to your next of kin.
Wonderful.
You served under the great Wyatt Earp... yet a criminal.
A waste.
Let me out!
Hey!
God, I think I just had a hangover.
Haven't been this close to a revenant in a while.
I mean, you know, not that I know of.
- It's not always obvious.

OK, whatwhat if the baby's not his?
It doesn't matter;

We let him go;

So we hold him somewhere.
- Yeah.

It's what she does, Nicole.
It could be there's another way.
Don't know what it is though.
He might.
II got us stuck,
I ran like a coward;

Don't forget, I fornicated with the judge's wife twice.
God, you even screw up cooler than me.
What now?
Well, I guess a firing squad.
Yeah, and our only weapons are our words.
Look, you said yourself your quarrel is with me.
Let them go.
In harbouring a fugitive, they made themselves accomplices... and shall be punished as such.
You are victims of my mistakes, and for that, I am truly sorry, gentlemen, but I'm not going down without a fight.
So ready yourselves.
John Henry Holliday, you've received a sentence of death for seduction with intent to fornicate with the wife of the honourable Justice
Stanley Parker... twice.
Doc Holliday... is a classA pain in the ass... but he's also one of the most loyal and solid and fearless men I've ever met.
Yeah, he can be a polecat sometimes, but he's a changed man.
He's redeemed himself many times over.
And I'm proud to call this man my brother.
Son of a bitch!
It was... it was a great speech.
No, they branded me.
The five circles;
Each indicate a point on the fivesided star.
The U.S. Marshals' badge.
You are all unusually close.
Yeah, I know.
Reeves?
Yes?
Now, as I was saying...

- Do I know you?

You're the reason why I wanted to be a lawman!
Lovely.
Now,
- any last words?

Justice... integrity... and service.
- That's our motto.

- Going to my pocket.

I'm a supervisory deputy marshal, and I have several deputies under my command.
You outrank me.
Yeah, boys, he is who he says he is.
Sir!
Sir.
Doc Holliday is under my jurisdiction, gentlemen, and,
you are relieved of your duties in this particular case.
As you wish, Deputy Marshal.
As for Doc Holliday...
Thank you.
Doc Holliday, you... are pardoned.

Give them back their weapons.
- I'm tired.

I'm so tired.
- Whoo!

That was...

What?

So, mean any of those things you said?
Nah.
It was just to buy time.
You two.
What makes you think this kid could be yours?
A revenant breeding with a human?

That's the problem with rumours:
People tend to believe them.
This is history.
I'm gonna go down as the revenant that got the heir... preggers.
Not if we don't tell anyone.
I remember that night.
You stumbling in all doeeyed drunk, working those Westcoast hips to a little Lana... teasing out lap dances for free.
Stop it!
The place was crawling with revenants, and here you were performing for them all.
Of course, I was the only one that knew you were the heir.
I admit,
I was hoping you'd be a bit more of a challenge.
I always heard you had a mouth on you.
And you do.
Baby, one smile from me, and those legs
popped right open.
Shut your stupid, sexist pie hole!
I believe we were talking about her pie hole.
Enough.
We always thought the best way to defeat the heir was to kill her.
Lucky for us, she's a whore who defeated herself by letting one of us get inside of her.
Must be frustrating for you - ha - how much the world has changed.
- I'm your kid's father.

I'm gonna raise this kid to be good and strong,
and everything you're not.
You know, an Earp.
I'd say, "and don't you forget it," but you ain't got that kind of time.
Here's to single motherhood.
You're a superhero.
Same damn thing.
Wynonna...
This baby, what is it?
Ours.
- Is it gonna leave a mark?

You really had no plan out there?

They hadn't cocked their guns yet.

Old .45s can't pierce body armour.
Thought it'd absorb a few hits, then take 'em out while they reloaded.
Body armour, and you couldn't have shared?
Particularly as only you could touch them for some reason.
Yeah, we share a likeness.
We're both marshals.

I've oft brought calamity onto others, on that you are correct, but believe me,
I do not always get what I want!
Well, you are the father.
Because we need you to be a father.
Those marshals found you after all this time;
What do you think has changed?
I was at the bottom of a well for a long time, but now,
there is someone I need to visit.
How long until this bond wears off?
I think it already has.
And Jeremy, he's no wizard.
Shhh!
Here, man.
I suppose I could linger.
She's not going anywhere.
I have an ultrasound booked next week, but if my OBGYN is expecting samples, tough luck, she ain't getting any.

I already know the preexisting conditions on the one hand, revenantitis;
On the other,
Wyatt Earp's best friend.
Fakakte.
I'm sorry.
I kind of talked to Doc.
Waverly, what?
I...

I thought you told him.

Then I chickened out about telling you I chickened out, so...
Whoops.
Look, whoever the dad is, all that matters is that this baby...
There I said it, baby.
Still weird.
It's an Earp.
As Earp as you and me.
Hey, you're Auntie Waverly.
Yay!
You get to teach this thing its history.
Hey, what's going on?
Wave.
What about my history?
Waverly.
I don't think I'm your sister... or even an Earp at all.
What?
