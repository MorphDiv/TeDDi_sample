(ENGINE REVVING)
Are you okay?

Come on, come on, baby.
Come here, honey, come here.

Come here.

Is it your head?

It's okay.
All right.

- So...

He said someone's gonna meet us.
- All right, go with Mommy.

- What about you?

- Run, run, run!

- I'll be right behind you.

Faster.

Careful.
Watch the road.
Go to the left, honey.
Come on.

Go left.

GUARDIAN 1:

GUARDIAN 2:

Stay here, hon.

Come here, honey.

(WHISPERS) We're gonna hide right here.

Put your head down.

Now be very quiet, okay?

GUARDIAN 1:

- Mommy?

Quiet, baby girl.
Quiet.

Please don't take her!

(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO)
WOMAN:

A table, a lamp.
There's a window with white curtains, and the glass is shatterproof.
But it isn't running away they're afraid of.
(CHUCKLES) A Handmaid wouldn't get far.
It's those other escapes.
The ones you can open in yourself given a cutting edge.
Or a twisted sheet and a chandelier.
I try not to think about those escapes.
It's harder on ceremony days, but thinking can hurt your chances.
My name is Offred.
I had another name, but it's forbidden now.
So many things are forbidden now.
SERENA JOY:

You can sit.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
SERENA JOY:

So.
Old what's-his-name didn't work out?
- No, Ma'am.

This is your second posting then?
Yes, Ma'am.
Good.
Our last one was brand new.

I expect you know the rules.
Yes, Ma'am.
Don't call me Ma'am.
You're not a Martha.
Well, look what the cat dragged in.
This is the new one.
Hello.
Blessed be the fruit...
May the Lord open.
I'm Commander Waterford.
Peace be to you.
May God make me truly worthy.
Right.
Well.
Good.
Nice to meet you.
You too.
Get up.
I want to see as little of you as possible.
Do you understand?
Yes, ma...

Mrs. Waterford.
He is my husband until death do us part.
Don't get any ideas.
If I get trouble, believe me, I will give trouble back.
(SIGHS)
(BELL RINGS)
OFFRED:

It's the kind of thing they like the Marthas to do.
A return to traditional values.
That's what they fought for.
Always showing up when I'm in the midst of something.
Hold your horses.
SERENA JOY:

COMMANDER:

I'll be in my office.
Something wrong?
Just a conference call with my field commanders.
Then meetings.
Always a lot of meetings.
Right.

Of course.
I know it's hard, but keep faith.
We'll be rewarded.
I promise.
RITA:

Make sure they're fresh, not like last time.
Let them know who it's for and they won't mess around.
OFFRED:

Thank you.
You gonna stand there all day?
Be rude, leaving your friend outside waiting.
OFFRED:

That I've exchanged barely 50 words with her in the two months since I got here.
I kind of want to tell her that I sincerely believe that Ofglen is a pious little shit with a broomstick up her ass.
Under His eye.
Under His eye.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Sorry.
OFFRED:

Lives over the garage.
Low status.

Going shopping?
OFFRED:

You wanna come along?
Yes.
NICK:

I read they've got crazy levels of dioxin.
I'm going to Loaves and Fishes.
Oh, then you should definitely avoid the tuna.
Mercury?
No, I just don't like tuna very much.
OFFRED:

Maybe he watches me.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO)
OFFRED:

Peace be with you.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO)
OFGLEN:

May the Lord open.
Offred?
Are you okay?
Yes.
OFFRED:

Very well, thank you.
Thank you for asking.
OFFRED:

It's supposed to be for our protection.
For companionship.
(SCOFFS) That's bullshit.
There are no friends here.
Can't be.
The truth is we're watching each other.
She is my spy and I am hers.
We've been sent good weather.
Which I receive with joy.
The war is going well, I hear.
By His hand.
We've defeated more of the rebels.
They had a stronghold in the Blue Hills.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO)
We smoked them out.
Praised be.
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO)
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
Some artistic ones, please.
Oh, yeah.
- (GIRL LAUGHING) - (LAUGHS)
OFGLEN:

We should go.
(PIANO MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS)
Hey.
Under His eye.
Did you see?

Praised be.
The fighting in Florida must be going well.
Your Mistress likes oranges.
OFERIC:

Don't let a Martha take the credit.
I don't...

Tell them you're Commander Waterford's.
He's really high up.

I didn't read it.

We should get some oranges before they're all out.
(CHEERFUL MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS)
Praised be His bounty.
Take some.
OFFRED:

I need to scream.
I need to grab the nearest machine gun.
Should we walk home by the river?
That would be nice.
(FLIES BUZZING)
OFFRED:

I think I heard that joke once.
This wasn't the punch line.
AUNT LYDIA:

They filled the air with chemicals and radiation and poison!
So, God whipped up a special plague.
The plague of infertility.
Welcome!
Find a seat, please.
As birthrates fell, they made things worse.
Birth control pills, morning-after pills, murdering babies.
Just so they could have their orgies, their Tinder.
(POP MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)
Mmm.
Your turn.
(CHUCKLES) No, thanks.
What do you mean?
I have to write that paper tonight.
Oh.

- Yeah.

Campus sexual assault.
- For or against?

WOMAN:

- It's too cold, babe.

(WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)
Mmm.

What'd she say?
She just said, "Let's go to church."
(LAUGHS) Oh, did she?
- What's her name?

You don't know her name, do you?
- WOMAN:

(LAUGHS)
AUNT LYDIA:

Right there.
AUNT LYDIA:

They were sluts.
But you are special girls.
Fertility is a gift directly from God.
(SNICKERS)
AUNT LYDIA:

Like Bilhah served Rachel, you girls will serve the Leaders of the Faithful and their barren wives.
You will bear children for them.
Oh!
You are so lucky!
So privileged!
JANINE: (CHUCKLES) The fuck?
Welcome to the friggin' loony bin, right?
All right, girls.
We will have silence.
Like little mice.
JANINE:

(SIGHS)
Welcome to the Rachel and Leah Center.
Up.
Fuck you.
Blessed are the meek, dear.
(ELECTRIC CRACKING) (SCREAMS)
OFFRED:

(GROANS)
- JANINE:

JANINE:

(STRUGGLING)
AUNT LYDIA:

Where do your hands belong?
Girls.
Mmm.
I know this must feel very strange.
But "ordinary" is just what you're used to.
This may not seem ordinary to you right now, but after a time, it will.
This will become ordinary.
OFFRED:

With her, but she's...
She was so heavy.
- (SOBBING) I really tried.

I know.
You're gonna get her back, all right?
Just gotta keep your head down.
All this crazy shit is gonna end and then we'll find her.
I swear.
Do you pinky swear?
Yeah, I fucking pinky swear.
Okay.
What about Odette?
She was rounded up in one of the dyke purges.
She was reclassified as an Unwoman sent to The Colonies.
(DOOR CLANGS OPEN)
(JANINE CRYING)
You have... (CRYING) I don't wanna...

(MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY)
(CRYING CONTINUES)
(DOOR CLOSES)
OFFRED:

"If my right eye offends thee, pluck it out."
We're breeding stock.

(CRYING CONTINUES)
OFFRED:

And that gives me hope.
It may be false hope, but, hey, it's something.
OFGLEN:

I can't.
I have to get ready for the Ceremony.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO)
Praised be.
We'll go straight home, then.
May God bless your endeavor and bring forth His miracle.
Praised be.
OFFRED:

I am to make myself clean.
Washed and brushed like a prize pig.
She comes to me so clearly in the bath.
When do I come to her?
Does she remember me?
Please,
God.
Let her remember me.
(BELL RINGING REPEATEDLY)
(DOG BARKING)
(INHALES)
OFFRED:

(SIGHS)
The boys just kept coming down into the basement.
(CHUCKLES) For hours, it felt like.
I don't know, two, maybe three at a time.
I knew most of them.
From school.
(CHUCKLES) I just couldn't believe they were doing it,
that it was actually happening.
But it did happen.
Didn't it?
Yeah.
AUNT LYDIA:

(BANGS)
Whose fault was it?
(WHISPERS) I don't know.
Whose fault was it, girls?
ALL:

Her fault!

Her fault!

Her fault!

Go on, do it.
AUNT LYDIA:

ALL:

Teach her a lesson!

Teach her a lesson!

Those eggs you got today were nice and fresh.
RITA:

Some of us got things to do, you know?
Hurry up and wait.
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)
Late again, as usual.
What is it about men?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
OFFRED:

Come in.
It's a little thing, but, in this house, little things mean everything.
Good evening.
Dear.
Now, let's get started.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Excuse me.
"And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children,
Rachel envied her sister, and said unto Jacob,
Give me children or else I die.
And she said, 'Behold my maid,
Bilhah.
Go in unto her... (HEAVY BREATHING)
COMMANDER:

(COMMANDER GASPING)
COMMANDER:

and Jacob went unto her."
(GRUNTS)
(COMMANDER BREATHING HEAVILY)
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
Get out.
Are you deaf?
(SOFTLY) The...
The...

If I lay on my back afterwards.
Just get out.
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
OFFRED:

That's something.
They haven't changed that.
I'll think about the moon.
I can feel the Commander's come running out of me.
I can smell it.
(PANTING)
JANINE:

How are you?
Good morning.
How are you?
Hello.
Good morning.
How are you this morning?
Hello.
Hi.
Hello?
Good morning.
Janine?
JANINE:

Can I get you some coffee to start?
ALMA: (WHISPERS) Put your clothes on, dummy.
Aunt Beth is on bed check.
I don't want extra prayers on account of you.
Alma, go to bed, don't make this a thing.
OFFRED:

- JANINE:

- Hello now.

Snap out of it.
Janine!
- JANINE:

How are you today?
Come on.
MOIRA:

That's all gone.
Now, get back into bed.
What'd you hit me for?
Wasn't it good?

My name is Moira and this is the Red Center.
I don't know any Moira.
MOIRA:

They'll send you to The Colonies.
You'll be cleaning up toxic waste.
Your skin will peel off in sheets and then you'll die.
You will die, Janine.
JANINE:

I want my mom.
- I want my mom.

- I wanna go home.

Put this on.

OFFRED:

(CRYING)
Come on.
And shut up.
She does this again and I'm not around, you slap her.
- Hard.

Hey, that shit is contagious.
You want to see your baby girl again?
Then you need to keep your fucking shit together.
(EXHALES)
OFFRED:

He saw me outside last night.
But the Eyes haven't come for me.
There's no black van.
He hasn't told anyone.

Why not?
(CHURCH BELLS TOLL THRICE)
Three bells.
There's a Salvaging today.
Blessed day.

I heard.
So, now I've got my work to do and your shopping.
I'm sorry.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Good morning.
RITA:

Praised be.
Uh, the Commander wants you to get more oranges, if they still have any.
Yes, Sir.
- RITA:

Any other special requests?
They had tuna at Loaves and Fishes yesterday.
It looked good.
You should...

Oranges and tuna.
Sounds delicious.
- Under His eye.

(CHURCH BELLS TOLLING)
Go in Grace.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO)
Blessed be the fruit.
May the Lord open.
- Under His eye.

- Hey.

- Where are you posted?

He can barely get it up.
- Where are you?

Fancy pants.

Have you heard about anyone?
OFFRED:

She had a miscarriage.
That sucks.
- Have you heard from Moira?

Not since the Red Center.
Me neither.
Oh, she's dead.
- ALMA:

(WHISPERS) Janine?

Moira.

Yeah, she tried to run away.
They caught her, and they sent her to The Colonies.
So, she's dead.
She's dead by now.
AUNT LYDIA: (ON MICROPHONE) To your places.
Quick, quick.
Kneel.
Well.
Good morning, girls.
ALL:

AUNT LYDIA:

But duty is a hard taskmistress, and it is in the name of duty that we are here today.
This man has been convicted of rape.
(ALL GASP)
As you know, the penalty for rape is death.
This disgusting creature has given us no choice.
Am I correct, girls?
ALL:

Offred.
AUNT LYDIA:

Now, you know that I do my very best to protect you.
The world can be quite an ugly place.
But we cannot wish that ugliness away.
We cannot hide from that ugliness.
This man raped a Handmaid.
She was pregnant.
And the baby died.
(ALL GASP LOUDLY)
AUNT LYDIA:

Now, girls, up.
Wings.
You may come forward and form a circle.
You all know the rules for a particicution.
When I blow the whistle, what you do is up to you.
Until I blow it again.
(WHISTLE BLOWING)
(ALL SHOUTING)
(WHISTLE BLOWING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Offred, are you all right?
Have a nice day.
(CHURCH BELL TOLLING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO)
Hey.
(LINE RINGING)
- Sorry.

- You put our name in?

What?
We'll freeze our nuts off.

Hi.

Sorry, I'm just...

He staying over in Essex and there's, like,
- shitty cell phone reception there.

Um,
- so, I think I'm pregnant.

Oh, my God, are you...

Oh, my God!

Don't worry.
Don't worry.

And you did it.
That's not all they're saying, though, you know?
I know five women at work who've had miscarriages.
Some of them were pretty far along.
Yeah, well, that's not going to happen to you.
- You know Linda from Marketing?

She actually carried to term but her son only lived a few days.
That's not gonna happen.
But you don't know that, Moira, okay?
You don't know that.
- It could happen.

- If it does...

You've got a good man.
And you've got me.
No matter what happens, I'll be right here.
You and me, just like always.
I am so sorry about your friend.
Moira?
You knew her from the Red Center?
And before.
Was there ever a "before"?
OFGLEN:

They had the most amazing salted caramel.
It was better than sex.
Like, good sex.
I always thought you were such a true believer.
So were you.
So frickin' pious.
They do that really well.
Make us distrust each other.
Eyes.
Come on.

How old is your daughter?
Eight.
She'd be eight.
My wife and I had a son.
Oliver.
He's almost five.
They had Canadian passports.
I didn't.

We tried to cross in Maine.
With my husband.
Then we split up.
They shot him.
They weren't going to let any of us get away.
Not if you had a red tag.
This is your stop.
As they used to say.
It was nice to finally meet you.
You too.
There's an Eye in your house.
Be careful.
Blessed be the fruit.
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
(KITCHEN UTENSILS CLATTERING)
(LAUGHING IN DISTANCE)
SERENA JOY:

COMMANDER:

No rest for the weary.
We'll join you for dinner.
Go back to your room.
OFFRED:

Here, someone is always watching.
Nothing can change.
It all has to look the same.
Because I intend to survive for her.
Her name is Hannah.
My husband was Luke.
My name is June.
