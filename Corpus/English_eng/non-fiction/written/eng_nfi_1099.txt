My name is Clary and I'm a Shadowhunter, born to protect mankind from demons.
A never-ending battle against evil, but I know who I can count on.
Simon, my oldest friend.

Magnus, a warlock from Brooklyn.
Luke, a werewolf pack leader and New York City cop, and Jace, Izzy and Alec, three of the bravest Shadowhunters alive.
Alone, we're strong.
Together, we are unstoppable.
CLARY:

I knew there was something off about Sebastian.
JACE:

Your Highness, I'm here on business.
You don't want things to end well, do you?
I want change.

They'll hold the Institute at bay while I do what needs to be done.
I will kill them all.

- What's going on?

- What?

What would the Queen want with Maia?
She has this crazy obsession with me because of the whole Daylighter thing.
And then she invited me to live in her court, and I said thanks but no thanks, and then she... she threatened to hurt the people I care about.
She also offered shelter to every Downworlder.
That shelter comes with a price.
Loyalty to the Queen.

And she wouldn't desert her pack.
Maybe she found a lead on Valentine and is off hunting him down.
- Without telling me?

We're not making this up.

My warlocks are on the roof, holding up the wards to keep
Valentine in the city.

But the next time I see the Queen,
I will inquire.
(CELLO MUSIC)

Luke, if something happens to Maia because of me...
I'm not gonna let that happen.
QUEEN:

I'll pass on the lamb chops and get a ride back to Brooklyn.

That's not very polite.
Why am I even here?

If you don't feel like eating, you don't have to.
We can just chat.
Tell me about the Daylighter.
Simon?
We don't have to play pretend.
You know him well.
He's quite fond of you.

And how do you know that?
My eyes and ears are everywhere.
But there are certain things only a girlfriend would know.
The Downworld is on the brink of annihilation if Valentine gets to that lake.
As much as I would love to talk to you about Simon,
I really need to get back.
I assure you, dear, you are perfectly safe here.
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about my pack.

Patience.
Right... patience isn't really my thing.
AH!

Magnus's wards are up,
Valentine must still be in the city.
(SIGHING) Thank the Angel for Magnus and the warlocks.
They didn't raise the wards for us.
Teams are out doing block by block sweeps throughout the city.

Is that what happened?
You made a deal with Valentine?
He wanted to get past the wards.
So you gave him passage to Idris?
I wanted to protect my people, even those outside the safety of my realm.
We Seelies understand the power of negotiation.
Your idea of negotiation is putting the rest of the Downworld at risk.
Which is just fine by you, isn't it?
That way, you can rule it all by yourself.

We need to find the rift where they're coming from and seal it.

Magnus is not interested in helping the Shadowhunters.

Oh, and you want me to seal it.

Do you have any idea how many speeches
I've heard Malachi give?
How many times I've heard him... preach loyalty to Clave above all else under the Angel?
And all along he's... he's been working with our greatest enemy.
How does the Consul, the leader of the entire Clave, end up a Circle member?
Valentine threatened to wipe out any Shadowhunters who opposed him.
Malachi's just trying to save his own ass.
And sit back while everything around him is destroyed.
How could you side with him?
There is only one side.

Valentine is only doing what the Clave has been trying to accomplish for centuries:
eradicate demons.
No.

When Raziel created the first Shadowhunter, there was no such thing as Downworlders.
But over the centuries, disgusting half-breeds emerged.
Warlocks, vampires, Seelies, werewolves.
They banded together, grew more powerful.
Finally they will be destroyed.
And so will you.

IZZY:

Despite her requests, there have been no troop movements in and out of Alicante since.
When she went to Malachi to see what the holdup was, she was told he'd left suddenly.

(SIGHING) There is no other explanation.
ALEC:

We need to go help them.
I can't leave when the city is under assault.
What have you got?
We've identified the demons as a rare sub-species of Edomei.
- Edomei?

They're from Edom.

- So we've noticed.

Yet they haven't attacked once.

They work in hordes.
Perhaps they're increasing their numbers to reach a critical mass.
All the more reason to get this rift closed as soon as possible.
Their entry-point appears to be here, near Croton Point.

Jace and Clary are alone in enemy territory.
