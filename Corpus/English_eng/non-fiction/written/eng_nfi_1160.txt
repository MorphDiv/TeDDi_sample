Yes, we received your payment.
No, it wasn't late, but it was for 78.13, and the bill was for 78.31.
Okay.

No, thank you.

I think it's the intake manifold.
- Was I right?

I think I just like saying "intake manifold."
Maybe when I get a job, I'll get AAA.
I thought you worked at the water company?
Temping.
How's your parents?
They're doing okay.
I should, um, get going, actually, for dinner, but, um, we should make a plan.

Or we could do that now since we're both here.
- What?

Okay.
[Dad] Nice of Mercer.
I always thought you two would make a good...
- Mom.

Boy from the neighborhood?

[giggles]
Remember when he fixed the roof?
- Stop.

I know, I know.
[grunting]
Any word on the insurance?
Uh, they won't cover the cost of IGIV.

So, you know, surprise, surprise!

Oh, enough of all that.

- Help me up.

Here, you got it?
Thanks, Mae.
- Okay.

[Mom] That's it.
Well, not so fast.
[grunting]
Okay, and turn... just...
You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good now.

["'Tis a Gift" ringtone playing]
[Annie] What are you doing right now?
I'm at work.
I come here each day, and in return, I receive money to buy goods and services.
Oh, well, I've got to be quick, I'm in Germany.
Why are you in Germany?
Regulatory mess.

- But listen, I got you an interview!

I got you an interview tomorrow.
- [screams] - [laughs] Yes, I did.
- Really?

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I did.

Holy shit.

Remember, it's just Customer Experience, so answerphones, help people, what you're already doing, but now, a real company.
I know.

Tons of people started there.
I know, I know.

Stop saying that.

- One of them might as well be you.

This doesn't mean you're in.

Know The Circle inside out.

By then, you'll be hired if you kill the interview.
- Okay.

[interviewer] How would you describe what The Circle is to, say, your grandmother?
Take TrueYou, for example.
It combined everything that was separate and sloppy into one account.
No more forgetting your password, multiple identities, identity theft.
You use your real name, which is tied to your credit card...
I think grandma's falling asleep.
[sighs]
Okay.
Before TrueYou, it was like you needed a different vehicle for every single one of your errands.
And no one should have to own 87 different cars.

It's the chaos of the web made elegant and simple.
Speed round.

Early Paul, late John.
- Mario or Sonic?

Introspection or communication?
Uh...
- Mae?

So, that's introspection.

- Sushi.

- Yes.

- Yes.

Yes.
What was the name of the receptionist who checked you in this morning?
Um...
Linda.
Joan Baez or Joan Crawford?
- Joan Didion.

I'm not answering that, there's too much at stake.
Would you like to go out with me?
That's very inappropriate.
Good.

Not mutually exclusive.
Needs of the society or needs of the individual?
- Should be the same.

Unfulfilled potential.

We do that for visitors mostly.

Annie, that's the worst picture of me ever.
Oh, come on... oh.

- Danny!

So, you remember Dan?

I have the privilege and the honor to give you your brand new tablet, Mae, and I sent the password to your phone.
- Oh, my God.

Oh, this is too sad.

I will.
If we don't give customers a human and humane experience, we have no customers.

Jared will be doing your training.
I oversee the team, and Jared oversees the unit.
As you know, you'll be doing straight up customer maintenance for the smaller advertisers.
You work in your portable here.
It's gonna match the customer experience, and it gets routed over to one of you.
Random at first.

You get the query, figure out the answer, you write them back, and that is the core of it.
Simple enough in theory.

- Yeah.

So, let's say you've answered a client's question and they seem satisfied.
Now, it's not just that you get a Smile or a Frown, though that is part of it, you get your Smile...
It's almost always a Smile.
Um, that is when you send the survey.
The survey is a set of quick questions about, you know, your overall service, how you did, and they send that immediately back and you get to see how you did right here.
That is the rating.

Let's just do a live one.
- Excuse me.

...nice day.
[thumping on desk] [humming]
That's pretty good.
Ninety-nine is good, but I can't help wondering why it wasn't one hundred.
Let's look.
Okay...
Boom.

And we're back to a perfect score, yeah.
- Oh, wow.

All right.

- Yes.

[music playing throughout]
[Annie] Excuse me!

Hey, how's it going?
- I thought you were in Amsterdam.

Then London, then New York, now here.
- Have you slept?

A couple of pills, I'm good.

- Ugh.

You have an 87 average.

How long till I'm fired?
Listen, when I first started, it took me a few weeks to really get the hang of it, believe me.
Okay?

- Hello, I'm Eamon Bailey.

Thank you, thank you.

Now, a bunch of you are new to the company since I last spoke, so can the guppies all stand up?
- Right.

Guppies, stand up, come on.
Congratulations.

Now, now, guppies is just an affectionate term for you baby fishies.
Soon, you will all grow to become powerful...
- You're adorable.

The...

What, what do they grow up into?

All right, this is Dream Friday, the latest in our long tradition of presenting our newest innovations.
The first Dream Friday featured Ty Lafitte, the inventor of TrueYou and our founding father.
And usually, we feature one of our engineers or our visionaries, but today, unfortunately, it's just me, and for that, I apologize in advance.
- [man] We love you, Eamon!

[laughter]
Now, you might not have seen me around campus for the last few days, and maybe you're wondering just where the heck I've been.
- [woman] Surfing!

Argh, you got me.

And that's part of what I'm here to talk about.
I love to surf, and in the past, I would have to wake up and call the local surf shop to ask about the local breaks.
And pretty soon, the local surf shop stopped answering their phone.
[laughter]
And then I got a cell phone and I could call up my buddies who were already out at the beach before me.
And I could ask them, but they too stopped answering their phones.
And then came... the Internet.
[all] Whoa.
Some geniuses set up cameras on the beaches, so I could log on and get some very crude images of the waves at Stinson Beach.
It was almost worse than calling the surf shop.
Here's how it used to look.
[groans]
Almost useless, right?
But now, let's refresh that page and show the site with our new Circle video delivery.
- Now that looks pretty good, doesn't it?

Yeah, maybe I should be out there right now.
But would it surprise you to know that this is not coming from some big camera, but actually just one of these?
[oohing]
This camera needs no wires.
It transmits this image via satellite.
I set up that camera this morning.
I stuck it to a tree near the dunes with no permit, nothing.
In fact, no one even knows it's there.
And actually, I was pretty busy this morning because here's Rodeo Beach,
Montara, Ocean Beach,
Fort Point, this is my front yard.
[laughter]
And here's my backyard.

Oh, did you think this was just a camera?
No.

When you see this, you're also getting this.
[exclamations]
Air quality, traffic volume, weather patterns, biometrics, facial recognition, saved and searchable, all to serve you better.
My friends, we are looking at retailing these in just a few months for less than a pair of jeans.
And I'm not talking about fancy jeans.
I'm talking about the ones like I'm wearing.
Now, Circlers, do you like to share?
Sharing is caring!
Sharing is caring.

- Sharing is caring?

Well, I have a dozen helpers all over the world right now carrying these cameras.
Imagine the human rights implications.
Activists no longer have to hold up a camera.
Now it's as easy as gluing a camera to a wall, and actually, we've done just that.
Do you see any cameras here?

We have 144 cameras in place here, and it took us just a day to do it and they're virtually invisible.
They come in every color, so camouflaging is a cinch.
This is my favorite.

Nice catch.

So now, the entire world is watching.
You know, I agree with The Hague, with the human rights activists all over the world.
There needs to be accountability.
Tyrants and terrorists can no longer hide.
We will see them.

We will hear and see everything.

We're calling it SeeChange.
- SeeChange.

Oh, and we'll go to good things, too.
- [audience] Aw!

We will see it all because knowing is good... but knowing everything is better.
[cheering and whooping]
- [laughter] - [music playing]
Good thing you guys like to keep things modest.
What's this party even for?
SeeChange, summer solstice, everything, nothing.
Come on.

Oh, my God, is that Beck?
[Annie laughs] [vocalizing]
[singing "Dreams"]
So Bailey... what's he actually like?

Yeah, but I don't get a ton of alone time with him.
I mean, you know, a lot of people work in the White House, but how many people really get to know the president?
Oh, actually, do you wanna see something?
Oh, my God, you need to see this.

Okay.

[giggling]
Nice knocker.
[chuckles, murmurs]
Holy shit, right?
Right?
I think all of these have got to be first editions.
Oh, but, um, you have to give me a verbal nondisclosure agreement, okay?
- Annie...

We shouldn't be here and probably won't ever be here again, so verbal NDA.
I promise not to disclose anything.
Good.

It's very serious.
I mean, this is high nerd, right?
Oh, no, you probably shouldn't play with...
With this?
[laughs]
You're such a dork!
Wow.
So, this is where it all happens.
To be a fly on the wall, right?
We should get back to the party.
- [phone buzzes]

- You're not coming back?

Annie, it's like 11:00.
I've got Australia in a few minutes.

Ah-ha, actually, a few minutes ago, but you have fun, okay?
- Annie!

[party chatter, laughter]
[surprised grunt]
So, I heard there's a party around here.
You know, if that's, like, your kind of thing.
Yeah, maybe I'll check it out.
It's probably not as interesting as whatever's on your phone, though.
Okay, probably not.
You want a drink?
I do, but they ran out, like, an hour ago.
I think they did, too, but shh...
Are you serious?

You have glasses in there, too?
It's my, uh, party trick.
Oh.
All right.
Thank you.
You're new here.

How can you tell that?
I don't know, I just guessed.
That's really embarrassing.
Sorry. [laughs] What do you think?
- Of this?

I'm excited.
Mm-hmm. [represses laughter]
- Sorry...

It's just that everyone that works at The Circle is so excited to be here, and they just want to tell everyone about it all the time,
- you know, it's just...

- Delicious!

I love Kool-Aid.

After my last job, where I just tried to calm down angry people all day... [phone buzzing]
I'm just grateful to be here.
I gotta go put out a fire.
Sounds exciting.
- Very.

Have a drink, have a good time, and stay excited.
You're at The Circle!

So, it's been great?
I don't think I ever want to work anywhere else.
I told, um, Carolina's mom...

- Oh, Mom.

It's been fun to casually insert it into conversation.
"My daughter works for the best company on the planet... and has full dental!"
Please don't.

- If it wasn't for Annie...

She's good.

What does she do, exactly?
She's in the Gang of 40.
Uh-huh.
She's in on all the big decisions... deals with the regulatory issues in other countries.
That sounds so important!
Mae, hon, would you get your daddy another beer?
Sure, Dad.
[chuckles] Your hair.
- It was a phase.

You good?
I'm good.
You should come visit me at work sometime.
At The Circle?
I'll give that idea a Smile, right?

They might think I was there to clean the toilets.
Come on.

All those tech guys secretly wish they knew how to use a handsaw, make something out of wood.
That really sums me up pretty well.
It could be worse, I guess.
You know what I mean.
They'd want you to tell them about your secret hiking spots.
Oh, so they can put them on TrueYou, ruin it forever?
Ooh, biting commentary.
I mean, come on, you have to admit, like, Smiles and Frowns used to be for middle school.
Like, "Hey, you know, do you like stickers and unicorns?"
"Yes, I love stickers and unicorns.

Now it's everyone.
I can't help it if you're not... social.
I am social enough.

I assume you've heard about that senator that's trying to, like, break you guys up, citing antitrust laws, right?
Give me a break, Mercer.
Don't you have to go and chop some wood or something?

- Thanks, hon.

His business is doing well.
Mercer?

They are beautiful, Mae.

Did I tell you I'm up to an 87 so far?
They say that's pretty good for a guppy.

Hmm?

[senator] Today, I call upon the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee to investigate The Circle.
We cannot rely on them to say, "We're not violating antitrust laws."
I'm sure The Circle will be glad to cooperate.
We have every confidence that Senator Williamson's allegations will be discredited.
You were probably wondering about your new screen.
Hi, I'm Gina.

Dan said this would be a good moment to set up all your socials.
- Do you have time?

- Great.

Sorry, I've just been kind of overwhelmed so far.
- Oh.

I just haven't had time yet for extracurricular stuff.
Wow.
That's so interesting you put it that way.
We actually see your profile and the activity on it as integral to your participation here.
This is how your coworkers, even the ones on the other side of campus, know who you are.
Communication certainly isn't extracurricular, right?
Right!

We consider you a full, knowable person of unlimited potential, and a crucial member of the community.
But you're such an enigma.
I am?
It's been years since someone so shrouded in mystery started here.
Everyone really likes you.
Your work's been exemplary, strong ratings for your first week.
Are you satisfied with your performance?
Uh, I-I think I can do better.
Good, but it's not all about work, okay?
It's also about community.
- Of course.

But you've had a blip or two when it comes to meshing with the community, like your absence at several weekend or evening events, which are, of course, optional.
- I'm sorry?

You left campus at 11:42 p.m. on Friday, and got back 8:46 a.m. Monday.
Was there work on the weekend?

- Oh, no, no, no, no.

There wasn't mandatory work on the weekend.
This isn't like a clock in, clock out type place, thank God!
But, you know, there were thousands of people here, participating in a hundred different activities.
So many!
I'm sorry, I...
My dad had an... an episode, and I was home helping out with that.
I'm so sorry to hear that.

Uh... yeah.
We didn't know anything about this incident.
Did you reach out to any Circlers during this crisis?
Annie, anybody?
Uh, no, I...

Mae, there are four groups here for staffers dealing with MS, two of them for children of MS patients.

I didn't know...
Okay.

Nothing, really.

You kayaked?

Nobody.

I kayak.

Nothing on your profile about kayaking, no Smiles, no ratings, no posts?
I'm no psychologist, but this behavior sometimes stems from low self-worth.
This is what participation is all about, bringing you, lifting you up...
Thus, your participation window.
I can't believe you've been here this long without being on the main social feed.
You're about to have your world rocked!
See, these are all of last week's messages.
That's why there's so many.
- 8,000?

Looks like you have a lot of catching up to do here.

Have fun!
Oh, forgot.

This is your participation rank, parti-rank for short.
Some people here call it the popularity rank, but it's not really that.
It's just an algorithm-generated number that takes into account all your activity in the Inner Circle.

Then you and the media band will get used to each other, but it has to touch the skin to work.
Waterproof, no need to take it off.
Let's activate it, shall we?
Is that the...?
Well, it's syncing up with the sensor you ingested a second ago.
- And now...

Let's have you walk around the room.
[sensors beeping]
Briskly.
It'll collect data on your heart rate, blood pressure, cholesterol, sleep duration, sleep quality, digestive efficiency, on and on, and all that data is stored in the cloud and in your tablet, anywhere you want,
and, of course, it's all collated with the rest of The Circle.
You'd be amazed at the patterns we see and the problems we can avoid when we have all that data.
Speaking of which, I was thinking it would make sense for Mae's folks to come on The Circle Health Plan.
Uh, wait, what?
It wouldn't be the first time, and I'd really like to get real-time data from your dad.
Sit back down.
Can you get in touch with HR, clear it with them,

We'll send someone out to set them up, okay?

Thank Annie, too!

This is so great!

Okay, I gotta go.

- Exciting.

- Love you!

- Bye, Mom!

[crying] Thank you.
Aww...

All right.

Okay, come on.
[cheers and applause]
Openness is something we advocate here at The Circle.
We live it.
We demonstrate our commitment to openness every day.
Our government, not so much.
We expect openness, and we get obfuscation.
We get doublespeak.
I mean, no wonder Congress's approval rating is currently at 11 %.
Now, I'm sure a lot of you have heard about a certain senator who, it was revealed, has been involved in some... very unsavory business.
What are we to learn from this?
We need accountability.
We need openness.
We need to know what the people who represent us are doing with their time on our dime... [applause] ...to serve us better.

What is this?
Oh, it's supposed to be a part of the subway, but they abandoned it.

Gets too wet.
And that's where the rest of it will be.
- Rest of what?

Santos is just the start.
The plan is everything recorded, seen, broadcast, all of it stored, analyzed, available to The Circle in any way.
You did your health intake, right?
- Yeah.

Every step, every breath, all of it, stored.
They can use it however they see fit.
We're being studied.
Everyone's data in The Circle is being studied, monetized.
It is voluntary.
And isn't that the whole point, having everything in one place?
I mean, that's TrueYou.
That's not why I invented TrueYou, not even close.
Ty Laffite invented TrueYou.
Yeah.

No, you're not.
Ty Laffite's been off the grid for years.
Oh, my God.

I'm Ty.
Why the low profile?
I just wanted to move through this world like a normal person.
I didn't want to be watched every second.
I do spend a lot of time here.
It's easier.

Holy shit!
I'm in a cave with Ty Laffite.
Now, hold on.
So, when we met, you didn't know who I was?
You never told me your name, and after a while, it was just weird to ask.
I knew I could trust you when I met you.
I don't know, I just thought to myself,
"This girl, she doesn't have a cynical bone in her body."
Reminds me of how I used to be.
Listen, you can't tell anyone that you were here, okay?
- That I brought you here.

Things at The Circle...

Like what, connecting the world?

You should be really proud of what you created.
No, proud?

The disregard for privacy?
The use of personal data for the accumulation of wealth and control?
I'm not proud.

[shivering] I can't believe I was so stupid.
I'm so lucky you guys were around here.
Luck?

The cop saw you go through the fence, and then we got a call from someone watching seals.
So, Mae, how do you feel?
Ashamed.

Well, I'm just glad you're safe.

And everyone who watched your adventure online.
- I hope your folks weren't too worried.

I understand your father's condition has improved.
Very much.
Mr. Bailey...
I want to say how much I value my position here... and what you've done for my family.
Mae, you're a valued part of The Circle, and of your family.
And we care about everybody you care about.
You know, this incident has actually shown a lot of people the necessity for SeeChange.
I'm so glad those cameras were there.
Well, I wish you would've known there was a camera there before you swiped that kayak, but...
Mae, Tom and I want to talk to you about an idea, but before we do...
Is there anything you want to tell us?
That I've been here before?
It's only our lies that get us in trouble, the things we hide.
Of course, I know you've been in here before.
[both laughing]
And now that I know your secret, do you feel better or worse?
Better.
Relieved, actually.
I am a believer in the perfectibility of human beings.
When we are our best selves, the possibilities are endless.
There isn't a problem that we cannot solve.
We can cure any disease, and we can end hunger, and...
Without secrets, without the hoarding of knowledge and information, we can finally realize our potential.
[applause and cheering]
[Eamon] This is a special Dream Friday.
I thought I'd change it up a bit today and not have a speech, but an interview.
I had a conversation with a young Circler the other day that I wanted to share with you.
I've asked Mae Holland, who some of you might know is one of our new guppies in Customer Experience, to join me today.
Mae's only been with us for a few months, but she has made quite an impression.
Let's bring her out.

[applause]
Well, hi, Mae, how are you?
- Terrified.

- Don't be nervous.

[chuckles] Right.
All right.

I committed a crime.
I borrowed a kayak without the owner's knowledge, paddled out to the middle of the bay... and I wasn't wearing a life jacket.
Well, I'm not sure that's exactly a capital offense, but you did risk your own life.
So, Mae, do you think you behave better or worse when you are being watched?
Better.

What happens when you're alone and unobserved?
- Well, for starters, I steal kayaks.

Jesus.

Seriously, I... do things I don't wanna do.
I lie.
When we spoke the other day, you had a way of putting it that I thought was very interesting and succinct.
Could you tell us all what you said?
I said that secrets are lies.
Secrets are lies.
Go on.
Secrets are what make crimes possible.
We behave worse when we're not accountable.
I was my worst self because I didn't think anyone was watching.
I thought... that I was alone.
So, what did you see on this kayaking trip, Mae?
Was it beautiful?
It was.
There was almost a full moon, and it felt like... felt like I was paddling through liquid silver.
Mm.

But there's no record of any of it.
- Not outside my own memory.

Okay.

As you know, I have a son, Gunnar, who was born with cerebral palsy.
And though he's living a very full life and we're always trying to improve his opportunities, he is confined to a wheelchair.
And he-he can't walk, he can't run, he can't go kayaking.
So what does he do if he wants to experience something like that?
Well, he watches video.

And much of his experiences of the world come through the experience of others.
When he experiences the view of a Circler climbing Mount Kenya, he feels like he's climbed Mount Kenya.
When he sees first-hand video from an America's Cup crew member, he feels, in some way, that he's sailed in the America's Cup too.
And these experiences were facilitated by generous humans who shared what they saw with the world, my son included, and there are many others out there that are just like Gunnar.
Now, does it feel right to have deprived them of seeing what you saw, Mae?
It doesn't.
It feels very wrong.
It was selfish.
When you deprive others of experiences like the ones I had... you're essentially stealing from them.
Knowledge is a basic human right.
Access to all possible human experience is a basic human right.
[cheering]
[man] Tell 'em, Mae!
Thank you, Mae, for your candor and your consummate humanity.
Now... now the best part.
In the interest of sharing everything she can with the world,
Mae has...

From now on...
I'll be wearing a modified SeeChange camera... at all times.
I'm going fully transparent.
[applause]
Well, maybe not in the bathroom.
[laughter]
I'm gonna be starting immediately.
[Eamon] That's right!
Mae will be the first Circler to share every single second of her work and her personal life with the public, so let's give her an even bigger hand!

Okay.

I finally get to use my art history degree.
This was made by an artist who's frequently been in trouble in his own country.
I want to thank all the watchers who sent Frowns to the government there, both for their persecution of the artist, and for their restriction on Internet freedoms.
We have sent 180 million Frowns from the US alone.
You can bet that's gonna have an effect on the regime.

Oh, come on, false modesty won't work here.

Yeah.

You're a meteor.

People are coming to me trying to get to you.

How are you really, Annie?

Thanks, Mae.
You know how much I like to be told right after I appear in front of your millions that I look terrible.

Let me take you for dinner.
You gotta eat sometime.
With your camera and me looking so terrible, that sounds fantastic, but no.
I just...

- You're working too hard.

You're...

- I didn't mean it in that way.

I know you can handle it.
Oh, thank you, Mae!
Your confidence in me will be the wind beneath my wings.
How are your parents?
Sorry.
They're over that little... episode?
I haven't heard from them, actually.

Guess it'll just take some time.
Sorry, Mae.

I'm fried... and I have to pull another all-nighter.
Stenton is on my ass all the time.
I shouldn't have questioned him about that whole Senator Williamson thing.
And then... there's all the new work on Completion... but I assume Bailey told you about that.
- Of course.

I'll be there at the Concept Kingdom meeting tomorrow.
- What?

There's a Concept Kingdom meeting...
I know what it is, but you're going?
Yeah.

And broadcast it?
Is that a problem?
No, I'm just surprised, that's all.

You know, maybe he's planning on having you attend just the beginning.
[dry chuckle] Mae, you're in over your head.
Are you leaving?
Yeah. [clears throat]
I'm really so far behind on everything, I could just die.
Annie?
[electronic voice] Hello.
See you.
So, here's how many people voted in the last national election.
Here's how many were eligible to vote.
And here's how many Americans are registered in The Circle.
And there's that guy.
So, now we get down to the meat of today's session, something we've discussed with Congresswoman Santos and others...
What if your Circle profile automatically registered you to vote?
With TrueYou, in order to set up the profile, you have to be a real person with a real address, the complete personal info, real Social Security number, with all the information that the government wants
when you register to vote.
So, why wouldn't the state consider you already registered when you open a Circle account?
There's no reason!
We've got verbal commitments from governors of almost every state, and they've agreed to push for legislation that would make your Circle account an automatic path to voter registration.
I think it's a great idea.
Well, yes, Mae?
Why couldn't we take it one step further?
I mean, I...
I don't have it completely figured out yet...
No, no, no, no.

You started really well there.
I like those words, "one step further." It's how the company was built.
Okay.

Go on.
...we all agree 100% participation is what we like.
100% participation is the ideal.
That's the idealist's ideal, yes.
And we already have 83% of voting-age Americans registered to The Circle.
Yep.
And it seems we're on our way to users being able to register, and maybe actually vote through their Circle account...
Well, that's a small leap, but yes.

Why not require every voting-age citizen to have a Circle account?
[laughter]
Let her finish.

Okay, I know the initial reaction will be resistance.
I mean, how can we require anyone to use our services?
But there are all kinds of things that are mandatory for citizens of this country.
We have to pay taxes we don't want to pay, and we have to pay for Social Security.
We have to serve on juries.
Right, and we have to pee indoors, not on the street.
We do, we do have to pee indoors.
- She's right.

We require citizens to do hundreds of things, but we don't require them to vote?
They're already doing this in dozens of countries.
With the technology we already have, users will already be registered.
That means you have 241 million voters eligible to vote.
You have 241 million voters that have to vote.
You have the full will of the nation.
And how exactly do we do that?
Annie.
Well, you know, it could be something as simple as a Zing.
"Hey, Annie, remember to take five minutes and vote."
That's what we would do with our own surveys.
You know that.
But, Mae, what about stragglers?
We all pay taxes... and, what, 80% of us did that online last year?
Why not stop duplicating services?
Why not just make it all part of one unified system?
You could pay your taxes, vote, pay your parking ticket, all through your Circle account.
We'd save users hundreds of hours of inconvenience.
We'd save the government billions.
Hundreds of billions.
We could eliminate half of it overnight.
Why wouldn't the government just build a similar service?
Why the hell do they need us?
It would cost too much.
They don't have the expertise.

[Eamon] You are absolutely right.
The government needs us more than we need them.
Imagine having the full will of the people... instantly.
You'd have true democracy for the first time in human history.
- [Annie] This is such bullshit.

No voter suppression.

Think of the implications for totalitarian regimes.
No more rigged elections.
The UN can demand that they're held through The Circle.
But only if everyone is heard.
Absolutely.
Every human on Earth.
We can take the pulse of the nation.
Everyone in the world in seconds on any subject.
It's the only way, right?
- Right!

So, it looks like I've got 20 minutes here.
Let's try Mom and Dad.
[dialing]
It's totally cool, man, Saturday night.

Already, 22 nations have agreed in principle to operate their elections through The Circle, with mandatory participation from all of its citizens.
[cheering]
When everyone is united, everyone is known, heard, accountable, they can be better served.
But what about the people who aren't part of The Circle, who don't want to be woven into the fabric of society, or worse, want to tear at that fabric?
I want to introduce SoulSearch, and we're putting it to the test in front of the entire Circle audience, here and globally.
Do you feel ready?
Hell, yeah!
[Tom] Lined it up so far.

In seconds, the computer will select at random a fugitive from justice, a proven menace to our global community.
Our assertion is that whoever he or she is,
SoulSearch will locate them in under 20 minutes.

Let's select that fugitive.
Okay.

She was convicted of triple murder in 2004.
She locked her three children in the closet and went on holiday to Spain.
[booing]
They all starved.
She was sent to prison in England, but escaped with the help of a guard who she apparently seduced.
Over a billion people are watching.
