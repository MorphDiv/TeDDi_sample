Previously on "Bates Motel"...
We pulled two bodies out of falls lake a couple days ago.
We just identified one of them.
I thought you'd want to be the one to tell your wife.
The Bates Motel is a family business, and I feel like I've been part of the family.
N-Norma, you've always been so close to me.
He killed his mother.
He loved her.
If you know what Norman's done, you're an accessory to murder.
Says the escaped convict.

[Dramatic music]

[Grunting]
Norman Bates, you're under arrest for the murder of Sam Loomis.
Norman, I'm gonna get you a lawyer.
Don't say anything until your lawyer gets there.
Norman is not a bad person, and he's not a criminal.
What do I need to know about him?
He has another side to him.
I don't know what you'd call it.
Maybe multiple personalities.
[Grunts]
I'm the only one who's gonna protect you.
[Slamming]
It's time for me to fix this.
[Camera shutter clicks]
Turn to your left, please.
[Office phones ringing distantly]
[Shutter clicks]
Okay, if you could step up to the desk, please.
I need to take your prints.
Wha... what do I do here?
Place your right thumb down on the scanner.
Hold it there until you hear a beep, and don't move.
There's no ink?
Ink smudges.

Wait for the beep.
[Beep]
Place your right index finger on the scanner, please.
[Beep]
Left thumb, please.
So what happens next?
- Wait for the beep.

[Beep]
Tomorrow you'll go before the judge.
After that, it's anybody's guess.
Mine is you'll be moved within 48 hours to a pre-trial detention facility.
Left index finger, please.
Detention facility?

You'll be warehoused wherever the judge wants to keep you.
But it won't be here.

That's a bit premature.
Whatever happened to bail?
That's up to the judge.
Personally,
I wouldn't count on it.

What a relief.
Are they treating you all right?
If I said they weren't, could you get me out?
I'm sorry, Norman, this is gonna be a tough road.
So what happens now?
Well, tomorrow you have your preliminary hearing.
The judge has to decide whether to take the case to trial, depending on the state's evidence.
It's a formality, but from what I've seen, they're taking you to trial.
Which is why we need to start thinking about our approach.
Oh, well, I didn't do it, so not guilty.
I agree.
You believe me?
I agree with your approach.
There are no light sentences when it comes to serial homicide.
But if you plead guilty, the best we can hope for is to keep you alive.
Multiple life sentences in a maximum security prison.
With your permission,
I would like to aim a little bit higher.
Permission granted.

Not guilty by reason of insanity.
So I spend the rest of my life in an institution?
Probably, yes.
I don't like it.
I don't blame you.
But I...

I asked multiple times for my medication.
They never gave it to me.

She hated me the moment she met me.
It's like I smelled bad to her or something.
It's weird.

It's inappropriate.
Yeah, she messed up.
She crossed the line.
And I will make a motion in court to suppress your confession on the grounds that it was made during duress and cognitive impairment.
That's great.

But the state still has very strong physical evidence against you, Norman.
Look, we can take our chances fighting it piece by piece, but you have a legitimately strong insanity plea.
Because my stepfather locked me up in an institution?
Sure.
Also, because maybe you needed to be there.
Look, uh, your brother says you struggle with multiple personalities.
