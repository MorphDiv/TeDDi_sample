Previously on Genius...
This Rontgen fellow, snatched the credit you justly deserve.
He's a rat, like the Jews.
Rats, must be eradicated.
It's only the very first Nobel, you will win the next one.
In this class we will deal only with what has been proven.
The existence of molecules has not.
Such a charming dinner companion.
You won't even know I'm gone.
She deserves more attention than I have to give.
Mother, you know very well that I have someone else now.
Milena, you're the love of my life.
I'm better than a clerkship.

This is an original piezoelectric meter, yes?
But it would be far more precise with the addition of a mirrored quadrant electrometer and an ionization chamber.
I considered an ionization chamber but wasn't convinced that air would be a sufficient dielectric.
I'm studying at the Sorbonne.
Pierre Curie.

It sends an electromagnetic signal at the speed of light.
A wondrous notion!
As a patent clerk, however, I must ask myself if this device can actually deliver on it's promise.
According to Newton, the answer is yes.
Absolute simultaneity is possible because, well, time is absolute.
And this all works if we're sending a signal from Bern to Zurich, say.
But what happens if we're sending a signal from Bern to a clock on a moving train?
It's much too large...
If I can make it work properly
Your job is not to make it better.
How are you progressing with the signal box and rail switch applications?
Have them on my desk by the end of the day.
Please, I have a very important meeting...
If I were you, I wouldn't be so cavalier about the position that pays to support them.
I was detained at work
Our time was up an hour ago.
Just give me five minutes.
I promise my thesis proposal is unlike anything you've ever heard.
Well, everyone believes that light is a wave, yes?
Well, I can prove that when a light ray is propagated from any point, it consists of a finite number of energy quanta which can be produced and absorbed only as complete units.
That only took ten seconds.
[Laughs].
Do you remember Philipp Lenard's paper on the photoelectric effect?
He demonstrated that light doesn't always act like a wave.
But he couldn't explain it.
Well guess who can?
No, well, yes, yes, but, no...
Max Planck!
I believe I can use Planck's constant to demonstrate the photoelectric effect and prove the duality of light.
He didn't even read my proof.
But no one will ever know it if the bloated windbags of academia won't even consider my proposal.
A piece of paper you can frame and hang on the wall?
To be acknowledged and discussed.
To be recognized.
You must get your work noticed by more important scientists.
Publish your paper.
Giving up is a luxury I could never afford.
You can either wait for those dinosaurs to give you permission to engage in the scientific world, or you can show them.
That your ideas can not be snuffed out by those who lack imagination.
I'll help you.

Have you read this?
Some fellow in Bern has used your discovery of light quanta to prove Professor Lenard's findings on the photoelectric effect.
Quanta are a mathematical construct.
They're not a real phenomenon.
"On a heuristic point of view concerning the production and transformation of light."
It's a bit lofty, don't you think?
Four weeks and not a peep!
It was one paper.
I'll simply write another.
And if no one takes any notice, I'll write another.
They can't ignore me forever.
We only need to find a problem.
Shouldn't be too difficult.
Not with you helping me.

Try it again.
It's not an anomaly.
This sample must contain a new element.
A radioactive element.
We must isolate it.
Pierre.
Working tirelessly, side by side, without heat in their lab or funding for their research.
It's romantic, no?
I have only three hours until the patent office opens.
You can't think properly without sleep.
I need more coffee.
Those weeks we spent holed up in my room?
Not all of it to do with science.
What if, instead of studying gases, we studied a cup of coffee?
Particles in a solution behave like a gas.
When sugar dissolves in coffee, water surrounds glucose and tears it from the sugar crystal, correct?
The more sugar I add, the thicker the coffee becomes.
If we can calculate the osmotic pressure, perhaps we can deduce the precise number of
It's brilliant...
Nickel-zinc battery.
I'm well ahead of schedule.
If I could be granted the smallest parcel of time...
It's unbearable!
He gives me four times the work as the other dolts in the office because I'm the only one who understands mechanical engineering!
A boss who respects your intellect and a full time job that pays twice as much as mine?
I've been toiling in obscurity for ten hours a day, six days a week for the past two years and I never see my family, I never see my baby.
Now what do you want?
Whatever they say, whatever they write, people pay attention.
I want to wake up in the morning to pursue my passions instead of being confronted with a constant sense of dread that I, that I'm wasting my life.
I need help.
Someone to work alongside me, to ease my load until I can make a mark with my ideas.
[Laughing].
It's a good job.
Second class patent clerk in the mechanical engineering division.
In fact, he was instrumental in helping me secure the position.
You never know what might be crawling around in them.
Roaches, mice, Lucifer himself.
His agents are among us.
I hear them.
Open your ears!
Do you remember when you dug a trench in the snow, covered it with a canvas and declared it your winter palace?
But mama wouldn't have it.
So strong.
You seem happy again.
I don't need a degree for that.
I can't abandon everything to look after Hans all day.
He only stops crying when mother holds him, and...
I'll make sure you have whatever you need...
I married you because I love you.
You are not a prized heifer to be bought and sold
Ow!
[Baby crying]
Pick up the baby, Albert!
How are we to manage?
I will ask my mother to come.
She knows how to run a household, how to care for a child, she will make it possible for you and
I to continue our work.
And how could she despise the woman who gave birth to her only grandson, huh?
He's the spit and image of his grandfather.
We clean up after our husbands more than our children.
That one is terribly wrinkled.
Don't you have a pressed one?
Good day to you Frau Einstein.
And to you Frau Einstein!
We do appreciate the help.
I remember when Albert was born.
Such an exciting time.
But also a difficult one.
I had no idea how to care for myself, not to mention a child.
With any luck I can help spare you the worst of them.
What else am I here for?
Now, shall we go to the market to stock your pantry?
I've got to go to the library.
I was hoping you could look after Hans for a few hours?
But with the rest of his life?
He's quite hopeless.
Lucky for him, he has a wife.
So if you wouldn't mind...
Marcel told me everything.
It's quite all right
I don't mind easing your burden, and I'm grateful just to have the job.
But of course, I'm curious...
[Muffled laugh].
How?
I, I'm sorry, what is Castile?
I told her we needed help with the house and the baby.
She's trying to turn me into a hausfrau.
Tell her that our work together is important.
That my part in it is important.
Make her feel appreciated.
Now...
Look.
That cannot...
Who did you say?
The fellow from Bern.
I lectured there recently.
I don't recall any Einstein...
He's a patent clerk.
I'm sorry you didn't receive the response you anticipated.
The old masters demand data.
Oh well, perhaps the third time will be the charm, as they say...
My God, Albert, you're writing another one?
Mileva's doing some research for me...

Your mother is here.
Now is that fair?
A good income.
Your father would be very proud
Pursue your dreams if you wish.
But don't give Mileva false expectations.
I will not be here forever.
She must be taught to run a house.
A single pollen particle is bombarded by water molecules ten-to-the-twenty-four times per second.
[Baby crying]
Mileva.
He's crying now.
But right now Albert needs my help.
This home needs you.
I'm not your maid, nor your child's wet nurse.
Very ambitious.
A single pollen particle is bombarded by water molecules
And trying to solve those equations in three dimensions will drive you mad.
Why not construct a one-dimensional model.
It's much simpler and would still prove your thesis.
The wind nearly threw me off my feet.
[Door slams]
Sorry I'm late.
Michele's great insight.
We calculate in one dimension!
It's so...
Elegant.
If I had as much to drink as Michele,
I'd be staggering everywhere, yes?
To the bar, the toilet, to the street?
We've been over this...
Michele helped me see that we can't predict exactly where
I'll go, but using simpler math, we can calculate how far I'll go over a period of time.
Exactly.
I proved the existence of molecules and nobody believed me.
And now I've proved how they move, and it can be confirmed with an ordinary microscope!
We both know it was only a gesture of consolation.
Philipp, that was four years ago.
Perhaps if I had received more recognition from my colleagues...
This patent clerk in Bern for instance.
He's cited both of us in a paper on...
You see?
I dismissed him at first.
But clearly he's an intellect.
I've been in correspondence with him in fact.
He wants the footlights, that much is clear.
I only hope he doesn't try to take recognition for your work like Rontgen did to me.
Ein-stein.
It is fascinating what one can deduce about a man just by knowing his name.
They're giving him the Nobel.
For cathode ray tubes a ten-year-old innovation.
And yes, I'm not ashamed to say,
I want some recognition for my contributions.
It's as if I am...
It's time to put away such indulgences and concentrate on what's expected of me.
♪
Albert?
I'm worried about you...
Every minute, it sends a signal at the speed of light to clocks in Geneva, Basel and Zurich, synchronizing them.
But what if we sent a signal to a clock on a moving train?
Turn your mind off for a bit.
Now listen.
A clock is here, stationary.
And now I attempt to synchronize it with one that is moving.
What happens?
Light would have to speed up or slow down to keep the clocks synchronized.
But James Clark Maxwell says that light only moves at one speed.
Now either Maxwell is correct, or Newton is.
But it can't be both.
I'm afraid poor Maxwell gets it between the eyes.
Come on.
I'll buy you dinner, and we can think some more.
The bloated windbags can't stop us from doing that, can they?
But Anna can.
Your eggs are getting cold!
Sit down.
Eat your breakfast.
No.
Amen.
I should be at the funeral.
I couldn't possibly leave you alone with the child.
Albert is exactly where he needs to be right now.
When you left for university?
I don't, I'm sorry.
I'm not as brilliant as I thought I was...
I'm sorry, Marie.
For everything.
He misses you.
So perhaps you can explain to me this:
How could my bright, beautiful son so suddenly turn into a monster?
What did I do wrong?
I wish I could be half the father that you are.
Hold him tight, Albert.
You think his childhood will last forever, but I promise you, it will pass in a fraction of a second.
By the time it seemed appropriate to leave,
I'd already missed my last train.
I'm sure you were terribly disappointed to have to spend the night with your beloved Wintelers.
You do what you want, go where you please.
And I'm here.
Not in a laboratory or in front of a classroom as I should be...
You need a wife to make you a home, not a...
We're partners.
You are not his partner.
You are his librarian.
You are his clerk.
[Baby crying]
[Baby crying]
I don't know what to do...
I can take him.
Choo-choo, choo-choo.
It's a train, yes.
I was on one of these this morning, and I couldn't wait to get home to see you.
Papa Jost told me that time is fleeting;
we think moments like these will last forever, but in fact they'll pass in a split second.
It's a nice sentiment, but you and I both know that time can't move at different speeds.
[Ticking clock]
Unless...
Unless it could.
Oh my...
Albertli, you've done it!
I've completely solved the problem.
Pretend you're overlooking a train track...
Imagine a train racing past, faster than any train you've ever seen.
Now, I want you to imagine, as the train is flying past, two lightning bolts crashing beyond the tracks at the same time 100 meters apart.
Now imagine that you're standing in the middle of the train during the exact same scenario.
Would the lightning bolts be simultaneous?
Close your eyes.
Do it, Michele!
Now watch the lightning bolts!
Were they simultaneous to you?
To me, standing still, they were simultaneous.
How could the two of us experience the same event differently?
Unless...
It's Newton.
I dare them to ignore it.
[Laughing].
Ha!
[Coughing]
Come see what we've found...
Don't look.
You believed it would be 1,000 times stronger than uranium.
This element is a million times stronger, and it's not even pure.
Thank God.
Since I first imagined riding alongside a light beam, it's been bothering me.
How could light freeze in time?
Well, it couldn't!
Do I not at least deserve a "hello?"
So, I've devised my own principle of relativity.
He saw time dilation as a mathematical quirk.
It's not.
The faster we move through space, the slower we move through time.
It's the redefinition of the universe.
All the work.
All the late nights.
This, Mileva.
This is what we've been chasing...
Will you proof it for me?
Is that it?
You're my partner.
Albertli, you brilliant little man!
[Knock]
I just received a letter from Stockholm.
You are to be awarded the 1903 Nobel prize in physics for your contributions to the research of radiation phenomena.
A hearty congratulations, Pierre.
But it's the tools you invented that are responsible for discovering radium.
People do.
Madam Curie and I are partners.
Please inform the Nobel committee that I will not accept the prize if they do not honor my wife alongside me.
Mileva: "The introduction of a luminiferous ether will prove to be superfluous."
Superfluous!
I love that word.
Mileva: "In conclusion, I wish to say that in working at the problem here dealt with, I have had the loyal assistance of my friend and colleague M. Besso...
And that I am indebted to him for several valuable suggestions."
You thank Michele.
His advice was instrumental.
Including this one.
It's our name.
Einstein, 'one stone.' this paper, every paper, it's both of us.
I couldn't do any of it without you.
You know that.
Planck: 'On the electrodynamics of moving bodies' by Albert Einstein?
I haven't seen anything like this since Newton's annus mirabilis.
Einstein to sir Isaac Newton?
Herr Einstein?
Max Laue, I work for Professor Max Planck at the
Prussian Academy.
A sincere pleasure to...
I've tried to get him to brush his hair and smarten himself up.
But the man is hopeless.
Author of the principle of relativity?
I simply provided a revision.
I am here at the behest of Professor Max Planck.
The father of Prussian physics?
You've achieved more in one year than most scientists do in a lifetime.
However did you accomplish it?
We would like to help you further your career.
Tell me, are you working on anything else?
I've realized that the relativity principle, combined with the Maxwell's equations, requires that mass be a direct measure of the energy contained in a body.
For all I know, the good lord might be laughing at the whole matter.
I believe this theory could be tested using elements whose energy is highly unstable.
Madame Curie's radium, for example...
It's genius.
