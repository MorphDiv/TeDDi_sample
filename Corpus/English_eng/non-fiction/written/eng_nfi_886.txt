Oh, Princess Twilight, everypony at the hospital is so excited for visit today.
I'm never too busy to visit sick foals!

On school picture day, too!
Oh!

We'll bring snacks;

Food and presents always cheer me up!
We'll see you soon.
OK, if we want to be at the hospital by lunch, then we have three hours to buy get-well presents, borrow a book from the schoolhouse and pick up treats.
It's a lot, but if we stick to the schedule,
I know we can get it all done.
Yeah, knock on wood!
[knock at door]
Surprise!
[baby giggle]
Oh!

How's my favorite niece?
[high voice] I'm good!

I hope you're not too busy!
Actually, we kind of are...
Busy?

[kissing sounds] [giggles]
Flur-ry, I've got a surprise for you!
Just a couple of toys that reminded me of Flurry!
[clatter]
[Flurry gurgles with excitement]
I've done some shopping for Flurry Heart!
You're so sweet.

I know, but I can't help myself!
Best!

Open this one, Flurry!
[baby talk] [growl] [laugh]
Exactly!

We'll just put Flurry's things over here, Twiley!
Uh huh, totally!
Mashed peas:

And diapers, extra diapers, oh and backup extra diapers.
Mashed peas: her favorite.

Uh-huh.
Oh!

Her "whammy".
I take it Flurry named it?
Yup.

You getting all this, Twiley?
Whammy!

You remember my friend from the royal guard, Spearhead?
Honestly, all of your friends' names are very similar.
Well, he has a pop-up art show at the Ponyville Cafe and we decided to go at the last minute.
We're not exactly art enthusiasts but we could really use a night out.
That's what I said.

Either way, are you sure you can watch her?
Uh uh uh!
Have no fear!

♪♪ [kiss]
Thanks again, Twiley!
OK, let's grab that wharmmy thing and go!
Ooh, you wanna pretend we're the bears?
I suppose we have time for a quick game.
Do we though?
Hey!
All right, rawr!

[squeak]
Agh!
[sigh]
You should catch her soon cause we've got lots to do!
Horsey-hive covered foals counting on us, remember?
Got it.

[squeal]
Uh oh.

[knock knock]
It's OK!

You know, that was a very advanced spell for somepony your age.
Looks like you're already taking after your Auntie Twiley!
All right, that was pretty adorable.

I know, Spike.

[stomach growls]
I just have to feed her real quick.
Is this art...

I have no idea.
But who cares?

Shining Armor!

Give me some hoof!
It is so!

Of course!

Loving all the art!
Uh, that's a trash can.
So it is.

But hey, who's to say it's not art?
Art can be anything that speaks to you.
It changed my world.
This is my latest piece:

Wow, I guess nighttime in a hallway can be pretty dark.
There is none more dark.
Yeah.

We're just so happy to be here!
Usually we're covered in mashed peas by now.
When they said mashed peas were her favorite... [splat] [giggle]
did they mean her favorite thing to decorate a room with?
[giggle]
Aw, come on, Spike.

Yeah and we're only twenty minutes behind schedule.
Twenty minutes?

[splat] [weak laugh]
OK, we just need to grab some toys and we are out of here!
Rawrr!
Well, I know a game that's even more fun... and more efficient.
Playing race cart!

[excited shouts]
Woohoo!
[baby giggles] [panting]
Hey, nice thinking, Twilight!
Best-Aunt-Ever!
Hang on, Flurry.

[giggling and happy shouts] [crash]
I'm not a detective, but I think we've got a suspect.
Ah!
[sigh]
Well, we'd better get to cleaning.
We've got no time to waste!
Thanks, but they were organized by color.
[sigh]
Yes!

Yeah, but if you add that to the 40 minutes we were already behind, we're still... 55 minutes behind.
I mean... yay, team?
Mmhmm!
Thanks for helping us out, Cheerilee!

Oh, no problem!
But I gotta say, I'm surprised you came to me for a book.

Yes, but...

I didn't think the foals would be interested in The Unabridged History of Amulets in Pony Latin.
Yeah.

How about the complete collection of "Ponyville Fables and Stables"
Mm, too long.
"Alien Alicorns vs. Space Pirates"?
Well, the science there is preposterous.
How about Burnferno:

It's about a handsome dragon warrior who slays evildoers with his breath and his snappy comebacks!
Let's borrow that for you and keep looking.

♪♪
How about "Gusty the Great"?
Ooh!

Um... should I go with something more current?
[gasp]
♪ Ta da!

Cheerilee!

There!

Great.

[groan]
This one's called 'A Kitchen Guard's journey'.
Oh...
This reminds me of the time
Flurry got into the chocolate pudding and we found little chocolate hoofprints all over the carpet.
That took forever to clean up!
But remember how cute her little face looked when we caught her?
Yeah she was like... uh oh!
[laughter]
Whoa!

I wasn't even going for that memory!

Honestly, Twilight, I don't even want to tell you how late we are.
Should I just cancel our visit to the hospital?
What?

The sick foals are counting on us!
And the B.A.E. would never throw in the towel like that!
B.A.E.?
Best-Aunt-Ever!
Besides, this errand is going to be different!
How do you figure that?
Because Flurry can play with the Cake twins and stay out of trouble!

♪♪ [baby cooing]
Wonderful, they're friends already!
Huh!

Thanks.

Spike, you watch Flurry;

Hi Pinkie, how's it going?

I'm good.

Do you still have a giant file of everypony's favorite treat?
In my secret party planning cave.
[ding]
BRB!
He he!

Cheerilee?
I am pretty awesome.
Cherry oatmeal cookies with yellow sprinkles.
Great!

I've got a stamp for that.
[angry sounds]
Hey, you guys.

Hang on!

Hold on, sweetie!

The salespony at the toy store.
Apple strudel cupcake with caramel drizzle!
Oh, no.

♪♪ [horror movie stings]
Pinkie, remind me what your favorite treat is.
The sampler platter.
We'll take three of those.
A-ha!

Heh heh.
[splat]
♪♪
Uh, Twilight!
Out of the question!

It's going to be OK!

That it can't possibly end up [splat]
Sorry.
No, I needed it.
I was just gonna say... we're here.
And we're only four-and-a-half minutes late!
Four-and-a-half?
"And while nopony had ever tried to reach Cloudsdale on hoof, Gusty the Great was not deterred.
She and her unicorn warriors marched up the hill...
But suddenly they encountered..."
What?

"It was the treacherous Grogar!
And Gusty could tell he was ready for battle.
Gusty called out to the unicorn warriors..."
OW!"
Not right now, Flurry, these foals really want to hear this.
[crying]
"'We can fight Grogar...

And the unicorn warriors shot magical beams into the clouds that wove into one.
The beam, stronger than a thousand armies, shined down.
It wrapped around Grogar and pulled him to the ground.
Don't let him escape!

Say aaaaah!
Aah!

Get us down, please!

FLURRY HEART!

Is everypony OK?
Flurry that was very, very bad!
You could have hurt somepony.
[bawling]
Oh, Flurry, I didn't mean to...
Sweetie, you don't have to be scared; it's just me.

Oh.

Like a big teddy bear.
Flurry, I'm so sorry.

All you wanted to do was play and I've barely been able to pay attention to you.
None of this is your fault.

So much for being the Best Aunt Ever.
But I hope you know how much I love you.
[giggle]
I take it you forgive me?
Thanks, Flurry.

After we find your whammy, of course!
Ahem!
And clean up.
This one kind of reminds me of Flurry's hair.
And this one reminds me of Flurry, too.
How so?
It's small, like her.
I can't do this anymore.
Spearhead, this has been great but...
Say no more.
My art has always spoken to me about what I love, but knowing that it spoke to you about what you love, speaks to me.
What?
Go to her!

Flurry?

Ho!

But it looks like you had a great time without us.
Actually, not so much.

But it wasn't her fault.
I shouldn't have agreed to watch her with such a jam-packed schedule.
It was too much to juggle.
But Flurry taught me an important lesson today.
It turns out being the Best Aunt Ever isn't about spending the most time with your niece, but spending quality time with her.
And she taught me a really cool "bear" game, so I guess I learned two things.
[laughter]
Well, we definitely should have given you more of a head's up.
Yes!

That would be great!
Hey, what are you doing next Tuesday?
For dinner!

I'll have to check with Spike, but I think we're free.
Where is Spike, anyway?
"the dashing dragon warrior breathed a scorching flame from his snout then chuckled to himself as he flew into the sunset.
'If you can't stand the heat, don't fight a dragon..'"
Hey, you kinda look like him!
Thank you.
OK.
