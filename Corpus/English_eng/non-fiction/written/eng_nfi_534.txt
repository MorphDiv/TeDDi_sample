"I was waiting for you to drive me to your house to play with all my tight holes."
But why are you just waiting on the kerb and how did you know that he'd be there?
"I've even got a daughter that looks like you."
OK, well that's just 100% disgustingness, innit?
"My feelings are so intense."
My mum is away for the first night since I was born and this is what...
No, man, I can't watch this stuff no more.
Cos, one day, I was, like, rah, hold on!
If there's a camera that close to my face, she must know the stare.
This some kind of acting, or something?
From time I realised that, yeah, me and my pillow are losing interest.
See, my mind, yeah, is woke.
I don't think they're having sex, it's some kind of motion graphics or something.
She look like that blonde chick from Homeland.
Why is she messing with this tired and retired brokeback man?
No, no, no, I can't make one, you know.
So I've been there for the whole of this relationship...
Three is a bit of a crowd.
Yeah, we are the three.
But it's a bit of a crowd, babe.
Yeah, I see what you mean.
Sexual liberation planner, here we go.
Be commercially attractive.
Safe alcohol abuse.
Dear God, I pray you send me a man with whom I have a connection who will release the virginity from my thighs and thus I will be liberated.
Amen.
♪ I'm going, holiday. ♪
You need to tell them they're not coming.
Why do you always have to go on like your balls ain't dropped yet?
That's how girlfriends keep their boyfriends these days, yeah?
So, guys, you said three was a bit of a crowd.
So now we are four of a crowd.
♪ Italy, 2013, Italy, 2013. ♪
What are you doing?
Well, I've heard people chant all sorts of places and years.
When they are going to go on...
It must be weird, living with your mum and dad.
The train, the train.
Make sure you lubricate the finger/fingers.
Where is Ola?
Aaron, Tracy, Candice!
Mark and Ian are my new friends.
I don't usually like other browns.
So you are here for one night only?
It's two minutes from mine but I don't think you should just go off with him.
Ooh.
Yes, black people, I'm a member of many private minority groups.
Black, gay, the working classes,
Apple crumble!
Where to find a man.
Are you lost?
Yes, I've walked too far from home.
What's the road?
Clavell Street, Pensbourne Estate.
Would you like to take me there?
Pensbourne Estate is just round the corner.
Well then, let's go.
Aaron, you never told me your mum and dad were living like Drake.
She sent "Sorry."
Ah, fuck!
Come on, come on, man!
Well, I like games, board games...
Why are you telling me this?
Well, because you should have asked already.
And as my sister Tracy will be back tomorrow,
I don't want to waste any time that's all.
You're the one that brought me here.
I'd like a cup of wine, please.
There's a bottle and two cups on the hatch.
Hope you're having as good a time as I am.
Mag-a-luf 2014!
Mag-al-uf 2015.
Mag-a-luf 2013.
OK, I'm ready.
For what?
To fuck.
See ya.
He's probably got a drip hidden... in his muscular bum.
I've never seen an ugly man with booty like that, OK?
Why's there got to be sexual feelings involved?
What's all the noise?
We were just saying how lovely your house is and how welcoming you've been.
That's a lot of shite, isn't it?
Oh.
You know, girls like this.
"Hi, I'm Clarissa."
"Oh, my gosh, you're gay."
Oh, Derek's at Freedom's.
Derek, look at you!
Ian, you look tired.
Well, this has been fun.
You don't need a cab or something?
It's just round the corner, isn't it?
Text me your snapchat and we'll keep in touch, yeah?
I want to slap my face with it.
Yes.
So I would really appreciate it if that happened.
No, no, no, we can't.
He has been so nice to me.
How long do you think he will take?
Well, the shop is a very long walk away.
Thank you, Jesus.
Tracey!
Oh, come on.
You've got to admit he's all right.
Just keep your eyes on the TV.
Candice, that's hard, and I'm on holiday.
Fuckin' Barnes, reffing.
One red card, fucking hundreds to go.
Actually, Dad, I've been body-building and that.
What, like a gay?
What are you doing, drinking protein shakes?
Trying to drop that baby fat?
Try dropping your balls first, son.
I've just said that same thing today.
What are you saying about my son?
He didn't have any biceps.
Got some big man boots in London, have you?
Now he's wearing them, but do they fit?
Are you sure you're a big man?
What have you got?
What have you got in them triceps, eh?
Right, so you want to do sex?
Are you just going to give it to me?
Well, I'm not giving it to you, we're sharing it!
This ain't a set-up?
There ain't no cameras here?
I've broken my hymen in preparation, so I'll lie down.
And, er...
At my pace, please!
And now just put it around my knicker area.
OK.
And now, enter the dome, with your penis.
Are you enjoying it?
Yes, but if you keep talking, it's going to go down.
Is it tight?
OK, you can say stuff like that.
Is it tight?
Virgin tightness has been scientifically debunked.
Intercourse does not stretch the vagina...
Well, it does, but it just shrinks it down to what it was before, so that means, if we do this again, we'll be having the exact same experience we're having right now.
Are you having fun?
Hey, Ian, I'm back!
Oh, Jesus!
Don't worry.
Where did you put all the fucking snacks?
Right, well,
I guess I've just got to be honest.
Yes, I...
I totally fancy you.
I don't know how you feel, you don't have to say...
Actually, no, how do you feel?
I'm hungry.
My feelings are so intense.
Right, Aaron, this is serious, then, is it?
Yeah, I love her.
Where you from, Candice?
I guess some sort of council block?
You've got backup funds?
Are you spiritual?
Because my assumption, right, is that the answer to these questions are no, no, and no.
At the end of the day, what are you doing to increase his points as a man?
He is now very angry and saying very crazy things.
I'm the one that's working.
Even on a superficial level, yes, you've got a face, you're nice and light, but where's your bum?
That's significant.
Aaron, I told you.
You want a girl to look like she's dying!
Anorexic here, morbidly obese here and here!
OK, well, I'd love to see your wife.
So would I. Slut.
Aaron, aren't you going to do anything?
Men do things, boys do Buddha chants.
Oh, son, you've got to do some legwork.
Aaron!
Look, I know it's not going to happen tonight because the atmosphere's a bit tense, but can you guys do the wrestling thing again before you go...
Oh, he knows I'm only playing with him.
You've got to be cruel to be kind to make a man.
Let me know when that man is made.
No, in all honesty, you're probably a lovely girl.
I hope he's taking good care of you.
Thanks.
You look a lot like her, you know.
Come on, you've got to be cruel to be kind to make a woman, too.
You haven't even learnt the easiest trick in the book.
Treat 'em mean.
How do you think this is going, Ryan?
I going to come, I'm going to come!
Aah, aah... !
I did a big come!
My toes have gone all numb.
Well, then again, girls don't always squirt, so the same must be true for boys.
Good work, Ryan!
Do you mind if I take a nap?
And also, there's something very exhausting about you.
OK, I guess.
But you have to stay here in my sister's room.
Why are we in your sister's room?
Because I heard that sex sometimes smells, and if there's an odour,
I want my mum to think it's her sex, not mine.
Oh, yes, I read that falling asleep together can create emotional attachment in women, and I have no desire to see you again, so I will sleep in my room.
Aargh!
Tracey!
Ola, are you off your rocket?
Yeah, Ola, he's in a wheelchair!
Not the fucking wheelchair, my fucking clothes!
Ola, get this shit off of me!
I was stressed, he was going to catch us!
He has a fantasy thing.
You came along and we saw an opportunity.
I mean, we were texting each other the whole time, since the train journey.
OK, I can see you may have found it deceptive.
I can't say I'm offended.
No, it's "I can't say I'm NOT offended."
No, I mean to say, I'm really not offended.
I mean, you know, let's go and discuss this in the cottage.
Are you going to have sex?
Mm-hm.
Oh, fuck.
I thought mixed race people were supposed to be more evolved!
Supposed to be the smart ones!
That is the dumbest thing I've ever seen!
Tracey, can you not see that he's everything
I've been telling Aaron to be from time?
Why does everything up always have to be about you?
Oh, OK.
Got caught out, so now you're trying to beef, yeah?
Wash your bum crack, Candice, I can smell the guilt from here!
It was just some lame dry hump thing.
Oh, sorry, now you will have to tell him.
Oh, isn't he going to ask why you're breaking up, duh, you dodo head?
Maybe I might just run away, like you.
You've got till 12:24pm tomorrow to tell him or I will.
Just go to bed.
I didn't even need to kick him out.
12:24.
She knows I'm not ain't going to say nothing, she's my best mate.
Treating you like the shit off me shoe, you're my son!
To be honest, Dad, it's Candice you should be apologising to.
I think we both took advantage of each other.
What's the point in talking about it?
What's happened?
She got off with me, didn't she?
You fucking prick.
Just going to take five, if that's all right.
It was hardly anything.
Things are getting tense in the Big Brother house.
Just in case you're still wondering if I'm interested in you sexually...
I like it, it's part of it, you know?
I left my number in there.
I'm sorry.
If you want me to be more like my dad, ask me directly,
And I don't want you to be anything like him.
I want to get married.
Well, we can't just do it now, there's no church.
You know what I mean, when we get back and that.
I'm never talking to him again.
Oh, Ola!
I can't even go back in there, I don't know what I'll do to him.
Just grab the bags and ignore him.
You're right, I can feel it.
What happened?
Basically, Aaron's dad told me he was in love with me, but I told him I wasn't interested.
I'm sorry, Mummy!
I'm sorry.
I don't deserve you.
I did.
I promise.
Well, fuck yourself, then!
