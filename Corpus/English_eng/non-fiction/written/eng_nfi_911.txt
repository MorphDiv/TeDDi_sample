Alice.

Uh-oh.
So, I am in the market for a prom date.
Prom.

Anyway, when you went to prom, what did your Prince Charming say to sweep you off your feet?
I need the exact string of words.
I actually didn't go to prom.
Oh, 'cause, like, prom hadn't been invented yet?
No.
Prom just wasn't my thing.

Oh, great.

This one cute guy said, "You are the single most beautiful rose in the desert wasteland that is European History since 1500, milady.
Will you go to prom with me?"
Okay, I just recorded everything you said with voice-to-text,
I'm deleting that boring history stuff, and send.
Send?
No send, Andy.
You can't send it in a text, you have to ask in person.
Oh, no, that would take way too long.
Look, I just sent this to 37 different girls in my school.
You know.

- [Cellphone vibrates]

Well, it's a numbers game.
I'm not worried.
- [Cellphone vibrating] - "No." "No."
- "Unsubscribe"?

Well, at least they're replying to me in a timely fashion.
And in all caps.
- Andy...

Yay!

- Is Dora home?

Some dork is at the door!
Oops, I forgot to use my inside voice.
Gabe?
Oh, crap.
Three, four.
♪ Hold on, little girl ♪
♪ Show me what he's done to you ♪
♪ Stand up, little girl ♪
♪ A broken heart can't be that bad ♪
What the hell is happening?
It's so adorable.
Dora's being asked to the prom by some dude named Gabe.
♪ So come on, baby, come on over ♪
♪ Let me be the one to show you ♪
♪ I'm the one who wants to go ♪
♪ To prom with you ♪
- Oh.

Poor, stupid Gabe.
♪ I know you feel it, too ♪
Yeah, I'm gonna stop you right there.
Uh, I don't feel it, too.
Prom's not really my thing.
I guess what I'm trying to say is...
Thank you for the opportunity.
Dora:

Sorry.
She said no.
Mary:

When she was a kid, she dreamed up me to be her bff.
Now my girl has finally fallen in love, but she's in way over her head, so I'm back to help.
I've got this all figured out.
- No, you don't.

I cannot believe Dora said no to that adorable prom proposal.
The old wound is reopened now.
I should've gone to prom.

That's your biggest regret?
I've seen you eat a hot dog you dropped in the subway.
I've seen you punch a bird.
I didn't punch the bird, the bird flew at my face and I gently shooed it to the ground.
This is gently shooing.
This...

But whatever.

I'm gonna go talk to Dora.
So no one asked you to prom because you punched a bird?
No, people thought I punched the bird, but that's not... my main point.
[Sighs]
I always got asked to prom, and I always said no, and then in my senior year, when I actually wanted to go, no one asked.
Okay.
Maybe prom was cool back in your day when it was invented...
How old do you guys think I am?
Point is, prom is lame.
All the dressing up, the popular music, the outdated gender norms.
Prom's never, like, like, cool.
Like in the movie "Carrie."
Every now and then, pop music and outdated gender norms can be fun, Dora.
I don't know.
Plus, I thought Gabe's prom-posal was pretty brave.
Yeah, it does take a certain amount of courage to look like an idiot.
There is something kind of, like, mysterious about trombonists.
Sure.
[Chuckles]
- Is Dora here?

Bro, bro, bro.
Dad, I got this.
Three, four.
♪ Will you go to prom ♪
♪ With Gabe Bernstein?

- ♪ He is quite respectful ♪

- ♪ For a teen ♪

Please.

Don't make me change my mind.
- Yes!

Thanks, Dora.

You sure are.
Bye.
Yes!
Whoa, whoa.

I thought prom wasn't your thing.
It's not, but Alice kind of freaked me out, and I don't want to end up like her.
That is so insulting and you took my advice!
- [Grunts]

Ben, can we do prom pictures here?
No.

It's just that...
Dora can't go.
- What?

Look, you're Andy's little sister.
You can't go to prom before him.
It'll send him off the deep end.
Oh.
That's why we have the Andy Rule...
You can't achieve milestones before him.
It's not worth it.
You could've said something before I told Gabe to ask me again.
You were so insistent that prom was for suck-ass douche lords that I didn't think I had to.
So if Andy gets a date, then I can go?
Absolutely.
So it's not happening.
Hopefully, Gabe will understand.
Oh, poor kid.
Poor kid?

You almost blew it!
All your prom talk almost got inside Dora's head.
Wait, what are you saying?
I'm saying I don't want Dora to go to prom because she's my little baby Princess.
So you're hiding behind Andy's lack of game to keep Dora from taking part in a rite of passage?
No, it's not like that.
Prom is just different for boys.

Yeah, I get it.

No, it's two single and equal standards that I choose to measure differently.
Oh, God!
Sorry, just mixing up my entrances.
We're totally calling him out on this double standard garbagio and getting Andy a date, right?
Oh, hell, yeah.
Slipping, slipping!

Hey, champ.
How's it going on the prom front?
It's good.

I'm down to four girls.
- [Cellphone vibrates]

You didn't even look.
Eh.

Okay.
So, clearly mass-texting your entire class was not the way to go.
Well, I didn't text everybody.
I can work with that.
Gonna call out some lady names here.
And they're all crossed out.
Laura Wadler.
Boom.

- She starts fires.

Denise Bagley.
- She's super nice and cute.

But she's going with Jennifer Gomez.
To elaborate, they're lovers.
[Clicks tongue] Gotcha. [Gasps]
Aww, Clara Chang.
Wasn't she in Dora's play with you?

Man, I...

I like her and stuff.
Wait.

Well, it's more like love. [Chuckles]
Dude!

A-Again, because I love her.
I mean, what if she says no to me?
That would actually hurt my feelings.
Andy, you're just trying to protect your little heart.
Oh, actually, the doctor says it's enlarged.
But yeah.
One no from Clara, that... that would... that would be worse than a thousand nos from all these girls.
Andy, you just got to take a chance.
I mean, look at me and your dad.
If he hadn't sacked up and asked me out, we wouldn't be here now.
You're right.

- I am.

Okay.
[Clears throat]
- "Prom," question mark...

Oh, no.
Oh, I-I-I just sent it, and autocorrect changed it from "prom" to "porn."
What?

I don't know!

Clearly, I've been hacked.
I've been hacked by a gross, shameful, naturally curious person.
Let's just move on.
We will start by letting go of this.
We are going to ask Clara the right way, with a big romantic display, just like all the kids are doing now.
Okay.

- Okay.

- Oh, God.

I'm about to ask out Clara.
Is that right?

Andy, relax.

Yeah, okay.

Uh, uh...
[Gasps] Oh, no.
Why'd you throw a rock?

There were no pebbles!
What about the doorbell?
How am I supposed to hit the doorbell with a rock?

Alice, come on!
[Gasps]
No.

Oh, please, don't... stop!
This can't be happening!
If you were gonna do it, at least finish your job!
- Come back, please!

- Sir!

What's happening?
[Chuckles] It's a funny story.

Hey, Clara.

Well, you texted me the word "porn,"
then broke my window, and also wrote, "Clara, do me," on the street.
Hmm.

So... are you asking me to prom or what?
Uh, uh...
Yes, he's asking you to prom.
Cool.

My parents are irate.

So, still yes.
Great.

Okay. [Chuckles] Bye.
Okay. [Chuckles] Bye.
Okay.

Okay, bye.
She said yes.
- Again!

Dora, we talked about this.
You can't go unless you-know-who gets a you-know-what, which will happen when you-know-where freezes over.
You didn't hear?
Andy, tell dad the good news.
You have to pay $358 for a broken window.
What?
And I got a date to prom.
- I got a date to prom.

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

- Yes.

Yes!
All thanks to Alice.
She literally asked for me.
I mean, she said the words and everything.
Alice, you are the best.
Now I get to go to prom!
Good thing you clearly laid out those super specific rules.
You are the best, Alice.
Okay, I know this is not what you intended, but this is a very big moment!
Dora took my advice;
Andy, thanks to me, gets a date with the girl he loves.
I mean, this is great!

- Mm.

Oh, damn, he is pissed!
Do you think I went too far helping Andy?
Hell, No.

All day.

No, it's not.

Shut up.

Okay, you're super angry.

Well, maybe because you stormed out, and now you're furiously slathering mayo on what's shaping up to be a multi-decker hate sandwich.
Well, it's just, I told you I didn't want
Dora to go to prom, and you forced it to happen.
I'm sorry, it's just I know what it's like to miss out, and I don't want Dora to go through that.
Did you hear her with that Gabe?
[As Dora] "Okay, bye.

You know what I heard?
"Okay, bye, innocence.

You're overreacting.

- Prom is a gateway dance.

She's growing up, and it's scary and overwhelming and sad, and pass me the pickle chips.
- [Pickles plop]

Whatever, fine.

The only thing I can control is this sandwich.
Damn it!
- Okay, Andy, put your arm around Clara.

Andy, lose the hover hand.
The what?
Well, your hand's just floating high above her.
It's okay, you can touch my shoulder.
But it's so bare and well-moisturized.
Look, I like you, dude.

You're kind of an oddball.
Thank you.

Damn!

- Is it?

Excuse us.
Ooh, sharp.
Uh, you know, I could probably pin that on myself.
Let me tell you something, Gabe.
I have a very particular set of skills, skills that I have acquired over a very long career, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.
Um, isn't that the Liam Neeson speech from the movie "Taken"?
Ooh.
Look who watches PG-13 movies.
Um...
Follow me, Gabe.
Okay.
You'll have my daughter returned home safe, and that'll be the end of it, Gabe.
I will not look for you.

But if you break curfew or her heart,
I will look for you.
I will find you.
And I will kill you.
[Both laugh]
It's a great movie, huh?
Love that line.
Anywho, have fun tonight.
Yay!
Okay, one last group shot.
Dora, where's Gabe?
Um, don't know.
He said he was going to the bathroom.
The downstairs bathroom?
'Cause I was just in there and the window was open,
- and the curtains were blowing.

- Oh, my God.

Gabe just ditched me.
- Oh, no.

Dad, what did you say to Gabe?
What?

'Cause this text says that in the interest of his personal safety, he thinks it's best if we never speak again.
[Scoffs] Classic Gabe.
Always freaking out for no reason.
[Cellphone chimes]
Alice: "To be absolutely clear, I think you're great, and the only reason I ran is 'cause your father threatened to take my life."
How could you do this to me?
'Cause I didn't want you to go to prom.
What about Andy?
Well, i-it's different with boys.
Dad, that's a full-on double standard against girls.
Oh, my God!
You tried to trick me with the Andy Rule.
Uh, hi, I'm...

Feeling like I deserve to know the Andy rule.
No, she said, "Andy rules." Go, Andy.
Dad said I couldn't go to prom unless you got a date, which he thought would never happen.
Andy:

Now I am standing here with my arm around...
That's right, all the way around...

Let's just go stand somewhere near the street.
