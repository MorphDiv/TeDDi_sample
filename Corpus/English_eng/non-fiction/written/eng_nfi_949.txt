Oh, Yolanda, thank god you're back!
Sorry, I had to convince them to give me Josh's painkillers.
They get real suspicious when you ask them the street value.
How's he doin'?
Terrible, I think he has amnesia!
He doesn't remember me or anyone or anything!
Oh, my damn!
Josh:

(theme music playing)
♪ She in the spotlight ♪
♪ And she turn my head ♪
♪ She run a red light ♪
♪ 'Cause she bad like that ♪
♪ I like that ooh, baby, ooh, baby ♪
♪ Baby, I like that ooh, baby, ooh, baby ♪
I don't understand why he remembers her and not me.
Well, memory loss is a tricky thing.
How is he?

Okay, he's... he's right over there, but, don't be upset if he doesn't remember...
Josh:

Josh!
You remember me!
Of course I do, buddy.

Oh my god, how does he remember everyone except for me?
Josh?

Do you remember when we were sitting on your couch, and...
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

You have to allow Josh to remember everything on his own.
Otherwise, it can cause a psychic meltdown!
I never miss an episode of General Hospital.
Um, Doctor, listen,
I...

I said something kind of major to him right before he got knocked out, and I really need to know what he was gonna say back.
I understand your frustration, but pushing' Josh can cause him such emotional distress, that he could block out even more.
Yeah, but god!

I mean, wh... wh... where'd you even go to medical school?
Harvard.
Wow, that's... that's really good, good for you.
Hey, guys...
I think I'm starting to remember something.
Hey, everybody.

Josh, you look fantastic.
Who travels 10 hours and looks this good?
Ha-ha, you!
How was your trip?
Aw, China was awesome!
Only problem is, you open a business there, an hour later you wanna open another one!
(both laughing)
(Elliot laughing)
Elliot, who's this?
Uh, hopefully your new chef... if I'm lucky!
Oh my god, I remember you.
You do?
Yeah, I remember everything exactly.
You were at my penthouse.

- Mm-hm.

What?
Yeah.
You were gonna make me an audition meal.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

And you never got the chance,
I...

I'll tell you what.
As soon as I get discharged, how about you come over and cook me that audition meal?
(laughs) Awesome!
Audition meal?
Do you believe this?

I've had for two years!
I don't understand.

Because this stupid smart Harvard doctor won't let me!
He said Josh has to remember everything by himself or it could cause a psychic meltdown.
It's basic brain stuff, Sofia, basic brain stuff.
Okay, okay, so you'll make your audition meal, he'll hire you and eventually he'll... get his memory back.
Yeah, but what if he doesn't?

I was telling Josh that I loved him.
I mean, what if he never remembers what he was gonna say back?
- He'll remember.

Because, Gabi, people remember feelings.
If anything, you should be happy that he wants you to make this audition meal.
Okay?

Grilled cheese?
This...

Mmm.
It's so ooey-gooey.
You know what?
Forget the other guy.

- Wha?

Oh my god!

All I have to do is make the same meal and the same things will happen, and then, Josh and I will be together, and then not together, and then together, and... and then not together, and then together and then not together.
Yeah.

Oh my god, I can do this, I have done this.
I'm gonna look for the dress I wore the first day.
Oh, and don't forget a dress for the wedding.
Sofia, my grilled cheese isn't that good.
Your Uncle Chris is getting married in Aspen.
What?
Yeah, his invitation got mixed into the pile of bills we use to even out our table legs.
Oh my god, he's getting married in Aspen this weekend,
- and he sent me two train tickets.

I'm not saying he copied me, but everyone knows that Aspen is my dream wedding location.
Oh my god...

Oh, I swear to god, if the bride's dad skis her down the aisle... (sighs) Can you think of a more romantic place to celebrate your love?
Oh, you're right.
I'm so happy for your uncle.
No no, I'm talkin' about me and Josh.
Come on!

Okay, now you're stealing my wedding ideas?
It is so much more romantic than telling me he loves me on a stupid couch!
Oh my god!

Hey, Elliot...
One moment, I'm just finishing up an interview.
With who?
(gasps)
Michael Voltaggio?
What is Top Chef Michael Voltaggio doing here?
Hi.

No.
Does anyone remember me?
No.

Elliot, what is he doing here?

Well, it's also a redo for me.
This time I want Josh to choose the right chef.
Listen, I wish I could stay to meet with Josh...
You can!

But due to a recent head injury, we're not supposed to wake... (yelling) Josh!
But it'll totally be worth it if you stay and meet... (yelling) Josh!
I'm sorry, I really gotta go.
I left some apps for Josh to taste, or... you guys can come to one of my restaurants.
Wh...

Elliot, I can't believe you would be so evil.
Really?

Morning, boss.

Mmm, better.

Hey...

Yeah.
See, I know you.

Uh-huh.

And I know exactly what you want to eat, because I am a food mind reader.
It's one of my super powers.
Oh, yeah?

A man.
She's good.
Here ya go.

I think you'll like it.
This...

Mm... doesn't taste fantastic.
What?

What are you talking about?

Uh, nothin' baby, nothin' at all.
Gabi!
Girl, what is wrong with you?
Do you want Josh to have a psychic meltdown?
I don't understand, he loved my grilled cheese.

Oh, his taste buds are all messed up.
Hayden used to love coffee, but after her concussion, just the smell of it made her sick.
Who's Hayden?
(sighs) From General Hospital !
The point is, Hayden got her memory back and so will Josh.
Oh my god, this is delicious.
(gasps)
That was fast.
Who made this?
Michael Voltaggio!
I'm sorry, Gabi, but Voltaggio's hired.
- No!

Call hot chef!
(screams)
What the hell are you doing?
Waiting to find out if Josh remembered anything!
Did he say anything about me?

Why haven't you returned any of my calls?
'Cause of this!
I'm sorry, it's just, what if Josh never remembers me, what if... what if he likes Top Chef Michael Voltaggio so much that he keeps him on as his chef, and I never have a reason to go back to Josh's
and he forgets me forever?
Um... uh...

I know!
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

Then help me.
Okay, uh, name it, how, I'll do anything.
Okay, the train to Aspen leaves tomorrow night.
Can you help me jog Josh's memory?
Nope.
But you just said that you'd help me.
Okay, first of all, the girls and I, don't jog.
More importantly, you heard that doctor.
He said we can't start messin' with Josh's mind by sayin' anything!
I know, I know, but what if we don't say anything, but we show him!
Oh my damn, Josh's childhood blanket that he lost in a fire and you recreated for his birthday!
Yeah!

You're right!
And he'll never forget that!
Yeah, so you'll help me?
You would think after all that, (laughs) but nope.
(cries)
(sing-songy) Michael V, it's Elliot P!
You remember Yolanda.

Of course, the only thing she's ever waxed is her mustache.
Hey, that's rude.
(laughs) Right?
So MV, we have an issue to deal with today.
What?

Your turn, Michael!
My turn for what?
To roast Elliot.

Fat, short, sweaty, let him have it.
I think that's really childish.
Isn't she?
Anyway, last night Alan and I got in a big fight, and I need you guys to help me fix it.
Okay, let's hear the plan.
- What plan?

I need you to dress up as Alan's long lost grandma and take my side in an argument, then...
What?

That's what we do around here.
Well, I don't.
Oh.

I would, but I'm too busy making this "I don't work for you" lunch.
Oh.
(laughing) Ooh-hoo!

You two are a piece of work.
And speaking of work, do you guys do any around here?
Say what?
Ohh... and when's the last time you cleaned out this fridge?
And I'm not talking about food.
(laughing) 'Scuse me for a minute.
Gabi?

(in a loud voice) Thank you for comin' and helping' me with my computer, Josh.
Yolanda:

Well, you know what?

Whoa...
Whoa, what?
I'm gettin' this really weird feeling.
This place seems familiar to me.
Hell, yeah, it does.
What is it about this place?
I don't know, but, um, maybe my keys are in the bed... uh, we should try the bed.
Let's try the bed!
Why would keys be in the bed?
Just look in the bed.
Am I in love with the girl that lives in this apartment?
- (gasps) - (gasps)
- What?

Hoo, out of breath from walkin' from there to here, it's just... (exhales)
I'm starting to remember.
Oh my god, Josh!

Did you get your memory back?
Yeah, I think I did.
Wh...

You're the girl that knows my heart.

(sighs)
- Ahh!

What do I do?
Tell me everything!

Do you feel the same way I do?

- Uh, dizzy.

She can't tell you how she feels, she's not allowed to answer, doctor's orders.
W...

- Uh...

I'm not gonna be responsible for that, get your ass up.
Wait... will you at least have dinner with me tonight?
- Uhhh...

Oh my god, this is so exciting, I can't believe I'm having dinner with...

(crying) What just happened?
Hey!

Where's Josh?

Gabi, why are you coming out the window, what's going on?
Why do you have arugula in your hair?
Well, I...

I stumbled back and I fell into the dumpster, now, where did he go?
Well, Yolanda took him home.
Oh, well, what did he say when... when you told him that I'm the one that made the blanket, and I'm the one that knows his heart?
I didn't tell him.
What?

Because you said I wasn't allowed to say any of that!
Everyone's tellin' me I'm not allowed to say any of that!
You didn't say anything?
No!

What?

Gabi, it was the only way he would leave.
Ohhh, was it, Sofia?
- Yeah, it was.

Mm-hm.

Well, how long did you let him kiss you before you pulled away?
Oh my...

- Did you like the kiss?

Did!

No!

Well, I do, okay?

I'm...

- But what about...

I'm having one!
Josh?

Whoa, whoa, how the hell did you get in here?
Because you made me a key, because I work here.
No, I gave the job to the other guy.
Not the first time, the first time you gave the job to me.
What first time?

Okay, I'm sorry.

I know...

All I remember is I interviewed you, and I didn't like your grilled cheese.
Ugghh!

That's the thing!

And then we got drunk and we slept together, and... which I don't expect you to remember because I barely remember it, but, we both regretted it because you were engaged, but then you broke off your engagement to be with me!
And then, we tried to be together, but we couldn't be together, because we argued a lot, because we're both very passionate people, but... then we came up with this idea of the punch card relationship, so we could have sex without the feelings,
but then, I did have feelings, and I told you that I loved you, and you were about to tell me if you loved me, but then the goddamn squirrel jumped out, and it made you hit your head
and forget everything, including the fact that I'm the one that made you that blanket that you found, because I'm the one that knows your heart.

Gabi...

You do?
Yes.

Ohh...
Oh, thank god.
But I don't remember it.
What?
I remember Elliot and Yolanda, and I remember my family, and all the feelings I had for them.
And I'm not sure how to say this, but...
I think if I loved you...
I'd remember it.
(Gabi crying)
(speaking incoherently)
I know, I know.
Actually, I don't know.
Could you speak a little clearer?
- Can you do me a favor?

Can you hit me over the head so I get amnesia so I can forget what Josh just told me, 'cause it was so hurtful!
Oh, Gabi, it's gonna be okay.
How?

I mean, we have two options here.

Or three, and don't forget about three, he remembers you, and was gonna tell you he does love you.
No, he doesn't love me, he says that it's over!
Are we in Aspen yet?
No, we haven't left yet.
What?

Oh!

Who wants to play Crazy Eights?
(crying)
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bar car and get a couple of drinks.
And something for you.
(crying)
Hey, Elliot.

Here you go, boss.
I charged it for you.
Oh.

I...

Well, you are forgetting one thing.
- What?

You do.
And I'm not just trying to take advantage of the fact that you have a traumatic brain injury.
- Okay.

Yeah, bring it in.
