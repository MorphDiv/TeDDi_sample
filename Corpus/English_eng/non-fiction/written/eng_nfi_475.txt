[cell door slams] [theme song playing]
[cell door slams]
[cell door slams] [inmates snoring]
- [music playing over speakers] - [inmates groaning] [inmate] Turn it off!
[inmates continue grumbling] [chuckles]
[cheering]
[radio host speaking indistinctly] [sighs]
[grunting and groaning]
[coughing] [all gagging]
[narrator on TV] In the Kalahari Desert, the unsuspecting meerkat clan is unaware they are prey to the desert's most savage predators.
[Nicky] Jesus Christ.
[narrator continues indistinctly] [grunts] Where's the remote?
Could somebody shut off those rats?
Look at them, standing up like little people.
[news anchor] Scattered reports this morning that Judy King has been taken hostage at Litchfield Penitentiary in what appears to be a possible terror situation.
You tellin' me that we could have gotten up to that roof?
Is that Yoga?
Absolutely not.
Live at the scene here at Litchfield Prison, as details continue to trickle in about the late-night terrorist attack on Judy King and her Christian faith.
Some reports indicate that there is a political and violent uprising taking place within the prison.
But News 4 has found exclusive online footage that tells quite a different story.
[inmates laughing and whooping]
That's where the chicken à la king went.
[woman over intercom] Mr. Pearson, the governor's on line one.
[beeps]
Why are al-Qaeda terrorists torturing the red states' favorite chef on the roof of your prison?
[Jack] Uh, look, I know it doesn't look good, but, uh...
It looks like a fucking PR nightmare during my election year.
Is that what CERT advised?
Do you not have a CERT team on the scene?
We're sort of between CERT teams right now.
You listen to their assessment of casualty risk and you let them de-escalate this mess.
Worse than when my beagle had butt cancer.
I'm so sorry to hear about Blanche.
Get your inmates off my TV.
You stepping' ass first?
If you wanna score the Latin and African American markets,
White, I just turn to the side, tits, ass.
And the schoolgirl outfits hits Asians.
We're gonna be super famous!
Pidge said I needed some drama on my face.
It was this or mascara, and I don't like shit around my eyes 'cause I got allergies and I rub and then I look like one of them girls who cry.
Uh, I'm totally liking it.
You should try doing the prune lips like an Olsen twin, like this.
[Flaca] Mmm.
[reporter] All right, can we just get the two on the right?
Never work with animals, children or naked buttholes.
[laughing] [chuckling] Why are you walking like you're 90?
[Piper] Because we slept in a digger bucket, and I can't feel my neck.
She stole me a ring off a corpse.
She left me for a professional water-skier.
She said she was the only woman who ever looked hot in a life vest.
How do you fight that?
That's, uh... that's pretty presumptuous.
Alex Vause, may I put my prison-issue mattress next to your bulldozer scoopie thingy, and ride out a nightmare with you?
You may.
Will I not like you when you get very angry?
[Alex] I'm repurposing.
Huh.
Do you want me to help you rip off the other one?
Is it driving you crazy?
No.
It's no corpse ring, but it'll have to do.
You found something to eat okay?
Why, you wanna jack me for my Pop-Tart?
This whole fucking time you didn't say nothing.
You weren't acting like a responsible gun owner.
I don't care.
We all think about taking down these cabrones, but we don't act on it 'cause we got things to live for.
You gotta get outta here and see your girl.
You need to take a timeout, okay?
Busy hands could help clear your head, huh?
My head hurts, all right?
I want nothing to do with you.
Maybe your shadow can help you play cleanup.
What's for breakfast?
You're looking at it.
Breakfast is supposed to be served between 4:30 and 7:00.
Today's offerings should include a hot grits, a whole wheat bread or coffee cake, a margarine pat and skim milk.
Breakfast is canceled...
Fine.
Breakfast, okay?
This is the surprise, for sure.
Um, by any chance, will there be a spoon made available?
[sighs]
[grunts]
Oh, what the hell.
No. [chuckles]
Oh.
You pay me to train.
In what?
I'd buff circles around these sashimi bitches.
Two weeks train, or you go now.
You know what, you can shit up a rope with your $20 a day.
And it's your loss.
I would have had this place packed, with lines out the door.
Charging people to work?
Mei... are you in here against your will?
How long does it take to fry, poach and scramble some damn eggs?
Did we say you could talk?
Yeah, just make it rain, King.
What the fuck did y'all do?
And they had no right to call us bin Ladens without checking who we were under those Ewok hats.
What's offensive is that a photograph of two idiots wearing hijabs automatically gets labelled as terrorism.
[Black Cindy] Hey, do I smell eggs?
No way, she's our slave.
Bitch, egg snot the best part.
Over easy's the only way to cook an egg.
Ain't that right, Jude?
Over medium is considered the gold standard.
Look, we need to borrow D-list Martha Stewart for a while.
We need to show the media that she ain't locked up in a closet with a bag over her head and jumper cables on her nips.
She's our property and we're not in the lending business.
That's Jews.
Nah, our whole lives is you people taking from us for free.
If you want her, you gotta buy her, like an American.
That's the deal.
[sighs]
What do you want for her?
What you got?
I think Boo's giving tree actually does more takin' away than giving.
But when it gets filled with cement, the tree symbolizes what's been taken from Scout, her innocence.
Okay, permission slips, people!
I need them before we get on the bus tomorrow.
Uh, Janae, I'd like to speak with you.
Doors are gonna open if you keep working hard, Janae.
I want you to see what's behind some of those doors.
I go to here, Spanish Harlem.
I know it looks messy and everything, but it's because we have that protest and everything.
My bunk is over there, and right here, we have Pidge and Ouija.
Okay, so over here, we have Maria.
I made this selfie stick out of a plunger and duct tape.
Look at the link below if you want directions.
And over here, we have my best friend, Maritza.
I already took my face off from this morning.
For the people.
[sighs] Okay, fine. [clears throat]
Hi, everybody!
Okay, so what I'm doing now is contour and highlight.
When I wasn't in prison,
I would do this with a MAC Pro Palette and a ♪19 fan brush.
But in here, I use three spices that you can find in any kitchen.
Yes, your face will smell like your abuela's pork.
But listen, you gotta make sacrifices if you wanna look DIY fly like me.
[chuckles]
First... contour.
[groaning]
[Angie groans]
Where's the cheese?
[retches and grunts]
Fuck.
Yeah, 'cause the cough syrup's red... [sniffs] and something was blue.
[grunts]
Hey!
[softly] Someone stole the fucking gun.
[Pidge] I'm from Hebei province in China, 56 years old, 108 pounds, and...
All right.
All right.
Okay.
I'm from Omaha, Nebraska, 46 years old, 130 pounds, ashy-blonde hair and I'm doing nine for media piracy.
Yo, we're all on the news, dumbass.
It's good 'cause people need to start taking us serious...
[Pidge] Oh...
[scattered chuckling]
Um, can I help you with something?
I'm going to rip his balls off.
[Zirconia] Oh, shit.
[banging on window]
Need to go to the bathroom!
I think he gotta go big bathroom.
[Maria] I think that you need to shut the fuck up.
[Stratman] A bucket is not a toilet.
I mean, I can't when there's other people around me.
I don't know.
[groans]
Is that that jazz club in Harlem?
What?
No, it's the sound frequency that makes your bowels vibrate and release automatically.
Hey, Stratman... [humming low note]
[grunts] [continues humming]
[Stratman coughs]
[cell phone ringing]
[Gloria] Aleida?
Oh, my God, Gloria?
You found a cell phone and you're calling me?
[chuckles]
How's everything out there?
You know, different nail salons.
After they seen my cheetah toes, everybody been fightin' over me.
You called it.
Listen, I gotta tell you something.
[sighs] Nothing.
[sighs] I feel like I'm, you know, losing my mind in here.
My grip on things.
You gotta do you, girl.
Keep your chin down, do your fucking time, and don't take care of nobody but yourself.
[chuckles]
And Daya, of course.
Don't you be no self-centered bitch when it comes to her.
She doin' all right?
[cell phone beeps]
[Pennsatucky grunts]
No, I like it just fine.
You're just not supposed to be doing anything that I don't say.
[Pennsatucky moans]
I wanna do to you what the vibrating phone did.
Seeing you get turned on, it was...
[Big Boo] You have got to fucking be kidding me, Doggett.
[Pennsatucky] Trust me, I've seen it done.
Get the fuck in there.
Let me give you a little preview of how this thing's gonna end.
See, any minute now, your boyfriend will be captured, taken to the bubble, where he will be forced to shit in a bucket.
And you'll be lucky if you're not tossed in there right behind him.
I don't know.
What could you possibly not know?
I can't control the chemicals.
I had to respect the chemicals.
No matter how much I wanted different, I had to respect the chemicals.
Because lye doesn't feel anything until it touches ephedrine.
You know what I mean?
[sighs]
Of course.
It's called masturbating.
Now, say goodbye and walk the fuck away, son.
Now the Estée Lauder makeup bag is our final offer and if you act now we'll throw in, uh, lightly used Invisalign braces.
Hey, my gap is awesome.
I just wanna fix my left pointy tooth 'cause it's a little twisty.
Territory is off-limits.
Then you ain't gettin' King.
And... we're taking our stock public.
[clamoring continues]
Or want you, depending how you wanna look at it.
All right, folks, we got a fine-lookin' piece of chattel up here.
A fine-looking piece of chattel.
I've got an Estée Lauder makeup bag high bidder, Estée Lauder high.
Does she know how to dress wounds?
Stifle it, meat!
I've got a phone charger money bidder, folks, phone charger money bidder.
And... and five ramen noodle packets!
Ten cans of tuna!
[Janae] Man, what we need this white lady for?
How are we supposed to get our demands met, and justice for P, if they think we a bunch of animals?
No, they're gonna think that we're animals no matter what.
Don't you know that?
A Debbie Gibson Electric Youth cassette tape.
[inmate] Potato chips!
Lisa Frank rainbow unicorn stickers.
I got an Anne Geddes babies calendar from 2007.
And sold, to the big black one, for the Anne Geddes baby calendar and the other stuff!
Unicorn stickers.
Oh, thank you, Cindy.
Oh, I guess it just shows you should stay friends with your exes, right?
Do you mind taking this collar off me right now?
Now get down!
[clicks tongue] Heel!
[Black Cindy chuckles]
We are so glad to have you here.
Is this your first time in Riverdale?
I mean, it's not like I've ever been to the South Bronx.
Although, my dad did once take me to Arthur Avenue to buy some crazy Italian espresso machine.
He's got this, like, whole coffee thing going on.
And the garden, obviously.
We harvested a whole bunch of stuff on Community Day and made this giant salad for the PTO.
Running hurts my boobs, but it burns so many calories.
Maybe I just need a better bra.
[news anchor] ...in the courts.
There's the question of how many correctional officers, staff members...
One peeing, one masturbating and one homeless.
Aleida, you seen this?
It's all over the news.
You have to keep in mind, a lot of these women are mentally ill, sent to prisons because so many of the state facilities have been shut down.
Maybe the riot hadn't started yet?
She was lying through her fucking teeth. [grunts] [voicemail message in Mandarin plays]
Fuck!
Where is she?
[news anchor] ...often affiliated with gangs and prone to violence.
They have no intention of rejoining polite society.
If and when we storm and there's hand-to-hand combat,
I didn't want any of them to have anything to grab on to.
Still, extreme. [chuckles]
Finally.
We can send these jokers back to Max and get the job done.
[indistinct chatter]
Cavalo, Reed, let's get the schematics and assign positions.
And when we get the cars out of here, we got a shit-ton of press and civilians to contain.
And what I was thinking is, we'd... we...
Voilà.
Your reading nook.
Oh.
Well, I thought we talked about the reading nook being a bit more about reading and less about... clutter.
I like having things around, Piper.
Why don't you go over there and sit on your dirty yoga mat and admire your... collections?
Do you not want me to be comfortable in our dirt home?
I'm simply asking you if these items spark joy.
According to The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, you should only have items in your home that... spark joy.
Larry got off target once, and I did not enjoy it.
Fuck!
What are all these people doing here?
Maybe they like sleeping alfresco, too.
Maybe they're playing follow the leader.
Shut up.
Caputo, you son of a bitch!
How do you sleep at night, knowing that that mother...
[Chang] Wrong toilet.
You knew what Piscatella was and you let that beast work here?
In a women's prison?
- [speaks Russian] - [in English] Red, please.
You have no idea how hot it is in here.
But at least you're not being boiled alive!
You don't think I've been trying to get rid of this guy, too?
But there was no charges pressed against him.
But where there is guilt, there's recourse.
There's always pins that can be pushed under fingernails.
How do you plan on getting to his fingers when you're in here, in a riot, and he's out there, with no charges against him?
Maybe, if you wish hard enough, he'll suddenly decide to sit down and write a confession called "I did it."
[softly] Yes... that's good.
I will write you a glowing commendation for your file.
You helped a warden in a time of crisis.
Red.
Red!
I call myself...
He can't breathe and he's humming Sound of Music songs.
[whispers] Hey, heads up!
[Blake and Stratman] ♪ Do, a deer, a female deer ♪
♪ Re, a drop of golden sun ♪
[Leanne sighs]
We don't got the gun.
My guinea pig got too big to pick up.
On three?
You're our hostage now, you squirmy little donut fucker.
Donut fucker!
Why are you guys down here?
Well, we were looking for the gun, but instead, we found a giant rabbit pig.
[Leanne and Angie chuckling]
[Leanne] Prison heroes, two days in a row.
Come on, help us take him to the bubble.
And show him how he's really done people wrong.
But then, no one would see our victory parade to the bubble.
Damn, I wish we had the gun for that.
Show 'em our colors don't run.
You know, I have a really good idea.
Why don't you two stay here and look for the gun,
[stutters] I just wanna see justice.
What do you mean, "which guy"?
The fucking guy you got on your channel right now talking bullshit about "the gang politics of riots."
Yeah, saying that all the inmates at Litchfield are dangerous?
That they don't want to be rehabilitated?
Everyone I know in there wants to be rehabilitated.
My daughter's still in there.
To confirm, you were in prison with Judy King?
Judy King was in prison with me.
Miss Diaz, can we send a town car for you?
You're willing to go on air with us, right?
Yeah.
[Black Cindy humming]
[Judy hissing]
It's like sawing through an elm.
What was that?
Uh, I said I love working on your feet, Bitch Goddess of Litch.
That's what I thought you said.
Just as soon as you work off your debts, hmm?
Though... you never did pay me for them Us Weekly photos, now did you?
- Oh, no. [groans] - [stutters] Mmm-mmm.
So, it's gonna be a while.
Oh, hell no!
We ain't even done my asshole hair trimming yet!
Look, I got to spread my cheeks and she gotta get up in there.
'Cause Judy need to talk to the press 'fore things swell up out there and he gonna massage her talking points.
Yes, he is.
I thought you meant that I could write a statement through my people.
Watson, are we serious?
I want justice for Poussey.
I want our demands met."
Now, do you want me to be off-book, or should I go out with this?
[Josh] Oh, you can have it with you.
And we all think that you should get back in uniform.
And so, what do I say when they ask me, "Why were you on the roof with idiots?"
Anything they ask, you say, "That's a great question.
But the bigger question is, what is going on in this prison system?"
Oh, and I personally think it might be helpful if you shared some sort of, um, relatable tribulations from your time in here.
Some painful experiences, uh, injustices...
Uh...
Um...
All right, so now, ladies, what would you like me to say?
[sighs] We get thrown into the SHU arbitrarily.
We're denied proper health care, dental.
I saw a girl with a tooth gone septic, and they still didn't take her to the doctor.
We get beat for no reason.
We get cavity searched for no reason.
We stuffed four in a bunk like we factory chickens.
We can't get clean half the time 'cause there ain't enough bathrooms.
We fed slop.
We're denied the chance to breastfeed our babies.
We're denied basic humanity.
And we get killed in the cafeteria for no reason.
You can't let this white woman speak for us.
She needs to take our stories out her mouth.
They want to hear from her.
And it would be smart of us if we put her out there.
They'll hear more of what we saying if it comes from her mouth.
Yeah, but she's never been a real prisoner a day in her life.
[Josh speaking indistinctly]
This is our fight, T.
Ours and Poussey's.
And you're gonna let some fuckin' white woman, like, karaoke our song.
That's fucked. [grunts]
I got this.
[young Janae] You get to keep the laptops?
No, we keep them during the year and then we return them so that they can update or replace them over the summer.
Oh, so what did you think of class?
I'm sorry we spent so much time on citations.
Erik thinks we need to know MLA, APA and Chicago Manual.
Yeah.
One of these is my brother's. [chuckles]
He's at Carnegie Mellon now.
Because I have something amazing to show you.

All these comments are about you, though.
[Maritza humming]
[sighs and scoffs]
There.
"Flaca looks like a beaner Cher."
Come on!
Who gives a shit what some Internet troll says?
[clicks tongue] "Hashtag, show your tits, Maritz."
Like, where do they come up with this?
[chuckles] Mmm.
- [Stratman] ♪ You can sing most anything ♪ - [banging on door]
Can you please let him out?
[Luschek] Hey, do you have any big erasers?
I have sensitive cochlea!
[panting] Oh, thank God.
I will flip this fucking thing over if you say one more word.
[Caputo] Delgado, is that you?
[Caputo] Gonzales?
Why the fuck would I do that?
My vomit is almost reaching the rim.
[Caputo] You know there will be severe consequences for this.
If you help me, I will help you.
That's what everyone that's ever fucked me over has said.
[Caputo] What about your kid, Ruiz?
Think about her.
If you help me, I can make sure your sentence doesn't get extended.
Hey, no kicking!
Piscatella already put five more years on my sentence for no fucking reason, all right?
My daughter won't even know my name by the time I get out anyway.
Ruiz, are you sure he put time on you?
'Course I'm sure!
[Caputo] You... you had a hearing already?
And with the speed paperwork moves around Litchfield,
I wouldn't be surprised if his recommendation is not even in your file yet.
Have you seen your file?
Piscatella, he's a... monster.
He should never have been working here in the first place, and that's my fault.
But you do not have to become the monster he's making you out to be.
I've seen you with the other inmates.
They look up to you.
[Stratman farts and groans]
[panting] [sighing]
Oh, fuck.
[indistinct chatter]
What?
Why there is an army of lemmings dressed like you, moving out here.
You're gaslighting me right now.
Do you know how I know that's emotional abuse?
I read it in an online quiz once, called "Are You Being Emotionally Abused?"
Okay, I may have shared some... some things in my history with a few inmates and it resonated.
That I killed Aydin.
You told them that you killed Aydin?
I didn't say Aydin specifically.
I just shared my...
I don't know, it just came out.
We were supposed to take that to the grave.
I went to Von Barlow and I begged her
Do you not want a real house?
It's not a real house if I can't carry my truth inside it, Piper.
And now you sound like a fucking E.E. Cummings poem.
I'm not sorry.
Yeah, it sucks that they turned it into some symbol of the resistance or whatever, but I am glad I said it out loud.
Now, I want to lay down in my tchotchke nook and I wanna relax until this whole thing blows over.
They heard what they wanted to.
They turned it into some kind of a symbol.
What you do and what you say affects people, Alex.
And if you do not curate your shit, you are not a collector.
I am going to the guest room.
Oh.
I'm from Fresno, California, 46 years old, Puerto Rican,
[inmates murmuring]
I'm from North Philly, 5'9", 285 pounds.
I got no identifying marks, and...
Who's Jodi Winkler?
[inmate] What?
She's like Rain Man.
Yo, you idiots got my file?
Who's Maria Ruiz?
[sighs]
I got a rose tattoo.
- [continues indistinctly] - [Ouija] Jessie...
- [Pidge grunts] - [inmate] Whoo!
"This prison has put me through unimaginable suffering, and I am not a victim of this riot.
I am an active participant.
Together, we stand united, protesting..."
"Protesting how unfair this system is."
"How unfair this system is."
"The waiter served a dinner roll to the woman that was well buttered."
Come on, guys.
Who can fix the misplaced modifier in that sentence?
Anyone?
Janae?
"The waiter served a dinner roll that was well buttered to the woman."
Everyone?
Do we see why?
[school bell ringing]
Okay, we'll pick up here tomorrow and then we'll move on to dangling modifiers.
I need your mom to sign this, so she knows you got a D.
It's hard for me to write grades like this on your work, Janae.
I know what you're capable of.
What do you mean?
I mean, we ain't quoting secondary sources using APA or MLA, and we ain't studying SAT words or growing salad, and we don't even have a library in this school 'cause it got made into a nursery for our fucking hood rat babies!
Janae.
Two zip codes from here they got laptops and art galleries.
They got so much culture, they ain't even knowin' they stealing' ours.
It's a load of shit.
You're right.
I wish you weren't, but it's true.
The Thurston students are privileged and advantaged, and sometimes you feel like you have to work twice as hard to get half as far, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.
But why even bother playing' a game that's rigged?
Courtney's going to a science camp this summer that cost more than my dad makes in three months.
How could I ever compete?
I'll see ya, Miss Fowler.
[Pennsatucky] I don't know, you guys.
I just think that we should have a little bit of fun with him, you know, like, torture him.
[Coates panting]
- [panting] - [grunts]
These guard uniforms are itchy.
Maybe we should change them after we dump him?
Mmm, yeah!
'Cause we'll go, like, full circle and remember where we put it.
[Leanne] Yeah.
[Pennsatucky] Freeze!
You put it on your belt!
[sighs] I didn't even know I was wearing a belt.
I must have put it on when I was fucked up.
[sighs]
Here, take it.
[grunts]
Oh, shit!
You shot my favorite finger,
- Ooh... fuck. [groans] - [Angie] Oh, my God.
[inmates gasping]
Judy King, are you a Muslim now?
[clamoring continues]
You want me to talk first or make an introduction?
[reporter] Did they hurt you at all?
Two days ago, our friend and fellow inmate, Poussey Washington, was murdered by a prison guard.
[camera shutters clicking]
Poussey Washington.
And I'm sayin' her name again because it can't ever be said enough.
Now, as you can see, Judy King ain't injured and she ain't a hostage.
And she has a statement that she'd like to make at this time.
[Judy] And good morning, my fellow Americans.
"This prison has put me through unimaginable suffering.
She is not gonna be making a statement.
Sorry.
She will not be speaking for us because Judy King can't speak for the inmates of this prison.
She was kept separate from us, held in a private room with better treatment and a seltzer-maker.
And moments after our friend, Poussey Washington, was murdered by a guard for doing nothing wrong,
Judy King was packing her bags to go home on early release.
Because she's rich and white and powerful.
[camera shutters clicking]
Now, our fight is not with Judy King.
Our fight is with a system that don't give a damn about poor people and brown people and poor brown people.
[sobbing] Our fight... is with the folks... who hold our demands in their hands.
Which you people need to read, by the way, and stop watching this fool shit comin' out of here online and get a hold of our demand list because those demands are fair and necessary, and show that we intend to keep this demonstration
peaceful and focused on change.
Now, Judy King is free to leave.
She's not a hostage and you can have her back.
Judy, get the hell out of here.
[reporters clamoring]
[sighs heavily]
You fuckin' freed my ho!
Who's gonna tend to my African sunflower?
You ever think about a career in the church?
That was something. [chuckles]
