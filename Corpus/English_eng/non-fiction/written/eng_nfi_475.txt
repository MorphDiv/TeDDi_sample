Black.
All important movies start with a black screen.
And music.
Edgy, scary music that would make a parent or studio executive nervous.
And logos.
Really long and dramatic logos.
Warner Bros.
Why not "Warner Brothers"?

DC.
The house that Batman built.
Yeah, what, Superman?
Come at me, bro.
I'm your Kryptonite.
Hmm.
Not sure what RatPac does, but that logo is macho.
I dig it.
Okay.
Get yourself ready for some reading.
"If you want to make the world a better place"
"take a look at yourself and make a change."
"Hooo."
No.

Batman is very wise.
I also have huge pecs and a nine-pack.
Yeah, I've got an extra ab.
Now, let's start the movie.
Gotham Tower, this is McGuffin Airlines, Flight 1138.
We are transporting 11 million sticks of dynamite, 17,000 pounds of C-4, about 150 cute little classic bomb-type bombs, and two best friends!
And request permission to fly over the most crime-ridden city in the world.
Over.
I'm just looking at all the guys' faces here in the control tower.
- I'm good.

- Do it!

- Thumbs up!

Gentlemen, seal breach in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!
What was that?
- One of us should check it out.

Scissors, paper, rock.
- Paper.

Ha!

I'm a loser at home and a loser at work.
Holy cow!
Captain Dale, is everything okay?
I am afraid Captain Dale had to bail.
I'm your new co-pilot.
And I always come to work with a smile!
- You should be terrified.

Because I will be taking over the city.
Mmm...
- What?

He always stops you.
No, he doesn't.
What about that time with the two boats?
This is better than the two boats.
- Mmm...

Tonight is my greatest plan yet.
And trust me, Batman's never gonna see it coming.
Like that time with the parade and the Prince music?
Hey, quiet!
- Good night, Steve.

Man, I really like that guy.
I sure hope nothing bad happens to him.
♪ Nothing bad ever happens to me ♪
What the...
Your city is under attack by Gotham's greatest criminal minds.
Including...
The Riddler.
Scarecrow.
Pizza delivery.
- Bane.

Two-Face!
We need that door open, baby!
Catwoman.
Meow, meow.

I'm jumping out of the way!
And let's not forget, Clayface.
Poison Ivy.
- Freeze!

You freeze!
Mr. Freeze!
Penguin, Crazy Quilt, Eraser.
Polka-Dot Man, Mime, Tarantula.
King Tut, Orca, Killer Moth,
March Harriet, Zodiac Master, Gentleman Ghost.
Clock King, Calendar Man, Kite-Man, Catman, Zebra-Man, and the Condiment King.
Okay, are you making some of those up?
Nope, they're all real.
Probably worth a Google.
- Hey, watch it!

What is it, O'Hara?
We just got a report!
All the Z-grade villains have broken into the energy plant!
What are we gonna do, sir?
The only thing we ever do.

Flip!
Commissioner, are you there?
The Bat-Signal, she's been egged!
It's Egghead, sir.
I'm well aware of his work.
Dear gosh.

You have thought of everything.
Yeah, I know!
And when I take over Gotham City...
Opening reactor core doors.
...Batman will grovel at the feet of his greatest enemy!
Me!

Joker, do you read me?
10-4, girl buddy.
We're ready for you, sugar plum.
Well, then, let's raise the roof!
Fire in the hole!
O'Hara, have you tried the Bat-Phone?
Yes, but all I'm getting is this hold music.
I love it.
- I want snipers trained on that building!

- I want water and air support, yesterday!

And I need SWAT here now!
Phone call for Commissioner Gordon.
Hello?

Hi, Jimmy!

Nobody calls you that.
Yes, people do call me that.
Okay, listen up.
Go, go, go!
At this very moment, an unnecessarily complicated bomb is being attached to the inside of the main energy core.
If the mayor isn't here in five minutes to negotiate the city's surrender, then I shall destroy Gotham City.
I did something!
Doctor, that sounds frightening and overly complicated.
Talk us through it.
Well, I don't wanna scare any small children who may be listening, but it's a little-known fact that Gotham City is built on a bunch of flimsy plates stuck together.
There's literally nothing beneath us, except an infinite abyss that smells like dirty underwear.
If Joker's bomb were to go off, these plates would break apart, plunging every Gotham citizen into the eternal abyss forever.
And you wouldn't want that, now would you?
Now get me the mayor!

Madam Mayor, I cannot ask you to do this!
- Jim, did you find Batman?

Then we have no choice.
The Joker has the upper hand.

Oh, no.
I'm sorry!
Flying the mayor package in right now.
SWAT team, get your stun guns ready!
- Non-lethal.

Lowering mayor package through hole.
Madam Mayor!
Thanks for dropping by.
I've only got one thing to say to you, Joker.
Well, you better make it fast.
Do you like to gamble?
Oh, I certainly do.
Do you ever play roulette?
On occasion.
Well, let me give you a word of advice.
I'm all ears.
When playing roulette...
Yes?
...always bet on black.
Batman?
What are you doing?

Are you nuts?
You wanna get nuts?

Let's get nuts!

Looks like your plan failed.
Well, it's only a matter of time before I take over Gotham City.
When has that ever happened?

Calculating.

You know why?
Because I'm always one step ahead of you.
And I always get away!
Not this time.
'Cause this time...
I got you.
Oh, yeah?
Well, there's only one problem.
Who's gonna defuse the bomb?
It's gotta be one or the other, Batman.
Save the city, or catch your greatest enemy.
You can't do both.
I'm sorry, what did you just say?
You can't do both, I said.
No, I mean the other thing.
Save the city, or catch your greatest enemy.
You think you're my greatest enemy?
Yes!

No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

Yes, you are!

- Bane.

- Superman.

Then I'd say that I don't currently have a bad guy.
I am fighting a few different people.
What?
I like to fight around.
Okay, look, I'm fine with you fighting other people if you wanna do that, but what we have is special.
So, when people ask you...
"Who's your number one bad guy?" you say...
Superman.
Are you seriously saying that there is nothing, nothing special about our relationship?
Whoa.
Let me tell you something, J-bird.
- Batman doesn't do 'ships.

As in "relationships."
There is no "us."
Batman and Joker are not a thing.
I don't need you.
I don't need anyone.
You mean nothing to me.
No one does.
Hurray!

You did it!
You're welcome.
- Thank you, Batman.

Batman, we love you!
Thank you!

- Grazie, Batman!

- You're the best, Batman!

- Thanks, Batman!

- Batman, you're the greatest!

- Thanks for saving the city!

Batman, I love you more than my kids!
So do I, guy!
You're our hero, Batman!
I love my life.
Computer.
Go ahead.
- Are we near the orphanage?

Great.

That sounds like the Batmobile.
No way!
Hey, orphans!

It's Batman!
Hey, kids.

- I do, I do, I do!

- Kaboom!

- Kaboom!

- Kaboom!

And the rest of you get Bat Bucks.
Kaboom!
Remember, kids, if you want to be like Batman, take care of your abs.

Batman!

Thanks, Batman.

Whoo!
What is the password?
Iron Man sucks.
Thank you.
It must be great to be Batman.
I can only imagine he is going home right now to party the night away, surrounded by scores of friends and lady tennis players.
Hey, Computer.
I'm home.
Welcome home, sir.
Initializing Batcave operating system.
Hey, 'Puter.
What's up, Batman?
Put this bomb in the museum.
Certainly, sir.
- Thank you.

Anything exciting happen when I was gone?
You have four pieces of mail.
Great, what'd I get?
You have this week's Pennysaver, two bills, and a coupon for Bed Bath and Beyond.
It expires in two weeks.
But I've heard that some stores will honor them past the expiry date.
Copy that.
Also, Alfred is on the 17th floor, grouting tiles in the second bathroom of the fifth master bedroom.
Do you want me to tell Alfred you're home?
No, that's cool, Computer.

I should probably have some dinner.
Alfred left your lobster thermidor in the fridge.
Oh, that's my favorite.
I can't wait.
Oh, not 20 minutes.

Oh, wait.
There, which one is, uh...
Okay.
You complete me.
Shut up.

Love it!
Hey, Mom.
Hey, Dad.
I, uh...
I saved the city again today.
I wish you could have seen me.
I think you would have been really proud.
There you are!
Oh!

I have incredible reflexes.
No, it's all my fault, sir.
I should have known better than to sneak up on you like that.
Sorry, I was just lost in thought, and as you know, when I'm in there, I'm in deep.
Were you looking at the old family pictures again?
At the what?

Oh, yes!

Look at that!

Yeah.

I see.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I'm a little concerned.
I've seen you go through similar phases in 2016 and 2012 and 2008 and 2005 and 1997 and 1995 and 1992 and 1989 and that weird one in 1966.
Do you want to talk about how you're feeling right now?
I don't talk about feelings, Alfred.
I don't have any, I've never seen one.
I'm a night-stalking, crime-fighting vigilante, and a heavy metal rapping machine.
I don't feel anything emotionally, except for rage.
24/7, 365, at a million percent.
And if you think that there's something behind that, then you're crazy.
Good night, Alfred.
Sir, it's morning.
Master Bruce, you live on an island, figuratively and literally.
Yeah.

You can't spend the rest of your life alone, dressed in black, listening to angry music, and staying up all night.
Yes, I can, 'cause I'm Batman.
But don't you think it's time you finally faced your greatest fear?
- Snakes?

- Clowns?

Snake clowns?
Bruce, listen.
Your greatest fear is being a part of a family again.
Nope.

- Sir?

One, two...

I'm afraid that's not possible, sir.
It is possible.

You're scheduled to go to Jim Gordon's retirement party.
What?

- You're going to have a great time!

You might meet some new people!
No, no, no!
You could even make some new friends.
No, no, no, no.

No!
And before you go, we can do your favorite thing.
Tuxedo dress-up party.
Sir, aren't you forgetting something?
- Nope.

My what, now?
Your armored face disguise?
Fine.
- Happy now?

Good.

Tonight, on Metropolis in Focus, we have our favorite star, Superman!
What up, Gotham!
Superman, tell me.

Yeah, look, Pippa, it's...

Zod and I, we've had some pretty epic battles over the years.
I don't believe I would be Superman without fighting Zod.
See?

Check it out, guys.

And how am I supposed to get Batman's respect when I'm working with these human farts?
Boo-boo, look at me.
You're too good for Batman.

Yeah, Pippa.

He's Zod.

No, he needed to go someplace where he could never harm Metropolis ever again.
The Phantom Zone.
Ah, yes, the notorious space jail that houses the greatest super-villains of all time.
They've got, like, the sickest baddies up there.
They got, like, this guy.
- And her.

- To say nothing about him.

And these guys.
Exterminate!
I'm starting to get an idea, monkey face.
Bruce, over here!
Okay, shutterbugs.

I'm gonna give you three poses.

Kissy face.
Oops, I did it again.
And the Bad Boys.

I'm out of here, guys.

- Congresswoman.

- Senator, looking great.

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
Bruce, any advice for the new commissioner?
Long as he knows how to push the button for the Bat-Signal, he'll be fine.
Bruce, I don't know how you did it.
You can't prove it, you didn't do it.
Mr. Wayne, so great to see you!

Mr. Prime Minister.
Did you have some work done?
No way!
Bruce Wayne!
He's the greatest orphan of all time.
♪ Shamon, Shamon ♪
- Nice to see you, Mr. Ambassador.

- You want a picture?

Here we go.

Boom.

Whoa!

Call me Bruce, champ.
I'm just so jazzed to meet you, sir.
I'm sorry, did you say "jazzed"?
Yes!

- Well, children can be cruel.

- Great to see you, Bruce.

- So, I had a question for you, sir.

Do you have any advice on how to get adopted?
- Oh, yeah.

- Mr. Wayne, can I get an autograph?

Um, all right, for example, is teeth whitener a good idea?
- Yes.

- Really?

- Looking good, Bruce.

How about eyeliner or a foreign language?
- Try both.

Look, it's the new commissioner!
- Where?

Here she is, everyone!
- Oh, my darling!

Mr. Wayne?
Should I get experimental surgery to make my eyes larger and more vulnerable-looking?
Uh, do that.
Uh, Mr. Wayne?
Are you currently in the market to adopt a child?
- Yeah.

- Oh, yeah.

Are you looking for more of a base model orphan
- or one that has more upgraded features?

Like cooking or driftwood art?
- Gymnastic abilities?

Close-up street magic à la David Blaine?
- All of it sounds great.

Because all of it sounds like me.
Mr. Wayne, do you think you'd be interested in adopting me as your future orphan son?
Definitely.
Oh, this is great!
Because all I want is to get adopted, so I can finally stop being alone.
We've gathered here tonight to mark the retirement of Jim Gordon.
Goodbye.
And we wish him well on his South African jungle safari!
Thank you.
Now, to introduce you to his exciting new replacement.
Everyone, meet your new commissioner!
Meet Barbara Gordon!
- The new commissioner of Gotham City!

She was top of her class at Harvard for Police.
She cleaned up the streets of Gotham's nearby sister city Blüdhaven using statistics and compassion.
And now she's bringing her new ideas and her nunchucks to Gotham City.
Congratulations, darling.
- Thanks, Dad.

Thank you!

Hurray!
Ms. Gordon, over here!
- Big smile!

Thank you for the oversized key to Arkham Asylum.
And, uh, what's this?
Thank you for the switch to the Bat-Signal.
Nice.
Dad, you've always done a great job protecting Gotham City.
Flip!

Thank you.

Whoo!

Who I wish was here right now.
Oh, I'm sure he's listening.
I'd like to ask all of you a question.
Are you fed up with crime?
- Uh-huh.

Great.

I've got a four-point pilot program that I'd love to share with you.
I wanna hear all four points.
- It's called...

It takes a village...
Best opening to a title ever.
Not a Batman.
- Waiter.

- Can I?

- Thank you.

Thanks so much.
- What?

Batman's been on the job for a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very long time.
He has aged phenomenally.
However, despite all the great work Batman has done for us,
Gotham City is still the most crime-ridden city in the world.
- She's got a great point.

Historically speaking, that is accurate.
- He hasn't captured Riddler.

He hasn't captured Bane.
- Huh!

Or Two-Face, or any of Gotham's other villains!
He's not good at his job.
Including the Joker!
She's making a lot of sense.
Excuse me.

We love you, Barbara!
- Yes.

Billionaire, bon vivant, gallivanter, playboy,
Gotham's most eligible bachelor, like, 90 years in a row.
- That's me right there.

You bet you do.

I'm glad you asked, Mr. Wayne.
I'm not a Batman hater.
But we don't need an unsupervised adult man karate-chopping poor people in a Halloween costume.
We need to take what's good about Batman and marry it to actual laws and proper ethics and accountability.
I hate everything you just said.
Because my dream is for the police force to team up with Batman.
Waiter.
Wouldn't that be better?
And I know that, together, the world's greatest detective and Gotham's finest could clean up these crime-ridden streets.
Forever.
Everybody, get down!
Grand entrance!
Everyone!

Run!
Team Bane, block the exits.
Going somewhere?
Clayface, Freeze, bring me the new Commissioner Gordon.
- We're on it.

And, Harley, you know what to do.
I sure do.
It's time for Operation "Take Out the Laundry."
Butler One, this is Bat One.

- Go ahead, Bat One.

Only if you say the magic word.
- Now!

- You're fired.

- Hey, 'Puter.

Initialize masterbuild music.
Right away.
Collateral damage assessment suggests the Scuttler, sir.
Good plan.
Madam Mayor, stay close to me.
Head for the south exit.
Now, ma'am.
Go!

Honey, let Batman take care of it.
Dad, I got this.
Scuttler online.
Chief O'Hara, we're coming in hot!
I'm almost there.
Chief, get the mayor to safety.
Computer, I've got the Joker in my sights.
Team, I got the Joker in my sights.
Joker!
Joker.
Uh, excuse me?

Push the Bat-Signal?

I've got a surprise for you guys.
And it's gonna make you smile.
Uh-oh!

Everybody, get down.
- I...

...surrender.
What?
Uh, what did you just say?
I said, "I surrender."
Joker, what are you doing?
I'm sorry, my Bat-ears must be malfunctioning because it sounds...
I surrender!
Okay, you know what?

You run, and I catch you.
Not anymore, Batman.
You were right.

So, there's no point in me trying to fight you anymore.
Therefore, I will be surrendering myself to our strong-willed and forward-thinking new commissioner.
Blink, blink, blink.

That's really suspicious.
Yeah, it is.

I just wanna go to Arkham and pay for all of my crimes.
Blink, blink, blink.

Are you actually saying "blink"?
No!

Joker!

Okay, Babs.

Not so fast, Batman.

I'm off the market.
What are you talking about?
I'm off the menu.
You won't get to fight any of this anymore.
Man, am I sorry I asked.
Anyway, have fun in jail and...
Batman, what are you doing?
Punching Bane.
That was unnecessary.
Oh, no, you can't fight Bane anymore either.
Really?
Yeah.

Or Catwoman.

Why not?
Because we're all surrendering.

We are?
Yes!
Riddle me this.

It's the end of crime!
All right!
- That was amazing!

- You did it!

Sorry, not you.

- Well, it was a team effort.

Commissioner, how do you feel?
Amazing!

Okay.
- Question for Batman.

What are you gonna do with the rest of your life?
What do you mean, the rest of my life?
We don't need a vigilante crime fighter now that there's no more crime.
Uh, yes, you do.
You can spend some quality time with your family.
My...
Okay, Batman.

All right, listen up.
All of you have the right to remain silent.
Let's roll out!
Toodle-oo, Batman!
- Bye, Batman.

Bye, Batman.
Bye, Batman!
Today is a victory for the citizens of Gotham City!
No more crime!

No more crime!

No more crime!

Is everything okay, sir?
You've barely touched your lobster thermidor.
I don't have time to eat lobster thermidor right now!
Warrior two.
Pigeon pose.

Tree pose.
Hey, Batman!
Barbara!
What are you doing?
Nothing.

No, I mean, what are you doing here?
Surveillance.

Batman, we both know the Joker's up to something.
Well, then we can't just let him run around loose in a prison.
He's not loose.
He has to go someplace outside the law.
- Outside the law?

Somewhere like, uh...
Hi, there.

Here to take that bad stuff off your hands.
Wait, that's it!

The Phantom Zone?

That is super illegal and way outside our jurisdiction.
So, why don't you and I work together inside the law, to figure out what he's up to?
Batman works alone.

Batman, there are no more vigilantes allowed in Gotham City.
Okay.

Then I have to go into double-secret super vigilante mode.
You said that out loud.
I know that she said I said that out loud, but there's no way I did.
She has no idea what's going on in my super-mind.
Super-mind?
Smoke bomb!
Computer, how do I put the Joker in the Phantom Zone?
Quickest route, no freeways.
'Puter, do you hear me?
Hello, Master Bruce.
Alfred, there's something wrong with the Batcomputer.

'Puter.

'Puter.

There's nothing wrong with it, sir.
I have just taken away your computer privileges.
The parental lock?

Oh, I can.

Setting Limits for Your Out-of-Control Child.
You know what?

You mean, "Alfred da Butt-ler," with two T's?
Sir, it's time for you to stop this unhealthy behavior.
No, it's not.
You need to take responsibility for your life.
Not right now, I don't.
And it starts by raising your son.
I'm sorry.
I literally have no idea what you're talking about.
The young orphan you adopted at the gala.

Wow!

He's been living here for the past week.
Hello, table!

And I must say, I've grown rather fond of the young lad.
Hello, secret camera.
You should get to know him.
♪ We are family ♪
- You and he have a lot in common.

Hello, family photos.
He lost his parents at a very young age.
I've always wanted one of those.
Doesn't he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine?
Alfred, you've been watching way too many Lifetime movies and drinking chardonnay.
- It's Pinot grigio, sir.

Listen, you don't have a family.
You're satisfied serving me.
So what do you know about having a surrogate son?
Now, I'm gonna go fight crime while you put that kid on the next jet to the orphanage.

As you wish, sir.
Whoops-a-daisy.
Wait, what are you doing?
Dusting.
You can't let him into the Batcave!
I'm not.

What?
It's the Batcave!
Oh, my gosh.

Oh, my gosh.

Oh, my gosh.

Batman!

You're darn right, "Whoa."
Wait, does Batman live in Bruce Wayne's basement?
No.

- We can have sleepovers every night!

- Wow!

Over there, it's the Bat-Space shuttle.
Please, keep your hands off that.
- Look, it's the Bat-Zeppelin!

- It's the Bat-Train!

- It's the Bat-Kayak.

- It's the Bat-Dune buggy.

It's the Bat shark repellent?
Uh, actually, you can touch that.

Whoa!

Please, stand over there.
And don't touch, look at, or do anything for the remaining moments you have in my presence.
Okay, cool.
- Computer.

How do I put the Joker in the Phantom Zone?
Joker can only be put in the Phantom Zone using the Phantom Zone Projector.
Current location,
Superman's Fortress of Solitude inside the Atomic Cauldron.
However, only a person that isn't shredded, ripped, or extremely swoll can enter the cauldron.
Ugh, I'm way too buff.
You also have beautiful abs, sir.
That's my cross to bear.
Additionally, once inside the cauldron, multiple Kryptonian defense systems engage, including the Acid Moat, Ring of Napalm, and the Jaws of Death.
Chance of total mission failure is 110%.
Those are not great odds.
Wait a minute.
- Hey, kid.

- You're super nimble, right?

- And small?

- And quiet?

And 110% expendable?
I don't know what that means, but okay.
Great.

We are gonna steal the Phantom Zone Projector from Superman.
- Steal?

We have to right a wrong.
And, sometimes, in order to right a wrong, you have to do a wrong-right.
Gandhi said that.
Are we sure Gandhi said that?
- I'm paraphrasing.

Preparing Fortress of Solitude infiltration gear.
Wow!

Do I get a costume for the mission, too?
I got a feeling that you'll just look like a kid on Halloween.
Don't you think?
Don't touch that.
Whoo-hoo!
- El Mariachi.

- That one is culturally insensitive.

- That one!

- This one?

- No.

- This one.

- This one.

- Excali-Bat.

- Silent but Deadly.

Bat-ryshnikov.
How do we feel about this one?
Dress-up parties are for grown-ups only.
Wait.

That one was for the assignment called The Jamaican Caper.
The locals called me Reggae Man.
I love it!
Ah!

My only trouble is, these pants are just a little tight.
I don't know if I could throw a kick or jump in them.
I got an idea.

Now I'm free, now I'm moving.
Come on, Batman.

I can only look you in the eyes right now.
- Sir, what are you doing?

Why is Master Dick dressed like that?
How dare you tell me how to parent my kid I just met?
To the Batmobile!
Hot-diggity-dog!
Vehicle rotisserie engaged.
Retrieving the Speedwagon.
Atomic batteries to power.
Turbines to speed.
Hey, kid.

- Oh, shoot!

I probably shouldn't leave until I get the thumbs up from my new old man, Bruce Wayne.
Uh, yeah.

Bruno and I decided to share custody of you.
So I get a say and you're mission approved.
No way!

Yeah.
Whoo-hoo!
A month ago, I had no dads.
Then I had one dad.

- And one of them is Batman!

It's raining dads!
So, are you ready to follow Batman and maybe learn a few life lessons along the way?
I sure am, Dad Two!
But first, where's the seatbelt?
The first lesson is, life doesn't give you seatbelts!
- Let's go!

Yes!
Faster, Dad!

- Whoo!

- Whoo!

Yes, yes, yes!
Oh!

Get back up in that seat.

Hey, listen.

I'll make sure that Alfred puts seatbelts on there, okay?
But for the time being, I'm just gonna put my arm right here.
And we're just gonna gently ease out of here.
And here we go.
Okay.

Superman has zero friends, and he spends most of his time basking in sweet, sweet isolation, here at his alone palace.
So, I'll keep him busy while you sneak into that vent and get the Projector.

Copy that!

Whoa, whoa.

See this counter?

And no one else has ever had any good ideas.

Your super power is excellent listening and execution of my ideas.
- Let's try it out.

Drop to the ground.

Do a front flip.

Plié.

A squared plus B squared equals C squared.
Physicalize it!
A squared plus B squared equals C squared.
- How'd I do, Dad?

Yes!
And don't call me "Dad." Now, begin mission.
Yes, Papa.
"Papa" falls into the "Dad" category.
'Sup, Supes?
Wow.

And he's at my house.
Right now.
What are you doing here?
Don't worry about it, dawg.

Uh, no, I would crush you.
Okay.

Hey, listen.

And I figured that you could probably use the...
Wait a minute.
Are you...

- without me?

No!

No!

That's crazy, man.
Totally!

Sometimes I don't get Superman's emails for years.
Great point, G.L. Great point.
All right.

Enjoy the party, bro.
Hit it, DJ Wonder Dog.
♪ I'm Superman at the super party ♪
♪ I'm Superman at the super party ♪
♪ Hey-hey ♪
Hey, Batman.

Sure.

Right there is perfect.
- Here's the camera.

Okay, party people, get together.
Yeah.

Super Friends!
Let me see it!

Classic!

Yeah, everyone.
Thanks, Batman.
Yeah, no problem.

This party is the bomb!
Look at me!

'Puter, call kid.
Bat-Dad?
How's it going?
'Cause everything is going great down here.
I can see the target.
But there's some kind of laser energy thing that I can't get through.
Okay.

But I'm gonna have to make up an excuse to leave this party without anyone noticing.
Bye.
Kid, tell me when it's off, all right?
- Now?

- Now?

- Now?

- Now?

- My son...

These irreplaceable crystals contain all my knowledge, which I now pass on to...
Darn it.

O.M. gosh!

Okay.
Now you gotta make your way to the Atomic Cauldron and get that Phantom Zone Projector.
- Do exactly as I say.

Okay.

Do a front flip.

Run, run, run.

That's excellent listening.
Shimmy.
Strafe-left.

Avoid.
Hey, I was thinking.

Mine can be Robin.
- I'm sorry, say that again?

As in the small, Midwestern frail bird?
Yeah, and I already have a catch phrase.

- Hard pass.

♪ Fly, Robin, fly ♪
Harder pass.

Okay, kid.

Yay!
Grab those 2x6's, pull out the axle studs, disconnect the 6x10 plates.
Like this?
Whoa!

Now, let's ride.
Toes to the nose.
Now you're gleaming the cube.
- Yeah!

Freestyle a little bit.

It's like looking in a Bat-mirror.
Okay.

- I've got the Projector, Dad.

Now do everything we just did backwards.
Oh.
Oh!

Yeah!

You okay, Batman?

Yeah, I'm fine.

For a brief moment
I could have sworn I felt something.
That feeling is pride, sir.
You're right.
I am super proud.
Of myself.
For being such a good teacher, obviously.
Yeah, you're a great teacher.
I am?
Yeah!

Wait, what did you call me?
I called you Padre.
It's Spanish for "Dad." Sorry.
Well, isn't it also a cool Spanish way to say "buddy"?
Yeah, I could've been saying it that way.
Then I'll allow it.
Oh, you're such a great padre!
What are you doing?
I'm trying to give you a big old hug.
Thought you were attacking me.
Hey, you up for another top secret superhero mission to defeat the Joker?
Oh, I am down to stop that clown.
But I don't wanna make my other dad, Bruce Wayne, angry.
Do you think we'll be done before my bedtime?
Bedtime?
Batman's life lesson number two.
Vigilantes don't have bedtimes.
Yes!
So, what's the vigilante policy on cookies?
Unlimited!
All right, kid.

So, lesson number three.
When going stealth, you gotta hide every part of you, physically and emotionally.
- Got it?

Already failed.
Now, what I need you to do is use the naturally dark areas of your costume, and integrate into the dark parts of this environment.
Okay.
- Can you see me?

- How about now?

- What about now?

Yes.

- Batman?

Batman?

Hey, there.

- Who's this?

- Is that your son?

Is that my son...

It's weirder if it's not your son.
Right.

I'm not in a relationship or anything.
I could have a kid.
I mean, if I met the right lady, and if she was just standing right in front of me, and we looked at each other and thought, "Hey, let's do this."
"Let's be together."
- Batman?

I hope you're back because you've decided to work together on the Joker case.
Uh...
Yeah.

Great.
Ooh.

- So, before we question the Joker...

...I'm gonna need you to hand over all your weapons.
I mean, I don't know if I have anything...
Oh!
I just got a couple here.

- Is that it?

Oh.

What about the utility belt?

Under your cowl?
And your shoes.
There we go.
Uh...

Sorry.

Oops.
- Batman?

Why is your "not son"
trying to smuggle the Phantom Zone Projector into Arkham?
What?

Batman, give me the Phantom Zone Projector.
- No.

Give me the Phantom Zone Projector!

No, no, no!

I studied Brazilian jiu-jitsu at Harvard for Police.
Oh, yeah?

Dr. Batman.
Guards!

Freeze, Batman!
Hey, kid.

- Go ahead and take a couple of them out.

- Hey, Frank.

- Barney!

Code Red!
I need total security lockdown, now!
Om!
'Sup, Joker?
Namaste, Batman.
- Namaste.

Ooh.

Cut the baloney.

On it!

Huh.

I must be your greatest enemy after all.
Right, Batman?
- I see what you're trying to do.

You're trying to entrap me into a relationship.
- Really?

Oh, yes, it is.
Because I'm inside your head.
- No, you're not!

I knew you'd say that.
- No, you didn't!

And I knew you'd say that!
See?

- It's, "you and I!"

- Argh!

You're not my greatest enemy, Joker.
Okay, then send me to the Phantom Zone.
Fine, I will.
And prove I'm your greatest enemy.
Batman, don't do this.
As long as you're in the Phantom Zone, I'll be saving Gotham City, and that's all that matters to me.
Goodbye, Joker.
Oh, Batman, thank you!
Yes!

Batman, what are you doing?
I'm Batman-ing.
♪ I'm Batman, I'm awesome ♪
♪ I got a nine-pack ♪
Stop it!
Batman, I can't believe you did this.
Hi, police lady.
And even worse, you've made this kid into an accessory to your crime.
Sorry, kid.
That's okay, ma'am.
As long as I'm doing a dime in the big house with my old man, everything's gonna be A-okay.
Officers, take this Projector to the evidence room.
- You got it.

I'm good the way I am.
B Go, why has nobody fist bumped me yet?
You know, when I was a kid,
I wanted to be you, Batman.
I wanted to be as strong and as fast and as smart as Batman.
But you're not who I thought you were.
Uh...

You can't be a hero if you only care about yourself.
Barbara, I...
I think you're underestimating the importance of the Joker being in the Phantom Zone.
Really, it's kind of a stroke of genius.

Hey, where are you going?
I just put Joker in the one place he can't do anyone any harm.
Yeah.
But what if you just gave Joker exactly what he wanted?
Oh!
Whoa!
Look at this place!

- Hi!

Sorry.

How about a warning next time?
You're so right, and I am so wrong.
Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy.
Yeah, bad guy.
- My name is Phyllis.

Now hold still while I scan you.
Scanning for badness.
Trying to assess whether you are bad.
Ugh!

Oh, yeah.

But with vulnerabilities.
Who, me?

So, where do you keep all the other bad people in this place?
They're standing right behind you.
Whoa!
Hi there, guys.
Lovely to meet you all.

Oh, fist bump?

It doesn't matter.

Take a look at the new guy.
Guess they'll just let anybody in here.
Oh, no, no, no.

They just showed a video montage...
- Boring!

- You're boring.

Let's eat this guy.
Stop with the violence for just a second!
What if I told you I could get you outta here?
I'm sorry, what'd you just say?
That's right.

I'm listening.
Count me interested.
Look, everyone here knows what it's like to be hurt by a hero, don't they?
We've all been taken for granted, right?
- Yeah, bro.

Well, that's why I came to this space prison.
To recruit the universe's greatest...
- We'll do it!

You were going to say something about recruiting the universe's greatest villains to conquer a superhero.
- Am I right?

- Well, we're in!

Really?

Still boring!
Yeah.

You want us to humiliate him?
I certainly do.

You want us to make him grovel at your feet?
I would like to see that very much!
You want us to smite him?
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You want us to make the rivers of Gotham City run red with his blood?
Oh, that's...
Oh, no blood?

Yes!

- Done.

- I can't wait to crush buildings.

Over here.

Oh, leave that to me.
Don't wanna jinx us, but I'll be a lot happier when this Phantom Zone Projector is locked up tight.
Going up, ma'am?
No.

Look out!

I guess you're right.

Here comes the...
Phantom Zone!
Huh?
I'm gonna go start looting.
Hello, Gotham City!
The Clown Prince of Crime is back!
Commissioner Gordon, you gotta take a look at this.
What's that?
A monkey and dog are friends.
Not that.

And I've come to finally take over the city.
But in order to do that,
I need to break my friends out of a giant, scary prison.
- Hey, guys, he means us!

And I ain't talking about those rogue losers dressed in cosplay!
- Oh!

I'm talking about my new peeps!
And they're just like me.
The greatest villains you'll ever see.
You wanna meet them?
- No.

He's evil, he's magic, and it's about to get tragic.
It's Voldemort.
Magic!
You are a fish.
You are a frog.
You are a fish frog.
He's a 9,000-year-old incarnation of evil, with an eye forjewelry.
Give it up for Sauron!
Good afternoon, Gotham City.
He likes long, violent walks on historic buildings.
It's King Kong!
Come at me, Gotham!
Commissioner Gordon, these monsters, they're too powerful.
Can you contain them to downtown?
That's gonna be impossible.
Half the police force are fish!
Sergeant Jackson!

And rounding out the evil all-stars,
Wicked Witch!
Medusa.
And British robots!
Exterminate!
Ask your nerd friends.
Hello?

What a crew, huh?

Who's the greatest villain of them all now, Batman?
Still not you.
Actually, this does look pretty terrifying, Bat-Dad.
Whee!
Nice destruction all around.
Watch your step!
Good work, guys!
Now, all that's left for me is to rub it in Batman's bat face.
Hey, Sauron, doesn't your flaming eye have a unique ability to peer through time and space?
- Uh-huh.

Where's homeboy's man cave?
Hmm.

Scary noise.
It's beneath Wayne Manor!
Whoa!

Hold on a sec.
Are you trying to tell me that Bruce Wayne is Batman 's roommate?
Uh...

Evil army, this way to the Batcave!
Good grief!
Hey, Batman!
Joker's home.
I'm rubbing my butt all over your stuff.
We're going to have to rename this the Butt-mobile.
Hey, evil army.
I need Batman brought here.
Now go get him!
Joker out!
Uh...
Padre?
Yeah?
Do you ever get scared?
No.
Yeah, that's what I figured, 'cause you're Batman.
Hey, kid.

Who?
Bruce Wayne.
- Really?

Bruno told me once that sometimes the only way to get out of a down moment is to start boxing.
And by "boxing," he meant beatboxing.
Oh!
♪ Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na... ♪
♪ Feel it, uh-huh ♪
♪ Dick Grayson on the mic, go ♪
Oh.

Oh, my gosh.

Okay.

♪ Bat, bat, bat, can I get a bat?

♪ Can I get a bat?

The Bat-Fax!
Ha!

Excuse me.
Can you get the commissioner and show her this?
- Batman.

I sent the Bat-Fax.
I hate to say this, but you're right.
The city needs you.
Yes!

I'm only going to let you out on one condition.
- Name it.

Fine.

SEAL Team Six?

No.

Oh, I wanna help, too!
- And I shall join as well.

Alfred Pennyworth at your service, ma'am.
- How did you...

Sir, those creatures out there are unlike anything we've ever seen.
Speak for yourself.

I haven't told you everything.
And you'll never be able to defeat them alone.
And it'll be more fun if we all do it together!
What's the worst thing that could happen?
What are you so afraid of?
The thing I'm most afraid of?
I gotta be honest with you.

Yeah, that's not a thing.
Well then, nothing.
- I'm not afraid of anything.

Prove it.
- Oh, I will.

Do you know what the B-A-T in Batman stands for?
- Not really.

Best At Teamwork Man is my full name.
Yay!

This is not a family trip.
I can wear my costume, too.
Well, luckily for us, you left your costume back at the...
- Rip!

Nope.

- Rip!

I miss the '60s.
Hey, can Scarecrow help?
- Yeah!

Permit us to lend you assistance.
Yeah.

What am I gonna do?
Get a bunch of criminals together to fight the criminals?
That's a stupid idea.
Okay, guys.

Joker's taken the Projector
- to Wayne Manor.

Right.

- We need that Projector.

Or there's no way
- to blast these monsters...

- ...back to the Phantom Zone.

Batman, I really don't need you to finish my...
- Sand castles.

- Sister's homework.

- Succulent something.

Um...

Batman is in Arkham Asylum.
Get him!
Okay, everyone, grab on to me.
Whoa!
We've gotta take cover!
Whoa!
- Joker has eyes on us.

No!

I think that thing can see our every move!
Shaka-laka-Iako.
We've got to destroy it, or we'll never make it to Wayne Manor.
Uh...

I really think you should see this.
Building survey!
This building's not up to code!
Gotcha.
Is that real lava?
I'm okay.
All right, yeah.

- Everyone, start throwing me bricks.

- I need a 4x6.

- I need an elbow.

Ow!
Whoo!
Yes!

- Batman?

Why did you build this thing with only one seat?
'Cause last I checked, I only had one butt.

What have you done to Wayne Manor?
Hey, Batman, guess what!
I found out one of your secrets.
- Uh-oh.

It looks like a bunch of relationship comedies.
- What's that one?

Must love crying.
- Marley  Me.

Oh!

We have Serendipity?

For a loner, Batman, you sure like movies about relationships!
Oh!

All your wonderful toys.
Accio lightning storm!
Uh...

Gremlins, dismantle that plane now!
Ugly monsters on our three.
- Uh...

Kind of got my hands full.
I've got good tone.

- Uh...

- Are we nearly at Wayne Manor?

Uh...

I thought I told you to go back at the prison.
- I tried, but Bane was in there.

He had sort of a "get out of this bathroom now" vibe.
I knew I shouldn't have given you that water.
Can you hold it in like a big boy?
Engine one down.
Not a big deal.

- Engine two down.

We've lost engine three.
Oh.

Engine four!
That I do need to fix.
Good news.

You three wait here while I go fix the engine.
Don't worry, Batman.

All good, Babs.

Done.
Autopilot?

Exactly.

Thanks, rope.
All right, let's see.

Jet engine brake in here and...
Get out of here.

Come on, Master Dick.

I'm with you, Grandpa!
Get off my Padre!
Unhand him, you animatronic fiends.
What are you two doing here?

You disobeyed me.

Batman, you're on a timeout.
What?

No.

Guys, you're all un-timeouted!
We have incoming!
- Sir!

Okay.

Whoo-hoo!

- Batman, I can help you.

The rope is fine!
Save Master Dick!
I'm fine.

No!
Dick...
Gotcha!
Hold on, Alfred.

No!
Alfred!
No.
No!
Move over, rope.
Hold on!
Gotcha!
Barbara, did you see that?
Batrope saved Alfred.
Sick moves, rope.

Actually, sir, Ms. Gordon saved him.
Rope!

Wait a minute.

Alfred would have been street meat?
Batman, trust us.
We can do this.
- Yeah.

It's a gymnastics-based martial art.
I can punch those '80s monsters off the plane.
Uh...

Multiple bogeys on our six.
Sir, I'll get them off our back.
I was a tail gunner for the Royal Air Force.
Locked and loaded, sir!
Good.

I got an idea.

I want you to fly straight into that flaming eyeball.
- What?

All right.

We got a giant sea monster, 12 o'clock!
Got it.
- We've got his attention.

I've got you now.
Eat dirt!
Bob's your uncle, you ruddy duff cobblers!
Okay, Babs, this is it.
Fly us straight into that eye, and wait for my signal.
Can it come now?
Can we make the signal thing happen?
Almost there.
Almost there!
- Fire!

That fire's coming in hot!
Hot, hot, hot!
Now!

My eye!
Sauron!
Nothing to see.
Whoo-hoo!
- Yes!

That was so great!

Come on, let's hear it for us!
That was incredible!
I felt so jazzed!
I say "jazzed"!
I gotta give it to you, Batman.

- Ha!

- And you were awesome.

And you were awesome, and I was amazing.
I'm not trying to make it about myself, obviously.
But I just wanna make sure that everyone gets a pat on the back.
- Because it feels good.

You had a good idea, you had a good idea, and you had a good idea, and I had a great idea.
You know what, I think that collectively, I'm gonna add one.
- No way!

Man, that feels good.
Best team ever!
Let's take a photo!

Hang on a second.
- Nice and close!

- It's worth it.

These abs are no fluke.
Everyone say, "Bat Family!"
Bat Family!
Ooh, let's take a look!
Look at that!
- Splendid.

Didn't it turn out great?
Hey, guys!

- Hey, Bat-Dad.

Whoa.

I'm trying to give you a big, old H-U-G.
Okay, just...
Batman, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
We are just one big happy fraternity of people who did an awesome job together.
I can't think of any other way to put that.
- Cool.

Taking the Projector from the Joker is gonna be our most dangerous mission yet.
- A family battle mission!

Salvage what you can out of the Scuttler, and maybe root around, see if you can find a few Vitamin waters or something, and then we'll head out.
- Right away, sir.

I think I'll need snowshoes.
Yeah, I don't think you'll need snowshoes, but could you grab that flashlight?
- Batman?

Sir?
What are you doing?

Please, wait!
'Puter.
Yes, sir?
I'm locking in some coordinates now.
Take the Scuttler to the taco stand on the border of Gotham City and Blüdhaven.
No!
I want you to get these guys a couple of chimichangas
- and three Jarritos.

And then keep them there until this whole attack on Gotham City blows over.
Padre, please.

Batman, you need us!
How many times I gotta tell you?
Batman works alone.
No, we have to stick together.
Please.
Now go on, Scuttler.

- Go!

- Padre!

Please!
Just go.
Batman!

Scuttler, move out!
You're doing the wrong thing!
- Listen to me!

No!
Scanning for intruders.

Scanning for intruders.
Hi, Bats.
What have you done to my...
Bruce Wayne's house?
You'd better hope he's a cool guy and doesn't go crazy.
What happened to all your friends?
I don't need friends.

Are you sure about that?
Look in the mirror, Batman.
When I saw you working with your friend-family,
I actually thought you'd changed.
But, no.
You pushed them away.
You've run away from every other person in your life.
But I'm the one you're always chasing.
Is this about that stupid "greatest enemy" thing?
No, it's not.
Not anymore.
- You tell him, Joker!

He's not worth it.
I think after 78 years, I deserve respect!
That is right.

Do you realize that you have never once said the words,
"I hate you, Joker"?
Not once.
Well, I am starting to feel pretty annoyed with you right now.
That's for darn sure.
Annoyed is not the same thing!
Listen, Batman.
I... hate you.
- Aww!

Now you say it.
Me, too.
You won't.

'Cause you can't.

Batman will never change.
You know what, boo-boo?

These diseased lunatics are right.
Yes, we are!
I am not gonna be part of a one-sided relationship any longer!
- Yes!

- You and I are done!

I'm moving on!
That's ridiculous.
And on my way out,
I'm gonna blow up Gotham City!
No.

Wingardium Leviosa!
No!
You know what?

I'm not your greatest enemy.
Your greatest enemy is you.
- Goodbye, Batman.

Good for you, boo-boo!
- Yay!

- Bomb, bomb, bomb.

Say goodbye, Gotham City!
- Whoa.

Whoa!
Oh, I am so sorry.
It was all my fault, I keep doing that.
Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy.
What are you talking about?
I'm not a bad guy.
But you're all in black.

And you wear a big, scary mask.
Well, I'm not.
And you kicked me in the face.
Listen, I'm Batman.
Oof!

I swear, I am a good guy.
Okay, Mr. Batman.
Hold still while I scan you.
Scanning for badness.
Yes, sir?
- You're super nimble, right?

And 110% expendable?
I don't know what that means, but okay.
- How'd I do, Dad?

- Yes!

Sorry.
Alfred, put that kid on the next jet to the orphanage.
But doesn't he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing, as I took you under mine?
Listen, you don't have a family.
So what do you know about having a surrogate son?
Batman!
We have to stick together.
Please.
Joker, you mean nothing to me.
No one does.
Huh.

But you're not exactly a good guy, either.
- Batman?

You even abandoned your friends.
What?
Go on, Scuttler.

- Batman, no.

Abandoned?

No, I was trying to protect them.
By pushing them away?
Well, yeah.
Are they really the ones you're protecting?
Computer, Batman's in danger.
Please, Computer, take us back!
Do you really want the man who made you to come to harm?
Batman programmed me to obey him.
But he didn't say to not not rescue him.
What are they doing?
Come on, guys.

Gotham City's not gonna blow itself up.
Well, hello!
'Puter, go to super-secret stealth mode.
- Hold on!

Evil buddies, those are my last three painful reminders of Batman.
Run!
Come on, Alfred.

Wait, where's Dick?
The little guy?

Initializing Batcave operating system.
What's he doing?
I've gotta save my family!
Just think.
- What would Batman do?

I know.

Destroy as much property as possible.
Talk in a really low, gravelly voice.
And go it alone.
Kid, don't do that.
Atomic batteries to power.
Turbines to speed.
Don't do what I would do!
I never even taught you how to drive!
Hold on a second, Brick Lady.
I'm so sorry.

I can't let you go.

Yeah.

Hmm.

Then let me try.

But haven't you tried that before?
This way, Alfred.
You do the same thing over and over.
What's gonna change?
No!
I know what I need to do.
Just give me 24 hours, and I'll come back.
Whoa!
You've gotta let me go down there and save them.
I'll do whatever you want.
- Please.

Please.
Okay, but I need all the bad guys locked up in here.
I promise.
And I mean all of them.
One of these buttons has to save my friends.
Self-destruct mode activated.
Self what?
- Master Dick!

Dick!
Look who's bat!
What?
Everyone okay?

- Are you guys...

Listen, I just wanted to say that I'm really,
really, really, really, really, really, really, really... s-s-s...
Soooo...
Sorry?
Yeah.

I don't even know why you bothered coming back.
I was afraid.
What?
The reason I came back was the same reason I left you.
I was afraid of feeling
the pain you feel when you lose
someone close to you.
Gotham needs us.
So I came back to do this.
Flip.
Flip?

You gotta turn around.
I call it the Babs-Signal.
And I'm flipping the switch for you.
Because saving this city is too big a job for one person.
Flip, flip.
So, what do you say, Commish?
Will you work with me?
I need your help.
I thought you'd never ask.
I'm very, very proud of you, sir.
But there's still only four of us against Joker's entire army.
That's why I called in some backup.
Flip!

- Whoa!

Joker may be done with us, but we're not done with him.
We will be the Joker's reckoning.
Joker said mean stuff to us.
You were right, Barbara.
It takes a village.

Okay.

These monsters want to destroy Gotham City.
That's right.

An arsenal of advanced weaponry.
Costumes that suit our individual personalities.
Rip!
And code names to use on our walkie-talkies.
Call it out!
Your name is Lady Bat.
- Lady Bat?

- Veto!

How about a cool costume?
Nice!
That one's called Batgirl.
If you call me Batgirl, can I call you Batboy?
And lastly, a coordinated attack strategy, and a kick-butt theme song!
Robin?
My superhero code name.
Oh, yeah.

Got it!
No!
Absolutely not.
This music is filling me with rage.
Let's use it!
All right, team.

I'm a giant clay person!
- I'm irritating.

I make unpredictable decisions.
I raise the stakes!
I can squirt ketchup!
Nice!

I'm a whale!
Oh, we got this covered!
Go team!
Whale, yeah!
Shh.

Who's laying down those funky beats?
- We are!

Batman?
Evil army, get rid of them!
Team Gotham Family, activate!
Voldy's got this.
Here we go!
Yeah!
Bombarda!
Smash!

- Whoa.

I'll get that Projector!
10-4, Co-Go.
Freeze, Clayface, take this guy out!
Coming through!
Okay, Alfred, bring the pain.
Bringing it, sir.

You just got Union Jacked!
Robin, get ready.
I'm about to teach you some father-and-son stuff.
First, driving.
- Put your hands at 10 and 2.

Now, fly!

Run over these skeletons.
Now drive up the wall!
- Great driving.

Yeah!
Okay, Robin.
Together, we're gonna punch these guys so hard, words describing the impact are gonna spontaneously materialize out of thin air.
Yeah!
Yes!

High five!
Stop moving around, you Muggles.
All right, team, let's shut him down.
Orca!

You wanna see a magic trick?
I'm gonna make you disappear.
- Wingardium Levio...

Wingardium Levio...

No!
Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy!
Fudgecake!
Whoo!

Batman, think fast!
Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy!
Robin, go long.
- Nice grab.

Oh, my gosh.

Here you go, Grandpa.
Hey, Batman!
Get off my padre!
It wasn't useless after all.
End this, Batgirl!
Adiós, shark.
Okay, BRB, guys.

This is the end of Gotham City!
As I predicted, we're doomed!
We're not doomed.

Everyone, grab on to me.
Gotcha.
Come on, guys.

Batrope, no!
Everybody, run!
No!

Right, Batman?
We need to use our heads!
Maybe we should build something together.
- Heads.

- Build something.

- Build.

We should build something together.
I got it.
You're right, Babs.

Literally.
Robin, quick.

On it, Padre.
We're gonna stick together, using our heads, and the most powerful weapon of all.
Shredded abs.

- Meow, meow.

- Ready?

You got this, Alfred?
Yes, sir.

Great!

No!
- Batman, what's going on?

I've got you.
Joker!
Please, help us!
No!

At least if this city is destroyed, I'll die knowing
I'm your greatest enemy!
I'm gonna have to die to know it.
Shut up, Joker!

What?
You're the reason why I get up at 4:00 in the afternoon and pump iron until my chest is positively sick.
You're the reason I've given up a life spent with Russian ballerinas and lady activewear models.
And if it wasn't for you,
I never would have learned how connected I am with all these people.
And you.
So if you help me save Gotham, you'll help me save us.
You just said "us."
Yeah.

What do you say?
You had me at shut up.
How are your abs, bro?
Too much flab, not enough ab.

Because I need you to crunch them.
Citizens of Gotham, we need all of you to join us and help bring this city back together.
I'm just gonna come right out and say it.
I hate you, Joker.
- I hate you, too.

I hate you the most.
I hate you forever.
Splendid!
We did it, everyone!
Bane is feeling warm and fuzzy.
Padre, where are you going?
I made a promise.
I gotta go back to the Phantom Zone.
Sorry, kid.
Padre, please.
Don't call me Padre.
Okay.
Call me...
Dads.
My two dads are the same dad.
But they're both leaving.
It's gonna be okay, kid.
Sometimes, losing people is part of life.
But that doesn't mean you stop letting them in.
Some very wise people taught me that.
My father figure.
My platonic coworker buddy, who's a girl, but just a friend.
And you.
Mi hijo.
It's Spanish for "son."
This is my family, but it's your family, too.
Do you have a knife?
Why?
'Cause someone needs to cut the tension between the two of us immediately.
Okay.

- Hi.

What's going on?
I came back, just like I said I would.
You know, Mr. Batman, when you're a talking brick, working at the Phantom Zone, you see a lot of crazy things.
But I've finally seen a man, in order to make the world a better place, take a look at himself and make a change.
Who?
- Superman.

I'm kidding.

Well, I guess I'll be seeing you on the streets, Batman.
I guess so.

Let's go, gang.
Wait a minute, we're not just gonna let these criminals go, right?
Ah, come on, Commish.

Those guys are no match for the four of us.
We'll give them a 30-minute head start.
Besides, you can't fight crime on an empty stomach.
Hey, Computer?
We're home!
What is the password?
Iron Man sucks!
When Dad and me were fighting, I was giving them my best one-liners.
You complete me.
Holy family photo, Batman.

White.
All important movies end with a white screen.
And tying up loose ends.
We're coming for you, Gotham City!
Like this snake clowns bit.
- Snake clowns?

Did you stick wigs onto snakes?
- Maybe.

Can I play that song I wrote for the end credits?
- That is a hard pass.

No!
Let the kid play whatever music he wants.
- No, no, no!

- No.

Fine. 'Puter.
Okay, sir.
Yay!
Now playing Robin's happy, poppy music.
The kind that makes parents and studio executives happy.
Come on, everyone!
- Come on, Batman!

Wow, that was fun!
Really hope nobody was recording that.
Let me see.
