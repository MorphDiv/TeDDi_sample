PLANET EARTH
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...
Alpha, I am the only one left.
We must stop her.
Send the meteor to my coordinates.
Seek only those who are worthy.
Find only those who are strong.
With the Zeo Crystal, we could have ruled the Universe together.
That was never going to happen.
Then you will die, Zordon.
We will die together, Rita.
It had to be a cow couldn't feel like a dog or something that isn't 10 thousand pound.
Pull yourself together.
Yo, just tight the pinch and let's get out of here.
The cow seems unhappy.
I should not be unhappy because I just milked her.
I was gonna say it was actually kind off.. it was big.
I had to use two hands...
I think great.
Cops!
The cops are coming!
Beefcake, hide!
Look out there, what!
Okay.
Subtitled By Asmita/BioHapzard 3 weeks later
You know, I don't think we are ever gonna understand each other.
Just when you think you've done the dumbest thing you could possibly do...
You find something even dumber and you do it.
Thank you.
I promise you this is not the moment to be a wise ass.
I know you think it's noble that you didn't rat out your friends
I acted alone Beefcake and I had a connection.
This was supposed to be your season.
I had Scouts coming to every game, you could have written your own ticket.
Now it's all gone!
Now you're gonna come here every Saturday for the rest of the year...
Just so you can graduate.
With all these other weirdoes and criminals.
Yeah.
Like you said, we will never understand each other.
Will they level in their game?
Jason Scott takes his position at quarterback.
Here comes the snap, wide receiver Marty Borne looks like he is open.
He's getting ready for a pass.
Jason Scott makes the.. no, no, wait, he doesn't make the pass.
He's running with the ball, he is at the 20 the 15, the 10...
Jason Scott single handedly brings Angel Grove to the Championship.
Moo...
That's so bad.
This one goes here, that one goes there, this goes from..
This side... some.
You're freak, you know that?
No.
What if you had an extra one?
Why don't you cut this and do something?
Why do not you stop me?
How old are you five?
It's exciting!
Did you just slap me?
Don't sit near me or him.
Then we'll be okay.
Oh my God!
I got your text and I was like, "Where are they?"
So this is where you come every Saturday instead of practice.
Well, then you shouldn't have sent,
Try that picture of me.
That's not exactly how it happened, I mean he is a liar.
Water under the, let's move on.
Oh Thank God.
We are moving on without you.
Cutting you out.
Literally.
You can chill for cheer practice if you want, but I wouldn't.
God damn!
Kimberly what have you done with your hair.
You cut off your hair?
Whoa, Look!
The door!
Hey thanks for that in there.
No worries, I hate guys like that.
Yeah.
Oh so, hey, we should hang out sometime huh?
Not that we had to, I think tonight we should.
Billy Cranston.
Or William Cranston.
Remember Cage use to call me "Billie Cramp stones".
As a third grade joke like Billy Cramp stone is a crayon in his butt.
So, I am sorry.
Truth is I need to get somewhere tonight, and I could really use your help.
Billy I hear you, but as I told you I have house arrest.
There is nothing I can do about, I am sorry.
I mean, I can fix that.
I know how to trick this in, I have, I have tools.
I have to be in my house before seven.
Well, If you come to my house before seven, then I can fix it for you.
I also have a car, or access to a car.
And If you decide to help me, you can have the car for a few hours.
Don't be so hard on him.
How do you think he feels walking around town?
He could have been so much more.
Oh My God, is that Jason Scott?
Billy?
Yeah.
What's all this stuff?
These are the things that.
I found at my dad's, most stuff are his.
Here, Here it is!
My dad's been dead now, seven years four months and... two days?
Billy, I really don't think that we have time...
About my dad, we used to go and find objects together.
Almost like that show American Pickers.
Billy, the signal's gonna go off.
We should definitely head on to a TV show that would've been so crazy.
What are you doing?
Billy, come on!
What?
Thank you.
Can you stop touching me now?
It's so cool you actually showed up.
Lending you the van, but yeah.
How much further is it?
Just 44 minutes and 52 seconds.
It's okay, Billy.
This is the entrance to the Gold Mine, and clearly Billy, the sign says...
Keep driving.
Okay.
Look, if we find something cool, then you can keep the half.
It's a rule that...
They are gonna blow this whole thing.
It will all be gone in a week now.
Billy, can I be honest?
The deal was I drop you somewhere I get the van for few hours okay?
I don't know what we are doing here, and you seem...
I'm on the spectrum.
See that's the thing, I did not get the joke.
Like my brain doesn't work the same as yours does.
Yeah, well, consider that a good thing.
It's just that I can't read humor or sarcasm.
You do not need to tell me all of this.
We are cool.
Cause it's gonna be dark when you get back.
Bye, Billy!
Okay!
Ah, she's back again.
The crazy girl.
Just like clockwork.
Who are you?
No way!
Hello?
Hey!
Hey!
No, no, no.
Kimberly!
Kimberly!
It's strange to hear you say my name.
What?
What did you say?
I said it's strange to hear you say my name.
Like we know each other.
We do know each other.
Oh, we know who each other are, but we don't really know each other.
I know you used to date Ty Fleming.
Then you know I punched his tooth out.
I know they put it back.
Dad, I hope you're watching I'm gonna make you proud.
Dad I forgot to tell you I took the van without asking Mom's permission.
I'm telling you, so I think that's okay.
Anyways, I gotta focus.
I came with Billy.
But I've seen him up here before.
My house is on the other side of the mountain.
I hike these trails sometimes to clear my head.
And I stare down at Angel Grove and wonder how such a small crap town... can cause me such misery.
That funny to you?
Now walking around town, and everyone's looking me like I ran over their dogs.
So why don't you leave?
I can leave here, you know?
Where?
God, anywhere.
So let's go.
So let's go.
Good.
Dad, get ready.
That didn't work.
That really run my bell.
Go, go, go, go!
What are you doing, dude?
I've digging up here for some years.
You cannot walk around blow stuffs up.
I was just trying to dig a little deeper.
Maybe I dug too deep huh.
You guys looking to get busted or something?
This place is a restricted area.
As in we shouldn't be standing on a crazy rock doing some Karate kid moves right.
Guys...
There is a lot of mine security out tonight.
Oh no.
What?
Watch out!
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm ok.
Whoa!
What is it?
I have never seen glass like this before.
Oh My God.
There is something in there.
Hey.
Move!
Yeah!
My dad always knew the right spots.
There's gotta be more.
What is it?
What's that?
Wow, What?
Oh My God, what is that?
Yo look, we all found these...
Guys, guys, do you hear that?
Someone should have pointed that out.
Wait, I did.
Billy!
I don't know.
Okay.
Hold on!
What did you do?
My mom's gonna kill me.
Jason, somebody's gonna die!
I don't do...
Get your foot!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Go, go go!
Good.
There they are!
Get in!
Got you.
What about the other guy?
Billy look out!
Guys, guy, it's the train!
We got it.
Okay.
Oh my, oh my God!
Hey.
Okay.
Are you crazy?
Yeah, I am.
Just catching up.
You got it.
You got it.
I got it, I got it.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Hold it forward!
Let's go.
Let it go!
..The hell is that?
Get back!
Everything to port!
Good.
Okay.
Yeah...
Billy, what's happening?
What?
I'm just gonna quietly snap your wrist, you little bitch.
No, no, no...
Okay.
Billy Cranston just knocked Colt Wallace out cold.
Hi, Billy.
Hey, come on, come on.
I don't remember getting home from the mine at all.
I slept all day Yesterday.
We gotta find Billy.
You know, I wasn't trying to start any trouble or anything like that.
But if you must come at me, come at me, bro.
Billy.
Hey, Kimberly, Kimberly Hart.
We need to talk.
Since when does he knows Kimberly Hart?
Billy is awesome.
Nice hair.
Do you feel weird?
You mean like weird than usual?
Listen.
We know something happened out there, okay?
I'm not the same.
I feel like we need to go back out there.
The counter is boiling.
I'm going back today.
Sure it's a woman?
Oh the smell is...
It's intense.
You should make a note of that.
Smell inside of a north fishing boat that hold tons of dead fish...
Look, do you need us?
There's beers in the fridge.
Jesus.
Jesus.
Let's just keep going.
Find anything interesting?
If I do, I'm keeping it.
We know why you're here.
Oh ya?
You guys wake up surprised to be alive and jump over a house.
You're Zack, right?
Yup.
You still got Angel Grove?
Sometimes.
The other girl was here too about an hour ago.
Hey, You mean that girl right there?
We solve together!
Wow!
Oh screw this.
No no no!
Yo, Keep up.
Stop!
Just, just talk to me.
Whoa ho!
What is wrong with you?
Woah woah!
Huh!
Just jump over.
I'm gonna jump across with her and then you jump, okay?
Piece of cake.
That's not a piece of cake.
You got this, Billy!
C'mon, c'mon.
The drop is probably more than 100 feet which means death is imminent.
But she couldn't, cause you love your momma.
Let's do it.
Okay!
Billy, you got this.
Oh shit!
Told you, see?
Yes!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
He's fine.
Bring that crazy girl.
Whoa!
Hey!
Can I get a sip of your water?
I'm dying.
Sorry for what?
Welcome to the club!
What's up, crazy girl?
We gotta do that again.
What?
I'm blue!
It's not my favorite color, but it's cool.
I am black!
No, you're not.
Hey, guys.
There's something down there, follow me.
Hi.
Again?
Well, that is unusual.
It just gets better and better.
Do you feel that?
Something out here.
The walls are shaking.
Come on.
That is impossible.
This must have been here for millions of years.
Look how the rocks is growing around it.
I do not like this place.
Hey, guys.
Check it out.
Okay.
It's so cold in here.
Jason, is this real?
Like are we really in a spaceship right now?
It's okay.
We should go now?
There's something here.
Woah!
What is that?
What's going on?
No way out.
I'm going.
Run!
C'mon, c'mon.
Didi, I'm coming.
They're real!
Leave her alone!
We will kill you.
There's five of us.
Wait, where is the other guy?
No no no.
All of you.
Then, 65 million years.
I've been very lonely.
You all so young looking.
No one said you're here!
Turn around.
Go on.
No way.
Proceed.
I think this will work.
Guys, focus on getting out of here.
Stay together and when we see a chance, we run like hell.
I am Alpha 5, persona Android.
What?
Billy!
What the hell.
Okay.
Fascinating.
Zordon, nice to hear your voice.
I can see you, Alpha but I can't see me.
Where am I?
You're inside the ship.
Sir, I sealed your essence into the ship's matrix.
C'mon.
But the ship is on?
The power coins have finally returned to the ship.
Go, go, go.
Where are the coins?
Where are the rangers?
Come forward, please.
Do we have a choice?
I do not think so.
They speak a primitive dialect called English.
You'll find it in the ship's matrix.
What?
Zordon, they don't know who you were.
Come in, come in.
Funny, I said the same thing.
You mean to tell me that the fate of the universe, placed in the hands of these children?
It's hard to explain really.
Show me the coins.
The Morphing Grid is never wrong.
If the power coins have returned to the ship with these...
Teenagers!
With these teenagers... then these teenagers are the Power Rangers.
Power Rangers!
What?
Okay, a quick question.
Did I just hear you say we're Power Rangers?
I have a question.
Kids used to called me Billy Cramps...
Sorry.
The images here in this sphere tell the history of the Power Rangers.
Looks like the Power Rangers were a team that protected life?
And every planet in the universe that has life.
Has a piece of the Crystal buried inside it.
65 million years ago, Zordon's team died... defending the Crystal here and what is now Angel Grove.
The Coins have chose you five.
Now you must protect the Zeo Crystal and life on Earth.
Because we are the Power Rangers?
He's smart!
I'm sorry, is this some kind of a joke?
Like I'm standing here, with a wet wedgies.
My socks are so squiggling around,
Silence!
Sir, I am detecting elevated heart rate.
They are very scared.
I don't understand.
Why would you show us that nightmare?
It's not a nightmare.
Her name is Rita Repulsa.
She will create Goldar, a huge monster who will rip the crystal from the earth... and all life on your planet will die.
With the Crystal, Rita will have the power to create and destroy worlds.
My best guess is that we have 11 months.
If we are the Power Rangers and this is our ship...
If I walk through that door right now will it open for me?
Yes of course.
Come on.
Wait, what are you doing?
No, no, no, come back!
My ranger team died defending the Crystal from Rita.
That's why I'm in this wall.
How do you know my name?
Because it's you, Jason Scott.
Rita was a Ranger too, and my friend.
But she betrayed us.
Wanted more power.
She lost her way.
Now she is just pure evil.
You must bring them back all of the Rangers.
You must train your team to stop Rita... before she has the strength to find the crystal.
You know that deep down what I am saying is true.
You were born for this.
Who exactly are you?
I have been in Angel Grove, for over a year now we have Biology together.
None of us really know each other, okay?
Bu somehow, we were all in the same place... at the same time when Billy found those coins.
And.
Are we really superheroes?
We're More like Iron Man or Spider-Man?
Cause I feel like I've been bit by a spider, but I feel really good...
You're not a superhero.
Why are you talking like to us like you're the boss?
But I know that the answer to what's wrong with us... and what's happening to us, is here.
I think we gotta come back.
I can't make you come back here, but 4'o clock tomorrow
I will be here.
Of course!
I do not know, I didn't think about that one in the first place.
Because she's like a ghost around here.
She needs to start communicating.
Okay, relax.
Okay, Trini, let's start over.
Please tell us one thing you did today.
Me and four kids from Angel Grove found a spaceship buried underground.
What?
I'm pretty sure I'm a superhero.
Cool!
Not cool.
Pee in that cup!
It's to remind me of my screw up?
No.
Wrecking yard only offered me 300 bucks for it.
You know the frame's straight and the engine still runs.
A series of grisly crimes scenes has the sleepy fishing hamlet of Angel Grove reeling
bodies were discovered on a fishing boat.
This raft of violence..
What the hell are you doing?
I need gold, I build my beautiful Goldar.
Goldar takes the Zeo Crystal I take the universe.
They do!
So Crazy girl.
Hey.
Shall we do this?
You need to follow the three rules to being a Power Ranger.
You must never use your powers for personal gain.
And you must never reveal your identity. ever.
To assume your ranger identities you need to morph.
Have any of you morphed before?
Yes, but only in the shower.
Okay, okay, let's step into the footprints, please.
Let's try this.
Standing in this circle as a team,
You can easily connect to the morphing' grid.
Do you feel it?
Yeah they do.
No, not feeling it.
You need to morph to get your armor.
You already have it inside of you.
You bring it out by connecting to each other.
And connecting to the Morphing grid.
Bury your minds and focus.
Power Rangers were a legion of warriors sworn to protect life.
Yes!
They must become those warriors.
Become the warriors!
What?
Alpha 5, why they didn't they morph?
We don't have time!
If they can't morph, what are we supposed to do?
They will have to train without armor, they need to prepare.
Take them down to the pit.
Jason I don't want to find out what the pit is.
Alpha 5, begin the exercise.
Sorry, guys.
These creatures before you are simulations of Rita's army.
They are called... to get to her.
No, no, no, Jason.
Strong ass hologram.
Not a video game.
This is why you must morph into your armor.
If Rita becomes strong enough to build her army...
The real beginning of the end.
Rangers Welcome to training.
I'm so excited you guys are back.
Aim for the center..
Once more time.
No let's try that again.
This is exciting.
Yeah, Trini!
Ready, master Billy?
You need to learn the element of surprise.
Billy, light on your feet.
Hands up.
Lucky shot.
You guys all know you can be murdered, right?
No.
You must shade your own mask to wear this armor.
I don't feel anything!
No.
Take them down to the pit.
Watch me.
Slip, grab, lift!
Yeah!
Slip, grab, lift!
Yes!
We SHOULD start a band
Think only of each other and the morphing grid will open to you.
It's working?
Try harder!
I have been concentrated though.
All we need to do is just concentrate...
Come on. let's go to train.
The information we need to triangulate the location of...
The Crystal was lost in the battle.
Billy Are you listening to me?
Billy What are you doing?
Billy!
Where is the crystal Find him, Billy, find him.
Where is the crystal?
There.
17 degrees north...
Hey, idiot, watch where you're going.
Krispy Kreme DOUGHNUTS
Two fishermen were led to rest today at St Andrews cemetery.
Residents of Angel Grove are feeling the shock.
Fear has the town on edge.
The series of murders has police baffled... as police have linked the loss of gold to each crime scene.
What is now being Angel Grove's gold killer is still on the loose/.
If Rita manages to create Goldar...
Are you listening to me?
And he rips the crystal from the ground..
..It will be like ten thousand nuclear bombs washing over earth.
That supposed to freak us out?
Feel free to throw us a bone at some point.
Yes, I see you busting your asses.
So I've decided to give you some inspiration.
What you will find beyond this wall will forever change your life.
Come on.
They take on the form of most powerful organism on the planet.
When these Zords formed, dinosaurs reigned supreme.
They will be an extension of you.
And there power is all but limitless.
They are incredible.
But you are not ready for this power.
When you morph, your armor will make you one with the zords.
Today is the day you become Rangers!
I can feel it!
Okay.
Let's go.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Out of the way!
Oh, Tailing on the mountain.
After you remember that today's train lesson the important thing is to...
Seriously?
It's bad!
You're alright?
What's your problem?
You could've killed yourself, or us.
Stop fighting, please!
What?
Stand still.
Yeah!
Zack, do not touch.
Where'd it go?
Bring it back, bring it back, dude.
Get out.
Come on, do it again.
Okay, we don't know how.
That's what I thought.
If you can't morph, You are not Rangers.
Go home, all of you.
Now what?
Hey, guys.
I'm down.
Alright.
Cool.
Jason's failing experiment.
I shall destroy Rita myself.
There must be a way to free me from this wall.
Yes, but the irony is that you need these rangers to morph.
If they morph, you can harness that energy... to regenerate your body and come back through.
Wait for us dumb kids to morph so that you can come back to life.
That's what all this has been about, right?
You coming back?
This has only ever been about to protecting the crystal
Rita could be building Goldar as we speak.
Don't underestimate me or my team.
You can't stop him..
She will have him dig up the crystal and life on earth..will die.
And we need you.
Because you were so successful in stopping her last time.
I died burying those coins...
In hopes they will find next real Rangers.
Those who are worthy.
I'm sorry to disappoint you!
I don't need to stand here and have you tell me what I did wrong.
I can go home and get that.
To help lead this team!
Your team is dead.
And you're just as scared as we are.
These are off 24 carat Gold.
I'll be right with you.
You're so sweet.
I'll be right back.
Can I help you?
Gold.
I'm interested... gold.
Yeah.
We have some very nice pieces here.
Come closer.
This.
Give it to me!
Grow.
Grow.
Do it, I say, lady!
Lady?
I like the sound of lady.
Get on the ground and you won't get hurt.
Unit 5, I need backup at Jewelers Phoenix.
Down!
It's been too long since I raised my beautiful creatures.
Did you miss me?
Oh my God.
Kill him.
"How we are stuck in this wall I will make that jump."
What happened back there?
Nothing, don't worry about it.
Billy, how'd you do it?
How'd you morph?
I don't know.
What do you guys saying him about one more trying to morph?
"You must shade your masks to wear this armor."
"Think only of each other and the morphing' grid will open to you".
Yeah, that's better.
Or maybe it's Cause we don't know each other.
Maybe that's why we can't morph.
Okay.
No, I am serious, let's do this for real
I am Jack and I am a Power Ranger.
True
I live in the Melody mobile home park.
It's just me and my mum.
And my mom?
My mom is the best!
But my Mom. she's sick.
I do what I can... but I'm scared.
Sometimes I get too scared to stay the night because I'm afraid she can't make it.
And if she goes...
When she goes...
I got nobody else.
Look.
I think being with you guys is good for me.
Let's do that.
Let's tell our secrets it will help us.
Okay, I got a secret.
As a matter of fact, I love country music.
And I don't...
I don't miss my dad that much
I mean coming to the mine with him was all I had.
But.. coming to the mine with you guys is just as good.
Yeah.
Biggest secret is why're you in detention.
But it was an accident.
My lunch box was in my locker boom goes the lunch box, in detention goes Billy.
But let's not forget that Kimberly Hart was also in detention too so...
Not tonight.
Skip me.
What about you dude?
Why don't you tell us who you really are?
Because everyone knows exactly who I am.
Okay.
What about you, crazy girl?
I could tell you anything and you would have to believe me.
Okay.
I'm the new girl.
Always.
Three schools in three years.
I like it that way, you know, it's just easier.
Nobody ever has to get to know me... my parents don't have to worry about my relationships.
Boyfriend troubles?
Yeah.
Boyfriend troubles.
Girlfriend troubles.?
My family is so normal.
Too normal.
They believe in labels.
They would like for me to... dress differently.
Talk more.
Have the kinds of friends they want me to have.
I don't know how to tell them what's really going on with me.
I never said any of this out loud.
Am I?
What does that mean?
When all this is over?
Are we Power Rangers or?
Are we friends?
Do you know who I am?
Yes.
I was once just like you.
So pretty.
Innocent.
Are all the rangers on Zordan's new team as young as you?
Delightful!
Have you morphed yet?
Trick question.
If you could morph, we would be having a very different conversation.
The Yellow Ranger.
Should I kill you?
I killed the yellow Ranger before.
And I loved it!
Oh, you want your armor.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
No, please, you're hurting me.
You are so strong!
I'm just kidding.
You've guts full, little yellow!
I see myself in you.
I was an outsider on Zordan's team, just like you.
All I need to know is... where is the Zeo Crystal.
I don't know.
Sadly, I believe you.
Tomorrow I am going to destroy Angel Grove.
But in exchange for your life... you will find out where that crystal is and you will come to me.
We can have a little deal, Didi my friend.
How did you get in here?
So everything okay?
I think I'm the reason we can't morph.
I haven't really been honest.
Okay.
I punched Ty Fleming on the face... because he told everyone I was the meanest person he ever met.
And he was right.
Whoa!
But she shared it with me privately.
She trusted me.
And you sent that pic to Ty?
With a text that said.
"Is this the girl you wanna bring home to your mom?"
I did not know how mean it was until I saw her face.
Kim, there is literally thousands of photos going around school
I did this!
I had to sit in Mr. Detmer's office with Amanda's father... and watched as they showed him the photo of his daughter.
In his eyes for the first time I could see who I would become.
I wanted to die, that's why...
When you asked me to run away, I was ready.
Okay, listen.
You did an awful thing, that does not make you a awful person.
Just be the person you wanna be.
I'm here!
Look.
Rita came to my house tonight.
Insane.
She nearly killed me.
Act on the destruction of Angel Grove begins.
She said to me hear what the dead ships live.
That's the boatyard by the docks, right?
Let's go!
Are you serious?
No one?
I say we go back to Zordon.
Is so that he can come back to life.
Why makes you say that?
Because he told me.
We failed.
Let's stop being delusional about being a team of superheroes.
We are all screw-ups.
And as much as I hate this scrubby bullshit town...
I don't wanna just sit around and watch it die okay?
Let's go and do the one this that's been asked of us and kill Rita.
You know this is really a bad idea, right?
The worst.
Let's vote.
Shove hands.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's go.
Oh shit.
Right on time.
I was beginning to think you were too dumb to know where the dead ships live.
Let's play.
Five little Rangers tied up like fish.
The Leader?
Hello, Red.
You're not entirely disappointing.
Yellow has led you to your death.
Because I'm going to kill you... one by one, until you tell me...
Where's my crystal.
We don't know.
No, Red.
You don't know!
But guess what.
One of you does.
Who could it be?
Eeinie meenie mynie...
Blue.
Blue... so loyal.
Pure of heart.
Tell the class what you know!
Where is my crystal?
You can tell me now, Blue.
Or you can tell me after I kill all of your friends.
No.
He dies in three... two...
Okay, okay!
Don't hurt my friends, alright?
It's at doughnut establishment.
It's a Krispy Kreme.
Krispy Kreme?
The Source of life itself is buried there.
Thank you Blue for being so weak.
Zordon will lose all respect for me If I don't kill you.
No!
Billy!
Billy!
You are not ready to kill me.
You are not worthy.
Give me your hand!
Come on.
He's dead.
He is dead.
No.
We SHOULD start a band.
Pick him up.
Help me pick him up!
Come on!
Take him, take him to the cave.
Yeah.
Do something, ok?
There must be something you can do for him.
I told you that you were not ready.
There is nothing that I could do for him.
We were both reckless with our teams.
No.
I am sorry.
I'm sorry, guys.
He's dead because of me.
No, Jason, it was all of us.
No I pushed it.
And as usual, I made the wrong decision.
Out of fear, anger...
I don't know, It's just so angry.
He's a great kid, you know.
And he loved us.
He loved being a Ranger.
I'm sorry, Billy.
I'll trade my life for yours if I could.
Maybe he traded his life for us.
Yeah probably he did.
I would.
Me too.
Yeah me too.
Me too.
Just the four of us now.
The truth is... whatever we've said to each other...
It does not matter.
This... this is the only thing that matters.
She is right.
Zordon!
Do you see it?
The grid is open, step through!
Yes, I see it.
I see it.
Get through, Zordon!
The Morphin' grid is open!
What's going on?
Zordon?
Master?
Where is he?
He must have stepped through the grid!
Alpha where did he go?
I don't know where he is.
Zordan, what?
I know.
But only one can come back.
Oh my God.
Billy!
Are you okay?
You're not dead?
A little bit.
You guys bring me back to life.
I told you we were superheroes.
There can only be one Red Ranger.
Jason, this is your time.
This is your team.
Thank you.
That was incredible
I've seen my dad.
Welcome back, my friend.
We gottta go to Krispy Kreme, Jason.
What?
Not for doughnuts.
Thank you, Zordon.
It's morphin' time.
Come back to me, Goldar.
Came back.
Hold up.
Look.
Alright, let's do this.
Yes!
This is so much better with armor.
Come on!
Pick it up!
Billy, heads up!
Where are you going, Zack?
Make my monster grow.
I've missed you, my friend.
We're gonna push themselves off the edge!
Let's kill everyone.
Yo, did you guys see that?
Alright, who wants me to pimp there ride too?
At least you didn't crash, yeah?
Ah, guys?
We are too late.
Oh man!
That...
It's a lot of gold.
We're gonna protect the crystal, right?
We're going to Angel Grove.
Let's get the zords.
This is a lot different than the van.
Yippie-kay-yay, Motherfuck...
Mother is good, Mother's is good.
Go, go, Power Rangers!
Guys!
Our town.
She's destroying it.
Not there.
Rita and her golden boy haven't found Krispy Kreme yet.
Okay, Kim, you hold them there.
Zack, Billy, you circle the Krispy Kreme and make sure it's safe.
Kim, I'll go with you.
Let's go boys.
Surprise.
How cute.
The Rangers found their costumes and their dino cars.
Let's give them something else to play with.
Crush them!
How many of this you need?
This is insane.
Take that!
