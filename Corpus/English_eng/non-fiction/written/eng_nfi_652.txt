I know your father's pastor.

I guess that means you'll be baptized soon.
Yeah.

Ezekiel has an uncle in mexico.

And according to the law, we gotta give him back.
It's working.

You come and I will show you how to do this new process.
Nee.

There's a listening device and gps glued on the cover.
When we have what we need, we will hit eli so hard.
There'll be nothing left but his smoking boots.

I'm working with agent o'reilly.

An urgent message.

Hey, hey, hey!

Ok, ok.
Yeah?
God.
Excuse me.

Been suspended.

Pending an investigation.

I'm off the case.
This-this can't happen.
Ok, what-what about
Noah and-and the boy?

Voss knew we were coming.
He planned on it.

That they're still alive?

What about ezekiel?
I mean, you took him from abel and handed him to voss!
Are you ok with that?

We can't walk away from them.
These guys are part of our team.
What do you expect us to do?
The gps is still working.

It's almost like he's begging us to go after him.
Because he's in mexico!
Well, he's not a terrorist.

An average farmer that's flown under everybody's radar.
And that pisses you off.
There's something about eli voss that gets.
Under your skin because he's a man of god,
Hiding behind his religion.

By a broken-down ex-jock hoping get his job back.
You don't know anything about me!
My late husband,
All-american third baseman.
Full ride to louisiana state.

Ended up in a patrol car and then on vice.
Had to be the hero in every situation.
But no matter how many commendations.
Or barmaids came his way,
He could never get that special feeling back.
You know that one.
Keeps you up at night?

40?

37. 37 years old.
You are so afraid that your best days.
Are behind you.

Now that you're on suspension, you should probably.
Just soften up your edges just a little bit.
You are the most irritating man
I have ever met.
Thank you.
So what's our next move?
Onkel has a job for us.
The pastor's family.
No.

Why?

There'll be a fire at the funk house tonight.
And you, who are so good with a hammer,
Will nail the doors and windows shut.
That's all.
I won't do that!
I've had enough of your mouth, eefelt.
You wanted that big truck.
With the fog lights, and the easy money, yeah?
Then, this is how you pay for it.
Nee.

Not like that.

Like this.

I'd rather be a domkopp than a oaschloch.
I'm just trying to help.
She should never have been in town.
That's your influence.
What we are doing here,
It's none your business.
We'll take care of it ourselves.
I thought mennonites weren't proud.
You buy black clothes,
You learn a few words, and you pretend to be.
Something you can never be.
Is your own family so ferjchtalijch?
Jo, look that p on the google.
We are very grateful to you, ben,
All of us,
But I cannot accept the responsibility.
If something should happen to you while you are with us.
Like gerry epp?
Isaac won't fight him.
I will.
Having others do violence on our behalf.
Is the same as doing it ourselves.
After supper, you should go home.
Thank you.
You should leave.

Should get out of here.

I know that your brother hates that I'm here, but honestly, I'm worried about you.
You can't be involved in what happens next,
Whatever it is.
It's ok.
I know my place now.
And that's here, with my family.
I'm an edentale.
I always will be.
Do you have news about noah?

Onkel calle.
Gerry has his orders.
You have to run.
Come inside.
What?
I've been baking.
Come inside.
Butter?
I think that letting gerry.
Back into our business,
Letting him take over,
This is dangerous.
Do we even know if this is what your onkel want?
Is this what you want?
To go back to the way things were?
It hurts me to see the way that he treats you, joey.
You deserve better.
I pray that noah comes home,
But...

That he does not,
I will not spend the rest of my days.
Under your brother's thumb,
With my children at his mercy.
They don't need a prison.

They need a father.
A strong man,
Someone who will raise them as good,
God-fearing edentaler.
There is only one man who is stopping that.
From happening.
Try it.
We have a source on the inside.
Hola.

Our source is a mennonite pastor from a colony.
In canada.

Ezekiel janzen.

He's already killed his whole family and...
Hey, don't make me beg here, karla, ok?
I just need your help.

I'm sure you do.

I'm sure you did.

Is my asset, I recruited him.

And we need to go and get him.

We don't know that.

All the evidence you need is right there.
It's a goddamn slam dunk I just need your muscle, guns,
Warrants, the whole nine yards.

And a pony for christmas too?

We're serious, karla.
The bust is all yours, ok?

No.

This is our one chance.
If it goes down wrong, the blame is on us;

Then the collar's all yours, alright?
We were never there.
Hey,
How are the twins, karla?
What are your boys?

No.

This mennonite boy,
He's only 10 years old.
We won't leave him there.
Amen.
Set another place at my table.
There you are, kjinjabrooda.
It's time.
Yeah?

You want to be the big man or a big baby?
Because right now, all I see is a baby.
Watch and learn, brood.
You have my blood,
But you don't have the stomach.
Hey, big baby?
Got the big truck,
But not the big balls.

But you didn't get the little woman, did you?
Because women like anna funk, they don't like a baby.
Yaaaaaah!
Ya!
No, tinky.

Noah?
Not noah.

It's gerry.
I couldn't let him do it.
Do what?
I wouldn't let him hurt you.
No, of course not.
So i...

God, save me.
God, save me.

Ok.
We have to go.
I made it look like a suicide,
But no one that knows him would ever believe that.
Joey.

For you, for me,
For the children.

Jo.

No.
"No"?
We talked.
I have a husband.
Your husband is dead!
No!

He will protect noah too.

I protected you!

I can't live among the auslanders alone!
I...

You will have to pray for forgiveness.
And the rest is up to the lord.
Fuck!
My wife sat where you're sitting right now.
My daughters on this side,
My sons on that side.
Ten of us.
Ten of us.
Every meal,
I'd lead the prayer,
Say "amen" as you do.
Sunday morning,
On our way to the church house,
Some drunken cabrones.
Drive their truck.
Into our cart,
Leaving my family.
In pieces on the highway.
And all I can hear.
Over the screams of the horses,
The screams of my dying children,
My wife...
Is the song on the radio.
As they drive away.
A happy song.
A song for dancing.
You think I don't believe in god,
But you're wrong.
My god is terror.
My god is death.
Taking my family from me like he did.
Taking yours too.
He strikes us down,
Like weeds under a scythe,
And yet still,
You kneel.
And thank him.
I can't pretend to know his mind.
I can only know him as he makes himself.
Known to me.
And how does he do that, pradja?
When I was a boy, I had a fever.
So my father,
My mother, my brother abel, they all went.
To sunday service without me.
It was the first time in my life I was ever completely alone.
And,
Somehow, I got it into my head.
That the end of the world had arrived,
That the silence in our house.
Was the silence in heaven before the final judgment.
And I was scared.
That I had been forgotten,
That I was being.
Left to die alone in sin.
So I panicked.
I jumped out of bed, I ran out into the yard.
And that's when I saw him.
Coming down the driveway in the faces.
Of my mother, my brother,
My father.
And I knew then.
God is real,
God is kind,
God lives inside all of us.
And salvation is for everyone.
Even me?
Jo.
If you truly repent,
Even you.
Where's your mother?

Nee.

Where is she?

She said she had work to do.

Ho!

So she's the new pastor now too?
Is there anything that woman can't do?
I'll tell her you were here.

Nee, ne.
How about
I take you for a drive?
I can't ride in that.

Ja, ja, ja.

Fe'boden.

Nee.

And tie you my chain around your neck.
Like I did your father!
Drugs come in,
Money goes out,
And one person is in charge of it all.
What?

Yes, but I'm begging you.

Your brother lives there.
Isaac!
Isaac!
An abandoned meat-packing plant.
The gps is in noah's bible, along with the wire.
Still transmitting.

He's still alive.

Hasn't been destroyed.
That's all the muscle you could muster?
These are the men I trust.
As long as voss is in mexico, he has nothing to fear.
It's not like he's expecting company.
A gate, north end.
Alright.

Looks like every other mennonite male in the compound,
So your job to identify him and secure him.
While we engage voss and his crew.
Self-defence only.
You're observers, nothing more.
Any questions?
No.

You believe in god?
I do.
But he can't do everything.
That's why he created the police.
Your brother is dead.
The evidence against gerry epp has disappeared,
So he's now a free man,
Which means your family is dead too.
And now it's your turn.
That is your god, noah.
That is his answer.
To your prayers,
Your faith rewarded.
But...
I think you want this, jo?
You want to be a martyr,
Like the heroes in your book.
Hendrik eemkins.
Dirk willems.

Do you really believe.
That you will see god in the faces.
Of those that gathered to watch you die?
Let's find out.
Whoa!

Where were you?
Where's isaac?

Joey took him to where gerry...
Where we do our business.
Tina, the look.
On his face!

Do you know where he would go?

His baptism class?

It's alright.

And what will you tell him?

Class is over;
Where were you?

Are you alright?

Are you alright?
With all the evil in the world,
It is important we stay true to our ways,
To be good in heart.
And in deed...
And to raise a family according to god's word.
Yes.
So, do you see god.
In the eyes of your people, noah funk?
No!

Novak!

Noah!
Ok.

Take my gun!

Listen!

Novak!

Just go cover him!

Go!
Nee!
God!
Accept god into your heart.
Repent and pray for his mercy.
Noah.
You're alright, ok?
You did good, alright?
I'm gonna take care of you, I promise.
My family...
They're safe.
They're waiting for their father to come home.
It's alright.
You stay with me, ok?
You are certain this is god's will?
All that I know for certain is that...
Your father and I want you to accept Jesus christ.
Into your heart as your earthly guide and eternal saviour.
But, isaac, only you can make that choice.
Will voda be there?
Your father has told me.
That he is...

You spoke to him?

No, he sent me a text message.
What did he say?
"I am on my way."
Your father will do.
Everything in his power to be there.
Now, it is up to you.
Figured you'd want a front-row seat.
Got a tip that she'd booked a ticket to dominican republic.
No extradition.
Listen to you, world traveller.
Erica kingsley!
You are under arrest for breach of public trust,
A conspiracy to traffic narcotics.
And a conspiracy to commit murder.
You have a right to speak to a lawyer.
If you can't afford one, legal aid will provide you.
With counseling.

Turn around please.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
You know that if there's any way we can help,
All you need to do is ask.
Dank scheen.
In a town riddled.
With secrets.
I have something to show you.
Everyone.
Is a suspect.
Tell me the truth.
And I'll start trusting you.
