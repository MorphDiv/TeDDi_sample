I'm sorry, viewer.
The TV show you're searching for cannot be streamed in your reality.
Please stand by for reconnection.
In the darkest depths of cyberspace, there is another world.
A lost dimension, home to wonders unseen, terrors unspeakable.
Stories unlike any ever told until now.
Do not click back.
Do not reload.
We have reconnected to...

It's Time Jail for you, Entropy.
You haven't seen the last of me, Time Ryder.
I'll be back!
Yeah!
Now, before I take you back to your present,
I want you to always remember... ‐You are special.

You can achieve incredible things.
The greatest power in the universe is right between your ears.
♪ Time Ryder, Time Ryder ♪
Mom, can I watch one more?
I don't know, Sue.
Did you do your homework?
Not yet, I will after one more episode.
Please!
I'm almost done, I just need, like, one more day.
This is your final paper.
You had the whole semester.
‐I know, but‐‐ ‐I swear, every year
I get one kid with so much potential, they got their act together, they could change the world.
Paper's due at midnight.
You wanna graduate?
Then turn something in.
‐Hi, Mom.

Grandma's flying out for graduation!
That is so great.
We're so proud of you, honey.
Our little Einstein ready to take on the world.
So, factoring in the speed of light and the curvature of the Earth, and adjusting for intermorphic theory of space‐time, you have eight hours to write the whole term paper.
Good, great.
You would've had nine if you'd just taken the clock's word for it, but whatever.
Just start with your name.
And...

‐ ‐One second.
I'm sure you can't relate to the struggles of Susan Hirsch.
After all, you work hard.
You value your time.
You'd never waste your whole night watching a science fiction TV show.
And the dissimilarities don't stop there.
For Susan Hirsch is about to discover a secret so shocking that‐‐well, you'll find out.
All in good... time.
Ta‐da.
You've already finished it?
Well, pending the Sue Hirsch seal of approval, of course.
"Exploring Quantum Paradoxes" by Alex Kapur.
‐lt's cute.

So, when do I get to see yours?
See my what?
Um, your paper.
What'd you end up writing about?
Oh, you know, sciency physics stuff.
Oh, my God, you haven't started yet.
I've started thinking about it.
It's due at midnight!
But, you know, by the time he actually gets around to reading, it'll be like 12:30, so‐‐
‐Sue, if you don't finish‐‐ ‐I'm gonna finish it.
When?
Tell you what... if someone from the future invents
‐time travel‐‐ ‐Mm‐hmm.
‐‐I will go back in time and place my paper right here.
You know in order for that to actually work, you have to write the paper first, right?
You know you've got the wrong equation for closed timeline curves, right?
Shut up, don't change the subject, okay?
'Cause this is about‐‐ what did you just say?
That's Deutsch's model.
What you want is Lloyd's.
Like the "who" versus "whom" of timeline equations.
Oh, my God.
Why did I take theoretical physics?
Okay, maybe this will help.
Remember that episode of Time Ryder where they're stuck in ancient Rome?
Season two, "Time, Time Again."
Season two of what now?
"Time Ryder and the Crono Teens."
What is that, like a cartoon or something?
You don't remember "Time Ryder" from the '90s?
Sundial Cartoons?
Must be drawing a blank.
I get it, someone's zapped the memo eraser around you, very funny.
Huh?
Time Ryder uses the memo eraser to erase people's memories...
You know what, we are watching an episode right now.
What about the paper?
Just one episode, I promise.
It'll be a night you remember for the rest of your life.
Oh, boy.
Okay, so it's like Wishbone meets Captain Planet but way cooler than‐‐
Huh.
What is that smell?
I don't‐‐ I don't know, maybe you're having a stroke.
So, anyway, Time Ryder is captain of the Crono Squad.
They defend Earth's timeline, so every week he and the Crono Teens...
Must've taken it down again.
Wait...

No, that's impossible.
Well, maybe you spelled it wrong.
That's also impossible.
I was just watching an episode and then you rang, and I stepped on a...
Oh, my God.
Any luck down there, Alex?
Not yet.
Uh, hey, don't you have like a friend from high school you could ask?
Friend from high school, that's a good one.
Come on, you don't have one friend that you grew up with?
Of course.
Hi, honey.
Hey, Mom!
Silly question, but you remember "Time Ryder," right?
Sorry, Time what now?
Time Ryder.
Is that a cartoon or something?
Are you kidding?
I watched the cartoons every day after school.
You bought me the toys every Hanukkah.
Well, put some on your list this year, and we'll see what Jewish Santa can do.
She doesn't remember it either.
It's like the show never even existed.
Alex, do you think I'm crazy?
Um...
Maybe you're just having, like, a panic attack.
Sue, please don't do this.
No time to argue, it's a four‐hour bike ride to Sundial Cartoons.
They'll have scripts, they'll have sound,
‐they'll have‐‐ ‐They'll be closed, Sue.
Then I'll peak through the window.
Even if you're right, you're throwing your future away for a cartoon.
It's not real, Sue.
Time Ryder is not real.
History needs your help.
Time Ryder!
I come from the future.
No, a future.
A future where mankind has reached its full potential.
A future in peril because there's something that happens here tonight.
Something that changes the course of history.
I have traveled to this locus of space and time on a desperate mission to stop it.
So I ask you... in the name of the future of humankind have you kids seen any weird shit going on tonight?
Okay, uh, one second, guy.
Sue, we gotta call the cops.
This dude is nuts.
No, he's not, he's Time Ryder.
Haven't you been listening?
He's in a turquoise motorcycle outfit.
Listen, there can't be a Time Ryder.
You said it yourself, Time Ryder's a cartoon.
Yeah, and he's sitting right in front of us.
Oh, well, that's the coolest shit I've ever seen in my life.
Please continue.
You're right, smart guy.
Time Ryder is a cartoon.
One that inspires an entire generation of young minds to pursue science, including the inventor of time travel.
I told you it was a really good show.
Well, we try.
Wait a second, that's it.
Somehow the entire show is disappearing from existence.
No one remembers it, even my toys have disappeared.
My God.
That show is the most important piece of children's entertainment in the universe.
It's the foundation on which my future was built.
And if it disappears...
My future's history.
Whoa.
We need to go back.
To the moment this all began.
And we need to find out who... or what is erasing that show and stop it.
But I'll need your help.
Are you with me, Crono Teens?
I'm 23.
Then raise your right hand.
Okay.
Do you vow to preserve the past?
‐We vow.

Do you swear to defend the future?
‐We swear.

Do you have any homework due tomorrow?
Mmm, give me one second.
Sue, you've gotta finish your paper.
Um, he has a time machine, duh.
‐We're good.

In that case...

‐lt goes on top.

Are you ready to ride the timeline, kids?
Yeah!
Let's ride.
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
Oh, yes.
Is it over?
Mm, this never gets old.
One second.
Okay.
These Invisibracelets are linked to the ROYGBIV scrambalizer on my Crono Gauntlet.
As long as you wear them, no one from the past can see you or hear you.
This is so cool.
Okay, Alex, here we go.
Ta‐da!
No, no, that's too much crotch.
Uh...

Why, why Jazz hands?
What am I doing?
All right, uh...

Yeah.
You got a fast‐forward button on that thing?
Oh, I am rank.
Ta‐da!
You've already finished it.
Let's just, uh...

You know, by the time he actually gets around to reading it, it'll be like 12:30, so‐‐
Sue, if you don't finish it‐‐
I'm gonna finish it.
When?
Okay, tell you what, if someone from the future invents time travel...
We're in, keep your eyes open for any anomalies.
Look, my toys.
I thought you said they disappeared.
They will, but they haven't yet.
This isn't the past, it's the past of your past.
Could this be any more confusing?
It's our past before our timeline's changed.
Does that mean...
Okay, you remember that episode of "Time Ryder"
where they get stuck in ancient Rome?
Really, another Time Ryder story?
Okay, let's go down this rabbit hole again.
You remember the show.
I don't remember remembering the show.
‐Season two‐‐ ‐lt's like you really did get hit with a memo eraser.
That's impossible.
The only memo eraser on active service is right...
Looking for this?
Entropy.
I've waited a long time for this.
But in some ways it's been no time at all.
Prepare yourself Time Ryder.
It looks like time is about to ride you!
Hey, asshole.
‐Huh?

Oh!
Okay, first of all, I knew I wasn't the stinky one.
And second of all, who or what the hell was that?
Remember when I told you I come from a future that's great?
‐No.

Anyway, Entropy comes from a future that sucks.
Of course!
Entropy's the one trying to erase our show.
With my memories, damn.
We played right into his trap.
We need to go back again.
Trust me, just one episode.
Come here.
Let's ride.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Entropy could attack anywhere at any time.
There he is.
Oh, I am rank.
Damn.
Why us, why now?
We'll ask him when we catch him.
Got a fast‐forward button on that thing?
Let's keep moving.
Why‐‐why would he do that?
Let's move.
We're in, keep your eyes open for any anomalies.
Oh, there.
My toys...
I thought you said they disappeared.
They will, but they haven't yet, this isn't your past, it's the past of your past.
Can this be any more confusing?
Sure can, buddy.
Entropy should reappear to steal my memo eraser
‐in T minus‐‐ ‐Oh, there he is.
He stole the memo thing.
Damn!
Tracking his signature.
He's coming back around.
The only memo eraser in active service is right...
Looking for this?
Got him.
Hey, asshole.
Oh!
Damn, we played right into his trap.
We need to go back again.
Trust me, just one episode.
Come here.
Let's ride!
Okay, and what the hell was that?
Maybe we won.
Maybe Time Ryder got the cuffs on him and he's hauling him off to Time Base One.
Ryder!
What is that smell?
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, my God, is he dead?
He's alive.
Okay, so what‐‐ what do we do?
'Cause, I mean, has anything like this ever happened on the show?
Actually, in episode 304‐‐
Of course.
Oh no.
No, no, no, no, no.
Relax, I've seen this done a million times on the show, it's just... ‐Oh, oops.

Just let me close out of this.
All right.
Oh!
‐ ‐One second.
‐I got it!

It's safer.
Ta‐da!
Oh, no, too much crotch.
Uh, ta‐da‐‐no.
It's jazz hands.
All right.
Ta‐dow.
Ta‐dow!
Oh!
I am rank.
Uh, what?
‐Looking for this?

Ta‐da!
Huh?
Oh!
Entropy, you're under arrest for causality violations in Continuum Sector 818.
Nice moves, Crono Teens.
Thanks for leaving that note.
Wait, we didn't leave a note.
Huh.
Guess I left it for myself.
Not a bad move.
You know, it's against regulations to take a Crono Captain's memo eraser without his consent.
I know, but it was the only way to make sure the Entropy didn't completely erase everything.
It looks like it worked.
Hey...

Including that shitty Christmas special you did.
Huh.
Everyone's a critic, aren't they?
Well, it seems as though the timeline is back on course, and this case is history.
That's it?
Crono Squad thanks you for your service.
No, no, that‐‐ that can't be it.
I mean, what was he doing here?
Why did he coming after us?
I have so many questions.
Of course you do.
You're a scientist, Sue.
But your place is in here now.
Entropy's secrets belong to the future.
Will I ever‐‐ will we ever see you again?
Only time will tell.
Jesus.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to take this... scum back to Time Base One.
Au revoir, Crono Teens.
Let's ride.
Oh, yes!
Yes, yes.
Au revoir.
Ugh.
Well, that was... an interesting way to spend an evening.
Oof.
Uh, so... back to work?
How can you say that?
What?
We just traveled through time.
We were Crono Teens.
We can't just pretend like that didn't happen.
Ryder was right, this is where we belong.
I can't go back to the way things were.
Back‐‐this is the back, Sue.
We are back, and you got a lot of work to do.
You're right.
What are you look‐‐
We do.
Is it happening‐‐oh.
It's Entropy's ring.
The source of all his power.
Great, I‐‐I wonder what it's doing here.
I don't know, but as Crono Teens, it's our duty to pass it off to the right authorities.
Are you kid‐‐
Of course it is.
We should give it back to Time Base One.
It'll be safe there.
I mean, what if it got into the wrong hands?
It already is in the wrong hands.
Don't you wanna see Time Base One?
It's one of the seven wonders of the galaxy, and to set this right?
No!
I don't.
So, if you wanna play time teen, by all means, but‐‐but you're on your own, okay?
Fine, suit yourself.
No, that's the wrong answer.
Sue, Sue, you sit down on this bed, Sue‐‐Sue!
‐Time Base One!

Oh, hey.
Those were on your‐‐
Uh, where are we?
I thought Time Base One was in the future.
I thought so too.
Judging by the freshness of that guy's kicks,
I'd say we were in 1995.
We're in the '90s.
Of course.
Ahem!
Hi.
We're here to see Time Ryder.
Did you have an appointment?
No, but we came to give him this.
What did you say your name was?
Susan Hirsch.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, well, come on in, Miss Hirsch.
Yeah, please.
I'll get this to Captain Ryder right away.
What is going on?
Don't you see, Alex?
Time Base One is Sundial Cartoons.
That's why the show looks just like the future because the show is made by people from the future.
So, this guy right here is from the future?
They all are.
Think about it.
Crono Squad's entire mission is to protect humanity's future, and what better way to do that than by inspiring the children of the past.
Is that who I think it is?
I don't know.
Listen, we saw this place.
Can we please leave?
Hey, future guy.
Nice corduroys.
Yeah.
Mr. Nash?
Uh‐huh?
I‐‐I'm a really big fan of your show.
I actually saw you a while back at CronoCon.
Well, I guess 20 years from now, but um...
I'm rambling.
Can I get you to sign something for me?
‐Name?

Susan Hirsch?
Wally.
Wally Nash.
It's an honor to meet you, young lady.
It is?
Well, of course it is.
You'll have to excuse us if we're all a little star struck.
It's not every day we meet the Mother of Time.
Yeah, that's me.
Mother of Time.
Come on, guys.
Miss Hirsch has some urgent business with Captain Ryder.
Guys, come on.
Okay, what's the problem?
We've been trying to send Lord Snappington here back to Time Jail, but we can't get a signature lock.
Have you compensated for signal interference?
That's just it, the channel's clear, but we can only read Time Jail for a few seconds at a time, almost as if it's‐‐
It's flickering out of existence.
Is that you, Time Ryder?
I know you can hear me.
What have you done?
No, no, no, no, no.
This is Deutsch's model, you want Lloyd's model.
You ever see "Time, Time Again"?
Uh...

Thanks.
When's it due again?
Midnight.
Thank God for time travel.
Right.
Wait, what?
What?
I'm whating your what.
So clarify your what.
You still have enough time to do your paper, right?
Yes, I have a time machine.
Uh‐oh.
Um...
Okay, do you know how time travel works?
Do you know how time‐‐'cause I'm...
I have no idea.
You know what the best part of an eternity in Time Jail was?
I had eternity to think up the perfect plan.
Even though you are in the past right now, your present continues to move forward without you.
Okay.
You wanna graduate?
Then turn something in.
Sorry, I gotta get out of here.
As we learned with the Logan‐Prescott Theory‐‐
I know this, any object traveling through time must return to its own present.
‐Yes.

So even though you are in 1996 right now, and it's 2:45pm.
That means in my own present time it's...
Oh, crap.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I‐‐I have to go.
Sue, Sue.
Logan‐Prescott Theorem.
Don't freak out, but our present is happening
‐without us.

You know?
‐You lied to me?

I just had to see this place.
It was a mistake, it was a big, big mistake.
Do you have any idea what time it is?
Oh no, the paper.
Timeline breach detected.
Entropy, you scum.
Save your anger for the Mother of Time.
She lied to you, Time Ryder.
What are you talking about?
Her homework?
No, she took an oath.
I must've come up with a million ways to exact my revenge.
This one wasn't the best, but it was the most ironic.
It seems you don't need an army or a doomsday weapon to destroy the future, all you need is to give Susan Hirsch what she always wanted... a chance to star in a real‐life
"Time Ryder and the Crono Teens" adventure.
You're forgetting one thing, smart guy.
You're in here.
Who's gonna get you out of that?
Isn't it obvious?
I am.
Hey, Captain.
Susan Hirsch is here.
What, how?
She came to bring you this.
Thank you.
Greetings from the future, Time Ryder.
No!
Thank you.
Damn.
Susan, how could you do this?
I've let you down, I'm sorry.
What's happening?
She didn't do her paper.
She's gonna flunk out of school.
But if she flunks out of school, she won't get into grad school.
She doesn't go to grad school, she'll never invent time travel.
She doesn't invent time travel, the future will never exist, and neither will we.
Okay, let's just all calm down.
Oh, my God, we're all gonna die!
Well, we're still here, which means we still have a chance.
My paper's due at midnight.
It's 11:30, and I haven't even started.
You haven't even started?
Well, I started thinking about it.
But... every time I go to write this stupid paper, it's‐‐ it's hard, and I'm worried I'm gonna be a big failure and let everyone down, so I...

I am not the Mother of Time.
I will never be her.
I'm a failure.
‐No.

Look, the paper's due on his desk at midnight, but he's probably not gonna get to it till 12:30.
So what?
So, if we can stall him, if we can get him out of that office, we can buy Sue time to finish her paper.
Did I get that right?
Is that how time travel works?
'Cause I'm just a plus one here.
Sue's less‐important friend is right.
Yeah‐‐all right.
We can buy you the time.
Can you get the job done?
Of course she can.
She's a Crono Teen.
Yeah, I can do it.
Hello?
Hello?
Okay.
Term paper.
The universe hangs in the balance.
Start with your name.
Your professor.
The date.
First sentence.
Whoever's doing this, it's not funny!
The dean's gonna find out about it.

You can't snap your fingers, asshole.
Then I suppose we will just have to stay like this... forever.
Hey!
Professor Dobkin.
Alex, was that you the whole time?
‐Was what me?

Breathe it in!
You know you dropped some papers back there?
No, I got 'em all right here.
No, I'm pretty sure you dropped more‐‐
Alex.
Ah!
Okay, fine, you know what?
You flunk me, okay?
Because if there's anything I've learned from this adventure it's that‐‐

Let's table this conversation.

Oh, my God, it's so simple.

What happened to Alex?
Man down, Sue.
You can stop writing.
What?
I'm‐‐I'm almost finished.
It's too late.
You need to get out of there.
The Temporo Porter, go.
It's over, Alex is gone.
Timeline collapse imminent.
Get to the platform, I can send you back to your present.
You'll be safe, but you have to hurry.
What about you?
It's too late for me.
In 30 seconds that machine won't exist anymore and you'll be stuck in the past‐‐go.
Okay, I'm inside.
Goodbye, Susan Hirsch.
Goodbye, Susan Hirsch.
Goodbye, Time Ryder.
Paradox detected.
It's not working.
"Paradox detected," what the hell is it talking about?
It's talking about me.
Episode 23.
The problem with paradoxes, in about 30 seconds I'll be a girl who remembers a show that never existed, which makes me a living, breathing paradox.
And you can't return to the present until the paradox is resolved.
How do I resolve it?
No.
No, no, that is not an option.
It's your only option.
Then I'll find another one!
Sue, you can stay in the past forever or let me go and face the future on your own.
I can't, I mean, look at me, I'm a mess.
I can't‐‐I can't do this without you.
Of course you can.
And I'll tell you why because you are special.
You can achieve incredible things.
And the greatest power in the universe is right between your ears.
You don't need me anymore.

So, when do I get to see yours?
See my what?
Um, your paper.
What did you end up writing about?
Uh, you know, sciency physics stuff.
You haven't started yet?
Okay, don't panic.
