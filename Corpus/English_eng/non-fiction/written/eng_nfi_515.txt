I was hoping you summoned me because there was a sale on capes.
This called for more supernatural mall cop.
And I thought Black Friday was a shopper's nightmare.
Sick 'em, Audrey!
Shop till they drop, Zatanna.
Maybe time to summon your friend, Jason.
Gone, gone, form of man.
Arise, the demon Etrigan!
These dummies can't take a hint!
My hat!
A perfect fit.
Ta-ta.
Was that...
Felix Faust.
It appears this entire attack was begat in order to acquire your magic hat.
My hat's a mystic portal, a gateway to other dimensions.
What would Faust want from another dimension?
From lowest depths, beyond all sight,
- come forth, vile beast, to spread your fright... - ...to sting with tail and rend with tooth, once your freedom bringeth back my...
What?
Not quite the vile beast I was envisioning.
Shoo!

Where was I?
Okay, ah yes, um.
Your freedom bringeth back my...
Scram!

Rodents, running around, coming out of hats...
My BPS.
Bunny Positional System.

The Hebrides islands of Scotland.
We'll find my hat there.
We're running out of time.

Say no more.
Merlin!
Merlin!
Why do you disturb me, impish rival?
From this place where we have fought, transport us now to the land of Scot!
Very well.
Now bother me no more.
Come forth, vile beast, to spread your fright,
- to sting with tail and rend with...

Once your freedom bringeth back my youth!
Oh, great and powerful Ghast.
As promised, I have set you free!
Now, grant me my reward!
Uh, please?
Hmm.
Ah.
Has my madness unleashed doom upon this world?
Totally worth it!
Feel great, feel good.
Here we go, get my books, get out of here.
- Faust!

Give it back.
You mean this?

Ha, ha.

If that's how it has to be.
Ah, ah, ah!
Oh, how cute.

Hey, look, I've got a trick too.

Levitating.

How does he do it?

Argh.
Yonder town is this thing's aim.

Time to do some pest control.
What have we learned?

Ahh.
A squirt bottle.

Huh?
Ugh.
- At last.

Ugh, ugh...
- Uh.

Backwards.

Huh?
Together, we are a team of thunder.

Get ready to jump.
No worse for wear.
Ugh.
Why did it have to be rabbits?
