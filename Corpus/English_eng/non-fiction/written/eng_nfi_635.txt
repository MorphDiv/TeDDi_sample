[man on PA, indistinct] [door buzzing] [chattering] [man exhales]
[man 2] So what do you think, Joe?
[scoffs]
I don't know.
I don't think that's for me to say.
A second chance?
I mean, it's a nice idea, but...
But?
- How do you feel?

I feel that I was a nightmare.
I made terrible choices.
I drove my family away.

I hurt people.
I didn't mean to, but there it is.
And for all that... there's a hole inside me now.
It hurts.

Like Phil Coakley hurts?
Of course not.
But I know the work I've done.

Yeah.
- Yeah.

I got almost six years.
That's real.
That's clarity.
I can't do anything about before.

But I can show people I've changed.
Like with my behavior.
And my girls.
I can be their father again.
And that's what you want?
That's all there is.
A second chance.
Why not?
I have faith in you, Joe.
- Thank you, Morris.

Would you like to take communion before you go?
Oh, no.

[cabdriver] Yeah.
- [Joe] Keep the change.

[man] Mother's got her soup line today late.
I think we expected to see you next week.
- Ah, she'd have meant to be here.

Well, she'd have meant to be here.
- [Joe] Wait.

Retired, huh?
Yeah.

Look, uh, you know, such a long trip up there and my back being what it is.
- I know.

- I just, uh...

[chopping]
They brought some of your stuff back when they closed your apartment.
It's downstairs in your space if you wanna...
Sure.
Hmm.
Oh, no.
[dialing]
Hey, baby.
I missed you too.
[automated voice] The number you've reached is not in service...
- [Joe] Where'd they move to?

We haven't spoken to Elaine since you went up.
[Joe] What about the girls?

We are not in touch anymore.
- You never called?

Well, she's not obligated to.
The settlement was clear...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

A clean break now, Joe, while the girls are young.
It's a shame, but maybe she's right.
Can I borrow the truck?
- Your mother will be home...

I've been indoors six years.

[engine starts]
[coins clinking] [beeping]
[line ringing] [girl] Hello?
Melissa?
Yeah?
It's Daddy, sweetie.
It's your dad.
My dad?
Uh-huh.
How are you, baby?
Hmm.

How's your sister?
She's okay.
That's great.
Um, you know, I...
I've been away because...

It wasn't my fault.
Well, it was, but I was sick and...
But now... now I'm better, see, and we...
Can you hold on?
Melissa.

[woman] Joe?
Hey, sweetie.
How did you get this number?
I know.

Joe, you know that's not allowed.
- I should be able to speak to my...

You're violating your agreement.
Agreement?
- You call again...

I'll press charges.
Well, this is...
Joe's such a bad boy.
- [man] Sucker.

[jukebox:

[pool balls clacking]
[exhales]
Ahhh.
[whistles, laughs]
Joe motherfuckin' Denton.
- Shit.

Goddamn.

Uh, get one, and put that on mine.
- That's kind of you, man.

It's the least I can do, man.
I figure you and Billy were...

- Hey.

And to my brother Billy.
To home and to Billy.
I...

If you need anything...
- Thanks, man.

You know, I come in here a lot, and I'm pretty sure I've never seen you before.
I'm new.
- New used, maybe.

But it's what's under the hood that counts.
- Yep.

Not the paint job.

I get it.

Enjoyable.
Do you, uh... wanna buy me a Sucker Punch?
Oh, boy.
I don't know what that is.
Drinks.
[Joe exhales] [woman] Hey!
[Joe] Hey.
- [woman] Now what?

No.

No, I, uh...

- [woman scoffs]

Are you sure?
Yeah.
That's boring.

Please.
Pretty please?
Pretty, pretty please?
[Joe] You sure this is the right way?
Yeah.

[radio:

It's right over there.
[man] ♪ Why'd you go away?

♪ I told you I'd get clean, girl ♪
Okay.
You know...
- [keys jangling] - [engine stops]
I thought you were gonna try something with me.
- I'm just giving you a lift.

[sighs]
You didn't ask my name.
What's your name?
- [thunder rumbling]

[groans]
Cara Coakley, you motherfucker.
Help!

[man yelling, groaning]
[air conditioner whirring] [sighs]
Coffee?
I'd say it's good to see you again, but I feel sick just being this close.
- Nice to see you too, Dan.

Don't you dare use the informal with me, you fucking degenerate.
You're an everlasting disgrace to this department, and if Officer Barnett wasn't here,
I would tune you up myself on general principle.
Let me ask you something.
Did Manny Vassey or any of his animals visit you inside?
Was it worth it, selling your soul to them?
You Judas fuck.
Where's the DA?
Isn't he coming?
[door closes]
[Joe grunts]
Look, Phil, this is not how I want...
One of those young men is in intensive care.
The one with the nunchakus?
His father is an alderman.
I don't give a shit if they're astronauts.
Charge me.
Put those assholes on the stand and watch 'em come apart like wet bread, because you know exactly what this is.
They're parked in the middle of nowhere with ninja weapons, precisely where and when their girlfriend happens to get assaulted?
Come on.

Now, your daughter built herself a cute little frame, but there's no way this ends in anything but a civil suit that buys me your fucking house.
[Phil] You're right.
I spoke with Cara just now.
She's, uh, quite shaken by what happened.
She's been, uh, angry lately.
She, uh...
Do you wish to press charges?
In light of the statement given by my...
Cara, regarding the events of this evening... you have the right to press criminal battery charges against the men who attacked you,
- and my office will issue arrest warrants.

Ah, forget it.
It's in the past.
Phil.
If I could change what happened, I would.
But I paid my time.
I just want everything to stay in the past.
Like you want Billy Caldwell to stay in the past?
You're batting zero, shithead.
[door closes]
Goddamn, I miss high school.
I just passed a kid in the lot molesting his girlfriend in the backseat of his '82 Datsun.
Kind of impressed that Phil's kid went for hard stuff like that.
She always seemed like kind of a flake to me.
But then the mother did leave after the, uh... [whooshing]
So that's gotta be kind of rough.
You look like you lost a little weight.

What's up, Dan?
How's that for manners after all I've done for you?
- [chuckles]

Six years in county beats 12 years in the state house.
Those boys down there would've spread you out like my crazy aunt's quilt.
Yeah, that was Manny's grease, not yours.
- Speaking of the king...

- I didn't ask for this.

Uh-huh.
You heard about Manny?
What?
Cancer.
In the butt.

Well, he had a good run.

Nothin' to do with me.
- Clean slate, huh?

Well, I hate to break it to you, but you're on the hook here, Joey.
Manny's gotta go.
You...
You said cancer.
Before then.

Fuck are you talking about?
That old-time religion.
Old man's found God.
Cravin' salvation by way of confession.
Bullshit.

Old Manny wouldn't, but dying's made him smaller.
So let's consider now specifically the kinds of things that he might confess to.
Say, vis-à-vis, you.
Yeah.
Now you're seein' it.
You think Phil's comment about Bill Caldwell was coincidental?
- Manny's talking to Phil?

First he wants Phil hit, then his asshole's melting and he wants to give him absolution.
Christ forgives.

Phil's nudging him towards a deposition, and if he lives long enough, a grand jury.
But even if not, you'd be inside so fast, your bunk would still be warm.
And no favors this time.
What do we do?
"We"?

You know, Phil's been trying to butt-fuck you since forever, and if Manny sings, he can do it.
And if you do get keistered, I'd worry I'm next in line, and let me tell you what ain't gonna happen.
If I was gonna roll over, wouldn't I do that before serving my fucking time?
- I did the job they wanted...

- Fuck you.

[chuckles]
You be sure and send her some flowers now, son.
The point is, you left Phil breathing all those years ago, or it wouldn't be a problem now.
The way I see it, it's your mess.
But hey, I'm more into carrots than sticks, so... let's talk about your girls instead.
Junior high by now, hmm?
Family court judge by the name of Winthrop found himself "over-served" one evening a while back.
And he dented up the front of his Prius with the skull of an address-free citizen.
You might say I helped him sweep that up.
And I know that he would fall all over himself doing me a favor in return.
Like revising your custody deal, for instance, so you can see your daughters again.
What am I thinking?

Manny goes.

The stick?

Do it fast.
Answer me on that if I call.
- Don't make me come after you.

[insect buzzing]
[man on TV:

He lives.
Hi, Mom.
Oh, I guess you needed the rest.

- Is that a bruise?

That was there already.

- You need a hand?

[Joe groans] Hard time sleeping.
- Well, this is a big adjustment.

Give it time.
I'm sorry I wasn't here when you arrived.

- I, uh...

- Got our wires crossed, I guess.

- What are your...

- Sorry.

I was just wondering what are your plans for work.
[Joe] I haven't been home a day yet.
It's a reasonable question.
Your first night home and you're out till dawn with your father's truck.
I just don't want things going back to how they were.
Not here.
Dad says you don't speak to your grandchildren.
[Joe's mom] That's Elaine's decision.
We just want what's best for them.
What about me?
It's impossible to you that I might have changed?
You know... every Sunday in church...
I have to see Phil Coakley.
And everybody there sees me seeing him.
Have you ever thought what that might feel like... to me?
Have you changed?
[Joe sighs]
You know what this is?
You expect me to be impressed 'cause you didn't drink in jail?
Dad!

Look, see, this is complicated.
No, it's not.
You say you've changed.

I've prayed for it long enough.
I'm happy you're home, and I love you, but you don't get extra points for doing what's simply required, what everybody else does.
- I can't believe this shit.

[door opens, closes]
[door opens]
[keys jangle] [door closes]
[engine stops]
I am profoundly sorry, Phil.
Bill Caldwell.

And I just wish he'd... he'd... worked the steps.
[ringing]
Hi, Phil.
I was out of line, the way I spoke to you last night.
I thought about this a lot, what I wanted to say to you when I finally saw you, and that wasn't it.
What I did wanna say was that I am profoundly sorry.
I was truly in fear for my life.
I felt I was defending myself, but that doesn't excuse the...
I don't even remember it.

- Which is it?

You were in fear for your life or you don't remember.
Which is it?
The point is, I do take responsibility, and I'm ready to move ahead with a... with a clean life, a good life.
Take responsibility and just...
You know.

You mentioned Bill Caldwell.
He was my friend.
I loved him.
I just wish he'd gotten into the program like I have, worked the steps.
There's a whole other world you can live in.
He just didn't know.
You are within 100 yards of my home here.
But I'm not interested in some chickenshit restraining order violation.
For you, I want the needle.
- And I'm gonna get it.

Okay.
"Anger eats the vessel."
[engine starts]
[man] I guess you heard, huh?
How's he doing?
Can I, um...?
He took care of me in there.
- [monitor beeping] - [mutters]
Hey, Manny.
[Manny] Ha.
You're on the same drugs as me.
- How you feeling?

I'm working on my anger.
[snickers]
- What?

That's not something I thought I'd ever hear you say.
[chuckles] What'd it ever get me?
All this.

Yeah, well, I don't want 'em anymore.
Dan gave me a bag.
- You did your bid.

But I blew the job.
And I warned you about the drinking and the drugs.
You did.
I should've listened, but since I didn't...
I guess I was expecting someone to clip me in there,
- not pay me when I came out.

If you knew how much it cost to sell that imperfect self-defense line.

Manny, come on.
Yeah, I admit.
I was angry about Phil.
You blew our clean shot at him.
Hmm.
But since you'd already taken care of Billy... even though he went over to them... he was your boy.
So that meant something.
I bet Junior disagreed, huh?
Yeah, well, Junior has a lot of...
A lot of different ideas about a lot of things.
Funny you mention talking to Phil.
- Give me that fuckin' thing.

Because what I hear, there's this notion floating now that maybe Billy wasn't an accident.
- There's always talk.

Are you talking to the DA?

You know, sometimes when I'm sleeping...
I think I see what hell looks like... and it ain't fire and it ain't devils.
You know what it is?
It's just me.
And I ain't no goddamn stool pigeon.
I'm sorry.
I don't know.

It's been a tough few days, is all.
[Manny] Tough, yeah.
Tough for everybody.
[exhales] [raspy breathing]
[snoring] [monitor beeping]
[muffled coughing] [doorknob rattles] [muffled coughing continues]
[Joe] He nodded out.

It's the pain.

[snoring]
We should probably let him rest.
Of course.

I'm Joe.
Charlotte Boyd.
Old friend.
So how is he...

I'm a hospice worker.
Yeah, well, he's a fighter.
Charlotte?
Thank you for taking care of my friend.
You're gonna sit there with your stupid fuckin' shirt and tell me I can't see my own father?
My kids can't go?
He just wants you to call first, Junior, that's all.
Oh, I see.
Did this cocksucker call first?
Hey, Junior.
- [boy] I thought we were gonna see Poppy.

[Junior] Go inside and play the quiet game, okay?
Oh, man.

[Junior] Hey, close that door behind you.

- Goddamn, they grow so fast.

[groaning]
Now, you lay there with your hands on your scrotum and you listen.
You are not welcome here.
This is a family time, and this family no longer has any use for dumb-fuck, grief-causing policemen.
Now, you come around here again bothering my father, disturbing his rest... and I'm gonna bring you down to my playroom.
Yeah.

- All right.

I think we'd all feel better if you moved on.
Hey, Junior?
Any idea what Phil Coakley talks to your dad about?
Besides the Bible, I mean.
Now, why would you say something like that?
I mean, all these years my father carries your crazy ass, you're implying he's some kind of rat or something?
All right.

[man shouting in foreign language] [shouting continues]
[whistling]
Hi.
Uh, can I have a coffee, please?
Thank you.
Hello.
Oh, hi.
Here.
Thank you.
No, thank you for taking care of my friend.
You said that already.
Hmm.
Are you from Bradley originally?
I moved from Montreal around two years ago.
- You got family?

I...

Do you work there every day at Manny's house?
- Six days a week usually.

And all of his...

Uh, medication and monitoring and all that, that's all you?
That's me.
And another girl.

Wow.

I guess it is.

No?
But I'm good at helping people.
I guess your agency provides you with supplies and medication and whatnot for there at the house.
My father had lymphoma.
And... [sighs]
They had him on so much different stuff there.
At the end... he didn't know what day it was.
- I'm sorry.

Actually, I just moved back here myself.
Everyone's gone now.
I was, uh, doing some consulting...
- [spits]

[Charlotte] Oh!
- What the fuck?

And you, sir, are a worthless goddamn punk.
[spits]
Ooh.
I think I'm gonna skip this one.
Do you think you might wanna get together again?
Like I said, everyone's gone now, and...
I like you.
[men] Whoo!
You know, if you want, I could set you up with Toni.
Little, uh, welcome-home toss?
You know we take care of cops here.
Bring that pussy over here, girl.

Hell, your old buddy, he's on a weekly.
[man] Come on.

Bruno.

All right, come on.
Get the fuck out.
- Who's the peacock?

They got this whole jealousy thing going.
Anyway, if you wanna spend some time with Toni, it's on me.
- Pass.

Hey, you want any, uh...?

Oh, no, thanks.
[snorting]
Whooooo!
Oh, yeah.
[snorts]
Yeah.
[man on TV] Marion Barry tonight delegated many of his duties as mayor of the nation's capital but did not resign.
The word of this came hours after the DC mayor was brought before a federal magistrate... [door opens, closes]
Excuse me.
That is not your vehicle.
Oh, Dad...

Where have you been all day?

[scoffs] [sighs]
For your information, I went to a meeting.
- Where?

Where was the meeting you were at?
I...

We're not gonna do things like this.

- I'm doing everything I can!

I wish I could believe you, Joe, but you make it so hard.
No.

I said "believe," not "believe in."
- [Joe] See?

The onus is on you.
What difference does it make when you're determined to judge me?
Could I have some support here, please?
Oh, no, wait, wait.

Fuck it.

What's that supposed to mean?
This behavior is precisely why you lost your family, Joseph!
[birds chirping]
[no audible dialogue]
[no audible dialogue]
Ahhh.
Mmm.
- Would you like another one?

What?
Thank you.
For asking me here.
I don't usually...

Feels nice.
Like I said, I like you.
Me too.
So, Montreal.
What prompted the move south?
Polarity.
[clears throat] Weather systems.
- Why does anyone do anything?

Do you ever feel like you're living in the wrong skin?
Sometimes I'll wake up in the middle of the night and I'll go to get a glass of water, and I'll just catch myself in the mirror, and I don't recognize myself at all.
It's like someone else has come into my bathroom and just stood there.
Does that ever happen to you?
Sure.
Hmm.
- [salsa playing]

Oh, yeah.
[man singing in Spanish]
[cat mewing]
I... [clears throat] I'm just gonna go...
Do you...

Okay.

Yes.
Just...
Okay.
[cat mewing] [purring]
[thump]
I like your place.
It's what I have.
- Cheers.

Why me?
'Cause you're good.
[Joe] I think everything happens for a reason, you know?
Like what?
Meeting you.
- [chuckles]

I've been having kind of a hard time.
Just alone, you know?
Things... just f-feel different now.
- Hmm.

[sighs] Anyways, so, yeah.
Do you have any other clients?
Other than Manny, I mean.
I noticed you had, I don't know, looked like, uh...
- [sighs] - pharmaceuticals or something in there.
The reason I ask is because, before I moved back, one of the firms I was consulting for had this guy...
Oh, Joe.
No, it's true.

Really? "Consulting"?
You were in jail.
It was in the paper.
Your picture was in the paper.
"Slash Cop," it said, which just is...
What happened?
[sighs] Didn't you read it?
I'm asking you.
I was very drunk.

Coming home from a place downtown.
Apparently I bumped into him, the lawyer.
And, uh...
There was a fight, and I hurt him.

- It said you had a knife.

It was dark, and I-I-I, um...
If you knew...
Because I know what it means to need a second chance.
And I didn't know you when you did those things.
I know you now.
[cell phone buzzing] [buzzing continues]
- [phone beeps]

[Dan on phone] Didn't wake your girl, did I?
I was hoping I would've heard some sort of "In Memoriam" item by now about our mutual patron.
I fucking tried.

- Whoa.

I can't get that close again.
If anything other than cancer happens to Manny,
I'll be the first one he comes after.
Figure it out. [Exhales]
Put in some work instead of gettin' your dick wet.
I was working.

- Oh.

- Why not?

There's no access.

[sighs] All that matters is that there isn't a case brought against you.
Phil is the only one eager to throw bombs, and everybody else knows that the Vasseys are good for business.
So if you can't clip Manny, clip the mutant.
There's no time left.

[thunder rumbling]
[soft footsteps approaching]
- [grunts] - [hammer cocks]
[Phil inhales]
[Phil exhales]
[phone ringing]
[Joe's mom] Joe!

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

You have your office check-in and urinalysis appointment today.
- [sniffs]

Yes, sir.

Fuck.
[buttons clicking] [line ringing]
- [Scotty] Hello?

- I need your help.

Joe.
- Oh, hey, man.

[Scotty] Seriously, Joe, it's no problem.
Positive?
The, uh, reserves piss test randomly, so I, uh... stick to booze.
- You can keep the cup. [Chuckles] - [chuckling]
- Thanks, man.

[sighs]
Hey, Joe, can I ask you something straight up?
Sure.
Back then was there ever any, uh...
I don't know...
Any talk about what happened to Billy maybe wasn't an accident?
I mean, we all know he was a lush, but falling asleep on the tracks?
Wasn't my case, but I knew the guys who drew it.

Why, um...
Why now?
Phil Coakley called me.

Mm-hmm.

He said they're gonna impanel a grand jury and, uh, reopen it as a homicide.
Based on what?
"New information" is all he would say.
It's like he wanted to dangle it in front of my face.
Fuckin' prick.
Whatever Phil says he's got, it's smoke.

He's got a hard-on for the Vasseys.

There was talk about Junior, maybe he'd been around the tracks that night.
But they could never back it up.

A shitty accident, like you said.
I'm sorry, man.
I never liked Phil anyway.
I was glad when you fucked him up.
Thanks, man.

Hey, buddy.
- [electricity zapping] - [groans]
- Hey, fellas!

[Joe groans]
Yeah, now he gets it.
[grunts]
Get it all out.
- Okay.

Up you go.

This thing works pretty good, huh?
Now, I didn't wake up in this mood.
I was thinking, "Don't worry.

But then I hear, uh, no.
This Caldwell grand jury is, uh, in motion after all.
- I know.

Did I tell you what was coming?

I'll just take my chances in court.
Buddy, you know I wouldn't be able to let you do that.
Then I'll run.
Well, that either.

F-Fu...

You name a third way or get the fuck out.
I just bought a new gas grill.
Stainless steel.

To be honest, I don't even know what that means.
But if you think that I wouldn't buy some crackhead nigger for 500 bucks to come into your parents' house and slit their throat while they sleep... if it meant that I got to keep that grill, you got me mixed up with somebody else.
Manny's deposition is Monday morning.
Thirty-six hours.
Now, you fix it before then, or I'll assume that we're at odds.
And then... [huffs] goddamn, everything's on the table.
And I really do like your folks.
[engine cranks] [phone ringing] [phone beeps]
Kelley's.
[Joe] Hey, it's me.
Do you know, I was thinking maybe I'd want to talk to Toni.
- You mentioned preferentials.

So you know when she sees Dan then?
Or...

Dan?

I was talking about Phil Coakley.
How else do you think that Frankenstein motherfucker's getting any pussy?
[siren blaring]
[Joe] Where'd you meet him?
[Toni] English Garden Inn, off 68.
Same room or different room?
He had a retainer on number 27, on account of it's a queen size.
- Can you get him to see you again?

A grand.
Thousand dollars?
Cash.

[scoffs]
[Joe] I think I can do it.
[Dan on phone] Good boy.

Neither.
I got a way to freeze Phil out.

Oh, girl, did I knock a fuse loose?
I can back him off.

You must have a hell of a wedge.
- [car horn honks] - [sighs]
Bradley's most saintly public official.

Ha!

I'm looking at it.
I'll be goddamned.
Phil's still got some gas in his tank after all.
He is mighty precious about his reputation, but, still, blackmail's messy, you ain't careful.
Nobody dies, Dan.

So long as it's chilled.
It will be.
[engine starts]
That's my boy.
[humming]
Thanks.
[humming]
You seem different.
How's that?
I don't know.
Lighter.
Mmm.
Things are gonna work out.
Maybe they already have.
[cat mews]
I'm gonna have a shower.
All right.
[chuckles]
[phone buzzes]
[beeps]
Yeah?
[Toni] I told him I'd see him again if he laid off the Jesus.
He damn near jumped through the phone.
Great.

[door opening]
Joe.
I gotta talk to you.
All right.
[grunts, exhales]
I read this while you were inside.
I didn't know there was a name for it.
I have always known since you were little... there was something in you.
And I didn't do anything about it.
I've done a lot of soul-searching... about my part in what happened to you.
- Dad, you didn't do anything.

That's what I'm saying.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't make you run with wild people.
I didn't make you gamble all that money.
I didn't make you take drugs or drink liquor or be so goddamn angry all the time, Joe.
I knew how you were.

I am sorry, Joe.
For that I am truly sorry.
But I've gotta do something about it now.
For your mother, for me...
- [sighs] - maybe for you.
I don't know.
But this cannot continue.
Give me the keys.
Dad...
Give me the keys.
Tomorrow morning.
You're gonna have to leave.
Dad, I'm leaving right now.
Joe?
[door opening]
Where is it?
I will not have dirty money in my house.
It's not dirty money.

Who keeps that much money in a bag unless it's dirty money?
You have no right to go through my stuff!
We have every right!
Where did it come from?

What's the difference?

My wish is to have my son back.
- All right...

- [Joe's dad] Take it easy, Joe.

I'm going.

But I need that bag.
- Mm-mmm.

So where is it?

Please.
No.

No!
[Joe] What the fuck?
[sobs]
You... have been in touch this whole time?
The best thing that ever happened to those girls was to get away from their father.
[shouts]
[Joe's mom] Remember, you had everything and you destroyed it all!
- [Joe] Fuck you!

[Joe] You'll never hate me as much as I hate myself!
[Joe's mom] Oh, no, you don't!
You don't get to turn this into a little pity party!
This is beyond your little feelings!
[Joe] When did you ever care how I felt?
[Joe's mom] That's all I ever cared about!

I hate what you've done to this family!
- Where's the fucking money?

- [rapid gunfire] - [screaming]
[distorted] Joe!

- [Joe's mom] Oh!

- [speaks indistinctly] - [gagging, gasping]
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Joe!

Dad?
Dad?
Who did it?
[Joe sighs]
Junior Vassey or-or Dan Pleasant.

Your friends.
[Joe] Oh.
You bring mayhem with you, Joe.
[knocking]
I fucked up.
[water splashes]
[Joe] Then what happened was...
I got behind with my bookie.
It started slow, ya know, couple of Sundays of bad luck.
Next thing I know, I'm underwater.
I kept thinking, "Aw, I'll sort this out."
[sniffs] "I'll dig out from this.
My daughters... when they look at me, when they look at my face, they'll forgive me."
Me and another cop... a guy named Dan... we did whatever Manny said, and he said, "Do terrible things."
Now it...
It's happening all over again.
He's gonna talk about all that now, Manny is, and when he does... that prosecutor's gonna give me the death penalty.
[sniffs] Assuming Dan doesn't kill me first.
You don't know that.
You don't.
We're not defined by our pasts.
You've remade yourself.

It's a choice.

In prison, uh, there was a chaplain.
Chaplain Morris.
And he sat with me for...

I'm tellin' ya, if someone tells you for that long that you can be forgiven...
You're the only one who made me feel like maybe he was right.
He was.
I need money to run.

- Let's go.

[zipper zips]
[Joe] I'm gonna go.
Big time.
But... you're gonna see the playroom first.
Junior, you don't have to do this.

What-Whatever Phil is gonna do with your Dad had...
My dad?
My father... is dead.
He was a great man.

And...
Well, they'll never be another one like him, right, fellas?
- Fuck yeah.

Your girlfriend isn't the most competent nurse I've ever seen.
[screams] [whimpering]
Jesus Christ, you sound like she did.

But don't worry.

[laughing] [thugs laughing]
[Joe] Where is she?
Out there.
[thug] Let's go. [Speaks foreign language]
[Junior] We're gonna go in there together, you and me.
[Joe groans]
We are gonna go down there and work it all out.
[Junior] We got all day, don't we?
There's nothing to work out.

I didn't do anything.

That's not what she said.
[Joe] We don't have to do this.

- All right, come on.

- [thug speaks foreign language]

No, no, no, no, no!

- [tires screeching]

Who the fuck is this?
[thugs speaking foreign language] [thugs speaking foreign language]

[Scotty] I'll kill you, Junior!
[gunshots] [shotgun cocks]
[shouts]
[Scotty] Die, motherfucker!
- [shouting] - [Scotty shouting] [gunfire]
[Scotty] I see you, Junior!

[both grunting]
[Scotty laughs] There you go, Junior!

[Scotty] Get some!
Get some!
Now, Bill is my brother!
[Junior] Suck my cock, you fuckin' retard!
- [grunting] - [keys jangling]
Fuck it.
[screaming] [grunts]
[Scotty cackling]
[Scotty] Fuck, man.
[Scotty] Joe?
Hey, Joe.
[coughing]
[door rattling] [flies buzzing]
[Joe] You hold on, okay?

Scotty, you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.
Good.
You're gonna be fine.
- Getting you help.

'Cause... you were like a brother to Billy.
That makes you like a brother to me, right?
That's right.
Except he didn't fall on any fucking train tracks, did he?
Not the way they said.
You... put him there.
That's crazy, Scotty.

We're almost there, okay?
Junior... told you to do it.
[clears throat]
And you did it.
I talked to Phil about it, you know?
- He's not such a bad guy.

Did you maybe take a shot at my house, Scotty?
Yeah.
Sorry.
[engine revving]
[thumping] [keys jangling]
[thumping continues]
[Joe grunts] [gasping]
[gurgles] [phone buzzing] [buzzing continues]
- [beeps]

You slick motherfucker, you.
Hey, Dan.
Thought you said your plan was "no bodies."
But I ain't complaining'.

His what?
Phil's car.
[tires squealing]
- Bitch, I knew it!

Motherfucker.
[tires screeching, horn blaring]
[Dan] Got into a smashup last night.

You did it.

Now we'll get started with the judge, get your girls back.
Yes, sir, a brand-new day, Joey.

[phone clicks]
[sighs] [footsteps approaching]
How is she?
She's gonna live.
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.
What are you doing with that?
- You want it?

- What are you doing with it?

- No, you're not.

Just gonna give it to 'em.
Most of it.
[sighs] See them once more, and then I'll just...
No, you're not.
You are going nowhere near those girls.
Money, no money, I don't care.
You will never be in proximity enough that your damage and mayhem ever touches them, not even for a second.
I promise this to you, Son.
This will not happen if I am alive.
Bye, Dad.
I'm... sorry for everything.
No, you're not listening.
I said it will not happen.
I said no.
Stop me.
