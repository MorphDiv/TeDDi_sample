(MAN SPEAKING SPANISH)
We swap in parts from Fords Plymouths and Cadillacs.
My grandfather bought it in 1957.
When he died, it passed to my father.
Then my brother, and now to me.
Look at this.
This is an engine from a boat.
- (IN ENGLISH) No way!

Whatever it takes to keep it running.
(IN ENGLISH) This is the Cuban spirit.

Your spirit.
Don't ever lose that.
Dom.

It's your cousin.
He's in trouble.
Come on!
(ENGINE REVVING)
(ALL CHEERING)
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
(IN ENGLISH) You know I can't make a living without my car.
Not my problem, bro.
Dominic Toretto, I heard about you.

Why you hooking' up my cousin's car?
He needed money, I gave it to him.
He can't pay, I take the car.
I just need a few more days.
"Few more days" wasn't part of the deal.
Come on.

You make a deal, you gonna live up to it.
"Gonna" live up to it?
Oh, so you're one of those types.
You take everyone's ride, and then ship it back to the States?
(IN SPANISH)
You should show your people some respect.
(IN ENGLISH) You watch your mouth.
(CHUCKLES)
Now you got a problem.
- I'm gonna keep it about the cars.

I'm really scared.
(IN ENGLISH) You want a car, get it the right way.
How?
Race for it.
I already own it, bro.
Not that car.
Mine.
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)
Dom, his car is the fastest car on the island.
Do you know what he has under that hood?
He knows it doesn't matter what's under a hood.
The only thing that matters is who's behind the wheel.
You think so?
I know so.
Then race his car.
And we ain't racing no quarter-mile, here.
We race the Cuban mile.
Done.
(CROWD CHEERING)
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
I appreciate what you're trying to do, but my car is the slowest car on the island.
Was.
Pull the seats, the doors, the battery...
If it ain't the motor, take it off.
Laughing gas?
Nah, Fed.

You guys are crazy.
What are you doing?
DOM:

Old trick that Buster used to play, in case of emergencies.
You know that's way too much boost for that engine.
DOM:

It's gonna be a bomb.
Only needs to go a mile.
(CROWD CHEERING)
(ENGINES REVVING)
(IN SPANISH)
Are you ready for this, my family?
This is Havana!
Be fast.
Be safe.
But don't be last.

Vamonos!
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(LAUGHING)
(IN ENGLISH) That car belongs in the trash, bro!
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(HORN BLARING)
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
(CHILDREN CHEERING)
- FERNANDO:

(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
Ghost him.
MAN:

(PEOPLE YELLING)
Adi√≥s, Toretto!
Okay, Buster.
Let's see if this works.
- (TIRES SQUEALING) - (ENGINE REVVING)
That's impossible.
(ALL CHEERING)
(GLASS SHATTERING)
(TIRES SQUEAL)
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
(EXCLAIMS)
(CHEERING)
(IN ENGLISH) Look out!
(ALL CONTINUE CHEERING)
A deal's a deal.
You won my car.
And you earned my respect.
Keep your car.
Your respect is good enough for me.
DOM:

Sorry about your car.
Yours was too slow for a Toretto, anyway.
Your Impala?

(ALL CHEERING)
Look at that smile.
I love it when you smile.
You make me happy.
Mmm, I think this place makes you happy.
It's like it speaks to you.
You remember that guy, the racer and his dad?
The one with the boat engine under the hood?
Yeah!
- Yes.

I was looking at them, and I...
And I couldn't help but to imagine what you'd be like if you were a dad.
No, no, no!

Is that what you want?
It's not about what I want or what you want.
It's about why we haven't asked the question.
(ENGINE CRANKS SLOWLY)
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
- (IN ENGLISH) What?

Yeah, I think I do.
- Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.

Probably the shut-off solenoid.
Let's see if we can get some power to it.
What brings you to Cuba?
The same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba.
Culture, people, the beauty.
What brings you to Cuba?
- Work.

How's that honeymoon going, Dom?
Your fuel relay is missing.
I know.
I love to play games.
I've beaten the best of 'em.
But I'm kind of in a rush, so if you've got something to say to me...
Oh, this is a very different game, that I can assure you.
This...

This is fate.
I choose to make my own fate.
Not today.
Is this the road you take to your apartment every morning?
What else is different, Dom?

Did you have to cross two blocks to go get your Cuban coffees?
What is it, black, no sugar?
Yeah.
I put a lot of work into getting you here today.
Well, now that I'm here, what do you want?
I want you to work for me.
Work for you?
Oh, I could've saved you a lot of time, then.
See, I don't work for anyone.
You can't walk away from this, Dom.
We're gonna have this conversation, one way or the other.
You see, that's the funny thing about fate.
It's cunning.
It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
Oh, you're gonna want to work for me.
You're gonna betray your brothers, abandon your code, and shatter your family.
You see, your team is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.
What's that?
You.
Oh, and, Dom, I wouldn't mention this to anyone.
(ENGINE STARTS)
HOBBS:

So we wanna engage with maximum speed.
Neutralize their shooters, and then move on to our objective.
There's two things I want you to keep in mind.
Number one, I chose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.
And number two, you go out there, you do your job, and you take 'em down.
Everyone.

Mani's and pedi's at the mall later on today.
(ALL CHEERING)
Huh?
- (WHISTLE BLOWING)

(CHANTING HAKA)
(ALL CHANTING HAKA)
(EXCLAIMS)
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
(WHISPERS) What?
(WHISTLE BLOWS)
I don't wanna play anymore.
All right, let's go, girls.

Final two minutes.
DS ALLAN:

HOBBS:

Yeah, it's the moms.

Except there seem to be more moms than kids.
Way more moms.
(WOMEN GIGGLING)
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

Let's go, girls!
So, your intel was spot-on.
That Damocles 7 EMP weapon that went missing in the Gulf?
Arms dealers from the Liberation Front have it in Berlin.
HOBBS:

This thing can wipe out an entire electrical grid in a major city.
No lights, no power.
Instant Stone Age.
Chloe, Maya, you can't let her run by you like that.
- Let's go, let's go!

Do you have any idea what's at stake here?
Yes, I know exactly what is at stake here, okay?
If the Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragons, that means we lose the championship.
Which means I have 20 little girls who are crying, and that's not a good thing.
Which then means I have to spend a lot of time in ice-cream shops and a lot of time at Tay Tay concerts.
Tay Tay?
Taylor Swift.

Let's go, girls!
We need you to do this.

All right, but I need to be clear here.
The US government cannot sanction this operation in any way.
- You're on your own.

If this thing goes sideways, you don't just get burned.
You go to prison.
And there's nothing we can do to get you out.
Let me tell you something.
The only thing that I love more than saving lives is my daughter.
So, if you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now, and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons,
I'm gonna have all 20 of them line up and kick you right in the tay-tay.
Go Dragons!
Say it again.
Go Dragons!
Attaboy.

- Go Dragons.

- SAM:

Yes!

(WHISTLE BLOWS)
That is my daughter right there.

Yes, come here.
How did I do?
Awesome.
Nice job, kid.
- (HOBBS SIGHS)

Uh, yeah.

Now, you're gonna need to get a team you can trust.
Oh, I already got one.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
(SIGHS)
HOBBS:

Hey, Hobbs.
I got a job in Berlin and I need a favor, brother.
No problem.

Thanks, man.

(GRUNTS)
You were only supposed to create a diversion, Roman.
That was a diversion!
How many of the damn explosives did you use?
ROMAN:

- All of it?

Roman, Jesus Christ.
We got more of your fan club ahead.
They're still on us!
These guys are taking this personal.
Roman, we just blew up their facility and stole their EMP.
Other than your doctor's cold finger, I'd say it's about as personal as it can get.
Phase Two!
Phase Two?

What happened to Phase One?

Yeah.

Everyone drove their cars out but you?
I told you, my engine seized up.
It's your balls that seized up.
Just follow my lead, okay?
And, Roman, whatever you do, don't think.
Huh?
Tej, drop it!
Bombs away.
(BEEPS)
Split, now!
ROMAN:

ROMAN: (OVER RADIO) Great plan, Tej.
But just so you know, you missed some.
Oh, just wait for it.
ROMAN:

I hate you, Tej!
(LAUGHS)
Got your ass.
You good?
I'll see you when it's done.
All right, great job, team.
Let's break off and meet me at the safe house.
(ENGINE REVVING)
A hell of a job, brother.
When we get back to the base, the beer's on me.
(GASPING)
(GRUNTS)
You lost your goddamn mind, Toretto?
Toretto, you put hands on that thing, you're gonna have the whole world gunning for you, including me.
(DOM GRUNTS)
I don't know what you're doing, but you better think about this, Toretto.
It ain't too late to stop this.
It is now.
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(SIRENS BLARING)
That sumbitch just crossed us.
- What?

Dom took the EMP.
Bullshit.
Where are you?
HOBBS:

Saw that look in his eye, and I've seen that look before.
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.
TEJ:

It's a whole bunch of calls to untraceable numbers.
ROMAN:

TEJ:

Same number, but they got some sort of micro-router to bury the signal path, which means Dom is clearly communicating with somebody that's above our pay grade.
Look, I don't know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts,
Dom's been having highly encrypted conversations with some mysterious person.
He took out Hobbs.
He stole an EMP.

So, what are you saying?
Maybe we should consider the fact that Hobbs is right.
Dom did go rogue.
(CAR DOOR SLAMS)
ROMAN:

LETTY:

You just gonna let her bump your shoulder like that?
I'm just saying, that was a little aggressive.
What you gonna do, email her?
(SIGHS)
(WHISPERS) Check.
(CELL DOOR BUZZING)
Moment, will you, fellas?
Thank you.
Well, this is an exciting new look.
It's a little tight in the crotch, as always.
(CHUCKLES)
What boy-band bus did she fall out of?
It's my new junior associate.
He's working with me on this.

Mr. Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.
All you have to do is agree to the terms and you're free.
What's training wheels talking about?

Confess to your crimes in Berlin.
Treason, international espionage, massive destruction of civic property.
You do that, we close the case.
- And?

Germany loves that.
LITTLE NOBODY:

MR. NOBODY:

You need to work on your delivery, all right?
Unofficially...
You're off the books.

I'm not a criminal.
MR. NOBODY:

There is no confession.
There are no backroom deals.
I got myself into this, I'm gonna get myself out of it.
- You know that.

Well, there you have it.
Good luck in the courts, man.
What about your daughter?
You know, if you're not gonna do it for your country, at least do it for your kid.
(CHUCKLES) Big mistake, kid.
(EXCLAIMS)
Hold on.

He's still working from the manual.
I mean, he doesn't even really know the rules.
Now, come on, give him a break.
(STRAINED) Give me a break.
Luke.
(GRUNTING)
Appreciate it.
(COUGHING)
It's good to see you, Nobody.
You, too.
Rule number one...
Know your audience.
I gave you your shot.

Now I'm gonna show you how to get this done.
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
You're dead, cop.

INMATE:

DECKARD:

Luke Hobbs behind bars.

The bent cop got his day.
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
(CELL DOOR BUZZING)
You know, that color looks good on you.
Yeah, it'll look a whole hell of a lot better with your blood on it.
Yeah, good luck with that, Hercules.
Lawman gone bad, huh?
Such a cliche.
Oh, well, welcome to the club.
I wouldn't get that twisted, son.
We ain't in no club, we got nothing in common.
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
What, you bring a shovel, did you?
Because it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.
Or so I've been told.
(DECKARD CHUCKLES)
Better get to digging.
Wanker.
Yeah.
Move.
Say that again.
If I say it again, it'll be to a corpse.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm gonna enjoy this.
CIPHER:

Nice job out there.
You excited about tonight?
You're going on this?
You're with me, Dom.
Showing me your shoe collection?
Yep.
A pair for every occasion.
You have enough guns in here to outfit a small army, huh?
Oh, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
You know what I like about you, Dom?

I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.
Which is surprising, because when I saw you in Cuba,
I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle, and you let him keep his car?
Oh, that confused you?
Hmm.
'Course I could've taken his car.
But it's about something bigger.
This way...
I changed him.
That's not your responsibility.
- But it's who I am.

Let me ask you something, Dom.

- Family.

Not if you're being honest.
It's the 10 seconds between start and finish, when you're not thinking about anything.
No family, no obligations.
Just you.
Being free.
I gotta tell you, this whole saving-the-world, Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently?
It's bullshit.

Be who you are.
Why live only a quarter mile at a time when you can live your whole life that way?
(PANTING)
Is that it?
Is that all those bloated-out muscles will give ya?
All show and no go.
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTING)
Oh, I got plenty of go.
You must've misplaced that when I kicked your arse up and down that office of yours.
Yeah.
Just like you Brits, rewriting history, huh?
All I know is, it wasn't me that was thrown out of a four-story window.
Jumped.
I jumped out of a four-story window, saving my partner's life.
'Cause where I'm from, we don't settle fights by throwing bombs.
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue.
I mean, do you really believe you can stand in front of me and beat me in a straight-up, old-fashioned fist fight?
Let me tell you something.
Me and you, one-on-one, no one else around.
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.
Maybe one day we'll find out.
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.
(DOOR BUZZES)
I said no, Mr. Nobody.

I'll get out my way.
(ALARM BLARING)
The right way!
Hey!

Relax.

- Get back!

(GRUNTING)
(GRUNTING)
Stop him!

(GRUNTING)
(GROANING)
(GRUNTING)
(YELLING)
MILLER:

I've been waiting a long time for this.
Keep waiting, bitch.
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
Rubber bullets.

(GROANING)
(YELLS)
(GRUNTING)
(ALL GRUNTING)
(BOTH PANTING)
Well, that took longer than I expected.
- HOBBS:

- My daughter?

- Toretto?

It's interesting you ask.
This is my new base.

It's a little sterile for you.
(CHUCKLES)
Listen, there's something I wanna talk to you about after.
Hey, listen, guys.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

It's called abuse of power.
You told me to round them up.
I didn't tell you to hand...
Cut 'em loose.

I'm sorry, guys, really, I...
So, this is how you treat old friends?
TEJ:

Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.

Nobody.

Him?

Clearly, we're getting nowhere with nobody.
I've been in here for four hours, and my ribs are showing.
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.
- I wouldn't recommend that.

Well, thanks to your botched Berlin job, you all made Interpol's Top 10 Most Wanted list.
- Top 10.

That's all right.
- Well, not you, Roman.

You just missed the cut.

- I'm...

ROMAN:

What number did they come in at?
Six, eight, nine, ten.
- She's 10?

That's impossible.

Oh, she's definitely a 10. (SCOFFS)
How about we focus on someone who we're not gonna find on anybody's list.
We're awaiting hard confirmation, but I believe that's the cyber terrorist known as Cipher.
Wait, no.

Not according to our sources.
What does she want?
No one knows.
Cipher is like a digital act of God.
They...

Anything that can be hacked is hers to play with.
And here's the kicker.

Her digital identity is scrubbed every few seconds, worldwide.
So, basically, she's the bogeyman.
Damn, she's one of the hottest bogeymans I've ever seen.
I mean, if y'all know her, tell her to get at your boy.
- (ROMAN CHUCKLES) - (CLEARS THROAT)
- What are you, 12?

Let's just say, people are scared of the hacker group Anonymous.
But even Anonymous won't mess with her.
What the hell does any of this have to do with us?
Probably nothing, Letty, but I do find it interesting that, apparently, for some reason, she's now working with this guy.
(SIGHS)
He's already delivered a fully operational EMP into her hands.
Detonate that, they can turn any city in the world into a war zone.
So, then, what is it you're suggesting we do?
MR. NOBODY:

Well, first, let's catch him, and then figure out why he's turned.
So, y'all want us to track Dom.
Yeah, I know, Roman, it's kind of a big job.
It's impossible.
Which is why I'm bringing in an extra pair of hands.
Ah, my day just got a whole hell of a lot better.
Mr. Nobody, you wanna tell me why you just put me in a room with this tea-and-crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?
What a big mouth on a small head, coming from Prisoner 6753.
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.
We are not teaming up with this guy.
Let's get one thing clear.

I don't care about you, your crew, or your little family.
I'm here for Cipher.
What are you gonna do, apply for a job?

You know, I think that tight T-shirt's cutting off the circulation to your brain.
You should get a bigger size.
Cipher came to me first.

When I said no, she went after my brother.
Ah, yes, brother Owen.

Former hell-raiser and current guest at a nasty little black site prison.
Cipher corrupted him and left him for dead.
So, if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.
You're taking my boot right up your ass, is what you're taking.
Guys, guys.

Now, aside from myself, there's only two men in the world that have ever managed to actually track him down with any success.
And guess what.

So, like it or not, you two are gonna work together.
You got that?
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
Am I the only one seeing this?
Oh, this ought to be good.
(MUMBLES)
Use God's Eye.
We put our lives on the line, running around the world trying to figure this thing out.
It can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.
Roman, that is a great idea.
Did you hear that? "Great idea."
No, no, no, don't tune it out.

Mr. Nobody, let's fire it up, huh?
TEJ:

Yeah.
(BEEPING)
RAMSEY:

ROMAN:

TEJ:

RAMSEY:

MR. NOBODY:

But Cipher's already created an evasion that masks their location by pinging random spots all over the globe, but it was a good thought, Roman.
So, she's made my program obsolete.
And that, Ramsey, is why you're here.
See, simple solutions aren't gonna cut it here, slick.
Why you look at me when you say that?
Wait a second.

You see, in order for God's Eye to give off all these false pings, means they have to be using a FLEA relay.
Watch these two.
Which means it has a decaying sync randomizer.
Which we can reverse...
And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location.
I'm telling you, they got skills.
That was my idea.
That's what I was saying.

All right, let's try this.
It's working.
Time you wanna check your manual and start organizing a force response.
Let's get a hold of our international assets...
He's still green.
Yeah, like fresh baby shit.
As soon as we have Toretto's location, I want to mobilize.
Let's get a hold of a better asshole.
No one respects you...

Get away from me.
All right, they're not in China.
Or Russia.
Europe's clear.
But this one's not going away.
(BEEPING)
This is interesting.
Why?
(BEEPING RAPIDLY)
Because that's here.
(GRUNTING)
(GRUNTING)
(EXCLAIMS)
(MAN COUGHING)
CIPHER: (ECHOING) Did you all enjoy that?
Next-generation concussion grenade.
It scrambles your senses.

- (GROANING)

Hello, Deckard.

(LAUGHING) Look at this, body's not even cold, Dom.
Your family's already replacing you.
You chose the losing team.
I guess your brother is smarter than you.
(DECKARD GRUNTING)
(BEEPING)
Smart move, embedding God's Eye into the mainframe.
Irritating to make me have to come all the way down here to get it, but...
Let's go.
(ALL GROANING)
Dom!
You're gonna turn your back on family?

Let's go.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
HOBBS:

That wasn't him.
I don't know what she's got on him, but that wasn't Dom.
Brian would know what to do.
No!
We can't bring Brian and Mia into this.
We agreed on that.
ROMAN:

DOM:

And was it even necessary?
Necessary?
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.
And I simply made one.

You could've stopped me, but you chose not to.
I wonder what Letty thought about that.
The problem with putting your foot on a tiger's neck is you can never let it up.
I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
(GASPS)
Elena.
ELENA:

I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have come.
Nothing could have kept me away.
Now she has the three of us.
(BABY COOING)
Do you wanna see him?
See Papa?
(BABY GURGLING)
See Papa.
Papa.
(COOING)
When I realized I was pregnant, you had just found out Letty was alive.
So I decided when Letty and you got back from your honeymoon,
I was going to tell you.
But then she took us before I had the chance.
(COOS)
His name?
(CONTINUES COOING)
I call him Marcos.
But that's his middle name.
I thought his father should give him his first name.
I'm sorry, Dom.
There's nothing to be sorry for.
ELENA:

Your son.
CIPHER:

I know.

I just let the guards go, so there's only two opponents in the room.
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first.
I know you.
And then you're thinking, Elena's a cop.
Maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.
(WHISPERS) So much to think about.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Let me make it easier for you.
Do with it as you wish.
Have you heard of Choice Theory, Dom?
There is a bunch of axioms, but only two you really need to concern yourself with.
One, the only person's behavior we can control is our own.
And, two, the only thing we can truly give another person is information.
So, let me give you some.
You see these cameras in here?
The moment you make a move, highly-paid men with weapons will make their way into this room with one very specific instruction.
It's not to save me.
It's to kill your son.
Now, that's a lot of bullets, and it only takes one for you to lose everything.
So, I have to ask you, because I know family is so important to you.
Is that really a choice you want to make?
Because I'm ready if you are.
If I pull this trigger, and God knows I want to, if I killed everyone on this plane, I still couldn't get in there.
'Cause of your two-man fail-safe system.
Since I'm alone,
I got no choice!
I didn't think so.
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch.
(SOBBING)
Bitch.
- Don't, don't.

Please!
LITTLE NOBODY:

She wiped it all.

That was the one thing we could use to find them.
We lost everything.
What do you got, Princess?
Finding Toretto.
But I got a couple of minutes to spare, if you want me to send you to the hospital.

(CHUCKLES) Yo, Rules.
First off, that's not my name.
- Little Nobody.

Oh, that's definitely sticking.
Great.

We find Toretto together as a team.
And when this is all over with,
I'm happy to slap that whisker biscuit right off his face.
Wait a minute, guys, I think Deckard's actually onto something.
How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?
Ghost flights.
I thought untraceable aircraft was all Internet conspiracy stuff.
MR. NOBODY:

Satellites and radar grids all across the globe shift like an ocean.
They've got channels that open and close.
And theoretically, if you know the right people who know the right patterns...
You can fly right through the blind spots completely undetected.
So you know where Dom is headed?

ROMAN:

(ALL GRUNTING)
ROMAN:

Before I throw up in my mouth, let me ask you, what are we doing here?
That's a good question, Roman.
Let me show you.
Welcome to our new base of operations.
No, seriously.

This is heaven.
It's the agency garage.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
LITTLE NOBODY:

Now, Mr. Nobody said that if we're gonna have a chance at catching Dom, we're gonna have to be damn fast.
Figured this would help.
We got a tank.
750 horsepower, 6.6 liter, V8 Duramax engine with an M153 CROWS remotely operated weapon station on top.
You didn't get this from drug dealers.
LITTLE NOBODY:

See, the Army's developing machines like this that soldiers can drive from a mile away, so they can stay safe and alive.
But, luckily, there's a backup driver's seat for those of us that like to get more "hands on."
ROMAN:

No one is getting "hands on."
She doesn't go on city streets.
Wow.

Again, no, no.
That's a million-dollar show car.
The point is to not draw attention.
It's reverse psychology.
Dom would never see it coming.
It's neon orange.
The International Space Station would see it coming.
Go choose anything less conspicuous.
ROMAN:

- This is ridiculous.

Hey, my man, you can put that down right there.
This is a gift, a real gift.

(LAUGHS) I like your beard.
You're Blanta.

No, I'm serious.

What are you doing?
Engine's misfiring.

No, that's not part of the plan, Dom.
DOM:

But unless you want the engine to seize on the job...
You have five minutes.
(MOUTHING) Five minutes.
I want another visual.
I got an ATM.
I don't like this.
I want to see Toretto.
- There are no more cameras.

Punch in on something reflective.
A car mirror, anything.
Do you know who I am?
It's why I'm here.
Do you know what I'm capable of?
It's why I'm here.
I'll give you until I finish me cuppa.
And I'm fucking thirsty.
I've got limited time, so I won't take up too much of yours.
Oh, no.
No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto.
What more could you possibly want?
To give you something back.
Talk to me.
Something's not right here.
First time I saw my son was behind a bulletproof glass.
When he reached for me, I couldn't hold him.
It's the worst pain I ever felt.
I know you know exactly how that feels.
Maybe we could change that.
Now, why do I think you're about to suggest something really dodgy, Mr. Toretto?
It's why I'm here.
Jesus, punch in on something.

- Rhodes, you close?

Something about this whole thing that just doesn't add up to me.
Well, that would be the same kind of funny math that says a DSS agent who has a Silver Star for valor stole an EMP.

You want to give me a hand?

You love me.

You should've given him the case, 'cause I won't chase you.
Okay.
I will just take it from a dead girl.
DOM:

Let's go, then.
HOBBS:

They're gone.
And DOD confirmed it was a nuclear football.
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.
I don't know what it is, but they're building towards something.
Deckard?
LITTLE NOBODY:

(GRUNTS)
CIPHER: (OVER INTERCOM) I'm disappointed in you, Dom.
When push came to shove, you were gonna let Letty just walk away with the codes.
You got the codes!
Rhodes got the codes.
You made the choice to let her go.
And now I have to make one of my own.
(MUFFLED SOBBING)
(WHISPERING) They are adorable little things, aren't they?
God, I hope I don't hurt him.
Look, psychotic, I did exactly what you asked me to do.
Don't do this.
This is your doing.
My doing?
BABY TORETTO: (BABBLING) Da-dada.
Dada.
Da-da.
Please don't hurt him, I'm begging you.
I don't want you to beg.
I want you to learn.
Learn what?
I understand why you did what you did.

Da-da.
But it was the wrong choice.
This is the consequence of that.
(MUFFLED SCREAMING) No!
No!

Wait, wait, wait.

Save your son!
No!
(GUNSHOTS)
(CRYING)
(SHUSHING)
(EXHALES)
Can you pull up the footage from the guy in the alley?
Traffic cams.
I got you.
I knew it.
I recognize that guy.
That's Connor Rhodes.
I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother.
He wanted us to get the Nightshade device for him.
Connor Rhodes.
He's also linked to somebody I'd quite like to forget.
It's Mose Jakande.
Warlord who tried to get God's Eye.
Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.
Everything you're feeling right now, this rage, a sense of loss, it's not real.
It's a survival instinct wired deep into our brains to ensure continuation of the species.
When early man would visit a watering hole, if they didn't watch their child, and it got snatched by a crocodile,
our brains would create a painful but instructional memory, so it would never happen again.
This idea of "family" that is so core with you, that rules your world,
it's a biological lie.
You don't have to accept it.
I don't.
Did you really think you could destroy two of my teams without any repercussions?
I wouldn't have even looked your way if you hadn't done that.
You didn't even know you had a kid.
You can thank me for that and start doing the job I'm asking you to do.
Help you start a war.
Is that what you think I want?
That's so limited.
I didn't take that football to start a war any more than I took your son to start a family.
Taking your son got me the codes.
The codes will get me the nukes and the nukes will get me what I want today, tomorrow, and every day after that.
And what's that?
Accountability.
The second I fire off one of those nukes,
I put the superpowers of this world on notice that, when they cross the line,
I'm gonna be there to hold them responsible.
Because the truth is, Dom, to the world out there,
I am the crocodile at the watering hole.
We've got one last job to do.
DOM:

If I were you, I'd kiss my son.
Because whether you value it or not, all of this, your plane, your security, and you,
are still on this earth because of him.
RAMSEY:

But now, we have Rhodes' information.
And we're getting snapshots of his data before it's scrubbed off the net.
That looks like somebody's bank account, so why don't we just go ahead...
It's a longitude.
Given the fact that Dom hit a Russian motorcade, it's safe to say it's Russia.

Good.

Yalta, Poltava...
It's like they just threw letters together.
Kronyurt.
MR. NOBODY:

- What are you doing here?

Told you I was gonna check in on you from time to time to see how you were doin'.
By the way, not so hot.
But there's nothing in Vladovin.

That's funny.
Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base where they retrofitted Cold War submarines.
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.
The base was taken over by a terror group of military separatists about a month ago, and the Russians haven't taken it back yet, so there is a little window of opportunity here.
Russian submarines.

It sounds like everything we do, our legs gonna be blown off.
It sounds like you still number 11 on the list. (CHUCKLES)
It sounds like you've changed since your little punk-ass facial hairs done came in.
Guys, guys.
Hey, we gotta call this in.

That's good thinking, champ, except unfortunately, the Russian Minister of Defense got himself involved in a little incident on US territory, and the two governments aren't talking to each other for a while.
By the time they do, it'll be too late.
So, any other suggestions?
HOBBS:

How about we just stop them ourselves?
You're talking about a Russian military base.
Separatist.
Whatever.

It's stopping World War III.
What's it gonna be, rook?
You gonna close your eyes on this one, too?
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come knocking on your mama's front door?
Or, are you gonna saddle up, be a man, and save the entire goddamn world?
You know, I think I figured it out.
What's that?
- Rule number three.

There are no rules.
(MR. NOBODY LAUGHS)
What'd I tell you, Luke?

LITTLE NOBODY:

Take whatever vehicle you want.

- All bets are off?

Do svidanya!
Letty, I don't like telling you this one bit.
But the game's changed.
Before, we were just trying to catch Dom, but now, after all this,
I want you to know, if I have to,
I'm gonna put him down.
Then you might have to take us both down.
ROMAN:

(BREATHING HEAVILY) This ain't for me.
I come from a different kind of lifestyle, brah.
Ladies know me.

I tried to take a piss, I didn't even recognize myself.
Man, that's entirely too much information.
I'm just sayin'.
Well, one thing's for sure.
Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a trade, because no one would be this insane to hit this place without a damn army.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
HOBBS:

All right, Dom, you're one step closer to that family reunion.
400 meters to base.
Prep the EMP.

(ENGINE REVVING)
(MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
We have a possible threat approaching.
Raise the barricade.
We've lost power, defensive positions now.
(CLAPS) (IN ENGLISH) Gates are open.

(SOLDIERS YELLING IN RUSSIAN)
- EMP is recharging.

Sixty seconds.
All right, Dom, you have one pulse left in that EMP.
That sub is heavily insulated.
You're gonna need to be right underneath it for this thing to work.
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(GRUNTING)
- Come on.

Engaging target.

(ALARMS BLARING)
Mayday!

CIPHER:

Two birds with one stone.
SUPER JET TECH:

Dom, we are good.

Okay, Matty, let's take this baby for a spin.
TEJ:

I think Cipher just rebooted that sub to slave its command system.
What the hell is he talking about?
In layman's terms, she just carjacked a submarine.
We can't let it get away.
There's the control room.
If you can get me into that wheelhouse,
I can tap the network and counter-hack Cipher.
Keep it from lowering into the water.
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.
I find the weapons room and I can pull the launch chip before she can fire any of those nukes.
That is too crazy.
What you're saying is too dangerous.
We'll do both.
Knock, knock.
(SOLDIERS YELLING IN RUSSIAN)
(IN ENGLISH) Five vehicles just breached the base.
They just don't give up, do they?

All right, team, here's the plan.
There's a sea lock at the opening of the bay.
We get there first and close it, we can stop the submarine from escaping into open water and disappearing forever.
I've got the location.

Maybe 'cause you're in an orange Lamborghini, I don't know.
Shut up, Tej!

Huh?
I didn't think so.
They're heading for the sea lock.

You realize this is classified, right?
Not today.
(CAMERA CLICKS)
Unbelievable.
All right, can we get up outta here, now?

It's okay.
Don't worry.

ROMAN:

Computer hacks, God's Eye, geeks, nerd...

But we got a lot in common, too, right?
Like what?
We walk in the room and we're oozing' sex appeal.
Me and you, hip to hip, is a problem.
I'm askin' a real question right now.
Is it gonna be Revenge of the Nerds or The Dark Knight?

To be honest, I like both of you.
(ROMAN AND TEJ EXCLAIMING)
But just before we get into all of that, let me ask you one question.
You can ask me anything.
Anything.
What's my last name?
When you guys figure it out, then, I guess you can let me know.
It's gonna be Parker.

- ROMAN:

- Right?

LETTY:

Letty.
I wanted to thank you.
No need.
Well...
Cipher's still on the loose.

Thanks to you guys.
So, I got you a party favor.
- (MR. NOBODY LAUGHS)

Your record's been cleared.

You've got your job back.
That is, if you want it.
If I want?
Mmm-hmm.
(LAUGHS)
You know, after 16 years, I figure it's time for a little break.
Wow.
Daddy's stayin' home.
(LAUGHS)
Nobody.
Keep in touch.
Ah.

This could be interesting.
(SIGHS) What made you think I'd do it?
Brotherhood.
I saw that look you gave Cipher, knew you wanted revenge.
Glad I did it.
I can't believe you went to see my mother.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
All this fuss over you.
(COOING)
Yes.
Elena, I promised to keep our son safe.
And now, he always will be.
I wanna introduce you to the most important person in my universe.
One who never gave up on me.
He's beautiful.
DOM:

You wanna meet them?
All right.
Everyone, meet Brian.
(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

HOBBS:

ROMAN:

Okay, I guess it's my turn to say grace.
We thank you for giving us family.
We sit here in praise.
