You will get nothing from me, young man.
I worked too hard in this life to let someone...
Do you wanna end up dead?
No, no, please, don't hurt me.
Are you fucking kidding me?
No!
Not on my watch, motherfucker.
Do you wanna die right now?
I'll die here!
No, please, God!
Shut up!
I'm not gonna give you anything!
On your ass I'll pull the trigger if you don't shut your mouth!
You're hurting me, you're hurting me!
Did I hurt you?
Do you like to hurt an old man, do you?
Now give me your fucking wallet.
No, please don't hit!
Help!
Help me!
Shut up your fucking mouth!
Help me!
God, where is everybody?
Is there nobody in this fucking world, who can help me, for God's sake?
Elders like you always bring money.
Where is your fucking wallet?
Now give me your fucking wallet!
Where is your fucking wallet?
Right now, where is it?
Fuck you!
I'll fuck you if you don't give me your wallet.
May I please speak with Laird?
No, just tell him Wade called, thank you.
Give me your wallet!
Can you hear me?
Help!
Shut up!
Help!
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Wow, nice suit!
Zip it, Stan Lee!

Oh, Jesus!
Oh, that's not good.
No, no, no.
Oh, you're not gonna walk that one off.
Oh, that's so gross.
I'm so sorry.
If I'm being honest with myself, I should have just called 911.
Well, none of that matters now.
I think we're both, missing the real point here.
What the fuck is a phone booth doing on a street corner?
Didn't those disappear in '98?
Suppose I could have just used my cell.
A Cherry Garcia ice cream?
You gonna eat this?
Don't answer now.
Just rest.
Actually I made a call.
The stupid costumer.
I don't know how the other guys do it so quickly.
You probably wouldn't be dead if it was Logan.
What's he gotta change into?
Guy wears a fucking tank top and a pair of jeans.
Yeah.
Want to get my tank top on?
Bit of perspiration, Have a nice, little... crime-fighting spree, yeah.
Happy Hug-A-Koala Day...
