She hasn't broken out yet.
Ah, right.

I'm just the guy looking out for the Institute and Kyle's needs.
- You've only got two hours.

Until you read with Kyle West.
I'm going to Oslo.

What makes you think that you can stop it?
That was amazing.
You are amazing.
The whole world wants to work with Kyle West.
He can do whatever he wants.
He's into the whole self-actualizing
Institute of the Higher Mind stuff.
That's what makes him cult-y and weird.
I don't want to go back to reality, and I won't do it quietly.
He's offering you a contract marriage.
If you sign this, you are going to be able to do whatever you want.

There are people out there who want to see you fail.
And they'll look at everything that happened the past few days and think, "Oh, well, look at how much publicity she got."
And all I can say about that is... that none of it is worth spending a second of your life feeling powerless.
And if there's anything that this has taught me, it's that I can choose not to feel powerless.
And I'll never let that happen again.

Megan is the most powerful person I know.
Well, you two make an incredible couple.
Thank you again for sitting down with me today.
Thank you.
And we're out.
- Wow.

- Thank you.

Very nice to meet you.
Megan.

So... have you talked to Megan?
Mm, not since the party.
She's too busy with her fake life.
What are you talking about?
Oh, I-I guess you didn't see how she was acting that night.
I saw how you were acting.
Well, at least I was real.
She ran around that party like,
"Look at me.

Two weeks ago, I was holding her hair back while she puked in bushes.
I was actually the one holding her hair.
Things change for people.

She doesn't even return our calls.
I can't believe you're cool with that.
Are you seriously playing the jilted friend right now?
Oh, God, I can't believe you don't see this.
Her guy kicked me out of his party...
- Hope, no he...

You were pretty wasted.
Are you sure that's how it went down?
Kyle West is not a good guy.
Shh.
I saw it in his eyes.

He acts sweet and perfect, and it's bullshit.
He's really just a product of the Institute of the Higher Mind, which I've also heard terrible stories about.
And now he's got his hooks into Megan.
- I think that...

Wait.

You're the one who leaked the photos?
[whispering] Are you serious?
[dramatic music]
Hope.
Wha...
How did you get them?
I copied them from her phone when we were at Ace for New Year's, 'cause I was gonna make her a gag gift for her birthday, but...
What?

[normal voice] Oh, my God, this is sick, Hope.
[scoffs]
- It was for her own good.

That's bullshit.

[scoffs] It was all about you.
You saw yourself in Megan's rear-view the moment you walked into that party.
You decided you weren't gonna fit in.
Well, I tried.
Well, a real friend would try harder.
And if she can't do that, she would just get the hell out of the way.

I figured you weren't answering your phone.
You figured right.
It's okay.

What do you want, then?
I want to tell you that... you handled yourself really well at the studio today.
I was very impressed, and, um... you know, as a woman in this business, you sometimes have to accept things that you don't like because you have your eye on a bigger prize.
Look, I really don't want another explanation right now.
It's not an explanation, Megan.
You know, I really came here to tell you that things aren't always gonna be this way for you and me.
We're not always going to be the women behind the men.
That's gonna change.
I promise.

So, I read that you two met at an audition.
- Is it a real story?

Wow, you got a job and a boyfriend.
Now, that's a good audition, girl.
Just the boyfriend... but still a good audition.
Tell the truth.

Or were you just auditioning her to be your girlfriend?
- Stop tripping.
