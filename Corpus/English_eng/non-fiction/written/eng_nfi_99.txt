They'll need 80 points or more to make it to the next round, the duels, and fight their way through the cut, the divisional final, and then

And we're a hip-hop group from West Covina, California.
The Lab is a home away from home.
I feel like we're all connected, like brothers and sisters.
Boom, boom, Dada, Dada, hit, hit, boom, build and chill.
My name is Valerie, and I'm the creator of The Lab.
You're skilled enough to be able to connect on stage.
Prove to yourself what you have in you.
The majority of the kids come from broken homes, and these kids would definitely be described as underprivileged.
One and two and...
Having to, you know, kind of fend for themselves at times, put themselves to bed, get themselves to practice, feed themselves.
This is something that's really inspiring for me because I'm not just teaching dance,
It's actually more about teaching them life lessons, and dance is just kind of the icing on the cake.
No matter their circumstances, these are exceptionally skilled kids pursuing their dreams.
Their bond is the most special part about what they're going to bring to the stage.
There's been a lot of arguing in my family, and all the negativity just gets thrown away when I walk into the door.
This crew means the world to me, and I wouldn't be where I am right now if it wasn't for them.
Oh, now I'm going to cry.
We just support each other and love each other,
Sleepovers!
Next on stage, it's The Lab.

Oh, my goodness.
This what goes on in The Lab?
[cheering continues]
You guys came out like professionals.
It was, from beginning to end, exciting, unexpected, innovative, your moves, your synchronicity, everything about it was just so in sync.
There's something about being a kid that makes you fearless.
You're just like, you go all out and honestly, that's what it's going to take to win this competition.
Beast.
Man, like effortless, effortless.
Do you guys go to, like, the competitions and
You can tell the difference between people who are used to competing and people who are not.
This is a competition, and you guys competed.
[cheers and applause]
- Yeah!
Kaya came out with the monster.
Yeah, you're a little monster in the front.
There was a lot of passion in what you were doing.
We're going to lock in our scores right now, okay?
Remember, if you don't score 80 or above, the competition ends here for you.
We have this checklist.
It's got performance, technique, choreography, creativity, presentation, it's like the whole criteria, and so that's very clear about what we're looking for.
All right, let's see if you guys are going through.

You guys were great!
How do you feel?
Congratulations.
I can't wait to see what else you guys have in store.
Thank you.
That's how you set it up.
That had absolutely, like, every single thing
Groove, tricks, the dynamics, musicality.
I did not expect them to do tricks like that.
♪ ♪
You weren't just in sync physically.
You were in sync emotionally.
It was risky, but man did it pay off.
It's always nice when Younguns do some fresh and exciting stuff!
Your range of movement is endless, bam.
That's something that's either in you or it's not.
Who's next?
Only if everybody hits the dab at the same time.
Let's go.

♪ ♪
I make people laugh when I dance.
Little old-timer.
It's less of a choice and more of a natural instinct, but there's more to entertaining than just making people laugh and smile.
It's also making them feel something.
And this is the fiercest competition I've been around.
I feel like I won't go far if I don't show the judges that I can portray different emotions.
So tonight I'm just ready to kind of share that realness.
This particular dance is about growing up with separated parents.
This story means a lot to me, and I've lived through it.
Deep down inside, there's feelings that I don't express.
I've never had the guts to share my story like this before.
So I can see you're feeling a lot of emotions.
I didn't realize how emotionally not ready I was to do this piece.
You are full of emotion, full of heart.
You're doing it for people that love you and doing it for the love of your own passion and craft.
Next up on stage, Fik-Shun.
[cheers and applause]
You got this, you got this.
I have to be strong because this is a very hard thing for me to do, but with big risks come big rewards so no holding back.

Fik-Shun, this was obviously a very emotional performance.
I want you to tell me about what it was for you.
You know, I feel like people are very blessed to have both parents in their life.
I wasn't.
My parents have always been separated, and, you know, as a kid, to have your mom a thousand miles away, your dad a thousand miles away apart, it's tough.
And so no matter how far apart they are,
I'm just always trying to be the one in the middle to bring them together and... [cheers and applause]
As a performer and a dancer, you were so connected to every single beat.
Each part of your body almost became a part of the song, and it was such a moving thing to watch.
And a lot of kids have to go through this unfortunately, and there's a lot of moms out there like your mom, and it's great that you somehow kind of find through your art, the bright side of it,
and from that pain comes beautiful moments like this right now.
I was really surprised and pleasantly surprised to see that style in an emotional way.
We were sucked into it.
I mean, we were right there with you.
We were on that journey with you.
We were on every little emotion.
The way you popped, the way you hit things, the textures, is incredible.
The performance was water.
Water crashes, water flows, water is rough, water is soft.
You gave us all of that in a minute.
You gave us all of that in a minute.

19 dancers from Miami, Florida, and best known for our Latin dance.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Being from Miami, all of us are pretty much first and second generation South Americans or Caribbean, Cuban, Chile, and our parents have always taught us to work hard.
This is not people who are just dancing 24/7.
We have teachers, we have lawyers, software engineers.
[laughter]
We just need to do what we do.
Dancing became our life.
We would miss weddings, quinceaneras, graduations, things that we sacrificed because we really believe in this group.
I'm ready for some Miami, like, flavor and speed.
Whoo, I'm ready for this, yes.
Next to take the stage is Miami All Stars.

Miami All Stars.
You look very Miami, by the way.
[cheering and laughter]
I want to ask you guys a question.
Are you guys full-time professional dancers, or do you do other things?
We actually have a lot of different jobs.
We have a lawyer, a stunt man.
I'm actually a high school math teacher, so...
Wow.
If you were my math teacher, I wouldn't be here.
I'd be working for Apple or something.
[laughter]
So this is like your passion project, side thing?
We still need to pay the bills, but we're still chasing the dream kind of thing.
There's an unbridled enthusiasm and passion that you have.
It was why I wanted to be involved in this whole thing because of routines like that, because of dancers like you.
I will say there was so much going on.
Sometimes I didn't know where to look.
But for the most part, when you guys did lock in, it locked in like amazing.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Jennifer?
Te quiero, los quiero, gracias.
[cheers and applause]
Let's hear what Derek has to say.
Um, yeah, my biggest problem was the song choice.
I wasn't a big fan of the song choice.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
It was so much fun, so much energy.
When you guys came on, it was like bam, all right, these guys are ready to go.
That's what this is all about, is like confidence.
I would say there was tricks in there that I've seen before, but there was one trick in particular that I was really impressed with, that she kind of fell over into like a cartwheel, and I was like, oh, I wasn't expecting that,
I actually kind of wanted more of that.
So just remember that if you make it through.
There's this love for what you do in every single move, but I kind of found myself waiting on the trick.
For me, the dynamics weren't where I feel like this group has the potential to take them, and I felt like it was good.
It wasn't great for me, but it was good, it was good.
It's time to lock in our scores.

Next round, we're really gonna step it up.
Something new, something exciting.
We're going to work very hard because we were very close to that 80.
Wow!
It's going to take that type of creativity to win this competition.
Whoo!
Good damn job.
I sensed a little bit of nerves.
Oh, my God, Derek, you're such a good partner that I can already tell in like one second, I'm like...
I got you.
Always.
I'm so cold.
I feel like a Chihuahua.
Your hands are cold, so they're not warming me up.
I'm Luka, and I'm 19.
I'm Jenalyn, I'm 16, and we are from Toronto, Canada.
And we do Cabaret ballroom dance.
You would have absolutely no idea by the way we dance, but we're actually complete opposites.
Growing up, I did all kinds of sports.
I was captain of the football team, the basketball team.
Apparently, I don't exactly come across as a ballroom dancer.
[groaning]
He is more of the expressive and loud person.
I'm more of the quiet bookworm.
I'd always, like, think to myself, like, how could we ever dance together?
Like, how could this ever work?
Because we were just so opposite.
Don't give me that attitude.
Soon enough, we grew on each other and it ended up working for three years now.
We're here working our butt off to...
To kind of prove that, like, anything is possible really, as long as you put your mind to it.
Please welcome Luka and Jenalyn.

I personally loved this performance.
Song selection, that's honestly one of my favorite songs, it really and truly is.
All of us have been around the dance world for so many years, so it's always nice when two younguns come out and do some fresh and exciting stuff.
- So to me, that's the strongest part.
Jenalyn, I think what's going to take your performance to the next level is to really listen and interpret the dance with the lyrics, with the music, with the feeling of the character that you're playing within the dance,
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I do, I do, I do.
Those tricks, it was like a lift trick clinic.
You know, it was like, and look at this one and this one,
Ba-Ba, and the transitions were seamless and very creative which made them more interesting to watch.
Luka, when you're on your own, there was a moment where you like reached out to her, but that's exactly what it felt like, it was like, hey.
You know, I want to be like bam, you know what I mean?

We are a hip-hop crew from Norway called Quick Style.
Su and Bi, they're twins, and when we met the first time when we were around 12 years old, we figured out that we had the same interests in music.
Dance is not a big thing in Norway.
It's very rare for men to be dancing.
When we started dancing, we were too scared to show mom and dad, so we would say that we would go play soccer and we would go out and we would take the subway to town and dance.
[cheering]
We've made a name for ourself in Norway.
Winning "Norwegian Got Talent,"
the biggest competition in Norway.
- Still Norway is so small.
Like we've been kind of isolated from America.
This circle represents Norway.
We're big fish in this little pond, and this is the ocean with sharks everywhere.
That's scary.
I've actually watched a couple of your videos, and I don't understand how you move that quick and that clean.
I'm so excited for them to see you out there, because I know that they're going to go like this, boom.
Hopefully they won't expect what we will be doing.

I'm like, uh...
Why did you guys want to enter this competition?
And we've been dancing together for 12 years.
When we heard "World of Dance" is going on, and it's going to be the biggest dance competition, we had to be here.
I felt that, I felt your connection with each other.
You connected with the audience.
If there's more than one person on stage, then it needs to feel like there's one person on stage.
You all have to share the same body.
It has to be the same brain, and y'all definitely have that.
But should you guys make it through,
I'd like to see more dynamics from you, those wow moments.
Really, really in sync.
You weren't just in sync physically.
You were in sync emotionally.
That's the most important thing for us.

My name is Nick Daniels, and I'm a contemporary dancer from Miami, Florida.
♪ ♪
My mom owns a dance studio, so I've always been dancing around and watching everyone.
Growing up, I tried all sports and nothing really worked out.
So, my parents decided that I needed to do a dance class.
My dad was literally at every single recital, never missed one performance.
Even though he would sleep through some people's performances but not mine.
Having him by my side really just boosted me up.
When Nick was 13, Nick's dad got sick and he had cancer.
It was a while he had it, but he would go to work still, he would still drive me everywhere.
Like, I knew he had cancer but I didn't know how severe it was.
We were actually at a competition.
My husband was in the hospital and I got a call that he, um...
I never got to talk to him again.
And I think that he struggles with that to this day.
I wish that my dad would know that I love him and miss him.
Not only is today the biggest performance of Nick's life, but it's Nick's dad's birthday.
If Nick's dad was here, he'd be his biggest cheerleader standing, screaming, telling everybody, "That's my son."
And even though he's not standing next to me,
I feel him in here.

Every time I dance, I think of him.
I just know that he's watching over me, 'cause he knows that this is what I love.

I was going to say the strength that that takes.
It's overwhelming to watch your technique
And even in the moments when you grabbed your head and you went crazy, and I felt the frenzy of what you were trying to say with your dance.
We feel that emotion when you let us in.
If I ever wanted to know what contemporary looked like without the use of bones,
I do now.
