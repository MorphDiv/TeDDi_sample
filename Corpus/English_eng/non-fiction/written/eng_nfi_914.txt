Crime fighting gets an upgrade on APB.
- So, are you impressed?

Catch all new episodes Mondays.

Bones, Sleepy Hollow and 24:

- Why does it need to be you?

Only on Fox
A maverick billionaire...
My name is Gideon Reeves.
I built an empire making rockets, computers, robots...
Made over $100 billion.

I'm an engineer.
...touched by tragedy...
- The money!

My friend has been shot.
Where the hell are you people?

...takes on the biggest engineering challenge of his career...
I want justice for Elliot James Sully.
Give me the 13th district to run.
A civilian can't take over a police district.
They can, with a special appointment from this committee.
...to revolutionize a police force...
Technology doesn't solve cases, cops do.
You haven't met my technology.
Wow and save a city.
You guys are my partners.
We're gonna change the world.
You sure nobody followed you here?
No, man.

All right, show me, don't tell me.
Target ready?
Ready as she's gonna be.
We had to use female mannequins?
This is an old dress factory.
There were no, like, dude-equins.
Nice shot, Murph.
Impressive.
Maybe too impressive.
See?
Armor-piercing bullets, just like I said.
Not even our new vests can stop 'em.
Tico, you got these bullets from Hunter?
Yep, badass assault rifle, too.
Illegal in all 50 states.
And that ain't even the half of it.
You can get anything from Hunter.
You can buy guns and ammo to bring down a freaking tank.
No joke, guys.

Think about that.
Local gangbangers get that kind of firepower?
No.
We got to put Hunter out of business ASAP.
Yeah his testimony is not gonna cut it.
If you want Hunter arrested, you're gonna need more.
You hear that, Tico?
Got to get me a face-to-face, pal.
No, you-you think Hunter's just gonna sell to anyone?
Well, he sells to you, doesn't he?

Uh, that's not gonna work.
Um, then I guess we're not gonna help you with your drug charges after all.
You heard the boss lady.
Guys, come on.

That's a death sentence for me.
Only if he finds out, which he won't.
- Come on.

Yeah, I-I'll see what I can do.
Good.
We should get to the precinct, run this up the chain.
Tico, you get the ball rolling with Hunter.
Till the brass signs off.
Gonna take this bastard down.
Yes, Murphy, there is a Santa Claus, and it's me.
I am the St. Nick of law enforcement.
Do you have any idea how much stuff my elves have brought into the department this week alone?
We boosted the horsepower in the Caddys, we improved the flashbang grenades.
Hell, even the coffee is better.
I don't understand why there's this vendetta against me and everything that I'm doing.
Gideon, the coffee's great, but don't expect milk and cookies from the mayor.

So what, now he... he sends the state attorney's office
- to investigate me?

Not just any ASA.

Scott's gonna continue talking to our cops until he finds one that tells him exactly what he wants to hear.
What time is this witch hunt supposed to start?
Scott's not here yet, but he did send a list of people he wants to talk to, starting with Officer Reyes.
The officer who took a bullet on my watch.
Yes, I imagine his review of my tenure will be less than glowing.
Conrad's gonna talk to Reyes once he's done screaming at Brandt.
This guy sweeps everyone for bugs.
It's just too dangerous.
It doesn't make sense, Captain.
What's going on in there?
Soldier?
Bit of a situation.

Getting the sense there may be an issue.
Oh, yeah.
Brandt's supposed to make his first buy, but Conrad won't sign off.
They've been going at it like this all morning.
Well, I came here to fix problems.
You're making a bad call.
No, I'm making a safe call.
What seems to be the problem?
Remember me?
Dashing billionaire genius who bought the place?
I spent the last six months working this C.I.
Now the captain says I got to step away.
He's a trained soldier.
It's just a friggin' buy-walk.
This guy sweeps everyone for bugs.
If you wear a wire, he's gonna find it and I'm not sending you in there without a wire.
End of discussion.
Hang on.

I know this kind of thing is like engineering catnip to you, but before you start scratching the sofa, this is an officer's life we're talking about.
As long as this son of a bitch is out there, selling armor-piercing bullets, every damn cop in the city is a target.
If you can build something, Gideon, then build it.
Do you really think this is something you can do?
Come with me.
So what are we dealing with, here?
How exactly do these searches go in an undercover situation?
Well, Hunter usually has one of those guns that look for radio waves.
An RF scanner.

if we transmit in bursts, say every seven minutes, they're gonna have a hard time picking it up.
Wait, so are you saying that we're only gonna be in contact with Brandt every seven minutes?
It's based on a system I developed for our spy satellites.

Too risky.
Yeah, well, the best moves usually are.
So, this is what I'm thinking.
Hook up a camera like this to a microscopic transmitter.
That's a camera?
It's from Reeves Medical.
It's used for surgery.
And then we hide it with a small microphone in a piece of clothing.

- Would that work?

Cool, and then we just have to get the video and the audio to the transmitter.
Pete, what's the smallest wire that could handle that much data?
Uh, probably... something like this.
Mm, that's too big.
- I mean, they'll find that.

It's like running the Chicago River through a garden hose.
Pete, when a woman tells you size matters, it's best to stop arguing.
Hold on a second.
What if the wire is the clothes?
This is made of Reeves Industries smart fabric.
Each thread is actually a tiny wire.
What if we make this into a jacket?
- A jacket?

Gideon, you're talking about a $2 million jacket.
All right, so... put some sequins on it, make it look nice.
Let's do this.
Hey.
I'm not on the board, what's going on?
ASA Murphy wants to talk to you.
About what?
You'll have to ask him.
Reyes, hold up.
A little advice from someone who's been there:
when you're talking to lawyers from the city, keep your eyes open and stay sharp.
You're the one who swore to protect and serve.
Folks outside the department, they have another agenda.
As long as you remember whose side you're on, you'll be fine.
Got it?
Yeah.
I don't get it.

The world's first bespoke surveillance jacket.
Inside that snap, that's your camera.
What it sees, we see.
Okay, that's not my best angle, but you get the idea.
I added all these flaps to the pockets, so they don't gape.
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.
Can I keep it?
Uh, no.
That jacket is worth more than this building.
Okay, everybody, it is officially showtime.
Squad 1309, we're preparing to enter.
Christmas morning, finally here.
What, are you just jealous 'cause I'm about to make a Class X felony while you got to wait in the car?
Cobb, are you in place?
Yeah, south entrance is covered.
Ready on our end.
Okay, listen to me.
Make this buy and get out.
If anything doesn't sit well with you in there...
Anything at all...

I will.
Brandt, just one more thing.
What's up?
You religious at all?
Only when the Cubs are playing.
My mother bought me this when I graduated the academy.
It's St. Michael, the patron saint of cops.
So far, it's kept me safe on the job.
Thanks.
All right, it's time to roll.
Here he is.

I heard good things.
I'm Nick.
Yo, Nick is dope as hell, man.
He gets deals done.
This is going to be great, guys.
Let's hope so.
Check them both.
Turn around.
Turn around.
That's a nice damn jacket, bro.
They're clean.
See, no problems.
We'll see about that.
Gideon.
Look, I know I signed off, but this is making me nervous.
I got that sense, yes.
- Trust me, the jacket works.

Well, the data bears that out.
The computers were great, too, until they weren't.
About a month after we switched over, the entire system went down.
We damn near let a murderer walk.
Had to use every available officer to, uh, rebuild a month-long case in a day, by hand.
Well, I can assure you technology has come a long way since the Commodore 64.
Yeah, and I'm gonna trust you on that.
But in this business, you learn to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
So I need to know you're prepared.
Don't worry, Captain, I got this.
Here's your money.

If you want to count... count.
I'm sure it's good.
How long have you been working with my friend Tico here?
Oh, met in the service, '04.
Reconnected, what?

Six months.

Hunter was overseas, too, man.

Yeah, I heard that.
You two do a lot of business together?
Well, it's been a little slow lately, but, like, we're pretty much partners...
- ...which I think that...

I'm talking to him.
- Is there a problem?

I just like to know who I'm working with.
It's like Tico said, we're tight.
Partners.
Partners?

Well, that's... that's good to know.
I thought we weren't sending him in there blind.
Another 30 seconds, the first burst will come in, and then it's every seven minutes after that.
But in between each transmission...
We're looking at it.
Okay... five seconds out.
Here's the first video file.
Just like I said, heard good things.
There he is.
Still standing.
At least he was seven minutes ago.
He gets deals done.
Murphy, we see him.
We're scanning through the rest of the seven minutes to make sure he's okay.
Everything going okay?
That's a nice damn jacket, bro.
Jacket passed.
So far so good.
You ask me, a seven-minute delay is seven minutes too long.
Look, I don't love it either, but Brandt wanted to go in.
Let's be real here, he's an adrenaline junkie.
This dude'll chase a shiny nickel off the Hancock building just to get some action.
I know you're worried, Goss.

Captain said you wanted to see me?
Officer Reyes, come in, please.

How you feeling?
Well, I'll be better once I'm back on full duty.
Of course.
Now, listen, you've probably heard that I'm evaluating the recent changes here at the 13th.
You mean Gideon?
Well, the legality of his innovations, yes.
And how they impact officers' safety, more importantly.
Look... we just want to make sure that his toys aren't putting cops at risk.
And I think that you, more than anyone, more than anyone else here, you can speak to that.
I did notice that you mentioned that both the new Taser firearm and the drone were problematic in operation.
I wrote a report.
Well, I'd like to know a little bit more about that.
And I was hoping that you'd take me through the details of your shooting.
Actually, I was thinking you could take me back to the scene.
That way you can walk me through exactly what happened and where.
How about that?
Officer Reyes?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
I still got eyes on the south entrance, but there's more traffic coming in and out of here than the Kennedy.
How long does it take to buy some bullets?
It shouldn't be longer than 15 minutes.
Ah, Brandt's probably just showing off, trying to make it last.
Guy's been jonesing for this for weeks.
Gideon, how's that transmission?
Next transmission is three minutes out.
You got the ammo, or we're not gonna do this thing?
- 'Cause I'll just leave.

'Cause he's definitely got it on him.
So what's the holdup?
I'm actually glad that you asked.
Now, you see, a couple of days ago, somebody broke into my warehouse, and they stole half a dozen of my best 50 cals.
Yo, that's crazy, man.
- That got nothing to do...

- Let me finish.

So what I did is I asked around.
I said, "Anybody know anything?
Anybody hear anything?"
And you know what?

And you know what they heard?
They heard that your boy Tico here was going around shooting his mouth off about this big score that he had just made.
Right?

Then I...

How bad is business, Tico?
Huh?
Was it so tough that you would do something so stupid as to try to make a buck by stealing from me?
Hunter, listen, man, I...
Calm yourself, pretty boy.
All right, all right, here comes the next burst.
Ada, play speed times four.
Murphy, we're reviewing it now.
All good so far.
Guys, we might have a problem here.
Play speed normal.
...by stealing from me?
This thing's going sideways, Brandt's in trouble.
Get in there.

We're on our way.
- Nothing in here.

We never saw Hunter leave, so we need to shut off the exits, get all units out here to search out the garage.
No, Brandt's not in the garage anymore.
He had this in his pocket.
He must have left it here for a reason.
Look, tire marks.
Hunter already switched the cars.
They took him, Gideon.

Okay, everyone, we have an officer missing and our job is to do everything we can to get him back.
Ada, you ready for the next contact with Brandt?
20 seconds out from a transmission.
A total of 32 cars have exited the garage since Brandt went in.
I could send an "all-call,"
- but they can't handle that many cars.

You don't have a GPS on That thing?
He was going to one parking garage, we didn't need it.
When the next burst comes in, we can triangulate Brandt's signal.
Waiting for the "I told you so."
That's not how I roll, Mr. Reeves.
When something goes wrong, we're all in it together.
- Five seconds.

All right, get ready to triangulate.
We need his location.

No, no, no, no, no.
- Damn it, Ada!

I can't get a read on him.
They're three-second transmissions.
I can barely get anything.
I can try again in seven minutes.
Shh, shh.

- I can't see a damn...

You're making a mistake, man.
We'll talk later.

Take it back.
That last part.
Hear that rumble?
That's the El.
There can't be that many tracks in that neighborhood.
Okay, I'm enlarging the map.
Murphy, he's-he's near the El.
They've got Brandt in a car, the camera's totally blocked so we can't see anything.
But we can hear.
How long ago did they pass it?
About three minutes.
- Okay, there's an El that crosses at...

Just hang on, Brandt.

Officers Murphy, Cobb, and I were pursuing the suspect north on Hobsen when we lost him down an alley.
Gideon's, you know, drone thing picked up his trail.
Led us here.
Was it any more difficult to work in the presence of a drone?
Well, it surprised the hell out of us, that's for sure.
Yeah, I bet.
Did the drone also lead you up the stairs where you were shot, or was that your decision?
He's headed upstairs.
And where exactly was the suspect when you were shot?
The next floor.
The weapon Mr. Reeves had issued the department, it's got two modes, right?

Yeah, that's correct.
Did that gun feel comfortable to you when you fired the shot?
Officer Reyes?
Officer Reyes, are you okay to continue?
I'm sorry, I...
I got to get some air.
Everything okay out here?
Yeah.
I just...
The memories came back stronger than I thought.
Is there anything I can do to help?
No.
No, I just...
I needed to catch my breath.
You been experiencing a lot of this anxiety since the incident?
Not before you brought me back here.
Well, you know, if you'd like to file a grievance,
I'd be happy to help.
I don't need any help.
You're the one who wanted to take a walk down memory lane.
So if Hunter stayed straight there...
He wouldn't, there's sewer repairs.
That whole block is a cluster.
Yeah, a guy like Hunter would know that.
Well, where would a right turn take him?
Past the 16th District, which he would also avoid like the plague.
So left would be his best bet.
Okay, guys, if we take the time we heard
Hunter start his engine, and then we estimate how long it would take for his car to reach the exit, then this is what you get.
That's got to be Hunter's vehicle.
He's headed north on Sixth.
That's in line with the El.
Murphy, got the car.
Can you do anything about traffic?
I mean, yeah, I guess I could try to trigger red lights from here.
All right.
We stopped traffic northbound on Sixth.
Looking for that.
Got it.
We'll set up at the end of Eighth and we'll work down.

Yeah.
1312 in pursuit.
What about Brandt?

Okay, we're receiving a transmission now.
Oh, my God.
What's going on?
What is it?
We're too late.
They aren't on the road anymore.
Where's Brandt?
No, no.
Gideon, I need a location.
Where is Brandt?
All right, everyone in the station listen up.
We got a serious situation.
Our undercover operation went bad.
Officer Brandt is now missing.
Be prepared to jump in as needed.
This case is your case now, too.
Gideon?
We're trying to track down Officer Brandt.
Unfortunately, the same thing that made his surveillance equipment hard for the bad guys to find is making it hard for us to find him.
We are working the problem and I promise you we won't stop until Brandt is safe.
If you're the praying kind, now's the time to put in a good word for your fellow officer.
While you're at it, pray for a better G.S.M. localization protocol.
Gideon.
Hmm?

Do you?
What?

Yes, Murphy, I understand.
If, uh... if we don't find Brandt, then, um... whatever happens is on me.
No.
See, that's not how this works.
I'm the lead on this, so just listen to me.
Do you remember how you felt when your friend Sully died in that liquor store?
Right before you came to us?
Every cop in the 13th District is a Sully to me.
Even the ones I don't even like.
You're here, you bleed blue.
Period.
So this isn't just on you.
It's on us.
We'll find him together.
Okay?
Now, gentlemen we are gonna have a real talk about my missing guns.
Okay?
Hunter, come on, man.
You...

You got to believe me.
That's the thing, Tico,
I don't believe you.
So what was that story that you were going around town, talking about the big score?
I-I was just building up the business.
I... it was just talk, you know, people want a winner.
Yeah.

You fake it till you make it, right?

Tico's marketing skills could use some help, you know.
Whoa!

Just cool off.
You know, we could figure this out.
Really?

I'll help you find out what happened.
Well, actually, you already did.
Tico, listen to me.
I'm gonna ask you more time.
And I want you to answer me honestly.
You're gonna tell me where my guns are.
He doesn't know anything!
How you like your fingers, Tico?
You think you need all of them?

- Okay, okay.

Please stop.

No, you didn't, Tico.

They're at my place, man.
- They're at your place?

Okay.
Now, Tico,
I just have one more question for you.
How'd you know where I had 'em?
Come on.

With Brandt stationary, it should be easier to triangulate his position.
Yeah, in theory, maybe, but I don't control the location of the cell phone towers.
In order to get a good lock on him, we need three.
We have two.
Location-wise, that leaves us with this.
Well, that's not too far from here.
Yeah, the area's too big.
There's no way we can knock on all those doors.
Well, then, we have to be able to narrow it down.
No, not without more data.
- Gideon, I'm sorry, but I just don't...

We'll find a way.
I just...

We need another cell phone tower.
Well, we need... we need another cell phone tower.
We need a...
We need another cell phone tower.
What are you doing?
We've got to find Brandt.
To do that, I need this radio.
Ready?

All right.
Where you keep the pi boards?
Uh, uh, in the orange case.
What are you building?
It's like a stingray.
Mimics a cell tower.
I know what a stingray is.
Well, then stop asking questions and watch the road.
Well, you're gonna need a bigger power supply, that's what I'm saying.
It's on the bottom shelf.
- Ah, jeez.

You need serious help with your organizational skills.
How close are we to being within range of Brandt's transmitter?
Not close enough.
Okay, okay, just stop, please, please.
Now, Tico,
I'm getting real tired of this.
It was him.
He told me.
He's lying.
- What did he tell you?

Shut up.
Tico, what did he tell you?
Places.
Places.

Places, uh, where-where you see...
Tico...
Hey, I said keep your mouth shut.
Tico?
How does this son of a bitch know anything about me?
They got surveillance, man.
He's a...
He's a what?
He's a cop, man!
He's a cop.
A cop?
He's scared.
What do you think he's gonna say?
Think about it.
It's the truth, man.
I-I don't want to lie anymore.
They booked me.
He said that if I cooperated, then they would drop charges.
Tico, it's okay.
Now I just got one more question for you.
You have my guns, right?
They're at your place?
- Yeah.

- Every single one, every single one.

I got to tell you, man, for a cop to walk in here without wearing a wire...
Buddy, you are either incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid.
What are you doing?

We need to get ghost like now.
- I got this.

Don't make this any worse than it is.
You know what we're gonna do?
You're gonna tell me everything that the cops know about me.
And we're gonna start at the beginning, and please keep in mind what happens to people who lie to me.
Okay.

Yeah.
I found out about you from my partner, Ryder.
Hank Ryder.

Doesn't ring a bell.
You sure?
Hank Ryder.
That name should mean something to you.
Okay, I've never heard of it, so here's what we're gonna do.

You're gonna start telling me something that I actually want to hear.
You understand?
Ada, getting this?
Yeah, I see you.

So, when the data comes in, we should be able to pinpoint his location.
I'm on it.
All right.

Just look for the blip.
Yeah, Gideon, I know.

I got him!

Okay, he looks like he's on the corner of Elwood and Eighth.
It looks like an old warehouse.
All right, everybody, move in.

Be careful.
I repeat, be careful.
1309 en route.
Let's go get our boy.
Come on!
Conrad, we're at the scene.
What's the situation?
All right, folks, here's what we know.
Brandt's been made.
He's stalling.
Keeps talking about an old partner.
Hank Ryder.
He can't stall forever.

I think the loading dock is our best bet.
I'll grab a flashbang,
I'll clear the lot, you take the corner.
- Let's go.

That name, Hank Ryder.
Brandt is not just stalling.
He's talking to us, to me.
When Brandt and I were rookies, there was a burglary at Ryder Market.
Meth head named Hank holed up inside with a shotgun.
Shot clear through the rolling doors out front.
The loading dock, it's the same kind of door.
Brandt's telling us that we can't go through it.
We need to find another way.
The guy is being tortured.
We start poking around, we're gonna get made.
Gideon, we need another entry point.
Way ahead of you.

Don't be stupid.
Just call the 13th District, and tell them you want to make a deal.
Hell, with all of Gideon Reeves' money, you could make out like a bandit.
Shut up.
God, I'm so tired of hearing your mouth.
Are you crazy?
We cannot just kill a cop.
Why the hell not?
Because we don't want that type of heat.
We already got that kind of heat.
What, do you think they're gonna give you a pass after you kidnapped him and tied him to a chair?
Come on, man, you heard him.

There's no deal.
We got a body on the ground.
The cop's got to go.
I got your entry point.
No suspects identified.
Gideon, we could use a little help here.
He's in the next room to your right, Murphy, hurry.
They're gonna kill him.
Be smart, Hunter.

You keep me alive, you got leverage.
I think you watch too many movies.
Police!

Drop it.
- You all right?

Find the necklace?
I think you should get one of these.
Nice work.
Morning, everybody.
Uh, before we get our day started,
I would just like to say a few words.
It's no secret that I run a technology empire.
And because I spend so much of my time in the company of robots and computers and nanotech devices, people sometimes think that I don't care much about humans.
But here's the thing.
My company started with manned space flight.
And when you put a rocket into space, it's not about going as far or as fast as you can go.
That's not hard.
What's hard is making sure everybody comes home.
Yesterday was not a victory for technology.
Was the technology excellent?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was.
We are literally the only police department in the entire world with a $2 million jacket hanging in our closet.
Right?
But the real victory belongs to all of you.
Ada did not let one kilobyte pass her desk without a fight.
Conrad, you helped us cut through the noise, and listen to what really mattered.
Detective Murphy, between those transmissions, when our screen went dark, you somehow managed to see what nobody else could.
And Officer Brandt, a lesser man would have buckled.
And we are glad you're home.
Glad to be home, boss.
Just so you know, you still cannot keep the jacket.
Hey, uh, sir?
Yeah?
I read your report.
I need to make some changes.
Changes?
We went through it, you signed off.
Yeah, I know, but, um, I made some mistakes, uh, remembered some stuff.
Come with me.
Did someone pressure you to change your story?
No, no.

Look, I know that this has been very hard for you, but right now I just need the truth.
Well, the truth is, it wasn't Gideon's fault... or his technology.
Are you telling me the tech had nothing to do with you getting hurt?
It was all you?
Yeah.

I'd never been in a situation like that before, and I got rattled.
Get this back to me when you're ready.
Scott, what are you really doing here at the 13th?
My job.
Since when is it the ASA's job to railroad a rookie into serving a political agenda?
I'm gonna let that one slide.
Just level with me.

The mayor asked me to come here.
I know.
Okay, but just because you're doing your job doesn't mean that you're doing the right thing.
What's so right about a smooth-talking rich guy who's patting himself on the back for almost getting a cop killed?
It's not like that.
He's helping cops do their jobs.
