Previously on "Stitchers"...
Stinger must be using a digital avatar he created of you as a kid to pull Kirsten deeper into her own mind.
Ivy ran the anomaly on us.
We know you've been in touch with Stinger.

- No!

And when we are done, you get to complete the rescue mission you started with your father all those years ago and finally pull your mother out of her endless sleep.
You can't help me if you're stuck in here.
- What kinda dream was it?

Not since I was a little girl.
The more intimate you guys are, the more it's gonna mess with your ability to stitch.
How long you gonna keep this up for?
As long as it takes for you to work up a damn oxytocin filter.
- Who's on the other end picking our cases?

I mean, I could talk to them.

Get Kirsten's mom out of that damn cryogenic tank she's cooped up in.
And where exactly does Kirsten see Jacqueline Stinger cooped up?
- Where's my mother?

I'm going to arrange for you to see her,
- but I need a few days.

- What's that?

- a working oxytocin filter.

- Morning.

- What you doing?

- About last night?

Your m...

It wasn't that bad, was it?
No.
Not at all.

I'm excited to find out where she is, even more excited to think I might save her.
Yeah, and thanks to Linus, we can finally be together.
Mm-hmm.
You know, I knew being his friend would pay off one day.
And he's a really good friend.
He's the best.
Camille?
Shh.
I'm having a beautiful dream I don't want to wake up from.
I need to ask you something.
Am I gonna like it?
I don't know.
Okay.
Until yesterday,
I basically assumed we weren't gonna work out.
- What's her name?

- It's not like that.

It's not like that either.
I, um...
I think we should move in together.
Wow.

You're not worried it's too soon to become a U-Haul couple?
I wasn't until you just said that.
I think that's just about the best thing I've heard in weeks.
Really?
Come over and kiss me, find out.
Something is going on.
Is it that obvious?
What?

- Kirsten:

That's the guy you blackmailed to find out where your mom is?
Uh-huh.
What the hell is this?
It's a military escort.
Who handles the case briefings?
Um, that'd be me.
Do you know how to use a tablet computer?
Is that a joke?
Be prepared to brief your team on case file
Hotel-Mike-Sierra 03-0-600, in 20 minutes.
Cameron.
(quietly) Time to see if Linus's oxytocin filter really works.
Camille:

An American hero.
Ms. Nichols was a NASA mathematician in the early '70s.
She worked on a variety of high-level secretive projects.
She retired in 1992 and died of natural causes in her home.
Why is she here?
Ms. Nichols had a spare room in her home that seems to be... impregnable.
No visible lock.

Scans indicate the walls are made of metal a foot thick.
- Metal?

Walls, ceiling and floor.

I mean, it could be a Faraday cage.
Electromagnetic shield?
Something in there she wants to protect.
Admiral Decker.
Who was Denise Nichols?
Denise Nichols picked the stitch cases.
She's here because we have to find out how she did it.
The answer is in that room.
(theme song playing)
♪ Take me inside ♪
♪ Take me inside ♪
Um, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Um, my mind is going a thousand miles a minute.
The secret to how our cases are picked might actually be right in front of us, right now.
Yes, uh, actually, I was going with the "I really hope this oxytocin filter works"
flavor of excitement, but, um...
Are you sorry that we, you know?
God...

But this might be the biggest stitch we've ever stitched.
- It's gonna be fine.

From your lips to the quantum computer's ears.
(groans)
(phone warbling)
- What do you want, Ivy?

- Very much.

- That's not gonna happen.

One last time.
(sighs)
Okay.

(phone beeps)
Cameron:

I need a go, no-go for stitch neurosync.
- Life Sci?

- Sub Bio?

- Engineering?

- Communications?

- Medical?

- Comm check.

Okay.

Let's pay a visit to the oracle.
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.
In three, two, one.
- Mark.

- Um...

It's foggy.
I'm seeing an elevated oxytocin level.
- Oxytocin?

Linus, I thought you told me you had this fixed.
Brain volume shrinks with age.

Why are Kirsten's oxytocin levels spiking?
Maybe Ms. Nichols had a hot date.
She's 84 years old.
Sounds like my kind of woman.
Linus, can you crank the oxytocin filter?
Turning it up to 11 as we speak.
Try now.
It's still not great.
I think I've mapped the memory of the bedroom/Faraday box room.
Okay, stand by, Kirsten.
We're moving you to outside the bedroom.
Okay, um... at the door.
It's, uh, metal.
No visible lock.

Open hailing frequencies.
(electronic voice) Voice command, acknowledged.
(door opens)
The door is voice-activated.
It responds to "Open hailing frequencies."
Star Trek, original series.
- And the movie.

We know what phrase she used.
But it only responds to her voice.
Miss Clark's got to go inside.
Okay, Nyota, we're moving ya.
I'm in.
But this fogginess is really intense.
I can't see.
Cameron, get this under control now.
I am trying.

Work with me.
She's reading an e-mail.
Cameron:

Uh, okay, um...
"Relative location of asset.
18, 23, 7, 91."
Asset?

I can't make it out.
- (gasps)

- I'm bouncing.

- You okay?

Like hell you are.
That stitch was a mess from start to finish.
And why did you bounce so quickly?
- I think the problem was...

Her oxytocin levels are through the roof.
What were the two of you thinking?
We don't need your permission to be together.
And besides, Linus worked up an oxytocin filter.
Which didn't work because we've never stitched into a subject that old before.
You risked everything that you worked for.
- You risked saving your mother.

The e-mail I saw Denise reading was about terminating my mother.
That is not going to happen.
I saw the e-mail.

Because it's me telling you it's not going to happen.
That is all I can say about this.
Now what we need to do is wait out the refractory period, and then try to stitch into Denise again.
(door closes)
Do you believe her?
I don't know what to believe.
But there is something else.
The numbers that I saw in the stitch, they were about the location of the asset.
They have to do with where my mother is.
Well, did you see anything that could explain how she picked the stitch cases?
No.

I have to get in there and take a closer look.
How?

Maybe I missed something, something that I'll remember if I'm there.
Okay.
Go with Fisher.

Look, in no way am I sorry about what happened between us last night.
I hope you're not either, okay?
(door opens)
(door closes)
It's here.
Yeah.
Okay.
No lock.

No hidden mechanisms I can see.
Yeah, I don't see anything familiar.
What was that phrase she used?
Open hailing frequencies.
- (beeps)

Maybe I wrote it down wrong.
No.

It only works when Denise says "Open hailing frequencies."
Voice command acknowledged.
(mechanical whirring)
Okay.
(electronic beeping)
Denise must have programmed the door to recognize not only her vocal pattern, but also mine.
It's like she knew I'd come here.
Well, she picked our cases, so, clearly, she knew a lot.
Look at this little nugget of history, huh?
Wait.
I've seen these before, from an old case.
These are the algorithms for stitching.
Anything in there about how she picked our cases?
No.

But I know someone who might.
So, what do you think?

It's definitely them.
They seem to indicate an exchange of data.
Either she was tracking Kirsten during stitches or...
Or maybe she was tracking my progress mapping the brain.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if she was tracking how much brain we still needed to map, wouldn't that just be how she chose the cases?
Maybe.

(watch beeping)
I-I gotta go.
But, uh, you can I, we can work on this later.
- Um...

- Uh, do you have a minute?

Of course, what's up?
So, um...
I just want to let you know,
I'm gonna be moving out.
Wait.

- You're leaving?

Just the house.
Amanda and I are...

But you barely know her.
Well, I'm not gonna know her any better not living with her.
Are you sure this isn't gonna be a mistake?
What if Cameron asked you to live with him and I said you were making a mistake?
I would say you're being a concerned friend.
And I appreciate that you care.
I do.
But I need this.
I'll miss you.
I think you'll be okay.
(doorbell rings)
I came.

Please... come in.
No.

Linus.
Please.
Is crying on command something you got from your father, or is that a trick you learned on your own?
What I feel is not a game.
It isn't a lie.
I know that you don't understand everything that's happening right now, but you will.
And soon.
Please.
I need a friend right now.
You know, I'm all alone!
My father found out the NSA's planning to terminate Jacqueline Stinger.
What?
He's going crazy trying to find her before they kill her.
Wait, how did you find this out?
I used your NSA account to hack into Maggie's e-mails.
- No, Linus, I...

Just stop.
Never call me again,
- and never speak to me again.

Thanks.
(sighs)
- How you holding up?

I thought they would lead to my mom, but now, I don't know.
Are they...

No.

Unless the NSA moved my mother to Paris, or Beijing, or Botswana, then no.
- Botswana?

- (door opens)

Sorry.

Don't worry about it.

Listen, Kirsten...
Ivy stole my credentials and hacked into Maggie's computer.
She shared some e-mails with your father.
The NSA's gonna kill your mother.
I saw that same e-mail in the stitch.
Okay.

Well, Maggie speaks the language of CIA spooks, aka, lies.
But... every government agency has its own language.
And before she worked for the NSA,
Denise Nichols was an engineer at NASA.
What would a mathematician, like Denise, do at NASA in the 1970s?
She calculated trajectories.
I don't think the NSA is gonna send your mom into space.
But they did move her.
From Point A, where we know she used to be, to Point B.
So you think these numbers track where your mom got moved?
We may not know how she picked the stitch cases, but I think Denise Nichols gave us a way to find my mom.
Okay.

Linus, take these algorithms back to the lab.
See what you can find out about 'em.
What are you guys gonna do?
Plot a trajectory.
(Cameron sighs)
Yes.

I didn't say anything.
I can tell what you're thinking.
Oh, that's a scary superpower in a girlfriend.
Okay, so, here's the plan.

We'll tell them that... you're pregnant.
You're going into labor.

Oh!

If that was even remotely plausible.
Okay.

We should just tell them that we work for a secret branch of the NSA and that we hack into the memories of the dead.
You love telling people that.
(sighs)
Good afternoon, Officer.

Kirsten Clark?
Yes.
Commander Nichols said you'd be coming.
Wait.
Denise Nichols?
Pull through the gate.
Take any open spot.
- That works too.

What is this place?
From the looks of it, an old munitions factory.
(gasps)
Mom.
(air hissing)
Stinger:

Dr. Goodkin.
Last time I saw you, you were just a little boy.
I'm glad you could be here for our family reunion.
You're not my family.
Well, it's not just me, sweetheart.
There's your mother, and... of course, your sister.
You are such a bitch.
Stinger:

We can finish that mission we started when you were a little girl.
I can't believe you came here with him.
- It's okay.

I didn't come here alone.
Maggie:

You set me up?
I told you to stay away from me.
You created this story, that Jacqueline would be terminated to bring me out of hiding?
So, my mom, she's okay?
She's fine.

Gladly.
(gunfire)
Cameron:

(gunfire)
(hissing)
- No!

Kirsten!
Stop!

- Stop!

Don't shoot!
I give up.
(alarm beeping)
- What the hell were you thinking?

Life support's failing.
Can it be fixed?
I don't know.
She's gonna die.
I didn't come all this way to lose her now.
She looks exactly the way she did when we started on the Stitchers program all those years ago.
She's so young.
She's beautiful.
Jacqueline's brain function is low but nominal.
So?
Can I stitch into her?
Stitching broke her.

Your mother is alive, but with the brain function of someone who's been in stasis condition for years.
There's no user manual for this one.
I-I stitched into Cameron, and he was still alive.
He was clinically dead.
We're in a new world here.
Can I stitch into her or not?
Yes.

Your oxytocin levels are off the chart right now.
I mean, you are basically in the worst possible condition you could be in to stitch.
Well, either I stitch now and try to save her, or I do nothing and watch her die.

I'll push the oxytocin filter as far as it can go and then some.
Cameron:

- Thank you.

Kirsten, you've got no choice, but I've got no margin for error.
If I send you down the wrong neural pathway, it could shut down her brain activity forever.
We've really only got one shot to get this right.
Okay.
Cameron... you've never stitched into a living person before, but there is someone who has.
My father.
No.

The last time Stinger stitched you into your mother it put her in a coma, you almost died, and it left you with temporal dysplasia.
That's why you need him, so you don't make his same mistakes.
I am not letting him anywhere near this.
Come on, please.

That's what I'm afraid of.
(beeping)
I'm so sorry for everything I put you through.
Just as you and I were starting to get close,
I had to push you away... because of my father.
And to keep you safe, I couldn't be honest with you.
I just hope, one day, you'll be able to fully forgive me.
How about over dinner sometime?
- I would like that.

I gotta go.
Admiral Decker wants to debrief me.
Okay.
Don't let anything happen to my sister.
Hello, Kirsten.
Give us a moment.
I know you hate me.
Hate you?
Do you know how many lives you've ruined?
Just listen to me for a minute.
I can listen to you.
I just can't trust anything you say.
And that's exactly why I reached out to you through the avatar of young Cameron.
So you would trust me the way you trust him.
Cameron and I have a plan to save Mom.
- But...

- and Cameron's afraid to do it.

He's cautious.
Mom could die.
And that's why you should let me pilot the stitch.
Nope.

If anything, your role would be purely advisory.
That's less desirable.
I thought you'd do anything to save Mom.
I guess I was wrong.
Wait a minute.
If you let me direct the stitch,
I don't have a problem with Cameron being on the controls... as long as he does everything I say.
I won't let your mother die.
Okay.
But if this is a set-up...
I will kill you myself.
That's my girl.
(door closes)
Stinger's in.

Swell.
On one condition.

No.
No conditions.

Please, Cameron.
Please, work with him.
Okay.
Thank you.

You know, he won't let my mother die.

She's not the one I'm worried about.
(sighs)
See you soon, Mom.
You ready?
She looks like Sleeping Beauty.
Camille:

Impressive.
It's exciting to see where you've taken my work.
Oh, this stopped being your work a long time ago.
You're in my lab now.
In here, you're an outsider.
It's the story of my life.
Let's bring her home, hmm?
You sure you can handle this?
Just keep eyes on Stinger.
Yep.
I swear, you try and pull anything...
Yeah.

No.

Lights to 20 percent, please.
I need a go, no-go for stitch neurosync.
- Life Sci?

Sub Bio.
Sub Bio?
I'm seeing something strange here.
It's a structure of some kind, like a... like a mass near her brain stem.
What kind of mass?
Is it a tumor?
No, it seems bio-mechanical.
Like a... hybrid structure of some kind.
Let me see.
- It's fine.

I said it's fine.
Cameron, we don't have time to argue about this.
Okay, let's continue.
- Sub Bio?

- Noted.

- Communications?

- Medical?

Comm check.

Go.
Okay, induce stitch neurosync on my mark.
In three, two, one.
- Mark.

I can't see much.
Communications, report.
I can't get a lock on neurosync.
Jacqueline's mind's rejecting the sync.
- Let's get her out of there.

- Hey, you okay?

How's my mom?
No significant changes.
She's stable but transitioning.
- Then let's try again.

Let's try again.
I don't think we should.

We have no other choice.
It's backwards.
What?
The host and the client are inverted.
We need to switch 'em.
Are you insane?
Maybe... but I'm also right.
Camille:

He wants to put Jacqueline in the tank and Kirsten in the corpse cassette.
- No way.

Because we don't know what being in the corpse cassette will do to her.
Or don't you care?
Jacqueline's always been your first priority.
Never Kirsten.

You're not thinking scientifically.
Scientifically?

That's called physics.
(grunting)
You son of a bitch.

Come here, come here!
- Stop it!

- How's that feel?

I'm asking how it felt when you channeled all that emotional energy towards me, and then I redirected it back to you?
Oh, my God.

What do you mean?
You and your mom are both still alive.
This stitch isn't about the tech.

It's about the emotional energy.
If we put your mother in the tank, and stitch her into you, whatever residual emotional energy she has left will be... will be fired into your brain and redirected back at her, so that means...
That means all that love that you've been carrying around for her for all these years... with one emotional burst of energy, we could wake her up.
No.

It's too risky not to.
- You sure you want to do this?

Hey.

Don't look at me like that.
- Like what?

- Seal me in.

Yes.
Okay.
(whispers) I love you.
I know.
Well played.
(sighs)
- You'll be on an open channel.

You'll be able to hear everything that's going on, okay?
- You won't be alone.

(sighs)
Good.

If Kirsten's love is gonna save her mother, then your love is gonna save her.
Lights to 20 percent, please.
Mission clock is running.

- Life Sci?

- Sub Bio?

- Engineering?

- Communications?

- Medical?

Okay, people, induce stitch neurosync on my mark.
In three, two, one.
- Mark.

(distorted scream)
(echoing):

My head feels like it's exploding.
I'm seeing vasodilation in the cranial blood vessels.
- (rapid beeping)

Her body temp's too high.
We have to lower the temp inside the cassette as if there's a corpse in there.
I hate to say this, but he's right.
Do it.
Do it.
Cameron:

I can take it.
I know you can.

Brain activity's back to normal.
- Synapses stabilizing.

She looks fine, but...
- But what?

Very similar to when Jacqueline was in there.
What are you seeing?
Alex, zoom in on Kirsten's brain stem.
Looks normal.
Go deeper.
Cameron, is that the same thing that's on Jacqueline's brain stem?
I don't know.

But not a reflection.
It's a cluster of nanobots that I infused into her brain when I tried to stitch her into her mother as a child.
- Oh, my God.

It's how the technology worked back then.
That's why she can't remember her own dreams.
Cameron?

It's connected.
You, your mother, Denise Nichols.
- You're all connected.

It all makes sense.
The algorithm that Denise's computer used to pick the stitch cases is tuned to Kirsten's brain and the mapping we accomplished.
The computer would get LAPD homicide reports and then narrow all those crimes down to a few candidates for stitching.
So, how did Denise pick each specific case?
She didn't.
Kirsten did.
The data arrays that Kirsten found at Denise's... they show an exchange of data, not in one way, but in both ways.
To and from the nanobot cluster in Kirsten's brain.
(shivering):

We said crunching the data would require more power than a quantum computer.
The human brain is the most powerful computer of all.
Jacqueline has a similar structure in her brain.
Quantum entanglement.
That means they should be able to communicate on a quantum level.
"You can't help me if you're stuck in here."
That... that was my mother talking to me.
When we stitch again, we just have to reopen that channel.
Great.

Okay, just hold on, Kirsten.

In three, two, one.
- Mark.

Kirsten, how you holding up?
Cold.
I can't see anything yet.
Okay, Kirsten, listen to me.
I need you to focus in on all that love you have.
All the love that you have for your mother, your friends, for me.
I want you to channel every bit of love and emotion that you've stored inside of your brain ever since you lost that temporal dysplasia, you hear me?
- (shivering)

You're going to channel all of that... into your mother.
I see her.
It's time to come home.
Yeah.
Ayo:

- Cameron?

Now.
Ayo, brain function!
Coming to normal.
Jackie.
Jackie, sweetheart.
You're gonna be okay.
Kirsten.
- Kirsten, you did it.

You're here.
Kirsten, you're safe, okay?
You're home.
I will never leave you.
Get Dr. Marian Goodkin down here ASAP.
- Right away.

Come on.

Okay?
Help me get her out of here!
So?
Well, your mother reviewed Kirsten's EEG.

No traumatic brain injury.
What aren't you telling us?
Kirsten doesn't remember anything.
About what happened to her?

- Maybe that's a good thing?

(sighs)
Whatever happened to Kirsten while in the corpse cassette affected the latter part of her longterm memory.
Now, your mother is gonna run some more tests, but Kirsten's memories from the last two or three years are compromised.
She doesn't remember anything about the Stitchers program.
She doesn't remember you.
Linus:

I don't know.
Excuse me.
I'm sure she'll get her memory back soon.
Just go talk to her.
- Be with her.

Not now.
Come on, dude, you got to.
No, I don't have to do anything, man.
This is my fault.

You had no choice.
Fisher's right.

No, I had a choice, and this is the choice that I made.
Because Kirsten wanted you to.
Well, it was my call.

But you didn't, so don't beat yourself up over it.
I know, but please, just... leave me alone right now.
- Cameron.

Please.
Are you okay?
You seem really, um, upset at those people.
Are they your friends?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

I'm Cameron.
Something happened to my memory, um... so, I'm a little confused.

When we were kids.
You had heart surgery, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, that was... that was me.
Yeah.

How's your heart?
It hurts a little.
You'll be okay one day.
I promise.
It was nice talking to you, Kirsten.
You too.
I will never forgive you for what you're making me do to him.
