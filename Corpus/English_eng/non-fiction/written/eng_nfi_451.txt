I believe you have something of mine, Robert.
It belongs to neither of us, Bruno.
Humans shouldn't possess this kind of power.
With that, I could have everything I've ever wanted for eternity.
I don't want to live in a world where you can get everything you want.
Give me what's mine.
Sorry, old friend.
This is for your own good.
-Did you get the batteries?

Absolutely.

I kinda got all of them off the Internet.

A homemade time machine that we found on the Internet.
What could possibly go wrong?
In the miraculous off chance that this actually works, where should we send him?
What about back to prehistoric times?
Sure, I like dinosaurs.

Come to think of it, I'd like to be transported back to last week when I agreed to take part in this stupid experiment.
Come on, you guys.

This could be the ultimate adventure.
Okay, here goes.
Wait!

Oh, no!
If I get eaten by a T-Rex, I'm gonna be really, really mad at you guys!
Did it work?
I guess we can chalk up another bust for the Adventure Club.
What a surprise.
I really had high hopes for this one, guys.
Maybe we should give up on this whole Adventure Club thing.
Yeah, maybe we should try something else.
Come on, you guys.

There's got to be adventures out there for us to have.
Really?

Or that there was pirate treasure buried under the school playground?
I think it's time to give up the dream.
Plus I'm out of Pez, my favorite.
Worst day ever.
At least I have Penelope.
It's really disturbing that you call your jalopy Penelope.
She's not a jalopy.

And once I'm finished working on her, she'll be beautiful.
Hey, you okay?
It's getting late.
I better go home.
I do understand your position, but I don't know if you understand mine.
Look, if our funding continues to be cut, we won't have any money to bring any new exhibits in, and it will be impossible for the science museum to turn a profit.
It's a vicious cycle.
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
Okay.

-Well, that didn't sound good.

Hey, sweetheart.

Just hanging out.

Hey, buddy.
Oh, yeah, just some science museum stuff.
You ready for some dinner?

Yeah, and I made it, not your mom.
What is that supposed to mean?
Nothing, dear.
No, thanks.
It's not just any lasagna.

I'm not hungry.
I'll be right back.
Hey, sweetie.
Are you okay?
Can I see?
Aw.

Mom...
Do you think grandpa really went on all those adventures?
Oh, yeah.
He was an archaeologist, sweetheart.

I miss how he'd give me a wet Willy every time I'd see him.
You used to hate those wet willies.
I miss them now.
I know.
He used to always say that one of his most favorite days, ever...
Was the day that you were born.
Do you think I could ever be like him?
Oh, Ricky, you already are like him.
I mean, like, going on adventures and stuff.
Do you remember what granddad used to always say...
That the key to adventure is always right in front of you.
Is the science museum going to close down?
I don't know...
We need to come up with a lot of money before the end of the month.
Grandpa would be sad to hear that.

Yes, he was.
But you know what?

Because I have a town hall meeting this week, and I'm gonna do my very best to convince the municipality to do what's right.
So, I need to you to say a wish for your dear old mama, okay?
'Cause I'm gonna need it.
It's time for you to go to bed now.
I want you to come brush your teeth, okay?
Baby.
I'm proud of you.
The key-- the key to adventure is right in front of me.
Who's there?
Ricky, you scared me.

What are you doing up here?
Uh, nothing.

Okay.
Well... good night.
Clubhouse meeting, first thing tomorrow.
Roger.
Copy that.
I'm telling you, guys, this is it.
This is the one we've been waiting for.
-No, this time it's different.

But this time it really is.
You say that every time, too.
I'm sorry, Ricky, but...
I'm gonna have to take bill's side on this one.

You have to have a majority.
Just hear me out.
I found this hidden in my grandpa's old desk.
Why would he go through the trouble of hiding this if it wasn't something really special?
And I'm the one who found it.
Don't you see?
It's like he left it for me.
I've got a good feeling about this one, guys.
It's not that we don't want to believe you, but-- we don't believe you.
Please, guys...
Just give me this one, at least for this one last time.
And if this turns out to be a bust...
I promise...
I'll let it go...
Forever.
Fine.
I wanna see the map.
You guys are the best.
Well, this is a map, all right.
But it's not of streets.
It looks like some kind of old-fashioned blueprints for a building.
How do we find out what building this is from?
Hey, look.

Shayne Putzlocher?

I've got an idea.
This is way too much like school.
Take a seat.

Putzlocher-

Putzlocher-- ah, Putzlocher.
Shayne Putzlocher, architect.
Uh, "by 1964, the Power Corporation purchased the powerhouse--"
Ah. "The legacy of the powerhouse building was preserved as--"
Our science museum, right here in town.
Of course.

That probably means whatever this key unlocks is in that building.
And these blueprints are for the science museum.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Did you not see the sign that says, "no running".
Where do you think you are, an amusement park?
Don't answer that, son.

You are in a museum of science, a hallowed institution for learned people.
You have to respect this establishment.
Wow.

I'm in security, son.
You always gotta be prepared.
-You're insecure?

-No.

It's me, Ricky.

My mom works here.
Oh, I see.
You're one of those.
one of those kids who thinks they get a free pass in life.
That's your generation.
My generation had to grow up way faster than yours.
You don't know what it's like to have to pay your dues.
Speaking of, you gotta pay the $7.50 admission charge.
Ricky!

Yeah, we thought we'd come by and check out some of the new exhibits.
Well, I'm very happy to hear that.
Curtis, you can let them through.
-Certainly, ma'am.

The youth of today.
What's that?
That is a gyrosphere.
It's a tool that astronauts use to prepare for space flight.
Yeah, you may think so, but you will not catch me anywhere near that thing.
Just looking at it throws me off my equilibrium.
My mom hates any kind of amusement park ride.
Remember what happened when we were at Wonderland, and I convinced you to go on the space coaster with me?
Sweetheart, we don't talk about that.
Barf-o-rama.
All right, listen, I've got to get back to work.

-Okay.

-Bye, mom.

Okay, let's put these blueprints to use and see what we can find.
Um, so what are we looking for?
There has to be something.
Come on, grandpa.

What's this over here?
A room.

Below us on the main level.
I've been here a thousand times...
And there's no room there.
You're right.

These blueprints show the exact layout of this entire building, and according to this, there should be a room right here.
Why would a room be walled off?
Because it's a secret room.
Where else would you keep a hidden treasure but in a secret room?
How do we get in there?
I don't know.
We can't just do it in the middle of the day.
Because that's illegal, and I don't know about you guys, but I can't go to jail.
For starters, I'm claustrophobic, and I look terrible in orange.
We don't need to break in.

He can just borrow the security key.
I'm not a lawyer, but this distinctly sounds like something that would land us in deep trouble if we get caught.
Then we don't get caught.
The museum closes at 7:00.
Let's meet here just before 8:00 P.M.
Done.
Fine.
All right, boys.

What'd you make, mom?
Paella.
I think.
You know, sweetie, it was really nice to see you guys today.
You haven't been coming down lately.
We thought we'd just pass by for a visit.
I was surprised you had the energy.
Why?
Okay, you know what?

It's okay.

I woke up in the middle of the night, and I found this guy rummaging around the den.
-Really?

And what were you doing up there?
I was just looking through some of grandpa's old things.
- Did you find anything cool?

He's convinced that his granddad wasn't just an archaeologist, but an incredible explorer that found magical artifacts.
-Like Dr. Jones.

Grandpa is not Dr. Jones.
I found something last night of his that will prove everyone wrong.
Well, you are definitely your granddad's grandson, that's for sure.
So what'd you find?
I don't know yet, but something big.
I can feel it.
All right, Mr. tall teller of tales, that's enough.
I want to enjoy this delicious dinner.
Dig in.
-I'll order pizza.

I guess you should stick to the cooking from now on.
Don't beat yourself up.

-It is.

Your toast usually involves the fire alarm, so yeah, maybe you were right.
Maybe I should stick to the cooking from now on.
No, I'm serious.

For the moment.
I have no doubt that you are going to be the hottest real estate agent around in no time at all.
Well, let's hope so.
It's hard to adjust to a new town.
Well, you're not on the mean streets of Cleveland anymore.
And we prairie folk, we take a while to warm up to people.
'Cause I seem to recall winning you over pretty quickly.
Well, there's always an exception to the rule.
Lucky for me.
He really likes you.
Who, Ricky?

He is.
And you're a great guy.
And this feels really nice.
What?
Like we're a family.
Do you want some ice cream?

Sure.
-Hey.

-I'm gonna get some ice cream.

You know, it looks like we're out of ice cream.

Really?

Martin?
Martin!
All the world's a stage...
And all the men and women play their parts.
There are exits.

And one man in his time plays many parts.
Hi.
You know, when I ran the drama club at the state pen,
I fell in love with the craft of acting.
When an actor really gets into his part, it is-- it just, it gave me goosebumps.
Kinda like what I'm getting from you, right now, watching you.
But you went to like a whole other level.
You-- you've gone method, my friend.
What are you talking about, Langley?
You're really falling for her, aren't you?
What's her name?

I have not fallen for her.
I hope not 'cause that would really endanger our mission, wouldn't it?
Yeah, I know.

I had to make sure that you were still following through with our deal.
Of course I'm following through with our deal!
You do not get snippy with me!
Remember, I took the fall.
- I went to prison.
You got to go free.

-I did-- -you owe me.

And I will rat on you.
You're right.

So... what news?
The kid found something, said it belonged to his grandfather.
I'll find out more information.
Well, good.

My father spent his whole life trying to get it back, and he died in squalor, begging for assistance from anyone.

I'm on it.
I hope so, 'cause I'd hate to recast you.
Not from the top, though, from that last line, your last line. "I'm on it."
'Cause I didn't really believe it, and I wanna feel it.
Will you try it again for me?
I'm on it.
How about just like something with a little more feeling, a little more bang.
I'm on it!
They're not gonna be able to hear you as they come in.

Guess what, we got a back row.

I'm on it!
Don't you feel that?

Goosebumps.
And scene.
You got the key, right?
Yep.
Let's do this.
It's not working.
Maybe it's the other way around.
Let me see it.
This is a yoga membership card.
It is?
Dude, you've gotta be kidding me!
They both look very similar.

You had one job!
Well, I guess we have to go home now.
-Not yet.

It's a key code descrambler I've been working on.
Found the instructions online.
Thought it might come in handy when we're late for school, and they lock us out.
-Does it work?

Right this way, gentlemen.
Nice save, Sandy.
Curtis goes on his rounds at the top of every hour.
Which is right...
Now.
We have to be in and out in 30 minutes.
Psst.
So, how do we open it?
I've got an idea.
Open sesame!
What?

Well, there's got to be a lever, or a switch, or something.
Well, at least we tried, right?
Let's go home.
There's definitely something behind here.
Huh.

You're like royalty around here.
Key.
"The key to adventure is right in front of you."
We're not going in there...
Are we?
This is the point of no return.
Well, then I guess we'd better get going.
And how is this a good idea?
What is this thing?
I don't know.
I think it's an elevator.
Where are we going?
I don't know.
This must be my grandpa's clubhouse.
Just like the one we have.
Do you know the combination?
It's gotta be a significant number for your grandfather.
Do you know his birthday?
It's may 21st...
But I don't know the year.
What was it?
09, 29, 05...
My birthday.
It's just a wooden box.
That's it?

That's why we broke the law this evening?
"True wishes are granted from within."
What do you think it is?
I don't know.
We better get going.
Stealing?
We're stealing now?
Oh, great, another crime.
Hmm.
We're clear.
That was close.
Well, it has to be something important.

And this note.
What does it mean?
I don't know...
But I know who might.
Do you think he's even here?
Of course he's here.

Where else would he be?
Cool.
Ozzie, you in here?
Well.

It's the Adventure Club in the flesh.
Bam.
Zing.
Adventure Club!
So, good to see you guys.
To what do I owe the honor of this little visit?

You want to get a gift.
You need the perfect present for the perfect person who has perfectly everything from this perfect store.
It is the perfect store.
This is our favorite shop.
I know.

My best customers.

They're so invested in those video games.
They don't appreciate old-fashioned knickknacks like I got here.
And smart phones, don't get me started.
Don't.

Dumb phones.

-We need your help.

I'm all ear.

What do you know about boxes?
What do I know about boxes?
Like what, like a toy box, like a shoe box, like a tack box, like a toolbox, like a Jack-in-the- box, like I-could-go-on-forever-box box?

What about an ancient box that was locked away in a safe...
With this note?
That looks really old, Ricky.
Where did you get that parchment?
Ricky?
Huh!

This could be pertaining to a wish box.
-A wish box?

Bill, they are extremely, extremely rare.
What is it?
Follow me, kids.
Wish boxes, wish boxes, wish boxes.
I recall that they were magical devices first used by Sumerian fortune tellers
And I know you kids know that's where the cradle of civilization started, right?
That's where the term "genie in the bottle" originated.
Found it.
Come on, Ozzie, over here.
Okay, table of contents.
Oh, my gosh, 143, 143, 143, 143.
Hang on a minute.
Okay, hang on.
Ready?

"In ancient times, magic wish boxes were believed to Grant wishes to whomever
"was fortunate enough to find it and lay hands upon it.
"Once you had touched the wish box, you were given three wishes.
"These wishes were allowed by simply writing it onto a piece of paper
"and dropping it into the box.

The only catch is wishes will only be granted to the pure of heart."
That's a bummer.

Right?
"During the time in which a person or persons are owed their wishes,
"another party cannot use the wish box unless the possessor wishes the box to be transferred."
Oh, wow.

Isn't history just so amazing, you guys?
Okay, why?

No reason, really.
Just idle curiosity.
Hmm.
Well...
You know what?
If I ever found something that possessed the power of being able to Grant three wishes,
I'm pretty certain I'd put that box back to where I found it, and I would turn around and run or bike away as fast as I could.
But, why?
Because, Billy...

Wish boxes... are so powerful.
I've read about it.

They possess-- they've turned people's minds into crazy, crazy, crazy greed, and greed, and want, and want.
Oh, and there are people out there that will stop at nothing to get their hands on one.
Thanks, Ozzie.
Peace, kids.
A magical wish box?
A magical what?
Well, I'm gonna make it my business.
Seth, scram.
Hey, chill out, Ozzie.

Well, not until you pay for the ones you "picked up" before.
We'll continue this another time.
Hey, my three Adventure Clubbers, remember everything I said.
-Thanks, Ozzie.

Well, I guess we should meet up tomorrow night to get the wish box back into the science museum.
Sounds good.
Wait.

We can't just give up now.
What?

Ozzie is a grownup.

I don't know, dude.

But, that's the risk that every great adventurer takes, and that's who we are.
We're not great adventurers.

We become just like everybody else out there, living boring, normal lives.
One day we'll probably end up like that.
But let's not give in just yet.
Right now, this is our one chance to be different.
We could do something great with it.
Like save the science museum.
We grew up going to that place our whole lives.
It's gave us so much.
This is an opportunity to give something back.
Besides, aren't you curious?
So, three wishes are granted to whoever discovers the box.
But we all found it.
And touched it at the same time.
That means we only have three wishes between us, one each.
I agree.

You know me, always willing to take one for the team.
Okay.

Something realistic, not too crazy.

I've got it!
A lifetime supply of Pez.
You know, for a guy who can come up with some pretty terrible ideas...
Every now and then, you come up with a brilliant one.
Okay, here it goes.
It didn't work.
Give it a moment.

Anything?
Nothing yet.
Anything yet?
Nothing.
How about now?
Still nothing.

Why would my grandpa hide something away that doesn't work?
Maybe there's an expiry date or something.
I gotta get home.

Um, Ricky.
Yeah, go for Ricky.
Uh, I think it worked!
Ha!

Pez!

-Hey, don't you want breakfast?

Oh, Ricky.

Ricky.

Listen, sweetheart, I am giving my speech to the municipality tonight for the science museum, and it would really mean so much to me if you were there, okay?
Sure.
Slow down!
Can you believe it?
What did you do with all of it?
It was good.

I figured if my parents ask, I'll tell them that I entered a contest and won.
Do you guys realize what this means?
Yeah, Pez for life!
It means the wish box works.
We meet again, dorkuses.
That's not the plural of dorkus.

Shut up, brainy.

Sorry, I don't fight girls.
How unfortunate.
Because I'm sick of you science geeks and your dumb Adventure Club.
-We never invited you to be a part of it.

I've got a bad feeling about this.
-Martin.

Hi.

What are you doing in here?
I was just looking for my laptop.
Yeah, I lent it to Ricky, and I thought he might have left it in here.
Oh, he probably left it in his room.

No, no!

Thanks, sweetie.
No problem.
-See ya.

I think this has just been one big, unfortunate misunderstanding.
Why don't we take this opportunity to start fresh?
Can I offer you a complimentary package of Pez?
As a peace offering.
Never mind.
If you have a plan to get out of this, now would be an excellent time to execute.
Nothing really coming to mind.
Enough of this dancing, loser.
Let me down!

Are you doing that?
No, I thought you were.
What are you doing?

It's real.
Ah!

I hope you guys didn't mind me using another wish.
Mind?

Wait, that was your wish you used up...
For me?
We can't keep carrying this thing around with us.

We should leave it in a place where it's gonna be safe.
The clubhouse!
Hey, kid.
You know, I think we can help each other out.
Let's just say I'm the guy who understands your situation.
You don't have many friends 'cause you got a bad rap for being a bully when really you were the one who's excluded and was misunderstood.
And I know exactly how you feel.

Now, you wanna get back at your friends for what they did to you?
I can help you do that.
I'm okay.

You're gonna be fine.

No, but he'll be here.

-Okay.

Thank you.

Hello, everyone, my name is Jane Young, and I'm the director of the science museum.
First of all, I wanna thank you all so much for being here.
As many of you know, there has been major cutbacks to our school systems, and that is one of the reasons, one of the reasons, why it is so important to keep a place like the science museum open.
It is one of the last places that our children can come to learn, and be inspired, and have fun.
Miss Young?

It simply makes no sense to keep this failed institution open.
An institution, I might add, that is costing the hardworking taxpayers of this community hundreds of thousands of dollars each and every year.
My development, it's going to bring jobs and prosperity back to these good people.
All right, everyone, please, if you could just--
imagine what we could do if we had more wishes.
I'd wish to have a roller coaster in my backyard.

I'd wish to have my own drive-in movie theater in my backyard.
No, wait.
I'd wish to have my own spaceship in my backyard.
Yep, definitely a spaceship.
I'd wish for straight a pluses.
You already have straight a pluses.
Right.

I'd wish to be the president of Mensa.
I'd wish to have one more day with my grandpa.
Just one more.
That would be awesome.
This wish box is like having absolute power.
Maybe that's not such a good thing.
What do you mean?
How does that old saying go?
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
I'm thinking my grandpa hid this thing away for a reason.
I agree.
Maybe Ozzie was right after all.

Whoa, whoa!

We could have done anything with this wish box, but instead what did we use it for?
For candy and to get revenge on a bully.
Both very valid and necessary things.
Let's be reasonable.

You should use yours before we give it back.

Fine.

-Boring.

Like you said before, use it to help save the science museum.
Oh, no!

Well, that guy was quite the charmer, wasn't he?
Well, the municipality is leaning his way, that's for sure.
I've still got time.

I know that's a long shot, but I've got to try.
You're amazing.

I don't really have a choice.
Jane?

Michael Langley, do you remember me?
-Michael?

Michael, what a surprise.

Great, I'm really good.

She was amazing.

-Yeah.

Thank you.

I'm just visiting, yeah.
Yeah, I have.

-That's just, that's incredible.

I should come by for like a private tour or something.
Oh, well, I'm happy to hear that.

I'm so sorry.

-Hey, how are you.

Wow, that's a cool jacket.

A fella could hide a lot in there, huh?
I'm sorry.

Really good to see you.

-Bye.

-I'll see you.

-Okay, dear.

Okay, bye-bye.
What the heck are you doing?
I'm sorry I wasn't here, mom.
-Are you mad?

That's what you get when you send a boy to do a man's job.
No, no, that is not necessary.

Have it handled?

-No.

It would have been really nice for you to be here.
Okay, I'll see you at home, okay?

I feel so bad for letting my mom down like that.
Well, we can use the last wish to save the science museum.
We can't just wish for a million bucks.
We'll figure something out.
Hey, somebody's been here!
We've been compromised.
- By who?
See you later, dorkuses!
Who else?

Well, after what happened in the park today, he's got to be suspicious of something.
We should follow him and find out what he knows.
What?

You want to follow him?
And how is that a good idea?
Why did you call me here?
You can't keep ordering me around like this.
I can do anything I want.

Besides, I want you to meet someone.
-Who?

Apparently, I did need a boy to do a man's job.
Looks like a back alley business meeting if I ever saw one.
Though I never have, except in movies.
What's Martin doing here?
That's the guy I saw talking to my mom.
Who is that guy?
I don't know, but I don't like the looks of him.
-What are you gonna do?

Beat it.
If you do anything to hurt her, I swear I will-- if you don't want anything to happen to her, then you better stay out of my way.
Get outta my way.

I'm tryin' to get to my car.

Can you stop it, please?
First Seth, finds the clubhouse.

One thing's for sure, we can't let anybody get their hands on the wish box.
I've got an idea.
Ozzie, you down here?
Yeah, in the back.
Hi.
Ozzie, we need your help.
Sure, I'm at your service.
We need something from you.
Does this have anything to do at all with what we talked about the other day?
Yes.
I'm sorry.

But you have to trust us, Ozzie.
We promise we'll make it right.
- Cross your heart?

Double, double, double pinky swear.
I'm in.

Thanks, Ozzie.
And I'd also like to make a purchase.
Everything okay, guys?
- Yep.

I've got to go back to the science museum to finish some stuff up for the fundraiser tomorrow.
-We'll be fine.

-Yeah.

-Yeah.

All right.

-Okay.

-Bye, sweetie.

How was work today?
Work was fine.

You didn't happen to be downtown, did you?
As a matter of fact, I was.
Yeah, I had a meeting with a guy who's thinking about selling his house.
Why?
No reason.
Smart kid.
-Hey, what's going on?

Okay.

I need to tell you that--
Martin, it's okay.

I just-

Oh, good.
Good.

Are you okay?

Yeah, no, I'm-- I'm fine.

Okay, good.

-Okay.

-All right.

See ya.
--Say "science."
Science.

-I'm sorry.

Well, I came because of the tour that you promised me.
Oh no, Michael, look, we're actually just about to close.
That is so awesome!

That's great.
He fell for it.

Copy, on my way.
Copy, see you there.
I'm sorry, Mike, but I really think it'd be better if you came back tomorrow.
Oh, I can't come back tomorrow.

Hold on a second.

Oh, goodness.
All right.
That's-- you're kidding me.

That is awesome.

That is just-- it's like Christmas for me.
Oh, I'm so happy, Michael.

Martin's in on it.

Oh, Ricky, I'm so sorry.
We've got to use the last wish to save the science museum before it's too late.
It's already too late.
It's my duty to serve and protect this institution and I have-- don't beat yourself up.

Now look-- yeah, I'm gonna borrow that, all right?
Thanks.
Is it true that you have a gyrosphere here?
Let's go see it.
Don't go away.
I guess this proves you losers aren't much of an Adventure Club after all.
Seth, don't do this.
You're not one of the bad guys.
I'm sorry we never included you in our club.
I never wanted to be a part of your stupid club.
And we didn't include you, so for that, I'm sorry.
I don't care.
Take care of their bikes.
Forget it.

No, wait.

Well, I can't tie you to the train tracks.

And the hero enters riding on his hipster jeans.
Okay, Langley, you win.

You two know each other?
Oh, yeah, we go way back.

-Martin, what is going on?

'Cause I'm too busy destroying the fake wish box.
Really?

And here I thought you had such potential as a criminal.
Criminal?
I'm sorry.

What, so was everything just a lie?
No, no, not everything.

What do you mean?

What do you think my first wish is?
-What?

Criminal genius.

But you don't even have the real wish box.
Oh, God, I just love this kid's timing.

What do we got?
You know what?

Yeah!

I was just wondering if you were gonna follow through on your end of the deal.
What exactly is my end of the deal?
You promised me one of your wishes if I helped you.
-No, I didn't.

No, I didn't.

Just chalk it up to a valuable lesson in a life of crime.

You guys wait here.

Yeah.

-Good luck.

Now, we're talking.

Why isn't it working?

Because you forgot one very important detail.
Ricky.

You brought Ricky into this?
The box only grants wishes to the pure of heart.
Come on, man, the pure of heart?

Mom, are you okay?
Yes, sweetheart, I'm fine.
I still have one last wish granted to me.
And I'm willing to make a deal.
I'll agree to wish for you to have unlimited wishes, giving you complete control over the box.
Be careful, Ricky.
Hold on a minute.

I only have one condition.
You free my mom and let us go forever.
That's two conditions.
Think about it, Langley.

All right, you have a deal.
But I wanna see you write it down with my own eyes.
No, I want to dictate it.

"I hereby wish for Michael carruthers--"
don't say it-- "Langley...
To have unlimited wishes for all time in perpetuity."
-That's p-e-r-p--

-Satisfied?

All right, come on.

Give me the keys to the cuffs first.
No, make the wish first.
You think I'm stupid?
No, I don't.

Hey, that-- hey!

Ricky!
How did you do this?
Disappearing ink.
Good ol' Ozzie came through again.
That wish box is mine!
That wish box doesn't belong to anyone.
No human should possess this kind of power.
Which is exactly why I should have it.
God, you are your grandfather's grandson.
I am my grandfather's grandson.
And I'm proud of that.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

You good?

We're not done.

I'm so sorry, mom.
When I finally realized I could use it to help you save the science museum, it was too late.
I feel like I let you down.
Oh, Ricky, no, you didn't.
There is nothing more important to me in this world than you.
Naturally, I had everything under control.
That's him right there, officers.
Oh, thank God you guys are here.
Yeah.
I know I'm the last guy you probably want to talk to right now, but I just wonder if you'd give me a chance to explain myself.
Mom.
I'll keep this in a safe place, Miss Young.
Thanks, Curtis.
The truth is, is that I'm an archaeologist, like your grandfather, Ricky.
The only difference is that I got involved with some guys that I thought were legit, but they turned out to be gangsters who sold stuff on the black market, namely Langley.
-He was looking for this precious artifact.

Yeah.
He told me that all I had to do was get close to this woman...
And her son and find out anything I could, and if I did that, then he'd let me go free forever.
It seemed so easy.
That is until I met that woman...
And her son.
Hey, you blew it, kid.

You haven't heard the last of me, Ricky Martin.
I'll see ya in the big house, where you belong.

Live your life, you rambling rose.
Martin, don't listen to him.
Langley blackmailed you.
He's the one that should go to jail, not you.
Besides, we're a family now.
You really think so?
But I'm not the one you have to convince.
Hey, that was awesome what you did back there.
Yeah, well done, bro.
It was all of us, team effort.
Score one for the Adventure Club.
Is there anything else I need to know?
No.

I just wanted to say, good job.

You guys were right.

Thanks, Seth.
You know what?

Well, unfortunately, you guys, I think that I'm gonna have to concede defeat.
There is no way that I'm gonna be able to raise enough money by the end of the month to save the science museum.
You know, sometimes you can't make all your wishes come true.
Don't say that.
"True wishes are granted from within."
Maybe we can.
What do you mean?
I think I understand what grandpa meant by this note.
At first, I thought he meant from within the wish box, but he didn't, because those aren't true wishes.
True wishes are granted from within yourself.
It's up to you to make your wishes come true.
Don't you see?

All right, folks, single file, single file.
Let's keep everything moving in an orderly fashion.
Isn't this amazing?

Sorry.
I gotta say, this is pretty amazing.
All this thanks to our first adventure.
It took a while, but it was a doozy.
I'll say.

You guys are the kids who recovered the wish box, right?
That's right.
That was pretty amazing.
Thanks.

I work for an agency called the international artifact society.
recovering lost, precious relics and ensuring they do not fall into the wrong hands.
In fact, we did a lot of work with your grandfather.
-Really?

It's really nice seeing you follow in your grandfather's footsteps.
All of you, keep up the good work.
-We'll be in touch.

Look at this.
That was so cool.
Super cool!
Long live the Adventure Club.
Bam!
Zing.
Adventure Club!
Hmm.
- That's it.
