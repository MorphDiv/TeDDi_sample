I arrange luxury vacations for the 1% to see Asia.
We can guarantee that you'll be heavily featured on our home page.
I've failed at everything, May!
I really like her.
Find out if she actually likes you.
Whoa, Dylan!
Dylan, he's gone.
"I just need to be by myself to find myself."
It's a Search and Rescue!
Oof!
You nearly gave me a heart attack.
What, you were in love with the same girl?
I don't really want to go into it, if I'm honest.
Cool, cool, cos actually, I got...
Basically, we slept together in Vietnam and then I broke it off.
And then he said he really liked her, so I said I'd help him and ended up not doing that at all, trying to sleep with her again.
I just didn't know what I was doing.
I mean...
I hate myself.
So what was the endgame here?
You were going to commit suicide by throwing yourself in front of a car?
I was going to climb Everest and try and get some perspective.
That costs about $80,000 and two months of training.
I still don't know what I'm doing.
Did you say you were in Vietnam?
Yeah, Vietnam, China, Malaysia, Thailand.
Dildo, this is your lucky day.
What happened?
Eurgh!
Do not get me started.
Right, eyes peeled, people.
This is like a big old game of hide and seek.
Nepal!
It will be gravy, brother.
Find Dilbot, fix things up with Ash.
Everything back to normal.
I just don't feel I can handle normal any more, though, Greg.
I like her too much.
You should talk to him.
You can't declare your feelings for someone on a bus.
There's only one chicken.
I'm going to wait till we're somewhere more sexy.
Or, devil's advocate, try and kiss her.
Look, she's not interested in me.
OK.
Come on!
It just makes me angry hearing about it.
Yeah, and then my boss blames me for handing out too many business cards
Your boss sounds like an arsehole if he fired you for that.
Well, we got in an argument which escalated quickly.
There was some garden variety shoving and I accidentally nudged his cat out the window.
I'm just getting over it now.
Come on, baby!
(Come on.)
I never gave you a card, did I?
Definitely not.
No.
Answering phone again.
"Dylan J Nutkin is no longer friends with Dylan J Nutkin."
Clever.
I e-mailed her saying I was going to Nepal, and she replies with links to about 30 articles on how to survive an earthquake.
Isn't that exactly what you would do?
They got my appeal and they're inviting me in for a hearing
And I'll be by your side the whole way.
Now all we've got to do is scoop up old Dildo and then we can spend a couple of weeks trekking the shit out of them there hills.
Hey!
No.
Check that one.
He'll be OK, he'll be OK.
If it's perspective you need, this is much easier than climbing Everest.
And you're far less likely to get frostbite on your dick.
Dylan Nutkin.
He's like a tall, white, sort of spindly...
Ooh, can I have a look at one of those while I'm here?
I'll hide under a table if there's a tremor.
Yes, I'm in Kathmandu.
Stop repeating me.
No, I'm in Kathmandu, Mom.
Oh, my God.
Oh, there she is.
OK.
May!
My baby!
I didn't know you had a sister, May.
Just as in, you look way too young to be a mum.
Well, I just thought I'd drop by and say hi, make sure everything was OK.
You look like you haven't had a proper meal in a couple of weeks.
It's a place where people come to find some inner calm, defeat the ego, release desire, that kind of thing.
Why do I feel like you're taking a selfie behind my neck?
Listen, I've been sitting with monks for the last 15 years all over this city in order to work through some very serious shit.
No social media.
We're going to get through this together and I'm going to help you face up to the many, many, many, many, many mistakes you've made.
Oh, my God, Vanessa.
Well, I guess it's a step up from the Happy Bird Hostel in Penang.
We don't need you and your money, OK?
So, Sean.
It's another world, isn't it, Vanessa?
Facebook, Pokemon...
I'm much happier with a postcard.
I'll be genuinely honest with you.
Well, if he's got the Find My Phone app and you know his password, you can login and find his phone.
Have you done that to me?
Because you told me, didn't you?
Well, there is a website that tells you the location that all the social media posts are sent from.
Well, he posted this this morning.
Well, it's possible some malware might be
Why don't you join a few Isis chatrooms while you're at it, Mom?
OK, I've got the coordinates.
I'll just cut and paste them into Google Maps.
It's the Mahakanti Monastery and Retreat.
That's about five miles from here.
Houston, we have a Dylan!
I will order us a taxi.
What do you mean, "us", Mom?
Yeah, you made that clear too, Greg.
Just go easy on her, May.
You're all she's got, you know.
She's flown out here because she loves you.
Although Barbara is pushing 70, to be fair to her.
OK, OK, I get it.
What?
My God!
It's a cult.
We leave him for 24 hours and he joins a bloody cult.
Namaste.
What's that douche so happy about?
Dyl.
I'm really sorry I hit you, Dyl.
Let's just get out of this hippy-dippy Sunday school.
We're in the middle of a prayer session.
So you need to be good friends and give him the time you can.
I'm so sorry.
I know, I know, I know.
It's Dean Martin.
I'll make up for whatever I've missed.
It doesn't work like that, but as long as you get them out of you,
Whoa, whoa, and does know how you stole her identity in Vietnam?
I honestly think that Buddhism is the answer, Sean.
Oh, grow up, Dyl.
It's just another costume for you to take another selfie in.
I didn't flip-flop and I'm not a flip-flopper.
You're wearing flip-flops.
Don't shit on this because you don't understand it, OK?
Let me get some inner bloody peace.
This is not exactly how hide and seek should be ending.
What is it?
You can still do your appeal, right?
Yeah, yeah, it's just...
It's in three days.
Oh, for... .. sake!
This stone is so clean, you can have your lentil curry off it.
Sorry, you want me to scrub the whole square?
Thank you.
You missed a spot.
Urgh!
Right, so it looks like it's just the two of us, then, Seano.
The Great Wall-ees finally becomes the Trek-le Brothers.
Yeah, I'm going home too, Greg.
That's an upgrade, if anything!
Nah, I'm over it, I've got to get back to plumbing.
Playing second fiddle to gas, now.
That's a new low.
Kathmandu to Chicago.
At least I'll get to wish you a happy birthday.
Bonus.
So, erm... we haven't really had a chance to talk about what you said in Penang.
I really like you.
I think you're the kindest, most genuine, and... overall best person I've ever met.
I've been waiting for the right moment to tell you.
Weirdly, by the coffee at a crummy hostel is as good as it's got.
You're going in a day, you know.
I know.
A little more than a day.
Or I won't go home.
I'll stay with you, if that's what you want.
It's just...
You've got your appeal, haven't you?
You got your...
You don't want to throw away your whole future.
So, what do we do, then?
You know...
We leave it the way it is.
For now.
We've been mates for seven weeks now.
I'm sure we can manage one more day.
And three hours.
We'll be mates.
Oh, yes!
Sight for sore eyes.
Morning, May.
I'm sorry about yesterday, and for just surprising you like that.
I didn't mean to upset you.
Of course, she would.
She was just saying how much she wanted to do that, anyway.
Yeah, sure.
Oh, my God, there are monkeys everywhere.
Yeah, well, why do you think it's called the monkey Temple?
Well, I thought there would be monkey carvings, not real-life wild monkeys running around all over the place.
You can catch rabies or aids.
Only if you have sex with them.
I wish you weren't leaving tomorrow.
Don't try and talk me out of it, Mum, I said I'd be there for Ash.
I won't, it's just that, you know,
I took to weeks off from work for the first time this millennium, and I was just hoping I could get a little more out of it.
OK, so, I don't know.
Maybe call Auntie Pat, see if she'll come out and meet you?
Well, one of your friends?
You work in recruitment, Mum, surely you can recruit someone, or invite a colleague even?
They're busy, they're covering for me.
Or what about that French guy?
I'm not talking to Pierre right now.
Besides, I'm here to see you.
Look, I'm sorry if you find me irritating or intrusive.
It's just that... you keep shutting me out.
I feel like I'm losing you.
I have some anti-monkey hand sanitizer, by the way.
OK, great, I was holding the railings the whole way up.
Do I get to ride an animal, on this ten-day trek?
Maybe a donkey?
~
You know, could be cheaper if we join forces.
That's exactly what you said to us!
Well, which reminds me, I'll need a name for my new lot.
Well, how do you know they're not actual psychopaths or thieves?
It's all about taking a chance on people, on places, and seeing what happens, you know?
I would never be able to do something like that.
Probably just lock myself up in my room.
I can imagine you wandering around the markets, haggling for shawls.
So, I need ask you something.
No, it's fine, your role can be filled by my old buddy,
That'll come in another couple of days, when I slam my ice pick into this summit of some mountain, somewhere.
But no, what I wanted to say is, as I make my free transfer from the Wall-ees to my new club, the Hiker-paths,
I want to say to you all -- a big thank you for having me.
And here's hoping we meet up again, but, well...
20 years ago, I had a similar band of brothers.
That's all it is.
Well, cheers to that.
And I'm a goon, and I'm...
It's appalling.
Nepal-ing, it's absolutely Nepal-ing.
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
Here is good.
And you're going to get inside that hole, and you're going to meditate for a very, very long time.
Without food, without clothing.
Is that necessary?
You think you should be perhaps in a hammock somewhere?
Oh!
Sorry, it's not really great for digging, this.
Are you angry with me about something?
Angry?
Why would I be angry, what have you ever done to me?
OK, can't wait to get in this hole.
It's just they're difficult to nail, toasts, by their very nature.
I'm going to have to up my game for the Swedes.
Not a great send-off.
You know, maybe Greg was right.
Maybe it'll all feel different when we get home, maybe...
You've changed your tune.
Ash, I've wasted so much time worrying, stopping myself from doing that, scared of what might happen.
And all that ever does is nothing, happen, nothing happens.
And I don't want that.
I want to be with you, Ash, even if it's just for a few hours.
I...
I'm coming with you.
Here.
It's romantic.
~
No!
~
Are we ready for the hiker-paths?
Lavelle Kitchen Solutions, Greg Lavelle, CEO speaking.
Sean.
Sorry, it came up as an unknown number, so it was a work thing.
Happy birthday!
Where did you get to last night?
No, not yet.
We're only allowed one call.
Well, I mean I'm touched that you've called me.
Um...
Yeah, I can do that, but I'm...
About to go hiking.
All right.
Hey, Anders.
Something's come up that I have to deal with, I can't come right now.
But what I can do is come, um... .. like tomorrow or come late this afternoon.
Yes, you.
Ma-ha-kan-ti monastery, please.
This isn't going to work, is it?
We should've just stayed mates.
Or you should've made a move on me sooner, it wouldn't have been in such a rush.
How long until your flight?
Four and a half hours.
They're probably just looking for the right form.
I think it might take them a while to find that one.
Dylan.
Dildo!
OK, thank you.
Dylan!
Dylan!
Dylan.
Greg.
Dylan.
Um...
Sean and Ash have been arrested.
Oh, my goodness, that's not going to go down well.
No, it hasn't gone down well!
Thank you!
The embassies are doing f-all to help.
The monks are furious.
Come on, we need to help them.
I was going to say, what are you doing in a hole?
Come on, Dyl.
You're Dylan Nutkin.
You're just a normal... .. slightly wanky guy from Kingston.
Best friends with Sean.
Listen brother, you're not toxic.
You're just 20.
I can't leave now, Greg.
I don't feel any different, it hasn't worked yet.
It has, actually.
Seeing you suffering like that, in a hole, has really diminished my anger.
You knew about that?
I figured it out.
So you mean, this whole thing isn't real Buddhism.
You know, I don't know, actually, it is.
You... are a bloody rotter.
You don't know what you're talking about, because of him, I was fired.
Yeah, I lost my job, I lost the expense account, a cat was injured,
How did I get myself fired?
You threw your cat out of the window and punched your own boss.
You cut your boss?
With keys, I cut him with keys, this is what I'm saying, it's a longer story than you know about.
And you refused to take responsibility.
I've given you ample opportunity to admit what you did,
You were never going to make a breakthrough anyway, it's not in you.
Well, I have, actually.
And I may not be the best Buddhist.
No, you're a bad Buddhist.
But I'm pretty sure it's not about being angry or cruel, and you don't reach enlightenment by turning your back on the world,
Well, I'm out, then.
I'm going back to my friends.
Do you think we should stop and get Sean a birthday cake?
Not on his list of priorities right now, thank you, Dildo.
Let's just get there.
Right?
You go in and see what you can do.
I'll go and get May and her mum.
Dyl, don't do anything stupid.
Or I thought we could go camel trekking through the desert.
Yeah, well, I will need Wi-Fi to Skype Ash, though, mum.
If I don't project manager appeal, she might storm in there stinking of liquor and tell them to eat shit and
It's OK.
Admin, I'm just here on admin.
I'm sorry, I didn't see them.
Go, go, go, go.
Did anyone call the embassy?
They were worse than useless, Vanessa.
I mean, what if they're going to execute us?
They could have the death penalty here.
Then I guess, we should've kept going.
Oh, my God, Sean.
We'll be fine, don't worry.
What's that?
Yes, I love you, Britain, I told you.
You're British Ambassador?
That's right, fast-tracked.
Apologies I couldn't come sooner.
Been on the phone with Boris all morning.
Anyways, I'm happy to report that's it all been dealt with.
You're free to go.
That's great news.
It was a good effort, Dyl.
Yeah.
Happy birthday, anyway.
Cheers.
So, what happened to you being a Buddhist, then?
Yeah...
Decided to be myself for a bit.
You know, not try any costumes on.
Apart from this one, obviously.
It's good to have you back, man.
Nowhere else I'd rather be.
Oh, get a room, you two!
Dylan, you absolute jizz hand!
Why are you behind bars, you doughnut?
Well, that's clearly obvious.
OK, so we talked to the station chief guy and it looks like the monks want to press charges.
Apparently it could take them weeks.
But what are the charges, though?
So I'm missing my appeal, then?
That's that, right?
I'm really sorry, Ash.
Of course not, Sean.
Don't be a dick, Dylan.
What if it wasn't consensual?
You need to let her go, all right?
OK, OK, you're free to go now.
Your friend has talked to the monk.
Your charge has been dropped.
What friend?
I think I might have called you a rotter earlier.
And as a disciple of mine once said,
"Holding anger while practising Buddhism
"does not make much spiritual sense."
Well, your disciple was right.
10...
Can I transfer the money online?
Yes, all right, OK.
Oh, yeah, fiscally they're very, very modern.
OK, well, that's my karma quotient.
Thumbs up, buttercup.
Oh, please!
Namaste.
Thanks, Mom.
It's just nice to be needed.
So you can go home with Ashley.
It's clearly what you want.
So, we can just go now?
You have to.
You're being deported, right away.
Bye, May.
I'm so glad we weren't able to get rid of you.
Thank you so much, May, you're going to make me cry!
We're not going to lose touch, not be like the Thai bandits.
Please, just one second.
Just, like, one sec.
Oh!
OK, come and stay as soon as you're legally allowed, OK?
Yeah, great idea --
Americans love people entering their country illegally.
Hey, Sean, Sean!
We're going to do your 22nd birthday on Machu Picchu OK?
Hey, don't drag her, that's not cool!
Bye, Greg!
Oh, thank you.
This deportation thing is actually pretty ideal, cos we can do our last two weeks travelling just around the UK.
We can do Avebury stone circle, which is kind of like a Stonehenge but before it was famous.
Dyl, we're not travelling any more.
We're going home now.
Right.
Oh, we can also do Wordsworth's house!
You're a psycho, you know that?
It's not a gap year.
Well, no, not yet.
India.
I hear Darjeeling's supposed to be pretty banging this time of year.
Oh, yeah, I know for a fact it is.
I've played it before once or twice!
I kind of like Days Of Thunder.
