Massinger.
You slit the throat of the only beast I own, didn't you?
How soon a man forgets his place in this world.
No.
Do you dare?
Come on.
What makes you so sure it were me what killed your beast, eh?
In't there other men hereabouts who wants to see you suffer?
Governor, I know it's not for me to dally with such matters but I've been preoccupied with what might have happened to the map.
The gold map.
I am aware which map you refer to, Mistress Castell.
I have a rather fanciful notion of what might have happened of it.
If you will excuse us, Mistress Castell.
Doesn't Governor Yeardley usually take the opportunity of church to pass greetings with the townsfolk?
I see it clearly, right here before me, like it was yesterday.
It was yesterday.
He seemed distracted to me.
The way his wife steered him away so urgently.
Yes, she did, like he were in pain.
Were he in pain, ma'am?
Mistress Castell!
What a shame your good heart so persuasively hides itself from your face.
But it is not good for my neighbours to see me weak or ill-disposed.
Yes, of course.
That is a reason to hurrying home from church for.
Mistress Sharrow!
I wish to say how sorry I am.
If you'll be willing to hear my regrets for all the harm that I've caused you and Silas.
Sorry?
For what I've done.
James, it was you who killed our beast?
Could you believe such a thing of me?
But di-didn't you just tell me that...?
I meant fighting with Silas.
For hounding you when you didn't want me to.
You decided it was me, didn't you?
Before now.
In your mind it was me who did it.
It's cruelty marking a man as a devil when his only crime is a broken heart.
I'll show you.
I will find a way and you will see.
I didn't notice anything wrong with him.
Because he is attempting to keep his sickness hidden.
He appeared to me to be in great pain.
Samuel, if the governor succumbs to some sort of affliction, then what will become of the colony?
Someone must step forward.
There are days when I can't keep up with your thinking.
Who in defence of his King will fight for to maintain his country's right
Inviting all his fellow peers to lift themselves for volunteers
That was the ballad.
I heard it on the street.
It mesmerised me with glory.
Throw his life away for the sake of a ballad?
A man who wants for bread.
Ah!
And tell me.
Was it sung by a pretty lass?
One you might wish to impress with your courage to take up arms?
You don't need to fight to get a girl, Bailey.
Your sweet face will do that for you.
To come into the wilds, as you did, on your own, that's a risk no man should take.
Not when he has a brother could come with him.
Nine year ago Yeardley left the uplands beyond the falls without any gold.
Now he's come back.
Why?
Because he knows where to look.
He has a map.
That is why I must go now.
Silas had been with you, he might've saved you.
Tomorrow we start to climb.
You ready for that?
Why fear evil spirits when men's the ones will see you burn alive?
I've been a servant too long.
Gold.
Yeah, gold will make me a man they all must reckon with.
Master Massinger has held a grievance against me from the day I was given my own land.
Silas Sharrow with his own cattle was a sign of progress, so he killed the beast.
It's a serious charge to make against a man of high reputation, Sharrow.
Yes.
I came here to ask for justice.
Will you question Master Massinger on this matter?
Did you see Master Massinger kill the beast?
It was done by dark, sir, and when we woke...
My husband fears that if word gets to the Company that he is sick, they will recall him.
Has there been sickness?
Pain when you pass water?
He has been passing blood every day.
The pain stops me from thinking clearly.
I can't work.
- I can barely speak.
- If you please.
I'm sure you all share my grave concerns for our governor's welfare.
Rest assured that while he is laid low
I will offer my services to take charge of the colony.
We cannot be without authority.
Not for one day.
You have a stone.
In your kidney.
I will have to remove it.
You mean to cut me?
What will happen if you do not remove this stone?
They sometimes pass.
But I have known men taken by such fever and such pain that they perish.
I did not come here to take my last breath.
I will give you my decision tomorrow, Dr Priestly.
I've been looking at how this place goes on and on.
Wonders as far my eyes can see.
It's always restored me to see it.
And to know what it means to build a new world.
Hmm.
Me and you, Alice... we'll have children.
And they'll have children... and the world will change.
Hmm.
Where are you headed, James?
Somebody will have to find out what happened to your brother.
Militia man don't sound so grand as being a soldier but it's the same thing.
We don't have a uniform no more, we work as farm hands but when we're called upon we are the army.
Fletcher, you're like a slubbering cock dog.
We shall have to tame you, boy.
Now Bailey...
Now there's a boy who need only flash his honeyed smile.
- Your powder horn should be ready.
Pour it down the barrel.
Be gone with you.
I will tell the marshal it was a misfortune.
I witnessed it all, Marshal.
It was no more than young men's jostling.
Fletcher came after Bailey and the pistol fired.
He never intended to harm him.
Thank you, Mistress Rutter.
My friend,
I'm sure you will understand why I put myself forward to take charge of affairs in a way that may have perhaps seemed hasty.
I did it to give us, both of us, best advantage.
The Company have already refused your petition once.
We must not make the same mistake.
What they wish for now is civil governance.
Yeardley is stricken before our eyes.
Together.
Bailey, you know well enough what becomes of a man who kills another.
Suppose there was a way that you might be spared the noose.
How'd you care for that?
James Read in't looking up that river, Alice.
He sees my failure.
You're at your most handsome when you're troubled.
Hey.
We are here now.
James Read can chase us all that he wants.
I only know this.
Us.
I only know love.
The Indians said there was women.
A ship full of them came to Jamestown.
Did you not get yourself a wife from amongst them, Henry?
Must you talk all day long?
If I was a man in Jamestown, all them years, I'd want a maid.
What man wouldn't?
I've asked you kindly to stop talking.
Now stop.
I have a wife.
I ain't married her yet but she's mine.
What's her name?
She is.
So your good brother will be caring for her till you return.
Davie...
No man has seen the worst of what's in here.
It in't death you should fear, my friend.
So, let's speak about the Indians, speak about the gold... the demons in the caves.
But no more words about my brother.
Or Alice.
Mistress Rutter, she kept telling us,
And she was saying sweet things to me, Marshal.
Hold your tongue!
Fletch kept trying to pull Mistress Rutter to him.
And she would run her hand across his face.
Put her finger to his lips.
Then she'd dart away, sir.
I forgot to mention, Marshal.
When it was getting late,
Mistress Rutter whispered that I should meet her, outside, sir.
When we left the tavern I saw Fletcher was standing on his heels, sir.
So I told him I was gonna meet the tavern keeper's wife.
He flew into a rage, sir.
We were both so drunk.
Fletcher said that she...
Mistress Rutter had a fix to meet with him, same as me.
In't I been a comfort to you?
Go on, Bailey.
She set one against the other, as far as I could see.
Bailey, you were duped with drink into a black folly at the hands of the tavern keeper's wife.
You're free to go.
You ain't fit to tug on the skirt of a woman with my wife's virtue.
Come away, lover.
Bailey...
I understand you blaming me if it saved your life.
But you can tell the truth now, can't you?
- You can tell me you're sorry.
I never knew you had it in you.
Why didn't the marshal not bring a charge against you, huh?
The door was open, I had to see whether our dear governor was stricken.
It is as I feared.
Your sympathy is appreciated, Mistress Castell.
May I?
Sir, if your sickness does not improve, forgive me for saying it, I dearly pray it is not so...
I implore you to consider what it will mean.
Think of whose hands this place will fall into.
Sir, should you not nominate a man you trust to carry your voice, your purpose, a man of integrity, such as Samuel...
My husband is suffering.
Can you see nothing in it but your own benefit?
What I see, Lady Yeardley, is that a simpering rag to the governor's brow might swell your woman's heart, but it'll make a gift of the colony to your husband's enemies.
You are from Banbury, aren't you, Mistress Castell?
In Oxfordshire.
- Not far from Banbury.
I am certain that Elizabeth will know who you are.
Indeed, I have written to ask her.
Who is it looks out for you men?
Do my bidding and we'll all benefit.
I spent it in good company...
I knew that being the only doctor here I would have to perform surgery.
But it still...
I have never yet saved a life.
Each time I fail I blame myself.
Why would you destroy the tavern that gives you drink and song?
Hey!
Why are you doing this to us?
We are here because you are the cause of Fletcher's death.
I've decided to let the doctor remove the stone.
Give the box to Samuel.
I will return this to you when you are recovered.
That boy was told to blame me.
What purpose is there for them to come here like a wild mob?
Well, the governor is sick and the marshal's plotting something.
If I am to offer legitimate authority here, Thomas, it does not aid my cause to have young hedge cocks running amok.
These men, Secretary, were once soldiers.
But you will speak to them, Thomas?
Tell them that, at this time especially, what we require is a calm and peaceable settlement.
See here is our difficulty, Secretary.
These are the men who enforce order.
Politics will only ever hold control when men at arms give it permission to.
I've picked out some belladonna so that you might furnish me with it on your return.
Tell me what it is that troubles you.
Er, there is a burning in my fingertips.
I will give you no belladonna today.
Nor any other day.
Please... tell me what it is you're afraid of.
I have a pain in my fingers.
Since I was a child it's afflicted me.
I've been watching you, Jocelyn, since you came here.
You are the most glittering, daring woman
I have set my eyes upon.
But something haunts you.
You will hate me if I tell you.
How could I ever hate you?
I was not always the woman you see now.
I was a girl... giddy with the thought of romance.
I wish only to love and please a man.
A husband of my own and then there he was.
15 years older than me.
He wooed me with a tender, delicate, precious promise.
I was robbed of sleep with the thought of marriage.
And so one day I let him... walk me into the woods without a chaperone.
And every day after that I wished only to find the time to be alone with him.
And my own sister told me,
I cannot bear to speak his name, that he was to be married.
But not to me.
I was merely a wager that he had taken on.
That he could seduce me.
We were not alone in the woods.
His friends were watching us.
And a week after I found out I could not breathe.
And I knew only one thought, one need.
That he should not breathe.
So I poured poison into his wine.
And I waited.
My eyes on his.
Until he knew what I'd done to him.
And I watched him die.
Now do you hate me?
I do not hate you, Jocelyn.
I love you.
Tell your husband I'd be delighted to join you both for dinner.
Why are you helping me?
If you were taken by a slip of the foot... a misfortune... when I could stop it...
I'd feel defeated.
I don't like feeling defeated.
Is it not unwise to be alone with another man's wife, Doctor?
Her fingers trouble her.
She asked for a remedy.
Her fingers.
Yes, I can see how you might be desirous to give your attention to them.
Should the governor die under your knife, Dr Priestly, no one will blame you.
Indeed, whoever should take charge of the colony would know that you only wished to serve your masters.
I trust you will do your duty.
There in't a more beautiful woman in this whole colony.
There in't a more fair skin, comely eyes, shining hair.
- There in't a more true soul...
Jocelyn...
Mercy.
I do, ma'am.
I surely do.
I in't never known a sweeter mistress.
Hold him!
We're closed.
I feel sick that I stood there and gave the blame of it all to you.
I regret what I did to this place.
There in't no sense in kicking a tavern to hell.
Did the marshal put you up to it?
The marshal's the only man who knows what it means to be a soldier.
He's the only man who stood up for us.
I mean, without no soldiers, there in't no law, no order.
What are you gonna do, Bailey?
Nothing will be the same.
The governor will survive?
I am hopeful of it, sir.
Then that is a blessing.
An unexpected blessing.
I once witnessed a woman punished for the mortal sin of adultery.
It was quite a spectacle.
The offender stood in full view of the congregation during the Sunday service.
She wore a white sheet to represent the shroud.
Was bare-headed, bare-footed.
She confessed her fault and expressed her true regret.
But her penance was deemed insufficient and she was deprived of the association of any members of the town.
Sir, I resent the suggestion that...
I do believe that you love Mistress Castell.
I refuse to listen to such cruel slander.
You, of course, will remain unblemished and untouched by reprimand and correction.
Make your accusation, sir, with any proof you can muster.
Or leave me in peace.
The woman I spoke of, she was my mother.
I was the witness to the crime.
I was 12 years old.
Hm.
What do you want from me?
For now it is enough that you have lost the peace that you had.
The varlet has taken it from you.
I saw my brother.
Well, I spoke to the Appomattuck and they found him.
Took him in till he recovered.
Then why's he not come back to us?
The Indians told me that Henry's gone to the uplands, past the falls.
Why does it take the blacksmith to discover your brother's still living?
I saw a dead man.
And his woman.
Was this truly an accident, Silas Sharrow, eh?
If Henry was here, he would tell you as much himself.
Then, if you are to clear your name, shouldn't you seek to find him?
If it was my brother, that's what I'd do.
Henry Sharrow is alone.
Don't you care to find out what has happened to him?
When have any of you men ever been concerned for the Sharrows?
Why should you suddenly tell my husband what he must do?
What can they claim against you?
They want you to go off into the wilds and search the whole of Virginia?
You have a plantation to care for now.
You have a wife to care for now and people will know it makes no sense.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Just leave me be!
Leave me be.
I fear for what he'll do to Silas when he learns that we're wed.
Ma'am, what is it?
Temperance Yeardley knows.
What does she know?
That I poisoned a man.
She's written to her cousin in Oxfordshire.
She told me as much.
So she can seek out information about my life there.
When that ship comes in I must get that letter.
Something to gain the pity of Temperance Yeardley.
Who told you this?
Sir, he's little more than a boy.
Thank you, Verity.
Sir, I...
I fear it is you they intend to turn against.
You ain't no rebel, Bailey.
It in't in you.
So why are you so intent on this?
My name will be remembered.
Marked on this town.
This world.
Nathan Bailey, something of a man... with a musket in his hand.
Don't be about after darkness falls.
You ain't nothing but a sweet, shy... boy.
I pass my hand across your head, hm?
Your face flushes.
Bailey, did you ever love a girl?
Cos a lover's true kiss is worth living for.
There's women coming here, Bailey.
Plenty of them.
Beautiful girls wanting kisses off handsome men like you.
It's too late.
How's it too late?
Because I heard a ballad once.
And it made a soldier of me.
I won't wait for them to come to me.
I'll go and meet them.
Sir, if you exert yourself too soon, you will open up the wound.
They're soldiers with weapons.
I know only too well what can become of this.
I will use what works best with such men.
- Soldiers respect nothing more than a military man.
Is there a better way for a man to die than at the hands of men at arms?
I saw battle against the Spanish in the Netherlands as a foot soldier.
It is a wound from that time that has stopped me from talking to you until now.
So we are the same, are we not?
I am one of you.
I wore the uniform to serve God and country.
And now I am the Governor of the Colony of Virginia, knighted and trusted by our King.
And I have this office because I showed it obedience and loyalty.
And you...
Good men.
Every one of you.
Jeffers.
Dyer.
Stubbs.
Bailey.
I was like you.
A boy soldier in a foreign land.
No way to see how I might prosper.
Until a good captain saw in me what I see in you.
Suppose I was to offer you a position of authority?
The Governor of Virginia's Personal Guard.
Fine uniform.
Would you like that?
I would, sir.
Come here.
Bailey... what has brought you to this?
That man is a traitor!
He's the ring leader here.
He tried to get close to you, Governor, so that he might kill you.
It is true.
Every one of you, it's over.
Now get back to work.
We will have order here.
What have they done to you?
Thank you, Marshal.
Hmm.
I'll be a good wife to you, Samuel.
You are a good wife to me.
No.
No, I'm selfish... and quarrelsome.
And overzealous for your position.
Will you forgive me?
There's nothing for me to forgive.
We made it, Davie.
Now is our time.
