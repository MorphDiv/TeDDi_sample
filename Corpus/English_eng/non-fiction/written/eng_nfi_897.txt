*STEVEN UNIVRSE* Season 04 Episode 17
"Rocknaldo" Synchronized by srjanapala
[ Sighs ] Space is great, but nothing beats some good ol' atmosphere.
Ronaldo:

Protect yourself against the menace that threatens Beach City!
Protect yourself against the menace that threatens Beach City?
Mr. Smiley, protect yourself against the menace that threatens Beach City?
I'll protect myself from the menace that threatens Beach City.
Steven!

Let's get knowledgeable!
"How to Protect Yourself Against Rock People"?
What?
"Alien entities walk among us"?
"They're adding mind-controlling minerals to our water suppl..."
"They hate men"?

Protect yourself against the menace that...
Ronaldo!

Well, technically, it's an infozine pamphlet, but I've been calling them Ronalphlets.
I get that part.
I'm talking about all this mean stuff you're saying about the Crystal Gems!
No, no, no.

Crystal Gems fight Rock People.
See my documentary...

Crystal Gems don't just fight Rock People.

Also, don't say "Rock People." It's offensive.
Rock People are different, obviously.
For starters, they have rocks embedded in their bodies.
Like this?
But they can summon weapons from the Mud Dimension.
[ Warble ]
No, no, you're not getting it.
They can alter their forms.
That's how they trick humans into loving them!
Wait a second.
You're a rock person?

I'm a Crystal Gem, Ronaldo.
[ Yowls ]
And you're not wrong about everything.
We're just ignored and misunderstood.
I'm so glad you're the only one that took a Ronalphlet!
I'm so sorry!
[ Crying ]
Hey, it's okay.
Everyone makes mistakes.
Just as long as you realize that the Crystal Gems and I aren't that different from you.
Right.

I gotta go...

"I'm shutting down my blog," blah blah blah,
"social media," blah.
"I may never come back to the Internet!"
[ Chuckles ] Whoa, dude.
I suppose it's a good thing that he's taking time to think.
There's a new post.
- Hmm.

Good day, loyal followers of Keep Beach City Weird.
I've come to you today because I pride myself in bringing you the truth about all the weird stuff in Beach City
The Man doesn't want you to know about.
But today, I need to tell you some truths about this man!
I've mixed up what is right and wrong and ended up saying some pretty mean things about the Crystal Gems.
I feel terrible about my mistake because I know more than anyone what it's like to do thankless work and to be an outsider!
That's why I'm joining the Crystal Gems!
[ Snorts, laughs ] What?

[ Pounding on door ]
Steven!
Ronaldo!
Guess what!
You want to join the Crystal Gems?
[ Gasps ] I thought you'd never ask!
You know, I always felt strangely at home here.
Unh-unh.

And you certainly can't join the Crystal Gems.
But...

Your body is organic.
My body's organic, and I'm a Crystal Gem.
You're going to entertain this?
We're all different, but we love and accept each other.
That's what Crystal Gems do.
And isn't it great that someone is actually interested in what we do?
What better way to show him what we're about than to accept him as a Crystal Gem, too?
Uhhh...
Let's do this!
Well, it's not the strangest houseguest we've had.
So, when do I get issued my gem?
Ohhhh.

But if you had a gem, what would you want it to be?
Well, I care so much,
I think it'd be, like, deep in my heart.
Or like a million tiny gems, like one crushed-up gem coursing through my blood, like...

Perfect!

Wait!

I have a gem weapon now, too!
Wow!

I got it at Delmarva Con last year.
It's a replica from the anime
"I Can't Believe My Stepdad's My Sword."
It can cut through a carton of milk like a carton of butter!
There's a half-full juice box by the TV.
Huhhhh...
Ahhhh!
Nice!

[ Warble ] Thanks.
Mission time!

Let me grab my katana from upstairs.
[ Grunting ]
[ Wheezing, panting ]
I'm gonna take the stairs.
Uh, I'm sorry, Bloodfry.
You're going to have to sit this one out.
It's a bit dangerous.
But Steven gets to go.
Steven is different.
He's been training with us for years.
Steven:

I didn't get to come along at first, either.
We can start your training soon.
Be back in a bit!
[ Warble ]
But...

Um... hi, Bloodstone.
Oh.

So... how'd the mission go without me holding you back?
Uh, it went fine.
You know, the usual... fighting monsters, sharing emotions.
I'm glad you didn't get hurt...

Yeah.
Well, I'm heading out.
And you're going out like that?
Uh...

Well, I just think a real Crystal Gem would want to show off their gem, like, all the time.
If I had a gem, I'd show mine off.
Female voice [ Calmly ]:

The trees are quiet.

A small rabbit begins to sing.
Ahhhh...
- Ronaldo:

[ Inhales deeply ]
[ Grunts ]
[ Sighs ] Bloodstone, I know you want to train, but it's bedtime.
Funny that you... sleep, when gems don't need sleep.
Why is that?
I...

Because I'm half human, I get tired and I...
Huh.

[ Yawns ] tired at all.
[ Clatter ]
Ever since I became a Crystal Gem, uh... sleeping...

I don't... do it.
That's great, Bloodstone.
What a cool name.
I'm so cool.
Bye, Connie!

Aah!
Her gem weapon's a sword, huh?
She totally ripped that off from me.
What?

How come I don't get your mom's gempon?
That's "gem" and "weapon."
Well, Connie's been a part of the Crystal Gems longer than you, so...
Admit it...

What are you talking about?

She doesn't even live here!
I'm here all the time!
Look at that quality groove I've established!
If she was a real Crystal Gem, she'd be a little bit more dedicated!
Are you serious?

Bloodstone, ever since you got here, all you've done is boss me around!
Who are you to tell anyone how to be a Crystal Gem?

You're just...

Is that love?
Is that acceptance?
Maybe you're the one that isn't a Crystal Gem.
I think you need to leave...

What is my problem?
He just wanted to be included.
If I were really a Crystal Gem, I'd never...
Wait a second.
Ronaldo: [ Laughs ]
Amethyst?

Yo, I didn't even say anything.
Bloodstone!

You're right!

But you've been acting really mean to me, and I don't love that.
I don't accept that.
I wish I hadn't snapped at you.
it's just...

But the second it wasn't about you, you stopped caring.
This isn't the Bloodstone club about making Bloodstone feel good.
This is my whole life!
Do you care about that or not?

Whoa!
You truthed him so hard, he died!
No!
Bloodstone!

[ Snoring ]
[ Sighs ] He's just asleep.
Guess staying awake for a whole week finally caught up with him.
Well, what do we do with Fryrocko now?
We should let his parent know he's back.
[ Warble ] [ Deep voice ] Hey, Dad.

Blog, blog, blog.
That was really good!
[ Warble ] [ Normal voice ] Thanks!
I'll... text Peedee and let him know he's here.
You think he'll be okay?
You've worried about him enough, Steven.
Crystal Gems, let's head back.
[ Snoring ]
[ Seagulls crying ]
Bloodstone!
Oh.

Are you all right?
I haven't seen you in three weeks.
Yeah.

And then I did some hard thinking.
I wasn't acting like Bloodstone.
I was acting like [Inhales deeply] Jerknaldo.
You accepted me, but I still felt like an outsider.
I guess even amongst outsiders, I am the ultimate outsider.
I think it's better Ronaldo Fryman work alone.
Are you sure?
I was really glad you wanted to help our cause.
I still do.
Oh.

When did that happen?
I used the magic of photo-editing software.
Hey, but, uh...

Yeah.
Why don't you use your Gem name?
Oh.

Actually, the only time Gems really call me that is if they're about to kidnap me or beat me up.
That's rough, buddy.
You want me to put that in the Ronalphlet?
Ehh... maybe not.
Got it.
