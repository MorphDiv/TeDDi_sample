Previously on Daytime Divas...
Oh, Maxine, look, it was your vagina.
It's my show.
You can't fire me.

- Leave Andrew.

Maxine Robinson's fallen into a coma.
She could be like this for a while.
Who's getting her left chair?
I'm getting a restraining order.
Is that how you treat your mother?
I just need to let go.

- Is Brad getting rough with you?

- I love you.

Remember that sexual harassment seminar?

What do you want?
Maxine claimed to never have had cosmetic surgery.
Blepharoplasty?

Your vitals have returned to normal.
My body wasn't even cold yet and they're trying to steal my show.
We should issue a press release that my condition remains still in a coma, fighting for my life.
In all my years reporting the news,
I have interviewed presidents, princes, and pop stars.
But there are other voices that I wanted to be heard.
So, a decade ago I created a show, where women could sit down and say what's on their minds.

We have a real slice of American pie, who puts faith and family first;
A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist with a passion for justice;
A child star who is all grown up.

and me, Maxine Robinson.

- Two minutes, standby.

Maxine Robinson rose from her humble beginnings in Jamaica,
Queens, to become an award-winning journalist.
We're making it sound as if she's dead.

- Was there an update?

Okay, good.

She's still in a coma.
Besides her success as a broadcaster, businesswoman and humanitarian, she's also a great philanthropist.
Really?
She still hasn't paid me for the wrapping paper from Savannah's school fundraiser.
Guys, they're trying to listen to this.

- Thank you.

Maxine was a trailblazing working mother, having rescued her nephew, Shawn, from an unstable home, and he became not only her legally adopted son but a treasured member of our family here at The Lunch Hour.
I bet you he has a treasured member.
Inappropriate.
Though her marriage to Ted Winsor, a successful entrepreneur and the love of her life, ended in a heartbreaking tragedy...
And she never had sex again.
I can't imagine losing a husband.
I would be so lost if anything ever happened to Brad.
Like Maxine often said, nobody can ever replace the love of your life.
We'd all be better off if she'd dust the cobwebs up out of...
From all of us here at NAB and our family at The Lunch Hour, we salute Maxine Robinson.
Back to live in three, two...
That was so inspiring.
If you can somehow hear me, Maxine, we want you back.
We all want her back, Kibby.
Keep on praying just as we've all... well, as I've been doing, which leads me to my own personal tribute.
When I was sitting with her in the hospital, something came to me, a song that celebrates the power that we have to heal.
It's called For God's Sake.
What a crock.

She's been trying to get me to let her sing that song for the past two months.

- Cut to commercial.

- Now!

- ♪ Good God... ♪

Okay, Mom, you've had your fun, but we can't keep doing this.
It's making me look bad and the network's starting to think we're all incompetent.
They assume you're making mistakes out of grief because I'm not there.

They may love it, but I've got Jason
Abel up my ass every five minutes.
Abel's a network president.
Up an ass is where he's most comfortable.
He wants to bring in replacement cohost for you.
After three days?
Never happen.
My empty chair is getting huge ratings.
Which reminds me to get Mo's fat ass out of it, now.
Short of a leash, I can't get
- her to stay in her own chair.

Abel says they're looking at Tyra Banks.
- Puh-lease.

- She'd be good.

- No!

We can't have a woman with male privilege.
- Ann Coulter.

Oh damn.
They're looking at Michelle Obama.
Hello?

- Where is Leon?

He's harder to find on the floor than you.
I've got a bit more on my plate than Leon.
Leon forgot to take my phone and Brad called in the middle of the show.
You don't know how to turn your own phone off?
And Brad hasn't realized what time The Lunch Hour's on yet?
Please don't attack my Brad.
He's the perfect husband and father.
The problem is Leon.
He dropped my cards and put them back in the wrong order.
Isn't it your job to check them?
Why are we making excuses for him?

No, okay?

Well, he screws everything up.

Oh!
Finally.

It's a figure of speech.
Mine would taste that good to if I took 45 minutes to make them.

- So bitter.

Mm!

Do I have anything in my teeth?
- Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry.

Going live.
Oh my goodness.
Sorry about all of that.

As you can see, we're still a little bit lost
- without our fearless leader.

Which is why I want to share my tribute.
You're going to do it again?
Here we go.
Thank you.
♪ For God's sake it's how I... ♪
For God's sake, what are you all moping around for?
Nobody died!
What the...
- You're back.

How?
Well, one minute I was out, the next, I was wide awake.
Well, come, sit down.
I would love to.
But, Mo, you look so at home in my chair.
Thank you, Maxine, I feel at home.
Well, it's good to be back.
Mo, I want to thank you for filling in for me.
You know how I appreciate initiative.
That's all the time we have today.
Tune in tomorrow; we'll have so much more to talk about, including an in-depth discussion with the ever-popular and sometimes controversial Dr. Justin Timmerman.
So, join us tomorrow and, always remember, lunch is on us.
That's a wrap.
- Maxine, I'm so glad you're okay.

Your hair looks really good from being in a coma.
I thought it'd be all flat in the back.
Thank you, I appreciate your concern and how hard you all worked in my absence.

- Indeed.

- That's all.

Uh, well, please let us know if you need anything.
- If I do, I'll let you know.

Uh, Kibby, um, can we have a chat in my office?
- Me?

Oh, sure.

- How are you, baby girl?

How are you?
Anything you wanna tell me?
You mean about me?
I'm not worried about you.

Thank you, that's, that's very nice.
To be honest, I, I had a bit of a rough time.
Of course, you did.

- It's so disappointing.

Well, don't apologize.

Huh?
Oh, no, they were fine.

- What is it, baby?

Kibby, you know, I'm very proud of you.
And I'm so impressed on how far you've come.
If you ever need to talk, you know you can always come to me.
I do know that.

- Is there anything else?

Just do me a favour and stay there for another five minutes.
And when you leave here, don't breathe a word of this to the other women.

***Like hookers on dollar day.
- Kibby, what did she say?

- Just asked me how I was.

- Oh, really?

Did she trash us?

She can't be right in the head after her accident.
You know what, Mo?

But it was a closed-door meeting, so...
- Oh, come on.

Then you're right back on our side of the closed door.
Thanks for the advice.
- Shawn.

This is the only place that I could get you alone.
Well, until now it was the only place I could get some peace.
You've been avoiding me since the hospital.
You made it pretty clear you had some things to figure out.
So, when you figure them out, let me know.

Do you still love Andrew?
I love you, Shawn.
Look, we've had a lot of things thrown at us and it has been confusing.
And now with Andrew running,
- I just...

You had to know he'd run eventually.
Yeah, and now that he is, I can't just leave him hanging.
I...

Got it.
So you want me to postpone things while you do the dutiful wife on the campaign trail thing.
What if he gets elected?

Don't you realize there is never going to be a good time?
I just need to find a way out of this, and to do it in a way with the least amount of hurt for all of us.
So can you please just be patient with me a little longer?
I love you.

You're overreacting.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

- You were stressed.

Look, it was my fault too.
You weren't the one Maxine offered a second chance to.
The woman just came out of a coma.
You think she'd wants to be bothered with your crap?
Give it a little time, babe.

- Okay.

Does this colour make my lips look bigger?
Tandy, what are you doing here?
Why aren't you in school?
Mom said to take the day off.
- Tandy, you know that's not cool.

Well, Mom's an idiot, so I'm not sure how much good that will do.
You have to take responsibility for yourself.
Whatever.

So, she sent you here to ask me?
Plus, we needed to recharge our phone.
Wow.

Sent you here because she's too much of a screw-up to...
- Is that going to cover it?

Sorry, Kib.

No, don't you be sorry.

It's me who's sorry.

Yeah, me too.
Jason.

We are so happy to have you back.
Well, I'm happy to be back.
What can I do for you?
I just wanted to celebrate your return.
And?
You have a very suspicious mind.
Jason, you're the network president.
Flowers are never just flowers.

Your ratings.

And today?

The network's ecstatic.

Well, obviously, I can't recover from a life-threatening medical emergency every day.
But, I'll tell you what, if we start to slip, maybe I'll amputate something.
In all seriousness, this is a real opportunity here.
It's given the show a second wind.
I didn't realize we needed a second wind.
Well, it's a very competitive marketplace, Maxine.
We can't afford to sit on our laurels.
- We should talk strategy.

I need to get some rest.

And don't worry, I will be resting on my couch and not on my laurels.
I'll be in touch.
- My man.

Ah, so, it's good to have our girl back, right?
- Mm.

- Look okay?

Oh, come on now, Jason.

Is there a problem?
Okay, I'm just going to flat out say it.

Maxine and her ability to lead the show.
- Why?

She's been carrying the burden of this show for 12 years and she's had the pressure of keeping it from going stale.
You guys almost lost her.

- you should be looking at?

Then ease up on her.

You know, bring a little energy into it.
And I'm not saying that I need the extra work' but, you know,
I'm really good at shaking shit up.
- So that's what this is about.

What this is about is taking care of Maxine.
She's not going to let you know that she needs help.
She's not going to show you her weak side.
But what you need to do is open up your damn eyes' and see that she's in trouble.
Over my dead body will I let
Jason Abel babysit me on set.

Armani-ed little testicle is pushing the limit.
Glad to see your mother's back to her old self.
He's just here to evaluate things for a few days.
And you have to be reasonable.

They just wanna protect their asset.
Asset?

I quote, "How many more yapping women do we need on TV?"
And you proved them wrong.

- the gravy train running.

This show is your life.

- Ah, good morning, Jason.

Just checking in with our ladies.
Lovely to have you, Jason.

Justin Timmerman, oh, my goodness.

- He is so cute.

If you're going to have someone lecturing you about what you're doing wrong with your body, it may as well be someone fine.
Son of a bitch.

What?

Oh, never mind.

Quiet, please.
His controversial medical techniques, which experts claim are more harmful than helpful, are making headlines.
Please welcome the hunky healer,
Dr. Justin Timmerman.
- Welcome, welcome.

And I prefer MD over hunky healer.
Does MD stand for muscular doctor?
Now, Dr. Timmerman, you popularized cryotherapy claiming that cold therapy is more effective than prescription drugs.
Not just claims, Maxine.
If you look at the clinical research...
Well, um, you are being investigated, uh, by Congress because three of your patients...
Uh, I'm sorry, I don't usually need these but the noggin's a little tired after the last few days.
No apologies necessary.

- refer to as wakefulness.

Uh, I sometimes play that music in the operating room.

Uh, uh, but these, uh, these patients allege that you were involved with Britney Spears.

- Um, unfortunately no.

Perfectly understandable.

So, you're gay?
Uh, I don't like to discuss my sexuality.
I'm here to talk about my many advances in, uh, cryotherapy.
Uh, we will be right back.
And we're out.
Yeah.
It was good.
Mo, my office.

What the hell was that?
Oh, Leon must have grabbed the wrong cards.
Justin Timberlake is not on till next week...
Yeah, I'm aware of the schedule.
Look, there's a lot of scrutiny on Maxine right now.
- So unfair.

There's just one problem with that.

I don't get it.

He's got potential, and not everyone has a mother that can just give them a job.
Hey, so, good show.
I assume you're referring to the part where I didn't make an ass out of myself.
I'm sorry about the Leon thing.

Please.

The point is I know he's an idiot.
I should've checked my cards, then had a clue that our brain-surgeon guest hadn't dated Britney Spears.
Okay, so listen and please just keep an open mind.
Abel wants to cut you to three shows a week.
Cycle guest hosts on the off days.
- What?

After the boost we just gave this show?
Is nothing ever enough for these people?

Look, maybe you really could use the rest.
- Are you taking his side?

But he thinks you were in a coma the last five days and you were
- just off your game right now.

Point is, I was off my game and the network's not used to seeing me like that.
Come on, tomorrow's Friday.

Do the best show we can do and see if he backs off.
If not, you got some extra free time to yourself.
- To do what?

- Find a man.

Nina?
Knock, knock.
Oh, hey.
- Sorry.

It's your dressing room.
Well, I don't normally puke in trash cans.
Oh, shh.

It's okay.

You have?
During the third and fourth seasons of Spacey, it was happening like every day.
Oh, no, Kib, I'm not bulimic.
Oh.

- you're into...

I shouldn't have assumed.

Like what, are you pregnant or...
Oh, my God.
That's so great!

No, that's so horrible.

I'm sorry, I'm really bad at this.
You're so Lacey from Outer Spacey sometimes.
Uh, listen.
I don't want anyone to know about this yet.
I haven't even told Andrew.

Yeah, I won't.

Thanks.
Hey, guys!
- Mommy!

Oh, sorry I'm late.

Whipped through, like, 20 dresses that,
I have to admit, all looked amazing.
- I have pics.

Okay.
What?

It was just dresses, Brad.
No, Heather, if he wants to look at dresses, let him look.
The neckline on the coral one is sick.
Thanks, honey.

Did you eat?
You're joking, right?
We had dinner plans an hour ago.
We did?
Oh, God, to celebrate your endorsement deal.

- I don't know how...

You know, maybe with your show and your music, your book, your fittings, and general obsession with yourself, it's just hard to remember that something might be important to your husband like this stupid little dinner.
I resent that.
Excuse me?
Averline, take the kids to watch cartoons.
Come on.
People at work are starting to notice the bruises and
I'm not about to start wearing sister white gowns.

Wow, fancy.

I want to talk to you and this is in my neighborhood.
Well, we could've just met at your place.
Yeah, if I wanted you to know where I live.
Nice to see you too, daughter.
You seriously kept Tandy home from school so you could send
- her to ask me for more money?

Anyway, Tandy is smarter than both of us combined.
A day or two off of school, it's not going to kill her.
You know, you once told me you wish you had been a better mother to me.

Is that why I'm here?

To be told what a bad mother I am?
- To be lectured?

Do you think it's easy?

I have paid your bills since I was 12 years old and somehow that's still not enough to keep the lights on?
I think dinner was a mistake.
I need you to do a better job with Tandy.
Don't tell me what you need me to do.
I mean it, Mom, or I'll find a way to get custody.
Kibby, you can't even take care of yourself.

Have your probation officer help you come after me?
There isn't a court in this world that would award custody of a minor to someone like you.
Congressman.
Constituents.
Oh, you're already used to the title and you barely started the campaign.
Positive thinking.

- It's not the only way.

I was thinking a pregnant wife would be an asset to your campaign.
- I found a sperm donor.

- Now?

I am.
I was.
I thought I'd have a little more time to warm up to the idea, Nina.
Well, it's just I found someone really amazing and I'm excited and...
I thought we had a deal.
- One of many.

That's why we're really good for each other.
Okay.
Okay.
Fine.

I did a lot of research at the clinics and I found someone who I think is absolutely perfect: ivy educated, tall,
- handsome, athletic.

Will you at least be open if there's something that I want to pursue further?
Fine.

I'm in.
- She's such a bitch!

Why do you let her get to you?

Tandy, but she'll turn out okay, you did.
I'm an ex-substance abuser parolee screaming into a phone
- on the street.

Big diff.
Have a good workout with your friend.
- Trisha cancelled.

Wait, where are you?
Kibby.
Oh, I love the coral.
In fact, I was told by a very discerning critic that it was sick on me.
Is that a cross tattoo?
You're not going goth on me.
Okay, ladies, liquid orgasms before the weekend.

Come on, girl, you could use the sugar.
- You look like shit.

- Mm, love you too, bitch.

Fraud.
I just thought you guys might all want to know why his lattes are so good.
Those extra 45 minutes he's using to make them, he's probably just jerking off in the stairwell.
Fat chance of that.
- Is that whole milk?

Why not just inject butter into their veins?
Why is everyone so annoying?
Son of a bitch!

Move, bitch!

Hot!

Damn it!
Aren't you a little long in the tooth for a foam party?
Shut the hell up.

Mine too.

Okay, boss lady, you want to play with me?

Because I've got a good game I've been meaning to show you.
I'm a little busy running a show.
Alright, no worries.

I have a few notes for Monday's roundtable.

- Hey.

What's going on with the plan?
Oh, come on, Shawn, it's been, like, two days.
Yeah, and the patience you want me to have is wearing thin, not to mention the hiding.
One minute, we're pretending to be colleagues, the next minute we're making out in my office.

Well, it's not easy for me either, okay?
- It's complicated.

- What's so complicated?

What?

He can't.
Two minutes to places, everyone.

Alright, I need your phones, ladies.
Gum in Ramona's bucket.
Uh-uh, I'm going to need mine another minute.
Oh, have a good show, Maxine.

Watch it, Mo, your shelf life on the show is way past its expiration date.
It's not me you should be worried about.
I have insurance.

How did you get my medical records?

Oh, you want to call the police?
Mo, you better be very careful.
No, you should be very careful.
What will all of your viewers think if this leaked out all over the Internet and they found out that you have been lying to them this whole time about your naturally youthful appearance?
When the truth comes out about all this little nipping and tucking you've been doing, you're going to lose a lot of credibility.
Don't threaten me, Mo.
This is not a threat.

Live from our studios in New York:
Maxine, Kibby, Nina, Heather, and Mo,
- serving you The Lunch Hour.

Back to The Lunch Hour for another day.
Fresh out of a coma, and she looks amazing.
Maybe we should all take a little coma nap.
Well, there are other ways to
- look refreshed, right, Maxine?

Oh, finally, something we all can agree on.
We are tired of talking about your illness.
Well, what would you like to talk about, Mo?
Well, Maxine, you do not want to go there.
Oh, but I do.
I want to clear the air about one thing.
Just one?
Mo, I'm speaking now so, how about you shut up and let me talk?
Matter of fact, I'll make a deal with you.
If you go into a coma, I will devote an entire show to you.
This is not easy for me.
I, uh, I lied to all of you about something.
Um, and I'm embarrassed to tell the world that I didn't tell the truth about what really happened to me the day I went into a coma.
I was, uh, tempted and sorry to say succumbed to the pressures of aging in a youth-oriented world.
And... being over 35 is tough for any woman.
I was not in a medical facility for a throat surgery that day.
I was in a medical facility for cosmetic surgery.
- Holy shit.

Thank God, my body rejected the anesthesia and sent me into a coma.
Thank God, I was spared unnecessary surgery.
And, now, now I can continue to age the way I always have, naturally and gracefully, because what matters most is if we're really happy with ourselves.
I am embarrassed at my temptation, but there is no more perfect example of why I created The Lunch Hour, so that we could have honest communication.
And that's why I will be here for you every day, five days a week, so that women have the platform and the voice... to be free.
So, think we've got her under control now?
I'm going to say yeah... for now.
- Hey, Shawn.

- Hey.

We were just headed out.

Guess I'd better get used to them, huh?
Good show today, huh?

Yeah.
She, she sure does.
Uh, we never quite finished discussing my notes from Monday's roundtable.
But I guess it can wait till Monday morning.
- Thanks.

- Good to see you, alright.

Wait.

Yes, moron, when I reminded you it wasn't in the car right before I had to pay the bill because you forgot the company car.
Hey, you're the one who wanted to come.
That's because Shawn told me if you want to keep your job, I have to supervise you to keep you from screwing up.

No dick is good enough for this.
You and I both know that's not true, baby.
- Ah.

I will punch a hole in your face.
- I swear to God, Leon.

Well, did you not see the show today?
Maxine totally screwed me over.

And, by the way, they've promoted Ramona to head PA again.
Whatever.

I'd rather spend my energy coming up with segments.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold the train.
Now you're trying to be a producer?
Yeah.

You know what?
You millennials are a piece of work.
Memo to Leon, despite what your mommy and daddy told you growing up, nobody gives a damn about your ideas.
The sex tape was a pretty good idea.
It has been a hell of a day.

Don't push me.
Check it.
Mo to Mo.
You drive a car all around New York doing, like, hidden camera, man-on-the-street style interviews.
You are such an idiot.
How can I be man on the streets if I'm in a car?
Why don't you, um, run that by me again back here?
Ooh.
Can I get a little blush, Mommy?
Honey, no.

Do you hear yourself?
"It'll clog your pores"?

Shut up, Brad!
Is that really how you're talking to me right now?
Yes, Brad.

Averline.
- Cartoons.

It's so late and the children need to be in the bed.
Cartoons, Averline.
Get the book.
Ephesians 5:22.
"Wives, submit to your own husband as to the Lord.
For the husband is for the husband is the head of the wife."
Oh, I have flowers
- and champagne tonight.

Hey, Hector.
If you can cover the desk, I can help her with these.
Thanks.
Lilies are a very delicate flower.

Does Maxine Robinson live here?
We don't give out information on our residents.
I understand.

Are you a friend of Maxine's?
Wow.

- How long have you worked here?

Could I ask you a couple questions?
People in this building are very private.
Hmm.
I think you should be on your way.
Just a few questions, maybe two or three simple questions.
Next time on Daytime Divas...
Miss Kelly Osbourne.
Sometimes it's nice to change things up.
How about a new co-host?
- Don't go rogue on air again.

Who's Anna Krauss?
She used to be my assistant.
She's back in town, writing a book about you.
I'm running for office, Nina.
I'm doing everything I can to make sure I'm bulletproof.
Does he even know you're pregnant?
It could get ugly if I don't do this the right way.
I guess I'm triggered because I don't like secrets.
It was a long time ago, Maxine.
No one will find out what happened that night.
