We're about to pull a good job here, life-changing money.
Camp Pendleton... we're gonna hit it.
There is a ton of cash on that base.
I did coke with Craig, and then I fucked him.
- You and me gonna have a problem?

- I'm here for Craig.

- His mother.

Pope:

I know something happened.

I have something for you.

See, my mom... she hated them.
In the end, she's a Cody.

We risk our lives for $500.

Man, you get pissed off, you disappear for a few weeks, and then you come crawling back.

Guys, that job was a shit show, no question.
We're all pissed.

But the smart thing to do right now is to take a beat and just cool out.

Fine.

When she gets back, let's talk to her.
Let's tell her why things have to change.
Now she knows how fed up we are.

Calmly, with respect, we make her see she has no choice.
No.
