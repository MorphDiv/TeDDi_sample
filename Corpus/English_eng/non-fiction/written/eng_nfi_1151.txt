Hey, watch out!

Man, I'm hungry.
(all chattering)
Sad I had to specify "girl."
Are you okay?

All right, nobody touch her!
The doctor said she could explode at any moment!
Give birth, Danny.

I could "give birth" at any moment.
But I'm fine, all right?

Apparently it happens all the time.
Well, having been pregnant now for almost four hours,
I think I'd know for sure if a person was really about to crawl head first out of my body.
Oh, she'll know.

That chick from Alien will have nothin' on her, just... (makes explosion noise)
Mom!
Right, right, right.
But good news... the second one just pops right out.
One minute you're dancin' at a Bon Jovi concert, yeah... and the next, someone's all like, "Oh my gosh, who dropped a baby on the floor?

I can't believe they made me buy you a ticket.
Now are you sure that there is absolutely nothing we can get you?
I am feeling very maternal.
Well, I know it's late, but I am a little hungry.
- Maybe pizza?

But you know what would be even better?

Ooh!
Oh, no, I'm...

Yes, yes!

- (everyone talking at once)

They'll be back.
- Oh my, okay...

(theme music playing)
♪ It's amazing how the unexpected ♪
♪ Can take your life and change direction ♪
Are you done?
Yeah, I'm done.
- Are you done?

Oh, my...

I know the doctor said
I shouldn't do anything too strenuous, but do you think I could not do anything in my own apartment?
Well, what if we're all alone and I have to go to the bathroom or get some water?
What then, Riley, what then?
Ah, yes, what then?
You know, well, now that you mention it, um, I am a little thirsty.
Right.

Uh, hey, Ben.

You mind watchin' her while I go to the kitchen?
You got it.
We're back!
So cute.

Eh, you know, it was all right.
Mainly sat in the back with the only other cool mom and made fun of the awkward and ugly kids, so...
I was actually talking to my daughter.
- Oh.

So, how was dance class today?
Who's my mommy?
Wow.

Well, we talked about this, remember?
Her name's Angela and she lives in Los Angeles.
Why?
We just got lucky, I guess.
Ben!
I'm sorry, the books all say to be honest!
What's all this about, anyway?
Well, I'm guessing it has something to do with the mother/daughter talent show
Emma's class is having.
Mother/daughter talent show?
Okay, this is wrong on so many levels.
How dare they make Emma feel bad for only having a father.
That's my job.
Hey, hey, hey, all this anger and negativity is stressing Riley out.
Here.

Ahh!

How cold it is in here.
Uh, Danny, do you... do you think you could go get my blue blanket, and if you don't see it, just keep looking.
It's definitely real.
Got it!
Oh, hey, Ben!
You've gotta promise if anything happens, you'll be there for Riley.
You got it.

Oh wait, that was you!
Dude, I'm serious.
Brother to brother.
If I'm not there when the baby comes, you gotta promise to be there to take care of my wife and my son.
Yeah.

You hear that, baby?

Oh, hey, man, anything happening yet?
No, but I don't have time right now...
Oh, my god, I'm so happy for you.
Tucker told me about the false labor and I totally get how stressful that can be.

I got this sapphire ring.
I'm sorry, your what gift?
Push gift.

You got her one, right?
No...
Oh.

Way to start off on the wrong foot.
Babe, babe, babe... remember we talked about not saying everything that comes into your mind?
- Uh-huh.

- Oh.

No.

The baby's gonna come, and I'm gonna be standing there with nothing in my hand besides a used umbilical cord!
That's it.

Dude, what is the matter with you?
Man, you don't wanna pay retail.

Man, look, I'll hook you up, okay?

(giggles) Suddenly this necklace you got me doesn't seem so special.
Yes, I knew she'd start asking questions someday, but that's not what this is about.
It's about me not being enough for her.
Seriously, what does she need a mom for?
- There's nothing I can't handle.

Mom, none of those things are ever happening!
Okay, maybe it would be good for both of us if I had someone.
A partner.
A real mom for Emma.
Maybe I should've never stopped looking for Elle.
Yeah, why did you stop?
Uh, maybe 'cause every single time I ever mentioned her, you ridiculed and mocked me?
(scoffs) Well, if you're gonna let that stop you,
I'm surprised you can get out of bed in the morning.
It's hard!

You know what I'm gonna do?
I am gonna find Elle.
Okay, you do that.

But I'm goin' down to that dance studio.
There's no way they're stopping' me from dancing with my daughter.
Unless I have to wear tights.
I want people to see that I'm a good dad, but that's all I want them to see.
So where's your guy?
He'll be here, all right?
But remember... this is a negotiation.
A dance, all right?

Hey.

My associate.

Yeah.

Oh, that sounds really reasonable.
But there is no way that that is happening. (laughs)
To be honest with you, man, we only brought 200 with us.
Oh, no!

Plus I might have a little more in my wallet.
So, can I assume that... okay, yeah.
And I'll take the cell phones, too.
Yeah.

Oh... no, I got mine.

(phone ringing)
And how dare you make my little girl feel different?
- Ooh, hey, Benji...

I'm not emotionally equipped to deal with.
Ben...
Not now, Mom, this baby daddy's on a roll.
This should be about the children.
Okay?

And there's that one girl who's got two of each, which just seems like overkill.
Uh-huh.

And the girls are free to perform with whomever they choose.
Yeah, that's what I was trying to tell you.
I did not see that.
But it's good to know that you'll be incorporating some of my suggestions.
Hey... your name isn't Elle, is it?
Mom, I think I would know if she was Elle.
- Come on, let's get outta here.

The other cool mom and I are in a fight, and I don't wanna run into her.
Turns out the awkward kid I was makin' fun of was hers.
Is he here?

Is who here?
I don't know his name.

But if you could just give me the name and number of the guy who was just in here, that would be great.
No problem.

Right.

Of course, with my luck, he's probably married.
Oh, he is definitely not married.
Yes!

I knew he was single.

There's honestly nothing I can do.
Are you having a stroke?
No!

Oh... yeah, no, I don't have a kid.
But he does!

Yes.

Yeah, I'd lower those expectations a bunch.
Well, I did it!

- Well, I...

Hey, Emma, so it's not gonna be a problem anymore.
You get to dance with Daddy.
I want my mommy.
Okay.

That doesn't break Daddy's heart into a million pieces at all.
Welcome to the dark side of parenting.
Ohh!

The baby is coming!
- Oh, god!

(Ben chattering)
Hey...

My smartphone got lost.
Turns out it's not that smart.
It's fine, just be glad it was another false alarm.
Oh, by the way, I guess we need a car seat to take the baby home from the hospital.
Yeah, I read that in a pamphlet when I was just flashing my vagina to 12 med students.
Oh, we're on it.

I think I might've misplaced my wallet as well.
Hey, did you hear that?

Dude, I'm tellin' you right now, a car seat is a horrible idea.
No, I'm gonna get her the car to put it in.
Really?

If I don't get her a car, what am I supposed to get her?
And this is where your friend Tucker steps in, man.
While you were off endlessly measuring your wife's cervix,
I was coming up with the greatest push gift idea ever.
What do women like even more than jewelry?
Being right?
(elevator dings)
No... they like puppies.
I've got a guy.
Really?

A new puppy and a baby all in the same day.
She's gonna feel like the luckiest girl in the world.
Don't be upset.

Yeah, whatever, it's so not a big deal.

Are you sure you're okay?

Look... you know she totally loves you.
Honestly, I'm just glad my mom is doin' it.
Last place I wanna be right now is stuck at some stupid rehearsal with a bunch of screaming kids in tutus.
No-no.
What is it, Emma?
I wanna dance with you.
Me?

Well, heck, yeah, I'll dance with you.
See?

And if we hurry, we can be there in time for rehearsal.
Oh my gosh, this is gonna be so much fun.
And it seems I am being abandoned by a whole new generation.
And yet, I feel like somehow you had a hand in this.
(Scoffs)
I don't care what you say, but there is a good person in there.
A very small person, but she's in there.
- Beep, boop...

I have my moments.
And I'm going to continue my good deed tour and go find Emily.
- Don't you mean Elle?

That's a whole morning's worth of work down the crapper.
God!
(babbling in high-pitched voices)
(gasps) Oh... my god, that is the cutest puppy ever.
Oh, yes she is.
- Aww...

It's Riley's push gift.
It was my idea, but you know I'm lettin' him take the credit.
(laughs)
(laughing)
Oh, my god, are you serious?
You want Riley to take care of a baby and a puppy?
(Elevator dings)
Oh god!

Even I don't hate her that much!
(laughs) You are a dead man!
God!

Oh, man, Danny, I worry about you, you're slow, man!

- So, a car?

You ready?

Bam!

Well, you know what?

Oh, no, no, no, I did get a break when I had to help Ben find a costume, do Emma's hair, and make them lunch.
But I literally have no idea where my husband is, this thing is just tap dancing on my bladder, and g...

Who is that?
Well, it's a little anti-climactic now, but this... is Elle!
Hi!
- This is Ben's Elle?

- How did you do that?

So... do you remember Ben?
Well, um, no, not really, but... he sounds amazing!
- So you...

So is he here?
No, he's getting ready for the talent show.
Okay, let's go.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, you guys are not going anywhere without me.
Um, just get the chair from Ben's desk and start pushin'.
Oh, my god, we don't have the time.
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
Shut the door!

Hi, hi, I'm here.
I didn't miss it, did I?
No.

I put two pillows under a blanket so it looks like I'm still there.
That's the one useful thing you taught me.
Bonnie?
Oh.

What are you doin' here?
Honestly?

(laughs) At a mother/daughter talent show?
God, you're bad at this.
Ohhh!

The baby is really coming this time!
Wait, are...

Could you maybe just cross your legs for a couple minutes until we're done?
No, I can't just cross my legs, because someone is trying to crawl out of there.

Use the existing tunnel!
Oh!

Right!

What's wrong?

- Oh god, ow!

Okay, can't you just cross your legs?
I mean, we're all kind of in the middle of something.
(grunting, gasping)
All right, you know what, I will take her to the hospital, you go on with Emma, and just meet me there, okay?
I can't, I promised Danny...

Okay, and... send.
Okay, Emma?

But I really need to help your Auntie Riley deliver your new cousin.
I am so sorry, but Grandma will dance with you.
Okay?
Okay, okay.

Ben, I almost forgot.

- Really?

- Here?

Oh, my god, stop that.
That's really her!

Ahhhh!
Right.

- Okay, all right.

Okay.

It's showtime.

Five, six, seven, eight...
Dun-nah-dun-dun.
Wah-tah!

Ooh, g...

I have to say, these babies are so popular, we're actually chargin' a thousand over sticker.
That sounds fair.
(phone buzzing)
Oh, my god.

We gotta go!
- Hey!

Hang on!
- (crashing sound)

(clattering sound)
You know what?

I think...

Ohhh!
Ahhh!
Riley, you have to calm down.

Really?

Ahh!

The clinic's a little understaffed, but they paged someone, and worst case scenario, I've actually done this before.
You stay away from me!
I'm Dr. Ryan.

Oh, you know just a little bloating...

Oh, wow, right.
Yes, you are!

Wait.

It's really you.
My god, it's you!
I can't believe it!
I was just at a dance studio looking for you when I got paged.
I know, I saw you!

- I'm Elle.

- Right!

Good to know.

Uh, you can do this?

Well, not on an actual person, but it'll be fine.
So, you're a doctor?
Yeah.

Hey, maybe we can go out for a drink sometime?
Ahhh!
Oh, my god, just give us like two minutes?
I'm here!
The father?

Riley, here, hold my hand.
G...

- Ow!

(both screaming)
Okay, give me one more.
(both screaming)
(baby crying)
Is that it?

You did it.

I can't believe it's really you.
You were amazing.
No, you were amazing.
Hey, can we all agree that I was amazing?
Hey, little buddy.

I love him.
So do I.
And I love you.
Hey, since you're already gonna be watching one baby tonight, can you watch Emma, so I can go out with Elle?
So, Sweet Pea, you and I have to talk.
I'm startin' to realize that maybe I can't always be your everything, but I finally found that girl we saw nine months ago.
Now, I don't know what's gonna happen... but if I do it right... there's a chance that you might finally have a full-time mom.
What do you think?
I only need you, daddy.
I love you, sweetheart.
Well, little girl, it's good to know that we have each other.
Because no matter what happens, it's always just gonna be the two of us.
No, Brad, not every construction worker that is whistling is looking at you.
Hi, sweetie.
(all talking at once)
Oh my gosh...
Well, I take that back.
I don't think it's ever gonna just be the two of us.
(everybody talking at once)
Riley:

(chatter continues)
