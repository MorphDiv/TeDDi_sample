Sync and corrections by explosiveskull [theme music playing]
[Gus inhales deeply]
- Okay. [chuckles]

[Gus grunts] [both breathing heavily]
- Do you wanna go get a condom?

- Okay.

[both chuckle]
- [whirring] - [both chuckle]
[Mickey moaning]
Hey, can I get your Wi-Fi password?
Oh!

Oh, have I jumped out of stage there?
Yeah, I watched half that Edward Snowden documentary.
- And now I'm very careful.

- No, it's just easier if I type it in.

Hey, I liked waking up next to you this morning.
You're a peaceful sleeper.

Oh, yeah, I go into, like, a super deep trance zone.
- Yeah.

- Oh, no?

[groans] Fuck.

What did I say?
You were like, "I'm sorry, Brenda Blethyn."
- And then you started laughing.

I laughed?

Mmm, it was.

This is nice.
Yeah.
Wish we could just stay in bed all day.
- Why don't we, huh?

SLAA.
S-L-A-A, that's what they call it.
Ah!

- I get it.

What time is it?
[inhales] Now-ish?

- It's okay.

It's good that you're going.

Do you want, like... a fresh T-shirt or something?
[grunts] No, I'm good.

You sure?

Yeah?

- Here, this one should fit.

[sighs]
- I'm not tripping still, am I?

[chuckles] I'm not.
- Oh, that looks cute on you.

Hey, you know, you could come with me if you want to.
Really?

- Yeah.

No.

Yeah!

As long as you won't get bored.
No.

Have you ever seen those?
Uh, really, it's funny, seeing fucked-up kids.
- [snorts] - [Gus chuckles]
Ugh.

[sighs]
Mom, how's it goin'?
Is Dad around?
An estate sale?
That's cool.
This is embarrassing, but I don't remember your name.
[scoffs]
Jorie.

- Short for Marjorie.

Okay... this may be against the rules or whatever, but...
Yeah?

I hung out with this guy last night... and now I really wanna spend the day with him.
Is that not cool?

All right, well, were you honest with him about SLAA?
- Yeah.

Yeah.

He's almost too cool with it.
Yeah.

Really?

I...

The program is about learning to be in a healthy relationship.
And just because you are new doesn't mean you have to walk away from something good because of bad timing.
Fuck timing.
Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I gotta go to spin class.
The road to self-improvement is never ending.
- Bye, Jorie.

- Hey.

How's it going?

Or, uh, can I not...
I don't know what I'm allowed to ask.
- It was good.

- Thank you for asking.

Cool.

- Yes, Mom.

All right. [chuckles]
I just wanna know about you and your new friends.
If they're coming over, let me know, and I'll pick up some sodas beforehand.
Do you, uh... wanna get some food?
Yeah.

Yeah.
We can do that.

[sniggers]
What?
I just saw you do your mirror face.
- My mirror face?

[chuckling] Yeah.
- Yeah.

- [laughing]

Oh, just you wait.
There's gonna come a day when I catch you doin' your mirror face.
I am gonna relish that shit.
[Mickey] Oh, my God.
- You see that building right there?

That's where my first job in LA was.
- Really?

I was an assistant to this publicist who repped the entire cast of The Hills.
Oh, that's cool.
Mmm, no.

Isn't that the point of the show?

Not in real life.
Not when Justin Bobby shows up at your house in the middle of the night crying 'cause he's the only one who wasn't included in the spread in Teen Vogue.
[chuckles]
Oh, Justin Bobby.
You have no idea who I'm talking about, do you?
No.
- That makes me like you so much more.

[Mickey] Do you ever think,
"What would I do if there was an earthquake right now?"
[Gus] Oh, yeah, all the time.
I guarantee you and me will experience, like, a huge earthquake at some point in our lives.
- Really?

Yeah.

We haven't had, like, a true crisis in Los Angeles in years.
- Mmm-hmm.

- So we're due up for disaster.

Well, if there is an apocalyptic event, I will not be helpful.
I will almost certainly make things worse.
Mmm.

Oh, yeah?

- Immediately kill myself.

Smart.

[Gus] Hmm, jump off the roof of The Grove parking lot.
So you didn't grow up with, like, a dream of becoming a teacher?
No.

I was always, like, obsessed with, like,
TV shows and movies and stuff.
I even memorized which studios made which movies.
Oh, my God, why?
To impress girls, obviously.
Forrest Gump.
[gasps] Okay, uh, Paramount.
- Mmm.

- Um, Fast and the Furious.

- First Wives Club.

- Silence of the Lambs.

- La Dolce Vita.

Did you say, "Cocktail"?

"Cocktail"?

- Still impressive.

Plus, I feel like I just got a window into the life of 14-year-old Gus.
Yikes!
Gus Cru-shek?
- Oh, right here.

- Are you not gonna correct her?

[boy] I don't wanna go to swim class.
[man] You have to go.

Cost 300 bucks for that whole package.

- [woman] Why don't you want to go...

That is such a classic, passive-aggressive dad move.
That reminds me of my dad when we'd go out in public and he'd yell at us.
- You know, just restrained and angry.

Yeah.

- Yeah.

We always ordered dessert, no question.
Oh, really?

We were kind of rich when my dad was still employed.
Hmm.

[both chuckle]
But if we had lived in a big city, you know, like, LA or New York, we would've been totally dirt poor.
- Yeah.

Especially with four kids, so...
- Did you have siblings?

- Bobby Dobby.

And, uh, what's, uh... [sighs] What's Bobby Dobby do now?
Lives in Tucson.

Fuck, I can never remember the boy's name.
- Your nephew?

- You don't remember your nephew's name?

In my defense, he's, like, three years old, so he hasn't made that big of an impression on me.
And the last time I saw him, he told me that my head looked like a butt.
[both chuckle softly]
What about you?

Oh, both. [inhales sharply]
I have an older brother, uh, Ken, who's the perfect kid.
- Wait.

- What?

He still lives in my hometown, Brookings, with his family, so my parents love him.
I mean, that makes sense.
And then, I have a...

Then I have a youngest sibling.

Whatever.

- Really?

He's just, like, moody, and when we were growing up, he would, like, smoke pot, and break curfew and... get away with it, which drove me insane.
Andrew's my hero.
I...

- Thank you.

No.

- You don't have to do that.

I'm happy to, really.
I'm gonna be honest, I was kinda doing the slow motion move for my wallet.
- Yeah, I noticed.

You were moving pretty slow there.

- [laughs] I got you next time.

Okay.

So, um... [clicks tongue] what are you doin' now?
You wanna keep hangin' out?

- I'm not getting sick of you.

You wanna... go to a movie or something?

Yeah.
- So, what's your go-to snack?

Maybe a...

Oh, my God.

Okay, uh... blah, blah, blah.
We're pretending, we're pretending.
Who are we trying to avoid?
Oh, God.

- I cannot deal with him.

Don't look at him.

Hey, buddy, want a little popcorn with that butter?
Geez Louise.
He's putting on a lot of butter.

Okay, he is going...
He is gone.
- Oh, thank God.

How did you meet, uh...

- Dustin.

He used to manage my friend's band.
- That's cool.

Turns out, it's only cool-adjacent, which suits him perfectly.
Mmm.
[sighs]
Were you crying during the movie?
- No.

- Mmm...

Come on, gimme a break.
Father-son stuff always really gets to me.

But he was a terrible father.
He didn't start caring about his son until he followed in his footsteps and became a bounty hunter.
No, he wanted to be a good father, he just couldn't be.
- That's, like, why I was so sad.

You know what makes me cry during movies?
When a character faces death with dignity.
That's some real Terms of Endearment shit.
- Oh, yeah, exactly.

- Hey, it's okay that you cried.

It could also be the shrooms.
'Cause sometimes people are emotional the day after they take them.
I appreciate how much you're trying to help me, but I would've cried regardless.

Okay. [chuckles]
Um, I'm gonna pee.
- Do you mind holding this for me?

- I don't wanna pee all over it.

- All right.

Mickey.
Oh.

- Oh, sorry.

I'm glad I ran into you.

Okay.
They were tenting my place for termites.

And then I saw you that night and you were an easy target...
Anyway, I'm...

- Whore?

I'm very sorry. [clears throat] That's not who I am.
I mean, it's who I was in that moment... but I shouldn't have said that.
Thank you.

[smacks lips] So... here alone?
Uh, yeah, you?
No.

Oh.

No, just a guy I see movies with.
Mmm, mysterious.
How's the dog?
- You mean our dog?

I clearly remember giving up parental rights.
[laughs] Um, he is good.
I just took him downtown for the blessing of the animals.
- You wanna see a picture?

- [Mickey] Oh, my God.

He is so cute and so old.
- Yeah, look at this.

- [chuckles]

Oh, my God.
- Hey.

- Dustin, this is Gus.

- Hey.

- And that is his dog Buster.

Ah, look at that cutie. [chuckles]
He takes after you.

- [laughs] Yeah.

What are you kids doing today?
I don't know.
I guess, we're just kinda playing it by ear.
- Making it up as we go along.

How's your Sunday going?
Uh, it's fine.

I gotta run, 'cause I do have plans.
- Okay, cool.

- Have a nice day, kids.

Nice to meet ya.
Hey, I know I'm not supposed to like him, but I kinda do.
Well, he was a huge asshole to me the last time I saw him, but...
Oh, should I have been meaner to him?
Do you want me to online bully him or anything, or... [laughing]
No, no, he... actually, just apologized to me, weirdly.
- I was...

- kind of impressed.

He was, uh, freaking out at me and accusing me of cheating on him, which I kind of did.
Okay.
But we were basically broken up.
And he was always out of town, and I would never do anything like that anymore because that's not who I am now, with SLAA, and you're nothing like...
Whatever.

Because if I was with Dustin now, then I wouldn't be here with you.
That's sweet.
Here we go.
[car lock beeps] [sighs] All right.
[scoffs] Okay, I gotta ask.
Why do you always have a beach towel in your backseat?
Uh...

It's kind of a aspirational thing, like...
I hope that one day I can go to the beach and use that towel.
So you've never actually used it?
No.

- Let's go right now.

Yeah.

Okay.
Let's give this towel the best day of its life.
All right.

- [Mickey sighs] Okay.

I gotta admit.

[Gus] Yeah.
[Mickey] It's the best day I've had in a long time.
Yeah, me too.
It's funny though, when something like this is, like, going really well...
I get, like, super nervous, like,
"Oh, when is something bad gonna happen and it's all gonna end?"
- Ya know?

[sighs]
What's the worst thing you've ever done?
[sighs heavily] Seriously?
We're gonna find it out eventually, may as well get it over with.
All right, that makes sense.

You go first.
Um, let me think.

If you can't think of it right away, you've never done anything that bad.
No, I'm just stalling, trying to come up with a way not to tell you this.
You can't.
Okay.

When I was in college,
I went to this party and I got, like, super wasted, and then everybody started daring me to...
- take a shit in my hand.

And, um...

- I...

And then I, like... walked around the party for, like, an hour, just, like, carrying this turd in my hand and introducing it to people, like,
"Hey, meet my friend Doody Garland."
Yeah, I can't play this game with you.

You can't do that.

Just tell me your fifth-worst thing.
[Gus] Okay.
All right.

- No, thank you, sir.

- You have to.

It's super polluted, and it's really cold.
My mom sent me this whole article about how all the city's run-off ends up in the ocean.
It's a health hazard.
We came all this way to be at the beach.
You don't just climb up to the tower and not ring that bell.
Let's get in there.

This is being at the beach.

No, being at the beach is getting into the ocean.
What if we go in there, we get a disease and die?
Come on, there's billions and trillions of gallons of water in there.
If you get E. coli...
I'll buy you ice cream.
I'm not dressed for it!

Okay.

You tell the towel that we came all this way just to sit in sand and not go into the water.
- Come on.

- But I'm only putting my toe in.

- Toes only.

Awesome!

Come on, come on.

You should never make a woman do things she doesn't wanna do.
[laughing] Don't make me sound awful.
- [laughs]

Okay, come on.
Right.

- [Mickey] All right.

That's good.

All right.
Wait for it.
- All right.

[Mickey] God, here it comes.
- Oh, no.

- [Mickey screams] - [laughing] Yeah!
It happened!

We didn't think it would.

So, uh...
What you up to this week?
So, like, I wanna text you... [inhales sharply] but I don't wanna pester you or annoy you.
We don't have to do this.
What?

I'm not gonna disappear on you, Gus.
Text me whenever.
I always wanna hear from you.
You're not going to annoy me.
You're not gonna annoy me either.

I like you.
[softly] I like you too.
Okay.
- Bye.
