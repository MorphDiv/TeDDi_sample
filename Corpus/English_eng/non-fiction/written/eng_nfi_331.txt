Didn't feel it.
Stewart's such a freakin' beast!
Dude, i'm laser-focused.
If i can show coach what i'm capable of,
I got a shot at varsity next year.
I'm the fastest kid in the whole school.
All right, boys, listen up.
Great training camp.
Squad's looking real strong this year.
Stewart, your chest is bleeding.
No, it's not.
Yeah, it is.
No.
Okay, that's what i'm talking about!
Yeah.
As long as we keep raising banners,
We're untouchable!
Lockwood owls, baby!
You're the freakin' man, pierce!
Now, as a thank you for a kickass training camp,
Us seniors have a little present
To keep all of you guys, uh, motivated.
Gentlemen Check your phones.
That picture comes to us from the legendary robby ragosa,
Who's playing d1
At virginia, smokin' goals
And smokin' girls.
Wait, why is there no face on mine?
There's no face on any of 'em, doof.
It's a freakin' sext.
Oh.
Look at that body.
And, oh, that tattoo.
Unicorn.
Mr. Pemberton.
Where-where am i...?
Damn, alba, how many cars
Other people worked very hard to be able to buy those cars,
They're ours, and i want you to be
Behind the wheel, i am a slave
Just clean up your act or else
I need you to sign this.
The lacrosse team was passing around some pic
Of some naked chick after practice.
Off to a creepy start.
Then principal gibbons just pops out of nowhere
Of the honor board and tell 'em who else was involved.
What's an honor board?
it's a committee of students and teachers
That handle disciplinary matters.
Sounds like a committee of narcs and rats
That handle snitching matters.
On your college applications.
Well, i know i got to go in front of the stupid honor board
With larry flynt here.
This is not a joke.
All right, if i rat out my teammates, they'll destroy me.
And if i don't, principal gibbons will just crap
Will you listen
To yourself? "just tell the truth."
Let me tell you a little story about a guy
I grew up with who just told the truth.
But he got pinched with a whole backseat
Filled with bootleg poison tapes.
Then he wound up a few days later in the back
Of a garbage truck, getting crushed
Until his guts shot out of his butt like a tube of toothpaste.
He should hear this.
Chip, listen to me,
Don't make this a thing, okay?
No, actually, don't listen to her.
I'll handle this, all right?
And what if you don't?
Then you shut your mouth and you do your time like a man, bitch.
Wrong with these people?
Okay, benito, let's go.
Excuse me!
You waited too long, my friend.
Come on, benito.
Mmm.
you tried to trick me,
But that is blueberry.
Mmm.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Not the rolls.
Benito, did you see who did this?
Yep.
I don't want to be butt toothpaste.
Um...
Principal gibbons?
Chip pemberton's aunt.
Oh, and thank you for denting my hood.
Well, there was an incident...
And i'm pretty sure you get it, too.
But is this really a fair position to be putting him in?
Of our institution is ensconced in our values.
And when these values swing askew,
There are protocols in place to right the ship.
We don't have protocols, 'cause we aren't nerds.
But we do have values,
And one of them is you don't snitch.
Look, it's not up to me.
I heard all about your little honor board.
And let me tell you about a guy i knew growing up
Who was also very honorable.
Hey, chip, do you believe in god?
What?
Hey, chip.
Hey, sabrina.
That picture, he's gonna cancel the honor board
And save you the public humiliation.
How is this good news?
Then everyone's gonna call me a traitor like you.
Chip, take the deal.
Hey, chip!
Come over here, man.
Don't do it.
Later, traitor.
Take a seat, man.
So i heard gibbons nabbed you yesterday.
Who's that girl?
We got to get him a nickname, quick.
I love it.
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow night?
Want to come by the pit?
Are eighth graders even allowed there?
You'll be with us.
We'll see you there, beaver dog.
You da man, b-diddy.
I am the man.
Yo, grab our trays!
Tell me who scratched the car.
Okay.
Mmm.
Delicious.
Mmm.
But mickey said...
Mickey isn't here.
I am!
Me.
Your best friend.
So,
What's it gonna be?
Oh, it's like that, huh?
Okay.
That is fine.
I didn't want it to come down like this,
But you leave me no other choice.
Oh, no, no, no, okay, okay, okay, benito, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
shh.
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is this what you want?
You-you can't breathe?
Oh, you help me, and i help you.
Talk!
Good boy, benito.
that's right, breathe.
Nice, nice.
Okay.
Tell me everything.
That's it?
Can i have cake now?
Yes.
Enjoy your cake.
Hey, guys?
Pierce?
Anyone here?
Over here.
Hi, chip.
I've been waiting for you.
I knew you'd come.
It's juice.
Gross.
Okay.
Cool.
You gave it stripes.
What...
Oh, i destroyed it.
He says that it's not up to him
What happens to chip.
He says it's up to you.
It is not up to me.
There's an entire honor board that decides.
Well, you better figure something out,
Because if you don't,
It's a little machine, and you stick it into your computer.
Oh, it's your entire hard drive.
And i've got a feeling
It's not all that honorable.
oh.
Oh, i was right.
I want you to listen to me right now.
Yeah...
You were just gonna snitch on me.
That's called extortion, stupid.
Hey, guys.
Hi.
Hey, looking good.
Hey, man.
Beaver dog has arrived.
What's the matter, chippy?
Pine cone got your nuts?
Ooh, freakin' geno pinero!
Hey,
What the hell are you doing here?
Lax guys invited me.
Chip, those guys are just covering their own asses.
They don't even like you.
I don't think they'd call me beaver dog
If they didn't like me.
What?
The guys gave it to me.
Chip, as easily as i can save you in this world,
I can destroy you.
And that is exactly what i will do
If you don't go home right now.
Beaver dog!
You've got to be kidding me.
'sup, sabrina.
You coming to the brunswick game?
Tool.
Your sister needs a hug, man.
Yeah.
You guys sure it's okay i'm here?
So if anybody messes with you, just, like, let us know, okay?
Okay.
I mean, geno pinero
Just kind of smoked me in the nuts with a pine cone.
Oh, with a dong like that, you'd think he'd be happier.
Yeah.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it, okay?
I'm thinking monkey business?
Done.
What's "monkey business?"
Just step back.
He's got to find it.
Yeah.
Ooh.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
What the hell, man?
And you messed up, because that's chip's monkey, okay?
No, it's not okay, chip.
Whose monkey are you sorry for hitting, pinero?
I'm sorry for hitting chip's monkey.
I'm sorry for hitting chip's monkey, just get off of me.
You good, bro?
You're lucky my boy's got a good heart.
Don't let me catch you beating up on monkeys ever again.
Now get out of here.
Lax for life?
Lax for life.
Come on, we have to feed him after this.
Nice work today.
It's been a big day for you, huh?
Crap sean hawkins wasn't the target
Used to be mom's suit, now it's my suit.
Get the hell out of here.
ugh.
Hope you have a plan.
Yeah, i'll pop 'em in or something.
No, i was up all night
Watching prep school movies in preparation.
I got scent of a woman, dead poets society,
Uh, deep blue sea,
It's a good thing you're not a jew,
Because that seems to be quite the deal-breaker in this world.
Let's go stomp on those jew-hating bastards.
Okay.
It's this way.
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Ugh.
This is even sicker than i thought.
There is some real evil
Illuminati-type vibes in here, right?
The hell are those?
My notes.
Oh, god.
We gather,
As so many before us have,
As i was saying, we are here in search of the truth.
Now, is there a board member who feels compelled to begin...
Chip,
Would you categorize yourself as popular?
I'm on the lacrosse team, so, i'm popular.
Nope, nope, nope.
Yes.
The lacrosse team, and proud we are
Of all they do for our school.
Typically, there isn't much interaction
Between middle school and varsity players,
Though that isn't true in your case, is it?
I-i guess not.
Your speed.
Yes, i'm sure they're
All enamored with your speed.
He is very fast.
Oh, please don't.
I know because i raced him once.
All right.
I-i did win, but that's...
Because i'm also very fast.
Chip...
Who sent you the photo?
Uh...
I don't know.
Well, no, it wasn't mine.
Obviously, it didn't appear...
Chip, it's come to my attention
That you were recently given a nickname.
Would you please share said nickname with the board?
Beaver dog.
Couldn't quite catch that, chip.
I've been around, you know.
There was a time
I could see and i have seen.
Brendan carthas.
You want to ask him
About snitching?
'cause he's dead.
Okay, can we please get to the point?
Oh, i'm just getting warmed up.
Now, i don't know
If chip's silence is right or wrong,
But this is bigger than us.
That indian guy outside the bodega,
Pocketing ten bucks to get you a porno mag, he's gone.
He's long gone, and he's left us
To spin inside this sticky web of technology
And swiping.
Hey, don't swipe me, man.
What in god's name are you talking...
You think they wanted the sharks to get smarter?
It just happened...
And they all got eaten because of it.
Are we gonna eat this boy?
Do you all want
To eat this boy because someone gave him something?
You hear that?
"nah."
And now you want him
To sell out his unquenchable sexual appetite
And his integrity?
I got news for you, friends.
Neither one are for sale.
This young man
Chooses honor.
He chooses life.
He chooses lust.
We are but food for worms, gentlemen.
Worms.
I think it's best
We take a short recess,
So we can all process what has been said here today.
You're welcome.
Ugh, get away from me!
No, but you were...
You... no, no, no!
As soon as everyone is seated
I want them out of here!
I didn't do it!
Leave!
That minivans are for soccer moms and pedophiles.
No, the other thing.
That i can never
Tell anyone about this.
That's right.
I'm not a snitch.
I know...
But i'm gonna need you to prove it.
Torch that son of a bitch.
Okay.
Okay.
Good.
Good boy.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
You know, benito,
If anyone ever messes with you, like a teacher or a coach,
Then you can snitch, okay?
Okay.
Good boy.
i like fire.
I know you do, benito.
I know you do.
What'd everybody do today?
Nothing.
Yeah.
Hey.
How'd your first game on varsity go?
How do you think it went?
Thanks to me, we had all our best players expelled.
Real weird energy in here today, huh?
