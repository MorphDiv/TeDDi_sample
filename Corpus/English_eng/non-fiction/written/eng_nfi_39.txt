What's up, y'all?
It's a beautiful night in New York.
Always like rocking for my hometown.
Back in the days, Flash told us:
"Conquer your street, conquer your park, conquer your neighborhood and the world is yours."
We did that for a whole year, and we did that for free.
Until the fall of 1978 and that's when everything changed.

Dear Yale admissions board:
My name is Ezekiel Figuero.
From the outside looking inside at my bonafides, one could say I'm duality personified.
By day, I'm a senior at South Bronx High.
But by night, I'm known to rock the mic.
♪ Yo, yo, MC Books in the building Slipped in cleverly ♪
♪ So deadly Plus the flow's heavenly ♪
Too conceited.
Doesn't elicit sympathy.
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."
Dickens' opening to A Tale of Two Cities is an apt assessment of my love life this past year.
♪ Oh ♪
- ♪ Come set me free ♪ - ♪ Oh ♪
On the one hand, my girl became a disco star and I love her.
But on the other, everybody damn else loves her, too.
Give them that hood shit.
All that intellectual yearning and shit.
All right.
To grow up in the ghetto is to wrestle daily with dichotomy and duality.
For example, I'm an orphan, half black and half Puerto Rican.
And these shoes I put feet in and the place that I'm seated ain't where I'm sleeping.
Where I break bread and at night lay my head... you might wake up dead.
That's just the South Bronx, B.
But I'm not just Bronx.
I'm Manhattan also, see?
And I wonder, when they look, what my coworkers make of me.
Mayor Koch, he only saw half.
Voice of the ghetto is what he sold me as.
This right here is the future of the South Bronx.
So, I think it's fitting that a future leader of the South Bronx gets to do the honors.
Come.
Thank you.
But look closely, Yale, past tragedy.
Because my home... is fucking magic.

Good evening and welcome, brothers and sisters of the dancing persuasion.
From station to station, and across the nation, I am Cool Calvin Moody, here to shake your booty.
It's time now to hustle, bump and get platinum,
Platinum Boogie.
A bit of bad news first.
As you know, Misty Holloway was to be a guest on the show, but she caught a case of the sniffles.
But fear not, we've got America's favorite party boys, The Village People.
And filling in for Misty, an angelic mystery guest.
You heard her holy voice, but may not know the heavenly face.
But what a voice and what a face.
Tonight, Platinum Boogie is proud to spread God's love with Mylene Cruz and her Soul Madonnas.
But first, funk soul superstars.
That's right, Earth, Wind  Fire.

Girls, it's the chance of a lifetime.
But how can I replace the biggest star in the world?
What if I flop?
Mylene, how long have I been your AR man?
I'm just scared.

This is my 18-minute "Disco Biscuit" sex electric remix, which I want you to debut in your Manhattan roller disco.
Um...
Yeah, I think this song is a little more suitable for those regions.

Damn right she got a boyfriend.
Um...

That shit was cold, man.
Yeah, not for long, baby.
Well, my favorite singer ever is Misty Holloway.

That's a lovely song.
Or maybe "Love to Love You, Baby."
Or "Shake Your Groove Thing."

I also love all the church songs, too, Mr. Moody.
