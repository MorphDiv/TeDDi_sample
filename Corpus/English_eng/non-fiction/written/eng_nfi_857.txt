I... killed Ji Soo... and Ha Yeon.
I did it.

I did it.
Why would you kill yourself?
You didn't do it.
It was me.
What?
You didn't do it.
I did it.

Seong Kyu.
There's a cat in a mountain valley
A baby kitten
There's a cat in a mountain valley
A baby kitten
Who are you?
Jeong Woo.
Who are you?
Who... are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
I asked who you are!

- Inmate 3866.

- Let him go.

- What's wrong with you?

- I asked who you are.

- Inmate 3866, what's going on?

- Who are you?

- Hey.

- Inmate 3855.

I'm asking you a question.

Seong Kyu.

Who on earth are you?
Lee Seong Kyu!

Let go of me.

Lee Seong Kyu!

Seong Kyu.
If he was going to cause a scene, he should've done it earlier.
Seong Kyu.

What does he want you to answer?
I am in the dark as much as you are.
Why does he have to do this in the middle of the night?
Wait a second.

What's going on?
Officer!

Lee Seong Kyu.

Have some coffee.
Thank you.
I bet you know all about the law if you were a prosecutor.
I have a question for you.
Ask me.
- It's about an abduction.

- Yes.

People do commit crimes over the course of their lives.
However, there are three crimes one must not commit.
What are those?
The first one is murder.
The second one is rape.
The third one is an abduction.

I only asked because I was curious.
You shouldn't even be curious about it.
Okay.
They'll pass a sentence tomorrow.
If things go well, will I be released?
Lee Seong Kyu.
(Innocent Defendant)
Well done.

Take a look at your contract for the apartment in New York and documents.
- Thank you.

- continue the search?

If the body doesn't turn up, do you plan on staying here?
A prosecutor like you wouldn't have been able to get the position.
- Deputy Prosecutor.

It's not like you are as competent as Jeong Woo.
Your family isn't exactly respectable, either.
Hey.

Prosecutor Kang.
If the search continues, the public might think she's alive.
You should end it when the time's right.
I'm sorry.
I will find her body and send her back to her family.
Goodness.
Kang Jun Hyuk.
Why did you keep Jeong Woo's confession from the first trial?
- Chief Prosecutor.

Why are you fussing over a settled case?
Isn't this enough for him to receive disciplinary action?
He said he did it in order to ensure Jeong Woo's punished properly.
It's not all bad.
It's a way to vindicate we didn't favor him because he worked here.
This is an exemplary example of giving favors to whom works here.
You did it to ensure he is punished properly?

You held back information in Jeong Woo's case, not just anyone's case.
- Are you hiding anything else?

Prosecutor Kang, you may go.

Yes, Sir.
Jun Hyuk.
It's not too late.
Jun Hyuk.
Find Ha Yeon.
Just find Ha Yeon for me.
I will announce the verdict.
I hereby sentence Lee Seong Kyu... with 5,000 dollars of fine for not taking measures... after an accident... according to the Road Traffic Act Article 54, Section 1.
(Court 17)
Park Jeong Woo, an ex-prosecutor accused of killing... and deserting his own family was sentenced to death... even on his appeal.
A capital punishment was sentenced because he was charged... with Park Ha Yeon's murder although her body was not found.
What do you think?
Pardon?
About the prosecutor who killed your brother.
He was sentenced to death.
I heard, too.
How can he kill his family?
I don't understand.
What do you think the reason is?
I'm not sure.
Also, his daughter's body was not even found.
I'm sure the court ruled fairly.
- Take a seat.

- You can take it.

It's Cha Seon Ho.
He's gone.
What?
It looks like he went somewhere else.

Yes, okay.

Yes.
I'm sorry.
What is it?
It's something menial.
Something menial may... come back to bite you.
You should be cautious.
Yes.
He was in the same cell as Seong Kyu.
Yes, President.
Where is Inmate 3866?
Where do you think?
After I received your call this morning,
I kept him in the punishment cell.
Don't ever take him out of there until I tell you so.
You can't let him take... any interviews, visitors, or phone calls.
Sure.
That's nothing difficult.
What an insolent fellow.
Does he think I'm his servant?
Inmate 3866.
- Should we go and see him?

Where on earth did he find this?
Darn you, Park Jeong Woo.
Did you get your memory back?
Excuse me.
Lee Seong Kyu.
Officer.
May I make a phone call?
Officer!
Officer.
A phone call?
Thank you.
- Here.

Inmate 3866.
Your appeal is over.
You should get used to living here.
You could make calls in your own time... only when you were a prosecutor.
I understand.
Just one call.
Please, I ask of you.
Keep your eyes on him.
Yes, Sir.
(President Cha)
Darn it.

What was that?
Where was it?
I heard that from somewhere.
Where?
(On the day of his arrest)
Dad.
Dad.
Ha Yeon?
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon!
Ha Yeon!
Ha Yeon!
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon, Ha Yeon.
- Ha Yeon!

- Ha Yeon.

Aren't you there?
Yes, it's me.

Ha Yeon, I'm here.
Dad.

Ha Yeon, I'll be there soon.
Can you wait?
Dad.

Come quickly.
I'll be there soon.
I'll be there quickly.
- Is Mom coming, too?

Mom?
Mom is...
Mom is little sick.
Is she sick?
Just a little.
So Ha Yeon, be brave and wait for us.
Okay.
Ha Yeon.
When that day comes,
- we'll go and get a kitten.

I promise.
Dad, are you crying?
No.
No, no.

Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon.
My dear Ha Yeon, do not cry.
Can you wait until that day?
Yes.

Okay.
I will be...
I will be there soon.
I will be there.
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon!
Who are you?
Who are you?

Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
You should confess... if you want to let Ha Yeon live.
Ha Yeon, you have to live.
I'm sorry.

Jeong Woo.
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon.
I remember.
I remembered.
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon.
Mom.

Tae Soo.
Your neighbor called.
She called to say that you collapsed in your restaurant.
Tae Soo.
I had a dream.
Jeong Woo said something strange.
He didn't do it, right?

Lee Seong Kyu.
Lee Seong Kyu.
Seong Kyu.

Jeong Woo.
I have to get out this time.
How will you come up with the money for the transplant?
You said your parents are out of the picture.
You said you ran a lot of gambling parlors.
Don't you have sacks of money buried somewhere?
Hey, you.

Seong Kyu.
If I still had businesses, I could have given you the money instantly.
But I'm here.

- You should've buried the money.

Gambling is as pointless as dogs' poo
That's fine.
I just need to get out this time.
(Investigation Report)
Lee Seong Kyu.
It was 901216 and 11... (Lee Seong Kyu)
What was it?

It was 901216... and 11...
It was 901216 and 11...
Officer!
Officer.
Officer.
Tae Soo.
Tae Soo.
Shut it.

I have to save Ha Yeon.
Shut your mouth, you scum.
I need to save Ha Yeon.

I told you to shut your mouth.
Please let me make a call.
Ha Yeon.
Ha Yeon.
Park Jeong Woo.
Is it really over?
Eun Hye.
How many days has it been?
This isn't your first time you lost a case.

- Aunt.

It was different this time.
What was so different about this case?
I didn't tell you this, but I wasn't so thrilled... you defended a man who killed his wife and daughter.
He's the murderer, right?
Look.

If his own attorney can't claim his innocence, then who will?
Aunt.

Look at your desk.

What has gotten into you?
(Attorney Resignation Form)
You already drew up the resignation form.

Submit the form immediately and forget about this case.
He isn't your only client.

I wonder if Inmate 3866 is okay.
Isn't he staying in the punishment cell a bit too long?
That's true.

One, two, three, four...
Goodness.

It's unlike you to worry about him.
You just said you were glad the cell got spacious for you.
- Anyway, is it true?

Has everyone around you deceived you?

- What are you talking about?

Everyone with a skirt looks beautiful to you.
I'm telling you the truth.

- She smells nice?

I will get going.
Really?
Goodness.
I can't wait any longer.
- Are you Cheon Pil Jae?

You can just call me Moongchi.
- How is it?

That's fine.
Someone ought to find me beautiful.
- Do you feel any pain anywhere?

Would you like to test it?
Goodbye.
She's absolutely stunning.

What am I going to do?
- All right.

- What's next on our schedule?

In the afternoon, art therapy is prepared for our inmates'...
- emotional well-being.

We prefer dance class over art therapy.
In 5, 6, 7, 8.
- Cheer up, baby

- Cheer up a bit more

- I can't give my heart that easily

- That's how I will win your heart

- Cheer up baby, Cheer up a bit more

I will go now.
Hold on.
There is one more inmate in this cell.
Inmate 3866.
A few days ago, he caused a scene.

It's the famous Prosecutor Park Jeong Woo, right?
- Yes.

I looked at his chart, but I can't find his medical record at all.
I heard there were few incidents due to his memory loss, but there is no record of them.

It sounds like I purposely prevented him from getting medical treatment.
Did it sound like that?
I just want to meet every single one of them.
You can meet with him after the inmate has calmed down.
I am the doctor here.
Bring him to my office.

- I will report it first.

Yet, you don't seem to be in complete control.
How could you let him stay in this condition?
Well...
Mr. Park Jeong Woo.
Mr. Park Jeong Woo.

We've met a few times through Prosecutor Kang Jun Hyuk.
I want to help you.
- Please leave us alone.

I think he feels uncomfortable.

I can't allow it.

I don't think he's dangerous at all.
I won't report this to Department of Justice.
Let them be.
Mr. Park Jeong Woo.
You said you want to help me.
Let me make a call.
(Attorney Resignation Form)
(Seo Eun Hye)
What is it?
Hello?
Park Jeong Woo?
Are you still my attorney?
Yes, I am.

I have to find someone.
- Who is it?

He stayed in my cell, but he got out.
He knew what happened on the night of the incident.
He knew about Ha Yeon.

His name is Lee Seong Kyu.

It's 901216...
Is that it?
Please find him as soon as possible.
I'll be there as soon as I find him.
Are you really Jeong Woo?
What are you talking about?
Nothing.
Okay.
Your wound will heal in a few days.
Okay.
You're done.
I'll see you next time.
Thank you.
Head of Security, I have a request.
He is psychologically very unstable right now, with his sentence and all.
It is very dangerous for him to be by himself right now.
Will you make a report to the Department of Justice?
It's a request.
Prosecutor Kang.
We need to talk.
Why didn't you tell me before?
If I knew there was a video of his confession, he could've avoided a death penalty.
I told you.
It's a trial you can't win.
So are you satisfied now?
Satisfied?
I lost two of my friends, and Ha Yeon.
Do you think I'm satisfied?
- What I'm saying is...

No, it's not over yet.
There is the final appeal.
Will you make the case?
- I haven't decided.

By that time,
Jeong Woo will accept his sentence.
Do take care of him.
Goodbye.
Why is he trying to be so cool?
May I ask you something?
Her name is Lee Yun Seo, and the guardian is Lee Seong Kyu.
I heard her surgery is near, but I don't know her room number.
(Result for Lee Yun Seo)
- There's no patient with that name.

Oh, right.

She isn't here, either.
He said he had to get out soon because of his sister's surgery.
She has to be in a hospital nearby.
How long will you keep this from Mother?
What can I tell her?
That Min Ho she once knew is dead... or that I'm Min Ho?
Both.
Let's go in.
Mother, we're here.
You two are here.
How are you feeling today?
Oh, I'm good.
Sit down.
Yeon Hee.
Yes, Mother.
You should get married.
Min Ho.
- Yes.

Don't worry and get ready for your marriage.

You two should head to the US.
Yes, Mom.
Yes, Mother.

Yes, Yeon Hee.
Please take care... of my poor son, Min Ho.
You're the only one for him.
Of course, Mother.
Okay.

What is this?

Who took him out?
The new medical officer threatened me... saying that she will report this to the Department of Justice.
What?

Did you say...
- she was a psychiatrist?

This is a prision, not a mental institution.
No one volunteered to come this far.
What if we have an emergency?
She's certified in internal medicine, too.
Really?
Should I put Inmate 3866 back in the punishment cell?
It's too troublesome to have something like this reported.
It's not like President Cha will know that he is out.
- Keep your eyes on him.

It's not like we're in kindergarten.

Fold a star.
That means another star on your criminal record.
Do you want to die?
I'm finished.

Your number ends with 7, so 7 times it is.
East, west, south, north, East, west, south, north.
Can you buy me some roasted chicken?
- Here is your roasted chicken.

My goodness, Miryang.
Not everyone can make this stand.
- Look, it's up.

It's standing on its own.
You didn't do it.
It was me.
Teacher, over here.
Excuse me, Brother.

I've folded some people in half, but I've never folded any papers.
Do you need some help?
Yes.

Okay.
Inmate 3866, join me.
Teacher, this is the plane from my heart to yours.
- It transforms.

I am disabled.
That is so pretty.
You are pretty.
Thank you... for what you just did.
Yeon Hee.
Seon Ho was...
It was an accident.
I couldn't help it.

I won't ever let you down again.
Whatever happens,
I will protect... you and Eun Soo.
I will.
(Kim Seok)
I will be in the car.
Yes.
I found a few places where Lee Seong Kyu dwelled as a kid.
- I will check them out.

Find him no matter what.
Hello, thank you for all of your hard work.
- May I ask you a question?

Her name is Lee Yun Seo, and the guardian is Lee Seong Kyu.
I heard she's in this hospital, but I don't know her room number.
Give me a moment.
- Oh, she's here.

(Room 498, Lee Yun Seo, Deceased)
- However...

Patient Lee Yun Seo already passed away last year.
What?
Did Lee Seong Kyu's sister pass away already?
I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

Is Park Jeong Woo looking for Lee Seong Kyu?
- Let's go.

- Hurry.

- It's so cold.

- You startled me.

Is it Scofield from "Prison Break"?
I guess you watched some American dramas.
I should get out of here.
You have less than a month left.

You have no idea how I feel.

You always come back here the second you are released.
There's no place like prison.
They give you free meals, clothes, and even rooms to live.
I hope you will live happily ever after in here.
It drives me crazy.
Come running.

It's too cold.

Just get here quickly.
- Here it goes.

I asked you to help me move to another cell.
Look.
Do you see that bald guy?
He's no joke, right?
I guess you have nothing to gain from me now.
Aren't you curious?
You put me in jail when I'm innocent, but I let it slide.

Now we are talking.
Prosecutor Park Jeong Woo, you told me something... on that day.
Do you lock up an innocent man?
I didn't give him any money.
Where's the prosecutor?
- Stay quiet.

I need to talk to the prosecutor.

There he comes.

Park Jeong Woo.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.

Hey.
I didn't do it.
I told him to kill the boss in a fit of temper, but I didn't pay him to do that.

I know you didn't.
What did you just say?

There was one more person who died from the accident.
He was the NFS medical examiner.
It was not just a simple hit-and-run accident.
- Then why am I here?

- I needed a suspect.

- You scumbag.

Wait a bit longer.
Once I catch him,
everything will be over.
Three days later, you lost your memory.
You said everything will be over once you catch him.
Who are you talking about?
You.
You didn't tell me about it.

Hey.
How long are you going to go on like this, Park Jeong Woo?
What's going on?

Nothing, Sir.
I was just dusting the snow.
Help me move to another cell.
Who knows?

What is he trying to do?
Did I put him in prison to catch someone?
You said I will be released once you catch him.
Who is he?
Who is he talking about?
Is it Seong Kyu?
No, I've never chased Seong Kyu.
Who is he then?
Who on earth is he?
Father just called me.

He used to have a drink... with Seon Ho once a month.
He never brought it up since the accident, though.
I see.
I've never once had a drink with my father.
Seon Ho must have been happy.
It's been a while... since we had a drink together.
This is the first time since Min Ho's funeral.
After Min Ho died,
I didn't feel like drinking.
He was not a very good son, but the grief of a parent who lost a child has no parallel.
I'm sure it doesn't.
I can't even imagine how you feel.
- Seon Ho.

All I have now for Chamyung Group is you.
I will keep that in mind.
Father.
There's something I want to ask you.
Go ahead.
Why... did you hate Min Ho so much?
I always wondered.
You've never... got angry with me even once.
Why were you so harsh on Min Ho?
Why did you do that?
It was for Min Ho.
- Pardon?

For Min Ho?
I wish he could've heard that... before he died.
I'm sure he knew.
Don't you think?
Min Ho is gone.
Just let it go.
Okay.
Min Ho is gone.
How can I let it go?
I'm right here alive.
Seon Ho.
- Yes.

Do you understand?
President Cha.

You look great in the picture.
Do I?
Your wife must be very happy.
I heard you have dinner with her on your wedding anniversary every year.
- That's right.

Okay.
(President Cha Seon Ho rebuilt Chamyung Group in crisis.)
Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be arriving... at Incheon International Airport shortly.
(Seon Ho)
Seon Ho.

When do you intend on returning my calls?
I just arrived in Seoul.
I'll be at the hotel I always stay at, so call me.
- Hello.

- I'll see you again.

- Excuse me.

- May I ask you something?

Do you know this young man?
He's the young man that lived in the rooftop house.
He lived up there.
His little sister was very sick.
He moved away last year.
- Where to?

Come to think of it, Mr. Kim would probably know.
There he is.

Yes.

I remember he didn't have much belongings.
Do you remember where he moved to?
Yes.

Really?
I thought you weren't coming because you didn't make a reservation.
I prepared the room that you always stay in.
I appreciate it.
Please take my luggage to my room.
I'm sorry.
Which floor are you going to?
The 12th floor.
You arrived early.
- I'll prepare the usual, Sir.

I hope you like it.
You don't have to do this.
Seon Ho's wedding day... is a day I can never forget.
(Onsu Cathedral)
(Onsu Cathedral)
Kids.
- Yes?

Have you seen this man?
- Yes.

- Which way did he go?

All right.

This is... the building Park Jeong Woo lived in.
Yes.

He lived here for a short time.
- When was that?

Yes.

Prosecutor Park's case.
Which apartment did he live in?
Let me see.
(Tenant List)
(Lee Seong Kyu, Apartment 304 of Building 101)
Here it is.
He lived across from Prosecutor Park.
What on earth... happened that night?
(Woljeong Prison)
Wait a minute.
Go ahead.
What?
Warden.

There's no need to worry.
Let's forward to another good year.
(President Cha)
Cheers.
Darn it.
He's not the Seon Ho I know.
There's something going on.
Gentlemen.
Your hot drinks are ready.
Which one's hot chocolate?
- This one.

- Thank you.

What would you like?
Coffee, as usual, of course.
- Here you are.

And this coffee's for me.
Ms. Rockfish.
Where will this coffee take us?
Since it's cold today, let's go to Hawaii.
Take off.
- Are we there?

Do you see me in my bikini?
I can see you.

- I'm taking it off.

- We're in prison.

You both must be going crazy now.
Enough with the nonsense.
Now that Seong Kyu's gone, there's no one to take care of Inmate 3866.
Inmate 3866.

Thank you.
What is that?
It's something Seong Kyu left behind.
I wonder what happened between the two.
Inmate 3866.

I'll be there as soon as I find him.
Lee Seong Kyu.
How could you possibly show up here?
How have you been?
I...
I'm sorry I yelled at you last time.
It's all right.
Can you tell me... what you meant by saying you did it?
How do you know that song?
I just came back to thank you.
Thanks to you, I was only sentenced to a fine.
I know.

So now, can tell me... what you know?
Can you please tell me?
Please.
Please, Seong Kyu.
I just said that.
- What?

Then how did you know the song?
Why can't you answer me?

Seong Kyu.
Seong Kyu.
Seong Kyu, please.
Jeong Woo, I should get going.
- I said I'd be back soon.

I will come again later.
I said I'd be back soon.
Is Ha Yeon here?
I'm right.
Ha Yeon is here, isn't she?
Lee Seong Kyu!

Please let me out.

Ha Yeon is here.
Open it.

Tae Soo, Ha Yeon is here.
Ha Yeon is here, Tae Soo.
Tae Soo, please let me out.

Please, Tae Soo.

Thank you.
(Dreamland Preschool)
Ha Yeon!

Ha Yeon!
Uncle.
Ha Yeon, you are up.
Yes, I am.
Ha Yeon!
(Innocent Defendant)
Ji Soo, no!
Mr. Park Jeong Woo, did you recall something else?
I remember that night.
Seong Kyu's sister he was talking about was Ha Yeon.
- We have a problem.

Mr. Cha Min Ho, I have something to tell you.
I won't let it end like this.

I will start the investigation, Mr. Cha Seon Ho.
Will you try to escape from prison?

- Are you escaping?
