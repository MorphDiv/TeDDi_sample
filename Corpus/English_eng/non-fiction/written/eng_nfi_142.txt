J?
- Baz:

life-changing money.
Camp Pendleton...

There is a ton of cash on that base.
and then I...

we're cool.
I'm here for Craig.

His mother.

Pope:

You call that being a mother? and now she's betraying your family.
Lena:

Who?

where were you going? she wouldn't leave Lena alone in the house.
not ever!
She's gone for good.
I know something happened.

I have something for you.

my mom...

too.
Come on in.
Come on in here.

Grab another beer just over here...
Baz:

get up.

- You good?

Good?
Come on.

let's go.
go!
C-cover it.
Ahh.
huh?
you remember when you and pope duct taped this Roman candles on the side?
Sent it down quarry hill?
I still have a scar on my ass when I bounced out of that.
man.
I went over the cliff in that thing.
I hit the lake like cement.
That's it!
you gotta be shitting me.
You sure no one got made?
Baz:

thanks to j.
baby.
by the way.
You said this thing was solid.
You said it was north of 90 grand.
It was supposed to be.
Then what the hell happened?
Now let's go eat that pie.
We risk our lives for $500.
All she can talk about is pie.
It's not even $500.

We pitched her a million other jobs.
has to be the brewery.
man.
You don't think we deserve more of an explanation?
and you're whining like a bunch of spoiled brats!
What about the jobs that raised you all your life?
every one of you.
not you.
smurf?
I wonder how many cocktails she had when she had the brilliant idea for us to hit a brewery.
Maybe this was your fault.

Huh?
No deliveries by the northeast gate ever?
Who came up with that great idea?
not once was it used.
Smurf:

And what about the safe?

How do you know you have the right safe?
We got the right safe!

I'm so sick of this shit.

She's trying to pit us against each other 'cause she knows that if we stick together...
What?

baby boy.

let's cool it out.

okay? 'cause I have to go pick your kid up at school.
Unless it was something you were planning to do.
Why?
Why are we still letting her run shit?

man.
please.
thanks for being such pussies then.
'cause we didn't make empty threats?
They're not empty threats!

you let us know.
shut up about it.
let's walk.
She doesn't give a shit about any of us.
We know it.

She just uses us to get what she wants.
I think that she's just upset.
j?
What she's really capable of?
no question.
We're all pissed.

But the smart thing to do right now is to take a beat and just cool out.
Cool out.

Fine.

let's talk to her.
Let's tell her why things have to change.
Now she knows how fed up we are.

No.

That's it?

I'll do jobs solo if I have to not to put up with her shit.
pope?

yeah?
Let's do it.
Okay.
man.
maybe I'll meet you over there.
It's 34 grand.
I just need more time...
Time.

that's a new one.
Please.
but I... okay?

You got your coloring in there?
good girl.
I'll be back in a minute.
Child:

Go inside and help mommy.
Go in.
go.
I still get my 10 grand?
You said the brewery paid their illegals with cash.
Teddy?
I was gonna ask you the same.
not Tuesday.
Today's Tuesday.
Janine.
Where you goin'?
Man:

Knee drags as he comes around the curve.
What are you working on?
just physics.
Splittin' atoms and shit?
just some problems on acceleration.
not again.
How many times do I have to say the flu?
Deran:

Baz:

man.
he shows.

honey.
can we go to the park?
not right now.

okay?
Pope all right?
he's all right.

He's just doing up his place.

Think he's out buying a lamp or something.
now a lamp.
it won't look like a prison cell anymore.
we got a bit out of line.
we get it.

Who's to blame shouldn't be the point here.
We gotta talk about changing some things.
Yeah?
Like what?
first...
We want more of a say in what jobs we do.
you brought me Pendleton.
We ran with it.
so... every other idea you had was crap.
but we still had to suck it up.
I think all we're saying is we want to start making family decisions in... in a different way.
we're not kids anymore.

you can't expect us to be...
The boss?
I'm the boss all right.

Not so top down.

Is that what you've been doing while I was out?
Figuring out how to gang up on me?
no.
I have a feeling or worse.
You with your little atm job.

Emptied out my bank account.
And what about you with that hells angels who thought you'd do better without a tongue?
And you I'm really proud of.
Calling your mommy to come save you from a meat locker covered in your own piss.
we get it.
you don't get it! begging for my forgiveness!
It's out of respect we're being honest with you here.
Why should you keep picking all the jobs when we take all the risk?
you decide the split? my god.
It took me three months to get that lice out of your hair!
and not a day goes by you don't throw that in my face!
How long exactly do I have to keep kissing your ass for?
You tell me.

here's the thing.
Who do you think's kept this from happening the last two years?
Pope's not even here 'cause he can't stand the sight of you.
And who's defended you like an idiot?
Who's tried to convince your own sons... your own sons...
That you're not the cold-hearted bitch you seem to be?
smurf.
Me!
It's a goddamn waste of time.
I'm out.
yep.
too.

Let's see how long you all last.
Knowing that look on her face man.
I'm gonna remember it the rest of my life.
man.

No more sucking' mommy's dick!
Equal partners at last.
You really think baz and pope are gonna let that happen?
man.

Not if we call bullshit.
man.
And the only way that's gonna change is if we start doing start coming up with our own ideas. like this yacht thing I've been thinking about.
you know?
man.

You know what else we need to do?
What?

not baz.
the kid's got balls.
He's gotta be confused as shit right now.
It's the perfect time to get in his head.
how do we do that?
we can try being nice to the kid.
Ungrateful?

Was that before or after you called her a bitch?
Before.
I told you it was pointless.
it didn't help you didn't show up.
it would've gone much worse if I did.
it's hard to imagine.
Pope:

please.
yeah?

So it's now?

Craig and deran aren't gonna fold?
They're not gonna fold.
We just gotta get a job together quick.
I was thinking new canticle.

Yeah.

It's a ready job.

We have to re-scout it.

What about the kid?

We use him if we need him if he's willing to piss off grandma.
So far he's just kept his mouth shut.
Can you blame him?

either.
We gotta throw smurf a cut.
but something.

She's got her building.

I wouldn't give a shit if she did starve.
it's just smart.
Feel like you owe her something?

I'm not paying her.
I wish she'd have dropped me and Julia off at a firehouse door the day she had us.
What's going on with you guys?
Nothin'.

I just finally see her for what she is.
man.

The kid broke up with her.

Just gotta keep her in check.
Sex can't be that good.
is she waving her pompoms at you in bed?
What's going on?

No.

not pumping gas?
I can't be fronting you like this all the time.
did you forget to pay a bill or something?
- I don't know.

Not anymore.
She just canceled this shit.
that was fast.
soon.
I need the cash.

I do now.
You want another one?

please?

Have another one.
Don't you have to get Lena?
It's not even late.
Smurf could use a distraction after what happened.
too?
- Mm-hmm.

And what did she say when you told her about cath?
I didn't tell her about cath.
She'd be up here with the u-haul in two minutes.
Are you kidding me?
It's not happening.
no?
- Oh.

no.
I'm all out of antibiotics.
I'll see you tomorrow.

Excuse me.

Come on.
Here.

okay?
Damn.
Manny said you'd still look good.
You recognize me?
I'm all grown.
Javi?
I left you 10 messages.
I figured they were from Manny. so I'm here to take you.
To the desert?
Yeah.
Let me go put this away.
I'll give you a beer.
Some big boys to feed.
Manny's not gettin' another cent from me.
just like we agreed.
He should know that by now.
He's dying.
He'd be pissed I said it like that.
There it is.
I'm parked down the street.
Come on.
no.
You don't hop my fence and tell me to get in a car.
He's running out of time.
You get it? you're gonna come say goodbye.
On my own terms.
Yeah.
You're getting in the car.
I'm not.
Whose kid is that?
Baz's.
You gonna sing her to sleep?
How you used to sing to me?
And you won't need that gun.
This is your idea of ideas?
We can rob it for what?

man.
left his wife holding the bag.
So?
So that's why I need cash.
I'm gonna buy this place.
Take over the lease and run it.
Come on.

You can't even see the "open" sign.
baby.
Can I still live here?
baby.
they...

and I think... okay?
that's fine.
But you can't be a spy if you want them to trust you.
you can't have them think you're one.
I'm going to bed.
Good night.
babe.
I got you a credit card. so there's no limit.
I trust you'll be responsible.
smurf.
Get a good night's sleep.
Hey.
Shit.

sorry.

I'm hungry.

I don't want any food.
Just some privacy.
Yo!
Banging on the door.
I just had an epic fight with my dad.
nuclear - my mom screaming at me wait.

Guam.

What?

yeah.
sleeping.
That "0-6" position in Guam running the base's sewage treatment plant?
and he expects us all to move.
Why would you go with your dad to run a shit factory in Guam?
I told him I'm not going.
tell your dad to eat a bag of dicks and that Guam can kiss your ass.
Do you have any Tequila or coke?
I'll take any altered state I can get right now.
no.

Oh.

but did your fever break?
but the doctor said I'm contagious.
I don't care.

Seriously.
I don't want to get you sick.
Okay.

Uh-huh.

Who was that?

You want soup?
Your turn.
sweetie.
I told you your daddy would come back...

Thanks for watching her.
No worries.
Should've texted you.

It would've been nice.
Oh!
you win.
Go pick up your things.
Daddy and I will be out in a minute.
smurf.
I'm not gonna be able to walk it back.
I don't remember asking you to.
I talked to pope.

Wow. 10.
I haven't needed taken care of since I was 11 years old.
we're gonna do it anyway.
'Cause you always took care of me.
You bet I did.
where's tigey?
Tigey?

Let's go see.
man.

Get in the car.
plan some stuff out.
I've got school.
man.
I think your gpa will survive a day.
don't you wanna be a part of this?
Me and Craig think you should be.
come on.

I never went to school.
man.
The fancy wedding on a yacht?
we hit it while it's cruising out in the ocean. and then we get away clean.

Not to mention get away in the middle of the ocean.
or we can hit new canticle like we should've done two years ago.
Unless one camera and a fat guy is too much security for you.
sorry.

nothin'.

yeah?

New canticle.

People from around here go there.
remember?
About ripping off a church?
What kind of shit Karma's that's gonna be?
man.
Daddy.
do you like it?

And then we can go to the beach?
okay?
I say we vote.
Mega church or the yacht.
J can be the swing.
What?

Isn't that the new deal?

J's not gonna be the tiebreaker.

so what?

Is that how it's gonna go?

Is... is that not gonna be equal anymore?
yes.

- And who decides when that is?

What are you complaining about?

how many times do I have to tell you?
No beach today.

I'll...

if it's okay with your dad.
it's fine.

Let's pick this up later.
You draw this?

hang back a minute.
okay?
Did smurf tell you to come here?
No.
She didn't send you?
You know that fire you set yesterday?
The boys think that was pretty smart.
You know what I think?
I think bringing cops to the scene could've really screwed us.
I think being lookout means you keep looking out.
I just want you to do it.
- Okay?

man.
an hour?
Yeah.

Yeah.
He's... he's...

could you watch him for a sec?
I just have to change the baby.

I'm just right over there.
Sure.

Thanks.
right?
Hey.
Hola.

- Good.

- Thanks for coming up.

I was on my way home from solvang.
What the hell is in solvang?
that.
- Okay.

huh?
Why?
no hotel.

- Yeah.

It's not gonna happen.
- You don't know that.

We're done.

What?
we're done.

You're not exactly open about what's going on with you either.
- It's not the same.

- How's it...

Okay.

S-so what now? and you can see where I live?

Am I just supposed to just jump at the chance?
Why not?
Is cath's stuff still at your house?
yeah.

and then I'll think about it.
bro.

Are you kidding me?

- I was going to!

- Yeah!

It's not a good look.
And you wonder why they treat us like kids!
It's 'cause you give 'em a reason to.
man!

Responsibility!
Okay!
- It's smurf.

She's making meat loaf.

better make sure she takes the first bite.
I did it.
I told my dad to eat shit.

man.
I sort of had to.

Right.
kiddo.
Uncle pope bought me ice cream.
That's nice.

Thanks.
We really gonna do this?
Yep.
She says one goddamn thing about anything... huh?
You trying to rub salt on my wounds?
That it?
I think we all had a pretty tough day yesterday.
and that's never gonna change.
Not ever.
cut it out.
Let's do it.
May we all get what we want...
All:

So come on.
what have you agreed on?
What's your next plan?
baby.

I'm right here.

He started screaming again.
I upped the morphine on his drip.
Hey.
Lena.
Lena.

Come on.

uncle pope.
Good night.
I'll get the rest of the dishes.
baby.
