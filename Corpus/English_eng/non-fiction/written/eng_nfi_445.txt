Laura?
Laura?
Chloe?
- Are you sure about out here?

It's a big, free country.
Laura?
Kill me now.
Rest in peace.
You weren't supposed to be home until later.
Well, it's a good thing I got out early.
I can only imagine what would've happened if I had gotten home any later.
- Nothing that already hasn't.

- Mrs. Wilcox...

You left... you left your headlights on.
Go home, Nicholas.
Uh, yeah.
Are you happy?
You've embarrassed me for life again.
Do you have any idea how worried I was?
Still in one piece.
You were supposed to be in this house watching your sister.
Ever since you started dating him...
- Don't, don't!

And don't think that they didn't call me from the school to tell me that you skipped classes again today.
- I had cramps.

I don't want you seeing him anymore.
- What?

Mom, it's my birthday.
You already said I could go out with Bre.
- Is Laura in trouble?

Yes.

Laura.
Laura?
♪ It seems like only yester... ♪
Hey, babe.

Are you there yet?
Well, don't wait too long.
What do you think?

Okay.

- Hey.

- Ready?

Okay.
♪ Oh summer blue
♪ I've been waiting for you
♪ Like a big old ocean
♪ I can dive into
Ooh, hello, gorgeous.
Oh, my God.
I haven't seen him before.
He must be a tourist.
I don't think tourists paint boats.
You should go, talk to him.
- No.

I don't know.

Bre, he's not that old.
I'm gonna do it for you.
- No, Laura.

Laura!
Laura.
♪ I've been waiting for you
Say hi.
- Hello.

I'm Bre.

- She thinks you're hot.

Okay.
Well, me and my invisible friend over there are gonna go now so I can die.

You love me.
- Ah!

Parker, God damn it.
Have you been in the sun all day, Bre?
Um, no.

You must always look this hot then.
You did not just say that.
It wasn't great.

Where's Nick?
- I thought he was with you.

Find Nick.
That'll never not be weird.
What the hell?
Surprise!
- Happy birthday, babe.

Is this where you were all morning?
Guilty.

Whose boat is this?
Don't worry about it.
Thank you, guys.
- You're welcome.

Happy birthday.
Hey, you look beautiful today.
- Aww.

- Are you guys coming?

You two have fun.
- Bye.

Mm-mm.

Hey, Chloe.

- Laura's not here.

I saw her leave this morning.
Where'd she go?
Ah.
- Are you okay?

It's just a cut.
Hey, nice.
Who's it supposed to be?
- Hey...

Come on.

Ahh!
Bre, I know she's with him.
Give me his phone number.
Then put your mother on the phone.
That's what I thought.
Okay.

I'm really gonna miss you next year.
Laura, don't bring it up.
But it's gonna happen either way.
You're going across the country, and I'm not.
- We can make it work.

I'm not delusional.

It's not meant to last forever, and I'm okay with that.
- Are you breaking up with me?

I'm just trying to think realistically.
- You gonna ignore it?

Let me go get it.
- Who is it?

Are you gonna pick it up?
No.
Laura?
Why don't you call Dad.
Maybe he's heard from her.
I don't want to bother your father.
He's probably busy with Jenny.
- Jessie.

You know, she's gonna call the Coast Guard if you're not back soon.
Yeah.

I thought being as far away from home as possible was just where you wanted to be.
Ah, hey, no need to kick me.
What?
What's wrong?

Nick, you're such a jerk sometimes.
Don't joke about that.
It's probably just a big fish.
Wait, you're serious?
Oh, my God.

Even if it was a shark, they basically never bite people unless they think you're a seal or something.
I see it!

Hey, calm down, okay?
We need to get back to the boat.
Stop, stop.
Let's get back to the boat.
I see it.
Where'd it go?
- Ah!

It bit me.
It just grazed you.
We'll get back to the boat.
Can you swim?
Yeah.
Nick!
- Nick!

Nick!
Turn around!
Nick!
Nick!
No!
Grab my hand.
I got you.
It's okay.

Laura!
Laura!
Laura!

By the time I got there, he was already gone.
It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you to the hospital.
It'll be just fine.
Thank you.
Come on.

Uh, yeah, sure.

Let me take this off.
This is Casey Jean Hempel reporting.
I'm here with Bruce Kane, son of Representative Richard Kane.
Tell us, Bruce, how did you come across the girl?
Uh, I mean, I just...

She's alive today because of you.
How does it feel to be a hero?
A hero?
Oh, hey.

Mommy was.

Sorry about Nick.
Did Mom tell you?
It's on every channel.
- Sailor-boy.

No.

There he is, the man of the hour.
Hey, you're up.
- Do you work here?

Well, uh, not technically.
Bruce volunteers down at the pediatric cancer center.
- Really?

I just play videogames with the kids sometimes.
I've never seen you around, so I kind of thought you were from out of town.
Well, I grew up here.
I just got back in town a few weeks ago.
Sweetie, Bruce's dad is Richard Kane, one of our state representatives.
Sorry.

I, uh, wanted to bring you this.
Where'd you get it?
They towed the boat in last night.
Bruce Kane, son of State Rep Richard Kane, became a household name overnight after his heroic rescue of a local high school senior.
Well, it feels great to know
I was able to save someone's life.
Truly, my only regret is that I couldn't get there sooner.
Maybe then, we'd be celebrating two saved lives.
Oh, I missed you.
He's a hero.
That's really the only word I can use to describe him.
Bruce has been on the water for as long as we can remember.
We insisted on boating lessons from a young age, and we couldn't be happier.
That girl... well, she's alive today because of it.
I heard her yelling, and I saw the blood in the water.
It was traumatizing.
But I knew I had to save her.
18-year-old Nicholas Jordan was celebrating his girlfriend's birthday when his life was cut tragically short.
While local beaches will stay open, officials have issued a shark warning for the county.
Stay tuned as we bring you an exclusive look into the man that is Bruce Kane.
Don't we have something else to talk about?
I don't know, Laura.

How's Parker?
I've been trying to text him all day.
Oh, you know, he's good.
He's great.

- You suck at lying.

Look, he... he would kill me if I told you, but, um, when he heard, he kind of broke down.
Like, he full-on ugly-cried-broke down.
Hey, there.
Hi, Bruce.
I, uh, figured you were sick of the hospital food, so I wrestled a little something away from the kids.
That's really sweet.

- You look really good today.

- It's Bre, right?

I'm so sorry.
I-I just feel like I should be asking for your autograph or something.
No.

At least it's a good face.
Yep.

Sorry.
Hey, your mom said you're going home today.
Yeah.

Well, that's great.
Well, my break's almost over, so I should get going.
Hopefully, I'll see you around.
Yeah.
Bre.
- What?

No.

- Whatever you say.

Let me help you out.

- I got it.

No, I can get up, Mom.
Well, I don't want you to bust a stitch.
- Come on.

What did you do with Nick's picture?
I just moved it temporarily.

I know you didn't like him, but this is a new low.
Laura, it's nothing against him personally.
- I wanted you to...

I will never forget what happened, and I never want to forget him.
Your daughter almost died.
Why can't you comprehend that?
I don't want to hear your excuses anymore.
No.

You should be the one telling her in person.
You know what?
Just forget about it.
How's Dad?
I'm sorry.
No.

Screw him, right?
One second.
Laura, someone's here to see you.
Okay.

- Look who's here.

- Hi.

Okay, considering.
Um, can I get you something?

Yeah.

Of course not.

Okay.

- So this is your room.

It's exactly how I imagined it would be.
Okay.
You look so happy.
Maybe one day, I could see that smile.
Could you just...

Oh, I...

Here, I-I brought you something.
Consider it a belated birthday present.
Bruce, you really didn't have to do that.
No.

I wanted to.

- Oh.

It's perfect.
Thank you.
So, uh, well, what are you doing this weekend?
Probably just hanging around here.
Well, my parents...
They're having this campaign fundraiser thing at the marina.
You should come as my date.
I don't know, Bruce.

It's just I'm...

Oh, no, no.
I didn't mean, like, a date-date.
Just...

I've made since being back.
I don't even know if I have anything to wear to something like that.
Oh, no.

I'll take care of everything.
Please, I mean, you'd really be doing me a favor this time.
- Sure.

Yeah.

Laura, could you come down here?
What is it?
Uh, I don't know.

Oh, it's gorgeous.
I tell you.
- Go on.

Are you sure you don't want to just go tonight?
No.

You're gonna be late.
May I tell you something, you know, as a friend?
Yeah.
You look stunning in that dress.
You've got killer taste.
- Oh, no.

- Just smile and nod.

Hey.

We were just bragging about our son, the hero.
And is this the young lady herself?

- Yeah.

That dress, it's gorgeous on you.
Thank you.

Well, we're glad you could make it tonight.
Bruce told us about the ordeal that you went through.
My God, what a brave girl.
Bruce was really the brave one.
Well, he's turning into a good man.
- It's nice he's dating again.

- You must be very special.

It's just been such a long time since Bruce has introduced us to any of his girlfriends.
Oh, me and...
Mom, do you... do you want another drink?
- Sure.

- Bruce, what was that?

I thought I made it very clear...
No.

- Okay.

It's just my parents... they worry I keep to myself too much, and when I told them I was bringing you, they just assumed we were together, and I didn't have the heart to tell them otherwise.
- But you know how parents are.

Please, Laura, just for tonight.
- Okay.

I'll be right back.
- Parker.

- Hey.

No.

Hey, thanks for not responding to my text, jerk.
Okay.

Look, I wanted to visit you in the hospital.

Yeah.

Bre told me you weren't doing so hot.
Yeah.

- Yeah.

Look, everyone's been missing you.
It's been kind of depressing, actually.
- Yeah.

- Laura, darling...

This is the photographer from "The Register,"
and he'd like to take Bruce's picture with his new girlfriend as a follow-up.
- Perfect, perfect.

Together.

Laura, I thought that was you.
Mr. Alves, how are you?
"How are you," is the question.
I'm good.

Good to know.

Laura, everything all right?
- Bruce, this is Mr. Alves.

The whole town knows who you are, Mr. Kane.
Not a day goes by we don't read about you in the paper.
Well, I wish they'd stop.

What a modest, young man.
Bruce, Mr. Alves is my English teacher.
Oh, really?
I got certified to sub at the school, it's just there've been no openings.
Well, the year's coming to a close, and most of us have already used all our sick days.
I figured.
Well, hopefully, something comes up.
- It's a shark.

- Laura, Laura...

It's a shark.

Wait.

I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
It's...

- I'm just gonna go home, okay?

Look, just...

I can't, Bruce.

Hey, it was my fault.

I should've known that being by the ocean was a bad idea.
You know what?

- But it's your parents' party.

Dick and Lily, they're in full campaign mode right now.
They won't even notice.
Come on.
You know, my mom's totally got the hots for you.
- Yeah?

She thinks you're so dreamy.
Well, you can tell her I'm flattered.
You should be.
She's really picky about men.
Not for herself, just the guys that I date.
She hated Nick.

And why's that?
I think it's because he reminded her a lot of my dad.
So textbook, right?
Nick was a good guy, though.
Way better than my dad ever was.
Come here.
Do you think about him a lot?
All the time... obviously.
You know, your first love never really goes away.
I mean, I think about mine every day.
Why aren't you together?
It's complicated.
I still see her sometimes.
She's always there when I need someone to talk to.
Sounds nice.
You're really lucky.
I love this song.
May I have this dance?
- We're in your back yard.

What?

All right, sailor-boy.
Let's see what you got.
This is weird.
- Laura?

- Let's go swimming.

Yeah.
I'll go, change, and my mom has extra swimsuits for guests.
Um, me and water aren't really on speaking terms right now.
It's just a pool, and I'll be there with you the whole time.
Now, come on, Ali.

Who's Ali?
I'm so sorry.

- Is that your ex-girlfriend?

- Yeah.

That's all right.

Well, about that swim, Laura?
Yeah.
Coming in?
- Hi.

No.

I mean, you know you can call me any time of the day.
Yeah.

I miss you every day.
Hey, stop that.

- You doing okay?

I just got to get back into it.
Have you talked to Parker?
Yeah.

He must be pretty pissed.
That's an understatement.
How was last night?
It was fine.
Just fine?
I mean, I went there, and I embarrassed myself in front of the whole town, then I left.

- Okay.

- Hey, Bre.

What are you girls up to?
Just talking about frivolous, girly matters.
I was actually just grilling your daughter on every little detail from last night.
She must've had a good time, since she kept her mother up half the night worrying about where she was.
I already said I'm sorry about that.
We just...

Yes.

Bruce, took very good care of you.
Oh, hey, listen.
I've got to work late tonight.
Don't let Chloe stay up.
- I won't.

Bye.
You totally hooked up with him.
Sorry.
I don't know.

I mean, we went back to his place.
We started drinking, and please, don't tell anyone.
Okay.

Uh, I don't know.

Okay.

Yeah.

He's still hung up on his ex.
That shark is still out there.
The shark is still out there.
That shark is still out there.
The shark is still out there.
At the end of the day, that shark is still out there.
And I just can't in my right mind let it take another innocent life.
Hey, what are you doing?
I thought you wanted to go to the beach.
I'm gonna hunt it down, find it, and kill it...
- Your boyfriend's on TV again.

- Hello.

You're starting to get a little red.
- Hi.

Here.
- What are these for?

How'd you know that I was here?
What?
No "thank-you"?
Thank you.

And did you happen to catch the news this afternoon?
Sorry.
Well, is everything okay?
Yeah, um, that just used to be Nick's RINGTONE.
Listen, we need to talk.
That phrase is never the start of a good conversation.
What happened last night, it shouldn't have happened.
I just need some time and some space.
Yeah, for sure.
You take all the time you need.
No pressure.
- Really?

- Cool.

Well, what'd you think I'd say?
I don't know.

No.

Don't worry.
I don't want it to end, but it's for the best.
We have to move on.
But you're my everything.
I can't live without you.
Hey, babe.

I miss you.
Call me back, okay?

Hey, Laura.
- Hey.

- You good?

- Why?

Are people staring?

Relax, okay?

It's like any normal school day.
No one is going to stare.
Well... maybe a few people are staring.
Parker.
Parker, what's going on?
Why is everyone acting like I murdered a puppy?
Did you not read the paper this morning?
No, because we're not 70.
Well, that's a little distasteful.
What?

There's nothing going on between me and Bruce.

- Really?

Oh, sorry.
Laura, hey.
What are you doing here, Bruce?
It's Mr. Kane here.
I'm subbing for Mr. Alves.
Didn't I say I needed some space?
Laura, I applied to work here long before I met you.
Isn't this gonna be kind of awkward though?
I didn't pick your class.
It's what was open, and I couldn't pass on this opportunity.
We can both be mature about this.
Yeah.

Oh, I'm glad to see you're wearing it.
You have no idea how happy it makes me to see it on you again.
Good morning, class.
I'm Mr. Kane.
If you could get your books out, we can get started.
Where's Mr. Alves?
Mr. Alves had a bad fall last night.
Now, he'll probably be out for a while.
All right.

Anybody?
Ah, yes, Parker?
Yeah.

Well, I mean, I think there's a little bit more to it than that.
Do you care to elaborate?
Why don't you ask Laura?

One more word and I'll kick your balls
- straight into your throat.

Did you hear what she said?

I did hear that.

Hardly a threat, considering you'd actually have to have a pair for her to kick.
- You can't say that to me.

Now, go to the office.
All right.

Attention, students.

Somebody in there?
It's weird that he showed up like that my first day back.
- Right?

That's why he volunteered for pediatrics.
Yeah.

There are no sides.
I just think you're blowing this thing out of proportion.
Okay.
But it just made me feel really uncomfortable.
I don't know what you're talking about.
He's a really nice guy.
- Hey.

I thought that was you guys.
Laura was just telling me about your teaching job.
- Congratulations.

- That's great.

- Laura...

Oh, you took the necklace off.
I just didn't want to lose it.
- Bruce?

- Hi.

- It's been so long.

Well, Liz Vaughn,
- this is Sandy Wilcox...

- How do you do?

Laura, of course.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
The whole family was so proud seeing you all over the news.
Well, how are they doing?
- Are they good?

Mom and Dad ask about you.
You should come, say hi sometime.
Yeah.

How do you guys know each other?
Bruce used to date my sister, Alison.
Well, I should get going.

It was... it was so good to see you.
Oh, yeah.
And give my best to the family.

- All right.

- It was nice meeting you.

- What?

Ugh, Laura.
The hero of Hunter's Cove, who recently helped rescue a young girl from the jaws of a bloodthirsty shark is going out to search for the massive predator.
Bruce Kane is setting sail today, determined to track down that very shark that took Nicholas Jordan's life.
Stay tuned for more on this continuing story.
We have to move on.
But you're my everything.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Nurse's office.
What happened?
Nothing.
All right.

Pop quiz on last night's reading.
Everything okay?
Yeah.

What happened to him?
Katherine told me he got attacked in the locker room after detention.
Hey, Bruce?
Mr. Kane?
Oh, yes, Parker.
What can I do for you?
Do you know what time it is?
Yeah.

Anything else?
Nice watch.
Parker.
You're a smart kid, and a smart kid would know that maybe next time, he won't be lucky enough to walk away with just a few bruises.
You have a good rest of your day, okay, bud?
- What the hell?

Knock it off, Ashley.
Like you've never hooked up with a guy you shouldn't...
- Oh, my God.

- We thought it was a joke.

I'm... wait, Laura.
- Parker...

I'm not the one that put the graffiti on your locker.
- I know.

I got the message loud and clear.
I won't mess with you.
You think Bruce did this to you?
Laura, please, it just slipped out.
Yeah, I know, but how could you say something so stupid?
Wow.

What are you doing here?
Laura, hey.

Chloe, don't you have homework?
Just one more game.
- Chloe.

Hey, you heard your sister.
We can play next time I come over, okay?
Okay.
- Next time?

I gave up my shifts at the hospital a couple of days a week so you wouldn't have to watch her all the time.
Was that my mom's idea or was that yours?
Your mom's, and she gave me a spare key.
So I can get in whenever I need to.
Is... is everything okay with Bre?
You seem pretty upset.
I mean, it's just a stupid fight.
Look, it's... it's been a really hard day, and I-I want to be alone.
Oh, yeah.

Feel better, okay?
She's not worth getting mad about.
What are you doing?
Asshole.
Hey, Bre.

I don't like being mad at you.
So call me when you get a chance.
Laura just walked in the door.
I got to call you back.
Hi, Mom.

Bre was admitted to the hospital this morning.
She got hit by a car while jogging.
- Is she okay?

- Do they know who did it?

- That's it.

Where are you going?
Laura...
- Did you witness the accident?

But last night, I told him I was mad at her, and today, she's in a hospital bed.
Look, I have to be honest with you.
You're not giving me much to go by.
So you're not gonna do anything?
Laura, hey.
- Did you follow me here?

I'm meeting my parents down the street for dinner.
And what are you doing at the police station?
I-I went in to see if they had any information about what happened to Bre.
Well, why would you care?
I mean, aren't you really mad at her?
That's what you said yesterday.
Yeah.

But she's still my best friend.
Best friends don't fight, Laura, and you shouldn't be so back-and-forth on who you keep close to you.
I'm gonna go.
Laura... what are you doing tomorrow night?
We should go out.
Alison told me not to ask you.

Wait.

Yeah.
All the time.
She's great with advice.
So what do you say?
Tomorrow is my mom's late night at the hospital.
So I'm on Chloe duty.
- Well, maybe I could stop by.

Because, um, I still have a lot of homework to catch up on.
Yeah.

- Mom, I need to talk to you.

Do you want to begin with where you were today?
I know you weren't in school.
- Who told you that?

- Of course.

Laura, what is going on with you?
Mom, Bruce was in the house last night.
Laura...
You think I'm lying?

You're gonna trust a stranger over your own daughter?
Look, I am trying to give you the benefit of the doubt, but you're skipping school again.
You're unreliable with your sister, and now you're blaming some poor guy for running your friend off the road?
Does this have to do with your father?
No.

I'm...

Mom.
- Mom.

And my day is complete.
You can't run away from me now.
Watch me.
Parker.
Parker!
- What the hell, Laura?

I believe you about Bruce.
I think he's the one that hit Bre too.
Yeah.

I don't want anything to do with this.
I tried, and they won't do anything.
I'm scared, Parker.
He's following me everywhere, and you're the only person that I can trust.
Look, I don't know what to tell you.
Look, I know you're pissed at me.
But I swear, I've never had any feelings for Bruce.
I still think about Nick every day.
You have no idea how much I cared about him.
What are we supposed to do, Laura?

I'm gonna talk to his ex-girlfriend, Alison.
I looked up the family, and I found her sister on Facebook.
They live in Stone Bridge.
Maybe she can help talk some sense into him.
All right.

I'll pick you up in the morning.
Thank you.
Hi.

Oh, yeah.

Thank you.
Um, this is Parker.
- Hi.

Take a seat.
What brings you guys here?
Is everything okay with Bruce?
Not in the least.
What's wrong?
I'm just feeling a little worried.
I was hoping to talk to Alison.
She's... not here.
Um, how much has Bruce told you about Alison?
Not much.

- He said that?

Have you actually heard him talking to her?
Yeah.

I-I think I should just call Bruce and get the...
- No.

He doesn't know that we're here, and, um, we...
We really want to help him.
Okay.

Did Bruce ever get violent with Alison?
No, no.
Bruce worshipped Alison.
He was a little intense, maybe, but no.
Alison really loved him.
Is that her?
Yeah.

Hey, she...

I guess Bruce has a type.
When is she coming back?
Okay.

I don't know what Bruce has been telling you, but Alison died almost four years ago.
- Shut up.

No.

It was in a car accident.
Bruce took it really hard, actually.
He always blamed himself.
- We should go.

But is there anything I can do to help?
I mean, if Bruce is in trouble...
No.

Bye...
I guess.
I can't believe you're doing this to me tonight.
Of all nights, you picked tonight.
It's just... it's not gonna work when we graduate.
I don't want to end it, but it's for the best.
We need to move on.
But you're my everything.
Bruce?

Bruce, slow down.
I can't live without you.
Bruce, slow down.
Bruce, slow down!
Hey, babe.

Call me back, okay?

Find Laura.
Bruce, hi.

Well, Laura said you were working tonight.
Nope.

- Lucky me.

Lucky you.

I've been...

No.

Honestly, I have no idea where she went tonight.
Yeah.

Bruce, are you feeling all right?
No.

Does it look like...
Maybe you should go home.

Well, would you be a doll and just tell her I stopped by?

- Sure.

Thank you, Sandy.
What the hell?
Bruce... ow.
Bruce, stop.
Did you think you could just sleep with another guy, and I wouldn't care?
What the hell are you talking about?
I saw you with Parker.
I can't believe you would cheat on me like that.
Parker's just my friend.
But even if he was more, it's none of your business.
We're not dating, Bruce.
My personal life is none of your business.
I should've listened to Alison.
She told me you were trouble.
Alison's dead, Bruce.
Shut up.

Shut up!

You don't know anything about her.
You take for granted everything I've given you.
I saved you.
I'm in charge of your life now.
Do you understand?

Come on.
Come here.
I'm taking you out to dinner tomorrow night, and we're gonna have a good time.
Yeah?

Yeah?
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

- Hey.

What are you doing tomorrow?
- I need your help.

Ready to go?
Okay.

Bruce, how's it going out there?
Any signs?
Still no luck finding it, but I'm not gonna give up.
I know he's out there.
Okay.

It's gonna run on the morning show.
Your segments have been getting some really good ratings.
Would you mind if I do it again?
You know, I feel like...

Sure.

God, you're beautiful, Ali.
Thank you.
Did I tell you I'm still looking for the shark?
No sign of it yet, but I'm not gonna give up.
You really don't have to do that.
I'm sure it's long gone by now.
I'll find it.

I have to give them that headline and prove to them that I'm more than just Richard Kane's son.
I've always thought you were more than that.
I know you did.
From the moment you looked at me when I pulled you out of the water,
I knew it.
I thought about what you said about Bre.
How best friends don't fight.
- Really?

You were absolutely right.
I can't have people like that in my life.
I'm glad you're realizing that.
I just wanted to say thank you for what you did to her.
I know you're just trying to protect me.
Hey... you're welcome.
If anyone else tries treating you badly,
I'll take care of them.
Parker, what do you think you're doing?
Back to work.
- Laura, what's going on?

Yeah.
Were you recording me?
Stay away from me and my friends, and stay the hell out of my house.
Send me the video.
I'll pick you up when I'm out.
I bet the cops listen to her now, Mr. Kane.
I have to go.

I'm not leaving forever, just for tonight.
Chloe?
Chloe, Chloe!
Chloe...
Why are you yelling?
I'm so sorry.
Okay, Let's get you to bed.
Hey.
Parker, come inside.
Parker.
Parker?
Yo.
Parker?
What are you...

Ahh!
♪ You made me
♪ Love you
♪ I do
♪ I want to do it
♪ You made me
♪ Want you
♪ And all the time you knew it ♪
♪ I guess you always knew it ♪
♪ You made me happy
Surprise.
You need to leave, Bruce.
I've come to forgive you, Ali.
I don't care what happened with Parker.
We can move on from this.
Just don't come any further.
Oh, baby,
I'm giving you another chance.
Just put the knife down.
Okay?
I know you'd never hurt me.
Ahh!
♪ That's true yes I do
♪ Indeed I do
Get out!
What are you doing?
♪ Would I cry
Laura, it doesn't end here.
♪ I want some love
Not gonna need this out here.
Nobody's gonna find us.
What are you doing?
You don't appreciate what I've done for you.
I saved your life.
Bruce, I appreciate that so much.
Well, you don't show it!
I'm so sorry about Alison, Bruce.
But I'm not her.
I know you're not her, Laura.
Alison would never take life for granted the way you do.
There it is.
Hey, I told you it was still here.
Too bad we can't give them this headline.
A girl killed by the same shark that she was saved from.
The media would eat that up.
Well, that wasn't very lady-like.
Don't come any closer.
Ahh!
Ahh!
I see you've met Alison.
I knew you wouldn't leave me, baby.
Of course not, Ali.
You're my everything.
I can't live without you.
Laura, I...
You can't hide on a boat, Laura!
No, no, no.

That's all I have left of her.
Laura, hi.
Oh, Laura... oh, sweetie, I am so sorry.
I-I should've listened to you about Bruce.
I should've trusted you.
I'm sorry about what I said about Dad.
I'm just so...

I know.

I love you.
