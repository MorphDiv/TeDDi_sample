- Previously on "The Mist"...

The Black Spring.
It's like our version of Santa, but instead of not getting gifts, if you don't behave, you'll be torn apart alive.
My family's at the mall.

What if it doesn't have any keys?
- I'll bet Mia knows how to hot-wire.

What if we put the bodies outside, use them as bait...
- What the hell?

Hey, stop it!
- Guys, guys.

I think we need to establish a set of rules.
Whoever endangers the group is thrown out of the mall.
It's okay to be scared about what happened.
Should I be scared about the people who hung themselves or that big cloud of whatever-it-is outside, or do you mean that I'm stuck in this mall with the guy who raped me?

Your daughter gets drunk and screws around, and it's my boy's fault?
But then again, that makes perfect sense, knowing your wife.
Jesus!
We gotta go!
Over there.
Driver's seat.
Will this help?
Shit.
Hey!
Connor dropped it.
Next time somebody drops a gun, you give it to me.
You didn't see what happened to Mikhail.
What happened to Mikhail?
A giant moth killed him!
A giant moth?
Can we get going?

I just need this one and then this one, and then, there.
What the...

I thought you said you knew how to do this.
I can!

What do you mean, something's wrong?

I've done this a thousand times!
Even if the battery's dead, we should hear the ignition trying to catch.
Listen.
Come on.

Come...
We need to find a working car.
Uh... all right, all right.
There's a gas station right around the corner from here.
We can't go back out there.
Well, how long do you think we've got before something happens?
It seems like the mist comes and go, right?
It's thicker when we're out there, and then it kind of disappears when we're not.
Yeah, it was super thick when Mikhail, you know...
Okay, okay.
So we wait for it to withdraw a little bit, and then we make a run for it.

- Okay.

The mist is starting to thin out.
Okay.
- Just follow me, all right?

- You stay close to me.

Okay. 1, 2... 3.
No!

- What's going on?

Sue!
- Calm down now.

- I can't breathe.

I can't breathe.
Come on.
Come on.

Another panic attack?
Well, there's nothing to do but sit around being scared.
That's why we gotta distract 'em.
Let's see what we got here.
- All right.

Who's up for poker?
Yeah, sure.
Here.

What?

Go long.
Yeah.
Look, babe, nothing was gonna happen.
Maybe you just listen to me once, you know, instead of always listening to your asshole friend.
Hope you geniuses aren't planning another science experiment.
Hey, if I'm looking to get date raped,
I'll invite you into the conversation.
- Are you all right, Father?

Father?
You know I've always been devout.
I've...
I believe in the Bible.

Do you think you lost your faith, Father?
Lose my faith?

I've just seen a demon appear and the smoke rising from the pit to torment mankind just as it's written in Gospel.
I'm not scared because I'm losing my faith.
I'm scared because it's stronger than ever.
If we were judged right now, how many under our roof would burn?
Would Mrs. Raven?
Or will God forgive her because she's gone crazy?
Would the Chief?
We've all seen his pride.
Would you?
Would you?
The more I believe, the more I know it's my responsibility to save them... and I've never been more afraid.
Are you there?
Are you there?
Are you there?
Who are you looking for, Natalie?
I don't know yet.
Friends, would you gather, please?
- Mrs. Raven?

Most of you have been coming here for years.
Most of you know me, just as I know you and your families.
We know each other too well for me to...
- preach.

Instead, I will talk to you here.
I believe Judgment Day has come.
And I'm...

I...

I...
I listen to music.
I have a beer every now and then.
I'm not the Judgment Day kind of guy.
You know that.
And yet, here we are.
I hope I'm wrong.
I hope the police get here to save us.
But until then,
I will do whatever I can to help save your souls... pray with you.
Mrs. Raven, please.
That's very sweet, Father, but there's really no need.
The moth is a good friend of mine.
And how is that possible?
We met in my garden the other day.
She landed on my hand.
Will you care to explain to us what it was doing here, then?
I don't know, but I'll find out.
Are you there?
I didn't see any cars out there.
There's nothing in here, either.
Maybe this guy will give us a ride.
Any way to get any gas out of those?
I wouldn't want to be out there long enough to find out.
You're Eve's husband, right?
Yeah.
You know where she is?
I'm sorry.
I'm Clay.
Kevin.
I had a kid in her class.

He was outside when all this happened.
He's safe somewhere.

I'm sure he is.
Have you seen him?
No.
Sorry.
You should, uh...
You should stay here, get some rest.
I haven't slept in two days.
You can, uh, put it in the garage.
Please tell me why we're lying to this poor bastard.
We should tell him.
He has a working car, and in case you haven't noticed, we're kinda stuck here.
It's your wife and kid.
Like you care about them.
I'll talk to him.

Good.
You gonna keep your mouth shut?
I don't know.

Oh.

Uh... it's okay.
I guess you think I'm crazy as well.
- Kind of.

Can I do anything?
They took my gun.
I don't think they'll rob a bank.
I just let three prisoners escape in front of the whole church.
So what?
It's my job to enforce the law.
Oh, the law is just people trying to control human nature, as if that were possible.
No one can do that, not even you.
Thanks, Natalie.
There will be food soon, if you want.
Natalie?
Uh, I think my presence makes Father Romanov uncomfortable.
I insist.
You need to eat, honey.
But it's so dark.
I didn't like the dark either, until my dad found a cure.
He made up a story called "The Owl Who Says What."
He even wrote a book about it.
Owls say, "Who."
Yeah, not this one.
The other owls left him by himself alone in the dark, because he was different.
- Was he scared?

How?
I could read it to you if you want.
I'm sure the bookstore has it.
You want to go?
We're gonna go to the bookstore.
I guess.

I'll tidy up.
She adores her father.
He must be a good guy.
He is.
How bad is it between you and him?
Is it that obvious?
I was married for 10 years.
I mean, not married, because we couldn't get married, but we lived together, and I loved her.
But she was the most annoying person I've ever met.
I know a frustrated woman when I see one.
Kevin's a good person.
He's kind and sensitive.
He's patient.

He sounds awful.
His love for Alex is endless.
He needs her love to be the same.
He needs it so much, he can't say no.
He never could.
And now, it put her in danger.
I'm happy he's not here.
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, bless us, O Lord, and these, thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
In the name of the Father and of the Son
- and the Holy Spirit, amen.

What are you reading, Mrs. Raven?
The journal of one of the first priests here.
I found it in your office.
Well, if you have any questions about church history,
I'd be happy to help.
Did you know this is not the first time nature's come alive?
Six people were killed by wildlife here in Bridgeville on May 12th in 1860.
Five more the next day.
Three more the following.
And you think this is related to what we saw outside?
Of course.

Natalie, I...
You're looking for answers.
We're all looking for answers.

But I beg you, look in the Bible.
Your answers are there.
Not just to this, to your pain as well.
Why look f...
Do you even know what you're looking for?
There it is.
What?
What I'm looking for.
Ooh, that's a big one.
- Oh, I got it.

I found it.
Thank you.
Dinner is served.
Thanks.
I'm sorry about the gun.
You see anyone else when you were out there?
We've been trying to find a car.

You haven't been out in a while, have you?
Cars stopped working.
No, we drove through the mist when we first got here.
Yeah, but I was out driving yesterday, looking.
Couple people on the road trying to get away, I guess.
Then they just stopped at the same time, just like that.
I've seen a couple working since then, but most of them just died.
I got this from one of those survivalist types.
I wanted a family car, but Toby thought it was so cool.
Guy said he bought it because it was a bug-out vehicle, you know, so old it didn't have a circuit board, in case aliens or whatever came and fried our technology.
I...

I just know it's one of the only ones that works.
You should've seen how proud Toby was riding in it.
You know, Eve and I, we have a daughter.
Her name is Alex.
Where are they?
They're at the mall.
It's where I've been trying to go.
I was hoping you could drive us.
I...

I'm sorry.
Do me a favor, and just sleep on it, all right?
All right.
"There once was an owl who said, 'What, ' and not, 'Who.'"
You're sure about this, right?
You prefer to keep listening to them bitching about us being childish, or do you want to be a hero, and have Zoe be all, "Mmm, you're my Mr. Strong Man.
I want you so bad, Ted"?
- Yo, stop it!

Your tiny, little arms are turning me on."
Okay.

Besides, we don't have to go out there.
Picked this up in sporting goods.
Fucking boom.
I mean, you're a sick bastard.
Mm-hmm.
Let's do this.
We're sure this is safe, right?
We served up two soldiers in a shopping cart, not even a nibble.
And if we see something, we'll just close the door, okay?
Okay.
Did you hear something?
It's fine.
Let's reel it in.
- You got it?

Okay, okay.
There she is.
I'll get the door.
"Then the owl said, 'Who are you to say
I can't say "what" '?
But the other owls just said, 'Who, who, who.'"
That's not nice of them.
Okay, next one.

- Oh, shit.

Wait, wait. wait.

Hey, screw it.

Don't let go of the line.
Otherwise, I might not find my way.
Ted.
Ted?
Ted?
Ted!
Um, stay here.
Ted!
Help!

Help!

Somebody!
Lila!
Lila!
- Lila?

- Where are you?

I know, but we gotta go, okay?
Oh, my God!

I didn't mean to do it!

- Where?

Run!
- Jesus.

Yeah, the Copeland girl.
Alex, help!
- Where are you?

- Lila!

Holy shit!
What the fuck is that?
Is she in there?

No, no, no.

- Don't let it in!

Don't!

- We open the door, we all die!

Alex!
Look, I didn't know she was in there.
Mom!
- You can't go in there.

Run, baby!
Run!
No!
Lila!
Eve.
You okay?

You okay?

I just...
I...

I am concerned about her.
She's always had some funny ideas.
But she's hurting herself.
Last night, she referred to the spider as God.
First the moth, then this.
It is idolatry.
If this is Judgment Day, she will be judged for it.
And if it's not?
You haven't been out there, not the way I have.
When I was,
I felt something.
What did you feel?
That it knew me.
I'm sorry.
Please.
I have to look out for my boy.
You'd do the same.
You have the only working car.
You're my only chance.
- You understand that?

Are you gonna tell him, or should I?
Mia, I'm taking care of this.
Well, if you were, we wouldn't have spent the night sleeping in a goddamn minimart.
There is nothing that you can say to help.
Look, your son is dead.
We saw him.
You're lying.
I'm sorry, but it's the truth.
You're lying.
You're lying.
You didn't see what we saw.
If you had, you'd understand.
No, you would have told me when I showed you the photo.
You're lying.

I'm not gonna do it!

He's alive!

Tell him.
Tell him!
He's dead.
I told them not to tell you.
Why?
I didn't want to take away your hope.
I'm sorry.
- I truly am.

He's not coming back.

Just shut up!
You are not gonna get the car!
You're not gonna get the car!
I will kill you all, if I have to!
Shoot him!
Come on!

I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to.
Get the towel.
Do you have a belt?
Here, put pressure.
If we don't get him to a hospital, he's gonna die.
I'm so sorry.
But you have to understand, it really was an accident.
We were trying to do the right thing.

Shelley lost her little girl because of it.
And I'm so sorry.
I promise.

That's what you said after sending my friends out in the mist.
Don't look at me.

So what do we do?
Zoe was closer to Ted than any of us.
She should have a chance to speak.
What do I think?
Anyone who endangers the group is thrown out!
- Are those the rules, or aren't they?

I say we put it to a vote!
Maybe we should wait... until the police get here.
The police?
That's who you're waiting for?

Well, tell me, what would he do if he were here?
Because the Officer Heisel I know isn't a pussy like you.
This should be decided by all of us.
We put it to a vote, okay?
Everyone in favor of forgiving Vic for violating the rules, please raise your hands.
All those in favor of expelling Vic from the mall, per the rules as agreed upon by the group.
You're killing me.
Would you grab a hiking pack from the store and gather Vic's things for him?
Put together, uh, three days' provisions, a flashlight, and a means of defending himself.
Hello.
There...
Natalie, please.

Oh, please don't be afraid.
I know these creatures.
They would never harm us.
You saw what happened to Mikhail.
I'm sure it had a reason.
Have you ever experienced nature not having a reason?
Mother Earth is never wrong.
She knows what she's doing, and so will we if we observe her.
Father, I...

She's worshipping a false god in your church.
I can't reach her.
When you met me, I was unreachable.
That was different.
You knew exactly what you were doing.
I'm sure to an outsider, it would've looked cruel... but you reached me.
Father, you reached me.
I know that this may seem harsh, but if I can save your soul, it will be worth it.
I need you to kill the spider.
I will do no such thing.
Please.

- Save yourself.

Mrs. Raven, I'm not punishing you.
I am trying to help you.
Now, please kill the spider.
Absolutely not!
No!

Please!
No!

Jay, come on.

They didn't throw you out.

Everyone makes mistakes.

This is what we voted for.
We have to be safe in here.
Get your hands off me!

Fuck you!
Fuck all of you!
I know that my actions today appeared cold and callous, but I beg of you to understand that they are the opposite, that they are an act of charity,
of helping a lost soul find her way to Heaven.
You asked me what I thought was happening.
I'm not asking anymore.
I would like to answer.
We're not interested.
No one is interested!
I am.
I am.
That's okay.
I lied.
What do you mean?
I didn't fight.
I didn't do anything.
I just waited for it to kill me.
It came, it looked at me, and it left.
Why did't it want me?
Shelley, I'm so sorry.
I don't want to be with those people anymore.
You can stay here.
Kyle, will you get a blanket for Shelley?
Here.

Thanks.
You were right.
Alex is a liar.
We need to go.
I need to look for my son.
Come with us.
You should get in the car now.
Clay.
He's out there.
I know it.
Okay.
