So we threw a blanket on him.
We also found a needle in the cab.
My son Jay's not doin' too well.
His girlfriend left him, took the kid.
He quit fighting.

With Khalis Capital.
We're the guys that bought King Beast.
Look, my bosses, they weren't happy with the fee you negotiated for your fighter, Alvey.
So have you thought about what you're gonna do?
About the guy calling you a faggot at the fight.
Your dad's gonna hear about it one way or another.
Tell him before someone else does.
I just got off the phone with Terry.
A new guy's gonna be moving in here with us.
- Hello?

Yeah.

Kayla.
What's the deal with this Kayla chick?
Why do her numbers suck?
Yo.

I'm here.

Glove up and meet me in the cage.
I can't even feel you, you fucking pussy.
Fucking Ryan, I mean...
I don't know what the hell's wrong with the guy.
I think he has someone in his ear.
You're not getting the coaching or the attention that you deserve.
What the fuck am I doin'?
Ugh.
There you go.
Take care.
Get down!

Get down!
Stop!

I'm here to see a patient.
Annette Kulina.
- Are you family?

Go ahead, sign in.

There she is.
Okay, go ahead and put this on.
And you are going to head to the Geropsychiatric Center down the hall.
Thanks.
All right.

You want us to go with you?
No, let me go see how she's doing first, check her out.
Why don't you guys go get something to eat?
I'm sure there's a cafeteria.
All right.

Yeah, I don't know.
Just a piece of chicken, plain if they have it.
All right.

- You got money?

Your mother was brought in on a 72-hour hold.
A security guard witnessed her attempting to jump off a parking structure.
Jesus Christ.
Police found an empty bottle of sleeping pills in her car.
We pumped her stomach, but she's still working it out of her system.
Is she on anything now?
She's refusing any psychotropic medication.
Well, can't you make her?
We'd need a court order, and because she's not violent...
She tried to jump off a fucking building.
That's not violent?
It doesn't meet the criteria for involuntary medication.
How'd you know to call me?
She asked for you.
Would you like to see her?
Annette?
Your son's here to see you.
Hey, Ma.
I thought we were... past all this.
You sick?
Something happen?
Can you ask them for my purse, please?
They took all my stuff.
Yeah.

I-I just want my... my stuff.
What the fuck is up with her?
- Who?

I don't know what you're asking me.
Is she gonna sit on her fucking ass all day?
She has shows tonight.
So?

She can't be on camera 24/7.
Why not?

Bitch is always by the pool like it's Spring Break.
Hi!

No.
Not even a little.
No room for a lazy bitch.
- Ryan?

Can we talk?

Guys, can we have the room for a second?

- Sure.

Alvey's in Tucson.
His mother tried to kill herself.
What happened?
I don't have any details.

Should I call him?
I'd give him space.
Joe's gonna take over your camp.

I'm...

That's not an option.
It's my camp.

- Lisa...

- It's my choice.

Why?
'Cause it's not working out.
I like him.

Well, there's more to it than that.
Like what?

- That's just one example.

That's another example.
No, wait, you...
It's your gym, it's your life.
You make your own decisions.
I'm just a fighter.

Hey, man.
Hey, Coach.
Lisa just told me about your mom.
How's she doing?
You know, not too good.

Fuck.

Anything I can do?
No.

Hey, don't worry about me.
No, Ryan, you got a fight coming up.
I wanna make sure you're ready for it, buddy.
I'm ready, Coach.

Listen, I-I...
I'm so sorry about the other day.
What can I say?

Yeah, well, uh, I, too, suffer that affliction.
So we good?
Yeah, Ryan.

Hey, if you, uh...
If you need to vent or anything, I'm around.
Okay, well, you get with Joe and I'll, uh...
I should be home in a couple days.
- Okay?

You got it.
I got the boys, uh, with me.
They're downstairs.
You don't wanna bring 'em up here.
This is where the crazies are.
They'd love to see you.
Did they go through my stuff?
What are you looking for, Mom?
- My cigarettes.

Well, I'll smoke outside.
I had a reaction to some sleeping medication.
And the next thing I know,
I'm being tackled by some man on a roof.
I-I don't even know how I got up there.
You brought a ladder.
Yeah.
You tried to kill yourself.
I wanna go home.
You're on a 72-hour hold, Mom.
Can't you sign me out?
You need to be here.
You need to let these doctors help you.
I'm not really asking you to do anything.
I just want you to sign some forms so that I can go home, you can go back to Los Angeles.
What'd you come here for if you're not gonna help me?
Because you told them to call me.
I don't remember that.
Ma...
You don't have to feel like this anymore.
Do you understand?
They... they got...

I-I tried it myself.

I'm tired, Alvey.
I want you to please leave now.
Okay.
I'm coming back tomorrow.
You get some rest.
You'll feel better once all this... these pills are out of your system.
Get some rest.
Dom?

I got a class.
They'll be okay.

- Open or closed?

You're fired.
Okay.
Wow.
Wow.
You let Ryan know about this?
Yeah.

Come on.
I mean, he knew all about us.
I mean, it was... it was obvious.
Don't sit.

I'm sorry, Lisa.
Come on.

We were both drunk.

And it's not the end of the world, right?
I'm a...

No, you're a fucking cancer.
I'm trying to help you guys out.
- You're trying to help us?

No, you're trying to help yourself.
You latched onto Ryan like a fucking leech.
He's got a fight coming up, and I'm trying to help him.
Yeah, that's not your job.
Actually, you were explicitly told to leave him the fuck alone.
The kid comes up to me like I'm his fucking shrink.
I don't...

This is your final check.

Fuck that.
I'm not going anywhere.
Take the check or I'll call the police.
You're gonna call the fucking police on me?
Take the check and leave.
This is why you don't let a woman run a gym.
No one lets me run the gym.

You know what your problem is?
Hmm?
You're taking this too personal.
You're too fucking emotional.
I could fuck shit up for you... so fucking bad.
So bad, mama.
There's so many fighters here that aren't happy.
And I can clean you the fuck out.
Please don't make me call the police.
Fine.

I don't wanna go out like that.
You know what I mean?
It didn't work.

You know?

Mama, we tried.
No?

All right, all right.
Good luck to you and Alvey.
Yes.

I just wanna make you boys happy.
Rohan42, you are a filthy, filthy man.
Nah, ladies don't do that.
Well...

Do you wanna see them?
Well, first you guys are gonna have to show me some love.
Thank you.

Okay.

Is that what you wanted?
What...

Can you guys hear me?

Come on.
Fucking piece of shit.
Cody.
Cody?
Yo, what the fuck?

- My camera's broken.

So I'm in the middle of a show.
So solve the fucking problem.

You're the boss, Cody.

- Use someone else's.

Well, what the fuck do you think we should do?
- Buy a new one.

You took away the credit card.
Can I borrow it, please?
Hop up, gorgeous.
You know what?
Lindsay, go outside, get some sun.
I'll be out there in a minute.
I don't know how things were with Terry, but I don't like your fucking tone.
It's almost like you're the boss and I'm the bitch.
I'm sorry you took it that way.
You know, I could fuck you in your ass right now if I wanted.
Say it.
- Say what?

You could fuck my ass.
- When?

Here you go.
Hold on.
Yeah, Kayla's done.

- No.

- I want some new girls.

See?

- I need a reason.

She's your girl.

Actually, she's Terry's girl.
Yeah?

She's gone tonight.
Do it or I will.
You fucking bitch.
You think it's okay to smoke in here?
Ha.
Is that a note?
Looks like a note.
There's nothing here.
Why don't you guys go grab some dinner?
Do you want something?
Nah, I'll eat the chicken.
Oh.
Grab me some booze.
I want change.
Jay?
With me.
- Where we going?

Come in!
I'm a sophomore.

Kayla, I have some bad news.
What?
You have to move out.

Why?
Cody wants some new girls.
I-I am new.

He just wants to go a different way.
- What did I do?

God, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Can you change his mind?
I don't think so.
I-I can...

- before any of the girls wake up and...

I will literally do anything.

And I'll...

Kayla, don't... don't...
Try... try telling him you want me to stay.
Try?
Please?
Please, Christina.

Please don't make me leave.
Christina, please?
If you don't have the money,
I'll buy your ticket back to Florida.
I'm...

Don't worry about that.

What?

We're leaving soon.
Hey.

My man.
I feel like I let you down.
How's that?

You got a fight coming up, you know?
Your fucking coach is in Arizona.
The last thing you need is another... you know, distraction, right?
I've lived through worse.
Cheers.
Fucking...
Fucking pissed at myself, you know?
Should've just fucking, you know, keep my head down.
Keep my fucking head down.
She did give you a couple chances, man.
She did.

I just can't keep my fucking mouth shut.
You know what I mean?
Ain't the first job that it...

Hey, man.
You're a good coach, dude.
You'll find something better.
Ready?
Where you taking me?
Burbank.
We'll buy your ticket at the counter.
I'm not going back to Florida.
I thought your family was there.
Where are they?
They don't talk to me.
Ah.
Go put your bags in the car.

Alvey brought us to New York one Christmas.
It was freezing.
Fucking cold.
What was she like?
Well, she was a nice lady.
- Really damaged, breakable, nervous.

I think Alvey's old man put her through the fucking ringer.
She wore a lot of makeup.

Oh.
Hey.
Hi.
Are you home?
No, Nate and I are in the Old Pueblo.
Where?
We are in Tucson, Arizona, Mom.
What are you doing there?
Alvey's mom tried to kill herself.
Oh, fuck.
Is she okay?
I wouldn't say she's okay.

I flew out with Nate and Alvey.
Well, that was nice of you.
Well, I didn't want Nate to come out here and be alone.
Have you seen her?
No, she's on a psych hold, Mom.

Well...
I need a favor, but I-I almost hate to ask now.
No.

A friend of mine is in a bad spot and she needs a place to stay.
Any way she could crash at your house?
I feel like we've done this before.
Right?
No, this is different.

So my mom's not gonna end up in zip ties and my home isn't gonna get robbed?
She's just a girl who needs a little charity.
Well...
I don't say no to charity.
- I know you don't.

The key is under the motorcycle tire in the back.
All right?

Hey, it's me.
Um...
I'm just calling to check in, uh, on how your mom's doing, and...
You're probably still at the hospital.
Um...
I'm sorry this is happening to you so close to your fight, but as we know, horrible shit doesn't really give a fuck.
I fired Dom.
He went quietly.

I don't know what I was thinking.
We never should've let him step foot in this gym.
We could've handled it.

Anyway, um...
I want you to know I'm thinking of you.
And if you wanna talk, I'm here.
Okay.

Ahh.
Disgusting.
What are you doing?

I'm smoking.
- You said we could smoke in here.

We're still eating.

Does he do this?
See, my father used to do that.

Don't worry about it.
You are so fucking low-rent.
You really are.
Well, maybe in this country, Alvey, but Cuba would disagree with you, as would many Balkan states.
- The tinderbox of Europe...

Will you put the cigarette out, please?
Please?
Please?
- Thank you.

How's that chicken?
This chicken?
This chicken's perfect, man.
It's exactly how I like it...

- Cuttin' weight sucks.

It's not about cuttin' weight.

You fucking goats should try it sometime.
I hardly call that eating clean.
Hospital bird.

That's a boneless breast of death... and cholera.
Mmm.
- Is that good?

Give me a piece of your fucking pizza.
- Mm-hmm.

That's so much better.
Did she say anything to you?
Why?
Mnh-mnh.
I mean, she didn't call me up here to talk.
She wants me to check her out so she can come back here and fucking try it again, I guess.
She tried this before?
Yeah.
I was 15.
Came home from the gym one day, early.
She wasn't expecting me.
30 seconds into the house, I hear a crash.
I run into the bathroom, and... she's on the floor with a belt around her neck and the... and the... shower curtain is bent in half.
I pick her up, I put her in her bed.
She begged me not to fucking tell my father.
Said she's never do it again, so...
I didn't tell him, you know?
Like he never told me when he found her.
The woman never had an interest in living.
She's depressed.
They can try putting her on medication.
Might help, you know?
She won't take pills.

Someone really wants to die, you... you can't get 'em off it, you know?
It's... it's a fucking mission.
It's really the only thing I've ever seen her give a shit about.
Sorry, Dad.
Which one do you think?
Nate's is probably cleaner.

Okay.

Kayla, it's only for a night or two till the boys come back.
And I don't want any men here.
Neither do I.
You need to figure out where you're gonna go.
I'm gonna call a bunch of people tonight.
Do you know anyone in Vegas?
Not anymore.

I heard it's really awesome out there.
I might just, like, go.
Do some research first.
Yeah.

I'll just see who's out there.
Are you hungry?
I can make you something before I go.
Do you mind?

Let's see what we got.
Fuck.
Mmm.
Aw, jeez.

You want some?
Fuck, no.

We'll drink responsibly.
Yeah, he will.

I'm turning in.

Hey.
I want us to communicate more.
Talk.
Tonight?
No, not tonight, you fucking smart-ass.
I mean in general, you know.
I don't wanna be on my f...

I want us to work on that.
- Okay?

You're an asshole.
I'm going to bed now.
Aye-aye, Captain.
Fucking soap opera, man.

I can't work in that environment, you know what I mean?
Can't train in that environment.
Families are like that.
But it's not family, Ryan.
It's not family.

What the fuck is Alvey thinking?
How you gonna run a gym with a chick that you used to be with?
On what fucking planet does that work?
What fucking planet does that work?
They figured it out.
Have they?
They've been with me through a lot of shit.
I guess so.
- Can I be straight with you?

You know I've worked with a lot of fighters.
I've never seen... a guy with your talent.
You got all the fucking tools, my man.
But Alvey?
He got you stuck in neutral, man.
I don't know about that, man.

You're getting by because you're a superior athlete.
I-I'm talking about... next fucking level.
Alvey, knows his shit.
I'm-a...

I'm a fan, man.
I could acknowledge that.
But he's stuck in his ways, man.
He's living 10 years ago.
He ain't tryin' to fucking evolve.
He ain't tryin' to educate himself on the fucking game, man.
I won a lot of fights with him.
Well, then you're comfortable.
I don't think you're growing as a fighter.
I'm just being...
I'm being honest right now.
I liked you better when you were full of shit, bro.
I think you're special.
What?
Does that make you feel uncomfortable right now?
You're special.
I'm not trying to fuck you.

You know what I mean?
I wouldn't be saying this if you were just a guy.
You could be great.
What do you think I need to do?
We need to change the game.
And we're gonna do this shit together.
Mm-hmm.

I know that.

The last thing I wanna do is poach a fighter.
But you are fucking different.
Brother, I know it feels dirty, man.
I know it fucking feels dirty.
It is fucking dirty.

You owe it to yourself, Ryan.
Not many guys get another shot at this.
Okay.
Where do you think I can be better?
I think you take too much punishment.
You get hit way too much.
We need to weaponize that right hand.
You need to knock fuckers out.
By the way, sponsors, they love that shit.
That's how we get paid.
You knocking motherfuckers out how we get paid.

In the short term, brother... we work out of Black House.
Eh.

I'm already looking at spaces.
You're gonna open up your own gym?
My man.
My man, that's my fucking dream, bro.
My fucking dream.
And I'm not talking about that bullshit franchise shit.
I'm talking about we keep that motherfucker small.
We keep it killers only.
I'm-a cut you in on this shit.
Yeah.
I'm gonna give you a piece.
And you don't have to put nothing down.
Nothing down.

Huh?
Let me get another round when you get a chance.
- Got it.

Um...
I think, uh...
Yeah, yeah?
I think... if you were good enough to be my coach, you'd be my coach, but you're not.
Be good, man.
I'll see you around.
We just have to get... get her back.
Like an Amber Alert situation?
Are we talkin' child fucking abduction, Nathaniel?
Crossing interstate lines?
Yep.
I'm gonna get a-a white van, unmarked, no windows.
Nope.

You gotta steal a Prius or something.
You've thought about this, huh?
Of course I've fucking thought about this.
I've dug a fucking bunker.
I have keys for you, should you want to join.
We're gonna get that fucking baby back.
Amy loved you.
She loved you once, she can love you again.
Mm.
You're a naive young man.
Okay, you freaked out.
And rightfully so, because you were trying to be someone you're not, which, I don't know if you know this, is completely impossible for you.
But she loved you, and you just have to get back to that.
She didn't grow up like us.
On my best fucking day I'm drinking out of their garden hose.
When did you become such a fucking pussy?
My formative years.
I mean, I hear what you're saying.
I hear what you're saying.

But I fucked up.
I fucked up and I know that.
And I think it's only fair to just leave Amy alone.
What I don't want is to be Maya's shithead dad somewhere in fucking nowhere California.
That, man, that I am trying really fucking hard... not to be.
Well...
Yeah.
Ahh.
How is it?
It's good.
My boys eat a lot of oatmeal.
Can I ask you a question, and you'll tell me the truth?
Mm-hmm.
Why don't people like me?
They do.

I know they don't.
I love to make people smile and be fun, and I just feel like I'm always annoying people.
I just feel like people hate me.
- Nobody hates you.

Oh.

What do you want with a guy like Cody?
- He's successful and he has money...

He's not successful at all.
He looks at me like he hates me, and I don't know what I did.
Listen, Kayla, if you're gonna survive in this business, you have to protect yourself.
Don't fall in love.
Don't go looking for a new father.

These are not your friends.
Good men don't sell girls.
Remember that.
Hey.
Hey.

No, no.

Jay told me what happened.
Yeah.
Well, she knows what she wants.

I had a feeling she was up to something when she sent you those pictures.
I should've said something.
I knew it, too.
Wouldn't have mattered.
Did she say why?
She doesn't wanna talk about it.
She's probably embarrassed.
What's the note say?
Want me to read it to you?
It's short.
Only if you want to.
"Alvey, please forgive me for this,
"but I've passed any enjoyment in life
"and did not want to be a burden on you.
"My life was good.

He was a better man than you remember."
"My only regret is that you never knew how proud of you I am."
- "I don't know why

Please find happiness in your life.

That's it.
Yeah?

Yeah.

Bye.
Hey.
What's up?
I found this in my bag.
Thought you didn't have it.
Sometimes I lie.
Night, son.
