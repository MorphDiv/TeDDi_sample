It had to be a cow.
Couldn't be like a dog or something that isn't 10,000 pounds.
Come on!

I'm doing all the work here, man.
- Push!

Pull yourself together.
Just tie it to the bench
- and let's get out of here, please.

Well, it shouldn't be unhappy, because I just milked her.
Him.
- You just milked him.

- Was it one udder?

Yeah, that's not an udder, dude.
I was gonna say, it was actually kinda weird.
It was really big, and I had to use two hands.
It didn't...
Stop.

That'd be great.
Cops!
The cops are coming.
Beefcake, hide!
What?

Whoo!
Yeah!
Damn!
Whoa!
Okay.
Come on.
Whoo!

Whoa!
Whoa!
You know, I don't think we're ever gonna understand each other.
Just when I think you've done the dumbest thing you could possibly do, you find something even dumber and you do it.
Thank you.
I promise you, this is not the moment to be a wiseass.
And I know you think it's noble that you didn't rat out your friends.
I acted alone.

Yeah, that's funny.

This was supposed to be your season.
I had scouts coming to every game.
You could have written your own ticket.

Now you gotta come here every Saturday for the rest of the year just so you can graduate!
With all these other weirdos and criminals.
Yeah.
Like you said, we'll never understand each other.
One play left in the entire game.
Can Angel Grove do it?

Jason Scott takes his position at quarterback.

Wide receiver Marty Borne looks like he's open.
He's getting ready for a pass.
Jason Scott makes...

What a pump fake!

He's at the 20, the 15, the ten.

Touchdown!
Jason Scott singlehandedly brings the team home for the championship!
Moo!
That's so funny.
Hey, you sure you're in the right room?
Oh, big tough guy.
This one goes here.

Primary colors go on this side, this one goes...
I'm sorry.
Here, let me help you.
You're a freak.

I've had to watch you play with these for weeks.
Are you crazy?
No?

Freak.
Why don't you cut this little act and do something?
Why don't you stop me?

- Are you gonna stop...

How old are you?

Hi, I'm Jason.

And you must be the bully of detention.
How dumb can you be?
Oh!
Did you just slap me?
I did.

Now I'm gonna be here every day for what seems like the rest of my life, and I'm sure that you are, too.
So let's make a deal.
Don't sit near me, or him, and we'll be okay.
Okay!
Uh, approved homework, or working on the Better Choices workbook.
- These should be out and in progress.

Uh...

Oh, my God.
I got your text and I was like, "Where are they?"
So, this is where you come every Saturday instead of practice.
- God, this must suck.

Well, then you shouldn't have sent Ty that picture of me.
That's not exactly how it happened.

- You punched his tooth out.

Water under the bridge now.

Oh, thank God.
We're moving on.

Cutting you out.

You can show up for cheer practice if you want, but I wouldn't.
Damn, girl!
Oh, my God, what have you done?
Kimberly, what have you done to your hair?
You cut off your hair?
- Hey... door!

Hey, thanks for that in there.
Ah, no worries.

Yeah.

Not that we have to.

- What's your name again?

Billy Cranston.
Or William Cranston.
You remember kids used to call me Billy Crams-tons as a third-grade joke?
Like Billy crams tons of crayons in his butt.
Which I didn't!

- No, no, I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that.

I would honestly hang outwith you, but I have a date every night with the Angel Grove Sheriff's Department.
So...

Wait... no, no, no.

All right, so I don't really expect for us to hang out.
Truth is I need to get somewhere tonight, and I could really use your help.
Billy, I hear you, but as I told you, I have house arrest.
There's nothing I can do about it.

Well, like, I mean, I can fix that.
I know how to trick the SIM.

I have to be in my house before 7:00.
Well, if you come to my house before 7:00, then I can fix it for you.
Oh!

And if you decide to help me, you can have the car for a few hours.
Come on, honey.

Don't be so hard on him.
How do you think he feels walking around town now?
How do you think I feel walking around town now?
Let's not do this tonight.
What's the plan, huh?
What's he gonna do with his life?
He could've been so much more.
Get out of the way!
Oh, my God, is that Jason Scott?
Oh, my God!

- Billy?

- Billy!

- It's 6:56...

You got four minutes.

- What's all this stuff?

Most of it is his.
- Hey.

Here.

- Put your foot in this.

It's a Faraday cage. it should stop the cell signal if we're lucky.
That's the three-minute warning.
- Come on, bud.

- Yeah, two days.

That's a long time.

Billy, I really don't think that we have time...
You still live at 4455 Old Wharf?
- Yes... yes, I do.

- Okay.

We used to go and find objects together.
Some really, really old.
I'm gonna get in trouble, Billy.
Oh!

Billy, the signal's gonna go off.
We should've definitely had our own TV show.
That would've been so crazy.
What are you doing?
Dude, come on, seriously!
It's gonna go...

What?
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

It's so cool you actually showed up.
Well, you are giving me the van.
Lending you the van.

How much further is it?
Just 44 minutes and 52 seconds.
Uh...

Thank you for helping me today.
That's okay, Billy.
Uh...

Keep driving.
Okay.
If we find something cool, then you can keep half.
- It's a rule that me and my dad made.

They're gonna blow this whole thing.
It'll all be gone in a week.
Billy, can I be honest?

This is weird.
Like, we don't know each other at all.
I don't know what we're doing here.
- And you seem kinda...

I'm on the spectrum.
Well, is that like a workout program?
Like Tae Bo?
No.

I know.

See, that's the thing.

Like my brain doesn't work the same as yours does, you know?
Yeah, well, consider that a good thing.
It's just that I can't read humor or... or sarcasm.
- Oh!

- I remember everything.

Billy, let me stop you.
Okay.
You don't need to tell me all this.

Okay.

Which is good news, so...
Take my spare flashlight now, 'cause it's gonna be dark
- when we get back.

Okay!
Ah, she's back again.
Oh, crazy girl.
Just like clockwork.
Who are you?
No way!
Uh... hello?
Hey!
Hey!
No, no, no, no.

Kimberly!
Okay.

- It's strange to hear you say my name.

What did you say?
I said, it's strange to hear you say my name.
Like we know each other.
We...

Oh, we know who each other are, but we don't really know each other.
I know you used to date Ty Fleming.
Oh.

I know they put it back.
Dad, I hope you're watching.

Dad, I forgot to tell you, uh,
I took the van without asking Mom's permission.
Well, I'm telling you, so I think that's okay.
Anyways, I gotta focus.

So what are you doing up here?

I, uh, came with...

Billy Cranston?

My house is on the other side of the mountain.
I hike these trails sometimes, clear my head, and I stare down at Angel Grove and wonder how such a small, crap town could cause me such misery.
That funny to you?
No, I just...

Yeah.

Destroys his career and destroys our season.
Go Tigers.
Yeah, now I walk around town and everyone's looking at me like I ran over their dog.
So why don't you leave?

- I could leave here, you know?

God, anywhere.
So let's go.
What?
- You'd never do it.

Oh, what, you and me?

- I have a van.

It's not that kind of van.
Every van is that kind of van.
So, let's go.
Are you daring me?

Okay.
Dad, get ready.
That didn't work.
Whoa!

- That really rung my bell.

Go, go, go, go, go!
- Oh!

What are you doing, dude?
I been digging up here for some years.
Hey!

- I seen him up here before.

Dude cannot be walking around blowing stuff up!
I was just trying to dig a little deeper!
Maybe I dug too deep, huh?
Billy, you don't have to yell.

- Okay!

You guys looking to get busted or something?
This place is a restricted area!
Oh, really, Einstein?

As in, we shouldn't be standing on crazy rocks doing Karate Kid moves, right?
Uh...

Yeah.

Yeah, or camping out on old trains.

Uh, guys...
There's a lotta mine security out tonight.
- Who is she?

I've never seen her before.
Oh, no.
Whoa!
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
Whoa.
What is it?
Whoa.
I've never seen glass like this before.
Oh, my God.
What is it?

There's something in there.
Move.
- All right, watch out, watch out.

- Wait, no, no, no!

- What are you doing?

My dad always knew the right spots.
There's gotta be more.

- Get out of the way.

Oh!
What is it?
What is that?
- What?

Don't break it!

You broke it.

Wow.

- Oh, my God.

Yo, look, we all found these.
- If they're worth any money...

Now chill out.
- Chill out?

Mine security.

Somebody should have pointed that out.

Billy!
- Wait, okay, okay.

Billy!

Billy, let's go!
- Haul ass, dude!

Are you kidding me?
Ja...

- What are you doing?

Open the door!
- Yes, okay, just get in.

Did you see them?

- I don't know.

Okay, what about the others?
- You gonna leave the others?

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Whoo!
- Oh, my mom's gonna kill me.

- Shit!

- Jason!

- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Whoa!
- There they are!

- Up the hill.

Okay!
- Okay, you drive.

Okay, then really don't drive, so I can pull them in.
I don't drive!
Get your foot!
- I got it.

That's because it's open, Billy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Go, go, go!

There they are!

Get in!
Gotcha.
- I gotcha!

What about the other guy?
- Just go!

Billy, look out!
Let's go downhill!

- You wanna drive now?

- we're almost there.

We got it.
Okay.
- Oh, my God!

Hey!
Hey, what do you want me to do?
- Hey!

Okay.
Are you crazy?
Yeah, I am.
Yo, it's catching up.
Look, there's the railroad crossing.

- You got it.

I hope he has it.
- He definitely doesn't have it.

Storm's turned.

Let's go!
Let's go!
Pull it port!
Pull up the net!
Let's go, boys!

A little more starboard!
Let her go!
What the hell is that?
Get back!
- Wide to the port!

Okay.
Billy!

What?
- Where's your bodyguard?

I'm just gonna quietly snap your wrist, you little bitch.
Oh, no, no, no.

Billy Cranston just knocked Colt Wallace out cold!

What happened?

- I didn't see it!

Hey.

- Am I crazy or this is crazy, right?

We got hit by a train and we're standing here.
How is that possible?
I don't remember getting home from the mine at all.
I slept all day yesterday.
We gotta find Billy.
You know I wasn't trying to start any trouble or anything like that.
And I say, "Hey, man, look, I'm not a violent person.
But if you must come at me, come at me, bro."
- Sweet!

Boom!

- Down goes...

Hey, Kimberly...

We need to talk.
How... what?
- Since when does he know Kimberly Hart?

Nice hair.
- Billy, look at me.

Do you feel weird?
You mean like weirder than usual?
Yeah.

Oh.
Listen, we know something happened up there, okay?
I'm not the same.
Me either.

- How strong?

I feel like we need to go back up there.
The counter's boiling.
We're going back today.
Yeah.
Come on up.
Oh, she's down here.
So you're sure it's a woman?
Not a great-looking woman.

Oh, that smell is... it's intense.
You should make a note of that.
Smell inside an old fishing boat that holds tons of dead fish doesn't smell so good.
Freaky, right?
- Look, do you need us?

All right, 'cause I need to get to bed.
Lock up when you're done.

Jesus.
Jesus.
Unit two, this is Meinen.
I have a body.

Let's just keep going.
Guys, look.

Find anything interesting?
If I do, I'm keeping it!
- We know why you're here.

You guys wake up surprised to be alive and jump over a house?
Yeah.

Look, we're different, all right?

Uh, you're Zack, right?
Yup.
You still go to Angel Grove?
Ha!

You know, the other girl was here too, about an hour ago.
Hey, you mean that girl right there?
Hey!

We should figure this out together!
- Whoa.

- Okay, let me handle this.

No, no, no!
Yo, keep up.
Stop!
Just...

You have a coin.

We should just talk about this.

- Whoa!

Whoa.
Oh, you're crazy!

- Whoa, Zack.

- Wait, wait.

- What are you doing?

Hey!
- I got her!

Just jump over.
Let's go.

No, no, no!

- Don't jump.

- Piece o' cake.

Don't, don't!

That's not a piece o' cake!
- You all right?

You got this, Billy!
No, I don't!
- It's fun.

- Come on, let's go, dude.

- We all did it.

Come on, do it, dude.

The drop is probably more than 100 feet, which means death is imminent.
Okay, so if you die, Billy, what's gonna happen?
Okay, your mom'll be alone.
But it's okay 'cause she could find somebody else.
But she couldn't, 'cause you love your mom
- and you won't really...

He'll come across, he's fine.
Okay.

Visualize jumping across!
- And then do it!

Okay!
Billy, you got this!
Whoa!

Whoa!
- Are you okay?

- Come on, climb up.

- Billy, you got it.

See, what'd we tell you, Billy?

Told you.

- Whoo!

Billy, right!

- Whoa!

- Oh, my God!

Billy!
Billy!
- No, no, no, no, no.

- We just kill that dude?

No, no, no, no, no, no.
Hey, guys, you gotta come down here!
It's water!

Yo, all right!

Uh... bring that crazy girl.
Come on, you guys, let's go!

Whoa!
Uh, hey... could I get a sip of your water?
I'm dying.
Okay.

Thanks.

Sorry for what?
Whoa!
Yeah!
Welcome to the club!
'Sup, crazy girl?
We gotta do that again.
Oh, thank goodness.
- Hey, guys.

- Check out how we glow.

- Oh, yeah!

I'm blue!
That's not my favorite color, but it's cool.
I'm black!
- What?

No, you're not.
Hey, guys.

- Where are we?

Jason, I'm sliding!
- Hi.

Well, that is unusual.
This just gets better and better.
Do you feel that?
There's something out here.
The walls are shaking.
Come on.
That's impossible.
This must have been here for millions of years.
I mean, look how the rock has grown around it.
I don't like this place.
Hey, guys.
Check it out.
- Okay.

- Holy sh...

- What?

It's so cold in here.
Jason, is this real?
Like, are we really in a spaceship right now?
I think so.

Okay.
Hey.

What?

- What is wrong with you?

There's something here.
Whoa!
- Ah!

Whoa.
What's going on?
- The stairs!

There's no way out.
- Guys, guys, guys!

- I'm going!

Come on, come on.
Didi, I'm coming!
You're real!
Leave her alone!
We will kill you.
Kill me?

There's five of us.
Yes, I know!

Wait, where's the other guy?

Oh, no, no, no!
All of you.
In a spaceship buried underground?

- What's today?

Then 65 million years.
I've been very lonely.
You're all so young-looking.
This has to do with the coins?
Yes, yes, the coins!
Different colors.

Different-colored kids!
I'm so excited you're here!
Turn around.
Go on.
No way.
Proceed.
Think this'll work.
One, two, three, four, five.

Guys, let's focus on getting out of here.
Stay together, and then when we see a chance...
- We run like hell.

Then we kill it.
Shouldn't hurt, but let's see.
Please, step into the footprints.
No.

Hey, question.

I'm Alpha 5, an alphormic lorcaid persona android.
- What?

I'm a talking robot.

Billy!
What the hell?
Okay.
Why do you keep looking at each other?
Is that, like, a human thing?
Fascinating.
Oh, it's working!

Zordon, are you there?

Okay.

Come on!

Go, go, go!
Come forward, please!
Do we have a choice?
Don't think so.
Look!

What?
Zordon, they don't know who you are.
Come in!

These are them?

Funny, I said the same thing, actually.
You mean to tell me that the fate of the universe is placed in the hands of these... these children?
The universe?

They're teenagers.
Somewhere between infancy and full maturity.
- It's hard to explain, really.

The morphing grid is never wrong.
If the power coins have returned to the ship with these...
Teenagers!
With these teenagers, then these teenagers are the Power Rangers.
Power Rangers!
What?
Okay, quick question.
Hello.

Did I just hear you say we're Power Rangers?
Yes.

Any other questions?
- No, I think I'm good.

I got a question.

Oh, okay... um, my name is Billy.

- Kids used to call me Billy Crams-tons...

I'm sorry.

Looks like the Power Rangers were a team that protected life.
And life is a bright light.

Yes.

It is called the Zeo Crystal.
Oh, I love this part.

And every planet in the universe that has life has a piece of the crystal buried inside it.
Sixty-five million years ago,
Zordon's team died defending the crystal here in what is now Angel Grove.
- The coins have chosen you five.

Now you must protect the Zeo Crystal and life on earth.
Because... we...

He's smart!
I'm sorry, um, is this some kind of joke?
Like, I'm standing here with a wet wedgie.
My socks are soaked.

We're talking to a wall.

Silence!
Dig!

Sir, I'm detecting elevated heart rates.
They're...

I don't understand.
Why would you show us that nightmare?
It's not a nightmare.

- Was that for real?

- And who was that woman?

She will create Goldar, a huge monster who will rip the crystal from the earth, and all life on your planet will die.
With the crystal, Rita will have the power to create and destroy worlds.
So, let me guess.
You want us to kill this woman?

Ay, ay, ay!

She must be stopped.
When is she coming?
She's already here.
My best guess is we have 11 months.
Oh, I'm sorry, days.

If we're the Power Rangers and this is our ship, if I walk through that door right now, will it open for me?
Yes, of course.
Let's go.
Whoa, what you doing?
No, no, no, come back!

Jason, my ranger team died defending the crystal from Rita.
That's why I'm in this wall.
How'd you know my name?
Because it's you, Jason Scott.
You are the leader.

Rita was a ranger, too.

But she betrayed us.
Wanted more power.
She lost her way.
Now she is just pure evil.
You must bring them back.

You must train your team to stop Rita before she has the strength to find the crystal.
Okay.

- And I only speak for myself when I...

You know that, deep down, what I'm saying is true.
You were born for this.
You all waited.
Even you.
Who... exactly are you?
Really?

- Look, her name is Didi.

She's new at school.

We have English together, right?
I've been at Angel Grove for over a year now.
We have biology together.

Wait, look... none of us really know each other, okay?
But somehow... we were all in the same place at the same time when Billy found those coins.
- And...

Are we really superheroes?
Like are we more like Iron Man or Spider-Man?
'Cause I feel like I been bit by a spider, but I feel really good, you know, not as...
All right, look, bro, trust me, you're not a superhero.
Why are you talking to us like you're the boss now?
Hey, hold up.

Can any of it be true?
I don't know.
But I know that the answer to what's wrong with us and to what's happening to us... is here.
So what are you saying?
I think we gotta come back.
I can't make you come back here.
But 4:00 tomorrow...

Hey, Jason, we don't... we don't...
That makes sense.

Of course.
I don't know why I didn't think about that one in the first place.
So where were you today?
Were you with friends?

- Why are you so tired...

You ask her four questions before she's even answered the first.
Because she's like a ghost around here.

- June...

- Speak!

Okay.

Okay, Trini, let's start over.
Please tell us one thing you did today.
Me and four kids from Angel Grove found a spaceship buried underground.
What?
I'm pretty sure I'm a superhero.
Cool.
Not cool.
Pee in that cup!
This to remind me of my screw-up?
No.

Figure I'd leave it up to you to decide if you wanted to fix it.
Oh, shit.
Mr. Scott, there's been an incident on your boat.
It's a terrible situation.

A series of grisly crime scenes has the sleepy fishing hamlet of Angel Grove reeling.
- Bodies were discovered...

This rash of violence has the town on edge.
Goldar's coming.

Goldar's coming.

What the hell you doing?
I need gold.

Goldar takes the Zeo Crystal.

Me, too!
- What's up, crazy girl?

Shall we do this?
You need to follow the three rules to being a Power Ranger.
You must never use your powers for personal gain.
You must never escalate a fight, unless your enemy forces you to.
And you must never reveal your identity.

To assume your ranger identities, you need to morph.
Have any of you morphed before?
Yes.

Okay, okay.

Let's try this.
Standing in this circle as a team, you can easily connect to the morphing grid.
- Do you feel it?

No.

You need to morph to get your armor.
I knew it!

Jason!

Cool.

You already have it inside of you.
You bring it out by connecting to each other and connecting to the morphing grid.
Clear your minds and focus.
Power Rangers were a legion of warriors sworn to protect life.
Yes!
You must become those warriors.
Become the warriors!
What?
What?

Alpha 5, why didn't they morph?
Yeah, I don't...

Very disturbing.

We don't have time.
If they can't morph, what are we supposed to do?
They'll have to train without armor.
- They need to prepare.

Sir, that'll be very painful.
Take them down to the pit.
All right, follow me.

Jason, I don't wanna find out what the pit is.
So this is the pit.

Alpha 5, begin the exercise.
Uh... sorry, guys.
- What exercise?

These creatures before you are a simulation of Rita's army.
They're called Putties.
You must get through them to get to her.
No, no, no, no, Jason.
Cool.

Like a video game.

Whoa!
That's a strong-ass hologram.
Not a video game.
This is why you must morph into your armor.
If Rita becomes strong enough to build her army, it'll be the beginning of the end.
Rangers, welcome to training.
I'm so excited you guys are back.
Aim for the center mass.
One more time.
Come on, duck the punches.

Oh...
Let's go a couple o' hits, okay?

No, let's try it again.
Now this is exciting.
Yeah, Trini!
Hai!
Ready, master Billy?
You need to learn the element of surprise.
Ready?

All right, Billy, lighter on your feet.
Hands up.
Play with some energy now!

Focus!

Lucky shot.
You guys all know you could be murdered, right'?
No.
You must shed your masks to wear this armor.
I don't feel anything.
Take them down to the pit.
Now watch me... slip, grab, lift.
Yeah!
Slip, grab, lift!
Yes!
Think only of each other, and the morphing grid will open to you.
Is it working?
No, it's not.
Come on!

Let's just concentrate.
I've been concentrating though, Jason.
'Cause we haven't been concentrating... all we need to do is just concentrate.
Don't tell me to concentrate.
Just follow my lead.
Let's not fight with each other.
Zack, now is not the time.
Come on.

The information we need to triangulate the location of the crystal was lost in the battle.

Billy, are you listening to me?
Billy, what are you doing?
Billy!
Where's the crystal?

Where's the crystal?
There.
One, two...

Hey, idiot, watch where you're going!
- One, two, three...

Two fishermen were laid to rest today at Saint Andrew's Cemetery.
Residents of Angel Grove are feeling the shock.
Fear has the town on edge.
This series of murders has police baffled as police have linked the loss of gold to each crime scene.
What is now being dubbed "Angel Grove's Gold Killer"
is still on the loose.
...Rita manages to create Goldar...

And he rips the crystal from the ground, it'll be like 10,000 nuclear bombs washing over Earth.
Supposed to freak us out?
You keep making this harder.

Feel free to throw us a bone at some point.
Yes, I see you busting your "asses."
So I've decided to give you some inspiration.
What you will find beyond this wall will forever change your lives.
Come on.
The Zords!
- Pretty cool, right'?

They take on the form of the most powerful organism on the planet.
When these Zords formed, dinosaurs reigned supreme.
They will be an extension of you.
And their power... is all but limitless.
But you're not ready for this power.
When you morph, your armor will make you one with the Zords.
So come on, let's go train.
Today's the day you become rangers!

- Okay.

Yeah.

This was a bad idea.
Okay, okay, uh, signals, brakes.
Brakes, I need brakes!
Manual.

Where are the brakes...

Ahh!

Hey!

Out of the way!
♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪
You have to remember that in today's training lesson the important thing is to...
- Wait.

Run, run, run!

Run!

It's bad!
You all right?
Ay, ay, ay!
All right, my bad, my bad.

What's your problem?
You could've killed yourself.

- Back off, bossman.

Oh, come on, guys.

- Guys, guys, guys, come on!

Wait.

Just stop fighting, please!
What?
That's dope.
What?

- Yeah!

Okay, now that's cool!

- Hold still.

Zack, do not touch it.
Whoa!
Where'd it go?

Bring it back, dude.
Get out.
Training is over for today.

I'm sorry, he just morphed.
He did it.

Do it again.
All of you.

- Billy.

- Show us what you did.

- Do it again!

Billy, how'd you do it?

Okay, we don't know how.
That's what I thought.
If you can't morph, you are not rangers.
Go home.

Now what?
Damn.
Seriously?
Hey, guys... guys, look, uh...

Make a fire.

I'm down.
All right.

Jason's team is failing.

There must be a way to free me from this wall.
Yes, but the irony is, is that you need these rangers to morph.
If they morph, you can harness that energy to regenerate your body and come back through.
There's got to be another way!

What, Zordon?

Wait for us dumb kids to morph so that you can come back to life?
That's what all this has been about, right?
You coming back?
This has only ever been about protecting the crystal.
Rita could be building Goldar as we speak.
- Don't underestimate me or my team.

She will have him dig up the crystal and life on earth will die.
And we need you.
Because you were so successful at stopping her last time.
I died burying those coins in hopes that they would find the next real rangers.
Those who are worthy.
Well, sorry to disappoint you.
I don't need to stand here and have you tell me what I did wrong.
- I can go home and get that.

To help lead this team!
Your team's dead.
And you're just as scared as we are.
These... are all 24 karat gold bands.
Hello, I'll be right with you.
They're at the top of your budget...
I'll get you anything you want.
Aw.

Get my cookie anything she wants.
I'll be right back.
Uh... can I help you?
Gold.
I'm interested... in gold.
Yeah.
We have some very nice pieces here.
Come closer.
- Closer.

- This.

Okay.

Ah...
Grow.
Grow.
More!
Police!

Drop your... weapon, and put your hands on your head.
Do it now!
Do what I say, lady!
Lady...

Get on the ground and you won't get hurt.
Unit five, I need backup at Fenix Jewelers.
Shots fired.

Get down!
It's been too long since I raised my beautiful creatures.
Did you miss me?
Oh, my God.
Kill him!
All right.
If I weren't stuck in this wall,
I would eat that junk food!
What happened back there?
Nothing.

Billy, how'd you do it?
How'd you morph?
I don't know.
What are you guys thinking about when we're trying to morph?
You must shed your masks to wear this armor.
Think only of each other and the morphing grid will open to you.
Yeah, that's better.
Well, maybe it's because we don't know each other.
Maybe that's why we can't morph.
Okay.
No, I'm serious.

- What?

And I am a Power Ranger.
Hi, Zack.
Truth:

It's just me and my mom.
And my mom?
My mom is the best!
But my mom, she's sick.
I do what I can, but... but I'm scared.
Sometimes I get too scared to stay there at night, 'cause... 'cause I'm afraid she can't make it.
And if she goes... when she goes,
I got nobody else.
Look, I think being with you guys is good for me.
Let's do that.
Let's tell our secrets.

Okay, I got a secret.
- I like country music.

No, matter of fact, I love country music.
And I don't...
I don't miss my dad as much.
I mean, coming to the mine with him was all I had.
But coming to the mine with you guys is just as good.
Yeah.
Bigger secret is why were you in detention?
- I blew up my lunchbox.

What, it was a accident, okay?
- Of course.

Boom goes the lunchbox, in detention goes Billy.
But let's not forget that Kimberly Hart was also in... in detention, too, so...
Not tonight.
Skip me.
What about you, dude?
Why don't you tell us who you really are?
Because everyone knows exactly who I am.
Okay.
What about you, crazy girl?
I could tell you anything and you'd have to believe me.
Okay, um...
I'm the new girl.

Three schools in three years.
What's crazy is I like it that way.

Nobody ever has to get to know me and uh, my parents don't have to worry about my relationships.
Boyfriend troubles?
Yeah.

Girlfriend troubles?
My family is so normal.
Too normal.
They believe in labels.
They'd like for me to, um...

Talk more.
Have the kind of friends they want me to have.
It's just...

And I've never said any of this out loud.
Well, it's cool.

Am I?
What does that mean?
When all this is over.
Are we Power Rangers or... are we friends?
Do you know who I am?
Yes.
I was once just like you.
So pretty.
Innocent
Are all the rangers on Zordon's new team as young as you?
Delightful!
Have you morphed yet?
Trick question.
If you could morph, we'd be having a very different conversation.
Mmm.

Should I kill you?
I killed the Yellow Ranger... before.
And I loved it!
Oh, you want your armor.
I'll show you mine, if you show me yours.
No, please, you're hurting me!

I'm just kidding.
You've got spunk, little Yellow.
I see myself in you.
I was an outsider on Zordon's team just like you.
All I need to know is, where is the Zeo Crystal?
I don't know.
Sadly, I believe you.
Tomorrow, I am going to destroy Angel Grove.
But, in exchange for your life, you will find out where that crystal is, and you will come to me.
We can have a little deal,
Didi, my friend.
- Shh!

How did you get in here?
I'm a superhero.

Is everything okay?
I think I'm the reason we can't morph.
I haven't really been honest.
Okay.

And he was right.
Well, that can't be true.
Okay.
Whoa.
- You took that picture?

Amanda Clark took that picture.

But she shared it with me.

And you sent that pic to... to Ty?
With a text that said,
"Is this the girl you wanna bring home to your mom?"
Oh.
I didn't realize how mean it was until I saw her face.
Kim, there's literally thousands of photos going around school.
I don't care about them.

I had to sit in Mr. Detmer's office with Amanda's father and watch as they showed him that photo of his daughter.
In his eyes, for the first time, I could see who I'd become.
You know, so I lied.

I wanted to die, that's why... that's why when you asked me to run away, I was ready.
Okay, listen.

- Jason, it can't be erased.

You did an awful thing.

Just be the person you wanna be.
So, we all got the same text.

I'm here.
Look, Rita came to my house tonight.
- What?

She nearly killed me.
She was trying to get me to join her.
She said she'd spare my life, if I could keep a secret.
What secret?
At dawn, the destruction of Angel Grove begins.
This is real.

No, it's not.

She said to meet her where the dead ships live.
Okay.

- Let's go.

Are you serious?

Jason, we're not even Power Rangers yet.
I say we go back to Zordon.
Okay, the only reason Zordon wanted us to become Power Rangers is so that he can come back to life.
What makes you say that?
Because he told me.
Wait, so this all is a lie?
Of course it was a lie, Billy.
We failed.
Let's stop being delusional about being a team of superheroes.
We're all screw-ups.
And as much as I hate this scrubby, bullshit town,
I don't wanna just sit around and watch it die, okay?
Let's go and do the one thing that's been asked of us and kill Rita.
You know this is a really bad idea, right?
The worst.
Let's vote.

Let's do it.
Okay.

Take the left, I'll take the right.
Okay.

- We'll, untie him.

Let's just think about this, okay?
Oh, shit!
Right on time.
I was beginning to think you were too dumb to know where the dead ships live.
Let's play.
Five little rangers tied up like fish.
The leader?

Oh!
You're not entirely disappointing.
Oh, look at you.

I'll just tell you.
Yellow has led you to your deaths.
Because I'm going to kill you, one by one, until you tell me, where is my crystal?
We don't know.
No, Red.

But guess what?
One of you does.
Who could it be?
Eenie, meenie, miney...
Blue.
Blue, so loyal.
Pure of heart.
Tell the class what you know!
Where's my crystal?
You can tell me now, Blue, or you can tell me after I kill all of your friends.
Let's start with Black.
No!

No.
He dies in three, two...
Okay!

Don't hurt my friends, all right?
It's at a dining establishment.
Where?

It's a Krispy Kreme.
- Krispy Kreme?

This is a special place?
- Very special.

The source of life itself is buried there.
Thank you, Blue, for being so weak.
Zordon would lose all respect for me if I don't kill you.
- At least one of you.

No!

- Billy!

- Jason, we gotta help him!

You're not ready to kill me.
Ha!

Quick!

Billy!
Billy?
He's gonna be okay, right?
Come on.
Hey, hey.

He's dead.
He's dead.
No.
Pick him up.
Help me pick him up!
Come on!
Okay.

Take him.

Yeah.
- Let's just put him down.

- Slow, slow, slow.

Do something, okay?
There must be something you can do for him.
I told you that you were not ready.
Zordon, please help us, okay?

There's nothing that I could do for him.
We were both reckless with our teams.
No.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, guys.
He's dead because of me.
No, Jason, it was all of us.
No, I pushed it.
And as usual I made the wrong decision.
Out of... out of fear, anger...
I don't know, I was just so angry.
He's... he's a great kid, you know?
And he loved us.
He loved... being a ranger.
I'm sorry, Billy.
I'd trade my life for yours if I could.
Maybe he traded his life for us.
Yeah.

I would.
Me too.
Yeah.

Me too.
It's just the four of us now.
The truth is, whatever we've said to each other, it doesn't matter.
This.

She's right.
Zordon!

This is your time!

The grid is open!

Yes, I see it.

Step through, Zordon!
- Hey!

The morphing grid is open!
What's going on?
Zordon?

Where is he?
He must have stepped through the grid.
Alpha, where'd he go?
I don't know where he is.
Zordon, what?

That was your only chance.
I know.
But only one can come back.
Billy!
- Billy!

Are you okay?
- Did I die?

- No.

And you guys brought me back to life.
I told you we were superheroes.
There can only be one Red Ranger.
Jason, this is your time.
This is your team.
Thank you.
Dude.

Seein' my dad.
Welcome back, my friend.
- Oh, we gotta go to Krispy Kreme, Jason.

Not for donuts.
Okay.

Thank you, Zordon.
It's morphin' time.
Who is that?
Oh, my God!
Yes.
Come back to me, Goldar.
Come back.
Hold up.

All right.

Yes!
Yee-haw!
Whoa, this is so much better with armor.
Come on!

Hey, heads up!
Guys, they just keep coming.
There's too many of them.
You guys hold them off.
Zack, where are you going?
Whoo-hoo!
Make my monster grow!
I've missed you, my friend.
They're gonna push us off the edge!
Incoming!
Let's kill everyone.
Did you guys see that?
All right, who wants me to pimp their ride, too?
Uh, guys?

Oh, man.
That's... that's a lotta gold.
We're gonna protect the crystal, right?
- We're going to Angel Grove.

This is a lot different than the van.
Whoo!
Yippie-kay-yay, motherfu...
Mother's good.

Go, go, Power Rangers!
I'm not going the right way!

Jason, I'm going backwards.
Guys... our town.

Krispy Kreme!
Not there.
Rita and her golden boy haven't found Krispy Kreme yet.
Okay, Kim, you hold them there.
Zack, Billy, you circle the Krispy Kreme and make sure it's safe.
I'm headed straight for Goldar.
Copy!

Kim, I'll go with you.
Let's go, boys.
Billy, just the two of us.
I'm right behind you.
Oops.
Surprise.
How cute.
The rangers found their costumes and their dino-cars.
Well, let's give them something else to play with.
Crush them!
How many does she need?
This is insane.
Take that!
Okay.

Sorry, Bumblebee!

Yeah!
I can't get 'em off!
Turn your head.

Okay.

That's all right.
That's what you get.
Whoo!
The crystal.
She just found the crystal.
Okay, come on, let's move!
I'll take Goldar from the right.
J!

Come on!
Jason, it's your dad.
I'm looking for you.

I'm at Mariner Bay and Reefside.
Call me back soon as you get this.
How's that feel?
We got this.

- No!

I'm coming!
Ahh!
Help!
Give me your hand.
Help!
- Sam!

It's okay.
Give me your hand.
Dig.

Me and Zack are gonna try to push Goldar to the water.
We're okay.

Guys, help!
Billy, I have an idea.

Uh...

Oh-ho-ho!
I don't know what to press, okay?
Open wide, Rita.
Let me try...
Hey, Billy, you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
That was crazy brave, dude.
Did we do it?
Did we... did we win?
Yeah!
I feel the crystal.
She's back.
That's incredible.
Oh, my God.
Come on, let's go!
Okay, everyone.
Hold the line.
Okay.
We got this.
Come on!
Crush them!
Okay, fire!
Yeah!
Come on, guys!
Ohh!
If you must come at me...

Watch out!

Okay.
Yes!
Jason, I'm coming in.
Kim!

I got you.
I'm burning.
I can't...

He's crushing me!
Push them into the pit!
Guys, we're sliding!
- Come on, everybody, hold the line!

It's getting too hot, guys.
I don't know how much longer I can hold it.
No one dies alone.
I'm okay with that.
Hold the line.

Hold the line.
Zack!

Thank you for being my friends.
Hold on to each other.
Get my crystal!
We're alive.
Guys, we're alive!
We're like one big, uh... one big Zord.

- What?

How?
Whoa.
What?
Oh, shit.
Bring it on.
Everyone, let's go!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no!
That might have been my fault.

I think Kimberly needs to move our feet.
- No, I've got the arm.

- You're a leg, too?

We all have to move together.
I'll lift us.
All together on three.
One, two, three!
We got this!

Zack, catch us.
Let's go again!
Kimberly, throw a hook!

Whoo!
Oh, I wish I could punch.
Nice one, Billy!
Jason, we got anything for that?
Remember the pit?
Yeah.
Hey, I hate the pit!
- Ready?

- Ready.

Ready.
Now!
Slip!
Grab!
Lift!
Kim, Trini, pull back on the arms.
We've got swords.
Ha!
Wait!
Guys...
Look at me.
You think you've won?
I came for the crystal.
Others will come!
What you have... it can't last.
You know I'm right!
- No.

I don't know.

I need you to give your staff and your coin to us.
And we'll take you to Zordon and let him be the judge.
Zordon?

Never!
No matter what Zordon says,
I know I am worthy!
Trini!

Jason, did you just slap her?
I did.

That's cool.
I guess the bully... you guys don't get...

Oh, that was scary.
We did it.
I told you we'd be famous.
Is that Principal Feig?
Hey.

Oh, let's wiggle, Jason.
I call this the algebra.

How do you even do that?
You should keep that.
You've earned it.
I'll come back for it.
That was terrifying.

Jeremy Franklin told everyone at school.
The blue was the best one.

Hey, no, I wanna be the blue one!
I wanna be blue one.
Hey, how about one of you guys try to be the yellow one?
Oh, yeah, the yellow one!

How do you know it's a he?
Checkmate.
Billy!

Mom, it's Trini!

This ranger team did what my team could not.
You will humbly walk amongst your peers, but heroes you all will be.
- Attention!

I will always owe a debt of gratitude to you all.
Oh, we have a new detention student.
"Tommy Oliver."
Tommy Oliver?
Tommy Oliver!
Tommy Oliver?
Tommy Oliver!
Cranston.
That might have been my fault.
That might have been my fault, I'm so sorry.
