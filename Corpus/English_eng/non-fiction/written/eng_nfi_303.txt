Great news!

What couch problem?
Uh, the one that's got your knees up higher than when you're getting a pap smear.
So, Logan's remodeling her condo, and she's giving me her old couch!
Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god...
- Help me up so I can be excited.

Both:

- And the best part is...

It's a-comin a-right a-now!
- Oh my god, do you love it?

What?

It's hideous.
It looks like the product of years of couch incest.
It's a-goin' a-back a-now!
It's not going anywhere.
Do you understand that Logan is my boss?
What if she comes over and the couch isn't here?
What if anyone else comes over and the couch is here?
Gabi...

Sending it back would be a slap in her face.
But I don't want it!
Well, (scoffs) I mean, I don't wanna be an assistant my entire life.
And when it comes time for a promotion, who do you think'll get it?

So you really think that... this couch is, uh... gonna get you a promotion?

Oh, Gabi, that's exactly how it works.
Before this, Logan and I had nothing in common.
Now we have the couch.
So, whenever we're alone, or in the bathroom, or there's a lull in conversation, she'll be like,
"How's the couch?"
And I'll be like, "Oh, my god!

And she'll be like, "I knew you would.

And that, my friend, is how it works.
Okay, if it's that important to you, I guess we'll keep the couch, but just know that I hate it!
Thank you!
And one more thing, and you might not be interested in this, but, um... there is a matching ottoman.

Okay... what's goin' on in here?
I'm makin' freakin' fudge.
Well, why make fudge when you could have this white chocolate?
Ugh!
Come on, we haven't used the punch card in a week.
Which means I...

All right, here's something that'll... keep you from thinkin' about sex.
Ooof.

What is that?
That's a couch.
Digesting another couch?
Sofia's boss dumped her crappy couch on us.
Oh!

I just developed this new app for called "Crap4Cash."
Hey... that's great,
I have a ton of crap and I need a ton of cash.
Everyone does, Gabi.
But what does everybody hate?
Meeting the creep who bought your crap.
That's why I developed an anonymous delivery service that shows up so you don't have to meet the creep... who bought your crap.
My god!

Give me your phone, I'll put your couch on there.
No...

Well, you don't have to accept any bids.
I'll just show you how it works, give me your phone.
Oh... fudge!
What...

Today is our first weigh-in at Fat Fighters.
Yeah, well, we're not there yet.
So, let me get this straight, you're taking the thing with the most fat in it to a diet center?
No, I'm also taking Yolanda.
(cash register sound)
What was that?
That's the sound the app makes when someone bids on your crap.
Someone just offered you 500.
Dollars?
Oh my god, that's with the photo?
- (cash register sound) - 650!
My god, are you kidding me?

- (cash register sound)

Sold!
Oh my god... that's the rabbi from your wedding!
Oh, Rabbi Shapiro.
Let's go say hi.
Oh...

Uh...

You slept with him?
Haven't the Jews suffered enough?
Shut up!

I have no idea what happened.
I do.

(indistinct) I'm outta here.
Oh, really?

Damn right I don't.
Although he does look cute in that rabbi sweater.
Hello, everybody.

I went from wandering around the desert to wondering, "Where's dessert?"
He still makes me laugh.
Today's topic... emotions.
Instead of eating our feelings, we have to learn to express it.

Why the hell you stop calling me?
Yolanda?
How are you?
Hey!

Fatty says what?
That's like 20 points!
Oh!

Want some, honey?
Oh my god!
Do you know how long I've been looking for a fat-free dessert that actually tastes good?
Judging from your Cosby sweater, I'd say since the '90s.
Where did get this?

Well, you would have to.

Name your price, my husband's rich.
You're married?
I had to break it off because there was no future.
Being with a non-Jewish woman would break my mother's heart.
But you know what?

Your only limit... is your soul.
Was that Gandhi?
Ratatouille.
Oh, Sofia!
I have a huge surprise.
- Me, too!

Logan's coming over for dinner to see the couch!
What?
Yeah.
So get this, we were in the bathroom, and for the first time ever, there were no uncomfortable silences.
Why?

And I was like, "Do you wanna come over and see the couch?"
And she was all, "Sure, I'd love to."
And... so now, she's coming over for dinner with me and the couch, which means the promotion can't be far off.
What's your surprise?
Gabi, where's the couch?
S...

Uh... where's the couch?
Um...

You sold the couch?
I didn't mean to.
Well, get it back!
That might not be exactly possible, because I sold it on Josh's new app, "Crap4Cash,"
where everything you sell is anonymous.

I cannot believe you,
I told you that this was my ticket in!
Into what?
Into... a promotion!
Do you listen to anything I say?
Like... do you even know that I wanna be a writer?
I do now.
Oh my god!

Why am I even friends with you?
I don't understand why you're getting so mad, I do bad stuff all the time!
This isn't... it's... this isn't like any other time, Gabi, this is about my career!
As a writer!
Gabi, I told you how important this was to me and... and... now I may never get a promotion, and not only that, come Monday,
I might not even have a job.
Sofia, I'm really sorry.
Oh my god, Gabi, you are always sorry.
You're always sorry.
How many more times are you gonna be sorry?
One more.
That was rhetorical.
Rhetorical.

I'm done.
We can still get the ottoman!
Ohhh... you know, I never thought I'd be on a date at a Fat Fighters clinic.
Well, I was gonna take you to a nice restaurant, but I know how difficult it is to dine out when you start a new program.
Ohhh... and who knew you were such an amazing cook.
(both laugh)

(both laugh)
Thank you.
So how'd you end up workin' here anyway?
Well, about a month ago, I was napping on my mom's couch, and it sorta kinda broke under my weight.
Oh, well, you won't break me, baby.
Promise?
(phone ringing)
Oh.

- (phone ringing)

Yeah, I'm gonna send that to voice-mail.
Come here.
- Oh.

Maybe I should call her back.
No.

- No.

No, not even a text.
Ugh...

You got that right.
You know what?

No... screw this Yolanda.
Oh, I intend to.
But first I have to tell you something.
Those two months we spent together were amazing.
I let you go once.

I'm gonna tell my mother about us.
You would risk your relationship with your mom for me?
As the saying goes,
"Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing."
Old Testament?
Fight Club.
(elevator dings)
Hey, Yolanda.
I'm so glad you're here.

Sure, baby.

(laughs) You think I can impress my boyfriend's mama in this outfit?
Uh...

You wanna tell me why I'm doin' this?
I'm tryin' to find out where the Cash4Crap anonymous warehouse is so I can save my relationship with Sofia.
Okay.

(elevator dings)
You got the stuff?
Oh, I got the stuff.

Do I smell fudge?
100 percent pure brown gold.

I...

- They're fat free.

Son of a bitch!
Devon!

Screw Fat Fighters.

(phone ringing)
Hey!

It was here last night.
Now it's gone, and there's a post-it note that says, "Thanks.

Well...

Where are you?
Here's the thing...

What?

Nobody wants anything I own!
I'm sorry, I...

Are you following the delivery truck?
Not exactly.
Well, if you're not following the truck, how do you know where the...
You're sitting in the chair in a box in the back of the truck, aren't you?
I had to do it, Josh.

(truck gate opening)
Shoot, someone's coming!

Hey, guys?

Asked the chair...
Okay.

She loves chocolate.
Let's hope so.
(knocking on door)
Gabi?
Rabbi Shapiro?
Is your first name...

Gabi.

Yeah, that's why I'm here.

Oh, girl, I could've just driven you here.
Now!

Oh.
What are you doing here?
Oh, this is Ben's mother's apartment, and we're about to tell her we're dating.
Oh, that's so cute, I didn't know you guys were...
Oh my god, my couch!
She's here!
- Benny!

Your girlfriend is gorgeous!
No...

Oh... no... oh, Mrs. Shapiro...
A little young... but gorgeous.
Oh, uh, Mrs. Shapiro, I'm actually...
And look at that tuchus.
Sometimes God gives with two hands.
- Ma...

- Can I have your couch?

Oh!
Benny!

You made me the happiest woman on Earth!
Are you gonna tell your mother I'm your girlfriend or not?
I've never seen her so happy!
Are you kidding me?
All right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
This time it's gonna require a little Schnapps.
I...

- For me!

I'm so happy to see you.
Oh, you think you're happy.
Benny never brought home a girl before.
And so blonde and beautiful.
I'd never know you're Jewish.
You are...

Yes!

Ma, I got somethin' to tell ya.
That girl that you're talking to...
Is an angel!
She's not my girlfriend.
- What?

Then who the hell's this?
I'm...

Oy!

Well...

Benny, if... if you're happy, then I'm happy.
Ma, I've never been happier.
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you, Yo-lan-da?
Oh... oh... the pleasure's mine.
I never met an African-American Jew.
Are you from the lost tribe of...?

Uh... uh... it's... uh... uh...
More like the lost tribe of Inglewood.
I'm, uh...

- What?

- I love her.

Ma, Ma!
Mrs. Shapiro!
Ma...

I can't breathe!
- All right, come on, Ma.

Oh, for the love of Jesus!
Oh, don't say Jesus!
- All right...

Slow down, Ma.
Just don't worry.
Oh my god.
Hello, old friend.
It's a mitzvah!
Don't think I brought you back 'cause I like you, okay?
'Cause I don't...

(key in door) Oh, my god, she's here.

So-fi-a...
Hi.
Okay, you're not gonna be mad at me in a minute, because I have a huge surprise for you.
Yeah, well, I kinda have one for you, too.
Okay, mine's more of a visual, so let's...
No, um... tryin' to be a better listener, so, um... you go first.
Well, Logan's not coming over to see the couch.
What?
Yeah, it turned out that giving me that couch was just a mean joke she and her rich friends play on their assistants.

So... what's your surprise?
Ohh.
Oh... well... so I guess it wasn't that hard to get back after all.
Nope.

I just had to...

and willing to make babies with her son.
So I told her I was Jewish, and then she fainted, which gave me the opportunity to steal the couch back for my best friend, who I love more than anything else in the world.
So, uh... you kn... now's where you hug me, and you say you love me, and, uh, it's all, you know, water under the couch...
Yeah, well... it's not.
It's not?

Because that's not the problem.
The problem is that you don't respect me, and you don't listen to me, and you don't care about how important my career is to me.
Oh... well, uh, guess, uh, just, uh, nothin', uh, nothin' more to say, then.
What's that?
Nothing.

"Intro to Journalism"?
Uh, I...

What?
Yeah, because you're a writer!

And if...

Gabi, it...

That's why I got you the class!
And... you know what I realized?
I mean, this whole time, I wasn't trying to get the couch back,
I was trying to get you back, you know?

- And you're my ugly couch!

Oy, this fakakta couch alread.
So, we waited at the hospital for hours.
And when she finally came to, she forbid Ben from seein' me.
But, the good news is, right after that, she fell into a coma.
That's horrible.
Not for my sex life.
As long as she's out...

What you need, bro?
I need a fix... got a dime bag?
Careful with that... it's uncut.
I gained six pounds?
So... all of us gained weight.
How is that even possible?
We've been exercising, counting points... the only outside food that I've eaten is...
Oh, my god!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up!
Before you do anything... consider this... is anyone really gonna notice that you gained six pounds?
Oh!
