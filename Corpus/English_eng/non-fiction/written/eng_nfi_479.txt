We are transporting 11 million sticks of dynamite, 17000 pounds of C4,
About 150 cute little plastic bomb type bombs, and 2 best friends!
And request permission to fly over the most crime-ridden city in the world, over.
I'm just looking at all the guys faces here in the control tower.

Yep, I think we're cool with that.
Gentlemen, breach in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

Holy cow!

I'm afraid Captain Dale had to bail.
I'm your new co-pilot, and I always come to work with a smile.
- You should be terrified.

Because I will be taking over the city.

- He always stops you.

- What about that time with the 2 boats?

Well tonight is gonna be different!

Trust me, Batman's never gonna see it coming.

- Like the time with the parade and the Prince music?

- Night, Steve.

It's Egghead, Sir, I'm well aware of his work.
Dear gosh, you destroyed the Bat-Signal!

Yeah, I know, and when I take over Gotham City...

Batman will grovel at the feet of his greatest enemy.
Me.

- We're ready for you, sugar plum.

Fire in the hole!

I love it.

Nobody calls you that.
- No, people do call me that.

At this very moment, an unnecessarily complicated bomb is being attached to the inside of the main energy core, if the Mayor isn't here in 5 minutes to negotiate the city's surrender, then I shall destroy Gotham City.
I did something!
Doctor, that sounds frightening.

Well, I don't wanna scare any small children who may be listening but it's a little-known fact that Gotham City is built on a bunch of flimsy plates stuck together.
There's literally nothing beneath us, except an infinite abyss that smells like dirty underwear.
If Joker's bomb were to go off, these plates would break apart, plunging every Gotham citizen into the eternal abyss forever.
And you wouldn't want that now, would you?
Now get me the Mayor!

Madam Mayor, I cannot ask you to do this!

Then we have no choice.

We have to surrender Gotham City.

Alright kid, we need to avoid Commissioner Gordan.

So, lesson number 3.
When going stealth, you gotta hide every part of you.
Physically, and emotionally.
- Got it?

Already failed.
What I need you to do is, use the naturally dark areas of your costume and integrate into the dark parts of this environment.
Okay.
- Can you see me?

- What about now?

- What about now?

- Now?

- Batman!

[♪ I JUST DIED IN YOUR ARMS TONIGHT]
- Batman?

- Who's this?

- Is that your son?

- No, that's just weird.

Right.

I could have a kid.

And... she was just standing right in front of me... and we looked at each other, and thought, hey, let's do this.
Let's be together.
- Batman...

I hope you're back because you decided to work together
- on the Joker case?

Great!
Ooh, Arkham Asylum.
So before we question the Joker, I'm gonna need you to hand over all your weapons.
I mean, I don't know if I have anything...
- Oh, I just got a couple here.

- Oh, of course.

There we go.
Uh, this is really uncomfortable.
Sorry, my shoes are part of my pants.
Oops...
- Batman...

Why is your not son trying to smuggle the Phantom Zone Projector into Arkham?
What?

- Batman, give me the Phantom Zone Projector.

- Batman, give me the-

No, no, no... whoa, nice.
I studied Brazilian Jujitsu at Harvard for Police!
Oh yeah, well guess who got a PhD in smoke bombs?
- Dr. Batman!

- Freeze, Batman!

These guys are my bros.
- Go ahead and take a couple of them out.

What's up, Joker?
- Namaste, Batman.

- Gross.

- Cut the baloney.

Looks like you're going to a lot of trouble for little old me.
I must be your greatest enemy after all.
Right, Batman?
- I see what you're trying to do.

You're trying to entrap me into a relationship.
- Really?

Oh yes it is.

- No you're not.

I knew you'd say that.
- No you didn't!

And I knew you'd say that!
See?

- It's you and I!

- Admit it...

- Okay, then send me to the Phantom Zone.

And prove I'm your greatest enemy.
Batman, don't do this!
As long as you're in the Phantom Zone, I'll be saving Gotham City.
And that's all that matters to me.
- Goodbye, Joker.

Yes!

Batman, what are you doing!

I'm Batman...ing.
♪ I'm Batman.

♪ I got a 9 pack]

- Batman, I can't believe you did this.

And even worse, you've made this kid into an accessory to your crime.

That's okay Ma'am, as long as I'm doing the dime in the big house with my old man, eveything's gonna be a-okay.
Officers, take this projector to the evidence room.
- And get this man some pants!

P-Co, why has nobody fist-bumped me yet?
You know...
When I was a kid, I wanted to be you, Batman.
I wanted to be as strong and as fast and as smart as Batman.
But you're not who I thought you were.
Whaddya mean?
You can't be a hero if you only care about yourself.
Barbara...

I think you're underestimating the importance of the Joker being in the Phantom Zone.
Really, kind of a stroke of genius...

I just put Joker in the one place he can't do anyone any harm.
Yeah.
But what if you just gave Joker exactly what he wanted?
[♪ THE PHANTOM ZONE]
Woah!

- HI!

- Sorry, I always do that!

Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy!
- Yeah, bad guy.

- Oh, that was my grandma's name.

Trying to assess whether you are bad.
Uh, your whole thing screams bad guy.
Oh yes...

But with vulnerabilities.
Who me?

They're standing right behind you.
Hi there guys, lovely to meet you all.

Doesn't matter, I'm the Joker.
- Take a look at the new guy.

Oh, no, no...


- You're boring.

- Huh?

Stop with the violence for just a second!
What if I told you I could get you out of here?
- I'm sorry, what'd you just say?

I'm so bad I got myself thrown into this heck-hole on purpose!
- I'm listening.

Look, everyone here knows what it's like to be hurt by a hero, don't they?
- We've all been taken for granted, right?

That's why I came to this space prison.
- To recruit the universe's greatest-

I'm sorry?
You were going to say something about recruiting the universe's greatest villains to conquer a super hero.
- Am I right?

- Well we're in.

Really, because I brought a PowerPoint pres-

- Do you want us to humiliate him?

You want us to make him grovel at your feet?
I would like to see that very much!
- You want us to smite him?

Do you want us to make the rivers of Gotham City run red with his blood?
- Oh, that's-

- Yes, lava.

- I can't wait to crush buildings

I don't wanna be a downer, but how exactly are we gonna get out of this place?
Oh, leave that to me.
I don't wanna jinx us, but I'll be a lot happier when this Phantom Zone Projector is locked up tight.
- Going up, Ma'am?

I guess you're right, I am going up.

Here comes the...

- I'm gonna go start looting.

The clown prince of crime is back.
Commissioner Gordon, you've got to take a look at this!
- What's that?

- Not that.

But in order to do that, I need to break my friends out of a giant, scary prison.
- Hey guys, he means us!

And I ain't talking about those rogue losers dressed in cosplay!
- Aww!

I'm talking about my new peeps!

The greatest villains you'll ever see.
- You wanna meet 'em?

Too bad.
He's evil, he's magic, and it's about to get tragic.
- It's Voldemort!

You are a fish!

He's a 9000 year old incarnation of evil with an eye for jewellery.
- Give it up for Sauron!

He likes long, violent walks on historic buildings, it's King Kong!
Come at me, Gotham!
Commissioner Gordon, these monsters, they're too powerful!
Can you contain them to Downtown?
That's gonna be impossible!

Sergeant Jackson, stop flopping around!
And rounding out the Evil All-Stars, Wicked Witch, Medusa,
- And British robots.

Ask your nerd friends.
Hello?

Ha haa... what a crew, huh?
And they all work for me!

Still not you.
Actually this does look pretty terrifying, Bat-Dad.
Nice destruction all around.

Now all that's left for me is to rub it in Batman's Bat-Face.
Hey Sauron!

Uh-huh.
Well, I need to find Batman, where's home boy's man cave?
Gimme a second.

Whoa, hold on a sec.
Are you trying to tell me that Bruce Wayne is Batman 's roommate?
Uh... yeah.
Evil Army, this way to the Batcave!
Good grief!
Hey, Batman.

I'm rubbing my butt all over your stuff.
Gonna have to rename this the Butt-Mobile.
Hey Evil Army, I need Batman brought here.
Now GO GET HIM!

- Uh...

Do you ever get scared?
No!
Yeah, that's what I figured.

Hey, kid...
- you know who does get scared?

Bruce Wayne.
- Really?

Bruno told me once, that sometimes the only way to get out of a down moment is to start boxing.
And by boxing, he meant beat-boxing.
Na na na na na na na na...
Feel it, uh-huh.
Dick Grayson on the mic, go!
- Oh my gosh, this does make me feel better.

Bat, Bat, can I get a Bat, Bat, can I get a
The Bat-Fax!
The city needs me!

Excuse me!

- Batman.

I sent the Bat-Fax.
I hate to say this, but...

Yes!

I'm only gonna let you out on one condition.
- Name it.

Fine.

No.

Oh I wanna help too.
And I shall join as well.
- Alfred Pennyworth at your service.

Sir, those creatures out there are unlike anything we've ever seen.
Speak for yourself.

And you'll never be able to defeat them alone.
And it'll be more fun if we all do it together.
What's the worst thing that could happen?

The thing I'm most afraid of?
I've gotta be honest with you, it's Snake-Clowns.
Yeah, that's not a thing.
Well then, nothing.

Okay.

- Oh I will.

You know what the B-A-T in Batman stands for?
- Not really.

Best At Teamwork Man is my full name.
- Yay, we're going on a family trip!

I can wear my costume too!
Well luckily for us, you left your costume back at the-

- RIP!

- I miss the 60s.
Hey, can Scarecrow help?

Why don't we use these guys?
What am I gonna do, get a bunch of criminals together to fight the criminals?

Okay guys, game plan.
- Joker's taken the projector to-

Right.

- We need that-

- Or there's no way to blast these-


- Batman, I really don't need you to finish my-

- Sister's homework?

- Succulent... something.

- Um, everybody?

Hey, everybody grab on to me!
We've gotta take cover!
- Joker has eyes on us.

No, I mean he literally has a giant eye on us.
I think that thing can see our every move.
We've got to destroy it, or we'll never make it to Wayne Manor.
Uh, Batman, I really think you should see this.
Building survey!
This building's not up to code!
Gotcha.
Is that real lava?
I'm okay!
Oh yeah, 100% lava.
- Everyone start throwing me bricks!

Yes.

- Batman?

Why'd you build this thing with only one seat?
Because last I checked I only had one butt.
What the-
[WAYNE MANOR, WAYNE ISLAND] What have you done to Wayne Manor?
[JOKER MANOR, JOKER ISLAND] Hey, Batman...

- I found out one of your secrets.

What do we have here, Batman?
Looks like a bunch of relationship comedies.
- What's that?

Must love crying!
- Marley and Me.

Oh!

We have Serendipity?

For a loner Batman, you sure like movies about relationships...
Oh, and look what else I found.
All your wonderful toys!
Accio lightning storm!
Everyone hold on!
Gremlins, dismantle that plane.

Ugly monsters on our 3.
- Uh, Padre?

Kinda got my hands full.
I've got good tone.

- Uh, Batman?

- Are we nearly at Wayne Manor?

Your number 2 needs to go number 1.
I thought I told you to go back in the prison.
- I tried but Bane was in there.

He had this sort of 'get out of this bathroom now' vibe.
I knew I shouldn't have given you that water.
Can you hold it in like a big boy?
- Engine 1's out.

- Engine 2 down.

- We've lost engine 3.

Engine 4...
That I do need to fix.
Good news, our bathroom problem is solved.
You 3 wait here while I go fix the engine.
Don't worry Batman:

All good, Babs, I got my auto-pilot.

Auto-pilot?

Thanks, rope.
Come on Master Dick, we need to help him.
- I'm with you Grandpa!

What are you 2 doing here?

You disobeyed me.

- Batman, you're on a time-out!

Alfred, you'd better un-time-out me right now.
No!

Guys!

- We have incoming!

Okay, everybody time-out off.
- Woohoo!

- No, protect the rope!

Save Master Dick!
I'm fine, I'll just do one of my gymnastic moves-
No!
Gotcha!
Hold on, Alfred.

No!
Alfred!
No.
No!
Move over, rope!
Hold on!
Gotcha!
Barbara, you see that?

Sick moves, bro.

- Actually Sir, Miss Gordon saved him.

Wait a minute, you mean, without you, Alfred would have been street meat?
Batman... trust us.

Yeah.

Sorry, what's that?
It's a gymnastics-based martial art.
I could punch those 80s monsters off the plane.
Uh, okay.
Multiple bogies on our 6.
Sir, I'll get them off our back:

Locked and loaded, Sir.
Good, love that.

Prepare to change course.

- What?

Alright.

- Giant sea monster at 12 o'clock.

- We've got his attention!

Ha ha ha!

Eat dirt!
Bomb zero bogies, ruddy duck cobblers!
Okay babs, this is it, fly straight into that eye and wait for my signal.
Can it come now?
- Can we make the signal thing happen?

Almost there!
- Fire!

That fire's coming in hot...

DIVE BOMB!
My eye!
[NO SIGNAL] SAURON!
Nothing to see...
- Whoo, we did it!

Come on, let's hear it for us.

- I felt so jazzed!

I've gotta give it to you, Batman.

- And you were awesome, you were awesome,

And I was amazing, but I'm not trying to make it about myself, obviously,
I just want to make sure that everyone gets a pat on the back.
- It feels good.

You had a good idea, and you had a good idea, and you had a good idea, and I had a great idea and I just,
I think that collectively, I'm gonna add... 1.
No way!
- Man, that feels good!

Let's take a photo!

Hang on a second.

- It's worth it!

- These abs are no fluke.

- Bat Family!

- Look at that.

Wow.

Hey guys, it's my first family photo!
Hey, Bat Dad.
- What are you doing?

Okay, just...
Batman, are you okay?
No, yeah, I'm fine.
We are just one big happy... fraternity of people, who did an awesome job together.
- I can't think of any other way to put that.

So, guys, listen up...
Taking the projector from the Joker is gonna be our most dangerous mission yet.
- A family battle mission!

Salvage what you can out of the Scuttler, maybe root around, see if you can find a few vitamin waters or something,
- then we'll head out.

- Anything for you, Padre.
- We'll need snow shoes...


- Sir?

Batman, please, wait!
'Puter.
- Yes Sir.

Take the Scuttler to the taco stand on the border of Gotham City and Bludhaven.
No!
I want you to get these guys a couple of Chimichangas and 3 Jarritos.
Sir!
And then keep them there until this whole attack on Gotham City blows over.
- Padre, please!

How many times I gotta tell you?
Batman works alone.
No, we have to stick together.
Please.
Go on, Scuttler, go!
- Go!

- Get moving!

- Just go.

- Scuttler, move out!

Listen to me, don't do this!
Nooo!
- Scanning for intruders...

Hi Bats.
What have you done to my...

You'd better hope he's a cool guy and doesn't go crazy.
- What happened to all your friends?

I don't need anyone to stop you.
Are you sure about that?

When I saw you working with your friend family,
I actually thought you'd changed.

You pushed them away.
You've run away from every other person in your life, but I'm the one you're always chasing.
- Is this about that stupid 'greatest enemy' thing?

- Not anymore.

- Time for a fresh start.

- I think after 78 years, I deserve respect.

Do you realize that you have never once said the words,
- 'I hate you Joker'?

Well I am starting to feel pretty annoyed with you right now.

I know it, we said the same thing!
Listen, Batman.

- Aww!

Now you say it.
Me too.
You won't.

Cause you can't.

Batman will never change!
You know uncle boo?

- These diseased lunatics are right.

- I'm not gonna be part of a one-sided relationship any longer!

- What are you talking about?

- What is wrong with you?

- That's ridiculous.

- No, you're not serious!

You know what, for once Batman you're right.

Your greatest enemy is you.
- Goodbye, Batman.

- Good for you, boo boo!

Everything get a bomb, let's go.

Say goodbye Gotham City!
[♪ THE PHANTOM ZONE]
- HI!

It's my fault, I keep doing that.

What are you talking about?

But you're all in black, you have a cape, and you wear a big scary mask.
- Well I'm not.

- Listen, I'm Batman.

- I swear, I'm a good guy.

Scanning for badness...
- You're super nimble, right?

- And 110% expendable.

- How'd I do, Dad?

Sorry.
Alfred, put that kid on the next jet to the orphanage.
But doesn't he deserve a chance for someone to take him under their wing?
As I took you under mine?
Listen, you don't have a family, so what do you know about having a surrogate son?
Batman, we have to stick together.
Please.
Joker, you mean nothing to me.
No one does.
You're not a traditional bad guy, but you're not exactly a good guy either.
You even abandon your friends.
- What?

- Batman, don't do this.
- No, I was trying to protect them!

Well, yeah.
Are they really the ones you're protecting?
Computer, Batman's in danger.

Do you really want the man who made you to come to harm?
Batman programmed me to obey him.
but he didn't say to not not rescue him.
What are they doing?
Come on guys, hustle, Gotham City's not going to blow itself up!
Well, hello.
'Puter, go to super secret stealth mode.
- Hold on!

Evil buddies, those are my last 3 painful reminders of Batman.
Run!

- Wait, where's Dick?

- What's he doing?

Just think, what would Batman do?
- What?

Kid, don't do that!
Atomic batteries to power.

Don't do what I would do!

Hold on a second, brick lady.

I can't let you go, my boss will be really mad at me.
Yeah, but I bet your boss would be happy if you were able to get all those bad guys back in here.
- Hmm, she sure would.

But haven't you tried that before?
This way Alfred.
You do the same thing over and over.
What's gonna change?
I know what I need to do.
Just give me 24 hours and I'll come back.
You've gotta let me go down there and save them.
I'll do whatever you want.
- Please.

Please.
- Okay, but I need all the bad guys locked up in here.

And I mean all of them.
One of these buttons has to save my friends!
- Self-destruct mode activated.

- Master Dick!

Look who's bat!
What?
Everyone okay?

- Are you guys-

Listen, I just wanted to say...
That I'm really... really... really... really really really...

- Sorry?

I don't even know why you bothered coming back.
I... was... afraid.
What?
The reason I came back was the same reason I left you.
I was afraid... of feeling...

Gotham needs us.
So I came back to do this.
Flip.
Flip?

You gotta turn around.
I call it the Babs Signal, and I'm flipping the switch for you.
Because saving this city is too big a job for one person.
Flip, flip.
So what do you say, Commish?

I need your help.
I thought you'd never ask.
I'm very, very proud of you, son.
But there's still only 4 of us against Joker's entire army.
That's why I called in some backup.
Flip flip flip flip...
- Woah!

Joker may be done with us, but we're not done with him.
- We will be the Joker's reckoning!

You were right Barbara:

Okay, everybody listen up.
These monsters wanna destroy Gotham City.
That's right.

An arsenal of advanced weaponry.
Costumes that suit our individual personalities.
RIP!
And codenames to use on our walkie-talkies.
- Call it out!

- Bat Lady.

- Soccer-Mom Bat.

How about a cool costume?

- That one's called 'Batgirl'.

And lastly, a coordinated attack strategy and a kick butt theme song.

- My superhero codename!

- First, driving.

Now fly.

Run over these skeletons.

- Great driving!

Okay, Robin, together we're gonna punch these guys so hard words describing the impact are going to spontaneously materialize out of thin air.

- Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy.

Oh my gosh, yes!
Here you go, grandpa.
Hey Batman!
Get off my Padre!
It wasn't useless after all!

Adios, Shark!
Okay, we have 'em beat guys.

It's the end of Gotham City!
As I predicted... we're doomed!
We're not doomed, I got this.
Everyone grab on to me.
Come on guys, we need to hold this city together!
- Bat-Rope, no!

No, we have to stick together!

- We need to use our heads

- Stick together...

I got it!

- Robin, quick, give me a boost!

We're gonna stick together using our heads, and the most powerful weapon of all, shredded abs.

- You got this, Alfred?

Great!

No!
- Joker, please, help us.

at least if this city is destroyed, I'll die knowing I'm your greatest enemy.
I have to die to know it.
Shut up Joker!

What?
You're the reason why I get up at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and pump iron until my chest is positively sick.
You're the reason I've given up a life spent with Russian ballerinas and Lady Activewear models.
And if it wasn't for you, I never would have learned how connected I am with all these people and you.
So if you help me save Gotham you'll help me save us.
You just said, "us"?
Yeah.

What do you say?
You had me at 'shut up'.
- How are your abs, bro?

Because I need you to crunch them.
Citizens of Gotham!

I'm just gonna come right out and say it.
I hate you, Joker.
- I hate you, too.

- I hate you the most.

We did it everyone!
Bane is feeling warm and fuzzy.
Padre.
Where you going?
I made a promise.
I gotta go back to the Phantom Zone.
- Sorry, kid.

- Don't call me Padre.

Call me...
Dads.
My 2 dads are the same dad!
But, they're both leaving.
It's gonna be okay, kid.
Sometimes losing people is part of life.
But that doesn't mean you stop letting them in.
Some very wise people taught me that.
My father figure.
My platonic co-worker buddy, who's a girl, but just a friend.
And you... 'Mi Hijo'.

This is my family, but it's your family too.
- You have a knife?

Because someone needs to cut the tension between the 2 of us.
- Okay, I deserve that.

Wait a minute, what's going on?
I came back, just like I said I would,
You know, Mr Batman, when you're a talking brick working at the Phantom Zone you see a lot of crazy things.
But I've finally seen a man, in order to make the world a better place, take a look at himself, and make a change.
Who?
- Superman.

I'm kidding.

Well, I guess I'll be seeing you on the streets, Batman.
- I guess so. catch you later, Joker.

We're not just gonna let these criminals go, right?
Ah come on Comish, let's face it, those guys are no match for the 4 of us.
We'll give them a 30 minute head start.
