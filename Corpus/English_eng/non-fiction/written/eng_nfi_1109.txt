No, you give me the Crunch Berries, then you get the remote, dumb-dumb.
No, I want...

You're not gonna get the remote.
- And then I will give you this.

- Guys, we've got a problem.

Saturday morning cartoons start very soon and all we have is this mini nug.
Maybe enough for one hit each, tops.
So if my math is correct, that's only, like...
This is fine, okay?

We need to figure out a way to maximize our precious resources.
- Okay?

Just be willing to try any angle.
- Okay, so let's try angles.

Try some angles...

- High.

We wanna get high.

BermuDope HighAngle.
BermuDope HighAngle.
Get me a marker!
Okay, so listen up, all right?
On the count of three, we blaze the little bit of nug we have.
- Yep.

Then, next sound of the shotgun...
Inhale, pipe from the left...

Let's go, come on.
Okay, let's just get to blazing
- so we can watch "Paw Patrol."

- Yeah.

Roast your bowlios.
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.
Exhale!
- What?

- I'm pulling over.

Dude, is this for real?
Hola, welcome to the BermuDope HighAngle.
Dude, this is the next, next, next, man.
I mean, the hits just keep coming.
- Oh, I'm super high.

What is this for?

No, no, no, no, this is just us.
What we do on a Saturday with my bros.
Smoking weed with my only friends.
- I love you guys.

I really love you.
You guys are great dudes.
Is it cool if we get in on that or...
- Yes, please.

- Yes!

- That's awesome, man.

Like, they gotta see this.
Yeah, dude, more people, yeah... call 'em up, man.
I got a pocket full of rubbers, and my homeboys do too.
- Wait, what's up?

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'll spread the word.

- Right, right.

- Wait, what?

- You guys said...

Dude, we're supposed to be at work right now.
Okay, should we just go?

Oh, we got a flat tire on the way... or, like, we slept in.
Anders, it's not about flat tires or sleeping in.
It's about the fact that we don't get to watch "Paw Patrol"
until 24 hours from now.
♪ I'm fresh ♪
♪ You gotta, you gotta, you gotta ♪
♪ Gotta be fresh ♪
Dude, you just rolled, like, 30 joints in, like, what ten minutes?
Yeah, yeah, yes, I did.
And I'm about to smoke five in ten seconds.
- Oh, my God, dude!

- He continues to amaze me.

- This is magic right here.

Like, would that be cool with you?
Like, not to be weird.
Uh... okay.
♪ And The Human Jock Box ♪
- ♪ We got the beats ♪

It tickles!

Oh-oh, gosh!

I'm kidding.

Ahh!
What can I say?

A what like who?
Tom Jager, baby.
♪ Here's a funky fresh sound ♪
Okay, does anyone know who he's talking about?
- We are freakin' party gods!

Yo, dudes!
Are you guys drinking on the roof?
That's that next-next like next-next, dude.
It is the next-next.

It's just part of living that tight butthole life.
Oh, tight butthole!

Yo, I'm Snapchatting this if that's cool.
Yo, the bros are my new favorite dudes.
They throw down, they smoke!
And they keep a tight butthole!
Tight butthole!

Tight butthole!

Whoo!
We really blew this bitch up, didn't we?
Check this out.

- Oh!

You boys made quite the noise this weekend,
Lot of people that think you're pretty dope.
Or should I say... tight butthole?
You could say that.
- We do say that.

- So don't use it.

Marketing director, Bango Energy Drinks.
We saw the social media blitz you guys pulled off over the weekend, and it was gorgeous.
We believe with our sponsorship, we can take your parties up a notch and get rich quick.
Oh, my God.

Yeah, that's my favorite way to get rich, yeah.
You guys, we can quit TAC and just, like, get wasted all the time!
- I'm in, sir.

That's a dream come true, yes.

I'm gonna be like...

- I can't think of a mogul.

- Paula Abdul.

I'm kinda sketched out, guys.
- I don't know if I wanna do this.

No, not really!

I got you, man.

Make that a Bango.
- That's a free can.

Plenty more where those came from.
- He gave it to me.

And just to show you we're down, this is a bucket hat.
I want you guys to share it.
- Whoa!

- Give it!

- Be cool in front of the dude!

Oh, sorry, dude.

Looks pretty tight butthole, right?
- Tight butthole!

- One, two, three, four...

Oh, good girl.

- Wiggle waggle.

Yeah!

- Nice.

- I'll lift you up.

Yeah, no, you don't need to lift me.
Because I actually have an assistant now.
Flex for 'em, Goons.

Pop them titties.

- Hoist thy ankles, Goons.

- He repeats everything I say.

Actually, let's record this, right?
- Okay.

Let's all start at 20 so it seems like
I'm better at drinking and then we hashtag it "Bango"
- on all social media, okay?

- Get it!

You didn't hit record.

- Go again.

Go, Anders!

You see that?

None of that bodysuit bullshit.

- What're jammers?

- No, no.

You're a joke.
Can we watch the basketball game for a little bit?
It's game seven today.
Looks like you're done for the night.
What?
Never heard of a boot and rally?
I just made room for ten more drinks, sista.
And trust me, I know what I'm talking about because I get paid to party.
You've been Bango'd.
I'm the daddy.

- Dude, this is so dope.

Ooh, you like that?

- You like that?

So you're, like, weird, huh?
Yeah, you don't just slam beers.
Like, you do all this crazy stuff.
Yeah, sometimes I slam the occasional beer and sometimes I just like to blaze up and get weird.
Huh?
- Let's get weird!

Yeah, what's up with the wigs?

Bango slacker costumes, free when you buy a case.
- Oh, that's dope.

- Oh, hey, man.

- You want...

- one of those.

Okay, yeah, I don't really believe in a supreme being.
I'm, uh...

Oh, like weed!
I didn't get it at first, but now that I do,
I'm in, like, a way better place emotionally.
- Yo, hit this, dude.

- Oh, yeah, hit that shit, bro.

- Yeah, two hands.

See this guy?
Yeah, hey, who wants to see me jump off this freakin' roof?
Oh, I do!
- Dude!

Yeah, I'm gonna.

Everybody starts talking about you at the party, it's cool.
You know what?

- We should do it.

- We're going.

- Well, that's sort of my thing.

No, no!

No, you... you can't!

That's my thing!
I'm gonna do it too!

No, only one person can do it.

Dude, are you okay?
So bad!

It's nothing a little weed won't fix, right?
I don't know.
Later, skaters!

- Actual skaters, baby!

Good morning.

I'm so proud of you.

You guys are off the Richter scale.
Death toll in the hundreds.
Thank you so much for saying that... that means a lot.
Yeah, man, it was awesome, but hey.
I got a couple creative ideas to run past you, all right?
- Sure.

Like, everybody dresses up like clowns or, like, post-apocalyptic.
Something like way out there and crazy, right.
- Yeah.

- Yep.

But on a webseries.
- Are we talking business?

- Isaac.

Isaac Lubetkin, Adam's manager.
This webseries.
Are we talking a rev-share?
Because that's a thing I've at least overheard
- is a word for stuff.

Gentlemen, we've built a brand.
- Now we build an empire.

Fu... yeah, I was just saying that.
That's also one of my favorite shows.
We build a set, we hire extras.
We shoot four scripted parties a day in a controlled environment and then we drop a new party episode online every Friday and the kids can party with the dudes world wiz-ide.
- On the world wide wiz-eb.

We are gold until we drop season two and that's when the money starts rolling in.
Okay, yeah!
Hang on, hang on, hang on, okay?
'Cause my client's not just gonna keep working
- for a hat split three ways.

Those days are over, Kurt, baby.
- My guy right here...

He is willing to work for three hats split one way.
I think I can get you one hat.
- Hang on.

Yeah, baby.
We can work with that.
Ders, Ders, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're drinking out of a garbage can, man.
It's a garbage cup.
♪ He's insane ♪
The ff...
All right, everybody, let's clear the set.
Hello.
We're rolling in five.
Hello?

Yeah, I got eyes on Blake.
Morning, Blake, they need you in hair and makeup before you meet with the stunt coordinator.
What?

I got some email from Isaac yesterday.
Evidently, stunts are exclusive to Adam.
That is correct, but we're still going back and forth on Adam's contract, and honestly, your hair is testing better than Adam's dimples.
Yeah, so we think this is the best move for "Party Gawds."
I don't know.
Why don't you just let Ders do it or something?
He's not in the best of condition.
Hey.
What do you say we go back to my dressing room, strip you down to nothing but that belt and like the world's about to end?
- Excuse me?

Okay, yo, whoa!

It's a weave.
Kurt wanted to amp up your look.
Make it bigger.

Okay, no, that's insane.
I look like a Mortal Kombat character.
I think you look cool.

Uh... what are you doing here, man?
Oh, I'm here to watch, man.
Bango hooked me up with a set visit instead of paying my medical bills.
Pretty sick, right?
- Tight butthole.

Um, so, uh... when are you gonna be walking again?
- Like, a week or a month?

But it's cool, man.

- I'm so jealous.

Stop!

Yeah, his hair's perfect.

You guys, no, it's gone too far, all right?
You have to stop.

The partying, the clothes, the hair.
I mean, come on!

It's dead fingernails or something like fingernails...
Like, but on your head, like a horn, like a rhino's horn, which is also hair, I think...
- Don't say that.

Okay, no.

- No.

It's just hair, man.

- No, no!

I'm doing it!
- Don't!

- Shut up!

No!
Why?
It's not me.

Ahh!

Now that that's gone, whom is your party gawd now?
You still look incredible.
Hey.

- I'll be your god.

Oh, fine, fine!

Dude, there's no booze anywhere on set.
Okay, this stuff?

"Oh, here we go, let's party.

It's all fake.

I don't know what's real anymore.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

We'll get him some water, some rest, I'll take care...
What happened to your goddamn hair?
- It's gone, okay?

No, no, no, no, 'cause I'm sick of being used, all right?
I'm a human being!

- Step back!

I like the sound of that.
Isaac, let's do action figures, right?
- Done.

Yeah, which was, by the way, a terrible idea.
- I still like it, though.

And that's why we're still doing it.
Okay, Goons, turkey bacon shake?
Turkey bacon shakin', baby doggy.
Thank you, baby doggy.
Kurt, I got great news, okay?

That means my boy Adam is ready to crush this opening stunt, all right?
Only deal is, he's gotta be in Slim Jim.
All right, everything Slim Jim, Kurt.
Top to bottom, it's gotta be Slim Jim, okay?
Blake's doing the stunt.
You backstabbing, hairy asshole.
Adam, I'm not doing the stunt, all right?
Your brand!
I don't care about the brands, Adam, stop.
After all the exposure that I've given us with my SoCal Helpful Honda center radio spot audition,
- potential forthcoming callback?

All right, I'm doing the stunt.
Excuse me.

You're not doing the stunt.
Well, newsflash, sir.

- Fine!

- I'll do the stunt.

- I ain't afraid to die.

- He doesn't even have a brand.

He doesn't even have a brand...
Whoa!
- Oh, shit!

There's a whole thing with a Vespa and some Silly String.
Oh, my God, Ders!
Did you do this to spite me?
I was just trying to kill myself.
So then that's yes?

- What?

Is that what... you don't even have a brand, Ders.
At least Blake had a brand til he shaved it off.
He doesn't even have a brand!

You're a nice guy, and I plan on speaking at your wedding, but we are done professionally, mate.
Okay, look, these Bango guys, they got us all twisted up, but you... we don't have to act like this, Adam.
I don't have to do a lot of things, okay?
- Like be your guys's friend.

Another one of those things that I don't have to do is wipe properly because I have a guy for that now.
That' strange.

Yes, he wipes my ass for me, Blake.
It's part of having an assistant!
Good for you, Adam, but, you know, I have followers.
That kid right there, he tried to kill himself for me.
- That's pretty cool.

That's it.

You think you're so cool 'cause you got swag and followers.
Wow, great.

- Nothing, really?

- I don't know karate.

I never claimed to know karate ever.
Yeah, I don't think you know karate.
I'm not saying I do.

Hey boys, come on, Let's party this puppy off.
Or pretend.

You know what?
- This, right?

'Cause I'm done, so I will see you guys... but I don't wanna be you guys.
Laugh harder.

- That was...

Catchphrase!
Yeah, this right here, I don't understand.
Why am I not the guy in the chair, right?
Oh, no, Adam, that's not how a bar mitzvah works.
I thought I was DJing at a sports bar called Bar Mitt Fuzz.
It's a bar mitt and there's fuzz in it.
- Bar Mitt Fuzz, baby doggy!

- Please, stop baby-dogging.

Wod it kill you to play another song?
Why, you don't like this one?
I think Asher Roth is tight butthole.
But not 12 times in a row.
This song's very tight butthole.
The more you listen to it, the better it gets.
- It soaks in ya, right?

Sorry, sir.

Oh, you're gonna talk to me?

Stop.
Don't laugh quite that hard.
Oh, man, you're gonna talk to me?
Well, Isaac, I do the talking.

Hey, bud.

No matter how much you brand, no matter how much you work, your friends will backstab you.
Stab you in the back with a friendship knife!
Because they are jealous of your success.
And they'll betray you and steal the stunt.
I'm sorry that I'm screaming.
Mayim Bialik, everyone.

- Uh, that's an actress.

- She's Sheldon's girlfriend.

You're a good guy and I like you and I still plan on being a pallbearer at your sister's funeral, but we're done professionally.
Done professionally, my baby...
Stop it, Goons!

And you are fired.

And you are immediately rehired, Goons, because I need a ride home.
Hey..

Tight butthole, man?

Hey, I was just wondering, maybe you'd be more comfortable wearing something on your head?
Oh, you want me to cover my head?

Something bothering you about it?
Look it's not me, okay?

You know, it's just the people probably came here to, you know, see the hair and the cars.
Here, why don't you put on this?
Look, Diaz, why don't you take a walk, all right, before I lose my cool.
Put on the hat.

Yeah, okay, I'll wear that hat.
- Big fan.

It gets sleazy.
And, uh... tight butthole.
Hup!

Nicely done.
God, it feels good to be back on the deck, away from all the BS... those clowns...
- Hey.

Sorry to be such a loose butthole, but can you get back to the announcer's booth?
The next heat is about to start.
Right, yeah, sorry.
Good job, Corey.
All right, and next, we've got the boys, 11-12, 100 butterfly.
National record held by the Chas Morton, of course.
In lane eight, Pat Heffernan.
♪ But my good friends is all I need ♪
Lane eight.

You guys ever feel like sometimes you're in the lane eight of life?
Probably we all do.
Treading water, trying to keep your head above when we should really probably just sink to the bottom of the pool, open our mouths, and... let the water end it all.
Nope, okay.
In lane seven,
Brian Newman.
Look who it is!
Blakey the loser came crawling back to TAC.
Well you're here, so "loser" you too, bitch.
Well, you're...

You're a son of one.

- Son of a bitch,

That means your mom is!
No... oh, don't bring my mother...
Yeah, yeah, your mom!
- You know not to bring mama...

I bring your mama!
Stop!

Because you bother suck at it.
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you're both losers!
- I hate you.

- I hate you!

I hate you!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

- I thought you were friends!

Friends don't talk like this to each other.
So I don't want to hear any more of this nonsense because I know you're better than that!
And guys, don't take what you have for granted.
Because you don't know what you've got til it's gone.
- Yeah.

I mean..
- Yeah.

- And Waymond never shuts up!

- Rambling.

- Yeah, you too.

I mean, freakin' motormouth, but he had a point.
He did.
You know, guys, I think it's...
I think it's time we quit the show.
Ohho-ho-ho.

'Sup, slap dicks?

Water under the B-ridge?

'Cause tonight's gonna be insane.
- Back at the stage...

We're done.

We're not doing it for the money.
And we're not doing it for the Bango.
- Although, we like the Bango.

- You have to be joking.

You're gonna give up the ultimate gig of party gawds for what, weekend warrior wannabes?
- Come on.

- friends only.

We had a great ride.

Take this Bango slacker wig.

Oh, okay.

- Smart.

- and neo-conformity.

- I don't think so, all right?

You guys don't like this look?
You know, you're not that good-looking with it,
- but without it, very foul.

- Oh, yeah.

- That's a keeper.

You ever heard of "puff, puff, pass," mother?
Get in on that.

- That's real weed.

- That's real weed.

You know, I'm sorry about being such an egomaniac.
You know, I feel like I really learned something
- by having the show.

- Well, it's a webseries.

It's like I just need to be, like, a team player, and like, I'm one of the guys.
- Yeah, totally.

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

I love you guys... real talk, I'm telling you right now.
I think the most important thing is that we just
- stay true to each other.

- Yep.

- I take the wig off, you know?

- Oh, yeah.

If you take that wig off, I will, I swear to God.
Yeah, if I learned anything from having the show...
- Excuse me, webseries...

It's that you're the hair guy.
You know, you are the hair.

- and a large jaw.

- You're tall?

- Thank you, thank you so much.

- Yeah, that's the show.

- We should have a TV show or something.

Nice.
