You do realize you're going.
To have to take a bubble bath.
After you eat that.
Do you want to hold it now?
Grandma...
Two more.
There's one down there, too.
My mom was one.
Of my best friends.
I talked to my mom every day.
One day, I called her,
And it just rang.
And rang and rang.
Nobody ever answered.
You come up with every reason.
That she's fine.
She's just not here,
But she's fine.
That's how you go.
To sleep at night.
We would talk regularly.
About lynda's whereabouts.
There were a lot.
Of missing pieces.
I just wanted to find her,
To help her.
You don't know what to do,
And you feel this guilt.

Lynda was ecstatic.
To be a grandmother.
She was thrilled.
She was the boss.
Of being grandma.
happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday
My mom, she let my oldest son...
Kind of let him run the show.
She did whatever.
He wanted her to do.
If he wanted to play baseball,
She played baseball.
If he wanted to run around,
They ran around.
In the spring of 2000, 44yearold lynda mcclelland.
Is a doting grandmother of two.
With a third grandchild.
On the way.
happy birthday to you
My mom was very, very excited.
I was crying,
And she was so happy.
Ready to make a wish?
They didn't live.
Very far from her.
She decided "That's who"
I'm going to live for."
Are you ready?
So I could not believe.
When my sister came up missing.
It was like any other morning.
I got up,
Made coffee,
Made the kids' breakfast.
We kind of got ready.
For the day.
If I woke up in the morning.
24yearold amanda.
Repasky is a stayathome mom.
While her husband, david,
Works as a cook.
And occasionally.
Repossesses cars.
The two met when they.
Were in high school.
It's hard to raise children.
Later that morning, amanda.
Receives an unexpected visit.
From her mother's.
Boyfriend, nate linson.
Nate, what's going on?
Lynda and nate have been.
Dating for 5 years,
And amanda knows they had.
An argument the night before.
I went to her house.
She was breaking up with him,
And because my mom wasn't home.
He was alarmed.
Something's not right.
I told him to leave her alone,
To give her some space.
It kind of upset me.
That he went over there.
When nate leaves,
Amanda tries calling her mom,
Who lives alone.
Less than a mile away.
Lynda works as a server.
At a local restaurant,
But amanda knows she's supposed.
To have the day off.
It just rang and rang and rang.
Nobody ever answered.
My sister was very reachable.
We didn't have cellphones, but
I always knew where to find her.
If she was going to a friend's.
Or something, she told somebody.
Her house was two football.
Fields away from her job.
She shopped.
In the same parking lot.
You knew where she...
She wasn't going anywhere.
I went on my day.
I didn't become alarmed.
Until probably around 5:00 or 6:00.
When I hadn't heard from my mom.
By the evening, amanda.
Knew something was wrong,
Like, "Why isn't my mom."
Answering or calling?"
Amanda was pregnant, so lynda.
Would be calling every day.
"How do you feel?"
Do you need anything?
"Are you out of crackers?"
I went to her house.
It was probably around 8:30.
I thought it was odd.
Because her door was locked.
Her door wouldn't be locked, 'cause she always left.
Her door open just in case,
I guess, I mean, someone needed.
To get in or come over.
When I entered, her house.
Was out of place.
Her keys were there,
And her phone wasn't there,
But the wire was there.
It looked like it had been cut,
Which was odd.
So, at that point,
I was very concerned.
That night,
I went to the police.
Um, I need to report.
A missing person.
I told them that we hadn't.
Heard from her all day.
At first, they told me.
They couldn't do anything.
And it hadn't been 48 hours yet.
And maybe something was wrong,
And she needed help.
That's all I knew.
As amanda provides police.
With background on her mom,
Memories of her childhood.
Come flooding back.
My mom loved.
Me and my sister.
I mean, she was.
So happy to have us.
The first time I remember.
I was probably only 3.
She was hugging me,
Which is very endearing.
However, she was hurting me.
She was holding me too tight.
I remember my dad.
Trying to tell her.
And that she needed.
To let me go.
Maybe she thought that somebody.
Was about to hurt me.
At some point, she was diagnosed.
With schizophrenia.
When lynda was on medication,
She was normal.
I mean, she went to work.
She paid her bills.
She did everything.
That she was supposed to,
But you knew if she.
Didn't take her medicine.
Everyone did.
When my mom was off.
Her medication, like,
She would kind of see things.
That weren't there.
But according to her.
Family, the last several years.
Have been one of the most stable.
Periods in her life.
She made great friends.
She had a nice house,
And she was really happy.
She was normal, healthy,
As healthy as somebody with.
Her mental illness could be.
That night, forest hills police.
Put out a missing persons.
Bulletin for lynda mcclelland.
And gather more information.
From amanda.
He was concerned about her,
So he went over.
And when amanda provides details.
About the previous night,
Police believe there may be.
Cause for concern.
Dave, the kids, and I.
Went out to a street fair,
And when I returned home,
I had a lot of missed.
Calls from nate.
So I called him back,
And he was upset.
He said my mom wasn't okay,
And that she was throwing glass.
And breaking glass.
Around her house.
So a friend of mine.
Watched my kids.
While I went to go.
Check on my mom.
Mom!
Mind if we come in?
Sure.
When I got there, she was fine.
She had broken a glass.
That was on a shelf.
He's overblowing things.
Like he always does.
Why would you listen.
To nate?
She was sound.
She appeared fine.
There was no reason for me.
To be concerned.
I am fine.
Amanda knows her mom's.
Relationship with nate.
Had run its course, and they.
Were no longer getting along.
I had known, earlier that day,
That they were fighting.
Both of them called me.
And talked to me.
I had told him just.
To leave her alone.
I don't know why.
He overreacted like that.
I really don't.
Come on, honey.
Let's go home.
Night, mom.
They talked for a time,
And amanda felt.
That her mother was okay.
So she and her husband left,
And that ended up being the last.
Time that she saw her mother.
Because of the urgency,
Because of the history.
Of mental illness,
Because of the possibility.
That she had wandered off.
And was confused, forest hills.
Police did alert the media.
And let them know.
That lynda mcclelland.
Was missing.
Her, to me, she appeared fine.
However, I started.
To secondguess myself...
He's overblowing things.
Like he always does.
- And think, - "What if I misjudged,
"And she was off her medication?"
Night, mom.
As news of lynda's disappearance.
Spreads through town,
Family members begin.
To scour forest hills.
And the surrounding area.
In between lynda's house.
And where dave and amanda lived.
Lot of woods in between.
Lynda had walked to their home,
And I know that amanda.
Hiked every inch.
Of those woods pregnant.
We put signs up everywhere.
Like, everybody was looking.
For lynda at that point.
My mom was loved.
By everyone that met her.
She would give the shirt off.
Of her back to help anyone.
At this point,
Everyone was concerned.
I was a member of the allegheny.
County police department.
Homicide unit.
They called us in to assist.
With the investigation.
So when was the last time.
You spoke to your mother?
Anything could have been.
Possible at that point.
She could have.
Committed suicide.
She could have been murdered.
She could have died.
Accidentally,
Or she could have.
Just left the state.
And started a new life.
Can you describe.
What your mother was like?
My parents met in high school.
They were really in love.
And then my dad.
Joined the army,
And then my mom and him.
Traveled around.
I was born in 1976.
My sister was born actually.
Not even 13 months later.
She wanted to be married.
And raise kids.
She wanted to be a mom.
According to amanda,
Lynda was a loving mom.
But as the girls grow older,
The family begins to see signs.
That things are off.
My mother was a very.
Spiritual person.
When we lived in germany,
She used to take us to churches,
And we would just sit there.
For sometimes hours.
And just look.
At the different statues.
And graves.
Most of the time, she prayed.
For me and my sister,
That we would be.
Healthy and happy,
That we would find the person.
That we're supposed to,
Have healthy and happy kids.
I was 9 years old the first time.
That my mom disappeared.
And it was me and my sister,
And our cat was about.
To have kittens.
We were really excited,
So we came.
And were looking all over.
The place for the cat.
I remember opening.
The closet door.
To see if the cat.
Was in the closet,
And her stuff was missing,
And we realized.
That she was gone.
At that age, I don't think.
We really understood.
What it meant to be sick.
Or have a mental illness.
I mean, at 9, I wanted my mom.
I'm a girl, you know.
When you're a girl, you want.
Your mom at 9 years old.
It's like she snapped.
She started to disappear.
For a couple weeks.
At a time here,
A couple weeks at a time there,
And not really give any location.
Where she was going.
Or why she was going.
Lynda's behavior puts.
A strain on the marriage.
And when amanda is 12.
And living in indiana,
Her parents divorce.
Her father gains.
Custody of the girls.
To be close to her parents.
He used to always tell me.
And my sister that she loved us,
That it wasn't her fault,
And that, if she could be there.
With us, that she would be.
After she got divorced.
And moved to pennsylvania,
She was getting healthy again.
She took her medicine every day,
Did everything.
That you're supposed to do.
She got her home.
She had a job.
She was at the hospital.
Every day for my dad,
Taking food to my mom.
She was taking care.
Of the family.
And live with her,
More than anything.
Four years later, amanda moves.
To forest hills to join her mom.
I moved in with my mom at 16,
And we ended up.
Being best friends.
I talked to her.
About everything.
Had she mentioned.
That anything was wrong?
I wanted more than anything.
For her to call.
I wanted her to call.
And be upset with me.
Because I did have.
Everyone looking for her,
And I did call the cops.
She... she told me she was fine,
But I don't know.
Lynda had disappeared.
In the past,
But I know my sister.
This time, when she left,
This time, it was.
Definitely different.
That lynda had occasionally.
Gone missing in the past,
A search of her home.
Suggests possible foul play.
The house.
Was in somewhat disarray.
There were items.
Scattered about.
One thing of note was there was.
Some dried cleanser in the sink.
Was typically.
A very clean person,
Keeping a very neat home,
And that wouldn't be something.
That lynda would normally leave.
The other weird circumstance.
Was that her telephone base.
And handset were missing.
From the home,
But the purse was left behind.
That's a red flag that.
Maybe something happened,
Either foul play.
Or perhaps lynda did,
In fact, take her own life.
But investigators find no traces.
Of blood anywhere in the house.
The crime lab.
Actually used luminol,
And that was all negative.
Another day goes by,
And lynda's family.
Continues to put up posters.
And scrapes together money.
For a reward.
They also keep searching.
The heavily wooded areas.
That surround pittsburgh.
You're in limbo.
You stop everything.
You don't sleep.
You're not eating.
It was horrible.
David was worried.
About amanda's state.
Because she was pregnant.
She lost weight.
She was shaking.
She couldn't sleep.
Every time my phone rang,
I thought,
Going to be it."
And then I would be disappointed.
Every time I answered the phone.
I just wanted to find her,
To help her.
While amanda holds out hope.
That her mom is still alive,
Police pay a visit to lynda's.
Boyfriend, nate linson,
Who offers a strange.
Theory of his own.
Nate linson?
That's right.
We're investigating.
The disappearance of lynda.
He told us that he thought.
That lynda may have taken.
A walk in the woods.
It was kind of an odd statement.
To just throw out there.
It was obviously something.
That we had to follow up on.
Nate would say, "I'm so."
"Sorry, lynda," to her picture.
He would apologize to me,
And I would ask him, like,
"What are you sorry for?"
When's the last time.
You seen her?
You might want to take.
A walk in the woods.
That he thought that lynda may.
Have taken a walk in the woods.
He said that she had a dream.
That somebody was.
In her backyard.
In the woods behind her home.
Digging a hole.
That was kind of.
An odd thing to say.
Then he made some comments.
About how he and lynda.
Would take long rides together.
So we didn't know if maybe lynda.
Went with her boyfriend,
And something happened.
I loved her to death,
But she had her own unique way.
Nate also tells investigators.
That lynda called him the night.
Before she disappeared,
Leaving him several.
Voicemail messages.
Mind if I check inside.
The house, take a look around?
Look away, sir.
I got nothing to hide.
He agrees to let detectives.
Search his home.
We did want.
To retrieve the messages.
From his answering machine.
We also had to look into.
Every possibility,
That maybe something happened.
To lynda at his home.
I did kind of suspect.
That something happened.
I thought maybe.
They went for a ride.
They got into a fight.
Maybe she got out of the car.
Amanda came to my home the night.
My sister came up missing.
She thought that nate had.
A little something to do.
With where lynda was,
And he wasn't telling us.
And as more time passes,
Amanda finds nate's behavior.
Increasingly suspicious.
He would say some very.
Strange things.
Nate would say, "I'm so sorry",
"Lynda," to her picture.
He would apologize to me,
And I would ask him, like,
"What are you sorry for?"
But he never really.
Would answer.
Or maybe were you.
Fighting with her,
"And she fell down the steps?"
I would try to get him.
To tell me what happened.
But when investigators.
Search nate's home,
Only a mile and a half.
From lynda's,
They come up emptyhanded.
We'll be in touch.
With you.
There was.
No indication or no evidence.
Of any type of foul play.
That occurred at his home.
There was no physical evidence.
Linking him to the crime,
And as it turns out, there was.
Really nothing of any value.
In those messages that helped us.
With the investigation.
At that point, we had no.
Reason to believe.
That he had anything to do.
With her disappearance.
His general demeanor,
Although odd,
It was very clear.
That he cared deeply for lynda.
Instead, nate urges police.
To consider the possibility.
That lynda took her own life,
A scenario that amanda's.
Husband, david, also raises.
There was an initial report.
That lynda had made.
Some statements.
About harming herself,
In particular,
That lynda had threatened to.
Jump off the westinghouse bridge.
About two weeks prior.
To her disappearance.
This bridge, in particular,
Is wellknown in the area.
For people to commit suicide.
By jumping off of it.
It's a very high bridge.
It goes over a very,
Very narrow body of water.
However, we did conduct.
A very thorough search.
Of that entire area,
But we didn't find any.
Evidence of lynda's remains.
And amanda refuses to believe.
That her mother would.
Take her own life.
My mom had a saying,
When she would get frustrated,
"I'm going to jump.
Off the bridge."
It never meant anything, though.
She was so excited.
About the new baby coming.
She would never have left.
The grandkids, never.
With no sign of lynda anywhere,
Detective opferman tries to.
Prepare amanda and her family.
For the worstcase scenario.
I recall telling her.
That she had to be prepared.
For the possibility that we may.
Never find her mother,
Also the possibility.
That we may find her deceased.
He didn't sugarcoat things.
He warned me ahead of time.
But when you do watch the news,
And you do see that.
They found a woman,
"Is this going to be it?"
It's hard not knowing.
Where someone that you love is.
Just when the leads.
Are beginning to dry up,
A witness who'd seen.
A story about lynda.
On the local news calls police.
With some new information.
- Finally someone was like, - "I know her."
It's been a week.
Since lynda mcclelland.
Vanished without a trace.
From her home.
In forest hills, pennsylvania,
And there has been.
No apparent sign of her.
Until now.
This tip that we got.
Was that lynda was seen.
On a walking trail.
In an adjacent county.
To our jurisdiction.
That woman was very adamant.
That the person was,
In fact, lynda mcclelland.
So opferman had to go out.
To this trail.
For three or four days.
He would show the picture.
Of my mom to people.
You might have seen her.
Around here.
Yeah.
I saw her just yesterday.
And finally, someone.
Was like, "I know her."
Who worked at.
A nearby restaurant.
They were similar in appearance,
But this woman was.
Somewhat younger than lynda.
It was very clear.
That it wasn't lynda.
I remember opferman calling me.
And saying, "My gosh."
She looked identical.
To your mom.
"It's like her twin."
But it was not her.
That the outcome is not.
Going to be the best,
I don't think you ever.
Really give up hope.
When you're driving,
And you see somebody.
That looks like that person,
You have to stop.
You have to look at their face.
You have to turn around.
Everybody walked like her.
If you walked like her,
If you had a purse like her,
Every single person,
You think it's her.
When it was.
My oldest son's birthday,
And she didn't call.
And tell him "Happy birthday,"
I think that was, in my head,
The first time.
That I didn't expect her.
To turn up after that.
Do you want to hold it now?
Grandma...
There was no way that,
If she was alive,
That she would.
Let him have his day.
Without her telling him.
"Happy birthday."
Kind of slippery.
Here, grab ahold of this.
No way.
The search for lynda.
Continues for weeks.
And then months,
And still no leads.
Detective opferman eventually.
Moves onto other cases,
But he promises amanda he won't.
Stop looking for her mom.
We continued to check.
With hospitals.
We continued to monitor.
Any records.
About any remains.
That were recovered.
We had no real information.
About where lynda could be.
The case went cold.
Pretty quickly.
However, I remained.
In pretty regular contact.
With amanda.
Sometimes her theories.
About what may have happened.
To her mother.
You just don't know.
Where to turn next.
You don't know what to do,
And you feel this guilt.
To put up more money.
For a reward.
Still nothing.
We still did not hear anything.
You really hope that maybe she's.
Living in a cult somewhere.
You come up with every.
Reason that she's fine.
She's just not here,
But she's fine,
And that's how you go.
To sleep at night.
Around the anniversary.
Of lynda's disappearance,
Amanda and her sister.
Contact a television talk show.
And request a reading from the.
Program's wellknown psychic.
Will generate new leads.
[ Woman speaking indistinctly,
[ Muffled ]
To magically tell us.
Where our mom is,
But it put her picture out.
There so it wasn't forgotten.
I thought it was a good idea.
Any clue at all would be.
Awesome, 'cause we knew nothing.
The psychic said something like,
"M.J. Came to the door,
And she left willingly."
She said that she was in.
A psychiatric ward in florida.
The psychic told amanda.
That her mother was alive,
And that she was most likely.
Near a body of water.
I was skeptical,
But I didn't discourage her.
To try to find this out herself.
After the psychic.
Reading, we were thinking,
"There is hope."
She's out there somewhere,
"And she's going to come home."
I called every psychiatric ward.
They can't tell you anything.
So all's you can do is tell them.
Who you're looking for.
And tell them something.
That you want to say to them.
And then they post it.
On a board,
And then you just have to wait.
A lot of waiting.
Say hi to daddy.
Hi, jasmine!
There has to be a certain point.
Where you have children,
And you can't just.
Stop your life.
Hey, dad!
I think that's.
The hardest part, though,
Is 'cause you.
Do feel this guilt.
You're kind of moving on,
Even though you're.
Really not moving on,
But you do kind of feel...
Like you are.
On easter morning,
Almost two years.
After her mother went missing,
Amanda is at home.
With her children.
When she gets.
A shocking phone call.
But it's not about her mom.
David went out to go.
Get easter baskets,
And we were supposed to go.
To his family's house.
So the kids and I.
Were getting ready,
And, the next thing I knew,
His mom is calling me...
Hello?
And said, "What is going on?"
- And I was like, - "What are you talking about?"
And she's like, "David's on."
The news and just got arrested."
On march 30, 2002,
Amanda repasky.
Is stunned to learn.
That her husband, david,
Has just been arrested.
Hello?
David is charged with criminal.
Trespassing and burglary, 1 of 10 people arrested.
In a major burglary ring.
These were 10 men.
In their mid-to late20s.
They would go down.
Through roofs.
They would steal safes,
Any money they could get,
To the tune of more than.
Half a million dollars.
It was just shocking that.
That's what you chose to do,
Is go and burglarize.
Someone's house.
I was just so confused.
You walking me?
David tended.
To live two lives...
And then at night, he was out.
With his friends.
Committing burglaries,
Robberies,
Or spending the money.
From those crimes.
All right.
Let's get some names.
David admits to the crimes,
And, over the next year,
He works as an informant.
And gives up the names.
Of his entire burglary crew,
Including his best friend,
D.J. Wall.
He was not going to go.
To prison for a robbery.
Even if it meant telling.
On his lifelong friend.
D.J. Wall and the others.
To save his own skin.
D.J. And another member.
Of their crew, doug hubbard,
Are arrested and charged with.
Multiple counts of burglary.
I believe they all knew.
That david had informed on them.
Doug hubbard started.
To come unglued.
And was implying.
That david had done.
Something serious.
That we were unaware of.
D.J. Was more stoic.
And told doug to shut up.
I could tell by d.J.'s reaction.
That whatever.
He knew about david.
Was significant.
I don't know, at that point,
If we had thought.
That this might be.
About lynda mcclelland,
But in the days after, there.
Was speculation about this.
Hey, d.J. How you doing?
When we confronted him.
With the possibility.
That he had information.
Regarding lynda.
Mcclelland's death...
You know what I think?
His initial reaction.
Was to, break down in tears.
D.J. Wall told us.
That he received a call.
From dave repasky.
In the early morning hours.
Dave needed his help.
When he entered the home,
He found the body.
Of lynda mcclelland.
On the living room floor.
D.J. Wall's account.
Was that dave told him.
That he had gone.
To lynda's house,
That he had been drinking.
His words were,
"One thing led to another,."
And that he and lynda mcclelland.
Had sexual relations.
David told d.J. That he had.
Been having an affair.
With lynda mcclelland.
He said
Lynda then threatened dave,
Stating something.
Along the lines of,
"Now she's going to.
Leave you for good."
Apparently lynda was.
Going to tell amanda.
You're done.
According to d.J.,
Dave became upset about this.
And punched lynda.
Lynda then fell to the ground,
And then dave choked lynda.
With his hands.
And when dave saw that lynda.
Was still alive and moving,
He then stepped on lynda's neck,
Eventually killing her.
According to d.J.,
Dave had called him.
To help him dispose of the body.
He asked d.J. If he.
Would start digging a grave.
For lynda's body.
They settled on a property.
That was adjacent to d.J. Wall's.
Grandmother's house.
When they unloaded her.
From the vehicle,
He told me that david.
Was standing in the grave,
That he held her.
And said to her, "I'm sorry,".
And covering her up.
I can only speculate.
That david miscalculated.
And figured that d.J. Would not.
Tell on him about the murder,
Because then d.J. Would be.
Incriminating himself.
In a homicide.
D.J. Wall agrees to show police.
Where the body is buried.
Lynda's body was eventually.
Recovered in that wooded area.
The location of her body,
The cause and manner.
Of her death.
Was corroborated by his story.
The day that I found out.
That she wasn't missing anymore,
Detective opferman called me,
And...
He said, "I'm going to find."
Your mom for you today,
"And dave killed her."
It still sends chills down me.
Every time
I think about that day.
On march 17, 2003,
David repasky is charged.
With the murder of his.
Motherinlaw, lynda mcclelland.
Was possibly one of the worst.
Days of my entire life.
She never just walked off.
She had never been missing.
None of that was true.
I never suspected.
That my husband killed my mom.
I never for a minute.
Thought it was him.
He was my best friend.
Still at this point,
And he watched me.
Really go through a lot of pain.
And miss my mom.
I just don't understand.
How you can watch someone.
That you supposedly care about.
Go through so much pain.
As for david's motive,
Lynda's loved ones believed.
She had learned about.
David's secret life of crime.
There is no way.
That my sister would have had.
No way.
If anything, she was going.
To call the police that night.
Because of what he was doing.
Was going to harm them.
At david's trial.
For firstdegree murder,
He maintains his innocence.
And never takes the stand.
His best friend, d.J. Wall,
Is the lead witness.
For the prosecution.
And if you looked.
At david's face...
It was like he knew.
Everything before he said it.
That was the day that I knew for.
Sure that dave killed my mom,
By watching his reaction,
His lack of reaction.
In march of 2004, david repasky.
Is found guilty of murder.
And sentenced to life in prison.
When he said "Guilty,"
I was relieved.
Soon after david repasky was.
Arrested on burglary charges,
Amanda and her children move to
Indiana to be closer to her dad.
It's taken years to put.
Their lives back together.
And reconnect with the rest.
Of her mom's family.
I think that dave took.
A lot from us,
But he didn't ruin our lives.
You were like this tall.
I grew a little bit.
You did grow a little bit.
Me and my kids are happy,
And I wanted that for them.
I didn't want this to be them.
I just want people to know,
Really, how great lynda was.
There's two more.
There's one down there, too.
She was a great sister,
A better mother,
And a perfect grandma.
Whoowhoo!
She did not deserve to die.
Because of dave repasky.
We miss her still.
