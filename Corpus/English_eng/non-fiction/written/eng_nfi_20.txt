[Ezekiel] Dear Yale admissions board:
My name is Ezekiel Figuero.
From the outside looking inside at my bonafides, one could say I'm duality personified.
By day, I'm a senior at South Bronx High.
But by night, I'm known to rock the mic.
♪ Yo, yo, MC Books in the building Slipped in cleverly ♪
♪ So deadly Plus the flow's heavenly ♪
Too conceited.
Doesn't elicit sympathy.
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."
Dickens' opening to A Tale of Two Cities is an apt assessment of my love life this past year.
♪ Oh ♪
- ♪ Come set me free ♪ - ♪ Oh ♪
[Ezekiel] On the one hand, my girl became a disco star and I love her.
But on the other, everybody damn else loves her, too.
Too glamorous.

Give them that hood shit.
All that intellectual yearning and shit.
All right.
To grow up in the ghetto is to wrestle daily with dichotomy and duality.
For example, I'm an orphan, half black and half Puerto Rican.
And these shoes I put feet in and the place that I'm seated ain't where I'm sleeping.
Where I break bread and at night lay my head... you might wake up dead.
- [siren wails]

But I'm not just Bronx.
I'm Manhattan also, see?
And I wonder, when they look, what my coworkers make of me.
- Mayor Koch, he only saw half.

Voice of the ghetto is what he sold me as.
This right here is the future of the South Bronx.
So, I think it's fitting that a future leader of the South Bronx gets to do the honors.
Come.
Come on, sweetheart.

- Thank you.

[audience applauding]
[Ezekiel] But look closely, Yale, past tragedy.
Because my home... is fucking magic.

No, I know.

I need a date.
What you doing later on?

This is strictly business.
[Ezekiel] My best friend Shaolin Fantastic is a fucking fantastic drug dealer.
[sniffs]
And also, he's a lady-killing romantic, too.
["For the Love of Money" playing]
[Cadillac snapping fingers]
Mm-hmm.
[Ezekiel] Back when we first met, he was just a foot soldier
- and mostly I turned my shoulder.

- But looking away is getting untenable.

'Cause nowadays Shaolin, he's like Superfly bred with a five-star general.

Typical cookie-cutter, banal douche-meister.

Oh, thank you... but I got plans.
Ugh.

You've always got plans.

- Thank you so much.

Bye.
Oh, my God.
Sorry about that.
I understand why you're upset.
'Cause when they asked on TV last night if you had a boyfriend, you said no?
[sighs] Zeke, that was for publicity, okay?

Obviously to who?
If you my girl, quit signing autographs and looking at the clock.
Have lunch with me like you said you would.
Don't try and control me like everybody else does, okay?
Just don't.
Oh, and by the way, if you wanted everyone to know I had a man, you should have been there last night.
I had my own show to do.
Zeke, you perform at a drug den owned by gangsters, okay?
That's a different kind of show.
I could have really used your support last night.
You're right.

It's like this, uh...

Like, two sides to every story.
Three sides, actually, if you wanna include the truth.
I apologize for the interruption, but we're gonna be late.
Thought you said I had 20 minutes.
Wait, 20 minutes?
Where you going?
Who the fuck are you?
Shane Vincent, AR.
Lucky man.

- Yeah, except on TV.

Look, I really gotta get Mylene to a photo shoot for Tiger Beat.
Why didn't you tell me?
Not her fault.

Look, we got the check.
Here's money for a cab, and if you want, why don't you come by set later?
These things take forever.

[softly] I'm sorry.
- Give you two a minute.

Come on.
Zeke.
Come to my Tiger Beat shoot after your internship.

My dad's got some big meeting tonight with the church, so I'll be alone.
Kiss me.
In public?
What will your fans think?
- Fine.

Promise me you'll come?
I promise.

[Claudia] Hey, Ezekiel.
So, do you think Congress will pass the Equal Rights Amendment?
[Ezekiel] I don't know.
[Claudia] Apartheid in South Africa, will it ever end?
[Ezekiel] Will it ever end here?
[Claudia] Can Jimmy Carter bring peace to the Middle East?
- [camera shutters clicking] - [Ezekiel] If he pays them enough, maybe.
[Claudia] How did Jim Jones convince so many people to drink poisoned Kool-Aid?
[Ezekiel] America's been drinking the Kool-Aid for 200 years.
[Claudia] What about Sid Vicious, will he go to jail for murder?
- [Ezekiel] Who's Sid?

[Ezekiel] Do you know who Grandmaster Flash is?
- [Claudia] Who?

Do you think there will be a revolution in Iran?
Most likely.
Do you think you can stop being so grumpy?
- Just got things on my mind.

Things.
Bad day?
Colossally.
[chuckles] "Colossally."
- You wanna smoke some primo Thai stick?

Daddy.
I'm coming to bid good night to my mentee and daughter.
Hello, sir.
Look, I don't want you staying here too late, Ezekiel.
Focus on that college essay.

Oh, I am, sir.

Good.

Yale's Dean of Admission.
He's gonna be at the Ivy Club next weekend.

I'd like that.
Put in the hard work now, you earn your place at my alma mater... it's all smooth sailing from there.

Okay then, kids.

- Why you do that?

Chris Stein walked in and Joey Ramone, too.

You know, in a "Big Bird sniffing glue" kind of way.
I'm really into the whole punk scene.
Not just the scene, but the whole philosophy.
- What else you got?

I like Khalil Gibran...
Jesus, sometimes, and, uh...

Goodbye, punk rock.
And... hello, get down.

Get down part?

Anything you wanna tell me, I really wanna know.
[Lydia] Ever since Mylene went on TV, everything's going so fast.
- Ramon and the board and the bank.

Here you go.
- I should go.

That's good.

It's no trouble.
Un vasito agua.
Okay.

Ramon tells me Gunns is giving you a hard time about
- construction on your housing starting up?

Gunns and those blanquito politicians, they all come up for a photo op of the groundbreaking and then nada.
Like a runaround.
And every time I pass by that empty construction site, it's like a great big sign saying, "Francisco Fuerte... can't do nothing for his people."
"Francisco Fuerte es a pendejo.

Everything good takes time, no?
And no one thinks you're a pendejo.
I don't know.
Pero gracias.
You're welcome.
[Ezekiel] You're talking stripped-down chords.
The drums without the vocals, that's the part I like.
'Cause then my DJ, he plays the same record on two different turntables.
- ["Impeach the President" playing]

And then again.
[mimics beat]
Wait, your DJ?
Uh, it's this guy I know.

[music resumes]
Does he have a name?
Shaolin Fantastic, the Lady Killing Romantic.
[laughs]
But what about his real name?
Uh...
I don't know.
But Shaolin plays the get down part on one record, right?
And right about when it's about to end he goes back to the other record, and then back again.
And then again, and then again, and again, to make one long get down part that never ends.
And that's cool because...?
'Cause you can dance to it.

No.

Yeah.
That's what your parents and boyfriend gotta do.
They need to set you free.
