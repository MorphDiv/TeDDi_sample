Man #2:

Fx presents legion.
Good evening.
We are here tonight to talk about violence.
Or maybe human nature.
We are here to talk about human nature.
Wait.
A quote.
A great philosopher once wrote, "in times of peace, the warlike man attacks himself."
This is the root of all our problems.
And by "this,"
I mean "we."
We are the root of all our problems, our confusion, our anger, our fear of things we don't understand.
Violence, in other words, is ignorance.
Figure your shit out.
That's my--what I'd say.
There are two kinds of stories we tell our children.
The first kind:
Once upon a time, there was a fuzzy little rabbit named frizzy-top who went on a quantum, fun adventure only to face a big setback, which he overcame through perseverance and by being adorable.
This kind of story teaches empathy.
Put yourself in frizzy-top's shoes, in other words.
The other kind:
Oliver Anthony bird, if you get too close to that ocean, you'll be sucked into the sea and drowned!
This kind of story teaches them fear.
And for the rest of their lives, these two stories compete.
Empathy and fear.
And so I bring you tonight's play, a work in five acts about a fuzzy little bunny who got too close to the ocean, and what happened next.
Let us begin.
Syd:

Butfoundonlylies.
thedoctorhaddisappeared.

Thatwasthemission.
Wehadseenthings, heardthings.
Butcouldwe believeour eyes?
CouldDavid?
Woman:

Dr. pooley:

Woman:

Woman:

David,wakeup .
Wakeup.
Odd.
Extremely.
He's gonna wake up, right?
There's no medical reason David's unconscious, if that's what he is.
David:

Cassiopeia.
Syd:

KissingersaysI'mclean.
SoI getto go home.
No!
Syd:

Cary:

No.
Too risky.
Agreed.
Syd:

David,whereareyou ?
You'vegotto getbetter soyoucancomehome too.
David.
Wakeup.
Ptonomy:

Ilooked.
Wherever his mind is, i can't find it.
-But he's not-- -he's not brain-dead, no.
His mind is active.
What's it doing, though?
Ptonomy:

An astral plane.
We have been inside David's memories three times.
Three times, we saw glitches, omissions.
It's as if we've activated some kind of guardian.
There's something in David's memory he does not want us to see.
-Kerry.

Melanie:

In fact, the three of you.
I'm sending you out.
Weneedto findout  exactlywhathappenedtoDavid beforehewenttoclockworks.
Syd:

Melanie:

-He'stooimportant.

'Cause I'm thinking "dangerous" is a better word.
Kerry:

Melanie:

Syd:

Thatwasthemission.
Keep an eye out.
We can't stay long.
Just a guess, but I'd say Dr. poole hasn't been here in a few years.
It's weird...
Seeingitaftervisiting David'smemory.
The curtains are completely different.
Most people's memories are unreliable-- the things we see, that people say.
And they change over time too.
Your past is an illusion.
There was a tear right there.
The wall opened up and a red light came out.
And the boy ran into the closet.
And I followed.
Wait!
Ptonomy:

I looked for you.
You weren't in any memories of David I could find.
Are you saying David created that space?
Ptonomy:

Psychic projection to create a simulated reality.
Okay.
Let's see what she has to say.
Who?
Ptonomy:

There you are.
Objects have memory too.
Is there any way-- could we still be in David's mind?
Ptonomy:

No, this is real.
How do you know?
'Cause I know.
I mean, I'm pretty sure.
How do you-- put your hand here.
Watch it.
I won't touch you.

Just close your eyes.
Man:

Cassiopeia.
Bootes.
Canis major.
Lupus.
Telescopium.
Tell me, David, what did the stars say?
Did he...
Looks like the doctor came back while David was robbing the place.
It doesn't sound like David.
I know you like him, but he's not stable.
Trust me.
Well, you try hearing voices for 10, 15 years, self-medicate with hard drugs, and then get dumped in a loony bin.
I was in a loony bin.
Yeah, but you're--
I mean, no offense, but compared to him, his power, you're a card trick.
I read the report.
He broke the doctor's skull.
Had to put the guy in a coma to get the swelling down.
And that was with his fists.
Imagine if he used his power.
He's a bomb.
-What did the stars say?

Dr. poole asked David, "what did the stars say?"
And I saw him when we were in his mind, just before the monster came.
I saw him, like a flash.
He had--he was stuffing tape into his mouth, audio tape.
And his hands were...
-Are you saying-- -glitches.
Omissions.
You've seen his memories.
There are rips in them, gaps.
What if--
I've seen implanted memories before.
You can always tell.
Implanted from the outside.
I'm talking about-- he's so powerful, David.
Maybe he's hidden his real memories behind fake ones.
Why?
I don't know.
Lot of effort just to convince yourself your boyfriend's a nice guy.
Conversation's on tape.
What did the stars say?
I know he's hiding things.
Onelastjob,and we'reout.
What if he didn't come in here to steal a radio or some coins?
Bigscorepotential.
What if he came here to get rid of evidence?
A conversation, the one time he said too much.
Syd:

Thethingshe 'dsaid.
Whoarewe if not thestorieswe tellourselves?
Hello.
Who's that?
Kissinger:

I exist!
I'm in a cell!
We should speak quietly.
They might-- might be listening.
Who?
Tell me your name.
Amy... haller.
My god.
The sister.
Who are you?
My name is kissinger.

David's doctor.
I went to the hospital to look for you.
They said you didn't exist.
I do.
Well, I used to.
Have they-- did you tell them where he is?
No.
I don't know.
I haven't seen him since-- did you?
No.
After he left the hospital, he stayed with us for a few nights, but--
Did you know...
He wasn't sick?
That--that he had powers?
Kissinger:

Didyou?
I think so.
I should have.
Foryears, doctors,hospitals.
God,hewassosweet.
Buthe--hemoved.
From room to room, sometimes further.
You'd heard his voice, and you'd follow it.
Hewouldn'tbe there.
Andheknewthings, conversations he couldn't have heard.
More than conversations-- thoughts.
I'dcatchhimtalking topeoplewhoweren'tthere.
"Who are you talking to?"
And he would say, "king."
The dog.
Yourdog.
Davidspokeof himoften.
Amy:

We didn't have a dog.
David:

Youwillnotfeelthesame aboutme.
Woman:
Cary called, he found an address for Philly.
Hey, Syd.

Cary called, found an address for the girlfriend.
Ex-girlfriend.
Mm-hmm.
So you live...
Inside his body.
We share.
Is that weird?
I'll tell you a story.
Ray and Irma whitecloud.
They're having their first kid, and it's a girl.
Native girl.
They decide to name her kerry.
Cary:

Ray decides Irma had an affair.
He leaves her, so now Irma's a single mother raising this bastard runt.
Then eight years later, little boy Cary wakesupin hisroom.
Kerry:

Soforthenextyear , he thinks maybe he made her up, like his imaginary friend who comes and goes, but...
Cary:

Shelivesinsideofhim...
Cary and kerry:

Twopeoplein onebody.
Syd:

What about you?
What do you mean?
You're a person too, with feelings.
I'm...
Asking what it's like for you.
Okay, he does the boring stuff, okay?
Eating, sleeping, whatever it is you guys do in the bathroom.
And I get all the action.
He makes me laugh, and I keep him safe.
If that's weird...
I'm okay with it.
Man:

Melanie:

Syd:

We'llgetthefacts.
Melanie:

Cary:

You sure?
It's not just coincidence with David gone.
Maybe he's waking up.
Maybe, but don't get your hopes up.
We've been wrong before.
Do you miss her?
Kerry?
Is that dumb?
No.
It'ssweet.
Itstillamazesme howsheonlyages whenshe'soutsideyourbody .
Cary:

What happens to her when I die, I wonder?
Is he...
He's still here.
His body.
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
Oliver?
It's me.
Man:

Unannounced visitor.
Unannounced visitor.

Unannounced visitor.
Unannounced visitor.

Unannounced- what was it?

I told you we need to replace this operating system.
No.
He's trying to reach us.
We can hear you, my love.
Come back to us.
Man:

Unannouncedvisitor.
Unannouncedvisitor.

Unannouncedvisitor.
Unannounced--
Wait.
Drink?
Uh...
Sure.
What's real in this space is whatever you want it to be.
So my feeling is why not wait in style?
Wait for what?
Where are we?
Sorry about the cold.
It's the only thing i can't seem to fix in here.
Oh, would you like to listen to something?
Uh...
Torrent downloaded from RARBG
that's, um... hey, dig that groove.
Oh, it's genius.
Can you--
can you turn it off?
sorry.
I forgot about your, um...
I had a similar...
Proclivity?
Malady.
I forget the word.

I've been here a long time, and things tend to, uh...
Drift.
Right.
And here is...
See, I would-- they gave me a shot, a sedative for the memory work, and when I woke up, I was...
Unless I'm not really awake.
Maybe this is the drug.
Tell me something.
Do they still-- is free love still a thing?
Girls in summer dresses with no bra?
Y...

It's definitely-- bras are back.
Oh.
Too bad.
So...
Oh, yes, right.
Well, there's good news and there's bad news.
The bad news is it's not the drug.
You're here in the astral plane.
You went too far into the make-believe and got lost-- your mind, consciousness.
And now you're trapped in this no-place, where every day is the same, where you can imaginify yourself a kingdom but nothing is ever real.
And what's the good news?
I'm not alone anymore.
How do you feel about beat poetry?
"I went to the neon fruit supermarket,
"dreaming of your enumerations.
"What peaches and what penumbras.
"Whole families shopping at night.
"Aisles full of husbands,
"wives in the avocadoes, babies in the tomatoes."
Uh, sir?
Oh, Oliver, please.
Don't worry.
He can't get you in here.
"He"?
Your monster.
Ah.
He makes you forget.
Clever.
What are you--
Oliver:

Like I said, I've seen it before.
I was schizophrenic, I thought.
But Melanie said it was because of my powers.
Melanie.
I knew a Melanie once.
You know what?
I got to get out of here, back to the-- they need me.

Oliver:

-How do you-- Oliver:

It's waiting.
The monster.
You brought it in here, and now it's hunting you.
There is no monster.

I know that.

It's my psychology.
Oliver:

I like it.

It's part of you;

But not like a symptom.
More like a...
Parasite.
What are you saying?

No, that's superstition.

I'm saying maybe it's good you're here.
Figure some things out.
Defeat the dragon.
Unless, you know, the dragon wins.
Listen, I can't just-- people need me.
Syd and Amy.
So I am gonna get out of this place.
I am not waiting.
-How?

But apparently, I'm this super-powerful mutant, so I'm guessing I'll figure something out.
Pity.
Two more and we could have had a barbershop quartet.
Right.
I'll watch for you as best I can, but things get muddy out there in the vast subconscious.
Remember, it's not real unless you make it real.
come back any time.
Wednesday's karaoke night.
Syd:

Weweretheghosts ina hauntedhouse, thegolemof myth.
Tothenormal, wewerejustsuperstition, make-believe.
Sometimesitfelt likethatto us too.

Whatwasreal?
Theoldgirlfriend, thatwasthemission.
Ptonomy:

Scan her?
I'll look through her memories while you keep her busy.
I need 30 to 40 minutes.
How am I supposed to keep her busy for 30 to 40 minutes?
Buy a house.
If you see anything, just whistle.
There's gonna be some fighting soon, right?
To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence.
Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
Whatever.
Oh...
And I'm blind.
Woman:

Kids.

Oh, wow.

No, no, no.
No, we're not having kids.
It's just, uh, we're talking.
Oh, well, you don't get 'em just by talking.
So I know it's a stretch of our price range, but we were thinking about something on the West Side.
Great.
Youwantto takealook  atsomeplaces?
more coffee?
Oh, no.
I've got a hard enough time sleeping as it is.
Woman:

He's always tossing and turning, and sometimes he talks in his sleep.
We don't have to-- it's not a session.
He's right.
But I would like to hear more about this dog you guys are thinking of getting.
His name's Archie.
David had a beagle when he was a kid.
King.

He went with me, like, everywhere.
Woman:

I keep asking for pictures, but...
Amy must have some.

"A lot"?

No pictures, no favorite Teddy bear, no evidence he was ever-- you know...
Had a past.
Evidence he was ever-- you know...
Had a past.
So you want to take a tour?
No, thanks.
I think we've found what we're looking for.
I'm sorry.

Did you date someone named David?
Syd.
Are you friends of his?
Do you know where he is?
No, we...
We're looking for him, actually.
But I just wanted you to know he said such nice things about you.
Did he...
Did things end badly with you guys?
It's--
I thought I could fix him.
He was so troubled, you know.
He was always nice to me.
But then he went off his medication, and he had this friend, Benny.
Syd:

Woman:

Pusher, I guess?
Wait, so David's friend, the one he did drugs with...
Unhand the reptile.
Hey, now, don't fight.
Was a man?
Yeah, a big guy.
Smiled a lot, but not with his eyes.
If I see him, is there anything that you want to say?
A message?
Tell him...
They're watching.
Syd:

Ptonomy:

Everywhere we went, it was David and Lenny, his old female friend from the hospital.
Who I buried in a wall, so did she end up stitched in David's memory?
This would be an awesome place to have a fight.
Ptonomy:

David's memory replaced the real dude with Lenny.
Helicopters coming in, gunships, ninjas on fast ropes.
Why?
I don't know.
Let's ask the doctor.
Syd:

Whichonewasreal?
Orweretheyone and the same?
Amanwhobecameawoman ?
Ormaybeit wasjust anillusion.
Dr. poole, we're here about David haller.
I don't talk about my patients.
Please.
He's in trouble.
He told us that he broke into your office to steal things so that he could buy drugs.
We think there's another story.
Doctor, five minutes, and you'll never see us again.
I swept upstairs.

Same drill.
You talk.

No, it's-- we're not spies.
If he's willing to talk, let's let him talk.
Thank you.
Of course.
So you're a lighthouse keeper now.
I'd like to think I was always a lighthouse keeper.
How long did you treat David?
Dr. poole:

Why off?
Dr. poole:

When David was on his medication, he was open, almost desperate to work.
But when he went off it-- what about drugs or booze?
He had conflicting impulses, good and bad.
There was a friend.
A man or woman?
A man.
Benny.
He had, I'd say, a negative effect on David's treatment.
Was he different at all, David?
Before the break-in?

He doubled his sessions.
It was clear that there were things he wanted to say but couldn't until his last appointment.
Syd:

What did the stars say?
You're in love with him.
Yes.
I'd very much like to see David again.
Could you take me to him?
Why?
Because I have the same question you do.
I had a wife, kids.
Now I can't see out of one eye.
I can't concentrate.
He ruined my life.
I just want to ask him why.
so he's in charge.
Nobody's in charge.
We're here together.
And Melanie bird?
Is she not the leader of your little band?
Syd:

it's a trap.
-shit.

all day, it's talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
My turn.
we've been looking for you.
that was a mistake.
Sir?
Target's acquired.
-The other?

It's a trick.
He's not--
Throw them in the vehicle.
I'll take them back myself.
Lenny:

Youthinkyou'resafehere , withtheseclowns, dreamingyou're amountainclimber?
Look, it's your little room.
I am not in the mood.
Whoopsee.

kid.
Hey, kid!
Are you my friend?
'Cause I could really use-- yes, of course I'm your friend.
Come on.
It's just I'm Betsy tough love, your mean friend.
But don't worry;

Blow me.
I don't swing that way, bro.
But I could be talked into a circle jerk-- that is, if you can get it up in this place.
Walking around, looking for an exit like an idiot.
All those years of practice, and now, whoo, mission complete.
I lost my mind.
Yeah, well, you screwed up, kid.
I told you not to trust them, okay?
I mean, what kind of a name is summerland?
You know, you let your guard down, man.
They gave you a shot, and now we're here.
No, he said it wasn't the drugs.
Who, captain Nemo in his giant ice cube?
Man:
Come on, man, they doped you up and kicked you out of your own body to do who knows what.
Uncle fiddly with the glasses and the angry girl inside him, they could be fingering you right now.
Who are you, really?
I'm you.
I'm me.
please.
The truth.
Here's the truth, pal.
We got to get out of here, okay?
You and me, 'cause wherever you go, there I am.
And I can't hang out in this shit-stain no-place much longer, okay?
I got things to do.
What does that mean?
So I was thinking.
If you just concentrate, or if together, maybe we...
Hey.
Or maybe you need a little more motivation.
-Wait, is that-- -that's right.
In the real world, that guy is about to shank your girlfriend.
-No.

-No.

-Oh, no.

Lenny:

Come on!
Syd!
Syd!
Syd.
It's okay.

It's okay.
We were looking for you.
I know.

Here, hold this.

Oh!
Run.
I'll protect you.

Grab her!
No!
David!
Run!
No, it's me!
David.
woman:

Don't touch me!
Legion.

Was it alive?

Take an hour of his time.
Wow.

Someone's been busy.
Clearly not in ours.

Yeah.
I forget your back is always bad this time of year.
Only when there are leaves--
