*BLACKLIST* Season 04 Episode 17 "Requiem"
Kathryn Nemec.
Your references are outstanding.
Fluent in Italian, French, German, and Russian.
Most of your charges appear to have been in various diplomatic corps.
I enjoy travel.
You attended medical school at Northwestern, yet you decided not to continue.

Human anatomy was my Waterloo.
- The cadavers...

No.

Much more interesting than our living patients.
I decided it will be healthier to reorient my efforts from the end of life to its beginning.
Thus a Master's degree in Child Development.
There's no vocation more critical than raising a child.
It's my belief one can't be overqualified.
This job will not be without its challenges.
I have no interest in abdicating my role as a mother.
While I'm in this house,
I will be responsible for tending to Masha's needs.
You and Masha will join me whenever you can.
There will be times I need to be... unencumbered.
So my primary duty will be to care for the child.
- When I'm gone, yes.

You will have one job, and that is to discreetly observe our interactions.
During my absences, I will expect you to provide a continuity of care.
The way I dress her, hold her, change her, bathe her.
You will be what I am to her... with one exception.
Yes?
You will not love her.
You are safe.
You are loved.
[ Whispers ] You are wise.
[ Bag thuds ]
How many children have you raised?
I've seen seven children through their elementary years.
Some of them siblings, of course.
What do you feel toward them now?
Pride, mostly.
You wanna know if I loved them?
They were never mine to love.
But I would've died for each and every one of them.
What must a child do to earn this eternal devotion of yours?
Not much.
Take Masha, for instance.
We have a pact, she and I.
Every time she takes a bottle from me or falls asleep in my arms, she's telling me that she trusts me completely.
That is a profound gift.
I would do anything to protect your baby.

Yes.

We couldn't continue the way we were.

So... what he... he... he stole Masha to hurt you?
No, that's not it.
He thinks she's his.

That man set off a chain reaction that took everything I loved from me.
And not just me.

And for what?

He's a traitor.
I have nothing to say to him, and I don't wanna hear anything he has to say to me.
Yes, you do.

What kind of danger?
You'd have to ask him.
And there's something he wants to ask you.

I don't know you.
I'm not as unknown as you might like to believe, Ms. Nemec.
We shared the affection of Katarina.
We have a common bond in Elizabeth.
I presume your love for the child abides.
After Katarina's sudden departure,
I felt a responsibility to watch over the girl from a distance.
I've provided for her and Sam financially.
I'm surprised you found the time, between selling illegal services or ordering hits on anyone who got in your way.
I make no apologies for who I am or what I do.
Katarina was a traitor to two countries, both global superpowers.
God willing, Katarina's daughter will live a private life of quiet courage.
But if anyone learns her identity, the only way I can stop the threats from rising is to rise up as a greater threat than all of them.
So you want me to join you in organized crime to protect Elizabeth.
Yes, Kate.
Help me protect the girl we love.
And what do I have that you could possibly want?
A trusted voice.
A cool head.
Undaunted initiative in a messy situation.

You know how to engender loyalty in others, Kate.
You always have.

I realize now I was so wrapped up in helping you build your empire, I lost sight of why I joined you in the first place.
Somewhere along the way, I stopped serving Liz's needs to enable yours.
They're one and the same.

What we've done, we've done for her.
I believe that, Raymond.
Like a Pied Piper, you made me believe.
But when I did what I thought was best for her...
It wasn't best.
You almost got her killed, and you betrayed me.
No.

When you hired me, you told me to choose Elizabeth over you.
And so I tried to help her disappear to a safe place with her newborn daughter.
And for that, you put me down like a mad dog.
For the last two decades of my life, you had me convinced
I was helping keep Elizabeth safe.
But in reality, I was helping you become a monster.
It's time for us to meet and talk.
No, Raymond.
I'm gonna do what I should've done years ago.
I took a bullet to my head, but I remember what my father taught me.
Our stories are written in flesh.
And I'm gonna use that lesson to render you powerless.

Impossible to penetrate.

Pity the poor foot soldier who made it that far.
The architecture of my organization has risen stone by stone over decades.
You can't get inside to hurt me, Kate.
You forget I was by your side the whole time.
I know what was required to amass your power, who you hurt, who you betrayed, who you killed.
More importantly, as your cleaner,
I know where the bodies are buried.
Were buried, dearie.
And I'm going to use them and the stories they tell to put you in the ground.
