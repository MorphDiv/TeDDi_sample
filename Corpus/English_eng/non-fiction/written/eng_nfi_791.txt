Previously on "Somewhere Between"...
The killer called your show.

Then the next day in Black Pine Cove, they...
Oh, my God.
For one to live, one must die.
Mommy's coming, angel.
I came back to eight days before.
Is it really you?
Sometimes it's like you're asleep and something wakes you up.
Who did your brother was responsible for Susanna's death?
- I killed her!

No.

The man who's been killing those women in the city, he's going to drown my little girl.
I need your help to catch him.
- We saved her.

Come on!
Officer!

I need your help!

He's gonna try and kill me!

What...
Who are you?
_
Where are you?
Can we talk about it when I get home?
Is Serena okay?
What the hell, Laura?
Just tell me.

Well, you lied to me.

Daddy...

Hey, what's, uh... what's bothering you, honey?
Nothing.

What's that?
Oh, it's just an old thing I'm giving away to a thrift store.
I'll talk to you later.
You know what?
I... am gonna sing you a song.
- No daddy singing!

It'll be so terrible you'll fall asleep just to get away from it.
Or run.
So, someone else comes along, just by coincidence, runs into Fiona and stabs her 20 times?
Look, obviously he's a killer.

The question is catching him and proving it, and you are not helping.
On top of assaulting one of my men.
But we'll leave that aside.
So... you can tell us how you knew what you knew or I can detain you for obstruction.
Article 1 Section 2B of the California Constitution says all kinds of things about press and immunity.
You want me to pull that up for you?
If he kills another girl, and you knew something that could help her, you can forget obstruction...
I will nail you for complicity.
After you.

Why don't we try the truth?
'Cause I can't help Serena from a psych ward.
So who does he kill tonight?
Nobody claimed the body.

They found the body in a dumpster in the Financial District.
Maybe we scared him off.
Want to count on that?
She was wearing a blue wig, and this fuzzy jacket, short, to here.
We found a napkin in her pocket.
No name.

Cerberus.

You know your mythology.
I know my underworld.
Could be an unlisted gentleman's club she worked out of.
Cops never found it.
Kinda people that go to that kinda club don't usually talk to the cops.
Yeah, but they talk to you.
- They talk to people that talk to me.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Whoa.

You recall the time of death?
No.
The next time I'm headed for a rewind, I'll take better notes.
So what's the plan?
You call me when you find the three-headed dog, we go there, and we wait.
What?
That wasn't too shabby, when you stabbed him with the pen.
A lot of good it did.
First time, they found her in the dumpster.
The second time, he left her in an alley.
We moved the needle on fate.
So this time Serena drowns in a lake instead of the bay?
Dear Mrs. Price.
I'm writing to you as one mother to another.
Ruby told me that you work for the news.
Please put something on your show about my Danny.
He is innocent.
The articles in this envelope will show you that people with the syndrome my son has are not violent.
Think how you would feel if your little girl was going to die.
Please open your heart.
Sincerely, Grace Jackson.
There are more unlisted clubs in this city than there are men who moisturize!
If anybody could find the hypodermic needle in that haystack...
Just where I love going.
Back to the swamp you hauled me out of.
- Afraid of old enemies?

Old friends.
Where are you headed, while I'm hunting three-headed dogs?
I'm going to make sure I don't squander my second chance.
I didn't lie to you.
I was in the field, following a tip on that story I'm doing about the killer.
It got late and, uh, things got crazy.
Mm.

I know all about crazy.
I'm worried.
When's the last time you saw your therapist?
I don't know.
Uh...
Too long.
- Promise me you'll go see her.

Mostly I just need to get rest.
I'm gonna stay in today and snuggle with Serena.
You are?

That's right, angel.
We can curl up and see what the Mad Hatter's up to.
You're staying home from work to read with me?
Until I have to go out later on to work on my story.
Are you feeling all right?
Hey, Ruby!
- Move over.

Why'd you come to my school?
I missed ya.
What's got you down, sweetheart?
I'm not allowed to see my friend.

Yeah, me too.
If I was Elsa, I would make a blizzard over the whole jail and I would turn all the guards into snowmen and my dad and I, we would skate away on the ice, and I'd bring him back to my palace
where no one would ever find us.
But I'm not Elsa.
It's just me and I have 16p11.2 deletion syndrome which makes me trip all the time.
Okay!

Well, that was quick.
I'll see you soon, okay?
My uncle Nico came to see me, Mr. DeBray.
He missed me so he came to see me.
Oh, that's wonderful, Ruby.
Nice to meet you, Uncle Nico.
Pleasure's mine.
Hey.

Goodbye, Elsa.
Susanna was strangled before she was stabbed, with the scarf she was wearing.
There were yellow silk fibers in the wounds on her neck.
Uh, is my son's DNA on the scarf too?
Like you say it is on the knife?
We don't know.

- Of course it is.

If you find that scarf, you'll find the real killer.
You cops have all the time in the world to scare him into confessing, but the... the murder weapon?
"Sorry, ma'am, it's missing."
Serena!

Hold the fort for a sec?
I'll be right back.
Okay?
Ow.
♪ My angel is halfway to dreamland ♪
♪ My angel is drifting asleep ♪
♪ My angel is halfway to dreamland ♪
♪ So don't make a sound or a peep ♪
Did you find it?
Jenny rocks the world.
The napkin is from Hounds of Hell.
A discreet club in the Financial District where the unpardonable do the unspeakable with the unmentionable.
Sounds like your kind of place.
Hey...
There's this thing that killers do.
They kill people.
And?
You know how much you want Serena alive?
That's close to how much she wants you alive.
Let me go alone.
No way.
Like Marjorie said, for one to live, one has to die.
I'll meet you in 10 minutes.
Hey...
I just got her to sleep, so... loud noises are punishable by guillotine.
Yeah.
What's that?
Uh, persistent citizen.
I have to go into work.
We're doing research on victim number six.
- Six?

Sorry.

I just...

I just got, um... killer on the brain.
You look handsome.
You're beautiful.
Mm.
I wish I could stay.
Yeah, me too.
Be safe.
I'll try.
Hello, daughter unit.
- Hello, father unit.

Aww.

I'm sorry to wake you up, but turns out I need that yellow scarf after all.
And I'm wondering if you've seen it.
- Yes!

I wanted to play with it, but it had all these yucky stains on it, so I washed it all clean.
You did.
Okay.
Let's, uh...

There we go.
Love you.
Here.

What's the range on this thing?
Somewhere around global.
Okay.

Fire?
Oh, my God!
She could be in there!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Wait!

You can't run into a fire!
Help me!

Help me!

Who are you?
Why are we back here?
Because you're in danger.
What are you doing?

There's no fire.

He did that to keep us from stopping him.
What are you talking about?

We're with the police.
We have information someone's planning on hurting you tonight.
Did you arrange to meet a man here?
What... prove you're the police.
Well, you can believe us...
Or you can end up in the news, like the last five girls.
Are you meeting someone here tonight?

Yeah.

A guy called and asked me if I would be here tonight.
How'd he get your number?
If a guy wants my number, he knows how to get it.
That's his caller ID.
Put it on speaker.
Hello?
Hey, Mimi.

How about you meet me at Hey Venus in a half an hour?
Yes.
Sure.

Now what?
He wants to meet his date at Hey Venus.
Well... that's where she's gonna be.
What, you're just gonna throw her out there like bait?
No.
We're not doing this on our own.
What is it?
You have a minute to catch a killer?
Actually, it's, uh... it's occupied.
Wow.
You should call for backup.
I can handle myself.
It's not you I'm worried about.
Let's go get him.
You're all insane.
Yeah.

Which I am not signing on to until you tell me what you know and how you know it.
Fine.
I lived through an alternate timeline in which my daughter was drowned by the man who's killing these women.
It was so excruciatingly horrible that I killed myself, but instead of dying, this guy fished me out and I woke up a week before I lost my daughter.
That's why I know what I know.
- Because...

- Yeah.

'Cause people that fall through the time-space continuum, they gotta stick together, you know?
Oh, I could arrest you both right now for so many things.
But first, let's get this guy when he shows up at Hey Venus.
Well, you had your hands on the killer last night, which is more than I can say for any of us.
Thank you.
We are no more than 10 feet from you every second.
Yes.
Come on.

I want you to take Mimi home.
I'm sure the Captain has officers she can throw on that.
I only trust you.

We can't change anything if we don't keep her alive.
Be careful.
You too.
Any idea why a killer would put you on his list?
Maybe he's my fairy god mother granting a wish.
Come on.

Don't worry, I don't have the guts yet.
Give me two years.
That's when he's gonna be old enough to come looking for me.
It's better that I'm gone.
He can live his life thinking I was some poor college student who wanted him to have a better life.
Instead of a party girl who didn't have the guts to take him on.
- 16?

Yeah...
I have a niece that's gonna be 14.
- Does she like sweaters?

There's... this stupid thing that I do
- every year on his birthday.

Here's this year's.

I usually give it to a thrift store.
You made that yourself?
The only thing I learned from my mom.
That and how to let a man light your cigarette.
Take it.

It's very beautiful.

Um, did you box somebody in?
I think you're getting towed.
Hey!

D... just... hold on!
Oh, wait, wait, wait!
For downstairs, to get back in.
Take this.
- Lock the door.

Waiting long?
- No.

Police!

She's a hooker!

No stab wound.

Mimi?
_
Mimi?
Nice to meet you, Uncle Nico.
What does this have to do with Ruby?
Everything.

If I get locked up, who's gonna be the man in Ruby's life?
You?
Stay here.
Lost him?
Yeah, but we found each other again.
Life got dull without you.
I loved it.
You're the teacher...

Why are you following me?
How do you always know where I'm going to be?
Hey!

Let me out!
I'm trapped!

Get me out of here!
I'm trapped!

H-Hey, I smell...

Get me out of here!
I got so much work to do!
Please!
You can't win until the price is paid.
For one to live, one must die.
No!

No!

It was for the children!
Let me out!
Please!

Get me out!
Don't kill me!
Please!

No!

It's not the way!

Stop!

Get me out!

Get me out!
Grab my legs!

No!
He has to die!
How could you let him live?
All the women he's killed... and Serena...
Governor's got nothing on you.
He believes in the death penalty.
You believe in do-it-yourself.
You risked your life for a killer.
What's the Ruby connection?
Why Serena?

Caught a good break.
Mimi's alive.
She's in a coma, but she'll pull through.
He didn't kill her?
Did his best.

She fingers him, and...
You hear that?
There's no way out of the noose.
He can't hurt Serena.
You know how my husband became the DA?
By never being sure there was no way out of the noose.
Why am I the one under arrest?
She's the one who attacked me.
Has anybody looked at that?
The EMTs wanted to bandage it, but I told them chicks go crazy over my scars.
Yeah.
Nothing sexier than festering infection.
There's glass and God knows what in there.
Careful.
Hey, just hold still.
You sound like my mother.
Yeah.

Ow.
Serena really drew the long straw when she got you.
The oceans of hell you've had to slog through for her...
Your mother would do the same thing for you.
She would if I was my brother.
Wh...

I, uh...

Uh, Captain...

Mm.

Uh, is the man you're holding the killer?
- All five women?

Good.
Without your wife, we never would've collared him.
Do you need anything more from Mrs. Price?
Nah, she's given her statement, I just need her to sign it.
Good.

We'll get the charges in front of Judge Vasquez before he has his morning coffee.
No leaks to the press until we indict.
- Okay.

- Yes.

Thank you.
- I put the man's brother on death row.

- So what does he want from you?

He was just helping me out with my story, as a private detective.
- It's just a coincidence.

Two days after his mother ambushed me in front of my office.

What kind of story calls for dressing up like a $10 hooker and burning suspects alive in the middle of the night?
We had a chance to catch him, and we caught him.
"We?"
Yeah, me and the police.
And Nico Jackson.
I've had an hour of sleep in three days...
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
I'm worried about you.

You know I'm proud of you.
For helping catch him.
Just make sure he stays caught.
Nothing?

Hm.
Well, silence is your client's right, but you know what silence looks like to a jury.
I can't compel my client to speak.
But I can speak.
And I can tell you that my client has now been attacked, two nights in a row, by the same woman.
He abducted her.
Yes, I understand that she's making that claim.
Which is substantiated only by her own statement.
And yet somehow, you're hoping to pin five murders on my client.
Do you have any other questions for me, Captain?
How many days are we losing you for?
Just until I know Serena's completely recovered from her allergy attack.
Tell Auntie Mara I send her a big hug and a kiss!
Tell her I hear it and I send her one right back.
Come back as soon as you can, okay?
I will.

We're all set, angel.
You, me, and whatever we feel like doing.
But I actually want to go to school today.
We have art, and I haven't finished my diorama yet.
We can make our own dioramas.
Hi.
Uh, we're all set with Vasquez, as soon as we...
Mm-hmm.
What's wrong?
We're on our way.
- Did he escape?

Yeah?
You're not gonna like this.
Well, that's an easy guess.
I don't like anything before 11:00 in the morning.
Not a single chromosome of DeBray's DNA showed up in Mimi's apartment.
What?
Your exact words were "no question whatsoever."
I was going on the information that we had at the time.
And now I have to go in front of a superior-court judge and say yes, Your Honor, there's no physical evidence tying the suspect I've filed charges against to this crime.
Or any of the other murders.
- What about the clothes?

Oh, come on.

It was...

What was he wearing when you arrested him?
Uh... navy shirt.
He took off the jacket while he was running.
We searched every square millimeter between Mimi's place and where he got in the car for the knife.
Not likely we'd miss a bloody jacket.
He could've tossed it in a car.
Did you search every car?
I cannot build a case on could have.
You can build a case on witnesses, Tom.
- Witnesses.

Right.
One's in a coma.
One has admitted to assaulting the suspect.

One was fired from the police for the brutal beating of a citizen.
So either somebody finds a green jacket soaked in the victim's DNA by tonight or I'm calling off the hearing.
Tom, there has to be another way to charge him.
- Charge him?

Once I cancel the hearing for lack of evidence,
I won't have a way to hold him.
He's a trophy keeper.
The team tore this guy's apartment to pieces.
All right, if he had a girl's ring in there, they would've found it.
"The team" couldn't find their own ass with GPS and a bloodhound.
Come on, hermano, all I'm asking for is the code to the lock on Haskell's apartment.
I'm sorry to remind you, but you ain't a cop anymore.
Anything you dig up blows the chain of custody.
Anything I dig up goes right back where I dug it.
And then you get an irresistible hunch, you march in all official-like, you bring home the inculpatory bacon, and you get the honor and glory you so richly deserve.
If you get caught tampering, he walks and you're felons.
Give me the code.
Lock's intact, ma'am.
You sure the sound was from in here?
Believe me, officer, the walls in this building?
I know what shoes they were wearing.
Sounds pretty quiet.
Of course they're quiet now.

If somebody was in here, they must've slipped out.
This is Officer 249.
We've done a walk-through.

Found them in the bathroom.
It... it was just a feeling you had?
Yeah, like a, uh... a hunch.
Is that a technical term?
These could be trophies he took from the first five victims.
Mm.
I'm sure the families will recognize them.
- Tom...

Can you bring them in here?
I can make that happen.
Take a close look at the ring and the earring.
Tell us if it's possible the items belonged to your sister, Mr. Lachoisto, or your daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Shrain.
We believe we have the man who killed your loved ones.
A verifiable identification of this jewelry can help us put him away.
Thank you.
Would you take a look at these please, Mr. Lachoisto?
Did either of these items belong to your sister?
I've never seen either of these.
Fiona almost never wore jewelry.
According to a witness, your sister was wearing a ring the night that she was killed.
Not this one.
Look at the initials on the band.

Wait.

- Laura...

Um...
Maybe A.H. was her boyfriend.

Please, just... just look at the bag!
- Look at the ba...

I'm sorry.

Of course.
Any luck on the bloody jacket?
All right.
You know I have no choice.
I have to order the release of the detainee.
I'm not giving up.

Thank you.
Laura...

Laura!
What's the code?
Uh, 2215.
It's not opening!
Confess now.

Why do you keep trying to kill me?
Car, gun, pen, fire...
I... y...
Wh...

The code's not working!

If you live...
- ...my daughter dies.

I saw her dead!

Ruby's my favorite student.
Why would I hurt her best friend?
Laura!

You need to take the safety off.
Laura!
Give it...

Okay, okay, okay!

What the hell?
You have got to get ahold of yourself.
If you let him go, he will kill Serena.
You have gone completely out of your mind!
- You don't understand.

You have no i...
No!

No, you can't let him go!
- Laura...

Laura...
If you get arrested, what do I tell Serena?
I will fix this for you.
But you are going to get help.
Mr. Price, your wife assaulted a suspected.
My wife has been under a tremendous amount of stress.
May we keep this a family matter?
- Sir, I...

Or should I ask the chief of police?
Of course.

I have to stay and clean up this mess.
You go home, and I'll talk to you when I get there.
You don't know what you've done.
I love you.
We won't let him out of our sight.
We have to be at the hospital when Mimi comes to.
I don't trust the police.
We'll call Jenny.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Oh, I have a trainload of questions and you, as a person of interest in this screwed-up case, aren't going anywhere until I get answers.
All right.

See, the attorney for the suspect is planning on leveling very serious charges against you...
- Come on.

So you can talk to me, or I can throw you to those dogs.
They can't keep you here.
Yeah, actually they can.
I'll tell my husband...
He'll upgrade me to suspect.
Call Jenny.

Go.

Okay.
- I'll be okay.

- I am so sorry.

Yes, of course.

So sorry.
