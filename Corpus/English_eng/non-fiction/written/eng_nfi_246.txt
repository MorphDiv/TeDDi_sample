You have hidden abilities, it seems.
You're thinking I could tutor you?

Have you fallen so far from this family, emma?
I once knew a doctor.

Did you love him?

She's been sent home.
You must ride hard.
If not, she won't be there when you return.
I shall see you before long.
Please, chaplain, do something.
Help me.

The doctor has been summoned.
Please!
Help me.
The lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliver.

My god is my rock, in whom I take refuge.
Do something!
Shield and the horn of my salvation.
Do something!
Miss.

Well, you'll find her about the wards.
Although, on a day like today, you'll likely to hear her first.
Digi-torum, membran-osus.

No, no.

Why is it that nothing beneath the skin sounds remotely the way it looks?
I tell you, all of human anatomy is its own byzantine recherch.
Sorry, you were saying?
I have cut off more limbs than any other doctor in this war,
And yet, I am forced to pass an exam.
Given to me by a bunch of inkhorn surgeons.
It's an indignity.

Well, you've been at the books day and night, so...
Books!

In one eye and out the other.
My knife is guided by touch and feel,
Not some military manual.
Mcburney has my brain in a pinch.
The major's not to blame.

After he so callously sent miss phinney...
Of course.

You hope to assume her position.
I resent the implication.
Still, you stand to benefit from her misfortunes.
Miss phinney succumbed to an illness not a coup d'etat.
Her position must be filled.
Therefore, my own advancement hangs in the balance,
As does yours.
And yet, I remain fully composed.
Do I not?
Major mcburney has his job to do.
We have ours.
And what if I lose mine,
Byron, do not so easily fall prey to your own anxieties.
It is, how to say, not so alluring.

Miss hastings, the major would like to see you at once...
"at once?" is that his words precisely?
Good "at once" or bad "at once?"
I-I couldn't say, miss.
That woman is wound tighter than a 10-day clock.
Come with me, samuel.
Our transfemoral expired last night.
Seems awful sudden, sir.
Was there a hemorrhage?
Not that I can tell.
Sometimes a feeble disposition is the only culprit.
I'll have him moved to the dead room.
Samuel.

Exam preparation.
Perhaps a change of venue would be worthwhile.
We need a doctor!

All of them are with patients.
Are you a doctor?
Yes, and a very busy one.
My buddy needs your help.
He needs my help, as does he, him, them.
Your friend's turn will come.
If he ain't dead first.
I'm sorry.

Hold these.
No distension.

From the horse, I reckon.
He was trampled?
No.

To get him here from germantown.
Difficult ride at night.
He'd do the same for me.
You left your regiment?
Regiment got overrun.
We was killing face to face,
But every last man got it some way or another,
And I took danny along.
The rest are still bleeding out there.
How old are you, son?
Born june 18th, '44.
I don't much like folk eyeballin' me, and now fix him!
Relax, soldier.

Miss green, find this man a bed.
What about the others?
Those men won't last much longer.
You got to tell somebody.
How many men, soldier?
20, 25.
Up past ayres farmhouse.
Chaplain, it's already been a night.
Buzzards will pick them apart.
Don't leave them out there to die.
Come, come.
Let's find you a bed.
Miss hastings, I rather pride myself.
On my surgical efficiency.

But that is not why I was dispatched to this hospital.

It is my administrative skills that were most needed here.
As such, I find it simply unconscionable.
That one tart should have three peach slices.
And the other 11.
11!
Surely you see the slippery slope.
Today, peaches.
Tomorrow, vital life-saving medical supplies.
How can a hospital properly function.
If it can't even count its...
Peaches?
Let us not answer my question with your questions.
Peaches.

Any prospective head nurse would not tolerate such imprecision.
Sir, in my defense, the tart, as with all matters of nutrition,
Falls to the kitchen staff.
Well, now it falls to you.
Henceforth, I will expect all tart fruits.
To be notated by type and quantity.
I expect two peach tarts of exact and equal composition.
On my desk by 5:00.
The minute hand makes a full circle for every hour,
The hour hand for every day.
Why is it important for us to know how to tell time?
How do we know when it's time to go to work?
When the overseer say it time.
You are your own overseers now.
Soon, you will have paying work,
So you must oversee your own time.
I gathered some books for you.
Samuel here is a free man from up north.
Born free.
Care to speak to the students?
Me?
Tell them about your work here.
Not much to tell.
I help out around the hospital,
Washing the floors, fixing what's broke.
Watching the doctors and learning what they know.
Samuel plans to become a doctor himself one day.
A negro doctor?
They got those?
I won't be the first.
A man named david jones peck already did it.
He graduated from a white college.
And that was 15 years ago.
It came this morning.
From a mrs.

He was married?
From his mother, I suspect.
I haven't opened it.
We had to defend ourselves.
I know, jimmy, I know.
But that dreadful lawman...

Back to washington city with mcclellan.
Let's hope he stays by his master's side.
You needn't worry.
It's just me here.

Someone has to tend the business while father is off on holiday.
Your father is off trying to restore our reputation.
You of all people should understand that.
With some far-fetched plan to align the british empire.
Judah benjamin will laugh in his face.
He is doing what he can, jimmy.
It is called diplomacy.
My business with secretary benjamin will take a few hours.
You go straight to auntie cora's.
And deliver those sweet cakes your mother baked.
We'll meet back at the hotel after supper.
Keep a close eye on her.
Yes, sir, mr.

Driver, take us to the old tavern on manchester.
We meant to go see your kinfolk.
Do as I say, driver.

If we stop en route, belinda,
Father will never know any different, will he?
Driver.
Hyah.
Dr. Foster, do you require...
I am sorry that I was misleading about miss phinney's departure.
Deeply.
I had nothing to do with the decision.
I have said so many times.
Hand me some fresh lint, please.
I see you're a tad clenched.
Something the matter?
Have you any peaches?
Cook says we're out, and I must have peaches by 4:00.
How's he doing?
Laceration has been repaired, superficial at that.
This man should be on his feet,
Yet his pulse continues to weaken.
Respiration increasingly labored.
His condition is puzzling.
I swore to him that he'd be all right.
I know it was stupid to say.
Well, hope can be its own medicine.
If we start eliminating what isn't the cause,
We may arrive at what is,
Look.

Is it noon already?
What is she doing here?
An anatomist, they say.
Apparently, you can add "-ist" to the end of any old thing.
And call yourself an expert.
I plan the piano.
That doesn't make me a pianist, does it?
And that dress.
However did she get past the flagpole.
Without being hoisted up it?
Hello, jed.
Mademoiselle.
Please.

And I prefer "dr.

I see you two have been previously acquainted.
Well, then.
Au revoir.
Funny.
This great big war, so many hospitals,
And you show up at this one.
Imagine my surprise.
Had I known you'd be here,
I would have brought the coat you left on my hook.
Three years ago.
I've moved on to a new coat.
Your married, I understand?
Yes.

That's an interesting choice of words.
Contented?

Quite a chaotic morning, no?
And down a head nurse to boot.
I've met her.
She wanted you to have this.
He's awake!
Aimes?

Do something, doctor!
What ails him?

But the cough is new.
Blood.
This is concerning,
But it might tells us what is wrong with him.
Pipe down, all of you before I take out my belt!
You think the rebs cause all the pain around here?
Well, keep this up, and you'll find out different.
Get away.
Go easy on 'em, matron.
Lads will be lads.
Declan!

What in god's name are you doing here?
Dressed up like that?
You haven't been court-martialed, have you?
Can't a boy come visit his mum?
I can feel your ribs.
Wagons?

Yes.

Why not 10 or 100?
Those men are out there.

Could be the ether talking.
And if not, we leave them out there to die.
Out there's not my problem.

Major, I must implore you...
Your work is at the bedside, chaplain, not on the battlefield.
What will become of us.
If we are each doing a job other than our own?
If the artillery men cooked.
And the cooks fired the artillery,
This war would be lost in a week!
Is that my sole purpose in this war?
To parrot bible verses?

God's word brings the men peace.
Or brings me peace.
Gives me the illusion that I'm actually doing something.
To help these men.
I'll rescue them myself.
Chaplain, you have faith, courage, resolve,
But what means have you to procure those wagons?
I'll speak to the teamsters,
Make an appeal to their conscience.
I'm sure that many...
Some, at least...

Or I can provide the money,
And you'll have as many wagons as you need.
If you allow me to go with you.
Brought a new text.
No doubt it's the best yet on the subject.
Gray's anatomy.

Beautiful illustrations.
Who needs a book when we have the real thing?
Cause of death was indeterminate.
Surely an investigation is justified.
You propose an autopsy?
You've done one before.
In philadelphia, I assisted dr.

So shall you assist me.
And you will point out the gaps in my knowledge.
Unless you'd rather be fixing a leak somewhere.
No, sir.
Very good.
Where shall we begin...

Ooh, heart.
Enter.
Is that a beck brothers microscope?
Been in the box for two weeks.
Like a toy on christmas morning.
This patient's case.
Presents an opportunity to finally unwrap it.
I worked with a similar one in geneva.
I was asked to develop a method for photographing the slides.
You intend to examine the sputum.
I can prepare a suitable diatom to help you calibrate it.
If you wish.
I think we may have gotten off, how do you say,
The wrong leg?
It's hard to say know what would be the right leg with you.
You are still angry about the earl.
I thought he was a count.
We are not children.

In truth, I thought you had changed.
During those brief few months.
Well, I might have had you asked,
But you know don't know how, do you?
To ask for what you want?
So instead you run away to your "arrangement."
If you must know, we're annulling.
By telegraph.

Trust me, you haven't lived.
Until you've quarreled in morse code.
And miss phinney?

Our arrangement was a professional one.
There's that word again.
Is the objective the right one?
Yes.
This does clarify things.
Shall I prepare the specimen?
Thank you, mademoiselle.
But I think I can take it from here.
You'll spoil me rotten!
What point is there in coming to visit your ma.
If you can't get a home-cooked meal?
Especially if might be my last.
What's that?
Army's lining up for a fight west of here, in maryland.
Colonel wants us out front.
Good chance I won't make it to noon.
Unless... never mind.
Unless what?

Unless I were to have a deferment.
Deferment?

From my regiment to another.
Surveyors, quartermaster...
On what grounds?
Epilepsy, asthma, hemorrhoids... anything!
As long as the surgeon signs for it.
Ma, the colonel is mad.
It's senseless.
If I go, I'll die.
And if you don't,
Some other mother's son will go in your place.
But not your son.
I'll see what can be done.
Tell me what you see.

Green factory bread and butter for the last 30 years.
Parts arrived disassembled.
Bed rails,
Brass headboard rods,
Various hardware.
A rifle?
A little prototype I rigged up.
We can buy guns from as far away as europe.
Yankee inspectors will never know.
Green, that's a pretty good ruse.
Guess signing that oath wasn't such a bad idea, after all.
What's your father know of this?
Not a word, and he won't.
He has his way, I have mine.
Whoa!
Sorry, mr.

W-we was just hauling lumber for the factory.

You understand what I'm saying.
Yes, sir, mr.

Leave the lumber.
There's other work to be done outside.
Don't worry.

They're niggers.
One of them boys,
His father's father worked for my family.
You got a decent heart, jimmy.
In times of war,
That's a weakness.
You get rid of them.
Or we will.
Miss green, forgive me for asking,
But why have you done this?
My father's free.
We have you to thank for it.
I appreciate his generosity.
I'd like to tell him personally.
I'm sure he'd like that.
If he knew.
My father has a strong box in his study.
I took the money.
You feel guilty.
I'm not accustomed to keeping secrets.
Have you ever sat for a portrait before?
No, ma'am.
All the money I get, I send home.
My folks have had a hard time on the farm.
Well, try and relax, yes?
Tell me, where is this farm?
Ohio.

A fancy lady like you ain't never heard of it.
In case his family ever sees this.
His mama loves the lord.
You two are very close.
Ought to be.
When I was fresh fish,
Other fellas hassled me on account of my size.
He stood up for you.
And he's funny, too.
Nobody tells a joke like danny.
I'll tell you some that he told me,
But I can never remember 'em right.
And anyhow, it ain't fitting for a lady.
Your friend has a parasite in his sputum.

I don't understand.

It's an infestation.
I've never seen it before, but I'm certain it's what ails him.
Is there a cure?
None on record.

Oil of turpentine, sulfate of magnesia, and a mercurial.
He'd have to drink it.
It may kill him, but at this rate, well...
I'll prepare the compound.
That was a bit cold, no?
Where is the compassionate physician I used to know?
There's something wrong with those boys.
I believe they are deviants.
Deviants?
Jed, it's not a crime.
Sir, I know that you have been trying to court the british.
Into the war on our side,
And I have come with a plan that I believe may make it possible.
You have a plan to bring the british in?
Yes, sir.

Yeah, but before you begin, I must inquire, sir,
As to why you are really here.
To help with our cause, of course.
Do you suspect some other motive?
Well, your son did sign an oath of allegiance to the union?
I assure you, he only did so in order to free me from prison.
You were released by executive order, I believe.
Yes, signed personally by, um, now,
I want to get the name just right.
I have it here.
Yes, here it is.
Abraham lincoln.
Sir.

In the heart of the confederacy.
Offering diplomatic advice to the secretary of state.
Mr. Benjamin... tsk, tsk, tsk.
Enjoy your trip back home, sir.
Mr. Green, these are dangerous times.
Keep your family close.
Drink?
Thank you, but I never do.
Funny, I never don't.
Do you have something for me?
Yeah, I got something for you.
You want to be more specific?
I really should be going.
My father's waiting for me outside.
No, he ain't.
Best be careful what lies you tell, schoolgirl.
Be sure to stick it somewhere safe.
Superficial inguinal...
Iliac fascia lata.
Superficial lata.
And the primary vein?
I know this.
I can see this.
I can clamp this, I can cut this, but I cannot name it!
Perhaps we should try gray's anatomy.
Books have always given me trouble.
Letters get mixed up in my mind.
A sentence goes on long enough, I'm seasick by the end of it.
School must have been difficult.
Yes, happy memories.
Father constantly deriding me for my poor marks.
"You lazy stupid boy!
Why don't you try harder?"
You must have done something right.
I watch you work, sir.
I'm better for it.
High praise, samuel.

But what you see are parlor tricks.
I learned to compensate by memorizing what I saw.
When exams came, father used his influence.
What the hell?
During amputation, did you find an exit wound?
There was none.
The ball is fractured.
If this didn't kill him, perhaps the other half did.
I raise you a fin.
Pair of eights.
10s.

Sorry, boys.
Declan.

What is it, mother?
Well, about your deferment...
I'm sorry, son, but the head nurse.
Will simply not agree to talk to the doctors.
You must allow me to speak to her.
No.

It can do no worse!

Miss hastings has a keen eye for chicanery.
If she requires proof of what ails you.
And forces you to submit to an exam.
And finds you are a shirker,
Do you think you'll not be reported?
Is that what you think of me, mother?
That I'm a coward.
Declan.
You are my only surviving son.
If I thought I were in a position to do more...
I understand.

For trying your best.
Miss hastings, I presume.
Would you tell me where I might find miss emma green?
The rebel nurse?
And I am her rebel mother,
Bringing peach sweet cakes for the wounded,
So far from their own mothers.
She asked permission to accompany the chap...

Peach, you said?
Chaplain?

There you are, soldier.
You've done it, chaplain.
We've done it together, miss green.
Help!
Help me.
Did you hear it?
Help, please!
We've left a man behind.
You're not going out there.
He's wounded.
The confederates own the other side of that field!
They'll shoot you.
Chaplain!
My god.
I can't move, sir.
Come on.
Fire at will!
Stay down, chaplain!
Aah!
Why aren't you helping him?
Fire!
Miss, get down!
Miss green!

Hold your fire!

God.
They stopped shooting.
Of course they did.

They may be your enemy, but they're not barbarians.
He's bleeding terribly.
Remove your tie, apply pressure to the wound.
Be forceful.
What are you doing?
Making a tourniquet.
It worked, miss green.
Come on, soldier.
Aimes.
That you?
I'm here, danny.
Everything hurts.
Am I gonna die?
You got a real good doctor.
He gave you some medicine.
Right now, you need your rest,
So stop jawin' up time you could be sleeping.
Hey.

Well, well, well.
You see what he done?
He just kissed him.
Soldier, return to your bed.
This don't concern you, ma'am.
We got a buggerer in our midst.
Shut your trap or I'll shut it for you.
I got him.
Stop it!
Don't!

That is enough!
I'm expelling you from this hospital, private.
You're making a mistake.

Let go of me!

You can collect your things, or I can call a guard and have them collected for you.
What did I do?

It is exactly as I suspected.
It is nothing like you suspect.
And if you care to be enlightened,
You will meet us in your room.
Found it!
A perfect fit, wouldn't you say?
Yes, sir.
I guess the patient wasn't so feeble, after all.
Indeed not.
The projectile lodged in the adductor magnus,
Posing no threat of death.
But a fragment traversed up through the adductor longus,
Entering the pelvic cavity, fracturing the, um...
The... don't you say it!

The iliac crest!
Puncturing the peritoneum, resulting in death by sepsis!
Doctor, if you take their questions.
And imagine yourself at work, you'll master this exam.
Yes.

In fact, I am going to send this report to the hammond museum.
Samuel, this is a noteworthy cause of death.
Probably more common than we think.
You may yet save many lives.
Yes, we may.
Of course, if someone were to find out about my being helped,
Especially by someone like you...
Don't worry, sir.

Right.
We shall attribute these findings.
To dr.

Assisted by samuel diggs.
No.

You like the sound of that?
Yes, sir.

Very good.
Safer that way.
They see "dr.", no one will suspect a negro.
Private aimes, remove your coat.

A man goes off to war to test his mettle...

And ends up a bit player in a french farce.
Now your shirt.

Remove your shirt or I will have you arrested.
Mademoiselle, this is a military institution.
We have an expectation of common decency and honor.
This man should be locked in the stockade where he...
Is a her.
How did you know this was this?
I am an anatomist.

Yes.
Well, I stand corrected.
I'll be...
Over there.
You can dress now.
Mr. Bullen is away taking care of his poor, sick mother.
Then I hereby proclaim you temporary steward.
So you may assume his responsibilities.
I already got enough of those.
You will disassemble these sweet cakes.
And distribute the peach slices equally.
Into two tarts which you will bake,
Sugar, crisp, and deliver to me no later than 4:30.
Why?

Ha!

My neck!
My apologies.

No, I am not all right.

Miss hastings.
And you are?
Camilla beth aimes.
Posing as a soldier is unlawful.
If you were to be found out...
So report me, then.
That is not what dr.

He simply wants to know...

I wanted to do my part.
Same as you.
Your family, do they know?
They I know I send 'em money.
They don't much care where it comes from.
I always pulled my weight in the fields.
I could shoot straighter than any of my brothers.
My folks... they never saw much use for me.
Except to marry me off.
That ain't a family.
When this war come along,
I saw my chance to get away and do some good.
So I took it.
And danny, he showed me how to be and how to fight,
And they don't judge you on more than that.
I would give my life for him.
And him for me.
I got a real family now, thanks to danny.
Does he know?
You fooled everyone, even him?
And you are in love with him.
You must tell him.
Lisette, that man is very sick...
I wouldn't want to distress him none.
He might not make it through the night.
All the more reason.
You have to show him who you really are.
If you don't, you'll regret it as long as you live.
Secretary benjamin, please allow me to tell you this plan.
Dear.

From here to the door, you may make your case.
Next week, a british envoy will be quartered in my home.
A guest of the union.
Now, I seek permission to lobby him on our behalf.
Mr. Green, I have already tried.
To appeal to the british conscience.
Well, then, we must appeal to their purse strings.
The price of raw cotton.
Has increased several hundred percent since the blockade.
Liverpool, manchester...

Workers are being sent home by the thousands.
Common knowledge.
I have gathered a collective of cotton growers.
Who have agreed to sell their considerable surplus.
At a cut rate and guarantee that rate a decade hence.
If england comes in on our side!
Cotton diplomacy?
Indeed.
It may not win this war,
But british intervention will at least get us to a stalemate,
One in which you can negotiate a peace from a point of leverage.
Before we run it by president davis,
You must certify your sincerity.
I will lay my hand on a bible.
New testament or old.
I know you were of the israelite faith.
I'm many things, sir,
But a man is defined by the one thing.
That he's willing to kill or to die for.
In that regard, I am a southerner first.
I fight for my home.
Each man must make his own sense of this war.
On that, we do agree.
So now...
What are you, mr.

Above all else?
Above all?
I am a father.
Who simply wants his children to grow up in peace.
I hate to think of my parents worrying.
We'll go again at first light.
They'll understand.
You don't know my parents.
If they saw what I saw,
I'm quite sure they would be proud.
Emma.
Aah!
Aah!
Dear.

How'd you sleep?
I feel completely...
Un-clenched.
Just think how you'd feel the third time around.
Lieutenant, I must report to the ward.
The wounded will wonder.
Perhaps on your next visit.
Perhaps.
Though, if I make it here again, I'll likely be a patient.
What do you mean?
Well, you heard.
Rebs are moving into maryland.
I'm apt to be killed in the first wave.
Unless you reconsider that deferment.
What deferment?
The matron never asked?
Lieutenant, was this merely a ploy.
To obtain a medical deferment?
A ploy to move me closer to alexandria.
And the insatiable...
Soon-to-be permanent head nurse of a certain hospital.
Where would you rather have me...
Alive in your bed or dead in a coffin?
Intriguing quandary.
Perhaps I could use a little more persuasion.
Morning, mr.

Need you boys for some work.
Yes, sir.
Don't mind me askin'.
How long you suppose it gon' take?
Your father said I could be off early today.
It's my boy's birthday.
Shouldn't take but a few hours.
Get yourselves some shovels.
Yes, sir.
But cousin henrietta called off the engagement.
Not a week before.
Auntie cora was beside herself.
Isn't that right, belinda?

Must have been in the kitchen.
Did you sup together?
We missed the meal, alas.
We was late arriving.
Sir.

We have family in richmond.

Yes, it's all in order.
Well, you gentlemen have a nice but I hope uneventful morning.
Just as soon as we have a look in the young lady's handbag.
My bag?

If you have nothing to hide, miss, then what's it matter?
Alice, give the man your bag.
It's all right, father.
Soldier, how do I put this?
Do you have a daughter?
No, miss.
Well, if you did, you would know that at a certain age,
A girl becomes a prisoner to her biology on a monthly basis.
My handbag contains personal effects of a hygienic nature.
It would be humiliating to reveal them to any man.
Of course, miss.

Let them through.
Where was I?

He makes the most obscene sounds when he eats.
Like a dog.
You'll, talk to the surgeon?
Dr. Hale will be very sorry.
To hear about your dreadful injury.
With proper therapy, administered by the right nurse,
There may be hope for a full recovery.
Declan.
I've been looking all over for you.
I thought you'd gone.
Without saying goodbye?
I...
I found a quiet place to myself last night.
A short rest turned into.
The soundest sleep I've had in months.
Well, I didn't sleep at all.
I have a confession.
I didn't speak to the head nurse.
I couldn't...
It's not right.
I must be a terrible mother.
I, too, must confess.
I came to you in a moment of weakness.
But seeing you.
Has helped me to overcome my fears.
Do you know how proud I am that you're facing up to your duty?
I'll be praying for you.
I do every day.
Worry not, mother.
I am certain I shall return to you soon enough.
He's a fine boy.
You have no idea.
Forevermore, I will associate you with the perfect tart.
Sir?

I found them to be in exacting equilibrium.
And the peach bits.
Were the most sumptuous mix of sweet and savory.
Yes, well, I instructed the head cook to spare no effort...
I should like to see the head cook.
And obtain the recipe myself.
The recipe?

Another sleepless night.
I'm off to the hospital to see about emma.
If anyone asks, please do not tell...
My dear.
Where are you off to?
To tea.

How was your voyage?
A complete success.
They approved of your idea?
By they, you mean judah and jeff.
The president?

Is emma still asleep?
She went to the hospital early.
We discussed appropriate hours.
I was very clear about this.
I am to blame.
She asked, and I gave her permission.
Well, at least one of our girls.
Hasn't lost her sense of respect.
Father and I had a marvelous trip.
The cousins send their love and randolph devoured your cakes.
Lucy has prepared a meal for you.
Promise I'll be back soon.
Such a long journey.

May I be excused?

But leave your handbag with me.
My handbag?

What is this?
I don't know.
You expect me to believe...
A list.

Intended for whom?

Peterson.

These people are our neighbors!
I am sworn to secrecy.
Do you know why their names are here?

I'm forbidden to read it.

These people are seen as collaborators.
They are marked for retribution!

Silly girl.

Your own brother is on this list!
Just a little further, boys.
Mr. Green.
Please, sir.

Aah!
Head north and don't come back.
But mr.

When you get settled, you send for your families.
You cannot stay.
They'll kill you.
Come on.

I know you ain't a nurse.

I ain't no nurse, danny.
Forgive me, miss, do I know you?
It's me, dummy.

Aimes?
This some kind of prank?
I wanted you to see me for who I am.
And to say...
Well, I'm mighty grateful for what a good friend you've been.
I got you this.
I have tried to be a good friend to you,
Watch over you,
Protect you.
Like a brother.
And all along...
You've been lying to me.
You've been looking me in the face like you're doing right now.
And lying.
You ain't no friend of mine.
Danny...
Leave me be.
Get out!
Get out!
Don't you understand?
She is merely a child who needs to be protected,
Not thrown into harm's way!
I demand that you dispatch men to retrieve her.
Or what?

Pardon me, major.

They're calling for all hands.
We need stretchers, bandages, and all available personnel.
Someone get this man inside!
Where did they come from?
Germantown.
Easy.

Let's hope you can keep them alive.
Henry.

If I've done something...

We're both needed presently.
All right.

Thank you, chaplain.
I'm mighty grateful to you for bringing the boys back.
They have you to thank for that, soldier.
You're leaving?

Another fight's coming soon.

Your friend?

Move this one upstairs.
He'll need immediate attention.
