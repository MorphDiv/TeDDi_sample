(grunts)
Special K?
I got myself into this thing, but I don't even need it.
(grunts)
It looks that way.
My face is the last thing you're ever gonna see.
Carl, I'm in the only safe place left here now.
(beep)
I need you to get everything you can off it.
See if you can locate Ferris's phone.
The man holding Kensi is a CIA officer.
Ferris is his real name.
We thought you were Taliban.
I am sorry that I shot you in the leg.
I am going to pay you back...
(saw buzzing)
(laughing quietly)
Stop smiling.
This really is personal to you, isn't it?
I mean, look.
Payback for what I did to your leg, I get that, trust me.
I figured if I could hurt you in more ways than one, why not?
Or maybe spending all those months in Afghanistan with nothing but a horse between your legs kind of got old?
Sweetheart, you were a job.
Maybe.
Or maybe I made you feel like losing your leg didn't matter.
I was just playing a role.
Interesting, 'cause you're about to cut off my leg off, and I'm not even buying it.
You cracked Sharov's cell phone?
No contacts entered, and he only dialed four numbers.
Okay, we use what we've got.
All right, so... first number triangulates to...
The garage where Hetty tried to blow up
Sharov, Sabatino and Carl Brown.
That makes sense.
Second number traces to...
Third number pings a phone at...
Did Callen say anyone else was at the garage?
Carl Brown.
Maybe they brought him a phone.
Or maybe Ferris brought Kensi to the garage, and she got caught up in the explosion.
Oh, my God.
Eric, what if...
No, that's not how this ends.
Yeah.
Fourth number Sharov called.
Yeah.
Kensi could be there.
Callen, Sam, Deeks, we're sending you Ferris's number and what we think are Kensi's coordinates.
(phone ringing, saw stops buzzing)
(phone continues ringing)
I'm sorry, Kensi can't come to the phone right now, but can I please take a message?
That's a wee bit vague, but I'll be sure to let her know.
You give her up without hurting her or you're gonna wind up like the rest of your crew.
Anything else, Agent Callen?
No.
You tell Kensi we're coming for her.
And you have yourself a most pleasant day.
Hopefully that bought us some time, forced him to change his plans.
Let's hope.
Yep.
You know the drill, Special K.
There you go.
Nighty-night.

Yeah, alone.
You don't know what's on the other side of that door.

Yeah, but I haven't lost my hearing.

Kens.
(panting) Guys, I got her.
It's all right, Kens, we got you.
Clear!
(muffled shout)
I got you, Kens.
Get it off her.
(panting)
Joelle?
Where's Kensi?
This is gonna hurt.
(gasping)
I-I can't believe you're here.
How did you even know?
It-it's a long story.
I-I can't even believe you're caught up in this.
I'm so sorry.
Ferris must have left his cell phone.
Can you tell us anything, like how you got here?
Some jerk sideswiped my car this morning, and when I got out to check the damage, he grabbed me and tossed me into a van.
What'd he look like?
Deeks, take it easy.
Yeah.
Must have given something to me so I blacked out.
I-I came to under the hood.
I'm sorry, I don't know where he went.
Son of a bitch!
Deeks!
We're gonna find her!
Oh, God.
Where is Miss Blye?
Like I said before, Ferris never told me.
Those two had history.
Where is Officer Ferris?
Hetty, I know this looks bad.
Damn straight.
Sharov and Ferris never told me their endgame.
Fact is, I was trying to bring these guys down.
And before I realized what I was into and who we were going after, it was too late.
That's the honest truth.
What you need to know, Hetty, is I'm on your side.
I'm telling you the truth.
I wasn't pulling the strings, and I don't know where she is.
I want to help you.
I want these guys as badly as you do.
Your utter lack of creativity is such a disappointment to me.
Where is she?
Deeks, I swear, he didn't tell me.
(groans)
Let me rephrase the question.
(groans)
Where... is... she?
Pound me like a piece of meat,
I still couldn't tell you, 'cause I don't know.
Hey, enough.
(coughs)
Your team needs to get ahold of their emotions.
Deeks especially.
Mr. Deeks is showing more grace than I would have expected.
Well, this isn't personal.
The hell it's not.
You and your ghouls have tried to pick off everyone on my team.
I was weeding out the bad apples.
Trying to do the right thing.
Then where is Miss Blye?
Like I told you before, Hetty,
I have no idea.
She's not buying it, Sabatino.
We can see the lies stuck between your yellow teeth.
Hell no.
Come on, I'm cool, I promise you.
You're talking to the monitor about his dental hygiene.
Not a chance.
Sit over here.
I got someone bringing you some Nutella.
You remembered.
I promise you you're safe here.
Thank you, Callen.
You-you're being really kind.
You never should have been brought into this.
I was expecting to see Kensi, and when it was you, I just, I just lost it.
Well, kind of.
Excuse me.
So what'd I miss?
Not much.
Sabatino says he doesn't know where Ferris has Kensi, and he's been working against these people.
Which is a big fat post-truth.
Deeks tried to break his face.
Going off book for this one, huh?
There is no book for this one.
Do we trust him?
Negative.
So do we release him, see if he leads us back to Ferris?
Sabatino for Kensi.
That's only if we find Ferris or he reaches out.
Nell's headed to the church right now.
If Ferris left any evidence, she will find it.
We just better hope he left this phone behind for a reason.
Ugh.
Oh, just me, quivering from creepiness.
Paint me a picture.
A very detailed picture.
Fluorescent lights, sad '70s carpet, sad toys that are... strangely decapitated.
Hmm.
Let's think about this.
Let's say that Ferris was in here with Kensi when Callen called.
Okay.
Ferris is committed, he doesn't want to surrender, so the call forces him to adjust his plans and flee.
And then he leaves his phone behind so we think he's still at the church.
But when Callen, Sam and Deeks do show up,
Ferris is gone, Kensi's gone.
Joelle's in her place.
Which means Joelle must have already been here.
But she said she didn't see Kensi.
Huh.
Well, maybe that's because she was wearing a black hood over her head.
All right.
So why leave Joelle behind?
Uh, assuming he was alone, he couldn't move them both, and he knew we were coming for Kensi.
Unless...
What if Kensi was never here?
What if... (chuckles softly)
What if we have no idea where she's been or what she's been through since Ferris took her this morning?
(door opens)
Oh...
Mr. Callen.
Tell me something good.
Granger is in stable condition.
He has around-the-clock protection.
I wasn't talking about Owen.
Nell is still looking.
I see.
Use your instincts with this guy.
He's a parasite.
(door closes)
You're freezing me out.
That's cute.
Real cute, Callen.
I don't know what else you want me to tell you that I didn't already say to Rumpelstiltskin.
I just have one question for you.
How did you think this was gonna end?
Well, certainly not in cuffs sitting across from you.
That you were gonna be a hero?
Wouldn't argue if they were offering.
For exposing some corrupt government agency?
Is that right?
But it was my agency I was trying to disrupt, the CIA.
Wake up, Callen.
I'm your only shot at finding Kensi.
How's that?
The only reason you're here talking to me is because Ferris hasn't been in touch, correct?
Yeah.
He's gone underground.
And if Kensi's still alive-- which is a big, big "if," I might add-- he took her with him.
And I'm the only one who can get him to come out again.
(sighs)
No.
What do you mean, no?
Um... no, thank you.
We'll find her another way.
That's a mistake.
You don't know Ferris the way I do.
The guy's sick.
There's a reason he joined the CIA, and let me tell you, it is not for love of country.
Tell me about Ferris.
We spent two months together in Afghanistan, and let me tell you...
Deeks, don't go there.
Hetty didn't have a choice.
Hetty didn't protect her either.
She wasn't ready.
She wasn't herself, and we knew that, and then this happens.
Kensi is as tough as nails.
You'll see.
She's gonna make the bastard pay.
(humming quietly)
Oh...
Hey.
Wakey, wakey.
Special K!
We're home.
So when did you find out our team was the target?
Well, later than I'm proud to admit.
Before or after you infected our server with spyware?
They used me.
Before or after you sent Tahir Khaled to my son's school?
Sam, I didn't have anything to do with that.
I was working this for two years.
If Hetty hadn't sent Kensi to Afghanistan, none of this would've happened.
But every time you guys interfered over there, you cost them money.
And eventually, I guess, they decided to try to get rid of you in order to protect their operations.
You couldn't have warned us?
I didn't know who they were going after until I saw Hetty with Carl Brown.
Swear to God.
They didn't tell me everything.
They didn't trust me.
Does anyone?
You know why I don't trust you, Sabatino?
'Cause you're giving my wife a bad name.
How so?
Michelle was with you in the CIA.
She's the reason you came to my house for dinner.
She's the reason you met my kids.
She vouched for you.
Well, then maybe you should be asking her about these guys.
Hey, you're already walking on thin ice.
Don't make me smash your head through it.
Sam, I would never do anything to hurt your kids.
Or your wife.
Or anyone on your team.
Yes.
And you guys have to let me.
(yells)
Oh!
You feel better?
I can't do this.
He may not have anything to give us.
You might not have a choice, Mr. Deeks.
That is awful rich, Hetty, considering you're the person that put her in this position in the first place.
Uh, maybe I should go...
It's not enough you get your whole team locked up, now you go and kill every single person who might know where she's being held?
It's okay.
I'm gonna be perfectly clear about this.
If Sabatino doesn't know where she is, that means she's in this all by herself.
You understand what that means, right?
If anything happens to her... that's on you.
Now, do you feel any better?
(camera clicks)
Hey, Eric?
I think I found something.
It's a black case of some sort.
I don't know.
You don't need to know, and you don't want to know.
Yep.
And that is not a good thing.
Wait a second.
Okay, Eric.
I think I know how Ferris got Kensi in and out of the church.
Now we think that Kensi was inside the church?
Actually, I don't know what I think.
But I found what appear to be wheelchair tire marks on the sidewalk outside the church, as well as in the room where Callen found Joelle.
Beard.
Um, no beard.
(pants)
I'm just just gonna grab everything and bring it back to Ops.
Turn around, put your hands on your head, get on your knees and cross your ankles.
That's not gonna happen.
How'd you get in here?
You must be Eric.
Uh...
This is Hetty's I.D. How'd you get this?
She gave it to me.
This place is on lockdown.
Are you mocking me?
Then take the compliment.
Okay, thank you.
Who are you?
A.J. Chegwidden.
We'll see about that.
(beeping)
Two D's.
Admiral.
Retired.
You gave me quite a scare.
That's some grip.
I just have a toned pollicis brevis.
Occupational hazard?
No one ever gets that joke...
Do you game?
Oh, look at me, son.
Damn right.
Shut up!
Not literally, sir.
(clears throat) This is so cool.
So cool.
So what are you doing here?
From what I surmise, you're up to your asses in alligators, and I'm here to fix that.
And, Eric, that is your cue to get me up to speed.
Chop, chop.
Aye aye, sir.
Follow me.
Where's Joelle?
You two act like you ate her.
No word from Ferris?
Nothing.
Michelle trusts him?
Yes, she does.
But she's been away from the agency too long.
She doesn't know Ferris or the others.
Then we're gonna trust him, too.
Really?
Sabatino can take us to a CIA safe house that Ferris may have taken Kensi to.
Sabatino's probably walking us into an ambush.
Sabatino leads us to Kensi.
Lock and load.
If this goes south, what about Granger?
I've taken extra precautions to keep him safe.
Gentlemen, give 'em hell.
(door opens)
- Hi.- Hey.
He still sleeping?
About all he's been doing.
I'll be quiet.
I just want to hold his hand for a bit.
Take your time.
They say he can hear you if you talk to him.
Thank you.
Welcome.
(heart monitor beeping steadily)
(beeping stops)
(grunting)
And this is our trusty touch screen monitor.
Which, honestly, we don't use nearly enough.
Ooh, this is Nell.
Oh, but of course, of course you know who Nell is.
(chuckles) You saw my wallpaper.
Admiral Albert Jethro Chegwidden.
You two know each other?
Only by reputation.
Former Navy SEAL, commander of JAG, close friend of Hetty Lange.
I thought you had retired, sir.
So did I, but Henrietta called, said she was in trouble, so here I am, once more in the breach.
Well, we are happy to have you, sir.
What is it?
Granger.
There's been a shooting at the hospital.
I thought he had 24-hour protection.
He did.
You people are a mess.
Welcome to NCIS Los Angeles.
We be crazy.
(sighs)
Eric,
I want a full security detail sent to the hospital and the boatshed.
I want security footage of the shooting.
I want a detailed work-up of the woman Granger killed now.
Where's Henrietta?
We don't know.
Screw it, send the detail to the hospital.
I'm going to the boatshed myself.
Were you ever here before?
You know that guy?
Nope.
Yeah, he's probably a lookout.
Well, Sabatino, you're either trying to get us all killed...
Or you were set up.
G and I will take the front.
(man grunts)
On your knees!
Hands on your head!
Down, on your knees!
Kensi!
Anything?
I got nothing.
It's not over, Deeks.
Honey, no lemon.
Oh, thank you.
Y-You all have been so kind to me.
Oh, we're not... always so kind.
Really, I-I'm feeling so much better.
That surprises me, considering the circumstances.
You've lost three of your colleagues already today.
You have a tell...
Officer Taylor.
How long have you known?
Not long enough.
Criminal activity is one thing, but your betrayal of Callen will not go unpunished.
I never meant to hurt anyone.
I was only supposed to keep an eye on Callen, to gather intelligence.
But the op changed.
Hetty, I got dragged into this as much as anyone.
And by then, I was at a point in my relationship with Callen where I just couldn't deceive him anymore.
How romantic.
That's my cue.
Stay.
You haven't even finished your tea.
Look, whatever's going on between NCIS and the CIA is-is way above my pay grade.
I keep tabs on the foreign dignitaries who send their kids to my school.
That's my sweet spot.
I'm not cut out for the wet work.
But in a pinch, you'd use it.
(chuckles)
I'll take good care of Callen.
You have my word.
It's my understanding that you're already in his rearview mirror.
(grunts)
Henrietta.
Who's the redhead?
Callen's ex-girlfriend.
You really are in trouble.
Come on, Special K.
You can't sleep the day away.
Hey.
We've got work to do.
(coughing)
(laughs) Nice try.
(coughing, gasping)
Hey, hey, Kensi.
Hey, hey, Kensi.
(coughing continues)
No, no, no, you are not getting off that easily.
(grunts)
(grunts)
(groans)
(fabric rips)
(grunting)
(groans)
(groans loudly)
(panting)
Is she dead?
Well, I didn't hit her that hard.
Go either way.
A.J., I had questions I needed to ask her.
What, did you want me to let her shoot you first?
She'll be fine.
Just gonna have a hell of a hangover, a nasty concussion, but she'll survive.
(gasps)
(groaning softly)
How you doing?
My head.
What happened?
Who are you?
Details.
Where is Miss Blye?
I don't know.
Where is Officer Ferris?
Joelle.
What the hell happened?
I wouldn't do that.
Or that.
And you are?
A.J. Chegwidden.
Mr. Callen, step away from
CIA Officer Taylor.
Oh, snap.
Officer Taylor?
I'm sorry.
And I'm the bad guy.
Jones.
Assistant Director.
Field work suits you.
Yeah.
I thought you were supposed to be resting.
Well, I'm trying, so let's make it quick.
You got it.
All right.
I'll be right back.
Tim, Nancy, would you form a wall?
Thank you.
All right.
(phone beeps)
Nope.
(phone chimes)
Ring finger?
Who picks the ring finger?
It's not like you think.
You lied to me.
You lied to me.
It's not the same.
Isn't it?
Joelle, I was trying to protect you.
So was I.
I really cared for you.
Just stop it.
Look, that's why I broke it off.
I'm sorry.
I truly am.
I forgive you.
But not the betrayal.
If you can't forgive me, how will you ever forgive yourself for all the times you've done this to other people?
You want to talk?
No.
You know, you guys introduced me to her.
I was waiting for that.
We were all fooled, G.
We were human.
You're on speaker, Eric.
Doesn't really help us because his phone is in the boatshed with you.
So what else did you find?
A text chain between Ferris and two other contacts in the phone.
So?
So, those two phones are at the same residential address in Studio City.
I'm sending it to you now.
That could be where they're keeping Kensi.
I say we give them some hope.
You just don't quit.
I am going to end you!
And I support big dreams, I do, but you realize it's just not realistic at this point.
(phone vibrates)
Hot dog.
That's the good news I needed.
Now, before you see this,
I want you to know it's okay to have big feelings.
He's gone.
Stone cold.
(phone vibrates)
Oh, but this one's gonna hurt.
Deeks, you go in the front door with Sam.
I'll go around the side.
All right, where do you want me?
What the hell?
I think you've helped enough.
We've got company.
Go.
We just can't seem to find any us time anymore.
♪ ♪
Ready here.
Ready.
One... two...
(automatic gunfire)
Go!
(woman grunts)
(saw buzzing)
One more s...
Double tap to the head.
You must really love me.
Ah, my baby's bleeding.
Kens, you okay?
Dad, get out of the room.
Kensi, you all right?
He said get out of the room.
(sighs, chuckles)
Ooh, you scared me.
Sabatino's gone.
Guess he wanted to stay in play.
Thought we were looking for one mole, turns out there's several.
Did we get them all?
I sure as hell hope so.
Well, this is very embarrassing.
I really don't feel comfortable with this right now.
If somebody could please take a picture of this?
What?
I appreciate your coming on such short notice, A.J.
Well, I could use the warm weather.
Besides, D.C. is starting to make California look sane these days.
What's the word on Granger?
Well, better people have tried to kill him.
You, yourself included, as I recall.
(chuckles)
Heard the rumors about agent orange.
Be a hell of a deal, that's what gets us.
None of us are going to get out of here alive.
Ah, Henrietta, always a ray of sunshine.
Maybe you could stick around for awhile, A.J.
Our mole may be dead, but we still have quite a mess to clean up.
I could use the help, and maybe even a good lawyer.
I'll think about it.
(saw buzzing)
(heart monitor beeping steadily)
Am I dead?
You're not that lucky.
What about the others?
Safe and sound.
And the mole?
I'll tell you all about it in due time.
But right now, you-you just need to rest.
(clears throat)
Can you go back to sleep?
You know, I dreamt there was a buzzard and he kept circling me.
