What have you got against Michael Farmer except him being retarded enough for you to frame?

Is this you, Michael?
I'm not sure
DC Desford, for what reason have you been accessing highly sensitive
AC-12 files, namely DI Matthew Cottan's Dying Declaration?
This wasn't me, sir.
But I don't want to be somewhere I'm not wanted, so I'll take a transfer
And obviously the person with the opportunity and means to frame both
Michael Farmer and Timothy Ifield is DCI Roz Huntley.
Your files should be handed over to a new, more impartial authority.
What are friends for?
Let me give you a different phone number.
There's a network of corrupt police officers doing the bidding of organised crime.
"H?" His name begins with H.
"H."
Superintendent Hastings, you will be served with a Regulation 15 notice.
The wound was very deep.

- No!

We've learnt Mr Huntley shares a solicitor with Michael Farmer.
I represented Michael.
What went on between myself and my client is privileged.
I've got tangible concerns that she's involved in a serious crime.
You were at the crime scene the night Tim Ifield was murdered.
Nicholas Huntley, I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Timothy Ifield.
You're hurting me.
That was incredibly brave and honest of you, ma'am.
It was Roz, she's lying about everything.

The hotel wasn't able to provide an adjoining room... on such short notice...
.. but the other one's just down the hall.
I know it's difficult.
It's just while the officers are at the house.
Is Dad going to come here too?
These things take time.
Why aren't you doing anything, why aren't you helping him?
It's complicated.
I want the other room.
You think Nick Huntley would've risked leaving evidence here, his missus a copper?
'Message for DS Twyler.

Received.
- DS Twyler?

What can I do for you?
Nick Huntley's solicitor's kicking up a stink.
He's accusing Polk Avenue officers of favouring their own DCI's story over his.
Your Chief Super's worried the defence could use it in court.
You're taking over?
Sorry.
Kate.
Polk Avenue is starting the first round of interviews.
There's no news yet.
Dammit!

We had that case in the palm of our hands, and she's thrown everybody off the scent!

Murder Squad, plus AC-9 observing -

AC-9 -

The whole thing's kicking off!

Kate.
Who from Murder Squad?
Mr Huntley, I'm Detective Sergeant Railston, this is my boss,
Detective Chief Superintendent Hargreaves.
We're Murder Squad out of Fourth Street Station.
None of us have any previous work connection with DCI Huntley.
However, detectives from AC-9 will be observing 'in connection with ongoing anti-corruption inquiries.'
'Noted.'
'What you were doing at Tim Ifield's flat?

My wife, Roz...
DCI Huntley, she...
I was following her.
All right.

I suspected that she was seeing someone else, an affair.
Was she?
I believe so, that's what she told me, with another police officer, a married man.
Mrs Huntley denies an affair, and our inquiries find there was no other officer present that night.
So you thought Tim Ifield was having sex with your wife?
No.

How would you describe your emotional state that evening,
Mr Huntley?
Were you in a frame of mind to control your wife's behaviour,
Mr Huntley, to coerce her?
No, no, no...

She went inside!
There are no witnesses to your wife entering Timothy Ifield's flat.
No CCTV.

Well, she'd left her mobile phone at home.
So did you, pal.
I was in a rush.

So this fella, this Timothy Ifield, who you may or may not have thought was having sex with your wife,
- what did you plan to do to the pair of them?

Nothing.

How would I?
- We look at three things.

- You were there.

Tim's not a big fella, not a fighter,
- there were knives in the flat.

You believed he was having an affair with your wife.
No.

"So it wasn't me, it was the one-armed woman." Eh?
'Is that it?

My gaffer wants the 18-search of Huntley's home completed by first thing in the morning.
Hi.
Hi.
How's it going?
All right.
- I heard about your accident.

So what's Nick Huntley been saying?
She's not at liberty to disclose.
And this was our case.
Not according to Assistant Chief Constable Hilton.
He assigned you?
Hastings didn't appreciate my ability.

I'm sorry.
You know what, you dumped Steve at the first sign of trouble.
I think it's a bit late for apologies.
Night.
Wait.
This has to be totally off the record.
Yeah.

'And then I saw her' stop off at a minicab office.
So she took a minicab 'part of the way and then she carried on on foot.'
- To Tim's flat?

- She went inside?

Roz got out of the cab to avoid the traffic cameras.
She was inside Tim's flat while Nick was waiting outside in his car, like Marion and Geoff.
And then he sees something.
Uh... around... seven... 'a man came out of the flat.

All right, what was in these bags?
I don't know.
All I remember is there was a big tube sticking out of one of them, like a...
Like a roll of something.
That fits with the security cameras at the DIY store that evening.
A large roll of plastic sheeting.
Can you describe this man?
Medium height, medium build.

Tim Ifield.
And then there's this.
When did you leave Tim's flat?
Uh... about 11.
A woman came out of the flat, and she was looking at my car.
She'd arrived a few minutes earlier, in a nurse's uniform.
Tim's downstairs neighbour, who told us she mistook Nick's car for a minicab.
'I thought she might' get suspicious, so I left.

Your wife says different.
'She was at home, off sick from work.'
You didn't come rolling in till nine the following morning.
No!

She was the one that was out all night!
It's hard to know who to believe, Nick or Roz.
A traffic camera spotted Nick's car leaving the area at just after 11, exactly as he's stated in his interview.
Maybe he's telling the truth -- he went home.
Roz hired a minicab to avoid the traffic cameras.
According to Nick, she was still in the flat when he left.
Unfortunately no-one saw her leave.
But we know she was on foot.
That's a hell of a distance to walk all the way home.
Her car was at the minicab firm, that's much nearer.
I'll check it out.
Roz Huntley pitched up at the minicab firm as a walk-in.
No name given, no contact information and the place doesn't have security cameras.
Yeah, well, she knew the one to pick, all right.
One of the drivers recalled a woman as being dark-skinned, but that was all, and no-one saw her return the next day for her car.
Sorry, sir.
That's it.

No, it hasn't.
Tim Ifield died of severe blood loss.
There's no way anyone managed to kill him and clear up the whole crime scene without getting bloodstains on their clothing.
A search of the crime scene uncovered spare hangers in Tim's wardrobe that bore grey synthetic fibres probably from a tracksuit.
This item of clothing has never been found.
The killer took the tracksuit.
It'd be a perfect choice.
It's loose-fitting and it's also unisex.
I mean, it could've been worn by Roz just as easily by Nick.
Yeah, well, that's all very good, but it doesn't really tell us what either of them were doing next.
Actually, it does, sir.
Tim's murderer couldn't risk being seen in a new outfit.
By wearing it, the tracksuit could've become contaminated with his or her DNA, so he or she had to dispose of it.
Their next move had to be to return home to pick up another change of clothes.
Roz Huntley knows inside out all the mistakes offenders make in the hours following a crime.
And, as SIO, she was aware that nobody even knew Tim was dead yet.
And she knows when his body's found, those 24 hours around the time of death are going to be the main focus of the efforts to pick up the evidence trail.
If they'd have had the guts, they'd have sat tight on that evidence before finally disposing of it as far away as possible from their known haunts.
Right.

- Tim Ifield's murder.

We're to conduct a citywide security camera survey for the period beginning the 19th of March.
The suspects are Nicholas Huntley and DCI Roseanne Huntley.
ANPR survey targets their registered vehicles.
If either of them made a false move, we need to find it.

On the medical side, we'll make sure you get the best treatment, no matter what.
Thank you very much, sir.
Now, I wish they could be, particularly in the circumstances, but certain things can't be ignored.
My husband.
I understand, sir.
Hence I've recused myself from leading the inquiry.
I wish it were enough.
There are unresolved allegations against you.
I'm sure I can persuade everyone to conclude proceedings quietly... .. if you intend to resign.
It's the only way you take back control, and it's the only way to avoid further challenges to the charging of Michael Farmer.
I've given everything to this job.

No.
I'm not bent, sir.
I'm a diligent, dedicated officer, a loyal officer.
- Of course you are.

But AC-12's findings extend further, to your husband's solicitor and you.
Jimmy Lakewell and me?

They claim between you you had prior knowledge of Michael Farmer's criminal record.
It's going to be such an uphill struggle to fight.
Resign and it'll all be behind you.
'She blames me for' the operation on her arm.
'The doctors tried to save it, but it was already dead.
'The infection had spread into her bloodstream.'
But she was the one that was trying to hide all of this.
'She was the one that was avoiding seeing our GP.'
Why was she trying to hide it?
She said that she'd grazed her hand on some brickwork.
'Now, I was doubting that, and so was the doctor, because...'
Because they found that it was infected with MRSA, 'which must have come from another person.'
What is it, sir?
Well, the hospital was forced to disclose the details of
Roz Huntley's medical condition and, er...
Apparently it started with a cut on her arm that then became infected.
But look at the date.
Nick Huntley says he first noticed his wife was wearing a plaster on her arm...
.. the day after Tim Ifield's murder.
It's not possible to examine the patient's amputated hand.
It was incinerated.

But the samples that the surgeons took, the infection swabs and tissue biopsies and stuff, they'd still have those.
How specific can you get about the infection?
Well, erm...

The laboratory can do whole genome sequencing of the bacteria.
I think it's about as specific as DNA profiling the person.
From the victim's body, could the bacteria be matched to the bacteria that came from him?
- How old's the body?

I'm no expert, but I imagine by now he'll be like a garden overrun with weeds.

I'll just get your medication.
Sorry.
Can you just explain how MRSA from one person can get into the wound of another person?
MRSA is a commensal organism -- it lives naturally and harmlessly on the carrier, usually inside the nose.
You can imagine how easily the bacteria can transfer to the carrier's own hands and then infect a wound or...
- Sorry.

OK.

- Yeah.

Weren't there fibres removed at postmortem from Tim Ifield's nose?
They were believed to be from a balaclava
- he wore shortly before his death.

Right, well, the fibres were sampled just a few days after his death.
There is a chance it's still infected with the MRSA bacteria 'if Tim was a carrier.'
Right, OK, leave that with me, I'll get on to the labs.
I'll make it a matter of priority.
Thanks so much for this, Jodie.
I'm happy to help, ma'am.
- You said you found something?

I, erm...
I ran a database check, to see why AC-12 might question a link between you and Mr Lakewell.
Nothing turned up regarding a professional connection, as you've said, you only know him socially, through your husband.
So I ran Mr Lakewell's name as a cross-check with other case keywords.
Lakewell was Michael Farmer's solicitor when Farmer was convicted of rape as a 16-year-old.
What?

I'm not sure, Jodie.
I need you to do one more thing for me.
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I need you to carry out some telecoms inquiries.
Will you do that for me, please?
Yeah.
How are you getting on, son?
Both Roz and Nick Huntley's cars have shown up all over town, but both their movements check out only with their known haunts -- home, work.
I reckon Roz knows the locations of the ANPR cameras.
Yeah.

We're now going through all the CCTV and traffic cameras ourselves.
God.

Jodie.
They're still after you, ma'am.
'I thought you should know that AC-12...' have just requested access to Tim's flat.
Thank you, Jodie.
Right...
This is where Tim's body was found.
There was that one interesting piece of forensics the, er...
Here.

Someone went to a lot of trouble to make that appear it was Tim's blood.
I mean, why not just wipe it up like the rest?
Yeah, it's a tiny speck of blood.
I mean, on the night of the murder, the killer, he mops up all these pools of blood, but mind you, this is easily missed.
Yeah, then maybe Huntley spotted it when she returned to the crime scene a few days later to investigate the murder.
When she saw it, she got scared that it could have been
- her husband's blood, or hers.

The place was crawling with FIs and coppers.
And the only way she could have tampered with this particular evidence
- is when it got back to the station.

And she needed access to the evidence that she'd disposed of because that is the only source of Tim's blood.
- Yeah, Steve.

Roz Huntley's movements.
- Concentrate on the day you found Tim Ifield's body.

'Yeah, the 23rd straight through to the early hours of the morning' of the 24th, that's the window, that's when she had to play her hand.
The 23rd of March, 15.00 onwards, through to the early hours of the 24th.
Roz Huntley's car, Tim Ifield's flat.

Come in.
Thank you for coming to me.
There are restrictions on you visiting Polk Avenue while inquiries are ongoing.
I hope you're not too uncomfortable here, ma'am.
The searches are nearly done, so you should be able to go home soon.
You told me to contact you if I remembered anything unusual
- about my husband's behaviour the night of Tim's murder.

The following morning he was unloading the washing machine.
But there was only one item that I could make out.
A navy jumper.
We've seized all your husband's clothing from your address, so we'll see if we can track down this navy jumper.
Thank you.

Thanks, ma'am.
Steve, you're going to want to hear this -- we've got the results from the lab.
Examination of the wool fibres detected postmortem in
Tim Ifield's nose found they were overgrown with MRSA.
Whole genome sequencing proves the organism is indistinguishable from the strain of MRSA swabbed from Roz Huntley's infected wound.
Sorry, but this only provides evidence that Roz Huntley was involved in a struggle with Tim on some occasion before he died.
What if Nick Huntley walked in on their struggle?
I mean, he could still be the killer.
- We're closer, but we're not there yet.

Hello.
Yes, superintendent, yes, yes.
Yes, thank you.

What is it, sir?
Murder Squad have just sent a piece of Nick Huntley's clothing in for urgent forensic analysis.
They've got another 12 hours to hold him.
This is it, guys, make or break.
Sir.
They don't need to be able to fully prove you're guilty, that's for trial.
They just need to cross a threshold of credible evidence, and in their eyes Roz is a credible witness.
They're all on her side, the lot of them.
I got them to bring in an independent team, Nick.
There were anti-corruption officers,
- Roz was scared of them, they kept coming after her.

Get them involved, please, Jimmy, just get them on the case.
OK.
- I'm going to lose everything.

Sorry.
Re impartiality, I could speak to my Chief Super if you think there's anything else we could be doing?
No.

Great.
Yeah.
Sir?
Switch the light on there.

What is it?
- We've got something else, sir.

Sir.
Roz Huntley's car on the afternoon of the 23rd of March.
And this is after she'd left the crime scene when Tim Ifield's body was first discovered.
And she's heading in the direction of home.
That's Roz Huntley at Polk Avenue.
And for some reason she's decided to come in to the station late that night.
Sir, you remember we impounded Roz Huntley's phone to look for
GPS data the night of Tim Ifield's murder?
Well, she switched off her phone at a crucial period, so we couldn't place her at Tim's flat.
Now, fortunately we got access to the phone after the 24th, so the movements we've just seen here are stored on the phone.
And?
And GPS data confirms that she went home after leaving Tim's flat.
It also confirms that she travelled from home to Polk Avenue as seen here.
However, Huntley switched off her phone at 01.00 on the 24th to 04.00 when she set off from home to Polk Avenue.
And that's the exact same precaution she took to cover her tracks
- when she went to Tim's flat on the night of the murder.

A body's been found, you're the SIO, you wouldn't switch off your phone, not in a million years.
She was definitely up to something.
Yeah.

Sir, we've got a window of only three hours to look at.
I mean, there's a chance we'll spot where she went to in that time.
Good work.

We've got a new window between 01.00 and 04.00 hours on the 24th.
We're looking for any sightings of DCI Huntley's vehicle.
What she did, where she went.
This is the final push.

For the DIR, DC Antonioni is showing the interviewee item reference TRH-7.
TRH-7 is a man's navy blue jumper.
Whose clothing is this, Mr Huntley?
It could be mine, I don't know, it could be someone else's.
'Sweat deposits and skin cells detected on the collar match your DNA.'
Like I said, it could be...
It could be mine...
I'm going to read from a report just received from our forensic scientist.
"In addition, human hair bearing follicular cells
"was detected on TRH-7.
"DNA matched a control sample relating to Timothy Ifield..."
No!

".. with greater than 99.9% probability."
I never met Timothy Ifield!

So you're admitting it's your clothing?
I'd like some time in private to confer with my client.
21.25, stopping the tape.
What is it?
We've found Roz Huntley's car in the early hours of the 24th.
2.45am. She's coming off the A38 heading north on the A51.
Out towards the Chase.
No cameras out there.
No cameras, and a huge radius for the search area.
It's an impossibly large area, sir.
If she disposed of evidence, we can't prove it.
And without that evidence, we don't know if Roz really was the killer.
- Sorry, sir.

I'm proud of both of you.
Thank you.

Right, everyone.

Jodie?
I'm afraid so, ma'am.
The CPS agreed that the threshold test had been met.
Your husband's been charged with Tim Ifield's murder and he's going to be remanded.
And they're also looking at him in connection with
Leonie Collersdale's disappearance and Hana Reznikova's abduction.
'You still there, ma'am?

Thank you, Jodie.
I have to be strong, for my children.
Gate, please.
- Kate.

Roz Huntley ventured miles from home, but we know she still made it back by four am.
That's massive travel time.
She only gave herself a few minutes to actually dispose of the evidence.
- And it's three am.

- the evidence to be an easy find in broad daylight.

The only reason she'd risk travelling so far is if she knows precisely where she's going.
I doubt she's ever dumped evidence before.
But she's searched for it.
We're looking for a search Roz Huntley's team carried out where the evidence was so well-hidden it took a very long time to find.
But concentrate in and around the Chase, within a 20-mile radius of Roz Huntley's last known position at 03.00 on the 24th.
Find Huntley's destination.
So the searches are all complete.
You can have your own rooms again, that's better, isn't it?
Right, that's yours.
I'll make us a nice breakfast, yeah?
They still love their dad.
Ma'am... .. I found the information you were requesting.
The telecoms activity around the time of the attack on DS Arnott.
I doubt it matters any more.
Is there anything else I can do?
Thanks, Jodie
Two years ago, Roz Huntley's team investigated a domestic murder.
The boyfriend always denied involvement and it was looking like he was going to get away with it due to lack of evidence, until his bloodstained clothing was found in this area.
All PolSA searches had failed.
It was a chance finding by a member of the public.
The murderer confessed to dumping the evidence in this area.
Right.

Sir.

Oh, right.
Leave this to me.

I have to remind you, sir, you've been served a Regulation 15 notice.
I was aware of that.

Sir, if I've been insubordinate, I've acted alone.
My officers are simply following orders.
Round up your team and leave this to Murder Squad.
Sir!
There's a patch of ground, it looks like it's recently been dug up.
- Put a cordon around it.

- Carry on.

I'll see you at the hearing.
Don't expect it to go well...

Roseanne Huntley, you're under arrest.
You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence
- if you do not mention...

Anything I say, I say to AC-12.
Are you expecting someone else?
Erm...
DC Jodie Taylor.

I was worried that if you knew it was me, you would have turned me down.
I'm under arrest.
Oh, my God!
I want you to represent me.
I would have turned you down, Roz.
There's a clear conflict of interest with Nick.
Please, Jimmy... .. just for a few hours.
You're the only person I trust right now.
'We'll be referring to evidence uncovered on the Queen's Chase woodland, 'in a remote area excavated in conjunction with Murder Squad.'
Item reference YLM-1.
YLM-1 is a rucksack found buried in a shallow pit.
Skin cells detected on the zip fasteners of YLM-1 and follicular hair cells found in the front compartment both match control samples relating to Timothy Ifield.
We believe YLM-1 belonged to Timothy Ifield.
Image 25 shows item reference YLM-5 to YLM-8, items of bloodstained female clothing found in a rucksack buried on the Chase.
The bloodstains match control samples relating to Timothy Ifield.
The quantity of blood deposited indicates these items of clothing were in close contact with Timothy Ifield as he bled to death.
These items of clothing bear DNA deposits matching an individual whose DNA profile is held on the police database.
Do you have anything to say at this point, DCI Huntley?
No comment.
Image 32.

YLM-9 and 10, a grey tracksuit composed of fibres matching those detected on a hanger found at Tim Ifield's flat.
It also bears traces of DNA matching the same individual as the set of bloodstained clothing.
And this grey tracksuit was stolen by the killer at the scene of the crime and then worn to dump the bloodstained clothing that would have connected him... or her to the murder.
On screen, image 19, showing item reference MRT-6.
MRT-6 is a forensic oversuit.
Blood deposited on MRT-6 matches control samples relating to
Timothy Ifield.
Only one other person's DNA was detected on this item.
MRT-3, a balaclava, MRT-4, a jacket, MRT-5, gloves -- all these items bear traces of Timothy Ifield's DNA.
It would appear Ifield was also equipping himself to simulate the appearance of Balaclava Man.
Or Occam's Razor -- he was Balaclava Man.
Image 51 and 52, items BTW-1 and BTW-2, a mobile phone and a laptop computer.
Both match models registered to Timothy Ifield.
Both severely corroded by acid, rendering their hard drives unreadable.
Skin cells matching to Timothy Ifield were detected on the phone's touch ID sensor.
Some of these cells show a chemical profile suggesting they'd been deposited after his death.
It seems the murderer used the amputated fingers to work the phone.
Image 88.

RN-1 was recovered from the cache of evidence found buried on Queen's Chase.
RN-1 is a power saw.
Deposits of Timothy Ifield's blood were detected on the blade.
So the killer did not go armed to Tim's flat.
That saw was already there, and we know that because Tim had bought some power tools at a DIY store.
Image 93.

CED-2 are the amputated fingertips of the second, third and fourth digits of the right hand.
They're a DNA match to Timothy Ifield.
The saw blade bears cells matching these fingers.
It was used to amputate the fingers shortly after Tim Ifield's death.
Biological material detected under the nails of the amputated fingers matches the DNA of the same person whose DNA was found on the bloodstained female clothing.
Tim was dying.
His last act was to claw at the murderer's hand to capture their DNA under his fingernails.
So not only do we have the murderer's DNA... .. but we have the exact strain of bacteria detected on Tim that was grown from the wound that he inflicted on his killer.
Now, do you have anything to say now, DCI Huntley?
At this point, I have to declare a conflict of interest.
As Mrs Huntley is likely to state she was present, possibly unwillingly, and that the actual murder was committed by my client, Nicholas Huntley, in which case Mrs Huntley requires alternative legal representation.
I'm afraid you'll have to pause the interview there.
I confess to accidently killing Timothy Ifield.
Roz... 'you don't have to say anything.'
'His blood's all over my clothes.'
My DNA in his fingernails.
Our children will need a parent.
I acted alone.
My husband took no part.
My witness testimony was false 'and I withdraw it.'
Tim's DNA found on my husband's clothes was planted by me a few minutes after my husband's arrest using a hair brush that I stole from Tim Ifield's flat the morning after his death.
All proceedings against Nick Huntley should be stopped.
So Tim Ifield blew the whistle on you, but you concealed your movements that night.
Was it your pre-meditated intention to harm Timothy Ifield?
I went to Tim's flat to challenge him, that's all.
I covered my tracks purely in case he decided to raise an official complaint.
Things became heated.
There was a struggle.
I hit my head.

And when I came round, he was in his forensic oversuit.
I was laid out on plastic sheeting... .. and he had tools to dismember my body.
Are you telling me that one of our most experienced FIs didn't know that you weren't dead?
He must have tried to find a pulse and, when he failed, he jumped to the conclusion that it wasn't there.
And when I came round, he panicked, and when I tried to fight back, he panicked even more.
He knew I'd be able to accuse him of attempted murder.
And we struggled over the saw.
It was an accident.
I was trying to wrestle it free...
.. when it nicked his neck.
It was like slow-motion.
That first trickle of blood and then a surge.
He bled out all over himself, all over me.
He clawed at my hand and then he was dead.
As a police officer, it was your lawful duty to report that death.
I honestly did think about calling it in and telling the truth.
But I know the law.
How hard it is to prove self-defence.
I've seen a thousand crime scenes and no-one, no-one leaves that with their life intact.
Tim was gone.
I couldn't save his life, but I could try to save mine.
So you cleaned up the crime scene?
Yes.
But you were disturbed the next morning by Hana Reznikova?
I saw her on Tim's computer.
He had that stupid surveillance system of his.
How could you access the computer?
It was just an automatic feed.

So you used his finger to activate the fingerprint ID on his phone?
One of the amputated fingers.
That enabled me to text Hana.
Tell her to go away.
I found a notes file on his phone, with passwords, and that meant that I could use those to take control of his phone and computer.
You waited before disposing of the evidence?
Rash actions in the first few hours are the downfall of most offenders.
I thought I could think of everything.
What you did think of was blaming everybody else, but yourself, including your own husband.
You've tried to frame Michael Farmer, an innocent, vulnerable suspect, not to mention Hana Reznikova.
And you've cast unwarranted aspersions on the integrity of AC-12, and myself.
Justice could not have been further from your thoughts.
Well, here's justice...
Roseanne Huntley... .. I shall now be seeking the authority of the Crown Prosecutor to charge you with these offences -- the murder of Timothy Ifield and perverting the course of justice.

Yes, sir, I do.
At this point, I'd like to stress that on the night of
Timothy Ifield's death, Mrs Huntley was in a state of shock and fear and experienced a momentary loss of control.
I'll be recommending a plea of manslaughter based on those grounds.
- Trust me, Roz.

In fact, when DS Arnott informed Nick that he was going to interview him in connection with Tim's death, who was the first person that Nick called?
Not me.
Am I still a police officer?
Yes, for the moment.
Thank you, sir.
James Lakewell, you do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you fail to mention when questioned something you later rely on in court.
Anything you do say may be used in evidence.
Now...

'My colleague, DC Taylor, 'sourced telecommunications records from the 6th of April.'
The day that DS Arnott was assaulted at my husband's office building.
Nick received an incoming call to his registered mobile from DS Arnott.
Immediately afterwards he made a call to Mr Lakewell's registered phone.
This call lasted approximately five minutes.
Nick was seeking my legal advice.
I asked DC Taylor to look into calls made between unregistered mobiles -- burner phones of the type used for illicit activity in the vicinity of your office.
She identified the following call made from this unregistered mobile, just a few minutes after the call between you and Nick.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't see the relevance.
I'm sure you will once AC-12 have had a chance to analyse the calls and movements made by the burner phone detected at your office.
It's going to match your known movements and activities.
I think I should leave.
I think you should sit down, fella, or I'll handcuff you to that desk.
Sit down.
The call James Lakewell made was received by another burner phone.
This second burner phone made a call immediately afterwards to a third burner phone.
Please, let's look at this third burner phone.
Said phone is no longer active, but using historical triangulation data we were able to track the phone's movements.
The call was received in the Moss Heath area and the phone proceeded directly to the location where DS Arnott was assaulted a few minutes later.
The third burner phone belonged to the man who abducted Hana, who planted evidence in Michael Farmer's house and who assaulted DS Arnott.
Balaclava Man.
James Lakewell defended Michael Farmer at his first offence.
I knew nothing about it, you've got to believe me.
It was Jimmy who served up Michael Farmer to be framed, not by me, but by the people who are really behind this cover-up.
Which brings us to the second burner phone, the one that received
Jimmy Lakewell's call on the 6th of April and contacted Balaclava Man.
Item reference RH-1.
This is a napkin from the Kingsgate Hotel.
The man who gave it to me used the number for what I believed at the time was limited to illicit sexual activity.
This is the number that got the call from James Lakewell and passed the information to Balaclava Man.
It belongs to Assistant Chief Constable Derek Hilton.
Jesus Christ.
'James Lakewell, you are under arrest for' perverting the course of justice.
This interview is now terminated.
Steve, hold him until we can arrange custody.

- Secure these exits.

All right.

Door shut.

Yeah.

There was a conspiracy.
I was never in on it.
I thought I was playing them, but I was the one being played.
That's half the story.
Hilton counted on you putting your career ahead of the truth.
Jimmy set me up with Hilton.
He knew how desperate I was to close the case, and how open I was to being pressurised.
No-one needed me to point that out.
Tim Ifield dead, Michael Farmer and Hana Reznikova in prison.
From where I'm sitting, it looked like you made those choices all by yourself.
I'm not a bad person.
Maybe you would have done the same if you'd been in my situation.
I'd have stopped sooner.
I'd be able to walk and you'd have two hands.
Remain seated.
- Four, go.

So who's Balaclava Man?
Balaclava Men, plural.
If you don't do their bidding, a body gets taken out of cold storage with your DNA all over it.
You think Hilton's top dog?
How come he bricks it every time a new body's found?
Tell us who he is.

There are some people there's no immunity from.
Thanks for holding them.

Taking him where?
Protective custody.

I'll need to run that by the gaffer.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, good to go up here.

Steve.
Sir, just to let you know,
AC-9 are here to take Lakewell into protective custody.
Hilton's been tipped off.

Will do.

AC-12.

Yeah, all good.
Good.
Yeah, we're on our way down.
Turn around, please.
Where am I going exactly?
I am not at liberty to disclose.
What about me?
A different custody location.

You'll want the DIR disk.

No.

Standby for further instructions, yeah?
What's wrong with this thing, man?
Slow this time of night.
What the hell are you trying to do?
Listen to me, Jamie, we know someone tipped off Hilton.
He sent you, didn't he?
- I just need this lift working, mate.

And you need to wake up, mate.

Hilton's never going to let that happen.
I bet you he even told you what route to take, didn't he?
No prizes for guessing what's going to happen in transit.
You'll just be collateral damage.
I'm not going anywhere.
Come on, we're taking the stairs.
And you're talking bollocks.
Right, Hilton's got my back, 110%.
That's exactly what he said to me.
You walk out of here, you're a dead man.
Hello!
Something's not right, sir.
Armed Police!
- Come on!

Don't do this, Jamie!
Jamie, don't...
Jamie, there's still a way out for you.
Don't trust the wrong man.

Back!

Cooperate with our inquiry into Hilton and you're in the clear, but that's only if no-one gets hurt!
- There's no way out!

Drop it!
All you've got to do is give me the firearm.
Right.

Get the medics to that man.
Just give me the firearm.
- Armed Police!

- Don't shoot!

Drop the firearm, Jamie.
Do as he says, Jamie.

There's a fella lying dead downstairs cos he didn't cooperate.
Don't test us, Jamie.
Come on, mate, give me the gun.
All right.
Just give me the gun.
Cuff him.
No sign of a struggle, no evidence anyone else was here, sir.
Suicide.
Well, you might not recognise this location, but a body was found here, Oliver Stephens-Lloyd, a social worker trying to blow the whistle on child sexual exploitation.
His death was made to look like suicide too.
We know Hilton had been tipped off.
He could have easily have made a run for it.
Or he knew the game was up.
Right.

The man you shot in the lobby, sir, he's been identified as a known violent criminal with long-term associations going all the way back to Tommy Hunter.
Activity on Balaclava Man's burner phone matches all his known haunts.
His biometrics are an exact match to the images of Balaclava Man captured on the night of Leonie Collersdale's disappearance and the day of the attack on Steve.
Even down to his boot print.
You got him, sir.
I got one of them.
There may be others still at large.

And the consistent method has been to exploit vulnerable young women to blackmail officers into fearing they'd be incriminated in serious offences.
They had that hold over Hilton too.
Whether or not he was "H."
Meaning he wasn't top dog.
Top in the police.
But not among the real criminals.
What, bent coppers not criminal enough for you, son?
Sir.
I'm satisfied "H" was ACC Hilton.
Take my photograph down off that board, Kate.
This is beginning to feel like a life's work.
Left.
Stop.
Turn.
