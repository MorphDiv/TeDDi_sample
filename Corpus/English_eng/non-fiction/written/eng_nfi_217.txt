I know you are not going to believe what I have to say.
Previously on Greenleaf...
I didn't come here to cause you any trouble.
Does Jabari perform with all his artists like that?
Charity, is there something going on between you two?
I think I found a silver bullet for that werewolf Basie Skanks.
Aaron's flying in from Nashville.
Come here, boy.
I worshipped the ground that man walked on, and all he ever had to do was just say, "Good job, son."
Instead what I get... "Gigi would have done it better."
I wasn't quite feeling the Word today, Jacob."
Do you have to go back to work after this,
Thought you might wanna blow off some steam.
Morning.
Hey, what are you doing up so early?
Praying.
Brother.
It says "flip the yellow switch."
I just did that, Riss, twice.
Let me see this thing.
I just told you I already did that.
I keep thinking this place can't get any worse, and every day, I am proven wrong.
We can't keep calling your family's handyman every time something goes wrong around here.
I mind.
You don't think your mother hears about it every time he comes over here?
He might not charge us, but believe me, those courtesy calls are anything but free.
Pastor Skanks, good morning.
Tell me you didn't know about this.
I didn't know about this.
What don't I know about?
This injunction your father's filed against your church.
Construction's been halted for 28 days.
No, I didn't know about that.
I'll be right over.
No, don't come to Triumph.
All right, well, where you wanna meet?
Cavalry.
We gonna settle this with the bishop once and for all.
So, are you gonna tell me or not?
Cavalry filed an injunction to stop construction at the church.
Basie's on his way over to Cavalry right now to fight it.
Now, this balcony is the perfect place to unwind with a Bible or take a leisurely breakfast.
It's beautiful.
Yeah, well, the view isn't as picturesque as the one from the balcony of your family's place in Captiva,
I know, but it has its countrified charm.
I'll be out here every morning.
Well, I hope that's true.
Sometimes, I confess,
I feel like I'm the only person here who still really appreciates the beauty of this place.
How Jacob was able to leave it behind as a thing of no value is beyond me.
We'll get him back soon enough.
I pray you're right.
But in the meantime, protecting this house is our first priority, because if Calvary fails, we'll probably have to sell this place to settle the books.
I won't let that happen.
Should I have Maricel bring up some coffee and a newspaper?
Because I know your father loves his crossword puzzles.
No, no, that's okay, Mrs. Greenleaf.
I should get a jump on things.
Well, all right, but first, I want to show you the pool because, as I recall, you are an avid swimmer.
Hey, so what'd they say?
Just, you know, it's probably viral, so antibiotics won't help.
Even if they're right, I just hate how judgy they are.
Like me wanting my son to feel better is a failing on me.
I'm sure that's not what they meant.
Kevin, are you busy this morning?
I'm supposed to meet Jabari to look at options for cover art.
And then he's leaving, so it's our last day.
I can move some things around.
Yeah, and I'll take him this afternoon.
Yeah, yeah, but take your time.
I wanna hang with him as much as I can before... you know.
Who knows?
You'll be able to see him whenever you want.
I know.
Just we need to actually talk soon so we can figure out how this all is gonna work out.
I know, and we will tonight.
I promise.
You gonna go with Daddy?
There you go.
Thank you.
Yeah.
It's okay.
This is your first wedding since you came back, isn't it?
Yeah, your granddad needed a break.
Think you'll ever get married?
It's not on my to-do list.
Darius?
Is just a friend.
I'm not the one sneaking in at 5:00 in the morning.
And we're not sleeping together, not that that's any of your business.
So, what do you two do all night?
Well, we talk, mostly.
Yeah, about what?
Honestly?
Yeah.
How to put Mac away for good.
Ever think...
"Maybe I should just pray for him and give it to God?"
No.
And if I ever did, I'd take one look at you and get right back on that horse.
This isn't about punishment, baby.
As long as he's free, he's a danger to girls like you.
And I can't have that.
I'd better get going.
Okay.
Say "hey" to Pastor Ramona for me.
The Hicksons are in your office.
I thought they were supposed to meet me down here.
An issue.
The day before the wedding.
That is when the issues come up.
Yeah, I saw she got baptized during the revival.
You must be so proud.
I'm definitely interested to see what she's gonna do with it.
Well, if she's anything like Vida was when she got baptized, get ready for a season of righteousness.
By the way, did you ask Vida?
She just doesn't want to deal with the police again.
She wants to move on.
Okay.
You know, a phone call, you can ignore.
A human being, you got to deal with.
I'm just thinking barging in like this without warning...
The element of surprise is working in your favor.
You're much more likely to get an undefended response.
Anyhow, fortune favors the bold.
Charge!
Pastor Greenleaf.
Pastor Skanks.
This is how the Bible says to handle disputes anyways,
Christian to Christian, not rifling through.
Caesar's playbook for his poisons.
All the time.
Bye now.
Well, they can just walk right on out.
Unless they're here to surrender.
Quite the opposite.
Go on, speak your piece.
Sorry, Pop, I...
Give me that thing.
What kind of a father does this to his only son without salvation for all humanity hanging in the balance?
Did you break his toys when he was a baby?
'Cause something tells me you did.
Jacob, take this creature outside.
No, he's not going anywhere, and neither am I, sir.
Not until this matter is peacefully and spiritually resolved.
Then post up because it's gonna take... 28 days.
At least.
The most important thing is that I love you.
That is not the most important thing, Preston.
The most important thing is whether you love God.
Before we start waving around our loaded Bibles...
We were talking about schools last night
Why are we even talking about this?
It's so early.
Some of those waiting lists are four years out,
I just think that it would be easier for them to make an informed decision if they started in a secular school.
What do they need to be informed about besides the cross?
I don't want to be unequally yoked.
Yes, I'm familiar with that verse, but...
Gosh.
We'll come back to it after.
Yeah.
Simone?
Fine.
I can see you love each other.
This is gonna be all right.
What do you think of that one?
That's kind of gloomy for a gospel record.
It shows you're, like, for real.
Well, you know best.
Then we'll go with that one.
And don't worry, you'll have a chance to say no one last time
This is it.
I trust you.
You know, I know you did this record as a one-time thing for the church.
You should be doing this professionally full-time.
Calvary pays me pretty well.
No, no, no, I mean writing.
I know people in Nashville that make a million a year that can't write a song like you by a long shot.
I don't do it for money.
I know, and that's why you're good.
I got a publishing company.
We can start out slow with a deal to write songs, see where it leads.
I'd line you up with other songwriters, boom, boom, boom.
It'd be fun, if nothing else.
Let me pray about it.
That's the right answer.
Well... see you at the release party.
See you at the release party.
You'll never know how much this meant to me.
You made me believe in myself again, my value.
Thank you.
It was my pleasure.
Hey, Mom.
Well, I hope I wasn't interrupting anything.
No, we were just saying goodbye.
Is that a new jacket?
No, I've had this for years.
I'll, put the final mixes in your Dropbox and send you the layouts.
Thank you.
Ma'am.
Well, that was quite an embrace.
Grateful.
Yes, grateful, Mama.
Just grateful.
Well, be careful.
Take it from a woman who knows.
Mama...
I should probably tell you so you don't get the wrong idea.
What is it, dear?
Kevin and I are breaking up.
I'm sorry.
You know we've been having problems.
Yes, I know.
But marriage?
Marriage you can bend.
You can bend it until it's all knotted up like some seaweed from the swamp.
But you break it... break it... and that's a loss.
I don't think we can stay married, Mama.
Well, I'm not saying you should, but I highly recommend that you and Kevin just sit down with your father and me, and talk about it before you make a final decision.
Okay.
You never want sadness like this for your children, but it comes.
Come here, baby.
Hello, you've reached Aaron Jeffries, acting general counsel for Cavalry Fellowship World...
If you are satisfied with your greeting, press...
Basie Skanks just marched into my office like some angry baseball manager hot out of the dugout in the bottom of the ninth in game seven.
What does he want?
He says he wants to resolve this, but we know and he knows there can be no resolution as long as this stunt is being pulled.
So, then what is he doing here?
I guess he's trying to put on some kind of shadow puppet show for Jacob, doing whatever he can to draw that boy even further from me and this family.
So, what do you want to do?
You tell me.
Do we call the police?
No, no, you don't want that attention.
Well, I'm not about to dignify this home invasion with a sit-down.
Can you wait him out?
My father says there's one thing the devil can't brook, and it's being ignored.
Hello, you've reached Aaron Jeffries, acting...
If you are satisfied with your greeting...
What is the Wi-Fi password?
I can't find a signal to save my life.
Look, let's just go back to Triumph.
I'm sure there's a way around this.
So what?
This church, that church, this injunction... that's not what this is about.
This is about manhood, brother.
It's about fighting to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of you.
Then fight for your church.
What's the Wi-Fi password?
I'm gonna have to excuse myself this afternoon to attend a meeting with the deacons, so whatever effect you two think this little sit-in is having after 4:00 PM will be wasted.
That's a little FYI.
May I speak to you privately?
I know, Karine explained.
So how's that hot water problem?
Stan mentioned that it might require...
Come on.
What foolishness.
What hot water problem?
Nothing.
It's nothing.
What is your plan here, James?
We have the deacon board coming later.
We finally have a chance to give them some good news after all of that drought, and I don't want those two jokers here skulking.
Now, we may have to negotiate.
Can you imagine the hay that Fred Williams could make over this?
Okay, I'll see that they're gone, dear.
Now, what did you need me for?
Come.
Charity just told me that she and Kevin are divorcing.
I thought things were going well.
Apparently not.
What is the problem with those two?
She wouldn't say.
But I'm fairly sure that it has something to do with that music man.
Whatever it is, this family cannot take another scandal right now.
And whatever happens, I want to make sure that we are fully protected.
From whatever drama those two cook up.
I mean, listen, you know how messy those things can be.
And, yes, if it comes to it, Kevin.
All right, I'll...
I'll check into it, okay?
Hey, little man.
I will never leave you.
And since you chose to write your own,
I'll say, "And now the couple has written their own vows", which they will now share."
Preston, you wanna go first?
You want me to say the vows now?
Yeah, unless you want to surprise her.
No, let's make sure that she's on board with everything that I'm gonna say.
That sounds smart.
It's not like I'm hard to please.
No one said you were.
And we can talk about the rest later.
Simone... today I am glad because I believe that God has ordained our love.
I promise to love you as Christ loved the church...
Please, let's just get through this.
Simone, honey...
Hey, K.
I thought you were the electrician.
Well, if you really need one, we'll call one.
But what's the issue now, princess?
Well, the kitchen outlets.
Well, have you tried resetting the breaker?
Yeah, yeah, but now that whole wall is dead.
Have you been running the heater again?
I know you like it all cozy up in here.
I have not been running the heater, but we should be able to have warm air and a refrigerator at the same time.
Okay, well, listen to you, sounding like the Israelites in the desert whining to Moses.
You wanna go back to Egypt, too?
No, I just want a house that works.
Okay.
So serious.
All right, let's see what we can do.
Let's do... this should work.
Okay, well, let me try one more thing.
No.
Well...
Is that... who's that?
That's my daddy, Darryl James.
Handsome man.
You played baseball, right?
Shortstop.
Baseball was the only thing my daddy and I had in common.
The year he died, PONY league had just come around and he signed me up.
Inside of it was a brand-new uniform.
The DeLancey Orioles, 24.
I was so excited, I fell asleep that night wearing it.
In the morning, my mama woke me up.
I knew something was wrong 'cause she brought me hot cocoa.
I knew you only get hot cocoa on special occasions.
She... she sat me up, looked me in my eyes, gave me the mug, and said, "Basie..."
your daddy's gone.
He got caught in a fire last night at the church,
"and he didn't make it out."
I know you think I'm crazy.
But that night, something broke in my life, in my mama's life, in Bishop's life, and maybe yours.
And all I'm trying to do is put it back together the way God told me.
So God told you to drag my daddy down?
No.
He told me to lift you up.
Would you gentlemen be so kind as to meet me in the conference room?
See?
The table's set.
The only question now is what are you serving?
Bottom line, what I really want to leave y'all with... and this should be a source of comfort... is this.
You can't take yo baptism back.
The day you dipped yourself in that water, you crossed a spiritual threshold.
I know people who've been baptized 10 times.
You might be one of those folks, always needing to get their batteries recharged.
What you'll never be again is someone who wasn't baptized.
You've passed the point of no return.
There's no going back.
Praise the Lord, you've reached Aaron Jeffries,
If you are satisfied with your greeting, press...
Whatever it takes to get them out the door.
Is there any way possible that's there's some other reason why you're scared to get married and this drama is just an excuse?
Well, this issue with Preston.
Can I be straight with you?
Please.
We wanted the bishop to do this wedding.
He married my sister and her husband, and people still talk about that sermon.
They're still quoting it on Facebook.
He has a way with words.
And a lot of other things, too.
When we found out that the bishop was unavailable and we would be getting you instead, I lived with it, but you never would have been my first choice, ever.
Okay.
Because I heard that you were a preacher, and you just quit.
And I'll never understand how a real Christian could do that.
I could walk you through it.
Don't.
I'm...
I'm pretty sure that whatever your reasons are won't hold up to much scrutiny.
I'm sorry.
Simone, baby, come on.
I can't, Preston.
It's not your fault.
All right, I'll talk to Basie about getting DeMarco over here to rewire the house, although, I honestly don't think that this is the right time to be spending on luxuries.
How is having two working outlets in a kitchen a luxury, Tasha?
Well, it's... it's not.
It's just the situation Basie and I are in...
What situation?
I know about that high-rise you guys live in.
And, look, I don't need you to yell at me.
I'm just trying to explain that...
No, this is not me yelling, Tasha.
This is me being clear!
I know you get some strange pleasure out of treating me like I think that I am all that, but I have never suggested that I think that I am all that!
And all I am asking for on their behalf is a hot stove, safe food, and to not have blue fire leaping out at me from the walls every time I go to plug something in!
I said I'm sorry, Kerissa!
I don't know where we're gonna get the money.
I don't...
Just come over here and sit down, sit down.
Sit down.
I don't know what to do.
Considering I've been paying Stan's invoices for all the work he's been doing at your house, whatever you can do to bring this to a hasty conclusion would be appreciated.
Well, here we are.
As ministers of the gospel, I think we should be able to settle this without a lawyer, don't you?
Brother, would you mind?
If you leave the premises upon the conclusion of this meeting, within seven days we'll agree to enter binding arbitration.
And if, in the judgment of a court-appointed arbiter, the environmental concerns upon which the injunction is based have been addressed or deemed to be somehow frivolous,
The studies that would have to be completed to satisfy that sophistry you just dropped would take 28 days or more, and you know it.
How does it feel now, Pastor?
Can I say something?
It's his permission you need to ask for, Jacob, not mine.
This man's father is dead.
When I found out that you, supposedly a man of God, gave the order to burn your own church...
See, Pastor Skanks here and I have that in common.
We both lost our fathers that night.
It just took me a little longer to find out than him.
And, Aaron?
I know they drew you into this, and I still consider you a friend, but I warn you, to get in the way of a church that the Lord wants to build is a bad place to stand.
Take care you don't say something to us...
Mama, I love you, but keep your peace.
Because all these years you've been taking my side with one hand in his pocket, you're gonna pay for it.
'Cause as... as we all know,
God doesn't hate His children.
But when you see what I can do without any help from you, you're gonna mourn the pride you could have felt in me when all you had was pity and some agitation for grace.
And now I pity you.
'Cause you can't raise me any higher.
But I can still grow up.
Looks like we're leaving.
I can't say I'm disappointed.
There's something antique about this place.
Airless.
Like a tomb.
I mean it and I don't use this word lightly that was a miracle, a flat-out miracle.
Check your shoes, my guess is they're two sizes bigger than when you woke up.
Look, you don't have to apologize.
I appreciate everything you've done to lift me up, but we both know this is not just about me.
You should have seen this man.
Sure.
See you tomorrow.
Pastor.
Why are you doing this?
So you're gonna preach across the street from Daddy's church?
Jacob, it's just...
It's just what?
It's just so childish.
Okay.
You knew what Uncle Mac was doing to Faith, and you left.
So who are you to say anything to anybody?
I never wanted to say that.
But for you to say anything to me besides,
"Thank you for not hating me after I came home and stole your whole life right out from under you,"
is way out of line.
Neither one of us is exactly where we ought to be.
That's life.
But you don't blame people for that.
Check yourself.
Well, not that you need any more commotion after all that donnybrook, but it's been given to me that...
Kevin and Charity might be divorcing.
Of course, we all still hope that they find a way to work it out, but if they don't, we will be seeking your guidance.
I'll do what I can.
We're so fortunate to have you.
We are.
I'm sorry I got so angry.
I know this place isn't up to code.
It's actually not up to code?
Well, no, I mean figuratively.
When anyone calls me serious, it just sets me off.
I know.
How what's gonna end?
All this mess with Triumph II and...
How do you mean?
All the money that Basie's putting into this and all the side deals that he's making.
What kind of side deals?
What are you talking about?
Nothing, you know, just the commitments.
I'm sure he knows what he's doing, but, you know, a woman worries.
That's what we do, isn't it?
The men folk hurry, and the women worry.
I've never heard that one before.
I'm gonna find the money from somewhere, and we're gonna get you all fixed up.
Okay.
Thank you.
At the tone, record your message.
If you are satisfied with your greeting...
Hey, Kevin, wait up!
Hey, listen, Lady Mae told me that you and Charity might be getting a divorce.
Yeah.
Do you have a lawyer yet?
I assume you don't from the way that you're...
No, I haven't done that yet.
Hey, look, it's no rush.
But here.
When you get one, have him call me.
Or her, whatever the case may be.
Thanks.
Hallelujah!
Now, before we get started, I just want to give a role call of blessings so we all know
After an incredibly successful fall revival,
We've hired a new general counsel,
Mr. Aaron Jeffries, the son of Pastor Lionel Jeffries, whose preaching we all so enjoyed at revival and who has already proved his value 10 times over.
Most importantly, with Mr. Jeffries' help, we have filed an injunction with the court to halt construction on Triumph II for at least one month, and we have reason to believe that we can delay it indefinitely.
Or at least until they get up and run across town.
Amen.
Now, with that in mind, let's get down to business.
And let's keep it short because I ain't gonna lie.
I'm hungry.
The Sunday school conference that we have every year is coming up next month.
You all have in front of you an itemized...
Amen.
It was either lights or dinner, and I went with dinner.
And get this, tomorrow, an electrician is coming by to put a bid together to rewire the whole house.
How'd you pull that off?
I threw a fit.
I knew I married the right woman.
Thank you, Lord.
But there was something that Tasha said, Jacob, in the heat of it.
What, she drop some of her feng shui logic on you?
No, it was about money and Basie.
Do tell.
Knock knock.
Come in.
I was just about to go for a run, but, please, stop me.
I made something, just a little gesture to say thank you.
What is it?
Well... your mother was such an original person.
And she used to make this grapefruit pound cake.
Well, now I have to go for a run.
Well, it won't be as good as hers.
Nonsense, just to try it.
Let's see.
I love it.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Well, I guess I'll just leave you to it.
Mae.
I'll never tell anyone about you and Dad.
What would be the point?
Thank you.
Some people's testimonies were so heavy.
I felt really blessed by the time the workshop was over.
Sounds like a good day.
Can I come to the wedding tomorrow?
I have to write a review of a sermon, and I thought I'd savage yours.
Well, I'd be happy to share my notes with you, honey, but, um... the wedding's been canceled.
Why?
They just decided not to get married.
It's a long and... confidential story.
I hate that.
I don't think it'll help, honey.
Then... let's pray for you.
Seems like a pastor who doesn't believe in the power of prayer could use some.
Okay.
Let's do it.
Dear God, thank you so much for my mom.
She works so hard and fights so hard to do what's right, but she needs some support right now.
Please let her know that You're there for her, waiting whenever she needs you and that no matter what happens...
You love her.
