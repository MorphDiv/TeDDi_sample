*CRIMINAL MINDS* Season 12 Episode 13 "Spencer" Synchronized by srjanapala
There is not a righteous man on earth
Who does what is right and never sins.
Ecclesiastes 7:20.
Hey.
Oye.
I should call my mom.
You need...
Your mommy?
You're gonna need a lot more than that, Vato.
You're American?
Where's your identification?
I don't know.
Your papers?

Something's wrong.

I can't remember anything.
What's your name?
What happened to your hand?
I don't know.
It seems like the kind of thing a person would remember.
It could get infected.
Si.
Thank you.
I should call someone.
You don't get a phone call.
That surprises Americans when they get in trouble here.
But maybe if you help me figure out
Why you had narcotics in your possession,
I can help you notify someone.
You forgot that, too?

What were you doing way out there?
I, uh...
Was meeting someone.
I was meeting a woman.
I'm not usually like this.
Heroin will do that.
I don't use drugs.
You just run them.
You're not high right now?
Why are you in Mexico?
Because I'm trying to...
Help my mom.
Your mother is with you in Mexico?
Mm-mmm.

Rosa.
I'm meeting Rosa, who's a doctor,
So I should find her.
Rosa who?
Where does she live?
I'm sorry, I don't know.
Jefe.
Deme.
Yeah.
You're not just American.
You're Dr. Spencer Reid with the FBI?
Thanks, Cruz.

I know.

What's wrong?
Reid is in jail.
Jail?
In Mexico.
What the hell is he doing down there?
I don't know.

The call came in to Cruz from their lead investigator.
What's he being held for?
Drug possession,
With intent to distribute.
What type of drugs?
Cocaine and heroin.
Oh, my God.
This can't be happening.
We need Lewis and Walker here ASAP.
Yeah.

I'm gonna run some tests to figure out what you're on right now.
Thank you.

We're having a hard time finding this Dr. Rosa.
You still don't remember her last name
Or where you met her?
I'm trying.
When my officers chased you,
You were racing toward the border.
My guess is you planned on crossing it.
Is that true?
No, I, uh...
Think I was chasing someone.
Who?
They were in front of me.
Maybe your officers saw them.
They did.
No one got the tags.
This has to be a mistake.
I think I'm being framed.
You have enemies who would do this?
This has got to be scratch.
He was laying low.

Crossing the border as a fugitive is a huge risk.
The reward is greater.

Now his target is Reid.
Peter Lewis dropped off the map after attacking Tara's family.
Maybe he's been hiding in Mexico this whole time.
We also have to consider this isn't related to him.
Who else would it be?
Drug cartels.
Could have threatened Reid and used him as a mule.
Agreed.

Reid was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Spence's mom is ok.
The home nurse he hired said all is stable.
Oh, thank the stars.
How long did he tell the nurse he'd be gone?
Uh, 3 days.
That sounds reasonable.
After the palm Springs case,
Reid said he had to get back to Houston to talk to his mom's doctor.
Well, Houston is only a 5-hour drive from the border.
Usually I can read him.
I can't believe I didn't pick up on any of this.
He didn't want you to, and there's no way
You would have guessed he'd end up in Mexico.
The question is, why did he go down there?
And why does he have narcotics?
Yeah, exactly.

He wouldn't...

I'm not gonna share any secrets I'm not supposed to, but those drugs were planted on him.
Absolutely.

That's why he crossed the border and kept it a secret.
There's something he didn't want to share with any of you.
Ok, so what would make him risk everything?
His mom.
Yeah, but she's here and she's safe.
Oh, wait.
Cruz just sent me the arresting report.
Hold, please.

O...

It says here that Reid was involved
In a high-speed chase.
What?

None of this sounds like him.
It says he was wearing jeans, he was really confused.

According to the arresting officer, he was really high on something.
No, no, he wouldn't do that.

Who's that?
An offender with D.I.D.
who kidnapped and drugged Reid.
When was this?
10 years ago.
What does the report say about the intent to distribute.
Uh, it says he was charged with constructive possession, and in the duffel bag there was Cocaine, Cash,
And 3 bricks of Heroin.
Ok, we'll be there in less than an hour.
Dave, were you able to reach Jack Garrett?
He's deep in a case, but he promised to do what he can.
Ok.

Oh... please don't.
Please, I don't want it.

Spencer, please go to the other room.
Don't treat him like a child.
I'm not gonna have this conversation in front of him.
I'm not crazy.
If you refuse to take care of yourself, I can't help you.
You're weak.
I'm not weak.
I know, honey.
I'm not weak.
I'm not weak.
I'm not weak.
I'm not weak.
I'm not weak.
You know, we should check with Monty over at I.R.T.
to see how many times Reid has crossed the border.
Our smarts are on the same channel.

Where are you with the searches?
The scratch of it all, I am thus far coming up with nothing.
For all we know, Peter Lewis could be in Mexico
Orchestrating this whole thing.
We're talking about a dude who hacked into DMV records,
And cross that with a cyber wall run by the Mexican drug cartel, which is and even scarier wall of cyber than I'm used to.
What about Reid?
Oh, right.

I.E., I have info on his flight to Houston.
Looks like he checked in and out of a hotel there.
But if he rented wheels to get to Mexico, there's no record of it.
Well, maybe he has a contact down there and he could have borrowed their car.
He could have taken a bus.
There's all kinds of ways to cross the border.
I'll keep looking.

I found a whole lot of articles in medical journals,
No big surprise.
This is all about experimental medicine.
Ok.

I got an email from a librarian friend of mine from the FBI library.

All having to do with alternative medicinal procedures for fighting Alzheimer's.
Well, he told me he was supplementing her meds with omega-3s and making sure
She was eating a ton of leafy Greens.
But he said her prescriptions plus vitamins weren't enough.
Maybe he took it to a new level.
Because it takes years to pass the fda guidelines, a lot of holistic medicine is practiced outside the United States.
Ok, they have landed and they are on the way to Spence.
All right, well, let's start digging through these, see if we can find anything that can help.
Thanks for calling us.
A U.S. fed in our custody isn't something we see every day.
We appreciate you letting us talk to him.
Have you gotten his tox screen panels back yet?
No.
You will need to expedite that.
We have cause to believe that Agent Reid was drugged.
He was definitely high and driving like a maniac with $20,000 worth of heroin in his possession.
Both of which put my officers at risk.
You're in our jurisdiction.
The rules are different here.
We understand.
Hey, Reid.
It's good to see you, brother.
It's me, Luke.
Luke.
Thank you for coming.
Of course.
We're gonna get you out of here, kid.
We need to work out some details with the locals, ok?
Who was your contact down here?
Rosa.
Rosa Medina.

All right.
Where did you meet her?
I don't remember.
If you saw her, would you remember her?
Yeah.

You're missing time, aren't you?
It's peeking out.

And you've been drugged.
Yeah, but I didn't take it myself.
Well, of course you didn't, Spencer.
We're thinking it might be Scratch.
Scratch.
Excuse me.
Alvez:

Is he ok?
Yeah.

I'm not sure he recognizes us.
That could be the drugs.
Would a cognitive help?
I really think we're a little far off for that right now.

But he wrote the name of his local contact,
Rosa Medina, on his arm.
I just sent the pic to Garcia.
He says that she's a doctor.
So his short-term is coming back, but it's limited.
It sounds like his long-term is still a mess.
Ok, this definitely reads chicken scratch, but it's... oh, there are a lot of Rosa Medinas in Mexico.
Well, let's start with women in Houston and Brownsville, and then cross them with Mexican citizens.
Got it.
He told Emily he was gonna talk to his mom's doctor.
If that was true, we all assumed it was the doctor from the clinic, but maybe it was this Rosa Medina.
And she could be being cautious, which is why we haven't been able to find any communication between them.
And why should she be cautious?
Well, because in 2015, 60 holistic doctors across the United States died mysteriously.
Some were accidents, others violent attacks, others were deemed suicide.
Conspiracy theorists believe these doctors were targeted fatally by pharmaceutical companies for their belief in holistic practice.
Well, then Rosa Medina might not be her real name.
You think she might have an alias?
Look, I've seen it plenty of times.
If she's afraid of consequences, maybe she used an anagram.
How many holistic doctors with connections between Texas and Mexico?
Uh, Sophia Flores.
Ana Sorel.
Nadie Ramos.
Juliet Hernandez.
What's the story with Nadie Ramos?
Uh... uh, let's see.
She specializes in experimental drugs that reverse brain degeneration.
Have you got a photo?
Yep.

Hey, the team sent this.
Is this the doctor you met?
Yeah.
Her alias is Rosa Medina.
Her real name is Nadie Ramos.
Garcia tracked her to a motel just outside of town.

No.
We'll need to take Castenada and his officers with us.
You want company here?
No, I'm...

Manager says he hasn't seen her all day.
If she's left town, this won't be good for Reid.
No puede pasar.
Damn, she's dead.
This isn't good.
Tres, cuatro, cinco, seis, siete...
This doesn't look good for your friend.
Come on.

Framed for drugs.

You're not even considering the obvious?
You wouldn't either if you knew Spencer Reid.
We've both got a job to do.
I'll get all this processed.
And we'll continue to fight to prove he's innocent.
Reid's stuff was everywhere.
If they run DNA, he'll be all over this room.
Maybe even on the victim.
The coroner counted over 25 stab wounds.
There's still no sign of the knife?
No.
We've got a disorganized crime scene with the offender aware enough to take the murder weapon with them.
It doesn't add up.
Unless it was a drug-induced kill.
The unsub could have freaked out and taken off with the knife.
Reid told Castenada he was chasing someone.
It could have been the killer.
Yeah.

And Reid's got a nasty cut on his hand.
It could be from the same blade.
He didn't do this.
I know.
But Scratch has done one hell of a job making it look like he did.
How are you holding up?
Well, it's been quite a year, but...
This...
You two are close.
He's my best friend.
Yeah, he's stronger than anyone knows, but... he is not equipped to be locked up.
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but... maybe the drugs are helping with any anxiety.
Well, I thought the same.
I mean, I want him to come down, but then when he's sober, time's gonna stand still and that will drive him crazy.
So Monty tracked Reid's passport.
Turns out he used his personal and not his work issued one, which makes sense, because he wasn't working, right?

Mm, working or not, he should have been briefed before leaving the country and he wasn't.
So on a scale of one to terrible?
It's terrible.
The Bureau's gonna hold it against him.
He violated security protocol.
I mean, as a federal agent, he's a high-value target.
You know this.

Why did he keep us out of this?
I didn't know he crossed the border once, let alone 3 times.
3 times in the last 3 months?

Lying.

We'll, he was making decisions with his heart and not his head.
Which I'm intimately familiar with, but none of this would have happened if he would have let us help.
Well, Penelope, that's what we're gonna do now.

Well, I'm still mad at him.
We know you didn't do this.
How did it happen?
She was stabbed, multiple times.
It looked personal.
We got the results of your blood work.
There's cocaine and heroin in your system.
What else?
He was in possession of cocaine and heroin when he was arrested.

No, I need a full tox screen panel.
We're looking for scopolamine.
That'll take longer.
I don't care.

You were given a speedball.
The opiates block the dopamine.
That's why thing go from clear to hazy.
The combination of the drugs causes a dissociative state and explains the memory loss.
Are you coming down now?
I think so.
Do you think you could do a cognitive interview?
I'll try.
Do you have a quiet room we can use?
Yes.

You recognize them?
I put it in some orange juice so it won't taste so bad.
What is it?
I'm gonna run it through the lab.
Whatever's in those vials, I was giving it to my mom.
That's the only thing I'm sure of.
So Emily said they're gonna try a cognitive, but she isn't very hopeful.
Did they run a full tox screen?
No.

And?
And he tested positive for both.
What?
Well, there's gotta be some other sedative present for him to be missing so much time.
Look, they're only gonna investigate what helps their case, and right now, they have a dead Mexican citizen and a drugged up American suspect.
That's true.

They're only looking at who and what's in front of them.
Ok, but we can't let him get stuck there.
Then we better hope they come up with something useful from this cognitive.
It's a good sign things are coming back.
Ok, so you remember landing in Houston, but you haven't said how you got across the border.
I took a bus to Brownsville.
And walked across.
Is that where you met Rosa?
The first time.
This trip we met in a motel.
Because she doesn't have an office here.
If you'd met Rosa before, why did you write her name on your arm?
I don't know.

Well, it's a good thing you did.
Otherwise we may not have found her.
Maybe that would have been a good thing.
Eventually her body would have been discovered.
When did you first meet her?
Houston.
I met her at Houston and at the clinic.
She wrote an article on Alzheimer's.
And that's why I came here.
Ok.

It's time to close your eyes.
Ok, tell me about her.
She had the vials.
She said that my mom just needed 3 drops a day.
And I thanked her.
Then something...

She was upset, and we were at the window.
What was it?

Yeah.
Ok, can you see them?
No.

The door opened.
They must have knocked me out, 'cause I don't...

I can't... can't remember.

I can't remember anything.

She...
Rosa's on the floor, too, though.
And... someone else is definitely there.
- There's a knife.

There's a knife and there's a lot of blood.
Who has the knife?
Who is stabbing Rosa?
I don't know.
It's in my hand.
You're trying to stop the killer.
Mm-hmm.
I think so.
Reid.
Reid.
Ok.

We need to get you cleaned up.
How's he doing?
He's made some breakthroughs, but I'm not sure how helpful they'll be.
What is it?
They just charged Reid with the murder of Nadie Ramos.
We can't get him out of here, can we?
I don't know how.
He didn't kill her.
If all I had to go on was the evidence,
I would swear he did.
But knowing Reid, hearing the cognitive...
Yes, he said there was another person in that motel room, but...
Who has the knife?
Who is stabbing Rosa?
I don't know.
It's in my hand.
You're trying to stop the killer.
Right now this is just more evidence against him.
Ok, I am obsessively refreshing the Mexican prison logs, and so far Reid is staying put.
But they could transfer him to Santa Adaladia or El Diablo, both of which make Matamoros look like a day spa.
Like a who's who of bad guys.
Crazy rough, really overcrowded.
There's assaults and murders on inmates monthly.
He's an American, accused of murdering a Mexican citizen.
The government is well within their rights to keep him there.
Well, they could do worse.
They could lock him up and throw away the key.
Look, the only thing we know Reid is guilty of is getting the vials for his mother.
Now maybe the drugs in those vials weren't illegal.
I hate to say it, but they probably were.
I mean, he couldn't get whatever it is stateside.
Or let's say it wasn't an illegal substance, but whoever planted the heroin in the trunk...
Put something crazy in the vials as well.
Right.
Reid is going to El Diablo maximum security by the end of the day They just put in the transfer.
This is Prentiss.
I'll be right there.
Mom, don't do that!
Don't do that!

Leave me alone!

Stop!

Oh!

Ohh!

For God's sake, leave me alone!
Mom!

Why did you do that?
I hate that stuff and I hate you!
Do you have any idea what I went through to get that medicine?
It can't be replaced.

Good!

- This is home.

I want to go back to where I was before.
Uhh!
Reid?
A little good news.
Backup is here.
Hey, Spencer.
Hey.
Thank you for coming.
Yeah, of course.
Jack and me are finishing up a case in Costa Rica, so we hopped on a commercial plane to get here.
We're trying to stop your transfer to El Diablo.
Do you think it's possible?
Yes.

Some of what was in there hasn't been approved by the FDA, but there aren't any illegal substances.
That's great news.
Is there anything else you remember about your time here?
I remember what happened to the vials at home.
My mom threw most of them out.
So that's why you were here, to get more.
It must be.
Well, you're off the hook for that.
There was no contraband involved.
Yeah, but we were still looking at the planted drug and murder charges, which could keep you here for a long time.
So what can we do to delay the transfer?
You said that you met Nadie, who calls herself Rosa, in Houston.
Why didn't she just give you the vials in the U.S.?
I don't know.

But she helped us and I trusted her.
I was right to.

Well, she convinced you to cross the border multiple times.
She had you risk your life.
Because she must have had something to lose, too.
Like family.
We need to know more about her.
Well, what was in those vials?
Yeah.
There are some nootropic compounds like Ampalex, uh, but also some more natural stuff...
Coral calcium, Jimson weed, coconut oil, a variety of vitamins...

Where are we right now?
Matamoros, Northern Mexico.
Jimson weed, otherwise known as the Devil's snare, originated in Mexico, but its natural growing region is further north or south of the border.
Now, that sounds like you.
So it isn't from here.
Then where'd she get it?
Garcia, we've got some questions.
Hey, Penelope.
Oh, my God.

Are you there to save the day?
I'm trying.

Knowing we have you guys as backup is providing me some much needed hope, and I work better this way.
Clara:

Shoot it at me.
Where is Nadie Ramos from?
Mm, she lives with her family just north of Matamoros.
That must be where she got the Jimson weed.
What's weird is she crosses the border like a lot.
Why?
Well, she works at that clinic in Houston.
She also helps at a local healthcare center.
I can't find a visa on her, which is double weird.
And in finishing the weird trifecta, there's a social security number on her W-2 form.
Social security?

Yeah.

She was born in Houston, and her family had to move back to Mexico.
She lives with them and she works in the U.S.
Well, this changes everything and we need to talk to the consulate.
It's time for his transfer.
We've had a break in the case.
The victim was also American, and that calls for extradition.
I've got orders.

With the victim having dual citizenship, we now have concurrent jurisdiction.
It was my understanding that the official order to extradite SSA Spencer Reid would be evaluated.
I understand.

They're taking it to their brass.

Let's go.
Hey, stop!
We just got word that he's under our jurisdiction.
We'll be taking him back to the U.S. Ok?
Ok, thanks.
My old unit chief at BAP has a call in to the best legal counsel the Bureau has to offer.
We need a dream team.
That's what we'll get.
Cruz said we need Reid's work history, performance reviews, commendations, and reprimands if there are any, and we need them in the next 3 minutes.
Garcia and I compiled the list just in case.
Done.

All right.

We're working on all channels here.
Matt Cruz is on with the consulate right now.
We could get an immediate extradition, but it's just the beginning.
I really screwed up and I'm so sorry.
It was for the right reason.
I don't know what happened, but I know I didn't kill anyone.
We do, too.
Hey.

Effective immediately.
You'll forgive me for feeling like justice isn't exactly being served with this move.
I understand.
But I can assure you this has gone to the highest ranks and there will be a full investigation.
Thank you for working with us.
For our reports, I would like to have the recording of that cognitive interview.
I didn't record it.
But that was our agreement.
I determined he was still under the influence.
Anything he said wouldn't have clarified matters.
You're committed agents.
And I've worked with the IRT before.
I trust you know what you're doing.
We do.

Thanks for the ride home.
Don't mention it.
Commercial airlines kick my ass nowadays.

Once you've had the best, it's hard to go back.
I was just thanking Clara for helping us.
Yeah, and I told her, when one of us is in trouble, we all are.
You guys have any other problems with this, we happen to know some people.
Love that.
I can't thank you enough.
Hey, it's all good, man.
I'm just glad you sound like yourself again.
Me, too.
Ok, so here's the deal that Cruz made.
We can stop by the BAU when we land, but then we'll drive you into the district and take you to the federal jail.
Since you are under investigation for murder, these cuffs are going to have to stay on until you are arraigned, but you're not a flight risk up here.
Thank you.
Circulation's a wonderful thing.
And the moment there's a chance for outside witnesses, these go back on.
Have you talked to anyone about the legal team?
Yeah.

The BAP's a great group.

Mark my words, kid.

Prints and samples from the crime scene came back to our home lab.
They've found proof that backs up your cognitive.
There was a third person in that room.
You're not out of the woods, but I swear we won't lose you.
Hi.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
It's only because there are other people around.
It's ok.
We know you didn't do anything wrong.
But I should have told you guys I was going there.
I never... never imagined in a million years it would have turned out like this.
No one thought that this could have happened.
Look, you're not in this alone anymore.
Ok?

Deal.
My turn.
Come here, you.
Oh, my God.
Your color's better.
All I had to look at was that mug shot, and it had me really worried.
Yeah, we all were.
Glad you're back.
Me, too.
How's my mom doing?
She's fine.

I can't help it.
Trust me.

And that nurse you got is amazing...

Cassie, she's great.
I brought the boys by.

I bet she did.
Uh, I just got a text.
Reid isn't eligible for the Bureau's legal assistance.
What?
He was never briefed.
And he wasn't in Mexico on government business.
They won't represent him.
Oh, God.
We're on our own.
