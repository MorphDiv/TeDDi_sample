That's my favorite.
I have a feeling that these Whoopsies are going to be the best we've ever done.
I mean, there's nothing like watching videos of your coworkers eating shit and getting hurt.
Yo, Tel, dude.
Deadline for Whoopsie submission is 5:00.
See, Colleen gave me some extra birthday cake.
Took a couple of bites, threw it away.
I bet you Bill pulls it out and eats it, even though I cut my toenails over the trash can.
Hammertoe
See?
My God.
That's the big nail.
That's the big nail.
My God.
Whoopsies!
Totally, totally.
I'm fresh
You gotta, you gotta You gotta, gotta
Gotta be fresh
Hey, did you get these lights for the Whoopsies?
Well, apparently we had the all-time lowest sales numbers in TAC history last month.
Whoopsies!
Yeah, exactly.
So corporate has decided to bring in
"Best-selling author
"and world-renowned motivational speaker
"Bianca T mo."
So give it up or don't, I don't care, for Bianca.
Bianca?
Everything is about to change, in three...
Whoo!
Yeah!
All right!
Everybody get the fuck up!
Get the fuck up, yes!
Yes, go ahead.
Hug your neighbor?
Come on, hug it out.
Show them how much they mean to you.
You two, hug it out!
That's n.
She's like a motivational stripper.
It's just we have a pretty intense technical rehearsal we need to run for an awards show later.
You know what?
How long this takes, that is up to you.
Don't give a shit about telemarketing.
Don't care about your sales numbers.
Don't give a shit about corporate.
Lam here for you.
And you and you
I care about you.
All right, sit it.
Sit, sit.
I'm sitting 'cause I want to, not 'cause she told me.
Who here thinks this is a bunch of bullshit?
I think it's a ton of bullshit.
Hey, come here.
I barely bite.
All right.
I'm gonna ask you a question.
And then you tell me the truth, and I swear, I will walk out this door.
Okay.
Who's the author of your life?
Jesus Christ.
No, no.
I'm not religious.
I'm the author of my life.
That's a lie, and you fucking know it!
Okay, she says a lot of F words.
Who shapes your narrative?
Who steers your ship?
Captain Phillips.
Who is that?
She put me through hell.
Women are funny, no matter what Ders says.
Ghostbustersthe new one is the Ghostbusters to me.
Really?
But I thank him every day, because he make me the emotional fucking warrior that you see in front of you today.
I'm the author of my own life.
Choose happiness.
I choose kindness.
I choose positivity.
"I choose."
I choose.
I choose.
I choose!
Give her a fucking hand!
Come on, give her a hug!
Lift her up where she belongs!
Hoist that bitch up!
Wha!
Yeah!
I feel so free!
Right, okay, let's save some energy for the Whoopsies.
Guys, let her down.
Yeah, the Whoopsies.
No, I don't think we need that kind of negativity in the office, right, Bianca?
You are in control of your own life.
Yeah, I choose that the Whoopsies are canceled!
But, Alice, your red carpet gown, it's gorgeous.
Can I talk into your microphone?
Youjust did.
I put $30 down on the tux rental, non-refundable.
All right, so we just got to, like, deprogram Alice, remind her how much she loves the Whoopsies...
Except that I'm choosing not to do that because I'm choosing to be my own person and pattern my life after Bianca Toro.
Who here is ready to see the world in a whole new way?
Open up your eyes.
Why is he over there with you?
Shut the fuck up, Babak, okay?
I am here because if you would truly open yOLlf eyes, you would fucking see that I'm the co-fucking-motivator.
Can somebody fix me?
My mind is a tormented battlefield.
We're gonna get you there, my friend.
Adam, I love your spirit.
Why don't you go ahead and take that spirit and join the rest of your group?
Okay, the name of the game is musical chairs.
Mzisica, Jose.
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the ﬂoor
Let the bodies hit the ﬂoor...
Let the bodies hit the...
My gosh.
My gosh.
What happened here?
Now, there were enough chairs, but instead of saying,
.. Hey,
"how do we go after this
"as a, as a group?"
Y'all went, "Me, me, me, me, me!"
Yeah, like a bunch of bitches.
The lesson here is that when we face our problems, we do it as a team.
We're stronger whenever the flock flies together.
Let's hear it.
We're stronger whenever the flock flies together.
And back to me.
I'm flying in with another thought as a co-motivator.
Okay, think about it.
Sometimes, every once in a while, perhaps, a chair might break and there's not enough chairs for everyone.
What do you do?
Hit the music.
I will not hit the music.
I landed on my nut.
I belvedered my balls.
That hurts.
Okay, you know what, Adam?
Let's you and I, let's have a 20-second pow-wow over here, okay?
Now, I want to take you to the next level, okay?
Yup, level me up.
I want to tell you about something called "the clarity".
Now, this is the secret to everything.
I'd like you to take Bill outside, have a one-on-one session with him.
Sounds like something that I'd be interested in.
You do that, and I'll bestow on you the clarity.
Okay, my computer's on fire?
No, but our pants are because we lied.
Sowwy.
Look, I know you guys are upset because I canceled the Whoopsies, but listen to this...
"Sometimes the things that upset us the most
"are the things that teach us the most."
We just lied to you, our boss, and lured you into your office.
You should be calling us dildos and telling us to suck our dicks off our own butts or something.
That was the old me.
Alice, that was the real you.
Yes, I can, because it says so on page seven...
Okay, you know what?
Now there is no page seven, so you can't change.
Yums away.
Are you all right?
Paper cut, roof of mouth.
No,
I know that you're mad, and I get why.
Yeah?
Whoopsies.
It broke.
It's all broked.
You can't make me mad.
Lam the author.
Yeah?
Well, let's just see about that.
A Jose Canseco bat.
Tell me you didn't pay money for this.
Are you serious?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Yeah?
Whoopsies!
Whoopsies!
Whoopsies!
Whoopsies!
Boom!
Whoopsies.
What about this nice little crystal trophy?
How about we say "later" to that?
You gonna, you gonna, like, tell us,
"Go home now, no pay"?
This place is a prison.
Yeah.
It's a prison I built.
And it's a prison I'm gonna destroy!
I'm freeing us!
You know what?
I'm gonna tell corporate...
Because they've wanted to do it all along anyway.
We just want the fucking Whoopsies.
Don't you see?
We got to follow our passions.
We have to choose our paths.
No one chooses this.
Thank you, guys, for showing me the light.
We're free!
Are you ready to be a fucking author and change your life forever?
Can we talk about my relationship with my stepsister?
I feel like it might not be appropriate.
I see untapped potential.
But you know what else I see, Bill?
I see fear.
And it's time for you to take that fear and light it on fucking fire, Bill!
So we're glossing over the whole stepsister thing?
Bill, take off your shoes and socks.
I just started your fucking fear on fire, Bill.
Now...
Okay, Bill.
Just don't even think about it, all right?
Whoa, you're doing it.
I'm doing it!
My, I'm a fucking motivator.
I'm gonna try to have sex with my stepsister!
Thank you, Adam.
You're right.
I can do anything.
Shit!
I should have told you,
I have diabetic neuropathy in my feet.
I can't feel a thing down there.
But if it makes you feel better, the skin is bubbling off of my feet, too.
It doesn't make me feel better, Bill!
Kick it
Okay, next we are going to share PCOs, which stands for...
Primary Choice Objectives.
Give yourselves a massive fucking round of applause.
Yeah.
I know I was only gone for a short period of time, and I didn't hurt myself, so I'm ready for the clarity.
We'll get to that clarity a little later.
But right now, we're gonna share.
Who wants to roar?
Alice, I know you want to stand up and roar.
Come on.
I choose to shut the office down permanently.
Yeah, you guys, Bianca was right.
Think about it.
I mean, we have been stuck here for years.
Isn't it time for us to move on?
Yeah, and then we go to Dairy Queen.
Shut it down.
Shut it down.
Shut it down!
Shut your goshdarn mouths, please.
Okay, so you guys, what, are just fine with being unemployed?
They are fine with being the authors of their own lives, for choosing to follow their dreams.
I should be the CEO of a Lady Foot Locker by now.
That's foolish.
And I'm gonna tell my stepsister I love her and that she shouldn't marry Calista!
Do I need to remind you guys that this is TelAmeriCorp Rancho Cucamonga, where all dreams go to die?
Yeah, you buttheads are delusional.
You're looking at two big old bozos over here, all right?
Just pinched right into the bowl of TAC.
We don't have anything to our names.
I think maybe we got to roll it.
Well, you don't believe us?
Okay, you want to see it?
You want to see video evidence?
You keep looking at us like you want to see it.
Enjoy.
Adam's stuck in the vending machine.
Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and reach up there and pull your hand out.
Crap.
Now Blake's stuck in the vending machine.
That's...
And now I'm stuck in the vending machine.
Man, that was stupid.
The point is, Alice, you can't quit.
You can't shut this down, because we're not all winners with untapped potential, okay?
We're losers who are exactly where we're supposed to be.
Bottom of the shit pile.
Well, you know...
They might have a point.
I mean, I don't have a lot ofjob skills.
Stop it!
None of you are winning when you are celebrating humiliation!
Yeah.
Don't you see that?
You're all better than that.
I promise you, we're not, okay?
Just look around the room.
Would you hire one person from this room to work for you?
Well, I would absolutely hire one person from this room.
I choose Alice.
This is bullshit.
You would really hire me?
I thought there was something special about you the moment that I came leaping through that door.
I would be honored to work for you.
0h. my God!
So we're all gonna lose our jobs?
Adam, say something that motivates us.
I'm done motivating, okay, Bill?
I couldn't even read her book.
I can read.
Thank you for seeing something special in me.
To be perfectly honest,
I don't really see it in myself all the time, but you saw it, and you're a genius, so it must be real.
You're good at sales, and I'm a saleswoman.
No, you are so much more than a saleswoman.
You, you see into people's souls.
Yeah.
You think that because I made you think that.
All that profanity and the face-holding and chanting, I mean, those are just devices that I use to manufacture emotion.
No, but you said in your book that authenticity is the main ingredient to dreams.
I stole that from a teenager's lnstagram account.
No, but what about being the author of your life?
Well, I'm the author of a book that's made me very rich and very powerful.
Okay, look.
You can either come with me and be my assistant and find out what winning is all about, or you could stay here at TAC and be the queen of the Garbage Pail Kids.
What about you with your dad and me with my mom?
My dad is the nicest guy in the world.
Doesn't even drink.
I just told you what you needed to hear.
Don't be a sucker.
Whoopsie.
Boys are fresh
You gotta, gotta be fresh

Suck it!
Let's go ahead and watch her clip one more time.
You get your hands off me, motherfucker!
Come on.
What's your badge number, bitch?
I'm gonna take you down!
All right, everybody,
I just want to thank and dedicate this award to the one person who made this all possible for me.
Don't you dare play me off!
Nice.
Did you not win?
Did you lose?
Yeah, clap, motherfuckers!
How you like me now?
