♪ Right here in this moment ♪
♪ I just know it's meant to be ♪
♪ Tonight is so wide open ♪

Lights out.
What's wrong?
You worried about your university interview tomorrow?
It's SoCalArt.
They only accept, like, 40 people each year.
But hey, maybe I'll move to Cali to be near you and your sister.
Hashtag, goals, right?
While no fatalities have been reported, a number of students are being rushed to hospital, at least one in critical condition.
I'm turning it off.
Get dressed and come get breakfast.
Breakfast?
Okay.
Ha-ha.
So what you're saying is I shouldn't even have to take this test, right?
Frankie, I'd love to help, but...
What's funny?
Oh, uh, it's just something Grace said.
Well, can I see it?
Uh, not without a warrant.
Uh, I got your warrant right here.
Hey, what the hell, Frankie?
I thought we were joking around.
Yeah, no, it's fine.
Wanna head in?
Yeah, sure.
Hello, my name is Rasha Zuabi, and I'm reading for the role of Hero.
You're auditioning for the lead?
By all means.
"I was waiting for you when I heard about the crash.
We were supposed to grab dinner."
"But you never showed.
You were here, in this bed, three months and a day.
And every day, I've been here, talking to you.
But can you hear me?
Are you ever going to come back to me?"
We'll be in touch.
I can't wait for you to drive me everywhere.
California, here we come!
Can boys and girls be just friends?
The last time she was just friends with a boy, Tiny fell in love with her.
They don't count, okay?
Must have missed that chapter.
Jonah got a message from Grace, and when I tried to see it, he freaked.
Oh, my God.
Are they a good match?
Maya?
Up late practicing for SoCalArt?
Do you ever think about death?
As someone with a fatal genetic disease, yes, I do think about it.
Thanks for bringing it up.
I was up all night, and I saw a video of a girl our age getting hanged.
Because we're lucky we live here?
Um, so,
Jonah and I talked to student council the other day...
Hey, that creep just took a picture of us.
I'm trying to talk to you.
He just did it again.
Hey.
Creep.
Give it back.
You can't just take photos of people without...
Who are these people?
Douma.
Near Damascus.
What happened?
When they came, everyone was separated.
Men were shot.
Women and girls were taken.
People were dying all around me.
People keep dying around me, too.
I guess we're the lucky ones.
At least that's what everybody keeps telling me.
I was nervous at first, but then the words just flowed out of me.
That's amazing.
And the play is so beautiful.
It's about a girl named Hero, who has a boyfriend in a coma, and she's so worried that he'll never wake up.
But in the end, he does.
I'm pretty sure Hero is a boy.
In love with another boy?
They're gay.
Hero is based on Miles.
That's why he laughed.
Does this mean I can't get the part?
It was a long shot, anyway.
There are only three roles in the play and a lot of people wanted to be in it.
But why would he let me audition for the wrong role?
This is where I was supposed to meet my boyfriend, but he never showed up.
What happened to him?
He, um...
Then my bandmate got in this texting-and-driving accident.
Then there was the bus crash.
When I went to visit Tristan in the hospital... all I could think was that... he was there... because I exist.
How did he look after the crash?
He was...
Hold your hair back.
Relax your hand.
Hey.
Um, would you be able to hack into Jonah's messages for me?
Well, by court order, I have to say no.
But... if he's ever used our Wi-Fi at home, I have his password.
I installed a key logger at home when Mom was e-mailing my doctors.
Can I have it?
Jonah's messages are private, though.
Yeah, Yael's right.
With great power comes great responsibility.
For not eating you when we were in the womb.
That earns you one password.
How would you feel if Jonah read through your private messages?
I'm just trying to make sure that he's not cheating on me, or lying, or totally in love with his best friend.
That's not how trust works.
Wait...
Have you read through my messages?
There's your password.
I trust Jonah.
Well, then you have nothing to worry about, right?
♪ If it's real and if it's right ♪
♪ Then we won't forget this night ♪
♪ When I'm ready to get close to you ♪
♪ I will, yes, I will, yes, I will ♪
♪ When the time is right I will let you know ♪
♪ How I feel ♪
♪ If this is real ♪
I can see that.
Junior orchestra, several bands, and quite a bit of songwriting.
But not since last April?
It... broke my wrists.
I've just been a bit blocked lately.
At SoCalArt, you'll be expected to write through the writer's block.
You're... you're very talented, Maya, but to be a great songwriter, you have to keep writing.
Hmm.
Immature?
Ready for your driving exam?
Oh!
Is there any way I can start again?
Is Hero based on you?
I guess so.
So you let me audition for a boy character?
I didn't escape the firing squads so I could be treated like an idiot.
Look, I was just trying to be nice.
You know what would have been nice?
Telling me so I could audition for the right role.
Okay, then do that.
The female lead.
We're doing another session today.
How am I supposed to learn a whole new set of lines by this afternoon?
Look, you said you didn't want to be treated differently.
You read his messages?
"Yeah, I knew I shouldn't, but I had to know,"
and then I was like, "Do you really want to know?"
So then I really, I almost...
I almost didn't.
But then I did.
And now I have to tell him, don't I?
Yeah, that'll go over well.
Well, how am I supposed to fix, you know, "immature"?
When boys say "immature," they mean one thing.
Are you actually considering it?
I don't know.
I've thought about it, but...
I can't really do that, can I?
Well, if you have to ask, the answer is probably no.
When Jonah and I are together... we just kinda fit.
And I haven't really felt that with anyone else.
But... when are you together?
Isn't he always busy with the play?
I just need to convince him to take a little break.
Hey.
Are these tickets to the Anti-Flag show?
I mean, they're more of a gift for me, but, um... you can tag along.
I never thought you liked anarchy so much, mayor's daughter.
I like different songs of... of theirs.
Frankie, I have play auditions tonight.
We'll talk later?
I wanted to be Hero
I feel his pain.
So why shouldn't you get a boy part?
Rasha, you ready?
Yes.
I'm ready to audition for the role of Hero.
Look, we talked about this.
But the feelings Hero has aren't exclusive to boys.
I haven't heard back from my best friend since I left Syria.
I'm not sure if she's okay, or hurt, or...
Shouldn't someone who deeply understands the material play the part?
All right.
You can audition again.
If you're right for it, we'll talk.
Fair.
This is him.
He looks peaceful.
I wanna look like that.
Ever since the crash...
I've felt numb.
And I thought if I just kept smiling, I'd feel better.
But I didn't... until I saw your photos.
They make me feel something and I just want to keep feeling.
That's why I need you to take more... with me.
Now.
We should do this before a nurse comes.
I got it done in Syria.
I just thought, you know,
Uh...
Hey, Rasha?
So, I was thinking about what you said.
That someone who understands the material should play Hero.
Did you have someone in mind?
Me.
Because no one understands what I'm going through better than me, right?
No, I suppose not.
But I really liked your audition.
So you're going to be Coma Boy.
And don't worry, it does have lines.
So, rehearsal's at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.
Who actually, um, approves the rehearsal times?
You okay?
I'm in the play.
I'm in the play.
Do you wanna... grab coffee?
That'd be nice.
You're better off without him, okay?
I mean, what was he thinking with those Xs?
Tic-tac-toe hasn't been cool since grade five.
Can I have a minute?
Frankie...
I have been under a lot of pressure trying to figure out my future.
And with the... the play, it's... it's a really big deal for college applications.
I understand.
But I feel really lucky to have you.
You're my rock.
Even though sometimes I can be... immature?
Frankie, I like you exactly the way you are.
Forgive me?
Good, then... what do you say we go get some ice cream for lunch?
Good. 'Cause you're driving.
Gotta practice if you're gonna pass your next test.
Can I meet you in your car?
Do you still have that condom?
Thank you.
That's... what I wanted to talk to you about.
You're off the hook.
What do you mean?
Me and Jonah are working on the play with Miles... instead of you?
Are we still cool?
If... if you want, we can find you another job on it.
Um...
It's okay.
I think I found something else anyway.
See you at school.
