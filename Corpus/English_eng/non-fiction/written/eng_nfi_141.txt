Stewart!

Stewart!

Didn't feel it.
Stewart's such a freakin' beast!
Lax season, baby.

Dude, I'm laser-focused.
If I can show Coach what I'm capable of,
I got a shot at varsity next year.
Oh, for sure.

I'm the fastest kid in the whole school.
All right, boys, listen up.
Great training camp.
Squad's looking real strong this year.
Stewart, your chest is bleeding.
No, it's not.
Yeah, it is.
No.
Okay, that's what I'm talking about!
Yeah.
As long as we keep raising banners, we're untouchable!
Lockwood Owls, baby!
You're the freakin' man, Pierce!
Okay.

Now, as a thank you for a kickass training camp, us seniors have a little present to keep all of you guys, uh, motivated.
Gentlemen check your phones.
Damn.

That picture comes to us from the legendary Robby Ragosa, who's playing D1 at Virginia, smokin' goals and smokin' girls.
Wait, why is there no face on mine?
There's no face on any of 'em, doof.
It's a freakin' sext.
Oh.
Look at that body.
And, oh, that tattoo.
It's like a... it's like a freakin'...
Unicorn.
Mr. Pemberton.
Where-where am I...?
Damn, Alba, how many cars
- can one person crash?

- not my fault this time.

- That guy parked like a maniac.

- and now they're mine.

They're kind of...

- They're ours.

They're ours, and I want you to be
- more careful with our cars.

Well, I cannot help it.

- to the power of the machine.

- it's back to the minivan, okay?

- I mean, don't.

- I have no choice at this point.

I need you to sign this.
No.

It's freakin' bullcrap.

The lacrosse team was passing around some pic of some naked chick after practice.
Off to a creepy start.
Then Principal Gibbons just pops out of nowhere and busts me.

What's an honor board?
Why don't you ask her?

It's a committee of students and teachers that handle disciplinary matters.
Sounds like a committee of narcs and rats that handle snitching matters.
I'm not a rat, okay?

Uh-oh.

- Yeah.

Shut up.

Well, I know I got to go in front of the stupid honor board with Larry Flynt here.
This is not a joke.
I am not joking.

All right, if I rat out my teammates, they'll destroy me.
And if I don't, Principal Gibbons will just crap
- all over my future.

He's not gonna snitch.

Will you listen to yourself? "Just tell the truth."
Let me tell you a little story about a guy
I grew up with who just told the truth.
Brendan Carthas.

Cops offered him a deal.

Then he wound up a few days later in the back of a garbage truck, getting crushed until his guts shot out of his butt like a tube of toothpaste.
Oh, no, no, no.

- We go now.

- No, no, no.

- No!

Chip, listen to me, don't make this a thing, okay?
No, actually, don't listen to her.
I'll handle this, all right?
And what if you don't?
Then you shut your mouth and you do your time like a man, bitch.
Wrong with these people?
Okay, Benito, let's go.
Oh, be careful.

Excuse me!
- Did you not see me waiting?

Come on, Benito.
Mmm.
That is very nice.

You tried to trick me, but that is blueberry.
That is blueberry.

Mmm.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Not the Rolls.
Benito, did you see who did this?
Yep.
Tell me.

No way.

I don't want to be butt toothpaste.
Um...
Hello.

Principal Gibbons?
- Yes.

I am Mickey.

Chip Pemberton's aunt.
Oh.

- Oh.

Oh, and thank you for denting my hood.
Oh.

- It wasn't.

- What do you want?

- I came to talk to you about Chip.

He sucks.

And I'm pretty sure you get it, too.
But is this really a fair position to be putting him in?
How can I explain this to you?

And when these values swing askew, there are protocols in place to right the ship.
Okay.

But we do have values, and one of them is you don't snitch.
Look, it's not up to me.
We have an honor board for this very reason.
Yeah, I heard all about your little honor board.
And let me tell you about a guy I knew growing up who was also very honorable.
Brendan Carthas.

- so attractive.

- Well, I'm coming back around to the snitching thing.

- that I'm late for.

- many years to get him in the sack.

Hey, Chip, do you believe in God?
What?
Hey, Chip.
Hey, Sabrina.
- Got good news.

- Fixed your Gibbons problem.

Mm‚Äêhmm.

How is this good news?
Then everyone's gonna call me a traitor like you.
Chip, take the deal.
Hey, Chip!
Come over here, man.
Don't do it.
Later, traitor.
Hey, guys.

Take a seat, man.
So I heard Gibbons nabbed you yesterday.
Oh, yeah.

Uh, the picture was... insane.
Who's that girl?
Who knows, man?

Yeah, he is.

I like this kid, you know?

We got to get him a nickname, quick.
- Beaver Dog.

That is 100% it.

Um, yeah.

I love it.
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow night?
Want to come by The Pit?
The Pit?

Are eighth graders even allowed there?
You'll be with us.
Yeah, man.

We'll see you there, Beaver Dog.
You da man, B-Diddy.
I am the man.
Yo, grab our trays!
Yeah, yeah.

Mmm, would you like some delicious cake, Benito?
- Yes, please.

Not so fast.

Okay.
Mmm.
Delicious.
You must try this.

So good.

Mmm.
But Mickey said...
Mickey isn't here.
I am!
Me.
Your best friend.
So, what's it gonna be?
Oh, it's like that, huh?
Okay.
That is fine.
I didn't want it to come down like this, but you leave me no other choice.
Now tell me!

Who did it?

Wait!

Benito?

I need... my... inhaler.
Oh, no, no, no, okay, okay, okay, Benito, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Shh.
Oh.

No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is this what you want?
I can't... breathe.
What was that?

You-you can't breathe?
Oh, you help me, and I help you.
Talk!
Okay...

Good boy, Benito.
That's right, breathe.
Nice, nice.
Okay.
Tell me everything.
- It was a man.

He had hair... and a face... and he drove away... in a car.
That's it?
Can I have cake now?
Yes.
Enjoy your cake.
Hey, guys?
Pierce?
Anyone here?
Over here.
Hi, Chip.
I've been waiting for you.
I knew you'd come.
It's juice.
Gross.
Okay.
That... should... do it.
Okay... no.
Cool.
You gave it stripes.
What...
- Welcome home.

- Oh, I destroyed it.

Had a little chat with your friend Principal Gibbons.
He says that it's not up to him what happens to Chip.
He says it's up to you.
It is not up to me.
There's an entire honor board that decides.
Well, you better figure something out, because if you don't,
- I'm gonna have to go public with this.

It's a little machine, and you stick it into your computer.
Yeah, I know what it is.

Oh, it's your entire hard drive.
And I've got a feeling it's not all that honorable.
Oh.
Oh, I was right.
I want you to listen to me right now.
I own you.

Yeah...
You were just gonna snitch on me.
What?

That's called extortion, stupid.
Hey, guys.
Hi.
Hey, looking good.
Hey, man.
Beaver Dog has arrived.
What's the matter, Chippy?
Pine cone got your nuts?
Ooh, freakin' Geno Pinero!
Hey, what the hell are you doing here?
Lax guys invited me.
Chip, those guys are just covering their own asses.
They don't even like you.
I don't think they'd call me Beaver Dog if they didn't like me.
What?
Beaver Dog.

- No, it's not.

The guys gave it to me.
Chip, as easily as I can save you in this world,
I can destroy you.
And that is exactly what I will do if you don't go home right now.
Beaver Dog!
You've got to be kidding me.
'Sup, Sabrina.
You coming to the Brunswick game?
Tool.
Your sister needs a hug, man.
Yeah.
You guys sure it's okay I'm here?
Absolutely.

So if anybody messes with you, just, like, let us know, okay?
Okay.
I mean, Geno Pinero just kind of smoked me in the nuts with a pine cone.
Oh, with a dong like that, you'd think he'd be happier.
Yeah.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it, okay?
I'm thinking monkey business?
Done.
What's "monkey business?"
Just step back.
He's got to find it.
Yeah.
Ooh.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
- Get off me!

What the hell, man?
Don't hit that monkey.

- I-I didn't hit a monkey.

You didn't hit that monkey just now?
Chip, you see Geno hit that monkey just now?
- Uh, yeah

And you messed up, because that's Chip's monkey, okay?
- Monkey?

Does it look like I'm playing, Pinero?

Okay, okay, fine.

- For what?

- Hey, really, it's okay.

No, it's not okay, Chip.
Whose monkey are you sorry for hitting, Pinero?
- Chip's monkey.

I'm sorry for hitting Chip's monkey.
I'm sorry for hitting Chip's monkey, just get off of me.
You good, bro?
Yeah, I'm good.

You're lucky my boy's got a good heart.
Don't let me catch you beating up on monkeys ever again.
Now get out of here.
Lax for life?
Lax for life.
Come on, we have to feed him after this.
- He gets very hungry.

Nice work today.
It's been a big day for you, huh?
Hey.
- Buckle up, bitch.

- Same.

- Get away from my client.

Used to be Mom's suit, now it's my suit.
- Oh, your breath reeks of booze.

You gonna go tell on me, Donnie Brasco?
Get the hell out of here.
Ugh.
Hope you have a plan.
Yeah, I'll pop 'em in or something.
For the hearing!
Oh, yeah.

No, I was up all night watching prep school movies in preparation.
I got Scent of a Woman, Dead Poets Society, uh, Deep Blue Sea,
School Ties.

It's a good thing you're not a Jew, because that seems to be quite the deal-breaker in this world.
Did you say Deep Blue Sea?

Oh, yeah, yeah.

- No, no.

- Hey, you ready?

- You ready?

- Yeah?

- Huh?

- You ready for this?

Let's go stomp on those Jew-hating bastards.
Okay.
It's this way.
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Ugh.
This is even sicker than I thought.
There is some real evil
Illuminati-type vibes in here, right?
The hell are those?
My notes.
Oh, God.
We gather, as so many before us have,
- in the quest for truth.

No, that's... that's not... how it works, just... sit down, please.
As I was saying, we are here in search of the truth.
Now, is there a board member who feels compelled to begin...
Yes, there is.

Chip, would you categorize yourself as popular?
I'm on the lacrosse team, so, I'm popular.
- I like that.

Nope, nope, nope.
Yes.
The lacrosse team, and proud we are of all they do for our school.
Typically, there isn't much interaction between middle school and varsity players, though that isn't true in your case, is it?
I-I guess not.
Hmm.

I don't know.

- my speed.

Your speed.
Yes, I'm sure they're all enamored with your speed.
He is very fast.
Oh, please don't.
I know because I raced him once.
All right.
I√¢¬Ä¬êI did win, but that's... because I'm also very fast.
Chip... who sent you the photo?
Uh...
I don't know.
- Nobody.

Well, no, it wasn't mine.
Huh.

Obviously, it didn't appear...
Chip, it's come to my attention that you were recently given a nickname.
Would you please share said nickname with the board?
Beaver Dog.
Couldn't quite catch that, Chip.
- Beaver Dog.

- Yeah!

- Oh, sit down.

I've been around, you know.
There was a time
I could see and I have seen.
Brendan Carthas.
You want to ask him about snitching?
Oopsie, too bad.

'Cause he's dead.
Okay, can we please get to the point?
Oh, I'm just getting warmed up.
Now, I don't know if Chip's silence is right or wrong, but this is bigger than us.
This is about two words...

That Indian guy outside the bodega, pocketing ten bucks to get you a porno mag, he's gone.
He's long gone, and he's left us to spin inside this sticky web of technology and swiping.
Hey, don't swipe me, man.
What in God's name are you talking...
You think they wanted the sharks to get smarter?
It just happened... and they all got eaten because of it.
Are we gonna eat this boy?
Do you all want to eat this boy because someone gave him something?
I can do the math.

Uh... and Chip didn't ask to be it.
- Did you ask to be it?

You hear that?
"Nah."
And now you want him to sell out his unquenchable sexual appetite and his integrity?
I got news for you, friends.
Neither one are for sale.
This young man chooses honor.
He chooses life.
He chooses lust.
We are but food for worms, gentlemen.
Worms.
I think it's best we take a short recess, so we can all process what has been said here today.
It's a lot.

You're welcome.
Ugh, get away from me!
- What's wrong with you?

- What-What's me?

The picture from Robby Ragosa.

No, but you were...
You...
No, no, no!
As soon as everyone is seated
- we can begin the hearings again.

- Hey!

- Expel them both!

- Not me!

- It was Stewart.

I want them out of here!
- Screw you, dude.

I didn't do it!
Leave!
Now, you remember what I told you, Benito?
That minivans are for soccer moms and pedophiles.
No, the other thing.
That I can never tell anyone about this.
That's right.
I'm not a snitch.
I know... but I'm gonna need you to prove it.
Torch that son of a bitch.
Okay.
Okay.
Come on.

Good.
Good boy.
Whoa.

It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
You know, Benito, if anyone ever messes with you, like a teacher or a coach, then you can snitch, okay?
Okay.
Good boy.
I like fire.
I know you do, Benito.
I know you do.
What'd everybody do today?
Nothing.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Hey.
How'd your first game on varsity go?
How do you think it went?
Thanks to me, we had all our best players expelled.
Real weird energy in here today, huh?
