It's not supposed to be like this.

The man in that room is a prisoner of war.
What do you want from him?
I mean, if you've got a secret battle plan, I'd love to hear it.
God, if you didn't have your head so far up your ass, you'd see that we still want the same thing.
Except I don't approve of your methods.
Look, you may have faced Sidney, but we have suffered like he has.
Every one of us here was like him once.
And every one of you is saved.
He won't rise to your compassion.
I still think he can be some sort of asset, and I'll never find out how if you are in there screwing with him.
I really wish you would let me wear gloves.
Yeah, I bet you do.
I didn't scrub up.
No gloves means you'll be careful.
Ah!
How long has it been?
It's too late.
You can't change me.
What you've been doing doesn't help us.
Just keep stitching.

Be a shame if you choked to death
Oh, you were never really dead, but the sodium thiopental made it look close enough.
It's all about friends in the right places.
Still, the fact remains... we are dying and far too quickly.
Dr. Feelgood, bringing the party down.
'Cause you seem to be the exception.
Hmm?
From nearly the moment you arrived here, you were in solitary confinement.
Isolated from the world.
I nearly lost my fucking mind.
What I mean is... you are pure.
Neat.
Which gives us a unique opportunity to study why we're dying.
You saved me so I could be a guinea pig?
I'm looking for an associate... in fighting the inevitable.
So we all live long enough to make sure the... great Merge comes down.
Why think so small, hmm?
After the Merge, our kind will avoid extinction.
We'll be able to survive here, but wouldn't... wouldn't you rather live here?

Not all destined for the same place.
The knife that Aaron used on Patricia came from her kitchen... but it might as well have been this one here.
This one's tasted blood too, I imagine.
Aaron's?
I haven't seen him around for a while.
And my own.
I did that to steer you away.
I was trying to do you a favor.
Well, I thank you kindly.
Not that you'd never relied on fear, threatening some terrible retribution... fire, brimstone, eternal torment.
And then in front of God... and the people of Rome... you made me eat shit.
But I do see your point.
You and I... we are alike.
Let me show you how alike we've become.
I didn't say, "Cuff him."
He resisted.
But loyalty does still mean something to some people.
I asked Officer Tuttle here to act as your guardian angel.
Thanks.
Anytime.
How'd you know I came back?
Bob told me you didn't leave with your family.
I took that to mean you decided to stay and fight.
I've been looking through this.
I think my father was trying to split the town into people that he knew were taken and people he knew weren't, trying to figure out who he could still trust.
Sure... 30 years ago.
What good does that do you now?
I think he had the right idea.
Know your enemies, and your allies.
I say we figure out who in the town hasn't been taken, and we tell 'em what's going on.
We tell 'em to group up and that...
I'll come and help when they get changed.
They were at that town meeting.
They know something's going on.
I almost killed you.
It was me.
Don't matter how hard you fight, no one's that strong.
That's why we gotta help each other.
There he is, big as life.
The lock was all rusted up, so I had to cut it off with a saw.
You ready to do some shopping?
All right.
All right, now aside from the akms, the Beretta AR70s, and the Daewoos, over here I got your magnesium flares... stun grenades... and toe poppers still packed in the DOD Bubble Wrap.
This... isn't how we fight them.
Well, good luck and God bless us all, but me and Rosie, we're gonna dig in.
They come after us, they're gonna get a fight.
I need to protect what's mine.
Here you go.

Been here long?
Born here, been here, can't wait to leave here.
Where I've been living, with your tits and ass, you wouldn't have made it to lunchtime.
I'm looking for Kyle Barnes or the preacher he hangs around with, Anderson.
That doesn't mean you don't know.
When I got here, it was with everything we all knew... and I'm sure you came with even more.

I was wondering if there was a doctor out here with you.
You're sick?
I'm pregnant... and I haven't been feeling right... not like... when I had Holly.
When did this happen?
I mean, were you pregnant, um...
Come on, nobody goes to the hospital anymore anyway.
It's all, you know, home births in hot tubs.
Thank you.
What is it you want to know?
Oh, lots of things.
I wonder if I'll ever see my boy again.
If his mother still thinks I'm a narcissistic asshole.
But from you, Sidney... well, there's nothing more you can tell me.
So this was just... to see me bleed.
You know, most... men of religion who wear a hat do so out of respect for God.
But I see a black hat... well, that just means trouble.
Superstition and religion.
They're kissing cousins, you know.
They both require me.
My kind.
Instead of cutting me up... you should be bowing down.
Superstition didn't bloom into the word of God... till we got here.
Cutting me again won't change the truth.
Think about it.
Demonic possession.
Church got that one half right.
Talking in tongues, speaking for the dead.
That was all us.
And our arrival here was seen as diabolical.
Fuck off.
And then Christ arrived here, too.
Sent for us... to seek and save the lost.
John... given all you know now... what you've seen... anyone taken to be a messiah... could only have been one of us.
