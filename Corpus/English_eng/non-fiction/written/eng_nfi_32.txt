Thanks for cooking, Ma.
I haven't had a real home-cooked meal in... one day.
God, you're pretty.
Oh, you're lucky you're pretty, too.
Oh, I've missed nights like this.
Everybody I love under the same roof.
Well, my wife couldn't make it, so not everyone.
I knew what I was saying.
You guys got to come see what the girls did to Grandpa.
It's awesome.
I bet it's not as awesome as your mother's coffee.
I made that.
It's bitter.

We turned him into a princess.
He's all over my Instagram now.
You're about to break the Internet.
Good.

Princess Cranky, the grumpiest princess in all the land.
You're such a pushover when it comes to these kids, Joe.
Well, I can't say no to these sweet faces.
Ah, well, when you live with them, that wears off pretty quick.
Okay, guys, up to bed.
- Good night, Grandpa.

- Good night.

- Love you.

Ooh, this damn shoulder's barking at me again.
You got a couple of pain pills?
Did you check your purse?
Relax, Princess.

I worry about your dad.
He's been taking way too many pills lately.
Well, if they're mood enhancers, they've met their match.
What does his doctor say about all this?
Oh, he hasn't been to the doctor since...
Well, it was the morning after Obama first won.
His blood pressure shot through the roof.
Ma, that's almost ten years ago.
You got to get him to go.
I've tried, but he is so stuck in his ways.
About everything.
Bought him a cordless phone.
He still stands right next to the base.
Makes me furious.
Well, somebody should talk to him.
Any volunteers?
Fine, I'll do it.
- Oh, thank you, honey.

No, no, no.

Let's go upstairs and pretend like we don't know what's happening.

I learn something new from you every day.
Dad, you got to go to the doctor.
If you don't get a check-up, how will you know if something's wrong with you?
I'd rather not know.
Smile, smile, smile, dead.
That's how I want to punch my ticket.
Okay.
Okay, when did you ever smile?
He smiles at me all the time.
Yeah, see?

He's always on my side, right, Donny?
Ah, you got it, Pops.
He's not on your side, he's just a big yes man.
Everybody's a yes man when you're always right.
All right, all right, so let me get this straight.
You two jokers have decided you don't need doctors.
I got through the Vietnam War on aspirin and Bengay.
That's not true.
You weren't there.
You weren't there!
Adam, let me talk to you for a minute in the kitchen.
Come on.
What?
I just brought you in here so Dad could leave.
What?
Dad!
Thanks for letting me borrow your car.
All right, Mom and Dad'll be here any minute.
Dad's been avoiding me all week about going to the doctor, but I know he can't resist brunch.
That man would walk into a hail of bullets for a plate of bacon.
Yeah.

He's gonna float in here like a cartoon bear.
You guys might get along better if you stop nagging the old man.
Hey, I'd much rather be the fun son, like you, but someone has to step up and deal with things.
And that kind of attitude is why he doesn't invite you to go mall walking with us.
You guys go mall walking together?
Yeah.

I'd mail walk if someone asked me.
Three guys in matching sweat suits?
That's a boy band, Adam.
Honey, I'll go mall walking with you.
Not you.
- Hey.

Hey, Ma.
Where's Dad?
He won't come.

But Lowell was nice enough to give me a ride.
He told me if I ever needed anything,
I should call him.
I didn't think she'd really call.
Oh, she calls.
Oh.

It's like having a house boy.
Lowell, you do not want to start driving her around.
All right?

I can't tell her no; she's too nice.
Listen, when I first married Adam,
I got roped into driving her everywhere.
And the only way I got out of it was by going into labor with Kate in the middle of a yarn shop.
And before Andi, I used to drive her.
That's when I learned a little trick called
"pretending to fall asleep."
I got it from watching the possums on The Animal Channel.
Who wouldn't mind driving me to the outlets on Saturday?
I can't believe Dad wouldn't come.
He is so stubborn.
Oh, the both of you are stubborn.
Hey, don't say I'm like Dad.
You know I hate that.
I wasn't going to.
I was just going to look at Andi knowingly.
- Mm-hmm.

Okay, so nobody's gonna do anything?
- Mm-mm.

Fine.
I'll go over there and talk to Dad... who I'm nothing like... and be the bad guy like I always am.
Bacon's not my only weapon.
I got one more way to turn up the heat.
Good luck.

You should see how I sweat through my nightgown.
Ma, no.
Dad, I know you're home.

Hey.

I'm trying to get my dad to come out here.
Wait, you're the landlord.

Nah, I like him more than you.
You like him?
He calls you Mrs. Chiquita Banana.
Yeah, and I call him Colonel Sanders.
We have a thing, we're fun.
What's with all the yapping, Charo?
Dad, just get in the car.
I don't have to do what you say.
Fine, I can stand out here all day.
Eh, not on my front porch, you can't.
All right, you old drumstick,
- get your Kentucky Fried butt in the car.

Okay, settle down.

You want to learn how to be a man?
Watch her.
Wow.
He got us both in one shot.

Mm.
Grandpa, please go to the doctor.
Yeah, Grandpa.
If you're gone, who's gonna ask me to pull their finger every morning?
Grandma?
No, that's a grandpa's job.
He's teetering.
Yep.

Please go to the doctor, Grandpa.
I love you so much.
Oh, kids, I can't say no to you.
So why don't you leave the room so I can say no to your dad.
Come on!
Everybody in this room goes to the doctor once a year.
Okay, it's what normal humans do.
What is your problem?
Look, I had this friend, Barney, from the VFW.
His wife was named Libby.
I always found that strange.
Libby.

Elibabeth?
Can I talk here?
Anyway, it had been a while, and Barney went in 'cause he had a cough.
When he came out of that doctor's office, his cough was gone.
Because he was dead.
Poor Elibabeth.
Now she's a wibow.
Don't do what he does.
Let's go, Donny.
I'm with you, Dad, just like on our mall walks that Adam is not invited to.
Yeah, did you know they go mall walking together?
I never should have said anything to Adam.
Now they're just in a big fight.
Bev, this is going nowhere.
Oh, they're throwing handfuls of snow at each other.
Oh, well, that's nice.

Here's what we'll do:

I can do annoying.
Hi, um, I'd like to make an appointment with Dr. Phillips, please.
What?
Oh.

No, that's okay.

- Okay, bye-bye.

Dr. Phillips retired five years ago.
But Adam said he sees him every year, which means someone's a liar.
Why would Dr. Phillips lie about his retirement?
Oh, that's right, you're Don's mom, too.
Listen, you can't make me do what I don't want to do.
So why don't you go back in the kitchen with the rest of the jibbedas.
What's a jibbeda?
You know, jibbeda, jibbeda, jibbeda.
Adam?
Look, I was thinking, maybe your dad would feel better if you told him how your last physical went.
Huh?

Uh, I don't know, I saw Dr. Phillips, like, six months ago.
Checked my heart, my blood pressure, gave me the one-handed juggle.
That's interesting because
Dr. Phillips retired five years ago.
Yeah.
I just called his office.

No, no, not busted.
I still go to his office, but I see a different doctor.
Oh, really?

Dr. Pepper.
Literally any other name would've worked.
Adam, why haven't you been going to the doctor?
Get him, Bev.
How can you say that to me and not Dad?
Because I live with him and he controls the thermostat.
God.
A person can only buy so many nightgowns.
Okay, look, last time I went, they wanted to run all these extra tests, and I had to sweat the results out for a week before they came back normal.
It scared the crap out of me.
So you lied and stopped going?
Hey, you have secrets, too, upstairs candy drawer.
That is not mine, that was here when we moved in.
Dad, you're a doctor-hater, back me up on this.
Adam, you are being a moron for ignoring your health.
What?

From you?

Well, this is different.
You have young kids, a beautiful wife.
You have a reason to live.
I heard that one, Joe.
God, you're pretty.
Very funny.
The point is, we all want you to go.
Okay, okay, I'll go.
But on one condition:
You're going, too.
So you won't go unless I go?
That's right.
Just like when you potty-trained him.
Fine.
Ha-ha!
You're going, too, Don.
These gowns are ridiculous.
Well, at least your gown fits.
I'm flapping in the breeze down here.
That's because they don't have the Jolly Green Giant size.
Speaking of that... ♪ Ho, ho, ho ♪
Legs together.
You know, we could be home watching the game right now, but, no, you had to go and make a big stink about this.
Hey, I'm just trying to be a good son.
I mean, look at this one.
He keeps licking tongue depressors and putting them back.
I got to be better than him.
Well, all I know is I've had enough already.
And no way in hell you're getting me through that door.
Good morning, gentlemen.
I'm Dr. Knox.
I'll be doing your check-ups today.
So, who's up first?
That'd me be.
Let's get this party started.
- Here we go.

Well, it's a good thing I threw on some pants, 'cause I really thought this house was empty.
Oh.

I just wanted to be here when the boys came home from the doctor.
And Lowell was nice enough to give me another ride.
We got up so early, we already stopped at the farmer's market.
We helped the farmers set up.
I found a potato that looks like Elvis.
- Oh.

I did.

I don't know why.
You know, Bev,
Lowell has a family and-and responsibilities.
He-he can't keep giving you rides everywhere.
Oh.
I'm so sorry, dear.
I just wasn't thinking.
You don't have to take me to the outlets.
Oh, Andi, you can take me.
No.

What just happened?
- I'm free.

Get back here!

No chance, sister.

- You...

- Out of my way!

Hey, boys, did you get a clean bill of health?
Yeah, yeah, we're all good.
But this lucky guy won himself a date with a colonoscopy.
These prep instructions read like a war movie, and my rear end's Omaha Beach.
This is all your fault.
Hey, I was just looking out for you.
Well, I don't need it.

Because you are my business.
You know, I took the day off of work to make sure you stay healthy and live a long time.
Jibbeda, jibbeda, jibbeda.
And you wonder why I'd rather hang out with your brother?
Wow.
You know, I haven't been a dad as long as you, but I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to say that.
Oh.
You and your new rules.
In the old days, you could hurt anybody's feelings.
Okay, I can't even talk to him anymore.
- Well, I can't talk to you either!

Joe, I think you're overreacting.
Yeah, I mean, they do these colonoscopy things all the time.
You know, they scare you with the thought of aliens probing your butt, but it's your own people you have to worry about.
Aw, Oreos and milk?
That's your sad snack.
I'm not even pulling them apart
- and having fun with them.

You know,
I'm just trying to help my dad.
Would it kill him to say "thank you"?
Oh, honey, I think it might.
Yeah.
I'm not asking for much, just a little,
"Adam, I see that you look out for me and I appreciate that, because your older brother is a narcoleptic ape."
Look, he appreciates you.
He's just not the kind of guy that lets it out, but it's in there, deep, deep down in there.
Maybe they'll find it during the probe.
Look, hon, it's always been this way with you guys.
He doesn't like to talk about feelings, you don't like to talk about feelings.
You're both incredibly stubborn.
In fact, you could say that the both of you are almost exact...
Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't say it.
We agreed many years ago you can't say that.
I mean, what if I were to say that you and your mother are...
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Let's just put the pins back in these grenades and walk away.
So your dad's colonoscopy went very well.
Oh, good.

I have seen that man eat his whole life, and I just want to say I'm very sorry for what you had to go through today.
Uh, just to warn you, he's probably going to be a little loopy from the anesthesia.
He might say some things he wouldn't normally say.
What, like what he's really feeling?
If he's feeling it, you'll hear it.
Sometimes it's beautiful.
Most of the time, it's creepy.
Hey, Dr. Foxy.
Dad, it's Dr. Knox.
That's what I said, Dr. Knockers.
So how you feeling?
Jazzy, like a jazz man.
Okay.
Okay.

You know, when they were putting me under,
I got worried I'd never wake up.
And then I'd never see the people I love again.
Your mother, your brother, Andi... those kids...
Yeah, and?
Tony.
Tony?
Yeah, Tony.

I love that guy.
Ah, I just need a signature on these release papers.
Oh, he's just getting dressed;

Uh, actually, these are for you.

- He did?

He's the only one I trust."
He actually said that?
B-Before the drugs?
Yeah.
Well... on to the next butt.
Ah.
Hey, Dad.
What are you grinning at?
Nothing.
Come on, everyone's home, waiting to see you.
I just had a damn movie camera up my ass.
I'm moving as fast as I can.
Well, if we time it right, we can finish our mall walk right when Cinnabon opens.
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?
Just heading down to the mall for a walk.
Are you guys going to the mall, too?
That's lucky.
No, no, no, no, no, this is our thing.
Your thing is fighting, our thing is friends.
I'm going.

And you know what I have in my pocket?
Three gift cards for Cinnabon.
All right, let him in.
And you know what I have in my other pocket?
Another gift card for suck it.
Hey, Dad, wait up!
Yeah, Bev, we want you to be able to get around without depending on, well, me.
Um, and we found a solution.
It's a driving service called Uber.
Uber?
Sounds German.

No, it's an app on your phone.
You press a button and a nice driver comes to you.
How do they know where I am?
I don't want the damn Germans knowing where we are!
World War Three breaks out, I'm on the list!
He's right.
And something's coming.
Things have been too good for too long.
Okay, look, there's not gonna be... you don't have... look, even if that happens,
I'm pretty sure you're way down on the list.
On the list is on the list.
I am nothing like him.
- Of course not.

- Mm...

Oh, jibbeda, jibbeda, jibbeda.
