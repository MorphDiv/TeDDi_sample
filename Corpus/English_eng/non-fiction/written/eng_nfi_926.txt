Probationary WPC 515G Tennison, attached to B Relief Hackney, sir.
- You worried they'll eat her alive?

No.
And what brings you to the police?
I thought the force could do with more posh sorts, sir.
I'm very sorry to tell you that a girl we believe to be your daughter has been found dead.
We are treating it as a murder enquiry.
- When did you last see her?

Who would want Julie-Ann dead, Eddie?

- Did you see her get into a car?

- What sort of red car, Eddie?

Eddie Phillips has absconded.
I want all units out there looking for him now.
♪ Call out the instigator
♪ Because there's something in the air
♪ We've got to get together sooner or later

They said you'd be here.
Sir, I don't think Eddie Phillips was just Julie-Ann's boyfriend.
What?
I went to speak to Suzy and she...
Tennison, you shouldn't have done that.
- There are protocols.

Whatever she said could be inadmissible.
When was this?
- Just...

- Same again.

- What are you having?

I'll just have the same as you.
There you go.
- Cheers.

Eight years ago, we had this young PC --
Charlie Hopkins.
He was not much older than you.
He died while doing a routine check on a vehicle with false plates.
The driver deliberately mowed him down.
What Hopkins didn't know was that... .. the driver was on his way to an armed raid on a bookies.
I got information about a garage that had taken the vehicle in for repairs, so I broke in.
I found it.
Smashed headlight... .. dented bumper... blood smear.
I knew I had him.
- The driver.

No.
No, he saw me go in the garage.
And by the time I came back with the warrant, he'd torched the car.
No fingerprints, no nothing to connect it to PC Hopkins.
Bastard got away with it.
Sorry.

I didn't mean to be... .. going on about that.
- Cheers.

Same as you, I trained at Hendon.
And when was that?
Late '50s?
Early '60s?
Really?
Well, I suppose that explains why you're walking me home, then.
Clearly, I'm old and doddery enough to warrant a chaperone.
Actually, it's because you nearly fell over coming out of the pub and then you tried to get your car keys out.
I didn't want to see what happened next.
Well, in that case, erm... .. thank you for saving my life.
No, seriously, erm...
I'm very...
Drunk?
Grateful.
I admire you.
No.
Sorry, I can't be doing that.
I'm your superior officer and er... we're both very drunk.
Evening.
Er...

Erm... will you be OK getting home?
Yes, I'll be fine.
Er... well, erm...
All right, early bird?
Morning.
Late one, was it?

Er... nowhere.
Stayed in.
Up late studying, that's all.
Tell me we've found Eddie Phillips.
Still looking but we'll find him.
Sir, nothing found in Eddie's flat.
- Not one print that matches Julie-Ann's.

Any luck tracing the red Jag that Eddie claimed picked Julie-Ann up?
- That was the last time she was seen alive.

Can you get started on those red Jag phone calls, Jane?
- Jane?

- Phone calls?

- Where did you get up to?

Go from there.
Morgan.
I need a plonk to accompany me to Julie-Ann's parents.
Er...

Sorry.
Tennison?
There was a matching necklace.
It was part of a set.
I'm sorry.

At least we'll have something of hers for the service.
We'll release the body as soon as we can.
There is another reason that we stopped by.
What is it?
We've already told you everything we know.
This may be difficult for you to hear.
Julie-Ann may have been trying to kick her drug habit because she was pregnant.
Oh, dear God.
I take it neither of you knew?
The newspaper describes Julie-Ann as a drug user and a prostitute.
If you speak to the press, will you remind them that she was more than that?
Of course.
The post-mortem also revealed that your daughter had injuries consistent with a beating we think from about two weeks before her death.
W-W-Was this the boyfriend?
This... er...

How do you know about Eddie?
The newspaper describes him as Julie-Ann's boyfriend.
"Helping with your enquiries."
♪ Wish everybody would leave me alone, yeah
'The news is on the hour every hour.
'And there's no better way to listen to your favourites than on the nation's favourite.'
Come on, John.
Time to get up.
They've been talking about that poor murdered girl again on the radio.
Ta.
Makes you scared to leave your own home.
Is David back?
He was.

He spoken to you?
About?
Just wondered what he's up to.
John?
Is this about some girl he was seeing?
He's fine, Ma.
Here, do us some bacon, will you?
♪ All those lies can be so unkind
♪ They can make you feel like you're losing your mind
You got anything stronger?
Do I look like a dealer?
Please, man.
Tell me where I can find Eddie, then.
You're not gonna find him.
If you really need something,
I can give you an address not far from here.
We're speaking to all Jaguar dealers in the area, looking for the owner of a red XJ series.
20,000 red Jags sold since 1968.
- Can we get a better description?

- Tennison?

I just found Julie-Ann's PM report lying on my desk.
Yes.

Yes, but it needs to be in an envelope with my name on it.
It's sensitive material.
This vehicle was parked at Homerton Hospital.
- 'Are you still there?

Sorry, you said he worked there?
And that's definitely a red Jaguar?
Erm... this garage serviced a red XJ6 for a doctor at Homerton Hospital.
So that's Dr Hussein Pryor.
Thank you.

- Morgan, you beauty.

Silas, darling, is that van gonna be parked there all day?
Once they've unloaded it, I'll get them to move it round the corner, OK?
And the noise level?

Let's hope not.

You're a treasure, darling.
Hey.
You have to keep quiet.
The busybody next door will complain and the council will shut me down.
Please, move this stuff downstairs.
What do you care if the council shut you down?
Yeah, this time next week, you'll be on a beach.
Sitting on a big pile of cash!
- Ready to roll?

What are you gonna do with your share?
Get as far away from here as possible.
Me too.
- Mum will be all right, won't she?

She'll have Dad to look after her.
Yeah.
Oi.
I don't know what's going on in that head of yours,
- but don't fuck this one up for us, David.

She looks familiar.
Julie-Ann Collins.
She came here as an outpatient on May 1st to sign up to your methadone programme.
She was last seen climbing into a red Jaguar outside here.
Do you own a red Jaguar XJ6?
My wife has the Jag.

She lives in Kent.
We're gonna have to contact your wife to confirm this.
Fine.

- Who's Teresa?

One of the receptionists.

- Is Teresa here now?

They'll have her details.
Thank you for coming in, Miss O'Duncie.
After I had my appendix out last month, the stitches got infected.
Just take a seat.
I had this shooting pain right across my stomach.
So they put me on a course of antibiotics...
O'Duncie?

C-I-E.
Well, when I came back to work today and heard about Julie-Ann, the pain came back, in the same place, right here, so maybe it's an emotional pain, not an infection.
- Every cloud...

Dr Pryor said you let Julie-Ann use an office phone.
Her and Eddie.

He was always around.

- Any idea who she called?

I overheard her asking someone for money.

But it was an 01 number.
- Would anyone have written it down?

External calls have to go through the switchboard.
You still have it?
When Julie-Ann left, did Eddie go with her?
He asked her where she was going.
But she told him to mind his own business.
He got really angry with her.

You should speak to him.
Hi, Sheila.
The public phone's always out of order, so I didn't think there would be a problem.
I like to help the poor angels any way I can, point them in the right direction.
That's where I wrote it down.

Before I got this job, I was an outpatient here.
It's a disease -- addiction.
Stop!
- What you doing?

Not by that ham-fisted method.
The forensic document examiner does that.
He's got a bigger pencil.
Come on.
What you doing here again?
I've been thinking...
I want the same share as John and Danny.
They're doing the manual labour.

You hardly even know Danny.
- He's your cousin.

David!
We're only keeping 40%.

The slices are already cut very thin.
Thinner for some than others.
Why has the money become an issue all of a sudden?
You can have 5% of mine.
Ten.
Don't push your luck!
Cliffy, mate.
Looked like you was having some family trouble.
A son like that needs to be brought in line.
Don't fill me with confidence seeing you being talked to by a cripple like that.
♪ I don't mind
Shit!
♪ Just what you say
♪ I never heard you, baby
We're looking for your mate Eddie.
I've not seen him since you last picked us up.
Well, he's your mate.

- No.

- I swear!

What did you put in your pocket as I came in?
Help us out or we take a look.
Try Dwayne Clarke.

This car was parked outside Homerton Hospital...
Hello?

We need to speak to this prick Billy told us about, Dwayne Clarke.
- He's hiding Eddie.

Nothing so far.

Well, run his name by Drugs and Vice.

He's getting fidgety.
He's rumbled.

- Hello, lads.

I didn't realise you Drug Squad boys got scared.
- My guv needs your help.

We need you to ID someone.
Dwayne Clarke, real name Darren Ackroyd.
Believe it or not, but the lad is well connected.
Fingers in lots of pies.
Dwayne's got form, likes to stomp on heads.
- Junkies, mostly.

You don't.

- Oh, come on, don't be a job's worth.

This is a murder investigation.

We think he's harbouring our prime suspect.
If you don't touch him, we'll agree to a fair exchange of information.
We'll show you ours if... well, you know.
We don't know for certain if there's active surveillance on him.
So make sure no-one outside this room knows.
Find Dwayne and we get Eddie.
And where do we find him?
Duke let slip that Dwayne has an alias:

We've got an address and a car registered to him.
Come in!
Sorry to interrupt.
Sir, the Forensic Document Examiner... erm... retrieved a partial number from the pad we found at the hospital.
0-1, 9-4-6, 0-3.
I'll need your signature so that the GPO can send us a list of possibilities.
I put it in an envelope... with your name on it, sir.
Leave it with me.
Argh!

Argh!
- Who's the cripple now, then?

You should watch your fucking mouth.
Arrgh!
Don't suppose Dwayne drives a brown mini?
Look, if he is as smart as Duke suggests, then he's not gonna come back to his flat with Eddie, is he?
Better not be late for my gig tonight.
Do you do any Beatles?
Bolan, Quo, Slade, Kinks.
No bloody Beatles, no.
You should do some Beatles.
- Dwayne's not home.

'Golf Hotel to DI Bradfield.
- 'Over.'

Uniform has spotted a blue Mercedes, listed owner Darren Ackroyd.
Registration:

Tell Uniforms to take him now.

That's him!
- 'Suspect apprehended.'

We're on our way.

- Where is he?

- Took four of us to pin him down.

- Yes, sir.

Get me out of here!

Dwayne?

- Can you hear me?

Knock once, if you can.
- You've got no right to do this.

Yeah.

Oi, what's this all about?
Get me out of here now!
You arseholes have got nothing on me!
Good work.
Eddie Phillips -- his girlfriend has turned up dead, he's done a runner.
And we think you know where he is.
So let's see what Mr Clarke's been up to.
A scuzzy dickhead like Dwayne Clarke can afford a motor like this, and I'm on a poxy scooter!
I don't know no Eddie.
We saw you with him, idiot.
So why are you covering for him?
I'm not covering for that arsehole.
We found these in the air filter.
It's enough to throw possession with intent to supply at him.
What do we find in your car that starts with W?
I didn't put that there.
Who did, then?

Here we go.
Got it.

So... in this little book we have a handy list of your customers.
Now, this Tod had quite the party on the 13th.
You supplied him with various drugs on the day that Julie-Ann died.
I've never seen that book before.
One of your coppers must have planted it.
You're on thin ice.
Same goes for that bag of weed and the money.

I'd like to speak to my solicitor.
Tell us where to find Eddie Phillips.
Fucking Eddie.
I ain't seen him.
How did you afford a place there, then?
I didn't.

Yeah?

Can't you type any quicker?
He didn't give us Eddie, did he?
We'll stick him with the possession charge.
What do you tell Duke?

You arrogant pricks.
All right.

Six months of surveillance down the drain.
We're building a case against some major players and you blew it out of the water!
I've got a murdered girl.

What's that?
Part of our fair exchange of information.
Duke, hold on.
Shit!
- Who's that with Eddie and Julie-Ann?

We're still establishing his identity, but he's a regular supplier of Eddie's.
They were taken two days before she died.
All we know is, on the street, he's known as Oz.
Thank you.
According to the plans, the first wall is...
.. somewhere.
It's there.
Right...

- Jesus.

'Eagle One to Eagle's Nest.'
We're done for the night.
'You still awake up there?

Eagle One, I'm awake.

Might I suggest we continue without her?
- Dad, where is she?

Oh, finally!
Sorry I'm late.
I hope you're not gonna wear that on the day.
It'll look like Pam's out on day release.
Please, Mum, I'm missing work for this.
Glad you could make it (!

- We're at the vows.

Take it, then!
And then when we leave the vestry, you hand it back to me.
Got that?
I think we need to go over it again for my sister's benefit.
- In a rush, Tennison?

First-aid training today.
I thought for a minute the rumours were right
- and you'd found yourself a new boyfriend.

The general consensus around the station is the only reason you've signed up is to procure yourself a husband.
Great.
You could do a lot worse.
Now, I've got you down to accompany DI Bradfield to the Collins Service.
So dump your boyfriend and smarten up!
- Sarge thinks I'm only here to find a husband.

Like I'm a cat stuck up a tree, waiting for a man to save me.
There is not a man in this station I would open my legs for.
What?

You're kidding?

Yeah.

- You got a boyfriend?

You?
Beating 'em off with a stick.
Look, I...
I don't usually drink that much.
What do I do if someone asks about the investigation?
Oh, erm...
Just tell them it's sub judice to discuss it.
George...
Oh, er... thank you for coming, Detective Inspector.
Have there been any developments?
We are chasing several leads, sir.
Oh, well, that's something.
So sad, George.

Erm...

Yeah.

Tennison, could you call a taxi for this gentleman?
Of course.
Thank you, dear.
Would you like to come and say hello to Mary?
Of course.
Hello?
48 Church Mount Road, please.
Oh... 0-1, 9-4-6, 0-3-6-5.
Thank you.
[0-1, 9-4-6, 0-3-6-5.]
Cheers, then.
Is er... everything all right?
I didn't see any ashtrays, so I assume Mrs Collins would prefer I did this out here.
Ah, yes, well, er... you assumed right!
- Sorry, sir.

I didn't think it was enough.
Well, it's enough to question him and get a warrant.
I trust we won't find your fingerprints all over those door handles?
I didn't touch it.
Where is Gibbs?
It was a good spot.
I don't usually drink that much.
That suspect driver I told you about...
About six weeks later, we arrested him for a different robbery.
And the bastard gets out this week.
What the hell's this?
Lords knows, I have no desire to delay your release, so I've convinced Mikey here to tell the warden he fell down the stairs.
So what?
Ought to tell your dog to be more careful who he bites.
Trust... that is so important to me, Clifford.
Now, I've invested too much in this job to allow anything to derail it.
Now, you promised me you could do it.
In return for 40%, I don't expect to have to deal with shite like this.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
Do you know who I am?
You're a nobody, old man.
You'll return the plans, and I'll find someone more obedient.
I was pulling schemes like this when you were still shitting in your nappies.
Now, my boys have already started.
So back off and let us get on with it.
All right.
Untwist your knickers, Clifford.
I've got people on the outside relying on you, so stop messing about and get it done.
Or next time, I'll take more than just your wife's purse.
Right, you four with me.
Where'd you go for that warrant?

Wait here.
With me.
All right?
Hi.
Make sure nobody goes into the bedrooms before I do.
One of the lads saw you and Bradfield outside the section house the other night.
I didn't think you were a cat stuck up a tree.
Be careful, Jane.
Nothing happened.
Weren't studying, were you?
Come on.
Excuse me.
- I'm so sorry.

DCI Bradfield?

- A change of shift?

Wh-Wh-Whatever's happened?
My officers need to search your house.
This is the warrant.
Now?
I already told you that Julie-Ann didn't live here.
You also told us you hadn't spoken to her since last year, but that's not the case.

The day she was seen leaving the clinic.
Er... well, what do I tell them?
That you need to be alone.
They'll understand.
George?
Excuse me, could I... have everyone's attention, please?
Thanks for coming.
All yours, Paul.
I'm looking for anything that can place Julie-Ann Collins here in the last two weeks.
- Morgan, can you sit with Mrs Collins, please?

Tennison, check the garage, see what you can find.
Sorry about this.
Wait there for me, please.

Well, why are they speaking to George?
It's just a formality.
Oh, my God.
Did you speak to Julie-Ann on May 1st?
She telephoned and we spoke, but not for long.
What did you talk about?
Er... she wanted to borrow some money.

- That was it.

No.
So on that same day, outside Homerton Hospital, we have an eyewitness who saw your daughter getting into a red Jaguar.
You have a red Jaguar parked in your garage, George.
On May 1st, at 11am, did you pick your daughter up from Homerton Hospital?
I don't even know where that is.
And about two weeks later, Sunday May 13th, in the evening, can you tell me where you were?
I've already told you.
Tell me again, George.
My wife and I went to a dinner hosted by one of the managers at my factory.
We found red fibres on Julie-Ann's socks.
Are they gonna match the carpeting in your car, George?
Why do you keep using my first name?
You think I'm guilty?
My own daughter.

After you picked her up from Homerton Hospital, where did you drive her?
Well?
We can place her near the car.
She left a nice clean thumb print on the passenger door handle.
Unless the father talks, it'd be hard for us to prove that was put there in the past two weeks.
Guv?

We found nothing in the master bedroom or the study.
- The spare room's used for storage.

It's this room, sir.
There's blood here and here.
The mattress had been turned over.
These fibres seem a good match.
I'll have to check with the lab to be certain.
Sir?
Christ.
They locked her in here.
This is a cell.
George?

- What's going on?
