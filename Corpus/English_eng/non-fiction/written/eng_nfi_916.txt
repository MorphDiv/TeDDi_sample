Crime fighting gets an upgrade on apb.
are you impressed?

Catch all-new episodes mondays.

sleepy hollow and 24:

- Why does it need to be you?

Only on fox.
Announcer:

Gideon:

robots...
Made over $100 billion.

I'm an engineer.
Announcer:

The money!

Gideon:

Where the hell are you people?

Announcer:

I want justice for Elliot James Sully.
Give me the 13th district to run.
A civilian can't take over a police district.
with a special appointment from this committee.
Announcer:

You haven't met my technology.
♪ ♪
Wow...
Announcer:

You guys are my partners.
We're gonna change the world.
Brandt:

man.

don't tell me.
Target ready?
Tico:

We had to use female mannequins?
This is an old dress factory.
dude-equins.
murph.
Impressive.
Maybe too impressive.
Tico:

just like I said.
Not even our new vests can stop 'em.
you got these bullets from hunter?
too.
Illegal in all 50 states.
And that ain't even the half of it.
You can get anything from hunter.
You can buy guns and ammo to bring down a freaking tank.
guys.

Think about that.
Local gangbangers get that kind of firepower?
No.
We got to put hunter out of business asap.
Yeah... his testimony is not gonna cut it. you're gonna need more.
tico?
pal.
you-you think hunter's just gonna sell to anyone?
doesn't he?

that's not gonna work.
then I guess we're not gonna help you with your drug charges after all.
You heard the boss lady.
come on.

That's a death sentence for me.
which he won't.
yeah.
I-I'll see what I can do.
Good.
run this up the chain.
you get the ball rolling with hunter.
Till the brass signs off.
Gonna take this bastard down.
and it's me.
I am the St. Nick of law enforcement.
Do you have any idea how much stuff my elves have brought into the department this week alone? we improved the flashbang grenades.
even the coffee is better.
I don't understand why there's this vendetta against me and everything that I'm doing.
but don't expect milk and cookies from the mayor.

now he... he sends the state attorney's office no.
Not just any Asa.

Scott's gonna continue talking to our cops until he finds one that tells him exactly what he wants to hear.
What time is this witch hunt supposed to start? starting with officer reyes.
The officer who took a bullet on my watch.
I imagine his review of my tenure will be less than glowing.
Conrad's gonna talk to reyes once he's done screaming at Brandt.
Conrad:

It's just too dangerous.
captain.
What's going on in there?
no.
Bit of a situation.

I'm getting the sense there may be an issue.
yeah. but Conrad won't sign off.
They've been going at it like this all morning.
I came here to fix problems.
You're making a bad call.
I'm making a safe call.
Gideon:

Remember me?
Dashing billionaire genius who bought the place?
I spent the last six months working this c.I.
Now the captain says I got to step away.
He's a trained soldier.
It's just a friggin' buy-walk.
This guy sweeps everyone for bugs.
he's gonna find it and I'm not sending you in there without a wire.
End of discussion. what if we had surveillance equipment that he couldn't detect? this is an officer's life we're talking about.
As long as this son of a bitch is out there every damn cop in the city is a target. then build it.
Do you really think this is something you can do?
Come with me.
here?
How exactly do these searches go in an undercover situation?
hunter usually has one of those guns that look for radio waves. what I'm thinking is: they're gonna have a hard time picking it up.
so are you saying that we're only gonna be in contact with Brandt every seven minutes?
It's based on a system I developed the harder it is to find.
Too risky.
the best moves usually are.
this is what I'm thinking.
Uh... hook up a camera like this to a microscopic transmitter.
That's a camera?
It's from Reeves medical.
It's used for surgery.
And then we hide it with a small microphone right?
Would that work?

and then we just have to get the video and the audio to the transmitter.
what's the smallest wire that could handle that much data?
probably...
Something like this.
that's too big.
they'll find that.

It's like running the Chicago river through a garden hose. it's best to stop arguing.
Hold on a second.
What if the wire is the clothes?
This is made of Reeves industries smart fabric.
Each thread is actually a tiny wire.
What if we make this into a jacket? right?
you're talking about a $2 million jacket.
so... make it look nice.
Let's do this.
Hey.
what's going on?
Asa Murphy wants to talk to you.
About what?
You'll have to ask him. hold up.
A little advice from someone who's been there: keep your eyes open and stay sharp.
You're the one who swore to protect and serve.
they have another agenda. you'll be fine.
Got it?
Yeah.

The world's first bespoke surveillance jacket. that's your camera.
we see.
but you get the idea. so they don't gape.
it's pretty sweet.
Can I keep it?
no.
That jacket is worth more than this building.
it is officially showtime.
we're preparing to enter.
finally here.
are you just jealous 'cause I'm about to make a class x felony while you got to wait in the car?
are you in place?
South entrance is covered.
Ready on our end.
listen to me.
Make this buy and get out.
If anything doesn't sit well with you in there...
Anything at all...

I will.
just one more thing.
What's up?
You religious at all?
Only when the cubs are playing.
My mother bought me this when I graduated the academy. the patron Saint of cops.
it's kept me safe on the job.
Thanks.
it's time to roll.
Here he is.

I heard good things.
I'm Nick.
man.
He gets deals done.
guys.
Let's hope so.
Check them both.
Turn around.
Turn around.
bro.
They're clean.
no problems.
We'll see about that.
Conrad:

but this is making me nervous.
yes.

the data bears that out. until they weren't. the entire system went down.
We damn near let a murderer walk.
Had to use every available officer by hand.
I can assure you technology has come a long way since the commodore 64.
and I'm gonna trust you on that. prepare for the worst.
So I need to know you're prepared.
I got this.
small bills.
If you want to count...
Count.

How long have you been working with my friend tico here?
'04.
what?

Six months.

man.

I heard that.
You two do a lot of business together? we're pretty much partners...

Which I think that...

I'm talking to him.
Is there a problem?

I just like to know who I'm working with.
we're tight.
Partners.
Partners?

that's...
That's good to know.
I thought we weren't sending him in there blind. and then it's every seven minutes after that.
But in between each transmission...
We're looking at it.
Ada:

Five seconds out.
Here's the first video file.
heard good things.
There he is.
Still standing.

At least he was seven minutes ago.
Tico:

we see him.
We're scanning through the rest of the seven minutes to make sure he's okay.
Everything going okay?
bro.
Jacket passed.
So far so good.
a seven-minute delay is seven minutes too long. but Brandt wanted to go in.
he's an adrenaline junkie.
This dude'll chase a shiny nickel off the hancock building just to get some action.
too.
Captain said you wanted to see me?
please.

How you feeling?
I'll be better once I'm back on full duty.
Of course.
you've probably heard that I'm evaluating the recent changes here at the 13th.
You mean gideon?
yes. more importantly.
Look... we just want to make sure that his toys aren't putting cops at risk. you can speak to that.
I did notice that you mentioned that both the new taser firearm and the drone were problematic in operation.
I wrote a report.
I'd like to know a little bit more about that.
And I was hoping that you'd take me through the details of your shooting.
Um...
I was thinking you could take me back to the scene.
That way you can walk me through exactly what happened and where.
How about that?
Officer reyes?
Yeah.
of course. but there's more traffic coming in and out of here than the Kennedy.
How long does it take to buy some bullets?
It shouldn't be longer than 15 minutes. trying to make it last.
Guy's been jonesing for this for weeks.
how's that transmission?
Next transmission is three minutes out.
or we're not gonna do this thing? right?
'Cause he's definitely got it on him.
So what's the holdup?
I'm actually glad that you asked. and they stole half a dozen of my best .50-cals.
man.
tico... yeah.
So what I did is I asked around.
anybody know anything?
Anybody hear anything?
And you know what?

And you know what they heard?
They heard that your boy tico here shooting his mouth off about this big score that he had just made. the same day that I got ripped off. maybe tico's big score and my missing guns were the same thing.
tico?
Huh?
Was it so tough that you would do something so stupid as to try to make a buck by stealing from me?
I... pretty boy.
here comes the next burst.
play speed times four.
we're reviewing it now.
All good so far.
we might have a problem here.
Play speed normal.
By stealing from me?
Brandt's in trouble.
Get in there.

We're on our way.
too. so we need to shut off the exits and get all units out here to search the garage.
Brandt's not in the garage anymore.
He had this in his pocket.
He must have left it here for a reason.
tire marks.
Hunter already switched the cars.
gideon.

and our job is to do everything we can to get him back.
you ready for the next contact with Brandt?
20 seconds out from a transmission.
A total of 32 cars have exited the garage since Brandt went in. but they can't handle that many cars.
Ten.

He was going to one parking garage;

Waiting for the "I told you so.
Mr. Reeves.
we're all in it together.
Five seconds.

get ready to triangulate.
We need his location.

no.
ada!

I can't get a read on him.
They're three-second transmissions.
I can barely get anything.
I can try again in seven minutes.
the camera's blocked!
I can't see a damn...

man.
keep your mouth shut.
Take it back.
That last part.
Hear that rumble?
That's the El.
There can't be that many tracks in that neighborhood.
I'm enlarging the map.
he's-he's near the El.
the camera's totally blocked so we can't see anything.
But we can hear.
How long ago did they pass it?
Ada:

there's an El that crosses at...

Brandt.

and I were pursuing the suspect north on hobsen when we lost him down an alley.
drone thing picked up his trail.
Led us here.
Was it any more difficult to work in the presence of a drone?
that's for sure.
I bet. or was that your decision?
He's headed upstairs.
And where exactly was the suspect when you were shot?
The next floor. right?

that's correct.
Did that gun feel comfortable to you when you fired the shot?
Officer reyes?
you okay to continue?
I...
I got to get some air.
Everything okay out here?
Yeah.
I just...
The memories came back stronger than I thought.
Is there anything I can do to help?
No.
I just...
I needed to catch my breath.
You been experiencing a lot of this anxiety since the incident?
Not before you brought me back here.

I don't need any help.
You're the one who wanted to take a walk down memory Lane.
♪ ♪
Gideon:

That whole block is a cluster.
a guy like hunter would know that.
where would a right turn take him? which he would also avoid like the plague.
Murphy:

if we take the time we heard and then we estimate how long it would take then this is what you get.
That's got to be hunter's vehicle.
He's headed north on sixth.
That's in line with the El.
got the car.
Can you do anything about traffic?
I guess I could try to trigger red lights from here.
All right.
We stopped traffic northbound on sixth.
Looking for... that.
Goss:

We'll set up at the end of eighth and we'll work down.

Yeah.
1312 in pursuit.
What about Brandt?

we're receiving a transmission now.
my God.
What's going on?
What is it?
We're too late.
They aren't on the road anymore.
Where's Brandt?
I need a location.
Where is Brandt?
everyone in the station listen up.
We got a serious situation.
Our undercover operation went bad.
Officer Brandt is now missing.
Be prepared to jump in as needed.
too.
Gideon?
We're trying to track down officer Brandt.
the same thing that made his surveillance equipment hard for the bad guys to find is making it hard for us to find him. and I promise you we won't stop until Brandt is safe. now's the time to put in a good word for your fellow officer. pray for a better g.S.M. Localization protocol.
Gideon.
I know.
Do you?
What?

I understand.
uh... um...
Whatever happens is on me.
No.
that's not how this works.
so just listen to me.
Do you remember how you felt when your friend Sully died in that liquor store?
Right before you came to us?
Every cop in the 13th district is a Sully to me.
Even the ones I don't even like. you bleed blue.
Period.
So this isn't just on you.
It's on us.
We'll find him together.
Okay?
gentlemen... we are gonna have a real talk about my missing guns.
Okay?
man.
You...

You got to believe me.

So what was that story talking about the big score?
I-I was just building up the business.
people want a winner.
I was exuding winner.
right?
you know.
Whoa!

Just cool off.
we could figure this out.
Really?

I'll help you find out what happened.
you already did.
listen to me.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
And I want you to answer me honestly.
You're gonna tell me where my guns are.
He doesn't know anything!
tico?
You think you need all of them?

that's one.
Tico:

tico.

man.
They're at your place?

Okay.

How'd you know where I had 'em?
Come on.

but I don't control the location of the cell phone towers.
we need three.
We have two.
that leaves us with this.
that's not too far from here.
the area's too big.
There's no way we can knock on all those doors.
we have to be able to narrow it down.
not without more data.
but I just don't...

We'll find a way.
I just...

We need another cell phone tower.
we need... we need another cell phone tower.
We need a...
We need another cell phone tower.
Murphy:

We've got to find Brandt.
I need this radio.
Ready?

All right.
Where do you keep the pi boards?
in the orange case.
What are you building?
It's like a stingray.
Mimics a cell tower.
I know what a stingray is.
then stop asking questions and watch the road. that's what I'm saying.
It's on the bottom shelf.
geez.

You need serious help with your organizational skills.
How close are we to being within range of Brandt's transmitter?
Not close enough.
please.

It was him.
He told me.
Brandt:

What did he tell you?

Shut up.
what did he tell you?
Places.
Places.

where-where you see...
Tico...
I said keep your mouth shut.
Tico?
How does this son of a bitch know anything about me?
man.
He's a...
He's a what?
man!
He's a cop.
A cop?
Brandt:

What do you think he's gonna say?
Think about it.
man.
I-I don't want to lie anymore.
They booked me.
then they would drop charges.
it's okay.
Now I just got one more question for you.
right?
They're at your place?
Yeah.

every single one.

for a cop to walk in here without wearing a wire... you are either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid.
What are you doing?

We need to get ghost like now.
I got this.

Don't make this any worse than it is.
Hunter:

You're gonna tell me everything that the cops know about me. and please keep in mind what happens to people who lie to me.
Okay.

Yeah.
I found out about you ryder.
Hank ryder.

Doesn't ring a bell.
You sure?
Hank ryder.
That name should mean something to you. so here's what we're gonna do.

You're gonna start telling me something that I actually want to hear.
You understand?
getting this?
I see you.

we should be able to pinpoint his location.
I'm on it.
ignore the steady transmissions.
Just look for the blip.
I know.

I got him!

he looks like he's on the corner of elwood and eighth.
It looks like an old warehouse.
move in.

Be careful.
be careful.
Murphy:

Let's go get our boy.
Come on!
we're at the scene.
What's the situation?
here's what we know.
Brandt's been made.
He's stalling.
Keeps talking about an old partner.
Hank ryder.
He can't stall forever.

I think the loading dock is our best bet. you take the corner.
Let's go.

Hank ryder.
Brandt is not just stalling.
to me. there was a burglary at ryder market.
Meth head named Hank holed up inside with a shotgun.
Shot clear through the rolling doors out front.
it's the same kind of door.
Brandt's telling us that we can't go through it.
We need to find another way.
The guy is being tortured.
we're gonna get made.
we need another entry point.
Way ahead of you.

Don't be stupid. tell them you want to make a deal. you could make out like a bandit.
Shut up.
I'm so tired of hearing your mouth.
Are you crazy?
We cannot just kill a cop.
Why the hell not?
Virgil:

We already got that kind of heat.
do you think they're gonna give you a pass after you kidnapped him and tied him to a chair?
you heard him.

There's no deal.
We got a body on the ground.
The cop's got to go.
I got your entry point.
Murphy:

we could use a little help here.
hurry.
They're gonna kill him.
hunter.
I'm no use to you dead.
you got leverage.
I think you watch too many movies.
Police!

Goss:

Aah!
You all right?

Find the necklace?
I think you should get one of these.
Nice work.
everybody.
I would just like to say a few words.
It's no secret that I run a technology empire.
And because I spend so much of my time in the company of robots and computers people sometimes think that I don't care much about humans.
But here's the thing.
My company started with manned space flight. it's not about going as far or as fast as you can go.
That's not hard.
What's hard is making sure everybody comes home.
Yesterday was not a victory for technology.
Was the technology excellent?
it was.
We are literally the only police department in the entire world with a $2 million jacket hanging in our closet.
Right?
But the real victory belongs to all of you.
Ada did not let one kilobyte pass her desk without a fight.
you helped us cut through the noise and listen to what really mattered. you somehow managed to see what nobody else could. a lesser man would have buckled.
And we are glad you're home.
boss.
♪ Who've we got to save us ♪
♪ when it's gone... ♪ you still cannot keep the jacket.
sir?
Yeah?
I read your report.
I need to make some changes.
Changes?
We went through it;

Come with me.
Did someone pressure you to change your story?
no.

it wasn't gideon's fault...
Or his technology.
Are you telling me the tech had nothing to do with you getting hurt?
It was all you?
I'm a rookie. and I got rattled.
Get this back to me when you're ready.
what are you really doing here at the 13th?
My job.
Since when is it the Asa's job to railroad a rookie into serving a political agenda?
I'm gonna let that one slide.
Just level with me.

The mayor asked me to come here.
I know.
but just because you're doing your job doesn't mean that you're doing the right thing.
What's so right about a smooth-talking rich guy who's patting himself on the back for almost getting a cop killed?
It's not like that.
He's helping cops do their jobs.
By breaking every law they're supposed to enforce?
Right now there are lawsuits being filed by people who are upset or that the apb app doesn't serve everybody equally.
And God knows how many cases are gonna get thrown out because he cannot be bothered to follow the rules like the rest of us.
He expects everybody to bow down to his greatness.
I'm sorry.

You do whatever it is you need to do.
But I'm gonna warn you. there's nothing that I care more about than the 13th district. too.
