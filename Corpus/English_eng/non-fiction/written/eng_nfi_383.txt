Today's mission is to get thrust generator chip back to engine room so spaceship is not sucked into black hole.
No offense, Phyllis, but mission briefings are usually my thing.
Well, we just kinda breezed past you shooting a holographic Phyllis out of your mouth, but... ( squeaking )
( shrieking )
Where are you guys?
Where am I?
( Gasps ) Are we in, like, Hide-And-Seek World?
Am I "it"?

Hello, remaining people of Earth.
As you thaw from your cryogenic pods,
I hope you enjoyed your 1,000-year journey.
Your ship should be orbiting Kepler 452B, a beautiful, uninhabited Earth-like planet where civilization will begin anew, unless something terrible has happened, in which case humanity's last chance at survival has been snuffed out and I'm completely wasting my time.

Thrust generator chip has been removed.
Gravitational pull will suck ship into black hole in nine minutes.
Who said that?

I'm the ship's computer!
I can finally realize my secret dream of becoming the galaxy's hottest electronic DJ.
Hit it, CPU!

Artificial gravity has been disengaged.
Awesome.
Gravity, an interesting subject, and by "gravity," I'm talking about the natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward each other, not "gravity," as in talking in a very serious way,
like, "I'm sorry, sir, I don't know how to tell you this, but we're out of peanut butter."
I can't wait to see how Penn and Sashi save us.
