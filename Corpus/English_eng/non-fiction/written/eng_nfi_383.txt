[Sam] It's Sam.

[line beeps] [line ringing]
It's Sam.

[line beeps]
And then we hit 'em with the,
"What about your oppressive cops, bitches?"
Except without the misogyny, right?
You know, I really want to get at you, but I'm not sure how to do it in a respectful way, random hot feminist.
Guys, where's Sam?
They're probably... on their way.
We should just head in.
It's now or never.
- [dialing] - [line ringing] [narrator] Gabe Mitchell didn't always love being a white face in a mostly black part of an overwhelmingly white place.
What's up, hipster 8 Mile?
[narrator] He knew jokes about his race were essentially harmless.
All right, when I was a community organizer...
Ooh, check you out, Disney Channel Obama.
What did you organize?
[narrator] He checked his privilege and supported people of color.
You know, I could come with.
No, it's cool.

[narrator] He would never presume his voice was more important than those around him...
I can't believe Chad got that travel grant over me.
It's bullshit!

It wouldn't be America if mediocre white men weren't being rewarded over deserving women of color.
- [narrator] But...

...there was a tiny part of Gabe that wanted to scream.
You know what?
Sometimes people get what they have because they earned it.
Just because I happen to be a white male does not automatically mean I'm some asshole!
Fucking white people.
[all laugh] [narrator] Gabe didn't always love having to dodge the land mines of identity politics.
However...
Gabe loved after hours at the radio station, debating who made the best soul records and, of course, the great movies of all time.
In fact, when these two film majors got together, life was a Godard film in color, and the only thing that Gabe loved more than Godard... [line ringing] ...was Sam.

♪ Waitin' by the phone ♪ [knocking on door]
OMG.
Is it the Samantha White?
I know.

[sighs]
Should have been there.
I'm just dropping by to check your pulse, make sure you didn't die.
[grunts]
Is that ice cream?
Yeah, it's vanilla.

So what happened?

Reggie... he was a mess, and it just took longer than I thought.
- How did it go?

Apparently you need tickets to get in, and then Al yelled angry monologues from Training Day from the hallway until we got kicked out.
- I'm sorry.

The school's lacking in pep.
There's bound to be more rallies.
[sighs]
[rubs hands together quickly] [chuckles]
You know, it's just...

- So I'm gonna take a shower.

I won't be long.
I'll be here.
Hey, Reggie, I know you're going through a lot right now, but whatever you need, Sam and I are here for you.
[Reggie] Thanks, I actually, think I got what I needed.
Good.
Super cool.
Well, you know, our offer still stands.
Thanks.
Okay.

[Troy] Yes, let us start, everyone.
Start this meeting.
Thanks for being here.
[giggles]
[Sam] So I know last night's rally didn't go quite as planned, but with Reggie back in the fold,
I think we can all agree that something needs to be done.
Things need to change.
No guns for those rent-a-cops, and fire the asshole who went off on Reggie.
[Troy] Both CORE and the student government totally agree with you, Sam, which is why we, along with the administration, have put together a town hall.
- [clamoring]

- Yes.

[Troy] A town hall on the 22nd to facilitate an open dialogue on racial tensions at Winchester.
Do you feel the strings, or do they trick you into thinking you're a real boy?
[Rashid laughs] Pinocchio!
That was my favorite movie growing up.
What was the Kenyan version?

No, it was called
My Ancestors Were Smart Enough Not to Get Captured.
Sam, this is what someone who's trying to help looks like.
[Gabe] Help?
The administration wants a town hall just so they can pat themselves on the back for having a town hall.
We all know nothing's gonna change.
- Wait.

Sorry, have to.
We need to protest at the town hall.
Oh, I wanted to say it.
You were right last night.
♪ Rubbing ice all over their bodies ♪
[Sam] Thank God for the left nipple.
Thank God for the right nipple.
Thank God for the abs.
♪ Oh, rubbing on a nipple ♪
[Reggie] Our pain is why we're out in these streets.
Exactly, and I'm not talking a regular protest.
We need to shut shit down.
Well, maybe the system doesn't work because you refuse to use it.
Yeah, why do you have to make everyone your enemy?
- It's kind of her thing.

What are you talking about?
The more radical she is, the more acceptable you become.
[Sam] We are going to bring together every marginalized group on this campus and demand real justice.
#FuckYes.
I get the desire to protest, but the AASU supports the town hall.
- This is... this is...

- You just...

You tell 'em, Sorbet.
[Rashid] I'm going back to Kenya,
- and I mean it this time.

We're doing this.
Don't you wish to come in and have sexual intercourse?
Heavens, no.
I have a boyfriend.
I must go to him now.
Yes, you should.
On the other hand, sexual intercourse does sound good.
[chattering]
[Reggie] Now that Troy and his sycophants are gone, we can get to work.
All right, so we should probably split into groups.
[Sam] Oh, yeah.
Rashid and...
- Ikumi.

- Yeah.

[Sam] We're gonna put you two on signs.
May my art be your weapon.
I'm in.

I cannot do bubble letters, though, just FYI.
Al, we're gonna need you and the Black AF to take the lead on social media.
Also, we're gonna need water, bullhorns, snacks, and if you get anything gluten-free, I will smother you in your sleep.
On it and completely turned on.
[Sam] Reggie and I will handle prep and permits.
We've done it before.
And...
Oh!

Great.
- Great.

[Gabe] Okay, so do Sam and Reggie hang out on, like, a daily basis?
[Joelle] Gabe, you do know I don't know where Sam is every hour of the day.
Like, I'm not worried about Reggie and Sam.
Like, maybe for a second there, but not really.
I mean, I scoff at being worried.
Scoff.
Actually, I don't even think I know how to scoff.
I'm pretty sure it's not saying the word "scoff," though, right?
Am I talking a lot?

No, you don't seem worried or weird or like you're losing your mind.
- [scoffs] - [sighs]
I'm not this guy, though.
I'm sure everything's fine.
Wait.

Like what?

No, no, no, that was a "This white boy can't handle what I'm about to say" look.
It's true.

Let's just say, if I were you and Sam was...
Never mind.

No, no, you can't stop there.
If Sam was what?
The Asian Student Alliance would love to come out.
We have a screening of Bowling for Columbine that night,
- but we can definitely move it.

That's fantastic.

Wait.

What?

We can only get together and watch Rashomon and have conversations about the need for sword control?
Annie needs to calm the fuck down.
Well, at least she's still backing us after you low-key hate-crimed her.
- [clicks tongue] - [chuckles] Did I?
- No.

Hey, remember what you were saying earlier before about if you were me...
Fine, I just meant, if I felt like my relationship was slipping away...
Wait.

If I were you, I'd fight for my relationship.
Of course, that would require me to have a relationship.
Young Democrats agree that there's a problem, but we already committed to participating in the town hall.
But I wish we hadn't.
I'd have my group follow you anywhere.
- Nope.

Just all of it, Mehar.
Hey, what was wrong with that guy?
He seemed nice.

Not my type.
Well, what is your type?
- Maybe I know somebody.

Come on.

[sighs] Stop following me, crazy man.
The LGBTQIA Union would love to, but we have a screening of Bowling for Columbine that night.
Oh, we already talked to Annie, and they're canceling that, so... [woman] Actually, we have our own screening.
But it's nice to hear that Annie came to her senses and realized she shouldn't rip off other people's programming just to get back at me.
If you come across that bitch again, tell her it'd be a real shame if her boyfriend found out where she really goes when she says she's at the library.
Okay, so you're busy that night.
- We're gonna go.

I got, like, eight million questions.
Girl, so...

How Defamation would it be if Mehar were Annie's boyfriend?

Well, as long as we're on hypotheticals, who should be your boyfriend?
Stop fishing for my type, Gabe.
Come on, man.

[laughs] Okay, fine.
- He needs to be smart...

...nerdy, but kind of cool, a little bit of a badass.
- Okay.

Actually, black as hell and unapologetic about it.
Kind of serious, but okay when you make fun of him for it.
Able to carry a lot on his shoulders.
God, and those shoulders...
You got it bad for Reggie.
[gasps]
Joelle.
Why hasn't this happened yet?
Why do you think?
I have no idea.
Do you think Sam and Reggie are...
I don't know.
I never know anything with her.
As soon as I figure her out, she pulls back, and then I-I don't know all over again.
You know what I do know?
- She smiles with you.

Hey, that's a scoff...
But I'm serious.
I'm not talking a self-satisfied, "I was dope on the radio" smile or a "pissing Troy off is fun" smile.
No, with you, it's...
It's a whole-body thing, head to toe.
With you, she smiles from her socks.
Joelle, I called the cops the other night.
What?
[Reggie] Ooh, I'm sorry, massa.
[Addison] It's a song.

- What am I supposed to do?

I thought I was protecting everybody.
I thought it would keep things from getting too out of control.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
I didn't...

You absolutely cannot tell Sam.
But if I don't, I'm...
Never mention this again, because if she finds out...
She can't find out.
[Milo] I mean, I like to mix it up.
[Vanessa] More Malbec, Sam?
Or we can actually open the bottle you brought.
Never had wine product before.
And it's a screw top.

- Whatever's fine.

You guys have to listen to it.
It's, like, all these great stories of old Hollywood.
You Must Remember This...it's incredible.
[both] "Written, narrated, and produced by Karina Longworth.
That's me."
[both laugh]
Yes!
I keep telling my friends to listen to it, but none of them do.
I just heard the one about Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.
Oh, my God, they were the best.
Yeah, I mean, their movies...

Why do you hate love, Gabe?
When he got sick, she took five years off to care for him.
It's so romantic.
I love that story.

Sure, but Tracy was married the entire time.
What about his wife?
[Sam] Okay, things got messy, but...
So the woman who's getting cheated on, she's just supposed to make peace with it?
- Who wants some?

Well, it's good to know you condone affairs.
Anyone want some of Sam's wine?
No!

[Sam] Gabe.
Gabe!
If something's wrong, just tell me something's wrong.
Something's wrong.
- Okay.

Sometimes you want to spend all your time with me, and sometimes you pretend I don't exist.
- You're like a dude.

And not even a nice dude.

What?
I said, "You're right."
Well... well, now I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.
Things are...
There's just a lot of...
- It's complicated.

You're complicated as fuck.
[sighs] That's why I'm crazy about you.
You're a mess, but, like, in this put-together way.
I love that you use four-letter words and four-syllable words in the same sentence.
I love that you're kind of a snob, but you'll bring a bottle of wine that's only one step above Colt 45.
I love that you love Billy Wilder and Garry Marshall.
I love... you.
Fuck.
I love you.
- Gabe...

I love you, too.
[Gabe] So PDA is a yes?
- Mm-mm, it's a no...

- ...with exceptions.

[chuckles] Okay, my turn.
Mm-hmm.
You should know
I'll probably be saying "nigga" around you a lot because I'll find it funny you can't say it back.
[laughs] Okay, works for me.
[laughs] Good, because it wasn't a question.
- It was a warning.

Oh, I got a weird one.
Uh, I don't think we should do the whole, uh, Facebook...
- No.

I mean, you're in love.
You don't need "likes" anymore.
Yeah.

I do not want to see that fucking crying emoji.
Ah, yeah, fuck that guy.
- And his tears.

Like, we're in an exclusive relationship here.
It does not involve you, you sad bastard.
[chuckles]
You know, as long as we're honest with each other, who needs extra pressure?
And we're honest with each other.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Can our couple name be "Gam"?
[quietly] Gam...
Like an old-timey lady leg?
Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm in.

Yeah, 'cause then people will be like, "Oh, check out them Gam."
[laughs]
[chuckles softly]
Were you watching me sleep, nigga?
[both laughing]
You can't say it back.
[cell phone chimes]
Holy shit.
Uh, hey, maybe... maybe we should get some breakfast.
Lionel is so goddamn good.
He got the 911 audio from the night of the party proving that cop overreacted.
I'm...

Uh, Sam, uh, I think, uh, we should...
- Hold on, I got to hear it.

It's, like, already 8:00, you know?

[Gabe] Hi, yeah.

This party's a little out of control.

I'm really afraid someone's gonna get hurt.
That could be anybody.
[sighs] Okay, look,
I was gonna tell you as soon as things calmed down.
There's no way I could have known what was gonna happen to Reggie.
It's not like I called the cops thinking they were gonna come and pull a gun.
I didn't even know they carried guns.
[sighs] Wha...
Sam... please say something.
[grunts]
- [dialing] - [line ringing] [exhales]
It's Sam.

[line beeps]
Reggie... my comrade-in-arms, it was Gabe who dropped the dime to the pigs.
- [bottle shatters]

I never trusted that white devil no way, but now we don't have to feel guilty about your brown skin up against my browner skin.
[both grunt] [line ringing]
It's Sam.

[line beeps]
Sam, come on.
I've...

W-w-we need to talk.
Sam?
[sighs] Come on, Sam, give me a chance.
[shouting]
I don't know, but we need to figure out something.
Sam's your best friend.
[shouting continues] [overlapping chatter quiets]
Sam, can we, uh...
- Look, I-I-I can explain...

- What the fuck did you think would happen?

Do black people make you uncomfortable?
[woman] This isn't a good place for you.
That's not actually what the article was about.
- Guys, let's cut him some slack.

He didn't ask them to bring guns and go nuts.
Why are you even here right now?
For her.
I-I just wanted to stop the party from getting out of control.
[Reggie] Well, nice job.
Reggie, I am sorry.
[Gabe] Sam...
Sam, please.
