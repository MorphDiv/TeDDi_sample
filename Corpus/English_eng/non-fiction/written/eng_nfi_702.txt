Previously on Reign...
She knows.
Charles isn't at a monastery in Reims, is he?
The king of France has gone missing.
- What did you say your name was?

If you could convince Charles to return with us as king, then, we'd happily bring you along.
How dare you threaten my country or my reign.

I am a Protestant.
He's a heretic?

I know this isn't what you wanted, but for now, this marriage will protect you.
I can't stay here.
I feel a poison in my heart.
If you're looking for Lord Bothwell, you'll find him in that tavern.
I need you to give my brother James access to your port.
I don't give anyone anything.
I'm a businessman.
The Crown is willing to pay five percent of the trade profits.
Make it 25%.
That's more than fair.
Fine.
Do we have a deal?
Now that I think about it, no.
Keira, you love me for who I really am.
Another warning from the Loyal Watchman.
Every time he writes, he speaks the truth.
Don't bother trying to deny you're having an affair.
If I do marry you, it'll be for the good of Scotland and the promise of England and nothing more.
You're late.
You're lucky they aren't here yet.
I apologize.
Wouldn't want to miss greeting your Medici guests.
They are our Medici guests, and we must present a strong and united front for them.
- I'm here now.

Over the coming week, guests will be arriving from across the continent to witness our Catholic wedding, and few are as important as Lucrezia de Medici.
She lends legitimacy and strength both to my Scottish rule and our joint claims to the English throne.
And there it is... the one reason you're still keeping me around.
Yes.
Don't make me regret my decision.
In fact, if you have any other affairs or secrets to spring on me, you'd best get them out of the way now.
I know I made a mistake with Keira.
She's in the past.

There's my favorite hell-raiser!
Darnley, you handsome bastard.
- Hey.

He's an old friend.

You made it!
Should have known it would take a crown to nail you down.
Your Grace.
The Duchess of Florence and her family have arrived.
Lady Lucrezia, thank you so much for traveling such a great distance.
No distance is too great to honor the widow of our dear cousin,
Francis de Valois.
The queen was in a childless marriage before.
Are you certain the goods aren't damaged?
A barren wife is about as much use as soggy firewood.
Careful.

But to your point, it is said that Francis was a frail dwarf with undescended testicles.
How dare you!
- Duchess, I didn't, um...

If this is the behavior we're to be subjected to at this wedding, we will be taking our leave... immediately.
You have no idea what you've done.
And Francis was more of a man than you will ever be!
She's good.

Nicole has achieved practically overnight.
She has Charles regaining favor with the Catholic nobles.
Precisely as we directed her.
I welcome you here today to honor these three men for their valor and loyalty to their crown and country.
Lord Dechamps, you've been deemed worthy of the accolade of knighthood.
Did you sleep with her?
I didn't have to.

And it wasn't cheap.
Have you any news from your impetuous daughter, the queen of Spain?
Well, she's back in Spain, thank God.
But she's not happy.
I informed her Prince Henry's return to France has been delayed.
'Cause he is fighting Turks on behalf of the Catholic faith.
I thought that should please her.
Well, yes, she likes the slaughter of infidels, but she wants Henry on the throne, not his older brother.
Leeza will allow Charles to remain king while Henry's delayed.
And in the meantime, she's requesting that I attend Mary's wedding.
She insists that I represent both France and Spain's support of a Catholic union.
Meanwhile, back at home, every moment Charles remains Protestant, we run the risk of his conversion getting out.
Inciting civil war, which is why
Charles must give up this flight of fancy.
Especially with Henry on his way.
Oh, Nicole's power of persuasion better be all she promised.
Charles must reembrace
Catholicism and soon.
I was defending you against rumors of barrenness.
Is it not better that the blame be placed on Francis rather than you?
Defending me does us no good if it loses us our Medici support.
And attacks Francis, a man I loved
The Medici family has toiled for generations to rise from the merchant classes.

I will apologize to the duchess and...
Do you think an apology is going to fix this?
The duchess has already booked passage back to Florence.
Her ship leaves the day after next.
Then let her go.

If the duchess goes, she takes her support and the promise of funding with her.
All right, then we will find out what it takes to convince her to stay.
I've already taken care of that, she wants lands belonging to Lord Theodore Davies.
- Oh, that's it?

The Earldom of Menteith.
And only with this exchange is she willing to continue supporting my rule.
How can I help?
Try not to do anything else to embarrass me.
As queen, I need to handle this personally to expedite the negotiation.
Mary, we can't go on like this.
If I am to be your king, then I must be your partner too.
Partner?
You have lied to me, cheated on me, humiliated me... how exactly do you expect me to treat you?
I will marry you because I see no other option.
But that is the only reason.
Your Majesty.
What an unexpected and pleasant surprise.
Lord Bothwell.
You were also... unexpected.
Do you work for Lord Davies?
I... do not.
Then why are you mending his wall?
- You here to see him?

Let me help you out of your carriage.
What's your business with Lord Davies?
It concerns his estate.
And it is no business of yours.
- Where is he?

When will he return?
I suspect... never.
These are no longer Lord Davie" lands, they're mine.
I parlayed for them.

I'm actually quite good when someone isn't there to reveal my hand.
You won this property gambling?
No, I won it through my quick wit and a healthy dose of risk-taking.
So if you have something to say concerning this estate, you'll have to say it to me.
Why are we walking away from your house?
Taking long walks helps keep my mind clear when I negotiate.
Just name your price for the estate and I'll pay it.
I don't have time to negotiate with you.
Shouldn't you be preparing a wedding?
What's a simple land transfer to the queen of Scots?
This simple land transfer could save me from a public disaster that could cost us a critical alliance with Florence.
If you refuse to cooperate, then everything I have sacrificed to make this marriage happen will be for nothing.
So you're still determined to marry the Englishmen?
I am determined to rule my country.
And the sooner you sign over the deed to the duchess, the sooner I can go back to doing that.
And you can go back to... playing cards and swindling people in taverns.
As I recall, everyone in that tavern got what they wanted.
You're like a dog with a bone when it comes to protecting what's yours.
It's my best trait.
I'm the most loyal of friends, or the worst of enemies.
Your mother chose the former.
You worked closely with her?
I did.
And in honor of that,
I'll consider selling you these lands.
But having acquired them so recently,
I need to survey the area in order to assess the value of the estate.
And to do that will require a short boat ride.
Fortunately, my boat will only fit two.
You expect me to get in a boat
- with you, alone?

It makes no difference to me.
Fine.
I will go on this little boat trip with you.
But you better row fast, I have no more time to waste on this.
Or you.
We found him, Your Majesty.
John Hawkins, the man Spain is determined I imprison.
Your Majesty, I'm just a well-meaning privateer.
I've done nothing against you or England.
Perhaps not, but you've been accused of stealing Spanish treasure valued at
10,000 pounds while at sea in the new world.
That makes you a thief.

I prefer the term "explorer."
But officially my title is Captain Hawkins.
Give me one reason,
Captain Hawkins, why I shouldn't comply with Spain's request and throw you in the Tower?
My voyage to New Spain was not about theft, but about discovery.
If you'll allow me...
A fruit from the New World.
It's called a tomato.
This is a fruit?
Some say vegetable... standing argument.
Let me make my case to you that I am more than just a thief.

You've just earned yourself a dinner with the queen.
We'll see then if your discoveries are worth defying Spain.
Claude.
It's been weeks since our wedding.
I'm glad you're keeping count.
People are starting to notice that we are still living in separate quarters.
I understand that you needed some time, but you can't keep avoiding me forever.
We're talking now, aren't we?
Claude...
I am sorry for what happened, truly.
But now that Leith is gone... where does that leave us?
- We are wed...

I would give you heirs if you would let me have Leith.
But I cannot have him anymore.
Yet he still has your heart.
Claude, I am not pressing for heirs.
I'm simply here to remind you that I promised you a lifetime of happiness.
That is a promise I intend to honor.
It feels like everything's crumbling around me.
I'm worried about Charles, my mother has sent for Henry, which can only mean one thing.
With Charles's instability and his new religion, she believes he won't last on the throne.
Well, she sent for the next in line to replace him.
That's a good thing, isn't it?
Charles will finally be free of the pressures of being king.
You don't understand.
Even if Charles willingly abdicates, people will still say that he's the rightful king.
And the faction that supports Henry will never allow Charles to live, to be a threat.
Luc, this could not only be my brother's downfall, but his death.
A castle you can eat.
Painted food.
Isn't it extraordinary?
I see life at court suits you.
And not just the cake you had commissioned.
My family greatly benefited from your generosity after our last arrangement.
I was hoping I could make their lives more...

- I had a similar thought.

There's a lovely manor house, just outside of Meaux.
It would make a perfect home.
And how would I earn that?
Undo whatever it is you and your family did to turn Charles Protestant.
Convince him to come back to his Catholic faith.
Charles came to that decision on his own.
I don't know why or how.
There was no talk of faith or conversion?
My relationship with Charles earned me his ear.
But his conversion was something else.
He found a comfort and a peace in the simplicity of our lives.
Interesting.
Well, be that as it may, if you want to stay here, you will use every resource you have to convert him back.
Because if you don't,
Charles will lose more than just his religious freedom.
He will lose everything!
And where would that leave you?
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Best time of year to visit the region.
Although, the weather... can be a little unpredictable.
Where exactly are you taking me?
There's a good vantage point about a mile from here.
Don't worry, I'll have you back before the storm arrives.
I don't have time to play your games, Lord Bothwell.
Oh, this isn't a game.
Not while you and your rule are at stake.
Just wanted a moment of your time, away from the eyes and ears of court.
Well, you give me little choice.
What is it you wanted to say?
Darnley will be your undoing.
Lord Darnley will be my husband and your king.
Yeah, but should he be?
A man who deceives you in order to give himself an advantage, whose arrogance causes him to act without thinking, who speaks out of turn to you and those who you love.
How do you know all this?
Whispers travel like wildfire around here.
Especially those pertaining to you and your Lord Darnley.
There will be whispers no matter who I marry.
Darnley is not the asset you imagine him to be.
If you marry him, you'll spend the rest of your life trying to rectify the damage that he causes.
What you actually need is a partner, by your side.
This marriage will not be one of love.
But it will get me England and that alone makes Darnley worth the sacrifices, not the least of which is spending the afternoon trapped in a boat with a tavern gambler.
Flash flood.

Come on!
The boat is gone.
Brilliant.
Now we're stranded.
Being Catholic, I grew up thinking sex wasn't for pleasure.
But you... have taught me otherwise.
Charles?
Hmm?
Is that why you became Protestant?
- What?

I don't want to talk about this.
It's just... now that I've seen your life, here at court, I can't help but wonder, wouldn't it be easier, better even, if you were Catholic?
All these pleasures would still be at your disposal.
There's no use wondering about that.
I'm Protestant now.
But your most loyal and powerful subjects are not.
France is at peace now, but not that long ago,
Protestants... regular, kind people like my family and I... were being persecuted.
If they heard their king now shared their faith, war would break out and all their blood would be on your hands.
These aren't your words.
Has my mother been speaking to you, or has Narcisse?
Charles... they have a good point.
And they want to help.
If you would simply say you're Catholic, even if you're not at heart,
you could prevent all of that.
No.
I know you think you're helping me.
But I'm Protestant now.
Turning my back on that would mean relinquishing myself to the darkness that nearly destroyed me.
You of all people should understand that.
You know, that'll dry much faster if you remove it.
You are wearing a petticoat, aren't you?
I can't take it off;

Let me guess.
You'd rather soak there in misery than ask for my help.
Seems like it only takes one person.
I promised the duchess
I would get the deed to the estates to her by nightfall.
Once we dry off a bit,
I'll need your help getting back the fastest way possible.
There's no use to go back.
They can't get the deed tonight.
It's being kept by a merchant, at least a day's ride from here.
When I arrived this morning, you didn't show me around your lavish new home.
In fact, you seemed quite anxious to get me away from the estate and onto that boat.
Now I am asking you for your help in this urgent matter, and suddenly the deed is elsewhere?
These aren't really your lands, are they, Bothwell?
I needed some time alone with you to convince you to call off this disastrous marriage.
I should have known.
You are a liar and a scoundrel!
Mary, wait.
You knew what Darnley had done.
You knew I was coming to see Lord Davies and you were waiting for me!
You deceived me into wasting an entire day while my country suffers.
Is the future of Scotland a joke to you, Bothwell?
The future of Scotland is everything to me.
I was trying to protect you, Mary.
I am not yours to protect!
Yes, you are.
I promised your mother that I'd watch over you.
That when you return to Scotland,
I would defend you and your throne from any threat, and I've kept that promise.
I've kept you safe and aware of Darnley's true nature at every turn.
You've been watching over me?
And warning me about...
Darnley?

You're my Loyal Watchman.
Yes.
I am.
There are monstrous fish, scaled like a serpent, but with short legs, they can crawl onto dry land.
I've seen them with my own eyes.
And birds of every color.
Imagine parrots the size of ravens.
How marvelous.
I brought something back called a turkey.
Ugly bird, to be sure, but quite delicious.
Ah, yes.

They've deemed it unsafe.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Great Court of Elizabeth I, where fruit and land fowl strike fear into the hearts
- of men and queens.

I will not have you question the rules.
You will abide by them.
That's bloody boring.
Do you have something to add?
Yes.
That sounds bloody boring.
Leave us.
I can see how you incurred Spain's displeasure, Hawkins.
You could use a lesson in manners.
But I admit you do make for good company.
What's that?
Distilled wormwood.
Not so boring after all.
Did you just shush me?
I don't know.

Damn!

Ah!

We're out.

Oh, go and fetch your precious metals, and I'll change that.
They belong to the Crown now.
They belong to Spain.
- And they will be returned.

Spain simply took that gold from a land they'd happened to sail to first... it could just as easily have been yours.
- That and so much more, Your Majesty.

What really happened in New Spain between you and the Spanish?
We were forced to seek port in San Juan after a storm had battered our ships.
The Spaniards there agreed to allow us to make repairs in peace, but we soon learned that a Spaniard's word is worth dirt.
They attacked us.
I barely escaped with my life.
The others were not so lucky.
That's awful.
The gold they stole from Spain is nothing compared to what they did to us.
As you said, Spain has claimed the New World, and they won't let anyone else profit from it.
But why only them?

There's no reason that we can't do the same.
No reason England cannot rival Spain.
That's a grand idea, but it's not possible.
Spain is the most powerful nation in Europe, and England is small, surrounded by Catholic enemies.
I have enough to deal with here on this continent.
I can't afford to challenge Spain on another.
No, they will get their treasure back.
And what happens to me?
I'll make up some excuse about your release this time.
But if it happens again,
I'll have no choice but to imprison you.
Just as I was starting to think you shared my vision of an England whose greatness reaches beyond this continent.
The world is bigger than Europe, Your Majesty.
I wondered if you might have a moment, Your Majesty?
Does it require my signature?
It does not.
I only wish to discuss a matter of great importance to me.
Uh, perhaps we can go outside for a bit of archery.
It appears you can use some fresh air.
So they've gotten to you as well.
Who?
Lord Narcisse, your father, and my mother.
They've sent you to offer counsel on my health, my religious beliefs.
Actually, I came to ask for your counsel.
Your sister Claude, though we are wed, the truth is I don't know her at all.
I'd like to, but she doesn't make that easy.
I'm hardly one to give marriage advice.
No, perhaps not.

I-I want to learn what she enjoys.
Something we might share together.
She loves the stars.
When we were children, she used to gaze at them for hours, deep into the night.
She told me once that no matter what happened, no matter where we found ourselves, the stars would remain constant.
Always there to give us direction and comfort.
Does that help?
Very much.

Well, I'll let you get back to work.
Wait.

I do think I might like some fresh air.
Magnificent shot.
Francis was an excellent teacher.
Who taught you?

No.
He wasn't around much when I was learning archery or anything else.
Too busy giving advice here at court?
You mentioned that he and your mother had been pressuring you?
They think I've made a horrible mistake by becoming Protestant.
What is it about the Protestant teachings that appeals to you?
It isn't so much the teachings.
It's that, as a Protestant, I'm free to make choices without the Pope telling me what is right and wrong.
I'm free to rule on my own terms without all that...

And you don't believe that Protestant leaders will exert the same pressure once they learn you share their faith?
Protestant or Catholic, these are people.
People with self-serving interests, agendas, and demands.
I'm afraid you've simply exchanged one source of pressure for another.
How do I escape it?
Well, as king you will always feel pressure.
But you are not alone.
Lean on those who care for you and know your heart best... your family.
I promise, you will find strength and wisdom there.
Are you sure this is the way to Lord Davies' home?
You still don't trust me?
Nothing engenders trust more than a man who uses lies and misdirection to further his agenda.
My agenda is to keep you safe.
Despite my objections to your marriage,
I may need the duchess' support in order to protect your throne, so if you've promised her these lands,
I shall help you deliver them.
You have my word.
Why the Loyal Watchman?
Why not just sign your true name to your messages?
I made a lot of enemies working for Marie de Guise.
She was a Catholic, after all.
And when your mother died and James assumed the regency, well, he made sure to erase any trace of her Catholic regime.
I've been unwelcome at court ever since.
My brother was in a very difficult pos...
He's a political animal with very little regard for me.
And if I'd signed my name, he would have advised you to ignore my warnings completely.
I had to reach you another way.
Is something the matter, Bothwell?
Strange.

I felt like I knew you before you'd even arrived.
Hold, sir!

Mary.
Do you know him?
I've never seen him before.
I have a message for you before you wed.
Before I wed?
Not a step closer, sir.
No, let him finish.

You will have love or an heir, but not both.
If you choose a child, it will be a son, and he will rule both nations.
England and Scotland, united at last, and in peace.
This is your fate.
It is a choice, once made, that is immutable.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I never dreamed that the queen of Scots would be bringing me water.
I've instructed Lord Bothwell to get my guards to help get you back to court to see the physician.
How did you get here, Mr. Rizzio?
Please, call me David.
I'm a merchant from Turin.
Came with the prospect of business.
I had an accident on the road, and I was thrown by my horse.
I hit my head, and when I woke,
I was in the company of Druids.
The Druid who rescued me told me that he had an urgent message for Mary.
Not "the queen" or "Her Majesty," but...
Mary.
Like a friend would speak of you.
Did this man give you his name?
No, but I remember his face.
Dark hair, bright eyes, like sea glass.
He told me that he'd promised you something.
- A promise?

That he would come to you when you needed him the most.
Sebastian.
Did my friend tell you why he couldn't deliver this message himself?
He did.
Or at least his spirit did.
When I parted ways with the Druid, his spirit continued to guide me to ensure that I delivered those words to you.
I must confess, the journey is very muddled in my mind.
Why do you say "his spirit"?
Is he in peril?

I don't know.
Your Grace, the Spanish ambassador, Lord Renaude, is demanding an audience with you.
Why has John Hawkins not yet been arrested?
We received word he was brought to you, only to be released again.
King Philip will not allow the theft of Spanish treasure to go unpunished.
Of course not.
Hawkins has been reprimanded, and your gold recovered.
Spain will be repaid in full for her losses.
Reprimanded?

I understand.
He will be arrested and imprisoned at once.
Do not let this happen again.
Your navy is no match for our Spanish fleet.
And to the north, your Scottish cousin, already allied with France, marries with full Vatican support, with Catholic might surrounding you by land and sea, leaving England a diminished power.
A fact you would do well to remember,
Your Majesty.
My apologies to King Philip for this egregious mistake.
I'm afraid I haven't been seeing things clearly.
But I will rectify the matter.
Please tell me why you would give serious consideration to a prophecy spoken by a vagrant in the woods?
Rizzio is not a vagrant.
He is a merchant, and he is recovering in the infirmary.
And he wasn't speaking as himself.
I think he was giving me a message from Bash.
He joined the Druids to learn the gift of foresight.
And you've known others with this "gift"?
You believe in it?
I have seen what can happen if their words are ignored.
You mean what happened to Francis.
How do you know it's not a trick?
Staged by your Loyal Watchmen?
I know you don't have a high opinion of Lord Bothwell, but he made his intentions clear.
To warn me against Darnley.
He would have me believe that there is another future for me, one that doesn't include Darnley.
But if this prophecy is right, then my choice is clear.
Darnley can provide an heir who represents the future of both England and Scotland.
And that is more important than having love.
And what does this prophecy say about Darnley's inability to tell the truth?
It's one thing not to have love, but...
Mary, I learned something while you were away.
Darnley's lover,
Lady Keira, never left town.
She simply moved to a different inn.
And Darnley was seen leaving court earlier without an escort of royal guard.
No one knows where to, but...
He continues to see her.
I will marry Darnley, but I refuse to allow him to humiliate me in this way.
If this gets out, I will be the woman who couldn't keep her husband close on the eve of her wedding.
- I want Keira gone.

No, I want you to remove her yourself.
Throw her out into the street if you must.
But this ends now!
Stephan.
Charles, he's asked to speak with a Catholic...
- priest.

He's finally come back to his true faith.
You know, I had my doubts the girl could do it.
No.

As I hear it, it was all Luc, your son.
Luc?

But since Nicole has her hands on Charles, we best control her.
You can do that.
Make her fall for you.
I'm not sure bedding the lover of the king is a wise idea.
Charles is infatuated with Nicole.
He'll rely on her and she will seek to take advantage.
Isn't it better that you guide her ambition than it runs wild?
I will consider it.
- Good.

Then I'm ready to leave for Mary's wedding.
I'm here by order of the queen, Lady Keira.
I have a carriage waiting.
Please, I was told she's not to leave her room.
- She could...

Is that what Darnley paid you to prevent?
No, I don't know any Darnley.
God, no!
She's hurt!
I would've appreciated some warning before spending my night in a cell.
I had a meeting with the Spanish ambassador yesterday.
He insisted I arrest you.
So once again, you are bending to the will of Spain.
As far as I'm concerned, their request has been satisfied.
You're right, there is no reason
I can't rise to challenge Spain's power.
Except my own cowardice.
Catholic France across the Channel, Spanish power to the south, the looming threat of the Vatican,
Mary Stuart's Scotland.
My whole life I have been afraid of all of it.
I have been so focused on my own fear, but...
I've been looking in the wrong place.
Why not compare England to Spain?
Why not stretch our horizons beyond Europe?
Once one does, Europe looks... very small.
A royal charter.
For exploration and trade.
I designate you, John Hawkins, to navigate the New World.
To plant the English flag with the full support of the Crown.
Go.

I want to be the queen who makes England the greatest power the world has ever known.
It's just like being under the stars at night.
Yes, well, I'm afraid it was a little too cloudy for a real starlight picnic.
Aren't you clever.
I love it.
No matter what is happening, even if it feels like your world is crumbling, you can always count on the stars to be there.
Charles told me.
And...
I hope very much that one day you'll think of me in the same way.
I am your husband and I want to be there when you need me, Claude.
Thank you... for the stars.
And... for helping Charles.
Of course.

Now...
I can't believe I forgot the wine.
I'll be right back.
Charles.
Is everything all right?
Nothing will ever be all right.
I want to run.
Far away.
But I can't go outside.
The woods are dangerous.
I'll start again to ease the fear.
Soil and blood...
Charles.
I was well.
I want to stay well.
Duchess Lucrezia di Medici.
Duchess, I apologize for the delay in acquiring the Davies estate.
I hope my patience has paid off.
It will.

No need.
The estate now belongs to you,
Lady Lucrezia.
Queen Mary went to great lengths for it.
She's a queen who will sacrifice much for her allies.
Thank you, Your Grace.
I am pleased to be able to continue the alliance between Florence and Scotland.
How did you manage it?
Lord Davies responded well to your offer.
I simply sweetened the deal by giving him his choice of five of my favorite horses.
Might I say... we make good partners.
Thank you, Lord Bothwell.
Of course, Your Majesty.
Always a pleasure doing business with you.
You've welcomed him back into court.
He offered me help when I needed it.
Mary, I have bad news.
Keira was sick and weak with fever.
- I didn't know.

I didn't even know she'd stayed in town, but the physician told her to stay until she was fully recovered, which...
He said death will come this night, and it will be a mercy.
I am so sorry.
It was an accident, a horrible,
- tragic accident.

Your rage.
All because you don't trust me.
How can I trust you when you keep secrets from me?
Where were you going if not to see her?
It was supposed to be a surprise.
I went to a jeweler in Sterling.
Rubies arranged in a Tudor rose.
I thought you could wear them to our wedding as a symbol of my commitment to you.
Show the world what our union means.
All to earn your forgiveness, as your partner.
I had let go of Keira.
And I was reconciled, but... but not like this.
I will miss her until my dying day.
But what's worse is, every time I look at you, I will see the person who killed...
The woman you truly loved.
Tell me...
Mary... how do I not hate you?
Mary.
My dear child, what is it?
Catherine...
I don't want to to this.
Help me get out of this marriage.
