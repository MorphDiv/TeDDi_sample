It's over.

So, that's all.

I just need to be on my own, I think.
Can we just talk about this sensibly?
No, no.

I want you to come over and get all your things.
Can you come and do your thing here?
What?
We need you to do that people thing you do.
I really don't want to work for Dad, okay?
- What's in the box?

- I can't name your dog.

Ugh!

- Is the water over your head?

Sometimes it's right at my eyes.
I met up with an old colleague.
Are you writing?

What fields?

I don't think I'm living up to my full potential.
"The aim of this research proposal
"is to account for the observed rise in the number of deaths
"due to amniotic fluid embolism."
- Mum!

"The rarity of the disorder...
- ..is counterbalanced"by the increased...

- Um, yeah?

You're a good, patient girl.
Come on, let's read Peter Rabbit.
"He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice...
"soft sand on the floor of the rabbit hole,
"shut his eyes.
"His mother was so busy..."
Oh, sh...
Never mind.
How's the home stretch?
I've got to submit this tomorrow.
Oh.

I've wanted to do a funding submission like this for years, but now I'm scared it's not gonna be good enough.
Doing Martin's job, as well as my own,
I just don't have time or energy to do it properly.
So you're baking cookies.
Kim's doing this "Thank God you're home" thing for Martin and Cherie.
I burnt the first batch.

It's Bill.
Billie.
Yeah, maybe I will come over.
Yes!

- Was that you yawning?

Come over.

I'm gonna go, though.
- Have you eaten?

- I'll bring wine.

You can do this.
Finish the submission, be there for Billie.
Hang in there.
Martin will be back in less than 24 hours and everything will be back to normal.

- Billie, I-I know that losing Mick...

We broke up.
I know that letting Mick go was probably the hardest thing you've ever done.
I do understand that.
And I know there's really nothing I can do.
But I'm here.
- Please tell me what I can do.

I just have to go through it and not around it, not like with Dad.
I'm going to consciously grieve and let go.
I don't know what that means.
It means I've decided to get the advice of a professional mental healthcare practitioner.
I have a list of very impressive names and I've already scheduled times to audition them.
- Is 'audition' the right word?

I don't trust just anyone.
- No.

Um.

No.

Thanks.

Love you.
- You used to do that.

When you were about Paddy's age.
Darcy went away for a month and you'd sit at the door every night.
- Don't remember.

I don't remember cracking my head open either, but I've still got the scar.
Well, your hair grew back.
- Can hardly see it now.

Try not to shut down from each other, my darling.
I know you're hurting, but so is Zara.
- Hi, my little stinkys!

Hi!

The boys have been standing at the front door for the last hour.
- Mom, we saw three red cars.

- Alfie was upset.

Because he wanted to see you.
Well, I am here now.

- Frozen yoghurt.

Yes!

Hey, um, is it okay if I drop them half an hour early?
- I've just got an appointment and...

- I can't cancel without 24 hours...

Hey, have fun, all right?

Hey, what if we did a deal and I could make up the time on a...
Frozen yoghurt.

Why would we put him in a cage?
It's a crate and the man at the fancy dog store said it was the best one by a country mile.
It makes them feel secure.

It just seems so... cruel.
No, they love it.

I just...

- I do.

- Okay.

Oh, and I might stay over again tonight.
Oh, yes, please.
It's just easier with the group locked in this afternoon.
- Oh.

Can't wait.
Mom's gone.

What do you want to do?

Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Shit.

I'm sorry.

Dad's gotta go.

You wanna go for a drive?
You want to go for a drive?

- Have I got time to...

I've got eyes and ears on the ground.

They're on their way.
- Are we hiding?

Hurry up!
Was that Cherie?
- There you are!

Please don't ever leave me again!
Oh, we've all missed you, not just Kim.
Oh, I don't have enough big words to express how happy I am to be home.
Just the heat, and the dust, and blowies as big as your head.
I couldn't get home soon enough.
- Where's Martin?

Oh, he loved it, even more than I hated it.
I mean, the two of them tried to comfort shame me.
I mean, Ray would call me a sook every time I complained about the water pressure.
- Where's Martin?

Martin... is not coming back.
He asked me to give you this.
Said... get in touch with him any time if there's anything that's not clear.
Cherie, I am barely clinging to consciousness.
I think I'm on the verge of some kind of breakdown.
I have been limping for weeks in every conceivable way.
My life is not set up to operate at warp drive.
I've got too many balls in the air and not enough hands.
I've missed you.
I've missed you too.
But I don't think you're hearing me.
I need you to tell me when Martin is coming back.
If I knew, I'd tell you.

It's just a bit of power play.

He even asked me to post his special pen.
I mean, I don't even think he's got one.
I think he's making it up, so I have to go into his office and actively miss him.
Trust me.
I know you don't want to hear this right now...
Maybe don't say it, then.
We both know that's not an option.
Zara's a wonderful mother and she'll always have a place in this family.
- But you're my son...

Shut up.

I know things would be a lot easier if you could just take some time for yourself, but you can't.
You don't get to give up, sweetheart, not in front of the kids.
You have to find a grown-up way to deal with this, so the boys don't feel your frustration.
I know how hard that is, believe me.
In your mind, did you hide your frustration about Dad in front of us?
Because I feel like a lot of it came through.
If that's how you need to frame it, that's fine.
I can't control how you remember your childhood any more than you can control how your boys will remember theirs.
I don't think this is helping.
I know you want to throw your arms in the air and run screaming into the night, but it's not about what you want, sweetheart.
It's what the boys need.

Have a lollipop.
Aw.
And what type of training do you have?
I...
Well, I have a bachelor of medicine, a bachelor in surgery, both with honours.
I'm a fully certified psychiatrist, and I'm a lifetime board member of the Royal Australian and NewZealand College of Psychologists.
And I specialise in addiction and forensic psychiatry.
And are you aware that you're becoming slightly defensive?
No, I was not aware that you were perceiving me that way.
So, you don't think that you're being defensive?
No.
Unfortunately, that lack of self-awareness is a deal-breaker for me.
I think we'll leave it there.
Hello, you've called Nina.

Keep it together.

It's temporary.
You can keep going...

- Ready when you are.

Focus on one thing at a time.

Stay in the moment.
- Hello, little...

I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

- I'm sorry.

- We're both sorry.

This is not as wrong as it looks.
I... mean, yes, it is wrong, but not as wrong as it...
- I should have knocked.

No, please don't feel that you have to explain any...
Kim and Jess?
Yeah, they asked me to help out with the whole... fathering thing.
Oh, I thought they wanted Jimmy.
- Well, they've moved on from him.

Yeah, so, I was just...
- Oh, yeah.

- Well, congratulations.

- Oh, how was your trip?

- Yeah?

Oh, okay.

Hey, um, do you want to call him off?

Sorry.

Come on, mate.

- Okay.

It was good to see you and it was good to see Greg.
- Welcome home.

Right.

- Morning.

Just to let you know, he's in one of his moods.
So, he's conscious.
Well, for the record, I'm here for you, not for him.
I know.

- Come see me after?

Good luck.
You want to know what I think?
Well, I can't really do my job without some understanding.
It's all a crock of shit is what it is.
"Improve work practices." What's it mean?
It's just about creating a happier, more productive environment.
And why would people be happy?
It's called 'work' for a reason.

Well, that's fine for you to say in here with me, maybe just don't say it in the staff room.
The only reason you're here is your sister is getting on my tits.
Well, no one wants to see that, Dad.
Look, I'll stay out of your way as much as possible, but I will need your help.
I will need you to listen to what I say.
On the up side, you don't have to pretend to be happy about it.
Hm.
All right.
Okay.
Did Dad mention Pete Mulcahy?
No.

Right.
Pete Mulcahy walked into Dad's office last week and completely broke down.
- Broke down how?

- I mean, he was inconsolable.

Pete told Dad he was suffering from occupational stress and Dad told him to stop being a pussy.
Oh.

- I'm sorry.

- You're right, I'm not.

- Oh!

"Dear, Nina, I'm not getting on the plane.
"I can't get on the plane.
"Things have been so confusing between Cherie and me.
"We are only making love three times a week."
Only?
"You have nothing to fear but fear itself
"and Doctor Schumacher.
"He will eviscerate you if you fail to launch the end of month report."
What end of the month report?
"Which you will now need to complete by the 25th,
"as I do not anticipate returning before then.
"I hope you're enjoying your time as Acting Head of Obstetrics
"and not up to pussy's bow with the unachievable workload.
"As Winston Churchill might have said, 'We are all worms.'
"He's dead now.
"The point is don't be afraid to step into your power."
What if I'm not ready to step into my own power?
What if I can't?
No.

Okay, all right.

Okay.

When Mum gets home, you act like you were here the whole time, okay?
Good boy.

"Research into amniotic fluid embolism is important."
The proposal is strong.
Back yourself.
And if I get the research funding, then Martin will be back and I'll have the time.
It's gonna be great, Nina.
Now, call Billie back.
You've called Billie Proudman.
Your call is important.

Recently, I separated from my husband Mick.
I'm devastated, but the truth is I think I knew it was over some time ago and so did he.
I'm actually in quite a good place about that, surprisingly.
My concern is that I didn't grieve very well, at all, really, when my father passed away and I'm worried that I'm doing the same thing with Mick.
Did your father pass away recently?
Yes.

Were you close to your father?
Yes.

I'm here to deal with the grief that belongs to the end of my marriage.
Does your ex-husband remind you of your father at all?
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
Thanks so much for your time, Andrea.
Why aren't the capital expenses the same code?
It's not a liability.
Ugh.

Martin did not come back.
- What?

And now I'm elbow deep in this ridiculous report.
I can't even keep my eyes in the one column.
Well, that is just bullshit.
I know!
How was your dad?
Well, a bit like your report.
Were you calling to download and I got in there with a pre-emptive download?
No, no.

- One sentence?

Tonight, let's have a quiet night, just on the couch.
That sounds great.
Now, go make those columns someone else's problem.
You're the Acting Head of Obs, for God's sake.
- I will.

Doctor Schumacher, do you have a minute?
I've just been made aware that Dr Clegg's return has been delayed.
What do you mean 'delayed'?
He did not return as expected this morning.
- Why not?

- Well, when's he coming back?

And you expect me to do what about this exactly?
Apparently, I'm now required to deliver the monthly report to you.
Given that there was no handover, I'm not familiar with the report and...

Not possible.
With all due respect, Dr Schumacher, as much as I've relished my time as Acting Head of Obstetrics...
Oh, I'm surprised to hear you say that.
What?
I've heard many whispers voicing concerns about your aptitude for this job.
Concerns from whom?

Just a general view that you've been struggling.
- I'm not struggling.

I'm juggling, but there are lots of balls in the air.
And you're not capable of adding the monthly report ball to the mix?
- I am capable.

Yes, back yourself.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
You can do it.

Consider my questions clarified and I'll deliver the report to you on time, on the 24th.
Well, it's not due until the 25th, but I shall be delighted to receive it a day early.
As I look forward to delivering it to you.
Arsehole.
- This has to be about the boys now.

They keep asking me when you're coming home.
I don't know what to tell them.
Neither do I.
Well, I think they deserve to know where we're going.
I don't know where we're going.
You are unbelievable.
What?
You don't know where we're going either.
I have no idea anymore, but at least I used to know, once upon a time.
- What's that supposed to mean?

You never wanted me like I wanted you.
You lowered your bar to be with me, like you were doing me some kind of favour.
You didn't want a relationship with me, you didn't want to marry me.
No, no.

But I didn't want to marry anyone.
That was never about you.
That was never about you but you made it about you.
You made it a test that I had to pass to prove that I loved you.
Yeah?

- You are a failure.

Because I couldn't study properly.
You failed because you make idiotic decisions and then they... they blow up in your face and you act surprised.
Every decision I have ever made has been about you and the boys.
You bought a fucking caravan with our entire life savings!
I gave you everything you ever asked for!
I worked a shitty job to support you.
I gave you the time and the space that you needed to go to medical school.
I put up with the hours and the sleep deprivation.
And while I was at home raising our sons, separating your whites from your colours, you fucked another man!
I've never been good enough for you and no matter I do, I never will be.
I hate you.
Wait, I think he's coming.

He's coming.
Here he comes, here he comes.

Shh.

What's going on here, hey?

We had one red cordie each.
And there may have been two...

There were...

And we had four mini packets of salt and vinegar chips.
But I had two of them, the boys just had the one each.
We had two red cordies!
- What?

No!

Oh, mate, how'd it go?
Not good.
I told her I hated her.
- Oh.

Well, do you want to go out and get a drink?
No.
Or I could go and get some beers and come back.
I can...

No, no.

Yeah, okay.

- Thanks for looking after them.

- Hey.

- Thanks, mate.

Bye.

Come on, little man.

- Please have a seat.

Anywhere at all.
What brings you here today?
I know I'm catastrophising, but it's coming from a place of real fear.
Okay.
No one's said it out loud, but what if Martin doesn't come back at all?
Am I expected to take over permanently?
Would you want to?
It's not that I haven't enjoyed the challenge, but...

Hm.
Hey, what's happening?
Are you still keen to go out?
'Cause I'm ready to get very, very drunk and lose myself in dance.
Uh, I could not be more available.
Yes to losing self in dance.

- Where are we going?

What's happening where?
Well, Kim and Cherie are doing bumper to bumper.
- Jason's here.

- Can see what?

- What's who doing here?

He's been calling and he's just popped 'round.
He's not staying.
Just wants to spend some time with Bob.
Billie, seriously, can you even hear me?
Jason's here.
Apparently, he wants to spend some time with his son all of a sudden.
I was just about to head off, so, um...
The door hasn't moved.
- Hey, I'll catch you later, huh?

Billie, I know you think he's bad news...
He's not bad news, Brodie.

He's Chernobyl.

Yeah, I don't know what any of those things are.
Okay, okay, we're all tired.

Most of us are angry.
And no good is going to come from words right now.
Now is not the time to have this conversation.

Nina, we're leaving.

Get your dance pants on.

They're going out.

Whoa.

I just want to curl up on the couch with you two.
But I need to be there, for Billie.
Good, good because I want to read some Peter Rabbit tonight.
So, maybe Mum could go and see Aunty Billie, but you and I, we stay here and we find out what happened to Old Mr McGregor.
Yes!
See, 'cause I've been thinking about Mr McGregor all day.
- Have you?

I just feel like I wanna just understand him more.
I want to know what's going on in there.
Thank you.
Whoa.
Shit got in the vacuum cleaner.

I tried!

I just couldn't do it.

Mate, we talked about this.

Outside!

And how did he turn the vacuum on?
- Oh, you are kidding me.

So, did you have any intention of using the crate or were you just flat-out lying to my face?
Both.

I had every intention of trying, but deep down, I knew I'd never do it.
You keep making all these decisions that impact on me, but you're not even asking me what I think.
You're just expecting me to be happy.
Do I look happy?

No.
I found a detailed page in one of your 10-year plans.
The extended version?
The one with the bit about assessing potential long-term partners for maternal aptitude via interaction with a pet, preferably a dog.

Andrew, Andrea, or Greg.
You... you're making it sound like a science experiment.
It's not.

It's a logical process of elimination.
There is nothing logical about any of this.
Where is the logic in forcing someone to be a surrogate parent against their will?
I was not ready for Greg!
What does that mean?
I can't fit into this prefabricated existence.
I don't want to.
And the truth is, I may never be able to give you what you want.
I'm sorry.

Oh, it's much more crowded than I thought it was gonna be.
I'm sorry.

- How've you been?

- Well, what is everyone drinking?

- Mojitos.

Round of mojitos.
Or we could start with a cheeky little Pinot.
- No.

Well, why's it okay for Zara to drink water and I can't have a cheeky Pinot?
- Mojitos!

Aw.

What?

"Just broke up with Will.

- Get her a mojito, too.

- Go on.

Ooh, get me one.
- Make sure you get extra limes.

You look great.
The whole thing was basically an illusion.
Like, the whole relationship was a mirage.
I thought I was ticking boxes, she was ticking boxes.

Turns out, I don't even know what her boxes are.
Hey, how do you tick a box you can't even find?

I've never seen anyone that angry in my life.
Like, she was... raging!
Like, she looked like someone else, like her... her body actually changed shape.
She had, like, bones moving around and she was...
What sort of person puts a dog in a cage, anyway?
Thank you.

I'm drinking from a fancy glass and I'm not itching anywhere!
Hey, so what happened?
I thought Jimmy and Zara were working it out.
Yeah, it went to shit.
Ah.

Not much.
Just the fact that we've been completely hopeless without ya.
Aw.
I know I said I wouldn't bring it up again, but if you had to guess when Martin was coming back...
Oh, I don't know, Neens.

I would be okay with it.
No, because I-I am...

- Billie, you're not dying.

But you are in your prime.
That is true.

You're always welcome under my roof.
Thank you.

And I hereby appoint myself chief engineer and project manager of your sex wall.
What is a sex wall?
It's a protective shield, yeah, where you prevent the romanticising of Mick, while creating new romance with new men.
Did we not just establish that I'm in no mood for nude shenanigans?
You're missing the point.
Yes, it's a hilarious image and a genuine suggestion that you should start having sex with new people, but on a deeper level, it's about creating new memories that remind you how incredible you are without Mick.
Sorry, can we go back a bit?
How do you build a sex wall?
- Did we already cover it?

- Harry.

- Did I wake you?

I just couldn't get the thing... the things out.
My legs weren't helping and then I couldn't find my keys.
Are those not the keys in your hand there?
They were not there a minute ago.
- How was the night?

- Good.

Good.
- And you looked after Zoe.

Did you really though or did you just have a flicker of,
"What the hell am I doing looking after this kid?"
What, are you kidding me?

We read Peter Rabbit and we sang Eensy Weensy Spider.
