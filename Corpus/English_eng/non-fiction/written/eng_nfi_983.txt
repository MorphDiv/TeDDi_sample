50 years have passed.
But I do not age.
Time has lost its effect on me.
Yet the suffering continues.
Aku's grasp chokes the past, present, and future.
Hope is lost.
Got to get back ...

Samurai Jack.
5x07

Oh!

I don't suppose you know if there is a time portal atop this mountain, do you?
No?

Aku has destroyed many.
I worry that there are none left.
Phew!

I didn't think you'd get here so fast.
Fool!
Oh, fun fact ... that was the last remaining time portal in existence!
Ooh, so angry!

Ooh!

Please continue!

Whoa!
Ho, ho!

I know better than to mess with that sword!
But before I go, I'll leave you someone to play with.
And so...

There!
We are here.
- It's not here.

No.

I did not lose the sword... but the sword left me.
- Thank you, friend.

I do not know how long this may take.
- I'll go with you.

It is something that I must do on my own.
Wait, I...
Oh.

- Are you lost?

Good.

Hold it.
Where do you think you're going?
Up the mountain, to kill the samurai.

I'm going to stop you.
Hey, why have we stopped?

It's a girl!

- What did he say?

I love squirrels!

So a little thing like you is gonna stop this whole army, huh?
Yep.
We're gonna rip you apart in a bunch of pieces, and then we're gonna take those pieces and rip them apart into even more pieces!
- I'm waiting.

- Huh?

- Mother?

You were the strongest, but the most unfocused.
Always distracted, questioning everything.
But all that can change.
You can still honor our Lord Father.
Destroy the Samurai, Ashi.
No.

- Jack showed me the truth.

How could you betray your family?
He killed your sisters!

No, you killed them!
We were made for one purpose ...

Our fate was sealed the day we were born!
The samurai is our mortal enemy.
He must die at any cost.
No!
This is terrible.
- Really?

This tea has all the necessary ingredients... but it lacks the most important one ... balance.
I see why your path to the sword remains clouded.
This isn't the path?

- Then you must show me the way!

It is not for me to show you your path.
That's fortune cookie nonsense!
He knows where it is.

Please, you must tell me.
That is something you must earn.
Earn?

Who are you to deny us what is rightfully ours!

Enough.
We have lost the sword because of you.
I have kept us alive!
He's the one who has taken it from us!
He knows where it is!
No.
I've let you consume me for far too long.
You're in my way.
You.
You are the one who has kept the past hidden.
Your anger, your frustration.
You're a fool!
You have blinded us, but now I can see.
You need me!
Now you are balanced.
Like your father, you have been chosen.
To stop a force of ultimate evil.
You are worthy.
Ashi.
- Jack?

You got your sword.
- And a shave and a haircut.

And you...

Ow...
Thank you.
- So, what next?
