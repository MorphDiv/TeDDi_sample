Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
I understood that, conceptually, we were building a world, but I-I didn't expect you would build our entire world.
You heard Radcliffe.
He said he had a subject in the framework, someone who was thriving.
He was talking about May.
She's alive.
I believe it is responsible for all of the alien problems on this planet.
He is always there in the shadows.
We have the inhuman director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
[ Electricity crackling ]
[ Dramatic music plays ]
Well, I'll be.
Ohh!
That hurt.
[ Both grunting ]
Yeah, it hurts.
But the fact that I feel anything at all is what's blowing my mind.
Think that's the point.
All right, that's enough.
[ Exhales sharply ]
Well?
Unbelievable.
It's like the real thing.
I could even smell the sweat.
But I-i felt strangely cold, though.
Well, I tried to make the simulation as real as possible, and since you always leave the air-con on in the base,
I exaggerated it.
Kind of like a silent protest.
That was so realistic.
I think it might play out a little differently in real life.
So, you can feel in there?
It's an immersive sensory experience.
It was designed as a training exercise...
A way for agents to practice sparring or jungle insertions and the like.
Yeah, you can still feel pain while inside.
That's why I stopped the simulation before you hit the wall because...
So, May's locked up somewhere but being held in a virtual reality like this?
What, to keep her placid?
Radcliffe said she was in the framework.
Yeah, but this is a contained prototype.
It's got limited simulations.
If Radcliffe said he built a world, he must have built a separate, more powerful version.
But if it's separate, how will we find it?
Try and locate traces of the source code.
I might be able to locate where Radcliffe is running his new version, and...
And that's where we'll find May.
Sir, the GPS signal we're tracking on the director's suit?
We've locked in on the location.

Unless your intention is to shred the most advanced human mind of this or any century,
I suggest you think twice before forcefully removing him from the framework.

You built a "Matrix" prison, and now May's stuck in it like "Brainscan."
The framework is a tool.
What I'm saying is, if you didn't build a killer robot or a virtual world, this year would've been much easier for us.
Now, whether you like it or not, that's the reality.
I'm trying to help people, mack.
You've got to think about the implications of what you create.

My father worked an oil drill.
He was a son of a bitch, but he worked hard for not much, so I admire him.
The richest man in my town, on the other hand, inherited his money from his father who built airplanes.
He wore furs, was entitled.
When I saw my father with this man, complimenting him, licking his boots...
My admiration for my father evaporated.

Yours is not the only life
Agent Coulson has so easily tossed aside or hidden behind.
This is what he does.
Everything is his S.H.I.E.L.D.
The government, behind you, director, behind Nick fury, stark, all of it, stands agent coulson, quietly pursuing his alien agenda.
Conspiracy theories...
From the man who literally mounted a conspiracy to have men in masks kill inhumans.
I'm closing the door he opened...
Allowing alien races to infect our world and convincing men like you to protect them.
And I will make you admit, to me and yourself, that this is true.

It appears to be pinging from multiple sources.
Cellphones in Atlanta, a military base in Norfolk...

♪♪ [ computer beeping ]
It's the framework code, and it's worse than I feared.
We traced where the data is being processed.
It's everywhere.
What do you mean "everywhere"?
The code is piggybacking on the processors of devices from all over the world.
It's like SETI, only you don't opt in.
If Radcliffe is using this much processing power, the framework reality could be...
Massive.
So you can't track its origin?
Not yet.
Doesn't stay on any one device long enough.
How is all this even possible?
'Cause Radcliffe has the darkhold.
Anything's possible.
We don't leave our people behind.

You have backup?

Do you have partner?
Though, to be honest,
I'm starting to feel some tension, sexual and otherwise, so I was actually thinking about taking a shot, but I'm afraid it could go south.
You Americans, you talk too much.

Our unit has been made aware that an item was found on the premises.
We have been sent to retrieve it.

[ engine revving, tires screeching ]
Looks like your partner was asked to retrieve the item at any cost, as well.
And the cost was you.
Okay, so we think we found the next clue in this fun, little game.
Ivanov mentioned his svr unit being tortured and executed and that he was gonna do the exact same thing to us.
So I looked up svr detention centers connected to the unit number found on the dead agents' uniforms.
And this one right here was a front during the cold war for a submarine base.
And since we know Ivanov has a submarine, like all good bond villains...
We're already en route to the base in krasnoyarsk krai.
Let's assume the enemy knows we're coming.
They've been baiting us this whole time.
We May face strong opposition...
Trap doors, sharks with lasers... who knows?
It doesn't matter.
What matters is getting our people back, so let's get ready.

We found where they're keeping the director and May.
Already en route to the location.

We're going to save them.
What if we can't?
What if May suffers from permanent cognitive dysfunction or cerebral atrophy?
We don't know the adverse effects this could have on her brain.
I did it to her.
Aida, the framework...
My fingerprints are all over these murder weapons.
Mack was right.
Mack was right.
You do need to think about the implications of the things you create.
But just because someone uses your ideas for evil does not make it your fault for creating it in the first place.
You make things from the genius of your mind and the goodness of your heart to help people.
Don't let Radcliffe's actions corrupt that.
You are not responsible for the twisted things he's done.
Wrongs have been committed.
You know, if Radcliffe is operating out of this facility, there May be some framework hardware there.
If I could tap into that directly, then...
Maybe I could find the key to shutting it down for good.
There he is.
Let's get to it already.
This is your last chance, director, to denounce S.H.I.E.L.D. and all that it has done.
Now I ask you...
One last time.
Do you have any regrets?
I believe in agent coulson.
I believe in S.H.I.E.L.D.
Because for all its imperfections, it strives to do the right thing... to protect people.
You claim to fight for others, for humanity.
I think you lost yours a long time ago.
And to answer your question, I do have one regret.
That I don't have any superpowers of my own that I could use to kick your ass.
I can respect a man who stands behind his true beliefs... misguided though they May be.
