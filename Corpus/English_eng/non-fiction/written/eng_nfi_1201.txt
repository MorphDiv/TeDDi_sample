McKenzie:

- Whoa.

Everything you think you know about Face Off, you can just throw out the window.
Oh, shit.
We won't be eliminating a team every week.
McKenzie legitimately scares me.
McKenzie:

Keaghlan and Melissa earned immunity for the next Spotlight Challenge, but Ben and Evan and Stella and Jasmine fell to the bottom and are in danger going into this week's elimination.
We need to make a comeback.
McKenzie:

You will be applying both makeups to one model.
This is not working.
This is gonna look like a mask.
We're totally screwed.
McKenzie:

This is Face Off All-Stars.
It's the morning of our next challenge and we come up to this church.
This is pretty sweet.
Since this is our first elimination challenge, we don't want to hold back.
- Oh, wow.

- This is beautiful.

We're all walking down the aisle and we see McKenzie standing there, and I'm secretly hoping that Niko set the whole thing up and he was gonna have McKenzie marry us 'cause, you know, she's ordained,
but missed opportunity.
Just saying.
- Hey, guys.

Welcome to the beautiful Westminster Presbyterian Church in Pasadena.
You know, they say that religious architecture is designed to make you stop and reflect, so I brought you here today because your next
Spotlight Challenge will require you to look deep inside.
Now, we all have both good and evil traits inside of us, and we've seen them in movies and television shows as the angel and devil sitting on opposing shoulders trying to influence your behavior, so in this Spotlight Challenge, each team will be creating
two makeups...

Sweet.
I'm a theology nerd and I have tons of ideas, so I'm stoked.
But of course there's more.
First, you'll need to use one of your own good traits and one of your bad traits to inspire your angels and devils.
- All right.

Second, we're going to ask you to do something that has never been done before on the show.
Oh.
Because everyone has both an angel and a devil inside, you will be applying both makeups to one model.
- Oh, cool.

Cool.
I have never created a two-in-one makeup, so finding a way to marry the two of those, it's gonna be really challenging.
It's up to you to decide how you are going to incorporate both characters into one creation, but the judges will need to see both clearly reflected in your final creations.
Go ahead and select your traits and get started on your designs.
- Good luck, guys.

Bye.
I think we're both very focused on each... on, like, ourselves.
Okay, so selfishness.
For our good traits and bad traits, we agreed that we're both a little bit selfish, but we're also very giving emotionally a lot to people.
The demon would come out when you see that it's just a skin that it's wearing, and the back of it is this demon with horns.
The devil is actually this parasite who is living inside of the angel, so we're gonna try and have a good, strong contrast to the open hands by creating these laced hands on the back with a spine.
That's a good idea.
I was thinking about the angel representing, like, kindness and giving.
That's... that's definitely my trait too.
We decide our angel is going to be unconditionally selfless to the devil character, who is taking advantage of that kindness, and the devil's eating the angel.
What if we sculpted another...

We're going too big.
No, no, let's slow down.

Ben and I don't want to be on the bottom again, so this is an awesome opportunity to redeem ourselves by creating a really unique, cool makeup.
Demons have horns because it's a broken halo.
Mm-hmm.
So I like the idea that our guy has something that could be seen as horns, but they're just starting to break.
Keaghlan and I want our angel to represent structure and order an also selflessness being consumed by this evil, self-critical devil.
We're going to fabricate and sculpt parts of a bodysuit that'll be this demon consuming our angel.
The bad trait is... it can be anything.
Jasmine and I are trying to see which traits will work, and we're looking at each other like, "Uh...
I don't know, you tell me."
Maybe those psychic vampires that suck the life out of people.
I was thinking that we could put the devil on the chest.
The head and the heart are at odds with each other.
We're bouncing ideas off each other, and it's hard to emulate two characters on one body, and that's what's making this so difficult.
So at this point, Stella and I have no concept, and I know that if you have no concept, you're gone.
What are your traits?
Me and Logan like to take care of people we love, so protection, guardian.
Logan doesn't really have any bad traits, so I'm doing mine, which is lust.
Oh!
I'm trying to come at it from a very abstract, non-traditional way, and I'm really, really worried about going too literal with it.
So we decided to go for a guardian angel who is being seduced by a very beautiful devil caressing him to the dark side.
I'm gonna start throwing some clay on here.
By all means.
- Happy birthday, Tyler Green.

Happy birthday!
What are your traits?
- Creativity...

And our bad trait is self-doubt.
Ah.
And they're constantly warring with one another.
We're creating an angel character who is chiseling armor out of this stone that is literally weighing her down.
How much do you plan on changing the face?
I'm gonna subtly change it.
I want to make it more beautiful, more renaissance.
Yeah, okay.
Ours is loyalty and jealousy.
Oh.
Interesting.
The plot thickens.
Dun, dun, dun!
We wanted to incorporate a lot of our relationship into our makeup, and since we're getting prepared for the next step in our relationship, we're gonna make the angel character into a bride.
This you actually have to sculpt a breast, and you would only be able to see a hint of this.
We're counting on the bridal aspect to help the sell the loyalty factor, and the jealousy is rotting her from the inside out, so you can see her transforming into this devil.
It can be, like, pretty simple.
Not too much texture because you're putting on the texture after, right?
Yeah.
What's tricky is this whole angel and devil on one person.
Yes, I know.
We're still wasting time trying to figure out what it is we're even gonna do.
You want to go with fear?
Yeah, I like that.

Imposter.
Courage.
I'm like, "Okay, we'll go with this one idea where we portray the devil as this goat-like character, and the angel is busting through."
It's not the best idea, but we're gonna run with the concept and see how it all works out.
Our angel has compassion, and she is taken over by our devil, guilt, who is eroding her away.
I just took the window of the church and just flipped it upside down.
That's dope.
I think that'll create the shape to go along with what you have.
Yeah, that's dope.
We see a lot of the architecture in the church that we want to incorporate for the angel, so Tyler and I feel that creating a statue would justify the architecture in the piece because living creatures don't have filigree all over them.
Well, what do you think about the direction I'm going?
Are you worried about it?
Just making sure we're not going too big.
Having been on the bottom in the first challenge definitely makes you second guess yourself.
It's all self-doubt now.
That's one of our weaknesses.
The cowl is starting to look like a devil hoodie, and I'm pretty sure that's not gonna play well.
Yeah, dude, it's gonna look like a fucking mask.
I just don't think there's enough angel in that.
I agree.
It's so important that we have a great makeup on stage, and this isn't gonna work out, so I start ripping off all of this devil hoodie nonsense.
This is, like, going from a hundred to zero, and now I need to immediately start building a new one 'cause otherwise we're totally screwed.
Gonna get rid of this.
I don't need this.
This devil cowl is becoming way too large, so I just start ripping off all of the clay and start blocking out the head of the devil.
I'm gonna build it out back here.
Okay.
Evan and I want to go back to what we originally planned.
Just clean, simple makeups, and so our new concept is that the devil will essentially be wrapping his arms around her and absorbing her, so we want to have, like, a stretch of the skin into the devil's face.
Hi, everybody.
All:

So tell me what you're gonna be doing.
We decided to go more subtle with our appliances.
We're gonna do a beauty makeup on this side and then this side's gonna be...
- Dark and decayed.

A lot of black.
Careful with the black.
You're doing all this wonderful little wrinkles here, and you don't want to bring so much dark color into it you're gonna lose them.
Both:

The demon is actually gonna be facing the same way as the angel, like he's wearing the face.
And there's gonna be a set of broken-off wings.
- You're probably 80% devil...

And this is all you have to go with your angel, so...
Do you think instead of making them the devil's wings, we should make them the angel's wings?
Or make one really broken and make one that's a little bit more angel-like.
That's a great suggestion, actually.
So we have a guardian angel and inside he has this devil of lust.
This face here, is that a face cast?
I got a clay press of the model I liked best and pressed it in there.
Very nice.
As long as it's clay.
She shouldn't be peacefully at rest.
Give her a little bit of an expression.
Okay.
So we are kind of going in this devil realm.
Now, how are you bringing in the angel?
With an open heart.
Okay.
You're looking like you are 90% devil.
What if he had wings?
- And we kind of...

Because then you're talking about here's a devil with wings on it.
Okay.
Well, good-bye and good luck to everybody.
- Bye.

- Thanks.

You want me to help you build that up?
Uh, yeah.
I finished sculpting the cowl and Tyler finishes the back, so now we're gonna start molding.
Getting ready to blow out my candles.
I know, right?
The whole idea is to patina this entire model, and it's so important to have the time to pre-paint everything, so we need to get these pieces finished today.
Bring the muscle down to the shoulders.
You know what I'm saying?
- No.

This is just not working, so we go outside to figure this out.
I don't think our idea is bad.
But it's not reading "angel."
We just got to do more.
Girl, you being stubborn.
We keep just going back and forth.
I'm like, "You're so stubborn."
Clearly, it's a trait we both have, so we're gonna do a bull 'cause bullheadedness represents stubbornness.
So we could have the bull horns.
Mm-hmm.
And then we do, like, some sort of filigree design that indicates openness of the heart.
This angel that's stuck inside of him is pushing out some wings, so he has wing nubs that are going to be emanating light.
Hopefully we're going to make it work.
That's time, everyone!
- Good job.

Join me!

Tyler, come over here!
Come hang out.
- It's our little living room.

What?
All of a sudden, cupcakes come my way, and I'm just like, "Oh, my gosh."
It's totally amazing that I'm able to spend my birthday here on Face Off.
Well, we knew that you were, like, sad that you couldn't be with your real family today.
That's awesome.
So you're with your Face Off family.
That's right!

Yeah.
- Whoo.

Yeah, go team!
Hey, friend, how you doing?
The first thing that I need to get done is finish the sculpture of the face piece while Melissa finishes detailing the torso.
Because our face sculpt is so in-organic and it's really all about symmetry, we want to make sure that I spend as much time as necessary so that it really feels like a statue character.
We can always fabricate that.
I will not have spent all that time on that.
No.
The devil came out of me.
I think it's a risk spending most of my time on the halo, but I think it could pay off in a really good way.
Look at that.

Ben's arm is looking amazing.
The face is looking awesome, so we're just really happy that we get to actually show our sculpting skills as opposed to the first challenge.
The devil has a horn and the angel has a halo.
We're a little bit worried that it's too on the nose, but you know what?
It's angel and devil and to represent it metaphorically seems wrong, so I think we're doing the right thing.
I'm not gonna feel bad about being eliminated on this because it's awesome.
Fingers, fingers, fingers.
It's really important for our character that we convey selfishness through the fingers lacing on the back section, so Gage and I make a press mold out of silicone because sculpting those fingers is gonna take a while.
Now I can use some of the wet clay to push into the mold and make myself fingers that I could put into the back.
Do you think it reads as spine?
- That's my biggest issue.

Yeah.

Absolutely.
You gonna be ready to mold anytime soon, Adam, do you think?
I think so.
I get the devil face to a point where I can mold it, but there's a lot of details and a lot of nuances in the sculpture, and I'm really worried about having enough time to paint it on application day.
What's on your mind, dude?
Nothing.

It's my internal artist struggle.
If you don't have time to paint it and make it pop, it really doesn't matter how much effort you put into it, but at this point we have to execute what we have and hopefully do it well.
Yesterday, we wasted so much time trying to figure out how to portray these traits that we have to scramble to get everything done.
Now we're going to open a really crap-ily made mold for our wing nubs that has been rushed 'cause we have very little time.
Ooh, it's so squishy.
Ooh, it did not set.

Even though it's hard on the outside, it's still soft on the inside.
We might have to re-mold it.
I've just completely ruined the mold and I have to sculpt it all over again.
I'm not gonna take it apart.
All ready we're set back, so I don't know how we're going to come back from this.
I'm about to give up because I have no fight left in me.
Ooh, it did not set.

I tried to open my mold too early and it's all mushy on the inside, so I completely ruined the sculpt and the mold.
That's really what just happened.
I'm gonna have to re-mold it.
Let's just take it back inside.
It's not gonna happen.
And now I have to sculpt these little nubs all over again.
I'm going to be molding and running pieces on application day.
That really sucks.
Gonna re-sculpt these.
When you get in here, it might look cool, like, when you start curving it.
Okay, then I'll just...

Cat told me I should cover the whole thing in feathers
I'll put a little bit more here and see how I am on time and... and keep going.
Okay.
I got almost, like, ten-feet long wings.
I'm getting a little worried if I should be spending that much time on these wings, but I really trust whatever Cat wants to do for this makeup.
Wings are gonna look awesome, baby.
You're crazy, Cat.
While George is molding,
I'm gonna start fabricating the headpiece.
I grab some L200...
Cut different circles.
I'm gonna use hot give to give the illusion that it's those little lead strips between the glass panes and paint vacuform plastic so it looks like an actual stained glass window.
I really want this headpiece to bring a lot of attention to the face, so I essentially want her face to be at the center of creativity.
When this is on her, like, completely, then we can drip everything out of it.
Yeah.
We're feeling pretty good.
We got all of our pieces done, and we're just focusing on pre-painting because this paint job requires a lot of layers.
The back piece already looks like a bronze sculpture.
That's cool.

All right, guys, that's time!
- Dude.

Team Merewolf.
Yeah!
- Yeah!

Whoo!
- That does look pretty good.

Ooh, the foam's nice...

Yeah.
We can make it work with the makeup.
Everything looks great, so we just really got to get these little wing nubs molded right away.
Jasmine takes them to mold in silicone and then I start patching and seaming that cowl.
Once the silicon modes have cured all the way,
I pop out the clay and then I pour poly foam into them.
There's a lot to do, but hopefully... fingers crossed...

- Hi, how are you?

Hello, hello.
- How's it going, man?

I don't know.

The halo has a wire to keep it stable, but it's a lot heavier than I thought, so this is not gonna work.
But if you need me to fabricate something quick,
I can do that too.
So Melissa goes back into the mold room and starts to fabricate a halo while I apply the face base.
I'm a perfectionist, and immunity or not,
I want a good makeup out on that reveal stage.
Our halo didn't work.
Oh.
Wow, that does line up freaking amazing.
We get the devil face and the arms glued on and it actually fits almost perfectly.
All the proportions work out very nicely and the edges look great.
I'm so stoked.
Evan and I are really happy about the way this makeup is coming together.
Oh, it's so cool.
There you go.
I think that'll really hold now.
We get the pieces down.
Things look nice.
The profile looks cool, so now it's time to paint.
The only problem is I can't really paint the devil until the angel's painted because it involves a lot of spattering and over-spraying, so the longer it takes to paint the angel, the longer it takes to get to the devil,
and that really is the centerpiece of the makeup.
Hey, Rach, tell me what you think of this.
The finger section on our back piece is pretty messed up, so I take the finger blenders that I made the first day and use those over the back.
We are not happy about doing this on application day, but it's all we have, and we just got to keep moving forward.
Oh, it's so much better.
What do you think about this, Cat?
You like that?
Beautiful.

While Niko starts going in with all these grays and blacks,
I'm gonna do classical bridal makeup on the other side.
I'd like the finish with all the modeling.
We really don't want the makeup to look like it's just split exactly, perfectly down the middle, so Niko's making sure to bring some color over on the beautiful angel side, so we have this nice zigzag line going down.
I think it's looking great.
15 minutes!
All right, everybody, that's time!
Right now it looks like a face stuck on.
I'm worried that our concept might be difficult to justify exactly what is going on.
It's both abstract and literal, and if the judges think that's confusing, it could be a problem.
Okay, here we go.

Contacts.

We still have a lot to do in Last Looks.
I want to finish all the detail that we have so we can really sell that devil character.
I'm working on the back.
Rachael has based him out in a vibrant red and purple, but I think it's a little bit too vibrant, so I tone it down.
We have to darken it up.
And it's looking great.
- You okay?

We have a lot of painting to do, but there's still some costume elements that also need to be completed, including applying the cape, attaching feathers to the back, finishing his loincloth, and making sure the wig looks good.
Ten minutes!
That's time, everybody!
Don't leave me hanging.
I'm so excited.
Time is up, and I know Stella and I are in trouble.
I don't see a devil.
I don't see an angel.
I'm not happy.
Welcome to the Face Off reveal stage.
Say hello to our incredible judges... owner of Alchemy Studios, Glenn Hetrick.
Good evening.
All:

Oscar and Emmy-award winning makeup artist, Ve Neill.
- Hi, guys.

And creature and concept designer Neville Page.
Hello.
All:

All right, guys, let's just get right to it.
For your Spotlight Challenge, we asked you to create both an angel and a devil makeup inspired by two of your own personality traits, and in an added twist, we asked that you apply both makeups to one model.
All right, let's take a look at your creations.
We're really nervous, but I can't believe that we pulled it together.
Maybe we will be safe.
I don't know.
It reads from every direction.
We're really happy with it and it looks really cool.
She looks awesome.
From design to execution,
Cig and I are so happy with this.
It's exactly what Tyler and I wanted.
It is a makeup that we're both proud of.
The paint job is almost where I want it.
Hopefully it will be clear to the judges that we've done a good job of executing the positive and negative traits.
It is very different than the rest of the makeups, hopefully in a good way.
Rachael and I are both really unsure about this makeup.
There's more devil here than angel, and I'm not sure whether we're gonna be in top, bottom, or safe.
She has a great silhouette.
The wings are huge.
They take almost half the stage.
I think it just looks awesome.
Okay, judges, why don't you take a closer look at tonight's makeups.
I really wish they would've been more mindful of his anatomy.
The forms don't integrate to his body at all.
It doesn't make sense for the angel/demon thing.
And the horns resemble slugs.
I don't get that at all.
Oh, this is cool.
There's a whole demon face here.
I didn't even see it until we got up close.
One thing about it though.
This little detail coming off the side, it looks like cathedral stained glass, but it feels Native American with the wings sticking off the side of the circle.
This is so beautiful.
The color is fantastic.
Yeah.
The shapes coming off of the head thrill me.
I don't know, man.
It doesn't make sense to me.
The angle of this is so jammed on.
There had to be a better way to position that to get it to flow into his form.
I do love this back piece though.
I think that is quite fabulous.
I think that this paint is not good.
I think it got way too muddy, which is unfortunate.
Even better close up.
The level of detail on this facial makeup alone is enough to make me love it.
And it's a really beautiful beauty makeup as well.
Okay, the judges have scored your creations, so let's find out what they thought.
Emily and Tyler.
Logan and Adam.
Ben and Evan.
Cat and Niko.
Stella and Jasmine.
You are the best and the worst, and the judges would like to speak with you before making their decisions.
That means the rest of you can head back to the makeup room.
Thanks, you guys.

Good luck.
Ben and Evan, please step up.
Evan and I were in bottom looks last challenge, and I know if we're in the bottom again, we're gonna be sent home.
Ben and Evan, please step up.
Hi, guys.
Tell me about the concept and how you tried to represent your traits in this makeup.
Our angel represents unconditional peace and giving, and our devil represents taking advantage of kindness and mistaking it for weakness.
I think it's artistically beautiful.
You hearken back to the golden age of makeup effects with the way that you handled the devil.
I love the stretchy face, and the horn is quite brilliant, the angle, the size.
Nice sculpting in there, guys.
- Oh, thank you.

I think your angel is quite exquisite.
You've got this beautiful, luminescent face, and then she turns sideways and you've got this hideous creature coming out.
Everything is so well thought out.
- You did a great job.

There's so much that you've addressed, and you didn't make it overt, which is in stark contrast to last week.
Ben and Evan, thank you very much.
If you'd please step back.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Logan and Adam, please come forward.
- Good evening.

Tell us about your concept.
Our angel/devil makeup is an archangel who is giving into his primal, lustful urges.
He feels less of an angel and severs his own wings off.
So this is the devil creature coming out?
- This is the devil, yes.

Okay.
This is really not a very successful makeup.
All of his coloring is very muddy.
This skin on his body is a yellowish gray and his face is almost completely gray.
I'm sorry, I just...

You guys can really sculpt.
You have interesting ideas, but it feels ridiculous in the head, the hair, and you should've seen that yourselves.
It doesn't really work to have that hand coming out of the side of his chest.
I like the concept of the succubus, it's just the way that you fit it onto his body that's so troublesome.
Logan and Adam, if you'd please head back.
Thanks.
Let's talk to Emily and Tyler.
- Hello, guys.

Tell us about your concept.
Our devil trait is guilt and our angel trait is compassion.
Guilt can eat away at you and corrode you, and we wanted to translate that into the design.
This is an exquisite visage.
The precision and the accuracy of the erosion and the tarnish feels so authentic.
- Congratulations.

The shapes on top of the head, absolutely beautiful, and they feel taken from religious architecture without being too literal.
Super impressive work, guys.
Both:

This makeup is so gorgeous and so beautifully done.
The sculpture on her back that you've placed that wing into, you handled that so well.
Thank you very much.
Emily and Tyler, you can step back.
Thank you.
Stella and Jasmine, please step up.
Go over your conceptualization process for me, if you will.
We both agreed on stubbornness and we both agreed on an open heart.
The angel is within him and battling with his head and saying, "I want to escape."
I feel like you haven't managed to complete your own concept.
Sculptures are soft and round and the forms are meandering, and that confuses me.
This doesn't feel angelic nor devilish, really.
It's sort of a creature.
I feel like the chest is not an organic piece at all.
It's nothing that says that that is his heart.
It's just an appliqué stuck on there.
Also, the paint job is very muddy.
It's just all over the place and very disconnected.
One thing I really do like about this is your palette, but it's not enough to elevate this in any way.
Thank you.
Stella and Jasmine, you can head back.
Cat and Niko, please come forward.
Hi, Cat and Niko.
Both:

Can you please tell us how you used your traits in conjunction with your makeup?
So the traits that we decided to choose are loyalty to represent our angel and jealousy to represent our devil.
She's overcome with jealousy and it's turning her into this devil from the inside out.
It's just rotting her away.
I think it's awesome.
Oh, thank you.

- Thank you.

Your wings are, like, stupendous, and this is probably the most beautiful beauty makeup we've had on this show.
Very nice job, you guys.
- Thank you so much.

Big, profoundly strong in regard to its silhouette, and defying the laws of physics.
I'm referring to your hair.
How the hell do you do it, man?
You can say, "All right,
I'm gonna do this incredibly large silhouette,"
and that could so easily not have worked, so congratulations on pulling it off.
Both:

Cat and Niko, please step back.
- Thank you so much.

Thank you.
Okay, if you'd please head back to the makeup room while the judges deliberate.
All:

Thank you so much.
All right, judges, why don't we talk about the looks that you liked the most this week.
Let's start with Ben and Evan.
They really did such a great job this week compared to last week.
This is really a cool makeup.
The flow of the horn from the tip all the way down the body was really quite beautiful.
Love the devil face, and I especially love it when she brings her arm over and you have the framing of that face and the way it comes off of the good side.
All right, let's move on to Emily and Tyler.
It was lacking in the recognition of the angel and devil.
That being said, the makeup was so gorgeous.
The way they managed to convey the erosion was so good.
And that fallen wing and the S shapes to it,
I thought that it was integrated into Nayeli's form perfectly.
All right, let's move on to Cat and Niko.
Well, they did a great job this week too, and you saw the character traits that they were trying to portray.
The short hand version of their wings still conveyed an anatomically-correct-looking wing.
That is very difficult to pull off.
The amount of detail and accuracy that went into the veining, beautifully done.
All right, judges, let's move on to the makeups that weren't so successful.
Let's talk about Stella and Jasmine.
No matter what, you've got to make it beautiful, and they've not done that for the past two weeks.
The fact that they had two lighting features that were completely buried is such a poor use of time.
In terms of the angelic side, it was just odd, asymmetrical filigree with a heart in the middle.
His horns look like slugs.
There was nothing masculine or frightening or devilish about it.
And finally, Adam and Logan.
Last week, the top of the thing was amazing.
But the concepts aren't clicking.
The choice of putting that wig on that character was frightening.
That whole makeup was disproportionate.
The head looked like it was just a block that was placed inside of a box and stuck on the chest.
The hands were too big for the head.
I don't know what they were going for there.
All right, then, judges, have you made up your minds?
- We have.

Excellent.

All right, Glenn, tell us about the top teams.
Ben and Evan, you did some beautiful sculpting.
We loved the flow of the makeup from the horn down into the body.
Great comeback this week.
Cat and Niko, there was some exquisite paint work on your character, and those wings were just unbelievably well constructed and realized.
Okay, so who is our winning team?
Our winning team tonight is...
All right, Glenn, so who is our winning team?
Our winning team tonight is...
Cat and Niko.
This makeup best captured the spirit of this challenge and you guys made some really smart decisions, how you portrayed your personality traits within the character.
- Thank you so much.

We really appreciate it.
- Yeah, we win.

It's awesome.
I want to cry I'm so excited, especially since it had so much of us in the makeup.
- It was all you.

- No, good job, you.

No, you were...

Cat and Niko, congratulations.
You, Ben and Evan, Emily and Tyler are all safe and can head back to the makeup room.
All:

All right, guys, that means the rest of you are on the bottom, and two of you will be going home tonight.
Please step forward.
All right, Glenn, tell us about the bottom teams.
Logan and Adam, while the sculpting definitely showed off how talented both of you are, the makeup felt disconnected in terms of design.
Stella, Jasmine, there were some beautiful elements to your makeup, but the fact that you were struggling conceptually was really apparent.
So which team is going home tonight?
The team going home tonight is...
Stella and Jasmine.
Between the confused character that you presented and the fact that it was the second week on the bottom, it was really hard for us to justify sending anyone else home.
Stella and Jasmine, I'm sorry, but you have been eliminated.
That means Adam and Logan, you are safe this week and can head back to the makeup room.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Come here, you.
Judges, anything you'd like to say to Stella and Jasmine?
I would, please.
There's plenty of positive that we've experienced and seen you do, so make sure that that's what you take away and continue doing what you're so good at.
We'll miss you.
Thank you so much.
Stella and Jasmine, it's been so great having you with us again.
If you'd please head back to the makeup room and pack up your kits.
We're the first to go home.
I know, and it's a little embarrassing.
Well, we're an all-star.
That's true.
Stella and Jasmine.
All:

Sorry, guys.
I'd love to stay longer, but it feels so good to have competed with these guys.
I'm just so honored to be here.
It's getting dusty.
I'll never be less hard on myself.
I'm still gonna be a makeup artist.
That's my life.
I think we did a lot of really beautiful work, and I'm so proud.
Love you.
Mean it.
