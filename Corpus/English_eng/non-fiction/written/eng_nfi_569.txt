Previously on "Shades of Blue"...
It's one thing running drugs;

Quince is a street thug trying to get out of prison.
I'll never trust you again.

I will not let her go down.
When my daughter died,
Nate took a bat to the dealer who sold her the drugs and left him lying in the street.
Julia covered it up.
- The Feds are chasing Bianchi.

I want to make sure that they don't get you instead.
Julia.

Woz, get down!
You got to get him to the hospital!
You're gonna hunt these shooters down.
Where's Bianchi?
All right, I'll tell you!
Bianchi's got dirt on everybody who's anybody in New York.
- Where does he keep this dirt?

There's a box locked up there.
Get the box, and we'll get him.
- What's the charge this time?

Are you trying to make a career of losing prosecutions based on planted evidence?
Why make it quick, when he can face a lifetime locked up as a cop shooter?
Closure.
What made you decide to come in today?
Uh... uh...
It wasn't a decision.
Is this a mandatory visit?
Something that happened at work?
Yeah, something like that.
I...

Would you like to talk about that?
I get a lot of cops that come in here after traumatic experiences.
Let's consider this a preemptive strike.
There's something on the horizon?
Justice.
I mean, it comes for us all in the end.
The tricky part is keeping it contained to the people that deserve it.
Not guilty.
And on the second count, murder in the first degree of Miss Elena Costa, how do you plead?
Not guilty.
Mister Gomez?
Given the brutal nature of this double homicide and that Mr. Bianchi as recently as two days ago deceived customs officials into believing he left the country, the people request that the defendant remain detained without bail.
Mr. Kirschner?
Your Honor, the guilt or innocence of my client...
I thought Judge Gibson drew the case?
Gibson had some sort of bizarre fender bender at lunch.
They replaced him with Lowry.
For the arraignment?
The entire case now.
So based on the various attempts at false convictions, and the NYPD's continuous harassment of my client,
I ask the court to please release Mr. Bianchi on his own recognizance until trial.
Your Honor, the NYPD has been a target...
Sit down, Mr. Gomez.
Save your opening statement for another day.
Bail's set at $2 million, pending the surrender of Mr. Bianchi's passport.
Thank you very much, Your Honor.
I would have led with flight risk.
That's all the court cares about.
So the DA assigned the second best prosecutor in the office.
The strategy was to hold Bianchi on the double homicide while we linked him to the attempted hit on your crew.
And Caroline?
Even if we could prove Bianchi ordered her murder, my boss feels it's a separate incident.
So does that mean he's letting you consult on this?
There's still the issue of the girlfriend.
What girlfriend?
My conflict of interest.
She's one of the cops Bianchi went after.
I told my boss about us.
High profile nature of this case, he needed to know.
Officially.
Let me take you to lunch.
You hungry?
I could eat.
Oops.
What?
It's a good thing that we're official.
I think I just branded you.
I'll meet you out front.
Bathroom open?
Yeah, all done.
Harlee.

Bianchi made bail.
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of him being out and about.
I mean, things could go south fast.
He already shot Nate and kidnapped Christina.
I don't know how much further south it could go.
Anything in Bianchi's box of secrets on a Judge Lowry?
Not that I remember.
It's... it's back at the house.
Did Bianchi have anything on us?
Not yet, but there are four thumb drives that I can't open.
It's... it's some kind of encryption.
I figure Bianchi's biggest fireworks are on that.
Harlee?
Harlee?
A hazard of illicit affection.
Take it you brought your passport.
You've taken quite an interest in me,
Counselor.
Homicide tends to get my attention.
Tell me, which is worse?
The corrupt cop who feigns innocence or the self-righteous fool who falls for it?
Don't.
Don't talk to me about innocence.
Why would I slip a bloody Sap into the pocket of a Brunello Cucinelli suit and then sit down at dinner, especially when
I have guys to handle such things not three tables away?
Oh, I got a theory.
Oh, so do I.
You've been bewitched, my friend.
Since I didn't get to try your case, let's get this on record now.
You're a murderer, and you're a coward.
But I'm not blind.
You got pinched.
Do the time like a man.
Don't go after the family of civil servants.
Family, is that what you're calling her now?
The poor girl you left at the altar just so you could bang that bitch in blue?
You should be thanking me.
I got rid of your ex.
I can get rid of your current problem in much the same way.
He, uh... he threatened me.

I didn't...
Go, get help.

No, wait, James, wait.
Can you tell me your name?
I hit him.
He slammed his head against the sink on the way down.
Squeeze my hand.
Is he moving?
I think his neck is broken.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
You can't be here.
Listen to me.
- He assaulted you.

He threatened me.

No, you were defending yourself.
Harlee, we don't have time to debate this.
He threw you up against this mirror.
Harlee!
And came at you with this piece of glass.
- I need you to leave right now.

I'm calling 911, and you cannot be a part of this.
I wasn't.
I will not let this man hurt you.
Harlee,
I hurt him.
You can either explain that he stabbed you..
Or I did.
Won't just be me explaining.
Yes, it will.
Harlee, what are you doing?
Harlee.
He was dead when he hit the ground.
That's not true.
The truth is in the paperwork.
Oh, my God!
What happened?
James, you're bleeding.
Call security!
Somebody get some help!
I love you.
Bianchi?

Somebody attacked him in the bathroom.
We think they're still in there.
We need backup to the mezzanine now.
There's been an assault.
What have we done?
We protected each other.
So the mobster's not a problem anymore.
What do you care?
Bianchi gets killed, we don't have the satisfaction of taking him down ourselves.
Well, at least we can breathe a little easier.
Or not.
Hey, guys, come on.
Can you put a sheet over these bodies or something?
- Let's go.

Y'all lost the streets.
Hey, Devonte, these your guys?
Look at those kids.
Weeks of nightmares courtesy of the 64.
This ain't on us.
All we do is regulate where you deal.
Your personal beefs?

I'm done here.
You didn't see the shooters?
Huh, no vehicle description?

Only thing I can give you is a motive.
Quince.
Where'd you find this?
Someone put it in his hand.
Guess they wanted to make sure you got the message.
Quince is coming after you.
It's a personal dispute, just not with me.
Tell Wozniak he has a war coming his way.
- Oh, hey.

Nate said you'd be here soon.
So you're making your getaway?
No, press event.
It's getting close.
You can't play the underdog card anymore.
We're trending in the right direction.
Voters respond to strength.
And I would vote for that boy of yours.
How's he doing?
He has your attitude towards pain.
If you don't acknowledge it, it isn't there.
Your mother didn't threaten to take those away so you can get some rest?
She tried.
I convinced her to go home and get some sleep.
I thought we were almost out of time there for a minute.
The stubborn gene comes in handy, huh?
Yeah.
Do you remember an article you wrote about a year ago, hacker culture in Brooklyn?
You read that?
I read everything that ever had your name on it.
There's a cache data on this, but it's encrypted.
Are you in touch with any of those guys?
Maybe they could help you open it, without seeing what the content is?
What's on them?
It's recordings that the Mob uses to blackmail people.
And there might be some names you recognize.
Yours?
It's possible.
You know that lyric about how everything is cracked because that's how the light gets in?
Can't say that I do.
It makes sense to me now.
Things... break, and light forces its way into the dark places and illuminates what matters.
And what's that?
Forgiveness.
The man is lucky you like him.
I'm not sure he feels that way.
Bianchi's organization, they're not gonna hit back.
They know that he went rogue and that he made this personal.
I should have stayed away from Nava when he asked me to.
If he really wanted to stay away from you, he could have.
The thing that pisses me off is that he deprived me of the chance of bashing Bianchi's brains in myself.
It was an accident.
As long as he sticks to that story.
Strange thing is
I almost hope he can't.
I feel like I dragged him into this world and I'm terrified that he won't get out.
Hol... hold on.
You did what you had to do.
Most people aren't built like us.
They can't pay the price for what's necessary.
Yeah?
You didn't take any painkillers, did you?
No, but I wouldn't mind.
You can't afford to lose your edge.
Not with the questions you're gonna have to answer.
I won't put you in the middle of this, but I'm an officer of the court.
I have to tell them what happened.
It was him or you.
That's a fact, James.
It doesn't mean it has to destroy your life.
He taunted me, about Caroline.
He threatened me about you.

I let him get to me.
And that truth can hurt you.
Tell them Bianchi offered you a bribe to make his case go away, and you told him to go to hell.
All right, you were defending yourself.
You had no choice.
Everything is gonna be okay.
Saying it doesn't make it so, Harlee.
I'm...

Do you?
'Cause you seem pretty skilled at creating your own reality.
I was doing what had to be done.
You killed a man with your bare hands and covered it up.
It was like a switch flipped, and you became a...
What?
A stranger.
What do you want to do?
Read my diary?
Play truth or dare?
Sure, let's go.

Truth.
Last month, when all this started, before Caroline, before all the madness, did you plant that weapon on Bianchi?
What... you're taking Bianchi's word now?
You're the one that wanted to play, Harlee.
Is it true?
There's my answer.
Look, it's not that simple.
Yeah?
Then try this one.
Who the hell are you?
Never been in the precinct without cuffs before.
Figured these would give me safe passage.
Well, you know, it's a myth that all cops like doughnuts.
Well, I had to try something.
Wasn't sure that anyone would believe that my little bro needed help.
Oh, you'd be surprised.
All right, man, Devonte's boys got popped.
What can you tell us about how Quince runs his drug operation?
You can't be serious.
There were bullet holes in a jungle gym, Wallace.
I know how this works.
I talk, a bunch of teenage lookouts ain't even started their lives yet catch felony charges, and the shot callers skate away free.
Not today.
No pawns off the board today.
We're gonna go for the king.
Quince is already in jail.
We're not talking about court justice.
Quince buys his own credit, depends on sales to pay his debt.
Now, we take his product, he has no means to survive.
What you need?
All right, you drove a shipment for Quince before, right?
Yeah.
Was it headed to the stash house?
Yeah.

He has three?
And guards each like a fortress.
Woz, I think we should talk to Narco about this.
No.
This is between us and Quince.
We don't have enough man power to bust three stash houses.
Then we'll get him to consolidate.
I'll take it from here, Lewis.
You got it.
Same time tomorrow, Christina.
No, you're back on roll call tomorrow.
The threat has been officially neutralized.
Peace of mind meant a lot.

- Yeah, thanks.

What, no armed escort today?
Oh, just an armed mother.
A good excuse for me to leave early, spend some time with my girl.
That's what house arrest is for.
You're officially up for parole.
Seriously?
I get the car back?
For now.
Bad guy that I was worried about got into a... fatal accident.
What happened?
Call it justice.
The main thing is we get to have our lives back.
Well, good, because that ferry ride to Jersey makes me so seasick.
I would rather supervise a night of truffle fries with you and James.
Oh, I can deliver on the fries.
I don't know about the rest.
What?
Mom, already?
Too nice?
Liked you too much?
I-I just don't think I'm the one for him.
Well, did he say that?
No, he didn't have to.
He thinks I'm somebody I'm not.
Don't do that.
Mom, you have to give him a chance.
Show him the real you.
Lieutenant.
You got my invitation.
I did, Quince.
Came to pay my respects to the dead.
A little early for that.
You see, prison is kind of like Monopoly.
I'm safe and sound and still collecting money.
Luck changes very quickly in our game.
Don't matter.
Can't stop the trade.
But maybe we can both profit.
That boat's already sailed.
Arrest warrants for your people and your stash houses is happening as we speak.
You got to find them first.
41 Ashland, 216 Flushing.
We identified them both.
What you offering?
A warning.
Learn to suck real good, because once you're out of business, the protection that you get in here is gonna dry up very fast.
Yeah, I'd say he was rattled.
I'd put the drugs moving within the hour, all headed to the third stash house.
Yeah, okay.
Ellen.
How you feeling?
Wait, what?
Your heart rate is elevated.
Not what we like to see in patients recovering from major surgery.
Wait, I need that.
What you need is rest.
You want to go home eventually, don't you?
If you need me, you know where the button is, okay?
Try to sleep.
Wozniak.
Don't ruin my day.
Dad, when you get this, come to the hospital.
There's something you got to hear.
So what's on your mind, Lieutenant Peters?
Right now?

It's got to have a bigger meaning to you to have these poor saps just staring at it for an hour.
A bridge.
You're here, you want to get there, so you build a connection.
Yeah, mental health has never been my thing.
But today was different.
I got surprised.
You don't strike me as a person that gets surprised very often.
Are you?
Got your message.
What'd you find?
Guess you didn't get my last two messages.
It was a... false alarm.
No, I got them.
But when you leave two messages saying that something's a false alarm, it's not a false alarm.
What did you find?
A voice I recognized.
Whose?
I'm sorry, Dad.
All this heat, why not get out of the city?
If you abandon your kingdom, you give up control.
You stood us up the other night.
The campaign takes priority.
I can't control last-minute changes.
Once I reach the top,
I can make sure we're untouchable.
I know.
That's why I promise to get you there.
The assassination attempt did well for you.
Six points.
I should have had her graze my shoulder.
The sling would have played so nicely in photo ops.
I admire the instinct.
Always looking for an edge.
Just like I have the instinct now to know this isn't why you called me here.
I don't think you missed our meeting because of the campaign.
I think you were warned off by Wozniak.
I also think you know who put him onto me.
If I knew, I...
No, don't try and spin this one, Julia.
The FBI.
They have their hooks in him deep.
The FBI?
And you didn't want to share this before now?
I wasn't sure.
Wozniak's more of an ally than you realize.
He will never let the Feds get to me.
Maybe not.
But he has got no qualms about leading them to my doorstep.
I wouldn't be here if it weren't for him.
I wouldn't be anywhere.
Well, that's heartwarming, but he's the biggest liability you have.
Well, there's you.
I hope you consider me more of a, um, a sponsor.
Aligned interests.
And you can't keep us both.
He is a good man.
Say something nice at his funeral.
Oh, come on, Julia, you know it has to be done.
So what?
You brought me here to ask for my approval?
No.
I'm giving you a heads-up.
I know all about your occasional late-night visits.
Don't find yourself at Wozniak's house tonight.
His house?

Oh, he signed up for collateral damage a long time ago.
Wozniak lives by a code.
If you violate his home, his family, he'll come after you.
Are you saying that you choose him?
I am saying...
You better not miss.
Mr. Nava, thanks for coming in.
I know it's been a rough day.
For the record, you're waiving your right to have your attorney present.
I don't need an attorney to tell you what happened.
Your prior contact with Michael Bianchi, that was in the context of your job as an ADA?
Yes.

The case was dismissed.
Your ex-girlfriend was gunned down by a man allegedly working for Mr. Bianchi.
Is that correct?
Caroline Winston.

Did Bianchi seek you out in the courthouse, or did you make contact with him?
He came looking for me.
Was it to discuss that prior incident?
Come on, James.

Mr. Nava?
Did Bianchi say why he wanted to speak to you in private?
He, um... he offered me a bribe, help make this latest charge go away.
And what was your response?
I told him to go to hell.
He attacked me.
He stabbed my arm.
Came at me again, I pushed him back.
So much violence.
His head hit on the sink.
Then what happened?
I went to get help.
I-I-I tried saving him.
Taking notes on how to be a detective?
I was defending myself.
Are you currently in a relationship with Detective Harlee Santos?
What?
Law enforcement is a small town.
Hard to keep things quiet.
Yes, we're dating.
Was Detective Santos present at the courthouse?
She was, for the arraignment.
Did she go in the bathroom?
No.
She ran over when I called for help.
Learn anything?
Always.
Uh, Loman said Quince took the bait.
His other two stash houses are cleaned out.
They're following the carrier here.
- Are they close?

And Wallace is sure the runner's gonna come this way?
As soon as the house spots police, yeah.
Smart system.
Unless some detectives are waiting to take your entire supply.
Yo, pipe down up there, Woz.
Huh?
What?
Hey, yo, you lost?
Actually, yeah, maybe you could help.

Is this address right?
Police.

Yo, five-O!

Okay, Espada and Loman announced themselves.
Won't be long now.
There it is.
Police!

Drop it right now!
♪ It turns me on...
- Yo, Woz.

You know, my buddy's a lawyer?
He specializes in workplace harassment.
Says office romances paid for his summer house.
Yeah, can I get his number?
There's this creep who hangs out at my desk.
Hey.
I'd like to talk to you about what happened.
Not the day, Verco.
Mills was supposed to leave me a file.
Oh.

You know, I studied forensics before I joined Internal Affairs.
Turns out I prefer dealing with folks that are still alive, you know?
Yeah.

It's amazing what you can learn from the smallest things.
For instance, fabric fibers.
If everything Nava's saying is true,
Bianchi's jacket should be covered in fibers from Nava's vest.
It's all in the details, right?
Right.
But...
I guess we'll have to wait until tomorrow.
The M.E. won't get to the autopsy until morning.
Why are you telling me this?
Because details matter.
You're right about that.
The rest is just a scare tactic.
Good luck, Detective.
Rough collar?
The runner resisted.
Resisted what?

No, that he was unsuccessful.
What's going on with Julia?
What?
I'm gonna go see about some loose ends.
Hey.
You, um, think you can lend a girl a scotch?
Thought you'd be acquiring the taste of champagne.
It's not what you drink.
It's who you drink it with.
No need to butter me up, Julia.
We've known each other too long.
Yeah, we have.
Are you okay?
I thought I'd get a chance to off Bianchi myself.
Yeah.
That ADA sure did us all a service.
Well, you're out from under his thumb.
Mm-hmm.
Let's just say
I haven't had to reach for any tissues.
I was thinking... about Anna Kate today.
About the time that she tried to sneak out.
She was 12.
The screen from the window was outside on the ground.
And she had mud all over her shoes.
Hmm.
The kid forgot that her dad's a cop, a cop who's seen what could happen when a kid sneaks out.
Mm, yeah.
We've all seen that.
I told Linda I was gonna strangle her.
But I didn't get the chance because...
She came down, and she admits everything.
She had these tears in her eyes, and all the... the... the... anger inside just melted away.
She came clean without knowing that she was caught.
She really was a great kid.
Yeah.
So...
What do you need?
There was a, uh, break-in at Bianchi's lawyer's office two days ago.
Thieves cracked the safe, made off with a box that belonged to him, totally clean.
Sounds like a, uh, a pro job.
Bianchi kept dirt on pretty much every player in the city.
I need to know if there is anything on my opponent.
So you could feed it to the press.
This race is gonna be one of the closest in history, so what benefits me benefits you.
It benefits everyone.
There's nothing on Daniels.
What about me?
I'll take care of it.
Harlee, what are you doing?
Please just don't stop me, or I won't be able to do this.
You want the truth.
Yes.
I planted that weapon on Bianchi.
And Caroline got killed because of it.
I asked my friend Caddie to keep a secret for me, and he got killed because of it.
Harlee, what...
There's more.
Miguel came to my house.
Miguel, he's back in town?
No.
The night before I told you he left, he came to my house.
And he said he was gonna hurt Christina.
He held a gun to my head.
And he kissed me so hard that I...
That I tasted blood.
He forced himself on me.
And then he started to...
You don't have to say anything else...
No, you need to hear this.
I let him... do what he was doing.
And then when he dropped his guard...
I snapped his neck... with these two hands.
Then I wrapped his body in a shower curtain, and I buried him.
Now every time I cook breakfast in that kitchen,
I see his face.
I feel his breath on my neck.
And every lie I have to tell... no matter how much it costs me,
no matter how much it kills me inside, if I can be telling the truth when I tell my daughter that she is safe...
Every lie is worth it.
Every little bit of hope that I have... is here with you.
My future... is here with you...
If you want it.
You wanted to know who I am.
Well, now you see me... all of me.
Your move.
You have a family, Lieutenant?
I have a wife and two kids.
Do they know you're here?
My wife stopped asking me to talk to someone.
How long has she been asking you?
Ten years.
That's a long time.
So what happened ten years ago?
I lost my daughter.
I'm sorry.
You sold her ten Oxy pills.
She took nine.
And she died.
But here's what you don't know, is when my son was beating you half to death... he did you a favor.
He saved your life... 'cause I was waiting for you in your apartment.
If you knew who I was, why didn't you...
Why haven't I killed you yet?
My anger is the bridge that connects me to my daughter.
So, if I was to kill you, it would be letting go of my daughter.
If anybody comes to you and asks you about what happened...
I have nothing to tell them.
I never even saw the person who did this.
Now you have.
This is my son.
If anyone asks you about who did this to you...
I need a denial.
This wasn't the guy.

Then I guess our hour's up.
♪ Ain't no salvation here
♪ And the things they know
♪ Hope has flown away
♪ Here it goes
♪ Here it comes
Hell of a day.
Hell of a night.
Nobody's home.
I hadn't even knocked.
Why not?
I wasn't sure how to say what I need to say.
Well, you're in good company.
I spent half the day trying to figure that out.
So Quince won't be getting much sleep tonight?
No.
No, but the...
The streets of Brooklyn will get some rest.
Look away for one minute, and everything changes.
Open your eyes, and you see something for the first time.
Like her.
Her who?
Julia.
Bianchi... kept a recording.
What'd you hear?
I didn't see it.
I didn't want to see it.
But I covered Nate just in case.
Woz, what didn't you see?
She doesn't exist, the Julia I knew.
The assassination attempt, it was staged.
She knew it was gonna happen and the shooting at my house.
No.
No.
I mean, J...

She loves you.
So did you.
And now she's gonna be the mayor because "Julia wouldn't do that."
But I heard it.
I heard everything.
Does she know you know?
She will.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna forgive.
Before you even talk to her?
Not Julia.
She made choices to serve her ambition.
You made yours... to protect your little girl.
I'm sorry.
Sometimes... when everything's cracked... that's how the light gets in.
And it shows you the way out of the darkness, if you let it.
You think we can make it out?
I think we already have.
I know it's crazy, but... sometimes I feel like he's still out there... like Miguel is waiting to find me.
Where did you put his body?
You know that abandoned camp up 87... where we used to take Christina when she was little to look at the stars?
That's where I left him.
That place is too good for Miguel.
I didn't have a lot of time.
I couldn't remember a place so quiet.
