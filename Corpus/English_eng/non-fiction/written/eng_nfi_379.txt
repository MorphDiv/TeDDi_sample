Previously on "How To Get Away With Murder"...
- He died 'cause I left him there.

This is proof Mr. Lahey moved and hid the body from Miss Atwood.
I can fix this.

Are you kidding?

Atwood admitted she moved Wes' body.
Why aren't we talking about going after the people who killed Wes?
We don't know who killed him.
He testified against Charles Mahoney a week before he died.
Laurel.

Oliver:

You went to Annalise's house that night, didn't you?
1, 2, 3, 4.
Woman:

I say that to myself so that maybe I'll start to believe it [sighs] and feel bad.
Because I'll admit, right now,
I don't feel that bad.
It's like my brain just broke... all the way.
And I can't get that image of her out of my head.
Woman #2:

Cars crashing into a convenience store, and there's all these people trapped underneath.
They're screaming at me the most vile things that you've ever heard.
Woman:

"Pile of trash, You ugly whore."
- Mistake after stupid mistake.

- Why do I have to always be...

Worrying about everyone else?
- I just want to throw up.

- "dried-up, old bitch."

- I hate it.

It's just enough to make me want to die.
[Breathing heavily]

You sure?

I'm new.
But you already know that, so...
[Breathes deeply]
And I have a problem...

But I got other problems, too...
Lots of them.
Like, I could take up this entire meeting talking about them, and you would be entertained.
Trust me.
But everyone's got problems.
I mean, that's all you hear in these meetings...
Men who can't afford to eat, women who get beat up.
There was even a woman in here whose 6-year-old daughter died in a school shooting.
I mean, the world is ugly.
People get depressed, and so they drink.
That's clear.
But, I don't know.
Sitting in these rooms, talking about it...
I don't know.
[Groans lightly] It's just...
[Sighs]
I mean, look at you.
You've been coming here for 26 years, and y-you're still a mess.
I mean, what has coming here done for you?
I mean, tell me!
There's got to be something that you learned... something...
Right, that you helps you to feel better... other than this whining.
[Sniffles]
I mean, tell me.
Tell me what it is.
Man #2:

[Sniffles]
I'll think about it.
[Knock on door]
Oliver:

- [Panting] Running.

You'll be the one that benefits when I have abs.
Y-You left your phone.

I saw it was Bonnie, so I answered it.
There's a hearing for Annalise tomorrow to get her charges dropped, and they want you there.
[Sighs]
Maybe you should tell them.
They won't believe me.
Well, I believe you.
Do you?
Yeah.
That's convincing.
Why are you ignoring my texts?
I've been busy.
Busy ratting us out to the fuzz?
Would I be here if I did?
I don't know.

[Loudly] Copy that, officers?
I didn't go to the cops.
Did Oliver find something on Annalise's phone?
- Is that what you don't want to say?

- Then what's wrong?

- Why are you lying?

I brought you here to fill the seats behind Annalise, not to bicker.
Do I have anything to worry about?
Yeah.
Worry about wasting Annalise's time with this impossible motion to dismiss.
We win this, and all of our problems go away, including yours.
So get in there, sit down, and act like you actually like Annalise.
Bonnie:

Yes.
Why?
I forged a signature on the form ordering the transfer of Wesley Gibbins' body.
The signature of an investigator from your office...

Yes.
Can you explain to the court why you would tamper with evidence this way?
Objection... argumentative.
It's probative to the key issue of my motion...
Malicious prosecution.
Overruled.
I wasn't tampering with evidence.
I was protecting it.
How does transferring a body protect evidence?
Ms. Keating has a history of committing unlawful actions to win her cases.
I was trying to protect all of our evidence.
Now.
Transferring the body broke chain of custody, according to Rule 901.
Anyone, including you, could have manipulated the evidence.
But we will never be able to prove that, because after transferring the body, you also ordered its cremation.
- Isn't that true?

- Assuming facts not in evidence.

Bonnie.
[Scribbling]
As I'm sure you're aware, the Rule of Spoliation states that you may not benefit from the destruction of evidence.
I never meant to.
Intent is irrelevant.
Your Honor, who is trying the case here?
Ms. Keating, either act as your own counsel or advise your lawyer on your own time.
[Sighs]
Ms. Atwood, did you or did you not order the cremation of Wesley Gibbins' body?
I did not.
Do you know who ordered the cremation of Wesley Gibbins?
No.
- Because you're lying under oath?

Objection...

Jacobs:

No further questions.
Michaela:

- Of course.

We would've if I was the one asking the questions.
We go back in tomorrow, so everyone come back to my house, and we'll figure out ways to prove she lied.
Has anyone considered the possibility that Atwood has nothing to do with this?
Of course she does.
The Mahoneys killed Wes and got Atwood to help them cover it up.
- Why would she do that?

Money, son.
When you have Mahoney's cash, you can get people to do anything.
You can kill their pets, have sex with creepy, old guys.
- Annalise...

Uh, with my bank account in its current state, yeah, I would.
Laurel:

Charles Mahoney just got released from jail.
- [Camera shutters clicking]

Woman:

No.
Right now, I just want to go home, spend some time with my family.
Mrs. Mahoney, are you happy to put this all behind you?
Sylvia:

Man:

What'd I tell you?
They probably paid off a judge to get him released.
Shh!
My husband's murder is still unsolved.
So, while one nightmare might be over, we are still deep in the middle of another.
I owe it to my husband to find the person or persons who shot him dead in the middle of the street.
- Turn it off.

Great, so, we sit here and wait for her to come kill us, too.
She's not gonna kill us.
- She's gonna pay someone to kill us.

You said so yourself that these chuckleheads are dangerous.
But Atwood isn't.
She's the weak link.
And if we find proof that she had any contact with the Mahoneys, they all go down.
And isn't that what you want, to find out who killed Wes and how to make them pay?
So, that's what we do.
We don't stand around here complaining.
We act.
So let's get to work.
- You wanted to see me?

Denver:

Atwood?

I was there 'cause this is my case.
That the only reason?
'Cause this case has been damaged enough by my A.D.A. tampering with the victim's body.
- I had nothing to do with that.

But this whole department is under a microscope.
So I need you to look me in the eye and tell me that you are not in contact with Keating.
We've been done for a long time now.
I'm not here to play games, so either trust me or fire me.
No one's getting fired.
Good.
What's this?
Atwood's Wi-Fi password.
She works out of her home office sometimes, so if she had any secret communications, she'd do it from there.
You're welcome.
If Denver finds out that you're helping me,
- it could hurt both of us.

My ass could go to jail for the rest of my life.
It's my job to worry about everything right now.
Why do you think I'm here?
Say "thank you."
This is Atwood's Wi-Fi password.
Get into her computer, phone records, bank statements, anything that'll link her to the Mahoneys.
Well, you got her password.

The rest of you, dig into the discovery of my case...
Police records, interviews.
Chances are Atwood doctored some of those, too.
Oh, God.
That's not for you.
What is it?
It's a file that's better for Michaela.
I have no idea what you're doing.
No, no, no, please, don't.

He looks better than I thought.
You okay?
Yeah.
What's going on with you?
Nothing.
You can't even look me in the eye.
'Cause you're so blindingly beautiful.
You're mad at me for taking Asher's side.
Fine.

But I think the two of us know better than to let some boy ever come between us.
The only way I've gotten through any of this insanity is because we had each other's backs.
There's nothing you can't say to me.
I'm having coming-out flashbacks.
[Scoffs]
What is it?
I got into Atwood's landline records.
Okay, so, she received a call from this phone number on the night Wes died.
She got another call from that same number on the day that she had Wes' body moved and again on the night that he was cremated.
It's a blocked number.

Laurel:

Uh...

There's no way for me to find out whose number this is.
- Unless we call it.

Asher:

If the Mahoneys or one of their goons picked up, then we'd know they're in cahoots with Atwood.
Annalise:

Keep digging.

Um, I told you, I can't.
Oliver, now, you've done a lot of things this year you thought you couldn't do.
- They'll believe you.

What's going on?
- Nothing.

I'm just not feeling very well.
What happened?

- Asher.

You can be an ass to me all you want but not to my lady.
Asher, I think you're probably reading into things.
He's not.

- Just tell them.

Laurel:

Uh, I think we should just give Connor some space.
- Open your mouth.

You know, you're much nicer on HumpR.
That's 'cause I wanted to get laid.
[Chuckles]
You know what?
You're the problem with the gay community.
You know, we all just treat each other like a piece of meat.
We're all the problem with the gay community.
It was nice meeting you.
- [Door opens] - [Scoffs]
Hey, I realized I don't have my phone.
Could I borrow yours?
[Chuckles]
Wow.

[Cellphone beeps]
Annalise:

I need all of you to come to the house.
I got your voice-mail.
So I went to the house.
It was open.
Hello?

Annalise?
Connor:

That's where I found him.
Wes?
Wes!
Wes.

Come on.
Help!

He didn't have a pulse.
Or maybe I just couldn't find it.

But his body was still warm, so I started CPR.
- Why didn't you call 911?

- There was a phone in the house.

You don't understand.

[Gasps] I tried to save him.
Connor: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Breathe.
Come on, Wes!

He wouldn't breathe, so I-I kept doing the... the compressions.
But then...
[Bone cracks]
There was, like, a...

I don't know.

Maybe that's what killed him, you know, maybe, like, a... a bone punctured his lung or something.
No, no, Connor, h-he was hurt before you got there.
- Hey, do not baby him right now!

Did you see if he was hurt?
- No.

Because that would help us figure out how he died.
I didn't see anything!

Yeah, 'cause you left him there to die!
There was gas!

Whoever killed him cut the gas line.
- You mean you cut the gas line.

- Oh, God, Laurel.

How are we supposed to believe you right now?
Oliver:

Yeah, maybe 'cause he killed him.
Stop it.
Why are you just telling us this now?
Because he was afraid of this, that you would think he did it, when the truth is he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Yeah, maybe that's what he wants us to believe.
Will you stop attacking him, please?
All of you have done terrible things, and you have asked me to believe that you did them for the right reasons.
Well, now you need to do the same thing for Connor.
- Yeah, he hated Wes.

- You blamed him for everything!

- Please, Laurel, you're just making it worse!

So, you know what you need to do right now?
- You need to go and kill yourself.

That's the one good thing you're gonna do in your life.
You're gonna go, and you're gonna kill yourself, Connor!
[Gasps]
[Footsteps approach]
Today's a good day for you.
- [Door closes]

We're offering you a plea deal.
Admit Annalise ordered you to kill Wes, and you'll be out in seven years.
Your case against Annalise is in the toilet.
Maybe it's time you just give up.
If the judge throws out Annalise's case, my office is gonna have to come up with an alternative theory... like... you and Laurel Castillo killed Wes.
She was in the house that night, as were you, according to your confession.
Love triangle gone wrong.
What do you have on her?
Sign the deal, and no one ever has to know.
[Sighs]
Bonnie:

How?
By telling the police that she wasn't at the house that night.
[Sniffles] That doesn't mean she didn't do this.
Bonnie told you, right?
This whole time, I've been telling everyone that you killed Wes.
You should be begging her not to kill you right now, not attacking her.
Why don't you let her speak for herself?
So... was it you?
You killed him?
Leave, Bonnie.
Go.
Bonnie:

- [Door closes]

This is grief.
You're trying to make sense out of things that don't make sense, choosing a target for your anger.
- You still haven't answered my question.

I don't.
Every bad thing that we've done starts with you.
You're confused.
Or I just don't know how to bite my tongue anymore!
Laurel's right.

- You are.

- Neither have I!

Because of Wes, okay?

We were all trying to help him and you.
There you go again, deflecting.
No, no, no, you two dragged us into your Oedipal crap
- and we've all been trying to clean it up!

- I tried.

I was trying to protect him from you.
You couldn't stand the idea of spending one second alone.
You don't know anything about me.
Well, I know you're paranoid and broken, haven't trusted anyone since you were a little boy.
I know what you're trying to do right now.
And you're still acting like that little boy, making up ugly stories about people because you're scared of anyone actually getting to know you.
Oh, God, you're so desperate for that kid!
So you blame me for the mess that's been in your head since the day you were born!
All your sons are dead!
They're all dead!
And you can't use me to replace them.
Look me in the eye.
Right here.
You said you didn't hurt Wes.
So I believe you.
But I need you to believe me, too.
Forgive him.
No.
Annalise:

I don't care.

But it's not Connor's fault.
It's whoever killed him, and that's where your anger needs to be going right now.
Otherwise, this boy right here is gonna kill himself and we'll all have more blood on our hands.
Is that what you want?
Forgive him.
He had some big file on Laurel.
- He's bluffing.

He told you he's investigating all the kids, right?
To intimidate us.
Don't fall for it.
And don't do anything without talking to me.
Of course not.
Bonnie:

To buy a gun so that I can use it on Connor.
I have an OB appointment. [Sighs]
Still pregnant.
I really think that we should call the mystery number.
I can block my cell.

You heard Annalise.

[Tablet beeps]
[Engine starts]
Nate:

She parked in a garage in the Financial District.
- When?

Right after Charles Mahoney was released.
Hello?
Was that a thank you?
No.
When the judge asks me how I got the information, should I just tell them that you broke into her car?
I'm doing everything I can, Annalise.
- No, you're not.

[Sighs]
You should just talk to her.
You think she's gonna confess to me?
Well, she fell for your moves before.
Or are you not as charming as you used to be?
Okay.

Was that Nate?
We need all the help we can get.
Wait.
What if Connor isn't telling us everything?
[Sighs]
Is there really no vodka in the house?
No.
[Sighs]
Dr. Huang:

That thicker area there is the fetal pole.
And... there you are.
The heartbeat.
[Heart beating]
[Monitor clicks]
It's a big decision.
[Scoffs] Yeah.
[Sighs] How much time do I have?
Pennsylvania allows abortions up until 24 weeks.
Just know the law requires you to have a consultation with counselors where all your options are laid on the table
24 hours prior to the termination.
Right.
Meggy.
Hey.
Hey.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I just, uh...
I came to a doctor's appointment.
Being back here made me think of you.
Really?
Because I thought that we weren't friends.
[Sighs] Meggy...
Do you know that Michaela and them wouldn't even talk to me at Wes' memorial?
That wasn't about you.
They were just really worried about how I lost my mind up there on the altar.
I'm sorry.
I just...

It's just this whole situation's made me really paranoid.
Of me?
[Scoffs]
Of everyone.
Forgive me?
The bitch is spotless.
We've been through every file we have on Atwood... twice.
There's nothing that makes her look stupid.
I couldn't track the phone number, either.
- Sorry.

It says, "Stop being a weenie and call the mystery number"!
We're not calling the number.
What about asking your dad?
No.
I have an idea.
There's nothing in Wes' autopsy about the cracked rib, so you can put me on the stand, and I'll tell the truth.
It'll prove that the M.E. lied in her report and invalidate the D.A.'s entire case.
That could make Denver think you killed Wes.
Yeah, but it'll get Annalise off.
Okay, I know you think you have to do this, but...
I want to.
There's no other way.
You have to let me do this.
I can't let you take the stand.
Thank God.
But Laurel can, though.
Mr. Gibbins' blood test showed an abnormally high CO2 level, and I observed petechiae, which are small hemorrhages around his cornea and on the lining of his larynx.
The presence of those two factors led me to conclude that Mr. Gibbins' cause of death was asphyxiation by smoke inhalation.
Bonnie:

No.
Really?
Nothing that would result from a struggle or a fall?
Objection...

Merely asking the witness to clarify, Your Honor.
Apart from the third-degree burns sustained postmortem,
I observed no other traumatic injuries.
No further questions.
Jacobs:

Nothing from our side, Your Honor.
Great, that was the last witness on your list.
Correct, Ms. Winterbottom?
Actually, we have a new witness we'd like to call to the stand.
She was the other victim in the fire...

Objection...

New evidence about that night has come to Ms. Castillo's recollection.
The State objects, Your Honor.
I've had no time to prepare a cross.
Mr. Denver has just stated that she is a critical witness to the State, which means he should be prepared to question her.
I'll be prepared for the trial.
The point of this hearing is to determine whether there will even be a trial, Mr. Denver.
Please step up, Ms. Castillo.
[Birds chirping]
[Sighs] Why are you here?
You know why.
Tell me or I'll call 911 right now.
How long have the Mahoneys been paying you off?
The Mahoneys?
Then who asked you to cremate Wes' body?
I didn't order his body cremated.
We're not in court anymore.

Everything I said under oath was true.
You don't believe me, I don't care.
Nate:

You're following me now?
I didn't say that.
I had a job interview with Anthony and Levin to try and salvage what's left of my career after Annalise destroyed it.
You destroyed your career the minute you forged my signature.
And I have been kicking myself about that ever since.
I don't need you kicking me, too.
You wouldn't be in this mess unless someone was twisting your arm.
I told you...

Someone's gonna find out the truth.
And they might not be as understanding as me.
You're looking out for yourself.
So am I.
Don't come here again.
Why did you contact the defense today, Ms. Castillo?
Laurel:

Who did you lie to?
The police.
Bonnie:

Because I didn't know who I could trust.
But now that I know that the D.A. hid Wes' body,
I know that I was right.
What were you too afraid to tell the police?
That I saw Wes... in the house before the fire.
[Voice breaking] He was in the basement.

But his body was still warm, so I-I started CPR.
For how long?
A minute or more.
And I kept wanting to get him to breathe, so I just kept pressing on his chest.
Um... [Sighs]
But then, I must've...

What you're describing is a rib fracture, Ms. Castillo.
But the medical examiner testified that there were no other injuries.
That's a lie.
- Motion to strike.

Why are you hiding that?
Jacobs:

Why are you concealing how he died?

Unless you want to be held in contempt, Ms. Castillo,
I'm advising you to calm down.
[Sniffles] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
[Breathes deeply]
No further questions.
You're a law student, Ms. Castillo, so I assume that means you can define "perjury" for the court?
[Sighs, sniffles]
Perjury is the crime of lying under oath.
Very good.
Did you learn that at Middleton, or have you committed perjury before?
I'm not lying.
Really?
So, you've never lied to legal authorities before?
Hmm.
[Sniffles]
Well, answer the question.
Denver:

Objection, Your Honor.
On what grounds, Mr. Delfino?
Um...
I object, Your Honor, on the grounds of hearsay.
The D.A. is referring to a supposed out-of-court statement of which we have no proof.
Here's the proof, Your Honor.
The prosecution enters into evidence this affidavit from the Federal District of Mexico City.
It contains a statement from Ms. Castillo confessing that she made a false claim of kidnapping as a teenager.
Objection, Your Honor.
The D.A. is presenting improper character evidence.
Ms. Castillo, is this your signature on this statement?
Hm.
[Sniffles] It is.
[Sighs]
Jacobs:

Continue.
Denver:

I can explain.
I'm not asking for an explanation,
- just a yes or no.

Did you or did you not sign that document admitting that you lied to authorities about getting kidnapped?
Answer the question.
I did.
[Spectators murmur]
- So, you're a pathological liar?

Really?

- that well on the stand.

I lied about seeing Wes, not about being kidnapped.
You signed an affidavit admitting you made the whole thing up.

- I'm so confused.

I was really kidnapped.
I just had to say I wasn't in order to protect my father.
Right.
The defense requested this hearing with the intention of proving malicious prosecution.
The only thing they've been able to prove is to what extraordinary...

Now, although the cremation of the victim's body was an egregious clerical error, the official autopsy results prove that the fire was the cause of death...
A fire started by Ms. Keating in her own home.
And the only person to refute the findings was one of her own students who we now know has a history of perjury.
And let's not forget the evidence against Ms. Keating, that Mr. Gibbins was about to take an immunity deal incriminating her.
Ms. Keating instructed Mr. Gibbins to go to her house hours before he was killed.
Then she erased her cellphone?
We even have an anonymous source who's willing to testify as to her motives.
Whose identity is still being hidden from us.
We will reveal the identity as we get closer to the trial.
Either way, this case deserves to go before a jury.
At the very least, we owe that to Mr. Gibbins.
Jacobs:

Your Honor, I urge you to take more time with the facts of this hearing.
More time won't change my decision.
While it's true that A.D.A. Atwood engaged in heinous misconduct, it doesn't cancel out the abundance of evidence against Ms. Keating.
Defense's motion to dismiss is denied.
[Gavel bangs]
[Spectators murmur]
Well, that was a big waste of time.
You think?
[Handcuffs click]
I'm sorry.
[Knock on door]
Not now, Janice.
[Door opens]
It's not Janice.
Why are you here, Mr. Walsh?
I want Wes' immunity deal.
- Connor?

Or he just finally went to Russia.
Okay, you do not still get to be mad at him.
Oh, I get to be mad at him for the rest of my life.
- He's not in there.

Please don't do this.

Please.

- Hey.

- Where the hell is he?

Denver's office.
What?
I'll file for bifurcation from Frank first thing tomorrow.
Wait for me in your car.
Tell him he has to get out of there!
God!

Don't worry.

How?
By telling the truth...

No, Connor...
It's the least I can do at this point.
No, it's the dumbest thing you can do at this point.
All he's gonna do is think that you're lying...
O-or worse, that you're a suspect!
Don't worry.

He's having it drafted right now.
So, he's not there?
- No.

We all get it now, that you feel bad, even Laurel.
Say you're not mad at him.

So, please, Connor, just come home!
