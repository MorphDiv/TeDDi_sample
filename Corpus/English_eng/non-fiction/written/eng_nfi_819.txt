You look tired.
I've had better days.
The perils of a double life.
Updated estimates.
Sorry, they'll need to be added to tomorrow's charts.
Wonderful.
Don't work too late.
Transatlantic convoys... departure dates.
There doesn't seem to be anything for arrivals.
Well he's a cocktail waiter.
He can only do so much.
Then perhaps you need to move up the food chain.
I trust my efforts will be reflected in my fee.
You're not a man complicated by ideology, Mr. D'Aberville.
I know I have to go back to work, but you should be resting.
I'm supposed to be presenting to his aide-de-camp tomorrow morning.
So I doubt even a direct hit would cut it as an excuse.
I'll have some coffee sent up then.
Come.
I'm starting to think I might be quite lucky.
I should have consulted you.
It's a big event, the biggest we've ever had,
Her Ladyship's waiting for you in the bar.
Excellent.
You have something for me, Mr. Joshi?
I obtained the rest of those figures.
No, you're not.
And please remember I like my service with a smile.
Smile.
Thank you.
Bloody things.
Just like Cinderella.
Hardly.
I insist.
The lady said she's fine.
Of course.
Enjoy your evening.
"The lady says she's fine."
I've packed your sandwiches.
Peggy feels it isn't safe here any more, especially after Billy.
You have to be a big girl.
And for Billy.
Come on now.
Wave bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Nah, she doesn't want me sticking my nose in.
Mr. Feldman.
No, you... you do it...
It's Chertsey.
That's not so far.
Seems a long way to me.
They said it couldn't be done, but he proved them wrong.
The first US president to be elected to a third term.
And yet here in London there is still little cause for celebration... as Roosevelt vows... not to send any American boys into foreign wars.
I asked one hard-working English woman what she thought of the President and she said...
Erm, he seems like a nice man?
She said... that she hoped the President could hear her prayers from all the way across the water.
It's called artistic licence.
It's called making things up.
Well, I've been put in charge of the Halcyon's Golden Anniversary party and I wanted to run my ideas past someone before I present them to Lady Hamilton.
And as I work in the entertainment industry...
Well, as you spend most of your time in bars but... that works too.
I'd ask you to discuss it over dinner and drinks but I know what your answer to that one will be.
Yes.
But you're saying yes.
No.
Yes is good.
We can work with yes.
Good morning.
How may I help you?
Maybe they're going to give you a promotion?
I'm just presenting facts and figures.
Doesn't mean they can't promote you at the same time.
If they do promote you, you can get yourself a decent suit.
I apologise for the interruption, Lady Hamilton.
This gentleman would like a word with Mr. Hamilton.
Hello.
Right, OK, let me just...
He has a warrant from Special Branch to have Toby's room searched.
Has something happened to my brother?
It's not about your brother, Mr. Hamilton, just you.
Wait!
They have a warrant, there's nothing we can do.
They must stop...
I appreciate it's difficult but if you do hear anything...
Mortimer, yes.
Thank you.
You're the band leader, aren't you?
Sorry to ask, it's just um, you boys all look a little alike to me.
If you say so.
Tell me, what's the situation between you and that delightful young singer?
We're friends.
You seemed a little more than friends.
With all due respect, that is our business and no-one else's.
With all due respect, we let you come here, to England, and you're pawing away at our women.
There's no respect there at all, is there?
If you'll excuse me, I need to get to work.
My God, they put a suit on an ape and it thinks it's better than us.
Argh!
No, I swear.
Do you understand?
Good.
Good boy.
You know, they once tried to shut down the coffeehouses in London.
Long time ago.
An educated man.
Then I suppose you know why they wanted to close them.
They were seen as... gathering places for potentially subversive activity.
"Potentially subversive activity."
Very well put.
We've discovered some information has been leaked from the Admiralty, information that could only have come from your department.
It could have led to the destruction of many of our key ships in the Atlantic.
Surely you don't think I had anything to do with it?
It's a small department.
Were you close to your father?
No.
You understand why I'm asking you that though... given his Nazi sympathies.
Yes.
Five people in your department and one of them has leaked the information.
So, take a few minutes.
Think hard on who that might be.
Well, I've heard of it.
I am starting to regret saying yes.
Freddie.
My contact told me...
So as far as we know they've taken him to the interrogation centre at Latchmere House.
With all due respect, Mr. Garland, it's a family matter.
What it is is an insult.
I need a drink.
He'll always have this cloud of suspicion hanging over him.
He'd be effectively ruined.
He won't be the only one they're questioning.
The advice is appreciated but my decision has been made.
At least your father had some backbone!
Do you recognise these?
Documents about troop movements found in your briefcase.
In your hotel room.
We have a lot to get through, some people take work home.
Isn't that against the rules?
Officially yes, but it's understood if we're up against it...
When I'm not in my room, they're locked away.
Go on.
I am not some snivelling manservant of yours.
Someone is leaking information to Germany.
I don't think you realise just how much trouble these papers put you in.
That is concerning.
I'm sure it's all just a misunderstanding.
Thank you, Mr. Joshi, that will be all.
Thank you.
Mr. O'Hara, this is a private residence.
Well the door was open.
Well, you can close it on your way out, please.
Toby got pinched over leaks from his Admiralty department, right?
Toby's a friend.
You can trust Mr. O'Hara, Freddie.
It turns out it's not as simple as we thought.
I've just learnt they found confidential papers in his room.
You don't think he was...
No, he'd have brought them home to work on.
But they can call it evidence.
And that changes everything.
It must be your people who were caught out.
And now I need to plan my exit route.
Documents for safe passage.
There are ways to leave quietly.
Not without money.
What is it you want me to do?
While the Americans won't want to get physically involved, we believe Roosevelt may send armaments across the Atlantic as aid.
This is well beyond what we agreed.
Information like that would be worth a lot, Mr. D'Aberville, enough to help a man disappear, whatever his circumstances.
There are good ways to leave... or there are bad.
The choice is yours.
Mr. Garland.
I have a very serious complaint about one of your staff.
It doesn't matter that you think he's innocent.
Of course that matters.
Nobody cares what you think.
Well that's good because I think this conversation is a waste of time.
Just... hear me out.
Whoever you speak to will want to know why they should care.
Here's why Toby's arrest is bad for you.
And it would be bad for them because...?
Freddie?
We're talking about interfering in state security.
I get that, but your country's at war.
Justice and due process don't always win out.
And history is full of men who swung at the end of a rope for something they didn't do.
Mr. Sullivan.
Do you know why I'm here?
Mr. Wilson claims he and his friends were talking to you and you took offence at an innocent remark.
He wants you dismissed.
Now I'm of the opinion that a... humble and sincere apology will placate him.
He's returning this evening to have a few drinks and watch tonight's show.
I suggest you strongly reconsider your stance on this.
Try to put everything back in its place... as best you can.
Is his Lordship going to get him out?
Just clean the room.
Lord Hamilton.
Who would I speak to about having Toby released?
I strongly advise against it.
I appreciate that, but my mind is made up.
There is someone, but it may not go well.
Lord Ambrose.
He has influence.
He is also a close acquaintance of Brigadier Harker.
And Harker...
Is head of the Secret Service, yes.
And Lord Ambrose and my father were good friends?
For a while, yes.
They had a disagreement.
It concerned Lord Ambrose's... wife.
Well, that's just perfect!
Do you think he'd still be willing to meet with me?
I think he'd be curious to see what the new Lord Hamilton is like.
If you don't handle him correctly he has the power to make things a lot worse for Toby.
Have you got a girlfriend, Toby?
Nobody new in your life?
There's nobody.
You seem upset.
Toby.
If you're protecting someone... this is the one chance you get.
The one and only chance when I can help you.
So, I'm asking one more time.
We've only just started.
It always feels a bit strange... that despite everything that's happening elsewhere...
Life still goes on.
Yeah, well, what are they going to do?
Lock the door and hibernate?
Do you regret staying here?
No, I'm not a fan of regrets.
Now I didn't say that.
When I first met you I didn't think you had a sense of humour.
So it's just insulting in your head, then?
Honestly?
I didn't think you'd last.
Not once things changed.
Well, some things are worth staying around for.
But I assure you it is temporary.
And if you do need a torch, you can get one from Mr. Reynolds.
I'm going to throw a drink over him, glass and all.
Exactly.
You can't do that.
I want you to stay out of this.
Are you going to apologise?
He won't be the last person who has a problem with us.
I'm not going to spend my whole life saying sorry when I've done nothing wrong.
You?
If they sack you, I'm walking out... right by your side.
You really care about the place, don't you?
I know it's just a job and a hotel.
But it's home as well.
And after what happened, I...
Part of you wishes you were there... make sure Toby's OK.
Yes.
But part of me wants to be here too.
One more drink and then we'll go.
One or two more drinks.
I don't know.
Billy was in charge of it.
I see.
If I hadn't encouraged him to go and play soldiers
If I hadn't he wouldn't have been in the park and...
Have you been ignoring Peggy?
No.
She doesn't think Billy's gone.
She keeps talking about him like he's still here.
And then... the other day... she was telling me about this widow, her son was in the Navy.
He was reported dead.
It was a... clerical error.
Of course she knows.
But knowing and believing aren't quite the same.
It's what Billy used to do.
Make you feel better... for a moment anyway.
Again?
Aye, he's a clever lad.
So, I hear that you might have some family problems.
Nobody betrays their country.
They all have their reason.
A brighter future, a better way.
Your father presumably had his own for seeking to... shake the hand of the Fuhrer.
My father only discussed appeasement as a way to prevent war.
I understand you and he had your differences.
Really?
What differences were they?
Do you believe I'm loyal to this country?
You wouldn't have the wings if you weren't and I hear you're an ace nearly twice over.
So, doesn't it seem strange that my brother would conspire against me?
Don't you see, this is an attack on people like you and me.
I'm not sure I follow.
You've seen how things have changed since the Great War.
Lloyd George deliberately targeted our families and estates for tax.
We were once respected, now we're barely tolerated.
There are even calls for the Lords to be disbanded.
That makes more sense.
Your father would have barked more.
I prefer your style... even if it is a little feminine.
I can get them to release him.
But I can't get them to stop investigating.
It's this kind of entitlement, Lord Hamilton, that creates enemies.
That's the real reason they'll turn against us.
You can go.
Thank you.
Turns out you have influential friends.
And, frankly, that makes me sick.
I haven't finished with this.
Someone leaked that information.
And you can't hide behind your family forever.
Now get out.
I think... he's very fond of himself.
But I also think he cares for mother.
Not just her status?
Well, can you ever remember seeing her this happy?
There was... one other thing.
What you said to me before, about staying away from Emma.
I would very much like your permission to speak with her.
To see if there's any way... she would consider me again.
I don't wish to see her hurt... ever again.
You understand that?
Very well.
I have to say... of all the things I thought you'd be, a gentleman wasn't one of them.
I do have my reputation to consider.
Well, I'm sure under that suave exterior beats a heart of solid... dirt.
I get that feeling.
Any regrets?
I'm not a fan of regrets, Mr. O'Hara.
I've not gone mad.
I don't actually think he's coming back.
I just er...
I wake up and everything feels so empty.
Something to hold onto and... it got bigger and bigger and...
Do you miss him?
Only you've hardly said a word to me since he died.
Er, I didn't think it was my place.
Because if you do miss him... it would mean the years of life I gave him... weren't a complete waste.
It will mean he made a difference.
And I can't tell you what it would mean... just to hear you say that.
I miss him a lot.
I um...
I wrote a... poem... for him, but...
It's not very good but er, I just...
Yeah, just...
My God.
It's terrible, Richard.
I mean, it's heartfelt but... when he said it wasn't very good I didn't think he meant it.
I'm sure it's not that...
Dear.
Aw.
Billy would have bloody loved that.
I just...
Thank you.
Mr. Hamilton, welcome home.
Thank you.
I understand it's not what you wanted but I couldn't let them treat you like that.
No, no, that's...
Thank you.
I think I just need to get to my room.
Um, Lucian says that mother wants us all to have dinner.
They're waiting in the suite.
Half an hour.
Have you reconsidered what we discussed?
I will have to deal with him myself.
So, you were bluffing?
I don't know exactly what happened out there, but I do know I believe you.
Mr. Hamilton would like you to bring up some coffee.
He's back home.
Mr. Wilson.
May I?
Do you know how many rooms there are... in this hotel?
And a great proportion of them are at the back,
I would like to apologise for my behaviour.
It was unprofessional and I... deeply regret it.
I just hope that you can find the decency to forgive me.
For I know you are a decent man.
A bottle on the house and we'll leave it at that.
I'll arrange that now, Mr. Wilson.
You said you wouldn't apologise.
Not for him, no.
I did it for you.
She sings as though her heart's breaking.
Do you know the best thing?
It's all an act.
She doesn't mean a word of it.
Nobody should be facing them on their own.
What about you?
Well, I have my squad...
And your family.
And, well, I'm still here.
The work is brutal.
And...
I thought it would be better not to inflict it on others.
But I think I was wrong, Em.
Lord Hamilton.
I am glad to hear that Toby's home.
Thank you, Mr. O'Hara.
I did have a few thoughts, if you wanted to go through them.
50 glorious years, right?
The party next week.
I presume you'll be there.
I think I will be, yes.
Good evening, Mr. O'Hara.
Come in.
I was worried about you.
How are you?
Tell me you didn't betray me.
Say it wasn't you.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, Toby.
Toby, I love you.
I was threatened, my family, I...
No, I asked you who.
Mr. D'Aberville.
And don't tell me what to do!
Toby, pl...
It means we can... talk freely.
Makes things so much easier.
You're already implicated, you and your disgusting little boyfriend.
Forget the shame you'll bring on your family.
I'm talking about treason, espionage, capital offences.
But you... you are going to help me.
I only need one more thing and then all of this will be over.
Come on, dinner's waiting.
And look who I found wandering in the corridor.
Toby!
We were so worried about you.
Have you said a big thank-you to your brother?
Shall we tell them?
I think we should.
I have an announcement.
That's wonderful news.
Thank you.
Yes, I look forward to being a part of this family.
