Previously on APB...
The Reeves TK421.
If you have an oil fire, it can do this.
Give me the 13th district to run.
I will upgrade the 13th to the best technology money can buy.
I'm here to make it possible with this.
It allows citizens to call in
GPS located crime reports.
You know those people you're trying to serve and protect?
They just became your partners.
You are bleeding money with this new little cop hobby.
We are here to drum up new business
- and increase revenue, period.

Remember the strategic partnership with MilliScan?
Those boring gray boxes find guns.
We could own privatized policing.
I mean, this is not some small Chicago experiment.
I mean, this could go global.
This could be a billion dollar business.
Every 15 seconds, an American home is broken into.
But with the innovations of Reeves Security, you don't need to live or work in fear anymore.
For both residential and corporate clients,
Reeves Security is always there, keeping you safe no matter where you go.
And now, for the first time ever,
Reeves Security is allowing subscribers to select their own levels of protection, working directly with police to customize patrols in your area.
Whether you need them or you just need peace of mind.
So, what do you think?
Do they all have to smile so much?
Oh, Gideon, this is everything that we talked about.
No, no, no, it's everything that you talked about.
Ah, the subscribers and levels of protection?
You can't make people pay to call the police.
All right, can we just skip this part?
We don't have time for it.
You have your annual shareholders meeting in two days.
So?

I go in and I give one of my classic speeches, shake a few hands, see everybody next year.
No, no, this is not of your TED Talks, where you can just "Gideon" your way through it.
You have to release your quarterly statements.
So, you can either show a $400 million write-down, or a billion dollar... new business.
It's just... when I started all this, I thought
I was making the world a better place for everybody, not just rich people like me.
Well, I knew you when you were just a scared, scrawny little freshman at MIT.
Everyone knew that you were smart, but I knew that there was more to you than just that.
Gideon, this... this is the fix to our problem.
One second.
_
They need me at a crime scene.

Yeah, sounds familiar.
Will you promise me that you will think about it?
If you promise to wear that... that thing with the leather and the straps.
Yeah, make it happen, and you can have anything you want.
Thank you for coming down, Mr. Reeves.
Hate to bother you, I know you had a big meeting today, but...
No, no, no.
... we got a real nasty situation here.
I need you to get on the horn with the mayor, see if you can get him to shut down the streets of the 13th.
Oh, time for a block party or...
I wish.

Well, not that I don't enjoy talking to the mayor, but wha... why am I talking to the mayor, exactly?
Aren't fires the fire department's problem?
It's not about the fire.

See that guy in the red flannel?
That's Andre Coates, leader of the Green Street Kings, one of the two biggest gangs in the 13th district.
- Who's the other?

They had a building torched in their hood two weeks ago.
Couple of 'em still in the hospital.
So, this is retaliation.
That body in the bag, that's one of Andre's boys.
So, yeah, I'd say that's a safe bet.
There's nothing safe about this situation.
We need to get out in front of it before someone else is hurt or killed.
Okay, but I... shutting down the district?
I don't like it, either, but we can't round up every banger in a day.
And as hot as this situation's getting, one day might be all we have.
These boys are out for blood.

All right, let's get some.
- Gideon, we can't go in there.

- Gideon...

- Oh, yeah.

We can't be here unless fire gives us the all-clear.
Relax.

What's this?
It performs a chemical analysis, telling us what was used to start the fire.
Well, it's acetone and petrolatum.
Basically nail polish remover and petroleum jelly.
That's great.
Can we get the molarity of the acetone before ignition?
- Yeah.

Gideon, we're supposed to figure out how to stop the fires, not start them.
That's exactly what we're doing.
- By doing a science project?

When the going gets tough, the smart work backwards.
If we can identify the accelerant, we could use our cars to sniff it out.
- Sniff it out?

So, it can actually detect minute measurements of TATP and TPH in the air.
Bomb stuff, they smell bomb stuff.
We're gonna me 'em smell fire stuff.
Can it sniff out a good Cuban restaurant, too?
I'm gonna work on that.
Then he hit me here, then he kicked me there, and then he held me down and hit me again, here, here and here.
And this was before or after your altercation on the dance floor?
After, but I told you, that was a misunderstanding.
- The bastard you should be arresting...

Yeah, you said that already.
I think we get the picture.
We'll look into it and let you know what we find.
That's it?
You'll look into it?
I was assaulted and I've been sitting here all morning, telling the same story.
Hey, I understand that you're upset.
But see everybody running around here?
There was a quadruple homicide last night and right now...
I'd like a copy of that report.
We'll send it to you when we finish writing it up.
Yeah.

We'll be in touch.
Follow me, please, sir.
Hey.
What you doing?
Saving us time.
That crap about the report?
Kid's just looking for a lawsuit.
What, you think he did that to his own face?
No.
I think the guy he was talking crap to did it, but he was too drunk to I.D. anyone, so he's going after the bar.
Yeah, but he said the bouncer attacked him.
Yeah, and see, that's my other problem.
I know the bouncer, he's a friend of mine.
Guy named Vic Evans, we served together.
And I'm not buying that Vic couldn't handle some entitled rich kid with a big mouth.
Yeah, well, you can't just throw out the report.
Might be nothing, but we still got to check it out.
I'm sorry, I know you're a genius and all, but I don't like this.
What are you talking about?
I got half the guys in the department driving around looking for fires and all we've found is some guys stripping paint.
Yeah, technically, that means it's... it's working.
Yeah, but I can lower the detection threshold a little bit.
I don't know anything about detection threshold, but we're running out of time.
I feel like we're one fire away from the whole district going up in flames.
It's a balance, okay?

But an active gang war is not the time to be working out the kinks.
I know, just give it a chance.
I promise you're gonna love this.
Ah, we got a hit.
Cobb and Reyes, on a residential street, outside Canaryville.
All right, let's go.
Squad, we got any idea which address it's coming from?
Not unless you can drive your Caddy into all those houses.
That's actually something I should be working on.
Looks like we're knocking.
CPD!
Can I help you?
Sorry, wrong address.
CPD, open up.
Yeah?
Never mind.

You smell that?
CPD!
CPD, open up!
- Squad, unless our firebug

I'd say this one is a miss, too.
All right, Murphy, that's it, I'm calling it.
It's time to start combing through the SSL, see who comes up.
Copy, Squad.
Sorry, Gideon.
Captain, Captain!
One more, one more, one more.
Murph, we got one more.

It's pretty weak.
Well, check out the building on the corner.
The chemical signature is a little bit different this time.
Is that supposed to mean something?
Uh, yeah, it might.
You want me to explain the science or can I just let her check it out?
Last one.
Murphy, it's coming from somewhere in the south side of the street.
Okay, I'll take a look.
Hey, check this out.
That's the Green Street Kings tag.
Make sure, Murphy.
I'm sick of false alarms.
Captain?
This is not a false alarm.
Fire!

Everybody out!
Gideon, I need backup.
Fire, police, everything.
All right, who can you get over there?
Cobb and Reyes, but they're not that close.
Fire department's on the way, three minutes out.
_
_
_
Se√±ora...
Okay?
Grab me that towel.
Okay?
It's okay, come on, follow me.
What the hell?
Hey, Murphy, head left.
We got your back.
Come on, come on.

Gideon, I can't see.

Uh, can you... can you put a digital filter on the body-cam?
Yeah, I can throw out the visual spectrum and I can turn on the IR.
Hug the right, there's a hot spot
- on the left side of the hall.

Come on, stay against the wall, okay?
Good, good, good.
Stay close.
You got it.
Move, move, move, move!
Move!
All right, I see a clearing.

Follow me, okay?
Good, you got it.

Yes.
Mima!
You got her?
Good?

Gracias, Adriana.
Hey.
Do you have anywhere to stay?
Do you have family around here?
No, they're all back in Honduras.
I'll figure something out.
Why don't you stay with me?
No, I'll be fine.

Argue with a police officer?
I got a guest room you can use until you get back on your feet.
Come on.
- Vic.

What's your ugly mug doing in here before 6:00, huh?
Hey, let's get this guy a beer, he's a buddy of mine.
- As much as I'd love to...

Yeah.

That happened here?
Yeah.

Of course.

It was just a regular day at the office.
Yeah, some college kid, he came in this morning with a busted-up face, said he got attacked on his way out of here.
- By who?

It's probably nothing, but, uh, the kid, he's talking a big game, like he wants to sue or something.
We just need to hear your side of the story.
You remember what happened?
Yeah, of course I do.
He's a frat boy, right?
Yeah.
He got rowdy on the dance floor.
He had tequila coming out of his ears.
He stepped on some girl's toe, got into it with her boyfriend.
So I had to show him the door.
I didn't attack anybody.
So you threw him out?
Yeah.

But this... this guy can't actually sue me, right?
Well, not if I got a say in it.
Do you have cameras in this place?
- Anything out front, maybe?

But troublemakers don't go out the front door.
The owner doesn't want 'em scaring away customers.
What about cameras out back?
They don't have any cameras by the rear exit.
Mind if we take a look?
Sure thing.

Look, I got a few more cases to stock.
Do your thing, Vic, we're all good.
Oh, we got some sick new flat-screens in the VIP room.
I'm not working tonight... you want to watch the Bulls game?
Uh... yeah, sounds fun.
Sounds fun?
What, you don't like free beer?
Would you just, like, relax a little bit, please?
There's nothing to investigate here.
It's just some rich drunk kid's word against Vic's, and I've known him for years.
And the guy got me through boot camp.
If it wasn't for him, I'd still be face down in a ditch.
Now let's go.
Okay, here you go.
This one's really soft.

- I'm sorry, I can't take it.

Go on, try it on.
You know what, I used to always dress my little brother up in my old clothes.
I always wanted a little sister.
- I have a little sister.

Yeah, back in Honduras.
I should have stayed there.
Why didn't you?
My mom got sick, so I came here to find work.
And for five months I sent money home.
When she died, I didn't even get to go to her funeral.
I was trying to make it here alone.
But then the fire took everything.
It just happened so fast.
Yeah, those old buildings, they burn pretty quick.
But I've never seen a fire move like that.
Hey, uh... can I ask you something?
Yeah.
Do you ever feel unsafe?
Like from you or...
That's funny.

Now I do.

Well, Lauren has an idea for how we can save the future of Reeves.
Ah.

By selling our police tech to civilians.
Private security, right?
There's a lot of money there.
Pricey condos and gated communities.
Yeah, that sounds awesome.

Or, you know, North Korea.
Can't exactly fund every district in the country.
Even billionaires don't have that kind of money.
Oh, my God.
You sound just like Lauren.
Man, it is crazy how quickly she gets in your head.
But by all means, you guys want to turn this world into a police state, that's fine with me.
Just don't ask for my help.
What does she think about all this?
Hasn't really come up.
- Huh.

Well, if you can't talk to Murphy about it, it's probably a really dumb idea.
We need to talk.
Sounds serious.
I've got a hunch.
Oh, how Scooby-Doo of you.

I can't explain it, but I can't shake this-this feeling that this isn't a real gang war.
I mean, if the Hustlas and Kings really wanted to kill each other, all it would take would be, like, some drive-bys.
Both of those gangs are armed to the teeth.
Why burn down a building full of immigrant families?
I just combed through the records, and before last month, there's never been any history of arson with either one of them.
Maybe they decided to turn up the heat.
See what I did there?
There's only one way to find out for sure.
- What's that?

There's always some kind of beef between us and the Hustlas, but killing grandmas, that ain't how we get down.
We want new turf, we need customers, not corpses.
Right.
Don't you think the Hustlas feel the same?
I don't give a damn how they feel.
You still think they set the fire that killed your boy?
- Probably not.

So you're not gonna hit back?
I didn't say all that.
I still got to do what I got to do.
You just said that they didn't do it.
I know what I said.
I'm a CEO, just like you.
End of the day, I got a bottom line.
Situation like this creates what you might call a leadership challenge.
I can't let my people see me taking, and not giving it back.
Andre, please, just hold off a day.
Okay?
Give us a chance.
What the hell you gonna do with a day?
Get the guy who really did this, and put his ass in jail.
Fine.
I'll tell my boys to chill, but you and Richie Rich over here... better hurry.
By the way, dinner's on you.
If this wasn't the Hustlas and the Kings, we're back at square one.
Or... and I'm just throwing this out there... maybe the career criminal was lying to us.
Andre knows he's better off telling me the truth.
If he says he didn't do it, he didn't do it.
But he's not gonna keep the peace for long unless we can figure out who did.
Anything else on the fire report?
No, no.

They had to come up with new ways to say "catastrophic."
Damn it.
How did those fires spread so quick?
I wish I could just go back in time and pay more attention when I was in there.
Go back in time to when you were there.
Murphy... you're a genius.
I'm-I'm...

Let's get back to the station.
I got an idea.
So I was able to use the footage from Murphy's body-cam, along with some that Ada pulled off her phone to reconstruct the fire in this 360-degree
- virtual view of what happened.

It's great.

Full-size?

Oh, yeah, I got to be able to walk around in it with Murphy.
I'm thinking, like, ten or 12 feet.
How big is this room?
Gideon, that's not gonna be cheap.
No.

When can you have it done?
Uh, four hours, I guess.
Cool, I'll be down there in two.
Good work.
Oh, come... come on!
What are you calling a foul?
Just let these guys play.
Ah, we never should have got rid of Noah.
Man, I still haven't gotten over Jordan.
Yeah.

Hey, uh, I've been meaning to ask you.
What do you think it would take for me to get on the force?
The force?

Why not?

You can vouch for me.
Plus, I figure, if they let you do it, anyone...
Ah, right, right.
Look, I just want to do something I'm proud of.
You know, bouncing's no way to make a living.
It's late night, crappy food, drunks in your friggin' face all the time.
You know that cops have all that, too, right?
Yeah, but you get decent pay and benefits.
Well, there's a lot more politics involved with it.
I mean, just getting a badge, you got to jump through all kinds of hoops.
My partner, she's got this friend at the personnel division, and they just straight deny applications all day long.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, she's got a friend in personnel?
Yeah.
Then call her, put in a word for me.
Oh, come on, man.
I-I just, I need a shot.
All right.
Yeah, I'll give her a call.
What, you want me to call her right now?
Yeah!

All right.
Hey.

Aah...
Ha, ha!
Wow, I mean,
I can't believe that Pete built this in one day.
It's pretty cool, right?
It's like being inside a KISS concert.
Oh, yeah.
Are you people ready to rock and...
You...
What?

Sorry, I'm not a hundred years old.
So is this everything from my body-cam?
Can you loop it back?
Stop.

Every time that I look at this, it just feels like the fire's coming out of nowhere.
What's that?
Take it back ten seconds.
Frame 455.
Pay attention to the ducts as we walk by.
That's how it spread so fast.
You can't get into those ducts without anyone seeing you.
Whoever did this, had access and knew exactly what they were doing.
So unless Chicago's gangs have gotten into the heating and air conditioning business...
We're looking in the wrong place.
Here's the problem, Gideon.
If we don't find this guy fast, then the Green Street Kings are gonna burn this district to the ground.
I'm sorry, Detective.
I don't understand what you mean.
We've been looking into a series of fires that've been going on in the 13th district, trying to find some kind of a link.
So what do you want with me?
Well, it turns out that your company has had jobs for every single one of those buildings that've been burned.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you suggesting I'm involved in this in some way?

No.

But we do think that someone that works for you might be.
So with your permission, we'd really like to look at your employment files.
No.

Why not?
Well, I'm not gonna be railroaded without a warrant.
- I know my rights.

You're a smart man.
How much?
How much for what?
All of it, Mr. Kim.

Oh, it's not for sale.
Well, maybe not, but I need your records.
So from a negotiation standpoint, you're in the catbird seat.
Does 300 grand cover it?
Wha...

I don't even know how much my business is worth.
Half a million.

Sold.
Here you go.
Uh... so, s-should I just go, then?
- Yeah.

Thanks.
Do we need that?
You're unbelievable.
I'd help, but I think you're better at this than me.
I think you're right.
You and your computer screens.
I mean, can you even read handwriting?
Come on, I bought all the files.
You expect me to read them, too?
Shh.
- Boom.

This guy, Duke Johnson.
He was the Lakefront H-VAC supervisor for both buildings.
I mean, if anybody can tell us about the guys that worked there, it's this guy.
But this file's ancient, though.
I mean, there's no address, there's no number.
It's gonna be impossible to track him this way.
How about that way?
Well, look at that.
You can read after all.
Hey, Cap, you got a sec?
Well, if I didn't, it doesn't matter now.
I wanted to talk to you about a new potential recruit.
Vic Evans.

Oh, good, good.
So you know he was a great soldier.
He's gonna make a great cop.
Not while he's the subject of an active investigation.
Active?
What do you mean?
Maybe you should talk to your partner.
Tell me you didn't poison the well for Vic.
I didn't poison anything.
Just not drinking this dude's Kool-Aid yet.
- Goss, you got to trust me.

- I also want to protect you.

Look, I know you think you owe Vic from helping you out back in the Army, but what if you get this guy on the force and he loses his cool on someone?
You really want to put your ass on the line for somebody you used to know?
Hey.

- He's not what you think.

Then I'm sure we won't find anything on this.
It's the alley behind your friend's bar, where he says he doesn't beat anyone up.
- Oh, hell no.

If he's really the angel you say he is, you have my word and I'll call the personnel division myself and recommend Vic for the academy.
But if I'm right, we arrest his ass and you buy my iced tea for the next six months.
You want me to spy on my friend?
No, Brandt.
I want you to back up your partner.
Look, it's not like I wanted to buy the place, Lauren.
It was just a means to an end.
Okay, well, the only end that you need to be worried about is convincing the shareholders that you are in control of Reeves.
I just finished with the board, and we have a meet-and-greet tonight at Gibson's.
Mm.

I-I don't think I can make that.
All right.

But listen, it is very important that you are prepared tomorrow.

Yeah.

What if I don't give a speech this year?
You could spin it as a good PR move.
Intrigue the shareholders.
You're nervous.

But just give the speech that I wrote.
You are gonna do great.
You good?
Yeah, I'm fine.
What do you think about privatized policing?
Like rent-a-cops?
Mm.

Like if people could pay for some of the stuff that the 13th District does now.
What, what, what?
People want more security.
I'm just supposed to ignore their money?
Gideon, the people who need our help the most can't pay for it.
There's this girl, Adriana, from the last building that burned.
She lost everything in that fire.
If we start protecting rich people from their shadows, who's gonna protect people like Adriana?
Fair point, yes.
But I do have a responsibility to my shareholders as Lauren reminds me twice a day.
Well, I'm one of those shareholders.
And I don't think it's a good idea.
What are you talking about?
I bought a couple shares in Reeves Industries.
Mateo's college fund.
So, do I want you to make money?

But not if it means selling my badge.
The job site's up here.
Okay.
If Duke can tell us who we're looking for, then we might beat Andre to the punch.
... And now they're telling us that we have to be some kind of sanctuary city?

We need to march on city hall and tell the mayor that Chicago is for Americans.
I've had enough of this liberal, multi...
Duke Johnson?
Yeah, that's me.
Detective Murphy, CPD.
Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?
... The immigrants come in...
Hey!
Stop!
Gideon, move!
Damn it!
It's okay.
It's just my ankle.
We lost him.
Well... not entirely.
Hey.
How's the foot?
It'd be better if you told me we got something out of that phone.
Well, then get ready for a miraculous recovery.
We checked the cell's location history.
Turns out Duke the Supervisor has been spending a lot of time in an old warehouse.
Yeah, it's a place he used to own in Fuller Park?
It's been abandoned since he filed for bankruptcy in '08.
Send the address to my car.
- I'm gonna check it out.

I can still kick ass with my good foot.
- I actually believe her.

This is a complete waste of time.
Yeah.

And told me I was full of crap at least twice.
Well, you know.

Shut up.
Uh... he's coming out again.
Come on, man.
Kicking me out over a little spilled drink?
You spilled three drinks on two girls, all right?
All right, you've had enough.

There.
Do you see that?
One more politely escorted drunk.
How much longer do we need to do this?
Yeah, what if I don't want to go?

What you gonna do then, bouncer boy?
Oh, damn it.
- Hey, hey.

Chicago Police.
Put him down, Vic!
Hey, Hey, hey, hey, hey, bud.
What the hell's wrong with you, man?

Squad, we need an ambulance.
Just stay still, just stay still...
Calm down, just calm down.
Got Murphy, Cobb and Reyes at the warehouse we found on Duke Johnson's phone.
Great, great, great.

Welcome to Hatefest.
What kind of sicko is this guy?
The kind that spells America with three "K" 's.
This bastard just wanted to hurt immigrants and let Andre and his boys take the heat.
Let's go see if we can find him.
Need more backup.
Yeah, especially with a Nazi firebug on the loose.
Freeze.

Drop the can and put your hands over your head.
Easy, chica.
This stuff's very flammable.
Do what I told you, you racist son of a bitch.
It's not a problem.
No problemo.
Squad, offender on the move and he set the damn place on fire.
Gideon, they need help.
Yeah, I can see that.
Let him go, Murph.
Just get out of there.
Squad, the offender's exiting from the east side of the building.
Reyes, they're headed your way.
Try and cut him off.
Chicago Police.
You're under arrest, you son of a bitch.
Well done, guys.
Offender's in custody.
Good, now let's get Murphy out of there.
Uh, guys?
Hang on, Murphy.
I'm coming.
Yeah, thanks.
Fire department's a ways out, at least another eight, ten minutes.
I'll be there in two, tops.
What the hell's a drone gonna do?
This is not an ordinary drone.
This is the TK421.
This one uses a concussive charge to extinguish flames.
You're gonna blow up the fire?
Murph.

Short, shallow breaths.
There's no way back in.
Which means there's no way back out.
Okay, drone's on site.
Talk to me, Ada.
There's got to be some way to get inside.
There's an opening in the roof on the east wall.
Okay.

I don't know.

It's gonna be pretty difficult.
Well, I do love a challenge.
- Murph, you still with me?

I don't know how much longer.
Murph,
I'm gonna clear a path for you and you're gonna run, okay?
Okay, okay.
Murph, one more thing.
This could get a little loud.
Go now!
You got this, Murph.

Almost there.
Go!
Hey, hey.

She's out!
Thank God.
And me.
And-and God.
Hey, bro.
Hey.
Sorry about last night.
Just got a little amped up.
Why don't you just let me go home and sleep it off?
I can't do that, Vic.
You lied to us.
Someone comes at me, I just suddenly... black out.
Yeah, well, um... now, listen, I'll, uh...
I'll talk to the prosecutor.
I'll see if he'll consider your service record.
See about getting you some real help.
Brando.
Thanks, brother.
You talk to him?
Yeah.
Sorry I was such a jerk.
Listen, I know he's your buddy, and...
Yeah, but you're my partner.
Next time I'll listen.
Needs more sugar.
In light of Johnson's arrest, the gang conflict that has plagued the 13th district is rumored to be nearing a truce.
Leaders from both sides...
I hate the way I look on TV.
You looked amazing.
I can't believe you actually caught him.
Well, it takes a special kind of crazy to do that job.
I was thinking... maybe I'd like to be that kind of crazy.
You want to be a cop?
Do you think I could do it?
Yeah, I think you can do anything you want to do.
Shoot, I'm late.
Um, do you mind waiting until Mateo and Mita come back from the store?
She's an awesome cook.
Don't worry.

Okay, good.
As you all know,
I have solved a lot of tough problems in my life.
Reusable rocket stages, asteroid hunting telescopes, you name it, but, uh, you know what?
I never faced a problem tougher than law enforcement.
In engineering, math, problems have solutions.
Once you figure them out, you're done.
You're ready for a new challenge.
But as long as one person in the world still wants to take unfair advantage of another, there's no real solution to crime.
Now, fortunately, a problem being unsolvable does not mean that it can't make money, which is why in the next fiscal quarter,
Reeves Industries will proudly introduce...
APB Prime.
Bravo!
This revolutionary approach... to privatized policing... will offer Reeves customers... a new level of personal security... on a pay-as-you-go... or subscription basis.
So, uh, whether we are working in tandem... with local law enforcement... or offering our services √† la carte... to an elite clientele... um... yeah, we're not doing any of that.

Here's the deal.
I started this company from a South Side storage space and turned it into the global powerhouse that it is today.
Seven divisions, 28,000 employees, 48 billion in the bank, and I used to think that making those numbers bigger was all that mattered.
But in the last few months,
I've looked at some new numbers.
3,248 shootings.
564 homicides.
14 cases of deadly arson.
That's just Chicago.
So, all that matters to me now is making those numbers smaller... no matter what the cost.
Listen...
I've made each and every one of you folks a crap-load of money.
So, like it or not, you're just gonna have to trust me on this one.
Gideon out.
