So many years,
So many memories.
She was very, very beautiful.
And he was a very.
Beautiful baby.
It's sort.
Of like a landmine.
In the mind, you know.
"I wonder what they're doing."
Monnheimer:
I just wanted my mom.
I was angry that the adults.
In my life.
Were not solving this for me.
Had it been in my power,
I would have, you know,
And shaken it to try.
To find charlotte and marx.
With this case.
After 30plus years.
I couldn't believe.
That this story.
Could take a turn.
And just blow up.
I never saw it coming.

Captions paid for by.
Discovery communications
Everything seemed.
To be going great.
Charlotte seemed to be.
Very happy.
I was sort working into.
The position of being a father.
And all that good stuff.
I mean, everything was great.
It really was.
Lives on the island of oahu.
With his 31yearold girlfriend,
Charlotte moriarty,
And their.
Sixmonthold son, marx.
The couple plans to spend.
The day working on the house.
Where they'd been living.
Rentfree in exchange.
For maintaining the property.
So I had had built.
A deck.
And we were planting birds.
Of paradise on the corners.
To kapula's.
To pick some stuff up.
Charlotte said she was going.
Down to the little store.
That was three blocks away,
And that she'd be back shortly.
I'll take marx with me.
So I said, "Fine, great",
See ya soon."
Several hours go by,
But charlotte and marx.
Don't come back.
I walked down.
To the little store,
But they were not there.
Instead,
He finds marx's stroller.
Abandoned at a bus stop.
I figure she got on a.
Bus, so I took the stroller.
And walked home,
Figuring she had gone somewhere.
And...
I waited.
That evening,
There's still no sign.
Of charlotte and marx.
Mark wonders if maybe
Charlotte took a bus.
To see one of her girlfriends.
On another part of the island.
She would go.
And see people, and, you know,
Sometimes not come back.
For two or three days.
She had a baby bag with bottles.
And everything in it,
So, no, I was not.
Overly concerned.
Charlotte was just sort of.
Living for the day,
Which was pretty much the way.
It was in the '70s.
In 1976, mark is.
A freelance writer.
From california.
Who landed on oahu.
After a tour in vietnam.
With the navy.
I was pretty much living.
By myself, you know,
And ends and write.
One evening, I was writing,
And charlotte arrives.
With a gentleman.
They were lost.
Asked for directions.
Mile down the road,
Right hand side.
So it's around.
You can't miss it.
And then the next morning,
I'm up, and who's.
At the front door,
But charlotte.
Hi.
She'd evidently.
Lost her gentleman.
She was alone, and she wanted.
To see the island.
What are you doing today?
So I volunteered.
To take her around.
The connection between
Mark and charlotte is instant.
Whoo!
She was a very free spirit,
Very smart.
Very beautiful.
She had a great sense of humor.
And when she wanted.
To something, she did it.
Mark and charlotte.
Were antiestablishment.
I mean, that was part of.
Their attraction to each other.
They moved in together.
Up the hill from me,
And so they were neighbors,
And a happy couple.
They were both kind.
Of nuts, you know.
Frivolous and happy.
It was a great combination.
Charlotte tells mark.
She was previously married.
And has a 7yearold daughter.
Who lives with her.
Father in new mexico.
My mother was.
A very deep thinker.
She was a searcher,
I think even before it.
Became a little bit popular.
She definitely was raised.
With sort of.
An uppermiddleclass lifestyle.
I think the expectation for her.
Was that she would marry well,
And she did.
But she wanted something.
A little bit more free,
A little bit more bohemian.
My dad tried very hard.
To make her happy, and...
It wasn't enough for her.
And they split up.
So I ended up.
Living with my dad.
And my mom was very much in.
And out of my life.
At that point,
But I was always happy.
To see her, you know.
And I'll never forget it.
It was just... 'cause I didn't see her.
We went to the woods,
And we discovered.
A little butterfly larva,
And we took it home.
We put it in a jar, and we.
Just watched it over time.
And it was incredible.
I can see that that was.
Kind of symbolic of.
Where she was.
At that time in her life.
She was changing,
She was transforming.
Into something else.
In 1976,
Charlotte moves to hawaii.
Soon after meeting mark barnes,
She becomes pregnant.
With their son marx.
I was sort of shocked.
I wasn't ready to be a parent,
But, you know,
You're never ready.
For that sort of thing.
So I embraced it, and said,
"Well, you know, let's do it."
And we did.
I remember that he was.
Pretty stunned about it.
It's a lifechanging event.
But he was stoked,
As we would say,
And very proud.
We loved.
That little boy.
We were having a great time.
And living the hawaiian life,
And charlotte seemed.
To be very happy.
And everything was just.
Rolling along very smoothly.
For two days, mark.
Continues to work on the house.
And waits for charlotte.
And marx to come home,
But they never do.
I became.
A little worried.
So next day, I called.
The honolulu police.
According to mark,
He tells police that
Charlotte is a free spirit.
On a whim and doesn't call.
So I said, "Fine."
Then after several days,
I called again and said,
"My wife is missing.
With my child."
They took down a description.
And everything,
And, if I recall,
They never sent anybody.
To the house.
But after almost.
Three weeks pass,
Charlotte and marx.
Still haven't surfaced.
At that point,
I was really worried.
I hadn't seen my son,
Hadn't seen charlotte.
Don't know what.
The hell happened.
Around this time, mark.
Learns that his good friend,
Charlotte with marx a few days.
After she went missing.
Walking along a busy road.
I was driving.
To honolulu,
And the kid was over.
Her shoulder.
Couldn't stop.
Because it's miles away.
From anything else.
When he told me that,
I was surprised.
Because I couldn't imagine.
Why she had gone to honolulu.
Unless to pick up.
Something or there.
I just had this feeling like,
You know, what is she up to now?
To see what the progress was,
And I discovered.
That they had no record.
Of any phone calls
I had made reporting her,
They had no record.
Of a missing person,
They had no record at all.
Sundquistdecaires:
On july the 10th of 1977,
To initiate a missing.
Persons case.
For charlotte and for his son.
That he had seen her was.
On june 21st at 9:00.
At a residence.
It was mentioned in the report.
That charlotte had.
Taken off prior.
And returned prior,
So that was a known factor.
In regards to this case.
Psychological state of mind.
I said she was, you know,
A free spirit.
She did what
Charlotte wanted to do.
When charlotte wanted to do it.
I was fairly desperate.
To have them do anything...
Move in any direction.
As far as finding her and marx.
According to mark,
Charlotte seemed happy.
On the morning she went missing.
Great, see ya soon.
Her behavior had alarmed him.
It was a very crazy.
Period of time.
When charlotte came back.
With a baby from the hospital.
For a week to 10 days,
She walked around the house.
With a blindfold on.
So she couldn't see.
I was doing most.
Of the heavy lifting.
I was in charge of the baby.
And taking care.
Of the diapers,
And, eventually,
She took off the blindfold.
And she seemed to be.
A very doting mother.
Mark assumes
Charlotte had suffered.
From postpartum depression.
And some who know her would say.
She is prone to mood swings.
Bouts of going in and out.
She wanted to be alone a lot.
I never noticed anything that.
Was radically wrong or anything,
But she would go off.
Sometimes all by herself.
And, you know,
Disappear for...
I don't know how long.
Charlotte has ever.
Stayed away from mark.
Her daughter, Jennifer,
Has a theory about what may have.
Triggered her disappearance.
The last time I saw.
My mom was in santa fe.
She was four months pregnant.
It was wonderful for me.
To see her.
I didn't...
I didn't want her to go.
I remember she put her.
Hand on her belly,
And she put my hand.
On her belly, and...
You know, it was just powerful.
I'll never forget that.
She said that she would.
Come back at thanksgiving,
And then we took her.
To the bus stop.
That was it.
After marx is born,
Charlotte starts making plans.
For Jennifer to come to hawaii.
To meet her new brother.
My father was working with my.
Mother's father and my mother.
They were trying to organize a.
Time for me to come out to visit.
In july of 1977.
But a few weeks before
Jennifer is supposed to arrive,
The plan falls apart.
My dad was very.
Protective and concerned.
During the '70s, it was hard.
If there was a separation.
Or a divorce.
Sometimes it could be hard.
To get that child back.
So my dad was worried that I may.
Not be sent back from hawaii,
That my mother would keep me.
In hawaii with her.
I think that,
When I did not come,
My mother fell apart.
That's the sense that I get.
It was the last straw.
I think she just spiraled.
After mark files.
A report, honolulu police issue.
An official.
Missing persons advisory.
Sundquistdecaires:
They check with friends,
Family members,
Check for the hospitals,
To see if there was anyone.
That might be there.
They took down.
A description and everything,
And "Thank you very much",
And give us a call.
"If she comes back."
I don't think they were overly.
Concerned about it.
I mean, people would go off.
With someone else,
That sort of behavior.
Was sort of rampant.
During the time we were there.
She just disappeared.
Lots of people did that.
In those days.
And on an island like hawaii,
And with her background,
I think that she could.
Have made a phone call.
And got a plane ticket.
And just left.
I mean, that happened.
All the time.
After a brief mention.
In the local news,
The case goes quiet.
Mark continues.
The search on his own.
Well, I hitchhike.
Up and down the north shore,
You know, stopping.
At all the beaches.
And everything.
And I look around...
With no luck whatsoever.
I mean, I did everything I could.
In my power to try to find her.
But I think my dad pulled me.
Into a room, shut the door,
And told me that my mom.
Was missing,
And nobody knew where she was.
I remember just being so sad.
I was just so wanting to meet.
My new halfbrother,
And I was on the swing...
There were two swings...
And I would kind of swing.
The other swing.
And, you know, we were.
Just sharing, like siblings.
I really wanted to know him.
But I...
I just knew that, you know,
They were gone.
For years,
Everyone assumes
Charlotte chose to leave,
Taking marx with her.
But a new lead.
Is about to surface,
Suggesting a much darker answer.
To the mystery.
We started knocking.
On neighbors' doors...
Can I help you?
Back in the 1970s.
It was really surprising.
I had no idea.
That this was going on.
They said they argued.
A fair amount.
What would you say if we said.
We believe mark is a suspect?
We were all looking.
For charlotte and marx.
You just get disappointed.
And discouraged.
Every time you come back.
Without finding anybody.
It was just a really,
Really dark time.
I just sort of withdrew,
You know, and, you know,
Stayed by the house.
And, you know,
Did whatever odd jobs
I could to keep.
A subsistence lifestyle.
At least I did,
That she has gone somewhere.
To make a better life.
And they were, I hoped,
Happy and, you know,
Prosperous and living.
The family life.
With still no sign.
Of charlotte or marx,
The case officially goes cold.
Mark decides to leave hawaii.
Employment opportunities.
Were not there,
And so it was just time.
To come back to the states.
And try to start again.
Mark moves.
To northern california.
And continues to work.
As a freelance writer.
I got married, and the outcome.
Of that was two.
Beautiful daughters.
But mark still.
Can't put charlotte.
And marx's disappearance.
Behind him.
It's sort of like a landmine.
In the mind, you know.
It will just pop up.
At the most unexpected times.
- You know, and you go, - "Wow, I wonder where they are,
"I wonder what they're doing."
My first and second marriage.
Were both dissolved.
Because I was preoccupied.
With charlotte and marx.
Yeah, it's tough to feel.
Deeply enough for someone.
When you have someone else.
On your mind all the time.
I just wanted.
My mom,
And nobody.
Could tell me where she was.
Anything important.
Like birthdays.
Or high school graduation,
College graduation...
You want to celebrate.
That milestone.
Or whatever it is in your life,
And you...
You're not able to.
It was sad.
I was very sad.
Without any news.
Of charlotte and marx.
Around 2004, 2005,
I got involved.
In a really pretty big way.
I wanted it to become.
Front and center.
Because, again,
I needed to have.
Some kind of answer.
As to what happened.
In 2004, the state.
Attorney general's office.
Decides to take another.
Look at the case.
Jennifer travels to hawaii.
To meet with honolulu police.
I'm detective fitchett.
When we obtained copies of the.
Initial missing persons report,
The first thing we noted was,
When mark was interviewed.
He waited over.
Approximately three weeks.
Before he made.
The actual report.
He reported.
It on july the 10th.
All right, thank you.
Said that the last time.
He had seen her was 9:00.
In the morning.
On a tuesday... june the 21st.
Because it was reported late,
There was no one else.
To corroborate it.
Mark claimed that.
He called the police twice.
In the first few days.
After the disappearance.
But there's no record.
Of mark's prior calls.
There's a lot here.
Mark barnes was a person.
Of interest.
Because there was.
A delay in reporting.
And there was.
No subsequent information.
About where she was.
And I agreed with Jennifer.
That we could take a look.
And see where it would go.
With the investigation.
Thank you.
Detective fitchett.
And his partner returned.
To the neighborhood in hau'ula.
We started knocking on.
Neighbors' doors to try and see.
If anybody had been.
There back in the 1970s.
And we were very fortunate.
To find a neighbor.
That remembered.
These two people.
The relationship, he said,
Was kind of a volatile one.
They did get into arguments.
There was a lot of yelling,
A lot of fighting.
They weren't real friendly.
So, you know, pretty odd.
The investigative team.
Starts tracking down anyone.
Who was close.
To the couple back then.
In gresham, oregon.
In 2005, mark's friend.
From hawaii, jim murray,
Gets an unexpected visit.
Jim murray?
Yes.
Mind if we ask you.
A few questions.
Jim and mark have kept.
In touch over the years.
But jim doesn't know.
That charlotte's case.
Has been reopened.
It was really surprising.
I had no idea.
That this was going on.
What about mark?
They told me that mark.
Was a suspect.
No.
That really upset me because
I didn't believe that at all.
He wasn't that kind of guy.
I was convinced that mark.
Didn't do this,
That, you know,
It just wasn't in him.
He's too mellow of a person.
He was adamant that mark would.
Never commit such a crime...
Or hurt charlotte.
In any fashion,
And especially an infant child.
And he really wanted to make.
Sure that we understood that.
Jim's answers.
Are later confirmed.
When he takes a polygraph test.
That mark was guilty.
Of doing this.
It really never entered my mind.
All right, thank you.
We decided that we.
Would approach mark based.
Mark is still living.
In northern california,
And this is the first.
He's heard anything.
About the case in years.
I get a phone call.
From a cold case detective.
From the honolulu police.
Department.
He says he'd like.
To talk to me.
It's tough to digest.
I mean, for christ's sakes,
Now I'm a suspect of murdering.
My girlfriend and my son.
What are you guys.
Trying to do here?
When they indicated.
That they thought that I was,
You know, the primary suspect.
In this,
I told them it's ridiculous.
I mean, I had no motive.
It certainly wasn't for money.
And if it was to.
Get custody of marx,
There was plenty of legal ways.
Just a few things that we've.
Been going about the case.
That we want to clear up.
He gave me the information.
Pretty much it was consistent.
With the missing persons case.
That he filed back in 1977.
Let's see.
Why mark waited three weeks.
To file a missing persons report.
For charlotte and marx.
He discussed the fact.
That she had been missing.
On several occasions.
Previous to this,
And after a week.
Or three or four days,
She had come back.
Sometimes she would just...
Need to go, and I guess.
Be gone for a couple days.
And she'd come right back.
They also inquire.
About witness reports.
Of loud arguments.
Between mark and charlotte.
He admitted.
To several arguments,
But he felt he was not.
Physically violent towards her.
So after completing.
The interview, he adamantly.
Denied having any involvement.
In her disappearance physically.
We asked him if he's participate.
In a polygraph.
I said, "Sure."
So they hooked me up.
To a lie detector.
Have you ever lived.
In new mexico?
No.
They asked me all these.
Rather inane.
And don't make any sense.
Sort of questions.
You know, questions like, "Did."
You ever want to kill someone?"
No.
Both of us had a hard time.
Determining whether.
Or not mark was actually.
Telling us the truth.
But it's just... we didn't know.
The polygrapher wanted to call.
The test inconclusive.
At that stage.
Against mark,
Detective fitchett believes.
The case against him is strong.
I met with the honolulu police.
Homicide lieutenant,
And he agreed to move it.
From a missing persons case.
To a homicide case.
Investigators take.
A closer look at the property.
Where mark.
And charlotte had lived.
We ended up going back.
With the help of.
Groundpenetrating radar.
We just felt that maybe he would.
Dig a hole in the back yard.
Under the cover of night.
And bury the body there...
Or bodies there.
It took us a day.
And a half to dig this area.
We could not locate.
Any type of human remains.
With the case.
At an impasse once more,
All investigators can do.
Is file marx's profile.
And ageprogressed photo.
And exploited children.
Mr. Barnes agreed to submit.
To a dna process, also.
So that information was.
Registered and put on file.
We had dna from me and.
From my grandmother on file.
We're still hoping, right, that.
Something would come of this,
Even though we hit a dead end.
For the next.
Six years, mark barnes.
Remains a suspect,
Though police have yet to find.
Any incriminating evidence.
Against him.
Having the police come in.
And out of my life.
Unless you've been a suspect.
As a murderer, it's...
It's tough to digest.
And so that plays with you,
And you think, "Well, you know",
Are the police gonna.
Pull up at the door.
And say, 'well,
"You're under arrest'?"
You have that sort of anxiety.
All the time.
Then, in november 2011,
Comes the most stunning moment.
In this 34year mystery.
I got a call from the honolulu.
Police department...
Saying that...
"Your son is alive."
Not long after I gave.
The last dna samples.
And they said, "Well..."
We have a match with your dna...
To your son.
"Your son is alive."
I was elated.
"Can I talk to him?
Can I see him?"
But they won't tell me.
Anything else.
My name is
William stevens tenzin carter.
Growing up, I never really.
Had any questions.
About my lineage.
Or where I was from.
It was, I was adopted at three.
And a half, this is my family,
And this is who I am.
34yearold
Steve carter knew.
He had lived in hawaii.
Until he was adopted,
But he had very little.
Information about his origins.
I didn't really start.
To contemplate my birth parents.
Until I was in college,
And didn't really want.
To do anything else.
Until I started having.
Children of my own.
In the spring of 2011,
Who discovered her true identity.
Through a website run.
By the national center.
For missing.
And exploited children.
"Hey, go check it out."
It was at lunch that day.
That I shut my office door.
And went to the web site,
And actually.
Entered the criteria.
State... hawaii.
Sex... male.
And then how long.
You'd been missing.
The top response.
Was marx barnes,
Who went missing at six months,
Had a birthday.
Very similar to mine.
And the age progression.
Photo they had was a lot.
Like looking in a mirror.
As soon as I saw the picture,
I immediately copied and pasted.
Saying, "Hey, what do you think?"
Is this me?"
Everybody was like,
"Yeah, that's you."
later that day,
Steve calls.
The honolulu police department.
The results are in, sir.
They ask him.
To submit a dna sample.
It's a match.
The dna sample confirmed.
That steven carter was in fact.
The offspring of mark barnes.
And charlotte moriarty.
It's a tremendous.
Emotional feeling for me,
Locating this infant.
After all of these years.
I never in my wildest dreams.
Like this.
After 30plus years.
After steve's parents.
Adopted him in hawaii,
The new family moved.
To an affluent town.
In new jersey,
Where he grew up.
I was so lucky to have.
These parents.
My reaction to finding out.
That I was marx panama.
Was a difficult one.
You know, you grow up.
A good portion.
Out there that's been.
Looking for you...
It's tough.
When steve gets.
The dna test confirming.
He is marx barnes,
He calls mark.
Hello, is this mark?
Yes.
Was probably one.
My more difficult ones.
I introduced myself, and the.
First thing mark said to me was,
"How's your mother?"
Mark was very shocked.
That charlotte wasn't with me.
That they were.
Just living the family life.
I was absolutely floored.
In new mexico,
Steve's halfsister Jennifer.
Gets the news that her.
Little brother is alive.
When I heard.
That marx was found,
That it was marx,
I went into shock.
I never imagined that.
They would find marx alive.
And living a really nice life.
He's extremely happy.
And welladjusted.
And it's just incredible.
Steve provides police.
With a key piece of the puzzle,
His birth certificate.
From the orphanage in honolulu,
Where his name is listed.
As "Tenzin amea."
Detective fitchett is now.
Able to trace back
Charlotte moriarty's steps.
On the day she.
And marx disappeared.
Looking through.
Records at h.P.D.,
I was able to determine.
That charlotte left mark.
That day,
Left the stroller,
Went riding on a bus.
Somehow turned up on.
The other side of the island.
On june 22, 1977,
The day after charlotte.
And marx disappeared,
A woman now believed to be
Charlotte shows up.
At a stranger's house.
Carrying an infant.
It's my little girl.
Based.
On the police report,
This person that was caucasian.
But gave a japanese name.
Identified the baby.
As a female,
And asked the homeowner.
For milk and a diaper change.
I'll see if.
There's something for her.
The homeowner,
Alarmed by the woman's state,
Calls the police.
So this is where things.
Get really crazy.
My mother gives a false name,
She says her name is jane amea.
She gives a false name to steve.
She says his name.
Is tenzin amea.
They felt that she was.
In need of mental help.
So he escorted the female.
To the hawaii state hospital.
For psychiatric evaluation.
And they take the child.
Into protective custody.
I don't know why she.
Gave false information.
To me, it seems like she wanted.
To hide her child.
For some reason,
Maybe knowing that she.
Would come back for him.
Jane amea remains.
At the hospital for five days,
Where a social worker tries.
To reunite her with her baby.
"Here's the address."
And then jane amea leaves,
Against medical advice,
Into the night.
They don't know where she went.
There's just no trace.
Of her after that.
I can't see charlotte.
Giving marx up.
I mean, I truly believe.
That she would have kept him.
As tight as she possibly could.
But, evidently,
She must have had.
Some sort of psychological break.
That she just...
She just lost it.
I don't have any.
Animosity towards charlotte.
Nor would I have.
Any mother or father.
Who gives a child up.
For adoption.
If she found it better to move.
On and do something else,
I don't blame her.
For it, you know.
I've had a pretty amazing life.
Now I've just got.
A larger family,
A family that I'd like.
To spend more time with.
To this point, I've met my.
Halfsister Jennifer twice.
Meeting Jennifer is amazing.
Growing up your entire life,
Thinking you're an only child,
And finally find somebody.
Who is related to you.
I feel.
A deep connection to him.
You know, he's like.
My little brother,
You know,
Who's been through a lot.
His biological father, mark.
I'm fearful to bring.
Everybody together too quickly.
I've talked to him on the phone.
A handful of times.
We've exchanged.
Letters and texts.
I would say that I'm ready.
To meet mark very soon.
I would love to.
You know, just to be.
Able to see him.
Hopefully, at some point, when.
He's ready, we'll get together.
Since steve's.
Identification in 2011,
There have been no additional.
Leads in charlotte's case.
I can't really leave new mexico.
Because, even though.
It's 40 years on,
There's a part of me.
That still thinks.
That she'll come back for me.
So...
I have things out that.
Remind me of my mother.
It feels extremely safe and.
Very comforting, and I feel...
That she's with me.
I still wonder every day.
About charlotte.
Whoo!
If charlotte ever shows up,
Which I'm almost positive.
She will at some point,
What would I ask her?
Well, you would have to take.
A legal pad,
Divide it into four different.
Columns, number them down.
I have that many.
Questions to ask.
I miss her a lot.
I miss her presence.
I just can't find her.
Hopefully, she'll find me.
