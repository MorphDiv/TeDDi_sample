Previously on "How to Get Away with Murder"...
Somebody killed him, burned his body, and misplaced it!
- We're gonna find it.

Otherwise, you're gonna have a lot of people thinking there's a conspiracy going on.
Say something else about my boys.
You didn't just neglect them.

It looks worse than it feels.
They hurt you.
I erased Annalise's phone that night.
- I know.

If you have anything to say, you need to say it through your lawyer.
I fired the guy.

Someone signed off on having his body transferred
- to another morgue.

You.
Hey.
Hey.
Hello?
Hey.
Damn.
Yeah, they got me pretty good.
Atwood's targeting me, too.
My signature ended up on the form to transfer Wes' body.
You sure it's her?
Yeah, I was asking too many questions.
- You need to go to Denver, tell him.

I'm just not sure that's all they got on me.
Nate?
I was at your house that night.
Hey.
Annalise up there?
No.
Door was open.
The detectives let you go?
You're in on this.
No.
You should take the deal they're offering.
They're gonna take her down eventually.
For what?
Sinclair, Sam, framing me.
You sure you want to go down for all that?
She chooses herself every time.
You're wrong.
I've been in your place, thinking you owe her things.
I just need to talk to her.
- So she can play you again?

He said you were looking out for him... ever since he was a kid... got him into law school.
She's not who people make her out to be.
Of course she is.
Then why has she protected me even when I didn't deserve it?
What's that mean?
I've done awful things to her.
Like...?
- Wes.

Lahey here.
Gibbins walked out on us.

Why would I?
You were standing outside of his interrogation room the last time I saw you, so...
I don't know where he is.
I left him there.
If anybody checks my phone, they'll see I was at the house that night.
Thank you for telling me.
Stop.
You didn't have to do that.
He died 'cause I left him there.
Don't thank me for anything.
We'll fix this.
I promise you.
We're gonna fix it.
Thank you all for coming.
I know you didn't have to.
You could have just...

Is that really an option?
I failed.
I promised to protect you all, and I didn't.
I tried, but... the D.A. offered Wes immunity.
It would make sense to come to you next.
AK, come on.

We don't know that.
The D.A. really wants to take me down for this.
And I would imagine that anything that they offered would be hard to turn down.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.

No.

Yeah.

Laurel, please, just sit down.
Why aren't we talking about going after the people who killed Wes?
We don't know who killed him.
He testified against Charles Mahoney a week before he died.
It's not that simple.
It is... and we should do something.
These people are dangerous.
So what... we're just gonna sit around and act weak and victim-y?
No one's acting like a victim.
You are.
Have you said your piece?

Hack it.
You hack it.
I don't know how, obviously.
Well, then, there's your answer.
Oliver, what if she's hiding something?
Then I think we should respect her wishes, and let it stay hidden.
Is that why you saved a copy?
Because I think you did because your gut's telling you that Annalise is being sketchy.
You didn't see her that night.

Maybe 'cause she killed Wes.

You don't really believe that, do you?
I don't know what I believe.
That's why I'm asking you to go through what was on her phone.
If we don't find anything, great.
I have to look for a new job now that Annalise is pretty much fired.
Otherwise, we're both gonna be sleeping on Michaela's couch.
Well, you're not gonna need a job when the police find out you're sitting on illegally-obtained evidence.
What if we found out something terrible?
I'd rather stay blissfully ignorant.
This isn't about us, Oliver.

If Annalise had anything to do with him dying a horrible, horrible death, then the world needs to know that.
Hopefully, there's a Nate peen pic on here, or something.
There's this case in Missouri.

They had three defendants charged with second-degree murder, until the police lost the body.
Judge threw out the whole case.
They lost the body before the M.E. did an autopsy in that case.
So we file some motion about them hiding evidence.
That's not how this works.
Why not?
The fact that you don't know is exactly why you should re-hire you lawyer.
Did you just imply I'm stupid?
You're acting stupid.
Even the fact that we're meeting here.
It makes it look like you and Annalise are colluding, which is... maybe what you want.
What's that supposed to mean?
I told you to go look for Wes at the house.
The next thing I hear... he's dead.
He wasn't at the house when I got there.
I'm innocent.
- Call your lawyer, hire him back.

Wait!
How's everyone doing?
Laurel's fine.
No!

Atwood's targeting me, too.
My signature ended up on the form to transfer Wes' body.
We'll fix this.
We're just gonna sit around and act weak and victim-y?
"Attention, Ingrid Peters, Esquire.
Pennsylvania office of the Deputy Attorney General.
My name is Annalise Keating, and this is a demand letter seeking a grand-jury investigation into a conspiracy launched against me by the Philadelphia District Attorney's office."
Howard?
Call me "Howie."
Got it.
"This letter serves as a formal complaint in petition for investigation into prosecutorial misconduct committed by A.D.A. Renee Atwood.
The following is a list of her unlawful actions.
Acting on personal bias and false information,
Ms. Atwood arrested and held me without probable cause, just by the confession by a career criminal,
Frank Delfino."
You know, this is a big case.
Well, that's why I'm paying you big bucks.
"A.D.A. Atwood orchestrated the disappearance of the victim's body, thereby tampering with evidence and obstructing a fair and impartial trial."
What do you think?
It's war.
Exactly.
"I demand you launch an immediate grand-jury investigation into A.D.A. Atwood.

"I will personally see to it that the corruption in this office is publicly and irreparably exposed."
These are big claims.
I was left with no other choice.
Actually, there are a lot of other choices besides invoking the power of the State.
I know my legal options.
I also know how important it is for the Attorney General's office to investigate any charges of prosecutorial misconduct.
Please, if every criminal in the state was allowed to file suit because their D.A. was being
- a little overzealous...

Do you not think this constitutes a lawsuit?
I'm sorry.

A.D.A. Atwood physically assaulted you?
Worse!
She disappeared a young man's body in order to frame me for murder.
- Please do not raise your voice.

The corruption scandal that would follow your whole career?
There goes any chance at a judgeship or congressional seat.
Is that what you want?
This office does not tolerate threats.
Find that body.
Otherwise, it won't just be a threat.
I will not stand by and let baseless accusations be leveled at any of my prosecutors.
And I won't stand by while you frame my client for murder.
You think Ingrid Peters is gonna take
Keating's accusations seriously?
She better.

There are bodies piling up around this woman, and you think she deserves justice?
- Renee...

What about that poor young man who was burnt to a crisp?
Where's his justice?
We'll see you at the grand jury.
We can hit you back, Ms. Winterbottom.
This office has files on everyone in Ms. Keating's life.
You, her students...
Are you really sure you want to go down this road?
We're already there.
They'll probably offer us the same deal as Wes.
I mean, we know everything that he did.
Dude, shut up.
I will go Red Wedding on anyone who rats out Annalise.
Even Laurel, because where is she?
She seemed pissed enough to go get herself a deal.
She's at home... grieving.
So she's at the police station.
Dude, the D.A. would have already come to us if they wanted to offer us a deal.
Mm, that's not true.
Okay, we've been back at school for five minutes.
Can we at least pretend to study?
So why haven't they approached us yet?
A million reasons, especially if this is a... conspiracy, like Annalise claims it is.
Stop talking.

Maybe it was a crime of passion, or...
I said to stop talking.
Oh, my God, do you think she has this room bugged?
Hello?
I can't make Laurel not be mad at you.
She gets to be mad right now, and whatever other emotions she's feeling.
It's called the grief process, so don't try and trick me into making you two besties or something.
- That's not why I called you here.

Can I just speak?
I know you, Annalise, and, yes,
I just called you Annalise, which I think is appropriate, considering where we are in our relationship.
You can call me whatever you want.
I just did.

I am your biggest advocate right now.
So just admit what you need rather than whatever game this is.
You're right.
Okay?

Bonnie said you've been holding everyone up.
That doesn't surprise me.
I'm just... sorry that you're in this position.
But it is what it is right now.
You're the one they listen to, so...
I'm just asking if there's anyone
I need to be worried about right now.
Everyone's fine.
You sure?
Yes.
Because like you just said,
I've been cleaning up all your mess while you've been in jail.
Is that all?
Okay.
So, you admit that's your signature?
- Yes.

Nope.
So you think someone who had access to your signature
- forged this?

Do you have theories about who forged it?
Can't say.
You got the State involved?

I told them to look into Atwood.
- Well, now she's looking into me.

You were gonna be investigated either way.
Not by the State!
You seriously think this lady's gonna charge her own prosecutor?
She will once she finds out they're setting you up.
If she finds out!

- Nate...

I know these people, how to manage them.
Maybe before... but they think you're a joke now.
Stop trying to help me.
It only makes things worse.
We could pull the complaint.
No.
Find out where Oliver is.
Mind if I come in?
Of course not.

Connor told me you got out on bail, which I guess is cause for congratulations.
Or something.
Is everything okay?
That depends.
On...?
If we're still good.
"Good"?
Well, a lot has changed since we last spoke.
Yeah, well, not for me.
Well, let me just say this...
Oliver... there's no reason for you to protect me.
We both know that... but you've been very steady.
And it means a lot to me, especially right now.
It means a lot to me, too.
So... is it the D.A.'s office again?
You need me to do a little hacky McHackerson for you?
It's easier than that.
Janice said you needed me?
Look.
This bitch.
I'm no joke.
Castillo!
Open the door, or I'll call your landlord.
Hey.

Oh, I'm not hungry.
Everyone's hungry for dessert.
Come on.

Who's in there?
Uh, no one.
Michaela!
Who are you?
Uh... a friend.
I'll be in touch.
- Wait, are you banging that dude?

Banging him is fine.

Who is he?
Private investigator.
- Are you a moron?

Before you yell at me...

Sylvia Mahoney submitted DNA to a lab for analysis five days before Wes' death.
So?

Actually, I found out that I have some Japanese
- in my genes.

They must have found out he was Wallace's son.
That's why they killed him.
Hello?
Annalise.

- You got out on bail?

That's great.
Isn't it?
Of course.

Yes, everything's fine.
I just called the minute I heard.
The Board's nervous, right?
What?
They think I'm gonna ask to go back to work.
- Tell them to relax.

I'm crazy, but I'm not so crazy to think that they'd let me within 100 yards of that campus.
Look, just don't think about any of that right now.
You're out of jail.
And that's a great thing, so... do you need anything... clothes, help finding a place to stay?
No, I'm good.
I actually have an appointment about to start, so...
Oh, okay.
Just call me if you need anything... or if you want to go to a meeting.
I will.
Talk.
Laurel hired a private investigator.
He found this.
The Mahoneys ran a DNA test on Wes.
They knew who he was.
Possibly.
You're just like Wes.

You ask questions about things you can't understand.
This proves they killed Wes.
No, what it proves is, you don't listen.
What did I tell you about these people?

This could mean that Atwood is working with the Mahoneys to frame you.
You could take this to the police.
- The police who are trying to set me up?

These people will hurt us, all of us.

I was pregnant, eight months, and they murdered my baby.
I was just like you... just trying to do the right thing, stood up to them... and they destroyed my life.
We have to do whatever it takes to stay safe.
That's what's important right now.
Wes deserved so much better than you.
Hi.

Laurel didn't mean that.
Yes, she did.

I'm sorry about your baby.
And, uh...

I...
I know how close you both were, and... this all... this all just really... sucks.
Anyway, maybe I shouldn't have said anything.
I...

Asher.
Yeah?
You don't need to worry about me.
Yeah, you should listen to her.
Worry about Laurel, the D.A.'s office coming after us, not Annalise.
She's a human being.
At the very least, she deserves our sympathy.
Oh.
Say, "She's a human and deserves our sympathy."
You have my sympathy because you're a blind, trusting fool.
- Micky?

Yeah, I know.
I was hoping it would disarm you for what I'm about to say.
What if Connor was the anonymous source?
- What?

He was sexing Thomas.
Or he was at the police station signing his own immunity deal.
No.

Okay, well, why does he keep pushing us to turn on Annalise?
Okay, do you know why families turn on each other?
Because one family member starts talking crap about another family member.
And then boom, it's "The Borgias."
- I'm just saying, we should ask him...

You will do nothing of the sort.
You will forget we ever had this conversation and promise to never bring it up again.
Yes?
Michaela...
Unh!
The only appropriate answer here is to nod.
A dead baby is pretty much the only guaranteed thing to make you feel bad for someone.
You're being so mean.
Well, this is Annalise we're talking about.
Yeah, but people rarely make up stories about their dead children, so... maybe you could...
I don't know... believe the poor woman for once, especially with the way her face is looking right now.
How do you know how her face looks?
Was she here?
Why?
She needed me to leak that article.
Are you sure?
Yes.

You don't... think it's a little convenient that she came over at the exact same time that you're hacking her phone?
No, I think you're being paranoid.
And you're being naive.
Okay, I'm being naive.

By the way, you never told me that she called you over to the house that night.
Uh, yeah, I did.
No, I knew she left a message for Laurel and Wes, but not you.
I got the voicemail the next day.
Why are you asking me about this?
No reason.
No naked Nate pics, huh?
Straight people are so boring.
You can all stop stalking me.
It's not like I'm gonna go crazy or anything.
No one would blame you if you did.
You've been through a lot.
I'm fine.
Good.
I'll tell Frank.
He asked about you.
Did you know her when she was pregnant?
I was a 1-L.
Was she happy?
Happier.
I can make you an appointment.
If you make a decision that you're worried people will judge you for.
Annalise.
We can tell her you had a miscarriage.
You're just as bad as her.
Hello?
You are receiving a call from an inmate at Philadelphia County Prison.
This call is being recorded.
To accept the charges, press 3.
Bonnie?
You there?
We're being recorded.
Look...

I've been thinking about things, and...
I just want you to know that...
I'm doing everything I can for our case.
So if you need anything from me... at all...

Whatever you want.
Yes?
It's Ingrid Peters.
I'm rejecting your request for a grand-jury investigation.
Excuse me?
You leaked this article to the press.
I didn't have anything to do with a leaked article.
Let me be blunt.

I will order Mr. Denver to go not only for life in prison on your case, but the death penalty.
That is what I call a threat.
_
_
_
So, I guess you're my sponsor now.
Oh.

Makes it sound too official.
Thank you.
Sorry I can't take your case after all that.
That's fine.
No.

'Cause your only real chance of winning was if I was representing you, so...
You good?
How's your case going?
You don't have to talk about it.
It's a good sign that you're out on bail, though, right?
I thought you said we didn't have to talk about this.
I'm sorry.

I just can't imagine what you must be going through.
Oh!
Um... so there's a huge controversy going on about the naming rights for the new wing of the law library.
Why are you here?
I just came to make sure you were okay.
We can't have a glorified accident attorney as our namesake.
Just call me if you need anything.
What did she offer you?
Excuse me?
Atwood.
Did she promise to get you custody of your kids?
Don't make me feel like a bigger fool than I already do.
They're my children.
You'd do the same thing if you were in my shoes.
We should just kill her.
What?
Atwood.

The important thing is, you found out.
What does that get me?
Peace of mind while I go to jail for the rest of my life?
Tell them Nate was at the house that night.
I can just suggest they look at his phone records.
No.
It gives them another suspect who isn't you.
Is this really who you want to be?
The people who burn down everything around them, everyone around them?
I don't.
I'm going to bed.
Bonnie?
Frank have a lawyer yet?
Where's Oliver?
He's at home, looking for a new job.
Which is a better use of time than us being here.
The judge needs to see that the people that loved Wes
- think Annalise is innocent.

Here he goes again.
- Stop.

Why don't you say "Hi" to your buddy Atwood over there?
You could thank her for the deal she got you.
- What deal?

So put your penises away.
Mr. Delfino, since you've called us all here today, why don't we let you begin.
Thank you, Your Honor.
I'd like to file a subpoena duces tecum for all of A.D.A. Atwood's personal correspondence on the day the victim's body was lost.
Objection, Your Honor.
Ms. Atwood's correspondence is protected from disclosure by the Work Product Doctrine.
An exception has to be made when there's a missing body, no?
Our people are closing in on where the body is.
Yeah, but at that point, the chain of custody will be broken, all because A.D.A. Atwood lost the body on purpose.
Mr. Delfino is only arguing this motion at the direction of Annalise Keating, who was warned about such actions.
Your Honor, my client has had no communication with Mr. Delfino.
Oh, please, Ms. Winterbottom went to visit Mr. Delfino this morning.
Yes, to convince him to re-hire his lawyer, so it wouldn't look like we were colluding, which, ironically, we're now being accused of.
This was all my idea, Judge.
I'm a little offended Mr. Denver's trying to give someone else credit.
All right, let me stop you right there, Mr. Delfino.
Without concrete evidence of your theory, the law says Ms. Atwood's private communications cannot be subpoenaed.
I have evidence.

Get it, Frank.
This is the victim's Morgue Transfer sheet, signed by an investigator hired by Ms. Atwood's office,
Nate Lahey.
This is proof Mr. Lahey moved and hid the body from Ms. Atwood.
Mr. Lahey does not work on this case, Judge.
He's Ms. Atwood's boyfriend.

Is this true, Ms. Atwood?
You have a romantic relationship with Mr. Lahey?
We were at some point, but it ended before this case.
Were you aware of such a relationship, Mr. Denver?
The D.A.'s office imposes no restrictions on its staff regarding workplace relationships.
Mr. Delfino, though ill-advised,
A.D.A. Atwood and Mr. Lahey broke no laws.
What about the Sixth Amendment?
That's the one that says every defendant has the right to a fair trial, correct?
Well, what's happening here?
The prosecution's tampering with evidence, showing bias, not to mention they got tons of conflict of interest.
That's the opposite of fair.
It's just a damn subpoena, Your Honor.
Watch your language, Mr. Delfino.
Sorry.
But you did hit on a valid point.
Mr. Delfino is correct in that even just the appearance of bias can waive the D.A.'s protection from disclosure.
Only in extreme cases, Judge.
I find this to be one of those.

Ms. Atwood, you are hereby ordered to turn over your e-mails, calls, and text messages for the day the body was transferred.
You have jeopardized this case and the integrity of my office.
Every shred of evidence that you have been in contact with, now comes into question.
And all because you needed to get laid!
I can fix this.

Are you kidding?

You will give me those records so I can prepare for what is coming down the line.
I can tell you what's coming.
This was the only way we could get at Atwood.
And it's gonna hit her harder than it hits you.
- Annalise.

- God knows...

Atwood admitted she moved Wes' body.
I'm in the clear.
Did they find the body?
Hi.
Wow.
You came all the way over here, and you still don't know what to say to me?
How about this.
"I'm sorry, Laurel." You could start there.
Laurel...
What?
Wes was cremated.
Isn't this good?
I mean, not that it's good.

But if he's cremated, then we can get AK's charges dropped.
I mean, any jury's gonna find that sketchy.
Our it just means Annalise can't prove she didn't do this.
Is that true?
I don't know.
Where is Annalise?
- None of your business.

Do you have a problem?
Because I understand why Laurel might be acting like a little bitch right now, but not you.
- You have no idea.

No, BonBon needs to hear this.
'Cause you know why I think family's get torn apart?
- Because secrets.

No, what is this secret, Asher?
No, I'm leaving if this is about to turn into another brawl.
I think Connor's the anonymous source.
So, Atwood's working with the Mahoneys, like I said.
It's possible.
It's true.
We shouldn't jump to any conclusions right now.
What happened to you in there?
It's jail.

But it's your life we're talking about.
If you don't care about Wes, I get that.
But care about yourself.
I care about Wes.
You don't need to say that just 'cause you think it sounds good.
I'm still in shock that he's gone.
He's not your son.

You don't need to cry about him in front of me.
But I do need you to take action.
Yeah, I do need you to be the person that you promised us you were.
You know, that's why we've been following you this whole time and trusting you.
Because you said that you knew what you were doing!
But now one of us just got killed, and we need to find out who did that!
Where's your proof?
Your behavior's my proof.
What the hell does that even mean?
You keep saying that Annalise did this, even though all the evidence points to the fact that it was the Mahoneys.
You keep saying Annalise did this?
He's exaggerating.
No, he's not.
You would defend your stupid boyfriend.
Even since Wes died, all you've done is point the finger at Annalise, which is suspicious behavior.
The first thing guilty people do is try to blame someone else.
Like a fart.

Fine, I think there's quite a good chance that Annalise did this.
- Why?

That she had Oliver clear.
Because it holds information about a lot of bad things we all do.
That doesn't mean that one of them
- was killing Wes.

Yes!
'Cause I'm about to have proof.
Oliver kept a copy of Annalise's phone and has been going through it.
- Are you kidding?

Are you sure you want to keep denying Annalise's involvement?
You think I don't care about him?
You really think that?
I don't know.
He wasn't my son.
Maybe it would be easier if he was.
Then I would know... how I feel... what I feel right now.
All I know is that it's horrific... and I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I'm just...

I know.
He deserved so much better than this.
He did.
I promise you that we're gonna find who did this to him.
We owe him that.
Hey.
Hey, so, uh...

Oli?
All this time, you've been telling me
Annalise was hiding something when you're the one with the secret.
What are you talking about?
You checked your voicemail that night.
I kept wondering why it took you so long to get to the hospital.
I just figured you were with Thomas the whole time, boning for six hours.
So I called him.
He said that you left his apartment hours before the fire, and that you used his cellphone to check your voicemail.
You went to Annalise's house that night, didn't you?
1, 2, 3, 4.
