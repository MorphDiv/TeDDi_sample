"Soldier"
Rookies!

We've got this.
Let the ODM gear do what it was designed for.
Attack!
Someone was here not that long ago.
A place this close to the wall?
Bandits probably used it as a hideout.
A sign on the way in said "Ruins of Utgard Castle."
I didn't know there was a historical site around here.
Hey, take a look at what I just stumbled on.
You're kidding!

Uh-huh.
Can't really read the label, though.
You're not gonna drink it now?
Don't be smart.

You know, there are worse ways to spend a night than having access to top-shelf contraband.
Careful.

I want you kids to try and get some rest.
There shouldn't be any Titans crawling around at this time of night, but we'll take turns keeping watch.
Be ready to leave four hours shy of daybreak.
'Scuse me.

Where do, uh...
Where else could they be coming from?
It's our job to find out.
Starting tomorrow.
I'm just saying.

But is it as bad as we think?
Y'never know, right?

She's right.
We haven't really seen that many Titans.
I mean, for them to have busted through the wall, anyway.
Only with the initial sighting, a relatively modest handful.
Conny?

Totally destroyed.
It was crushed to tinder and bits of rubble.
I'm, uh...

Nobody got devoured, though.
Looked like they all got out, so there's a silver lining, at least.
I thought that you said it was destroyed?
Well, the houses and stuff were, but the people themselves must've all escaped.
I mean, they had to've.
The thing is... we didn't see any blood anywhere.
Not so much as one drop.
That's the only possible explanation.
Still, though.

There was a Titan on top of our house.
Just lying there.

It couldn't move on its own, thank God.
But, I just...

Am I crazy?
Conny.

- It was your imagination...

You actually think your mom might be a Titan?
Oh, honey!

We all knew you were dumb as a bag of rocks, but this?
Whoa, man!

Ha-ha.

Guess I was kinda asking for it.
Don't stop there:

Basic biology.

Okay, I get it!

Ymir?

Heh.

Here to ravage me?
Don't take this wrong way, but I didn't think you were all that into girls.
Really?

I didn't think you were all that into guys.
Heh.

I'd prefer not to meet my maker on an empty stomach.
Look, the whole thing earlier with Conny.
Were you teasing him to get his mind off of things?
It'd be great if you could keep that up.
The less he dwells on his family right now, the better.
What are you talking about?
Huh.

Herring's not my favorite, but whatever.
Herring, huh?

Help yourself.
I can't believe there's canned food here.
What, the...

I can't read a word of it.
How do you know this says "herring?"
This, uh, label.

Ymir.

Everyone, wake up!
Get to the tower immediately!
Bother someone else.
I should be drinking right now, damn it!
You're standing between me and a tankard of Ale!
Attack!
Think it's gonna be that easy, big guy?
I got news for ya!

Hot damn!
You little ones should watch where you're going!

Dumb-asses.
I don't think you're one to talk.
There's no call to be so reckless.
Did you have to waste your blades?
That's just how I do things.
You'd better chalk that one up as an assist.
Aren't you the hero.

Oh, no.

The door's been kicked down!
Titans are in the castle!
Get below and improvise some sort a barricade!
Be careful.

Now hurry.

There are quite a few.

But by God we'll fight to the last breath.
Our heart and soul to the cause, right?

Got it!
I'll go see how far they've gotten in.
You find something to board up the entrance!
Whatever isn't nailed down!
Reiner, wait!
What the hell?
Hang on, we're coming!

Are you kidding me?
Why's he always gotta be the first one to step up?
Give us a break!
I know.

Are they in the tower?
The door's still barred.
Not that that'll keep 'em out for long.
They're in the tower!
Get down here and help me!
Is this it?

Son of a bitch!
No.

I refuse!
I'm going back home!
Reiner!
Talk to me, man.

Yes!

We're gonna make it home!
This is not how we die!
Yeah, I know.

Guys!

Where'd you find...?

Yeah, right, if only!
It was pure luck that we found this.
Get out of the way!
May miracles never cease.

Yeah.

Good thing it was a little one.
What now?

Should I cut the nape, or...?
Don't risk it.

Then, I think it would be best if we head back upstairs for now.
We have no way of knowing if that's the only one who got in.
Huh?
Conny!
Huh?
Conny!
Reiner, no!
Holy...

Wait.

Are you gonna jump out the window with it?
We've got no other choice.
No!

I think I can slice its jaw open!
There!
What do we do if another one gets in?
Not like we'll find another cannon lying around, am I right?
Probably.

Sorry, I know it stings.
Plus, the bone's most likely fractured.
Of course.

We'll need a splint and a bandage.

The cloth's filthy.
I haven't been able to wash it in forever.

No sweat.

Marry me.
So you gonna be all right or what?
Think so.

Y'know, Christa, I, uh...
I got a little scratched up myself.
Ugh.

Anyway, sorry about all that, man.
Seems like you're always having to save my ass.
You and everyone else.
Even Annie put herself on the line for me once.
I owe you.

No, no.

We have each other's back.
It's what soldiers do.
I don't know.
I doubt I could ever be that courageous.
Has he always been like this?
The self-sacrificing type?
No.

In the old days, Reiner was more of a warrior.
Warrior?

Anyway, let's scrounge around for stuff we can use.
If I have to die, I'd rather not do it 'cause we're being half-assed.
Oh, wow.

Say what you will, the Scouts get shit done.
That's mostly it for the big ones.
Good thing we have this tower.
No kidding.

We'll check on the recruits.
Okay.
What the hell's that noise?
The horses!
There it is again!
Wha...

Lynne!

Oh shit!
They're dead.

This can't...
He did this!
The one that made a B-line for the wall!
Hairy son of a bitch is randomly...
Heads up, guys!
We've got twice as many as before!
You're kidding!
It's like they're timing these attacks as some part of a larger strategy.
This isn't random at all.
We're being toyed with.
Damn it.

C'mon, go down!
Tower's not gonna hold.
Hey, my ODM gear's low on juice.

Fresh out.

Please tell me those aren't the only ones you've got left.
'Fraid so.
How many dead Titans the four of us rack up?
Couldn't say.
I was too preoccupied to keep count.
Yeah, well.

Heh.

What's a guy gotta do to get a drink around here?
This isn't the time for...
I'm sorry, Nanaba.
I must've bashed my head.
I...

Gelgar!
Gelgar, no!
That's it.

There is a God.
Oh, come on.

Why would you do me that way?
Who drank my Goddamn booze?
They got him.
Christa, what're you doing?

The tower's gonna give any second!
You have to stay still!
Let go!

- Nanaba.

Please!

I'll be a good girl from now on, I promise!
No, Daddy!

Aah!

We sit around waiting for the tower to collapse and let ourselves get eaten alive?
That's it?

This is bullshit.

No, this...

If I could find a weapon, I'd go down fighting.
At least try to be worthy of the people who died for us.
Christa, please.

Don't use their deaths as an excuse.
They didn't sacrifice themselves so you could fulfill some fantasy about going out in a blaze of glory.
Ymir!

And you damn-well know you're not like Conny and the others!
They're in this to give humanity a fighting chance.
Deep down all you care about is having the word "hero" carved on your epitaph.
That...

Conny.

Huh?

Just give it here.
Fine.

You're very sweet, thanks.
What do you even need it for?
Hm.

Just gonna give 'em a little hell.
Okay, then.

If I do, we'll learn what it is together.
Ymir.
Christa.

I realize you've probably forgotten.
But, since we're facing the end, try to think back.
Remember that oath that we made on the snowy mountain.
I have no business telling you how to live your life.
It's not my place.
So, I guess when you break it down, this is really just more of a hope.
Christa.

Never forget the promise we made.
Ymir, wait!
Ymir!
