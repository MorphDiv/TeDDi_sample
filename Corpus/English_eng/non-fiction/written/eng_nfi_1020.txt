for as long as mankind has fixed his gaze upon the heaven the age-old question has remained are we alone in the universe as our tools for exploring this vast expanse continue to improve the answer to our question comes more clearly into Boca
it's now estimated that for every grain of sand on planet Earth there is another earth-like planet capable of sustaining life so can we truly be alone
I can introduce a man who says there are more things between heaven and hell than any of us have accepted and I have the witnesses and the documents to prove it ladies and gentlemen dr.

extraterrestrial visitation typically these unacknowledged special access projects are taking in at least forty to eighty billion dollars per year and the study of extraterrestrial technology in covert military programs and they are sitting on technologies that can change the world forever this technology would
liberate Earth from possible environmental devastation and poverty in a single generation I didn't believe in
UFOs until London control called us in the winter of 1962 and asked us would we chase one their testimony would make history I said well you're going to tell the public about it and he says no we don't tell the public
about this with the panic to public this was the most watched event in the history of a national press point we actually did recoveries have crashed saucers the Rabat EES that were involved with some of these crashes also some
more alive it marks the beginning of the global disclosure movement is just we're hovering off the floor without any visible means of support they were referred to as alien reproduction vehicles 15 years later dr.

President of the United States by the Director of Central Intelligence
George Bush Senior they reveal the true story of the secrecy and of disclosure there is no evidence I wish to emphasize that these life-forms from elsewhere are hostile towards us but there is a great deal of evidence that they are concerned
with our hostility this is that story
Asli trees of green red roses too I see them bloom fucking you and I into myself what a wonderful world
ah see sky so blue and white the bright blessed day the dark sacred night and I think to myself
when I wonderful
the colors of the rainbow on the back I
say
I'm spam bro then I must move and I never knew and I think to myself what a wonderful
I think to myself what I wonderful
the phenomenon of UFOs does exist and it must be treated seriously Mikhail
Gorbachev
one of my biggest disappointment over the last 25 years is those who lack the courage of their convictions
1% of the people who I've talked with met with her brief had that courage this would have all been fixed long ago
I've always told you won't do it I will they'll hear go
oh I know we may be little indifferent extraterrestrial civilization every second Tuesday but there's no support for this appealing idea the extraordinary claims are not supported by extraordinary evidence it's always asked where is the evidence there where
is the beef on the UFO issue in fact we have so much evidence that dr.

Hynek who was in charge of Project Blue
Book for the air force stated that is an embarrassment of riches we have so much
I'm Richard Doty I was assigned as a special agent with Air Force Office of
Special Investigations at Kirtland Air
Force Base I was a counterintelligence officer at space during my time there my first few months there I was briefed into a special access program involving the US government's investigation and contacts with extraterrestrial the visitation of these extraterrestrials to
to earth I can assure you that flying saucers given that they exist are not constructed by any power on earth
President Harry s truth and it started out with a crash at Roswell headline
Division July 8 1947 the Army Air Force has announced that a flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army army officers say the missile found sometime last week has been infected at Roswell New Mexico and
sent to Wright Field Ohio for further inspection
Roswell is almost become a joke because there's so much myth the narrative around it but if you look at the guy who failed document the field agent sent to
Dave Hoover three so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico each one was occupied by three body with human shape but only three feet tall the
K has become the number one document viewed on the FBI website after we released it the craft is it wasn't it wasn't more or less an overage shaped craft it was a a saucer ship that the thicker craft there was some problems
with number one getting it on the flatbed to take it up to area 51 the interior craft was it didn't have any actual levers or flight control systems that we would identify as a flight control system but they eventually I think over some time
figured it out and it was done all by hands the creatures would put their hands on controls and they'd have this headset on and this headset would somehow control or help them control the aircraft they did discuss the fact that
there were bodies other extraterrestrial bodies yes the creatures were about four foot some of the creatures were mangled were heavily injured and their bodies were torn apart there were four aliens aboard that thing and those aliens went to Los Alamos and we were told that the
extra trustor went to Kirtland Field
Kirtland Air Force Base and then on to Los Alamos - pathologist said it wasn't anything in there in anatomy books and wouldn't anything and what part medical schools they had never seen anything like this first I thought
it was a child because it was small then
I looked at this head and off the head was different Tom's are spindly the body but it was great but the creatures were approximately four foot they had didn't appear to have any years they only had two officers they didn't
have earlobe had two year canals they had indentation for nose very very big eyes and large eyes the fingers had no thumbs just four four fingers suction devices on their tips of their fingers you know therefore fragile fingers in
the long arm real short joy it almost looked like they were new but they actually had a very thin but tight-fitting suit on one was alive partially alive at the time that this happened and died
I believe was 1952 but the the bodies of the the extraterrestrials that were found at the scene were in a deep freeze placing in deep freeze and incentive wright-patt filled in denial one of the briefing officers there was taking us
around and talking about what was going on they said there had been over a hundred crashes in that Four Corners area I just saw holy shit after Roswell there was a flurry of et activity across the globe dr.

2001 he formed the disclosure project what you're about to see is firsthand witness testimony of events over the past 50 years
many are telling their stories for the first time this is only the tip of the iceberg as hundreds more had given us their testimony but are too fearful to go on camera for fear of repercussions for themselves and for the family
I feel that the Air Force has not been giving out all the available information on these unidentified flying objects you cannot disregard so many unimpeachable sources honorable John
McCormick speaker of the house now I'm one of those would you would call the high government officials in the FAA I was a division chief it was only three or four down from the Admiral the way it started the Japanese airline 747 was
coming from the Northwest going across the Alaskan territory so his radar is picking up a target she sees this target with his eye and the target the way he described it was a huge ball with the lights running around it four times as
big as a 747 the Japanese fighter would say he's now eleven o'clock is not one o'clock he's now at three o'clock when he would say that the military guy would cut in and say he's now at two o'clock
or three o'clock and he would confirm the position he said it's the first time they ever had 30 minutes of radar data on a UFO and they're all itching to get their hands into the dative and if they
come out and told the American public that they ran into a UFO out there it would cause panic across the country so if we can't talk about it and they're taking all this data and I had the
pilots report that came through my dad the FAA first report that was all downstairs on my table they didn't answer that so I didn't give it
the plaintiff I was going to be flying in was an f-104 which was the fastest melon aircraft to mankind at that time so we're flying down the Rhine River we're up at high altitude and about that time I spotted a bogey at about 10
o'clock over here I don't recognize the breath
I said bogey 10 o'clock and the captain looked over there so well let's find out so he kicked it in afterburner and we went after that and it disappeared just like that he says please whatever you do
do not say anything about this in camera it will get me in much trouble that was my first introduction to cover-up so everything was going along pretty just ho-hum routine they dimmed the lights first in the command center when they
said of conditions Ebro alert most of the times when they set these wheels they would say this is a drill this is a drill but they turned the lights down this time and they didn't say this is a
drill we had contact with an unidentified flying object that it entered our airspace we had it on laid off for almost an hour the order was given by Admiral trained to try and get this icy force down out of the sky if at
all possible by whatever means possible what was really driving him nuts was this thing absolutely had complete control of the situation and could just be wherever it wanted to be just in a matter of seconds one minute officers may in the next
minute it's in Norfolk headed south towards Florida after that we found that it wasn't for Russians they didn't care who it was or where it was from they wanted it and wanted it bad at various times I loved it and unloaded regular
weapons and I was considered sane so to speak then able to handle nuclear weapons but apparently UFOs are well I know that they're well above even nuclear weapons and secrecy
one particular night we just finished our refueling mission London control called us and asked us if we would intercept the UFO over the center of
England roughly in the Stonehenge Oxford area where after 33,000 feet these UFO is Island about a thousand feet we'd Oban it eventually we got up to close to it and we could see what looked like a cruise ship out at sea with all
the lights and everything got about on a mile from it and it went up into space
London Control said you can continue on with the mission apparently Prince Philip called it was a very important we're invited to there at the officer's club where he was a speaker and he knew all about the fact
that we had chased the UFO he kind of made me a believer in a sense I had seen them personally of course before that but when someone of his stature indicates that they're real and probably from another planet it's very convincing
I believe that these et vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets which obviously are a little more technically advanced than we are here on earth astronaut Gordon
Cooper we should go boldly where man has not gone before flyby the Comets visit asteroids visit the moon of Mars there's a monolith there a very unusual structure on this little potato shaped object that goes around Mars once in
seven hours when people find out about that they're going to say who put that there who put that there dr.

decade because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one we intend to win the disclosure project archive includes testimony from extraordinary individuals who are part of this great effort to explore outer space including
astronauts Gordon Cooper and dr.

Mitchell the sixth man to walk on the moon yes there have been et visitation there have been crashed craft there have been material and bodies recovered and there is some group of people somewhere that may or may not be associated with
filming at this point but certainly were at one time that I've had this knowledge and have been attempting to conceal this knowledge we walked over to one side of the lab and he said by the way we've
discovered a base on the backside of the moon and I said I said whose what you need and then he pulled out one of these mosaics and showed showed this base which had geometric shapes there were towers there were spherical buildings
there are very tall towers and things that looked somewhat like radar dishes but they were large structures and at that point I became frightened and was a little terrified thinking to myself if anybody walks in the room now I know
we're we're in jeopardy we're in trouble because he should be giving me this information the crew of the carrier Kearsarge goes into action off Midway island in the
Pacific for the return of a hero major
Gordon Cooper the capsule door is blown off in Cooper's might end a performance that exceeded the most optimistic predictions I was having some the cameraman found the insulation of a precision landing facility we were putting in little into the dry leg the
saucer flew right over and put down three little year and landed out on the dry lake bed and they went out picked up their cameras and moved on out partying filming and he left it off put the gear back in the well find out the very high
rate of speed disappear and come on with involved in the research and development and doing very classified programs myself I need that we didn't have any vehicles of that kind the Rockies been moving reading at that point in time in Medina
in my mind this vehicle has made it someone is playing from here on earth watching TV officially the US government ended its study of UFOs in 1969 because it assured the public there is no proof the phenomenon represents a threat to
national security but what if these unknown aircraft showed an interest in our nuclear weapons a group of more than
150 military veterans missile officers security personnel including many who worked at the Nevada Test Site say they've seen mystery intruders over nuclear facilities
in advancing this concept Vandenberg Air
Force Base California has become the first aerospace operations center of the airport they actually photographed the
UFO following the missile as it climbed into space and shining a beam on it which neutralized to be missile it flew into the frame like this and it shot a beam of light at the warhead which is represented by my thumb here so this
thing fires a beam of light at the warhead hits it and then this thing flies up like this fires another beam of light goes around like this fires another beam of light goes down like this far as another beam of light and
then flies out the way it came in and the warhead tumbled out of it how to fake now when the lights came on major
Mansmann turned around to look at me and said we're you guys screwing around up there I said no sir and he said what was that and I said it looks to me like we got a UFO the idea of any explosion in
space by any earth government was not acceptable to the extraterrestrials and that has been demonstrated over and over however by the destruction of any nuclear weapon sent into space
was it early in the morning I received a call from my topside security guard he and some of the guards have been observing some strange lights flying around the launch control facility and I said well you mean UFO I think I use
that word you didn't know what they were but they were lights that were flying around I just kind of shook my head and said well call me if anything more important than happening he calls back and this time he's very frightened I can
tell by the tone of his voice he's very shook up and said sir there's a glowing red object hovering right outside the front gate as I was relating this to him
I missile started shutting down one by one the Air Force did an extensive investigation of the entire incident and was not able to come up with a probable cause for the shutdowns that the missiles are not connected to each other
having a fault at one side would not affect missiles at another location assuming they've always been there but what caused this great interest in us is logic cushion after 47 arrive every thought from that missile will obviously yes to happen book or one of the half
stage 132 tons ballistic device now fully operational after an evolutionary background of more than 50 years of powered plane Roswell was not the beginning it was a turning point we just got to bounds on a country we had a test
of that bomb a few months earlier a few weeks earlier in New Mexico this probably was observed by these aliens somewhere whether they were doing two reconnaissance back then or how they have figured it out so they came here to
observe and try to figure out what the heck was that at the time of the crash shortly after the detonation of the first atomic weapons
Roswell was the only nuclear-armed squadron in the world if you accept a multi-dimensional theory it's highly likely we've got a hell of a lot of damage in somebody else's world and by we've done more damage though engineer
the underlying theme that connects most of the disclosure project Case Files is the fact that these Close Encounters tend to occur near our nuclear facilities suggesting that these visitors are deeply concerned with our hostility and the existential threat that we pose to ourselves and others
once we learned to split the atom these are some of the highest-ranking military officials in our defense program they're trusted with you know nuclear weapons they're trusted with top-level security clearances and seizures but the minute that they start talking about this
particular subject they become pariah I believe the American people are entitled to a more thorough explanation than has been given them by the Air Force I think we owe it to the people to establish credibility regarding UFOs and to
produce the greatest possible enlightenment of the subject former
President Gerald Ford I am prepared to state that I have been at locations where craft of unknown origin that did not originate on the face of this planet was there I am prepared to state that while I was there we saw living dead
bodies of entities that were not born on this planet I am prepared to state that we had what they referred to as interfacing with those entities never is there any compelling physical evidence the question is who are people like Carl Sagan and before him professor
Donald Menzel it turns out that Sagan in his early career actually spoke and wrote about UFOs in a way that was affirmative there was a legitimate after he was threatened by the intelligence community and blackmailed he then began to debunk the issue
skepticism is very healthy and I'm a big skeptic about more than 90% of the information out there on the subject which the public needs to be skeptical however skepticism is not just blindly denying everything that's legitimate for
example we have 3500 cases where extraterrestrial vehicles have landed in less physical traces we have 4,000 cases where they have been tracked on radar and seen by pilots we have an enormous amount of photo and video evidence and physical evidence and in our last
project brought out an actual body that is most likely not of human origin so the question becomes what is the metric for the evidence well the evidence is actually overwhelming there's more evidence for UFOs and there are four
black holes most of the theories in astrophysics most of the evidence for most of the medicines you take I'm speaking now as a trauma doctor and yet we have this blockage in the mainstream median scientific establishment saying where is the evidence what do we know we
know now we live in an ever-expanding universe we know that there are billions of stars and planets literally out there and the universe is getting bigger we know from our fancy telescopes that just in the last two years more than 20
planets have been identified outside our solar system that seem to be far enough away from their Suns and dense enough that they might be able to support some form of life so it makes it increasingly less likely that we're alone oh you're
trying to give me a hint that there are aliens of course flying saucers are real and they are interplanetary Air Chief
Marshal Lord doubting I was eight or nine I saw one of these objects broad daylight there was a beautiful seamless disc in a blue sky back when the skies were very blue and I was with some boys in the neighborhood and we saw this I
went they're real we saw you a phone on my parents at oh well you're just a kid but
I became completely absorbed in this so my interest in this goes back to my childhood the disclosure project was an accident of history in 1990 I formed the
Center for the Study of extraterrestrial intelligence to form a diplomatic core to make peaceful contact with these civilizations because once you conclude that they're real and they're of interstellar origin the next question is what are we going to do about it and so
I concluded what we should be doing about it is not militarized in the relationship like having sort of a citizen's diplomacy effort much like the physicians for Social Responsibility who are going to the Soviet Union to create a dialogue during the coldest days of
the Cold War there was no one at the
United Nations or State Department or any foreign ministry dealing with it so we started a set of protocols to make contact and sure enough we had some spectacular successes holy damn hot shit okay this got kicked up to the
intelligence community so by 1992 I was getting visits from the head of army intelligence of people inside the National Security Agency and other three-letter agencies my intention was never to get involved with trying to disclose this issue my interest was in
this whole concept of making contact for peaceful purposes to advance our civilization from a planetary civilization to an interplanetary civilization that was that was really the heart of my my sincere interest but along that way you know and eventually a man who is friends
with the director of the CIA by the time Clinton became president who said you're going to be the first person to brief the director of Central
Intelligence and the Clinton administration on this because they have made inquiries and they have been lied to which I did not believe I mean he was that blunt about it this is really where
I then went down the rabbit hole
so can the government keep a secret this big one of the biggest weapon in the intelligence community's arsenal is our general belief that the US government couldn't possibly keep a secret this big from the American public but the
existence of the National Reconnaissance
Office remain secret for over 30 years the mere existence of the NFS jokingly referred to as no such agents was kept secret until it grew so large that it was quite conspicuous and those working in the Manhattan Project developing the
atom bomb we're told that any secrets that they disclose would result in 10 years in prison or an equivalent of $100,000 fine only when the weapons were used at
Hiroshima and Nagasaki did the government disclose what they were of all things to keep secret the fact that there is this this bountiful option that we have of reaching out into the
Stars and being friendly neighbors with other civilizations and sharing information sharing resources and sharing knowledge and sharing spiritual insights and values to suppress that information and do conceal it is part of the efforts of a national security state that is threatened by that reality and
so that this is the one of the ultimate secrets that needs to be exposed we have indeed been contacted perhaps even visited by extraterrestrial beings and the US government in collusion with the other national powers of the earth is
determined to keep this information from the general public
Victor Marchetti former special assistant to the executive director of the CIA and in this document from the
Canadian government the matter is the most highly classified subject in United
States government rating higher than the
H fund that was the most top-secret doomsday weapon at the time in development and the second item be flying saucers exist period see their modus operandi is unknown but concentrated effort is being made by a small group headed by dr. ban of our
Bush and then D the entire matter is considered by the United States authorities to be a tremendous significant what is more sensitive than the development of the hydrogen bomb prior to its detonation the UFO issued a priori therefore the entire subject has
been managed in a way from the 40s onward with extraordinary secrecy around it the event at Roswell because it resulted in the acquisition of material that could be studied it created a sea change in the whole national security organization because within weeks of
that event the CIA was sent within weeks there was the formation of the Air Force which was split off from the Army Air Force it also led however the development of unacknowledged special access projects which is why
Eisenhower even though he knew about the subject on a fairly deep level had completely lost control of it by 1961 when he left office we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military-industrial complex
you know because you think of generals and you think of conservatives and
Republicans as being very Pro military and business but he's talking about the illegal part of it he's not talking about the conventional military but it's now the military industrial intelligence and complex that are moving bureaucratically toward establishing
Dominion control over the entire democratic process in the country and that they're waging war invading the
Middle Eastern oil fields and occupying the oil fields attempting to establish what they themselves referred to as full spectrum dominance but we're gonna smoke them out and so the public has to understand there became to be this bifurcation that this separation between
legitimate national security and military operations and the deep black programs that are unacknowledged we're talking about the black budget the deep black super secret unacknowledged budget that runs in the hundred to two hundred billion dollars a year I'm being
conservative my oh three budget calls for more than 48 billion dollars in new defense spending more money for the
Pentagon when its own auditors admit the military cannot account for 25 percent of what it already spends according to some estimates we cannot track 2.3 trillion dollars in transactions two point three trillion with a tea that's eight thousand dollars for every man
woman and child in America we're spending well over a hundred million dollars per day on classified program that have no congressional oversight no public scrutiny there's no monitor these programs a number of these programs go directly through Congress totally we start going
through these documents these programs start dropping off the radar screen these are all classified programs within the defense budget but they don't supply any technical information on the program and if people think that the Congress and the president actually have a handle
on this they're gravely mistaken they do not this is where we get into the structure of secrecy the structure of secrecy is complex and multifaceted we've been led to be that we live in a mostly transparent democracy with the
president at the top of the intelligence food chain a true commander in chief the reality is much done a shadowy government with its own Air Force its own Navy his own fundraising mechanism and the ability to pursue his own ideas
of the national interest free from all checks and balances and free from the law itself there's secrecy that is legal and unfortunately where Edward Snowden made his mistake was by disclosing secrets no matter how inappropriate it might have
been that they were going on that were being managed legally that the president in Congress and the intelligence committees knew about a traitor a traitor to the United States on the other hand their secrecy that is ill legal and these are the unacknowledged
special access projects use that's us AP for short what they've done is they've formed this alliance among themselves of the industry that makes money by building war machines the military that uses the war machines and justifies them
and then the intelligence community that is not really intelligence when it's a covert operations community armed with military weapons and nuclear weapons in that they're trying to push the boundaries now of establishing their
Dominion in full spectrum dominance over the planet and in this document first document that's on the briefing for
President Obama's briefly put together that we gave to John Podesta this document lists the compartmented operations out of the Nellis facility what the public wrongly calls area 51 I gave this document to the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Admiral Tom Wilson now this is j2 this is the guy who puts the intelligence briefings together for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United
States of America and he got hold of one of these compartments and he said hello
I'm Admiral Tom Wilson I want to be read into or briefed on this project they said yes sir we know who you are and you don't have a need to know you don't have a need to know the head of intelligence
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff so this is where the military had been victims of the secrecy because there are many generals and admirals and very good officers I've met with who have enormous responsibilities that everyone if you
hold a thousand people on the street I think every single person would say something this sensitive they would know about and if they didn't have knowledge about it if they asked about it they will be told that is not true there are
very clear efforts to engage in covert programs and to keep the knowledge of those programs away from people even in positions of constitutional authority
Dick Cheney he would ever need to know they call him dark King we're talking about people way up in the defense industry people who are running this complex people like Ben rich like Kelly Johnson so these unacknowledged special access projects
do not care what your ranking position is they care about one thing will you go along with their agenda and this is exactly what happened when I met with the Lord Hill north since my name has become connected with UFO matters in
quite a big way in this country I have frequently been asked by a person of my background or former chief of the
Defence Staff a former chairman of the major military committee what the reasons may be for governments wishing to cover up the facts about UFOs that I believe is because government said that if they did discuss the fact people would penny
the only thing he really wanted to know was sedatives Ministry of Defence head of the Military Committee for NATO head of mi5 mi6 why wouldn't they have told me and I said well Sir with all due respect what would you have done if huge
found out that there was a project that was Iligan engaged in assassinations that was keeping from not only our leaders and our constitutionally required oversight technologies and information that would enable us have a whole new civilization on this planet
without pollution or dependency on
Mideast oil or what happened and he said
I would step forward bloody minute and he was just in a rage about it I said several US presidents are on record talking about the UFO mystery presidents
Jimmy Carter Ronald Reagan both had UFO sightings of their own but the current presidential campaign might be the first in which UFO disclosure has been championed by a major party candidate we had your husband President Clinton on this show he said I asked him about UFOs
in the area 51 and if you if he looked in because if I was president that's the first thing I do I go right into those files is right what was going on right and he said that he did do that yes and
that he didn't find anything well oh I'm done I'm going to do it again yeah why not right and you know there's a new name it's unexplained aerial phenomenon unexplained aerial phenomena that really yep you ap that's the latest
nomenclature I like the old one I like
UFO I don't know what within a couple months of me briefing the CIA director I get a visit from one of Bill Clinton's good friends to my home who says they love what you're recommending that the
president do executive orders to declassify and bring all this information out this man comes to my house and says they really think that's a great idea president won't do it it's too dangerous and I said well he's the president
didn't want to be president shouldn't taken on the responsibility and sworn an oath to the Constitution and he says yeah but you don't understand they don't think that they can protect the
President and I said what do you need and he sitting at the dinner table with my children and he says well their concerns note that President Clinton will end up like Jack Kennedy and I start laughing I really I mean I really
started laughing out loud because I thought this is nonsense this is like conspiracy Cookeville he says no this is absolutely their concern is that if he pushes on this he is in mortal peril because they may have been engaged in a
bit of a struggle with the CIA if I attempted to get more information on the
UFO subject that might account for his termination and that morning in two of the english-speaking newspapers there was a picture of two UFOs so I had placed those on his table where he was going to be sitting and I said good
morning mr. president
Sam Dallas said we'd like to have coffee and juice and insidious so while I was getting that he's looking at the papers
I came back in President Kennedy says what do you think I looked at him I looked down at the picture and I said well sir what do you think and with that magnificent grin of this he said I asked you first
I said what I've learned we can't be the only living beings in God's creation he says you're right young man there is considerable knowledge as far as the actual being of UFO and et phenomenon that we're aware of
today I am convinced that UFOs exist because I've seen one President Jimmy
Carter when President Carter was elected
I was the legal counsel for the Jesuit national headquarters in Washington DC he called the director of the Central
Intelligence Agency George HW Bush to a meeting and asked Bush if as he has the director of Central Intelligence would give to Carter's the president-elect all the information he had on the potential existence of extraterrestrial life and the issue of whether or not any of the
UFO vehicles might be vehicles from another star system and George HW Bush refused to give him of the information said he'd have to go to Congress and get
Congress to have the Congressional
Research Service of the Library of
Congress declassify it to get into it if he was good again that's that's true story in some of these cases absolutely the president has no needed no because he's a temporary employee he's strictly a temporary employee he does not have a
need-to-know on some of these deeper black programs within the skunk works within the Boeing phantom works and also within the Black Widow group of Northrop
Congressional Research Service or the
Library of Congress their science technology division based on all the information classified and Declassified that they have reviewed that their projection was that there were at least from two to six other highly intelligent highly technologically developed but non-human civilizations
just in our Milky Way galaxy there was deep concern that something that important would be kept out of the briefings for the president my sort of coming of age which was hard
anyway it's we're talking about this hmm trying to say I was young doctor asked to do something like this I'm a doctor in the ER taking care of shootings and stabbings and heart wreck and I'm being
asked to brief the CIA director on stuff because he and the president are being lied to what you know are you I could be fuckin crazy it was terrible if it frankly was devastating initially I have to admit the CI
director I thought to be honest with you that he was sort of picking my brain to find out what I knew as opposed to really not knowing like time three hour meeting was over it was quite clear that the Emperor had no clue
he later denied the meeting it happened for a briefing this is a wonderful thing now people say how could he write this letter basically saying that this meeting and what I said about it was a distortion of the truth I said because
he didn't realize there was a record before him and thank God
I saved the document that is the original invitation and in the Fed lever it is explicit I talk to Wolsey this morning and he suggested getting together there is an active attempt being made lower levels of government sabotage and project starlight which is
the initiative I started and Laurance
Rockefeller held fun to bring all these top secret people together and recommend these changes to the something that's fiction and then he says this group almost certainly has tapped your phones and is aware of most of the details of your
plan remember the most powerful people in the world will have a deep compelling interest in our activities and will use everything at their disposal to affect their objectives yeah I saw all come on this is like a bad you know conspiracy novel except
this became my life I just became the first president to ever publicly mention area 51
I was actually based upon what the Jimmy
Carter has said and based upon what Bill
Clinton has said that they were refused this information I believe that is unconstitutional for them to refuse to give the information at the present stage many of the disclosure project witness have had a close encounter with another facet of the structure of
secrecy people who did not agree with this extraordinary secrecy and made trouble for them ended up having horrific things happen he was talking about being erased and I said now it's what do you mean erased he said yes he said you
will be erased if you tell anyone who is not in this room about this project this bullet has your name on it and it will find you let's just have the intestines I agencies to terminate people who are who are peers to being
comedians on top of some answer nine too much but that is all the time after I told this story but I continue to tell the story because it's important for people to understand this sort of shit goes on in the government that the
government covers up information that we are entitled to know about it citizens in the century he'll go after not only you and said you'll go after your family they were like looking and we're going to worse when I just we're going to take
you off my covers kick your ass off out of I don't know jungle image we're going to end you all this they were never there this never happened when I asked them at the time I don't know why you're saying
there's a minute if there was something there and if it's not the stealth-bomber then you know for UFO and if it's UFO why wouldn't you want to as the people know all to go outside over that the
only one sails woods and there were been dozens and dozens of totally absolutely important credible people who had their careers ruined intentionally by the national security democracy because they tried to come forward and fulfill what they do to be there their duty to report
this to their superiors Jayhawk in the morning four o'clock in the morning midnight ten o'clock people call and first screaming laughing oh I diabetic
Hungary is going down motherfucker Nina said that Percy's don't go in scared any revolution Russell's nothing now they're who do you tell that you were involved in a UFO internet without the look ahead you like you ain't
wrapped too tight one night somebody blew up my mailbox by putting a big load of skyrockets in it the mailbox went up in flames and that night want to clock in the morning the phone rang I picked it up in
somebody said skyrocketing in the box at night so would you suffice motherfucker interestingly there was a man on my
Executive Committee was a very well-known actor and singer named burl ives and borough life he was a 33rd degree Mason so all of you people who think that all these secret societies everyone in it knows everything I don't
know anything and he said to me he says we all know that Marilyn Monroe didn't die above overdose boopadoo he said do you know why they killed
Marilyn that's better the lake now in the row and I said well I didn't until I got this document it's a virtual death warrant because she was found a couple days later three August 1962 wiretap of
telephone conversations between reporter
Dorothy Kilgallen who was looking into
Roswell and other UFO issues and her close friend Howard lost birth from wiretap of telephone conversation of
Marilyn Monroe and attorney general
Bobby Kennedy Rothberg discussed the apparent comeback of the subject with
Kilgallon and the breakup with the
Kennedys this is referring to the fact that Marilyn Monroe had been having an affair was not one but both Kennedy brothers and it was becoming conspicuous so they broke it off Rosberg indicated in so many words that she had secrets to
tell no doubt arising from her trysts with the president and the Attorney
General once that secret mentions the visit of the president at a secret air base for the purpose of inspecting things from outer space now this is 1962 to gone said if the story is true it would be a terrible embarrassment for
Jackie and his plans to have Manson we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard such a repeatedly called the Attorney
General and complained about the way she was being ignored by the President and his brother subject threatened to hold a press conference and would tell all it's a tragic situation because she was an actress she didn't understand the
national security state and the viciousness of those who want to keep these sort of secret that's very I won't let it happen you reveal all the secrets and strict control over it now you know there are a lot of people that are going
to examine your your facial expressions here every every twitch everything and say and of course so did you look did you see did you exploit I can't reveal anything oh really because President Clinton said he did go riding and he did check and there was
nothing well you know that's that's what we're instructed to say one of the most powerful elements of the structure of secrecy has to do with the infiltration and control over mainstream media
corporations patty a state chairman just rocks written out some good old treaties they own networks from psst they can use them to say whatever they breathe and put down the imbalances of anyone who did live we observed firsthand the intelligence community
influencing the media when they're trying to cover this story we have memoranda after memoranda after memoranda citing the psychological warfare and propaganda value of the subject this is a very important thing for the public to understand how do you
keep something secret be hiding in plain sight and I suspect that unless the
Defense Department proves us otherwise that it was probably a some form of an alien spacecraft I think as a public figure you have to be very careful about what you say because of people can have pretty emotional reactions and and I
said my goal wasn't to try to stir the pot and now I'll ask officer Stein and his colleagues to escort the accused into the room so that we may all look upon the guilty party don't get in too
close to me please Envy alien announced to the governor's chief of staff this just goes to show that you guys are entirely too serious so it's there everyone I mean there's five percent of
US population of seeing these objects but you create an environment where the subject is so pilloried and ridiculed that no respectable scientist or doctor would want to be identified with it internal documents or the Defense
Department intelligence agencies explicitly stating that they they want to have this campaign of ridiculing and destroying the credibility of completely credible completely honest eyewitnesses to UFO sightings and even sightings of extraterrestrial beings on the ground that they want them discredited they
want their credibility destroyed if someone comes out and says I saw a UFO on TV the only ones that see a UFO and the TV programs are the rednecks out in the country that that are going Coon hunting or alligator on at night you
don't find anybody with any kind of spots or some professional individuals saying eh last night let me tell you I saw and this officially was released by the CIA talking about how they have people embedded in all the major media to
change alter and affect stories to their benefit you are faked is so every news agency every television radio station and the Albuquerque Santa Fe area had our snitches in there so we knew and we paid we paid good money one of the
reasons with the people who's paying and and that was controversial that was somewhat controversial you know national media hood had also yes yes yeah I'm not in a name we now have relationships with reporters from every underlined major
wire service newspaper news weekly and television networks in the nation in many instances we have persuaded reporters to postpone change hold or even scrap stories that could have adversely affected national security interest or jeopardized our sources and methods and it goes on to then to say
that they have the same within academic circles there's a finding that the right committee made that they have verified
42 full-time Central Intelligence Agency paid employees that were inserted inside the major national news media centers and most of them ended up being the so-called national security reporters Adam and turned to me and this is a board member of time-life and said dr.

Fourth Estate is dead you know reporters are Time magazine who told me specifically that they've provided the stories and their editors have spiked them yeah the high level producers and directors yeah and we're they how are they paid
cash paid what you do is you make them sign a form and you tell them you got to put this IRS but whether they do it or not you're not going to give your form to IRS I paid I paid I better not say
there were some of them are large if you is McClain no of any proof about aliens you can give it to me I guarantee you I will get it out but I am skeptical based upon my experience representing NBC and
in representing new york times i know that they will refuse to publish information which in my judgment is clearly important information for the public to know the corruption of the media means that you have been undermined democracy and our basic
constitutional protections because if you control the information flow through the elite media and the only place you can get this information is through the tabloids where they want it prose its discredit in there or on the internet where there's so much false information
that's mixed in with the real information that you don't know what to make of it there creates this complete confusion when you go to a supermarket checkout and you look at the tabloids what you may be reading there are actual
stories of actual events but when it's portrayed through the tabloids it gets discredited in their ridicule their careers are destroyed pursuant to a very specific self-conscious official program now this has worked for 50 years why would they change it now this is the
technique they've used it is time for the truth to be brought out behind the scenes high ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFOs but through official secrecy and ridicule many citizens are led to believe the
unknown flying objects are nonsense
I urge immediate congressional action to reduce the dangers from secrecy about unidentified flying objects CIA director
Vice Admiral Roscoe Halen and so we're sort of living in a Truman Show everyone thinks we have a free press we don't we have a democratic process where all these sort of sensitive issues will be handled legally we do not and that we
have an uncorrupted scientific establishment which we do not and which we will prove the structure of secrecy extends to the scientific and academic arena where a deliberate effort to spread disinformation has been going on for decades from professional debunkers
to CIA funded committees our trusted academics and scientists have been complicit in the secrecy a lot of people see something and a lot of people see things that are really they can't identify but that doesn't mean they were
it's quite a leap I believe that people report seeing things they cannot identify but I after spending 25 years
I've found not a shred of evidence that we have alien visitors in our sky look look this could be the greatest discovery in the history of science NASA would be elated of course they'd go to
Congress get more funding why would anybody ever decide let's do it let's do let's do this other little thought experiment everybody so you're going to do this with baking soda and vinegar bill in 1952 Project Blue Book was
launched by the US Air Force to allay fears from the public TP activity and to assure them that they were doing everything in their power to look into it I am here to discuss the so-called flying saucers air force interest in
this problem then due to our feeling of an obligation to identify and analyze to the best of our ability anything in the air that may have the possibility of threat or menace to the United States there has been a decision named within
the national security state infrastructure the ridicule and dismiss cases that they know titli are cases of genuine sightings of
UFOs and extraterrestrial beings that's perfectly clear Project Blue Book was headed up by dr.

Ohio State University
Hynek eventually came clean and said he were there to debunk these cases not to get the truth until the public and I know the the job they had they were told not to excite the public don't rock the
boat and I saw it in my own eyes happened that whenever a case happened that they could explain which is quite a few they made point of that and then let that out to the media cases that were very difficult to explain they would
jump ahem Springs too cheap through the media away from they had a job to do to keep the public from getting excited however there been a certain percentage of this volume of report that had been made by credible observers of relatively
incredible things it is this group of observations that we now are attempting to resolve in response to project blue an academic committee was formed in 1953 called the
Robertson panel comprised of some of the most respected physicists and astronomers of the day the Robertson panel was tasked with providing a fair and independent academic analogy of the
UFO case and in this document it says point-blank that the people who are on this committee are answering and working with the CIA but that can't be disclosed and these are esteemed scientists in academic university settings it says
point-blank when there's a very strong piece of evidence we need to set up something so we release certain types of balloons and film it so that it will look like that to sort of debunk it and we need to engage astronomers and
amateur astronomers and set up a sighting situation where we show them some evidence and then show them how its debunked fast-forward to 1968 the conmen committee was formed led by dr.

Condon a professor of physics at the
University of Colorado now ostensibly this was an objective scientist who was heading up a committee to tell the truth because I'm a scientist these guys are scientists second they're humans first and it says it cannot be allowed to be known that dr.

mcdonnell who was at that time the the chairman of the newly merged Douglas and
McDonald pet craft companies and tried to get me fired this is in these documents it is this is not a theoretical case this is why I say you form a committee when you want to kill something
I must admit that any favorable mention of the flying saucers by a scientist amounts to extreme heresy and places the one making the statement in danger of excommunication by the scientific theocracy Frank B Salzburg PhD
and from the very first meeting I had with the director of Central
Intelligence I didn't need to convince him that the UFOs were real I mean in fact I pulled out all the dispositive evidence that Carl Sagan would want to see and he said I already know this is real but I want to know why I the CIA
director james Woolsey and the President of the United States aren't being told anything about it the why is always the hardest question to ask and nobody asks it and I began to explain to him what it really is is a big technological
question we have lost a hundred years of evolution on planet Earth a true loss century huge progress was made in the
1920s as Nikola Tesla developed energy generation technologies that could power the earth drawing endless free energy from the so called empty space around so-called empty space is it really empty at all it's actually full of energy so instead
of being like kind of a quiet empty lake that's more like the froth of the base of the waterfall the amount of energy and cubic meter of space time was 10 to the 26th power so 10 with 26 zeroes
behind in joules per cubic meter and that's enough energy even in a coffee cup to boil all the oceans of the earth completely away into steam the acronym unidentified flying object is a deliberately obfuscating term and what it really is is an alternative
energy and propulsion system they had that piece of they thought with
Plexiglas a rectangle piece of Plexiglas four years before they figured out it was the energy device for the craft and it was connected in such a manner that this device could power a very small watch up to a city power was determined
by what the demand on it was and so each craft had one of these the implications of free energy go far beyond keeping the lights on in your home or running your car without gasoline most of the costs of making anything from
growing food to constructing a skyscraper is the energy used to mine the raw materials out of the ground ship process ship again package and deliver a free energy society in which the cost of manufacturing and agriculture moved towards zero would mean endless
abundance for every they already exist it's not like they even have to be invented you and I the taxpayers have already paid trillions of dollars literally in super secret black budget funding to develop these systems this is the Society we could have had a century
ago we could get rid of smog we can get rid of pollution you wouldn't even need solar panels at this point we could change transportation in a microsecond the way we build homes would be completely different the way we go in
our lives would be completely different and all the literally hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets that are in cold natural gas uranium nuclear power Public Utilities they're all obsolete many people would say well doesn't that mean the secrecy has been a
good thing I said well that would be like saying we should have never come out with the automobile because the horse and buggy manufacturers were going out of business or come out with computers because royal typewriters didn't get ahead of the curve and they
went out of business when we go outside and look at our cars we look at our airplanes we're already looking at dinosaur technology it's laughable where we are right now we should be at least a hundred years ahead of where we are
right now and they're still files on this issue classified top secret from
100 years ago for the same reason because the macroeconomic order of fossil fuels petrodollar handful of industrial elite and corporations be completely transformed folks who actually call the shot in the multi trillion-dollar global economy they don't want to see that happen they
know that if that power was you know delineated to the average person we wouldn't need them anymore they don't want it today and the likes of JP Morgan and others back a hundred years ago didn't want it when they found out that
Tesla had passed away in the hotel New
Yorker they came in they had the manager of the hotel opened the safe and they took all of Tesla's papers and this was to the director of the FBI from the
Department of Defense and a turf war trying to get that information and to lock it up this is not a contested document this has been officially released a century of artificial scarcity has produced a destabilized dehumanized war-torn world where the
power and wealth have been transferred from the many to the hands of a few if you take that on you're going to run into the mother of all buzz saws in terms of the national security state some of the breakthroughs in the past
have been deliberately suppressed there were 5135 I believe it is patents that have been confiscated under national security seizures now these are just a pen and this is what happened to a lot of the huge breakthrough technologies like dan Meyer
who had a car running on water a local inventor has discovered a way here this they use water to hide your car it's a major breakthrough that will no doubt make motorists happy energy on
Robinson explains the Pentagon is also showing lots of interest in this project a lot of people don't realize that Dan
Meyer had a toroidal a doughnut shaped object that put out many times more energy than you had to put into it because it was tapping into this zero point quantum vacuum energy field that had a national-security on order on it
before he even got it to patent it was seized and shut down what we really had was a threat to the scientific establishment love you this is the greatest strategic threat to survival of the United States and in fact of civilization itself who's
going to stop this from happening the president doesn't know it's occurring the Congress oversight committees have no idea what's going on and you have these people who are in the deep national security state who basically do
what they want the problem is most of these inventors think that the world is going to be two paths to their door unfortunately murder incorporated beats a pass through their door first but free energy technology was only one half of
the equation when it came to advanced extraterrestrial technology early research into anti-gravity technology gained momentum in the 1940s as Adolf
Hitler poured tremendous resources into developing his secret weapon the so called flying bell once we acquired these technologies they were augmented with the study of retrieved extraterrestrial crafts and we created our own fleet of so-called alien reproduction vehicles this is where Bell Labs was involved
this is where General Electric was involved this is where a number of high tech companies gained their knowledge
Lockheed Martin scuf works and EGG and
Raytheon and East Systems and mitre corporation and Booz Allen Hamilton and on and on and on I know many people who've worked in these programs quote we have things flying in a Nevada desert that are 50 years beyond what you could
comprehend if you've seen it on Star
Wars or Star Trek we've been there done that or decided it wasn't worth the effort so that's coming from been rich been rich headed the skunk looks between
1975 and 1991 this is the original letter from Ben rich on Lockheed advanced aeronautics company letterhead
I am a believer and so is Kelly Johnson here it says dear Ben there are two categories a man made you a be extraterrestrial UFOs Dear John yes
I'm a believer in both categories I feel everything is possible many of our manmade UFOs were unfunded opportunities in both categories there are lots of creeps and charlatans be cautious been rich we now have the technology to take e.t home been rich
CEO Lockheed skunkworks it is being covered up but probably not for the reasons you might think within the intelligence communities they have something called ace in the hole technologies so secret they didn't even talk about it
November 12th of 1988 was there dog and pony show a classified military exhibit at Norton Air Force Base and then off in a separate section of the hangar behind a curtain which was opened up once everyone had gathered were three of
these so-called alien reproduction vehicles or a RVs the craft itself was hovering off the floor with no landing gear underneath had nothing supporting it from above to see something you know travel across twelve miles of airspace and under a second and a half make a
couple of right angle turns and not make a supersonic shock wave of any kind no sonic boom which I've personally witnessed on a number of occasions I mean it's just it changes your whole perspective there were some very good
folks like secretary Forrestal and others who wanted to bring the subject out but in a way where there would be contact that would be peaceful between humans and these civilizations but there were other people who saw the big goldmine of militarism and war
profiteering and the psychological warfare value their mandate repeat their mandate is to lie deny and deceive there are people who have had experiences with the technology that were not able to handle it psychologically because it just defies reality and in this document
the CIA director Walter Smith says I am today transmitting to the National
Security Council a proposal in which it is concluded that the problem is connected with unidentified flying objects appear to have implications for psychological warfare as well as for intelligence and operations but to take a step back from all the jargon and all the paranoia and
Star Wars movies for just a minute and realize that it's very easy to set up a false flag operation a false flag operation also known as a false indication and warning is a military tactic in which you create the illusion
of a planet often by attacking yourself and blaming the desired edit it's proven extremely effective at uniting the public around a perceived right and this is actually a well known concept in military intelligence circles we did it in the Gulf of Tonkin in Vietnam where
we exaggerated if not completely staged an attack on our naval vessels so we would Stampede President Johnson in the
Congress and to vastly expanding the
Vietnam conflict to benefit guess who the military-industrial complex and the war profiteers US military official example for have planned to a pressure called Operation Northwoods back in 1962 to dress up a Cuban refugees in Cuban military uniforms have them attack
Guantanamo base and kill US military personnel sink our US military ships in blow up shopping centers in Miami targeting killing refugees from Cuba to infuriate the American population so that they can invade and occupy Cuba it's astonishing that anybody would
Guerra to make a recommendation like that but they did then you can look at
Iraq concocted all kinds of false information about weapons of mass destruction which suddam Hussein did not have and it was known in intelligence circles he didn't have fracture that whole part of the world and now we have
Isis so we have to realize the machination and manipulation that go on behind sames leave us very vulnerable and a big one is this one where they could say oh yes the UFOs are real but guess what they're a threat and we need to be night
the world like Will Smith said in the original independent state something you want to add to this briefing captain
Hillier no sir just likes to get up there whoopee teas as that's all efforts on the part of a certain element within the kind of ruling structures of our planet to try to utilize the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence as an
ultimate threat the ultimate other bad guys to justify the national security state dream of locking down in putting under complete control of an authoritarian ruling class to control the planet and the resources the nations of the world will have to unite for the
next war will be an interplanetary war the nations of the earth must someday make a common front against attack by people from other planets General
Douglas MacArthur can you realize that we zat you and I but all of us have actually begun the exploration of another world we have taken the first historic step into our solar system I am
Werner von Braun Verner von Braun was one of the top scientists brought to the u.s. from Germany after World War two as part of Operation Paperclip he invented the v2 rocket for a rocket and became the chief architect of the Saturn 5
rocket for NASA's Apollo moon missions in his deathbed confession von Braun warned of a plot to pull off the ultimate false flag using that engineered alien reproduction vehicle to stage an invasion from space when von Braun was dying in front
of me the very first day that I met him he had tubes draining out of his side and he was tapping on the desk telling me you will come to Fairchild I was a schoolteacher you will come to Fairchild
and you will be responsible for keeping weapons out of space the strategy that
Wernher von Braun taught me was that first the Russians were the enemy against whom were going to build space-based weapons then terrorists would be identified then we were going to identify third world country crazies the last card is the alien card all of
it he said is a lie a lie have you been exposed or did you come across in your career and your network the false signs of you or the deceptive indication and warnings projects related to this yes and what did you find out about those um
that's pretty clad that's pretty much that's I don't think I should talk about that yeah let me that broke my grief the head of intelligence agency that was the main soldier that is yeah that's very
sensitive yeah it's very sensitive yeah
I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world
well the only problem with that is that if you look at the technologies that permit for interplanetary interstellar travel it's a thousand times more developed than a hydrogen bomb which if we were to have a massive exchange of
nuclear weapons would leave most of all life on Earth extinguished therefore how could we possibly have armed conflict with another planetary system for more than a nanosecond and survive it they know that we couldn't but it's a way of manipulating the
public through demagoguery of fear jingoism false nationalism and creating a boogeyman out in space were you surprised and you're not enlisted not at all she's a born leader I know I've been taking orders from her since he was 5
years old you don't worry about it of course I worry about her I fought in the war in 96 I know what those things are capable of but I know what my daughter is capable of and I know this
planet is safer because she's defending it
they could pull it off they could definitely pull it out right now they have the technology to mimic the form fit and function of extraterrestrial
UFOs they have the technology absolutely it's seamless and you can never tell the difference if they do have a false flag invasion they're going to use one of these this is the Hudson Valley boomerang this is 1982 to 1989 over
25,000 eyewitnesses reported this craft they can use these saucers the cigars the pyramids the triangles as a United coalition and that's how they're going to do it we're talking about 150 to 170 two feet across for the wingspan which
is the identical wingspan of the b-2 stealth bomber so the question we need to ask is was some of that twenty-two point four billion used on the beach according to this program it's the exact same time frame when they power up and
when they accelerate it looks like a spark off a grinding wheel and you could never know the difference so if they wanted to hoax an alien invasion they could do it and they could do it in a way that's a hundred percent they
started doing all kinds of psychological warfare and Trainmen to the public by staging hoaxed events such as cattle mutilations oh it's a flying saucer did that the covert paramilitary program human so if you wanted to start indoctrinated into a false threat from
outer space that Wernher von Braun warned us about you would start staging events that look alien but that are completely man-made that are scary and scare the hell out of people
UFO encounters are categorized into four groups close encounters of the Fourth
Kind include people who claim to have been abducted by extraterrestrials if you had a close encounter of the Fourth
Kind and you are back we're anxious to hear from you enter stage left you got the sort of anti-gravity devices with creatures that look like ETS that are actually man-made robotic systems they're called program life-forms and you start doing select
interfaces with the public we did do that yes OSI did that there was a special group out of the 7600 second ear
Intel wing at Fort Belvoir they came out and did that they had these people they had maybe some sort of defects and phenomenal effects that were brought brought in to fool people and thinking they're aliens yeah I can't give you any
specifics because it's the program is so classified and they probably still doing it I wouldn't doubt dot it they were still doing it till they've already got this psychological warfare already embedded into the minds of people to
expect an extraterrestrial not a secret aircraft but an alien craft so when they do pull this they'll already have everything ready to roll these civilians got onto the base and got into something they saw something they weren't supposed
to see and this group came out and went into their home and scared the Dickens out of them and stays amalia that exactly the government will use the extra-terrestrial phenomenon to cover their own deep black programs and so that's the fight that we're
and then it makes it out through the movie industry and the UFO lore and the internet and what have you and it starts creating the specter of a threat get away from her you bitch Martin Lee are are you from Mars ever no move
me
the fact that you and I are still read in the free reverse is abundant testimony to their restraint and non hostility now the question is how are these civilizations viewing us are they perceiving human civilization as a threat and the answer is yes because I
believe we've reached the point where we're threat not only to our planet and each other but we're also developing weapon systems that are potentially a threat in space I just hope that is not like Independence Day yeah right that
it's a you know a conflict well now we have many other way to unite this incredibly divided world of ours they're out there we better think of how all the differences among people on earth would seem small if we felt
threatened by a space invader that's the whole theory of individual right I want to get together and makes nice and you know you and Bill O'Reilly would be hiding in a bunker together the most dangerous thing going on on the planet
today is in Isis it's not Iraq it's not Russia it's not China it's a out of control covert group that is not being overseen by the people the
Congress or the president who have developed these technologies and are recklessly using them to track and target extraterrestrial vehicles the result of this is that we're in a crisis that is unacknowledged ironically because these projects are unacknowledged what do you do you talk
to your Congressman do you write your senator do you march on the White House lawn what good is that going to do if the people who run this government don't have access to the program they're not cleared for it so that's just not the
direction to go we better not get this one wrong because this could be threat to all life on Earth if we are reckless with this issue we need wise elders that are humans dealing with this situation and associate pads
that are in control of those programs can't be allowed to steep for planet
Earth and for humanity resting power from the hand of these powerful oligarchs and corporation is going to require a revolution
you
when the more hopeful events have happened over the last decade was like all the French initiative I get a letter from the Ministry of Defense and it's dated 16th of January 2007 urgent and it's signed by Admiral Pierre Moran and
he was in charge of providing briefings on this issue for then president of the
French Republic
Sarkozy they learned protocols he made contact with these civilizations for peaceful engagement so here you have a major hunter a nuclear power making a commitment to do this and we eventually go to France and under the cover of a
cause a public event the Admiral and his assistants repair and we dealer from the protocols the context and they track et crap coming overhead at two hundred thousand dollars an hour but what it shows is that governments around the
world can actually do a lot if they wanted to to break the mold remote secrecy and do something helpful and this is the proof that that's happened with a major country this is arguably the most important UFO document in
history the irony of it is I couldn't disclose it for quite a while until that
President Sarkozy without office and these folks were not in harm's way there was a invitation extended from the
Vatican to some forty world scientists to come to Castle Gandolfo outside of
Rome where the Pontifical Observatory is and they spent a week briefing the highest level members of the Vatican they came out with an official press statement extraterrestrial life is going to be discovered much sooner than anybody had previously expected and for
this reason the time has now arrived for the beginning of a very serious discussion about the philosophical and theological questions they're posed to our human family by the discovery of extraterrestrial life there are civilizations that we need to
communicate with and I think we've reached that point in our evolution as a human race that we need to recognize that and the thing that disturbs me is that the u.s. is going to be a third world nation in in that field if we're
not careful by having all of the secrecy and refusing to set up any kind of diplomatic protocols as I know that you have called for and I believe in very strongly the biggest event in the history of humankind is the discovery
that we are not alone that there are other living entities intelligent entities in this universe or other universes and that we are here alone that's a huge enormous discovery I think it's long past time people from the
secular public give us information to the young people of the world in this country they want to hear it they want to give it all don't hide it and tell lies and make stories they're not stupid they're not young men little panic UFOs
are as real as the planes flying over your head and that it's time that the
United States government started coming clean on what it's all about because they're very important military and and economic issues that have to be addressed and how can you address the question which relates to a subject that people don't even exist real wanted milk
exists and it's a mission that we as the baby boomer generation pass our to you humanity is at a crossroads a choice between endless war war in space growing poverty and environmental destruction or a future where we explore the Stars live
in peace with each other and our planetary neighbors the technology is there the solutions earth urgent and long-term potential problems are there the technologies will change the macroeconomic system because visualize for a moment you're at your home all your power needs are being provided
