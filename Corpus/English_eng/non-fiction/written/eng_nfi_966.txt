- There she is.

All right, baby girl.

You go, baby girl.

Yes!
You're my baby...
No, no, no, don't make it.
Damn it!
Yes!
- Nope.

- I absolutely can't do it.

But remember, this is a stupid frat boy ritual, so...
Yeah, but kick their ass!
- Yeah, fuck 'em up!

- We're together.

Cool, cool, cool.
Yes.
Yeah, go, Jess!
Dude!
Oh, God.

Only two cups left.
No, there's one cup.

Oh, God!

- I can't do it.

- I can't do it, Jess.

Look at me.

You got us through the Wendy's drive-through when my car had no windshield and three tires.
You can do anything.
Yeah, but everybody's watching me, and I'm sweating like crazy.
I look like a princess, but I smell like a peasant.
Let's go, footjob girl!
Excuse me, she has a name!

And she's my best friend, and she's good and kind.
- Yeah!

Thank you, but I did jerk off his roommate with my feet.
I know.
The key is, right foot only for, like, a while.
- You know?

If we win this, we will be the only girls to ever win the Halloween tournament.
We've got to do this.
For womankind.
Stop making me horny, and shoot!
We did it!

- I want up!

You've earned it.
Here we go.

I'm the king of the world!
Again?
- Dude.

Are you all right?
- Oh, my God, are you okay?

- I'm fine, Mom.

What happened?
Honestly, I don't even know why we go to these stupid parties.
I just want to hang out with you guys.
- I know.

Everyone else at this college is sloppy and gross.
- Water.

Not bad.
- Who's grosser?

- What is that?

It's my vibrator, it randomly turns on and off.
Oh, my God, you guys, I'm gonna miss you so much next semester.
- I don't want to talk about it.

- No, no, no, no.

Al Gore is guest-lecturing next semester.
Maybe you don't want to go to Australia.

- Yeah.

I said I don't want to talk about it.
So I don't know what's happening.
I don't even want to go.

It was so hard to get into the political science program.
And plus, my gym class is bungee jumping, so...
Oh, my God, wear a good bra.
Well, look, we'll have all of senior year together, and then we'll have the rest of our lives together, so it's fine.
- Yeah.

You guys, our kids are gonna play together.
- Oh, my God!

- We're so lucky!

- Okay, that is a second vibrator.

Just...

- No!

- No!

- Come on.

Oh, my God!

- Bathroom is next-door!

- Every damn weekend with this!

Janine!
Hi.

Crime, underfunded schools, sewage.
These are real problems that our community is facing.
Looking forward to your vote on November 3.
Thank you.
- It's great.

What?

Don't know, but 60% is, like, a lot.
- Yeah.

I don't understand, Wesson literally tweeted out a dick pic.
He apologized.
Yes.

and then he tweeted out another one.
Look, if Wesson wins, he's literally gonna cut every single program that actually helps people.
We know that.

But people want to vote for someone they can relate to.
They feel safe with Wesson.
They want to have a beer with him.
I'm not sure anyone wants to have a beer with that.
Hey, Alice.
Hey.

I got my IUD taken out for Miami.
Is that a good idea?
Yeah.

Jess, Wesson tweeted out another dick pic, and it's already got 10,000 retweets.
Alice, I got to call you back.
Tulum, give her back her Kindle!
Every fuckin' day.
- Hey.

I'm so sorry.

It's okay.
- I got you chicken cashew nut, extra nut.

I ate an apple and a bag of very, very stale pretzels at the office.
It was so hard to get extra nut.
That woman is so mean.

She thought I hung up, but I heard her call me a dipshit.
- How much did you tip?

- I know.

You're just such a good person.
It's Alice.

- It's okay, get it.

Enough with my bachelorette itinerary.
Like, she's planned it to the half hour.
Yeah, I feel like this weekend has come at the worst possible time.
I'm so stressed out.
You'll see your friends, you'll have fun.
It'll be restorative.
Like that time we took Xanax and slept for 16 hours.
Oh, God, that was good.
You know, I love those girls, but I really just don't want to have a party weekend right now.
I want to have a weekend with you.
- I miss you.

- You've been at the office, like, nonstop.

Wait, wait, one...

I'm gonna want to have sex.
I'm okay with that.
- I'm down.

But I have, like, four things I have to do before.
I just have to print out those itineraries for the city council meeting.
And I have to email the Herald.
I have, like, a 25-minute-ish interview.
- Okay.

I tell you what, I'm gonna let you do all that, and I'm gonna go masturbate in the shower and go to sleep.
- Really?

- You're the best.

- I love you.

- So, I texted you the address.

Shots, shots, shots, shots!

Shots, shots, shots!
Yay!

Oh, my God.
- What's on my head?

Your bachelorette weekend.
I have been waiting for this moment since the first day of freshman year.
- Get in here.

Oh, my God, there's gonna be so many hot Miami babes.
We are gonna be swimmin' in dick, girl!
Hi, Alice.
- Peter.

And get out of here, she's mine now.
Don't get in too much trouble, okay?
- Yeah, I won't.

Drive safe.

Will do.
Hey, Alice, be careful swimming in all that dick.
What are you?

I'm so happy to see you.
This weekend's gonna be so much fun.
Can't wait to see my girls!
When the pepper spray hits your face, and it will, keep your mouth closed tight.
- We are peaceful protestors.

Yet we fight, you know?

- Yeah!

Okay, I got to head to a bachelorette.
But if anybody from the group disappears from the protest, you text my cell phone immediately.
You have a cell phone?
- No.

I'll pick you up after school on Monday, okay, sweetie?
Mommy, do you have to go to Miami?
Yes, I really do.
But I'm gonna miss you so much.
Technically, my time started 20 minutes ago, so, going to note this for the custody hearing.
I love you.
Bye.
Well, well, well.
Damn.
Damn.
How do you do it?
How do you look this flawless getting off a plane?
It's honestly rude.
What, are you flirting with me?
I would not flirt with a happily married woman who broke my heart.
Oh, my God, you broke up with me, don't even start with that.
Excuse me, now you are flirting with me, okay?
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you, too.
Girl, I have had a day.
First was full, I had to ride business.

- Gross.

Oh, my God, did you hear Alice is making us go to a foam party?
I know.
She has a scary amount of time on her hands.
Even though she's a full-time teacher, I'm still like, "Get a job."
Do you have a job?
Activism is a full-time job, but...
Also no.
Look at them, the magic is still there.
- Hello!

- Hi!

- Oh, my God!

God, you smell so good.
I have, like, half a pound of weed in my bra.
- Hey, Alice, how's your mom?

Good.
The Wallace 5th Floor Girls are back together again!
God, when was the last time we were all together?
I think it was two summers ago when we came to visit you in your tree, right?
No, no, no, 'cause Jess couldn't make it, it was...
New Year's Eve, when Blair was in labor.
- Oh, my God.

Yeah.

- Yes!

The party starts now.
Oh, my God.

- Yeah, we're in an airport.

- That sounded like a gunshot.

- Let's go.

- Sorry.

I was never here!

- Nice Miami house, mami.

We are supposed to pick up the keys from the neighbors.
Did you bring a bathing suit?
- Hello?

Hi.
Sorry, somebody left some keys for...
- Oh, my goodness.

- So sorry.

No, no, I'm sorry.
Let me put something on.
- Come on in.

- Is it really?

- Hello.

- Thank you.

Okay.
What brings you to Miami?
Business?

The business of pleasure?
Bachelorette weekend.
Jess is getting married.
- Congratulations!

This marriage, will it be open?
You know, we haven't discussed it.
But, probably closed.

Tightly, tightly closed.
Lea, does she not remind you of our French girl from Turks and Caicos?
She does.
Thank you.

Well, we're gonna try to keep it down.
Well, we'll try not to.
Yes!
- They're serious.

She is delicious.
I want that.
Yes.
Real World, baby!

This house represents everything I hate.
I'm gonna go take a protest dump.
I call the room next to Jess!
I think that room has bunk beds, so you're gonna have to share with Pippa.
Who that?
Pippa, my Australian friend from semester abroad.
She's been CC'd on, like, every single email.
Right.
Well, if my snoring bothers her, she can take the couch.
Or she can just start on the couch and we'll go from there.
We'll figure it out.

- Blair.

Can you be careful with the red wine on the white carpet, please?
My biggest and only donor generously lent us this house for the weekend.
- So, please be careful.

I'm telling you, she's got bigger problems than a wine stain if she wants to sell this place for 3.4 in this market.
- How do you know that?

- I Zillow everybody.

Like, do you know how much my house is worth?
Okay, atención.
Bachelorette kit time.
Let me get your attention.
We got it all.
Bride-to-be bathrobe for our lovely Jess, penis straws, penis sunglasses, penis sprinkles, penis gum, penis hats, penis pasta.
And yes, I did get a little drunk and ate some of that dry.
- Don't judge.

Also, I wrote you a card.

- Thanks, Alice.

Shit.

- Frankie?

Oh, my God!
What?
- Oh, my God.

Is that a sex swing?
Your donor is a freak, Jess.
Please.

I'm sure somebody else left it here accidentally.
And installed a load-bearing beam to support it accidentally.
- Yeah.

I want to audition some dresses for tonight.
I brought 14.

Jess, if you are working,
- I'm gonna smack you in the face right now.

- One second.

- Wait, wait, let me send it.

All right, come on, let's take a picture.
- Say, "Miami forever."

- You want us in the picture or not?

- We're here, too.

Cool.
I'm so bummed I can't tag you in this, on Facebook.
Why did you delete your account?
I had to.

Yeah.
It's Pip!

- What?

Pip!
Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

Hello, hello, hello.
Oh, my God.

You're a goddess.

- Guys...

This is Pippa.
- Hello.

Frankie, Blair, Alice.
Hey, what's up?
My God, you guys are meeting for the first time, this is so exciting.
- I know.

This is so weird, you guys, because it's sort of like you're all Jess's best friends, I'm Jess's best friend.
And so it's sort of like we're all already best friends, you know?
Well, it's a little different for us, sorry to interrupt, but Jess and I were freshman year roommates, so it's kind of like family.
- I know, I know.

Feel free to gel.
Just gonna sit on my suitcase here.
I'm famished.
- Do you want my leftovers?

No, I was gonna wrap that up and take it to go.
I think we're done.

It's okay.

When you got bread and Vegemite, you got yourself a meal.
What?

They should call you cuckoos instead of Kiwis.
Am I right?
- Alice.

That's funny on several levels, because I'm actually Australian and a Kiwi is a New Zealander.
There's nothing wrong with being a Kiwi, we all love Kiwis, but, it's sort of like calling a Chinese person Japanese.
It's just sort of like, little bit racist to not recognize the cultural differences there, you know?
Oh, my gosh.
Eat me out.

I'll take it.
Pippa, what do you do?
Well, singer-songwriter is the dream.
Party clown is the reality.
Check.

A chair.
A chair.
Right.
I'm so excited to see you.

- Tell me everything.

The flight was literally amazoir.
It's toast, toast time.
Raise your glasses, Jess.
Gosh, I can't believe you're getting married.
Feels like just yesterday you were showing me how to hide that cat scratch on my face with that cover-up.
I remember that.
And even though we don't get to see you all the time because you're so busy with Peter and the campaign and changing your Brita filters or whatever it is you white people do,
I love you, and you're my best friend.
To me and Jess.
- Be-cheers.

I love you, Alice.

Three toasts is the limit tonight, though.

If you're gonna do another one, do it now, 'cause I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Do you want to come?

It's a heteronormative thing that girls do.
Okay, guys, no one responded to my emails about which club we were gonna go to, so I printed out the top 10 according to Yelp.
I have my personal favorite, but I don't want to sway anyone, so...
- Is it the one that's circled in big red?

I was kind of hoping that we could make it an early night.
Yeah, right.

- That doesn't feel right.

I mean, I've been so overworked...
No, not gonna happen, baby girl, all right?
'Cause this is the biggest weekend of our lives, all right?
Girls, girls.
Hi.

- You fucking what?

America.

Sort of right on the nose.
Yes, okay, now we're talking.
Now, okay, I'm in.

Okay, guys, I can't do any cocaine.
I'm running for office.
What?

- Stop.

I haven't really done drugs myself since I sort of...
I smoked this bit of shoji root on an excursion in the desert, and I died.
Anyway, I'm very jet-lagged, so I will do cocaine, yes.
- So everyone's in?

You guys, hold on.

Stop being a stupid fucking cunt and do a little fucking cocaine!
Jesus, Frankie.
Sorry, I did a little bit of it.
Jess.
It would mean...
Yeah.
It would mean so much to me, if we could do a little bit of cocaine together.
So disgusting!
- Let me get a little more.

Before, I was very tired, and now I'm sort of very awake.
That's the cocaine.
- I figured.

I love this.

- Yeah, girl!

Okay, now put on these fucking sashes.
- Thank you!

Oh, my God!
Yes, yes, yes!
- Oh, my God!

Man, it smells like barf over here.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

I'm getting us drinks.
You guys, you guys, let's get Jess a stripper!
- Yes!

Right?
You guys, you guys, you guys, male or female, though?
Male.

- Yeah.

Frankie, do you have a tampon?
- I need one.

- Thank you.

What day of your flow are you on?
No, no.

In college, we would ask each other for tampons if some guy was skeezing us out and we wanted to be saved.
You just say "tampon," and they run.
Oh, my God, I love that.
I used to use tampons, but now I use David cups.
- You mean DivaCups.

They were designed by my neighbor, David, to collect blood for an art installation he's doing.
Let's stop talking about periods now.
Cool.
All right, everybody, we have a special request from a Caucasian named
Alice!
That's me.

Bring all your girls up here.

Jess, come on.

Give her the drinks.

We won the talent show freshman year with this little routine.
Might want to stand back.

Okay.
If you didn't go to college with us, you're not in the routine.
Okay, get into places.
Yeah!
You're doing so good!
These are my new friends.
Jess, Jess, Jess!
- Oh, shit.

Are you okay?

Did anybody see me fall?
- Everybody saw.

- Alice!

It was be-gorgeous!
Jess, you were supposed to catch me.
You know, I forgot that one part.

It's a pretty important part!
Would some more cocaine make you feel better?
Yes!
This Montepulciano is majestic and rebellious.
Tell me, what are you tasting?
Pepper.
Pass.

Forest floor.
Licorice.
- There's a nostalgia to it, you know?

You are all correct!
- Yes!

It's Jess.
- Take it.

I'm drunk!

Oh, no.

- Well, it's getting pretty wild over here, too.

I'm getting, like, a light beeswax.
I like that.
Jess, guy says that we can drive his Lambo.
- Babe, I got to go.

Call me when you're home safe.
- I will.

Get off the phone.
Are we ready to get crazy?
- Yeah.

This Lambrusco is served...
Chilled!
Do you guys remember Michelle?
Michelle, she was obsessed with Nickelback.
Beauty, Jess!
- I know what this soiree needs.

Pizza!
Yeah!
- Pizza!

- Yes!

Okay, I love her.
- Right?

She is...

I am telling you, she is one of us.
- She is so free-spirited.

- I just...

- I totally feel it.

- Like, what's her deal?

- She's here for a bachelorette party.

- Build a wall.

I don't want to do anything illegal tonight.
- What?

You just snorted a mound of cocaine.
- Simultaneously.

That was, like, for Jess.
- Don't put that on me.

You're literally cuckoo.
I'm just, like, voicing what some people are thinking,
- you know what I mean?

Okay, no snags.
This is a pizza shop, yeah?
God, it is so warm.
You guys have to get in.
I am coming.
I am gonna warn you now.
Did not have time to self-wax, so it is like a jungle down there.
- Self-wax?

Like, with those weird little, like, paper strips?
Yikes, dude.
Even I'm like, "Yikes, dude."
Look, you guys, I don't understand.

Okay, I got it, I got it.
- Well, that was fast.

Okay, come on.
- Hey...

Stripper's here!
- You guys!

I don't want a stripper!
Did you bring a CD or anything?
Like, Now That's What I Call Music!

- No.

I got some pretty filthy music on my phone.
- I'll hook you up.

- Hey.

Hey, I got to take a piss.
Oh, yeah, there's a bathroom down there.
All right.
It's, like, down there.
I bet he's going to fluff his junk!
Let's give him room, let's make a stage, yes.
You guys, I don't want a stripper.
I think he looks like he's on something.
He's definitely on something.

Oh, my God, he's gonna eat our faces.
- Oh, God, he would!

- I've never even had a striptease.

Well, there was that one time.
Yes!
Maybe somebody else should go.
- Stripper.

And lucky for you, so lucky, you get to do whatever you want.
Fuck her!
- Alice!

- Too much.

- Okay!

First layer, off.
- Oh, shit.

- Okay.

Here he comes.

Happy Boxing Day.
Yes!
It's kind of turning me on, but I really have to pee, so it's, like, so confusing.
Mansploitation, bitch!

Let's get to the beans, let's get to the beans.
Yeah, just do it.
Get it over with.

- So good!

Make her feel special.
- Yes!

He's warm.
All right.

Okay.
I know you want it, you little slut.
Oh, God!

Gross.

So aggressive.
- I'm definitely gay.

- Shit!

- I'm good!

Are you okay?
Him?

Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

What the fuck?

- Oh, my God, he's not breathing!

Does anybody know CPR?
- Oh, my God.

- No, no, no.

We got to do something!
Bugger!

Jess, do something!
- Shit.

Holy shit!
Oh, please, God, please don't let this happen.
He's bleeding out.

I have some Advil.

What's Advil gonna do, Alice?
- It's extra-strength, bitch!

- Four, five, six, seven, eight...

Fuck.
He's dead.
- Oh, shit.

Turn off the fucking music!
- Oh, shit.

I didn't mean to.
I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no.

Paper towels!

Why don't you do something, Blair!
I'm delegating!
- I killed a guy.

Oh, God.
- Not the bathroom towels.

What are you talking about!
Who cares about towels right now?
Well, I don't know!

I killed a guy!
Oh, God!
- I killed a guy today.

- Deep breaths, deep breaths.

- Deep breath.

"What have you been up to?"
"Death."
- Keep it in there.

Time to call the police.

No, no, no, don't call the police.

Let's get rid of the drugs, and then we'll call the police.
Yeah, we'll just, we'll clean up a dead stripper, cool.
Well, technically, he's a prostitute.
- He's a prostitute?

I got him from Craigslist.
He is a stripper, but then also an escort.
You hired a gigolo?
Don't judge sex work, Blair!
- Oh, my God!

You know I'm running for public office!

It's worse for me.

If I get a third, I could go to jail for 25 to life.
I'm not even supposed to be out of the state right now.
I had to pry my ankle monitor off with a shoehorn to get here!
Oh, God.
It's the chair's fault.
Fuckin' shit chair!
Wait a minute.

It was an accident.

So, like, we're not gonna get in trouble for an accident.
We're in Florida, Alice.
A white dude is dead at the hands of a bunch of women.
Yeah, white women.
I'm black, in case any of you have forgotten.
I think the only person who's forgotten that is you.
How dare you.
I rest my case.
I knew this weekend was a terrible idea.
What?

This can still be the best weekend of our fucking lives!
Let's just smile a little bit about it.

Okay, we're gonna be fine.
- We're gonna call the cops, but Jess is right.

We need to make this seem as innocent as possible, so let's get rid of all the drugs.
I'm on it.
Alice, not by doing them!
Okay, someone tell me what to do, and I will do it.
What the...
Shit, shit, shit.
It's pizza.
You guys, what are we gonna do?
The house is made of glass.

We got to move him, you guys.
Do it, do it, do it.
Go, go, go.
Wait, wait, wait, you guys.
You guys, you guys, you guys, wait, wait, wait.

Watch the couch.
- Shit.

Does anyone have cash for a tip?
I have Australian dollars.
They're stronger than American dollars.
Castelucci Pizza.
- What's this?

- Oh, God.

I was natural.
Okay, open it.
Open it up.
Yes.
How can you eat right now?
Eating is the number one way people deal with stress, okay?
Don't give me shit.
You guys want some?
- Yeah, I'd go for a slice.

Okay, I think now it's time for us to call the cops, yeah?
Wait, wait, wait.

- Okay.

We're gonna be interrogated?
We are 100% gonna be interrogated.
Somebody died in a sketchy way.
They're gonna separate us into little cells, you know, with swinging lights.
The coppers are gonna try to crack us, fucking pigs!
Okay, let's definitely call a lawyer, then.
Oh, my God.

He was on the team that defended Bernie Madoff.
- Thank God.

Wait.

- Good idea.

- Shit!

The foam party!
Should I sell our passes?
You're right.

Smart, Jess.
Oh, shit!

- Okay.

- Do not answer that.

- No!

Hello!
- Hey, babe.

- Stop.

- Hang up.

Yeah, everything's great.
Did you do whippets again?

- What?

- Hang up.

- Peter, something really bad happened.

- What?

He was a stripper, like, a prostitute.
- A prostitute?

About what?

Jess, do you still want to get married?
- You can't, you can't...

Jess!
I can't believe you just did that.
We can't talk to anybody until we consult with a lawyer.
She's right.

I'm collecting everyone's phones until we know what the plan is.
- Agreed?

Agreed.
- Well, I have a game on it that relaxes me.

Thank you.
Okay, so we got to get this burner phone from a convenience store.
- Smart.

- Frankie and I can go.

- Or, like, anybody else could go.

- Do we argue?

- It's true, but...

That's funny.

- It's semantics.

I didn't realize I was talking to a wordsmith.
- They used to be lovers, yeah?

I'm a wordsmith 'cause I read the news regularly.
- Is it that obvious?

I have a sort of a sense of these things.
Also, she's been fixated on her nips.
Just because I don't use Tom's of Maine deodorant, which, by the way, does not work...
I don't use Tom's deodorant...
- It's kind of nasty to watch, isn't it?

Yeah, so, I call.

She sounds very strange.
I know something's wrong immediately.
And then, finally, she admits it.
She says something really bad happened with a prostitute.
That does not mean she cheated.
But if she was going to cheat, this is when she would do it.
- Oh, God.

It's pretty classic.
It's not cheating if it's with a prostitute.

- What?

Look, guys, we have to have realistic attitudes about sexual exclusivity.
Whatever.

I asked her if she still wanted to get married.
She screamed "no" and then she hung up!
So, guess what, guys, there's no wedding for you to go to, so return your tuxes.
No!
- No.

It's not a shock, right?
I mean, buddy, I love you, you're one of my best friends, but you're a six and she's a...
Twenty.
- Oh, my God.

I'm feeling...

I'm feeling dizzy, I'm...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

I knew I shouldn't date out of my league, I knew it.
When she first asked me out, I thought it was a prank.
I could feel her pulling away, but I thought it was work.
- I'm gonna be sick.

- Give him some Madeira.

- Yeah.

- I'll get you a soft cheese!

This is so stupid.
Yeah, but this way no one can definitively ID our face.
Old people.

Any brand is fine.
What's that on your face?
A detoxifying mud mask.
Look, we need a burner phone, okay?
- Here's some cash.

- Okay.

You baby boomers are so demanding.
I know.
- Jesus.

I can't believe he's dead.
- And it's, like, all my fault.

It really is a tragedy, you know?
He could have been a scientist that was gonna cure cancer or something.
- It's nice of you to say.

Guys, is he looking, like, straight at me?
- Oh, my God, he's...

He's looking at me, right?
Hi, baby boy.
Mummy Hubbard's here.
She's gonna send you home.
Okay.
Sleep now.
Oh, no.

- Okay, why don't we...

- I don't like it.

- I got it.

- I'm done.

He looks good, right?
Totally.
- Oh, my God, Jess.

Look at this ring.
It's even bigger in real life than it is on Skype.
Yeah, he did a good job.
You guys Skype?
- Yes.

Yes.
It's really nice to just sort of, you know, see the person when you're talking to them.
- I didn't know that.

You don't know Skype?
Skype is a free video calling app.
- You should...

Jess, you said you couldn't remember your password.
Well, it is really hard to sign in.
- Oh, shit!

- Whose dog is that?

- Go!

- The owner is coming towards the house.

No, no, no.

I can speak to animals, we have a deep understanding,
- so I got this.

- Just go!

- Okay.

Okay, Charlie.

Come on, come on.
Shit!
- Charlie!

This is impossible, anybody can see into the house from the beach.
- This is crazy.

If someone reports it before we do, we're dead.
Well, we just...

- Yeah, okay.

- Okay.

- You all right?

Oh, my God, Pip, I can see all of his teeth marks.
That looks really bad.
No, no, no.

That's not...

Yeah, she's fine.

Okay?

- Let's do it.

- Let's go!

Hold the door.

- Got it.

- Yeah, we got it.

- Put him down.

Can somebody turn the lights on?
- I'll get it.

- That's better.

Shit!

Why?

Pippa, what did you do?
This is a poltergeist situation.
I'm not doing anything.
- All right.

- Oh, God.

There is a taxi right here.
No!

No, thank you.
- Cover the body.

- Balls!

Find a quilt.

- What the...

- No.

No, no, I just peed.
- I have no control over this.

Close, you fuck.
- Here you go, sir.

- Thank you very much for the ride.

- Safe home!

We're starting a garage band.

We're hiding a body.

Stop saying "body" so many times.
- Alice, what the hell are you doing, man?

- Come on.

Lift him up with your legs.

I swear to God, he's getting heavier every time.
Just hold one second.
- There's two stairs up here.

- I got it.

Break, break, break.
- No, no, no.

- Okay.

- Really good.

Why are we moving the dead stripper?
The whole house is made out of glass.
This is impossible.

Where could we put him that he's not gonna be seen?
So, what do you think, Uncle Jack?
They could charge you with involuntary manslaughter, but it's not that easy to prove.
- Thank God.

- That's okay.

- and you'll be fine.

Okay, so actually, we have already moved him to a sex swing, Your Honor.
What?
I said, "Actually, we have already moved him to a sex swing, Your Honor."
I heard you.
You knowingly tampered with the scene, which means you're guilty of accessory after the fact, and they'll have a strong case for involuntary manslaughter.
Wait, what does that mean?
Up to 15 years in prison.
- What?

- Well, what can we do?

- It's a burner phone.

Like I told Rob Lowe, if there's no body, there's no case.
We can't just chop him up.
You know what?

No, we all moved the body.
It's a crime.
Well, yeah, but if we just, like, explain the situation...
What are you talking about, "Explain"?
Last year, a guy in Tampa, he threatened to kill his wife, so she fired a warning shot, and she went to jail for 20 years.
This country should be burned to the ground!
Shit.
I was so close.

My career.
It's all over, just like that.
I'm gonna do real time.
Maybe life.
You guys are gonna get off with a few years.
I can't do any years.

- What?

What?
Malcolm and I separated six months ago.
You didn't tell me.
Yeah, you've been a little preoccupied, Jess.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't need your judgment.
Blair, I would never judge you for something like that.
Oh, my God, my students.
They idolize me.
They think I'm, like, the best fucking adult in the whole fucking world.
They'll turn to crime.
I can't go to jail.
I couldn't even make it through the first episode of Orange Is the New Black.
None of us can.
It's too soapy, right?
No, I meant none of us can go to jail.
Wait, you guys.
Even if we don't get charged with this tampering with evidence thing, we don't know who this man is.
His family could come seek revenge.
He could be part of a cartel that's gonna cut off our toes and stick them up our bums.
She's right.
We'll have to look over our shoulders for the rest of our lives.
He did say that it would be hard to convict with no body.
I mean, it was an accident.
And he's not part of an escort company, you know?
So I don't think anybody knows he's here.
We got to get rid of him.
- We gotta, right?

- We do.

- I mean, we don't want to.

We didn't want to kill him.
- We have no other option.

- Of course we have to.

Must.
Hey, it's Blair.

Okay.

That means something really bad happened.
Dude, this is, like, the third girlfriend that's cheated on you.
What is that?

Does your dick bend weird when it gets hard?
No.
- All right.

Let's get you on Tinder right now, so you can start on a rebound.
- No, I don't want to be on Tinder, okay?

You've gotten over other girls, you can get over her.
Yeah, this isn't some girl, this is Jess.

And I don't want to get over her.
Then, this time, do something about it, Peter.
You're right.
You're right, I got to go to Miami, and I got to win her back.
- Yes, dude.

The first flight out of Charleston gets in at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.
- No.

Not quick enough.

What?
He has to sad astronaut.
- Okay, what is that?

- Sad astronaut?

Okay.
Lisa Marie Nowak was an astronaut.
And she was in love with another astronaut named Will.
Now, Will cheated on Lisa with some hottie Air Force captain.
Lisa found out and was pissed.
So, Lisa decided to deal with it.
Once and for all.

Point is, she used that crazy astrophysicist brain to find the quickest way to Florida.
- You want to get Jess back, right?

Then you got to sad astronaut, bro.
Let's get some diapers.
Not this brand!

- Jesus Christ.

I think it's the body on top.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

Okay, wait, does anyone know how to actually drive this thing, or...
I could do it.
I took one to school every day growing up, so, I feel pretty confident.
- Great.

- Hello!

- Hello!

- The neighbors!

Okay, oh, my God, oh, my God, what do we do?
- No, no...

- So happy to see you.

- Nope.

We hoped you were skinny-dipping.
- No.

- Nope.

- My, my.

You know, I think they just wanted to make love in international waters.
- Yeah.

No.

So, let's just...
This certainly gets me in the mood.
Hey, Blair.
- You need a tampon?

We just opened a bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape, and we're listening to some remastered Fleetwood Mac.
- That's so nice.

- I bet.

- That's so sweet.

Unless it's asked for.
Okay.
I am fully exhausted.
- So tired, you know?

We're fluent in body language.
I bet you are.
- Goodnight.

All right.
- God.

- Pippa.

- What is going on there?

- Pippa!

Oh, my God.
Yeah.

- Sorry.

- Let's dump him, yeah?

Let's do the dump.
Okay, Spanish language CDs.
If Jess hooked up with a Spanish speaker, you're gonna want to reason with him.
And I got this generic Russian Adderall.

It will help you focus.
It's super strong, but it is expired, so...
- Thank you so much.

- I love you.

- Get her back.

You are peeing.
I'm so scared.
I feel like we should say something.
- Yeah.

We're really sorry.
- You deserved better.

There's nothing we could do to bring you back, but...
We promise to spend the rest of our lives trying to be better people.
We owe that to you.
God, we're so sorry.
So sorry.
So sorry, man.
We suck.
Okay, you can dump him now!
Aye aye, Captain.
This never happened.

- Nope.

Right?
- No, we're not gonna talk about it.

Okay, bye.
That could have been more delicate.
She's going really fast.
I did it!
- Oh, my God, what the fuck is she doing?

Holy shit!
- Oh, my God!

I'm good.

Are you sure, 'cause you landed right on your neck.
Yeah, I just did a sort of straight shot, landed on the neck, snap, and we're back up.
- It was good.

I thought you knew how to drive those things.
Yeah, no, I definitely do, but I think the gas and the brake are different in Australia, so I got confused.
- How are you alive right now?

But I'll take it.
Well, body dumped, girl's alive.
- What's next?

- Great idea.

- Let's do that.

Guys?
She should probably get a CAT scan.
Okay.
She's fine.
- Is there any more pizza left?

No!
Jesus, dude, we can order more.
No, not that.

- What?

They have footage of us dumping the body.
We should just turn ourselves in, right?
- We're fucked.

We got rid of the body.

- Right?

- Yep.

- Yes.

No.
Absolutely not.
Thank you.
Your house is so...
- Funky.

You should see our panic room.
May I?
It's happening.

You know what would be really, really sexy?
Please tell me.
If we got this on tape.
You naughty girl.
Actually, I noticed that you guys have these cameras outside and it's always been a fantasy of mine to get caught on a security camera, so...
Mesdemoiselles?
Okay.

Thank you.
Okay.
- Okay.

Yeah, we're watching for Blair.

- Man, Blair looks great.

You ready?
- Yeah, think so.

Relax.
I've got you.
- Holy shit!

- Interesting.

Yes!

Give me those.

Hey, it's Jess.

Jess, it's Peter.
How are you?
Just calling again.

What a story this'll be.
For the grandkids.

Do me a favor, call me back.

I love you so much.

Hey, it's Jess.

Jess!
Yes!
I would love a copy of the tape, you know, for, like, jerking off later, whatever.
Me, too.

The tape.

You know, the DVD or the...
You know, from the cameras.
Those don't work.
- Excuse me, what?

But we know that's not what this was about.
Right?

- Creating a mise en scène.

Why would someone have security cameras that don't work?
They didn't charge us for the first three months.
After that, we didn't want to pay for the service.
You know, they keep out the riffraff.
You'll just have to jerk off as the Italians do.
To your memories.
Wait, so, Blair, so there's no footage?
No.
Oh, my gosh.

That's great.
- Yeah.

She was inside me.
And then she was outside me.
And then she was me.
- So, we're good.

Whatever.

I mean, I don't have HPV.
Alice, they say if you had sex after the year 1991, you have HPV.
Then, I mean, I definitely have HPV then.
I have, like, clumps and clumps of it.
Cool.

Okay.
- Okay.

- We did good.

- Yes.

This child is not my son.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Shit.

I don't have time for this.
Good evening, Officer.
How can I be of service to you?
- Sir, you been drinking?

I did do a wine tasting earlier this evening, Italian reds mostly, but you don't really drink it, you mostly spit.
You take sips and you spit into a bucket.
What the...

- No.

- Officer...

Hands.

Officer, I can explain.
She's a 20!
Okay, before we go, we got to do human friendtipede, yeah?
- What?

- No way.

- It's tradition.

What is a human friendtipede?
It's a photo we always take that's like the movie Human Centipede.
Where they're sewn together, mouth to anus, but it's with friends,
- so it's special.

- I don't know about that.

Guys, if I don't post a ton of pictures from this weekend, it's gonna look suspicious.
Like we killed someone.
Okay.

- Yes!

Okay.

Why do you want the middle?
Okay.

Say "friendtipede."
Friendtipede!
Cute.
Yes!
- Let's see it.

- Alice, stop.

- Oh, my God.

- Shit!

- Are you kidding me?

Oh, my God, oh, my God!
God, I thought you weighed him down.
I did.

Men need to wear belts.
Yeah.

Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q, P, O,
N, M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A.
Okay.
Did you see that?
- You only had to walk a straight line.

- Are you a dancer or...

I've never done anything like that before in my life.
I still got to give you a speeding ticket.
Please.

Slow down.
- Thank you, Officer.

I know.

We can't get rid of his body in broad daylight, you guys.
We have to think of something.

Ideas?
- Kiwi!

- We need everyone's brain on this, so...

So, here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go to the beach and do a bit of mindful meditation.
And when I come back,
I'm gonna have a be-genius idea.
Yeah?

We got it.
We're never gonna get rid of his body.
He's gonna follow us around for the rest of our lives.
- Oh, God.

- Police!

Oh, my God.

Do you think the neighbors called them?

- Oh, my God.

Women, this is my world.

Turn out the lights and hide.
Good evening, Officer.
Step aside, miss.
What's this all about?
Put your hands where I can see them.
Officer, I am cooperating.

Get your hands against the wall.
- I am not...

I am taking a passive stance.
My body is limp for you!
Spread them.
What are you doing?

No!

- Fuck!

- Frankie!

Now we have a dead guy and an unconscious cop?
- What is wrong with you?

He's obviously a rape cop.

When they have dirt on you, they sexually assault you, knowing you won't report it.
- Daniel Holtzclaw, Oklahoma City?

He sexually assaulted eight women.
Like Matt Dillon in Crash.
- Oh, my God, that was horrendous.

Information is power, guys.

Okay, chill out.

Okay. "You are not your father's daughters but mothers unto your own."
Wait, is that John Mayer?
It's Malcolm X.
- Pretty sure it's John Mayer.

Okay, you guys, you guys, we have to move this guy before the neighbors return to eat Blair out again.
I'd be fine with that.
- All right.

All right, one, two, three.
Frankie, how many strippers did you order?
Just the one.
Then who's this guy?
- Let me see his dick real quick.

- Wait, what?

- But I can ID him by his member.

I'm not sure.
He had a boner in his ad.
This one's soft.
I can get it hard.

- What?

Okay, yes.

This is Scotty with the Body.
Then who did we kill?
- Hello?

We have detected unusual activity on your account.
If you have attempted a purchase at
Quickie Stop in Port St. Lucie, please press one.
Thank you for pressing two.
Your card has been suspended due to unusual activity.
No.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- How's that?

If you're looking for our cell phones, I locked them in this drawer and I'm not gonna open it, okay?
Please let me at least text Peter.

Not until everything is sorted out.
We made a plan.
Alice.
- What's up, dude?

I'm just making sure nothing's broken.
I think he's fine.
Yeah, he's really fine.
- Jesus.

You need to masturbate more.

I know.

She's very smart.
- Why don't you put her in a cage?

But I'm loud.

- I remember.

And it kind of sounds like her.
So she thinks I'm talking to her.
I'm like, "No, I'm just fucking touching myself."
Like, "Back off."
Cool, so back to our life-changing emergency?
Okay, the stripper's here, he's alive.
- That's good.

There is still a dead guy in the closet, so...
- Who is that guy?

Oh, my God.

That'll work.
- Thank God!

All right, we're gonna drive to the alligator bog, dump the body.
We're gonna return the Smart car, wake up the G-string guy, tell him he hit his head really hard.
- Blair's gonna give him a ton of cash.

- And then we're home free.

Alligator bog.
You will arrive at your destination in 45 minutes.
Yeah.
Can I do your...

Don't litter.
All right.
Hey, thanks a lot, man.
- For you.

So, I got meth.
You looking?

No, thank you so much.

Hey, listen, do you want to suck my dick for 15 bucks?
- No.

Good luck, man.
Thanks, man.
You will arrive in 25 minutes.
This is so uncomfortable.
I mean, does this thing go any faster?
- Wait!

So it does go faster?
- Hi, sir.

- Okay.

Let me suck your dick real fast.
What?
- Please?

Okay, listen...
Do you have any meth?
- I could sell you meth, yeah.

- 80 bucks.

There you go.
- Hey, man.

I want to buy some meth.
Only thing is, though, you got to do a little bump, though, so I know that you're not a cop.
No, man.

You want the meth or not?
Okay.
Here we go.
- And one for Papa Bear.

40 bucks.

- Yes.

So, still a no-go on the BJ, or...
No, I'm good.

That's fine.
Actually, there's somebody I want to introduce you to.
- Right on!

- Good to meet you, too.

- Yeah, go.

You got to do it, man.

Guys, I fell asleep.
I fell asleep.
I had this nightmare where we had all killed a guy.
- That is a reality.

What?

Oh, my God!

It's no joke!
No joke!
Damn it!
Did you happen to come up with a be-genius idea out there?
Yeah, I did, actually.
In my dream, I remembered that there was this guy in Australia who cooked his girlfriend and ate her.
- Kiwi.

- But...

God, I'm so tired.
We should turn ourselves in.

No, we are innocent, because this was an accident, you guys.
Stop saying that.
Maybe if you hadn't been lethally horny, we wouldn't be in this mess.
I was coked up because you bought us drugs.
I didn't force you to do the drugs, Alice.
And you know what, nobody's talking about how it was
Blair's idea to get a stripper in the first place.
Yeah, but you're never to blame, right?
"Look at me, I'm Frankie.

- "I'm saving the world."

You act like everybody's so stupid for not being a merciless asshole like you.
- I'm the asshole?

- Stay out of this.

Maybe you're the asshole, Alice.
Oh, shit.
Excuse me, bitch?
I'm a fucking sweetheart.
Well, then why do you insist on calling me Kiwi even though I told you it was culturally insensitive?
And why did you feel the need to reach over and try to undo my seat belt in the taxicab on the way here?
- Jesus Christ.

That's an American bit.
We do it as a joke.

Come on, say it.
- Alice!

It's bad enough without you two going at it.
And I thought your bridal shower was a nightmare.
What are you talking about?

No, she didn't.
You had a bridal shower?
Well, not really.

It was, like, work friends.

But Blair went?
It wasn't even open bar.
What?

How could you not invite me?
Alice, please.

Please.

- It wasn't a big deal, man.

He is so annoying.
And I know why he doesn't like me.
'Cause he's, like, so freaking jealous.
Peter is not jealous of you.
Well, then, why would you not invite your best friend to your bridal shower?
- Oh, my God, you really want to know why?

Because I knew that if I invited you, you wouldn't let me talk to anybody else.

Okay?

Are you kidding me?
I do not monopolize your time, Jess!
I just try to make the most of it, 'cause you don't even make an effort to see me anymore.
- That's not true!

It is.
I'm sorry, but you are always at work, or you're making plans with Peter.
Or you're Skyping with other people.

- No, you can't.

We're not in college anymore, and things do change.
The only thing that's changed is you.
You've become obsessed with your perfect new life and your campaign and you ditched me.
I am sorry that I don't want to talk about the time that we got drunk at O'Flaherty's 10 years ago!
Well, you know what?
I guess I never should have planned such a nice weekend for you.
You know, you...

- Did you just say I was ungrateful?

You're an ungrateful person.
You didn't plan this weekend for me.
You planned this weekend for yourself, so that you could post a bunch of photos and not make your life seem so sad!
I'm sorry, Jess.
I'll leave you...
I'll leave you alone from now on.
Alice.
Alice.
Jess, that was really harsh.
Oh, my God, I can't.

I can't with any of this anymore.
Jess, come on, dude.
No.

We are turning ourselves in and that's the end.
Now, I'm going upstairs to wipe this shit off my face, so I can at least look cute for my mug shot.
And self-waxing is not weird.
I don't appreciate your body-hair-removal shaming.
Shame on you!

You've been fine.
Did you hear that?

- What is that?

Where's it coming from?
- Not these pillows.

Fuck, it's his phone.
- Someone is looking for this guy.

- Turn it off.

- What's going on?

Someone is trying to track the stripper's phone and it looks like they're...
Here.
- Hello?

Have you seen this man?
Shit.
We tracked his phone to this house.
We know he's in there.
It's over.
The jig is up.
Hey.
He's dead.
You ladies are lucky.
This man is very dangerous.
This guy robbed a jewelry store and killed a security guard.
- Lot of people looking for him.

Yeah.

Probably came here looking for cover.
Sir, I'm sorry.
Foreigner here.

So, are we sort of, like, no longer in trouble?
Sounds like self-defense to me, right?
Yeah, no, DA's not gonna want to press any charges on something like this.

- Oh, my God.

- Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

We're heroes!

- Thank you, universe.

We killed a guy!

We were right to kill him!
Fuck, yeah!
Jess.
Hey, Jess.

I still might be, for unrelated things, but you're not, you're safe.
Jess?
You should've seen us at the beginning.

We didn't like each other.
Now I can't get her away from me.

Did he happen to mention the diamonds?
No, I think I would have remembered that.

Ladies, it's really important that you try to remember any details.
He was cis male.
Looked like he could, like, wash his car as a hobby activity.
- Okay.

Sort of like two large snakes pointing down to a penis.
This is a big house.
Any place he might've been able to stash something?
Well, we did clean the entire house and never came across his coat or phone, so it's definitely a possibility.
Tampon!
- What?

- What?

I thought you use David cups.
- Yeah.

Fuck off.

You took them from us.
- What?

- and you have the key.

I didn't lock away our tampons.

Are we on the same page, Blair?
- Yes.

Lady, you want to get your friend a tampon or whatever?
Okay.

Just be right back with that.
Well, I'm not on my period.
It's good to know.

Key.
Shit.

Quiet, be quiet, be quiet.

- What the fuck is that?

Nothing.

- What the fuck was that?

- There's more people here?

- Yeah.

- I just need to get to my phone.

- I will not be your drug mule!

- You better get back.

Breaking news and some updated information for everybody.
These assailants are armed and they're dangerous.
- No, it's nothing, that's...

- Hey, blondie!

- The tampon.

That's what I was...

- I just want to get my real estate license!

Freeze!
Shut the fuck up!

What the hell's going on here?

Everyone in America really does have a gun!
Let's go!

- Oh, my God.

- We want those fucking diamonds now.

I know you're mad at the 1%.
- I am, too.

- Tie them up now.

Jess, when I was growing up, I didn't really have many friends.
And when I left for college, my mom was worried about me.
And so was I.
But then we met, and the first night we went out, you didn't introduce me to people as your roommate, you introduced me as your friend.
And I knew everything was gonna be okay.
When I went home that summer and I showed my mom the photos of us hanging out, she was so happy.
She doesn't always recognize me anymore, but when I show her those old photos, she says to me, "That's my daughter with all her friends."
That's how she remembers me.
Thanks to you.
I can't wait to show her all the photos from this weekend.
You were there for me, and I will always be here for you.
Love, Alice.
P.S. There are some wet wipes in here, because I ordered an ice cream cake and I know you have issues with dairy.
Smiliest face.
- Come here.

I'm not even with them!
God damn it.
Shit.
Jay double-crossed us, and he took off with our score.
So, tell me,
- where'd he put it?

Sir, I could wire you $50,000 right now if you just let us go, okay?
50,000 what?
There's over $2 million worth of diamonds in this house, and I am going to find them.
You shoot anyone who moves.
- Oh, my God.

Fuck!
Damn it!

Don't make a fucking sound or I will kill you.
What?
Handcuff yourself to the sink.
- Fuck you.

Okay.

What the fuck?
No...
You don't know anything?

Hurry up, man!
Do I look stupid to you?
You expect me to believe that you killed Jay by accident?
That's a bad accident.
It's a big fucking accident.
I am about to lose my fucking shit.
Jay's dead, and you expect me to believe that you guys don't know anything?
New plan.

- And I'm gonna start with you.

- Oh, God.

I love you, too.
Jess!

Yes!
- Not her beautiful face!

- You perv!

No, hey, hey, hey!
You guys!

Shimmy.

Okay.

- Right there.

- One.

- Three!

Oh, God.

- Oh, God.

Yes.
Point me in his direction.
I don't have a shot!

- No, no.

No, please.
I shot a guy!
- Yes!

You fucking...
Yes!
Oh, my God, you guys!
That was awesome.
- Alice, I'm so sorry.

No.

I think it was just the stress of killing somebody and then trying to dispose of his body.
- Wait, what?

- That's a hard thing.

I have changed.
I thought that I was making people's lives better, but I forgot about the people that make my life better, and that's you guys.
- And I love you, and I'm sorry.

- We love you, too.

- We love you, Jess!

And you know what?

And you were right, I need to stop living in the past
- and get a hobby, you know?

Next time we see each other, we can make new memories instead of just talking about the old ones.
These zip ties are really starting to hurt.
And I'm sorry about Peter, okay?
He does not suck.

- Well, I will.

I mean, I had a sex dream about him, and I didn't even tell you.
No, you actually did tell me.
- You told everybody.

It started with him brushing my hair...
You know what?

- Awesome.

- Here, give me the gun.

Drop the gun!
- Drop it.

The keys were taped to the handcuffs, you fucking idiot.
You're all dead.

- No.

Really?

What?

What?
- Oh, my God!

Oh, my God.

- Peter!

I can't see.
Peter?

Peter.
- Jess.

Do you not like my dick?
What?
Does it bend weird when it gets hard, or, like...
- I don't know, is it...

So, you still want to get married?
Yes.

I want that.
Peter...
Let's just get married.

Well, what about the campaign?

I don't want to wait.

That's all that matters.
- What about your parents?

I mean, my mom did say to lock that down as soon as possible.
- She did?

- I love you.

Yes!
I have the perfect place.
Do you, Jessica, take Peter to be your husband?
I do.
And do you, Peter, take Jessica to be your wife?
I definitely do.
Now, by the power vested in me by GetOrdainedNow.net,
I pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the groom.
So glad I didn't sell our passes to the foam party.
- Yeah!

So, you guys are just not in trouble?
No, we're, like, completely free.
We've committed what in Florida is known as a "good murder."
That's a direct quote from the Miami PD.
So, not only do we not have to go to jail, but we got a sick coupon to Romano's Macaroni Grill.
- Do you want to dance, Pippa?

But call me Kiwi, okay?
All my best friends do.
- Hey.

Can I get you a drink?
No.
'Cause I'm on a date with someone else, so...
- Hey.

You're a hot guy.

Here you go.
Oh, my God.
Has anyone ever told you how beautiful your feet are?
No one's ever said that to me before.
You should've been told that a million times.
Do you want to...
- Fuck?

Hey.
Keep it moving.

Love wins.
What'd you just say?
I don't know.

And I don't know how you're gonna get to New York.

I already have my bags packed, actually, so...
Well, just 'cause I'm between places...
Shut up.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.

Babe.

- Hello?

That story about you and your friends taking out those criminals is everywhere!
Okay?

- What?

Are you serious?

Yeah, we're getting a ton of media requests.
Okay, Good Morning America, Ellen.
Okay, you have to get back here right now.

Do you prefer window or aisle?
I'm more of a middle seat guy myself, but...
You know what?

But I'll be there first thing Monday morning.
You're getting married?

- Take a picture of us?

Cool!
- I love you guys.

Three.
Can I see?
- No.

- Another one?

Okay, okay, okay.
- I love it.

- Alice, you can tag me.

Congratulations to State Senator Jess Thayer!
Thank you.
My number one boss bitch!
And now to celebrate her win, we have a special request.
Me?
Thank you so much.
I actually have a surprise for all of you.
I've written a song that I hope can sort of encapsulate
the bond of friendship that we all have.
And so, I want to play it for you now.
Sometimes
You kill a man
When he's taking off his clothes for you
You kill a man
You kill him with your friends
And he dies
Jesus, it's good.
Other times
When you kill a man
You need to toss his body in the ocean
And you don't care
'Cause your friends are there by your side
They make it fun
I love you, girls
I love you, Pippa!
We killed a man
We made a plan
You are my friends
And I'll never forget
This bachelorette
This bachelorette
That's the end.
Do you guys want to come up?
No, no, no.

'Cause I got to do stuff.
So, I will see you at Nussbaum's at 10:00.
No, no. 12:30.
- Okay.

Okay, you guys, go.

We want to make sure that you get in okay.
- You're obsessed with me.

I love you.
Bullshit.
Yes!
