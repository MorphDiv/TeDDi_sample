Previously on "The Magicians"... [screams]
Zillion bucks says The Beast comes back any minute, so what's the plan?
Okay, so here's the thing.
I can't really touch the knife.
We need the power of a god.
I have gifted you my Bestowal.

The more it burns, the less time we have.
There's a spell that seems strong enough.
These are my students.
They are in need of the Rhinemann Ultra.
No one but you can be within 20 feet of the blast.
Alice is going to take just a few minutes to fully power up.
This is a cacodemon.
It'll grow much bigger.
Unleash these, and believe me, they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.
[no audible dialogue]
- Do you know what a Niffin is?

It's when too much runs through you.
Only the magic is left.
Please... fix... my hands.
Go... fuck... yourself?
I think I can help.
- Wow.

You could die if you don't get clear of The Beast.
You think I don't know how dangerous he is?
No.

Yeah, do what you want with him, but not until I get Reynard.
We can't merely summon him.
A god can resist.
I don't give a shit about getting him.
- You should.

I didn't get raped by him.
I have no skin in this.
Reynard is targeting hedges.
[all coughing]
Did you put some kind of curse on the castle?
Did I?
The spell that won World War II is called the Rhinemann Ultra?
Sounds like a not-so-great beer.
Fine, it's a beer, but it's a beer that we can use
- to kill The Beast.

Yeah, super cool how they keep me from killing myself.
And then Dean Fogg gives you all matching tramp stamps?
I thought tramp stamps were supposed to be on our lower back?
God, I feel like I missed out on some crazy party you'll be talking about for the rest of your lives.
Say what you want, but we brought back weapons and a plan.
What do you have to show for yourself?
Ta... fucking... da.
Your royal accoutrement.
This is ceremony, people, and I expect you to slather yourselves in it.
Thank you, Eliot.
I missed you all.
And I was bored.
Come.

Wait, is this really the most important thing we could be doing right now?
I mean, The Beast is still out there waiting for us...
The Beast can wait for five minutes.
You are all Kings and Queens of Fillory.
Well, almost all of you.
Just revel in your majesty for one fucking second.
Be regal, miscreants.
Mm.
You're such a stupid, stupid, man.
I'm gonna kill you in your sleep.
[indistinct whispering]
El...

Totally fine, why?
It's just... you went away there for a minute.
Nonsense.

Have a seat.
I'm kind of on a clock here, so we should talk strategy.
Yeah, we already talked strategy, so we just need to catch you up.
You've been planning without me?
Yeah... when we were on Earth.
What did you think we were doing?
[laughing]
Eliot, we're not trying to exclude you.
You just weren't there.
No.

Don't think I don't see how this works.
You disappear.

Matching tattoos, and now you're three against one.
I know exactly what you're planning.
- Don't touch me.

You kind of sound insane.
Do I?
Because I promise you...

Oo-surpers.
Usurpers. [sighs]
Whichever way you're supposed to pronounce it.
What just happened?
He got like this on shrooms once.
I'll go talk to him.
[sighs]
I just remembered something that Julia said, and it's starting to make a lot of sense.
- You talked to that bitch?

It was a warning.

Uh...

I mean, he'd want to booby-trap his kingdom, right?
So apparently, he left curses behind.
Here, actually.
So you think Eliot might be cursed?
I mean, she was vague, but I mean...
Did either of you notice that Eliot started acting strangely once he took a drink from the goblet?
I mean, it could be poison or a potion.
All right, well, we probably shouldn't drink from ours just to be safe.
Or maybe it was just some primo
Fillorian shit that went up his nose, and he's on the bad end of a trip because he's him.
Did something happen to you?
Nope.

I'm fine...

Wait.

I don't know what you're talking about.
I mean like Eliot.
You're acting all tweaky and shit.
[both]:

Clearly.
Look, I think we can all agree that we have a problem here.
Eliot.
He's High King.

- We have no choice but...

Exactly.
The thrones.
They're both cursed.
This is hard for you.

It's hard for us too.
But it must be done.
[both]:

But don't tell Quentin...
I'm going to have to kill him too.
Right after Margo.
Margo?
Margo.
Margo.

I know.

No, no.

Listen, whatever you do, do not sit on your throne, okay?
Fine.

You gonna help me pick these?
What's this?

Exactly.

For the... what?
For the poison.
I have to drink it first, or I won't get Eliot to take it.
Jesus.

Also, it's not the thrones that are cursed.
I sat on mine, and I'm totally fine.
You sat on your...
Fuck...
Great.

- Okay.

This'll be over soon.
I'll deal with Eliot and Alice and Q.
You're welcome.

Benedict, right?
I need your help.
What do you do here again?
Royal mapmaker, sire.
Is your problem cartographical in nature?
Not really.
What I need, Benedict, is a dagger.
A stiletto, really.
Something I can sneak up and stab someone with.
But regal.
I make maps, Your Majesty.
Well,... surely, someone has snuck into your office and dramatically stabbed a knife into a map to make a point, no?
The other Kings and Queens who died... we'd always just thought it was just infighting.
Greed and power.
Guess what?

The Beast was responsible for, so how do we reverse this?
[sighs] Curses are tricky.
You don't say.
They usually end once they've run their course.
And not before.
That doesn't help us.
This one seems to want to run its course until they're all dead.
Shit.

Do not let them kill each other, okay?
Mm-hmm.

I'm sorry.

Well, if I'd told you before, would you have agreed to it?
Fine.

It's a simple spell, but that doesn't mean it's not powerful.
