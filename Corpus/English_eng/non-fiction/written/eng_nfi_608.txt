WOMAN:

[♪♪♪]
CROWD:

Happy new year!
COMMERCIAL ANNOUNCER:

Assurance global insurance.
WOMAN:

Tail slate.
Insurance seven, take three.

That was fantastic, you guys.
Mia, can you dust the snow off the leads' clothing?
On it.
I want to re-set one more time so we can get a snap-zoom of the guy's reaction.
On it.
Whoa, whoa-- we're doing another shot?
It'll look amazing.
I see where you're going for, but I don't think we need it.
Come on, Dave, throw us a bone here.
Gives something fun to do besides pointing the camera straight ahead.
Bruce, we don't need it.
We're on-time, we're under-budget, and we have all the shots that the creative director-- that is me-- needs.
Okay, Dave, I feel like your concept is great, but I feel like the ad agency put us together this week for a reason.
I'm just here to bring a little more... oomph.
Needs a bit of oomph.
Oomph!
It has oomph.
A smidge more oomph never hurt anyone.
Okay.

But, for the record, i don't think it's necessary.
BRUCE:

You won't regret it.
[SIGHS]
Okay, fine, you were right.
This once, but don't let it go to your head.
Pew!
Okay, that's a wrap, everybody!

There is a fro-yo truck out front, as a thank-you for a great week.
Yeah!
Uh, di-di-di-di- di-di-di-di-di!
I like coffee with the fro-yo.
-Copy that.

[TEXT CHIMES]
Whoa!
Looks like the agency teamed us up together again.
A bakery spot in the new year.
At least we have the new year's off.
Any big plans?
Well, actually,
I'm going to a huge new year's Eve party with my boyfriend, Alex, and then it's my 30th birthday the next weekend.
Really?

Why?

No, i-i meant that, isn't everybody exhausted and partied out after the holidays?
Must be hard to get people to come.
It can be...
Which is why I throw the best parties.
It sets the tone for my entire year.
They have to be spectacular, otherwise no one will come.
Define "spectacular."
Hmm.
[TABLET CLICKING]
Uh, here.
21.

25.

And 28...
We rented out an entire bb for the weekend.
Hard to beat.
What are you gonna do for your big 3-0?
I'm sure it'll be great.
Mm, yeah, well, you know what?
I don't even want to think about my birthday yet.
New year's is a big enough deal.
Why?
You ask a lot of questions for a guy I barely even know.
Okay, never mind.
It's just...

Me too.
I get together with my buddies out in farmingham every year, and we have a midnight football game.
Basically, whoever doesn't sprain their ankle wins.
[LAUGHS] Well, I will be wearing four-inch heels, so I guess same goes for me.
[CHUCKLES]
Well, happy new year.
Same to you.
[SIGHS]
Fingers crossed.
MIA:

No, Mia, this is perfect, and this falls under "best friend cone of silence."
You can never let Alex know that, if it wasn't for your constant guidance,
I would be wearing hoodies and sweatpants all the time.
Well, we all have our thing.
You direct people, i dress them.
So tonight's the night?
Don't jinx it!
I'm not.

We all are.
Well, I'm not technically 30 until next week.
It's new year's Eve.
It's showy and dramatic, just like Alex.
Anyway...

[EXHALES DEEPLY]
[EXHALES CONTENTEDLY]
[GASPS] No way!
I know, right?
How awesome is this?
Amazing!
I was going for serious, yet compassionate...
All under an aura of trustworthiness.
Mm.

Here, take a pic for my instachat.
Ahem.
All right...
Got it!
-You get it?

Oh...

Ooh...
Wait...

Yes?
You've got just, like, a little smudge of lipstick on your tooth.
There you go.
You look gorgeous, by the way.

[TAKING DEEP BREATHS]
In we go.
Alex!

Happy new year!

I'm glad...

I was worried you'd go to the burtons' party.
Oh, now, why would we do that?
They hired a '90's cover band.
Uh, we have to go...
[CHUCKLING]
By the way,
Alex, congratulations on your coverage of the blizzard last month.
I'm sure you'll win some awards for that.
Well, you know what?

I just like helping people.
That's...

They needed this in time for new year's Eve.
Oh, I'm so glad you're going to see this.
[LAUGHING]
Funny... talented and gorgeous?
How did I ever get so lucky?
I'm the lucky one.
Oh... [♪♪♪]
You know what...
Just excuse me for a minute.
Hey!
Hey.
Let's go on the balcony.
The balcony?
Yeah.
Okay.
Ohh...
Here.
Thank you.
You know, that's funny.
This almost looks like the balcony from your ad.
Does it?
MAN:

Oh, here we go.
JOINING IN WITH CROWS:

One!
Happy new year!
Happy new year!
Happy new year, sweetie.
Oh!

You probably want...
This.
[CHUCKLES]
[CLINK] Cheers.
[♪♪♪]
Wait, where's the--?
You didn't...
You didn't drink it, did you?
Yeah, I know...
I expected a better vintage, too.
Maybe we should've gone to the burtons' after all.
[CHUCKLES]
You ready to go back in?
I think he's gone.
Who?
This old friend from college.
He's always trying to get me to invest in his semi-legal pyramid scheme.
I just-

[EXHALES] Right.
Of course.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

Hey.
This is going to be a big year for both of us, Gwen.
We're both going to hit the big time.
Together.
Just like we always planned.
I love you.
Love you, too.
Come on.
[♪♪♪]
I can't believe he didn't do it.
Did he say anything?
Just that this was gonna be a big year for us.
Oh!

He's just waiting for your birthday party next week so all your friends can be there.
You think?
I'm positive.
That's what you said last night.
Did I?
Oh, it's hard to remember.

[LAUGHS]
[SIGHS]
My birthday.
[PUFFS]
Yeah!
Thank you!
What did you wish for?
That we could be done with this so I can get home and get ready for my party!
Don't worry, I'll help you get ready.
Let's go, let's go!

Thank you, Bruce.
Great spread, by the way.
Well, you know how I like to immerse myself in the product.
Lucky for us, we had a chain of bakeries this week.
Mm!

Oh, wait.
Are any of these vegan or gluten-free?
No...
You're the best.

[LAUGHS]
[GASPS] Thank you.
Happy birthday.
Impressive flowers.
Liberal use of carnations.
Is there something wrong with carnations?
No!

[SCOFFING CHUCKLE]
And what kind of flowers do you get your girlfriend?
I try to avoid those.
-Flowers?

Oh?

I might have some friends that...
DAVE:

I've had a bit of a bad run.
I'm kind of on a self-imposed dating hiatus.
Bad breakup?
Bought her carnations.

Ha, ha.
[CLEARING THROAT]
Excuse me.
A bit of a problem.
The actress doesn't actually want to eat the cookie.
What?

Does she-- does she have food allergies?
No.

Huh.
She has to eat the cookie!
It's the crux of the commercial!
In the commercial, the couple is fighting.
He goes to the bakery and brings her something.
She takes a bite, and, suddenly, he turns into...

She has to eat the cookie!
I will fix this.
[♪♪♪]
Just watch the master at work.
[♪♪♪]
All set.
What'd you do?
I just gave her one of the high-protein cookies.
We have those?
CALLS OUT:

[♪♪♪]
Wow.

But I checked to see if she had food allergies.
And I prefer "resourceful."
Lock... it... up.
CALLS OUT:

Resourceful.

Yeah, no, that's good.
Oh!

It's from Alex.
Oh...
Oh!
No numbers.
Timeless.
And... action!
[MOUTHS WORD]
[RUSTLING]
Ooh.
Practical.
Oh!
Not practical.
[♪♪♪]
[POP]
Cut!
My bad.
And... cut!
BRUCE: 'Kay.

Can you help me bring these out?
Happy birthday.
Have fun at your party.
Thanks!

Oh, thanks, but it's karaoke night with the copywriters.
If I don't get there early, they will steal my journey song.
"Don't stop believing"?
Oh, no, that's for hacks.

"Patiently." Probably haven't heart of it.
"Infinity" album, 1978.
Wow.
I did not have you pegged for a classic rock person.
Ah, I used to be.
Alex and I don't really go any place that has karaoke.
Ah.

[AWKWARD CHUCKLE]
See you.
Bye!
MUTTERS: "Opera-oke."
It's funny.
[TEXT ALERT CHIMES]
That's the event planner.
Everything is good to go.
I will meet you guys after dinner with Alex.
Where's he taking you?
Avenue 16.
Everyone gets engaged there.
That's where Nolan proposed to me.
Is it?
[INHALES DEEPLY]
[BOTH SQUEAL-GIGGLING]
[BOTH EXHALING DEEPLY]
Alex, this is wonderful.
Thank you.
And thank you for everything you sent today.
You really do have perfect taste.
Well, you deserve whatever you want on your birthday, baby.
Oh, here are the drinks.
Thank you.
Cheers!
[CLINK]
[CHUCKLES]
[EXHALES CONTENTEDLY]
It's good, right?
Hmm.
[♪♪♪]
Y-you know, y... [♪♪♪]
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I'm fine.
Well, that's nice.
Is it new?
It's the watch you gave me today.
Right.
Of course it is.
You didn't pick it out, did you?
I might've had just, like, a little bit of help.
What about the flowers?
Uh...
-The bag?

Did you not pick out anything?
Uh...
Who did?
My intern.
What?
Look, I just wanted to make sure you'd like them!
You know I'm terrible at that kind of stuff.
It just...
But...
I did pick out one more thing on my own.
A very...
Special...
Birthday present.
[♪♪♪]
♪ Ta-dah!

[LAUGHS]
[♪♪♪]
It's a smart phone for your finger!
[LAUGHS] Here!

[RING BUZZING]

What...
Finger do I put it on?
Whichever one you want.
[CHUCKLING]
[SIGHS]
[♪♪♪]
Beautiful.
[DANCE MUSIC THUMPING]
Alex?
Just one second.
Hey, I'm not really feeling so well.
I think I'm just going to go home.
But it's your birthday party.
Alex...
Okay, yeah, I'm sorry, babe.

I'll take you home.
No.
No, you should stay.
Make sure everybody has a good time.
Mia can drive me.
Are you sure?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

You bet!

[CHUCKLES]
[FORCED LAUGH]
[♪♪♪]
I just want to know.

I do.
You've had that "life to-do" list since you were 13.
My entire world collapsed the year my dad died, and I never wanted to feel out-of-control.
That's why I made all these lists.
And everything has gone exactly how I planned it, up until now.
So what are you going to do?
[SIGHS]
I don't know.
[♪♪♪]
[TV BEGINS PLAYING]
[FOOTSTEPS]
Alex?
[CLICKS TV OFF]
Oh!
Oh.

Dave?

[CHUCKLES]
I was at dinner around the corner, with some friends, and, well, they had this huge protein-power-cookie on the dessert menu.
I thought it was funny.

I thought you'd still be at your party, so I was just gonna drop it off with the, uh, storyboard.
Really funny.

That's very nice.
Why aren't you at your party?
Are you okay?
Yeah.

The, uh, bakery people from the commercial told me they made you a huge cake.
I bet that was great.
I tried to bribe them to put a trick candle on it, they wouldn't go for it.
I kind of left before that part.
Why?
I'd rather not say.
Oh.
Sorry.

[♪♪♪]
Do you have a match?
Why?
Trust me.
♪ Ta-dah!

[LAUGHS]
No one should have a birthday without blowing out...
A candle.
Make a wish.
I've been told that it sets a tone for the entire year.
I said that, didn't I?
Yup.
And as somebody who'll be working with you on a daily basis, take one for the team.
Okay.
What'd you wish for?
I'm not telling you.
Come on.
You know that jinxing-it thing is a myth.
You know what?
Fine, I will tell you, because it's impossible to have come true.
I wished that I could see exactly what my life looked like in 10 years.
Isn't not knowing what makes life fun?
Not for me.
I like knowing what to expect at all times.
Hmm.
Well...
Thanks again for the cookie.
Yeah, you're welcome.
Good night.
'Night.

Actually, it's e-d-f, z-z-p.
What is going on?
I have had perfect vision.
You're not Dr. corben.
I'm subbing in for him when he's away on a cruise.
Getting away from the cold, you know?
So, have you started any new medications?
Had any recent... head trauma?
No.

Hmm.
I'm going to put some drops in your eyes.
It'll make everything a little bit blurrier for a bit, but in a moment, you'll see everything a lot more clearly.
Chin here, please.
[♪♪♪]
GIRL:

GWEN:

I said he didn't know I was allergic.
I know.
I love you.
I love you, too.
[WHOOSH]
Whoa!
Are you okay?
What was in those eye drops?
Just something to help you see more clearly.
There's something seriously wrong with those.
And how is your vision now?
It's okay...

Now.
You're welcome.

TO SELF:

It was a hallucination from the light or lack of sleep.
Hey.

I... [♪♪♪]
MIA:

Mm-hmm.

I'm not sure that's possible.
I had a macadamia nut allergy.
What?

I know!
And... get this!
I had three kids.

I barely even want one.
And...

Alex and I always said that we would stay in the city or move to the beach.
Except you weren't married to Alex, you were married to Dave.
Stop saying that.
Gwen, it's not like he's some kind of hideous monster.
He's a good-looking guy, and he's nice to everyone, he's funny...
Why are you talking about this like this is a real thing?
It was obviously some light- or eye-drop-induced hallucination.
Of course it is.
Okay, let's do this!
All right.

Barbecue one.

Hold the roll!
I just-

It needs more of a build.
Oh, here we go.
Just give me one minute.
One minute.

[♪♪♪]
Okay, let's go!
Do you want to tell me what's going on?
Nothing.

I meant with the blocking.
That'll be fine, too.

It's all yours for as long as you want it.

Maybe you should see a doctor.
No, no, no.

I'm probably just hungry.
Oh.

I knew it wasn't real.
I don't think they make imitation macadamia nuts.
You know what?

I feel much better now.
I feel much better now.
[♪♪♪]
No.
No, no, no!
No!

Gwen, are you allergic to macadamia nuts?
DARKLY:

Yep!
You're allergic to macadamia nuts.
But I never was before!
It's perfectly normal to develop an intolerance later in life.

And try to stop scratching.
Do you know what this means?
Do not say it.
I have to!
What if your vision is really coming true and marrying Dave is your fate?
I don't believe in fate.
I control my own destiny, Mia.
I still believe that.
Okay.

Lie in a tub full of oatmeal.
Good call.

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]
Hey!
Hey.
Where have you been?

Why aren't you dressed?
We have that animal rescue benefit, remember?
No, I can't go.
Apparently, I have developed an allergy to macadamia nuts.
What?

Yeah, my entire body is one big itch.
Oh, you look miserable.
Don't they have, like, any medicine you can take?
This is 90% better than what it was.
Yikes.
Well...

I mean, the station did want me there to represent them, but...
It's okay, i-I'll tell them you're sick.
No!

It's great publicity.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Thanks, babe.

Okay.

See ya.
[SIGHS]
[CLICKS TV ON]
[KNOCKING AT DOOR]
I am so glad you changed your mind!

Hi.
I-i know coming over here again seems vaguely, well, creepy, but I wanted to see how you were doing.
I felt responsible for, you know, causing this to happen.
I am much better.

Good.

I realize soup isn't necessarily helpful with an allergic reaction, but, well, I didn't know if we were good enough friends for me to drop by with a tube of hydrocortisone.
You don't think we're friends?
I'm not sure.
You just brought me hot soup on a cold winter night.
You are in.
Yes!
[LAUGHING]
Uh, well, I should get going.
I'm sure Alex is already taking great care of you.
No.

We had a thing he went to.
I told him to go.
But you wanted him to stay.
Right.
And just because we're officially friends now doesn't mean you can ask me that.
You're right.

My bad.
Um...
Well, if you need anything, don't hesitate to call.
Okay.
The soup?
Oh!

Here you go.
Thanks.
Good night.

We could've just bought a cake.
Are you kidding me?
We always bake a cake together on your birthday!
I'm just sorry i couldn't make the party.
You didn't miss a thing.
Well, so, obviously, he didn't ask me.
So you move on.
I can't just move on, mom.
We've been together for three years.
We've made plans.
Plans change.
Not mine.
I don't want change.
I don't want surprises.
I need to know what to expect.
Gwen, I understand.
After your dad died, all you wanted was to feel in control of your future.
But all I wanted was for you to know you that you can take care of yourself, even if the unexpected happens.
And you're doing that!
You're smart, you're kind, you're doing what you love...
Just let the rest unfold in its own time.
[♪♪♪]
You need to sit him down and talk to him, Gwen.
You deserve to know where things stand.
No, you're right.
We're having dinner tomorrow.
I will talk to him then.
But...
Tomorrow is tomorrow.
And, today...
You only have one job, and that is to destroy this beautiful cake.

Mr. stone, we finally received our case of '89 chateauneuf-du-pape.
Fantastic!
We'll take a bottle.

Oh.

I should've asked if you wanted something else.
Uh, maybe a Merlot, or--?
No, what i-- what I want is to talk about our future.
Just one second, please.
Gwen...
Sweetie...
I definitely want to talk about that, okay?
But maybe it's better if we did it privately.
We're at a table for two.
Just you and me.
Well, yes, in the middle of the most popular restaurant in the city.
I'll tell you what.
We'll go to that gallery opening over the weekend, and we'll go someplace quiet for brunch after, and then we can talk.
But tonight, right now, let's just try to have a nice time.

Why wouldn't talking about our future be "nice"?
We've been together for three years.
-Wouldn't you want--

I know what you're going to say, okay?
And you don't have to worry.
It'll happen.
I'm just...
I'm just waiting for the absolute perfect moment.
I just want to do it right.
We are going to have it all, Gwen.
We will be the couple that everyone else wants to be.
Just be patient.

I just really want to check my vision again in the-- in the machine.
Okey-dokey.
[EXHALES DEEPLY]
Everything looks good.
Let's try this.
Cover your right eye and read the chart from left to right.
[WORDS CATCH]
Doctor,
I'm sorry, is there any way that there might be a carbon-monoxide leak in the office or something?
Of course not.

No reason.
I'm gonna go.
Okay.

Oh, good!

...MACADAMIANUTS.
Go play!
[DOG BARKING]
Hey!
Is that...

Oh, yeah, that's, uh, that's Max.
Didn't expect to see you here.
Oh, I didn't-- i didn't come on purpose.
I was just walking by.
Coincidence.
Personally, I don't believe in coincidences.
I think everything happens for a reason.
Well, I believe that we have control over things that happen.
You make a plan, and then you do it.
Okay.
Well, I figured you might want to see the dogs, figure out the best way to shoot them.
In there?

Okay, what gives?
Why are you so nervous around dogs?
When I was a kid, i got bitten.
It's a good reason, right?
I'm sorry.

Bad enough for me to be nervous about them now.
I know dogs are great, everybody loves dogs, but...
It's my thing.
It's a weird thing, everybody has one.
No, not me.

Oh, come on.
Okay.
I, uh...
I have a fear of getting sick from eating street food.
When I was ten, i had a taco.
It was a very bad night.
Okay, but what are the chances that that is gonna happen again?
I could say the same thing to you.
Oh...
Maybe it's time to take a risk.
Make some changes.
I'm not big on change.
Try it.

You might even be happier.
Come on!
Yeah, I'm not ready.
Mm-mm.
Okay.
Sure thing.
Bye!
Nice.

[PHONE RINGS]
Uh, answer phone.
Hello?
Gwen, it's Mia.

IDO, but before you make fun of me, this isn't about the "vision" thing."
It's about the heated seats.
And the onboard Wi-Fi.
And the new-car smell.
Noted.
Why?

BECAUSEI KINDOF  NEEDA HUGEFAVOR.
I was supposed to drop off my nieces and nephew at school this morning, because my sister's sick, but my car just broke down.
You know I wouldn't ask if it wasn't an emergency.
No, I'll be right there.
THANKYOU.
Gwen, these are my nieces maddy and Lilly, and my nephew, Ellis.

TOGETHER:

Very funny.

She's helping us this morning.

It's only a ten-minute drive.
Do you hate me for doing this to you?
No, really, it's fine.

Thank you, Gwen.

Then I'm gonna check on the lighting.
Gwen... [SIGHS]
[♪♪♪]
Okay, here we are.
What is this?
Well, did you know the trainer doesn't just do film and television?
He also works with therapy dogs, and when they're puppies, they need to start to learn to be gentle around people.
So where are you going with this?
Well, it turns out that some of the puppies are here today.
No.
-Come on.

It's just one little puppy.
I'll be with you the whole time.
[PUPPY WHINES]
I think it's way better if you just faced your fear.

HUH, WELL, THAT NOTHING IS REALLY SOMETHING.
MUTTERS, TO SELF:

MIA:

Did something happen with Alex?
No.
I think I might...
Have feelings for Dave.
Oh!

No, it's not!
I-i have a boyfriend.
I thought you were rooting for us!
It doesn't matter what I think.
But I see you and Dave together, and I don't know!
Does that vision you saw really seem so far-fetched now?
Mia, I can't throw away the future that I planned because of vision i saw at the eye doctor.
I mean, it's probably all just a coincidence, and this isn't fair to Alex.
He has done nothing wrong.
But that doesn't mean the two of you are right.
Well, maybe I can't give my all to Alex because I'm spending too much time with Dave.
Well, you guys work together.
There's nothing you can do about that.
[♪♪♪]
What did you do?
Nothing!
I may have recommended Dave for a directing gig next week, but it's no big deal.
You got him a new job just to get him away from you?
No.
No!

He told me that he wanted to start directing, so I just made a couple of calls.
And i-it's j-just for the week.
Now this will give me more time to breathe and look at things objectively.
Wow.
I never thought I'd see Gwen Turner so scared.
Of what?
The truth?
Change?
Your heart?
Director's choice.
[♪♪♪]
Cut!
[SHOT BELL RINGS]
C-cut.
[SCOFFS] I said that already.
That's not your job.

The lights are too bright.
It's an infomercial.
The light has to be bright it will be airing in the middle of the night and we want people to stay awake.
The model has been complaining about the heat on set.
Tch!
Okay, are you trying to film a commercial or get a date to the prom?
Maybe we should've hired a male director,
'CAUSE HE WOULD GET THAT WE'RE NOT SELLING THE SHAKE, we're selling the body that you get from the shake.
[ASTONISHED CHUCKLE]
Okay, I'm sorry, did you just time-travel from an ad agency from 1961?
[SCOFFS]
What're you doing?
I'm texting the agency to let them know that if they ever put me on another one of your accounts,
I will never work for them again.
[SCOFFS]
He's no Dave.
[MOCKS SCOFFING]
I know, I know.
[♪♪♪]
Mm!
This is incredible, babe.
What's the occasion?
Nothing.

Mm-hmm.
Mm...
Mm!
Hey!

I have an audition.
For w-- for what?
An anchor job, of course.
And then if you get this job, then what?
It's "L.A., here we come."
Alex, you know that i won't move to L.A. with you unless we're more fully committed.
Okay, well, you know what?
I don't have the job yet, so why worry about something that hasn't even happened?
I didn't even know that you were worried about it at all.
Babe!

Together!

Don't worry, I'm not going to leave you behind.
I promise.

[LAUGHS] What are you doing here?
Well, what else would an aspiring director
BE DOING ON SATURDAY THAN SEEING HIS GIRL FRIDAY?
Well, you're not "aspiring" anymore.
How was this week?
They, uh, they actually want to hire me again.
I'm not surprised.

You're happy for me?
Of course!

I want to ask you something, because, if I don't, it's just, it's gonna eat at me.
Did you get me that directing job so that you could get rid of me?
How did you know that I helped you get it?
Someone at the agency mentioned it, but you didn't answer the question.
I just thought that it would be a great opportunity for you.
So you did it for my future?
Mm-hmm.
The thing is, I always...
Saw my future with you.
Professionally speaking.
Did you think that I meant-- no!

Of course not.
Are you sure?
Why?

Would it be okay if it was?
I can't answer that.
Then it isn't what I meant.
Okay.

Okay.

We would've invited you, but you're usually off doing something fancy with Johnny volcano.

Oh!

We just didn't figure it was your style.
"Johnny volcano." I see the nickname has stuck.

That isn't helping anything, Mia.

This weekend.
Ranch dressing.
Wow!
That's great, Dave.
I'm really happy for you.
And you know, since I'm so in demand as a director now,
I'm not sure when we'll be back working together, so...
Any chance we can play trivia together again?

The other guy will do the exterior stuff.
Okay.

And we're walking.

What happened to your ranch dressing?
Well, the agency called me this morning and asked me to fill in here instead.
I really wish someone told me that you were coming up.

You've been camping though, right?
Does a cabin with indoor plumbing and Internet access count?
No.
Then, I don't quite see the appeal.
Quiet reflection.

S'mores!
Mosquitos, bears, alien abductions.
My dad was going to take me, but that never happened, so I guess I just crossed it off my list.
You know, not everything you do has to be on your list.
But I like it like that.
Then I know what to expect.
Isn't what makes life interesting the unexpected?
What about your family?
Normal, stable, happy family.
Not that my childhood was perfect.
Our house actually burned down when I was a kid.
I'm sorry.
No, don't be.
Taught me that the things that we surround ourselves with
ARE JUST THAT...

But I found out something so important about myself.
I love acting.

Nope, I have two lines, but it's a start!

I want to move to Los Angeles, you know, make a real go of it.
With you by my side.
When would this move happen?
Next week?
Seriously?
Why not?
I mean, you can direct commercials out there, and then start making connections with the studios.
It's what we always talked about, right?
Not... not exactly, Alex.
I mean, i don't really even know if my dream is to direct big-budget movies anymore.
Maybe I want to make documentaries.
You know, really make a change in the world.
You don't-- you don't need to be in L.A. for that.
Documentaries?
Gwennie...
Those don't make any money.
Alex, that's not the point.
Then what is the point?
Are you saying you don't want to move to L.A. anymore?
L.A. isn't the problem, Alex.

That's all you ever talk about.
I am so sorry if I ever pressured you.
I think that i just couldn't admit to myself that it was over.
We just don't want the same things anymore.
[BAFFLED CHUCKLE]
So you're actually saying no?
What am I supposed to do right now?
You know, a wise woman just told me that everyone should follow their own path.
What?
I have to go.
Where?
To follow mine.
Hey!
Do you guys know where Dave went?
He left.
He seemed very upset.
Why would you get engaged to someone else?

What are you doing here, Gwen?
I wanted to tell you.
What?
What could you possibly have to say to me?
You got engaged to the wrong guy.
I know it, you know it.
I can't believe you said yes.
But Dave, that's what I've been trying to tell you!
I said no.
But I saw him put a ring on your finger.
And then what happened?
I don't know.
I couldn't stick around to watch it.
I told him that it was over.
Wow.
I kinda wish I'd stuck around to watch that.
What made you change your mind?
When I finally realized that planning my whole life out didn't make me any happier.
You know, when I was with Alex,
I always felt like we were putting on a show.
You know, "the perfect couple."
But...
When I'm with you, I'm just me.
I'm happy.
When I saw Alex propose to you...
I thought every vision I had for my future was over.
If you're saying we have a chance...
What I'm saying...
Is that I'm falling in love with you.
When I'm with you, i feel safe, and I know this is where I belong.
It's just, I don't know why it took so long to realize it.
Yeah.
It felt like an eternity, because I fell for you the first time I saw you on set.
You're brilliant.
You're beautiful.
I've been waiting my whole life for you.
