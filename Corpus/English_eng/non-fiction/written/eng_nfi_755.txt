Previously on " Criminal Minds"
They just charged Reid with the murder of Nadie Ramos.
Bail is denied.

He's in prison?
You're going to give yourself a concussion.
Beats what they'll do to me inside.
Aah!

You, you need to show some respect.
Back off.
Now.
All right, inmates, go, out of your racks.
Out!
What happened?
Welcoming committee.
You ok?
I am right now.
It's later I'm worried about.
Anything I can do to help?
Yeah.

Pixie dust you got sprinkled on you.
This ain't social hour.
Get back to work.
- Hi.

No touching.
Is everything ok?

No.

She asked about you.
Cassie said she was having a really good day.
Where did you, uh, tell her I was?
Uh, the beach.
Well, she asked if that's where you were.
It seemed to make her happy, so...
Good.

How are you doing?
I'm ok.
I, uh, I'm really happy to see you.
I just...

It's not a good idea.
Sorry.

Garcia has us on shifts, and she of course took first dibs, but, uh, they needed her in the office for a case,
So I was the lucky one.
A case?

The last time I saw you,
I promised you would not be alone.
I am just trying to keep up the best way I can.
What's the case?
What?
The case.

Unless it's local.

No.

You really want to hear this?
Yeah.

Besides, you know, this.
Ok.
Um...

Which is the third in the last 6 weeks.
He dumps them in alleys.
All female, in their 20s.
Equal opportunity.

Oh, and the media's having a field day.
They're calling him the Bone Crusher.
Gigi Stevens, 26-year-old waitress from Brooklyn.
Cause of death was loss of blood from all the compound fractures.
This one tore her femoral artery.
That was probably what did it.
But I did find a few postmortem fractures as well.
What about a tox screen?
We found traces of alcohol and MDMA in her system.
It's exactly like the first two victims.
Any sign of sexual assault?
None.
Breaking bones is what gets him off.
No, no more.
Wait, you think she's only been dead 24 hours?
Yeah, maximum.
Well, she went missing a week ago.
That meant he held her for several days.
He didn't do that with his other victims.
He abducted, killed, and dumped them all within a two-day period.
Holding her means a lot more work for him.
Oh, he was busy, all right.
He broke all her fingers and toes first.
But the big breaks he saved for last.
So, he's a sadist
Who's learned how to prolong his pleasure
By keeping her alive.
But the torture must mean something
If he's willing to risk holding her.
Aah!
All of these women were educated and gainfully employed.
Totally low-risk lifestyles.
Yeah, but they were all found at bars and night clubs, and they each had alcohol and drugs in their system,
So they weren't exactly shrinking violets either.
But drugs and the alcohol are probably part of his ruse.
That means he has social skills.
I bet he charms them in, like Bundy.
I just keep wondering why a sadist
Would use a love drug that makes you feel empathy.
Well, we don't know for sure that he uses it, too.
He may want to maintain focus.
Well, if he's holding them captive now,
He needs space to do that.
Not impossible, but that's not exactly the easiest thing to find in New York City.
He could even be using a small Van or truck.
Excuse me, agents, there's a woman out here
I think you should talk to.
Apparently she came in this morning,
Said she had information for the FBI.
So my guys took her name, number.
She insisted on waiting.
So when I finally sat down with her, she showed me this.
She said her son wrote all that.
She claims he's the Bone Crusher.
*CRIMINAL MINDS Season 12 Episode 16 "Assistance is Futile"
To against conscience is neither right nor safe.
Here I stand.

Martin Luther.
I'd love to get a piece of that, huh?
It's ok.

Hmm?
It's not my first time in a prison.
I can handle it.
Sorry.

I know.

But if that's the price I have to pay to see you,
I'm ok with that.
So, listen, um, there are some other things
We should talk about.
We got your Full Panel Tox Screen results.
Um, they were negative for scopolamine.
How are we gonna prove that scratch is behind all this?
We'll find another way.
Look, it was too late by the time
We took that blood test.
You must have metabolized everything.
He's gonna get away with it.
Spence.
He's gonna get away with it.
We're not gonna let him.
We're gonna get you out of here.
I promise.
And we are gonna get that psychopath
And we are gonna clear your name.
Just, please, keep your head down,
And focus on that.
Ok?
Ok.
You'll have to forgive me, Ms. White.
I mean no disrespect.
But we have very limited resources.
Look, I know you must get a lot of crazies,
But I swear to god, I'm not one of them.
You saw what he wrote, about the girls he sees 0n the subway and on the train.
How he followed them, what he wants to do to them.
And there's more.
I couldn't bring it all.
Plus you should see how it is.
Please, come look for yourself.
Please.
You said you lived in Kingsbridge?
That's not too far from where I grew up.
I could come check it out.
I'll go with.
He lived down here,
But I finally had to kick him out.
Why?
Because he came home one night with blood on him, but he wasn't hurt.
and he wouldn't tell me how it got there.
How long ago was that?
About 6 weeks.
When he didn't come back, I decided I'd clean out
Some of his stuff, you know?
And, uh, that's when I found...
Have you moved or touched any of this stuff?
No.

I'll call prentiss.
What's that?
It's a present from Henry.
So that is you, and that is him.
It's from that day we went to the park.
Tell him it's beautiful.

Visiting hours are over.
Inmates, line up.
Hey.

Let's go.
Her legs were perfect, like a dancer's.
Sinew and tight muscle.

But this is more than just sadism.
This bone-breaking is some kind of psychopathic compulsion.
Can you imagine if it was your kid living down here?
Sometimes he disappears for days at a time.
I don't know where he goes.
This is all my fault.

Oh, no, this isn't your fault.
Yes, I should have gone to the police sooner.
You can't blame yourself, for any of this.
You did the right thing by coming to us when you did.
Listen, I know this is difficult.

We need you to focus right now, ok,
Because we all want the same thing here.
To find Danny.
Ok.
And so let's just start at the beginning.
Why don't you tell us, what was Danny like growing up?
He was a sweet kid.
Normal, you know?
Until his dad left.
Can you tell us about that?
He ran off with our next-door neighbor.
He's not seen him since.
And how old was Danny when his dad left?
11.
He's never been the same.
How so?
He's just so angry.
Always getting in trouble at school.
When was the first time
You knew something was wrong with him?
I mean, really knew.
I guess about 10 years ago when he was 13.
Why are we talking about this?
Like, how is this gonna help find Danny?
Mrs. White, we're not...

We don't just look at fingerprints and evidence.
We look at behavior.
So even the smallest detail of something might be a really big help.
I wanted to paint our old apartment after...
After his father left.
We couldn't afford to move.
And I was painting Danny's room...
Uhh!
I fell off the ladder and broke my arm.
Danny was there, but I didn't see him come in.
Then when I asked him to help me,
He just stood there, laughing.
Is it possible that Danny may have pushed you off that ladder?
Ohh...
By any chance, do you remember the address of that building?
What do you want, newbie?
Still with that?

You need some new material.
Ok, whatever you say...
El nuÃ±o.
Hunky newster.
New kid on the... no, that one's too much on the nose.
All right, whatever.
I need you to check out an address for me.
Sure.

11637 Woodycrest Avenue.
It's an apartment building in the Bronx.
Any criminal activity that might relate to Danny white.
Hold yourself.

Just your garden variety vandalism, drug possession.
It's all pretty standard for a condemned building.
Wait, it's condemned?
Mm-hmm.

It's scheduled to be demolished,
But, uh, something's holding it up.

Thanks, Garcia.

Really?
Available.
Newbie.
So, the apartment building Danny white used to live in
Is abandoned.
Do you have a hunch about something?
Danny grew up in the neighborhood and up until recently lived here with his mom.
So I'm thinking he wants to be at someplace familiar.
And we did profile he'd need a space to do his thing.
An abandoned building would do the trick.
All right, you two go ahead.

She said it was 6c.
You hear that?
Yeah.
Got some bolt cutters in the car.
It's ok.

Everything's gonna be ok.
And that is you, and that is him.
It's from that day we went to the park.
Hey, you.
What's up, my man?
How you doin'?

Don't play that.
Hey, where you goin'?
They're gonna kill him.
Sit down.

No, they won't.
Teach him a lesson, maybe, but they won't kill him.
Be too easy.
How do you know?
'cause I know how they think.
They're testing him.
Want to see if he's going to float or drown.
The rules in here are different.
You don't have a badge or a gun.
Stop fighting it, man.
Ok, we got an I.D. On the victim.
Name's Serena Adams, 25-year-old grad student at nyu.
Exactly his type.
How long has she been missing?
Since yesterday.
He's moving fast.
Looks like he was living here after his mom kicked him out.
He's even got food and water back there.
This guy is somewhere in the city and we're gonna find him.
Daniel Allen white was a demolition contractor.
Which was obviously his way of sublimating his desires.
But it also means that he is highly familiar with condemned and abandoned buildings.
Uh, we can double up on patrols in those areas.
Especially your unmarked units.
We want to catch this guy, not just deter him.
This geographic profile covers the entire city.
He's used all 5 boroughs to either abduct or dump his victims.
He grew up in this apartment
And it took a concerted effort for him to come back here and use it like this.
So, location is important to him.
If he sticks to his pattern, she'll be in her 20s.
He blends in, he appears nonthreatening, and he's attractive,
All traits that immediately lower most people's defenses.
Because of his job, he's also physically strong.
So not only does he have the tools to manipulate his victims,
He has the strength to overpower them as well.
We also think he uses MDMA as part of his ruse.
As you know, MDMA is a popular drug,
Lowers inhibitions, makes for easier targets.
Daniel Allen white will strike again,
Probably sooner rather than later.
we need to find him before he does.
Thank you.
How's it going with the case?
Everything ok with the girl they found?
Yeah, I don't know.

Oh, how's boy wonder?
He's good.
What?

What do you mean?

No, don't tell me everything.

No, of course I want to know.
Tell me everything.

He can't stay in there.
We gotta get him out.
Yeah.

Come here.

His face is all over the news.
Every cop in town is looking for him.
How has no one seen this guy?
We just gotta keep the pressure on and hopefully he'll make a mistake.
Serena Adams is still recovering from surgery,
But she had MDMA in her system
And was last seen at a night club with friends.
We should talk to them.
And we should also talk to Miranda white again.
She's our best lead right now.
Yeah.
Ms. White, thanks for coming back in.
You don't have to be so formal.

Ok, Miranda.

- Yeah.

I-I saw on the news that you found another girl in our old building?
Yeah.
Is she gonna be ok?
She's, uh, she's with her family.
She's going to be fine.

It's right in here.

So when did you and your ex start having problems?
When didn't we?
He was a drinker, among other things.
I should have left that marriage sooner.
Can you tell me more about that?
[music only, no dialogue audio]
But what about Danny?
Was he a drinker?
No.
Maybe he did drugs?
No.
No.
Why would you even think that?
Drug use is something we always have to consider.
Ohh...
Not Danny.
Are you ok?

No.
I'm gonna get us some coffee, all right?
Ok, here you go.
Thanks.
So we're looking for a location
Where an imprint could have been made.
Somewhere Danny maybe used to go with his friends.
Danny never had friends.
What about a girlfriend?
God knows, never.
Never had a girlfriend.
He could never talk to girls.
Cute as he was, he was just so...

And sometimes inappropriate, you know?
Like he had no filter.
That doesn't make any sense.
How do you go from being awkward with no friends
To socially skilled and manipulative?
I don't know.

Or social media.
Maybe it's just some kind of self-help thing and the guy got some confidence.
I don't know.

Living with his mom.
What if we were wrong
And charm's not part of his game?
I don't think so.
All those victims were smart, attractive,
And out in populated areas.
I agree.

And it has to have something to do with the drugs.
Hopefully the media coverage will make it impossible
For him to charm anyone without them recognizing him first.
What can I get you?
A shot of Jack and a beer.
What kind?

Whatever's on draft.
15.
Keep it.
Thank you.
You're never gonna make that shot.
You're really not cool.
Let's get it on.
Trust me... [conversation continues indistinct, music grows louder]
Sweet.
All right, I'm ready.
Unromantic here.
[conversation, song overlapping]
Searching for 23-year-old Bronx native
Daniel Allen white.
White is currently wanted for the recent "Bone Crusher" killings.
3 local women have been murdered in the last 6 weeks.
Try it.
Oh!
[news broadcast continues indistinct]
We have to get a selfie.
Oh, cool, perfect.
- Oh, my God!

clear the run, first tier.
You go.
Open it up!
On the line!
What did they do to him?
He's in the infirmary.
Got a couple of broken ribs.
They could have punctured his lungs.

I told you, it's a test.
Are they gonna leave him alone now?
I didn't say that.
You know, Calvin, you're right.
I don't know prison.
But I do know how to stop a psychopath.
That was out there.
In here, we're all psychopaths.
We have to be, 'cause it's predator or prey.
Which one are you?
What do you want, inmate?
Out of water.

There's no water.

26-year-old Lisa Jackson was abducted last night in Brooklyn.
Apparently she was walking home from a bar with a friend
When a man in an SUV pulled up, attacked them both with a hammer.
Friend wakes up, Lisa's gone.
He only took one of them.
He only needs one.
Plus, two is a lot of work.
Was the friend able to give a description of the attacker?
Yeah.

She said she saw him having drinks at the bar earlier.
He's out drinking.

Or he's just not paying attention to the news.
Or he can't resist the urge to hunt.
Well, what type of SUV did she say?
Dark blue, maybe black.
Said it happened pretty fast.
She got hit in the head pretty good.
I'll have our field office assist in canvassing the area.
Copy that.
This guy, he knows we're onto him.
He's not gonna wait long before he starts breaking bones.
Go sit down.
What was that?
I was thirsty.
I helped you because I like you.
You're interesting to me.
But you keep this up, keep thinking the normal rules
Apply in here, then I cannot help you.
And that would be a shame, because I think
You're the only innocent man in here.
Good luck, brother.
You're gonna need it.
What have you got, Garcia?
Actually, it's me and JJ.
Hey, uh, so I was thinking,
This guy's M.O. Is pretty sophisticated for a killer who's just started out.
Maybe our first victim isn't his first victim.
So I had Garcia compile a list of all the females with bone break injuries in New York City in the last 3 years.
We ruled out women over 30, girls under 18,
Came up with... 112 names.
Did any of them have drugs in their system,
Specifically MDMA?
Oh, so good, new guy, who doesn't feel new because your deep baritone voice comforts me.
The answer is yes.
But not all of them were drug tested,
So we only have two that we know for sure had mdma on board.
Who are they?
Well, there is one in particular that caught my eye.
Nancy Santiago.
She's 22, she's from Long Island, and she died after she fell off a rooftop during a rave almost a year ago.
There any foul play?
Inconclusive.

The police report says two guys saw
What they thought was a male/female couple having sex in the alley behind the rave.
When those two guys spotted them,
He took off, left the female behind.
When they got closer, they saw the girl was actually dead.
The coroner said she had several broken bones from the fall, most notably a compound fracture, super serious, to her femur.
Well, if there was sexual assault,
Do we really think that was our guy?
I want to know more.

Done.
We got a problem.

She's not in the building.
Did you call her?
Yeah.

Maybe she needed some fresh air
- or she got hungry or something.

She said she'd stay put.
Shoot.
Garcia, we need you to track a cell phone.
Hey.
I'm surprised you came home.
You get my texts?
Something I said?

It's just, uh, why is he like this?
What did I do wrong?
No.

Have an affliction, ok?
It's like a sickness.
They either choose to fight it or they embrace it,
And it's no one's fault.
Miranda, another girl went missing.
Now, we still have time to find her,
But we need your help.
And you can help save her just like the other girl.
What can I do?

You know more than you think.
Do you recognize this girl?
Her name is Nancy Santiago.
Now, a year ago, she fell off a rooftop at a rave and she died.
How am I supposed to remember something that happened a year ago?
There was a big thunderstorm that night.
That ring a bell?
Remember how I told you I kicked Danny out
Because he came home with blood on him but he wasn't hurt?
Yeah.
That wasn't the only time that happened.
It happened last year, too,
And it was raining hard that night, and...
Miranda, when I asked you about Danny and the drugs,
It was like you wanted to say something but you couldn't.
Now, I gotta be honest with you.
The one thing that connects all of these victims is the drugs, the MDMA.
Ecstasy.
Something in my gut is telling me that the answer to where Danny is has something to do with that.
I just was trying to help him.
Help him what?
Talk.

God forbid, smile, maybe.
I read these articles about Ecstasy
And how it could help people like Danny.
Did you give Danny the drugs?
At first, just a little.
I mean, he was 21, and I could at least test it and make sure that it was pure and more safe, you know?
And it worked.
He was so happy.
We talked.

Then after a while, it stopped working.
So that's how he went from socially awkward to socially skilled...

That makes sense.

But repeated use could mean addiction
And a higher tolerance, so he would need increasingly larger doses.
His mother was trying to help him,
But she may have unlocked the psychopath in him instead.
MDMA is supposed to enhance sexuality.
If Nancy Santiago was his first victim and he was high when he killed her, that must have made quite an impression.
And since it's never as good as the first time, he's probably been chasing that dragon ever since.
He probably needs to be under the influence himself to complete the experience.
Yeah, but if that was him in the alley
With Nancy Santiago's body, then why no sexual assault with his most recent victims?
Because MDMA can cause impotence.
Yeah.

That's why he's been so violent.
Torture is an outlet for that.
Yeah, what have you got, Garcia?
I've got the 4-1-1 on that rave
That Nancy Santiago was at the night died.
I've sent it all to your tablets.
You can follow along if you wish.
It is a Roving EDM party called Reclamation, and according to their website,
Their mission is to, quote,
" Bring light and rhythm to places long forgotten."
Which means?
Sir, that's the millennial way of saying
" We have illegal parties in abandoned places."
I've seen this somewhere.
Right there.
Abandoned spaces.

Yeah, considering this guy's pattern of late,
That's not a bad idea.
Garcia, is that building still there?
Yeah.

Alvez, Walker, Dave, go.
No!

Shut up.
no!
Shut up!
No!

Aah!
You're gonna break every bone in your body.
No!

Check it out... blood.
I'll call for backup.
Aah!

I want to hear how much it hurts.
Please don't.
Aah!
Did you hear that, the way it cracked?
Let's do another one.
Daniel Allen white, FBI, drop it!
No, no, no, back up.
We can't do that.
Just drop it and let her go.
Back up!
Daniel, just drop it!
I'll take you to see your mother.

Liar.
No.

Her name's Miranda.
How do you think we found your old apartment?
Look, I'm not going to jail.
- Danny, don't.

Don't... don't do it!
Tell my mom I'm sorry.
All right.
Hey.
What are you hammering?
Oh, uh, just hanging up my newest acquisition.
A "W"?
Well, that's not just any old "W".
That, my young friend, is a symbol of victory.
You're not a baseball fan, are you?
Mostly hockey, and I do enjoy a football game.
Well, at Wrigley Field, the home of the Chicago Cubs, they fly that flag after every win.
Wait, you're not even from Chicago.
No.
But I lost a good buddy in Vietnam who was.
And, uh, since they won the world series,
I thought I'd commemorate it for him
Since he didn't live long enough to see it himself.
That's sweet.
Hey, what's going on with you?
Now that I've seen Spence locked up, it... wasn't easy.

Do you know how long it's been since the cubs last won the series?
That's like 100 years, right?
108, to be exact.
Which means that generations lived and died
Without ever seeing a championship.
Can you imagine what that does to your psyche?
Hmm.
But that city and all those fans...
You know what kept them going?
Hope.
Until finally, one night, after over a century of despair,
Hope won.
And that's how we're gonna keep going, until we get that kid the hell out of there.
Hope.
Keep it alive.
'cause I'm afraid right now,
That's all we've got.
"Hope is being able to see that there is light, despite all of the darkness".
Desmond Tutu.
What's up, snitch?
That your girlfriend come to see you?
She's my friend.
You never got any?
What's wrong with you, man?

Help!
Snuff him!
