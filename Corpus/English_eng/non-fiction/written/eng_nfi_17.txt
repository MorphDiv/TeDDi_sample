Tell me something.
What do you know about Wakanda?
It's a third world country.
Textiles, shepherds, cool outfits...
All a front!
Exploreres have searched for it.
Called it El Dorado.
They looked for it in South America, but it was in Africa the whole time.
I'm the only one who's seen it, and made it out alive.
I can see you!
The world, is changing.
Soon there will only be the conquered, and the conquerers.
You are a good man,
With a good heart.
And it's hard for a good man to be a king.
