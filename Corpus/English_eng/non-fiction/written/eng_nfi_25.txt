I wanna make a toast... to the love of my life.
Belle, I wanna tell you something.
I have never been as happy as I am right now.
You're gonna make me cry.
Keep going.
What is it?
♪ And gettin' caught in the rain ♪
I've never felt more alive... ♪ If you have half a brain ♪
...more honest than I do right now.
♪ In the dunes on the cape ♪
♪ I'm the love that you've looked for ♪
I've never felt this free... to be who I am.
And it's because of you.
Uh, honey, have you seen my, uh...?
What?
My...

The, uh...
For what?
The things that you wear when it's really bright outside and you wanna...
My, uh...

♪ Yes, I like Piña Coladas ♪
Kevin?
♪ And gettin' caught in the rain ♪
- I didn't mean to do it, I swear.

- I'm sorry.

Kevin.
Kevin.

You made the right choice.
You need to look forward, not back.
You got the rest of your life ahead of you.
Now, this is what you're going to do.
You're leaving here and driving to the house where it happened.
- I can't go back there, Mr. Gilbert.

- Don't make me go back there.

That's what I'm offering you, a clear path.
You understand that?
- Tell me, say the words.

- No, no, no.

- I understand.

When you get to the house, my guy will be there, okay?
Okay.
He'll need to know everything.

He'll tell you what to do, what you need to say.
Any questions he asks, you tell him the truth.
The whole truth, son.
You leave anything out, you're only hurting yourself.
Okay.
Now get and move on.

So, your guy, it's Luis, right?
- From the boatyard?

Well, how will I know who he is?
He'll be the guy that isn't dead, Kevin.
Oh, my God.

Luis, where you at, man?
Luis.
Shit.
Hey.
Now, why does John Rayburn want me dead?
Who?
John Rayburn.
- I never heard of him.

- do you work for, puto?

Who... the...
- fuck?

Who the fuck is Mr. Gilbert?
He's Roy Gilbert.

I wanna fuck Roy Gilbert.
And you.
No, man.

You didn't do nothing.
You're just doing your job.
You know, I'm gonna let you go, man.
Thank you.
You'll be okay.
As long as you do exactly what I tell you.
I'm here to help you help yourself.
You're gotta take the first step, okay?
Come on inside.
Where are you headed?
North.
North's good.
Where are you coming from?
Two options.
Either you were here, or you weren't.
And if you weren't...

Great.

Yeah, but you were here is the problem.
All depends on how much you can remember.
Can't we just, like, wipe everything down?
Clean the place really, really well?
No, let's, um...
Let's go back, step by step.
What shoes are you wearing?

- Mm, sandals.

No.
- Shorts, pants, t-shirt, tank...

Is that his?

- It's not yours?

Okay.
So... you talk?
Yeah.

I was trying to get him to stop doing what he was about to do.
- So, it was heated?

- You touch your face and all?

Your face, did you touch it at all during the argument?
I don't know.

- Did you touch him?

Good.

Yeah, maybe.
Is that good or bad?
- Sweat's got your DNA.

It's all right.

Um, so, yeah, we keep on arguing, and then, uh... he comes up to my face really close, and he says... some bullshit to me.
And then, um, he threatens me.
And then he turns, and he walks away.
And that's when I...

- I grabbed the thing.

The...

And then, um...
I swear, I just was trying to make him stop, you know?
I just wanted to get him to st...
So, you hit him?
I hit him.
From behind?

Just once.
And then?
And then he went down onto the ground.
And then you hit him again?
- Yeah, I guess.

Maybe it was three.
Oh, Jesus.

I'm gonna be sick.

It's okay, man.

Okay.

Um...
Um...
Yeah, so, then I hit him, and he goes down, and then I just dropped the fucking statue.
Okay, and then?
I-I-I can't remember.
Try.
I was freaking out.
So, did you sit down at all?
No, I don't know.

Okay.

Yeah.
Yeah, I did.
What?
Jesus.
- You touch him?

I pissed myself.
Okay.
- Um, where in the room exactly?

I don't remember.
Everything went black, and then I just...

Yeah, well, that settles that.
- Piss.

I'm assuming you changed out of the clothes you were wearing?
Yes, obviously.
Okay, so, then, piss in your pants now.
Why?
Look, you come in here, you're sweating, you're jittery,
- you got open-toed shoes, shorts, t-shirt.

Zero containment.

God knows what else, then you piss all over the floor?
I mean, the upshot?
We're standing knee-deep in a swamp of Kevin Rayburn.
Then there's your DUI.
- So, you're in the system.

I can't.

- I'm, like, dehydrated.

Oh, boy.
Drink that.
Uh, where's the weapon?
It's safe.
The weapon is safe, man.

No one's gonna find that.
- I need it.

Because nothing gets hidden.

So, either I destroy it, or I plant it.
What do you mean, "plant it"?
One step at a time, okay?
How long is it gonna take you to get me the weapon?
I don't know, 20 minutes.

So, half hour, tops?
- Yeah, sure.

So, you'll be back in half an hour.
Um...
Here, do me a favor.
- I want your phone number.

- Just write it down.

You need a reason for being here, okay?
Marco called you to come over, so I'm gonna call you from that phone in about 20 minutes.
You pick it up, you stay on for half a minute, and then there'll be a record of you guys talking.
What am I supposed to say?
Nothing.
It's just gonna be me on the other end, so, you know, no one's gonna hear it.
All right?
Now let's go.

Wait, who's Eric?
He's been calling and texting all night.
Oh, that's right, that's right.

That's what made me snap.

Eric fucking O'Bannon.
- What is wrong with you?

No, get your own fucking cash.
Fuck.
You piece of shit.

I literally didn't do a fucking thing and no one's gonna fucking believe me.
- Then take the cash.

I have more.
- Where?

Look.
Whatever they fucking tell you... don't believe a word.

Like it always fucking is.
I didn't fucking kill him.
Eric?

Hello?
- Yeah, right.

- Thirty seconds, right?

Okay, what am I supposed to say?
Stop panicking, all right?
Okay, right.

Hang on a bit longer.
Fuck.
♪ Just a perfect day ♪
♪ Feed animals in the zoo ♪
It was John.
No shit.
And you guys helped him.
- And the three of you...

So, do me a favor, all right?
And get the fuck out of my house.
♪ You just keep me hanging on ♪
No!
You made the right choice.
Fuck!
Fuck!
♪ You're going to reap just what you sow ♪
Come on, John.

You've reached John Rayburn.

You've reached John Rayburn.

Fuck.
Doesn't seem like they're getting the hint you're ignoring 'em.
You need more fun in your life.
Oh, yeah?
Or not.
But I'd say so.
Were you always so serious?
Even at my age?
Maybe.
Dude, you gotta just...

You know, live your life.
Go on and be a bad boy for once.
That your wife?
No.
Got anyplace you really gotta be right now?
No.
So, come party with us.
Where are you going?
Say yes, and I'll tell you.
Trust me, you'll like it.
You want me to answer it?

No, it's my brother.
- I got a baby brother.

Mm-hm.
He's starting high school.
Such a pain in the ass.

Fucking things up.
Fucking things up.
- Hey, hey, baby bro.

- Oh, fuck.

- Where have you been?

You know what?

- What the fuck do you want?

- I've been calling you.

Don't hang up, please.

I have to tell you, something really bad has happened, John.
Some really, really, really bad shit.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck, John.
It's Marco, John.
Marco's dead.
He's dead, John.
- Give me a minute.

Kevin.
I don't know what happened.
I went over to Marco's house.
I didn't have an option.

And now he's...
He's just laying there.

What the fuck do you mean you didn't have a choice?
Now Roy Gilbert's guy is waiting for me over at Marco's, but I don't fucking know.
Kevin, what the fuck are you talking about, Gilbert?
Roy Gilbert.

And he says that this guy says that he can help me fix it.
But I don't know, man.

I think he's gonna fuck it up.
Kevin, you listen to me.
Listen to me.

I don't want you to talk to anyone, I don't want you to do anything,
I don't want you to agree to anything, you stay right where you are.
- Okay, okay.

Um...

- Stay there.

- You understand me?

It doesn't matter where I am!
- You stay right there.

Can you what?
I gotta get a drink, man.
I'm so thirsty, dude.
Listen to me, you fucking asshole.
You stay right where you are.
Stay where you are, let me get there, and I promise I'll do everything I can to help you.
But don't you fucking leave where you are right now, you hear me?
Okay, great.
I need you, John.
Answer the fucking phone.
John?
- Who else knows?

Come on, just get here.

- Meg?

She doesn't know shit.
Kevin, does Mom know?
I didn't know what else to do.

I was calling all night, but you weren't picking up.
So, don't you fucking blame me, all right?

It's not my fucking fault, okay?
This shit never would've happened, man, it never would've happened... if you didn't do what you fucking did.
John?
John?
John...
Hi there.
Where you been?
Where you been?
John.
Detective Rayburn.
Thank you for doing this.
Just when you get a few days off, huh?
Shit always happens.
Take your eye off the ball for a hot second...
My wife had to go to the emergency room last year, too.
Middle of the night.
Appendix burst.
I'll get you home as fast as possible.
Kevin.
Where was it in the room?
Um...

Okay.
So, listen, man.

My brother John, he's a cop, and, uh... he doesn't want me to do anything until he gets here, so...
Okay.
So, I think we should just really wait for him.
Okay, he knows you're here?
Yeah.
And when is that gonna be?
- Not long.

- Soon.

Um...
Fuck.
Fuck, I...

He thinks I'm at Mile Marker 80.
It's where I called him from.

- Kevin.

- I don't...

Listen, listen.

You came in, you saw somebody standing over the body.
Whoever that was killed Marco.
They saw you, they got scared, they ran.

I just...

I think we should wait until he gets here.
That's what we gotta come up with so you can tell a convincing story.
Forensics are top-notch these days.
You know?

Used to be you had to have a story that made sense.

Juries love science, okay?
And the lawyers, they find a story that matches the results.
So, just pick somebody.
I don't know.
- Did he have a girlfriend?

Pissed-off ex?
No, that's my sister.

Well, it doesn't matter.

Are you...?

You know, it's probably already all around here.
Fuck that.

God damn it.
Okay.
Well, who, then?
What about Eric?
It's good, right?
He's been calling, texting.
- He's already on Marco's phone.

All right.
Now tell me what happened.
Okay, so, um...
So, I come in... and, uh, then I see him.
- Who?

And, uh... he's standing over the body.
- Okay.

Standing here like this.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
And then I come in and he runs off.
Yeah, it's not enough, though.
So, what else?
What if, um, you heard them arguing as you approached the house?
Okay, yeah.

Okay, that's good, but we gotta sell it better.

And by the way, Kevin, this is all your choice, you know?
If you weren't here, I can try to make that work, but if you were here...
I could turn you into a hero.
Okay, yeah.
Right?

Great.
I mean, we got Marco's gun here.
Right.
And, uh...
- we got you standing there.

And then Eric sees you entering the house, he raises the gun.
Yeah, maybe...
Oh, yeah.

What?
That'll sell it, man.
Prove there was another person in the room.
How does him picking up the gun prove he's here?
Because he shot you.
And then you call 911, and you report it.
No fucking way.
Stand still and let's finish this.
We're gonna wait here till my brother gets here.
Listen, do not fucking shoot me.
My gas.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Hi, Mom.
- My gas.

It's...
You got gas?
My gas.
Your gas is out.

We got a tank.

Empty.
It's empty?

Chelsea's supposed to bring you fresh ones.
It's not supposed to be empty.
Where am I supposed to get one in the middle of the night?
Hospital.
Okay.

She isn't picking up.
You need to go.
- Hospital.

I love you.

You gotta hold this thing in your nose, put your hand up there.
It'll be okay, okay?

You're gonna keep calling Chelsea.

Just keep calling her, okay?
You little cunt.
I heard that, Mom.
Come on, answer, you fucking fuckwad.
Ozzy, I got your fucking payday for you, dude.
I got John Rayburn served up to you like a pig on a fucking silver fucking stick.
He's done some seriously bad fucking shit, and he's not gonna get away with it if we act fast.
So, you gotta fucking call me.
So, fucking call me.
Hey, that, um...?
That polar freeze?
Is that the one that turns your tongue all blue?
Wha...
What was that?
Yeah, probably.
Okay, good.

What size?
Um... large.
- Okay, Kevin...

Fuck this, man.

I'm done here.
I'm gonna go back home, get John, then we'll come back here.

Kevin, if you move, I can't guarantee where the bullet will strike.
So, just stand still.
All right?

- Fuck you.

Fuck.

- Ow.

I told you to stand still.
You...

You fucking shot me!
No, I didn't.
Listen to me.

We don't have a lot of time.

- Get an ambulance.

What the fuck, man?
Okay, Kevin?
Listen, man.

I need you to call 911 and report this.

I can't.

Okay, all right.
- I don't feel my legs.

Okay, now, listen.
I need you to dial and call 911 now.
- I don't feel...

I need you to dial 911 now, okay?
Oh, fuck.
911.

- Answer her.

- Answer her.

If you need the fire department, press two.
If you need an ambulance, press three.
Is there someone there with you who can give me an address?
I just heard shots fired.
Hello?
If you can hear me, just stay on the line.
911.

I just heard shots.

Can you give me the address, sir?
It's a cop's house.

The police department is on the way, sir.
Stay in your house and lock your doors and windows.

We got a male vic, he's clear.
Come on, let's move.
We got a faint pulse.
Bullet's still lodged.
Sir?

Please respond to me.
Rayburn.
What was that address again?
How's the BP?
It's dropping fast.
Push more fluids.
We gotta stop the bleeding...
- Keep pressure on the arm.

Take a left up here.
Oh, what the fuck?

John.
One victim deceased, Detective Diaz, and one shot is your brother.
What the fuck are you talking about, my brother?
- You didn't know?

- The fuck are you talking about?

Marco sho...
Looks like he was beaten.
Blunt force head trauma.

Kevin is on his way to Island Village.
He took two rounds.

Did he say anything?
No.

He was unconscious when the unis arrived.
John, go be with your brother.
We'll handle things here.
I ju...

- Suspects?

We gotta start working the scene.
Kevin.
Hey, hey, hey.
We're in this together, John.
We'll get the motherfucker.
Fuck.
It's Marco, John.
Marco's dead.
I didn't have an option.

And now, Roy Gilbert's guy is waiting for me over at Marco's, but I don't fucking know.
Kevin, what the fuck are you talking about?
Gilbert.

Listen to me.

I don't want you to talk to anyone, I don't want you to do anything,
I don't want you to agree to anything, you stay right where you are.
It's not my fucking fault, okay?
This shit never would've happened, man, it never would've happened if you didn't do what you fucking did.
Hey, um...
Neighbor over there is the one that called after hearing shots.
Your brother called 911, but he was unable to give an address.
Neighbor didn't see anything.
We're going door to door right now.
Yeah.

Any other angles?

No.
Anyone getting out of prison?

Fuck, Carol, I don't know.
I gotta say it 'cause I'm thinking it, okay?
Diana and the kids okay?
They're safe?
Yeah, they're at home in bed asleep.

I already dispatched a patrol.
'Cause whoever did this could be targeting you, too.
Thank you.
His, uh, next of kin?
I'll do it.
Excuse me.
Anything else I can do for you?
I need your car.
Sure.

Got anything?
Yeah.

Hey, John.
I'm sorry about your baby brother.

- Hello?

I'm not in the mood.
Oh, come on.
- Who's there?

Well, for starters...
I need a goddamn shower.

- Still in Miami, right?

- I'll see you soon.

Is John okay?
The doctor will be right with you.
Excuse me, I was promised an update from Dr. Vasson.
Could you please contact him?
He's in surgery.
Belle.
Oh, my God.

Kev...
John sent an officer to get me.

They won't tell me.

He's in surgery, and they said that he was at Marco's.
- He's what?

I don't know.

Where's Meg?

- I don't know.

- Okay, I got it.

Is he out of surgery yet?
- They won't tell me anything.

Dr. Vasson wanted to tell you your husband made it through his first surgery.
They've stopped the bleeding from one of the wounds, and they're working on the second one now.
It'd be helpful to know if any of you have Kevin's blood type to donate just in case.
I think Meg does.

When he gets out of surgery, give me a call, I'll come back.
- Miami Baptist has the best doctor...

- I don't know.

- Could you have him transferred to Miami?

- That's exactly what I'm gonna try to do.

Oh, my God.
Please record your voice message.
Whatever you did... whatever happened, you better pray my son is gonna be all right.
And fucking call me back, Roy.
Hey.
Meg.
John?
John, is that you?
Yeah.
Have you seen Kevin?

You need to come with me to the hospital and give blood.
Kevin's been shot.
You hear me?
Kevin is at Marco's, you know?
I gotta go to work in the morning, okay?
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?
Holy shit.
Yeah, well, you should see the other guys.
Don't fucking sit on my couch.
No, I don't need a doctor.
I have no idea where Roy Gilbert is.

I only have his cell phone number.

I called his home.

Vanishing is his best talent.
Where's Meg?

- God, she's useless.

Place your head between your knees and sit down.
Would you just stop ordering me around?
I just need water.
You want me to get you a glass of water, I'll get you water.
If you have tightness in your chest... we need to call the doctor.
I know everything, John.
Meg told me all of it.
And I don't wanna hear you making excuses for why you did what you did.
I don't want you apologizing to me, or asking me to forgive you for anything you've done.
I just want you to do one thing...

I want you to find who shot your brother.
When you went to Roy Gilbert, what did he say to you?
He said, uh... he had a guy who could help Kevin.
They'd work together and, uh... figure out who... else to blame.
What else did he say about the guy?

No, he said the less I knew the better.
But he'd get Kevin out from under this.
To frame someone else.
Oh.
That's the word.
Frame.
Mom, I...
It's Belle.
Kevin.
Kevin.
Can you hear me?
There are gonna be a lot of questions coming at you.
And you're gonna say, "I don't remember."
Do you understand that?
You're gonna say, "I don't remember."
You're gonna give me a chance to try to figure something out for you.
How's he doing?
In and out.
Well... the surgeon said he's a fighter.
Yeah.
The doc also said when Kevin was coming out of anesthesia... he ID'd the shooter.
Eric O'Bannon.
Eric O'Bannon?
Yeah.
We're ready for you, Detective Rayburn.
Go ahead.

Yeah.
You're stronger than you think.
You're stronger than your family thinks.
We're gonna get through this.
And we're gonna have our baby.
And we're gonna love him.
And we're gonna keep him safe.
And you're gonna watch him grow up.
I love you.
I love you.
