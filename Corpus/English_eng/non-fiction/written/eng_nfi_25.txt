Are you Billie Chase?
Not another disgruntled reader.
Twilight sucked, nothing you can say will change my mind.
You left me a message about help with an article?
Thank you, yes.
Thank you so much for doing this.
Look at you all over the place.
Congratulations to you and your husband.
Like in the deciding game of the 2000 NBA finals,
Kobe fed Shaq all night, in the end Lakers brought home the hardware
By the way, I think Twilight sucked, too.
So, I met this cute, funny guy, and even though i'm so gigantic I can't even see if I need a bikini wax,
I think he was flirting with me.
People chase us.
But in my current state, I can't exactly run, so I got caught.
Anyway, it made me feel really good about myself.
Look, two women with babies.
Wouldn't it be awesome if you're pregnant right now?
And you were fatter than me?
The bloating, the stretch marks, the morning sickness.
I dream about it all the time.
How did the latest baby conversation go with Nick?
He's anxious about responsibility, but is he closer to changing his mind?
No, he's sticking to his guns.
I mean, I know we decided for the first 3 years of our marriage we gonna focus on our careers.
I don't want to say anything, 'cause it has an adverse effect on the quality of his erections.
Yes, anything below "raging" is not acceptable.
You know Nick.
When you convinced him to cut off his ponytail?
He still has it in his drawer.
It's not attached to his head anymore, and that's because of you.
You're right.
So how do we get him comfortable with the idea of being a father?
Zack and I were going to ask you guys to be godparents
Why don't you come over for brunch tomorrow?
We'll get a few mimosas in him and I'll ask.
We just have to time it right.
After two mimosas, he's open-minded.
After three, he blacks out.
Look they're picking up their babies together!
Those are either really cute dogs or ugly-ass babies.
This is just completely blowing my mind.
It's amazing.
What is it?
For the third time, it's eggs.
Eggs!
The chameleon of food.
Will you be scrambled, will you be over easy?
Billie, how's that basketball article going?
Well, a lot more exciting than I expected.
My collaborator appears to be flirting with me.
You think everybody's flirting with you.
So medium pepperoni, and here's some free cinnamon logs for you.
Free logs.
I think we know where it's heading.
Free cinnamon logs are part of the promotion.
Was undressing me with his eyes in the commercial, too?
Billie, that's so funny.
Zack and I were gonna wait till after the baby was born, but we just think you two would make such incredible parents, that we would like you to be our baby's godparents.
Yeah, sure.
'cause it would help us get used to the idea of being parents ourselves.
It just occurred to me.
And we're going to be parents, eventually.
Eventually I'm going to be infertile.
Are we really doing this "i want to have a baby" thing again over eggs benedict?
I think doing it over eggs is completely appropriate.
'cause every month I make one, you do nothing about it and it dies.
This was just intended as a lovely gesture.
which is at least another three years and if you add that...
I'm too mad to be doing math right now.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine!
Billie, Zack, thank you for a lovely brunch.
Yes, we have to do this again sometime.
Because men die first.
That's because they're quitters.
Look, Abby, I know this is important to you,
I think you're going to your dark place kind of quick here.
After all, it's just one fight.
It's not just one fight, okay?
This is an ongoing battle of wills and Nick is ferocious,
I'm sure you can tell.
If you want to get what you want, you're gonna have to be ferocious back.
Remember when Nick got cold feet about getting married 'cause even at 25, his 401 hadn't vested yet?
You and I went off to Cabo.
Gave him some time to think, and he missed you so much he showed up at the airport in a tuxedo.
At first I thought he was a limo driver.
It was so romantic.
Sweetie, you're my sister.
I'll support whatever you want to do, but why don't we try that approach?
You think that'll work?
I'm not sure, but I promise you we will find a solution to this.
Okay, seriously, that's enough.
I can't believe you guys didn't ask me to be the godfather.
It might have hurt your chances that you're kind of a pothead.
What are you talking?
When I look at you through this fork, you look like you're in jail.
No, dude... you're in jail.
Well, that's not the image I want to project.
Okay, how can I handle this problem?
You could quit smoking pot.
Settle down, okay?
I mean, quit?
I don't think,
Not quit.
Some time off... from my weed.
I already hate this.
I'm here for you, man, okay?
Anyways, you can't have any around, we need to get rid of all the pot in your apartment.
You can't be serious.
You got a great belly laugh.
But then again, you got a great belly.
I haven't heard that compliment since this thing started growing inside of me.
Damn, I gotta go cover the Warriors game.
How about come back here afterwards, we'll polish this off,
Can I ask you a question about my body?
I see this ending well for me.
Yeah, it's possible.
I retract my thank you.
He must be one of those pregnophiles.
Like people who are into weird costumes or feet or... monogamy.
Is that all of it?
That's it.
The thought of all that weed, down there in the sewer, being smoked by all those sewer people...
What the hell are you talking about?
The sewer people.
Are there not sewer people?
Then who defends the treasure?
Ladies, I give you weed-free Davis and his handsome friend, me.
Davis, good for you.
I don't remember you being weed-free since...
Good for you!
So, has Nick called you yet?
I am right about this baby thing, I am having fun.
I'm not wearing a bra.
You know, when I want to reel back in an old lover,
I take sexy photos of myself and post them on Facebook.
It hasn't really worked yet.
But I did discover i'm allergic to rose petals.
It's a great idea to give Nick a little reminder of how desirable you are.
We sent him those pictures of us in Cabo with the super-hot cliff divers.
Give me "hot" and "sexy" and
"don't you want to fertilize my eggs?"
There.
This'll be the push Nick needs.
Now me and my new boots are gonna get hammered.
I found out my boyfriend cheated on me, and I want to get back at him.
Hi, I'm Zack.
Man, you're a really good writer.
Now you're just busting my balls.
I am, but you know, this is a really good article.
Like their asses were replaced by rockets.
You'd be like a big, golden sexy giant to them.
Sully, tell me more about yourself.
You know, do you date?
But what about the last person you went out with?
Was she... anything like me?
In some ways.
I mean, we were really into each other, but then it just ended after, I think... nine months.
That one lasted about eight months, but she dropped early.
Dumb girl, real dumb.
This was so much fun, but I gonna meet my sister at a bar a few blocks away.
Can I walk you there?
No, it's me.
Good-bye.
Screw it!
Yeah, that wasn't ours.
Nick's had all day to call or come and get me.
That sounds expensive.
Well, where can we go that's free?
How about your place?
Did you say let's go back to my place?
Thank you for walking me here.
Well, I wasn't ready to say good-bye to you yet.
You know, i...
Would it weird you out if I kissed you?
I don't usually say this after I've kissed someone, but there's the guy who got me pregnant.
I kind of have to.
Zack, this is Sully.
I'm a big fan of your work.
So, he's a cool guy, huh?
Okay, how come every man in my life knows this word?
Well, I think you are wrong.
I really like him.
My pregnancy has nothing to do with it.
Thanks.
You are plump and juicy.
There's no polite way to ask you this.
Are you, by any chance, a pregnophile?
What the hell is a pregnophile?
Well, it means someone who is attracted to pregnant women.
I'm a nice man with nice desires.
Now if you'll excuse me, i'm gonna write an article on the top 10 most hurtful things people have ever said about me.
I still can't talk about.
I can't believe I'd let you guys get in my head like that.
Isn't it possible that he is a nice man with nice desires?
All right.
And we did...
Till I started making out with that girl.
I'm calling her.
This couch is so dirty, I feel like i'm having an adventure.
You should see the bathroom
It's like being in Bangladesh.
You know, if my sister weren't pregnant, I never would have met you.
Well, if my best friend hadn't had sex with your sister,
I never would have met you.
Well, I'm glad we met each other.
Me, too.
You'd make a baby with me, right, Davis?
What if he didn't, and we call and she's not there?
We don't have an answer for where she is.
You can't put a good spin on, "your wife is missing."
He knows where she is.
Hold on man, I'm coming.
Okay, this is going to sound bad, but it could be worse.
Your sister is at Davis's, he's locked himself in the bathroom 'cause she wants to have sex with him.
Oh, my god!
I have a terrible feeling I made this happen.
I think I made this happen, too.
She is my wife and i'm coming with you.
Okay.
I like angry Nick.
If you're a man, you can probably push me indefinitely.
Maybe they're sleeping.
Or having really quiet, tender sex.
Let's just get in there while Nick is still trying to parallel park.
Oh, god, this is all my fault.
Hello?
Thank god.
Billie, you're in jail.
You guys are stoned?
I am so telling mom about this.
"I am so telling mom abo...
Really, don't tell mom!
But I am kind of in a silly mood.
I was under the distinct impression that you flushed it all.
Poor, innocent Zack.
You never flush it all, dude.
You always keep some, in case there's a war.
I saw a rat that had a cat in its mouth.
Nick, you came to me!
Wait, I'm mad at you.
That outfit looks even better in person.
I Miss you.
I Miss you, too.
I'm sorry I've been so stubborn about the baby thing, but... if you feel like you're ready, then I am, too
We're ready!
I have a wonderful feeling I made this happen.
Unbelievable.
So you made me feel bad for questioning why you liked me, but I think it's clear now that I was right because...
You don't want her to know, you're going out with her 'cause she's pregnant?
I'm sorry, You need to know that you're on a date with a pregnophile.
This is my sister Denise.
And she ain't pregnant.
