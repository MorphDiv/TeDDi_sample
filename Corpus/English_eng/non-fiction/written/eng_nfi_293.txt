I can't end the curse unless I send every single revenant back to hell.
Run!
Doc, quick!
Shit!
You made it awful peevish!
It was plenty peevish and headed for your back when I shot it!
Waverly!
We haven't formally met.
I'm Wynonna.
Wynonna Earp.
You said you were ready for anything.
Juan Carlo was right.
More than just revenants flooding the Ghost River Triangle now.
Simple.
We use it to rescue Dolls.
Your missile strike has been called off.
And my demon?
Dispatched.
Wynonna goddamn Earp.
Yeah, Earp has always been hard to contain.
Speaking of containment, your transfer to Black Rock prison is set for 0600 hours.
Get him out of here.
See, Wynonna's not a flowers and chocolate kind of a girl.
D'you anticipate charging Earp as an accessory after the fact?
We're weighing the evidence, considering our options.
Thanks, Pam.
So no parade down main street in my honour then?
I'd settle for a smoothie and one sad stripper.
Look, the town needed a plausible, non-supernatural explanation for what happened.
I'm a monster who knows what you sacrificed to save this town.
It's that smell.
Oh yeah, they found a dead possum in the vents.
They who?
Right.
Black Badge showed up with the antidote, then they stayed to clean everything out.
They've got all of Dolls' shit?
Well, I kept his mug.
Deputy Marshall Dolls was too smart and too stubborn to keep anything truly important here anyway.
Where did he sleep?
Good question.
I'll grab what I can, meet you back at the Homestead.
Wow.
What the portable travel lab... cross-dressing hell?
Also I am the cops.
Joke's on you, bitch.
Gun only works for me.
Like, you and Dolls'...?
Uh, yeah, he's my...
Weird.
You have amazing taste in underwear.
My poor, brave baby.
We sure do a lot of patching each other up these days.
Yeah, when there are so many other things that we should be doing.
You taste... different.
I am now in the kitchen...
When did you become such a prude, huh?
Didn't you own a brothel?
It was a bordello, and it is called being a gentleman.
Well, I appreciate it, Henry.
You know, I don't think Wynonna's even sat down since...
I'm worried about her.
As am I.
But I was asking more particularly about yourself, Waverly.
Willa was your sister too.
I feel fine.
Wynonna can handle herself.
Hurts like a mother.
Woman, it's just a bruise.
I know.
And your holds are atrocious.
I'll have you know I'm kind of a big deal around here.
I'm the Earp heir.
Destined to fight Wyatt's revenant demons.
End a curse?
I took you out with a lamp.
Black Badge.
Said they're taking him to prison.
Xavier told me that if he was ever gone or didn't check in for 24 hours I should burn his files.
Dark ops, middle of the Baltic Sea, average life expectancy once you get there is like two months.
I'm not giving up on him.
Then you're gonna need me.
They won't transfer him right away.
Any safe house they store him in...
Well, that makes two of us.
But you should prepare yourself.
Not only is there a high chance of us getting dead, but Dolls might already be.
Or worse.
What's worse than dead?
All the files from Dolls' motel room and nothing on where they might have taken him.
The location of Black Badge satellite offices are kept secret, even from one another.
Makes it way harder to track their movements, activities.
If you only knew the stuff they were into...
I do not believe we have met.
Yeah, Okay, this is Eliza, she is a friend of Dolls'.
Dolls has a friend?
Yeah, Okay, so this is my sister Waverly and her...
Okay, so how do we spring Dolls?
Well, Eliza, Doc and I need to find the latest coordinates from the local BBD safe house.
I can use my credentials, but here's the thing:
It's just plastic cattle prods and baseball bats.
Old school.
Means we got a fighting chance.
I'm saying this, but without Bobo keeping them in line, who knows what they're up to.
Okay, when was the last time you slept slash ate slash applied deodorant?
Did Bobo do something to you?
Uh... don't deflect, I hate it when you do that.
Wynonna, listen, 24 hours ago you shot our sister.
Yeah, and it sucked.
Not helping.
I'm sorry.
Listen, I need you to be Okay.
So why am I dragging you into this again?
Because I love you?
Hit me.
This'd be a lot easier if I had a combo.
But I am.
Guys.
You figure Black Badge will provide medication on their end?
Not a chance.
What are you talking about?
He's a good man.
He's also not a man at all.
Old Bread Factory on Cherry Brick Road!
Credentials?
What exactly are you transporting here?
The last of the shit from Purgatory.
Please exit the vehicle.
We've had a rough day, Ma'am.
You know the drill.
We don't get to clean-up, that smell's likely to linger round here for weeks.
My.
There's lots more where that came from, Tex.
I'm from Georgia, Ma'am.
Your head looks naked.
Why are you sneaking around if you have a security pass?
I had to get up there to cut the wire that disables the alarm.
Better nut up and decide who you can trust.
Dolls provided you guys with guns I've never even heard of.
We're not taking any guns.
Okay.
Hey, you gonna be Okay with this?
You and I working side by side for Black Badge?
Hmm... having to stare at your gorgeous smile and pretty French braid around the conference table...
Actually, I'm thinking of cutting it.
Think I'll manage.
And desperate things make desperate decisions.
This, Nicole, is for the greater good.
What?
Okay, if you want me to trust you, you've gotta tell me the plan.
Preferably before I find you holding an axe over my head.
Wynonna made me promise not to.
She's my sister, Nicole.
I have to protect her now more than ever.
Hey... just like I need to protect you.
I just...
I just wanna make sure you're Okay, you know, that... that deep down, you're still... my Waverly.
You backstabbing charlatan.
I'll call in Plan B. What's plan B?
Walking through the front door, right about... now.
One ore daemonium?
Jolly big mouth demon?
Ah, of course.
The shoes, don't forget the shoes.
Thing is, there's no visit from Scotland Yard scheduled in the log.
It'd be one remarkably elaborate con, right, chap?
Left, right, right again.
Waverly, that is the worst British accent I've ever heard.
Keep that getaway car running,
Agent Haught.
You don't gotta stay there and watch me.
In a couple hours you're going to Black Rock.
And I'd like to be the last person you see before they blindfold you.
Well, well, Agent Shapiro.
Eliza?
I couldn't save them both.
Greg told me to leave him.
He knew he was bleeding out.
He liked you.
Wynonna?
Doc?
You stay put, Okay?
Lucado!
Lucado!
Hellooo?
Whoa.
Oh, you guys already have one.
A big one.
Plan B here, good for eliminating all unwanted problems quickly.
And yes, I'm on my way to the getaway car, far, far away from the danger.
No, no, not that, nyet.
Plan B, AKA you, needs to become Plan C.
Tell me what you need.
You shared a hotel room, you were obviously very close.
What?
I just like to see you squirm.
He's what Black Badge made him.
Though they lied to him about that, too.
What they did to us.
There is a possibility I am now hallucinating.
I'm prepared for that.
And I'll take care of it.
Though I was kind of hoping
I could go 24 hours without killing someone I...
Pray tell, what exactly is Waverly doing?
So, in London, we have a R-500...
Uh, do you mean the S-550?
He's an American rapper.
I'm British, not elderly.
No, listen, our system gives us trouble when it comes to opening security doors...?
You mean like... this?
Can you open all of them simultaneously?
Not that you'd ever want to...
What the hell?
Because it'll smell it.
No, no, no!
Why did you hit me?
Okay, my name is Waverly, Waverly Earp...
I'm here with my sister and Doc Holliday.
And some super fit secret agent, all to rescue... all to rescue Dolls.
Agent Xavier Dolls?
Yes, Okay.
Here they come.
You must be yanking my va-Jane.
These alarms are not good news for Waverly.
Well, hit it again!
And if he is no longer the raging asshole we know and respect,
I shall take care of it.
It's my turn, Wynonna.
You've had enough.
Was this your plan all along?
Now go, save the sister you've got left.
Okay, if we don't get some real help, we're gonna get super eaten.
Bring it!
I thought you were good in your underwear.
You should see what I can do naked.
Aw, hell.
Well, do you mind if I smoke?
Feels good to break the rules every now and then, huh?
Indeed.
I was there when they built the railroad.
If that stuff's as old as it looks, it's...
You're insane.
How do you like my moustache now?
Don't mind if I do.
Now, say you're sorry.
I'm sorry.
Not to me.
Don't kill her, Dolls!
If you do, this will all be over.
I don't think I can make it, though.
Well, you'd better, or I'll have two angry Earp sisters breathing down my throat.
Where d'you get all this dynamite from?
What happened to your hat?
Oh, God.
Hey, hey, hey!
No.
Whoa, Okay, what... what did you do?
Not today, Satan.
Are you sure you're not Scotland Yard?
Hey.
You kept one.
Okay.
Don't need it.
Can you please tell her?
I will.
Dolls, go!
I do feel naked without it.
I told them if they didn't help me, I...
I don't even know this guy!
Stand down, Agent Lucado.
Yes.
Doesn't make a lick of difference in the end.
Well, Xavier used his one freebie to save your little town from a nuclear mishap.
You were going to bomb Purgatory?
Seems you need to be reminded about your use of contraband weapons in general,
Agent Lucado.
Now yours.
You can pry Peacemaker from my cold dead hands.
I think I'll have one of the boys here do that for me.
So you brought your magic gun just in case there was a demon attack, hm?
I brought my magic gun to remind you all that I'm the goddamn Earp heir and the only one who can send Wyatt's revenants back to hell.
I think revenants are the least of your problems.
Or haven't you seen any of the new beasts that have flooded Purgatory?
But yes, you will continue to patrol the Ghost
This is treason.
Someone will.
I can't kill the heir, but the rest of you are expendable.
Got it?
Agent Lucado, the contracts, please.
Hey.
You want us to sign in blood?
Who are you people?
Really?
Does it matter?
Cheer up, Wynonna.
I'll sweeten the pot for you.
You play ball, I'll help you break the Earp Curse.
I already know how to break it.
Bobo Del Rey has been dispatched and his revenants are all scattered.
You'll never find and kill them all, not in your lifetime.
Lift your family's burden for good.
Now get them out of my house.
I swear on our mother's grave.
Seriously, how stupid do you think we are?
He just... shot her.
God, I hope Nicole got out.
Doc...
I'm sorry you had to re-up.
I know how much you hate being one of the good guys.
I highly doubt those were the good guys.
I finally got some dynamite and didn't even get to use it.
So...
I'm not great at thank yous.
You're still pretty great, though.
I'm not sure he deserved it.
Well, we so rarely get what we deserve.
You could come in.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Well, then I'll leave you to it.
I'm sorry I left.
I didn't have a choice, right?
He would've killed you.
In your own blood?
I better get back to the station.
I've still got so much paperwork to do.
So, what do we do now?
Find everything that got into the Ghost River Triangle and kill it.
So, the usual.
Sounds fun.
They should be scared of me.
Forget Black Badge.
Demons.
It's always demons.
You know you don't have to do this all alone.
That's just it.
No matter what they say, I only really have one job now.
Keeping my baby sister safe.
C'mon, Earp.
Let's go break a curse.
