MAN (over loudspeaker):

Vessel Golden Girl, prepare to be boarded.
That's the first time I've ever had the cops called to a party on the ocean.
I-I can't imagine it's a noise complaint.
Well, we're not the cops, we're the Coast Guard.
You want to tell me what's going on here?
Oh.

We've just spent the last ten days cruising South America.
I'm getting married.
Are you aware that this vessel's been sitting dead in the water for an hour?
No Mayday call.
No response when we hailed you.
Uh, sorry.

This area of the Gulf is a known smuggling route.
It's a bad locale for fun.
I'm-I'm sure that the captain can explain.
Where is he?
We're gonna need to search the boat.
(muffled clank)
U.S. Coast Guard.

This man is sick.

Hands!

(gunshots)
What the hell is going on here?

FEMALE OFFICER:

Special Agent Swanson.
Heard you had a morning.
Just another day in paradise, Dwayne.
Who's the new guy?

Forensic tech.

Heading over to Georgia for FLETC soon-- thought we'd give him some field experience.
Looking a little green there.
I just...

You know that we're docked, right?
I do.
Come on.
You got this.

SWANSON:

"Girls gone wild" situation.
Not exactly, Christopher.
Loretta.
You beat us here?
Wanted to be able to tell you things.
Young man is
Daniel Tivoli.
Waiter.

And judging by the cleanness of the cut, it wasn't the killer's first time.
(camera shutter clicking)
Murder weapon was a straight razor.
(clicking)
Oh, wow, that's not just any razor, either.
Hollow ground, 16-millimeter blade, rounded French point, three-pin handle.

The other victim is the captain.
Jorge Valdo.
Triple tap to the chest.

Remind me not to piss you off.
PRIDE:

But I'm wondering why you brought us here.
The yacht belongs to Elegance Charters, a company owned by one Javier Garcia.
Ciudad Natal Cartel's top man in New Orleans.
Launders their money.

Garcia's public enemy number one.
You can connect him to the murder?
Not directly, but maybe to its motive.
SWANSON:

Some kind of a cache.
Yeah, it's common for drug smugglers.
This one could hold dozens of keys.
Yeah, but it's empty.
After the waiter was killed,
I'm guessing someone took the cargo and the yacht skiff, left before my team arrived.
Probably headed to the coast.
The captain had two mates.
One's in our custody, the other's missing.
Connect the drugs directly to Javier's charter company, it's a big win.
Christopher, wrap up here.
Swanson and I'll go above deck and start the interviews.
Question the guests.
I'll talk to the suspect, see if he can... shed any light on where this skiff went.
WOMAN:

Oh, thank God.
Eliza, what...

I am so glad to see a familiar face.
No one will say what's going on.
It's okay.

Eliza West.

I didn't realize that you two knew each other.
Yeah.

(exhales) Are you a guest here?
Yeah, this is supposed to be my party.
I'm getting married.
You'll be receiving an invitation.
That-that... that's wonderful.
Listen, I need to ask you, do you know who owns this yacht?
Of course.
My fiancé, Javier.
Javier Garcia's your fiancé?
Congratulations.
Listen, you... take a seat, okay?
And, um, I'll do everything I can to get you guys out of here as soon as we can.
Thank you.

We're fine.
West as in West Family Mission?
Her father was murdered in a carjacking when she was a teen.
I worked the case for JPSO.
Caught the killer.

She is engaged to the number one target in the cartel investigation.
This case just got a whole lot more complicated.
You want to transfer permanently to NOLA?
Is this some kind of joke?
No joke, sir.

I'd like to take it.
I'm-I'm-I'm drowning in worthless Intel on Javier Garcia.
I cannot connect him to laundering money for the cartels.

I got two dozen agents working day and night to try to find a chink in his armor.
Timing could be better, but you've been in D.C.
Dealing with the case of my career-- and it's supposed to be yours, too.
Look, I'm not asking for an immediate transfer.
I'm going to see this case through.
Tammy, I've invested in you.
For a bright future.

(phone rings) Sir...
ISLER:

You have Isler and Gregorio.

PRIDE:

You can prove that?
Interrogated a very talkative suspect who confirmed that he and his partners were moving contraband.
Who are these partners?
Well, one is-- was... a Cartel foot soldier, killed by the Coast Guard.
The other's a man named Ernesto Blanco.
"Ernesto Blanco."
He's a Natal lieutenant.
Middleman.

You have Blanco in custody?
No, he took off with the yacht's skip, along with the contraband.
But our suspect in custody gave us Blanco's destination.

All right, have him come and get me.
I'll put a team together.
I want Blanco and those drugs in custody.

Oh, this is huge, Pride.
Javier Garcia's never allowed himself to be connected to narcotics.
Is there anyone else of interest on that yacht?
No.
No one important.
GREGORIO:

We got agents ready to move on our say-so.
Coast Guard's got the waterways blocked too.
We got this guy.
(vehicle approaching)
Oh, who's this now?

Either one could have vital information on Javier.
LASALLE:

Oh, looks like the mother lode, too.
Probably millions.
Ooh, that changes everything, Lasalle.
LASALLE:

I know, but this money's being laundered.
This isn't just a drug deal.

You want to pitch it to Isler first?
Would Pride pitch it to Isler first?
That's a big fat no.

All agents stand down.
This is no longer a bust, it's a surveillance operation.
Let's follow the money.
ISLER (over comms):

Sir, I got a visual on Ernesto Blanco and an unknown associate in a white panel van, travelling southwest on River Road.
No, I mean, what exactly are you doing?
You were supposed to arrest suspects and seize contraband.
Yeah, we're following millions in cartel cash.
Probably on its way to getting laundered.
We got a chance to see how the sausage gets made, Isler.
Take down Javier red-handed.

Or you could blow this whole case.
Now, I'm calling this little adventure off.
Take them into custody.
Sir, listen...

Isler?
A minute?
We'll call you back.
(phone set on receiver)
You said you'd connect Ciudad Natal smugglers to Javier Garcia's yacht.
I expect to see suspects in cuffs and drugs on the table.
But it's not drugs.

Pride...

Buying businesses.
Getting a foothold for the cartel.
We can find out how.
Gregorio should've asked.
She called an audible.
I would've done the same.
Yeah, and that's what worries me.
D.C.'s expecting a win.
Let's aim high.
Javier in an orange jumpsuit.
The cartel's operation disabled.
Why is Javier Garcia's fiancée here?
You know about Eliza West?
Her name pops up all over Garcia's personal life.
Why is she here?
She was on Javier's yacht.
But she doesn't know anything.
And you were gonna tell this to me when?
That woman lives with our target, she knows something.
That woman is a close friend.
I'm asking, as a courtesy, let me handle Eliza for now.
We're on a thin ice here, Pride.
Our only advantage over Javier is he doesn't that know we're on to him.
The Coast Guards have his yacht, you have his fiancée, our agents are following his money.
He's not stupid.
He'll figure us out soon.
So we play it tight.
We have Javier come in for questioning.
We hold him long as we can.
Give Gregorio and Lasalle time to track the cash, see where it goes.
And then arrest Garcia.

(sighs)
Oh, Dwayne.
I'd like to call my fiancé.
We already have.

Can we ask you some questions?
(short laugh) Well, what can I say?
This was supposed to be a celebration.
Me and my friends cutting loose on a cruise.
What made you choose South America?
It was Javier's idea.

I was doing charity work in Colombia for a long time.
Building schools.

What does Javier's work have to do with a waiter being murdered on his boat?

And you think it has something to do with Javier?
Actually...

He's a good man.
You'll like him.

Want a cup of tea?
Yeah.
Be right back.
Okay.
She has no idea that Javier is cartel.
She wouldn't be engaged to him if she did.
And is there a reason why we're not telling her?
Javier's dangerous.
He's using her... for a reason.
I need to find out why.
The less she knows, the safer she is.
For now, at least.
Oh, I got him.
GREGORIO:

LASALLE:

They ship cargo all over the Southeast.
Probably switching vehicles.
Hey, Patton, you with us?
PATTON (on comms):

Just got the photos.
Including a beauty shot of your unknown suspect.
My capable associate is all over it.
Running the photos through BRUCE for facial recognition now.
Swanson, you still with us?
Cartel tried to take a bite out of me.
Gonna bite back.
GREGORIO:

We're losing visual.
PATTON:

Do any of those words mean you can give us access to what's inside?
Give me a minute, I'll be your eyes in the sky.
No, I don't like flying blind.

Well, Patton's all over it, all right?

Special Agent Pride.
Mr. Garcia.
You know each other?
Special Agent Pride was instrumental in handling some unfortunate business at my son's school a couple of weeks ago.
How is your son?
Better.
You know why you're here?
A man was murdered on my yacht.
By your crew.
Any idea why?
The Golden Girl was your charter.
The crew were your employees.
Yes, it's true.
But I don't see to day-to-day operations.
That's what you said a couple weeks ago when your construction company was responsible for dumping toxic soil.
The crew... on your yacht may have been involved in smuggling.
You don't seem to have much luck when it comes to hiring people.
I was warned New Orleans is a dangerous city.
(Isler scoffs) No, it's proven to be true.
But my work and my fiancée are here.
May I see Eliza now?
Not just yet.
SWANSON:

Emile Rojas.

Sending his résumé your way.
Interpol's been monitoring this guy for years.
Well, he's connected to all kind of murders in South America.
Shootings, stabbings, bombings.
Victims are witnesses, politicians, drug dealers.
All with one connection in common.
Ciudad Natal.
TAMMY:

Either Blanco hired him to take out a target...
Or Blanco is a target.

I got 'em.

All right, what are they doing?
Talking.

Blanco looks scared.
Oh, damn!
SWANSON:

Let's go!
Dead.
Patton, where's Rojas?
He's taking the riverside exit.
Cash must be still in the van.
We lost him.
Everything all right?
Never better.
But I'm afraid an urgent business matter has just come up that... requires my full attention.
I'm going to collect Eliza now.
We're not done asking you questions about the crew of your yacht.
But I have nothing left to say.
So unless I'm being detained for some reason,
I assume I'm free to go.
Of course.
Do you think he knows how cornered he is right now?
Honestly...
I can't tell.
We got a situation.

Damn it.
♪ ♪
Start of the day, we had cartel lieutenant Ernesto Blanco, millions in drug money and a foothold in the Javier Garcia investigation.
Now Blanco's dead, the cash is gone and Javier's walking free.
Emile Rojas is a cartel hit man.
He killed Blanco, took the cash, probably on Javier's orders after the Coast Guard seized his yacht.
And where's Rojas now?
In the wind.
Which leaves us where?
I'll tell you where:

Rojas is the key here.
Track him down, scoop him and the money up.
It's what we do, sir.

Or we did, until you came south.
Look, I know I messed up.

No, I...

I let you two take initiative.
It won't happen again.
You're sitting this out, Gregorio.
What?
It's as much my case as it is yours.
Not anymore.

Sir, I...

Don't even start.
Gregorio's a good agent.

The FBI, NCIS and the Coast Guard are working the case.
That's plenty of manpower.
Well, you're the boss.
What is that supposed to mean?
Just acknowledging your leadership.
Well, you never have before.
Got to work together here.
Okay.
Let's go find that missing cash.
First Street Wharf ships cargo all over the Southeast.
Dozens of trucks come and go by the hour, moving tons of freight.
We cross-referenced manifests with deliveries to or from Javier Garcia's businesses.
Assuming you haven't found a connection, or we'd be on our way.
No.

It's just not to Javier.
SWANSON:

The truck from the depot headed there this afternoon.
Well, if the ranch isn't connected to Javier, then who's it connected to?
PRIDE:

Eliza West.
I'm pulling a warrant.
Eliza is not involved in cartel business.
Then she'll have nothing to hide.
Dwayne, what is going on?
It's just a routine search.
(scoffing):

Do you know this man?
Yes.
He was a mate on Javier's yacht.
Is he in trouble?
He's dead.
We think the man who killed him came here with some evidence we're searching for.
What kind of evidence?
Millions of dollars in cash.
(laughing)
We raise horses here and train them, we're not hiding any money.
Don't think it's your money.

Javier keeps his money in the bank just like everyone else.
So are you going to tell her or am I?
Have you heard of the Ciudad Natal?
Colombian drug cartel.
In the newspaper.
Javier Garcia's one of their leaders.
(laughing):

It's true, Eliza.
Javier is an investor.
He owns some motels, a construction company.
That's all.
I know this is a lot to take in.
He partnered with my family foundation to give back to the community.
He is not a drug dealer.
(whistles)
We got something here.
Maybe around $3 million.
Lasalle and Gregorio saw a lot more.
That's enough.
I have no idea where that came from.
From drug trafficking, Ms. West.
That's, uh, blood money.
It-- this can't be true.
Well, we'll figure it out back at my office.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, am I being arrested?
No one's under arrest.
Not yet, at least.
Ms. West, do you have a jacket?
One of my agents will get it for you.
(panting):

Just wait.
Isler...
Hey, this isn't up for debate.
She's coming in now.
Now, we tried it your way this morning and it blew up in our faces.
She's a person of interest.
Eliza's not stupid.
Push her, she'll call the family lawyer.
Then what do you suggest?
I've known the girl 20 years.

Let me speak to her.
We'll find out everything she knows.
(scoffs)
Come on.

This is a bad man.
Drug dealer, killer.
God knows what else.
Whew.

If it wasn't for me, he'd still be alive.
In custody, possibly informing on Javier Garcia.
You feel responsible?
I am responsible.
I acted impulsively, someone died.
Okay.
Then do something about it.

Is that the kind of tough love you give Pride?
All the time.
All right, so I got something.
Hope it's good.
There were traces of a white residue on the garrote used to kill Blanco.
I figured it could give us a clue as to where our killer's been or where he's going.
See, this is Chinese drywall.
It's part of a huge batch of shoddy building supplies that were used after Katrina.
I remember.
Builders all over the city were involved.
I thought most of the drywall was disposed of.
There's at least one building project in New Orleans that still stands.

How do you know?
My ex-husband was the developer.
When the scandal hit, he skipped town, building was condemned, and no one had the money to tear it down.

Man, New Orleans' own mini Chernobyl.
An excellent hideout for a fugitive.
I'll call Lasalle and check it out.
Come on, Sebastian.

Time for some more field work.
Oh.
(whirring)
The cartel is building a foundation.
Legitimate companies give them the ability to wield influence.
Your family is one of the most respected in New Orleans.
If he marries you, it gives him access to politicians, to decision makers.
A cynical way of looking at life.
(sighs)
You were so young... when your father was killed.
I made a promise to you back then.

You promised to find the men responsible.
And you did.
Also said that you would always look out for me.
Exactly.
That's why I'm gonna show you these.
Victims of the Ciudad Natal.
Cost of doing business.
That's who Javier really is.
He wants to do to New Orleans what he's already done to Bogota.
(scoffs)
Help me, Eliza.
Help me take down this man and protect our city.
Your father's legacy.
What do I have to do?
According to Eliza, Javier's secretive about work.
Handles all the banking and books himself.
Spends his days dealing with business, and his evenings with Eliza and his son.
Sometimes attending charity events around the city.
Please say that's not all you have.
Javier's an embed.
He was sent to blend in.
He's not burying bodies in his yard.
He's careful.
Eliza was there when Ernesto Blanco murdered an innocent man on Javier's yacht.
She had three million in cartel cash at her stables.
He's not that careful.

You said you could talk to her and get her to cooperate.
I need more.
Javier has an office in the house.
A computer with a dedicated server where he handles all his business.
If there's a smoking gun, it's on that server.
Can we hack it?

It's Fort Knox.

If we want access, it has to be someone on the inside.
Not someone.

She lives with Javier, and he trusts her.
He's using her for her name and connections.
He discovers she's cooperating with us, what'll he do?
You have a better option?
Emile Rojas.
The cartel sicario sent in to clean up the mess on the yacht.
He killed Ernesto Blanco and took off with the rest of the smuggled cash.
We get him and the money, we can leverage him to give up Javier.
It's possible we can take down the cartel without putting Eliza at risk.
What's with you and this girl?
Made a promise to her years ago to keep her safe, and I intend to honor it.
Any idea where Rojas is?
Lasalle's running down a lead.
Okay.
But if you can't locate him soon, Eliza's on deck.
LASALLE:

If Rojas was here, he's gone by now.
Well, let's go in and check it out.
Oh, good idea.

Flashlight... in case you need to see.
You smell that?

Like someone recently lit a fire.
I got something here.
Guess he's been staying here.
Bathing here, too.
Oh, my...
Guess we found our missing cash.
I'll let Chris know.
(Rojas grunting)
(both grunting)
(grunts)
(groaning)
Drop the... drop the knife!
(yelling):

Shoot him already!

(three gunshots)
(Gregorio wheezing and panting)
(panting)
(panting) You all right?
Fine.
(Gregorio sighs heavily)
It's over.
Lower the weapon, baby.
(sighs)
(panting)
(continues panting)
ISLER:

Gregorio got some bumps and bruises.
Wondering what she was doing there in the first place.

She wanted to see the case through.
So, our one suspect is dead, the rest of the cartel cash is in ashes.
We need Eliza to access Javier's computer.
Javier brought a trained assassin to clean house and destroy millions in drug money.
Probably 'cause he knows we're on to him.
What do you think he'll do to her if he finds out she's cooperating?
And how many others die if we let him go, Pride?
I won't put Eliza in danger.
It's not your choice.
(sighs)
Ever since my father was killed, my family and I have tried to help people, to do the right thing.
You know what we're asking?
You want me to copy his hard drive.
Just show me how.
We'll walk you through every step.
Well, we better hurry.

Dwayne.
I won't let anybody else get hurt.
I can handle this.
(doorbell rings)
Special Agent Pride.
Please come in.
Hope it's all right that I drop by.
I...
I wanted to apologize.
For what?
How you were treated yesterday.
FBI's not much on courtesy.
It's not how I would have handled things.
Especially since you're engaged to Eliza.
(laughs) Dwayne.
I was surprised to find out you knew each other, but
New Orleans is such a small city.
It's the biggest small town in America.
Oh, it's one of my personal favorites for you.
We must try it.
Uh, sounds good to me.
I'll find some proper whiskey glasses.
Excuse me.
(sighs) PRIDE:

This is a beautiful home.
Arts and Crafts.
Right off the avenue.
Very New Orleans.
JAVIER:

I wanted to make her feel comfortable.
(sighs)
Okay, I'm in.
What do I do?
Okay, take a deep breath, strap in and let's boot that puppy up.
Okay.
(gasps)
It's asking for a password.
Insert the thumb drive.
My packet sniffer will access the security protocol, and I'll talk you through the rest.
(panting)
Okay.

Listen.
There's still multiple fail-safes here.
One wrong command, and it'll send a message straight to Javier's phone.
W-Wait.

Don't worry about that.
Just listen to me.
I'm gonna tell you what to type.
All right?

CDW CS2, forward slash.
Now hit "enter."
(sighs)
You know, you got a beautiful yacht, too.
I...

Is that possible?
I mean, know it's...

Well...

I'd appreciate it.
Mm.
I'm sorry to-to keep you waiting.
I'm...

Okay.
(sighing):

JAVIER:

(gasping)
(whispering):

Eliza?

Okay, she can remove the drive now, we'll get most of the files.

Eliza?
Uh... (computer beeps)
Got it.
PATTON:

ELIZA:

I wanted to find the crystal.
Oh... good idea.
But only two glasses?
Oh, uh, I can't stay.
I'm already late for a-- a board meeting for the family trust.
Tonight?
(sighs)
I mean, even after everything you've been through?
(Eliza sighs) Duty calls.
(chuckling):

Of course.
Maybe I should come with you.
Oh, no, no.
That's very sweet.
I'll be okay.
Shall we?
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink.

(phone chimes) (drink pouring)
Everything all right?
Never better.
Sebastian?
You all right?
Yeah.

There's not a thing wrong with me.
Why do you look like someone just died?
Because Tammy almost did.
It's my fault.
It's Emile Rojas's fault.
All right?

Tammy's back at FBI.
But she was in trouble.
All right, and I-- I could've helped her, but I froze up, I was a-afraid of missing the shot.
Which is why you didn't take it.
I'm not ready to be a field agent.
Of course not.
That's what training is for.
Don't ever give up.
All right, but keep doing what you do best, because right now, we need you.
Well, I'm gonna process all the evidence we got from Rojas's hideout, try to find some connection to Garcia.
Adios.
All right, see you, buddy.
(elevator dings)
You all right?
(sighing)
Surprised Isler let you back in the building after disobeying his orders.
Getting Javier's files put him in a forgiving vein.
Hmm.

With the forensic accountants, sorting through the files.
We're hitting Javier tonight, before he realizes that we got access to his computer.
Take out his whole operation.
You should come.
Yeah, well, I...
I'll leave it to pros.
Hey.
What you did tonight helped a lot of people.
(chuckles)
Thank you.
You stopped me from making a horrible mistake.
Saved my family's name.
Looked out for me, the way you always have.
Gonna be hard for a while.
FBI will take you to a safe house until Javier and his organization are dismantled.
I'll get you home as soon as I can.
(softly):

Thank you.
Yeah.
Well, I guess this is my ride.
Yeah.

You're gonna be okay.
Yeah.
All right.

We got an issue.
Something wrong with Javier's files?
Oh, they're in perfect order.
Hundreds of pages of data on Javier's business.
A dozen companies, $50 million in assets, enough to bury whoever's in charge.
Then what's wrong?
None of it connects to Javier.
What?

Every company, every account has Eliza's name on it.
Or one of her relatives.
Well, how is that possible?
The stables.
Javier made Eliza the sole proprietor.
Every one of his businesses leads back to it, or another of the West family holdings.
Perfect setup to cover himself.
We can take down the businesses, but we can't link him to any wrongdoing.
Javier's free and clear.
(phone ringing)
Sebastian, I can't talk right now.
Then I'll do the talking.
I-I analyzed the evidence that we got from Rojas's hideout for DNA and fingerprints-- that place was a petri dish of biologicals.
Rojas is dead.
We already know he was a hit man for the cartel, so...
Right, but he wasn't the only one.
I found DNA of a second sicario all over that hideout.
A-A Marcos Velasco.
And according to deleted texts that I got off of Rojas's phone, his target is Eliza West.
Pride, are you there?
(phone ringing)
(phone ringing)
Dwayne?
Have them turn the SUV around right now!
You're not safe!

(Eliza screams)
PRIDE:

(SUV horn blaring)
PRIDE:

Eliza... it's... it's-- it's-- it's okay.
(sirens approaching)
Oh, no.
Oh...
ISLER:

Along with three agents.
Our entire case against Javier Garcia has fallen apart.
Gregorio?
Do you hear me?
Sir, we can still dismantle his laundering operation.
Not "we," Gregorio.
If D.C. can't have Javier's head on a pike, they want one of ours.
I did what I thought was best.
And I stand by the calls I made.
Then you stand alone.
You went rogue.
Disobeyed my orders.

(sighing) It's unacceptable.
Your career... is over.
(playing blues)
It's a little early in the day, King.
I was with the West family last night.
Trying to explain what happened to Eliza.
Well, it's not your fault.
But it is, Christopher.
