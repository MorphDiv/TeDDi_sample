Is Shredder's heart really in that thing?
Where would you even get something like that?
Don't ask questions you don't want answers to, Vic.
Yeesh.

Hey, yo, Boss.
You want me to take that gross thing off the table for you?
We got some nice lamb chops.

You ignorant goombahs.
Some cultures believe that you gain the power of your enemy by consuming the heart.
It's where the soul resides.
You got me?

First, I took this good luck charm from the Shredder.
Next, I take his turf.
With that freak gone, the entire city belongs to Don Vizioso.
[laughs]
Hmm.
Hey, bring me another calzone!
Step on it.

[belches] Mm.
Any mutant, freak, or weirdo who gets in my way gets eliminated.
Especially mutant turtles.

Faithful followers, for Kavaxas to resurrect the great Shredder, we must obtain one final item:
the Shredder's heart!
Weird.
I didn't think Shredder even had a heart.
Shh!
I have already sent Zeck and Steranko to find the heart.
If they fail me,
I will have both of their souls.
You mean, if they fail me, Kavaxas.

Okay, team, now we know what they're looking for.
It's, um, gross and weird, but we have to stop them.

Nice save, April.
Bacon breath is gonna pay for that.
Comrade Claw, it is the Rocksteady.
I speak with underworld contacts and find Shredder's heart.
Is with that filth, the chubby monkey, Don Vizioso.
Zeck, get over there and make sure you succeed.
Don Vizioso's place?
It makes perfect sense that a psychotic creep like Vizioso would want it.
[distant snorting]
I'm here, Rock.

[electronic beeping]
I see the heart, yo.
Dang!
I bet that fool is nasty enough to try to eat it.
Blech!
Retrieve the heart at all costs!
Do not disappoint... us.
No worries.
Be like taking candy from a big ugly baby.
[electronic beeps] [snorts]
And should this candy thieving fail,
I am the plan B. [laughs]
That sounded cool, da?
This is the last step to resurrecting Shredder.
Let's go.

We're Ninjas.
There has to be a stealthier way.
There's no time, Leo, and I wanna give Don Vizioso a little payback from when he tried to slice and dice me.

At least Tiger Claw and Hot Head don't have it yet.
Accent on the "yet" part.
No!

I'm impressed.
I kinda like you ticked off, Donnie.
[sighs] Being ticked off isn't gonna help anything.
It's your fault we blew it, Donnie.
My fault?
[both growling]
Vizioso is a minor inconvenience compared to Kavaxas.
How do we stop that monster?
Tiger Claw has this...

It's some kind of ancient magic.
If we can get it away from him...
Maybe we can control Hot Head!
Then he can make us pizza, play video games with me, even clean my room!
[Chompy yelps] [grunts]
All right, first thing's first.

Go figure...
I'll never give it up now.
I'll just lay low for all this mutant nonsense to blow over.
If Tiger Claw shows up with Kavaxas, do whatever you can to get that Seal.
And where will you be?
I'm going in alone, full-stealth to get the heart from the Don.
Are you kidding me, Leo?
The Solo-Leo act is getting a little stale, bro.
Ninja stealth is the only option.
Whelp, Donnie is in total agreement with you, dude.
What?
He's going in solo, bro.
Full-Ninja-Stealth.
Whoa!

Donatello, what are you doing?
I'm getting that heart and putting an end to Vizioso for good!
