Previously on x company...

We will execute these prisoners.
One by one until you step forward.
We have friends.

Your son klaus.

To a canadian pow camp.
Be kind to him.

I meant what I said before, son.
So did i.

Aurora, his feelings for you make you all vulnerable.
End it.

About the spies who pretend to be my friends?

We did get the recording.

Is working with the allies, but she's keeping the secret.
Let's hope we don't need to use it.
They're projecting a surge in oil production in march?
It's part of a highly classified project.
Operation marigold.

Thank you.

Let's get to work then.
The days ahead won't be easy,
But our unified resistance network will.
Become a symbol of strength!
Together we can get a message out,
Rally all frenchmen to ensure the next allied invasion.
Is a success.

If we hit the bastards now, others will follow!
That's suicide!

There's no future for him unless we mount an attack right now!
Leave my boy out of this!

To get this man here.

Listen to what he has to say.

Do you know what happened at dieppe?
The russians bring real men,
Real weapons.

Thousands of men cut down on french soil.

Stalingrad is a long ways away.
You want to wait for the reds, you might be waiting a while.
Alex, the allies lost at dieppe because none of us.
Told them about the guns in the cliffs,
The stones that would stick their tanks to the beach.
There are different ways to fight.
Tell them what's coming.

The transfer of power to the nazis.
All of france is going to be occupied.
Has this been confirmed?

It tonight on the radio.

We'll be crushed.
Unless we can look past our differences,
Our philosophies.

So we fight with words?

To unite us.
We build networks,
Fill them with eyes.
We see where the germans are strong, where they're weak.
Allied and resistance networks,
A free flow of information.
So we know where to land our blows.
And when to pick up our guns and fight.
You understand my fellow comrades won't be.
Easily convinced.

You didn't run when they did at the battle of france.
Remind them of that.

We need you.
I need you.
All right, jacques.
Now, gentlemen and mademoiselle.
Let's talk about how we're going to do this.
Just don't leave your coat on the plane.
Don't worry.

Nazis running out of oil.

The course of the war.

We can't let that happen.

Plans for another landing in france?
It's a ways off, but...
Right.

You do remember I am torture-proof.
I'm gonna need to stay in contact.
With faber when I return home.
Our protocol's secure.

We've developed a very...

That requires discretion.
I'm gonna need you to be the middle man.
You want me to pass messages.
Between you and faber?
Off the record.

Aurora's his handler.
Which is why I don't want her to feel undermined.
That faber and I are communicating.
I'm sorry to put you in this position again,
Where you know more than the others but I trust you, alfred.
Of course.
Our printing operations.
Are nearly all shut down.

If you list your specific needs, we may be able.
To drop supplies.

Reception committees in the countryside here, here...
See that man?

He keeps touching his hat.
They're signalling each other.

What is it?

Matthieu!

Go to your hiding place.
Water, biscuits, flashlight, okay?
Go!
They're waiting for us to come out the building.
Yeah, charging the apartment is way more risky.
Than arresting us when we leave.

Is there another way out?

But there is a man watching the alley.
They may have arrested alex.

If these are faber's men, he can call them off.
I have papers, and they're going to be targeting men.
I'll have a better chance of getting by them.
You can't just walk into the gestapo office!
I'll find a way.
Stop!
Your papers.
Yes, of course.
You don't live here.
No.

She's alone and she's very sick.

I was hoping to get the doctor.
We have orders to detain anyone leaving this building.
I'm sorry, mademoiselle, but you'll have to come with me.
One more for the holding area!

I'm sorry.
I haven't...

Go.
I will speak with you after you return with the doctor.
Thank you.
Franz.
Heil hitler!

Give us the room.
Herr obergruppenfuhrer.
I thought you'd left for poland.
I've spoken with sabine about her actions the other night.
You shouldn't be concerned.
You are highly spoken of back home.
Your work here in france has not gone unnoticed.
That's kind of you to say.

How you ensured the enigma's security,
The day of the misadventure at dieppe.
Clever.
I work with some very insightful people.
I'm overseeing a special project in the east.
We're having trouble with the local resistance.
And...
I need a man with exceptional skill to pacify the area.
In the east.

I have an office in pruszko.
Herr obergruppenfuhrer, with all due respect,
This might not be an ideal time for me to step away.
From my responsibilities here in france.
Your transfer has already been approved.
As minister of natural resources, how...?
I pulled strings.
I know it's unorthodox.
But this project is of special importance to me.
As is keeping my family close.
I'm so sorry, sabine, but you have.
To call franz right away.

Come here like this.

In the park across from his office as soon as possible.
I have company.
Yes, an actual friend.

Helene!
I thought that was your voice.

Tell him it's an emergency.
Come in.
Please excuse me for a moment.
I'll be right back.

Fraulein adler.

Please!

Call me heidi.
Is everything all right?

It's my superior at work.
Not only is he being over attentive,
But...

Hiding something.
We're cataloguing for the reich and...
Well, I shouldn't say this,
But some paintings have gone missing.
It's quite stressful.

Get franz to check up on him.
Well, times like this, sabine must be.
A very valuable friend.

I don't want to get into trouble.
The east is untamed territory.
And I need someone with your experience.
I do worry how sabine will feel about moving.
Sabine will benefit by being closer to her father.
There is a level of emotional support.
She seems to be missing at home.
Paris holds too many.
Painful memories.
Think of poland as a new beginning.
Herr brigadefuhrer.
Sorry for interrupting.

I will let you give her the good news.
Help me move the table.
More ss!
Looks like they're working on an entry plan.
I've been saving these for an emergency.
I'd say this qualifies.
I finally went to bed about...

But that's early for me... but I thought I was taking the train.
Back to poland in the morning.
You decided to stay longer?

As a favour to her father.
He asked me to drop in on her, see how she was feeling,
Cheer her up a little.

A difficult time for her.

And the obergruppenfuhrer seems to think.
All she needs is a family to keep her busy.
I see.

Always think they know what's best for a woman.
Sounds like you've met the men I work with.
In poland, things are more progressive.
We are free to make our own rules.
About working, children,
Romance.
If you want something, all you have to do is take it.
Paradise.
He'll do what you want.
Wonderful!

I have to get back to...
Get back to work before my boss notices.
Have a safe trip back to poland.
We should stay in touch.
Conserve your ammo.

It's too bad alex isn't here.
He was itching for a fight.

Walking into my home and using my wife.
Was not the protocol we agreed to.
I know, and I'm sorry but neil and harry are trapped.
By the gestapo at a meeting on rue du four.
You need to call them off.
Excuse me.

Overseen by my staff.

To every action I take.

Harry and neil are trapped there.
What if your staff interrogates them?
What if your name comes up?
There's a black market not far from there.
The back of a pharmacy on saint-germain.
You could redirect your men there.
There are 100 black markets in paris;

I know it's a lot to ask.

This will be the last thing that I do for you.
We have an agreement.
My father-in-law requires my services.
I'm relocating to poland.

As for your friends, I'll see what I can do.
They're on the move.
Wait!
They're pulling back!
Looks like he came through.
Looks like the fun'll have to wait.
It's not a setback,
It's an opportunity.

In poland.

It puts him in a better position to learn.
Where the refineries are.

Zero.

That's why you're going there too.
I'm not sure we can just follow him there.
I mean, he was ready to cut ties.
He doesn't call the shots.

How do we explain french citizens travelling.
Through germany into poland?

At the ministry of transport.

What about france?

Rigaud is going to need time to rally and organize.
Yeah, it'll be even harder when france is fully occupied.
That is time we do not have.

What if...
No.

I was just thinking...

He'd say we're thinking too small.
He'd say what if we could help spread rigaud's message.
And still get ourselves into poland?
Today, hitler's speech will be on national radio.
Compulsory listening.
So what if we could hijack the signal long enough.
For rigaud to talk instead?
It's faster than church meetings, faster than leaflets.
Can you really do that?

Radio ile-de-france transmitter, I'd have to wire up a relay.
We'd also need to get our hands on some broadcast equipment.
It's not impossible.

Get rigaud to write a speech.
Okay.
We don't know anyone.

There's a growing german community.
A lot of women your age.
It could help take your mind off things.
I need to think about it first.
He's already arranged the transfer.
He didn't even ask me as...

Sabine.
Maybe it's for the best.
This city, this apartment,
There are so many painful memories.
Maybe poland can be a new beginning.
And we get away from them.
Herr brigadefuhrer.
I'm sorry for troubling you but I know.
You would want to hear this.

Rigaud?

Agents had staked out the meeting and were prepared.
To raid it when they were relocated...
By your order.
Do you know why those agents were relocated?
No.
Bader arrived at the airfield from berlin this morning?
Yes.

I don't know,
I presumed...
You left him to arrive at an empty airfield.

I don't know.
Hold your report to berlin.

That he's captured.

You were there.
In dieppe.
On the beach?
That's right.
A terrible day.
You lost friends?
I've stopped counting.

How do you keep going?
Knowing that I don't matter.
No matter what happens to me,
The fight will continue.
Like your friend.
I keep thinking of her voice,
How she sang.
So proud.
So free,
Even in the face of death.
I didn't know her name,
But she reminded me.
That the reason we fight,
The reason our friends fought...
Is bigger than all of us.
I'll let you work.
Neil.
Less than three hours to go.

I'll be right there.
Her name was miri.
I got your telegram.
I didn't expect to hear from you until this was all over.
Do you have news?
Is my son all right?
They take good care of him.
But he doesn't like special treatment.
No.

Why are we here, duncan?

I'm sorry to have to meet like this but...
I'm afraid I need your help one more time.
I appreciate your retrieving my son from siberia,
But I hadn't foreseen you taking that as licence to keep coming.
To me for favours.

Yeah.
What is it you want?
So the paris receiver picks up the berlin signal.
And transmits it to everybody within range.
You sure you know what you're doing?
Once we start broadcasting, this repeater I'm splicing in.
Will take over hitler's airwaves.
This station transmitter is so powerful, they will probably.
Hear the message in england!
Jesus!

Wait.
No, it's fine.

Rigaud's voice and not just a bunch of dots and dashes?
That van on the way in?
It's basically a rolling radio station,
So what we have to do is break in, steal the microphone.
And transmitter inside.
Or we just steal the van?
Direction-finding teams.
Will have a much harder time tracking us if we're moving.
Steal a radio station van, drive around the city.
Broadcasting a resistance call to arms with nazis on our tail?
Yeah, I know.
Sinclair's going to hate it, isn't he?
It's bloody brilliant is what it is.
Jacques rigaud.
Come with me.
It's short notice.
But there is a supply train leaving tomorrow.
That goes to poland.

I...
I can ensure that...
One car is empty and won't be checked.
When you get the details, send a telegram.
To the return address.

Ernst, thank you.
Take care.
Duncan.
I need something to tell greta.
She's been worried about klaus.
We've written to him via the royal care society.
But he hasn't written back.

He's treated fairly.

I did, ernst.

How was he?

You remember that summer we taught the boys to play chess?
Yeah.

If you could get him a set,
I'm sure it would help keep his mind off things.
Until this is all over.
Leave it to me.
I know the shame.
He must be feeling as a prisoner.
So, please, duncan,
When you see him,
Let him know that I'm very proud of him.
And that his mother loves him very much.
I admire your courage, duncan.
The war has taken your elder son;
William is still missing.
It seems unfair that...
My son is given all this luxury.
I can't thank you enough for what you have done.
What is it?

It's klaus.
Duncan, what is it you're not telling me?
Ernst, your son...
Died in the line of duty.
What are you saying?
He tried to destroy.
Our communications and assassinate me.
But he was stopped.
Stopped?

You killed him?

It was a suicide mission.
You gave me your word!

He made his own decision.

And you come here asking me for favours?
What kind of man does that?
Where is he?

Where is his body?

There was nothing I could do.
I'm sorry, ernst.
What is all this?
I understand you're relocating to poland.
Obergruppenfuhrer schmidt has asked me to start packing.
For you.

Has been arrested.

How did you secure him so quickly?
Some informants are best kept quiet.
I am honoured to have worked with you.
And I wish you good luck in poland and I hope that your replacement,
Herr oberfuhrer fischer, will treat me as patiently.
We should never have trusted faber!
He came to our home.

Get his wife to call him with a gun to her head.
Neil, that will only burn what we've built.

We need to keep our eyes on the bigger picture.

This safe house is blown.

He left a note, which means he's willing to talk.

Or maybe that's an invitation to an ambush.
He's trying to tie up loose ends before heading to poland.
I don't like it either, but if there's a chance to bargain.
For rigaud, we take it.

To poland?

We need to find another way.
Let's just focus on getting rigaud back, please.
We need rigaud back, unharmed.

Involve my wife.

You fail to mention that the most wanted man.
In france was present at a meeting I protected.
We didn't owe you that information.
You made a commitment not to compromise my credibility.
You failed.

Because your word cannot be trusted.
You called this meeting.

My colleagues in berlin want to interrogate rigaud.
Themselves.

I will allow him to escape.
Good.

Work as a double agent.

Understood.
Thanks.

Until the speech.

I'm sorry about miri.
She's...
She was...

Make sure everything's ready to go.
I'll check we've got enough gas.
If you don't mind my saying,
You don't look well.
You look like I did.
When your soldiers invaded my village.
I swore I would die protecting what I love.
But they took that from me too?
I rotted in a cell for weeks.
Before I worked up the courage.
Then I woke up in a hospital.
Apparently it was a miracle I survived.
The nurse that helped me escape.
Said she wanted to do something good.
This has nothing to do with me.
I should be dead,
So the time I have now...
It's a bonus.
And it's not mine to keep.
I was thinking.
About how you arrested me.
How you knew exactly where I'd be.
How you came alone.
Like you were protecting something.
You're a perceptive man.
I think you also want to do something good.
Stop the truck!
I was right.
You're working with them!

Because I'm not on a plane to berlin.
Go.

Herr brigadefuhrer!
The death of this terrorist.
Will do more to destabilize the resistance.
Than any intelligence he could offer to berlin.
But our orders...

Understand the situation in france.
They are not here on the ground.
I did not rise to my rank by playing by the rules.
This is something you will come to understand.
As you advance your career.
You are a very promising young officer, edsel,
And I would like to continue to see you rise.
For that to happen, our relationship needs.
To be one built on trust.

You will be held responsible for this.
The prisoner fled under your watch.

You will receive full credit for the prevention.
Of his escape, and I will protect you.
From any punishment.

In return,
I will bring you to poland.

To learn from me.

Is that satisfactory?
Yes.
Yes, herr brigadefuhrer.
I think this is actually gonna to work.
What?
What's happened?
Rigaud's body was found.

We don't know what happened.

He was shot trying to escape, neil.

I'm so sorry.
That's that, then?
He was a good man and a great leader.
Now, we still have his plans and his contacts.
The bso will work with the resistance.
Your next move is operation marigold.
Of course, yeah.
Run away?

Rene.

Tom too.

'Cause that's what we do!

And then we're on to the next move.

Jacques rigaud was the point.
Of the radio operation, neil.

I'll update the brits and the americans about marigold.
You need to get to poland.

It's time to play our card.
Rigaud's not the point.
He doesn't matter.

This isn't about him.
It's about the message.
It's about carrying on the fight.

Hitler's speech is about to start.
We can still do this.
Herr brigadefuhrer,
It's almost time.
Right.
Do you mind?
That is, I don't have a radio.
Of course, matthias.
Thank you.
I'll dispatch the radio teams.
If they're broadcasting locally, we'll find them right away.
Go!
I'm speaking to you now.
Because it's time you knew the truth.
France will soon be entirely.
Under german occupation.
Their victory depends entirely on you.
We are closing in.
Wait!

Northeast!
We can be broken and taught to hate.
But together, when we lock arms,
We are a force they cannot imagine.
We are...
We are...
A light that will push back the darkness.
We have 100,000 eyes.
Watching their every move.
100,000 ears listening to their plans.
One for the moon.
They will see that we are unstoppable.
They've stopped.

And you shot him in the back.

With you.

What I had to do in order to protect us both.
And you want me to take that on faith?
Take it how you like.

Are now over.

Your father-in-law is working on a top secret project.
Called operation marigold.

We broke into his briefcase at your party.
We think that operation marigold is a new, bigger oil refinery.
In poland capable of pushing oil production.
Through the roof and guaranteeing a nazi victory.
Franz, I need you to help me find it.
Why would I do that?

About ending the cruelty and the death camps.
I'm offering you a chance to help end this war.
No more secrets.

We stay in contact after I leave.
It's tempting but I can't take that risk.
Good luck to your team.
In the spirit of complete honesty, franz...
Did I tell my father about the spies.
Who pretend to be my friends,
Come to my home and follow me in the streets?
Not yet.
You will help us in poland.
The minute one of my agents fails to report in,
This recording goes public.
There's an update.

We've got a forger who can get papers for the boys,
And faber's back on board.

How would you take it?

When we had him on principle.

Just a guarantee.

His will, how can we trust him?

That he loves his wife more than he hates us.
Aurora, the minute you're on that train,
You become helene bauer full time.
And it is not going to be easy.
Helene and I get along.
You will feel alone.

And say things that you don't want to.
But you've got to keep your eye on the bigger picture.
Marigold.
I've got a plane to catch.

I will.

Get it done.
Good luck.
Well done, you bastard.
Hey, you all right?
Um, yeah.
Just something I should have said before.
That time, that, um...
That kiss.
Yeah?

I... it was a mistake.
Is this sinclair talking?

Alfred,
Look at me.
I am.
Believe me.

I don't feel for you the way I felt for rene.
Here's a bit of good news.
I've found the perfect way to unburden us from some.
Of sinclair's freshly delivered francs.
Hang on.

Really, grandpa?
Like I haven't heard that one before.
How about a toast?

Jacques rigaud, rene,
Tom,
Miri.
To the love they left behind.
Cheers.
Oooh! "Oooh" is right.
Hairs on your chest.

I have a task.
I need you to search the camp rolls for pows in the pacific.
The pacific, herr brigadefuhrer?
I'm searching for a canadian.
William sinclair.
Next week on an
