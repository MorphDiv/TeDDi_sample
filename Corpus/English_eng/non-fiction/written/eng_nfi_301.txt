♪ ♪
[cheers and applause]
- From the Penn  Teller Theater at the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas, here's our host, Alyson Hannigan.
♪ ♪ [cheers and applause]
- Welcome to "Penn  Teller:

where magicians work to deceive, confound, and confuse us.
In other words, they're a lot like politicians.
And now the co-speakers of this house.
One won the popular vote.
The other took the electoral college in a landslide.
Penn and Teller!
[cheers and applause]
♪ ♪
The rules are simple:
Fool Penn and Teller;
perform with Penn and Teller in their world-famous magic show.
With that in mind, check out our first contender.
- My name is Dyno Staats.
I am a mad scientist and steampunk magician.
Steampunk specifically focuses on the Victorian era, when science was still new and it was almost like magic to people.
I've always been interested in the mad scientist character in books and movies.
I approach my magic with the scientific method.
You try the experiment.

You try to figure out why.
You just keep going until you get it right.
It's extremely important for me to create all my props to match me.
Even if it's something real simple that you can buy, I'll remake everything.
If I fool Penn and Teller, it will mean validation for what I'm doing.
Sit back, relax, and come watch, because something might go horribly wrong.
[applause]
- Please welcome the steampunk magic of Dyno Staats.
- Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, people come from all over the world to try and fool Penn and Teller with magic.
The problem:

You have to fool Penn and Teller with something they do believe in:
science!
[thunderclap] [laughter]
So tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to do a science experiment.
Penn, would you happen to have a $1 bill on you
I could use for this experiment?

- I'll come get that from you, if I may.
Excellent.

Now, it may interest you folks to know that everything in science is made up of atoms and molecules that are tightly compacted together, including Penn's bill.
In between the atoms is lots and lots of empty space, tons of it.
There's actually more nothing in this bill than there is bill here, but if you fold it over, you bring the molecules closer together, making it denser.
We can fold it over again and again and bring it closer to singularity, much like a black hole.
Now, unfortunately, I am not a Large Hadron Collider.
I cannot crush this bill down to the size and space of a single atom.
Instead, what we're gonna do is, we're gonna take this bill apart atom by atom, molecule by molecule, bit by bit.
And to do that, we need to use... science!
[thunderclap] [laughter]
I have a pen in my pocket.
I have a Teller in my pocket.
[laughter]
Yeah, here we go.
Gentlemen, would you please join me up on stage?
Penn, I'll have you come here stage right and Teller stage left.
Give them a round of applause as they come on up.
Thank you very much.

Hi, there.

- I'm well, thank you.
Would you please, sir, take that?
And we're going to have you mark your bill right there for me, please.
We're having Penn sign his bill, marking it in case something goes horribly wrong with the experiment, we can recognize it again later, which almost never happens.
Totally safe.

[laughter]
- Okay.
Now, um, we can start the disassembly process on a macro scale by rendering the bill asunder thusly.
We can keep going this way, taking it apart atom by atom.
And atoms are separating at some point here.
Now, unfortunately, I cannot take this apart at an atomic level, atom by atom, molecule by molecule.
We have to use something different for that.
So in the meantime, Penn, would you please be so kind as to hold the pieces of your bill right there so everyone can see them?
Thank you.
I have brought with me, ladies and gentlemen, the Staats Laboratory, a disintegrating chamber.
Patent pending.

Uh, do you know how to use-- can you release that?
- Yes.

We take the pieces of Penn's bill and place them here on the suspension platform and place it inside the airtight containing unit.
[light music] [exhales] [humming noise]
And I will take those back, sir.

Now, it does us no good just to take the bill apart.
We have to put it back together again.
And to do that, I have brought with me the Staats Laboratory reintegration chamber.
♪ ♪
Open sourced.

Now, Teller, it's going to be your job to monitor this unit and make sure nothing goes horribly wrong with this.
♪ ♪
Hold on a second, Teller.
For you, I have here-- here we go.
[horn honking]
It's gonna be one squeeze for "yes" and two for "no."
Got it?
[honks twice] Excellent.
Okay, we can communicate.
Now, at this moment, gentlemen, you'll notice you have some safety goggles in front of the jars in front you.
We'll put them on at the same time together on the count of three so it looks all synchronized and cool.
Ready?

Yeah.

What's gonna happen, now, Penn:
I'm going to have you push the red button in just a moment, and when you do, you will hear a little alarm go off.
That alarm will be your cue to take one step just back, away from the machine...
- Okay.

Understand?

Now, Teller, after that's done,
I'm going to have you push the red button on your jar.
You'll hear a little alarm go off.
That'll be your cue to take one step back from the machine for your safety, understand?
[horn honks] Excellent.

Penn, push the little red button.
[beep!

[faint beeping] [audience murmurs]
Penn, do you see your bill inside that jar?
- I do not.

It worked.

Of course it worked.

- Nice.

Teller, push the little red button.
[grand music]
♪ ♪
Hold on.

Don't approach it yet;

We have to take care of this.
We probably have some cross-contaminating radiation between the khyber and the dilithium power sources.
[laughter] [applause] [horn honks]
- Thank you.
Do you see the pieces of Penn's bill inside the jar?
Excellent.
Good.

[laughter]
I don't want to get near it.
Go ahead;

Yes.
Would that be Penn's signature on the bill?
Yes, it is, ladies and gentlemen.
Look at that.
Not only Penn's bill, but it has reconstituted together back into one single, solitary piece of... [laughter]
That's, uh... [laughter]
This is not a failure, ladies and gentlemen.
No, you see... the bill did teleport from that side of the stage to that side of the stage, and it does have Penn's signature still intact.
And not only that, but Penn now has a wonderful souvenir of our time together on stage.
And that's not failure, ladies and gentlemen.
This is redefined objectives.
Science!

I believe that's yours.

- Thank you very much.

Thank you very much, sir.

Thank you very much.
- Dyno Staats!
Aw!
That was so cool.
I love that you incorporate science in magic.
- I've always loved science, yeah.
- Yeah.
- And ever since I was a little kid watching a lot of science fictiony movies, you know, everything from "Jurassic Park" to "The Fly"
to "My Stepmother is an Alien,"
all those fun movies that are really cool.
- Yeah, and you get to wear the cool goggles.
- I do.

- Those are amazing.

- Yeah, and how long does it take you to do your mustache?
[laughter]
- That's the question, isn't it?

- In the morning, it only takes me, like, a minute to put wax in it and get it straight and--

It took me a lot longer to grow it.
- [laughs] All right.
Well, let's go see what the boys have to say.
- Well, you know, Dyno, that wasn't just magic.
That was also...science!
[thunderclap] [laughter]
See, it's--it's our show.

- Holy crap.

[laughter]
- That's a terrific act.

- We liked the whole theme and everything else, the Dr. Frankenstein, the throwing the switch.
All of that stuff you did was just fabulous.
The lab coat is wonderful.
I think we'd look really, really good in them.
The props are beautiful, that whole steampunk theme.
The idea of doing the mismade bill, which is a standard, with a signature and a transposition from one side to the other is a really nice use of that, having it signed and mismade with the reference to "The Fly" movie
makes the mismade bill mean something, which it usually doesn't.
We liked all of it.
We're not going to give any flap about the props or any of it.
And, you know, you're right;

[thunderclap]
Boy, that's fun to do.
We think we have a pretty good idea how you did it.
What do you think?
- Uh, well, I think their hypothesis is fairly close to accurate.
- Well, thank you so much.
Dyno Staats, ladies and gentlemen.
[applause]
We have plenty more magicians to mess with your head, including our headliners, Penn and Teller!
So stick around.
[jazz music] [cheers and applause]
[jazz music] [cheers and applause]
- Welcome back to "Fool Us."
I predict that you're about to meet our next magician.
- I had a past that I am not proud of.
I was what was known as a grifter or con man, kind of lived in the shadows.
Back in 2005 or so,
I needed to disappear.
I went on the run and ended up in Las Vegas, and I was living under a false identity, and I looked up, and Penn Jillette walked by.
For some reason, I had to say hello.
He was kind to me, and everything that he knew about me was a lie.
Penn's kindness helped me realize
I didn't like who I'd become, so I turned myself in.
I spent five years of my life in prison, practicing bizarre magic and spirit magic, every aspect from mentalism to cards to coins.
I've been performing magic since I walked out of prison.
Now here I am as my true self, trying to con Penn and Teller with magic.
[applause]
- With three randomly selected members of our audience, here is the mysterious Aiden Sinclair.
[cheers and applause]
- Ladies and gentlemen, every illusion begins with a lie.
And in the year 1848, there were two little girls in Hydesville, New York, that told a lie, and that lie became one of the greatest illusions of all time-- in fact, an illusion that's performed to this very day
but not by magicians.
It is an illusion that is performed by, well, charlatans and confidence artists.
You see, these two little girls told a lie that they could talk to the dead.
And, in fact, at this very moment, somewhere in America, there is some fraud medium who's still trying to convince people that their ghost could "cross over."
That being said, I'd like to try a little séance magic for Penn and Teller tonight.
Alyson, would you care to join us at the séance table?
It's going to be a lot of fun.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the séance table.
Now, I know there are some creepy things in front you.
There is a spirit board on the table.
A lot of people are sensitive around Ouija boards.
That's way older and creepier, so don't let that bother you.
Alyson, the doll, I know, can be a little weird.
Some people actually believe if you look them in the eyes, they'll steal your soul.
This is Evie.
Evie is one of the artifacts from the historic Stanley Hotel.
She actually belonged to a young lady whose name was Lillian McGuire.
She passed away, sadly, by her own hand in the year 1926.
Evie, some people believe she does contain a spirit, and tonight I'd like to see if that spirit will come out and play, so to speak.
And to do this, I'd like to play a game of hide and seek.
Now, obviously, not with her but with a thing.
In my pocket, I have a little bag.
And in that bag are four things-- very simple things, actually, when you think about it, nothing haunted or creepy.
In fact, I want you to be assured that all of this stuff on the table, as creepy as it is, it's not going to follow you home and haunt you or possess you with demons or give you nightmares
unless it does.
So...

In my hand, I have a few things.
I have three black beads and a pearl, something that a young girl would be drawn towards.
And that's what we're going to play hide and seek with.
The idea is, we're going to place all of those things into the bag, give the bag a little mix, and I'm going to ask each of you to reach into the bag and take out a thing.
Obviously, you're either going to take a black bead, or one of you will take the pearl.
I'd like you to make this selection in complete secrecy.
Do not peek.
If you don't know what you have, there's no way I could read your body language and get a tell.
It'll truly be up to the spirit to try to find the pearl.
Are you willing to reach into the bag?
- Yes.

Please reach inside the bag.

Make sure you have something.

One thing, one thing only.
Have you got something?

- Excellent.

Sir, if you would take the next thing.
I'll look away.

Take one thing, one thing only.
You have a thing, sir?

- No peeking.
Young lady on the end, are you comfortable taking a thing, one thing, one thing only?
And, Alyson, the last thing is all yours.
You can take the whole bag if it's easier to reach in there that way.
Once you have something, hide it in your hand.
- Okay.

And just throw the bag away.
We won't need that again, because it's not about me;

What I'd like to do is see if there is a spirit present within Evie.
So I'd like you to focus all of your attention on her, and you may get a sense that she wants to communicate with you.
You may start to feel your skin prickle.
You might feel a little tap on your shoulder.
If anything like that happens, do let us know.
Do keep your hands in plain view so she can clearly see them.
And, Evie, if you are present with us this evening,
I'd like you to just give us a sign.
It can be any sign at all.
Let us know that your presence is here, and perhaps you could actually tell us on what side of the table that pearl is.
If you could just... audience:

So you guys are off the hook.
- [laughs]
- Would you open your hand?
Do you have a black bead?

- Ladies and gentlemen, that is one.
Do you have a black bead?
That is two.
You can place it on the table, sir.
No nightmares for you.

- Good.

It's the eye contact thing, I think, but very simple.
One of you, we now know, obviously has the pearl.
One of you, obviously, has a black bead.
I'd like to use the spirit board to give her a way to truly communicate with you.
What I'd like you both to do is focus on that spirit board there.
What I'm hoping is this.
I'm going to ask each of you to say a phrase, and that phrase will be, "Evie, I have the pearl."
One of you will tell the truth, and one of you will lie.
I'm hoping that she might give a sign to whoever tells the truth.
Are you comfortable saying the phrase?
- Mm-hmm.

"Evie, I have the pearl."
- Evie, I have the pearl.
- Did you feel anything?
Little tingle, little tap, anything at all?
- Mm-mm.

Alyson?
- Evie, I have the pearl.
[dramatic musical flourish]

- What a delight.
- I'm going to stand over here.
[laughter]
So I'm going to go with you.

- Young lady, would you open your hand?
Do you have a black bead?

- Alyson, do you have a pearl?
- Oh, I must.
- Ladies and gentlemen, the spirits have spoken.
[applause] Thank you very much, guys.
You can leave it there on the table.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for coming up.
You guys can return to your seats.
Alyson, thank you so much.
- All right!

- Aiden Sinclair!
- Wow.

[applause]
So you work at a haunted hotel?
- Well, we prefer to think of it as a historic hotel.
- Right.
- You know, people get married there every day.
They have anniversaries, family reunions.
It's a happy place... unless you get the heck scared out of you.
But no, it's a wonderful hotel.
- What attracted you to magic?
- Honestly, when I got in trouble,
I knew a little bit, and when I went away, I studied.
And I knew that because of-- my crimes were really kind of deception-based.
And I think everybody has a gift, and, unfortunately, mine was a gift of deception.
That being said, there are positive ways to use it.
And what's cool about it now is that I spend most of my time not performing working with at-risk kids, kids that are at that age where they're just about to get in trouble.
And if you can get one of those kids to stay in school, graduate, and do something, it's an amazing thing, so...
- Absolutely.
- I'm very thankful.
- Well, and you're such an inspiration, showing them how you turned it around.
- You know, nobody wants to go to jail.
Nobody wants to go to prison.
And, honestly, it's not fun.

But I went on my terms, and I'm able to have the life I have today because of that decision.
And my life is exponentially better.
- Such an inspiration.
- So thank you.
- Well, thank you for sharing your story.
Let's go to the guys and see what they'll share with us.
Penn, Teller.

- I'm still reeling from the-- from seeing you again.
- It's an honor.
- You had an accent back at that time.
- I did.

- I do.

A very heavy accent, which I believed completely, by the way.
- And I'm sorry that I fooled you then.
[laughter]
It was not--it was not my desire to do any harm.
- Oh, no, I know that.
- Your hospitality has changed my life, so I can't thank you enough.
- And I'm so glad you've come around.
And you've also picked an area where we care very much about honesty.
- Likewise.

And you did a very wonderful job putting that in historic context.
I think that it's really important to say--you know, everybody thinks, when they see one of these things in a magic show, they wouldn't be fooled.
But in the real environment when people are doing this, they are being fooled day in and day out.
- Every day.
- And scammed out of lots of money.
And, more than that, scammed out of the respect and the love and the dignity of people that have passed on.
- Very much so.
- I'm so glad you're doing it right.
And also you've done that by putting a frame around it.
And we liked the whole outfit.

- We like the tie.

We like the jacket.
We really like the rings.

- We like the pants, the shoes.
Everything gives that whole impression, makes the whole trick work.
- It does.

- And even though we might have a slight idea,
I don't think the audience had the remotest idea of how anything was working on any of this.
I think you fooled almost everyone in the room.
Unfortunately, we don't think...

- The two people right here.
So good to see you again.

Thank you very much.

- Thank you so much.

- So good to see you again.

- I'm so glad...

This is because of you.
both:

- Aw.

Ladies and gentlemen.

[cheers and applause]
Enjoying our show?
Well, we aren't finished with you yet.
More outstanding illusions on the way.
[jazz music] [cheers and applause]
[jazz music] [cheers and applause]
- Welcome back.
So far, no one's fooled Penn and Teller.
Let's see if our next act has what it takes.
- I have a background in contemporary circus.
I combine theatrical pieces with mime, magic, and object manipulation.
Sometimes you see a picture of something, like surreal paintings like René Magritte and Salvador Dali, and you think,
"How could I make that into a magic trick?"
You should be able to take a snapshot anywhere in the act and it's an interesting picture.
I like the classical silent acts, and I want to create the same feeling.
I think that magic should be so clear that you don't have to say anything.
[cheers and applause]
- Our next magician will leave you speechless.
Here is Axel Adler.

Beautiful.

- All right, while they talk, let's discuss.
Are all of your tricks silent, or do you...
- I do some talking tricks also but mostly silent, because you can travel anywhere in the world and perform.
- And you're from Sweden?
- Yes, I'm from Stockholm, Sweden.
- Nice.
[applause]

- If they can't figure it out, will you tell us how it's done in Swedish?
- I can tell you now in Swedish.
How is that?

- Um... [speaking Swedish]
- That's basically what it sounds like when Penn talks.
- [laughs]
So that's how it's done.
- Yeah.

- All right, well, let's just hear the same thing in English, maybe, from Penn, 'cause that's what it's gonna sound like in my brain.
- Boy, we are so glad we studied Swedish.
That was really worth it.
It made this part of the show a lot easier.
What a beautiful act.
What a really beautiful act.
And, you know, one thing the audience may not know that's so nice about this is, a lot of the acts we have on here are fairly angly, you know?
You can watch them from, well, sometimes two seats and that's all they look good from.
This works good all around.
You don't have anything that's angly.
It's just beautiful.
It's just you out there-- your mime, your moving.
All the strength involved in that that's hidden is really--is really wonderful and terrific.
And just a whole different flavor of act.
I mean, I don't know if it's a Swedish flavor of act, but we have acts from all over the world, and this is a whole different style from a lot of other things we do.
We not only liked it;
we really, really, really liked it.
We think we have a pretty good idea how you did most of the stuff, but, man, did we love it.
We just dug it all the way.
- Thank you.
- Did you understand anything in there?
- Yeah, I really understand it.
- [laughs]
- All right, well, thank you so much.

- Welcome back.
It takes all kinds to fool Penn and Teller, and this next act is truly one of a kind.
Take a look.
- When I was growing up,
I was a very solitary kid, and I could spend hours and hours in my room reading.
Human beings are story-consuming machines.
I tend to look at each piece of magic as a story.
I write the end first.
That's just an easy way for me to structure my work.
The ideal scenario is, at the end of this piece of magic,
Penn and Teller look at each other and they go,
"Mm-mm-mm.
"You got it.
You fooled us."
That's my ideal scenario.

'Cause can I share the trophy if we did?
'Cause, like, that was kind of me.
- That was all you.
- [laughs]
- Now, this has a cool backstory.
- Yeah, what is that?
- About a year ago, I was hit by a car...
- Ooh.
- Outside of the airport in Chicago.
And the impact snapped my leg in two places.
- Ah, this is not a cool story so far.
- Well, it has a happy ending.
- Okay.
- So I was out of commission for three months.
I couldn't walk.

- Ugh.
- So to maintain my sanity...
- Mm-hmm.
- While I was stuck in the house for months on end,
I decided to focus all my energy on developing one new piece of magic that I could then perform in the show when I recovered.
- Yeah.
- And you've just experienced the result of that three months of effort.
- Aw, that's amazing.
- Yeah.

[applause]
So...
I don't really want to break my leg to come up with something that cool, but what a great way to turn a bad situation into something positive.
- Exactly, and it's totally ruined the showbiz phrase "break a leg."
- Yeah.
- I cannot say it to anyone anymore.
- No, no, you just say "good luck"
at that point, yeah.
Ready to find out what they think?
Gentlemen?
- Uh, I think we can figure this out.
Uh, I think we're almost there.
All we'd like you to do is break both our legs.
[laughter]
Leave us in the hospital for a year, and we believe we can get it.
- Happily.
- We don't think there's a deck switch.
We don't think there's marked cards.
We don't think there's double backers.
We don't think there's double facers.
Uh...we don't think jack.
[laughter]
We have no idea, I mean no idea.
- Oh, my god.

- That's a fool!
[applause]
You fooled them!

- Thanks for helping.
- Oh, my god, that's amazing.
We did it!

[applause]
That was so cool!
Whoo!
That's fantastic!
David Parr, everybody!
[cheers and applause]
Yay!
We still have one last trick up our sleeves, and it's a doozy.
Our very own Penn and Teller are up next.
Stick around.
[jazz music] [cheers and applause]
[jazz music] [cheers and applause]
- For the past 40 years, not only have Penn and Teller been dazzling audiences, but they've also been pissing off other magicians.
Here they are carrying on both traditions.
Penn and Teller!
[cheers and applause]
- You know, the most exclusive private magic club in the world is called The Magic Circle.
It's in London.
Our friend David Copperfield is a member.
The judge on this show, our mentor, Johnny Thompson, is a member.
Amazing Randi is a member.
And we were thrilled, 'cause recently they got in touch with us.
They have a museum right there on their property there in London.
They were doing an exhibit on the bullet catch, a very famous American trick.
We have a version of it, and we were thrilled, 'cause they wanted some memorabilia for their museum.
So we sent them the actual helmets we wore the first time we performed that trick, sent them a picture to go with it, even wrote an article for their magazine.
And then we said to them, "Well, you know,
"we sent that all off.
Do we get to be members?"
And they said no.
[laughter]
And the reason was their bad translation of this Latin motto, "Indocilis Privata Loqui,"
which they have mistranslated into "not likely to give away secrets."
And The Magic Circle said in so many words that they don't care about magic as an art form.
They don't care about magic as entertainment.
They only care about magic as keeping secrets, a little coven of old men in London keeping their stupid little secrets.
[laughter]
And as you know, we've been known to give away a magic secret or two.
So we wondered if we could actually do a magic trick successfully while giving away a lot of the stuff we've given away on TV about that very trick.
And the first major thing we gave away in 1985, we were on the David Letterman television program, and we said that all blindfolds used by magicians were fake.
We stated that categorically, and we stand by that.
We have someone to help us here.
What is your name, our newest friend?
- Leah.

My name is Penn.

Now, Leah, you're going to be a blindfold that cannot be faked.
Your job, Leah, is to make sure that Teller can't see.
And no reason to bite out his eyeballs.
Just temporarily take the heels of your hands.
Put them right over Teller's eyes just like that.
And no need to be gentle;

Just like that, Leah.
Now, make sure he can't see.
The other thing we're accused of giving away, which is ludicrous, because everybody already knew this, but we have mentioned marked cards.
Now, marked cards are very, very hard to check for.
Even professional gamblers sometimes can't do it.
But Leah's going to.
The cards are going to be dealt, Leah, face down into Teller's right hand.
Now, if they were marked, which they are not, if they were marked,
Teller would have to see the back of those cards for the marked cards to work.
Your job: make sure he can't see at all and also that he doesn't turn his head, okay, Leah?
That's your whole job.
I'm going to do the card trick for somebody in the audience here.
How about you, sir, with the glasses, front row?
Right up here.
[applause]
And what is your name, my newest friend?
- Tim.

Now, Tim, if you want to do a card trick, one of the easy ways to do it is to know what card is gonna be picked in advance.
That's called a card force.
We gave that away on the Johnny Carson television program.
And one of the easiest card forces and also one that's used by professional magicians, one right now on The Strip, is to have 52 cards that are all exactly the same.
They just have a card selected and know what card it's gonna be.
But Tim's gonna show you that those cards are not all the same, are they, Tim?
I'm going to try to show you all of them.
You can see them.

Another way to force a card is with sleight of hand, Tim.
You can just take a--you can take sleight of hand-- we gave this away in a TV special-- and force the bottom card or the top card, even a middle card if you hold the break under it.
But I'm going to make sure there's no sleight of hand, because they're going to be right in Tim's hand.
I'm going to give you a bunch of the cards here, Tim.
Just take those right there.
And just--I'm not even gonna look at you, but fan them out like this.
Just fan them out like this.
And just look at one of the cards in your hand.
Look at one of them.
Just look--think of it.

Don't cut to it.

Just think of one of the cards you're seeing in your hand.
You got one of those, Tim?

- Okay, just think of it.
You didn't indicate it in any way, right?
- Nope.

Close up the fan, and now give the cards a good shuffle, Tim.
Give them a good shuffle.
Or give them that kind of shuffle.
That's fine too.
But mix them up so you have no idea.
And you only thought of the card, right?
- Yup.

So you don't even know where that card is in the deck, do you?
And we'll mix it up with the cards that I shuffled, and now there's no idea where your card is in that deck.
- Nope.
- And you're the only one in the world that knows what your card is.
- Hopefully.
- Now, one of the techniques used in magic is to confuse the sequence of events.
Now, I really do not want to do that now, okay?
Now, I did not force the card on you.
Is that right, Tim?

- You're sure there's no secret whispering or any sort of psychological thing right there.
So I don't know what the card is.
Now, I'm going to now take these cards and hand them to you.
The order of the cards will not change.
I'm not going to touch them again, okay?
So remember that.
I don't know what the card is.
No one in the world does.
You've got the cards in your hands now.
Now that they're safely in your hands, say the name of the card you just thought of.
- Sevens of hearts.
- Seven of hearts, okay.
Now, you're going to go over there, Tim, and you're going to stand on this side of Teller so he can still be seen by the camera.
You're going to deal the cards one at a time from the top into Teller's right hand, face down.
- Okay.
- You will go until he stops you.
I will not say a word.
Deal them one at a time from the top, face down, in Teller's right hand.
Leah!
You make sure Teller can't see.
That's your only job.
Okay, Tim.
Go deal the cards from the top into Teller's right hand, face down.
[laughter]
- All right, Teller!
[laughter]
He stopped you.
Leah, for even a moment, did he get a glimpse of those cards?
- No.
- Tim, face the audience.
Are you sure that card was not forced on you?
- Yes.
- You had no idea where it was in the deck.
- No.
- Loudly, the name of the card you just thought of, Tim.
- Seven of hearts.
- Look at the next card.
Show it to the audience.
Right in front of your chest.
Hold it still.
[cheers and applause]
Out of a shuffled deck, a simply thought-of card.
You can keep that card with you.
Thanks so much, Tim.
Thank you so much, Leah.
Thanks, Tim.

And, you know, Magic Circle, we have a seal too.
It's dedicated to you.
It looks like this.
Magic Circle, we don't want to be members of your stupid club anyway.
[laughter and applause]
- Wow.
Ah!
Well, we gave you a taste of every type of magic tonight.
What else would you expect from Vegas but a magic buffet?
Dig in with us again next week.
Good night!
[cheers and applause]
