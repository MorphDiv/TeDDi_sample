You can see all the ugliness.
Are you coming for a drink?
Why?
I'm meeting someone.
I thought you needed to get home?
Yes... to get changed.
You said that last week, too.
Yes, but I didn't mean it then.
Here we have two characters in parallel narratives.
But the protagonist in Steinberg's work is drowning in the author's obstinate reliance on detail.
As if the scent of a long gone perfume... or the mention of margarine from GDR times somehow invests his character's life with authenticity.
This is very different with Erpenbeck.
She is less fixated on objects than on fate.
She writes about death.
That death robs people of all possibilities imaginable.
My son.
We constantly argue about the Unrechtsstaat.
My son is of the opinion that the GDR was a state devoid of any justice.
Next time you want to talk about me and my opinions in front of others... then warn me please because it bothers me.
You know what bothers me?
That the lectures are reduced to summaries... idiotic precis.
Coffee breaks... ridiculous.
Let me.
It's all right.
Let me.
You were late today.
Yes.
I met someone, Papa.
What about Natalie?
I've told you.
She's gone back to Canada.
You didn't tell me anything.
What's her name?
Clare.
Is she German?
Australian.
Why do you always choose tourists?
How was your date?
Which... which date?
The one just recently.
Come on tell me!
Yes?
I think you've got my cup.
Sorry.
It's okay.
I'll wash it.
It's not a problem.
I'm sorry, Andi.
I'll do it.
Sorry.
Thanks.
It's alright.
Stay calm.
Your mother would like to see you.
Why?
You're her son.
She called.
She left us.
Defected.
I don't want to see her.
How many stitches?
Twelve.
Let me see!
It's okay, Papa.
I just want to have a look.
Like Jesus.
How did you do this?
When I was renovating...
I slipped with the chisel...
You shouldn't cover it.
It's infected.
Leave it!
If you want to renovate, I can give you the number of someone.
Can we just continue to play?
Please.
That was very good.
Team.
Work.
Mr Werner?
Understand?
Franka.
What are you doing here?
Are you alone?
How did you get my address?
I was close by and saw you.
I'm not a stalker.
The coal man let me in.
So you followed me?
Who is that?
My girlfriend.
You kept looking at me.
Sometimes we do things... without being conscious of it.
I don't know what you mean?
I think you know what I mean.
Because you made a spectacle of yourself.
If you do this again, I'll report you.
Don't make me do that.
You were supposed to wake me.
Sorry, I should have called.
Yes, my father has died.
A few days ago.
Okay.
My brother hurt his leg.
What are you doing here?
Are you by yourself?
Yes.
Can you get up?
Yes.
I don't understand you.
Let me go.
Benni.
My mother is coming.
Everything is alright.
Your boy just fell.
Thank you.
No problem.
Second floor.
I can't believe you made it.
Everything alright?
Come in.
You didn't tell me that it was a party.
I didn't tell you that it was a party?
Sorry.
How were your holidays?
Andi.
Leave it.
Does Peter mind you acting like this?
What are you talking about?
The way you throw yourself at men.
What?
Why are you like this?
Why are you like this?
I want you to go, okay!
"Tourist missing"
You're welcome.
May I go to the toilet?
What are you doing?
What's that?
