Just a moment.
Here, sweetie.
Too much ice isn't good for you.
It's my tummy, I'll have as much as I want.
You're not even ready.
We're on vacation.
You wanted to do this handball course.
So?
So hurry up or you'll be late.
Let's go!
Move it!
The bus was reported stolen two weeks ago.
Near the border.
The young woman takes the 6:35 bus to work every morning.
She left home at 6:22.
She thought it was her bus, early.
Have the bodies been frozen long?
Several months.
And the identities?
Won't be long.
Maxime.
Here, sweetie.
Bringing your kid to a crime scene?
My new childminder let me down.
And my car wouldn't...
So now you like old wrecks?
Well I like you!
Sorry, but could you keep an eye on my daughter?
Let's go.
So the bus was driven for... how long?
Not long enough for the bodies to defreeze.
Seen that?
The rose in the buttonhole.
Only men.
All well dressed, manicured, smart haircuts, suits, ties...
Unworn.
They were dressed post-mortem.
Why?
To celebrate something?
Maybe.
But what?
No idea.
The arrival of spring?
We have ten names so far.
They have one thing in common, they've all been missing for at least three years.
At least six of them were reported missing.
Philippe Andrieux, went missing three years ago.
Schenbeck and Philippon, three years and two months.
The pathologist says their joints were smashed.
Know what that means?
This maniac planned from the start to put them in that bus.
You see that bus?
Watch.
There.
It's not very clear.
Can't see if it's a man or woman.
How the fuck is that possible?
He just appears at the wheel.
No one walks across the depot, no one jumps over the fence.
Maybe he was a passenger.
He got on, somewhere in town, sat at the back, waited until the end of the route, got down and hid...
He waited till much later to get behind the wheel, when there was hardly anyone on the roads.
You know what?
All the wack jobs converge on this region!
We haven't released your loved ones' identities.
You should know that the media will try to get statements or interviews.
You are free to act as you see fit, but we advise you against collaborating with them.
They want your emotions, your tears...
They'll twist and deform what you tell them.
They'll say they understand your pain, but it's a lie.
Your sons, your husbands, your brothers, for some of you...
We're going to have to get to know them, know who they were, their backgrounds...
A ghost bus!
Why there in particular, and not somewhere else?
To be undisturbed.
That road goes nowhere.
Yes, and the name?
How does he choose his victims?
No idea yet.
Maybe at random.
No, there's no such thing.
Random is just an order that we don't yet understand.
Who said that?
I can't remember.
Thanks for calling.
Sandra.
What's going on?
Out of the twelve frozen cellphones, we've got three working.
Those of Fernet, Philippon and Schenbeck.
They all have a contact in common.
A woman who knew all three.
A photographer, married, two kids, living near the border for the last twenty years.
Catherine Keemer.
And you know what?
She too has been missing for three years.
Not bad!
She left on February 12th, three years ago.
She said: "Have a nice day," said goodbye to the girls, and that was all.
Did she take anything with her?
No, she just left.
No, nobody.
This is a nice place.
What do you do?
I work hard to pay the mortgage on a nice house.
I'm a sports journalist.
Where were you, two nights ago?
Barcelona, for the handball final.
Why?
Before she disappeared, was your wife often absent?
Have you been married long?
Mr. Keemer, when she disappeared, was your wife seeing other men?
I don't know.
No.
Why are you asking me these questions?
Your wife was a photographer.
Was there a room here where she worked?
A studio or some such?
Here's a list of the men we found on the bus.
Do any of them ring a bell?
URGENT DISTRIBUTION
Francois.
Yes, I know him.
Francois Schenbeck.
It seems she was intimate with our fifteen victims.
How was your relationship with her before she disappeared?
Good.
Did you share the same bed?
You want to know if we still screwed?
No, we hadn't for a while.
How long?
A year?
Did she tell you about her affairs?
Yes. but she didn't.
Did you tell her about yours?
No.
Do you think she's dead?
What do you think?
My last memory is of her waving when she dropped me off at school.
She waved and then she left.
Shell be getting hungry.
Under my desk, on the left.
Let her choose, apple and pear or apple and blackcurrant.
And make sure she drinks, because she never asks.
You know what still scares me after 20 years in this job?
People's lives.
The lives that go on behind all these walls.
Did you check his Barcelona story?
Yes, and confirmed it.
Could it still be him?
Doing away with his wife and all those she loved?
Who, then?
Catherine Keemer?
Is she alive somewhere?
Killing her former lovers?
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where is he?
No, Chloee, you can wear a skirt, but not that one.
Christelle wouldn't mind.
But she's your dad's new girlfriend, she's not your mother.
Sorry, to ask you this, but she loves you.
It's just until I find a new childminder.
Goodnight.
I told you I didn't do it on purpose!
Stop lying, Chloee, and don't talk to me like that!
My room's tidy.
What?
My room's tidy.
We'll be OK, you and me.
She disappears and starts abducting the guys she'd been screwing.
What did she do with them before putting them in the bus?
No, it doesn't hold up.
Why not?
Fred and the guys are looking.
Slaughterhouses, refrigerated trucks, warehouses...
Have you found out anything else?
No movement apart from an automatic transfer.
Really?
What's that for?
But honestly, Justin, why would she do that?
You never wanted to kill yours?
I can imagine you wanting to.
Shit!
OK, it's four months late, but I don't care.
We must have the tree!
That's weird.
celebrating Christmas in March.
Tell it to my son!
He's spent the last six winters on Reunion island with his mom.
You first.
An escort for a night.
Seriously, when did you last spend the night with a guy?
What does that mean?
I worry about you, that's all.
Well, don't.
Hold on a second, Max is calling me.
I'll be right back.
Yes, Maxime?
She couldn't be faking it?
Are certain substances responsible for her psychological state, or is the amnesia a result of post-traumatic shock?
The last total amnesiac I treated only regained some memory.
Some periods of his life came back surprisingly clearly, while other parts were forgotten or fantasized.
Made up, you mean?
Fabricated by his brain.
You mentioned post-traumatic shock.
What sort of shock can cause total memory loss?
One powerful enough to make the body and brain refuse to accept the truth.
A sort of total burn-out.
I know you don't really understand what's happened to you, you feel lost and confused by all that's going on.
I'm here because I too want to know what happened to you.
Is it all right if we talk a little?
OK.
Do you recognize any of these men?
Take your time.
No.
Are you sure?
No.
OK.
And this man?
Do you remember him?
No.
You don't remember being married?
No.
OK.
Do you remember your daughters?
No.
When you woke up in that car yesterday, what was your first thought?
You kept repeating: "Where is he?" Who were you talking about?
I can't remember.
For the moment we've got nothing.
We've found her cellphone.
but it hasn't been used for three years.
The car's mileage?
Wait, I'll have a look.
Excuse me.
43,450 kilometres.
That's 80 kilometres more than at its last safety inspection, three years ago.
Ciao, see you later.
She doesn't want to see us.
Well, maybe she's... afraid.
No, of what will happen, of...
Of hurting you.
You know, she's still in shock.
Maybe it's better to wait two or three days, for the effects of the medication to wear off.
Can I confide in you?
When I was about your age, my mom had a car crash.
And when I went to see her,
I realized she was struggling to remember things, people... and even me.
And it hurt.
But I just had to give her time.
How much time?
With my mom it was a few days, but it depends on the person.
Sandra.
Catherine Keemer had a baby six months ago.
A baby, six months ago?
The first test results prove it quite categorically.
She gave birth six months ago.
A baby?
Whose?
I want to get her home.
That will be the best solution.
For her.
She needs to be back with the girls, I'm sure.
Mr. Keemer.
I understand what you and your daughters want, but I'm afraid that won't be possible for the moment.
The doctors agree with my client.
Yes, I know.
Are we to understand that Mrs. Keemer is in custody?
Quite simply, yes.
You really think she did it?
You think she killed all the men on that bus?
I'm sorry, Mr. Keemer.
Did you know your wife had been renting an apartment for five years?
MAIL SORTING
The neighbors say they've never seen or heard anyone.
Everything is pristine.
Not a speck of dirt, no prints.
The sheets are new, the carpet's been shampooed.
Recently?
There's an old tube of toothpaste in the bathroom.
I don't think anyone's been here for years.
Fifteen men, who all spent at least a night with Catherine Keemer.
They're all the men she's known, except for her husband,
Oliver Keemer.
The first men she met were Schenbeck and Andrieux.
She probably took these three to her apartment.
Look, Fiinder.
Downloaded three and a half years ago.
How does it work?
Wherever you are.
it suggests available people within a radius of five kilometres.
There, right now, fifteen minutes from where you are.
Goodbye, delighted to have met you!
Oh, yes.
Go, Mom!
Go, Mom!
Oh, no!
Usually you don't want us to eat stuff that's full of chemicals.
Just promise me you won't tell your dad we've been eating this junk.
No.
Here, happy birthday.
I was wondering when I'd get my present.
Don't squash your sister!
Happy birthday, shrimp.
Hi.
Great.
See you, sweetie.
Can't you leave them with me a bit longer?
That's what we agreed, Eric.
See you in two days.
See you.
It doesn't spark any memories?
None.
You remember the baby you had.
You lied to me.
Didn't you?
Maybe you lied about all the rest too.
Did you kill the men on the bus?
I don't know.
Will you come with me?
FROZEN BODY
Got my present?
Don't be late.
Overcooked turkey gets dry.
Overcooked or not, turkey's always dry!
A capon is much better.

Mysterious death in regional bus
Suicide on the Brussels highway
A young woman threw herself under the wheels of a car
Emilie Sauvage, the young woman who disappeared nine months ago along with her partner has been found dead.
Two buses, five years apart, almost the same scenario.
They'd been missing nine months, the guy's found dead on a bus, and his wife appears the next day, as if by magic.
Yeah, but this guy was found all alone on that bus.
200 kilometres away from where our bus was found.
And was this guy frozen?
And thirdly...
she's seen wandering along the highway and jumps under a car.
Dad, when do we eat?
Hey, Denis!
The two cases aren't linked.
Do you know how Anthony Kerouac was dressed, five years ago?
Suit and tie.
After he's been on the road for nine months?
She has a point.
Justin, call your pal.
But purely to prove that you're wrong.
Put this on, and do the bunny.
Well, Chloee, I don't know.
We'd planned to do stuff together this weekend.
You can't just go to London for the weekend without any warning.
All right?
All right?
What is it that pisses you off so much?
That he's making a new life for himself?
Playing happy families with his new girlfriend?
With your girls as optional extras?
Do you still love him?
No.
It's not a bad idea.
Is your pal going to call or what?
Sandra.

A body was found in it.
No one would drive it after that.
It's the only one, you can't miss it.
With all the gas left in the tanks.
The patient's in a bad way!
He's going into cardiac arrest.
