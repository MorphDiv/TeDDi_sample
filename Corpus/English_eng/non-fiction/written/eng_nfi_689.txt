[Hiccup] This changes everything.
[gripping instrumental music playing] [grunts]
[laughs insidiously]
That's a very nice axe, Mr. Throk.
Uh...
Look, I'm all for winning friends and influencing people, but this mission has gone talons up.
[dragons growling, hissing]
Stop!
Viggo used us as a distraction so he could steal your Eruptodon, but without us knowing.
And yet, our Eruptodon is gone, our village is in peril from the lava flow, and you hold me in front of your Night Fury.
Back off, bud.
We will prove it to you.
We'll go rescue your dragon and bring it back.
I'll even leave some people here to help you fight the lava.
Only your best.
Heather's a survivalist, she's dealt with lava before.
And Ruff and Tuff...
Oh, what do we have here?
Dart throat stings.
-Losing control of my vocal chord-- -[laughing] [both grunt, groan]
[Tuffnut] I'm fine.
Uh, let's just say they... have a lot of experience cleaning up stuff.
I accept your offer, on one condition,
I must travel with you
I thought you didn't fly on dragons.
I will do whatever it takes to save The Great Protector.
Then it shall be done.
What rhythm?
[both groaning]
[groans]
Come on, it's up to us to stop the lava flow.
Thor help me.
We shall not fail you, my queen.
[indistinct chatter]
You can fly with me and Toothless.
-We'll start canvassing the-- -[rustling] [growling] [grunting]
Get us outta here, Hookfang!
[grunts, groans]
-[Mala grunting] -[man screaming in pain]
She is definitely coming with us.
And to think you didn't want her to come, Hiccup.
[sighs in exasperation]
[Stormfly growls]
[both growling] [growls, roars]
[Stormfly screeches] [chuckles nervously]
Me?
It's quite a rush, isn't it?
It's called personal space.
I think, with a little less mutton and a little more exercise, you will be perfect.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
It has been foretold that a man from afar would come to my island and save me on the field of battle, and that man will become my king.
Snotlout, you are that man.
[laughing excitedly] Oh, my Thor, this is awesome!
Did you hear that, Hookfang?
Finally someone recognizes my worth!
Forget being chief, I'm Snotlout, King of the...
Viggo and the Eruptodon, traveling without any backup?
[chuckles] That's weird, right?
[Eruptodon growling]
A funny thing happens when you remove an animal from the safety of its home.
At first, it becomes disoriented and-- [roars]
Aggressive.
Then, finally, the creature accepts its fate.
-[roaring] -[clanging] [growls weakly]
It loses interest in killing its adversaries and becomes more concerned with its own survival.
Or at the very least, it becomes someone's expensive toy.
All in good time, brother, all in good time.
He has a very important job to do for us first.
One that poor Hiccup will never see coming.
And you're not used to aerial combat.
Remember, Hiccup, if you fail me--
Or perhaps I'll have my new king do it for me.
Ah.
Unlike you guys, she recognizes royalty when she sees it.
But don't worry, Hiccup, I'll make it a quick and painless death.
Oh, gods.
[Snotlout] What a muttonhead.
Okay, everyone, let's ambush him before he can react.
Fire!
Look out, bud!
Spine shots!
Nice shooting, Stormfly.
[Dragon Hunters clamoring]
I don't see Viggo or Ryker, they must be down below.
Then we're gonna need to clear the deck.
Hiccup and his dragon are amazing.
I've never seen anything like it.
Yeah, but remember, I'm the guy who saved you on the field of battle, right?
After the person foretold the story about the thing?
The way those two fly through the air in perfect harmony, it's magical.
You know he only has one leg, right?
[growls excitedly]
Abort!
-[Fishlegs screams] -[Meatlug roaring] [screaming, grunting]
[Dragon Hunters screaming] [indistinct shouting]
[roars] [whimpering] Oh!
[Dragon Hunter screaming] [grunts]
[roars] [both screaming]
[Meatlug growling]
If any of 'em move, Meatlug, eat 'em.
[both exclaim in fear]
[Dragon Hunters screaming] [splashing] [growls]
[roaring]
The hunters he left behind on the island were another misdirect.
Oh, I hate to say it, Hiccup, but this recent failure...
I really wish there was something that could be done.
This does place me in quite a quandary.
On the one hand, your valor in battle and the grace in which you fly your dragon are undeniable, on the other hand...
[Toothless growls questioningly]
There is a possibility.
New rulers are granted one pardon for condemned Vikings.
If you feel it is in order, my king.
Only one pardon, huh?
Umm.
Hmm.
I mean, I suppose I could use it.
Probably score some points with the peasantry, you people.
But I wonder if it's too early in my kinghood to burn my only pardon.
I'll have to think about it.
And don't assume you're automatically invited to my parade.
I get a parade, right?
Okay, if Viggo wanted us to go north, he is definitely heading south.
I just hope Heather and the twins are having better luck with the lava than we are with our new monarch.
Slice 'em down, Windshear.
[all cheering]
Look at all of them down there, Ruff.
Waving their shovels in anticipation of our heroism.
[all shouting]
[Tuffnut] Woohoo!
Oh.
[sighs]
Objection, Your Heather, the defense purports you to be out of said jurisdiction.
[exclaims angrily]
But we will agree to a short recess.
If you're feeling airsick, we'll be landing soon to water the dragons.
No, the Eruptodon.
He must constantly eat lava, or he will die.
When I was just a little girl, there was an earthquake that disrupted the lava flow.
It wasn't long before the Eruptodon was frantic and starving.
He became so weak, he wasn't able to fly to another food source.
Only deep prayer for the lava to return saved our beloved dragon, but, now...
Mala, look, a starved dragon is no good to Viggo.
He has our Dragon Eye, he must know this about the Eruptodon.
In the meantime, that can help us.
We'll fly over active volcanoes until we spot him.
[Mala] If only it were so easy.
The Eruptodon doesn't need an active volcano to eat.
Its appetite is insatiable and its desire immense, so much so that it will eat through the crust of a dormant volcano until it erupts.
Dormant volcano?
The snow-capped peak at Dragon's Edge is a dormant volcano.
Classic Maces and Talons move.
Viggo's gonna use the Eruptodon to destroy our home.
Come on there, steady as you go.
[growls, roars]
[Eruptodon roars]
Oh, I love it when a good plan falls perfectly into place.
We'll see, brother.
[roars]
[Ryker] We'll see.
[Throk] Come on.
I mean, whatever we were gonna try next, that would have totally worked.
It would have been genius, whatever it was.
[Tuffnut] Yes, and what would it have been?
I'm so sorry.
[shouting angrily]
So not cool.
Who benches their stars at the end of a game?
[indistinct chatter] [both screech]
[Ruffnut] He said, knock it off!
[both roar in delight]
[rumbling]
I don't think we can go straight over the island.
[Dragon Hunter] That's right, move that ballista over here!
Fire!
Look out!
We'll have to try to fly around the Edge.
I don't think that will work either.
[clamoring]
We're totally overpowered.
Wait, wait, wait, I got it!
Fly as close as you can to the Hunters' ships.
[Dragon Hunters grunting]
[screaming]
Your gamesmanship makes me proud to call you my friend.
[roars affirmatively]
Clever, Hiccup, very clever.
Uh, brother, is everything all right?
[exclaims in annoyance]
I'm going in.
[Stormfly screeches]
-[Astrid gasps] -[screams] Astrid!
[grunts, screams]
[screaming]
Hiccup, we're running out of time.
We'll never get past this ballista, Astrid built it.
It's suicide, Hiccup!
And I have a kingdom to think about.
So do we, Snotlout, so do we.
Okay, here's what I want you to do... [roaring]
[both grunt]
We can't get close enough.
One hit from that ballista and we are dead.
Let me worry about the ballista.
You guys fly west and draw the catapult fire.
Okay, bud, we need everything you got.
[Mala grunts]
[Dragon Hunter grunts] Whoa!
[exclaims angrily] [screams, grunts]
[groaning] [snarling]
Don't you mess with my queen!
[groans] [grunting] [exclaims in pain]
Something about our troubles being-- [exclaims angrily]
Incoming!
[Dragon Hunter grunts] [exclaims frustratedly]
Now's our chance.
[clamoring]
[roaring, chomping]
[Toothless growls]
[Eruptodon growls]
Hiccup...
[rumbling]
[rumbling]
I'm more worried about all the other dragons on this island.
What will happen to them?
If we can't stop him...
We have to stop him.
I now understand, Hiccup Haddock, you're not an enemy to dragons.
The good of the many outweighs the good of the few, but with all of this knowledge you have, what good can it do for one starving dragon?
[chomping] [rumbling]
Wait a minute, that's it.
We're not gonna kill your dragon, Mala, we're going to feed it.
Meatlug!
[roars] [growls softly]
[whimpers] [roaring loudly]
[growls in delight]
[Gronckles growling, roaring]
[growls] [chomps]
Oh, thank you.
[growls in delight, chomps]
Your dragons are not unlike our beloved Eruptodon, they will stop at nothing to protect your home.
They are truly part of your tribe.
Okay, am I the only one who thinks this is a little gross?
What?
It is a good day, a day we shall always remember.
The Great Protector has been returned, the village is safe once more, and the Defenders of the Wing have new allies in our fight against Viggo Grimborn.
Hiccup and the Dragon Riders.
[roars] [all cheering]
Watch this, she's about to introduce me as her new king.
Prepare for an epic acceptance speech.
One that I am sure will be worthy, and serve you well.
His name is Snotlout.
Hey, easy with the new goods, Throk-man.
Where do you think you're going?
I'm going to stand next to my queen and take in the steerage.
A new king must first prove his worth to Mala.
A new king must walk across the Pool of Valor.
Fine, I mean, I prove myself daily, but if it will make queenie happy... [shrieks]
[exclaims in fear]
My Snotlout is courageous, my Snotlout is brave, and my Snotlout is-- [whimpering]
Hookfang, go, go, go, go, go!
Leaving?
Better get used to that.
