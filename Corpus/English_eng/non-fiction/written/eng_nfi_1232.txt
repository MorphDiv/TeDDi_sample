Longest ball wins.
So, don't slice it again.
Mulligan, Troy.

Dad, maybe you need a new club.
Or you should try
- a different sport.

You're almost up.
There's a putt-putt down the street.
And that's how it's done.
That is gonna be tough to beat.
This is fun.

Feels like old times, you know?
You used to love coming here when you were nine.
Yeah, I remember.
I'm really glad we did this again.
Yeah.

Then you're up, hotshot.
See if you can hit the river, Dad.
All right.
- Nice swing.

Order 17, Philly cheesesteak, fries, medium soda.
Order 17, pick up, please.
Troy?
My God!

Somebody stop him!
Call 911!
Need some help!
Need a doctor!

What's this?
What's it look like?
A midlife crisis.
I didn't question you when you got a Bentley.
Well, that's because my midlife crisis came with air bags.
I'm surprised you agreed to do a psych eval on a patient.
Well, she said that I wouldn't want to pass it up and she knows me.
She?
Yeah, Dr. Levin.
She handles the interesting patients.
A man who mistook his wife for a hat, that sort of thing.
Hey, Bull,
I know why you asked me to meet you here today.
Good.

I'm glad.
I want you to know that I heard what you said about my behavior during the class action suit and you're right.
I was off my game.
But I'm back.

I'm just ready to jump right back on that horse.
Then why'd you buy a bike?
Amy?
Jason.

Amy's the head of forensic psychiatry.
Tough job.
Given our country's current mental state,
I will never be out of work.
How's the private sector treating you?
I drive a Bentley.
I hope you're still finding time to bake.
- Bull bakes?

"Better than Robert Redford"?
I do not.
It's this amazing dessert that Jason used to bring in on Fridays.
Kind of half pie, half pudding.
You know, my birthday's coming up next month.
I'm not baking you a cake.
So, tell us about this patient of yours.
Troy Dickerson is 25 years old.
Graduated from NYU... good grades, popular, athletic.
And then, a few months ago, he enrolled in the Lumansic Academy.
Lumansic?

It's a cult.
It's an alternative learning center.
Yes.

How did Troy end up here?
He was charged with murdering his father three nights ago.
At his arraignment, Troy plead not guilty.
The judge ordered a competency evaluation.
Assessment?
I think he thinks he's telling the truth.
There's just one problem.
So, that's Troy.
And that's his father, Clint, at the tee.
His demeanor shifted.
I noticed it, too.
He's dissociating.
God.
He attacked him out of nowhere.
The head injuries Clint sustained were fatal.
I'm assuming Troy doesn't have any memory of the incident.
No, he doesn't.
He's mentally blocked it.
It may be psychologically damaging for him to remember.
We've done lie detector, FMRI and several sessions.
Look, whether he claims to remember or not, it's obvious that he killed his father.
What's not obvious is why.
No history of violence.
Has Troy seen the video?
No.
Anyone got a quarter?
Fun fact...
There are no U.S. quarters dated 1933.
Okay.
Maybe I oversold the "fun" part.
But I'll bet you $20 you can't tell me the date on this quarter.
How is this supposed to help me?
Why are you here, Troy?
They... say I killed my father.
Did you?
No.
I would never do that.
I loved my dad.
So, you and Bull used to work together.
Something like that.
Just tell me the date on the quarter.
I can't when it's spinning like that.
Try.

It's an eye fixation induction.
A way to test a person's ability to transition into an altered mental state of relaxation. -
Just keep looking at it.
In fact, look right through it.
The longer you look at it, the more you can't look away.
That's it.
Keep focusing on the quarter.
Tell me about your father.
They say I killed him.
But I don't remember.
I want you to try.
I have.

It's gone.
He's gone.
Why can't I remember?
What's wrong with me?
We're gonna figure this out... together.
What do you think?
We're taking this case.
I thought you were just evaluating him, Bull.
You saw the video.

What I saw on that video confirms what I saw in that room:
A young man who is highly susceptible to hypnotism and verbal triggers.
Troy is not guilty of this crime.
He was brainwashed to kill.
You are getting very sleepy.
Your screen's filthy and it smells like peanut butter.
Come on, concentrate.

Okay, hypnosis doesn't work.
Yes, it does work.
I know that it can be used to stop smoking or lose weight, but murder?
I saw a hypnotist at a magic show once, and he told me no one'll ever do anything that they don't want to do.
And that is why we don't base our defense on magic shows, Cable.
The human mind is pliable.
And what we want can be manipulated depending on the vulnerability of the subject and the skills of the hypnotist.
So, what's our strategy?
I say let's try to plead down to manslaughter.
No.
Troy Dickerson isn't responsible for killing his father.
He was psychologically kidnapped.
We will plead not guilty by reason of insanity.
But Troy has no history of insanity.
I mean, he's not insane, is he?
Temporarily.
To prove insanity, all we have to do is show that Troy was not in control of his actions
- at the time of the crime.

Juries aren't gonna look at Troy and think he's insane.
And they will see him kill his father in cold blood.
It's gonna be impossible to convince them that Troy's not responsible.
Troy was in an altered state when he killed his father.
He had no idea what he was doing.
The person who hypnotized him is responsible.
So, someone just told him to commit murder at 6:41 p.m.?
There was a trigger, a word, a sound, a color, an object.
Cable and Benny, I'd like you to break down everything that Troy came into contact with.
We find the trigger, we find the real killer.
Hey, Bull?
So, who do you have in mind for a defense lawyer?
Are you curious or campaigning?
Both.
Sorry I'm late.
Benny, you remember Reed Kenwood.
Yeah.

You guys really nailed the strategy on that one, but this...
I've always wanted to try an insanity defense.
- Good.

We're just getting started on the juror profiles.
Excuse me.
Have fun.
Reed?

Yeah.

What makes you think that Reed believes in hypnosis?
What makes you think I'm talking about hypnosis?
Well, if not that, then what?
I don't think you're really back yet.
I'll give you a call when we're representing a biker gang.
Troy and his dad have been coming here since he was a kid.
I have no idea what got into him.
Those cameras... did they record the murder?
Yeah, but they all show the same thing.
Troy killed his father with a four iron.
Is anyone disputing that?
Kind of.

Sorry, man.

Come on.

The police were only given one angle.
We're looking for a potential trigger or something that may have set Troy off.
These different camera angles may help explain what happened.
Yeah, which means you can come back with a warrant.

That computer's not password protected.
I can get the footage in less than 60 seconds.
Just cover me, partner.
Okay.
- Anything else?

While I'm here, I might as well get a few swings in.
Would you mind setting me up?
Okay.
For you...
That should do it.
Come on.
- Yeah, it's nice.

- Hey, thank you.

Thank you.
W-wait, wait.
Where do I get the balls?
Come on.
You get it?
Ace in the hole.
Don't be offended, but I'm taking the subway back to work.
Come on, you know you liked being on the back of my bike.
Yeah, as long as you're not driving.
I am so proud of each and every one of you.
You have taken the first step on a long and luminous journey towards realizing your potential.
I'm Thornton Grey.
Founder of the Lumansic Academy.
My daughter Rachel and I started this learning center two years ago with one goal in mind:
You.
That's right.
Yes, all of you, because, here, we're all family.
Seriously?
This guy's a talking fortune cookie.
No, I see the appeal.
Well, he's passionate, he oozes charisma.
And he puts on a great presentation.
You're not really buying into this nonsense, are you?
What matters is that Troy bought into it.
- That's why we're here.

Now how does that sound to everybody?
Hi, Benny.
Hi, Amy.
- Is Dr. Bull around?

He'll be back soon.
Cruiser or sport bike?
Sport bike.
You know your motorcycles.
My ex-husband used to restore old Harleys.
Good memories... of the bikes.
My husband, well, try to forget him every day.
So, you and Bull started dating after the divorce.
You thought that Jason and I...?

Our relationship has always been professional.
I'm sorry.
I, misread that.
I can see why you and Dr. Bull get along.
You're very quick with deductions.
I can see why you and Dr. Bull are friends.
Always observing.
Are those part of the Dickerson case?
Yes.
These are drawings Troy made.
Looks like a trident.
He also made these.
When did he start doing this?
Right after you and Bull came to see him.
You think it's got something to do with his father's murder?
Yes.
Problem is
Troy doesn't know what these drawings mean.
It's what we call "a glitch in the matrix."
It occurs when somebody has been programmed to forget an event, but their mind is desperately trying to remember.
So, I've reviewed the surveillance footage from Chelsea Piers, and in the minutes leading up to the murder, I don't see Troy talk to anybody but his father.
See if this triggers anything.
A trident.
Like the spear of Poseidon?
The gum?
- The missile.

Well, maybe Troy's secretly the god of the sea who enjoys fresh breath and nuclear-armed submarine-launched ballistic weapons.
Follow that lead last.
Our biggest challenge will be to convince the jurors that hypnotism is real.
So... how do we do that?
We hypnotize them.
Wait, you're suggesting we actually hypnotize them?
I'm suggesting the power of suggestion.
Ladies and gentlemen, as part of the voir dire process,
I'm hoping you all can...

I'm having with my girlfriend.
Think they'll buy this?
Maybe not the girlfriend part.
She says this candle smells like vanilla.
I think it smells like sandalwood.
What do you think?
Um, I'm not really sure.
Ma'am, what about you?
Vanilla.
Definitely vanilla, right?
Yeah, she's right, it's vanilla.
Jurors four and five are keepers.
It's unscented.
Neither vanilla... nor sandalwood.
The power of suggestion.
How many of you own a gun?
Prosecution wants gun owners because, statistically, they're tough on crime, but if we set the narrative right, gun owners will sympathize with Troy.
And they'll see him as the gun, and the person who hypnotized him as the one who pulled the trigger.
'Cause gun owners don't blame the gun.
Yeah.

All five jurors are acceptable to the prosecution.
Acceptable to the defense.
Hello, there.
Oatmeal.
Good choice.
I'm feeling very confident about it.
Are you always confident about your choices?
If every choice were as easy as this...
But they can be, once you're at peace with who you are.
I guess I've made a few left turns along the way.
Who hasn't?

You do seem a little restless.
Have you changed careers recently?
Yeah.
Yeah, I have.
I started out in sports and then moved into the fashion industry, and now I mostly consult on other people's appearance.
Appearance?
What you see on the outside versus what's really going on inside?
Yeah.
I'd like to understand what that means to you.
Excuse me?

Yes.

Hi, I was in the audience for your dad's speech.
It was so good, and...
I'm submitting an application.
Well, we love hearing that.
You know, this place isn't at all what I thought.
What were you expecting?
Well, you know, all that stuff online about... about Lumansic being a cult.
And that guy killing his father.
- Troy, yes.

I did.
And I really liked him.
My dad and I oversee all the first-year students ourselves, and Dad saw something really special in Troy.
He was trying to help him.
Never mind all the news.
They just want to sell stories.
Here, we zone all of that out and try to make ourselves better people.
What do you do?
So, Mr. Grey's daughter said that he took a particular interest in our client.
Thornton is the kind of guy that takes an interest in everyone.
"Thornton"?
You spoke with him?
Yeah, on my tour.
You-You got a tour?

- Weird.

They lied to me.
Hot date?
Indeed.

Thornton wants me to come to the orientation class tomorrow.
They are totally recruiting him.
And they're not giving me the time of day.
Danny, they got a whiff of your skepticism, and they don't want to take any chances.
And, Chunk, they saw you as open-minded and inquisitive.
They like the cut of your jib.
Thank you?
Congratulations, you're joining a cult.
Now, please don't kill us.
Okay, Reed, all set to go?
But I thought Benny was...
I'm gonna deliver the opening to our mock jury.
Test out our theory about Thornton Grey.
Reed's trying the case.
Mock courtroom is my domain.
Let me take a shot.
Okay, show me.
Now, these facts aren't in dispute, right?
You don't have to decide whether or not Troy killed his father.
But you do have to decide whether or not he lacked the ability to control his actions during the incident.
We're gonna prove that Troy was manipulated to kill his father by Thornton Grey, the leader of a cult camouflaged as an elite institution for higher education.
Where former students reported being subjected to ritual indoctrination.
Where they were encouraged to cut off family ties, and attended hypnotherapy sessions to control their behavior.
The mock jurors' readings spiked when Benny mentioned the tactics that Lumansic has been using.
But that is the good news.
And the bad news?
Even though the jurors believe that Thornton Grey had the skill and opportunity to hypnotize Troy, they don't yet believe he had ample motive to kill Troy's father.
Yeah, I may have a lead on that.
So, I looked into Troy's father's bank records and it turns out he was, he was paying for Troy's tuition at Lumansic to the tune of 25 grand.
Maybe his dad threatened to cut off the payments.
I mean, Thornton would've lost a lot of money.
Money is a motive for murder.
Troy was one student;
His tuition wasn't gonna make or break the school.
Just keep digging.
Patty Hearst.
Big day.
Actually, I was thinking more Donnie Brasco.
How you want me to play this when I go in?
Well, don't overthink it;

Cults, like Lumansic, target people who are searching for meaning.
Some people are curious, others have...

They can be very seductive, Chunk.
You think I'm gonna go native?
Come on, Bull.
It's not about intelligence.
Brilliant minds are co-opted by cults all the time.
Just be yourself in there, they're not gonna suspect anything.
I need you inside their practices.
And I want to know the techniques that they use on their students.
Keep your eyes open... every small detail... because the more specific we can be with the jury, the better.
And do not...
Drink the Kool-Aid.
Danny already beat you to it.
I was gonna say, "Do not be late for orientation,"
but, wow.
I thought Danny would be more proud of her rejection.
This band's called Trident Four,
I found them in Troy's music library.
Do they know "tri" means three, not four?
They're pretty post-hipster, grunge antiestablishment, so I'd say it's unclear whether they're being ironic or idiotic.
Wow.

Okay.
Interesting, right?
Any indication Troy was listening to this on the night of the murder?
Unfortunately not, but it's the best lead I have.
I mean, I've checked all his records.
He's not a fan of The Little Mermaid.
The Little Mermaid, like, King Triton?
Yeah, he carried a trident.
That's so cool that you know King Triton.
I was Ariel when I was a kid, for Halloween.
Me, too.
We should totally have a sing-along.
Yeah, you know,
I'm, I'm busy tonight.

Yeah.
Okay, well, what about, like, Tuesday?
- Busy.

Still busy.
Chunk.
So glad you've joined us.
Thank you.
I'm gonna need your cell phone.
My phone, why?
You'll get it back at the end of the session.
Sorry about the, heightened security.
She's concerned about the negative press we've been getting.
She wants to open a second campus in Brooklyn.
Wow.

It has its pros and cons.
I never want to lose sight of our mission here.
You know, something I carefully manage is being sure that I can devote ample time to each new student.
I certainly appreciate the time.
I've been thinking about something you said yesterday, about appearances.
I believe I can help you.
Really.

Techniques that allow people to access parts of their subconscious that've been holding them back from truly knowing who they are and what they want.
Chunk.
Have you ever been hypnotized?
Me?

It's possible.
But I don't remember anything.
The jury needs to see that you're a regular kid who had his whole life ahead of him.
Until someone did this to you.
Are they gonna show the video?
Of me hitting my dad?
They will.
My memories of me and my dad are... playing baseball, hiking together.
He was my coach, and he was always there for me.
How do I explain hurting the man who loved me most in this world?
I'm here to help you get through this.
But you have to help me understand what you've gone through.
Let's start with, what was your attraction to Lumansic?
Lumansic taught me how to look inward.
Find meaning in the here and now, stop trying to search for things I'll never find.
Your stepmother mentioned that your mom left when you were quite young.
Yeah, I don't even remember what she looked like.
My dad refused to show me photos.
Lumansic helped me realize that, deep down,
I resented him for that.
Enough to kill him?
Of course not.
He was my dad.
And now he's gone.
I can't believe this is happening.
I wasn't even supposed to be with my dad that night.
Where were you supposed to be?
In a session with Thornton.
Dad wanted to go to Chelsea Piers.
It was a tradition of ours.
If I'd just said no...
Troy.
It's gonna be okay.
Troy had a private session with Thornton every Thursday night at 6:00 p.m., except that night.
A last-minute cancellation.
I-It is possible that whoever hypnotized Troy to kill didn't know about the change in plans.
Maybe Troy wasn't supposed to kill his dad.
And maybe Thornton wasn't the killer after all.
No, he wasn't.
He was the target.
Troy shouldn't have been with his father the night of the murder.
He had a standing appointment with Thornton Grey at that exact time.
Someone wants Thornton dead?
We should warn him.
I see your session went well with Dear Leader.
Now we know he's not the killer, and frankly I think Lumansic has gotten a bad rap.
My God, you totally drank the Kool-Aid.
Chunk, right now this is just a theory.
We don't want you blowing your cover at Lumansic.
We need evidence.
Our insanity defense relies on the jury accepting that Troy was hypnotized and someone else was in control of his actions.
That means they're gonna have to understand how and why hypnosis works.
And they're gonna need to hear from an expert.

Have Benny prep Amy.
Chunk, about Lumansic.

Yeah, I don't think you should.
Because I disagree with your assessment of Thornton?
- No.

- Right.

Trust me.
So the prosecution will ask, Dr. Levin, what makes you qualified to evaluate Troy Dickerson?
I've evaluated over a thousand cases for both the criminal and civil courts.
Have you ever been wrong about a patient?
Yes.
How do you live with knowing that a choice you made had unintended consequences on someone's life?
I suppose you have to step back and think about why you were in that position in the first place.
Most likely it's because you've earned the right to make certain judgment calls.
And the right to make mistakes.
Honest mistakes.
Life-changing mistakes, nonetheless.
Is everything all right, Benny?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Bull thinks I lost faith in myself.
Why would he think that?
I'm sorry, I...
I got off track.
Let-Let-Let's get back to prep.
I'd love to take you to dinner tonight.
Amy, I...
I just got out of a relationship.
I think you're amazing, but I'm not ready to jump back into something.
Benny.
I think you've gotten the wrong idea about why Jason suggested we connect.
Apparently, I have a new therapist.
Good for you.
Bull, you crossed the line.
What was I supposed to do?
You're spiraling and you're certainly not opening up to me.
So you hire me a shrink?
I wouldn't say "hired."
I'm paying her in baked goods.
Don't joke.

And it's affecting your work and my work.
What do you want?
Want me to admit that, that, that I slept with Erin?
Okay, I slept with Erin, all right?
I...

And, yes, she was our client.
It was a mistake and now it's over.
We good?
Not until you're ready to admit what's really going on with you.
Sleeping with Erin was the symptom, not the problem.
In the Original Position, no one knows where they'll wind up in society.
If you start with this foundation, that's when you get true compassion.
Chunk.
Excuse me.
Really compelling.
Where'd you learn about Rawls's Theory of Justice?
I read a lot, as do you.
Listen, do you have somewhere you need to be right now?
Not necessarily, no.
Excellent.
I have a surprise for you.
Flotation therapy.
Helps you visualize, focus better.
Chunk.
I really think this can help you figure out why you've struggled to find your path in life.
Don't worry.
I'll be right out here to talk you through it.
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I want you to say the word "red."
State your name again for the record.
Red.
Yeah, but not to me.
To the jury.
They have to hear it at least 11 times for it to sink into their subconscious.
Why 11?
Repetition, enhances the power of suggestion.
By tomorrow, they'll be seeing red without knowing why.
Now, I want to work it in organically.
Can't be too overt.
That's why I picked red.
Magenta would've been much harder, so, thanks.
Counselor?
Yes.

We've all seen the video.
We all saw Troy kill his father.
The prosecution has argued that it is murder.
Plain and simple.

I agree that Troy physically caused his father's death.
But I do not agree that he should be found guilty of murder.
He doesn't look crazy.
So how are you coming to that conclusion?
I was asked by the state to give Troy a psychological evaluation, and it's my expert opinion that he was not in control of his actions,
which is the definition of insanity.
See, that sounds hard to believe.
Can someone really use hypnosis to make Troy murder?
Objection.

That makes me red in the face, Your Honor.
This is not speculation but expert opinion.
You may answer the question.
Yes, it's rare.
But so is Troy.
I believe hypnotic technique forced him to attack his father and he's still not completely aware.
How?
He was at a driving range.
Post-hypnotic suggestion can be triggered at any time.
Feeling a touch on the shoulder, hearing a particular word or phrase, music...
A Red Hot Chili Peppers song, perhaps?
Sure.
Triggers can be a color, a sound, an object.
Maybe something he read.
Trigger must've been something near where Troy killed his father.
Well, brought back everyone who was here that day.
Asked them to recreate what they were doing at the time.
Including playing the same music.
Closing your eyes opens your senses.
Nice swing.

Order 17, Philly cheesesteak, fries, medium soda.
Order 17, pick up, please.
Popcorn?
No, he would have walked by that earlier.
The trigger had to be something else.
A color, a sound.
Sorry, that didn't happen before the murder.
Troy's cell phone.
We went over the call log.
Not his calls.
We need to look at his phone.
Dr. Levin's testimony swayed jurors three and eight.
What about juror nine?
Ooh, hasn't budged.
She's a visual learner.
Seeing is believing.
And now we are gonna show her the power of hypnosis.
Cable, bring up the surveillance footage from Chelsea Piers.
Why?
I know what triggered Troy to kill.
What do you think?
Well, I think it's freaky and I like it.
It allows the mind to open, unfold its truths, confront its secrets.
Now you can tell me what's really going on.
How long have you worked at TAC?
Why did Dr. Bull send you here?
We know you're working for Troy's defense team.
What exactly were you hoping to find?
Open the door.
How's Troy doing?
Yes.
I lied about why I came to Lumansic.
But everything that I told you about myself, my life, that was all true.
Don't you ever come back here.
Rachel Grey, you and your father Thornton Grey founded Lumansic, isn't that correct?
It is.
What are you hoping to get out of Rachel?
Watch and listen closely.
And what about your vision for Lumansic?
Is-Isn't it true that your father wants to keep it small but you want to expand?
You know, more money, more power, more influence.
We've had many discussions about the future.
Contentious discussions.
You had to convince him to create a second campus.
- No.

Absolutely not.
You take advantage of people, people searching for answers.
You psychologically manipulate them to your will.
- Objection.

Do you use hypnosis on your students?
Sometimes.
It's one tool of many that can help students break through.
Now, what would you think, Rachel, if I told you that simply by saying a specific word over and over... the... word "red," for example, yesterday, that it would cause everyone on the jury
to wear something red today.
You spent... two years training at the American School for Behavioral Sciences and Hypnotherapy.
Hypnosis is an amplified version of the technique that I just demonstrated.
What you just demonstrated is purely persuasion.
And hypnosis is a very powerful tool in the hands of a highly trained individual like yourself, you could persuade someone to murder.
Objection.
Withdrawn.
Could you take out your cell phone, please?
Objection.

Sustained.
We will show the phone record is relevant, Your Honor.
Rachel, could you please call Troy's phone?
No.

No?
He can't make me do that, right?
No, he can't.
But I can.
Ma'am, dial the phone.
It's okay.
Hey!
Stop.
Officers.
Get off of him.
What just happened?
I'm fine.

That was all your doing, wasn't it?
Helps you to think of me as a cult leader, doesn't it?
Makes it easier for you to send people into my house to spy on me, to destroy my life's work, to condemn my daughter as a killer.
Just as it helps you to think of your victims as students?
Makes it easier to steal their lives and call it tuition?
You should've left us alone.
Then you'd never know the truth about your daughter.
The night she called Troy to trigger him, she thought he was with you.
How's that for enlightenment?
Has the jury reached a verdict?
On the charge of murder in the second degree, we, the jury, find the defendant, Troy Dickerson, not guilty by reason of insanity.
Congratulations, Reed.
You did it.
You won your first insanity case.
How's it feel?
Pretty insane.
Any-any word on Rachel?
The police are opening a formal investigation.
It's likely she'll be charged with murder and kidnapping.
Don't tell Bull this, but I wasn't sure that the whole "red" thing would actually work.
Really?
Nice socks.
So, you were underwater?
No, I was floating.
It was actually quite peaceful.
Was the peaceful part before or after you heard the voice of the crazy cult leader who told you you were locked in the crazy pod?
You know, this thing about me being the chosen one, it got me to thinking, we both were chosen.
No, Lumansic rejected me outright.
I'm not talking about them.
I'm talking about a group of people with a fanatical commitment to a charismatic leader, a belief that his way is the only way and a complete lack of life outside of the organization.
To the Cult of Bull.
Nicely done.
Troy has a long road of recovery ahead of him.
I'll be sure he gets all the help he needs.
Thanks.
Thanks for your help with Benny.
I'm afraid I didn't get very far.
Far enough, I think.
And what about you, Jason?
How are you doing?
I'm okay.
Doctor.
I have Tuesdays at 8:00 open.
Your old slot.
I think you just want my "Better than Robert Redford," don't you?
I guess it's time I came clean?
I'm being investigated by the U.S. Attorney's office.
Nine years ago, I put a man named Hayden Watkins in prison for murder.
DNA evidence has just proven his innocence.
- You were doing your job.

The night before the trial started, I got a call from...
Long Island PD.
They'd just had a similar crime, similar M.O., thought it might be my guy.
So I just... dismissed it because I was sure that Watkins was guilty.
I put an innocent man in prison for nine years.
You know what?
That's on me.
Benny...
I was wrong.
You haven't lost faith in yourself.
I think you lost faith in me.
No, that's not true.
Yeah, it is true.
You should've come to me with this.
Solving problems is what I do.
I'm not a client.
You're more than that.
You're family.
And you're not alone.
If they come after you, they have to go through me first.
