Hurry!

Sweep!

Sweep hard!

Sweep!

Sweep!

Sweep!

Yes!
(BOTH) Yes!
Can we get a drink now?

That is rank!

Chanel No. 5?

Aye, keep it down, Kieran.
Place could be crawling with Feds.
# What's that comin' over the hill?
(ALL) # Is it a monster?

# What's that comin' over the hill?
# Is it a monster?

Did you win?

Way to go!
You managed to escape?

Hey, I'm always up for a night out.

I'll tell you why I'm doing better than you.
You've got a bigger boat.

The first thing the tourists ask:

So why are you selling it, then?
Underwater drone.
I ordered it this morning.
Of course, Annie thinks we need a new car.

So you want me to buy your sonar?
You're working Loch Ness.

If there was something down there I might think about it, but...
Leighton, maybe you just don't want to see it.
So what do you reckon?
Leighton?

I just heard him saying "I'm getting a semi-on for Mhari."
Semillon.

Oh, you're so funny!

Man about the house.
Be nice to have someone around the house to talk to.
I can hardly get a word out of my son.
Do you think he might be...
Say it.
Straight.
You're a cheeky bitch!
What about Evie?

Well, going all the way to Australia to get away from you.
That's not definite.
Jonjo... (Yelps)
How's it looking?
Er, tail needs to be longer.
Evie, look.

Jonjo...

Ssh.
I heard something.
Oh, is it the Feds?
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
(CHUCKLES)
Why did you let me drink so much?
You're off tomorrow.

Do you think Leighton fancies you?

Do you not see the way he looks at you?
How could he not fancy you?
What do you think the monster's doing now?
Well, it's nocturnal.
Probably getting ready to hunt.
(MIMICS SUDDEN GROWL) (YELPS AND LAUGHS)
Idiot!
(TEXT ALERT)
Can I grab that?
'Morning, Mum.

Morning, Mum.

I'm surprised you are.

What is it?

Come on...

Is it a boy?
Yeah, Mum, it's a boy.
Evie.
Have a good day.
(PIANO PLAYING)
(PLAYS DISCORDANT NOTE)
You're doing great, sweetheart.

(STOPS PLAYING)
I think you might be making her nervous.
Am I making you nervous, Isla?
No.
(RESUMES PLAYING)
(FALTERS)
(RESUMES)
"We peer out at the world through holes in a mask"?
Do we, Dessie?

Give me it.

Big man.

"The Shadow demands the thrill of fangs and claws, the dog within going wild after a lifetime on the leash."
Anyone?
Carl Jung.
Ah, the only student who knows is the one who's leaving halfway through her course.
So, what do we know about Carl Jung?
Mr Baxter?

Yeah.
Absolutely SFA.
(SCATTERED CHUCKLING)
OK.

I'm sorry?
There's not going to be any more music lessons.
What?

I don't need to explain myself.
Your wife promised Isla I'd be kept on.
This is a Christian household.
I don't understand.

Some of it.

We were talking about harmony.
It's filth.
And you're a hypocrite.
I taught Bethan McGrellish.
Don't worry, I won't betray a confidence.
Hey.

You call me a hypocrite and you walk away?

(PHONE RINGS)
It's Frank.

Frank.

Is it?
Put on STV news.

Residents of Lochnafoy and... ..woke to the sad news that the Loch Ness Monster is dead.
That's you fekked!
The bones of Nessie were found washed up this morning on the bonny bonny banks of the loch.
Frank?

It's a bloody health hazard.

But, Frank, what about the scientific value?
Aye, aye... (LINE GOES DEAD)
He hung up.
JOURNALIST: ..

So, Officer Denny, exactly what do you think this is behind you then?
Er, well, I'm no expert but er, I suppose it could be some kind of marine life.
A type of plesiosaur perhaps.
Er, yeah, possibly.
I mean, you can see what kind of looks like flippers.
I can see a bit of pig and cow and a seal's boabie.
Off, please.
Stop making an arse of yourself.

Er, hi.

Thanks, Kirsty Wark, I'll take it from here.
Any of youse want to help?
Didn't think so.

No more selfies.
You think this is a crime scene?
You still here?
You've taken your pictures, now please leave.
Thank you!

Yes, go!
Walk faster, please.

That's it, one foot in front of the other.

The first recorded sighting of the monster was by St Columba in AD 565.
My first sighting was at the age of 10.
I was swimming about half a mile off Foyers Point when I started getting pulled beneath the waves by a strong undertow.
I looked down, and saw this huge black shape about 20 foot long, moving beneath me.
(HORN BLASTS)
Coming up on the starboard side is a rival tour.
The owner is a non-believer, so you're invited to jeer the infidel.
Go on, give it some.

You need to see this!
'How's it looking?

Evie, look...
I've got a seal's willy bone!
I thought you'd want to know.
(BEEP)
We should be wearing masks.
For disguise?
For the smell.
Aye, right.

Annie?

We think these might be yours.

Yeah, I saw the news.
That would violate about 700 regulations.
Is Jonjo at college?
You think my son would do this?
This is not a criminal investigation.
Jonjo's had his moments but he's got his head down now.
(SIGHS)
I really don't fancy putting this back in the van.
Yeah, I nearly heaved like three times.

Would you mind?
Follow me.
Have you got a phone?
There's a man fallen here.
Annie, it's someone you know.
Oh, God.

Why do they do it?
There was a guy last week on Ben Nevis in flip-flops.
We're Mountain Rescue, not the mortuary service.
He taught Evie.
That his?
Yeah, it was next to his body.
Look, just...just leave it.
DS Redford to Control.

I recognise the deceased as...

Require full scenes of crime.
Severe head injuries.

Annie?

You think it's accidental?

Look...
That's not accidental.
We flew over in the Seahawk about half an hour ago.
What did you see?
There was nothing out of the ordinary.
It's a bad business.
So you run here from the college?
Yeah, every lunchtime.
Did you see anybody?
No, not on my run.
After I found him, I borrowed a phone from a woman.
You get her name?
Yeah.

Life extinct.
Inform the Procurator Fiscal.
Do you think someone killed him?
Suspicious death.

So how many murders have you worked?
(CHUCKLES) This is Lochnafoy.

More than ten?
None.
If you must know.
Right.
Should I go and get my sleeping bag?

You know, like, pull an all-nighter?
Jason, the body's at the mortuary.
Until we get the pathologist's results there's nothing we can do.
Oh.
What?
Niall's phone wasn't on him.

Why would he do that?
(TEXT ALERT)
How's it looking?
The tail needs to be longer.
Evie...

..a seal's willy bone!
Hey.
Did you get my message about Niall Swift?
Yeah, unbelievable.

How's madam?

Yeah, I'm a bit upset.
Evie...
I saw your wee film on YouTube.
Yeah, I've talked to her about it.
A man we all really liked is dead and you two are on about a stupid joke?
I will be on about it until you show me you've wised up.
Not what Dad said.

I never said anything.

I said it was a good day for takings.
Because of what we did.

Down to me.
Well done.
You know the worst thing about today?
Dr Marr acting like it was no big deal.
Niall taught Marr's wee girl.

Said Marr always made him feel uncomfortable.
Not the only one.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Is Kieran at home?
I'm a friend.

He's with his brother.
Can I say hi?
In you come.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
Somebody to see you, Kieran.
This is why you don't invite anyone round.
My mum told me.
Does your mum know everyone's business?

Cop thing.

Did you hear about my piano teacher?
He died.

Sorry.
Can I do something to help?
You wanna take him roller-blading?
I could trim his fingernails.
There's some scissors in the drawer there.
Jordan... ..do you mind if I tell Evie what happened?
Does he respond?

Not yet.
Stop a second.
He was a Scots Guard.
After his last tour, he had an aneurysm.
Before you moved here.
Yeah.
The doctors took ages to diagnose Locked-In Syndrome.
We had to fight to stop them turning off his life support.
He squeezed my hand.

It's just a spasm.
(MOBILE PHONE RINGING)
DCI Quigley.
Today?
Well, I've got my interview today...
OK.

Who's in charge up there?
Frank Smilie?
No.

OK.
Frank Smilie...
You're right.

Inverness, come on.
FRANK:

I always knew the bastard hated me, I just didn't know how much.
He's picked Lauren Quigley.
DCI?

English.
I was her Sergeant when she started out.
Fresh out of the box, thought she was Serpico.
(CLEARS THROAT)
I'm aware of your presence, Frank.

DS Redford, you were the first officer?

You didn't find any long metal implements at the scene, did you?
Part of the pre-frontal cortex is missing.
And judging by the blood pooled in the skull, it was removed via the nasal cavity while the victim was still alive.
Maybe his brain was hoicked out through his nose.
In broad daylight.
You've a cold-blooded predator in your town.
I'll be bringing in my own team tonight, which, given the slightly unconventional MO, will include Blake Albrighton.

Oh, I know who he is.
This your first homicide, Frank?

That's right, there was that woman up in Park Circus.
Wasn't my first.

Bollocks.
QUIGLEY:

He came to our house once a week for about three years.
To teach piano?

Liked a bit of goss.
Enough to get him killed?
It was pretty innocuous.
Did he tell you who he was sleeping with?
No.

Tight little town, gay man.

It worked fine.
Here, you contribute, you're in.
Everybody loved him.

All right?

The beauty of nature.
It bores the living shit out of me.
Craig...
Craig, what happened to you yesterday, you need to talk about it.
No, I don't.
You found a dead body.
You were white as a sheet when you came home.
Craig, please...
Look, I just need some time on my own.
Don't shut me out.
(DOOR SHUTS)
(HE LOCKS IT)
Any special significance to this area?
No.
Suicide spot?

Doggers' paradise?
It wasn't a coincidence, was it?
I'm guessing Swift and our man arranged to be here.
Have you got his phone?

Who found him?

Head of Lochnafoy College.
OK, we'll make Petrie a priority.
Any other locals I should know about?
One.

Leighton Thomas.
So, he ties him down, a fit and able-bodied man.
Does the trick with the brain.
Heaves him off the cliff, all in broad daylight.
Talk about high-risk.
The grass there...
Deer do that?

Thank you.
Local paper.

Extend the cordon to take in the whole area.

Yes, ma'am.

Hide?
Mountain Rescue flew over just before the body was found.
I found something on Carn Mhor.
I can't say what, but the SIO wants me to be part of the team.
Annie, you're talking about somebody we both knew.
Yeah.
All I'm saying is, the SIO's bringing in Blake Albrighton.
Who?

You read his book.

Forensic psychologist.
He caught the Queensferry killer, the crossbow guy in Bordeaux.
Oh, yeah.

Come on, an hour or two.

(MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO)
New people.

Oh, very good.

Can we have a word?
What's happened?
That was among the crap found on the beach.
What you have here is a human heart.
Something's had a wee chew at it.
It's gamey.
I'd estimate it was removed a week to ten days ago.
Brains, hearts...
What next, Annie?
PC Denny had the area around the bones cordoned off.
It was my decision to incinerate all foreign material on the shore.
He said he didn't mention the heart in case he got a bollocking.
I'm sorry he felt like that.
And the pranksters?
John Joseph Patterson, Kieran Whitehead, Evelyn Redford?
My daughter.
Have you any idea how bad this looks?
Have you disinfected that?

It stinks.
Do it again.
Frank.
I'm guessing this ain't good.
Is that the van they used to get the stuff to the beach?
Yeah.
Jonjo, son.

I'd give my right ball for a cup of tea.
OK.
The heart you brought in...
Human.

Over 50, apparently.
Not yours?

If you could keep that to yourself for now.
We're going to have to talk to Jonjo and you can expect a visit from the Inverness SOCOs.
Oh, what?

Get everything above board.
It's not that.

My margins are practically zero as it is.
I'll talk to them.

I should've burned the thing.
Blake.
Why did nobody tell me about all this?

Balls bigger than mine.

Glad you're here.

I'm stood there thinking, "Have these eejits not seen the uniform?"
One of them's shouting, "We'll have to let Sam drive!

(CHUCKLES) That's a stoater.
He's here, sir.

OK.
Er, the forensic psychologist...?
Jason, I know who he is.

Have you read his book?

That stuff about his sister.
Imagine carrying that around with you.
I bet he's got the next one all planned.
How I Caught The Loch Ness Monster.
(CHUCKLES)
(RINGING TONE)
ALAN:

Alan, can you bring Evie down to the station, please?
I can't OK a press conference.
We don't know what we're dealing with.
We're dealing with someone who's killed twice and will kill again.
The heart could've come from a medical school or a grave.
The same day a body is found with part of its brain removed, a heart turns up and you think that's, what, bad luck?
I don't believe in luck.

I believe in evidence.

Who's SIO?

I run everything else, which would include a press conference.
Why do you think he'll kill again?

Oh, it's a "he".

His narrative's about how clever he is.

We all need power.

The thing with the brain, he's overdoing it.
More than power, he needs to be admired.
And you hold a press conference to tell him how much you admire him?
Look, I'm talking about saving lives, OK?
By giving him what he craves, we satiate him for a while.
Maybe long enough to give us an advantage.
And you get what you crave.

Publicity.
He turned down a job in Boston to be here.

I've seen his fee.

Wait!
Chill.

Wanna come?
No, Blake, I don't.
Niall Swift, 32 years old.
Moved to Lochnafoy four years ago.
Taught local kids piano, started a choir.
Organised performances for charity.
No close attachments or relatives that we know of.
Threading together the available pathology and forensics,
Niall Swift met his killer on Carn Mhor.
His wrists were bound with a rope similar to this.
Who stocks it locally?
Do they remember anyone buying it?
Billion dollar question:

For the officer who brings me a lead, I've put something aside at the Oxfam Shop.
ALL:

And if that wasn't enough, we've had this thrown into the mix.
A little gift left on the beach.
Until we find out otherwise, we'll treat that as a separate murder investigation.
I don't know.
We all seemed to come up with the idea together.
I think I'd have to credit Evie with that.
It was Evie's idea.

Mr Petrie says you should always follow your instincts.
It was horrible.
Kieran and Jonjo were just dumping it.
There could've been a heart there.

If we'd seen a heart, we'd have been arguing about where it should go.
I think I would've remembered a heart.
While we were laying out the bones, I had a feeling we were being watched.
You had a feeling?

Nah.
Look, I'm trying to establish how the heart got there.
If you saw someone, maybe they put it there after you'd gone.
I didn't see anyone.
Wait there.
Do you believe her?
Yeah.
Am I off the case?
I'm going to let her go, but I strongly recommend she does not leave the area.
Right.

What are you at this moment?

You're compromised.

(TV ON) (DOOR OPENS)
Are you off the case?

Where'd the heart come from?
What's the deal with the heart?

Shit.
Nobody knows about that, so don't go blabbing.

We never saw any heart.

Do you know some medical student?
Annie, you're not on the job now.

She's pissed cos she messed up.

Where'd you get it?

Do you?

Evie!
(DOOR SHUTS)
(LOW VOICES)
Mr McGrellish, just let me give you something...
I don't want any help.

Why won't you let me contribute at least?
Evie.
I'd better go.
Hi.
Sad day.

I mean, who could do a thing like that?
Have you called Bethan?

Oh, Bethan was in bits.
I've been messaging her.
She hasn't had a minute to herself.
Law degrees don't come free with the Bunty.
Hey.
The new DCI needs you to check in down at the station.
I can't stay here.
Course you can.
The community needs you.
What, you think this is a community?
It's a bunch of people drawn together by lies.
(SIGHS)
CRAIG:

BLAKE:

Are you on the investigation team?

I committed murder.

You got a taste for it?

Oh, for fuck's sake.

We might be looking at another victim.
If we can get that enhanced, we could have the killer's handwriting.
What's going on?

Now, most people, their monsters are in here.
Scratching to get out.
