We should touch down in just a few minutes.
Whoa.
So, that's what my mom's thoughts look like.
They look good.
I think.
Hold on.
Whoa.
That's her?
She looks nice.
[ Beeping ]
We're here, Finn.
Humans.
There's so many.
[ Chuckles ] Don't worry, you're gonna fit right in.
Hey, listen.
I remember enough about my old life to know that there were some dangerous people here.
So let's stick together, okay?
And let's all try to keep a low profile.
Hey, you, where's Minerva?
You scared me with that costume, citizen.
And does she have any chips or crackers or anything?
I'm getting real tired of picking batteries out of these BMO cakes.
Where's Minerva?
Man, that's a pretty weird question.
Minerva's everywhere.
Additionally, everyone knows that.
Just look around for somebody who needs help, and Minerva will be there helping, obviously.
"Where's Minerva?" [ Chuckles ]
You hear that, man?
Minerva's into helping people, just like you.
She must've gave you her helper genes as DNA up in her womb with your placenta.
DN-what-what?
Mister?
Can I rub the dog's tummy, mister?
He's got a cute yellow tummy.
Shoot, kid, you don't even have to ask.
Just scooch right up and get busy.
[ Gasps ] You're a talking dog!
Teesa, Meeka, Gee-gee, come look!
A talking dog!
Are they gonna help with the tummy rub?
[ Kids giggling ] Finn, look.
Oh, Geez.
I didn't think we would find her do fast.
We can come with you if you'd like.
Nope.
Finn only.
Hello, young man.
Is there anything I can help you with?
[ Breathes deeply ] This is gonna sound weird, but... and I don't mean to put you on the spot.
But, uh... did you... did you lose... a son?
Careful, citizens.
Litter can be unattractive, but dangerous, as well.
Is there anything I can help you with?
This is going a lot different than I pictured it.
Are you telling me none of you has ever seen a talking dog before?
That's crazy.
That's even crazier than the old lady who lives alone on that weather island.
[ Laughter ]
[ Laughs ]
No, but seriously, if you think this is impressive, you should've seen me at the Flea Circus.
I really stole the show.
[ Laughter ]
[ Chuckles ] Nah, but seriously,
Y'all should really meet my friend BMO.
Now's not the time.
Now there's a friend you can really...
[ Laughter ]
Frieda.
Wow, listen, you guys are great.
I got to get going and find my friends, but man, what a great crowd, though, seriously.
One more joke.
[ Cheering ]
That's all I got.
I don't know any more jokes.
Wait, wait.
I can do other stuff besides jokes.
Like, um, oh.
[ Inhales deeply ]
Pbbbbbbbbbt!
Huh?
I'm just a regular dog, see?
[ Pants ] [ Gasps ]
Minerva!
Oh, are you in shock?
Do you need help?
Hey.
Oh, hey, Minerva.
Finn, I found Miner...
Uh, disregard.
You are creating a disturbance.
Please help let us help you help us to sedate you.
I'm not a mutant.
Although, now that you men...
[ Groans ]
And I'm your suhhh...
Son!
You can't get them off.
I tried a lot already.
I love you, but your mom's a hundred robo-clones.
Those things aren't my mom.
Maybe they look like my mom because they did something to her, right?
I'm going to get out of here and I'm going to rescue her, and I'll hug her, and... and...
I've had weirder fights than this.
Where da bones?
Thas muh hand.
[ Whirs ]
[ Gasps ]
[ Both gasp ]
[ Horns honking ]
Uh...
Are you going to buy me a toy?
No.
Well, maybe.
I have to talk to my friend first.
Mm-hmm.
I made a mistake a long time ago.
My friend got hurt.
I don't know if I'm allowed back in her life.
Mm-hmm.
Where are we going, man?
[ Splashing ]
What is this?
Am I dreaming?
Who are you?
It is you.
Oh my gosh, I can't believe you're alive!
Minerva-bot, hug my son.
You're beautiful.
[ Laughs ] My boy, baby Finn!
Oh, you're so big.
Last time I saw you, you were 6.875 kilograms, and now look at you!
Mom...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm babbling.
Yes, darling?
What happened to you?
You've been gone for so long.
When you and Martin disappeared,
I was left fragile as an eggshell.
Martin is a hider.
He left with our baby.
Dr. Gross was resolute.
She immediately activated her most powerful seeker to bring you back.
But years went by.
You and your father were never coming back.
Dark days grew darker.
I went into myself, and while I retreated,
Dr. Gross's work turned strange and dangerous.
Aroo?
Dr. Gross's actions unwittingly led to the release of a terrible virus.
[ Glass shatters ]
It was the most catastrophic event that had happened to our species in 300 years.
We tried to consolidate and quarantine everyone on Founders Island.
The fatality rate in the general population grew to 62%.
But the fatality rate in helpers, those who faced the virus daily, was 100%.
Or nearly.
I was only one helper and in no condition to do my job.
[ Coughs ]
I made my decision.
With my brain-map uploaded to the Web,
I could be hundreds of helpers.
And humanity needed help above all else.
Since that day, I have protected and cared for all my people the best I could.
[ Sniffles ]
But that all doesn't matter anymore.
You're back!
And now you can live here in safety.
Oh, but I can't necessarily...
For the rest of your life.
*ADVENTURE TIME* Season 08 Episode 14 "Islands Part-8 The Light Cloud"
Synchronized by srjanapala
I'm leaving my mom.
What a wild adventure, yellow stretching dog.
You said it, beautiful baby boy.
The Guardian!
Oh, no!
We never should've left the island!
Now we die!
By my calculations, you stand a 0.00001% chance of making it past the Guardian.
Can't you just turn him off?
He's here for our protection.
If we were tough enough to make it past him, we wouldn't need him!
But...
But none of that matters, because you can stay safe right here with me!
Minerva Bot, hug my son again.
Mom, listen, I'm so happy I finally got to meet you and learn about humans.
But I have to get back to my life eventually.
Let's watch it again.
[ Tape rewinding ]
[ Indistinct conversations, laughter ]
[ Bells jingle ]
Be right with you.
Ugh.
Hi, Frieda.
Hope you didn't come to get the soup!
I, um, I wanted to apologize for everything.
I know you can't ever forgive me, but I am truly sorry.
Don't sweat it.
Awkward feelings averted.
Let's have some soup!
And who's this little electronic cutie?
What happened to you?
I grew up, and I learned to accept the Founders' truth.
Frieda.
The outside world's really cool.
I have cool friends.
Yeah!
I live in a cool tree house.
Yeah!
That sounds dangerous!
No!
But people need danger in order to grow.
How will y'all survive when you leave the island?
Leaving the island would destroy us.
Besides, why would they want to leave?
We have everything you could need.
You hungry?
[ Snaps fingers ] Always.
Minerva Bot, please show him today's specials.
Gimme all them specials in one bowl.
[ Munching loudly ]
Jake!
I'm so glad you like it.
[ Munching continues ]
If you're not gonna hear what I'm saying, then look inside my head!
Danger zone!
[ Zap ]
Finn!
I'm okay.
Sweet remembrances, bro.
Your world seems so chaotic.
Your ruler's a piece of gum, your friend's a vampire, you dated a bit of fire.
Your life is constantly in danger!
As your mother, I think you belong somewhere safe.
It's not your responsibility to fight monsters all the time.
Minerva Bot 5, ready the cloud chamber.
Now, be a good boy and get into this machine so it can juice up your precious essence.
[ Gasps ]
Pftttt!
[ Munching ]
[ Sighs ]
Mom, not only am I not getting juiced,
I'm gonna leave this place and take everyone to freedom!
Okay, sweetie, but I think you'll find everyone's pretty happy here.
Don't you remember your dreams of exploration?
If I remember, I might get... angry.
Uh, excuse me.
[ High-pitched scream ]
[ Conversations stop ]
I know y'all like living on this tiny island 'cause it's safe and chill, but you don't have to live like this.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
Wait!
You think the outside world is scary?
Well, you know what's really scary?
Bees!
Crowds!
Ngyuhhh!
No.
Letting fear make all your decisions for you.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
Follow me!
Don't you want to be able to choose what you do?
And where you go?
Yeah, but it's also fun.
Life's never just one thing.
Yeah.
We got freedom smushed up inside our guts.
We want to explore and have experiences and learn new things.
Kingdoms made of candy, beautiful dragons, fire-breathing princesses, incredibly sad wizards...
It's all waiting for you across the ocean.
So misguided.
Hey, this guy is great!
What are we hanging around here for?
I did want to leave the island when I was younger, but...
[ Crowd cheering ] They're actually listening to him.
All aboard!
[ Cheering continues ]
[ Feedback ] Patch me in to all Minerva Bots.
Attention!
For your protection, the entire population of the islands will now be uploaded.
Once the field has reached peak saturation,
Say goodbye to your meat bodies!
[ Crowd whimpering ]
Mom!
[ Whimpering continues ]
Stop!
Your cloud is freaking us all out!
Sweetie, you forced my hand.
This is the only way I can protect you.
You're only doing this because I said I wouldn't stay.
So I'll stay.
Just promise to stop messing with people.
I'm helping people.
I know about helping people.
[ Zap ]
Finn, you... you grew up to be a helper, too?
If your world taught you to behave like that, maybe it's not all bad.
[ All screaming ]
Perhaps I acted rashly.
I just didn't want to lose you again.
But I'll do everything I can to help you leave this island.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
Ahoy!
Now boarding the historic voyage of the humans back to the land of Ooo!
Oh, you mean right now?
I thought you meant, like, in a while.
I've still got some things to finish up.
We should definitely keep in touch, though.
[ Crowd murmuring ]
You can't teach a fish to dance overnight, son.
Well, as long as they got the option.
Ready, Frieda?
Ready.
[ Boat horn blows ]
I'm leaving my mom.
What a wild adventure, yellow stretching dog.
You said it, beautiful baby boy.
Oh, yeah.
You got fooled by Frieda!
Hey, buddy.
Aaah!
Yaaaaaah...
Aaaaaah...
Aaaaaah!
Aaaaaah!
Huh?
Patching her in now.
Guardian, you have done just a terrific job, but it's time to stand down.
[ Boat horn blows ]
When do I fire the torpedoes?
Kara, you ready to go?
Actually, I think we're headed in a different direction.
Time for new memories.
So, where are we going, Kara?
I've been thinking...
I kind of like "Susan" better.
Okay, Susan.
It wa.
Take care of yourself in Ooo.
Be careful when you're eating blueberries.
Too many can hurt your tummy.
Your ship is moving out of range.
Is this... really you?
Once you uploaded your brain and stuff, like, are you still the same person?
I don't know for sure, but I feel like it's me.
I hope that's enough.
Goodbye.
