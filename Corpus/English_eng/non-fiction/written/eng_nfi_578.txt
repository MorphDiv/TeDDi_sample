Go!

Somebody's been ignoring the Please Don't Feed the Beast signs, and it's dinnertime again!
Right now, the epic war of man versus machine rages on, and I'm not referring to Terry Crews on an elliptical machine.
Hello, everyone, I'm Charissa Thompson, and welcome to Ultimate Beastmaster.
And I'm Terry Crews.
And Charissa, you should see me on an elliptical.
- I'm like...

Very similar to how the Beast has been able to dominate dozens of competitors up and to this point, but that has not scared away 12 warriors that showed up in the mountains here in California to charge into the jaws of the Beast
in hopes to find fame, fortune, and glory.
Let's quickly meet our two competitors representing the USA tonight.
First, starting down south, ready to enter the jaws of the mighty Beast, we've got Steven Tucker from Arlington, Texas.
This rock-climbing veteran and single father believes his unassuming strength and off-the-charts agility will help power him to a victory.
I want to win extremely badly.
If my son saw me win, he would never stop talking about it.
He always wants to be active.
This would inspire him and help him stay on that path.
I'm maybe a little bit of an underdog.
People aren't going to look at me as "this guy is extremely strong,"
but I think I'll surprise a lot of people.

Out west is Ryan Scott from Dublin, California, and don't let the job fool you, this financial advisor is a calisthenics junkie.
His speed and agility give him all the tools he needs to defeat the Beast.
What makes me unique in this competition is that I only train with my body weight.
I have a gym in my backyard, which is all calisthenics-based:
pull-up bars, dip bars, push-up bars.
I built the bars in my backyard because I wanted to spend more time with my son.
I'm a very present and dedicated husband and father, and that means a lot to me.
I do feel ready to take on the Beast.
Steven Tucker and Ryan Scott:
these devoted dads will both give it everything they've got as they compete to become the Ultimate Beastmaster.
You know how the game works, and if you don't, well, go back to the first few episodes.
So, here we go.
You start with Level 1, and our first competitor of the night, Maki Morishima.
She has got a rather unorthodox athletic background.
I'm a pole dancer, but also a fighter.
I'll give it all I've got.
She's used to dancing with a pole, but tonight she's dancing with the Beast.
On to our brand-new obstacle, and this one could really choke up our competitors.
It's Throat Erosion, where she'll have to bounce on an industrial trampoline and reach a rope lever 13 feet in the air to release a climbing wall.
The key is finding the sweet spot on that trampoline to propel yourself higher.
She's 5'1", so she has to get massive air here.
Oh!
She only has five tries.
After five misses, her run is done.
- You have to also stay focused.

She has it, and she lets go.

Yes, got it!
- And now she's on to Faceplant.

- Look how tired she is.

That right there is the spirit of a true athlete.
She's got it!
That was close!

She keeps her grip!
- Maki fights on.

- She's got this.

Look at her!

Leaping from Energy Coil with ease.
No!
- She couldn't reach it.

- Good job!

Take another look.

That is an incredible display of athleticism, and that's... that's what pole dancing can do for you.
I was able to get one.

Let's take a quick look at how our next four competitors fare.
First up was Kerstin Schöessler, and after five attempts, our new obstacle,
Throat Erosion, swallowed her chances of success, and she was disqualified.
Kyoung Duck Kang, a personal trainer from Korea... roared into battle with the Beast, but the desire to win was squashed by Faceplant.
No!
Should've grabbed!
Hiroyuki Tanaka, a tech consultant from Japan, was psyched to make it past Jaw Breaker.
- Oh, he got it!

- Hold on!

Got to find a way to get back up.
-  Oh, come on!

- Oh, no!

Then there was Fernando Casanova, an extreme endurance racer from Mexico.
I do them because I like to learn from my body.
I like to find out where I can take it.
Fernando pushed his limits on Faceplant...
To the Coil, please!
He hangs there with all the calluses from his training.
Fer!

He was going for the bonus.

Come on!
And ended up plunging into the blood of the Beast.
He let himself fall.
Go, Mexico!
Now we'll see how he's doing against the others.
- What do you think?

He's number one!

- You're the greatest, man.

That's right, guys.

Next up is South Korean stuntman extraordinaire, Taeyoung Lee.
My name is Taeyoung Lee.
I'm a stunt coordinator and director for movies and TV shows.
About six months ago...

There was an injury.
Even after a surgery, I can't really see with this eye.
Oh, what an incredible story!
With this guy's skill, Throat Erosion should be a piece of cake.
I don't know, it's looking like he's having trouble.
- Oh!

Taeyoung Lee is on his way to Faceplant right after he ascends this wall.
This is a guy who spends his days dodging explosions.
He seems a little worried by the Beast.
- He's got it!

- He's got it.

- Yes!

Oh, you know this has to be so much more difficult for him, being blind in one eye!
It's insane what he's able to do.
Ohh!

He scored!
And he gets the Point Thruster!
But now he's on an island...
No!
He just fell off there.

Oh!
It looks like he's all right.
- He seems to be fine.

A little dazed, but with that bonus,
Tae comes away with 40 points, and he cruises into first place.
Well, Ryan Scott from the USA will be the next competitor to take a shot at the Coils.
He's a perfectionist when it comes to his workouts.
My workouts are typically 500 to 1,000 reps.
To some people, they think that's crazy.
To me, that's a good workout.
And here's another good workout.
Boom!

He's moving on with another 10 points.
He is on Faceplant.
He has got to get up and out onto this rope.
Here we go.
- And he goes, and he gets the elevation!

Nice job!
Yeah, good job!
USA!

- Whoo!

Incredible.

Made that jump with room to spare.
I thought he would have gone for the bonus, but he's playing it safe.
Doing good, Ryan!
He's a good-looking, determined man.
He loves his country, and luckily...
- No!

No, no, no!
Ryan!
He had the distance, but his right foot slipped off the platform.
Oh, no, so another run ends on the Coils and Ryan Scott of the US lands in second behind Taeyoung Lee of South Korea.
You know he's not happy with that result, Terry.
Up next is Brazilian Marcel Scarpim, who's driven by more than just the competition.
An event in my life made me a stronger person, the loss of my grandpa.

Continuing my life, knowing he wasn't there, made me a stronger person.
I keep up with my choices today remembering the grandson he believed Marcel would be.
I don't think I've let him down.
So, Marcel has some big-time motivation in his cells as he faces the Energy Coils.
He's got two more to go.
He managed to hold on!
- He did it again!

Whoa!
His lip is bleeding.
Yeah, he looks like he got hit.

But, you know what?

We're in this together, Marcel!
- Great job.

Now on to the Mag Wall.
He'll need a strong grip and impeccable plan of attack.
Oh, nearly a disaster, but he manages to hang on!
Oh!

So that gutsy performance locks Marcel in for the next level, along with Taeyoung Lee, Ryan Scott, and Fernando Casanova.
Marcel, you are in second place, bro.

You are already in, my man.
That's it, Brazil.

Brazil!
So, let's take a look at our next three competitors.
Emmanuel Chiang, a bodybuilder from Mexico, was pumped up to take on the Beast.
My strategy?

Taking it easy, I'll try to get the donuts extra point.
He muscled through Throat Erosion and Faceplant.
But when he went through the Point Thruster... he ran out of juice and ended up plunging headfirst into the blood of the Beast.
Are you ready for this?

Next up was professional model Joel Pusitzky from Germany.
And he looks a bit like Sideshow Bob.
Absolutely.

Joel put together a cocky and dominant performance on Level 1, making it closer to the end than anyone else so far tonight.
But the Mag Wall took this model out, as well.
The great thing is, after this competition is over, we can use his head to clean up everything because he is wearing a mop.
Great!
Everything for Germany!
And Steven Tucker from the USA.
I'm a rock climber.

And hang on he did at Faceplant.
- Focus on the chain.

- Focus on the chain!

That's it, Steven!

but got rocked by the Energy Coils.
Oh!
I didn't realize the whole thing was going to move.
When you jump off one, the other one moves as well.
As soon as I jumped, that thing shifted to the side.
I knew I was going to miss it, but hopefully it's good enough.
With those three runs, Joel, Steven, and Emmanuel all get their tickets punched for Level 2, but Kyoung Duck Kang, Hiroyuki Tanaka, and Kerstin Schöessler have all been knocked out of the competition.
Maki Morishima is now on the bubble, and only one woman can ruin her night.
Brazilian circus performer Carol Valim.
I think the circus is a modality that works the body in general.
When I was introduced to the circus, I found myself again.
You are looking at the winner.
Two women with similar skill sets battle it out for a spot in the next round.
Maki scored 30 points on Level 1, and Carol sits at ten as she begins to bounce on Throat Erosion.
And getting massive air.

Maki Morishima must feel Carol creeping up on her as she scales the wall on her way to Faceplant.
And right now, if she makes this jump to Faceplant,
Maki is out of this competition.
It all comes down to this!
It's Japan versus Brazil.
- Oh!

No!

Let's see where it went wrong for Carol Valim.
She jumps straight out and down, and could not recover.
So, that's how Level 1 ends.
Maki Morishima just squeaks into Level 2.
One player to pay attention to in Level 2 is stuntman Taeyoung Lee of South Korea, who finished Level 1 in first place, despite a visual impairment.
Another one to watch is Brazilian Marcel Scarpim.
He injured his face mid-run and still came out on top of Americans
Ryan Scott and Steven Tucker.
I expect the three to be butting heads big-time in Level 2.
On to Level 2, where our eight remaining competitors will take on six extraordinarily challenging obstacles, all worth 20 points each.
The Beast doesn't have this name by chance.
It seems to be fun to conquer, and very difficult.
I have some abrasions on my shins, but nothing that's going to slow me down.
I'm a bit nervous.
I have no idea what to expect.
I do my best for Germany.
I got this.
Go, Mexico!
All right, we are starting Level 2 with Spinal Descent, and tonight we've ramped it up with an extra 20 pounds of pressure on those cables, which will make finding your way through even more difficult.
First to take on the challenge is bodybuilder Emmanuel Chiang from Mexico.
No, no pressure, just excitement.
This level's going to be good, no?
What motivates me to win, and I know I will, is my family.
My dad used to compete as a bodybuilder.
I always admired him a lot.
He died when I was 11.
I try hard to be as good as he was, or even better.
Emmanuel scored 30 points on Level 1, and he'll look to add to that here on Spinal Descent.
He's a big guy, 6'1" and almost 210 pounds, but I think his size might be helping him push through the extra tension on those cables.
He's got it!
- Way to go!

Well done, Emmanuel.
Whoa, and he is fired up!
Yeah, the Beast will do that to you.
- It brings out that aggressive side.

He'son!

Wow, we can see how his bodybuilding experience gives him superior control over his movements on these obstacles.
Big jump!
Whoa, that was almost a disaster as he turns his attention to Digestive Track!
In he goes, and that's a tight fit for this bodybuilder.
Emmanuel!
We know the key to Digestive Track is fast, fast, fast, so you can get above at a great angle to jump down.
You've got to get your footing and jump.
- Onto the tread...

- No!

That's where I think his weight hurt him.
Yes, yes.

He made it all the way to the Dreadmills, but botched the landing.
I'm too big, I got stuck on my way out of the tube.
I'm a bit tired.
A lot of adrenaline, eh?

Next up, pole-dancing Maki Morishima, the last remaining Japanese athlete.
She started this level with the fewest points, and remember, only the players with the top five scores will move on to the next level.
Going for that Point Thruster would be a step in the right direction if she can get there because she is so little and light that she's much higher up there than we're used to seeing at this point.
Look at her, she's going for it.

Good call.

Oh, no!

Yes, got it!
On to Stomach Churn, and Maki's size can once again make this extra difficult, because she's barely five feet tall, and the jump to that gear is eight feet up and out.
Oh!
Oh, no!

Maki didn't have the power in her legs to make that jump.
Her upper-body strength couldn't save her this time.
Back at the start of the course,
Mexico's Fernando Casanova is readying himself for Level 2, and let's find out what turned this endurance racer's life around.
In high school, I weighed 225 pounds.
The doctor told me to change my habits or I wouldn't live to be 30.
First, I started with a nutritionist and lost the weight.
Then I continued on my own, but it's been a process of trial and error.
I came here ready to defeat the Beast.
I'll be the Ultimate Beastmaster!
Wow, aggressive move from Fernando there!
Clearly looking to get fellow Mexican, Emmanuel, at the top of the leader board, going for that Point Thruster now.
He got it.

Congratulations!

- Twenty points in!

Quickly to his feet, and look at that!
Keeping his feet moving so he doesn't get dizzy!
Now quiets his feet as he gets ready to jump.
Ooh!
Now set to take on Digestive Track, and this is where fellow Mexican, Emmanuel, ran into some trouble.
Oh, no!

- Fernando Casanova!

Oh, no!
Into the blood of the Beast!
Into the blood of the Beast!
Aw... ay!
A small mistake on the entry to that tube, and he could not recover.
Digestive Track is a killer.
I lost those extra points.
Let's hope for good numbers and a pass to the third one.
Level 2 has been giving our competitors fits tonight.
Ryan Scott, our workout junkie from the USA, was the first to try and break up the Mexican logjam at the top of the leader board.
He ripped through Spinal Descent, flew across Stomach Churn...
USA!

and blasted past Digestive Track.
But the Beast slowed him down with a huge hit on the Dreadmills.
He took a really tough hit.
The last remaining Brazilian, Marcel Scarpim, made quick work of Spinal Descent and Stomach Churn.
Marcel!
Does he have the energy to make it?
And after tearing through Digestive Track... he came up short on his escape to the Dreadmills.
He was taking too long, man.
He was taking too long.
But a look at the leader board shows that Marcel and Ryan's runs were good enough to land them in first and second place, and Ryan Scott can't figure out a way to get past this tenacious Brazilian.
Japanese pole dancer Maki Morishima falls to the brink of elimination, and she's gonna need some help from the other competitors if she hopes to move on.
Let's catch up with Joel Pusitzky.
He's looking to send Maki Morishima home.
She escaped elimination once.

If Joel lands on Stomach Churn, he'll have the points to eliminate Maki and Japan from the game.
Going for the Point Thruster.
He's got it.
Well, he's got the Point Thruster, but that won't matter if he can't navigate back to the platform.
Whoa, he is really shaky up there, barely holding on.
Germany!

Disaster averted for Joel!
And Maki and Japan are out of the competition.
Yeah, take a break, brother!

- He is celebrating himself.

One thing he has to remember is the rotation.
The longer he rests, the worse it's gonna get for him.
- Oh, he's dizzy.

- I'm dizzy watching him.

Does he know that this is Ultimate Beastmaster?
Joel Pusitzky, I think we'll close up and just leave him on the platform.
Oh!
Joel Pusitzky, this will not be enough, but this is for you, brother.
He took his time, and that was a big mistake.
This course is hard enough without making yourself dizzy.
Joel Pusitzky does just enough to keep himself and Germany in the game, but he's on the bubble.
That's not a good place to be with Taeyoung Lee of South Korea up next.
He finished Level 1 in first place, despite being blind in one eye.
He comes in with 40 points.
Joel sits in fifth place with 80.
If Tae can get past Stomach Churn, he'll send Joel home.
Got it!
- Yes!

Fast 40 points there puts Tae and Joel in a tie!
He desperately needs the points for this obstacle to make sure he sends Joel home.
It's the last Korean in the competition versus the last German, with a spot in Level 3 on the line.
Exactly where Joel fell, and Tae is slowing down here, too.
And he looks disoriented.
And so he's having a hard time figuring it out.
- Oh!

Taeyoung Lee falls, so he and Joel are tied, but Taeyoung Lee did it faster, so that means Tae is still alive.
Oh...
It's way more difficult than Level 1.
Joel Pusitzky is eliminated, and Germany is out of the competition.
Taeyoung Lee finds himself on the bubble.
So, will it be the USA or South Korea claiming that final spot in Level 3?
And it all comes down to Steven Tucker, the rock-climbing instructor from the USA, and as we found out earlier, this single dad is motivated to win by the love of his son.
I have a six-year-old son, his name's Tristan.
Basically a miniature version of me.
He loves rock climbing and doing obstacles with me.
So, I want to win it for him and, of course, for the United States.
I'm Steven, and I will be the Ultimate Beastmaster.
Steven starts his run with 30 points.
Eighty is the score to beat.
Down into Spinal Descent!
Wow, he's falling down Spinal Descent.
Rolls into it.
Eyeing that Point Thruster.
He's got it!

And there's Korea's Taeyoung Lee looking on.
His fate lies in the hands of Steven Tucker right now.
You got it.
Yeah, there you are!
He fell on a jump through the last Energy Coil on Level 1, and he can't have the same result here.
If he falls, he's out, and Taeyoung Lee moves on.
USA!

♪ Way to go, Korea ♪
-  He got it!

And Korea is out.
The USA has put its second player into Level 3.
Digestive Track, no one's made that leap tonight.
- The angle...

- Yes!

Come on, Steven, come on!
And it's awesome!

Whoo!
- Good job, Steven.

Well-earned rest.
On to Chain Reaction, and no competitor has even touched this obstacle.
Steven Tucker has passed everyone, and he's not done yet.
Oh, and into the blood!
I don't know, but I think he touched Vertebrace.
If he did, that's 20 more points.
And, oh, yeah!

I'm not bleeding anywhere this time.
I'm wet.

Steven Tucker rockets into first place.
Behind him, Brazil's Marcel Scarpim, and fellow American, Ryan Scott.
Rounding out the pack are Emmanuel Chiang and Fernando Casanova of Mexico.
Five competitors, all ready to take on Level 3.
We've got Brazil's Marcel Scarpim, and he's joined by a double dose of Americans.
I think I have the upper-body strength for Level 3, right up my alley.
Hopefully my grip strength holds me all the way through to Level 4.
A lot of the other athletes are like super athletes.
They look past me because I'm kind of a normal guy, but I think they're gonna be surprised.
Also vying for that grand prize are two compadres from Mexico.
I'm excited to be with another Mexican.
And what a Mexican, right?

To be with this youngster, a brutal baby...
- Yeah, baby, right.

- We'll win this.

A Mexican final.
This is crazy.
We could have an all-Mexican or all-American final round, depending on what happens right now.
Go, Mexico!
First up is single dad, mountain-climbing instructor Steven Tucker.
Here we go!
Don't run backwards.

Just get on there and run forward.
Oh, no, he's doing it.

Get some speed.
He's got it!

And you can see him slipping right there.
It's very difficult to keep your balance on those metal rods, even for someone with the sure footing of a climber.
Come on, Steven.
Come on, Steven.
Look at that thing sinking down.
He's going down.

You got no choice.

No, there's no way...

He's gotta get above the fuel.
- Oh, man.

- Oh, no.

It's over.

So, American Steven Tucker finishes with 210 points, an okay start, but you know he wanted more.
I wish I would've gone quicker down the ring.
It was more wobbly than I thought, and too high to grab the next one.
Up next, financial advisor Ryan Scott of the USA.
Don't do that little run on the treadmill.

Oh, no, he's doing it.
Okay, run.

Oh!
I tell you, I hate the run-jog thing.
Look at the replay.

Ugh.

Ah, I wasn't focused enough.
Up next, endurance racer Fernando Casanova from Mexico.
And although he and countryman Emmanuel Chiang finished Level 1 at the bottom of the leader board, they are both feeling confident.
Mexico!

Mexico!
Oh, he's doing the nice little jog on the treadmill before you get ejected!
What was that, brother?
- Such a warm-up, and then suddenly...

Let me tell you something, that swag move never works.
Watch this.

This is the opposite of a Jordan jump.
Boom!
So, Fernando comes up empty on Level 3.
His 90 points leave him in third place, so he has been eliminated.
With the hopes of an all-Mexican final squashed, it all rests on Emmanuel's shoulders now to represent his country in Level 4.
Okay.

You have to run up the ramp.
- Jump, come on!

Emmanuel...
Just like that, Ryan Scott is out.
He got the Point Thruster!
He did grab it, he saw it!
He's got the Point Thruster as he moves over into Coil Crawl!
The big man from Mexico ends the threat of an all-American Level 4.
The coils, whoa, those things are sinking fast.
Remember, Emmanuel's our biggest and heaviest competitor.
He's gotta go.
Yeah, he's got it.

Right now he's gone right, which means he's going to stay the course...
- He's making a move.

Is he going to go into the bonus?
Bonuses are worth 40 points, but if he falls here, he loses 40, so it's a huge risk.
Come on, Mexico!
Emmanuel Chiang, let me tell you, he's a big guy, and I'm a little nervous about the Bungee Beds.
There's another 30 points, and that puts him in first place.
He can pull further ahead if he does well here on the Bungee Beds.
There you go.
Any part of his body hits the platform or the water, he's out.
Now, you can use these elastic bands that the Bungee Beds are suspended from to aid you.
So you can reach up and grab them from the second bed there, sort of pull it down.
I say you grab the bed, bring it to you.
There's no reason to jump over there.
Oh!

- Nice.

It's like being on a raft in the middle of the ocean.
All right, he's on all fours deciding.
Yeah, well, that's a leap!
If you try to jump here, he's gonna be...
There you go.

- Come on, Emmanuel!

He pulled his legs up so they wouldn't hit the floor and he just completed it!

Well done!
Emmanuel, yeah!
Well done for Emmanuel Chiang.
Excellent job.
Why did I stop?

I barely did the trapeze, I didn't want to risk it.
I'm happy with what I did.
Go, Mexico!
Well, it won't be an all-Mexican final.
Right now, American Steven Tucker sits in second place, but Brazil's Marcel Scarpim will have the final say.
It's now!
- This is our...

- At the Ejector...

Give it some space and go, run, jump!
No, no, no, no!
Man, I don't know what to tell you.
What a way to end Level 3!
Emmanuel Chiang and Steven Tucker have the highest point totals and will be headed to the final level.
Before the action starts, let's check in with our two finalists.
I'm not having any doubts.
I'm going to go and give it my all.
Strength, to me, is what you can do with your body, not necessarily how it looks.
It doesn't matter what you look like if you can't do anything cool.
He's got it!
I'm a proud man, I don't like losing.
I'm winning, I'm dominating you, you'll be mine, okay?
- Go, Mexico!

You're not defeating me.
I'm representing the normal guys, the ones that don't really care about bench pressing 400 pounds.
I'll be the Ultimate Beastmaster!
USA versus Mexico in Level 4!
I will be the Ultimate Beastmaster because this is what I do every day.
This is what we've been waiting for, USA versus Mexico!
- Here we go.

- USA!

Each one of these Energy Taps are worth 10 points in Foundation.
Steven Tucker's got an advantage here.

- He's a rock climber.

Both competitors now making the transition to the second part of the power source of Grid Lock.
Grid Lock has these small cracks and very, very little room to find anywhere for your fingers and your feet to go,
- so we will see how they fare.

- Emmanuel Chiang is not out.

You can recover, but you do not want to get too far behind.
Steven Tucker's doing a nice job, finding a way to get his feet wedged in that tiny little crack.
Look at that.

We've got a race right now!
You're so close, almost there!
- My man, so close!

Trying so...

- He's got it!

He's made it out of Grid Lock...
- Oh!

USA!

- Whoo!

Come on, Mexico, come on!
Steven Tucker's got himself $10,000 if he can just maintain his position.
Five, four, three, two, one!
It's over!
Yes!

What a shame, what a shame, dear God!
- Atta baby!

- Steven Tucker is tonight's Beastmaster.

He goes home with $10,000.
He's also earned a spot in the finals and an opportunity to win $50,000 and that highly-coveted title of Ultimate Beastmaster.
I honestly didn't think that I would make it this far, and to make it to the championship, I'm super stoked.
My son, he's six years old.

I can't wait to watch with him.

I can't wait to get home and see him.

Now, if you're like me,
I'm sure you can't get enough of Ultimate Beastmaster, so there'll be 12 more competitors coming back for our next episode.
- We'll see you next time.

USA!
