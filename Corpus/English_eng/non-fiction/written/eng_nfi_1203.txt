Previously on Being Mary Jane.
Yeah, my brother's showing me a listing tomorrow afternoon.
We're not actually having this conversation now, are we?
It's way too early for us to be even thinking about this.
Well, you haven't met my kids.
Exactly.
Your mom wanted me to make sure you got in okay.
- How's everything?

This is Ava.
- AVA:

Mom didn't tell me my new babysitter would be so cute.
- Tell me what you want.

- I love you.

Judge McAlister, I'm sure you have been approached by every journalist here tonight.
Then you're aware of my reservations
- regarding interviews.

Now "Great Day USA" is friendly and relatable.
It's the perfect opportunity for the public to meet the man behind the robe.
So, when it comes down to it, when I look at you, I see an ugly Black woman, too.
Now that's... that's an ambush.
I mean, worse still, race baiting.
I mean, I think your demeanor is cold, it's judgmental, it's haughty.
I just don't think that's what our viewers want with their morning coffee.
Look, Mary Jane, we all know you have charisma and charm and that works for the lighter pieces.
It's the serious interviews.
I just don't think they're for you.

Harvard, what year?
MARY JANE:

- Birthplace?

And the name of this...
Mother, Diane, elementary school teacher, and his father, Raymond, owned a chain of supermarkets.
- And what about the oldest son?

- JUSTIN:

His oldest son is Matthew.
You're about to interview the Supreme Court Nominee.
This could be the biggest get our careers.
Yes, and I am more than ready, Justin.
You don't sound ready.
MARY JANE:

- baby, I do my research.

Judge McAlister is an avid bird watcher.
He competes in the Ironman competition every year in Louisville.
He could have been a concert pianist, but his mother forced him to go to law school.
He's a consummate and refined foodie, but he swears that Hop's Diner off of Route 25 in Colorado still serves the best biscuits he's ever had.
Shall I continue, Justin?
He did the Ironman in Tempe, not Louisville.
- From the top.

[Heavy Sigh]
- Too much?

Look, they're coming to enjoy the hotel pool for a couple of hours, not move in.
I just want your kids to like me.
I appreciate that you care, I really do, but this won't make them like you.
Babe, they're in that middle school phase where toys aren't cool anymore.
They're gonna be on their phones the entire time, aren't they?
Yeah.
- Come on...

It'll be fine.

Lee, I know you.
If your kids don't like me, we're done.
Yeah.
Naw, I'm kidding.
Look, you don't have to worry about anything.
They'll love you just like I do.
You're amazing... [Kisses]
And smart and beautiful...

Intelligent, delightful...

Unforgettable.
[Laughing]
And I want it to work. [Kisses]

MAN:

- MAN: [Laughing]

- All right, my man.

MEN: [Laughing]
[Mixed Conversations]
- I'm a grown woman.

Excuse me.

Do I know you?
- PJ Patterson, Comm-101.

Shit, the last time I saw you, you were rockin' sweatpants and a muscle shirt.
- Oh...

Yeah, that was a long, long time ago.
It sure was.

All roads lead to Manhattan.
- How long are you here?

I'm a real estate agent with a firm in the city.
Oh, that explains your Armani entourage up there.
Would you like to join us for a drink?
I'm actually headed out.
I have an audition in the morning.
- An acting audition?

Oh, okay.

We should catch up.
Well, I'll be here tomorrow night.
Well, maybe I'll see you then.
These guys are always down for a night of drinking.
So, I'll get you whatever you want.
I do enjoy a bottle of Dom.
- I'll get you two.

[Cell Phone Activates]
Why do you hide my phone?
I don't want you to look.
What's going on?
Is there any chance I can convince you to enjoy a morning coffee with me before you look at your phone?
MARY JANE: [Sighs]
- I'm in "The Observer"?

"Freshman correspondent at 'Great Day USA' Mary Jane Paul seeks to oust veteran anchor Ronda Sales."
Are you kidding me?
Any change of that coffee?
"Ronda Sales has had her time in the sun.
'It's my turn now, ' says Paul."
They make me sound like a five year old.
I didn't even give them this quote.
So, who did?
Ronda.
♪♪
What is with this Mary Jane Paul and Ronda Sales drama?
Mary Jane who?
She's a morning news correspondent for "Great Day USA."
Only been there a few weeks and now she's trying to take Ronda's job.
So, wait, the only two Black women on the show are now duking it out in the mud?
I wouldn't mind watchin' a mud wrestle.
- WOMAN:

- All right, but Mary Jane.

She's just a raging bitch or what?
Uh, she must be, if she's trying to go after poor Ronda Sales.
I mean, this is the woman who hosted the past four Olympic Games and has been the face of morning news since I was a kid.
I mean, she's like a national treasure at this point.
MAN:

I mean, Mary Jane's younger, she's hotter, and she's got a dope name.
So, should Ty put a white streak through my hair or should I just have him paint my face green?
And why would he do that?
Well, he gave Ronda that Glenda the Good Witch hairdo after she, um, leaked the story to "The Observer."
I'm just gonna try to embrace being the Wicked Witch.
Okay, okay, first of all, she got that haircut because she's feeling threatened, not because she leaked the story.
Second of all, she wouldn't be caught dead within a ten mile radius of that gossip rag.
So, you don't think it was her.
No.

So, it was Justin?
[Sighs]
Listen, I have a girl at the tabloids.
I'm gonna call her up and ask her if she knows anything about it, okay?
[Sighs] I appreciate that.
I've still gotta figure out a way to repair the damage.
KARA:

You have an idea?
They are sentences that start off with conjunctions.
They use the phrase "on fleek."
If you are so offended by it, help me disprove it.
And why would I wanna do that?
You're like wounded prey, oblivious to the sharks circling.
[Chuckles] That's a stretch.
Okay, suppose I do wanna put this ridiculous rivalry business to rest.
What do you have in mind?
The two of us have lunch at the corner table at Putney.
A play date.

It's the go to spot for all bloggers and tabloid reporters.
I am not gonna rest my reputation on a bunch of children with iPads.
Those bloggers have ten times the readership of "The Observer."
Anything they write spreads like wildfire.
It's like high school cafeteria all over again.
In this business, high school never ends.
No, I will not stoop to their level.
Fine.

If he actually does it.
I heard that Gayle King is making a big play for McAlister.
I can't say that it surprises me.
His handlers are probably advising him to sit with somebody with more experience.
I have experience, ten years' experience at SNC.
Ten years of late night cable news.
Hard hitting news.
You're right.
It's probably nothing.
But she does have Oprah.
Screw the haters, man.
She's just jealous because she didn't get the interview.
I know.

- Hell, yes, it is.

- Justin.

Looks like you two have a lot to talk about.
I need a commitment McAlister's still with us.
I already did.
Gayle King was sniffing around, but he's still on board.
Still, I should be the one who...
Look, I already have my doubts about you being able to pull this off.
I'm the one who got us this interview.
I have completed all of your ridiculous tests.
I am not thing but prepared.
Yeah, you're prepared for a softball interview,
- and that is changing.

- Not now.

Look, I've got a scoop.
A trusted source claims McAlister hid evidence as a prosecutor in Charlotte sending at least one innocent Black man to prison, maybe more.
And this got past everyone in Congress?
- They don't have my source.

You know I can't tell you that.
Your source is weak.
McAlister is beloved in the Black community.
People said the same thing about Clinton.
His crime bill in 1994 sent more men to prison than Nixon and Reagan combined.
Bill Clinton wasn't a racist.
But maybe McAlister is.
I need something stronger than a "maybe."
Do you?
Who exposed the Catholic church sex abuse scandal, the lead in water in Flint?
Journalists.
We have a journalistic duty to break this story.
If we do not expose this,
McAlister moves on to a lifetime appointment at the highest court in this country.
So, you expect me to sandbag the next Supreme Court Justice on national television.
No, I expect you to eviscerate him.
♪♪
[Mixed Conversations]
Oh, my God, have you been here all night?
Practically.
Looks like you need that a lot more than I do.
- Shut the door.

What's up?
Justin has a source that claims
McAlister ignored evidence to put an innocent Black man in prison.
Holy shit.
And you believe him?
I did some digging on my own and... it does seem plausible.
So, get the source to talk.
Source won't come forward.
And I'm guessing that Justin is not revealing the identity of the source.
But he expects you to go on air and what?
See if I can get the judge to crack.
Are you kidding me?
Mary Jane, you cannot attack a man who's gonna be the next Supreme Court Justice.
You're gonna look like a looney tunes Black woman who has an unsubstantiated bug up her ass.
I know, but what I can do is create some doubt.
I can ask McAlister where he stands on some of the policies at that time and maybe change the conversation at the Congressional hearings.
What if he doesn't bite?
But what if he does?
I mean, if that guy had a hand in locking even one brother up without reason...
I can't let him get a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.
All right, I'm gonna say this now.
I have a bad feeling about this, especially because it's Justin pushing you to do it.
No, I hear you.
But I've dealt with him before... and I've learned my lesson.
This time I have a plan.
- I am so sorry I'm late.

- I just have to change really fast.

- Oh!

Sorry.
- You must be Aiden.

- LEE:

- LEE:

Katherine.

- Hi.

So cute.
Can we go down to the pool now?
Yeah, no, of course.
I just have to change really fast, and then we can head down.

- Sounds great.

Come on, let's get going.
You nearly got her there.
Okay, I'm almost ready.
- May I ask you a question?

How rich are you?
Uh, well, that depends on what you consider rich.
Are you richer than our dad?
Uh, it's not appropriate to ask about money, baby.
But, yeah, she is.
Why don't you have any kids if you're rich enough to have all these toys?
Katherine, you're asking too many questions.
It's okay.
You guys, these toys are all for you.
Why don't we go down to the pool and stop with the Inquisition, eh?

But you told us to ask her questions because everything was getting awkward.
You know what is awkward?
Your dad's corny board shorts.
- That is awkward.

Yeah, Dad, why are you so embarrassing?
Come on, I'm wearing these so I can fit in with the American dads.
Would you rather I wore a Speedo?
- MARY JANE AIDEN:

Exactly, so, no complaining.
Come on, let's go.
[Laughing]
Ava, what's goin' on?
I'm sorry for making you come all the way here.
I'm freaking out about this internship thing.
Tip number one...
Don't steal from the liquor stash.
- You're right.

It's just everyone is so mean, and no one seems to notice me.
Not what you're used to, huh?
I wanna work hard.

I just don't know how to make a good impression.
My first internship was at an architectural firm in Atlanta.
Now I heard my Boss was up for a big promotion, so, the next day, I bought her a bamboo plant.
Ooh, I can do bribes.
- It wasn't a bribe.

It's the meaning that counts.
Bamboo symbolizes good luck.
Did it work?
It turned into my first paying job.
[Chuckles]
This business is so cutthroat, though.
You have a friend in TV, don't you?
I do, Andrew Cobb.
He works in reality TV, but just like you, he started out as an intern.
It's all about connections, all about networking.
You know, your mom made me think you don't take anything seriously.
I'm glad to see you're proving her wrong.
I take you seriously.
Thank you for your advice.

Let's go back to your early days as a young prosecutor in Charlotte.
It was the deadliest year on record.
Did your Boss, DA Elmore, come in with a plan to turn things around that year?
You're dancing around the issue.
Let's get straight to the point.
I mean, if I start off with a hard question, he's gonna clam up and deflect.
Okay, but this isn't an episode of "60 Minutes."
You've got about five minutes, and if you waste too much air with the Barbara Walters banter, you're gonna run out of time.
But I need more time to lure him in and set the trap.
Okay, please just explain to me how you plan on trapping a judge with over 40 years of cross examination experience?
Are you gonna give him candy?
No, I'm just trying to do what you taught me, right?
My angry Black woman approach did not work on "Talk Back."
It's definitely not gonna work here.
Okay.

I need to go the softer approach.
Like I said, you're right.
Let's do it your way.
Did you just agree with me?
Yes.

So... what?

- KARA:

So, I just off the phone with my girl over at the tabloids and she says that the leak came from the top.
The network's chief marketing officer is the one that sent the story to the tabloids.
So, this whole rivalry thing goes way above Garrett.
Well, it may have been his idea, but obviously the brass is buying it.
Maybe Ronda doesn't mind being played upon, but I do.
Oh, the judge brought his wife.
She's the attorney general.
Ronda's probably over there trying to get her to sit for an interview, as we speak.
I mean, is this gonna be my life...
Playing "Battleship" with Ronda?
I just wanna do my damn job.
Then do it, and forget Ronda, because at the end of the day, the only thing anybody's gonna remember is how you kicked ass in this interview.
So... [Clicks Tongue]
- Right.

- Watch me work.

- I would agree with that.

We got you.

Mrs. McAlister, Judge McAlister, it's so great that you are here on our show.
I was just telling them that we thought for a moment
- we'd lost them to Gayle King.

Well, I have to admit she did approach us.
But we pride ourselves on always keeping our word.
And promoting integrity and positivity is our number one goal here on "Great Day USA."
Isn't that right, Mary Jane?
Oh, absolutely, Ronda, absolutely.
Now why don't I take you on a tour of our studios?
- Yes.

- I cannot wait.

Oh!

ALL: [Laughing]
[Silently Muttering]
It is an honor to have a man with your impeccable record
- here on our show today.

I really owe a lot of that to my good friend and mentor,
District Attorney Jonathan Elmore.
He really hammered home the importance
- of prosecutorial ethics.

I mean, Elmore was one of the most highly regarded prosecutors of his time.
Well, he worked extremely hard to clean up our city.
He's a natural.
Having a wife in the public eye has served him well.
- I'll be sure to tell him so.

MARY JANE:

You can thank the crack cocaine epidemic and guns for that.
You're doing great.
You got him real comfortable.
Those were all career defining cases for you.
Well, it was never about fame for us.
It was about justice for the victims.
Okay, now it's time to go in.
I went to sleep every night with the look of
Rachel Griffiths' screaming parents in my mind.
Hm, I cannot imagine what that must have felt like,
I mean, with the whole city primed to see justice served in that case...
Especially under Elmore's Swift Justice campaign.
Well, those were very tumultuous times.
Other big cities, notably New York City, the pressure to close cases, that led to police misconduct, a rush to judgment, false confessions,
Where is she going with this?
I honestly don't know.
In our office, we're held to a much higher standard.
Well, there were no prosecutors of color in your office during your term, were there, Judge McAlister?
And a disproportionate number of your defendants were minority.
The lack of ethnic parity
Doesn't necessarily mean racial injustice.
No, we must stop this now!
Garrett, we have a problem.
You need to end this interview immediately.
Excuse me?
These are not the issues we agreed to discuss.
Your so-called correspondent out there is attacking my husband.
Justin, where is Mary Jane going with this?
Look, we have some issues that we're looking to...
If you don't do something right now, I am going to go out there and snatch him right off the set!
JUSTIN:

Justin, where are you going with this?
Mary Jane, let's wrap this up and go to commercial.
Reports show that plans like Swift Justice led to overlooked evidence, falsified evidence...
Mary Jane, throw us to commercial.
Look, this is important.

I am not gonna let this continue.
That's it, we're going to commercial in five, four...
We've never had a problem with falsified evidence or...
Let me stop you right there, Judge McAlister.
We've gotta take a commercial break.
I'll be back with more "Great Day USA."

Perry, this interview is over.
He can't just leave.
I can take her.
Don't you dare talk to me about what we can and cannot do.
Judge, why don't you just step over here for a moment?
Please, Judge, please.
Are you okay?

Okay, the, uh, the Judge and his wife have agreed to return to complete the segment.
Ronda will finish off the interview with you.

You've gotta let her finish.

Justin, I want Ronda to take the lead on this.
And I'm just supposed to sit here like a prop?
Look, it's no secret that I love the ratings boost that this rivalry has gotten us.
But if you want this to go away, then this is your chance to do it.

So, does this mean... you want me to be a part of your kids' lives?
Just don't leave your sexy underwear lying around, then we'll be fine.
I'm not, like, even a little bit special?
LEE: [Chuckling]
- Nah?

- Yeah?

Thanks.
[Kisses]
- PJ.

AVA:

I know you took my watch, Ava.

I've been nothing but nice to you, and this is how you repay me?
Oh, come on, I was just having fun.
I mean, the city view certainly did its job last night, didn't it?
Because of you,
I've ruined any chance that I had with Sunitha.
We both know that girl wasn't gonna work out.
I know guys like you.
- Really?

You never have one girl for too long, there's always some younger, hotter girl waiting in the wings.
Why not just cut to the chase?

Oh, wait, wait, slow down.

I bet you guys don't have anything like that in England.
- KATHERINE:

So, we've had the pool party.
We're having the pizza party.
What other Americanisms can my kids enjoy?
Hm... have you guys ever tried a juke box?
It's this old machine you put coins in and music comes out.
Why can't we just use our phones?
LEE MARY JANE: [Laugh]
Well, because it was made in this magical time before phones existed.
Plus, do you know, you can play what you want, and the entire restaurant has to listen to your music.
Cool. [Laughs]
Let me get you some money.
- There you go.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, say thank you, Moneybags.
- Thanks, Moneybags.

I swear, if you get that nickname started,
I'ma call you "Dad Shorts."
[Laughing] That's fair enough.
Thanks for talking to Aiden.
Oh, come on.

Ooh, there's an idea.
Kids...

I swear, you are so White.
[Chuckling]
Come on.

GARRETT:

Ronda had to literally step in to prevent the Supreme Court nominee, and his wife, from leaving in the middle of the segment.
If she had just let the segment roll to its natural end point...
The natural end point was over, okay?
Okay, let's not forget that McAlister did, in fact, railroad a man when he worked under Elmore in Charlotte.
[Sighing] That's solid?
Our research is impeccable.
And yet, they sat here in a story meeting and uttered not one word about it.
You should have looped me in.

Excuse me, but why am I here?
I'm not even on this story.

You're here to clean up the mess...
Which is way worse than I thought, by the way.
Mary Jane and Justin have totally pissed in the pool.
If we wanna use this material, and break the story, then we have to do it quickly.
- Kara?

You and Ronda are gonna take over the McAlister story.
Wait.

You guys are gonna give them your research and step outta the way.
- We did all the work.

I'm not concerned with fair, Mary Jane.
You kept this bombshell a secret because you were afraid that it was gonna go to our star, Ronda.
And guess what?

This is not why I signed up for "Great Day."
We all know why you came here, Justin.
But things change and you've gotta roll with it.
So, are we done?
Uh, no, no, no.

I need the name of Justin's source.
I'm keeping my source private.
This isn't the FBI asking, Justin.
This is your Boss.
Come on, Justin, you're just doing that to mess with us.
I'm doing that because I have a prior arrangement with them.
Look, the import of this story trumps any arrangement like that.
I have to keep my word.
- Mary Jane?

Oh, I...

That was Justin's work.
Now you're backing him up?
If that's what you wanna call telling the truth.
I don't know what to tell you.
- Kara, um..

I need some input as a producer here.
My input is that this story's gonna take a lot longer, if we don't have the source, so... we need the source.
Yep, we need the source
You two, give up the name, or you are both on internal suspension.
You get to decide what you wanna keep... your word or your job.
