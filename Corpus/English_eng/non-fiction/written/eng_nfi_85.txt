I've got more flowers.
Got you, Elena.
Someone has the carnaval spirit.
Thank you.
And Esteban's in a good mood, too.
Let me help you with those.
Carnaval was Mommy's favorite holiday.
Remember?
How could I forget?
Riding with you and your mother on the royal float was one of my last happy memories, before the dark times.
That's why I brought back the carnaval, so we can all make some more good memories, cousin.
Higgins, stop fooling around.
Great, you have the beak.
Really?
Just kidding.
But you're never just kidding.
I think I know who should be king of the carnaval, Isabel.
Yeah!
Thank you, Elena.
But I am not worthy of such an honor.
But you'd finally be king of something.
Higgins.
Just think about it, okay?
Where's Armando?
Armando!
Sorry.
El Segundo.
Victor?
So you haven't forgotten me, El Segundo.
They call me Chancellor Esteban now.
Well, Chancellor Esteban, that chicken mask suits you.
It is a phoenix, and this is not a mask.
Really?
After what you did to me, old friend,
I would think you'd be too ashamed to show your face.
Princess Elena, you are as beautiful as ever.
It was 41 years ago, after all, before Shuriki invaded, before you were trapped in that amulet.
My father was the royal treasurer when your father was king.
Victor Delgado?
It's been far too long!
Seor Flores.
Better check your pockets, abuelo.
What?
Just like old times?
You and Esteban loved practicing your sleight-of-hand tricks.
Tricks?
That was their excuse for taking things that didn't belong to them.
Seora Flores.
Please, let me introduce my daughter.
I've heard so much about all of you.
Where have you been all these years?
When Shuriki took over, we had to flee the kingdom.
We lost everything.
But now that Avalor is free,
I wanted to show Carla where I grew up.
That is why you came back?
And to celebrate carnaval, of course.
Yes, it is so wonderful of you to bring back the old traditions.
Well, how would you like to be our personal guests at the carnaval parade today?
I am sure they have other...
We would love to.
Ooh, can we take a tour of the palace first?
I've never seen anything so beautiful.
It's like a fairy tale.
I can't believe you grew up here, Papa.
El Segundo grew up here.
I was merely a visitor.
How did Esteban get that nickname?
I can't remember.
Well, when we were young, we used to race all over the palace, and Esteban always came in second.
Thus, El Segundo.
Yes, well, now that you have toured the palace, you should probably be moving on.
I'm in no hurry.
And we haven't seen where Grandfather worked yet.
I am afraid the royal treasury is not part of the tour.
It'll only take a few minutes, Esteban.
Summon the captain of the guard.
This is all yours?
Well, it belongs to the kingdom of Avalor.
We're just the caretakers.
That's what my father used to say, until Shuriki threw us out of the kingdom.
Well, most of us.
That tiara is my favorite.
It was my mother's.
But she only wore it at carnaval.
I remember how it used to sparkle in the sun.
We used to ride together on the float.
One time, when I was eight, she even let me wear the tiara.
That day, I was the happiest girl in all of Avalor.
It's magnificent.
Elena, we cannot go any closer, remember?
Right.
The whole room is rigged with booby traps, you know, in case of thieves.
Yes, it is the best system in the world.
No one could possibly get past it.
Now we should really go back downstairs.
I am sure Isabel could use some assistance with the float.
I'm so sorry.
I thought we were going that way.
Entirely my fault, seorita.
Good job.
Remember the plan.
You keep them distracted while I steal the jewels.
If you need any help with the float,
I'm happy to lend a hand.
There's one for Seor Delgado, too.
I would love to, but I am very tired from the trip.
Well, you are in luck.
Avalor City has many fine inns.
Esteban.
There's only a million rooms in the palace.
Armando!
Can you show Victor to the parlor?
Thank you, but I spent my childhood in these halls.
I know the way.
Cousin Esteban, could you put the beak back on?
It keeps coming loose.
Of course, Isabel.
But you've known him for ages.
Yes, that is how I know he's up to no good.
Were you following me?
I was just going to the... to the...
Ham and cheese.
In fact, why don't you get yourself one while you're there?
I'll meet you in the parlor.
I'll be waiting.
Hmph.
You call this a security system?
Aah!
Quarter turn to the left.
Perfect.
Higgins, where is Victor?
I told you to follow him, not fix him a snack.
Give me that.
I have had enough of your games, Victor.
What are you really doing here?
Just visiting old friends.
Is that so?
Looks like someone set off a booby trap.
You tried to steal the royal jewels.
That is nothing compared to what you did to me.
Forty-one years ago, you and I made a deal with Shuriki.
We were going to help her invade Avalor, and rule the kingdom with her.
We were partners.
But when Shuriki kicked me and my family out of Avalor, you did nothing to stop her.
What could I do?
You saw what she did to Elena's parents.
I had no choice.
You always have a choice.
For example, I could tell your family that you betrayed them all.
Keep your voice down.
Clumsy me.
You cannot tell them the truth.
I won't... if you bring me the crown jewels.
Bring me the jewels, or I tell them your secret.
Looks like we're partners once more, El Segundo.
Chancellor.
Okay, get a hold of yourself.
It's either this, or they find out the truth.

There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.
It's time to go to the parade.
What are you doing with my mother's tiara?
I...
I am bringing it to you.
Because of that story you told me about her,
I think you should wear your mother's tiara today in her honor.
And I brought something for the rest of the family, so they do not feel left out.
You look just like your mother.
I do?
Thank you, Esteban.
Coming.
What's she doing with the tiara?
Carla, Victor, time to go.
Ooh, this is so exciting.
I've never been on a royal float before.
I told you to steal the jewels.
I did, but she caught me.
She's handing them out like candy.
Get those jewels back, Esteban, or I'll tell them what you did.
The way we used to do it.
Our sleight-of-hand tricks.
I'll create a distraction, and you get the jewels off them... partner.
Isabel, Mommy wore this on your tenth birthday.
It's beautiful.
Ay, abuela, please.
It's going to be a long parade, so I brought plenty of guava juice.
Andale!
Hang on, abuela, I've got you.
Steady, abuelo.
We don't want to be late.
Isabel!
Isa, the beak is coming loose.
Don't worry, I'll fix it.
But it is on her head.
There is no way to take it without everyone seeing.
Get rid of the others.
Hey, she unhooked the float.
Why would she do that?
Adios!
Carla!
Now, get that tiara.
Now, who would like some refreshing guava juice?
Elena and Esteban are in trouble.
We have to help them, Francisco.
You already have enough jewels.
Just take them and go.
The tiara is the only piece that matters.
We're not leaving without it.
Then you are not leaving at all.
What are you doing?
What I should've done in the first place...
I'm warning you.
I'll tell her everything.
Do what you must.
It's about time you knew the truth about your dear cousin Esteban.
He made a secret deal with Shuriki to help her invade Avalor.
He betrayed your family.
That is how he stayed in power while the rest of us suffered.
I'll take that.
Esteban!
You lose again, old friend.
They locked it.
Elena, about what Victor said.
There's nothing to say, Esteban.
I know Victor was just lying to distract us.
Like you'd ever do anything to hurt your own family.
Yes, this is true.
But I do feel bad for serving Shuriki all those years.
You had no choice.
That is what I told myself, but I have always felt guilty.
You shouldn't.
You did what you had to do to survive, and when the time came, you stood up to Shuriki, and helped us defeat her.
You tried to stop Victor today.
It's time to put the past behind you.
You can't change what you did before, but you can change what you do next.
You... you're right, Elena.
I can.
We must get out of here.
We cannot let them get away with this.
Except for the beak.
I see them!
But I can't fit.
Wait, wait.
All this rocking is making the float move.
Help me get the float moving.
Just a few... more... tries.
We did it!
One of us needs to see where we are going.
Move, move!
Traffic.
Carla, they're coming.
This way.
They're headed into the park.
They're thieves, stop them!
Turn this float around.
The Crown Princess needs us!
Follow me.
Okay, veer right.
Brace yourself, Esteban.
Stop right there.
Not so fast.
I'll take those... old friend.
Captain.
Remove these thieves from our kingdom, and see that they never return.
Yes, Your Majesty.
What do we do now, Papa?
We needed that tiara.
We will find another way, Carla.
I assure you.
Avalor has not heard the last of us.
This is where your mother's tiara belongs.
Thank you, Esteban.
I wish we had something for you.
We do.
You said you weren't worthy of this honor, but I think you've earned the right to wear the crown.
Chancellor Esteban,
I hereby proclaim you... king of the carnaval.
Would you like to do the honors?
Nothing would please me more.
Let the carnaval parade begin!
