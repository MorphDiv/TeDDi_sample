N airstrike!

Man 2:

You think you can hide in a hospital?
think again.
Damn.
You're ruthless.
Wha...?
Is that a...
Whose burrito did i just step in?
I don't know.
god.
Guys, this place is getting out of hand.
I love it.

Who the hell's this kid?
I'm andrew.

Okay.

We got strange kids milling about.
Full burritos just laying around, totally unaccounted for.
That's on alba.
Just because alba's mexican
Does not mean she's responsible
For every burrito that goes missing.
Alba's guatemalan.
Exactly!

I'm not talking about the burrito, i'm talking about
The fact that she doesn't do her job.
It doesn't work like that anymore.
We all need to clean up after ourselves.
oh, we do?
These aren't my half-empty beers.
And i will dispose of them when i am finished with them.
Now get out of here, the tv's mine.
I recorded the game.

It's not even live?

Let's do this.
I've been dodging the score all day.
I'm just trying to find my lucky shirt.
Why do you need the lucky shirt if the game's already over?
Hey, check me out.
Do i look like a trashy whore or what?
what'd you do to my shirt?
I made it sexy.
Sabrina, how would you feel if i just ran around
Stealing your clothes?
You can't fit in my clothes.

It's for the maloney's white trash party, okay?
It's the biggest party of the year.
Yeah, okay.

It's gonna be awesome.

Is in my grade, so i get to go this year.
I heard their sister's bringing a bunch of her friends
From st.

Oh, yeah.

With repressed catholic school girls.
Don't pretend that doesn't terrify you.
Ah, high school's the best.
Parties suck when you get older.
No one fights or humps or breaks anything.
Everyone leave.

So we can watch the game in peace.

Sabrina, will you switch the input for me?
Ha!

Uh...

Yeah, right.
Ben, go click the input switch for me, please.
You're just sitting there.
You do it.
oh!
Boston bullpen blows it again.
Another win for toronto.
That's it!

I'm done with these losers!
Were you not disgusted by that loss?
What?

I-i just can't stop thinking about ben right now.

I mean, he's never talked to me like that before.
And so it begins.
So what begins?
Oh, the transformation.
Oh, yeah.
I see it in chip and sabrina.
One day, sweet little angels,
And the next, vile, wretched creatures
With no respect for nobody.
No, i can't afford to lose ben.
He's all i've got now.
I'm hanging on by a thread as is.
Well then, you need to start punishing him
Like his parents never did.
Absolutely not, alba.

Yeah.

I turned out pretty great.
No, you know what?

We're overthinking it.

I just got to go clear the air.
Hey, buddy.
What are you doing?

Yeah.

So i had to separate 'em.
Again?

Those guys.
You know, this whole house is kind of like an ant farm.
Really?
Oh, yeah.

In the middle, right here?
The, the really cute one?
Uh, she's kind and fair.

And all these ants around on the side, those are worker ants.
That's like you and chip and sabrina.
Do i have to build tunnels for you?
Yeah.
Yeah, i mean, if i asked you to, you would.
See, 'cause without the queen ant,
All the other ants would just be running around like kooks.
Nothing would get done.

It'd be chaos, you know?
You don't want that.

I need you to perk your little, uh, ant antenna up, right,
And-and do it.
Ben.

Well, h-hold on.
We...

So give us a second.
Uh, yeah.

Well, you don't get him now.
What's wrong with you?
We need to get mom's box of poor stuff for the party,
And he's the only one who can fit in the attic.
Okay.

Let's let him decide for himself.
Hey, ben?

What do you want to do?
Oh...

You.

But who's your big sister?

You're either with us or you're against us.
Yeah, but remember, good little ants, they get rewarded.
And bad little ants, they get squished.
Hey, ben.

You don't want to end up like our last little brother.
You had another brother?
Yeah.

Okay.

They're messing with you.
Oh, i wish we were, but we wouldn't lie
About something like that.
Okay.

Then what was his name, on the count of three?

Elliott.

Mm.
Sorry, mickey.
Oh...
Bye, mickey!

I can feel ben slipping away.
I am telling you, drop the hammer.
Otherwise, he will never learn.
You realize that is asking me to betray
Everything that i stand for.
Where do you think you're going?
School.
No, i don't think so.

Not today.
I'm punishing you.
For what?
For...
Being...

Mm.

You guys need to learn to respect me.
Why?

That's why.
I'd rather not.
Hey.
I am dead serious.
You are not going to school today,
So help me god.
Sweet.

Oh, that's...
Yeah.

But, you know,
Don't think that you just get to sit around
And do whatever you want all day.
That's not what i meant.
no, i meant, you guys...
You're grounded.
Am i grounded, too?
Oh, yeah.

Don't worry, ben.

Oh, i don't?
No more tv.

Oh-ho.
Well, okay.
Come on, give me those.

Give me...
Then i will smash your video games into oblivion.
I'll buy more.
Face it, mackenzie.
You've got no leverage.
Oh, yeah?
How about this?
Not one of you steps foot outside of this house
Until the entire thing is clean.
yeah?

Yeah, if you don't like it, why don't you clean it yourself?
You know what?
Fine with me.
Cool.
I grew up in squalor.
I am perfectly comfortable in it.
You guys want to live like this?
I think it's a great idea.
Oh, yeah.

In fact, who's this pretty lady, huh?
Oh...
This important to anyone?
Huh?
How's that?
That messy enough for you?
You guys like any of this stuff?
Oh, alba.

You're gonna want to get in on this.

(mickey and alba shouting, things crashing)
oh!

Yeah!

Yeah.
Whoa.
Yeah.

Mickey punished us.
Yeah.

Oh, good.

We're all having fun.

Hey.

Hello?
Oh, hello.

Just a sec.
What are you doing?
Oh, i'm shutting down the party.
Oh.

At you guys, huh?
Have you completely lost it?
Nah.

Okay, you know what?

Mick.

All right?

Hey, hey, hey!
Look, i don't want to be this person.
Hang up the phone.
You know?

I'm a party starter.

Hang up the phone!

Hang up the phone!
Clean up the mess!

Whoa!
Geez, let's put the claws away, all right?
Okay?

How about this?
Jimmy cleans up.
No, thanks.

It's not okay with me, though.
No, it's fine though.

I enjoy doing it.

Hello?
Hi there.

My name...

Hello?

We'll clean!

Ooh, ooh, ooh!
That was cutting it close.

Very exciting.

Okay, awesome.
Let me tell you how this is gonna go down.
Alba and i, we're gonna run out for a quick beer or six,
And we will be back in...

Make it three.

You heard the lady.

We'll be back in three hours.
Gives you plenty of time to clean up.
Oh, and in the meantime, can you guys move
That big tv upstairs to my room?
I recorded the game, and i kind of want to watch it
All cozy in my bed.
I...

No, 'cause you love to clean so much, remember?
Yeah, i could get used to this.
Oh, yeah, nice.
That's what i'm talking about.

I like it.

It's okay.

Well, yeah.

Ooh, ooh.

Bad news, though.

Bad news flying in, see...
I'm seeing a big old smudge print right here.
You seeing that, alba?
Yeah, sloppy work.
Yeah.

Pop a quick scrub on that, cinderella,
And then we'll be in business.

Yeah!

I like it.

Guys.
Super impressed.

Very good decisions here tonight.
You know what?

Good.

You guys have a great night.
Um, i hope you're not too scrubbed out.
You know, it was just basic dog psychology.
Sometimes you gotta...
Wh-what is this?
What the hell?
whoa.
no!

We're trapped!
Hey!

Sorry, we got to run.
We have a party to get to.
Oh!

Oh, i almost forgot.
Ben has something he wants to tell you.
Go ahead, ben.

Sox lost, three to zero!
I'm gonna kill you!
Jimmy!
Don't you dare!
Sorry, mick.
Party of the year.

No!

Bye!
Aunt mickey's scaring me.
Ah, don't worry.

Oh.
She's invincible.
All right.

You guys still want to party?

Yeah.

All right.

Oh, my gosh.
You guys are fun.
Thanks.

Shut up, andrew.
Oh, that's so cute.
Wait, what grade are you guys in?
Eighth.

You just...

I get that a lot.
I was held back in kindergarten
Because my body developed slow.
okay, i cannot handle
How funny you guys are.
Um...

You guys want to to go somewhere
A little more quiet,
Just so that we can kind of talk?
Him or me?
Why not both?
Can you give us a second, please?
Holy crap, is this happening?
I can't believe it.

I-i feel like we have to say yes, right?
Definitely.

No...

Make sure things don't get weird.
Okay, good idea.
Like you and i shouldn't kiss for more than five seconds.
Kiss who?
Each other.
We're not kissing at all.
What if it's a deal breaker for her?
Then we break the deal.
All right, fine, geez, we won't kiss.
Didn't know you were gonna be so weird about it.
Guys.

Everything is great.
Yeah.

Sick costume.
Five bucks.
You go that way, i'll go this way.
Suck on that, losers!
Oh!
What's the matter with you?

Look what you did to my hands!
I don't know.
I don't know.

I swear to god, i don't know.
Please.
You frickin' psycho!
Ben!
Ben!

Sabrina, are you...?
Uh...
I'm sorry.

Uh...
I'm starting to prune up.
Where the hell is she?
It doesn't take this long to get beers.
Do you think we need more bubbles?
No, we're good on bubbles.

I-it's not what it looks like.
Get out.
Yeah.

Hey.

Uh...

But...

We got plenty of bubbles.
Can i borrow this?

No.

Are you insane?

He's over there.
Ben.

But i'm having fun.
Tough crap.

No, i don't want to.
Ben, get off the table right now!
Screw you!
Uh...
Wait until i tell the moms in wine club!
Well, it's on...
Alba and jimmy, can i talk to the kids alone
For a minute, please?
I go do things in the kitchen.
Yeah, i'll, uh, give you a hand.
hey.
So...
Things got...

I mean, come on, you guys gonna ice me out all day long?
Look, i admit it, i may have gone too far.
"may have"?

Yeah, i said i was sorry.
No, you didn't.

Are you?
Yeah.

What would we be sorry about?
I don't know, destroying my room,
Telling me to screw myself,
Turning my face into a lasagna.
N-no?

No thanks.

Huh.
Okay.
Well, guess what, i am sorry,
And i would like to fix this with you guys,
So can i please take you out to dinner?
What do you say, ben?
Can you please help me out here?

I'm doing what i can.
Guess i could go for a bite.
What do you say, ben?
Can i get french fries?
(weather forecast plays on radio)
Aunt mickey, i'm hungry.
Yeah, where the hell are you taking us?
It's a surprise.

Okay.

There's no restaurant out here.
Where the hell are we?
I knew we should've ordered in.
I thought i was getting french fries.
Ever heard of gps, mickey?
Are we hunting for our food?
Yeah, where the hell are we?
I don't get any service out here.
I'm gonna take that and that.
What the hell?

See you guys at home.
What, you're just gonna leave us out here?
Listen...

And i am so sorry that your parents aren't here,
But i am.
You know?

And if you decide that you don't want me around,
Please, just tell me and i will go,
But if you decide you want me to stay,
You've got to recognize the fact that i need to be in charge.
That is the only way this is gonna work.
And fortunately, you've got the entire walk home
To figure out what you want to do.
She really left us?
Not a chance.

See?

Mm, what a loser.

Aah!
