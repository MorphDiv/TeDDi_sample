We started talking about it, and we wanted to know what had happened and why it happened.
So we called the local news station, Channel 5.
Even the news department didn't think it was that big of a deal, but they said, "We'd like to interview you.
We'd like to show this tape on the news tonight."
The incident was videotaped by an amateur cameraman from a nearby apartment.
They didn't show it till the second segment of the news.

In the early '90s, it was madness because there was no rapport between the people who were supposed to be protecting the citizens and the citizens themselves.
We just looked at them as an occupying force.
As far as Rodney King getting beat, you know the first thing I said?
"This is something what happens every day.
They just caught it on videotape."
But now it was on camera.
In Southern California tonight, white policemen and black motorists are at the center of two explosive cases.
You know, this is a man that didn't deserve to be -- be assaulted the way he was.
And it was so apparent when you saw that tape, there was something going on much more than trying to subdue a possible suspect.
What was going on was totally outside the realm of the law.

We in the black community know about those ass-whuppings.
They've been going on.
The mere fact that Rodney King beating was actually caught on tape was the only thing groundbreaking or isolated about that incident.
We thought that that videotape was gonna make a difference 25 years ago.
Los Angeles was not a stranger to civil unrest.
And we feared people getting out of control again.
Thursday, an appeals court ordered the trial to be held in a different location.
The court selects the County of Ventura as the venue for the trial of this case.
There's a lot of nice people up there.
It's predominantly white.
We have the Reagan Library.
Now we got the big trial.
There's a great deal of LAPD officers and police officers of various stripes living in the Simi Valley area.
We didn't know where the [bleep] Simi Valley was.
We had to look that up.
But critics of the police point out that unlike L.A.,
Simi Valley is a predominantly white community that is home to hundreds of law enforcement officials.
Not a single black person on the panel -- one Latino, one Asian, all the rest white.
All four officers charged in the case are white.
The victim, Rodney King, is black.
I think that if the public watches this trial, that they will have the impression that justice is done.
I don't think he'll get a fair trial.
I think it should be some blacks on there.
[ Speaks indistinctly ]
I've always had, you know, a strong foothold in the black community here in Los Angeles.
And early '92, we were shooting "Poetic Justice,"
starring Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur in Simi Valley.
We're on our way out there, anyway, right, and we hear on KFW radio that the verdicts are coming down for the police that were implicated in Rodney King's beating.
And I tell my bodyguard Shorty, "[Bleep] this movie.
We got to get to the courthouse."
Without that videotape, we wouldn't be here.
These are not Robocops, ladies and gentlemen.
They hurt, they feel pain, they bleed, and they die, just like everyone else.
Are there fears that there may be some kind of violence, depending on the way the verdict goes?
This is the man, and look at him!
This man taunted.
There has been so much pent-up outrage.
There was a lot of concern when this trial was moved from Los Angeles out here to Ventura County, a much more conservative, predominantly white county.
They don't get paid to roll around in the dirt with the likes of Rodney Glenn King.
He says, "I haven't beaten anyone this bad in a long time."
Ladies and gentlemen, that's as close as you're gonna get to a confession in this case.
As you can imagine, everybody right now is waiting anxiously to hear.
I'm told that we have the courtroom verdict, so we will go live there.
The jury has reached a verdict.

The mood of the department was they've talked to all the community leaders.
They're confident it's gonna be peaceful, et cetera, et cetera, which, from my perspective, as a patrol lieutenant,
I can't believe there's not gonna be some type of civil unrest.
Absolutely no special notices, training, or anything.
Nothing.

And his mentor was a very conservative Chief of Police.
And he seemed to have the legacy,
"White is right.
If you're black, get back."
It was a time of struggle with police power.
Chief Parker had been the Chief of Police in the '50s, early '60s.
And essentially, the police department was run more or less as an army.
Stop and frisk, find people that might be committing crime, find people that look like they should be questioned.
A lot of the tactics that were employed by the police were violative of constitutional safeguards against unreasonable search and seizure.
I will tell you, though,
I got a phone call from Daryl Gates, and he wanted to talk to Rodney King.
He said, "I'd like to be able to talk to him and give him my apologies."
And I took the phone away and I said,
"The chief is on the phone.
Would you want to talk to him?"
He said, "Tell him to suck my [bleep]"
I'm like...
"Well, Chief, he's unavailable right now, but I'm sure he'll appreciate your well wishes."
He was a great cop, and he was totally clueless about the city that he served.
Now, there's some in our community, supposedly responsible leaders, who have suggested if the verdict doesn't come out the way they believe that it ought to come out, that some will take to the streets,
and there may be some violence in the city.
He was promoted, promoted, promoted.
He was groomed to become the chief.
But at the end of the day, he really didn't fully understand the city that he was supposed to police.
My personal opinion is that the people of this city are far too mature to allow that to happen and that these are just voices in the wilderness trying to stir up some kind of -- of problem.

I've only had one encounter with the police when I was like 13 years old and I pulled a false alarm and I got roughed up for that -- more than a little bit roughed up.
And I always had a negative impression on the LAPD after that.
[ Siren walls, horn honks ]
People have asked me over the years why did we have cameras, and I said, "Well, you know, my love for videos didn't happen until I was in the military."
And I think I was in Germany when I was reading about the battering ram and picking up the kids or, you know, suspected gang members on the streets.
And the problem that, you know, the community was having with the choke hold,
I could never trust the police.
You know, whether that was in LAPD, military police,
I just had this distrust for them that stuck with me even the day I was out there filming.

And somebody had threw a brick and hit the car.
They had looked back and had saw me.

He was one of the first ones arrested, as well as her uncle, which was Mark.
And that's what actually, like, got the tension really going.
They were on 71st on one side of Normandie, and the police were on the other side.
So it was kind of like a stand-off, you know?

Police were grabbing people, you know, trying to arrest folks and just --
They were out-manned, outnumbered.
[ People shouting ]
None of the officers have shields.
We have no riot gear.
We're not prepared to go out and put down a civil unrest at this point.
Of course, the crowd was angry at the verdict they'd just heard, and the police were the target.
As I photographed, it was very noisy.
There's -- There were tires screeching...

I could hear people say, "It's Uzi time."
And on the other side of me, I heard a guy say,
"Cops gonna die tonight."
So I made the decision, "Let's get the police out of here."
The police were the targets of a community that's angry.
They had every right to be angry.
I can't believe to this day that a jury in America viewing that tape found that the officers were -- were innocent.
So why stay here?

Very luckily, one big guy, Tim, came on my right-hand side.
He put his arm around me and said,

I know what road this is gonna lead down to.
You don't want to ruin this person's life because of the anger we have.
You can see me in there telling him to leave him alone and get off, and I'm over there by his car before he takes off, telling people to back off him.
And when I got into the car,
I sat and I turned the key, and then a big rock came flying through the window.

The last images I was able to take were of the retreat, and you could tell the crowd was very empowered at this moment because they felt that they had won a-a victory.

When they actually told these police to retreat, the people of this community felt like, "Yeah!

And watching that, for some reason, I just had enough.
I walked out there and used a few choice words and said,
"Get away from him."
And I stood over him until I could figure out how to get him out of that intersection.
And then this guy walked up to me from the corner and said, "Hey, I don't care who you are.
