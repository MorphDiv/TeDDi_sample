My department has been tasked with helping the wolfbloods integrate into our society.
Looks like a computer chip.
What, like they'd used to chip dogs?
You'll never be allowed to compete again.
We'll see.
Who do you work for?
People who believe there is a wolfblood conspiracy to rule the world.
Whatever this is,
Segolia didn't ever want anyone ever finding out about it.
Hey.
- Hey.

He's trying to make it out worse than it is, so he can bunk off.
Yeah, I'm Okay.
You Okay?
Not really.
Mum and Dad's veins were popping after I ran away.
They didn't believe me about Hartington, any of it.
I just wish it had never happened.
It'll be Okay.
I promise.
Haven't you two been taken to the vets yet?
I don't want to see that.
Stay out of my way... please.
No.

Just ignore her, she's got nothing better to do and no-one to do it with.
Brilliant.
- It's not exactly Banksy, is it?

I recognise that.
That night I was kidnapped, one of the waiters had that as a tattoo.
And one of the guests... yeah, a woman.
This is something to do with Hartington.
But who did it?
What are you doing?
Sending the pictures to Jana and your mum.
Why?
- We got this.

Have we?

Wet dog?
Grandad, what are you doing?
Keeping my nose to the grindstone.
Oh, ignore him.
Oh, anyway... what can I do for you, stranger?
I'm getting my life sorted.

Oh, good times.
Hmm, what am I going to say to Robin?
- I gave her your room.

Well, I don't want to cause a problem, uhm...
I'll stay in the den.
- It's just that it's getting a bit...

Isolated.
No, move back in.

Robin's a little bit... scary.
Okay.

Oh, can't you?
It's your flat, you're alpha.
Ha.

Just for a bit, just on the sofa.
- I'm coming back tonight.

Dr. Whitewood, how have you been?
Can't complain.
I'm back at the university.
And it's Professor Whitewood now.
Ooh!
Imara's told me what's been happening.

Huh.
What are you sorry for?

No-one has the right to make us something we're not.
Speaking of which, I've got a lecture to give on the ethics of genetic manipulation in... precisely 32 minutes.
I'll get this tracking device analysed for you as soon as I can.
Thanks, and one last thing... have you heard of Project Genesis?
No, why?

It's a girl your father knew nothing about.
It's in code.
It must have been before my time there.

It's great to see you both.
Good luck with your hunt.
- Bye.

So... what do we call her now?

Lucky.
You get this?
Ah, I spoke to TJ.
He said there might be someone from Hartington's dinner party, who might have a kid in the school.
They're looking into it.
So let's get Hartington.
Grandad!

I'm telling you, it's her.
I dunno, Hannah's dodgy but...
She's not in Hartington's league.
Huh, nah.
Yeah.
Listen, if you wolf out it's just the ammunition our enemies need.
- TJ!

I'm going to use my charm.
Hey, you all right?
Look, do you know anything about the graffiti on Selina's locker?
What graffiti?
Okay.
Who do you hang around with these days?
None of your business.
Hannah, I know things might not be great for you right now...
Oh, get lost.
Listen, if you're hanging about with Hartington you've got to be careful.
- He's a dangerous guy.

You know, Har-ting-ton.
Go away, TJ, you fool.
You're a joke, with your little YouTube channel.
A clown.
All you need is a pair of size 15 trainers and a red nose.
Well, if the clown angle works with Selina, why not?
She's at a low point, could do with cheering up.
Ah!

Ha-ha!
Ha...
Nice one.
Humph, charm.
She's behind this, I know it.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
We follow her.
After school.
Oh... oh... uhm...
You mean, "Come in."
Yes, yes, that's...

Lovely... to see you.
- Glad to see someone's doing well.

- Did you have a house-warming party?

I, uhm...

What can I do for you?
Everything all right?

Only just.
He was chipped, microchipped like a dog by your friend Hartington.
We don't know who he is, where he is, who he's working for.
Yeah, well, neither do I.
Oh, come on.

Anything.
Something he said, you saw...
Yeah, but there's nothing.
I met him in a restaurant.
There was no-one else.
You know that things have not been great for me either.
I needed that film, I've lost my edge.
There's a whole bloodwolf literary multiverse out there.
Genres, subgenres, all nipping at my heels.
Not that the film makes a difference.
I won't get a penny, even if someone else makes it.
Why not?
The contract I signed...
Hartington ripped me off.
Hartington's a phoney, smoke and mirrors, it won't be worth the paper it's written on.
Yeah, you'd think that, wouldn't you?
I took it to a lawyer, it's genuine.
I won't make a penny.
I might have to think the unthinkable and go back to... teaching.
- Show me.

Show me the contract.
Uh...
You were right.
If this is a genuine contract, then the company should be listed at Companies House.
There.
That's the address.
Well, what are we waiting for?

I think Jana and I will take it from here.
Do you really think that's a good idea?

Because you, madam, can get a little bit, argh, argh, wolfy.
What you need is someone with a balanced perspective, uh-huh.
A clear head, a human but in a...

Hmm?

Is this a good idea?
Look, we need to find evidence for what that symbol means, of Hartington.
Not a fight, Okay?
Okay.
That's right, you...

Ha-ya!
Harder!

Come on!

Give me some.
Ha-ya.
That's right, the tae Kwon do werewolf.
Yeah.

Keep thinking of everyone you'd like to have a pop at.
Ta-ya!

That's right, harder.
- Ta-ya.

Huh, wow.

Ha...
I guess we know what the H stands for.
- Humans.

What are you doing?
- Got werewolves laughing at you.

She thinks she's so talented, but it's all a lie.
They all lie, Hannah.

She's only good at tae Kwon do because she's a wolfblood.
You've got so much passion, Hannah, so much dedication and skill, keep training with me and you will beat her.
What training have you done?
Uhm, weights.
Skateboarding.
General gym stuff, really.
Hmm, you both look like you could do with a little work.
Pecs for sure, and biceps.
You've still got time to turn things around.
Yeah, well... that's why we're here.
Cool.

Have you guys done any martial arts?
- No.

I'll give you a tour, you can fill out the paperwork later.
What's the plan of action?

I'm after you, Hartington.
I've got your number, sunshine.
I'm coming for you.
Yeah, this is a, uhm, very impressive store room.
But do we really need to be in here?
You think I don't know who you are?
You've got a YouTube channel, you're all over the internet!
Great.
Think of those teeth, claws... ready to attack.

You've got to attack first.

In the ring, or out.
- What's the matter?

You'll need whatever it takes, with an edge you are unstoppable.
You could take on a wolfblood, any wolfblood.
Bird, there's two howlers here.
I've locked them in the storeroom.
Here, now?
Leave this to me.

If I can beat a werewolf, so can you.
We're not werewolves!
We're wolfbloods.
Wolf... bloods.
And you can't beat me.
Clever, aren't they?
Spying on us.
I knew there'd be more, they hunt in packs.
Can't beat you?
- You challenging me, or something?

I am.
And if I win, you let my friends,
"the howlers," go.
Ooh, we have a contest.
If you can keep the wolf on the right side of your skin.
Get changed.
Keep an eye on her, Hannah.
- You're not listening to me.

There is no Hartington here!
- He's a film producer.

You can't hide, Hartington.

Excuse me, you can't just come in here...
Mr. Jeffries.
Don't let this seemingly innocent interior fool you.
He lies... for a living.
Come out, Hartington.
- I'll call the police, excuse me.

A "balanced perspective."
- Excuse me, stop it!

Excuse me, sir!

- What is it?

Careful, Jana.
Sophia!
What are you doing here?
"On a scale of 1-10, how human do you feel?"
What is this?
It's survival, that's what this is.
I've lost my friends, my job, my life...
And you... you were supposed to make sure that never happened.
So you're collaborating with the enemy?

Excuse me... enemy?
You.
You're in on this with Hartington.
Please, Mrs. Khan... continue.
What are you doing here?

You two know each other?
Agent Jones interrogated us when the secret came out.
Oh, sorry,
"assessed us."
But Jana failed to declare that my colleague was a wolfblood.
We found out afterwards... at great expense.
So you joined Hartington?
Am I supposed to know who you're talking about?

Yes, Hartington.
A wolfblood-hater.
Do carry on with your surveys.
He's a regional champion.

Being a wolfblood doesn't make you good at tae Kwon do.
Training, learning, practising, that's what makes you good.
Wolfbloods have the advantage.
It's built into you.
Speed, strength, hearing.
Humans have built-in advantage too.
Genetics, height, weight, aggression.
We're the underdogs.
No pun intended.
His phoney production company was registered to this building.
And here you are.
This is a temporary set-up.
A short-term government contract.
I can assure you I have never heard of this Hartington.
Did someone say Hartington?
- Excuse me.

You're freaking me out.
I'm on a mission for the truth, you're not invited.
But please, I have to do the...

Of course...
- I don't care about your feet.

So sorry, so sorry.
- Well, he wouldn't listen.

We know each other.
Oh, wonderful.
I'll just...
Excuse me.
There is no Hartington here.
Just me, with surveys and willing volunteers.
That survey, it's like it's been written by him.
- "How human do you feel?"

You've already assessed us!
And it all went in the bin because you conspired with Agent Smith to manipulate evidence.
So now I'm doing it all over again.
Well, help us then.
Huh,
I can't help you.
I've been demoted.
I was on your side, your best chance, now I'm shuffling papers, running focus groups, while other people make the decisions.
This just doesn't add up.
Oh, it does.

Hartington's real, he's working with others out to destroy us,
- he wants a war against us.

He kidnapped my son and he put a microchip in him.
And he made me sign a really bad contract.
- Did you report it?

Oh, please.
Fine, if you want evidence, we'll get you some evidence.
But if that survey's harmless, then you won't mind us taking a few so we can fill it out for our friends.
Knock yourself out.
And if I find out you are in this with Hartington... there will be consequences.
Wouldn't have thought you'd appreciate the classics.
Ha-ha.
You think I'm all cheap gold chains and fried chicken bones?
Think again.
I'm a pillar of the community.
I give people training, discipline... a bit of light in the shadows.
Ha!

Have it your way then.
Something's going on with Selina, I can feel it.
- Ha-ya.

Wolfblood!

- Ha-ya!

One point, Birdy.
Ha-ya.
Come on, Birdy.
Ha-ya.
Three points, Selina.
You're not bad.
- Go on, punch her!

Eight points.
It's time to put this howler in its place.

Yeah, go on, boys, go on.
What are you going to do now, wolfblood?
Knock her out, go.
- Go on, Birdy, knock her out!

A taste of your own medicine.
Ooh, what big eyes you have!
Ah!

Ha-ya!
Run!
Get after them!
Get after them!
Broom!
Through the handles.
Oh!

Cos it's metal.
This way.
It's coming.

- Are you Okay?

- Move.

Leave 'em.
Not worth it.
Inside.
What are you doing?
Selina!

I live just there.
That's right!

Why'd you help me?
It wasn't a fair fight.
Why does that matter?
You hate us werewolves!
I don't hate wolfbloods,
I just hate you.
What?
I... hate... you.
Your stupid, doe eyes, and your soulful looks, always playing the complicated loner.
Makes me sick.
So that explains why there was only graffiti on my locker.
Finally, she gets it.
Okay, so if you only hate me,
- why join a wolfblood hate group?

Birdy's been training me for a couple of years.
Long before you lot came out of the closet.
I couldn't care less about Humans, or whatever they're called.
I'm just there for the training.
To beat you, fair and square.
Oh, no.

Got you worried?
No, my phone, my clothes, they're in the gym.
I can't go home like this!
You can borrow some of my clothes.
I'll get your stuff tomorrow.
Come on then!
"Is there really an army of human-wolf hybrids"
"waiting to attack us?"
They've lifted this from some of your Bloodwolf book, you could sue.
But I can't, they can use it in whatever context they like.
- You need to delete your channel.

This morning it was all, "Act normal, go to school,"
- and now you want us to hide?

We don't know what we're dealing with here.
Microchips, surveys, propaganda...
Disparate people, seemingly unconnected.
She's right, TJ.
You'd never connect Hannah and Hartington in a million years.
What is the connection?
There isn't a connection.
What's she doing here?

It's just me.
But we're friends now.

Sorry, sorry, why is she here?
To let you know she's never even heard of Hartington and this
Humans stuff is just a coincidence.
So how do you explain this?
People are frightened.

Ignorant?
Yes, ignorant.
Well, we need to be careful.
There's a conspiracy against us, even the government now.
Jana, we don't know that for sure.
Why else would Agent Jones be at an address registered to Hartington?
Because Hartington is a master of deceit.
He's conned the best of us.
Even me!
Is it too late to get a couple of milkshakes?
Any friend of yours is friend of the Kafe's.
Selina, can I have a word please?
Hannah's on our level, and there are more humans on our side, you know?
It's not about Hannah, it's your mum.
She was at this place today, an office Hartington used to con Jeffries, filling out these for Agent Jones.
The one who interrogated us?
Speak to her, find out what you can.
We have to stay strong and stick together.
It's the only way we're going to get through this.
Have you ever heard of someone called Hartington?
No.

How long have we been living next door to these creatures?
Maybe this is all just a set-up?
Wolfbloods...
