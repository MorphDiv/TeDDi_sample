Previously on "Still the King"...
Crop circles are known to emit high levels of electromagnetic radiation.
I have a group of my own.
We are currently accepting members of all genders.
You can't invite my girlfriend to join your dumb group.
- He just did.

I'm trying to do the right thing by you.
I made this whole mess.
My career, missing out on my little girl growing up.
Now, I just wanna get back to the real me, my music.
Well, you potential fathers need to start contributing to the household.
I got a job.
I'm king stallion around these parts.
Well, maybe there's a new deputy in town.
UTI, UTI, UTI.
Hear ye, hear ye, we are here in recognition of the undiscovered.
Let no person be here unless they're here of their own free will.
Do you, Leia Fityous, vow to seek out the unknown?
I do.
And if the unknown becomes the known, do you vow to seek out an entirely different and unrelated, unknown thing?
Sure.
Well then, I hereby welcome you to the brotherhood of the... sisterhood.
Sibling... sibling hood.
Sibling hood?
Moving on.
I, Walter Baines Murray, hereby welcome you to the founding chapter of Ultra Terrestrial Investigations, henceforth knowns as UTI...
What?
- Damn it, Terry.

Cool if I eat my bologna sando in here?
I gotta go.

Enjoy that sandwich.
So, Ronnie, is there anything you wanna say to me today?
Um... you look beautiful.
Thank you.
But is there anything more today specific you wanna say?
You look beautiful today.
Whoo!
It's a really special day.
Oh, thank you.
I was lying in bed last night and had an epiphany.
Oh my God, you better wash your sheets, Vernon.
Ever since I got my old song book back, it's like the lights came on.
I need to go somewhere and play my music for people that care about the songs.
Is there anything about me today that you wanna say?
You...

- Morning.

Um, I am headed off to school.
I love you.
And?
I respect you as a person.
Bye, Dad.
- Stay out of trouble.

Nope.
Well, anyway, I better hit the bricks, too.
Gotta strike while the iron's hot.
You know what I'm saying?
Oh yeah, my iron's pretty hot, too, you know?
Uh, probably so hot it'd burn my shirt right off me before it even got the wrinkles out.
It's the wrong kind of iron, dumbass.
Oh thank you, sir.
I wasn't getting that for you.
I can't believe it.
They forgot my [bleep] birthday.
Hey, hey.
Whoo, listen up.
I bet you all are wondering why I called you here today.
To pay us for last week's gig?
Nope.
This band has been playing like a motorcycle orchestra with a ZZ Top backbone and Springsteen attitude.
He's right.

But what good is it if the songs kick ass if the right ears aren't there to hear 'em?
So tonight we're playing a showcase at the world-famous Bluebird Café.
That's huge, Vernon.
It's like we're on that TV show "Nashville."
I'd totally be Will Lexington.
Who'd you be, Mo?
Uh, let's see.
I'd be someone on one of the very few TV shows that features a black character.
Uh, hey, Vernon.

Sure.
It's nearly impossible to get a showcase at the Bluebird CafÃƒÂ©, especially last minute.
What's going on?
Son, I was a multiplatinum recording artist.
And I haven't booked it yet.
Minor technicality.
Seems like a major technicality.
Now come on, do you trust me?
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that was a rhetorical question.
Carry on!

Sales have been a little limp this month.
But in order to perk things up a bit,
I've decided to add a cherry on top of your commishes.
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!

I give to you... the Aquarius waterpik
troph.
That is the Cadillac latte waterpik, boys.
Get your mouths ready.
All you need to do... is move the most shares in our newest investment...
Trident Marina Incorporated.
Listen up.
I don't know what a waterpik is.
I don't even know what a waterpik does.
But I do know one thing.
Tonight, I'm gonna be waterpik-ing something with my brand-new waterpik.
Oh, Vance, the only thing you'll be picking is your job off the floor after I win that damn thing.
You better watch your mouth, Ronnie.
'Cause I am.
Go for Vance.
Are you alright, man?
Get back to work!
Excuse me, are you the manager?
Yeah, did you figure that out all by yourself?
A little bit psychic.
And your nametag says manager on it.
What can I do for you, bro?
Well, uh...
I'm sure you recognize who I am.
Vernon Brown.
- Nope.

Still no.
The Burnin' Vernon.
You know, adding a definite article in front of your nickname's really not helping me here.
Alright, Hoss, let me help you out here.
I had a huge monster hit back in the early '90s.
Ring any bells?
You're the guy with the mullet.
Yeah.
Now you're talking.
Kentucky Waterfalls, Missouri Compromise,
Tennessee Top Hat.
Anyway, I'm not here about my hair.
Uh, I got a killer new band, killer tunes.
And we wanna debut our songs here.
Uh... sure.
What you're gonna wanna do is, uh, go ahead and call up the office.
They will set you up with an audition.
And then if you do well there, I'll book you a slot as soon as one opens up, which basically never happens.
That's not gonna work for me, Todd.
I mean, I already promised my band we're playing here tonight.
You promised them?
Uh, what am I thinking?
What am I thinking?
Damn.
You know what I'm thinking?
That's a bummer.
You'll wait your turn like everybody else.
Care if I use your restroom before I go?
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Alright.
It's the one with the nametag bathroom on it.
Alright, thank you.
You know, normally, I wouldn't say this... but you need to drop the soap, man.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Not really.
You hear that sound?
That's the sound of your career going down the toilet.
Drop the soap, dumbass.
Drop the soap.
- Hey, Doily.

Hey, man, I could use a little help right now.
You busy?
You know where the Bluebird is?
I thought the old man day drinkers were a pain in the ass.
These new Nashville hipsters want everything small batch and muddle.
Geesh, it takes like an hour to make a damn drink.
Thanks for cheering me up.
And you're the only one who remembered my birthday.
Today is your birthday.
- It's fine.

I'm gonna fix this right now.
Excuse me, hello.
It is my best friend's birthday.
I'm actually cut, so if you could just...
I'm gonna need everybody to calm down!
Chief Health Inspector Mitchell Doily!
- I gotta talk to the manager!

- Get up, Tubby.

Could you bring it down a little bit?
You're the manager?

Okay, yeah.

I got a call from downtown saying that this establishment is in flagrant violation of Tennessee health code 3012, which states that every food service establishment must require all employees to wash their hands after using the bathroom.
We had a soap dispenser get ripped off the wall.
This place is getting shut down for two weeks while we run a thorough investigation.
Is there maybe someone else that I can talk to to straighten this whole thing out?
Are you trying to bribe me?

I am in no way trying to bribe you, sir.
Well, wait a second.
Is that Burnin' Vernon Brown?
"Billboard" magazine's 1993 hottest newcomer of the year?
Yeah.
I've always wanted to see that legend play live.
Tell you what we can do.
If you could make that dream come true for me,
I think I could overlook this minor infraction.
So it's a shakedown?
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't, you know?
Fine.
You know what?

But you two have to be alright with the fact that you're robbing a young, talented, deserving artist of their rightful spot up on that stage.
Are you okay with that?
Yep.

See ya tonight, amigo.
Here's your traveler's checks.
Enjoy your trip.
The patches came in.
Uhhhhh!
Thank you.

I don't have much real estate left on my jean jacket, but you don't actually wear these, do you?
Sometimes.

Listen, if you don't have plans tonight, we're gonna play the Bluebird CafÃƒÂ© at like 7 o'clock.
Oh, dang.
Reggie's taking me on a date.
We're going to Shrimps and Such.
Alright, well, that's cool.
Next time.
- I'll see ya at the meeting.

I promise, I'll come to your next gig.
- Alright, cool.

- Alright, see ya later.

On your marks!
Get set!
Go!
Sale!
Okay, Ronnie!
Go, go!
Remember the prize!
Keep the prize in your mind!
Br-r-r-r-r-r-r.
I'm coming for you!

Little piece of [bleep].
Ronnie, oh, yeah, yeah.
Beat down, baby!
Yeah?

It's over!

Evening.
- Hey.

License and registration, ma'am.
You were speeding.
Was I?
Uh, yes, ma'am.

Wait a second.
Is today your birthday?
Yeah, it is.
Well, happy birthday to you.
Thank you.
Nobody today remembered my birthday.
I'll tell you what.

- no problem.

Unfortunately, your license does expire on your birthday.
So I will have to write you a ticket for that.
But just hang tight, and I'll be right back, okay?
It was a hard, hard, gruelingly hard race.
But as you usual... the cream has risen to the... top.
The winner is...
Ronnie!
Now most people know today, April 3rd, is the anniversary of the founding of the Pony Express.
But here at Integrity First, it will henceforth be known as the day that young Ronnie broke all of our sales records and cemented his place into the "anals" of Integrity First history.
There we go.
Whoo-hoo!
To the victor go the spoils.
You all right, Ronnie?
You seem a million miles away.
The anniversary of the founding of the Pony Express?
That means it's April 3rd.
If it's April 3rd, that means it's Deb's birthday.
I gotta go, Coy, I'm sorry.
Run to her, Ronferd!

_
Are you guys ready for this, man?
- Oh yeah.

_
Good to be with you all this evening.
I wanna thank all of you for coming out here, especially all you folks from the music business.
Ladies, look at the vest and tell me, does he look like a turd or a jerk?
It's a real special song that I wrote about a real special young lady.
I'd like to dedicate it to her tonight.
♪ You good?

♪ Do you ever sit alone ♪
♪ Staring at your phone?

♪ A bit misunderstood ♪
He's actually kinda crazy, right?
Come on, give it up, give it up.
♪ Are you good?

Spiked hair, the vest.

- What are you thinking?

And he walked away.

I've got a card and an open tab, the ladies want drinks.
What can I get you ladies?

Hey!

Hey, dude, what's wrong with you, man?
Huh?
I'm up here trying to sing a song I wrote.
You're supposed to be from the music business, man.
Don't you wanna hear the words of the song?
I listened to your songs back in the '90s.
Eh, I think we're good.
You reckon maybe you're just a little pissed off because your lady's screwing the pool man?
Oh, oh.

Oh, I said it.
See, it looks to me like you're the one getting screwed.
I don't reckon you'd have guts enough to say it to my face, would you?
I'm looking at you right now.
I'm currently saying it to your face.
I mean, uh, closer to my face.
Uh, I get it.
Old man, bad ears.
Sure, let me help you out, pops.
See, what I'm saying is...
- Man.

Well, a DUI would be the perfect capper to this evening, I think I'll drive.
You go ahead and go, darling.
I'm gonna sit here and do a little thinking and drinking with Doily.
Don't do too much thinking.
That guy had it coming.
But, hey, I really did love the song.
Well, at least the part that I heard.
See you when you get home.
You be safe, darling.
Hunk of Burnin' Vernon Brown.
The one and only.
Mm-hmm.
I'm Courtney Hitch, I'm a producer.
And I would love to work with you.
Wait, you barely even got to hear my music.
Uh, I didn't.

I'm not really looking for a musician, Vernon.
Come on, it's Nashville, I mean, even that busboy over there probably has a great demo.
No, no, no, no.

And you, my friend, are a consummate entertainer.
The best.
- Mm-hmm.

Look, to those other guys, you're a washed up has-been, a joke.
But they're idiots.
I mean, the old way of selling music is dead.
And they're just treading water until they drown.
Check this out.
I recorded this earlier tonight when you bust that record exec over the head.
Now this already has half a million hits.
Now that's real money.
Phew.

Yeah, but that was on top of the country charts.
I'm not trying to make you the biggest star in country music.
I'm trying to make you the biggest star in the world.
It's a brave new world out there, and I just wanna make you a part of it.
Oh.
Next drink's on me.
Enjoy, gentlemen.
Hey, potato chip.
Thirty second rule.
I'll take it.
Too late.
Seriously?
Is that like a violation or anything?
Relax, I'm a health inspector.
Do you know that one?

It's my favorite.
Latin for dove.
Is that like your favorite bird or something?
No, my dad and I used to watch "Colombo" when I was a kid.
I thought the constellation was named after him.
Colombo was probably the smartest TV detective
- of all time.

Colombo's my jam, too.
Nobody saw him coming.
He's just so unassuming.
Anyway, thanks for coming.
Hope it doesn't make things weird between you and Reggie.
Let's not worry about Reggie tonight.
It's so cool you have a hookup here at the planetarium.
It pays to know astronomers.
You know what else would be cool?
You take this chatter outside.
I'm trying to enjoy the view.
_
_
Hey, get off my car!
I'm doing a thing, dweeb!
Wow, it's the designer series.
Only the best for you, babe.
You know, this morning I felt like Molly Ringwald at the beginning of "Sixteen Candles."
But now I feel like Molly Ringwald at the end of "Sixteen Candles."
Good, I'm happy.
Happy birthday, Deb.
Make a wish.
I don't need to.
It already came true.
Ronnie, you're on fire.
- Huh?

Uh, uh, uh, uh.
Deb, get it out.
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
- I found some flan.
