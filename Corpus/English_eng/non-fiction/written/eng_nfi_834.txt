Two new cases.
Nora's a widow. 80.

She's choosing not to do dialysis.
Joel has an inoperable brain tumor.
I gave them both your number.
Joel?
You had sex with our target.
We arrest her.

Is this your mom's?

She's a doctor.
Naomi collapsed onstage.
Honey, what did you take?
That stuff that was in your shed.
Please don't tell my mom.
I fainted.
I think naomi's lying.
These bottles.

It's for casper.

I need more pento.
Wanted to make sure that you were using.
And that you weren't selling.
I, troy dixon, choose to take my life.
Pentobarbital with champagne.
Okay, ladies, let's see this.
And up, down.
And up.
And four,
Three, two, one.
Let's just twist.

Twist it out!

Shake 'em!
Whoo!

Legs feeling better, nora?

The swelling's gone down.
The water always helps.
Well, see you next friday.
Good-bye, edith.
Edward and I used to come here every weekend.
We'd sit here just where you two are right now.
And watch the birds.
How was your swim, nora?

Just to be in the water one last time.
And thank you for accommodating me,
Meeting me here.
I know it's a risk, but this is such a beautiful place to die.
A little risk makes life exciting, doesn't it?
Do you have any questions or concerns?
Anything on your mind?
You've been wonderful.
I'm just happy to have this choice.
Edward was a scientist.
He always used to tell me,
Energy is not created or destroyed.
It just is.
I believe every bit of him is still around,
Just in a different form.
That's beautiful.
It's true.
She's gone.
I'm sure.
Never gonna let it go, are you?
See?

Say good-bye when you're ready in a place you love.
It should be, but it's not, so let's skedaddle.
Someone will find her, right?
God, yeah.

Swarming with people.
She left us a tip.
$5 each.

Aww.
What about joel?
What about him?

I was reviewing the journals on gbm tumors last night,
And there are several new treatment options.
My god, you had sex with him,
And now you think you two are gonna live happily ever after.
He's dying.

I'm not a woman.

I'm doing my due diligence.
Yeah, you are, duly and diligently.
Mary.
Hi.
Hey.
Do you want anything?
The coffee here is... it's bad.
It's very bad.
I'm used to bad coffee.
You know, hospitals and all.
I used to work in a place like this when I was in med school.
Covered my coffee, covered my rent.
Really?

No mom, no dad.
I'm sorry it took me a couple days to get back to you.
But I still want to help.
Great.

So, as you know, glioblastoma progresses quickly.
Everything looks fine, and then you get one bad cell.
And then it multiplies, and it multiplies...
And it multiplies, yeah.

Joel, the thing is, people are working on it.
It's actually quite exciting.
And a friend of mine is doing a clinical trial next month.
He's looking for candidates.
You're serious?
Yeah.
Jesus.

Just roll with me, okay?

Joel, wait!
You'd be perfect for one of these trials.
I mean, you're young.

You know, I've had so much chemo and radiation...
Enough to kill everything inside of me except the tumor...
In my brain, which is probably.
The only part of me I ever really liked.
I'm only trying to help you.
You really think there's something to fix, mary?
There's nothing to fix, okay?

So, this... this whole thing you're doing, it's...
It's mean.
Joel.
I need to ask you something, mom.
What is it, love?
Can you make me a grilled cheese sandwich?
'Cause I'm really hungry.
You little.
How you doing, yvonne?
No more hospitals.

No more.
I want to...

Okay.
I'll speak to the doctor today and try and get you discharged.
I can connect you with the hospital's palliative care.
No.
Charlie, no.
Charlie, what is it?
My mom wants to know.
How much morphine it would take to...
I'm sorry.
I can't tell you that.
I have someone that I can refer you to.
An independent end-of-life counselor.
Who can give you further recommendations.
Just trust me.
This one's urgent.
Yvonne kowalchuk.

It's bad.

Well, end stages, really.
She was released this morning,
And her son's been caring for her.
I quit.
It won't last.
You underestimate my willpower.
Um, how old is her son?
Charlie. 15.
And he understands?
He supports his mother's decision wholeheartedly.
He's a great kid.
Nora.
Nora?

Joel is still with us.
This isn't a same-day delivery service, okay?
I haven't yet confirmed he's a good candidate.
He's terminal.

I know, and he's exhibiting.
Highs and lows, erratic behavior.
I just want to make sure he knows what he wants.
Okay.

But I am personally vouching for yvonne, okay?
It is imminent, so, please, no foreplay.
I promised charlie, all right?
So, you do have feelings.
Buried somewhere deep down, yeah.
I'll see her later today.
Thank you.
Good luck with withdrawal.
Hello?

I'm dr.

I'm calling on behalf of joel collins.
I understand you're working with him.
Yes, joel came to eden general seeking palliative care.
Yes, I know.

He told me that you're pushing him.
Towards clinical trials.
Not pushing, but I mentioned them, yes.
I want to make sure he's aware.
He is aware.
Look...

And chemo... the whole nine.
Okay, but did you ever discuss a more radical treatment.
Like stem cell trials, osmrs?
I assure you.

I do hope that eden general can accommodate his needs.
He's suffered enough.
You're right.
Thank you.
Good job.
Yeah!
I miss it, man.
I miss it.
As soon as my wife divorces me, I'm going back to undercover.
All right, come on.

Yeah, wendy's standing between me and my damn dreams.
Your dreams?
Yeah.
You ever see those heated driveways?
No, I...
Melts the snow right off.

But wendy thinks it's frivolous, unnecessary.
Yeah, that's because I'm the one.
That's shoveling the damn driveway.
Every time it snows.
You need better dreams, my man.
I bet you know almost every entry in that journal by now.
Yeah, almost.
You spoken to his father yet?
Not since the first meeting.
But he's coming in tonight for a debrief.
I want to deliver.
Tonight?
He's a judge.

Man.
Hey, when you get mary, and you will,
You need her to tell you exactly what she's going to do...
An incriminating statement that will hold up in court.
I know, man.

All right, good.
Just go give her those puppy dog eyes,
Get this bitch to kill you.
Jumpy.
Hey, we're packed to go to dad's.
You guys have any fun plans tonight?
Whee!

Me and naomi are going to tristan's.
He's having some people over.
Naomi and i.
Me and naomi.
How is she?
She's telling everybody at school.
She had a near-death experience.
What's a near-death experience?
It's just a way of getting attention.
You know, if anything happens again with her,
You can come to me, right?
Yeah.
Hey, mama?
Yeah?

Put those in the bin.

Whoa, you okay?

Hey, mary.

Naomi, how you feeling?
You know, still breathing.
You know you can take that off.
Yeah, I know.
I just kind of like it.
Our cat is dead.
No.

Before I told her, but she asked, so...
Hey.

Casper died.
Really?
But he was only, what?

Cancer.

I had to, um, put him down.
I think you did the right thing.
You know, when they're suffering,
It's the only option.
Can I have ice cream since I'm sad?
Give me a hug.

Love you.

I'm sorry.
God, I loved that dumb cat.
You should've told me.
He's in a better place now.
I have to get that.
Hey.
Um...
You're late on your child support.
I just gave you two grand in cash.
Right.

I'll bring it when I pick up the girls.
Yeah?

Yeah.

Okay.

Hey, des, never get married.
You're the only woman I want in my life permanently,
Which is why I keep rejecting your sexual advances.
I have another call I have to take.
I'll...

Hi, joel.

You said don't buy a gun.
What?

You said that you would help me.
I want to help you.

You know what?

It's fine.

Good-bye, mary.
Joel!
Joel!
Joel!
What are you doing?
What I should've done in the first place.
You don't want to do this.

Not like this.
You should help me.
I'll help you.
You can lie down.
Thanks.
The money.
I don't want it.
Why?
I just don't.
What am I gonna do with it?
Please take it.
Come on, I don't want charity.
Please.

What medications are you taking?
Carbamazepine.

When did you take your last dose?
This morning.
Is there anyone you want to say good-bye to?
Do you want to take a moment.
Or make any phone calls?
No.
Can you tell me again?
Tell you what?
Tell me how you're gonna do it.
What do you mean?
How you're gonna kill me.
I mean, I know you... you told me how they do it in switzerland,
But just... i really want to hear how you're gonna do it.
I need to wash my hands.
Yeah, the sink's right there.
Where's your bathroom?
Down the hall.
So, you took carbamazepine this morning?
Yeah.
Can I see the bottle?
I need to know what I'm working with.
I threw it out this morning.
I thought it was my last dose.
I need to get your file.

Why do you have to get my file?
I need to confirm your medication.
Maybe you could take a moment.
To think about what you're grateful for...
All the good things in life.
You're gonna need a drink, so why don't you.
Grab a beer from the fridge?
I'll be right back.
I've been waiting half an hour.
Des, he's a cop!
Who?

I'm at his apartment right now.

How the hell do they know?

Never.

Look.

But we can't do yvonne.

So go in, make nice, and tell her.
We'll be back next week.
Get out, now.
.Yeah, talk fast.
She's by her car.

I'm going in.
No.

I'm coming down.
Mary!

God.
Hey.

So, did you think about it?
Think... think about what?
What you're grateful for.
Yes.
Yes.

Here.
Joel, listen to me.
You're obviously upset and struggling.
But, you know, to be honest, you kind of scare me.
Why do I scare you?
I wanted to help you and counsel you,
But the gun, the erratic behavior, i...
I just don't feel safe.
I have to go now.
No, please don't go.

Please.

Mary!
Things w-
She knows.
Nah.

She knows.
This is gonna be a hell of a debrief.
Yeah, what time are we meeting judge grant?
He's waiting for us now.
And the second I turn 18,
I'm gonna move to new york.

Hey, so, we said we'd be home an hour ago.
We should probably...
It's fine.

It's fine.

So, have you seen that movie "cabaret"?
No.

Of course you've seen that movie.
Well, I'm gonna be just like them.
Yeah.

I get it.

You're gonna be a star.

Yeah.
Okay.
What are you doing?
It's cocaine.
Stole it from my dad.
You want some?
No, I don't.

Hey, naomi, you were just in the hospital.
You had a...

What does it feel like?
It makes you feel like you're a star.
Okay.

That's...
I don't want to wake her.
She doesn't sleep much these days.
That's okay.

The thing is, charlie, we have a bit of a situation.
My mom wanted me to show you this.
I've had a blessed life.
I have my beautiful boy, charlie.
And when this is all over, he'll go live with his dad,
And maybe he'll even get a better haircut.
I've lived exactly the life
I wanted to live.
When it's time,
I want the choice to die...
The way I want to die.
How much is it again?
Charlie, we...
I'm afraid we're gonna have to postpone your mom's appointment.
I don't get it.
We can't help your mom.

Annie said you'd do it today.

But mom's ready.

I know.

I'm...

What?
Hey.

I'm sorry, charlie.
I said don't leave!
How'd it go with yvonne?

I'm here with charlie now,
And he's...

What?

But it's still a... a gun, nonetheless.
Tell her to come over.

He said he wants you to come over.
Annie promised.

So you're gonna help us tonight.
He said we're gonna help him...
I heard.
What's she saying?
She said, "."
My mom can't breathe.

You have to help her.
Guys, I had to get rid of the pento.
What?

What is it?
Charlie, we don't have the drugs.
Stop messing with me.
I'm not, all right?
So you can stop pointing the gun at me.
I'm gonna leave now.
Okay?

Easy.

Please don't go!
Aah!
Everything's all right, mom.

Des?

Des, are you okay?
I'm so sorry.

I... i've never even held it before, i...
My god, des, say something!
Get me a towel!
Shoulder wound.
I'd call it a graze, but it hurts like hell.
You said it was a graze.

Yeah, sure.
Please.

I really think we need to help charlie.
Okay, um, des,
You need to give me the name of your dealer.
That's a bad idea.
You know another way to get pento on short notice?
All right.
His name's grady.
I'll send you his address, let him know you're coming.
Mary...
Mary, he's not a good person.
I can handle it.

Hi.
I'm mary, des's friend.
Hi, mary.
Can you take your shirt off?
Are you kidding?
No.

I'm not taking off my shirt.
Mary, in my business, if I sell to the wrong client,
Then they make me live in a cage for 20 years.
So, your politeness and your modesty.
Is not a high priority for me.
You don't need to trust me to take my money.
Take your shirt off, mary.
Happy?

Of course.
I have a very good life.
And I'm very happy that you're not wearing a wire.
You don't have track marks.
The pento's not for me.

I just gave him a full box the other day.
He lost it.
He lost it?
Can I buy more from you?
I mean, that's what you do, right?
Do you have any kids?
I really have to get back to des.
He's in rough shape.
I have this little step-niece, maya.
She's six.
She's sleeping over.
And she just plays.
Color for hours.
Love that kid.
She's the cutest little thing.
You're kind of cute too.
You look good.
Sid,
Would you get dr.

What she came here for tonight?
You can count it if you want.
Nah, we're good.
Hey, mary?
Smile.
Judge grant, sorry to keep you waiting.
I don't mind waiting if it's for a good reason.
"Joel" just met with dr.

And?

Close?
I don't understand how it is.
That you guys don't have enough evidence.
Aren't these meetings being recorded?
Yes, but unfortunately we don't have.
Anything incriminating on tape as yet.
The... the suspect's working under the pretense.
Of being some kind of end-of-life counselor.
What about the nurse ethan mentioned in his journal?
Annie chung.

The nurse is just the liaison, sir.
I mean, she connects the patients to dr.

We burn her, we burn the whole operation.
Sir, look.

But the best way to bring dr.

To catch her in the act.
Gentlemen, my son had another year.
He could've done a clinical trial.
He could've done a million things.
What he could not have done was.
Give consent, which makes this murder.
I assure you, sir,
If dr.

Good.
Charlie!
Gonna need another towel.
Look at that.
Does it hurt?
No.

Seriously, I-i didn't mean to.
Shoot me?

There's probably a lesson about guns.
Embedded in all of this, charlie?
My mom got the gun after my dad left,
Said it made her feel safer at night.
She's close.
How can you tell?
I was a doctor, too, charlie.
Well, plastic surgeon.
It was all very pleasant.
Until I did something stupid.
And they took my license away.
Thank christ.
Charlie.
It's okay.
It's all gonna be okay.
Can I come in?
I got it, I got it, I'm fine.
Let's just do this and get out, okay?
She can't swallow.
This is our first injection.
It's not quite how I pictured it.
What are you doing?
It's her favorite song.
Jeez.

You ready to do this, or what?
I love you, mom.
I want it to be peaceful.
It will be.
Like slipping into a dream at the end of a long day.
I promise.
You got lucky.
Yeah.

Our last job.
At least we went out with a bang.
Our last job?

Since your gentleman turned out to be an officer.
Standing there with charlie tonight, des,
I know what it feels to be him.
I know.

There was no one there willing to help.
Listen to me.
Right now, they don't have anything on us.
So we just need to be smarter.
You know what?
I had a few ideas while I was bleeding to death.
Aging baby boomers are gonna want to die.
In the same manner.
Bourgeois comfort.
Now, the swiss, they know that.
That's why death tourism's such a massive business over there.
And?

To buy up property, getting ready to go legit.
I'm serious.
I'm having a...

Let's be a...

"The spa you'll never want to leave...
And you won't."
Des... if you're traveling.
The river styx, why not take a yacht?
Where's the cat?
I think I might have...

I know, I know.

But there's a reason I've never been responsible for anyone.
Or anything else.
Except for lives, as a doctor.
Yeah, look how that turned out.
Well, it's a long way to fall.
Why did you do that?
I'm mad at you.
My god, don't be mad at me.
I hate it when you're mad at me.
Where'd you go last night?
I looked for you, and you were gone.
Yeah, I left,
Because watching you be a train wreck.
Is just really, really tedious, so I...
God, seriously,
The cocaine wasn't even that good.
I mean, all that happened was, like, everything sped up,
And my heart...
Come here.

Yeah.
You... you didn't faint.
That other night at our recital, did you?
What?
You took the... the stuff from my mom's shed, right?
I'm sorry.
I'm an idiot.

You know, I think there's something wrong with my brain.
I...
Don't tell anyone about the drugs, okay?
Seriously, my mom will send me away,
And I'll never see you again.
Jess?

Yeah.

If you stop.
God, you sound like your mom.
What do you mean, I sound like my mom?
At the hospital...
I told her I took her drugs from the shed,
And she said she wouldn't tell anyone.
If I cleaned up my act.
Wait, she knew about it?
Yeah.
And she totally covered for me, too.
I'm hungry.

Hello?

I think you might know...

Troy dixon.
I found your number on this pamphlet.
Are you there?
Mary.

No.

Not what?
You're not joel.
Ben.
Still mary.
I liked you better as joel.
You liked me better dying?
Do you think I'm a criminal?
What you're doing is very illegal.
What's illegal?
Talking to people about options?
About switzerland?

If that's illegal, arrest me.
If you think I'm a criminal, arrest me.
You don't get to play god, mary.
None of us do.
I don't know what to tell you, ben.
You got the wrong girl.
