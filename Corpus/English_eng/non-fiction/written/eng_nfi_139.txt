[Terry] Ultimate Beastmaster has featured some of the toughest women from around the world.
And yet, none of them have been able to get past Level 2.
Oh, man, that hurt to watch!
[growling]
[Terry] Now, one woman thinks the Beast has met its match.
She has the determination... [in German] One day, I decided to stop practicing gymnastics and started with parkour.
[Terry] the tenacity...
I got where I am today because I always did what my heart told me to do.
[Terry] and the willpower to succeed.
[Silke] When I saw the Beast, I knew that my parkour skills would come in handy.
[Terry] Will that be enough to defeat the world's most challenging obstacle course, the Beast?
[Silke] My name is Zigzag, and I am the Ultimate Beastmaster.
[Terry] We're about to find out on Ultimate Beastmaster.
[instrumental theme music playing]
Welcome to Ultimate Beastmaster!
I'm Terry Crews.
[Terry] And they are gonna get up close and personal with some of the most terrifying obstacles they've ever seen, all with the hope of being the one competitor that makes it to the end.
[Charissa] Here's our two American competitors, ready to take on those obstacles.
First, starting in the east and ready to represent the women, is CrossFit queen Lindsay Andrew from Charlotte, North Carolina.
Her unique training regimen gives her impressive agility that should set her up for success.
CrossFit prepares you for the unknown and unknowable.
That's how I train every day, since we have no idea what this course is like.
I think it's important to demonstrate that you can do anything you put your mind to, regardless if you know what's gonna happen or not.
And so, representing my country in this competition is a really big privilege.
[Charissa] Out on the west coast is Trevor Carter from Sonora, California.
This hard-working fireman believes his job is all he needs to extinguish the competition.
I definitely have an advantage in this game.
Being a firefighter, you're pushing yourself to extremes that very few people get to.
You never know when that bell's gonna go off.
I'm taming the Beast, I'm out in the environment, and that's what a Beastmaster is.
And I'm going for it.
[Charissa] Lindsay Andrew and Trevor Carter, two competitors proud to represent their country and ready to put their hurt on the Beast in their quest to become the Ultimate Beastmaster.
Getting right into it at the head of the Beast is American Trevor Carter.
So, he's a firefighter, but he's very good at rock climbing.
[Terry] You look at him, he's very, very confident right now.
[Charissa] As you can tell, the way he breezed through the Jaw Breaker, that wasn't a problem.
Now he's on to Mother Tongue, which is much harder this time, because it's been lowered.
That means there's a much tougher jump to the transfer wall.
[Terry] He's having a little trouble negotiating it.
There he goes!
Let's see how he makes it in the brain of the Beast.
He passed the Point Thruster, passes Brain Matter.
[Charissa] Coming up on Faceplant, and we've made this a lot more difficult because we've swapped the chain with a rope.
That's going to challenge their grip.
[Terry] Trevor's a firefighter, so he should be used to climbing ropes in his training.
[Charissa] Yeah, he says he uses his fear of falling to push himself harder.
[both] He has a fear of falling!
[Terry] Let me tell you, you slam into those Energy Coils, it's a game changer.
Just couldn't hold on.
[sighs] I need to see a medic.
[Charissa] Here's tonight's first competitor from Brazil, Guilherme Medeiros.
And this is one tough guy.
[in Portuguese] I work at BOPE.
The elite squad of the Military Police of Rio de Janeiro State.
the drug traffickers of Rio de Janeiro.
When the police have no other resources, we are called.
[Charissa] Guilherme's out to prove a point, and he is doing a great job so far.
He's got 30 points.
[Terry] He's a member of BOPE, which is an elite group of men.
Only 400 are selected among the 1,000 that apply.
That makes Guilherme an expert on urban warfare.
[Charissa] Let's see if that helps him here on Faceplant, Terry.
[competitors cheering]
[Terry] Faceplant claims another victim!
I can't believe it!
He had perfect form leaping upward for the rope, but you've really got to grip it with everything you've got to stop that downward momentum.
[woman in Portuguese] So, Guilherme, how did it go?
It wasn't my day.
[Terry] Faceplant is a force to be reckoned with tonight.
[Charissa] Well, three more competitors just took their shot at the Beast.
Let's see how they fared.
Julio Córdova from Mexico hoped to fight his way through the Beast using his jujitsu moves.
[in Spanish] Well, I put down real beasts.
I put down men of flesh and blood.
But I think Brazilian jujitsu will win this time.
[Charissa] And when he took on Faceplant...
[Terry and Charissa exclaim]
[Charissa] he learned his skills were no match for the Beast.
[Terry] Next up was Mexico's Santiago López, who retired from gymnastics to start a whole new family venture.
This beautiful challenge brought us together: my parents, my brother, and me.
It's all about us, and that vineyard represents the effort, the discipline, and values we have as a family.
[Terry] The winemaker avoided getting tipsy on Brain Matter, and was ready to crush Faceplant.
[Terry] Oh, and he's sliding down into the blood!
[Terry and Charissa exclaim]
[Terry] But it was the Beast who stomped him out.
[in Spanish] Santiago's gone!
Mexico's hope!
[Charissa] After four strong competitors failed to grab the rope on Faceplant, it was up to Daesung Oh from South Korea to try and reverse that trend.
[in Korean] I'm obsessed with perfection.
So I want to be good at what I do and be in good shape.
[Charissa] He flew up Mother Tongue and across Brain Matter with so much ease, he was actually chewing bubble gum.
[in English] Go get 'em, Tiger!
[Terry] And he goes...
[Terry and Charissa exclaim] [both groaning]
[Terry] Your hands have to be callused enough to handle the rope.
Look at these calluses.
There are no calluses on there.
In fact, he was just using lotion to make sure that he wasn't ashy.
[Charissa] Daesung Oh has confirmed his spot in the next round.
Let's see who will join him.
She's getting herself pumped up.
Let's see how she's feeling.
I will now gut the Beast and turn it inside out.
[Terry] This girl is tough!
She'll get her chance soon.
[Charissa] Next up is Phelipe Young, 25 years old from Brazil, and he is no stranger to competition.
[in Portuguese] I was a gymnast.
After that, I went to the circus.
I do CrossFit.
And this makes me a very powerful athlete.
I'm prepared to use my strength, run, hang, whatever it takes.
[Charissa] The acrobat's showing off his fantastic balance on Brain Matter.
[both cheering in Portuguese] Go, Brazil!
[Charissa] Our friends next door, they've been yelling...
[Terry] Brazil!
[Charissa] for the last few minutes.
[Anderson] I don't want to see.
Wow!
[both] He did it!
[Terry] Finally, somebody made it past Faceplant!
- [crowd cheers] - [Charissa] Nice!
[Terry] This guy was in the circus, so he feels at home on these Energy Coils.
Oy, Phelipe!
[Terry] One more coil before the Mag Wall.
[Charissa] Does it again!
No one has even gotten close to getting as far as he has.
Oh, that is a great transition to the Mag Wall.
But remember, those handles fall, so he's gotta keep pace here.
There's no time to spare.
[Terry] Phelipe looking a little unsure.
I can't imagine an acrobat sees a wall like this too often.
[Charissa] Brazil's Phelipe Young takes that top spot after that amazing run.
[humming mocking tune] [in English] I just want to say that we are winning this thing!
[Charissa] After six competitors, Phelipe finally overcomes Faceplant, and let's see if these next four athletes can follow in his footsteps.
Personal trainer Eiji Semba from Japan took a risk in order to prove his manhood to the love of his life.
[in Japanese] By participating in this contest,
I'd like to show off my skills.
To show I'm a man.
This is for you.
[Charissa] But the higher jump to the transfer wall...
Whoa!
Was quite the heartbreaker.
[Terry] Having trouble.
[Terry] CrossFit queen Lindsay Andrew from the United States pumped up her training to a whole new level.
I just recently went down to Fort Jackson and got on their obstacle course.
My boyfriend was like, "Ya know, you're gonna be fine.
You went on a course that men get put on before they go to war."
[Terry] Once she went to war with the Beast...
She's over...
[Terry and Charissa exclaim]
[Terry] ...the massive jump on Mother Tongue claimed another victim.
[Charissa] No!
Then, Akio Shimofuji was Japan's last hope.
[in Japanese] A key point to win in this contest is to beat back your fear.
[Charissa] He made a fearless leap off Faceplant.
Hold on, Akio Shimofuji!
[Charissa] That was impressive.
[Terry] That was a will to win, a will to survive!
[Terry] I think he got his toe in the blood.
[Charissa] He's not in the clear yet.
[Terry] He still has to make his way, get that momentum, and he's got it.
Wow, that was a tremendous effort.
Oh, man, the rope really shredded his hands.
[Charissa] He persevered across the Energy Coils... until his injured hands cut his run short.
[Terry] South Korean weightlifting champ Hyunho Kim muscled his way across the early obstacles.
Go, go, go!
Great job!
[Charissa] But oh, watch your head!
But now he's gotta get on top of that Energy Coil.
That's how you do it!
Then he flew through the Energy Coils...
And there he goes again.
Great, great leap.
Like a pro!
[Terry] ...before he found himself unsupported on Mag Wall.
[exclaiming]
So close!
[Charissa] Eiji Semba from Japan and American Lindsay Andrew failed to place in the top eight.
The competitors are separated by a matter of seconds, and with all the falls on Faceplant, tonight's competition has really been about getting there the quickest.
And now Mexico's Julio Córdova is on the bubble with two competitors left to go.
Julio scored 30 points in a time of two minutes.
On the course now is Germany's Marco Cerullo, moving a little slow through these early obstacles.
[Terry] Yeah, and he's behind Julio's time right now.
[Terry] Silke Sollfrank cheering on her countrymate!
[Charissa] Julio's got 30 points but with a slower time.
[Terry] He's gonna have to defeat Faceplant if he wants to move on.
[Charissa] We all know how difficult that is.
If he has a bad performance, we will go to the booth of the Germans.
[Charissa] All right, if he makes this jump, that means Mexico's Julio Córdova is going home.
[Terry] Now he's gotta will his way over to the Energy Coils.
[Charissa] That means Julio Córdova has been eliminated.
Marco is an accomplished CrossFit athlete.
[Terry] Jumping is a key component to CrossFit training.
We're definitely seeing that in his performance.
[Terry and Charissa exclaim]
[Terry] That was very close!
[Charissa] And with that time, he takes over first place from Phelipe Young.
[Terry] The Brazilians are not big fans of Germany right now.
[Charissa] Yeah, Marco brags about his upper-body strength.
[Terry] He's gonna need that on the Mag Wall.
A little bit more to go.
[Terry and Charissa exclaim]
[Terry] He's into the blood!
Once you get to the inverted section of the wall, it can cause your body to swing out awkwardly.
Marco just couldn't reposition himself, and he fell into the blood.
[singing, shouting]
[Anderson in Portuguese] We passed them.
[in German] Our Brazilian colleagues.
[in English] Brazil now is winning.
[in German] Marco Cerullo, Germany, is number one.
Marco Cerullo, Germany, is number one.
[Luke in English] Thank you for coming by and telling us.
Oh, I'm so ashamed!
[in German] They know how to dance and shake their asses...
[Charissa] All kinds of problems for Brazil.
Not only is their man not in first place, but their second competitor, Guilherme Medeiros, is now sitting on the bubble with one run left to go.
[Terry] And now the moment we've all been waiting for.
Silke Sollfrank is seconds away from starting her round.
[Charissa] In this competition so far, only three other females have made it to Level 2.
She has the nickname Zigzag.
[Charissa] Now, to advance to Level 2, Silke needs to either get past Faceplant, which will give her more points than Guilherme, or get past Brain Matter in a faster time than he did.
[Terry] She's got the energy, she's got the skill.
[Charissa] She's gonna need to get up this wall quickly.
[Terry] No problem for Silke Sollfrank!
[Charissa] Guilherme watching nervously.
If Silke can make it past Brain Matter in the next 25 seconds, he's going to be eliminated.
[Charissa] Flashing those gymnastics skills.
She looks very comfortable here.
[Charissa] Guilherme Medeiros of Brazil is eliminated, and Silke will be moving on to Level 2.
Now, as you know, Terry, points are cumulative, so she needs to continue on and make every obstacle count.
[competitors cheer]
[Terry] This is gonna be difficult for Silke because she's barely five feet tall.
[Charissa] Ah, but she is a parkour athlete, so you never know.
But she was really fast.
I cannot wait to see her in Level 2.
Her parkour skills gave her the leap she needed, but she lacked the grip strength to grab the rope and stop her downward momentum.
[Charissa] And with that, we have reached the end of Level 1.
The top eight competitors look ready, and have to be thrilled they're moving on to Level 2.
Here's a look at where the leaderboard currently stands.
In the top spot is Germany's Marco Cerullo, followed by Brazil's Phelipe Young,
South Korea's Hyunho Kim, and Japan's Akio Shimofuji.
In fifth place is Silke Sollfrank from Germany, followed by South Korea's Daesung Oh,
Mexico's Santiago López, and American Trevor Carter.
[upbeat music playing]
[Terry] Check out the moves from Germany.
You think they're excited to have both competitors moving on to Level 2?
I acted like a fool making fun of the Germans.
And we lost to Germany... again!
[Rafinha] I cannot stand losing to Germany.
Here we go!
Our first competitor is Daesung Oh from South Korea, and he was one of six to go out on Faceplant in Level 1, so you can imagine he's hoping for a better performance in Level 2.
[Charissa] I'm not sure if you knew he won the 2013 National Body Change Tournament as a bodybuilder in South Korea, so you know this dude's strong.
[Terry] Okay, he's rushing a little bit.
He didn't even check the timing on that, and now he's hanging.
[Charissa] Daesung Oh is, "Oh, no."
- [Terry] Yeah, Daesung "Oh, No." - [Charissa chuckles]
[Terry] He might have to go back down on the other platform and try again.
[Charissa] I was gonna say, that's not a bad strategy.
[Terry] You have to hold on, and he's pretty tired already.
This is all soul, all heart.
Daesung Oh is going to make it if he just believes.
[Charissa] Looking a bit out of control.
[Terry] He's gotta find his balance.
And now he's out!
He could not hold on.
I'm gonna put my mike down and start clapping for that effort.
Great effort by Daesung Oh.
[Charissa] Next up, only the fourth female in the history of this competition to make it past Level 1, Silke Sollfrank.
[Charissa] Her nickname is Zigzag, so you know she's hoping she can zigzag her way up Spinal Ascent.
C'mon, Silke!
[Terry] She's doing a great job, rocking the platform.
[Terry] This girl is using strategy to make the most of her runs.
[Charissa] Whoo!
[Terry] Her will is tremendous!
[Charissa] Now heading down the next obstacle, Spinal Descent.
[Terry] And she is loving this!
Oh, no, her shoe's caught!
[Charissa] Grab it, grab it!
[Terry] She can't get it.
That shoe is now swimming in the blood.
She's got one shoe missing now, so this is gonna be tough.
[Charissa] As long as all four limbs aren't in the blood, she's still alive.
[Terry] She's got it!
[Charissa] That's 20 extra points!
[Terry] This is all upper body now.
There's nothing for her to push off of.
[Charissa] She is just willing her way onto the Stomach Churn!
Silke Sollfrank!
[Charissa] As her shoe is floating in the Beast's blood.
[Terry and Charissa] Oh!
[Terry] Into the blood of the Beast!
I think she got the wind knocked out of her.
Talk about determination!
After losing her shoe and getting wet,
Silke still went for the Point Thruster and attempted Stomach Churn.
She just came up short.
[in English] We're all part of Silke's run.
[Charissa] Up next, our third competitor in Level 2,
Santiago López from Mexico.
I'm proud to be 100% Mexican.
I was the first Mexican to win a medal in the World Cup.
I feel gymnastics has given me the tools I need to face the Beast.
[Charissa] Ah, no doubt about that.
Santiago was an incredible gymnast.
He actually tore several ligaments in his right ankle, and it forced him into retirement.
[Terry] Hopefully that doesn't play a role here on Stomach Churn.
[Charissa] This guy is a World Cup medalist.
He runs a successful winery, and now he's hoping to be the first competitor to finish Level 2.
[Terry] He just might do it.
His Olympic dreams vanished,
[Charissa] Santiago taking a little breather here, shaking it out.
[Terry] Goes right up into the Digestive Track at a great pace.
Really making a great move.
This is how you do it.
You jump down into the Dreadmill.
[Terry] Those Dreadmills are moving!
[Terry and Charissa exclaim]
[Terry] You gotta get your speed!
[Charissa] Nonetheless, that run puts Santiago in first place with 110 points.
I'm not competing against them, just myself.
I wanted to finish it.
[Charissa] Let's see how the competitors from Japan and America did on the course.
Japan's Akio Shimofuji was up first.
[Akio] By becoming the Ultimate Beastmaster,
I'd like to tell the world that the most important thing is to constantly continue challenging yourself.
[Charissa] He was doing well on the course until...
[Terry] Oh, he gets it right in the...
[Charissa] Where did he get it?
[Terry] Right in his precious packages.
[Charissa] But he recovered on Stomach Churn.
[Terry] Very smooth!
[Charissa] Sped right up the Digestive Track and through the Dreadmills...
[Terry] Amazing balance!
[Charissa] but finally lost his grip on Chain Reaction.
He fell!
[Charissa] Trevor Carter was next, keeping America in the competition.
Being a firefighter, you've gotta perform under pressure.
Your legs are heavy, you're hurting.
You're sucking in smoke, choking.
But you're going, you're moving, you're pushing through barriers.
I'm gonna go till my fingers bleed.
I'm not gonna give up.
[Charissa] He zoomed through the first two obstacles and went for the Point Thruster in style.
[Terry] He's got the Point Thruster!
[Charissa] But he had an awkward dismount off the spinning gear.
[Terry] Oh, he's off!
[Terry] He landed right on the edge and right over it.
That's where the centrifugal force is!
Okay, Terry has this thing called centrifugal force, which I know is an actual thing, but every time I ask him for the definition, he skirts by that.
If you don't understand it, you're never gonna get it.
[Charissa] Looking at the leader board,
Akio Shimofuji's run puts Japan in first place, and American Trevor Carter is in an uncomfortable fourth.
Next up, our second South Korean competitor, Hyunho Kim, is hoping he can just out-muscle the Beast in Level 2.
I'm a CrossFit coach.
Well, I was on the national team.
I was a weightlifter for Korea and had that training for the Olympics and Asian Games.
[Charissa] Clearly, he's the one to beat with that athletic background.
He's doing so well so far.
He's already got 90 points.
[Terry] There he goes!
Landed a little funny.
You gotta watch your ankles on that.
But he's okay.
Hyunho Kim really moves quick for being 200 pounds.
He's got to move through the Digestive Track.
It's starting to lower, get more steep.
[Charissa] Again, high angle!
Oh, be very careful!
Moving onto the Dreadmills.
Now, he's gotta let it swing closer.
That's it!
[Terry] He's passed the Dreadmills!
[Charissa] Moving on to Chain Reaction for another 20 points.
Hyunho is the South Korean record holder for the Snatch, Clean and Jerk, and the Back Squat, so you know he's got the strength to do well on this obstacle.
All that weightlifting now pays off.
[Terry] Uh-oh, kicking his legs now, trying to get the momentum back.
If he can hang on and make this transition, he'll be our first competitor to get to the final obstacle in Level 2.
[Terry] He's into the blood.
[Charissa] With that impressive run, he moved to the top of the leader board and eliminates his fellow South Korean, Daesung Oh.
Wow, Level 2 is way harder.
Much, much, much harder.
[Charissa] American Trevor Carter is on the bubble with two competitors left to go.
Next up is Phelipe Young.
He's competing for a very special cause.
I was raised by my mother and my aunt.
My mother always wanted me to follow the path of sports.
If I win, and I will win, that $10,000 will not be for me.
It will be for my mother and my aunt.
[Charissa] There's a lot at stake with this run.
He just has to get to the bottom of Spinal Descent to knock out Trevor Carter from the United States.
[in English] I think Phelipe win this game today.
That's why he's gonna win?
Because he's Brazilian?
That's the reason.
[Terry] He's just trying to hold on right now.
Trevor's life in the game is hanging in the balance.
[competitor] Hold on!
[Terry] Phelipe right now has to get up there.
The entire country of Brazil is counting on him.
[Terry] He's gotta drop down without getting on that...
[Charissa] Oh!
[Charissa] He is Brazil's last chance to stay in the competition.
[Terry] If he hits that deck, Phelipe is out.
It's the real-life video game.
We made fun of the Americans saying that he was better and...
Oh, I just want to say I'm so sorry, because your man who was supposed to go all the way...
That's okay, he's good.
Brazil is still a wonderful place, and it has wonderful people...
And we helped your guy now.
[Charissa] So now with that early exit, Phelipe Young and his country of Brazil have been eliminated from the competition.
American Trevor Carter is still in fifth place, but there's one more competitor to go.
[Terry] And it's Marco Cerullo from Germany who had an impressive run in Level 1.
Rafinha and I are hoping he will get through this first phase.
This way he will eliminate the American, and we can make fun of Terry Crews.
[Charissa] He just has to get past this first obstacle to advance to Level 3 and eliminate Trevor.
[in Portuguese] Let's go, Marco!
[Terry] Yeah, I hear the Brazilian hosts cheering.
It's not gonna happen, guys!
I love the patience that he's showing right here.
[Terry] The platform swing, just like Silke Sollfrank.
[Charissa] The last American standing watching and wondering if he can survive.
[Terry] At 6'3", this should've been an easier transition for this guy.
Now it's all upper body.
We just saw this with Phelipe Young, who was eliminated in the same spot.
[competitor] Come on!
[Terry groans] Oh, man!
You really got to give him credit.
[Terry] Trevor's heart has gotta be pumping just as hard.
[Terry] Marco has such long legs and a short torso that it's hard for him to get his upper body on that platform.
And now he's got 185 pounds just hanging!
[Charissa] He is refusing to let go.
Come on, Marco!
[Terry and Charissa] Oh...
[Hans] He is exhausted.
[Charissa] Trevor Carter stays in.
We've got competitors from five different countries moving on to Level 3:
Hyunho Kim of South Korea,
Akio Shimofuji from Japan,
Santiago López from Mexico,
Silke Sollfrank from Germany, and our man, Trevor Carter from the USA.
In Level 3, known as the Energy Pyramid, there's a total of 240 points up for grabs.
And our first competitor is Santiago López from Mexico.
This is the time to let my abilities act.
[countdown timer beeping]
[Terry] Here we go.
Is he gonna go for that Point Thruster?
[Charissa] And right into Coil Crawl.
Hand delivered!
You don't want to get your feet wet, because then your grip is completely gone.
[Terry] This is sinking.
[Charissa] Then you gotta make that all-important decision:
are you going right to stay the course, or are you going left to try to pick up some bonus points, which are worth 40?
[Terry] Wow, the gymnast is putting on a floor show.
Of course, the gymnastics on display.
[Charissa] Another eight feet of coil to go, and he gets 30 points.
Then he'll hit the first bonus obstacle.
[Terry] Good technique, repositioning himself to slide to the end.
[Charissa] And now for his dismount onto the Bungee Beds.
[Terry] He gets it!
We got lost in that one and got scared to death.
[Charissa] He will get 40 points if he completes the first bonus.
[Terry] He will lose 40 points if he fails.
Looking a little unsure of what his move is here.
[Terry] He gets over.
[Charissa] And he's not done yet.
He's going on to the second bonus obstacle.
[Terry] And he's on to the Trapeze.
The Tricky Trapeze.
Talk about an obstacle made for a gymnast!
Charissa, he's gotta successfully swing himself over to the third hanging bar to get the 40 points.
[Charissa] Oh, side note, those bars are nine feet apart!
[Terry] His face is showing signs of exhaustion.
[Terry] Representing Mexico.
It slips off!
[Terry] You can see his left grip slipped a little bit and he tried to reposition but didn't reach high enough and slipped off.
[panting] That was slippery.
And shaky, which changes everything.
[Charissa] Now let's see how our next competitor does on Level 3, collegiate wrestler Akio Shimofuji from Japan.
He enters with 150 points, and was second in Level 2.
I believe the key to victory here is measuring your jump well and following through calmly.
[Charissa] Here we go.
[Terry] Get your balance.
He doesn't have enough speed!
[Charissa] Oh, my goodness!
[Terry] Somehow he wasn't looking at where the end was... and he jumps too late.
The jump didn't quite go the way I wanted it to.
My footing kind of gave way.
[Charissa] After that run, Japan's Akio Shimofuji is now on the bubble.
And up next is a competitor who's very lucky to be here.
We're happy he is, but he barely qualified for Level 2.
Trevor Carter from the United States.
[Terry] Trevor has to get past Coil Crawl to stay in this competition and knock Japan's Akio Shimofuji out.
I feel pride to be at the third level.
[Terry] He has to find a way to make it to the second part.
[competitor shouts]
[Terry] And he does it.
But now he's gotta get up into the coil.
I think he could use those extra points.
Then again, he risks losing points in those bonus obstacles, so this may be the safer bet.
[competitor] Yes, yes, yes, yes!
[Terry] He's about to finish this obstacle!
[Charissa] And with that, Akio Shimofuji from Japan is eliminated.
What a pity!
[Charissa] This is gonna be difficult.
He has to climb up a field of vertical pipes to a platform that's 30 feet in the air.
[Terry] This guy is a firefighter, so he's used to sliding down poles.
The question is, can he climb up those poles?
He's doing great.
He's doing awesome!
[Charissa] This'll be great for the United States if Trevor can get another 30 points and jump into first place.
There's still two more competitors after him, and remember, only the top two advance to the final round.
Man, that face says it all.
Slides off.
[Charissa] An impressive run for Trevor Carter, earning him a total of 180 points.
It puts him in second place, but keeps him on the bubble.
There's two more competitors left.
While I was a coach, the members told me that there was nothing I couldn't do.
So everything expects me to win.
A lot of pressure.
[chuckles] They all cheer for me.
[Terry] And he gets onto the Ejector.
Past the Ejector!
[Terry] He's going for the Point Thruster, misses it, goes right into the coils... and just like that, our man Trevor Carter is eliminated.
Unfortunately, the United States is out.
[Charissa] South Korea is moving on to Level 4, and, boy, do they look thrilled.
[Terry] Hyunho didn't get high enough to get his legs onto that next coil.
[Charissa] He's decided to stay the course, meaning that he won't lose points.
[Terry] Nope.
[Charissa] This guy weighs 200 pounds, so it's gotta be tough for him to carry that weight using his upper body.
[Terry] That's one of the things with the stronger competitors.
Sometimes all the muscle puts them at a disadvantage.
[both] Oh!
[Terry] And there we go.
He was so good.
His arms gave out.
[sighs] I know.
I was gonna do this.
I'm not doing Taekwondo enough.
I should practice it more often. [laughs]
[Charissa] So, with that run,
Hyunho Kim seals his spot in the final level, putting Mexico's Santiago López on the bubble.
[Terry] Now, it all comes down to our final competitor,
Silke Sollfrank from Germany.
[Charissa] She's gone the furthest of any female in the entire Ultimate Beastmaster competition so far.
Level 3 will be quite challenging, but I am the only girl to come this far.
I did really well.
I don't have anything to lose.
[Charissa] And it's Germany's last hope.
She's gonna need 210 points to knock out Mexico's Santiago López and move on to Level 4.
Germany!
[all cheer]
[Silke laughs] Whoa!
[in English] This is so fast!
[Charissa] She's yelling, "It's so fast!"
[Terry] It's so fast!
[Charissa chuckles] Will she continue to make history and be our first female in Level 4?
[Terry] And she's got it!
Silke Sollfrank flies through this level.
[Terry] She's gonna go for the Point Thruster!
Misses it, but she stays on.
[Charissa] And she knows she's gotta go fast through this.
[Charissa] There she goes.
She's going to stay the course.
Oh, nice move!
Silke wins over the heart of the audience.
[Terry] Representing Germany!
[Charissa] Unreal!
[Terry] And representing females everywhere, all around the world.
What a smart way to go through that.
Look at that!
Extraction is up next.
[Charissa] She has to complete Extraction to move on.
Hyunho Kim has already guaranteed his spot in the finals, and look at him watching anxiously to see if he'll be competing against Silke.
[Terry] Look at that determination!
She got the pole!
She has to use that momentum to reach the other pole.
[Charissa] You know what Alicia Keys would say?
[Terry] That this girl is on fire!
She still has to get 15 feet above, and she's slipping down.
Hold on!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[Charissa] So, our last female is out of the competition, and that is it for Germany.
She put up such a tremendous fight.
She made history for all the females in this competition, and she definitely made her country proud.
Are you disappointed?
[Luke] We all took you into our hearts.
[Terry] This is it, the final level.
Hyunho Kim and Santiago López are both amazing athletes, but unfortunately only one will earn the title Beastmaster.
Let's watch them go toe to toe on the Power Source.
[Charissa] All right, we're about to kick off Level 4 of the Beast, but before we do, let's take a look at how our two finalists made it here tonight.
[Terry] That's how you do it!
In physical aspects, I was a weightlifter.
Stamina, strength and power...
I think I'm the best in those.
[Santiago] I feel gymnastics has given me the tools I need to face the Beast.
[Charissa] Nicely done!
[Santiago] To raise Mexico's flag, to compete in its name fills me with pride and happiness.
Beast, you met your match.
Ultimate Beastmaster.
Korea, I can do it!
[Charissa] It's Hyunho Kim from South Korea, versus Santiago López from Mexico.
Level 4, the Power Source, Terry.
It starts with the Foundation.
Each one of these Energy Taps is worth ten points.
[Terry] Mm-hmm.
They're both moving at a great pace right now.
And you notice the handholds get progressively smaller on the way up.
Let's go, Santiago!
Come on, buddy!
[Charissa] Santiago is almost at the Grid Lock section of the wall.
[Terry] They're both at a pretty even pace right now.
He recovered well.
[Charissa] Both of these competitors very evenly matched, literally.
Like, look, their hands are on the exact same spots right now.
He's having a really tough time with Grid Lock.
It's neck and neck.
This is anyone's game. [groans]
[Charissa] Santiago is continuing to struggle here.
Grid Lock gives you such little room to propel yourself up.
[Terry] This is why you need to give it all you've got.
[Charissa] You've come so far.
You are one of the few remaining competitors in a field of 108.
If there's ever a time to go for it, you go for it now.
Like Hyunho Kim's trying to make a move here.
There we go, some movement.
[Charissa] Twenty seconds to go!
Hyunho Kim with a slight lead!
[Terry] It is still anyone's game, but Santiago's got to make a move now!
[Terry] Here we go, five seconds.
[Charissa] Tap the one that's there!
[Terry] He's done it!
Hyunho Kim is tonight's Beastmaster.
He's headed home with $10,000.
[Charissa] And now Hyunho Kim is the next Beastmaster to qualify for the finals.
He could win $50,000 and the highly coveted title, Ultimate Beastmaster.
Wow, it's really...
It's amazing.
I never expected it to be this spectacular.
It was really fun and I won't forget about this.
I made good friends, and Santiago was great, too.
[all cheering]
