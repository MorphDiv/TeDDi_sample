Hi!

Oh hi!

I am sorry I didn't get your name?
My name is Caroline
- That's nice

What...

Hey baby!
Dai, like a buffalo dashing across the highway, why did you ruin my chance of dating her?

John is missing, da!
I've been looking for you for past 1 hour
Then you should lookforJohn
Why me, black clay-pan?

- 0resa...!

Sarathy, can't find John!
Did you check in the bathroom?
He isn't there with his wrists slit
Did you check the 1st floor window?
He didn't escape with a sari tied to the grill
Let's go to the wine shop
Don't compel me too much I'll stick to just 1 beer!
I'll bruise your face black and blue!
I'm worried the wedding might stop And you think I'm buying you a beer?

Let's look for him in the wine shop
What, da?
Where were you, da?
Went for a puff...why?
I didn't check outside, dude!
Grrrr...!
'KING QUEEN'
John and Regina are getting married now in this church
If anyone has any objection or reluctance to this marriage address it now
If not, you'll never be able to
I thank the church
In front of this gathering, John, do you agree to wed Regina?
I, John agree to take Regina as my lawful wedded wife
Thank you
Regina, do you consent to marrying John?
I, Regina take Surya-
Daddy...!
My apologies to this august assembly
I, Regina give my consent to marry John
This august assembly accepts your apology, thank you

"Honey...hug me...alright hug me...hug me however tight"
"Hey baby, will you exit from my heart please?"
"May someday to exist in my life will you cease?"
"Like Tom and Jerry, love's epitome Life is a rollercoaster ride syndrome"
"I stamped on a live wire of magnetism!"
"Marriages are made in Heaven Whose pearls of wisdom?

Machi!

How was it last night?

Um...uh...aah...!
Is your tooth troubling you?
Shut up and work
Last night was my friend's wedding night We discussed 'it' threadbare in 5th grade
Wonder what positions he'd have tried!

Nothing happened!
Why, dude?

Didn't I just say 'nothing happened'?

Dai, don't pull a fast one on me!
When we, as kids, saw 'Jagan mohini' the horror film, I was so scared
And you were drooling over Hemamalini's lusty waistline!
Was last night Aah...aahn...haan...?
Will you just stick to your work?
Don't waste my time
I'm not answerable to random stray dogs I meet on the way!
Dude, boss is on the way
Why is our boss appearing, when we haven't rubbed Alauddin's lamp?
Yesterday marriage Today why come?
Sir, profession is my 1st wife
Soooperl?
You get Rs 5000 increment, okay?
I'll take it, thanks, sir
You spent 50 lakhs on your wedding and you're not making it work
But you're working your butt off for 5000 bucks in this office
John, yesterday night what happened?
You'll not answer random stray dogs
Now kindly answer this spineless porcupine!
Sir, to random stray dog-

Are you drunk?
Heavily What will you do?
I won't do anything I'll just go to bed!
(Quiet sobs)
(song from a Tamil film)
(Louder sobs)
Sob-sob all the time
Are you some bloody big shot?
Increasing the volume as you please
If I stamp you, you'll end up with splintered cartilages!
Shut up and sleep
'Nail she hammered into the coffin In the few minutes she got in-between'
I feel real sleepy
Machi (friend) you called me last night and blabbered something
Couldn't make head or tail of it
- Just leave it, machi

You are in your house
Yes, I am
In the middle of the night, if someone drunk, knocks at your door
And sleeps next to you, how will you feel?
Will something like this happen to anyone ever?
Of course, it does To me!
Marriage is give and take
Life is all about making adjustments
I didn't want such a marriage
Looks like you might end up with a divorce!
No, machi
I agreed to this marriage for my dad's sake
So divorce is out of question I won't hurt him
But I don't like this life
He and his misshapen face!
But if you wish you can help me
- Machi

I was just speaking to our boss about your transfer
Yeah, I'm waiting for it
I don't like this place one bit
Regina, you should-
Don't try to convince me
U.S., Australia
Even Somalia!

I just want to leave this place
That's it
"Hey baby, will you exit from my heart please?"
"May someday to exist in my life will you cease?"
"Like Tom and Jerry, love's epitome Life is a rollercoaster ride syndrome"
"I stamped on a live wire of magnetism!"
"'Marriages are made in Heaven Whose pearls of wisdom?

Take a hike!
Hey, watchman!
As if I will make your life easy?

"Hey baby, will you exit from my heart please?"
"May someday to exist in my life will you cease?"
"Like Tom and Jerry, love's epitome Life is a rollercoaster ride syndrome"
"I stamped on a live wire of magnetism!"
"Marriages are made in Heaven Whose pearls of wisdom?

Mr John!
(Loud protests)
Please be quiet
What does your husband think of himself?
My pet dog Puppyma, will pee only in the play ground, next street
But your husband has puked outside my door to his mouth's content!
Daily at least 10 people complain about him ls your husband mentally challenged like baby Anjali in the film 'An]ali'?
He's an expert at creating problems in every flat!
I'll go to the police
My wife complained of no water supply
Your husband offers to set it right?
Isn't that wrong?

Middle of the night, he knocks at my door and asks me for a glass of milk!
It is not the done thing, okay?
He wakes me up at midnight, taps my head and says...
'Isn't your ground vacant Can we play cricket?

He'll be beaten black and blue
He's not 'honeymooned' as yet And wants to know if I'm free!
Stupid fellow!
He asked me 'if you are working night shifts here...' ...'who is substituting for you at home?

We've poured our heart out to her
Let's go
(Dog barking)
Dude, promise me you'll never get married
Take your hands off me
How come all married men repeat this same dialog?

How will I fulfill all my childhood dreams?

Boss is right
This newly-wed and that old dog are like a broken record!
I can't take this
Don't you believe me?
How many are drinking here because of their wife's torture?
Raise your hands
(Unanimous consent)
It's true, dude
"Hey 'blue blood' baby Why crave so yearningly?"
"Hey loony with a locked attitude Why sleep single in solitude?"
"Slumped to a stupor, she made me numb Dumped, she made me drink in a pub"
"She made me sleep on the club floor Salt she rubbed on my wounds sore"
"My buddy Gaia told me, dude, marriage is yucky!"
"I see through her disguise up close Trusting her, I fell flat on my nose"
"She's queen of duplicity, red herring Seems I'm destined to be celibacy-king"
"Girls are supported by the entire city We guys can report to which authority?"
"She has entrusted 1 year warranty But refuses a lifetime guarantee!"
Dude, police
Stop it
Why the hell are you dancing at this hour?
We can't stand female trouble at home
That's why we are here, sir
That's exactly why I'm on night duty too!
- Dude...?

"Home sweet home no longer commended 'Home away from home' wine shop instead"
"I have no peace of mind at home That's why wine shop and streets I roam"
(Humming)
Excuse me I'm talking to you!
Did I come to the wrong house?
#D3
Venkatadhri Midnight only!
Everyday you come home sozzled...aren't you ashamed?
It's midnight and you are in another man's house
Aren't you ashamed?

You are torturing her too much
Has she spoken a word to you since you got married?
What's in your mind?

Huh...?
There's nothing big in my mind
Let me show you
Want to snack on 'karasev'?
I don't like 'karasev'
Oh my God!

Who'll like you then?
Just disappear and die!
'Aiyaiyo!

It's dead and gone!
It's called 'karasev' but no one can save it!
Don't talk like a lunatic!
Won't your husband be looking for you?
I'm not yet married!
1 minute, I'll help
Go straight to the 3rd floor
Knock all the doors
The door that does not open That is your house!
Hey, I'm a good boy I'm already home
That's very impressive, dude!
You are not married, right?
There's a girl here Do you want to marry her?
Dude, this chic has et al sized right and in the right place
No problem I'll take care 1 minute Disturbance, huh?
I warned you
We'll talk about this tomorrow, leave now
Your friend just said it
Get lost!
Go...go...!

Close and go, dumbo I meant the door!
(song from a Tamil film)
(Cricket commentary)
There's somebody sick here
Address
- Sir, get in

I'll ask some family member to come over to the hospital
Sir, it's an emergency case
Please come
Who accompanied the patient?
He did, doctor
What's her name?
It starts with R
But I don't know!
How old is she?
She must be-
She's this tall...!
I don't know, doctor
How are you related to her?
Husband!
There's no point talking beyond this
He's drunk
She's okay now
You can shift her to the room
- Doctor

Her name is Regina Age 26
How long have you been married?
Around 10 days
Even if you don't like her, it's okay
But she is your wife
At least be aware of her medical details
In an emergency...!
I hope you understand
I've prescribed some heavy dosage
Give her something to eat before she takes the tablets
Take care, I will see you tomorrow
How can he treat his wife so indifferently!
1st take this, followed by this, then that
Doctor's orders, not mine!
I can't do this
I can take only small sips
Go home I'll eat and sleep
You eat Then I'll leave
Doctor's orders
if you are not angry-
May I know if this has happened before and when?
Why?
Doctor wanted me to find out
Happened twice before
But why?
Surya...
Hey!

Can I ride slowly?

You are just rolling it As if you're riding fast!
Drunken driving all around us, bro
We are stuck here and the entire city is calling the New Year in
Look at our plight...we are on the way to our office!
Our plight...?

If I'm selected in the airlines cabin crew interview I'll zip zap zoom in mid air!
Pipe down, da
Look at this hooliganism!
The girls are even worse!
Not girls...these are crass, crude chicks!
Do you know how a girl should be?
How?
Should be...

Happy New Year
What's this beer doing in your hand while driving?
Should NOT be like her!
Whaaaat?

This company is totally dependent only on me!
Bro...?
He keeps scratching me in the same spot!
What, da?
That girl keeps hounding me How do I tackle her?
Best option...!

Bro
He has switched off his phone
He'll get it from me
Hey, girls!

If anyone by the name of Surya picks up the phone, block him
Good morning, you are speaking to Airvoice Deepak

You are speaking to Airvoice Priyanka
How may I help you?
Prakash...?
Good morning, you are speaking to Airvoice Kavya

Good afternoon, you are speaking to Airvoice Kannan
Good evening, you are speaking to Airvoice Surya
How may I help you?
I want only you, sir!
I'm Annakili here
Chrompet mason's wife
My husband got me a phone in the festival discount sale offer
He charged my phone for Rs 50
I don't know why but you deducted that money
My husband got suspicious
And struck me right on my neck
I was dumbstruck!
Then he called you to inquire and what did you tell him?
'Your wife is having an affair' is what you told him!
Dai, true to my conscience, I'll ask you just 1 question
Go ahead, madam
Who am I having an affair with?
1 minute, madam I'll check and get back
Aiyaiyo!

He chased me away to my mother's house
Come and check there if you want
I'm not being 'kept' by anyone!
Please hold for a minute
Thanks for waiting
Madam, you've 'kept' a caller tune That's why it was deducted
Hey, good-for-nothing oaf!
How dare you accuse me of having an affair with a caller tune?

If I'm soft with my words I'm just a gutter
If I get offensive, it can stink more than the river C0oum!
Hello, this is Bhuvana
Tell me, madam
Someone has been calling me for past one week
Okay
He had full 'talk time' So he was talking to me
Once he used up all his minutes he asked me out to Mahabalipuram
We took to one another but now he's not taking my calls!
If you call him from customer care he'll definitely pick up the phone
If he does, we can enjoy a trio talk!
What do you say?
Sorry, madam, we don't provide such services
If you don't help me, I'll name you as the father of my unborn baby!
What did you say your name was?
Surya
Yeah, I'll write your name and hang myself outside the college!
Madam, my name is not Surya, I'm lyappan
Madam!
Brother, I'm Mahalakshmi calling from F3 police station
'Sister'?
I believe you took a girl to Mahabalipuram!
That's not me, someone else
Because you got her pregnant she committed suicide outside her college!
I felt very bad seeing that pathetic sight
Commissioner is truly mad at you
He has given us 'shoot at sight' order for you!
If you surrender of your own accord you can escape from 'encounter'
Sis...sis...!

Sister...sister...?

I'll check it out
Yov!

- What happened?

We'll be dragged to the police station
- Did you know that?

You 'trash can' fellow!

Sit down Just listen to me once
Sorry, dudes Please sit down
Slightest pretext they'll get up!
You got a personal call this morning Now a customer care call
Both you said were problematic What's the actual problem?

This morning a girl called and said her husband sent her out of the house because of me
Then another girl called to say I'm the father of her unborn baby!
Yov!

Policemen will arrest me anytime now
How will you help me?
Bro, please come with me to the police station
I don't have anyone else I'm sorry if I yelled at you
You are getting emotional during office hours often
It's normal to receive such calls in customer care
You're new to this job That's why you are stunned!
Write a complaint letter and give it to Mr Ramamurthi
- I'll do that

What?
Dai, why are you crying?
Girls are calling and torturing me
T9 Yollr phone?
Give me the number We'll trace and take action
Sir, they are calling customer care number
What to do, sir?
1st stop crying
Stop crying
Wipe those tears!
Dai, you are a new recruit That's why you are shaken up
If you receive any such calls, in future, divert them to me
I'll handle it
Will you talk to them?
Of course
You are my only savior, sir
Thank you, sir
What now?
Wanted to touch your feet and thank you!
That's enough
What histrionicsl!
Good afternoon, you are speaking to Airvoice Surya
How may I help you?
Did your wit become blunt because I teased you, Gopal?

'If you receive any such calls, in future, divert them to me'
'I Will handle it'
Looks like he took my word as gospel!
- Who's on the line?

I'm CEO of Airvoice Ramamurthi here
What you are doing is a huge blunder, dear
If you want to make fun of a single individual you must call his personal number
You should not abuse a public service center!
Sir, what does public service center mean?
It means customer care
A hub to serve customers
If you can promptly get me 4 ideal customers it'll be very convenient
- Surya?

You take 2 days off
I'll take 4 days off!
Did you switch on your phone?
No
- What is the time?

Turn it on
Why. bro?
Only guys will call girls after 10 p.m and not the other way about!
Switch it on without fear
- Do you think so?

- I turned it on

Where are you off to?
I have some work to do, bro
You don't even work during the day
What will you do now?
That girl has texted me
What does she want?
It seems she is waiting downs!
- Let's go down

You have a lion as your chaperone!
I don't want to come Please leave me
Let's check her out
Where...who is she?
Hey!

Yes, bro
'She'll definitely be a crass, crude chick!

It's time for your bro to get into the battle field!
Come with me silently and just watch how I play
If you look that side you'll be scared
Come this way
In fact don't for any reason peep out at any time...!
I'll go...talk...and solve the problem
Then we can go home together
No crying!
You're making me cry!
Are you Surya?
If I was Surya, it will be a different scene altogether!
What would you have done?
Sister, I'd have accepted, apologized, fallen at your feet and fled the scene
- How funny!

Why are you glaring at me?
He's hiding over there!
Will he not come out?
He's a scaredy-cat, sis
So you are Mr Brave heart?

No, I'm worse than him, sis
A slight misunderstanding has happened...!
Dai, it seems it is a misunderstanding
Mistake is on our side only
Dai, I believe the mistake is on their side only
Come out!
Anything else, sis?
Dai, you shut up and scoot
I'll shut and scoot from here for sure, sis
Hey Surya!
Listen, mistake is yours You hadn't even paid the bill
I settled the bill for you
But coming like this to my office is too much!
I actually came to apologize
But aren't you the one who yelled at me on New Year's night?
That's because you had a beer bottle in your hand-
Stop!
You look so decent
But, how could you yell at a girl in public?
You also look so cute and beautiful
Didn't you scold me?
I'm in a murderous rage against you
Just go
I'll start crying if you threaten me
Why are you crying?
Wipe your eyes first
I'm not crying My tear glands perspired!
I'll close my eyes
Before I open, leave this place!
Shut your eyes
Has he left?
Look there
Haven't you left yet?
One small request Do not drink beer
You'll get a paunch!
'Girls prefer innocent boys to over smart boys!

'I liked his innocence'
I'll let you know once the line clears, madam
Your voice is very sweet
Oh!

What...had fun last night, eh?
I scolded and sent her away
You scolded and sent her...where?
Why are you teasing me?
I've decided not to accompany you anywhere
Bro...?

You are 'twaiin'ing ME?

As if I won't get my chance to settle your 'twain' score!
Wait, a momentous incident is about to happen here
- Hello

- Yeah

She is calling and saying she loves me
She has to come here, no?

Bro, she usually comes by this bus
- Are you sure?

She is getting down as if she's oblivious of anything!
I believe you called him and professed your love?
- Huh?

Bro, bring that phone here
Show her
This is not my number
Bro, this isn't her number?
No, bro!

Dai, do you realize what a soup you've landed me in?

I'll try to cope in my own endearing style
A slight misunderstanding has happened
A small misunderstanding it seems
Actually mistake is ours
Oh, that too!
It seems they are to blame!
What else?
Sister, don't make fun of us
Dai, will you leave, only after I tell you to shut up and scoot?
Sis, I'll leave now Bye, younger sister!
Take care of your health, da
Some idiot tells you I called to profess my love to you
But it didn't occur to you, right?
Oh!

I'm Quins up!
I'll buy you a beer
What, da...have you got married to some guy?
Dad...?
Since you are buying me a beer and softening the blow, so I thought
Hey, just chill Then it's only love
Of course
Surya...is now working in customer care
But he's selected for airlines cabin crew position
Going to the U.S very soon
He's a very nice guy, dad
I like him very much
Then I'll like him too!
It doesn't matter whether you like him or not
It's not that, dad
He's scared to disclose our love to his dad if you cou-
Okay, I'll take care
Sir, you are-
I'm James MD of Tata Steel
Are you Muthuraman...?
Yes, sir Please come in
Tell me, sir
If it's personal we can discuss it here
If it's official, we can go to the station
It's personal, sir
My daughter Regina is studying MBA
Sir, did anyone kidnap her?
Oh, nothing of that sort
She's in love with your son, Surya
Looks like he is shy by nature
He's a little hesitant to tell you
Regina said he's going to some U.S camp
That's why I wanted to inform you beforehand
If you give your approval, we can fix the marriage date too
I have no objection
My choice is whomever my daughter loves, sir
Sir, you are from an affluent family
When you've initiated this marriage proposal why would I object?
I'm okay with this alliance
I just feel sad, my son didn't inform me personally!
That is bec-
Otherwise I'm happy Sir, you fix the marriage date
I'm glad, sir I'll fix the date and call you
Also fix the funeral date for the boy
Sir...?

When 2 lovers talk, they should discuss but not take it forward
Instead, they tell an elderly person who shamelessly broaches it to another elderly gentleman
This is unheard of in our culture and our family!
If you wish to discuss more on this subject please come to the station
You can leave now
Dar-ling?
I think his dad watches lot of soap operas on TV
He talks like those soap-dads!
Idiot!

There is only 1 way to this
Hmm...no
Darling, please tell me
Will you first go in for a register marriage?
Dad...!
If you are okay with it I'll make all the arrangements
If anyone objects, we can show the marriage certificate, simple!
I'm okay with this idea
But he's a coward!
You have to take care of that
I can't tell Surya 'I love you'
'Can we go in for a register marriage?

That's your part
I warned you earlier not to tell my father, no?
I knew he won't accept
But, you unnecessarily-
What to do now?
LGHVG it
So tell me, what is sir's bright brainwave?
Can we have a register marriage?
Hey!

No
How come, you are so bold?
The day I expressed my love to you I knew our marriage can happen only this way!
You messed it up by telling my father
Do you have the courage or not?
Seriously...is this Surya talking?

Listen, I'll not tell my father You don't tell yours either
Let's not tell our friends
Witnesses are ready
Let's get married without telling anyone
When and if any hassles arise we'll show our marriage certificate
Hey, sometimes decisions taken by men can be right too!
"You transfixed me as a mesmerized maiden My kohl lined eyes all love-laden"
"Soul mate, will this bond last to rejoice?

"In all ways worthwhile always you make me smile"
Madam, why are you here at 7:00 a.m?
Registrar will come only at 10:00 a.m
There's a wedding here from 10 to 11 in the morning
Then, another wedding from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m
One of these two must be your wedding
Do you intend waiting here till then?
He said he'll be here soon
In few more hours, it will be real hot, wait under that tree, dear
I forgot all about you!
Didn't the bridegroom come?
My dear, nowadays 50% of the guys are scared to express their love to the girls
Assuming they do, they are scared to get their parents' consent
By mistake even if they reach this marriage stage they are apprehensive about taking care of the girl for a lifetime!
These 3 categories are most common
Even now, it is not the end of the world
As usual, tell your parents you went to a farewell party
Or it got late at a friend's place
Come up with a solid excuse when you get back home
Nobody will know about this
Marry the person your parents choose
Certainly your life will be a contented one
Bye, madam
What, darling?
Krishna called me this morning
He told me you are waiting outside Saidapet Registrar's office
I expected you to get married and come home
Okay, get into the car
What song do you want to listen?
Sorry, dad
Why sorry, darling?
You were the one who gave me this idea
But I didn't even tell you
Why do you have this long face?
Let's not go back home
Let's do something interesting
- Who are you?

Who are you?
Call Surya Surya...

Will he come just because you yell out his name?
He left ages back
Uncle, please Don't play the fool
Why should I pull your legs?
He has really gone
I'm feeling sleepy Leave now
Listen, if you don't believe me come to the police station tomorrow
Go to the airport, I'll send a constable along with you
Check the flight manifesto
If Surya Muthuraman is not listed in the passengers' list to USA, ask me
Lodge a complaint I'll myself look for him
Now leave Good night!
No shame at all!
Is U.S that far to go?
Usually, boys will go in search of their girls
First time, girl's dad will go in search of the boy!
Regi...?
No,daddy
Surya wouldn't have left
Without letting me know, he wouldn't have left
Okay, stop crying
Murali, are you in the airport?
I need some information
Can you please check the manifesto of all flights that left for U.S this morning
And see if anyone by name Surya Muthuraman was on any flight
I'm telling you, certainly he wouldn't have left!
No chance!
He wouldn't have gone
His father must have threatened him-
Relax, dear
Yeah, tell me, Murali
Dad, Surya hasn't gone, right?
Dad...?
He left
Let go of him
For heaven's sake, don't cry, Regina...please
I didn't cry even when your mom passed away
But, when you cry, I feel like crying too
No daddy, I'll stop crying
You don't cry, dad
Sorry, dad
I won't cry
Let's do this
Let's keep driving as far as you wish
When we both want to go home, we'll drive back
Dad...dad...?

Dad...?
'Will you go in for a register marriage?

'If you cry, I feel like crying too, Regina!

Send the scan immediately to the Cardiology department
- ls any family member here?

Are you his daughter?
Very 1st cardiac attack
We have done a minor surgery
In another 10 days we will shift him to the general ward
He is stable
Hello, Regina This is lyappan here
Do you know Surya's whereabouts?
How is your dad now?
Dad is much better
He has been shifted to the room
Regina, I got a call from the U.S camp that Surya committed suicide
His father just left the country
Just a minute
Tell me, lyappan
I couldn't hear you inside
What happened to Surya at the camp?
I got a call that Surya has committed suicide at the U.S camp
His father just left the country
Surya's body has arrived at the airport
They're taking the body to their native town, Thiruthani
I'm also accompanying them
I wanted to keep you posted
Hey, who are you?
She's just recuperating
No sir, Regina and Surya were-
I'm unable to come to terms with this
Just leave
Sorry, sir
If the person we love, leaves our world doesn't mean it's the end of the world!
One day or the other according to our wish-list our life will also change
It will, Regina
When your mom passed away if I had also given up hope who would have been with you?
You must be with me, Regina
Everything will be alright
Darling, come here
Why are you looking so shabby?
Your beard...your shirt
I don't like you at all
I don't like you either
With a grumpy face all the time!
Have I ever asked you?
I'm feeling tired I'll go to my room
What's your problem now?
Tell me
Nothing, dear
If I say something, it will sound a cliche dad-dialog!
Or it'll seem like I am blackmailing you emotionally
Both won't set with my character!
I'll go to my room
Tell me what's bothering you
Simple!

And be happy!
Okay, go shave
I'll agree to get married
What?
Please shave, dad
I agree to get married
True love!
This is the 1st time I'm hearing how much a girl loved her guy!
I'll ask for permission at work and come back
It's okay, I'll ask my friend to be with me
You go now
I'll go to work and then call you
I don't have your phone number
Can you give me?
Hello...?
I'm John speaking
John...

Will you inform them I'm taking off?
I'm not your colleague John
John"J
Tell me
Did you take your medicine?
I did
That's why I called Okay...bye
Daaai...hey!
He is smiling like Lord Muruga in the devotional film 'Kandhan karunai'?
Daaaii!
What 'dai'?
Monday, sir
What 'Monday'?
Sorry, sir
What 'sorry'?
Only English word he knows...whatever I say, he boomerangs me with 'what'?

Sir, I was looking for you
What, John?
I've admitted my wife in hospital
She said she'd manage and sent me off to work
But my mind isn't working And my limbs feel numb
If you give me 2 hours permission I'll quickly visit her and be back, sir
- Take full day leave

Sarathy 'sir' See you 'sir'
Sir...sir, can I get 2 hours permission?
Why...?
My neighbor wanted me to get her some coconut
Then she changed her mind
But my mind isn't working And my limbs feel numb
And I can't get aunty out of my mind
If you give me permission I'll buy it for her and get back
No...no...no Work first
Can I go for a test drive?
Go...!
Thank you, chief
Funny guys!
You are as happy as a puppy with 2 tails!
Have you killed your wife?

What's wrong with you?
You're bouncing with joy
Whom are we seeing after fibbing to our boss?
You won't tell me?
Okay, pull over Let's drink some juice
- Thank you!

Did you drink the juice?
I just did
I thought of getting you some juice on the way
- No, thanks

First tell me whom we are seeing and then go inside
Here he is
You're giving me the cold shoulder
You're a Christian and praying to a Hindu God without even knowing how!
Why are you confusing everyone including the Gods?

Dai...?
Why didn't you call me?

Doesn't matter
How much is the bill amount?
Rs 18,500, ma'am
- Here

Whoever gives you a card will you swipe it at once?
I thought he is your husband
Who told you?
He was the one who signed yesterday
Just because he signed, does it make him my husband?

I'm sorry
Can't I give?
Give what?

You keep calling me as and when you like to ask if I had juice, medicines...?
That too with such proprietary, huh?
It so happened, I was depressed yesterday
You asked me and I told you Don't read more into it!
But you gave me your phone number
My watchman also has my number!
So, what?
Can I be equated with the watchman?
Listen, John
If you take advantage of me, 1 more time and try to get closer it'll turn real nasty!
You give it I'll wait outside
Hey, Regina
What's her problem?
What's wrong with her?
Leave it, dude
Tell me how to hook her!
I'm there for you Crying like a kid!
Dude, no one saw this, right?
Other than the 100 people here, nobody saw, dude
When was the 1st time you cried, dude?
Dai, forget it
Dai, when did you first cry?
Dude, at least let me drink in peace!
Dude, when was the first time you cried?
Dude...dude...!
Do you know when was the 1st time he cried?
Shhhh...apartment
It's midnight and everyone will be fast asleep
Hmm...you know it is midnight, no?
Were you concerned where your husband is?
Doyo ukn owwhe nwas the 1st ti mehe cried?

Mrs. John, don't we look like human beings to you!
Whether there's trouble or not outside the Govt wine shop in the next street daaaaily there's trouble at your doorstep here
Sorry, Mr Venkatadhiri He'll leave now
Why are you letting drunkards inside your house?
Watchman
Hey, who is a drunkard?
No panic
If somebody sees us, we'll be caught
- Get inside

Hmmm...you'll be caught?
Who's this 'Thai massage'?
Is she your wife?
I sent my wife this morning to her parents' home
This is my secretary
Stolen accessory!
And you can call the cops?
If I call, won't you be caught in a raid?
Now, go inside and flip that old newspaper quietly!
Hey!

He's the secretary of the flats here
Secretary...but he has fallen flat for his secretary inside, can't you see that?
You'll respect guys like him but my friend John...?
How did that guy address you?
Tell me
Mrs John!
Okay, are you aware you are married?
Some guy will ditch you
Knowing this, some other guy will be willing to marry you
And you'll humiliate him
You are at fault
Listen, Regina
After getting married, he must buy jasmine and sweets daily for you
Instead, he buys 3rd rate liquor and comes to see me!
Because you are at fault
In 3 months, instead of you puking because you are pregnant he's throwing up daily after drinking himself numb
Fault...fault...fault!
Let me tell you something
If women don't give in men will give money and give in to their desires
Don't make my friend go astray
Don't blabber like a lunatic
If you are truly a good friend, you won't let him also drink
Neither will you drink and make an ass of yourself at your friend's door step
How can a friend be classified good and bad?
'Friend' means good!
Do you know when was the 1st time he cried?
Oh God!

He cried the 1st time he loved...!
Now he's in love and he is crying!
I don't understand
I have to say it properly Yea...!
He is following me
Looks crazy
Hey abroad!

Natural to drool over good looking chicks!
Where are you from?
Omasi
When we ask him which city he is from he tells us a girl's name!
Out...you go
Coffee-powder face...go
Look how he exited
Come
Coffee powder has brought his cronies, da
It seems you hit my friend
We should never fight over figures, boss
Old dialog!
Hey!

Then you don't want a fight?
No,dude
Hey!

In the girls roaming here how does that figure look?
Awesome, right?
Imagine the same figure on a Sunday morning from 8:00 to 9:00 at home in her nighty?
1 cappuccino, please
Ma...give me coffee
Now do you realize?
Even the girl who sells flowers has her eyebrows tweezed
If you close all beauty parlors for a month, you'll see
Original pieces will be ordinary and out of shape
It's all make-up super!
Now tell me, should we fight over a 'figure'?
Okay, boss
Bye
He was bang on!
Yeah...?
1 minute, da
We should never fight for a figure
But we can fight for a friend!
Yeaaaahhaha!
'God is on our-'
I got tickets for Super star's film, da
But that stuffed-nose chap said house-full for a week
And he made such a scene saying we won't get tickets
We got, da Raj theater at Saidapet
I'll be there in 5 minutes to pick you up
I have to only 'brief' myself I'll be ready in a jiffy
Don't come empty handed At least manage 500 bucks
Won't I give you if I had the money?
Why do you keep saying this like a broken record?

- Get lost!

Uncle, I need to watch Super star's film Give me a 500 rupee note
- What did you want?

Why do you breathe down my neck like a dog sniffing an auto's tyre?

I'm myself suffering not able to pay up my household bills
And you want to watch a film!
Try having a family of your own Only then you'll know
You also watch a film with your friend, then you'll know how expensive it is, da
You just called me 'da' with disrespect!
Sorry, uncle, didn't brush my teeth So the words just slipped out
- Here it is

I need to get my brokerage commission
Collect the cheque before 10:30 a.m from Mr Narayanan in this address
Otherwise he'll go out of town and I'll be roaming around here
I have an important job to do
Uncle...uncle...!
Uncle, morning
Sarathy?
Come, da
Go with him and get the cheque
You know the address?
Go down Adyar bridge and turn right at the Ganesha temple
Uncle, switch off your navigator mouth
I'll take care of everything
Daiii...!
Sorry, I forgot
Off you 9Â°
Hey Dhana...see you
Am I the errands boy for your uncle?
Why should we get the cheque for him?
If it's a hassle drop me at the signal
I'll take a bus and collect the cheque
You can happily watch the film alone
When have I watched a film without you, da?
- Where should we go?

Will you get the cheque within 10 minutes'?
I will...

I'm doing this only for you Not for that useless dog
Thanks,dude ls Narayanan sir there?
You...?
Vettukili's SOH
Don't laugh
It's a God's name You'll be duly punished
Come inside
Sit down
He's bathing
You are dead if I don't get to see the film from the title card
Spray of water is getting louder
Final touch...!
He's rinsing himself I think
1 coffe-
Where are you going?
Coffee...?
Are you planning to make coffee for her?

Look at these girls Only when they come out they show off their I-phone and ask for apple juice
Inside the 4 walls of their home look how they dance even the funeral march
Sir, good morning Vettukili's son
You both look so shifty-eyed
Will you hand over the cheque in 1 piece?
We'll hand it over correctly
You still have lather popping out of your ears, please go and shower properly
See you
You're flashing your gleaming teeth like the cow in a milk ad?
We'll be late for the film
Dai!

Throw...throw, they'll show Super star's face now
Super staaaar...!
Su-per-star...!

Can't stand the ruckus and romping these boys revel in...!
Look who is talking?

Super star...!
Get up and scream, da
Super staaaar...!

Looks like a cheque
Vettu kill
Vettukili!
Sit down, da
I won't sit, da
I'm Vettu-kili (Grass-hopper)
Whatever grasshopper I'll make soup out of it!
How dare you hit my husband?
Why just hit?

Who the hell are you?
- Uncle!

What will I do?
You stepped out like a king!
Should I see you now like this?
Has your uncle hung himself unable to bear the disgrace?
That useless oaf won't resort to all that!
How well he took care of you
Sarathy...

Aunt, what happened?
Go in and see the state your uncle is in
Uncs, you are sitting like Harbhaian Singh?
Will anyone hit his uncle stretching his hand like that?
If you sit in the front row that's what anyone would do
What's all this about a row?
I was sitting in the bus in the front row
And my head hit a rod swelling up like this
But you were riding your Bullet bike?
Stop your wise cracks!
Look how cleverly that hog is covering up?

I don't even have the liberty to cry in this house!
Only if I think of your aunt my limbs quake and shake!
Must be a neurological disorder Swallow a Neurobion tablet
A phone with a battery that is low in charge yearns for a dual sim card!
Don't talk rubbish!
If your aunt gets to know this she will hang herself, da
Tell him, please
Relax...relax
You've touched an emotional chord
Still...if you want my lips to be zipped...!
Young blood...spend it as you like
See, how well I managed a sticky situation?
Uncle, even I'm 'young blood'!
You too spend it as you like
Sarathy...that cheque?
I'll give you 2 where it hurts most!
Like a dog on heat you roam around the city, no?
Collect it yourself
You should give him respect Whatever it is, he is 'family' da
Uncle, I'll be here at 6:00 a.m
I'll take Sarathy with me and get the cheque for you
I'm doing this only for you
Not for this useless dog!
Bye, da
How irresponsible can you be!
I told you, I'll be here at 6:00 a.m
- To go where?

I'm yet to wear my inner wear!
You look handsome only now
I...dai...dai
I've finished all my work I'll come in the evening
Like a bomb squad you dragged me here?

At Iaaaast!

You came yesterday and look how promptly you've brought the right man
Strip your lungi and follow me
I told you I'm not fully dressed!
Hold this, follow me Drain is a few houses away
Hey!

Hello...he is Vettukili's son!

Aiyo!

Everyone in Kerala is loitering around in a lungi
Are they all drainage cleaners?

- All because of you!

Have you brushed your teeth already?
Did you drag me all the way just to see her 'close-up' smile?

I told you we were late, lazy buffalo!
Who are you?
You forgot...yesterday...ringa-ringa cheque...

Oh!

I'm late for work, bye
Hey!

Aiyaiyo...!
All that's intact...if you could tell me your name and office address when I'm free I could drop by
But you are always free, dude
Brother...

I realize you are trying for me But I'm not the one for you
Why did you call me 'brother'?
Sometimes truth is bitter, brother
- Bye

Bye, brother
Brother, sister is going all by herself
She might be teased on the way
Why don't you act as her chaperone?
Why are you flashing your teeth at me?
Look down, honey
What?
Look out of the bus and down, honey
Look how good I am as Hercule Poirot!
Don't flatter yourself too soon
There are 40 branches in Madras!
How...40 branches?
If a mobile eatery chap can own 4 to 5 branches selling chicken fritters can't such a big corporate company have 40 branches?
How do we find out?

I found out she works in Sholinganallur in Techie park, dude
Japs are experts in all fields Look at this moron's brain
But now we must zero in on someone in the branch, right?
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaah!
That sounds like a dinosaur with a severe cold!
I've hooked a figure there Just in case!
I'll brief her tonight Talk to her tomorrow
Will you brief her...or de-brief yourself?

Yeaaaah-ahaha!
They come in different colors, like scattered 'lizard-egg candies'
Now I know why boys rush into jobs at software companies!
You go gaga over this
If you see my Sembanellaalay you'll be knocked down flat!
Hey Udumbay
You centipede!

Nothing of that sort
Tough to identify with your tanned skin!
- Grrrrrrrrrrrr!

Where's your girl?
Yeaaah...!
This foreign weirdo is your girl
To date this creature you crossed the 7 seas?
Thou!
Don't say such things Then she won't help us
She's here
Udumbay...!
Who is John here?
One who is a hand-span taller than us is John!
How can I help you, John?
Usually boys will want to find out where a girl lives, knowing her name
I'm a little 'vice-versa'
I know her address but not her name
Give me her details
She lives in Besant nagar
Which means 4 buses for that area
If 1 bus takes 10 girls...okay I'll tell you within a week
Are we giving you a dress for dry-cleaning...?
You want a week's time?
Can't you do it sooner?
Dude, we can get it faster from the milk man in that area
And you are pleading with this pursed-lip female?

You dare call me purse-lipped!
2 chimpanzees are fighting
You won't get a better chance than this...dump her immediately
This is love...unite us, da
I can't waste time on King Kong love
Hi...!
Hi...!
Look...he's acknowledging
Why am I even bothered?

We should stick to our own business, right?
Good boy!

In what way is that dog better than me...?
Quick way to reach her heart is through that dog...!
"Come in front of me, 0 my darling!"
Caesar"J
Caeeesar!
Milk biki...?
Caesar
I should have guessed!
Julie...?

What?
Cheque...?
Uncle not in town He'll be back only next week
- What?

So...will you hound me wherever I go...?
I'll follow you until you give it to me
When will you give me the cheque?
I'll get it for you tomorrow But don't embarrass me like this
Now, just go, please
Thank you, please!
- Cheque?

Excuse me Cheque?
God...

Don't hassle me like a money lender
Get lost
Okay, it seems we will get the cheque next week, dude
Did you find out?
I've narrowed it down to 4 names
I'll tell you in 2 days
Whaaaat?

John, it's not that easy to find a girl's name!
I don't need your help...go
What do you think of yourself?
You keep hounding me
Why are you here now?
First, stop flashing your 'close-up' smile!
I came only to lift her
Getup On your feet now
Don't be a drama king Your intentions are very clear
Brother...!
Please don't call me that I can't sleep at night then
Sometimes truth is bitter, brother
I told you, didn't I?

Don't pull my legs
You don't believe me, right?
That blue shirt over there His name is Bushan
I'm in love with him for 3 years sincerely
I have shamelessly professed my love twice
But he has not reciprocated
My fate!
Isn't he a cool cat!
My darling!
Generally, girls should only follow boys and hook them
Not the other way round
We can write this on the back of an auto-rickshaw?
Turn around, I'll write Pain in the wrong place!
Don't take me for a ride
You look sooooper He's like a scary monster!
â™ª A KHomeny007

He can't get away with it
You still don't believe me, right?
No chance at all Don't irritate me even more
Wait...!
Bushan
What's your name?
John
He's John My brother
Hey John...!
Take a hike!
He's Bushan My boy friend
Why do you yell out 'brother'?
And whisper 'boyfriend'?
Generally girls don't acknowledge their boyfriends in public!
Why...you can always get another one?
I'm available
You and your jammed-face!
- Keerthana...?

Come to my cabin, we have to send that mail immediately
- Come soon

He wants me in his cabin
See you, brother
Now we know her name Keerthana it seems
Hey Keerthana!
I missed your mobile number
Give me your number
'Oh!

I'll text it to you myself
I've changed my number
New number, that's why
John"J
Keerthana, I'm telling you it's urgent And you keep wasting my time now
Take my stuff to the cabin
Keerthu's number is 9884473882
MOTOR!
Add a +91 before it
Come on, there's work to be done What are you doing here?
Thanks, boss
Like a gorilla gorging on guava!
Don't embarrass me in public
Eat decently
Dude...

She gave me her phone number
Then...make your move
She introduced Bushan to me
- Purushan (husband)?

Do you know why she is pushing you away now?
That's what puzzles me
Because she doesn't want you
Why are you grabbing my shirt?
Grab her husband's shirt
- Bushan...!

How many films you've seen directed by Selvaraghavan?
Chase him away and fill in the space
We'll help your love
- What do you say?

- You?

Look how Africa and Japan are signing the same treaty!
Dude, he is Bushan
He looks like a 'bow-buggly'
What gun timing!

What is my excuse to hit him?
If you're spoiling for a fight there can be only 2 reasons!
If he looks at you and says 'Hey!

If he says 'Hi da!

How can we break our own rule of not fighting for a girl?
True, rule is don't fight for a girl But you can fight for your life!
I'm not convinced, dude
'Brother'...!
"This used to be my-"
"This used to be my play ground"
What?
"This used to be my pride, John!"
Enough,da Hit him
Dude!

What do you mean 'dude'?
You finish your business I'll wait for you near the car
Back-stabber!
Keerthu...

Calling her to your cabin, eh?
Works in a software company and 'Uncle Scrooge'!

Keep it for booze tonight
He's 2-timing, da
He has another photo here
You're 2-timing, huh?
Wait...wait, dude
He's trying to say something
Looks like a piece of chalk and you'll sing like Madonna, huh?
(Garbled sound)
His chin is slightly cork-screwed, that's why
Speak up clearly now
Photo is my wife
Keerthu is my wife's best friend
Sister-type
Why is he saying wife's sister...?
You mustn't cry
What do you prefer?

0kaaay...you must not complain to your mom at home
Or bring someone to threaten us
Good boy...go
Dude, why did you hit a dumb herbivore like that?
Are you happy now?
I'm very happy
Come on, let's play
Throw the ball
Hey...!
Are you a scumbag?
Why do you use me as an excuse to start a fight?

I don't like you one bit
That's why I lied to you...so what?
Isn't this why you hounded me like a dog?
Don't ever set eyes on me again
Dai!

Tell me how to hook her, dude
Tell me...!
Okay...okay
Don't cry now
Do I have a choice?
Am la drunkard...?
Am I an alcoholic?
DRUNKARD?
Then what...are you a kulfi-ice seller?
Just drink
She made me step into a wine shop!
Why should she keep her uncle's cheque in her bag and make you run behind her?
Use your brain cells
Yea!
When he isn't her boy friend why show a nincompoop and claim he's her boy friend
On top of everything 'brother'...!
Why call you so?
You have to think...deeply
What should I do now?
That's the right question my precious friend!
First drink this
Listen to what it says and follow instructions implicitly
It's not giving any clue
Keep it in your ear It will whisper to you
Don't let go of her, dude Create a ruckus at her doorstep!
It is asking me to create a ruckus in front of her house
Yes!

Leave now...on your march!
Dude, I don't know any swear words at all
That's easy
All you have to do is keep repeating it
You'll automatically decipher it!
Follow my instructions faithfully
I'll compose more words on the way for you
Stop...don't you know Keerthana's house?
You leave, there's a huge uprising about to happen
You can play ball later
Come here
Have you ever been in love?
Have you ever had your nose cut?

I've been royally snubbed after falling in love, brother
Why do girls exist in this world, brother?
But I've told the girl I love 'you are my whole world'
Idiot!
If a girl cries, it means she's taking you for a ride
If a guy cries, it means he has been taken for a ride, bro!
Why are you crying?
Did Julie take you for a ride too?
Julie and Keerthana are 2 peas in the same pod, brother
Don't share this with Keerthana, Caesar!
Dirty fellow!
Come inside
If you don't come in now you can be with him forever
What audacity!
Dogs of the same kind share the same mind!
Let me see you get out
Where are you dragging me to?
Duuuuude!

- Who is this?

I'm Keerthana speaking
Wow!

Sorry for the disturbance
You dumb-ass!

Come and take him
Correct I understand
But...who will take me home?
Maybe I'm the dumbo!
'What are you doing now?

'Coffee...?

'We are late for the movie'
'The boys who came this morning'
'I believe that cheque got torn'
'If they come again give this to them'
'I'm out of town for a week'
'Muah!

'Uncle will be back only next week'
'Get lost!

'Leave now'
'Go...!

Come on, guys
Lift...

Yea!
Watch your step
He must have got drunk
And then landed here because it looked familiar
Don't hold it against him
Yes?
Ask him to come and meet me at 5:00 p.m
- Where?

Okay
Good morning, dude
You can take it back It's evening now
Do you know all the 'John-foolery' you did?

We went, drank and got back into bed
I carried you back into your bed, da!
What was I up to then?
Whole night you were in that girl's house and-
Dude, I didn't cross my limit-
Don't go overboard
She had tied you next to her Caesar
I untied you and brought you back
She said she wants to meet you at 5:00 p.m
How can I go without you, dude?
Let's go
Hey...wait...waaaait!
On normal days, she'll bug you with her 'brother' dialog
She's angry now, to top it all I'm sure she'll call you 'father'!
Hey!
Why grab my shirt?

Don't drag me indecently in front of all these girls
Sorry, sister!
The day you told me you've got a boy friend I should have stepped away
My fault
I'm extremely sorry, sister
Let's go, dude
Heyyy!

I can't take this
I'm 'sister' to you now, huh?
You'll follow me like a lost puppy
You'll hit the chap I claim as my 'boy-friend'
You'll flash all your 32 teeth and smile
After all this, you will call me 'sister', huh?
You are no better!

You'll get mad if I talk to some other girl
To add to this list, you've lied to me, you have a boy friend
If after all that you did you can call me 'brother' why can't I give you a taste of your own medicine?

Hit him with that glass
Hold this
Do you want something bigger?
Let me hunt
"0day...oday...oday oh!"
"Oday...0day...oday oh!

Will this do?
Before I could raise my head you are stuck to each other like a mini van banging into a stationary lorry
Sweetheart, get me the cheque
Get lost
"Mr love-bro, that's me My heart's a wee bit wacky"
"Ah!

"South, west, east...to me all directions topsy-turvy"
"Flat out...

"if I'm called 'Mr Love' by everybody don't take it too literally"
"Don't dismiss me as a 'missed call' disdainfully"
"0day...oday...oday oh!"
"Oday...0day...oday oh!

"Miss Brave-heart, glowing For 183 days, I'm following"
"Heart changed to love-flowing on my bended knees I'm going"
"With this love-glutton being only glances borrowing"
"Thank God no blues incoming Now at last love outgoing"
"Equal half...or devil's avatar?"
"Sweet as sugar but savage monster"
"0day...oday...oday oh!"
"Oday...0day...oday oh!

"Hey bambini...!"
"Bambino...baby"
"Prince Charming"
"Princess Fascinating"
"My princess so captivating"
"When memory everlasting neurons merrily enjoying"
"into wide-awake eyes lancing porcelain cheeks shadow-dancing"
"In the soul song a-hearing Love in a milk-feeder nurturing"
"Long friendship recharging As breath in the lungs regulating"
"Don't scream or scorch me incorrigible...creatures are we"
"Mr love-bro, that's me My heart's a little loony"
"Ah!

"South, west, east...to me all directions topsy-turvy"
"Flat out...

"if I'm called 'Mr Love' by this city don't take it as reality"
"Don't dismiss me as a 'missed call' derisively"
"0day...oday...oday oh!"
"Oday...0day...oday oh!

What do you like?
Why?
Tell me
You are the reason for it
How about a beer?
Wait...wait...wait!
Why?
3-2-1-open!
- What?

Happy birthday
Thank you, brother
Cheers!
John, my granny used to say
If you look at the full moon and lie on your mom's lap and wish it will come true Have you heard of it?
- Huhmm!

Who should consent for you to marry me?
My parents and Sarathy, that's all
But I don't have to ask anyone
Just my consent is enough
Why won't you ask your parents?
Only if they are alive!
No sympathy, please
My parents died when I was really young
I grew up in an orphanage
I got a scholarship
Then a good job...

I just felt like sharing a slice of me with you
But John...
If our loved ones leave our world doesn't mean it's the end of the world!
Some day, according to our wish-list our life will change
It has changed for me
You think and let me know
I've never slept on my mother's lap
Shall I?
I told you I'm in a meeting
Then why do you plague me with calls?
Okay, let's go
Meeting...don't you understand?
Okay, shall I bring my bag then?
Why did you bring me here?
Isn't it your birthday?
Go in and pray
You also come with me
I don't want to come, you go
Get lost!
Changed your mind?
Even I don't have to wait for anyone's consent
I decided on the day I professed my love to you
You are my wife
Let's wait for a while
As soon as I get a job I'll myself tell my mom
Till then make sure you don't tell Sarathy
Bye
Actually it's our wedding night
I'd have agreed to spend the night with you even before we got married!
Not like that...now that I'm married I have more responsibilities
I need a job and a home of our own
And I also need a lifetime to love you!
Thinking of all this, I don't know if I can sleep tonight!
But I'll sleep peacefully tonight
I used to lie awake half the night, thinking who is there for me!
Now you are here as my 'equal half'!
How can you go away like this?
Brother...your wife will be on your bike hugging you tight tomorrow
Then you can ask her for this kiss, now your wife is off to sleep
Stop...stop...stop Ice cream
What do you want?
- Beer

You have to ride your bike, no?
Tell me 1 minute
Good afternoon
My name is Sarathy I hope you remember me
Whose number is this?
As if you are picking my calls!
I am with Keerthana I'll talk to you later
Honking with your mouth to give the impression you're driving
Talking in a husky voice as if you are in a meeting
Copyright for all these tactics belong to me, so don't fool me
Talk to Sarathy He doesn't believe me
Hello, bro
How are you, dear?
I am good
Where are you off to?
Just down East coast road
Why this sudden outing?
Newly weds 1st time outing
Hey!
We didn't know where to go...so just like that
You are married?

In the temple, yesterday
He told me not to tell you
Forget...forget...forg-
Let me talk to him
He wants to talk to you
Lunafic!
I'll get the ice cream for us Eat whatever flavor I choose
Tell me, dude
Are you a human being?
- She was just kidding

- Brother...?

You can't turn back the clock, da No use coming to this spot every year
There's life after this, da
Go away
Go and tell them I am not interested in this wedding
Why don't you?

Tell your parents everything and live in your past lifelong
You can't do that...right?
Either you be happy or make them happy
You know you can't be happy
Why make them miserable?
Sadist!
John, if you think there is no life after losing your love no one will be alive after 25 years, da
Only you and I know you were married
Please, da
Half the people do not marry according to their wish but still, don't they live?
When you want to really live, you can start your life then
To what extent a boy has loved a girl...!
The fact you've told me this please do not tell John
Even if I'm not drunk I'll forget whatever I spoke in the morning
And I am so drunk now You don't have to worry
Let me tell you this before I go
If a man drinks after falling in love ...it is love-failure
If he drinks after he is married ...his whole life is a failure
Take care
John is in the car
I'll put him on his bed and leave
Sorry, Regina
If the one we love most dearly leaves us and this world it doesn't mean it is the end of the world!
Someday, according to our wish-list, our life will also change
It is changed for me
I'll wait till it changes for you
Church Father!

In front of this gathering, John, do you agree to wed Regina?
Double okay
Dear?
Dear...!

You smile so beautifully in my dream
Why don't you smile in real life?
Get up, dear
I've made coffee for you
John...do you wake up late in the mornings?
He is always a late-riser
Only I know what I go through sending him to work...!
Aiyaiyo!

Shower quickly Dad is waiting
Let's all eat together
Why do you keep looking at me?
Dad is waiting, no?
You need to be pampered Come out double quick
Isn't she going overboard on her drama queen act?

As usual, you forgot to take your towel in
All our neighbors have come Your friend Sarathy is also here
They want to talk to you it seems
Don't keep them waiting for too long
She's got some ace up her sleeve
Panchayat confirmed!
- Happy birthday, uncle!

- Happy birthday, dude

Why are you staring?

Happy birthday, dear John
Cut it, dude
Why should I cut it?
Let's celebrate without cutting the cake
- Okay, dude?

How do we eat if you don't cut it?
Get a ladle and scoop it up like 'sweet pongal' in the temple
Shutup!

Cut the cake
Isn't everyone waiting?
Go ahead...cut
What is this, dear?

John, don't open this in front of everyone
It's something I searched and got specially for you
See it when you're alone
Dad, let's all take a snap 1 photo, please
Come!

Come closer
ls your official Mrs back or is it still your office miss in action-
This is my daughter
Happily married, John?

Going late for work
Happy man, huh?
Nothing like that, uncle
John, has my daughter ever bought beer for you?
Why, uncle?

Would you prefer if she drank vodka, so you could join in?
Dudenl
That's not it, Sarathy
Whenever she wants something from me she bribes me with a beer That's why I asked
You'll decently stop with 1 beer
But our man needs an entire case!
Will you shut up, please?
Has my daughter never bought you beer then?
No, uncle
He's trying to subtly ask you for a beer?
Yo...you should open the gift
Oh...yes
But she was emphatic you must open it only when you're alone
Sorry, uncle I forgot
Bloody gift!
Hey!
Go outside and play
I have never been unfaithful to my wife even in my mind!
Did you see the gift?
I saw it, uncle
So did I...!
- Darling?

I'm going to Germany for 3 months on a project
Okay
I'll definitely come home when I get back here
- Okay, dad

I'll come down
I'll see you
- I'll come down too, uncle

Thanks, John
Dad?
You're happy, aren't you?
How can I not be?

Dad?
It's okay if you act out of love for me
But why is John also acting?

Regina, this is your house
This is your life
- Dad, you've misunderstoo-

Just think about it carefully
Bye, Regi
Dude, what's up with her?
In the hospital she didn't want to accept me as her husband
And now?
Why are you so tensed?
She's 'Drama queen' personified in front of her father, dude
You've forgotten your towel, drink coffee, cut the cake...!
Have you told her you love her?
You haven't, right?
Then why do you expect her to say it?
That's how a normal couple behave, da
She doesn't like living with me, bro
Did she say that to you?
Don't you understand as yet?
She wants a divorce from me
John!
What problem?

Nothing, sir Small family problem
We'll take care, sir You go, sir
What family problem?

We will discuss
Why should we talk about our family problem at his house?
I've been searching for you everywhere and you're here!
Just a little confused
What?
Sometimes things we accept are too difficult to be expressed, no?
I don't get you
At least I only heard he passed away!
He watched her die in front of his eyes!
If he's ready to change himself to lead a new life, all over again why can't I?
Super!

But you've got the transfer you applied for to Australia
2 years
It's your call now
I'll send you the ticket
Think about it
Good evening, guys I got stuck in traffic
Wait for 2 minutes
Hi, honey!

He howls like a wolf!
Doesn't the servant also resemble our managing director?
You're right, dude
I am your boss Henry Can't you recognise me?
Sorry, sir
Sit...sit
You went up as Mr Henry like an anchor in a reality show
Now you come down in a lungi looking like a guava seller
This is the original me Do I look local enough?
What are you saying?
We could force feed 300 kids by showing them your scary face
- No, dude?

I meant such a local face
- Funny guys!

Shanthi, is my fried fish from Vyasarpadi ready?
This is my favorite item
The maid?
The fish, you idiot
Help yourself
Sir, you called us home
I was a chain snatcher
Huh...

- Sir...?

I failed 10th grade twice because lessons never got into my head
Even lice will slide off your head How will lessons sink in?
Wait, let me finish
I'd go to Besant Nagar to steal chains
Once as I was snatching a chain I saw the girl's face
And instantly I got trapped
By the police?
Listen, man The girl trapped me!
Those days, I didn't even know how to say 'I love you'
I told her 'I like you a lot'
You know what she said?
'Take your hands off my chain Pass 10th grade and we'll see'
I passed 10th grade I went and met her
She said, 'Finish your MBA...'
'Then I'll marry you'
I somehow finished that too and went and saw her again
They got us married
That's when I found out her dad owned our store
Owner?
He gave me his girl on a golden platter as well as his office keys to me
Why I'm sharing all this is my life started the day I told her I loved her
When you profess your love loudly, your life will start too
Don't bottle up your feelings That doesn't get you anywhere
Hope you heard that!
Drink some alcohol
Sir...my wife doesn't like it
Super!

Dude...?
Sir, I'm not yet married
Can I...ah...?
Sarathy
Your life and wife will never start
Madam isn't picking up the phone
- Try again

Sir, someone from madam's office
What is it?
I need to give ma'am this cover
I'll give it to her
You...?
Husband
'U.S, Australia, even if it is Somalia, I'm okay with it'
'I just want to leave this place, that's all
You didn't drink today?
I thought you don't like it if I drink...!
You want a beer?
'When my daughter wants something from me...' '...she'll always bribe me with a beer'
'She wants a divorce, da'
How do I start?
John...?
You want a divorce from me, right?
You don't like being with me?
I'll give it to you
It's not that
I'm going to Australia
From this morning I was wondering how to tell you
I went to the shop myself and bought you the beer
It's nothing You drink
"Eye and eyelid...parts of a whole Now severing...out of control"
"When idea dawns of you and me as we just then dream dissolves abruptly"
"Will the sun shine to renew the path covered with dew?"
"Tender words, can you hear spoken by your heart, dear?"
Did you want to say something else and did I jump to wrong conclu-
You were right...

Into my soul you percolated Drop by drop you relocated"
Will you drop me at the airport tomorrow, or shall I-
Why are you angry?
When I'm even giving you a divorce...won't I drop you?
Good night
"into my heart you pervaded In units of time you saturated"
I can do it myself
Regina...?
Did you pack all your tablets?
Regi...?
Bye
Did you tell her?
I didn't...she left
Me and you, you and me Everything is over, that's all
Listen!

Yov!

Move, man
What the hell's your problem, da?
- John...?

- Where are you?

Will you come up to the entrance, please?
I'll be there
Tell me
Upstairs...at the immigration counter
Surya...?
Surya...!
Excuse me, will you leave way for the next person in the line?
Next please
Surya
Don't cry I'll talk to him
Hey...!
Sir...

Tell me
You know Regina, don't you?
When you were working in customer care on a wrong call you both got connected
You went to the US and she got the news you committed suicid-
Who are you?
John
Who are you to her?
Her husband
I'm married, sir
As soon as I saw her do you expect me to ask 'Hi Regina, shall we get married?

I don't mind sharing this with you
My dad clobbered me and sent me off to USA
I flew with fear in my heart
I thought that was the end of my life and love
After all 'love-failures' there is life, brother
There is a good life waiting for everyone
I agree, I miss her What can I do about-
I know very well she cannot forget me
That's why I asked my friend to tell her I am dead
I don't know if everyone is lucky enough to marry the person they love
But the one you marry you can definitely fall in love with
Sir, if you don't mind I can talk to your wife
Get on with your life
He just walked away as I was talking to him
Do you think you are a hero?
He is dead, right?
Till now you've never heard what I wanted to say, right?
You'll get it all wrong and act on it stupidly
I wanted to open my heart to you, that night
And you asked if I wanted a divorce!
Today I told you I saw Surya
You fall at his feet shamelessly
Who will think of reuniting?
You and I can never be compatible
If only you had opened this gift that night we wouldn't be standing here like this
'Don't open this in front of everyone'
'It's something I searched and got specially for you'
Regina...wait for me
Get lost!
There will be some village bumpkin Kanimozhi or Thenmozhi waiting for you
Go behind her and woo her
I'm not the right girl for you
Stop
I'm not scared of my dad
I love you
Brother...

You take care of the cooking I'll go see who is at the door
Hi...is John in?
Yes
How many times have I told you not to call him home?
If you ask him to stay for dinner I'll make mincemeat out of you!
Who has come?
What's up, dude?
I'm getting married
Invitation You must be there
Where are you going?
She has made biriyani for you
Stay for dinner Or else she'll be angry
How, dude?
Even if Mr Big-shot to the outside world you are Mr Broomstick at home!
My best friend, da!
