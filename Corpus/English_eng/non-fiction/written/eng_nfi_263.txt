♪♪
We're here, girls!
Wow, Professor!
Is this where you used to stay
- when you were little?

The old Utonium family cabin.
Just like I remember it.
Perfect for a rugged mountain man like me!
Ah-choo!
Excuse me.
The pollen count must be affecting your allergies.
I'm too rugged for allergies.
Aw, man!

I bet it's teeming with sea monsters!
Oh, sorry, Buttercup...

Aww.
But there is one famed giant crawdad!
Old One Claw McCraw!
Legend has it he sold one of his claws to Poseidon himself for eternal glory.
Hundreds flock here to try and catch him, but nobody has...

I'm not a fisherman.

Even I tried to catch him when I was a kid, but I never succeeded.
Ha!

I must catch this phantom crawdad and avenge my father!
I'm still here, Buttercup.
You will be avenged!
Who shall join me on this expedition?

Hup!

Excellent, Bubbles!

Ready to set sail?
"Aye-aye!" And, yes!
Onward!
While they're doing that,
I'll navigate this historic lake, with my "Bookworm's Guide to the Outdoors."
You don't need a book...

Ah, the majestic mosquito.
Hello, little fella.
Ow!
Uh-oh.

"To enjoy your stay in mosquito country, spray early and spray often with bug repellant."
Nonsense!

Come and get me, fellas!
Ow!
Breaking it in!
Buttercup:

The seas were rough and tough and also... gruff!
But nothing could distract me from...
Whee!

I can't wait to meet Mr. Crawdad... and then put him safely back in the lake.
After we high-five, of course.
Bubbs, if we throw it back in the water, how are people gonna know we caught it and write a rock opera about us?
Here's what we're gonna do...

And, "B," we're gonna show that crawdad... and my rad muscles off.
I can see it now.
Buttercup!

What are you gonna do next?
More like, what are you gonna do next?
- Ooh, burn!

Catching an endangered animal will definitely prove to the world how cool I am.
But catching the crawdad, that's so mean.
The seas are mean, Bubbs.
So you gotta be mean back.
You never know what surprises they have for you.
Girl:

Huh?
Ahoy, bottom-feeders!
Morbucks, what are you doing here?
Oh, my family has a summer house here... by which I mean, we move my house here for the summer.
Well, get out of our way!
We're on a noble quest to catch the legendary One Claw McCraw!
Well, get in line, 'cause I'm getting that crawdad!
A creature that rare deserves to be caught by me!
And my crew always gets me what I want.
Muscle Woman, status update!
Nothing rare yet.
And I would know...

I just run the general store!
By the way, you should really get that hole in your boat fixed.
What hole?
- Aah!

Hmm, that one!
Y-Y-Yo!
Let's reapply our sunscreen for fun-screen!
Good idea!

Professor, are you sure you don't want some lotion for those bites?
Uh, no, thanks, Blossom.
These leaves should soothe me... the natural way.
S-S-So s-s-s-soothing!
Whoa!
I found a shortcut.

Um, Professor, my guidebook says you should never leave the trail when hiking.
Oh, sweetie, that guidebook is for people who don't have nature flowing through their veins.
That way.
Gah!

Found a bear trap!
Good thinking, First Mate Bubbs.
Glad I always carry
Triple Bubble Double Bubble gum with me!
Oh, my gosh!

Be sure to get my good side, Bubbs.
All right, McCraw, here... we go!
I got it!

Hmm.

Bubbles, it is an old boot.
You can't evade me forever, One Claw McCraw!
My dearest sister Blossom,
I know not how long it has been since I and my first mate Bubbles took to the high seas in search of the single-clawed beast.
He has evaded us at every turn.
I may never know, dear sister, but should you find this letter, please send help... or, at least, cookies.

"Sincerely yours, Captain Buttercup."
Well, sounds like the girls have been having fun these past two hours.
Hmm?

Professor!

I found the bear!
And a mountain lion!
Uh-oh!
I know you're out there, One Claw McCraw... taunting me, teasing me.
You've taken all my bait...

I need something to lure you in.
♪ La la la la la, la la la la la ♪
I have an idea.
♪ La la la la la ♪
Oh!

Why are you...
- Give me one of them pigtails!

What are you
- talking about!

Stop disobeying orders!
Captain Buttercup, can we go back to the cabin?
I don't want to catch the crawdad anymore.
You're acting crazy.
Crazy, am I?

Is it crazy to stare into the endless abyss of the night and cry out to the angsty void, "Caw-ca-chaw!"?
Kinda.
Fine.

But that crawdad is mine!
And when I catch him, I'll make him pay!
No!

It's mean and wrong!
Just try and stop me.
Ha-ha!

I'm gonna reel him in and hang him on my wall!
No!

No, he's mine!
- Aah!

Thanks, losers!
Morbucks, give that back!
I caught it fair and square!
Oof!
What?

Nah nah, nah nah, nah, nah.
Pbht!
Huh?
Got him!

Soon you'll be...

Aw, yeah!
Better luck next time!
Yeah... for you!
Guess again!
Mr. McCraw, wait!
I'm trying to he...

Thanks for...
Cash Money Crew, get that craw...
Don't think so, Lame-Bucks.
Ha-ha!
Aw, yeah!
I did it!

I caught One Claw McCraw!
I am a legend!
I have captured the fabled beast that so many others... have come here to this lake to see, because... 'cause... you're a legend.
Oh, man.

I can't take you away from this place!
Morbucks:

♪♪
♪♪
No more messing around!
For realsies!
Ch-chiggity check it, yeah!
Yo yo yo!

Yeah!

Bubbles, get out of here!
Now, as I was saying... give me that crawdad!
No, Morbucks!

Listen to me!

It's wrong!
Like I care!
Catching a legend like that will bring me the fame that I so richly deserve!
Huh?
Wait!

Ooh!

Y-Y-Yo, that looks like Bigfoot!
Whoa!

Uh-oh, Blossom's gaining on it!
Oh, no, you don't, Blossom!
I saw it first!
Keep your crawdad!
I got bigger fish to fry!
Buttercup, I heard what you said to Morbucks.
I'm so proud of you!
Thanks, Bubbs.

Bubbles:

One Claw McCraw back in the lake.
And I'm really glad Morbucks and her crew figured out you weren't Bigfoot, Professor.
This trip was exhausting.
I don't know, Professor.
I'd say this trip was a lot like One Claw McCraw...
Legendary!
