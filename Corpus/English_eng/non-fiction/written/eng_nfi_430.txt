Why are there ways to avoid it?
So are those damned pills?

- Because it's my body and I decide.

But I'm not nobody.
And I do not want to have children.
There are already enough children Without parents and neglected.
I prefer to provide them before To give birth to a child in this world
I like less and less.
Think about what I told you.
In brackets,
They never told you Are you a bit old?
How can I not be old?
I was born in the sixteenth century, holy numbers!

Over time, everything will come.
I need a mission now!
What you need is one A bit of patience, Lola.
We have to leave.
Yup.
I'm sorry.

- What was that?

Fuck, ugly writing Which has Angustias.

973 of 1982 and goes to Torrelodones.
Well, so we take a walk, huh?
Today you are not very logging.
I'm never.
No, it's true.
Here she is.
You are worried that you will not assign missions to Lola.
No.
It's Pacino who worries me.

Let's go.
I lowered the guard.

How many serve it until you understand it.
- Did not he attack you?

The weapon has fallen, I have grabbed it, I am Went to pick up the gun and she ran away.
That's all.
Let me go to 1982.

No.
I have appointed Ernesto and Irene To go to the Ministerio in 1982
To see if they find it Something that can help us.
- But Ernesto and Irene ...

And thank you for not suspending it Without pay, huh, why ...
Excuse me.
Yup.
Carrasco, I hope you do not call me Complain about his new destination.
I might, but that is not the case.
I need a patrol
At 1605  in Valladolid.
- Something happened?

It is the year of signing the treaty Of peace between Spain and England.
They tried to poison the English mess.
Yesterdaytherealchefhas Made of dishes ...
Somethingspecial.
Stop there!
Stupid.
Do not you see that the decoration is missing?
I should kick her ass.
Leave the plate next to it To the English Admiral.
And announce the dish Like savoy cakes
Of liver bites.
I got it?
The aroma of the liver
Must inhale the diners.
On.
Thedishescamebackamomentlater Without being even tried.
British curse!
My dogs have more taste for them.
And that's what I found this morning.

- Are there any witnesses?

Yes, yes, of course, I understand, I understand.

Agree.
Locate me on the patrol.
Pacino,
Do not make new casinos.
Of course, boss.
What faces.

We see Amelia, you know who he was In Valladolid at this time?
Of course he knows it.
Lope, Cervantes, Quevedo, Góngora ...
- well, and many more.

People like to change air.
More than he liked the Duke of Lerma.

He was the king's trusted man.

Where he had many lands And sold them in gold.
He made a big real estate deal.
Then he repeated the operation.
He bought land in Madrid with Little and enriched by selling them
When the court returned 5 years later.
Among that, the sale of goods
And the traffic of influence, became The richest man in the empire.
We believe we are very much Modern and know everything, but
In this country there are thieves from an eternity.
There are not enough Money for all these thieves.
It was Elena's sentence.
How's your story, Don Miguel?
Good.
Good.
But it came to my ear ...
Which will be represented by one Comedy in honor of the English.
- We must celebrate the peace treaty.

True?
Desire expressed by the queen.
I moved to Valladolid Following the royal family,
And I found only a river Smelly and a cold dog.
What else should I do to do it?

I should farm with her Little girls, like Lope?
They always represent the same.
Indeed, the same.
There was no competition To choose the work.
You are the first of any competition.
You are the author of the magnificent Don Quixote de La Mancha.
You know, it took only three months To finish the first edition.
Congratulations, I am convinced that the Your chronicle will have no comparisons.
I'm not convinced.
I think Lope would write it in Way closer to the queen's taste.
- And I could present my work To the English.

Your job is to To write this story enough.
All right.
I will write the report.
But...
I have to ask you something.
You...
Do you want to ask me a favor?
Among the British who will attend To the function, there is a writer.
One who makes a whore at Phenics of Dramatisks.
The greatest author of England.
Guillermo Shakespeare.
I need to know it.
All right.
If this...
English with the imprinting surname Will be with the admiral, I will present him.
Fantastic.
- You were not in the ...

- Yup.

I asked for a transfer at an epoch Quieter for seniority, and I got it.
Well, then someone wants to break the A treaty of peace between Spain and England?
Yes and if it will succeed it will be Ruin of our country.
Yes, but why?
However, the tests are no longer required Of history for the agents of the Ministry.
- What test?

The treaty ended A 20-year war.
And he allowed Spain to be one Sea power for another century.
Because England pledged to Interrupt pirate actions,
And in return Spain committed itself to Not to protest Protestants only for religion.
- In addition to opening up English business To the Spanish Indies.

They bowed.
If they had to compete with England, Better to do it with merchants than with pirates.
- Is not the same thing?

Who prefers the war to peace?
Anyone who manufactures weapons.
Or the Dutch.
In the treaty, England renounces to help The Flanders in the fight against Spain.
Or many Spanish nobles, like Lerma, who Do not forget the English affairs in the sea.
As I do.
I brought the chronicle of the facts To predict what's going on.
- The Spaniards landed in Coruña A week ago, right?

And they've been in the capital for four days.
I do not know who she is or when she is Here the one who wants to kill them.
- If he has tried us once, he will do it again.

Your uncle went north to fight And left me this problem.
- My uncle?

"You will be the new lady of the queen.

You will accompany the English Commitee.
But...
Here, my English is very basic.
Beer,morebeer...  cocktail,kissme .
Thetoiletteplease,nicebutt .
My goodness!
- Pacino, you have to teach me.

Admiral Howard knows Spanish.
Fury to attack Spanish, learned it.
He was the leader of the fleet He sank our Invincible Army.
And then he conquered and He sacked the city of Cadiz.
- We really have to protect This asshole?

And do not let him notice the danger.
Here, they finally woke up.
I present them.
Take them to the tavern, Also accompany them to the bathrooms.
And tomorrow wear warm clothes, You go hunting with them.
In this land does one Cold winding the soul.

It's normal.
I just came from Genoa.
Your spanish is perfect.
I think I want to eat.
Take it.
Forgive me if I tried it.
I have to keep my eyes open.
Because Duke of Lerma exploits any An opportunity to send me ladies who control me.
But you are the queen.
Sometimes I think Lerma Both the king and us his servants.
The duke kept me hidden.
It makes everyone believe it I'm a jealous mad.
And instead, the king ...
Goes hunting.
But one day I will prove their abuses.
I'm really sorry about this, Majesty.
Can I help you somehow?
I'm content to me Bring a chamomile.
A moment, a moment.

All up.
- All up.

- Everything down.

My men have no experience.
I learned to love Cold beer in Cadiz.
Come on, there's no comparison.

You're just funny.
Sorry.
You can not get in here.
I am the new lady of the queen And wants a chamomile.
Sorry.
I finish this recipe and I will serve you.
What do you write?
A book of recipes.
Now the theater is fashionable, The novel, poetry.
They're all nonsense.
But I have a vision.
What will be fashionable in the future
Will be the book of recipes.
I prepare the chamomile.
These days I have no respite.
What happens?
With the English at court you can not do it.
They are more than two hundred.
And support servers are Worse than a calamity.
Have you had any problems with one of them?
Do you know how it is called?
I bet it's stupid either The name and "idiot" the last name.
Well...
What did he expect?
She had brown hair and Thin and open forehead.
The bags are obvious.
His cheeks dropped.
And the sad expression.
- Do you remember someone?

Amelia:"Guance went down And sad expression ".
"Clear bags, brown hair Fine and discreet front ".
Angustias:"Received, good luck."
News from Amelia?
He just sent me the Description of a suspect.
The steps to Velázquez for an identikit.
Do you know something about Ernesto and Irene?
Not yet, boss.
Good.
We recruited Marta Sañudo three ...
Yes, three years ago.
- I can?

Thank you.
Born in 1945.
- In 1982 he is 37 years old.

Here, we needed somebody Expert in al-Andalus.
And she was the first of her Class in history and geography.
He graduated with praise at that time.
It has never been found Nothing suspicious?
No.
If you want the truth
The only one who did It was Pacino nervous.
If you could leave it in 2017
For us it would be much better.
- There's more?

We need reports Of the cases assigned to Marta.
Her clinical records And his personal belongings.
Encarna, please go to the office.
You can accompany these gentlemen to the Dressing rooms and opening the cupboard of Marta Sañudo?
They are allowed to take What they find.
Sure, do you want to follow me?
With pleasure.
Look look.
Monsieur, look.
Look at her a little.

Are we in the 80s or in the Pleistocene?
All his.
Thank you.
Do you recognize anyone in this photo?
Yup.
That's Martha.
Ramiro Cruz.
Very beautifull.
San Segundo.
And Pacino.
Pacino.
Shame has gone.

Even though it is now up to you Enjoy some of it, do not you?
Now that's finally alone.
The bachelor of gold.
I apologize.
Do you recognize anyone in this other?
Well, just Marta, they will be personal photos.
Thank you.
Oh, my Lord.
- In 1982 no one knows much about Marta, It looks like a lie.

No one knows much about her.
Yes, it's true.
- Thankfully we have enough material.

- To be more efficient we could count on Lola, so it will feel useful.

At the appropriate time, the I will assign myself a mission.
At the moment...
I just want you and Irene on the case.
How are you?
I should ask it.
Nothing important.
And you got something?
Yup.
Marta's birth certificate Is false, it was not born in 1945.
Look...
These two photographs When I zoom in.
It is the same face.
- It's photoshopped.

- It looks like we're waiting for a long night.

That's what I was referring to, sir.
Up in the ass!
Here's my boyfriend, that's the spirit.
Very good.
Thank you, Beatrice.
Why are you smiling?
For your goodness.
There are not many queens in history Who thank their ladies.
Before being one Queen, I'm a person.
And I before I was one Ladies are grateful and flattered.
- I swear.

The men do that They do not keep their promises.
Can I ask you a favor?
For me it's an order.
They say Queen Isabella is Catholic She ordered her ladies to sleep with her.
Yes, I heard it.
It seems he did it for not being Accused of infidelity with King Ferdinand.
Can you spend the night with me?
Do not do strange ideas.
I do not do it to prove to be loyal To my husband.

I just want to sleep ...
Knowing to have someone next door.
I just want you to tell me Stories, a story.
As if I were a little girl.
"Hepassedabullandsaid...
Formichina, formichina, do you want to marry me?
"How will you make me fall in love", The dummy answered.
The bull began to jerk.
The ants stuck on them Ears with their paws.
"Keep on your way," he said To the bull. "I'm scared,  and so much ...
And?"
"Much".
At the end...
Foreigners come to Spain for him Same motives, whatever the century.
To drink, to swallow ...
But really, fuck.
Like in the Golden Age, fuck.
My mom.
You will see that tomorrow we have to continue To protect that Warhol.
Warhol?
Howard.
- Is there any problem.

Yes, you have a problem.

- You can tell me, Alonso.

- Let's see, is it for the time?

- Yes, it is the era, by force, Brings you memories.

- But if it's a century ago.

You know that you can tell me everything.
All right, listen to me You do not have to have barriers.
- I do not.

- Pacino, let's go to sleep.

- Let's go to sleep.

Look.
That's Lope de Vega.
- I have to talk to him about a question.

Let's go and say goodbye.
Avvertitelo.
Majesty.
- Let me present you ...

No.
We met... time ago.
How small is the world.
How do you know Beatrice?
Beatrice?
"So kind and so honest it seems
My wife, when someone else salutes,
Who is lengua devèn, trembling, mute,
And their eyes do not like to look at it. "
Perfect verses of Dante.
Yup.
I translated them myself.
Beatrice.
Come on, let's talk.
How does my commission proceed?
I'm ending the last scene.
- And the evidence?

We're working, Majesty.
You know, Beatrice,
Tomorrow, in front of the gun, there It will be a manifestation before the king,
The British and the people,
Which will show the poorer side and Villains of our Duke of Lerma.
Yup.
Well... more or less.
Great move to emphasize it.
Observe the duke's reaction well When you see yourself in the perfect corrupt.
Majesty.
We should talk about this title.
Do not you like it?
I...
I would give you a look.
If you have to hit a mouse like Lerma, you might call it ...
"Mousetrap".
Allegorical.
I like it.
All his personal life is a lie.
For sure.
But we can only find the truth In the storage of lies that we have here.
We do not have time.
It's like a lottery.
Play a number on a thousand with The absurd hope they pull that out.
Where's the agenda?
The agenda.
Wait.
Look.
Pope.
If that photo is not his father, who Fuck is there behind this phone number?
Wait.

I do not know the cause of injustice Which afflicts reason.
That is our Majesty the Cause these anxieties?
- It's the ruf ...

The latter verse
It would be much better If you say it with your hand ... so.
On the chest.
Yup.
Thank you, Don Lope.
You are very good.
- Thank you, Don Lope.

That is our Majesty the Cause your anxieties?
It's the ruffian of Valdemart he has Brainwashed to the king.
- Do you recognize him?

He also had this:the kit The good agent of the Ministry.
A cellphone and sheets with Information on the doors of time
- We have to send everything to the Ministry.

It is contradictory.
First this Pully
Collaborates with a faction Progressive Ministry
- to destroy the international reputation of Franco, kidnapping Hitchcock.

And suddenly it belongs To a secret sect
Clerical and super conservative,
Who claims that Catholics and Protestants continue the war.
- Maybe the ring was a booty of war.

Well, the important thing is that Howard is still there Alive and the English have not known anything.
- The peace treaty with England is still there.

For security i ordered the patrol of Stay in Valladolid until the Treaty is signed.
Then Lola can give us a hand.
He knows something about espionage and double agents.
Not yet, Ernesto.
We must first make sure That Lola can change oritis thesameaswe know.
Delicious.
I will print your book of recipes.

I thought "Magister Cicero", "Maestro Cuoco" in Latin.
No, this title has no future.
Why do not you call ...

"Kitchen Art, Confectionery, Confectionery and Preservation "?
It's not a bit too much Long and explanatory?
People do not understand anything if they do not He explains a thousand times, and much less in Latin.
- You called me, Excellency?

Don Félix Lope de Vega.
Do you want to try my pimples?

Not now.

Yes, sir.
You can know that fucking Are you trying?
It was a real mandate.

You want to say a Queen, is not the same.
You know my devotion to you.
Last year I glorified yours Your origins and your business,
In autos sacramentales de "The pilgrim in his homeland."
Your comparing my humble person In St. John the Baptist I was flattered,
- I can not deny it.

You will get popularity by demonstrating Knowing how to accept the derision.
This is how it is done in France and England.
My dear Lope, here we are in Spain.
The people are not ready for such works.
Well...
Satir relieves the people,
So that it can continue to handle The heaviness of its existence.
I do not want anyone to laugh at me!
Excellence...
Laughing Powerful
It is the revenge of the poor.
And so the order remains.
- Very well.

You convinced me, my Dear Lope.

Tomorrow, after the presentation, You will come in my office.
To revoke  sine die  Your theatrical license!
How do you say?
Here at the court, there are too many writers.
Kick a stone and not Winds come out from below.
- But Lord ...

I'll do him a double favor.

And I will offer him to represent Something for His Majesty.
- We only agree with myself I would have known Shakespeare.

The issue of writers ...
Is that you believe it more important Of those who pay you.
- I'll give you my apologies.

Represented "El Caballero But Illescas "and I will do my part.
Entertain the audience, have fun,
And they do not think about it They do not have to think.
It will be so, Excellency.
Ohmydearbride,brightanddivine ,
Light of my senses,
Now we are in Spain.
If we are now, what do you have fear?

There is great pain.
What pain, if we have life?
I can not say it.

Do not insist, letting go.
My lord, I insist.
Rest.

Beatrice.
Amelia.
Whatever your name is, Please, wait!
You have to understand me.
The sword of Damocles Hung on my boss.
Tell me, what can I do?
To be faithful to the queen and to the people, Is what made you rich and famous.
You had a debt with Them and you broke it.
So how did you break it My admiration for you.
Cabbage, that happy eyes.
- Where have you been?

- And you should not be with the British?

The king invited for one Match tourists and Cervantes.
Better to be present, we would not want it That exaggerate, true Alonso?
Be careful.

See you later.
What happens to her?
Power!

Street!

I thought we would have Played at the palace cards.
Here the  Autodafe  are done In the central square,
- and the cards are used in the taverns.

- I've seen you somewhere.

- I do not believe.

Nowhere.
Excuse me.

I live in a hell in which I confuse my faces And mischievous reality and fiction.
Majesty.

Thank you.
Gentlemen, welcome to this game Of cards in honor of the admiral.
Consider the Spanish rematch.
- My dear Duke, do the honors.

- Twenty-one.

Yes, blackjack.
Sorry?
- Blackjack classic, blackjack!

Twenty-one.
So we invented it And they copied it.
As is said in Castile, the movement It proves to be moving forward.
The game is very simple.
Wins the one who comes to Twenty-one without passing.
The game is very simple.

Each card has a value Numeric, except the man, the horse,
And the king, who are worth ten.
And then there is the ace, that Is the most important one,
Since it has a value of 1 or 11, Depending on the convenience.
Excuse me, sir?
Are you William Shakespeare?
Exact.
And you?
It looks like our guests Have had luck.
The luck of the beginner.
I like Ventuno, Majesty.

- I told you.

- There is something wrong.

Get up, English!

Alonso, please!
- Talk to me?

- The Spaniards can not lose.

- Hides something in the sleeve.

I knew it.

- Spanish curse!

Lord.
We retire.

I knew it.
I was a fool.
Think about having a chance with Lerma.
The Duke won this battle, But you will win the war.
You just have to find one Better accomplice than Lope.
I do not blame it.

Thanks for staying with me.
You can trust someone In this golden cage ...
Consoling my soul.
Majesty,
I took the liberty to talk to The English author, William Shakespeare.
I heard he promises good.
- What did you talk to us about?

- And what did he tell you?

They disturbed him so much Who will write a tragedy.
- Really?

Will Lerma denounce it?
It will be called Macbeth.
At least the British They will learn from our mistakes.
I think we might bother you To Lerma with something else.
And, consequently, Lope.
I heard Lope want To know Shakespeare,
As well as Cervantes.
And Lerma will do it That you only talk to Lope.
Can we cancel the signing of the treaty?
- You're out of your mind.

It was not the most Adequate for our interests.
- It was just a game.

You know that the British are Always been our enemies.
But this war must end!
Twenty years have passed.
The people deserve to live in peace.
Think about your father, Peace to his soul.
Remember how much He fought against them,
Everything he suffered when he had to Living on those infamous islands,
Everything she told you about Maria Tudor ...
Remember what you sang?
Sure, I remember.
"I do not want love in England,
Because I have the best in my land.
Ah, God of my land, take me away from here,
Because England is not for me. "
What are you doing here?

You.
Here's how you know the smilzo!
He was with you!

But then you helped me write "Don chisciotte".

I thought it was a dream But now I know it is reality!
What do you want now?

- And who is this?

IS... and he?
Yup.
- Is he really you?

And he wants to talk to you.
- Finally something good In Valladolid.

Do not you know that?
The treaty is no longer signed Of peace with the British,
And I'm not surprised after the Yesterday's hustle and bustle of the card game.
Shakespeare!
Shakespeare.
Shakespeare.

What does that mean Does not Spain sign the treaty?
- This will change the story.

- Did not you know?

- They do not have to know.

Cervantes, said Lerma.

How do you know What are the cards for?
You have the word "Guilty" written in front.
There was a little deal with That Howard, but no blood.
Thank god.

Chronicle is disappearing.
- "Then it was, in that glorious day Of the Corpus of the 1605 ... "

"When Howard insulted the king, The generous Philip III,
And the glorious Duke of Lerma, Thus annulling the signing of the Treaty.
Spain could not afford it Such an affront to Protestants.
If it is war they want, These English infamies,
- war will have. "" Fuck I was complaining about the news ...
- And now what can we do?

If you had not already ruined everything ...
Well, Lerma teased them, and they If they take it, it is not Alonso's fault.
Here I agree.

- nothing like this would happen.

The illuminated people talk to me Almost put to the stake at Trasmoz.
I insist.

- You can not weep On poured milk.

- Thing?

- and you do not They discover nothing.

You do not approach the English.
- Wait in the palace, I'll need you.

Hey!
Very well.
Are you sure of what you say?
Completely, Majesty.
The king refuses to sign the treaty.
It was Lerma, did not it?
Majesty...
You are the only one you can To change the mind to the king.
If I try, that damn of Lerma will never forgive me.
And you need a better reason Of this to try?
Majesty.
We're playing a chess game.
And only the queen can save us.
Thanks for the invitation, but we have to go.
- It's not good to have a king waiting.

In Spain this ceremony is always delayed.

- I'm thirsty, sir.

Let's stay a moment longer.
Host,
Of the other wine!
- Strength, you were lasting.

Margherita, they are service issues, Talk to the butler.
I have too many things for my head.
How to revoke the treaty with the British?
I thought you wanted peace for the Your Empire, for your people.
Margherita, you know I respect you.
But you do not understand state affairs.
You're wrong, my lord.
- It would be better if you sometimes listened Me and not Lerma.

Lerma is a good man.
It is a great patriot.
Be careful of those who They show their patriotism.
Lerma was very good with me.
Actually, when my father demonstrated Not to trust me, he did.
I too trust in you.
You do not need him at your side.
You ask for the impossible.
That's what I'm thanking him.
I have to go, admiral waiting for me Howard and I must give him the bad news.
First greet your son.
It will be a great king.
The best king of all.
There will be a ruined Empire.
A shadow of what it is now.
You really want this For your successor?
My Lord...
Spain has enough open fronts.
It's time to close somebody.
Who loses pay for drinking.
- You can not avoid betting, huh?

Yes Yes Yes!
Do yours!
You must always prove Your superiority.
I think the same thing about the Spaniards.
King, Lerma, your friend Alonso ...

His sword.
She can keep it.
It's not a bad thing to be superior.

Compete in the game ... avoid
Who competes in war.
- Take it off!

It's close.
And who are you to give me orders?

His Majesty the Queen ordered That nobody interrupts it.
And a queen commands more than a duke.
Or should do it.
Guard me!
- What is this hustle?

Does it concern the signing of the treaty?
Inform our guests that soon I'll be there for the final sign.
- Maestà, my advice ...

It seems that everything has gone well.
I think I still have A problem to be solved.
Cervantes!
You will pay dearest for your blandness.
You talked to Shakespeare!
"Shakespeare".

And you angry for so little?
I thought my biggest bumpiness It was to share with you the breath I breathe.
You are the only reporter for this event.

- use it for your benefit!

I'm the Phoenix of Literature.
Elected by the Crown
- to homage our guests.

Rather chicken with garlic, As long as you repeat it.
It will not have a bad taste for the chicken,
Since I replenish all the theaters.
Write what people want Feel, not what you need to know.
Over the centuries,
I will be the symbol of this age, and of you
They will not remember either.
I laugh at this, and already that I am
Laugh at you.
Send that laugh down.
One says one who fought In the great and happy Army.
Defend yourselves.
Here is the one who fought in Lepanto,
The highest and most memorable occasion Seen in the past centuries
- and that future ones hope to see.

- So ugly!

Stop!
What are you doing here?
- It's better if you leave.

- He first started him.

He started him, I swear.
You look like spoiled children.
Explains that will survive yours Works and not your acts, otherwise ... what a shame!
The two most important genes of our literature Who quarrel for those who will enter into glory.
As if there was no room for both of them.
The top is a tight place.
One says he has never set foot.
If I could live with the same freedom Of a man and you had your talent,
I would not waste my time Skirmishes and ridiculous envy.
Give yourself a favor, your lordships.
- No news, sir.

Pacino killed the killer he was standing on To destroy the peace treaty,
That I was about to ruin.

With that english from the last name Unmistakable ...

"But for the rest, everything is perfect, boss.

Yes, because, as they say,
What happens in Las Vegas, Remains in Las Vegas.
And somebody can tell me What happened with Lerma?
It will continue some other year with corruption And will avoid the jail by ordering cardinal.
In fact, the cardinals were privileged.
The queen, with the help of the confessor Real, managed to open an investigation,
But the poor man died shortly thereafter, Without seeing the fall of his enemy.
It was said he was Lerma himself Ordain poisoning.
Good people die Always before the assholes.
Do you know anything about the guy I killed?
Or of Marta?
I assure you that when we know it,
We will tell you first.
An emergency, boss.
Lola escaped from the Ministry.
Are you sure?
Yup.
And they seem to have disappeared from the warehouse Some paintings recovered from Alcázar.
Look a little, it seems he started his Art dealer career before time.
