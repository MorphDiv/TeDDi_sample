No.

They're your family.
(groans) Can't be helped.
Back went out again.
Look, don't worry.

- Go out.

I mean, Colleen is great, but she has to pee every 15 minutes.
And then it's just gonna be me and Matt with nothing to say, except for him, you know, complaining about how all the food on his plate is touching.
Matt is such a baby.

Mmm.

Mmm.

I've never been alone with Jen before.

And, besides, she eats all weird, with all of her food intermingling and everything.
Well, I don't have a choice.

She's been writing her name on sandwiches that aren't even hers.
I wasn't saying the sandwich was mine.
I was saying Doris is the sandwich's name!
You go have dinner with Jen.
- (grunts)

(sniffs)
I have egg salad.
(phone beeps off)
Hey!
Hey!

- (chuckles) This is crazy, huh?

- So Colleen is... she's not coming.

- Not coming.

And Greg, you know, with his back, just lying on the floor like a virgin on her wedding night.
- You know?

- Would you mind?

- it's just my heart breaks for him.

- Yeah.

- a deadline due. so... yeah, but...

- (groans) You know?

- to get some alone time with you.

Me, too.

- let's just, like,

- make a whole night of it.

- Or...

We're gonna make it a weekend.
- How 'bout Vegas?

- (chuckles)

Oh, excuse me.

Uh, my mom's Chinese, my dad is black.
Wasn't my question, but...
Matt.
(gasps)
Uh, I thought you were going to your studio.
Would you believe that the whole world is my studio?
I would not.
Would you believe I lied to you to get out of having dinner with you?
- I would.

'Cause I did the same thing.
(both laugh)
I'm sorry.
Um, Two Christmases:
How to Talk to Your Child about Divorce.

No.

- Ah. (exhales)

Uh, you know what, I was actually looking for the book
- that Colleen and I wrote together,

- but, uh, I can't seem to find it.

I mean, they only had six copies, but, eh...
Is it those six?
Hmm?
"Buy one, get five free"?
That's a little bit of a slap in the face.
Look, I even signed this one at the book reading.
Why would Ollie have returned this?
"Ollie, I've had fun reading this!
I hope you have M.S."
Maybe you should try signing the full name from now on.
Yeah. (sighs)
Well, it's not your fault.

I mean, this is all about marketing.
Like, look at lame Sunshine Funshine over there.
MATT:

I think I know who Teddy's next pick might be.
Can I help you find something?
Can you just read me the list of... every book you have in the store?
It's just I'll know it when I hear it.
SALESMAN:

Oh.

So I just don't want to have to take a boat trip down the...

Don't say that word in here.
Why?

Aardvark's Adventure, uh, by Tina Yothers.
Nope.

- Just rattle 'em off.

Just 'cause it's...

Aardvark's Adventure 2:

Very important book to me and my family.
Aardvark's Adventure 3:
Shakespeare Meets the Bard-vark.
Aardvark's Adventure 4:
Which Bathroom Do I Use?
Aardvark's Adventure 5:

Aardvark's Adventure 6:
Stop Calling Me Anteater.
Aardvark's Adventure 7:
Hanoi, Here We Come by Tina Yothers.
Yep, yep, that's it.
- Awesome.

Wait, I'm just gonna buy it online.
MATT:

(both laugh)
Can you believe a few hours ago we thought it was weird to have dinner together?
I know, we were crazy.
- So crazy.

- Me, too.

- Yeah, come on.

This is our best table.
It's nice and warm over here.
Not that you two need any heat.
- I should really go check on Greg.

_
Let's go in.
No one tailgates at Princesses on Ice.
No, you got to keep eating.
This year, we're not buying one single thing inside that overpriced rip-off of a venue.
Think they can just slap a pink crown on the side of a bucket of popcorn and charge $25?
But I don't want to eat anymore.
This candy's making me jittery.
You got to eat through it.

I thought she only did that when we need a better table at a restaurant.
This is a beverage-smuggling bra.
Helps us beat the system.
We have a problem.
Yeah, we have a problem.

No, look, you can totally see my wine rack.
Well, why didn't you put it on at home so you could tell if your clothes would cover it?
Because, babe, I am not gonna warm up the Chardonnay!
What are we gonna do?

I don't like the way you're looking at me.
(sighs)
- (giggles)

Yeah, be thankful you weren't the one wearing the Donald Duck hat full of salami.
I don't want to sneak wine in for you.
You always tell us to respect the law.
Hey.

There's no law that says a child can't carry it.
- Yes, there is.

I hate this.
I can't go to jail.

Stop freaking out.
I'm glad I didn't know you in high school.
Purse, please.
No, no, no!

(sighs) She couldn't handle the pressure.
That's 'cause you went to the wrong girl.
Strap me in, boss.
Let's ride.
Oh, come on, these are the stories you'll have...
- What do you think?

Oh, that is so disturbing.
Take it off.

(sighs) Fine.
See you girls in high school.
Oh, my God.
Everyone says you know the exact moment when your childhood ends.
How do my boobs look?
And that was it.
If I'd had these puppies in high school,
I would have gotten to second base a lot sooner.
Is it pulling my shirt open in the front?
Yeah.

I'm-I'm gonna drink it down a little bit.
Get that tube out.
Just whip it out there.
- TIM:

(both mumble indistinctly)
Yeah.

- Don't bite it, though.

What?

Hey, buddy.

Purses on the table, ladies.
Would you look at all that alcohol?

This show is for children.
And weird middle-aged men.
Go on in.

Hey, hey, hey.
We did it.
I know.

They look so stupid.
Dad, your boobs are leaking.
- Oh, no.

Oh, you-you didn't close the valve off all the way.
- Oh, no.

- Oh, it's going into my bellybutton.

Drink it, drink it, drink it before it gets
- in my crotch and it's ruined.

Temperature to 70 degrees.
FEMALE VOICE:

Well, at least we got her back to English.
_
There you go, sweetie, play with your toys.
Oh, spider.
Nope.
Ah, got him.
Oh, okay, there it is.
Oh.

Yeah, but we're keeping Lark safe.
- That's what matters.

- Oh, no.

- Lark.

- No, no, no.

Lark.

It's okay, you're not in trouble.
Okay.

Call the fire department.
What's all this?
Oh, I am installing Bluetooth locks on the doors so that we do not get locked out again.
You sure you're gonna have time to do that after you bring your monster to life with lightning?
I told you, all inventors have work aprons.
But you wore that to Starbucks this morning.
Well, yes.

Okay, love you.
Love you.
- Put on my theme song.

♪ Here comes the hot stepper ♪ ♪ Murderer ♪
♪ I'm the lyrical gangster... ♪
(groaning)
Oh, I'm gonna be here a while.
♪ Na, Na-Na-Na-Na, Na-Na-Na-Na... ♪
(Greg groaning)
♪ Na-Na-Na-Na... ♪
O-Oscar!
Oh.

What are you doing?
I-I ain't peeping'.
I was just settin' up your gopher traps.
What?
I was peepin'.
Okay, uh, look.
Uh, will you come in here and help me up?
I pulled my back out.
Just open the door.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, there you go.
That's not safe.
- (groaning):

- Ooh... sorry.

It's okay.

Okay, now I just need those pain pills to kick in.
Hope you don't mind, I took a few for myself.
You know, for-for my nerves and my addiction.
Yeah, sure.

Oh, look at that.

- Yeah.

Watch this.
I just flushed it... you can't see it, but I flushed it.
Take you at your word.
Now I'm putting a fanny washer on.
I hope my mother-in-law ain't on there again.
She got a weak heart.
Wow, Oscar, I'm really seeing a new side of you.
You didn't strike me as the kind of guy
- that's into home automation.

Oh.

Yup, I woke her up.
Oscar?
Oh, my God, have you been living up there?
No.
I was just helping Greg with a little DIY situation.
I know a lot about them, 'cause, uh,
I had three DIYs when I was in high school.
GREG:

You're home.
Yeah.

I thought you said it was just the locks, and also we agreed that Oscar is an outside friend.
Well, yeah, well, we finished that, but then it was so easy to add on.
I mean, now we got music, and security cameras, and thermostats.
I mean, it's gonna be like living in Epcot.
The theme park from 1985?
FEMALE VOICE:

Oh.

Cool.

But, honey, we're so close to living in the future.
But we can't really live in the future.
- GREG:

We was getting deep on that.
I've also gotten pretty deep into some pain pills.
GREG:

Look up and smile to the camera.
(chuckles)
I can see you on my phone right now.
This is so cool.
Oh, you look beautiful in fisheye.
Cool.

Do you think you could just unlock the door, though?
- Yeah.

Let me just...
Oh, man, my phone just died.
Well, you can just use your hands.
Ugh.
- Greg?

Unlock front door.
FEMALE VOICE:

Uh, uh, hold on, one second.

Why is it so hot in here?
Uh, uh, change temperature to 68 degrees.
Thermostat set to 100 degrees.
- GREG:

Lark needs to be changed, and, honestly, if you don't open this door, I might need to be, too.
Yeah, okay, honey.
I'm trying to open the door, okay?

It's just nothing is working.
Yeah.

Playing "Greg's Theme."
- Wh... no, no.

- ♪ Here comes the hot stepper ♪

- ♪ Murderer... ♪

Let-let me just work it out, okay?
Playing "Greg's Workout Mix."
No, no, no, no, no.
GREG'S VOICE:

You can do it.

- Pump it.

- GREG'S VOICE:

- Just open the door.

- I promise you're not in trouble, okay?

Okay, okay.

- I mean...

(groans) You can do anything
- you put your mind to.

You're huge.

Oh, that can't be good.
Honey, I need you to call the fire department.
FEMALE VOICE:

GREG:

GREG'S VOICE:

Now get even more jacked.
I want you to stand by me
- during the ceremony.

And hold Tank... she's my best man.
_
COLLEEN:

And I was just trying to hold it together because I was officiating the wedding.
And also I am a really ugly crier.
- Right, Matt?

You're so beautiful all the time.
Hey, what happened to your engagement?
MATT:

She was crying.

Well, we-we did get our marriage license, and, uh, and I got a bow tie that is sexy as fudge, but we s... just haven't figured out when to do it.
It's just hard to find a time when we can get everybody together.
Right.

So, are you really an ordained Mexican?
- Minister.

(chuckles) Okay.
Interesting.
(whispering):

- No, do you?

Joanie.
Joanie, let's get married.
Now?
Why not?

Uh, I think Matt left.
Whatever, we can do it without him.
I'm sitting right here.
Oh, hey, Matt.

We can't do this without you, bud.
JOAN:

We don't even have any doves.
Except the dead ones in the chimney.
Mom, we don't need doves.
Listen, we can do other things.
Sam can take care of the decorations.
Clem and Tyler, you guys should be in charge of the cake.
Shouldn't we be doing music?
Yeah, if you give us a few minutes,
I think we're gonna play really good.
HEATHER:

Matt, you should move all of the furniture.
- Alone?

Probably want to run home and change.
Oh, yeah, that's a good call.
I'm gonna do that and I'm definitely gonna come back.
Yay, another wedding.

Excuse me, I have to change.

So, John, what are you thinking... traditional vows, you want to write your own?
You know, anything past "I do"
seems a little desperate.
Oh, no, Dad, you, you really got to write your own vows.
I mean, you know how much Mom cares about gestures like that.
It's why I always write her one of my Gregmark cards.
Isn't there a song that goes along with that card?
Yeah, it goes... (sings a tune)
It's not that good,
- but it's the thought that counts.

- (phone rings)

It's my friends Hank and Poppy, that I married.
Mm.

- Hello.

Yeah?
Help me with the vows.
I got nothing.
Just speak from your heart.
Well, I got the closer.

with "ride her like a pony."
But, uh, how do I make it more... romantic?
Maybe just keep thinking.
Ah.
I really don't see how looking at my vows is gonna help you.
They are extremely personal.
- I just want to study the structure.

Wow, this is steamy.

I'd be reading these things to her in private.
More like into her privates.
We're done here.
COLLEEN:

Hello?

Oh...
What's wrong?
I can't marry your parents because I couldn't even marry my friends.
- Hmm?

I got on that Russian Web site... it wasn't valid.
Wait, weren't they saving themselves for marriage?
Yes.
I'm gonna feel so bad if they go to hell.
- Oh...

- We're gonna do the right thing.

We are gonna let my parents' marriage be a lie, and we are gonna take this secret with us to our graves.
I have never felt closer to you.
I love you so much.
Mom-Mom?
Why are you eating my secret candy?
Because I couldn't find my secret cigarettes.
I don't know what's going on with you, but you can't just sit here and eat candy.
You're right.
Because I should communicate my feelings openly.
No, because that's my candy.
(quietly):

(loud, off-key melody)
(saxophone screeches)
Hey, your mom looks kind of tense.
Oh, no, that's just the face she makes when Heather plays saxophone.
(saxophone screeches)
And even though I'm the one marrying you, the real marriage is in your hearts.
Just remember that if anything, you know, comes up in the future or anything.
And now the vows.

- I'm up first?

I'm kind of used to being the topper, but okay.
Joanie, I don't have the words to describe your beauty, or the way my heart does a little jump every time you walk into the room.
Even if I did, it wouldn't do justice
- to the love between us.

Yeah, Dad, let me just talk to you
- in private real quick.

They're getting married, Matthew.
Does everything have to be about you?
Well, when he's using my vows, yeah, Greg.
What?
Those are your vows?
Oh, my gosh, those are for me?
I-I'm sorry, Joanie.

"Joanie, Joanie, ride her like a pony"?
Stop!
Look what you did, Matt.

Oh, no, no, no, no, Mom, really, it's okay.
Dad can use my vows.
Honey, no, no, no, no, no.
John, I love you so much, but I'm not able to marry you.
Thank God I'm not the only one.
What's his name, Joanie?
It's John.
Somehow that makes it worse.
- No, it's you.

You know, I've had a lot of patients that stay together just because they're married.
But every day we make a decision to be together.
That means so much to me.
Why do we want to mess with that?
Well, works for me.
Wedding's canceled, huh?
(laughter)
Congratulations, you're still not married.
- JOAN:

Ooh, best man peed on the rug.
(playing Mendelssohn's "Wedding March")
(applause)
Do you feel anything yet?
- Nope, I think we got ripped off.

Worst wedding ever.
