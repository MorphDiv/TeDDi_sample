When I was a child, my planet Krypton was dying.
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.
But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become "Superman".
I hid who I really was until one day when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.
To most people, I'm a reporter at CatCo Worldwide Media.
But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.
I am Supergirl.
KARA:

Mother?

We finally found you.
Return with us to Daxam.
That Kryptonian girl has poisoned you.
No, I'm done being your prince.
You should leave this planet and never return.
I deserve better than being lied to.
You do.
You're right, okay?

I can't do this.

Stay with me.

I'm so sorry I lied to you.
I forgive you.
What smells so...

No, no, no, no!
I'm trying to make you breakfast in bed.
I'm going for full romance, here.

Okay, that's very sweet.
But there is no way you're getting in the way of me and bacon!
And biscuits!
And, oh, is that a poached egg?
- Yeah.

Oh, I found the instructions.
Turns out books have a lot more useful information than YouTube.
- Hey!

You have changed.
- Oh yeah?

Well, I figured since you were good enough to take me back, that I should be good enough to fill every moment of your life with joy.
And...

Well, there's one good thing about not having to work at CatCo.
- What's that?

(KARA CHUCKLES)
Any word from your parents?
No.

Is that what they mean by helicopter parenting?
NEWSCASTER:

Oh, crap.
as a violent alien wages an all-out attack against innocent civilians.
Laser eye patch.

Well, duty calls...
Do you want me to come with you?

- Sure.

I'll just get changed...

- You are so fast.

(SUPERGIRL TAKES OFF)
I'll get a jump start on that laundry!
(SCREAMING)
(ROARS)
(GROANS)
(GRUNTS)
J'onn?

*SUPER GIRL* Season 02 Episode 17 "Distant Sun"
Madam President.
I saw Supergirl had a hostile alien to deal with this morning.
Yes.

It's under control.
- Is that why you called?

I called to get an update on the Daxamite ship.
At the moment it seems to be in low orbit.
No communication or signs of activity for days.
But according to Mon-El, the Daxamite we've been working with, they could be dangerous.
I was afraid of that.
How would you like to proceed?
I'm concerned that if we make any moves, we could end up in a major intergalactic conflict.
I don't disagree.
Director, I know Supergirl was involved in brief combat with the ship.
I have to ask you to refrain from engaging again.
With all due respect, Madam President, if they present a threat, we must...
We must be smart about it.
And my office will gather more intel.
Until then, err on the side of caution.
I understand.
I'll be in touch.
So was yoga as awful as you thought it would be?
- Yes.

You're in a league of your own, Danvers.
Ugh...

We're that couple.

I know.

- Maggie.

How are...

Yeah. (STAMMERS) Just for the week.

Oh.

Hi.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm Emily.

- We used to date.

- It's been...

We should catch up sometime.
Sure.

Sometime.
EMILY:

And let you guys get up to whatever you've got going on.
But it was really good to see you.
You too.
- Nice to meet you.

What about tonight?
What?
Well, she wants to catch up.

No.

Do you see how cool I'm being about this?
I mean, come on.
Emily?
Do you want to have dinner with us tonight?
Uh, yeah.

I have the same e-mail, just let me know where.
- We will.

See, that wasn't so bad.
Remember that alien you fought this morning?
The one with the laser-shooting eye patch?

WINN:

J'ONN J'ONZZ:

I'm sorry.

Yep.

Hey, that's me.
What is it?
It's an interplanetary messaging device.
It accesses some kind of alien darknet for all your shady space needs.
Is there a message?
RECORDED VOICE:

The last daughter of Krypton.

Three hundred quartz crowns upon proof of death.
Someone put a bounty on your head.
How much is three hundred quartz crowns?
A lot.

Oh.

Or like, a hipster, up-and-coming kind of vibe?
Exactly.
For that kind of bounty, every low-life killer in the universe will be headed this way to take their shot.
Oh, that's fine.

Hey, hey.

Not that I doubt you, okay?
But a series of battles with interstellar bounty hunters doesn't seem like a good way to ensure public safety.
Alex is right.
I want you staying out of sight until we can figure out who is behind this.
Wait a second.

Sometimes hiding is a strategic necessity.
And since you asked,
I-I too think that you should hide.
'Cause I just lost you.

'Cause that would not be...

Hey, that's a very culinary way to put it.
- I cook now.

I'm the Girl of Steel.
I don't bend.

I know none of us can stop you if you choose to go out there, but please, as the people who care about you, give us a day to try and get ahead of this thing.
(SIGHS)
Fine.
Okay.

J'ONN J'ONZZ:

Maybe we can stop those bounty hunters before they strike.
Agent Danvers, run a database search for other species who might be using this network.
Absolutely.

No.

That's ridiculous.
Uh, these databases won't search themselves.
Actually they will, I just got to write a program for it.
And I just signed up for more work, didn't I?

Let's get out of here.
- Mon-El?

Keep an eye on her.
I will.
There's just something I have to do first.
So this is how they entertain royalty on this planet.
Mother, Father.
We were glad when we received your message.
Hey, Mon-El, can I grab a pint?
I'm not working.

You work here?

I'm a mixologist.
It is an artistic profession in the medium of preparing alcoholic beverages.
And it is very honorable.
I don't believe anyone in this hovel does anything important.
(UNDER HIS BREATH) That's lovely.
Look, so, I don't wanna believe it, but I know it was you.
You know what was us?
You placed the bounty on Kara's life.
Did you really think that if you had her killed that I was just going to change my mind and come back with you?
(CHUCKLES) You've become quite imaginative in your time here.
Is that so?

Does she seem like a person who has any shortage of enemies?
I can assure you we have nothing to do with this.
Okay, so, if it's not you, why are you still on Earth?
Because we're hoping you'll come to your senses.
Do you know how long we've been searching for you?
Years.

We thought we were lost.

But for your mother's strength, despair would have overwhelmed us.
When you were a child, you used to grab my leg with both arms every time I tried to leave the room.
I would have to peel you off of me like some gangly little magnet.
And it broke my heart.
Until we heard your beacon,
I thought we'd lost you forever.
And now...
I would rather die than leave Earth without you.
You have to trust that all we want is for you to come home.
We wish no harm on your friend.
Remember, we're your parents.
When you call, we come.
Even to places that disagree with us.
Maybe she's having trouble parking.
She hates parking, she always valets.
Do you want to try texting her?
It's been 45 minutes.
I'm sure there's a good reason she's not here.
It's okay, Alex.
No, it's...
Look, I feel bad.
I can see it was an awkward thing that I pushed you into and now...
No.

Emily's just...
What?
Well, when we broke up, she said some things that cut me pretty deep.
And we were together for five years, it was the longest relationship I've ever had.
So, when she said that I didn't deserve to be happy,
I figured she really knew me.

No, it wasn't, and that was a terrible thing to say.
It doesn't matter anymore, it was a long time ago.
It does matter.
Can we just get out of here?
Of course.
Check, please.
I hate this.
What, the game?
No!

I hate being stuck inside.
Look, look.

No, no!
J'onn said you can't go anywhere as Supergirl.
Should have never let you watch the news.
I will be back before I miss my turn.
- No.

Mon-El, I'm very happy you're here.
And not just because you have super strength.
Now maybe you can stand in the way of her and her super suit.
- Yeah.

I was just questioning some suspects.
Who?
My parents.
So you think your parents ordered the bounty on me?
Well, they say they didn't, but I'm not so sure.
They should meet my dad.

Yeah, from what you've said about it, I'm sure that's true.
(RINGING)
(RINGING)
- Oh, shoot.

Ah... (CHUCKLING)
KARA:

(RINGING CONTINUES)
I can't move.
MON-EL:

I...
Um...
Whoa!

♪♪
What are you doing?
I don't know, it's not me!
(GRUNTS)
I'm sorry.
I'm not in control of my body.
- (GRUNTS)

(GROANS)
I'm sorry!

I had that coming.
Looks like someone's controlling him.
- (BEEPING)

- What's working?

Which means there is a bounty hunter and he is close.
(GRUNTS)
Can you control it?
No!
I just feel pins and needles all over.
- Okay...

(GRUNTS) You have to run.
I'm much too dangerous.
Just focus and try to fight it.
I can't!
Oh, no.

Me too.
(GROANING)
I don't think I can fight it.
Wait... (SOBS)
Let him go.
Or the sidewalk gets a new paint job.
(RINGING STOPS)
- (GRUNTS) - (GROANS)
Ow.

Oh, oh!

So, Creepy McGee here got inside Mon-El's brain and thought he could use him to kill Supergirl.
Rude.
Who put the bounty out on me?
He knows.

I'm the most powerful telepath in the Alcorian system.
I know more than you can imagine.
Oh, yeah, except for the difference between a gun and a stapler.
BOUNTY HUNTER:

You humans are too moral to do what's necessary to penetrate my mind.
Winn, get me a wrench.
J'ONN J'ONZZ:

Stand down.
Come at me, bro.
(RINGING)
(YELLS)
It was the Daxamites!
Queen Rhea placed the bounty...
MON-EL:

I mean, you're not safe.
We'll figure this out.
I mean, how?

In their minds, they honestly believe that if they get rid of you, then I'm just going to go back home.
We need to retaliate.
I mean, if we strike back, we could force them to pull the bounty and leave Earth.
Uh, listen, I like revenge just as much as the next geek but need I remind you that they have an impenetrable warship?
Well, Winn, you can find a way in.
No, he can't.
I mean, I might be able to.
We can't take any action against the Daxamite ship whatsoever.
- I have orders from President Marsdin.

Attacking them could spark an intergalactic war.
They attacked us.
I'll brief the President and wait for her instructions.
Until then, our only mission is to keep Supergirl safe.
Emily.
Alex, right?
Yeah.
I wanted to come see you.
I wanted to talk to you.

Look, if this is about dinner...
Why didn't you show up?
I should have, but...
The whole situation, it just brought up too many painful memories.
What about Maggie?
And all the things you said to her back then...

Anything I said to her, she had coming.
She dedicated five years of her life to you and you bailed on her.
I bailed on her?
(SCOFFS)
Seriously?

I'm sorry, I...

I shouldn't have said anything.
But the truth is I just...
Really want to forget about it.
Sorry, I'm...
I'm going to go.
Hey, so I've been thinking about a solution to our problem.
- Yeah.

There's only one thing we can do.
- Talk to your mother.

- Wait, what?

(STAMMERING) So there's this planet that a Durlan emissary told me about when I was a kid.
It's got water, and a yellow sun, it's got everything we need to survive.
My parents wouldn't find us there.
We'd be together, we'd be safe.
I think of this because I'm reading this play right now, Romeo and Juliet?
Yeah, I've heard of it.
Right and there's this moment at the end where I am right now, where they're about to run away together and to live happily ever after.
And I can't help but think that that could be us.

Yeah, but Juliet and Romeo both die at the end.
I did not see that coming.
And no.
We're not going to your secret planet.
I'm Supergirl, I don't run from anything.
Yeah, I know.
It's one of the more annoying things about you.
- Thank you.

(SIGHS) I mean, you...

They want you dead and they want me to come home.
And they're...
They get what they want.
That's why we have to talk to your mother.
But J'onn just said we can't engage with them.
No.

We can still talk to her.
Then you can get her to realize all she really wants is for you to be happy.
And then she'll realize that Earth is the best place for you.
Your mother can change.
You just have to talk to her.
People don't really change.
Sure they do.
You did.
You've become someone incredible and unselfish.
Just give her a chance.
You really think I'm incredible?
No.

(CHUCKLES)
Yeah.
Okay, well, I'll contact the ship.
It's worth a shot.
RHEA:

And I thought the location of our last meeting was vile.
Uh, this place is sacred to me and my cousin.
I thought it was the only place on Earth worthy enough to entertain you, Your Majesty.
The Kryptonians were never very good at entertaining.
Look.

MON-EL:

Look, Mother, I know that you love me, okay?
And I know that you think you want what's best for me.
But can't you see that being here on Earth with Kara makes me happy?
Call off your bounty.
And maybe you and I can still have a relationship.
I am your mother.
You do not dictate the terms of our relationship.
Your son has found a home here.
Friends, a life...

Don't take that away from him.
I know our worlds have had their differences.
Which is all the more reason that we need to fight to make peace.
When Mon-El first landed here, we didn't understand each other.
But we found a connection.
Through the kindness in our hearts.
And that comes from somewhere.
You have kindness in your heart.
Please just try to understand that letting him stay here is the right thing to do.
Whatever connection you think you've found with my son during this tryst is a lie.
- Hey, are you all right?

I don't feel so... (GRUNTS)
I should have handled this myself from the beginning.
Where did you get Kryptonite?
Our planet is littered with the corpse of yours.
- No, don't!

(SCREAMS)
I crossed an ocean of stars looking for my son.
I'm not going to let you get in my way now.
Your family awaits you.
No!
Wait!

SUPERGIRL:

No, you can't.
Whatever you want.

All of it.

I have your word?
No tricks?
No resistance?
You have my word.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I'm sorry, Kara.

So long as you're safe.
(WHISPERS) Don't go.
- Mon-El.

It's okay.
Son.

Mon-El, why don't you go clean up while we prepare for departure.
Call off the bounty on Kara.

It's done.
It was you?
You issued the bounty?
I did what I had to do to get back my son.
(DOOR OPENS)
Hey.
What's so urgent?
I went to see Emily.
What...

Well, I wanted to go talk to her after seeing how upset you were at the restaurant.
I went to stick up for you.
Alex...
It's not your problem to fix.
You were never gonna really tell me that you cheated on her, were you?
(SCOFFS)
That was a long time ago.

And I already feel bad about it.
You want to bring it up, so I can feel worse?
No, no.

Look.

Okay?

This is about the fact that you don't trust me enough to tell me the truth.
I wanted to.
Listen.
I've thought a lot about this.
You have a pattern of keeping things to yourself.
You hid the truth about Emily, you made her seem like the bad guy.
And then before that, you didn't tell me what really happened when you came out to your parents.
And how badly they reacted.
- You don't like to talk about you.

So, I think that when your parents didn't accept you,
you stopped trusting people that are closest to you.
And I totally get that.
But, Maggie...
You don't have to be guarded with me.
Okay?

I'm here to help you heal.
You don't think I'm a bad person?
No.

But it's really nice to see that you have problems, too.
Thank you.
Yeah.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Sorry.
It's Kara.

Hey.

What happened?
Whoa, slow down, slow down.

Okay.

Kara's hurt.

I have to get to the DEO.
I'm...

MAGGIE:

ALEX:

What did she do to you?
She had Kryptonite.
We need to get you under a yellow sun lamp.
No.

Now we have to save his.
I can't let you do that.
No, I'm okay.
It's not that.
We're under strict orders not to engage.

This is Mon-El's life.

I cannot disobey the President of the United States.
I know it's easy to let emotions get involved, but there's a protocol.
I'm not the one calling the shots right now.
I know how much you care for Mon-El.
But this is too dangerous.
I have to save him.

Once that ship leaves he's gone forever.
He's made his choice.
He's with his people, Kara.
Mon-El did not choose this.

And if we wait for President's orders,
Mon-El and his parents could be light-years away.
We need to go now.
I'm the one that convinced him to do this.
To try to reason with his mother.
He's up there because of me.
Please.

I want you to know that Kara Zor-El will be safe.
And in time, you will see that coming home was the right thing to do.
I already know it was right.
If I didn't come back, Mother would have killed the woman I love.
(SIGHS) Your life will always be Rhea's responsibility.
But son, you belong with your people.
It means so much to them to have you back.
If this is about the people, then some things have to change.
One day I will become king.
And I want to be a different kind of king.
And why not start now?
Why not rebuild our kingdom better than it was.
And make justice available for everyone.
And get rid of rank and make it so that everyone's voice is heard equally.
- This is absurd.

Why is that so absurd?

So why should we go and just recreate the same broken system as before?
Because it's what the people need.
Do you think we survived the destruction of our world by giving everyone a say?
Our royal house stood for a thousand years because the people need our order.
And our leadership.
Our house would have fallen.
So rebuild with me, Father.

RHEA:

It will take us four years to reach Daxam.
Maybe if you spend that time in a cell you'll be cured of these misconceptions.
Father, help...
The engines will be ready for departure in five minutes, Your Majesties.
Thank you.
We can finally get away from the poison of planet Earth.
So, you may remember heat-visioning the bonkers out of this bad boy back on the rescue mission to Slaver's Moon.
But with a little TLC, little elbow grease, we've got it fully operational again.
This is just one portal.

No, apparently, the other portal acts as more of a beacon.
So, as long as you have the exact coordinates of where you want to transmat, you only need one gate?
Mmm-hmm.

One gate and one, you know, flawless calculation of the ship's location as it hurtles through space relative to us as we spin on the Earth's axis at about 1,000 miles per hour.
And if the calculation's wrong?
You'll transmat directly into the cold vacuum of space.
Let's hope it's not wrong.
So, in order to get to Mon-El, we have to distract the queen.
Whoa, okay.

Looks like the Daxamites are about to leave.
We have to go now.
But what about the Kryptonite?
I have an idea.
Ion thrusters are ready and the navigation system is set for Daxam.
Take us out.
You just don't know when to let go, do you?
I was gonna say the same thing about you.
(GRUNTS)
(SUPERGIRL GRUNTS)
(STRAINING)
Round two.
- (ENERGY WHIRRING) - (YELPS)
- Winn?

Oh, thank God I am not in space.
You are in space.
Oh, yeah.

Uh, I'm here to rescue you.

Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
You finally saw Star Wars.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
(GROANS)
The Kryptonite...
Doesn't have much effect on me.
Open sesame.
Fantastic.

Oh, I'm already one step ahead of you.

Hey, hey.

Crystal clear.
Winn, can you bring up the Throne Room?
You got it.
Is the portal programmed to the ship's location?
Yeah, but...

Finish him.
Is it really you this time?
Does that answer your question?
(GRUNTS)
Rhea!
(GROANS)
My mother will kill her.
We've got to help.

All we want is for our family to be together.
That's what we want too.
(BOTH STRAINING)
RHEA:

Kryptonian, but you never change.
You take what you want, without a care for our world.
Kara.
(BOTH STRAINING)
(YELLING)
(SCREAMING)
Whoa!
- Enough.

He has made his decision.
I can see now that this is your family.
You came after me.
Every time.
Krypton has taken everything from me.
And now you take my son.
I'm glad you're both alive.
But this is the last time we'll ever see each other.
I hope one day you'll understand.
Alex, we're ready now.
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
ALEX:

Good.
Thank you for making me do that.
You guys talking about me at the end there?
Yeah.

She's right.
(GIGGLING)
Let's go.
Director, did you engage the Daxamite ship?
Yes.

I have my sources.
And you had your orders.
I'm disappointed.
I understand.
But an alien who was under our protection, who had been given amnesty, was taken against his will and we were his only hope.
And what if things hadn't turned out your way?
It's my job to ensure that they do.
I made a decision and I accept the consequences.
Director J'onzz, I will let you know when I decide what those consequences will be.
The ship has left Earth's orbit?
Yes, ma'am.
That will be all for now.
(GIGGLES)
I just want all of these sugary...

Nothing.

I just really didn't think I was going to see you again.

Yeah, me either.
But not for long.

I knew I couldn't let that happen.
Well, yeah.
And I'm sorry I forced you to talk to your mom.
I should have listened to you.
- I was wrong.

You believe that people can change and you gave them a chance to do it.
Like my father.

He understood that I was happy here on Earth.
He saw what I wanted and he found the goodness in his heart to let me stay.
So, you were right to be hopeful.
I think we could all stand to be a little more like you.
More optimistic and brave...
I think you were pretty brave.
No, I just did what I knew you would have done.
And it was terrifying.
(LAUGHS)
But you, I mean, you do that every day.
I don't even understand it.
Mmm...
You make it look so easy, to do the right thing that you wouldn't even guess that it's that hard.
But it's hard.
You sacrifice a lot for everyone else and...
I know I'm beginning to sound like a broken record here but I admire you.
Well, I'm not going to forget the way you sacrificed yourself for me.

So we saved each other today.
Yeah.
Just like Romeo and Juliet.
You really need to finish it.
Can you finish reading that, please?
- Yeah, how does it end?

- Come here.

He's really gone, isn't he?
He made his decision, Rhea.
On Daxam, we value happiness.
He never would have been happy with us.
We used to be so in sync, you and I.
The day we took our vows, we promised to stand by each other's side.
We looked out on those that we loved most and we made a commitment.
To our marriage but, more importantly,
our family.
You ruined that today.
I am still by your side.
We will move on.
No.
We won't.
(GRUNTS)
You betrayed me, my love.
I'm not done with this world.
