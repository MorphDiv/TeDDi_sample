- And don't you never come back.

HOUGHTON:

I promise you, she's gonna look after you, okay?
(panting, groaning) Goddamn.
- I'm pregnant.

HASIL:

- born half a Farrell.

BUTCH:

Easy money.

(crowd clamoring)
- Times are tough.

Next time, chain 'em up.
While you're here, I'm gonna give you basic survival advice.
Keep your head down.

Got something for you.

From the brotherhood.
Smash his skull like a watermelon.
(metal clatters on floor)
You don't fool me, Farrell.
There's a bloodthirsty lion in you.
(man screaming)
The fire was by Kinnah hand.
G'WIN:

- She's up to something.

- Will you help me?

Thou art not our Bren'in, for we are not Farrell.

Foster, we'll get all the knives, all the arrows, hatchets, everything.
You just give us the word, we'll take them witches out.
Well, you could do that.
But you'd probably die trying.
And you would do it anyway, I know.
But right now, the Bren'in, she's got a gun to her head.
So nobody tries nothing.
What do they want with her, anyways?
You stay here.

They killed Hezzy, too.
- Burnt him alive.

Never in our history has the Bren'in been held prisoner by our own clan.
They ain't our clan.
So what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Yet.

Actions speak louder.
I agree with you, Mr. Farrell.
But the stench of them.
I mean... (coughs):

Can't you smell it?

You know, I got a pretty good sense of smell, and I don't think it was them.
Maybe it's your upper lip?
(laughs)
You, you, my friend, you're as pure as the driven snow.
I love that phrase.
Etymology:

Snow so white and pure, it's yet to be poisoned by this wicked world.
Just like you.
I'm proud to have a pure being such as yourself among us, sir.
I've chosen you, and you will join me.
One, because in hell, you don't have a choice.
Two, because you're the whitest man to shit inside these walls since I walked in here 18 years ago.
We're pure, we're clean.
We share the same heart.
Understand?
♪ ♪
(door opens, closes)
What do you want?
I have offered you everything we have.
MOREGON:

I commend you for holding fast to so many of your generous ways.
And for understanding that the modern world has poisoned us all.
We agree on that.
So pardon me for my confusion.
- About?

- It is.

Seems you're a bit dependent on them right now.
Leadership is not easy.
Remaining true to what we believe, to this mountain, this talamh, means that difficult choices must be made.
Especially when there are those who refuse to understand.
G'WIN:

I refuse to understand that someone has to die
- so that you can prove to...

You ran straightaway to a drunken man for help.
Which confirmed what I wish were not true:
you're weak.
And that we had no choice but to steal your own fire to convince you to let us do what we came here to do.
Which is what?
Cosain full ond full.
"Only blood can save blood"?
When our people came to this continent, we brought with us all the ancient rites, the ones the Christians tried to kill.
We held fast to them.
And when we settled up here, safe from the so-called Americans, we began to lose hold of them.
That is why the Kinnah left.
Only blood can save blood, so the strongest of you must die.
- What are you talking about?

To rid us of all the ills you brought up onto this sacred hill.
- A sacrifice.

- At the full moon.

MOREGON:

For you to join me, for us to save this clan together.
You're gonna kill a man for his blood.
Not me.
You.
Moregon, I let you live among us.
I agreed we needed to change.
I sought your counsel, but th... this is madness.
No!

We are not murderers.
We are a family.
And your beloved husband...

And you?

- You failed, but still.

- I see.

MOREGON:

He is just one of your family.
And every hour, one will die... until you agree.
So go on, tell this boy that you're too weak to do your duty and purify this mountain as the Bren'in must.
No.
- (gunshot)

- They shot the Bren'in!

Foster, no!
You want to shoot?

(gasping)
(crying)
(whispers):

A man who is willing to die for someone he loves.
He is the strongest.
(G'Win continues crying)
Take him away.
- Why?

Dollars?
- For rent.

Which is...?
Are you kidding me?
- No.

Okay.

Well, it just seems like an odd notion to me, but go on.
And I... we can't stay here anymore.
Babies and bongs don't really go together.
My brother is crazy, and "crazy" is not even the word
I'd begin to use to describe your family.
We need a place of our own.
- Agreed?

Yeah.

What's that?
That's $200, for food, furnishings, like a bed, a table, microwave.
And the rest of this stuff is basics.
Just dish soap, toilet paper.
Stop.
I know you know what toilet paper is.
- All right.

- Which are what?

What do you mean, water?

We pay for water, babe.

You got to pay for water?

Well, what about air?

How much, how much the air cost down here?
- I'm being serious.

And we haven't even gotten to the biggest one.
- What's that?

I told you, the free clinic is closed.
We're gonna have to pay for everything out of pocket.
Do you understand what I'm telling you?
- Yeah.

And I don't have a job.
And, baby, neither do you.
You know what?

I-I don't even know what it is that I'm trying to do here.
- Wait, wait.

- Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey.

- It's too hard for me to...

Stop.
It's gonna be all right.
Me and Butch, we're working on something.
I'm gonna get us money.

You and Butch are gonna get money together?
Selling drugs?
That's gonna be fine?
- I already told you, I'm not bringing a baby...

- ...to come visit you in jail.

It ain't moonshine.

What, then?
I just need you to trust me.
- Okay?

Hey, Sam.

- Okay.

Um, can I sit down?
(sighs)
Hey, um, Sam, I found your house.
It was right by the bear.
Just like you said.
I found your folks.
Do you know what happened to them, Sam?
Can I ask you about it?
Anything you saw that you want to tell me about, you can tell me about it.
You don't have to be scared.
This is a great place and you're real safe here.
- He told me not to look.

- The big man.

Was he a friend of your parents?

- He was a stranger?

What'd he look like, Sam?
He was big, long hair, and, um...
- What do you mean, Sam?

Sam, uh...
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna show you a photograph, okay?
It's not scary.

Is that him?
More old with long white hair.
He's a big guy?
Older guy?

- Did he tell you his name?

LEDDA:

(crowd murmurs)
I think that we need some new ideas.
I see a lot of new faces here today, which is great.
Anybody?
Well, won't we have a booth set up near the parade?
LEDDA:

- that we can do better than that, don't you?

You mean you want to do an action there?
- Yes I do.

- That's what we're here to sort out.

Coal Days is something everybody in this town loves.

I mean, my kids look forward to that parade for months.
- I know and so do mine.

Not the most popular thing I've ever been involved with.
And now you want to go really pissing everybody in town off by ruining their summer fun?
That's not gonna get us any likes.
Pardon me, but, uh... it's not about the likes.
- Hi, everybody.

My name is Gordon.
I'm not from here, but I heard about you guys from all the way across the country.
You guys are amazing, just amazing.
Well, thank you.
When I saw that video, and your courage and your passion... you're my hero.
Seriously.
So, look, I'm just here to help, if you need me.
I've worked on a lot of campaigns:
fracking in Pennsylvania, tar sands pipeline, deforestation.
And if you don't mind me saying, an action at the Coal Days Festival, a real action,
Ledda here is 100% right.
Now is not the time to back off.
Now is the time to show people how strong we really are.
(crowd murmuring)
(security alarm blaring)
GUARD:

Get him off.
(handcuffs click)
A real man fights his own battles.
BIG FOSTER:

How do you think we thrived up on this rock for all these years?
Do you think that coal company is the first threat we've seen?
There were winters so harsh the trees were frozen dead and cracked apart in the breeze.
There were infestations, famines.
What you face now, it's a child's game.
You've forgotten the cyfraiths, the creideamhs, the old laws.
You Farrells, you're the Losties, not them below.
I never believed her.
- My mother.

- She was a woman.

- MOREGON:

Prophecy of a demon among us.
I'm looking at her right now.
And all she wants is power.
No.

Tomorrow, when all this is done, and the goodness of the mountain has been restored, we Kinnah will be gone.
And your people, truly, know this, Foster:
they will thank you for what you've done.
Because in dying, you'll finally become the man you've always wanted to be.
G'Winveer,
- she will never do it.

She poisoned you.
Just like your mother did.
No.
She's one of us now, a believer.
She just needed a bit of persuading.
I don't believe it.
She will perform her part in the rite because she loves her people.
And also because, in her heart, she wants to see you dead.
- So you drove from Oregon?

One shot, didn't even stop to eat.
(chuckles) As you can no doubt tell.
(laughs) Not a lot of
- vegan options on the interstate, I'm guessing.

So thank you very much for feeding me.
You know, people around here seem really generous.
- So you were born in Blackburg you said?

How lucky of you.
You're not serious.
Look, I've lived in a lot of places in my life, and this really is...
I was gonna say God's country, but I'm not really religious.
You okay with that?
Yeah.

- We crazy Christians.

Although, I'm not really sure about that label, you know?
I'm a spiritual guy.
I don't know, maybe I'm just...

- You know what I mean?

So, how'd you get into all this, anyway?
Well, I was gonna be a tech whiz, startup billionaire, you know.
I went to Stanford when I was 16, then straight to Google.
Then one day, I read about how they were gonna destroy
Creek River in Oregon to put up a dam.
- Mm-hmm.

I went up there for a protest and... never came back.
So I quit my job, bought the camper, and now I drive around the country milching food off people I barely even met.
Have at it.
My girls don't like raw vegetables, anyway.
- Few sane people do.

So what about you?

You know, I never really had anything against coal mining, 'cause those are the only jobs.
But then when they said they were gonna blow up Shay Mountain,
I just couldn't watch that happen.
I mean, this mountain is a part of me.
I've seen it every day of my life.
Like, literally, I mean that.
So folks around here are pro-coal because they need jobs.
- They do, but...

Yes.
You know, where I'm from, everybody thinks I'm a hero.
But you,
I mean, you're the really brave one here.
I mean, you're really a hero.
I mean that.
You know, the thing is, when I was a little girl,
I was taught to be seen and not heard.
You got to go along to get along, my mom used to say.
So when I started this thing, it felt... wrong.
Really wrong.
And then I realized that I liked feeling wrong.
Like, it felt right to be wrong.
Do you know what I mean?
Can I ask you a serious question?
Sure.
Do I smell?
(both laughing)
Are you actually asking me?
- Because...

I mean, my camper's got a solar bag,
- but that thing's been empty for a long time. - (laughs)
Uh, there's a shower upstairs if that's what you're getting at.
Well, I think Mother Earth will thank you personally.
- Let me get you a towel.

Oh.

Do you want to join me?
Or would that be wrong?
DR. MEHTA:

Hmm.

But it gave the shorter ones an easier target.
You have to find a way to keep them away.
The guards saw them attack you.
That's the only reason you're not in Ad Seg.
But you should be, and I can recommend it, say that you're a danger to the other inmates.
No.

It's the only place we can guarantee your safety.
You know, if I only know one thing, Doc, it's that you got to be real careful about what you give away just to feel safe.
I spent every day of my life with the sun on my face, but when I was down there, I couldn't even see the sky.
I ain't going back there.
I need to see daylight.
DR. MEHTA:

No.

My home is too beautiful to put down on paper.
- (chuckles):

- India.

Oh, they wanted a better life.
They find it?
Where I come from, they put you in a cage to help you think about what it is you did that might have hurt somebody.
This place...

Hmm.
Oh.
Thank you.

He says he don't much like freakazoids.

I'll be lining up the bets.

'Cause it's gonna be big.
Most def.
Don't you be telling me that I got to lose this one, too.
There's more money to be made winning, Butch.

Ain't happening, bro.
Look, we're in this together.

Should you choose to do it,

I'm gonna win this.

Afraid of what you really are.
You don't know nothing about me.

'Cause that's what it's gonna be.
You need to quit that group of yours.
Yeah.

That is never gonna happen, okay?
Well, then I'm gonna take your girls away from you
- before one of them can get hurt.

You think I'm not being serious?

I'm not right in the head?

You know what?

And then you can have my girls for good, how's that?

So I guess we still got to find the guy now.
Wonder how we're gonna do that.
Hey, come on in, Sheriff.
I want you out of my station house right now.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

- You can pack up all your stuff right now.

- Yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo.

I found a gun out at the site of that triple homicide out on Chimney Road.
Ballistics match the gun that killed Breece Dobbs.
Fingerprints came back, Foster Farrell's not a match.
I want you to clear all your stuff.
Get out of here.

And then I'm gonna get a lawyer to get him out of there.
Wait, wait, wait.

You know who I was just on the phone with?
Marsil.
Foster Farrell killed an inmate.
Broke his neck.
What?
No.

Why not?
Is it because you had a hunch that he was a good man?
Well, guess what.

Not at all.
Nice police work, though.

I'm sorry for what I said before.
I didn't mean it.
Okay.
You know, uh...
Uh, you say, you know, you say everything happened for a reason.
Yeah.
I think ev-everything happened for a reason.
Um, wh-what are you talking about?
It's not your fault; it's mine.
I don't understand.

All this.

All of this is my fault.
I didn't do something when I should have.
Now, I-I know what I have to do, but it's not necessarily legal.

Yeah, I'm gonna take care of it.
I'm gonna go say good night to the kids.
