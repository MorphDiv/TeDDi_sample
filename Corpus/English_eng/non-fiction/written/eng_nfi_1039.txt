Previously, on Andi Mack...
Hi, Mom.
How long will you be staying?
Okay, so much for the pleasantries, huh?
I wish you would just grow up already!
I have.
I'm here, and I'm raising my daughter.
I live for the day you tell me you're proud of me.
He's throwing it and you pass it...
What are you doing here?
You two know each other?
He's my dad.
You invaded my privacy, and you embarrassed me.
I wanted to surprise you.
Just leave me alone.
What was he doing?
Hey, it's Bowie here.
I just became a dad.
♪ No, I've never seen nothing like you ♪
Bowie!

How's that paper on the Lincoln-Douglas debates coming?
Good.
I'll finish it.
I just wanna watch this one more time.
You can watch it "one more time" as many times as you want.

Well, I miss him.

And now he hates me.
No, he does not.
Then why hasn't he texted me back?
I know it seems forever, but it's only been a week.
He's probably just giving you some space.
You'll hear from him.
When?
I don't know, but you will.
That's not comforting.

Hey, we got some good stuff.
I know, right?

Hopefully, one day I'll be a size nine.
I know that smell.
Like a cat smoked a cigar.
You brought home somebody's discarded clothes?
They're vintage.
They're moth-eaten.
Can I talk to you a second?
Okay, work with me here.
Andi's been moping around since Bowie left.
I finally got her to cheer up.
Can we please focus on that?
Certainly.
Don't say "certainly"
unless you actually mean "certainly."
Don't be disrespectful to me, Rebecca.
You are living under my roof.
It's my roof, too, Mom, in case you forgot.
Before you threw me out, this was my home.
I did not throw you out.
- I don't wanna fight.

I'm sorry I did.
I'm gonna go be with Andi, make sure she's okay.
Hey!

Please.

Oh, are we friends now?
Well, you're not calling me eleven-point-five anymore.
Only because it'll be confusing when that's my name, too.
You know, you get a real sparkle in your eye when you're overconfident.
I like it.
Ugh.

Don't you just wanna wipe that smirk off his face?
Do you?
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.

There's so much electricity between you and Marty, my hair's standing on end.
Or, it would be, if it wasn't such a thick, beautiful mop.
You two don't know what you're talking about.
Look, it's not a bad thing.
I actually think it's nice you're being a little... you know, less competitive.
I wanna race.
All right, you got it.
Ready?

I mean it.

Come on, Buffy.

Yes.

Okay, then.

I'm ready to win tomorrow after school.
I'll see you at the finish line... three-tenths of a second after me.
Clever, but I don't think so.
You'll be staring at my back the whole race.
In fact, let me give you a preview right now.
Did that sound flirty?
No.
I mean, maybe in the way the praying mantis flirts before eating her mate.
I was in a race once.

You wanna know how it ended?
You lost?
Obviously.

It's a painted line, guys.
I don't even know how I did it.
Did Jonah just pretend not to see me?
Wow, that was an actual ghosting.
I've never seen one in person.
Ghosting, scary concept.
What does that mean, that you're dead to him?
No.
Does it?
When was the last time you spoke to him?
I was behind my chair, in my thermal pajamas that I've had since I was eight!
I can't believe he saw me like that!
Right...

Or your finest pajamas.
Oh, Andi.
Hey!
Look, can I just apologize for the other day?
I didn't mean to flip out, I was just...

So you're not mad at me?
Why would I be mad?
I don't know.
I should've asked you before I just showed up.
And the whole Amber text thing...
Totally over that!

And you can come over anytime.
Come over today if you want.
Okay.

Really?
Yeah.

Uh, wait.

Oh.

But if you still wanna hang out, I actually could use some help.
I'm up for anything.

I have to get Amber a birthday present.
Sweet.
Andi!

Look at you guys, here!
Together.
We're getting a birthday present for Amber.
You remember her, right, Bex?
Jonah's girlfriend who's still his... girlfriend.
Yes, I do.
What a sweetheart.
So, Jonah, uh, what were you thinkin'?
I don't know!
Amber never likes what I give her, and... she won't tell me what she wants.
It's like this fun guessing game that we play that I never win.
It...

Like I said, what a sweetheart.
How about makeup?
She'd love that!
I...

I wouldn't know what to get.
Don't worry, I'll show you everything... on Andi!
On Andi?
Why on Andi?
Come on, this way.

This is foundation.
It helps minimize pores, just in case Amber's are a little big.
I mean, we can't all have great skin like this.
This highlights Andi's cheekbones.
Does Amber have cheekbones?

♪ I wanna tell it to the trees ♪
♪ I wanna hear it whispered back to me ♪
See how this makes her eyes sparkle?
♪♪
Not that Andi needs makeup, but sometimes it's nice to be noticed in a different way.
Right, Jonah?
Wow.
You look really pretty.
Thanks.
♪ Crazy as that dream might seem ♪
♪ Everybody loves a dream or two ♪
So many questions.
One of my track shoes is gone!
I don't understand.

Okay, deep breath.

Did you have your bag with me all day?
Yes!

Except for when I left it in Spanish and later in the cafeteria.
I know where it is.
I'm so relieved.
Marty!

Suddenly, not so relieved.
He wants to sabotage me because he's afraid I'm going to win tomorrow.
And you know what they say:

Okay.

And two...

Fine.

I wanna believe you, but that wild look in your eyes is making it difficult.
And the fact that you didn't respond to that last statement.
Jonah Beck said I looked pretty.
Can you believe it?
Of course I can believe it.

No, you're amazing.
How'd you come up with that makeover idea?
I know a little something about boys.
And, that one likes you, even if he doesn't know it yet.
You don't know that!
You'll see.
Someday you'll look back on this basket of baby taters and realize how smart I am.
Why did you have to leave?
What?
When I was a baby.
It's just, this is so much fun.
Boy talk, thrift shopping, baby taters... we could've always been doing this.
You could've always been here.
Okay.

Let's do it.
I won't dodge any more of your questions.
Oh.

I just wanna sit here and listen to you tell me how Jonah Beck secretly likes me.
Well, we might need milk shakes for that.
Waiter!
- You're late for dinner.

We already ate.
Are you wearing makeup?
- Not that much.

No Andis were harmed in this makeover.
I seem to remember that when you first got here, you said you'd only be staying for a short time.
What are you saying?
She's saying she wants me to move out.
Cece, no.

Bex coming back is the best thing that has ever happened to me.
Please!
Don't make her leave again.
Again?

Nothing, I swear.
Andi, it was your welfare I was thinking about.
It...

Mom!

What didn't you tell me?
And what was for the best?
Oh.
I get it.
You didn't leave when I was born.
You... sent her away.
No.
I... uh...
I tried talking to her last night.
She just wanted to be left alone.
I don't want her to think I sent you away.
Well, I know that's not what you think.
Because that's not what happened.
Mom, we've been having this fight for 13 years.
I've resigned myself to the fact that we'll never agree what happened.
But now Andi needs to know.
Well, we're not telling her your story.
Well, I certainly don't want her to hear yours.
Well, we gotta figure something out.
We can't just leave her stuck in his limbo.
I know.

What?
Nothing.
Have a good day.
It's happening.
My worst nightmare is happening.
What's happening?
She's turning into you.
And I can't watch.
Why would you wear all that stuff if you were just gonna take it off?
I was making a point.
- Which was?

Oh, that's good.

And Cece deserves it.
She sent Bex away without even asking me.
You were... a baby.
That's true, but it doesn't change how I feel.
And feelings aren't always rational, okay?
Mine are.
- You coming?

What are you doing?
I'm making a point, too.
An incredibly disgusting one.
Yo, Andi!
Thanks again for yesterday.
That was fun.
Sure, anytime.
I'm really glad you said that.
Amber loved the makeup!
But she hated my card.
"Happy Birthday.

It gets the job done.
She said she wanted more emotion-y stuff.
She gave it back so I can try it again.
Amber's really good at giving me second chances.
Yeah, that's, um, one of her many good qualities.
So, could you tell me what to write?
Just write what you feel.
I don't know how to do that.
I just need something really nice that sounds like I wrote it.
Could you help me?
Please?
Sure.

I have class right now, but, um... maybe later.
Awesome.

You're a great... pal.
What are you smiling about?
This.
Ugh.

They're not my sneakers.
Oh, no, you have that wild look in your eyes again.
Please tell me they're not...
My sneakers!
Of course.
Why do you have them?
And why are they wet?
You stole my shoe yesterday, so, I stole yours.
And they may have gone for a little swim in the girls' room.
I didn't take your shoe!
Oh, really?

No one.
It was in my mom's car.
Must've fallen out when we gave you a ride home the other day.
Wanna skip to the part where we're laughing about this?
No.
Is there something you wanna say to me?
I'll replace these.
Yeah, you will.

What's his problem?
Just a guess?

Why didn't he just say so?
Maybe he wanted you to come up with the idea on your own?
I can't be trusted to come up with ideas on my own!
Exhibit A.
- Hey!

What happened to your new look?
Was Cece freaked out?
Oh, yeah.
Then it served its purpose.
Are you looking for someone?
Nope.
Let's get out of here.
But I... don't wanna go home.
Me neither.
Great, so where are we going?
Home.
But I just said...
I thought you said we were going home.
We are.
This is where we live now.
What?
Welcome home.
Next, on Andi Mack...
What's going on with your pants?
Bex did the laundry.
It smells like kiwi.
It's like this adventure...
Did we blow another fuse?
That I didn't know I was going on.
We haven't spoken to Cece since we left.
It's not like we're still fighting.
I think you should call them.
I think she should call me.
Now it's more a game of chicken.
Can't you guys just move back?
I don't think that's an option.
Hey-hey!
