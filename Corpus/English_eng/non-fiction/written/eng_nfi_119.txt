That's the final scorecard for this game, the Mavericks have been clinical tonight and are now in second position.
The Hurricanes next play Hyderabad, and as for the Mavericks, their next one is the big one, the PPL's very own El Cl√°sico - vs the Chennai Legends.
Sorry, sorry!
Sorry, I...
You must be happy to be back here.
I may have been born here but I'm not from here.
I used to, yes.
Oh, so that's why they hate us - because you abandoned them.
Look, you come from UP and yet you play for the Mumbai team.
We're like the cheerleaders.
We dance for the guy who pays us most.
Get it?
Look at these assholes.
Look...
What does that poster say?
Traitor!
Vayu Raghavan.
Unpredictable.
Difficult to say if he'll agree or not.
He's been playing for the Indian team since last year too.
Leg break and the mystery ball... he uses the same grip for both.
That's why he is their strike bowler.
We have to find a way.
Check.
Found anything, Rohini?
Rohini, you have the worst poker face in the history of mankind.
We know you have something, so just tell us.
Sir, you're looking at the wrong clip.
Alright, I'm remote accessing your computer.
Have a look.
Did you see it?
Same action.
The action of the bowling arm is the same.
She is confusing the hell out of me.
Some bowlers unknowingly get into habits in order to bowl specific deliveries.
These habits develop subconsciously.
Look at Perera's deliveries - when he bowls leg breaks, his non-bowling arm clenches into a fist.
But when he's bowling his mystery ball, his hand is like this.
This could also be a signal to the wicketkeeper.
Is this true for all instances?
Sir, I've watched more than 200 clips of his bowling since last night.
And this is true for every single one of them.
Bingo!
Will the players be able to read it?
Sir, I think we can work this out.
If we do this, by God, we'll fuck them all!
Yes sir, f...
Vayu is a traitor!
Vayu is a traitor!
Niki, has that Ahuja finally invited us to the poster launch?
No Z, they're launching it online this evening.
Imtiaz is out of town and Ahuja sir is also unwell.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Sure, and I've also sent you the details of the Ozone Mobiles shoot in Chennai.
My pleasure, Z.
I was.
But then I thought, since I'm supposed to be running a team,
I should be here to see if you need... as in, the team needs anything.
Right.
You had an endorsement shoot, didn't you?
What the fuck is this, man?
All by yourself, eh?
Devender is our man.
In fact, he'll help convince a couple of guys for us.
He's fully reliable.
The Chennai guys always screw us.
Vayu, it's all because of you, asshole!
Incredible India!
Hey!
The pipe's broken!
What the hell!
Fuck!
The locals have peed all over the place.
Let's go.
Mr Bhatia, as per the contract, it's only a 5-hour commitment.
It's their problem if they run over schedule.
Hey, sweetheart!
How are you?
Hi.
What the hell are you doing here?
And you can thank me later.
For what?
Along with my favourite superstar, of course.
It'll be great to have you both in the Mavericks stands today.
Zarina, I am seeing you tonight?
For what?
Don't you know?
I've just got the Mavericks their biggest endorsement deal ever.
We're celebrating.
Ma'am, the Ozone Mobiles shoot got cancelled.
What!
What is it, Mr Bhatia?
Why did it get cancelled?
Conflict of interest, Zarina.
You see, the Mavericks will now be endorsing Blink Phones.
It's a far bigger deal than what you had with Ozone.
And of course...
I had to have my princess' pretty face on all the ads.
I wasn't consulted on this.
I'm just doing what's best for the team, Zarina.
Remember that little speech of yours at the stadium.
Next time leave your weighty dialogues on the film set.
See you later.
Congratulations, Zarina.
Mr Dhawan, you have no right to do this.
After an easy win against the Hurricanes, the Mavericks face a much tougher challenge against their traditional rivals, the Chennai Legends.
And as you can see behind me... they've been met with a rather hostile welcome.
Vayu is a traitor!
Vayu is a traitor!
I hope there won't be any trouble, Devender.
Come there.
Vayu is a traitor!
Are you a cunt or an asshole?
Do you want the money or not?
How would you like it if your girlfriend takes off with someone else?
Don't come whining to me later.
Done.
Done.
Raghunath will be very useful.
A wicketkeeper and an opener.
Good.
I knew it!
Stop stalking me, Vayu.
Meera, please...
No, but you can make it one.
Okay.
What was Sunil Gavaskar's test average when he retired?
Then tell me, who did Kapil Dev dismiss when he broke Hadlee's record?
I'm not Rohini!
Say the alphabets backwards.
Fuck!
Wait, let me just try again.
Are you trying to screw with me?
What did you expect?
Actually, I thought you wouldn't even talk to me.
You're kinda hard to let go of, Vayu Raghavan.
Yeah well, I get that all the time.
From my captain, that is.
Bastard!
Will you have me back, Meera Nagpal?
Whoa... back?
That's a big step.
I'm not going anywhere with you!
Plus, you're public enemy number one here.
Is that a yes?
How is that a yes, Vayu?
You didn't say no.
I am not leaving my room.
And you are not getting into my room.
Okay.
Hello..?
What room are you?
Come on in.
Oh, this is heaven!
Vice captain Litner.
He's addicted to pleasure but he's not a sell-out.
We'll have to convince the others.
But money alone won't do the trick.
We'll have to trap them.
Hamish McCall.
Our English fast bowler.
His case was looking difficult but I have cracked it.
I have been cheering your balls for two years.
D... darling... sorry.
I have something to show you.
So you like boys.
I like this one.
Doggy style.
Fucking hell!
I don't understand.
Pictures of?
Of us, Imti!
What the fuck!
Is my face on them?
No.
But it is you.
Good.
Okay.
What do you mean, okay?
Do whatever it takes.
These pictures can't be made public.
For our sake.
Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you around.
That's one foreign player in the kitty.
Did you cum?
No.
Why is it always so difficult with you?
How do you manage with that Sarah?
Coz she uses her mouth.
Just for saying that, you're finishing on your own!
This bitch mode of yours  it's what draws me to you.
I'm surprised at how calm you have been today, how you've coped.
Coped with what?
Shut the fuck up!
Have you seen the poster?
Yeah, well...
Wait, you haven't seen it?
Why?
Nothing.
Mr Handa.
The Chennai Legends are favourites according to me.
They're also playing on their home turf.
But having said that, the Mavericks have Arvind Vashishth.
And that man... that man can win matches.
Did you watch the Mavericks in their last match against Haryana?
That's called captaincy, yeah?
Not to mention his batting form!
Arvind Vashishth?
Strike him off right away.
I tried to get him when he used to play for India too.
Didn't work.
Shahana..?
You didn't come home or call or even text me on our anniversary.
So I thought I'd give you a surprise.
Surprise!
What?
Aren't you happy to see me?
You... you came all the way?
Of course I did.
I miss you.
I miss going on tours with you.
You know, I miss the hotels, the stadiums, the parties!
It used to be so much fun, no?
Why did we stop?
Would you like some water?
No.
I think I'll hit the mini bar instead.
My friend Jack's here.
Do you want some?
Oh, I forgot.
You don't drink before a match.
Sorry, my bad.
Maybe...
Cognac.
I did come home on our anniversary.
I'm sorry I was late but I did come.
Who needs a glass!
What are you doing?
Preparing to get wasted.
What did I say?
The Chennai organisers made us sweat.
The nets, hotel... everything was crap.
The arrangements are okay but the practice ground...
Did a pipe burst flood the ground?
Oh, right!
Those motherfuckers!
If you beat Chennai, my team gets a chance to make it in the top four.
So, if you need any help, don't hesitate to ask.
How could you do this to me?
How could you not put me on the poster?
You okay?
Hotel Chennai Royale is very fortunate to have the Mumbai Mavericks staying with us.
Let's kill these Chennai cock-sucking motherfuckers tomorrow, aite?
He's erratic too.
I've sent someone to speak with him.
This one is.
You want to buy a house in Cape Town?
For wife and children?
I have one offer.
You benefit, I benefit.
Partnership?
You killing my chill!
Fuckwit!
Junior players are easy to pull.
They are vulnerable and they come cheap.
Here.
Hey.
What did I tell you?
You're not entering my room.
I'm not entering.
You stay on that side of the door, I stay on this.
This is the least Chennai's best filter coffee deserves.
In that?
Hold this.
I'll take this.
For you.
Cheers.
This is not a date.
Of course... not.
Yes, I'm fine.
Keep practising...
Yes, I'm training every day.
Are you playing tomorrow's match?
Screw Chennai!
Screw Chennai!
Screw Chennai!
Screw them!
These bastards come from Mumbai and spread their filth around here!
What did you say?
They may have bought a team worth 3 billion but their brains are worth shit!
Why do you guys bark outside the hotel every year?
Our Chennai heat is much better than your shitty Mumbai heat.
Keep your hands off!
You will ruin everything.
Okay, okay.
I think you need a refill.
Yeah?
Here.
So they... they...
They said they'll fix it.
Arvind, I don't care how good the Chennai Legends are.
We have to win the match.
We need to win this match.
It's all I have.
I know, Zarina.
I know.
Madras style.
Yeah.
Here you go.
Vayu...
Yeah?
Good night.
Ma'am... we have a problem.
Who started this?
Just a while ago, you guys were fighting like thugs.
And now, you sit here, heads down like decent men!
Listen... all the damages will be taken care of.
There's no way you can throw us out like this!
Who started the fight?
Bastards!
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
You haven't lost the Ashes yet, mate.
Shit, Shahana!
Shit, mate!
You okay?
Hello?
Yeah, Mr Handa.
We're just leaving.
I don't know how to thank you.
It's only a hotel, Ms Zarina.
I can get you a hotel anywhere you want.
You just have to beat Chennai at any cost.
Great.
Now we're doing favours, eh!
It's an investment.
And I'm sure, there'll be a handsome return some day.
If we can control all these people, we can control the game.
When would you like to begin?
This press conference needs to be cancelled, Mr Dhawan.
Yes, but I thought I'd see you in action.
This is your team.
As you said yourself, I am new here.
You've been here for six years.
So I thought, you should go face the press.
Now go clean up this mess.
Bag, please.
Ma'am!
Ma'am, what happened at the Mavericks after party last night?
Is it true that the Mavericks players were unruly and violent?
Ma'am, why are you not on your film's poster?
I am here, in my capacity as co-owner of the Mavericks.
We will not be taking any questions today.
I will now make a statement.
I have been associated with the Mavericks for the past six years, and in all this time...
She's good.
People sometimes forget that she can be an actor in real life too.
And?
And the process has started.
In fact, we launched the poster yesterday.
What was her expression like when she saw it?
Fireworks!
Ah!
The little pleasures of power!
Alright, work.
Where are we with Prashant?
There's a small problem there.
Devender has pulled Raghunath in.
Anees is already in.
And Hamish..?
Imtiaz!
Sorry.
Your boy.
He needs to take us seriously.
Next time his photos will be on the news.
You tell him that.
Everybody leave.
Are these people trustworthy?
'I'm fine, darling.'
No?
And never ask me that question again.
Do you really think that I can do what I'm doing in plain sight without being careful?
I need to explain something to you.
This isn't some ordinary, regular, betting and fixing operation.
What you are witnessing is a master crafting his masterpiece.
It takes time.
It's almost a shame that no one will ever get to know about it.
Alright?
Now... would you like a drink, or should we just fuck?
