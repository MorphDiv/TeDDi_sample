MARY JANE:

Meet Lee's baby mama.
- KARA:

He's got two kids already anyway.
He's a 40 year old man.
If he ain't got some kids and some hot exes, we'd be worried.
Mom didn't tell me my new babysitter would be so cute.
[laughs]
Your post with Orlando Lagos was so cool.
I showed it to everyone at school.
Really?
He's one of our favorite players.
- How do you know him?

He's just a friend I met at work.
You are both on internal suspension.
You get to decide which you wanna keep... your word or your job.
♪ So good, so good, so good, so good ♪
♪ You know my love is ♪
♪ You be, stuck on it 'cause my love so good ♪
♪ So you, keep comin' back to get some more ♪
♪ Got you in your feelings, all emotional ♪
♪ My love, my love ♪
♪ So good, so good, so good, so good ♪
♪ You know my love is ♪
♪ So good, so good, so good, so good ♪
♪ You know my love is ♪
- ♪ My love ain't running out ♪

- I know.

- Please, Zoe.

I hope you don't mind.

- [kissing]

- MJ, this is Zoe.

You both know everything about each other, so...
ZOE:

Oh, God, is this real?
Yeah.
I haven't felt real leather in years.
You know, Lee was just telling me how you met.
- Well played.

We... tell each other most things.
Lee always does like it when the woman is in charge.
- [laughs]

I don't mind being the boss in this relationship.
You know what?

You two must be having a lot of sex.
Okay, let's change the subject.
Yes, please, Jesus.
Uh, where are your kids?

Oh, Katherine's at the ballet workshop and Aiden's back at the hotel watching videos.
I'm sure the porn bill will be astronomical.
I'm sure he'll be telling his friends how New York City was amazing.
LEE  ZOE: [laughing, palm slap]
- That boy.

That's perfect.

Thank you.
Mind the sodium, Lee.
Oh, no, it's all good.
Has he told you about his little high blood pressure problem?
MALE SERVER:

LEE: [chuckles]
Okay, so how serious is this whole blood pressure thing?
It's one small pill every day, that's all.
Okay, then why didn't you tell me?
I'm telling you now, okay?
Okay.

I don't have any medical issues.
But you obviously have some issues.
Yes, I am in the doghouse at work, but...
Look, I know.

Zoe can be a handful for anyone.

Especially meeting her under these circumstances.
Okay, there's this question that is just shouting at me so loud in my mind.
Now I'ma ask it exactly the way I'm hearing it.
Why the hell aren't you two together?
- Oh, come on.

I've heard about this whole conscious uncoupling thing, but y'all take this to a whole nother level.
Put to one side for one second the fact that I love you, the explanation is very simple.
She cheated on me.
So, she stepped out on you and you just drew the line.
Look, commitment's very important to me.
Once that trust was broken...
- Is it really that simple?

Do you still have feelings for her?
Look, in a way, of course.
She's my best friend.

And, no, it wasn't easy, but, look, I'm just not interested in her.
Does she have feelings for you?
♪
LEE: [sighs]
PJ:

Ava, why did you send me this?
You wouldn't answer my texts.
And, besides, you two were so cute.
Ava, I don't know what you think you see in me.
I see the child my mother wishes she had instead of me... the one taking my place in her business.
Cut to the chase, all right?

I wanna throw a kick-ass party and I wanna use my mom's place.
And, for that, I need your help.
This is such a bad idea.
We need to get the doorman on board and codes for the elevator.
Ava, you and I both know your mother would never go for this.
That's the whole point.

You planned this.
Yeah, but that's gonna sound so lame when you explain it to my mom.
Yeah?

- Really?

No way I'm helping you throw a party.
You don't want me to show this to her, right?
No, I do, and then she'll figure out just how crazy you are.
PJ, you can't be that naive.
My mom is in love with you.
[laughs] You're funny.
You really think that Rolex is about your business potential?
If I show her these photos, it's over.
I don't care.

Okay.
Wait.

I thought so.
Now, what time should I put on the invite?
Coming up after the break, Ronda, we'll hear about how driving that old gas guzzler might actually be good for the planet.
MARY JANE:

KARA:

- I've been texting you.

Are you sure, honey?

What are you talking about?
- Yeah.

Ronda's got me running around on this McAlister thing.
- I bet.

Oh, bookings I'm logging in.
That's only half the pile.
Justin's got the rest.
I'm sorry, honey.

- Wait.

I haven't even had a chance to tell you about
- Lee's uber-hip baby mama.

Well, I promise we'll go out for drinks.
We'll catch up once this craziness is all over.
All right, and I'll answer your text once my phone wakes up.
I've gotta get these done.
- RONDA:

I'll be right there.

_
Oh.
How long have you been chatting with my kid?
Uh, I dunno.

He sent me a funny meme and we started chatting.
What do you talk about?
Mostly just about how great you are.
- Right.

Right.

Oh?
I can barely get my son to return a text message, but you guys talk so much, you get a fire emoji.
That's... that's nice.
Isn't this a good thing?
No.

The women in the hoochie mama dresses, the drinking.
Orlando, he sees that. [tosses phone]
- Everybody sees that.

You told me that I should be seen at these places because it's good for my brand.
What's good for your brand and what's good for my son is not the same thing.
Scott reached out and I responded.
Scott knows we're having sex, Orlando.
He thinks we're a couple.
Is that a bad thing?
Yes.

What do you think his friends are gonna say?
I don't know.
You don't know.

I don't know.
I was just trying to treat him like one of the guys.
What would you like me to do?
[heavy sigh]
Do not talk to my son on social media at all.
LEE:

For example, my girlfriend, she's a grown-up, you know?
She's mature, she's beautiful, she's very accomplished.
I don't think she'd mind me saying she's almost 40.
AUDIENCE: [laughing]
That's what we call a grown-up.
AUDIENCE: [laughing]
But her mother insisted I sleep in the guest bedroom.
And, yet, her mom felt the need to protect her daughter's innocence, whilst her granddaughter is sleeping in the house, living there rent-free with her two children who she had with two different dads... [voice fading away]
♪
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Lee Truitt.

Thank you.
AUDIENCE: [applauding, cheering]
MALE HOST:

Give it up for my man, Lee Truitt.
Good style, brother.

Grab a drink and get yourself comfortable.
Up next, we have one of the Alley's favorites...
Hey, what's up?
You didn't like the set.
Come on, the audience loved it, admit it.
You popped off about my niece and her kids?
I didn't say anything Niecy would object to.
No, if she was here, she'd be real salty about it.
Why?

No, you might as well have.
No, I'm very careful about that.
All kids are legitimate.

There are so many born out of wedlock, we ought to stop stigmatizing them.
If you ask me, it's the bloody institution of marriage that's illegitimate.
I thought commitment meant so much to you.
It does.

I didn't realize you were so against it.
Well, until now.
Okay, so, what exactly do you believe?
The institution of marriage is dated and hypocritical.
Hypocritical.
- I see...

Look, how often does 'til death do us part actually mean until the divorce is final?
- [laughs]

First Zoe and now this?
This is... this is a lot, Lee... all at once.
♪
So, anyone who worked with McAlister and Elmore during that time is suddenly unavailable.
Mary Jane's interview the other day send off warning flares to anybody in the know.
Yeah, and I'm sure McAlister got to a few of them as well, so...
It's tough not having Justin's source, you know, to help us make sense of these facts and figures.
Maybe we should try a different angle... like a statistician.
You don't give up, do you?
No.
I really appreciate your professionalism.
Don't try to sweet talk me.
Make no mistake...
I know where your allegiance lies.
I'm just here to do my job.
[sighs] And your side keeps growin' every day.
What do you mean?
I'm afraid having Justin join the team may have been a mistake.
I now see that he's the type of guy that would sell out his own mother for a story.
Yeah.

KARA:

Should I be worried?
MARY JANE:

It was taken two minutes ago and he's drunk off his ass.
It's not even cocktail hour yet, you know?
Kara Lynch, as I live and breathe, are you jealous?
Girl, please, please.
No, absolutely not.
I just have two boys that follow every single move this guy makes and they think their mom's involved in some kind of fairytale fantasy romance with him.
- That's all.

[heavy sigh]
I don't think I can.
Well, I think I may have some news that can distract you.
I think I may have found Justin's source.
Yeah, a clerk that used to work for Judge McAlister.
Oh.

Well, are you gonna give it up when you find out who it is?
Absolutely.

Oh, wait, Kara, I've gotta go.

[mixed conversations]
- Hey.

She is not gonna talk to you.
Justin, what the hell?
How did you even know I was gonna be here?
Are you keeping tabs on me?
Maybe.
Look, my source gave me a lead.
I can share it.
I've just gotta know you're not gonna
- share it with Kara and Ronda.

What's it gonna be?
I'm in.
♪
What?

You said that this would be a mutual meeting spot.
You... you live here.
Is there a problem with that?
No, I, um...

Do you have something permanent?
I closed escrow three weeks ago.
Of course, you did.
Well, you know, we should just focus on the matter at hand.
- Don't you think?

My... my source was a legal clerk for McAlister back in the Charlotte days.
Now it took her a while, but she was able to track down the ex-convict who was railroaded by McAlister... who's also on his way here.
You invited a convict here?
I didn't know it was your suite.
And he's not a convict, all right?
He's a wrongly-convicted man.
McAlister is the one with implicit bias, not me.
- Are you sure?

Let me do the talking and you'll see.
I don't know.
Do you think he's the kind of guy that can relate to a woman with a $10,000 purse?
Justin, you knew how much my purse cost, and you somehow think you're more relatable than me.
Really?
With your tailored shirts and your designer shoes.
Don't come here frontin' like you're from the projects.
I actually did live in public housing.
I also lived in a four bedroom house with a pool.
My father was a car salesman.

We lived all over the damn place.
I pride myself on being able to talk to just about anybody.
Lecturing people isn't the same as talking to them, Justin.
I don't lecture.
I strive to listen more and speak less.
We can't agree on anything... certainly not that.
I bet we can't agree on the color of the walls.
I think... aubergine.
It's more of a boysenberry.
I just proved my point!

Thank you.

We cannot agree.
This is insanity.

[sighing]
Well, I think that's something that, uh, we can both agree on.
[knock at door]
- I'm fine.

You the reporters?
Come on in.
How did you wind up getting arrested?
I wasn't no saint as a teenager.
I did what I had to survive... which, at the time, meant hooking up with the wrong crew.
So, suffice it to say, the cops knew who you were.
And I knew them, too.

There come a time a kid got served on my block.
A regular kid.
Just happened to be wearing the wrong jersey.
He got killed.
Took a bullet to the head.
The cops put my photo in a line-up and she picked me out.
She shot tears out of her eyes on the witness stand.
And that's when I knew...
I was goin' to prison.
So, you didn't do the shooting, but you were prosecuted for it.
She was straight up wrong.
But she wouldn't let it go.
A lot of people are in prison for similar crimes, who, as you know, say the same thing.
I wasn't even there.
I was with a friend.
I had a solid alibi witness and Judge McAlister knew it.
But they made up some felony charges against my friend and then threatened to prosecute him if he testified on my behalf.
Can anyone else corroborate this?
My witness.
But he's dead now.
He was shot in a crack house 11 years ago.
Is there anyone else?
Yeah, McAlister bragged to my attorney that he knew my witness was solid.
But he was determined to put me away for everything else I had done.
Let me get this straight.
The man that's about to be nominated for the Supreme Court knew there was exculpatory evidence, but chose to prosecute you anyway?
He was happy to finally find something, anything to put on me, whether it was true or not.
You know what I feel like?
Like I was in prison for who I was, not for what I did.
Why didn't you come forward earlier?
Coming forward is risky.
I did my time straight through.
I went for unconditional release over parole... which meant I could have a new start.
Now I've got a job, a young family,
I've got a church community.
Not many people other than my wife know about my past.
So, I've got a lot to lose.
Linger on his face just a little longer.
Not many people other than my wife...

- MARY JANE:

MARY JANE:

JUSTIN:

You know Garrett's gonna give this story to Ronda.
He almost said as much.
You've gotta stand up for yourself.
How?
That's for you to decide.
But I will tell you this... you've gotta make your own luck in this business.
You read Ronda's autobiography, right?
I did.

Exactly.
What?

I need this job.
Okay.
What do you need more?
A job or a seat at the table?
It's for you to decide, but whatever you choose, I'll back you up.
- Oh.

Please tell me you're not using the back door because you're hoping not to run into me.
I'm using the back door because I'm on suspension, and I hate running the gauntlet on the way in.
Okay, then, let's get you off suspension.
Tell me, how did it go with, uh, Justin's source?
- Oh, good.

Great, actually.

- Oh, boy...

Here comes the crazy.

Justin and I are working the story in secret and we're gonna take it straight to Garrett.
So, you're not gonna give me the information?
- No.

- It was Justin's.

So, what?

What about your promise to me, Mary Jane?
What choice do I have, seriously?
I either go along with Justin, or I watch Ronda use my material on air and win another Peabody.
The two of us could have come up with a solution together, Mary Jane.
I'm sorry.
I'm on suspension and it's screwing with my head.
Watch your back.
Don't trust him.

Gee!

ZOE:

MARY JANE:

ZOE:

I recognize her.

You're dating a model.
I wouldn't care if she were a waitress.
This relationship is like nothing I've ever had before.
Really?
Have you ever felt like you've found your soulmate?
Like the other person knows everything about you already and is still willing to explore new things and grow with you.
I think so.
I finally found that person.
And I'm delighted that Lee seems to have found his, too.
Well, that deserves another round.
- I agree.

Yes, yes, more, more.
You've gotta let a bitch know when you're gonna kiss 'em, though.
That's... that's some shit.
Now I've got a job, I've got a family, a church community.
Not many people other than my wife know about my past, so, I've got a lot to lose.
So, uh, there it is.
- Ronda, Kara, get in here.

Not a word.
- What's up?

Mary Jane and Justin have interviewed a gentleman who Judge McAlister wrongly convicted.
While on suspension?
It's a bombshell of a story.
We can't have our team working at cross purposes.
It's unprofessional.
Weakens us all.
GARRETT:

The network will pull out all the stops and will make sure that this story goes to air in a major ratings boosting roll out.
It'll be a major scoop which reverberates throughout the Congressional Committee, and Ronda will present every word.
Okay, wait a minute.

I know you and Mary Jane are close.
If you want to step aside, I can find another producer.
- No, I'll do it.

You don't have a choice in the matter.
I do have a choice.
You give Ronda this story...
I resign.
Immediately.
Wait a minute, Mary Jane, come on.
This is our story, Kara.

From the beginning.
You planned this?

Not all of it.
Is there anything else you wanna say for yourself?
If Mary Jane walks, I walk, too.
Today, it's one surprise after the next with you guys, huh?
Maybe I was too hasty.
Taking into account the unexpectedly strong feelings involved...
That is crap!
...I think the team that landed this whale
- should take it to air.

I mean, what do you have?

That does not a pattern make.
Come on, it's not like, you know, it's gonna dent McAlister.
Please, Ronda, don't demean yourself.
A minute ago, you were panting to be the one to take this out.
MARY JANE:

Mary Jane and Justin will do the story, and that's final.
Wow!

GARRETT: [clears throat]
And, guys, that trick works once with me.
You pull that again and you are both out on your asses.
- KARA:

MARY JANE: [laughing]
I was so worried about you for a minute there.
It's about time I scored a win against Ronda, right?
That was a frickin' great move.
- Oh, my God.

- Hah!

Are you sure you're okay with us doing it?
Yes.

A win for you is always a win for me.
Good.

Of course.

So, what about you?

What?
Have you solved your problem with the ballplayer?
Oh.

I'm gonna have it out with him.
I...

I don't wanna talk about that.

Did you pass the baby mama test?
I just have to survive one more going away dinner, but the kids have signed off on me.
Ooh.

Except for one.
I still don't know where he stands on having more kids.
Oh.

Where do you think?
Do I have to draw you a picture of my shriveling uterus?
I don't know, MJ.
You should really think about that one because having some kids will make you think twice about pulling that move you just made in there.
True.

But the relationship is moving along.
It's nice to talk about these things.
Wow.

I know.

And I'm not done yet.
RONDA:

I'm very disappointed in you.
Somehow I knew that might be the case.
I brought you here.
And you completely let me down.
You took your big foot and you stomped on what could be the biggest moment of my career...
It wasn't your moment, it's not your story, and you know...
No one does that to me and gets away with it, do you understand me?

Oh, you picked your side, huh?
Well, you'd better hope it's the right one.

Your interview was flawless.
Thank you.
Oh, and, uh, word just came in from the White House.
McAlister has called a press conference for tomorrow in Charlotte.

That's what one powerful story can do.
Your story was powerful... so powerful it cost me money.
I don't follow.
Your victory motivated me to stop futzing' around with my contract.
My agent and I had to leave a little money on the table, but... mmm, what's a few dollars against the security of a five-year contract.

Mmmm, great job, though.

No.

Why?

Is that why you had to push back?

I'm very grateful for everything that you've done for me.
But I think it's time for me to move on.
I'm sorry.
PJ, wait.

Gluten free soy mac  cheese, or broccoli noodles?
MARY JANE:

All right, cut it out, you two.
Wait.

- Oh, major win for Mary Jane.

LEE: [laughs] I agree.
Do you know... do you know the best thing about my trip has been to find you so chill in person, Mary Jane.
Well...
It's so different from the way you are on TV.
Well, you have opened my mind as well.
I mean, you know, I can only hope that one day Lee and I can actually get as comfortable as you and Lee.
- LEE:

Well, that's worthy of a toast, huh?

- Hear.

[glasses clink]
ZOE:

Lee and I are because I'm going to really open up myself here and ask for a huge favor.
We're not having a threesome.
I'm serious, Lee.
So, Karen and I want to have a child together.
- Congratulations.

We'll use her egg, which she has frozen, and I will carry the baby, so I can participate in the birth.
LEE:

And we really want this new baby to be connected to their older siblings in a special way, so...
Karen and I would like to know, Lee, will you be the sperm donor?
