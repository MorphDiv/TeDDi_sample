Previously on "The Magicians"...
They know everything... who you are, what you have done.
You cannot go back.
What am I supposed to do?
What we all do.
Decide.
- Hey, where's Kady?

I don't think Penny even cares that she's gone.
Believe me, he does.
We're gonna make another you.
You sleep here, your mind goes into the golem.
The test was positive.
I want an abortion.
It's a totally mundane procedure.
Is it?
'Cause it might not be a simple, totally mundane human embryo.
Stop.

So sorry about this.
That's my Haxenpaxen!
Just imagine what it's giving off magically.
We're invisible while we're near him.
- Kady!

What's with Stink-master Flash?
- He's coming with us.

She could help with the baby situation.
They may be able to help your friend with her problem, but listen, I would never, ever do business with them if I had a choice.
Your majesties, the much-venerated Emissaries of our neighbors to the north.
I present Prince Ess of Loria.
- You fucked with us.

- You fucked with our castle.

And now the High King and I hereby declare war on the kingdom of Loria.
Yes!
Wait, really?
I cast the niffin summoning, and you didn't come.
You're wrong.

I killed you.

Your cacodemon wasn't powerful enough to kill me.
It tried.
But when it saw that it couldn't win, well, let's just say it stuffed me in a place most convenient... that stupid tattoo trap on your back.
We're stuck with each other.
Oh, Quentin.
We're gonna have so much fun.
Stop ignoring me!

Pay attention to me, you miserable sad sack!
- What's wrong with you?

Are you ready to let me out of that hairy back of yours?
'Cause I'm never gonna stop.
And sooner or later, one of these dummies are gonna call the brain police, and you got priors.
This is not Alice.

This is not Alice.

Just keep telling yourself that.
You have got to stop.
Fine.

Okay, look, Alice...
Evil Thing Inside of Me That Used to Be Alice...
I have to say the words to open the trap.
Of my own volition.

And I'm not going to do that because there is one policy for you out here, and it is to box you up for eternity.
I'm kind of boxed up right now, in you.
It's not the same thing, and you know it.
Block of wood isn't trying to fix this.

Save me?

You think I want that?
I think if you were really you right now, that's all you would want.
Oh, what, and you're the world's foremost expert on all things me?
Based on what?
Our garbage fire of a relationship that ended with Eliot's dick in your mouth?
Look, you came really close to fixing this once for your brother.
I thought I did.
But I was like you then.
Small yet weirdly arrogant for somebody who didn't understand magic at all.
If you would just work with me instead of jabbing at me, we could figure out what's missing.
We could make the spell work.
We could do this.
Listen to me.
I promise, the math will never add up, Q.
You'll never get that girl back.
Everything that's missing burnt up when I became this.
It's gone forever, Q.
This isn't good for either of us.
No, no, this is making me saner by the second.
I don't want to hurt you.
I actually don't want to hurt anyone.
Bullshit, you're a niffin.
Q, I'm not bloodthirsty.
I just want to be free.
And I already told you I can't do that.
Fine.

I'll be good.

No, that's crazy.
So I have to be a niffin, yet I don't even get to be a niffin?
I could travel the universe.
I could see things you couldn't even imagine, but instead, I have to be bored and stuck with you!
I'm sorry that it is torture to be with the one person who is trying to help you.
So go back to screaming until you go insane?
- Is that your choice?

That's your choice.
Or you could be quiet.
And you can let me try and solve this.
Well, this is the place.
Of course it is.

I mean, Goldie said they're legit.
Only one way to find out.
- Problem?

We're just discussing how to handle your situation.
That's okay.

But you can abort it, right?
This is exorcism.
That thing is not human.
The longer it's inside you, the more tangled it gets with your essence and the harder it is for me to help you, you understand?
Okay.
Then I exorcise the trickster for you.
After you pay.

$1 million?
In gold.
Paper money is for drug dealers and idiots.
Look, Goldie will tell you I'm good for it.
Can you just do it now and we'll pay you later?
Bars.

Maybe 60 pounds.
That's all.
What?
No, I'm just...

Okay, well, cash won't cut it, so, what, pawnshops?
A million dollars in chains and earrings?
I mean, that would take so many pawnshops.
We might as well rob a bank.
Well, we are Magicians.
Why don't we just rob a bank?
So there's really no way to just... take it all back?
Your Majesty, one cannot simply take back
- a declaration of war.

Because I don't.
There are Lorian troops marching to the border.
They're days away.
We believe they intend to penetrate Fillory by way of the Grudge Gap.
And, of course, our preparation is affected by the continued...

Okay, well, we've got literally every engineer in the kingdom working to de-shit-inate the Wellspring.
Gonna invent the guillotine in a hot second if they don't get their shit together.
Everyone is doing their best, my queen.
We expect to clear said water shortly.
We're excessively optimistic.
Spare no expense.
Which brings me to my point.
Fixing the Wellspring is expensive.
War is expensive.
And at this time, we do not have the funds necessary...
We're broke?
It's magic residue.
Probably from a ward around the bank's underground vault.
It's a regular bank.
Regular banks have magical wards?
Ones connected to the Federal Reserve do, yeah.
Okay, so how do we get past it?
- Shit, it's...

Hey, we can't just let it out.
If...
What the fuck?
Oh, my God.

I think it's dead.
What the hell was it besides huge and invisible?
Fuck.

We should bury it properly.
Okay, but, Jules, we got to move, okay?
We really need to get somewhere safe.
Okay, like?
You're not gonna like it.
Have you seen the "Twilight" movies?
Specifically the last one?
No.
Huh.

Your problems extend beyond your uterus.
The fetus' élan vital is... entangled with your soul.
I mean, I have read about this, but I've...

You will need to find a Mudang.
It's their area.
Yeah, we did.

Yeah, tell me about it.
I've been trying to get one on staff for years.
That poor girl is fucked.
And you are suggesting?
Let her stay.
I know that you expelled Kady and that you are not generally keen on granting asylum, especially to hedges.
Yes, well, this is a special case.
Julia and I have a past.
Handle it however you want, but for the record, that girl will be safer at Brakebills.
Mm.
"How to transfer the energy from one being"
"and transform it."
Hey, what... what are you two doing here?
What?
What's this bitch doing in my room?
I know.
This was her room, right?
I guess they haven't moved her stuff yet, but Fogg said space was limited, so...
I talked to Kady.
What, no respect for the dead, Q?
You're just gonna let her sit on my bed?
Jules, I don't know what to say.
Say what you're thinking.
That I'm cursed.
Must've been a serial killer in a past life.
Yeah, raise your hand if she's the reason that you fucking exploded in this life.
I'm sorry for everything that's happened.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
For everything that you're going through.
Mm, now you're just lying to her, Q.
I'm sorry.

- Yeah, because you blame her.

If I'm being honest.
No, if I make you feel so shitty, just go.
- No.

I'm the reason.

'Cause that doesn't feel right either.
I don't know what's right.
My best friend in the world does crazy shit and doesn't trust me and doesn't listen to me.
It is not that simple, and you know it.
I don't...

You guys are both so goddamn maudlin.
I promised you, in Fillory, when you told me about Reynard, that I would help you somehow, and that is not a promise that I intend on breaking.
So if there's anything that I can do...
Actually, there is.
Help us rob a bank.
Oh, my God, yes.
You say yes.
It's for Professor Mayakovsky!
It was destroyed by other books.
"Future Movements of Magic"
was written by a Polish scientist who happened to be a...
What?
Jew.
So the eugenics books came for it.
I'm really sorry.
They've been put in the restricted section with the other anti-Semitic texts.
Hey.
I'm...
Long story.
Anyway...
There's our little king.
So how have you been since, um...
Uh, I'm managing.
Um, how are things with you guys?
Glad you asked.

Also, Fillory is seriously, dangerously stone-cold broke.
Wait, how is that even possible?
The Nugget Beetles of the Outer Islands, they literally shit precious stones.
Going extinct, apparently.
Ember shitting in the power grid really screwed us in a cornucopia of ways.
And before you ask, yes, every alchemist in history is a lying, cheating illusionist.
They turn lead into gold.

So we are boned.
How would you guys feel about robbing a bank?
Whew.
So... what are you really up to?
We need to rob a bank.
A bank heist.

Hmm, I think the time we've invested in him may actually pay off.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, first, there's something I have to tell you.
You're not gonna like it, but hear me out.
For Julia?

The victim of a fucking rape by a trickster god.
Look, I got to do this, okay?

So?
You gonna ask the traveler you just fucked the shit out of to help?
I mean, no, I didn't really feel like I had the right.
That's noble.
But ask.
Not gonna lie, I always wanted to rob a bank.
To our little thievery corporation.
PS, we still hate you.
But it's the 21st century.
Shouldn't be this hard for a girl to get an evil demigod abortion.
And we're emotionally advanced.
We can hold resentment and sympathy for a person at the same time.
And Fillory's broke.

So lucky you.
Thank you.
Okay, uh... so if this heist is happening, any ideas as to how?
Well, we cased the bank.
There was a pretty gnarly ward around the vault.
Who here's actually robbed a bank?
When was this?
Senior year of high school.
I had some issues.
Okay, listen up, 'cause I'm only gonna go through this shit once.
Any bank worth robbing uses one of a handful of security systems.
All the usual bells and whistles.
But what most idiots don't know is, those companies are all owned by Magicians.
Wait, so the people that work there...
Clueless.

They're all Muggles.
They have no idea the vault has a secret feature.
Serious wards.
Designed specifically to keep out Magicians.
Now, in the case of our target, their fingerprints control the alarm systems.
It takes two managers scanning their prints simultaneously to do this.
Once both the alarms and the wards go down, you've got ten minutes to get downstairs, past the armed guards, and enter in the correct ten-digit combo.
If you screw up the combination or you take longer than ten minutes, you're fucked.
Now, basic bitches trip all the standard alarm systems, but Magicians?
We also trip the magic wards, which means... battle Magicians.
Full-time security employees on the DL, with benefits.
You see one, run.
They only ask questions post-mortem.
But our ace is you.
Once we nab prints and drop the wards, you travel straight in.
You really don't think a bank vault, of all places, has anti-traveler protection?
Oh, they do.
The entire floor of the vault is one big anti-traveling sigil.
You get locked in till you run out of air.
Yeah.

Relax, dummy.
You only get stuck if you hit the floor.
Oh, so it's like "Mission:

That movie was stupidly unrealistic.
It's so much easier to just levitate.
Yeah, I don't know how, and in case you guys have all forgotten,
I can't do magic.
Oh, that's fine.

It's a little thingy any Physical Kid can make in their sleep.
Gravity belt.

Once we drop the wards, float Penny, he zips in, he zips out... payday.
Julia, run!
It's there.

- I thought it was dead.

- Kady, come on.

- Kady!

- I'll be fine.

- I need its spoon.

This is yours, isn't it?
You sent those things after Julia, didn't you?
See, this is what happen when you don't pay.
Jehn-jang.
- Lady, use your words.

This is for dokkaebi.
How you say... goblin.
Invisible, right?
- Yeah.

This is very old magic.
You bring to life using old, abandoned things, like this wooden spoon... and menstrual blood.
Probably Moon's.
These creatures are mercenaries.
They won't stop.
You kill one, another one grows in its place.
Very fucked up.
Why the hell would she do that?
To kill your friend.
I told Moon to relax, but she's all, "Baby's too evil."
"It might hurt more people."
She wants to play it safe and kill both spawn and mom together.
She's so stupid.
You won't pay if your friend is dead.
Listen, we are trying to get you the money, okay?
If you want to get paid so fucking bad, tell her to call it off.
Can't.

Dokkaebi will not stop until trickster baby is dead, so you got two options.
I can exorcise for you, or monster rips your friend's head off her neck.
So hurry up with my gold.
Hey.
What's that?
You remember that one time
Richard and the Free Traders rewound time?
- Déjà pizza?

I think this is how they did it.
That was heavy cooperative magic.
Yeah, well, there are notes for version 2.0 here.
I mean, it's more efficient.

Either one of us could run it.
Let's see.
"The Quarterback"?
Goes back 15 seconds.
Get it?

Yeah, Richard did like his dad jokes.
Anyway, I thought it could be useful, but at this rate,
I won't actually get it to work for weeks.
And I guess I'd be weighed down lugging it anyway.
It's got a pretty small radius of influence.
Julia, you can't come.
What?
Those invisible blood-goblin things, they won't stop coming.
I mean, not until your problem's dead, meaning you are.
If you step out from under these wards...
It'll find me and all of you.
So I'm supposed to, what, just wait here, fingers crossed, while everyone who blames me for Alice's death risks their life?
I mean, how does that even make sense?
Just 'cause you can't come doesn't mean you can't be there.
You can listen in and watch.
All right, but if anything goes wrong...
Nothing will.

Librarian, Neck Beard, and White Privilege.
They're the managers.

The good news is, they all go to the same lame bar after work.
I'll take White Privilege.

Oh, nut up.

Walk up to him, grab his hand, and say, "Can I borrow this?"
Dip his stupid finger in his drink to sanitize it, and... pop it in your mouth, walk away, yet stay emblazoned on his heart for a lifetime.
Done and done.
Fine.
Why does it got to be Kady?
It could be Penny or Eliot.
- Or you.

Sounded like volunteering.
- Okay, fine, I'll take the librarian.

Great.

Thanks, Q.
So he really just stuck that in your mouth?
Yup.
That is how the spell works.
Damn.
Unexpectedly, I'm somehow turned on right now.
Oh, really?
- Look at this idiot.

Took you long enough.
So show us the goods.
Oh, God.
Oh, that's bad.
How'd you get it in your mouth?
Oh, it wasn't with your mouth, was it?
- Wh...

- Oh, shit!

She went Digital Underground?
- Oh, God.

What else do we have to do?
With these, we're golden.
Margo and Eliot grabbed everything else we need for the morning.
So go rest up, Goldwater.
You've earned it.
All right.
Stick to the plan precisely, and we should be golden.
I'll be right here waiting, engines running.
Of course you will.
The brains of the operation drives the getaway.
- Everyone knows that.

Okay, bitches.

- Thanks, Jimmy.

Ah!
Good luck.
All right.

Okay.
Three, two, one.
Okay.

It's up to Penny now.
Let's go.
Wait.

Ha-ha.
Oh, shit.
Shit!
God damn it.
Fuck.
Fucking Physical Kids.
Penny's only got one minute.

Cutting it a little close, don't you think?
So where's the booty?
Eliot, who are you talking to?
They can't see me.

I'm incepting your ass!
Your head.

You're still asleep in Fillory, remember?
That is overly complicated.
You know what's not?

Oh, that is not good.
Eliot, what's going on?
How do I put this?

No, it's your stupid device.

Penny's incepting my... never mind.
Just trust me, we have to get him out of that vault now.
Or, say, sometime in the previous ten minutes.
Fuck.

Shit, let's go!
Tell her I'm fine.

Well, way to mix the message.
Hey, Margo, keep the engine running.
I'll inform the bank manager the bees are resisting extermination and everyone needs to stay clear a little longer.
Let's go, kids.

- Shh.

You...
- you are bad.

- Oh, shit.

- Guards.

I got this.

Wait, you're not gonna...
Kill them?

The Wrecking Ball is a weapon of peace.
Trust me.

Read the book, and then you watch the movie, and it's always just whiny.
I'm totally disappointed in the book.
Mind if I read you?
Stop it.
Stop it!
Whipped that up trying to get anybody to dance at our cottage soirees, but it came on a bit strong.
Shit.
There's no way we can pick this lock.
Maybe we can brute-force it.
Hold on.

Okay, just so we're all on the same page, we've got less than four minutes.
Penny!

I don't even think Alice could do this in under four minutes.
Maybe not then, but now I could do it in 15.
Seconds.
Oh, well.

Well, I guess I could help.
For a price.
I want to drive.
For an hour a day, I get control of your body.
Okay, okay.

I don't even know where to start.
Well, we can't just stand here!
I wouldn't hurt anyone.
I just want to stretch the tiniest bit.
Breathe.
You set the terms.

so that I can't break it.
Okay. 30 minutes.

After we hash out the "word as bond."
Great.
You try anything crazy...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Is it a deal?
Fine, it's a deal.
Are you talking to yourself?
No.

Yes.

Move.

I've always been good at math.
- Hi.

- Okay.

Princess rescued.
Let's collect our reward and go.
Yes!
Oh, shit.
Q, stop!

Shit!

- Let's go!

Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Go back!

Shit.
Oh, shit, shit, shit!
Well, why should I go out there first?
You're the battle Magician.
What about another Wrecking Ball?
It was a one-off.
Oh, shit.
You're the... the battle Magician.
- Wait, did we just...

Yeah.

I'm outside.

The effect reaches far enough?
Listen, you only have four rewinds.
Julia's outside.
She's watching with a machine that can rewind time.
Let's go!
You're the...
Kady, three rewinds left.
She can only go back 15 seconds.
Let's go!
- You're the...

Penny!
Kady, last rewind.
Okay, look.

Okay.

You all run left.

Is she?

15 seconds!
Let's go.
Kady!
Julia.
Julia, answer me.
Shit.

Q, come on.

- But...

- What about...

Eliot's fine.

Eliot?
Eliot!

Guards!
Julia.

Jules.

- Talk to me.

Talk to me.

It's gonna be fine.

- It's gonna be okay.

- Julia.

- Julia.

Julia?
Hey.
No, don't move around too much.
Sun patched you up, but it's gonna take a while.
Did she do it?
Did it work?

Yeah.
She did it.
But, Julia... there was a complication.
