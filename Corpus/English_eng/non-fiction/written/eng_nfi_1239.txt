So remember, if your attacker comes at you, you gonna panic?
No.

And then you're gonna be clear to pummel the groin.
And... you're dead.
Wow.
So inspiring, right?
I'll tell you what I'm inspired by...
- Those tris and those bis.

And that's why I call it self-defense...
For moms!
'Cause, as moms, we have a natural instinct
- to want to protect our young.

Maggie, you've got a young daughter at home.
I do, Cookie...

Her name is Charlotte, and she's a fierce warrior.
What's up with that voice you're using?
Is this your married partner?
Nope, I'm Emma, I'm the best friend.
I moved home to help her raise the baby...
When I kicked my cheating husband to the curb.
- That's right.

- I need a moment.

What's happening?
This right here is the definition of friendship.
- That's right.

That is the most powerful thing that there is.
Now get on up here and attack each other.
- All right.

What...

Well, Cookie, hold on one second.
This is my first class, so I don't think...
Don't worry about it.

- Okay.

Yes, Cookie.
All right, you're at the ATM.

Emma, attack.
Beep, boop, beep, boop.
Ooga-booga, give me your money and also your body!
- You're dead.

- Nice, Maggie.

Remember too, your forearm is a five-way weapon, okay?
- Five ways?

- two, three, four, and five.

- That hurts.

- So let's sit down, and we'll...

Really?

Maggie, you're at your car.

- Okay.

Uh, okay, um, Mags, let's just take it easy...
Ah!
You're dead!
She's still alive!

- No, no!

Why are you still talking?
Yeah, that's right.

Oh, God!
You're dead.

For moms.

I think you snapped my solar plexus.
What?

You were attacking me at an ATM.
I just think you could've been a little nicer about it.
- And, oh, you're dead!

Sorry, I can't resist.
Maggie, you were incredible in class today.
You're like a human machete out there.
Well, you sharpened the blade, Cookie.
Look, Thursdays around 10:30 p.m.
I hold a special class that's called "The Cookie Jar."
- Mm-hmm.

I'd like to invite you to join.
Oh, my God, can we make that work?
Yes, of course we can make that work.
Okay, good.
I give every member of The Cookie Jar a nickname.
- Okay.

And there's Nutter Butter, Double Stuf, Shortbread, and now Gingersnap.
- Oh, I love it.

- she's a red head?

- until she snaps!

- And Emma?

- This is for you.

Is this for being most improved?
I've been teaching this class for 17 years.
I have never had a student with less
- natural ability than yourself.

You are a danger to yourself, so I need you to forget everything that you learned here today, okay?
- That won't be a problem.

Perfect.
Do you really think I have no physical strength?
Hey, she didn't say strength, she said skills.
And yes.
- Wait, is that Mark?

- That's our car.

Oh, my God, this is ridiculous.
What's this a ticket for?
- "Being too sexy"?

Oh, God, is this what it's gonna be like with you guys together?
'Cause I'm not interested.
What is this a ticket for?
Being the best friend?
- "Tags are expired"?

- I'll see you tonight.

- I'm not paying this.

You have a woman's handwriting.
Can I ask you a quick nursing question?
- Yeah, shoot.

Ugh, if I had a nickel.
The short answer is yes.

- or even just natural slope.

Yeah, sometimes a penis can take a slope to the right or to the left.

- Oh, okay.

I think tonight Mark and I are gonna do it for the first time.
- What?

What about all that hot and heavy stuff on the porch?
I thought you guys would've been all over each other.
- It's been a couple weeks.

He said, and I quote, "I wanna do this, but I wanna take it slow."
- So, since then, there's just...

Been a lot of dry humping and starting meaningfully into each other's eyes.
Sign me up for a good dry hump, right?
Although there is a lot of chafing involved.
But it's been 15 years since I've seen, you know, it, and I just don't know if it's gonna be, like,
"Oh, hello, old friend," or "Oh, God, what happened to you?"
Well, I would be more worried about him seeing my body, you know, 15 years later.

Things are very different.
God, I hadn't even thought about that.
- Oh.

Would you be disturbed, or would you welcome it?
Is that a special move I'm not aware of?
Tell me, does it feel... does it feel tight, is there reverb?
Whoa, wow, we, uh, we can come back.
Oh, no, no, no, I was just trying to see if my butt had changed since college.
- Well, this is 40.

- Hi, baby girl, are you hungry?

- All right.

- Dive in.

We got some carrots.
Uh, hey, Mags, might I have a word?
Uh, yes, you might.
Well, it's been approximately six weeks since we took Joanie and Cha-Chi to the carwash.
- Are you talking about sex?

What?

Anyway, since that wonderful night, I've been feeling...
Oh, no, no, hey, Bruce, we talked about this, right?
- It was just the one night.

- It's, uh, I met somebody.

- I mean, that's great, yes.

- Okay, Bruce, focus.

- I'd love to meet her.

- Yeah, of course.

Maybe I'll make some of my famous apps and we can throw some games in there.
- That'll be fun, right?

- Oh, pigs in a blanket.

All right.
You did not have to make me dinner.
I haven't ever made anything other than a DiGiorno's pizza.
Well, I'm sure it's delicious.
Okay, here we go, right?
All right.
Bon appétit.
All right.
Now, is this a chicken or a fish?
It is a chicken.
Mm, can't wait.
Okay.
- Ooh, there's a crackle.

What is this?

Rice Krispies.
It's a Rice Krispie crusted chicken.
Mm, did you come up with that yourself?
I did.

And is this a dessert or a side?
- It's a warm banana.

Halved... microwaved for two minutes.
- Hmm.

- Oh, 'cause it's...

Take some water!
- Mm.

No, no, no, no, I'll just munch on this dry pasta.
- No, no, it's okay.

You know what?

- What?

- and cue up some music.

Oh, what?
- Okay.

Taking you back to the day?
Oh, you slid into it.
Ooh, you miss these old moves?
- Oh, yes.

Come on, yeah.
Yeah, that's my lady.
I haven't heard this song since the first time we...
- That's right.

Oh, man, we did some bad things.
Do you remember that?
Every detail.
Every detail.
Mm, no, no, no, I gotta keep you working for that, mister.
- What?

- What?

- find that troll.

No, I'm sorry, I think I just need it to be more spontaneous.
- That's all.

You know what?

Oh, I thought the microwaved banana was the dessert.
Settle down, 'cause I got these.
Red Vines!
I thought you said Red Vines be nasty.
Well, some things you come around on, you know?
Hey, Mark. "Happy Feet"!
- What was that?

He's...

Hey, Dave.
I'm in the middle of something, buddy.
"Happy Feet"!
- So no sex?

with a divorcee named Dave.
Oh, that's tough stuff.
- Hey, no, Ma'am.

I only have three backup trays of those pigs in a blanket, okay?
Okay, you need to relax 'cause this is way too many apps.
- Mm-mm.

Bruce's girlfriend.

- Nancy.

I'm sure she's very sweet, okay?
And I would just like her to feel welcome in my home.
A lesser woman might be freaked out about meeting their ex-husband's new girlfriend.
- Not this old gal.

I'm very happy for them, and I think it's gonna be good for all of us.
Well, I feel good about having some of this
- seven-layer dip now.

- Oh, ah!

God, I'm not gonna get physically attacked at my own apps table, you psycho.
Well, you just did.
You gotta be ready, okay?
'Cause 94% of attacks happen in your own home.
- Cookie?

- Nancy?

This is just blowing my mind.
I mean, Cookie is Nancy, Nancy is Cookie?
Yeah, what are the chances, right?
I mean, there aren't any, but here we are.
I didn't even know you guys knew each other.
Yeah.
- Maggie's in the Cookie Jar.

A little different than the Cookie Jar you've been digging in every night.
Okay.
How did you guys possibly meet?
I was in a Party City on a Friday night,
- as one does...

- Buying myself a piñata.

End of a hard week, you just string up a piñata, whack the crap out of it, and it rains candy on you.
- It's the best.

Cookie, you were also buying a piñata?
Yeah, I mean, what are the odds, right?
When two people who both love piñatas find each other?
Very unexpected.
'Cause, you know, normally I date, you know, really tough guys, right?
- It's what I would assume.

MMA fighters, and large animal vets, but, man, none of those guys made me laugh like this man.
- You're a party in a bottle.

And the physical part is just... it's, um... seamless.
When you say "seamless," what do you mean by...
- Well, we need more apps.

- ends and yours begins?

- Is that what it is?

- Who wants more apps?

I'll get you some then.
Oh, my God, can you believe it?
We thought Nancy was gonna be some terrible woman who was like, "my Crock-Pot," and instead, it's Cookie!
You must be so psyched.
- I am so psyched, really.

Charlotte's fifth birthday would be like, right?
- What are you talking about?

"Hey, Cookie's here!"
You wanna slow your roll?

They're not gonna last.
She's like the perfect physical specimen, and he's just, you know, Bruce.
It makes now sense at all, and, at the same time, it kind of makes all the sense in the world.
I mean, look at them.
Like two hippos wrestling in the wild.
Oh, that's a classic viper hold into a Chinese handcuff.
Man.
We learned that two weeks ago.
God, she's good.
Oh, we didn't learn that one.
We should not be watching this.
And I am all alone.
Officer Rodriguez, at your service.
Mark, what are you doing here?
I'm being spontaneous.
I slipped in through the window, "Dawson's Creek" style.
- No, you didn't.

You better come over here, girl, 'cause I don't wanna wait.
There is a former MMA fighter named Cookie downstairs.
Well, then we're gonna have to be quiet, huh?
Hmm.

What if we were to do it in the dark, dark recesses
- of the closet over there?

- Okay.

Oh, God, there's some stuff in there, sorry.
Oh, wow, there's a lot of stuff in here.
That's gonna make for a tight fit.
Yeah, you know, that'll only be sexier.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

- I can't... ow.

- Emma?

- What's going on?

It's Maggie, shh, shh.
- What is going on?

I'm dying down there.
I thought Cookie would wanna see my old hockey stick, you know?
Remember how good I was at that?
Stop it, stop it, shut up.
Shut up, there's someone in here.

I don't hear anybody.
You shut your mouth for once in your damn life if you wanna survive this night.
- I think we're okay, I mean.

Maggie, you're being ridiculous.
Okay, there is a man's footprint, a formal wear shoe, look at that.
All right, Mags, it's just...
- You're dead.

Oh, my God, Mark!
Oh, oh, my larynx.
- My larynx.

- My larynx.

I thought you were an intruder.
Gingersnap, don't you ever apologize for your strength.
Got it.
Why were you in Emma's room wearing a tuxedo?
Hey, man, I was just trying to sneak in and surprise my lady.
That's very romantic.
Excuse me, I have to take a moment...
What's happening?
'Cause that was beautiful.
Hey, I have an idea.

One moment, Gingersnap.
I have to say something.
Oh, Bruce, I have spent most of my life closed off to intimacy, protecting myself, but, since we've met, I've learned to open up and lay down my emotional weapons.
I love you, babe.
I love you too.
You know what I love?

What?
Oh, yeah.
- Games!

♪ Open yourself up and love some games ♪
- What are you doing, Mags?

♪ Some games ♪
We could play Skalagoes, huh?
Honey, I don't know what you're saying.
Hey, scribble Scrabble, where's the piece at?
- Something is not right there.

Okay, so, "I'm just a girl, standing here..."
"Notting Hill." "Notting Hill"!
That's it, yes!
You should've just said Julia Roberts.
Emma, don't tell me how to play the game.
Okay, fine, fine, fine, go, go, go, go.
- Turn it up, turn it up.

This is a place where they're growing dinosaurs, and children and their families come and visit.
Why would you bring a dinosaur back to life?
- What's the movie?

Electricity's gonna go out, and then all hell's
- gonna break loose.

- happens, but say the movie.

- use its claws to open a door.

And then you'd be like, "Ah!"
- Oh, what was it, babe?

- Nuts, I didn't see that one.

We should put that one on our cue though, right?
- Sounds scary.

- Yes.

Here you guys go.

- Ready to rock this thing?

- Duck.

- Yes.

- "A Golden Pond."

How are they getting these?
- Icicle.

Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."
Chicken.

"Turner and Hooch."
- That was amazing.

All right, you guys get up there.
- Maggie, why don't you go?

- I don't have a partner, so.

- Come on ..., we're all doing it.

You said you were open to loving some games, right?
- Come on.

Get up there, let's game it up.
All right, games.
- Yay.

Team of one.

- All right.

You're gonna crush it, Mags.
Okay, okay, shh, shh, shh.
Okay, everybody's forgotten about you!
You're all alone, you're all alone!
Your only friend's an old man!
Nobody cares about you!
- All by yourself.

- It's just you!

- Nobody wants you!

And everyone forgot about you.
Stop it!
Just stop it, for God's sake.

- What, what?

Everybody's found their special someone
- except for this old coot.

You guys can't get your hands off each other, and that's nasty.
And you guys can't get your hands on each other.
Well, just get it over with and do it.
At least you're not all by yourself in your home alone.
Well, that's it, Mags.

- I got... got what?

"Home Alone," that was the movie.
- What?

Why didn't you guys just go "ahh"?
It's the poster.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, those apps still have some life in them.
- They're cream cheese.

Mags, what is going on?
Do you still have feelings for Bruce?
No, of course not.
Well, then are you in love with Cookie?
'Cause I would understand that.
I don't know, I'm just...

Everyone has someone except for me, you know?
Okay, well, I thought you weren't ready for that.
Well, I wasn't, but I...

- Maybe I am.

And, just so you know, if you wanna get out there, all I have to do is put out an APB.
- Let me handle this one.

Why don't you get involved with Mark's peen.
No, 'cause guess what?

Do you really think, when you take your clothes off, that he's gonna run the other way?
No, he's gonna jump on you like an old hound dog.
What if I just wear Spanx during sex?
What do you think?
Mark, I wanna rock your body all night long in so many different ways.
Not right now, we're watching "Happy Feet."
- Dave, hit the road.

- Really?

Ugh, I wish I had somebody to rock my body.
You will again, man.

See you later.
- Mark, I am so sorry.

The warm banana?

- No, I loved that.

- No, that was...

Listen to me.

And I think I just got worried that this part wouldn't work.
What are you talking about?
You haven't seen this in a while.
Emma, I can't wait to see this.
I know, but things are different, you know?
They're a little wider and longer.
You think this isn't different?
- Come on, man.

That wasn't there before.

Get your hands in there.

- All right, all right.

This mole here?

You should get that checked out.
And, I'm sorry, check out these chicken legs, right?
I'm just going straight chicken leg situations.
It's a two-piece meal.
So yeah, it's different.
But have you ever thought that it might be... much, much better?
Get over here and get on top of my body.
Mags, mark and I did it!
We did the sex!
And it was even better than before 'cause
I got moves now, y'all.
Adult moves.
What is this?
"Dear Emma, you must be hungry from all the sex.
"Please enjoy this plate of artisanal cheese.
Love, your best friend, Maggie."
Oh, she knows me so well.
You're dead!
Ah!
