(woman moaning)
Oh, it's just a splash.
Craig, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm just looking at pornography.
They took the Internet away from my computer, so...
I thought you guys got fired.
We got a little behind on our scripts.
That is the same thing T.J. said right before they fired him off of "Toilet Monsters."
Uh, Melissa McCarthy's videoing...
It's... it's on your computer, too.
Craig, you gotta go.
Okay.
Hi!
Hi.
Uh, Missy, you're on with me and Hugh and Larry.
I'm on a plane.
Uh-huh.
Does she know that she's on a video chat?
Should we tell her?
Hello?
Uh, yeah, Mooch, you're...
Do you know you're on video chat?
You get so famous, you forget how to use a phone?
Actually, I'm not sure where the speaker is, or if it's...
If it's toward the top or the... the bottom, but, um...
Okay, you wanna dial them back now.
Technical errors, beep, beep, beep.
Listen, uh, Ben had me read "Mr. First Lady"
and...
I have to say, I loved it!
'Cause people don't always think
But the fact that you wrote it for him, guys, that's a biggie and I think he may have mentioned some lady in a pink hat maybe playing the president.
Uh-huh.
And I have to say, I love the idea.
I would love to do something where I wear suits.
Here's the thing, guys, just full disclosure,
I am slotted to do this really exciting project with Vin Diesel.
Kind of a think piece, and, um... he's playing George Washington and I will be playing Betsy Ross.
That's funny.
But I don't think if that works out,
I can do two political movies back to back.
Oh, that's a real movie that you're talking about?
You were serious.
Oh, yeah, very real.
"Is it a real movie?"
Oh, my gosh, yes, it's so super real.
So it's real.
I mean, it still may be tricky because Vin's is a political piece, yours is a political script, and can I do two political pieces back to back?
It's a tricky situation, but the important part is that Ben is so excited and Ben is in and Ben is your Mr. First Lady.
Well, uh, you know, that is an important thing, but you are an important thing also.
I wouldn't say one's more than the other.
Ben's just as important, but-but...
But the two of you together, it's like, perfect.
And definitely, you're more important.
It is so cute.
Ben has been playing around with different accents.
He's doing this kind of Australian meets Cockney.
I mean, and the best part is, I can't understand, like, 99.9 slash 100 percent of what he's saying.
Like, you can't tell what he's saying at all.
Ah...
Oh, uh, okay.
I know, that's what makes it so funny, right?
I mean, I'm telling you guys this.
Oh, it's amazing.
He's just walking around the house, hello children!
On the barby with you.
Ah ha...
Yeah.
You know what?
Maybe my character is also from Australia.
So the president of the United States would be from there?
I know that, you know, technically, yes, the president of the United States has to have been born in the country.
But that's where the spice can come in.
You guys have built the cake, I'm giving you...
I'm giving you the spice and maybe the frosting.
And really, you know, why do people like cake?
For the spice and the frosting.
Whatever you tell us to do, we will do, you will be funny no matter what.
Including if you do a normal accent.
You know what I want to make sure I set up?
And Ashley can help you with this.
You have to meet with my dear friend and producing partner and force of nature, Howard Lang.
Do it soon!
That's what I want.
What if he asks who our representation is?
We don't have a literary agent.
We could say my commercial agent.
In case he wants to cast us in a commercial?
Oh, what about your brother-in-law?
Uh, I don't have a brother-in-law.
Yeah, you know, the guy that's married to your ex-husband.
What do you call that?
The guy that's married to my ex-husband.
Uh, Kenneth?
Ethan Flaum.
Yeah, he'll never represent us.
He has huge clients and we don't even get along, so, no.
Sorry I'm late, I had to drop my son off at rehab.
Now, who's Hugh, who's Larry, who's Rachel?
There you go, hey, Larry.
Oh, hello.
You look like a Lea Michele except without the frown.
Come on in.
Here, sit down, you're making me nervous.
Well, you have a beautiful home.
Thank you.
It was built by Oakies during the dustbowl.
So you're friends with Melissa?
Uh, oh, well, did you read our script, "Mr. First Lady"?
I don't work with first-time screenwriters.
Does Melissa know that you don't work with first-time screenwriters?
Okay, look.
Melissa is a sweetheart, heart of gold, wants to throw a bone to everybody, but she's also scary as hell and she told me that she has a lot of notes on your script, so you're gonna have to rewrite your screenplay,
incorporating all of her notes, and then a studio's gonna get involved, and they're gonna have notes, and trust me, their notes are not gonna be the same as Melissa's notes, and then if I get involved, I'm gonna have notes.
Because you've never done this before.
Phish.
You like Phish?
I do.
That's a Phish poster.
You wouldn't know it unless you were a Phish fan.
I was at that show.
My favorite is salmon, but I also like cod.
Swing and a miss, honey.
Anyway, you guys seem like very nice people, but let's be honest.
You're only here because of Melissa.
She obviously loves you as much as she is capable of loving anything, but you're new to all of this.
Do you even have an agent?
Ethan Flaum.
I didn't think he represented first-time screenwriters.
I do think Melissa's Betsy Ross Vin Diesel thing is gonna happen, because it's a slam dunk.
(coughs) Sorry.
That's great.
(laughing continues)
Ethan's not gonna represent us.
Can't he just say he represents us, even if it's not true?
No, 'cause he's not a nice person.
He's intimidating and mean and he thinks I'm, like, this needy ex-wife who calls Michael in the middle of the night to come over and kill a spider, which I did one time because it was absolutely a brown recluse,
so no, I'm not gonna call him and, like, ask for his help and feed into his perception of me as, like, this crazy neurotic nightmare, I'm not gonna do it.
We gotta do something, because Howard is gonna read the script and he's gonna love it and he's going to call Ethan on Monday.
(making ticking noises)
You are the reason for the ticking clock.
No, that's weird, you don't even know him.
It's fine, I'm gonna see him Saturday.
I have to drop Lois off at their house for that stupid horse show and I'll just say...
You know, I don't know what I'll say.
Well, I'm sure that'll work out.
Yes.
Will one of you drive, though?
'Cause they live in the hills and it's so windy.
Do you not have a steering wheel in your car?
No, I have a steering wheel in my car.
No, I don't have anything.
It's a link to a video of a Phish concert.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Write back.
Write back what?
Something about your stupid noodling band.
It doesn't matter.
No, because then he's gonna write back and then I'll have to write back and it never ends.
I don't need another friend.
It's already enough pressure with you guys.
Okay.
Well, oh, you invited Pat?
Hey, Pat.
Rachel, haven't seen you in a long time.
I know.
Still doing the single mom thing?
Yeah, still doing it.
That sounds isolating.
You doing any, like, Internet dating or anything?
I'm not Internet dating.
You're not doing Internet dating.
No.
If you ever do decide to do it, just a word of advice,
I would leave out any mention that you have a child.
Just because, you know, when a guy is looking at a woman's profile and he sees that box checked, there's all sorts of things going on in his head and he recognizes, all right,
here's a woman with some back-story, some issue, right?
The glaring thing, the thing that really jumps out is like, here's a moment that this woman had in her life with the most important thing possible that could every happen to her has already happened, and she blew it.
I'm so glad you made it out tonight, Pat.
There you go.
Good to see you, man, how long you been a member here?
Oh, we just joined.
Look at me, I'm sweating like a fat pig and I haven't even started working out yet.
You work out here a lot?
I try to work out every morning.
Maybe we could be workout buddies, keep each other motivated, man.
Maybe, yeah.
I'm just gonna get some water real quick.
Hang on, you gotta listen to this, man.
Oh, God, you're gonna put that in my ear.
Is that Phish?
Yeah.
I got a little bit of a sinus infection.
Oh...
I think it might've been David Sanborn.
There was a lot of saxophone.
I had that thing in my ear for, like, a minute.
And he never mentioned our script?
And did you ask him about our script?
I did not because I just needed to find some rubbing alcohol to pour into my ear hole.
I like that sound.
That is the sound of a funny Fartleman script being written.
Can I sneak a peek?
Well, I do not want to get in the way of the creative process, but give me the broad strokes.
The Fartlemans go to Australia.
Down "undah"!
Oh, you guys are so funny, I love it, great.
When are we thinking, end of day?
Connie says it has to be end of day.
Great job, guys.
I'm gonna be home late again.
Yeah, I suppose.
Saturday at 10:00, should I tell him that you guys are coming with me?
Oh, my God.
I told Howard that I'd work out with him Saturday morning.
Larry, you're the one who said we should go together?
I would love to cancel.
No, you can't cancel.
So much pressure.
What are we gonna talk about?
Talk about that dumb band Phish and our script.
God forbid this nightmare of a movie about an Australian male first lady actually gets made,
Howard Lang will be the producer.
Idea storm.
I have been thinking about this since I left and I cannot stop laughing.
What if you guys did something where, when you fart in the Southern Hemisphere, it comes out your mouth?
Oh, did Daddy get another new car?
No, that's Moddy's car.
Moddy?
My Other Daddy, Ethan.
Oh!
Stupid.
Rachel...
Daddy!
Come here.
Hey, is there a very pretty princess who's excited to see Cavalli this afternoon?
Yes.
Oh, I was talking about me, but okay, I'm glad you're excited, too.
Where's Moddy?
You working today?
Probably gonna be very weird.
That's a lot of Ethan.
How come you never wanted to photograph me?
Uh, probably because I have zero interest in the female body.
We did food trucks before anybody else
What does that mean?
Ugh.
Ethan Flaum.
Lucky you.
Really ramped up to weird fast there.
Are you kidding me?
You started it!
Oh, he started it.
Can you please drive me home?
I cannot drive on these streets.
They're so windy!
I will not drive you home because that makes no sense, because we didn't drive up here just stand in a doorway!
I can't go anywhere unless you drive me!
Did you forget something?
Yes, the reason we came here.
Dammit.
Hello?
(phone line ringing)
Answer your phone!
(beeping)
That's high intensity interval training.
You go super hard super fast and then you quickly recover, and then you go super hard, super fast again.
And so you always want to be... shocking your body, otherwise, you'll plateau.
So, you wanna talk about our script?
How do I do it?
I just put it on level 20.
That's the highest that these things go.
Yeah?
Woo!
Rachel, you have put me in a really uncomfortable situation.
Howard Lang is a huge producer and you're risking my reputation.
Your reputation would be threatened by representing us for one phone call?
That's a lie, you just lied!
Oh, my God, I would have a more rational argument with Lois.
I'm a grown woman who can take care of herself.
That's my car outside.
And who drove it?
I'll go get her a Xanax.
Ugh.
Please tell me you're not dating her.
No, no, no.
She's, uh, insane.
He just gets on my nerves.
Well, he gets on my nerves, too, but I love both of you.
Guess who just bought this house?
Can I tell you something?
She was crawling around on the roof the other day.
Ethan said he'll do it.
I explained the whole situation without acting like a complete lunatic.
You ever think about dating Hugh?
What?
Do you know what I think?
Hugh looks like a sexy homeless guy.
We haven't talked about our script yet.
Oh, my God, wow, we are way over.
Jump off.
I thought it was great.
I think Melissa should do that instead of that Betsy Ross Vin Diesel thing.
I don't really buy her as Betsy Ross.
Don't ever tell her I told you that.
So what do we do next?
Should we do another one of these bursts?
You get on there, do another burst and I will let you know when to stop, okay?
Hello?
Ethan says if Howard calls, he's gonna say he's our agent.
Well, that's great because Howard is gonna call because he loved our script.
Shut up!
I will not shut up.
Because my new workout buddy Howard Lang is going to be the producer of "Mr. First Lady."
Turns out he's extremely easy to talk to, it's zero pressure.
He's actually a lovely, lovely person.
Sounds like someone made a friend.
Wonder when our movie's gonna come out.
What about maybe Fourth of July weekend.
Isn't that when all the big ones come out?
Or Memorial Day.
You know what I would do, actually?
I would wait 'til the State of the Union and do, like, a cross-promotion kinda thing.
A-okay.
Oh, my God, I feel so alive!
We want compliments, give us the compliments.
