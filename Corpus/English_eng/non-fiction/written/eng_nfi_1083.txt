Morgan Freeman:

Was run down, working hard in school, not eating properly, and i got pneumonia, and an abscess developed on my lung.
Well one day the abscess burst and i hemorrhaged.
I needed blood.
Pretty sure everybody thought i might die, obviously i didn't.
But some say that god saved me.
Believers think god communicates to us through miracles.
That miracles are proof of the divine.
Now I'm going on a journey to discover the power of miracles.
You fell from up there down to here?
What did the doctors say?

To me it has to be a miracle that he can look out for all seven billion of us.
So when i heard about alcides Marino i had to come to New York and hear his story.
Well here we are.
Eight years ago, alcides came to work as a window washer at this 47 story tower in Manhattan.

he and his wife have a new life in Arizona, where they're raising their family.
He's still trying to understand whether god has a plan for him.
Why me, does god has a purpose for me?
Alcides wonders, "why did i survive when my beloved brother did not?"
Why, i mean is there some entity that makes that choice?
Or is, do we live with randomness, just pure mindless randomness?
For christians, miracles are proof that life is not random.
They believe god intervenes in the world for a reason.
Jews also believe in the power of miracles.
In fact their faith was built on a bedrock of divine intervention.
I've come to Jerusalem to see how Jews celebrate the miracles of their exodus from Egypt.
On a night that's different from all other nights.
Passover.

Come on, everybody sit down.
One of the most important traditions in judaism and this has been ordered to us from our ancestors, thou shalt not speak on your cell phone during the seder.
So we have a cell phone basket here.
Rabbi Maya:

And the word Nissan comes from the word nissim, which is miracles.
It's the month of the miracles, which will symbolize the beginning of the Jewish people, and the people as an entity.
Yoel zanger:

Morgan Freeman:

Let all that are hungry enter and eat, and all who are in want come and celebrate the passover.
This year we are slaves, next year we shall be free men.
♪ [All singing]. ♪ the passover meal is a celebration of the bond
Jews feel with god, and it's an occasion for children to understand the foundation of their faith.
The seder recounts how the Jews escaped slavery.
Thanks to god's striking the Egyptians with a series of ten plagues.
So rabbi...
Rabbi Maya:

Morgan Freeman:

Rabbi Maya:

Morgan Freeman:

But this was not the only divine sign.
Rabbi Maya:

God made two miracles, one was splitting the sea before the hebrews, and then closing it before the Egyptians.
So god wants us to remember the Egyptians are just his sons as we are, so by putting drops of wine on our plates
we're actually putting drops of sorrow that god had lost so many of his children while saving the others.
Morgan Freeman:

Divine will is not easy to understand.
So what is your take on the whole idea of the series of miracles?
Rabbi Maya:

I wish somebody would bring peace to us today, but the Bible is not a book of history.
The Bible is a book of ideas.
The question is what can we learn from it?
What can we take into our own life?
It's a way of saying thank you, you know.
It's a way of teaching the kids that every small thing is not granted, that you need to say thank you.
It's nice to have parents, it's lovely to have a roof above your head.
Morgan Freeman:

Rabbi Maya:

That's the story.
Morgan Freeman:

Not all modern Jews believe in the miracles of passover, but these stories still define them as a people, and that deep well of tradition and moral strength has sustained them, been called on by them for thousands of years to get them through hard times.
Around the world belief in miracles gives people strength.
In Mexico City the basilica of our lady of Guadalupe marks the spot where the virgin Mary is said to have appeared to a peasant 500 years ago.
In Hong Kong, Buddhist pilgrims flock to the statue of guan yin, who they hope will Grant them medical cures, a spouse, or good grades.
And in Rome miracles can turn ordinary people into saints.
I've come to the Vatican to understand how the catholic church verifies miracles.
I think the first time i was at the Vatican was about 1983.
I'm meeting monsignor Marcelo Sanchez sorondo, the head of the pontifical academy of sciences.
So let's talk just for a moment about miracles, do miracles really exist?
For instance Jesus walking on water.
Marcelo Sanchez sorondo:

Each page of the gospel is a miracle of Christ.
To consider a person is Saint the church needs a miracle.
Morgan Freeman:

Marcelo Sanchez sorondo:

Morgan Freeman:

Pope John Paul the second became a Saint in 2014, after two women who prayed to him after his death claimed to be miraculously cured.
One of Parkinson's disease, another of a brain aneurism.
The Vatican spends years investigating these claims, sometimes decades.
The church has a devil's advocate who goes and whenever anybody claims to have seen or experienced a miracle, the church sends the advocate to investigate.
Marcelo Sanchez sorondo:

Morgan Freeman:

Marcelo Sanchez sorondo:

Morgan Freeman:

Not just in matters of life and death, but also in the ups and downs of our daily lives or does everything that happens happen by chance?
Morgan Freeman:

Like a poor boy from Mississippi ending up in Hollywood.
I always loved the movies, always dreamed i would be in them.
I was a believer, and i actually made it, now was that a miracle?
Most of us have a turning point in our lives, a pivotal moment where you wondered, how did this happen?
Mine was 1989 i made three films, 'lean on me', 'driving miss Daisy' and 'glory'.
Did i make it happen?
Was someone up there calling the shots, or was i lucky?
To try to understand this I've arranged to meet a psychology professor who thinks we often mistake random chance for miracles.

That's a lot of tails.
Danny Oppenheimer:

Morgan Freeman:

Danny Oppenheimer:

But how rare does an event have to be before we would call it miraculous, one in a million, one in a billion?
Morgan Freeman:

Danny Oppenheimer:

Alright.
Jack of diamonds, 6 of spades, king of spades, 2 of hearts, 7 of diamonds and Ace of spades.
Is it miraculous to have gotten this sequence?
Morgan Freeman:

Danny Oppenheimer:

So it's pretty miraculous by your one in a billion standard.
Morgan Freeman:

Danny Oppenheimer:

What if it was the first six digits of your social security number, what if it were the last six digits of your social security number?
The first six digits of your phone number?
Sometimes it's not actually miraculous, sometimes it's just probability playing its tricks on you.
Morgan Freeman:

Danny Oppenheimer:

The fact that probability predicts certain things doesn't mean that there can't be divine intervention.
But miraculous things that are so unlikely that you think it can't happen by chance alone, they do happen, and they have to happen.
It would be odd if the didn't, because with six billion people in the world there are so many opportunities for something really unusual to happen, we would expect it to happen to some of them.
Morgan Freeman:

It's human nature to make a symphony out of the cacophony of events going on around us, doesn't mean that divine Providence doesn't exist.
In fact as i learned when i was in Rome, in the past chance and god co-existed.
The ancient romans had a different take on miracles.
Before they became christians romans had many gods.
They believed the gods controlled their fate and everything that happened was decided by them.
Archaeologist Valerie Higgins tells me the gods even determined the outcome of sporting events.
Valerie Higgins:

Morgan Freeman:

Valerie Higgins:

At least a quarter of a million people could fit in here.
Morgan Freeman:

Valerie Higgins:

Morgan Freeman:

Valerie Higgins:

Morgan Freeman:

How did gambling fit with the idea that your fate was already set no matter what you did, you were going to wind up the way you were gonna wind up.
Valerie Higgins:

They certainly did everything they could to get the gods behind their riders.
Morgan Freeman:

Valerie Higgins:

Morgan Freeman:

How did they go about figuring out what the gods wanted?
Valerie Higgins:

Morgan Freeman:

Valerie takes me to see the remains of the temple that dates back to the third century.
A place where romans may have tried to twist the will of the gods.
This is spectacular.
Valerie Higgins:

Morgan Freeman:

Valerie Higgins:

He's the god, he's killing the bull.
Morgan Freeman:

Valerie Higgins:

We know they did a lot of feasting.
Morgan Freeman:

Valerie Higgins:

Morgan Freeman:

Valerie Higgins:

Certainly we know there was a lot of cheating that went on in the circus Maximus.
Morgan Freeman:

Valerie Higgins:

The fact that you were allowing the gods to decide your fate, didn't mean that you couldn't help them along.
If you could.
Morgan Freeman:

Valerie Higgins:

The romans don't have faith, they just follow the rituals.
Morgan Freeman:

Valerie Higgins:

That h makes a big difference.
Morgan Freeman:

Every single event from winning a chariot race to rolling of the dice could be the result of divine intervention, a minor miracle.
I'm just trying to work out how a couple of millennia of catholicism might have changed the way the romans think.
Do they still think god will intercede?
And reward their fate with a royal flush perhaps?
The idea that nothing in our lives happens by chance did not die with the culture of ancient Rome.
It remained alive and well in the Chinese philosophy and religion daoism.
Daoism dates back nearly two millennia.
Gods are not the focus of daoism, the focus is the dao.
The ultimate creative energy of the universe to which we are all connected.
This interconnectedness means our fates are all set at birth.
So do daoist's believe miracles are possible?
To find out I'm heading to the heart of the
Chinese community in Los Angeles to meet a fourth generation daoist fate calculator named Jenny liu.
Jenny liu?
Jenny liu:

Morgan Freeman:

Jenny liu:

Morgan Freeman:

Jenny liu:

Morgan Freeman:

So did you do my life chart?
Jenny liu:

Morgan Freeman:

Jenny liu:

These stars configure a certain energy field that impact the quality and success of your life.
So in China we don't call this astrology actually, we call it fate calculation, fate calculation.
Morgan Freeman:

Jenny liu:

Morgan Freeman:

Jenny liu:

In the friendship sector the star that's there is called wun-zong.
This star represents scholars, learned people.
These are the people that you want to surround yourself with.
Morgan Freeman:

Jenny liu:

Morgan Freeman:

Jenny liu:

We see a life map, just like we say life is a journey, and you go on any journey you need to have a map.
There's gonna be dead ends, there's gonna be multiple pot holes.
If you know where they are you're still in charge of your own car, this is just a navigation system.
You can turn.
If you understand how you're connected to everything around you, that is the miracle waiting to happen.
Morgan Freeman:

Jenny liu:

Everything is made of energy, we're all connected through this energy.
Feng is wind, shui is water.
It's an energy that we cannot destroy or create, it's always there.
But we can divert it, we can harness it.
In China we say.
Morgan Freeman:

Jenny liu:

I was gonna say in Chinese they'll say birds do not fly they are flown.
Fish do swim they are.
Morgan Freeman:

Jenny liu:

Morgan Freeman:

Jenny liu:

Everything has a reason for why it occurred.
Morgan Freeman:

Jenny liu:

Morgan Freeman:

Birds don't fly, they ride the wind.
Fish don't swim, they're carried.
Everything that happens to us is a result of all the things that we are connected to.
What we call divine intervention is merely connections we weren't aware of.
Makes me wonder if we shouldn't maybe stop trying so hard to control our lives and learn to ride the wave of life.
Our lives are filled with unexpected twists and turns.
Some believe there's nothing beyond randomness.
Others say we are propelled by the will of god or the energy of the universe.
Both those beliefs could make the difference between life and death because the human mind could have a hidden power to unleash a miracle.
Morgan Freeman:

And I've come to Cairo to find out if that power could come from our own minds.
I'm visiting one of the world's oldest hospitals, a place that was famous for combining medical science with the healing power of belief.
Ahmed ragab:

Morgan Freeman:

Ahmed ragab:

Morgan Freeman:

Ahmed ragab:

When you walk into this corridor from the outside the sunny and the dirty street, and it's very noisy.
You walk in here and it's a dark, calm, shaded corridor.
Morgan Freeman:

Ahmed ragab:

Morgan Freeman:

Oh my goodness.
The construction here is the most impressive thing i think I've seen anywhere.
Ahmed ragab:

Patients would have come in and offer prayer of thanks for the sultan.
Slowly qalawun himself becomes connected to the idea of healing.
It's like in this history we're looking at the making of a healing Saint.
Morgan Freeman:

Ahmed ragab:

So at the end of the day we fall sick in part this is something that god wills, and we would only be healed through medicine but only by the will of god.
Morgan Freeman:

Ahmed ragab:

Morgan Freeman:

Ahmed ragab:

Morgan Freeman:

But can belief in divine intervention actually help medicine heal us today?
♪ [Church members singing]. ♪ tom Renfro is familiar with the cliché the miracle of modern medicine, because he's a practicing physician, but he also believes in divine miracles and that one happened to him.
Tom Renfro:

at that time was, "you are looking at a true miracle."
"A miracle of god."
Morgan Freeman:

Indiana university scholar candy Gunther brown to
Norton, Virginia to meet tom.
She's studying whether faith and prayer can actually improve medical outcomes.
Candy Gunther brown:

Tom Renfro:

Later on that fall i found more nodules under my arm, and i sought medical attention, and the biopsy under my arm showed that i had an unusual form of lymphoma called mantle cell lymphoma.
The prognoses was very poor, and they gave me months to live, and basically told me enjoy what time you have left.
And the goal is to hopefully keep me alive through Christmas.
I was a physician, i knew the objective evidence that was there.
I was in multi organ failure.
I had a disease that there was no medicine or cure for that would wipe this disease out.
Instead of despair the lord wants us to remember, i brought you all this way I'm not gonna leave you here by yourself.
Candy Gunther brown:

Tom Renfro:

The tumors continued to progress, and as they progressed the people came together more and more intense with prayer.
My pastor organized a weekend prayer to where people would come and pray perhaps even all night, and it was a remarkable time.
By now the tumors were the size of apples on my neck.
My arms stuck out because of the massive adenopathy under my arms.
My abdomen was expanded, i was dying.
The lord actually spoke to me and said,
"now is the time to go to the hospital."
Morgan Freeman:

It's not a cure.
Tom Renfro:

Before the infusion even completed there was something that changed in me physically.
The tumors they became like a nerf ball, like a sponge, and very soft, and they started disappearing in front of your eyes.
And all of this massive adenopathy just disappeared over the next 24, 48 hours.
It was gone.
Candy Gunther brown:

Tom Renfro:

No one expected the tumors to utterly start disappearing or melting.
I should have died multiple times during this illness from pulmonary embolisms, from pneumonia, from renal failure.
But i had faith.
I had people that poured their words into me to encourage me, and i believe through that that god intervened and healed me, and here we are 18 years later me talking to you.
To me that is a miracle.
It is a miracle that I'm here.
Morgan Freeman:

Tom believes the power of his faith and that of the people around him helped the chemotherapy achieve the impossible.
It strikes me that much of what we call miraculous starts right here in the mind.
We close our eyes in prayer don't we, and i think that's because the goal is to focus the mind.
To transcend the distractions of everyday life.
To set our minds to achieve what at first we might fear is impossible.
I've come to India to explore a religion that believes we all have the mental power to perform miracles.
This is the mahabodhi temple in bodh gaya.
According to Buddhist tradition 2,500 years ago a man named siddhartha gautama came to the realization that the human mind had immense untapped powers.
In doing so he founded an entirely new religion, buddhism, and tradition says he did it right here under this tree.
I want to understand what Buddhists believe happened to siddhartha as he sat under the tree.
Tibetan monk losang tenpa has promised to help me find out.
Losang:

Buddha obtained awakening.

So I've got to keep him in this palace surrounded by beautiful sense objects, flowers that never drooped, beautiful young ladies who never look old.
Morgan Freeman:

Losang:

Buddha left the palace, right?
Morgan Freeman:

Losang:

Morgan Freeman:

He saw real life.
Losang:

Morgan Freeman:

Losang:

Morgan Freeman:

Losang:

Morgan Freeman:

Yeah it's like an eye opener, it's like a wow.
Losang:

Morgan Freeman:

Losang:

He made him think so strongly, he felt I've got to leave this place and find out what is the cause of this.
Why do people suffer?
Morgan Freeman:

Until he finally came to the shade of a ficus tree, and decided that he would stay right on that spot, focusing his mind, until he discovered how to end human suffering.
After sitting motionless for an entire night, siddhartha achieved a mental transformation.
Buddhists say he became the Buddha, the enlightened one.
Losang:

Second, i know the cause, basically craving attachment.
Morgan Freeman:

But the Buddha and for generations of Buddhists after him, this freedom from attachment seems to allow a remarkable perhaps even miraculous mental and physical focus.
Losang:

Morgan Freeman:

Losang:

We haven't exercised our minds.
We're so busy with external things, buying and selling, and doing all the things.
Morgan Freeman:

Losang:

Morgan Freeman:

Walking around this temple you feel like a miracle really could happen.
The miracle of people being content with their lives.
People getting along together.
Losang:

Morgan Freeman:

Tibetan lama:

That is the source of happiness.
Whoever had that their journey's good.
Whoever not keep this in their heart, journey's not good.
Thank you, from today you are my friend.
Okay.
Morgan Freeman:

Tibetan lama:

Morgan Freeman:

I mean christianity, judaism.
Losang:

Morgan Freeman:

Losang:

Morgan Freeman:

Losang:

I mean flying in the sky is that a miracle?
Morgan Freeman:

Losang:

Morgan Freeman:

Losang:

We ask the mystics or the yogi's were is god?
They'll point here, they won't point up there.
They'll say it's in here.
So then if you're being inspired by your inner god,
Buddha, Christ, you know, Christian or whatever you want to call it, maybe then you can perform what's called a miracle.
What does this world need the most?
It needs healing, right, love, it needs reconciliation.
I think that's a miracle, and that's the miracle we need.
We don't need people levitating three inches off their butts, you know, while meditating that's stupid.
Morgan Freeman:

Losang:

Morgan Freeman:

Losang:

Morgan Freeman:

Losang:

Morgan Freeman:

It's ironic that a man who wanted us to tap into the power that we all have within ourselves, is thought of as some sort of divine being.
The point of buddhism as far as i can see, is to teach us that we're all capable of much more than we might believe we are, if we just concentrate on it, just put our minds to it.
I used to struggle to make sense of miracle stories.
How oceans could be parted.
How it was possible to walk on water.
But i think i was missing the point.
To believe in miracles is to believe there is more to life than meets the eye.
To accept there could be something that connects us, unites us.
So many souls pass through this world, and as our paths cross miraculous things can and do happen.
People get the breaks they always wanted, people inspire one another, people fall in love.
And whether these events are orchestrated by the hand of god, the power of the mind, or just a one in a million chance, i believe we should believe in miracles.
Because miracles however you define them help us to, well they give us hope.
They drive us to create reality out of possibility.
