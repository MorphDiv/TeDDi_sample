Previously on "the Americans"...
Henry has really come into his own.
He's... he's prepared, he's interested, and he's demonstrated a real aptitude for challenging material.
We think we know what happened to William.
Somehow he infected himself with the virus he was carrying.
I'm afraid he has one last job.
Hold on.
I have to talk to you.
I'm going home.
Muj?
Yeah.
What is it?
See the blood there?
Is that all blood?
Yeah.
Christ.

Yeah.

Ahh!

(Chuckles)
You want to know what I wished for?
Well, don't tell me.
So, uh, what'd you do on the day?
Oh. (Chuckles)
I have this tradition with my dad.
He takes me to the jockey club for crabcakes.
Mm.

We, uh, used to do it when I was little with my mom.
It sounds sweet.
(Chuckles)
You miss your son, don't you?
You think about him a lot?
Yeah.
What do you think about?
That someday I'll...

And I'll do it right for them.
I don't think anybody does it right.
Okay.

(Chuckles)
That's a better ambition.
(Chuckles)
♪♪
Yes, that's four seats total, and it can be two and two, across the aisle...
Okay, I will book that.

Did we ever get reimbursed for the lyndhurst cancellation?
Ooh.
I don't think so.

Okay.
We should get Henry to do the books, he's so good at math.

I still can't get over that report card.
I know.
Did you ever think that he'd be doing better than Paige?
(Chair creaks)
(Philip sighs)
It seems like she's over Matthew.
Well, that's good.
Does tuan ever say anything about any girls to you?
I just think he's lonely.
(Sighs)
Yeah.
I was supposed to go over there tomorrow, but evgheniya asked me to go shopping, and I need to do that.
I'll go over and see tuan tonight.

Maybe even stay the night.
I just think, from now on, we have to ke...

Yes?
Dr. tippens' office for you.
Thanks.
This is Philip Jennings.
Hello, Mr. Jennings.

For your appointment Thursday at 2:00 P.M.,
Dr. tippens is not available.
There's going to be a substitute, his colleague,
Dr. penderson.
He's a very dear, old friend, and he's never too busy to help someone in need.
Thank you.

Dr. penderson's office is at 4629 southeast grasslands parkway, near the intersection of 264 and tresslau.
Okay.

One of Gabriel's people.

(Indistinct conversations)
Stan.
It's not absolutely conclusive yet, but they just translated an intercept from Thailand showing travel for a group of known kgb officers coming in and out of the country at the same time gaad was murdered.
There was nothing else going on in Thailand to tie those guys to.
I know how you feel about squeezing burov, but it might take years for us to get somebody like that inside the kgb again.
I could be next on their list.
Or you.
Any of us can be a target.
He's there.

Let us use the tape against him and get him working with us against them.
Think it through.
(Door opens)
Hello?
Tuan?
Tuan?
(Clock ticking)
Breland:

Um, roast beef, lettuce, onion, mustard, on a roll.
Woman:

(Telephone rings)
Hello?
Hey, evgheniya.

Sorry to call you so late.
Are you okay?
I was just wondering if tuan was over there.
I don't think so.

Pasha:

Sorry, Dee.
Pasha does not know where tuan is.
Okay.

I'm sure he'll turn up soon.
Okay.

CIA officer #2:

Breland:

That's the problem.
The super nite diet has no stimulants and is backed by an absolute money-back guarantee.
Well, it's time to put your super nite diet to work.
Here's how to order.
Announcer:

Norfolk, Virginia, 23501.
That's 1-800-453-25...
CIA officer #1:

Steve recruited him.
So who was at the meeting?
Tulip, Daisy, and Shepherd.

(Switch clicks)
Well, tell her I'll miss it.
I can't make every goddamn party.
Woman:

(Drawer closes)
CIA officer #2:

I still need to finish.
Well, don't spend too much time on it.
(Chain clicks)
Muj?
Yeah.
What is it?
See the blood there?
Is that all blood?
Yeah.
Christ.

The doctor said it's some kind of hemorrhagic fever.
Did he say anything else?
His report is on the way.
(Insects chirping)
(Softly) Tuan never came home.
(Sighs)
I called the morozovs around 10:00.
He wasn't with pasha.
I waited until 3:00 A.M.
He could be out with those new kids, but...
What?
(Zipper opens)
I don't know.
Out in the middle of the night...
What, you think he's reporting on us?
To who?

The centre talked to them.
I know.
Not the Americans.
I can't imagine.
I went through the house.

Okay.
I mean, it would make sense that he's out with those kids if... if he's trying to work them against pasha, but... 3:00 A.M. just seems a little late.
Yeah.
It didn't feel right.
We'll check it out.
Have norm and Marilyn...
Yeah.
I, uh...
I was at Kimmy's a few days ago.
And on the tape, um...
A group of mujahideen died of a hemorrhagic fever.
So maybe it wasn't about protecting us after a nuclear attack.
Maybe they just wanted to use it in Afghanistan.
We don't know it's the same virus we gave them.
It's a hell of a coincidence if it isn't.
(Elevator bell dings) Woman:

Yes, she will... (Telephone rings)
(Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.)
Have you been busy today, father?
Never too busy to help someone in need.
(Indistinct conversation)
Gabriel gave me all this equipment before he left.
To make the reports for the next few months.
He showed me how to use it, but...
I can't use it.
It's all right.

(Elevator bell dings)
Father Victor was out again last Tuesday and Wednesday, very late.
He came back both times drunk.
I know he's been seeing the frenchman.
How much of this did Gabriel know?
He knew about it, but it's getting more serious.
His eminence the metropolitan is listening to father Victor more and more.
I've seen them meeting in private.
I know what you'll think.
That I'm looking out for myself, my position.
That I'm jealous.
I'm not.
I'm telling you what's going on so you can protect yourselves.
All right.
Thank you.
(Clears throat)
Will I see you again, then?
Only if something urgent comes up.
Um, the new person who's coming to work with you should be here in two to three months.
Hm.
Sometimes i hear things...
Exactly the things i was asked to tell you about.
I don't know if they're urgent.
I used to just tell Gabriel, and...
Well, he always said it was very important for him that we talk them through.
I'm sorry.

I understand.
I will pray for you.
(Chuckles lightly) Okay.
You should try it.
I keep hearing that.
It is a great solace.
Especially when you live this kind of life.
Linh:

Good.

He's a senior now, if you can believe it.
Wow.

Ah, thanks.

Looking at colleges?
Yeah.

You know we're not, uh...
I know.
Well...
Well, she's in charge of all that.
W-well, it's...

It's been, um, quiet since the funeral.
Mm.
Have you been...

Getting support?
Some.
You know, not one of you from the office has been by.
Or called.
That's awful.
I, uh...
I guess we're not the best at that.
Now that he was retired, i thought maybe...
Sorry.
It's okay.
How are things there?
Okay.
You know, he was a great boss.
I mean, I'm not the easiest guy to be the boss of.
(Chuckles)
(Gulps)
Did you just come to visit?
Well...
I'm sure that, over the years, he's told you some things that you couldn't repeat.
Yes.
We have a better sense now of what happened in Bangkok.
It was them.
And now I have something on someone else...
An unrelated case...
But the department wants me to use it as a way to get back at them.
The thing is, this guy, he didn't do anything.
The opposite.
I don't see putting him at risk so we can go after some other people.
Revenge isn't that important.
And I don't think it would be to frank.
He would want revenge.
(Keys rattle)
(Door closes)
Hey.
Hi, Henry.
Can I talk to you guys for a second?
S-sure.

Uh...
S-so...

We sure do.
My friends have been, too.
My new friends.

And she's going to this great high school next year called St. Edwards.
It's in New Hampshire.
Her brother's a junior there.
Her dad went and her uncle.
Her whole family.
So, is it a religious school?
No, no.
It's...

And I want to go there.
It's in...

Right, but it's a boarding school, so I would live there during school, and then I'd come home vacations.
And when would this start?
Next fall.
W... uh, what... what...
What's wrong with...

Well, like Paige's:

Well, there are private schools here.
But, w...

I mean, p-p-private schools cost a fortune.
Yeah, but at St. Edwards,
I can probably get a scholarship.
I sent in an application.
Already?
Without telling us about it?

Okay, look.
It's not like I can go and not tell you.
You have to, like, say yes.
Henry, wait.

Let's slow this all down for a second.
But it's a great opportunity, mom.
Henry, do you not want to live here?
No, no, it's not that at all.
It's just that St. Edwards is great.
Chris told me all about it, and her dad wrote a recommendation for me...
He... he wrote a recommendation?
Look, it's an important school.
Important people have gone there.
Two senators and a guy who won a nobel prize.
It's really prestigious.
The academics, the sports, the activities:
They're all right there.
You wouldn't have to drive me anywhere.
I'd just be there.
The teachers are your coaches.
You eat dinner with them.

It's serious.
The students are waiters.
It's a lot of responsibility.
Here, here's a brochure.
So...

Oh, no, no.

She's not my girlfriend.

But you've been spending a lot of time with her family?
My teacher Mr. jeffries thinks it's a great opportunity.
He says that I'm at the most important developmental stage:
Kids my age.
Don't we want to capitalize on that?

Galina?
(Knock on door) (Music stops)
Oh.
Uh...
May I come in for a moment?
I-i won't stay long.
Thank you.
Oh, I'm interrupting your dinner.
It's just a snack.
Well, it looks good.
Would you like something to drink?
Just a glass of water, please.
(Glass clinks)
(Water runs)
(Water stops)
How's your Russian coming?
Your life will get better when your Russian improves.
Do my parents know where I am?
No.
But I spoke to them, and I told them you were safe.
That you were being taken care of by people who respect you.
Why are you here?
Do you have some news for me?
No.
Did you came all this way just to...
No.

I'm...

I-I've retired.
(Sighs deeply)
I was done.
Hm.
(Sniffs)
Are you married?
No, no.

I never was.
Too difficult for my work.
I have some family.
Well, that must be nice.
Well, we're not close.
But I came to hear about you.
Tell me, do you like your teacher?
Galina?
She's nice.
She comes in every other day.
We talk.
She helps with grammar, writing...
And who takes care of everything else?
Volodya...
From your organization.
He makes sure i have what I need.
You're friends?
No.
Has volodya introduced you to people?
A few.
Men.
Nobody suitable.
Well, as soon as your language improves, we'll see to it that we find you a job at a paper or in publishing, translating.
Y-you'll meet people.
Clark thinks about you, Martha.
He wanted to send you a letter, but it's not allowed.
He's the reason i talked to your parents.
He insisted.
He wants what's best for you.
We all do.
What's best for me?
I understand everything now, Gabriel.
All of it.
You can go.
And please don't come back again.
There you go.
