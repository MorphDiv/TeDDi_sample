Everything was burnt except for that one.
No.

Did I do that?
I have to go home.
President Cha.

Who's doing this?
Park Jeong Woo.

It's the video of the spot investigation.
The man in the video is right-handed... while Park Jeong Woo is left-handed.
How did you know that?
You want to help me?
You should at least avoid the death sentence.
If it was really me, I would face the death penalty... a thousand times.
If I avoid the death penalty, what will change?

Inmate 3866 has a dangerous object in possession.
Inmate 3866!
Catch him!
Inmate 3866!
Don't come closer!
Park Jeong Woo.
I'll kill him if you come any closer.
- What is it?

- Why are you here?

I definitely engraved the name.
(Park Bong Goo)
Why did I engrave it there?
(1 week before the first trial)
(Episode 4)
And for me.
Whoever's dead, stay out.
I'll be out in three months.
Why would I choose to die?
I'll bet one Choco Pie... and this Ramen as well.
Am I making you nervous?

You little baby.
- All in.

Boss, I know you're bluffing.
Okay then.

Boss, your cards are obvious.

What have I got to lose?

This game is getting exciting.
Then I'll reveal my card first.
Whoever's below me dies.
Why would I die?
I'm not even on death row
Ta-da!
Rockfish.
You'll bring him bad luck.
Then these are all mine.
Don't be in such a hurry.
You have to see my card as well.
- It's obvious, isn't it?

Ta-da.
- I win!

- Why?

- You can't get away...

Your criminal record tells us everything.

Fraud and opening an illegal gambling parlor.
Are you kidding us?

I didn't shuffle the cards.

Mix the cards.

What do you mean start over?

- Stop it.

- I can't accept it.

Your trial's coming up soon, right?
It's mine.

Have you recovered some of your memory?
A little bit.
I heard it'll be a tough battle because there's a lot of evidence.
There are a lot of parts that seem suspicious.
I'll have to do some research until the trial.
The first trial is coming up.
I'm sure there'll be nothing for you to worry about.
Yes, Sir.
I understand.

Now, bet two each.
Let these pass for two.
- Of course.

Here.

Ta-da.
Too bad.

Hold on, Boss.
Now that I see it, there's not much to you, is there?
There you go.

I win.
- You scum.

- Darn it.

Hello, Sir.
I found it, Sir.
- That's not mine.

- Yes, Sir.

It's not mine.
- Move it.

Let go.

They're not my cigarettes.
Let go of me.
All right.

I'll go.

My trial is near!
My trial is coming up.

It's not mine.
Those cigarettes aren't mine!
Not mine.

Those cigarettes aren't mine!
Officer, those cigarettes aren't mine.
My trial is near.
Officer, officer!
My trial is soon.

Officer!
Here it is.
- This is it.

Thank you.
I know some people in the Department of Justice.
I'll see if I can get you transferred... to Seoul.
My goodness, thank you.
But why... do you go so far with him?
My brother was a troublemaker, but if it wasn't for Prosecutor Park,
- he wouldn't be gone like this.

- Have a drink.

I heard he lost his memory a few times before.
I wish he would... receive this trial without knowing... why he is there.
Right.
It's because I want to pay him back... for how my brother suffered.
He lost his memory twice already.
If we're lucky, that'll happen again.
Even if it doesn't happen, he can't prepare for his trial.

- Another round?

Open the door.
Open the door!
I need to think.
My trial will be held soon.
My trial...
You can't get out.
Tae Soo?
Tae Soo.

I know.
What?
The warden and the head of security... hate you as much as I hate you.
I don't know why.
My trial will be held soon.
I have to prepare for it.
I can't stand for a trial like this.
Help me, Tae Soo.
Are you still saying... that you haven't killed them?
I don't remember.
I can't remember anything.
I'll prove myself in the court.
I still have time.
I need to find out who did this.
Yes.
If I did it...
If I did it,
I will pay for my sins.
To do that,
I need those documents.
Help me, Tae Soo.
You could only get out the last time after you lost your memory.
You probably can't get out... before you lose your memory again.
Tae Soo.
Tae Soo!
Tae Soo...
Not yet?
I told you.

It's about time he lost his memory again.
We still have another day.

What an imprudent young man.
If he's so competent, he can try doing it.
It's not like I can control him.

Come in.
- What about his memory?

What do we have to do?
It's not like I can cut open his brain.
- Can't we do anything?

It's not like we can do anything.
- Let's wait it out.

He should just ask me to kill him.
It's such an odd request.
(Mother)
Please.
You probably can't get out... before you lose your memory again.
What if...
I don't... recognize them?
(Park Bong Goo)
(Park Bong Goo)
(Innocent Defedant)
Hey, you in the last cell.
There should be letters engraved on the floor.
Can you tell me what it says?
You're right.

Did you find it?

Yes, I did.

That's right.

Let me see.
There are more.
Please.

The problem is...
I can't read.
What do you mean?

It... just happened,
Prosecutor Park Jeong Woo.
Who are you?
I'm heartbroken.
Both of us nearly died thanks to you.
What?
What do you want to do now?
We both may die here.
Shin Cheol Sik.
You are under arrest for... soliciting the murder of Kim Yong Joo.
Shin Cheol Sik?
Shin Cheol Sik?
You remember me.
I told you I didn't do it.
Okay.
Please, I'm begging you.
Please tell me what it says.
Shin Cheol Sik.
Please.
I'm begging you.
Open it.
Get out.
Yes, Officer.
Search the cell.
There's nothing.
What is going on?
Did you see anything?
What?
I just ate my meal... and was going to take a nap.
You jerk.
Tell me if you saw anything.
I will send you to a solitary cell.
Did I see anything?
I saw something.
What?
I saw three blowflies in there.
You idiot.
Put him in.
Why did you do that?
I guess I'm the only one... who knows about it now,
Prosecutor Park Jeong Woo.
I wonder if these dishes will suit your taste.
They are nice.
Today is your birthday.

Why don't you go out with her and take her shopping?
Grandma, I want to go, too.
Do you want to go as well?
Yes.
Good boy.

He started taking soccer classes.
That's good.

You little rascal.

Why isn't Min Ho coming, by the way?
Why is he taking such a long trip?
Do you keep up with him, Seon Ho?
Of course.
He doesn't even call me.
I feel sorry for him.
Take good care of him when he comes back, so he'd settle himself down.
I will.

- Seon Ho, I need to talk to you.

He won a gold medal in the World Championships.
What do you mean?
I'm talking about Lee Chan Young.

You are the head of the association.

I know that.

Arrange a meeting sometime to celebrate his victory.
I will arrange a supporters' night.
Supporters' night?
- That sounds good.

Why don't you have a match with Lee Chan Young that night... as a special celebration?
A match?
You can do that as the head of the association.
Father, that's...
Are you afraid?
No.
I can do it.
- I will look forward to it.

(Warden)
Hello?
President Cha, Inmate 3866 is not giving up an appeal.
I see.
Why is everyone doing this to me?
What's the matter?
What happened to Park Jeong Woo?
About what?
That he made a fuss with a pen you carried with you?
Or that he changed his mind to give up an appeal?
Jeong Woo... is confused enough with his own problems... even if it weren't for you.
I'm trying to help him.
Help him?
What can you do for him?
Jeong Woo will be better than you at his trial.
He will argue the case better than you.
How will you help him?
He lost his memory.
Can you make him regain his memory?
I can't make him regain his memory, but I can help him... more than you.
Let me ask you a question.
No, two questions.
Did you take Park Jeong Woo who lost his memory to court... as the prosecutor or as his friend?
Second, if Park Jeong Woo loses his memory again, will you take him to court again without postponing the trial?
I will answer the questions at once.
What if...
Jeong Woo didn't lose his memory?
- What?

Open the door.
Open it.
Jun Hyuk, what am I doing here?
Open the door.
- Jeong Woo.

Why are you doing this to me?
Jun Hyuk!
One month later, I heard that he lost his memory again.
Ha Yeon.

Ha Yeon.

Is anyone there?
Jun Hyuk.
Jun Hyuk.

On the day of his first trial, he lost his memory for the third time.
It happened again on December 31.
And the day before he lost his memory again, he'd told me something.
I did it.
The defendant just admitted to it.
Prosecutor, please be generous.
You two are friends, after all.
The death penalty is just too harsh.
I will prepare the documents again.
Maybe... it won't be the last time.
He might lose his memory over and over again.
He lost his memories on important days.
In a situation like this, how far should I believe him?
Does it answer your questions?
But... what would Park Jeong Woo gain from all that?
He ended up becoming a death-row convict.
Only Jeong Woo would know the answer.
- Public Defender Seo.

If you wanted to win, you shouldn't have trusted your defendant.
Do you know why you always lose?
It's because you only take the cases in which you will lose.
Is it true... he lost his memories?
I can't remember.
I don't remember anything.
Ha Yeon's birthday is still vivid, but I don't remember anything else.
Jeong Woo.
Is it true you can't remember anything?
All right, let's celebrate Park Jeong Woo and Kang Jun Hyuk... being commissioned as prosecutors!
- Thank you.

Bottoms up.

- Alcohol tastes awesome today.

- "Awesome." Goodness.

Who are you, heavy drinker?
Who will ever marry her?
Why?
I mean, aren't I...
- an okay woman?

Why aren't you answering?
I mean, you are okay, but...
Yes, you are okay, but...
You aren't bad.
- You're a bit odd.

What?

Hey, you must be quick-witted.
These two prosecutors are not satisfied with someone like you.
- No, Mother.

I mean, Ji Soo is... a little okay, I guess.

A little?
- What about you, Prosecutor Kang?

- a little.

That's bigger than me.
- A little.

Fine.
Let's decide it today.
Whoever finishes this glass... will become my mother's son-in-law.
Who will ever marry her?
My goodness.

Okay.
Are you okay?
Jeong Woo?
Yes, Mother-in-law.
I'm fine.

I'm fine.
Mother-in-law?
My goodness.

My gosh.

It's great.
Would that be too hard?
Would that be too hard or what?
Prosecutor Park Jeong Woo.
My gosh.

You went through all that trouble to come in here, didn't you?
How can I do that?
Exactly.

It's not like I want to be taken out of prison.
I just want to be taken out of this cell.
Staying in this cell makes my mind go blank.
See?
I can't even remember... what was written on the floor.
I'm such an idiot.
You and I are in the same shoes, you idiot!
We are not in the same shoes.
I told you, it wasn't me!
I am framed.

I am in this trouble because of you.
Can't you let me out of this room?
Do what you want.
Think it through, Prosecutor Park.
Who's the desperate one here?
That must've hurt.
Park Jeong Woo.
Why is he making another appeal?
He must be insane.
What?
I'm kidding.
Most of these violent crimes end up in the Supreme Court.
Don't worry about it, President Cha.
Yes, okay.
(Medical diagnosis)
Who are you?
Stop right there!
What is it?
Oh, Chairman.
It's nothing.
How is the supporters' night coming?
I'll make sure it's perfect.
Yes.
There are...
- no security cameras on your floor.

- You've asked us to turn them off.

I did.
Should we turn them back on?
No, leave them as it is.
(Medical diagnosis)
No.
It can't be Park Jeong Woo.
(An incumbent prosecutor murders his wife and daughter)
Which one of these idiots was he?
All right, let's eat.
- Okay.

Aren't you hungry?
- Can you look at this report?

I can't seem to get used to this.
That's how things are on your first appointment.
- Is that so?

Right, you should eat.
We're all in this to make a living.

- Thanks for the food.

This looks good.
(Doctor's note)
(Medical diagnosis)
(Fear of needles)
When you've reached a wall, you have to shake them even more.
If so, someone is bound to show their weakness.
Prosecutor Park.
You want to know what's written on it, don't you?
Then get me out of here.
Do whatever you can.
You killed them both.
Don't you ever forget that.
Also, make sure you recall... where Ha Yeon is.
No matter what.
Hurry and take this.
Do you expect us to survive with this?
Give me some more.
It's important to have a good breakfast.
You don't have anywhere to use your energy anyway.
Gosh.

Here you go.
Thank you.

Have you decided yet?
I'll end up staying here the rest of the week.
I guess I'll just have to, won't I?
If I get you out,
keep your word.
I see you've come up with a way.
Officer, I have a favor to ask.
What?
Can I really go out?
Oh, my.
- I'm really stepping out.

Salute.
You haven't lost it, Prosecutor.
You haven't lost your touch.
Tae Soo.
Is it true?
You remember... where Ha Yeon is?
Yes.

If you're lying again,
I don't know what I'll do to you.
(Yoon Tae Soo)
Yoon Tae Soo.
I'm... truly sorry.
Take him away.
You idiot!

You don't get to decide who goes in and out.
What were you thinking?

Was it because he's your brother-in-law?
- He's no longer my brother-in-law.

I'm sorry, Sir.
Sir, I'll make sure he learns his lesson.
Hurry.

I'll teach you a lesson.

There's something suspicious about those two.
Drink this... since there's no tofu.
Stop going to the punishment cell.
You're supposed to drink that all at once.
Boss, you sure do care for Inmate 3866.
It's so annoying.
It's my dream to see my son become a prosecutor.
So what if he's a prosecutor?
He's sitting here because he murdered his wife and child.
Why?

Don't kill me.
Gosh.

He may talk like that, but before you lost your memory, he washed your back and gave you medicine when you were sick.
That's old news, Boss.
He's just shy and acting awkward... because you keep losing your memory.
Don't mind him.
That's right.
- Don't you agree, Seong Kyu?

They're all warm at heart if you get to know them.

Seong Kyu.
He might actually believe you.
Oh, my.

- Oh, my.

You have a long record for someone who wants a prosecutor as a son.
Do you think that will actually help him?
What?

Inmate 3866.
If I have four criminal records, my son can't become a prosecutor?
Not only that, but I'm sure he's taken after your brain.
Do you think it'll actually be possible?
What?

Do you know how well my son does in school?
- What are you doing?

Do you really want to die?
You wait and see whether my son ends up as a prosecutor or not.
My son is really good at English.
If he doesn't become one, you'll have to eat your hat.
My hat?

Do you know how to say that in English?
If you're lying again,
I don't know what I'll do to you.
Really?
By the way, you looked good in the picture.
You saw it?
- What are you guys talking about?

You should come out more often.
She's getting a divorce.
I'm sorry.
I'm all right.

It's my parents I'm worried about.
Honestly, who here married for love?
It was all between the households.
At least for you, you don't regret anything, do you?
- What?

You dated the younger brother and married the older brother.
Who would have ever thought?
She had no choice in order to save her father's company.
Yeon Hee made the right choice.
To think if she married the younger brother, she would've...
Yeon Hee's partly responsible.
If he married Yeon Hee, he wouldn't have ended up like that.
What are you two doing?

Seeing her reminded me of it.

Who else here could make such a decision between two brothers?
What's wrong?

Do you... really know what kind of decision...
I made?
- Yeon Hee.

I should get going.

Yeon Hee.
Yeon Hee.
Eun Soo.
You should say hello to your uncle.
Hello, Uncle.
This is nice.
The wind is blowing
- What?

Oh, right.
I made a promise.
What does it say?
"Doorbell".
- Doorbell?

Are you sure?
If you don't believe it, go check it yourself.
Oh no, you can't.

Trust me.
I have a few more.

This is not funny.
Gosh.
Anything else?
Was there anything else?
It wouldn't be fun if I told you everything at once.
I will reveal one at a time.

I will tell you if I need anything.
Gosh, I'm thirsty.
Doorbell?
Doorbell.
What does it mean?
Doorbell.
Doorbell.
Min Ho, are you all right?
- How is he?

He will get used to it.
I'm sorry, Min Ho.
- It's not a big deal.

Seon Ho, you will be leading Chamyung.
Don't show your tears for such a trifle.
That's pathetic.
Min Ho, what he just said...
Min Ho.
I'm all right.
Seon Ho, whom you liked, is gone now
Because...
I killed him.
"Doorbell".
Doorbell?
(Eun Hye's Beauty Salon)
Can you continue working as a public defender?
What?
You tried to receive a form of appointment.

- Let me finish eating.

- Did you even see his face?

He lets me see him.
What is the good of meeting him?

Why did he see you?

Forget it and join a law firm.

What did you just say?
- Join a law firm.

How can I remember everything I said?
- I should go.

Eun Hye, you should eat something.
(Defendant Park Jeong Woo)
Inmate 3866.
You have a visitor.
(Visitor No. 3168)
(Visitor No. 2574)
Will he come to see me?
(Visitor No. 3866)
When will you stop coming to see me?
I have a question to ask you.
- Which hand did you use?

Which hand did you use to stab your wife?
- Are you crazy?

Try to recall it.
Yoon Ji Soo was stabbed by a knife held in a left hand.
Did you stab her?
Did you really stab her?
- I can't recall anything.

You saw the case file, crime scene photos, and everything.
That's right.
I stabbed her.
The case file and crime scene photos say that I stabbed her.
There's no single proof that I didn't do that.
What about it?
It's true that you lost your memory.
I thought it may not be true that you lost your memory.
Is that why you are here?
Now that you know it's true, you don't have to come anymore.
I said I had a question to ask you.
Answer me.
Why did you come to see me... whenever I requested an interview?
You don't want me to take over your case.
But why did you come to see me every time I requested... an interview, Park Jeong Woo?
Isn't it that you had a little expectation?
You hoped I'd bring something you didn't know about.
And you are here again.
- Why are you here?

You know what kind of attorney I am.
I'm not a logical person, but you know that no one can help you but me now.
That's why you came to see me, clutching at any straw, right?
Stop it!
I heard you are not giving up an appeal.
You are going to stand trial... when you can't remember anything.
If you are going to stand trial, you will need someone to help you out.
I will... be that person.
I will answer myself on your behalf.
"Help me,"
"Public Defender Seo Eun Hye."
What can I do for you?
What?
You asked me to help you.
I'm Public Defender Seo Eun Hye.
Did you just smile?
Right?
Maybe I was mistaken.
Let's go for it.
I'm waiting.
My arm is starting to ache.
Come on.
What do you want me to do now?
You said you would try to help me.
I did.
Please do so.
I will see you again next week.
Just go to sleep, Bong Goo.
You have an early morning tomorrow.
Right.

I need to follow the rule.
- What?

Six'o clock.

Someone came to my house.
That night... someone came to my house.
Prosecutor.

Park Jeong Woo wishes to meet you.
How will you handle it?
Do you plan on going?
No.

- Go through proper channels.

(Emergency Transfer)
- Remove his handcuffs.

I'm fine.
- Remove them.

- Jun Hyuk.

- Jun Hyuk.

Detective.
I wanted... to have a drink with you.
Who knows when we'll have the chance?
We often drank together.
Let's have only one drink.
Jun Hyuk.
I've remembered something.
You have?
Someone came to my house that night.
What?
On the night of Ha Yeon's birthday, someone came to my house.
I'm certain.
What do you mean someone came to your house?
That wasn't in the investigation record.
Someone definitely came to my house.
I heard the bell half asleep.
Okay.

Thank you, Jun Hyuk.
Should we investigate again who was at his house that night?
No.

Okay.
(Homicide Prosecutor Kang Jun Hyuk)
Someone came to my house that night.
On the night of Ha Yeon's birthday, someone came to my house.
(Emergency Transfer)
Go in.
Who is it at this hour?
It's...
(Innocent Defendant)
Gosh, I'm dying for a cigarette.
How can I get it here?
You remember, right?

I heard you can get it.
I get to beat a prosecutor up.

Prosecutor!
It was you.
Detective.

I am Cha Seon Ho now.
You're pathetic.
What happens if I forgive him now?
Will it bring Ji Soo and Ha Yeon back?
He lied to me again.
Scumbag!
Who was it?
