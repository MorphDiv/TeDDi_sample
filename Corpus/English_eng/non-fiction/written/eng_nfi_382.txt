Adult Adam:

If there was something awesome to do,
I was gonna tackle it with Pops, and that week, that awesome thing would be the most hyped movie our time... "Batman."
- Pops...

I have the biggest news in your 80-some years of life.
A Batman movie's coming out, and it's going to be awesome!
Batm'n?

Me and your dad love the old Adam West TV show.
- Didn't we, Murray?

Commissioner Gordon, that the Joker, Riddler, and the Catwoman have escaped.
What is that?

I think that's Adam West as Batm'n.
Your inability to identify this spot-on impression is criminal.
Come on.

Actually, the new movie stars Michael Keaton.
- The guy who plays Beetle-Buzz?

Beetle-Jazz can't be Batm'n.
There is only one Caped Crusader,
- and that is me.

Why is he doing that weird voice?
'Cause we're going to see "Batman."
I've been waiting to see that for months!
I'm gonna grab my coat and pound a couple of Jolts... want to make sure I'm really wired when I yell things back at the screen.
It appears the Batcave is all mine to watch the Bat-Television in my Bat-Underpants.
- Stop it!

- To the Batmobile!

Ahh!
Oh, man.

Great movie, great seats, great snacks.
Doesn't get any better than this.
Is that seat taken?
Is that seat taken?
[Groans] Okay.
Oh, no, it's Barry!
Is that seat taken?
We invited Barry and forgot all about him.
- Is that seat taken?

- Is that seat taken?

Yo!

Come on.

- Is that seat taken?

I-I mean, everything is so perfect right now.
That seat taken?

It's just one little "sorry." He'll understand.
What... the... hell?

You guys ditched me, now I'm walking around like a schmuck, begging strangers to move over?
We were just so excited to see the movie.
- You get it.

Where's my seat?
I think there's a couple seats in the front row.
So you expect me to sit alone in the front row, craning my neck up at the giant screen like putz-bag?
- You don't have to do it like a putz-bag.

It's only fair if we all sit in the terrible front row.
Pfft.

Two words... family.
Okay, look, the movie's about to start.
Just sit up there, and...

Fine!
But this is the worst thing that anyone has ever done to me.
♪
♪ I'm twisted up inside ♪
♪ But nonetheless, I feel the need to say ♪
♪ I don't know the future ♪
♪ But the past keeps getting clearer every day ♪
It was April 5, 1980-something.
My sister's senior year was cruising right along... until this happened.
Question...

Oh, goodie!
You got your college interview for Penn State!
Thing is, I didn't schedule it, and I'm not going.
Carnegie Mellon is the only school I care about.
Well, you always need a backup.
That's why I always bake two pies, in case Murray eats one while sleepwalking.
Mom, if I don't get into CMU, then I'm just gonna skip college to busk on the street like a true artist.
So, what am I supposed to tell people?
"Oh, there's my daughter, singing next to a hobo who's going pishy another hobo."
Penn State is amazing!
That place made your father everything he is today.
Bevy.
I lost another hot dog.
What?

I guess 'cause my, uh, gesturing hand is also my hot-dog-holding hand.
I think my point here is proven.
Murray, your daughter thinks she's too good to go to her Penn State interview.
Let's get something straight, little missy.
Graduating from Penn State is the greatest accomplishment of my life.
Too bad, Dad.

You are going to Penn State.
It is cheaper, it's more affordable, and it costs less!
That's the same thing said three different ways!
Well, if it's good enough for me, it's good enough for you.
Okay, fine.
I guess I didn't realize how important this was to you.
I promise to take my Penn State interview seriously.
By "seriously", my sister meant "intentionally tank"
her Penn State interview.
Yo, dude!

Uh, well, three. [Chuckles]
No worries.

Oh!

Oh!

There's not even a trash can there. [Chuckles]
Have a seat. [Clears throat]
I'm Kyle Schnitz, and it is very nice to meet you.
My favorite part of being an alum is getting to interview all kinds of great students.
Oh, full disclosure.
I'm not so much a, uh, great student as I am a cheater.
I'm sorry.
Aww!
That's a cute dog you got there.
Oh.

Yes, that's Ruffles.

No, I'm talking about your wife.
Boom!

Just gonna leave me hanging like that?
Lame.
Let's just forge onward, shall we?
Um, so... what programs at Penn State are you most excited to...
Oh, my!

[Muffled] Taking on this meatball sub like a champ.
- Want some, Kenny?

Uh, would you please not get sauce all over my...
Gah!

All right.
Let me, uh, cut to the chase here, Kyle.
I am one hell of a singer.
I mean, check out these pipes.

♪ Kyle Schnitz smells like farts ♪
♪ Oh, stinky, stinky farts ♪
That was right off the top of the dome.
And interview over!
The only thing more uncomfortable than Erica's interview was Barry's seat at the movie.
Wait till they get a load of me.
What's happening?
This isn't like the TV show at all.
I know!

Adult Adam:

But to Pops, his Batman was from the old TV show.
This is crazy.
You really think Adam West is the better Batman?
He's the only Batm'n.
And this new fancy movie forgot the best part!
Where were the "POWs" and "BAMs" when Batm'n socks the Joker?
I'm not so sure you need to see big cartoon words when Bat punches a dude.
We'll just watch the old show, and then you'll see what I'm talking about.
Well, no matter which Batman is better, at least we can agree we had an awesome day together.
[Clattering]
What... the... hell?

- Oh, no.

Balls is right, man!
Who exactly are you talking to right now?
You!
My neck is just jacked up from sitting in the front row.
We were bickering about Batm'n, and forgot you were up there.
But this always happens!
You two do everything without me!
Well, I know this looks bad, but we never leave you out of the fun!
- [Oven timer dings]

- Nothing.

- Don't look in the oven, Barry.

- what I think you're doing.

I'm going to the oven!

Oh, my God!
You two made Batman Shrinky Dinks... without me?
You know I live for shrinking dinks.
We know that.

There's only two shrunken dinks, man!
Not three dinks.

Yeah, 'cause it's one dink for me and one dink for you.
Don't!
Just don't.
[Oven door closes]
You're gonna pay for this.
Oh, Barry, come back.
You can have my dink.
You can have my dink, Barry!
Beverly:

Your daughter has some huge news!
Erica, tell your father all about...
Okay, I can't stand it anymore!
She said she killed in her interview... killed!
Whoo-hoo!

Yep!

Like, he's never gonna forget me.
[Laughing] Oh, my God.

That's actually, uh, good timing, 'cause Carnegie Mellon just sent you a letter, and it's kind of thin.
Oh, no!

If they said yes, they wouldn't send the thin one!
Wait.

Son of a bitch!
I got rejected!
Carnegie Mellon rejected my baby?

Well, I'm never buying another melon!
From this moment on, this family eats tree fruits only.
No more scoopable fruits.

Good news, though.

Yes!
That is good news, that I have a backup.
Murray's an alum, and you will be, too.
Penn State is happening.
Uh-huh.

Well, um...
I have to go for, uh... for a reason I can't think of right now, but it's real, so bye.
♪
Hey!
Oh, no!

It's okay!

Uh, yeah.

I'm going to my car now, and my secretary knows I'm down here.
Wait.

Or run!
- Don't make me chase you, Schnitz!

My secretary has no idea where I am.
I slipped out to go to my pottery class!
Look, I know I messed up my interview, but I have my reasons!
I only tanked it on purpose out of spite!
That's even worse than being crazy.
I'm not crazy, and this proves it!
Look at my teacher recommendations!
Just look at them!

- You are nuts, lady!

- Ow!

And I played soccer in the 10th grade!
I was also Model U.N. Treasurer!
[Tires squeal]
♪
- I think that helped.

Erica officially lost her backup school.
Meanwhile, Pops was giving me an education on the old version of "Batman."
See that?

- Th-They shoot it sideways.

Now, this is Batm'n!
Little did I know, my scorned brother was lurking in the shadows and planning a dastardly revenge plot to ensure that me and my grandfather would never forget him again.
[Laughs evilly]
What?
Adult Adam:

Barry set a treacherous trap that would destroy the dynamic duo forever.
Adam!

Oh!

You said it was an emergency.
A hang-with-my-bro emergency.
Here, have a seat.
No!
This chair.
And action... is my favorite movie genre.
Which reminds me,
I saw you watching that old Batman TV show.
Pops was right.
Adam West is better than Keaton.
Pops doesn't know the first thing about Batman.
He doesn't even say it right.

But you told Pops you love his show.
It kind of sounds like you lied to his face.
I had to.

Say it louder.
I mean, it made no sense at all.
They had a bat-calendar.
Move more into the light.
And bat shark repellant?
Why would a superhero even have that on his utility belt?

So you don't just reject Pops' Batman.
You reject Pops as a human old person?
Nah, I'm just humoring him.
All that old-timey stuff he likes, it's just not for me.
And cut.
- Why would you say that?

I always like our talks.

And with that, my brother had everything he needed to become a villain that could even rival
Jack Nicholson's Joker.
- Wait till they get a load of me.

Nothing!

Wait till they get a load of...
Nope.
Moment's passed.

It had been a day since my sister's Penn State disaster, and our parents still didn't know... until now.
Hey, folks, no need for alarm, except for the incredibly alarming phone call I just got.
It seems that Erica tanked her interview with Penn State, and then attacked the man in a parking garage.
- What?

It's not my fault!
Dad said I had to go to Penn State, and I wanted CMU, and now I have nothing, and, dear Lord, this is a disaster!
Look, you folks can relax because ol' Glascott has the solution.
- Good.

I have failed as a mother.
Are any of you familiar with the
International Correspondence School?
Do you want to make more money?

You may have seen their catchy TV commercials starring America's sweetheart, Sally Struthers.
- Don't.

In just two short years, you can get a degree in TV/VCR repair.
But I don't want to fix TVs!
Well, luckily, you have a bunch of other options... gun repair, child daycare, learning the personal computer.
We're seeing the same thing you are!
You don't have to read it out loud!
Interior decorating?

Art?

I mean, what does this school not have?
- A campus.

Okay, let's all just take a breath.
We've got one card left to play.
Murray, you're an alum.
You'll go down there and straighten this whole mess out.
Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.
What?

She made her bed, and now she's gonna have to lie in it!
Kid's got to learn.
Yeah.

Okay, I am not getting involved.
End of story!
Do not pry!
Shh!
Well, I am getting you into Penn State.
No child of mine will deal with the consequences of her actions!
Excuse me.
1-800...
As Erica's college career went up in flames, my plan to shoot a Batman movie with Pops was about to be shut down.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Adamander Goldberg in the flesh.
- Adamander?

You think Adam is short for Adamander?
It's time to pay the piper.
Do you think it's like Alexander?
Forget the name!
You got other things to worry about.
Did I ever.
At that very moment,
Pops would stumble upon a secret recording of me bashing him and all he held dear.
Nah, I'm just humoring him.
All that old-timey stuff he likes, it's just not for me.
Oh, no.

Yes... you... did.
For once, Pops is gonna be in my stupid home movie.
"RAD:

No!

I don't think you'll be stopping me.
[Dramatic music plays]
No!

Okay.

I'll just grab my toolbox and...
Damn it!

Or a utility belt with actual utilities!
Well, well, looks like you wanted to get into Penn State a little bit more than you thought, hmm, Ms. Goldberg?
She does, and we are so, so grateful that you agreed to meet with us today, and Erica is very sorry for her behavior.
I really am.
I mean, stalking you in the garage and singing a hurtful song about you smelling like poots and comparing your wife's appearance to that of a canine...
It's all... very... not good.
I might also add, she ate a sandwich on my desk.
Which reminds me, you know, I never had my lunch.
Would you mind if I rudely devoured this and wasted your time?
Okay, I deserve that.
Mm, that is very messy.
All right, well, I made my point, okay?
Well, it might interest you to know that my husband, Murray Goldberg, is an active alum of this school.
An active alum?
- Active.

Well, I'm sure we can, uh, work something out.
[Chuckles]
Just take a look.
Huh.
It appears that Mr. Goldberg is not, in fact, a graduate of Penn State.
What?

Oh, see for yourself.
He's one credit shy of graduation.
I say I'd earned a celebratory bite, hmm?
[Chuckles]
[Groans]
Oh, Schnitz!
I messed myself.
I messed myself.
College dropout?

I'm married to a college dropout?

You're a college dropout!
I dropped out to marry you, dropout!
So this is why you wouldn't help, because you've been lying for three decades?
I feel bad, and I say that from the bottom of my heart and also to end this conversation!
This is nuts.
You both lectured me my entire life on how important college is, and now I find out that neither of you even graduated?
I was one credit short!
You know, if I eat 99% of a sandwich,
I still ate a sandwich!
This isn't a sandwich!

Look, it doesn't matter what I did.
I'm still your father, and you're not skipping out on college.
I am done taking life advice from a hypocrite.
Since none of these colleges will take me,
I am just gonna focus on my music and busk on the streets like a true artist!
Why didn't you back me up on the sandwich metaphor?
Well, I hope you're happy.

We've lost her to the streets.
Busking?
As Erica walked out on her college future,
Pops had stumbled right into Barry's supervillain trap, and it was foolproof.
[Sighs] Adam said some pretty nasty words about everything you love.
Can't imagine what you must be thinking right now.
I think you secretly taped Adam in a weird attempt to turn us against each other.
How dare you, sir!
You told Adam to stand in better light.
You really need to learn how to grift someone, kiddo.
If anything, you should be angry at Adam!
He's the one who bad-mouthed you while I happened to be filming!
Yeah, where's Adam?
I was trapped with no way out.
Think, Adamander!

And then I saw it.
My sheets served as my own Bat-Signal.
Forget the Batman movie and TV show.
I'd be the greatest Dark Knight Gotham had ever seen!
I told you!

- Whoa!

That looks so much easier on TV!
Adam, are you okay?
No!
This crazy man locked me in my room so he could make a dirt-biking movie with you!
Barry, why would you do this?
The kid could have gotten real hurt.
- I just had enough.

Of you two leaving me out!
All my life, you guys have been the dynamic duo... having fun, making awesome movies.
Did it ever occur to you, just once, maybe I'd like to be included?
Barry, you're my grandson, too.

It doesn't feel like that, Pops.

Hi.
Hey.
So, me and Pops are starting our Batman movie, but we couldn't decide which Batman was better, so we're gonna have both.
Sounds fun.
A-Actually, we thought you could have some fun with us.
Really?
I mean, we got the superheroes, but no one for us to fight.
I don't know.
I-I didn't really like being the Joker.

So you're not gonna make me go home and apply to new schools?
I'd like to, but I can't, not after lying to you all these years.
So that's it?
Tell me I'm a moron!
Tell me not to give up on myself!
Tell me to apply to new schools and make something of my stupid life!
Sounds like I don't have to say anything because you already know it.
I guess you're right.
I also know that if I'm gonna start college, then you're gonna finish it.
Hey, I do high-level accounting every day.
It's one credit.

Okay, fine.
