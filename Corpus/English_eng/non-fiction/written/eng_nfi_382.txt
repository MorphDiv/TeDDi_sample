The Texas Rangers.
Is that where the baseball team gets its name from... from you guys?
Far as we're concerned.
You a Rangers fan?
Astros, maybe?
Well, I'm a fan of driving in silence all the way back to Texas, delivering you to stand trial, and getting back to see my family.
You got a family, huh?
Put it down.
Hey, put your weapon down!
Go on, do it, come on, let's go.
Hey, I said put your weapon down.
All right.
Gun!
Any reason your dog's off his leash?
Oh, I tend to let him, you know, roam free, do his own thing.
You know?
Well, in this park it's illegal not to have your animal leashed or without a collar.
Robbery/Homicide.
Sorry, boys, I'm just not that familiar with canine crimes.
Funny, I was gonna ask you guys the same thing.
Three tickets.
Dog off the leash, without a collar, no license.
Yeah, so much for fraternal brotherhood of police.
So let me ask you guys a question.
If the bad guys have a car, what do you guys do?
Call 911?
Have a wonderful day.
And be careful out there on those bicycles, okay?
It makes me wonder just why you weren't charged with an actual crime.
Because, Dr. Bansal, you gave testimony two days ago that made reference to a reckless endangerment charge.
Objection.
Dr. Bansal is clearly too cute to be guilty of anything.
You're out of order, Counselor.
This whole court is out of order!
Overruled.
Oh, so now you're attorney and judge.
Dare to dream.
So, what did the real Dr. Bansal do?
Nothing.
But he's testifying against my client, so I'm planning to invalidate his testimony by proving he lied under oath.
And that is why you should never lie to your mommy.
So, is your client guilty?
It's not as simple as that.
And I love you for that.
But let's just say the subtlety of the law is not your biggest passion.
All I'm saying is, at the end of the day, either you did or you didn't do it.
It's that simple.
What?
I think she just did it.
Shh.
You can't be seriously taking their side on this.
Have you seen the shorts these guys wear?
Hey, they're cops, just like us.
Like you, maybe.
You shouldn't have fed your ticket to the dog.
What, you would have arrested me, is that it?
You were guilty, weren't you?
At the very least, Riggs, you could have showed them a little more respect.
What's his name?
Mark Ervin.
He was transporting a sheriff department prisoner to Texas for a murder trial.
Transport got hit, Ervin got killed.
I'm guessing the prisoner didn't stick around.
Jailbreak on wheels.
Just one ranger per transport?
Ranger motto.
"One riot, one ranger."
Any shell casings?
Very professional.
Looks like somebody knew what they were doing.
Yeah... they sure did.
Silver stars and six-guns.
Geez, could you wait until happy hour before you start drinking potential evidence?
Why don't you arrest me?
He was hit by three .223-caliber copper bullets.
Two from a distance, one at close range.
Impressions from the bullets show they were all from the same Mini-14 assault rifle.
Has a pretty distinctive groove in the barrel.
We find the gun, we find the killer.
Sorry to interrupt you fellas.
I'm Samuel Petry, Texas Rangers.
And I came here to bring Mark back home.
Martin Riggs, Homicide.
This is my partner, Roger Murtaugh.
Sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
Mark was a good man.
Wish I could say dying with your boots on
We all know that.
Well, to complete the full autopsy on him shouldn't be more than a day or two.
Shall we?
So... so what do you fellers know so far?
One shooter, two cars, ambush style, that's it.
How about on the Texas side of things?
What do y'all know?
The prisoner, Wade Davies, has money.
Big construction guy from Laredo.
Got indicted for murder two years ago and fled Texas for L.A.
But what was your excuse?
I'd say from the funny way you talk,
It's good to know a fellow Texan's on the case.
And one of Inglewood's finest.
Well, ain't that a comfort.
In light of the circumstances,
I won't take offense to that.
Well, in light of the circumstances, maybe you should.
What the hell does that mean?
You said it yourself, Rog.
Professional hit.
Looks like an inside job.
"Inside job" meaning what?
Look, they knew exactly where to hit this truck.
You got an isolated road, out in the middle of nowhere.
Whoever did this, they knew the transport route.
L.A. Sheriff's Department?
Or the Texas Rangers.
It could have come from that side also.
Well, I'm glad to hear that you're inclined to question the integrity of any law enforcement body, regardless of geography.
I said that it could have.
Look, come on, Rog, we're far away from Texas, all right?
This would be a home game for the sheriff's department.
The Sheriff's angle does make some sense.
Davies was in county lockup for three days, enough time to broker
LAPD accusing the L.A. Sheriff's Department
And even before I say this, I can hear my future self laughing at my current self... be delicate about it.
Do me a favor.
Tell your future self to call me.
I'm worried about you.
You all right?
This place hasn't changed a bit.
Go figure.
I knew I'd see you again.
I'm on the edge of my seat.
Became a cop.
Good Lord, I know the LAPD has low standards, but this is ridiculous.
We need to know who signed a prisoner named Wade Davies to Texas Rangers two days ago.
You want to talk with Leila Jones, but she's not here.
You know where we can find her?
Let me guess.
You're a bowler.
That's one way to put it.
Bowling enthusiast?
Perfect-game roller.
Notice the plaque with my name and picture on it.
That's attractive.
Why would they...?
No, you look good with a mustache, Rog.
I think we found our Leila.
Leila Jones, Detective Murtaugh and Riggs.
And we understand that you had access to the transport route.
Who else had eyes on that?
I'm not exactly sure.
Look, I have to go, sorry.
Is this not a good place for you to talk?
There really isn't any good place.
We're investigating the murder of a police officer.
You know that, right?
Look, what happened was awful, but do you know what happens when you talk to the LAPD about your own?
You get transferred to night court or worse.
Worse than night court?
Rumor is, someone in the department's dog got shot.
Golden retriever.
All because they talked when they shouldn't have.
This rumor have a name?
'Cause I would love to know who shot that dog.
Look, we're just trying to help here, Leila.
We can't do that without a name.
Jeffrey Veld, same guy who approved the rangers' transport route.
Look, Sheriff's is a good group, but there's always one bad apple.
Everything all right here?
Oh, it's wonderful.
We just can't get enough of that rented-shoe smell.
Smells like foot and ass.
Oh, it's so nice.
Roger Murtaugh, in the flesh.
Oh, I recognize you from your picture on the wall.
Dude, you got to tell me, man, how'd you get them to put that up there?
I bowled a 300.
That's how.
Right, yeah.
The perfect game during which the electric score keeper just so happened to go out in the middle.
Are you suggesting that I didn't bowl a perfect game?
Just admit it, Murtaugh.
Your score is bogus.
And now I think he's questioning my integrity.
And here's the thing with that, you can question my integrity all day long, but this man is just full of integrity.
Mm, I'm questioning his integrity and your skill.
Deputy, could I show you a little bit of skill?
All right, oh, hold on, hold on.
So, just so that I'm clear, are we about to get into a fight in this bowling alley?
I mean, it's awesome if we are.
Detective Roger Murtaugh?
Hey, Luke Barton.
It's nice to meet you and thank you, both of you, for coming down to our annual fund-raiser.
Always nice to feel supported by our friends in the LAPD.
That is why you're here, isn't it?
We're investigating the murder of a Texas Ranger.
You boys heard about that, right, out in the desert?
Yeah, it's horrible what happened.
Well... if you guys need anything, just let me know.
You have the sheriff department's full support on this.
Mm, appreciate that.
Remember, Murtaugh, we're all cops here.
We're rooting for you on this case, so try not to take the outcome like you did your perfect game.
All right.
I'm-a give you three seconds to take that back and apologize.
Okay, here's the thing, if we're gonna get into a fight with police officers in a bowling alley two then there's one thing you've got to know.
Hit first.
Well, I am glad to hear that you are doing well over there, Avery.
Today captain, tomorrow who knows, right?
So far so good, and likewise.
I'm glad things are good for you at Sheriff's.
Mm, yes, they are.
12 years running now.
You know, what happened out there in the desert with that ranger... real tragedy.
It was.
Some of your detectives have been sniffing around my department.
I heard they had a run-in with some of my boys... off duty, no less.
Just doing our jobs... looking into every avenue of investigation.
I'm gonna be real clear here, Avery.
If there's a problem in my house, I will handle it myself.
Of course I would extend the same courtesy to you if the roles were reversed, you know that.
Right?
So, please, for both our sakes... tighten the leash on your boys, all right?
I will, I will talk to them, sure...
Thank you.
...but I have a dead Texas Ranger on my board and I can't tell them where not to look.
Yeah, I understand.
You know, cops... good cops... you know, they make mistakes... and those mistakes don't ever really go away.
They have consequences... and I'd really hate for this investigation to drudge up anything that you wouldn't want to surface.
Best to let the past stay... locked up.
Don't you think?
Get your men under control.
For what it's worth, the brawl was my fault and Riggs was just backing me up.
No, I threw the first punch.
I mean, I've got a reputation to uphold.
They were questioning my integrity
I mean, to be fair, and possibly murderers,
Did you guys find anything specific that links the sheriff department to the ranger's murder?
Yeah, the, uh, transfer clerk at the prison just gave us a name.
Deputy Jeffrey Veld.
Apparently he approved the transfer route the night before the murder.
And she said that
Veld recently shot a co-worker's dog.
The way she put it, for talking when they shouldn't have.
Talking about what?
We don't know.
If by "on"
you mean moronic.
If by "moronic" you mean a hell of a lot of fun, then yeah.
So, that's all we have on them right now is this... this dog thing?
Yeah, Scorsese's doing an autopsy now.
Yeah, hey,
Chief, I know, it's very disturbing, the whole dog thing.
No, it's a legitimate lead.
I want you to keep pressing, but, guys, listen to me.
We have to be...
Delicate.
...delicate and persistent.
Nobody gets a free pass on this.
Pays to be a first-time offender.
So, we have anything on Veld yet?
Sheriff's Deputy Veld... um, Internal Affairs investigated him twice for excessive force.
Not surprising, considering he put a dog in the grave.
Yeah, about that.
You okay?
You don't look so good.
Maybe that's because I just cut open the remains of a golden retriever named Thunder.
Scorsese, you do it to humans all day long.
Yeah, but humans are my comfort zone.
Dogs... not so much.
Anyway, the bullet that felled Thunder was the same caliber that killed the ranger, fired by the same Mini-14 assault rifle.
Standard issue at Sheriff's until... two years ago.
Time to get Thunder some justice.
Trish.
Of course.
You didn't sound so good.
Well, here we are in the middle of a work day, eight blocks from your office.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you think you need a lawyer.
I think I do... one I can trust.
Well, you got her... but I have to ask, does this have anything to do with Roger?
Because... if it does, you know I can't represent you.
It doesn't... not directly, at least, but it does concern something that I did back when we were partners.
Something that he does not know about.
Okay.
I'm listening.
All right.
Veld... has a prison guard fetish... which is a step up from being a dog killer... or he's got Davies holed up in there.
How you want to do this?
Meet you in the middle.
LAPD!
Ooh.
Did you really just do that?
Did you bowl a perfect game?
I'm saying in both cases, the answer is yes.
It's Davies.
Go, go, go!
Hey!
Drop the weapon!
I'd advise you to do the same, Detective.
What are you doing here?
Pursuing a suspect in the ranger murder.
You just executed Davies.
Nope, I shot a man in self-defense.
He pulled a gun on me.
The hell he did.
Look again, Detective.
It was him or me, and I got to tell you, in those situations, it never ends up being me.
Always a first.
All right, why don't we all just lower our weapons so no one else has to get shot?
Detective Murtaugh, the bowler and now the voice of reason.
Hey, Rog, sorry to further lower your opinion of the sheriff's department, but I'm pretty sure that Deputy Barton here's who killed our ranger, sprung Davies, and now he just shot him in this alleyway before we had a chance to chat with him.
You know what they say,
We can't forget about Veld.
I mean, it was his house, after all.
Aah!
All right, now we're back down to one.
You two mind lowering your weapons?
I just saved your life, Detective.
You drinking Scotch?
Yes, I am.
Can I have some?
Help yourself.
Wait, is this a trick?
Like some kind of test?
Not for you, but maybe for me.
All right, I'm confused, but you know what fixes that?
Scotch.
The past always catches up with us, doesn't it?
Past, present and future is a disaster, no matter how you slice it.
My second year on the job there was this guy, Peter Scarelli, raped and killed a ten-year-old girl.
We had DNA evidence, but then, right before trial, the DNA sample got compromised in the lab, so it was inadmissible.
He was gonna walk.
I knew this guy at the sheriff's department,
David Reed... runs things over there now... anyway,
David got me access to Scarelli's jail cell when he was in the yard.
Didn't take long to find what I was looking for.
What was that?
A strand of Scarelli's hair that found its way to the victim's sweater.
Second time around, the DNA sample was not compromised.
And Scarelli went away for life.
I framed a man for murder, Riggs.
Come on.
The guy was guilty, right?
Justice served.
So, what?
This Reed cat's putting the screws to you?
Yeah.
Says he'll ruin me if I don't back you guys off.
Murtaugh know about this?
He was my partner at the time.
Well you got to tell him.
Hey.
You're a good cop.
Don't forget that.
Go get him, Riggs.
Do it the right way.
Hey, how'd it go in there, buddy?
Did you tell them all how heroic I am, saving you and your partner's life?
Yeah, that's exactly what I told them.
It didn't cross my mind to tell them that I think Davies paid you to break him out, and then you killed him when you thought we were too close.
Do I look worried?
You look guilty.
Well, in that case, I might need to get myself a good lawyer, huh?
Hey, you think you can get me a sit-down with your wife?
I heard she's very expensive by the hour, but worth it.
What's so funny?
I can't help but thinking about how a former sheriff's deputy is gonna fare in prison.
What kind of bonds you're gonna have with your fellow inmates.
You'll let me know.
Technically, what he said wasn't a threat.
Wait, are you his attorney?
I don't care how you parse it, he invoked your name and that's not okay.
You're fearless, I get it.
I'm not worried, Roger.
Okay?
Get the door, honey.
Hi, Roger.
He usually spoils my evenings.
We need to talk.
Let's go to my office.
Roger and I need to talk.
As your lawyer,
I would strongly advise you against that.
As your lawyer?
You hired my wife?
Remember Peter Scarelli?
You framed a guy for murder.
She was ten years old, Roger.
He had to go away.
I don't disagree.
But by framing him?
I would have found another way to get him, legally!
How many others were there?
How many times did you break the law to enforce it?
He was the only one.
Oh, he was the only one?
How noble.
And you're only telling me this now, why?
Because you just got blackmailed?
I'm gonna resign, Roger.
Damn.
That actually is noble.
And if you think this is the time when I'm gonna say,
"Hey, don't do it, man, it's not worth it,"
you're wrong.
I'm not asking for that.
And I'm not asking you to forgive me.
And I appreciate that.
I can't.
Detective Riggs.
Any reason you're waiting outside my house?
Well, there was a string of burglaries in the area, and I just wanted to make sure that, you know, you and your family were safe.
Aren't you the perfect gentleman?
Well, just returning the favor, really.
Boy, you LAPD guys are so sensitive.
Well, thing is... the Murtaughs are my team.
Like your foster family?
'Cause you don't have one of your own?
Isn't that right?
Now you're just trying to charm me.
Look at you, camped outside of my house, doing this, trying to scare me a little.
You know, if I think about it,
I'd say that you and I, we're not that different.
Well, you know, there is one thing that's different.
I ain't ever killed a cop.
Right?
There's a difference.
Well... not yet, anyway.
You really thought it was a good idea to represent him... my former partner, current captain.
Good morning, honey.
And yes, I did.
He's your friend, too, and he needs my help.
What he needs is a different lawyer.
And considering his crime, the shadier, the better.
So you never had to bend the rules?
Bend the rules, yeah.
Scarelli?
Scarelli was a ruthless killer.
Avery saved by doing what he did.
By cheating the system.
Oh, come on, Roger.
We both know the system is far from perfect.
Now, you are hurting because it's Avery.
It's principle.
What did you say the other morning?
Huh? "At the end of the day, either you did it, or you didn't do it."
Scarelli did it.
And he's not even in prison anymore.
I checked.
Out on compassionate leave.
End-stage liver disease.
At the end of the day, Trish,
Avery did it, too.
We have enough cops out there not playing by the rules.
I'd like to report a break-in over on 28 Lynwood Place.
Yeah, hope you're here in a hurry.
These came from Barton's house?
That's the wrong question to be asking right now, Rog.
are those the rounds that killed our ranger?
Okay, how about I return them after we make the arrest?
What, you don't think I want this guy, too?
He killed one of our own.
But it means nothing unless we can prove that Barton was in possession of the murder weapon.
Now we can.
I checked the bar code.
That box of ammo was purchased at the Temecula Gun Show about two months ago, along with four Mini-14 assault rifles.
Guess who made the purchase.
Luke Barton.
No.
The L.A. Sheriff's Boy's Home.
Assault weapons for a charity?
Right, except for it wasn't an official department charity, it was a personal charity, founded by your boy.
Luke Barton.
Let me guess, a large contribution was made to this charity right before Wade Davies' release?
More proof that Davies hired Barton to bust him out of custody.
All right, let's tell Avery.
Okay, now we get a warrant.
We make a legitimate arrest.
We do this by the book.
You're such a stickler.
Hey, Cap?
Anyone seen the captain?
He hasn't been here all day.
All day?
Mm-mm-mm.
You think Barton's got something to do with this?
Straight to voice mail.
Bailey, need you to get a location on the captain
ASAP.
I'm on it, just give me a few minutes.
Looks like you started without me.
Yeah, well.
Why not, right?
You know, it seems my request to back off fell on deaf ears.
I tried to steer my guy away.
But your man, Barton, didn't exactly cover his tracks very well.
You were really okay with him killing the ranger?
No.
But it's not like he asked.
You know, he's got this thing for frontier justice.
But Veld takes the fall for this and no one is the wiser.
He killed a cop.
How can you live with that?
Look, at this point, Barton is off the reservation.
We both have guys under our command like that now, don't we?
Guys who like to color outside the line, but who can be very useful.
You can try to put a short leash on them, but at the end of the day you can't always control what happens.
It makes me sick.
Scotch helps.
And so should the knowledge that your career can continue.
You know, not a day goes by that I don't regret what we did to Peter Scarelli.
That's funny.
I don't think about it at all.
Yeah, go home and sleep it off, Avery.
Tomorrow wake up and go to work.
That's all any of us can do in this city.
You were okay with him killing that ranger?
No.
But it's not like he asked.
You know, he's got a thing for frontier justice.
But Veld takes the fall for this and...
He's right.
I do.
Where's Avery?
Heard about you and your partner...
Where is he?
Everything all right over here?
We're looking for the gentleman
He had me bring, like, four rounds of apple juice.
On the rocks.
He said it was part of some prank he was playing.
Apple juice... he wanted you to think he was drunk.
What did you guys talk about?
Did Barton know he was here?
You're in my way, Detective.
Riggs, it's me.
Avery isn't here.
I think he's in trouble.
All right, Bailey's got a cell ping from his car.
Looks like it's at a house in Carson.
You got an address?
Okay, 4415 Moreno Drive.
Last homeowner is a Peter Scarelli?
You can kill me here, but it's just a matter of time...
Shut up.
I'm not killing you.
Sins of the past.
Let me introduce Peter Scarelli.
Do you remember Captain Avery here?
He's the man who framed you for murder.
So, here's how this happened.
The well-respected captain couldn't let bygones be bygones when confronting the recently released inmate who he had sent away years earlier.
He risked his career to get rid of him once.
He decides to do it again, but this time things don't go quite his way.
Luckily, I was on to him and you, and came to save you.
But you got here a little too late.
Oh, man.
Yeah.
That's Avery's car.
It's them.
How do you want to do this?
Delicate.
Roger!
You know, I was never really good at math.
But I think that weapon's empty.
Ah.
I've been waiting for this.
You know how you said we're not that different, you and I?
Huh?
Wrong.
You're under arrest.
Headed home.
I just wanted to thank you for finding the men who did this.
Oh, well, I had a little help, you know.
Not exactly "one riot, one ranger" around here.
Mm-hmm.
Oh.
That was your ranger's.
You know what, son?
I think Mark would've wanted somebody like you to have it.
Thank you.
If you ever decide to get back out to Texas, could use a ranger like you.
I got to keep 'em honest out here.
Hmm.
Where's your partner?
I wanted to thank him, too.
And apologize.
I wasn't exactly all
Houston charm when we first met.
Well, he's with his family, but... he's got a real Texas son of a bitch as a partner, so he's used to it.
You stay safe, Detective.
You keep 'em honest out here, Riggs.
So this is it, huh?
You resign, and Reed keeps his job at Sheriff's.
That's how it works.
He can prove my involvement, I can't prove his.
Barton destroyed the recording.
When this goes public, they're gonna charge you with a felony, and then every arrest that you made, including the 400 with me as your partner, is gonna be thrown out or subject to appeal.
Regrettably, yes.
That means hundreds of criminals that we put away might be back on the streets.
Yeah, but... this is what I've come to realize, even if that weren't the case, even if I could go back and keep what I did a secret,
I wouldn't.
What do you mean?
Those convictions are my convictions, too.
So this is about both of us, okay?
You made a mistake, a big one.
But you're gonna find a way to live with it.
And you're gonna make every day you do this job going forward all about doing it the right way.
It's all kinds of complicated.
But this is what we're gonna do.
All right.
All right.
Besides... there's something going down tonight.
And I'm gonna need as much backup as I can possibly get.
All right.
Hey, Mayfield.
It's Daddy.
You sure you want to do this?
I have no choice.
So you really think you can bowl another perfect game?
We just wanted to say you did right by putting Barton and his guys away.
They made the whole department look bad.
But that doesn't mean there's a man or woman here that believes you bowled that perfect game.
Hey, listen,
I just, I just wanted to say that...
How does $1,000 to the charity of my husband's choice sound to you, huh?
If we put $1,000 in there for the charity of our choice when he doesn't.
Oh, honey, you're not gonna get that.
'Cause he will.
And, uh, nobody likes raising the stakes more than me, but, uh, gambling in California's illegal... $2,000.
Nobody questions my partner's bowling skills.
Look out, Jack.
Hey, buddy.
Yeah, everything okay?
Uh...
It wasn't quite perfect.
I-I'm sorry, what's that?
I rounded up.
I bowled a 290.
You roll a perfect game right here, right now, nothing else matters.
I can't, I'm unclean.
Listen to me, you're gonna do this for you, you're gonna do it for Trish, for the LAPD.
Because I don't have the $2,000 to cover the bet.
That's a lot of pressure.
You got it.
All right, let's go!
Okay, Mayfield.
Focus.
Then release.
Whoo!
Yeah!
