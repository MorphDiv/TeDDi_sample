Ever wonder what it would be like if your 11-year-old kid earned more in a week than you do in a year?
Welcome to my world.
I'm Tony Carter and this is my house in Milton Keynes, the one with the yellow shed.
That's where my son Harry came up with Honc, an app to help him talk to girls.
That used to be my shed.

Anyway, I don't really get social networking.
If I did, I wouldn't drive a minibus for OAPs, but it seems to have gone massive.
Harry still can't talk to girls, though.
Now some big tech company wants to pay millions for it.
But will it change us?
Nah.
He's still working out there.
That's every day this week and all last weekend.
Mmm.
Liz, can you put down Ellie's diary for just one minute?
I'm worried about him.

He is the head of a multi-million pound business.
He's a boy, Liz.
Come on, let's have a word.
Oh, I'm just at a good bit.
Liz!
- Are you all right, mate?

You've been in here a very long time.
Honc work.

OK, but you've been in here all day.
Do you want to go for a wee-wee?
Covered it.
Mm.

Oh, my little soldier.
This is so lame.

There's nothing lame about Wild Boys Wilderness Survival Group.
And you'll never guess what?
This is all a horrible dream?
Your old man's coming with you.
They needed another adult.
It'll be great.

Surviving off the land.
I've got Honc work to do.
I've already checked it with Isla.
No, mister, no more work for you.
You need to get outside and taste the great outdoors.
I can look at the outdoors on my laptop.

You're going.
Right, I want you to have this with you at all times.
If anyone wants you to do anything that you're uncomfortable with, you press the button.
A bit much, Liz?
He's going to be sleeping in the woods with the Wild Boys.
Fair enough.
Come on, you pair of hot dogs.
Glenn, you run Wild Boys?
Run it, command it, whatever.
Tell you what, Tone.

Right, kids, it's Wild Boys time.
Wild Boys!
"Man has battled with nature,
"sought to tame her,
"control her, destroy her,
"but where man has failed, boys will prevail.

♪ Wild Boys!

Dad.
♪ Wild Boys!

Are you serious?
It'll be fine.
I forgot about his eyes.
His eyes are his best feature.
- OK, bye.

Channing Tatum?

Did you get a message, did you?
Was it something funny, was it?
A funny message on your phone?

I'm not texting.

Oh, Honc.
You know, if you ever want to talk to me about sex,
- it's totally fine.

Are you using contraception?
Are you pregnant?
Because I wouldn't mind.
I'd love a baby in the house.
I don't think I'm pregnant.
Well, we did have the talk, do you remember?
With the glove puppets?
Oh, yeah.
I'm not pregnant, then.
Now I've written "pregnant" instead of "yeah".
Can you sort of not talk to me while I'm messaging?
Fine.
What say we have a glass of wine?
- It's noon.

- Nah.

Well, for a 3-star restaurant, that was superb.
We're two stars now, after the rats.
Well, that's a shame.

Sausages perhaps weren't as herby as usual.
You might want to ask Chef to have a word with his butcher.
All of our food comes from a cash and carry.
Oh.
You having this mushroom?
Got anything planned for the weekend?
I thought I could just hang around here in my weekend scruffs.
You can't today.

- Oh, lovely.

Always a fight and some proper dirt.
Marvellous.

As my father always used to say, "Make your own fun, Oliver."
I'm trying, Father, I'm trying.
Oh.
- Wild Boys?

Good.

You'll see Tony here has a big box.
I'd like all of your telephones and electronic devices in the box.
What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, lads.
This weekend we're all going to be screen-free.
Away from all of your modern-world distractions.
So when the box is locked, swallow the key.
Swallow the...?

- Fine, I'll eat it.

I've passed bigger.
You too, Tone.
Phone in the box.
No way, I'm not missing the football scores.
You're a Wild Boy now, Tone.

Like Robin Hood.

I doubt it.

He would have probably had a scroll or a piece of, I don't know...
All right, all right, all right.
- Fine.

Now, this weekend we'll be earning Wild Boy badges by surviving nature's harshest wilderness.
Hello.

I've been alone in my hotel room all morning.
Reading all the labels on my toiletries.
And I started to worry I might be going mad.
Come in, Oliver.
So, what are we doing?
- I'm on Honc.

One thing.

Well, I'm pretending to be a child.
- Why?

Meet Antoine.
He's 16, he's French, and he recently moved to the area.
I completely made him up.
He's dreamy.
Ellie seems to think so.
It's private, Oliver.

One thought occurs, miss.
Isn't this a massive breach of Ellie's privacy and also technically grooming?
Are you a mother, Oliver?
- No, no.

Anyway, this is that most me and Ells have spoken for ages.
Yes, but she thinks she's speaking to Antoine.
So?

Is it really a lie?
Yes, it's definitely a lie.
_
Wow.

See, this is OK, isn't it?
In a way.

It's just all about having a solid stick matrix.
Yeah.
- Dammit.

I see somebody's certainly mastered the Wild Boy Erection Challenge.
Seriously, Glenn, call it something else.
- And can I have a kip now we're done?

This from the man who cried at Harry Potter.
The Prisoner Of Azkaban is actually a very dark film.
Let's just see how hard you are, Tony.
It's time to hunt for our food.
Are you ready to kill?
Getting there.
What's your favourite film, Antoine?
- Donnie Darko.

What are you adding now?
Antoine's just telling Ellie how much he loves hanging out with his mum, sharing secrets, being mates.
This feels wrong.
Although it is very in keeping for Antoine.
He would go out of his way for his mother.
You all right, Mum?
You don't mind if I hang out and chat with you for a bit, do you?
No, Ells.

Yeah.

Oh, go on, then.

I trod on this by mistake.
Oh, good, Ben.

Right, so, 1 mouse between 12 people.

Are you seriously telling me you didn't bring any food?
Oh, yeah, a friend of mine brought the food actually, Tone.
You might know her.

Seeing as soft millionaire Tony doesn't want to hunt any more because he's broken a nail...
I'm going to break your face in a minute.
Then it's a good job I came to an arrangement with a local farmer about putting on some lunch.
Who likes pork chops?
- Yes.

- Yes.

- Yes.

No...
Well, we've got all that and more.
All we have to do is catch it first.
Wow.
Bloody hell.

I can't believe how much Antoine telling Ellie how much he loved hoovering actually worked.
Yes.
Ellie really is staggeringly suggestible.
Still no word from Tone.
I suppose I better check in, see how he's getting on.
No!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Problem?

Antoine just sent Ellie, "How's Wild Boys, Tone?
"Miss you, Liz."
This is all your fault, Oliver.
How do I do delete it before she sees it?
Unfortunately, the app doesn't have message delete capabilities.
You see, there was a problem with various operating systems available on the market.
Just get to the point.
Well, you can delete sent messages from the desktop version.
Laptop.
Crap, that's in Ellie's room.

Where's the button?
Delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete...
- Should you be deleting everything?

You're in the wrong window.

Oh, Lord, that's a whole coding screen.
Mum!
I don't know what you think you know about the French language, but it's very difficult to understand, and some French words look like things that your mum might say to your dad.
Honc is down, and there's this boy I like, and I can't get a hold of him.
- Honc is down?

Don't you realise what this means, Liz?
- You've crashed Honc.

Tony, Oliver here.

Certainly one that you could flag as, if not red, then a very red hue of amber.
Really need Harry back home to fix it.
Hope all is well with you, and speak soon.
- Still nothing?

I'll try and get the group leader's number and keep calling around.
Meanwhile, you should try and fix the other problem.
What problem?
The massive abuse of your daughter's trust?
Oh, that.

I wouldn't be too sure.

Honc is down.

There she is.
You fancy a bite to eat?
I'm too upset to eat.
Apart from a sandwich.

You're not still thinking about this boy, are you?
I miss him so much.
I've written a poem about him.
- Great.

"Antoine, you're like a revolution.
"Antoine, have you ever eaten a swan?
"Antoine, I hope you haven't.
"Because I like swans.
"Antoine..."
Lovely stuff.

You know what boys are like.
He might even have a girlfriend.
He better not.
I've told all my mates about him.

Why don't I take you shopping, and buy you loads of stuff?
You love your mum when she buys you loads of stuff, don't you?
I love my mum all the time.
It's like Antoine says.

Maybe Antoine was getting a little bit carried away when he wrote that.
That was the fastest pig I've ever seen.
Uncatchable.
Still, not to worry.

Finally!
Fresh bird eggs from the forest, mushrooms from the ground.
- Picked them myself.

Those mushrooms don't look right.

Trust me, Tone.
I know my mushrooms.
Sure none of you want any of this omelette?

I've had enough of this.
It's cold, I'm starving, and you're mental.
So...
I'm ordering us take away, and I'm checking the football scores.
Yes, take away!
- Dammit, GPRS.

Tone, Tone, Tone.
You know the rules.

Sorry,
I'm going to have to ban you from all future Wild Boy challenges.
Same for you, Harry.
Thanks a lot, Dad.

Since when do you care?

- Wild boys!

It's not lame.

Can I check my Tinder?
Do you love your new iPad?
Honc is still down.

Forget Antoine.

He's hot, isn't he?
I think he fancies you.
Mum, I don't care about other boys.

Love him?

Look, wait here.
All right?

- Have you got a girlfriend?

- Great.

A mum asking me out.
What's going on?
It was a simple misunderstanding.
You see, I was pretending to be a teenage boy on the internet, but it all went wrong, so I needed to find a different teenage boy to...
No, wait, that does sound bad.
Look, it's just a mix-up.

I'll wait for you.
- Can I come in?

I'm sorry, son.

But I'm going to help you be the best Wild Boy ever.
We are going to win every challenge, and get you every badge there is.
Honc is down.

Also, Arsenal won.
Glenn, I'm taking charge.
My son's website has crashed and we need to go home now.
And if you don't like it...
- Yep, yep.

Yeah, I'm fine.
No.

Not the mushrooms, though.

Right, Wild Boys.
Wild Boys!
Glenn is down.

So from now on, I am your leader.
But...

You four make a stretcher.

The rest of you, pack up.
I'm taking us home.
♪ Wild Boys!

Good stretcher, this, lads.
Quality knots.
Good work.

Sorry about that.
♪ Wild Boys!

Hey, what's the matter, son?
I don't know which path to take.
I don't remember us being here, and it's not on the map.
Well, think, son, think.

I've got it!

We have to go north.
And moss only grows of the north sides of tree stumps.
- It's this way.

- Google maps.

Wild Boys, on me!
If I end up marrying Antoine, does that mean I have to be French, or can I stay English?
Marrying?
OK, Ellie.

There's something you need to know about Antoine.
- I created him.

Antoine's your son?
- No.

That's like Game Of Thrones.
No, no.

What you think is Antoine is me.
But you're not French.
- Are you?

What I'm trying to say is that Antoine isn't real.
I made him up so I could talk to you.
He's not real?
No.

What about everyone else?

Dad, Harry, Oliver Going out to the dashed forest myself...
Yeah, they're real.
I've told all my mates about Antoine.
They're going to take the mickey when they find out.
Well, if your mates are the kind of people that take...
Yeah, I know, then they're not my real friends.
No, then lie.

And then you're the popular girl with the dead French boyfriend.
I'm sorry.

- You're killing Antoine?

No, it's fine.

It's just a lot to take in, and...
I'm just going to need a few minutes.
- We made it!

Tony, I failed the kids today.
You got us out of there.

It's only right that I do the honourable thing.
I'm stepping down as head Wild Boy.
What're you talking about, Glenn?
My badge and my gun.

You shouldn't have a gun, Glenn.
- It's a starter's pistol.

Right, buckle up, kids.
We're going to break a lot of speed limits.
Next stop, Milton Keynes...
Has anyone else stopped seeing in colour?
... via the hospital.
Hi, Trent, it's Oliver here.
A bit of a problem, this end.
Kind of an amber, going on red, going on super red.
Now I don't want you to panic...
Nothing.

No time to explain.

Dad, I'll need a Cherry Coke and two Creme Eggs.
It's fixed.
And we'd still be in those woods if it wasn't for you knowing that stuff about the moss.
Do you think you'll go back, then?
No.
Mum, look.

Someone set up a JustGiving page for his family, and they raised 250 grand.
I gave £50.
Yeah, I know he's not real, but I do miss him.
I think it's best if we all keep quiet about Antoine and wait for this to blow over.
You're not too upset, Ellie?
No.

His name is Marco and he's from Spain.
- Really?
