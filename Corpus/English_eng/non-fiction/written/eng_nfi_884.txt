Mr. Cuthbert, do you know where she's headed?
The orphanage.
There she is.
- Make way, make way!

Did she run away?
No.
How did she seem?
Quiet.
She was real quiet.
Didn't say a word.
Miss.

Right this way, miss.
Who are you?
I'm supposed to fetch you, miss.
I don't understand.

Why, your family, of course.

- My family?

- Let go of me.

I've got some lovely sweets in my carriage for the ride.
Get away from me!
Ahem.

I've been sent to take you home.
Oh, good evening.
I was wondering if you could spare a fresh horse?
Sorry, sir, don't have one to lend.
Mine's dead beat and I need to get to Charlottetown.
Please!

Sorry, but I can't oblige you, sir.
I'm good for it.

- Sir...

Money or not, I'm afraid I can't help you.
These here belong to the guests and the hotels are spoken for this evening.
You're welcome to rest yours here for a spell, though.
Sam!

Sam!
- Sam!

Matthew Cuthbert, whatever's got you all twisted up?
Are you heading to the vessel?
Yes, we're riding to the port overnight.

Can I hitch a ride?

- I'm not riding in back.

Much obliged.
Mare!
I told you that brooch meant a great deal to me.
- Confess at once.

Or I'll send you right back to the asylum.
I took the brooch outside with me.

Tomorrow you will go.

But I made that up!

Enough!
Shut your face from now on!
We're sick of you and your stupid stories.
- Hold her down.

- ...stupid stories.

- ...

Anne Shirley!

Quickly now!
Quick!
Quick!
Whoa, easy, easy!

Oh, please hurry!

Stack some wood in the kitchen.

Marilla!
Marilla!
I have to go!
Wait!

Wait.
Thomas rode out at first light.

- Where is he going?

Only reason I could see for Matthew tearing off yesterday was to fetch Anne.
When we didn't see them return, I was so worried...
Please step aside, Rachel.
- I knew you'd be beside yourself.

No, listen, dear.

He'll check the road as he goes.
What if he's lying dead in a ditch?

- Marilla...

Enough now!
What if something horrible has happened and it's my fault...
Stop it, Marilla.
Boy!
Thomas is miles ahead of you.

- Take the rig back in.

Give me your hand.
Watch your step.
Careful now.
Be careful.
Now... come along inside.
We'll put the kettle on.
- Hello, Mr. Avery.

- My word!

And I'm sure we'll become better acquainted on the ride.
The ride?
The matron was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking me to the nearest train station.
I'm going home to Halifax, you see.

Ah....

It seems a wealthy aunt was just discovered and sent for me.
Isn't that wonderful?
Yes, it is, but I've got several deliveries to make...
My years of torment and uncertainty are behind me.
And I'll have to learn all manner of comportment, but I feel equal to the task.
Certainly sounds like you're moving up in the world.
I am.

It's not that I mind, but trouble is,
I've got several stops along the way.
It'll be a few hours, I'm afraid.
If you're in a hurry, you might find a better mode.

No, no, no, this will be perfect.
And I'm sorry I don't have any money to pay you, but I'll be happy to help.
Well, uh... well, al-alright.

Off me go.
So, now, what do you think?
Don't know how much I can get for it, with this here monogram.
I...

Then we are well met.
It's a family heirloom.
Show me something in here that ain't.
I don't know.
I'll think about it.
Why don't you come back tomorrow?
All I need is train fare for two up-island and ferry rides back and forth to the mainland.
Any idea how much that would come to?
I'll see what I can do.

Extra, extra!
Scientist predicts greenhouse effect!
Extra, extra!

What time does the ferry to Nova Scotia go?
'Round about 5:00.
Local boy loses life by drowning!
Out of the way, mister!
Ah!
And I believe my parents traveled to India and many faraway lands before they were killed tragically in service of the queen.
You don't say.
I imagine they were ever so noble.
Easy.

Alright, off you go.
Going!
I'm told I'm fleet of foot.
Oh, yes?
Now, I'd rather be beautiful, but you can't have everything.
Alright.
- Hop!

- Mm.

I was going to learn.
The lady at my last household in Avonlea said she would teach me.
Hmm.
Doesn't matter.
Hungry?
No, no, I couldn't deprive you.
Oh, help yourself.
Got plenty.
Well... much obliged.
Walk on.
I'm famished, actually.

- Matron trying to starve you?

They didn't feed you this morning?
Well...

What with my life starting over and all.
Uh-huh.

- Who?

Oh, right.
Espionage.
There.
That's the best I cando until the doctor comes.
It's been hours.

- Anne...

Fetch him some water.
- Anne...

- You're going to be fine.

- You had an accident.

Oh, no, no, no, no...

- Don't get up.

The ferry.

Where am I?

Where's the ferry from here?
Hello?
Hello?
Someone?

Hello?

Oh...
Oh, my word!
Please...

Get away!

- I must speak with the matron.

- It's an emergency.

No, there's been a mistake!

My little girl, she's here.
I came to fetch her.
Please.
Come inside.

Thank you.
Were you out there all night?
What happened anyways?
- There was a misunderstanding.

- Hurry up.

You've been fighting.

Kitchen's this way.

I'll give you a bit of hot water for washing up, and we'll take a look at that bandage before you see Matron.
- Oh, no, there's no need.

Uh... much obliged.
'Morning, Miss Cuthbert.
Do you need something?
For me?
Merci.
There's plenty more.
Thank you.
Yes?

Yes, good morning.
I need to take Anne Shirley home.
She was adopted.

But she... she came back here yesterday, did she not?
- She did not.

But... she has to be here.
The ferry master said that he'd seen her, said she come across... yesterday.
Red braids!
Oh, I remember her distinctly, but the girl is not here.
Tsk.

Oh!
Gave me a start.
- Beg your pardon.

" Where Hope and Fear maintain eternal strife;
And fleeting joy does lasting doubt inspire;
And most we question, what we most desire!"
Thank you!
Ladies and gentlemen, the express...
Excuse me.
May I interest you in a poetic recitation spoken aloud with dignified emotion?
It's only a dollar.
Fifty cents?
I need a train fare to Halifax.

Excuse me, sir.
May I interest you in a rousing tale of heroic deeds and acts of bravery?
It'll pass the time.
Pardon me.
May I transport you for a few minutes with a romantical recitation replete with the tragedy of a love unrequited?
"If thou must love me, let it be for nought Except for love's sake only.
Do not say, 'I love her for her smile - her look - her way of speaking gently, - for a trick of thought that falls in well
- with mine, and certes brought..."

"...a sense of pleasant ease on such a day..."
Anne!
"For these things in themselves may be changed, or change for thee, - and love, so wrought, may be un-wrought..."
Anne, thank goodness I found you.
So Marilla must've found the brooch, then, because I am not a thief.
Now, if you'll please excuse me,
I'm in the middle of earning some wages.
I've got a train to catch.
"Thy love dear wiping my cheeks dry..."
- Please, Anne...

It was a terrible misunderstanding...
Thank you anyways.

But I'm not finished.
We've heard quite enough.
Do you want your money back?
Anne, please... listen to me.
I've come to take you home to Green Gables.
Why?

I am my own family now.
And I am all I need!
- Anne...

No, wait, wait.

I-I've come for you.

Oh, bully for you.

I had to come all this way because you didn't want me!
I do want you, Anne.

I would appreciate it if you would leave me alone.
Please.
- Please.

Oh, I'll give you a "please."
Please have the decency to let me be!
Is there a problem here?
- Yes, there is.

No, no... we're fine.
This man is indeed bothering me.
- That so.

Whoa...
Well, it certainly took you long enough to fetch her!
Oh, sorry to... cause you worry, Marilla.
Hello, Miss Cuthbert.
Hello, Anne.
It's nice to see you back.
Please take your things up to your room.

We're having a simple supper.

Just come down when you're ready.
Yes, Miss Cuthbert.
Well, I'll see you downstairs.
You'll be wanting the egg cups?
Yes, please.
Did you bring your laundry down?
Yes, Miss Cuthbert.
Please attend to the toast.
Excuse me.
Of course.
On the table, thank you.
I'll be out, uh... by the potato barns today.
I might send Jerry to the smithy with the bay for shoes.
I'll pack him a lunch.
Alright.
Alright, then.
It was so awful, Belle.
When I saw the orphanage again, you can't imagine my dread.
And now I'm back, but I'm not so sure...
You're back?
How dare you sneak around listening to my private conversation?
I wasn't listening, I was sleeping.
- So you're lazy and a snoop.

There was so much work, because Mr. Cuthbert was away.

What all did you hear me say?
Why would I care what you say to a horse?
I need coffee.

- Why do you have that plate?

Careful.

No, no, the lady brought it to me yesterday, when she was distraite.
Why anyone would worry over you is a mystery for sure.
Ah!
Hey.
Ah...

I never would've thought to sell poems for train fare.
And you're home in time for the church picnic.
Did they tell you we're hosting it here?
I'm really glad you're back, Anne.
Well, you're the only one.

Oh, don't say that, Anne.

Miss Cuthbert wasn't happy to see me at all.

But...

- Not possible.

Rachel Lynde feared she'd take sick.
Not possible.
Well, that's what she told Mother.
Then why doesn't she show it?
It's hard to believe she was sorrowful when she doesn't seem to like me at all.
At least you're home.
I've missed you.
And I don't mean to seem ungrateful.
And it did fill my heart with joy to be back at Green Gables.
But I feel they could send me away at any moment.
But now that it's all settled, why would they?
I just don't want to get too attached.
Not if it's all going to disappear.
Catch.
"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved of you and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends."
It's quite confounding.
Why send her away just to retrieve her?
Confounding indeed.
I hope those old Cuthberts aren't losing their marbles.
- What do you mean?

I mean, I hope they aren't becoming addled, dear, as seniors are wont to do.
They hardly want to, darling.
I don't like this biscuit.
Then don't eat it.
Well, it can't be a peaceable household, it simply can't.
The girl is an orphan, after all.
How does one know what one is really getting?
- One doesn't.

It's not like she wanted to be an orphan.
- Of course not, dear.

Ah-ah.
Hello!
Rachel.

Here we are, here we all are.
Glad to see you, Matthew.
Welcome home, Anne.
Thank you, Mrs. Lynde.

Glad we didn't find you in a ditch.
Yes, yes, dear, everyone appreciates your gallantry.
Well, we aim to please.
Marilla, I hope you're feeling better now, dear.
- Were you poorly, Marilla?

- All is well, thank you.

One big happy family.
My, my.
Looks like the Cuthberts have picked up a stray.
Stray dog.

No need to be uncharitable.
Do you suppose they mean for her to be a daughter or a servant?
Doesn't she have awful red hair?
I wonder if she'll be attending school.
What is the world coming to?
I hear they plucked her from an asylum in Nova Scotia.
- A lunatic asylum?

Of course, it could turn out to be one and the same.
Oh, dear.
We'll just have to... persevere.
You're a little orphan!

Garbage girl!

Anne?
I'll go.
Anne?
Leave me alone.
Anne...
Did you feel a sense of obligation?
Is that it?
Because I would've been fine on my own!
Better than here!
Why would you send for me if you didn't even want me?
But we do want you, Anne.
It's obvious you don't!
I don't know what to do.
I have a question for you.
I wonder... will you forgive me?
I am very sorry, Anne.
When the brooch went missing, I was quick to judge.
But what's worse is that I pushed you to fib.
What else were you to do?
Makes me shudder to think of it.
And of course, I know now that you were telling the truth.
You are a truthful girl, Anne, even now, and that is an admirable quality.
This was my fault.
And all that you went through because of it.
It's a wonder you came back to Green Gables at all.
If you could... find it in your heart to... believe me... and... forgive me then we can start anew.
Anne!
Yes, miss Cuthbert?
Please come down to the parlour.
And "Marilla" is just fine.
What do you mean?
You may call me Marilla.
Oh.

You may not.
But I'd love to call you Aunt Marilla.
It would make me seem as if I really belonged to you.
Well, I'm not your aunt and I don't believe in calling people names that don't belong to them.
- Well, we could imagine you're my aunt.

Do you never imagine things are different than they are?
I do not.
Oh, Marilla, how much you miss.
Well, speaking of names, we'd like you to sign this and take ours.
If the idea appeals to you.
I've got the pen.

This is your family Bible.
You want me to be a Cuthbert?
A real Cuthbert?
We do.

I'm going to belong?
We hope you like the sound of Anne Shirley Cuthbert.
Anne?
I do.

But...

That's it?
Of course.
What's the matter?
Well... seems a little perfunctory, don't you think?
Perfunctory?
Shouldn't we... shouldn't we hold hands over a running stream and pledge ourselves to each other as Cuthberts forever?
Or prick our fingers and mingle our blood as a symbol of our lasting devotion?
Well, surely there needs to be a ceremony of some kind in honour of such an auspicious moment.
As someone who has never belonged to anyone before,
I believe that this is a matter of much solemnity.
Don't you?
What say you, Marilla?
Well...

Perhaps we could all have a small glass to celebrate without any danger to anyone.
Oh, Miss Cuth...
Thank you, Marilla.
That would do nicely.
Well, then... to the Cuthberts.
- The Cuthberts.

Oh...
I could develop a fondness for this.
It's time for you to sign now, Anne.
Oh my.
I can't believe this is really happening.
Calm yourself, Anne.

Yes, I am.
I don't think I've ever been so excited in my whole life.
Oh... my hands are shaking.
Hoo.
With this pen I take you...
Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert to be my family forever.
To call you mine... and to be yours.
For always.
Anne Cuthbert.
Oh, I should add the Shirley.
I'll do it over.
Anne...
Shirley Cuthbert.
It should be hyphenated, don't you agree?
I'll add that in, too.

Anne.
Could I add Cordelia, too?
I've always wanted to be a Cordelia.
Anne...
Cordelia...
Alright, that's enough now.
