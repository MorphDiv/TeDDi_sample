How long have you and Georgia known each other?
Forever.
Professor McDermid.
She is the reason why people take this module.
The Solasta Women's Initiative was set up by myself and my brother Alistair McDermid.
What, are you guys minted off these internships or what?
What sort of work do you do there?
Coffees and photocopying.
We're not all like that.

- You don't even know them.

Where's Georgia?
It's not her.
You don't get it.
What?
But you will.
♪ You, you have me hooked again
♪ And now I have no choice
♪ But to follow
♪ I'm sinking faster
♪ I'm sinking faster, yeah
♪ I'm sinking faster into the deep. ♪
'Hey, it's Georgia.

'Hey, it's Georgia.

- Hi.

- Sorry for hassling you.

Georgia's been gone for two days.
I'm really worried about her.

Not today.

I'm worried, that's all.
- Is she inside?

- You don't know?

I'm sorry.

Hey, Holly.
Louise.

Can you let me in?
- I've got a tutorial.

- This is a really bad time for us.

I just need to know where Georgia is.
I'm sorry.
Holly, wait.
- She's not inside.

But she was.

And no-one thought to just let me know?
I figured she'd call you.
You're really not our priority right now.
I just want to know if Georgia's OK.
She's fine.
- We'll be fine.

What happened to Fay?
Leave us alone, Holly.
George?
What the fuck are you doing in here?
- Georgia wouldn't mind.

- Sorry.

Sorry!
Elizabeth, I know you're out there.
I wrote down their full descriptions... and I can report them to student support.
Where is she, Elizabeth?
Why won't she tell me what's going on?
Sometimes... .. you think people are your friend
- and it turns out they're not.

Have you called her mum?
She's not worried.
She's done this before?
Never without me.
Something's up.
Stop it.
So, you were there when she jumped?
Fuck me, Holly.
Can you imagine being that determined that you'd do that?
Terrifying.
That and Georgia ghosting me, it just...
So, she's there now with that crowd?
- Apparently.

No, I told you.
Sorry, I was just trying to...
You need to think about something else.
That or drink more.

Thanks.
George?
I'll wait.
I was going to call you.
Are you OK?
Yeah.

Where have you been?
Around.
With those girls?
Yeah.
What's going on?
They've offered me a room in the house... so I'm taking it.
- Look, this isn't...

You didn't even know her, Holly.
Neither did you.
I get that you're upset, OK?
What happened the night you called me?
- You were scared, something was wrong.

- I know you.

You're lying.
Something happened to you and I want to know why you called me.
I fucked up.

We went out and I got off my head again.
- That's all.

I don't want to.
Do you understand me?
I'll call you.
Don't shut me out.
I'm not.
Who did these?
They were my friends.
But you fell out?
Because of what you did?
Would you like a hot Vimto?
This is the time they select, I suppose.
Not usually quite this early but it wouldn't be completely out of the question.
What are you talking about?
The Solasta Women's Initiative.
They take in a new girl around this time and then sometimes another couple later in the term.
Fay Brookstone was a no-brainer, obviously, but Phoebe Parker-Fox didn't get taken until her second term.
How long have you been looking into all this stuff?
The Solasta Initiative, I mean.
I... heard about it during Highers.
Do you know about the girls?
Well, it's good to have an idea of what they're looking for.
Tell me.
Louise Taggart, 21.
She's from London, she got her maths A-level at 14, got selected in her first term, obviously.
She works with the investment professionals in analysis, with the high net worth individuals.
I like to call them Hinwis.
Why?
I find acronyms funny.
She's in her second year, so I reckon she's going for a permanent Solasta position.
She writes software for fun.
Rachel Maddox, 20.
Moved around a lot, but she could be Scottish in a posh way.
She got selected last year, worked her way around the department and then got chosen as Alistair McDermid's executive assistant.
People say she's the one that got Mr McDermid back to work after his wife died a year ago.
Phoebe Parker-Fox, 21.
Her dad's an earl of somewhere or another and supposedly she interned in HR.
Getting selected means she's cleverer than she makes out but I'm not sure how much HR-ing she actually does.
And Fay?
Fay Brookstone, 21.
Got the Solasta Internship in her first year and rose quickly.
They covered it in the paper.
Could you tell she was unhappy?
No, not at all.
She had a permanent position waiting when she graduated.
She was always smiling... .. in newspaper articles.
I put them on my wall.
I wanted to be like her.
We're here to remember Fay and give people an opportunity to share their memories of her.
I'd like to take a moment to thank Fay's work family at Solasta who facilitated this event.
If anyone has anything they'd like to say, please feel free to come forward.
Fay didn't like this sort of thing.
She'd have laughed about all of this.
She was one of the most impressive women I've ever met.
Basically taught me how to survive work and uni.
People are going to say stupid things about Fay but if you knew her, you knew Fay was strong... brave and clever.
- 'What are you doing here?

What did he say?
It doesn't matter any more.
Wait.
Are you one of them?
You look like one of them.
- What's your name?

Holly, go and sit down.

- Fuck off!

OK, you're just like all the others.

Go.
- Just calm down.

'Fuck, you're green.'
I'm glad you came.
I wanted to pay my respects.
I was meaning to check in with you... .. about what happened.
I wish people would just say it.
We were both there.
She killed herself.
Fay killed herself because she was desperately unhappy and we missed it.
I missed it.
- Georgia's a great girl.

It's natural that you'd feel a little... thrown by all this, a little jealous, maybe.
- I'm worried about her.

I just think that you should let it go.
Try and engage with what you're feeling, with what YOU want.
I'm just trying to help.
I don't need your help, Professor McDermid... .. unless you want to write my essay for me.
It was Georgia's idea... for us to come to the same uni.
And that's been tricky?
Not in the beginning.
What changed?
We met you.
You don't get it.
But you will.
You're perfect.
"I'm an intern.
"Coffees and photocopying."
What do you want, Holly?
Hey.
Hi.
You texted me?
- Wishing you didn't?

- What's the occasion?

You going out, or are you asking me over to fuck you?
I don't know.
My head's all over the place.
We're students, we're supposed to feel like that.
I feel a bit mental.
You're OK.
You're fine.
- You not feeling this?

- Go for it?

I usually fuck people who aren't bored by the prospect.
Shit, I didn't mean it like that.
It's fine.

Another one.

She wasn't expecting me.
Sorry.

No, that's fine.

I felt bad about earlier.
Must have all seemed a bit dramatic and...
- Hey, man.

I just wanted to check in on you, maybe see if you were free tonight.
Obviously I'm interrupting so I'm just going to fuck off.
Sorry.

Another time, yeah?
Who was that?
Rory.
- Cool.

So he just swung by?
Sweet.

- Don't...

- I didn't ask...

- He left?

- Awkward.

Sorry, I didn't mean to cause any trouble.
No, no, it's fine.

- You're dressed up.

Come out with me.
Sorry.

For what exactly?
Katie McDermid's fundraiser.
Alistair's wife?
It's Edinburgh...

- Don't you like free booze?

Today was...
I know.
Alistair thought about it.
It's been planned for months.
Too late to call it off.
Was everything OK?
With the guy in the church, I mean.
James?
Yeah, he's OK.
I...

- At Charlie's party.

- Were they...?

He'll be all right.
Wait, I...
Hi.
Hello.
You coming?
Firstly, thank you so much for coming.
I mean, let's not sugar-coat it --
I've got you here to shamelessly ask for your money.
I'm slightly less embarrassed when I look around and recognise so many close friends of Katie's.
Most of you watched her pour her heart and soul into the fight against breast cancer and the charities that support women tackling this horrific disease... every day.
We're here because it's just over a year since my beautiful girl left us...
.. and because she'd strike me down if I didn't carry on the work that she so courageously undertook.
Even when she was ill... .. even when the days were very dark...
So... .. I hope you'll all dig deep tonight...
.. for her and everything she fought for.
Have a great night, everyone.

(That was beautiful.)
- Are you OK?

It's a party.

Must be nice to be a guy.
Relax.

OK.
Just pretend you're not surrounded by rich people, and every single one of my colleagues.
Will do.
Hi!
- So you know the new girl, right?

- Big night for them.

- Chance to show the whole world they're spectacular.

Alistair's.
Do you want me to introduce you to the big boss?
In a minute.
Talk to me a second.
Oh, great, we're going straight in, I see.
Have I done something?
Will you just stop with all that shite?
Are you incapable of having a good time now?
Something really big is happening to you, we should talk about it.
Should we really, though?
Can we not just get on with our own shit?
It's not a big deal, OK?
It's weird.
They're weird.
You're being paranoid, you know that, right?
I really don't think I am.
You're scared of people.
It's like you're 11 again,
- convinced that everyone's going to turn out to be...

You want to help me?
- With what?

Talk me up.
For what?
They need to think I'm clever.
- You are clever.

There's our target.
Louise is quick.
Tell me what you're doing.
Christ!

There you are.
Who is that?
That is Lucas Steiner.
He is richer than Bono.

So Solasta manages his money?
Yeah.
- Feels like a game.

Their friend just killed herself.
A Solasta intern and we're here drinking champagne and networking.
Steiner was Fay's catch.
She was on his relationship team.
She wouldn't have wanted that to be messed up.
So, they're competing for her job?
Well, yeah, if you want to be really brutal about it.
Is James on the Steiner team?
Do you always ask so many questions?
You just said Fay and James were on the same team.
- So...

Does he know what happened?
- Holly...

You're a lot, you know that?
Drink, talk, repeat -- right?
You need to work on your date conversation topics.
- This isn't a date.

Totally.
Oh, James!
- Sorry.

Erm..

Hello.
Interesting transcript girl.
- Holly.

- Just caught me trying to escape my own party.

It's, em, occupied.
Oh, well.
I'd be scandalised but this party is for my wife and she loved that kind of thing.
Would have made her laugh.
She sounds like a great woman.
Yeah, she was.
Although this all makes it a bit, um...
Kind of makes it harder, doesn't it?
When everyone remembers them as some kind of a saint.
Make them not real any more.
The person you knew.
Yeah.

Everything all right?
Fine, fine.

Excellent.
Let's grab another drink.
Stop it, Phoebs.

- Hello, Holly.

Everything all right?
I was looking for Georgia.
As per.
- George?

Don't suppose you've got one of those going spare?
Be my guest, darling.
There's always some dickhead after you when you've got coke.
Promise not to follow you around all night.
It's not like she paid for it.
Oh, I paid for it.
- Slut.

I just wanted you guys to know.
Thank you, Holly.
How are you all doing?
We're OK.
Now you have to, like, work.
It's kind of our business.
Well, at least the coke's nice.
- Have another.

Hey, girl.
Hey, girl.
- Ready?

Charlie, get me a drink.
- Hey, Mr Steiner, let's see if you can dance.

- Come on!

- Just, come on.

You're making a tit of yourself.
- You're a lightweight.

You're not like them, can't you see that?
- Too far, I'm guessing?

Did anyone tell you what happened to Fay Brookstone?
- Who's this girl?

- Let it go.

Like, what the fuck went wrong?
Right.

Lucas, what are we telling you?
Get off me, George.
Holly, let's go.
Right, I think it's home time.
Get her the fuck out of here.
I'm sorry.

Come back.
Come back.

I'm sorry.
I don't think we saw the best of you tonight.
Are you talking about me offending the honoured guest
- or boking all over myself?

I'm not usually like that.
I don't lose control, ever.
- Why not?

A long time ago.
You can't live your life keeping control of everything.
- Why did you come tonight?

- I think it's because you're ambitious.

This isn't about your friend any more, do you get that?
- I want in.

The truth.
Thank you.
So, you're in.
- What?

Come on, Holly.
Why do you want in?
I want to do something for myself.
- I need to.

- What?

You can't resist.
You have to put things right.
Because of what you did.
Show me who you are, Holly McStay.
Where's the party?
Nowhere, I have to work the last bit.
All right.
- I'm still here for when you want to go.
