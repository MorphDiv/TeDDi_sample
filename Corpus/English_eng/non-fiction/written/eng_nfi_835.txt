Penn Zer... ( screams )
( screeching )
( British accent ) Thanks for helping me look for my keys.
The pockets on these grass skirts just aren't deep enough.
Hey, remember when we blacked out a few weeks ago and didn't remember what happened for a couple of days?
I kind of feel like that's happening again.
( Zapping )
( normal voice ) Hey, all right.
We're back in the beautiful Purple Forest where everyone and everything is super attractive.
Except for...
Ugh, let's get this over with.
When we left here, the "beautiful" Princess was to marry the monstrous Grinkon.
But since then, the Princess hired an expensive Purple lawyer, who found a loophole to get her out of the marriage.
We must help her and the Grinkon see that they are each other's true love and go through with the wedding, because when they kiss, the power of their love will protect the village from annihilation.
Affairs of the heart can get pretty messy.
Also, you're leaning on my butt.
What are you doing out here, Princess?
My legal team of Bradfield, Maglinn, and Leibowitz advised me to heal my spirit by communing with nature.
Or you're hiding because you're too much of a coward to break things off with the Grinkon face-to-face.
This filthy cesspool with legs makes a valid point.
( Growls )
Grinkon, I summon you!
( Crashing )
Rarr!
Set me down, Grinky.
I need to speak some difficult truths.
Let's make sure we've thought everything through.
Like all living things, you are precious.
But, as with the ugliest of living things,
I am completely repulsed by you.
Deep in the bowels of the earth, there may be some sightless, unfortunate creature, without the gift of smell or intelligence, willing to lower itself to accept you as a mate.
( Sniffling ) Well, don't worry.
You'll never have to see me again.
( Grinkon growls )
( gasping and groaning )
( Groaning )
Ahh!
Well, I sure hope there's somebody for me out there.
Probably not.
I think I made a terrible mistake.
Ya think?
Ooh, I could really get used to these powerful mech suits.
( Whirring )
But the Princess must not marry her true love, or her light will be powerful enough to defeat us.
Yes?
I have a plan, Your Majesty.
Don't listen to him.
Hang on.
I got to be King both because I inherited the role and because I'm a good listener.
Please continue.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm-hmm?
We should order some pizzas.
This is going to take a while.
Oh!
You two need a real connection.
You must have something in common.
The Grinkon likes fighting and destroying stuff, just like Sashi.
And it better be romantic.
( Screaming )
( woman singing upbeat song in native language )
( toot )
We're just gonna have to fake it.
It doesn't matter whether we get a green cake or a blue cake, right?
We'll take the green one.
( laughing )
Boone, I hate to pull rank, but I'm the hero, and I say we're not going to throw off our entire color palette with a blue cake.
I'll throw off your color palette!
Boone, this is no time to be childish.
( Both grunting )
Thank you for agreeing to have dinner with me, after all the horrible things I said about you.
Well, I guess it's for the best that we broke up then.
We have nothing in common except for being incredibly beautiful.
I mean, what are your hobbies?
Um...
I love breaking things... ( Sashi's voice filtering through reed )
I love breaking things with my bare hands.
( Garbled voice )
Well, everyone thinks smashing's better, but there's nothing like feeling something crush between your fingers.
♪ Could you ever hold a Grinkon's paw?
♪ I could sing a song of hope and light ♪
♪ I would live a life of good and right ♪
♪ Could you ever dream a Grinkon's dream?
♪ I'd spend my life with someone gross as you ♪
BOTH: ♪ The grossness tells me I love you ♪
Okay, this may sound crazy, but... we could still get married tomorrow.
Hang on a sec.
( Garbled voice )
Say "yes," you idiot!
All right!
That's my boy!
Initiate your ingenious attack, Lieutenant!
Sire, I really think this is a bad idea.
( Guests chattering )
( bagpipes playing )
I got to admit, you were right about the bagpipe player.
And you were right... about nothing really, but still.
( Bagpipes stop )
We are gathered here today to join these two in purple matrimony.
Does anyone here see any reason why these two should not be wed?
( Guests gasp )
I am the Purple Prince of Purple-cisco, and I've come to wed the Princess as foretold in the Book of Things... ( stammering ) That Will Happen In the Future.
Uh, no one's buying this, Rippen.
I told you this was a stupid plan!
Don't blame the plan.
Somebody didn't sell their character.
No matter!
Our ridiculous, not to mention humiliating, distraction still bought time for the Kronad army to attack!
( Gasping )
You foolish, defenseless forest people!
( Gasps )
Ha ha ha ha!
( Growling ) Whoa, whoa, whoa!
The only thing that can save your people is your love, so let's get to the vows you've written for each other.
I promise to crush... to crush and break everything except your heart.
And I promise to always... ( grunting and stammering )
My metaformsosis is complete.
This is what I'll look like forever!
Dang.
( Garbled voice )
Just marry him!
( Garbled voice )
The wind whispers its eternal wisdom...
Don't marry that grotesque thing.
The wedding's off.
Prepare to die!
You are the most shallow, self-absorbed, diva brat I've ever...
It's okay that she's not nice, or loyal, or honest, or trustworthy, or decent, or tolerant, or respectful, or humane, or ethical, or moral, or generally polite in any way.
But we shared a song together, and it was awesome.
And what I've come to realize is that ( sniffs ) deep down, I'll always love her.

( Muffled ) I love you.
( guests gasping )
( Sobbing )
Ugh!
I bet we're gonna zap out before they serve the cake!
I wonder what happened when we blacked out this time?
My keys!
