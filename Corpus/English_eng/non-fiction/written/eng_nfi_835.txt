Ah!
Joe?
Joe?
Oh!

Oh no!
911.

Oh!
Emergency, what is your problem?
Hello?
Hello!
Good morning, professor.
Good morning, Joe.
Would the tranferees from Professor McDeere's class please give me a show of hands.
Welcome.
I know it's rather late in the term but the syllabus is the same so it should be a pretty smooth transition.
Especially since we're on our last topic, which is... ethics and law.
Two words not often spoken in the same breath.
Ignore it at your own peril, ladies and gentlemen.
You could risk ending your career before it's even begun.
So remember, only fools...
- Break the rules.

Yes!

Some of you may know him from the silent movie era.
"Man is animal, with primary instincts of survival.
"Consequently, his ingenuity has developed first,
"and his soul afterwards.
"Thus, the progress of science is far ahead of Man's ethical behavior."
What do you think he means?
Yes, Mr. Vaughn?
I think he's saying that, while primary instincts are inborn, ethical behavior has to be learned.
Exactly!

So, who of you bright, young, would-be lawyers can tell me what we mean by "ethics"?
- Miss Hart?

Yes.

Would anyone like to elaborate?
Oh, come on.

No one else did their homework last night?
Yes, Mr.?
Van Sickle, Vance.
Ethics are a set of rules codified by an established society.

Well said.
That doesn't make them right.
Like morality, they're just a set of arbitrary rules imposed on us by society.
You are quite the cynic Mr. Van Sickle.
Moving forward, just so those of you who just transferred in are clear, in my class we follow the rules.
Moving on...
Who can give me an early example of a code of conduct?
Anyone?
How about you, Mr. Van Sickle?
Mr. Van Sickle?
Mr. Van Sickle, I was asking if anyone could give me an example...
You can find the code of conduct pertaining to law in the A.B.A.'s Rules of Professional Conduct, 1983.
And you thought I wasn't listening.
A.B.A.'s
Rules of Conduct.
1983.
This particular code helps us to negotiate the ethical minefields of a courtroom.
Pay particular attention to...
Rule 3, the responsibilities of an attorney to the tribunal.
Read my lips, people.

This rule plays an integral part in your mock trials, which... are your final exam, and 60% of your final grade.
Okay, time is up for today.
Don't forget to check the board for your presentation times.
Mr. Van Sickle?
May I see you, please.
You wanted to see me,
- Professor Grandacre?

Look, I just want to make sure you're not one of these students who thinks they can rely on their good looks and their charm just to get a good grade.
Absolutely not!
I'm on full scholarship so let me assure you,
I take my grades very seriously.
Good.

Good.

I've worked very hard to get where I am today.
Very hard.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mrs. Grandacre.
Sounds like you really shut her down, man.
Listen, if anyone can handle Grandacre, though, it's you.
You already know it!
Do you think that's about McDeere?
How should I know?
They say he OD'd on his meds, man.
You need a ride home?
No, thanks.

Vance!

Claire Hart?
Daughter of the Donald Hart, as in, Lawson-Hart School of Law, Hart?
The one and only.
You have got no shot.
Care to wager a beer?
You're on!
Hi Vance.

Yeah, I'm glad you did too, Claire.
Oh.

Arthur was just leaving.
What?
Oh.

Nice meeting you.
Bye.
So, I just wanted to tell you that I saw on the board we're going to be trial partners.
Wow!

Looks like I have my work cut out for me.
I mean, with all that free advice...
Oh, no.

My dad says doing this on my own will make me a better lawyer, so...
That's one of the many reasons many reasons I don't go to his school.
Probably a smart move.
So why did you pick defense?
Don't you want to get the bad guys?
I prefer to make sure innocent people are not wrongly convicted.
Yes, but you're going to wind up defending the guilty a lot of the time.
I'm okay with that.
You will be mine.
Oho!

Come on!
Dude!
Vance, are you crazy?
Relax.

- I wouldn't have done it.

Bravo.
Hey.

What?

You got Claire's digits?

I guess I do owe you that beer.
Oh, you owe me a lot more than that.
I let you crash here at my awesome hideout.
Yeah, I don't really get it, man.
Why don't you stay here with me?
Your dad gave it to you, but you stay with your mom and your dipstick step-dad, who you hate, and he hates you.
No, man.

I like to just use it when I want to stay anonymous, you know.
Besides, I like to keep an eye out for my mom.
Make sure she's okay.
- Fair enough.

Here's that essay you wanted on civil disobedience.
You are a life saver.
Hey!

Don't I always?
Thank you.

And you're a profitable enterprise.
"While courts normally award damages to victims of negligence,
"those damages may be reduced if the victims themselves
"are found to be negligent.
"However, in a precedent-setting case, Gough vs. Thorne,
"the court decided to waive culpability
"in the case of a young child.
"Sui generis rule,
"setting aside previously established rule in order to impart justice."
You're late.
Dinner's getting cold.
Hi, honey.

Where were you?
I was at the library, working.
I'm so proud of you.
One more year and you'll be a real lawyer.
They serve beer at the library now, do they?
Go on, I made your favorites.
You were supposed to work with me at the garage today.
We made a deal.
I give you room and board, and you come down and help me.
With what time?
I carry a full load of classes and have to get perfect grades or I lose my scholarship.
He's right, Paul.

I'll tell you what I get.
Bills up the kazoo.
I bust my butt, twenty-four/six, just to keep our heads above water...
Maybe you should have worked harder in school.
You know what else I get?

And now I get a 23-year-old deadbeat, living off his old man!
I told you.

Damn right I'm not!
I don't go out boozing and stealing cars, and then... hang myself in jail.
What kind of a father does that?
And what kind of a man marries his brother's wife two weeks after the funeral, huh?
- I'll kill you!

Stop.

I'm sorry, Mom.

I'll be in my room... working!
Your kid has got no respect.
None!
Hey, honey!
You're late.
Yeah.

You know how that goes.
Yeah.

Isn't that the most gorgeous thing you've ever seen?
Hmm.

Besides, I thought I was.
You are.

And I was just about to click "purchase," too.
But, it's too extravagant, isn't it.
Sure.

- Can I splurge?

Is there anything wrong?
No.
- Nothing's wrong.

You're off in la-la land, somewhere.

Oh gosh.

It's one of these new transfer students of mine.
He is extremely bright.
I read one of his old papers and he analyzed this precedent-setting case like a pro.
It was impressive.
So what's the problem?
I don't know.
His overall... demeanor in class is arrogant.
Did this happen to take place during an ethics lesson?
You know how I feel when they don't take the rules seriously.
If I can just spare one of them from making the same mistake that I...
You can't.

The best you could ever hope for is that they learn something useful from it.
And honey, your only mistake was being a little naive.
But you learned that there are vultures out there, didn't you?
And you learned how to survive.
Damn it!
This ruins my case.
Can't use this.
Hey, Professor Grandacre.

Uh, actually no.

It's about the mock trial.

Ah, yeah, you and everyone else.
Listen, despite what you may have heard.
I, in no way, expect perfection.
Just do the best you can.
Yeah, but, I do... so if you could just switch me with someone presenting later?
No.

And it wouldn't be fair to the others or your partner.
It's what I said in class, isn't it?
The lame remarks?

It has nothing to do with that, okay?
I cannot offer you more time and not offer it to the others.
I can't make one rule for you and a different rule for the rest of the class.
What if there were extenuating circumstances?
Such as?
Look, Mr. Van Sickle, my best advice to you is just to buckle down and do the best you can.
Excuse me.
Yo!

I need to tell you something...
- Not now, man.

- Don't touch me, man.

Bro!

God!

And so, in summary, my client's speed was not the cause of the accident.
The main cause, in fact, was the plaintiff, running into the street.
Your Honor, according to the Doctrine of Comparative Negligence
I do not have to prove that the defendant's negligence was the sole cause of the accident.
Just a contributing factor.
Look, at 3:00 pm, in front of a school, regardless of his speed, it was foreseeable that a 6-year-old child might run into the street.
Foreseeable?

Is the prosecution suggesting my client should have been clairvoyant?
This was not a pedestrian crossing.
There was no crossing guard present.
The court must recognize that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent
In support, I cite the case of Froom vs. Butcher.
"In cases where
"the plaintiff's own culpable conduct is a factor
"the court shall reduce the award of any damages according to the level of the fault of the plaintiff."
Miss Hart, can you offer me any reasons why the court would not find your client culpable?
She's a child, your honor.
I mean, is that fair?
Be that as it may, this is a court of law.
As such, we are only concerned with statutes and precedents, not notions of fairness.
Can you cite any precedents?
I, um...
No, your honor.
I have one more thing to add, your honor.
Under the modified Comparative Negligence rule, if the plaintiff's own negligence constitutes more than 50% of the fault, the plaintiff is not entitled to any damages at all.
Wait!

The child did run into a busy street, between parked cars, your honor.
Objection overruled.
I do have one final question for you, Mr. Van Sickle.
Is there any reason you know of, why the court should not reduce the award to the plaintiff?
Well, based on the given circumstances and the current laws of this state, none whatsoever.
You're certain?
Well based on my research, absolutely!
Very well.
I, uh, find for the prosecution.
This court is adjourned.
What?

Congratulations, Miss Hart.
Are you kidding me?
I proved my case.
I am very disappointed in you Mr. Van Sickle.
Gough vs. Thorne.
Sui generis rule, "A child under the age of seven cannot be held responsible for his conduct."
You wrote an essay on it for
Professor McDeere's class.
It was eloquently written, in fact.
I could not have more strongly emphasized that an attorney has an obligation to fully disclose any relevant material.
My first obligation is to my client, okay.
It was the prosecution's responsibility to find the cases that support her argument.
Why are you penalizing me for her stupid mistake?
W-What?
Would you please excuse us, Miss Hart.
You well know, by not citing that case you broke Rule 3.
That case would have sunk my whole defense.
That is irrelevant.
You are missing the whole point of this exercise.
The goal was not to necessarily win but to play the game ethically.
You had other options, Mr. Van Sickle.
You could have argued that Gough vs. Thorne didn't apply to this case, or simply acknowledged that because of the child's age the award should not have been reduced.
Okay, well, how will this affect my grade?
Look...
Grades will be out next week.
- I need to know now!

What you just did was tantamount to cheating.
This is your final exam.
You know the penalty.
You think you can fail me?
You did this to yourself.
Let go of me, Vance.
Ugh!
Oh good.

Dean Castle wants to see you at 4:00.
Oh.

Here, it looks like you need this more than I do.
Am I misunderstanding?
Are you saying that the approval of my grant is somehow dependent on Mr. Van Sickle's grade?
No.

But, we cannot risk an appeal hearing.
Now look, Van Sickle is under the sponsorship of Lawson-Hart, at this university's recommendation, so, if they don't get the expected return on their investment they just might consider pulling future investment.
Catch my drift?
Oh, I'm starting to.
Other benefactors may follow suit and without that investment, we'd have to consider pulling other programs... like your grant.
The grant to establish an ethics board?
Huh, yeah, well, it's ironic I know, but, uh, no funds... no grants.
It's as simple as that.
Ugh!
Abby...
Look.

So, all I'm suggesting is that you investigate to see if there are other circumstances that might warrant consideration.

Look, he deserves at least that much.
Oh.

- He misled the court.

I would never condone breaking the rules.

But... sometimes you've just got to bend them a little.
Ahh.

It's an ethics class!

Okay, okay, fine!
Then, look, how about a compromise, huh?
I mean... have him have an "incomplete" now, instead of an F.
You know, let him do a make-up test or a paper or something, I mean...
A make-up test?

I'll give you a week extension.
Okay?

A week extension.

Fine.
Fine.

Okay, if he can get in an assignment by next week and you agree that his final grade depends on that assignment.
Fair enough.

See... a little flexibility.
No harm done.
Oh, no.

So tell me...
Just politics.
Hey, can you pull up McDeere's grades on a particular student?
Sure.
Enjoy your night, ladies.
Okay.
Okay, 4,3,2,
- 2,3,4.

Legal Profession A,
Van Sickle, Vance.
Is that the one that failed trial?
- Yeah.

Well that's an A-average.
- Oh, with your F.

Mullnomah Blvd.

Yeah.

He must have worked really hard to get here.
God, I can't believe I let him get away with that.
What was that?
He grabbed my arm today.

- Did you tell Castle?

Well, I tried.

Abby!

That is totally unacceptable!
Why wouldn't you go straight to Castle with that?
Don't you think I know that.

He had me over a barrel, okay?
No funds, no grant.
What are you doing?
What are you doing!
Were you planning to hide these from me again?
When did you start up with these?
You know what?

- Look at you!

- You are so wound up!

You're about to snap!
Is this kid somehow triggering some of your past issues, or something?
I have not seen you like this in a long time.
- Really?

My past issues?
Okay, why are you getting headaches then?
Why are you getting nightmares?
I see you at night, you're having nightmares.

It's been three years.

And what's next?

I think we need to find someone...
Oh, you want to find somebody?

A therapist?

Are they going to deal with this situation with the kid and Castle...
They can help you!
These pills... are not going to help you.
Are they?

I have had a really long day.
I am tired.

I want to wake up and start over.
Look.

I'll either get the grant, or I won't.
Okay, the, the situation with the kid and Castle, it will get resolved.
If this is still happening then,
I will talk to someone.
Okay?
Hey.
Hey.
You okay?
Uh...

What is it?
The same thing happened to him.
Who and what are you talking about?
The student that I was telling you about last night...
His father was wrongly convicted.

Okay.

I did that to someone.
I did that to someone and it and the same outcome.
We've been over this a million times.
You have to stop blaming yourself for doing your job.
Oh God.
Stan, that is easier said than done.
Look.

Abby?
Oh...

You're, uh, you're early.
Is this a bad time?
No.

You just caught me taking my allergy medication.
Sorry.
Allergies are the worst.

Huh.

- So you heard I appealed?

And I talked to Dean Castle, and he has offered a solution which I am willing to consider as long as we can come to an agreement.
I'm relieved to hear that.
Well, your past records have earned you that consideration.
Your lowest grade is a B.
That's impressive, and you've only gotten one of them.
I do realize the impact your grades have on your position here so that's why I'm willing to reconsider.
I really appreciate that.
Do you remember the day I stopped you in the hall and mentioned extenuating circumstances?
Well, I was reluctant to tell you the truth, because I...
I didn't want you to think
I was playing the sympathy card.
My mom's been fighting cancer.
Oh God.
Vance, I'm...

So when I found Gough vs. Thorne
I realized I'd have to rework my whole defense.
Normally I'd be up to the challenge, but spending so much time at the hospital... watching her suffer.
Then with my other finals... and helping out at home.

Did you ever feel so... overwhelmed that you thought you'd just... totally lose it?
Yeah.

I think everyone has at some point in their life.
So you, um, you mentioned a solution?
Um, yeah, yes.
Uh, Dean Castle and I agreed that should circumstances warrant, which I now see that they do, and you were willing to, uh, do a make-up exam by next week,
I'd be willing to change the failure into the deserving grade.
Wow!
Sure, I'll do anything.
My whole future is at stake.
I'm sure you'll do just fine.
I'll have the make-up assignment by tomorrow.
I don't know how to thank you.
Look, just follow the rules.

I understand your passion.
I read your father's case.
So now you know why I'm so determined to succeed here and become a defense lawyer.
To protect other innocents from false convictions.
Thank you, Mrs. Grandacre.
Hello.
Hi.

What did he do now?
Excuse me?
Vance!

Uh, no, no.
I'm sorry, I...

His stepfather.
Oh, okay, uh...
I was just calling to check because I was...
I was a bit concerned about Vance and all he's been dealing with, with his mother's sickness.
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm sorry.

My wife is perfectly healthy.
Look.

Professor, but I'd be careful what you believe.
Yeah.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What?
Hey!
Jeez!
Don't even think about touching those guns.

That's what my dad used to say to me.
Why are you so cranky, man?
Thought you said Grandacre fell for it.
Yeah.

But how the hell was I supposed to know she'd call my house.
She's gonna pull my make-up assignment from me now.
Man, you are screwed.
She's going to fail your butt!
There's got to be a way.
Think of something, dammit!
Have you ever searched her?
I mean, there's nowhere to hide on the net, man.
Maybe we can find something incriminating.
Come on.

I got this.
Whoa!

It sounds like your dad.
"Still proclaiming his innocence,
"John Ross, convicted of grand larceny,
"prosecuted by A.D.A. Abigail Grandacre hanged himself in a courthouse holding cell today."
You've got to be kidding me.
"The case raises
"embarrassing questions for the D.A.
"Especially since A.D.A. Grandacre failed to mention
"that there was a witness who came forward to offer Ross an alibi."
Then what?
Says she resigned before they filed any criminal charges.
She got away with it and she failed me on an ethics charge!
Wait, hold on.
Whoa!

A couple of months later she was put into a mental institution.
She's psycho, man!

I can use this.

You're not going to, like, do something crazy, are you?
I need a way to get into the grade site and change my grade myself.
Okay.

I mean, this site's probably fire-walled up the kazoo.
What are you going to do?

And you're going to help me.
No.

That's breaking and entering.
No, no, no.

All you have to do is be my driver and my lookout.
Well, unless you'd rather cop to cheating all year.
And you still have two more year's worth of papers you'll be needing.

I'll make you the deal of a lifetime.
You help me out and I'll give you all of my old A-papers... free.
Okay, but just the lookout and driver.
Hey.

Okay, bye.
Aah!

Mr. Fine.

I haven't graded your final yet.
Grant vs. Foster was the main case though, right?
If you make an appointment,
I will be happy to go over everything with you.
But right now I have a ton of papers to grade, including yours.
Okay, cool!

Excuse me.
Sorry.
Oh!
Have you seen him yet?
No.
No, I sent him a message informing him that the make-up assignment was off the table.
And I referred him to you.
Yes.

He sounded really desperate.
Look, in my book, there is no excuse for this kind of blatant dishonesty.
Actions have consequences.
Yes, they do.
For all of us.
But... you gave him every benefit of the doubt, as I asked.

Well.

Perhaps he'll find another way.
If nothing else, he certainly is resourceful.
- Have a good weekend.

Hello, professor.
Hey, I just want you to know, I understand.
You're just doing your job.
No hard feelings.
I will break you.
Are you threatening me?
Excuse me?

I couldn't hear you.
Mr. Van Sickle.
I think you'd better come inside.
Joe?
God!
What's going on?
I just saw something just run out in front of the car.

It looked like a person but it was faster.
- Hm.

A deer then.
I'm sure it was nothing.
I don't see anything.

Okay.
Dammit!
I don't like this at all.
Whoo!
Come on, man.
Alright!

Stan.

- What?

You okay?

I wasn't dreaming.

I don't hear anything.
Stan, please go.
Be careful.
That's it.

Check your office doors.
Locked!
All clear.
How did the book fall over?
Probably too close to the edge or something.
Oh my God!

Let's go.

Okay, I admit it.

Come to papa, baby.
Abby!
It's impossible!
So we've either been hacked, or... one of our bank cards has been scammed.
Honey, did you see the date and the time?
He was here last night.
He was in our house.

He broke into our house!
He was here!
Do you have any idea how paranoid that sounds?
All the doors were locked.

Okay, fine!

Well yeah, as a matter of fact.
Uh, it's one that you're not going to like.
But, isn't it possible, just possible... that you made a purchase and just
- don't remember it.

Well you've been under a lot of stress lately and all the medications you've been taking...
Two!
- I take two medications!

And you remember yourself.

It hasn't been that long.
Yeah.

Stan.
What is it?
What if I am losing it again?
And wh-what if this is happening all over again?
I don't remember doing any of that stuff.

I hear you.

And I'm sorry about earlier.
I wasn't listening to how you were feeling.
I think I'm ready to call Dr. Lieberman and get that referral.
Okay.
And I called the police.

Just in case.
Thanks, detective.
If anything else comes to mind, please call me.
I would suggest that you change your locks today and get an alarm system put in as soon as you can.
Especially since you guys are somewhat remote here.
It just made it easier for whoever this was.
Good.

A pleasure.
Hi.

Would you excuse us for a second?
I tried everything, man.
I was right.

I did some research.
There's only two other computers that have access, and they're both in Castle's office.
And the only person, besides him, that has access to change the grades is the assistant.
Then that leaves only one other option.
I make her change the grade.
I'm out, man.
- I mean it!

That's a lot better than hard time for assault.
Okay, we'll meet at your place, talk later.
Hello, professor.
Look, you can play-act innocent all you want.

I don't know what you mean.
No, you don't?

You didn't hack into my bank account?
Those are some serious allegations, professor, I...
I hope you can back them up or I might have to sue for defamation.
This stops now!
Do you here me?

Are you threatening me?
In front of all of these witnesses?
Get to class.

Why don't we just get to what this is really about?
You screwed up.
Nothing you say, nothing you do, is going to intimidate me to change your grade.
Oh yes, you will.
There's no evidence.
Even that cop you talked to won't find anything.
You change that grade or your life will be such hell you will beg for me to stop.
How dare you!
I assume you have somewhere where you should be, Mr. Van Sickle.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Abby, Abby, Abby, Abby!
Hey, you alright?
Yeah.

I, uh, I have to proctor.
- Excuse me.

Look, Dean...
Abby, look, I'm a lawyer too.
And I pass no judgments until I've heard all the facts.
Look.

Come and see me after your proctor.
Oh God!
- You okay, professor?

Please pass out your... tests.
Don't open them until the bell rings.
I don't feel good...
- Oh my God!

Are you okay?
Oh my God, Mrs. Grandacre?
- Call 911.

- I-I'm okay.

But you're going to go to the hospital anyway.
I love you, honey.

Oh please!

I'm going to follow the ambulance.
I'll be right there, alright?
- Mr. Grandacre.

Is she taking any other medication?
Uh, yeah.

Rembatol?
That definitely could be the culprit.
Especially if she took more than one.
She usually only takes one, occasionally, just to help her sleep.
May I?
Sure.
The pills actually look exactly alike.
The only difference between the two, is Marvan has
MAR etched on the side.
But they'll do all the blood tests at the hospital.
Well, we won't need to wait for those results.
This is Rembatol, REM.
That's him.

I'll take these.
So, it's the same as the McDeere case.
Medication switched.
Well, she's luckier than him.
She should be out of the hospital in a few hours.
I'm going to need a warrant for that Van Sickle kid.
I'm going to follow you for a while, alright?
Then I'll stop and get some dinner.
Okay.

Careful, please.
Thanks for picking up dinner, hon.
Of course.

Mmm.
Oh, that's the locksmith.
Hello.
Hello, Abby.
You're never going to get away with this, you little bastard.
Come on, counselor!
No evidence, no case.

The police can trace this call.
You honestly think I'd use my own phone?
Now look at that.
I see Stan-the-man is changing the locks.
Imagine what a long-range rifle could do right about now.
Pow!
Listen to me...
This is between you and me.
You leave Stan out of this!
- I didn't hear you say please.

Who's in control now, Abby?
You are.
Sorry.

You are!
Okay, look.

I'll do whatever you want, I don't...
You'll do whatever I want, and then maybe
I'll consider leaving you alone.
I'll change your grade, okay?
I-I don't even care any more.
Smart girl!
Now here's what you're going to do.
The deadline is midnight.
So you're going to call Castle right now, and tell him I handed in the paper and got an A.
And an A-minus for the course.
You got that?
No.

He's already left for the day.
I have an idea.

I can't tell Stan.

It's...

You'd better not be messing with me.
I told you.

Just meet me at 11:15.
What about security?
Uh, security, they see me come and go all day long.

How do I get in there?
I will...

I'll tell them that I need to bring up stuff from my car.
You've got yourself a date.
Vance?
When this is done, I get my life back.
Of course.
Well, apparently we now have the best locks money can buy.
Guess we should do the alarm next, huh?
I feel safer already.
I'm not going to feel safe until that lunatic is behind bars.
I keep telling you, that's not going to happen without any evidence.
Speaking of which, was Keyes on the phone?
- No.

- Tonight, if possible.

You just said that the locks are good, so what?
Besides, I...

I think there's an easy solution to all of this.

I'm going to change his grade, Stan.
I don't care any more, you know?
I'm through standing on principle.
We can't live like this.
Just promise me you'll do it over the phone, okay?
Okay.
Sorry to disrupt your dinner.
I'm looking for Vance Van Sickle.
So are we.
Haven't seen him in a couple of days.
Have any idea where he might be?
He's always gone for long stretches at a time.
May I?
I have a warrant to search the premises.
Can you show me his room?
Yes.

Where was this taken?
That's where his father lived.
No one's lived there since he died.
I'm going to need that address.
Vance Van Sickle!
Gun missing from a lock up here.
Clear over here!
Be thorough.
He's smart.
He knows the law.
Hey.

Abby?
Dammit!
- Keyes?

I need to speak to Abigail.
Professor?
Yes, Joe?
I unlocked the records office, so you're all set.
I'm off doing my rounds, so just lock up the front doors after yourself.
You bet.

4, 3, 2... 2, 3, 4.
You started without me.
I was just setting up.

Dying to know how you got my key.
No dying until you change my grade.
Seriously, how did you get it?
You type in "How to make a copy of a key,"
on the interwebs.
You were pretty clever about switching out my pills.
Ah, the resemblance was just dumb luck.
All simple.
Is that what you did to McDeere?
Because he gave you a B-minus?
Now if I told you that was the case, that would be a bit self-incriminating, wouldn't it?
Vance...
I'm ready.
Good.
What if I had died?
I wouldn't be able to change your grade.
I saw you only took two at a time.
Two Rembatol will mess you up, but it won't kill you.
Calculated risk.
Uh-huh!
Allow me.
Now that wasn't so painful, was it?
Vance.
This is Abigail Grandacre.

Abigail!
Abigail!
Abigail!
Abigail!
Joe!
Joe!

Dammit!
Abigail!
- Dispatch.

There's a gunman on campus.
Okay, backup is on its way.
Okay.

Security from the university just called.
Listen to me.
You stay in this car!
Security says they're in the administration building and Van Sickle's got a gun.
You two go that way.
You stay three steps behind me, you hear?
- Okay.

Hold it right there, son.
Drop it!
Okay.
Yes, sir.
Now, kick it over.
Aah!

Sounds like it's coming from the gym.
Day of reckoning, Abby!
Time to meet your judge and jury!
Or should I say, executioner.
Aah!
Back!
Hon, are you hurt?

Oh honey!
Are you okay?
Am I under arrest?
No!
No, Abigail, you are the victim here.
It's over.

It's okay.

It's over, honey, it's over.
Here you go, Abigail.
Well deserved!
The board unanimously decided that we could all use lessons in ethics.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
You are probably wondering why I wrote all the question marks.
Well, this quote from Jacob Bronowski offers an explanation.
"The values, by which we are to survive, are not
"rules for just and unjust conduct,
"but are those deeper illuminations, in whose light,
"justice and injustice, good and evil
"means and ends are seen in fearful sharpness of outline."
So, I have posted your first assignment on the computer blackboard, which is
"To find and explain ten definitions to the word 'ethics'"
and evaluate each definition to the following yardstick...
Are ethics or codes of conduct merely external sets of rules to be blindly followed?
Or, do they rather originate in the light of an inner illumination, viewed through a lens of a greater morality?
I have often had to ask myself the same question.
I, uh, have made the mistake and it cost an innocent life.
That's something that I have to live with.
And I would like to save you all from making the same mistake.
So, any questions?
I do, professor.
