- Previously on Power...

But I have one condition:
You don't make it look like a Toros Locos kill.
So, Tommy, what you, what you gonna do about a distro, man?
One of yours, a Toro, killed my distributor in cold blood.
I want our old territory back, and I want six new Toros Locos corners.
Look, man, if this starts a war, Uriel, we both gonna lose, man.
Rashad Tate.

And I heard about your interest in the Minority Trade Commission.
Bailey Markham, Joe.
I think he had evidence that would convict Egan and St. Patrick.
I think they made him disappear.
She's a fuckin' liar.

- Damn it, 'Riq...

Tariq, stop!
I'm your dad.
And I want to meet you.
This is the view of the main stairs right before the tape cuts out.
- Is that...

Hello?
Hey.

I don't want to represent your husband anymore, Tasha.
But we need you.
I need you.
Good morning.
We need to talk.

You here alone?
Not anymore.
What's going on, James?
Why'd you feel the need to come to my apartment this early?
It couldn't wait until later?
When's the last time you talked to Proctor?
I don't know, last week maybe?
You wouldn't have heard of any criminal investigation involving him, would you?
Proctor?

I haven't heard anything about any real charges.
Do you know something I should know?
No.
It's just that with my case still pending, of course,
I want to make sure he's not involved in something that could touch us, that's all.
Us?
Well, if you...

Were implicated in anything,
I'm quite sure I would've heard about it by now.
You want me to make some phone calls?
No, don't worry about it.
All right.
Well, if you don't mind.
I didn't know you had a lady.
I wouldn't call her my lady.
You know how it is these days.
It's a gray area.
Well, if need any help cleaning up around here,
Tasha can put you in touch with our housekeeper.
She's great.
Nah, I'm good.
Thanks.
I'll see you.
You still thinking about going to war with the Jimenez?
They haven't responded back with an answer on my offer.
Got me watching my phone like I'm hoping they gonna ask me to prom.
Look, we just met with them.
Yo, are the Serbians on board with this?
We handle this right,
Jason ain't got to know nothing.
This is some dirt that we can clean up ourselves.
And what the fuck are you questioning me for?
If we don't hear from them by midnight, you tell everybody to strap up.
Bodies are gonna fuckin' drop.
Well, you know I'm ready.
And the boys will be too.
Yep.
Three more trucks.
Probably four hours, tops.
All right.
I gotta go, but I'll hit you later.
Got some shit I gotta do.
Fuck.
Mike.
What're, what are you doing here?
Yesterday, Mak brought me in alone.
He said he needed some final information on Donovan.
Great, they're serious about looking at Donovan as the mole.
Yeah.
Did you talk to Mak alone too?
Nah, I haven't.
Why?
Saxe, you and I still have an agreement to work with each other, right?
To bring Greg's real killer to justice.
Come on, Mike, I want Donovan to pay for what he did as much as you do.
I find out anything,
I'll let you know.
Okay, we'll talk soon.
Tasha.
Hello?
Girl!
I saw you on television.
You sure that was the right thing to do?
Terry said that it was important for me to look like I'm standing right by Ghost.
So, I did it for the case.
Terry?
The lawyer, Silver?
Y'all still talking?
Yeah.
Look, 'Keisha, I gotta tell you something.
Mom?
- Hey.

Hey.

Raina.
What happened to your arm?
I just... bumped into someone at school.
Anyways.
What do you think about me going there?
What is this, a school?
Why do you want to change?
Let me see this.
You can see why she want to change.
Place looks like a got damn resort.
'Keisha.
Auntie 'Keisha, they have really rigorous academics.
My guidance counselor says they let a few kids transfer in over winter break.
Or in the spring.
But, baby, I just don't understand why would you want to go to a school away from your family all of a sudden?
I just do.
Will you think about it?
Please?
All right, sure, I will.
Go ahead, get your stuff ready for school.
All right.

Tariq, go ahead and get your coat.
We're getting ready to leave in a minute.
Hey, Mister Steve.
Hey, young lady, good morning.
Always good to be back in the neighborhood.
Of course it is.

- We ready to start?

Just waiting on one more party.
I thought it was just you and I.
Wanted to maximize the optics.
What better way than introducing you and one of the young kids you helped save from the neighborhood?
You're okay with that, right?
- Yeah, yeah, great.

Councilman.
- Thanks for coming down.

- James.

So, shall we get started?
- Let's do it.

So Mike came to your house last night?
Yes.

Told her not to tell me that he came by.
He didn't realize that I had custody of them over the weekend.
He thought I'd be home alone.
Maybe he just wanted to talk about the case.
Bullshit.
He told Mak that Donovan was the mole, right?
I think he went over there to kill you because dead men can't exonerate themselves.
Ain't that about a bitch.

Before I came here this morning,
Mike asked if we were still working together to prove Donovan is the mole.
I told him yes.
You doublecrossing piece of shit, man...
No, hey, hey, mistakes were made, maybe.
But if Angela's right, and he's looking to kill and frame somebody, we go to Mak, we better have enough for an arrest warrant, or we're all gonna be on Mike's hit list.
The tape shows him going up the stairs at Truth.
No angle showing him with the gun.
No footage of him planting it in the office.
It's a double, triple at best, no home run.
Do we have anything else?
Yeah.
I've got something.
St. Patrick gave me this phone.
It came from a Lobos contact,
Hugo Sanchez.
What?
How the fuck did he get it, Angela?
A couple of days before Greg died,
I called the last number dialed from this phone.
It was another burner cell.
Someone inside the Federal Building picked up.
They didn't say anything, so I couldn't tell who it was.
It wasn't Greg, because he was in Babylon at the time with Agent Medina, interviewing Kate Egan.
And if you didn't have that phone, Saxe...
And I didn't.
It was Mike.
He was working with Hugo Sanchez for Lobos.
He's the mole, he killed Greg, and planted the phone to cover his tracks.
You can't prove that.
Maybe Greg hid it in his own apartment
- because he was the mole.

He hid it after he wiped off his own prints.
And then he shot himself to cover it up.
And then his motherfucking ghost hid the murder weapon at Truth.
We can't introduce the phone anyway.
Where'd St. Patrick get it, Angela?
Did he tell you?
I thought not.
We're saying that a US attorney worked as a mole for a Mexican drug cartel, then murdered an FBI agent, framed that agent as the mole, then tried to frame a second man for the agent's murder.
Yes.
Okay, great.
And our evidence is an inconclusive tape and a burner cell with a shaky chain of custody?
Also yes.
If we're right, Sandoval's one of the biggest criminals in DOJ history, and we don't have shit to prove it!
It's not like he's gonna confess.
So what are we gonna do now?
All right.
Hey, listen, I want to see you at that next town hall.
Or I'm coming for you.
Hey!

Remember, keep the faith!
Bless you.

See, we reinvest in a community by establishing businesses that are owned by the people who live here or businesses that service them.
Now, imagine, health, education, fitness, arts, all in one.
The Queens Child Project.
- I like that.

A building that can become the new afterschool hub for our youth.
You got my ear and my full support.
Where can I help?
Well, you know better than anyone how difficult business can be in these neighborhoods.
The problem is, they're nestled deep in areas infested by drugs and crime, crime that only gets worse and worse by the day.
- Right?

And now, I have to figure a way to clean it all up.
The board wants as little resistance as possible when rebuilding.
But, James, this is what it's about.
This is our chance to make a difference.
And it starts now.
An opportunity to rebuild this community, the community I grew up in?
Come on, I can't be more excited.
I'm ready to get both these hands dirty.
That's what I want to hear.
Listen, if we don't get rid of these drug dealers, no matter what we build...
It won't be the change that you and I want to see.
- I'm sorry, I gotta grab this.

Yeah, Tate, yeah.
It would've been dope to have a spot like that when I was growing up in the hood, man.
- Yo.

I don't like surprises.
You can't give me a heads up?
Look, Tate called and said you'd be cool with it.
Keep the legit image and all that.
And these D boys, are those Toros standing on the same land I traded for Julio?
Yeah.

How'd Tommy's meeting go with them?
Look, man, Tommy had demands that they couldn't approve, so it led to him meeting with the Jimenez.
- Tommy met with the Jimenez?

And it didn't go well.
We was asking for territory and access to the ports in Cali.
They haven't responded yet, and Tommy's ready to strap up right now.
Honestly, I don't think that Tommy's thinking this through.
Shit.
So you need to talk to your mans.
A got damn war right now?

Where's Tommy right now?
Ma!
Yo, Ma!
Ma!
All right.
Turn that fucking shit off.
Two seconds in, you're gonna start with me?
Can we try to be normal?
Good morning, son.
The hell with that.
Tell me about my father.
Um... okay.
Um, same as I've always told you.
He left when you were too young to remember, and... he died a short time after.
Where did you meet him?
Atlantic City.
I was dancing at the Tropicana.
I told you this already.
Why do you want to know about your father all of a sudden?
Because I spoke to some guy named Tony Teresi last night.
Motherfucker said he was my dad.
He said he met you in A.C.
and that he likes redheads.

This Teresi, this... did he have any reason to fuck with you?
Yeah, maybe.
That is some sick fuckin' joke!
Maybe he knew your father.
Maybe that talked about me.

But he left us.
And he's dead.
And I don't want you thinking about it anymore, okay?
I don't know what this Teresi wants you to do, but if I were you, I would stay away from him.
Can I listen to Helen now?
Go ahead.
Sup, Ghost?
Yeah, fine.

Bye, hon.
I don't know.
- No fucking idea.

We'll know in a minute.
There you go.
All right, so listen up.
Gonna make this quick.
- What up, boy?

There may be a war coming with the Jimenez cartel.
With them Spanish niggas, bro?
Yeah, bro, so everybody needs to strap up.
From niggas on the corner to everybody in this room.
You call us down here to tell us that we're going to war with the Jimenez?
Man... .
Sound like a fucking Tommy problem.
Tommy's a hothead, Dre.

I don't know what he's thinking.

We get the order, we do what we gotta do and hold our ground.
Hold our ground with who?
I got kids running for me, not soldiers.
Yeah, and I got people I gotta answer to.
I can't just tell them that we're gonna go to war with the Jimenez because Tommy said so.
Yeah, he's right, Dre.
Why is this happening?
Doesn't matter why it's happening.
The connect wants to go to war, we fucking go to war.
I'll give word if we gotta move.
That's it.
Yo, Dre.
Yo, you sure you want to do this, man?
Of course not, man.
I just became the fucking distro.
I didn't think killing Julio would start a fucking war.
Yeah, well, doesn't seem like you're alone with that.
What's the next move then?
Look, man, I don't know, but whatever it is, we gotta be on the same page and we gotta be a step ahead of Tommy somehow.
Yo, Ghost.
I hear you want to go to war with the Jimenez.
Did you know Tony Teresi thinks he's my father?
That's why he wanted me to call.
I had my suspicions.

What did he want?
To get to know me.
Something about family being the most important thing.
- I asked Kate.

She said that he was full of shit.
But you was inside with him.

Is there any way that this guy is telling the truth?
You both got blue eyes.
I don't know.

- But, listen, about the Jimenez...

Sit around and wait for the Jimenez to take their sweet fucking time and finally decide to either agree to my terms, which they should have done in the room, strategize how to wipe us off the fuckin' map?
And you sure your people got your back?
You telling me they gonna go to the mattresses for Julio?
What about Chicago?

There's a way to legitimately force the Jimenez to deal, because we got history with them.
I told 'em I killed Lobos.
They didn't fucking flinch.
Yeah, but how did you tell them, brother?
Look, alls I'm saying is, they gotta play ball.
They gotta give you whatever you want
- because you got leverage.

I'm not sure I can win.
But I can't go back there and negotiate against myself because then they would just fuck me like the pussy I would be.
Yo, you so sure about this, why don't you pitch it?
I can't do that... how I look sitting down with a fuckin' drug cartel right now?
I'm thinking that if a fucking war backs itself up on you, you gonna look a whole lot worse.
I mean, you want shit done the way you want shit done?
You're gonna have to get those hands dirty.
I'll come.
Fuck.
No sudden moves.
What the hell, man?

I know it's your daughter's school.
I came by to talk to you a couple nights ago at your place.
I didn't expect to see John Mak there.
You didn't think you should tell me about that?
There's nothing to tell.
Really?

Bailey Markham, the guy who had Knox's recording.
They looked into his phone records.
They saw one of the last numbers he called was mine.
The cell tower above my place picked up his phone.
But by itself, that doesn't prove anything.
This is pretty fucking bad, Joe.
You're telling me?

And it's Tommy's fault that he let you get rid of Markham's body and the recording, too.
You think I fuckin' held on to 'em?
I think it's a way to protect yourself.
In case you get busted, sell us the fuck down the river to save you.
If I was gonna do that, I'd have done it already.
I'd be on the golf course right now in Arizona.
James, there is nothing for them to find.
No body, no recording, no murder weapon, no crime scene.
They are just trying to scare me to get me to say something, anything.
Which you won't do.
Which I won't.
Look, I don't know how to be any more clear.
And whether I like it or not, we are in this shit together.
This whole rolling up unannounced stuff, it's more of a Tommy thing.
Man, I don't know who to trust.
Still me.
If Mak reaches out again, you reach out to me.
Understood.
Who is it?
Yeah, I'm looking for Sammy.
He around?
- Sammy?

He'll be back in a couple of minutes.
He went down to the store for me.
Here.
Thanks.
Ooh, it smells good in here.
What you making?
Osso buco?
Yeah.
Come on in.
Egan, right?
Yeah, that's right.
I must have made an impression.
Hey, you look good.

I don't remember any Egans from the neighborhood in Brooklyn.
No, I'm from Queens.

Your parents, they from, Queens?
Yeah, my mom is.
I'm just asking because Tony never mentioned you.
Well, our business is new.
That's Tony, right here?
Yeah, look at that.
Teresi was a handsome man back in the day.
Yes, he was.
Hey, you got any water?
I do.

I also have, whiskey.
Now you're speaking my language.

So your mother, what's her name?
My mother?
Why you asking about my mother?
Just curious.
Well, you said you don't know no...
Egans.
I'm guessing that you don't know her.
Come on.
I bet she's got one of those pretty Irish names.
Moira.
Cathleen.
Siobhan.
I'm curious.
What's her name?
Kate.
Kate.
- Kate Egan.

You're right.

Sorry.
- Getting a call.

Yeah, I gotta bounce, but thank you.
Hey, good to see you.
And tell Sammy to reach out to me.
- Damn.

But careful, kitty got claws.
Mr. Jimenez.
- Please, call me Diego.

- Nice to meet you.

Tommy, good to see you.
Tommy.
- Good to see you again.

You must be Ghost.
So, we're still considering your former partner's business proposal.
Please.
Mr. Egan asked for quite a bit in exchange for the death of his distributor.
I must say first,
I take Julio's murder very personally.
That deal was brokered with the Toros Locos under you, Diego.
And I know that you pride yourselves on being people of your word.
True.
But we're here now.
We are here now.
We did you a favor with Lobos.
We knocked out your biggest competitor with no collateral damage done to your organization whatsoever.
You know that now, yet you still have not agreed.
We know what this is.
The Jimenez cartel's symbol, "La Araña" card.
Your organization has left that on...
Rough estimate here...
Hundreds of dead bodies.
Your reputation precedes you.
Nothing governs like fear.
But what if you were exposed as a fraud?
What do you mean?
He means what if they made it known we didn't kill Lobos, but we took credit for it anyway.
We all know that what matters most in this game is juice.
More than weight, more than money...
Money can't buy respect.
If you didn't kill Lobos, someone else did.
Someone else should be feared more than you.
You give us the territory, access to the ports, and your little secret is safe with us.
If you don't, you're exposed.
Wow.
Killing us ain't gonna stop the truth from getting out.
You think we so stupid we ain't got a plan B?
Diego.
So you would confess to this murder just to hurt us?
You would go to jail.
We have safeguards against that problem, Miss Jimenez.
The people who know what really happened, they're invested in our survival.
Access to the ports, the land.
It's only right after what happened to Julio.
You have until tomorrow to give us an answer.
We'll be in touch.
How'd it go?
They'll come around.
Still no answer.
If we don't hear from them tomorrow, we go to war.
Angela's saying I planted the gun?
That's impossible.
I never went into the office, and I most definitely did not kill Greg.
That's what I said.
I'm sure Mak will see it that way.
Wait, wait, wait, she's going to Mak with this?
Yeah, but
I don't think she has enough for a warrant.
The tape she has shuts off before you get upstairs.
And drink up.

Can I get a...
Sorry, II can't.
I gotta run.
Thanks for having my back, Coop.
You see this picture?
That's our house in Flushing, before we moved to South Jamaica.
And that little baby right there, that little baby is me.
So if my father is dead, who the fuck is Tony Teresi?
And why the fuck is he holding me outside our house?
If you lie to me one more fuckin' time, Ma!
Okay, fine.
- Fine, Teresi is your father.

Is that what you wanted to hear?
- My God.

Get the fuck away from me!
He came to the house.
He held you for a minute.
I took the picture.
Then he... he left.
He said he'd be back in a half an hour.
He never came back!
Tommy, don't you get it?
He left you!
He left us with nothing!
Whatever he wants, it's no good.
You can't trust Tony Teresi, Tommy,
I should know!
Tommy!
This is a surprise.
Sorry to come by unannounced.
I was hoping you had a minute.
Sure.

Can I get you anything to drink?
No, thank you.

Just came by to check in.
I feel like you and I need to talk.
Sure.
What'd you want to talk about?
You sure you don't any?
I know you want to talk to Mak about me.
You think I'm the mole, that I killed Greg.
You talked to Saxe.
I know it was you who passed along the information about Lobos's transfer.
And I know who you did it with.
Nice try.
But even if any of that were true, you'd have no way of proving I did any of it.
If you could, I'd be in cuffs right now.
What's that supposed to be?
That's you, leaving the Lobos contact Hugo Sanchez's apartment.
And that right there, that's Greg.
Here's what I think happened.
After you heard Sanchez was killed, you went over to his place to cover your tracks.
What you didn't know was that Greg saw you.
I was investigating.
The next morning, Greg called the Federales.
He was checking out that Lobos tip you supposedly got from them.
The tip that would have taken us across town from where we actually arrested him.
That was real information, Angela.
Later that day, he called you.
I think you went over to his place, and when you were there, the Federales called him back.
He must have realized you were the mole, and you shot him to protect your secret.
Angela, this is bullshit.
I know you want an answer for Greg's death, we all do...
When we were prosecuting St. Patrick, you handled Greg's phone records.
But you never mentioned the calls to and from the Federales, Mike.
You redacted them from the records.
There would be no reason to do that unless they implicated you.
What did Lobos have on you?
Did he threaten you?
Was it your family?

You have no idea what it's like to be in a situation where if you make one mistake, the person you love most dies.
He was going to kill my daughter.
Son of a bitch.
Did he just admit to being the mole for Lobos?
Sounds like a fucking admission to me.
We wait.

The last time this son of a bitch had his back up against the wall, he killed a federal agent, Mak!
My friend.

- Damn it.

I'm going in, Saxe.

You still have time to make this right.
We can go to Mak together...
I can't let you take me down, Angela.
I didn't have a choice, but you did.
I will go to Mak myself and tell him everything I have on you.
On me?
What, you don't think in all my meetings with Lobos your name didn't come up?
You don't have anything on me.
I'm innocent.
Innocent.
Mike, why do you have a gun?
It's a gun.
Gun.

None of us are innocent, Angela.
We all have dirty hands, especially you.
Whoa, what the fuck?

I don't know.
Well, get it back on, now!

I never wanted it to come to this.
But you just wouldn't leave it the fuck alone!
Mike, please, you don't have to do this.
There's another way out.
Turn around.
Mike.
I will say you became belligerent.
Aggressive.
I came over here to confront you, expose you as a coconspirator with James St. Patrick, and you... you came at me.
We struggled.

I had no choice.
It was selfdefense.
How will you sell selfdefense if you shoot me in the back?
What?
Fuck.
Look at me.
You still have a chance to cover yourself.
Why?

The FBI's gonna burst in here any second.
You don't have any other options.
You're not a murderer.

Go, go, go!
Angela, I need you to lower your weapon.
What?
Shots were fired.
Tag and bag it.
Get Sandoval outta here.
You all right, Angela?
I'm fine.
We made arrangements to lock him up nice and tight at the MCC, protective custody.
He went for his gun, I...
I only had a second to protect myself.
Look who it is.
God, it's good to see you.
You haven't changed a bit.
Stay out of Tommy's fucking life.
Like we agreed.
Come on, I'm an old man.
I want to see my son.
I'm only gonna say this once.
Stay away from Tommy or I'll tell Connie about us and about the son that she doesn't know about.
I may be stuck inside here, but it has never been a good idea to threaten me.
You take it how you will.
Stay away from my fucking son!
Take these, and go knock on that door up there.
Somebody come to the door, holler at 'em long enough so that you can peek inside.
You don't see nobody, you give us a nod, a'ight?
Think you can handle that?
Nigga, you getting ready for a fashion show?
Fuck you doing?
Man, I live in a neighborhood like this.
I'm a black kid.

Told you the little nigga knew what he was doing.
Can I help you?
Yes, I'm with the local school, and we're selling candy bars for our swim team.
And I was wondering if you could make a donation by purchasing one of our chocolate bars.
You swim?
Yes, 100 backstroke and 100 butterfly.
I'm trying to get my times right so I can swim at nationals this year.
My son swam when he was at school too.
Of course he gave it all up when he went to college, but
I'm sure your mother is very proud of you.
As long as I'm making her smile, it's worth it.
Come on in.
I'll check and see how much cash I have in my purse, okay?
Do you have change for a 20?
'Cause I don't... my God.
Yeah.
Say something, I'll blow your motherfucking head off.
Leave him alone!
Take us to the fucking safe now!

His little ass say anything wrong, you kill him.
No!
Shit.
You played the hell out of that shit, yo.
Sorry about the punch, I had to make it look real, you know what I'm saying?

You stay down here and keep quiet.
When you see me go upstairs, you get out of here.
We meet up later.
You're doing good, man.
Open the safe, fucking right now!
Fuckin' open up the safe!
No!
No, please, please.

Just go, I'm not gonna say anything.
Hey, yo, nigga, what the fuck?
- Get off her.

No.
Brains, tell him to stop!
I really wish you didn't just say that.
No, no, no, no, please.
I won't say anything...
Yo, where'd he go?
Tariq!
How exactly did we get here, Mike?
I'll give you everything you want.
In exchange, I want immunity.
And why would I do that?
Because if you don't,
I'll say that every single one of the hundred or so cases I closed was done with influence from Felipe Lobos.
And the scandal alone will rock the United States Attorney's Office for the next 20 years.
You'd be buried in appeals and wrongful conviction suits.
A trail from here to California with you as the head of the Mike Sandoval cleanup committee.
Your whole career, up in smoke.
Or you can give me what I want, and be the hero.
I'll see what I can do.
AUSA Valdes.
This is a surprise.
I'm sure you'll be updated, but an arrest was made in the murder of Special Agent Gregory Knox.
Mike Sandoval.
Mike Sandoval?
The Head of Criminal?
Jesus, that man stood in court and accused James of the same murder he committed?
He's being remanded to the MCC tonight, where he'll be held until his transfer to protective custody.
So James really was innocent?
Yes.

I'll give him the good news.
And Proctor too.
He won't hear any other way.
Sure, of course.
Thanks, Terry.
Terry.
What are you doing here?
Didn't mean to startle you, Mrs. St. Patrick.
The doorman let me up.
"Mrs. St. Patrick"?
Silver.

What's so urgent?

Way better than cool.
Last night, the FBI made an arrest for the murder of Agent Greg Knox.
My God.
What does this mean for James?
That he'll officially be cleared of all charges.
Are you serious?
I'm happy to say you are no longer in need of my services.
I'm sure you two have a lot to celebrate.
Listen, Silver, before you leave,
I know, you know, we haven't always seen eye to eye, but I gotta thank you, man.
So, who'd they arrest?
Mike Sandoval.
I'll be damned.
He's awaiting arraignment at the MCC, though.
I'm sure Mak and company will use the allotted 48 hours to question the hell out of him.

You know what, Tasha, I'ma go call Simon Stern immediately.
Relay the good news to him.
This news is huge for our project.
Again, thank you, Silver.
He came by my place the other day.
What does he know?
Nothing.
Well... well, we still need to be careful.
You left this at my apartment.
Shit.
I should get going, there's gonna be some paperwork that needs to be signed to make everything official.
Of course.

I'll let James know you had to go.
Look, Terry,
I know this is complicated, but I...
Well, why don't we have dinner this weekend and talk it over?
Okay.
Are you sure we can trust him?
We don't have any clue what Sandoval knows, Tommy.
Gotta know what we're looking at if he talks, I mean.
No telling what crazy motherfucking Lobos told him about us.
And we should proceed on that basis.
Sorry I'm late.
James, I took the precautions you suggested to make sure I wasn't followed.
Mind if I make one of those?
- Knock yourself out.

Well, this is some shit.
You being prosecuted by the man who pulled the fucking trigger himself?
If you'da been convicted, the appeal process would have been a fucking field day.
Yeah, well, he wasn't, so you can talk yourself out of that legal hardon you got thinking about it.

Yeah?
Yeah, we sure do.
Look, Sandoval's gonna flip, and fast.
The question is, what's he gonna say when he does?
If he knows you're Ghost, he can testify to that.
If he knows you two killed Lobos...
He tells them that, we're fucked.
And if he knows the two of you have been running a criminal organization this entire time, he could spell RICO prosecution for all three of us.
Not if he ain't alive to testify.
Sandoval's being held in the MCC.
He is a highvalue asset for the Feds.
It is only a matter of time before he's put in protective custody.
So this gotta go down right now.
But how?
We gotta find someone who we can really trust.
I mean, we not talking about just some fucking thug here.
We're sitting here talking about killing a fucking United States Attorney in a federal prison.
What about Teresi?
No way, Tommy.

Yeah, but we can trust what he wants.
Me.
If I ask him to do it, he'll do it.
Yeah, but what is he gonna want in return?
I gotta agree with James.
Why is Teresi an option?
Why would you think you can trust him?
Ghost, I know it seems risky, but what are you gonna do, break back in there and do it yourself?
This gotta happen and it's gotta happen now.
Are you sure about this?
What other option do we got?
Jeez, it took you long enough, kid.
I thought you forgot about me.
I guess you believe me now?
I need your help.
Well, if it's fatherly advice you're looking for,
I got tons of it.
Like never play cards with a guy whose got the same first name as a city.
Look, you got a roommate in there.
The guy's not good for me.
You got a name?
Just like that?
No questions?
No.
You're family.
Uriel, I hope for your sake that something of merit comes from this meeting.
Yeah, me too.
And you.
I'm sure Tommy or Ghost don't know you're here.
So what can I do for you?
What if I told you I could deliver Tommy's entire organization and I can do it without starting a war?
I'd probably stand here and pretend to listen to you, but I'd be wondering why it is that you're offering me this deal.
Because it's the best deal you'll ever get in your life.
Look, I don't know what you're getting ready to do, but I know Tommy going to war is wrong.
His hold on his primeras is weak.
They don't trust him.
But they trust me.

Cristobal?
Is that true?
Uriel?
He has the support of the Toros Locos.
You're here taking a position against your connect.
Why should we trust you?
Because I want to be the biggest goddamn drug dealer in New York City.
And I can't do that working for Tommy.
That's great, but we have plenty of primeras, plenty of territory.
Why should we take additional risks when we don't have to, when we can easily murder you right here and your friends by sunrise?
Gracias.
I have direct connections to the Bassett Hotel Crew.
They have over 20 hotels and nightclubs all across the world.
I can arrange that your drugs be sold in each one of those hotels and nightclubs.
A whole new revenue stream.
If you can do that... we'd be very much interested.
Thought you would.

We will give Tommy what he wants to buy you some time.
But you don't have forever.

If you fuck this up...
I'll kill you myself.
All right, man, you're all set to be transferred into protective custody.
Just give me a second to grab some antibiotics.
So let me tell them, yo...
It's done.
Cool.
Teresi came through, so... what do we got to do for him?
Nothing.
Yo.
Dre, talk to me.
Yo, so the Jimenez reached out to Uriel.
They agreed to it all.
Territory, access to the ports.
Everything.
No shit?
You damn right they did.
Spread the word, ASAP.
No war.
Ain't no doubt.
You really think you can pull off what you said to the Jimenez and Tommy won't know?
Absolutely.
They agreed to everything.
We both get what we want and no war.
- Look at that.

I guess we're still a pretty good team.
Absolutely.
Consider that community problem all taken care of.
We can now push forward to the next step and earn the developmental contract.
Wow.
Well, that's exciting news.
Here, sir, that's for you.
Thank you...
I do have to ask.
How did you do it?
Well, I knew some people that were familiar with that element.
They owed me a favor.
And, of course, I wanted to make it happen, so I made it happen.
What a day for Mr. James St. Patrick.
Fully exonerated and making a dent in the community.
Here's to the Queens Child Project.
Cheers to that.
Tariq.
That you, son?
Hey, I want you to come in here and meet someone special.
This gentleman right here standing in front of you with the gray suit is the legendary Councilman Rashad Tate.
You're too kind.
Councilman, this is my boy, Tariq.
Good to meet you, young man.

You been out playing ball?
Yeah, I was out hooping with some friends.
I'ma go take a shower and then start on my homework.
- Okay.

- Good night, sir.

- Hey, Dad?

Raina's been talking about this school in Connecticut named Choate?
Yeah, II'm familiar with it.
What, you want to go up there?
I don't know, maybe.
I heard they have some good science classes and some nice basketball courts.
Well, how about we talk about it in the morning, okay?
All right.
- Night, Dad.

- Good night, sir.

Got yourself a superstar on your hand.
- He's a good boy.

That boy's everything I've ever wanted him to be.
You're a lucky man.
Come on now, Rashad.
We make our own luck.
How the fuck does something like this happen?
Nobody knew he was here.
Nobody but us.
Marshals are interviewing the inmates who were in the area, but as of now, nobody's saying anything.
What a waste.
All his information dies with him.
Yeah.
Small leaf.
