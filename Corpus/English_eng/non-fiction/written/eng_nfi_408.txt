Morning.
Hey.

Yeah, Chale's gonna help me study before class.
Oh.
Okay, Mom, if you're gonna start juicing, you still got to hit the weight room.
Very funny.
No, I'm giving out flu vaccines at school, and this morning, I'm gonna give one to your dad.
Whoa.

Every time he sees a needle, he freaks out and faints.
I know, and that's why this time, we're gonna do things a little differently.
You're gonna shoot him with a blow dart while he's walking to the shower?
[Blows]
Like an animal.
No.
I'm gonna stick him with this little sucker before he even wakes up.
Like an animal.
[Softly] Honey?
Honey?
Ooh!
[Chuckles quietly]
Okay.
[Singsong] Gonna be so easy, 'cause he's so sleepy.
[Screams]
What the heck?

Ow!
I'm sorry!
I was trying to surprise you with the flu shot this year so you wouldn't faint when you saw the needle.
- What?

- Oh!

♪ I am not your ordinary guy ♪
All right, babe.

Where are you going?
- Oh, I'm going to Enzo's.

Yeah, once every five years, his grandmother sends this icebox cake from Italy.
It is life-changing.
It is just layers...
Graham cracker, chocolate pudding, graham cracker, chocolate pudding, graham cracker, chocolate pudding, graham cracker, chocolate pudding,
- graham cracker...

- I got it.

And then, it's chocolate pudding.
[Chuckling] Okay.

I get it, but why do you have to go so early?
Oh, 'cause if I don't, you miss it, then it's gone, and I got to wait another five years.
- Oh.

I tell all the guys "Hey, show up at 1:00,"
because I know they're gonna show up early to get the lion's share, so what do I do?
I show up 12:30.
Okay.

- Yeah.

Um, quick...

Fifth.
S...

It is fifth.

Fifth?

- Fifth?

No, it's fifth.

Well, change your face expression so I can...
Give me help here.
Oh, my God.
Enjoy your cake.
Um... oh, and when you're there, tell Duffy to bring his truck tomorrow.
His truck?

We're moving the pool.
We're moving the p...

What?

We talk about this every year.
You put it up in the wrong spot...
Underneath the neighbor's dead tree.
There's leaves everywhere, there's no sunshine, the water's freezing.
I mean, the thing is basically a giant squirrel urinal.
We're moving it.
All right, fine.

I will move it, but I can't do it tomorrow.
So I'll tell you what, we will sit down Monday
- with our calendars...

No excuses this time!
You realize you've been trying to get out of this for years.
Okay, I think you're exaggerating.
Hmm?
I can't move the pool today.
My toolbox is missing.
Goody's having a garage sale.
I feel a little nauseous.
It's gonna rain.
You got to give me more notice.
You know what it is?

Mets are in the playoffs!
It's an inner-ear thing...

I thought we were trying that chicken place.
I think my rib popped out a little bit in the front.
[Strained] It hurts.
Y-You know what it is?

Today?
[Muffled] Our pool?
Okay, fine.

- Thank you.

I am feeling a little something in my throat...
Nope!

Okay, here we go...
Enzo's grandmother's icebox cake.
It's been a good five years, boys.
[Chuckling] Dig in.
I'm just gonna come out and say it...
It's a little off.
It's a lot off.
I've been waiting for this forever.
I barely slept last night.
Not cool, Enzo's grandmother.
Ah, come on, guys.
She's 98 years old, blind in one eye.
It's a miracle she can hold a spoon.
I don't know.
I'm just saying, you promise you're gonna do something, deliver.
Exactly.

I mean, I'm gonna keep eating, but I ain't happy about it.
By the way, what was with that, uh, text you sent me earlier...
Something about bringing my truck around?
Oh, yeah.
I need all you guys to help me move my pool tomorrow.
Wait, I'm sorry.

Are you...

No.

I-I got to move it.
The neighbor's got a dead tree.
It's hanging over, it's blocking the sun.
It's a whole thing, believe me.
You realize what a hassle it is to move an aboveground pool?
What's the problem?
Just empty out the water, pick it up, and move it.
Hey, Groot, it's not a kiddie pool, okay?
There's panels and rivets, and don't even get me started on the...

Well, hold on for a second.
You said that the tree is blocking the pool, right?
So why don't you just get rid of it?
What do you mean?
Think about it.

We can't see the TV 'cause Mott's fat head is in the way.
What do we do?
Unscrew the brackets and move the TV?
No.

Exactly.
Hey, guys, I'm taking a lot of unnecessary shots here today.
So, let me ask you this.

To take down a tree or to move a pool?
No-brainer, guy.

Give me a chainsaw, phone charger, and a tuna sandwich,
I'll have that thing out of your life in 40 minutes.
Why do you need a phone charger?
I keep losing mine.
♪
So, you want to... chop down Mott?
It's a metaphor.

The leaves, the lack of sun...
That's all coming from the dead tree.
Oh, you will say anything not to have to move that pool.
B...

The pool...

You drain the water, you push it to the side.
It's...

The issue is the tree.
Yeah, but you think I don't know that?
I would love to have the tree down, but that's never gonna happen, because it belongs to Mrs. Hoost.
And I have talked to her a bunch of times.
She's a nightmare.
Maybe for you.
Y-You can be a little off-putting.

"Off-putting"?
Just because you're very beautiful.
And you're young.

You show up there, she sees you, she's an older lady.
She sees the skin.

What do I do?"
- Uh-huh.

- Uh-huh.

I can get permission from Mrs. Hoost right now.
[Chuckling] Oh!

Are you kidding me?

I dealt with it every day on the streets.
You start nice, you come in with a little honey.
If it doesn't work, you bring a little heat.
Okay, well, what is it that you like to eat when you've failed and you're depressed?
'Cause I'll just start making that now.
Oh, okay.

I'm gonna be very happy.
And you know what I like when I'm happy?

Boy, what a... what a lovely home you have.
I love the couch, the plastic.
It's like having a pool raft, but inside.
You could throw up on this, and 10 minutes later, you clean it up, you're back in the game.
I like it.

Ooh.

You have a lot of them.

[Clank] Ohh!
These guys are making biscuits.
Okay, I'm gonna put that down.
Anyway...
Uh...

And that said...

I don't think you did.
No.
It was an e-vite, you know?
You should check your spam folder for that.
Either way, you should come next year, 'cause it's gonna be off the chain.
I'm in bed at 8:30.
Make an exception next year, 'cause it's gonna be cray-cray.
You are a very boring man.
Okay.
I have an early flight to Florida in the morning.
You should go.
Ooh!

Nice, nice!
Laying out, catch some rays...

My sister died.
Still, you got to get some color for the wake, right?

Ooh!

I was thinking...

I could cut that down while you're gone, write up a receipt, and just charge you half.
That's all.

The tree is not dead.
- It's dead.

Not making plans for the spring.

The tree is not going anywhere.
Let me put it to you this way.
[Clears throat]
You want to know what I'm known for?
Giving honey and bringing the heat.
And guess what.

One call to the town, they'll declare that thing a hazard, and they'll rip it down themselves, and they'll foot you with the bill.
Or we can do it the easy way.

You wash my back, I wash yours.
I don't want you to wash me.
Wh...

Rutger!
Who's Rutger?

[Dutch accent] Is this man bothering you, Tante?
He wants to wash me.

No, no, no.

So good to see you again.

Yeah, they were like, [Mockingly] Hey, look at her.
Are you kidding me?

[Garbling]
- That is not okay!

Believe me, I didn't like it at all.
Oh, we are so taking that tree down!
I wish we could, all right?
It would be the perfect weekend, too, 'cause she's going to Florida, but...
'Cause then, they would come back, and they would know it's me.
Right.

I promised you I'd move that pool, and I will do it, okay?
Tomorrow.

All right, well, thank you, but, I mean, you can't do it tomorrow...

I still get credit for offering, though, right?
Honey, there's a big storm coming in.
You know what that means.
I don't have to come up with an excuse tomorrow?
No.

It's the perfect cover.
So, she goes to Florida, and we knock down the tree, and then we blame it on the storm.
I like it.
See, now I am happy!

And, you know, when I'm happy...
I didn't make fajitas.

I made you burgers.

Cool.

Okay, Dad, you cannot kill that tree.
It's a mercy kill, all right?
I mean, it's already half-dead.
And your mom and I, what we're doing, we're just...

Yeah, and if your father works the chainsaw right, tree's never gonna feel a thing.
Okay, no, I don't care about the tree, guys.
But there's a family of squirrels that live in it.
I mean, where will they go?
Are you kidding me?
No.

I like to watch them run back and forth.
All right, y-you do know that we tell people you're the smart kid?
What's that supposed to mean?
