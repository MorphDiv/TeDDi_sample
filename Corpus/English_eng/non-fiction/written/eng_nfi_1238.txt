Maybe me most of all.
It's hard not to be after all we've been through.
And so we retreat... forthefamiliar, placeswefeelsafest, behindthewallsofour righteous fortresses, butit'sallafairytale.
We're-- we're not safe... behind these walls... not in our own homes, not inside our own skin.
Because we have been deceived.

Now, Devil or not, evil is real, it exists.
It infects us, spreading hatred... and madness... anddeath.
And now, today's selection from the Holy Scriptures.
What shall enlighten us tonight?
Hmm?

How about the Psalms?

Or Ezekiel, who reminds us of God's sovereignty overallof hiscreation.

We have even gotten to... to God's promise to send a savior to protect us.
- Matthew...

Go out there, find the enemy,

SIMON:

She wanted to... especially after you were born.
She took my name.
She wanted you to have it.
But I always thought that was some kind of a bad omen.
I didn't want my stink rubbing off on you.
Suppose that makes it easier when you want to get up and go.
That's not what I wanted.
I figured if I wasn't around, maybe they would pass you by.
I thought that way about my family once.
Difference is, though, I checked in on mine.
Wanted to make sure my kid wasn't locked in a closet... beaten... hair pulled out by the root.
You know... that kind of thing.
I know you're upset with me, but we don't have time for a therapy session.
You know, after you left, now and then, I'd ask Mom about you.
"Where'd he go?"
"What kind of man was he?"
"Did you love him?"
(inhales)
"Is it my fault?"
(exhales)
She could only ever say two things.
"He left."
Now you're here.

You a cult leader here to watch the end of the world?
'Cause you sure act the fucking part.
The world doesn't have to end, son.
Did you tell them that?
Your chosen ones out there?
I think you're feeding them a line of shit.
And I think they're just some other family you got tired of.
(electrical crackling)
You feel that, don't you?
It makes the hair on your arm stand up like lightning's about to strike, and if you close your eyes, you can actually see it.
Those pinpricks of light dancing around in the dark.
Those are beacons... and they're coming... soon.
How do you know?
Because I told 'em.
How's that work?
We tend to gather around together, like water finding an ocean.
That's how a bunch of us ended up here.
Is that the way it was before?
With those eight beacons that I saw buried in the junkyard?
Go on, tell me you didn't do that.

You and your baby appear to be perfectly healthy.
Your oxygen levels were a little low, so I thought it best to start a prenatal program,

Would you like to see the sonogram?

Obstetrics weren't really my specialty.

That deranged midwife told me the opposite, but she was also convinced the baby was one of you.
Well, you can never really tell.
Stop fucking with my head!
I'm clean.

You just said we were both fine.
Truth is, I don't know any one of us that has ever carried a baby to term.
The body always seems to find a way to... expel it.

I will do everything in my power... to bring your baby into this world.
Thanks, but just give me my vitamins, and I'll just check in every few weeks.

We didn't ask you to massacre your council.
That was all you.

I didn't.
I haven't seen Sidney since the council meeting.

Well, he wasn't exactly... 100 percent.
Perhaps his nature just caught up with him.
Isn't that what your research is supposed to fix?
I have a few new test subjects that should prove very helpful.

To protect Kyle Barnes, because he could bring about the Merge.
So now it's your job to look after Mr. Barnes and his daughter, and his father.
Because what they can start, they can stop.

Get us all in one place and bring on the Merge.
Yes, but they're not expecting us to fight back.
I know what we can do.
I know who we are, we can push 'em back.
Now, once these sumbitches understand that they can't come back here, they're gonna leave us alone.
They'll die off and let us... go on living like normal human beings.
How do you know?
How do you know it'll work?
Because I've seen our power.
Thirty years ago... but it's dangerous.
Getting everybody together in one place like that.
Especially after what Helen did.
What did Helen do, exactly?
They hate what makes us human, son.
They hate everything about it... so she bored it out of 'em.

Removed their ability to feel...

She just left 'em there, sitting in their light.
When I showed up, the whole place felt electrified.
It was lifting me up, I could barely keep my feet on the ground.
It was happening.
Their Merge was happening... and I had to stop it.

Which one of 'em survived that night?
Kyle said he found eight bodies, but... there was nine.
