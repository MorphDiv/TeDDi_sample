[Mrs. Matlin grunts] Lights out.
What's wrong?
You worried about your university interview tomorrow?
It's SoCalArt.
They only accept, like, 40 people each year.
- What if I mess up?

But hey, maybe I'll move to Cali to be near you and your sister.
Hashtag, goals, right?
[chuckles] Okay.

- Now, get some rest, okay?

[reporter on recording] While no fatalities have been reported, a number of students are being rushed to hospital, at least one in critical condition.
[sirens wailing]
[indistinct chatter on video]
- [Mrs. Matlin] Good, you're up.

I'm turning it off. [Sighs]
[Mrs. Matlin] Get dressed and come get breakfast.
Breakfast?
And don't tell me a granola bar's enough.

- [Frankie grunts] - [Jonah] Okay.
- [grunts] Oh, ten points. [Chuckles] - [Frankie] Mmm. [Chuckles]
[Jonah] Yeah.

Yeah.

- I scored huge.

One more driving lesson, though?

Oh.

- Ha-ha.

So what you're saying is I shouldn't even have to take this test, right?
- Oh, you're the expert.

Frankie, I'd love to help, but...
I know, I know.

[laughs]
What's funny?
Oh, uh, it's just something Grace said.
Well, can I see it?
Uh, not without a warrant.
Uh, I got your warrant right here.
[chuckling]
Hey, what the hell, Frankie?
- [sighs]

Yeah, no, it's fine.
Wanna head in?
Yeah, sure.
[indistinct chatter]
Hello, my name is Rasha Zuabi, and I'm reading for the role of Hero.
You're auditioning for the lead?
Yes.

- [scoffs] I... [stutters]

By all means.
"I was waiting for you when I heard about the crash.
We were supposed to grab dinner."
[chuckling]
Um... [stutters] Should I stop?
No.

"But you never showed.
You were here, in this bed, three months and a day.
And every day, I've been here, talking to you.
But can you hear me?
Are you ever going to come back to me?"
Was that okay?

No, that was...

We'll be in touch.
[school bell ringing]
I can't wait for you to drive me everywhere.
California, here we come!
So now you don't like California?

Can boys and girls be just friends?
- No.

- That's helpful.

The last time she was just friends with a boy, Tiny fell in love with her.
Yeah.

But think of all the boys you're friends with.

They don't count, okay?
One's gay.

- Well, why doesn't Baaz count?

Okay.

Usually the boy.

Must have missed that chapter.
Jonah got a message from Grace, and when I tried to see it, he freaked.
Should I be worried?

Oh, my God.
Are they a good match?
Maya?
- Mmm?

- Did I...

Up late practicing for SoCalArt?
[Maya sighs]
Do you ever think about death?
As someone with a fatal genetic disease, yes, I do think about it. [Chuckles]
- Thanks for bringing it up.

Uh, can we talk?

I was up all night, and I saw a video of a girl our age getting hanged.
Why her?

[Grace] Because we're lucky we live here?
- [camera shutter clicking]

Jonah and I talked to student council the other day...
Hey, that creep just took a picture of us.
- [sighs] I'm trying to talk to you.

He just did it again.
Hey.
Creep.
[shouts in Arabic] [in English] Give it back.
You can't just take photos of people without...
Who are these people?
[stutters] Did you know them?

Douma.
Near Damascus.
[Maya] What happened?
[Saad] When they came, everyone was separated.
Men were shot. [Inhales deeply]
Women and girls were taken.
People were dying all around me.
People keep dying around me, too.
I guess we're the lucky ones.
At least that's what everybody keeps telling me.
I was nervous at first, but then the words just flowed out of me.
- [chuckles]

And the play is so beautiful.
It's about a girl named Hero, who has a boyfriend in a coma, and she's so worried that he'll never wake up.
But in the end, he does.
I'm pretty sure Hero is a boy.
In love with another boy?
They're gay.
Hero is based on Miles.
[scoffs]
That's why he laughed.
Does this mean I can't get the part?
It was a long shot, anyway.
There are only three roles in the play and a lot of people wanted to be in it.
[sighs] But why would he let me audition for the wrong role?
[Goldi sighs] [school bell ringing]
This is where I was supposed to meet my boyfriend, but he never showed up.
What happened to him?
He, um... [sighs]
He killed himself.

[shutter clicks]
Then my bandmate got in this texting-and-driving accident.
Then there was the bus crash.
[breath trembles]
[breathing heavily]
When I went to visit Tristan in the hospital... all I could think was that... he was there... because I exist.
How did he look after the crash?
He was...
We were upside down.

[grunts]
Hold your hair back.
Relax your hand.
[camera shutter clicks]
- [shutter clicks] - [cell phone vibrating]
Oh, crap!

[Maya sighs] [indistinct chatter and laughter]
[Frankie] Hey.
[stutters] Um, would you be able to hack into Jonah's messages for me?
Well, by court order, I have to say no.
But... if he's ever used our Wi-Fi at home, I have his password.
I installed a key logger at home when Mom was e-mailing my doctors.
- [chuckles]

Jonah's messages are private, though.
Yeah, Yael's right.
With great power comes great responsibility.
- You owe me.

For not eating you when we were in the womb.
Dark.

That earns you one password.
How would you feel if Jonah read through your private messages?
[chuckles] I'm just trying to make sure that he's not cheating on me, or lying, or totally in love with his best friend.
That's not how trust works.
Wait...
Have you read through my messages?
Of course not.

- [cell phone chimes]

[cell phone vibrates]
I trust Jonah.
[Yael] Well, then you have nothing to worry about, right?
- [piano playing] - [Maya] ♪ And you won't have to guess ♪
♪ If it's real and if it's right ♪
♪ Then we won't forget this night ♪
♪ When I'm ready to get close to you ♪
♪ I will, yes, I will, yes, I will ♪
♪ When the time is right I will let you know ♪
♪ How I feel ♪
♪ If this is real ♪
That was lovely.

Thanks.

I can see that.
Junior orchestra, several bands, and quite a bit of songwriting.
But not since last April?
Yeah.

I...

It... broke my wrists.
- Have you been writing about it?

I've just been a bit blocked lately.
At SoCalArt, you'll be expected to write through the writer's block.
Of course.

- [sighs] That won't be a problem.

You're... you're very talented, Maya, but to be a great songwriter, you have to keep writing.
Hmm.
[scoffs]
Immature?
- Ready for your driving exam?

Good.

[tires screech]
- Oh!

Is there any way I can start again?
Is Hero based on you?
I guess so.
- Therefore, Hero is a boy?

So you let me audition for a boy character?
Look, I didn't want to embarrass you.

I didn't escape the firing squads so I could be treated like an idiot.
Look, I was just trying to be nice.
You know what would have been nice?
Telling me so I could audition for the right role.
Okay, then do that.
- Do what?

The female lead.
We're doing another session today.
How am I supposed to learn a whole new set of lines by this afternoon?
Look, you said you didn't want to be treated differently.
You read his messages?
Okay.

"Yeah, I knew I shouldn't, but I had to know,"
and then I was like, "Do you really want to know?"
So then I really, I almost... [grunts] I almost didn't.
[sighs] But then I did.
And now I have to tell him, don't I?
Yeah, that'll go over well.
Well, how am I supposed to fix, you know, "immature"?
I mean, is it the way I dress?

- Is it the way I act?

When boys say "immature," they mean one thing.
[stutters] Are you actually considering it?
[groans] I don't know.
I've thought about it, but... [sighs]
I can't really do that, can I?
Well, if you have to ask, the answer is probably no.
When Jonah and I are together... we just kinda fit.
And I haven't really felt that with anyone else.
But... [inhales deeply] when are you together?
Isn't he always busy with the play?
I just need to convince him to take a little break.
[playing soft melody] [jarring chord]
[sighs] [cell phone vibrates]
[chuckles]
- Jonah!

Hey.
- Well, hello to you, too.

Are these tickets to the Anti-Flag show?
I mean, they're more of a gift for me, but, um... you can tag along.
- You like Anti-Flag?

- Do you not?

I never thought you liked anarchy so much, mayor's daughter.
Well, yeah.

I like different songs of... of theirs.
- [Jonah] Mmm.

[Jonah chuckles]
- We should go set up.

Frankie, I have play auditions tonight.
We'll talk later?
[sighs]
I'm never going to be Hope.

I wanted to be Hero
- because I relate to him.

I feel his pain.
So why shouldn't you get a boy part?
Rasha, you ready?
Yes. [Sighs]
I'm ready to audition for the role of Hero.
Look, we talked about this.
[stutters] Hero's based on my experiences, right?

But the feelings Hero has aren't exclusive to boys.
I haven't heard back from my best friend since I left Syria.
I'm not sure if she's okay, or hurt, or... [inhales sharply]
Shouldn't someone who deeply understands the material play the part?
All right.
You can audition again.
If you're right for it, we'll talk.
But if not, that's it.

Fair.
[ventilator hissing]
This is him.
[Saad] He looks peaceful.
I wanna look like that.
Ever since the crash...
I've felt numb.
And I thought if I just kept smiling, I'd feel better.
But I didn't... until I saw your photos.
They make me feel something and I just want to keep feeling.
That's why I need you to take more... with me.
Now.
We should do this before a nurse comes.
- I got it done in Syria.

I just thought, you know,
- why not have a change?

Uh...
He looks happy.

- [Zoë] Mmm.

Okay, he's almost here.

[Miles] Hey, Rasha?
Oh, hi, Miles.

So, I was thinking about what you said.
That someone who understands the material should play Hero.
Did you have someone in mind?
Yeah, actually.

Me.
Because no one understands what I'm going through better than me, right?
[smacks lips] No, I suppose not.
But I really liked your audition.
So you're going to be Coma Boy.
And don't worry, it does have lines.
So, rehearsal's at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.
Who actually, um, approves the rehearsal times?
- Oh, that's me!

You okay?
I'm in the play.
- I'm in the play.

My bad.

- I...

Do you wanna... grab coffee?
That'd be nice.
You're better off without him, okay?
I mean, what was he thinking with those Xs?
Tic-tac-toe hasn't been cool since grade five.
Can I have a minute?
[Jonah sighs]
Frankie...
I have been under a lot of pressure trying to figure out my future.
And with the... the play, it's... it's a really big deal for college applications.
I understand.
But I feel really lucky to have you.
You're my rock.
Even though sometimes I can be... immature?
Frankie, I like you exactly the way you are.
Forgive me?
- [chuckles] Of course.

Good, then... [sniffles]
What do you say we go get some ice cream for lunch?
I'd like that.

[Jonah] Good. 'Cause you're driving.
Gotta practice if you're gonna pass your next test.
- Can I meet you in your car?

Do you still have that condom?
[Lola sighs]
Thank you.
[cell phone ringing]
- Hey, Grace.

Oh, about the play.

I'm sorry.

That's... what I wanted to talk to you about.
You're off the hook.
What do you mean?
Me and Jonah are working on the play with Miles... instead of you?
Are we still cool?
[stutters] If... if you want, we can find you another job on it.
Um...
It's okay.
I think I found something else anyway.
See you at school. [somber music playing]
