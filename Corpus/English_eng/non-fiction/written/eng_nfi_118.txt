Previously on I'm Dying Up Here...
But I'm not an alcoholic.
Yeah, don't open with that.
Well, I did the one thing that no comic's ever done.
I got my shit together.
I could put together a group of women, make them pee their pants faster than bad Nielsen ratings.
You could call your special Girls Are Funny Too.
Edgar, Melvin and I served together.
Who's the cute blonde you got going up here?
Does the Texas Jew thing?
We agree to this, the project moves forward?
Green-lit.
You're in.
You told me that my act wasn't ready.
Who said anything about doing your act?
They want the girl from Wink.
Tell your face.
Guys, Vietnam's coming to an end.
That means what?
Comedians are coming home... from Canada.
I used to do a lot of handyman work, growing up.
Mostly because my dad was in the business... of breaking shit.
Well, what are you doing in here?
That hooker in the trunk ain't gonna bury herself.
All right, thank you, folks.
You've been a... slightly above average crowd.
Right this way.
Hi.
You have a nice day.
My uncle was the town drunk, which in Wink, Texas is an elected position.
I like it.
Uh, it's one of those rare positions where falling down on the job is actually a requirement.
Eh, I don't know about that.
I moved to Wink when I was ten after my parents died.
They went to Heaven, and we went to Wink.
I know, but some of this new stuff is really starting to play out there.
This is prime time.
Your parents are out at a hootenanny, making music blowing through a jug.
All right.
Well, what if I just maim 'em?
Building a relationship with a network audience is it's... it's like building any relationship.
You lead with your best behavior before you shit on their heads.
You stick with the Texas twang, the wide-eyed innocence and... dating relatives with funny names.
Well, I haven't used Lum yet.
You are a comedy gold mine, Daisy Mae.
Thank you kindly, ma'am.
There you go!
Got my 30-day chip today.
Thirty days without alcohol.
Uh, I also got my "130 days without sex" chip.
Yeah.
That was more of a scar than a chip.
I mean, if it hadn't been for a hand job
I got just for shutting up, we could be talking about well over a year here.
But, I mean, if you think I got a drinking problem, you should see the women that agree to have sex with me.
They are basically just vaginas floating in vodka.
Uh, this next guy...
He's done some pretty unforgivable shit.
Let's give a big Try God welcome to Terry.
Terry, everybody.
Keep coming back.
Hi, Terry.
Jesus Christ!
There's a lot of chatter about you in here, huh?
The booths are full of suits.
Your next comedian coming to the stage is a very funny guy.
Formerly a very funny doorman here at Goldie's.
Big round of applause for Joey Spencer!
Are you fucking kidding me?
All right, thanks.
Manny Martinez, everybody, keep it going for him.
It's okay, he's the one Mexican here who's not trying to steal your job...
Joey Spencer, ladies and gentlemen, huh?
Let's keep it going.
I'm Mike Lovis, and I've been working the door here at Goldie's a lot longer than him.
Ain't that right, shit-stain?
Sounds like a yes to me.
So I'm in the grocery store the other day and I see a
So I do what any person would do in that kind of situation.
I start counting how many items she has in... her... fucking cart.
No, no, no.
So I'm all like, "Twelve, 13..."
She had 17 fucking items in her cart!
And I've been up in The Cellar one time!
And Joey gets the fucking Main Stage!
Fucking bullshit!
Keep it going for Joey Spencer.
Sorry, everybody.
Um...
So I was out with this girl the other night.
Ah!
What the hell's going on in here?
Lovis flipped out.
Must be some kind of doorman syndrome.
How 'bout those gas prices, huh?
What's the deal with that, huh?
No... no, no!
Nixon was...
Yeah, yeah, no, I-I just didn't know that you knew it.
It was great catching up with you.
Now grab the fucking door.
Three years, three years I worked that fucking door!
Yes, ma'am.
Now get your fucking ass out!
Arnie.
Goldie told me to watch the door.
She knows my name.
Ooh, stirring.
You watching the door, you need a T-shirt.
What size are you?
Medium.
Oh, we only have smalls.
Why the fuck did you ask?
It's called common courtesy, douchebag.
All right.
Give Ron a large shirt.
That is the weirdest sex ever, the weirdest sex, okay?
Now, ladies, I don't want y'all to take this the wrong way, but y'all are fucking crazy.
Always trying to figure us men out.
You think I'm playing?
When JFK got shot, his wife jumped on the trunk of the car and grabbed his brains.
Even when we dead, y'all wanna know what we thinking.
Cuban missile crisis?
Not interested.
Marilyn.
That bitch.
I knew you was in here somewhere.
You're in some shit when we get to the house.
I'm from Boston originally.
Uh, my father owned a men's shop.
One of the great rivalries in professional sports.
Uh, my father, he hated the Yankees.
You know?
The-the thing my father detests most, in order, are the Yankees, the Nazis, and ill-fitting suits.
Um, my father's very critical of-of how people dressed.
In fact, when we go to see the Sox play the Yankees at Fenway Park, my father would often direct his insults at how the Yankees players looked in their uniforms rather than the players themselves.
Hey, Mantle!
Mantle!
You look like shit out there!
A well-fitted shoulder should lie flat and be the same length as the bone und...
Thank you.
A well-fitted shoulder should lie flat and be the same length as the bone under it!
And should meet the sleeve of the uniform right where your arm meets your shoulder!
Ya bum!
Pick up.
You've been a very well-behaved audience.
Hey, would you guys like some refills, or...
All right.
Okay.
Funny stuff.
Uh, yeah, doing my best.
Kenny Vesey.
Uh, hey.
Eddie Zeidel.
Wait, are you, uh, are you Kenny In The AM?
Kenny!
I-I listen to you all the time since I've, uh, since I've been here from Boston.
I'm gonna fight every instinct I have and still leave you a decent tip.
Well, my hand-to-mouth existence thanks you.
No, seriously, man, uh...
It was so funny.
Jesus, I've known Bobby since our New York days.
Yeah, we did, uh, did a lot of coffee shops together.
Funny shit.
Especially the closer.
"Closer," huh?
More like segue to pouring coffee.
Well, keep at it.
Maybe one day soon we'll have you on.
Thanks for Babe Ruth.
And thank you for No No Nanette.
I can't tell you how anxious CMA is to get into the Nick Beverly business, huh?
Seriously.
Yeah, I'm more of a, uh, mom and pop operation right now than a business.
We launch careers, Nick.
Look, as a side note, uh,
Yeah, not much of a coke man, but a lovely gesture nonetheless.
Cool.
Just know, late or loaded,
CMA has got your back, Nick.
Seriously.
Late and loaded, I got.
So why don't we go with rich and famous, huh?
Speaking my language.
Your wish is my command.
Hey, I'm gonna hit the road early.
7 a.m. sharp.
You hear me?
Yeah. 7 a.m. sharp.
So that means, what, you'll be ready by 8?
Yeah, baby, four sold-out shows in Vegas.
Oh.
It's like a boring white people convention.
Yeah, but I'm gonna be yawning all the way to the bank at a grand a gig to open for those two.
Well, Edgar already wormed his way into driving.
I didn't worm my way into driving, okay?
That's like saying somebody wormed their way into painting your apartment.
Comped room at Caesar's?
All the food and drink you can handle?
You a motherfucking worm, and you know it.
It's a little wormy.
First of all, if you go anyway, which bed you gonna sleep in?
Mine or Edgar's?
Oh, hey.
Here's a funny prick you want to know.
Bill Hobbs, Miles Farber, CMA.
Seriously.
Yeah, we've already met.
When you passed on repping me.
Uh, yeah, sorry,
I usually don't forget a face.
No, please, forget this one.
That way, a year from now after I've been on Carson and you come crawling back to suck my cock,
I can tell you to go fuck yourself.
Seriously.
I did say prick.
You know, Goldie,
I've always liked your club.
Something about it reminds me of my daddy's place.
Yeah, all the talent that's come through here.
Only instead of, uh, Coleman Hawkins and Thelonious Monk, now it's Richard and Carlin.
Different music, but same energy.
I'm just wondering, is it wise you hiding him in your cellar is all?
Carl is a good manager.
And he was taking care of that kid.
Till you whispered in his ear.
Nobody's casting aspersions.
Boy made his own decisions.
Yeah?
So what are you to him now?
A friend.
No financial entanglements.
Just seems obvious, so much talent.
And look, when you got a van Gogh, you don't hang it in the cellar.
It's my van Gogh.
I'll hang it wherever the fuck I want.
Look, Barton, I'm sure you're a hell of a pimp, but don't ever come into my club and tell me how to handle my kids.
Stick to what you know...
Racketeering and getting Pryor laid.
Don't fool yourself, Goldie.
We're both pimps.
Only my whores get paid.
So I've been making the amend rounds lately.
Uh, it's been about eight weeks, and I'm up to the Cs now.
Don't you feel bad pretending to be an alcoholic just to work on your material?
Are you kidding?
It's like one country song after another in there.
Trust me, I'm providing much-needed comic relief.
Besides I gotta up my game now that I'm a door guy.
I mean, Goldie gives those guys special treatment.
They get to pick their own spots at open-mic night, so she's bound to see me.
Hold for the amazing lack of self-awareness.
A year from now when me and Johnny are playing golf together,
I want you to think back on this moment when you wonder why I never ask you to caddie.
All right, thanks for that call, Sharon.
Now, you heard her, folks.
If you like funnel cakes, if you like petting zoos, you are running out of time!
This is the final weekend, so head on over to that
L.A. County Fair!
Stay tuned, everybody this is Kenny in the AM.
All right, Kenny Vesey, everybody, and we're talking to Nick Beverly on Kenny in the AM!
Man, biscuit!
Now, I don't know how many of you caught it, but Nick was on The Tonight Show.
It was incredible.
How bad was Ed's breath?
Because when I was on, he could have knocked a buzzard off a wagon!
It was so bad...
Yeah, I can't say I got that close, but Johnny smelled delightful.
I'd like to find a car freshener that smells just like Johnny.
I'm just not totally sold.
Are you a fuckin' idiot?
Doorman's a plumb gig.
How much money you make is totally up to you.
It's all a big hustle, Ronnie.
Hey, what's this "Ronnie" shit?
All right, here's the deal, "Ronnie."
Main room has three levels, 'kay?
Up front, that's your target range for comics doing crowd work.
Ideally you want to sit hot chicks, old guys with hot chicks, and homosexuals.
And how will I know they're homosexuals?
You know, homo behavior.
Giggling, white wine.
Manners.
The back is noisy and it has poor sight lines, so that's strictly for the rabble.
So the prime seating is the booths?
Oh, yeah, that's where you're gonna make most of your bread.
Say some high roller comes in asking about a booth, you say, "Sorry, pal.
These booths are reserved for Presidents Lincoln,
Hamilton, and Jackson."
Hamilton was not a president.
He was the country's first Secretary of the Treasury, and he also helped found the Federalist Party.
Well, cock-a-doodle- who-gives-a-fuck?
Anyway,
I'm doorman supervisor, so I get 20 percent of your take.
Are you shitting me?
Eh, you'll still make plenty.
Not right now, later now.
When I'm dressed.
All right, we're back everybody.
Kenny Vesey, we're talking to Nick Beverly about Dodger fans...
Ooh, Nick's on.
Only tension during the game is when it's all tied up in the middle of the seventh and they can't find their cars in the parking lot.
You know Kenny Vesey caught my act at the deli last night?
I got to tell you something, pal.
I used to go to a lot of Yankees-Sox games.
And my uncle, who was a tailor, all his insults about the Sox used to be about how their clothes fit.
Hey, Ted Williams!
A well-fitted shoulder lies flat and should meet the sleeve of your uniform right where your arm meets your shoulder!
Ya bum!
That's your joke.
I wouldn't be bragging.
I'm gonna tell you how the term...
That motherfucker.
What... what is all this?
Goldie Herschlag, exec producing CBS comedy special.
Finally, news that's fit to print.
Where's the Dom?
Uh-uh-uh.
There's a story.
Well, I hope it's a story about champagne.
Years ago, before I had a dime,
I toasted my very first deal with a bottle of this fine Boone's Farm Apple Wine.
Ever tasted as good.
Come here.
Mmm.
That is yummy.
This is big.
Are you kid...
As your lawyer, I'm telling you, this is very big.
And don't worry about the Dom, there'll be plenty of that tomorrow night at the Dansaks' party.
Good, because this is awful.
You know, uh, Camille's gonna be there, so...
To our baby.
Ohh...
Mmm.
Hey.
I thought you was moving furniture.
Yeah.
For my people, beanbag chairs are furniture.
Hey.
Getting in the zone.
What kind of black dude are you?
Look, Sonny and Cher have done me a solid.
I'm opening for the biggest audience I've ever played for all because they believe in me.
So forgive me if I don't share your ire.
"Ire"?
I repeat, what kind of black dude are you?
The kind that's trying to build a motherfucking career and take care of his own rather than trying to fix a motherfucking world that don't give a shit.
Why does everybody think every black comic gotta be all in your face about how black they are?
Can't shit just be funny?
You see, now that sounded black.
Two octaves higher, I'd pull over the van so you could hold up a liquor store.
You'd like that.
The revolution will be televised, and I'm hosting that motherfucker.
Yeah?
I got a scoop you won't find in the trades.
Oh, for fuck's sake, Arnie, does everything with you come with a drum roll?
I-I just talked to our liquor guy.
He's gonna have one less stop to make on his route.
Teddy's.
Cut off.
Three months late on his fucking liquor bill.
Ooh, I like the way this day is shaping up.
Now this is what I call music.
Oh, shit.
Just... eh-be cool.
I'm cool.
Don't worry, I'm gonna take care of everything.
Okay, you do that.
You acting jittery as shit.
Just shut up.
Be cool.
Y-you sure?
Hello, Officer.
License and registration.
Um...
Well, I left it in the van.
I'll just get it.
What the fuck?
What the fuck was that?
I panicked.
Now I'm gonna get screwed over because you panicked over a couple of fucking joints?
We've intercepted a vehicle with two beanbag chairs stuffed with over 5,000 hits of THC, copy?
Copy, 166.
Now is the time you should start motherfucking panicking.
Oh, when do I get to meet Silverman?
Oh, you know Fred really wanted to be here, but he had to give a speech at some, uh, some animal rights event.
He couldn't switch it around, so...
And have you met my wife, Lisa?
Lisa, honey, come here, come here.
This is Goldie.
Oh, it's nice to meet you.
Everybody, if I could have your attention please?
One of our honored guests tonight, Eli Gershman, his beautiful wife, Camille, would like to say a few words, so please.
Camille?
Thank you.
In 1961, our oldest, Christopher, was born.
We wanted to welcome him into the world toasting him with champagne.
The only problem was we were flat broke after setting up Eli's practice.
Fortunately for us, that was the year this delightful little vintage came out.
Boone's Farm Apple Wine.
So now, when good things happen, we remember back to when love and a buck a bottle were more than enough.
Aww.
To my darling husband, Eli, our three wonderful children, and Eli's formidable partner, Goldie.
Oh..
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Delightful, just delightful.
Everybody, let's eat.
Look, the story with the wine was true.
All right, and I wanted to share it with you.
I'm not an idiot, Eli.
I know what we have is a lie.
But what makes it tenable:
we don't lie to each other.
Otherwise, I don't know what the fuck we're doing.
[Ticket's "Bad Things in the World
How do you know
Ah, sweet mystery of life.
The comedy world just got smaller.
You retiring?
Ooh, that's a good one.
So what happened?
King Theodore's done.
Cut off by his liquor supplier.
Mm, no shit.
Did you hear about King Theodore's?
Hey, Cass.
I read about "Vagina Nights" in the trades.
I can't tell you how happy I am for you.
Wow, guys, overwhelmed with the support, thank you.
Cassie, you were in the trades?
Yeah and Girls Are Funny Too is announced.
It's, uh, it's actually happening.
Christ, why can't they do a guy's version?
They do; it's called the fucking Tonight Show.
Amen to that.
Amen to what?
Girls Are Funny Too is basically the Negro League with tits.
Funny is funny... that should be the sole determining factor.
But, hey, if you want to be a second-class comedian, then be my guest.
So if there was a "Jews Are Funny Too" special,
What, if there were a "Black Guys Are Funny Too" special or a "Guys With Glasses Are Funny Too" special or a
"Guys Who Smell Faintly Like Urine Are Funny Too" special, you wouldn't jump at it?
It's a good thing he said "faintly."
Man, biscuit!
Yeah, I'll be there, man.
All right, good, you could do the call-ins with me.
I'm sorry, who are you?
Oh, I'm the fucking waiter who told that joke at the deli yesterday, the one you stole and said on your radio show this morning.
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
You know what you did.
Kenny Vesey.
He's the youngest comic to do Carson.
Carson.
Why the fuck would he steal your open mic joke?
I'm not sure, why don't you ask him?
Come on, man.
I mean, who'd want to pick corn out of that pile of shit?
Let's go
Yeah, not with this jerk-off here.
Fucking nerve on this little kid.
Ignore him, man, he's an arrogant little asshole.
What do you call a Mexican hitchhiking?
Stranded.
This next guy needs no introduction.
Fitzy, ladies and gentlemen.
Uh, if anybody wants an autograph, he'll be outside vomiting up cocktail onions after the show.
So my mother's a big woman.
Yeah, just-just not a fan of exercise.
Little bit of a drinking problem too.
I-I, actually, I tried to get her to go to AA, but she refused when she heard it had 12 steps.
She-she is really, really heavy.
She told me when she dies, she wants to be cremated so her ashes can be used to blot out the sun.
No, I mean, I love my mother, but, you know, she's...
She, uh... she-she is, uh, she-she's just a big lady.
You know, she-she just-she- you know, she won't exercise.
But I already said that.
Sorry, um...
What, uh, what-what else-what...
Um... oh, yeah, so, uh, so my name-my name is, uh, my name's Ron Shack, which, you know, Fitzy kind of failed to mention.
Uh, hi.
Uh, Ron is, uh, my nickname.
It's-it's, uh, it's actually short for "Moron."
'Cause, uh... uh, 'cause...
Uh...
You know, people assumed it'd be short for...
Technical problems.
Uh...
Anybody got an instruction manual?
Nope?
He bombed three times at once.
We're bringing in a firing squad and they'll put you out of your misery.
Just be honest.
Like-like scale of one to ten, how bad was that?
Uhh, well, what you want to hear is that you did okay.
But what you need to hear is that you sucked.
Which you did.
But that's good, that's how you get better.
Hey, hey, look at the bright side.
You know, after that performance, short of one of "Jerry's kids" coming up on stage and popping a crutch, you're a lock for a pity fuck.
I panicked.
I saw Goldie watching, and I just froze.
It-it-it-it was like one of those-those horror movies where you try to scream and-and nothing comes out.
It's okay, Ronnie.
It's not that big a deal.
Yeah, tell that to Lovis.
Now, look here, Norton has style.
He shoots that jab right from his hip.
Then he move all herky-jerky.
Ali gonna have trouble timing that boy.
Well, speaking of young, pretty, and black.
All right, baby.
From Sonja.
Hey, y'all should have seen this man the other night.
Man, he had the audience bent with laughter.
I just had a good set, that's all.
Hey, never underestimate the power of charisma.
And that is something that you have tenfold.
No matter what Goldie may think.
And she could stick you in the bottom of the well, you'd still come up with laughs.
Meaning?
Means she's burying you in that bullshit cellar.
Hey, man, the Cellar's just somewhere to hone my style until it's ready for Main Stage.
Y'all hear this?
The fuck is so funny?
You wanna buy that jive.
But if you want to bury your light under a bushel and keep playin' house nigga to Miss Goldie, that's your call.
Man, why you always gotta talk shit to make a point?
I'm sorry, Adam, but I don't decorate the truth with ribbons and bows.
Try this shit on.
If you want to make it in comedy, it's only one place to do that in L.A., and that's Goldie's.
You sound like you done found Jesus.
Maybe I have.
There are other clubs, just like there are other ways.
Like what?
King Theodore's?
Man can't even pay his liquor bill.
And what does it matter?
Ain't nobody being found there anyways.
I gotta go.
Dating was different after guys found out my parents were dead.
They became afraid to use the word "parents."
I'd meet a guy's mother and father and he'd introduce them to me as,
"the couple who did his laundry."
It's funny.
Goldie wants my parents still breathing, it being network and all.
Mm, I get that.
So can you save it?
I mean,
Cass, this is your life.
I can be a sounding board and all, but this is-this is all you.
Yeah, but the stuff she wants me to say isn't my life.
It's like a cartoon version of my life.
Right.
God, I'm so sick of my stomach being in knots.
And it's just jokes, right?
Think Henny Youngman pulls his hair out every time he picks up his fiddle?
Yeah, probably.
I mean, "take my wife... please"
came from someplace.
Henny's wife probably shit herself laughing when she first heard it.
My dad was always disappointed that I didn't play baseball as a kid.
Harmon Killebrew and Sandy Koufax, they were heroes in our house.
Jews that could throw the ball, that was a very big deal.
Hey, you know who you're talking to, right?
Anyway, I, um...
I got bullied a lot as a kid.
So I was never fully comfortable around jocks holding bats.
And there was this one day
I was at Fenway with my old man, about ten years old.
And it was the bottom of the seventh, and he was extra surly 'cause the Sox were getting creamed by the fucking Yankees no less.
And he just keeps getting madder and madder.
And so I look at him and I say, "Hey, Dad.
What do you call a New Yorker with a baseball bat who's covered in baggy pinstripes?
A piece of shit."
Admittedly, it's not my A material, but... it's still my favorite.
And why is that?
'Cause it was the first time I ever made my old man laugh.
Yeah.
Jokes are sacrosanct because they're never just jokes, you know?
You are always in there somewhere.
Ooh.
You are one serious fucker.
Oh, that's nothin'.
Wait till you hear my dissertation on knock-knock jokes.
Oh, yeah?
Eh, fuck it, don't answer, what's the point?
Life has no intrinsic meaning or value.
I'm sorry I bothered you.
You always make me laugh.
Well, it's my burden.
You're a good friend, Eddie.
Yeah, you too.
Roger Moore is 002 at best.
What's that?
Care package?
From my mom.
Stuff from back home you can't get out here.
You eat this?
Mix it with peanut butter, it's called a "fluffernutter."
You okay, Ronnie?
You seem a little...
Down?
Pussy-ish.
Thanks, Maggie.
Seriously.
You should work with children.
Is this still about last night?
Maggie, I didn't just bomb.
I bombed in front of fucking Goldie, the one fucking person that you can't bomb in front of!
Whoa, whoa, take it down a notch.
I'm not the one who sucked last night.
You know what, Mags?
Fuck you.
You know what else?
Why don't you wear some fucking pants to breakfast like a normal person, okay?
'Cause we get it.
You have a vagina.
Really?
Hey, you get through to Sonny Bueno?
They're at rehearsal.
Sorry, man.
I truly envy that.
What's it like, Edgar?
Being so wrapped up in yourself that you don't give a fuck about anybody else?
I care about people.
Who do you give a motherfucking two shits about other than yourself?
I care about my friends.
What friends?
You don't have any fucking friends.
Ralph,
I fucked up, okay?
But that does not mean I don't care about people.
You know what we used to call motherfuckers like you in the army?
"Jack."
That's a special term of contempt reserved for those who only look out for themselves and not their mates.
That's you, Edgar.
A Jack motherfucker, through and through.
Ralph.
I am so fucking sorry, man.
Both of you!
It's all right, Officer.
Think it's a Vietnam thing.
You tour there?
Twice.
Who you with?
75th Infantry Rangers.
Sergeant Major Ralph Carnegie, Company C.
Sergeant Jerry Barnsdale.
Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol.
Find 'em, track 'em, kill 'em.
What happened here, Sergeant?
Wrong place, wrong time, wrong person to get a fucking ride from.
He's right, Officer.
He did not have anything to do with this, okay?
He's a comedian; he's gonna open for Sonny and Cher.
He barely drinks alcohol.
How'd you pull that off?
Anyone ever tell you you're a real piece of shit?
We haven't processed you yet.
If you were released now, it's like it never happened.
You serious?
I mean, I can make my gig.
This offer doesn't extend to him.
I'm good with that.
Ralph, Ralph.
It was me bringing up your Vietnam shit that got you out of here.
Come on, you gotta...
You gotta get somebody, Ralph.
Don't leave me in here.
Ralph, please, come on, Ralph.
You're on your own, Jack.
Buy you a drink, sailor?
Seriously, again?
What are you talking about?
I don't know if someone told you that I'm dying or something, but save your good works.
It's a fucking beer, Bill.
And the agent the other night?
I was throwing you a bone.
You think I need you to throw me a bone?
Did you come out of the womb an asshole?
Go fuck yourself.
Jesus, no wonder Cassie dumped your ass.
Oh, you pussy, I barely touched you.
Jesus Christ, Nick.
Oh, fuck, not now.
Come on.
Anyway, days blurred when I was drinkin'.
Holidays, birthdays.
Now that I'm sober, they're all too clear.
It sure was a lot easier to face your day when you weren't sure what day it was you were facing'.
Hi, uh, my name's Ron and I, uh...
My name is Ron and I-I-I'm not an alcoholic.
Uh, believe me,
I wish I was because then at least I could point to something I was successful at.
Here's some rigorous honesty.
I have been coming here to work on my stand-up comedy.
I've been using all you as guinea pigs while I stand up here and make up stories...
It's fucking pathetic.
I have no idea what it is
I'm-I'm doing anymore.
Wait, Ron.
What?
You sure that's all you wanted to share?
I'm really sorry.
No, no.
What I mean is maybe you need to be here.
So why not use this room as it was intended, a place to share your truth?
My truth.
Um...
I was this overweight dork.
And, I mean, I had some friends, but
I was never what you'd describe as "popular."
And I guess I've always kind of thought if I could be this, uh, this other thing, like this-this better, funny thing, uh, that-that people would treat me different, you-you know, be nicer or whatever.
And people-people would see you as that thing.
You know, instead of this thing.
Um...
But now I know that there is no other thing.
And it scares the shit out of me.
You know, just knowing that this...
This identity that I banked on giving my life its meaning was bullshit.
It's all bullshit.
And all that's left is me.
That's all.
You still clap.
Thank you.
House of Pies is way better than this shit.
You're not even eating the crust.
The crust is the best part.
Because I don't like to eat shit.
This is the only reason I come back to Los Angeles.
Can you just relax?
I'm overreacting?
Come on.
Where's... hey.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
Don't worry about it.
And a little for Nicky.
Whoops.
Hey, look, I'm sorry about what I said about, uh,
Cassie dumping you.
Yeah, I'm sorry that you got the world by the balls, but you're too much of a fuck-up to cash in.
Wow.
Just so you know, that is not how you get in my pants.
No?
Man,
What?
What are you so fucking pissed off about?
You really resent my success that much?
Your success?
Maybe I just don't think you're funny.
Look, I'm so much fucking funnier than you.
And you just so happen to be better than me at being in the right place at the right time.
They ran long.
Fuckin' Joan Embery.
What's that tell ya?
Carson would rather have a three-toed sloth piss all over his jacket then spend ten seconds chatting with you.
You really think you're funnier than me?
The fucking Zapruder film is funnier than you, Nick.
'Cause I always thought the beginning kind of meandered.
Excuse me, uh, Doris?
Would you solve something for us?
If we both tell you a joke, will you let us know who's funniest?
Who's paying?
He is.
She's the funniest.
Yeah.
Oh.
I told you I got a new tranny for my car.
Yeah, I didn't know they were putting them on the outside now.
You looking for a date?
Oh-ho, I'm all set, but thank you, Scrotum O'Neil.
Ooh, two for two, baby.
Oh, you want a date, Red?
I would not get involved with another woman whose cock is bigger than mine.
I'd just buy a ticket to a Loggins and Messina concert.
Yeah, I do want to take you out on a date.
Me, you, and a quiet table at the Hollywood free clinic.
I mean, I thought that was funny.
Hey, if it's a loveless fuck you're looking for, maybe it's time you finally call your father back.
That's your daddy he's talking about.
Yeah, we know we're both funny, but who's funnier?
Well, shit, junkie's the funniest, I guess.
And fuck you, motherfucker.
It's abscessed... it's comin' through your shirt.
Oh, oh, I'm sorry to give away your secret.
Let your bitch-ass friend go.
I'll cut his motherfucking junkie throat.
Hey, hey, get in the fucking car.
Enjoy the repercussions of your life decisions.
The truth is you're both some unfunny, sorry-ass faggots.
That's the damn truth, bitch.
Why don't you go suck off the rest of The Supremes?
Yeah, any fuckin' time!
I, for one, am okay with women breastfeeding in public.
As long as they're okay with me watching.
Speaking of watching...
Man, I could get used to having this many people here.
You deserve it.
Your stuff's great.
You're gonna kill.
Thank you.
For what?
Oh, for being such a nice guy.
Ladies and gentlemen, the lovely Cassie Feder.
You ever think that maybe I'm not that nice a guy?
Not for a second.
Whoo!
Gabe Schwartz, ladies and gentlemen.
So I'm sure you can tell where I'm from.
You're bleeding again.
You want me to take you to that emergency room or should we get ice cream this time?
I'm good.
You know, that shit turned Lenny Bruce into a strung-out court stenographer.
Not that I'm comparing you in any way, shape, or form to Lenny.
Can't all be Soupy Sales, Bill.
It's a fucking crutch.
You don't need it.
Pain is essential, and you know it.
All we are is agony as art.
Who the fuck talks like that?
Really?
Nobody gives a fuck about the depths of your soul.
It's about funny.
It's about money, fame, and getting laid by women way out of our league.
Spoken like a true hack.
Well, so what?
I'm supposed to be like you and Clay?
Shooting fucking heroin and then jump in front of a bus just as the spotlight hits?
You don't deserve any of the good that's falling into your aggressively untalented lap.
Wait, what are you talking about?
Clay was an accident.
Don't be a fucking idiot, Nick.
Clay walked against the light and jumped in front of a speeding bus.
People saw it.
You're a fucking cunt, Nick.
A real asshole.
Which probably means we'll be friends for life.
So wake the fuck up.
Be funny.
Not everyone cares about the darkness that keeps you up at night.
Thank you.
Keep it going, ladies and gentlemen.
Get the fuck out of the way...
More demand for the Cellar tonight than there is for the main room.
You are gonna get me in so much trouble with the fire marshal.
Spending more time killing it in the Cellar than Norman Bates.
This next kid, he's like a Raisin in the Sun to me.
Give it up for Adam Proteau, give it up, everybody.
Come on, Adam.
Whoo!
Six, though, six?
We saw six Ping-Pong balls come out of her vagina.
The seventh one came out of her asshole.
I'm serious.
Hey.
What the fuck was that, huh?
Hey, hey, what the hell was that for, huh?
He stole my joke!
He didn't steal your shitty joke, that's in your head.
You're the last person who knows what's in my fucking head, okay?
You think you're some great mystery, kid, huh?
You think I don't know you're trying to fuck Cassie?
Hey, hey.
Oh, shit.
Hey, enough, enough.
I didn't know he's moving on your girlfriend, Bill.
I'm glad I stole your shitty little joke!
Fuck.
What?
Fuck him, man.
Only scum tries to steal another guy's girl.
But you did steal his joke?
Yeah, it wasn't even that good of a joke, man.
Some stupid fucking baseball thing.
Oh!
Hey, you don't steal another guy's fucking joke, asshole.
Ow, Nick!
Where you going, huh?
Billy, Billy...
So, uh, who we kicking?
Are you okay?
We're not friends.
That's what happened.
You okay?
Maggie, as it stands right now, any more warmth and kindness from you, and I might slit my wrists, so...
I shouldn't have blown up on ya.
I'm sorry, Ronnie, I was a bitch.
And I promise from now on
I will always wear pants at breakfast.
Please don't.
Breakfast is only the most important meal of the day 'cause you show up to it pants-less.
Mmm.
Actually looks kind of yummy.
Interesting.
My mom always used to make 'em for me when I'd have a bad day.
Mm, for me it was grape ZaRex.
Forget what?
I don't know.
Everything.
Don't let the shit get you down, Ronnie.
You gotta ease up, okay?
As my dad used to say,
"Good things happen when you lighten your grip."
Obviously he wasn't masturbating when he said that.
No.
Hey, hey, hey.
You might want to wheel that delivery back out of here.
Unless it's Christmas.
Uh, is this King Theodore's?
Yeah, you got the right place, but, uh, I, uh,
I can't afford to pay you right now, hoss.
Who the fuck is Barton Royce?
