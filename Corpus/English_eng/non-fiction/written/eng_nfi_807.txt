Previously on When Calls the Heart...
As soon as you fire, we'll take the wagon.
You sure you want them dead?
I can't afford to take time off.
Phillip only gets one childhood, and you don't get to go back and do it over.
How are you getting on with Madame Mayor?
Perhaps we'd find it easier dealing with a more reasonable man.
Perhaps.
Has anyone applied to be the new cook yet?
No, not yet, but I hope it happens soon.
We are busier than ever.
I know exactly what you mean.
Just when I thought
I had enough supplies for all of our students, suddenly, a new bunch of kids shows up.
We'll figure something out.
I heard you made a deal with the railroad.
I did what I thought was right.
Abigail, I don't like to second guess people, but...
But that's exactly what you're going to do.
I just don't see how letting the railroad pay less than their fair share of taxes is good for Hope Valley...
Elizabeth, with all due respect, you don't have to understand.
That is my job.
Sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
The budget is not the only thing stretched to its breaking point.
I know you're under a lot of pressure.
Jack promised to walk me to school.
Can we talk about this another time?
Maybe when someone else is mayor.
Whoa, slow down there, young man.
Did you brush your teeth?
Yes, ma'am.
Hmm, you didn't just get the toothbrush wet like last time, did you?
Ah, good.
Do you think Pastor Frank would like to play dominoes tonight?
It'll be just us for dinner.
But we have spaghetti night with Pastor Frank every week.
I know we do.
Are you mad at each other?
Cody, it's hard to explain.
But we are going to have a great time tonight, I promise.
I have a special dessert planned.
Okay, off to school, you don't want to be late.
I think, if you don't mind,
I'd like to move dinner till a little later tonight.
Anything I can help with?
Only if you like grading math tests.
Hmm, I think I'll leave that to you.
So how's 7:00?
I'm making a pot roast.
Sounds adventurous.
I've made pot roast before.
Once.
And it was unbelievable.
Constable Jack Thornton?
Didn't I teach you better than that?
Uh... would someone here like to explain?
Elizabeth Thatcher, I want you to meet
Constable Douglas Burke.
All thanks to you.
I don't understand.
Get in line.
Why did you just try to hit him?
It was long overdue.
Doug was one of the junior cadets
I mentored at the academy.
We used to play practical jokes on each other.
That's only partly right.
Jack outranked me, so he got to play the jokes.
I had to suffer them, in silence.
So, what prank was that for?
Choose one.
Regimental Review Day.
A quart of goat milk in your boots.
Took me two weeks to get rid of that smell.
Boys will be boys.
Yeah.
Well...
Don't let me stand in the way.
It was nice to meet you.
Miss.
How'd you get so lucky?
I honestly have no idea.
So, what are you doing here anyway?
Superintendent Collins offered me the position that you turned down.
He did?
I'm leading a squad of Mounties up to the Northern Territories.
Well, I'm proud of you, Doug.
Thanks, Jack.
We're bunking at the saloon for the night.
I was hoping you'd have some time to catch up.
Of course.
Come on, let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Good morning, everyone!
Good morning, good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning, Philip.
I'm so glad you made it to the carnival.
I know it was important to him.
He's still struggling a little to keep up.
Maybe you could read to him.
It helps, and it'll give you a chance to spend some time with him.
I'm doing the best I can, Miss Thatcher.
All right, everyone, let's get settled.
Now, we have a very fun project that we'll be starting today.
Can Brownie be part of it?
Of course.
Everyone in your family will be a part of it.
This week, you're each going to be making a family tree.
What's that?
It's an exercise where you trace the history of your relatives back as far as you can go, and then you share that information with the class.
My grandpa played piano at Carnegie Hall.
Oh.
Well, make sure you write that down, Timmy.
Now, everyone, let's take out our pencils and our papers, and let's get started.
Any word on the men who tried to rob the payroll coach?
Don't worry, the Mounties will catch them soon enough.
Let me ask you something, how is it someone that beautiful isn't already spoken for?
I don't know much about her, except that she's a good nurse.
I bet there's a lot to learn.
Did you hear back from Mr. Jenkins from the bank?
He said we can count payroll tomorrow night, after he closes up.
I'll be there.
Good morning, Henry.
Good morning.
The townsfolk seem quite pleased with you.
That was a bold move, standing up to the railroad like that.
Some people don't think I stood up enough.
But I've heard it said that the best compromise is one where both sides are a little unhappy.
In this case, I think I'd have to disagree with that.
I did my homework, Henry.
Other mayors have worked with the railroad and not given away the store.
Well, I think they'll pay for it sooner or later.
Well, that's your opinion.
Hmm.
I-I was just looking at... pickles.
Oh, Murphy, pickles indeed.
You were looking at Katie Yost.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
In fact, I think you should ask her out.
Oh, no...
I couldn't do that.
Why not?
She's unattached.
What if she said no?
Hmm...
"A faint heart never won fair maiden."
Maybe later.
I remember when I was that young.
Yeah, they're green, but I'll whip 'em into shape.
Remember, I learned from the best.
And you've turned into a fine leader.
Thanks.
I got to admit,
I was surprised to hear you turned down Collins' offer.
Well, I had my reasons.
She's a very pretty one.
You got a girl waiting for you back home?
Not me.
I'm surprised.
You always were lucky with the ladies.
Ancient history.
"The greatest reward in life is to serve others with a single-minded purpose."
Now, why does that sound so familiar?
It's a quote from...
Sergeant Major Brookings.
He was the wisest man in the regiment, and a real hero.
If I had someone waiting for me at home,
I just couldn't do what I'm supposed to do.
I couldn't serve the way I know I should.
I know exactly what you mean.
But you found your purpose here.
I have.
So... you got any plans for tonight?
How much do you like pot roast?
Mr. Wyatt?
Do you have a moment?
What's it about?
Um...
It's the school.
It's getting very crowded.
And you're telling me this because...
Well, it isn't fair to the children, and a lot of them come from railroad families.
Let's see... first, you have a problem with the men here working long hours, now you have a problem with the school being too crowded.
You seem to have a lot of issues, don't you?
Uh, I just feel that the railroad isn't paying its fair share.
You're taking advantage of Hope Valley.
We're a business, Miss Thatcher, and you're a schoolteacher.
And frankly, what we do is none of your concern.
Mr. Wyatt,
I teach my students fairness.
I teach them to be good citizens...
I really don't have time for this.
Well, maybe,
I should reach out to the community and let them know what's going on.
Or maybe the newspaper should print a story about how overcrowded the school is, and how the railroad isn't pulling its weight.
It sounds like you're making this into a crusade.
I never give up on my students.
She's becoming a problem.
Every problem has a solution.
Finish your spaghetti, and we'll play dominos.
It's not the same without Pastor Frank.
Well, we'll still have fun, won't we?
I wish you guys were talking again.
Cody, sometimes grownups need a little time apart, especially when they're not seeing eye to eye.
What does that mean?
You know when you and Robert play baseball, and you both want to be the pitcher, but neither of you wants to give in?
Yeah, but then we figure it out.
Well...
Pastor Frank and I haven't quite figured it out yet.
But you will, won't you?
Why don't I get you a slice of that chocolate cake I promised?
You are such a good dancer.
Oh, I'm sure Jack's better than I am.
Oh, no, no,
I yield to you on this, sir.
Did you take lessons?
No, but my mom loved to dance.
My dad traveled a lot, so I filled in.
How is your mom?
Good.
She's always asking about you.
She thinks of Jack as a son.
Sometimes, I think she likes him better than me.
Well, he is very lovable.
It's getting late, I better hit the sack.
Thank you for the hospitality, Miss Thatcher.
Oh, we've danced the foxtrot, you can call me Elizabeth.
Yes, ma'am.
I really admire what you're doing.
Just be safe.
That's the plan.
Doug.
He seems so young to be leading all those men.
Do you think he's up to it?
I'll be praying for him.
Then I will, too.
What, no breakfast?
Oh.
I'm sorry, Lee, I've just been so busy.
Doing what?
My column.
The time I spent working at the cafe has put my finger back on the pulse of what's going on around here.
It's as if the whole town desperately needs my advice.
They're deprived of love!
I'm deprived of food.
Oh, listen to this one.
"When two grownups are mad at each other, how do you make them not mad at each other anymore?"
"Grownups?"
And it's signed "Anonymous," spelled incorrectly, which means it must be one of Elizabeth's students.
Oh, my goodness!
This is from Cody!
Well, I saw Abigail and Frank yesterday.
Let's just say, there is trouble in paradise.
Well then,
I certainly have my work cut out for me.
Sweetheart, maybe we should just stay out of their business, hmm?
Lee!
This is my job!
What kind of advice columnist would I be if I didn't come to the rescue of a sticky little tow-headed boy?
Oh...
Need a hand?
No, I'm good, thanks.
I haven't seen you around here before.
Jesse Flynn.
I work up at the sawmill.
Carson Shepherd.
I just started with the railroad.
Good luck.
Look out!
Are you all right?
Biddy Betsy almost got hurt.
Mm-hmm.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine, just... run along.
You all right?
Sure.
I'm just gonna sit here for a while.
Oh!
There he is.
Good morning, young man.
I suppose you're on your way to school.
You're going to school, too?
No, silly.
But I'm walking you to school because you and I have a lot to talk about.
We do?
I got your letter.
How did you know it was from me?
It doesn't matter.
What does matter is, I think I can help you with Miss Abigail and Pastor Frank.
That's great!
I wrote down this lovely little poem by Elizabeth Barrett Browning.
A poem?
Well, not just any poem.
One of the most romantic poems ever written.
"How do I love thee?"
Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth
"and height my soul..."
I'm gonna be late for school...
Of course you are.
All you need to do is slip this into Pastor Frank's jacket.
When he finds it, he will know that it's from Miss Abigail, and it will absolutely melt his heart.
Guaranteed.
That's a great idea!
Those are the only kind I have.
Philip... would you like some help?
I'm done.
Are you sure?
I don't see anything there about your mother.
She died.
My dad died, too, but I still wrote lots of things down.
That's wonderful, Harper.
I don't want to do this anymore.
Okay, uh... time for recess, everyone.
Maybe you could tell me one thing you remember about your mommy, and I could help you write it down.
But I don't know anything.
Well, I'm sure your daddy's told you something about her.
I'm not allowed to talk about her.
Why not?
Because I took her away.
Oh.
She died when you were born.
It's my fault that she's not here.
No, that's not true, Philip.
Yes, it is, and that's why my daddy doesn't love me.
No.
No matter what you think, it is not your fault.
I want to go to recess now.
Thank you.
Mr. Gowen?
This letter just came in for you.
Special Delivery.
Oh, thank you so much.
Well, that's grand.
There you go.
Try to keep it dry.
Mr. Shepherd, please...
How did you get hurt?
Ah, just... just clumsy.
Let's see.
You might have pulled a costal muscle.
It's more likely a hairline fract...
Uh...
I think I cracked a rib.
All I need is a compression wrap.
You know a lot about these things, don't you?
I work for the railroad.
I've been injured more than once.
Well, it'll be the last time for a while.
Whether it's a fracture or a torn muscle, you won't be able to perform strenuous labor for some time.
You see, the railroad's got a funny rule about that.
If you don't work, you don't get paid.
And I'm kind of fond of eating.
Just wrap me up,
I'll be fine.
If you do more damage to your ribs, it might become permanent.
You should think about the long term.
My stomach only cares about today.
I'm not sure when I'll see you again, so take care of yourself.
You fight the good fight, Doug.
Good luck, boys.
Mounties!
Move out!
Mr. Cantrell...
Is Philip all right?
He's fine, I just need to talk to you.
I'm on the clock.
What's going on?
Um, your son said something that has me concerned.
It's about his mother.
Philip said he's the reason she's not here anymore.
Excuse me?
He thinks it's his fault she died, and that you blame him for that.
Well, I never said that.
Well, whether you said it or not, he thinks you feel that way.
And if you could just sit down and talk to him, and explain what happened.
I knew going to school was going to be too much for him.
He's too young.
No, that's not what this is about.
I'm afraid it is.
Well, taking him out of school isn't the answer.
It is for me.
I gotta get back to work.
Mr. Cantrell...
I don't know, I still say we just move on.
But don't you see?
Everybody thinks we're already gone.
That payroll will be easy pickins'.
You got a plan?
I always got a plan.
Henry...
What are you doing behind my desk?
Well, some good news.
You needn't consider it your desk any longer.
What are you talking about?
Well, they suspended the investigation against me, dropped all the charges.
And now your services as mayor of Hope Valley will no longer be needed.
I went to the campsite, looking for you.
We need to finish our conversation.
Look, I appreciate that you care about Philip, but I know what's best for him.
But you can't let him believe that he's the reason his mother died.
And you can't keep shutting him out.
I don't shut him out.
Yes, you do.
Do you know that Philip's favorite book is "Quack Quack Duck"?
Or that he drinks all his milk before starting his sandwich at lunch?
Or that he can't even say "sandwich,"
so he calls it his "sang-wich?"
Your little boy needs you, Mr. Cantrell.
He needs you to give him a hug every now and again.
He needs you to love him as much as he loves you.
Of course, I love him.
But you're holding back.
My wife... she wasn't supposed to die.
We were supposed to be a family together.
I know.
But it wasn't Philip's fault that his mother died.
It wasn't fair, either.
Life isn't fair.
We have to go on.
And there's a little boy out there who is in desperate need of a real father.
One who will laugh with him, and read to him, and dry his tears.
Please... forgive him, and let go of what happened.
Good night, Miss Thatcher.
That's about it!
Thanks for your help, Murph.
My pleasure.
Looked like you had your hands full.
I appreciate it.
I'd better get back to work.
Okay.
Take care, Pastor.
I don't understand, what happened with the investigation against Mr. Gowen?
It was dropped.
But Jack said the Inspector General had solid evidence against him.
They did.
But the accountant who was going to testify against him changed his story, swears it was a bookkeeping mistake.
Isn't that convenient?
Somehow Mr. Gowen always finds a way out.
Not this time.
Well, I thought you said the Mounties dropped the case.
They did, but I'm not a Mountie.
This smells like a payoff, pure and simple to me.
Now all I have to do is prove it.
Ladies...
After all you've done for the town, he thinks he can just waltz in like nothing happened.
Well, at least
I'll get to spend more time with Cody.
That's true.
You sure you're okay?
You seem calm.
I am calm.
At least for now.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
What are you so happy about?
You won't believe it, but I found this in my jacket.
I think it might be from Miss Yost.
Okay, what does it say?
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways..."
Oh...
How sweet.
Doesn't he have something he needs to do?
Huh?
Uh... yes, right.
Inventory reports, uh, need to be taken to the mill.
They're on my desk.
Okay.
What was all that about?
That poem!
I gave it to Cody to give to Frank.
It was supposed to be from Abigail.
Excuse me?
Oh, you can never depend on a little boy to do anything right.
Now poor Murphy, he thinks he has a secret admirer, and I cannot break his heart.
What am I going to do?
Fix it.
That's what you're gonna do.
Come...
Oh...
And don't forget to work on your family trees.
What can I do for you, Mr. Wyatt?
I've been thinking about the conversation we had.
And?
I don't often say this, but... you were right, and I was wrong.
The railroad is the main reason for all your new students, and we need to do our part.
What does that mean, exactly?
National Pacific is going to give you twice the current budget of the school.
You won't be short on supplies, or books, or anything else.
Mr. Wyatt, I can't tell you how much I appreciate that, and-and, in fact, the whole town will be thrilled when they hear about it.
Consider it an investment in the students, and the future of Hope Valley.
I really messed up, didn't I?
Cody, it's all right.
You're just a little boy who makes mistakes now and then.
Mostly now.
But the good news is, I have another idea.
Cody!
Cody, it's time for you to do your homework.
But you said I could play with Robert.
Okay, but I want you back inside in an hour.
Hmm.
As I was saying, all you need to do is leave these at Pastor Frank's door.
When he finds them, he'll think they're from Miss Abigail.
He'll come here, they'll run into each other's arms... and all will be wonderful.
Thanks for the help, Miss Rosemary.
It's what I do.
Abigail...
I've been meaning to talk to you.
You've heard Dottie's opening a dress shop?
I have.
Well, you know I love to sew...
I guess what I'm trying to say is... well, now that you're not mayor anymore, and you have more time for the cafe...
You would like to work there.
I didn't want to talk to her until I knew it was okay with you.
Clara, you've been a godsend, but if it's time for you to start a new chapter in your life.
Of course, you have my blessing.
You sure you don't mind?
I was going to take that "help wanted" sign down, but it looks like it's staying in the window permanently.
Oh, look at Murphy, chatting up Katie Yost.
You should have more faith in your wife's skills as a matchmaker.
It's not your skill, it's Cody's mistake.
Love doesn't make mistakes.
It's only a matter of time before those two lovebirds are waltzing down the aisle.
I wouldn't save the date just yet.
Oh, don't be such a sourpuss.
The railroad is doubling the budget for the school?
Mm-hmm.
That's more than you could have dreamed of.
You are one persuasive lady.
Not always.
Give Philip's dad some time, I'm sure he'll come around.
I just hope I haven't pushed him too far.
You told him the truth about his son.
He needed to hear it.
I'm glad I found you.
You dropped this at the infirmary.
Thank you.
That's a lovely photo.
Who is it?
Enjoy your evening.
Jack!
Bill and Wyatt are in there counting payroll.
You got it.
Elizabeth, I need you to stay here, but don't let anyone leave.
Didn't know there'd be a crowd.
Lose the gun.
Let Jenkins go, you don't need him.
Put everything back in the bags, and hurry up!
You know he's going to kill us.
Not if I can help it.
Fill the bags.
Glenn Tate, is that you?
Matt Landry... what are you doing here?
Ruining your plans.
I wouldn't.
Drop it!
Thanks for what you did last night.
Ah, it was no big deal.
Yes, it was.
I know we've had our differences, but I think I misjudged you.
Well, you can make it up by buying me a drink.
Sounds good.
Jack said they couldn't have caught the robbers without Frank.
Well, I'm glad everyone's safe.
You two still aren't talking?
I guess we're both being a little stubborn.
A little?
Did you hear, Abigail?
About?
Mayor Gowen just waived all taxes for the railroad.
They won't pay a single dime to Hope Valley.
I knew it would have been better for the town if you had stayed on as our mayor.
Can you believe it?
The minute he gets his office back, he gives them everything they want.
Where are you going?
Well, isn't this cozy?
Good morning, Abigail, we're just in a meeting.
I'm sure congratulating each other.
You suddenly become mayor, and you suddenly getting everything you want.
I don't like what you're implying, Mrs. Stanton.
And I don't like that you two worked out a deal.
You disappointed me, Henry.
I gave you a second chance.
I really wanted to believe that you'd changed.
Perhaps you weren't cut out for being mayor.
If being mayor means cheating this town, then you're right.
Careful, Abigail.
No, Henry, you be careful.
Cody!
How did our little plan go?
It didn't.
Oh, no!
What happened this time?
Well, Robert and I stopped to play catch.
And...
I put the chocolates down on the field.
And?
And...
I forgot them.
Well then, you go back, and you get them.
I tried, but they were gone.
Robert!
Did you see a box of chocolates on the baseball field?
Oh, I sure did!
They were really good!
Now what?
Well, you know what they say.
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
We've already tried and tried again.
I suppose you're right about that.
You know what else they say?
What?
Two heads are better than one.
What does that mean?
It means maybe you and I can come up with an idea together.
Come on...
There you go.
Thank you very much, Nurse Carter.
You're very welcome, Mr. Hikcomb.
Ah, Mr. Shepherd.
How can I help you?
I need something to kill the pain.
I wouldn't advise that.
I don't want you to hurt yourself any worse than you already have.
Then I'll lose my job.
There are other jobs in Hope Valley.
Nobody knows me here.
Nobody's going to hire me.
I do, and I know of a position that needs to be filled.
Doing what?
Miss Thatcher!
Philip!
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.
Can I go work on my family tree?
I want to finish it!
Well, it's right where you left it.
I'm so glad you changed your mind.
He really belongs in school.
I thought about what you said, and it's true.
I was angry about what happened.
I let it get the best of me, and I shouldn't have taken it out on him.
Well, that's in the past now.
I made a lot of mistakes.
But that's gonna change now.
I want to do right by my boy.
I want to be a good dad.
I just hope I know how.
Well, you could start by giving him a hug.
Excuse me, um...
Do you still need help?
If you can cook.
I worked six months in a chuck wagon for a crew of miners before I got a job with the railroad.
Then you have experience.
What about references?
The nurse down at the infirmary, she's the one that sent me here.
Well, if Faith thinks he can be trusted...
Look!
I got an "A" on my family tree!
Oh, Cody, that's wonderful.
But I'm right in the middle of a meeting with this gentleman.
Can we go fishing?
To celebrate?
Oh, sweetheart, I would love to, but someone has to work in the kitchen.
I could start right now, if you give me the job.
I could really use it.
And I'm a hard worker.
I don't even know your name.
It's Carson Shepherd.
Please, Miss Abigail?
I'll be around to help if he needs anything.
Welcome to Abigail's Cafe, Mr. Shepherd.
What was that all about?
Never you mind...
Murphy!
Did you invite Katie Yost out yet?
Oh, I haven't had the chance.
But I saw the two of you having a wonderful time together.
But I didn't want to push my luck.
Katie!
Yoo-hoo!
Yes, Mrs. Coulter?
Could you please join us for a moment?
Murphy has something to say to you.
"Fairest Katie..."
"I deeply apologize"
for being an utter goose.
I find myself thinking of you often...
May I take you on a picnic tomorrow?
I thought you'd never ask.
I'm free at 1:00.
Oh...
I usually go for lunch at noon.
I'm sure Mr. Coulter will make an exception.
1:00 would be fine with me.
Oh, wow, it's kinda crowded.
Guess I'll go try somewhere more quiet.
Don't tell me.
Cody invited you.
I'm sorry, I...
Me first.
Please.
It's been so long since I've had to tell anyone what I'm doing, or where I've been,
I guess it kind of threw me for a loop.
I'm not used to having anyone worry about me.
Is that a bad thing?
Absolutely not.
I have to admit,
I was scared.
Abigail, you don't have to worry.
I'm not going to go back to my outlaw life.
No...
I was scared because I realized how much I care about you.
Well, it sounds like we're on the same page.
It sounds like we are.
Everything all right?
Yeah.
I'm just thinking about Doug and his men.
They're probably in the thick of it by now.
Well, if they're as good at their jobs as you are at yours, then they'll be fine.
You just bought yourself dinner at the saloon.
Why don't you get us a table?
I left my shawl at school.
I'll see you there.
Mm-hmm.
