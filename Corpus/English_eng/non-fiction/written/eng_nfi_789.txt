[Alba] In 1928, women were essentially seen as accessories to be shown off... objects unable to express an opinion or make a decision.
Life wasn't easy for anyone, but it was even harder for women.
If you were a woman in 1928, freedom seemed impossible to achieve.
To society, we were just housewives and mothers.
We didn't have the right to have dreams or ambitions.
To seek a future, many women had to travel far and wide...
You're not going anywhere!
...and others had to confront the norms of a backward, chauvinist society.
-Leave her alone!

Stay out of this!
In the end, all of us, rich or poor, wanted the same thing:
to be free.
And if, to be free, we had to break the law, we were willing to do it, regardless of the consequences.
Only those who fight for their dreams can achieve them.
Or so we thought...
What we didn't know was that fate had many surprises in store for us.
-Let's go!

Argentina awaits.
-[both laughing] Come on!
You've never been on a ship.
-[Pedro] You thought you'd get away?

Don't you dare move.

-She never wants to see you again.

If you shout, I swear I'll kill you.
Calm down, I'm begging you.
[Pedro] I will when you tell your friend you're coming with me.
-She's not going with you.

Otherwise, first I'll kill her, then you.
Fine, I'll do whatever you want, but put the gun down, okay?
[yells] [both grunt]
[Alba grunting]
[breathing heavily]
Gimena, no, please... [softly] Look at me.
[Alba] You shouldn't have been here.
I shouldn't have brought you.

-Shh...

-It still is.

[sobbing]
[thunder rumbling]
[Beltrán] So you were in the street with two bodies, but you had nothing to do with it.
[clears throat]
-Why should I believe you?

Alba Romero, 25.

Do you know what happens to murderers?
-The garrote.

Unless they cooperate with us.
How?
By doing what you do best... stealing.
But this time, for me.

[Alba] The new skyscraper of the only telephone company in the country.
Thirteen floors, over 30 million meters of cable, thousands of employees, executives, switchboard operators,
800 job openings... and a safe full of money to steal.
[Sara] Please, ladies...
Welcome to the Telephone Company's new head office.
Forgive the chaos.

As of today, many of the company's services as well as the city's phone connections, will be centralized in this building.
So I ask you to pay attention.
CHAPTER 1:

Candidates for switchboard operators, line up on the left and state your names.
Welcome to the Telephone Company.

-Yes, I'm here for the tests.

Tell me your name.

-Lidia.

-Lidia Aguilar.

I'm sorry, you're not on the short list.
-Short list?

They were inundated with applications, so they made a short list.
-I'm sorry, Lidia.

Your name is?
Lidia Aguilar.
The tests begin at twelve o'clock.
Anyone not inside the hall by then won't be participating.
There are 390 applications for just 12 positions.
Twelve fortunate women will be getting the best job of their lives.
So look sharp.
Follow me, please.
You're in Madrid's most modern building.
Thirteen floors devoted to the Telephone Company.
On the first floor, reception and the sales department.
On the fourth and fifth floors, administrative services.
On the sixth and seventh floors, the switchboard rooms, where chosen applicants will have the privilege of working.
Next, two floors with the machine rooms, maintenance and the engineering offices.
Above this are the floors for events and meetings.
And finally, management offices are on the 13th floor
TELEPHONE COMPANY
MANAGEMENT OFFICE
-Thank you.

Excuse me.
Miss, what are you doing here?
I'm here for the operator tests.
Someone said they were here, but I don't see anybody!
[chuckles] They're here if you're a man in a suit looking to be an accounts executive, which you aren't.
Switchboard tests are on the sixth floor.
The doors close in two minutes.

Punctuality comes first here.
-Thank you.

All right.

Uh, honey, you'd better take the stairs.
[chuckles]
[both yelp]
They shut the door.

The tests started at 12:00.
I got lost three times in the subway.
[Ángeles] No, you can't...
Yes?
Excuse me, we're here for the switchboard operator tests.
-You're late.

I know punctuality comes first in this company.
Then why did you knock?
To find out if understanding comes second.
Look at her.
Straight from the station with her suitcase.
-Six hundred kilometers to get here.

Yeah.
And because she was one minute late, she'll go home empty-handed.
It's my fault...

[stammers] I'm sorry.
I offered to accompany them since I was bringing you these papers, and I got the floors mixed up.
-You got the floors mixed up?

Your first mistake since you started working for me.
As you see, our workers are very understanding.
But, unfortunately for you,
Ángeles doesn't decide if you get through this door.
I do.
-Thank you.

If I went back to the village without doing the tests--

With a name like that, you must be our guardian angel.
I wouldn't say that. [chuckles]
Sorry.

Excuse me.
Would there be a way to pass the tests without taking them?
No.
Good morning.
Ladies.
I see this is going to be a great day for the company.
Are you all here for the tests?
It's going to be very hard to choose.
If only we could buy more switchboards and give you all jobs.
-[Ángeles chuckles] -[pencil clatters]
Thank you.
I don't want to make you more nervous than you already are, so good luck to all of you.

Remedios Fuentes, selected.

Marta Rodríguez, selected.

Verónica Sánchez, selected.

Carlota Rodríguez de Senillosa, selected.
María José Pando, selected.
María Inmaculada Suárez, selected.
Congratulations to all those chosen.
Excuse me.
Sorry, my name wasn't called.
-You didn't pass.

The results are not public, but they are fair.
-I am entitled to--

You didn't pass, period.
[Carlos] Is there a problem?
[inhales deeply]
Miss Aguilar, which academy did you go to?
-None.

-Yes.

Haven't you ever studied anything on your own?
To be honest, I've never studied.
But don't tell my father.
I wouldn't want him to think he wasted his money on my boarding school.
I imagine that, after doing well on the tests, you don't know why you weren't chosen.
It's your arms.
-What?

There are many subscribers, the switchboards are big, and sometimes an operator has to handle two switchboards.
If I may say...
You're two centimeters under the minimum.
If I may be so bold, Don Carlos, this requirement is nonsense.
-Excuse me?

She only had one hand.
So it's not the length, it's the skill.
Why do you want to be an operator?
You want me to say it's the greatest job in the world.
But we both know I'd be lying.
Your job is much better.
But, unfortunately, I'm told it isn't available.
A woman with character, the gift of the gab and a sense of humor.
Not the first one you've met, I'm sure.
I've met a few... but I don't know if any were like you.
No, they weren't.
Carolina, see the lady downstairs.
Tell Sara she's on the list.
-Welcome aboard, Miss Aguilar.

The next time you want to impress a manager, don't tell him you want to take his job.
And the next time you want to impress a woman, don't make her feel you're only interested in her measurements.
The wouldn't-hurt-a-fly act worked.
Excuse me?

The goody-two-shoes act may work on Sara and Carlos, but not on me.
I'll be watching you.
Honey, you'd better take the stairs.
[chuckles softly]
-[lines ringing] -[indistinct chatter]
[Ángeles] Good afternoon.

One moment, please.
Central here.

Do you wish to take it?
Thank you.
[Sara] Thanks, Ángeles.

Ángeles knows the company and her job better than anyone else.
[Alba] The operator who knows this company and her job better than anyone else.
If anyone could tell me all I needed to know to rob the safe, it was Ángeles.
There are three shifts:

I'd have to get close to her and get her to trust me enough to tell me the secrets of the Telephone Company.
[Sara] When you hear the gong, it's time to change positions, is that clear?
Good.

Don Francisco, the new employees.
Marta Rodríguez...
-Isn't Carlos Cifuentes the director?

-[Sara] María Inmaculada Suárez.

[Sara] Laura Sarmiento.
Petra Silva.
Lourdes Trapero.
This is Raquel Levante.
Remedios Fuentes.
Carlota Rodríguez de Senillosa.
Lidia Aguilar.
Alba.
I'm sorry, but you've mistaken me for someone else.
My name's Lidia Aguilar.

I'm sorry, Miss Aguilar.
You reminded me of an old friend.
Don't worry.
[Sara] María José Pando.
[young Francisco] Come on, Alba!
Run!
Pass me the suitcase!
TEN YEARS EARLIER [young Alba] I can't believe we're going to Madrid.
-Do you regret it?

[Francisco chuckles]
I'm thinking of all I'll do when I get there, like finding a job.
Then I'll save a lot of money.

-A White Lady?

[chuckles]
-What are you going to do?

I'm going to kiss that lovely birthmark on your neck.
[train whistle sounding]
Hey!

-Hey!

Listen, I...
Let go of me!

Francisco!
[phone ringing]
-I told you not to call me here.

A problem's come up.
I can't do the heist I planned.

Don't give me your life story.
You know the penalty for murder?

You have one day to avoid it.
Tomorrow at 1:00, in the park.
Carlota, do you know how to get here?
Dolores' Boardinghouse on Blancaró.
Yes, you can't miss it.
Go straight ahead, take the third street on the left- [Miguel] It's the second on the left.

Miguel Pascual, communications engineer.
Madrid born and bred.

[laughs] Did you hear, Marga?

Not many of those around.
-I agree.

-This is Miguel.

Don't say that word in front of her.

[chuckles] I'm going to the bar across the street later.

I'll finish up and see you there.
Lidia, are you coming to the bar with us?
No, I've got things to do.
[Marga] Can I come?
It's to thank Ángeles for what she did for us.
Ángeles is going?
Yes, she left her daughter with a neighbor.

[Ángeles] Good evening.
The Cifuentes family made a huge investment in erecting this building.
Naturally, they want to increase security.
We only have access during our shift.
They have to be careful.
Everything goes through head office.
Company earnings, payroll...

[Marga] Grandma, you're going to make me deaf!
See?

Just wait till I tell Rosario...
Grandma, before you say anything...
I've been thinking about it and...
I should turn down the job and go back to the village.
What?

We're not a rich family, and you haven't got a husband to support you.
I won't let you stay here for the rest of your life looking after an old lady.
You gave up enough for your mother.

Sure, Grandma... but I was happy with you and my mother.
She was with you, too.

For once in your life, think just about yourself, not everyone else.
I know.

-the capital's too big for me.

And so does life if you don't make the most of it.
-Don't forget that.

I have to go, Grandma.
Take care. [kisses] I love you.
[sighs]
-That's a lot of money.

Stop talking shop, and let's have a toast.
Vermouth.
But vermouth has alcohol in it.
[laughs] Yes, but you can order something else if you like.
No, that's okay.
Maybe it's too strong for me, too.
I haven't had one since...

I haven't been in a bar since I got pregnant.
It'll prepare you for the champagne at the party tonight.
[Marga] What party?
-[Carlota] The grand opening party.

I can't go.

But the operators are going, the clerks, even the bosses...
The Cifuenteses are mingling with the workers.

-It's about time!

I don't like parties much.
[scoffs] To say you don't like parties, you have to have gone to at least one in your life.
[laughs] And you look like you've never been to any!
Come on, let's toast.

Let's toast to Marga and her first vermouth.
To Ángeles, because she helped us get this opportunity.
-And to the new cable girls.

Ah!

[man] Carlota.
Get your things and come with me right now.
No.

I have a job and I'm an independent woman.
Let go of me.

Let go of me!
-[Miguel] Don Emilio--

You're nothing to this family.
You'll have to force me.
[Emilio] You thought I wouldn't find out?

[Carlota] Since you stopped caring about what I want.
I don't want a husband.

A girl of your class doesn't work.

I said get in!
[all gasp]
Yes, sir, Colonel.
[stuttering] So that's...
Carlota's father, yes.
Well, I'd better go home.

-Can you find the boardinghouse?

Carlota told me how to get from here to Blancaró Street.
-Good.

Ángeles!

Let the champagne flow and get whatever the gentlemen need!
I assume you're here because you did it.
I got the job, and I know where the safe is.
But there's a problem.

-[Victoria] Francisco?

-[Victoria] What?

-[Victoria] Did he see you?

[Victoria] You have to get out of there right away.
[Alba] I can't.

[Victoria] If I had that money...
You know me.
Victoria, I'm doing it tonight.
One of the girls said that there's security, but I can do it.
I'll go to the party, get the keys, take the money, and tomorrow I'll be far away from here.
And from Francisco.
-Alba, I think--

If I see him, I'll give him the slip.
Alba, rushing things is never wise.
It's crazy.
It's either that or the garrote.
Ah!
Room 27.
Come here.
Alba, honey, I've already lost Gimena.

Dinner is at 8:30, and the door is locked at 11:00.
I know I needn't worry about your behavior.
Your grandmother assured me that you're a responsible girl.
This is a decent boardinghouse, and now it's your home.
Come.
Here.

-Good night.

I promise I'll be back before you lock the door.
Very well.

There's always some swine waiting to take advantage of a decent girl.
You know, "open mind, closed legs."
-Good night.

-[laughing] What?

You're talking to the new chief technician for the head office of the country's largest telephone company.
-When did it happen?

I almost hugged that stuffed shirt!
-Mario!

I'm just saying what everyone thinks.
-Wonderful!

You'll stop working.

You understand?

I love you.

I'm so happy!
Yes.
-Mario, you want me to stop working?

Well, yeah.
Yes, we did, but... that was before, and...
Mario, I love my job.
More than being at home with your husband and daughter?
No, you two are my priority.

If we're your priority, what are you doing drinking vermouth while we're at home?
God, it was the first time in three years.
Mario... [door slams] [sighs]
Aren't you coming down for supper?
We're doing this for your own good.
Have you stopped to think that it might not be what's best for me?

[Marga] My goodness, there are so many people here.

I knew I couldn't miss this!

[Marga] I still can't believe you're here.
When your father came into the bar, I almost got in the car, I was so scared.
Do you know what a woman's worst enemy is?
Submission.
-I was always taught to obey.

"A woman needs to always be proper and obedient, Carlota."
But one day I thought,
"You're not a woman.

So he can lock all the doors he wants.
"There is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind."
Virginia Woolf said that.
Is she a friend of yours?
[crowd applauding]
[Carmen] It's not as if we're royalty.
Since when do you mind being the center of attention?
Who said I minded?
Will anything ever be good enough for you?
I thought marrying you was good enough.

I'm going to mingle.

-Aguilar. [chuckles]

[Carlos] What a pleasant surprise.
So I see.

Ah!

Is that what you're doing?

Some things you do out of obligation, others you do for pleasure.
Clearly, this is the latter.
I see the party is turning out to be fun.
Miss Aguilar, Francisco Gómez.
-We met earlier.

-A drink?

A White Lady?

This night deserves a toast.
Thanks, but I don't like White Ladies.
Now that's what I call honesty!

Luckily, Miss Aguilar has more than enough for both of us.
Along with other virtues.
-Such as?

-I think we'll have to wait to find out.

[chuckling] Darling!
My father asked me to tell you you're expected on stage.
[Carlos] Stay there, miss.

[Ricardo] I want to thank all of you who have come here tonight to join with us in celebrating the opening of Europe's largest telephone exchange.
You all know that this hasn't been an easy road, nor a short one.
And that all these gray hairs are due to that road.
But we're finally here.
And we wouldn't be if it weren't for the person who was the driving force behind this project.
He's loyal, hardworking and honest.
And it gives me great peace of mind to leave this company's future in my son-in-law's hands, someone I consider my son,
Francisco Gómez.

[crowd applauding]
[Francisco] Thank you.

Ten years ago, I couldn't have imagined being here today.
I would've settled for a good job and a place to share with the love of my life.
Today, I have almost everything I dreamt of.
Almost, because one could always want something more.
Today is the beginning of a new era for the company, one that will span the oceans.
I am pleased to announce that tomorrow, this company is to make its first intercontinental call.
President Coolidge and His Majesty Alfonso XIII will establish the first connection between Spain and the United States.
[Alba] I'd tried to convince myself that Francisco meant nothing to me.
If I wanted to be free, I couldn't be led by my heart.
That night, I'd steal the money from the company and run far away from any ghost from the past.
Good or bad, just to be myself.
Excuse me, miss.

That says "day shift."
Only night shift employees are allowed in.
I know, but I'll just be a minute.

I'm sorry.

But my house keys are in it.
And there's no one I can call.
Please do me this favor.
Otherwise, I'll have to spend the night on the street.
I'll just be a moment.
GENERAL DIRECTOR
We must be the only two not invited to the party.
Julian says even the stockroom workers went.
-[upbeat song playing]

No.
On a bad day, you can put it on and forget everything.

There are better songs.
But if it helps you forget your troubles...
-How did you get out of the barracks?

A soldier's life is tough.
It's a good thing that the nights are much more fun.
Let's dance.

[grunting]
[grunts] Are you all right?
[panting]
I couldn't catch him, but I got your purse.

[Carlota exclaims]
[chuckling] I wonder what excuse I'll use to get to my shift on time tomorrow.
You can't keep doing this for the rest of your life.
I've got no choice.
-Yes, you do.

-Marry me.

I didn't think I'd ask you either, but it's the solution.
-Oh, it's the solution, yes.

You wouldn't depend on your father.
No, I'd depend on you, my husband.

You think I'd tell you what to do?
You're drunk.

Yes, I'm drunk.

[man] Let's go, Miguel!
[Miguel] Good night!

[faint clanging]
[sighs]
-[whispering] Don't make noise.

-I don't know where Miguel is.

Both beds are for you.

-Why?

I got lost on the subway, broke my bag and got robbed.
-Robbed?

-I'm not staying.

Do you know how long I faked going to a sewing circle?
One year.

I didn't want my parents to know I wanted to work.
I was afraid they'd throw me out of the house.
Gee.

Sorry?

I'm not sorry.
Want to know the good part?

I don't know how you can take it so well.
What else can I do?
Cry because my parents prefer their ideas to who I am?
No.

You can look on the negative side, and cry and complain.
Or look on the fun side, enjoy it, laugh, and move forward.
That's what I've chosen to do.
Everything in life has its good side, even Madrid.
Even if you don't see it.
Unless I rob that safe during the call... you'll have to find another home.
[cat meows]
Beltrán won't give me any more time.
I either hand over the money tomorrow at one o'clock or...
This is my last chance.
[newsboy] Extra!

Extra!

-Mario, can I talk to you?

I was up all night worried about you.
-Where were you?

All night?
All night.

-Mario--

I don't want to argue, just talk.

You want to talk?
Talk.
Mario, can't you understand that it bothers me when you ask me to stop working?
I can't believe this!

-That I don't know that you like your job?

And how hard it is for you to leave all this?
But we have a daughter, and I don't want a stranger taking care of her.
I want her mother to do it.
Have you thought about how it torments me to not give my family what they deserve?
I promised you everything, that you'd live like a queen.
And what did I get?

You've convinced yourself that it's right, and it's not.
Let me make you happy.
Please.
Let's be the family we dreamt of being.
STAFF FILE [door opens and closes]
[Carlos] Good morning.
-What are you looking for?

Either I left them behind here, or I lost them wherever I was last night.
You should try drinking two fewer glasses of brandy.
-It'd be good for your memory.

My soul is free.

Right.
You should try smiling sometime.
Are you all right?
-Do you remember Alba?

[chuckles] [sighs]
The love of your youth who vanished without a word?

Her?

Yesterday, I thought I saw her.
-Again?

Francisco, people change in ten years.
A lot.

[chuckles]
Yes, you're right.

Besides, there's things to be done.
Elegant enough to be immortalized next to His Majesty?
Without those bags under your eyes, I'd say you look quite respectable.
There's a lot to do.
-[stomps foot]

First, inform Sara about who's making the call.
I've taken care of that already.
Personally.
-So?

-Changed your mind?

They're announcing which operator will make the call.
They'll give it to Ángeles.

Ladies, we won't draw this out.
Today, the transoceanic call will be made between the king and the president of the United States.
We're designating an operator to make the call.
It's a great responsibility, and I hope the chosen person takes it as such.
That person is...

Me?
I can't do it.
Excuse me, Miss Aguilar?
I'm new here at the company.

-It should be Ángeles.

It wasn't my decision to make.

So I hope you can carry out your task.
The operator protocol.
Learn it as if your life depended on it.
I can assure you, it does.
The other switchboards will be disconnected for ten minutes.
So all you need to do is witness this moment.
-I won't do it.

You managed the jacks well yesterday.
-I don't mean--

This is a crucial moment for the company, Carlos.
You're jeopardizing it to seduce an operator.
You sound like my father.
You think I'm doing this to seduce her?
-Carlos--

She's an ambitious girl.

-Why didn't you ask me?

Staff selection is my job.
Trust me, please.
Expectations are high among the media here on the tenth floor of the Telephone Company.
Today, at exactly noon, an event will take place that will mark a before and after in history...
The first intercontinental call made from our country, involving two major figures on either side of the Atlantic.
[crowd applauding]
His Majesty Alfonso XIII, whose arrival at the Telephone Company we are about to witness,
will speak to President Coolidge in an exchange that will affirm the strong relationship between our countries.
[Alba] I wasn't afraid of the challenge.
But it would make my objective harder to achieve.
While the whole world was wrapped up in that great historical event...
I'd rob the safe.
I'd put an end to Beltrán's blackmail and flee in search of a new life... far from my past, and far from the man who was once the love of my life.
-It's time, Father.

When you wish, Your Majesty.

Good morning.

Yes, operator?
Could you please connect me with Washington, United States?
Number 0002, with the president.
Of course, Your Majesty.
I'm connecting you now.

I've lost the line.
[Francisco] We checked the circuits.

[Sara] You're doing something wrong.
[Alba] There's no signal.
Jack one to jack two...

[panting]
[in English] Hello?
Washington, DC?
[Alba] An historic day.

The world in the hands of a woman, a switchboard operator.
[Alfonso XIII in English] Thank you very much, Mr. President.
[Alba] Everyone was celebrating this incredible event and felt they were part of a new world...
But some women began to understand that the new world wasn't as idyllic or as simple as they would have liked...
It would involve family sacrifices and loneliness... for independence always comes at a price.
For Gimena, it was her life.
For me, it was being condemned to break the rules.
