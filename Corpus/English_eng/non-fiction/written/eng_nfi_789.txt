When I was a child, my planet Krypton was dying.
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.
But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.
I hid who I really was until one day when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.
To most people, I'm a reporter at CatCo Worldwide Media.
But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.
I am Supergirl.
Previously on Supergirl...
We salvaged you and resurrected you.
And who are you?
I'm a member of an organization called Cadmus.
Thanks for stopping by, Mom.
And I called the police.
I'm not so sure we're a good match.
I'm just glad we're on the same page, you know.
Okay, good.
Checkmate.
Very good.
Now let's see how you defend against the Alekhine Variation.
Lionel?
Keep setting up.
I thought we had discussed this.
Lena.
This is your new mother.
I'm Lex.
I'm going to be your new brother.
Wanna play?
Thank you.
I think having a sister will be good for Lex.
The trial of Lillian Luthor continued today.
Luthor, the suspected head of the anti-alien terrorist organization, Cadmus, has been charged with a host of crimes, including the use of a bio-weapon
in an attempted extermination of all aliens in National City.
That woman is bad news.
Luthor claims that she is a victim...
I hope once she's convicted, they...
They put her out on the town square for public shaming.
On Daxam, it really seemed to cut back on recidivism.
Well, that kind of punishment actually went away a long time ago.
That's too bad.
How are you?
More drinks for you guys?
Another round's on its way.
It's just the first time I've been in this bar since...
M'gann left.
Hey, do we know what, um, what he does for a living?
Alex's guy?
Cop.
Yeah, no way Alex Danvers dates someone who doesn't own a firearm.
Hey, you guys.
How come you never said anything before?
It's not for me to say.
Good for you, Alex.
Yeah.
Drinks up!
Hey!
Here we go, bubbly club soda for the lady.
Thank you.
Okay, that's...
Is that like a problem here on Earth or...
Well, on Earth, you know, not everybody supports ladies loving ladies.
On Daxam it's the more the merrier.
Okay.
Hey, do you play pool?
Pool is easy.
Let's go do it.
Congrats.
Alex, my money's on your girl.
Yes, thanks, me too.
Hey, that cop doesn't know I'm the Guardian, right?
No.
Lucky her.
Testifying today against Luthor is her adopted daughter...
What an awful thing to have to do.
Well, the Luthors have never shied away from doing awful things.
Yeah, but she's not like them.
She knows Lillian is evil, she's doing the right thing, even though she still loves her mother.
What she did was brave.
If you say so.
Using her friends, that's exactly what I'm worried about.
Whoa!
Whoa, buddy, come on.
Sorry!
Lillian Luthor's defense attorneys tried to downplay Lena Luthor's testimony, characterizing her statements as
"the angry rant of an estranged daughter."
Everyone in National City has got an opinion about me.
Ungrateful daughter, heroine, bitch.
And they've all called for a quote.
Not you though, Snapper Carr hasn't sent you here to shake me down.
I thought you could use some fried sugary goodness in your life.
You eat donuts, right?
Um, well...
I am human.
Thank you, Kara.
So, was it awful?
It actually felt good to testify.
I got to say my piece and finally distance myself from the Luthor name.
And then I came back here to 12 calls from her lawyers.
Yeah, she wants to see me.
What do you think she wants?
Probably to tell me that my outfit in court was horrible and that I need a makeover.
I don't know and I don't care.
I just thought I was done with her, you know...
I'd finally shut the door on being a Luthor.
And then there she was, back on my phone sheet.
Twelve times.
You don't think I should feel guilty for not wanting to go see that monster, right?
Well, do you think you would find peace of mind by visiting her and telling her how you really feel?
Even if I did, it wouldn't make a difference.
You know...
She's been the same way since the day I met her.
I've spent most of my life wishing I could talk to people that are no longer here.
She's still here.
And she's still your mom.
Yeah.
You really did a number on me in court.
Measured, succinct, believable.
The jury ate it up.
I can just call the guard back and go.
No.
I'm sorry.
I promised myself I would be better.
Please sit.
Old habits die hard.
I don't want to fight.
I asked you here because I wanted to let you know that I forgive you.
That I still love you.
The only time you ever tell me you love me is when you need something from me.
I know I wasn't the greatest mother, but I did the best that I could.
By making me feel unwanted.
If Dad could hear you now.
After all the things you've done and justified.
You hold Lionel up as some saint, but he's not.
If he was a good man, he would've told you the truth.
But he hated me too much to do that.
Told me the truth about what?
When your father and I first got together, it was the happiest time of my life.
But after Lex was born,
Lionel started having... an affair.
I was clueless, until I went to surprise him on a business trip, only to find that he was with your mother.
My mother?
She was already pregnant with you by then.
They paid her off.
Your father came back to try and rebuild our marriage.
Then when you were four, we heard your mother had died.
The state was going to put you in foster care.
Your father brought you home and we adopted you.
But he didn't like me spending time with you.
I think it made him remember what he'd done.
He felt guilty.
He'd lash out.
So, I stayed away.
Gravitated to Lex.
To protect myself.
And you.
But seeing you with him...
You look so much like her.
It was like ripping a Band-Aid off every day of my life.
So, I really am a Luthor.
We're the only two Luthors left.
And we need to be there for each other.
I want a second chance with you.
Please, honey.
Mail call, Mr. Corben.
Not interested.
Mr. Corben, will you tell the court how you know Lillian Luthor?
She's the doctor who saved my life.
By turning you into a weaponized cyborg?
Objection.
Calls for speculation.
Objection is sustained.
Okay, we'll move on.
After Lillian Luthor saved you, did she order you to work for Cadmus?
She didn't have to order me to do anything.
I believe aliens should be wiped from the Earth.
Starting with Supergirl and her cousin.
I hate him.
He literally has no heart.
And what, if anything, did Lillian Luthor tell you about the Medusa Project?
Earth is in crisis.
Aliens threaten our safety and way of life, bringing violence and disease.
She wanted to save the human race.
Lillian Luthor is not a criminal.
This trial is a conspiracy to condemn the one person who wants to save your lives.
Your children's lives!
Order.
Counselor.
Get control over your witness.
Mr. Corben has become antagonistic and clearly is not willing to answer the questions as directed.
Permission to treat the witness as hostile, Your Honor.
Allow me to treat you as hostile.
Stop.
Go.
The job's not done yet, Luthor.
But not for long.
You can stop me, or you can save them.
Make your choice, Supergirl.
I flew over the whole city twice, they're gone.
Lillian and Metallo have disappeared.
I should've stopped them.
That was the right choice.
Sawyer.
Look, we're gonna find Metallo and we're gonna get him back into custody
I can't figure out where he got all that Kryptonite.
Clark was supposed to have taken all of it.
What's wrong?
I had the jail check all of Corben's visitors to see how the Kryptonite might have gotten smuggled in.
But he hasn't had any visitors since he's been there.
And when they swept his cell yesterday there was nothing out of the ordinary.
Which means he must have gotten the Kryptonite last night.
That seems to narrow down the window.
Why do you look so concerned?
Because there was only one visitor to the jail last night, but it was to visit Lillian Luthor.
Who?
Her daughter, Lena.
You know I was at the jail to see my mother last night.
It's just...
People are losing it because of your mother's escape.
And I wanted you to know so that you could be prepared.
Okay, so...
That you may have also visited Metallo.
And you think that's something I would do.
I...
You know, Kara, you are starting to sound a lot like a reporter and not a friend right now.
I don't mean to.
We're actually here on official business, Kara.
I think it would be better if you waited outside while I talk with Ms. Luthor.
No.
I want her to stay.
If it's okay.
The police were sent some surveillance footage I wanted to ask you about.
Hold on, Maggie, slow down, just let her explain.
Stay out of it, Kara.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford one, one will be provided for you.
Where's my art?
What's going on?
We're crashing the cover.
But our pub date's today.
The cover's set.
Yeah, that's why they call it a crash.
We're the fourth estate, not Reddit.
Copy can't wait another second...
Yeah, yeah.
Wait, you're putting Lena Luthor on the cover?
She doesn't need to be a front-page story.
She's arguably the most famous name in National City, Danvers.
Her notorious brother's in prison.
Of course I'm putting her on the cover, she's a Luthor.
But she didn't do it.
Have you seen the video?
Or are you letting a budding friendship corrupt your reporting?
Who's got confirmation bias now?
She told me, on the record, she didn't do it.
She said, she said.
This time we need more than just a quote.
Otherwise, it's just another conspiracy theory for Twitter.
Well, I'll keep digging then.
Your gumption annoys me to no end.
But keep gumptioning for tomorrow's cover.
Tomorrow?
But that'll be too late.
By then everyone will think she's guilty already.
Everyone will think she's guilty today.
Tomorrow's another story.
But once it's out there, it's out there.
I mean, people still think Macaulay Culkin's dead.
James, come on, you know we can't print this.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree with Snapper.
And I think you should, too.
Kara.
Kara, come on, wait.
No, no, are you kidding me?
The only thing Lena has done is help.
She called the police on her own mother over the Medusa virus.
That's exactly my point.
If she can betray her own mother, what is to stop her from pulling a long con on you?
Okay, I know she's your friend, Kara, but Lena's bad news.
Why, because she's a Luthor?
No, because she's guilty.
And if you don't see that, I'm gonna prove it to you.
Seven...
Gosh!
Eve, I'm so sorry.
Thanks, Kara It's just so busy here today.
With the trial and the daughter.
Yeah.
You look like me the day I forgot to get Ms. Grant's coffee and she made me call the Dean of Yale to admonish him for having given me a diploma.
Sad.
It's just James and...
Lena Luthor and...
Hey, how's everything going with Mon...
Um, with Mike?
Actually, it's not going.
I thought you two were going out.
You mean, went out.
He's so dreamy and handsome and funny, so you can imagine how shocked I was when it turned out to be the worst date of my life.
No.
Did he chew with his mouth open and tell those inappropriate jokes?
No, all he did was talk about you the entire date.
So he talked about me?
I told him, I said you have to get over your ex-girlfriend before you put yourself back out in the field.
Eve, Mike and I never dated.
Mike told me the same thing.
The prodigal daughter.
You think she'll lose her hair like her brother.
How'd you get in?
If Lena was bad,
I knew it was only a matter of time before you showed up to free her.
I do work for the Luthors, after all.
Hello, Ms. Luthor.
Sorry for the delay.
Metallo's strong, but something's off.
His Kryptonite isn't right.
I think it's hurting him.
Well, you're lucky you didn't take a direct hit.
Very lucky.
I had my shield.
I love that shield.
And I know what I'm doing, Kara.
Even if Metallo's weakening, though, he still is a fanatic follower of Lillian Luthor.
We have to find out where he's taken Lena, and help her.
What is it going to take for you to realize that Lena is a criminal?
She's not!
She stopped the gang with alien weapons.
She saved Alex's life when Corben tried to kill her.
She shot Corben and then her crazy mom turned Corben into Metallo.
So, that could have been the plan the entire time.
We have to start treating Lena Luthor like a hostile.
The evidence is too overwhelming.
Winn?
If you watch that video, I know you'll find something.
Then find something to prove her innocent.
Everything we've seen so far says the exact opposite.
Well, she's my friend.
And I believe in her.
I'm your friend.
Which is why I don't understand why it's so hard for you to believe me.
People don't remember this, Kara, but Clark and Lex Luthor used to be best friends.
For years.
And Clark believed in Lex for the longest time.
No matter what people said, no matter what kind of proof he saw with his own eyes.
No, Lex was his friend.
But they grew up in the same house, Kara.
I don't understand why you keep defending her.
And you have so much faith in her, but none in me, as Guardian.
That's entirely different.
I am trying to protect you.
I do not need your protection.
I need your trust.
You have mine.
I dol t understand why it's so hard for me to get yours.
That was good.
Is there a technique to that or were you just giving it a swift kick in the caboose?
Because if there's a technique, I wanna know it.
I've missed training with you.
I get it.
Chasing bad guys.
And with what's going on with Lena I'm sure it's...
I'm sure it's extra busy.
Are you going to tell me not to believe in her?
You believe in a lot of people that others don't.
Did you talk to James?
No, I'm actually talking about myself.
You know, you believing in me, it meant a lot.
And distant.
And I'd like to apologize for that.
Hey, I'm just glad to know that it's not me adjusting to Earth's chilly climate.
I was mad at you, because I thought you were dating Eve.
"Were," as in past tense.
She mentioned it.
Yeah.
You know, I'm not super hip on earthly social cues, but why would you be mad if I was dating Eve?
I'm not mad.
You literally just said you were mad.
No.
Two seconds ago, you said, "I am mad about..."
Yeah, I'm surprised.
You'd just date someone else, when you were serious about me, because I mean if...
How could you be serious if you did that?
I'm gonna go check and see if they've found Lena.
You're still angry I had Metallo liberate you from that jail?
It makes me look more guilty when I'm not.
Even if they found out the truth about you, no one would change their mind.
The public wants to believe the narrative they expect from us.
That Luthors are evil.
We don't get second chances.
Look what they did to me.
Stripped me of my medical license without even a hearing.
Or worse, what they did to Lex.
He could've fixed this planet for generations.
But Superman twisted what he was doing, and they all turned on him.
Lex went insane.
Exactly.
And if they could take the brightest mind on Earth and drive him crazy defending himself, imagine what they could do to you.
To what?
You have no life anymore, Lena.
You have no one on your side.
You're guilty, just like me.
You're on the run, just like me.
Join Cadmus.
And together we can do all the great things you ever dreamed of.
And with no Luthor men to divide us,
I can finally be the mother you always wanted.
Because I do love you.
Let me prove it to you now.
What is this place?
One of Lex's facilities.
A giant satellite receiver embedded in the top of this mountain monitors outer space for signs of intelligent life.
To warn of alien invasion?
Bingo!
Because we know more are coming.
Which makes me glad I joined the cause.
There's enough here to sustain us for a long time if we need it, but I suspect we won't.
Why not?
We're fugitives, we can't go back.
Not yet.
But your brother didn't only keep rations for times of emergency.
He also keo an arsenal.
Vaults around the world loaded with all the things he'd collected to level the playing field and defeat Superman once and for all.
And one of those vaults is right here.
Ready for authorization.
All we need is to open it.
It's a biometric lock.
It scans for Luthor DNA.
Tell me you don't have a bit of Lex frozen somewhere.
I didn't say Lex's DNA.
I said Luthor.
Any Luthor can open it.
And you, my daughter, are part of that family tree.
You didn't have your green goon liberate me from prison because you loved me.
Because you wanted to help me.
You did it because I'm the only one who can open this vault for you.
While it's true I need your DNA, one doesn't negate the other.
I still love you.
I still want to help you.
I promise it won't hurt.
The only person you want to help is yourself.
I'll take my chances on my own.
I think you should listen to your mother.
You're hurting me.
He doesn't want to, Lena.
Put your hand on the pad and we can all start getting along again.
I promise.
No.
I'm trying to play nice.
See?
That wasn't so bad, was it?
You know, the backseat driving, not helping.
Sorry.
But have you found anything yet?
I promise I will tell you.
Haven't you ever heard the phrase, "A watched pot never...".
Whoa, wait a second, I might be simmering.
What is it?
Okay, so I hacked into L-Corp CCTV to get a copy of the raw video footage of Lena taking the Kryptonite.
I know this code.
This is the same code the real Hank Henshaw used the day he broke into L-Corp to take the isotope.
Okay, okay, if the video was corrupted by Henshaw's cyborg signature, then I can reverse that signature and decrypt it and separate the raw video file from the corrupted one.
And...
You were right?
You were right.
Kryptonite signature detected.
What is it?
J'onn's been having me scan for Kryptonite signature, so we could find Metallo.
Have you found it, Agent Schott?
The ionizing radiation signature is breaking down at an exponential rate.
Kryptonite is normally the most stable of elements.
Well, James said Metallo's Kryptonite seemed off.
It could be synthetic.
That'd explain how they had it in the first place.
And it wasn't with Clark.
Have you finished repairing the anti-Kryptonite vest.
Supergirl wore the last time she fought Metallo?
I have to go now, or Lena's dead.
Kara, we calculated the rate of radioactive decay.
Kara, you have to turn back.
When the Kryptonite explodes, it's gonna send out a radioactive cloud of Kryptonite gas.
If you are anywhere near it, it'll kill you.
Then I'll make sure I'm not there when it goes off.
Well, this should make you feel safe.
Lex's warsuit, an Atomic Axe, a Black Mercy.
Everything we need to rid this planet of Kryptonians and every other alien invader, once and for all.
You're worse than Lex.
I promise you, I will be on the right side of history.
Maybe then you'll believe that I was looking out for your best interests, after all.
Whether you like it or not n I'll always be your mother.
My beautiful boy.
I had no idea...
You finished it.
Supergirl, I can't believe you're here.
Kara Danvers believes in you.
Supergirl, you're just in time.
I've been wondering if these worked.
Supergirl?
Well, that was easy.
You want to try more of these toys?
Don't hurt her!
Sorry, she's gotta pay for what her cousin did to your brother.
Lock Supergirl in the vault.
Supergirl, if you can still hear me,
Metallo's Kryptonite heart, the rate of decay is ticking up.
Metallo's heart is going to explode.
You all need to leave.
You have to get the Kryptonite out of him.
You're lying.
I'm not.
He's going to die.
The only one about to die is you.
Listen to me, the more Metallo uses the synthetic Kryptonite, the faster it's decaying.
It's time to leave.
Kara, the Kryptonite is almost critical.
Metallo, that pain in your chest.
Take it out, let me help you.
You're a liar.
Martian.
Get Lena, let's go.
Kara, please!
Supergirl, get out of there now!
Kara!
I'm not one to usually gloat or say, "I told you so." But...
It doesn't seem like I was the one with confirmation bias.
Yesterday she was guilty.
Today she's not.
It's not confirmation bias, Danvers, it's just the news game.
And since you've got enough time on your hands to stand around and look up at that TV, how about you get out there and get an exclusive on Lena Luthor?
This time, try to spell "exclusive" right.
Hey.
Any, um, any word on Lillian Luthor?
A satellite feed from the mountain showed a helicopter before the explosion.
But, no sign of her afterwards?
Lillian and Henshaw got away.
Yeah.
You were right.
About Lena Luthor.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.
You were just trying to protect me.
Yeah.
Just like you're always trying to protect me.
Can we just stop trying to protect each other and go back to being friends?
Because I really miss being friends.
Me, too.
Haven't had a game night in a while.
A game night sounds great.
Are you ever going to let me win though?
Deal.
It's a good article.
I'm learning to keep digging even when all the evidence points one way.
There's always another side.
Even when it's hard to find.
Especially when it's hard to find.
So, my office is overflowing with flowers.
You didn't have to do that.
Yeah, I did.
Supergirl told me that it was you who sent her.
I don't know how to thank you.
Well, that's what friends are for.
I've never had friends like you before.
Come to think of it, I've never had family like you.
No one has ever stood up for me like that.
Well, Supergirl may have saved me, but, Kara Danvers, you are my hero.
Check.
Checkmate.
I really like this game.
Maybe you are a Luthor after all.
Yeah, Yeah, I was, um, surprised you called after how you dashed out.
Yes, I wanted to apologize for that.
Because I should've answered your question.
Yeah, could've.
Could've, should've, would've.
It's not...
Yes, but I don't want to do that anymore.
With you.
See...
I can be strong, and stand my ground when I'm protecting someone else,
but when that someone is me...
It's a lot harder.
'Cause I don't like being vulnerable.
We're really different.
Yeah.
I'm, super fun.
And you're hyper-critical.
More like, you're an arrogant dude-bro and I'm the personification of the American way.
I'm sorry, and I'm arrogant?
That's not the point.
It's just...
Last year I thought I could have it all, and then I thought I couldn't.
Then I had to pick.
So, I chose being Supergirl over having a relationship.
And then, you came along,
and I thought you were... thoughtless and selfish.
And I kept writing you off.
And you kept proving me wrong.
And I just got me thinking...
Maybe I can have it all.
Hi.
Hi.
Darling!
Who the hell are you?
My name is Mr. Mxyzptlk.
And Kara Zor-El, I love you.
