Ah, the teachers of our youth.
They pushed us, inspired our minds, and made us who we are today.
And when those great teachers got sick, my mom stepped in to be a sub.
Bonjour, my little French fries.
By the time I'm done with you, you're going to be eating snails, not taking baths, and enjoying the silent art of mime.
Like most substitute teachers, she didn't know very much.
They're a weird people, hmm?
Then one day, everything changed.
My Mom saw the movie "Dead Poets Society."
When Robin Williams inspired those stuffy rich kids to stand on their desks, my mom saw her true calling.
Who knew Mork from Ork had such a serious side?
This movie proves that a sub is the most important person in a child's life.
Come Monday, that's just what I'm gonna do... inspire my kids.
You mean your students or your actual kids?
I'm sure they'll see it that way.
Good morning, class.
Uh, before we get started, does anyone need to make?
There's gonna be a lot of learning today, so if you got to make, do it now.
Anyone got to make poo-poos?
Stop!
All right, according to this memo from Principal Ball,
Mr. Gluckman has been checked into a rehab facility to address his relationship with cocaine.
"Please tell the students he has the flu."
I'll be your sub for the next 30 days.
We get to waste a whole month of critical learning that'll put us behind for years to come!
Aw, who's that handsome fella?
Question, Who here is familiar with the film "Dead Poets Society?"
Chill, dude.
Your mom's gonna show us a movie.
It's a classic sub move.
Oh, we're not watching it.
We're living it!
In fact, I need a volunteer chosen completely at random to come stand on my desk and view the world
She wants us to learn by standing on furniture?
Standing on a desk was how Robin Williams inspired his students.
Unfortunately, not everyone liked to see things from a different angle.
Whoa, whoa!
Dude, the hot sub told us to do it.
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?
It's the stuffy administration coming to clip my wings!
I fear nothing.
Like any great teacher, I encourage my students to seize the day!
Aah!
♪ I'm twisted up inside ♪
♪ But nonetheless, I feel the need to say ♪
♪ I don't know the future ♪
♪ But the past keeps getting clearer every day ♪
It was January 4, 1980-something, the day a single text message rocked my world.
Yo.
Get this note to Goldnerd for me.
Yep, back in the '80s, this was our version of sending a text.
You'd have to pass a note the old-fashioned way, by hand.
Only problem was, your messages weren't password-protected.
Mr. Goldberg, since that little paper is more important than life-saving CPR, maybe you'd like to stand and share it with the rest of us.
"Ballsssss."
To be clear...
I did not write this.
"Dude, when did Emmy Mirsky get so dang foxy?
I mean, holy boobs, Batman!
Look at those sweatshirt puppies."
Again, I did not write this.
Oh, that sucked.
My intention was to teach you a lesson about note-passing, but instead, I just made us all feel wildly uncomfortable.
Let's just move on to Chapter 6, okay?
Class dismissed.
Next time you get caught with a note, just do what a normal person does
My mom says it plugs up your bottom.
Small price to pay to avoid total humiliation.
I know, right?
I had to stand up in front of everyone and talk about my best friend's, you know, stuff.
Wait.
You thought that note was embarrassing for you?
Well, who else would it embarrass?
The note said you were hot.
You should be happy about it.
Are you serious right now?
Dork!
Boy, you really know your way around relationships with human beings.
I agree I'm flawed, but I honestly have no idea what I said wrong here.
Okay, I'm gonna shed some light on what it's like to be a freshman girl, and it ain't gonna be pretty.
The seniors called me "Frizzica Spazzberg."
Every 9th-grade girl, no matter how she looks, feels uncomfortable in her own skin.
There's a hunk of lettuce in your braces.
How did you not feel it?
I was going through a salad phase!
My point is, Emmy just needs a friend who understands how she feels.
Seriously, though, there's like a whole head of romaine in there.
I am gonna give you one second to walk away.
1!
As I was learning how to be a better friend, my mom was teaching Barry how to be a better student.
I don't understand!
This is my house, not my school.
Now that I have the teaching tools I learned in a movie,
I will not rest until you get an "A" in this class.
Okay, now, the atomic symbol "C"
stands for what?
It stands for Carbon.
But it also stands for chemistry, so half a point?
The answer is not farts!
Science makes no sense, and I don't need it!
Especially 'cause I'm gonna marry Kathy Ireland.
I'm gonna be her lazy mooch of a husband who lives in her mansion in Ireland!
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go brush up on my Irish culture and... find me gold at the end of the rainbow, mon.
Well, that accent was definitely Jamaican.
Boopie, don't give up!
Mama believes in you!
You're a substitute teacher.
Just give the boy a damn "A" already.
We got to get that moron into some sort of college.
Can you believe this, Dad?
Okay, you really want him to buckle down?
Let me go upstairs and get his ass in gear.
By yelling at him and calling him a moron?
Barry needs inspiration.
All I need to do is unlock his potential, and then the sky's the limit.
His many limits are the limit.
His answer was "farts."
That day, I was also on a mission to prove to Emmy I felt her pain.
All right, hormonal disasters!
It's time to pick teams!
Shirts, Skins, Shirts, Skins,
Okay, so why exactly did we cut math to sit in on some random gym class?
What you're witnessing is a barbaric practice known as "Shirts vs. Skins."
Nothing is worse than having to awkwardly disrobe
I know!
I mean, why not shorts vs. pants?
or red shirts vs. blue shirts?
Sure, it would take some planning the night before, but I could get a phone tree going.
I mean, we are not the same.
Do you wear thick, baggy-ass clothes when it's 90 degrees out to hide your body?
I thought you wear that 'cause you love Epcot.
'Cause it's like taking a trip around the world without leaving the safe confines of Orlando?
Being a Skin in gym is nothing compared to being stared at all day.
Well, if you think about it, my thing's actually way worse 'cause at least you get to cover up with bulky fabrics.
You're a douche lord!
Hey, Bar, how's studying with Mom going?
She's really teaching you science stuff?
Let's just say Mom is gonna be very pleased with my answers.
Pops, give us a taste.
Question 1.
"What is the chemical symbol for sodium?"
And my answer?
"My mommy is the best mommy ever of all mommies on Planet Mommy."
Nailed it!
What the hell are you doing, you moron?
Just giving the lady the answers she always wanted to hear.
Pops, what's the atomic weight of chloride?
"Wittle Barry-wary like Mummy's snuggy-wuggies."
Okay, this is just nonsense.
And with that, my dad knew it was time to inspire Barry in his own way.
Look, I hate to tell you this, but your mom is looking for any excuse to fail you.
Mom telling you to study is just a trick, because she knows you never do what she says.
I do don't do that!
She really wants you to fail so you don't graduate.
And no college means you live here forever.
And that means she picks out your clothes for the rest of your life.
But I want Kathy Ireland to pick out my clothes for the rest of my life.
Well, I hope she enjoys sharing a family bathroom.
I don't know what to tell you.
Mom will not control me.
I will learn all chemistry...
No, all science!
Time for me to tear off this plastic shrink-wrap and get to learning.
But the year is half-over.
And that, my friend, is how you truly inspire a kid.
All you did was use his mother as a weapon to rile him up.
I do it all the time.
It's how I got Erica to learn piano,
Adam to ice skate.
I just tell them that their mom is holding them back.
You do know that if Bev finds out about this, she'll never forgive you.
No doubt.
It had been days since Emmy talked to me, so I decided to recruit someone who spoke her language.
Okay, before you throw a hard object at me
I have a big favor to ask and will pay a huge sum of money to do it.
I'm listening.
I need you to give this note to Emmy and make her read it.
She's still not talking to you, huh?
Honestly, she's being crazy and irrational, but as you can see in this note,
I'm the bigger man and still willing to apologize.
"Dear Emmy, you're being crazy and irrational.
Let me explain the many reasons why your super-silly female body issues are all in your head." No.
Exactly how much money are we talking here?
$1,000.
Which is what this Megatron will be worth on the black market in 30 years.
I'll do it if you just go away now.
And so my sister would help me, but not by going to Emmy.
Kind of busy, female Goldberg.
I'm inventing a new hybrid sport.
Either, uh, baseball fencing or water-polo squash.
You can't play squash under water.
That makes sense.
"Need... to... breathe".
Uh-huh.
So, my brother's been a bad friend to Emmy Mirsky.
Ah, stabbed in the back by her best amigo.
That is a crime worse than all the murders in the world.
I don't think that's right, but sure.
So, could you help her by blatantly abusing your authority?
You want old Coach to exact sweet revenge, huh?
No problem.
While Erica was looking to teach me a lesson,
Barry was ready to learn.
I need you to teach me everything about chemistry so I can get an "A."
Are you sure you want to join us, bro?
Yeah, you tend to just sort of peter out, insult us, and then leave us high and dry.
Not this time, my tiny friend I can fit in my pocket!
You mean memorizing?
It takes more than just glancing at our note cards to know what elements are in Group Four of the Periodic Table.
Titanium, Zirconium, Hafnium, and Rutherfordium.
Indeed, Geoffrey.
And I will use that potential to stop my mom's evil plan.
And he did.
Barry was so psyched to teach my mom a lesson, he couldn't stop teaching himself.
Well, look at you guys studying.
Just tutoring my boys.
They're having a hard time keeping up.
Keeping up... with you?
Turns out science just kind of clicks when I try.
Barry's even read four chapters ahead for fun.
Until we read that far into the book.
Thanks to you telling me about Mom's awful plan to keep me here to love me forever.
You're really showing her.
Uh, just maybe you keep your rage-learning between us.
But what's the point of knowledge if you don't use it to destroy your mother?
You know what would really stick it to her?
If you tell her after you got into college.
Yeah.
Imagine how miserable she'll be when I go off to Harvard.
You'll destroy her for sure.
But until then, let's just keep it our secret.
Our wonderful secret.
As my dad was trying to keep Barry quiet,
I was just trying to keep my shirt on.
Shirt, Skin, Shirt, Skin, Shirt, Skin, Shirt.
Skin.
Skin.
This better be important, Goldfarb!
I did double-Skin.
But you can't double-Skin.
It's Shirt, Skin, Shirt, Skin.
I can Skin-Skin anytime I like.
Maybe now you'll know what it feels like to be a young girl coming of age!
Wait, is this about Emmy?
The best teachers never reveal if it's about Emmy.
So it is about Emmy!
You should have just eaten the note.
Everybody eats the note!
Just for the back-talk, you're a skin
Now you're a Skin for the rest of the year!
You keep it up, you'll be a Skin for life!
You can't do that.
Trust me, On your wedding day, you will walk down the aisle shirtless.
No respectable venue would allow that!
It'll be a beach wedding!
That sounds wonderful... and like my worst nightmare.
That was when I realized the person I'd enlisted to help me only made it worse.
You did this!
You said you wanted my help, so I'm helping you.
I meant talk to her and make everything better for me.
Instead, you got Mellor all riled up!
You know he riles easily!
I wasn't just gonna bail you out.
Do you know how hard it was for me to be Frizzica?
I used to eat lunch in the bathroom stalls.
I'd take the back hallways to avoid boys.
I even spent Saturday nights at home watching the news with Dad.
He yells so much at the news.
It's like he thinks they can hear him!
But you want to know the worst part?
Is I had no one to talk to about any of it.
But you're only thinking about yourself instead of being there for her.
You'll have to catch me first!
I'm athletic when determined.
I'm a Skin.
It's Barry's chemistry test, and guess what?
He aced it!
Or should I say, I aced him!
Guess you did, huh?
No, you said I couldn't "Captain" him,
Attention, people in the room.
I have a huge announcement about my future that I need to rub in my mother's face.
I couldn't wait for Harvard to beg me to join their ranks.
Wait, did I hear "Harvard"?
I think I heard "Harvard."
Oh, you heard it.
Thanks to my newfound love of sciences,
I've officially decided what to do with my life.
I shall be a doctor.
Not the Jenkintown Posse.
I'm talkin' about the Jenkintown Practice, an all-in-one medical facility where I'll be C.E.O. and lead surgeon.
I'm the in-house ophthalmologist.
I'm the foot doc, y'all!
And I'ma play drums in the waiting room.
I cannot believe what I'm hearing!
Tell me more!
What'chu have to say about that?
This is the happiest fucking day of my fucking life!
'Cause I inspired you to learn!
But I thought you secretly wanted me to fail.
Of course not.
Uh, who would give you such a nasty idea?
Maybe we should go.
What the hell's happening here?
Ooh, I'd like to stay and quietly watch.
I may have slightly motivated the kid using you as a springboard for his hate.
My mom genuinely wants me to thrive?
It's all built on lies!
I fully reject science and all learning!
I'm sorry, JTP.
We're no longer the JTP.
We're just the JTP.
JTP.
Bevy, I only wanted to help the kid succeed.
To quit.
I'm no teacher.
And the worst part is, the only thing I inspired in my son is resentment.
I had messed up with Emmy, and it would take a miracle to fix our friendship...
Fresh hottie, 9:00.
Nice rack.
Sorry.
Allergies.
In that moment, I finally saw how hard it was for Emmy, and I knew just what I had to do, even if it killed me.
Not be confused with the other Adam Goldberg.
He's more of a multi-hyphenate.
I've been focusing on the written word.
What the hell is your problem, dorknard?
I just heard you talking about my friend here.
No, it's not!
I mean, how would you feel if every time you walked through school, the girls talked about your body?
I'd nod and say, "This saddle seats one.
Unless you're a twin, then it seats two."
Point is, maybe we should just be more sensitive.
It's hard enough to be a freshman hoping you can fit in.
I'm hoping you can fit in that trash can.
Not the trash!
That's where Nurse Steve dumps all the old Band-Aids.
I sit behind you in Spanish.
Next siesta you take in class, snip-snip, you lose the ponytail.
But that's where my soul resides.
Come on, man.
She's turning the tables on us, and I don't like it.
Well, you're a tough girl.
It may take you a few years, but you'll get there.
Trust me.
Are you crazy?
You almost got trashed!
I just figured I should be there for you, no matter how hard it gets.
Thanks a lot.
Now I'm crying at school 'cause you're such a dumb, great friend.
The dumbest.
Yep, growing up is an awkward adventure, but with a little understanding, we can help each other get through the rough spots.
Hey.
Please don't make a big deal out of this.
You also just saved it.
I'm gonna hug you again.
Sometimes, we're so consumed with our own problems, we can't see what other people are going through until we open our eyes and our hearts.
Dude!
Knock first!
What'd you put under the mattress?
Magazine.
Dirty kind with lady parts.
Physics?
Fine.
Look, I love science.
I'm good at it, and I feel ashamed.
Well, don't.
Look, it was wrong to use your mother against you, but now we know how much you can do if you actually try.
She believed in you the whole time.
I guess she is a good teacher.
And she's also a damn-good mother.
And maybe it wouldn't hurt if you let her know.
I'm your substitute sub, which means study hall for a month!
Wait!
Mom!
And in me.
I said sit down, Mr. Goldberg!
What'd I say about standing on the desks?
Everybody down!
Dude, they're sticking it to Mellor by standing on school property!
I'm king of whatever class this is!
This school sucks!
Screw you, Dad!
Rush rules!
I will never die!
Turns out, Beverly Goldberg was way more than just a substitute teacher.
She was permanent inspiration.
My baby's gonna be a doctor.
Eh, I'll believe that when I see it.
_
_
I am so proud and happy.
Now that he's gonna be going to medical school,
I cried like a baby.
Because that means for another four years, he'll still be out of the house and we can keep the room neat.
And that is how you perform CPR on a man.
Whoa, Mr. Goldberg, what is that you have there?
Is that another note?
I know mine's old Glascott.
Did you know he's in a funk fusion band called Funk and Games?
I heard he's playing at the farmer's market this weekend."
