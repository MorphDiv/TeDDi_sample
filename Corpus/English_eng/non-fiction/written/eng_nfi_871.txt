Run away, it's...
Dr. Najib?
And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling kids.
Hey, I might have caught ya.
Ah, you're right, I'm pretty bad at my job.
Thanks, meddling kids.

Man, oh, man.
Like, I don't know about you guys, but I sure wouldn't mind going someplace fun and sunny.
How long have we been in this stuffy old museum anyhow, two weeks?
Three weeks?
It's been two days.
Huh, seemed longer.
What do you say, guys?
Let's go somewhere fun and unwind.
I can't think of any place more fun than right here at the Museum of Archeology.
I, for one, found the display on Aztec agriculture amazing.
Velma, that's good.
"Maize" is what the Aztecs called corn.
Yeah, it was the "corn" er stone of Aztec agriculture.
It's lucky we're here, 'cause that joke belongs in a museum.
I'm with Shaggy.

If you kids are looking for someplace fun to go, the annual Blowout Beach Bingo Bash just started.
It's three fun-filled days of singing, dancing, games and food.
- Food!

Sure.
They end the whole thing with a giant beach barbecue where they crown the two most high- spirited partiers Captains of the Bash.
Yeah, let's all go.
Sure, I'd be up for...
Wait a second, you almost got me.
I should not be in this line of work.
Well, gang, looks like we're off to the Blowout Beach Bingo Bash.
Yay!
Could we turn the music down?
I'm trying to read the guidebook to Blowout Beach.
Who needs a guidebook for a beach?
There's sand and water and, uh...
And that's it.
Not so, there's the historic boardwalk, a thriving downtown music scene and a newly built pier amusement area.
There's actually quite a bit to do.
I'm going to draw up a schedule to optimize our fun once we get there.
You can't optimize fun, Velma.
You just have fun.
I beg to differ.
We've already missed half a day.
If we're going to cram three days of fun into two and a half days, it's going to require some tight scheduling.
Good thinking, Velma.
You know, schedules are one of my favorite types of plans.
Right up there with blueprints and building instructions.
Oh, man.
Like, you guys are squares and a couple of two-by-two bricks.
- Hey!

We are fun.
Why, just last week I took us all to that amusement park.
That was a creepy, abandoned amusement park.
Filled with vampire clowns.
What about the week before that, when I was like,
"Hey, guys, let's go to the zoo."
Creepy, abandoned, and there was a giant, zombie polar bear.
Face it, you two, you just don't like to have fun like other people like to have fun.
You'd rather be solving a mystery.
Like, it's not your fault you guys are totally obsessed with creepy mysteries.
We are not obsessed with mysteries.
You named your van the Mystery Machine.
You guys just can't resist the spooky stuff.
Just like how Scoob and I can't resist a cheeseburger.
- Or pizza.

Or a triple decker sandwich.
- With extra pickles.

Oh, man, I'm getting super hungry here.
What was the point I was trying to make?
Sandwiches taste good?
No, that wasn't it...

You two are no fun.
Not true, we have fun.
We have lots of fun.
Oh yeah?

Oh!

Like, I rest my case.
We'll prove we can be just as fun as you guys.
- Yeah...

Yeah?

You'll see.

♪ Come on, let the sun in ♪
♪ Ain't no sense in running ♪
♪ The beach is where they'll be ♪
♪ It's no mystery to me ♪
♪ The sand and surf are waiting ♪
♪ Boardwalk ripe for skating ♪
♪ The place I want to be It's no mystery to me ♪

♪ Come on, let the sun in ♪

♪ The beach is where I'll be it's no mystery to me ♪
Uh-oh, I'm getting a very creepy and abandoned feeling from this place.
Everyone is probably down at the boardwalk.
According to my guidebook, during the Bash the boardwalk is party central.
Maybe there's another boardwalk.
Where did everybody go?
They must have sensed Fred and Velma's party pooper vibes and left town.
Ha-ha, very funny.
Come on, let's check in to the hotel.
Then we can catch up with the party and prove we can have a good time.
Pardon me, my fellow carefree, fun-loving teens.
Uh, we're looking for the Bingo Bash.
The Bash is over, Daddy-O, we're splitting.
You cats should split, too, if you know it's good for you.
I wonder what spooked them.
- Probably the pirates.

Calm down, fellas, I'm sure he's just joking.
Nope, no joke.
How do you do, Rob Holdout.
And this my lovely wife, Laura Holdout.
As owners of this fine establishment and all the attractions you see on the boardwalk, allow me to welcome you to the Holdout Inn.
Ah, thank you.
Sorry, but did you say those teens were scared off by pirates?
Pirates ransacked the pier this morning.
Chased everyone off.

My goodness, the entire bowl?
We need two rooms, please.
Oh, I'm sorry, but we've only got one available room.
You're in luck!

You know, it is so nice to see young people undeterred by the threat of ferocious ghost pirates.
Excuse me?
I'd like to take a second to confer with my associate, please.
Scooby-Doo, old pal, did she just say what I think she said?
"Ferocious ghost pirates?"
That's what I thought.
- Well.

Vacation over, boy, am I relaxed.
- Back to the Mystery...

Ghost pirates, you say?

Control yourself, Velma.
You are not here to investigate, you are here for one reason and one reason alone.
That's right.
We're gonna be crowned Captains of the Bash.
Ah, well, isn't that nice?
You know, our kids Chad and Krissy were last year's captains.
Great, maybe they could give us some tips on maximizing our fun in the most efficient way to party down in the group setting.
Uh, maybe.
The only thing is, there aren't going to be any captains this year, hon.
- What?

The ghost pirates stole the hats they used to crown the captains.
Were the hats valuable?
No, they're just regular old pirate hats.
But you can't have captains without them.
- It's tradition.

So then maybe the pirates stole them to stop the Bash.
I thought you said no investigating.
Well, this is different.
We've to get those pirate hats back if Fred and I are going to be Captains of the Bash.
Excuse you, we are the Captains of the Bash.
Krissy, Chad.
These nice young teens are just checking in.
Would you like to show them to their rooms?
- As if.

Okay, well, this young lady had some questions about, uh, maximum and official group settings and, uh...
She wanted tips on being fun.
She looks like she could use them.
Nice ascot.
Chadwick Martin Holdout, that is no way to talk to a guest.
Whatever, Pops.
We're going to the Octo Rock Lounge and you can't stop us.
Later.
What's "SD" stand for?
Strange Dog?
Those two were crowned the most fun partiers at the Bash?
Fred, Velma, you guys might have a shot at this.
You'll have to excuse them.
They've had a pretty bad attitude since they were voted captains.
Those dang hats really went to their heads.
Maybe it's not so bad that the pirates stole them.
Can you tell us a little bit more about the ghost pirates?
Sure, that's them.

- Ghost pirates!

Oh, it's just a painting.
I recognize those two from my guidebook.
That's the pirate queen Bonnie Bingo Belle and Captain Brutimore Bash.
The Bingo Bash is named after them.
And behind them is the Salty Brick, the most feared ship to ever sail the seas.
They even have a lady tied to the front.
That particular figurehead is the Roman goddess Aurora.
And that skull and crossbones is what they call a "Jolly Roger".
Say, would you kids like to hear about the very first Blowout Beach Bingo Bash?
You see, it was way back in pirate time...
Oh, Rob, you are not going to bore our guests with a history lesson.
Rob's sort of the town's amateur historian.
Well, now, they don't mind, do you?
Well, we really should be partying.
But I suppose we have time to squeeze in a little history.
That's the spirit.
Now, like I was saying, it was way back in pirate times.
The pirate queen, Bonnie Bingo Belle and her partner, Captain Brutimore Bash, were the two most famous pirates around.
They had just plundered a ship belonging to the super wealthy Duchess Ducheeseslob, and decided to hide out for a while at Blowout Beach, which, at the time, was a notorious safe haven for pirates, rapscallions, scallywags, lowlifes,
privateers, smugglers and just all-around bad guys.
Yes, sir, they owned this town.
In fact, the smugglers even built secret tunnels all over Blowout Beach to smuggle their goods.
Oh, now, Rob, they don't need to know all that.
Just get to the Bingo Bash part.
Honey, I was just about to.
No, you were talking too much.
It's a story dear, the whole point
- is talking.

Every time.
Every time I start talking...
Oh, it's not every time.
- You start up...

...with "Rob, you talk too much."
Oh, is that supposed to be me?
- Do you wanna tell the story?

- Fine.

Bingo Belle and Captain Bash sailed into port, their ship full of treasure.
Well, anyhow they were so happy with all their new riches that they threw a giant party that lasted three days.
It was the first Blowout Beach Bingo Bash.
Oh, you see, on the third day, a navy warship, the Gilded Cod, under the command of the dashing Commodore Ducheeseslob...
The duchess's nephew.
Commodore Ducheeseslob sailed into Blowout Beach and ambushed the pirates.
They arrested Bingo Belle and Captain Bash.
But, as it turned out, it wasn't
Bingo Belle and Captain Bash at all.
It was just two teenagers Belle and Bash had given their hats to in order to fool the Commodore.
Those were the first teens crowned Captains of the Bash.
May I continue?
As soon as the Commodore realized his mistake,
Belle and Bash, aboard the Salty Brick, sailed into the harbor, opened fire on the beach and sunk the Gilded Cod.
What they didn't anticipate, however, was that waiting for them in the harbor were even more navy warships under the command of Admiral Ducheeseslob.
The duchess's uncle.
The admiral confiscated the Salty Brick and arrested all the pirates aboard, except for Belle and Bash.
In all the chaos, they and the treasure disappeared.
Never to be seen again.
There they are, Officers, arrest them.
Sheriff, what's this about?
Mr. Monkfish is alleging that you two are responsible for that pirate attack earlier.
A pretty cheap stunt, trying to chase away all my customers on the busiest weekend of the year.
Hello, Dwight Monkfish.
I own the pier at Blowout Beach.
It's the big wooden thing sticking out into the ocean.
Perhaps, you've seen it?
We're Mystery Incorporated.
Oh, is that your band name?
Well, when you get tired of this rundown dump you should come by.
We're always looking for fresh, young musical acts down at the pier.
You can work for tips.
Now look here, Monkfish.
Who do you think you are, coming in here accusing us of crimes?
Calling our cozy inn a "dump".
I call 'em like I sees 'em.
Just look at this place, loose bricks everywhere.
You gotta press these things together firmly.
It's disgraceful.
Hey!

Besides, you've been trying to get us to sell our property to you since you came to town, you pompous moustache twirler.
Why, I'd rather see the boardwalk destroyed than sell it you.
Yeah, how do we know it wasn't you responsible for that pirate attack?
Oh, oh, that's rich.
Me, sabotaging my own business the day before I open my brand-new roller coaster.
It's called the Blowout Blizzard.
You'll love it, it goes up, down, around, you name it.
It's even got a loop.
Mitzi, what are you standing around for?
Give these kids some free passes for the grand opening tomorrow.
Except for him, no dogs allowed.
How rude.
So you're not arresting them?

But I'm watching you.
Come on, Mitzi, what are you standing around for?
We've got things to do.
- It was nice meeting you.

Sorry to bother you, folks.
Hmm, I'm gonna catch up with the Sheriff for a second.
Well, that vacation lasted about two seconds.
You know, Sheriff, my friends and I are mystery solvers.
Mystery solvers?

No, we solve mysteries.
If there is anything we can do to help your investigation...
"Investigation?"
It was probably just some local teens blowing off some steam.
All they did was take a couple of old hats and chase away some obnoxious out-of-towners like yourselves.
Frankly, this is usually a nice sleepy beach town, so now with Monkfish trying to make this a year-round vacation spot, well, my deputy and I wouldn't mind if those pirates did put an end to the Bash and all the annoying tourists, like yourselves,
that it attracts.
What did he say?
Gang, it's time to investigate.
Velma, you got any leads?
I sure do.
Daphne, you go investigate the pier.
Talk to that Dwight Monkfish.
See what you can find out.
Shaggy and Scooby, according to my guidebook
Bingo Belle and Captain Bash's ship, the Salty Brick, is still docked in the harbor as a historical exhibit.
Why don't you go check it out?
Like, forget that.
There's ghost pirates running around and you want us to go check out their boat?
You guys weren't actually scared by those ghost stories, were you?
Not scared.
Terrified!
That's too bad.
According to my guidebook, the Salty Brick has an excellent snack bar.
- Snacks?

It says here they've got nachos, French fries, chicken wings, popcorn shrimp, and deep-fried Scooby snacks.
We'll catch you landlubbers later, we've got a bus to catch!
And on the starboard side, you'll see more portholes.
The term "porthole" applies whether they are on the portside of the ship or the starboard side.
There are 36 portholes on this ship, each one with its own unique story.
How could they turn something as scary as a pirate ship into something so boring?
Please save your questions for the end of the tour.
Like, excuse me, Mr. Museum Guide dude.
Like, do you think that we can stop by the snack bar?
Oh, no, we replaced that with an exhibit on barrels.
But don't worry, we'll get to that later.
No snacks?
If you don't mind, we'd like to abandon ship.
Out of consideration for all our other guests,
- I can't lower the gangplank...

...for you to leave until after the tour.
Now, if there are no further interruptions, we still have four more hours on this tour.
Four hours?
I don't think my stomach's is gonna make it that long, Scoob.
Let's see if there's anything to eat in the ship's galley.
There are 42 different and fascinating uses for a porthole.
Number one...
So, this is the local teen rock and roll club?
It's quieter than I thought it would be.
Nice.
I guess everyone's nerves are still recovering from the pirate attack.
Well, maybe as the future Captains of the Bash, it's up to us to get the party going.
Ahoy, maties!
No, no, no, no, no.
We're not pirates.
Just a couple of freewheeling teenagers such as yourselves.
Maybe tone down the pirate speak, Captain.
And let's try engaging a smaller group.
Hey, fellas.

"Trap?"
Actually it's about a snare trap, to be specific.
- Maybe later.

It's Chad and Krissy, we should go say hi.
Hey, Chad, Krissy, fancy meeting you two here.
- Do we know you?

Less than an hour ago, you wouldn't show us to our rooms.
You made fun of his ascot and insulted our dog.
Oh yeah, Strange Dog.
- Can we help you?

Oh, no, when I said, "Can we help you?"
I meant it more like, uh...
- Go away.

- Look, chum...

Ah, right.
Listen, if we did something to offend you, I'm sorry.
But we were just wondering if you could tell us anything about the pirate attack earlier.
I understand the pirates took the hats right off your darling...
Um...
I'm sorry, what's that?
Shoo, fly, don't bother us.
Come on, Fred, let's go.
You know, you two are decidedly unjinky.
"Jinky."
What a couple of...
Corn dogs, now I know what you're thinking.
You can get corn dogs down at the boardwalk.
But these aren't any old, normal, run-of-the-mill boardwalk corn dogs, no.
These are infused with, uh...
Wasa, uh, wasalami, wasatoosie, wasa-matter-you...
Mitzi, what's that stuff called?
- Wasabi, sir.

How's that for a classic gourmet experience?
I want to transform this sleepy old town into "the" destination for the young and well-to-do.
And it begins by bulldozing that ugly old beach and boardwalk down there and turning the whole thing into piers.
You want to turn the whole town into piers?
You hear that inflection in her voice, Mitzi?
It is the sound of resistance, of complacency, of a no-can-do attitude.
Yes, sir.
Piers, Ms. Blake, are the future.
The ocean levels are rising up and piers will be there to meet them.
My piers.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to a photoshoot for Modern Pier Owner magazine.
They're putting me on the cover.
Ms. Capaletto can answer any further questions you may have.
Piers!
Wow, the cover.
He must be well-respected in the pier-owning community.
Mr. Monkfish owns Modern Pier Owner magazine.
He's on every cover.
Oh, I see.

"Mitzi." My friends call me Mitzi.
Because it's my first name.
Mitzi, did you witness the pirate attack this morning?
I did.
They were just like Mr. Holdout used to describe them.
- Mr. Holdout?

No, Mr. Holdout used to describe the pirates?
Oh yes, he used to give the tours of the Salty Brick when I was a kid.
He had to stop after he hurt his leg in that bumper car accident.
Oh, what happened?
Another bumper car just hit him and drove off.
Mr. Holdout used to love telling us about the missing treasure.
I still remember the poem he used to recite.
Poem?
- Where?

Oh, yes.
You see, they never did find Belle or Bash.
But the parrots they kept aboard the Salty Brick used to repeat this poem about the treasure.
Could I hear it?
Let me see now.
"If ye be looking to get rich quick
"then climb aboard the Salty Brick.
"Go on bow, tip our hats
"respect great treasure
"and at the dawn, shake hands for good measure."
Hmm, so this morning did the pirates mention the missing treasure?
No.
They just stole the hats off Chad and Krissy and then chased everyone off.
They said the Bash was over.
Do you know where Mr. Monkfish was during all this?
I know what you're thinking.
It wasn't him.
I know he comes off as brash, arrogant, a little short-tempered, gross, slimy, pure evil and the lowest kind of scum, but he isn't all bad.
I think in his own way he really cares about this town and its people.
What are you doing, makeup?
I have very sensitive skin, you dolt!
You wouldn't know anything about that.
You have the coarse skin of someone destined for failure.
Like all the other losers in this one-pier town.
You're fired!

Give me that, I'll do it myself.
That's right, work it, yup, you're an animal.
I love business!
How are we going to be named Captains of the Bash when the bash is more of a bust?
We just have to figure out a way to get this party started up again.
Now, what's something that regular non-mystery solving teenagers enjoy?
Ah!

May be the gang was right about us.
Let's go catch up with them.
Jinkies!
Say, that's one crazy dance move.
What's it called?
Oh, no, I wasn't doing a dance.
It's called the Jinky.
What?
These cool teens were impressed by your new dance.
Oh, that.
Yes, it's a pretty popular move where we come from.
Oh, where's that?
Uh...

Upper Cooltown.
Sounds cool.
Say, do you think you could show us how to do the Jinky?
Oh, I, I guess.
Gather around, everyone, there's a hip new dance you gotta see.
Hey, Tentacles, play something with a beat.

Yeah, you are sorry.
And so is your lame new dance.
- Lamoid.

More like the Jerky.
Hey, what's your problem?
She said she was sorry, we're just trying to have fun.
It is so sad what passes for fun these days.
Come on, everybody, let's ditch these weirdos and go someplace cool.
Um, why are you all just standing there?
Your Bash Captains are leaving.
So leave, you two have been major bummers for way too long.
- Whatever, it's lame in here.

When you losers realize how uncool this is, come find us.
And we might forgive you.
How did those two become last year's Captains of the Bash?
Who knows?
Hit it, Tentacles.
What kind of pirate ship doesn't have a kitchen?
Like, "arrr" you kidding me?
- Everyone's a critic.

Like, we better find some food quickly.
The sound of my stomach growling is making me lose
- my appetite.

Arrr!
On second thought, maybe there's some food above deck.
Like on land.
Far, far away from here.
Like, in a different country.
Yikes!
Looks like we've got a couple of stowaways.
Like, we were just leaving.
- Right, Scoob?

I'm already gone.
And that is all 42 uses for a porthole.
Which brings us, of course, to the cousin of the porthole, the gun port.
Quick, Scoob, pull some of those cannons over here and we'll barricade the door.
No touching.
- Scoob!

This tour is already in progress.
If you'd like a tour, you'll have to come back for our next tour.
Another fascinating use for portholes.
Welcome, ghost pirates, to another episode of This Old Ship, the show that takes moldy old ships and transforms them into stylish, modern sailing vessels.
What be all this now?
This old ship needs a total interior design overhaul.
Scoob, what are you thinkin'?
Hmm...
Open concept.
You took the words right out of my mouth!
Try, if you will, to picture our vision.
We start by adding a few more portholes along this wall, give it a light, airy feel.
Moving on, we were thinking we could paint this wall over here a fun color.
Yeah, really make it pop!
And, of course, we just want to lose this wall entirely and open up the space.
What do you think?
That would really improve the flow to the bow of the ship.
Exactamundo.
So now that we're all on the same page with the design, let's start demo!
As the boat owner, I'll let you take the very first swing, big guy.
Thank you.

Fred?

Hey, Daph!

The what?
The Jinky!
Daphne, I want you to meet Brenda and Tommie.
They're the jinkiest.
Daphne rolls in our crew.
Far out!
Any friend of Vel and the Fredman is su casa, you dig?
"Crew?" "Fredman?"
- Fun, right?

I wanted to talk to you guys.
I think I found some clues down at the pier.
Oh no, you don't!
We're having fun.
Yeah.

"Clues can wait"?
Who are you?
I'm Vel from Cooltown, and according to my calculations, it's time to get funky!
Have you guys found anything out here?
Or have you just been dancing this whole time?
There'll be time to investigate after we're crowned Captains of the Bash.
No, there won't.

Daph, do you mind?

Yeah, you're being a total Fred.
You're Fred!
Like, we have major problems.
Where's Fred and Velma?
You mean Fredman and Vel?
They're out on the dance floor.
I think maybe we teased them a little too hard.
It's like all they care about now is fun.
Like, I don't blame 'em.

You'll never guess who we ran into at the Salty Brick.
- The pirates!

- That's right.

No, behind you!
The pirates!
Zoinks!
Arrr!

Arrr!
Arrr!
Where'd the pirates go?
Who cares?

Brenda and Tommie are gone, too!
Well, maybe if Shaggy and Scooby hadn't led the pirates right to the club...
Like, no way, man!

How could they have sailed the ship away and shown up minutes later at the Octo Rock Lounge?
Oh, now you start investigating?
Maybe if you two hadn't been so caught up in trying to prove you could be fun, we could have saved your friends.
Well, if we'd been busy investigating, they wouldn't have been our friends!
What's all the commotion?
I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Holdout.
We're just upset about those pirates.
Well, you're not gonna get anywhere by squabbling.
Teamwork, that's the key, if you want to solve your little case of the missing hats.
That's right.
I'm afraid the case is bigger than just missing hats now.
It's expanded to two missing teens.
And, like, one boat-napped boat!
Two missing teens?
- That's impossible.

The pirates ran off with Tommie and Brenda at the Octo Rock Lounge tonight.
The Octo Rock Lounge, eh?
I'll let the Sheriff know.
Why don't we walk you kids to your rooms?
Cookies?
Like, man, if I never set foot on that boat again, it'll be too soon.
Yeah.
I've never been so bored and so terrified at the same time!
Bored?

I understand you used to lead tours of the Salty Brick, Mr. Holdout.
Oh yes, way back when before... the accident.
Is that Belle and Bash's parrot?
It sure is.
His name was Aloysius Featherton Scourgebottom Wendellwing Crackers IV.
Try saying that three times fast.
Aloysius Featherton Scourgebottom Wendellwing Crackers IV.
Aloysius Featherton Scourgebottom Wendellwing Crackers IV.
Aloysius Featherton Scourgebottom Wendellwing Crackers IV.
All right, I guess it's not so hard after all.
Do you remember the parrot's poem you used to recite on your tours?
Oh, that?

If you kids don't mind, it's getting late, and we really should be getting to bed.
Yeah, besides, Velma and I need to get up early.
We're competing in the Bingo Bash Limbo Contest.
How can you two be thinking about a limbo contest?
People are missing!
Yeah, like, how low can you go?
Well, you two are just jealous that Velma and I are better at having fun than you.
Think after all the heavy lifting Fred and I do on every...
You two are behaving like a couple of spoiled children.
How about that Daphne getting on our case out there?
Well, I don't know, Fred.

You too?
Oh!

All I'm saying is you can be fun and responsible at the same time.
- Right, Scoob?

Sometimes you have to take responsibility, and I know that's a big word, dude, but responsibility is what you need.
Daphne, I...
We were just trying to show that we know how to party down.
You were supposed to be investigating.
Now your friends are missing and we don't have any clues to go on.
How can you and Fred be so unconcerned about this?
You wouldn't understand.
Dancing tonight, I felt fun.
I just wanted that feeling to last a little longer before I go back to deductive, rational, party-pooping old Velma.
Oh, yeah?

- Fine.

Come on, Scoob.

Scooby-Doo?
Like, Scooby-Doo, where are you?
- Over here!

I'm in here.
Whoa!
Huh?
Huh?
You guys aren't Scooby!
How did we ever get by without your brilliant powers of observation?
Ha-ha.

Back here!
These must be the tunnels the smugglers built back when the city was a safe haven for pirates.
Neato.

- I don't know.

You guys aren't going to give up exploring secret tunnels for a silly limbo contest, are you?
Like, a limbo contest doesn't even make sense!
Where's the competition?
We all bend at exactly the same height.
You guys coming or what?
- Okay.

Do you guys hear that?
It's coming from over here.
And yet, you're both rude.

The way you've been treating those nice, young teens.
We raised you better than that!
Like, what are they saying?
I don't feel right spying on those nice people and their rude children.
Well, then get out of the way and let someone else listen.
Must have been the wind.

You can't tell us when to go to bed!
We're teenagers.

- And besides...

Honey, you still got it.
Come on, Rob.

It's kinda getting late.
We should probably turn in, too.
Does anybody remember which...
I think it was that one.
I don't think it was that one.
Like, it's been forever and there hasn't been one doorway.
Maybe we should turn back.
Or stop for a midnight snack.
Sorry, guys.

Wait, I see a light up ahead.
Is it the inn?
No, I think it's the police station.
Let's just get out of this tunnel.
Hold on, someone's coming.
Let me look.
It looks like they're making furniture.
Why would they be building furniture in the middle of the night?
Like man, who cares?
Let's just get in there and apologize for coming through their painting and get back to our rooms.
Like, I am bushed and way overdue for my midnight snack.
Shaggy, wait!
- What was that?

Let's check outside.
Help me push this against the wall.
Okay, they're gone now.

It's stuck.
Man, oh, man, who built a smuggling tunnel you can't smuggle things out of?
We'll just have to keep looking for another exit.
Come on.
That's it!

I can't go on!
Let's face it.
We're mole people now.
We'll just spend the rest of our lives underground.
Just the five of us, and that crab over there, building a new underground society.
Shaggy, snap out of it!
Sorry.

So, so very hungry.
You think any of these rocks are edible?
Hold on a second.

Yeah, that little guy over there.
Hey, we could eat that crab!
Yeah!
If there's a crab, then we must be close to the shore and an exit.
Come on, gang, follow that crab.
It's the Salty Brick.
Not that creepy old pirate ship again!
Jeepers.

They must have sailed it in during low tide, when the opening would be larger.
Pretty ingenious.
From the outside, you wouldn't even know there was a cave here most of the time.
Well, let's check it out.
- No way, no how.

I thought you said you wanted to investigate this case?
I'm tired, I'm hungry, my legs are sore, and I've already been chased off that boat once today.
There is nothing you can say or do to get me and Scooby to go back on that creepy old ship.
I can think of something.
You wouldn't dare!
- Would you do it...

- For a...

Scooby Snack?
Stand firm, old buddy.
We do not need it.

Two Scooby Snacks?
Nuh-uh.

Like, we are a united front, and you shall never break us.
Three Scooby Snacks?
Yes, absolutely.

We'll do anything!
We're weak.
So weak!
It's Brenda and Tommie!
Thank goodness you guys showed up.
Just in time, too.
What do you mean, "just in time"?
Those creepy pirate kooks said they'd be coming back at dawn.
Of course!
According to the poem, they're supposed to shake hands at dawn for the treasure.
That's not too long from now.
Hmm...

We'll have to work fast.
I think you mean, like, walk fast, as in, run, as in, let's get out of here before the pirates show up?
Sorry, Shaggy.

Tommie, Brenda, you guys get help.
We're gonna stay here and set up a trap.
- Right on.

Maybe Scoob and I should go with them.
Yeah, Fredman, with them.
Shaggy, Scooby, I need you to go gather some wood from those walkways down there and come back as fast as you can.
Like, dude, I'm starting to miss party animal Fred.
Come on, Scoob.
Daphne, Velma, you two help me gather up some nets and rope.
If this works, we'll be back on the beach having fun in no time.
That reminds me.
We really should try to come up with some new dance moves.
I wouldn't want people to think we're a couple of one-trick ponies.
Good thinking.
Maybe if we move our arms and legs kinda like...
Guys, seriously?

- Uh, right.

That wasn't bad.
It's no Jinky, but not bad.
Guys!
That ought to do.

Right.
- Uh-oh.

Look for yourself.
Hold on, I can't see.

Oh, excuse me, would you mind holding these for me just for a second?

Oh, I see.
Boy, do I feel silly.
Like, how oblivious can you get?
P-Pirates.
P-Pirates?
Pirates!
I'll take these back now.
New plan.

I think this might work.
Yeah, it seems like a pretty solid trap.
No.

I think with the right musical beat...
Fred!
Right...

- Fred!

- Daphne!

All right, you scurvy dogs.
Who are you calling "dogs"?
Hey!
No offense, Scoob.
It's time ye all be walking the plank.
Great.

That's what you're worried about?
It's a big deal.
I was almost officially and verifiably fun.
I'm sorry I teased you guys about being boring.
I'm sorry we got carried away.
And I'm sorry to interrupt, but I thought ye all were walking the plank.
Yeah.

Well, this is it.
I guess we better jump, guys.
What's the hurry?
I think it's time...
Pedal to the medal, Tommie.
Looks like those pirates are steering their ship around.
They'll never be able to make it through there.
They'll have to wait hours for the tide to get low enough to sail out.
Or they could do that.
Oh, this is fun!
Hey, everybody.

It looks like Brenda, Tommie and the new kids!
And the pirates.
Almost to shore, gang.
I just wanted to have a fun, relaxing weekend.
Next time, I'll just stay home and read a book.
Come on, everybody, let's give those pirates what for.
Yeah!
We made it.
Return fire!
Fire.

Gosh, I'm really sorry about your inn and the rest of the boardwalk, Mr. and Mrs. Holdout.
Do you think you'll rebuild?
Oh, heavens, no.
Most of those places were so old, we don't even have the instructions for them anymore.
No.

Mr. Monkfish our land and what's left of the boardwalk tomorrow morning.
Sorry, we've got no other choice.
That's right.
I'd like to say I'm sad to see you go, but point of fact,
I'm over the moon.
Mr. Monkfish, this is hardly the time or place.
Where's your sense of decency?
"Decency", he says!
Oh, that's rich.
- You believe that?

Oh, what do you know.
What does "SD" stand for, anyway, Strange Dog?
I'll tell you all who the decent ones around here are.
Those pirates, that's who.
I'd like to shake their hands.
Hands or hooks or whatever they've got, I'll shake it.
Not only have they put an end to all your cheap, low class,
Bingo Bash shenanigans, they've also paved the way for my ultra-modern high-end pier complex.
They even did the most of the demolition work for me, how about that?

Oh, can it, you loudmouth.
Mitzi!
Why I never...

Apologize this instant!
I apologize, all right.
I'm sorry I ever started working for you.
I'm sorry I actually defended you when people said you were rotten.
And I'm sorry I didn't see you for what you are a whole lot sooner.
This is my hometown.
It's where I grew up.
And now, it's nothing.
If you were any kind of human being, you would see how hurt I am, but you're not.
You're just a greedy troll that moved out from under his bridge and set up shop on a pier.
I'm hurt.

You have three daughters!
Three?

Well, you were like the fourth I never had.
But now you're nothing to me.
Just like the rest of these screwy misfits.
As for you two, this changes nothing.
We made a deal and I expect to see you at the pier tomorrow morning to finalize the paperwork.
We'll be there.
Unlike you, we handle ourselves with dignity.
That's right.

Now buzz off, you hopeless clod!
You don't have to ask me twice.
I'm giving you a second chance.
What for?

But if you come with me now, I'm willing to forgive everything.
I believe the lady said buzz off!
Et tu, Mitzi?
Sorry about that, everyone.
I tried to talk him out of coming down here, but when he gets an idea in his head, there's just no stopping him.
That's all right, dear.
It was nice to finally see you stand up to him.
Well, Laura, honey, we should probably get going.
No use sitting around, moping about what's already over.
Agreed.
Chad, Krissy, come on, we're leaving.
Bye, everyone.
Bye.
Bye.
Well, on the bright side, at least now we'll be Captains of the Bash for life.
Yeah.

Oh, get lost, creeps.
Sorry.

We're out.
Smell you later, beach bummers!
Well, I guess Mr. Holdout's right.

No more Bingo Bash.
- No more captains.

I can't believe the Holdouts are selling.
It's over.
Wait, it's not over.
There's still one more day.
Fredman, I admire your attitude.
But look around.

No.
We still need to crown the Captains of the Bash.
Oh, Fred, give it up.
This isn't about being fun or cool anymore.
It's not about all that.
It's about teamwork and not giving up.
Gather around, everyone.
I've got a plan.
Hey, Sheriff!

When you guys are done there, stop by!
Right next to the roller coaster.
I did not give you permission to use my pier.
Come down here right now!
Sorry, can't.
No dogs allowed.
We'll see about this!
All right, are we all clear on what to do?
- I think so.

Just lure them to that spot and then make sure you get out of the way.
- Daphne?

Be prepared to spring the net when they hit that spot.
And stand by on the secondary net, just in case.
We got it.
It's not rocket science, friend.
That's the go sign.

Hello, Bingo Bashers!
Now, as you all know, each year at the end of the Bash we crown the two people who really stood out as the lives of the party.
And this year...
Not so fast, boyo.
We're putting an end to this party once and for all.
There'll be no more captains.
It ends with us.
Oh, no.
Please, don't hurt us.
Yeah, please.
Don't come after us.
You?

Obviously it'd be them we're after.
Aye.

Us?

Jinkies!
Guys!
- Sorry.

You're the ones everyone follows.
And you're the ones we're gonna stop.
Oh, new plan.
- Everybody...

Scoob!
- Huh?

- Hmm?

Smile.
Hmm!
Hey, hey!
Hey, we were here first.
Huh?
Boy, how about those pirates thinking we deserve to be Bash Captains.
Maybe we could discuss this sometime when we're not running for our lives.
On the one hand, it's pretty flattering.
On the other hand, though, it really threw my plan for a loop.
Fred, that's it!

Hey, everyone, try to lure them over to the roller coaster.
Shaggy, Scooby, come with me.
- Where did they go?

- Now we've gotcha!

- Uh?

Bye-bye, we were just leaving.
Ha-ha, fooled you.
Not again.
Uh-oh!
- Help!

Whoo-hoo!
Huh?
Come on, we've got to help Shaggy and Scooby.
Velma, I need you at the stage.
Daphne, get up to the Ferris wheel.
Okay, everyone, teamwork!
Not again!
Scooby, old pal, this is it.
My one regret is that I didn't eat more Scooby Snacks.
- Yikes!

Now to see who these pirates really are.
Chad and Krissy!
Oh, kids, how could you?
Oh, I'm so ashamed.
That's right, they just couldn't let go of their titles.
Release us this instant.
We are your captains.
Ah, that's just sad.
I couldn't figure out the motivation behind the pirate's attacks.
At first I thought they wanted their hats back because the hats were mentioned in that poem about finding the missing treasure.
But if that were the case, why did they keep attacking once they had the hats?
Obviously they wanted to stop the Bash for some reason.
So I figured by announcing that we'd be crowning the new Bash Captains, that would be enough to lure the culprits into our trap.
Wait a second!

Like, how could they steal the hats off of their own heads?
Unless...
Like, they were really ghost pirates the whole time.
No, they're not.
Also, how could they have been at the Octo Rock Lounge being mean to you guys at the same time they were chasing Shaggy and Scooby
- around the Salty Brick?

- Easy, they didn't.

Well, you heard the girl, they're innocent.
Best untie them and we'll be on our way.
Not so fast.
They're didn't, their partners did.
You see, I first struck upon the idea that it wasn't just one set of pirates but two, when Mr. Holdout here told us the best way to solve this case would be to work as a team.
My suspicions were confirmed when I noticed that one set of pirates seemed to move slower than the others.
Not to mention Belle switched from being left-handed to right-handed and back again.
So I asked myself, who would know enough about this town and its past to pull of these crimes?
Who would benefit from the destruction of the boardwalk both monetarily, and by destroying any evidence of their crimes?
And who would know enough about the Salty Brick to expertly sail it into a secret harbor in an attempt to try to find the treasure?
I know!

I never trusted him.
I'm innocent, I tell you.

No.

It was none other than Mr. and Mrs. Holdout.
- What?

- That is just plain absurd.

Mrs. Holdout, I noticed when you checked us in, that you were left-handed.
Mr. Holdout, you could remember the ridiculously long name of a long-dead parrot and every other detail about the pirates.
But when it came to reciting a poem that might lead us to suspect you, you had conveniently forgotten it.
You also were surprised to hear Brenda and Tommie had gone missing, but not that the Salty Brick had been stolen.
And when we made a noise in the secret passageway you all looked towards the painting, whereas the police assumed, when we made a noise in their wall, that it must have come from outside.
Wait, you were where now?
You even said to Mr. Monkfish when he was accusing you that you would see the boardwalk destroyed before you sold it to him.
Oh, Rob, I've always said you talk too much.
All right, fine, it's all true.
And we would've gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for our meddling kids.
- Hey!

I had the whole thing worked out...
Been planning it for years.
I even let all the insufferable teens of this town play our boardwalk games and ride the attractions for free so they'd vote our rotten kids captains.
I had to get those hats.
It's in the poem...

"great treasure," yada, yada, yada.
Only we had those hats for a year.
Tipped them all over town, shook hands every dawn,
- and no treasure.

I thought if I could just have a little more time with them, I could find the treasure.
So we stole the hats.
Then things got out of hand with Chad and Krissy kidnapping those teens.
Sorry, Brenda.

And then we blew up the boardwalk.
Sorry about that, everyone.

That way we could destroy those incriminating tunnels and then sell the whole thing off to Monkfish.
So at least we could make some money from this whole fiasco.
And that explains why they sabotaged my roller coaster.
Wait, no it doesn't.

- We didn't.

You see, I first realized that...
Ugh, look, sweetheart, I've already sat through two of these reveals.
You think you could just cut to the chase?
Ooh, but I never get to do these.
Ah, fine.

We saw them building office furniture out of pieces of your roller coaster in order to hide the evidence.
They wanted to destroy tourism so they wouldn't have to work so hard.
Huh, so you're saying I didn't do any of the crimes this weekend?

I would have put my money on me.
I mean, I'm such a greedy businessman.
That's right, we did it.

How are you going to arrest us?
We're the only law in this town.
- Check and mate.

Dr. Najib!
Hey, guys.
What, you all know this guy?
I couldn't help it.
He made it sound like so much fun and he promised to go to jail right after the Bash.
I believe my friend here could help in arresting these gentlemen.
Oof, I don't know.

Okay, I could never say no to you.
Come on, everybody.
You'll all have to scooch into the back of my car.

If it helps I could drive separately.
That'd be great.

Oh, no you don't.

What am I gonna do with you?
Take you to jail, that's what.
Well, bye again, everybody.
Bye.
Well, I guess that's everything.
Not totally.
Don't you wanna know where the hidden treasure is?
You mean you know?
Pretty easy when you've been cracking poem-based clues as long as I have.
Brenda, Tommie, will you take these hats over to the front of the ship?
So the poem says, "Go on bow."
The bow is what you call the front of a ship.
Now, if you guys will tip the hats.
So the next part says,
"At the dawn, shake hands for good measure."
Young lady, dawn isn't for another 10 hours.
I'd like to wrap this up and get dinner sometime soon.
If that's okay with you.
See, that's the mistake Mr. Holdout made.
"Dawn" isn't referring to the time of day.
The figurehead on the Salty Brick is of Aurora, the Roman goddess of the dawn.
Brenda, Tommie, shake her hands.
- Holy moly!

Wow!
By my estimation there should be enough there to rebuild the boardwalk.
But the Holdouts already sold the boardwalk to Mr. Monkfish.
Ah, go ahead and take it back.
We've already had too many bad guys today as is.
Yay!
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.
Ah, who could blame you, I'm very unlikable.
Fred, Velma, I think I speak for everybody here when I say, we want to name the two of you this year's Captains of the Bash.
Yeah, you guys might not be the loosest cats around, but you never gave up on the party and that's the true spirit of the Bash.
Thanks, but no thanks.
We're retiring from the party animal life.
Fun was fun, but deep down our hearts are as square as they get.
But I can think of three worthy replacements who never gave up on this case.
Daphne, Shaggy and Scooby.
What are your orders, my captains?
Let's party!
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
