Inspired by actual events
My name is Thorkild Bonnesen.

And I just emptied a bottle of whisky.
I'm not dancing because I'm celebrating anything.

I've lost everything.

To fall so low you've got to start at the top.

I had it all.

Do you hear me?

... a big mansion and a lovely lady.

Grace.

We met in Ghana.

I was on top of the world.
But the '80s had only just begun.
1983 is going to be a good year.
I was making a bundle as head of a large Danish electronics company.
But a new market is emerging.
But the owners were clueless.

Had I proposed the microwave, Rubic's cube, video games, the Walkman or...
- Voilà.

A computing solution for private use.

Ordinary people will never use computers.
- Trust me.

Focus on the company, okay?

- I quit.

No!

- I never let adversity crush me.

I came from nothing and grew up in an orphanage.
They belted you if you had any good ideas.
The better the idea, the harder the beating.
I won't let anybody boss me around anymore.
There's always a new adventure if you just look for it.
You charge an arm and a leg.

- Are you okay?

- What on earth is that?

- Powered by a battery.

I invented the battery myself.

- But it can't power this guy, can it?

But it's an amusing thought.
We'll come back to this original.

I want to make the world's first electric car.
No, it's not for the disabled.
This could turn out to be the biggest car venture in Scandinavia.
Great ideas are those others reject.

Yes, I have heard of Volvo.

Imagine a car that doesn't run on gas.

- It would be damn cheap.

If you insist on making a car, make one that runs on fucking cocaine.
- Then I'm game!

The voice of reason is Per Lawman.
He handles my finances and he's a bona fide yuppie.
Nose candy?
Holy moly.
- Got any more ice?

Søs, Thorkild wants ice.

He holds the record for attorneys who've busted out of jail.
Sayonara, motherfuckers!
Anyway, I needed to assemble a crack team.
I'll drive.
No, not these guys.

These guys.

Those intent on breaking the mold.
Welcome.
Henrik wasn't hard to convince.
- Good to see you.

My go-to guy.

It's Tuesday, and you're tuned into your fave channel.
Wham bang thank you ma'am, have a grrrreat day.
Is that your lower lip or are you wearing a turtleneck?
He oughta be on the radio!
The next guy was Vonsil.
- I'm Vonsil.

I've only got one arm.

Right, almost anything by mouth.
Welcome to the South Harbor.
Vonsil didn't look successful.
I'm staying at the garage at the moment, or rather illegally going on five years.
Brewski?
Cheers.
But I needed his skills.
- About that fiberglass...

How's about that?
First you mold the shape.
Then I coat it with fiberglass, liquid epoxy, for a smooth surface.
- Smooth surface?

It withstands almost anything.

- But this is an ass, right?

It's Samantha Fox's ass.

- I've never tried that before.

- That sure is a light ass.

"You're a lightweight".

Vonsil's okay.

It sure takes balls to go for black upholstery with a pink lining.
- Who's the guy with the battery?

- Is he coming?

And finally Jens Knastrup, Knas.

Mr. Battery.
Hello.
- Kirsten?

He was hardest to convince.

- We haven't got a sun lounge.

I've got great news.
I'm meeting a man today who wants to use my battery for an electric car.
- That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.

- We're meeting...

Jens, get real.
Just build that sun lounge you promised me over a year ago!
Nice day in school?
You'll be going to high school soon.

Not that Daddy liked high school much, but after that comes the university.
That'll be better.

I'm a very persuasive guy.

- This is my wife, Kirsten.

- Fanny, our daughter.

That's what you get for stuffing yourself with candy and soda, Fanny.
- Right...

- Having you on?

Kirsten, isn't there something you really want?
- You want a sun lounge.

I'll get you a sun lounge if you'll let me borrow your genius, Mr. Battery.
Kirsten, you made the right decision.

- Nice to meet you, Kirsten.

Let's go.
When you set out to revolutionize the auto industry, you have to go all in.
The big money is found out of town.
A BUFFET OF OPTIONS VOTE FOR KAI OVE
Nothing spells big money like a small-town mayor.
RESTAURANT PEDER OXE
I gather Bjerringsund is interested in new business ventures.
Yes, Bjerringsund Municipality holds great potential.
I always compare it to a buffet.

Three kinds of herring, battered plaice with tartare sauce   egg and shrimps, chicken-and- asparagus tartlets, warm liver pa...
Don't interrupt when we're discussing local politics!

We need room.
We have plenty of room.

A small-town mayor is easily impressed.

Reedtz-Thott!
Ladies and gentlemen, the first Danish strawberries.
Fantastic!

- 800 kroner?

- There you go, sir.

- May I document the occasion?

Well, Kai Ove?

Now we just needed to break the story.
The world's first electric car.
Any questions?
Yes.
Say you're plastered and ram into a pensioner at a bus stop   won't you get an electric shock?
- That's one for you, Knas.

You may get acid all over.

Let me stop you right there.

I bet.

- In less than a year.

You're a dreamer, Thorkild.

Wanna bet?


Our production will take place in Bjerringsund.
- If there are no more questions...

Great to see so many photographers.

- Put on a happy face, will you?

- Kirsten won't be pleased.

When I say we're going to Bjerringsund, we are.
Just one more, with all of you jumping for joy.
Ready?

New venture comes to Bjerringsund
Well?

Yeah...

They're just dazzled.

What do you call the critter that's been warming your ballsack all the way?
- Freddie.

Nej, Freddie Mercury.
Jens, what am I supposed to do here?
Stop kicking me all the time, Fanny.

Wow, Thorkild.
- I like the premises.

We'll do fine here.
Welcome to Bjerringsund and to the future.

- Cheers, cheers.

- Henrik, show us what we're making.

- This is how I envision our car.

It looks like a bumper car for idiots.

It's not a car for the disabled.

- What color did you have in mind?

Yeah.
I was thinking mouse grey like a mouse's fur.
I was thinking black.
Sure, with Blackie running about at home bare-assed and in a banana skirt.
I was thinking a nice and friendly pastel shade.
- Banana.

I'm not riding around in a pastel-colored car.

- What are we talking about?

Kai Ove.

This is the team.
On behalf of the town -

I've taken the liberty of bringing you a small welcome present.
A calendar adorned with pictures of the city council.
I'm November.
Funny you should say that.

- Indeed.

An electric car?

I thought you were making an electric kettle.

No, an electric car.

I'd go with the electric kettle.
People can better relate to that.
Well, I've got to run.
I'll just leave the same way I came in.
What the hell?
It's time to find an international name for the car.

A brainstorm is where you say all the ideas that come to mind.
- Boy, oh boy.

I'm scared I'll say the wrong thing and you'll use it.
- But it's a brainstorm.

Ratata?
- Ratata?

- Are we gonna go with Ratata now?

Dream because it goes like a dream, and Dan because we're from...
Denmark.

Dan Dream has a nice ring to it.

- Dan Dream.

- What's with the Lucky Luke references?

We're calling it Dan Dream!
Bye.
- Hi.

- What?

What?
Four croissants, please.
- Nobody eats that around here.

When car buyers from all over the world come, they'll want croissants, too.
So, four croissants.
No, I'll try something new.

Right.
Good morning.

I've opened the electric car factory.
We're from Copenhagen.

But you'll find that we're just like you.
- Hi, Henrik.

Henrik, I'm having a pool party tonight.
Henrik.

- Why don't we have a pool like them?

You're such a drag, Jens.
Let's get this pool party started.

Rule no. 1:

Rule no. 2:

Henrik!

- I am!

And we're off!

Well, Kirsten.

Sure, but I'd rather have a job.

- Oh, I see.

- I'm not a librarian.

We'll have to look into that.
So, spending some dough out of town, are you?
Manufacturing a car costs.

- Sure, I've got a handle on it.

- For fuck's sake, Knas!

Jesus, you've got a dead one there.

- Yeah.

Grace, it's all in good fun.
City fuckers!
Hey!

Why did you kill the music?
- What's going on?

- What about it?

- I can't see anyone.

- What's up?

You're such a drag!
Oh my God, Jens.

- No.

Dunno.
You're alright, man.

- You big idiot.

Cheers.

- On the count of three, get dressed!

- One, two, three.

- You're welcome to jump in.

I'm a Bjerringsund boy.

- So go jump in the bay, Kai Ove.

- But the bay's far away.

It's only 400 yards, so I'll be back in 10 minutes.
- I'll just grab a towel.

- Ole Abildgaard, Mads Ulrik, me and...

Yeah, we all hit Submarina.
Well, well...
That stays between us, okay?

- Who kisses who is nobody's business.

- Who's kissing who?

Henrik, shut the fuck up.
- I'm pissed.

Thanks.

- Bye for now, Vonsil.

I'm borrowing your slippers.

- Why don't you sleep over?

- A major contractor's up the creek.

Sure, I'll be in Copenhagen in 40 minutes.
40 minutes?

Per?

Sure, what's the big deal?

See you!
Here you go, honey.
Man!

Anything wrong?
Vonsil grabbed my butt.
- He doesn't respect me.

- It's because I'm African.

That he doesn't respect me.
- Kai Ove?

I just went out for a swim, but then I changed my mind.
- Well, it's quite far away.

- Is Kit still here?

Sure.

- She left at three.

Thank you for a lovely evening.
You're welcome.
FUCKER
Man, I'd love to hump September!
- Vonsil?

Got a minute?

Vonsil, Grace is a bit pissed off because you grabbed her ass.
Oh that.

She's a Negro.

Sure they do, but lay off anyway, okay?
- Sure.

But Grace is afraid we don't respect her.
- Didn't she used to be a prostitute?

- As a hooker.

- As a stripper?

- For real?

Goddamn!

- "Got a job for me?"

- Freddie's been kidnapped!

Freddie!
Calm down, Henrik.

Freddie!

Well, well, well.

Hand over the rabbit, and we're out of here.
Too posh to eat a sloppy joe?
Just hand over Henrik's rabbit, and we're out of here.
- Who says this is the faggot's rabbit?

The rabbit is his.

- Put the rabbit down.

- Call him over.

Come on, Freddie.
That's it, come on, Freddie.

Good boy, Freddie!

Damn!
- Did you fire that?

Are you the guy from Copenhagen?

- Nonsense.

- And they say you're screwing a rabbit.

City fucker!
- Hello, Kai Ove.

I'm just changing the water in the fish tank.
I want to do an open house at the factory.
- Okay?

- I'll serve oysters and champagne.

Free beer, hot dogs and happy jazz will have them crawling out of the woodwork.
Kai Ove?

- Hi, Kit.

- What happened to your eye?

Well, that's little Kit for you.
She's such a klutz.
She bumped into a knee.

We've got to get going.

- I'm ready.

Get in here.

Welcome.

Hi there, Fanny.
Vonsil, put the calendar away.

- They can't see what month it is?

Great do, Thorkild.
Now you see where beer, happy jazz and hot dogs will get you in this town.
You just met Brownie.

- Her nipples are huge and brown.

She's cheap.

Now, these are the galvanized screws.
But these are the non-galvanized screws.
You reek of sweat.

- Don't you shower anymore?

I showered...
Where's the calendar?

Good grief!
She's bored.

So I'm really glad you promised her that librarian job.
- We just talked about it.

- It'll make Kirsten happy again.

- In what way?

I do it all the time with Grace.

- If you know what I mean...!

Let's take one of me inside the car.
- We don't need to.

Welcome to open house at Dan Dream   the world's first electric car.
I have a dream.

I want to make a good electric car, but safety is a top priority as well   which our technical supervisor will tell you more about:

We're going to perform a crash test   by ramming the car into a concrete wall at 30 mph.
- Help!

How damaged is it?

Vonsil, go over and check the damage.
Shit.
Don't worry.

Electric car and heaps of free hot dogs
- What a success!

People loved it.
I saw a woman drinking a Coke with two straws.

- This calls for champagne, doesn't it?

That's my stump.

Hi, Kirsten.
- What are you doing home?

Oh.
- Who are you?

He's... teaching me how to play the trumpet.
- The trumpet?

I take trumpet lessons twice a week with Bjørn.
- Oh?

Trumpet Bjørn.
Where's the trumpet?
You've got a nerve!

Spare me your pathetic questions!
- Is your daughter's name really Fanny?

You do know it means vagina, right?

It was Kirsten's idea.

- You can't make fun of that.

Good morning.

- A library job for Kirsten?

Look.
- Well?

- Look, Freddie!

We've been cooped up here long enough.

Is it true that Prime Minister Schlüter is coming to Forum?
The PM himself will present the electric car from Bjerringsund   the home town of Kai Ove.

- We're presenting it in 14 days?

We aren't ready.

The world press is coming.

But I've got problems at home.

Keep your eye on the ball here.

Let's take it.

Am I right?

- 14 days, Thorkild.

Give me five!

I think it's chic.

Hell yeah.

The brakes don't work.

- Hit the brakes!

- Use the handbrake.

- Why don't they work?

Oh shit!
Goddammit!
- Sit still.

Why aren't you working?

- Well, you can thank Knas.

Kirsten called to say he wasn't coming.
Do I have to go pick him up myself?
Thanks a lot!
Hi, Fanny.
- Knas, why aren't you at work?

We're moving back to Copenhagen so I can get my library job back.
- But I need Knas.

- I promise I'll get you that job.

- Right now?

- Get me that job!

Alright, let's do it.
- Can I go to work then?

I'm driving.
Fanny, let's go.
- Thanks.

- The Brownie?

Hello.
- We're closed.

I scratch your back...
Okay, then.

- Didn't we have some mints?

- This is taking ages.

- You start tomorrow at 10.

Happy now, Kirsten?
- I can't believe we made it.

- With a party bus.

Just wait until we return from Forum.

- Congratulations, Thorkild.

We've got a driver, a driver, as crazy as MacGyver in the bus, yeah in the bus, yeah.
We've got a driver, a driver, as crazy as MacGyver in the bus where we hang out.
- Cheers!

I've booked a table for us at Baron Von Dy.
No way am I gonna dip my skewer where you dip yours, if you get my drift!
I don't.

Vonsil, please double-check tomorrow   that there are two wedges under the front wheels, so it won't roll.
- Aye-aye, captain.

Grace, when you've driven five laps...

When Grace has driven five laps tomorrow, she'll go to pit   and then I want people to ask you questions, okay?
- Yes.

- Can Freddie come?

As long as he doesn't poop on the PM.
Poop or no poop, I can't wait to meet Prime Minister Schlüter.
- You have to cook it first.

- You have to cook it in the pot first.

- You can't eat raw chicken.

Oh shit.
I'd like to thank my wife   for being a real trooper about all this.

You've settled in in Bjerringsund.

- So I got you a present.

- Wow.

- Well, well.

- Sure you do.

- Grace wants a fanfare.

- You can do it.

Play the one, you know...
Come on now, Kirsten, Kirsten, Kirsten   and Kirsten, Kirsten, Kirsten, Kirsten.

- We promise to sing along, Kirsten.

Kirsten, who the fuck's giving you trumpet lessons?
Trumpet Bjørn.

- Trumpet Bjørn, you know...

- We'll get much joy out of that.

Here's to a fantastic international presentation tomorrow.

I've got a big day tomorrow.

It's gonna make a splash.

We're a good team.

- I don't play the trumpet.

- It's a difficult instrument.

I had an affair with Bjørn.
You're never here.

- So you haven't tooted the trumpet?

I tooted Bjørn's horn, for God's sake.
- Twice a week for four hours?

- Thorkild, got a moment?

Look, I didn't get to look at your accounts until this morning.
- You've spent all your money.

Renting Forum, checking buyers into the D'Angleterre   sun hats, happy jazz.

Sure, but once the buyers see the car, we're gonna be rolling in money.
- I'm glad to her that.

- Sure all that coke isn't dangerous?

Hey there!

Your first?
Thorkild, something just crossed my mind while I was in the can.
Did you say Grace was driving the car?
Yes.

No, but there's no getting around she's a Negro.

Can't you hear how crazy that sounds?

It's like a hat wearing a hat or cheese with cheese.
- It's 1983.

Beer and hot dogs work.

- Are you okay?

I think I'm allergic to this fondue.

I think I'm gonna need a towel.
- Thorkild, aren't you coming to bed?

If this fails...
What?
Everything is impossible until it's been done.
- Nelson Mandela says so.

Papa T. Come to bed.
- Come on.

Thanks, Grace.
- I love you.

- What's that?

Or maybe Kirsten's practicing the trumpet.

No.

Who'd have thought little Denmark would build its own car?

People are coming from near and far   including journalists from 41 countries.
Dan Dream will be doing the rounds here at Forum   all thanks to entrepreneur Thorkild Bonnesen and his dream team.
Hi, Thorkild.

I ordered 30 of your new car.
So we're pretty excited to see what we ordered.
- Yeah.

Pitch-black.

Well, so long.
Hi, Papa T. Everything looks great!
Look, I've been thinking.

- Why not?

- I'm an experienced driver.

I've been talking to people, and we have to remember what people want.
- They don't want anything strange.

- What matters is what they want.

Buyers have come from West Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium but not Uganda.
And so what?

It's going to be too weird, period.

- A hat wearing a hat?

It's weird.

- Are you sick?

- Put that hand away.

Grace, try to see it my way.
Boys, Grace isn't driving the car.
- Okay.

No, think of the stakes.

You're too conspicuous.

I'll do it.

Per Lawman, no thanks.

- Where is Knas?

Goddammit!
He's right.

- Look who's talking.

Knas!

Knas, dammit!

- You're driving the car.

Yes.

Kirsten's had an affair with Trumpet Bjørn.
That'll have to wait.

- Hurry!

Shut the door.
- It's hot in here.

And we'll be a world sensation, okay?

Sure, let's stick to that.
Thorkild.
Shut the door.

Maybe Kirsten tooted or smooched Trumpet Bjørn's horn...
- Or his wiener.

Should I get a divorce?

Stop!

It's probably something Kirsten made up.

- Okay, now focus.

- She made it up.

- Yes.

- Thorkild, the PM's here.

How much we've seen in the world   and in Denmark since World War 2.
Sheltered by peacetime, we built up a new, modern Denmark.
Together, we can strengthen Danish research   and the development of products for the future.
Denmark's first electric car is about to drive its first lap.

There it is.
Wait until you hear how silent it is.
Don't worry.

The PM sure has a full head of hair.

But I never got to meet him.

Then the worst-case scenario would have been accidentally scalding the PM!
- Did you fall asleep, Knas?

- You must have dozed off.

Knas, you were fast asleep.
I was blinded by the photographers' flashes.
I don't notice the car rolling.

Oh, that bloody fondue stomach!
I crapped my pants.

- The press is waiting.

- We're not going to Kværndrup.

I'll wait in the bathroom.
I'm a size 46.

- Grace, get him some pants.

Like a hat wearing cheese or a cheese that's a hat or whatever.
Do I have do everything myself?

Hello there.
I need a size 46 of something like that.
Very well.
- That'll be 140 kroner.

Driver!

But, Thorkild, it's a denim jacket!
- Kai Ove, got time for a few questions?

- You must have some comments.

Sure, but give us a break.
Of course I understand, but...
You can't be serious, Claus.

I didn't wreck the car.

You're asking me how to spell Knas?

Very impressive.
The tabloids keep calling.
And the idiot from Silkeborg canceled the deal, too.

What the hell's happening?
How about the buyers from Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands?
No foreigners are gonna buy a Danish car that the Danes don't even believe in.
Surely you can see that.

The money's gone, Grace.

You're singing?

You like the pool, too.

Thorkild, it's your own fault.

You were afraid to let an African drive.
You didn't walk the line.

I sold my house, okay?

I've spent 60 million kroner.

I even had to screw the Brownie librarian   to get Kirsten a job, so Knas would go to work to get the car ready.
That sure as hell is going all in!
Grace, don't do that.

Grace!

Okay?

Grace.
Damn, it's sweet!
Grace!
Grace, I broke a bottle in the pool.

There's broken glass everywhere.

Grace!

I went to the garage and fixed the bumper and put in a new windshield   that'll deflect flash.
Anti-flash.

Flash?

- Thorkild, what now?

We're gonna go on as planned.

Tommy, another round of beers.

That's so Grace.

Always taking the easy way out.

I'm gonna call her.

Quiet, please.

Thanks.
What the fuck does it say?

- What does that say?

Not that!

- What does it say?

I can read the numbers 1-10.
Stop huffing, for fuck's sake.

I'm not trying to light a fire.

Give me a break!
4...

I hate to interfere, but the word is she's at the women's shelter in Gørlund.
- Where?

Let's go, guys.

I bet there are a lot of neglected, hence horny, women at that shelter.
What a mean thing to say.

My point exactly.
- Look, I'm here to get my girlfriend.

- Men are not allowed here.

Hey!
Let's go, guys!
- There she is!

- Hell, that's not Grace.

- Yes.

- Oh come on.

Kit?
Let's go to the pub.
No, I want to go home.

Oh, shut up.

If only you'd got her that job, it wouldn't have happened.
So now it's my fault?

Thorkild.

Good jobs?

Vonsil's right.

I've fucking had it!
Get out of the car!

I'm calling the whole thing off.

- It's my car.

And so we're back where we started.

Thorkild Bonnesen?

You're coming with me to the police station.
- Listen to the music.

- You have to come with me.

- Come here.

Bonnesen?
And so I hit rock bottom.
- Good morning, Thorkild.

He made the front page.

- The man just fell asleep.

An enginear-death experience, get it?

What a fucking idiot.
Well...
- Isn't it early for strawberries?

Hey!

Hey, come back.
Hey!

- Thanks for letting me borrow them.

I quit cocaine.

- I'm bored as hell.

You have to get me out of here.

Help me.

Maybe I can help the both of us.

I'll do a double line.
- Welcome back, buddy.

- This is it, Papa T.

- Let go of me!

Run!
You may ask   what a lawnmower like this has to do with modern transport.
Well, this is no ordinary lawnmower.
It moves on the grass with the help of an air cushion.
Hello, Kirsten.

- What do you want?

I forgive you for Forum.

You were in the dark in the car, and the PM's speech was long and boring.
I forgive you, and I'm sorry you were the laughing stock of Denmark.
- "An enginear-death experience."

But, Knas?
You and I are going for an important ride in our Dan Dream car.

- Now?

No, Jens.

And I'm reduced to being the woman married to the Forum idiot.
I'm not making any more sacrifices.
Sacrifices?

You only got the job because Thorkild fucked the chief librarian.
For 20 stiff minutes, Thorkild had to ram his penis   in the librarian's red, hairy vagina!

- To get you a job!

Not now!

He didn't enjoy it anyway.

And get off Fanny's back.

She's not unhappy because she's fat, She's fat because she's unhappy!
And you're not really fat, Fanny.

You're the most beautiful girl in Bjerringsund.
Thanks, Dad.
This almond tart is for you.
- I'll drive.

These are the first Danish strawberries, We're gonna deliver them to Peder Oxe.
- Why deliver them to a restaurant?

To prove the car's alright.

- Knas fell asleep.

Relax, it was my fault.

Knas.

- We love you, Thorkild.

Okay, but what about the car?

- We need 30-40 batteries.

Your little shit box ruined the good reputation of Bjerringsund!
I guarantee you that no one's gonna help you.
Oh yes.

Before Thorkild came to town, this town was a lifeless hole.
- He gave us all faith in...

No, Kai Ove.

That's a downright lie!

Hey, hey, hey!

Sit down!
You're the dumbest idiots I ever saw, but you sure have given us a laugh.
- Hell, I'll give you a battery.

- Me too.

- Thanks, Trumpet Bjørn.

- And me.

Thanks a lot.

- Where are the strawberries?

- This is a genuine adventure.

- But there's only four of us.

'Five and the Spazz Jeep'.
- Did you talk to Grace?

- I treated her badly.

No, she's just somewhere else.

Africa?

Ever heard the one about the two Negroes at the steak joint?
"Two well-done, thanks." "I can see that, but what'll it be?"
You gotta drop the Negro jokes.
It's all in good fun.
- I'm sick of them.

No!

- Oh come on.

Keep telling Negro jokes until you stop laughing and get it out of your system.
- And then we'll continue, okay?

Okay, here goes.
What do you call a Negro with a wooden leg?
A stick in a turd.
What does a Negro who's got the shits say? "Help, I'm melting!"
What do you say to a Negro in a uniform?

What does a Negro with 12 warning triangles up his ass look like?
A Toblerone.
I'm done.

- Then let's go.

Ever heard the one about the two Eskimos who pass by a bar?
And the last battery, Henrik.

I think so.
What's happening?
- The battery's dead.

Okay.

Then we stop it, grab their battery and go on.

No fucking way!

I think I'm ready to settle down.
I'm tired of messing around with a new chick every night.
Every night?

You haven't been with a chick either.
No.

- It's not exactly a secret anymore.

- No.

Yes.

- That's your secret, Knas?

But not cutlets.

What the hell?
Is that Thorkild?
We'll take this battery!
- It's a live one.

It's 25 times as powerful as a car battery.

- But that's great.

- We'll pull the handbrake as we go.

- Well, we're gonna.

Henrik?
I had a bad experience with a harvester.

- How awful.

You're gay?

Know what happens if a gay guy mistakes wallpaper paste for vaseline?
His wallpaper falls off.
Wallpaper!
Let's go!
Let's stick together.
Oh let's stick together.
Oh let's stick together
You know it's summer when Nanna sings 'Let's Stick Together'.
Baron Reedtz-Thott just picked up the first box of Danish strawberries   and is on his way in his Ferrari to Restaurant Peder Oxe.
Damn!
- Let's drop the handbrake.

- But we have to.

- We have to!

- Shut up, Knas.

It went like a dream, Knas.

Shit, man.

- I don't believe it.

I can see the restaurant from here.
- Grace.

- It's Grace!

- How did you know I was here?

They're calling you a hero.
And they said you were looking for me.
Everything is impossible until it's been done.
Grace, I want you to drive the car.

- We'll push.

- Okay.

- And push!

Yes, onwards.

- Here comes trouble.

- Did Reedtz-Thott bring strawberries?

- Yes!

Well done.

Thanks, but don't praise me.

- Talk to them.

- Congratulations, honey.

I need to do something.

Can I have your attention?

We succeeded.
Some people say:

Tell them:

Ladies and gentlemen:
I give you the first Danish strawberries.
They made it!
What the hell?
- Fucking rabbit!

The electric car Hope Whisper crashed at Forum on October 14th, 1983.
The cause of the crash is still uncertain.
After the crash, buyers and investors lost faith in the project.
Pre-orders worth millions were canceled and the people behind lost everything.
Later, electric cars turned out to be a pretty good idea.
Dedicated to the real Thorkild, Thure Barsøe-Carnfeldt   and the rest of the Hope Whisper Pioneers.
