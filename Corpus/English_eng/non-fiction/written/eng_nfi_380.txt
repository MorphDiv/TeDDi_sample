Good.
Then we can begin.
Anderson/Vaughan Investigations is back and better positioned to give you everything you need in a private investigation and security firm.

100%.

As soon as the FBI gives us back our files and our computers and our server.
Which they said they will do.
you're not under investigation?
we are not.

Alice.

Why?

We need our clients to trust us again.
I'm not trusting my zillion-dollar tech firm to a company who's under FBI investigation.
Seth's not like that.

I'll bet you he's exactly like that.
Look at him leaning back in his chair.
He can't get far enough away from us.
That's how fired we are.
he's just that comfortable here.
Except now he's out of the chair.

He's overcompensating.

And for understanding.
Of course.

There is no next one.

So we'll go out and find new ones.

You look good.

Actually...

Of course.

no.

I swear.

That's the problem.
Valerie: $3 million? but I don't have that kind of money. and that's my Social Security number.
It could be an accounting error.
although they usually take money.
They don't give it.
Whoever parked this money in your name knew you well enough to think you'd never find it.
is there a roommate or a girlfriend?
sadly.
Someone you work with?

Could you guys maybe help me find out?
We could if we had our computers.
You don't have any computers?
Sophie has her hacktop. we can at least let the IRS know.
we could keep the money.
It's not yours to keep. and I could pay you back for all the money that you've loaned me over the last few decades.
We could use the money.
Not if it belongs to someone else.
So...

I have a problem with you being out on the street in three to five years.
What would you say if I told you

I'd say... what's the catch?
The answer is no.

You're giving me a death sentence.
We're giving you the opportunity to live exactly as you did before.
but looping me in make arrests.
Once word spreads that I'm setting people up for the feds...

You're too good.

Fact.

We can.
How long would this deal be?

And exactly what kind of jobs are we talking about?
hand model.
but that got weird.
16 jobs in the last 3 months.
Did you give any of your employers your Social Security number?
You think one of them put the money in my name?
Could be.

Maybe that ferret guy in Studio City.
Ferret guy?
sorry.

Studio City?

Not long.

You didn't call me?
No.

But there are no jobs for millennials.

Why don't you know?
Because he's missing.
His ambulance never arrived at the hospital.

Because it appears to be a carefully orchestrated jailbreak.
Excuse me?
he wouldn't have done that.
You guys just made that ridiculous deal. so maybe he called you.

I want him to stay in jail.
You're the ones that got him out.
