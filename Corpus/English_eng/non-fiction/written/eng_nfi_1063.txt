Previously on "Rosewood"...
I ran the additional tests you asked for.
- Do you have family?

You're gonna need them.
The next battle you fight will not be one that you can handle alone.
You know about my dialysis.
I'm not gonna risk your life to save my own.
You need a kidney, or you're not gonna make it.
Slade told me you turned down his kidney.
Why do I get the feeling that I'm not the only guy you're worried about tonight?
When exactly did your last tour end?
I told you.

Your luggage didn't have any tags.
Is this an interrogation, Sis?
Only if you're hiding something.
Hello?
Yes, I promise I'm almost there.
Don't worry.

What are you doing?
911.

_
It's open!
- Okay.

- A woman comes home from vacation...

...finds a body in her mansion.
Well, good morning to you, Villa.
I'm six minutes early, which means I finally get a chance to meet your brother Marcos.
Oh, he's not here.
He, uh... he went for a run.
Oh, okay, so you want to clear me out before he gets back, huh?
Look, he still needs time to adjust.
And even if he were ready to socialize, you're too... perky.
Oh, well, I think the word you're looking for is "dynamic."
- Ah.

- "Vigorous." Maybe vigorous is...

Marcos, we were just leaving.
Ah, that's okay, Leese.
I knew you had company 'cause of that magnificent piece of machinery in the driveway.
See, that's a man with some excellent taste.
I'm Rosie.
I'm the owner of that magnificent car.
- I work with your sister.

That's the second time
- I'm seeing your face today, man.

- Ran by your billboard this morning.

Well, you know, the closest one to here is the one off the Venetian Causeway.
Yeah, I love that place.
There's, like, 360-degree views from the bridges.
- So you like to run.

Oh, see, I run four.

Well, you got to build up to it, you know.
- Right, right.

- then fives miles then six miles...

- ...but, um, we have to go.

Oh, by the way, Mom called me.
She's on her way from the airport.
She cut her trip short the minute she found out you were back.
She can't wait to see you.
Yeah, I can't wait to see her either.
But I...

- Oh, you do?

I got to be there in an hour, so I'll catch Ma this afternoon.
- Nice to meet you, man.

Marcos... finally met him.
You know, Marcos was great with you.
You mean I was great with him.
I have a way with the Villas.
He was friendly.

He's really making an effort.
Except for the part where he's avoiding your mother.
Right there.
- You picked up on that too?

Did you just say "a hummingbird's wings"?
Let it come over you.
My kidneys may be failing me, but my eyesight, and my similes, 20/20.
It's just, you know, we had a conversation about being a family again,
- and he seemed to be on board.

- Can I hear it?

All right, excuse me.
- She looks like she's sleeping.

Let's see... at negative 10 degrees, it'd take about 24 hours for a body to freeze solid.
The safety button malfunctioned.
We found ice in the mechanism.
It's not common, but it can happen.
Say this is an accident,
The victim comes inside the freezer, but the button jams, and she can't get out.
She dies of hypothermia?
I'm not so sure.
Look at her hands and her fingers.
No broken nails.

If she had been conscious, she would've made a violent attempt to get out this door.
So she was either dead or incapacitated and moved in here.
Hey, Rose-man.
Sorry it took me so long to get here.
Blue Thunder is a thing of beauty, but it's getting harder and harder to park that big girl.
She hates it when I call her that.
What do we got?
Okay, well, don't get too comfortable.
I need you to transport this body back to Magic City.
Why can't the coroner do it?
Because once it's thawed, the body will decompose quickly, taking any potential evidence with it.
That's why Blue Thunder will keep it frozen.
What's with the costume?
Costume?
Mitchie, she's wearing a formal dress.
No, she's in a jeweled gown of silver and gold.
And she's also wearing glass slippers.
Haven't you guys ever read "Cendrillon?"
"Aschenputtel?"
No?
She's dressed like Cinderella, guys... the old-school, original Cinderella.
And she's also next to the pureed pumpkin.
But that could just be a coincidence.
Okay, Mitchie, come back to reality.
Detective Villa, we found this on the table in the foyer.
Ooh, look at that.
I'm not gonna say I told you so, 'cause us Mendelsons have, uh, historically great self-control.
Well, you were right, so you can say it.
All right, you know what?
I'm just gonna talk to the woman who found the body.
I'm sure there's a sane answer to all of this.
Ashley was a waitress at the company I own,
Catering by Collins.
- Why was she at your house?

I was supposed to be out of town until Sunday, but I came home a couple hours ago and found her dead in the freezer.
I have experience with food, so I knew I shouldn't move her.
I don't want to sound crass, but I didn't want to defrost the chicken.
No, you did the right thing, Ms. Collins.
- Okay.

Why are you home early from the trip?
There was a fire at my business I needed to deal with.
Maybe if I'd been home sooner, I'd...
Do you know of any reason why Ashley would be in such formal attire?
Yeah, my colleague seemed to think she was dressed as Cinderella.
She was dressed as Cinderella.
Ashley was a children's character entertainer.
It was one of her other jobs.
I'm sorry, a what?
She dressed up as fictional princesses to entertain at birthday parties.
Glass slippers and a fancy dress.
It always equals Cinderella.
I mean...
I told you so.
Ashley must have been going to or coming from a job at a birthday party when she was killed.
Either that or she was in a costume 'cause it's laundry day.
Look, I need a cause of death, ASAP.
- And if you say it was a poison apple...

So, unfortunately, it's gonna take at least 24 hours to prepare the body for autopsy.
We can't cut into her while she's rock solid, and we can't swab because the frost could interfere with the results.
Okay, so what can we do?
We can thaw.
- Hey, Cap.

I wasn't expecting to see you for a couple days.
Ah, Daisie cut the cruise short because Marcos is back.
So, she hasn't seen him in over a year.
Oh, yeah, I met him yesterday.
I stopped by to see Villa.
Seems like a good kid... respects authority but isn't a doormat.
It seems like I'm the only one who hasn't had the pleasure of meeting the prodigal son.
- Yeah, well.

Hey.
Just getting my finances in order,
Trying to figure out what to do with all the money my old man left me.
Precaution, in case something happens during the kidney transplant.
I thought Rosie put the kibosh on you being a donor.
Rosie needs a kidney.

So he's gonna get my kidney.
End of story.
What, you gonna force him?
Like, is he gonna wake up in a tub full of ice, but he's not missing a kidney.
He has a new one?
You know, since you're done vacationing... here.
Why don't you get back to work?
Get caught up on Villa's latest case.
She's about to talk to the family now.
We're very sorry for your loss.
My sister and brother-and-law died when Ashley was 9.
I took her in, raised her like a daughter.
She just wanted to help people, especially children, because so many people helped her after her parents died.
That's why she was studying early childhood education, so she could be an elementary-school teacher.
Well, she was house-sitting, waitressing, and princessing to pay for school?
She was also a babysitter, a dog walker, a tutor, even.
I once got her a job at the nursery where I work.
She lasted a total of two days.
Yeah, and she did not have a green thumb.
Is this Ms. Collins' fault?
Did she not maintain the freezer properly?
Actually, this wasn't an accident, Mrs. Benjamin.
It was a homicide.
It's likely Ashley knew who her killer was.
She was house-sitting, so her routine was disrupted, and the murderer had to know where she'd be.
And there was no sign of forced entry.
That's impossible.
Ashley was the kindest, most generous person.
Who would want to kill her?
Well, that's what we're gonna find out.
We're on our way to Ashley's place now.
But I promise you, we'll keep you updated.
It just hit 11:00 a.m.
Okay, Pipp, raise the temperature in the tent from 2 degrees to 6 degrees.
You sure you're okay in there, Mitchie?
- You're turning kinda blue.

Us Mendelsons have an extremely high tolerance for cold...
- All right.

What's the core body temperature?
Negative 2 degrees.

Her extremities will thaw out first, so we should be able to test her fingers and toes by late this afternoon.
She looks so peaceful.
Don't you usually have more X-rays than that?
Well, between the frozen state of her body and the metallic interference from all the beads on her dress, the other X-rays are too clouded.
Uh, I'm gonna start cutting her dress, guys.
Boy, are you all right in there?
You're turning kinda blue.
So, her X-rays are clean.

Personally, I don't get the whole girls' princess-obsession thing.
Waiting around for some slow-ass prince to save them?
Uh, no thanks.
As I recall, my dear, you really wanted a lot of that princess paraphernalia when you were younger...
Dolls and posters, the books, the movies.
Yeah, I liked princesses.
But not because I wanted to be one.
'Cause I wanted to be with one.
They were cute.
And all their problems could be solved with kisses.
Found something.
This... was stuck between her dress and her body.
Oh.

If we're lucky, it'll belong to our killer.
See if the root is attached.

Hey, Villa.
On my way.
- Her parents?

That was the last photo Ashley took with them before they died.
Villa, come take a look at these.
Looks like everyone loved Ashley.
Everyone under the age of 8.
Did she not have any close friends her own age?
Like a boyfriend or anything?
No, not really.
Ashley was just always more comfortable around kids.
- They really loved her.

Thank you.
And um, thank you for letting me come and take Shadow.
Nothing in here points to a killer or motive.
Ah, well, there's a motive.

Gets everywhere and there's no cleaning it up.
Hey, just got off the phone with Ashley's boss at Once Upon a Birthday.
Ah, that's a great name for a company.
He confirmed that Ashley had a job the day she died.
Apparently, the client called to complain that Ashley got into a fight with a coworker,
- a Leanne Forrest.

Boss wasn't really sure.
He have any idea where we can find her?
There you go.

You hear from Daisie?
I thought I'd get the call for the big reunion by now.
I'm sure it hasn't happened yet.
Marcos is avoiding my mom.
- You gonna give her a heads up?

At least not until I figure out what's going on.
¿Entiende?
Okay, so which one of these ladies is Leanne?
100 bucks says that's her right there.
You're a psychic now?
No, I just got off the phone with Mitchie.
He said the long blonde hair that we found on the body was synthetic, from a wig.
So I'm guessing with that length and color...
We're looking for Rapunzel.
Leanne Forrest?
Rapunzel.
She... she actually meant Rapunzel.
Right, "Rapunzel."
Uh, can we have a word with you?
Oh, but we were just about to sing a song, and that's my favorite thing to do.
- If you could just wait one moment.

See that?

I have a few questions about where you were two days ago.
Is Rapunzel in trouble?
What?

Rapunzel's about to help us catch an evil villain.
- Yeah, I know.

I was locked away in the tower two days ago, like I always am.
Dame Gothel never lets me out unless I'm to celebrate a very special birthday like today.
We're celebrating Princess Stephanie.
Yay!
If you could just give me a minute to finish up.
You know what?

Thank you.
Let's all go sing "Happy Birthday"!
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
Cha-cha-cha!
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
You fought with Ashley the day she died.
And we found your wig hair on her body.
See our dilemma?
So you think I killed her?
That's crazy.
Uh, I mean, I'm practically a princess.
You're a college dropout, up to her neck in student-loan debt, who spends her time playing dress-up.
- What was the fight about?

Nothing.

I was running late for a toy-store opening, so I asked her to cover for me.
You know, say I was in the bathroom or something.
And she wouldn't do it.
She was such a stickler for the rules.
So I simply reminded her that she owed me after I covered for her before.
Well, how'd you cover for Ashley before?
We were working a kid's birthday party, and I caught her flirting with one of the dads.
You got to be careful with them because they can get touchy-feely.
Anyway, uh, then I saw her take out her cell phone and give her number to the guy's daughter,
Which is so against company policy.
- But I did not report her.

Sounds like Ashley wanted the kid
- to pass her number to the dad.

You said Ashley doesn't break the rules, so...
I have it... tha-that's my point.
Ashley pretended to be on some moral high ground, but at the end of the day, she was really just a gold digger.
Just for the record,
I never got touchy-feely with any of the princesses at my kids' birthday parties.
- I believe you.

Slade is still planning to donate his kidney to you.
Thought I made myself clear when I refused his offer.
I'd do the same thing.
- Thanks for understanding.

I mean, if I was Slade, and I could give you an organ,
I wouldn't let you turn it down.
You really need to rethink this thing.
Yeah, I appreciate the advice, but I'm not gonna let the people that I care about risk their life for mine.
Okay, so if you and Ashley never came to blows, why was your hair on her body?
Florida is the costume and theme-park state.
I can name 20 other Rapunzels running around out there.
That hair was not mine.
Oh.
Ow-ow-ow!

I need a sample for proof.
- Villa, I have news.

We... n-normally, I say "ladies first,"
but since my news is bad news, I'm gonna get it out of the way.
The hair found on Ashley did not match the hair sample from Rapunzel's wig.
Okay, forget about Rapunzel.
Based on what Leanne said about Ashley giving out her number,
I got a copy of her phone records.
Ashley called 911 the night before she died.
Listen.
911.

Hello?

Are you in trouble?

911.

Hello?

Hello?
Sorry.

Was that a car door slamming?
She was headed somewhere.
Somewhere that she didn't feel safe.
Where'd this call originate?
Dispatch triangulated it to the 3900 block of Sun Dance Road.
Okay, Ashley got three phone calls from the same number just 15 minutes before she called 911.
And that number is registered to a Dale Bartram.
Anybody want to guess where Dale lives?
- 3900 block of Sun Dance Road.

And Dale has a record.
Public intoxication and neglect of a child.
He was arrested after he passed out outside a restaurant while with his 8-year-old daughter, Tiffany.
Leanne said that Ashley gave her number to a child.
What if Tiffany was that child?
She called Ashley.
And said something that prompted Ashley to call 911.
Yeah, well, maybe Dale graduated from child neglect to child abuse, and the kid confided in Ashley.
She wasn't flirting at that party.
She was monitoring Dale because she thought he was hurting his kid.
She confronted him, and that's what got her killed.
Enough of the hypotheticals.
Get Dale in here now.

Okay.
I know what you're gonna say.
Well, apparently I need to say it again.
Well, if it makes you feel better, go ahead.
It's not gonna make a difference.
- Oh, looks like you're making progress.

Only the extremities have thawed.
That's why I've drawn blood from the foot so I can run a tox.
And I am swabbing
♪ Nasal cavities, fingers, and toes ♪
♪ Fingers and to-o-o-es ♪
Mom... you're hovering.
I'd say she's gandering.
Observing.
You may need me to get more involved while Beaumont is recovering from his surgery.
That is so not necessary.
Um...
Is that Villa's mom?
- Daisie.

I'm thrilled to finally meet you.
Oh, my goodness!
Um, nice to meet you too.
Beautiful.
Look at this skin.

Well, now I really am thrilled to meet you.
Pero mira, I'm looking for Annalise.
And she's not returning my calls.
So my papi Hornstock
- said that she was here with Rosie.

Beaumont and Annalise aren't here.
Oh.
Okay.
Um, I'll let you get back to work.
Would you like a cup of tea?
I'm a very good listener.
And I know a thing or two about difficult children.
I would love that.
- Come.

My Annalise, I think she's, um... she's hiding something from me.
You know, mothers, we always know, right?
And my guess is her brother, because he's been avoiding me.
Ashley has capsaicin in her nasal passages.
- What is capsaicin?

Oh, that's the kick in chili peppers.
I love chili peppers.
She's right, but it only means one thing when it's found in the nasal passages.
- Pepper spray.

She also had traces of ultraviolet dye around her cuticles.
Sometimes pepper sprays are laced with dye.
You know what?
You're right, because Annalise bought me one of those things, and it was mixed with this green stuff, and it would get all over my hands when I used it.
It was a real pain in the you-know-what.
So if there was dye in the pepper spray, then Ashley probably got it on her hands
- when she sprayed someone.

The attacker probably has no idea they're covered in it.
And it doesn't come off easily.
I got to tell Rosie.
Well, this is exciting.
Come.
My mom knows something's up.
She won't stop calling.
Shouldn't you just tell her that Marcos is avoiding her?
Shouldn't you tell your mother that you're not taking Slade's kidney?
I asked you first.
Well, I don't want to hurt her.
Look, you avoided Daisie for months when you first moved back to Miami.
- You guys moved past that.

You know, growing up,
Marcos and Ma were thick as thieves.
She was always one of those diva princesses, relying on a man to do things for her.
And after Dad left, Marcos let her rely on him.
- Then why won't he see her?

Let's just, uh, talk about something else.
All right, all right, let's do that.
Like, princesses.
I mean, come on now.

Not one of them?
Ooh, I liked Xena.
Ah, okay, okay.

Yeah.
Look, I've been surrounded by strong women my entire life, but I still believe in chivalry.
I still believe that you can always lend a helping hand to a damsel in distress.
See, that's the thing.
Fairy tales set women up for failure.
I mean, Prince Charming doesn't exist.
It's not like every woman can have their own Rosie.
What?

- Whatever.

I want to hear you say it.
This is it.
What's that for?
Our forensic smoking gun.
Hi.

This is my associate Dr. Rosewood.
We'd like to ask you a few questions about Ashley Morrison.
I don't think I know anybody by that name.
You mind if we come inside?
Thank you.
Does, uh, this woman look familiar to you?
Dale?
What did you do now?
We have a few questions about this woman.
Do you know her?
Yes, she worked a few parties our daughter attended.
- But we don't know her personally.

What the hell are you doing?
Do you mind turning off all of your lights, please?
What?

Rosie, this better be good.
Did you know that ultraviolet dye is added to pepper spray to aid police in identifying criminals.
It can only be seen... with a blacklight.
So... looks like you did know Ashley... personally.
You hurt your daughter, Dale
You threatened her so she'll keep quiet.
Ashley found out.

And when you attacked her, she defended herself with pepper spray.
Later, you tracked her down and killed her.
No, this is all a big misunderstanding.
I would never hurt my daughter.
I only lied about Ashley because I didn't want my wife to know the truth.
What?

I think she already knows that.
- Why did Ashley come to your house?

You're not helping your case.
I wasn't hurting anyone.
Tiffany was confused.
I think she saw me smack the nanny on the ass a few times, and she misunderstood the gesture.
You're... you're sleeping with the nanny?
Ashley knocked on my door and demanded to see Tiffany and our nanny, Beth.
I-I didn't recognize her, so I told her to get lost.
And she pepper sprayed me and pushed her way inside.
Beth explained to her what happened, then...
Ashley got really embarrassed and left.
And I never saw her again.
We need an alibi, Dale.
Yep.

I was with the nanny.
Yeah, Dale's alibi checked out, so we cut him loose.
And look, it's not exactly square one, Cap.
We'll have another suspect soon.
Okay.
All right, goodnight.
Seriously?
You're just gonna sneak out with all your things?
Nah, I just...
I figured it'd be kinda cramped with me and Ma staying here,
- so I'm just...

Just stop it.
- You're avoiding Mom.

Yes, you are.
You know it and I know it.
And you're gonna tell me why.
You're home!
I can't do this right now, Ma.
Donna said he's gonna come around.
Donna...
- Donna Rosewood?

- When... when did you two...

And she told me that Rosie pushes her away too, especially when it comes to his health.
So I told her that he wasn't gonna take that kidney from el Capitán.
You told her?
Mija, she needed to know.
This is life or death.
And we both want our children to be healthy... and safe.
Mitchie, you taking the early shift now?
Actually, I-I went ahead and took all the shifts.
I've been checking on the victim every hour, and I can now report that the body is fully thawed.
Good.

The body will decompose twice as fast now that it's thawed.
That's exactly my thinking.
I've prepped the body, and Pippy's on her way.
Mitchie, you okay?
You're more subdued than usual.
Yeah, I was up all night.
I've seen a sleep-deprived Mitchie.
It's not that different than the well-rested Mitchie.
I read through the victim's file last night to stay awake.
I didn't realize she'd been orphaned at such a young age and raised by her aunt.
Reminded you of losing your mother and father so young.
Ashley and I share a very similar past.
And just brought everything back up for me.
I mean, she's with her parents now.
I guess that's a sliver of a silver lining.
But she deserved a happier ending than this.
There's only one thing we can do to give that to her.
We have to find out who killed her, Rosie.
And that's just what we're gonna do.
Well, Rosie was right.
If Ashley died of hypothermia,
I would see dark-brown lesions on the mucosa of her stomach.
And I don't.
So, she must've been dead before she was frozen, you guys.
There's non-displaced fractures on the left anterior-lateral surfaces of ribs three through seven.
She sustained a blow from a blunt object.
A blunt object with a rounded edge.
Rib shears.
See how the breaks start on the anterior surfaces, moves to the lateral surfaces, then back again?
- See that?

Oh, look at that.
- Her left lung is collapsed.

She suffered from a traumatic pneumothorax.
She would've suffocated in less than 10 minutes.
Based on this fracture, whatever hit her rib and collapsed her lung weighed less than 20 pounds.
It's also between 12 and 18 inches in diameter.
- Could it be a statue?

I need to get back to the crime scene.
Spread out and shout if you find something.
Will do.
Okay... so spoiler alert... your mother knows that you canceled the transplant.
Well, thank you for the heads up.
I'll just call her and reassure her that I'll be okay.
Rosie, you're not gonna be okay.
What you're doing, it's crazy.
Excuse me, but I think you were supposed to have my back, right?
I mean, your exact words were
"I'm not worried.

I know.

But I've learned that running from the truth doesn't help anyone.
Is that a bead?
Some just like these were found on the victim's dress.
What are the odds that the killer came in here, planning to use this ugly statue to commit murder?
Unless something went wrong.
And the killer had to improvise.
Hey.

So I think I'm gonna track down your brother and, uh, have a conversation...
Look, I appreciate that you care about Ma, but just leave Marcos to me, okay?
Hey, who's the man?
Rhetorical question.

Okay, are you gonna share, or are you just gonna pat yourself on the back all day?
All right, so I found the victim's skin cells at the base of the statue.
I also found traces of fresh nicotine at the top of the statue where the killer held it to use it as a weapon.
Well, didn't you say the homeowner, Veronica, smoked like a chimney?
Yeah, but she was out of town at the time.
The only reason why she came back early
- is because of the fire at her office.

What if she never left town?
Maybe she asked Ashley to house-sit because she knew she'd need an air-tight alibi.
So, we pulled this security footage from the building across the street from Catering by Collins.
That's a very large fire.
I'm assuming whoever's responsible avoided the security cameras?
They didn't need to.

This is from the back of the building.
Now, wait for it.
Veronica has the exact same tattoo.
She pretended to go out of town so she could set fire to her own business.
If she lied about committing one crime, it's a safe bet she lied about committing another.
Veronica Collins?
- Detective Ira Hornstock.

I've already told the police everything I know about Ashley, and I was out of town, so I'm not su...
That is a nice tattoo.
I think I've seen it before.
Yes.
Here you go.
Would you look at that.
Well, let's see her deny it now.
You can't make me take something I don't want.
Really?
You want to do this now?
- I do.

The chances that you'll find another match are slim to none.
You can take a few days, live in your little fantasy, but the reality is, there's no easy way to get a kidney.
So for you not to die, somebody else has to die, or somebody has to donate.
I'm donating.

You know arson carries a 30-year prison sentence?
Arson?

We checked your finances, and Catering by Collins appears to be in some serious trouble.
Now, rather than declare bankruptcy, you staged a fire to collect the insurance pay out.
And I'm guessing Ashley knew about it.
So you killed her to shut her up.
I may be a lot of things, Detective, but I'm not a murderer.
And besides, Ashley had no idea that I was in debt.
Just the other day, she came to me for financial advice.
She had questions about her trust, wanted to access the funds early.
Tell me more about this trust.
She couldn't access the money until she was 25.
- And it was not small trust, either.

I asked for an investment, but she said she had plans for the money.
Look, I didn't kill Ashley.
I needed money.
And you can't get that from a dead girl.
Well, you don't have to worry about money anymore, not where you're going.
Ashley was gonna turn 25 in 7 months.
What was so pressing that she couldn't wait?
Ashley died before that money was dispersed.
Who gets it now?
We found out about Ashley's trust.
The one you failed to mention?
It was never a secret.
I just didn't think about it.
The lawyers handle the money.
Well, you're about to handle all the money, because you're the secondary beneficiary on the trust.
Now that Ashley's dead, it all goes to you.
You think I killed my niece for money?
Absolutely.
I didn't care about the money.
And even if I did,
I didn't need to kill Ashley to get it.
She offered that to me months ago.
I said no.
Ashley was trying to access her trust early for you?
Why?
She wanted to help me pay my rising medical bills.
But I refused.
Her parents left that money for...
- For her future.

Are you sick?
But no one knows with what.
At first, my doctors thought I had the flu, now they think hyperthyroidism, but I'm not responding to medications.
Excuse me, I'm a doctor.

Now look to your left.

Hmm.
Huh.
Rosie, you planning on leaving us all in suspense or what?
I believe you, Paula.
And I think I might know what's wrong with you.
In order to prove that,
I need you to come back to Magic City Lab so I can run some tests.
Hey.
I'm look for a Detect...
You a cop too?
Ugh.
He's in the bedroom.
- Hornstock, I got your text.

This is a picture of my kid.
Who did this?
You don't recognize your brother's handiwork?
- Marcos?

says Marcos has been living here for four months.
Met him on Craigslist.
He's got everybody.
No, no, no, no.

I'm so...

I don't know what to say.
What the hell?

You want to talk about invasion of privacy?
You're stalking everyone your sister and mother know!
My mother?

Just 'cause you're playing house don't make you family.
You let your real family fall apart, right, man?
Okay, let's get something very clear.
I care about these two women, okay?
And I'm gonna protect them, even if it's from one of their own.
Okay, enough.

Handle this.
- Look, Leese...

- Leese...

You're...
You're stalking my friends?
- My boyfriend?

I just...
I have a hard time talking to people.
You know that.
I thought it'd be easier if I just...
Look, I know it seems crazy, but you got to understand, this is how my mind works, okay?
I just wanted to get to know them.
What more can I say?
You're avoiding Mom.
You're... you're keeping a secret place.
You're doing recon on my friends.
Is there anything else you want to drop on me?
It's complicated, Sis.
- I...

Is that all you have to say?
You know, I thought you might've been angry because you had to grow up too fast after Dad left, but it's... it's clear to me you never grew up at all.
You...
You know, times have changed.
Mom has changed.
And... and you're not even giving it a chance.
You're acting like Dad.
Ooh, uh, I...
I'm feeling a little dizzy.
I'll get you some water.
I can't believe
Ashley was still trying to access her money for me.
Well, you gave her a family when she thought she lost everything.
There's no way she could ever really re-pay you, so her giving you the money for your treatments was her way of saying thank you.
She loved you.
If would've made her feel good to know that she was doing something for you.
Sometimes you just have to let people help.
Sounds like someone should take their own advice.
Uh, all right.
It's what you suspected.
The organic base screen showed a high concentration of nicotine.
Paula, you've been suffering from nicotine poisoning.
How did the doctors miss that?
It's not something the hospitals would test for.
And it's certainly not something they would suspect.
N...

A concentration of nicotine this large probably didn't come from cigarettes.
Does Ashley have any other beneficiaries?
What about you?
Who inherits your money if you die?
Why... why... why are you asking me?
Because whoever killed Ashley was trying to kill you.
And I think we both know who that is.
Huh.
Well, it looks like your kindness towards plants
- doesn't translate to people.

Villa, did you know that nicotine, the most addictive ingredient in cigarettes, is actually from a plant?
That means it's deadly, but it's 100% natural.
Perfect for... an organic pesticide.
But you didn't just use that to kill bugs, did you?
You slipped it into your mother's soup, tea, a little bit every day so that once she died, it looked like she succumbed to a long illness.
You murdered Ashley so her trust would transfer to Paula.
Then once you finally killed your mother...
All of that money would go to you.
No, you don't understand.

We didn't find your prints at the scene, but we did find nicotine.
I suspect that you wore these gardening gloves to commit the murder.
I'm sure we'll find Ashley's DNA on these.
How'd it go down, Gretchen?

You went over.
You thought you'd lure Ashley into the freezer, trap her inside, make the whole thing look like an accident.
But she fought back, and so you had to improvise.
So you grabbed that statue and smashed it down on Ashley's chest.
It takes a special kind of ugly to do what you did.
It wasn't just about the money, okay?
My mom loved Ashley more than she ever loved me, her own biological daughter.
Ashley was always overshadowing me.
She was prettier than me, she was nicer, she was richer, and my mom just doted on her all the time.
Yes, Paula loved Ashley, but that doesn't mean she didn't love you.
You just chose to see it that way.
Get her out of here.
Let's go.
- Can you get this upstairs?

All right, have a good night.
Paula is expected to make a full recovery now that her daughter isn't poisoning her anymore.
This is why I hate money.
It makes people do twisted things.
- Yeah, like what Tawnya did to Rosie.

I mean, Paula's gonna use the money from Ashley's trust to set up scholarships for future teachers.
She's gonna make sure some good comes from all of this.
Well, good work on closing the case.
See you guys tomorrow.
- See you, Cap.

I invited Marcos over for dinner.
Seriously?
He's been sneaking around.

Hornstock, I have to try to get through to him.
I mean, who knows if he'll even show up.
But I can't give up on him.
I just got him back.
Good luck.
Mamita, do I look okay?
Ma, you can never look "okay."
You're too beautiful.
You came.
I don't want to be like Dad.
Hi, Mom.
iEstás tan delgadito!
You have to eat, my love.
- Mira, I made some arroz con pollo.

I haven't had a home-cooked meal in forever.
Well, now I can cook for you any time.
And I was thinking we can go to that cafe that you love.
You know, the one with the little sandwiches and the french fries in the middle?
And we can do a little picnic.
I'm in between jobs, just like you now, so...
Yeah, that'd be great, Ma.

What's the matter?
You're rubbing your... your eye.
Yeah, so?
So you always did that when you have something to get off your chest.
Uh, I'm just...

Nothing.
Hmm?
I know you, Marquito.
Even after all this time, I can read you like a book.
That's why you didn't want to see me, huh?
Because you know Mami's the one that's not gonna fall for your act.
You can talk to us.
There's no judgment here.
Marcos, what is it?
I can't go back to the army.
I messed up, and they gave me a chance to leave on my own without giving me a dishonorable discharge.
- What did you do?

No judgment.

I've been in the army for seven years.
I'm supposed to do what now?
Get a desk job?

Or fix cars?
I didn't want to tell you, Ma, 'cause if I told you, it'd make it all too real.
- And I'm not ready for all that...

Stop.

No.
You're home, and you have your family.
And we're gonna work this out together, okay?
It's gonna be all right, papi.
It's gonna be okay.
You know, Paula inspired me.
I decided to use my father's money to start a program for teenagers who age out of Saint Mels.
Something to give them a head start in life.
You know, I'm not surprised.
When you first came to EMPD, you could've cleaned house.
You could've fired Hornstock, could've zone in on Villa, but you didn't.
That should have been my first clue that you cared more than you let on.
Then in that hostage situation,
I watched you offer your life in exchange for everyone else's.
And you meant it.

My point is you're an important part of the family now.
And I would never let a family member risk their life to save my own, especially when I did this to myself.
Here's where you're wrong.
I'm not some shining knight.
I've got demons in spades.
But, somehow, being around you, around the family you've created, helps me keep them all at bay.
And you don't want to see the person I turn into three months from now if you're not around.
So I think we can agree that we're each trying to save a life, but you are mistaken if you think it's your life I'm trying to save.
- What's this?

If I'm gonna take your kidney, you got to start taking better care of it.
