Previously on Empire...
You and Nessa are out.
You two know each other?
And then we take it from him.
Your melody with my arrangement... that's what's beautiful.
Cookie, sweetheart, when my family decides to shoot, your entire family will burn to the ground.
We have received reports of child endangerment.
(all shouting)
It's the Dubois.

(man coughs)
I'm sorry, what?
It might be best if the Lyon family speaks first.
Okay, lady, we know you got connections
y'all been peddling to the rest of these politicians
Because I don't have all day for this, okay?
Okay, well, here I come.
(scoffs)
this is about a child.
So, it's understandable that tempers are hot.
Now, the Lyon family has reason to believe that the Dubois family had something to do with Child Protective Services coming to their home and taking the baby, Bella.
A heinous act, that has the own child's father,
Hakeem Lyon, too distraught to even be here today.
Now, we demand that the child be returned home.
If that can happen, everything will be right as rain.
Our family had nothing to do with whatever happened to your baby.
My cousin, Angelo, lost his career
Ezekiel, Snoop's banker.
Angelo was destined for even greater...
Let's do it, let's do it.
(overlapping arguing) ...as everyone thinks your family is!
Please just shut up!
I do not care who did what to whom!
I just want my daughter back.
Please.
Please, just help me find my child.
I am so sorry.
I think it's terrible that your child was taken.
Please. (scoffs)
You are so much better than the company you keep.
And yes, we have connections.
Yeah, I know.
Connections born from generations of serving our community... a community which you have chosen to represent very differently, I might add.
(Cookie clicks tongue)
All right, all right, all right.
Look, look, I-I see where all this is going.
All right, so y'all got a little power in you.
You know how to play a little hit back.
And y'all fancy.
But when we hit, we hit real hard.
I have no idea what happened to your child.
So, y'all really want to go down that road?
(chuckles)

It's been 30 minutes.
It's gonna work out.
Paying for all the terrible things that I've done.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Thirsty said he gonna get her back.
So, I've talked to my supervisor and asked him to cross-reference the name in the database, so...
What do you mean, "I'm sure"?
W-What she means is, we can't seem to find your daughter.
What?
Can't or won't?
I understand this is confusing.
If you would please just come into my office...
I was told that the child would be released to her mother today.
I understand that and I'm sorry.
This is very odd.
Several motions have been filed, but I can't tell by who.
Any one of these motions would take at least a month to untangle.
Well, you better untangle it.
From what I can see here, you're not gonna see that child for quite some time.
Last name Lyon, first name Bella.
I want my daughter, man!
So, what you gonna do, go in Child Protective Services guns a-blazing?
(sighs) Dubois' is a type of power we ain't never seen before.
No, we are a monster they've never imagined dealing with.
Well, they certainly are strong, and... they stick together, that's for sure.
Seeing how tight they are just reminds me of how weak we are when we're divided.
And we got to do better.
We got to do better, Lucious.
- (doorbell rings) - (sighs)
Let's clean this up, 'cause if that's Hakeem, and he sees this stuff, he's gonna spin out.
(bell jingles)
You were right.
I should have never let them take the baby.
(sighs)
Okay, um...
Lucious, it doesn't make sense that a baby could completely disappear.
I don't know.
I mean, it's got to be the Dubois.
That's why they can't get away with this.
All right, apparently we underestimated how powerful this family is.
So what do we do?
Where's my daughter, Mom?
I don't know.
Bad news is, is that we're gonna have to, uh, distance most of the Lyon family from the child.
Okay, then why is that?
Because on paper, all of you are unfit.
I knew it, I knew it.
Please.
This whole family is sick.
Hey, Anika, y-you two are still married, but if we can expedite the divorce, it would show in good faith that you're making an asserted effort to distance yourself from the family and that will benefit us.
Just, Thirsty, make it happen.
(Thirsty clears throat)
So, I need everybody to keep their lives on track, so that she's coming back to a strong family.
We got to get our minds right.
We need to acknowledge the fact that we're all here together, for Bella.
So, we know how to come together.
Yeah.
Which means we're more fit than anybody.
One way or another.

Look, ladies, I'm-a tell you the truth,
I love everything that y'all are doing.
Problem is: it's the wrong show.
They've got so much Cirque in there, that they're missing the Soleil.
They're missing the soul of the this whole thing.
I need it to be... this, with more of a hip-hop, urban, contemporary kind of thing,
Why is everybody leaving?
I-I'm looking to see the whole
Inferno extravaganza.
You'll see the Inferno extravaganza when either you become a part of the show or you pay like everybody else.
Yeah, well, one step at a time, not five, big homie.
And?
It's fire.
I knew you was gonna love it.
Why are we doing the same song on two separate albums?
It's kind of superfluous, right?
You know, so I think I want to remix mine.
Nah, man, I don't know about you remixing the song.
But what I'm gonna do is have a young emcee that's representing me on this thing.
Nah, nah, see, slow down.
There's no emcee on the song.
I'm gonna set up a session for you to meet this cat.
When I say he's incredible,
I'm talking about incredible.
Why you look all despondent now?
(chuckles)
Listen, don't call my stuff soft.
And this is not gonna get Lucious to where I need him to be.
You don't know that.
Yes, I do.
Lucious is not sweatin' it, and this Vegas deal is worth billions.
So I gave him the basics of your plan, but, uh,
- we both have concerns about that tight window. - (chuckles)
Baby, I done climbed through many a tight windows in my day.
Speaking of which, uh, are we doing what we talked about, about getting my grandbaby back?
Look, we all know it's Vegas or bust, right?
So what we got to do is turn this album into a Vegas production.
What about Inferno?
Oh, child, they already falling' behind.
You know, Lucious as bad as Dr. Dre when it comes to trying to be a perfectionist.
Shine, you need to get us in to see Marcone.
Yes.
What does that do for me?
We secure our place, or we'll all be out.
How do you not understand that?
I understand you need to drop your tone, Andre.
All right, look, look, look, look, if we switch out
Inferno for our show, I promise you, Shine,
And I'll make Lucious crawl.
(sighs) Boy, this is not about punishing your daddy, this is about family, and that woman got your daddy twisted and that ain't good for none of us.
Well, my last name's not Lyon.
(sighs)
Will you, for once, take your mind out of the gutter and think big?

Dad, nobody told you how to deal with your father getting shot, so don't tell me how to deal with taking a bullet for mine.

Lucious is billing it as performances by all of Empire's artists, and he doesn't have Jamal Lyon.
Empire's biggest star.
Not to mention, the show is struggling.
Lucious doesn't like the script, so...
So what are you offering?
Look, we all know people come to Vegas in search of something special.
Well, I want to give it to them.
I have an Empire show that's better than Inferno.
It's called Jamal Lyon's When Cookie Met Lucious.
(laughs)
And it tells the story of the first family of hip-hop.
Performed and produced by all of the Lyons.
You're gonna get me Jamal and Lucious?
Yes, I...
Uh, yes.
Yes.
You see the chitter-chatter on twitterverse.
They can't keep Coocious out of their mouths.
They want to know our love story.
They want to know how we built that Empire.
That could be huge.
But Lucious isn't here.
So how do I know he's on board?
Who wouldn't?
Who doesn't like making money?
It's Vegas, baby. (laughs)

The Dubois family is ready to put this standoff behind us.
Which is why we're recommending libel sanctions against Hakeem Lyon.
We should let it blow over.
The boy is understandably upset, but we didn't have anything to do with CPS taking that baby away from the family.
(laughs)
Such a disgrace.
A setback for the entire race, with their degrading lyrics and thuggish behavior.
I won't lie to you,
I had nothing to do with that baby being taken.
But I can't say that I feel an ounce of sympathy for them.
Okay, but we can agree that we cannot let this escalate into a full-on Hatfields and McCoys situation,
You need to free Bella, you dirty Dubois.
What's this?

What'd you say about the Hatfields and the McCoys?
Ma.

You were still out of line for bringing Lucious in on this deal.

You were just a boy.
You would've run out in the middle of that mess and got killed, too.
Yeah, like...
It's like Jamal, when he was in the same situation, you know, he didn't even hesitate to jump in front of that bullet.
He just...
Ah, I'll tell you this.
For whatever I can or did say about you, that boy, Jamal, is special.

You did that, Dwight.

What do you mean, us?
Yeah, I relented.
I'm gonna do the song your way.
Why?
I'm sick and tired of fighting your ass.
And I realized the truth is
I was fighting against the natural course of things.
I mean, every son takes over after his father.
When my daddy died I took over from him and... point is, same way my music was Empire's legacy, your music will be Empire's legacy, and it might as well start with this song.

Look, there's something I need to tell you.
When Cookie Met Lucious is going to be on our stage in Vegas.
I already talked to Marcone, he agreed, it's done.
Cookie.
Look, this is what the fans want, Lucious, me and you together.
We need to come together, Lucious.
I don't think that's going to happen.
You get the show in Vegas and Empire gets the casino.
Because Marcone called and told me about your little conversations.
So I thought I'd fly into town and make sure Lucious and I were still on the same page.
We are.
Inferno is the Vegas deal, Cookie.
And Inferno will be the show to launch Empire Casino.
Jamal and I recorded a track this morning.
It's one that's gonna be on Inferno.
So, you're saying no to something that could bring this family together?
You do know that, Lucious.
You know I love my family, Cookie... (scoffs) ...but I've made my choice.
I did 17 years for you.
Thank you for that, but I'll take it from here.
Hey.
I've been calling you all day.
Where's your phone?
My family needed me.
So, When Cookie Met Lucious, that's actually happening?
I told Cookie I'd think about it.
Okay, so then what's your plan, Dre?
Because I know you don't expect me to just sit and watch from the audience.
You can do whatever you want.
It's between me and my family.
You and your family?
That's right.
I thought I was family.
Your mother disrespected me.
And I thought you were strong enough to take it.
Tory Ash stole a song from me and you didn't do a damn thing about it.
I told you, that's how I do business.
That's how you do business.
This was never about me, was it?
This was about you.
You needed an artist that you could control.
Somebody whose career boosted yours and you just, you choose me, huh?
Could've worked out for you.
(scoffs)
It still can.
You're crazy.
Am I?
(gasping)
