- What better place to test a passion potion thantheuptightlittleHamlet ofmeadeville?
- So what, this is some sort of sex plague?
Arthur-- - come on.
[Grunts]

- Christopher, wherever you're keeping him, he'sa goodcoptoo .
- I knew you wouldn't abandon me, buddy.
You got your boy on the inside.
- Listen.

- Guys, "blood drive's" getting picked up.
We got future episode outlines.
Wegotairdates.

I've rerouted the next leg to take you right past it, but if you're the last one across that finish line, rules still apply.
["Whosaidyou'refree" bymidnightyouth]
-¶ I wantayounglove ...¶
- [screaming]
¶¶
- we only have one shot at this.
We gotta race balls out, build up an early lead so we have enough time.

So we find claireview and bust Karma out of there and haul ass across the finish line before our heads explode.
- Pretty solid exposition.

¶¶
- so, um...
About last night.
I mean, with us.
I was under the influence.
So I just don't want things to get, you know, weird out there on the road.
- No, no, no weirdness.

- We're, you know, got it on lock.
I'm--I'm dialed in.
So relax, Barbie.

But only because I'm in a kick-ass mood today.
I'm gonna see my baby sister.
- I just think we make a good team, and I don't wanna mess that up.
- You really think we make a good team?
- Yeah, I think we complement each other.
Sort of the way a left-brain, right-brain work together.
You know, you're tough and street-smart, and sort of, uh...
A murderer.

[Engines turning over]
- [Grunts]
[Rockmusic]
- What do--what are you- you make it too easy.
Lighten up, Barbie.
We've just got grenades in our heads, driving blood-drinking cars through the wasteland in order to find Karma.
Piece of cake.

- Potentially winning?

That we're doing it together.
- Oh, that too.

It's like we turned back the clock.
- Yep.
Before you started killing on your own.
In the bathroom with the handle of a hairbrush.
[Laughing] Water running like I can't hear what's going on in there.

[Sighs] We're gonna be a real homicidal couple again.
This is just super.

Who are you talking to?
- Nobody, baby.
I got some work stuff to take care of before my shift starts.
It's like we never get a break, you know?
- I do not.
Security guards appear to do very little.
- Wow.

Agree to dis'.
¶¶
- your behavior is strange.
You have more swagger.
Your body language is that of an Alpha primate.
- Last night, a lot of things changed between us, baby.
- You're referring to our intercourse?
- Totally.
Oh, hey, might be home late tonight.
Might grab a drink after work so don't wait up.
- [Distorted voice] Unacceptable.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Relax.
[Tensemusic]
We took things to a new level.

Emotional levels.

We're, like, vulnerable to each other's needs now.
So there'll be times when you're gonna lean on me and then other times... ¶¶ when I'm not gonna come home and do what the fuck I want.
[Beeping]
- Yes, dear.
¶¶
- really?

I have no reason not to trust you.
¶¶
- really?
Okay.
So I'll be back later.
- I look forward to it.
Have a lovely day.

If we keep this pace we should be fine.

Okay.

Don't brake!

¶¶
- [humming]
- Find me, you bitch.
[Grunting]
- Aah.
[Both screaming]
¶¶
[both breathing heavily]
- That was way too close.
- On the bright side, we're in first place now.
What's wrong with looking on the bright side?
Whoa!

- I can't see.

- We got this.

- I'm a great backseat driver.
Just ask Christopher.

- I don't know how long i can keep this up.
- Okay, just keep it straight.
¶¶ what're they doing?

- Oh, shit, slow down.

More.

- We can't.

- We can't!

Stop--you gotta hit the brake!

Arthur, no!
[Tires squeal]

[Mechanical whirring]
¶¶ you!
You were on stage the night Arthur disappeared.
- I'm sorry but if you'd like a signed photo you'll have to send a self-addressed stamped envelope to 5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5- where is he?

In my capable hands.
- [Grunts]
Where's Arthur?
- Is that who you're really looking for down here, Christopher?

I thought you'd joined heart enterprises for the robot pussy.
- How'd you know about that?
- How's that investigation going, constable?
Hmm?
- Shut up.

- Aha.
I suspect trust isn't what you're sharing.
You know, she's watching us right now through that new eye of yours.
Hello?
Hello.

[Exhalesslowly]
- [Grunts] Stop it!
[Dramaticmusic]
¶¶
- say hello to the misses.
¶¶
- so, beautiful.
My name is Carolina.
Do you know where we are?
This is majora.

They call us barbarians, but it's not exactly barbaric, is it?
The seedmakers abandoned this resort because it didn't produce enough cash for them.
The penny...
- [Grunts]
- And the penis...
- [Grunts]
- Are all they care about.
¶¶ follow me.

- [grunting]
[Electricity crackling] - [Grunting]
All right!
¶¶
[soothing music playing]
¶ ¶
- take it off.
- The world went to hell so you opened a Burke Williams?
- Males roll in the dirt like pigs, doesn't mean we have to.
- Look, I don't have time for this.
I need to go get my sister.
- You'll find many sisters here, grace.
- My real sister.
- Take a seat.
- [Grunting]
- Sit down.
- Relax.
When I get back, you and i will have a nice, long chat, and you can tell me all about why you can't stay here in paradise.

Oh, god.
[Exhales]
¶¶ [retching]
[Panting]
What the fuck?
[Retching]
Oh, thank god.

I'll never come in here again.

[Retching]
- What do you want from me, domi?
The only language I speak is English.
- Not you language, idiot.

Did you read any of the books that I gave you?
- Oh, yeah, that's what we need.
Another book to tell me how to make "kiss coupons"
or my--my "seven daily marriage affirmations."
- It doesn't work if you don't try.
No wonder we can't make any progress.
You're emotionally immature.
- You don't even have emotions!
The doctor said so!

- It's not my fault those books are a scam.
All you do is treat me like a kid, telling me what to do all the time.
- I wouldn't have to if you read a book that told you how to be a man.
- I'd like to get out now.
- Can't stop.

Besides, if I left you behind, your head would blow up.
More importantly, so would mine.
- Good, because I'd rather be a smear on the highway than have to ride another mile with a...

- A what, cliff?

Say it.

- Well, I was stupid enough to marry you!
- [Gasps]
Apologize.
- No.

-Enginedisabled.

- Well, then we're gonna sit here until we both die, because there is no way that i am crossing the finish line with a pathetic little loser like you.
[Knocks on window]
Oh.

[Engine revving]
- I suppose this is my fault too.
- [Grunting] - [Breathing heavily]
- Hey.
Water.
Please.

- [Groaning] - [Breathing heavily]
- [Gulping, exhaling]
[Laughs shakily]
Thank the goddamn tits.
Finally, another dude.
Shh.
Don't tell 'em I got this.
Don't get your hopes up.

It only opens this door.
[Indie rock music playing]
¶ ¶
- ¶ catch the rising wind... ¶
- [sighs]
[Exhales, farts]
[Sighs]
Keep the juices flowing, man.
You're gonna need it.

- How long have you been here?
- Uh...

No idea.
¶ ¶
- what do they want from you?
- The only thing they can't get on their own.
[Grunts] The clam ram.
[Laughs softly]
- You mean they...

¶ ¶ [softdramaticmusic]
¶¶
- ah.

[Moans]
- Quiet!
- Ah, oh, god!
[Moaning]
Oh, shit.

[Moaning]
- How are you still alive?
- Eh, it's not so bad.
After a while, it just kind of tingles.
Glad there's another bro here, though.
- Move it.

[Door opens]
- [Grunting]
- [Moaning]
[Door closes]
- Hey, dude...
Welcome to paradise!
[Laughs]
- Can I get a beer?
- [Gasps] Ah.
Ah, I am loving this little pit stop.
- Yeah, we'll see how much you love it when we lose the race and our heads explode.
- Half the field is back on the highway waiting for their cars to turn on.
There's more than enough time to enjoy a bit of majora's hospitality.
And this is so refreshing.

- Like citrus breeze.
- [Grunts]
- [Growls, grunts]
[Funkydramaticmusic]
- Stop right there.
Torrent downloaded from RARBG
- back down.
I understand your resistance, but I want you to tear down your wall and be free.
Everybody's free here at majora.
- [Scoffs] Yeah, what about him?
- Every person here is free.

Um, all right, well, thanks for the wash and wax, but I have places to be, so where's Arthur?
- Is Arthur your male?
- No, he is not my male.
He is my partner, and we have a rehab facility to get to, so if you ladies don't mind- claireview rehabilitation center for women?
- You know it?
- We were inmates there.
Tortured by their guards, their men, but we burned that hell hole to the ground.
So if you're still trying to find claireview, why don't you head up north and look for the crater?
It might still be smoking.
- Another dead end.
[Sighs] Goddamn it, Karma, you never make this easy, do you?
- Karma d'argento's your sister?
- How do you know that name?
- She's been with us since the beginning.
[Suspensefulmusic]
- Take me to her.
- Hey, yeah, uh, sorry.

Uh, could I, uh, you know, get a beer?
- Ah, sorry, man.

- You got a whole coo-- you got a whole cooler.
- We gotta get outta here.

- Don't be such a whiny bitch, dude.
The ladies feed us, give us beer, and all we gotta do is jizz for it.
Basically, we're living the dream.
[Laughs]
- They suck semen out of your body with a milking machine.
- Yeah?
But at least the machine's not allowed to vote.
[Chuckles] Am I right?
Up top...

[Door opens]

Let's go.
[Dramaticmusic]
- Batter up, man.
Let it all hang out.
- Hey, thanks for the beer, man.

- No, I'm a hugger.
- [Laughing]
- [Grunts]
- Whew.

[Groans]
¶¶ [exhales]
[Tensemusic]
¶¶
- we're afraid our audience won't be able to connect to any of these characters.
They barely even wanna fuck 'em.
- Because they're not cool.
Maybe we should have 'em in sunglasses.
- And smoke.

- [Stammers] But there needs to be a story.
Subtle, nuanced characterizations of love, betrayal, and- no one cares about story.
We told you that.
- Yes, tell me again about how my show works.
- We intend to.

They are well below target range.
- My strategic dismemberment counts are 38% above target.
- And your survival rates are too high.
Your per capita maim number's the lowest we've seen in a decade.

I count 15 typos.
[Quietly] 15.
- Impossible.

¶¶ what the fuck, man?

Entirely gratuitous to precise language.
- [Groans, coughs]
- That's enough, slink.
¶¶
I'm sorry.

Here's the top line note.
Between the meadeville fiasco and the escapades at Kane hill, you've lost control.
Our in-house viewership has spiked to an all-time high since you've been absent.
We're going public.
"Blood drive" will air worldwide starting next Wednesday.
- [Laughs]
Finally.
- Without you.
- What?
[Scoffs, stammering] But how?
How?

A work like this, it needs a singular voice, an artist, and I will not compromise my vision for anyone.
- We don't need you.
¶¶
- fine.

Just tell me what you want.
- I want you to die.
- [Coughing, grunting]
- What do you mean, we can't kill him?
What the fuck is a holding deal?
Jesus.
¶¶
I guess we've still got some bullshit to work out.
¶¶
- we owe our lives to your sister.
All of majora exists because of her bravery.
She led the revolt at claireview.
I always knew that I was strong, but when I saw your sister fight, damn.
She made us brave.
She made us all brave.
This is a holy place.
- Wait, where's Karma?
- I'm sorry.
Karma fell in the revolt.
There was nothing I could do.
[Solemnmusic]
- Wait.

¶¶
- Karma's dead.
¶¶
[sombermusic]
¶¶
- how did she die?
- There was so much chaos.
All I know is she fought like a warrior.
- She died alone?
- She died surrounded by her sisters.
- No!
I'm her sister.
¶¶
I should have been here.

[Sighs]
I need to be with her alone.
- Sisters, leave us quickly.
Quickly!
¶¶ can I ask you...
Why'd you two part ways if you were so close?
- It's complicated.
There was this guy that- you see?

Men took Karma away from you, and men took Karma away from me.
- Oh, for fuck sakes, just go!
¶¶
[unintelligible shouting]
[Tensemusic]
¶¶
- aah!

- What you're doing to those men is immoral.
- The seedmakers have food, shelter, a reason to ejaculate.
That's all the beasts need.
[Shouts] - [Grunts]
[Grunts]

[Shouts] - [Grunts]
- Up, up!

¶¶
- domi.
- Your wife's not gonna save you.
She can't fight as well as us.
- Shut up.

It's genetics.
¶¶
- come on, baby.
Get me out of here.
[Tapping in morse code]
[Distant tapping echoes]
[Tapping continues]
- [Gurgling]

- [Gasping]
[Both grunting] [Flesh ripping]
- But it's time i see myself out.
- Hello, honey.
How was your day?
- Oh, you know.
How was yours?
- Acceptable.
[Tensemusic]
¶¶
- I know this is new to both of us.
Relationships are work and shit.
But when you installed my prosthetic eye, did you install some sort of software so you could see what I'm seeing?
And some sort of...
Puke-Cannon?
¶¶
- how else could I trust you?
- Baby, why?
- One of my many objectives is to maintain a level of control over heart assets.
- Is that all I am to you?

'Cause I thought we had something- oh, baby.
I'm an autonomous kinetic intercourse machine.
I have no emotional directives, and even if I did, they would not be affected by filling my semen reservoirs.
¶¶
- but...

- Trust?
Like I could trust you not to snoop around where you don't belong?
¶¶ if you were attempting to manipulate my emotions,
Christopher...
I'm afraid you've only manipulated yourself.
¶¶
I have no emotions.
I feel nothing.
¶¶
- so we'll just keep it casual, i guess.
¶¶ after all...
You're literally just a sex object.
¶¶
- I was too late.
[Sighs]
[Solemnmusic]
All those miles I raced, all those people I killed.
¶¶ none of it mattered.
Is this what it felt like?
¶¶ is this what it felt like when I left you?
[Crying softly]
'Cause it hurts so bad.
[Atv engines revving] - [Screaming]
Grace!

[Dramaticmusic]
[Screaming continues in distance]
¶¶
- I thought she'd come for me.
- Ah, forget about her, man.
You wanna...
I don't know...
Sneak into the seeding room and...
Milk ourselves?
You know, teach 'em a lesson?
- [Grunts]
[Panting]
¶¶ hey there, handsome.

- [Screaming]
Grace!
- Aah!

- No grace, no mercy.
Aah!

- [Grunts]
Why are hot girls always so mean?
[Grunts]

- I can't help that I'm charming.
- All seedmakers, you're all the same.
You killed Karma and you destroyed grace's life!
- No, no, no, you got it all wrong.
I'm trying to help her!
- Leave him alone!
- [Grunts] Ugh.
- I didn't want you to see this, grace, but I'm glad you're here now.
This is the only way you'll be free.

Cut the ropes.

- I got this, Barbie.
¶¶ it's girl's night.
- You're poison, grace.
Brainwashed by the capitalists and the warmongers and the seedmakers.

Your bullshit's already killed one d'argento.
- It wasn't my fault.

- Grace, what're you doing?
- Let's see if you can kill another.
I'm done fighting.

Aah!

-¶ Suicidal¶ [electricity crackles] - [Grunting]
- You're a fucking disgrace to your kind.
- Yeah?

Huh?

An angry, bitter piece of shit that blames the world for her mistakes?
That's not what I taught my sister, and I know that's not what she would want for this place.
- [Grunting]
- You failed her.
Just like I failed her.
'Cause here's the truth.
No matter what shit you've been through, it doesn't justify hurting other people.
He taught me that.
- Then it's a lie.
- No, the truth's the truth, no matter what idiot says it.
¶¶ so come on, Carolina.
I'm dying to see what a washed-up failure like you can do to me.

You want to be punished for your guilt, and I won't be part of it.

Your sister is one of thousands of victims.
¶¶ the truth is... ¶¶
I don't know how I can do this without you anymore.
¶¶ so no more bullshit.
Nothing tying us down.
You and me working together actually stand a chance to fight heart for Karma and all the rest of 'em.
