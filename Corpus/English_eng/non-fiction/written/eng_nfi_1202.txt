Episode Twenty
How come they die in such short time?
I haven't even enjoyed myself.
How come... there's no women?
Your Majesty, Imperial Concubine Wei asks to see you.
Let her come tomorrow.
Your Majesty, please forgive my rudeness.
But this is very important.
I have to come.
It looks as if Imperial Concubine knows the time of day.
Sorry, I was being abrupt.
I have given orders to capture Yan Xun.
Please remit your anger, Your Majesty.
I couldn't bear to see that...
Couldn't bear?
The Wei State is under the danger of destruction,
Our imperial family is in the risk of death.
Could you bear to see that?
Your Majesty,
Yan Xun grew up here in Chang'an.
He is loyal to you.
How do you know?
I would rather kill all just for one.
I've been putting up with them for a long time.
I can't bear it anymore.
The powerful families in Chang'an and your parent family Wei have taken actions to crusade against the traitors of the Wei State.
Uncle, you call Ye'er here.
Do you have something urgent to say?
Look for yourself.
The secret orders that His Majesty gave.
What?

Ye'er earnestly requests for you to stop this.
Listen to you.
What are talking about?
Are you a member of our Wei family?
I know Yan Xun well.
There's no chance that he will conspire against the state¡£
You think that you can tell one person conspires or not?
This is our Wei family's chance of winning honour.
If you have fright, your brothers can take your place.
I don't mean that.
However,
Yan Xun is my friend.
There's no chance that...
Silly!
Today, Song Zifu was killed by His Majesty himself on court.
His Majesty has given his orders, you must obey.
Duke Dingbei has lost his powers.
Yan Shicheng family must die.
Are you going to crusade against rebels of the Wei State and build up establishment?
Or you want to be a nameless dandy forever.
It is up to you.
Huanhuan.
Am I being really stuipid?
I always thought that
Brother Yan Xun's love was me.
However, I found that
I was the only one who thought so until today.
You are in such great happiness.
You have me who love you so much.
How about me?
Who will love me?
Don't be sad, princess.
You have been crying these days.
My heart aches for you.
What will I do,
Huanhuan?
Mother.
Why do you call me back in such hurry?
Tonight, there will be troubled times.
As a prince,
I hope that you can keep out of the affair.
What do you mean by that?
You stay with me.
Don't run around.
Chun'er has locked herself in her room for days.
What's the matter?
Girly stuff...
A little grief is hard to avoid.
Troubled times...
What trouble can it be?
Brother Yan Xun used to take me to eat the iced lotus seed soup.
He would also tell stories and jokes for me.
And he would give many presents to me.
But now...
After the slave girl Xing'er showed up,
Brother Yan Xun and me have drifted apart.
Today, he told me that he regarded me as his sister.
Who wants to be his sister?
Princess.
Open the door.
Yes.
The newly arrived tippy tea this year tastes good.
Song'er, Chun'er.
Do you two think that your extravagant life is what you deserve?
You can eat iced food in such hot weather.
This is the dream of many people.
We are born in the imperial family.
So unlike common people we can live in ease and comfort.
Mother, you said that there was something important to tell us.
However, why are you saying these strange things?
Mother, what do you want to tell us exactly?
I just want to remind you two that you are the prince and the princess of the the Wei State.
You have got the enviable power and wealth.
You can enjoy everything of the entire world.
What is the point of this?
There are too many thing that I don't like, but the one I really want is unavailable.
People always think that the Royal Family is noble, but nobody knows that there are many suffering they can't understand of being the member of the Royal Family.
Song'er, Chun'er,
I want you to remember you can get everything that ordinary people can't get, however, there are two things that ordinary people can get with extreme ease but you must leave behind you.
What are these two things?
Friendship and love.
I want you to forget the affection and not get involved with it.
Why?
Affection is the most difficult thing in this world.
You can't control it while you are in this high position.
If you get involved with it, you will fall into the dilemma between the affection and the duty.
At last, you will bring trouble upon yourself.
It will not only hurt you, but also do nothing but harm to the people around you.
But these are human nuture.
We are not the wood, how could we cut off the thread of love totally?
Yeah.
What is the pleasure of life if there is no good friend or the person you wish for?
Yeah.
Pleasure?
You are the prince and the princess.
The pleasure is not the purpose of your life.
Besides, you can get everything you want in this world except the affection.
Isn't this enough?
You two just stay here well for me.
And you are not allowed to go any place.
Think over what I just said.
Take a look at this map carefully.
All the machinery built in the Jile Pavilion are on this map.
You can see even the exit of escape is very clear.
This is not a normal hairpin, and there is skilful contrivance in it.
Because you can't bring any weapon with you when you get into the Jile Pavilion, so this is the only thing you can bring with.
Come on.
Get up.
Go.

Come on.

Move, now.
Go.
Move.

Go.

Please let us go.
I don't want to die.
Move.
I have youger sisters and brothers at home.
Hurry up.
Move.
Come on.
Come on.
Please let me come back.
Why are you crying?
I will kill the one who is crying.
Hurry up.

Come on.
Come on.
- Hurry up.

Hurry up.

Hurry up.

Go.
It's your fortune to serve our Old Master today as you are just the humble persons.
But it depends on your luck that whether you can survive or not.
Come on.

- Hurry up.

Get in, now.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Don't be frightened, Xing'er.
The prince asked me to send you the message.
The message?
How could you know that you can wait me here?
The prince said if I couldn't get into the Green Hills Court, then I could find the most secret trail to the outside, then I would find you.
Your prince just foretells like a prophet.
The prince is very smart.
What is the message?

During the 9 p.m to 11 p.m, the prince will wait for you at the west gate, he will not leave until he sees you.
I get it.
Xing'er.
Will you come?
Please tell your prince, if I don't show up on time today, you guys don't need to wait for me anymore.
Then I will report this to the prince.
What a personality.
That's why the prince likes her.
Sixth Sister.
Come here.
Listen to me.
I finally find a chance to leave the Green Hills Court.
What happened?
During the 9 p.m to 11 p.m, both of you go and wait for me at the west gate.
Be careful, don't be found out by somebody else.
What?
Sixth Sister.
Why didn't you come with us?
I...
I've got something very important to do.
What happened?
Sixth Sister.
Don't you plan to take the revenge?
If you really plan to take the revenge, just bring Xiaoqi with you,
Xiaoqi could help you a lot.
You could rest assured, as long as I am alive,
I will come to join you.
If...
If I can't show up on time, the guys of the Prince Yan Xun will pick up you, and you need to go back to Yanbei with them.
Then, you won't be the maids anymore, and you could just live your life.
Sixth Sister.
You must come back alive.
As the beautify I have,
I'm born to belong to the noble person.
Why is Sixth Sister so lucky?
Young Master likes her so much, but she still chooses to go with the Prince Yan Xun.
And I...
Young Master.
Xiaoba.
Seventh Sister.
What are you talking about alone?
Who is the Young Master?
I...

Who will take care of him when we all leave?
Yuwen Yue is our enemy.
Why do you think about him?
We will be free when we get Yanbei.
Zhixiang Sister is dead,
Linxi Brother is dead, too.
We and Sixth Sister need to rely upon each other for life.
Xiaoba.
Hurry up.
Keep up.

Hurry up.

Why are you crying?

Hurry up.
Come on.

Since you are here, just stop crying.

You should think about how to make the Old Mr. Xi happy, so not only you can survive, but also you may get the chance to become the noble person.
Just get inside, now.
All of you go inside, now.
Go inside quickly.
Why are you crying?

Don't be scared.
Where have you been?
Why did you take so long?
The Imperial concubine asked me to send the pastries to the West Palace.
What's matter, Your highness.
Why do you look like you are preoccupied by some troubles?
I don't know what happened either.
Today, my mother just came here suddenly, and said something every strange.
I'm worried there is some dangers to Yan Xun Brother.
The Prince Yan Xun?
What kind of danger will the Prince Yan Xun have?
You just go and figure out for me what happened during the Audience.
Yes.

Wait.
Be careful, and don't let my mother find it.
Don't worry.
Duke.
You can just wait for a moment, let me take two guys to get into the city and inquire about some informantion.
Xun'er is always cautious, and he won't ask me for help until it is very critical.
If the thing in the letter is true,
I will go and meet the emperor early tomorrow morning, and ask him what he is going to deal with me.
Duke, please don't do this.
Stop it.
We will take a rest here.
And we will get into the city early tomorrow morning.
Yes.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Keep up.
Go inside.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Go inside.
Go inside, now.
The following ones just hurry up.
Come on.
Why are you crying?

Come on.
Move.
Go.
Hurry up.
Come on.

Hurry up.
Come on.
Come on.
Keep up.
You just wash and freshen up without protest.
I will kill her if someone refuses to do it.
Just scatter around.
All of you scatter around, now.
It's time to shift.
Smelly girl, watch out.
I...

The blood incense can make people be confused.
It's lucky that I have the inner power.
(Sound of laughing)
Your highness.

A disaster is imminent.
What happened?
The emperor went out of the palace in plain clothes yesterday.
When he passed by the city moat, he saw someone salvage a big stone from the river.
And there are some words of treason and heresy on it.
What are they?
The emperor of the Wei State will die and Yan will rule the world.
Your highness, are your feet okay?
Then what?
what happened?
What did my father say?
The emperor summoned Wei Guang , Zhao Gui, and, and Yuwen Huai.
But I couldn't find out what they had talked about.
However, the emperor killed the General Song Zifu on the main hall.
Song Zifu came from Yanbei, and he was the General of Yanbei.
The power of the Wei State is on the north side.
They are the people who would most like the Duke Dingbei die.
It's been a long time since Zhao Donting of the Zhao State and his army escorted the Aunt Baisheng back to the Yanbei.
My father...
My father had a plan to kill them.
Your highness, what should we do?
Yan Xun Brother is in trouble.
That's why my mother, my mother said something like that to me and brother.
She must know there is nothing we can do.
I...
I have to inform Yan Xun Brother.
Your highness.
I have to save Yan Xun Brother.
I have to tell him to run away.
I will run away with him
Your highness.
The slim chance of survival is to escape.
Your highness.
- Please calm down.

Yan Xun Brother is in trouble.
If you can't help him, don't stand in my way.
Change my clothes.
Yes.
Young Master.
Do you confirm who they are?
Young Master.

It's true.
Let go.
(Sound of fighting)
Kill them all.
Kill them all.
Kill them all.
Kill them all.
Kill them all.
I have mustered thirty Yanbei elite soldiers to escort prince to leave Chang'an by night.
Thanks for the trouble.
Before 9 o'clock,
I will take Xing'er and her two sisters at the west city gate.
Prince, will Xing'er come?
Feel safe.

Prince.
Say no more.
I must take them back to Yanbei safe and sound.
Stop!
Who is it?
I'm sorry!
I didn't recognize Your Highness.
I want to go out.
Move.
The gate has been locked.
What is Your Highness going to do outside?
I want to go out.
Do I need to report to you?
I dare not.
Then move.
But... opening the gate without a summon will get me killed.
If you don't open the gate,
I'll kill you now.
Stop.
Imperial Concubine.
Mother.
Where are you going?
I'm bored in palaces, so I want to take a walk outside.
Nonsense.
Mother, you knew it, right?
You knew that Brother Yan Xun was in trouble.
So you said those things to me and my brother.
Is that right?
Right.
Then why didn't you tell me?
You know it now.
What do you want to do?
I'm going to tell Brother Yan Xun.
Then?
Then I'll let him escape.
I'll go away with him.
Your father have given orders that troops go to Yanbei to kill the Duke Dingbei family.
You go to find him.

I don't care about death.
If I should die,
I will die with
Brother Yan Xun.
Princess.
You are the princess of the Wei State.
You have your position.
If it takes a favourable turn, you can make efforts for him.
But if the outcome is a foregone conclusion, you should understand that which side should you be at.
I have told you about the situation in Yanbei.
But you never marked my words.
Are you an airhead?
But if I don't go and tell Brother Yan Xun now.
He will really die, mother.
You can't change anything.
Why?
Why should it be the ending?
I don't want this kind of ending.
Mother, I beg you.
Please let me out.
Let me save Brother Yan Xun.
Really.
I assure you.
I will behave afterwards.
I will listen to everything that you say.
Really.
Brother Yan Xun is the only one that I like.
I don't want him to die.
I won't let him die, mother.
Please save him.
You will have to face it sooner or later.
Better a finger off than always aching.
You'll be fine after going through this matter.
Escort pricess back to palaces.
Mother.
- Mother.

Mother.
Please save Brother Yan Xun.
Princess.
He will really die, mother.
Princess.
Princess.
Princess.
- Let me go.

Let me go.

- I want to go out.

(Sound of laughing)
Bastard.
Bold slave.
Do you know...
Do you know who I am?
Guards.
Guards.
(Sound of people falling into the water)
Kill her.
From now on, we can look after each other and never be apart.
It is what you owe my Sister Zhixiang.
Watch you eat makes me happier than eating it myself.
This bouilli is the most tasting food
I have even eaten in my life.
It is what you owe my Brother Linxi and all the innocent girls that you harmed and killed.
Yuwen Xi.
Go to hell.
If you are not dying naturally anytime soon,
I will end your life.
(Crying)
Don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.
I am Xing'er from the Green Hills Court.
Yuwen Xi, this old baster, was inhuman and harmed many young innocent girls.
Young Master Yue sent me to kill him.
No mastter what the people at the Red Hills Court do to you, you can't reveal a word of it.
Young Master Yue will rescue you.
Got it?
Yes.

Grand Master.
Grand Master.
Grand Master.
(Crying)
What happened?
Young Master Yue sent Xing'er to kill His Grand Master.
Young Master Yue.
Every single of you are the most competent men from Yanbei.
Tonight,
I need to rely on your help to leave Chang'an from Yanbei.
This journey can be dangerous.
Everyone needs to watch out for your own life.
When we arrive at Yanbei, we shall celebrate this victory.
We shall do our best to protect Your Highness.
No matter what happens.
Bring out the wine.
To all of you.
To Your Highness.
(Sound of bowls breaking)
Prince, it is time.
Wait.
Prince,
I gathered some information in the city.
I have something important to tell you.
Tell me.
Yuwen Xi at the Red Hills Court was assassinated.
The killer is a maid, named Xing'er.
Prince, please don't.
Miss Yu, you and the others leave now according to the plan.
Before 9 p.m.
I shall go to the west gate to meet with you.
Prince, we don't have much time.
Stop it.
It is way too important.
I must save Xing'er.
(Signs)
