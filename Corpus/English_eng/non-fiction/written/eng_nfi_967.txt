Hey, man.
- What?

So, there's an older couple who rents the cabin, and there's a guy next door who has a kid.
Plus, there's a stripper who tapes dudes and blackmails them with the help of her stepson.
Although last episode, that dude got locked in his own trunk.
- Anyway, you should check it out.

I didn't really like the last show you recommended.
The Grammys?
- Yeah.

Do I have you to thank for this bounty?
I didn't want you to get hungry.
It's gonna be a long one.
JILL:

- town with his fiancée.

And as I've told you before, as long as his fiancée refuses to enter the house of the Lord, she's not welcome in mine, either.
So, Jeff and I rented a cabin in the mountains.
- Did you find a good church yet?

Just because Lynn's an atheist doesn't mean you can't spend a little time away from each other on a Sunday morning.
You're gonna be separated in the afterlife.
- Might as well practice.

- How's work, Mom?

Work is work.
Somebody brought in a constipated ferret last week.
Have you ever seen a ferret in real life?
Looks like an eel wearing a toupée.
I don't even think it's legal to have them as pets.
I wanted to call the police.
But Dr. Griffin disagreed.
So I just did my job and lubed up his little pinky so he could shove it up that dirty little varmint's impacted anus.

- Sorry.

Now, you show me another stepmom that would do that for her adopted black son, and don't you say Sandra Bullock, 'cause I know your slow ass ain't protecting nobody's blind side.

Okay.

So, what exactly was in this syringe you stuck into your son's fiancée's leg?
Propofol.
As a veterinary nurse, I have access to some very powerful sedatives.
The trick is figuring out how much to use, so I just tripled the dose we gave a cocker spaniel who had a hysterectomy.
Can you believe that's what she sleeps in?
Talk about skimpy.

Don't actually look, Jeff.

Oh, sorry, I-I couldn't tell from your inflection.

Jeff and I had already prepared the hot tub area for Lynn's baptism.
♪
We had lit some candles we had brought from the church... ... and I changed Lynn into a more tasteful outfit as Jeff averted his eyes.
The whole ceremony only takes about 10 minutes.
Jeff dunked her under water about four times, holding her nose to make sure she didn't drown.
I dried her off the best I could and put her back into her nightgown...
If you can call it that.
[DOOR CREAKS, CLOSES]
Some lunatic wrote a filthy story in the guest book about women and feet.
I can't imagine how crowded Hell must be these days.
- Good morning.

- How'd you sleep?

Must be the mountain air.

Lynn can blame it on the mountain air all she wants, but I knew why she felt the way she did.
It was the first time she woke up with the Lord in her soul.
And because of that, we all started to get along.
But I'm not saying definitively that there is no God.
I mean, how could I?

So, there's an argument to be made that without tangible proof that there is no God,
I can't logically rule it out.
I was feeling so good about the change that was happening in Lynn that I got brave enough to take a little gamble.
Lynn, listen.
I know you have your beliefs, and I totally respect that.
But I bought something for you before I knew about the whole atheist thing, and I've been holding onto it, which is really silly because it's just a beautiful piece of jewelry.
Oh, my.

Well, that's one way of looking at it.
Or, it's just a pretty necklace with a very fit, long-haired hippie on a cross.
It doesn't matter who you think it is.

Thank you.

You're welcome.
Did you sleep with the window open?
Yeah, but the screen was shut.
Hey, have you guys gotten bitten by any bugs while we're here?
Lynn woke up with something weird on her leg.
- [GASPS] Oh, my.

It's bad, right?

- Well, I don't know.

It's, um, just a bug bite.
Last time we were up here, I had something very similar.
It'll go away.

It'll... go away.
Dear Lord, as I have told you repeatedly throughout the day, we have a problem.
Lynn's leg is still red and inflamed around the injection site.
Will you stop reading and get down on your knees?
I already prayed when you were in the bathroom shaving your calluses.
- Did you pray about Lynn's leg?

I chatted with him a little bit about my brother's problem, but no, most of it was about the leg.
Your brother is a drunk who was fired from Krispy Kreme.
I can't have the Lord preoccupied with that right now.

I just started a chapter.
Get on your knees.
[SIGHS]
[GRUNTS]
[SIGHS]
I'm sorry about that, Lord.

- I'm here now, too.

Lord,
I know you work in mysterious ways, but I need you to make that mark go away.
Things have been better than ever since Lynn's baptism, so I don't know why you put that mark there.
In any event, I need it to disappear pronto.
And for that, I pray.
- What are you doing?

You haven't prayed again yet.
Well, I thought as long as I was next to you,
- it was like I was...

[SIGHS]
Lord, it's me again...

How 'bout we put a pin in all that stuff about what my brother may or may not have done to those jelly doughnuts?
Instead, I'd like to draw your attention to the matter my wife was discussing.

Well, you're the one who wanted to separate.
If you can't live on the money we agreed on, then maybe you should think about getting a job.
Oh, that's funny to you.
It looks like she has a MRSA staph infection.
Oh, that's not good.
We had a hamster that had one of those,
- and we had to burn him.

You gonna put my son on so I can sing him a "Happy Birthday" before he goes to school or not?
No, I'm not saying he shouldn't brush his teeth.
Jesus, Jessica, does everything have to be a fight?
- How could this happen?

- for an infection to get in.

Oh, the MRSA virus is everywhere.
You can pick it up from a hotel doorknob, a public restroom, even a hot tub if it's not cleaned properly.
- Oh, dear Lord.

We're gonna do everything we can to save her leg.

We'll be admitting her upstairs soon.

I just don't get it, man.

I baptized an atheist for you.
That's like dragging Osama bin Laden into the White House and making him sing the national anthem while eating a hot dog!
Why are you punishing me?
I told you this was a bad idea.
We should've stayed home and baptized her in our own bathtub.
God knows who's been soaking their infected body in that hot tub.
That's right.
You knew exactly who had been in that hut tub.
How the heck did you allow this to happen?
[ETHAN CLEARS THROAT]
How long have you been standing there?
Pretty long.
Ethan was less than pleased.
How could you do this?

I did it for you.
Trust me, you do not want to be married to an atheist.
You think God's gonna pay attention to you and your little half-atheist babies?
And it was working, too.
You saw how nice Lynn was being after we baptized her.
She admitted there might be a God.
She even put on the crucifix I gave her.
Because I bribed her!

I made a deal with her.
- What deal?

It does matter.

- is worth to you.

I told her that I would go down on her four times for every time she goes down on me.
Oh, man.

Why are you telling us this?
You told me to!
Well, that's before I knew what it was.
You knew what it was.

You knew what it was.

Look, Ethan, when you tell Lynn about this...
I'm not telling Lynn about this!
- You're not?

I'm a chubby grocery store manager who sleeps with a loud-ass machine that keeps me alive at night.
An atheist with one leg who blows me 25% of the time that I go down on her is as good as I'm gonna do, and I'm not risking losing her over this.
Ah.
♪
If she loses that leg, you might be able to renegotiate that deal.
The next few days were torture.
We didn't know if Lynn was gonna live.
But eventually, we got some good news.
The antibiotics worked.
- [CHUCKLING] Oh!

She has to see her doctor when she gets home,
- but she's gonna be fine.

- You gave us quite a scare, honey.

Come on, Dad.

- pull the car around.

- Is that a new turtleneck?

I'm so glad you're gonna be okay.
- Me, too.

To tell you the truth, I kind of have you
- to thank for it.

When you gave me this necklace,
I have to admit I accepted it just to be polite.
But after I'd been in here a couple of days,
I started to get scared.
You know?

And being an atheist, I had nowhere to turn, so I just took a shot.
I prayed.
And I felt better.
I felt like...
Like I wasn't alone.
And then the next thing I knew, the medicine started working.
I've always been a non-believer because
I've never seen proof that God existed, but I can't claim that anymore.
I welcomed him into my life, and I think he healed me.
Who knows.

What do they say... "The Lord works in mysterious ways"?
Yeah.
That's what they say.
Wow.
My head wants to condemn your actions, but my heart is full of God's adoration.
You brought a new member into his flock.
Yeah, I sure did.
And that makes us even 'cause I'm leaving.
Excuse me?
I didn't come here to confess, Father.
- I came to resign.

That son of a bitch up there has put me through the goddamn ringer.
Did He take the mark off her leg when I asked him to?
No, He made it bigger.
But when she asked him to heal her, a goddamn atheist, and suddenly, he's all ears.
What, is he into younger girls?
- Is that what this is all about?

I have been to church every Sunday of my life because I thought it would lead to a better life.
And guess what?

Driving around in my mother's old station wagon because I give 10% of everything I make to the church.
And don't even get me started on the lousy body your buddy God gave me to parade around in.
- You're a beautiful woman.

Jeff won't even go near them.
They look like the tail end of a balloon animal.
Ah, but you should see the nipples that he put on the atheist.
- Jill, if you would just...

I gave 63 years of my life to that dude, and this is how he treats me?
I don't have time for this bullshit.
I'm out.
