- I'm offering you a fight.

I wanna do a legends fight.
It's a million fuckin' dollars.
Why was it so important to fight Matt Hughes?
Unfinished business.
According to the MRI, you have a lot of scar tissue...
Call Garo.

Not only are you a real fighter, you're gonna be a great fucking fighter.
I'm glad you're here with me.
I'm gay.
You're gonna tell me you're a fucking faggot?
Nate?

What the fuck...

Chill!
Nate!

- Nate!

Let me get some coins, please.
Two?
Hey.
Where are you?
I'm not there anymore.
You left?
I left.
I'm sorry.
Where are you?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Alvey.
Yeah.

Lisa...
Lisa, I don't want to talk to anybody now.
They saw the fight, you know.
Just tell them I'm in the hospital.
Alvey, tell me where you are, and I'll come to you.
He knew that I loved him.
I know he did.

He knew.
That's what's gonna happen.
I think it's gonna go the full five rounds.
Boy.

I mean, come on.

It's gonna be incredible.
I agree with you.
And, also, Alvey, he's gonna have to deal with the loss of his 25yearold s...
Coach.
Am I late?

Couldn't sleep.
How's your weight?
Nine over.
Nothing but a fat girl's baby.
Which, which scale you use?
The old one.
Let's use the digital one.

Take a shit?
Take a break, man.
Let's go fuck up that dragon.
Do you want the hanging ones in the bag, too?
Just lay this, um, over the truck, in the back.
Just lay 'em down.
I think it's good.
My mom, she kept all my brother's stuff after he died.
She even slept in his bed, so that really fucked her up.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thanks.
Travis.
- He wrecked his fourwheeler.

Go put those in the truck.
I didn't know he had so much stuff.
I bought some flowers.
I thought we could walk to the beach.
That's good.
Okay, well...
Whenever you're ready, we can go.
Yeah, this is the last of it.
I'll just meet you out there.
Do 30 minutes, 5minute rest, 2 more 10minute rounds, and then we'll check your weight?
You use Albolene or the mineral oil?
Albolene.
You should try the mineral oil.

It's, like, it's less greasy and it actually opens up your pores better...
Ryan...
I don't give a fuck.
I want you to corner me.

I'd be honored.
What about Jay?
What about him?
You don't want him in there?
I need one voice.
Have you talked to him lately?
Not since the funeral.
Maybe you should call him.
I have.
He'll come around.
He will or he won't.
I have a fight tomorrow.

Yes, Coach.
You don't need to be here.
All right.

Thank you for your help.

The bags.
Hey.
Hey.
What's that?
It's, from Nate's last fight.
Whoa.
That's a great fucking shot.
Have you talked to Jay?
Just text.

No.

I think he's been with his mom.
I wanna honor Nate at the fight tomorrow night.
Do you know if he's coming?
He hasn't said anything, but I can ask him.
- No, it's fine.

- Okay?

How are you doing?
Fucking terrible.
I feel sick.
You?
I fucking miss him.
You should go check on Alvey.
We have to call your mother.
Maybe you go back and be with her, and I'll...
I'll handle his body.
What are you doing?

Come on.

Jay.
What did you say to him?
I don't know what I said.
He was sitting... he was sitting...
He was sitting right there.
My God.
Hey.

You're all right.

Take a breath.

Breathe, you breathing?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

Hey, just relax.

I got you.

Hey.

Hey, listen, this is what you do.
This is nothing for you.

- You get paid for pain, right?

- We're gonna get you there.

- Let's fucking do this.

- You're a fucking warrior.

Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf
- of King Beast Promotions...

- All right.

Both of these men are living legends, and tomorrow, they will battle for the King Beast Welterweight Superfight Belt.

Alvey "King" Kulina!

All right, we step over here with Alvey Kulina.
Alvey, you know, you're beloved by so many fans.
How does it feel to be back?
And, what's going through your head right now?
It feels great, Kenny.

Um, I'm just hoping that Matt and I put on a good show.
I saw that you two exchanged some words.

You know, Matt Hughes is always a class act.
He just, gave mme his condolences for my son.
Well, our...

I knew Nate.

- We all miss him.

Alvey Kulina, folks!
All right...
Hey, Jay, it's me.
You can come in.
Hey.
How you feeling?
You get out of the house today?
- I did.

You should come down to the gym, man, move around a little bit.
I'll take it easy on you.
How's your hand doing?
Better.
Fucking smells like ass, dude.
I was in the sauna with your dad, helping him with the cut.
Fuck.
Did he make weight?
Yeah, he did.

We had to hook him up to the I.V.
And Hughes looked big as fuck.
Yeah.

Yeah.
He'll fight 190, easy.
Alvey's gonna have his hands full.
Lisa says she's been calling you, man.
She has, yeah.

She's doing something for Nate at the fight, and she wants to know if you want to be a part of it.
Like a...
Like a...
Like an in memoriam video thing?
Yeah.
It's nice.

You have a... you have a mellifluous voice, Ryan.
10 years of choir.
- Yeah?

- Soloist, I...

- Bet.

Huge fucking nuts, just...
I'm not gonna do anything to hurt myself, so you don't have to worry about that.
- No, I know you're not.

He's giving me just... normal shit.
Yeah, man, I'm just stopping by on my way home, dude.
All right, I'll leave you be.
You should call your dad, dude.
He said you guys haven't talked since...
It's just been a week.
Yeah.

I didn't call my mom for a week either after my dad died, and then a month and then a year.
Now I don't even know where the fuck she lives, dude.
The longer you wait, the harder it gets, so...
Love you, bro.
Thanks.
We donated his clothes today.
Jay and I took them to the LGBT center, and then we went... and put some flowers in the ocean.
Yeah, good.

That's nice.

How are you gonna do this, Alvey?
Do what?
Fight.
What do you mean, Christina?

What else... what else can I do?

I don't know.
I was...
I was looking in his eyes...
I was looking in his eyes when he died.
He was... he was so fucking scared.
He was like a little boy.

I swear to Christ, he looked like he was...
He was 6 years old again.

He looked like aa child.
He looked like a baby.
Fuck.
I couldn't fucking help him.
My son.
I couldn't fucking help him.
Fuck.
One more minute, all right?
Slow it down.

Yep.

Come on.

All right.

Come on, man.

Yeah, there you go.

Touch 'em up.
That's all you got?
Hey, guys.

20%, guys.

Guys, guys.

Hey, Juan, slow...
Come on, guys.

Hey, hey.

The fucking fight is tonight, motherfuckers.
You wanna lose that fucking million dollars, you shithead?
You fucking eat yet, by the way?
Hey.

I'll make you some fucking oatmeal.
What do you tell me?

"Relax.

Hey.
We're looking for you.

There's no need to worry.
Why don't you come back to the house?
Ryan and... and Lisa are still there.
We should be around family.
You know, we'll have some dinner.
I'm not sitting around a fucking table.
And we're not gonna get through this together as a family because that's not what the fuck we are.
He's the only one who gave a shit.
I wouldn't even be talking to you without him.
I wouldn't even be alive.
I fucking used him to stay alive.
And he asked you for one thing.
For one moment, he wanted you to know who he was.
He wanted you to fucking pull him in and say, "Relax, son."
I got you, son."
I wanted to.
I didn't know what he was saying to me.

II just needed...
I just needed a fucking minute.

You had his whole fucking life in your hands.
You know what?
I'm no fucking better, and neither is Mom.
So we can just live with that, together.
Hey.
We're about to start.

No, I'm gonna stay here.
Okay.
Beat him up.
Hey.
Hi.
And your ringside physician, Dr. Kessler.
With the three judges scoring...
You look beautiful.
- So do you.

When the action begins inside of the cage, your referee in charge, Mike Beltran.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the cage the new President of King Beast Promotions,
Lisa Prince.
Thank you.
Um, on behalf of King Beast,
I just wanna welcome everyone to the Legends Fight...
Kulina vs. Hughes.
- Any questions, guys?

- Nope.

Um... as many of you know, the fighting world lost someone very dear to us...
Nate Kulina.
I was blessed enough to be close to Nate.
I got to hug him every day that he walked into Navy Street.
And when I was at my lowest, his smile saved my life.
I would give anything to see that smile just one more time.
Nate's whole world was his older brother, so I would like to welcome him to the stage to say a few words...

Thank you.
My brother Nate and me were raised by wolves.
I became one, but my brother did not.
And that worried me, because I was his older brother and I had to take care of him.
I had to protect him.
I had to teach him.

So I would say to him that the only way to get through life is to be violent and unyielding, and I would tell him that with a lacerated face and broken hands just to prove it.
Here we go.
And he would nod, and he would sew me up and wrap my hands.
And when I would rant about how life will fuck you and tear you down... and steal from you... he would nod and he would wipe away my tears.
And when he would find me on the floor with my body shot full of dope, because sometimes
I don't believe a fucking word I'm saying, he would not call me a fraud.
He would pick me up and he'd put me into bed and he would say,
"Jay..."
"I got you.

Nate was kind, he was courageous, he was brave, he was loyal, he was unrelenting.
And he was an absolute savage in this cage.
My brother was also gay, which I think a lot of you knew.
So if you have a fucking problem with that,
I think you should stand up right now and speak.
Wow.

A lot of chicken shit motherfuckers in here.
Fuck you.
You are not allowed to whisper anymore.
For all of you who talked shit, who made my brother's walls around him rise up, fuck you.
Stand up.
Step into this fucking light... and then sit the fuck down because he still would whoop your ass.
All right, let's do this.
Moment of silence, please.
Thank you.
He cannot fucking stand with you.

You're ready.

Welcome to the cage the former 9time.
UFC Welterweight Champion of the World.
From Hillsboro, Illinois...
Matt Hughes!
- The King is back, baby!

King is back!
Here we go.
It's game time, baby.

- You flip that fucking switch.

- Yeah.

You stick and you move.

Are you ready?
Let's go!

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the cage, from Venice, California...
Alvey "The King" Kulina!
All right, so we've been over the rules already.
Respect yourself at all times, obey my commands at all times.
Touch gloves now if you want.
At the sound of the bell, come on out,
Let's go.
You bring it to him!

Shake it off!

Head down, Kulina!

10 seconds!
Get out of the fence.

Fucking beautiful.

Hey, hey.

Beautiful, Alvey.
You gotta be a little bit more aggressive.
The only time he's getting his hands on you is when you're planting and loading up.
He's running out of gas already.
Establish a jab, add more combos to it.
Hey, Alvey, you're backing this motherfucker up.
Keep moving!
Control the distance.

Protect yourself.

Show me you're there.
Protect yourself.
10 seconds!
Hey!

Hey.

Get up, Alvey!
Protect yourself, Alvey.

Protect yourself!

Shake it!

Hook the bottom leg!

10 seconds!
Fuck!
Come on!

Come on, move, move, move.
Come on, Alvey!
Don't stay down!
Alvey, get up!

Right here, buddy.

Right here.

Good.

Alvey, can you see?

- He's good.

- He's good.

You got five minutes to go.

Listen to me, I need five minutes of hell over there.
Whoever wins this, wins the fight.
You win this round, you win the fight.
You gotta stay active, okay?

I need five minutes of hell.
I need five minutes of hell from you.

I need five fucking minutes of hell!

Let's go!

All right, gentlemen, bring it in, bring it in.
All right, gentlemen, fifth and final round.
You guys, touch gloves now.
All right, good luck, guys.

Five fucking minutes!

This is your round, Coach!

All right, gentlemen, fifth and final round!
You ready to fight?

Okay, let's go!
Come on!

Keep your feet moving!
Get out of there!
Don't stand in front...
Stay moving!

Get him!

Yes!

Let's go!

Protect yourself!
Stop!

Scores it 4847 for Hughes.
Turn to Mike Bell... 4847, Kulina.
And judge Derek Cleary... winner by split decision...
Alvey "King" Kulina!
I'm here with the legend Alvey Kulina.

First off, tell me your thoughts on being back in the cage.
What did you think about it?
Well, I just... you know, first of all,
I just wanna say thank you to the great Matt Hughes.
Truly a legend.

Thank you, everybody, for coming down here.
This fight is for my son, Nate.
I love you.

Alvey Kulina is your King Beast Welterweight Superfight champion!
