Stop the bus!
You can't jump off a...
Stop!
Give me my bag!
Are you all right?
Madam, I need my inhaler.
Are you all right?
No, no, I don't need the fuss.
There was only a couple of quid in me purse.
Madam, I need to report this.
Madam?
Strangled?
I haven't moved her yet, but there's a cord round her neck.
Drag marks on the concrete.
Scuffing on the back of her boots.
I'm guessing not many people come down here.
From a phone box on the estate.
Get these people out of here!
Where's Clay?
Twice in three days.
You in love?
You got a message?
I'm reconsidering our arrangement.
Tell him I'm looking for him.
You're supposed to be making up for last week's traffic screw-up so,
I have something positive to write in your first probationary report.
Golf Hotel, 5-2.
Can you attend, over?
Horrible business.
I've not been around a murder case before.
One of you, two teas and biscuits to DI Bradfield's office.
Golf Hotel to 5-9.
Maybe clean yourself up while you're at it.
Yeah, reports of suspicious activity.
Morning, Jane.
Ta, love.
I want Uniforms knocking on doors.
Someone knows who she is.
Right.
'Bout bloody time!
Four quid still in her pocket, so I'm ruling out robbery.
The note's been sent to the lab for prints.
How was she killed?
WPC Tennison, you're testing my patience today.
With her own bra.
Has she done any foot patrol there before?
She's sure she'll be able to handle it, Sir.
Five minutes, front of station.
Right, D section lads, you're on the Kingsmead here.
Blake, Doyle, Morgan, Tennison, I want you on the Pembridge over there.
Let's get knocking on doors!
Come on, go!
No.
Thanks very much.
Sorry to bother you, Ma...
Have you seen this woman before?
Maybe your mother?
No.
No.
Said she used to hang out at the Greyhound pub.
Staff reckon from the description she was an out-patient.
All right, get in.
Do yourself a damage.
Look, you're all right.
We're not here to bash heads.
Do you know this girl?
Looks like Julie.
When did you last see her?
Not for a couple of weeks.
How about any bother?
Any creeps giving her a hard time?
What about a pimp?
I don't know.
She used to hang out with this fella.
Told me she was sweet on him.
Can you give me a name and description, Madam?
Think that's why she felt sorry for him.
Thanks, girls.
Take care of yourselves, yeah?
This is her last known address.
Times were tough.
Hold up, how can you not know about Watergate?
President Nixon.
It's none of my business, is it?
Looks like half the junkies on the estate have used this place.
Come on.
Clear the hair.
Looks like you've had a bit more than whisky in your jar, son.
Give us your left hand!
Look, pens, yeah?
You... sign your name.
Let's go.
You make a little mark there.
Well done.
You stink, the pair of you!
Concentrate, Eddie!
What were you saying?
You were high?
When I turned my ankle.
I'm her boyfriend.
We went to see Oz on the hill.
Who's Oz?
Julie, is she going to be OK?
How do you feel about your girlfriend shagging other people for money?
I hate it.
Yeah, you're a real saint.
What have you been up to the last 24 hours?
The one that ran away.
Who?
When we picked you up, there was three of you.
May 1st, Eddie takes Julie-Ann to the hospital.
Morgan, this Suzy, she claims Eddie and Julie-Ann were lovebirds?
Prints from the phone kiosk on the Kingsmead, they don't match Eddie Phillips or Billy Myers.
But we have missing persons reports for Julie-Ann Collins.
Latest was last year, July, reported by George Collins.
We're checking, Sir.
I need a uniform presence for a next of kin visit.
I haven't done one of those yet.
Can you find me another plonk, then?
No, I didn't mean...
I'll do it.
We're out of traffic now.
Once we're inside, if the mother cries, do I comfort her?
How would I do that?
Sorry if I'm asking too many questions.
Just do what feels natural.
Grab that envelope from the back seat.
You want me to show this to the family?
So what part of London are you from?
Maida Vale, Sir.
And what brings a Maida Vale girl to the police?
I thought the force could do with more posh sorts, Sir.
Fair enough.
You shouldn't apologise for asking questions.
It's the only way you're going to become a better copper.
Mr George Collins?
Would you mind if we come in, Sir?
Of course.
Do you have a daughter named Julie-Ann?
Is she in trouble again?
I'm very sorry to tell you that... a girl we believe to be your daughter has been found dead.
What?
The body of a young female was found earlier today on the Kingsmead estate in Hackney.
We are treating it as a murder enquiry.
We need someone to formally identify her as soon as possible.
So you can't be sure that it is her.
Not until she's formally identified, Sir, no.
What's this about?
I've got an alternative proposal.
It may take a few weeks to put in place.
But there's a bookie's on the King's Road I'm looking into.
No, we're doing the bank.
One of my boys bumped into your wife.
She put up quite a fight.
You bother me again... next time, I'll send two in.
When did you last see her?
Not for a while.
Over a year ago.
I tried to help.
Just... hoped she'd come back.
Like other parents' kids do.
Mr. Collins?
Yes, it's her.
That's Julie-Ann.
She rejected us.
'Names which turned out were taken from the spy novels written by their boss.
Hi, Mum.
Have you been at work all this time?
Yes.
Hi.
A girl was murdered.
I went on the bereavement visit, and the DI sent me on the house-to-house.
On your own?
Should have called.
Mum, can you knock?
Haven't even looked at your bridesmaid's dress.
I found these in your dressing gown pocket.
I didn't know you were on the Pill.
Mum, it's 1973.
It's not a big deal.
Your sister's not on the Pill.
Jane...
You come home late and you're moody.
And you're effing and jeffing!
I'll try to curb the effing and jeffing.
So would I be if all I had to care about was shampoo and clippers.
And a wedding.
How can that make you happy?
Because it matters.
When we find the person that killed that girl, it will matter.
We!
Morning, Kath!
Remember the old folk's house in Bishop's Fields that kept getting burgled?
Yeah, Gordon Bennett.
Am I?
If you need some tips, maybe we could grab a drink later.
All right.
We need the floor plans for the bank.
Look like you've just seen a ghost.
What are you depressing yourself with that crap for?
She was pretty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Know what you got to do?
Yeah.
Just forget about her now, all right?
I'll drop you off, then meet you back home.
Stick to looking at page three.
All right, you can go in now.
How's my boy?
Look at the state of you.
Eyes all bloodshot.
You smoking that crap again?
Mum got mugged.
Is she OK?
Man who done it said it was a message from Clay Whiteley.
We're all in danger now.
It was a misunderstanding.
Your old man sorted it.
John wants the plans.
I'll tell him tomorrow.
Which makes it the only thing we found in your flat which is definitely yours.
Now you're sober, you can tell us more.
You took her to the drugs unit in Homerton hospital.
Last time I saw her, she wanted to get onto the methadone.
But then something happened and she panicked.
What happened?
Did you see her get into a car?
Yeah.
A red one.
Well, we'll keep our eyes peeled for a red car!
What sort of red car, Eddie?
A red Jag, but you don't know the driver.
Night before last, you kipped over at your nan's.
Nancy Phillips.
Worth us asking her about Julie-Ann?
Did you kill her?
Who would want Julie-Ann dead, Eddie?
Think.
Who?
Shit, he's gonna puke!
Not on my shoes, you little shite!
Call an ambulance!
I knew something weren't quite right.
See this bit of net curtain hanging out the bottom of the window.
I'm out the back...
While you were doing all that, I was tackling the suspect to the ground!
Right, Eddie Phillips has given us a lead.
He spotted a red Jaguar pick up Julie-Ann from Homerton hospital on May the 1st.
I want it found pronto.
Sorry.
Looks like I'm on vomit duty, then!
Nothing like being thrown in the deep end.
Morning, Paul.
Hello, there.
We didn't find anything else at the scene.
Just the money that was in her pocket.
And a cheap beaded bracelet on her right wrist.
These are her white socks, and boots.
We did find some red carpet fibre on the soles of her socks.
And also some on the inside of her boots.
DS Lawrence, I presume you're doing exhibits and photographs.
For the paperwork, you are?
Probationary WPC 517G Tennison, attached to B Relief, Hackney, Sir.
Just name and number will suffice.
This gruff sod's Professor Dean Martin.
Spare me the Rat Pack jokes.
Right, gather round.
Try not to drop fag ash on my instruments tray, DI Bradfield.
From the hypostasis and rigor examined on the body at the scene,
I'd estimate she was killed between 6PM and midnight on Sunday the 13th of May.
Cause of death, strangulation?
The knot on the bra was tied so tight, I had to cut it.
If you need to vomit, the toilets are that way.
The bra is strapless, so it might not have been removed forcibly.
Maybe she took it off beneath her top.
Fair point.
Extensive blue and yellow bruising down the length of the right arm.
Caused by severe blunt-force trauma.
Can we turn the body over, please?
Little lady took an extensive beating to the buttocks and the back.
At the time of death?
No, it's older.
See the difference between the bruising here... and the more recent marks on the neck?
I'd estimate ten days old.
The amount of overlapping injuries suggest whoever inflicted them was in a rage.
WPC Tennison... would you mind crouching down?
Side on, foetal position, facing me.
Raise your right hand.
Palm upwards, as if you were trying to protect your head.
Perfect.
She was struck repeatedly on the lower arm.
And then beaten repeatedly on the buttocks and the back.
She fell and lay prostrate on the floor.
He didn't mean for you to actually do that bit, Tennison.
Right, let's proceed to the fainting part.
Gentlemen, roll her back over, please.
Let's start the internal examination.
This may be another reason your victim wanted to get off the drugs.
A dead foetus in the uterus.
From the size and development, it's very early stages.
I'd estimate six to eight weeks.
Davey, what have I said about smoking that stuff in here?
It's raining and the damp makes my legs worse.
Then why were you out in it the night before last?
I was here all night, Ma.
Whoever she is, she's not worth the bother.
Leave it, Ma.
I need you to write up a PM report on what the professor told us.
Yes, Sir.
Now who is in charge here?
Oi!
You've put my grandson in hospital.
He ain't got nothing to do with that tart's murder.
Couple of months back, he borrowed money for her.
What you gonna do about that?
He didn't tell us any of that.
The night before last, was Eddie at yours the whole time?
If he lied about that, what else did he lie about?
We've got to bring him back in.
Eddie Phillips has absconded.
I want all units out there looking for him now.
Bugger.
Before you go home, pin these to the incident board.
Why do you smell of Dettol?
I was at the mort...
Mortuary.
Eddie Phillips!
Nothing down here.
He said, "Not in those trousers!"
Hello, Suzy.
Love now, is it?
We're looking for Julie-Ann's boyfriend.
What was Julie-Ann's relationship with Eddie like?
I didn't know him.
Piss off, love.
Sorry I bothered you.
It makes me sick to my stomach that that bastard is out there somewhere breathing, eating, living, while Julie-Ann is in the mortuary being prodded and poked and sliced open.
Help me help her.
Makes me sick too.
Not from round here, are you?
No.
She didn't belong here neither.
She wanted out.
That bastard Eddie had her trapped.
I don't want to say no more.
Eddie!
Mr Collins.
I think we need to talk.
How do you know about Eddie?
The newspaper describes him as Julie-Ann's boyfriend.
There's blood here and here.
I don't know what's going on in that head of yours.
But don't fuck this one up for us, David.
Next time, I'll take more than just your wife's purse.
I admire you.
Be careful, Jane.
Nothing happened.
Why do you keep using my first name?
You think I'm guilty?
