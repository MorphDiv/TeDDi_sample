Frankie:

In L.A., they have galas.
But at East Indiana State, you haven't lived till you've been to the annual
Axl, Hutch, and Kenny 'Bago Bash... beverages and food not included.
[Chuckles] All right!
We did it, man.
Senior year...

- Whoa!

Pita chips and no hummus.
The flier specified
"All chips to be accompanied by their respective dips."
Well, let's send it through the skylight and see what the people have to say.
[Cheering]
You got lucky.

[Laughs] All right.

Come on in.
Wow.

She's been good to us.
Yes, she has.
Wait.

I mean, I can't take it with me, 'cause I'm gonna be in grad school.
Well, I can't take it.
I got a business degree from East Indiana State.
I'm gonna be, like...

Carrying a briefcase down hallways, asking people about their weekends.
Okay.
What if we give it to a needy freshman, let the legend continue?
Or... we could sell it to a needy freshman and let the legend continue.
Oh, you are a business man.
Mm-hmm.
[Laughs] Whoo-hoo!

Oh, hey!

No, it is not.
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
You can't be the beret kid.
I don't care how many bullying seminars they have.
A beret is just a big, fat target on your back.
It isn't a beret.

Yeah, well, be prepared to fish your tam out of the toilet.
Anyway, you've heard of the musical "Hamilton"?
No.

Well, the school is voting on what the spring play should be this year, and I was thinking, with the recent popularity of "Hamilton,"
that I would write and submit my own.
Because if we're celebrating unsung heroes,
I believe there's someone we're all forgetting.
Sergeant Charles Stuart MacKenzie!
It's got everything...
World War I, bagpipes, Scottish rap.
I can't leave work today to pick him up
- when the nurse calls.

Dr. Goodwin's getting me to take me to some seminar.
Well, hopefully it'll happen on the bus and the driver will just carry him to the stoop.
They all laughed at Lin-Manuel Miranda.
- That's true.

[Knock on door]
Well, hey, there, Brick.

Thank you for saying so.
Now you have a great day and be fierce.
I will.
See, that's supportive parenting right there.

Hey!
Who is ready for an eight-hour lecture on polymers?
I'll give you hint...
It's me!
Yeah.

Uh, so, Mike, uh, how's things at the quarry?
A little rocky?

Kidding.
Uh, anyhoo, do you guys have seminars, too?
No.

The job's pretty much the job.
Mm-hmm.

And feel free to go into detail.
Drive safe.
You were looking on the wrong side.
I told you, the pain is on his left side.
- Frankie, this is cuckoo.

I need my chair and my light and my spit sucker.
His tooth is killing him, but I haven't been able to get him to a dentist in years, so I am sorry, but if you want to diagnose him, you got to do it here.
Now get in there.

Oh.

I sure like coffee.
Uh, how do you take your coffee?
Do you take it bla-a-ck or with cre-e-e-am?
Black.
Cool.
Ooh!
Hey, can I show you my new phone?
It's got all sorts of neat stuff on here.
It can tell you how many steps you've stepped.
It can tell you the temperature in Charlotte.
It's even got a camera on it.
- [Camera shutter clicks]

[Camera shutter clicking]
Frankie!
Really?
Well, I'm sorry, but you've been in pain for months, and you won't go see anybody.
You won't go see the dentist.

- And I haven't died yet.

You don't have to feel embarrassed, you know?
A lot of people are hinky about the dentist.
Well, thank you for that, but I'm not hinky about anything.
I just don't like the idea of someone poking around
- where they got no business being.

I just want you to take care of yourself, all right, and now is the time to do it when I have free dental care.
Please?

I can't get Axl to do anything.
Right.

Enough talking about it.

- You happy?

There's a lot of road to travel between me and that destination, but I am relieved.
Thank you.
And don't worry, Mike.
I promise, I'll be gentle.
Look at these little woman hands.
When I hold hands with a girl, sometimes I can't tell who's who.

Lexie, we're gonna need more milk.
Aurora: "Milk" has been added to your shopping list.
Okay, I'm sorry.

You got used to the 36 jets in the tub.
- You can do this.

I'll tell you another thing I can get used to...
- [Singsong] a possible boyfriend!

Is it the super-hot guy that drives the Jeep?
[Normal voice] No, it's the attainable guy who drives a golf cart.
Who?
You know, Tyler, the safety-cart guy who takes injured people around during the day and drunk people home at night?
He kind of looks like Woody from "Toy Story."
[Gasps] Oh!
Well, Woody's definitely the hottest one in "Toy Story."
I know, right?
Anyway, he seems super sweet and nice, but I'm not sure if he's interested in me.
Every time it seems like something's maybe about to happen, we get to where we're going, and I have to get out.
Next time, tell him you have to go to the Pharmacy Building.
That's, like, practically off campus.
Oh.

[Grunts] I hope he likes me.
I need a man!
"Man" has been added to your shopping list.
Oh, she's good.
Mm-hmm.
[Sighs]
I'm surprised you didn't want to come in on a day Frankie was working.
She is such a hoot.
Sometimes she pretends to nod off while working and slumps right over onto her patient.
[Chuckles]
So, here's how this is gonna work.
You're gonna tell Frankie you checked out my tooth, it's fine, and that's gonna be the end of it.
Oh.

That would be a lie.

What would I tell Frankie?
Well, if it makes you feel better, we can go grab a beer and that way when she says, "How'd it go?"
you can say you spent an hour with me and I was happy, and that would all be true.
Okay, I guess I'm in.

Uh!

We're like Thelma and Louise.

Now, the fridge holds up to three cans of your favorite beverage and an apple.
Now, you might want to supplement that with a cooler or two, but on the plus side, you can use them for seats.

It's not for everyone. [Chuckles]
[Cellphone ringing]
- Hello?

Yes.

So, I did what you said.
When Frankie asked how it went, I said, "Fine."
Great.
Wait.

I said you had mesial distal occlusal with a slight pulp horn exposure.
You got that?
Mesial distal occlusal with a slight pulp horn exposure.
Or you could have just said you took care of it, and we're done.
I wish you would have told me that before, 'cause I said yoneed to come in for a follow-up appointment.
Why'd you tell her that?
Because you had a mesial distal occlusal
- with a slight pulp horn exposure!

Listen, if we're gonna get away with this, we got to get our story straight.
This thing lives or dies in the details.
Now, Frankie's coming home with the appointment card.
Just act casual.
This conversation never happened.

What?

No.

Hey, I got your call, and I rushed right over.
Of course, I'm not sure it can be classified as rushing at six miles an hour.

Oh, thanks for picking me up from the party.
I walked by some kids who were smoking, and I held my breath for as long as I could, but then I had to take a breath.
And I don't know what they were smoking, but it could have been marijuana, because one of them had a knit hat on.
- Sounds like I got here just in time.

Yeah.
Yeah, so... the whole party thing's not really my scene.
- Yeah, me neither.

Yeah, I'd much rather have, like, a nice dinner, cozy evening in, maybe watch some Netflix.
I'm basically 40.
[Laughs] Mm-hmm.
Anyway, I'll have you home in just a minute.
Oh, actually, I have to go to the Pharmacy Building to pick up a notebook.
Sorry.

No, I don't mind.

Oh, it's so bad, it's good.

Dude, you got to get me to the grad dorm fast, 'cause that's where I live.

Well, well, well.

Shh!

Uh, yeah.

Oh!

W-We dated a little bit?

So...

No!

I-I-I just breathed something in that I shouldn't have, okay?
That's all.

Wait, Jeremy.

You get over yourself.

It's imitation... just like your love.

I have to puke, and I want to do it on the Econ Building

Listen, I realized when we left the office to go get a beer,
- we were onthe security cam.

So if Frankie sees the tape, she'll know that we left early, and I wouldn't have had time to do a mesial distal occlusal with slight pulp horn exposure.
Look, you're way overthinking this.
Why would Frankie ever look at the security tape?
Doesn't matter.

I told Frankie you and I went outside because there were miscreants in the parking lot.
We wanted to see what they were up to.
They ran away, but they'd broken into my car and stole my coat.
That's why I'm not wearing one now.
