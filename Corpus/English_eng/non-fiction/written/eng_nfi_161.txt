The Defenders 1x02 Mean Right Hook
What's happening?
All units, we got a 10-66.
Requesting backup immediately.
Too late for that.
Don't you run from me... you looter sons of bitches!
Oh, shit!
Run!
Come on, you pieces of shit!
You want some, too?
Who are you?
I hear your neighborhood was hit pretty hard, so call me so I know you're okay.
Thank you.
Holy shit.
Trish, it's really scary when something like this happens.
What do I tell my kids?
After everything we've been through, we can't help but think it's the incident or terrorism.
True, but there's nothing to worry about.
The mayor's office confirmed this morning, it was a 4.6 magnitude earthquake.
A shallow one, actually, centered in Hell's Kitchen.
I'm told seismologists are looking at a fault line on the Hudson to see if it could be the source of the problem.
Not an earthquake, that's for sure.
Look, I know it's easy to give into fear, but...
Shallow earthquakes can be up to 50-miles deep.
But whatever happened last night was only 300-feet deep...
Wait, what?
Hello?
Okay, so it looks like phone lines may have been affected, too.
What the hell happened?
The interview with the school superintendent, boss says it's going on now.
Said we gotta lay off the earthquake stuff.
I don't know why, but from the tone they used, it was not a conversation.
Got here fast as I could, Captain.
Place like this, company motto is "No questions asked."
So whatever this is, we got orders to keep it away from the press.
Son of a bitch.
I told you these assholes were transporting explosives.
We sure it's them?
Uh, at the very least, I think it's connected.
Maybe the fireworks are theirs, and maybe somebody stole them from 'em.
Jessica Jones.
Says she was following a client.
Well, she ain't met you.
You gotta be kidding me.
So the guy who rented this room...
Now I have been here four hours.
Can I go now, dipshit?
You're done when we're done.
You got a mouth.
You noticed.
Ms. Jones, you can go for now.
Stupid son of a bitch.
Can you believe this chick?
Did she just take...
Hey!
Looks like we're good.
I don't see any damage.
Danny?
Danny...
Everything okay out there?
They're saying the epicenter was in Hell's Kitchen.
Hmm.
If I ever come across that warrior again, I'll be prepared.
I've been thinking about the man who died in the sewer.
I think he's our next lead.
Well, he died fighting the Hand, right?
That we have allies.
We're not alone in this.
No.
And he was also willing to die.
He might not have died if I hadn't left my post in K'un-Lun.
It's about fault.
All I'm saying is you're not the only person the Hand has ever hurt.
It was his fight, too.
And mine.
You're not alone in this.
So what?
We just go and find a team to join?
An army?
It's a shot in the dark, but I think it's one worth taking.
Okay.
So I guess you have a plan?
As a matter of fact...
His weapon, the sword he fought with...
There are maybe ten of these in the world.
If the guy who died in Cambodia ever had business here, maybe it was at that workshop.
And what if he didn't?
Then we keep looking.
What if it's a trap?
Then we fight our way out of it.
Danny, what?
You and I, we...
We haven't had the greatest luck trusting other people.
Yeah... but do you trust me?
Of course.
Hey, Foggy.
Just keep it clean.
Not a lot of people have insurance here.
Thanks to you.
You know, most people get out of jail and they, uh... pop a beer.
Maybe I will go get a drink.
I was thinking about going by Elmore's tonight.
Oh, I know it.
Has a reputation for a certain kind of crowd.
That's kinda what I was hoping.
Are you hunting criminals?
'Cause I thought you said you were gonna take it easy on that for a while.
Look, someone's hiring young men in Harlem to do their dirty work.
Misty said the NYPD doesn't know what these young men are doing, but the body count's growing, so...
Okay.
Is the NYPD gonna pay you for doing their job?
This one kid, he's too afraid to ask for help.
I gotta step in before anyone else gets hurt.
It's like you said, if we don't take responsibility for our neighborhood, no one else will.
If you're gonna rattle heads for answers, you should know no one goes to Elmore's anymore.
I've stitched up enough knife wounds at the shelter to know if you're looking for the current criminal hotspot,
the place to go is on 188th Street.
Rathole called Trouble and a Pair of Dice.
I'm told your donation to the Philharmonic should just about cover the remodeling.
A small price to pay in the larger scheme of things.
You know, with the kind of support you've provided, we would love to host you at our next gala.
I've always preferred a more intimate setting.
Of course.
The piece you've requested is a curious one.
Brahms didn't often write in C minor.
Matter of fact, that was Beethoven's key of choice.
But here, Beethoven's influence is quite pronounced.
All Brahms wanted was to prove that he could do it, too.
He was petty like that.
Your insight on music history, it never ceases to amaze me.
If you'll excuse me.
Of course.
Familiar phrases about K'un-Lun.
We've never encountered a wall before.
They knew we'd get here... eventually.
Perhaps we should rethink our plan.
That's always been the difference between us.
If they wanted to take this one from us forever, they would've destroyed it, not protected it.
It's a door.
It's meant to be opened.
By what?
The conviction of the elders of K'un-Lun was always unwavering.
They think it's a virtue.
But in the end, all it ever did was make them predictable.
They've locked it away.
But a lock is not a lock without a key.
And from the beginning, they have valued one thing above all else.
Okay.
What?
You've gotta be kidding me.
You've got to be kidding me.
I'm looking into this company, but they've been transferring assets from one corporation to the next.
Like, they're changing their name, shell company stuff.
Yet, I have no idea what it is they actually do.
Oh, so what do you need from me?
The oldest record dates back to 1820, but as crazy as this sounds, I need to go back further than that.
Oh, well, you... you wanna go to the historical branch uptown.
And you'll need an appointment.
Okay, thanks.
Actually, you don't.
Jessica, we need to talk.
Hogarth.
Been a long time, Josie.
I can't tell you how much I miss this place.
Oh, so Mr. Uptown misses our humble establishment.
How's work?
I heard about that settlement.
You sure you want to stay pro bono?
I'm just happy I could help.
Far from what we dreamed about doing when we were kids, but at least I get to see Marci a lot.
Naked, I mean.
That it has.
I don't mean to pry, but where you guys at?
Relationship status?
After you told her your little secret, lucky she didn't freak out and have us both disbarred.
You can trust me, too.
How you doing after last night?
That's not what I'm talking about.
Matt, stop!
Whatever you're going through, I'm not gonna judge.
But I do think I can help you through it.
I came to offer you something.
Ranging from petty bullshit to life-changingly important.
Most importantly, it's the type of stuff you're doing anyway.
If you take these, it'll keep you up-to-your-eyeballs busy.
And the next time you're on the fence about stepping out at night... you'll be too busy being another kind of hero.
But right now... it's the best I got.
What if it doesn't work?
Then we tried anyway.
In a city of nine million people, we just happen to bump into each other?
Are you having me followed?
I can't believe this.
I couldn't help but take it personally.
Maybe you should.
I'm here to ask you to be careful.
Whatever it is you stumbled onto last night, it's big.
Walk away.
Whatever this is, let the feds handle it.
After your rather explosive discovery last night, your client's husband has been placed on a federal watch list.
It's now a matter of national security.
Which means hundreds of law enforcement officers.
All it takes is one overzealous agent who wants to save the world, and this man, John Raymond, and anyone suspected of aiding him will be shot on sight.
There is nothing in this guy's profile that suggests he's a terrorist.
They just found enough C-4 in that motel room to level a city block.
What do you think it looks like?
The government is not going to rest until they've got him.
Is this about protecting me or protecting you?
They wouldn't have found those explosives if it weren't for you.
You actually saved lives today.
This only looks like plastic, but I'm telling you it's solid gold.
Earthquake has everyone going crazy.
Nobody's paying attention to the little things, like what is or isn't in their wallets.
How I get 'em is up to you.
Cage, what part of this shit looks like it's up to me?
If they got their hands in anything, it ain't stuff I've seen.
Then who's recruiting kids out of Harlem and getting them killed?
Look, I'd love to help, but I don't know shit.
I think you do.
I don't know his name.
Everyone just calls him White Hat on account of his unique fashion sense.
Try around 151st and Amsterdam.
If this isn't the truth, I'll be back.
And you won't like me then.
I don't like you now.
Hello?
Is it weird that I wanna live here?
Danny.
Danny, this is a Tsukamoto.
Huh.
Just like the one you showed me.
Yeah.
But you don't sharpen these.
Unless you plan on using them.
Danny...
Oh, my God.
It hasn't been long.
He's still warm.
Hey.
Someone was dragged out of here.
This must have been the Hand.
Then who are these people?
I don't know.
Danny?
What is it?
It's K'un-Lun.
I think I found something.
You should get a warrant and get down here.
I may have found a lead.
See you later.
Okay.
Someone who used to work here, a freelancer...
Now you and I never had this conversation, but the second she gets herself into trouble, priority one is keeping that trouble very far away from us.
Okay.
Hey.
Jess, where have you been?
Something weird's going on at the studio.
Weird how?
This tremor stuff, I think...
I think they want me to sweep it under the rug.
Trish, I gotta call you back.
Malcolm, what did I tell you about coming in my apartment?
I told you to stop following me.
It doesn't make sense.
Why do these people have a picture of K'un-Lun?
And what else did they know?
Someone's coming.
You guys start over there.
What are they doing?
I don't know.
But they're not gonna get away with this.
Your wife came to me.
She was worried.
Right now, I wish I'd listened.
Are you working with them?
With who?
You know who I'm talking about.
I work alone.
Always has.
Look, like I said, I'm barely on the payroll.
Okay, whatever you think is going on... whatever you think is happening here...
And next, they'll come after my family.
Make sure you tell her that.
Okay, with any luck, you're gonna tell her that yourself.
And the cops...
They just wanna know why you started stockpiling explosives.
What?
There's nowhere to go.
To be honest, if you hurt my friend, I'm gonna hurt you worse.
I was just trying to stop them.
I can't help you if you won't tell me who.
I should never have come here.
You can't have this.
You okay?
Hold it right there.
Get your hands up!
Now!
Hey there, assholes.
Don't lie to me!
In between gigs, huh?
Hey!
What are you made of?
Just remember, you started this.
Stay down.
Freeze!
Get on your knees, now!
Everyone else on your side is dead.
You know who I am, I know who you are, so let's skip the wartime banter.
Time is not something I can afford to waste.
Not for your benefit but for mine, I'm taking the blinds off.
Try not to bite, old friend.
It's undignified.
Alexandra.
Stick.
We have so much to talk about.
John Raymond, the body we found in your office slash apartment.
Malcolm Ducasse, your friend being interrogated down the hall.
And Jessica...
Really?
You have been a huge pain in my ass all day, you know that?
But you might have interrupted a city-wide investigation.
And you got my one lead killed.
Well, now all they have to worry about are funeral arrangements.
Your office is currently a crime scene, but I need your cooperation.
Officer, unless you have a reason to hold me...
Look, I know that you think you're just doing your job, but I'm telling you, this case isn't normal.
You are walking into some weird-ass shit.
Jessica Jones, stop talking.
Hi, this is over.
Who the hell are you?
