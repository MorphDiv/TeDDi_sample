My story is one as old as time.
- You're Burnin' Vernon.

The guy from the '90s, sang that one song.
My descent down to rock bottom was just as swift.
After jail, I recruited my buddy Walt to help me impersonate a preacher.
I needed some quick cash to pay off my baby mama, Debbie, for my 15-year-old daughter, Charlotte.
Say what?
Debbie's boyfriend, Ronnie, got himself blown up.
Debbie was left with a little secret.
I'm pregnant.
I found myself back in jail.
- This sucks.

♪ You good?

♪ Do you ever sit alone ♪
♪ Staring at your phone ♪
♪ A bit misunderstood ♪
♪ You good?

♪ You good ♪
I'm gonna miss having you on the inside, Vernon.
Time's up.
Almost there.
Are you kidding me?
Come on, soap man.
I'm gonna miss you, you slippery son of a bitch.
Walter Murray, time to go.
Oh, already?
I didn't get around to showering this morning.
Guys!
Over here!
He started digging that dang tunnel first day we was in there.
How far did ya make it?
Like 30 more minutes, I would have been home free.
But you're home now.
It's just not the same.
Here you go, boys.

Oh, are you kidding me?
Half of what they fed us in there tasted like wet, rotten cabbage.
Especially the cabbage.
You have no idea how boring it was without you two.
Mm.

Well, you know what?
How 'bout we do a shot to celebrate?
Alrighty.
How you like it here, Deb?
It's cool.
You know, low pressure.
I don't have to take the work home with me.
Hey, what about you?

Oh, um...
Oh, you know, I can't drink on the job.
Well, what in the hell's the sense in working here, I'd say.
Maybe to pay the mortgage.
Well, we all got our priorities, I reckon.
Mom, why won't you tell him the real reason
- you're not drinking?

He just got out.
It's not the right time.
Okay, when's the right time?
I'm tired of keeping this a secret.
You just...
How are my two favorite parolees, huh?
Fellas, it's been forever.
We saw you yesterday, Doily.
Yeah, but you can't hug through prison bars, huh?
- Huh?

Best first night out of prison I can ever remember.
Free beers, fried chicken, whoo.
Beers aren't free, Vern.
Well, excuse me, fellas.
Alright, alright.
Seriously, man, how long has it been?
Like 11 hours.
Nah, come on, how long's it been?
Eleven hours.
Hey, Deb...

It's tragic.
If there's anything I can do, you let me know.
Well, thank you, Vernon.
Actually, um... there is something
I wanted to talk to you about.
Ronnie's stuff in the basement, you know,
I just...

Are you talking about all that boat crap downstairs?
It's nautical memorabilia, you know, so I don't wanna just throw it out.
Do you know anyone who might want it?
I don't know a whole lot of sailors, but I guess I can ask around.
So now that you're a free man, what's your plan?
Or do you even have one?
All I know for sure is, being on the inside helped me realize...

My career.
Missing out on my little girl growing up.
I did all that.
I did it to myself.
Now I just wanna get back to the real me.
My music.
Even if it means living in my car.
I think that's great.
You do?
Yes, Vern, I've always been a fan of your music.
You don't have to sleep in your car.
Alright, just stay in the basement.
This is strictly platonic.
Well, wait a minute now.
Uh, platonic doesn't mean we can't fool around now and again, does it?
That's exactly what platonic means.
Looks like table three's almost ready for their check.
Do you mind settling up with them and locking up tonight?
Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.
Thanks.
My sitter just sent me a picture of a bite mark courtesy of my four-year-old.
This is Vern.
Vern this is Kaitlyn.
She owns the bar.
Pleasure to meet you, Ma'am.
The pleasure's all yours.
I've heard stories.
Thanks, Debbie.
Good to know my reputation is still intact.
You reap what you sow.
Oh, look who's the preacher now.
If you can do it, apparently anyone can.
Uh, look at us bantering on like an old married couple.
Next thing you know, we'll be arguing over which side of the bed to sleep on.
Not gonna happen, Vern.
You're in the basement... on a cot.
Hey, check it out.
Who wants a free game of pool?
I got a better idea.
Hell's far.
Look like somebody had a damn party.
What the hell?
Hey, Deb, look what I found.
Morning, Vernon.
- Sheri and I were...

Sheila and I were just bonding over our taste in men.
Yeah.

Sounds like pretty solid advice.
Hi, honey.
Um, this is your dad's friend Sheila.
She just stopped by for an early breakfast.
Okay, Mom, please.
Vernon, gross.
And no offense, Sheila.
None taken.
You know what?

Look, that's my ride.
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah, it's nice meeting you.
You can just leave the shirt at the door there.
Please tell me she's at least in college.
She's working her way through law school.
You'd think she'd be a little bit smarter.
Stop.
Have you figured out what to do with Ronnie's stuff?
Well, I believe this may have some answers.
Where did you find this?
Well, I was organizing Ronnie's stuff, and came across it.

I didn't even know about it.
Where are we gonna play this thing?
1985.
Yeah.
I mean, who even has VCRs anymore?
Now, do you want VHS or BETA?
Because depending on the year the tape was made and its size, either format could be applicable to these recorder.
Okay.
If you are watching this, it's probably because some tragedy has befallen me, and the nation mourns for me.
The time has come for ol' Ronnie to shed this beautifully toned mortal coil and move into the great beyond.
The great adventure at sea in the sky.
First, my mortal remains will be cast atop a gilded vessel such as such while a choir of Valhalla's Knights sings my praises with timeless classics from badass martial arts' movies.
A lone archer will let loose a single arrow... catching the pyre and my mortal remains ablaze.

He does not look Nordic at all.
He's Scots Irish.
Um...
Maybe he's just joking around.
Just to be clear, this is not a joke.
Failure to service these requests will result in a nonstop haunting by me,
Ronnie, forever, ever...
Well, I don't want a Ronnie poltergeist.
But there's no way I can pull all this off.
- Ever...

I'll go downstairs and see if I can find a sequel to this thing.
My boy, my boy.
Debbie got us living down here in a Ronnie junkyard.
I feel like I'm caught in a trap.
I can't walk out without getting some of Ronnie's [bleep]
On my blue suede shoes.
You got that right.
I got an idea for you, son.
Ronford wants a floating funeral, what better way to get rid of him and his memory than put him on a float of fire and get rid of all this nautical crap.
I think I catch our drift.
Hey, good news and bad news!
Bad news is I didn't find another tape.
The good news is, all we gotta do is work together as a team, divide up the task, and we can do this.
- Really?

I mean, I'll be charge of the floating funeral boat fire deal.
I can load up all of Ronnie's stuff.
And, Walt, I bet you know stuff about Vikings.
Well, I mean, I'm no expert, but I studied a little bit on.
Come on, what do you say?
Let's do this!
- Come on, we can do.

Everybody!

Doily, how'd you get in here?
You guys leave your windows unlocked at night.
That's not a good idea, it's dangerous.
Anyway, one, two, three!
Family!
Family!
Family!
Family.
Did you come in through a window?
Yeah, bedroom window, yeah.
I think you should really stick with Mom.
Hey, Deb, why don't you ride with me?
Go for it.

Come on, it'll be fun.
Does it smell like stripper in your car?
Uh, just a little bit.
Am I gonna get glitter on my ass?
Let's hope so.
Here, let me get the door for you, my lady.
Here you go.
What's first on your list there?
Uh, great.
I just never understood spending a bunch of money on a fancy box just to drop it in a dirt hole.
I think it's nice to show appreciation for someone when they're gone.
I think it's nice to show appreciation for someone while they're still here.
Vernon, look, I need to talk to you about something.
Well, hey, folks, can I help ya?
Hey, Haus, these things sure ain't cheap, are they?
Oh, trust me, Sir, we receive them at wholesale prices, and there's very little markup.
This one looks nice.
This is our top-of-the-line model with all the bells and whistles.
That thing got cup holders.
Yeah, my father recently passed away and took two tall boys with 'im.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Was he sick?
Actually, he was the picture of health.
We was on a family camping trip.
And he was involved in a bear attack.
- Whoa!

Um, I'm sorry, Sir, how much is this one?
Question for you.
Would you buy a new car without taking it for a test drive?
No.
And yet you will not spend eternity in your car.
Well, evidently, you've never been a struggling musician.
Which is why you should take this beauty for a test spin.
How's that?
Come on, get in.
No, I'm good.
No, no, no, no.

The first time I laid in this, I was sold.
If I'm lying, I'm dying.
Trust me, that whole Viking funeral boat burning thing is kind of a myth.
I mean, boats were far too valuable to go around burning every time some horn-headed goon bit the dust.
But don't get me wrong.

Okay, obviously, I do, too.
- Well, all we gotta do is...

Hey!

You do know they're just regular arrows that you later set on fire?
That makes way more sense.
Come on, Doil, let me handle the pyrotechnics.
I mean, I've blown up a ton of crap.
Also, I don't know anything about flower arrangements.
Neither do I.
Well, as luck would have it,
I know a lot about flower arrangements.
Having spent thousands of dollars on them, trying to win my ex-wife Cynthia back.
Did it work?
All in good time, Charlotte.
All in excruciatingly painful months and years of waiting for the tiniest glimpse of hope's time.
Uh.
Talking to myself again.
Gotta stop doing that, Doily.
Mm, it's a little tight.
Well, trying folding your arms like this.
Whoo.

I find the full effect to be helpful in purchasing.
Oh, no, no, we're good, we're good.
- We'll take this one.

How much is it?
Let's see.

You don't want the insects or vermin to be able to dig their way inside.
Look, Haus, I know what you're trying to do here, taking advantage of a grieving woman, pushing your big, expensive caskets.
Point is, there's no body.
I mean, the guy was blown to kingdom come.
Went up like a cheap piñata full of gasoline.
I mean, nothing left but burnt charcoal, fish food.
Vernon!
Listen, Dan, we're operating on a string budget.
And especially, it's gonna stay empty.
Oh.
Well... that is a horse of a different color.
I think I got an idea that will make you both happy.

I just don't know what she sees in the guy.
- You know what I'm saying?

Hey, Mabel, where did you find this kids' choir?
Has Mom told Vernon yet?
No, she keeps putting it off.
But what if it's his?
I know, that's the awkward thing.
I mean, I'd tell him myself, but I'm not the pregnant one.
Come on, let's go.
Wow.
Yeah, I thought Ronnie said a selection of his most treasured possessions.
Well, Ronnie cared about a lot of crap.
Besides, you don't want that stuff hanging around, reminding you guys of Ronnie.
And, what, cluttering up your bachelor pad?
You don't get sassy with me, young lady.
And don't think I can't smell whiskey from a mile downwind.
Give me that.
Whoo!
You know this stuff will kill ya?
You think he'll tell my Dad?
He's a lot of things, but he's no snitch.
People often ask me what I saw in Ronnie.
Especially his mother.
I guess when it comes down it...
I just never met anyone like him.
I mean, Ronnie was Ronnie.
You never really saw him do something he didn't fully commit to doing.
You know, especially when it came to his kara-tay.
He loved the martial arts, low-intensity workouts.
And he loved me.
And most important, Ronnie was loyal... to me, Charlotte, our family.
I'll always be grateful for that.
And last, but certainly not least,
Ronnie loved boats of all kinds.
So we've gathered here today on the shores of this beautiful lake where Ronnie was last seen.
He asked that this poem be read.
"By the grace of Oden's spear,"
"I bequeath unto you,"
"Mother Ocean, the remains"
"of one of your fallen warrior sons."
"He will soon will alight on the shores of Ascar..."
Ascard.
"He will soon alight on the shores of Ascard"
"and reign forever by Oden's side."
Goodbye, Ronnie, we'll miss you.
Freeze!
Don't you dare shoot that arrow!
It's against the law to burn your trash on the lake.
Do not do that or else.
Or else what?
Like it's a $75 fine.
I got five bucks.
I've got like 43... 37 cents.
I got seven dollars and... uh, 59 cents.
I have 11 dollars in Buffalo nickels.
Alright, I got $8.04.
Okay, we're all square.

That was some quick math.

Shoot.
Alright.
Aim higher.
Try to let the wind catch it.
Holy!
I did not see that coming.
I'm pregnant, Vernon, and it might be yours.
Okay, probably not the best time.
