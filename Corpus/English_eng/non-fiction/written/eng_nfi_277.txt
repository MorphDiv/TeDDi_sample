We're just so happy that you're here to help take care of Nicky.
Un cochon.
I-I-I don't see the point of getting a nanny from Haiti who doesn't speak English.
We need to look at cutting back on staff.
Cut back on more staff.
What am I supposed to be doing?
Those people are our responsibility.
I don't want all of this to come between us.
How come you never say anything during group?
Just don't have nothing to say.
I'm pregnant again.
And I'm not gonna keep it.
The judge will grant the abortion if you're under 20 weeks.
Just in case.
My son.
You killed him.
Tell us about the farm.
Why you care so much about the farm?
Tell us about the workers, their conditions, housing.
My brother is dead!
Somebody killed him.
You don't give a damn about that?
People die all the time on that farm.
Nobody cares.
Women get raped regular.
The workers...
Sometimes we got like 15 or 20 of them living in a trailer, no air.
Everybody knows they're firetraps.
They make us house them off property.
So if anything happens, they don't have to take any of the blame.
It's all set up so the people up top don't get dirty.
Tell me about the river.
Diego, tell me about the river.
Did your brother kill Teo Salazar?
Did your brother put his body in the river?
We put a lot of bodies in that river.
So, how does it work?
Customers buy tokens online.
There's a flat fee for them to log on to the site.
And they like what you're doing, they'll tip you.
It's all about earning tips.
All right?
They get off just talking, talking's all you need.
They want other stuff... it's just what you what you want to do to get tipped.
Okay.
I got to get...
Is he cool?
Everett?
He's real cool.
Pays on time.
Soon as you make your tips, he pays.
Have to help out around the house, do, chores and stuff, but that's about it.
Doesn't want any nonsense.
Just wants money.
It's not like that hoin' you did before.
It's like having a regular arrangement...
Log on, do your thing, log off.
Just sayin', you want to make money...
You don't do it like this.
You can't go name by name.
The cuts we have to make, we've got to do them wholesale.
We've got to cut departments.
We've got to cut entire shifts.
My.
You guys take care of him right?
You better share!
Nicky.
Just gonna bump it to next week.
Not so high!
Oui.
Well...
Ça va.
Ça va, aller.
Bien.
Mom, why don't we teach Gabrielle English?
Because I want Gabrielle to teach you French.
Gabrielle, tell... tell Nicky a little bit about your family.
Tu...
Non.
Non.
His name's Yves.
Je...
Same game every time.
Just going up to the room real quick.
I would like a room.
Yeah.
Hello.
What are you doing?
H-How did you find me?
Nobody told me.
You checked in with the credit card.
But why the hell are you staying at a hotel?
I left you a note.
I couldn't understand the note.
Well... it was very clear what I was saying.
Okay, you need to breathe.
I mean, what the hell does that mean?
Well, I-I need to figure some things out, separate from you, separate from the family.
I don't understand what I did.
Hello?
Hello, Jeanette?
Just come home.
I need to check out.
Was there something wrong with the room?
Yeah, well, I guess we will.
Please consider adoption.
There are so many families who are looking for a child to love.
If it's an option for you, please call us at this number.
So you'll...
Yeah, so you'll...
No problem.
Thank you.
I don't want to do this.
You don't want to... do...
I don't want to do this.
If you have the baby, how are you gonna take care of it?
What are you gonna do for food, for... clothes?
I have the right to have a baby.
I'm not saying you don't have the right.
I'm just asking, how are you gonna provide?
If you go past 20 weeks, you can't have the abortion.
It's not your business what I do.
It's not.
If you want me to take you to the shelter, I will.
Ok...
Okay.
Okay.
Is there a problem?
Well, it... it asks for work history.
What if I don't have a history?
None?
I've been a housewife for 23, 24 years and...
You can put "housewife."
I know that from personal experience.
Um...
And...
Well, "pay stubs."
Leave that blank.
Just put your bank information.
Well, it's, um...
It's a joint account.
I-It's just to establish a credit history for the rental agreement.
No, my husband and I, we're...
Well, I-I...
I need some time away, and I'm not sure he, he understands that yet.
If you don't have some kind of a personal account, you're not gonna be able to rent a room.
Well, I ne...
I need someplace to stay.
If your husband is...
Is he abusive to you?
My husband and me, we have all kinds of things we have to deal with, but, sometimes you just have to deal with things.
I don't want to start a battle.
I-I don't want to fight about money or anything.
I just want enough from Carson to live on.
You want a settlement?
You want a divorce?
No.
I don't want a divorce.
I want... 24 years.
You want a temporary separation?
Yeah.
Now, with a separation, your husband isn't required to give you any support.
Now, you can't file for divorce until you and your husband have had a full year of formal separation.
That's the law in North Carolina.
And if you formally separate, you can file for post-separation support.
But it could take three to four months to get a hearing.
Would you like to start the process of formal separation?
I'd be willing to do the work on a contingency basis.
I wouldn't bill you until you settle with your husband.
My.
Nous ne serons sortis que quelques heures.
Sinon, je t'enverrai un text...
Let's go, please.
You gonna be good tonight, yeah?
Clair, let's go.
Bonsoir.
How long this thing supposed to be tonight?
Well, you know, I don't want to be closing up the place, as usual.
It will only be a couple hours.
Okay, good.
You didn't say good night to Nicky when we left tonight.
Well, I just think you needed...
Maybe she'll come back.
People who've spent most of their lives being exploited, it is very easy to return to exploitation.
I mean, even while being exploited, for a lot of the victims, it's like they have some false sense of liberation.
People who've been abused most of their lives, they're led to believe that there's at least a benefit to their circumstances.
O-our organization has partnered with Polaris.
They're a nonprofit NGO...
Established to combat modern-day slavery and human trafficking.
Thank you.
Good to see you, too.
Modern-day slavery.
In the rest of the world, it's called a job.
Drinking alone, or just drinking?
I got another 40 minutes to kill while my wife makes friends with everybody here.
Getting divorced added an extra three hours back into my day.
Brent Welch.
Nick Coates.
Coates?
Yeah, that's mine.
No lie?
"America's most comfortable furniture."
I used to have a bunch of your stuff.
Used to?
Wife took 'em.
Was.
And that's for damn sure.
Outsourcing, yeah, it forced my hand.
Regulators, unions' taxes...
I spent the last six years bleeding jobs to the other side of the planet.
The minute you start talking about trying to turn a profit, you... everybody accuses you of corporate greed.
Hell if they'll ever have a night like this for us.
5,500 of those cases, they were identified as human trafficking.
75% of those involve sex trafficking, and a third of those involve minors.
My daughter lives with her mother.
No matter if she wants me to pay for every damn thing she can right-click online.
When she talks to me at all, she's riding me about white male privilege.
The myth of white male privilege.
You got kids, Nick?
One.
He's five.
That's great!
Running around here somewhere.
Basically left the business.
Should have another platter for your bag.
My wife never worked.
It's beneath her.
She's "Old South."
Yeah, wouldn't that be something?
Yeah, you just...
You just drop out and kick back at home.
Okay.
I should be able to retire by the time I'm 89, 90.
It's our burden except we don't get a hashtag.
Yeah, he's just starting.
Yeah.
Good to meet you.
Hello.
Hi.
Thank you so much for your presentation.
Thank you.
I just... appreciate having the chance to talk about the issue.
Clair Coates.
Yeah, nice to meet you, Clair.
Nice to meet you.
You know...
I was curious, what you were talking about, about people being exploited.
It's not like it was...
Um, now, they don't always have a choice.
If your choice is between starving and selling yourself, what do you do?
If your choice is between getting beaten or listening to what your abuser tells you... dying or living...
We're the ones that have the choice because we actually can do something.
I thought my nanny had texted, 'cause she's home with my son.
She's new.
How old is he?
Well, Nicky's my miracle baby.
How so?
I could not get pregnant.
I tried for years...
Third opinion, fourth.
They told me I had to adopt.
I just kept trying.
I found a fertility clinic in Charlotte.
Expensive.
Yeah.
It took nine IVF procedures to conceive Nicky.
Yeah.
You know, I'd like to make a donation.
I would like to make it in the name of my son.
What is the name of your organization?
Project Open Road.
Project Open Road?
Yeah.
Open road.
Well, you are doing...
You're doing important work.
Yeah, we like to think that we are.
Well...
Here to tell you you are.
God bless.
Thank you.
Bye-bye now.
Right.
Looking good!
Well, the drinks were overpriced.
Well, I think it's nice getting together.
Um, now aren't you glad I hired Gabrielle, right, so we didn't have to scramble for a sitter?
Yeah, because it's impossible to find a sitter unless you fly one in from another country.
I made a donation.
What kind of donation?
In Nicky's name.
What kind of donation?
$5,000.
Well, it's a tax deduction.
You know that a business,
I-it has to show a profit to...
To take a write-off, don't you?
What do you mean, to show you a profit?
If you need help with accounting, I can help.
It's, what's going on with any business.
W-We need to compete.
Is it bad?
No, it's not bad.
Well, if you need help, I can help.
What are you, gonna wave a magic wand, Clair...
Y-You had your miracle baby, so, what, now you're capable of miracles, is that it?
You know, I hear you telling your silly little miracle-baby story to anybody who's gonna listen, and I'm gonna tell you something.
Is it really heartwar...
Well, I'm killing myself seven days a week in that office.
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing all day, Clair?
We hired a nanny so you can just sit around and write checks.
I hired a nanny so there'd be somebody else in the house to help take care of our son.
Shae?
She's not here.
But it's... past curfew.
Yeah, she checked out a couple hours ago.
Checked out and went where?
She's not at the shelter.
I understand, but I can't spare anyone.
I did for you.
You did your job.
Then do your job and find her.
With who?
My whole staff got shifted.
Now the D.A. is doubling down on abuses in the local ag business.
There are minors on the farms, too.
Sex trafficking takes a back seat to all of that.
And I've got a missing child.
That's my priority.
Look, the D.A. decides which cases to build.
He doesn't ask what I want to chase.
I just do what they tell me to do.
What's a good name to use?
Brandy.
Brandy?
Come on, that sounds like an alcoholic.
Do "Cassi."
Who's Cassi?
I don't know.
Just sounds like some girl I'd like to have sex with.
You doing okay?
There's food in the freezer.
I'm getting by.
Did you plan all this?
I don't want to argue, but I'm not the one who walked out.
I'm not the one who decided that leaving a bunch of food behind was gonna...
I...
I don't understand what is going on.
This all because I wouldn't let you help those people?
They died, and you don't care.
If you... if you want to help, we can go to a shelter.
We could...
I want...
Can you...
I...
I need some money, Carson.
To live on.
For the time being.
Well, what's the time being?
I just want to be on my own.
If you want to be in our own, be on your own.
Do you even understand why I left you?
I gave you everything I had.
I treated you too good?
People died, and you denied it.
I tried to do right, and you stopped me.
You sat across from your sister...
And treated me like a stranger.
That's what hurts the most.
We should've had kids.
We didn't want children.
We should've... should've given ourselves something.
Something so that our lives weren't just about us.
We let ourselves get too selfish.
And I don't know that the farm's gonna be around much more.
We got police coming by every day now.
We got Spanish-speaking investigators coming by to talk to workers.
They're looking to pin this on somebody.
This nonsense.
Nonsense?
You and JD.
You stirred this up, and now you want to walk away and leave me and Laurie Ann holding the bag.
Then send me an address, and I'll write you monthly allowances until you get over yourself.
I don't want a handout.
I want what's owed me.
Owed?
For what?
It's...
If this is about who owes who, the judge can sort that out.
I left him.
Can I stay with you and the girls?
Come on in.
Okay.
Okay, très biens.
Maintenant la chanson.
You okay?
Gabrielle...
So, I need lay-off notices for Burlington and Charlotte to go out.
I'll get them out today.
Make sure that HR at both plants understands that we can't offer a severance package... none.
Yeah.
Now, should we plan on any pushback from the union?
They'll picket the shuttered plants.
Week or so of that, they'll get bored and go home.
You're doing the right thing.
The right thing.
Hello.
I need help.
Who am I speaking with?
Vanessa.
Vanessa, this is Kimara.
My john's in the other room.
He hit me.
I'm bleeding.
Is he threatening you now?
I think he's passed out, but I'm afraid to go out there.
Kimara, the phone's dying.
They won't come.
I don't want to do this.
I don't want to do this anymore.
I want to go home.
All right, all right.
Well, where are you?
A motel.
Pine Ridge.
I'm gonna stay on the phone with you.
I'm scared.
I know you are.
Kimara, the phone's dying.
Okay.
When I get to the parking lot,
I'm gonna honk my horn three times.
Vanessa.
Vanessa.
Hey!
Hey, you're not done!
Come on, get in the car.
What'd you say?
