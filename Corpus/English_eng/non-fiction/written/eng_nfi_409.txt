Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
S.H.I.E.L.D. still needs a face.
Keep the title, but when it comes to operations,
I'm calling the shots.
And all the answers it holds.
Though poor Fitz -- we could just reboot the head -- in a controlled environment -- and then we could diagnose the problem together.
Please!
Drop it.
I'm gonna figure out what broke you.
[ Electronic voice ] Thank you, Fitz.
Will there be another opportunity to acquire the darkhold?
Agent may's decoy will be more convincing.
Her programming operates on a subconscious level.
If agent may isn't aware of her mission to retrieve the darkhold, then she won't be able to reveal herself.
She'll instinctively climb the ranks, gain access, and get closer to agent coulson, the man who knows just where this book is.
[ Exhales sharply ]
Didn't think you'd get stuck on a milk run to Radcliffe's.
We're gonna miss you in the field.
I'll catch up.
Can't let you have all the fun.
When this is over, it's time.
We are cracking that bottle.
You don't have to twist my arm.
I wish I'd been there to explain.
[ Sighs deeply ]
H-how did he take it?
He wants to use her on this, but concerned.
Concerned.
That's not a happy word.
Did -- did he say if -- he wants to talk, has questions.
I don't like those words, either.
[ Chuckles dryly ]
I hear you're on your way to personally escort aida.
Why?
Well, no one knows what she can do.
And she saw the darkhold.
Well, i could help with that.
No one's touching it.
When this is over, I'm destroying the book myself.
Because it's dangerous, yeah.
I-i-i understand.
You still need access to my apartment.
Maybe I could, uh -- no, that's never been a problem for me.
[ Chuckles ] Right, right, right.
Well, I'll reach out to aida, anyway, tell her to expect you.
Aida, I want you to access your information cache.
Locate the sunset protocol.
I have it, doctor.
Activate it.

You have to sedate her.
[ Coughing weakly ]
You bastard.
We may have misjudged what it takes [echoing] To keep agent may comfortable.
[ Monitor beeping ]
Seems to be working.
You found the solution, doctor.
Just not a permanent fix.
However, as long as our may replacement at the S.H.I.E.L.D. base does her job, it doesn't have to be.
Question -- why does it matter if the original may is dead or alive?
Aida?
It doesn't make logical sense.
We have cerebral replication.
We have physical replication.
No one in S.H.I.E.L.D. knows she's been replaced.
What empirical difference is there?
Well, for one thing, the framework is in beta testing.
We need may alive for calibration -- yes, but I -- but, also, we're not killers.
Nathanson was a drastic overadjustment.
But isn't it preferable to sacrifice one life to save millions?
Yes, as a last resort, aida.
Our may life model decoy should get us the darkhold eventually.
And if something goes wrong...
Then we have our safety net.
You're referring to the other android now in operation.
Yes.
Our second lmd.

It seems risky.
We're all aware of the dangers, some of us more than others.
I'm fine with it, Jemma.
And, coulson, you're letting her.
That -- it doesn't seem like you, either.
With nadeer and her staff in the meeting, we have an opportunity.
I wasn't briefed on any opportunity.
While nadeer's in with Daisy, yo-yo and i will get into her office and plant surveillance.
No, there'll be no planting, no eyeing, no yo-yo-ing.
S.H.I.E.L.D. is now legitimate.
We have to remain above reproach.
You mean like juicing our director so he can pretend to be inhuman?
Look, you are reacting to the situation we had.
You put Jeffrey in place, i understand, but we're S.H.I.E.L.D.
We have to be proactive.
This is politics, Phil, which means politicians.
They are a festering cesspool of toxic-waste fires.
You swim in those waters, you could get pulled under.
You and the director can handle it.
We'll handle the rest.

Gentlemen, agent MacKenzie requested personal time, so he's not with us on this.
Mack or no mack, I'm urging you to reconsider the second part of this mission.
Which part is the second part again?
The stupid part.
If she discovers you've launched an unauthorized investigation into her, it's gonna trigger an investigation into you.
There are always consequences.
It's dangerous, but she's dangerous.
And this is our chance to get ahead of it proactively.
Gentlemen, I'm sure we -- keep calling me reactive, Phil.
Half the time, I'm reacting to the steaming pile of fart-pebbles you hand me.
And the other half, you're not giving me the full story.
We're like the odd couple here.
Gentlemen, we have a mission.
At the very least, we need a contingency plan.
If she comes after you, she's gonna want S.H.I.E.L.D. records,
S.H.I.E.L.D. assets.
Let me take them to a military facility for protection.
That makes no sense.
Our people are trained to protect those assets.

You don't talk much about your childhood, do you?
The foster homes, bouncing around.
I imagine a lot of the time, it felt like you had to perform to convince people to like you.
Only the places i wanted to stay.

Because if you enter every room thinking you got to do a song and dance, eventually everything becomes a performance.
And believe me, i know how it feels putting on an act full-time.
Yeah.
You do, don't you?
Anyway, I know it's not an act with you.
Coulson's been saying since day one that you're the real deal, and I've learned to trust his read on people, so...
He believed in me before I believed in myself.
You too, you know.
It's why he wants you with us still.
He -- he keeps saying you were trying to do the right thing.
Oh, you've talked about it, huh?
Sure.

Thank you, Mr. chairperson.
Agent Johnson, as an inhuman yourself, do you feel more responsibility to help inhumans than normal Americans?
Well, first of all, inhumans are normal.
Let's be clear about that.
But with regard to whom I'll help,
I'm here for all Americans.
But more often than not, inhumans are left to fend for themselves with few resources.
Inhumans are more likely the victims of hate crimes, which is not fair.
They all deserve help, wherever they may be.

Agent Johnson, let's discuss your theft of more than $7 million from three banks while you were undercover from S.H.I.E.L.D.
Illegally acquired funds going towards illegal activity.

Has the U.S. government recovered those funds?
I see.
So you took the entire justice system into your own hands.

Hold.
I was working as a S.H.I.E.L.D. operative -- without signing the accords, so either you committed an illegal act by robbing banks or S.H.I.E.L.D. committed an illegal act by using an unauthorized enhanced agent.
Mr. chairman, this line of questioning -- and S.H.I.E.L.D. is still doing it.
Hold on.

Seems they were trying to install surveillance equipment to spy on my staff and me.
Uh, there -- there must be some mistake here.

She signed the sokovia accords, but now she's been caught red-handed in a S.H.I.E.L.D.-sanctioned operation without u.N. Approval, just as S.H.I.E.L.D. did with agent Johnson.
