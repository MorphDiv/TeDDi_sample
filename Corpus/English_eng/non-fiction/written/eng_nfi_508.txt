Transcribed by Uncle Andy
I think your father was murdered.

There's something in there that Constantine didn't want me to see.

I need to know if I made the worst mistake of my life.
Your husband had the copy made for some oligarch to put on his yacht.
I see it in you now.

What look?

Um, yes?

I tried to pin you down for quite some time.
I'm flattered.

Except that I never get to beat you!
That does not stop you from trying.

That does not stop you from trying.
Sometimes you get lucky.

Is that a surprise?

It's men finding more ways to make more money.
Oh, but you're different, right?

He won't see me?

I want to own my own collection.
I mean, you weren't born into it, you didn't inherit it, it's just you!
It's an obstacle.

You are their worst nightmare.
You crazy bastard!
You and I are cut from the same ice
Burning all the gold to sapphire skies
But the breeze is cold in paradise
I can feel the whispers in the street
Every night I shiver in my sleep
No reality, cause it's all a dream
Was it love?

Sparking fires, sparring wars with expensive things
I tiptoe right round my baby All this world is mad, mad crazy
Was it love?

Sparking fires, sparring wars with expensive things
I tiptoe right round my baby All this world is mad, mad crazy
Look, it's how they do things around here.

Using a sedative gas is much more effective than hitting people over the head
What were you thinking?

Badly wrong!

And you got what you wanted.
So, you had a look around...

I might have had a peek.

Do you think Constantine knew?

No, there's no way, though that does explain how Christos has been acting lately.
I also found something he may not have seen.
What's all this?

You've been here all night?

You look like you need it.

So, how's it going?

What is it about these kids that has got you so hot under the collar?
Come with me.
This is Bela.

Bela earns 12,000 Euros a year. 12,000.
And somehow, he supports 3 children and 7 grandchildren
He buys food, toys, pays his mortgage.
He even manages to take his wife out for a meal once a month.
And all the while, Bela pays a percentage of everything he earns, 2,000 Euros, to the State, to the Nation
But the Clios' of this world; they get away with paying almost nothing.
And every penny in tax, they don't pay... is taken away from Bela's hospitals, his schools, his Police service.
Look at him.

Well, most of Constantine Clios is in pieces at the bottom of the sea.
But I take your point.

I thought you're only after the Bank.

Everyone who steals money from me, from Bela, even from you.
Georgina Ryland, Class of '97
I've never even seen my Birth Certificate.
Fingerprints, our Marriage License, medical records my Mother's Death Certificate?
Why do you think he did this?
He never asked me for any of it.
Your middle name is Marjorie?
I have my grandmother to thank for that.
There's also this: bank statements.
I never knew about those bank accounts.
There must be thousands of transactions here.
All for tiny amounts from the Cayman Islands, Lichtenstein, the Bahamas...
There's a pattern here...

See, balance drops to zero.
A few months later, an even larger amount is transferred back in
And these transactions go to and from...

I do know what that money was for.
There, the Picasso?

27 million dollars, a record sale.

The Reuben?

The Gaugin, the Sheila?
All bought or sold, at Constantine's request, to or from John Brandeis.
Jukes was right.

He used me, Robert.

I was just useful to him.
My marriage was a sham.

I'm back so soon, I thought you might be taking stock.
I want my car back.
I should ban you for your own good.

Now you think throwing your car keys on the table makes you a big shot?
Nobody wants some miserable car junkie crying on their shoulder and I'm not sure I want one for a partner.
Listen, just because we're taking your dirty money, doesn't make us partners.

But you know what they say:
Never gamble more than you can afford to lose.
But that's no fun, right?

it's the risk of losing everything, that's the thrill.
Spare me the bad talk.
How about an IOU?
The debt is 600,000
No one ever walked out of this casino with an IOU.
No One.

Your mother paid your debt for you.
You can pick up your car keys at the office.
I hear your mother runs your bank now.
Hello.

Irina, you should have called.
It's a surprise.
We can't, not here.
Your face is red.

We need to cool things down.

Why?

You're the ex-wife of a possibly murdered billionaire having an affair with the chief investigator, what do you think!
Not to mention, this whole financial scandal with Jukes!
What about the girls?

So, this is it.
This is what you want.

You're a small man, Jean, in all the ways that matter.
Your Mom's kinda hot.

I mean it's not open for discussion.

I can see what my Dad sees in her.
Well, if you like her so much, go fuck her.
She slept with a girl once.

Yeah, she told me she fucked some actress when she was younger.
She told you that?

Oh, my mother barely speaks to me.
Lucky you.

So, are you going to do it?

Get with my mum.

What do you think of Dominic?
He's kind of hot.
I'm grooming him.

Can you groom someone who's older?

Do you remember that number you wrote on me?
15-07-201-4?
That was the day that Constantine and I met.
Nobody would ever know that but us.
I saw it and for a second, I thought... maybe he is still alive, maybe it's some sort of message to me.
and I remembered the man who loved me.
What sort of sick fuck uses his wife like that?
It doesn't look good but let's think about it for a moment.
None of those transactions actually implicate you.
They implicate Constantine and john Brandeis.
Maybe, he had to go into hiding... to protect himself and protect you.
but he left evidence that you weren't complicit in a place that he knew only you would find.
Georgie, maybe...

Maybe, he deserves to be... murdered by the same drug dealers and war criminals that he was helping.
But how do I know?

Well, there's one man you could ask:
John Brandeis.
Irina!

I'm here to see Ada.
Do I need an appointment?
Of course not!

Playing with the gardener and that awful girl who's always following her around.

Would you like a drink?

What is this, Saudi Arabia?

I know you don't give a shit about girls like us but I'm telling you the truth.
Ok, if you can just take a seat and...

If they see I've gone, I'm dead.

Just remember, Ameera Sayed.

This is actually a very good martini.

Thanks.
Yeah, I used to make cocktails at a bar in New York.
It was good money.
It's always good to have something to fall back on.
You must be stressed with the police investigation?
I've got nothing to hide but none of us are on firm ground.
Your marriage, through this Jukes microscope will seem very convenient.

Of course.

So, no skeletons in your closet?

It must be nice to be the innocent one.
I understand that it must be difficult for you to have another woman living in your home with your children
but there's only so many insults I can take before lunch.
Georgina, I'm sorry.
I've come to ask you a favor.
Why even bother hosting a gala?

They always used to have it here.
Constantine and I would host it together.
The children would be allowed to stay for an hour and then, they'd be taken up to bed.
You's always see them, like little birds... perched in line, at the top of the stairs, peering down.
Adam used to send down Christos to steal canapes.
Who are you thinking of inviting?
Bored people and guilty people.
Then why do you host them?
Because I'm both guilty and bored.
I can think of a few names I'd like to add to the guest list.
Anyone in particular?

John Brandeis.

No, actually but the more, the merrier.

Who is it?
I am here to see Grigory Litvinov.
He is not here.

Give us 5 minutes.
drink?
No.
Suit yourself.
So, who wants to kill me?
The girl that survived the explosion.
Do you know her?
Look around you.

Did you know that this girl attacked a nurse and killed a man who gave her a ride?
Nope.
She's either very scared of someone or she's fucking ruthless.
If she's involved in the explosion, then who's to say you are not on the same list as your father.
This all sounds like a grand fuckup on your part for not arresting her when you had the chance.
I am not going to make any more mistakes.
Hey!
Oh...
They're not both for me.
I'm entertaining, she's outside.
Look, you're welcome to join us if you're at a loose end.
You don't have to pity me, Adam.
I didn't think I was.
I'm sorry.

It's just that I've been feeling more and more like a widow these days and not much else.
I don't like it.
You know, you learn so much more about people after they're dead than when they were alive.
I'll let you get back to...
Natasha.
Well, um, you're welcome to join us.

It does no good sitting here on your own, dwelling on things.
Trust me.
Sun, gin, swim...

Thank you, no.

Alright.
I could never pity you, Georgina.
She's new.
What happened to the last one?
Who could remember?
Hello!

We have a vault with you.

Well, in light of his recent passing, I'm going to need to come down and review the collection
Ok, so what do I need to bring again?
I'll bring some ID, a copy of my passport, marriage license, our certificate of incorporation.
Yes, yes, I've got all that.

How does first thing tomorrow morning sound?
Great.

English?

What's your name?

Do you want to party?
Yeah.
Please stop.

I'm just here to talk.
You want me to talk dirty?

I'm a policeman.
I saw you at the Police Station this morning.
The girl you're looking for, is she still missing?
Yes, my sister.
Do you recognize her?
No, I'm sorry.
She may be in danger, too.
If you help me find my sister, I can ask the girls.
Maybe one of them knows her.
Wouldn't that get you in trouble?

My sister... she was sent to a private party last weekend and never came back.
Ok, I'll see what I can find out.
Where was the party?

Do you have a picture of her?

Just take a good look at me.

Hello?

Why don't you put that thing down.

You were meant to give me more time.
These things happen.

Why are you acting so rattled?

Put it down.
What were you thinking?

Wait!

Elena is still out there.

I heard them talkin'
Who?

Only half of it was destroyed.

I think it's in the house.
I'm the one who fucked it.

Make sure that you do.

Alright.
What the fuck is that?

Just a little tracker, you know... it would be terrible if me and you were to lose each other.
It's like Fort Knox in here.

Mrs. Clios...
I will check you in, if the computer permits it.
And it finally does.
Welcome.

Executive Assistant, actually.
This way, please.
Art work that doesn't leave the free port is exempt from all tax and Customs duties.
Art sales conducted within these walls can also be considered tax-free
Due to this, we hold many of the most expensive paintings in the world.
You probably witnessed their sales at
New York and London's most prestigious auction houses.
I have probably bid on them.

The sale merely involves the movement of canvas from one boat to the next.
It is almost comical.
If not a little bit tragic.

Like most things, it depends on one's perspective.
This is the Clios vault now.
I'll leave you here, so you can view in privacy.
Discretion is our modus operandi.

Thank you.
There's not much in here.
Georgie, this looks like the real deal.

They belong to John Brandeis.
I should know, I sold them to him
Well, what are they doing locked in a vault belonging to Constantine?
What's this?
The details of a bank account.

His passport.

Piazza Grande, from a lottery booth across the border.
Christos Clios, what are you doing here?
I heard you were in town.
The rumor has it, you hate Monaco.
A rumor is a circulated story of questionable truth.
My disdain for Monaco is fact.
I do my utmost to remind people of it at every juncture.
Could we talk in private?

I'm so sorry, your father...

It's fine.

Do they know what happened?

It's been difficult.
Lawyers, litigation, freeing up my father's estate...
That's why I'm here.

The Clios collection is coveted.

And even for these vulgarians, 400 million is not a steal
Let's not be too stuck on the collection as a whole.
Will Georgina not be upset?

No, she and I would accept offers on single items, be reasonable.
Reasonable?
Make some sales.
We need to sell some paintings and let's keep this between us.
I don't want to create too much noise and start a frenzy.
This is the girl we found by the train station.
What is it you found there?
Put this on.

We're leaving.

You found her, didn't you?
We have to get you out of here first, then we can discuss this somewhere safe.
Oh, my God!
No, you need to tell me.
They found her next to the train station.
She had overdosed.

But she didn't even use.
She didn't take anything, even when they said it would help.
She was the strong one.

We have to get you out of here before they do the same thing to you.
Let them.

Listen, if you want me to catch the man who did this to your sister, you must come with me now.
Hello.
I'm fine.
Now?

I don't like surprises.
Let's do this to all threatening to pull out of the Clios Bank.
Luckily for us, he's got a wife and kids and my guess is, he wants to keep it that way.
So...

Go.
Now. look there.

Now, this is my favorite bit.
So, do I get a kiss?
Maybe.

Alright.
When do we pay him a visit?

Oh!

Hello?
Who am I?
Just a helpful friend.
They have frozen my personal account as well as the business account.
How the fuck am I supposed to live?
Well, I can lend you a card.

I want my fucking life back!
I think, with the way you're acting at the moment, not having access to money might not be such a bad idea.
You come here to lecture me, just...
What?
A friend of mine discovered an awkward situation with one of your investors.
And?
Fortunately, this friend spoke to this investor and reassured him that because he's a business associate of yours,
this little indiscretion would be forgotten.
As long as he's in business with me, he's sake.
Something along those lines.
Is that a smile?
I've not seen you smile for a while.
So, once all this has blown over... we won't need Negrescu's account anymore.
Why do you think the investor changed his mind?
Sorry.
Georgina!

If it's not a bad time, I thought maybe we could go for a drink.
Um, it's not actually a good time.

Yeah, yeah, of course
I just...
Adam, are you there?

Sorry, um, don't worry.
I'll see you later.
Doesn't look like the kind of place a billionaire would call home.
He must have left this ticket for a reason.
Maybe he won.
Maybe it's a winning ticket and he was too embarrassed to collect it.
I am not embarrassed.
Monsieur...
A wish for winning, I hope you win.
No winner.
Keep it, this little thing will bring you good luck.
I think that means no.
You know, it could have been worse.

You could have had children.
Maybe I was wrong, Georgie.
Maybe there was no message, after all.
I found him.
I found John Brandeis
My love, you know I trust you implicitly.
You know how bad I actually...
Everything I have is yours.
Hidden in plain sight.
Georgina, I love you and I always will.
Was it love?

Sparking fires, sparring wars with expensive things
I tiptoe right round my baby All this world is mad, mad crazy
