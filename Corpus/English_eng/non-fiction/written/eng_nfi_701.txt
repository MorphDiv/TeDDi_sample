- Lawrence.

Try to cheer up.

I do.

There's a reason we haven't talked in years.
- But here I am.

I thought I'd buried it, but here you...
I heard what happened to your baby.

I don't want to talk about that.

You need to make a change.

London's waiting.
- I can't come to England.

I've run away before.

How do I look?
Like a pregnant schoolgirl.
She loves him.
But does he love her?
I think he might actually propose today.
Alan's a crazy romantic like that.
- You silly little bitch!

What are you playing at, putting letters in my mailbox?
What if my wife found it?
You ever think what that would do to me?
I can't stop thinking about our life together.
You and me, on our own.
You mean it, don't you?
Do I look like I'm joking?
Close your eyes.
VIV: $450, a whole year's pay.
- Itchy feet?

Joan Millar, hello again.
Aren't you supposed to be in Singapore?
I had a revelation in the taxi.
Wherever you are, that's where I'll be.
(TRAFFIC NOISE)
I can't believe you convinced the board.
What exactly are you called again?
Visiting OG consultant.
And there was no talking them into it.
They were, as expected, delighted to have me.
As I am equally delighted to have a few more weeks to persuade you to come to London with me.
Not like that.

What's that word when you mishit a golf ball?
- Fore.

Foreplay is not a golfing term.
Mm-hm.

- You are supposed to be helping me.

- (DOOR OPENS)

You ruined my putt.
As long as that's all I ruined.
New admissions files?
You did say I could park myself here.
Yeah.
- May I?

Thank you.
So, you're hanging around?
You know... sunshine and all that.
(CLINK!

How was that?
Don't look so worried.

You know, if we weren't here,
Matron would have to pay someone to do this.
And then she'd run out of money and her entire empire would collapse.
Oh, god, it's him.

Not now.
- Who's that?

Who's that with him?
- His wife.

Wow!

We're happy to help.
Yes, we are.

And, uh, the other matter?
You don't need to worry about a thing.
Everything is in order and under control.
You didn't tell us he was married.
Because I knew you wouldn't be sophisticated enough to get it.
But he has a wife.
Elena, you don't understand.
It's a marriage of convenience, okay?
He's being forced to stay in it because his wife is sick.
- She didn't look sick.

- Is that why they're here?

She's really sick, so she has to have a bunch of tests so they can cure her, so then Alan can be with me.
- Do I look all right?

Debbie... if he loves you, why can't you both keep the baby?
Because we're going to Paris.
As if we'd take a baby there.
You're not even trying to understand!
You need to work on your stroke.
Thanks.

Yeah, I saw.

Seems to think he knows what's best for you.
See, I told your Dr Patterson was on rounds this morning.
It's a bit desperate when the only way to see an old friend is by having a baby.
Jennifer.
Good to see you.
Andrew was my husband's best friend.
John died in Vietnam.
I'm so sorry...
No, at least I've still got part of him here with me.
And you said you'd deliver our baby, so, here I am.
Let's take a look at you.
A really spunky man and an average-looking woman.
Did he have a brown jacket?
Yeah, and blue flares.
I did see a couple talking to Matron.
Why would they be talking to Matron?
What was Alan doing here?
The Fitzgeralds, why would they want to see you?
Who I see or don't see has absolutely nothing to do with you.
No, you have to tell me.
Believe it or not, the day I take orders from you has not yet arrived.
Alan!
Alan!
- You have to talk to me!

(SCOFFS)
Right.
You and Jennifer's husband...
- must have been tough.

You were his... best man?
Yeah.

(DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS)
Your BP's still high.
How high?
I'll order some Diazoxide.

(EXHALES)
Don't worry.

Is Andrew still around?
I'll let him know you want to see him.
He and John were best friends through med school.
John, I fell in love with instantly, but...
Andrew, I took a little while to warm to.
He can be a bit... um...
Arrogant?
But he was always there for me and John.

(DOOR CLICKS)
- ALAN:

VIV:

She might retire.
It's not only Matron.
I want to get away, see the world and have an adventure.
- Where would you go?

Anywhere they need nurses,
New York or Paris or London.
I should keep moving.
Just say the word.

You would do that?

I'm happy to.
St Albert's would be great for you.
My son was born there.
Thank you, Dr Faber.
Not at all.
What are you up to?
Hatching a plan.
Move all your friends to London.
- You never give up, do you?

That's what you like about me.
Well, one of the things, anyway.
- Lawrence, don't.

- Everyone knows I'm crazy about you.

Dr Millar, I've been having a think about where to place a new humidicrib.
I found another very generous patron.
That's wonderful.
Excuse me.
Still working on your plan to whisk Dr Millar away, I see.
Give me time.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)
(DOOR OPENS)
Yes?
You don't know me but I'm Alan's girlfriend.
I know who you are.
But he hasn't been able to tell you because of your illness.
I'm not ill.
Well, anyway, he wants to be with me, not you.
- Is that what he told you?

- We're going to Paris.

I won't be a minute.

These are yours.
You should have them back.
Don't think we have anything else to say, do you?
The first thing I noticed about you was that smile.
Across a crowded room at the annual hospital ball.
- The band were playing.

- (CHUCKLES) They were.

But do you remember the song?
♪ I don't know what it is that makes me love you so... ♪
Oh my god.
♪ I only know I never want to let you go... ♪
Are you kidding me?
♪ 'Cause you started something Oh, can't you see... ♪
This is the song.
You did this.
Joan Millar...

You wouldn't really move to London, would you?
I missed the swinging '60s and it's already 1972.
I think if I don't go over there soon, I'll be 40 and nearly dead.
(LAUGHS)
I reckon Joan would move over there.
Her and Lawrence are kinda perfect, aren't they?
Yeah... kind of.
Did you know he's got a son?
LAWRENCE:

All right, Dominic.
Daddy's gotta go.

Bye, darling.

Koalas are not bears.
Try telling that to a two-year old.
You know, working together...

We get to do it in the theatre... in the ward.
Not the morgue.
Course not.

Actually... not at work anywhere.
Worried about sleeping with the boss, eh?
I did that already.
Didn't work out, remember?
I'll tell you what... let's just focus on bossing each other around.
Starting with this.
- I need your help.

Relax, Church Mouse, it'll only take a minute.
Nothing ever takes a minute with you.
If Matron ever finds out I've done this...
Just open it.
- Rita.

- Are you okay?

Um... yeah.
What's going on?
What on earth are you doing?
This is about me.
About the adoption, but I don't understand.
This part here.
Your baby's already been adopted.
It's the Fitzgeralds, isn't it?
I'm not reading it wrong?
Alan and Barbara Fitzgerald.
I'm sure they're lovely people.
(SOLEMN MUSIC)
(GROANS) I wish John was here.
Of course you do.
(GROANS, BREATHES DEEPLY)
Let's try a second dose of the Diazoxide.
(GROANS, GASPS)
I'll be back.
If we can't get the BP down soon, we may need to do a C-section.
It's looking dangerous.
Proteinuria or oedema?
Not yet, but I don't want to risk it.
Sounds like you've got it under control.
Actually, no.
Because what she wants right now is emotional reassurance.
And she doesn't want it from me.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Jennifer... we may have to do a caesarean.
Are you prepared for that?
Just promise me you'll do whatever's best for the baby.
It doesn't matter about me.
Give it another half hour.

He used me.

Stupid Eiffel Tower!
I never wanted to go to any of these dumb places!
I never wanted to go to France.

Maybe it's not what you think.
That form might have meant something different.
I'm not an idiot.
I hate him. (SOBS)
I hate him so much!
Maybe if you talk to Matron, she might change...
I hate Matron!
And I hate Alan's stupid cow of a wife!
And there's no way she's getting this baby!
(TRAFFIC NOISE)
JOAN:

No, too high.

I can't lose this baby.
It's all I have left of John. (GASPS)
You'll be in safe hands with Dr Millar.
Andrew... (GASPS)
I can be scrubbed up in two minutes.
- (KNOCK AT DOOR)

How did it go?
A healthy baby boy.
Only slightly underweight.
Jennifer's in recovery.

- BP's going down.

Whatever's happened between you two, you need to deal with it.
You can't bring it into the operating theatre.
- Yeah, I'll bear that in mind.

I'm your friend and I want to help you but I can't if I don't know what's going on.
There is nothing more to know.
Other than I killed her husband.
It was meant to be me.
I was supposed to go out in the chopper but I'd had a rough night.
36 hours operating straight.
John volunteered to go out instead.
And 20 minutes later the chopper crashed.
It wasn't your fault.
You didn't kill him.
Despite what everyone says...
I still blame myself for Laura.
Blaming myself isn't going to bring her back.
And blaming yourself... isn't going to help Jennifer, either.
I was wondering where you got to.
Head clearing.
In case Joan hasn't mentioned it, the op went well.
Delivery completed in 10 minutes.
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
Any time you have concerns about your competency, I'm here.
I'm happy to help.
(SCOFFS)
Excuse me.
What?
Why have you already adopted out Debbie's baby?
So it was you who ransacked my office?
I don't know anything about that.

I'm not prepared to discuss placements.
They're confidential, as you well know.
This is the man who got her pregnant.
Where babies go is none of your business, Nurse Maguire.
And I'll remind you to know your place.
How is it that you're so well-informed on this particular matter?
Nurses talk, hear things.
I'm sure they do.
(SNIGGERS) Matron can go jump.

I hate her.

- And I hate this baby.

I hate it so much I wish it were dead!
Debbie, please, come down from there.
- Bugger off!

All of you, bugger off!

Give it to me and put out the cigarette.
- Go away!

- (LAUGHS)

Am I, Miss Holier Than Thou?
And what would you know about love anyway?
You'll hurt yourself and the baby jumping like that.
I don't care!
(SOBS) Do you know what I'm going to do.
I'm gonna set this whole place on fire.
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, no, Debbie...
Quick, go get help.
(GASPS)
Oh, no. (GASPS)
Matron, can I stay with her?
- Absolutely not.

Short time only.
Bleeding has eased but it hasn't stopped.
I suspect a placental abruption from abdominal trauma.
They're stealing my baby.
Who is?
Can you get on to Andrew and Lawrence too?
There's some PV bleeding we need to discuss.
Is she going to be all right?
You know you caused this, farming Debbie's baby out to her married lover.
Classy.
Believe what you will.
The girl's welfare is of concern to me.
Provided it suits your agenda.
Debbie is in labour.

If it turns into a large abruption, we may have to do a hysterectomy.
(SOBS) Nobody told me it would be this bad.
(SOBS) It hurts.
I know.
But we can't do anything about that until we get all your tests done.
(GROANS)
In the meantime, I need you to make a decision.
- As if anyone cares what I want.

We can go two ways.
If your alcohol levels aren't too high and everything's fine there, we can probably do a natural delivery.
If not, we may have to do a caesarean.
No, no, no, you can't can cut me open.
I don't want any scars.
I don't want to see it and be reminded of it.
I don't want anyone to know I've had it.

- Okay?

If there's any way you can have a natural delivery...
I'll do my best to make that happen.
Okay.
(SIGHS, MOANS)
(RELAXING MUSIC)
Foetal heart rate is good before and after contractions.
So we're just waiting on the ultrasound.
This is Dr Millar, Debbie's obstetrician.
I'm sorry, it's not visiting hours yet.
This is Mr and Mrs Fitzgerald.
They want to be here when the baby arrives.
That may not be for a while yet.
But a caesarean doesn't take very long, does it?
No, no at all.

We haven't made that decision yet.
Can I have a word?
Get them out.
I don't care where they go.

At this stage, there's no need for medical intervention.
If the placenta separates further during labour you're gonna have to caesar her anyway.
Get it over with.

Debbie's been very clear about not wanting a scar.
She doesn't want any physical evidence of the pregnancy.
Yeah, but patients don't run the hospital.
Yeah, and neither do you.
Because last time I checked, I'm still head of obstetrics.
What I say goes.
So, back off.
Can't you get me an injection or something?
- I'm not allowed.

Maybe if we took your mind off it, like,
I don't know, you could start teaching me calculus.
That's the dumbest thing you've ever said!
Aarggh!

- Elena's here.

- I brought you a present.

(GROANS)
(GROANS, SOBS)
ALAN: (IN DISTANCE) I think you should operate.
JOAN:

- Is that Alan?

I heard his voice.

- I don't think so.

Good news.
The ultrasound showed small blood loss, so it's unlikely to be an abruption.
Unless it's absolutely necessary, we won't do a C-section.
And it won't affect you having a family in the future.
I don't care!

Why can't they do a caesarean?

- Is that all you care about?

What about Debbie?

I was thinking about the baby's welfare.
Someone has to, because clearly that girl isn't.
- That's right.

Mr Creep who had sex with a schoolgirl and got her pregnant?
Whose welfare were you thinking about when you did that?
That's enough!

That's no problem.

Oh, dear, I'm so, so sorry.
Perhaps you'd be more comfortable in my office?
♪ Come and lay down by my side... ♪
(SOBS) I can't do it!

Yes, you can, Debbie.
You are doing really well.
Baby's crowning.
You don't need to push anymore, Debbie, just pant.
- (PANTS)

And you don't need to do any more.
- The babies will do the rest.

It's coming now.

No, keep it up.

(SIGHS)
You did it?
I did.
Hey, little man.
I hope he's got big feet.
Your dad left you some really big boots to fill.
You coming here took me by surprise.
I coul...

I wasn't ready.
I'm sorry.
And when you stopped returning my calls, I...
Yeah...

No, no, I...

Honestly, I was kind of relieved.
Every time we talked,
I felt like I could almost feel your pain through the phone.
And it made mine...
Well...
It made mine unbearable.
And now I've got this beautiful baby who's never gonna know who his daddy was.
But at least we can give him our memories.
That's what godfathers are for.
Are you sure?
You do remember what a bad influence I am?
I do.
And that's exactly what he's going to need.
Vivian, a word, please.
Yes, Matron?
Your behaviour today was unforgivable.
- And as for the way...

Don't even bother to reprimand me because as of right now...
I quit!
I quit!
Here you go.
Are you all right, Matron?
Of course.
These should have been dealt with by now.
Yes, Matron.
Rita.
You did quite well today.
I feel a bit light-headed.

What are you gonna do?
I have no idea.
But I know I have to go.
You know what I've been afraid of, that if I stay here too long,
I become one of those people that just never tries anything new.
Like Matron?
The only person I want to become is myself.
(LOW-LEVEL CONVERSATIONS)
LAWRENCE:

I'm tired.
It's more than that.
- Maybe.

Definitely.
Sounds ominous.
I think you should go back to London.
- This is about Andrew, isn't it?

It has nothing to do with him.
Then what?
I love you, Lawrence.
But...
Not enough.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Joan Millar.

The last Stanton House girl with me to go.
That is why... wherever we are, we will be connected forever.
Hey, Viv, you'll have to show those bloody Poms how us Aussies drink, eh?

Sorry, Viv, Matron sends her apologies.
She really wished she could be here.
Yeah, right.
