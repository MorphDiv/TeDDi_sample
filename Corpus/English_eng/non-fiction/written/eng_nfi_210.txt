Speed it up, will you?
You drive like my granny.
We're moving with the flow of traffic.
When do I get to drive?
My car, so, never.
Ooh, I'm gonna sign in this thing called Twitter.
You put up what you're thinking like, "I love pizza,"
or "I'm having pizza now", or even "pizza is awesome."
All your thoughts don't have to be pizza related.
Says who?
Hey, I could order a pizza, while we're puttering along here.
Ooh, great idea.
Gonna have pizza soon.
First twit sent.
What the heck is that?
- Flash, go find out.

- Report.

I'm not totally sure.
Big week for us.

They were so pissed.
"You'll pay for interfering with us."
Blah, blah, blah.
And now we get to stop an alien brawl.
Which side do we join?
- Really?

Titans, go!
And the fact that she's hot has nothing to do with it.
Buzz off, lizard lips!
Coming through.

Excusez-moi
I think Rapunzel is trying to tell us something.
Speedy, you got something loud to close that thing?
Got you covered, boss.
Whoa!
I did not see that coming.
Thank you.
I am Koriand'r of Tamaran.
Our kind can learn language from the act of kissing.
Useful.
Are you all right?
My sister, Komand'r, staged a coup and took the throne.
I had to flee.
But I will soon return.
Well, you can stay with us until you figure it out.
Okay?
Yes, please.
I will ask sanctuary for two or three days.
A week at the longest.
Let me introduce you to my friends.
Oh, by the way, I speak some Spanish, if you wanna learn that.
Second year high school French.
Welcome to the Teen Titans.
Careful, you fool.
This equipment is worth more than your lives.
What?
The Titans will be there in less than a minute.
I see no signs of that.
Believe, don't believe, your choice.
They're ready.
They're slow.
I hardly had time to answer a post.
It's a tough climb, especially in this moonlight.
Nightwing.
They're bound to spot us.
Nightwing.
If we wait for those clouds...
Dick!
What?
Terra is taking us up there.
She is?
Yeah, I do all the dirty work around here.
Going up.
You've been gone a long time, cowboy.
Let's move.
Quiet down.
The bug is nervous.
I'm not feeling too good about this myself.
How come you're so calm?
You have never been a gopher.
Hey!
Scarab, stop.
Control that thing, Beetle, or I'll control it for you.
You're going to have a sword fight in here?
How about some place roomier like a broom closet?
Everyone, calm down.
The enemy is above us.
You have to channel all your thoughts to that.
Remember, these opponents are different.
Uh, as Kori will tell you.
No, keep going.
I've been studying them since I left the Titans.
They're zealots, extremists.
They'll sacrifice themselves without hesitation to get to you.
So, the quicker we take them down, the better.
That about cover it?
Very well said.
Terra, can you do this?
Yes, if you'd all shut up.
We're six inches under the floor.
Who wants to knock?
Titans, go!
"Thanks for getting us into the impenetrable H.I.V.E base, Terra."
"Yeah, you're the best."
This bad guy is yours, mama.
Terra, stay with us.
Like I couldn't take out all these jokers by myself.
We've been compromised.
Abandon the base.
They prepared well.
Their reaction time is much better.
Robin, stop complementing the bad guys.
But he's right.

These dudes must buy their bad guy stuff in bulk.
How about we do that move you taught me last weekend?
Now?
I admire your boldness, but what will the team think?
What?

Okay, you got me.
The training move, please.
Get in the truck.
Your service has come to an end.
Bless you all.
Watch it, dude.

At least act like you're trying to keep your parasite in line, Beetle.
That was unbearable.
Get it?
Seriously?
Could you not leave yourself open like that?
I worry.
I'm sorry, babe.
I've been doing a lot of thinking lately.
About what?
I think we should take the next step in our relationship.
To be continued.
Say cheese, and post.
Hey, how about a movie tonight?
Whoa!
Keep moving, Magilla.
The base is ours.
So, what were you saying before we were interrupted?
I...
Okay, good a place as any.
I got an apartment in the city.
I hoped, maybe, we could share, you know, together.
Oh, snap!
No rock?
That's so lame.
On Tamaran, everyone would gossip.
So it's a good thing we live here.
What I'm getting is that they're too good to hang with us.
Yeah, that's the takeaway.
Hey, I'm over a million followers!
Call me Jefe.
You need to get your head in the game, Gar.
Or, maybe your head is in a different game.
Who wouldn't want to date me?

But everything I do pisses her off.
Want my advice?
Quit turning into a chimp and stealing monkey kisses.
People think that's adorable.
Nope, no one thinks that.
Time out.
Gotta make a call.
Terra.
Would you like to join me?
The staff helps clear the mind.
No thanks.
I'm just trying to avoid green bean for a while.
I never cared much for the zoo.
If he's bothering you...
He's just a jerk.
Is it true what they say about her, that she has her father trapped in that Jewel on her head?
Yes, his name is Trigon.
He's a demon.
They have issues.
Well, she knows where she can find him.
You should talk to her more.
You'll find that Raven can be quite interesting.
No thanks.

Sounds like a good time, Milagro.
Did you get my gift?
Sure did.

Mom and dad wanna say hi.

There's my baby boy!
Are you getting enough to eat?
Yeah, how's it goin'?
Still doesn't like me, huh?
It's getting better.
Let's not talk about that thing.
It's been two years.
I'm working on it, dad.
But it's hard, you know.
It's got a mind of its own.
- And a temper.

For god's sake.

You think Superman or someone could take that thing off him.
You're supposed to calm down.
We can't have every call end this way, Aldo.
Jaime won't wanna talk to us.
Why is the cake coming out?

Ah, your aunt, Consuela, esta loca.
Go, mom, we can talk later.
I love you, Jaime.
Be good.
Consuela, give me that cake!
I better go too.
I'm sorry.

I miss my son.
Accessing most recent footage on brother Blood.
Lies.
My church is a holy place and we strive only to do good.
Come now, brother Blood.
Isn't your church just a glorified cult?
Unlike you, Bryce, I believe in an America where all beliefs should be treated with respect.
It's a shame the press doesn't.
I'm afraid that's all we're going to get from brother Blood.
I'm Bryce Peterson.
Have a good night.
Grandfather would have been impressed with blood, running a worldwide cult as well as H.I.V.E.
They're the same thing.
He just makes them look separate.
Do you ever get out of that uniform?
Only when I bathe.
Might be time.
I'm good.
Goin' out.
I hear you're gone a lot.
Where do you go?
You realize I'm not a child who needs permission to go outside.
Correct?
Damien, I wasn't interrogating.
Just taking an interest.
Oh!
I go out on patrol.
By the way, I should offer congratulations on your cohabitation, Grayson.
Starfire has proven herself to be a decent leader.
I approve.
Thank you.
Have you found anything in the H.I.V.E. Files?
Nothing Earth-shaking, but I'm still checking.
Sounds like you got squat.
I love endangering my life for nothing.
Which is why I've added the newest files to the ones too damaged to read, from the previous raids.
I'm hoping the computer will find a connection we missed.
It may take the program a day or two.
Not your worst idea.
What?
Ugh!
Hey, anyone seen Jaime?
Yeah, he's right there.
Something is wrong.
Yeah, there is.

You wanna come see?
Buzz off.
Maybe you should go.
Might be good to have two of you down there.
And I say to you.

Sinners and blasphemers who do not share our values need not apply, brothers and sisters.
Hail, brother Blood!
Hail, hail, hail.
Hail, brother Blood.
Hail, hail, hail...
Ah, there you are, Mayhem.
Punctual as always.
How can you be so calm?
That was the third base the Titans have destroyed.
My plan is nine centuries in the making.
In every age, there are always those who oppose me.
But as you can see,
I am always victorious.
Is that the reporter?
Yes.
Our friend won't be asking impertinent questions anymore.
His heresy does not compare to the titan's threat.
We barely escaped them.
But you did, because he warned you.
Our guardian angel.
Oh, stop your fretting, Mayhem.
He'll keep the Titans at bay.
I've foreseen it.
Plus, I pay the bastard enough.
Could you slow down, Jaime?
Go back to the tower then.
Nobody asked you to come.
Oh, come on.

I'm not.
What I mean is, I respect Jaime not wanting to talk.
In fact, more people should learn to shut their mouths.
Well, that's no fun.
Uh, okay, I give up.
The center.
My parents volunteer for the one in my town.
And...
Maybe I should volunteer.
Yeah, right.
We're Titans.
We don't serve soup.
You don't have to move a mountain to help people, Terra.
Besides, I gotta find a way to make the bug more comfortable around humans.
Can I help you?
Yes, um,
Traci.
I was wondering who I can speak to about volunteering?
That would be me.
And there it is.
Just because we have powers doesn't mean we can't, you know, have relationships.
Don't you think?
Hey, there's nothing wrong with having a life, right?
Kill her!
Kill the demon!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
This is lame.

For nearly a millennium, I have bathed in my enemy's blood, and for some mysterious reason, it has provided me immortality.
I have often wondered why?
Why me?
But now I know.
It was meant to bring me to this age, this place, this moment, where technology can at last be made to serve my greatness.
Proceed.
You've done well.
Advance the preparations, Mayhem.

Your service has come to an end.
Bless you, my son.
For a space Princess, you sure have a lot of stuff.
I've had this since I was a little girl.
It was the only thing I had time to take.
Not again.
Terra, are you okay?
She's going to bring the building down.
I can help.
What are you doing?
Get off me!
You were shaking everything, Terra.
We came to check on you.
Are you all right?
It's a freaking nightmare.
Just leave me alone.
I'm okay, so, get going.
You heard me.

You too, greeny.
Does that happen a lot?
It happens enough.
- What did you see?

And if I did see anything, it wouldn't be your business.
Everything that goes on in the tower is my business.
Just like it should be for all of you.
The last I checked, Damien, Kori was in charge, not you.
So good to see you again, my friends.
It's been too long.
Too long.
Don't make this weirder than it already is, blood.
Are you referring to the setting?
I myself take strength from it.
The cemetery isn't a place to be feared.
It's a place of renewal.
I have no problem meeting anywhere you want, but I get concerned when my employer talks to himself.
I talk to the dead, for no matter how rotted the corpse, there's always a tiny wisp of life left.
Sometimes enough life to bring them back.
You of all people should know that.
What do you want, blood?
I want to move everything up by a week.
I've waited long enough, Deathstroke.
That wasn't the deal.
I'll double your price.
Is that acceptable?
As before, I want all the Titans.
Can you do it?
To be ready for anything, you must train for everything.
That was the most important lesson instilled in me by the warlords of Okaara.
Them again?
Dude...
And so it shall be instilled in you.
Let's pair off.
Those not fighting, watch and learn.
Nightwing.
Shall we dance, good sir?
But of course, my lady.
Guess we know who's taking out the garbage at the new place.
That was not a confidence booster.
You did very well.
You lasted far longer this time.
I meant in training, of course.
He's very proficient when we have...
Kori!
Blue Beetle, Raven.
Sorry, Raven, the bug doesn't wanna lose.
And you do?
Dios mio!

What the hell are you doing?
Ah, I'm fine.
But dad feels I've disgraced myself.
So that's nice.
Beast Boy, Terra, you ready?
Right.

I'll take it easy on Terra.
I'm gonna enjoy shutting you up.
Only if you catch me, mama.
Mon Cherie, let Garfield give you a big hug.
Mmm, so soft.
I let you go for a little kiss.
Kill her!
Now, witch, you get what's coming to you!
Who you calling a witch?
Terra!
She's going to kill him!
Argh!
Terra, control yourself!
What?
What's going on?
I'm sorry, it's not my fault.
- Let me calm your mind.

- Don't touch me.

Take a breath.
We're here for you.
Yeah.

What's wrong with you people?
I know what you're going to say.

No, it's something else.
She knows.
Since we talked, I have sensed something off about Terra.
She needs to be watched, Grayson.
She needs understanding not surveillance.
Terra, has her rough edges.

And I agree.
Making decisions with your heart will get people killed.
It's not like I can't sense the vibrations of someone following me.
Even if they are on a roof.
I know what it's like not to fit in with the group.
What's wrong?
Aside from monkey boy making me melt down, or Raven staring all the time,
Nightwing, acting like a den mother, Jaime and his freako bug, miss smiles-a-lot, and you, my new stalker, huh, nothing I guess.
If you need to talk let us help you.
Such an observant, considerate boy.
You would think he truly cares.
Slade?

Stay back.
Let me guess, they got you to a Lazarus pit, just in time.
Yes, I've been bathing in it quite a bit, lately.
You might say, it's addictive.
Improves muscle tone too.
Losing your edge.
Your friends have made you soft.
Like I said, soft.
Took you long enough.
You betrayed us, why?
Betrayed?
That assumes I was ever on your side in the first place.
There you go, Mr. Fernandez.
- Great to have your help.

Thank you.
I kinda needed this.
This just reminds me of home.
- Ow!

You don't wanna get burned.
Do you hear that?
- I heard it before.

I hope there's not a short.
I think I heard it move over there.
I know my pulse is racing.
But I'm in no danger.

Defensive measures are not needed.

There's something humans call sexual attraction.
Aye, my life.
Uh, Jaime?
What are you doing?
I thought I'd get more comfortable.
Don't.
You can't run over here at the first sign of trouble.
I was losing it.

Luckily taking Robin out works.
Grabs a handful.
Best to get him out of the way.
He was suspicious.
Always is.
Didn't say he was stupid.
He damaged the camera lens.
Greenie was asking for it.
It's taken a year to get the information I need to defeat theTitans.
Could've ruined everything.

- Kill her!

Kill the witch!

Kill her now!
Leave or die.

Terra Markov?
I heard you're a special girl.
Is that true?
My name is Slade.
Looks like I got it.
Not yet, you haven't.
But you could.
- We discussed this.

- You said we'd be together.

The contract is everything.
We need total concentration for it.
You know it's taken a lot of work to get here.
- Especially by you.

The Titans are always acting like they care so much.
It messes with my head.
Just a little longer, Terra.
With the money from blood we'll form our own league of assassins.
You and I.
Together in every way.
I didn't see you bringing quite so many weapons to our new place.
- If you don't like them...

Is something up?
After the incident at the training field you met with members of the team without me.
Yeah, we talked.

Kori, you know I'd never undermine you, right?
They went to you.
You were...

So, they instinctively look to you, now that you're back.
After all, I'm not even from your world.
Hey.

You were chosen by the team to lead them.
And have I told you how glad I am that you've chosen to move in with me?
At least I was your first choice for that.
Yeah.

You brat.
Damian!

Perfect timing.
- Solo?

Have I mentioned he approves of us?
So do I.
Yeah?

Not yet.
Nice visit.
I know I'm not easy to get close to.
We have that in common, I think.
But I could teach you some meditation techniques.
It might help you stay in control.
Maybe.

The other reason I'm here is to tell you the team's assembling in the common room.
I need a minute.

They know about Robin.
They don't.
Raven, being nice?
And there's nothing scheduled.
They know I'm working with you.
If they knew, she wouldn't have come alone.
Unless they wanted to get my guard down.
I don't think I can take them all if they're ready.
Calm yourself.

Use that.
Surprise!
Shit.
You guys scared me.
We can see that.
- Are those for me?

For your one year anniversary as a member of the Titans.
- It was all Raven's idea.

No one has ever done anything like this for me.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Dry those tears and let's get this party started, mama!
The computer's done.
- The one with blood's files.

File reconstruction and integration complete.
That scientist used to work for H.I.V.E.
Body never recovered.
Seems his personal lab is still being paid for by one of blood's holding companies.
The Titans should look into this.
Beast Boy's sending you pictures of Terra's party.
Shame you're missing it.
You should go.

I'm not gonna let you bait me, kid.
Oh, what the hell.
Big man.
Why not get me out of here so I can defend myself properly?
- Unless, you're afraid.

You're down to hoping I'm gonna act like the biggest stooge in a b-movie?
Your outfit said "give it a shot."
Grandson of the demon's head, you are not.
You're an entitled brat.
I Rose from nothing while you had everything handed to you.
You cost me my rightful place.
And the family you betrayed.
They turned on me by choosing you.
You took my old family, Damian.
So I'll take your new one.
I should reply.
"I am well and will see you soon."
You're more of a dick.
"Undercover.

Shame I don't have more time to break you down.
Inside a month, I'd have you bringing me my pipe and calling me papa.
Slade?

- You seeing this?

We leave in five minutes.
Be a good boy.
Careful.

Any idea what that gizmo is?
Nothing good.
He's deleting.

That makes two of us.
Okay, three.
Step away from the computer.

Go after him.

We should have stayed at the party.
Quit complaining.
Uh-oh!
Oh, you wanna play?
That's it?

What do you want to ask him first?
Bad luck for him.
At least it wasn't one of us.
Yes, bad luck.
That we couldn't speak with him about these.
Maybe he was a fan?
Is it really a surprise they would study us?
We've been defeating them for months.
And you were after them even before that.
But this stuff is so in-depth.
Things on genetic makeup.
Theories on Raven's power.
Beast Boy's too.
And Beetle's suit.
What's it for?
We need to get Robin back here.
You know how stubborn he can be.
He's a titan.

Nothing like laser-spewing H.I.V.E drones to take you out of a party mood.
I'm beat and I'm making lunch at the center tomorrow.
In more exciting news,
I've been invited to be on Kevin Smith's podcast at Metrocon tomorrow.
Hold up, Starfire's got something to say.
With what we discovered tonight, we all need to be extra vigilant and not take any chances.
Are you kidding me?

I didn't say don't do what you have planned.
But keep your eyes and comm lines open at all times.
I have a feeling whatever blood is planning tonight is just a prelude.
Sorry your party was interrupted.
That's the way it goes.
Don't let all that talk back there shake you up.
You know I got your back.
It's other stuff.
Like what?
I'm all ears.
You've a pretty smile.
Do you know how I became an orphan?
Uh, your parents died?
No.
After I got powers, they freaked.
Thought I was possessed or something.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
I don't need your pity.
It can be a bond, you know?
Everyone on the team's had it rough.
Yeah.
I can tell Princess sparkle thong knows all about eating from a dumpster.
Kori is a refugee being stalked by her homicidal sister.
Jaime has a family that loves him.
And, because of the bug, odds are he's never seeing them face-to-face again.
I think pain is what makes a hero.
It's like a pressure that either forms a diamond or grinds you into dust.
But what about you, chuckles?
Aside from an unhealthy online presence, you're normal.
Yeah, you're green.
You wouldn't change it if you could.
You like the attention.
Besides it looks okay on you.
Wow.
You didn't kill me.
This time.
Don't get used to it, jerk.
Yes!

Whoo-hew!

Yeah!

Oh, yeah, baby!
Let's go!
Nice play.
Almost bought it myself.
We move tomorrow.
I'm tired, Gar.
Yeah, sure, totally get it.
See you tomorrow.

Whoo!
Yeah, I got them all in.
Hey, I know I'm a noob but I got this.
See you when you get here, Traci.
The guest of honor with one million followers is...
Uh, here?
Hello?
Kevin?

I think we should look over the files again, this afternoon.
Make sure we didn't miss anything.
Oh!
Sure thing.
And per your orders, I'll check on Jaime and Gar.
You don't have to do that, but thanks.
By the way...
The warlords of Okaara didn't teach me much about cooking.
I think you should pick something up on the way back.
See you soon, babe.
What's going on?
Not sure.

We got a new guy.
Jaime?
Jaime?
Argo!
Titans, Blue Beetle has been taken.
Gather at the tower.
This is Kori and dick.

So leave a message.
Starfire, pick up if you're there.

Get to the tower now.
Argo!
Oh, come on, Gar.
Kori, you here?
Kori.
Argo!
Bad day, Nightwing?
It's about to get worse.
What have you done with Kori and the others?
Don't fret.
I'm here to take you to them.
Bring it, asshole.
Akido needs work.
Your spacing's for shit.
You're overrated, kid.
Damn it.
Argo!
Argo!
Enough.
Screw this.
You could have died by the Blade with honor, Grayson.
Loser.
Is it done?
Yeah, we're good.
Argo!
He's lying to you.
About everything.
He had you pegged from the start.
That's how he does it.
Mixing truth with lies.
You're so freaking annoying.
You don't know anything about him.
He saved me.
Let me guess, he kept you isolated.
Dependent.
Told you everyone was your enemy.
Trained you, ruthlessly.
And promised you exactly what you wanted.
Believe me, I know.
I've always hated you.
You and all the others.
The Titans treated you like family.
And you threw it all away.
Stop...
Argo.
Can't I leave you for two minutes?
I can see why you want him dead.
What's wrong?
In a few hours, we're gone.
It's as good as done.
Just glad this is over.
You've been in deep cover for a year.
It's perfectly normal to have feelings for them.
But after this we can be together.
Just like you wanted.
Concentrate on that.
Computer, track Terra Markov's phone.
Discovered, subject is moving.
I'll bet she is.
Brothers and sisters, I have spoken many times about false gods.
These so-called heroes with no allegiance to our cause, are nothing but secular idols and must be ended.
This is the true house of faith and I am the one true god.
Hail brother Blood.

Today, I am claiming their powers for us all.
For we are the seeds of the next generation.
We are the hive of humanity.
And nothing will stand in our way.
Raise me this holy day.
The day of blood.
Hail brother Blood.

Place gives me the creeps.
I hear you.
Ugh...
Huh?

Something's keeping me from using my powers to morph.
Yeah, the machine's doing that.
But, I'm the one who put you here.
Deathstroke.
What have you done to Robin?
I beat the crap out of him for being mouthy.
Come on, you've all had the urge.
Once I get out, I'm gonna break you into little bits.
It's good to have goals, ese.
Me, I'm having waffles, after you're dead.
By the way, can I introduce you to my assistant?
I think you've met.
Hey, team, how's things?
Terra, what did he do to you?
Nothing.

Terra was a key part of my plan.
A natural double agent.
That can't be true.
What can I tell you, Goldilocks.
You win some, you lose some.
We took you in.
Helped you.
Yeah, well, thanks.
Now you're gonna die.
Geez, not a lot of gray area there, huh.
Terra...
Place reminds me of my parents' church.
Bunch of crazies.
Insolent trash.
Who you calling trash?
Keep it together.
Let's be civil to our guests.
Our business is not yet complete.
Sure it is.
You wanted the Titans, and here they are.
Not all of them.
Not Nightwing.
It ruins the machine's symmetry.
We agreed some deaths might be unavoidable.
Things happen.
I accept that.
But I told you even in death there is life to be drawn.
Where is the body?

Therefore, our contract is not complete.
Happily there is still a path to the salvation of our deal.
Don't you agree?
Excellent.
Mayhem.
Argh.
Terra!
Ugh.
Oh...
I should have charged more.
With her powers, you're getting an upgrade.
Amen.
Now, our business is complete.
Slade, help me.
Sorry, kid.

You'll pay for this.
Oh, it's a shame you have to go, sweet cheeks.
We would have been fantastic lovers.
You know, since we're both newly single.
Let it begin!
You think yourself a holy man, blood?
You're filth.
Take heart, sinner.
You are about to become part of the greater good.
We're gonna show you the greater good.
By kicking your ass.
No god is going to save you, Deathstroke.
Word to the wise, blood, whatever you're gonna do to them, do it quickly.
Not feeling so good.
I consider their pain a retribution for their sins against me.
Right.
Have a nice day.
Oh, don't leave now, brother.

What part is that, brother?
When their powers are transferred and I ascend to god state.
Hail me, brethren, for the moment of ascendency has arrived.
Hail, brother Blood.

Hail, brother Blood.

Hail, brother Blood.

Yes, my children, this vessel shall now transform me...
And you are witness.
Hail, brother Blood.

I feel it.
Yes!
My godhood is nearly complete.
Praise him.
All hail brother Blood.
Hail, hail.
Yes...
I knew you'd come.
Hey, papa, here's your pipe.
Argh.
Save some for me.
Don't you know, I am the chosen?
Don't you know, I am divine...
I'm gonna kill you.
I was being studied, like all the rest, wasn't I?
You planned this right from the start.
Calm down.
This is all a big misunderstanding, love.
Terra, no.
Oh, shit.
You heathen brats.
You've destroyed my holy temple.
Argh.
You've robbed me of my destiny.
You will die.
You cannot harm...
No, you stay away from me.
You demon filth.
They're not demons.
Let me show you one.
What the hell?
I planned so long.
I was destined, can't you see?
Please, I beseech you.
I am blood.
I...
I am...
Saved.
I won't let them cage you, my love.
Come on.
Argh!
So long, kid.
Terra...
I'm sorry.
No, Terra...
- No...

Terra!
So, let me ask you this, man, how do you become a titan exactly?
I mean, is there an audition?

'Cause I've been working out, you know, I want in.
Well, Kev, I guess the most important thing to being a titan, is to have a strong sense of family.
Some of us don't have our own, so, we support the ones that do.
Of course, an outgoing personality does hurt but, you know, you gotta have a power.
Something cool.
Something cool?

Thanks.
But, it's not just about the cool super powers, snazzy uniforms and daring adventures.
It's about us helping each other grow.
Be better people.
Listen, I know you're not supposed to talk about this, but I just gotta ask.
There's a new girl, right?
All I can say is that she's a wonderful addition to the team.
- Come on, Gar...

There's no way Starfire is listening to this, man, she's brushing her hair.
Forget it.

Whoa, man, he just turned into a seal, folks, I swear.
But really, Gar, is she gonna, like, replace Terra?
Terra?
Yeah, you know, there are lots of stories about her.
I know.
Ooh, too soon?
Yeah.
I mean, that's cool honestly, if you don't wanna...
But, I'd like to say something...
There are a lot of people who've been handed a rough life.
They never asked for it, but...
They do what they can.
Many of them can't rise above the hurt.
It's just too hard.
But in the end, when the chips were down, and she finally showed her true self,
Terra Markov was like a diamond.
Most beautiful thing that I'd ever seen.
I talk to the dead.
For no matter how rotted the corpse, there's always a tiny wisp of life left.
