(EXHALES)
All right, boys.

Nice and easy.
Oh, man, Mitch, if you weren't here...
I'm always here.
Don't worry, your friend's gonna be all right.
Are you Batman?
Sure, pal.

- All right, boys, get him in.

All right, Steph.
- Yeah, Mitch.

Hows it looking out there?
Lippers are feebs today.

Waves are shitty today.
Eggy beyond.

Yup.

- Good call, brah.

(BOTH GRUNTING)
- All right, brah-brah!

Later!
- Come on, Pete.

MITCH:

I want to.

You think I'm gonna forget that?
All right.

And don't cover up my front bump.
You got it.

MITCH:

- Yo, Ellerbee.

Hey, come on, man, why don't you leave my boys alone, and get off this big wheel and come join me for a run?
What are you saying, that I need to work out?
That I'm, what, looking smaller'?
No!

I don't know how you fit in that uniform, man.
- Oh, yeah?

If I had a sister, I'd introduce you to her, man.
You all right, all right.
Wait, was that sarcastic?
Like calling a tall guy "Shorty?
Damn it, he always does that to me.
I heard he invented Google and gave it all to charity.
Man, I heard he invented the cure for the common cold.
He ain't Superman, he's a damn county lifeguard.
Grown man wears spandex to work.
So does Superman.
Hey, fuck you!

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
I don't even have to stretch to guard you.

Nothing, nothing, nothing.
(PLAYERS EXCLAIM)
(ALL EXCLAIM)
Ahh!

- MITCH:

He saved my mama's life.

Every time he jogs by.
Literally, every single time.
WOMAN:

Flakka.

Hey, what's up, buddy?
- Hey, Mitch.

Ah...
- Where'd you get this?

Right there, huh?

All right.
You could go over there, you could go the fuck over there, get the fuck out of here!
What pan of "private" do you not understand?
Hey, hey.

Ah...
- Beach belongs to everybody.

That's not nice.
- There are killer waves, boys.

- Later, Mitch.

Ah, you don't want to do that, big dog.
I'm an animal lover, but I will put you down.
Frankie!

Frankie, stop.
Don't you know he's a friend?
What a terrible, terrible way to meet.
- You're Lieutenant Buchannon, right?

Victoria Leeds, the new owner of the Huntley Club.
Of course.

- Oh?

- Well, welcome to Emerald Bay.

I heard you were a head-turner.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)
And I heard you were a charmer.

Nah...
Um, I apologize for Frankie.
I know this beach is public and, honestly, I wish the club was, too.
- But you, you're welcome anytime.

- I'll see you around?

Okay, I get that you have to test for image stabilization, but Why'd we have to come to the beach?
You know I hate the beach.
Besides, I got to get back to work at the Huntley.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but the beach is important, okay?

It's, you know, the wind and the, uh... (STUTTERS) Just... on... (LAUGHS) I get it.
- I get it now, okay.

No, I didn't even know she was working on the beach today.
"I didn't know C.J. was working."
- Shut up, Dave.

Ha...
It's Ronnie, right?
What the fuck?

- I'm Dave.

DAVE:

DAVE:

You're trying out today, right?
(MUMBLES)
I saw your name on the board.

Say...

Kinda feel like this is your year.
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)
Stop that.
(MUMBLES)
Okay.

Well, I'll see you at tryouts.
Eh...

(MUMBLES)
That was amazing to watch.
She came up to you, she was very nice and warm.
And you handled it really smoothly.
- Really?

- It was horrible.

Did you have a stroke?

Hey, I'm Matt Brody.
And not a single fuck was given.
Ooh!
- STEPHANIE:

Welcome back.

Third time's a charm, right?
Yeah, yeah, you know, I'm...
Hey.
I'm more motivated than ever.
So you just need to fill out this form and take off your shirt.
Ahh...

No one wants to see that.
Take it off.
Okay.

Ooh!
Wow.

Hey, does anyone have a weed whacker?
(MAKES WHIRRING NOISE)
We got a comedian on the line.

- I'm Zane.

Why don't you step out of my line, Zane?
- Okay.

You need to understand one thing, Zane.

A team.

- You're out.

- Get the fuck off my beach.

So you're going to make me guess your name?
Are you following me?
I was actually just going to ask you the same thing.
Okay.

I may resist for a while, but we both know eventually I'll give in.
So why don't we just skip that.
Why don't you put a baby in me?
- Now.

I was thinking dinner first.
But we could try the baby thing, if you want.
You are trying.

Trying's the best pan.
- Summer.

I was hoping we'd see you here.
I couldn't sleep last night.

Hey, it's your day today, Summer.
- SUMMER:

Hey, fresh face.

Uh, no, no, I'm not trying out.
I'm actually already on the team.
You're already on this team?
I'm Matt Brody.

"Ready for duty"?

Urn, you got any papers or anything like that?
I do.

Oh, it's a permission slip.

"I am pleased to write you on behalf of Mr. Matt Brody."
- Right.

At all.

I legit needed those for my taxes.
What you need is to understand that if you're going to be on this team,
- you got to earn it.

Yeah.

Where you from, One Direction?
Urn...

- Iowa?

Yeah, I know what it is.
- Hey, Steph.

New Kids on the Block here is from Iowa.
Oh, man.
And, uh, he says he's already on the team.
- Yeah.

- Really?

Let me ask you this...

No, just ponds and lakes and cocky pretty boys, apparently.
Uh-huh.

Hey, Mitch, what happened to that last pretty boy recruit we had?
- He died.

Are you guys being serious right now?
I honestly can't tell.
You show up here, matching bathing suits.
What is this, "lifeguard hazing"?
I'm Matt Brody.
I hold the world record in the 200 meter.
Two gold medals.
- Hey!

- (LAUGHS)

Absolutely.

- don't give a fuck.

No, fresh out.

Okay, that ocean out there has riptides that'll tear your little mangina in two.
MY mangina?
So you are being serious.
Dead serious, right now, NSYNC, all right?
This ain't no little fucking pond out of Iowa.
So with all due respect, you want to be here on this team, on our team, you're gonna have to earn it.
Look, I get it.
You're big, Sasquatch.
But I'm fast.
Really fucking fast.
Which is why somebody important thinks I belong here.
So when you two figure out who the fuck I am, you can find me on the beach.
See you. (MAKES KISSING SOUND)
Did that really just happen?
- It did.

Yeah.

- like a woman.

You know what, man?

I'm feeling really good about this year.
You know what I'm saying?
Good luck out there, man.

Thanks.
And if you need some extra motivation...
- Looking at it right there.

You okay?

DAVE:

(WEAKLY) No, not C.J. Not C.J. No, no!
Are you okay?

(GRUNTING)
(C.J. GRUNTING)
(SPITS)
- (GASPING)

Are you okay?
- Ronnie.

What?
Ah!

(BONE CRACKS)
(GROANING)
- Ronnie, are you okay?

- (RONNIE MUMBLING)

Yeah, yeah.

Okay.
I'm so good.

RONNIE:

Okay, um, drink some water...
- Thank you so much.

- (WHISPERING) Dave?

- How does it look?

Down there.
(CREAKING)
Does not look good at all.
Yeah, what does it look like?
Looks like your dick is trapped between two slats of wood.
Okay, I just...

I just need you to get down there and just pop it out.
No, I can't do that at all.
Come on, I just need you...

- and you push it out.

- Okay.

I'm going to help you.
We're going to deflate the situation together.

- (WEAKLY) Okay.

Think about things that turn you off.
Maybe like, um...

- Mmm-mmm.

- Maybe, like...

- Guys, still stuck.

No, no, not Mitch.

- Hey.

Ronnie, you pumped about the qualifiers, buddy?
You know it, man.

Really excited to quit my double major in robotics and computer science and really, really do something with my life.
You don't need to look down there.
Do not touch me right now.
- Not even touching you.

(EXHALES) Wow.

Locks like you got your beef and your biscuits
- stuck down there.

It's gonna be okay.

- C.J.:

Yeah, absolutely.

Couldn't get out.
- Totally the same, yeah?

Stuck junk is stuck junk.
(STAMMERING) Stuck junk is stuck junk.

All right, buddy, we're gonna have to, uh, flash-freeze your Johnson.
No, no, it's okay, it's okay, I got it.
Look, it's okay. (GRUNTS)
C.J.:

(GROANING)
I mean, if you think about it, it's a good thing, right?
Congratulations. (CHUCKLES) - (CHUCKLES)
MITCH:

RONNIE:

Nah.

God, you're lying.

Mitch, I can't get the swelling to go down.
All right.
We're going to have to pull it out.
- Pull it?

- Just like pulling a tooth.

Don't you touch my dick!
I'm okay. (GROANS)
(CROWD EXCLAIMS) (GROANING)
C.J.:

(GRUNTS) Yeah, no, I'm good.

DAVE:

RONNIE:

Captain, uh, I need to talk to you about this...
Yeah, Mitch.

I want you to watch something.
Check this out.
NARRATOR:

BRODY:

80% trill and 30% dope.
People think Fm crazy, mat Fm out of control.
How do you think I got all this gold?
NARRATOR: "Crazy and out of control"
may have worked far his individual events, but when it came to the relay, Brody blew it for the team.
COMMENTATOR:

Oh, my God!
Looks like he just vomited in the pool.
NARRATOR:

Brody was dubbed the "Vomit Comet."
How do you feel about losing a medal for your teammates?
There's no "I" in "team."
But there is a "me."
Are you dyslexic'?
I'm Caucasian.
(BRODY CHUCKLES) (REMOTE CLICKS)
This is the guy you think is a good PR opportunity for us?
Wow.

He's reckless, he's insubordinate.

Which is why we can afford him.
Come on, Mitch.
The guy's only here because he took a plea deal.
(SCOFFS) A plea deal?
For what?
(CLEARS THROAT) The specifics aren't important.
What's important is that we are his community service.
Come on.

With two gold medals.
How many gold medals do you have?
Probably zero.

Brody is an American hero with the face of a Swedish model.
You're losing me.
He's one of the best swimmers in the whole world.
There's more to this job than just swimming.
- You know that.

Now, look, Mitch, let's be honest.
We're staring into the abyss here.
City council's already cut our funding again.
What the council wants and what the bay needs are two different things.
I found more flakka this morning.
Clearly, we have new dealers in the bay.
And this shit is like bath salts on meth.
Wow, flakka?
Good work, Mitch.
I'll turn this over to the police.
Hey, look.

He's not ready for this kind of trouble.
He doesn't need to be, and neither do you.

It's not your job.
It's the busiest time of the year.
I need you out there shining for me.
- All right, I'll do it.

But he's got to pass qualifiers first.
- You got it.

Right?
VICTORIA:

- Good afternoon.

Most of the council has signed off on your terms.
Good.
And the rest are almost there.
"Almost"?
(CLICKS TONGUE) Ugh.

Me, too.
Back home, my younger brother was given the family business to run when clearly I had the business gene.
Why?

So I came to America, the Land of Opportunity, because everything is fair here.
But who's to say anymore?
I have a point to prove, Councilman.
And I'm hereto create an opportunity for you.
(EXHALES)
I'm sure they'll come around.
I'm sure they will, too.
Why does she always look like she's running in slo-mo'?
You see it, too?
She always looks wet.

Right.
She's the reason I believe in God.
Hey, hows your dick?
Oh, uh, it's good, you know... (STAMMERS) It's better, you know...
It's just ready for action. (LAUGHS)
- (CHUCKLES) Okay.

Okay.
I got my dick stuck in a chair earlier.
- What?

You haven't heard about this?
Yeah, I heard.

All right.

You know, Baywatch proudly accepts only one new recruit every year.
Bu!

Now without further ado, I'd like to tum it over to the man who has 500 career saves.
Give it up far Lieutenant Mitch Buchannon.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
All fight, thank you.

Baywatch is the elite of the elite.
Our team's commitment to protecting the bay at all costs is the reason why the single mom behind me feels very comfortable letting her two kids run right into the water unaccompanied.
(CHILDREN GIGGLING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
STEPHANIE:

And Baywatch works because we follow rules.
We follow rules because if we don't, people die.
You work in an office and you doze off at your desk one day, no big deal.
You slack off here...

ALL:

So here's the thing, if you've come to Baywatch on your little motorcycle, thinking you're cool, trying to wom on your killer tan...
Wail, you need to find another beach to go to.
But if you've some to sacrifice for something much bigger than yourself, this is the beach for you.
But you're gonna have to get through this first.

Yeah!

There are tons oi qualities that make a great lifeguard.
Today, we're gonna test ail o?

"The Absentee Father."
He's tough.

His presence in your life is brief, but it will scar you and instill a toughness in you that will carry you through birthdays,
Christmases and even "Bring Your Dad To School Day"
when your mom has to put on a fake moustache just so you can fit in with the other kids.
MITCH:

Thank you, C.J.
Thank you.
So get out there, kick ass and make us proud.
Go, Baywatch.
(ALL CHEERING)
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
On your mark.
Get set!
(BLOWS WHISTLE)
(CROWD CHEERING)
(CHEERING)
STEPHANIE: (ON MEGAPHONE) This is Baywatch, people!
- Kick those legs!

Come on, let's go!
MITCH: (ON MEGAPHONE) Listen to what she's saying.
Keep it going!

You are guppies!
One day you will be sharks!
STEPHANIE:

Who's your daddy now?
Come on, guys!
(CHEERING CONTINUES)
C.J.:

Hustle, hustle, hustle!
Let's go!

Let's go!

Up and over!
(C.J. WHOPPING)
Let's go, come on!

Kid's really got no quit in him.
(GROWLING)
Attaboy, Ronnie!

Great!
Oh, fuck.
You know, you wanna be on our team, you're gonna have to pass this course.
- We all do.

- Lieutenant to you.

Like in the army?
Let me save you some time.

You're not gonna be my big brother here and put me on the right path.
It doesn't work like that.
I got where I am today completely by myself.
So how about you let me do my job, and I'll tell you where to send my checks?
You know, sharks always swim slowly.
Until they need to attack.
Thank you for that cryptic and totally irrelevant piece of information.
What are you, Aquaman?
'Cause I'm really confused with what we've been talking about.
Come on, Gold Medal.
You afraid I'm gonna kick your Little Mermaid ass all over this course in front of all these people?
I mean, now you're gonna have to beat me on the big boy's course, princess.
(INHALES SHARPLY AND EXHALES)
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
(APPLAUSE)
Whoo!
Well, that was cute.
Probably in record time.

The problem is, that's not the course.
That's not the course?
So here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna go over to the real course, and if you beat me over there, not only are you on the team, but I won't fuck with you anymore and I'll call you by your real name.
Oh' really'?
(CROWD CHEERING)
(BELL CLANGING) (EXCLAIMS) Yeah!
News
(MITCH GROWLING)
(BELL CLANGING)
Refrigerators?
CROWD: 98,99, 100!
(ALL CHEERING)
(BELL CLANGING)
Ahhh!
Whoo!
(SCOFFS) That was bullshit, Mitch.
You know I was already gassed.
Because you were showboating.

Conserve my energy?
(WOMAN SCREAMING)
- WOMAN:

WOMAN:

Lifeguard Tower One!
(ENGINE STARTS)
Help!
(ENGINE REVVING)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Look out!

We're on the go!
Come on, move!
Yo, move!
Watch it!

(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)
MAN:

Lady, get out of the way!
(WOMAN SCREAMING)
- My kids!

I'm here to save you.

- (PUNCHING) - (BRODY GRUNTS)
- WOMAN:

I can't save you if you're being a dick!
- Where are the other two?

Oh, shit.
(WOMAN SCREAMS)
- Here you go.

C.J.:

You're okay.
Come on.
Breathe for me.

MITCH:

(PANTING)
We'll set you down right here.
Good.

(COUGHING)
- C.J.:

- Brody, stop!

Her airway's blocked.
(CHOKES AND GASPS)
Okay, breathe.

- Steph, how is she?

You're gonna be good.
Give me some.
Let's get you to your mom.
(CROWD CHEERING)
MITCH:

We want to thank you for a great year of qualifiers.
For those of you who don't go on and become trainees, we wanna thank you, we expect to see you next year.
To the trainees who made it, congratulations.
Oh, my God.

(GASPS) I made it!

- (CHUCKLES)

MITCH:

You did this one on your own.
- Thank you.

What the fuck?

(LAUGHS) That's my name!
Holy shit!
I made it onto...
Wait.

No!
No, I chose you because you have heart, no quit and you leave it all out on the beach.
RONNIE:

MITCH:

You were reckless out there.
Completely destroyed a motorcycle, which you stole.
(SCOFFS) I didn't steal that.
I commandeered it, okay?
Because it was faster and clearly had insurance.
And by the way, the lady that I saved, she didn't seem to mind.
Let me tell you something, man, the rescues don't mean a thing if you put other people in danger.

Now, I get it, you're fast, you're fearless.
And I have to make you a trainee, butterfly, but you got a lot to learn.
All right.

(CLICKS TONGUE)
All right, listen up!
Training begins at 0600.
Hot Wheels, I'll see you back here in the morning.
Sure thing, Lieutenant.
Welcome to Baywatch.
(RONNIE CHEERING)
All right.
VICTORIA:

I don't mean to interrupt, but everyone on the beach is talking about you guys.
Thank you.
Brody, that save sounds incredible.
Impulsive, but incredible.
Appreciate it.

Ah, we're just doing our jobs.
Oh.
Hey, guys, this is Victoria Leeds, the new owner of the Huntley Club.
- Hey.

Well, I just wanted to invite all of you to the Huntley.

It's a kind of a "meet the neighbors" thing.
Look, I know that the club's kind of "fancy"
and probably not your scene, but you have a standing invitation.
Thank you.

- I'll see you there?

Let's go, Frankie.
(ENGINE STARTS)
(SIGHS)
C.J.:

- Hey.

Nothing.

You know, stargazing.
Under a pier?
Yeah.

Look, you're on the team, and, um, I don't want anyone on the team sleeping outside, so...
Yeah, come on.

Brody, let's go, I don't want to wait for you.

BRODY:

Really embarrassed.
C...

Oh, I forgot something in my car.
Urn, just...

You sure Stephanie won't mind?

It's cool.

Thank you so much.
This is really cool of you guys.
Mmm-hmm.

(GASPS) What the fuck?
- Sup.-

This is your house, isn't it?
Yeah, this is, um...

Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
I assume you need a place to crash.
- Yeah.

Just like C.J., always picking up strays.
(SIGHS)
Quit looking at Little Mitch!

Come and see where you're gonna crash.
There's your cot.
Don't jack off on my sheets.
Don't.
MAN 1: (ON RADIO) I can't find my hermit crab.
I think he ran out earlier today.
He's got short legs, but he's got a fast walk, so, if you'd keep eyes open, Pd appreciate that.
MAN 2: (ON RADIO) I will start combing the beach first thing at sunup.
MAN 3:

Fuck it.

MITCH: (ON RADIO) Jonas Brother, listen to me.
Get your beauty rest.
We're starting bright and early tomorrow.
(GROANS)
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
How was your first riptide?
(GROANING)
It stings!
That's just the lactic acid.
Actually, it's the jellyfish stuck to you.
(SCREAMING)
What the fuck?
(WHIMPERING)
Oh. my God!
One, two, three.

One, two, three.
Keep your hands up.

One, two, duck!
(GRUNTS) Nice!
What you, uh...

Urn, I don't know.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
- I don't know.

Honestly, I don't even know what I'm doing here.
Mitch sees something in you.
And I see it, too.

I really do.
What?
- What?

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Very important lesson.
That is the Devil's Urchin.
One prick out of that thing will give you enough adrenaline to choke out a pissed-off bull.
The only problem is, after that, you say some crazy-ass shit, and then you fucking die.
Now pick that up and take it to Tower One.
So these are just like laying around everywhere?
Do you want me to help you?
Okay, look, let's just be honest, all right?
I mean, we've lost him.
- No, it's not your fault.

- (BOTH WAILING)

Why, why, Ted?

Why?
Don't you do this to me, Ted!

(BOTH LAUGH)
Okay, no.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Wait, Summer, do you have time to study later?
Yeah.

Did you just, uh, look at my boobs?
I...

I didn't, uh, stare directly at them.
You're looking at them right now.
Now I did.
'Cause you're talking about them.
Testing.

Oh, my God.

- in swimsuits a lot, so...

If it's gonna be a problem for you...
There's not a problem for me.
- At all.

All right.

- No, I didn't.

Well, when you point them out like that...
It's a compliment if you think about it, sort of.
COUNCILMAN:

I'm gonna need more time.
(SIGHS) Do I strike you as a patient woman' Councilman?
No, no, I got the council to sign off on your real estate proposal.
Just some property owners won't give approval.
But I'm working on it.
Yeah, well, you just ran out of time.
Leon, would you show Mr. Rodriguez what we do to people who don't deliver?
I know you're dealing flakka, which is gonna drive down real estate prices in the bay, right?

So if anything happens to me, I will expose you.
And then you'll never get your approvals.
Such accusations.
I'm not a Bond villain.
Well, yet.
You're in politics.
You know that no one can claw their way to the top without getting a little din under their fingernails.
Clearly, I overestimated you.
But calling me a drug dealer...
It's so much bigger than that, you know?
- L...

Teach him some manners.
Have fun, boys.
I agree with...
I overstepped.
I overstepped, Victoria.
Guys, we can talk about this.
Leon doesn't talk.

- There's a purity to that.

Damn it.

I build you up, and then you ruin the mystique.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
(HUMMING)
- See something you like?

- (LAUGHS)

You're gonna be cool and go talk to her like a real man, or you gonna stand up here and be Creepy Creeperton through the binoculars?
Look, man, I'm fine in that department,
- so don't worry about me.

I'm sure your approach to women is Snapchatting a dick pic or two.
Don't ever do that.
A lot of people screenshot them nowadays.
Yeah.

WOMAN: (ON RADIO) Hola?

This is Baywatch.

(WOMAN SPEAKING SPANISH)
Please help!
Please help!

We are lust...
We are lost".

What is your position?

WOMAN: (IN ENGLISH) Gringa, my position is the ocean.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
I can't feel my face!
Okay, call Coast Guard.

- I'm gonna take the WaveRunner.

You and C.J. take Rescue One.
- Go, go, go!

Hold up!

Shit.
- Summer?

"Fire"?

You need to start studying!
Yeah, I know.

See you out there.
- MITCH:

- If you're comin', hurry up.

You don't get one.
Whoa!
Come on.

- Could you wait for me?

God damn it, let's go.
Go, go, go!
Lock your arms around my waist or you're gonna fucking fall off again!
- This is so awkward, dude.

BRODY:

You're like a greasy, hairless gorilla.
Don't worry, guys!

I'll take care of...

All right, I need you to take the throttle.
That's impossible.
Go between my arms and take the fucking throttle!
Holy shit.
When I say so, hard right turn.
- What?

- Two.

(GASPING)
Oh, thank God.
Are you the fire water man?
Tell me, where are your friends?
- I don't know.

- Don't move.

WOMAN:

Down here!
- Is anyone there?

MITCH:

Get to the front of the boat!

WOMAN:

(SCREAMING)
Help me!
Mitch!
Portside.
Over here!
- MITCH:

There's a girl trapped in the front of the boat!
There's too much fire!
No way.
(WOMAN SPEAKING SPANISH)
C.J.!
Okay, guapo.
If you want me, you can have me.
But rapido because the boat is on fire.
- Some other time.

C.J.:

No, I'm not okay!
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
WOMAN 2:

Help!

(EXHALES)
Do not go under that fire, Brody!
Wait!
WOMAN 2:

Please!

- Oh, my God!

- Trust me.

- Are you hurt?

- Good.

- (GRUNTS) C.J.!

MITCH:

- (SCREAMING)

WOMAN 2:

C.J.:

(GRUNTING)
SUMMER:

- (COUGHING)

Are you okay?
That was such a great plan, just to see fire and just swim right into it.
You care about me.
- I care about you.

Get off that boat, Mitch.
- (GRUNTING) - eight, nine, ten.
MITCH:

Hey, other than him, we did good, right'?
Like, we saved everyone.
Yes, including you.
I know that.
I'm just saying, all things considered, things could've gone a lot worse.
MITCH:

Is he going to be okay?
Do you know what happened to the Councilman?
No, I don't know.
We were partying, and then when we came upstairs, the boat was already on fire.
(MITCH SIGHS)
You disobeyed an order out there, put yourself in danger.
You can't save anyone if you die.
Yeah, I know.

I'm just...

- Just write this down.

Victim is male, five foot nine...
Hey, hey, hey.

Come on, Ellerbee.
Don't give me any of that jurisdiction shit.
Uh, no, I won't, because technically, you don't have a jurisdiction, lifeguard.
You got one job, make sure swim-happy white people don't drown.
Technically, that boat out there is the Coast Guards jurisdiction.

And if I would've waited for them, all these girls would be dead.
- What?

- Burned to a crisp.

I know.

So technically, we saved lives.
Technically, I see a dead body, which technically makes this a crime scene.
Hey, technically, these "technicallys" are wasting a lot of time, technically.
Thank you, blue-eyed demon.
(SIGHS)
And as far as this dead body goes, look.
Badge on a uniform.
Patch on a swimsuit.
Lieutenant.

So keep us informed of the investigation and we're gonna do the same.
All right.

Seashell phone, or do I just blow into the conch and you appear?
That's the spirit, Ellerbee.
Just call me on the shell phone.

I'll tell you this, if you crack this case, they're gonna upgrade you to a Segway and they're gonna give you big-boy pants to wear, cover up those chicken legs.
- Oh, Christ, that's...

Good luck, Officer.
RONNIE: (SINGING) ♪ I got the eye of the tiger ♪

♪ Dancing through the fire ♪
♪ 'Cause I am the champion ♪
♪ And you're gonna hear me roar ♪
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪
- Damn, Ronnie.

Please!
Oh, shit.
I never really heard a guy sing that song, but you're really good.
Thank you.
Uh, C.J., what are you doing here?
Here?

Coed, cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
Yeah, coed is cool with me, 'cause I'm cool with the coeds.
I'm taking lunch orders.

(FLAPPING LIPS)
I would like a salad.
You sure?
This place has really good cheesesteaks, meatball subs, foot-longs.
- They really hit the spot.

I'm just a straight-up leafy green type of guy.
That's my type of jam.
Just hook me up with a salad.
Okay.

- Cool.

By the way, uh, when we shower in here, we, uh, keep our suits on.
Right, Phil, Sarah?
(BOTH LAUGHING)
But your, uh, clean nips are looking really good.
(SLAPS) Ah!
- Thanks.

Oh, God.
Why me'?
(SIGHS)
How was your day today?
Uh, I don't know.

Maybe this is why we keep losing recruits.
- They can't handle it.

I mean, now that you know our job is much more than you expected, right, the stakes are higher.
What happened today, while very tragic, unfortunately, it does happen.
So if you want to quit, hey, we totally get it.
But if you don't and you choose to stay, just know that Baywatch is more than a job.
It's a way of life.
"A way of life."
(SLURPING)
You and I both know I'm sticking around.
Am I the only one that got a salad?
Look, this is what I don't understand, okay?
A guy dies.

But that doesn't mean that there's anything sinister going on.
Okay?

We're lifeguards.

You just heard that cop.

I just thought you had to be on a really restrictive diet to look like you guys.
Brody, what is it that you think we do here at Baywatch?
I thought we were lifeguards.
I thought that we prevent people from getting sunburned and, yeah, occasionally stop them from drowning.
And that's all you think that this is?
It's exactly what I thought it was.
C.J., how about you throw a few of last month's cases at Olympiad here and see what he'd do.
- "Cases"?

School of manta ray in the cove?
You call Animal Control?
Before Animal Control shows up, the school of manta ray fly up out of the water, sting someone in the chest and they die.
Steve Irwin, R.l.P.
How about, uh, sand grifters running a con on the beach, right?
Well, I'm not exactly sure what a sand grifter is, Stephanie.
But I would probably call the cops.
Sand grifters are, uh, beach thieves.
Okay, so while you're working on your tan, they're stealing things from families on the beach.
I'll give you one better.
How about diamond smugglers who are putting the rocks in surfboards and bringing them ashore?
Everything that you guys are talking about sounds like a really, like, entertaining, but far-fetched TV show.
But if that was the case, I would definitely call the cops.
We could call the cops, and then do nothing, like most people would.

We watch when other people don't want to watch.
We protect when other people don't want to protect.
If we do the bare minimum, sometimes people die.
Guys, we have flakka that just washed ashore.
That shit is hardcore and it fucking kills people.
And now we got a dead body in our bay.
And the girls on that boat had the same drugs on them that I found in front of Leeds's club.
So my gut says that it's all connected.
Wait, Leeds did say there'd be an open house tonight, right?
Yes, she did.
And we're all going.
(PARTY MUSIC PLAYING)
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)
(DOOR OPENS)
What'd you find on Chen?
No criminal record.

No weird photos.

Makes me feel weird about the stuff I have going on in my life.
What about his bank accounts?
Account.
This dude is not rich at all.
All his money is tied up in real estate in the bay.
Well, I guess you'll have to help me persuade him some other way.
Every man has a price.
Speaking of which,
I know you've been using my special set of skills for your own nefarious purposes, but additional compensation would go a long way in motivating me to keep my mouth shut.
(CHUCKLES)
You're blackmailing me.
- Huh?

I really admire a man who knows how to seize an opportunity.
I'm very impressed.
- Keep up the good work.

Do we have a deal, or... (DOOR CLOSES)
I need some closure.
- Hey.

Wow, you look really nice.
Hey, you look really nice, too, Baby Gap.
That shirt come in big-boy size?
Well, at least I'm undercover.
Look at you.

All right, guys, we got a very big night, with one goal in mind.
It's our only shot to prove that they're dealing here, so we gotta make it right.
So, C.J. and Ronnie, find out who's selling.
Summer, keep an eye on Leeds and her thugs.
Then Mitch and I will search the place for where she hides the product.
Brody?

- You're our lookout.

Guys, if you want to find drugs at a party,
I can walk in there and find drugs.
It'd take me, like, five minutes.
Not 'cause I do it all the time.
I'm just saying ifs not rocket science.
Okay, troubled youth.

The only way this whole thing is gonna work out is if everyone, everyone, does their job.
- Can you handle that, Malibu Ken?

What?
Why is everyone looking at me?

Hey, am I the only one that thinks this is clearly a job for the police?
- Yes.

Fuck it.
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Mr. Chen, I'm so glad you could make it.
I wanted to meet the new neighbor everyone is talking about.
So I presume you know why I had to invite you.
I am not interested in selling my properties.
Why don't you think about it, okay?
I of all people know how hard it is to run a business.
You never know when a dry spell could come.
What are you thinking?
I think we case it and I'll meet you back here in five.
- All right.

So where should I, like, look out from?
Hey.

(EXHALES)
Victoria.
(GROANS)
(HISSING)
You killed Rodriguez in front of witnesses.
What the fuck were you thinking?
They were high.

They better not have.
Because now Dave knows too much.
And this better not come back to me.
I can't have this unraveling.
- Got it?

Now go clean up your mess.
- Brody.

I'm so glad you came.
Oh, gosh.
Let's get you a real drink.

- Scotch is your drink, right?

This is a really nice place you have here.
You have great taste.
I really respect that.
It's nice to have somebody who respects you, you know?
Oh...
I sense trouble.
I think I'm just, uh, not used to having a boss.
VICTORIA:

He should be thrilled to have you.
Yeah, you'd think.
Oh, my God.
"Lieutenant Matt Brody."
That has such an amazing ring to it.

Yeah.
Here.

I think you need it. (CHUCKLES)
- This'll be fun.

Hey.
Did you get any intel on Leeds?
- Yeah, I got intel.

Single malt 35-year-old intel.
And it's fucking delicious.
All right, I think I got something.
Found our access point.
Where is Brody?

No.

We gotta move without him.
Yeah, but we need our lookout.
What's your deal?

- (SCOFFS) No.

Well, I mean, I have three brothers, so I've had a lot of practice.
Mmm.
Hake it you're an only child.
I don't know, honestly.
You don't know'?
- I grew up in a foster home.

- Three of them, actually.

Mmm.

It was pretty cool.

If it wasn't for that pool,
I probably wouldn't have gone to the Olympics.
Yeah.

Go from foster home to winning a gold medal.
- Two.

And I fucking busied my ass for those gold medals, so you can't blame me for celebrating.
Yeah.

I mean, I've always wondered what happened that night.
I knew the relay was the next day, but those guys...
They didn't care about me.

Well, you certainly made sure they did not win.
(LAUGHS) I lost way more than they did.
Okay?

I'm an Olympic champion and I'm fucking broke.
- Ronnie, hey.

Okay, listen.

What?

Remember the first time I met you?
The night at Chews?
(CHUCKLES) on, yeah.
What?

- Yes.

- Yes!

- Yes.

- No!

You listen to me, and you listen good.
Every team has a ringer, and you and only you are my ringer.
Well, then I guess I'm your ringer.
You are my goddamn ringer.
(GRUNTS)
- Ring, ring?

Yeah.

Oh, could I...
Will you just have one drink with me?
You should probably actually stop drinking because you're supposed to be the lookout for Mitch.
I am looking out for Mitch.
Leeds is right there.

RONNIE:

A warm welcome to our host, Victoria Leeds!
(GUESTS CHEERING)
Thank you.

So many people.
(RONNIE CHUCKLES)
So as a welcome to the bay, I, uh...
Oh, God.

Oh, wait.

I have something very special planned for you, for everyone.
So God help us.
Aw.
I'll just put that down.

Hil it.
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
That's weird.
Who's Angelo's Fish Company?
Doesn't the Huntley get their fish from Flynn's?
Let's check it out.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Mitch.
I just got a little hunch, okay?
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
Shit.
You two, what are you doing back here?
MITCH:

First date.

(MUSIC CONTINUES)
So juvenile.
I'm onto you all.
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for whatever that was.
(ALL CHEERING)
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
You did good, Ronnie.
Where'd you learn to dance like that?
(EXHALES) Hebrew school.
You were supposed to be there for us tonight.
You had a job to do.
And now you're trashed.
See, I just...

If you really think that there's drugs here, call the police.
And then what?
We get a few minnows?

Do you hear yourself when you talk?
I dare you to say one thing without the ocean in it.
I dare you.
We were depending on you tonight.
(SCOFFS)
And you fucked up...

Watch yourself.
Really?
Get this through your head, Mitch.
You're not a cop.

You're a lifeguard, Mitch, who sits in his fucking tower all day, 'cause that's the only place he has any son of power.
This is the real world, Mitch.
Lifeguards can't do shit.
Come on.
Don't fucking touch me.
- Let's go.

What're you gonna do, Mitch?
Shit.
- (GROWLS) - (SHRIEKS)
- Shit.

You dick.
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
Cool off, pool boy.
(RETCHING)
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
That's him!

What are you guys standing around for'?
Let's do some shots!
(ALL CHEERING)
Whoo!
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(GASPS)
(GRUNTS)
- Hey.

Summer, this is your day today.
SUMMER:

Mitch?
Hey, man, I think, uh...
I think we both said a few things last night that we didn't mean.
Not me.

Come on, man.
You've never gotten drunk and said something you don't mean?
Seriously?
I fucked up, man.

I'm sorry.
I watched you win two gold medals.
You were amazing when it was just you.
But when it came to the relay, being part of your team, your Olympic team, your family,
you blew it.

Baywatch is our team.

These are the keys to our house.
But you've proven to me that you don't want to be part of this family.
So you're done.
'Cause the only thing you give a shit about is yourself and your medals.
You talking 'bout this medal?
Wow, that's really impressive.
Don't you have two of them, though?
That's not the point.
That's polluting.
Listen, Mitch, I know I messed up, okay?
I should have listened.
I want to be a part of this team.
And I will not let you down again, I swear.
And by the way, I think you're right about Leeds.
And the Councilman...

- Councilman Rodriguez.

Rodriguez, that's it.

He had this watch.

Yeah, I've seen that watch, too.
On one of Leeds's thugs.
That's it.

I want to help, man.

I want to help.
(SIGHS)
All right.

Councilman Rodriguez is connected to all of this somehow.
And the coroner's office just released his body.
And I gut a plan.
Ah, guys, I still don't understand what part of the plan this is.
- Just go with the flow, Brody.

- It was all your fucking fault.

It was my fault?

(GROANS) Come on, guys.

There's no coat in here that's gonna fit you.
- You got a better idea?

But you're not gonna like it.
Okay, clear.

BRODY:

- MITCH:

MITCH:

BRODY:

Just get me to the morgue.

BRODY:

Left, left.

SUMMER:

BRODY:

SUMMER:

All right.
- Oh, no.

- What does that say?

Exactly. (CHUCKLES)
I got us to the morgue.
- (EXHALES) Nice.

BRODY:

I actually feel like a doctor.
Oh, no.
- Read me his toe tag.

Oh, Jesus.
"2816.".
(BRODY GROANS)
Read me line 12.
Jesus.
Line 12. "Alveoli are clean."
Wait, that means that there was no smoke in his lungs.
- So how did he die?

McDreamy, get over here.

Oh, God, what?
(GROANS) Dude.
I need you to check his taint for needle marks.
You want me to check his taint?
Don't be a baby.

Not touching the man's scrotum.
Lift his ball sac and check for anything unusual.
There's...

(GRUNTS) on, my God.
(EXCLAIMING)
- Dude, it's a taint, man, it's a taint.

Ugh, my God.
Dude, there's been gloves here literally the entire time.
You didn't even say anything.

- All right.

Hair.

Get deeper.

- And get closer.

I don't know, man.

There's something.

- That's just his butthole.

(CHUCKLING)
Good job, doc.

Do not post that.

It's just a handful of ball sac.
It's disgusting.
- (SIGHS)

Dude, I can't take you seriously when the dick is out.
Can you please just cover the dick?
You cover the dick.

(SIGHS)
MITCH:

Cervical fractures of the fifth, sixth and seventh vertebrae.
That's how he was killed.

So, what?

I mean, you jumped off the boat with him, right'?
You can literally swan dive down a flight of stairs and not break that many vertebrae.
This was done on purpose.
Why has no one else figured this out?
What are you talking about?

Broken neck in multiple places.
No smoke in his lungs, which probably means he died before that boat was even on fire.
The reason why no one has figured this out?
It's murder.
- And someone's covering it up.

In which case,
I should go interrogate those girls.
No, those girls were too high.

All the more reason to investigate.
Oh, shit.

- SUMMER:

(GROANS)
- What do we do now'?

Hide?

I don't like confined spaces.
(SHUSHING)
This was a bad idea.
Stop being a baby.
Oh. my God!
Shut your mouth.

I'm laying on a dead old lady.
Well, she's not going to bite you, for Christ's sakes.
- Will you shut up?

Why'd you pick that drawer?
I'm the only one with a body in my drawer?
Shh.

She smells like cheese toast and chowder.
Holy Christ.

Who gives a shit right now'?
This was a bad...
Something just dripped on me.
Shut your mouth.
- What is it?

- Oh, my God.

- It did it again.

- Listen to me.

That's what's dripping on your face, necrotic liquid fat.
Now will you shut the fuck up?
What the fuck did you just say?
Just sit back and shut up.
Shh.

Guys, someone's coming.

It's him.
FRANKIE:

You got the fake files?
Relax.
We're only here 'cause you broke his fucking neck.
(PANTING)
It's all good.
(GROANS)
- God damn it.

- On, shit.

No.

(EXCLAIMING)
- Shit!

(PANTING)
(BRODY GARGLING)
What do we do?
(SHUSHING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(GASPS AND COUGHS)
(CLEARS THROAT) Hey, gentlemen.
Now that that's over, I'm gonna need those files.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Shit.
That must be my phone.

- Shit.

Shit!
No, lifeguard.
(GRUNTS)
BRODY:

(BOTH PANTING)
Damn it.
I'll get the car.
All right, meet us on the far side of the park!
- Come on, let's roll.

Check this out.
Excuse me.

Have you ever seen the Olympics?
BRODY:

MITCH:

Stay off the grass.

Stay on the pathway.
I'm on the path, man.

MITCH:

You got a beautiful border collie right there.

You do not respect anything.
- (TIRES SCREECHING)

Have some respect Mommies and babies.
- Mommies and babies.

Go get them.

All right.

Give me the phone.
Hey!
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(PANTING)
(GRUNTS)
Oh!
Shit!

- I cannot believe I just did that!

- Oh, my God!

That's not my phone!
- Summer, you okay?

- Nice work!

- Where'd he go?

(PANTING)
Mister, get off!
(YELLING)
Hey, Mitch, take this one.
Yeah.

MAN 1:

Hey!

(GUN CLICKS)
(BOTH GRUNTING)
- (BABY COOING)

I'm going to go get rid of the bad man that's in your house.
Mmm.

CHILD:

(BOTH GRUNTING)
I'm gonna need that phone.
This phone?
Whoops.

Oh, you're going night-night, bitch.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
(MOBILE PLAYS MUSIC)
(GROANING)
(GRUNTING)
TOY:

Whoa, whoa, wait!

No baby pictures.
- Have some class.

It's bath time, shithead.
All right, Ellerbee, what did we learn from the perps after the interrogation?
The only perps here are you three.
Okay, you turned the canals into the goddamned X Games.
Yeah, that's 'cause we were in lifeguard pursuit.
Oh, okay.

Except for there's no fucking such thing as "lifeguard pursuit"!
Police do pursuits!
When you do it, it's just some guys chasing some other guys.
- No offense.

Hey, what are you saying?

Okay, um, how do I explain this so that you people understand?
"You people"?
"You people"?
Oh, you don't get to say that.
You're just tan.
- Right on.

Look, even if you were police, which you're not, and even if this was your jurisdiction, which it isn't, and even if you had probable cause to pursue, which you definitely don't,
what you did would still be totally illegal.
Okay, well, I mean, it's a good thing we're not police, then.
It's like you purposely only hear 1% of what I say.
Mitch, did you pull Brody off the beach to break into the medical examiners office earlier today?
Yeah, you bet I did.
Absolutely, 100% and here's why.
The Councilman's boating accident was no accident at all.
He had no smoke in his lungs, his neck was broken in multiple places.
Which means he was probably dead before that boat even caught on fire.
And our investigation has found that all of this shady shit leads right back to the Huntley.
You don't do investigations.

Police do investigations.
When you do it, it's just a bunch of guys investigating another bunch of guys.
- No offense, you're included in that.

Do you have any proof of this conspiracy?
Yeah, absolutely.

It's all in there before those other guys switched it.
Yeah, and I recorded the whole thing on my cell phone.
Where's the cell phone?

Oh.

So the only evidence that you had was destroyed.
Exactly.

Gone.

They're bad guys and they don't want us to have it.
Okay.
Let me try to explain this to you in a way that you people can understand.
"You people"?

- Hey, hey.

Just trying to figure out what the fuck was with "you people."
All right, now, look.
Leave law enforcement to the police.

And you guys just do the jobs that I hired you to do.
You remember?

- Splish, splash.

Now I gotta go clean up this mess that you made.
Boom.
CAPTAIN THORPE:

BRODY:

Because I don't know, man, it looks clear to me.
Nice and quiet.
MITCH:

Flynn's Seafood Company.
What about Flynn's Seafood Company?
They're the ones who supply all the fish to the Huntley Club, right?
- So?

I saw barrels like that down in the Huntley, and now they're on the back of her yacht.
BRODY:

My gut says there's some bad shit going on over there, and my balls say we need to go over there and check it out.
- Yeah.

'Cause my balls say,
(HIGH-PITCHED) "Hey, just take it easy right here.

Why the fuck do your balls sound like three-year-old girls?
I don't know, man.

But they're wise.
MITCH:

(MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
Dude, we are penetrating the shit out of this place.
No, I think it's "infiltrate."
That's what we want to do.

BRODY:

That's why we're going undercover.
Undercover?

Remember.

Undercover, yeah.

(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Check it out.

Yeah.

Why the fuck are you wearing makeup, dude?
What do you mean, why the heck am I wearing makeup?
- It's a little much.

Well, what we're supposed to do is find the fucking flakka.
- Oh, my God.

You are so selfish.
You think this was easy?
MITCH:

But please shut the fuck up and focus.
(MEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
Come on.
(BRODY GRUNTS)
- Holy shit.

Can't believe Leeds is doing that shit during the day.
(EXCLAIMS IN SHOCK)
Yeah.

BRODY:

It's like Breaking Bad in there.
Yeah, dude, Breaking Bad.
- You were right.

(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
EMT 1:

- I got here.

- Yep.

EMT 2:

(CELL PHONE RINGING)
EMT 2:

Yeah, this is the police.

Ellerbee, you got to get down to the Huntley ASAP.
We found the drugs.
Yeah, that sounds great, Mitch, but right now I'm busy dealing with another dead body.
Oh, and this one's on your beam Did you hear that?
First a councilman and now a shark attack.
That's crazy.
Lifeguard coming through.
You're still calling this your jurisdiction, right?
We haven?

But this has get to be connected to the Huntley.
We found the drugs here.

Mitch, it's Thorpe, your boss.
Look, stop with the Huntley crap, okay?
And don't even come down here.

Just meet me back at headquarters.
Right now I gotta deal with your new publicity nightmare.
Fuck!
NEWSREADER:

But in the wake oi the recent death of Councilman Rodriguez, the locals here want answers.
CAPTAIN THORPE:

I don't even know what to say.
Whose shift was it?
- Sir, it was mine.

And where were you?
Stalking one of the most prominent women in Emerald Bay?
Blatantly disregarding your jurisdiction?
Sir, I only stepped away to check out the Huntley
- and find the flakka.

I warned you about sticking to your job.
This wasn't even Mitch's fault.
You leave me no choice.
You're done.
I want you off the beach.

(CHUCKLES) Whoa, whoa, whoa.

BRODY:

You can do this in your sleep.
That's not what I'm saying.

You have two gold medals, okay?
You're like the Stephen Hawking of swimming, minus the total paralysis pan.
Unless you want me to replace you with someone else.
With all due respect, that job should go to Stephanie Holden.
She knows the bay better than anyone.
I'm no longer interested in your opinion, Buchannon.
Dismissed.
Brody.

Okay, it's just me and you now.
If you can help me keep your new pals in line,
I can make sure that you stick around here for a long, long time.
And if you don't, your probation could get fucked up.
- Good talk, Brody.

You're my dawg, right?

Bring it in.
(SOFTLY) I fucked it up.
Turn in your trunks, Mitch.
(EXCLAIMS)
(CLEARS THROAT)
I'm going to go.
What, you think that I wanted this?
- It kinda looks like you did.

If anyone should get the job it should be Stephanie.
No shit.

What would you have done?
I wouldn't have taken the job, even if they'd offered it to me.
It was not an offer, it was a trap.
Guys, guys, come on.

All right?

Bieber here figure out why there's a dead body on our beach, and how Leeds is bringing in drugs to the bay.
(SIGHS)
Good luck.
Mitch.
Yo, Mitch!
I'm sorry.
I want you to have something.
My mentor gave me this.
It's the keys to Lifeguard Tower One.
Your new post.
No.

I'm not ready for this, man.
They need you.
(SIGHS)
STEPHANIE: (OVER PHONE) Hi, Mitch.

Uh, please call us back.

(MAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
(MITCH WHISTLING)
BOY:

(POP BALLAD PLAYING)
Excuse me, ma'am...
(OVER C.B. RADIO) Yo, Mitch.

I hit you on the 0.3, so I know you're listening.
1 hope you haven?

Everyone says hi.

I could really use your help, brother.
(MUSIC CONTINUES)
You know, well, it all depends on the data plan that you want.
Internet, everything like that?
Oh, it's all fantastic with the Internet, sure.
It's Internet-savvy in function
- and there's broadband...

You gotta have that.

Samsung has all the capabilities of the I.T. process, and, uh...
THE MENTOR:

What are you doing here?
I'm here to remind you who you are.
(SOUL MUSIC PLAYING)
Come on, buddy.
Snap out of it!
(RECORD SCRATCHES)
Shoes?
You're wearing worker man shoes?
Really, how far have you fallen?
- Far.

- Mitch?

Come on, man.
You don't just protect the bay.
You are the bay.
Mitch, the bay needs you.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
Hey, do you guys know of any good bars around here?
Hey, do you guys know where you can rent a bike?
GIRL 2:

- This way?

Not too far away.
GIRL 1:

Sand grifters.
(SEAGULL SQUAWKING)
(BOTH GRUNT)
Get the fuck out of here!

MAN:

WOMAN:

Hey.
You guys want to help me figure out whose stuff this is?
Yo, this cooler is...

Yo, Ellerbee?
What's up, man?

Oh, Lieutenant Brody!

Black market organs from the Boogie Board Bandits?
(LAUGHING) Oh, you mean this?
No, no.
This is actually for you.
You see, I'm not Mitch, right?
I know my place.
I'm just a lifeguard.

I just want to make sure that you and I start out on the right foot.

So I went ahead and got something a little bit special for you.
Which is a double-chocolate smoothie from Chen's.
- A double-chocolate smoothie?

- From Chen's?

You know, I shouldn't.
But it is my cheat day.
- It's your cheat day.

Exactly.
And by the way, I went ahead and added that extra protein for you, dawg.
Oh, my man.
I know you're trying to keep up.
(LAUGHS) Yeah, man.
(SLURPING)
(CHUCKLES)
BRODY:

Hey, Summer.
(PANTING)
Come on, Summer.
I think I found something big here, okay?
I really need your help.
Please?
You took marine biology, right?
Yeah.
Look at these.

Do these look like shark bites to you?
SUMMER:

No, they don't all look like shark bites.
Hey, let me take a look.
(GAGS)
Oh, God, I can't deal with blood.
I mean, that one might be.
Those definitely are not.
So they could be, like, knife wounds.
Yeah, maybe.
(GAGGING)
Oh, my God, that's Dave!
- Oh, my God.

Hey, stop looking at the picture, dude.
Ronnie, Ronnie, what did you just say?
- That's Dave.

I used to work with him.
What do you mean?

(STAMMERS) Tech stuff.
- You wouldn't understand.

What kind of tech stuff?
Holy shit!

Dave told me that he was working with Leeds on something for the Huntley.
Oh, my God.

Both of these bodies were dead before they hit the water.
Mitch got set up.
Leeds got rid of him and we're probably next.
Shit.
Ronnie, um, I need your help.
- No.

- No.

- Uh-uh.

- Okay, fine.

Because as much as I know about laptops,
I don't know shit about computers.
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)
(COMPUTER BEEPING)
Uh, so Dave had access to Leeds's server.
Uh, her server, you mean her network.
Yeah, her network.

Okay.

Get into her cloud and then steal all her cookies, right?
And then we're...

Straight through the firewall.

Literally none of what you said made any sense.
Straight over the firewall.
It's not like a physical thing you do.
Okay, I don't know what I'm talking about here, dude.
- Just...

It's been done this entire time?
- Yeah, man.

We found a lot of dirt.
Drug dirt, real estate dirt, yacht dirt.
"Dirt"?
What the hell are we supposed to do with dirt, Ronnie?
I meant evidence.
- Oh, evidence.

Well, why didn't you say so, man?
- Heck, yeah!

I'm really proud of you, man.
Guys, we did some digging.
And Mitch was right.
The Huntley is a front for a giant drug operation.
But I figured out it's not about drugs for Leeds, ifs about real estate.
And she's planning on making the entire bay private.
- Yeah, but the town would never let her.

Because she has every single politician in this town on her payroll.
Rodriguez, the taint guy.
- What about the business owners?

Well, most of them sold out and signed away their properties.
Leeds blackmailed the ones who didn't and used Dave to help hack into their accounts.
I mean, she's like some sort of modern-day J. Edgar Hoover.
The vacuum guy.
No.
But there was one holdout.
- Who?

And if anything happens to him, his property goes back to the city.
Who do you think they're gonna sell it to?
- We have to warn him.

- No one's seen him for days.

But Leeds is having a party on her yacht tonight.
I guarantee you, she found a way to get that guy into her boat.
Which is why we're gonna go to that party.
What?
Summer, you and I are going to find the flakka.
You guys find Chen.
Will it work?

Will there be some surprises along the way?
Abso-fucking-lutely.
Is anyone going to die?
(SIGHS) I don't know.

Sorry, what'?
But we are Baywatch.
We save lives.
I know because you guys saved mine.
Let's go kick that bitch's ass.
- Let's do it.

(CLUB MUSIC PLAYING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
Thank you.
- Lifeguards, this is a surprise.

Victoria, we wanted to come here in person and tell you how excited we are to be working with you instead of against you, now that, um...
- Now that...

He's gone, so all we care about now is protecting the bay.
And we know you feel the same.
Oh, I do.
I always knew I liked you two.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
- Enjoy the party.

Well, someone has to.
What?

Listen, I know where the flakka is.
What, where?

Yeah.

Please don't die.
Do you think we should kiss?
I think we should kiss.
Otherwise, we may never know what it was like.

Maybe we should talk about it later.
It was worth a try.
- It was a good try.

(EXHALES)
Okay.
Don't do anything too stupid.
I won't.
(CLANGS)
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
(SIGHS)
(GASPING)
Summer.

Yeah, hey.
She's been smuggling ii under the boat this entire time.
- No shit?

Okay, yeah.
But Mitch hasn't answered the phone since he was fired.
Ah, fuck.
The C.B.!

- He's always listening on the CB.

Tell him, Brody found the flakka and that he needs to meet us at the marina at 0900.
0900 is 9:00 a.m., so 9:00 p.m. would be 2100.
That system is so stupid and flawed.
Okay, well, militaries use it all over the world.
But I'll tell him 2100.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
(WHISPERS) Hey, guy's
STEPHANIE:

(PANTING)
Mitch, if you can hear me, you were right.
We found the drugs on Leeds's boat.
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
Shit!
Hey.

Then I guess that means that you and I are all alone.
And you look like a bad boy.
How about we get into some trouble?
(GAGS)
Too much champagne.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Miss?
(GRUNTS)
Stephanie!

Chen!
- (MUFFLED GRUNTING)

- Are you okay?

- It's okay.

What the fuck is going on?
(SOFTLY) Shit.
Put your hands where I can see them.
- (GRUNTS) - (C.J. EXCLAIMS)
- Whoa!

- Summer!

Did I kill him?
No, you just knocked his ass out.
Oh, thank God.
Here's the key.

- All right, guys, Brody found the flakka.

And let's get you out of here and call Ellerbee, okay?
- What about Leeds?

- What?

Okay, yeah, we will.
(STUTTERS) We're going to be on the villain's boat.
Whoo!

(THUDS)
If I could please have your attention.
By this time tomorrow, the expansion of the Huntley will be official.
(ALL CHEER AND APPLAUD)
But for now, let's enjoy the caviar, the champagne and the fireworks.
Cheers.
We have a problem.
Aw...
Wrong time to grow a conscience, Brody.
Chen's getting away.
How is Chen getting away?
- Fucking idiots!

They're trying to trap us.

Get the chopper to meet us at the barge.
We need to get the fuck outta here.
What do we do about him?
Do what you were supposed to do with Chen.
SUMMER: (OVER RADIO) We got Chen off the boat.
Do you guys have eyes on Brody?
No, we still haven't seen him...
- What!

Wait!

Bad news.
She's got Brody in a cage on the back of a boat.
- Oh, my God.

Wakey-wakey, pretty little dum-dum.
Such a shame.
Why'd you have to go snooping?

Maybe Thorpe was wrong about you after all.
What?
Thorpe?

Oh, you haven't figured that part out yet.
Where I bribed him, you know, got Mitch fired, put your dumb ass in charge.
All you had to do was be a lifeguard.
Get a tan.
(GUN COCKS)
But instead, you tried to be like Mitch and save the bay.
Now let's see how long you can hold your breath.
No, just listen to me.

God...

- No!

You're fucking crazy.
If I was a man, you'd call me "driven."
- No!

You have to listen to me!
VICTORIA:

(MUFFLED SHOUTING)
(MUFFLED GROANING)
(BOAT ENGINE WHIRRING)
(SOFT POP BALLAD PLAYING)
(BRODY EXCLAIMS)
(MUFFLED) What the fuck?
(CHUCKLES)
Damn it, brah!
Fuck!
(BRODY CONTINUES EXCLAIMING)
(BOTH GASPING)
(COUGHS)
- Thank you.

Leeds is gonna escape in a helicopter on that fireworks barge.
- Not if we stop her first.

(GRUNTS)
Come on, buddy.
How'?
Watch and learn.
Ronnie, come in.
RONNIE:

(MITCH AND RONNIE LAUGH)
Yeah, he's alive and he's well.
Ronnie, I need you to figure out a way to launch those fireworks.
Listen to me.
I want you to light up the sky.
- Okay.

That's got to be her boat up there!
- There's the console.

Okay.

(GASPS)
Oh, fucking lifeguards!
What a nuisance!

- What the fuck'?

PILOT: (OVER RADIO) Miss Leeds, I'm approaching the barge.
Hi meet you at the top.
RONNIE:

Holy shit.
- She's gonna get away!

Ronnie, C.J., right now.

Um, yeah, yeah, Mitch.

I've never seen any interface like this.
I don't know what to fucking do!
Hey!

You are the tech guy.
- You are the motherfucking tech guy.

(PANTING)
- I'm the motherfucking tech guy.

MITCH:

All right, let's go.
I'm behind you, dude.
All right, watch your step.

What, the ones that kill you?
Let's go, partner.
I like the sound of that.
Shit!
What the fuck!
Uh...

- And I'm in.

Holy shit!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
It's working, he's turning!
- It's go time.

(EXHALES)
What the hell is taking you so long?
PILOT:

Could you put that dog down already?
Second level!

RONNIE:

Whoo!
(BOTH GRUNTING)
(GRUNTING)
(YELLING) (GRUNTS)
(SCREAMING)
(GUNSHOT) (GRUNTS)
Mitch!
The fireworks are almost done.

Holy shit!
And come to this side, you imbecile!
Fire.
None of them are working anymore.

Oh, honey.

(GRUNTS)
- Mitch!

- Because of you.

You do realize I'm holding a gun, right'?
So impulsive.
That's why you walked right into my plan.
Leeds!
For fuck's sake.

Let the little boy go.
That's not how this story ends, Mitch.
You see, you're not here to save him.
After all, he took your job.
So you shot him.
But not before he got a shot off that killed you.
I don't know.

Yeah, that sounds cheesy.
You won't get away with this!
Oh, I already have, Mitch.
You know the best thing about winning is that you get to write the story of what happened.
Isn't that right, Mr. Gold Medal?
- Fuck you, lady.

What's that?
What the hell?
(STAMMERS) It's a big red button.
The big red button.
(POWERING UP)
(BEEPING)
Time to die, boys.
No!
I was born of the sea!
I eat fire coral and I piss saltwater!
- (GRUNTS)

(CHUCKLES) What the fuck?
(BEEPING RAPIDLY)
I'll die when the tide stops and the moon drowns!
Until then...
- (GRUNTS)

Go, baby.
I'm oceanic, motherfucker.
How tacky.
Mitch, you just blew her up!

Plus I'm high as a motherfucker right now on Devil's Urchin.
(GRUNTING)
You stabbed yourself with one of those?
I thought that was supposed to kill you.
It does.

And I'm in desperate need of medical attention.
(GROANS)
(FIREWORKS CONTINUE EXPLODING)
That wasn't so bad.
(SHRIEKING)
That's good luck.

- What?

- What?

(SIRENS WAILING)
What took you so long with Leeds?
(CHUCKLES) I didn't want to make it seem like it was too easy.
SUMMER:

Thank God you make us carry these.
Take it easy.
You saved your own life this time.
(SIGHS)
- Thank you.

Hey, um...
So I hear you were, uh...
You were right the whole time.

Owe you an apology.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
No apology needed.
I mean, we saved the bay.
So you can hit us on that shell phone anytime.
(ALL CHUCKLE)
Come on, brother.
- My man.

CAPTAIN THORPE:

What part of "You're fired" do you not understand, Mitch?
Get the fuck off my beach or I'll have you arrested.
Hey, Thorpe.
- (GRUNTS) - (ALL EXCLAIM)
- Oh!

Oh, my God.
This is our beach, bitch.

Ow.
That was a badass right cross, Brody.
You just said my real name.
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)
(SIGHS)
- Hey, killer.

(SIGHS)
Hey.
Morning.

Do you want breakfast?
- Okay.

Pancakes?

- Bacon?

Cinnabon?
- I saw you do that.

(STAMMERS) Yup, just the...

(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Good morning.
That was a hell of a punch, mister.
- Thank you.

Well, I told you I would learn better if I had a study buddy.
(CHUCKLES)
Don't get ahead of yourself.
Oh, my God.

Look at my dick?
Now we're even.
(LAUGHS)
Oh, my God.
We're late.

I found something.
- How'd you get this?

You only threw it eight feet, dude.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Thank you.
You're welcome.

Uh, guys, after finding the drugs, helping save Chen and helping me blow up the bad girl with a Roman candle, ifs a pleasure to say you are officially no longer trainees.
- Whoo!

Congratulations.
Yeah, guys.
MITCH:

I want to introduce you to our new captain who has been running our Hawaii division very successfully for years now.
The amazing Captain Casey Jean.
Is it just me, or is she in...
- In super-slow motion?

Wow.

That's how we roll.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(IN SLOW MOTION) Oh, fuck!
(MUSIC STOPS)
(SEAGULL SQUAWKING)
(MUSIC RESUMES)
- All right, here we go.

Yeah, we saw it in the coroner's...

Yeah, we saw it in the corn...

Coroners.

MAN:

I'm gonna get it.

Yes, we saw it in the coronary's report.
(ALL LAUGHING)
- Ronnie.

Stop looking at the donuts like that and dump them.
(ALL LAUGHING)
(BOTH LAUGHING)
- (ALL LAUGHING)

You're like a dolphin on cocaine, but not annoying at all.
You're like if a human fucked a jet ski...
Which is impossible, but it'd be so cool.
What?

Okay, I got this.
(GRUNTS)
- Come on, dude.

Because I'm fucking strong.

What do your balls say?
(HIGH-PITCHED) "Don't follow Mitch's balls.
"Mitch's balls be stupid."
(LAUGHING)
Your hidden balls want to go to the cartel?
- Right now.

My balls are talking...

Ugh.
I need you to check his taint for needle marks.
(SNICKERS)
(LAUGHS)
God damn it.
(ALL LAUGHING)
It's, uh...

God, it's getting really fro-y in here.
Smile.
- Love your chest, it is so...

Uh-huh. (EXCLAIMS)
- (LAUGHS)

It doesn't work when you say it back to me like that.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Hey, C.J., why do our suits ride so far up our asses?
It makes us faster in the water.
Did you just...

I hope that doesn't make the boob-lers...
All right.
I'd love it if you wore tighter pants.
- I really would.

Why do you get to play Mitch Buchannon?
You're joking.
No, I've been Mitch Buchannon for 20 years.
Am I gonna be in the sequel?
I think you should be in the sequel.
Do I look like a tiny little asshole next to him?
- MAN:
