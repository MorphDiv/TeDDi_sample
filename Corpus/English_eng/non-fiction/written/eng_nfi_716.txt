(lively symphonic music)
WOMAN:

Mike, can we chat with you for a minute?
- Yes.

How are you?

The brilliant Mike Scaggs is with me now, nominated for the award that everyone is talking about... best man at Josh's wedding.
What is up?

- How are you feeling?

There's some great dudes in this category.
Your friendship with Josh has been a smash hit.
How did you decide to get involved in the project?
You know, Josh first approached me about ten years ago.
Uh, at the time, I was at a party, slamming shots of Jager.
He walked up and was like, "Can I get in on that?"
I was like, "Hell yeah, bro."
Now, you must be nervous about tonight.
The way I see it, it's all up to the big man upstairs...
Josh.
ANNOUNCER:

(orchestral flourish)
Passion, preparedness, cool to hang with... these are the qualities of a best man.
And the nominees are...
Doug, "The Extra Beer."
Hey, man, they gave me an extra beer.
- Want it?

Tom, "The Lift to the Airport."
Josh?
Oh, we should probably get going.
All right.
(speaking indistinctly)
Nikhil, "The Life Saver."
- (dogs barking) - (yells)
- Oh, my God!

- (distorted) No!

- (groans)

- You saved my life.

You're my best friend.
When did that happen?
And, finally, Mike Scaggs,
"Ten Years of Friendship."
(cheerful guitar music)
BOTH:

- (cheering, applause)

And the best man goes to...
Mike Scaggs, "Ten Years of Friendship."
Come on!

- ANNOUNCER:

and first win as best man for Mike Scaggs.
(laughing) We did it, man!
- Yeah.

Oh, gimme this.

This is for every guy who's ever been told he is weird for hanging out with Josh.
To all those dudes, I'm living proof.
It is all worth it.

- (string music plays)

Uh, uh, okay.

We did it, Terry!

Oh, what...

Um, every day, four whales are killed, and that's way too many, so, uh, you know, donate to that shit.
I want to thank Cameron Crowe!

And I want to thank Josh!
He's my best friend in the whole wide world.
We've been through everything, brother.
- I love you, brother.

Okay.
- Yes.

(downtempo electronic music)
Aah!
(squeaks)
(growls)
Dude, I still can't believe you picked me
- to be your best man.

You know me better than anyone else.
True dat.

Yes, we will have two burritos, ultra nasty with extra drippings, butt blaster sauce, extra blasty, and a couple of thick-boy IPAs.
Ah, I'm-I'm trying to cut down on the butt blasting.
Uh, can I just get, like, a... maybe a fish taco
- and a bottle of water?

Yeah, right.

- Oh, my God.

I got food poisoning last time I was here.
Yeah, their meat is old.
Got your bachelor party all mapped out.
6:00 p.m., party starts.
8:00 p.m., blackout drunk.
10:00 p.m., blackout drunk again.
Midnight, party starts.
- What?

- Yeah.

- overwhelming.

- (laughing)

Eat that shit.
(groans)
You should probably get going soon to that strip club.
Traffic around the airport's always crazy.
Yeah, you're right. (sighs)
What's the matter?
I am just dreading this bachelor party.
I'm gonna be stuck there all night, unable to leave, and all I feel like doing is staying in with you
- and watching Shark Tank.

There's plenty of time to do that.
Relax, go hang out with Mike.
How bad could it be?
- (airplane flies overhead)

- Aah!

Aah!

- Whoo!

- Aah!

(all yelling) Whoohoo!
- Yeah!

Feels like it's probably got to be almost last call, right, boys?
No way, dude.

- It's what?

- and throw away the keys, baby.

Yeah!

- Can I, uh, make a phone call?

- But, Greenberg...

Be quick about it.
(foreboding music)
(melancholy string music)
(door slams shut)
- How you doing?

- How's life on the outside?

Uh, I just, uh, finished an episode of Shark Tank.
This guy pitched these socks that you can kinda draw on, so, like-like, you can, like, customize the socks and, like, write things on the socks... like, if you're on a team... (sobs)
Oh, God...
I'm sorry.

No, no, you... you need to live your life.
From now on, just pretend I'm dead.
Don't talk like that.
You don't know what it's like in here.
You don't know what it's like.
What's that mark on your face?
Josh, did someone hurt you?
- It's nothing.

A titty hit me in the face.
(sighs) Oh, Josh.
I don't suppose the, uh, governor's answered my letters.
- No.

Josh...

- (whispers) Hey, hey, hey...

You stay with me.

Listen to me, okay?
You do whatever you need to do to get through this, all right?
You do your shots, you take your lap dances, and you come home to me, all right?
But, Josh, don't do anything stupid, okay?
Aah!

Greenberg!

- Yeah.

- Oh, no, I am-I am here...

And-and having, uh, lots of fun.
That's what I like to hear.
Bartender, give us five of your grossest shots.
We want the shit nobody buys.
- (cackles) - (all laughing)
Whoo!

Mm.
Yeah!

- Where's Josh?

Joshie!
Josh.
Josh!
God damn it, where is he?

(bottle clatters into distance)
What the hell?
(whispers) No.
Josh?

(roars) Josh!
Hey, man, could we go ahead and cut the cake?
- (whispers) Whatever.

I'll start the traditional way by separating the two halves.
(melancholy piano music)
Perfect.
Okay, great.

Tom will be here.

The bridesmaids are here.
Uh, looks like the only thing I need now is the best man.
- Yeah.

Uh, no, no, he... he still hasn't made it yet.
Okay, so wait.

Ah, you know him, he's...

He's probably just hungover.
I thought you guys quit at, like, 10:30 last night.
I-I...

It's a possibility they might have gone a teensy bit longer.
- Josh, you bailed?

- I did not bail.

Yeah, okay, they think I did.

Who cares about some stupid party?
Who wants to see the bachelorette party pictures?
- Oh, my God, me, me, me, me, me.

But also the most important.
It cemented our friendship forever.
Guys, I feel the exact same way.
I know we made you do a few things
- that made you uncomfortable.

And the significance of that was not lost on us.
Yeah, I feel like this conversation could probably happen some other time.
Lucy, we love you.

- Oh, for (bleep) sake.

Aw.

- (squeals cheerfully) - (giggles)
(whimpering)
Okay, I get it.

I'm sorry I left early.
But it's not a big deal.
Mike doesn't hold grudges.
(eerie string music)
Aah!
(dramatic orchestral music)
(ominous musical flourish)
All right, Nana, there you are.
- You're all set.

Joshie, we may have a teensy little issue.
- What?

But while we have a seat for him, we don't have any for his henchmen.
For his-his henchmen?

(cackling)
(sinister music)
Okay, boys, it's showtime!
- Go get him, boss.

Who the (bleep) are these guys?
Mike, are you... are you all right?
Never better, Joshie boy.
Sorry to crash your little party.
Well, you didn't crash it.

It's...

- (cackling)

Ah, champagne.

- That's kinda wasteful.

(screeching)
- Can you please just calm down?

(chuckles) Toasts.
"A" is for "amour," which Josh and Lucy truly feel.
"B" is for "belonging."
That's right.

(laughs) Yeah.

- Who are you?

- Their new journey has begun.

Length is the least of your worries, Joshie boy.
This card's about your herpes scare.
- Oh, my God.

- Why?

(ominous musical flourish)
Mike, you're being an asshole, okay?
You're gonna ruin my rehearsal dinner.
- You ruined my bachelor party!

But can you really blame me?
Who the hell wants to get blackout drunk
- at a shitty strip club?

Yeah, used to!

I don't like doing that shit anymore.
Yeah, or is it that you just don't like me anymore?
Why are you so hung up on this?
It was just a party.
No, it wasn't just a party, man.
It was our last chance to hang out, and you left without even saying good-bye.
- (sighs)

"Z" is for "Zarathustra,"
which I think speaks for itself.
(scattered applause)
Are there any other toasts?
Please...
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna ruin any more of your life.
I... (sighs) Mike...
Mike, can I talk to you without your neon beatniks?
Mike?
(sighs) Hi.

I'm-I'm really, really sorry, man.
I mean it.

Just please call me back, please.
- (sighs)

- Hi.

Uh, no, no, I think he's still pretty upset.
Well, you know what?

He's gonna forgive you.

(dramatic music)
MIKE:

I have decided to retire as Josh's best friend.
Mike, how can you just walk away?
You're the greatest ever, and you're still in your prime.
Had a great career, you know, set a lot of best friend records... most consecutive hangs, also grossest bare-ass fart to Josh's face.
It's one I believe may never be broken.
Uh, but there's more to life than being Josh's best friend.
Yeah, I want to spend time with my family, explore some business opportunities, and also pursue my other lifelong dream.
- What dream?

(all gasping and murmuring)
I am thrilled to announce that I have just signed a minor league, non-guaranteed contract with the Chattanooga Mud Dogs.
With any luck, I will accomplish just as much in baseball as I did being Josh's best friend.
- Thank you.

- Thank you, Mikey.

I didn't know Mike played baseball.
I mean, he played softball at middle school, and he was terrible.
Okay, um...

Josh, Josh, this is important, okay?
(bright acoustic guitar music)
- Go to Chattanooga.

(both sigh)
I love you!
Okay, hustle up, y'all!
Let's practice.
Practice makes perfect, right?
Ah, love me some drills, right, baby?
(pastoral music)
Doing a no-hitter today, right?
Come on, come on.

Come on.

(groans)
Mike!

Sure, kid, what do you got?

Nah, it's from your old days as Josh's best friend.
That was a good year.
Sorry, kid, I don't do that anymore.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to do batting.
All right, Guerrero, don't hold back!
- (grunts) - (clapping)
Yeah, nice... nice swing.
- What do you want?

Nothing to be sorry for, man.

We're both doing exactly what we were born to do.
You're marrying Lucy, and I'm playing baseball.
MAN:

Uh, I've probably done enough batting.
Mike, I-I totally believe you have exactly what it takes to be a professional baseball player.
- Obviously.

Dude, you don't, okay?

It's like I don't even know how to be your friend anymore.
Hey, you remember...

- Yeah, that was great.

Uh, and then I was like,
"I don't think I can do this anymore.
I'm literally gonna die from alcohol poisoning."
It was the end of an era, but it wasn't the end of us.
Why?

- of smoking pot every day.

God, it was hard at first.

But we stuck with it, and we eventually leveled out.
And-and if we can go through a huge change like that, what can't we deal with?
You came all the way to Chattanooga to tell me that?
- Yup.

Aren't you worried about missing the wedding?
No wedding without my best man.
Well, Coach, it's been a crazy ride.
It's no secret we didn't always see eye to eye, but even though I'm leaving the clubhouse today and I won't be there for the doubleheader against the Water Bears and the Sky Grizzlies,
I want you to know I will always consider Chattanooga my home, and I will always, always bleed Mud Dog blue.
So I guess what I'm trying to say is...
You're out.
(indistinct chatter)
BOTH:

(both laughing) Ah, they're gonna miss me.
Yeah, for sure.

Yeah, hey, I miss you too, buddy.
MAN:

Yeah.
(bright acoustic guitar music)
Pound it. (laughs)
Wow, cool, there's a poster of us?
Yeah, man.

- I'd love one.

I'm making a movie with Bugs Bunny...
Uh, okay, excellent.

Liz will be there, and then, uh, the best man, my best man, will be on that spot right there.
Uh, w-what if I don't hit my spot?
- Does it have to be exact or...

Just kinda know your general area.
Right, right, right, got you.
Uh, and then the music begins, you'll walk down the aisle at a slightly slower-than-normal pace.
- Okay, like this?

No, no.

- um, deliberate.

- what if I blow it?

- (sighs)

- Okay.

- (gentle acoustic guitar music)

♪ Ooh ♪
Hey, I've been meaning to ask you, when did Nikhil get shot?
Oh, I never told you that story?
- No!

So last month in Caracas...
