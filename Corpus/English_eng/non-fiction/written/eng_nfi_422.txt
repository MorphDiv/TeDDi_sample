Are you seeing this?

They're gonna know we were here.
That's why I'm changing the grades on the backup server.
And that helps us how?
Once I zero out the local drives, they'll have no choice but to restore them from the backups.
Yada, yada, yada, new grades in place.
No sign we were here.

The cops are here!
Like, not the campus cops, the real cops!
Oh, God... they've entered the building.
We have to go.

- Just give me a minute.

(KEYBOARD CLACKING)
Let's go, guys, come on.
Agh!
Uhh!

The cops saw us.

This is so, so bad.
Actually, this is very, very good.
See, now we know the true police response time, so if we account for that here and adjust the other variables accordingly, booyah.
- Next time, we'll...

Oh, God.
Well, you did it.

A bunch of dumb college kids just trespassing on campus as dumb college kids are wont to do.
Now, you could take us down to the station, I get that.
Fill out all that boring paperwork, but for what?
I mean, it's a silly misdemeanor.
So why don't we just chalk this up we just being out here...
- Agh!

Uhh!

Dr. Jekyll and Agent Reade.
(CHUCKLING)
(SNORTING)
Nikki, I gotta get ready.
You feel ready to me.
Shepherd looked me right in the eye.
Just before...
There was nothing you could do.
That's the problem!
I mean, Shepherd goes where she wants.
Does what she wants.
Kills who she wants!
There's nothing that we can ever do.
Well, not entirely.
She didn't count on us finding Clark.
She killed him because he knew something.
Clark was lucid for a second.
He mentioned something about "The Truman Protocol."
Does that mean anything to you?
No... but, look, I'll look into it.
Uh, in the meantime...
Property records.
For Ellen Briggs.
WELLER:

Meaning Roman and I might have lived there, too.
We need to send you and Roman to every one of these addresses.
See if any of them trigger anything that leads us to Shepherd.
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

What are you doing back here already?
I'm okay...

All the more reason to get checked out psychologically.
An okay person doesn't collapse at work.
I had to come in today.

You solved a new one?
Actually, this one solved itself.
By design, this tattoo had to be solved today.
How is that possible?
There's an equation hidden in the tattoo.
Its variables correspond to real-world economic values... stock prices, commodities, futures.
This morning, for the first time, the equation balanced out.
- So something is about to go down.

I'm not sure yet, but I'm pretty sure it involves lithium.
In order for this equation to work, its market price had to pass an all-time high.
What's so special about lithium?
It's the main component in all modern high-capacity batteries.
Everything from smart phones to electric cars.
Lithium powers the things that power everything.
It's quickly becoming the new oil.
But what about the tattoo itself?
It's the seal for a secret society at Jameson College called Daedalus.
The smart guy from Greek mythology.
Made Icarus's wings, right?
Stop looking at me like that when I know things.
Pretentious college kids and lithium.
That does not add up.
Maybe they're mixing it with Jaeger and doing shots?
(CHUCKLES) All right, how secret is this secret society?
Very... members have a strict code of silence, but a partial list of alumni was leaked a few years back.
NAS:

Fortune 500 CEOs, a couple of senators.
Even a former chairman of the Federal Reserve.
WELLER:

And Gord Enver.
Yeah, I thought you might like that one.
Why does that sound familiar to me?
Please tell me we don't need to bring him in.
We need a member who will talk.
And no one likes talking more than Rich.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
ZAPATA:

Looks like someone found religion.
JANE:

Children, let us pray.
You've got to be kidding me.
(WHISPERED PRAYER)
Bless this mess.
You done?
We need to ask you for a little help.
Say no more.
With a case.
I'd love to help you, but, uh, I'm actually pretty busy trying to investigate the spiritual plane and reclaim my tattered soul from eternal damnation.
We have some questions about Daedalus.
True answers come from within, Jane.
Cooperate... and we can make your incarceration far more comfortable.
What can you offer the man who wants for nothing?
WELLER:

Every home is a prison.
Every prison a home.
I have no home, ergo, I have no prison.
So your religion is Fortune Cookie.
It's easier to hide behind simple jokes...

Just tell us what this is.
How'd you get this?
What is the formula doing on your body?
What do you mean?

(HANDCUFFS CLINKING)
Okay, off the record, it's an old Daedalus tradition.
It's a risk-reward algorithm we use to determine which risky activity is actually worth the risk.
Cheating on tests, shoplifting... unprotected sex... you know, the fun stuff.
But some alumni have actually taken to using it in their post-college lives to justify some pretty shady business dealings.
Like becoming a dark web kingpin.
Let he who is without sin...
Please focus, Rich.
WELLER:

Oh, Gott im Himmel.
This is bad.

What's bad, Rich?
Koran Surah 5:101.
"Do not ask about things which, if they are shown you, will distress you."
I'm already distressed!
What does it mean?
Matthew 24:7.
And nation will rise against nation, kingdom against kingdom.
This permutation of the formula determines the optimal time to start an armed conflict.
And, according to these numbers, that time is today.
What are you saying, Rich?
Call your family and tell them you love them.
Because this is a formula to start a war.
♪♪
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull Improved and Resynced for AMNZ WEBRip by zer0_
Basically, Rich is right.
There's nothing basic about it...

The formula's been tweaked to determine at what point lithium becomes so expensive that it's more cost effective to just, you know, invade another country and take theirs.
- WELLER:

All major conflicts begin with a catalyst, a casus belli, if you will.
Anyone can start a war if they find the right spark.
And blame it on the right country.
See?

So what's the attack, and which country's getting framed for it?
And which members of Daedalus are involved in the conspiracy?
How should I know?

Okay, so you're gonna pontificate?
Start waxing poetic on who else we should look at in Daedalus.
Zach Riley.

You know Zach Riley?
Know him?

The guy who wants to colonize the moon?
Oh, he's more than just the moon guy.
His software, RileyShare, was practically the birth of digital music distribution.

Now he's a major player in everything from artificial intelligence to electric cars.
He's also a major ass-hat, okay?
It's like me, but without the wit or the looks or the char...

It's not a good comparison, okay?
- Imagine...

Electric cars are powered by lithium.
There...

So if the U.S. invade the right country, they could save him billions.
I want to know where Zach Riley is, right now.
Anyone else in Daedalus that we should know about?
Well, there's probably one guy I should mention.
No.

You didn't tell me he would be here.
I... if this is another one of your schemes to get me back, I swear...
I had nothing to do with this.
- (SCOFFS)

Don't talk to me, don't look at me...
Don't look at you?

I'm a changed man because of you.
You made me wanna be a better human.
Okay, so... uck!

Lovely to see you as well.
(SIGHS)
All right, guess where Zach Riley is right now.
Back at Jameson College, an honoree for the winter carnival.
That makes sense...

It's, uh, designed to help safeguard their secrecy.
At some point during the carnival, they'll have a members-only cocktail party at The Labyrinth.
The what?
Daedalus's clubhouse on campus.
JANE:

Find out who Riley's conspiring with and when the attack's gonna happen.
Good luck... groups a lot scarier than the F.B.I.
have tried that and failed miserably.
Why go in as F.B.I. when we got two card-carrying members right here?
- WELLER:

Uh, no, just give me the death penalty.
Oh, my God, how many times do I have to say I'm sorry?
Once!

Enough, you two!
Can members take a date to this party?
I mean, it's been a while since I've been available to attend,
- but, uh, yeah, they sure used to.

You'll go separately with a plus one.
That way, have twice the eyes and ears in there.
I'm sorry, but... why would I help any of you?
'Cause I can transfer you to Victorville.
That's 85 miles from your parents in L.A.
I know it's been a little hard for them to travel, so this way, they'll be able to visit you more often.
- As for you, Rich...

The Talmud states that whoever saves a life, it is considered as if they saved an entire world.
Stopping this war will save thousands of lives, and therefore, thousands of worlds.
That's quite enough for me.
♪♪
JANE:

You need me out there.
No, right now, it's a recon mission.
All right?

Nas will take you and Roman to all of Shepherd's old residences.
See if any of them trigger any memories.
Are you sure?
- PATTERSON:

I'm allowed to, it's mine.
Yeah... uh...

All right?

So, please, find out.
Yeah, okay.
We have to infiltrate Daedalus, get a pulse on Riley, and stop this attack.
So, Boston and Rich, they can get us into The Labyrinth.
Patterson, are you up for some field work?
- Yes.

You're with Boston.
Uck, Agent Granny Panties?
Oh, it's not exactly Comic-Con for me, either, dude.
She knows this world.
And her tech skills could come in handy.
Rich...

Which one's Tasha?
WELLER:

(WINCES) No offense, but I don't think anyone's gonna buy Suzy-Frowns-A-Lot as my plus one.
And, really, there's only one person in the whole F.B.I.

Why do I keep coming back to you?
So what happened between you and Rich?
He, uh, got sober in prison and realized you were the worst person ever?
I don't want to talk about it.
So is there a Mr. Boring Lab Coat in your life?
I don't wanna talk about it.
WELLER:

All right, Riley went into The Labyrinth 20 minutes ago.
All right, let's get eyes on him as fast as we can.
See who he's talking to.
Uh, guys, these don't look like typical college bouncers.
Only the penitent man shall pass.
All right, well, now you're just quoting "The Last Crusade."
Mmm!
No!
No, Gord Enver is not welcome here.
Phineas Gilmartin!
How dare you come back here after what you did?

Phineas, you're not still mad about that?
- Good-bye, Gord.

To err is human, to forgive is...
Fellas, I'm a member here.

Okay, um, well... what if I were to tell you that he is a, uh, huge racist?
How 'bout that?

You do realize getting inside that building is a matter of national security.
- So... what haven't you told me?

Okay, I maybe kinda-sorta forgot to mention that I'm kinda-sorta persona non grata around here these days.
Hey, now we can go check out the carnival.
Huh?

Riley is about to start a war.
It's a bit hard to stop from out here.
There may be another way.

People forgot about these tunnels once Prohibition ended.
But I used to use them to sneak all kinds of other things into The Labyrinth.
Hookers, Kurt, I'm talking about hookers.
I mean, if you're gonna push to be uncouth, you know.
Why does Phineas hate you so much?
Apart from the obvious.
Oh, I took apart his BWM and then reassembled it on the roof of his dorm.
I don't know why he got so upset.
I'm the one that almost got expelled.
Hey, what gives?

Let's go.
So you're telling me your plan was to steal a bunch of radioactive crap and then detonate a dirty bomb at your alma mater?
One of my partners was supposed to unlock this, but he's indisposed, so... get to hacking!
This is not a good plan, okay?
I mean, no offense, but everyone's gonna know it was an inside job.
Actually, they'll figure it was him.
A Bolivian rebel with an axe to grind against the U.S., killed while stealing some pretty scary stuff.
Bolivia.
A lithium-rich country.
With a government... about to collapse.
Thad, come on.

You dick around with pharmaceutical prices, not war!
Business is business, and thanks to my recent acquisition of Riley motors, business just got very, very good.
- Zach sold to you?

Lithium was getting too expensive, but we're not gonna have that problem.
No, but the F.B.I.'s already onto you.
They're gonna know the truth.
Once this bomb goes off, the truth isn't gonna matter.
Tomorrow morning, when an entire U.S. city is glowing red, nobody's gonna care what a couple of Feds and their pet rat have to say.
Now hack!
I'm sorry, but my Buddhist teachings prohibit me from contributing to violence.

You shot me in the foot!
Next time, I aim higher.
Okay, okay.

Benjamin Oren's still unconscious.

- Doesn't know much.

- He ran, again.

I found this on Oren.
READE:

I don't know, but I recognize the letters.
Riley School of Alternative Energy.
The school has a hazardous materials containment system.
Right here on campus.
- How hazardous?

We figured out who Oren was texting with.
Thad Munson... they just pinged Thad's phone at the school of alternative energy.
He's there right now with Rich.
We got the key... so Thad's using Rich to break out this nuclear material.
They're not here to plan an attack.
They're here to execute one.

Reade, Tasha, anything on your floors?
- READE:

Patterson, get a local PD to help us lock down The Labyrinth until we know who else is involved.
Call in HAZMAT and pray to God that we don't need them.
No!

Oh-kay...
Munson, let him go.
Turn around, Fed, or your Buddhist friend here gets his third eye!
Third eye is actually a Hindu...
BOTH:

I'm sorry, Rich.
I can't let him get away with that container.
That's okay, why are you apologizing to me?
- I don't know why...

- (GUNSHOT)

- Put the gun down.

- (RICH GROANING)

Strontium's been contained.
- Send me an ambulance.

Rich has been shot.
Twice.
You shot the hostage.
Your obsession with the movie "Speed" has become very unhealthy.
(GROANING)
(SIREN BLOOPS)
You know, Boston,
I might actually miss you when you go to California.
Hmm.

You made this?
In a different life.
Well... it's incredible.
How does someone this talented become a criminal?
I followed my heart.
Stupid, right?
So what are the chances I get a full pardon now that I'm a national hero?
You do realize that your work with us is highly classified?
Well, don't I get a medal of some kind?
Purple Heart, Silver Star?
Redemption's its own reward.
Ah, stupid spiritual enlightenment.
Ow!

See ya.
What if I told you I could help you solve another tattoo?
What?

You don't think I know what you guys are up to?
What'll it cost us?
All I want is for Boston to be transferred to a minimum security facility.
The white collar kind.

Then, at the earliest possible chance, he gets out on good behavior.
Which religion is telling you to do this?
Actually, I was thinking of starting one of my own.
- That's terrifying.

How dare you.
So what have you got?
I may have done a little snooping around the Jane Doe files last time I paid you two a visit.
WELLER:

Recognize this?
Because I sure do.
Hey... um...
I've been reading Dr. Sun's file.
- Look...

I wanted to know why she left Zero Division.
Look, that file doesn't tell the whole story.
It says that she was there... when Sandstorm infiltrated your group.
And that she voiced concerns about the team member that later turned out to be compromised.
But no one listened to her.
I didn't listen.
Because you were too close to the mole?
How did you get over it?
That feeling of... being betrayed.
I...

And... and it cost me dearly.
But, look, Patterson, you still have a chance.
Talk to Dr. Sun.
Put Borden behind you.
(KEYS JINGLING)
Nikki?

You think Patterson will be pleased or pissed when she finds out Rich cracked a tattoo?
Pissed.
Definitely pissed.
Yeah.

Roman, did he... remember anything?
No.
It was worth a shot.
We'll find her.
Shepherd.
Yeah.
Wasn't so bad, out in the field today, with Rich.
Maybe he is finding his... soul.
Well, plus, you got to shoot him.
I wish you could have seen that.

(CHUCKLING)
I gotta go.
A hot date?
No, I...

Yeah, but it's not, you know, it's not... it's...
It's a date.

I'll see you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.

Tell me you have something on Truman Protocol.
It seems to be a series of meetings that took place in the '40s... in the buildup to the dropping of the A-bomb on Hiroshima.
So what has that got to do with Sandstorm now?
I don't know.
You know, I've been in the business of secrets for my entire life, and...
I've never encountered anything this buried.
You're telling me that every Truman Protocol file has been redacted?
No...
I'm telling you that there are no files.
That whatever the Truman protocol was, somebody has worked very hard to have it completely erased.
The F.B.I. was all over me today.
They were just after Munson and his crew.
Relax.

Some advance notice would be nice.
(CHUCKLING)
Shepherd's not big on notice.
You sure the F.B.I. knows nothing about our arrangement?
Well, not unless you said something.
I'd die before I told anyone.
Yes... or, failing that, afterwards.
