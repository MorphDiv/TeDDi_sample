DEAD!

Munk killed her?
It's not Munk, it's somebody Munk works for.
The problem is Yelburton!

Do what I told you.

You can help me.

Every morsel of that strength is needed for what I have to do, healing you would cost too much.
Jesus.

(SCREAMING)
You shouldn't have come.
Vladek is the one that's been cutting people up?
- Why has he taken Mum?

I have to take him.

Ah!
(BREATHING HEAVILY, GROANING)
AHH!
- (DAN GRUNTS) - (VLADEK PANTING)
Shaman.

(DAN WHIMPERING)
Also... healer.
AHHH!
And on this journey, your physical body will never leave this place.
But your spirit... will leave your body.
Yes, we've done this before.

A terrible pestilence came amongst the reindeer herders.
The same thing that happened at Fortitude.
The demon came amongst us.
You... you are that demon.

The strength to withstand pain, heal wounds, conquer and ravage or... cherish and protect.
I'm not your torturer.

We have to go on this journey together.

Are you ready?
Fuck you!
(DAN GROANS)
- (SOFTLY) Yes.

I...

(BREATHING SLOWLY)
(SHE BREATHES HEAVILY)
(CHUCKLES)
I was twelve.

All my life led to this, this one... this one moment when the boy became like the first shaman who was our mother.
You see only a woman is the most wise and powerful.
Feared by all demons, loved by all other shamans, but... her ritual is... is castration.
I...
I ran away.

After I shot Elena, I knew I was sick.
The madness coming over me.
Those things inside me, wasp larvae, eggs... the parasite.
In my flesh and in the space between the blood and the bones.
I fought it.

And I won.
You... you ran away.
(HE LAUGHS)
- (WIND GUSTING) - (CHAIN RATTLING)
FREYA!
I bring us together... before the Tupilaq.
In its meaning for us both.

Healer and the Demon.
Lazslo Hindemith.

Head full of madness.
That is the meaning he has for the Tupilaq.
A man on the run from greed and vengeance.
That is the meaning he has for the Sheriff.
My world and your world overlap.
The world of spirits and the world of men.

Magic and science.
Victim and murderer.
The heart of the Tupilaq is the heart of a killer.
Tomak who killed Bianca.

An innocent child.

The spine of a dog who came to me in trust.
An orca.

This is the most powerful magic.

What you... what you and I believe slide over each other.
In the tent.
That is where the meaning lives.
The tent.

That is where your choice lives.
Go inside the tent.
I...

You are there.
(PANTING)
- (WIND GUSTING) - (BABY COOS)
Lars... is yours.
Wha-what do you mean?
Dan?
(INAUDIBLE)
I-I can't hear what you're saying.
I can't hear you.
- (INAUDIBLE) - (FLAMES FLARE)
Too late...
(NATIVE MUSIC)
Freya, you did this?
You left me.

MUM!
Freya!
Freya!
You left me.

Come.

(BOTH GRUNTING)
AH!
Something is burning.
Yeah.
(GRUNTS)
(THRILLING MUSIC)
Dan!
Let's get him down!
Dan.
Dan!
(SHE GRUNTS)
(COUGHS AND GRUNTS)
(DAN SCREAMS)
Got him?

Come on.
She... collapsed.

- What's happened?

I'll...

Could I get some help?

(INDISTINCT)
All right.
They've found Freya!
- Where is she?

I'll go!
Natalie?

Fuck, what have you done?
Well it st... it started through the night.

Let me have a look.

They're very inflamed.
(CRYING) I just wanna claw my own eyes out like that Russian...
Okay.

- (GRUNTS)

(FREYA BREATHING HEAVILY)
Freya?

What's happening to you?

I... found him.
Found, found who, honey, found who?

He saved me.
W-what do you mean, saved you?

- You have to calm down!

Dad.
What?
With Freya's condition, this kind of exertion is dangerous.
Rest, peace and quiet.

- (FREYA BREATHING HEAVILY) - (MONITOR BEEPING)
Dad.

Vladek.
We'll find him, stop him.
Yeah, how's that?

There's just you and Petra.

Dan's been tortured by a maniac.
Petra can't find the car.
- What car?

Vanished.

Wherever she went, that's where she left it.
Come on, girl!

Who did this to you?
The shaman.

Murdered Tomak and Hindemith, fucking nailed me to a pit-prop.
Also drums and dancing.
We need to get you to the hospital.
You need stitches and pain killers.

No.

I need sleep now.
Be out of my body for a while.
Not over yet.
What the hell is he talking about?
I think we should get ready.
The bear that Michael Lennox killed.
The-the-the dead reindeer that me and Natalie found, the Russian soldier... all of them.

- And what happened to me is...

Please.

Please, you have to help me.

She says she's never felt pain like this before.
- She'd be better here.

These facilities, we could stabilise her, and together, we can run all the necessary tests much quicker than Adebimpe can.
- I should bring her here.

Okay.
Would you please not keep looking up at his office when I'm answering your questions about him.
I'm sorry, Ralfi.
(RALFI SIGHS)
You told Hildur where to find Munk?
That's right.

Waiting for Kim Hopperstad.
- Where is this sink-hole?

Now, would you please sign Hildur's condolences book as if that's what you came in here to do?
I'll sign it later.
They dragged him in an hour ago.
He's unconscious in a police cell.
Whoever took him drove nails through his hands.
And gave him some kind of drug, thank God.
Doctor Khatri, you better pray that he doesn't remember any of this!
He met her here.

Wherever this sink hole is.
And he kills her.
Murders her.
Where's the car?
There's nothing here.
I can see that there's nothing here!
Hildur saw right through Munk.
He had her fired, he made Eric the Sheriff.
Dad, everything you say may well be true, but right now, out here, with nothing to go on, it's all just speculation.
I have to pee.
DAD?

Dad, look here.
She met Munk.

He moved her body and he hid her car.
Oh, wait.

What?
- No.

- There's nothing there.

- (GRUNTS) - (WATER DRIPPING)
Munk didn't move her.

These sinkholes, they open up all... all the time around here.
The water from the hot springs runs right under here and on out into the bay...
Where we found her.
She confronted Munk, and then he pushed her in.
Or he threw her in after he killed her.
- That son of a bitch.

But we have no proof of any of this.
(SCOFFS) Proof!
You need proof.
Yeah.

Come on.

There's nothing we can do here.
We should be with Mum.

Michael.
(MONITOR BEEPING)
This is the end stage, Michael.
There's nothing I can do for Freya.
Soon she'll be safe in the arms of our Lord.
(MONITOR BEEPING)
- Oh, God.

- Hey, hey, hey, hey...

Let me go...!
It's okay!

Let me go!
It's okay.

- Okay?

It's time.
Get down on the floor now!
So is it your first time?

(RUNE AND YEVA LAUGHING)
Nobody is making any love to anybody.
Love doesn't enter into anything.

Hey.
I don't want to hear that kind of talk, neither does your mother.
You want to hear everything, don't you, Mum?

(THEY LAUGH)
All the ins and outs.
Hey!
(SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE)
First time I saw Yeva, it was in the forest.
(RUNE CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
I'm lost, Michael.
You found me in the snow.

Lifted me up, my love.
Everything else is nothing.
I love you, Michael.
Let me go now, please.
There's nothing you can do.
NO.
Mum.
(PETRA BREATHING DEEPLY)
He's here now?
Yes.

Interview strategy?
One thing I've been thinking... one thing I need you to help me with... let me check your gun.
What?
- Okay.

(DOOR BUZZES, SLAMS SHUT)
Let me out of here, Dan!

Dan!
(DIALING)
Gah!
Ingrid, it's me, come round here as fast as you can, this is all going really bad!
AH!
Spilt blood and broken bones.
I'm here... to bring you back.
Dan Anderssen.

You know what I've discovered?

I'm all the sheriffs there's ever fucking been.
I am always here when he comes.
My father, my grandfather, we are all the same.
We were always there and always will be there.
And the people you killed?
Those are only lives.

I am saving their souls.
And I'm your demon.
(WET CRUNCHING)
- (HE COUGHS) - (DAN BREATHING DEEPLY)
I took Elena's body from your father's house.
You can't know that!
You don't know that!
YOU'RE LYING!
HOW COULD YOU KNOW THAT?

Ralfi?

I'm in the police station, you have to come and let me out.
WHERE IS SHE NOW?

She's here.

El-Elena.

Tell me where Elena is.
She's here with us.

You can't escape her.
Speak to her, Dan.
You... you... speak to her.
Dan!
Speak... to me.
(IN ELENA'S VOICE) Dan.
Dan.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)
Here I am.
Where we started.
You and me.

You asked me if I felt safe in Fortitude.
And I thought it was...

Is Fortitude safe?
I don't know.

Maybe.

And now you are strong enough... to conquer it.
What thing?
It's not this boy who'll kill the demon.

It can only be you, Dan.
If you can see me in your heart, then you're Dan.
If you keep me there, you will always be Dan.
And Fortitude will be safe.
Only Dan.
Too late.
(THRILLING MUSIC)
(BLOWS LAND IN DISTANCE)
(KEYPAD BEEPS)
Eight.

Four.

He's killing him in there.
Stay here, Ralfi!

Okay.
DAN!

DAN!
PLEASE!
(GUNSHOT)
(GUNSHOT)
No!
Please, Dan.

(GUNSHOT)
I'll shoot you.
This is my choice.

From you.
(THRILLING MUSIC INTENSIFIES)
(MUSIC STOPS)
(MUNK SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY IN DISTANCE)
I have no idea!
I don't know if three people are enough to do this sort of work.
I...

(GUN COCKS)
No, don't speak to Khatri.

She's-she's unpredictable, she's irresponsible, i-it's her-her fucking fault we're in this mess.
What the fuck are you...
- End the call.

(PHONE CLATTERS)
(MUNK BREATHING RAPIDLY)
- Get away from the window.

This is a magnum and the bullet will go right through your guts and break the fucking window.
- I haven't got any proof.

You killed Hildur and I can't prove it.
Oh.

- I should just shoot you right now!

- That would make everything better.

Your wife's sick.

Yes.
What if I could help her?
I work for a company.

- What they have found...

Exactly what she needs.

Someone with altered genetic qualities.
Damaged tissues that can recover to original health.
A way to repair diseases.
The Russians, they had one, all those years ago, in that film we all saw.
But... didn't know what it was.
There is hope, Michael.
Speak to Khatri.

(GRUNTS)
He's DEAD.
He came to our town and did terrible things amongst us.
Brought blood and fear and madness.
So now he joins them all in death.

These are fully charged.

Might be too much clothing on the target, so aim for the face.
The darts are Fentanil.

Anybody gets in the way...
Who's the extraction?
You're gonna like this.

Anything we should know?
Bit of a character apparently.
Teeny little lights.
All gone, Hildur.
All your little lights.
(TEARING)
(GASPS)
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)
(MUSIC INTENSIFIES)
Now all the light is mine.
_
It was a blessing you stopped him.
A fucking blessing.
I know what it is.

There's nothing you can do for her.

Natalie, can you see... anything?

There's nothing else now.
