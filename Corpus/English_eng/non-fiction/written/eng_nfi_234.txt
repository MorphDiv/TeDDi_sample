- No!

But now Frankie's dead and Liam's terrified.
And now it's all going to come out.
Mate, your girlfriend is so fit.
- Clarissa, where did you find this?

I'm not surprised they were worried.

'I need to speak to Becky and she's blocked me.
'It's about her dad.'
- You're going to call her.

- Is Paul your boyfriend?

- We live together, but not like that.

I know where Liam is.

♪ Testator silens
♪ Costestes e spiritu
♪ Silentium. ♪
Liam?
Liam.
Liam?
Don't touch anything.
Stop!
Police!
DCI Underhill requesting assistance.

In pursuit of a suspect, over.
Cheer, guys.

You all right, mate?

- You all right?

- I'm really sorry.

- Sorry.

Liam opens the door, but keeps the chain on, because he's suspicious.
He was right to be.
Gunman shoots him through the crack... .. hits him in the shoulder.
He kicks the door in... but Liam, he's still mobile, stumbles away.
Now, someone, presumably Liam... .. smashes the bottle of beer -- mind the glass -- he crawls toward the back door.
Bullet wound to the right shoulder, another bullet caught him in the back of the knee.
And one to the back of the skull.
Looks like our gunman caught his clothing as he climbed over.
What is it?
Not just fibres.

Both boys in the video are dead, guv.
And we know that they were scared about retribution.
I've just checked with the nursing staff.
Stuart Teller arrived back at the hospital in the last hour.
Becky's his only child.
If he'd somehow found out what those boys had done...
Mr Teller?
Mr Teller.
DI Tanner.

Is this about my daughter's boss?
Just a quick word down the station, if you don't mind.
We're taking your dad in for questioning.
- Why?

I didn't know.
They say you can go home today.

Erm...

Why?
Becky, I need to ask you some questions that you might find difficult.
Embarrassing.
You know we were investigating the murder of your ex-boyfriend,
Frankie McAteer.
I'm afraid that his friend,
Liam Stanwell, was also murdered last night.
I'm sorry to have to tell you like this.
Did you know Liam well?
We went out... a couple of times.
Never really talked much.
Becky, I have to ask... .. did you ever have sexual relations with Liam Stanwell?
I know this is hard... .. but we need to talk about this.
That...
That doctor you brought to the house... .. I'll talk to her.
I found out that Bradwell had fired my daughter.
I went round there to reason with him.
You broke his nose.

Doesn't seem that reasonable to me.
Don't get me wrong, I can understand the anger.
Got a couple of girls myself.
Some of the fellas they've brought home?

Bushy beards, half-mast jeans.

Taking my fist and planting it full-square in their stupid, grinning faces.
But that's the difference between me and you, right there.
I fantasise about extreme violence... .. you actually do it.
If you can do that to some little ponce who sacked your daughter... .. I wonder what you'd do to someone who really hurt her.
Why don't you just say what you mean?
I think you know what I mean.

One of the boys involved put the footage on the internet.
You didn't know about this?
I said "boys", plural, and you didn't even question that?
The footage depicts your daughter having sex with the two young men who are now dead.
We don't know if it was consensual or if it was assault.
I can only imagine how terrible that must feel... .. knowing that your daughter's been treated that way.
If it was me... .. I'd want to do something about it.
And if I'd known about that... .. you bet your life, I would have done.
Becky, some footage was found on Frankie's phone.
He'd deleted it, but my colleagues managed to retrieve it.
You've seen it?
I think you should go.
I only agreed to see you because I thought you hadn't seen it.
- Just go.

But I think that maybe you agreed to see me because you know you need to talk about it.
And I'm a doctor, not a police officer.
It's a lot for you to carry around.
I don't actually remember that much.
I know...

I had sex with both of them.
- Oh, Christ.

To give consent, you need the freedom and the capacity to choose.
I don't think you got to choose, Becky.
Whatever happened wasn't your fault.
Look, I'm sorry.
This isn't me.
Before all this happened, I... .. I was strong,
I was...

I thought... that people that tried to kill themselves were... pathetic.
But I just... can't get it out of my head.
That's me, out there, on the internet, for anyone to see.
And I just want it to go away.
But I...
I just...
I know it never will.
What happened is awful.
But Liam and Frankie are dead.

Did you tell anyone?
Did you tell your dad?
Why did you lie to us, Mr Teller?
You said you didn't know about the footage.
We know that's not true.
Your daughter just informed a doctor.
When did she tell you?
A couple of days after.
She found out that one of those little bastards had uploaded it.
She was going out of her mind.
But you didn't approach the police.

Didn't want to draw attention to it.
And I thought I could handle it myself.
What do you mean by that?
I wanted to get that filth off the internet.
All I could think about was some old pervert sat at his computer watching my little girl.
- They put it up there.

- Oh, yeah.

- That was you?

I took a baseball bat to that little prick's head.
Took every ounce of my self-control to stop myself from killing him.
But you threatened him.

You said you had daughters.
Imagine your daughter was...
Raped.
She's my little girl.
I didn't kill those boys.
But when you find out who did, will you let me know, so I can shake them by the hand?
You've already confessed to two assaults, on Frankie McAteer and Jason Bradwell.
You need to start remembering where you were last night, cos if we can't establish your whereabouts, a GBH charge is gonna be the least of your worries.
No need to worry.
- We're just eliminating you from the scene.

Last one.
- That's it.

Is he here?
He is, yeah.
You're Frankie's father.
You have a right to see him.
I'm sorry for your loss, Mr McAteer.
It's not my loss.
Bill was his dad in every way that mattered.
You never told your brother?
I thought about it.
But Bill loved his boy, his boy loved Bill.
Anyone could see that.
I thought about it.
What a night!
Oh, man, I'm wasted!
Nikki?
You have to see this.
And this is my main man, Frankie.
- Clarissa, I really don't want to...

This is the raw footage from Liam's mobile that was recovered last night.

- And this... this is Becky.

Beautiful Becky.
Mate, your girlfriend is so fit.
I know, mate!
There.
Rewind.
Do you know him?
It's Becky's flatmate.
She said that she told him about the assault, but she never said he was actually there.
Maybe she didn't know.
I'm just saying the fact Paul Kirkeby was there
- may not mean that much.

And that makes him what?

If the killer's motive is to take revenge on anybody involved in what happened to Becky, he could be a potential victim.
The police still have Stuart Teller in custody, don't they?
So maybe it doesn't matter.

- That doesn't make sense.

The blood left by the gunman who shot Liam doesn't match the DNA on the cigarette dropped by the McAteer killer.
Yeah, but the same gun was used in both cases.
So, maybe it wasn't the gunman who dropped the cigarette in the garage forecourt.
Or, the blood you found at the flat isn't his.
Where are you going?
Back out the front door?
Yep.
Huh.
The fact that the DNA from both killings didn't match bothered me.
I mean, we know it was the same gun,
- so it had to be the same shooter, right?

I'm not saying that.
I'm saying that the person who ran out the back door just before you arrived wasn't the gunman.
I remembered this little quirk I read.
When you put Guinness under UV light, it luminesces.
Lights up bright green.
Now, the gunman stepped in Guinness.

He approached the point where Liam's body was found.
Presumably that's when he finished him off.
But does he go anywhere near the back door?

He exits the way he came in.

So who was the bloke I saw running from the flats?
I don't know, but it wasn't the gunman.
There were three people in that room -

What about Paul Kirkeby?
I cross-referenced all the data on Liam's phone to see if
I could find any correlation with Paul Kirkeby.
Just one hit.

From Liam to Paul on the day he died...
And we know from the footage found on Liam's phone that Paul was at his apartment on the night Becky was assaulted.
He knew what happened.
Are you following me?
Talked about the funerals today.
Father Gallagher suggested they're buried side by side, father and son.
I couldn't -- and I didn't want to...
No, no, no.

It's...

I saw him today.
I saw Frankie.
It wasn't my idea.
I...
I, um....
I'm glad.
Glad you saw him.
Yeah, so am I.
Carol...
You want to be a father to that boy?
You find out who did this.
You find 'em, and you tear them to pieces, d'you hear me?
You find 'em!
Sorry.
Woody?

Paul Kirkeby?
I'm DCI Underhill.

You all right, son?
Don't tell her, please.

We won't have to, unless it becomes relevant.
Why is it so important that Becky doesn't know you saw what happened, Paul?
Because I'm her friend.

She's ashamed.

You're worried that she might not want to look at you again.
But she told you afterwards.

Not all of it.

She doesn't remember much.

But you do.
They took advantage of her.
- But you didn't.

No, you weren't involved in any way.
Of course not!
I'd been out.
So when you came back, when you saw what was happening, why didn't you stop it?
Because you were afraid?
Did you know Liam and Frankie well?
- No.

- Yes.

I don't know.

Maybe?

The same day he was murdered.
He was murdered, and the last call he made was to you.
Yeah, that's... that's right.

- Now?

- What did he want to speak to you about?

Was he warning you, maybe?
- Why would he want to warn me?

Maybe you went to see him.
No.

Look, I answered the call, but as soon as I heard his voice, I cut it off.
- Why?

- Because you were angry about what he did to Becky.

You really care about her, don't you, Paul?
Yes.
Look, I-I don't know why Liam tried to call me.
Perhaps he was trying to get in touch with Becky, and that that when he couldn't contact her, he tried me.
OK, Paul, I can see that you're finding this stressful.
Just so we can cover all eventualities, appreciate it if you could tell us exactly where you've been the past couple of nights.
OK, so, Kirkeby's alibi checks out both nights.
He stayed over in Manchester on a training course.
Didn't finish until lunchtime, so he wasn't even in the city when the McAteers were killed.
And then last night he was in the pub.

He was drunk out of his skull.
Knocked over a table as he left around midnight.
So he can't've been the third person in the flat last night.
Yeah, but he's definitely hiding something.

Yeah, but we know how much he cares about Becky, and that does give him motive.
With that alibi, you're looking at accessory at best.
Could he have been working with Teller?

Have you established Teller's presence in the flat?
Turned the place upside down.

Yeah, but absence of evidence doesn't mean evidence of absence if he's prepared, forensically aware.
We are missing something here.
Cast iron alibi or not, Kirkeby has to be involved somehow, right?
Sorry to interrupt.

What did the police want?
They were asking about your dad.
Have you spoken to him?
What did they ask?
What he knew.
When he knew it.
What did you tell them?
The truth.
And that he didn't do it.
You don't know that.
Yes, I do.
This is your dad we're talking about, Becky.
He couldn't do something like that.
It's not a coincidence they're both dead.
I saw his face when I told him what happened.

It-it scared me.
If I hadn't told him, if I'd just kept it to myself...
You can't blame yourself.

Come on.

The doctors said you had to rest.
I'm sorry.

I just panicked, and I just wasn't...
- Don't ever say that.

Never be sorry.
I'm so lucky to have you.
Brilliant, thanks.
Have we got a name?
Clive Maitland.

Croxley Park Academy.

What, dressed like this?
Yeah, he was headed to the gym.
Colleagues say he went every day after work. 50 years old.
Trying to get back in shape.

I know the feeling.

Well, his wallet was emptied so they're running with robbery gone wrong.
Yeah, I don't buy it, either.
The victim has multiple stab wounds, separated into two distinct clusters.
Three wounds in the abdomen.
The majority of the blood...
Yeah, seems to have issued from the uppermost of these three.
- May have hit the celiac artery.

The wounds are elliptical in shape, suggesting the knife was doubled-edged.
Also, yeah, there are small contusions above and below each wound, which may indicate the weapon had some sort of fingerguard.
So what do you think?
Combat knife bought for the job, rather than a kitchen knife?
Possibly, yeah.
A blush of bruising.
Maybe.

Discoid bruising suggests the attacker grabbed the back of his neck with his right hand...
Whilst pushing the knife in with his left...
Thank you.
The wounds in the chest angle downwards.
Don't know.

Four, five, six -- seven stab wounds.
He really wanted to make sure.
I've got blood.

Given the location, it's unlikely to be spatter from the wounds.
This wound is ragged round the edges.

Either he had two weapons, or...
Or the weapon he was using was damaged in the act.
Yeah, there's a distinct mark, here on the sternum.
Can you get me some tweezers?
It looks as if the knife hit square on.
Sternum one, knife nil.
Anything interesting?
Yeah, blood on the victim's collar.
It's a possibility it came from the attacker.
Well, makes sense.
We found bruising suggesting the victim was grabbed by the neck.
This knife tip from the victim's chest -- unusual.
Think you can find a make?
We can try.
Are you OK?
Fine.

That noise.

Um, I've been putting some pictures up.
Are you sure you're OK, Paul?
Me?

I'm sorry about the noise.
'Night.
'Night.
Morning.
Can you come here a second?
You did go home last night?
I need you to check this, because I can't believe what I'm seeing...
DNA results from the blood on Maitland's collar, right?
OK.
OK, same DNA.

Tommy McAteer's back yard.
Whoever killed Clive Maitland was also present in McAteer's flat when Liam was killed.
Somehow, these cases are linked.
We're all absolutely devastated.
Mr Maitland was one of the transformational teachers.

I mean, you ask anyone in this community, and I guarantee they'll know someone whose life he helped turn around.
It's just so senseless.
How can the murder of a 51-year-old school teacher from the other side of town be linked to this case?
Unrelated victims.

The blade's coated in polytetrafluoroethylene.
- In English?

Does that suggest we could be looking at a kitchen knife after all?
I don't think so.
It's double-edged, for a start, and extrapolating from this fragment and your post-mortem,
I'd say that we're looking at a Teflon-coated stiletto knife.
You'd have to order that from abroad.
Which suggests the killing was pre-planned.
Hang on a second.
Liam and Frankie's murders were both gun crimes.
We're looking at two different killers.
One shot the McAteers and Stanwell, the other stabbed Maitland.
That's the man you saw running away.
And the blood we found in the backyard?
Same blood on Maitland's collar.
So what you're saying is, although we've got Stuart Teller in custody, he couldn't have killed Maitland, but he could have still carried out the other two murders.
Correct.

He was ex-military, wasn't he?

We're exploring that, but no joy so far.
Wait.

Rather than trying to find the link between the assailants, maybe we should be focusing on the link between the victims.
Thanks for agreeing to meet me here, Michael.

I, er, understand you told one of my colleagues you wanted to see your father's body.
I was hoping we could talk about him.
I don't know what I can tell you that I haven't already told your colleagues.
I'm on the investigation that might have some bearing on your father's murder.
I'm sorry?

Did your father ever mention someone called Frankie McAteer?
Liam Stanwell?
They ex-students?
No.

I already told the other police officers...
I know, and I'm sorry.
But if you could just tell me.
My dad had worked at Croxley Park all his career.
Never had any problems.

Couple of months ago, he had a run-in with two ex-students who were selling weed outside the school gates.
He confronted them.

It has to be him.
He was the last person to enter that alley before the girl who found the body.
Can you fast forward?
Yep.
Stop.

Now, you've been there -- where would he be going?
Jack?
It's not where he's going, it's what he's left behind.
He was carrying a plastic bag when he went down the alley.
He's dumped it.
You all right, mate?

Yeah, that's me.
Nice one.

Something about you needing a car.
Now, Woody tells me you nicked a car five nights back.
Black Nissan X-Trail.

Shit, mate -- look, if that was your motor...
Now...
I only want to hear two words from you now, son.
The name of the man you sold it to.
But you've searched here, right?
Obviously not well enough.
- Well, the bins?

Got something.
Urgh!
Watch yourself.
There you go.
He'd scouted the area.
Knew exactly where he was going to dump it.
New phone?
Er, yeah.
You going?
Er... bottle of wine.
Paul, is there something wrong?
Of course not.
If there was, you'd tell me, right?
Traced the knife to the manufacturer using the serial code on the blade.
It was shipped from Italy two weeks ago.
Address?
Well, the buyer stipulated a collection locker, so we can try to trace, but it might be difficult.
How did he pay?
- They won't say.

I'll be pensioned off before that happens.
Was Maitland's son able to give you any insight as to how the victims might be linked?
Nothing.

- Would a kid really go to the trouble of ordering a specialist knife like that?

Are you having a moment, Jack, or is there something you'd like to share with us?
I looked at trace residues on the knife blade.
It tests positive for toner ink.
Toner ink?
Toner ink.

Yeah, I know what it is, but how is it relevant?
How often do you actually have to change a toner cartridge?
This is either a massive coincidence, or we're looking at someone who does this all the time.
Who do we know who works in a print shop?

Yeah, and her flatmate Paul.
Hi, Becky.

No.

Paul ever talk to you about someone called...
Clive Maitland?
No.
D'you know where Paul was yesterday afternoon?
No,
I-I only saw him when he got back from talking to you.
Yeah, we noticed that he seemed distracted, anxious.
He's been acting strange since...

First I thought it was because of what I'd done.
Look, I know you're worried about him... and it's possible that he's got himself mixed up in something, and we need to get him out.
So Becky, if there's anything you can think of that might help us help him...
He smashed up his computer, and his phone.
We waited at the shop, he didn't show.
Becky tried calling, no answer.

She says he's been acting weird ever since yesterday.
When Maitland was murdered.
We know Kirkeby left the shop at three o'clock.
That gave him an hour to get across town to kill Maitland.
We picked him up on his return to the flat.
Chances are he'd just come straight from the crime scene.
Do we think he knew Maitland?
Well, Becky can't think why he would.
Totally different lines of work, different part of town.
The chances of them crossing in a city of eight million!

So what's the motive?

I don't know.

You reckon you might be able to get access?
How badly damaged?
Put it this way.

Can you do something or not?
Hate to say it, but, er,
Max specialises in data recovery.
Can we do it here?
Go on, then.
'Is that a yes?

Fine.

Good afternoon, Emma.
Afternoon.

Hi.
Hi there.

You're here!
- Welcome!

Jackson.
- Shall we?

I've seen worse.
I've just restored a laptop that'd been smashed up, then burnt by a blowtorch and then dumped in a river.
99% data recovery.
It's impressive.
People think computers are delicate as bone china... .. and everything disappears like it was never there.
If you're serious, you need to get an angle grinder...
Can you access it, Max?

This better be good, Tom, cos I'm up to my neck.
The car used by the gunman...

And that... that's your website.
And this?
That's the gunman.

Just check it out.

So I replaced the broken heads.
The platter was a bit scratched, but nothing too catastrophic.
Um...

100% data recovery.
I have to admit, I'm impressed.
That was Underhill.

Dreadnought.

Oh, I'm ahead of you.
Thinking they have some kind of relationship online?
Relationship?
Judging by the amount of correspondence I'm seeing here,
- they were halfway down the aisle.

In the last month they were talking on a forum non-stop, all day, every day...
Hello, Paul.
How d'you know my name?
It wasn't that difficult.
What am I supposed to call you?

Why are we here?
I wanted to know who you are.
You know who I am.
We're friends.
Friends don't pressurise each other to... to doing what we've done.
You threatened me!
You needed a push to go through with it.

To kill someone?
To do what you promised.
And I dunno why you're angry.
I should be the angry one.

How?
Don't know.
But I was careful.
Were YOU careful, Paul?
The night Becky was assaulted, Kirkeby was online.
He spent two hours on this website forum.

He can't talk about it.

Dreadnought.
Exactly.
All this in a month?
You can follow the narrative.

Paul's blowing off steam.
Fantasist projections, for Paul at least.
He's hurt, he's feeling impotent, he wants revenge for Becky.
He, er, he imagines torturing Liam and Frankie but it's scary movie stuff.
I'm not even sure Paul Kirkeby was aware that he was planning a murder.
But Dreadnought was.
At first he's the friendly ear, but that changes.
He has his own axe to grind.

Clive Maitland?
He doesn't mention Maitland by name.
So he builds the fantasy, feeds Kirkeby's anger.
Yeah, and then it's Dreadnought who suggests the murders.
So, how does Stuart Teller fit into this?
Well, he doesn't.
Paul and Stuart know each other in the real world.
This relationship's born online.
Well... how do we find Dreadnought?
I don't know, Thomas.
Nikki, you said something earlier.
Find the link between the victims.
But there IS no link between the victims.
And there's the point.

Paul Kirkeby worships Becky.
He knew what Frankie and Liam had done, and he was angry.
But he know he didn't kill them.

Of course he had an alibi for those murders, because he didn't do them.
Dreadnought did.
Paul and Dreadnought.

Each wants someone dead, neither wants to get caught.
So what do they do?

They swap murders.
You lied to me!

That he'd raped you, ruined your life.
He DID ruin my life!
No.

He was just an ordinary bloke.
The kids that he taught, they loved him.
They didn't know him.
No.

How can I be sure he wasn't just some random bloke you made me kill just because you bloody could?
Please!
Please tell me the truth, because I can't live with this.
I pushed a knife into a stranger's body and I took away... his life.
Are you following me?
'I can't eat.

'Every time I close my eyes, I see his face.
'He was trying to understand why...'
I know... you're looking for forgiveness.
You don't need it.
You killed for me,
I killed for you.
I'm not your enemy, Paul.

We found each other in the darkness.
We raised each other up.
You think that'll make everything better?
I never wanted this.

Well, you're going to have to learn to live with it.
Because if you can't, if you weaken... .. I'll find her again.
Do you understand?
'So we know Dreadnought's the prime mover?
'Absolutely.

So if Kirkeby's gone to ground, how do we find Dreadnought?
I don't know.

Did anyone follow you here?
No, I don't think so.

Changed tubes.

Thank you.

You won't thank me when you know what I've done.
I don't care.

Your phone, and computer...

Really, Becky, none of that matters any more.
I'm so scared.
Paul...
What's happening?
D'you remember when we first met?
Of course.
- When you started working at the shop...

No, it was at the Lamb and Flag about three weeks before.
You were drunk, and we talked.
I fell in love with you that night.

You were the most magical person that I'd ever met.
You told me where you worked.
I used to walk past the shop now and again, trying to bump into you... and then a job came up, and I applied.
When I first saw you at the shop,
I was ready to make out it was all this big coincidence, but you didn't remember me.
Now, when I say it, it all sounds kinda creepy, I know.
They raped you, Becky.

Don't say that.
I don't know if that's what they thought they were doing, but it really doesn't matter.
I was there, and I was too scared to do anything.
Argh!
Why?

I know this changes everything.
I know you won't ever want to see me again, but... you needed to know what they did to you, Becky.
I think it's how you get better.
Go.

Please!
Don't-Don't come back to the flat tonight, go to your dad's.
Please.

'Society has to extract its petty revenge however inhumane as it may be.
'Don't get bitter, son, just do your time and move on.
'Well, I mean, will you?
'It's not any of my business why you're in here, but...
'Oh, it was a heist...'
Nikki...
Clive Maitland's DNA.
He's a paternal match.
Paternal match for who?
The man who gunned down the McAteers.
The gunman's Clive Maitland's son.
You came quickly.
I can't live with this.
I know.
I've been trying to work out how the police linked the murders.
I went to the flat.
Where Liam was staying.

Why would you do that?

I can't live with this, any of it!
You don't need to be scared, Paul.
I'm not.
I told you -- now you tell ME.
Who was he?
My father.
Your father?
Are you following me?
- Why?

What?
Shut up.
SHUT UP!
Single shot pierced the frontal bone.

Death would have been almost instantaneous.
- Weapon?

Please tell me you can put Michael Maitland in the flat?
Not yet.
But you have DNA evidence -- the cigarette butt dropped out of the SUV window.
His brief's already suggested that Maitland visited that garage earlier that same week.
Scouting it out in advance.
Or filling up with petrol if you believe him.
So unless we can prove that the cigarette we found was indisputably dropped from that SUV on the night in question, then...
Thank you.
For, um...

It's a very human need.
Seeing the things that upset us makes them real... .. and then we can move on.
He said that...
.. I was raped.
Maitland has been released pending further investigation.
How is that even possible?
The CPS don't think there's enough evidence to launch a prosecution yet.
But he's had to surrender his passport.

- You thinking he might wriggle out of this?

We've got some forensic evidence and we're hoping we can pin him on it, but the bulk of the case rests on his online interactions with Kirkeby.
HTCU are working on it, and it's a massive job.
Big difference between what we know and what we can prove.
Have faith, Mrs McAteer.

Ah, Max.
Excuse me a second.
Thanks a lot for all your assistance.
Oh -- always happy to collaborate.
And, um, if you ever want to kick some of your employees my way for a little training...
- What's wrong, Jack?

I'm... a bit worried he's going to try and tempt you away.
- Well, he does try.

Well, he tries because Max is Max and he can't help himself.
He knows I'll never say yes.
Big pay rise, swanky office.
And leave all this?
You never know.
No.

Besides -- you'd be lost without me.
Proper catch-up soon?
Absolutely.
- Right.

- Text me when you leave?

I know I married him for his mind, but...
I do love the way that man leaves a room...
What will you do with the business?
Well, I'll try and run it.
There's been a McAteer at Billingsgate for 150 years,
I can...

Let's talk about money later, though.
Yeah, yeah.
Or you could help me.
You and me.
Together.
Too late for us, Tommy.
I want to be a pathologist, Nikki, but I have to go home.
It's not your job.

Maybe our being here is another reason for them to kill.
Tell me, where are they?
Nikki!
