Where's the doctor?
I know what to do.
You pulled me from the fire, but you're not burned?
I was lucky... my hat wasn't.
Are you really who he says you are?
Anderson?
I've been called a lot of things by his kind.
The Beast, Black Cat,
He-goat.
In that book of his, they call me a dragon.
Which of those are you?
In this town?
No one looks at me and sees a dragon.
Maybe they're not looking hard enough.
These injuries are gonna heal.
And that pain you felt before, inside you, all that's gonna leave, too.
And you're gonna become a part of something bigger than this town.
I can help.
I'm feeling better.

No!

This should do nicely.
There wasn't a single car on the ride out.
End of the road.

Those windows need to be covered up.
All this needs to be cleared out, make room for the cots.
You can put the blankets...

You must be Sidney.
I thought you were gonna bring the cots in?
Well, I wanted to make sure this is where you wanted them before I started hauling them all in.
Sidney, Evelyn has told me about you.
It's an honor.
I didn't know this place was still here.
It's all right.

As much as he needs to know.
And he's eager to join us when it's time.
Well, good news.

We need all the help we can get.
I have a job for you already, Peter.
That skylight needs to be blacked out, right up there.
I sent Kat Ogden up north.

Too many people knew what she was doing for you.
And Kat Ogden was too devoted to her husband.
That wasn't a problem for me.
So strange, that lurking sense of attachment to a single person.
That isn't...

It certainly won't be now.
Maybe we should go inside and get dried off?
I'm not going back in that Goddamn cabin.
Your call.
Little late for a swim... alone... with your clothes on.
It's exactly what it looks like, okay?
But it was a mistake.
I was trying to save myself when you came charging to the rescue.
Ow.
Thanks, by the way.
You're welcome.
That's it?

Excuse me.
I thought my life-saving heroics spoke for themselves.
I was just expecting more...

It's not my job to judge, Megan.
We all got our shit.
Like the good book says...
"Our troubles come in more than one kind,"
"some from ahead and some from behind."
That's not from the Bible.
That's Dr. Seuss.
It's still a damn fine book.
I don't imagine you smoke?
Are you sure you're okay?
No, I'm not sure about that at all.
Just yesterday, I might have waded out there with you.
Couple of rocks in my pockets for good measure.
Mom?
Where did you go?
There she is.
Amber?

Hey, baby!

She was worried about you.
Are you okay?

It is just way past my bedtime.
That's what I told her.
What are you doing?
I missed you so much.
I missed you too.
Hey, let me show you something.
There is a fish in the aquarium by the nurses's station the exact same color as your bike.
Why don't you find it?
So you know where it is?

Okay.
Using her to get to me?

You really think I would do that to our daughter?
Whether or not you meant to, it's not...
She ran away, Allison.

I found her wandering down the road.
She'd rather be here.

She knows what happened.
She knows you didn't do anything.
Jesus, Kyle, how is that supposed to help?
Don't worry, honey, everything's fine,
Mommy's not possessed anymore.
Then you explain it to me.

It was a traumatic break.

That's what these doctors tell you.
I'm protecting her.
I'm going to get my dad.
Kirby.
Kirby, what are you up to?
But she's alone.
Sorry, he wanders off sometimes.
It's best not to be frightened.
Baby, I don't believe that something could just break inside of you, cause you to hurt our child.
I don't think you believe that either.
Why don't I take you to see your parents.
Amber?

Amber.
What's wrong?
I don't like this place.
Let's go, Firefly.
No!
No!
Another cheeseburger?
Why are you babysitting me?
Is that all you think I'm good for?

Oh, of course not.
I just needed to come up for some air.
The world could have ended and I wouldn't even know.
Well, we're trying to keep that from happening.
And?
Kyle and I don't see eye-to-eye on how... aggressive to handle the situation.
Well... he's a good boy.
No matter what the town thinks of him.
But he's still a boy.
He doesn't have your instincts, honey.
And he damn sure ain't the chief of police.
Rev?

What are you doing out here?

Who drove off, Megan?
I got to the cabin after dark,
I heard some splashing in the lake and she was out there.

It's okay.

She tried...?
Megan tried to kill herself?
She had second thoughts.

Everything seemed okay.

She say where she was going?
No, she just drove off.
Wipe your feet.
How does fried chicken sound for dinner?
Biscuits and gravy too?
Like we always do...
Holly...
I don't want to be here.
We belong here.
This is where our family lives.
We're not a family anymore.
Of course we are.
It's not gonna be the same.

But we're gonna be okay.
It was a terrible accident.
It wasn't an accident.
You should be in bed.
I'm hungry.
He doesn't look very appetizing.
L-O-L.
Thought we were gonna fuck this town up.

So when are we gonna start having fun?
When you get stronger.
I'm fine.
I'm not the one hacking up all that black shit.
You want to have fun?
Cut him up.
What?
I need to dispose of this body.
Take that knife, cut him up.
Are you serious?
Are you?
You want to be like me?

You want to fuck this world and all the pathetic creatures in it?
Yeah.
Then show me that you're strong enough, that you're obedient enough.
Do it.
Get back to bed.
Chief Giles?
Chief?
Hi.

We're on it.

But John...

You arrested him and then you let him go?
We had no reason to hold him.
I don't understand.

Where that man Sidney was staying.
My son might have been in that building.
We looked all over that scene.

So you're just dropping it?

Now, that boy of yours been trying to get out of your house since his old man died.
It looks like he finally made it.
I'm sorry.
You know, when you became chief, his old man didn't like it.
He told me that you raised through the ranks too fast considering.
And I argued with him.

Patricia...

Your friend confessed and you let him go.
I think the mayor's gonna have an opinion about how you're enforcing the law around here.
Patricia...
Holly, are you hungry?
How 'bout some mac and cheese?
Hon?
Holly?
Someone's here.
Megan, what the hell?
Come on in.
You can go wait on the swing for me.

If I'd been serious, I would have used a gun.
Jesus, Megan.
It was a classic cry for help, okay?
It's embarrassing.

You got to talk to somebody.
I've got a psych degree, I know the drill.
How did you know I'd be here?
'Cause I know you.

But you can't just pretend everything's fine.
It was a weak moment, it won't happen again.
It won't.
What could make me do that, Kyle?

I loved him so much.
I know.
What do you think?
I could give you a lot of psychobabble, but, honestly, I never... ever thought I'd hear myself say these words... but maybe Anderson isn't crazy.
Maybe there is evil out there, and it gets inside us somehow.
I just...

But I can promise you one thing.
It's never ever coming near me again.
I'm pregnant.
Wow.
Mm-hmm.

I have to be okay.
Is Aunt Megan okay?
I hope so.
She's sorry she ditched you.
I'm glad all's well.
You didn't have to stay.
I don't think there's much more either of us can do.
Kyle, the reason I came looking for you in the first place, there's a young man I was locked up with.
They took him to the hospital.
He needs your attention.
What's the point, Rev?
Doing this thing one at a time isn't working.
We're not getting anywhere.
I'm thinking that boy can give us some answers.
Maybe help us root out Sidney.
Why not turn over every stone?
Is the person sick like Mommy?
I can help.
You can't just leave them that way.
I know.

You're going to go visit Grandma Lauren.
But I want to be with you.
I know you do.

You know, one minute, he's just a kid pissed off with the world, the next, he's pushing his body through the bars, threatening that there's no Outcast there to help me.
We'll see what he has to say now.
I heard you weren't tossed in here like the rest of us were.
You checked in.
You make it sound like a resort.
You checked out the spa?
They do a killer sea salt body scrub.
A friend of mine worked at a resort in Singapore.
Kept trying to get me to fly down.
Got caught selling pot to the guests.
They caned him.
You know, with an actual cane.
Whack!

Whack!

A hundred times.
Things are a little different here, I hope.
Completely.

My friend was beaten so bad, they had to put him in the hospital before they could send him to prison.
They had to make him better, so they could make him worse.
Just like you.
You don't know anything about me.
In Amber's bedroom, your eyes were open.
Pink lampshade, princesses and ponies.
You were awake before he put you to sleep again.
Bap!
Your husband, while your hands were around your little girl's throat.
Bap!
Bap-bap!
You should have seen him.
The shape that boy was in, he couldn't have left here on his own.
He didn't.

Who else could sneak him out of here?
He's got to be working with Sidney.
Where would they take him?
Somewhere where he can finish... changing.
Like where they took Megan.
How do we find it?
Sidney can't be doing this all on his own.
Last time he had the Ogdens.
He's using people who have already turned.
That could be anyone.
What are you gonna do, run around touching everyone in town?
We know one.
Maybe if you'd been a little smarter, you could've got the job done right the first time, huh?
How's your threats now?

And your deeds?
Or your songs?
Yeah.

Ain't nobody scared of you no more.
I'm sorry, what was that?
So you're sad 'cause you're going back in the ground?
Well, fuckin' A, you should be.
It's lonely down there.
You ain't gonna be alone long though.
Shut the hell up.

Spring cleaning?
Daddy gave me this book for my birthday.
I know that, honey.
And he said this headband matched my eyes.
Holly, what are you doing?
You want to put Daddy away, and I want him here with us.
I miss him too.
But we'll be okay in this house.
No, we won't.
Not ever.
Okay...

Do you...

Yeah, I'm just doing a little outreach.
Word of mouth's pretty much the only way people find us out where we are.
Is this a church?
Oh, no, the lighthouse is a symbol.
Technically, we worship in a barn.
You don't worry about that pissing off God?
As God sees it, the flock makes the church, not the building.
"As God sees it."
You have no idea how far up the wrong tree you're barking.
I know the lighthouse metaphor is a little on the nose, but... look for the beacon.
Anybody home?
Joshua?
Who's in there?
Get your fucking hands off me!
Mindy...

Mindy, stop, it's me, Reverend Anderson.

I thought...

Come on, catch your breath.

It's okay.

There was shouting.

I hid.

Who?

Who?
He's an older man, he wears a dark suit, he has white hair.
Was he the one who took 'em?

It was that creepy guy from the junkyard.
All right.
It's okay, it's okay.
Holly?

It was here.
I saw it.

It was here.

That was from Daddy too.
The blood.
Oh, baby.
It's gone.
It's okay...

You did this!
You let Daddy die!

Holly...

It's your fault!

Holly...

Listen to me.

It's okay.
Come here.

You're right.

I'm not here to hurt you.
We all know what's been going on out there.
You can't send 'em back, we're gonna have to start rounding 'em up.
Like cattle?

That man on the cot there.

- What about Joshua, Chief?

Is this gonna end like this?

Out of all people, I thought he'd understand.
They're all dangerous.
How about letting me lock his ass up.
And the Reverend too until he comes to his senses.
Who the hell are you?
This is Bob.

How do you think Mark's car got in that ditch?
We can stop 'em, Chief, but not like this.
The Outcast is wrong.
All your efforts are for nothing.
Less than nothing.
Whatever you say.
Jason!

We'll walk out of this together.
What the hell?
- Get his arm!

There's too much!
Shit!
It's trying to get back in.
Giles!
Back up!
It's gonna be all right now.
Tell Sidney what you saw here tonight.
Let him know it's not just me he's fighting against.
Who is it?
Something I promised I'd keep buried.
Promised who?

You think you're the first one to take up this fight.
I got a history lesson for you.
This one had a real pretty face.
But she did a shit-ton of damage before we put her down.
A shit-ton.

Who is she?
She's the thing you've been fighting against.
The same way we were.
Except you call yours...

We?

Me and the one that stopped it 30 years ago.
Your old man.
The doctor says your light is shining brighter again.
I'm glad.
Do you know how rare you are?
How lucky we were to find you?
I...
I'd never hurt you.
But I'm not doing nearly so well.
I need you to help me, again.
