I always remember the day my little sister first arrived.
She was as fragile as spring snow, and hiding behind Mom, she cast her eyes down as she glanced at me.
From today, she's going to be your little sister.
Please take good care of her.
I smile, and reply, "Sure!"
Hey there!
Nice to meet you, Big Brother.
N-Nice to meet you.
Ever since, I haven't seen my little sister at all.
I'll be right there!
Sagiri, I brought your meal.
I'll be going now!
All right!
I go to school, but I also work as a light novel author.
From a year ago, I've been continually fighting.
Wanna try this place?
Against my little sister who refuses to leave her room.
My irritation that I'm still only a high school student.
Now, the only family member left for me is my little step-sister.
From that incident a year ago, my little sister shut herself in her room
and stopped communicating with everyone.
"Come out of your room so I can see your face." That is my only wish.
Adachi Fourth Public High School
The super-dangerous action that I sealed away from the trauma I suffered after debuting...
Masamune Izumi Autograph Event
I debuted as a light novel author right around when I entered middle school.
And for the three years since, my trusty partner who draws really erotic art,
Silverwolf of Reincarnation 3 And for the three years since, my trusty partner who draws really erotic art,
I really recommend this book!
I have yet to meet this partner of mine.
And the other day,
I had my first autograph session commemorating the series completion.
I showed my face during the autograph session.
So there's a chance my classmates might have realized.
Looks like I'm okay for noâ€”
[TERRIBLE NEWS] Masamune Izumi-sensei's autograph is too messy lolololol
Come on now, stuff like that happens all the time.
If you ask me, it's the price of fame.
I'm really not that famous, though.
Dissing someone like you, Mune-kun, isn't going to increase page views on a blog, either.
Tomoe, what you're saying is even worse.
Mune-kun, Mune-kun.
I was just looking at that post.
Isn't this the blog of the "sensei" who draws illustrations for your novels?
Eromanga-sensei's Doodling Blog "At the Tip of the Panties"
Eromanga-sensei's Doodling Blog "At the Tip of the Panties"
Eromanga-sensei sure disses you in a strangely happy fashion, don't you think?
Mune-kun, did you do something to this person?
I mean, I haven't even met the guy yet.
Despite working together for three years?
My editor said she's never met this guy, either.
Apparently all the work is done over the internet.
A work style of the modern era!
Maybe the guy found out I complained about the lewd pen name?
Why don't you take a look?
I'm home!
A live streaming, huh?
Yeah, yeah, got it!
Wait just a second!
Sagiri.
When you're done eating, leave the dishes outside the room!
All right, let's see what kind of person this is.
NiyaNiya Live
So, today's art won't be that erotic.
Izumi-sensei is a really terrible person.
He mercilessly killed off such a cute girl like her.
Masamune Izumi / My regards!
Shut up!
And there we go, done!
Now, which character should I draw in the next stream?
- Beniusagi, naked version - something erotic!
So this is Eromanga-sensei.
I'd like it to be from something I've worked on...
What does this mean?
That's what I made earlier.
What's being shown here is... my home?
Could this be my little sister?
"Are you Sagiri?"
Wait, I can't disclose her real name!
No!
Well then, I'm planning to stream again tomorrow.
This could be bad.
It's not coming off.
Oh no, no, no, no, no!
This is all too bad!
If Eromanga-sensei is Sagiri, my little sister's strip show will be broadcast to the entire world!
It's off.
Nice to meet you, Big Brother.
It's been a while, Big Brother.
It was my first reunion with my little sister in a year.
It's been a while.
Has it been like a year?
You're Eromanga-sensei?
That stream earlier...
That wasn't you?
I don't know anyone by that name.
I can't hear you.
I...
I don't know anyone by that name.
Then why did you pick a pen name like that?
Whoa!
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!
Let go!
Aren't you Eromanga-sensei, who drew illustrations for "Silverwolf of Reincarnation"?
I-I'm not...
That's amazing!
So many of your fans were watching, too, and you made them all happy.
You've been doing some amazing things.
Your...
Your illustrations are really erotic.
A-And Sagiri, actually, I-I...
No!
Go away!
I'm sorry, Izumi-sensei.
I've been really busy lately!
I'm in charge of so many hit titles that I've only slept for two hours the past two nights!
What's this?
Proposals?
This one is a superpower school battle series like the previous one.
And this is an adventure in an alternate universe.
Wait, these are complete manuscripts!
I thought that would be faster.
I told you the other day to submit something that conveys the plot in 10 seconds!
Did you?
And this is the script for when it turns into an anime.
Izumi-sensei, you sure changed from about a year ago.
Oh, I used to do this as an extension of my hobby.
I wrote stories that I thought were fun to read, and it felt good to have everyone else read and enjoy them.
But now...
I need money.
It's a commonplace reason.
Isn't that okay, though?
That's an ordinary reason for someone who writes for a living.
If it leads to your motivation, I don't care what it is.
Oh, there's one more thing that will motivate you, Sensei.
The "Silverwolf" series that ended the other day is the title that I'm known for right now.
But!
Sagiri!
The guys I thought I'd never meet again were all waving at me.
That made me happy, so...
Listen to me!
I am Masamune Izumi, the author of "Silverwolf of Reincarnation"!
Really?
Big Brother, you're Masamune Izumi?
The author of "Silverwolf of Reincarnation"?
Y-Yeah, that's right.
And you're Eromanga-sensei, right?
I don't know anyone by that name.
I-Is that bad?
Of course it's not bad.
I finally met you!
Come in.
It's okay?
I-I said it's okay.
Good girl.
...Don't.
"Don't treat me like a child?"
Don't touch me.
Sit there.
"Touch me there"?
Sure!
Ouch!
Wh-Wh-What?
I only got closer because you were speaking softly!
Ahh...
Is this okay?
How did you figure it out?
You mean, "How did you realize that I was the person behind Eromanga-sensei"?
Yup.
If not, I won't ever let you in.
When you were streaming, the meal I made for you was in the background.
You forgot to turn the camera off, and you started taking your clothes off...
So after all, Big Brother, you were "Masamune Izumi-sensei".
I was just thinking you had the same name.
To think that I've been living under the same roof as Eromanga-sensei.
I can't believe it.
And I don't know anyone by that name.
Um, this is so sudden, and I don't know what to do.
For starters, I'm sorry I made you draw all those lewd pictures!
I-Idiot!
Don't suddenly shout so loudly, idiot!
Your illustrations are really erotic.
You can't just say that to a girl, s-so suddenly!
Do you have to get that angry?
I was talking about how I was requesting lewd illustrations from my little sister!
L-Lewd illustrations are my job, and I like it, so it's okay!
But you can't talk about stuff like that!
Why?
Th-That's...
It's fine if you understand.
I-In the first place, Big Brother, you're all sorts of no good.
All sorts?
F-For instance...
Writing is my side job, so of course I'd be home working!
Even during summer vacation?
Right.
Back then, everything I wrote was getting turned down, so I pulled a lot of all-nighters.
So I forgot to make you meals.
The despair I felt when meals didn't arrive even after thumping the floor do you know how that feels, Big Brother?
Come out of your room and eat.
I think I've lost if I leave my room!
Even if you say it like a famous quote, it's not cool.
By the way, I noticed you blog and stream stuff.
I-Is that bad?
You weren't the person I knew, and you were really lively.
What's wrong?
I want to hear more stuff like that.
I hardly know anything about you.
The reason why I started drawing illustrations was because Mom taught me.
I was naturally doing nothing but drawing since I was little...
And I was a professional before I knew it.
Mom complimented me, saying it was amazing.
After Mom was gone,
I couldn't draw at all.
And I couldn't leave my room.
But one day, I saw someone streaming.
That person was happily drawing while chatting with everyone.
I was jealous.
I wanted to be like that, and tried it out.
I see.
It was really fun.
After seeing the illustrations, they give me their opinions, like "so cute", "so amazing".
They ask me to draw more.
I'm still in my room, but I can play and chat with people all over the world like we're friends.
That, really, really makes my heart race.
The reason I became an author was because the people posting their novels on the internet seemed to have fun.
There was a time when I wrote novels on the web, too.
That's why I'm here right now.
The Adventures of Hero Masamune Congrats on the Completion!
I see, so Izumi-sensei, you too...
"Sensei"?
Big Brother, why are you bothering me?
You should just leave me alone.
I'm just...
Do I trouble you?
T-Trouble...
It's because you're my little sister.
And Mom asked me to take good care of you.
Is that your reason?
I still don't know what counts as taking good care of you.
So I just do things that I feel would count as such.
I don't get it at all.
Other than that, I'm just lonely, after all.
I'd like to eat meals together with my cute little sister.
And I want to take care of her, too.
Even a troublesome little sister like this, who hardly ever talks to you?
So you were aware of that.
I want us to get along.
Because we're family.
Are we a family?
You don't call people merely living together a family.
Sure thing.
Sagiri.
What?
This illustration made me really happy.
Let's do our best together next time, too!
Yes?
I'm Megumi Jinno!
Is Sagiri-chan here?
