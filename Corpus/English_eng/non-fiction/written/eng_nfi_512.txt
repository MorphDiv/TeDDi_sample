You sure you're ready for this?
I was born ready.

We're also ready, for the record.
Welcome, ladies and lords, to Castle Degrassi!
This year's prom theme will be One Enchanted Evening.
It will be a night of magic!
This prom theme promises the perfect fairy-tale ending to our time at Degrassi.
Love it!

- [chuckles]

Stop it, Chewy.
I would've never thought of the smoke bomb.
Shall we rendezvous later for some budgeting?
You mean where I do the budgeting and you watch?
- Can't wait.

So, how long have you had a thing for Winston?
[chuckles] What?

Come on, you were totally flirting with him.
[sighs] We're not flirting.

Does he know that?
Sparkling soda water toast.
To Goldston!

One class a day and then chauffeured back to the rehab center.
- Are you jealous?

Only of your hands-on physiotherapist.
- [scoffs] Yeah, you should be.

[Mr. Mitchell] Miles!
Sorry to interrupt.
- Do you got a second?

A friend of mine works at the London Academy of the Arts.
They have one of the most exciting creative writing programs in Europe.
- Sounds amazing.

Well, she's in town, and asked about any outstanding students that might be a fit for their last spot this fall.
You... you mean me, right?

- Yes, he means you, modesty boy.

Have you considered any writing programs like this for next year?
No, not really.
Um, I did just find out I got into Queen's for business.
I know it's last minute, but can I set up an interview for you?
Do you think I'm good enough for a program like this?
If you'd heard my recommendation, you wouldn't be asking me that.
Yes, please, set it up.
I'll prep tonight.

[chuckles] Thank you.
I will let her know.
The world needs to hear your voice, Miles!
[chuckles]
[Hunter] Everyone say, "All-inclusive!"
- [all] All-inclusive!

All right, I've got a chem test I got to cram for, so see you later.
You're gonna frag that test.
All right, let's post it.
Why rush?

I'm sure it'll be fine.
Guys, look at this.
[Baaz] Yael's got armpit hair?
[Baaz and Vijay] Ew!
I had no idea Hunter had a taste for Wookiee.
- Shut up, I didn't know.

I am.

Listen, if you heroes want to ask Yael to shave her pits, be my guest.
Or we can digitally groom the hair out before it's due tonight.
I don't know.

I know what everybody else is gonna say.
This isn't just our reputation.

[Rasha] Write out the formation reaction for phosphoric acid.
Hey?

Oh, sorry.
It's just that Zoë said something weird to me.
She said Winston and I are flirting.
- Oh, she sees it, too?

When have you ever seen me flirting, ever?
Uh, last night, when you two were posting about "What's the best cookie?"
He insisted oatmeal raisin.

The correct answer is gingerbread.

[clears throat]
"You are objectively wrong.

How is that flirting?
Because it goes on until 2:00 a.m.
"Take that back or you're never sharing my poutine again!"
It is late-night flirting!
We were talking.

Have you ever seen the way you smile when you're around him?
I smile around you, too.

Mmm, it's different.
No, it's not, because you and me are just friends and Winston and I are just friends.
- Does he know that?

[cell phone vibrating]
- Oh, there's my friend right now.

Oh.
[gasps]
Was that a picture of his little Winston?
[stammers] That is definitely the wrong idea.
[Miles] Yeah, this program is insane.
Two grads from there won a BAFTA last year. [Chuckles]
[Tristan over phone] So, you're saying this could lead to me meeting Idris Elba?
[Mr. Hollingsworth] Are we celebrating the good news?
- Ah, I...

Your mother told me about Queen's Commerce.

Listen, I know we're still rebuilding, but, um...
I wanted to give you this.
Go ahead.
I had some amazing years in that program, and you're gonna do great.
Wow, thank you.
Um, speaking of programs,
I also have an interview for the London Academy of the Arts,
- for a creative writing program.

Well, I...

Yes, of course.

What else do you have to say?
I've written short stories, too.
Listen, I'm not raining on your parade.
I, uh, just question if writing is enough to pay for convertibles
- and iPhones and...

Exactly.

[sighs]
Do you really think you're good enough?
Well, I was good enough to get this opportunity.
Hey, uh, would you guys remove armpit hair from a photo of you?
- [Frankie and Esme] Yes.

But if I was a chick, yeah.
It's no big deal.
I'm just trying to fix Yael's armpit hair.
More like making a mess.

- [Hunter sighs] - [Frankie] Let's go check it out.
[Esme] Okay, so after I'm done trimming the hedges, what else should I photoshop?
I don't know.

Oh, sweet, sweet, simple boy.
You could remove her blemishes, fix her eyebrows, some contouring...
Okay, slow down.

Yeah, nobody's put a real photo of themselves online since, like, 2005.
Everyone wants to put the best version of themselves online.
Trust us.

And you'll thank me after she's done thanking you.
All right, let's do this.
This school is crazy competitive.
- Are you sure I'm good enough?

Tell me some of the ideas that you're bringing. [Grunts]
Okay, well, the one that I think sucks the least, it... it'd be a story about World War II, but if they had social media then.
So, you'd hear everyone's fears, and their secrets and their unique stories.
[sighs] Definitely tell that one.
And relax, they're already looking for people like you.
- People like me?

Didn't you see it on the website?
This spot is reserved for diverse applicants.
- Diverse as in a rich white guy?

Aren't you dating Tristan?
Yes, but I...

It doesn't matter how you identify.
Your work speaks loud and clear to your unique point of view.
So, I got this shot because I have a boyfriend,
- not because I'm good.

You didn't have to.
Well, my dad'll love this.
- Anyway, I have class.

Better settle in.

Is... is something wrong?
You were having fun yesterday.
I'm fine.

Okay, well, [taps bench]
Don't you want to sit where you can see the spreadsheet?
- I'm comfortable on this side.

Well, I'll come to you.

Make your column bigger?
Yeah, I can never remember where the menu is.
I can't do this.
What?

Because you ruined everything.
What?
I can start a new spreadsheet!
Hot off the press.

You, Sir, are an artiste.
What do you think?
Why did you change everything on me?
- But you look great in the picture.

So what, I don't look great any other time?
[chuckles] No one uses real photos anymore.
Besides, if I hadn't changed it, you'd, uh... see your armpit hair.
- So?

I'm not embarrassed by it, if that's what you're asking.
If you want a real shock, I also haven't been shaving my legs.
Wow.
What's the big deal?
It's not like you guys shave your pits or your legs.
Yeah, but we're, um...
What, boys?

I just thought that girls shaved under their arms.
Why is it such a big deal?
I think that what you're doing is brave.
Never mind.
[Zoë] See?

- That, that, that.

Um, I regret to inform you that I am resigning from the prom committee, effective immediately.
Okay...

- How could you just bail on Winston?

- A picture of what?

[laughs] Who doesn't like pickles?
Yeah, like, from his sandwich?
Like from his pants.
No!
He didn't.

You were right, okay?

Whoa, no one deserves a junk pic.
Yet it seems to be the cost of being a girl these days.

Still, I thought Winston was a nice guy.
Me, too.
- That doesn't make it not harassment.

I've been so shocked, I didn't stop to think.
I didn't consent to that photo.
This isn't my fault.

Blake... [stutters] Mr. Mitchell.

He's such a fan of your work, and I must say, I was also very impressed with your script.
Sure.
For something that you and your boyfriend were in the middle of, you bring a very sensitive outsider's insight.
Well, actually, the further I get away from that script, um, the less it really does for me.
- Really?

Um, it has the whole queer issue gimmick, but I can do better.
- Sorry, gimmick?

I see myself as the type of writer who can tell any story.
Of course.
And... and what do you think your unique point of view
- can bring to those stories?

Sure, your bisexuality...
I'm not just about sex with boys, if that's what you're saying.
Look, I just... [sighs] want to be a writer.
Okay, well, let's hear some ideas.
[Zig] I forgot my wallet.
How many times do I have to explain to you?
Hey, tell your girlfriend, thanks for the garbage advice.
Yael was so mad I photoshopped out her armpit hair.
[both laughing] [stutters] Your girl has armpit hair?
- [laughs] - [laughs] I mean...
I can see you guys are full of help.

Hey.

Why don't you just tell her you're not into it?
Because that will only make her more mad?
[Tiny] It shouldn't.
People can't help what they find attractive.
Yep, it's true.

Tiny here likes girls who are a little muscle-y.
Mmm, and Zig likes it when their teeth are a little too big.
Hey, I like what I like.
Just like Tiny likes his chemistry teacher.
- You said you'd take that to the grave.

So, I'm allowed to just ask her to change for me?
- Yeah, of course.

The coolest.
Zig's right.

Hey, I was gonna finish the budgeting, but if you changed your mind...
How could you do something so disgusting?
Um...
Fine, pretend like you don't know what you did, but I'm not quitting prom.

Can we talk some place less exposed?
It is so not okay to send unsolicited pictures of... it to girls!
Pictures of what?
I have zero idea what you're mad about.
Okay, just because I accidentally flirted with you, does not give you the right to send me an... [inhales sharply]
A no-pants pic!
Oh, God.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Oh, my... oh, my God!
Oh, dear God.
[grunts] That wasn't meant for you.
I thought I sent it to Miles.
Wait, what?
It's a dumb joke we have going on, and you and I have been messaging so much, [stutters] I must've sent it to you as a reflex.
I don't get it.
Well, it's... it's like, here's a picture of a stapler.
Here's a picture of a chair.
Boom, here's a picture...
It's, not, like, out.
It's... it's hidden in, like, a fruit bowl or a... a pack of hot dogs.
[sighs] It's a really dumb guy joke and you shouldn't have been caught in the crossfire.
I am so, so, so sorry.
[sighs]
Wait... did you...
Did you say you were flirting with me?
Um, I have to go.
How'd the interview go, hotshot?
Oh, I think I made a case for who I am and not just some quota.
Quota?

Uh, Mr. Mitchell tried to get me to apply for some diversity spot,
- but I told them that's not for me.

Miles Hollingsworth III applied for a diversity spot?
- [scoffs] - [chuckles] [school bell ringing]
Just got a call.
Sounds like that wasn't even you at the interview.
[Miles sighs]
Well, I guess I just wasn't diverse enough.
I suggested you for that spot because you have talent, not because of your diversity.
Except I'm a white guy with a trust fund.

Sure, you have privilege, but there are other factors that give you a unique perspective.
Everyone... push your desks back and line up.
We're gonna try an exercise.
Come on, line up.
Line up shoulder to shoulder.

Okay.
First question.
If you are able to show affection to your romantic partner in public without fear of bullying... take a step forward.
If your school holidays coincide with the religious holidays you observe at home... take a step forward.
Next question.
[sighs]
- I want you to shave your armpits.

Wow.
- Look...

I'm sorry I changed the picture without asking.
I talked to the yearbook guy and resubmitted the untouched photo.
I...

- And you don't like armpit hair?

Well, what if I do?
Do you?
Um, what's going on?
Saving money on razors and shave gel.

No, it's... it's more than that.

Ever since that thing where you got that bra...
I don't know, um...
I felt different, I guess.
And you don't want to make out anymore and...
Have you been...

It's called a binder.
It just makes me feel more...

I didn't think that you noticed.
I was just scared that if I brought it up you'd dump me.
- What?

[sighs]
Yes.
I just... don't really know how I'm feeling these days.
Well, that I can relate to.
I'm really glad we could talk about this.
[inhales sharply]
Maybe we could keep talking about this after school?
Um, I...

Eat sushi while reading comics to each other?
- I'll even do all my best voices.

[Mr. Mitchell] Next question.
If your parents have ever separated, take a step back.
[sighs]
And final question.
And you don't have to answer this if you don't want to.
If you have ever experienced abuse... take a step back.
What, do you want me to admit that I'm messed up?
That my dad's always been right about me?

That's not what this is about, Miles.
Then what's the point of this stupid exercise?
To show you the wealth of experience that has helped you shape your unique point of view.
My diverse point of view?
Diverse does not mean lesser than.
Then what does it matter if I'm bisexual?

You don't, but it's the one that exists, and you qualify for it.
Your voice is underrepresented.
It deserves to be heard so it can help people.
Like who?
[stutters] Your writing really helped me get past the bus crash.
And you also helped Goldi accept me and Rasha.
You reached her.
I did?

I related to your play, and I'm not bi, or a white male, but I've spent a lot of time in hospitals.
[school bell ringing]
You're an interesting, talented, complicated young man.
You have stories to tell.
Thanks, Mr. Mitchell.
It could have been worse.

I still feel like we messed up our friendship.
But maybe it's for the best because it means no more flirting... at least.
Gingerbread men with pants?
"Because the opposite of no pants is pants.
I'm super sorry."
Cool, see you later, Rasha.

You know I would never send any girl a junk pic, especially not you.
- I like talking to you.

I guess that's why I got so upset.
Because I didn't want that to stop.
Well, now it doesn't have to, right?
A guy and girl can be just friends, right?

Yeah, boys and girls do it all the time.
Then, it's settled.

[chuckles]
Mmm.
Oatmeal raisin's still the best.
[scoffs] [chuckles]
Thanks for coming over.
I wanted to read you this.

"I apologize for my conduct."
You asked about ideas I was interested in.
The truth is, I'm only starting to figure out those ideas.
All my life, I've struggled with my own identity.
Whether to be what my father wants... or rebel against it.
This has left me afraid.
Afraid to be labeled.
Afraid to identify as bisexual.
But that is a part of me...
"and it's one of the many ideas I intend to explore as a writer."
You mean that?
The bisexual part of me... is the part that lets me love you.
I suppose you heard that.
I did.
[sighs]
