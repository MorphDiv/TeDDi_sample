Just because he was convicted doesn't mean he's guilty.
The only person who doesn't think he did it is you.
We live completely separate lives.
My kids, your... your... your cactus.
His advisor wants to have a parent/teacher conference next week.
I'm here.
I was hoping that this wouldn't be so complicated.
(CHUCKLES)
Dad left it to you.
I'm never going back there, Nina.
He was trying to apologize.
She was sick for a long time, and she told me that she decided to die.
You don't remember me, do you?

Are you sure she's gonna make it?
Yeah, she's just running late.
On and off for a while now.
How come you've never mentioned her?
Well, I know how sensitive you are, darling.
I wouldn't want you to be heartbroken if it didn't work out between us.
So what's she like?
You know, she's... a lot like you.
Like me?
Ta-da.
Hello, darling.
Mom?
Surprise.
Okay, what is happening here?
We're back together.
(CHUCKLES)
(LAUGHTER)
We've heard so much about you.
Well, neither have I, really, but, uh, he seems great.
Well, I'm happy to meet you guys, too.
I mean, it's taken long enough.
Congrats on your remarriage.
Okay, you're not actually getting remarried, are you?
Well, we never really finalized the divorce.
Okay, well, when did you even start talking?
Let's not discuss the details.
Ina left me, and, uh, I went back to your mom.
Aren't you happy for us, Helen?
This fella's quite a catch.
I don't understand why you kept him hidden all this time.
He's wonderful... handsome, polite, a doctor.
And at your age, Helen...
See, she's not really thinking about the words before she says them.
It's just pure stream of consciousness, what you're hearing right now.
Anyone would be an improvement after your first husband.
BRUCE: (CHUCKLES) So how is Noah?
Do they know who stabbed him?
No, they don't.
I wish I'd thought of that myself years ago.
Could've saved my family a lot of heartache.
MARGARET: (LAUGHING) He's kidding.
I don't care if he's kidding.
You can't say things like that.
He's the father of your grandchildren.
Well, he hasn't really seen very much of them recently, has he?
Doesn't make much of a difference to them if he's locked away in jail or if he's dead.
He's still very much involved in their lives.
As a matter of fact, he's coming to Martin's school tomorrow to meet with his advisor.
You're trying to impress them, not terrify them.
You should take Vik.
I'd be happy to go.
Can we please change the subject?
So how is married life treating you guys, huh?
The truth is, at the end of the day, your mother just knows me... better than anyone else ever will.
(GAGGING)
(GROANS)
(COUGHS) Ooh.
But they're entertaining.
And it's great they're back together.
Vik, my father walked out on my mother with a student and completely ruined her life, and now she's just taking him back and pretending that none of it ever happened.
And, oh, my God, all that bullshit about second chances... and how they know each other?
I'm still glad you introduced us.
It feels like a big step.
Hey...
A joint wedding.
(LAUGHS) Excuse me?
Yeah, your parents renew their vows, and we get hitched.
I'll bet your dad would even pay for it.
Think of all the money we'd save.
You are joking, right?
Of course I'm joking, Helen.
Don't have a heart attack.
You're hilarious, you know that?
Did you ever think about giving up surgery, going into stand-up comedy?
Yes, I have.
(LAUGHS)
He's not coming.
Yeah, I'm sure he's coming.
He's definitely not coming.
(HEADMASTER) Well, unfortunately, the period is now half over.
We must have our discussion with or without Mr. Solloway.
(HEADMASTER) Well, as a matter of fact, Mr. Solloway's absence provides us with a bit of a segue into the dilemma we face.
You see, our problem is that Martin, far too frequently, chooses not to come to school.
What do you mean he chooses not to come to school?
Have you been cutting class?
(HEADMASTER) We give the seniors a heavy workload to prepare them for what they'll face in college.
Now, at this rate, Martin's chances of finishing the required courses and successfully graduating in the spring, well, they're rapidly diminishing.
This is his second senior year.
Where have you even been going?
Um...
I just want you to understand what's been going on with Martin.
He's had a very difficult few years.
He was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, which is why he had to leave public school.
He was legitimately very sick.
So is that what's going on, Mr. Solloway?
Answer him.
I feel okay.
I mean it.
Don't bring him into this.
But it's been a very difficult time for the entire family.
Ex-husband.
My ex-husband is completely innocent.
I have to go to lunch.
Well, we're not done here.
(HEADMASTER) Well, I would say we are.
You know, Martin should go to lunch, and as you promised, Mrs., um...
Well, as you said, the two of you will discuss this at home.
And, Martin, I trust you understand how high the stakes are for you.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
What is the matter with you?
I mean, seriously?
I can't believe you actually thought he was gonna show up.
No, he didn't.
He just got released from the hospital.
I don't fucking care!
You shouldn't have even told him about this meeting.
He shouldn't be in our lives anymore.
He killed someone, Mom!
Why can't you just admit that?
I got to go.
(♪ DRAMATIC MUSIC ♪)

God damn it, Noah, pick up your fucking phone!

Helen.
Uh, what are you doing here?
I was in the neighborhood, and I thought I'd stop by.
Oh.
Oh, this neighborhood?
Uh, is Noah here?
You know where he is?
(GROANS) Livingston, I assume?
No, I don't think so, because I've been calling him and calling him, and his phone is turned off.
Do you think something happened to him?
What time was the meeting?
Well, noon?
Noon in the city, and... you made your way out to New Jersey hours later?
You okay, Helen?
I'm concerned about him because he was stabbed, and now he's MIA.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah.
Why does he still matter so much to you?
Because he's the father of my children, and he's blowing his last chance to have any semblance of a relationship with them.
I understand about the kids, but maybe... maybe it's best for all of you just to... let him go.
What?
My brother's fucked up, you know.
He wasn't fucked up when I met him.
(SCOFFS)
After all those years together... (LAUGHS) Yet... wow.
Yet what?
It's... it's actually... it's funny.
Excuse me?
My brother was shattered when you met him.
Our mother had just died, and I don't know if you know, but...
You know, maybe he hid it really well from you.
I knew he was grieving, Nina.
It's one of the things that drew me to him.
Helen, okay, look,
I know you thought you found a diamond in the rough that you were just gonna polish and shape and place on your dainty fingers and...
Let me tell you what actually was going on.
Noah was using you.
He was using you to get the fuck away from us, and he knew the fastest way to do that was to marry some control-freak rich girl.
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?
Didn't you find it odd how Noah didn't... didn't mind at all spending every holiday with your family, never once taking a vacation with us?
Because it was difficult for him to be with Arthur.
Why?
Because your father wasn't very nice to him, Nina.
Because he's an asshole.
He wasn't to me!
Well...
I'd... something must have happened between them.
Yes!
Okay, w-what... what was it?
My brother has been in pain, in pain for years, and you did not see it.
You know, I certainly didn't come here to get all this resentment heaped on me.
I'm sorry you're carrying around so much anger, but I have to go.
Hey, Helen.
Who was driving the car that killed Scott Lockhart?
(♪ DRAMATIC MUSIC ♪)
As far as I know, Noah was.
(♪♪♪)
And you believe that?
He confessed.
No evidence to convict him.
He basically stood up in that court, and he... volunteered to go to prison.

Can I get you glass of wine?
Um... no, I really shouldn't.
I mean, the kids are home, and it's a school night, and I-I just was gonna come by for a minute and say hi.
Yeah, I'm just gonna pour you a glass of wine.

Um... yeah, he was totally fucked up.
I mean, his mom had just died.
I know, but he didn't... talk about it.
No, no, but you could just sense it.
(SNIFFLES) Do you think Noah was using me?
Using you?
But, yeah, also, I think...
I mean, he knew who he was marrying
I don't know... all of a sudden, everyone's trying to convince me that I didn't know this man, my husband, the father of my children.
Just because things went wrong and... doesn't mean the whole story has to change.
All right, you know what?
I have... um...
I made a terrible mistake.
You need to go.
Fine.
I cannot believe I fell for this shit again.
I mean, I thought maybe... maybe this time it was about us, but it's never about us, because it's always about him.
I just want to... can I just ask you one question?
