(Episode 10)
(Restricted Area)
Why are there no documents?
How did you get in here?
It's a restricted area for police only.
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
The tone of his voice changed even though he said the same words.
The first one was of a man being sorry.
But the other one was entirely different.
He sounds pleasant as if he were complimented.
(Oh PC Room)
Can you find out... which computer has this IP address?
There is a record of the suspect... accessing the internet with this IP address.
It's that one.
What's your name?
It's Oh Dal Ja.
Do you know who Kang Mi Sook is?
I don't.
What happened?
The IP address points to that computer.
What happened?
Can you look at the SNS account?
What's this?
Why is the IP address different?
I heard clearly that it's 79 Jiso-ro, Jiso-dong.
We Fix Everything Electrical Repair Shop.
We Fix Everything Electrical Repair Shop.
We Fix Everything...
I feel pity for that "Love 8080".
It all happened because she likes you.
You creep.
It was Yang Ho Shik who blackmailed me.
What are you talking about, Officer Oh?
Calm down and explain so I can understand.
Well, it's not that simple...
I have something to ask you.
Can we talk in private?
He must be a lunatic with De Clerambault's Syndrome... or something.
We must catch him now!
No way.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I wondered why he sounded different.
He was excited at the thought of Officer Oh looking at him.
No, it's very different from what we know.
What could this mean?
Team One, this is center.
Leave Kang Mi Sook to the E-Crime Unit and come back to the station.
According to Officer Oh, the IP address was wrong.
What do you mean?
The culprit of the acid attack is Yang Ho Shik, not Kang Mi Sook.
He shared the IP address of the internet cafe... and used the account of Kang Mi Sook with a router.
That's how he's still logged in even when he's at the station now.
According to the data from Officer Oh,
Yang Ho Shik has an IQ of 150, and is a genius hacker.
But he dropped out of school after he suffered from paranoia.
Officer Park is now at the archives downstairs.
It seems he followed her there.
I knew something felt wrong.
He was putting up an act on purpose.
Hurry up.
Officer Park of Golden Time Team is at the archives... with the culprit of the acid attack, Yang Ho Shik.
She's likely under threat.
Yang Ho Shik is suffering from De Clerambault's Syndrome... and he could be assaulting Officer Park right now.
Dispatch yourself immediately.
Why are you trying to separate us?
Why?
Why?
No way.
It's... all your fault.
Who are you to treat me like a lunatic... in front of Officer Oh?
Who do you think you are?
What are you doing?
You are really...
Don't you know how much Officer Oh likes me?
How dare you come between us?
How dare you?
Whenever Officer Park steps back,
I can hear the sound of books and bookshelves.
The wavelength seems to be short and blunt.
It must be the part of the archives where it's blocked.
Detective Moo,
I think Officer Park is at the deepest section of the archives.
Why are you doing this?
Please calm down.
What would you know?
Hyun Ho and I clicked from the start.
When I was working at Club Fever,
Hyun Ho picked up... the tool I dropped for me.
And he had that gorgeous smile on.
Yang Ho Shik, please calm down.
You met Officer Oh... and you heard what he thinks about you.
You're delusional.
Delusional?
That's why you don't know anything about Hyun Ho and me.
Hyun Ho is just being grumpy.
He deleted his accounts... because he wants more love from me.
Yang Ho Shik, delusions only get worse if you run away from reality.
Life is hard, but you have to acknowledge the reality.
You should acknowledge the reality... and disappear!
Listen to me carefully.
The lunatic inside... has a mental disorder.
In case of emergency,
you have permission to fire.
Okay, open the door.
I'm just going to... pour it on your face.
I won't make you drink it like the woman from Burim-dong incident.
You should be grateful... that I'm stopping here.
Put that down, you scum.
It burns!
It burns.
Cuff him and treat the wound.
I know you like me, too.
That lunatic.
He's crazy.
Officer Park, are you all right?
Detective Moo, good work.
All things considered, with that lunatic living among us, isn't it funny that we're living without knowing anything?
I agree.
But he took scopolamine to cure his disease himself... although he put it in Officer Oh's bag secretly.
As many people live isolated from society these days, the number of mentally disordered offenders are increasing.
Even though crimes related to mental illness can be prevented... with just a little attention.
You went through a lot, Jin Hyuk.
Things keep happening one after another... in Golden Time Team.
Don't mind other's business and focus on your job instead.
Just do your job.
Wait, Jin Hyuk.
You have another opinion about it, don't you?
I'm just wondering if you have any information we can refer to.
You're going far ahead of us, anyway.
Joong Ki.
Catch Nam Sang Tae first thing before he stows away on a ship.
I already told my men to be on stakeout around possible areas.
Catch him at all cost, understood?
Let's go.
Anyway, I don't like how they're doing these days.
Is it because they work with Chief Jang or what?
Why is he calling?
The thing you told me to do last time...
Chief Jang often visited the bar, Fantasia.
I just checked that he had used Nam Sang Tae's card to go there.
You're dead meat if this is a lie.
I heard Chief Jang has been blackmailed by someone... for the video clip taken by a woman named Soo Ji.
This is trusted information from one of my reliable sources.
I barely got it by chatting him up.
Name the source.
You know I can't tell you about my sources.
The girls at Fantasia usually don't play... a cheap trick like this.
It seems the girl named Soo Ji was told by Nam Sang Tae... to play Chief Jang.
His wife and children are in Australia now.
That girl Soo Ji hit on him on purpose.
It happened six months ago.
He's been blackmailed by her for the video clip since then.
According to my sources, men at adult clubs... used Chief Jang to avoid a police crackdown.
What's important is that he's gotten involved.
Where's the girl who came on to him?
She didn't come to work for a few days... due to a bad cold.
Tabloid, you listen to me.
Find out what Chief Jang has been blackmailed for... until today.
Or the girl who flirted with him.
Get her address, understood?
Jin Hyuk, what is it?
I don't understand why he did that to me.
I think your SNS account had a bad influence on him.
I like seeing you on social media.
But I like seeing and talking to you in person like this more.
Okay.
I heard you figured out what high color laser meant.
Thank you.
You dealt with it very calmly today even though you were very startled.
Not at all.
To be honest, I was so frightened.
I barely held it back.
I wanted to... persuade Yang Ho Shik like you, but I couldn't.
I'm willing to learn more from you.
Nonsense.
Chief Jang let someone have something on him?
The man who thinks about his own safety first?
Is Tabloid probably still in contact with Nam Sang Tae?
To make you believe him?
No.
You also told me that Chief Jang is frequenting the place.
I said so because I thought he had some connection... with Nam Sang Tae.
It wasn't about blackmailing him or something.
Anyway, I can't trust anyone else before I see it myself.
The girl Soo Ji who came on to Chief Jang.
Something will turn up once I meet her.
Your friend is the best.
You friend left a big gift for me while I was asleep.
Who is it?
Yesterday...
Your dad must've been very surprised.
Be good to him.
But I didn't see his face.
I should give him my thanks.
Or Uncle Ki Won?
You know all of my friends.
Dong Woo, can you put the helper on the phone?
She went out to see her sister in front of the hospital.
Well, then put Ji Hoon's mother on the phone.
No one's here.
They all went to see a puppet show on the first floor.
Dad, can I open the gift?
I did research on the mirror placed in front of the dead body.
I think he's telling us the next target, saying that the ones reflected on the mirror are the next target.
Don't hang up the phone, okay?
What's going on?
Some guy gave him something when he was alone at the hospital.
That man said to my son... that your daddy must have been very surprised yesterday.
Contact me if anything happens, Jin Hyuk.
(Devil's Whisper)
(The world's trying to change itself in a new way.)
("Demian" by Herman Hesse)
(Moo Dong Woo)
Who are you?
(Moo Dong Woo)
Who are you?
Ghost has started the work.
(Tae Gu, let's meet up.)
(I have no choice, then.)
Mister, who are you?
Who are you?
Dad!
Dong Woo, Dong Woo!
Hello?
I think a suspicious man is with Dong Woo now.
Please go check on him immediately with security staff!
Security Team?
Dad!
Dad!
Gwon Joo, I think someone sneaked into my son's ward.
Send out a patrol right away to Ward 401 at Sungwun Hospital.
Whether Nam Sang Tae is behind this or not, someone sent a guy.
Got it?
This is center. 58 Gwangchang-ro, Gwangchang-dong,
Ward 401 at Sungwun Hospital.
A 11-year-old boy is alone, and a man has sneaked in with a weapon.
Gwangchang patrol division, mobilize immediately.
Have you spotted anything?
I've gone through all the footage from the last 35 minutes, but haven't seen Nam Sang Tae or any vehicles related to him.
Hey, do you have any updates for me?
The patrol will arrive in five minutes.
(Sungwun Hospital)
Please let go of me.
My dad will teach you a lesson.
What's going on?
Who are you?
Dong Woo!
Are you all right?
Are you okay?
Did he go this way?
A trespasser who looks Southeast Asian is on the run... using the main stairway.
The security team in the lobby, to the emergency exit immediately!
Gwangchang patrol division, are you not there yet?
I'm almost there, too!
What was your dad's phone number?
Mr. Moo!
Some Southeast Asian guy tried to...
That guy fled towards the emergency exit, and one of our security staff has been injured badly...
Those scums.
A patrol division will arrive there shortly.
And the gift Dong Woo received.
Okay, I will put it away.
Please hurry up.
Dad...
Are you all right?
My gosh, what happened?
Dong Woo, what happened to you?
(Sungwun Hospital)
That rat fled using the emergency exit.
Check all security cameras in the vicinity of the hospital.
Got it.
Gosh, what is going on?
Detective, it's the exit on the rear of Zone B-3.
Who sent you?
Is it Nam Sang Tae?
Did he put you up to this?
Answer me!
Stop!
Are you okay?
We'll be able to track Nam Sang Tae down.
Who is it?
Yesterday...
Your dad must've been very surprised.
Be good to him.
Is everyone here?
Mr. Mo is entering the building.
Mo Tae Gu is going up.
Chairman Mo.
You should have called us more often.
(Director of Land Planning Department, Kwon Jang Tae)
Is it because of Minister Kim?
No, sir.
Would you like me to leave?
Minister Kim and I... became acquainted while going to church.
We're not as close as you and I are, so don't you worry.
Now, let's have a drink.
Detective Moo, wait just a bit longer.
I've requested for a patrol division vehicle to move into the alley.
It'll catch up soon.
I'm not sure if you all know this, but the character I envy the most in the Bible is Jacob.
I prayed so hard to be blessed like Jacob... so that I could contribute to the development of Sungwun.
I prayed very hard and at last... my prayers were heard.
There is only one management philosophy to...
Sungwun Express.
Mr. Mo seems to look more handsome day by day.
"Consider yourself a falling grain of wheat..."
"and look after the poor and weak."
This is Sungwun's mission.
There's no one like our Tae Gu.
Speaking of the Surim-dong project, some scums for some useless development companies... are being irritating these days.
This is obviously causing me trouble.
If you all could possibly... provide me with a bit of support,
I would willingly bear the cross.
You know how it is for us public officials.
Gyu Ah, why don't you bring us some more dishes?
Bring us something fancy.
And get us some high-quality alcohol.
Yes, Mr. Chairman.
To be frank, the three of us here... all consider the city of Sungwun as our family.
Shall we drink to the development of... the city of Sungwun?
Yes, Minister.
I personally... am the type that likes to move up from the bottom.
I don't like to destroy someone from above.
I'm not that type of person.
I trust you, Director Kwon.
I'll get to work starting tomorrow.
(Tae Gu, I'm here.)
Please excuse me for a moment.
You've become quite humorous, haven't you?
I'm on the emergency staircase in front of Fantasia.
Shall I go to you?
No.
Prepare it for me quickly.
That one.
What do you plan to do?
Don't open the door carelessly.
Mo Tae Gu said he'd come to the second floor.
If I leave now, we don't know when we'll see each other again.
We go back 20 years, don't we?
It seems like you're upset.
Get some rest while hiding out in Japan.
Go to a hot spring while you're there.
Is it because you're going through a lot?
You smell.
Like you said, you and I are different.
But it would be unfair for me to have to leave like this.
What the chairman has given me won't be enough.
You'll have to give me some more money.
I didn't know there was a dog that bite its own master.
Do you think a master that abandoned his own dog will be fine?
I heard you paid a visit to the maniac's son at the hospital.
Madam Jang.
Have a good look at this.
He beats people up to death... and has even burned some to death.
If you continue to protect him, more people will be burned or beaten up to death because of him.
If you cooperate, we'll make sure your business doesn't get affected.
(Sungwun Regional Police, Kang Gwon Joo)
Hello?
I think he's here to meet someone.
Come quickly.
I'll be waiting for you in the office on the third floor.
I'll be there.
Detective Moo, Madam Jang called.
She said Nam Sang Tae showed up at Fantasia.
She did?
I'll join you after I catch him.
I must go meet an informant.
Please take over and fully support Detective Moo.
Inform me if something comes up.
I've forwarded the information to you.
Patrol division, mobilize to Fantasia in Youngin-dong.
Can I help you with anything?
Mr. Mo.
Where did he go?
Where did that scum go?
Come out, you scum!
I'm supposed to meet Madam Jang here, but all the lights are off.
I'm now at Fantasia, 11 Youngin-ro, Youngin-dong.
There must have been an accident here.
I don't see the caller here... and I see some blood splattered on the floor.
And Detective Moo isn't answering to the radio.
Find out what's going on as soon as possible.
All right, Ma'am.
While Detective Moo was moving from Sungwun Hospital... to Gwangchang-dong, his radio got disconnected.
Officers and patrol divisions in the vicinity, check Detective Moo's safety.
We keep trying to reach him, but he's not answering.
Where is he on GPS?
We're getting a signal near Gwangchang-dong, but it'll take a while to get the detailed information.
I'll arrive at Gwangchang-dong in 10 minutes.
Let me know as soon as you figure out his location.
Understood, Sir.
I'm now at Fantasia in Youngin-dong.
I just found a phone that seems to belong to the owner, Jang Gyu Ah, parts of a human body, and a lot of bloodstain.
Requesting for backup.
(11:00pm, murder case occurs at Fantasia, Youngin-dong.)
What happened?
Parts of a human body and Madam Jang's phone was found... on the third floor.
And the police is here.
What?
I think we're in trouble.
You're going upstairs with me.
What's going on?
Go downstairs.
We found a lot of bloodstain, parts of a human body, and...
Madam Jang's phone on the third floor of Fantasia.
She is currently missing.
When did this happen?
Ms. Kang just told us through the radio.
We're now checking the surveillance cameras and controlling the place.
Check the surveillance cameras first.
What's going on?
I'm the head of Emergency Call Center of Sungwun Regional Police,
Kang Gwon Joo.
No one in Fantasia can get out... until their identities are confirmed.
We will secure the exit.
And I need the list of people... who visited the third floor from 9pm until now... and the CCTV recordings.
All right.
Where is Detective Moo?
We found his GPS signal in Gwangchang-dong... and we dispatched Detective Shim.
We still cannot contact him.
Report back after contacting him through his radio and cellphone.
Okay, Ma'am.
(John Chapter 9, Verse 41)
I will search around this point.
So Surim-dong will now become the landmark of Sungwun.
Maybe not that much.
I just hope that more young and fresh talents... would come to Sungwun.
And help its success.
That's my wish.
With the Chairman,
Director Kwon, and I on the same side, it's bound to be successful.
Oh, my.
When he starts flattering me, alcohol seems to taste better.
You should drink, too, Director Kwon.
Yes, Sir.
Mr. Chairman, there has been an accident on the third floor.
That is...
Start talking!
In a room on the third floor, blood and Madam Jang's phone was found.
She's currently out of contact.
What?
My goodness.
How can this happen?
Now I've seen everything.
Get up.
Don't step on it.
Ms. Kang, what happened?
Who called the police?
Jang Gyu Ah called the police saying Nam Sang Tae was here.
We can't control the customers on the second floor.
They want to see the person in charge.
Joong Ki, follow me.
This way, Sir.
I'm Chief Jang of Serious Crimes Unit, Sungwun Regional Police.
There has been a murder case at a room on the third floor.
We ask for your cooperation.
The victim is missing, but evidence points to... a murder incident.
You may go home early if you cooperate to the police.
Confirm their identification.
Search carefully.
(John Chapter 9, Verse 41)
I heard someone running away.
This is the CCTV recordings.
Tidy up quickly.
What is this?
I told you that everyone should have their identities confirmed.
They were VIP customers and had an urgent business.
And they will never be involved in incidents like this.
That is nonsense.
A murder has likely been committed in here.
If you don't tell me right now...
Chief Jang, some customers have fled... through the emergency exit of the parking lot.
They are customers from the room closely linked to the third floor.
They are likely to be suspects of this incident.
Joong Ki, take over while I head to the parking lot.
Hyung Jin and Kwang Soo, follow me.
Wait.
Step aside.
I'm sorry, but you can't get in.
Step aside, now.
Step aside before things get ugly.
How dare you protect the suspects?
It's time for you to go.
Get your boss out here!
You better step aside.
Stop!
(Voice)
Why are you trying to separate us?
Why?
Who do you think you are?
Don't you know how much Hyun Ho likes me?
Disappear!
Yesterday, your dad must've been very surprised.
Be good to him.
Who is it?
Dad!
Dong Woo, Dong Woo!
This is Jang Gyu Ah.
Nam Sang Tae is here at our bar.
Come quickly.
Mr. Mo.
I'm now at Fantasia, 11 Youngin-ro, Youngin-dong.
I just arrived here, but something is wrong.
I'm supposed to meet Madam Jang here, but all the lights are off.
