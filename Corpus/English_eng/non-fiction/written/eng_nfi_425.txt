I think I can help you find Helena.

Yeah.

Yeah, they'll be safe with my ex.
Plus, my daughter will get a kick out of it.
I don't get it.

Enger's AWOL too.

Rachel must have shown the Cabal our proof of P.T.'s real identity.
Those men on the board, they're realizing they've been had.

So finally, Rachel's their target?
Well, she's certainly a liability.

He's got some big wheels coming in.

Adele's making appetizers.

And you can totally come later if you want to, I promise.
I do.

But, Mom, if P.T.'s lost the board, that means
- Neolution's on the ropes.

Delphine, you showed us what to do with it.
And we deserve a breather tonight to stand down and support Felix.

So, we spiked our gluhwein with vodka.
- Gluhwein and intrigue, nice!

And, um, Felix and I actually got some serious après-ski cred by the end of it, but Delphine was, like, all business.
What was S even doing with her out there?
- I don't know.

I have no idea.

Westmorland wants unprecedented access to human genetics, and Hashem Al-Khatib was bribing governments worldwide to get it.
But you don't have record of any of that, do you?
No, but Neolution want to sell curated, commercialized evolution to the one percent who can afford it.
So they can live forever, grow a bloody tail if they want to.

How's that sitting with you these days?
You saved my granddaughter.
I'm willing to take a gamble on nature over nurture.
This is all the supporting evidence to our claims.
Without proof of bribes, it would barely carry a news cycle.
You're a smart woman, Rachel.
Like any good CEO, you kept a shadow file, a record of where the bodies are buried.
Give me the proof I need to back this up.
Give yourself a chance to be truly free.
