Quill, the Helmet told me what I have to do.
You must never let the Cocoon be opened, ever!
I'm trusting you on this.
Wait.

What's necessary.
[Grunts]
Gamora!
I... am Groot.
Gamora made the ultimate sacrifice to protect the galaxy from the Believers.
She was a fine warrior, and I swear she shall be avenged.
[sobs]
And I swear to tear down the wall between our bunks so mine can get bigger, just like Gammy made me promise.
I do not recall such an oath.
Hey!

[sniffling] [sobs]
So much more room to sleep.
As far as I'm concerned, Gamora's still out there, and you're all wasting a whole lot of time.
Or did you forget about these?
The Quantum Bands glowed when Gamora and I were both touching them.
They're glowing now because she's trying to contact me.
Yeah, and that krutackin' thing glowed when it vaporized her.
Glowin' don't mean flarg, Quill.
Gamora's...
She's gone, okay?
[stammers, stifled sob] [crying]
I am Groot.
Ah, Groot.
You always got just the right thing to say.
Fine.

[grunts]
I am Groot.
Don't be dense.

This cryo-volcano's been dormant for centuries.
Now let's get back to the ship before my tail freezes off.
[Quill] Hold up, Rocket.
There's one more thing we gotta do:
Play Gamora's favorite song one last time.
But you said she was still alive.
That's not the point, Drax.

♪ 'Cause it took so long to bake it ♪
♪ And I'll never have that recipe again ♪
♪ Again ♪ [groaning]
You idiot!

And she loved hating this one the most.
♪ [continues] [rumbling]
Oh, man!

[all grunt]
The terrible music Quill enjoys has reactivated the volcano.
Everyone, return to the ship!
♪ [continues]
Guys, it's no big deal.

♪ [continues]
Okay, the controls are frozen up.
[grunts]
Ugh!

Let's focus on escaping before the next memorial is ours!
♪ [disco]
[Rocket] Let's jet to the ship before that cryo-volcano freezes us solid.
[yelling]
Huh?
[yelling]
Rocket!
Hang on!
Oh!
[yelling]
I am Groot!
Thanks, bud.

I am Groot!
[rumbling] [grunts]
Any bright ideas, Quill?
- And don't say another krutackin' song!

'Cause "Stairway to Heaven" is about to save your furry butt.
Ugh!

One more bar of this so-called music, and I'd fly straight into that volcano myself.
Ah, it's kind of fitting, I guess.
- Gamora loves narrow escapes.

- She...

She's still out there.
[electricity arcing]
Okay.
I may not be able to hold a memorial right, or escape an ice volcano right, but no one is ever gonna touch that Cocoon, Gamora.
[clicks]
And this drum solo's for you.
Oh!
Quill!

What happened to Gamora?
Nebula, I...

Gamora's alive!

In your pointy little muzzle, Rocket!
[Hybrid growling] [Hybrid screeching]
Oh, I guess that means the High Evolutionary's alive too.
His minions have been hunting us since we arrived.
I suggest you run.
[clang] [grunts]
Ah, Gammy, I'm gonna miss ya, but this extra elbow room will sure help soften the blow.
[crying]
- Rocket, how am I back here?

And why is there a hole in my wall?
[shrieks]
Your species has ghosts?
[stammering]
It was Quill's idea!

[panting] [growling continues] [screeching continues]
Okay, you got any bright ideas on how to get away from these things?
As my father Thanos used to say:
"You don't have to be faster than the Morag Raptor, just faster than the slowest person it's chasing."
[Grunts]
Oh, that's low, Nebula, even for you!
[growling]
Uhh...

Not the face!
[Crying out] [yelling]
- Trim your nails!

[Grunting]
Rocket, why are you attacking Quill?
That ain't Quill.

Okay, first of all, Gamora's alive.

It is as I feared, Groot.
They have both gone insane with grief.
[grunting] I am Groot.
Who you calling insane?
And why are you agreeing with him?
I believe you, Rocket.

- Where?

Me and Nebula were running from the High Evolutionary's hench-freaks when, pe-zah, I was back here again.
Uh-huh.

Well, let's see.

Bah!
[Gamora grunts]
Huh?
Gamora, you were not vaporized.
I...

It's good to see you all.
I never thought I'd ask this, but where's Quill?
Oh-ho-ho!

Whenever Quill hits those Quantum Bands together, you and him switch places!
[laughing]
Too soon?
Which means Quill is inside the Cocoon now?
- I am Groot?

We thought its energy vaporized people.
It didn't.

Oh.

That realm, uh...
It wouldn't be getting colder by any chance, would it?

Yes.

We, uh, threw the Cocoon into a cryo-volcano.
You what?
[both grunting] [thunderclap] [yells]
What could this infernal place possibly throw at us next?
Not "infernal," "glacial."
We threw the Cocoon into an ice volcano.

[huffs] [yelling] [grunts]
Didn't you hear me?

We gotta get out of here ASAP!
Don't tell me you're afraid of a little ice, human?
Nah.

[both grunt]
Never thought I'd miss getting punched in the face!
[Quill and Nebula grunt] [grunting]
Whoa!

Give me those Quantum Bands!

Well, when you put it...

[huffs]
You must be famished.

- [yelling]

[both grunting]
What is wrong with you?
The phrase you're looking for is "thank you."
- I didn't ask you to save me.

We may be enemies, but you'll always be my sister.
Maybe our feud is less than useful right now.
We'll have a better chance of surviving this place if we work together.
It started to rain giant icicles, like...
Like as big as Groot.

I am Groot.
That's when I realized we must have accidentally frozen the whole realm when we tossed that Cocoon in the volcano.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Fine.

We've still gotta get it out before Gamora freezes in there.
Still not feeling the "we" here.
[grunts]
I think this storm is actually getting worse.
At least the Hybrids can't spot us.
[distant growling] [distant screeching]
Let's hope it stays that way.
I want the High Evolutionary's ship as far away as possible from...
Nebula, the ship...
It doesn't have any ice on it.
- It's warm.

I could hate that miserable monster more.
We have to get to whatever's heating that ship.
We might be able to modify it to reheat the realm, buy the Guardians time to save us.
You save the realm, I'll thaw my hands.
Assuming you have any idea how to get up there.
[growling] [screeching] [scoffs] Never doubt a daughter of Thanos.
[both laughing]
Race you inside.
[Nebula] Oh-ho, it's on, sister!
Having trouble keeping up?

Ha!

[grunts]
Looks like I win, sister.
[Nebula] That was just the first round.
The real challenge lies ahead.
[High Evolutionary] Silence!

If you continue to distract me, Yondu,
I will have you reduced to a pleasantly variegated smear.
Now let me finish recharging the heating core, and then we can see what your paltry genetic makeup has to offer me.
If we can take the power core and turn it on full blast, the energy differential should be enough to drain that pompous psychopath.
Then we funnel the heat out all at once and hopefully thaw the realm.
That's a temporary solution at best, if your Guardians can't retrieve the Cocoon from the cryo-volcano.
Relax.

Easy.

Okay.

Just give me a little more slack.

Whoa!

[yells]
Whoa!
[Yelling]
Rocket, don't lower the winch yet!
[yelling] [yells, grunts]
Quill!
Rocket!

- I am Groot!

Oh, krutack.
Sorry, Gammy.
Ohh...
Oh!
[Grunts]
Quill, get us outta here!
If you intruders wish to share in my ship's heat,
I have a specimen cage ready for you.
[yells]
I meant teleport us, you idiot!
[growling] [Hybrid screeching]
Hybrids, detain them!
[sneezes]
I am Groot.
I said I was sorry.
Saying it again ain't gonna thaw her out any faster.
My comfort's not important.
I have to retrieve the Cocoon before everyone inside it freezes.
Yeah, but you don't gotta be stupid.

Two separate energy fields with a vacuum between them.
Keeps heat in and ice out.
What do we do if Quill makes another surprise visit.
You mean when he messes this whole thing up?
Don't worry.

[panting]
Oh, man!

- [yelling]

If you can't figure out how to save us, I will!
[screaming]
- Nebula?

Groot, we're gonna need to modify the plan.
[gasps]
Huh?
[growling]
Oh!
[grunts] [grunts]
Another stowaway.

How very tragic.
[gasps] [gasps]
[gasps]
Insulated force field.

[grunts]
Stop her!
[Screeching] [grunts] [grunting]
Get off!

[Grunts]
You're too stupid to use the bands to save your own skin, you don't deserve to wield their power!
[yelling] [yells] [both straining]
She's got a point, Quill.
Yeah.

[grunting]
Come on!
Not the Quantum Bands!
[Grunts] [yells] [gasps]
Whoa!

- Go!

[grunting]
[both screaming]
[screeching]
[Nebula screaming]
[breathing heavily]
What did my sister do now?
I am Groot!
Ugh!

You can't want to stay here, you miserable shrub!
We don't got much time.
Get down there, grab the Cocoon, and don't ask questions!
- And I will pilot the ship.

I said "don't ask questions," not "say the dumbest thing possible."
You are the galaxy's worst pilot!
I have been practicing.
We're on autopilot.

I do not have to do nothing, therefore I do have to do something...

Huh?
Just a little lower.
[grunts]
[grunts] [beeping]
I have the Cocoon.

I do not know what that flashing means.
But Drax the Destroyer will not be defeated by buttons.
The forecast calls for a heat wave.
[rumbling] [all grunt]
Drax, the ship's icing up!
You wanted to do something.

[Drax] Fear not.

Yeah, th...

Let me go!

I am Groot.

28, 27...
I better get up to the cockpit.

- No, he don't.

Well, too bad!

See, I was almost too late to do this...
Rocket!
[Yelling]
And that could've thrown the whole plan off.
[grunting]
Rocket, what am I supposed to do now?
You might wanna tie that around your waist.
Just sit tight until I say so.
[Gamora] This isn't the type of place I wanna sit at all!
Yeah, we all gotta make sacrifices.
Three, two, one...
No!

I am Groot!
Huh?
[Screaming]
Whoo!

Yeah, perfect plan, Rocket!
It's just but one quick thing:

Don't get your hairless hide in a whirl.

Now help out and fire-blast her arms.
[weapon firing] [grunting]
Gently.

Groot, if you have a plan, now's the time.
I am Groot.

I am Groot!
No!
[Grunts] [grunting]
No!

[Screams] [laughing]
All right, Groot!
Can we time an escape, or what?

You didn't give up on me, Quill.
[loud thud] [all grunt]
The button defeated me!

It's all right, Drax.

I promised I'd make sure that Cocoon never opened, and I'm gonna do just that.
Even if it means...

[gasps]
Now, we asked if you found anything else in the Sarcophagus, and you said...
No.

See?

We've gone over this before.
You can keep this safe, correct?
Nova Corps headquarters has the best temporal stasis fields in the galaxy.
Once we get it to Xandar, this thing's never gonna open.
You have my word, which is actually worth something.
Really?

If I were you, Rocket, I'd worry less about units and more about sleeping arrangements.
[laughs nervously] G-Gammy... [teeth chattering] [shuddering]
Next time I'm leaving her in the Cocoon.
[loud shuddering]
