What is it?
It's a gift from us to your father.
Oh, God.
Oh my God.
Where did you find this, honey?
Well, Moira told me it was down at the post office,
The Van Housens found it in their storage room and thought that we should have it.
(shocked gasps)
Who's the lady in the back?
It's Moira.
Flattering.
It's a family portrait, Roland.
Oh... you...
It's so weird, I don't even remember posing for this.
Because you didn't.
You were in rehab when we sat for this.
I wasn't in rehab,
I was at rehab visiting Stavros.
Oh, that's right.
We had your face painted on the body of my assistant.
(fake chuckle)
Well, I love it.
Let's get this inside.
20 bucks, I'll give you a hand taking it in.
What do you want?
40 buck and I'll help you in with in.
I can keep going up.
Can play this game all day, pal.
I can't tell if this room is just very, very small, or if the portrait is very, very big.
Well, I think it's quite possible both are true.
(sighs) Do you think the Van Housens had it enlarged?
No, Th-this is the actual size.
Remember, Reiner wanted to paint it twice as big.
Oh, look at it, John.
Well, don't worry, we'll... we'll find a place for it.
Ah, you know, we can... take things off a wall, or... mm... rearrange some furniture.
Maybe move some wigs.
Oh John, I know how nostalgic you still get for the old days, and I just wanted to do something thoughtful for you.
Oh, Moira, this portrait is a wonderful reminder of your generous spirit and the... enormous strength of this family.
Aw...

(hammering outside)
Um, is that your juice?
It's just that I don't normally share beverages with people.
I see. (chuckles)
So, hey, I was thinking about our, ah, our launch party, and I think we should take out like a full page in the local news, and just make it a... make it a thing, you know.
Mm... um...
Well, do you not think people are gonna show?
Yeah. 'Cause um, 'cause I was thinking what if we did like a soft launch.
Um, and you know, just test the store out on a small group of people.
Did like an exclusive VIP guest list, and offered, you know, a friends and family discount as incentive.
Ha, now it's sounding like you don't think people will show.
No, I do.
I do think, um, that people will come.
It's just, you know, I look to like...
Gwyneth who soft-launched the 'goop' newsletter and now it's a thriving lifestyle publication slash empire, and...
I have no idea what you're talking about, but it's up to you.
Ah, either way you do need to call the electrician to hang these lights that were supposed to be up a week ago.
I was waiting for a call back from him.
I'm gonna follow up.
Sure.
Can I have my juice back, please?

She said that her cat is better.
She doesn't have a cat.
Um, somebody isn't coming in today and someone's cat is better.
Oh, and someone's something may be worse...
Is everything okay?
You usually take down the messages, even if you forget to give them to me.
It's just that my grades are being posted today so I'm just kind of avoiding the computer.
Well, that's not really an option so how about I'll just look for you.
No, it's okay, I can do it.
It's just that if I fail I may need the afternoon off.
Also not an option, but I will be here for you if it's bad news.
Oh my God, Ted.
No, Alexis, those are the class averages.
You got a 63 and a 68!
Oh my God!
- (happy laughter) - (excited squealing)
Um, I'm just gonna, um...
I'm just gonna call Mrs. Syzlak, and just make sure that her cat's doing okay.
Hmm... 'Kay.
- ♪ - _
Did it grow?
Can we cover it with something or...?
Can we help you, David?
Uh, yes.
Actually I wanted you to be the first to know that Patrick and I will be launching the store this Friday.
It's actually a very effective business strategy.
And it's always better to go under.
David, if the business is foundering it's best to tell us now.
Yeah, I don't know if that's true, son.
Every Rose video we opened had fireworks.
Okay, well, this is gonna be the opposite of that.
We're inviting a select group of VIP's, and offering a 25 percent friends and family discount.
Well, that's what we're doing.
Well, what if your mother and I go in and buy something together?
Does that mean we get a 50 percent discount?
Why would you wanna spend less money at my store?
David, we are happy to support this modest little vigil you're hosting but to hand out discounts before the store has even birthed it sounds a tad defeatist.
I hope you don't mind if I keep this information to myself.
I don't want you to share the news.
The smaller the better.
Oh, rarely has that been a recipe for success.
I'm really glad I came in here.
(light knock)
Hello.
Um, I called Mrs. Syzlak, and sorted it all out.
She will be in tomorrow.
So, I'm just gonna go back to my desk, which is where I work.
Uh, we should talk about the kiss.
Definitely.
Personally, I don't think it was that a big deal.
Like when parents kiss their friends... ju... on the mouth.
That's exactly what I was gonna say.
Agreed. (chuckles)
And I know that you love discounts, so, I was thinking that maybe we could go...
I would go as family, and you would go as friends... of the family.
Well, I do love discounts. (chuckles)
In fact they had to delete Groupon from my phone last week, just 'cause three vacuums is enough... vacuums.
So um... back to work-o.
♪
I always felt something was missing in here and then it occurred to me that... a lot of family-run businesses hang a portrait of the family in the workplace.
I've been meaning to have my family portrait airlifted in...
Well, I know it's a little arresting at first, but I think with time you won't even know it's here.
You don't look very happy in this.
Well, it wasn't the style to look happy.
The motivation was to look successful.
You know this used to hang in the great hall of our house.
Oh, now this seems a little understated for a great hall.
I'd look at it every morning.
The family often wasn't all together back then, but, uh, I could look at this and there we were.
Well, you guys are together, like, all the time now, so, who needs this,
But, this happens to be one of the only possessions that... wasn't sold off.
Why does it seem like Mrs. Roses eyes are... following me?
Oh, she paid extra for that.
Big store opening?
Isn't it a friends and family sale.
Yes.
Which is why you would be invited as a friend.
Listen, uh, Gwen wanted me to ask you
Er, if... if we both have plus-ones for the opening, or do we have to be each other's plus-ones.
Who's Gwen?
(laughs)
That's very funny.
Oh, my mother's boyfriend wanted to bring his secretary.
He did?
But I'm really glad that someone told you.... um... and Bob... and Gwen.
(car rumbles)
(footsteps thud)
(door creaks open)
Uh... how many people did you tell about Friday?
Uh, because I have been approached by a lot of people who are not on the pre-approved list.
Well, you know, sometimes when you tell everyone that it's exclusive, then everybody just wants in.
Like how many people are we talking about?
(inhaling whistle)
Well, looks like this soft launch is firming up a bit, huh.
But it's not supposed to be firm.
Well, with this many people it's definitely at least semi-firm.
And that's something, that's what I just said to you, so...
What...?
(quietly excited laughter and chatter)
Oh my God.
Hey, back of the line, bro!
That kind of language, folks, will not be tolerated at Rose Apothecary.
Thank you.
(doors creak open and shut)
Uh, so I was just verbally assaulted by a very off-brand customer in line outside.
Well, David, I have really underestimated you.
How so?
Who knew you had so many friends, or, uh, family members,
It's going to be fine.
Watched a lot of YouTube tutorials.
This is very impressive.
Well, there is a good chance I didn't wire that properly, so that's why I also got the insurance that you forgot to get.
Are we ready to do this?
Open the doors.
Okay...
(clears throat then whispers) Softly.
Okay.

Find everything okay?

(cash register beeping)
Wow.
David did all this?
I can't believe it.
He's managed to create, in this town, something truly winsome.
I would shop here, John.
Even without a nagging sense of obligation.
- (Moira gasps) - 'Rose Apothecary.'
The Rose name on another plucky young business.
We should go congratulate him.
We should but... our son is very hard at work.
So um, this says foot cream on it.
What happens if I use it on my hand?
Um, I'm pretty sure your hands are gonna be fine.
Okay, and it's like 50 percent off if Jocelyn and I both buy it at the same time?
Um, David, I need to ask ya a little question about this baggy of Joshua tree tea?
Geez, I didn't realize this place was a front.
It's not a front.
That is a tea that Mr. Hockley makes out of a greenhouse on his farm.
And now that I've said it out loud, I might have to double check.
Started drinking tea in high school.
(birds chirp)
Cedar dragon. (spritzes)
I mean, it's nice but I also, I don't know.
I think you should probably get it or not, whatever...
Alexis and...
Good to see you, Mr. and Mrs. Rose.
I take it that Alexis has told you the big news?
No, ah, actually I was talking about you passing your exams.
Alexis, what a delightful surprise!
Not that I'm surprised.
I had nothing but doubts...
Well, I'm just glad to be done.
♪
You know, I had an idea about what to do with the portrait.
I was thinking, to save space, we could cut our faces out and make four smaller, individual portraits.
We could... here's another thought:
we bid it farewell.
Are you kidding?
Doesn't fit, John.
And I don't just mean literally.
We aren't those people anymore.
We are, but we aren't.
You know, you might be right.
It's funny when I look at that portrait now,
I find myself wondering...
Were we really that happy back then?
Oh, deliriously happy.
Oh, and I miss that beach house.
Oh my God, I still dream that we wake up in our old bed.
We have to focus on what we do have.
No?
Yes.
Yes.
(car rumbles)
Oh.
Uh, no, it's a... it's a pencil shaped like a twig.
I got it at the store.
Wasn't that was sneaky of you.
I will definitely try to use this.
It looks very delicate.
Yeah, it's a lot more expensive than I thought, too.
I hate it when they don't put price tags on things.
Thank you, Ted.
Oh, no...
That was supposed to be like, um... like a thank you adult kiss.
Even adult ones.
Of course.
Probably better if we just adult hug and adult work together.
I totally get that.
Okay.
Great.
Adult high five?
Yeah.
- ♪ - (David sighs)
(light Jazz song plays)
Well, this was a success.
Although, you know, we'd be, ah, 25 percent richer
If we just done a hard launch.
But hey, I'm just a numbers guy.
That is true.
Congratulations, man.
Congratulations to you.
(lights flicker)
Well, it fits here.
I wonder what else the Van Housens took from us.
Don't waste your time thinking about those human vultures.
I think they did us a favour.
They sent us a reminder that it's not always good to hold onto the past.
Speak for yourself, I look super cute.
Okay, that's not actually your body though.
Um, okay, but it's my face, David.
Okay, let's go.
There's something really weird happening with mom's eyes.
It's like they're following me.
(chuckles)
