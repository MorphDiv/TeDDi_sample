[yawns] [sniffs]
So, uh, what are we doing?

Do you not see the phone to my ear?
I-

I said, I-- You think this is some sort of joke?
Maybe the one about the interrup...ting cow?

Shut up.

Listen, you had just better put Mr. Vandertunt on the line this instant!
Well, then, go find him.

Oh.

Hello?

What?

[growls loudly] [growls]
Seriously.

He-- Let me guess!
He said he didn't believe that I'd been kidnapped.

Has this happened before?
No.

Well, he-- Hey, do you need me for this?
Yes!

Your point being?

You can sleep when you're dead.

Because Len Trexler is going to be left holding a very empty bag on this.
And to make that happen, I need you to drive out to Vandertunt Castle and convince the old man I'll mail her home in several different boxes.
[growls] But not really, though, right?

No!

Look...

Ah, and the universe provides.

Okay, so, once I'm out there, [pills crunching] how am I supposed to convince Vandertunt you're serious?
Take him a finger.
Huh?

No!

I'm not taking him anybody's finger.
I'm just trying to save you a trip.

I mean, you don't want to drive all the way out there just to have him say,
"On second thought, to make this happen, we're going to need a finger."
Nobody has ever said, "To make this happen, we're going to need a finger."
Oh, you'd be surprised.
[shudders]
The last thing I wanted to get mixed up in is a kidnapping, even one as phony as a three-dollar bill.
Because doing a stretch in jail would be the least of my worries.
Vandertunts have enough juice in this town to make sure
I never even see the inside of a cell.
So I am not looking forward to this.
Plus I bet that creepy old joint's as haunted as Mrs. Muir's twat.
Hmm.

Oh, also, when I said I'd take you to the bus station... [tires screeching] [man yells] [exclaiming] [laughing]
[Figgis] Typical Archer.
Figures he'd be a goddamn slob.
Uh, I think maybe somebody tossed the place?
Oh.

Wonder what they were after.
Who knows?

Why-- I was gonna say "flap-hammered."
Why do you constantly bring that up?
What, Archer hammering your wife?

In her flaps?

[muffled audible shrug] [sighs] Okay.
Well, we're not gonna find any clues to lead us to Charlotte Vandertunt in this dump, so let's--
Yeah.

[mock gasp] And if we don't know where she is?
It's... frustrating?
No.

Uh-huh.

Yep.

Ohh.

But on some level, it's also gotta be pretty frustrating.
Not as frustrating as you!
In the meantime, she was at Dreamland with Archer the other night.
[line ringing] So go snoop around, see if you turn up anything.
[chuckling] Besides a cold brewski, am I right?
Hello?

Damn it, I don't care if the number's unlisted!

Thank you.
That worked?

Yes, hello.

[wheezy, gravelly voice] Please hold the wire.
I apologize for the heat.

But that's how Father prefers it.
Can he hear us?
Oh, yes.

[loudly] Father, say hello to Charlotte's kidnapper.
No, no-- I-I-I didn't kidnap her.
I'm just sort of a go-between.
A fine distinction, legally speaking.
I know, but look, I'm just trying to make sure she gets home safely.
In exchange for one million dollars.
According to the person, or persons, who asked me to deliver the message.
Whom I'm sure she's boring senseless with her constant raving about incest.
Uh, I wouldn't know about that.

I know what it is. [quietly] Did you know it's forbidden?
Everybody knows it's forbidden.
Oh, you'd be surpri-- Yes, Pelham?
[wheezy, gravelly whispering] Mm-hmm.

Ohh.

Yes, I think a finger should suffice.
Oh, is he taking drink orders?

Like, a whole handful.

Deeply.

Finish your call, Pelham, and then Mr. Archer needs a drink.
I hate to say "need."
Well-- Yeah.
Pelham has had the most interesting telephone call.
Tell me, Mr. Archer, does, or do, your person, or persons, possess an accent vaguely Germanic?
That's pretty confusing, but no.
Most confusing, yes, because such a person is on the telephone just now, claiming that he is the kidnapper.
"He"?

Yes, even Charlotte isn't stupid enough to get herself kidnapped by two different kidnappers at once.
Well-- Which means one of you is lying.
So I'm afraid I shall have to ask for proof you actually have Charlotte.
What kind of-

Yes.

I-I could bring you her.

Mmmmmmmmmmm, no.
I-

Mmmm, well, now, that could work.

Just make sure that she's holding the newspaper with nine fingers.
Aw, goddamn it.
Well, actually seven.

You know, not counting her thumbs.
And then, obviously, bring me her severed finger and the photograph so that I may compare the two.
[sighs] Yeah.

Father, say good-bye to Charlotte's ostensible kidnapper!
[sighs] So I guess that's a no on the bourbon?
Yes.

[sighs] Where the hell am I supposed to find a finger?
Hello?

Hey, listen to me.

Well, I'm very sorry to hear that.
Well, too bad, because-- Because you're getting it, whether you want it or not.
So, let's get to it, shall we?
No.

I didn't know, okay?
I thought this was gonna be, like, some pull-on fake feet, man, not-- not--
Oh, sweet Jesus Lord God Christ, not some freaky metal robot legs!
[meows] That'll do, Schnuckiputzi.
[meows] And also, it's not just the legs.
No, you crazy Kraut bastard, I don't want any part of those parts!
But your employer, Mr. Trexler, does.

Look, I'm just following orders.
What?

Okay, yeah, tell me about Nazis.
[grunting] [slurred] What is taking so long?
[speaking German]
[meows]
I said, that will do!
[purring] [slurping]
Mm.
Mm.

I should be looking for my partner's killer, but instead I'm looking for a damn finger.
[tires screeching] [belches] [gulps, belches] [hot dog thuds]
[Poovey grunts] [body thuds] [body being dragged] [sawing] ♪ [Krieger humming]
[sawing stops] ♪ [humming stops] [sawing resumes] ♪ [humming resumes]
[sighs] [speaking German] [air-raid siren in distance] [sighs]
[sighs]
Well,
I hate to say I told you so.

No.

Hang on.

I live in the ten-room penthouse apartment upstairs.
Oh.

What do you think?

Hardy-har-har.
If you need a finger, just take one.
But-

Man, that septum is deviated, huh?
That's not her.
[Archer] Poovey?

Tried to break into the club first thing this morning.
I assume looking for Drooling Beauty over there.
Yeah, you really threw a monkey wrench into Figgis' plan.
His plan?

Why?

For what?

For the sex slaves Trexler was gonna--
Oh, I get it!
Do you?

Isn't it?

Exactly.

Son of a-

So now I gotta go find a goddamn finger?
And if I were you, I'd take one of her rings to put on it.
They say the devil's in the details.
And silk pajamas.

Get up, you lummox!

Wuzza-

Get up, dummy.

You better pray to God it wasn't you who hit me, because whoever it was... hits like a weak little bitch of a girl, who was born with some kind of little bitch of a birth defect,
so that instead of a fist, she just has this tiny little bitch of a... nubbin.
And I guess I'll drive, since you clearly have a concussion.
Yeah, not feeling great.
[smacking lips] [gulps] Ahh.
You know you're killing me, right?

Figgis is counting on that ransom money.
I can't double-cross him again.

Because if he finds out, somebody's gonna find me in a hole in the desert.
[laughs] No, they're not.

Look, it's your own fault for doing right by all those Chinese broads.
Talk about no good deed.

And now I need you to help me do another good deed.
Defraud an old man out of a million dollars using a severed human finger.
And reunite a family.
Of daughter and sister-bangers.
Alleged daughter and sister-bangers.
[sighs] [muffled] Well, let's go to the morgue.
That's the spirit.

I said, I'm looking for a corpse.
White, female, mid-30s, fresh, within, say, the last 12 hours.
Jesus Christ, every full moon.
Beat it, ya sicko, before I call the cops.
I am the cops, asshole!

Well, maybe lead with that, huh?
Just buzz me in, ya hump.

What is it, National Hot Dog Day?

There isn't one.

Can you...

Missing persons, yeah.

Your jerk-off partner's already back there.
[sighs] Our what?
Eyeglasses, dark hair, gray at the temples, mouth like somebody used a tomato capper to scoop out a pig's asshole and glued it under his nose?
Aw, shit!

Are you nuts?
Do you wanna get caught?

Now shut up, put these on, and follow my lead.
Aw, jeez.

[sighs] Sorry, lady.
But if you think about it, which I guess you can't, this whole thing is Archer's fault, so... [muffled gag] [whispering] Will you get in position?

[quietly] Okay!

Okay.

On one, two...
Ohhhh... [crunch] [disgusted groaning]
[Archer, in English accent] Great Scott!

Don't you move, you sick bugger!
No-

You're damn right you will-- to the bobbies!
By which I mean the police!
I am the police.
Well?
Well, whaaa--
Holy shit!

I can't believe it took you so damn long.
What, are you hourly?

[muffled] No.

Where the hell did you get that?
It was just sitting there.
That could've been inside somebody.
[muffled grunting] [gulps, sighs]
Well, it is now.
[belches]
Anything, whatever, a little box.
[Poovey] Aren't we supposed to put it in milk?
But-

Yeah, that makes more sense.

[chuckles] I actually have some thoughts on that.
He'll freeze to death in there!
No, he won't.

Oh.

[chuckling] Strip him.
Really wish we hadn't have done that.
I can never unsee him naked.
I mean, the size of that thing.
Hollow that big bastard out, you could use it for an umbrella stand.
Ugh!
Goddamn it!

[Cecil] Oh, I suppose I'm just surprised.
Why?

It's really in there?

Mmmmmmmmmm, no.
I'm sorry?
I trust you.

[shouting] Father, do you wanna see
Charlotte's ostensible severed finger?
No.

Are you-- This could be anything!
It could be a piece of a hot dog!
Eww!

You say it's her finger, I take you at your word.
And I assume you'll be in touch shortly with complicated instructions for the exchange of the ransom money for my horrible sister?
I mean...
[Mother] Good.
Then it's all settled.

I'll expect the ransom within 24 hours, so you'll see to that.
But-

All in good time, Mr. Archer.
Right.

Is it just me...

[device ratcheting] [vital signs monitor beeping] [sighs] Almost there.
So close.
[distant explosions] [speaking German]
[sighs]
Oh!
[sighs]
[chuckles]
[both gasp] [weapons cocking]
[cat]
[gasps]
[whistles] [clacking] [growling] [general, men]
[barking, growling] [shouting in German] [men yelling, screaming]
[screaming continues] [growling continues] [meows, purrs]
[crying]
[explosions grow closer]
[explosions continue]
[dogs growling, snarling] [nurse screaming] [clicking tongue] Tu-tu.
[meows] [purring] Yeah, you're just a widdle whore for the cuddles, huh?
Okay, I gotta get some sleep.
You be a good girl.

Yeah, you're a good girl.
