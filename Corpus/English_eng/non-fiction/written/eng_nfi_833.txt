You'll survive, Dries.

There's only one police chief as far as I'm concerned, you.
Things won't be the same without you.

Aren't you going to wear the Hugo Boss?

He wore the same jeans and socks when he became police chief.
How do you know?

Hey.

Two minutes.

One minute, Jan.
Come on, Verbeek.

You may have noticed that Twitter exploded this afternoon.
It was detonated by the VPV's press conference.
The most popular hashtag, even outdoing pop stars and football players, is janforpresident.
He is giving us his very first political interview.
Ladies and gentlemen, worshipped by some, vilified by others, here is the Police Chief, or should I say former Police Chief, of Antwerp Drugs Squad, Jan Verbeek.
Mr Verbeek.

Take a seat.

Good afternoon, everyone.

I'd like to introduce you to Jan Verbeek and I'll hand you straight to him.
Thank you very much.

And am doing so in order to stand for parliament for the VPV.
Jan will be given the second seat in the Chamber.
Jan Verbeek entering politics, I didn't see that coming.
Did you read my book?

Then surely it's not that much of a surprise?
What Has To Change.

So exactly what has to change, Mr Verbeek?
A lot of things.

An awful lot of things need to change in this country.
Many have gone before you, Mr Verbeek.

I said I was going to clean up Antwerp and people had a lot to say about that then too.
We're now ten years down the road and the results speak for themselves.
Yes, but you and your unit are behind more than 6,000 years of prison sentences for drugs of fences.
That seems an impressive number but actually I think it is far too few.
Explain.
Look.

Criminals are protected.

We need to be rigorous and simply abolish the Lejeune law on parole.

Yes, but...

One of the recurring criticisms heard, including following publication of your book, is that what you say is racist.
Dries?
Inspector Dries Ben Haisa, my right-hand man and trusted friend.
Ben Haisa.

In Antwerp someone of Moroccan descent is ten times more likely to be stopped and searched on the street by your officers.
If we discovered tomorrow that most of the drug dealing is in the hands of women in fur coats from Brazil, I'd have them stopped and searched more often too.
Right.

What made the most impression on me is that you are very ambitious but I must say a couple of passages scared me rather.
But never mind.

I scare you, Mr Heyvaert?

I think we live in two different worlds.

No, I'm going to ask you a question.

May I ask you one more question?

Do you?

For the past ten years I've devoted myself to ensuring your safety, your children's, your grandchildren's.

Let me finish.

I know...

There are others you should perhaps be scared of.

I will still devote myself to guaranteeing your safety, your children's and your grandchildren's.
That is my aim.

Our time is up.

Tomorrow there will be another Word Against Word.

Mr Jan Verbeek.

So how did it feel?

It went well.

The way our baseline shifted...

The militants are going crazy.
Prepare for an amazing reception at our election congress the day after tomorrow.
You're expected at the radio station now.

Hello.

Mr Hendrickx, it's an honour to meet you.

Duty calls.

Jan Verbeek.

Uh, Jan Verbeek, technically, you are still our chief for a few hours.
True?

My informer called.

They make a type of MDMA, an advanced kind, ten times as strong.
Where?
We'll soon find out, it's this evening.

Ozgür.

Ozgür fucking Karagüs.

Our present.

Ours.

Doesn't matter whose present it is.
What do you reckon?

BLIND SPOT
Can you confirm that Ozgür is in the car?

He's driving.

OK, chief.

And if they leave our sector?
Have we got tucking authority or not?

What do you reckon, Brussels or Charleroi?
Charleroi.

That's what happens when you leave it to Ruud.

Hey, Jan, which is worse, a junkie or a Walloon?
A Walloon.

Dries?
Johan, turn your lights off.
Dries, where are you?
Dries?
Now what?

It's OK.

Where?

Look it up.

No, no, that's 4 1/2.
Come on, you pansies, stop playing cards.
Radios on 3?

YES.

Ruud, you're coming with me.

It's my last evening.

OK.

First floor, clear.
Two dead ground floor, chief.
Don't move.

Clear.
Jan, he's OK, he's my informer.

OK?
And?

What d'you mean?

And Ozgür?

Gone?

Don't make excuses.

Nice mess we're in.

Five dead, no drugs, no lab and no fucking Ozgür.
Nice party.

Sorry...

Good thing I didn't bring all the media with me.
Search them.

I don't care.

Jan, we're...

Search till you find something.

OK.
Dries?
Nothing.
Hands up.

Up high.

Up high.

Here.
Ozgür?

Do you speak French?

English?
What?

Look at me.

Do you want to go back to Syria, monkey face?

We're brothers.
What did he say?

No, chief.

Where are the drugs?

I'm not your brother.

I'm not like you.

I'm gone tomorrow.

Charleroi police.

The informer is ours, he's coming with us, to the hospital.
Yeah.
Shall we?
Right.

Yes, a lot more.

Try to speak into the camera when you reply.

It's just for the montage.

Jan Verbeek is much more than a colleague.
Jan is the only one who gave me a second chance.
Without him I'd be on the street or in hospital or in prison.
I'd have stolen that camera by now.
What?

If it's not funny, then don't laugh.

Jan is more than my chief.

I've heard some people say Jan Verbeek is racist.
He's not.

It's true the Moroccan community is a source of problems.
You can't deny it.

No.

OK?

Thank you.

Dries.

No, D R I E S. A Flemish name.
OK.
He really wasn't happy.

Oh no.

It is time to hand over a really heavy present.
Oh.

I don't believe it.

They thought they'd aimed at his heart.

They didn't know Jan hasn't got a heart.

He hasn't got a heart.

It's the original, framed.

Yes, but... it is for you.

There's another present.

Yes, here.

Here.

Well, I wonder...

A Dutch-Arabic dictionary.

Idiot.

I need to speak to you.
Later.

Here...
May I have your attention?
Hey!

Our colleagues from Charleroi just called.

Yes, they'd like to congratulate us on this evening's "successful" operation.
They also asked if we can get our radios repaired as soon as possible.
So we can at least inform them next time we enter their territory.
As your new police chief I plan to make a few changes.
One is that the camera in the interview room will be working again from now on.
OK, fine.

What camera?
That the camera in the interview room will be working again from now on.

Yeah, yeah.

And now we have arrived at the real reason for this evening.
Those who know me know how much respect I've always had for my predecessor.
Can I ask you to join me, Mr Jan Verbeek?
Thank you.
It's with handshakes and everything.

Really?

Right then.

You may.

There you are.

I'll manage.
This is the best day of my life.

Then you must have led a very miserable life.

Mr Jan Verbeek.

Thank you.

Once a cop.

Once a cop.

Exactly.

I started here 25 years ago.
I was your age, Dries.

We've shared our joys and sorrows.
Celebrated Christmas and New Year together.

You are my family.

And I'm proud... proud of what we've achieved together in recent years.
Proud to have been your chief.

But I want you to know that I'm not going to abandon you.
If it's up to me, and it's my turn now, it's over, starting tomorrow.
No more ministers who promise more cops on the streets and then cut our budget behind our back.
It's over.

No more judges who are always much harder on us than on the criminals.
Yes.

And no more...

Those innovators who say from behind their desk how a cop must behave on the street.
That's over too.

That'll do.

Ruud, that'll do.

Dear friends, for years we've asked politics to take an interest in the police.
Well, from tomorrow onwards the police are taking an interest in politics.
Thanks, my friends.

Let's go for it!
Jan?

Party's not over yet.

I'm going to get a drink.

That was in the informer's pocket.
Has anyone else seen this photo?
No one?

I have to be sure no one else has seen it.

OK.

Jan?

Trust me.
Mr Verbeek?

HOSPITAL
Chief.

OK.

Dammit.
Come on, Dries.

No questions, just do as I say.

How do you know Carole?
How do you know Carole?
Is she your mother?
Did she send you?
How old?

How old are... you?
Shit.
Not now.

No, no, no, no.

Fuck.
Go away, pal.

Mr Verbeek?

Fucking hell!
What are you doing here?

Shame you didn't come a bit earlier.

If the doctor says it's OK, I want to question Ozgür.
The CCTV system is broken.

Listen carefully, you bastard.

The police chief wasn't here, OK?

I've deleted all the CCTV images, so no one will contradict you.
Someone knocked you out.

I saw the police chief.
What are you going to say?

I've got one question.

I want to know who screwed me.
My two brothers are dead.
And I want to know why you're helping me.
You were injured.

Someone knocked you out there.

Is that your statement?

It's strange it's in the same hospital where an officer was stabbed to death and where there's an informer you shot.
Shall we take a look at the CCTV images?
I've got time.

Here.

Mr Verbeek?

I want to see him.

Oh, fuck.
Police Chief Verbeek?

Can you turn that torch off?

May we know what you're doing here at this time of night?
I'm having a rest.

Yes, in a car park.
Don't start, chief.

Control, can you put me through to Police Chief Mertens, please?
Police Chief Mertens?

OK, fine.
Mr Verbeek, I'll have to ask you to come with us.

What?

There's an APB out on you.
I'm not leaving my car here on its own.
He says he doesn't want to leave his car here.
Just because you are an ex-police chief doesn't mean you can...
Tell that bastard of a colleague of yours to calm down.
That'll do.

It's fine here.

You drive in front of me in your van and I'll follow you.

Calm down.

I apologize.
Good morning.
Hi, how are you?
Right.

I insisted I be allowed to question you.
Seriously?

What an honour.
What was all that about?

That's not the great Jan Verbeek we know.

You'll get used to it, Jan.
I want to know why you knocked over that journalist.
What happened before that?
Something must have to make you freak out.
And decide to spend all night in a car park...
What is all this?

You left here around half past two last night?
I don't know.

You know the way.
But you only got home at 4 o'clock.
Like I said, I didn't look at the time.
Tell me where you went, Jan.
I just took my time.

Right.

Sorry?

What, eh?

Your failed operation in Charleroi, your very last.
People are killed, injured and Ozgür gets away from you.
I know you.

You went to the hospital again to question the informer and then what happened?
The officer by his door was stabbed.

What?

Is he dead?

When I look at the CCTV images what am I going to see?
Haven't you looked?
No.

Yeah, well.

You seem to be a big fan of CCTV cameras, eh?
You aren't, are you?

No, I can see.
It must be annoying, now you're about to enter politics.
But don't worry, Jan. Even like that you'll find idiots who'll vote for you.
Hey.

What?

If you get elected, I'm moving abroad.
I'll gladly pay for your plane tickets.

We have to go to the hospital.

You have to go and apologize.
Jan, we haven't got time for this.
Two minutes.

Hold on a minute.

Didn't you hear?

What was all that?

It's a sad story.

He's not a bad lad but...

Ended up as a prostitute.

Apparently his fault the mother started taking drugs.

Really sad.

Are you OK?
He went to the hospital.

His hand was all grazed.

But he seemed genuinely surprised when I said Philippe had been stabbed so there is something... something I'm overlooking and I don't know what.
I can get a trace put on his mobile phone.

Do you know an examining magistrate who'd give us permission?

Give me an hour.

One hour...

And I can put him in a cell.

I was appointed to do things differently from Verbeek.

Then he'll become a minister.

Minister Jan Verbeek.

We're going to the hospital, eh?

Just apologize and it's done with.
Otherwise it will haunt you until the elections.
OK, quickly then.

What is more important than the elections at this moment in time?
What happened?
Whatever you did, I'll sort it out.

It's all just a bit much at the moment, OK?
You're not stressed, are you?
What will you do during the debates?

Look, Jan. I think you need to learn to control yourself.

Keep your head and show everyone you are a responsible person.
That's it.
OK.

Good morning.

Jan would like to offer his apologies and, above all, clarify what happened during this very unfortunate incident.

What's going on?
Will he also apologize if there are no cameras?
Right.

YES.
My apologies.

I'm not really used to journalists being outside my door so...
It's no excuse but I was tired and I overreacted, so... once again, my heartfelt apologies.

Right.
Right.

Is it already on YouTube?

It will be viewed lots more times there than in all your newspapers together.
Jan?
Jan?
Jan?
Have you seen Jan Verbeek?

Dries?
I haven't got time now, Dries.

Do you trust me?
We've been after Ozgür for years, now you're protecting him.

I asked you if you trust me.

OK, keep those images.

I'll explain later, OK?
Is that Jan?
No.

If I find out you've passed on any information you're out there and then.

OK.
You're a very good cop, Dries.
And loyalty is a great quality but you need to know who to be loyal to.
Come on, we're going to Charleroi.

I want to go to that informer's flat and then to that lab.
I can't come, I...

I need to finish my report.
My name is Axel Bastin.

This is my fucking will.

My name is Axel Bastin and this is my fucking will.
That son of a bitch drove my mother to drugs, it's his fault she took them.
He didn't want her to have me, wanted her to have an abortion.

He drove her to drugs.

My name is Axel Bastin and this is my fucking will.
My mother had no choice.

All she could do was work as a whore.

I shouldn't have been born with withdrawal symptoms.
This son of a bitch wanted otherwise.

You killed her with your dick and heroin.
Bastard.
And I promise you, Dad...

I promise you you won't be killed by a bullet in your head, Dad.
I promise you I have thought of everything.
This is what will kill you.

It has nothing to do with politics or anything.

He killed my mother.

Here on the right.

My name is Axel Bastin, Police Chief Jan Verbeek's son and this is my fucking will.
My name is Axel Bastin, Police Chief Jan Verbeek's son and this is my fucking will.
The great Police Chief Jan Verbeek.

Knowing he's alive drives me crazy, it drives me insane.
Knowing he's breathing makes me sick.
I swear...

My name is Axel Bastin and this is my fucking will.
The only party that says it like it is.
The only party that is fighting for your safety.
The VPV is your party.

Thank you.

Where is Jan?

I thought you were keeping an eye on him.

Look for him.

OK?

And our greatest asset is God knows where.

Mr Hendrickx.

Jan will be there tomorrow.

Absolutely.

OK.
Excuse me, sir.

Hello.

This is him.

No?

Oh, OK.

It's not worth coming tomorrow.
I'm...
I'm looking for my son.
Hold on.
This is him.
He's a drug addict.

Help me.
Please.
Which drugs does he take?

And he lives in Charleroi?

What's his name?

Axel.
Axel.

I know everyone.
It's not far.

Dries.

I've lost him.

Left here.

Shit.

Jan, you're heading straight for us.

Chief?

Everything OK?

I want you to know you can count on me.

Seriously.

My friendship with Jan won't get in the way of us working together.
I want things to go well between us.
If you're going to declare your love for me every day, that's great.

Turn right here and we're there.
That yellow door on the first floor.
Looking for something?

Nothing?

Is this what you're looking for?

No.

We'll just talk to them.

Really, you'll blow it and you'll end up in prison.
Have you ever fired a gun?

Thanks to guys like you playing cowboy.

It'll turn into a bloodbath, I can't allow you to do that.
You're a good guy, don't do anything stupid.
First floor?

Son of a bitch.
You're doing that to me?
I help you and you do that to me?

Manu is crazy, Manu is...
You jerk with a gun.
This guy watches too many films.

You need to calm down.

I'll do the talking.
Put that away.

Nico, it's Manu.
Who?

If it's for money for your street kids, forget it!
No, I haven't come about that.

It's too far to the door, come back tomorrow.
Nico, open the door.

Nico, is there a guy in there with you called Axel?
I'm here with his father.

Let him go and we'll leave you alone.
Go on, open it.
Who's this?

Nico.
Sir.
Is that him or not?

Do we know each other?

Have we met before?

Axel?

Help me.

Axel?
Your father is here for you.

Manu?

Do you know who you brought with you?

Police Chief Jan Verbeek from Antwerp Drugs Brigade.
Don't move.

You did a lot of damage, Police Chief.

Give me that laptop.

You're crazy.
Chief?
Fingerprints and blood.
Axel, come here.

I've got friends who'd gladly turn gay just so they can bugger you.
Lots of them.

Yeah.
Do you really think I came here by myself?
Do you think I'm crazy?

Oh yeah?
Sorry, I just need to...
Cut the comedy.

He thinks we can't watch Flemish TV stations here in Charleroi.
Hello, Jan. Hello, chief.

What?

He just wants to take his son.

Give him his son and he'll go.

Yes, it's full of drugs.

We're at that so-called drugs lab.

Take him and get out of here.

Thanks.

Speak French, you.

Strange.

Speak French.

I want to understand what you say.

Hey, hey, hey, calm down, Jan. I don't understand.
Call Bomb Disposal.

Shut up.

Shut up, I said.

Dries, please.

There's a bomb.
Come on, Dries.

Come on, come on, you're alive, you're alive.

Come on, Dries, answer your phone.
Come on.
I've been trying to call you for ages.

I want to hear your voice.

OK?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Dries.

Leen and Ruud are dead.
Johan is fighting for his life.

Jan?
That bomb was meant for me.

That informer.
Is he with you?
There weren't any drugs, Jan. There was no lab.

We're screwed, Jan.
Who is he?

Doesn't matter.

I'll kill him, Jan. No, it's my responsibility.
I'll kill him, I swear I will.

I just need to pull myself together, then I'll come and help get rid of the body.
Where are you?

OK, I'll come there.
Axel?

Mr Herman Hendrickx, chairman of the VPV, is still here with us.
Mr Hendrickx, what is your reaction to the tragic events of this afternoon?
Nine people, nine people who were very valuable members of our society and who we lost in the fight against crime and terrorism.
It means current policy has failed yet again and a much more repressive approach is urgently required.
The VPV is the only party to offer an appropriate response and the coming elections will enable us to turn these measures into law.
Lost some very good colleagues.

Very good friends with whom he worked very closely for years...
Jan, where are you?
Ruben, I want to make a statement.

You can't.

I want to appear live on the programme.

I've been told we have ex-Police Chief Jan Verbeek on the line.
He wants to talk to us live on air.

Hello.

Good evening.
My condolences, Jan.
Mr Verbeek, apparently you have some important information about this afternoon's tragic events.
Yes.

I know who is responsible for the attack.
You mean the attack in Charleroi?

Yes.

Mr Verbeek, can you still hear us?

Hello.

The bomb was meant for me.

I'm responsible for the attack.
Mr Verbeek?
We seem to have lost him.
We will try to get him back on the line.
Meanwhile, your initial reaction, Mr Hendrickx.
He's my son.
Look.

I don't give a fuck.
I walked out on his mother when she was pregnant.
I don't give a fuck.
He's my son.

Do you know what they call me in my neighbourhood?
Go ahead, what?

I'm listening.

A traitor.

And in the force.

I didn't care about that.

Dries.
I've only got one son.
And you're going to leave him alone.
Dries.
Dries?
Dries?
No, no, no.
Calm down, Dries.
Calm down.

We can talk about it, Dries.
Fuck you.
No, no, no, no.
Thank you.
Can I do anything for you?

Sleep.
You can sleep when you're dead.

We're sort all that out.

And then put your Hugo Boss on.
As a favour to me.

OK.
People are waiting for you.
Salaam alaikum.

Thank you.

Just drink your coffee and go.
People like you aren't welcome in here.

Just drink your coffee and then don't come back in here again.
Have you got a cigarette?
Keep them.
Your speech is all on the teleprompter.

Jan Verbeek is much more than a colleague.

In life you get chances.

Without him I would be on the street or in hospital or in prison.
I would have stolen that camera by now.

He is like a father to me.

Some people say Jan Verbeek...
That's why we do it.

Let me make myself clear.

It's true the Moroccan community is a source of problems.

I'm from the Moroccan community myself.

Jan has my vote.

My dear friends, specially for you here today, the man you have all been waiting for, for your safety, Mr Jan Verbeek.
CRIMINALITY IS STILL ON THE INCREASE IN FLANDERS.
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT I, PERSONALLY, AND ON BEHALF OF THE VPV...
I...
No.
Police Chief Leen Mertens,
Inspector Ruud Van de Walle,
Inspector Johan De...
No.

Dries.
Dries.
Don't.

My dear colleagues, I have come to appeal to your sense of solidarity with the entire population and... with one person in particular.
A great man.
A leader in the fight for the preservation of our democratic rights and obligations.
A friend.

A man, a word.

I have to talk about the Verbeek law that is being voted on today.
About the law that so much has been said and written about, ladies and gentlemen of the press.
The Verbeek law is said to be an attack on our privacy.
The Verbeek law is authoritarian, tyrannical, repressive.

But before you cast your vote, let me ask you something else.
If you think everything is fine in this country, if you think it's normal that citizens and politicians are murdered on our streets by extremists.
If you think the integration system works well, if you think there are no problems with any community, then spit on Jan Verbeek's grave and vote against this law.
Thank you.
