Shane Smith:

The post-Obama gun industry in America.
Man:

Dan Roberts:

Suroosh Alvi:

The fact that I make guns.
- Yeah.

- You do?

Smith:

It's hard to deny that climate change will be financially beneficial for Russia.
Oleg Anisimov:

Russia is lucky.
Yeung:

Refugee:

During the Obama administration, firearms enthusiasts, fearing harsh new gun control laws, began snapping up inventory, sparking the most profitable period in the history of the American gun industry.
Now, a much more gun-friendly president is in the Oval Office.
I will never infringe on the right to keep and bear arms.
Never, ever.
And that has manufacturers exploring new markets and ready to cash in once again.
Alvi:

Today, we've come here to the largest independently-owned gun store in America to learn about the future of the gun industry.
Alvi:

Sure.

Alvi:

Nothing like today.

The history of the gun business has been a lot of boom and bust.
So, looking around, if feels like we're in... in a boom right now.
Probably one of the biggest booms ever.
Alvi:

Hyatt:

Hyatt:

- Alvi:

- They're getting ready.

Alvi:

The most popular gun is the AR-15 type, the military-looking gun.
Bring it inside your shoulder just a little bit.
Alvi:

It's just like going to the golf course.
Some people go for beers.

Yeah.
Alvi:

There are now over 130,000 federal licenses issued to sell firearms in America.
Compare that to the estimated 14,000 McDonald's nationwide, and you have almost 10 times as many potential places to buy a gun as you do a Big Mac.
To accommodate this growth, gun manufacturing has expanded massively.
So, we're at Kel-Tec.

They're also the only gun manufacturer we contacted who's willing to let us film inside.
- Hey.

Good.

- I'm Chad.

Enos:

- This is the front half of our CNC shop.

Enos:

- Alvi:

Alvi:

The fact that I make guns.
- Yeah.

- You do?

He can do this with his eyes closed at this point, right?
Enos:

Every year, the back order seems to get bigger.
Alvi:

What do you attribute this growth in Kel-Tec to?
Enos:

They felt like their rights were gonna be taken away, so they needed to get this, that, and the other before they couldn't get 'em anymore.
Alvi:

How does the gun industry feel about that?
We feel attacked.

A lot of that is perpetuated by the media in the way they cover these... you know, these "mass shootings"
and these terrible things that happen.
Alvi:

Enos:

Alvi:

Obama:

Alvi:

The years 2009 to 2016 have been referred to as the Barack boom.
When five of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in recent American history occurred and gun sales nearly doubled.
It's not even the fact that a particular firearm was used in a shooting.
It's the fact that everyone's scared that the government's gonna ban that particular gun.
Alvi:

Trump:

Alvi:

Without the fear of gun control, the firearms industry is missing its greatest marketing tool ever, so they're having to innovate.
And there's no better way to insure the future security of an industry than appealing to the next generation.
Good finish.

Man:

Cool as ice.
Leia Edmonds:

- border patrol.

I get asked all the time, "Oh my gosh, are you worried when she starts dating?"
And I go...

Man:

Dan:

That's big.
Excellent!
At last year's NRA convention, one of her sponsors advertised appearances at their booth for her.
And I was stunned.

Two hours of just signing autographs.

Alvi:

And just like the "X" Games did for skateboarders, these shooting leagues have transformed their young participants into branding gold for gun businesses.
Edmonds:

Molon Labe custom-built her AR-15s.
Blade Tech provide all of the magazine holders, the gun belts, the different holsters,
Gun For Hire, for the last three years running, has given her a check for $5,000 a year
- to help cover expenses.

In a lot of ways, it's like NASCAR.
The more you contribute, the bigger you get advertised on the jersey.

Alvi:

So, Shyanne, you spoke to the New Jersey senate when you were 10 years old?
- About what?

if they had passed that law.
And what happened?

Alvi:

America's youngest gun lobbyists.
Meredith:

Are we going to see the normalization of... guns in this country on some level?
I believe that the movement of gun control... is... almost on life support.
I think we have a four-year window that, if we do it right, we could actually put a serious, serious... setback on gun control.
Alvi:

This year, two separate bills were introduced before Congress, which would greatly expand the rights of concealed carriers, effectively erasing many gun-free zones within public schools and government lands.
And the firearms industry is already in lockstep with this legislation as they accessorize to meet the needs of the concealed-carry consumer.
Man:

Everything is hidden under the waistband.

I can just snap my wrist and draw.
Woman:

You wouldn't know it, but I'm actually carrying three firearms and a knife.
Man:

I'm ready to roll.
Pepper spray, a fully-weighted 9mm Shield.
Here's a knife, and in here, magazines.
Alvi:

Mohammad Shuayb is a dentist who recently decided to conceal carry even at work.
Are you ready?

Shuayb:

It's a .357, and it'll do its job.
It doesn't even have a safety on it.
- So, all you have to do is pull the trigger?

I will give this back to you now.
Alvi:

When you walk with your wife in the mall, you can see how people look at her, like they just want to come and tear her scarf off, like it's bothering them or something.
Mmm.

Very.

It's like this constant negative rhetoric is infusing them with something.
And you never know who's gonna switch up on you.
That's why I carry it.
Does it make you feel safer, owning the gun?

Having it on you makes you think of the worst-case scenario more.
It's become an environment where nobody is comfortable.
So, we're standing outside the Islamic Society of New Tampa.
This mosque was attacked by an arsonist last week, and hate crimes like this have been on the rise since Trump started campaigning two years ago.
This is the kind of stuff the community deals with.

You know, our work's been growing more important by the day, unfortunately.
I mean, we've had a huge influx of calls for help, especially since Donald Trump started his campaign, targeting the American- Muslim community.
If you take it back to November of 2015,
- Mm-hmm.

Mosques being torched and burned down
Our own...

I do sermons at sometimes, was arsoned over this past weekend.
How has the Muslim community in Florida responded to that?
Unfortunately, many of us were pushed to start considering taking serious measures to arm and protect ourselves.
If somebody's going to come at you, or your family, or your house of worship, with violent intentions, you need to be ready.
Especially...

Are you gonna have to duck for cover and watch your members getting slaughtered?
Or can you whip out your handgun and do what you have to do to keep your community safe?

Yes, and you should.
Alvi:

An upcoming Harvard-Northeastern University study estimates that 400,000 guns are stolen every year, many of which are sold on the black market.
Researchers estimate that these illegal guns get used in as many as eight out of every 10 gun crimes... primarily in poor, urban centers like Chicago, Baltimore, and Detroit.
Thanks.
So, where do these guns actually come from?
Alvi:

Alvi:

Why don't you guys buy guns legally?

Alvi:

Alvi:

But that era has given way to a different belief.
The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.
Alvi:

You know, when people can defend themselves and their families, we're all safer.
Everyone should have a gun that's sane, trained, and have... be able to use it for protection.
Van:

I have a thousand rounds in my closet.
I hold a thousand lives in my closet.
Trump:

It was only a year ago that the COP Paris agreement was ratified with 146 countries committing to limit global warming to less than two degrees Celsius.
Now, it looked like the world was finally coming together to tackle climate change.
But now, with President Trump and his administration of climate-change skeptics and pro-fossil fuel appointees,
America is reversing course.
It is time to exit the Paris accord.
Now, to see that school of thought already in progress, ironically, you have no further to look than Russia, a pro-energy country that sees climate change not as a threat but instead an economic opportunity.
It's not as cold as I thought it would be here.
Toboni:

He told us that with warming temperatures, the city will thrive.
What is Murmansk known for?
Toboni:

But now, that ice is melting, opening up vast, untouched reserves of oil, gas, and minerals.
So, while much of the world fears the catastrophic effects of climate change,
Russia is looking to capitalize on it.
This is the Murmansk port.

We're about to get on this massive cargo ship that's owned by Norilsk Nickel, and we're gonna ride with them along the Northern Sea Route as they transport a bunch of nickel and copper to the next port city, Arkhangelsk.
Norilsk Nickel, a massive shipping and mining conglomerate worth more than $20 billion is just one of the companies betting big on the Northern Sea Route.
Just a few years ago, navigating these waters was extremely difficult, but that's changing now.
The ice is melting away at record rates, shrinking in summer months to about a quarter of its size in just 30 years.
How much has traffic increased on the Northern Sea Route in the last few years?
Toboni:

However, the Northern Sea Route cuts that distance almost in half and can save up to 15 days in travel time.
Toboni:

Norilsk's ability to ship faster and cheaper also means stepping up its core business, mining.
We're going down into Norilsk's nickel mine right now.
We're going more than a kilometer underground.
Toboni:

What's that smell?
Toboni:

Toboni:

This, combined with heavy metal waste that seeps into the ground and the water, has turned Norilsk into one of the most polluted cities on Earth.
And while Norilsk has made efforts to reduce its footprint, just last year, a chemical spill turned one of the local rivers bright red.
And studies have shown that Norilsk's waterways are flush with industrial pollution.
But with business booming, residents here don't seem to mind.
Is it safe to swim here?

Nyet.
Toboni:

Toboni:

We spoke to Nobel-prize winning climatologist
Dr. Oleg Anisimov, who is studying what climate change could mean for the Russian economy.
We see the effects of climate change as negative, catastrophic.
Do you see it that way?
No.

This is not a tragedy.
Certainly, some places will become unlivable.
But on the other hand, there are places that will become more livable.
One should not consider challenge of climate change without connection to the potential benefits.
There are regions in the world where there are no potential benefits, but Russia is not such a region.
The list of gains is, perhaps, advances of the modern agricultural lands to the north, which creates lot of jobs.
We have savings on the heating energy.
The task is to turn these potential benefits into real benefits.
Russia is lucky.
Toboni:

Russia's fossil fuel industry is in the mood to celebrate.
It's National Oil Day in Russia, and we're in Surgut, which is the oil capital of the country, and also one of its fastest-growing cities.
And Gazprom, one of the big oil companies here, is throwing a huge celebration for all of their workers.
Toboni:

Toboni:

A recent Pew study revealed that Russians were the least concerned people on the planet over the threat of global climate change.
And as the population surges in boomtowns like Surgut, developers are cashing in.
Toboni:

Toboni:

Evgeny repeated familiar arguments often used by fossil fuel proponents in the US.
Do you ever hear about climate change on the radio, or on TV, or in the newspaper?
Toboni:

Toboni:

Toboni:

Newswoman:

Newsman:

Toboni:

It seemed like everyone in Russia wanted to focus on the benefits of climate change while ignoring the costs.
And the national narrative is being orchestrated from just one place, the Kremlin.
To get the government's official stance, we spoke to President Putin's top climate change advisor, Alexander Bedritsky.
Russia's pledge in Paris actually allows the country to increase emissions for years to come.

Toboni:

But now, it's once again becoming doctrine in the US as well.
Regarding climate change,
I think the president was fairly straightforward.
We're not spending money on that anymore.
We consider that to be a waste of your money.
A show of hands, those of you who kind of hope
Administrator Pruitt will just sort of make the EPA go away.
As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord.
What do you think America's role is in fighting climate change compared to Russia?
But with all these economic opportunities, it's hard to deny that climate change will be financially beneficial for Russia.
