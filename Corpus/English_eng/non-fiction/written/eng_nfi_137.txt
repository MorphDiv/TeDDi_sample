[punching and grunting]
- Why won't anybody stop him?

Who the fuck do you think you are?
Ramón!
It's me, it's me, it's me!
How are you, Chapo?
What did he do?
I didn't like his haircut.
- Let's go inside, man.

TOÃ'O CHAPO'S GUNMAN
- Why did you want to see me?

Cut it out, Ramón.
Weed, how much?
Blow.
I like my plants better, Chapo.
They're cheaper.
But it won't last.
Sooner or later, it will be legalized.
Whoever controls the marijuana business wins.
Maybe.
But for now, Yankees want blow.
What are you thinking?
Tijuana's the best place to cross the border.
And I'm the best man for the job.
Let's be partners.
You open your territory for me, and I do the crossing.
We all win.
Why do you like to complicate things, fucker?
Meaning?
You know how it is, Chapo, how it will always be.
If we eventually turn to coke, we'll use Amado, not you.
No offense, Chapo, but bosses only deal with bosses.
- Let's go.

- The airport.

I don't care what they said.
We'll cross their territory, and they won't know a thing.
BENJAMÃN AND RAMÃ"N AVENDAÃ'O TIJUANA BOSSES
[Joaquín] I need someone trustworthy to cross Tijuana.
No time like the present.

The Avendaños know nothing about this job.
Joaquín, are you sure?
- If they catch us, they'll kill us.

If someone can do it... it's you.
[Joaquín] Rayo, the small cans are good.
The big cans have the merch.
[sighing] [man] We're fucked.
Those are Avendaño's men.
- What's in there?

Chili.

Park it here.
We have to check the trucks.
Chili.

Show me a can.
Here, boss.
Those cans have different colors.

Well...

Open up.
No, no, wait, boss.
Don't open that one, I'll lose two kilos.
It's double the money.
Come on, you know us.

Please.

Okay?

There you go.
Next time, I'll bring some crackers for the boys, okay?
Please close the doors, I don't want the cans to get dirty.
Okay, off you go.
Thanks, boss.

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA MR. CHETO'S WAREHOUSE
Now you'll see, Don Cheto.
Well done, bud.
Tough blow for the Avendaños.
You say the word, I'll get my hands dirty.
ALEJANDRA'S HOUSE CHAPO'S FIRST WIFE
- Hello.

- [Alejandra] Joaquín.

- Ma'am.

Hello.
- I didn't know you were coming.

- Buy whatever you want.

A little something from the Avendaños.
I don't get you.
Those two are ready.
You have enough money, but you go and do this.
Trying to fuck with the Avendaños.
What are you talking about?
They know nothing about this.
Stop complaining and help me.

You want revenge because they belittled you.
Am I wrong?
- Am I wrong?

About you wanting revenge.

- Belittling you because you're not a boss.

OFFICIAL RESIDENCE MEXICO CITY
- The general will see you soon.

[door opening]
Conrado Higuera Sol.
Secretary for the Labor Party presidency.
GENERAL BLANCO NATIONAL SECURITY CONSULTANT
You come highly recommended.
But even if the Pope told me you were the man for the job,
I'll decide what to do with you.
You were told the position is for internal communication consultant.
- Yes, sir.

Your job would be to be my slave.
Any problems with that?
- No.

I have to choose between you and another man like you.
Both graduated college with honors and all that shit.
Why should I choose you?
Because I want to be president.
And I don't mind starting as an ass-kisser.
CONSTRUCTION BEGINS FOR THE FIRST MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON
Wake him up.
- Boss.

- Boss.

Don Miguel Ãngel.
What?
Don Miguel Ãngel on the phone.
Miguelón.
Read the news.

Okay, give me a minute.
"Construction begins for the first maximum security prison.
The president's first step was to start building the first Mexican maximum security prison..."
"Almoloya's Federal Center for Social Readapatation."
Why the fuck is he building a maximum security prison?
Did something change since this guy came into power?
No.
- Everything's still the same.

- I don't like this one bit.

Boss.
Chapo's looking for you.

I'll call you later, okay?

Be careful with that fucker, Miguel.
After Colombia, he thinks he's a big deal.
- Why did you bring me a present?

And there's more.
15 million for the organization.
Take them inside.
I know how useful you are, Chapo.
Why don't you tell me what you want?
- Make me a boss.

- I've waited a long time for this.

Take the car.
I deserve this, Miguel Ãngel.
Take it before I forget how much money you make me.
GRACIELA'S HOUSE CHAPO'S SECOND WIFE
What happened?
- The boy?

OFFICIAL RESIDENCE MEXICO CITY
Excuse me, Mr. President.
- News from General Blanco?

Everything's ready.

[in English] Congratulations, Mr. President.
Your term could not have started off any better.
DEA CHIEF MEXICO
In my experience at the DEA, the moment these drug lords start believing in their own power is the moment for them and all their allies to fall.
Downtown.
[cheers and applause]
Don Amado, please.
Would you do us the honor of giving a speech?
- Mm, no...

- [tires squeal] - [gunshot]
[Amado] Okay, okay.
To continue with our celebration, we'll make a toast to the lovely couple... [soldier] Don't move!

[Amado] ...who don't know what's awaiting them...
- Cheers!

Or everyone dies.
Disarm them!
- What's going on, Blanco?

Take him.
[soldier] Don't move!
You can't do this to my client.

Uncuff him.
I'm not Amado... but if you had called me, I'd have come.
Not if you knew you wouldn't be allowed to leave again.
There are deals in place.
That's in the past.
Fucking traitors.
That's why the newbie ordered that prison to be built.
He wants to change the rules.
Not just the rules.

Miguel Angel put the meeting together.
So we'll meet with the real bosses this time?
That's what GÃ¼ero said.
I think you made it, pal.
Don't jinx me, asshole.
[GÃ¼ero] Buddy.
How are you, GÃ¼erito?
Your cooperation.
We can't set you free, but you'll have a good time in prison.
[murmuring]
Hello, Mr. Emilio.
- GÃ¼ero.

- Rafael.

Mr. Emilio.
EMILIO QUINTERO PAYÃN BOSS
Good to see you, Joaquín.
RAFAEL AGUILAR GUAJARDO BOSS
What if I refuse?
We'll extradite you to the United States.
[Joaquín] And the Avendaños?
They sent Don Chuy on their behalf.
DON CHUY THE AVENDAÃ'OS' UNCLE
Their uncle.
[Ismael] Hello, everyone.
[Emilio] Ismael.

- How's it going, Emilio?

[Ismael] How are you, Rafael?
- [GÃ¼ero] Ismael.

DON ISMAEL BOSS
- [GÃ¼ero] Well, I'm still here, so...

Beer, son.
[Joaquín] Good morning, Mr. Ismael.
I hope Mrs. Rosaura is feeling better.
She's better, thanks.
- And your family?

My Quino's the same age as your boy.
Always playing soccer.
Same as my Mayelito.
Good to see you, Joaquín.
[Livas] Thank you for coming.
Everyone, please come in.
LIVAS MIGUEL ÃNGEL'S LAWYER
Don Miguel Ãngel sends his regards.
As you know, this meeting has been called on his behalf so we can reorganize the business after his arrest.
But before we start, Miguel Ãngel wants you to meet the person who'll be in charge from now on.
Good morning, everyone.
- What's this?

What's this, Livas?
[Livas] Please, sit.
We'll distribute Miguel Ãngel's territories by mutual agreement with the federal government.
Everyone, calm down.
Don Miguel's orders.
Please, sit.
Division of territories.
Chihuahua and Nuevo Laredo will be managed by Rafael Aguilar Guajardo, who will also control Ciudad Juárez on behalf of Amado.
Sinaloa... to Ismael.
The Avendaños will be in charge of Tijuana.
Nogales and Hermosillo will now be managed by Emilio Quintero Payán.
San Luis Río Colorado goes to Heriberto Palma.
Rafael Chao will control Mexicali.
And Tecate... is now Joaquín Guzmán Loera's...
MEXICAN UNITED STATES who, from this day forward... will be recognized as a boss.
JOAQUÃN GUZMÃN LOERA BOSS
- [Rayo] Congrats, boss.

To Miguel Ãngel, who's in jail, but did a good deed.
He should've made me boss when I asked him to.
Miguel Ãngel is fucked.
But me?
I'm unstoppable now.
Cheers!
Hi, sweetie.
- Bring more ice, okay?

[Alejandra] Quino, be careful, son.
Hold this.
- Do you want one?

[Joaquín] Ale, the tray.
You still mad?
Now you care?

[Graciela] Hello, everyone.
Be careful or she'll get jealous.
Dad!
Son!
Go play with your brother.
Come here.
- I brought this.

There's some meat if the boy's hungry.
Later, when they stop playing.
Need a hand?
Asshole.
[woman] For you.
Hello.
Hello?
Congrats, Chapito.
- Ramón?

Benjamín told me to invite you to Ismael's birthday party.
In Tijuana?
Yeah, it will be a huge party.
Bring a good present, asshole.
I got another job for you, pal.
- It's a party.

You'll go on my behalf, so buy a very nice present.
Tell the Avendaños I'm sorry, I had a family emergency or something, but make it good.
Why can't you make it?
Because we have work to do.
Don't fuck this up.
You wanted to be a boss so bad, and now you won't enjoy it?
You're wrong, GÃ¼ero.
I want to enjoy everything.
But the more power I have, the more I'll enjoy it.
You have to walk before you start running, pal.
Easy does it.
Miguelón is in jail, man.

His men have no leader.
Rayo will go to the party, and we'll recruit Miguel's men before someone else does it.
[saleswoman] If you tell me what you need,
- maybe I can help you.

Easy, easy, everyone!
We just want to talk to your boss.
Boss.
Nobody move!
[grunting]
We just want to talk.
Your boss is in jail, yes or no?
Well, yes.
- And you want to keep working?

It's your choice.
Stay on the losing side and keep working for Miguel Ãngel, or come work for me on the winning side.
I'm sorry, boss, but I can't ditch Miguel Ãngel that easily.
- Are you afraid he'll kill you?

- But you're not afraid I'll kill you?

But I'm more scared of him.
From now on, you work for me.
LIVA'S HOUSE.

Here you go.
All the evidence Mr. Miguel Ãngel spent years gathering.
GOVERNOR OF SINALOA
Bribes to politicians, the army, everyone he bought.
Well, you've got what you were looking for.
- Where are your guards?

We don't want no trouble.
We'll take the evidence and leave.

I don't know what you're talking about.
That your guards are waiting to kill us.
But we aren't leaving alone.
- You're coming with us.

Let's go.
This way.
[man] Hey!
- So we weren't overreacting.

Put the guns down.
- Or your boss dies.

Easy, pal.
[Joaquín] Grab the briefcase.
[cheering and applause]
- Happy birthday, love.

- Happy birthday, Dad.

- Pal.

- This is amazing.

It was the least I could do for you.

Well, look at that.
Rayo López.
You're a sight for sore eyes, sweetie.
- Are you staying here?

But even if I wasn't, with you here, I'd change hotels in no time.
So, want to have a drink?
And you can tell me what you're doing here.
Okay.

Happy birthday, Don Ismael!
Ramón.

Do you remember our boy?
Lobito?
Of course.

Don't be like that, asshole.
- Pay your respects.

- Thanks, boy.

- Excuse me.

What's this?

It's a present for a party I'm going to.
If you want anything, just ask.

- Cut it.

- Where were we?

Tell me about that party.
You'll have to see it to believe me.
But I think that can be arranged, don't you?
Cheers.
[camera shutter clicks]
Whoever did this came for whatever was in there.
General, one of the guards is still alive.
He saw everything.
It was Guzmán Loera, El Chapo.
That asshole Chapo isn't here yet.
GÃ¼ero is late, too.
He can't do this shit.

Slow down with the alcohol, Ramón.
I want a quiet night.
[laughing]
There you go.

Rayo, did you really have to come?
- We should have stayed at the hotel.

- Just a few minutes, and we can go.

Let's go.
What's up?
What's your name?
Armando López, but they call me Rayo.
- I love that song.

You're not on the list.

Then look for my pal's name.

I'm gonna ask you to leave.
- We're not going in?

I told you.

El Chapo.

I said, leave.
- Don't talk to me like that, asshole.

- Wait.

There it is.

[woman] Armando, stop it.
Listen to your woman, asshole.
Don't tell me what to do, fucker.
I'm here on behalf of Chapo Guzmán, move.
[woman] No, no, stop it!
Stop it now!
What are you doing?

I don't give a fuck about that asshole.
- Am I lying?

- [blows landing] - [woman] Stop this now!
- What the fuck?

Ramón!

- [woman] Let him go!

- Ramón, it's me.

I'm here on behalf of Chapo.
Who the fuck does he think he is, sending a cheap drunk?
- Watch it, asshole.

Send this to Chapo.
Ramón!
[firing]
Follow me, please.
For your troubles, Doctor.
They belittle me and then kill my man.
This is the end of the Avendaños, GÃ¼ero.
Sir, Joaquín Guzmán Loera is the killer.

I believe we should kill hm.
Go ahead.
- I think that would be a mistake, sir.

Easy.

With all due respect, Mr. President... the bosses see General Blanco as an imposed leader.
They didn't choose him.
If we kill one of them so soon, the balance we have now could be disrupted.
What's your name?
Conrado Higuera Sol, Mr. President.
Due to his lack of experience, Mr. Sol can't understand that you don't ask the drug lords for their opinion.
You give them orders, and they must follow them.
If they don't, you kill them.
You're both right.
Control that Chapo.
But do it... without violence.
Like Mr. Sol suggested.
Of course, sir.
I'm sorry, General.
It was careless of me.
- It won't happen again, sir.

Because if it does, you'll be dining with maggots.
