[light waltz music]
- Good morning, everyone.

Ugh!

Yeah, get to the point, Greg.
We didn't come here to watch your one-man show.
Okay, I get it.

A long, dark, snowy winter.
But it's almost the weekend, isn't it?
Maybe it'll be sunny.
I can take my kite out.
Okay!

It's gonna snow again this weekend.
Shut up, bitch!
- Oh, my God!

I'm so sorry.

Yeah.

I mean, not yet.
[singsong] Good morning, everyone!
Who wants lemon squares?
Don't take one.
Her lemon squares are always a trap.
Then you should have come to staff karaoke last night.
[tray clattering]
None of you showed up.
[singing in Korean]
♪ Squiggle, squiggle, circle ♪
♪ Line thing that looks like a table ♪
Can I pick the next song?
No!
Where were you guys?
I'm sorry, Carol.

I thought it was a joke.
I mean, because why would I wanna hang out with these people?

I don't think that's funny, Chuck.
I thought we were all friends.
[laughter]
We can't stand each other!
[laughter]
You know the hardest part about earning so much money?
Not knowing if you'll be able to spend it all before you die.
- [shrill psycho-like notes] - [knock on door]
Hi.

Oh, yeah.

I want you to produce it.

Wait... for real?

I have to call my sixth grade English teacher and tell her she was wrong about me.
Mrs. Alfieri?
Oh, she died?
Where's her grave?
Hey, Greg, Greg!
Can I talk to you about something?
I'm not buying any more of your candy bars, Carol.
I know it's a scam, and you're not on a basketball team.
It's about the staff.
I wanna know why people aren't friends around here.
- It's a problem!

It's not just about karaoke.
It's people's bad 'tudes!
It's really affecting the work...

Nobody even showed up for staff photo!
It's not normal, Greg.
I talked to the intern from "Morning Wined Up"
and their staff hangs out all the time.
You want us to be more like "Morning Wined Up"
with Kelly and Mary-Kelly.
Okay, now I like this duvet.
Put it in your cart!
Put it in your cart!
[both laughing]
Mary-Kelly, you are the reason the bank took my house.
Ha ha ha!

I don't have a house.

[both laughing]
I'm just saying if people were friends around here, it would make work better.
There'd be less fighting, less complaining, less graffiti about you in the bathroom.
Carol, leave me alone.
I'm just trying to make it to the weekend.
Okay, here's the rundown.
So I did some more research on the superbug, and...
You know what?

Okay.
What.

You know what?

I'm not gonna stop chewing 'em.
You're sleeping with Chuck.
Wha-ha-ha-ha!

I would never.
My body is a temple, and by that I mean I let a lotta Jewish guys in.
But seriously, though, Chuck asked me to produce a piece because, you know, he thinks I'm doing a good job.
He sees something in me.
Yeah.

- All right...

What are you talking about?
Men have helped women plenty of times.
They, um... in...
Beast helps Belle.
Although, I guess he's a beast, and he did wanna have sex with her.
[sighs theatrically]
Carol.
[thud]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What do you think you're doing?
Getting the gang together like you told me to.
Everybody, please collect your chairs.
This was a fake meeting called by a well-meaning dementoid.
- Great.

Dude, that's my chair.

Yeah, right.

There's nothing wrong with that chair.
- It ain't broke!

Hey, everybody, Gene broke my chair!
- Get him!

I'll buy everyone new chairs.
Come on, chair.
Do you see what I'm dealing with here?
This place is a tinderbox waiting for the smallest spark to explode.
We do not need more time together.
We need to get through the show and go home.
- I...

Stop trying to make this happen, Carol.
Stop!

There's nothing you can do.
Nothing.
Stop walking with a fake limp.
Hey, God, it's Carol.
I just want my coworkers to be friends.
I don't know if your powers extend to other religions, but if they do, please include Gene and the very nice Turban Guy in accounting.
Amen.

Tune in next week for my two-part expose:
"Are shoelaces getting shorter?"
Hey, men have helped women, right?
Like in the history of the world?
What?

But women they didn't wanna have sex with, though?
Ooh, well, like Mr. Miyagi when the Karate Kid was a girl.
But I guess technically she was a kid, so...
You do know I'm currently producing

And that's our show for our local viewers.
Enjoy the light dusting of snow this weekend.
Have fun out there.
- What?

What the hell's going on in here?
We now go to Washington for a special report.
14 dead tonight in the blizzard of the century.
Keep New York in your prayers.
And I guess New Jersey.
Wait, wait... what happened to the light dusting?
Like it says on my tramp stamp...
Weather changes.
In the last hour, it got upgraded to a snowmageddon of the century on steroids.
Why didn't you warn us?
I did!

Of course.

- "Murder at the Spooky Barn"?

If you wanna read it, you're gonna have to pay 12 cents on Amazon like everybody else.
Mm!
- Oh!

Well, it doesn't matter, does it?
Because we made it through the show.
Now we can all just go home and hop in the tub with our cat.
Oh, my God, you gotta cool it with that cat stuff.
Okay.

Hey, you guys.
The Governor of New Jersey is declaring a state of emergency.
All roads are closed.
We're stuck here together.
[whispers] Good God.
We're stuck here together!
Good, God!
[light music]
Yes, sir, I'm so sorry for the mishap.
Everything here is under control.
Yes, I love you too.
Oh, you were talking to your daughter... right.

Okay.

So why don't we have an icebreaker?
Two truths and a lie.
I'll go first.

I had 30 moles removed.
I had my thyroid removed.
I had my uterus removed.
Wait... those are all true.

I have a truth.

- [employees murmur]

Well, you need two more.
Well, I have a truth too.

How 'bout next time you have some urgent weather info, you walk up here and tell us?
- Okay, still Gene's turn.

I once saw you pee lying down.
- No, you didn't.

You do it literally all the time.
Okay, let somebody else go.

I think everyone in here is just doing their absolute best.
Oh!

That was the lie.
[overlapping arguing]
I told you this would happen, Carol!
- You happy now?

And I'm not questioning my faith at all.
No one taught me how to pee the right way, because I didn't have a dad!
Hey, Mr. Pierce, I have...
Um...
I have the... the research for the...
What do you think of my look?
I based it on a Michael Bublé album cover.
Pretty fresh, huh?
Yeah, it's... it's... fine.
I-I don't really know that much about fashion.
I got this at a Halloween store.
It's actually supposed to be Frankenstein's top.
So...
D-do you wanna talk about the story?
Eh.

Hey.
Where have you been?
I was just sexually harassed.
Me too.

No, I mean... you were right.
About Chuck.

I thought he was singling me out because I was good at my job.
Hey... don't let him steal your power.
You are a strong, modern woman.
You need to march right into Chuck's office, grab that jerk by the collar, and kiss him on the lips.
- What?

If you tell Chuck you're not interested, you'll embarrass him.
But if you kiss him and then push him away and be like, "I want this so bad,
"but you're my boss.
We could never be together, Mr. Roker,"
then your problem's solved.
But that doesn't sound very modern or empowered.
It is.

Okay.

I am never kissing Chuck Pierce.
Well, you better think of something, because if Chuck feels rejected, he's not gonna want to work with you.
He won't even be able to look you in the eye.

Okay, you know what, mister?
I am sick of your bad attitude!
All you care about is running this office and following rules and making sure we do a show every day.
That is literally my job description.
You're a grump, and it's trickled down to your whole staff.
Well, I'm sorry, Carol, but when things go wrong around here, it falls on my shoulders and only my shoulders.
You wouldn't understand.

No.
But I've been a mom.
- Oh, God.

[buzzer sound] Ehhhh!
They're wrong!

But that's because I made it that way.
When Katie was in third grade, she used to beg to have ice cream every night for dinner.
Typical fatty.
But it was my job as her mom to say no.
Until one day I said yes, and you know why?
No.

Because I wanted to have ice cream for dinner.
[laughs] Cool twist, huh, Greg?
You do a great job at running this office.
But sometimes...

Maybe I am the problem.
I never have any fun.
And it affects everyone around me.
At work.

My cat won't even let me sleep in bed with her anymore.
You're right.
Maybe Mama does need a break.
