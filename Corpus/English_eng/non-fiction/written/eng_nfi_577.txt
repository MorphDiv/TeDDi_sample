"Islands Part-7 Helpers" Synchronized by srjanapala
We should touch down in just a few minutes.
Whoa.
So, that's what my mom's thoughts look like.
They look good.
I think.
Hold on.
Whoa.
That's her?
She looks nice.
[ Beeping ]
We're here, Finn.
Humans.
There's so many.
[ Chuckles ] Don't worry, you're gonna fit right in.
Hey, listen.
I remember enough about my old life to know that there were some dangerous people here.
So let's stick together, okay?
And let's all try to keep a low profile.
Hey, you, where's Minerva?
You scared me with that costume, citizen.
And does she have any chips or crackers or anything?
I'm getting real tired of picking batteries out of these BMO cakes.
Where's Minerva?
Man, that's a pretty weird question.
Minerva's everywhere.
Additionally, everyone knows that.
Just look around for somebody who needs help, and Minerva will be there helping, obviously.
"Where's Minerva?" [ Chuckles ]
You hear that, man?
Minerva's into helping people, just like you.
She must've gave you her helper genes as DNA up in her womb with your placenta.
DN-what-what?
Mister?
Can I rub the dog's tummy, mister?
He's got a cute yellow tummy.
Shoot, kid, you don't even have to ask.
Just scooch right up and get busy.
[ Gasps ] You're a talking dog!
Teesa, Meeka, Gee-gee, come look!
A talking dog!
Are they gonna help with the tummy rub?
[ Kids giggling ] Finn, look.
Oh, Geez.
I didn't think we would find her do fast.
We can come with you if you'd like.
Nope.
Finn only.
Hello, young man.
Is there anything I can help you with?
[ Breathes deeply ] This is gonna sound weird, but... and I don't mean to put you on the spot.
But, uh... did you... did you lose... a son?
Careful, citizens.
Litter can be unattractive, but dangerous, as well.
Is there anything I can help you with?
This is going a lot different than I pictured it.
Are you telling me none of you has ever seen a talking dog before?
That's crazy.
That's even crazier than the old lady who lives alone on that weather island.
[ Laughter ]
[ Laughs ]
No, but seriously, if you think this is impressive, you should've seen me at the Flea Circus.
I really stole the show.
[ Laughter ]
[ Chuckles ] Nah, but seriously,
Y'all should really meet my friend BMO.
Now's not the time.
Now there's a friend you can really...
[ Laughter ]
Frieda.
Wow, listen, you guys are great.
I got to get going and find my friends, but man, what a great crowd, though, seriously.
One more joke.
[ Cheering ]
That's all I got.
I don't know any more jokes.
Wait, wait.
I can do other stuff besides jokes.
Like, um, oh.
[ Inhales deeply ]
Pbbbbbbbbbt!
Huh?
I'm just a regular dog, see?
[ Pants ] [ Gasps ]
Minerva!
Oh, are you in shock?
Do you need help?
Hey.
Oh, hey, Minerva.
Finn, I found Miner...
Uh, disregard.
You are creating a disturbance.
Please help let us help you help us to sedate you.
I'm not a mutant.
Although, now that you men...
[ Groans ]
And I'm your suhhh...
Son!
You can't get them off.
I tried a lot already.
I love you, but your mom's a hundred robo-clones.
Those things aren't my mom.
Maybe they look like my mom because they did something to her, right?
I'm going to get out of here and I'm going to rescue her, and I'll hug her, and... and...
I've had weirder fights than this.
Where da bones?
Thas muh hand.
[ Whirs ]
[ Gasps ]
[ Both gasp ]
[ Horns honking ]
Uh...
Are you going to buy me a toy?
No.
Well, maybe.
I have to talk to my friend first.
Mm-hmm.
I made a mistake a long time ago.
My friend got hurt.
I don't know if I'm allowed back in her life.
Mm-hmm.
Where are we going, man?
[ Splashing ]
What is this?
Am I dreaming?
Who are you?
It is you.
Oh my gosh, I can't believe you're alive!
Minerva-bot, hug my son.
You're beautiful.
[ Laughs ] My boy, baby Finn!
Oh, you're so big.
Last time I saw you, you were 6.875 kilograms, and now look at you!
Mom...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm babbling.
Yes, darling?
What happened to you?
You've been gone for so long.
When you and Martin disappeared,
I was left fragile as an eggshell.
Martin is a hider.
He left with our baby.
Dr. Gross was resolute.
She immediately activated her most powerful seeker to bring you back.
But years went by.
You and your father were never coming back.
Dark days grew darker.
I went into myself, and while I retreated,
Dr. Gross's work turned strange and dangerous.
Aroo?
Dr. Gross's actions unwittingly led to the release of a terrible virus.
[ Glass shatters ]
It was the most catastrophic event that had happened to our species in 300 years.
We tried to consolidate and quarantine everyone on Founders Island.
The fatality rate in the general population grew to 62%.
But the fatality rate in helpers, those who faced the virus daily, was 100%.
Or nearly.
I was only one helper and in no condition to do my job.
[ Coughs ]
I made my decision.
With my brain-map uploaded to the Web,
I could be hundreds of helpers.
And humanity needed help above all else.
Since that day, I have protected and cared for all my people the best I could.
[ Sniffles ]
But that all doesn't matter anymore.
You're back!
And now you can live here in safety.
Oh, but I can't necessarily...
For the rest of your life.
