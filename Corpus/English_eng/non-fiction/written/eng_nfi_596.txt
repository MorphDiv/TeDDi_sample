Shh, shh.
Okay.
Please help us.
_
_
X-ray technician to four south.
Uh, I wouldn't give Mr. Richards Methotrax, if I were you.
Allergies, Sam.
Thank you.
You try working 30 hours straight.
Yeah, well, I'm not the one who wanted to be a doctor.
You want to go out to dinner tonight?
How about I just come over after dinner?
You always come over after, but there's never any before.
It's Mrs. Clifford.
Let me just have this one time.
Mrs. Clifford.
Oh, hi, Dorothy.
Just once, I'd like the red.
Thank you.
You little trouble-maker.
Give me that.
It looks like you went to war.
It was sort of like a war, actually.
You got everything but your nails.
This is true, this is true.
But I got those nails.
It is a beautiful color, though.
Come on, give me your hands.
Dorothy.
Aunt Em.
_
_
But Stacey, we're looking at a severe weather warning.
Until 11:00 tonight, and, of course, you all remember that awful tornado that swept through...
There's a mix of 50s and 100s in there.
50s are yellow.
Just don't mix 'em up, Aunt Em, please.
I told you to stop doing this.
And I told you to stop lifting with your back
You went to see her, didn't you?
Karen.
It's all right.
She wouldn't have written you if she didn't want you to know her.
I'm sure that's why she moved back here.
Yeah, well, nothing gets better in my truck, but nothing gets worse.
Dorothy, she's your mother.
You're my mother.
And if she really wanted to know me, she would've reached out 20 years ago.
Do you want to know what I wished for?
I wished I was more.
Nothing fancy or nothing to brag about, just...
I don't know, I always imagined that when I'd meet her,
I'd be... more.
That's a fine wish, but wishing doesn't make it so.
What if she's nothing like I imagined?
What if I'm nothing like how she imagined?
Only one way to find out.
Karen!
Ms. Chapman!
Karen?
Karen!
Ms. Chapman?
Oh, no.
Dorothy?
Dorothy...
Dorothy.
No, nobody can come in here.
Dorothy, no police.
Police not good.
You have to run!
Hey, hey!
Hey... hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
No, no, no, no, no, don't shoot!
No, no, don't shoot!
No!
She's...
Aah!
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no, no.
Hello, hello, hello?
Oh, God, what's happening?
Uh, uh!
Uh, uh!
Uh, uh!
Huh!
Uh, uh!
Uh, uh!
Bad dog.
I'm sorry, I don't understand you.
Good dog.
These are the Tribal Free Lands.
You are trespass.
Excuse me, I don't know how I got here.
Please?
You... y-y-you found her.
You know this woman?
Um, there was an accident, and... she...
She stepped in front of me.
You killed her.
This woman!
I tried to help...
Witch.
You killed the Mistress of the Eastern Wood, the Most Merciful and Stern.
I told you, it was an accident.
Only a witch can kill a witch.
Or The Beast Forever.
You are no beast.
And I'm no witch.
Why are you doing this to me?
I am Ojo of the Tribal Free Lands.
You are trespass.
No, no, no, no!
I was gonna go see my mother and I don't know...
I don't know how I got here, but please!
Please just don't put me back in the water.
I don't know anything.
Please!
She has sisters.
In the West and in the North.
And the Wizard of Oz... you will most certainly have to answer to the Wizard of Oz.
What's happening?
A decision has been made.
You are to be exiled from the Tribal Free Lands, never to return.
I will take you to our border.
And then what?
And then you will step over it.
Ugh.
Your toto looks hungry.
My toto?
"Toto" is "dog" in our language.
Medicine..
For my head.
Are you a healer?
I guess.
I like to help people... when they're not trying to drown me.
What is that?
Is that the beast you were talking about?
No.
The Beast Forever drowned this and hundreds like it.
So the beast is a flood?
Beast Forever takes many forms...
Floods that meet the sky, fires that water cannot extinguish, monstrosities that slither and soar.
So how do you stop it?
Who stopped it before?
A wizard... with those.
Eternal Warriors... they formed a wall around Emerald City to keep The Beast Forever from flooding our entire world.
Yeah, definitely not Kansas.
Why do I get the feeling, Isabel, when I stop playing, you're gonna deliver some horrible news?
Something has happened in the East.
Sir.
This drone was over the Tribal Free Lands last night near the Munja'kin village.
Wait.
Slower.
Closer, closer.
But it tore the sky.
And that is the First True Sign.
Now The Beast Forever will rise.
Go East, Eamonn.
Find out who or what fell from the sky.
Make sure it stays fallen.
Don't you want your High Council to examine the First True Sign?
If it's alive, kill it.
If it's dead, bury it.
Whatever it is, it doesn't come back here.
Doesn't come back to Emerald City.
Safest way, around.
Shortest way, through.
Then I vote around.
Around as we can go.
Through.
Ah!
What is this place?
A prison.
Prison of the Abject.
Most secure.
For anyone who violates the Wizard's law against magic.
Who's that?
My wife.
You killed the witch that put them here.
Maybe the only one who can free them.
Mmm...
Mistress of the Western Fields.
Vessel of Truth and Solace.
I did.
Well, you should have sent someone else.
Especially when they're afraid.
There's rumors of magic.
If it were magic, it wouldn't be yours, would it?
The rip in the sky?
No.
No magic here.
I found a new line of work, thanks to you.
So poppy business up, whores exhausted, blood in the sky, and you perambulating around the people with Glinda's girls.
It has begun.
You may know everything there is to know about The Beast Forever.
I'm sure my sister in the North only picks the best and brightest for the Wizard's Council.
Mistress West...
But you were a baby the last time it came.
You wouldn't be so eager to reach that conclusion...
Enough!
How far along are you?
Chaste?
Helps keep them focused on saving the world.
Isn't that Glinda's only rule?
I couldn't do it.
Too much love to be had.
He's the father.
Follow the brick road to the Emerald City.
The Wizard is there.
Tell your apologies to him.
Can this Wizard take me home?
That's all I want, I just...
I just really want to go home.
The Wizard is great and powerful.
He can get you home.
Poppy pollen.
Opium.
Thanks.
Do not thank me.
I voted to have you killed.
Um, Toto?
Help me.
You okay?
I can't feel my arms.
You have a deep wound here.
What happened to you?
I...
How about your name?
What's your name?
No!
I'm just gonna check your head.
I'm a healer.
I think you're too late.
This is probably yours.
It was at your feet.
I'm gonna put it away, okay?
It's getting dark.
We should try and find some food.
Am I coming with you?
I don't know.
Are you?
Wizard's Guard approaching!
The girl is gone.
But the Witch of the East remains.
That looks good.
Could you, um...
I wish I could say I'm not usually this useless, but, um... maybe I am.
You don't look useless.
How do I look?
I actually don't know what I look like.
You're very h...
Very...?
We should name you.
Even the dog has a name.
Uh, well, whatever you want to call me.
No.
No, that's too much responsibility.
Well, I try to avoid responsibility and permanence.
What's the first name that comes to your mind?
Lucas?
Is it terrible?
Why Lucas?
It's the town where I grew up.
Huh.
So Lucas is home?
Mm-hmm.
All right.
Well, Lucas it is.
Dorothy.
Dorothy.
Dorothy.
Hey, you're hurt.
Prison...
Prison of Abject.
I woke with the strangest taste in my mouth.
Aah!
Do you know who I am?
Witch!
S-S-Stern.
Merciful and Stern.
Steel won't help you, swordsman.
Unless you want to open your neck and end your hurt.
That's the merciful part.
Why did you come for me?
I didn't!
Are you one of Glinda's girls?
Did she send you to kill me?
My sister...
My sister with her secrets.
I came through a tornado.
I don't know how, but I did.
In Oz, nothing good ever comes from the sky.
So when something does, we try to send it back in pieces.
Put that down.
Put it down, it's dangerous.
I'll be the judge of that.
I'll be the judge of everything.
Don't!
Or what?
My, my.
So pretty and so stupid.
Only a witch can kill a witch.
What does it do and how does it work?
Let him go and I'll say.
I don't make deals.
You're pointing it the wrong way.
See?
That wasn't so hard, was it?
The Witch of the East is dead.
By whose hand, we don't know.
Sir, this was magic.
Strong enough to kill a cardinal witch.
_
Glinda.
_
No.
There is only one man to blame.
20 years ago...
King Pastoria and the magic realm fought The Beast Forever.
They fought bravely.
And they lost.
If it were not for me,
Emerald City would have fallen like many great cities of Oz.
I will protect you from The Beast Forever, who ravages our land.
I will protect you from the forbidden magic in the woods.
I will protect you because I am the Great and Powerful
Wizard of Oz!
Dorothy.
We should go.
Where does the road lead?
To Emerald City.
To the Wizard of Oz.
And he can help you?
Oh, yeah.
He can move mountains.
And he can probably take me home.
Maybe he can fix my head.
