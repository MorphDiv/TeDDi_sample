I was 12 going on 13 first time I saw a dead human being.
I was also 12 going on 13 the second time I saw a dead human being.
I was 13 going on 14...
Anyway, you get it.

But that's the thing when you grow up in a situation like that.
It makes you closer to the people you're living through it with, your crew.
My boy Sha...
Lover of carbs, destroyer of property.
Ronnie was the athlete of the crew.
T Will was our ladies man.
Ledarius was the wild card.
And Tony...
Tony was the glue, the peacemaker, always wanted everybody to be cool.
In those days you wanted to be in a crew forever.
But then you grow up, you lose touch, and the calls come less and less until one day, you get the call that you never want to hear.
Tony's dead.
What?
That's two double-doubles, two fries, and two Cokes.
A couple more double-doubles.
And... fries, please?
And a couple more shakes.
Chocolate, please.
Not Tony!
Man.

I'm sick of all this violence.
What violence?

They shot him while he was sleeping?
Savages!
No, man, he went to sleep and just didn't wake up.
That can happen?

I sleep... every night, man.
Hell, sometimes, during the day.
Look, his mom said the funeral's Saturday, and we're gonna chip in for some flowers.
So it'll be $7 apiece.
What kind of funeral flowers can...
You know what?

- Really?

That's dope.
I know.
Eating your feelings.
Classic stage one... denial.
This is not the time, son.
Okay, skipping to stage two.

I don't know if you know this, but I'm going for my peer-counseling certification at school.
Of all the people, why would you test me?
I need you to share your pain and sign my grief log.
10 hours of hands-on training, and I can walk into any YMCA in the world and set up shizz-op.
Sports, girls, drugs...
None of this interests you, huh?
Okay, okay.
Death can be hard to understand.
Sorry about your friend Tommy.
- Tony.

That's my bad.
It's why it's called "training."
Note to self... triple-check name of deceased.
Tony's dead.
Tony is the one that's dead.
Dad's friend Tony is gone forever.
Tony... dead Tony.
R.I.P. Tony.
Tony, Tony, Tony.
Whoo, here it is!
Jesus truly is everywhere.
Thank you for making this sweet potato pie for me, Grandma.
- This is gonna kill at the bake sale.

Bake sale?
Wait.

It's a bake sale, not a bake throwaway.
Oh, my God!

Diane!

Come look at Jesus.
Okay, guys, guys.

But I can make you a snack.
Who wants celery?
Is she serious?
Mom, ask that again.
Say it out loud.
Okay, you know I can make things other than celery, right?
I can bake.

I can use a, uh, uh, a pressure cooker.
Point to the toaster.
- The t...

- Th...

Hey, hey.

Mom's a working anesthesiologist.
She doesn't have time to bake snack pies.
Thank you, Zoey.
Or do arts and crafts,
- or iron our clothes adequately...

Or make food that makes people generally happy.
Okay, that's enough, that's enough, that's enough.
No, I honestly think it's cool
- that you don't know how to do anything.

You're not asking the question "Can women have it all?"
You're answering.
- No.

- Really, Zoey?

Okay, fine.
You know what?

Okay?

- Got it.

- Um, Mom?

Can you ask Grandma to make some more pie?
Now, for anyone who's never been to a funeral in the hood, no one does it like we do.
And that's probably a good thing.
Tony Thompson... may your spirit soar high like this dove.
They could at least turn the ceiling fan off.

Oh!

You sure know how to stretch 35 bucks.
Thank you, Sha.
- Andre.

Pops didn't say you were gonna be here.
Oh, your father's a heavy drinker, baby.
- It's in the blood.

- I pray for you, Dre.

Bar's open.
Ah, okay.

Hollywood Dre.
T Will!

You looking clean, boy.

Uh, well, you know, I don't even know.
Gucci?
Uh...

Look, man, it was just a gift.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, how you doing?
- I'm great, man.

Well, not twins twins, but I did have two babies at the same time from two different women.
- That's kind of like twins.

I guess congratulations.
Ha!
Ledarius!
Come on, man.

Aw, you know I look awful.
I wasn't gonna say it.
Hey, man, what's going on?
I can't call it, man, but I do got this new cement business.
I'm killing the hood with it.
I'm doing everything...
Sidewalks, driveways, walkways, which are sidewalks mixed with driveways.
- Did you know that?

You know that new stadium the Rams are building?
Yeah.
- I'm not part of that.

Ronnie!

You didn't want to dress up?
I...

- Yeah, this is new.

And just like that, after too much time away,
I was back with my crew.

Well, on that one, we got to go.
Strong move on them flowers, Dre.
Oh, man.

Guess we'll see you at the next funeral, Dre.
Yeah, let's be honest...
It's probably gonna be somebody from my family.
Or me.
Yeah, it's probably gonna be you, dawg.
You didn't have to say it that fast.
Okay, hey, look.
I don't want to have to wait till the next person's funeral.
Next week...
- let's watch the game at my house.

- Bring it thugh, man.

All right, let's do that.
- That's what we gonna do.

Barbecue going and everything?
Yeah, everything.

- Yo, Dre.

How was the repass?
Oh, man, it was cool.

You...

Uh, what's a "repass"?
Are you kidding me right now?
It's when everybody gets together after the funeral with some food.
- Oh, a wake.

Well, we call it a repass.
You guys just have to put rims on everything, don't you?
You know what?

I went home this weekend.
Ohh.

To the ghetto?
You weren't scared?
I went to a concert once at The Forum and immediately canceled all my credit cards.
Not gonna get to me, because it was beautiful.
And even better because I got to help the family a little.
Oh, you paid for the funeral.

And it's a tax write-off.
Well, not all of it.
- Did you pay for half?

But you are gonna take care of the financial needs of the widow, right?
I bought the flowers.
Good God, Dre.
Flowers are just another thing that will die on them.
I guess I could've did a little more.
You got to step your game up, Dre.
Put your crew on your back.

Said what?

Yep, my turn to bite.

What exactly is a "Kevin Garnett"?
Kevin Garnett was a very successful black basketball player who played for the Boston Celtics.
It's always a basketball player.
Took care of his whole childhood crew.
Called themselves the "O.B.F."...
"Official Block Family."
And in case you're wondering...
They're not accepting no new members.
A Black Celtic?
Charlie, you're right.
I need to start giving back, looking out for my crew, because that's the dream.
I can tell you without question that is not the dream.
You wouldn't understand, because when you're the successful one in your crew...
Wait, wait, wait.

- You're the successful one?

Did the bleachers collapse at your graduation?
Hey, hey, come on.
They collapsed at mine.
- What?

Can't believe it's been 50 years already.
Where does the time go?
Charlie was right.
I did need to step up, put my crew on my back.
And what better place than my house?
Hol-ly-wood!
- Nice place you got.

I mean, the patio's a little uneven, but you knew that.
Uh, I did not.
Maybe you can fix it for me.
Yeah, man, that's the great thing about cement...
You can pretty much pour it on anything.
Damn, Dre.

How much is your rent?
Uh, well, you know, uh, normal house rent.
Hey, man, can you turn on the AC?

You could take your hoodie off, but then we'll see that weird thing on your neck.
Okay, listen.

I mean, what are odds of cancer hitting four people in one family?
Hey, you know what?

She's got nothing else better to do.
Bow!

What happened?

No, no, no.

- I just need you to look at Ronnie's neck.

Baby, please don't embarrass me in front of my friends, okay?
Ronnie doesn't have a doctor and he needs your help.
Oh, and where's the checkbook?
Ledarius, he's gonna cement the patio.
You know what?

I just want to tell Dre how much I love him.
- Oh, I love you, too, baby.

- Right here, right?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'm Kevin Garnett, and they are my O.B.F.
Yo, Dre, this TV is crazy!
It's yours!
N...

Dre, what are you doing?
I'm saving my crew, damn it!
- Are you sure?

Wow!

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Huh?

- Was it?

Bow, you never ride it.
Because I'm pregnant, and it's been raining.
Make up your mind, Bow.
Either you're pregnant or it's raining.
Dre, why are you giving away all of our things?
We can get more things.
I can't get more friends.
They need my help.
Well, if this is so important to you, why have you never done it before?
Because Tony has never died before.
Oh, okay.
- Except for 45 minutes in high school.

That's when we started calling him Zombie T.
- But he's never died and stayed died.

This is a wake-up call, Bow.
I-I'm making up for lost time.
Okay, your heart is in the right place, Dre, but you can't save everybody.
Yeah...
Oh.

Well, hi!

- I don't know.

- I was watching my stories.

This man driving a car with a pink moustache told me I needed to pack my things and get over here.
- He looked like he meant business.

So here I am.
I sent him, Grandma.

Now, come on, Grandma.

But I'm not hungry.
I know, Grandma.
I'll be right back.
Look at her.
Poor thing ain't ate in so long she doesn't even know when she's hungry.
Seriously, Dre?
I had to take her out of that neighborhood, Bow.
She needs me.

I understand that I have your fifth child in my belly, and I have no backup plan.
Mnh, baby.

This is your family.

Thank you, Ma.
- Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.

But I hope you're not giving them money.
- Mnh-mnh.

No receipts 'cause they'll just return it for cash.
They're animals.
Mabel, what are you doing here?
I don't know.
Okay, I think we're good.

So, Grandma's downstairs.
Her sewing machine is in the garage.
Got it.
- Hey, guys.

What are you guys doing?
Nothing.
Just some big-sister, little-sister bonding.
Cut the crap.

- Oh, um, just a paper.

Oh, look at that...
"Help your kids make a costume for carbohydrate day."
Do you need a costume?
No, she just wa...
Quiet!

Diane, do you need a costume?
I need to be a potato.

Why?

Oh, well, why didn't you ask your mommy for help, sweetie?
Don't look at Zoey.

Did you need a costume?
Mommy...
Yes?
Can you please make me a potato costume?
I would love to!
When do you need it by?
Tomorrow morning.
Ooh!

Wow, that's the next morning happening.
I can't order anything online.
You don't need to do it.
No!

I want to do it, okay?
It's no problem.
I've got this.

I'm gonna make you a potato!
Mommy's got this.
I got it.
This is gonna go bad for you.
"Operation Save the Hood" was on...
So many people to save, so little time.
Which is why I stopped to pick up Sha and get breakfast, lunch, and dinner all at once.
Then we got to work... after a short nap.
I got T Will some diapers for his version of twins...
Who were more twins than I thought.
The moms were sisters who were twins.
Then it was Ronnie's turn.
Not only did I get his surprisingly benign tumor removed,
I also got him a vasectomy, 'cause let's be honest, his genes are toxic.
After Ledarius "fixed" my patio,
I realized his cement work might not be five-star.
Whoa!
So I got him a job.
I was like Robin Hood, but I wasn't stealing.
So I guess I was just a hero...
Hero, friend, handsome bastard.
Ooh!

Hi!

Don't you just love the imperfect simpleness of a homemade costume?
I do not.
Oh, come on, honey.

This is what happens when you ask Mommy to help you.
And now, for my encore,
I am gonna help Jack make a Popsicle-stick pueblo.
Ha!

I don't really know.
Something on your mind, something you'd like to talk about?
Look, save it.
I'm not weak like the rest of the family.
- Weak?

I'd say it takes strength to wear one of Mom's costumes to school.
The humiliation alone would break most people.
Not me.

Really?

What did they call you?
Nothing.
What did they call you, Diane?
They called me "Poo-tato"!
Yes, they did.
So, I was hanging out with my crew again, and I knew they appreciated everything I did for them.
So, how are those diapers working out for you?
- Nice, right?

You know, like diapers.
Cool.

Hey, Ronnie.

- Still working out?

What are you asking me, Dre?
Nothing, you know, just making sure I took care of you, 'cause you know that's what I do, right?
Hey, look at that waitress.

She's sexy as hell, right?
Yeah, but you know what else is sexy?
Generosity.
You mean, like, sexual generosity?
That is hella sexy.
No, I mean... generosity like taking care of those you came up with.
- Dre, what's up with you, man?

No, man.

Let's raise 'em up... to a great friend, and the most generous man we've ever known.
Man, come on.
To a guy who's made all our lives better.
To Tony!
Tony!

To Tony?

Mm.
Did Tony buy you diapers, huh?
Or get you a job?

Tony ain't did nothing but die in his sleep.
Whoa.
Damn, Hollywood.
You really on one.
I think it's best if we just walk away.
No, no, no, no, no!

Hey.

- Fine.

Did you put in a solid foundation?
Of course I put in a solid foundation, Ruby.
Pack it up.

You made four squares for your base.
- Yeah.

Mm-hmm.
Oh, God!
Don't you ever lie to me again about a four-square base.
Oh, Lord.
Why do you do this to yourself?
Sweetheart, listen.
As a mom, you just want to prove to your kids that you can do everything.
Mom, remember when Derek broke up with me?
Or when I needed help with my college essay?
- Yeah.

- that really matters in my life?

You don't have to do everything to be everything to us.
Oh, sweetheart.
Thank you.
So, really, please, just stop.
Because, I mean, seriously, if Diane becomes a super villain,
"Poo-tato" is why.
So, I had lost my crew and spit on the grave of a dear friend.
But they forced my hand with their ingratitude, so I turned to help those I knew who would be grateful.
Why am I still here?
'Cause I'm saving you.
Look, you don't ever have to go back to the hood, Grandma.
And I'm this close to selling your house.
Are you crazy?

That's my house.
This is better.
Look, I'll put you Encino.

Plus, they got a Sizzler here.
I'm fine where I am.
My friends are nearby, I know all my channels, and I'm right next to the ATM where my money's at.
Boy, take me home.
Yes, ma'am.
What are you guys doing here?
Came to give you back your stuff.
Where's the back wheel?
You gave it to me like this.
- What?

I'll get you another little back wheel.
How much does it cost?

You gave it to me like this.
Hey, Dre, we don't need your handouts, bro.
Hold up, man.
Y'all making me out to be the bad guy because I'm trying to help better people's lives?
Hold on.

Yeah, man, I got my cement thing,
- and T Will's good with them babies.

I mean, don't get me wrong, he is a bad guy.
- A bad dude.

All right, yes, they were sisters.
Yes, I sexed them against each other, and, yes, I tore a whole family apart.
But what's that say about me?
I'm great at sex.
And he's a good daddy.
Thank you, big homey.
See, look, we're good.

We just want to be your boys, man.
Hey, man, I want to be your boy, too.
But sometimes I feel bad because I'm the one that made it out.
What you're experiencing is called Survivor's Remorse.
Survivor's Remorse?

If you wouldn't mind signing my grief log,
I'd be happy to explain it to...
Junior!

Okay, I get it.
You're lashing out because you're all feeling sad about Tony... dead Tony.
Okay.

I-I-I'm gonna give you guys some time.
I'll leave this right here in case you're ready to sign.
Thank y...
Look, fellas, I'm sorry I've been acting crazy lately.
And I'm gonna try to stop giving you all stuff.
Whoa, whoa.
Y-You mean moving forward, right, like, post-today?
'C-Cause all this is ours.
Yeah, this is more of a symbolic gesture.
Yeah, something to begin the healing process.
You can just... gradually give it to us, you know?
- You don't need to stop...

So fast.
So, I was back with my boys, and it felt good.
Because we were a crew, and that's for life.
And the fact is, tomorrow's not promised to any of us, so you want to spend as much time as you can with the people you care about.
Because you never know who may be gone too soon...
