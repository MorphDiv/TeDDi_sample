You remember your uncles, don't you, j?
We're about to pull a good job here, lifechanging money.
There is a ton of cash on that base.
You use me to do the dirty work.
You call that being a mother?
She's betrayed you over and over, and now she's betraying your family.
Lena, where were you going?
If cath was stepping out on me, she wouldn't leave Lena alone in the house.
She wouldn't do it, not ever!
She's gone for good.
See, my mom... she hated them.
Come on in.
Grab another beer just over here...
Good?
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
Go, go, go!
Ccover it.
Look, you remember when you and pope duct taped this to that shopping cart when we were kids, with the, Roman candles on the side?
Sent it down quarry hill?
Yeah, you got off easy, man.
I went over the cliff in that thing.
I hit the lake like cement.
That's it!
You sure no one got made?
Only thing about the job that went right.
Yeah, thanks to j.
That was quick thinking, baby.
We're all okay, by the way.
You said this thing was solid.
You said it was north of 90 grand.
It was supposed to be.
Then what the hell happened?
Now let's go eat that pie.
We risk our lives for $500.
All she can talk about is pie.
We pitched her a million other jobs.
But no, has to be the brewery.
You don't think we deserve more of an explanation?
One job goes bad, and you're whining like a bunch of spoiled brats!
What about the jobs that raised you all your life?
You're still living off of Pendleton, every one of you.
That was baz, not you.
Why don't you have another drink, smurf?
I wonder how many cocktails she had when she had the brilliant idea for us to hit a brewery.
No deliveries by the northeast gate ever?
Who came up with that great idea?
In the three weeks we scouted the place, not once was it used.
Should've scouted it for four then.
How do you know you have the right safe?
She's trying to pit us against each other 'cause she knows that if we stick together...
Let's just forget it, smurf, okay?
Unless it was something you were planning to do.
Why?
Why are we still letting her run shit?
We should just kick her to the curb, man.
All right, thanks for being such pussies then.
What, 'cause we didn't make empty threats?
Man, you get pissed off, you disappear for a few weeks, and then you come crawling back.
When you're ready to walk, you let us know.
Until then, please, shut up about it.
She doesn't give a shit about any of us.
She just uses us to get what she wants.
I think that she's just upset.
You think you know her better than we do, j?
What she's really capable of?
Guys, that job was a shit show, no question.
But the smart thing to do right now is to take a beat and just cool out.
When she gets back, let's talk to her.
Let's tell her why things have to change.
Calmly, with respect, we make her see she has no choice.
I'll do jobs solo if I have to not to put up with her shit.
We'll talk to smurf later, yeah?
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's just go surf it off, man.
All right, maybe I'll meet you over there.
It's 34 grand.
Look, I just need more time...
Shit, that's a new one.
Please.
I thought I was gonna get some more money today, but I...
You got your coloring in there?
I'll be back in a minute.
Go inside and help mommy.
Go in.
Now, go.
I still get my 10 grand?
You said the brewery paid their illegals with cash.
Now what the hell happened, Teddy?
I was gonna ask you the same.
I said the first Thursday of each month, not Tuesday.
Today's Tuesday.
Janine.
Where you goin'?
And they're tearing it up here on the downhill challenge.
Knee drags as he comes around the curve.
What are you working on?
Just physics.
Splittin' atoms and shit?
Um, no, just some problems on acceleration.
Jesus, not again.
How many times do I have to say the flu?
Where's pope?
No idea.
Said you were gonna get him here, man.
Get your backpack, honey.
Daddy, can we go to the park?
Pope all right?
Think he's out buying a lamp or something.
First a rug, now a lamp.
He's not careful, it won't look like a prison cell anymore.
So, look, earlier, smurf, we got a bit out of line.
Who's to blame shouldn't be the point here.
We gotta talk about changing some things.
Yeah?
Like what?
Well, first...
We want more of a say in what jobs we do.
Well, you brought me Pendleton.
We ran with it.
Yeah, but since then, you've shut down everything else, so...
Well, every other idea you had was crap.
Not to us, you know, but we still had to suck it up.
You know, I think all we're saying is we want to start making family decisions in... in a different way.
I mean, you can't expect us to be...
The boss?
Is that what you've been doing while I was out?
Figuring out how to gang up on me?
Because if I wasn't the boss, I have a feeling the three of you would be in prison right now, or worse.
Emptied out my bank account.
And what about you with that hells angels who thought you'd do better without a tongue?
And you I'm really proud of.
Calling your mommy to come save you from a meat locker where you're tied up to a chair, naked, covered in your own piss.
Smurf, we get it.
No, you don't get it!
'Cause if you got it, you'd all be on your knees, begging for my forgiveness!
It's out of respect we're being honest with you here.
Why should you keep picking all the jobs when we take all the risk?
And then on top of it, you decide the split?
It took me three months to get that lice out of your hair!
Yeah, and not a day goes by you don't throw that in my face!
How long exactly do I have to keep kissing your ass for?
Who do you think's kept this from happening the last two years?
Pope's not even here 'cause he can't stand the sight of you.
And who's defended you like an idiot?
Who's tried to convince your own sons... your own sons...
That you're not the coldhearted bitch you seem to be?
Me, smurf.
Me!
It's a goddamn waste of time.
I'm out.
Let's see how long you all last.
Knowing that look on her face when she realized we were serious was beautiful, man.
I'm gonna remember it the rest of my life.
No more sucking' mommy's dick!
Equal partners at last.
You really think baz and pope are gonna let that happen?
Not if we call bullshit.
No, see, we're just grunts to them, man.
And the only way that's gonna change is if we start doing our own things, start coming up with our own ideas.
Our own ideas, you know, like this yacht thing I've been thinking about.
I'm telling you, really up our game, you know?
You know what else we need to do?
We need to get j involved, not baz.
Say what you want, the kid's got balls.
He's gotta be confused as shit right now.
It's the perfect time to get in his head.
Well, how do we do that?
Well, for starters, we can try being nice to the kid.
Was that before or after you called her a bitch?
Before.
I told you it was pointless.
Well, it didn't help you didn't show up.
Well, trust me, it would've gone much worse if I did.
Unless you were gonna stab her in the face, it's hard to imagine.
Yeah.
Hey, give me two beers, please.
Craig and deran aren't gonna fold?
They're not gonna fold.
We just gotta get a job together quick.
We use him if we need him if he's willing to piss off grandma.
So far he's just kept his mouth shut.
I don't trust him yet, either.
We gotta throw smurf a cut.
I wouldn't give a shit if she did starve.
Pope, it's just smart.
I'm not paying her.
I wish she'd have dropped me and Julia off at a firehouse door the day she had us.
What's going on with you guys?
I just finally see her for what she is.
Just gotta keep her in check.
Sex can't be that good.
What, is she waving her pompoms at you in bed?
So you've just been standing here, not pumping gas?
I can't be fronting you like this all the time.
What, did you forget to pay a bill or something?
Not anymore.
She just canceled this shit.
Shit, that was fast.
Yeah, that's why we need to hit that yacht or something, soon.
Well, I do now.
Have another one.
Don't you have to get Lena?
It's not even late.
Smurf could use a distraction after what happened.
You been seeing Lucy, too?
And what did she say when you told her about cath?
I didn't tell her about cath.
She'd be up here with the uhaul in two minutes.
Are you kidding me?
It's not happening.
Friend's kind of cute on the right, no?
No, no, no.
I'm all out of antibiotics.
You've been staring at me, and I'm awfully shy, so it's... it's a bit weird for me.
Come on.
Get the movie ready, okay?
Damn.
Manny said you'd still look good.
You recognize me?
I'm all grown.
Now what are you doing here, Javi?
I left you 10 messages.
I figured they were from Manny.
He wants to see you, so I'm here to take you.
To the desert?
Yeah.
Let me go put this away.
Come on, I'll give you a beer.
Some big boys to feed.
Look, Manny's not gettin' another cent from me.
It's 5k a month, just like we agreed.
He should know that by now.
He's dying.
He'd be pissed I said it like that.
There it is.
I'm parked down the street.
Come on.
No, no, no.
You don't hop my fence and tell me to get in a car.
He's running out of time.
You get it?
So whatever shit went on between you, you're gonna come say goodbye.
On my own terms.
Yeah.
You're getting in the car.
No, I'm not.
Whose kid is that?
Baz's.
You gonna sing her to sleep?
How you used to sing to me?
And you won't need that gun.
This is your idea of ideas?
No, we're not here to case the place, man.
The owner just died, left his wife holding the bag.
So?
So that's why I need cash.
I'm gonna buy this place.
Take over the lease and run it.
You can't even see the "open" sign.
Can I still live here?
Of course, baby.
You know, they'll come around, and I think...
Yeah, listen, from now on, you do whatever you think is right, okay?
You wanna run some jobs with the boys, that's fine.
But you can't be a spy if you want them to trust you.
Or at least, you can't have them think you're one.
I'm going to bed.
Good night.
Hey, wait, babe.
I got you a credit card.
It's on my account, so there's no limit.
I trust you'll be responsible.
Thank you, smurf.
Get a good night's sleep.
Hey.
I don't want any food.
Just some privacy.
Yo!
Banging on the door.
Okay, I just had an epic fight with my dad.
Yeah.
I've been, um, sleeping.
That "06" position in Guam running the base's sewage treatment plant?
He's actually gonna take it, and he expects us all to move.
Why would you go with your dad to run a shit factory in Guam?
I told him I'm not going.
Well, tell your dad to eat a bag of dicks and that Guam can kiss your ass.
Do you have any Tequila or coke?
I'll take any altered state I can get right now.
I didn't even ask.
You look okay, but did your fever break?
Yeah, but the doctor said I'm contagious.
Seriously.
I don't want to get you sick.
Will do.
You want soup?
Your turn.
Thanks for watching her.
No worries.
It would've been nice.
Okay, you win.
Go pick up your things.
Daddy and I will be out in a minute.
It's real this time, smurf.
I'm not gonna be able to walk it back.
I don't remember asking you to.
Wow. 10.
You know, I haven't needed taken care of since I was 11 years old.
Well, we're gonna do it anyway.
'Cause you always took care of me.
You bet I did.
Grandma, where's tigey?
Let's go see.
Get in the car.
We're gonna go to baz's, plan some stuff out.
No, man, I've got school.
You're too smart already, man.
I think your gpa will survive a day.
Come on, don't you wanna be a part of this?
Me and Craig think you should be.
I never went to school.
I can tell, man.
The fancy wedding on a yacht?
Yeah, we hit it while it's cruising out in the ocean.
Not to mention get away in the middle of the ocean.
Unless one camera and a fat guy is too much security for you.
People from around here go there.
Smurf's not making decisions now, remember?
About ripping off a church?
What kind of shit Karma's that's gonna be?
I think that ship's sailed, man.
Daddy.
And then we can go to the beach?
I say we vote.
Mega church or the yacht.
J can be the swing.
Is... is that not gonna be equal anymore?
Ii mean, if it's okay with your dad.
Let's pick this up later.
J, hang back a minute.
I'll meet you in the car, okay?
Did smurf tell you to come here?
No.
She didn't send you?
You know that fire you set yesterday?
The boys think that was pretty smart.
You know what I think?
I think bringing cops to the scene could've really screwed us.
I think being lookout means you keep looking out.
When I ask you to do something, I just want you to do it.
Next time you're about to get caught,
I'll just stay in the truck, right?
Better get home now, man.
Yeah.
Hey, could you watch him for a sec?
I'm just right over there.
Thanks.
Can't be too safe, right?
Hey.
I was on my way home from solvang.
What the hell is in solvang?
You know, this, that.
You must be feeling lucky today?
Why?
It's not gonna happen.
What?
You're not exactly open about what's going on with you either.
Sso what now?
Am I just supposed to just jump at the chance?
Why not?
Is cath's stuff still at your house?
Some of it is, yeah.
Well, get it out, and then I'll think about it.
You showing up late to baz's, all coked out, while we're trying to work this shit out, man...
It's not a good look.
And you wonder why they treat us like kids!
It's 'cause you give 'em a reason to.
Responsibility!
Okay!
She's making meat loaf. 7:00.
Well, better make sure she takes the first bite.
I did it.
It's good you came, man.
Right.
Hey, kiddo.
Uncle pope bought me ice cream.
Thanks.
We really gonna do this?
Yep.
She says one goddamn thing about anything...
At least everybody still likes the meat loaf?
You trying to rub salt on my wounds?
That it?
I think we all had a pretty tough day yesterday.
Now this is a family, and that's never gonna change.
Not ever.
Come on, cut it out.
Let's do it.
May we all get what we want...
And never what we deserve.
So come on.
Tell me, what have you agreed on?
What's your next plan?
If you want my help, I'm right here.
J, would you like to help me with dessert?
He started screaming again.
I upped the morphine on his drip.
Hey.
See you, Lena.
Good night.
I'll get the rest of the dishes.
Thanks, baby.
Just be careful, man, okay?
