My brother Nate and me were raised by wolves.
I became one, but my brother did not.
And that worried me, because I was his older brother and I had to take care of him.
I had to protect him.
So I would say to him that the only way to get through life is to be violent and unyielding, and I would tell him that with a lacerated face and broken hands just to prove it.
- [Grunting] - [Speaks indistinctly] Here we go.
And he would nod, and he would sew me up and wrap my hands.
[Grunting]
And when I would rant about how life will fuck you and tear you down...
[Scoffs] and steal from you...
[Inhales deeply] he would nod and he would wipe away my tears.
And when he would find me on the floor with my body shot full of dope, because sometimes
I don't believe a fucking word I'm saying, he would not call me a fraud.
He would pick me up and he'd put me into bed and he would say,
"Jay..." [Sighs heavily]
[Sighs]
Nate was kind, he was courageous, he was brave, he was loyal, he was unrelenting.
And he was an absolute savage in this cage.
