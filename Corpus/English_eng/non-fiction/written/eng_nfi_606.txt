Previously on The Fosters...
Mr. Harvey says that Callie broke into his house.
If the DA finds out, you're gonna go to prison.
There was more DNA on the murder weapon.
Watch out!
She's under arrest.
Vehicular assault and a felony hit and run.
I know you killed your grandmother, and we're gonna prove it.
If you help us build a case against your pimp, we're gonna put him behind bars.
There are so many unknowns about traumatic brain injuries.
She isn't pregnant anymore.
I just can't face him and not tell him the truth, so I wrote him this.
You can't read it, can you?
They're trying to turn Anchor Beach into a private school.
Wonder where this money is coming from.
That's Craig Stratos.
Did you hear about Anchor Beach?
Frannie sent me a screen shot from some anonymous Twitter account.
I know you had an abortion, and that you didn't give Jesus a chance to tell you what he really wanted.
Jesus?
Jesus, are you listening to me?
I can't afford to go to private school.
You're pregnant, aren't you?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
You know this might sound crazy, but... we can do this.
We can have this baby together.
I had an abortion.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you talk to me?
I'm adopted, Emma, you know that.
I didn't talk to you, because the baby wasn't yours.
It was Brandon's.
_
_
So, what do we do now?
Well, uh, there's no way a jury is going to see Callie as sympathetic, or innocent after they see this.
And the DA knows it, so they've... offered us a deal.
It's not great.
It's not even good to be honest, but it's the best we're going to get under the circumstances.
How long?
Three years.
We have until tomorrow to let them know.
If you decide to accept the deal, surrender right away, and begin serving your time immediately.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I can't...
Take a deep breath, okay?
It's okay, you're okay.
Hey, we still have time.
They don't need an answer until tomorrow.
Everything is over.
Um, can you... can you please not tell anyone at home?
It's fine that's, uh, this is between us and Mama, alright?
Hi!
You wrote about my...
You wrote about me on Twitter?
I just heard a couple of kids trying to figure out who was pregnant in our class.
Luckily for me, Natalie put on a few pounds this year.
And Jesus will.
No, he won't.
He's never gonna find out about it, because I deleted it.
Don't you think if he saw it, he would have said something?
Some friend you are.
Three years?
Oh my God, this is so unfair.
I know.
I know, love.
Trust me, I'm gonna do everything I can in the next 24 hours
With Craig Stratos?
Yeah.
Do you have any idea who that man really is?
His son tormented my family, and brought a weapon to school, and then tried to blame us for what happened.
And, honestly, even if they aren't, the end result is gonna be great for everyone.
Oh, for everyone?
What about families like mine who can't afford Anchor Beach Academy?
Lana, of course, your kids will go here for free, and you'll be making more money on top of it, and we won't have to worry about all the politics of the school board,
or writing grants.
We'll have better arts, better sports programs.
Lana, this is our chance to be a part of a world-class educational institution.
Okay, first of all, my name is Lena.
And secondly, I will be back to work tomorrow full-time.
Okay, yeah, good, but I'm gonna need you to do your job and help manage this.
Don't come back if you're just gonna stir the pot.
Kids are already threatening a walk-out, and I have a feeling your daughter has a little something to do with it.
You can get on board, be a part of this, benefit from it, or you can step aside.
The vote's tomorrow, so this is happening.
With or without you.
This is the nanny-cam footage from Doug Harvey's house.
He told us that he'd never heard about Martha's murder.
Well, that's clearly not true.
He knows something, I mean, he has to.
Otherwise, why would he lie to us?
Obviously, I cannot look into this.
You got it.
Thank you.
Any word on Russell?
Anything from Diamond's phone?
Uhhh, no, but, uh, she told him that we were talking to her.
Maybe he's laying low.
Oh my God, if he thinks that she's talking to us...
Should we move her?
I mean, look what he did to... to Brandi.
Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?
So, I need your help with something.
We have to keep any protests, any response from the students, we have to keep things calm and under control.
Um, okay, but we have to make sure our voices are heard.
I know, I agree, and we're going to.
There's a board meeting tomorrow night, and I was assured that the students would have a place at the table.
But in the meantime,
Thank you.
There is something else that you should know.
Nick's dad is the one who is behind all of this.
Wait, what?
He's putting up the money.
Come here.
Hey, um... do you wanna go for a walk?
Sure.
I was wrong about Kyle.
Pretty sure he killed that poor woman.
I can't believe I... let myself get so wrapped up in all of this.
It was so stupid.
So... what does that mean for you?
Um...
Well, the lawyer said that if we go to trial, then we should say that, uh, that he manipulated me, and, and... convinced me all this crazy stuff, so...
Do you think that'll work?
Listen, um...
I know you're going through kind of a tough time right now.
You're finally pissed off.
Which you have every right to be.
Just don't...
Just don't be like me.
No, I just mean, um...
Like don't do... all kinds of stupid things.
Just use that, uh, hurt, and anger, and...
Use it for things like fighting for the school, which you're doing, so...
Where do you think I learned that?
From you.
Listen, if you tell anyone I said this,
I'll totally deny it, but... you're my hero, Callie.
I know you.
You came to my house that day.
You and that lady cop.
This is harassment.
You know, now that you mention it, I do seem to remember that.
I also remember you saying that you didn't know anything about Martha Johnson's death.
But I have a picture here... that contradicts that.
Should we be looking at you as a suspect,
No.
I was at her house that day.
I was painting her curb, but I was not the only one there.
Someone else.
Hey.
Hey.
You, uh, you okay?
What happened with the...
Yeah, no, I'm fine, I'm... just a little anxious, that's all.
Uh, what do you wanna play?
How about that "Great Big World" one that we used to do?
Yeah.

What page are you on?
Uh, I'm on page 47.
And if you ask me again in an hour,
I will probably still be on page 47.
Hey!
So, um, there's a board meeting tomorrow at school.
They're gonna be voting on the whole private charter thing.
So a bunch of us are gonna be there and try and save the school.
Yeah, of course.
Is everything okay?
What's going on with you g... guys?
Nothing, just stupid best friend stuff.
So he starts describing this guy he saw at Johnson's house that day.
Now, I'm thinking he's talking about Troy.
Her grandson; who was a suspect but had a very tight alibi.
Okay, but this was four years ago.
So, how do we know this guy is remembering all this correctly, and how do we know this happened on the day of the murder?
Because thanks to a massive case of OCD,
Doug Harvey is meticulous with his bookkeeping.
He has a record of every transaction he made as a curb painter, and it proves that he was painting Martha Johnson's curb the day she was killed, which we verified with the canceled check from her bank.
Right, which is why he's so obsessed with the case.
See, he was afraid someone was gonna pin it on him.
So what about the grandson's alibi?
Okay, his alibi is his boss at the dive shop where he works, who is now his girlfriend, and the ex-husband has confirmed with us that they were having an affair at the time all of this went down.
So you think that she's lying to cover for him?
Look, this is Gray's case.
You guys really need to take this to him.
He suppressed evidence in the initial investigation.
You really think he's gonna want to open it back up?
Listen, I know that you and I have not always seen eye to eye, and of course, this is important because this is my daughter, but if this checks out... it could mean that an innocent boy
is going to a maximum security prison for life.
Why do you think Gray is so intent on seeing Callie put away?
Cause this girl, this teenage girl, keeps uncovering things that he tried to cover up.
Hey, I just need to grab some stuff.
Have you ever gotten someone pregnant?
No.
You haven't?
No.
Why?
I mean, it said stuff that only she would know.
Anyway, one of the posts... said that her best friend didn't tell her that she was pregnant, and Emma is Mariana's best friend, or one of 'em.
Don't worry about it.
Okay.
Hi!
Hey Grandma, it's... it's me.
Um, do you remember the letter... that you read me?
From... from Emma?
Uh, yeah, uh-huh, what about it?
Did you read me all of it?
So was there anything that you didn't tell me?
So what does this mean for Callie?
Oh, it's a bit of a Hail Mary to be honest.
I'm just hoping that I can point enough suspicion at Troy, then her actions will seem justified, so that she can turn down the plea deal, then uh, take our chances in court.
What's up?
Um...
Okay.
Grandma did, and, um...
So Emma doesn't know that you know.
Come here, sit down.
Are you, uh... ?
I mean, obviously, Ana could have had an abortion, and... and... and I wouldn't be here.
So...
I just wish that... that she would have told me.
So are you gonna talk to her about it?
I think...
So you're in a relationship with Troy, right?
Hmm, sorry to hear that.
Can you be more specific?
Because according to your ex-husband, you and Troy started having an affair about five years ago.
Is that correct?
I'm gonna need you to answer me "yes" or "no."
And if we end up proving that you lied, you go to jail.
So I want you to think very carefully before you answer this.
Do you swear that Troy Johnson was at work that day as you stated to the police at the time?
Okay.
I'll be back.
But I don't think we're gonna get anywhere here.
Can't we at least bring Troy in?
Harvey placed him at the scene.
That's plenty of grounds to question him.
What's going on?
We cloned Diamond's phone.
Looks like her pimp is coming to get her.
"Bring Tina."
Tina, what?
Your pimp's running crystal meth?
Yeah, he jacked it off a street dealer.
I just don't understand why he gave it to Diamond to hold on to.
I, uh, I have got to go.
Yeah, it's a good thing that somebody tweeted the rumor, you know?
Yeah, I know, right.
What?
No... no Secrets, or whatever?
Look, I'm not stupid,
I cannot believe that you knew about Emma, and you... you didn't tell me.
You have a freaking TBI.
Y... y... you flipped out when there was a pepperoni on your pizza.
So excuse me for not telling you that your girlfriend was pregnant.
And for the record, I didn't know until a little while ago.
She didn't tell me.
So if you want to be mad at anyone, be mad at Brandon.
Why would I be mad at Brandon?
Just waiting for the last black and whites to get into place.
Once Russell picks up Diamond and the drugs... we'll force him this way, and he'll be trapped.
I'm just glad we're finally gonna get this scumbag locked up.
Nice work, Foster.
I knew you were gonna be good at this.
Come on, Russell, where are you?
Excuse me, guys, thank you.
Over here.
C... can we come in yet?
Isn't the meeting about to start?
Um, yes, we are about to start, but it's a closed meeting.
We were told we could attend, that's why we're all here.
Well, I'm sorry, you were misinformed.
Whew!
Nick doesn't even go to school here anymore.
Whose fault is that?
You know everything that happened with Nick is because of you.
You're the reason, he... he stalked me, and he broke into my house.
You're the reason he could have hurt everyone in this school!
And you're the reason he almost killed himself.
He never had a chance with a father like you.
Hasn't your family done enough damage to Anchor Beach?
I'm not gonna let you take my school.
Thing is... you don't have a say.
What's happening?
Diamond?
Diamond!
Diamond.
This is Officer Adams-Foster.
We're all clear here, Operator, thank you.
Yes, Officer.
Where is Diamond?
What's goin' on?
Christina. "Bring Tina."
I'm so stupid.
She's bringing him a girl.
Any word on the trial?
Yeah, they offered me a deal.
Yeah, not this one.
It's, um, three years in jail.
Yeah, but I'm gonna take it.
I don't believe these two.
Cause it looks like you're running away, and I know y'all are not that dumb!
You know my mom took a really big chance getting you into GU.
He's gonna kill me.
If I don't go back to Russell, he's gonna kill me.
He ghosted the last girl who crossed him, and if I wanna... if I wanna get out of this alive,
I gotta go back to him, and I gotta bring him a girl.
But you said he was gonna get me a record deal.
She's lying to you, Christina.
Now you really are lying!
I can't.
It doesn't concern you!
Yeah.
Oh, please!
I don't have anything to lose.
I mean, I am going to jail tomorrow, so...
Callie.
Okay folks, let's get started.
You said that this would be the open meeting.
The board decided they'd prefer to have this conversation privately.
Thank you all for being here on this very important night to talk about the future of Anchor Beach.
Now, let me bring up the man who has a real vision for how to ensure the future of ABCC.
Craig Stratos.
Anchor Beach... has the potential to be a world-class secondary school, but it's under-funded, and over-extended.
I am willing to raise... and donate... the money needed to make ABCC an elite... first-rate private school, the likes of which San Diego has never seen.
So, you want to remind us where you were on the day of Martha Johnson's murder?
I'm not saying anything until my lawyer shows up.
Okay, that's fine, that's... that's your right.
Uh, so just listen.
Look, you're guilty, we all know it.
Your DNA's on the murder weapon.
Which would be fine... except you gave sworn testimony that you were at work the day she was killed.
Now, we have a witness who was painting your grandmother's curb that day, and can prove it.
Who places you at the scene.
No, I... that's not...
Oh, you mean Vanessa?
Yeah, we brought her in.
Told her about our friend, the curb painter, and... seems like ever since you two broke up, she's much less interested in protecting you.
Seems like all we had to do was tell her that falsifying evidence was a felony, and well...
So...
Well, here's the deal, Troy.
You can draw this out and make this hard on yourself, or... this can be over now.
Now, you got to be tired carrying this around you all this time.
Admit it now, and we'll make sure you don't end up on Death Row.
I was over helping her with yard work.
I used to do that... sometimes.
She told me that she took me out of her will, 'cause she was... tired of me asking for money all the time.
She thought that I needed to stand on my own two feet.
I was...
I was just so mad that she could even say something like that.
I had the axe in my hands.
And she was turning to walk away from me, and I...
I just swung and hit her.
I didn't mean it.
I didn't think that I would actually hit her.
But you did.
Right?
Get in.
Hello?
He confessed.
Yep, to the whole thing.
DA's gonna have a hard time denying Callie was afraid of him now.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, Callie.
My God.
She's with, um, Diamond, and that Russell guy.
She said you should, you know, track her phone and find them.
Oh my God, Callie.
He's gonna pat us down.
Best hide your phone.
An elite learning institution for the elite.
I was a founding member of the Anchor Beach charter.
It was created because a group of us wanted our children, and the children of this community to have access to a quality education.
So why would we go back on that promise?
And make it only available to those families who can afford $30,000 a year.
A good education is not a privilege.
It's a right.
We cannot continue to take away from the poor... to give to the wealthy.
No new auditorium, or improved computer lab... is worth betraying these kids that we serve.
These kids that you know and love.
So please, please... don't throw away all the good work we're doing here.
It would be a terrible, terrible mistake.
Thank you.
Jesus is starting to get suspicious.
I was just with him a little while ago, he didn't say anything.
Hey, did you know about Emma?
What... what about?
Wait, wait, you...
I thought that it was for the best.
Because... because the baby was his.
That's why you didn't want to tell me.
Because the baby was Brandon's.
They're not gonna let us in, so we're not gonna let them out!
Wait, let me, let me.
Jesus!
You know where his has to go.
Well... the motion to dissolve the Anchor Beach charter is carried.
What's going on?
Education is a right!
Not just for the rich and white!
Education is a right!
Not just for the rich and white!
Education is a right!
Not just for the rich and white!
Education is a right!
Not just for the rich and white!
Education is a right!
Not just for the rich and white!
Education is a right!
Good luck explaining to them what you've done.
You damn near got me arrested.
I didn't know, I just...
They... they knew you was coming to get me, and... and they was setting up a sting, and...
I called 911 to let you know!
You're so stupid, you probably told them something, huh?
I swear I didn't say nothing!
You better not have.
I find out you've been talking to the cops?
Is this her?
This is Christina.
Not bad.
Thought you said she was 14.
Um... she's 16.
I'm sorry, Daddy, but she's a good girl.
Right, Christina?
Is that right?
You a good girl?
Yes.
Call me Daddy.
Take Diamond and Cherisa to their room.
I wanna get to know Christina here.
Come on, let's go!
You don't got to push.
I'm going.
I'm glad you're here.
Hey, you know what?
You want a drink?
No, thank you.
Little sip.
There you go!
Not bad, huh?
Have a seat.
Go on, sit down.
So, I hear you're a pretty good singer.
Um...
