We have merged with the Pepsi-Max.
So we have a bus meeting this week.

Why can't you host for once?
I heard you talked to Isak about Mikael.
Oh yeah!

Okay?
We didn't talk about him or anything.
There is a boy I like.
- Muslim?

He is funny and smart.
- Good looking?

Like that guy Yousef.

Why are we talking about Yousef?

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I DON'T BELIEVE IN ALLAH.
SUNDAY 11:45
- No.

Take away those teeth.
Take them away!
- Do you love me?

Meow!
Meow!
You think I don't love you Vilde?

- You have the dick of a lion.

I love you so much that we'll be together for the rest of our lives.
If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it.
Come.
You are so quiet today?
I'm a little tired.
- Shall we go?

- Okay...

- Nice to have coffee with you...

Aren't couples in love just sick gross or what?
Yes.
When are you going to tell me about that stuff with William?
I guess that would be now, I suppose.
I couldn't testify against Nico.
Has the trial been up?
It was up in August.
I took the plane to Oslo and got up and got dressed.
I sat on the streetcar.

Then I walked ten meters and took the streetcar back again.
Then when I got back to London, William asked me how it went.
And I lied and said everything went fine.
You should have told us.

Either way, the letter about the trial being dismissed arrived.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone so disappointed.
But he has to understand that it was difficult for you?
Yes he understood, or he said so.
That it was fine, but...
I could see that he was so hurt.
It was like as if everything with Nico just... came up to the surface again.
After that he started working and working, all the time.
And we hardly talked to each other anymore.
So I felt like he didn't love me anymore.
So...
One day when he was at work...
I just went back home.
What?
Without saying anything?
But you've talked to each other after that?
I've tried writing a mail to him a hundred times, but every time I think about sending it, I think... that perhaps it's better if we just stay apart.
It has just become so ridiculously complicated between us, that perhaps both of us would be better off with someone else.
You...
My God!

I'll just be destroyed.
You are so lucky.
That you don't have to think about all those problems.
Heartbreak and all that.
Maybe I should just convert to Islam as well?
Don't you think Allah would like me?
I think Allah would love you.
I could just get married and...
I could marry that sweet buddy of your brother.
Yousef?

It's almost like they live here.

You.
I have to ask you something.
Do you think Elias has started drinking alcohol?

Hello!
What is it?
I've done some research.
Okay?
I know how you can get over William.
What are you doing on Friday?
What are we going to do now?
You'll have to find out and see.
No, I don't like surprises.
Hi!
Did you see my e-mail?
Yes, but I haven't had the time to answer.
But...

Yes, do you have her mail so I can send the suggestion for contract?
No...
Noora, do you have it?
I think so.

Or just check mine.
- What's your mail then?

- Password?

Huh?
Exper 5.
- Exp...

Exper 5.

How do you write that?

Oh my God!
With X, or C or?
Hang on, my God.

Here.

But!
- What's she called?

- Thanks!

Okay.

Hello, come on!
My God!

Yeah.

- That's why I'm a good friend.

Say it!

Will you come if I tell you what we're doing?
No!

- Okay, we're going to a cafe.

- Which one?

- No, I'm just curious.

But, what are we going to do at the cafe?
Just drink coffee and enjoy ourselves?
Or is something happening?

It's nothing dangerous.

And the rest you'll see.
Oh, have you started rhyming as well?
Yes, that's included!
- I come along. (continues rhyming) No.

- Ok.

How was this thing going again?
We're here for my sake?
Yes, of course we're here for your sake.
Just to check out muslim boys and so?
Aren't you tired of westside boys now?
I think we have to go out, meet new types of people.
Check that...
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

But you said muslim boys only use norwegian girls.
Yeah.

Don't turn around now, but... are those guys looking at us?
How am I going to know that if I can't turn around?
Oh my God.

- Be cool.

- Hello!

Can we sit here?
Yeah!
- Is it ok?

- Hi!

- Noora.

- Sana.

- It was Sana?

- What are you doing then?

- Chai.

- It's fucking good.

You have no idea how good it is.

Yes, it looked really good.
Help yourself.
- Awesome!

- Yeah.

- Good choice.

But what do you do besides drinking tea then?
- What do we do?

- Yeah.

- Cool.

- Oslo?

What are you studying?
[UNKNOWN]
We're taking different subjects.

Individual courses?
Yeah.

- Shopping for courses?

What do you do then?

Yes, they study...
Shopping for courses.

Because the student fund costs, you know.
[UNKNOWN]
- Hello?

Sorry for calling, but I don't know what to do with Elias.
What happened?
He's completely drunk and wants to go home and sleep.
But I don't think that's a good idea.
Where are you?
I can walk you home.
It's ok, you don't have to.
God, there's no problem.

What was Elias exactly drinking?
Vodka.
Bad reaction?
What did you say?
Bad.

Relax.
You gotta relax.
You're so tough.
Pass the ball.
Wow, reaction!

Tough girl, then.
Just give me the ball.

- You got such bad reaction...

Wow.

Why don't you believe in Allah?
You know, Even, that guy we used to hang out with?
I think he is gay.
Because he... he tried to... kiss Mikael.
And Mikael is quite religious.
So he distanced himself completely.
He was shocked.
So what happened was, that Even was going to cure himself by reading the Quran.
He started posting different verses from the Quran about those being gay ending up in hell.
You know that he... tried to kill himself?
So I just feel that Islam, or religion in general, creates a lot of anxiety on people.
Even was sick though.
It had nothing to do with religion.
I don't know.
I personally feel I've taken the best from religion and thrown away the rest.
And what's the best then?
Things like compassion for others.

Do the best for others and not just for yourself.
That's all.
But that's exactly what the rituals in Islam remind you all the time.

By fasting and praying five times a day.
It gives you focus.
And that's because of the fact that... one should always remember what is the most important.
And that is to be a good person.
Don't you think I remember how to be a good person without praying?
Well.
For me,
I stress through the days, with hundreds of thoughts in my head and... and everything can be totally chaos in the daily life, but... but in the moment I start praying, everything becomes completely quiet.
And clear.
Because even if all that chaos is happening in your everyday life, you remember what really matters.
Everything...
Everything it's ok, because everything is on a bigger frame, and has a meaning.
Like...
Do you know for example, that brains of cockroaches, have nine different types of molecules for antibiotics, that are stronger than any penicillin we have today?
Cockroaches?

Where did that come from?
Because!
It's just that...
Every little part of the universe is so complex.
Think about that.
Even the brain of a cockroach has a bigger importance and meaning on earth.
All the way down to the smallest details.
And I...
I just can't believe that all this is a coincidence.
If religion is so good, why does it divide society?
- Are we two?

- Oh, we are cool.

- Okay?

Are you looking into my eyes now?

I'm not really sure...
- I am looking into your eyes.

No...
But...
What was I going to say?
-What should I say?

Goodbye, then.
Goodbye.
