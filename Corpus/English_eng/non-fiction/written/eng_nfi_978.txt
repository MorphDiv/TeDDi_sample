That girl was not a part of this, Julia.
It has to end.
From where I'm sitting, it never should've started.
But here we are.
I need you to stand down Bianchi.
Put out a fire kindled by Matt Wozniak?
Ooh, that's been a while.
Well, if you can't broker a peace, then at least give me a war without collateral damage.
I will do what I can, but I don't have a leash on Bianchi.
