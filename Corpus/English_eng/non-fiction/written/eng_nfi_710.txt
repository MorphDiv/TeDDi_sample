Previously on Queen of the South...
If I'm dead, you take this notebook and you trade it for your life, all right?
What's in it can destroy Epifanio.
Get out of the house, now.
We have to go.
Where do I know you from?
I was Guero's girlfriend.

You have proven you can be relied upon to do what I need.
Come on!
I shot him.
That's not who I am.
That's not who I want to become.
What is this?

We need to figure out what it means.
It's coordinates.
I'm gonna have to go back to Mexico.
Brenda!
They killed her.
The only thing my husband cannot afford is to fight a war.
So while he's distracted, I'm gonna take over.
He'd rather destroy it all before losing it to you.
Guero, who is this?
It's Teresa Mendoza.
We need to negotiate terms.
I don't work for you.
There's an old saying about success.
That it's lonely at the top.
I'm here to tell you that's bullshit.
I run an international drug empire and I have everyone and everything that I need.
Buenas tarde.
On the way up, even your worst enemies can become your best friends.
And your best friends, collateral damage.
And the fivestar hotels I stay in now, they're a hell of a lot better than the filthy bed I slept on as a drug mule.
And couture feels better than flannel.
But if there's one thing I've learned in this business, it's that no se puede tener todo...
You can't have it all.
And if you want to succeed in this business, someday you will have to choose between survival and your heart.
I didn't make these rules.
I was taught them.
You think it would get easier.
And the scary part, it does.
Earlier today, Epifanio Vargas, the newly elected governor of Sinaloa, held a press conference to discuss yesterday's raids by the Mexican military on suspected cartel members.
The seeds of corruption and violence brought on by the Vargas cartel... who for too long, had ruled over this great state through fear... needs to stop.
Now they will know what it is to be afraid.
Epifanio sicced the Federales on my lieutenants like a pack of wild dogs.
He'll take me if he can.
I know a place in Juarez we can lay low.
It's too risky to stay too long here on this side of the border.
We're going back to Dallas.
We'll need papers for Teresa and Pote.
Epifanio controls all the mule routes.
He doesn't control me.
Mayo...
That truck is following us.
It's been behind us since El Limpiador's place.
Lose them.
Now.
If they get too close, take 'em out.
Just pull the trigger.
They're gaining on us.
Let's go, Teresa.
Let's go.
Radar'll pick 'em up as they cross the border.
Not below 2,000 feet.
He stays low enough, we lose him for good.
I hate Mexico.
What is this place?
Someplace Epifanio doesn't know about.
Camila got it on the cheap from a dealer who went to prison.
So this is where we're hiding out?
You didn't think Camila Vargas would lay low in a dump, did you?
Get settled.
We could be here a while.
It's 500k, cash.
Weapons.

It's enough till we're back on our feet.
It wasn't him.
El Limpiador worked for Epifanio.
He must've been watching his place and had us followed.
Epifanio's men wouldn't have let us get away.
There's only one organization I can think of that would like to take us alive.
We've done everything we can to stay off the Feds' radar.
They've got nothing...

Well, you better hope you're right.
We kept you safe from Epifanio.
If it wasn't for us, you'd end up like your boy Chino.
Look, man, I've been giving you people...
Guppies, Guero.
My boss is done with all that.
No, no, we had a deal.

And that was all fine and good until your girlfriend showed up in the belly of the beast.
That's a game changer.
Gimme me something real, Guero.
You mean this shithole motel ain't real enough for you?
Yeah.

How you doing?
This is it, Mister Da'Vila.
This is your moment.
You give me actionable intelligence on the Vargas cartel, or I put you on the mainline in a snitch jacket.
You know how that'll play.
Bad cop again?
Yeah, you really gotta start watching more cop shows, man.
Camila's on the run.
And she's on the run with your girl.
We believe they're in the States.
Where's she hiding?
I don't know.

Last chance.
Where's Camila's safe house?
I flew Camila out here once on business.
I might know a place.
How many have we lost?
All of 'em.
Every last dealer is bailing on us.
We've got no source.

We've got someone on our ass and we don't even know who it is.
I'd like to talk to Camila.
Alone, please.
You're lucky to have such a loyal man.
He's lucky to have me.
Well, whatever he's done for you,
I can do, too.
Every child in Siete Gotas is born with a gun in his hand instead of a rattle.
I have all the muscle I need.
I'm not offering protection.
I'm good with numbers.
I was a money changer when I was 15.
By 16, I ran my own block...
And then you got swept off your feet by Guero and became his morra.
And you spent years worrying about your pedicure and about how good your ass looked in those tight jeans.
Am I wrong?
Nothing wrong with beauty when there's brains beneath it.
What do you want from me?
I want to be part of the business.
I can be useful.
You'll end up in prison.
Or dead, like every other narco in Culiacán.
I know the risks.
I just lost my best friend.
She's dead because of Epifanio.
You've made it.
You're still here.
It took more than 20 years of blood and sweat to build what I have.
What does a girl like you have to offer me?
The book your husband's been after.
You know, these names...
It could be useful.

It's a code for a smuggler's name.
George Megalos.
Yeah.

I've heard his name.
So you know he works on the Texas coast, making smuggling runs to and from South America.
Guero kept track of all the kilos he was flying for him.
Look at this.
You need a new route to bring in product.
Maybe he can help you.
One name?

And my loyalty.
Whatever you need.
Would you die for me?
No, I'll do better.
I'll survive for you.
Which do you prefer?

The red one.
It'll look good with my dress.
Your mother prefers the red, too, like an angry bull.
You'll be at my side at the press conference?
Yes, Papi.

- Ciao, Mija.

Colonel Cortez.
Governador.
You asked for this meeting.
What is it you want?
You raided the cartel members and you shut down their operations.
In the name of the state of Culiacán, I thank you.
Cartel members that betrayed you to work for your wife.
Your orders were impressively selfserving.
It's not often that civic duty and personal ambition are so perfectly aligned.
I'm the Governor of this state.
You are under my command.
Of course, Governor.
Clearly, you are in charge.
And clearly, you don't know better than to bite the hand that feeds you.
What is it that you want?
Since your separation from Camila, your business isn't faring too well.
The loss of your lieutenants laid waste to 37% of your distribution.
With your wife gone, you will need assistance.
Your political power, my military strength.
We will be unstoppable.
We're here to see George Megalos.
No Megalos here.
King George.
Gun in box.
Come on.
Stop.
Give it to me.
Guns and knife in box.
Go.

Whoo!
Royal target practice.
Nothing but the best!
What the hell are y'all wearing?
It's a boat, not a Morrissey concert.
Hey, will someone get this lady a proper King George bikini, please?
- Listen...

Unless you wanna rock one of these.
Aerodynamic as shit.
It'll make you feel alive, Trust.
Hey.

- I'm good, thank you.

'Cause I just got 'em brand new.
They're a bunch of different colors.
They got little...

Camila Vargas sent us.
Camila Vargas?
No.

She sent us to make a deal with you.
Then where's my offering?
Now, Camila Vargas knows you don't approach a king without an offering.
That would be rude.
And being rude to a king, that's just universally unwise.
Unless you're the offering.
You the offering?
Come on now, tell me you're the offering.
That'll be so cool.
What the shit, Bilal?
I'm right in the middle of extorting sex.
God damn, give me a chance.
These little Fuddruckers tried to Captain Phillips me off the coast of Somalia.
Not their best day.
Now I think of 'em like sons.
Who's the captain now, bitches?
They love that.
We don't deal with lunatics.
And I don't deal with polliwogs.
Let's go.
No, no, no, no, no.
See, you leave when the King says so.
Whoa!
Do I have your attention now?
I'm all ears.
We need to ship cocaine up the coast.
You're going to help us.
And why would I do that?
Because it's gonna be dangerous.
A man who puts holes in his own boat isn't in this business for the money.
He's in for the thrill.
Yeah?
Well, how about this, baby girl?
I like the money, too.
Good.

Oy.
A trawler company.
What do I need Camila's boats for?
I got my own.
It's a legit company on paper.
Take the heat off you using your own.
And I'll hook you up with some product.
That's earthy, yet tart.
Midpalate gap, not bad.
Afterburners?
Ooh, ooh, hoo, hoo!
I like your style, Ken Kardashian.
Our supplier's the best in Mexico.
And if I weren't making more money than God selling guns and ganja, I would be all over that.
But truth of the matter is, you know, I don't need your boats.
And I don't need your blow.
The princesses have arrived.
Hi, honey.
Yeah.
Head on down to the chamber.
Bilal, prepare the royal bath.
Excuse me.
Top speed of 30 knots.
20% faster, with a third more cargo space.
Move our product, your margins are higher.
10% more profit with 25% less risk.
You can guarantee those numbers?
Do one run with our trawlers.
No charge.
If we don't deliver, you're out.
Brains, balls, and booty!
If Rico Suave here didn't already have dibs,
I might just make you my queen.
All right.
I accept your offer on one condition.
I need a little favor.
What kind of favor?
Well, I had a falling out with a business associate in Houston.
He owes me some money.
We're not gonna kill for you.
We're not gonna...
No, no, no.

Nothing like that.

I wanna have a conversation with him.
You know, clear the air.
Kinda, Kingtosubject kind of thing.
Only thing is, he's making it difficult by refusing to meet.
So it's a kidnap job.
You call it what you will.
But you want a piece of this sweet ass?
Well, baby girl, now that's my dowry.
- Baby dolls!

The guy George wants is called Rolando Rios.
He's a threetime violent felon.
Those tats on his neck are from the gnarliest gang in Houston.
Southwest Raza.
Yeah, a guy this hard won't go down easy.
No one does.
How would you know?
I've been kidnapped.

I like a man who knows his place.
What do you think of my new home?
Not bad.
I've seen better.
Never one to kiss ass.
Listen, I want you to arrange a meeting between me and my husband.
Tell him you have the book.
And this meeting, is it gonna be a peaceful one?
No marriage is ever truly peaceful.

If you wanna work for me instead of my husband, you'll do as I say.
No questions asked.
Claro.
Muchas gracias.
Pote, where the hell are you?
You say you are with Camila now?
Can you deliver her to me?
All right.
Let's see if Guero's lead on Camila was right.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Looks like they tucked tail and ran.
Stay alert.
Are you sure this is the place?
It's the address George gave us.
It's a church.

A lot of guys who do time are born again.
Jailhouse conversions.
Trust me, they don't stick.
All right, he's alone.

Shh, shh, shh.

George sent you, right?
You don't need to do this.
Man of God?
All right, get in.
Keep an eye on him till we get back to the coast.
Three dead agents.
Jackson, Sanchez, Lee.
Murdered by Camila's gang, breaking Boaz Jimenez out of our safe house.
She'll get word soon...

This place belongs to us.
And now we come for whatever she's got left.
Hey.
My mom was a nurse before I was born.
She used to say, "A bed is only as clean"
as its corners."
We're just gonna mess it up again.
Yeah?

Promise?
She was here.
She survived this place.
But Teresa isn't just alive.
She's running with Camila Vargas.
You know how that story ends.
Teresa was a money changer, man.
That's all she ever did.
Till she met you.
You got a chance to make it right.
Not many people get that.
Help us take down Camila.
Help us pull Teresa out of whatever mess she's gotten herself into.
Hey, man.

No.

And you running out of time, my man.
Yeah.
The DEA?

It isn't enough.
What George is paying you.
It's not worth it.
I'm not who you think I am.
My journey to this moment was... ugly.
I was gulping for air that never came.
You know, graceless.
Until I let go.
But I'm not talking about me right now.
I'm talking about you.
You know nothing about me.
I know that you suffer.
I can see it in your eyes.
You've lost a lot.
But there's still light in you.
There's goodness in your heart.
But there's only so many stones that you can hold.
And this...
Yeah, this'll be a big one.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, you're wrong.
I know because I've done the things that you are doing.
And then more.
And I can tell you that it...

The pain and the sorrow.
It doesn't ever go away.
Because for everything that we do in this life... well, there's a price.
Do you believe in God?
I do.
Then you know that what you're about to do has eternal consequences.
I'm ready to meet my maker.
Because I...
I know where my soul is headed.
Do you?
Hey, come on.
Wait.
He give you his born again, excon bullshit?
We made a deal with King George.
You back out of this job,
Camila won't give you another one.
This is your shot.
All right, let's go.
Camila, yeah, we're all good with King George.
But the DEA just raided our warehouse in Dallas.
How did they find it?

No, we took care of the mules.
Well, there's a leak somewhere.
I can have our guy on the inside look into it, but it's gonna take time.
Tell him we don't have time.
How is Isabela?
Safe.
In our home, as she should be.
You look lovely, as always.
I didn't come here to be flattered.
It's a statement of fact, nothing more.
I'm here to discuss the book.
I know, Pote told me.

You can't steal what's already yours.
Everything I have, I earned.
You turned my lieutenants against me with bribes and threats.
They were grown men.
They made their choices.
There's more foot soldiers where those came from.
You are a fool if you think that trustworthy men are easy to find.
I don't.
Here.

It's now in my possession.
If you insist in coming after me,
I will use it against you.
You are in the wilderness with nothing, and still you refuse to come home.
To play Governor's wife while you run the business I built.
Ashes do not scare me, my love, no matter how many times you try to burn me down.
Well, if you insist on breaking up your family, we should make it official.
Divorce papers?
A peace treaty.
You sign this, you stay out of my business,
I leave you in peace.
You want to end our marriage.
I never asked you to leave.
And I've always loved you.
But if you don't back down on the foolish demands regarding my business you leave me no other options.
You think I don't have business, the nerve to sign this.

Mi amora, you have bigger balls than any man I've ever known.
One thing I never doubted was your nerve.
Divorce or war.
The choice is yours.
Then war it is.
Police are investigating the death of excon turned activist Rolando Rios.
Since being released from federal prison five years prior,
Rios had been serving as Pastor of East Houston's.
Light of Grace Chapel.
Rios's death serving as a rallying point for legalizing marijuana...
The deal with King George went through.
I'm proud of you.
Thank you.
I'm still not certain you're cut out for this kind of work.
What's this?
Passport with a fake name.
And enough money for you to flee.
Epifanio's gonna come after me.
If he finds us together, he's gonna kill us both.
You're free to leave if you choose.
When I was a girl, narcos killed my mother.
I ran from them.
Like I ran from Epifanio when Guero died.
I'll fight till I die.
But I'm not running anymore.
We can defeat Epifanio.

I'm with you.
Good decision, Teresa.
I let Teresa inside.
That doesn't mean she's earned my trust.
She's hiding something.
Find out what it is.
Little late for mercy, don't you think?
It had to be done.

Everything in life has a price.
Brenda was my best friend.
She's never coming back.
It hurts so much.
Isabela?
Where's Isabela?
Fresh off the bone.
Where's my daughter?
And what have you done with my guards?
My men will provide all the security you need.
My men have worked very hard to prepare this special meal for you.
Please, join us.
Did you know Batman came to see me today?
We talked.
Well, Batman did most of the talking.
More like squealed, actually.
Like a pig.
Like a filthy swine.
Sweating and roasting in his own juices.
You tried to have me killed.
But I'm gonna let you live, Epi.
Retain your position in the cartel, right alongside me.
Just like my Conquistador forefathers first offered Moctezuma.
