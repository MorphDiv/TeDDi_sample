[Gun cocks]
Hey!
My gun.

[Grunts]
[Knock on door]
Hi.

I work for Scot-- Scottie.
Yeah, I know.

Right.

Anyway, there was an emergency, and Ms. Hargrave can't make your... appointment.
She asked me to apologize and to bring you breakfast.
[Chuckles] Great.
Um, do all your clients bring you stuff?
Yeah.

Oh, okay.

Well, I should real-- wait.

That's-- thank you, but I should go.
But, uh, did Scottie give you my number?
Yes, she gave it to me.

I mean, you could've called or sent over breakfast.
But here you are.
Come on.

Okay, but-- [Chuckles]
But just breakfast.
[Siren wailing] [Policeradiochatter]
[Siren chirps]
We got a massive gas leak.

She's with me.
Southbound big rig swerved to avoid an accident.
Jumped the rail, did a face-plant, and perforated the base of the tower column around 4h15 A.M.
Driver's stable at New York presbyterian.
Since when does the CIA work traffic duty?
You didn't call me down here for a truck crash, Dan.
And we got two prison guards in ICU.
Guards?
What have you boys gotten yourselves into?
[Power tool whirring] [Chattering]
[Dan] Operation Davenport.
It's an off-book site used by the agency to interrogate enemy combatants.
We had 32, but now five are missing.

Last I checked, black site prisons are illegal on U.S. soil.
Scottie.

What's your part in all this?
Jack's company runs cybersecurity for Davenport.
How do you plan on keeping this quiet?
Well, we're striking the facility now.
Cameras, servers-- all the incident data will be relocated to a level-four command center in queens.
I'm going to need that footage.
You're not cleared for that.
Your job is to focus on the manhunt.
Look, Dan, if you want the prisoners rounded up, call the U.S. marshals.
If you want the mess you created handled covertly, we do this my way.
And I'll need access to everything.
So tell Jack to shut up and listen, or I walk.
So how do you want to handle it?
[Nez] We have five fugitives loose in Manhattan.
Andre Zidane, bombed a French embassy in Algeria.
Brian Mayhew, cyber-hactivist who leaked a cache of top secret U.S. intelligence data.
Jared Rourke, founder of Aryan freedom force, a Montana-based white nationalist movement.
Chechen separatist, Viktor Dudin.
And Alex Kota, a British national.
Part of a cell that killed an American diplomat in Pakistan last month.
Some of the world's deadliest terrorists, and you want us to hunt them down all by ourselves?
Operation Davenport's black ops.
The NYPD, the bureau, and the public don't know about it or the breakout.
If we're going to avoid mass hysteria, we need to keep it that way.
If the goal was to avoid mass hysteria, a friggin' black site shouldn't have been put in Manhattan.
[Scottie] But it was, and now we need to find these men.
I want the cctv feeds from every bridge and tunnel routed through to halcyon.
Nez, get to the scene, see if you can pick up a trail.
Tom, tell homeland we've got a credible threat, and you want NYPD to choke the city's exfil points.
Say the threat is imminent but not specific.

Ah.
I wanna re-up.
That will get you half.
But maybe we can come to an arrangement.
I have a sense you're plugged into law enforcement.
Yeah.

And you might have access to information that could benefit me business-wise-- who the DEA might be targeting, which of my competitors might be hit.
I'm good with the half.
You're sure about this?
It's the official adoption report.
"Christopher, aged four, last name unknown."
Same Christopher who was brought into child services a week after your son went missing.
[Scottie] "Judge approves change in legal status, conferring all parental rights to Frank and Eva Phelps."
Contact information's in the file.
You're a call away from finding your boy.
[Knock on door]
Sorry to interrupt, but there's something you need to see.
It's about the truck.
[Nez] Someoneweldedreinforced steelbarson thefrontend.
Thisisn'tabig rig .

Whoeverlaunchedit  knewexactlywhatwas on theothersideofthat wall .
This wasn't an accident.

Go to the hospital, get to the driver, bring him back here, and lean on him.
It's been five hours, and we're nowhere on the escapees.
He's our best hope of finding them.
Special agent Doug mccarty, and this is officer lynch.
As I'm sure that your doctors told you-- they didn't tell me nothing.
Am I in some kind of trouble?
Well, we're not authorized to release those details at this time, but we do have a credible threat.
"Credible threat"?
What the hell does that mean?
What is going on here?
Homeland security believes you may be a target in an ongoing case.
This about the accident?
I told the police already-- we're moving you to a secure location where we can guarantee your safety until the threat is under control.
What threats?

If you'll just come this way.
Hey!

Hey!

Stop!
[Horn honks, brakes screech]
[Panting]
Our truck driver was born in queens.
No criminal record, nor ties to any known terror groups.
Uh, still no word on the prisoners.
Nothing at the airports or the train stations or the checkpoints.
Well, breaking out of a black site prison requires planning and manpower, and a ton of network support.
Well, it did for me.
Oh.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Whatever you gotta tell yourself.
Rourke and Mayhew operate alone.
They have no networks.
So that leaves Dudin, Zidane, and Kota.
Hmm.

What aren't we seeing?
Ramadi.

And three months ago, intel named Dudin, Zidane, and Kota as key players in the attack.
And now they're loose in a city with 34,000 cops, and none of them can help us 'cause our government threw these guys in a hole and deprived them of their rights.
[Dumont] Hey, I may have a line on one of the fugitives.
Just intercepted a 911 call from an apartment in Chelsea on 31st.
Check this out.

The police are on their way.

[Shouts in foreign language]
And I'm right behind you.
[Men speaking foreign language]
[Speaking foreign language]
[Tom] Hey, back up.

[Shouting in foreign language]
We can help you.

Calm down.
Sixty seconds, boys.

[Grunting]
Thirty seconds.

[Grunting continues]
[Muffled gag]
[Exhales]
Okay, we officially have a problem.
[Knock on door]
[Woman] Pollack.

[Knocking louder] Open the door.
Coming.
[Muffled grunting]
Officers, good afternoon.
We got a call about an intruder.
Intruder.
Yes.

Yeah, but I thought I saw something, and I don't think I did, and I think I'm okay.
I got the door locked now.

The door wasn't locked.
Was it not?
God, I get a little...

Uh-huh.

You wanna tell me what he looked like?
Yeah, he's six foot one, uh, black, uh, very tall, slender built.
You told dispatch he was wearing a prison jumpsuit of some kind.
Yeah, you know, I don't really remember, but I might-- I think at the station would probably be better to-- I'd feel better...
What's going on here?
Excuse me.

I'm the plumber.

But why the police here?
[Laughs] I-- so-- this is the man I saw in my apartment.
Wait.

Hey.

Go ahead.

What's the maximum sentence for fixing a racist man's sink?
Oh, come on.

[All arguing] I'm not a racist.
All right.

Called over here...

It's racist to...

Of course you're racist.

Take it easy.

I've seen your artwork.

Have a good night, fellas.

Oh, taste?

I like all the colors of the rainbow-- black, red, blue...
Okay, what's Tupac middle name?
[Door opens, closes]
[Muffled yelling]
We should deal with that.
[Femalenewscaster] Manhattanremainson lockdown, witha heavypolicepresence throughoutthecity.
Officialsaretight-lipped aboutwhythelockdown wasordered.
The good news is, three of the five prisoners are back in custody.
Bad news is, whoever organized the breakout is still at large.
How can you know that?
Breakout was meticulous.
Those involved would be given food and shelter.
They wouldn't be caught breaking into an apartment looking for tracksuits.
Where are we on the driver?
Still nothing to connect him to the prisoners.
Look again.

Mother's maiden name, distant relatives, distant step-relatives.
Start at the beginning.

[Howard Hargrave] Were you followed?
No.
How many cabs did you take?
She knows.
The private investigator you hired to find me-- she-- she got to him.

Stay focused on Whitehall.
Whitehall.
Has she said anything about Whitehall?
She found the family who adopted me.
I figured out how they're communicating-- the code-- but I can't find any mention of Whitehall.
Are you listening to me?
She's going to meet my adoptive parents.
They'll tell her I survived, show her pictures.
I was with them until I was 14.
She's going to recognize me.
Brian Mayhew.
He's the one who orchestrated the breakout.
What?
Who orchestrated the breakout.
How could you know that?
That black site--
hey, where you been?
Working a source.
He says Mayhew organized the breakout.
[Scoffs] Well, he's well informed.
We found an offshore transaction linking the truck driver to Mayhew.
He was paid to drive through that wall.
Mayhew is behind the whole thing.
The source-- who is he?
Someone who insists on anonymity.
Hope you can respect that.
Of course.
Solomon, I got a job for you.
No.

This is more important.
[Gasps]
Mayhew.

Everything on track?
Uh, just-- uh, see for yourself.
Is that him?
Yeah, that's him.
Time to get to work.
[Keyboard clacking]
[Malenewscaster] Authoritiesnowsay thecitywidelockdown isdueto apossible terroristthreat.
Nodetailsyet onthenatureofthis threat orwhenthelockdown mightbelifted.
Four notorious terrorists escape, and you're asking me to believe Brian Mayhew is the reason why?
Whoever located that black site accessed government intelligence to do it.
That's Mayhew's specialty.
That's why you had him in there.
He founded hacktivism united.
Angry millennials intent on exposing corporate corruption.
What's the latest?
Still at his hotel.
Meeting's in less than three hours.
Okay.

[Nez] Itstartedinnocentlyenough.
Shutting down meat processing plants to protest animal cruelty.
Uh-- leakingembassycables.
Good luck, Brian.
[Scottie] Leakingwasonething, butMayhewdidn'tstopthere.
He infiltrated a top secret NSA mainframe, stole identities of operatives, the schematics of the C-34 ICBM.
[Dan] Okay, assuming you're right, what's Mayhew going to do next?
He could be just looking for his freedom, but something tells me he's got bigger plans.
[Dan] Theotherinmates stillatlarge?
[Scottie] We'retrackingthem, butMayhew'sourpriority.
We'rerunningdowneverylead .
I may know an angry millennial who used to run in those circles.
And we're only learning this now?
We don't talk much.
Haven't gotten along in years.
How long have you known him?

Scumbag's my brother.
Andhemighthaveintel onMayhew.
[Knock on door]
Yes?

I was told you're having trouble getting Internet access.
That was fast.

You're pretty good at this stuff.

[Grunting]
[Car door closes]
[Malenewscaster] Hissourceclaims thethreatlevel hasbeenraised inManhattan.

[Scoffs]
You look like crap.

I'd invite you to stay for lunch, but clearly you've already eaten.
I wouldn't have come if it wasn't important.

My big brother, the corporate shill, marionette who just loves to dance for the man, wants to talk business with me.
The man is the government.

The man is whoever's holding the almighty dollar.
Hacktivist united.
Used to code with those guys?
And you used to be mom's favorite.
Things change.
Mayhew broke out of prison.
I need your help finding him.
He's planning something major.

People do get hurt.
By the police state.
Mayhew fights big brother.
Naturally, I side with him.
Sorry, bro.
No gold star from your boss on this one.
Can't help you.
You know, your dad was right.

[Door opens]
[Door opens] How'd it go?
He won't help.
Not willingly.
What's that?
It's my spin on the pen recorder.
Tells you what number's being dialed from any targeted phone.
I told my brother we're looking for Mayhew.
And if I'm right, he's going to call to send up a warning flag.
Once we have Mayhew's number, it's a short walk to getting his address.
He'd betray you like that?

[Chuckles] [Device twittering]
Come on, Flynn.
Outsmart me one more time.
[Dialing phone]
[Twittering]
[Chuckles]
You sure that's Mayhew's number?
Oh, yeah.
My little brother's nothing if not predictable.
Brian Mayhew, on the ground.
We're clear!
Somebody's been here recently.
All right.

Make sure we grab anyone coming in.
Check out this setup.
He's got multiple cameras up on a hotel room.
Hang on.

He's tapped into the surveillance feeds for the entire hotel.
Hey, that's the Warwick on 39th.
What's that file?
I don't know.

Or someone.

[Beeps]
[Phone rings]
Warwick hotel.

Room 1521.

Yes, we know.

Uh, which hospital?

Bellevue.

Is this a family member, or-- target's name is Adler, but we might be too late.
Mrs. Adler?

Detectives woodbridge and McKay.
If it's okay, we'd like to ask you a few questions about your husband.
We have reason to believe he was attacked.
Attacked?
No.

He had a medical emergency.

We believe that he was targeted.
Have you seen this man before?
No.

The what ceremony?
My husband is one of the seven.
He holds one of the keys to the Internet.
The secret keys.

Max was supposed to be part of the root key signing ceremony.
And now he's not?
No.

Well, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that's not a coincidence.
Exactly...
What part of the Internet do these secret keys control?
All of it.
Seven keys control the Internet?
That can't be possible.
No, they don't control what's on it, just how to secure it.
All domain names have an assigned number.
But who assigns the numbers?

Seven security experts randomly selected by icann-- the Internet corporation for assigned names and numbers.
Max Adler's wife talked about a key ceremony.
Yeah.

But by being at the key ceremony,
Mayhew gets around those precautions?
Oh, he does more than that.
He can route any domain name to him.
You make a wire transfer, he could get it.
A diplomat sends a secure cable-- could go directly to him.
So he's a hacker who's figured out a way around having to hack anything.
You said the new master key is only generated at this special ceremony.
When's the next one?
Today.
That's why Max Adler was in town.
It's this afternoon on west 50th street.
Nez, Tom, get there now.
This ceremony-- walk me through how it works.
They pull out all the stops-- pin codes, smart cards, biometric hand scans.
That is not an easy room to get yourself into.
Steps are divided up amongst a bunch of people to prevent anyone from compromising the process.
And the whole thing's recorded for public transparency to a live stream on their website.

How do we get through to them?

They're in a Faraday cage.
No electronic devices allowed.

Something we're not seeing.
Mayhew found a way in that room.
Maybe he used Adler's ID.
He still can't beat the biometric scans.
Everyone at that ceremony's supposed to be there.
First off, I'd like to thank alternate Jeremy Wallace for making himself available after Max Adler fell ill this morning.
Yes.
Wallace, the alternate.
He's got to be the connection to Mayhew.
We're going to stop this before that master key gets cut.
Tom and Nez are 60 seconds out.
[Brakes screech]
We're on site.

The two guards at the front desk probably won't like you much.
How do you want to play it?
[Man] Okay, let's proceed.
[Nez mutters]
For what it's worth, we're the good guys.
I wish I had time to explain.
No.

Okay?

Get down!

Face the cage.
Give me the key.
[Exclaims]
What the hell was that?
Uh, just turn around!
Turn around?

Dumont, can you override the building's security controls?
Power's down.

Someonemust'vetrippedit ontheinside.
Do you have eyes on Mayhew?
[Nez] Notyet.
That key's worthless.
They'll change it once you leave here.
Who said I was leaving?
[Ax blow lands]
[Ax blows continue]
Brian, we need to go, now.
There's nowhere to go.
[Guns cock] Drop it!
Put it down.
Brian Mayhew?

Jeremy, put your weapon down.

The mission-- this is the mission.
It doesn't involve you getting killed for me.
[Gun clatters]
Brian, don't do anything you're going to regret.
The only thing I regret is the time I spent wasting away in that hole in the ground.
[Beeps]
Slow.
Whatever's on this must be pretty important for you to risk another lifetime in that hole in the ground.
I'm innocent.
The domain names-- which ones did he access?
Only one-- acssecuredb.Org.
That's our unlisted url.
Yours?

Mayhew was trying to steal the NSA backup.
[Malenewscaster] Officialssaythethreat...
The last escaped prisoner was just found trying to stow away on a staten island ferry.
With Mayhew-- that's five.
Call homeland, give them the all clear.
And have my car pulled around.
Wewillupdateyou  whenwehave furtherinformation.
I, uh-

I don't think anything.

I mean, you're Scottie Hargrave.
Exactly.

You'd be amazed how few men that describes.
Of course I know Trevor isn't real.
I'm sure that's not even his real name.
But he's hot, he listens well, and he's easy to talk to.
I, uh-

Can it wait until tomorrow?
I think I found Christopher.
What?
That's incredible.
Well, I'm not sure, and I'm trying not to get my hopes up.
Right.

I mean, preferably with a man who loves me.
But in the absence of that,
Trevor would be great.
So, yes, it can wait till tomorrow.
I just wish it didn't have to.
[Knockondoor]
Mrs. Phelps, I'm Scottie Hargrave.
I'm here to talk about my son.
I understand you adopted him.
You're making a mistake.

Funny how it's always the guys in handcuffs saying that.
I read your bio.

Brian's a patriot, right?

When the NSA abuses its power and spies on innocent Americans,
Brian holds them accountable.
That's why I was in a black site.
I downloaded data from an NSA surveillance program to see if they were targeting Americans.
I got the missile plans by mistake.
By the time I realized what I had, it was too late.
Our job is not to clear your name.
It's to bring you in.
I'm not even supposed to exist anymore.
Do you really think they're going to let you bring me in?
[Engine revs]
What is this?
[Tires screeching]
Nez, get us out of here.
I got eight long guns on this side.
I got three coming this way.
All right, all right-- get out!
Easy.

Okay!

Get out!

Hey, that intel you hacked-- I'm here to get it back.
[Tom] Who do you work for?
We were contracted to bring him in.
I get the intel, or everyone gets a bullet.
Pick.
Brian, run!

[Gun fires]
Jeremy!
[Nez yells]
Move!

You have to understand what a surprise this is after all these years.
Believe me, it's a surprise for me too.
See, I didn't put Christopher up for adoption.
"Christopher."
Uh, I'm sorry.

Ms. Hargrave, uh,
I don't want to be rude, but we were told that when we adopted Jacob-- that his mother was an addict who abandoned him.
And I believe that's a made-up story.
I understand how this might sound, and that it comes out of the blue, and that you have no reason to believe me, but I, uh-

This is the report he gave me.
I brought it so you can see for yourself there's very little chance that the boy you raised is not my son.
He has your eyes.
He does?
I see it now.
Would you like to see a photo?
Oh, yes, please.

Uh, I'm sorry, but...

This, the mark-- how did he get that?
It's a birthmark.

It's been a long time.

Oh, no.

This boy is...
It's not him.
Give me a three-block perimeter.
They're gonna stay away from any cctv cameras.
Who the hell are these guys?
I told you.

Now they want to finish the job.
You gotta tell me right now.

Well, you read my file.
About how I sent an e-mail to a contact in the iranian defense organization from an Internet café here in New York.
Attached were the design specs for the C-34 long-range missile system.
That you supposedly never sent.
I didn't.

But I was there every day.
I think the NSA placed someone there to clone my location and IP address and set me up.
That flash drive has their surveillance backups on it.
If I can go through the café intel for that day,
I can find proof of who else was there.
What makes you think the NSA has info on everyone in that café?
Because that's what they do.
The NSA sucks up data from everywhere.
Going through that flash drive is the only chance that I have.
I got two rounds.
I got three.
We need to call in for backup.
[Mayhew] No, they have ears everywhere.
You make that call, they will know exactly where we are.
That's a chance we gotta take.
[Beeps]
Dumont, we need an extraction.
Warehouse, southeast corner, Vernon boulevard.

You just signed our death warrants.
They'll be on us any second.
I'm counting on it.
Don't fire unless you have to.
And if you do, don't miss.
Send all assets to the warehouse on Vernon.
Breach on my command.
Okay,movein .
Followhiscellsignal.
This one's clear.

Hunter's point station is four blocks away.
We'll never make it that far, not if they're watching.
Stay put.

Cleared them off the street.

[Glass shatters]
Clear on this side.
Where is she?
We can't wait, not here.

[Man] Should be up ahead.

The phone-- it's a diversion.
Drop your weapon.
[Gun fires] [Grunts]
[Nez] Guys, you gotta move.
This is all the footage from December 13th inside the Internet café cyber villa.
The NSA was all over Mayhew.
They were siphoning images from everyone in the place;
phones, laptops, iPads.
[Tom] And these were collected around the time Mayhew's accused of e-mailing Iran specs to the C-34 missile system?
Stop.
Back it up.
[Computer twittering]
Right there, in the corner.
Now hit "play."
Zoom in.
You recognize him?
It's the guy I just shot.
He must've sent the e-mail to Iran.
Mayhew was telling the truth.
The government framed him.
Someone framed Mayhew, but it wasn't the government.
You got Mayhew?
Recognize anybody, Jack?
[Beeps]
Should I?
Fourteen months ago, our firms liaised on a protection detail in Riyadh.
The point man of your company was named Zachary O'Neill, the same man in that photo.
Odd that he stopped for a cappuccino right in the middle of one of the worst acts of espionage in U.S. history.
Do you have any idea how many employees work for my company?
I don't keep tabs on all their whereabouts.
You knew why Mayhew went to that key ceremony.
You knew what he was looking for-- proof of his innocence.
And when you found out that he accessed your url, you sent your hit squad after us to get him back.
Brian Mayhew's a criminal.
Actually, he's a hero.
One who you framed in order to set off a firestorm in the U.S. intelligence community.
Leaving them no choice but to hand a billion-dollar cybersecurity contract to your company.
How much did you make on that deal?
What price did your honor go for?
I don't have to stand here and take this.
You have no proof.
[Cell phone beeps]
[Cell phone ringing]
[Cell phone beeps]
[Quietly] Zachary, stand down.
Stand down.
Well, he can't stand down, because he's dead.
So, what, you think I'm going to apologize now?
Hmm?

I'm the real patriot here.
Mayhew was no patriot.
Let me tell you something.

It'll be a cyber war.
And our power grids and our weapons systems and our nuclear reactors were all vulnerable to cyber attack.
But no one took the threat seriously.
Well, sacrificing Mayhew woke everybody up.
And if that security contract is my reward for keeping this country safer, then so be it.
You're going to prison, Jack.
[Scottie] Give him Mayhew's old cell at the black site.
I hear it's the prime spot for traitors.
[Grunts]
[Handcuffs clack]
[Metaldooropens]
[Man] Brian Mayhew, you're free to go.
If the intel you hacked got out, would national security be compromised?
No, but the spy state would be.
Good.
Thank you.
For everything.
[Cell phone vibrating]
[Malenewscaster] Authoritieshavereopened theLincolnandHollandtunnels andallmajorBridges-- thisafterdhsdetermined thatrumors...

No?

Is there anything I can do?
Do you want to talk about it?
Trevor had a cancellation.
He's better than therapy.
Healsostressed theimportanceof people continuingtogo about theirdailylives.
[Scottie] I knew I shouldn't get my hopes up, but I swore I'd never put myself in that position again.
But...
A boy found so close to where we lost him.
It just...
I'm a very practical person.
I know bad things happen to good people, and I don't believe in miracles...
But i--
I thought for a moment that I might find him.
[Phone beeps]
[Ringing]
What'd you find?
That Tom Keen's being extra careful.
You lost him.

But whatever he's up to, he doesn't want anybody to know.

I don't understand.

Always has, always will.
Howard's told me a lot about you.
You're the one who told Scottie how to contact my adoptive parents.
Which is why Scottie now believes that her son is dead.
Which is what the people that we hired to play Mr. and Mrs. Phelps led her to believe.
[Man] For the moment.
Scottie's resourceful.
She'll figure out the truth in time.
[Howard] I just hope she's confided in you about Whitehall by then.
Whitehall.

She's been exchanging coded messages with someone.
So far, I haven't been able to decrypt them, but they should shed some light on-- on what?

A line item.
I noticed it in the halcyon budget a few years ago.
A warehouse in a remote part of South Africa assigned to a covert project with that name.
I never heard of it, which means that whatever it was, it wasn't an official company op.
A black op in your own organization?
I asked a few questions.

By the time they got there, the warehouse was clean.
They knew we were coming.
[Howard] So I investigated further.
I hired a former intelligence agent-- one of the best-- to find out the truth.
Two weeks later, he calls me, middle of the night.
He says we have to talk.

I believe Scottie ordered him disappeared.
How do you know it was her?
We have our reasons.
For starters, that's when she began her campaign to marginalize me.
Push me out of my own company.
Convince the board that I was unstable and had to be sidelined.
And when that didn't work, she tried to have me killed.
All to keep me from learning the truth about Whitehall.
And you think she's going to tell me?
Why would she do that?
She will.
When she trusts you enough, she will.
And when she does, we're going to blow the lid off whatever it is she's hiding.
