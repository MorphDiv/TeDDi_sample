Got this phenom-kid, you know.
Ohl scouts freaking out over him,
And the woman stuff starts.
Take it off.

Dress wearing...

Agh!
And grandpa?
He caught a bad one, and it killed him.
Am I like him as a cop?
You're intuitive like him.
And you're emotional like him.
You're tough like me.
He's back.

The asshole who sent me riddles.
You sure it's the same guy?
So the gash on the back of his head...
He was wounded,
And then the bruise mid-thorax is circular.
You think he was held underwater?
Means he went in alive.
Jesse had a boyfriend.
They planned on running away together.
The night jesse went missing.
Jesse didn't show, so danny went looking for him.
Saw him in a white truck near the mine at 1:30 am.
Didn't see the driver.
White truck it is then.
There's tire skids on the road up there.
Maybe we can narrow down the size of the truck.
Go.
So how the hell did you find that body?
They're fake.

They fooled dr.

You sent these to the pathologist?
How long have you had them?
I get that you're pissed but there's more.
Jesus christ.
I told you I would find him.
I told you to talk to me about this fucking guy.
Isn't that the first thing I said to you?
So what was he trying to show you.
The shack or jesse?
The shack, but...
I found jesse because I was here so I don't know.
There's scratches on the wall like somebody was tapped.
Sandy driver disappeared before the pageant.
Was she held there?
I just pulled a dead body out of this water.
And you're talking to me about a 20 year old murder?
What if they're connected?
For Jesus sake, annie.
If jesse shepherd was at the church.
Where sandy's body was found without fingernails.
And I am sent fingernails in a doll dressed like mary,
And told to keep quiet or I won't learn the truth.
About either of them.

The shack is just standing there for 20 years?
It's overgrown.
And it's not a part of town people go to anymore.

Well, then, show me.

If you go, he'll know I told you.
Well, then he's gonna know when I got 50 fucking cops after him.
I have to deal with this on my own.
You're out of your mind, you know that?
We have a dead kid and he knows something.
And if he vanishes then... annie.
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?
You can't do this alone.

If sandy driver was held in that shack 20 years ago,
We didn't know that, annie.
So tell me that you understand.
That you may be talking to a killer right now.
Or maybe somebody who knows things.
Who has odd communication skills.
So what's your plan?
I used to leave him things.
In exchange for the riddles.
"What I found beyond the horizon."
Hard night?
I just dropped maggie off.
After she id'd the body of her son.
She...
I'm sensitive.
Tell your friends.
Jesse would have had to have called someone.
After the fight in the scrap yard.
Couldn't.

We should check payphones.
Within a walking distance of the gas station.
Dmv says...
There's 482 white trucks in bellevue, rez,
And surrounding area.

I guess we start with a.
Okay, so...
Coroner says jesse was killed the night he went missing.
Blunt force head trauma.
Jagged lacerations,
From either a piece of metal or rock,
But the official cause is drowning.
Dna?
No.

He was killed near the entrance to the lake.
It appears his body drifted a bit.
Rock to the head is heat of the moment.
Whoever picked him up didn't do so intending to kill.
Something happened in the truck.
Take danny debassage out to where he saw the truck.
And get him to talk you through it.
I don't know, jog his memory.

Okay.
Gather around, guys!
Sorry.
I'm making a tribute video.
Highlights from practice tapes.
Jim, send these to me.

Jesse!
I'm so sorry, maggie.
You need god's strength.
I never did believe in him.
'Til cops came to my house at 5 am.
Now I do.
And I know what he's all about.
Punishment.
Is that something you believe in?
So no idea who?
You wanna show me how they got in.
Thank you, father.
So what's it trying to say?
Joseph.

Betrayal?

Was jesse's father violent?
Jesse's dad's dead.
These things aren't straightforward.
"Sandy found dead after disappearing.
From a christmas pageant dress rehearsal."
Sandy's spirit, hear my call.
Your help I need most of all.
Cross from the dead to the living.
Of this disturbance be forgiving.
Agh!
There's no point in coming back to life.
We'll just kill you again.
Do you hear me?

His number?
He'd be anywhere for a minute and have carved it.
Or written it.
It used to piss me off.
Jesse get along with his father while he was alive?
Was there any violence between them?
His dad liked to go to the bar after jesse's games.
For attention.
That was about the extent of their relationship.
Mind if I take a look at this?
Why are you asking about his dad?
'Cause of the girl thing?
Lack of male influence?
I could have gotten married again.
But I didn't think he needed another asshole in his life.
'Cause he had tom for all that stuff.
I don't know what we would have done without him.
Is that tom's truck?
Show 'em how it's done, jesse.
All right!

Let's see what you got.

See how easy that was.

Jacob, I hear your favorite band the jonas brothers.
Are getting back together.
Ya wanna go with me?
You're dead.

Jacob!

Come on.

Skate!

Hey, jackie.

My husband forgot to eat this morning.
I thought those two were suspended, jacob and max.
It's just a practice.
Strange that they're practicing today.
Tom is crushed.
He he spent more energy on jesse than the girls.
He copes by being with his team.
You know, jesse's team.
The girls are in the car.

Come on!

Jesus christ.

No star to hide behind now.
Come on.

Asshole!
Hey, hey!

Ryder.
I thought I had the room.
You need better lighting.
No wonder no girls play hockey.
They do.

You're right.
I look a hundred.
I can't believe I go out in public.
Yeah, well...
I wasn't supposed to get old.
You weren't supposed to leave the house like that.
And jesse...
Jesse wasn't supposed to be found dead.
You two were really close, right?
I wanted to shake him, you know.
Look what the world's offering.
This is hockey not hollywood.
Put on the make-up in 15 years, and I'll...
I'll be the first to say, hey kid,
You look dynamite in a tube top.
Must have been hard to watch him throw it all away.
Yeah.

Tom, I gotta ask,
Were you home the night he went missing?
Yeah.
Was jackie there?
Listen.

But find the asshole who did this.
I can't believe you told on me.
I thought you were cool, uncle peter.
Yeah?
Well, I thought you were sensible, pipsqueak ryder.
I hate it when you call me that.
Yeah.

Choose your own nickname.

Hello.

So the little criminal decided to break into the driver house.
And conjure up dead sandy.
And mr.

Why would you do that?
In case she could help find jesse.
Why are you bleeding?
Turns out you need blood for a sÃ©ance.
You gonna be good?

Love ya.

You getting it from all angles?
This may sound stupid, but maggie said.
That jesse had a surrogate dad.
Joseph's not jesus' real dad...
Tom.
What?
He has a white truck and rage.
I saw him screaming at his team.
It's hockey.

Is that something your coach would have done?
My coach hit my dad when he took me on a camping trip.
And I missed a game.
Can we be careful here?
We found jesse.
He wasn't alive.
Why?
Baby, people do terrible things.
But not all people and not all the time.
I thought you were more mature.
I just told her about jesse.
Get your stuff ready for the sleepover.
She just got brought home by the cops.
I think she needs to be with her friends right now.
Do you not see what's going on here?
She's worried and she's trying to help.
Whatever possessed you to bring up.
Your dad's suicide the other night -
With all that's going on.
She knows the difference between me and my dad.
He was crazy.
He didn't start out crazy.

C'mon!

This doesn't mean you're not in trouble.
You are my light.
You are my light.
Annie...
I can see you.

That's all I'm saying.

Okay.
Your office said I'd find you here.
Please tell me you've got good news.
I got brewery investors threatening to pull out.
Because they're worried we're about to become famous.
For a hate killing.
What?
I'm upset about jesse too, but people need jobs.
Lily, get in the truck.
"If a hero falls from glory,."
Where can he relive it?
Go!

That's my boy!

Come on!
"Hero.

Now you four are the leaders of this team.
Now we lost our best man, so you need to step up.
Man up!

That means no rifts.
Jacob get over here.

No ice, no padding, away from mom and dad.
And your cushy coddled lives.
You settle your problem like men.
Fight it out.
This is stupid.
Agh!
That's it.

That's it.
I'm gonna kill you, man!
Stop.

Did you feel that?

That kill or be killed primal shit?
That's how jesse played.
That's how he played because he had to.
Now you bring that shit to the ice,
We'll be all right.
Not mediocre, like all these other assholes.
We'll be fucking gods.
Get over here!
We have a visitor.
Hey, you wanna tell me why your late?
Jesse!

Hey!

You stop behaving like a little girl!
Don't touch me, man!

What the hell is this?

Come on!
You need to let this go, kid!
Hello, this is chief peter welland.
Leave a message after the beep.
I'm watching this practice video...

And tom and jesse were so close,
And then a month ago it all changed.
"Don't be scared."
What are you doing here?
There is a truck parked in front of your house.
Is that him?
He didn't hurt me.

He thinks you have a bond, right?

Is that something your hockey coach would do?
Tom heard we were coming to fight.
He stopped us.
We could have killed each other.
The scores been settled.
We can move on.
What is he a fucking ghost?
Do you believe that?

They all swore it.
What's woth the "lord of the flies" blood shit?
He has an alibi, annie.

The riddle's a dad hurting, betraying his son.
Tom.

Is acting weird.
Is the hero jesse?
It was 'til he questioned his gender.
Or is tom the hero who fell from glory after his accident?
And where does he find it again?

He needs jesse for that.

We're not dragging a guy through the mud.
Because some psycho made a painting on a wall, okay?
If tom did anything, we'll get him on evidence.
I'm just throwing stuff against the wall.
I used to be able to do that with you.
My god, don't make this about you.
A kid is dead in a town where my job is to keep the peace.
And I gotta live with that.
And also I gotta rip apart the lives of other people I know.
But I guess you don't care about ripping.
Into other people's lives.

Just because we live in a small town,
Doesn't mean we don't try to solve a murder.
Okay, annie.

Suspicious things.

A lunatic who claimed he knew something about jesse.
Reached out to you and you lied.
And that boy ended up dead.
He died before I lied to you.
And still you ended up making choices, taking a gamble,
Because you thought you knew best.
It's just selfish, ego shit.
And it reminds me of another cop I knew who left.
A 7-year-old behind because he couldn't solve a case.
And what ended up happening with that guy?
He thought he knew best too.

Ended up with the, you know these delusions.
And a fucking bullet in his head!
You need to shut the fuck up right now.
Fuck!
There's restoralax.
Every kid should have a dog.

What are you doing?
I'm just trying to fix it up.
Jesse's dead.
My dad sucked.

I can't, I can't do this right now, annie.
I'm worried about daisy.
A sÃ©ance?

She worships you and I will love you.
Till the day I fuckin' die,
But I do not want my daughter to end up like you.
Why?

Is gonna see her messed-upness,
Take advantage of her and have sex with her?
Okay.

I had teen hormones.

I don't want her to become me either.
I just wanna take care of my kid.
We are taking care of our kid.
What's going on with you?
I don't think you should call around here all hours.
You park outside my house!
That's because I can't face going in.
But I wanna be near you.

I-I shouldn't.

Yeah.

From keeping your head straight.

Let me take you home.
I came here 'cause I don't wanna be alone.
I'm not going home.
Don't do this, annie.

You fucking know what!

Get the fuck off me!
Are you my nighttime stalker?
Yeah.
You write me little notes?

Do you even know how to write?
Hey man.
This woman brings out the worst in me.
So I'd back the fuck off if I were you.
I'm sorry.

One day you're gonna get yourself.
In a shit-load of trouble.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Is that the closest payphone.
To the gas station down the road?
I guess so.
Just a sec.
Jesse used this phone.
We need to pull payphone records from the rattlesnake.
There's a payphone at the rattlesnake?
It's around the back.

I didn't know it was here either.
Let's check it out.

Looks like tom got the boys to fight bare fisted,
For the team.

Hey, annie...
I'm sorry for the things I said earlier.
Yep.
You're here.

You see jesse.

Scared?

But he was the truck when you were supposed to be meeting.
Isn't that weird?
I thought that...
He got cold feet.
Jesse was like amazing.
But I didn't always know what he wanted.
Did anyone else know about your plan to get out of town?
You sure?

Jesse got beat up by a bunch of white jocks.
Who aren't even in trouble!
Where were you planning to go?
We were gonna get on his bike.
And ride 'til no one looked at us funny.
You were going to bicycle out of town?
His motorbike.
Jesse didn't have a motorbike.
He bought one.
He didn't have a job.

There's a crew of rez teens that ride motorbikes.
They had a bike and some cash stolen last month.
There's been word of retaliation for whoever did it.
I'm gonna check this out on the rez.
He ever talk about his coach?
Seemed like he was jesse's hero.
And then a month ago it all changed.
They went to a motel in red bear lake.
Jesse told me he was supposed to meet some scout...
But whatever happened...

I-I meant to...

We had the wildest party.
Tom still has nhl friends.

Anyway, they visit, things get crazy.
Does tom party a lot?

Does tom ever stay out overnight?
What does that have...
Rumors about a motel in red bear lake?
I'd like to put the rumors to rest.
Gotta be a good reason a man takes a 16-year-old kid.
To a motel.

Do you know for sure he took jesse,
Or you just know he went there?
We know he took jesse.
With tom in a position of power over the boys.
He wasn't sleeping with jesse.

He, he used to see a prostitute up there.
For things I won't...
I guess he's back at it.
Was he home the night jesse was killed?
We don't exactly sleep in one bed.
I need you to think about this okay, daniel.
I'm trying to think about this.
Would you rather work at bestbuy.
Or be the best buy?
You need to consider these things.
And what are we gonna do when we get out of here.
If these important questions are not,
You know, on your mind?
You swear I don't get in trouble if I tell you stuff?
Not if you tell me the truth.
Tom comes here.
Last time he brought that kid.

I come in, they barely notice 'cause they're so into each other.
We're gonna win it this year.
Sure there's stuff we gotta work out with the boys.
But they don't see what's going on.
You know, the-the pressure messing up with your head.
I know you, more than you know yourself.
You trust me?
Yeah.
Who's room is this?
Um...

There she is.
Come on over.

Should see the girls after this kid.
Let's start with these.
All right.

He needs a taste and a little confidence.
Man up.
Now you take care of my boy, all right?
I'm fine.
I'm just so...
Fucking tired.
Me too.
He thought we had sex.
I knew you were all man.
Who you are on the ice, man.

That's you.
We're going all the way to the nhl.

And you believe this woman?
But how does that mean that he killed jesse?
Goes back to tom being a hero.
Gets hit by a car, it all goes away.
He spends years seeing a hooker.
He regales with hockey stories to relive glory.
Yeah, but it still doesn't put him with jesse that night.
Explains him going nuts with the boys.
He's desperate not to fade away.
And we know he wasn't home.

When she said, "they 'don't sleep in the same bed."
Well, until she actually does it's nothing though, right?
Where's brady and virginia?

They're still working on.
The motorbike/money angle.
But we're thinking something spontaneous happened.
In the truck.

Tom's got feelings, motives.
Buried so deep, even from himself.
If jesse said something that shamed him,
He could snap.
Tom got a call from the rattlesnake that night, 12:15am.

Hey!

You got a phone call from a payphone.
At the rattlesnake at 12:15 am.
The same night that jesse was killed.
He was seen in a white truck at 1:30 nearby.
Yeah.

Wanted me to pick him up.

Jackie says I care more about him than my girls.
I had to draw boundaries...

Man, my marriage is in trouble.
So why didn't you say anything?
Because I was ashamed.
A month ago your relationship with jesse did a 180.
I guess that's when I told him about needing boundaries.
Claire, the prostitute you took him to,
Paints a different picture.
We can put you two at red bear lake motel.
Yeah.

It fell through.

Paid for skates, brought him to camps...
Everything hockey.
Maybe hockey wasn't everything to jesse.
He would've regretted giving it up.
You know, I'm gonna blow your mind here,
But men are faking it.
Living mediocre lives,
Pr-pretending to love changing diapers.
We were chemically made for a different world.
Where, where we put on armor or, or, or club mammoths.
And hockey gives us that.
And the camaraderie with the guys...
I wanted him to have that.
So you never took him to a hooker?
Is that what you're trying to say here?
Even if I did and-and I didn't -
That, that was like a month ago we went to that motel.
How does it mean I killed him?
It goes to how far you'd go to make sure.
The kid you invested in, created,
Turned into a hero you could live through.
What happened to you - your accident - it's unfair.
But through jesse, you get a taste of the life.
You were supposed to have.
And then he calls you wants a ride to his boyfriend.
Your ticket leaving town.
It's hard to believe you wouldn't try to bring him home.
She in charge now?
Word's gonna get around how you're running this, pete.
How's your temper?
By the way, I remember this junior game,
Guy slew footed him.
His fucking dad had to come down to the ice.
To pull him off the guy.
I mean, he totally snapped.

Can't imagine the rage after all your sacrifices.
And jesse says "I'm done.

'Cause it's your life too.
Without him you go back to barely existing.
Of course you reacted.
Yeah.

He said, man you are fucking pathetic.
You're gonna try to live your life through me?
So you had a bit of an accident.
It makes sense.
You had a heat of the moment reaction.
I was at home the night jesse was killed.
Well, annie, who spoke with your wife,
Is not so certain about that, tom.
You sure you don't wanna get out in front of this?
Well, jackie's happy to clear up any misunderstandings.
She's right outside.
Maggie says jesse never had a motorbike or cash.
Holy shit.

You'll know it's ready the pieces.
Don't stick together anymore.
And that's the gist of dehydrating food.
Am I boring you?
No.

No, I like it.
So can you do it with any fruit?
It's eddie, leave a message.
Half a pound of mdma found in jesse's closet.
Looks like jesse was involved in some sort of distribution.
Is this about the rez teens?

It's rainmaker jed's trademark.
Says it's his spirit animal.
So grossly appropriating a culture.
One knows nothing about would normally piss me off.
But no today.
Nobody goes to the rez.
Until we arrange it with the chief and we get a warrant.
Might make some time but we'll get it.

Jesse called tom.
Yes, and then jackie came in here saying.
You riled her up with this hooker stuff so she lied.
Because she was pissed at him.
Which you shoulda been able to read.
He pays cash for the rooms.
We've got nothing if you don't give a statement.
You said I didn't have to do anything official.
It's why I talked to you.
He works with kids.
People need to know what kind of man he is.
Find someone else then.

Besides, you can't put him in a worse jail.
Than he's already in.
How much you gotta hate yourself to walk into traffic.
I have sex for money and got more self worth.
What do you mean walk into traffic?
Something he said once.

The sigh they made when
"welcome to bellevue, home of tom edmonds" -
He still has it in the arena basement.
Said the boys like to see it.
Do they?

"If a hero falls from glory, where can he relive it?"
In a basement.
So tom gets hit by a van on purpose?
Throws away a career, risks his life,
Days after sandy's killed.
Did anyone look at him for sandy?
We just can't ignore the riddler saying,
There is a connection between these cases.
Look.

And the other one is ritualistic psycho stuff.
I'm not saying it's the same killer.
I'm just saying there's some connection.
And I'm saying, leave it!
No one wants to go back there, annie.
You have to admit, it's fucked up...
He left me a photo.
Tom was Joseph.
What?

There's something the riddler connected
Tom to jesse via Joseph.
Now he's showing me that tom was Joseph in the pageant.
Sandy's pageant.
Was he at the shack?
I can't hear you.
I can't hear you, annie.

A photo.

We need...

Test it against tom.
The shack is burnt, annie!
What?

What?

You went there?

I said don't go there!

I can't hear you.
I can't make out what you're saying.
Hey!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Gasoline?

Because I told peter about the shack?
You can't expect me to just trust...
Shit...

But you can, can't you?
You're taking a chance, telling me things.
All you want is trust.
And instinctually I do trust you.
But you went away and I grew up.
And I lost myself.

Is the first step to finding myself again...
Don't trust the guy with fire in his eyes.
Fire at chief peter welland's.
