Shh, shh.
Okay.
Please help us.
X-ray technician to four south.
I wouldn't give Mr. Richards Methotrax, if I were you.
Allergies, Sam.
Thank you.
You try working 30 hours straight.
Yeah, well, I'm not the one who wanted to be a doctor.
You want to go out to dinner tonight?
How about I just come over after dinner?
You always come over after, but there's never any before.
It's Mrs. Clifford.
Let me just have this one time.
Mrs. Clifford.
Hi, Dorothy.
Just once, I'd like the red.
Thank you.
You little trouble-maker.
Give me that.
It looks like you went to war.
It was sort of like a war, actually.
You got everything but your nails.
This is true, this is true.
But I got those nails.
It is a beautiful color, though.
Come on, give me your hands.
Dorothy.
Aunt Em.
But Stacey, we're looking at a severe weather warning.
Until 11:00 tonight, and, of course, you all remember that awful tornado that swept through...
There's a mix of 50s and 100s in there.
50s are yellow.
Just don't mix 'em up, Aunt Em, please.
I told you to stop doing this.
And I told you to stop lifting with your back
You went to see her, didn't you?
Karen.
It's all right.
She wouldn't have written you if she didn't want you to know her.
I'm sure that's why she moved back here.
Yeah, well, nothing gets better in my truck, but nothing gets worse.
Dorothy, she's your mother.
You're my mother.
And if she really wanted to know me, she would've reached out 20 years ago.
Do you want to know what I wished for?
I wished I was more.
Nothing fancy or nothing to brag about, just...
I don't know, I always imagined that when I'd meet her,
I'd be... more.
That's a fine wish, but wishing doesn't make it so.
What if she's nothing like I imagined?
What if I'm nothing like how she imagined?
Only one way to find out.
Karen!
Ms. Chapman!
Karen?
Karen!
Ms. Chapman?
No.
Dorothy?
Dorothy...
Dorothy.
No, nobody can come in here.
Dorothy, no police.
Police not good.
You have to run!
Hey, hey!
Hey... hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
No, no, no, no, no, don't shoot!
No, no, don't shoot!
No!
She's...
Aah!
God.
My God.
No, no, no, no, no.
Hello, hello, hello?
God, what's happening?
Bad dog.
I'm sorry, I don't understand you.
Good dog.
These are the Tribal Free Lands.
You are trespass.
Excuse me, I don't know how I got here.
Please?
You... y-y-you found her.
You know this woman?
Um, there was an accident, and... she...
She stepped in front of me.
You killed her.
This woman!
I tried to help...
Witch.
You killed the Mistress of the Eastern Wood, the Most Merciful and Stern.
I told you, it was an accident.
Only a witch can kill a witch.
Or The Beast Forever.
You are no beast.
And I'm no witch.
Why are you doing this to me?
I am Ojo of the Tribal Free Lands.
You are trespass.
No, no, no, no!
I was gonna go see my mother and I don't know...
I don't know how I got here, but please!
Please just don't put me back in the water.
I don't know anything.
Please!
She has sisters.
In the West and in the North.
And the Wizard of Oz... you will most certainly have to answer to the Wizard of Oz.
Why do I get the feeling, Isabel, when I stop playing, you're gonna deliver some horrible news?
Something has happened in the East.
Sir.
This drone was over the Tribal Free Lands last night near the Munja'kin village.
Wait.
Slower.
Closer, closer.
But it tore the sky.
And that is the First True Sign.
Now The Beast Forever will rise.
Go East, Eamonn.
Find out who or what fell from the sky.
Make sure it stays fallen.
Don't you want your High Council to examine the First True Sign?
If it's alive, kill it.
If it's dead, bury it.
Whatever it is, it doesn't come back here.
Doesn't come back to Emerald City.
What's happening?
A decision has been made.
You are to be exiled from the Tribal Free Lands, never to return.
I will take you to our border.
And then what?
And then you will step over it.
Your toto looks hungry.
My toto?
"Toto" is dog in our language.
Are you a healer?
I guess.
I like to help people.
When they're not trying to drown me.
What is that?
Is that the beast you were talking about?
No.
The Beast Forever drowned this and hundreds like it.
So the beast is a flood?
Beast Forever takes many forms.
Floods that meet the sky.
Fires that water cannot extinguish.
Monstrosities that slither and soar.
So how do you stop it?
Who stopped it before?
A wizard.
With those.
Eternal Warriors.
They formed a wall around Emerald City to keep The Beast Forever from flooding our entire world.
Yeah, definitely not Kansas.
Mistress of the Western Fields.
Vessel of Truth and Solace.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
You should have sent someone ahead.
I did.
Well, you should have sent someone else.
Especially when they're afraid.
There's rumors of magic.
If it were magic, it wouldn't be yours, would it?
The rip in the sky?
No.
No magic here.
I found a new line of work, thanks to you.
So poppy business up, whores exhausted, blood in the sky, and you perambulating around the people with Glinda's girls.
It has begun.
There is no doubt.
You may know everything there is to know about The Beast Forever.
I'm sure my sister in the North only picks the best and brightest for the Wizard's Council.
Mistress West...
But you were a baby the last time it came.
You wouldn't be so eager to reach that conclusion...
Enough!
How far along are you?
Chaste?
Helps keep them focused on saving the world.
Isn't that Glinda's only rule?
I couldn't do it.
Too much love to be had.
He's the father.
Safest way, around.
Shortest way, through.
Then I vote around.
Around as we can go.
Through.
What is this place?
A prison.
Prison of the Abject.
Most secure.
For anyone who violates the Wizard's law against magic.
Who's that?
My wife.
You killed the witch that put them here.
Maybe the only one who can free them.
Follow the brick road to the Emerald City.
The Wizard is there.
Tell your apologies to him.
Can this Wizard take me home?
That's all I want, I just...
I just really want to go home.
The Wizard is great and powerful.
He can get you home.
Poppy pollen.
Opium.
Thanks.
Do not thank me.
I voted to have you killed.
Um, Toto?
Help me.
You okay?
I can't feel my arms.
You have a deep wound here.
What happened to you?
I...
How about your name?
What's your name?
No!
I'm just gonna check your head.
I'm a healer.
I think you're too late.
This is probably yours.
It was at your feet.
I'm gonna put it away, okay?
It's getting dark.
We should try and find some food.
Am I coming with you?
I don't know.
Are you?
Wizard's Guard approaching!
The girl is gone.
But the Witch of the East remains.
That looks good.
Could you, um...
I wish I could say I'm not usually this useless, but, um... maybe I am.
You don't look useless.
How do I look?
I actually don't know what I look like.
You're very h...
Very...?
We should name you.
Even the dog has a name.
Well, whatever you want to call me.
No.
No, that's too much responsibility.
Well, I try to avoid responsibility and permanence.
What's the first name that comes to your mind?
Lucas?
Is it terrible?
Why Lucas?
It's the town where I grew up.
So Lucas is home?
All right.
Well, Lucas it is.
Dorothy.
Dorothy.
Dorothy.
Hey, you're hurt.
Prison...
Prison of Abject.
I woke with the strangest taste in my mouth.
You.
Aah!
Do you know who I am?
Witch!
S-S-Stern.
Merciful and Stern.
Steel won't help you, swordsman.
Unless you want to open your neck and end your hurt.
That's the merciful part.
Why did you come for me?
I didn't!
Are you one of Glinda's girls?
Did she send you to kill me?
My sister...
My sister with her secrets.
I came through a tornado.
I don't know how, but I did.
In Oz, nothing good ever comes from the sky.
So when something does, we try to send it back in pieces.
Put that down.
Put it down, it's dangerous.
I'll be the judge of that.
I'll be the judge of everything.
Don't!
Or what?
My, my.
So pretty and so stupid.
Only a witch can kill a witch.
What does it do and how does it work?
Let him go and I'll say.
I don't make deals.
You're pointing it the wrong way.
See?
That wasn't so hard, was it?
The Witch of the East is dead.
By whose hand, we don't know.
Sir, this was magic.
Strong enough to kill a cardinal witch.
Glinda.
No.
There is only one man to blame.
20 years ago...
King Pastoria and the magic realm fought The Beast Forever.
They fought bravely.
And they lost.
If it were not for me,
Emerald City would have fallen like many great cities of Oz.
I will protect you from The Beast Forever, who ravages our land.
I will protect you from the forbidden magic in the woods.
I will protect you because I am the Great and Powerful.
Wizard of Oz!
Dorothy.
We should go.
Where does the road lead?
To Emerald City.
To the Wizard of Oz.
And he can help you?
Yeah.
He can move mountains.
And he can probably take me home.
Maybe he can fix my head.
What's Eamonn looking for?
The girl went round the mountain, and he's staring through it.
Has he gone mad?
Why don't you go and ask him?
Think I won't?
I'm not spending another night out here.
Would you mind telling us what we're still doing here?
Ojo said the girl went round the pass.
Ojo was lying.
I think I'll meet Glinda at the foot of the Eternal Warrior.
Show of strength.
But meeting her halfway... shouldn't you make her come to you?
If I didn't know better, I'd think you were on my side, Isabel.
Glinda may have chosen me, but I serve you.
Your pregnancy says otherwise.
Glinda of the North has arrived.
Witches.
You may have outlawed their magic, but your people still love them.
'Cause they don't know them.
The Bowler said he'd never seen a wound like it before.
A hole.
Carved neatly out of our sister's head.
She was to see me when it happened.
Matters of great import.
Any idea what?
You look terrible.
It's been 20 years.
Time ravages... how would you have me look?
Like you didn't just crawl out of a poppy field.
Where I crawl is none of your problem.
It is, actually.
The Wizard has granted my request to open our sacred temple.
But it won't make any difference if your tongue's not right.
My tongue is perfect.
We are the last Cardinal Witches, you and I.
If you cannot sing your sister properly and right her to rest, then she will be the last.
And we'll be nothing.
I will sing her properly and right.
I'll get us what we need.
Then we can put another 20 years between us.
So I say "Who's there?" even though I know it's you.
Let's just try it again.
Knock, knock.
Knock, knock.
Why are you knocking?
What about... baseball?
Have you ever heard of baseball?
I might have.
Who's to say?
Do you remember anything from here?
Anything you recognize or makes you feel something?
You.
How long have you been saving that?
A few miles.
Eamonn.
Eamonn!
We shouldn't be here.
What is this place?
Cesspool of witches.
And look at him.
Wizard's right-hand man.
Gonna get us all killed hunting for some girl who fell from the sky.
So I'll tell you what...
Break south, find the girl ourselves, ride back to Emerald City with her head, then we'll have the Wizard's loyalty.
Naw, Eamonn's not gonna let us break off.
Yeah, you're right.
Guess we'll have to kill him.
We'll cut him into bits.
Make it look like lions did it.
Do you want me to slow down?
You must really want to get home.
Yeah, I have people waiting for me.
What kind of people?
People.
I'm not having this conversation with you, Lucas.
Well, you saved me, so how does that work?
No.
Lucas?
Put pressure, okay?
We're gonna get you help.
You're just a little septic, but I've already stopped the bleeding, so you're fine.
All you need is a shot of penicillin... it's the most common drug in the world.
My world.
Hi, sir, my friend is dying, and I need some medicine.
Do you know where I can find any?
Medicine...
Doctor, pharmacy.
For him.
Yes, an apothecary.
Where can I find one?
She don't take to visitors.
Look, sir, I'm begging you... please.
I just need to know where she is, otherwise he's gonna die.
What are you up to, boy?
Ma'am?
There's a chill.
I'm all right.
It's time for your medicine.
I think no more of that, love.
You need rest.
I'm off to get a chicken for dinner.
You're leaving?
How much time do we have?
She went to the butcher's.
I can't take it anymore, Jack.
You've got to find a way in.
Today's the day.
May I present Maiden of Northern Light,
Mother of the Sound and Pure, and the Mistress of the Western Fields,
Vessel Solace...
Yeah, yeah, Vessel, solace, truth...
I spend half my life waiting to walk in and out of rooms.
Glinda.
It's been some time.
The North is always open to you.
Isabel?
This is Anna.
She'll be true and chaste, without distraction of body and mind.
To better serve you.
Nope, nope.
Come.
Come, listen and learn.
My condolences regarding your Eastern sister.
We appreciate you unsealing our temple so we can honor her properly.
I know that wasn't possible with Mother South.
The Beast Forever was merciless with her.
So...
I have a request of my own.
Mistress East and I, we had a partnership.
The Prison of the Abject.
Yes, an unfortunate name.
An unfortunate prison.
Wasn't my creation.
We can't unlock it, if that's what you want.
So whatever magic she used to open it,
I give you my permission to re-create it.
I wish we could, but a witch's spells are her own.
And there are a thousand variations.
Normally, East would've had an apprentice to pass along the fruit of her tongue, but you put an end to all that, didn't you?
If there's nothing else, we have preparations to make.
You feeling all right, Mistress?
Perfect.
Jack!
Look, it's too hard.
Not until I'm through.
Yeah.
Get the heck out of here.
Jack, someone's coming up the hill.
I'm looking for a woman called Mombi.
Hey!
It's gonna be okay.
My friend needs help.
Your friend is past help.
Do you have any honey?
What about goldenseal or chaparral?
You can use what you can find and then be on your way.
Miss?
Forgive me, it was wrong of me not to offer help.
Bring him inside.
Thank you.
That's very kind of you.
I've got just the thing for him.
You're having one of your days.
No, ma'am.
It's all right, boy, I know it must be hard sometimes just being cooped up in here.
Who would want that?
But with your condition, to be exposed to all that's out there...
At least with this, you're still alive.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm going to go and check on our guests.
Your potion seems to be working.
It's just an herbal remedy.
What kind of witch are you?
I'm not.
But I get that a lot here.
And you?
How long have you been in the Wizard's Guard?
Um...
I don't know.
Cross stitch at the hilt.
Ceremonial hilt.
Wizard's Guard.
So...
I have a not-witch, whose potions raise the dead, and a not-Wizard's Guard who carries their sword.
What else are you not?
I don't know what you're asking.
He's telling the truth.
When I found him in Nimbo, he was barely alive.
So it was you.
He couldn't even remember his name.
I know what the Wizard's Guard did at Nimbo.
Burned and tortured.
No, what they did to those people, they did to me, too.
And yet you carry their sword.
Whatever you've done... however many you've killed... whatever un... thinkable horror you perpetrated...
Your mind has done the same thing back.
Made it un... thinkable.
Dorian.
Dorian!
Dorian.
Poor sod.
Lions.
Think how many sisters have been sung to rest here.
I'd rather not.
When this is done, when we have what we need, you can go back to forgetting.
Am I interrupting?
These doors... haven't been unsealed for a generation.
But I hear the ceremony is beautiful.
So I'm opening up the funeral to the public.
I think it's time that my people are reminded what Oz used to be.
Yeah.
What witches... used to be.
That lunatic hopes to embarrass you.
Us.
I'll be perfect.
Toto!
Toto!
No!
Go.
_
Who's up there?
I think it's time for you and the Wizard's Guard to leave.
Why did they write that?
Tell me or I'm gonna go get help.
It's a boy.
It's just a... a sweet, sweet boy... who's prone to hysterics.
Who you keep locked up.
Why do you think I live in a town with no name?
A place on no map.
It's to protect him.
From what?
From everything.
I may not be his mother, but I feel what all mothers feel.
All the time.
In everything.
From the minute they are born into the world, the world tries to take them right back.
Well, you can't protect him forever.
Did your mother protect you?
Don't you wish she had?
Forever and always?
Now you understand.
We'll speak of it no more.
Anna, is it?
Where are the others?
They're preparing for the funeral.
Not the best circumstance for your inaugural time.
It gives me a chance to familiarize myself with your science.
Must be overwhelming.
On the contrary, it feels... like second nature.
Numbers and patterns and theorems.
They're beautiful.
As beautiful as magic.
Would you like to join me for the funeral?
I hear it's quite a show.
Out of my way.
What did you do?
Nothing you need to worry for.
You let him do this to you.
No one does anything to me.
I will...
If you get this wrong.
I will.
Which do you think I am?
A murderer or a traitor?
Isn't it?
Like you said... who knows who you are.
Or what you've done.
I don't know if it's true.
It doesn't feel like me.
Keep the sword, if it puts your mind at ease.
Do you know what would put me at ease?
Us getting out of here.
Lucas.
Lucas, you've been poisoned.
So I need you to put your head to the side and open your mouth.
Open your mouth!
Stay with me, Lucas.
Stay with me.
Stay with me, Lucas.
Stay with me.
This is charcoal.
It'll soak up the poison.
You have to drink it all.
Swallow, Lucas, swallow.
Dorothy.
Did you get them?
Are her spells inside you?
You wretched waste.
My tongue... perfect.
Come on, we're getting you out of here.
Jack!
We have to get out of here now.
Come on, come on!
Tip!
Toto, go!
Damn it!
There's not enough.
We can find more.
Unlock the door!
Tip!
No.
I'm not stealing from her.
I don't want any part of her.
Tip!
Tip, wait!
Let me out of here!
I order you!
Come on!
What have you done with him?
Where's the child?
He's gone.
You have no idea what you've done!
He's free.
I... was... protecting him!
I was saving him!
You... aah!
Lucas?
Lucas, stop.
Stop!
We'd have lived a year on what that dagger would have sold for.
Why'd she have it?
I don't know.
She never told me anything.
But if I took it, it would have been a part of her that followed me around.
You all right?
I need that medicine.
What if it's the only thing keeping me alive?
I got "bad blood."
Heck, who doesn't?
How is your sister?
Alive, no thanks to you.
What she does, she does to herself.
What she does, she usually does in private.
For a ruler expecting The Beast Forever, you spend the goodwill of your friends freely.
Am I your friend?
Truly?
I've outlawed your gifts.
My Eternal Warrior stands poised to lay waste to your temple.
Mother South is dead.
Which means there'll be no more witches born in Oz.
How can you say I'm your friend and mean it?
You've saved Oz when magic could not.
You charged me with selecting your High Council.
And I extended my hand.
I always assumed you'd taken it.
Safe travels north.
I'm sure you'll have less fanfare on your departure than you did on your arrival.
Knock, knock.
Knock, knock.
Knock, knock.
Tip?
Tip!
Tip?
Tip?
Is that you?
Hey, that's my friend's coat!
Stop!
Stop!
What're you doing with that coat?
It's mine.
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine.
What?
It's me, Jack.
Something's happened.
Tip?
