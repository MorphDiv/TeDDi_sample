You've been charged with conduct unbecoming.
The CFD needs to protect its imagine and its reputation.
They're suspending you for 60 days without pay.
You are so out of touch.
You have no right just barging into my home!
Why does he owe that guy money?
Matt Casey says, we need to earmark funds for our first responders.
Smells an awful lot like self-dealing to me.
Maybe...
Maybe what we need is some of that swamp draining right here in Chicago.
Alderman Matt Casey right here wants to take your hard earned tax dollars and dole it out to his buddies in the CFD.
That's right, but what I am trying to do is stop him.
I am not your typical politician.
We didn't elect you to slide money to your friends.
Ma'am, if you'll just let me...
Please, if you'll just let me talk.
I can exp...
Sit with me.
Life, Matt.
You can actually eat it up by the spoon.
Um, Matty, it would be great if instead of skim milk, we could get some 2%.
We'll do that.
Thanks, buddy.
How long is your dad gonna stay here?
Till he gets on his feet.
It's up to him, I guess.
Hey, Joe, could I... could I have a word with you?
I'm eating.
He's just trying to wrap his head around that 60 day suspension.
Truck 81, Ambulance 61, vehicle accident, 291 North LaSalle.
Hey, is the north leaf of the LaSalle bridge up?
51, where are you?
Hey.
Okay, hey, pal.
I need you to try to climb up here to me, okay?
Only the bravest kids go to Brookridge.
Hey, we're gonna need more of these extinguishers, Lieutenant!
We're out!
Mouch, get that ladder in there.
Good.
We gotta move, Herrmann.
All right, good.
Come on.
Got him.
Got him.
Here we go.
Coming down.
Easy.
Got him, Mouch.
Arm is positive with crepitus.
Dad, my cards.
My cards!
Yeah, what's this now?
He had all the Cubs cards signed by the World Series team.
Hey, you know, I was a baseball card kid, too.
Cubbies all the way.
Hey, who's your favorite player?
Kris Bryant, of course.
Thanks.
I just want to say...
I feel awful about your suspension hearing, and I'm very, very sorry, but, Joe...
I tried.
It's important to me that you know that.
When you told me not to worry,
I didn't worry because I trusted you.
But now... because you're so completely out of touch with how the system works,
I have to call my little brother and tell him that he can't go to college next semester.
So, yeah... you tried.
But try making that phone call.
Hey, Dawson.
How is that kid from the call on the bridge?
Fracture's pretty bad.
Might need surgery.
Damn.
Hey.
Um, so I just...
I want you to know that this situation with my dad
I'm even willing to pick up a construction job or two
What he needs is some tough love.
I'm all for him figuring out his life, but he's interfering in ours while he does it.
Maybe I want him to do it with me.
I'm getting screamed at by an angry mob like I'm Frankenstein.
They were ready to pitchfork me right there on the stage.
Then I come home, and Ramon thinks he's Sigmund Freud because he's eating a bowl of Life cereal.
How long is he staying?
Ask my wife, 'cause I can't.
Hey, how's Cruz?
He's in his own world.
Yeah.
His heart's in the right place, but his emotions rule the day.
Maybe time off is just what he needs.
Ambulance 61, man down from unknown causes.
3401 East Union.
Man, we should do this more often.
Life, I'm not talking the cereal, is too short.
Yeah.
If I had a heart attack, I'm sure they'd send the bacon.
The cops are on their way, ma'am.
I've got a tenant that's whipping someone.
What?
Shouldn't you wait for the police?
Chastened with pain on his bed!
And with unceasing complaint in his bones!
My God.
Stop!
Man is chastened with pain on his bed.
And unceasing complaint in his bones!
Hold him down, hold him down.
Hold him down, hold him down.
Man is chastened with pain!
And with unceasing complaint in his bones.
Man is chastened...
Give us some room.
Ma'am, I'm gonna need some towels.
Let's tape him up.
Blakeslee wants the money for his Gold Coast beach renovation.
Now, he knows that your bill beats his all day long.
Straight up.
So he tosses some mud the water.
As long as a firefighter is introducing a first responder bill, it's gonna look hinky.
Blakeslee is gunning for a final consideration vote
I haven't even had a chance to present it to the full council.
All right, so figure out a way to give him what he wants so you can get what you want.
Tamara, you're truly wired for this life.
Can you make it to the next town hall?
Kelly.
Headquarters has been reviewing whether Squad 3 can have an extra man on its roster permanently.
Now, the Kannell situation makes it difficult, but I'm gonna leave it up to you to choose who goes into the floater pool.
At a Halloween party once.
Last year.
Huah-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!
That's exactly what you told me to do.
Lieutenant.
Everything all right?
It doesn't seem like it.
I'm here, right?
Yeah, you are... and the city of Chicago thanks you.
Hey, Leon.
Listen, I need to talk to you about next semester.
Corporate said your phone interview went great.
The job is yours if you want it.
Commissions are negotiable, and we just want to make you happy.
You bring in more business, the scale slides upward.
The company's looking to get into turnout coats, gloves, fire boots.
You know, not just equipment, but apparel.
The stuff will sell itself.
You with me?
It sounds like a great opportunity.
Look, I know this is a big change.
Take it from me, you pull the trigger on this, it's the greatest choice you'll ever make.
End of the week?
Yeah.
And thanks, Nick.
I'll talk to you Friday.
Hey, can you tell me where a Hogan something or another is?
Kid was in a car accident.
Blowing the lead and the rain delay...
It was the best day of my life.
For a lot of us, Hogan.
The whole city!
I collected baseball cards, too.
I had everyone from the '89 Cubs autographed, too.
Listen.
I wanna give you those cards.
Just to help make up for what you lost.
There's no better place for them than with a fan like you.
Letting Maddux go was such a typical Cubs move.
Hey!
We need some help in here!
He's not breathing.
T.D. Must be a reaction to the compazine.
I need 25 of diphenhydramine.
Now!
Compazine is what we give to patients for nausea with their pain meds.
Reactions are rare, but it happens.
Christopher, what are you doing?
Where are my baseball cards?
The ones you sold?
What?
Garage sale, 2002.
You wanted to buy those cross-country skis.
No.
What cross-country skis?
The ones you sold in garage sale 2007 for the mountain bike we sold in 2010.
Hey, how's it going, buddy?
Say... you like peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies?
My wife, she made them this morning.
Gabriela, I can almost see the bottom of this glass.
We are gonna have to name that barstool after you, Ramon.
No greater honor can a man have.
Excuse me, young lady,
I have to see a man about a urinal.
I don't want to get in the way of that.
Charming.
His social skills are a little rusty.
Hey, Cruz, how many you had?
Not enough.
Ain't that right, Mouch?
Cruz.
Get it together, or find somewhere else.
Or maybe find something else.
Loud and clear, Lieutenant!
No reason we both can't get what we want, right?
You know my bill is good for the city and has nothing
You've got your own bill coming up for the Gold Coast?
Beach improvements for the over-funded and already nicest section of the city.
Listen, as long as I can help my people,
I'll help yours.
I can live with that.
I'll pledge my support at the town hall tomorrow.
You can count on me as long as I can count on you.
I give you my word.
My daughter and Matt told me everything about you and your, double-dealing.
Alderman Casey, keep your bill.
You go slither back from wherever you came from.
I'll find somewhere else to sleep tonight.
Matt.
Matt.
Hey.
How are you doing, pal?
Been better.
What's going through that melon of yours?
Remember Scotty Bell?
He was a great one.
Not many left from my class.
Out of 36, only me, Longmiller, and John Nowak are still active.
Everyone else... retired or gone.
It's me.
I'm not what I used to be.
I feel old.
Hey, Trudy!
Hey, Christopher.
I got your message.
Got here as soon as I could.
What'cha doing?
Limping down memory lane.
What a blast from the past.
And look at that hunk in the middle row!
Long time ago.
What's going on, baby?
Just thinking.
I'm listening.
I think maybe... it's time.
Hey.
You're being selfish.
I slept at Severide's, and I texted you that.
I don't give a damn what you texted.
That is not how marriage works, Matt.
Talking involves listening, Gabby, and you're not doing that.
Listen, I understand you wanting to help out your dad.
You do?
Because you're really, really not showing it.
You are way more concerned about your alderman job
My first responder bill will probably die because of it.
No thanks to your father, by the way.
I got something else I have to do.
Peachy.
What's going on?
My dad.
All of it?
Talk to me.
My dad's been crashing at my house, and Matt had enough.
He didn't come home last night.
That's doesn't sound like him.
Next chance you get, right?
Don't miss that chance.
Yeah.
What's up, Cubs fan?
Mr. Herrmann?
Of course!
So, listen, have you ever ridden in a fire truck?
I know that I promised you my old baseball cards, but then I got thinking, and I thought, maybe I can give you a real experience instead, so as we like to say in the firehouse,
let's go for a ride.
Get up there.
This is awesome.
Hit it, Otis.
Public trust has never been lower.
You have aldermen like Matt Casey who takes advantage of you, but doesn't have the decency to show up and say it to your faces.
Decency?
Does decency include improvements to Gold Coast projects simply because that's where the tax money comes from?
Alderman Casey, you don't have the floor.
A lot has been said about me being a fireman.
But this bill... this initiative
I've been trying to get passed has nothing to do with me being a fireman and everything to do with me as a human being.
The first responders who show up when you call 911 deserve to know that this city has their backs if the unthinkable happens.
And it happens.
Sometimes men and women answer the bell... don't come home.
But Alderman Blakeslee has made it clear that I can't speak up about this bill because of appearances.
Well, Alderman Blakeslee,
I like this appearance.
I like being a firefighter, and I would never want my position in the CFD to jeopardize what is right for the heroes of Chicago.
But the truth is...
My job has gotten in the way of my responsibilities as an alderman... and as a husband.
That's not okay for the best city in America.
Which is why...
I will be stepping down as alderman.
I would like to nominate Tamara Jones to fill my seat.
Tamara is a public school teacher, and an advocate for the voiceless in this city.
So while me and my fellow first responders will continue to put our lives on the line for you,
I urge you to give your voice to Tamara because this woman will not go unheard.
For all of you.
That's enough!
Get up there and let this crowd know how you feel.
Well... how y'all doing today?
Well, that's enthusiasm!
'Cause together, we cannot be stopped.
No way.
Somebody wants to meet you.
Are you Hogan?
Yeah, Kris Bryant.
I heard you might be missing an autograph.
Would you mind?
You're the best.
Hey, Jake, Hogan here is moving from pitcher to third base.
Bad idea unless you want to work every day.
Hey, Jake.
Hey!
I love Mike Tirico.
Can... can you sign it?
Yeah.
Truck 81, factory fire at 4545 South Carroll.
Everybody get out?
This is my last shift.
This is it.
It's time.
All right, let's move!
Listen up, okay, they're saying trapped workers, but I already don't like this smoke.
51, let's get a line in there.
We'll take the north end of the building.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Truck 81, right in there.
81, let's move!
Chief, squad 3's inside.
Copy that!
Dawson, Brett, we're coming out with two.
Call out!
Fire department, call out!
Fire department, call out!
Okay, that's it.
I want all firefighters to evacuate the building immediately.
I repeat!
All firefighters will evacuate the building now!
Hey!
You heard him, Mouch, we gotta get out of here now!
Mouch, you all right?
Mouch!
I think Mouch is having a heart attack!
What's your location, Herrmann?
Northwest corner!
Come on.
Get down!
Severide, what is your position?
Can you assist Casey?
Kannell!
Stay focused, Dawson.
You're not dying in here, you old loaf!
You got it?
Chief!
The fire jumped!
We got surrounded!
Chief, we can get 'em.
Capp, Tony, on a hose line.
Let's go, Cruz.
No.
Cruz!
Herrmann, entrance is blocked.
You put Mouch on your shoulder if you have to, but you get the hell out.
Casey, evacuate that building any way you can.
Again!
Again!
Again!
Mouch.
I'm so sorry, Mouch.
Please don't die on us.
My God.
No!
Casey, tell me you've found an exit.
Negative, Chief.
Less than a minute.
Can you...
Chief, is Gabby there?
Gabby... you know how much you mean to me, right?
Matt, did you take your mask off?
I want you to hear my voice.
No, don't you say that, Matt.
You get out of there!
You're the best thing to ever happen to me.
Matt, don't!
Use your halligan or your hands.
You find a wall and you break it down!
Don't say it.
Gabby...
Gabby... 14
I want you to remember us happy, together, holding each other.
You were my miracle, Gabby.
You were my miracle.
I love you.
