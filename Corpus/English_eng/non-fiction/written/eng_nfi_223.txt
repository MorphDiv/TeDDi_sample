"What are you doing on the kerb?

"I was waiting for you to drive me to your house to play with all my tight holes."
But why are you just waiting on the kerb and how did you know that he'd be there?
"I've even got a daughter that looks like you."
OK, well that's just 100% disgustingness, innit?
"My feelings are so intense."
Feelings are so intense?

My mum is away for the first night since I was born and this is what...
No, man, I can't watch this stuff no more.
Cos, one day, I was, like, rah, hold on!
If there's a camera that close to my face, she must know the stare.
Hold on.

This some kind of acting, or something?
From time I realised that, yeah, me and my pillow are losing interest.
See, my mind, yeah, is woke.
I don't think they're having sex, it's some kind of motion graphics or something.
And it's fake.

She look like that blonde chick from Homeland.
Why is she messing with this tired and retired brokeback man?
Trust me, yeah.

Cynthia!

- I'm going to meet Aaron's parents tomorrow.

- Cool!

No, no, no, I can't make one, you know.
- I've got a shift in the shop.

It's all right because you're not invited.

Wow!

So I've been there for the whole of this relationship...
- Tracey!

- in the whole of this shebang.

- Aaron!

Three is a bit of a crowd.
Yeah, we are the three.
But it's a bit of a crowd, babe.
- A bit crowdy.

Yeah, I see what you mean.
Ah!

Sexual liberation planner, here we go.
Smell nice.

Be commercially attractive.
Safe alcohol abuse.
Dear God, I pray you send me a man with whom I have a connection who will release the virginity from my thighs and thus I will be liberated.
Amen.
♪ I'm going, holiday. ♪
- No!

You need to tell them they're not coming.
I can't.

Why do you always have to go on like your balls ain't dropped yet?
That's how girlfriends keep their boyfriends these days, yeah?
I don't want a boyfriend.

So, guys, you said three was a bit of a crowd.
- So, I followed it all up.

So now we are four of a crowd.
♪ Italy, 2013, Italy, 2013. ♪
What are you doing?
Well, I've heard people chant all sorts of places and years.
- Why can't I do my own?

When they are going to go on...
Know what?

Is your mum going to make apple crumble?

It must be weird, living with your mum and dad.
The train, the train.
It is moving.

Choo-choo!

OK.

Make sure you lubricate the finger/fingers.
Where is Ola?
- I haven't seen him since he went to the toilet.

Aaron, Tracy, Candice!
Mark and Ian are my new friends.
Ian is in a wheelchair.

I don't usually like other browns.
So you are here for one night only?
- One night only.

We're on Grace Road.

It's two minutes from mine but I don't think you should just go off with him.
It is not easy for us as minorities.

Ooh.
Yes, black people, I'm a member of many private minority groups.
Black, gay, the working classes,
- Irish...

Apple crumble!
Where to find a man.
Are you lost?
Yes, I've walked too far from home.
What's the road?
Clavell Street, Pensbourne Estate.
Would you like to take me there?
Pensbourne Estate is just round the corner.
Well then, let's go.
But you should lead though.

Aaron, you never told me your mum and dad were living like Drake.
Yeah, well they are.

She sent "Sorry."
Ah, fuck!
Oh.

Your mum's left me.

Come on, come on, man!
Well, I like games, board games...
Why are you telling me this?
Well, because you should have asked already.
And as my sister Tracy will be back tomorrow,
I don't want to waste any time that's all.
- Is this like a set-up?

You're the one that brought me here.
I'd like a cup of wine, please.
- It's your house.

There's a bottle and two cups on the hatch.
If you'd just...

Hope you're having as good a time as I am.
Mag-a-luf 2014!
Mag-al-uf 2015.
Mag-a-luf 2013.
Magaluf... 2014.

Magaluf...

OK, I'm ready.
For what?
To fuck.
All right, come on, do what you're best at.

See ya.
- Are you playin' Aaron's dad?

No.

He's probably got a drip hidden... in his muscular bum.
Don't fuck with me.

- on my fucking name!

I've never seen an ugly man with booty like that, OK?
Let me observe.

Why's there got to be sexual feelings involved?
What's all the noise?
We were just saying how lovely your house is and how welcoming you've been.
That's a lot of shite, isn't it?
Oh.
You know, girls like this.
"Hi, I'm Clarissa."
"Oh, my gosh, you're gay."
- Well, then.

Oh.

Tell me your coming out story.

- Arrgh!

Oh, Derek's at Freedom's.
He's bored!

Derek, look at you!
- I really want to kiss you.

Ola, say hi.

Oh!

Ian, you look tired.
Well, this has been fun.
You don't need a cab or something?
It's just round the corner, isn't it?
Yeah.

Text me your snapchat and we'll keep in touch, yeah?
I want to slap my face with it.
Yes.
So I would really appreciate it if that happened.
- Come here.

No, no, no, we can't.
He has been so nice to me.
- No.

Amazing.

See you later, Ola.

How long do you think he will take?
Well, the shop is a very long walk away.
Thank you, Jesus.
Tracey!
Oh, come on.
You've got to admit he's all right.
I'm not crazy.

Just keep your eyes on the TV.
Candice, that's hard, and I'm on holiday.
You've got to admit he's all right.

- Keep your eyes...

- He could be your dad.

He could be your dad.

And it's not because he's old.

Look at Connor.

- So what?

Fuckin' Barnes, reffing.
One red card, fucking hundreds to go.
I forgot.

Actually, Dad, I've been body-building and that.
What, like a gay?
What are you doing, drinking protein shakes?
Trying to drop that baby fat?
Try dropping your balls first, son.
A-ha-ha-ha!

I've just said that same thing today.
What are you saying about my son?
What?

- you've brought him up...

Eh, I didn't bring him up.

He didn't have any biceps.
And he lost his grip and grazed his little boobies on the pavement, didn't you?

- Will you stop it, please?

Got some big man boots in London, have you?
Now he's wearing them, but do they fit?
Are you sure you're a big man?
Come on.

What have you got?
What have you got in them triceps, eh?
- Tempt me!

This is a great holiday.

Right, so you want to do sex?
Are you just going to give it to me?
Well, I'm not giving it to you, we're sharing it!
This ain't a set-up?
There ain't no cameras here?
- All right.

I've broken my hymen in preparation, so I'll lie down.
And, er...
At my pace, please!
And now just put it around my knicker area.
OK.
And now, enter the dome, with your penis.
Are you enjoying it?
Yes, but if you keep talking, it's going to go down.
Is it tight?
OK, you can say stuff like that.
Is it tight?
- Yeah.

Virgin tightness has been scientifically debunked.
Intercourse does not stretch the vagina...
Well, it does, but it just shrinks it down to what it was before, so that means, if we do this again, we'll be having the exact same experience we're having right now.
Are you having fun?
Hey, Ian, I'm back!
Oh, my God!

Oh, Jesus!
Don't worry.
Where did you put all the fucking snacks?
Right, well,
I guess I've just got to be honest.
I've never been around a man your age, so I don't know what the pull is, but there a pull and...

Yes, I...
I totally fancy you.
I don't know how you feel, you don't have to say...
Actually, no, how do you feel?
- How do I feel?

I'm hungry.
Me too...

My feelings are so intense.
Right, Aaron, this is serious, then, is it?
Yeah, I love her.
Where you from, Candice?
I guess some sort of council block?
- What have you done with your savings?

- Why, what are you implying?

You've got backup funds?
How much?

Are you spiritual?
Do you have a degree?

- Anything?

Because my assumption, right, is that the answer to these questions are no, no, and no.
At the end of the day, what are you doing to increase his points as a man?
He is now very angry and saying very crazy things.
- It's amazing.

I'm the one that's working.
Even on a superficial level, yes, you've got a face, you're nice and light, but where's your bum?
That's significant.
Aaron, I told you.
You want a girl to look like she's dying!
Anorexic here, morbidly obese here and here!
OK, well, I'd love to see your wife.
So would I. Slut.
Aaron, aren't you going to do anything?
Men do things, boys do Buddha chants.
Oh, son, you've got to do some legwork.
Look at them chicken legs!

Aaron!
Look, I know it's not going to happen tonight because the atmosphere's a bit tense, but can you guys do the wrestling thing again before you go...
Aaron!

Oh, he knows I'm only playing with him.
You've got to be cruel to be kind to make a man.
Let me know when that man is made.
No, in all honesty, you're probably a lovely girl.
I hope he's taking good care of you.
Thanks.
You look a lot like her, you know.
- Oh, well...

Come on, you've got to be cruel to be kind to make a woman, too.
You haven't even learnt the easiest trick in the book.
Treat 'em mean.
How do you think this is going, Ryan?
- I'm going to come!

I going to come, I'm going to come!
- No...

Aah, aah... !
I did a big come!
My toes have gone all numb.
Oh!

- You're not supposed to...

Oh, great.

There's nothing there.

Well, then again, girls don't always squirt, so the same must be true for boys.
Good work, Ryan!
Do you mind if I take a nap?
- Why?

And also, there's something very exhausting about you.
OK, I guess.
But you have to stay here in my sister's room.
Why are we in your sister's room?
Because I heard that sex sometimes smells, and if there's an odour,
I want my mum to think it's her sex, not mine.
- Anyway, goodnight!

Oh, yes, I read that falling asleep together can create emotional attachment in women, and I have no desire to see you again, so I will sleep in my room.
Aargh!
Tracey!
- Ola?

Ola, are you off your rocket?
- Get me the fuck home.

Save?

Yeah, Ola, he's in a wheelchair!
Not the fucking wheelchair, my fucking clothes!
Ola, get this shit off of me!
I was stressed, he was going to catch us!
He knew.

He has a fantasy thing.
You came along and we saw an opportunity.
I mean, we were texting each other the whole time, since the train journey.
- Well, why didn't you tell me?

OK, I can see you may have found it deceptive.
I can't say I'm offended.
No, it's "I can't say I'm NOT offended."
No, I mean to say, I'm really not offended.
I mean, you know, let's go and discuss this in the cottage.
- Really?

- Really?

Are you going to have sex?
- Yes.

Mm-hm.
Ola's gone and got it...

Oh, fuck.
I thought mixed race people were supposed to be more evolved!
Supposed to be the smart ones!
That is the dumbest thing I've ever seen!
Tracey, can you not see that he's everything
I've been telling Aaron to be from time?
Well, just so you know, he made advances towards me as well, but I rejected him.

Why does everything up always have to be about you?
Oh, OK.
Got caught out, so now you're trying to beef, yeah?
Wash your bum crack, Candice, I can smell the guilt from here!
- Oh, fuck off, man!

- but you need to wash it, bruv!

Yeah, I know.

- What for?

Oh.

It was just some lame dry hump thing.
Oh, sorry, now you will have to tell him.
- Why?

I don't want to lie to Aaron.

Do you know what, I'm just going to break up with him.

Oh, isn't he going to ask why you're breaking up, duh, you dodo head?
Maybe I might just run away, like you.
You've got till 12:24pm tomorrow to tell him or I will.
- Why 12:24?

Just go to bed.
I didn't even need to kick him out.
Aaron.

12:24.
She knows I'm not ain't going to say nothing, she's my best mate.
Oh, son!

Treating you like the shit off me shoe, you're my son!
To be honest, Dad, it's Candice you should be apologising to.
I think we both took advantage of each other.
- Took advantage?

What's the point in talking about it?
What do you mean, he's lying?

What's happened?
She got off with me, didn't she?
Aaron look at me.

- Candice, what's he on about?

He's crazy, he's crazy.

Tracey.

- Tracey!

You fucking prick.
Just going to take five, if that's all right.
Baby!

It was hardly anything.
Things are getting tense in the Big Brother house.
Just in case you're still wondering if I'm interested in you sexually...
- I am.

I like it, it's part of it, you know?
I left my number in there.
I'm sorry.
If you want me to be more like my dad, ask me directly,
- don't get off with him!

And I don't want you to be anything like him.
- I want you to be you.

- What if I want changes?

I want to get married.
Well, we can't just do it now, there's no church.
You know what I mean, when we get back and that.
I'm never talking to him again.
Oh, Ola!
Did you have sex?

I can't even go back in there, I don't know what I'll do to him.
Just grab the bags and ignore him.
- Ignore him!

You're right, I can feel it.
What happened?
Basically, Aaron's dad told me he was in love with me, but I told him I wasn't interested.
I'm sorry, Mummy!
I'm sorry.
I don't deserve you.
- Or anyone.

I didn't take the piss.

I did.
I promise.
Well, fuck yourself, then!
