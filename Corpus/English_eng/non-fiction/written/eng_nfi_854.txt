- You look good.

I've just been worried about you.
Things are going well?
No more rats since they put me on the risperidone.
That's... that's good.

So you're feeling better, then?
Yeah.

Robin, there's something that I have to tell you.
The reason why you're in here...
I asked your father to check in on you.
I had no idea that he would do something like...
It's not your fault.
You couldn't have known he'd do this.
It's not all bad.
Hey, they let me use the shower.
Not without supervision, though.
They are worried about suicide in here, so no shoelaces, no belts.
See the sink?

Evidently, if you wrap your gown around your neck just right, you can use it to strangle yourself.
You don't belong in here.
Not according to the petition Dad filed.
Article 6 of the Mental Health and Disabilities Code.
No.

This is not the solution.
What can I do?
Oh, I really appreciate your being here.
Support from friends and family is crucial for the therapeutic process, so thank you.
Committed against her will?
She can't even shower by herself.
That is some therapeutic process.
I think we all wish this could've happened differently, but, you know, at least she's getting the care that she needs, and she's safe and secure.
No.

In prison.
It's not the same thing.
This place is what is gonna drive her crazy.
She needs to be out of here.
- Good morning, Nat.

Hey, Natalie, have you seen Reese?
No.

I've been meaning to ask, but...
I know... it's a delicate situation.
She's dealing.

Well, if you need anything, just please ask.
- Thanks.

April, today's match day.

Texted him a dozen times.

They're only taking one local student, so that makes me think he didn't get it.
Or maybe he just wants to tell you in person.
No news could be good news, too.
Let's hope.

It means "white butterfly" in Portuguese.
Yeah, that doesn't clear things up.
It's a Brazilian superstition.
So, if the first butterfly you see in the year is white, it's good luck.
I saw one a few weeks ago.
Technically, doesn't that only bring you luck?
Wouldn't Noah need to have seen this white...
Seriously?

Probably an argument I don't win, huh?
Dr. Choi, incoming!
Peds versus auto.

Gary Foster, 32.

GCS 15, vitals stable, 16 gauge in the right AC.
- Loss of consciousness?

Wanted to make sure no one blames the cab driver for what happened.
It was my fault.

I just couldn't stop it.
It's okay, Mr. Foster.

Let's transfer on my count.

Breath sounds clear and present bilaterally.
BP 122/70.

Let's roll him off the board slowly.
Easy.
- Okay, okay, okay.

Okay, Mr. Foster, listen to me close, okay?
- Okay.

Good, good, good.

Good.

All right, April, 50 of fentanyl for the pain.
Let's get X-rays.

I also want a CT head, abdomen, and pelvis, and let's get an EKG.
- This is bad, isn't it?

- Mr. Foster.

It's okay.

Reese, you got a second?
Uh, so, I just saw Robin.
It seems like her therapy's going well.
It is.

Most importantly, she is letting us help her.
I wasn't sure she'd be so trusting, considering how this went down.
So, she tells me that you guys are diagnosing this as schizophreniform.
- Yeah, it's looking like that.

Is that how long you guys are planning on keeping her?
Well, right now, it's all about making sure her psychosis is under control and her meds are dosed appropriately.
Anything about...

Right.

He reminded me that patience is a virtue.
I'm pretty sure that Dr. Charles put those words in his mouth.
Reese, this is all messed up.
I'm sorry, Connor, but I don't know what you want me to say.
If Robin had been committed in Indiana, she'd be released already.
Same with Michigan.

All of those states have shorter holds.
But this is Illinois, and I don't make the laws.
Tell me this couldn't be treated as an outpatient basis.
That's not up to me.
Is she or is she not a danger to herself?
At this exact moment, no, but it's not that simple.
Yes, it is.
Ah, so, what's the word?
I matched my first choice.
- Really?

That's great!

Really?

Knew you could do it.

- Don't worry about Stohl.

Does Natalie know?
Not yet.

Hm.
Keoni?
What did you do?
- No clue.

We're going to Treatment 2.
Doing a DIY reno on a bar.
Been tripping over construction supplies all week.
Must have twisted my ankle.
Didn't notice till it got really bad.
All right, let's take a look.
Hop up there.

These your construction boots?
I'm Hawaiian, brah.

You got a nail in your foot, dude.
You're kidding?
It doesn't hurt?
Been barefoot or in slippers since I could walk.
Calluses so tough I could walk on hot coals and wouldn't even flinch.
Swing your foot up there for me.
Let's get a CBC, a CMP, and a tetanus, and have Danny come down with a portable X-ray machine.
Okay.

Put on some shoes.
And give up the endless summer?

Hey, April.

- What?

Jeff got the Med spot.
Oh.

I'm sure Noah matched somewhere great.
Her stomach's been hurting her for a few days now, but an hour ago, everything just went haywire.
She's been screaming in pain.

- Abdominal pelvic ultrasound.

Okay, Allison, can you tell me exactly where it hurts?
I just got braces put on last week.
See the confusion?
And her eyes...

It's called nystagmus.

- No.

- menstruating?

Is she sexually active?

She's only 13!
Look, I don't think so.

- Ali, baby!

I'm sorry.

Baby, what's happening?
I don't understand.

Not seeing any free fluids, no ovarian abnormalities.
All right, let's do a CBC, CMP, chest X-ray, cultures, head CT, tox screen, blood and urine, and a serum pregnancy.
Wait, pregnancy?

She hasn't even started talking about boys yet.
I understand, but these are standard tests.
We just need to run them to be safe, okay?
Can you just give her something for the pain, please?
I'm sorry, but we can't do that until the tests are finished.
- Baby, what's going on, huh?

We will figure this out, okay?

I can grab you some more pillows if you need them.
If it were only that easy.
Mr. Foster, I got your X-rays and scans.
There are multiple fractures on your left side.
L1 through L4 of your spine, humerus, pelvis, and ribs.
Good news is they won't require surgery.
- They'll heal on their own.

On average, six to eight weeks.
After that, between rehab and physical therapy, likely a year before you're back to full strength.
A year.

Now, there is one more injury.
The head CT revealed a left-sided subdural hematoma and skull fracture.
Our neurosurgeon, Dr. Abrams, wants to schedule surgery immediately.
What happens if I decline?
Mr. Foster, you're bleeding inside your brain.
If the pressure within your skull isn't released, it will get worse.
It's highly likely you'll die.
I'm already dying.
I have ALS.
It's progressing rapidly.
That's why I fell.
By the time my bones heal, the disease will be ravaging me.
Yeah, but you'll be alive.
Barely.

No.

No surgery.
I mean, there shouldn't even be a debate.
We can save Mr. Foster's life.
I understand, April, but unfortunately, that's not the issue.
His hematoma's worsening.
He's gonna bleed to death.

We can't.

It's ironclad.
So, that just makes it okay to do nothing?
April, part of Mr. Foster's directive instructs that upon death, his organs and tissues be donated.
Clearly this isn't a rash decision, so what's the discussion?
That we have to sit by and watch a man die when we can easily extend his life.
- It's wrong.

Transfer the patient to the ICU.
Sharon,
I need a minute.
Yes.
Hey, update me on Allison?
White count's moderately elevated, but her fever's rising, and she's disinhibited with a decreased level of consciousness.
- Drug overdose?

Pregnancy, urinalysis, chest X-ray, CT, pelvic ultrasound.
Neurologic infection?
Meningitis?

Just did.

Whatever this is, it's viral.
The lab's running a PCR.
- Okay.

Hey.

That's awesome.
Way to go, Clarke.

Thanks.

Natalie!
- She's seizing.

- Two of ativan.

Sats are dropping. 77. 76.
Allison, can you feel this?
I need to intubate.
No drugs.

We're gonna fix this.
- Okay, almost.

No, no, no, no, no...

She won't be able to breathe otherwise.
- I'm in.

Secure the tube and start bagging.
Stat chest X-ray and call up to the pediatric ICU for a bed.
Wait, ICU?

Hey, man.

Good news only, please.
Can I sit?
Uh-oh.
Everything's normal except your blood glucose.
It's extremely high.
- Diabetes.

I'm gonna start you on IV fluids and insulin and order hemoglobin A1C,
Get a better reading on your sugar levels.
Diabetes can make your feet numb.
That's why I didn't realize I had a nail in my foot, isn't it?
Yeah.
I've been sick for a while.
Look.

Some lifestyle adjustments, and you'll get way out ahead of this thing.
Yeah, sure.
Look, I get it.

I'm gonna page Endocrinology, have them come down for a consult.
They should be able to answer all your questions.
- Hey.

Encephalitis.
Oh, my God.

Yeah.

Virus fits the symptoms.
Yeah.
I just didn't see it coming.

Herpes?
April!
BP's falling. 94/66.
Heart's racing.

All right, lungs are wet.

Can't get a reading.
Fingers are swollen, purple.

Get a blood gas.
Toes are purple.

Blood in the eyes, nasal passage.
- What's happening?

- Why?

PCO 256, PAO 255.
All right, let's increase the oxygen to 10 liters.
April?
Is he still being transferred to the ICU?
Hold off for now.
Let's test for DIC.
If that's what we're seeing,
I think there may be a way to convince Gary to fix his brain bleed.
Oh, hey, were you looking for me?
Please join us, Dr. Charles.
This is Nicole Jansen of Shipley...
Shipley Austin Shea.
I'm representing the interests of Robin Charles.
Lawyers?
I'm hoping you can provide some clarity on the circumstances surrounding Ms. Charles's involuntary hold.
I don't see how it's not clear.
A petition was filed in accordance with state law.
And within 24 hours, Dr. Kwon here signed...
I will get to Dr. Kwon.

Interesting.
Allison has HSV type 2, which is more commonly associated with genital herpes than oral.
Genital?

Ali doesn't do that.

Yeah, look, I work from home.

Okay, no boys come over, ever.
I know girls don't tell their mothers everything...
God knows I didn't, but...

Have you noticed any change in Allison's mood or personality in the last few days?
No.

Why?
Allison's abdominal pain is inconsistent with the HSE diagnosis, and it may be a sign of sexual assault.
We'd like to perform a more extensive pelvic exam just to be sure.
Is that really necessary?

There might be some internal damaging and bleeding that needs to be repaired, and it is possible she may have contracted another STD.
Look, can it just wait?

It's okay.
It's okay.

- Are you sure?

Um, if this is that,
- I need to kn...

We'll get started right away.
I'll start Robin's discharge paperwork.
Thank you.
Hmm.

I found out just before you did.
I mean, come on.

Is this a joke?

I thought that you guys would at least go to the wall for Robin.
Daniel, if we don't make a deal in this room, the next place we'll meet will be in front of a judge with Robin and a team of doctors that they've assembled to challenge our every move.
That's not good for anyone, especially for you.
Okay, well, then, I appreciate you looking out for me.
Daniel.

- Thank you very much.

Dr. Charles, don't.

Not now, not now.

I'm just curious.

- Yeah.

You work in 36-hour shifts.
Uh-huh, so I'll adjust my schedule and we'll make it work.
But what happens next time she has a psychotic break?
I mean, even if you're home, you're not equipped to deal with it.
Every second that she spends in that ward, her resentment towards you grows.
Can't you see that I'm trying to do you a favor?
- Don't do me any favors!

And you escalated things!
You don't have a clue what you are dealing with.
Is this some kind of game to you where you get to be the hero?
Is that what it is?
No, this is not a game.
You made a mess, and I'm fixing it.
Right.

She is not a little girl anymore.
Okay?

Give it up.
Allison's pelvic exam yielded evidence of vaginal trauma:
perforated hymen, mucosal tears, severe edema, swelling...
All clear evidence of sexual assault.
- Timeline?

Poor baby.
All right, I'll activate the rape protocols and notify PD.
- This case is now a crime.

We'll talk to the parents about what comes next.
- All right.

Mm-hmm.
Where are you going?
Gonna go get some fresh air.
With your clothes over your arm?
I've seen too many people skip out after getting bad news.
It never ends well.
What does it matter if I stay or if I go?
The results are the same.
I doubt that.
- Move.

So, where does that leave us?
I'm scared.
It's okay.
Come on back.
I know someone you should talk to.
- A shrink?

The trauma nurse won't let me be in there with her.
It's protocol, just while they're collecting evidence.
It won't be long, though.
I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee.

No.
Wait, wait.

Can I ask you something, Dr. Manning?
Of course.
Could you be having unprotected sex regularly with someone with herpes and not catch it?
Not even...

Yes.
I don't want to believe it could be true, but the only person who was alone with Ali in the past week was Kevin.
I can't think of anyone else it might've been.
Ms. Nicholson, you can be with your daughter now.
Thank you.
I'm just being paranoid, right?
I suppose I can't talk to the girl for some time, right?
No.

Wouldn't surprise me.

Seriously, Jay, I don't know how you go to work and do this every day.
I could say the same thing for you.
I got to take this.
My feet are cold.
I'll get you some more blankets.
Everything hurts.
It's from Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation, DIC.
Clots are forming inside your vessels, blocking blood flow and depriving you of oxygen.
Your organs are failing.
Unfortunately, in this condition, they're not suitable for transplant.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

No.
There's got to be something you can do.
Mr. Foster, if you allow us to operate on the hematoma, that puts us in a better position to treat the DIC.
No.

I'm laying here with broken bones that won't heal before I'm locked up on life support.
Listen, you can't let my organs die before I do.
Please.
There is a fix for the DIC.
Heparin.

Mr. Foster, heparin is a blood thinner, which means it will also significantly worsen the bleeding in your brain.
Instead of weeks to live, you'll have only hours.
Weeks weren't much, but... that gave me time to say good-byes.
Hours, though.
Mr. Foster, if we're gonna start the heparin...
The sooner, the better.
Yeah.
You don't have to do this.

What would you like to do?
Give me the heparin.
Gary, are you sure?
Yes.
Okay.

April!
- We cannot do this, Ethan.

Because you pressured him, made him feel he had to choose right now.
No.

Don't put this on me.
It is on you.
Your hands may have been tied by his advance directive, but giving him heparin knowing it's lethal, that's assisted suicide.
April, we can't save Gary, but one organ donor can save up to eight lives.
One tissue donor can improve the lives of up to 50 others.
Because of him, 58 people get a second chance.
Put in the order for heparin.
No.
Then I'll do it myself.
This is everything you had when you were admitted.
Thank you.
You can't hold me here any longer.
I know.
Look...
Whatever you have to say,
I don't want to hear it.
I just want you to be safe, Robin.
I'm going to be.
With Connor.
What is up, family?
Matched at Chicago Med!
Emergency Medicine, baby!
Let's get it!

What?

What?

Only one local spot at Med, and it's all mine!
Aah!
I'm home!
I knew you'd do it.

Hey, what's going on?
I matched in Honolulu.
Chicago Med wasn't even on my list.
- Good luck, Clarke.

I just assumed...
I mean, you must have known about this for a while now.
- Yeah.

I don't know.

- Okay.

Sorry, Jeff.

- Let's talk later?

I spoke to the parents together and independently.
- And?

Offenders don't usually behave that way.
Any other leads?
Allison's comprehensive tox screen detected trace amounts of triazolam in her blood.
That's a benzo, right?
Yeah.

The stepdad's an accountant.
I don't see him getting his hands on that.
Unless maybe he was prescribed it.
I mean, it is sometimes used for insomnia.
Yeah, it definitely puts you out.
The hospital uses it mostly to treat patient anxiety, usually before procedures, MRI scans, things like that.
So, she could've gotten it here.
Did you give it to her before the CT scan?
- No.

Another doctor then, maybe.
Did the mom mention any other recent medical issues?
No.

Braces.
Allison did just get her braces on.
Dentists also sometimes use triazolam.
After you pass, you'll immediately be taken into the OR where your organs and tissues will be recovered.
When that happens, will it hurt?
No.
The bleeding in your brain will starve it of oxygen.
You'll lose consciousness, and then you'll shut down.
- I'll be dead.

But your body will still be alive.
But you won't be able to control your breathing.
The organs still need oxygen, though, so we need...
You want to adjust my advance directive.
Just the DNI.
We need your consent to intubate you once you lose consciousness to protect the organs until you get into the OR.
Do we have your permission?
Yes.

Okay.
Right there.
You think I'm making a mistake.
Earlier this year, I suffered a miscarriage.
My child never got a chance at life.
I would give anything just... for one moment.
You may not have as much time as others, but you still have some.
I'm sorry for your loss.
But my time is over.
The only positive is my death can help other people.
I know...
It looks like I'm giving up, but this is everything I've been living for.
This is it.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm ready.
Hanging meds is a nurse's responsibility.
I will do it.
Making a break for it, Keoni?

Seemed like a good idea at the time.
Figured Maggie was sending over a shrink.
Oh, no.

I appreciate the red carpet, but there's nothing you can do.
In the back of my mind, I knew it was diabetes.
I should've never come to the hospital.
Because what?

You don't understand, Sharon.
My family... diabetes kills.
Now it's my turn.
Your genetics don't doom you, Keoni.
No?

I exercise.

I did what I was supposed to do.
Yeah, and unfortunately, people like you and I have to do that and more to break the cycle.
Yes, I have diabetes too.
And I've lost family also.
- I didn't know.

And it's not because I'm hiding it, but because I've got it under control, and I have for the last 14 years.
There are people in this hospital who have to surrender.
You have an opportunity.
You better take it.
It's gonna be okay.
Oh, Dr. Reese?
If, um...
If you would like to continue your residency under a different attending,
I would completely understand.
Hey, Keoni.

Work in progress, but I'll get there.
Heard you're taking off for the sunshine.
Oahu.

A native Hawaiian.

You might be right.
Uh, Ms. Goodwin wanted you to have your nail.
You know what?

He ho'omaka hou 'ana.
"A new beginning."
You and me both.
Yeah, we'll just have to wait.
Ohh, this view.

Or just a view.
So, dinner.
The pantry is... not really stocked.
We could go out.
Or order in.
It's probably for the best.

Look,
I know you went out on a limb, so thank you.
I'm just so happy to be out of there.
Come here.
Doctor?

- What is it?

Breathing trial looks good.
I'm gonna take this tube out, okay, Allison?
All right.
Ready?
It's okay.
Breathe, and there you go.
Okay.
Where am I?
You got sick, honey.
We had to take you to the hospital.
How long am I gonna be here?
I don't want to miss the school dance.
Oh, sweetie.
Hi, baby.
The orthodontist?

When she came out, she smiled, showed me her braces, didn't seem any different.
The police suspect instead of nitrous he used triazolam.
It knocked her out, ensured she had no memory of the assault.
Sick bastard.
I know this is a lot to process, but once Allison is stronger, the detective would like to come in and ask her a few questions.
Look, Ali just had a brush with death, and all she cares about is if she can still go to the junior high dance.
She's so innocent.
I don't want to take that from her.
One day we'll have to, but not today.
We understand.
We'll be back in the morning to check on her.
Good night.
Jeff's locker's cleared out, and he left.
Yeah, about an hour ago.
Did you know?

Yes.

He left without even saying good-bye?
That's not cool.
No.

The conversation about why wouldn't have done either of us any good.
Slips out in the night, and still somehow he makes it chivalrous.
I'm happy for Jeff.
Fresh start.
Yeah.
Dr. Halstead.
Night, Maggie.
Nina and I are gonna meet Jay at Molly's.
- You want to join?

Put this day behind us?
Yeah.

Uh, I just...

Okay.
Gary's organ recovery went well.
A lot of lives are being saved tonight.
Just wish it felt more like a win.
So much for white butterflies.
I think we make our own luck anyway.
I should get back to the ED.
Yeah.

I'll...

So, then the guy says, "If we would've done it my way, we could've walked out of here."
Oh, that's really horrible, Jay.
Who told you that one?
- Dad.

- Come on.

He's disgusting.
Whoa.
Hey.
Wow.
Big change.
Yeah.

- Looks really nice.

Yeah, it looks great.

Thanks.

Well, we all like it.

Oh, I will, um...

Four shots of tequila.

Yes, please.

Babe?
Robin?
No!
Robin, look at me.
Robin.
Aah!

No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no.

Open the door.
Please open the door.
Please open the...

Open the...

Robin, please.

Please!
No, no, no, no, no!
Come on!
