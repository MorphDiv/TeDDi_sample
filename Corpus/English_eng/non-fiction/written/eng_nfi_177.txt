Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school.
Our teacher, Miss Keane, told us that last year.
I think she said it to inspire us.
Didn't half make me think we were wasting our time, though.
No.
Your teacher's not the one who said that.
No?
No.
THEY LAUGH
So, are you looking forward to tomorrow?
I suppose so.
I might be sick.
Right.
Careful.
What you've been doing?
Thank you.
Hi, Hayley.
Well, would you look at that?
It's like opening time at visa section.
Have a nice day.
Benefit scrounger.
Have a nice day.
See you later.
Today, two completely segregated schools start a new life together.
This is Ackley Bridge College, a new school with a new attitude.
Ackley Bridge is one of the most divided communities in the UK.
Whites and Asians live side-by-side but in totally different worlds.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
I know you're confident, but you don't look confident.
You're making me nervous, you.
Cos you know all about public speaking, don't you,
That whole chest thing, really useful.
How are we feeling, Mrs Carter?
Mr Carter.
Mr Bell.
So, do you want to go through your speech?
What if I just want to surprise you?
No, no, definitely no surprises.
And did I say I were late?
Do you mind introducing yourself to fourth gear?
You're not from round here, are you?
Mustn't give pupils intimate details of your own life, sir.
You might get trolled.
And believe me, this town's troll heaven.
Hey!
How have you been?
How's your mum?
How are you?
Just wish I hadn't dropped out last year.
Gonna be in class with my little sister now.
You had a tough time.
I'm glad you came back.
I'd give you a hug, if only the school'd let me in
Cos I'm late and I'm wearing flip-flops!
And I have to let you know how proud I am of this team and all the work we've done so far.
But today, today is our chance to prove ourselves...
I know it's a long shot, but does anyone have a spare pair of shoes?
Today is the day that we prove ourselves to the kids and to the community, both of which are equally important to me and this school, and I think to all of us.
If you haven't introduced yourselves to each other...
Sammy.
What are you doing here?
I'm community liaison.
I'm loving this.
Come here.
Why weren't you hugging me back?
I haven't seen you for years.
I like your shoes.
It's nearly 8:30.
Flights and that, I got stuck.
Me backpacked got nicked.
Getting emergency documents isn't easy, Mand.
Come on.
BELL RINGS
Settle down, please.
Thank you.
LAUGHTER
Right, when I point to yous,
I want you to shout your names loud and proud.
Razia Paracha.
Sit down, please.
His name is Jordan Wilson, and he's a wind-up.
Good morning, students.
Year 11, 12 and 13 assembly in the main hall will commence in ten minutes.
Today is the day when two completely segregated schools,
Stanley Nunn High School and St Jerome Community College...
We will not require improvement.
We will not settle for good.
Together, we can be outstanding.
APPLAUSE
Thank you, Mrs Carter.
Hello, Ackley Bridge.
For those of you who don't know me,
I am the school sponsor, Sadiq Nawaz.
Me and Mrs Carter have worked closely together in the planning of this merger school, and have made an effort to delve deeper into one another's cultures.
Ooh-la-la!
LAUGHTER
Over the summer, Mrs Carter accompanied myself and some other governors on a trip to Pakistan.
Pakistan!
She learned a lot of things.
We hope our friendship can be an example to this school,
What are you smiling for?
BELL RINGS
What do you think you're doing?
That's out of order!
Get him!
He's talking about white girls, too, you know!
SHOUTING
Do you think it's funny?
THEY ALL SHOUT
What were you thinking?
Don't encourage him.
You'll be laughing on the other side of your face when you get in there!
If it were another kid, an Asian kid, would you be letting him back in?
But since when do we give up on kids that easily, eh?
Isn't this a matter for the board?
You know what, a school sponsor doesn't actually get to decide
You don't know the kid, right.
What are you trying to help him out for?
I'm not trying to help him out,
I'm trying to make the school work, like you, and like you.
He thinks we're going to fail.
Let's not give him what he wants.
Send him home for the rest of the day.
Tell him he's on report, reporting to you, mind, Steve.
And I want a meeting tomorrow with Prevent.
Get Mr Qureshi to set that up.
Thanks.
You just can't help yourself, can you?
Come on.
Uhm...
I've got five minutes if you want to talk about anything.
Coming?
Yeah...
Yeah, I'm coming.
If that was one of us, we'd be arrested by now.
So you're suddenly all over it.
I just don't want to start a bloody war about it.
Yes, sir.
Miss me?
Mr Simpson is new.
Try-outs are all on Mr Simpson today, so...
All right, well, before we go up to the pitch, who usually picks teams?
Well, go for it, then.
I really don't think that's a good idea.
Abdullah.
Sweet.
Morning, Miss Carter.
I was doing my rounds.
Do you mind if I observe for a bit?
We're just drafting up a class contract.
Whose wants to share with Miss Carter one of their clauses?
Anywhere?
"imaginative interpretation", stuff that gets you all the way to level ten.
I don't want any books written by white dead men.
With you there, kid, but unfortunately that's 99% of our reading list.
Miss Carter, any thoughts?
I'm sure your syllabus is full of diverse and dynamic texts.
Tell you what, we give 'em a go and if we can't find anything that speaks directly to your lives,
Agreed, Miss Carter?
Answer your phone.
GASPING
The kid's a racist.
Come on, man, loosen up.
I thought it were funny.
Why are you selling bacon crisps?
They sell 'em at the bloody Lidl as well and your mum's always shopping there.
They've not been near a bloody pig.
Do I get free stuff, Mrs Paracha?
Hey, who's the fitty with the braces?
Uhm... that is Alya's twin.
Don't worry, I don't go out with schoolboys.
We like real men, don't we, Nas?
Yeah, Mira will be there.
It'll settle your tummy.
Are you ready to tell me what's going on?
Dad threw me out.
Said it wasn't working.
Chose Eve over me, Mum.
From Peckham?
You... you know, uhm...
Yeah.
There's literally no room for me there.
My room's gonna be a nursery.
I'll sort it.
Call your dad, we'll get you back down to London.
I'll be back in a minute.
Have you got a problem with my work?
I think you've got issues with authority.
Power's gone to your head.
You're talking about throwing the classics in the bin!
It's day one, get their attention.
Oh, but you'd know that, if you'd been to the inset day.
She can't stay here in that state.
Hiya.
Seriously, what's so good about in here?
You've got a coffee machine, which is impressive and everything, but it's still school.
I'm your age, don't worry.
You've just all got to be dead to me cos you passed exams and that.
It weren't her fault.
She's in our year, really, she's just got to retake.
Teachers will be well pleased to see me talking to you all.
You're real nice, you.
Ta for the support
Nas, drop the kanjari.
If you wanna play with your gori mate, we're not stopping you.
Emma?
There's a bunch of us going for a meal later at the pub if you fancy it?
I'll be on chunder alert.
Come later if she crashes out.
Might do.
See you.
This budget stuff with Sadiq.
There's a few of them going for a bite to eat though.
I'll be back soon as I can.
Stop kissing the boss.
Oh.
Oh.
It's your dad!
Then let him ring,
Chloe's here, in bits cos of you.
Of course she's upset!
So, you attack her?
She came over, all hands over me, so I just... pushed her off.
Unbelievable.
Stay out my sight, Chloe.
You lied to me before
And now you expect me to stay in and nurse you through your hangover?
Forget it, Chloe.
I'm gonna go home, then.
I'll book an Uber... again.
Don't even try it.
I'll do what I want!
SHOWER RUNS, MUSIC PLAYS
EMMA SINGS
Out.
Oh, my God.
How was school with all that new lot, then?
Oh, Jordan Wilson insulted half of the school.
Jordan?
That, that's not Muslim, is it?
It's Mum.
You'll have to chuck that duvet.
Dunno where she's been or what she's been using.
Where you going?
Got to see if all my stuff's still there.
Where am I?
Your home, Mum.
My Missy.
Best girl.
Dinner's getting cold down here.
What's her problem?
I'm clean.
Next door, then?
LAUGHTER
Oh, I love that joke.
Hey, Steve did you go to Pakistan in summer?
No, no, Mandy, she wouldn't let me.
But she went with governors and that, so can understand it.
Can't believe you let him take her away with no supervision.
Supervision!
Hey, just saying.
Someone told me Sadiq runs a mattress company cos he's "bedded" half the women in the valley.
Oh, Okay.
Anyone for pudding?
Nana, I've got to sing Valerie.
How am I gonna know if I won owt, now?
I've got to do it for my assembly.
Valerie by Amy Winehouse
♪ Well, sometimes I go out by myself ♪
♪ And I look across the water... ♪
Out the back.
♪ Since I've come on home well, my body's been a mess ♪
♪ I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress ♪
♪ Won't you come on over ♪
♪ Stop making a fool out of me ♪
You know you have to stop.
They're too young to be dealing with all this.
All what?
It's good job there isn't man in this house.
You know, they wouldn't allow you through, the state that you're in.
Oh, my God, have you seen this!
Don't show people that.
I'm sure SHE didn't put it up!
What's she doing with a photo like that?
Why don't you just tone it down a bit?
That way, you know, she won't have anything to moan about.
Armley Prison?
Where did you think I'd gone?
To Burnley, to work for your uncle.
Yeah, I went to Burnley to work for my uncle.
Come on, I thought your were smart.
You've seen my kid.
I was just really young.
It didn't take you long to get over me, then, did it?
I heard you had to find Allah to get over me.
Oh, you heard that, did you?
Anyway, thanks for the lift.
It's all right.
Night.
I could have had an extra hour in bed.
All right, what do you want me to do, drive home drunk?
I was being responsible.
You don't sound that responsible, you was out all night drinking, in school.
You was out all night drinking with...
Sadiq.
You worry too much.
Mum, please don't make me go in.
Because you put your thermometer next to your cup of tea.
BOY WOLF WHISTLES
Ignore him.
Do you have to work today?
Pull a sickie.
Let's do something, me and you.
I can't just sack off work.
But you can't stay at home watching telly, Chloe.
So, why don't you get comfy... and why don't you lose yourself out on the windy moors?
I'll be back, at break.
THEY LAUGH
She's gonna get in trouble, I told you...
Morning.
Right, now, we're gonna find out what lies underneath it all.
In your seats, come on!
Miss Keane.
Do you always post your holiday photos online?
Do you leave your phone out in class?
My bloody daughter!
I've had parents ringing me, I've even had staff coming in here.
MANDY SIGHS
I mean, I already had to talk about Jordan Wilson, now this.
EMMA GROANS
What are you playing at?
What do you think you've done?
Trying to get me sacked?
You're not sacked, are you?
What were you feeling, Jordan?
Now, we heard... that you talked about being a revert.
Are you interested in Islam?
You joking?
You previously went to a predominantly white...
No, no-one's saying anything like that.
What were you thinking anyway?
I didn't mean owt by it, I were just trying to make a point.
He doesn't mean that.
No, it were about Muslims, wunnit?
Trying to get them before they got us.
Is that what you really think, Jordan?
That's what counts, innit?
So go on, write it down.
"Jordan Wilson's a racist."
That's exactly what I'll be.
It were a joke!
I'm not saying she's a bad person or anything.
Oh, good, cos she's not.
Come on, Nas, though, the way she dresses, the way she talks...
The way she talks to boys and that.
It's embarrassing, she embarrasses herself.
Yeah, I mean, don't make this some race or Islam thing or anything.
Who would want to hang out with someone like that?
Genuinely, would you?
Nasreen.
Who let her in school?
Last night?
Nas...
Nas, love.
Simone, get off!
Mum?
Lend us a fiver, will you, love?
Sharabi.
What a kanjari.
Imagine having a mum like that.
Because he has been dealt with, so sit yourself down, eh?
Oh, my God, Zain, just get over yourself.
Everyone is trying to get on with...
That's not even cool, that, just after I've stuck up for you an' all.
You're not a Muslim, take it off.
Anyone leaves this classroom, you are all on report.
CLAMOUR AND SHOUTING
What the hell are you doing?
The poor girl is mortified, Steve, what were you thinking?
You said you would take care of this kid.
And I will, Mandy, can you not see that I'm dealing with it?
Here and everywhere else, it seems.
HE SIGHS
What has that got to do with you?
Unless you're impressed.
Look, without Sadiq, we wouldn't have this school.
Yeah, let's all be grateful to Sadiq, because you have certainly been showing him how grateful you are.
Right, yeah.
Cos I'm the one that messes about.
Hello, Ackley!
Hello, Ackley!
What do we all think of Ackley Bridge College then?
Are we gonna roll over?
Get to class!
They think they can keep us quiet with a lick of paint and some crap about learning to live together.
We all know that Ackley Bridge is nothing but a left-for-dead town with foodbanks, smackheads and pram faces.
What you all looking at?
It doesn't matter if you're white or Asian.
There's no jobs for us, we're all going nowhere.
If you're white, you're racist.
And if you're Asian, you don't belong.
BELL RINGS
Nasreen!
What, you just going to stand there and not say owt?
While them lot call her every name going.
Treated her like she was scum.
Go on, Missy, smack her!
Two days in this school and you're so worried what the girls in hijabs think of ya.
Look, Missy, they're me mates.
You don't know them, like I don't know your mates.
It's not my fault you got held back a year, is it?
Oh-ho!
Missy, what are you doing?
Oh, like you don't know how to fight back?
You're such a good little Muslim, you fit right in with that lot.
You were out drinking with me in town not two nights ago.
With the "kutti", with the "gori."
NASREEN SCREAMS
Yeah, come on, Missy!
Fight, fight, fight!
CHANTING ECHOES
STOP!
STOP!
What you expect, me to hit her or summat?
You don't attack her in the quad.
Calm yourself down.
You don't get many good ones in life.
Go on, take her home, go on.
Please, not you as well!
If it's not Missy, it's Alya telling me to be like this, not be like that. "Why you acting like that then?"
"No, don't do that..." It's just, this school is not what I'd expected!
And I don't want the teacher phoning me again.
SHE GROANS
I am not having that boy ruin this place before we've even got going.
I know something's going on.
I've seen the way he looks at you.
"Why it is important to respect other people's beliefs and cultures?"
At least two pages.
And we're gonna stay here until I say we're done.
I'll make tea.
What?
Dad's on his way up from London to take you home.
I thought we can sit down and have a chat about what's really going on, with you.
If you want to.
I thought you hated me.
I can't tell if you're joking.
You can't tell if I'm joking?
That's probs because I am so used to you being cruel to me.
Dad threw me out, you abandoned me last night...
But I think it's fair to say you got me back for that.
Can't wait for half-term though.
We'll go away, I'll book a surprise.
And then I'll take loads of really embarrassing photos of you.
Time's up, Jordan.
If you put half as much effort into your GCSEs, you're gonna be laughing.
HE LAUGHS
Oh, do you reckon?
Do you reckon I could get into art school with that, sir?
Do you reckon there's a whole world waiting for me, sir?
You know, I've looked bad enough trying to stick up for you today.
Were you sticking up for me, sir?
If you're gonna have a fall out with your missus, sir, don't do it where I can hear you.
I've had enough.
I've had enough of you,
You do not lay your hands on a teacher, lad... ever.
No wonder your missus bosses you about, sir.
Especially when she's banging Sadiq Nawaz behind your back.
Jordan...
Jordan, just, just, just listen to me for a sec...
DOOR SLAMS
HE SIGHS
Sorry about before.
She hadn't told me the whole truth exactly.
What are you doing?
What's all this in the car?
What's my stuff doing in the car?
Not just now.
Yeah, Eve says...
So it WAS an accident?
But she's says she can't be in the house with Chloe.
Course I do.
Thought you weren't coming.
Course I am, you're Missy Booth!
I just thought we could hang out.
Just hang out?
Sure.
I didn't call you for that.
I'm not judging ya.
Come here.
You know Nasreen?
Girl you were fighting?
Yeah, I know her.
She's not all that, you know.
Thinks she's way better than me.
Everyone at that new school thinks they're way better than me.
I'm just scum.
So sleep with her for me.
What?
