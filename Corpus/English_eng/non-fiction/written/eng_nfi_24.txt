{\pos(192,210)}These last few weeks have been perfect.
Except for me being pregnant with another man's baby.
And me living with the father of the baby.
I have a lousy short-term memory.
I'd really like to kiss you.
You've been so cool and accepting about all this.
{\* I mean, }I once had a guy break up with me because I had a bad cough.
{\* Well, }You're just so great and beautiful.
I was married, and you were with James.
And now I'm divorced, and you're pregnant.
We just got so lucky.
Check it out, Zack.
It's the mother of your baby making out with another dude.
{\* Okay, }We'll just hang out in my room.
You two get back to{\* , uh, } second base, it looked like.
Things are going so well with Brian,
{\pos(192,210)}and Zack seems totally cool with it.
{\pos(192,210)}Finally, the stars are aligned in my favor.
{\pos(192,210)}I don't know what the stars had against me before,
{\pos(192,210)}{\* but }They{\* 've now }dropped their previous grievances and are now twinkling their approval.
Like you should be, Abby.
I am not proud of you, so stop fishing for it.
{\pos(192,210)}I think you're back to {\* your }same old ways, rushing into something
{\pos(192,230)}you ended up unintentionally pregnant.
{\* And }That's because she's industrious.
{\pos(192,230)}{\* A }Lot of women sleep with {\* a }guy
{\pos(192,230)}and end up with nothing more than a prescription for antibiotics.
{\pos(192,230)}Now, this one... she gets a baby.
Bravo, Billie, bravo!
{\pos(192,230)}Exhibit a: supportive friend.
{\pos(192,230)}Exhibit b: unsupportive sister, whose bra is showing.
{\pos(192,210)}And I am supportive of you, just not of all your choices.
{\pos(192,170)}How can you be sure about Brian after only dating him for three weeks?
Michelle Obama.
{\pos(192,210)}Yes, we know, you love Michelle Obama.
{\pos(192,210)}She makes good choices and has fabulous arms.
{\pos(192,210)}But what you didn't know was, while I was with James,
Brian was off to the side.
{\pos(192,210)}Married, unavailable,
{\pos(192,210)}flirtatious, watching me.
{\pos(192,210)}Which brings me back to what I said before about the stars.
{\pos(192,210)}I think we just need to get on board with the stars.
Absolutely.
{\pos(192,210)}You're just a suck-up, and I see right through that.
{\pos(192,210)}There's something about this Brian I don't like.
{\pos(192,210)}{\* And }I got a sense for these things.
{\pos(192,210)}and she'd be, like, "Kevin's so great, Kevin's so special."
{\pos(192,210)}And then Kevin would be on the news that night next to a table full of guns.
I'm with you, man.
When I saw that guy kissing our pregnant lady... i got this really sick feeling in my stomach.
Kind of like the time I saw my mom skinny-dipping with my uncle Bob.
You got to do something about him.{\* , man.} He's not {\* just }dating Billie, he's dating your baby.
I mean, that great dinner that he bought her...
I'm freaking out, okay, what should I do?
If this guy's angling his way into my baby's life, then
Park bench.
Semi-old people love brunch!
So, I wanted us to have brunch because I don't {\*really }know you, Brian, and I'd like to.
That is just so cool.
Can you believe how cool this guy is?
I got a cool baby cooking' in here.
So, {\* anyway, }Brian, let's get to know each other.
I'll start.
I'm 22, I'm an aspiring chef... and... my childhood dream was to fight Jet Li.
{\* And }I'm still gonna make that happen.
Well, Let's see.
My childhood dream was to be a photojournalist, so I became a photojournalist.
In fact, There's a retrospective of my work at the paper.
That is gonna be so great.
Yeah, how lovely.
You know, I will answer that question in just a second.
Let me just take this.
What are you doing?
I have been dating since...
Oh, my god, since you were in kindergarten, okay?
Sorry.
{\* Uh, so, }You're asking me inappropriate questions about my painful divorce.
{\* Speaking of which, }Remember that crib we saw in the window?
{\* Oh, my god, }That was the most beautiful crib I've ever seen.
When they deliver it, maybe you could put it together{\* , Zack}.
Oh, I'm putting it together.
This is great.
Would you excuse me for a second?
That is so sweet!
You're like Santa Claus but cuter.
Dude, I'm on the floor, handing out cups of crab.
They're finally letting me interact with the customers!
And that's inappropriate, right?
{\* Oh, man, }You were right about that guy.
He's trying to steal your baby.
Like a reverse stork.
We need to calmly discuss this over nine beers.
I'm running out of crab cups, and I got a fat guy circling my kiosk.
What's {\* the }matter, junior?
Mom forget to sign {\* your }permission slip to go to the zoo?
She looks happy with Brian, and I hate it.
{\* Kind of }Reminds me of when you burst on the scene.
{\* Well, }Now I know how you felt.
Except that when I met you, she wasn't pregnant with your baby.
So, it's kind of worse for me.
Oh, I don't know.
I was with her for three years, I put a lot of time in with her.
{\* I think }It's {\* kind of }worse for me.
I have to listen to her make out with Brian in the other room.
You win.
You want to get drunk?
{\* You know, }I don't understand why you can't just fire Brian.
I mean, you run the paper.
Would that I could, man, but he's one of the best photojournalists around, and pictures matter.
If there's one thing I learned after two decades in print media.
People don't like words.
I'm the daddy, i'm supposed to get the crib.
{\* Yo, }A man encroaching on another man's crib buying, is just emasculating.
What's he gonna buy you next, a boob job?
I once had a pregnancy scare.
Dated this stewardess, she told me she was on the pill.
Tommy Lee?
{\* Dude, }That's the greatest thing I've ever heard.
{\* And }You're buying us all these drinks.
I feel so bad about every mean thing I've said about you.
{\* Yeah, }Me too, man.
I mean, we were talking trash about you for the last two months.
I don't find that funny.
You will.
You sure you don't want to watch the end of the movie?
How are you gonna know how it ends?
It ends with me on top of you.
Somebody say douche?
I still can't believe that crib-buying bastard.
I'm mad at him.
I'm mad at him on your behalf and I want to do something with this anger.
Something dangerous... and fun... and fun!
Wish I'd done something more when I lost Billie.
{\* But }What did I do?
I drowned my sorrows in Kate Moss.
Yeah, but what can I do, you know?
{\* I don't know, but }You'd {\* better }do something to stop this now, or you're never gonna get rid of him.
James is right.
That's why he's the father of Tommy Lee's baby, and you hand out crab samples.
Crabs.
Here's his car, guys!
Guys, hang on, i'm starting to get that "i shouldn't be doing this" feeling, like that time I ate 30 eggs.
Perfect, it's unlocked!
Too much tongue?
No, that sounds like my car alarm.
I want to eat your legs.
Make it look like one's driving.
Your baby daddy is attacking my car with seafood.
Zack, stop that!
Stop that right now!
Look, that one's driving!
So, Zack and his friends got drunk,
{\pos(192,210)}broke into Brian's car, filled it with crabs,
{\pos(192,210)}and then crept in here after you went to sleep.
{\pos(192,210)}The stars are not really aligned the way you thought they were.
You know, Michelle Obama doesn't like self-righteous people.
That's actually true.
Is it noon already?
I'm gonna go wake his ass up.
Wake up!
Thanks for letting us crash here.
Is there coffee?
And eggs and bagels.
That was unnecessary.
Hello, lady.
Gotta get to work now.
Good morning.
I'll get you boys some coffee.
There's your penis.
I can explain.
Really?
Crabs?
We talked about it.
I couldn't figure it out at first, but then it hit me.
It's more than {\*just about }the crib thing.
Then what is it?
What do you want?
I want you to break up with this guy.
And then what?
You get to go out with all your friends and meet hot chicks, while I stay at home and watch tv?
There are some good shows on.
Look, I know it doesn't look like it, but I'm doing all this because I care about you.
I know you do.
But there has to be a universe where I get to be happy, too.
Please, be happy with me.
All right.
Don't want to get in the way of your happiness.
So, how did the car cleanup go?
That's how I want every date to end.
With a fishy smell and a crab stuck in my cd changer.
I'm so sorry.
Somebody got me flowers.
Pam, your ex-wife Pam?
That's an oddly thoughtful thing for an ex-wife to do.
Well, here's the thing.
No, not a thing.
Pam is actually going to be here tonight at the photo exhibit.
You mean in spirit?
Look, it's a retrospective of my work;
I still want you here.
Well, my first instinct was no, but then I thought about the crab thing and how you're still talking to me.
So you'll come?
And I have a dress I've been saving for an incredibly awkward situation.
So I think I'll just break that sucker out.
Time for me to meet my new boyfriend's ex-wife.
My life just gets weirder and weirder.
Your life's fantastic.
My life just gets weirder and weirder.
This morning I woke up next to a clown.
{\Okay, }I'm {\just }going to peek around the corner and see what Brian's ex looks like.
Okay, she is extremely pretty.
And she saw me.
You're gorgeous.
Remember, she's the visitor on this date.
She should be peeking around the corner at you.
Thank you for coming.
This is Pam.
It's great to have a chance to meet you.
Brian's told me how supportive you've been of his photography, and why wouldn't you be?
He used to call me his muse.
Didn't you?
Old times.
The photos are really beautiful.
And I gotta say i'm so impressed, and...
I did not realize that Pam is in almost every single one.
You are very photogenic.
Thank you.
So, Brian tells me that you're pregnant with another man's baby.
Yep, it'sgreat.
You gotta try it sometime.
I gotta go wet my whistle.
Oh, my god, "wet my whistle"?
Who was talking just now, Humphrey Bogart?
Okay, and was it my imagination or was Pam, like, super-clingy?
I was clingy once.
Didn't work out well for me.
It won't work out well for Pam.
Lovely photos.
Barren landscapes.
Tell me, did you use an f-stop when you...
Oh, my god, Billie, i'm so sorry about Pam.
She's having a hard time letting go.
You{\ guys }don't seem like you're at each other's throats like other divorced couples.
Well, it's, it's not like we didn't get along or didn't like each other.
Really?
That makes me feel so much better.
She didn't want to have kids.
Which is what I love about you.
Because if things work out between us, it's like an instant family.
I'm an automatic dad.
That's very sweet, but my situation's a little more complicated than that.
I kind of have to.
And I think that... your situation is a lot more complicated than you realized.
Maybe we just moved too quickly.
I so want things to work out between us.
Me, too.
I think that might be best.
My love life is more depressing than a war-torn soviet state.
Brian and I broke up.
I'm sorry, are you all right?
I mean, it was just crazy to think that anyone would just... sign off on this rinky-dink operation I got going on here.
That's not true.
I got you and I got your baloney-head friends.
What else?
Well, you got that little guy in there.
Or... or girl.
You know what else you got?
A buttload of fresh crab.
Good.
Because we put the crabs on your credit card.
This crab is divine.
I insist that all your future pranks involve some form of... crustacean.
Katherine Heigl got a new apartment, {\*but then }when she got there there was a mixup, and Matthew McConaughey had moved in already.
But, really, he moved into her heart.
Just like you all have moved into mine.
We've been watching it for 45 minutes.
I thought it was just a really informative trailer.
I've been saying to myself over and over "they're {\*really }giving the whole movie away."
Yeah, this is better than having a boyfriend.
