Listen!
If we don't nail this number by Friday, my party's gonna be ruined!
I got this, I promise.
I'll get it.
I prom...

Let's take five.
I'm getting old.
Please.

What for?
Ahh.
Well, for anything.
Just put me in jail, man, straight up.
I can't put up with this, Frank.
I almost got a heart attack, homey.
That Sniper's little girl?
Yeah.

You know, my brother's up in Chino, so I said I'd take care of the quinceñera for her.
I knew I'd have to do this father/daughter dance thing, right, but I just didn't count on Lulu being such a big fan of Dirty Dancing.
You're doing right by her, Moreno.
I hope so.
She's been through a lot.
You know me, I got jumped in when I was 12.
But her... she's a good girl.
I just want her to have a shot at something better, that's all.
So... why'd you call us?
I got a hot tip for you.
Some top-shelf heroin just hit the street.
Echo Park Deuces... they slinging it out of that pad that they got over there on 16th.
Where's the dope coming from?
Nobody knows, man.

So the Echo Park Deuces are your new competition, and you want us to take 'em out for you.
- That about it?

Would I be a good informant if I was out of business?
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we just consider this
Lulu's quinceñera present, huh?
Your choice...
Life up in Chino or death right now.
Chino it is.
Good choice.
Gun!

What the hell?
- Who is he?

No tattoos, no track marks.
No fingerprints.
Looks like he burned them off with acid.
So we got nothing to go on.
Well, I didn't say that.

A Beretta 92D issued to a Border Patrol Agent Stevens.
This was Stevens' duty weapon.
Where's Stevens now?
Agent Stevens is dead.
He was murdered this morning, along with his partner.
Special Agent Boudreau, as I live and breathe.
Mmm.

Did we step on your toes again?

You told me you had a working relationship.
I told you we'd worked together.
Actually, we did all the work.
He gave the press conference.
Well, that sounds like the FBI to me.
Jack Ivers, Homeland Security.
These images were taken this morning by one of our drones.
Ocotillo Wells, 190 miles south of here, just this side of the border.
- Looks like a massacre.

Two dead border agents...

One dead coyote.
The rest were just huddled masses yearning to breathe free.
Well, whatever went down, looks like our scarred suicide was part of it.
That's how he acquired Stevens' duty weapon.
Two weeks ago, our scarred man and another subject flew into Mexico City from Kabul, Afghanistan.
He's Afghan?
His name is Farokh.
The scars are from a Hellfire missile strike.
Drone attack.
Now, both Farokh and his travel companion Sadiq are members of a radical sect run by Elder Mudarris.
We've been keeping tabs on Mudarris and his associates.
Mudarris is responsible for bombings in Bagram,
Kandahar, a school in Jalalabad.
More recently, a cafe in Paris, a cruise ship in Belgium.
Mudarris is branching out.

All the way to L.A.
Farokh and Sadiq crossed the border last night, most likely posing as Central Americans.
The border agents were just an unforeseen complication.
Once they killed them, the others became loose ends.
Well, I only see one set of tire tracks leading away from the crime scene.
We believe they took the border agents' 2015 Explorer, along with their weapons.
Vehicle have a tracker on it?
Yeah, it did.

Tradecraft.
So where's this other guy, Farokh's field-trip buddy?
- Sadiq.

Now, I believe that Farokh killed himself in order to prevent us from extracting information from him.
About whatever they're planning, which means they didn't just come here to get rich selling heroin.
No.

Now this next photograph was taken from a security camera at the Mexico City Airport.
Fall back!
Hurry up!
Aah!
Kyle!
Incoming!
Now, listen up.

I don't give press conferences.
I take the Sadiqs of the world outside the boundaries of international law, where I make them tell me things.
Personally, I don't care who catches him.
I got plenty of drones.
What I need now are trackers.
I need people who know how to hunt these streets.
Whatever Sadiq's mission is,
I need you to catch the son of a bitch before he carries it out.
Hey, can I have a veggie egg-white scramble, please?
How's the food here?
Pretty decent.
Great cheeseburgers.
But I'm being good today, and I ordered an egg-white scramble.
Let me guess.

Lab assistant.
My university credits didn't carry over when I came here.
Mmm.
I always dreamed of becoming a doctor, back in Kabul.
My husband was there.
With the Marines.
Thank you.
Maybe I'll see you around the hospital sometime.
Of course.
And please...
Thank your husband for his service.

Good night, Sweet Prince.
Still got it after four beers, Sherman.
You ready to head back?
Sherman Lee Tucker got him a girl waiting?
Aftermarket breasts.
One of those barb-wire tattoos around her bicep.
Sounds promising.
I met her at church.
Here you go.
Thanks, man.
What's on your mind, Corporal?
Fed showed up at my work this morning.
Handed us a photo of a suspected terrorist.
Guy named Sadiq.
He Arab?
Afghan.
That desert crap basket is the gift that keeps on giving, isn't it?
I think I recognize him from Zamindawar.
Yeah, I went through that for a while, man.
Almost knifed some poor guy working the register at a gas station once.
Lucky for me, he had a sense of humor about it, but...
I'm serious.
I think it's him, Sherman.
I think it's that kid.
What are you doing here?
Everyone was supposed to be evacuated.
Knock it off!
I asked you a question!

Home.
My home.
You can't stay here, kid.
No!

It's not safe!

No!
Sherman, come on, man!
No, I can't feel my legs, man!
I'm here, buddy.

That night was the last I saw of him, until that photo.
Now he's some Islamic Radical.
Killed two border cops down south, and I'm pretty sure he's here in L.A.
And I can't help but think maybe he's come here for me.
That's your guilt talking, all right.
You have nothing to feel guilty about, all right.
You saved my life.

All right, you saw him for, what, five seconds?
We hunted these guys for years.
You know how they think better than anyone I know.
I'm just trying to see through Sadiq's eyes.
Of all the gin joints in all the world, this 15-year-old Haji grows up to be Ricardo Montalban in Star Trek II, comes to the City of Angels to take his revenge on Corporal Kyle Craig?
Something like that.
Okay.
Then the first thing I'd be asking, bro, is how's he find you in the first place?
Right?

But if he is here for you, then that means he's got somebody stateside helping him look.
Somebody smart.
He'd need a place to hide out, till he was ready.
And one way or another, he'd need money.
Allahu akbar.
Allahu akbar.
Welcome to L.A., Brother Sadiq.
Kyle!
What is wrong with you?

Listen to me, Alyse.
We need to get you out of the house.
What?

Kyle, it's us!

You all right?
Yeah.
- Alyse.

Alyse, this is Tommy and Rebecca.
- Pleasure.

Thanks.
I really appreciate this.
Of course.

You're gonna stay with Holly a while until this is over.
Until what is over?
Why don't you tell me what's going on, Kyle?
We have never kept secrets from each other.
That is not who we are.
Just trust me, please.
Be safe.
You're gonna think I'm nuts.
Try me.
The bearded guy in the photo.
I think I recognize him from Zamindawar.
I told you about what happened to my buddy Sherman after he got shot?
I followed the Haji who shot him into a house.
I was so full of rage,
I unloaded a full mag in that house.
Alyse doesn't know about it, and I'd like to keep it that way.
You think Sadiq's the guy that shot Sherman?
No.

But there was collateral damage.
One survivor... a kid, 15, 16.
We were told everyone was evacuated.
Somehow, these people weren't.
I saw that photo, and I can't shake the idea that it's him.
It's crazy, right?
Little bit.

But if your gut's telling you this is the same guy, then we go with your gut.
How do you do it?
Do what?
Be okay not knowing what Frank is doing?
Oh, well... there's a lot about me that Frank doesn't know.
Like how I lost my virginity.
My deep love for Taylor Swift.
And he's never seen me in the bathroom.
Ever.
Holly, I'm serious.
You don't have secrets from Kyle?
None that could get me killed.
Yeah, I'm probably not the right person to ask about this.
But you love Frank.
Yes, I do.
But love isn't a free pass.
Frank is who he is, and I am who I am.
I'm afraid I don't even know who Kyle is anymore.
Well, then that would scare me, too.
If it is Sadiq, he would need logistical support.
People already here in L.A.
Base of operations, supplies, cash...
Cash.
We stopped Farokh in the middle of his dope deal.
The money never changed hands.
But Moreno said some of the heroin already hit the street.
Meaning there's gotta be more of it out there somewhere.
Hey, lemme hit you back, homey.

Shut up and listen.
That heroin you tipped us about, how'd you find out about it in the first place?
Some junkie, man.

I need to talk to him.
Well, you'd better get yourself a Ouija board then, man.
That homeboy OD'd.
Man, I told you, Frank, this is some next-level street stuff right here.
It comes from straight out of Afghanistan.
Last time we talked, you said you didn't know
- where it came from.

Moreno, Listen to me.
These people aren't who you think they are.
They're terrorists.
Frank, Frank, relax, relax.
They're not terrorists, man.
They're not even Arabs.
They look like hipsters or something, like they work in a used record store.
I'm looking at 'em right now.
Moreno, get out of there!
Get out of there now!
Moren...
Everything okay?
Yeah.

It's all there.
Moreno!
Frank!

Is that you, Frank?
I'm here.

Oy.
Promise... promise you'll take care of Lulu for me.
You have my word.
You gotta take care of her for me, Frank.
Her... her father/daughter dance is coming up soon.
You die on me, I'll kick your ass, you big, dumb bastard.
He's not dying.
What?
They shot him in the love handle, through and through.
He just got some 9mm liposuction.
Well, he's going to the hospital anyway.
Whoa, whoa!

Hold on!

I got...

Watch.

That's the license plate.
Son of a bitch.
Plate comes back registered to an Alec Wellsley.
Software engineer.
He and his wife Kat are big in the activist scene.
They were anarchists.
Social media says they met at the WTO protests in '09.
Bet they take a knee for the National Anthem, too.
Border agents' SUV just surfaced.
- Where?

About a half-mile from the Wellsley house.
I'll put our surveillance team on the house.
You want to burn the location, spook 'em so they go to ground?
By all means, send in a bunch of Mitt Romney impersonators to Atwater Village.
I'm sure they'll fit right in.
Sadiq is a pro, trained in counter-surveillance.
He'll see your men coming a mile off.
- He's right.

Watch each other's back.
I just got a hit on Wellsley's credit card.
Filled up at a gas station in Burbank.
What's in Burbank?
Across the street from the gas station.
Red, White and Guns.
Yeah, I don't know.

Look, it's up to you.

Afternoon.
Mark me, couple of thugs are gonna kick down his door one night, wanna take away his valuables and maybe even a piece of his old lady, he's gonna wish he'd filled out that damn form
and swiped his credit card, you know?
Amen to that, brother.
Don't take offense, young man.

Heritage, not hate, you feel me?
Oh, yeah, I feel you.
Bill Marks.
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
Running a special today on shotgun ammo.
A young couple came in here probably in the last hour.
We get a lot of couples in here.
Couple that slays together stays together, am I right?
People have a right to arm themselves.
Some of us have even fought for that right.
Semper Fi.
The eagle's facing the wrong way!
You're no Marine.

I had friends who died doing it for real!
Relax, man, it's just a sales tool.
You know what?

Call it the Persuader.
This loaded?
Of course it's not loaded.
Now it is.
Not smart.
This couple we're asking about, we know they were in here, we know they paid with cash.
No waiting period, no background check, and no record of the sale.
Last time I checked, this was still America, damn it.
Which means I don't have to tell you squat.
Normally that'd be true.
But what we have here is exigent circumstances.
An emergency situation requiring swift action to prevent an immediate danger to human life.
Very good, trainee.
What the hell are you talking about?
You sold weapons to terrorists, two home-grown jihadis.
That's treason, my man.
They still hang people for that?
They ought to.
Now, what's about to happen to you is what we call an accidental discharge.
You were running a special on shotgun ammo.
Some chucklehead must've chambered a round into this weapon when your back was turned.
Yee-haw.
Now, what did you sell those people?
Put the shotgun down, Rourke.
I asked him a question.

Yeah, so would I.
Half a dozen 9 mil pistols, three AR-15s and an FN 5-7.
Small arms.
Which would make quite a date night.
Still seems a little light to me.
This couple had at least 100 grand.
Rourke!
He's doing fine.
Who are you?
Homeland Security.
This is pattycake, pal.
I make one call, you're on a C-130 to Romania.
Place makes Abu Ghraib look like Club Med.
And they are way past dog collars in Romania, buddy.
Look, I...

How was I supposed to know they were jihadists?
They just bought the guns, as much ammo as they could carry.
What about explosives, ordnance?
Three cluster bombs.
What?
God help us.
You didn't see the harm, huh?

This isn't police work anymore.
This is a war.
What do you do with cluster bombs?
They're air-dropped munitions, so they're useless without a plane.
Have we checked flight schools?
My people are combing through every flight school within 300 miles...

We're out of time.
We need to concentrate on potential targets and work backwards from there.
- Where are we?

What about sporting events?
Lakers, Clips, Kings, Ducks?
Clippers and Kings are on the road.
Lakers don't play till Sunday.
Well, the Convention Center's hosting an electronics conference tomorrow.
I actually have an invite.
To the electronics show?
They're trying to sell us on surveillance drones, military grade, not even on the market yet.
Drones...
Kyle?
A cluster bomb is a bunch of smaller explosives loaded together, but they can be dismantled.
Yeah.

Exactly.

They couldn't get their hands on a plane, but a drone...
It's the drones.
That's why Sadiq was sent here.
You have some special insight that you'd care to share with us?
Detective Craig?
Might as well spill it.
Spill what?
I think I might've met Sadiq before.
What are you talking about?
Drones destroyed Zamindawar in 2011.
My unit came through on clean up, and I found Sadiq.
He was just a kid then, but he understands their power.
Every Afghani does.
Why didn't you tell us about this sooner?
Because I wasn't sure.
He's telling you now.
Well, let's hope he hasn't cost lives.
Okay, blame later, catch terrorists now.
I'll mobilize SWAT.
We should evacuate the Convention Center.
Lock it down immediately.
Do that and these guys go to ground.
Sadiq will disappear before we've even had a chance to capture him.
Worse, he'll go on to a secondary objective that we don't even know about.
Now, look, right now, this drone exhibit is relatively contained.
Well, let me get some eyes in the sky.
That can't do any harm.
Okay, keep your crew above 5,000 feet.
I don't want anything to spook them, all right?
We'll work in pairs.

Detective Chavez, Detective Rourke, you'll comprise our second team.
What about me?
Craig, I'm sorry.

What?

If what you're saying is true,
Sadiq'll ID you the same way you ID'd him.
And I'm not gonna take a chance to jeopardize this mission.
I don't take my orders from you.
I'm sorry, Kyle, but I have to agree with Ivers.
We can't risk Sadiq seeing us coming.
You'll stay here until we get the all clear.
Listen, Sadiq is our priority.

Alive?
The end game is Elder Mudarris and his terrorist network.
The Wellsleys and their jihadist friends are all secondary.
We need Sadiq alive so we can turn him.
You're not gonna turn him.

Look at the big picture here, Frank.
Thousands of innocent lives can be saved if we capture Sadiq alive.
Last time you asked me to look at the bigger picture, you set up Carlos Cortez to die.
I'm not gonna help you serve up more innocent people just so you can impress your bosses.
Gentlemen, measure your weapons later.
We're here to catch bad guys.

We think Sadiq's planning an attack at the Convention Center.
We know.

You ready?
I've been benched.
Ordered to stay put.
Right.

But I just got a request from a motor cop I know, saying they need help with traffic control down at the Convention Center.
Let's roll.

- I warned you about Rourke.

You weren't surprised back at RHD when Detective Craig claimed to know Sadiq.
You think Craig's not telling the truth?
Oh, I know he's telling the truth.
Kid's hard-wired not to lie.
You're using him as bait to draw out Sadiq.
He's a cop, Ivers, and a decorated combat vet.
Please.

He created him.
Craig murdered Sadiq's entire family.
Radicalized him.
Craig?

Believe it.
We've been tracking this incident since it happened.
That why Sadiq is obsessed with finding Craig.
Which is why we've been saving Detective Craig for a rainy day.
Two dozen drone strikes later, we've picked off enough of Mudarris' lieutenants to where our friend Sadiq went from a nobody in Mudarris' organization to somebody we very much want to interrogate.
So you staked Detective Craig out and rang the dinner bell.
Our people fed Craig's location into the pipeline, knowing it would get to Sadiq, and Sadiq found a reason for Mudarris to send him to L.A.
The new stealth drones.
We got lucky there.
We take Sadiq, and we turn him, we break the back of a major terrorist organization.
Your trainee wasn't telling the whole truth back there, was he?
There was a fire fight.
Kyle ended up alive, Sadiq's family didn't.
Only that's not the way Kyle sees it.
That's a lot to carry, for both of them.
Kyle was just a kid himself.
There.
I got her.
She hasn't seen us yet.
I'll get on her flank.
She's made you!
Kat Wellsley, police!

Take the shot!
She's got a gun!
Get down!

Where's your husband?

Where's Sadiq?
It's too late.
The only one it's gonna be too late for is your husband if you don't help us.
He needs medical attention right now or he's gonna die.
Kat?
You can die a martyr if you want to, but it's not too late to save Alec.
I can call for help, or he can bleed out right here on the floor.
You can save him.
Sadiq's waiting in a van.
In the garage.
Please.
Please save Alec.
What color van?

Kyle.

Frank, Kyle's not here.
Roger that.

Would you have sat this one out?
Good point.
Detective Craig served his country, Ivers.
So did I.
And the kid deserves better.
I don't know who you're really working for, but it sure as hell isn't Homeland.
Your name isn't Ivers either.
Jack Ivers is buried at a military cemetery in Westwood.
So if I had to guess, I'd say you're CIA, working in the Continental United States.
I wonder what the U.S. Attorney would have to say about that.
Aah!
Now, you take comfort knowing that you died a hero, Boudreau.
I'm gonna recommend you for the Medal of Valor.
There's the van!
It's Sadiq!
Stop the vehicle!
Show us your hands!
It's over.

Guess I have you to thank for sending Rebecca and Tommy.
Couldn't let you miss all this.
What the hell happened with Boudreau?
KIA... pursuing two other jihadis.
One of them knifed him in the stairwell.
Died in the line.
Let's move him out.
And I told you we needed Sadiq alive.
He didn't give us much of a say.
Sure about that, Craig?
What's that supposed to mean?
Hey, pal.

He was supposed to be grounded, Frank.
Buy you a beer?
I appreciate that, Frank, but I already called Alyse and told her it's okay to come home.
I need to make things right with her.
Sounds good.
Honey?
With a blast radius this large, there could be no survivors.
You know, baby, I was...

Welcome home, Corporal Craig.
Sadiq.

Please.
I said the same to you.

I wanted to stay in my home, with my family.
Did you listen?
Go on.
Tell her.
Tell her how you killed my mother and father.
Brother.

I didn't mean to.

You're going to die here with a lie on your teeth!
That was no accident.
I was there.

You're right.
I'll die here.

But...

She has nothing to do with this.
Your father was murdered.
Your wife tells me you haven't been able to let it go.
I understand that.
Mm-hmm.
All this to find his killer.
And what will you do when you find him?
You will do exactly what I am doing.
You'll avenge him.
There is no Allah here.
No Christ.

This is between men.
- Kyle!

You remember it was your husband who killed you, not me.

You stay with Frank, you keep searching for your father's killer, and then what?
You done, babe?
Oh.

- Oh, no, no.

- I got it.

You must be disappointed.
I know you were hoping to hook Sadiq up to a car battery, but the kid opted for his 72 virgins.
Can't say I blame him.
Probably down to 60-something by now.
He ought to pace himself.
They've supposed to last him all eternity.
To what do I owe this?
Thanks of a grateful nation for your role in thwarting a mass casualty event.
Then this belongs to Sherman.
And Kyle.
And no offense, but I'm kind of particular who I drink with.
None taken.
Who do you really work for, Ivers?
Well, it doesn't really matter who signs the checks, does it, Frank?
I mean, we're still in the same business.
Oh, yeah?

Oh, we're in the omelet business.
We're the guys they send in to break the eggs.
What are you doing here?
I came to give you some advice.
I'm all ears.
Back off Billy Craig's murder.
Now, I wish I could tell you more.
But I can't.
What I will say is this.
If you keep digging, it's not gonna end well.
Not for you, not for the kid, not for Holly, not for anyone you care for.
Sounds pretty sinister.
Well, there's nothing sinister about a guy standing in the road with a sign that says the bridge is out.
That's not a threat.
That's a fact.
I'll see ya round, Rourke.
Count on it.
