Ray, taste this.

No, you must, Ray, please, Ray.

Please, just for Mommy.

Come on, try a little bite.

If you love me, you'll taste a bite.
Come on, taste it, taste it.
It's disgusting, isn't it?
Somebody said it.

The word.
Them.
Who gets to tell 'em off?
Whoever finishes their drink first.
Come on, dude!
Done!

Is this your first DiMeo sensitivity speech?
I'll do you proud.
Why, hello there.
Starting quiet, good.
Get them to come to you.
Ooh, a little sass now.
Making it his own.
Wagging his finger -- Yeah, wish I had that.
Yeah, that's right.

They don't get to talk, you get to talk.
He's coming back, efficient.
[ Chuckles ]
So, they're never gonna use that word again, right?
They're having their driveway re-tarred.
Sorry.

-

Who is this?
No one told me Daniel Craig uses a wheelchair, or that his best friend was Mr. Ryan Gosling.
Told you Mom would think we look hot.
JJ, I know you shot me down when I offered to trick out your wheelchair for prom with a special disco-mode option.
I respect that.
This button is party-mode.
"No, no, no, no!"
Why not?
"I get too much attention at these things.
I want to blend in."
Well, good luck blending in, 'cause I'm afraid -- boop, boop -- your gorgeous-mode buttons still work.
Mom, you're embarrassing me!
[ Giggling ]
Darling, are you sure you don't want Kenneth to help you tonight?
Kenneth:

He won't be talking much at all once he gets to the bleachers.
[ Laughs ]
You know, under the bleachers?
Lafayette prom night?

Bone up on your French!
Kissing, that is!
I'll have what they're having.
[ Chuckles ]
Who is this for?
Oh, do seventh-graders go to prom now?
I'm working refreshments.
Now they tell me I'm just lining up cups of punch.
There's a month of studying Tom Cruise in "Cocktail"
I'll never get back.
**
Dang!
Ugh, balsamic vinegar and egg nog?
It's really more about the throwing.

**
Hey, aren't you the guy that got stuck in the school mascot costume?
[ Laughs ]
I'd like to think of myself as the guy who got out of it.
"Why is she smiling at that?"
I've heard about this.
I think it's called an aneurysm?
I'm Riley Mullins.
No, I've seen Riley Mullins.
I just had a bit of a makeover over spring break.
I lost the headgear and got laser eye surgery.
[ Whispering ] Dude, this is her first day of being hot.
She doesn't realize she's out of you league.
What's that?

I'm the best you can do.

[ Chuckles ]
Well, I'm gonna go stand behind a bar.
"And I'm gonna go blend in with an 800-pound wheelchair."
Good luck!
**
You ready?
Oh, sorry, JJ.
Hey, everybody, JJ's here.
JJ selfie.
Go, JJ, go, JJ!

Make some room, JJ dance circle!
All: [ Chanting ] Go, JJ!

Go, JJ!

Go, JJ!
**
Why is that boy staring at me?
Ugh.

Hey, she has a great personality!
It's so loud in here.
We should go find a quiet spot.
Maybe...

Oh, I don't know.
I -

"under the bleachers" is kind of a thing.
I know.
All right, then.

One moment, my lady.
Quick question.

Think of your tongue as a toothbrush and just brush her teeth.
Thought so.

What were you thinking, giving me this?
I was thinking it was a nice gift.
Don't worry.

[ Floor creaking ]
Sorry, I-I forgot this.
Look, I know it's not my place, but come on, guys.
Don't argue.

Go, you know, have fun.
We are.

Fight night.

We don't like arguing in front of the kids, so when we feel one coming on we write it on a bit of paper and we stuff it in the bottle.
You have a night all to yourselves, and that's how you choose to spend it?
Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?

Jimmy has this cute little vein he pops out on his neck.
Stop it.

Here, I'll show you.

How ungrateful can you be?
It was a gift for no occasion.
Oh no, the occasion was, "Congratulations, your fingers are the size of sausages."
Have you see how big?

What did I say?

Uh...

Are you sure you don't want me to?
Because I am, and in this argument, you're right.
Do you know, I quite like you being here, Kenneth.
Would you like to stay and judge the rest of our arguments?
I don't what to say except...
Judge Kenneth court is now in session.
**
"Hi.

No, my ex dumped me three days ago, and now she's dancing with some new guy.
Ha, you've realized the truth I've preached for millennia.
Prom sucks.
Caroline:

I can't believe I thought I'd have fun.
Now I'm stuck here for three hours.
"Why do we have to stay here?"
Ooh, a prom revolt!

Are you in, the tall girl?
Oh, no.

Because I'm cool, just FYI.
Okay, she just mimed spanking him.

"Let's get out of here."
Lead the way.
By the by, I am Erebus of Nighthollow.
You're not gonna question that?
This group is awesome!
**
I have a confession.
Oh, it's a prank.
Lure me here promising a kiss, then cue the guys in Reagan masks throwing tomatoes.
Fool me twice, shame on Ray.
No.

I didn't bring you down here to talk.
[ Notification beep ]
Oh, I forgot!
I'm spending the night at Lori's and I forgot my backpack.
My mom's outside with it.

I'll be right back.
Oh, she's perfect.
I'm so sorry.
I'm such a retard!
Perfect may be an overstatement.
Young man:

Why be tied down, Curtis?

What are you, a sophomore?
I'm a junior.

Marry that chick.

I've got customers.
Hey, Ray.

Riley?

Things are on track.
I mean, there was one tiny thing that kind of bumped me.
What is the Reagan-face kids again?
What?

It was more like she was being self-deprecating, and then she used this dumb word.
She said...
What?

Get over here!
Stop, that's not her!
Well, she's here, so she'll have to do.
Ew, who still says that?
[ Growls ] I know!

Zero-tolerance.

Don't.

Stop convincing yourself that that's okay.
What would Mom say?
She'd go off on her, but she has that luxury.
Mom's physically satisfied by Dad.
I don't have Dad.
What happened to you, man?
Look, you know I'm right, Ray.
You can't let this go.
Okay.

She'll see the light, apologize, and then it's back to "Who's your daddy".
She is.
You love him because he's your brother.
You love him because he's your brother.
I've reached my verdict.
Jimmy does not have to hang out with Maya's cousins.
[ Gavel bangs ] No!

Sorry Maya, I was really swayed by Jimmy's point about how hard they suck.
So hard!

The fact that Maya would not be able to keep a dog alive is not a reason she shouldn't get one.
The court rules Maya can get a dog.
Yes!

The court orders Jimmy to be a more tender lover.
Boo!

Boo!
The court, in its infinite wisdom, rules in favor of myyyyy friend Jimmy.
[ Gavel bangs ] Yeah, I think you're having a bit too much bloody fun with this.
Is Kenneth having too much fun?
The court rules...no!
[ Laughter ]
Wow.

No one's asked me, "How's the weather up there?"
in almost five minutes.
So, what's the plan, JJ?
"Go hang out somewhere else."
I like it.

"Non-prom!" Yeah.
You know, I didn't think you guys were cool.
But you kind of became my best friends.
"Feels fast for that."
Yeah.

Let's go.

[ Chanting "non-prom" ]
Non-prom pride!
We don't care what anyone else thinks!
All: [ Whispering ] Non-prom.

[ Whispering louder ] Non-prom.

Riley:

[ Lips smacking ] Man, this girl has got it goin' on!
Before we return to the main event,
I have something to say.
Earlier, a word was spoken that kind of threw me.
You said "retard."
What?

I didn't mean it literally.
I meant, like, "dumb."
Oh.

I wouldn't say I'm sorry.

It's not my fault that, in today's culture, people get upset by anything.
Should we censor ourselves simply because some unseen P.C. "they" might get upset?
That seems un-American.
Your argument is so pretty.
I'm captain of the debate team.
This is kind of my thing.
[ Whispering ] What's your counter-argument?
Uh...my family gets really mad when they hear that word.
My brother has cerebral palsy?
I didn't know that.
Does he have a developmental disability as well?
No.

Then that doesn't seem to apply.
But still.

But what do you think?
I think I think what...

I think.
Consider my logic --
"A," my intention was benign,
"B," language is evolving, and "C," that's a good thing, as it robs a hurtful word of its power.
You really say words good.
You want to take a quick five?
All right.

I've never had teachers' potato chips before.
"They're better."
[ Chuckles ] They really are.
"C-plus"?

JJ, you throw one hell of a non-prom.
What else should we do?
[ Gasps ] Ooh, maybe we could put on some music?
[ Beep ] [ Upbeat music plays ]
Oh, I love this song.
Caroline, Is there dancing at prom?
Well, yeah, but --
So there's no dancing at non-prom.
JJ, permission to expel Caroline from non-prom?
"I'm not your leader.
And also, permission denied."
Damn it.
Guys, it's okay.
If music is that big of an issue,
I can just go hang out by myself, I guess.
That's very thoughtful of you, Caroline.
Goodbye!
We found these fireworks on a hike in the woods.
I don't hate fun, so I wanted to set them off.
What's wrong with that?
You were a father.
And you were a mother, but not mine!
All right.

The court rules in favor of Jimmy.
Why?

This court has been consistently pro-things that make loud noise and are awesome.
That is true.

Time flies when you're screaming at your wife for sport.
Oh, no.

Fight about something else.

We've had our fun.
Nah.

But there's so much stuff you haven't covered.
The way she -- she always loses things.
And -- and -- and -- and her lousy driving.
Do I detect a new opponent?
Judge Jimmy.
Do I get to use Kenneth's gavel?
I'd say so.
I'll allow it.
Let's do this thing.

Let's see what you got.
Oh.

You do sometimes help yourself to our food a bit too readily.
Oh!

'Cause your cooking is such a prize?

Are you calling me fat?

No.

Yo, I'm out of here!
[ Door opens, slams ]
Agh.

No.

She made some really good points.
She wants to kiss you, Ray.

"You guys see a tall girl?"
I mean, I guess I'm pretty tall.

Wait.

His little girlfriend said the "R" word.
Oh.

Just because JJ has a disability, we should force him to be arbiter of al things disability.
Nice.
Look who's so sensitive now.
A real champion of the movement.
He still wants to kiss her.
**
"Then kiss her."
Really?

"I hate that word, but Ray deserves this one.
He's a good brother.
He has his whole life to educate people.
This is his one chance to kiss a girl."
Insulting, but accurate.
That's, like, the most generous thing anyone's ever done for me.
I'm gonna be kissing her, but I'm gonna be thinking of you.
So you got your permission.
It looks like the only person left you need to ask if it's okay... is you.
Oh, let me check.
Uh, he's good with it.
[ Door opens, closes ]
Sorry.

Don't know what's happened to my memory.
Perhaps I've eaten it like everything else.
I didn't mean any offense.
I mean, you saw Jimmy and me going back and forth.
[ Sighs ] I-I-I think it kicked up a few things that I've been feeling.
Clearly, your situation is different.
You know where you guys stand.
But us -- Where are we going?
Where are we?

I don't know.

I thought we were just, you know...
A-Are we really having this conversation?
Oh, you think it's early?
Mm.

It's coming up on a year.

I mean, we have a lot of fun.
[ Scoffs ] "We have fun."
This could all go away...

JJ's last aide -- Oh.

That was different.

Please.

I'm in this.

And I'd like some reassurance that you feel the same way.
Uh, you know what?

Kenneth.

I-I should go.
Oh, baby, no!

You been working on your argument?
Enough talk.
Riley, it's your lucky day.
Take me.
[ Laughter ]
Dylan:

Ray:

Maya:

You go away, too, random British lady who could be anyone!
JJ okayed it.
Jimmy:

What about people who do think a different way or at a different pace?
Should we reference them in a nasty way when we do something dumb 'cause we think it's cute?
Wait.

Well, it's a hell of a time to do that!
Just kiss her.

Shut up.

Uhh.

Look, what you said upset me.
I was always told that word was wrong, and -- and I never thought about why.
And now I have.
So thanks...

You can say whatever you want, and that's cool, but no tongue that says that word can brush my teeth.
Wow.
It's not the most logical argument, but that passion --
You really made me think.
Then think.

We got all the time in the world.
Are there any singles in here lookin' to mingle?

Who are you?

I sit behind you in science.
Riley Mullins?
You are crazy hot with straight teeth.
I am?

Does that matter?
Come on.

Let's go make out next to her.
Sorry, Ray.
This just seems easier.
If it helps, you really made me think.
It doesn't.

**
Oh.

"For someone who hates prom, you sure seem to like it."
[ Chuckles ] I mean, yeah.
I like the idea of it.
I love dancing.
I'm just kinda self-conscious.
**
"Go.

[ Scoffs ] Well, I don't see you in there.
**
"Caroline, would you like to go to prom with me?"
[ Chuckles ]
Okay.

And why did Jimmy have so many sleep masks for me to choose from?
Kenneth, it would mean the world to us if you would do us the incredible honor of promising to be a part of our family for a long, long time.
I know we play a little hard-to-get sometimes, but we've really fallen for you.
As a symbol of our commitment, we'd like you to have this thoughtful, but clearly man's, ring.
[ Gasps ]
**
Huh.

What? "Huh.

We just gave you a fireworks proposal.
How are you not moved to tears?
I mean...it's cute.
But Jimmy [chuckles] you were looking for an excuse to shoot off these fireworks.
And you want to get rid of this ring.
Hang on.
You barge in, hijack our night, we bloody propose to you, and you can't even pretend to be moved?
I've waited 15 years to set these suckers off.
We finally do it, in your honor, and I don't even get to see them 'cause I'm looking at your unmoved face.
Oh, look at you.

Such irrational anger.
I'm a DiMeo.
Ugh, I'm going to bed.

[ Fireworks whistle, explode ]
It fits.

I accept!
* When it drops, ooh
* I can't take my eyes up off it *
Hey, tall girl!

[ Laughter ]
Hey.

[ Laughs ]
* And under the lights when everything goes *
I feel everyone's eyes on me.
* Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close *
"Wait here."
* When we move, well, you already know *
* So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine *
* Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance * Jimmy:

* Feeling good, good, creeping up on you * ...JJ has come to his senses and hit the button.
* So just dance, dance, dance, come on * Let's hear it!
* All those things I shouldn't do * All:

* But you dance, dance, dance Dance circle!
* And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing *
* I can't stop the feeling
* Got this feeling in my body
* So just dance, dance, dance
* I can't stop the feeling
* Got this feeling in my body
* So just dance, dance, dance
* Come on
Excuse me?
Is this where
I'm supposed to come for the free telescope giveaway?
Hello?
Oh, no.

**
Damn it, Ray.
When will you learn there's no such thing as a free telescope?
Okay.
Well played, Reagans.
You guys -- You guys always find a way.
All right.

You've had your fun now.
Nice work.
See ya next time.
Missed.

Missed.
