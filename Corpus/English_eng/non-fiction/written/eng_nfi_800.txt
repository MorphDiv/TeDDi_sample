If the answers that we need to stop Savitar and save you are in the future, then that's where I need to go.
You're from before she dies, aren't you?
You trapped Savitar in the Speed Force.
Just tell me how you did it.
I had help.

She made the Speed Force trap for me.
You're telling me my ideas about the Speed Force...
- I'm right?

We need you to build this trap now.
Caitlin's after Tracy.
That means she's working with Savitar.
- So you talked to Cecile?

Told her I love her.

Like I told you from the beginning...
I am the future Flash.
♪♪ Dark music...
It's like looking in a mirror.
Well... not quite.
You're not so scary without your armor.
What can I say?
I outgrew red.
I know what you are.
You're a time remnant.
A temporal duplicate... created when you run back in time and meet yourself.
You brought a remnant to life last year to defeat Zoom.
Your duplicate died, saving the multiverse, and you continued your happy little life.
And it would've stayed that way, but then you decided to play God.
You created Flashpoint and changed everything.
I went to the future.
My future self told me that he created time remnants to stop you.
But you slaughtered them all.
All but one.
Me.
I lived.
But a funny thing happened when I did.
You.

Wally, Cisco.
You all shunned me because I wasn't the true Barry Allen.
I was an aberration.
A disposable hero.
Future you failed to mention that, didn't he?
How did you become Savitar?
I was broken... and alone.
I wanted the pain to end.
And that's when I realized the truth, Barry.
God feels no pain.
All I had to do was become one.
And I only need two more things:
for Iris to die so that you are driven so far into the dark that I can be born.
And the other?
It may sound ironic given who I'm talking to, but I'll keep that one to myself.
What happens if I kill myself?
If I die, then you'll never be created.
Cause and effect's a tricky thing.
Didn't work so well for Eddie, did it?
Shot himself in the chest...
Thawne's still kicking around.
See, that's the thing about time travel, Barry.
The more you do it, the less the rules apply to you.
But us having this conversation now... we're changing the future.
Are we?
My ascendancy is nearing.
When I have control of all of time, it will be you who is abandoned and forgotten.

*THE FLASH* Season 03 Episode 21 "Cause and Effect"
It's impossible.
I don't understand.

He's not me.

He's all the worst parts of you.
It's like in "Star Trek" when the transporter splits Kirk into good Kirk and bad Kirk.
Please tell me you at least have "Star Trek" on your Earth.
- "Voyager."

That explains why Caitlin was willing to follow him.
- He has a face that she trusts.

So when the Legends found that message in the Waverider from old you saying "Don't trust Barry Allen,"
it was talking about Savitar Barry Allen.
It's all coming together... in the worst way.
You said you made Savitar?
- How?

Four years from now, future Flash creates... a time remnant to fight Savitar.
But Savitar lets that remnant live so that it can later become Savitar.
So once Savitar is imprisoned in the Speed Force, this remnant starts to go crazy.
And he goes back in time to the past... and becomes Savitar.
Creating the lie that he was the first speedster, spreading the myth and recruiting acolytes throughout the ages.
That doesn't make any sense.
Which came first, Savitar or the time remnant?
It's a closed loop.

It's just one endless cycle.
Classic chicken and the egg scenario, I think, eh?
A time remnant, it's, um... it's like a duplicate of you, right?
So it has your feelings, your memories.
So why would he want to hurt us?
Why would he want to kill Iris?
H.R., how's Tracy coming with the Speed Force trap?
Good, yeah, good.

Get her to speed up, all right?
I'll do that now.

If Savitar is a version of Barry from the future and he remembers everything that Barry does, how are we ever going to come up with a plan to stop him?
What was he like?
Broken.
You know... all this time I thought that Savitar is this... monster.
It's hard to picture what might happen, and... it being you that...
I...

Part of him is.
He said it was like looking in a mirror, and he was right.
But not just the way that he looked.
It was... it was his eyes.
The pain that was inside them.
I've seen that in myself.
When I think about... how my parents died so violently... sometimes I want to repay that violence with more violence.
I want to make someone else... hurt as much as I do.
But you don't ever do that.
You're not him.

But it's in there, you know.

That power, that pain, that's where Savitar comes from.

From losing you.
You're not going to lose me.
Do you hear me?
And we are going to stop Savitar.
You are not alone.

And he is not a god.
Jay told me that we're not gods.
He was wrong.
We could be.
Any speedster, and it wouldn't take much.
When the love that we feel in our hearts is drowned in anger... when the bad memories outweigh the good ones.
What am I going to have to become to stop him?
Hey!

No, man, what's up?
I just came up with the best idea ever.
Either that or it's the worst idea ever.
- But...

It's an idea!
You want to give me a perm?
It's not for your hair, Steel Magnolia.
This is for your brain, okay?
I want to stop you from making new memories.
What are you talking about?
Savitar knows everything we're gonna do because he remembers doing it.
He's a future Barry.

You want to mess with his brain?
Just a little bit.
It's a minimal procedure.
It'll still be the same Barry you know and love, except he just won't be able to retain new information.
There's two types of memory, Allen.

- Long-term is where you...

This is my presentation;

This is the part of your brain that retains new information before sending it to the cortex to be stored forever.
So what if we block that chain... with a magnetic disruption?
So Savitar won't be able to remember whatever strategy we come up with to defeat him.
Which means he can't be two steps ahead of us anymore.
With any luck, we'll actually put him one step behind.
Beautiful.
Cause and effect.
Barry, what do you think?
Let's do it.
Wait, wasn't Caitlin the expert on brains around here?
She was.
But this is something we'll have to do without her.
I trust you.
You won't feel a thing.
Okay, let's get this show on the road.
The disrupter is attached to your hippocampus.
So, it's ready.
Okay, ready for zapping.
Can we not call it "zapping"?
Ready to activate.
In three... two... one.
- Sweet dreams, my beautiful boy.

Run, Barry, run!
I have watched you be in love with Iris...
Maybe we were meant to be together.
Okay, that should do it.
All right.
Right.

I feel fine.
You see?

Barry...
Barry?
Barry.
Who's Barry?
Not fine.
Who are all of you?
What's going on?
Seriously, who are you guys?
- Okay, Barry, stay calm.

- Cisco!

Slight wouldn't be a word I'd use.
Where the hell am I?
Is this a dentist office?
No, no.

St...

St... a laboratory?

- Are you guys experimenting on me?

Well, yes, technically, yes.
But... but it was consensual.
- You were?

Why can't I remember anything?
Why can't I remember my name?
Your name is Barry.
My name's not Barry.
I don't know what my name is, but my name's...
"Bartholomew Henry Allen."
- That's not a good name.

Are you sure I don't go by "Bart"?

"Bart" feels more natural to me.
- Can we go with Bart?

- Okay.

Okay, hey.

No!

- I'm not getting in the chair.

No, how do I know you didn't kidnap me here to do some weird brain surgery on me?
Or maybe you're like those criminals who trick people into hotel rooms so they can steal their kidneys.
Do I still have my kidneys?
We don't want your kidneys.
Okay, Barry... look at these photographs.
We're your friends.
Your family.
We just want to help you, okay?
That's a nice ring.
Who's the lucky guy?
You are, Barry.
Look, I know you're scared, okay?
You can trust us.
Cisco.
- A minute.

I'm gonna be right back, okay?
- Wally, stay with him, okay?

So how do we know each other?
Oh, I'm your brother.
There is no sign of any... permanent structural damage.
Then why can't he remember anything?
Julian?
He appears to be suffering from some sort of...
- psychogenic retrograde amnesia.

What if we didn't account for Barry's increase neural velocity, due to his super speed?
Wait, do we think he knows he's The Flash?
That he has super speed?
Hey, Barry.

Sorry.
Oh, my Lord.
- He's, like, god-awful.

Can't we flip a switch... undo it?
Okay, we are not flipping any more switches until we figure this thing out.
It's Cecile.

An emergency?
All right, bye.
Okay, Cecile needs Barry at CCPD, like, right now.

He can't possibly go out in that condition.
Okay, um, my dad and I will take Barry to Cecile.
You and Cisco figure out a way to get Barry's memory back.
And fast.
Yeah?
Okay.
Okay.
You don't want to work?
Well then, I don't need you!
Um, am I to infer then... that, uh, you've hit a little speed bump in your quest to build a device to trap Savitar in the Speed Force?

Accelerated matter microgenerator projectile.
No, I know.

No, it doesn't.
How about... we call this fancy device of yours...
- You know, you probably shouldn't...

Speed Force Cannon.
Speed Force Bazooka.
Speed Force Gun.
Speed Force Bazooka.

But if the Speed Force Bazooka doesn't start working soon, we're gonna have to start calling it the Speed Force Epic Fail.
- Why?

It sucks a hell of a lot of air watts,
- which is measured...

You need to take a step back... from the Speed Force Bazooka.
- There's not time.

Because sometimes, to move forward, you have to take a step back.
Step... back.

Barry can't do that.
Why not?

Bar, what's her name?
Um...

Oh, my God.
Is this... is this like a... like a Flash thing?
Was he battling a super villain who used his evil powers to steal Barry's memory?
Um... no, we sort of accidentally did this to him ourselves.
Why?
That doesn't matter.

Barry is in no condition to testify in court.
Joe, if Barry can't testify,
Coolidge walks.
And then God help us all.
Okay.

It was nice meeting you.
