Previously on "Rosewood"...
When Rosie is out-partying Joo-Joo, something just ain't right.
Damn!

He smells like hookers and cheap tequila.
Not cheap.

Flat-ass broke.
You're not taking care of yourself.
What you're doing it hurts me.
And if that doesn't mean anything to you, then, by all means, do whatever you want.
I'm gonna be okay.
I ran the additional test you asked for.
- Do you have family?

I think you're gonna need them.
Your recent bender did more damage to your body than we thought.
But the treatment should work.
If your body responds.
If it doesn't, how long do I have?
Let's cross that bridge...
Now, are you telling me I should get my house in order?
If it were me,
I'd make sure my business was on solid ground, just in case.
This is new...
Victim crashes through a farmer's market.
Oh, her name's Naomi Bauer.
According to witnesses, she made no attempts to avoid hitting anything.
We ruled out mechanical failure.
The car's in the middle of the street, didn't stop on impact.
Well, apparently, the car rolled to a stop.
When bystanders went to go check on her, she was already dead.
The car lost momentum after her foot slipped off the accelerator.
Looks that way.
And either Naomi wanted to intentionally hurt people or...
Something happened beyond her control.
Mm-hmm.
Please tell me that's not Blue Thunder.
- That's not Blue Thunder.

Hey, I'm just practicing what you tell me to do.
I don't like it.

Hey, guys!
Just so you know, I'm super pumped to be here.
And why exactly is Boy Wonder here?
Oh, thank you for that.
Which one do I remind you of...

I'm partial to Dick.
I just thought I'd get Mitchie some more experience in the field.
Doesn't this feel like old times...

You, me, us three.
Mitchie, it was one case.
I know.

I personally remember every detail.
Don't you?
♪ I'll remind you later ♪
I know what you're gonna say,
"Working a crime scene is our thing, not our thing and his thing." I know.
It could be his thing, too... in moderation.
At first, it was Adrian, and now it's Mitchie.
I mean, you're getting a little loose
- with the invites to our thing, okay?

What's...

Nothing.

Got to spread the love.
Whatever happened to Naomi, she knew it was coming.
Why do you say that?
Directions to the nearest hospital were pulled up on her phone.
So far, I don't see any wounds, so we could be looking at sudden cardiac death.
Or some other cause that we'll see in autopsy.
Let's get Naomi to the lab.
I'll call Slade.
Even though this isn't a homicide yet, this is definitely a case for you two.
Did she just embrace our threesome?
Well, you should say "trio."
Right, trio.
All right?
Okay, no, no, no.
It's...

All right, Mitchie, help me help you.
Bump.
- There we go!

There we go.

So much cooler than what I did.
All right.
Good morning, Mom.
Morning, Son.
You know...

Which one?

Well, the one where we were talking about finding an investor for the lab.
I don't remember having that conversation with you.
Actually, it was with your CPA, but it was near my desk, so it's conversational community property.
I'm not sure that's exactly how it works.
Listen, you have put your heart and soul into this lab.
We have got to find the right person.
Agreed, because the people I've met with so far are not a good fit.
What was wrong with that last candidate?
MBA from Harvard, owns a private equity firm.
Takes missionary trips every year.
How'd you know about all that?
Conversational community...
I get it.

He needs to understand family, and that guy just...
Clearly didn't get enough hugs growing up.
So why don't you help me find someone?
You know me.

Thank the Lord!
I thought you'd never ask.
This new investor idea is good.
I think Mom's gonna find you somebody great.
Yeah, I think new blood in the lab will be awesome, actually.
I have a whole list of things for the new boss man.
Okay, team uniforms better not be on that list.
They are.
And why do you have such a problem with unity?
All right, let's get to work.
Is it me, or is that...
That a lot of blood for a dead person.
- Tara, call 911.

911, now!
And what do you want me to tell them?

- That our victim is still alive.

Naomi's pulse is going in and out.
Mitchie, get the defib.
Pippy, you start the compressions.
I'll start mouth to mouth.
One, two, three.

Two, three.

One, two, three.
This is good.

Come on, come on, come on.
That is a lot of blood for a dead person.
- One, two.

That is a lot of blood for a dead person.
Clear.
Come on, come on, come on.
Oh, my God!
Oh, breathe, breathe, breathe.
Cover her.

It's okay.
Oh, my goodness.
Welcome back, Naomi.
Rosie?
Rosie?
You okay?
Yeah.

The meds are just playing with my head.
I mean, h-how did this happen?
Her clinical picture fits with diffuse paralysis.
She must have felt it coming and decided to go to the hospital.
She developed severe hyperventilation.
It made it difficult to detect her pulse at the scene.
Do we know what caused this?
Could have been a disease that we haven't diagnosed yet or a deliberate poisoning.
That's a no.

And she's not in any condition to talk to us.
So we're not just gonna sit here and wait for answers, are we?
Also a no.
As far as Slade is concerned, this is an attempted murder case until evidence says otherwise.
Ma'am.
Let's go check out her place.
Let's check it out.
When I saw you at the hospital, you looked like you were somewhere else.
Just getting used to my new meds and the side effects.
Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
That's it.

Let me know if you need anything else.
Thanks.
So, I'm guessing she's an editor.
She's not an editor.

Hello?

Girl, you here?
Detective Annalise Villa, EMPD.
Dr. Beaumont Rosewood Jr., forensic pathologist.
Wait, so a cop and a pathologist?
That's us.

I'm Craig.
That's Greta and Dmitry.
We're a part of Naomi's film crew.
What's going on?

She's in a hospital, recovering from diffuse paralysis.
What do you mean?

We're not sure yet.
Did Naomi have any enemies?
Maybe one of her subjects?
Need you guys to dig deep because it's possible that what happened to Naomi was not an accident.
I know who's at the top of my list.
This is when you actually say the person's name.
Emmitt.

He's this other director.
He and Naomi were chasing the same story, and Naomi beat him out.
And he wasn't happy.
Any idea what that story was about?
No.

When was the last time you guys saw Naomi?
It was around 7:00 a.m. this morning.
Why?
Because she crashed into the farmer's market around 9:00 a.m.
The paralysis was acute, which confirms that it wasn't caused by an internal disease, which means...
We're looking at an attempted murder.
Oh, God.
It's time to talk to Naomi.
Hornstock is looking for Emmitt Townsend.
Do you really think their rivalry escalated to murder?
Well, anything's possible.
For most people, the rivalry is not about the thing that they're fighting over, it's about the broken relationship at the center of it all.
For me, it was Connie Amicangelo.
Went to our rival high school, played her in basketball every year, and every year, that bitch played dirty.
Villa, I need you to let that go.
Tell me you have a rival, someone who was consumed with taking you down.
I don't know why, but that would make me happy.
Well, I hate to disappoint you, but I didn't have any rivals growing up.
So then and now, everyone loves Rosie.
You know, sometimes it's hard being around you.
Excuse me.

She checked out.
She checked out?
Where did she go?
Oh.

I think you lost something.
Detective Villa?
Where are we with the investigation?
Talk to me.
We'll talk all about it on the way back to the hospital.
Nice to meet you, too.
For one, my doctor told me I was poisoned, so I'm not gonna lie in bed eating Jell-O with my ass hanging out of a gown.
And, two, I just got here.
Freaking security detail drove her to the station.
Let me get one.
People have a hard time saying no to me.
It's a gift.
She's like the lady Rosie.
Oh, you're definitely going back.
No, no, no, no, no.

But first, you're gonna answer some questions for us, all right?
Yeah.

All right, tell us about Emmitt Townsend.
Uh, why?

Yes.

Oh.

Rivals since high school, competed over everything.
He likes to think he's better than me.
We spoke to your crew, and they said you got to a story before he did.
Yeah, and then he asked me if we could do the story together.
For some reason, he thought we'd be better on the same side.
I didn't buy it.
You know what?

You should never let your rival convince you that you're friends.
Spoken like a man who's had a few rivals in his day.
To be honest with you, I can't even remember their names.
I can think of one name you're gonna remember.
Hmm.

- Nothing.

Well, according to Emmitt's, uh, Instagram, he moved onto another job, never mentioned what it was.
Or the post is bogus and he's trying to hide the fact that he's still angry at you.
Naomi, do you think Emmitt's capable of committing murder?
Oh.
We've been going at it for so long...
I hope not.
All right, I'll put an A.P.B. out on Emmitt.
Anybody else we should be looking at?
Uh, I've done docs exposing corruption in the oil industry, on Wall Street, in the housing market.
So I've upset a lot of bad people.
Is...

You found someone.
I found someone.
Okay, don't keep me in suspense.
- I knew them from my days in education.

They have recently come into some money.
They studied economics in college, but found their real passion in education.
Their charter school is among the best.
Any idea what their offer might be?
Well, they're gonna want to be an equity partner.
Oh, love that.
But not the silent one.
Hate that.
Well, listen, with this kind of investment, they're gonna have a say in the day-to-day.
Well, I want someone who's content with the highlights, not the play-by-play.
Yeah, well, you know we need someone who wants both.
Separation of church and state... that's the only way this is gonna work.
I don't want to lose what we have.
I want you to have faith that you won't.
Beaumont!
Okay, set up a meeting.
All right, so, the hospital sent over a sample of Naomi's blood.
She was poisoned with tetrodotoxin.
Which is derived from puffer fish.
And prepped and sold in restaurants with specially trained chefs.
You know, i-it's weird that such an adorable fish can cause so much damage, you know?
They're like the baby bunnies of the sea.
My mom used to call me a little puffer fish.
I loved her so much.
Okay, for your safety, we're gonna start using the abbreviation TTX.
- Okay.

- Okay?

Hey, Villa.
We got a hit on Emmitt's toll tag.
He exited the freeway near his house.
Okay, let's see what he has to say for himself.
Mr. Townsend!
EMPD!
Hello?
Mr. Townsend?
You know I can't pass up pressing a flashing button.
Well, for once, I'd like you to try.
I don't think you mean that.
Did we just witness the murder of our number-one suspect?
Yes, but how did the footage of his murder end up in his house?
More importantly, where's his body?
I have a pretty good idea.
This is weird, but I have to ask...
Emmitt is deceased.
Mitchie checked.
Twice.
Naomi, you don't have to be the one to do the identification.
For reasons I don't want to get into right now,
I have to do this.
Just get on with it.
Naomi, we should go.
Let them continue doing their thing.
I may not be a cop or a pathologist, but I search for the truth just like you guys.
Someone tried to kill me and they did kill Emmitt.
I'm getting answers with or without you, so it's your choice.
The EMPD is processing Emmitt's house, and I have a team sent over to his office.
What do you guys have?
Well, there's an injection mark at the back of his neck.
And then they found seeds on Emmitt's clothing.
We also found cuts on Emmitt's arms, and he was super clean.
I mean, not like how Shaft was super clean.
But someone washed him and redressed him.
The body was moved and cleaned.
The killer really doesn't want us to find the crime scene.
But they left the video of the murder on Emmitt's home computer.
He was probably wearing a GoPro set to send footage to his cloud.
Trick of the trade, so whoever did this probably doesn't even know the video's out there.
Tox is in.

Emmitt and Naomi were poisoned with a synthetic TTX.
I'm sorry.

Yes, she did.
There's no coincidence that you and Emmitt were poisoned with the same substance.
We're looking for someone who had it out for the both of you.
And I'm guessing you know who that is.
The story Emmitt and I fought over...
I don't think he dropped it.
I think he kept on digging.
Who was the subject?
My story was on a company called Len Corp.
I think they were the ones who poisoned us.
They are suspected of kidnapping homeless people and testing new products on them.
And I'm guessing one of the products they make is TTX.
Among other things.
And assume that Len Corp is as powerful as they come.
But you decided to take them on anyway.
Eh, my default position is staring down giants with a slingshot in my hand.
So who's the man behind this company?
Ian Alexander.
He's a card-carrying douchebag, okay?
That's who we'll have Slade bring in, and before you ask, no, you can't watch.
If it was you, you'd want to stare directly into the face of the man you think tried to kill you, no?
So... if you don't mind,
I'd like to hear what the bastard has to say.
Len Corp and its subsidiaries adhere to the highest standards and guidelines across our divisions.
We will completely coop...
Oh, Mr. Alexander.
Based on my questions so far, I thought you'd see that I wanted to have a conversation like grown men.
Because right now, I'm not here to go after you.
But I promise you, I will... if we can't have a conversation like grown men.
All right.
Is going in there and putting him on his ass against the rules?
Yes.
But if it weren't, what would you do?
You ever seen "Hellraiser"?
- The first one?

- Flesh hooks?

Hmm.

Naomi, you just made a new dark friend.
Let's get to the point.
Naomi has made some serious claims against your company.
Despite the restraining order, she continues to harass our employees.
And what about Emmitt Townsend?
Equally a thorn in your side?
I'm sorry.

The other filmmaker who's investigating your company.
I don't know who that is.
Anything else?
That's it for now.
You can go.
All right.
Hey, I appreciate you guys coming in with your briefcases.
Very helpful.
Okay, so the C.E.O. knows me... but not Emmitt.
Well, it could be a lie, could be the truth.
That's what we have to find out.
Unfortunately, he is telling the truth.
Reading people is kind of my thing.
Read Rosie.
He says he's never had a rival, but I don't buy it.
Yeah, me neither.

Well, my someone is no one.
But Villa's someone has a Great Dane named Herschel and gives to charity.
You looked up my high-school rival?
When this is all over, I'm doing a documentary on you guys.
All right, look, I think that Alexander there is dirty.
And since I didn't get a Christmas present from you,
I want the proof wrapped up in a nice bow.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You didn't get the H3GB that I sent you?
The Hearty, Healthy Holiday Gift Basket?

Oh, right, right.

You can do better.
Slade, really?

Okay.
All right, so we have to prove that the TTX that poisoned Naomi and Emmitt belonged to Len Corp.
We have any idea how we do that?
Well, we got to get a judge that's willing to jump off a cliff with us.
- Diaz.

Really, Rosilla?

We wouldn't bug you unless we really needed the warrant.
And we come with a gift.
A Cuban sandwich from your favorite spot.
Bon appétit.
Nice boat.
The TTX found in our victim was synthetic.
Now, if the TTX from Len Corp has the same composition, we're looking at a pathological smoking gun.
Len Corp wouldn't give us a sample, so we're gonna need a warrant.
Judge Diaz, look, we're looking at two competitive filmmakers who disagreed on everything except that Len Corp was probably hurting innocent people.
I'm sorry.
I'm not sold on this.
Fight for the truth, investigate relentlessly.
That's what Emmitt's mom taught us.
She was our journalism teacher even though they were stupid rich and she didn't need the gig.
She loved working with kids, and she saw something in me.
So I made it my mission to own that class, and I crushed it.
That just made Emmitt jealous, so he made it his mission to take me down.
That just got me pumped.

I am who I am because of them.
She lit the fire, and he fanned the flame.
I I.D.'d Emmitt's body so his own mother wouldn't have to.
And I am bringing her answers as to what happened to her son, come hell or high water, so, please, Judge Diaz, please help us fight for the truth.
All right.
You've got your warrant.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The TTX from Len Corp didn't match the sample from you or Emmitt.
Okay.

I guess we should start looking at everyone else who wanted to do me in.
The Len Corp C.E.O., he didn't know Emmitt, right?
- So maybe...

The EMPD looked at his home computer.
Someone deleted all of his video files.
Whatever he was working on, they wanted that kept secret.
- Yeah.

I know what his documentary was really about.
We're on our way.
All right, we're here.
What was Emmitt's story?
Not what.
Who.
Emmitt was investigating you, Naomi.
Well, um... this isn't creepy at all.
I've never thought about what it's like for my subjects when I poke around in their lives.
You owe an apology?
Yeah, a big one.
I just wish I could ask Emmitt why he was investigating me.
I mean, maybe he wanted to get inside your head.
Find a way to outdo you.
Or the admiration grew out of the competition... he found something in you that intrigued him.
Really?

Guest?

She's family now.
Does anything in your life stick out as a motive for murder?
No.

We knew each other pretty well.
I can't think of anything that would...
I know that look.
I have that look... that's a family look.

I don't know where I came from.
I'm sorry.

I grew up in the system.
I was bounced around in foster care.
My mom dropped me off at a hospital when I was a baby.
I don't know anything else.

You...

I'm obsessive, okay, so that search would consume me.
I didn't want to get too lost in my own story.
There's so many others to tell.
Now it looks like I don't have a choice.
Well, but you've got help, so you don't have to dive into your past alone.
We need to figure out where Emmitt was searching.
The killer moved his body for a reason.
The crime scene could be a clue to your past.
Naomi, you okay?
What's that smell?
What smell?
Where is that light coming from?
Villa, call 911.
Naomi, lay down.

What?

'Cause you're about to have a seizure.
What?
I have an emergency.
So, we're gonna continue doing...
- All right, thanks.

It says here that seizures are a side effect of TTX.
So it's still in my system?
Your doctor and I, we think there's something else going on.
Your bleeding was spontaneous, and that is not a sign of TTX.
So we think that the TTX triggered a previously asymptomatic condition that's causing your seizures and all your other problems.
Hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and your respiratory arrest.
Do you have any idea what the condition is?
No, it's an unusual set of symptoms that makes it seem genetic.
Normally, we would pull your family history.
Right, but I...

Naomi... if we don't get a handle on this... you may not make it.
We don't know, but it may not be long.
Naomi, no.
Naomi, you're not going anywhere.
Yeah, well, if I only have a little time left,
I'm not spending it in here.
Okay, we need you to stay.
If someone told you you had to get... your house in order... would you sit around and do nothing, or would you keep yourself busy so you don't have to think about how scared you are?
Well, if they need to run some more tests...
Oh, then I'll come back, I promise.
We'll trace where Emmitt's investigation took him.
If we can find out who murdered him, we may be able to save your life.
Whoever it is, they know where you're from.
Oh, yeah, that's my crew.

- Knock, knock.

We come bearing gifts.
Flowers, balloons, some junk food.
And Semprex-D.
Figure you've probably been off your allergy meds a few days.
Yeah, no, the only thing I actually need from that list is the Semprex-D.
I'm blowing this joint.
We're going back to work, okay?
Oh, hell yeah!

- I'll grab your clothes.

Excuse me, nurse?

- Hey, I got something to show you.

- Uh, I got this footage.

- It's pretty sweet.

I'm keeping a uni by your side, and that's non-negotiable.
We're at a dead end on this case, but I'll give you an update when we have one.
Please and thank you... both of you.
- Cool, right?

Yeah, I got that wide.
Hey, boss man, you're just in time.
Team MCL has found something.
This clue is part cool, part weird, but full awesome.
Hey, can you just take it down a notch?
I can only promise you that I will not bring it up another notch.
Okay, let's see what you got.
There's a life that hangs in the balance.
Okay.

Okay, so we found nematodes in the cuts on his arms.
And once inside a host, they release a bacteria which glows.
Unfortunately, nematodes are widely found in soil, so he could have picked them up anywhere, and we can't use them to find the crime scene.
But it does confirm that wherever he was, he was exposed to soil for an extended period of time.
And the seeds in Emmitt's clothes?
Are from a rare mule-ear orchid.
And I did some research, and I found a conservation group that keeps tabs on where they grow.
Giving us a list of areas Emmitt could have been searching.
- Bingo.

Wow.

Why the hell would Emmitt be searching out here?
Well, I guess your rivalry with him was deeper than you thought.
I get that level of obsession.
Yeah, I don't think we need to hear about your...
When I was a detective, Naomi, the first time...
Yeah?
...my rival was a dealer named Remy Brasco.
Maybe we should save this story for another day.
I couldn't make any charges stick, so he would throw it in my face every chance he got.
So I worked day and night to take this guy down.
Please tell me that you got the guy, Ira.
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to teach you how to tell stories, my man.
I got him.
But it took time away from my family I could never get back.
That landed in a real way.

Thank you for sharing the story about your rival.
I didn't have a rival.

But it looks like we found something.
Hey, Steinbeck, after you.
I'll check upstairs.
Can't believe people lived here.
Whoever they were, they must have left this place in a hurry.
Makes you wonder what went down here.
Anybody recognize this guy?
I do.

He's that religious cult leader from the '80s.
He started off with college kids, then moved to recruiting families.
He stripped them of their identity, new names.
Stripped of their identity, gave them new names, new clothes.
Men in pink, women in blue.
I'll never forget that.
He had them convinced they were part of a supreme being.
He ruined their lives.
John Teller and his followers spent years in the public eye, and then... the cult just dropped off the grid.
Wow, this must be where they set up shop and murdered all those people.
And most of the bodies were never found.
Okay, but what does this have to do with Emmitt and Naomi?
I think I have the answer to that.
Naomi, what's wrong?
The baby in that picture has my birthmark.
My life started in the John Teller murder house.
I can't believe you already identified my mom.
Everything is set up in the conference room.
I...
When I said I didn't look into my past because I didn't want to be consumed by my story, that was only partly true.
I was scared that...
I would learn something horrible about where I came from.
And I guess I really hit the mark on that.
Look, I know...
I know this is hard.
But you'll get through it.
Hmm.
I'm just... still wrapping my head around, uh, living in the Teller murder house and Emmitt's death and the attempt on my life and...
Well, what's left of it.
I can't do this.
Hey, wa...

Don't go there.
Walk in my shoes, and then maybe you and I can talk.
Look, I can't even imagine... what it's like to walk in your shoes, but what if you had a subject who was scared... with a story that needed to be told, but not much time left to tell it?
What would you tell them?
That you have to meet your past head-on.
That if you are truly at the end of your life, you owe it to yourself to see how it began.
That fear isn't an option.
There you go.
Naomi, we identified your mom.
Her name was Colleen Brady.
She was a college student at EMU around the time Teller started his cult.
The photo from the missing-persons report her parents filed match the woman in your baby photo.
Now, unfortunately, your grandparents were cremated five years ago, so there's no other immediate relatives.
So in order to get a family history to save me, we have to find her.
Teller's adult followers are in prison.
Is that where she ended up?
Photos from the day Teller and his followers were arrested...
Colleen isn't with them.
The FBI made their case against Teller because they got information from an inside source.
You think my mom is the inside source?
And you think Teller found out and killed her?
Well, if that's true, Teller dumped his victims in the woods.
Colleen could be anywhere.
Well, we were gonna take a ride upstate to see if we could get one of Teller's followers to talk.
But then we realized Emmitt probably already did that.
I bet those cuts on Emmitt's arms are from the fence surrounding the murder house.
That's how those nematodes got into his body.
And the glowing bacteria is the result of prolonged exposure in the soil.
Like from excess digging.
Emmitt was looking for my mom's remains at the murder house.
Why would my mom go back to the cult after getting me out?
She could have just kept running.
Maybe she thought the only way to be free was if Teller was behind bars.
And working with the FBI was her best chance of doing that and seeing you again.
Whatever happens, take comfort knowing that your mother risked her life to make sure that you were safe.
We got something.
There are the orchids.

There's remains down there.
If Colleen has anything genetic, that information might help us save Naomi.
So let's get to work.
Yeah.
See this stain on the skull?
Blunt force trauma.

That's probably how she died.
Hey, um... thanks for the extra training.
Sorry I went full-science fanboy on you yesterday.
I-I just don't want you to think that I'm not totally focused.
No.

I love your passion and your unique prism.
You are a fan club of one.
But my prism gets me teased daily.
Yeah, I've noticed, and I can relate.
The way we see the world is what makes us good at what we do.
And I depend on you more than you realize, so... don't ever lose that Mitchie prism.
So I guess we're two peas in a pod?
More like two peas, adjacent pods.
Yeah.

All right, so, DNA confirms that these remains belong to Naomi's mom.
And there's an inhomogeneity in the density of the pelvic bone.
Bone disease.

What does the bone biopsy show?
On it already.
Your mother had bone cancer.
And like her, you have Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
Makes you prone to tumors.
We found one in your left adrenal gland.
So that's what was causing the bleeding and everything else?
They'll take it out and monitor it to make sure no more appear.
Now, I know this sounds scary, Naomi, but you're gonna be just fine.
Well, you saved my life again.
Did you use that humidifier the night before your paralysis?
Yeah.

Why?

I think I know how you were poisoned.
I was the rich kid who had everything.
Naomi was the foster kid who bounced from home to home.
The more we competed, the more I realized that Naomi is the better filmmaker.
She has this innate sense of story.
Thanks for being here.
I didn't want to watch this alone.
This is crazy.
It's just getting started.
And I had become intrigued by her.
She fights to tell everyone else's story, but not her own.
And the more I thought about that, the more I loved the idea of telling the one story
Naomi was unwilling to tell not to get back at her, but to earn her respect, to help her close a chapter in her life.
Emmitt didn't get a chance to finish his documentary.
So I decided to finish it for him.
He learned that Naomi's mother was Colleen Brady, and that she was a member of John Teller's cult.
He believed Colleen was killed by John because she betrayed him to the FBI and that her body was buried in the woods.
Emmitt didn't just find Teller's followers, he also tracked down everyone that lived in the murder house.
And John Teller had a son who went into foster care when his dad got arrested.
And guess what...

Filled him in on Naomi and his documentary.
Hold on.

You couldn't punish Colleen for sending your father to prison, but you could take out revenge on her daughter.
So you joined my crew, got close to me, and almost committed the perfect murder.
But you didn't count on Naomi surviving, right?
Which meant you had to kill Emmitt, too, because you knew he would piece it all together.
So you followed him to the murder house, you dosed him, then you moved him back to his house to avoid suspicion.
Dmitry, we found TTX on the water reservoir and your prints on the outside of the tank.
Your mom ruined my life, and I lost my dad because of her.
Give him my regards when you see him in prison.
Good afternoon, Mom.
Hi.
Look...

- to meet with the potential investor, but...

But why don't you seem surprised to see me?
I'm not because... you are the investor.
When did you find out?

The minute that you said that the investor studied economics.
I mean, come on, Mom.

Well, you could have said something!
Oh, a story about a pot and a kettle comes to mind.
I was just afraid that if I came to you directly, you would...
You thought I'd say, "Stay in your lane."
Yes.

Well, because the more that I thought about it, the more it made sense.
And, it's like you said,
I have to have faith that being in business together is not gonna affect us being mother and son.
Where'd you even get the money to even think about doing this?
Gerald got a settlement from the state for wrongful imprisonment.
He...
He paid me back with interest for the money I invested in his defense.
Now, are you sure you want to be my partner?
'Cause you could do anything with that money.
Son...
I can't do very much to ease your physical pain.
And if your health, you know, takes its toll again, then... at least you'll know the lab is in good hands.
So we're doing this?
Yes, we are.
Rosie!
What are you doing here?
Well, I just thought I'd stop by, check in on you before your surgery.
You nervous?
Yesterday, I didn't think I'd see tomorrow, so...
Well, I'm not scared of going under the knife.
You know reading people is one of my gifts, right?
Oh, I know, and being unreadable is one of mine.
Not today.
I figured out who your rival is.
Mm, I don't have a rival.
You do.
It's not an old classmate.
Your rival is you.
More accurately, your health.
Been going neck and neck with it my entire life.
I just don't know how much longer I can do it.
I'm just tired.
You're not tired.
You're David... staring down a giant.
I need you to load that slingshot one more time.
I mean, you've beat Goliath before.
You can do it again.
So, what are you gonna do next?
Mm.

Make some more films.
Search for long-lost relatives.
Hmm.
What?
What's this Rosie smile about?
Well, let's just say you're not the only one who can read people.
No.
Long-lost relatives?
Oh, my God!
- Hey.

- Um, I'm Naomi.

Oh, my goodness.

Pleased to meet you.

Rosie?
You okay?
Yeah.
