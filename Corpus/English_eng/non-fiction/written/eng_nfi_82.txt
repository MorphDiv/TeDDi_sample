Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school.
Our teacher, Miss Keane, told us that last year.
I think she said it to inspire us.
Didn't half make me think we were wasting our time, though.
No.
Your teacher's not the one who said that.
No?
No.
- Albert Einstein.

- Right.

THEY LAUGH
So, are you looking forward to tomorrow?
Yeah.

Missy, are you drunk?

- Yeah.

I suppose so.
I might be sick.
Right.
Careful.
Come, come.

What you've been doing?
- I'm fine, Mum.

- Look, here's your bag, Nanna.

- Don't forget your blanket, Nanna.

Thank you.
- Ready?

- Nas!

- Yeah, I've got to go to the post office.

Hi, Hayley.
Well, would you look at that?
It's like opening time at visa section.
- Nana!

Have a nice day.
Benefit scrounger.
- Right, girls.

Have a nice day.
Ta-ra, love.

See you later.
Today, two completely segregated schools start a new life together.
This is Ackley Bridge College, a new school with a new attitude.
Ackley Bridge is one of the most divided communities in the UK.
Whites and Asians live side-by-side but in totally different worlds.
Worlds...?

Experience...

- Stick your chest out.

You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- I mean for confidence.

I know you're confident, but you don't look confident.
You're making me nervous, you.
- Just go and see if Sadiq's here.

What do you need him for?

- I'm helping you.

Cos you know all about public speaking, don't you,
- with all your PE and that.

- You are so kind to me.

That whole chest thing, really useful.
- I'm going to use that all day.

How are we feeling, Mrs Carter?
Mr Carter.
Mr Bell.
Oh, I do like a man who keeps his name.

So, do you want to go through your speech?
What if I just want to surprise you?
No, no, definitely no surprises.
And did I say I were late?
Do you mind introducing yourself to fourth gear?
- Are you a teacher?

You're not from round here, are you?
- I'm from...

Mustn't give pupils intimate details of your own life, sir.
You might get trolled.
And believe me, this town's troll heaven.
Really?

- I'll bear that in mind.

- Is it?

- Miss Keane!

Hey!
How have you been?
- Good.

How's your mum?
How are you?
Just wish I hadn't dropped out last year.
Gonna be in class with my little sister now.
You had a tough time.
I'm glad you came back.
I'd give you a hug, if only the school'd let me in
- and I weren't already in trouble.

Cos I'm late and I'm wearing flip-flops!
And I have to let you know how proud I am of this team and all the work we've done so far.
But today, today is our chance to prove ourselves...
I know it's a long shot, but does anyone have a spare pair of shoes?
Today is the day that we prove ourselves to the kids and to the community, both of which are equally important to me and this school, and I think to all of us.
That's it, really.

If you haven't introduced yourselves to each other...
Sammy.
What are you doing here?
- Are you a teacher?

I'm community liaison.
I'm loving this.
Come here.
Why weren't you hugging me back?
- I'm just surprised to see you, that's all.

This is my town.

I haven't seen you for years.
I like your shoes.
- You're not pleased to see me.

It's nearly 8:30.
Flights and that, I got stuck.
Right, so you weren't at inset day, you don't reply to your e-mails, and what is that?

Me backpacked got nicked.
Getting emergency documents isn't easy, Mand.
It's Mrs Carter now.

All right, all right.

- You knew I'd be here.

Come on.
BELL RINGS
I've got to go.

- It's not your school, it's our school.

Settle down, please.
Excuse me.

- Sorry, sir.

Thank you.
- My name is Mr Bell.

LAUGHTER
Very good.

Right, when I point to yous,
I want you to shout your names loud and proud.
- Go.

Razia Paracha.
- Missy BOOTH!

- Go.

- Very good.

- Name.

- Are you stupid?

Sit down, please.
Are you lot on steroids?

All right, joker.

It is my real name.

- Pervert more like.

His name is Jordan Wilson, and he's a wind-up.
All right.

Good morning, students.
Year 11, 12 and 13 assembly in the main hall will commence in ten minutes.
Today is the day when two completely segregated schools,
Stanley Nunn High School and St Jerome Community College...
- Put it away.

We will not require improvement.
We will not settle for good.
Together, we can be outstanding.
APPLAUSE
Thank you, Mrs Carter.
Hello, Ackley Bridge.
For those of you who don't know me,
I am the school sponsor, Sadiq Nawaz.
Me and Mrs Carter have worked closely together in the planning of this merger school, and have made an effort to delve deeper into one another's cultures.
Ooh-la-la!
LAUGHTER
Over the summer, Mrs Carter accompanied myself and some other governors on a trip to Pakistan.
Pakistan!
She learned a lot of things.
We hope our friendship can be an example to this school,
- and to you all.

What are you smiling for?
BELL RINGS
What do you think you're doing?
That's out of order!
Get him!
He's talking about white girls, too, you know!
SHOUTING
- Get him!

- What an idiot.

- doing that?

Do you think it's funny?
THEY ALL SHOUT
What were you thinking?
- It's not funny.

Don't encourage him.
You'll be laughing on the other side of your face when you get in there!
If it were another kid, an Asian kid, would you be letting him back in?
Was it stupid?

But since when do we give up on kids that easily, eh?
Isn't this a matter for the board?
You know what, a school sponsor doesn't actually get to decide
- who stays in school and who doesn't.

- Jordan Wilson is just...

You don't know the kid, right.
What are you trying to help him out for?
I'm not trying to help him out,
I'm trying to make the school work, like you, and like you.
He thinks we're going to fail.
He thinks this place is a joke.

Let's not give him what he wants.
Send him home for the rest of the day.
Tell him he's on report, reporting to you, mind, Steve.
And I want a meeting tomorrow with Prevent.
Get Mr Qureshi to set that up.
Thanks.
You just can't help yourself, can you?
Come on.
Uhm...
- This your dad, yeah?

- Jordan, come on.

I've got five minutes if you want to talk about anything.
What's there to talk about?

Do I have to ask twice?

Coming?
Yeah...
Yeah, I'm coming.
On the first day of school?

- Integrated?

If that was one of us, we'd be arrested by now.
- You just don't get it.

So you're suddenly all over it.
I just don't want to start a bloody war about it.
Lads!

ALL:

Miss me?
Hello, boys.

Mr Simpson is new.
Try-outs are all on Mr Simpson today, so...
All right, well, before we go up to the pitch, who usually picks teams?
- I was captain at my old school.

Well, go for it, then.
I really don't think that's a good idea.
- Zane.

- Amin.

- Mo.

- Waqar.

- Hamza.

- Habib.

- Nahail.

- Ismail.

- Azhar.

- Aman.

Abdullah.
Sweet.
- Actually before we start...

ALL:

I was doing my rounds.
Do you mind if I observe for a bit?
Yeah, absolutely.

We're just drafting up a class contract.
Whose wants to share with Miss Carter one of their clauses?
- Hayley Booth.

I wouldn't dream of ruining your weekends.

Here.

Anywhere?
Don't look at me.

"imaginative interpretation", stuff that gets you all the way to level ten.
- Razia?

I don't want any books written by white dead men.
With you there, kid, but unfortunately that's 99% of our reading list.
Miss Carter, any thoughts?
I'm sure your syllabus is full of diverse and dynamic texts.
Tell you what, we give 'em a go and if we can't find anything that speaks directly to your lives,
- we bin 'em.

Agreed, Miss Carter?
Mum!

- Chloe...?

Answer your phone.
GASPING
SHE WHISPERS:

The kid's a racist.
Come on, man, loosen up.
I thought it were funny.
Why are you selling bacon crisps?
Hm?

They sell 'em at the bloody Lidl as well and your mum's always shopping there.
They've not been near a bloody pig.
Do I get free stuff, Mrs Paracha?
Do I look like charity?

Hey, who's the fitty with the braces?
Uhm... that is Alya's twin.
Don't worry, I don't go out with schoolboys.
We like real men, don't we, Nas?
We're gonna go to sixth form hub.

Yeah, Mira will be there.
Have an apple, love.

It'll settle your tummy.
Are you ready to tell me what's going on?
Dad threw me out.
Said it wasn't working.
Chose Eve over me, Mum.
- So I got an Uber here.

From Peckham?
You... you know, uhm...
- Eve's pregnant?

Yeah.
No warning.

There's literally no room for me there.
My room's gonna be a nursery.
I'll sort it.
Call your dad, we'll get you back down to London.
I'll be back in a minute.
She's had a fallout with her dad.

- She doesn't normally do this.

Have you got a problem with my work?
I think you've got issues with authority.
Power's gone to your head.
You're talking about throwing the classics in the bin!
It's day one, get their attention.
- Give me some credit, Mand.

Hit them with facts.

Oh, but you'd know that, if you'd been to the inset day.
She can't stay here in that state.
Hiya.
Seriously, what's so good about in here?
You've got a coffee machine, which is impressive and everything, but it's still school.
I'm your age, don't worry.
You've just all got to be dead to me cos you passed exams and that.
It weren't her fault.
She's in our year, really, she's just got to retake.
Thank you, Nasreen.

Missy Booth.

Got a thing for it, have you?

Teachers will be well pleased to see me talking to you all.
Ain't that the point of this school?

You're real nice, you.
Loving your friends, Nas.

- Please.

- Missy.

Ta for the support(!

She's all right, you know.

Nas, drop the kanjari.
- That's really rude.

If you wanna play with your gori mate, we're not stopping you.
Emma?
There's a bunch of us going for a meal later at the pub if you fancy it?
I'll be on chunder alert.
- I heard.

Come later if she crashes out.
- Everyone's going, right?

Might do.
- See you.

See you.
- Takeaway tonight?

This budget stuff with Sadiq.
I know.

There's a few of them going for a bite to eat though.
- Will you get them in a round for me?

I'll be back soon as I can.
Stop kissing the boss.
Oh.
Oh.
Why do you still live in this place?

- I like it.

It's your dad!
Oh.

- Not picked up your calls all this time?

Then let him ring,
- let him wonder where I am.

About time.

Chloe's here, in bits cos of you.
Of course she's upset!
- What?

- She did?

Okay.

- She tripped.

You don't understand.

So, you attack her?
She came over, all hands over me, so I just... pushed her off.
Unbelievable.
Mum, she tripped.

Stay out my sight, Chloe.
- I'm going out.

- No, Mum, believe me.

You lied to me before
- and you're doing it again.

And now you expect me to stay in and nurse you through your hangover?
Forget it, Chloe.
I'm gonna go home, then.
I'll book an Uber... again.
Don't even try it.
I'll do what I want!
SHOWER RUNS, MUSIC PLAYS
Forget it, Chloe.

EMMA SINGS
Out.
- PHONE BEEPS

Oh, my God.
Have you seen this?

She must have been hacked.

How was school with all that new lot, then?
Oh, Jordan Wilson insulted half of the school.
Jordan?
That, that's not Muslim, is it?
- While you're up there...

It's Mum.
Oh, Mum.

You'll have to chuck that duvet.
Dunno where she's been or what she's been using.
Where you going?
Got to see if all my stuff's still there.
Where am I?
Your home, Mum.
My Missy.
Best girl.
Dinner's getting cold down here.
- Is there food going?

What's her problem?
I'm clean.
Next door, then?
LAUGHTER
Oh, I love that joke.
Hey, Steve did you go to Pakistan in summer?
No, no, Mandy, she wouldn't let me.
But she went with governors and that, so can understand it.
Can't believe you let him take her away with no supervision.
Supervision!
Hey, just saying.
Someone told me Sadiq runs a mattress company cos he's "bedded" half the women in the valley.
Oh, Okay.
Anyone for pudding?
Nana, I've got to sing Valerie.
It's just about to start.

How am I gonna know if I won owt, now?
I've got to do it for my assembly.
- Assembly?

MUSIC:

BOTH: ♪ Well, sometimes I go out by myself ♪
♪ And I look across the water... ♪
The door's locked.

Out the back.
♪ Since I've come on home well, my body's been a mess ♪
♪ I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress ♪
♪ Won't you come on over ♪
♪ Stop making a fool out of me ♪
♪ Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

You know you have to stop.
They're too young to be dealing with all this.
All what?
It's good job there isn't man in this house.
You know, they wouldn't allow you through, the state that you're in.
Oh, my God, have you seen this!
Don't show people that.
It's all over the internet.

I'm sure SHE didn't put it up!
What's she doing with a photo like that?
Why, you judging?

- Have you got a problem with them?

- Missy, I know Alya can be a bit...

Why don't you just tone it down a bit?
That way, you know, she won't have anything to moan about.
Armley Prison?
Where did you think I'd gone?
To Burnley, to work for your uncle.
Yeah, I went to Burnley to work for my uncle.
Come on, I thought your were smart.
Oh, yeah, smart me.

You've seen my kid.
I didn't mean that.

I was just really young.
It didn't take you long to get over me, then, did it?
I heard you had to find Allah to get over me.
Oh, you heard that, did you?
I'd better go.

Anyway, thanks for the lift.
It's all right.
Night.
I could have had an extra hour in bed.
- Sorry.

All right, what do you want me to do, drive home drunk?
I was being responsible.
You don't sound that responsible, you was out all night drinking, in school.
You was out all night drinking with...
Sadiq.
You worry too much.
Mum, please don't make me go in.
- Mum, please, my temperature was over 40!

Because you put your thermometer next to your cup of tea.
BOY WOLF WHISTLES
Ignore him.
Do you have to work today?
Pull a sickie.
Let's do something, me and you.
I can't just sack off work.
- Please?

But you can't stay at home watching telly, Chloe.
It's GCSE year.

So, why don't you get comfy... and why don't you lose yourself out on the windy moors?
I'll be back, at break.
THEY LAUGH
- I'll send it you.

She's gonna get in trouble, I told you...
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!

- Cos I'm up for that!

Morning.
Phones away.

Right, now, we're gonna find out what lies underneath it all.
- Adult content, Miss?

In your seats, come on!
Miss.

- you been on Twitter?

Miss Keane.
Do you always post your holiday photos online?
- I don't understand.

Do you leave your phone out in class?
My bloody daughter!
I've had parents ringing me, I've even had staff coming in here.
- Who?

MANDY SIGHS
I've got a governors' meeting tonight.

I mean, I already had to talk about Jordan Wilson, now this.
- The governors?

EMMA GROANS
What are you playing at?
What do you think you've done?
- I didn't know how to take it down, I...

This is my life here, in this town.

Trying to get me sacked?
You're not sacked, are you?
Just go!

What were you feeling, Jordan?
Now, we heard... that you talked about being a revert.
Are you interested in Islam?
You joking?
You previously went to a predominantly white...
- Well, that doesn't makes me racist, does it?

No, no-one's saying anything like that.
What were you thinking anyway?
I didn't mean owt by it, I were just trying to make a point.
- And what point was that?

He doesn't mean that.
No, it were about Muslims, wunnit?
Trying to get them before they got us.
Is that what you really think, Jordan?
It's not about what I think, is it, sir?

That's what counts, innit?
So go on, write it down.
"Jordan Wilson's a racist."
That's exactly what I'll be.
It were a joke!
I'm not saying she's a bad person or anything.
Oh, good, cos she's not.
Come on, Nas, though, the way she dresses, the way she talks...
- What?

The way she talks to boys and that.
It's embarrassing, she embarrasses herself.
Yeah, I mean, don't make this some race or Islam thing or anything.
- But I'm not.

Who would want to hang out with someone like that?
Genuinely, would you?
- Nasreen!

Nasreen.
- You know her?

Who let her in school?
Hey, you should see bruise I got from last night.

Last night?
Nas...
Nas, love.
Simone, get off!
Mum?
"Mum"?

Lend us a fiver, will you, love?
Sharabi.
What a kanjari.
- Her mum's the kanjari.

Imagine having a mum like that.
Why is he still here?

- Sir, he's right!

Because he has been dealt with, so sit yourself down, eh?
Oh, my God, Zain, just get over yourself.
- Man's a racist!

Everyone is trying to get on with...
- See what I mean?

That's not even cool, that, just after I've stuck up for you an' all.
- Take it off now.

You're not a Muslim, take it off.
- I'm a revert, aren't I?

- Make me.

Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

Anyone leaves this classroom, you are all on report.
CLAMOUR AND SHOUTING
Excuse me.

Excuse me.

- Excuse me.

What the hell are you doing?
- Did you just pull her scarf off?

- I'm sorry.

The poor girl is mortified, Steve, what were you thinking?
You said you would take care of this kid.
And I will, Mandy, can you not see that I'm dealing with it?
I'm trying to deal with it.

- Just lay off.

Here and everywhere else, it seems.
HE SIGHS
- Sadiq asked what would happen.

What would happen, you know, if I had to bollock you or pull rank.

Yeah, well, Sadiq should be minding his own business.

And he's one to talk about marriage!

What has that got to do with you?
Unless you're impressed.
Look, without Sadiq, we wouldn't have this school.
- I wouldn't have this job.

Yeah, let's all be grateful to Sadiq, because you have certainly been showing him how grateful you are.
- Haven't you?

- That's what last night was all about, isn't it?

- Last night...

Right, yeah.
Cos I'm the one that messes about.
- Just find Jordan Wilson.

OVER PA SYSTEM:

Hello, Ackley!
What do we all think of Ackley Bridge College then?
Are we gonna roll over?
"Yes, sir.

Get to class!
They think they can keep us quiet with a lick of paint and some crap about learning to live together.
We all know that Ackley Bridge is nothing but a left-for-dead town with foodbanks, smackheads and pram faces.
What you all looking at?
It doesn't matter if you're white or Asian.
There's no jobs for us, we're all going nowhere.
We, we're the immigrants.

If you're white, you're racist.
And if you're Asian, you don't belong.
- Get off and open the door!

- All of us.

Kick it in!

Give it here.

- Stupid sod!

BELL RINGS
Nasreen!
What, you just going to stand there and not say owt?
- Missy, I'm sorry.

While them lot call her every name going.
"Slag." "Nasty." "Junkie." My mum?

Treated her like she was scum.
Go on, Missy, smack her!
And all that before.

Two days in this school and you're so worried what the girls in hijabs think of ya.
Look, Missy, they're me mates.
You don't know them, like I don't know your mates.
It's not my fault you got held back a year, is it?
PUPILS:

Missy, what are you doing?
Oh, like you don't know how to fight back?
Oh, oh, cos you're so perfect!

You're such a good little Muslim, you fit right in with that lot.
You were out drinking with me in town not two nights ago.
With the "kutti", with the "gori."
Ohh!

NASREEN SCREAMS
PUPILS:

Yeah, come on, Missy!
Fight, fight, fight!
CHANTING ECHOES
STOP!
STOP!
Out the way!

- Missy, get off her, get off her.

You all right?

Move.

- You Okay?

What you expect, me to hit her or summat?
What are you doing?

- You don't know what she did.

You don't attack her in the quad.
- Sorry, Miss, about...

Calm yourself down.
- Can I go home, Miss?

- Please, Miss, can I go home?

You don't get many good ones in life.
Go on, take her home, go on.
I see.

Thank you.

- Do you wanna tell me what's going on?

No, I won't leave you alone.

Please, not you as well!
If it's not Missy, it's Alya telling me to be like this, not be like that. "Why you acting like that then?"
"No, don't do that..." It's just, this school is not what I'd expected!
And it's not fair!

Well, life isn't fair.

And I don't want the teacher phoning me again.
SHE GROANS
I am not having that boy ruin this place before we've even got going.
I know something's going on.
I've seen the way he looks at you.
After everything that's happened today, the way you've let me down, all you can do is talk about is whether I'm sleeping with Sadiq?

"Why it is important to respect other people's beliefs and cultures?"
At least two pages.
And we're gonna stay here until I say we're done.
I'll make tea.
Proper, like.

What?
Dad's on his way up from London to take you home.
I thought we can sit down and have a chat about what's really going on, with you.
If you want to.
I thought you hated me.
- Thought I was a right bitch.

No denying that.

I can't tell if you're joking.
You can't tell if I'm joking?
That's probs because I am so used to you being cruel to me.
Dad threw me out, you abandoned me last night...
But I think it's fair to say you got me back for that.
Can't wait for half-term though.
We'll go away, I'll book a surprise.
And then I'll take loads of really embarrassing photos of you.
Time's up, Jordan.
Don't play games.

If you put half as much effort into your GCSEs, you're gonna be laughing.
HE LAUGHS
Do you, ah, do you like drawing?

Oh, do you reckon?
Do you reckon I could get into art school with that, sir?
Do you reckon there's a whole world waiting for me, sir?
- Give me that sheet you tore out.

You know, I've looked bad enough trying to stick up for you today.
Enough now.

Were you sticking up for me, sir?
Sorry, I had no idea.

- a interest in me before, have they?

If you're gonna have a fall out with your missus, sir, don't do it where I can hear you.
I've had enough.
I've had enough of you,
- come on.

You do not lay your hands on a teacher, lad... ever.
No wonder your missus bosses you about, sir.
- You're a pussy.

You can't let her talk to you like that, Steve.

Especially when she's banging Sadiq Nawaz behind your back.
Jordan...
Jordan, just, just, just listen to me for a sec...
DOOR SLAMS
HE SIGHS
- Dad, I'm sorry for...

- Hiya, Nick.

Sorry about before.
She hadn't told me the whole truth exactly.
What are you doing?
What's all this in the car?
What's my stuff doing in the car?
- What are you doing?

Not just now.
- Nick!

- That's her home.

Yeah, Eve says...
- Eve says?

- It was an accident!

So it WAS an accident?
But she's says she can't be in the house with Chloe.
- So what do you want me to do?

- Why not?

- Chloe, I...

It's all right, love, we'll sort it out.

- You don't want me here.

Course I do.
Thought you weren't coming.
Course I am, you're Missy Booth!
I just thought we could hang out.
Just hang out?
Sure.
I didn't call you for that.
That what you think of me?

I'm not judging ya.
- I'm not!

Come here.
You know Nasreen?
Girl you were fighting?
Yeah, I know her.
She's not all that, you know.
Thinks she's way better than me.
Everyone at that new school thinks they're way better than me.
I'm just scum.
So sleep with her for me.
What?
