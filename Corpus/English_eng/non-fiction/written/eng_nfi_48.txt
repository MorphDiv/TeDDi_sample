Oh, that's very mean.
Oh, you will thank me in the morning.

It was a lovely evening.

Aw.

-Were they?

Your father and I, we couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Oh.

MAN:

A-And don't be too late, darling.
Eric won't like it if you're late.
I told him to stay at his old flat.
We might all end up back at ours.

-Answer my question.

Do you -

-No.

-No.

Do you love her?
C-Christ, no.
What is it?
This means absolutely nothing.

First and only time.
First and only time.
Then why?
Because you've always wanted to and this is your last chance?
Sweetheart, now, please listen.
Shut up!
Do you have any idea how stupid you sound?

Hi, Tara.

Big night, huh?

He's on his way into work and wondered if you were in yet.
Can I help you?
Yes.

I'll be getting a latte for the lady and the usual for me.

Why are you being so nice to me?
Because in about 20 minutes, you're all that stands between me and a summer break and the Joy.
Oh, Christ.
Um...
Uh, Rory --
Rory, um, breach of bail conditions.
Ray.
Breach of bail conditions -- allegedly.

-Ta, Pete.

Is that your brief?
Yeah.

Okay.
Hey.

Pete.
Thank you.
We're gonna need a cab.
It's all taken care of.
Okay.
That's my, uh, file by the way.
TARA:

One fraud, one previous -- possession with intent to supply.
RAY:

But the fraud -- 28 grand.

-Ah.

Good luck, magic man.
What's with the bag?
My luggage in case you fail and I go down.
Two parts of tight pants, a cork for the shower.
That sort of thing.
Three minutes and counting.
So you were cashing welfare checks for three years after this man...
-Alan.

Well, it's complicated.
There we are.

RAY:

Got me back to school, put my dinner on the table.
Cashing the checks kept him alive in a way.
TARA:

RAY:

WOMAN:

-What number is she on?

There.
Mr. McColgan just asked Ms. Fox out on a date tonight.
Just because something comes from your e-mail account doesn't prove that you sent it.
We may need time to consider our position.
I'll adjourn.

-Thank you, Ms. Riley.

The state versus Raymond Lamont, breach of bail conditions.
A fraud of 28,663 euros and now a serious suggestion of flight risk.
Mr. Lamont came into the station with a passport photograph to be signed.
Ms. Rafferty?
Wanting a passport doesn't prove intent to travel, Judge.
One might ask what else a passport is for.
I.D. Mr. L--
LAWYER:

Mr. Lamont is very young-looking and instructs that he requires such I.D.
for entry into nightclubs and such like.
Judge, the original charges are very serious.
The application for a passport is a worrying development, and we humbly ask for Mr. Lamont to be remanded in custody.
No fixed abode.
No employment.
Any changes there?
He's just entering employment, Judge.
Continue station bail.
Bring his pay slips on the next occasion.
Full hearing in a fortnight, I see.
I'm obliged, Judge.
CLERK:

I just told them you were entering employment.
I could be struck off for that.
-I appreciate that.

Get your stuff out of our house.
I want to sleep there tonight.
-Where'd you sleep last night?

-Darling, please talk to me.

Sorry.
Thank you...
-Pete.

Thanks for the coffee.
No way.

Pete, I have another favor to ask you.
I will give you 500 euro if you employ Ray for a fortnight.
No. [ Chuckles ] Sorry.

I mean, he's the nicest guy in the world, but that kid's unemployable.
Please.

I-I've gotten myself into a bit of a hole.
I-I can't.

You need a haircut.
Vincent?
Where are you?
I tried Dunbar and Calloway's, and they're all a bit arch, to be frank.
I have a client for you.
Um, Vincent, look.

-But I'm just not sure that --

And he urgently needs a really good solicitor.
Hang on.
Um, Pete?
You wouldn't have somewhere quiet where I could have a chat with someone, would you?
Yeah.

LUCY:

MAN:

Ah!

Where were you and what's going on?
I was down at the forecourts.
We have the archdiocese here in five minutes.
Okay.
Morning, Lucy, Fiona.
-How are we?

Mr. Pike, uh, come this way, please.
-WOMAN:

Ms., uh, Rafferty will see you now.
Just give me a minute, Connor, yeah?
Sure.
Tara, what's going on?
Good question.
Last night was my hen.
I missed Eric, so I went back to our, uh, flat.
And I caught him having sex with Caroline Walsh.
I thought Caroline had better taste.
[ Sighs ] I'm sorry.
Are you sure you're up for this?
I could use the distraction, actually.
Well, in light of what you just told me,
I'm not entirely sure I brought you the right customer.
Oh, I gotcha.
You're a man off the telly.
In real life, you're not so...
Tall?
Orange.
You and that bird off the news are exceptionally orange.
You look like you been tangled.
VINCENT:

Ms. Rafferty will see you now, Mr. Coughlan.
It's pretty full on.
Who are the two women?
I don't know.
Do you know who filmed it?
Well, have -- have you upset someone?
Someone who might be jealous?
Is someone trying to hurt you for some reason?
Not that I can think of.
Okay.

Presumably, the full film they want to run tomorrow is a good deal longer.
Um, I suppose so.
But you're not sure?
Well, s-surely you know where this happened.
Um, no.

You see, I've had, um, a very active and varied sexual life outside my marriage.
You have a wife?
Yes.
And I can't think what she's going to say.
I have, um, rather lost the run of myself.
Okay.
I'm gonna ask The World to pull it down.
And if they don't, we'll apply for an interim injunction.
Are you available?
I'm tied up with the inquiry all day.
Get the paperwork together.
If you get it listed for a sitting this evening,
I'll be there.
And I'll try and get somebody to track down the source.
Um, maybe you should go and speak to your wife.
I'll let us know what's going on.
Come on, Connor.

Thank you.
Oh, Vincent?
How is the inquiry going?
Madness.
I'm calling the minister in a couple of weeks.
I'll tell you, I'm gonna tear the house down.
Listen.

I'll talk to you later, yeah?
It's fierce claustrophobic in here.
I'll have it sorted out for you in a shake.
I can't make this place my office, Ray.
I talked to Pete.
He only uses it about an hour a month.
So as long as you need it, it's yours.
Look, I have to pop home.
I need you to do a few things for me.
.
.
ERIC:

-Thanks.

It is the end of the week.
-IRENE:

Irene, how are you?
Where is Tara?
We were meant to be meeting for lunch to sort out the seating plans.
She won't answer my calls, my texts, my e-mails.
Nobody here knows where she is, not even the girl who was there last night at the hen do, the one with the dark hair.
She can't tell me.
Am I to call the guards?
Irene, uh...

Irene...
We've established my name, Eric.
Well, yes.
Um, last night, I went to my old flat with a woman.
What?
And...

Understand me, Irene.
I love Tara.

It was a moment of idiocy, a mad, mad last...
Blast?
You fool!
You...absolute disgraceful fool.
How could you do that to my girl?
And now she's gone walkabout?
Well, actually, she came in early to box up her things, and she was in court this morning.
Well, that'll be Tara.
I want her back, Irene.
You are a damned fool, and you don't deserve her.
This can be fixed.
This will be fixed.
That's great.
And the I.T. woman?
Found her.
Meg Riley.
She's on her way here.
So is your photocopier, scanner, printer, and a landline.
Ray, do you want a job?
I thought I already had one.
Just for two weeks, mind.
Cheers.

I'll see you in 10.
-Ray?

Wow.
What is this place?
It's an old metalworks factory.
And now it's yours.
Ray, I can't use this place as my office.
Yes, you can.

Hi.
Oh.

-I will if you'll be Mark.

It's an obscure joke based on a children's book.
Oh.

Thanks for coming at such short notice.
There's this, um, film clip.
I've seen it.

Ah.

Is there any chance you could try and find the source of the film?
It's just that our client isn't being very helpful or forthcoming.
-[ Telephone rings ]

Hello.

Sorry.

Until Monday?
I'm afraid they're on a training day.
Okay.

Training day.
Uh, regarding the source --
Do you want me to use fair means or foul?
I don't mind, but I would rather not know.
Ray?
I need you to deliver this to The World.
And on your way back, get yourself into the tax office.
Yes, boss.
Hello?
Mr. Coughlan, it's Tara Rafferty.
I need you to sign some papers.
Can you meet me at the forecourts?
Sure.
Tara, what happened last night?

Yeah.

And this one.
I just really wanted to see Eric.
And?
And we have a problem.
What do you mean?
Oh.

Just try and keep thinking about who the source might be.
Thanks for that, Gillian.
Carmel?
I need to make a short service application before the judge arrives -- It's five minutes max.
You're kidding.

I know.

We also need to apply for it to be heard this evening.
-You're having me on.

The other side know I'm making the application.
Is there any chance I can mention it to him now?
Please.

Ray?

I'll serve the paperwork on The World by fax and e-mail.
I need you to meet me on the front steps of the forecourts
-with my papers.

Ray, I can trust you, can't I?
You will be here.
You're not gonna stumble up in an alley and snort some diet supplements, are you?
That's very harsh, Tara.
-I'll see you there in a bit.

Pete?
Yeah.
-Can I borrow your jacket?

Cheers, brother.
How are you doing?
I'm fine.
Vincent's fronting this one up, so he'll be here any minute.
A bit of a day, one way or another.
-Our replying affidavit.

This is Vincent Pike.

Vincent, where are you?

Ms. Rafferty, where's your counsel?
He's on his way, Judge.
Sorry.

Are there papers?
TARA:

Uh, my grounding affidavit.
And I've just been handed
The World's responding affidavit.
As have I. Carry on.
Um, in my respectful submission um, the publication of this video constitutes a gross infringement of my client's privacy rights, a man, moreover, whose personal and professional life are at stake.
Ms. Walsh, what do you have to say?
Ms. Rafferty has made the point, Judge.
Mr. Coughlan, who presents the TV show "Mr. Money Man,"
has carefully cultivated and nurtured a public image.
Exhibit 5, Judge.
As you will see from these press cuttings,
Mr. Coughlan has relentlessly stimulated the interest of the public with articles and features freely or even aggressively sought out by him and including images of his home and his homelife.
JUDGE:

Um...
Nobody, whatever their position in life whatever their errors in taste or judgment, however they may have broken trust or vows of fidelity, nobody loses their right to privacy or dignity.
Very well.
The defendant has published material of a highly sensitive and damaging nature to Mr. Coughlan and his private affairs.
It is striking that the defendant has not denied its actions in its replying affidavit.
Instead, it argues that Mr. Coughlan's public persona ought to deprive him of his privacy in this case.
Mr. Coughlan deserves the full protection of this court to spare him from the irreparable harm that would necessarily be caused by the defendant's actions.
I'm going to make an order restraining The World and The World Online from any further publication or dissemination of this video either online or in print.
I will reserve costs of the hearing of the action.
I'm sorry I was late.
I was on the phone to the minister, and...
Well...
ERIC:

I wish I could make it so that it never happened.
I love you, and I need to see you.
Please.
So they've taken the video down, but we still haven't found the source.
WOMAN:

Tara?
Mum?
Mum.
What is going on?
We were meant to have lunch.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mum.
There's just been, um...
We're, uh, we're -- we're -- we're working here.
I talked to Eric.
Did you?
Good.
Could these people please leave?
No.

W-Why don't I call 'round tomorrow?
Hey?
Have you left Dunbar and Calloway's?
-Yes, probably.

And set yourself up as a hill bandit?
Mum, please.

Tomorrow.
Mrs. Rafferty.
May I escort you to the door?
I promise I will be there.
Right.
Okay.
Where are we at with this?
Connor.
They pulled the film.
I'm so grateful, Tara.
You're welcome.
But, um...there have been rumors on social media, and, um, I'm afraid I may lose my job.
TV Ireland have pulled my show tomorrow.
Have they?
That was a little bit previous of them.
I'll fix this, Connor.

Come on.
Just here.
Where are we at with this, Meg?
Do you notice anything about this film?
If it was filmed with a mobile or a handheld camera, it would be wobbling or moving around.
This is filmed with a decent camera.
Probably a triplex system.

Thanks, Meg.
Connor, you have to help us to help you.
Where was this filmed?
There's a club -- a sex club near Leeson Street.
Members only.
Were you aware you were being filmed?
Oh, God, no.
There are no cameras or phones or anything allowed.
Okay.
So what else?
No.

I just came to thank you for getting the film pulled.
There's no guarantee there won't be others.
I suppose not.
That's the risk.
I'll, um...

MEG:

Ray told me you're also a private detective.
-Mm-hmm.

It's a Saturday.
Please?
I'll make some time.
I've got a job for you.
It's an interesting one.
Mm.
That reminds me of someone.
But who?
I really like it.
But I thought it would be bigger.
We've had an 18-person Mongolian clusterfuck in here.
It's deceptive.
But we do have a bigger room.
Phew.
This is my boss, Pauline.
We have a potential new member.
I like new members.
[ Whistles ] What is that?
That is a sling.
You can hang it anywhere, then you can maneuver your partner at your pleasure.
Can't wait.
Do you have a partner?
We prefer it the first few visits if people come in pairs.
Well, I have a couple of lovers who might be persuaded.
You're a voyeur, I see.
Hm.
That's good.
People like people to watch as well as to join in.
Now perhaps I should take your details.
Maybe I should just think about it for a while.
I hope you don't mind.
It's a big step.
But I promise you you will never look back.
Connor?
Connor?
MEG:

Exactly the right angle.
Tara.
Sorry.
Um, it's a concealed camera?
I'm certain of it.
Okay.
Sorry, Meg.

-Meg, can I call you back?

Tara Rafferty speaking.
Hello, Tara.

He's gone.
And there's a new film.
Somebody e-mailed it to Connor.
It has to be a warning or a threat.
Okay.

I have no idea.

But I'm worried for him.
It's a little bit much for him.
Do you want to call the guards?
FRAN:

TARA:

G-Give me his car reg, and I'll do what I can to find him.
Meg.
I've traced the number plate and that mobile number you gave me.
Okay.
And it looks like he's driving towards Dalkey.
Oh, and I found two creditor claims against the sex club.
Really?
Cash-flow issues.
Well, that figures.

Tara, he's parked up now, on Killiney Hill.
Thank you.
We checked out a private members' club that Connor had used.
Pretty sure we know where the camera was located to spy on him.
He told me.
He also told me that they were trying to blackmail him.
A man he'd never met before spoke to him in the changing room at that club.
Said if he didn't leave two grand in his jacket next time he came, they'd expose him.
Fran, I hope you don't mind me saying this, but you don't seem rattled by any of this.
I knew what he was up to, more or less.
He was always a little sexually incontinent, perhaps.
But we all have different ways of getting our kicks.
He's my husband.
But I don't own him.
Do you want to talk to him or will I?
I already did.

Connor.
I just walked up with Fran.
She's pretty amazing.
She told me all about the blackmail.
Thing is, we all have our stuff.
Behind their windows and curtains, every home has their secrets.
It's just when someone gets caught out in the cold like you have, everyone sneers and jeers and chucks rocks.
It's a cheap and nasty laugh.
We're gonna do everything that we can, Connor.
I'm gonna stop those films.
You're gonna keep your job, and this is all gonna pass into memory.
The stoning mob are gonna move on.
You're a very kind woman.
Let's go home.
So the camera's in there?

MEG:

On the top.
Hello.

Hi.

I'm acting for Connor Coughlan.
I'm sure you know who I mean.
I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave.
You just be quiet and listen to me.
You are so lucky that my main concern is the happiness, welfare, and privacy of my client.
I could call the guards, get all manner of warrants issued against you.
I could start my own disclosure proceedings, get a judge to order you to open all your books, all your club rules, all your membership lists.
But best for Mr. Coughlan if you just refrain from releasing any more films of my client.
Oh, and do tell your boss.
Pauline, is it?
Or we will.
Thanks, Meg.

No problem.
Oh, hello, darling.
Oh, lovely flowers.
CONRAD:

Come on.

-Now, Tara.

Sorry, Mum.

You have to eat no matter what's going on.
Eric told me what happened.
And...

It's all right, love.
It must have been so...crushing.
Yes, it was.
Well, that's covered, that, then.
Well, Eric was very sad and very sorry and ashamed and...
Contrite.
Penitent?
Upbraided?
Yes.
He wants to win you back.
Mum, this has all just happened.
I-I can't even think straight at the moment.
We absolutely understand and empathize with how you are feeling.
But trust me.
Time heals.
So I've heard.
So I propose to take time.
CONRAD:

Yes.

But...
But what?

Some attempt to save the wedding?
Yeah, time might heal, Mum.
But two weeks is gonna heal what I'm feeling?
But you are such a lovely couple.
Listen to me.
If this is about the wedding, I will cover all the costs.
I'll pay for everything.
People make mistakes.
Your father's been no angel.
Jesus.

Listen.

You're not hearing me.
This can't just be patched up.
Tara, I think you need to --
No.

Tara, what has happened to you?
What's happened to me?
I have just found the man I love, the man I was about to marry, deep inside a professional colleague!
And he was fucking loving it!
Tara.
CONNOR:

I'm Connor Coughlan, and it's been another...
RICHARD:

He's our client.
Tara's well within her rights.
She didn't sign a contract with us.
We never got 'round to it.
Get the wedding back on.
Offer her a partnership.

But I do care about having to uninvite half of Dublin's biggest hitters and of looking as big a fool as you already do.
Do you understand?
I do.
I will do anything to make it right to get you back.
This can't be it.
You can't just stop loving me.
I don't know how I feel.
I want you to be my wife.
Eric, the wedding is gone.
Us?
I don't know.
Loving you was all that I knew.
And now everything has changed.
I have to go.
Where's Karen?
If it's Sunday, it's rock climbing with the Hermann Hesse Society.
Ooh.

A smorgasbord of paperwork.

VINCENT:

Only there's one part I'm missing.
I've got statements from all levels of the department -- health board, consortium, architects, contractor, and project managers -- but nothing from the vital source, Timothy York, the man who recommended the Irish Oak bid,
as he is inconveniently and irredeemably dead.
Oh.
Oh.

Thinks you're a goddess.
Yeah, he's right.

You know, once the broadcasters heard "Unfair Dismissals Act"
and "high court damages and costs," they folded.
Honestly, Tara, I don't know how you've done it considering what's been going on.
Don't be nice to me or I will cry.
Okay.
How marvelous that you've finally found your level, practicing out of a toilet at the back of a cafe with a team of miscreants, myself included.
That's better.
I have to go home.
You're welcome to stay for supper.
Oh, thank you, but I need my bed.
Okay.
Well...
TARA:

Fancy room.

Wow!

-Ciao, bella.

Good tan.
You're more photogenic, so you should switch that around.
I think you should definitely switch that around!
-That's right.

Now, day one...
-Day one.

Yeah.
You've been working on your tan.
-Uh-huh.

No.

This is so lovely.

-I love you.

ERIC:

TARA:

-Can we please have food first?

TARA:
