My name is Detective Raimy Sullivan.
- My father was killed in 1996.

- Last night...

- WQ2YV...

- Hey.

- Your father?

So you're telling me that in 20 years,
I'm gonna be on the job with my daughter?
No.

[gunshot] [tires squeal] [gasps]
Dad survived, but saving his life changed everything.
We've ID'd the remains from the marsh.
I'm sorry, Raimy.

The most wanted serial killer in New York took my mom.
Now whatever we do, however we try to fix things, history keeps changing.
- Your name is Daniel Lawrence.

I'm your girlfriend.
I've never been to Queens, and I don't know you.
I'm sorry.
All I want is to get back what I lost.
Previously on "Frequency"...
- Where have you been?

This is a good thing, son.
Don't be sad.
We're gonna save her soul.
We're gonna give her a good death.
Meghan thinks that Joe killed her brother too.
- She's blaming herself.

'Cause that's what Meghan was trying to tell me, that the Deacon murdered her family, that he's the Nightingale.
You did it.

He even brought in souvenirs.
We found his wife's body exactly where he said it would be.
This is a slam-dunk case.

Why isn't mom back?
We don't know how this works.
Maybe it doesn't take effect right away.
Mom?
Shh, sorry.

What's with the gun?

Aww.
Mom?
Hey, sweetheart.
- [crying]

[laughs] Raims.
Aww, Raims, my sweet girl.
Is this a happy cry or a sad cry?
'Cause I got to get to work.
I'm not crying.
Okay, yeah, sure.

[crunches]
You did it.
- Hmm?

Yeah.

- [door opens]

We need to talk about ground rules for this engagement party, ASAP.
Nope.
No, no, no, no.

- Yes.

- Please.

Okay, ground rules.
There's three of them.

What are you wearing?
What?

Holy crap.

Ding, ding, ding.

Okay.
Number one.

Bump me.
Dude, you hate opening presents.
I know.
I just worked kind of hard for this particular party.
[sighs] Rookies.

Number two.

- Mm.

Who plays games at an engagement party?
My wife, her mom.

We spent the whole night doing shots in the bathroom.
- I do remember that.

Couples Memory Lane, Newlyweds.
That one's not so bad.
Are you kidding me?
Kidding me what?
Frickin' Newlyweds.
That's not so bad.
Mm.

I'm so exhausted, I'm gonna pass out in two minutes.
- No, don't be tired.

Number three...
Shut up, Gordo.
Hold on a second for real.
Now.
Mom's alive.
The Deacon's been in prison for 20 years.
No Nightingale kills since he was arrested.
And...
I'm getting married.
[gasps]
Whoa.
Yeah.
What?
Nothing.

It's hard to explain.
I was making you toads-in-a-hole this morning, kiddo.
And now...
How's your mother?
She's fine.
A doctor.
She did it?

I'm telling you.

I'm the one crying every 35 seconds and it's just another day to them.
No, that's a good thing, kiddo.
That's a real good thing.

That means we won.
Hey.

You, me, and your mom, we're gonna...
We're gonna go off the grid for a couple days.
You know, in case you're looking.
Where you headed?
[sighs] I don't know yet.
Johnny Dove's got this cabin by the lake that he keeps trying to rent out.
- So...

Yeah, well.
I, um, I just need some fresh air.
You might think about doing the same thing.
I'll do that.
Hey.
We got a problem.
Leah says I have to wear a jacket.
To what?
To your party.
With pretty boy.
- [laughs]

First of all, I know you want me to bite at that;

I'm in such a good mood, you can call him whatever you want.

Back?

Nowhere.

Yeah, you are in a good mood.
[chuckles] Look at that.
Haven't laid eyes on that one in years.
Yeah, Nightingale.

- I thought I'd learn from the best.

Me and your Pops.
That's some Greatest Hits action right there.
Oh, my God.
- What?

[laughs] Hey.

Study up, Junior.

Those women you killed.
I told them it was me.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're so young.
You can start over...
I don't know if I can stop.
These women, they call out to me.
- So we pray.

That doesn't help me, every day, with all of the sin I see.
I know it's hard.
And all those mementos you left me?
I'm so proud.
But no one else is gonna understand what you did.
You're gonna tell me the details of each and every kill.
And you're never gonna look back.
- [horns honk] - [chuckles] Great.
That's great news.
- All right, I'll check you later.

Deacon Joe's attorney just informed the DA that he's bringing a signed confession from his client detailing the name and location of every single one of his victims.
All of them?

Actually, yeah.
So you got another one right, hotshot.
Come on.

What do you say about going solo on this one?
I was gonna take Jules and Raims away.
Do some of that family bonding you've been meemaw-ing me about.
[laughs] So things are working out, huh?
Yeah, you know, One day at a time.
That's good, Frank.
That's real good.
Did you get out today, Pop?
You can't sit at that table all day.
You got to move.
You got to move.

You hear me?
And you got to eat the food that Mary puts out for you.
She's a good cook, Pop.
- She costs too much.

Now, don't you worry about that, all right?
I got a good job now; it pays good money so people like Mary can look after your old bones.
Hey, remember you used to chase after me on the boulevard?
Thought I'd end up like Manny and T?
Little Stanny did good, right, Pop?
Because you're dirty.
What?
Tell me.
Grandpop killed women, Dad.
He was the Nightingale Killer.
You think they wouldn't find out, 'cause it's a new school?
Did you fight back?
- Was he supposed to just stand there, Rob?

Hey.
Hey.
I get it.

- [sobs]

But who grandpa is or was, that's not who we are.
And fighting back?
I know how good that feels.
But violence, violence of any kind?
Not who we are either.
Do you understand me?
Yes, sir.
- Come here.

[grille clattering] [woman screaming distantly]
[pages rustling] [woman screaming distantly]
[cell phone rings]
Hi, Ma, I'm outside.
Sorry.

Or maybe I should have paged...
Doctor.
I'll see you in a sec.
[engine revs] [tires squeal]
It's awesome!
Careful!
What's gonna get her?
I don't know.
Bears?
If we're lucky?
[grunts]
You keep an eye on peanut.

You think we're staying for two weeks or what?
Maybe.

[indistinct chatter]
Can you run a plate for me real quick?
I promise it's the last thing I'll ever ask.
4, Nancy, tango, 0, 7, 7, 6.
Car's registered to a Doris Perkins.
Address here in Scarsdale.
[computer chimes]
[knocks at door]
Got a sec?
What's up?
Oh.

You found a chink in the Nightingale case?
You want to reopen the whole thing?
- Tear down my legacy?

No, no.

You're welcome.
No, I'm running down something else.
This red truck.
It's registered to a Doris Perkins.
Does that ring any bells from the Nightingale days?
Uh, there was a blue pickup truck.
With a camper shell.

And what makes you think it's connected to the Nightingale?
It's connected to something.

Would you like to talk it through?
Not yet.
I'd just sound like a crazy person at this point.
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
[cell phone rings]
Miracella.
Now's not a great time.
I don't hate you, Frank.
I hated what happened to us, but...
I don't hate you.
I can't.
And before things get any crazier, I just wanted you to know that.
Far as I'm concerned, you and I are square.
I appreciate that.
But, uh, you mind telling me how things are gonna get crazier?
Come on, Frank.
It's a crazy world.

I just wanted you to know that you don't have to worry 'bout me anymore.
'Bout any of it.
Okay.
I'm happy for you, Frank.
I am.
[sniffles] [clears throat]
Hey.
Hi.
- Thanks.

- [bottles clink]

[sighs]
And only you would know that she would love this.
Come on.

You know, I'll admit.

I was standing here thinking that same exact thing.
[doorbell rings]
Hi.
Raimy Sullivan, NYPD.
Robbie Womack.
I'm sorry I didn't realize who you were.
I remember your dad.
And I sort of remember coming to your house when you were a kid, but... that time's kind of a blur for me.
I understand.
You said that truck outside is actually yours?
Yeah.
Well, it's registered to my mother-in-law.
Doris Perkins.
I work for her landscaping business.
It's a company car.
Is there a problem?
We're looking into a hit-and-run fatality in the area and checking trucks that match the description.
Can you tell me where you went today?
Yeah.
Uh...
I had a job in the morning.
Then I went to the hospital.
Center Street.
I was visiting my sister.
Your sister, Meghan?
Yeah.
[indistinct chatter] [claps] Okay, ladies, are we gonna fire up these hot dogs or what?
- [knock at door]

[laughs]
Ah, no, you didn't!
You know you can't get the party started without friends.
Oh, you got me!
What's up, fella?
- How you doing?

- Welcome to the place.

It's crazy, ain't it,
- how things turn around?

You know, a few days ago, I could see a world where the Nightingale case just swallowed me up.
Leah never seeing me, the kids...
You really drove the bus on this one.
Yeah.
Me and Jules, we were, uh... hurtin' for a while there too, you know?
You know, I'm sorry I didn't back you up, with Stan.
I just couldn't see a way out.
Man, we... we've both done things we're not proud of.
- Right?

But, hey, life's too short.
You know, look at it.
It's too good.
- Let's just put it behind us, you know.

Move on.
Hey, kids, who's ready for some s'mores?
- [laughs]

- Here you go, Raims.

Guys be careful, okay?
I remember that night.
Solomon and I ate about 47 marshmallows
- and froze our asses off.

You loved every minute of it.
You went all Frances Farmer on us when we wouldn't let you sleep out by the fire.
Listen, Dad.

I ran into Robbie Womack.
We never killed the Deacon.
We never cut off the trunk.
What if the branches are starting to grow back...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

What exactly happened?
Okay, the night I drove up to the cabin, when Robbie was stabbed...

I saw the same red truck yesterday.
It was Robbie's.
He was visiting Meghan at Mom's hospital.
Now, that's not a coincidence, that's fate, Dad.
- It's happening again...

Raimy, it can't be.
Okay, Deacon Joe's in prison.
There hasn't been a murder in 20 years.
Robbie lied to me.
He told me he was going to the cabin that night to see Meghan, but he was following me.
What, now I bump into him?
Something is going on.
Why else would I be seeing ghosts from that timeline when mom was killed?
Look, Raims, every time I close a case,
I see ghosts for years... witnesses, the sister of a suspect in the supermarket... it doesn't mean anything.
You need to go see Robbie and Meghan.
- And say what?

But we must have missed something.
This all just happened the last two days.
I'm just asking you to make sure it's buttoned up.
Okay.
Okay, I'll go see 'em, okay, for you.
But... you got to do something for me, please?
What is it?
You got your mom back, your fiancé.
Now, let me handle this.
Okay, you go be with them.
You did it, kiddo.

[door opens]
Hi.
Can you sit down for a second?

Okay.
That doesn't sound good.
Yeah, no, I've been meaning to bring it up for a while;
it just, um, always seemed like a bad time.
If you're about to tell me there's someone else,
- I'm gonna kill you.

God, no.

Okay, that sounded...
Uh...
Just say it.
Look.
I respect your privacy, I really do.
You know, this is the rest of our lives.
And...
I need to know that we can be open about everything.
Yeah.
Who's the man you've been talking to on the ham?
Two months ago, your birthday, you said that you spoke to your dead father on the ham.
[water splashes]
I also told you I was stressed out about a case;
- I wasn't sleeping.

So who've you been talking to ever since?
I want to be open with you about everything.
But what if I asked you to trust me, that there was a reasonable explanation, but I can't tell you.
And you'd never tell me.
I don't think I could.
Now, the worst is over.
You're both safe, okay?
But I'm not gonna lie; the trial is gonna get pretty personal, invasive.
Now, I'm gonna need to know that you're both up to this.
We've been waiting for this since we were kids.
I can do it.
Okay, this is gonna be especially hard for you, Rob.
Being the sole witness to your mother's murder, to any of the murders... you are the linchpin here, okay?
So I'm gonna need you to be able to get up on that stand and tell the truth.
Can you do that?

Yeah.
He needs to pay for what he did.
And is there anything else that you're not telling us, anything you didn't tell the DA about Joe, about your mother's murder?
Because any surprises in trial could jeopardize putting Joe away for life.
No.
Nothing.
Okay.
Okay.
It's gonna be okay.
I promise.
[knocks]
Hi, I'm Dr. Julie Sullivan.
Dr. Li was called away on a family emergency, and I'll be covering for him for the next few days.
And now Meghan has a new doctor, Julie Sullivan.
It's the same woman I tried to save 20 years ago.
I think it's a sign.
I need to start my work again.
And I saw her daughter too.
Are you insane?
I've been rotting in this hole for the last 20 years.
For you.
You don't understand.
Julie said the cancer's spread all over Meghan.
It's in her lungs, in her liver, her bones.
Well, is she ready?
Is Meghan's soul ready?
Are you listening to me?
Julie Sullivan was standing...
Hey.
...right in front of me,
These women are sinners, even if they don't know it.
And I don't think I can stop,
- not without Meghan.

So you need to think about your family, everything that you've built.
I'm trying.
I can't lose her.
I died for you.
And you're telling me it's too hard for you to be free?
Giving thanks to our Father, who has made you fit...
And sharing in the inheritance of the holy ones in the light.
[indistinct chatter] [laughs]
- What's up, man?

Some of the guys are talking about moving camp over to Dooley's.
No, you go ahead.
I'm gonna watch the Jets highlights and head home.
No, no, no, you're the man of the year here.
Ah, come on, you know how I hate being in the middle of those things.
Besides, it feels good to just sit here.
Be normal.
And, hey, I take my eyes off the Jets, and their season's a disasterpiece.
- So I got to, you know...

All right, man.

- Be safe tonight.

Everything's coming up Sullivan, huh?
Cheers.
Why don't you keep drinking, Stan?
[grunts, sighs]
I told myself it wasn't personal, what happened at the shipyard...
Nah, why would it be?
Just trying to blow a guy's head off.
You know, there was a time I wondered,
"Am I a cop, or am I a janitor just cleaning out the gutters?"
I see these dealers in their high-rise pads, and...

"Why should they have more?
Why should my family have less"
You know?
You're kidding me, right?
Yeah, maybe you are on the wrong side.
Because you, you're so clean.
You got that sparkle.
[sighs]
I know you kidnapped the Deacon.
I talked to Julie's cousin with the auto body shop.
Set you up with a loaner while he fixed the one you took from the motor pool.
[chuckles]
So what, you're gonna jam up the case?
The Nightingale?
You were gonna put a bullet in the Deacon's head.
Hey, I get it.
He's taking nurses, Julie's a nurse, somebody touches what's yours, you hit back.
You and I, we're not that different, Frank.
And you think this...

I think the real bad guys are out there.
And that you and I, we know how to take care of 'em.
That's what I think.
We live three blocks from each other.
We were never friends.
I couldn't tell Daniel the truth.
What if it changed something?
You did the right thing, Raims.
We can't risk it.
What if he can't live with it?
I know I couldn't, not forever.
Maybe it's not forever.
I, um...
I talked to Meghan and Robbie about the case.
We went over it.

Look, Raims, we could sit here and drive ourselves crazy for the rest of our lives.
You know, chasing ghosts, seeing signs in the wind but...
We need to make sure Mom's safe.
I know that.
Raims, we got the Nightingale.

Maybe we need to stop poking at what we already have before it breaks again.
What are you saying?
You don't think we should talk about this stuff anymore or you don't think we should talk at all?
Something to think about.
Look, Dad, we haven't really talked about this, but you're not here now.
You died in a car accident five years ago.
Okay.
But, um... your mom is.
You already saved me, Raimy.
I got everything that I've ever wanted.
I got... you.
I got your mother.
And we're good now.
We're a family.

You should be here with us now.
We can stop the accident.
We're not gonna decide anything tonight.
I don't want to give up on this either.
'Cause I don't know what I would do without you.
You do have me, Dad.
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
I don't know if I can do it, Meg:
get up in court and say Joe's a monster.
Robbie,
I know it's scary.
But he can't touch us.
And think about Mom.
But he's not a monster.
[scoffs]
I'm not a monster.
Those women needed to be saved.
So Aunt Irene is gonna make the wedding after all.
What?
You just seem pissed or about to cry.

It was a total crap day at work, hon.
Well, we have about 1,100 bottles of booze here.
Where do you want to start?
I, uh...
I had to tell a patient that she wasn't gonna make it.
She's younger than I am.
And the worst thing is, this woman and her brother, they've had so much tragedy in their lives already.
I loved Mom.

She was never home.
She was going to hell, Meg.
- Joe had to save her.

I couldn't understand it either, not for a long time.
Until I started seeing Larissa.
Larissa?
It was that summer up at camp.
Joe had already sent you away,
I was totally alone.
We'd sneak away to see each other at night, even after the summer.
I thought Larissa was my salvation.
You slept with her?
Robbie, you were 15...
I loved her.
But she cheated on me.
She was a whore, just like Mom.
What kind of tragedy?
You won't remember this, hon, but this woman she actually stayed with us when you were a kid.
Meghan Womack.
Yeah.
She's your patient?
The only way to save them from their sins was to give them a good death.
I gave them all a good death.
You... [sighs]
You killed Larissa?
I swear to you, it was a good thing, Meg.
I saved their souls.
[quietly] Oh, my god.
All those women?
I have to go.
- No.

- Stop.

I washed them in holy water.

Stop!

This can't be a coincidence.
I mean, what about Meghan's stepdad?

Did she say anything about him?
Who's Meghan?
Meghan Womack, your patient.
I don't have a patient named Meghan.
Mom, are you high?

We were just talking about getting more champagne.
You said Gordo could pick it up.
- Frank.

Frank, are you there?
Dad!
[phone rings]
Oh, sorry.

- Hello.

I need to talk to you.
Something's gone really bad.
Okay, where are you?
[sobs] My apartment.
I'll be right there.
Um...

Something just came up with a witness.
I got to go check on him.
But I promise you guys it won't take long.
Save me a piece. [smooches]
Hey, and, Raims, put back the spare key.
I didn't take it!
[knocking at door]
Robbie?
Robbie, it's Frank!
Robbie?
_
Meghan was Robbie's last victim.
And we never found him.
No.

He's been in prison for the last 20 years.
Yes, for the murder of his wife.
What about the other women...

He turned himself in.

Yeah, that was crazy.
The guy tried to take the rap for his stepson.
It turned out the kid witnessed his mom's murder and killed four other women the same way.
Rosaries, holy water;

Then he finished with his sister.
How do you know Robbie's finished?
How do we know?
Because he stopped.
He hasn't been active for 20 years.
He's not done.
It's happening, now.

- Raimy!

Stan, it's Frank!

Deacon Joe is not the Nightingale.

He's going after Jules, and she's not answering the phone.
Units are on their way, but you see this kid, you stop him, any means necessary.
You hear me?
I'm there.
[gunshots] [grunts]
That was for my brother and my mom.

You know what?

I just been sitting out here guarding that spot for half an hour.
I'm sorry.

Seriously?

- That's nice, Raim.

You okay?
CQ, CQ.
We're trying to reach the Space Shuttle "Atlantis."
Or anybody.
All right, you little space cadets.
Dinner is served.
Ta-da!
Did you both do your homework?
No food till you do your homework...
- What?

Robbie.
Everything okay?
Hey, hey!

- Leah.

- [laughs]

Need to talk?
We should have eloped.
Mom.
Hey-hey!
Listen.

What's going on?
Nothing.
- Just promise me, okay?

How can I help you, honey?
You can't help me.
I'm here to help you.
Oh, god.
CQ?
CQ?
Dad, are you there?
- Dad, I need to talk to you.

- Daddy's friend.

What do you mean you're here to help me, Robbie?
He's the Nightingale, Julie.

He's the Nightingale, and he is there to take you.
I'm gonna ask again.

I don't know.

Your name is Robbie Womack.
Your father confessed to crimes he didn't commit because you did, didn't you?
You killed those women.
Somebody tell her to shut up.
You killed Larissa Abbot and Carmen Salinas.
I don't think you're the Nightingale, Robbie.
I know it was you.

Okay, I think you're a sweet kid.
You're a confused kid who I tried to help.
Let me help you, honey.
Hey, Gordo!
[gunshots]
[Julie and kids screaming]
No, no, no, no!

What did you do?
What did you do?
It's me who you want, right?

Take me, okay?

Do not hurt these kids, Robbie.
Don't.

I am going to find you.
And I am going to kill you.

I will not give you a good death.
It will be a very, very bad death when I find you.
[electrical humming] [crashing, electricity zapping]

No, no, no.
