Lucy, my dear.
If you need anything, call me and I'll be here in an instant.
Here, that should take care of the pregnancy.
Hi, I'm rosemund, but everybody calls me rosey.
- You're an artist.

- Can I see what you're doing?

Aw, come on!

Are you like really upset or something?
It's cool though, I like it.
A little giraffe.
- Gosh, is that your room?

- It's awesome.

Oh, my god.
This is the coolest house I have ever seen.
It's my home.
Wow.
But it's yours.
Which means i can give it to you.
Hey, I don't, you didn't tell me your name.
I'm Lucy.
Lucy, cool.
I cannot believe I let you and David talk me into this.
Oh, you've come a long way since the Agnes croft school for girls, huh?
Okay, here we go.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to introduce the guest of honor for this evening,
Ms. Lucy moon.
It's nights like these that really show that the Gulf coast is becoming a cultural center now.
And we want to, really on behalf of all of us, welcome you, and world class artist Lucy moon, and your son David moon.
Well, thank you.

It's good to be home.
I wanted to ask you.
Do you think that your son's live streaming project is kind of taking away from the artists, and the work they're doing here?
Well, David moon has just joined the show, and it looks like it's going to be some night.
You know judging by the crowd's reaction tonight,
I think you're right.
Hey, mom.
For god's sake, David.
What, why can't you understand that I have my own talents?
Huh?

I don't understand why you can't manage to conduct yourself in a manner of which I can be proud.
Oh, I see.
You know, you really should have just given me up for adoption when you had the chance.
'Cause that would've saved you so much time and energy.
If these people only knew that you are just as great of a mother as you are as an artist.
God, you'd be a smash.
Ah, okay, okay.

Rosey, rosey, I am on top of the world.
Oh, I know you are, honey.
Just try to keep it together, okay?
Okay.
Move.
I would like to thank you all for coming out tonight to give Lucy and David moon a genuine,
Mississippi Gulf coast welcome.
Um, the gallery will be officially open in just 10 minutes, where you can all view, for the first time ever, "dark exposure".
Alongside David moon's ground-breaking multi-media production, "hidden perspectives"
which will give an entirely new ambiance to our delicious Mississippi coastline.
Thank you all again for coming.

Don't worry about it.

Where the hell is David?

Makes me want to blow something else.
You are so bad.
In a really good way.
I know, that's why i keep you around.
I'm kidding, it's a joke.
It's a joke, it's a joke.
Could I please get everyone's attention?
Hi, I just wanted to thank you all for being such great supporters for the gallery.
Um, in just a few minutes you will get your reward.
And in the meantime please, feel free to walk around and enjoy the works of all our other wonderful artists.
And just remember to smile, as David says the entire world will be watchin'.
Okay, thank you all again.
I saw him go upstairs with that Connie Lee girl.
- What else is new?

Son of a bitch, I am not covering for you anymore.
I'm sorry, any more?
You never did, asshole.
I take care of myself, okay?
I always have, I always will.
So I think I'll be just fine without you and mommy dearest looking out after me.
Why thank you so much for your mock concern.
Fuck you, Austin.
No, fuck David.
Good evening, uncle Walter.
Good evenin'.

Oh, sounds lively.
Welcome everyone to my fantastic mother, who's always been so supportive of me's art show.
Art opening.
She looks absolutely resplendent.
Here's some of her pieces.
Earlier works, that she did.
That one's particularly hideous.
Ah, we can move past here.
Ah, through here.
Ah, and then we will come to these.
These are her earlier sketches, where she...
Well, David seems to have found his metier...
Vocation.
Thanks, I know what metier means.
Well, let's hope you can find something someday.
And this is the biggest anticipation of the night.
The work that she's been painting for many, many months.
"Dark exposure".
Mm.

Aw, and your presence is the icing on the cake.
And that dress.
Come in girl sizes?
I'm so proud of you.
Thank you, honey.
Not really my scene.
I saw what I came for, thank you.
Hmm.
Shit, David, come on.
Hello, world.

- What do we got?

- I think they're ready for you.

- All right.

Thank you.
Hey, Eddie, so what you have so far?
Name's David moon.
Some kind of new media, YouTube big shot.
- I don't know.

Kid's not twenty-five.
Shit.

Owner of the gallery, rosemund Wallace.
No priors, no husband, boyfriend, no girlfriend.
That's always good to know.
Hey, Mike, get a closer look at this painting, will ya?
And tell me if you don't think that's a little strange.
Yeah, it is.
Well, fellini would've been proud, huh?
Who?
Ms. Wallace?

Do you mind if I ask you some questions?
Yeah.
Did you know the young man?
Since he was born.
I'm sorry.
He had his problems, but he was a good kid and a great talent.
He...
He didn't deserve this.
Did he ever speak to you about being unhappy?
Maybe, maybe hurting himself?
David was Lucy moon's son.
We just had this celebration of a lifetime to honor their work.
There's, there's no way David just committed suicide.
Okay.
Oh, how am I gonna tell Lucy?
Yes, Ms. Wallace.

No, no, no, no, no, I'll go.
Okay.
Ms. Wallace, are you sure you want to do this?
She's my best friend.
Okay.
Rosemund, what a nice surprise.
Hi, Lucy.
Um, this is detective mavredes.
- Ms. moon.

Uh, we have something we need to tell you.
Well, what is it?

Ms. moon, it might be best if we go inside.
No, tell me now, here.
Ms. moon, I'm so very sorry to tell you this.
Today we discovered you son's body in the Wallace gallery.
I don't know what happened back there.
It's understandable.
How do we find who did this?
That's what I'm going to try and find out.
Hey, rosey, go home, okay?
I can do this, you need to get some rest.
I need to keep busy.

Look at this.
Here, give it to me.

Oh, no, you're fine.
I'll give it to detective mavredes.
Hey, Ms. Wallace.

Great, go give him a hand.

Good to see you.
We're all looking forward to your show.
Thank you.
These are just wonderful.
Yes, ma'am.
They just wash up on the shore and I find them.
Maybe you could come with me sometime, I'll show you.
I would love that.
Thank you.
- They're, uh, so crude.

Well, I mean look at them.
They're just completely lacking in sophistication.
It's precisely the lack of sophistication that makes his work so appealing.
There's a rawness, a certain primal quality to them.
You cannot be serious.
You...
You're the only gallery in town that has the balls to showcase real work.
- Yeah.

This...

Not for your fuckin' 15 bucks an hour.
- That's enough, Austin.

You don't look at my photographs for what, ever?
And then this guy comes in off the street with some driftwood shit and you just can't wait to showcase him.
Yeah, thanks.
Fuck!
You are an artist.
You are an artist.
You are an artist.
You are an artist.
See, wood's got to be strong and have just the right amount of twist.
So that there's a head or tail...
Or even a wing.
Now what kind of animal do you think that is?
Look at the eye.

I'm sorry, i just don't see it.
That's 'cause you ain't used to seeing the world that exists between ours and the next.
It's a place that can only be seen in here.
And you just ain't been taught how to look yet.
Now, looka here.
See?

And over here, coming up out the sea.
- That's his head.

It's a shark!
And he's right there that whole time.
All you need to do to see it was to start using this.
Come on, sit down over there.
Oh, this is nice, Mayo.
There's a certain crowd on the coast.
A men's only set.
Money, connections, real, real private.
Like to throw quiet gatherings.
Parties with young, creative guys.
Well, the boy was with them sometimes.
Wasn't no women at these parties, ma'am.
Are you trying to say David was gay?
All I know for sure was that the boy was with a lot heavy hitters.
One in particular is from the governor's office.
His name is James Travers.
You go to these parties, Mayo?
No, ma'am.
I'm afraid I wouldn't be invited.
But I know somebody who would.
I'll take you to meet him when the time is right.
What's the surprise?
Come here, come here.
I want to show you something.

These yours?
Nice composition.
I like the lighting in this one.
Okay, listen, listen.

All right, but I think that these can be shown.
They're wonderful, really.
So you'll exhibit them?
I'll give it serious consideration.
Don't knock yourself out with compliments, rosey.
Austin, I do think your work is good.
I just don't know if you're breaking any new ground.
Yes, I am!

This is unique, this is original.
That's enough.
Why don't you clean this up and we'll discuss it later?
Once you've calmed down and I'm a bit less preoccupied.
- No, really, Austin.

You need to free your mind of all this turmoil.
Why don't you peruse my portfolio for awhile?
It always cheers me up to look at pictures of men.
Oh, Bernard.
In suits, plus, a good stiff one never hurt either.
- You are no lady.

- Chin.

Mm, that is good, honey.
Mm-hmm, my one true talent.
Bernard, who is this?
Signet ring, I've seen it someplace before.
No, you don't want to bother with that.
Why, who is he?
James Travers, one of those government big wigs.
In love with himself, just like the rest of them.
Yeah, well?
I mean, he sat with you for the length of an entire portrait.
Surely you can tell me a little bit more about him.
Well, he squirmed the whole time.
Just like a wriggly little snake.
Now I hardly find it necessary to remember those who are not well-mannered, nor fun.
Introduce me to him.
Well, unfortunately Mr. Travers and I have lost contact.
Oh.
Oh, well fine, I will be using your name though when I call his office.
Oh, thank you.

Good, since I've got you in a lucid moment.
Hmm?
What do you know about high roller soirees here on the coast?
The kind I wouldn't be invited to.
Why, because you're an art dealer?
- Because you're a democrat?

Honey, you can't be serious about meeting that man.
Oh, I'm serious as sin, honey.

This is hopeless.
Excuse me, what are you doing?
I came to get some things.
There's nothing of yours here, so please leave 'cause I got to open up soon.
Look, I know you don't think much of me.
But I loved David, and I did everything for him.
Connie Lee, this is not the time.
Things I'm sure you wouldn't approve of.
Look, I'm sorry.

You can't stand the idea that someone was as important to him as you were.
He was like a son to me.
David could never be happy.
He only wanted attention from one person and that was his mother.
Okay, I think you've said enough.
Would you please leave?
David didn't kill himself.

Austin, honey.
Rosey, listen I'm so sorry about yesterday.
I just really wanted to show you my art, and my passion got the better of me.
No, no, no, don't even worry about it.
I wanted to talk, you know we...
We never even talked about what happened.
You okay?
About David, it's a terrible thing.
Yeah.
But, I mean, it's not completely unexpected, right?
Excuse me, what?
- I mean, you had to know.

He was coked out of his mind like all the time.
That girlfriend of his, Connie Lee...
That's no way to talk about David.
My god, you didn't know.
You didn't...

You know what, you're right.

Life goes on.
Well, I'm not going to stop until I found out what happened that night.
You know, it's a suicide, right?
No, it was not.
Leave the police work to the police, rosey.
Yeah, well the police aren't doing a god damn freakin' thing.
Hi.
Ms. Wallace, you okay?
Yeah, I want to talk to you about David's murderer.
Yeah, I know he was murdered.
- What are you doing about it?

Look me in the eyes and tell me you're doing everything you can to find David's killer.
Ms. Wallace, we don't even know yet if there is a David's killer.
The investigation will prove that.
- Then I guess I'm on my own.

Why don't you stay and have a drink?
We can talk about it.
Thank you.
Like a drink?
I'm fine, thanks.
So I know you run the gallery.
Tell me something about yourself.
You first.
You're not going to make this easy, are you?
Okay, uh, I'm a local boy.
I was a prom king, a football star, you know usual superman stuff.
Now I'm slinging' a badge.
You?
I moved to New York to be close to Lucy.
She needed someone to help her with David.
I graduated college with a major in art, but I had no talent.
So I became a curator.
Suffered through the usual depressing ups and downs of career and romance.
You don't want to hear all about that.
No doubt, I hear you.
I just didn't like it there, so I came to the Gulf.
Heard people were friendly here.
They are.
I'm going to do everything i can on this case and get you as much information as I can, I promise.
- Thank you.

I have to go.
Let me know if you hear anything.
- I will.

Oh, I found this ring on the floor of the gallery.
I don't know who it belongs to.
I'll be sure to look into it for you.
Hey, con.
John.
Yeah, it's me.
Imagine that.
This... this is a nice bike.
Going on a trip?
Figure I'd head to New Orleans for a couple days, clear my head.
David, you know.
Yeah, that was...

Such a talent.
We are all going to miss him.
Thing is, con... before you go... you've got something of mine.
John, I went back to the gallery to try and find it.
I figured David had stashed it somewhere, but when I went in there the owner came in and chased me out.

The owner, huh?
Connie... why did you have to fuck up so bad?
Hey!
Get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away!
Beverly, it's me.

I just want to know what you saw.
Just tell me what you saw.
What I did see.

What I did see about the fancy man.
What fancy man?
That man has a fancy suit and a fancy car and he was in a very big hurry that night.
- That night that that boy...

That night that that boy...

Okay, okay, tell me exactly what you saw.
Okay, I did, i did see that boy.
I did see that boy...

He was doing things...

And... and then I couldn't...

That boy didn't have all the lights on.
He didn't turn on all the lights.
So and then the fancy man comes.
That fancy man comes...

They, they, they what?
They what?

They hugged, they were hugging for a very long time.
And then I couldn't see anymore.
I didn't...
Tell me whatever you can about him, whatever you can.
Whatever you remember.
I did see the license tag.
I did see that.
Do you remember what it was?
There was a state, state car m-m-k-m-m-m-k-m-two-two-one.
M-k-m-two-two-one, m-k-m-two-two-one.
Okay, thank you, okay, m-k-m-two-two-one.
- I remember that one.

I remember that one.
Hey.
- I got your call.

You know Beverly, the homeless lady?
Mm-hmm.
She saw something that night.
- What do you mean?

Here's the license plate.
Um... it had a state seal on it.
You think you could look into that for me?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
It's beautiful here.
Yeah, it is.
David's mother, how's she doin'?
She won't talk to me.

Seems like no matter what I do,
I'm losing everyone i care about.
No, no.
Look, you can't blame yourself for any of this, rose.
You married?
Was.
Prom queen?
Something like that.
Didn't work out.
What about you?
No, no, it's another thing I'm not good at.
You know, when I was a kid my mom used to send me to my daddy's girlfriend's house.
Bring him back home for dinner.
What chance did I have?
- Scarred for life, huh?

Stay right here, okay?
- You wait here, okay?

How you doin', man?

Good to see you.
Take care of her.
I got rosemund our there.
Come on.
Thank you.
- Mm.

Ms. Wallace, what a pleasure to see you.
- Oh, likewise.

Thank you.
Can I get you a cocktail?
Oh, a gin Martini with an olive, please.
I'm so sorry to be disturbing your meal.
Not at all, not at all.
What a beautiful ring.
Oh, hmm.
- Family crest?

Well, I think congratulations are in order for the Lucy moon gala.
Oh, regrettably the event was marred by the death of that poor boy.
Yes, losing David broke my heart.
I'm so sorry.

Thank you, sir.
I read somewhere that he was a promising media artist.
Which is why I would never believe he committed suicide.
Right.
Rosemund, may i call you rosemund?
Please.
Could we just lay this aside just for the moment?
It's so sad, so dreadful.
Now, I understand you're preparing to showcase Mayo's work.
Oh, I love what he does.
Oh, well, Mayo Johnson's a very lucky man.
I'm not totally unaware of your reputation.
It seems you have a discerning eye for discovering young talent.
- Thank you.
Um...
To be candid, I didn't come here to discuss Mayo's work.
Although, at another time, it would give me great pleasure.
Really?
Yes.
Then why are we here?
James Travers.
The scoundrel that sits on the right hand of our illustrious governor who uses a facade of power to impress and elicit certain favors from young men.
Seems you have an almost intimate familiarity with him.
Well, this is Mississippi.
Oh, yes.
Mayo seems to think that David and Travers knew each other.
Now I was hoping you might be able to help me get to the bottom of this.
Trust me, I will get to the bottom of this.
If Travers had anything to do with David moon's death, believe you me, justice will be swift.
I can assure you of that.
Oh, my, as one gets older the hands of time do most inexorably quicken their pace.
I wonder what Mr. Einstein would have to say about that?
Hm?
Well, can I say goodbye?
I hope we meet again.
You better stay close.
I might need you later.
Yes, sir.
- Hi.

- Hey.

- Yeah.

Can I have coffee, black please?

You know, I could get fired for this.
But before you look at it, it's not nice, okay?
It's a brand.
We found it on David's thigh.
Oh, my god.
Medical examiner says it's been there a week, two at most.
There's something familiar about the shape.
What do you mean?
Reminds me of the ring I gave you.
The one I found at the gallery.
The inscription.

Walter mcgowan was wearing.
Dr. mcgowan?
Yes, I had drinks with him last night.
Rose, have you been playing detective again?
No.

Okay, look, I'll get one of my lab guys to look into it.
Also, that plate you wanted me to run.
Says that it was a state motor pool vehicle.
So we'll work out who was driving it that night.
I know it was Travers.
Rose, you can't just make assumptions like that.
You're going to find yourself in court.
- You've got to be patient.

I know.
Look, what do you say we, uh, we get out of here.
I'll take you home.

Check, please.
Rose, it's me.
I got some bad news.
Rosemund, you have visitors.
- What the hell's that?

Do you want me to get that?
No, no, no, no, I'll get it.
Bernard, hi.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Travers.
Thank you so much for taking the time
- while you're down here on the coast.

And I must say, you are as handsome as your portrait.
- What portrait?

And I was so taken with that beautiful ring you were wearing.
I have several.
This Mayo fella is terrific.
Lord of the woods indeed.
Lord of the woods?
- Heard of lord of the flies?

It's lord of the woods.
That's just how the artist refers to himself.
He feels his calling is to find life, you know, give life to orphan drift wood.
What makes Mayo's work so special is that he finds the drift wood, and sees the animal in it.
Huh.
Then he simply paints what he sees.
Well, I'm not really much of an art lover.
It's more of the governor and his wife's thing.
So why don't you just show me what you recommend.
It's interesting, but a little dark.
Not really the governor's taste, I'm afraid.
Oh, I'm sorry, i was thinking of you.
I thought it would be right up your alley.
- What do you mean?

The red rope, the black plastic.
Why do I get a feeling this little field trip was simply a pretext?
You were the last person to see David moon alive.
You know, wild imagination's no defense against slander.
I'm going to have to remember to thank Bernard for this little adventure.
You were here that night.
You want to be careful, Ms. Wallace.
You don't know who you're dealing with.
You take care now.
Oh, you, too.
Ah, well, I'm glad to see they looked after you.
Oh, yeah, thanks.
Well, there is somethin' i need you to listen to.
Oh, all right.
You want to be careful, Ms. Wallace.
You don't know who you're dealing with.
Now I'm telling you, this is our guy.
I know, but this is not enough to convene a grand jury.
Now, I'll get my contacts and I'll try to get more information, all right?
Well, here, down the hatch.
Mm!
Thank you.
Mm, ah, mm.

Enjoy your day.
Travers threatened me.

- Oh, my god.

I... when I was cleaning up the mess at the gallery,
I found a ring that had an inscription on it.
The same inscription that was on Travers' ring in your portrait.
They both look exactly like a brand they found on David's leg.
A brand?
Now that I think about it, mcgowan's ring had the same inscription.
What?
Nothin', nothin' just...

- He was not at the opening.

So, he lost his ring the night he killed David.
Rosemund, do you know how many people wear signet rings?
Not with that symbol.

Yes, that you are trying to ruin me.
What?
Honey, don't you remember, i introduced you two.
He's going to think I'm all caught up in this madness, that I, that I set him up.
Bernard... we've been friends for years.
I know when you are hiding something from me.
Oh, hell.
The inscription on that ring is a symbol of the order.
A very private and extremely powerful men's organization.
Its members provide unswerving support for its members' business and political agendas.
What about personal?
That, too.
And one way to insure a profitable future is to recruit young, fresh talent.
And that's where the parties come in handy.
It was the practice of the order to invite promising young men to certain gatherings.
As part of a selection process.
They were social events where the members had a chance to get acquainted with the hopefuls.
But at a point, the gatherings began to take on a sharp edge of competitiveness.
On one occasion the vying actually turned violent.
Now this kind of behavior is in complete contradiction to the order,
- and abhorrent to it's members.
Except for a small circle who seemed to encourage it.
This inner group went so far in their dark behavior, as to eventually mark their own flesh with a brand in the shape of the order's symbol.
And among the most prominent was James Travers.
Word began to spread that he and his little group were making promises of membership, and career favors to some of the susceptible youth in exchange for pharmaceutical and sexual services.
I am so sorry that you had to hear this from me.
Would you come outside with me for a second?
I think I need to get some fresh air.
Shit.

I don't know why he never listened to me.
I'll go check the fuse box, you yell when the lights come on, okay?
- I am coming with you.

Bernard, you got somethin?
Shhh, shhh, shhh.
Bernard is napping and unless you want to join him
I suggest you hand over my money.
What?

I don't know what you're talking about.
Let me elucidate.

Connie said you have the cash Davey got for my product.
I told you, I don't...

Think again.

Okay, okay.

It's upstairs...

That's more like it.
I'm a little pressed for time here.
Where the fuck is it?
Open it!

What the fuck is this?

Police, hands!
- Let her go.

It's over.
Put the gun down, detective.

Or cross my heart, I will cut this bitch where she stands.
Attaboy.
Over here.

I'll be right back, don't worry.
- Keep an eye on him, okay?

Thank you.
Hey, baby, come on, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
- Sorry.

I'm sorry I didn't keep you safe.
I thought he was going to kill me.
No, no.

No one's going to hurt you again.
You hear me?

Yeah, hi, Jim.
Sit down.

How's Betsy?
Well, she's good, Walter.

Yeah, we've had a few newsworthy events around the Gulf area here.
- Mm-hmm.

Yes, sir.
I was assessing some art for the governor's new office.
Hm...
Where would that be?
At the Wallace gallery.
You know they specialize in local artists.
Oh, yeah, the Wallace...
Isn't that the place where that young boy hanged himself?
I believe it is.
Hm.
You know anything about that boy?
- No, sir.

A little wine?
So you telling me that he never attended any of your special parties?
I beg your pardon.
Aw, Jesus, don't be coy with me.
You know perfectly well what I'm talking about!
You can save us a lot of time, just tell me the connection you have to David.
You know, Walter, sometimes I have to do certain things for the governor's special guests.
Maybe that's what you're referring to.
Don't fuck with me, boy.
All right.

Yeah, I met David at one of those parties.
- Oh.

Look, I liked him, so I introduced him around.
Turns out other people liked him, too.
You telling me he came groveling to you for money, when I had all the money in the world?
Why did he do that?
I don't know, Walter.
But he didn't ask you, he asked me.
He came to me.
Hell, I came to that boy's rescue.
Your perversity killed that boy.
I know there's nothing i can do about that now.
But there is something i can do about the threat that you created against our entire order!
Oh, god, do you have any idea what would happen here if the press got wind of this damn thing, and came down here investigating the most powerful man in the state?
Have you?
They'd be mortified by your perverted parties and your debauched behavior.
You corrupted that boy.
You may not have done it personally, but you did.
You killed him, I say.
You killed him with your own fucking hands!
You son of a bitch!
Walter.
Dr. mcgowan.
Please.
You know I have been a loyal foot soldier for over 20 years!
It's got to mean somethin'.
It ain't worth shit.
Mayo?
Could you escort this man out of the front door?
And lock it behind him.
Fuck you, Walter!
Okay, so make it easy on yourself.

Tell me who was in the car that night.
I already told you, the information is restricted!
I heard you the first time.

Travers, James Travers.
Thanks.
Yeah, detective Bob meyers, please.
Hey, yeah, Bob, it's Mike.
Yeah, I'm good, i need another favor.
Good, I'm looking for a James Travers.
Mayo... what are you doing here?
Ms. Wallace, I didn't mean to scare you none.
I just needed to say goodbye to my animals.
Goodbye?

Oh, somewhere.
It seem like trouble always got a way of catching up to me.
Mayo, good luck to you.
I'm real sorry about that boy, ma'am.
- Hey.

Yeah, look, it looks like we've finally got a break in the case.
- What?

Looks like you were right, rose.

Yeah, I'm sorry.
Oh, my god, I knew it.
Look, also Travers, right now he's our prime suspect and he's missing.
What do you mean?
We can't find him.
Well, what's next then?
Don't worry, we got a statewide lookout on him right now.
- Okay, thank you, Michael.

I'll call you as soon as I get back.
- Bye.

Rosemund, it's me.
I really don't know how to explain to you what I'm feeling right now.
But the best I can do is to tell you that you're my one true friend.
That I love you.
See, my life has been built on this one excruciating secret, and I've just never been able to exorcise it.
No matter how many times I tried to paint it out of myself.
So the way I see it, I've got one way out.
That's to go to the source of my pain and to end it.
And with David gone, I'm not afraid of that anymore.
So I finally realized that the only thing left for me to do is to go home.
To my real home, where it all started, and where it will all end.
I love you, bye.
Oh, shit.
Michael, Lucy's in trouble.
Trouble, what are you talking about?

I'm headed there now.
You do not go there without me, okay?
Sorry, I can't.

It's the old mcgowan home on beach road, okay?

No, please.

If you need anything, call me.
I knew you'd come.
I sensed you drifting up the stairs.
I always could, you know?
I come up here when I want to be close to you.
Your paintings on the wall.
You are not just my daughter... you are the love of my life.
My heart's desire.
Oh, I know, I know, the world will never condone our special relationship.
But you and I, you and I, we know that it was right.
David, poor... poor David.
A combination of your creativity and my brilliance.
David was a true genius.
Unlike his half-brother, Austin.
He's a disappointment, really.
I have no more secrets from the world.
Except one.
I love you with all my heart, Lucy.
I want to get together again, just you and me.
Please, Lucy, please.
You and I, together again.
- I was the one.

Austin, what the hell are you...?
What?

David was a dilettante.
I could have made you proud.
Austin, you've always made me proud, always.
Is that right?

All right.

Now just listen, i was planning on telling you.
Now I've been a bit of a coward about it, I admit.
But I never really found the right moment.
Yeah, there's never really a right moment, is there, dad?
When your whole life's a lie.
Listen, you are the product of a fine and great love with your mama and me.
Just like David, huh?

Alright, listen.

Special.

What the fuck are you talking about, son?
He was sick, just like you.
I was hiding in the gallery after the show was over.
David waited for Travers to show up.
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
They started to argue.

- Nice.

After Travers left, it gave me the perfect opportunity to do what I've always wanted to do.
What?
You killed him, you little shit!
Yes, his best performance.
Squirming at the end of a rope.
I should show you sometime.
Got the drive here in my pocket.

You son of a bitch!
- You little bastard!

Austin!
How long have you been drawing like this?
Since I was like five, I guess.
Well, I love art.
Where are you from?
- The coast, you?

But my parents died, so I came here.
I'm sorry.
What about you?
Um, my family thought it would be best.
Well, you'll be alright, you'll see.
- Can I see more?

Cool.
I grew up here.
That's why I keep coming back.
Hey... come on.
You okay?
I will be.
