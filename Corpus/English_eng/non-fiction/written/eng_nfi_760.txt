Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...
- We need you.

You promised me we would run off and we would be a family!
Janine, change is coming.

May the Lord keep you in His mercy.
You stupid girl.
Hopefully, he'll only receive an admonishment.
It's not going to be easy without your husband.
Why don't you worry about your own husband?
They need you to go back to Jezebel's.
They've been trying to get a package out of there.
Hide it until someone contacts you.
This is fucking ridiculous.

- Fuckin' Alma?

It could be anything!

What is wrong with you?
Do not let them grind you down.
You keep your fucking shit together.

Saved it for you.

All right.

Boy, look at these outfits.

Take your hands out of your pocket.
Did I say run, you in the vest?
Semicircle!
Equidistant.
Hands clasped.
Eyes down, girls.
There was a way we looked at each other at the Red Center.
For a long time I couldn't figure out what it was exactly.
That expression in their eyes.
In my eyes.
Because before, in real life, you didn't ever see it.
Not more than a glimpse.
It was never something that could last for days.
It could never last for years.
Step forward.
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He shall lift you up.
How do we humble ourselves?
Wonderful.
I believe an apology would be respectful as well.
Sorry.
Aunt Lydia.
I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia.
- I'm sorry, Aunt Ly...

- I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia.

Come along.
Please.
This will be painful, I am sorry to say.
But you are so very precious, we wouldn't want to lose you.
Keep still now.
That look was terror.
Utter and unutterable.
It tastes like gunmetal.
Like the point of a carpenter's nail.
Would you like a one-two-three, dear?
One...
We don't look at each other that way anymore.
It's their own fault.
They should have never given us uniforms if they didn't want us to be an army.
Praised be.
I trusted you.

You don't have anything to say for yourself?
- I don't know.

You could have left me with something.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Waterford.
Get up!

Sit down!
Sit on it.
- I don't think I can.

Now get on your knees and pray that God makes you worthy in some way.
Praised be His mercy.
He's answered our prayers.
You think I prayed for this?
You think I prayed to bring a baby into this house?
God knows what's in your heart.
Get some rest.
Ooh, she's a fighter.
- She's a fighter like Mommy.

- Oh, my gosh.

It's like a Serena Williams.
- We're gonna have a tennis player.

- She'll make us millions.

- We'll be able to retire.

Is everything all right?
Then can you please, Serena?
I have a conference call in five minutes.
They arrested three more Marthas in the West End.
They were planning some kind of attack.
Don't these people ever give up?
I forget, how many tiles do you pick to start?
Seven.
- Do you want to play?

- And, in any case, you know the law.

I helped write it.
I remember.
She's a smart girl.
I imagine that she's pretty good at this.
We'll talk about this another time.
She left makeup on the collar of my cloak.
Is that how you got her past the checkpoints?
You need to keep your hands off of her.
I will not have her hanging from a ceiling or stepping in front of a truck.
Do you understand me, Fred?
You're going to control yourself.
Control myself.
You brought lust and temptation back into this house.
On your back, and on your knees.
If I've sinned, then you led me to it.
You can blame me all you want, but He knows the truth.
Everybody answers to God.
And you answer to me.
- Go to your room.

Praised be.
Praised be.
It isn't yours.
You're weak, and God would never let you pass on that weakness.
You can't father a child because you're not worthy.
Blessed day.
Your breakfast is ready.

- Or I can make you something else.

God bless you.
Are you feeling okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

Good.

- Rita!

Sit down.
What happened?
She found out.
About the Commander.
You okay?
I'm pregnant.
What?
She had a test.
It must have been from the black market or something.
Don't.
Please.
It's terrible.
No, it's not.
Offred, get your cloak, please.
You need the car?
No.

I've made other arrangements.
We have a long drive ahead, so get comfortable.
And don't touch the curtains.
Hey, check this out.
We're here, ma'am.
Where are we, Mrs. Waterford?
Thank you.
Mrs. Waterford.

- She stays in the car.

Please!

Please, let me out!

No!

Hannah!
Hannah!
Hannah!
Let me out!
Let me out!

Let me out!

Hannah!
Hannah!
No!
No!

No!

Hannah!
Let me out.
Let me out!

Let me out!
Please!

Please, Mrs. Waterford, please!
Please, let me out.
Please!

You can drive now.
Please let me see her!

I'm begging you.

Please, please.

No!
Offred, you need to listen to me.
Please, please, take me back.

That's not going to be good for anybody.
She is a beautiful girl, Offred.
And she's happy and she's well taken care of.
And you don't have to worry about anything.
Listen to me.
As long as my baby is safe, so is yours.
No, please.
No, please.
Please, please.
Please, I'm begging you.
Please, please!
Please, Mrs. Waterford.

What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?
How can you do this?
You're deranged.
You're...

You know that?
You are a goddamn motherfucking monster!
Fucking heartless, sadistic, motherfucking evil cunt!
Fuck you, Serena!
You are gonna burn in goddamn motherfucking hell, you crazy, evil bitch!
Don't get upset.
That's not good for the baby.
No!
Furthermore, I, Warren Putnam, did knowingly engage in the sin of lust and covetousness.
And by doing so, I rent the sacred covenant that exists between myself
and my country, my brothers, and God Almighty.
I offer myself humbly to His judgment, as spoken through this council.
Body and soul shall I give to thee.
Thank you, Commander Putnam.
Go in grace.
Under His eye.
Thoughts, gentlemen?
He seems genuinely remorseful.
And he's a strong defender of the faith.
Shall we have a voice vote?
Commander, this is a serious offense.
Of course.
But who amongst us hasn't made mistakes?
And who amongst us doesn't have an afternoon of work piling up as we sit here?
Commander Waterford, we're all very busy men.
But are we too busy to stand against sin?
Of course not.
Good.
Then we should discuss next steps.
And we should remember Commander Putnam has a family, a wife and a new child.
Yes.

Yes, what we decide here will affect innocent people.
She came to ask for the harshest possible punishment.
She fears for his immortal soul.
She knows that he must make an offering to God to find redemption.
She loves her husband...
Very much.
Well, this is a nice surprise.
I've had quite a day.
How about you?
I need your help.
Of course.
I need you to...
Protect my daughter.
Please.
Protect her from what?
From her.
From Mrs. Waterford.
I'm sure you don't have anything to worry about.
Mrs. Waterford would never hurt a child.
You don't know her.
I hear congratulations are in order.
Hmm.
Hmm, yes.
Praised be.
Such wonderful news.

Hmm.
Praised be.
Is it mine?
Of course.
You do that so well.
"My name is Maria Navarro.
I was captured on December 2nd at a checkpoint outside of Hartford.
They took my son Spencer.
He was five.
He has a red birthmark on his right arm, just below the elbow.
I don't know where he is.
My name is Greer Ladestro.
I was a Handmaid at three different houses.
I was a third-year medical student at the University of Michigan.
I'm in Boston, I think.
Help me, for God's sake.

My name is Alison.
I have two daughters.

I have a sister, Julia, in London.
Whoever is getting this, please don't forget me.
Please don't forget us all.
We are prisoners.
They rape us.

You have to tell people what's happening here.
Please, God.
My eight-year-old got taken away.
My son.

Her name is Caroline.
My name is Aubrey.
My name is Gabriela."
- Sorry.

You don't get anyone for days, and then wham, 15 people all at once.
You got coffee.

You get something to eat?
Yes, thank you.

You came on mac-and-cheese night.

Thursday is turkey tetrazzini.
Hold on a second.
So, welcome to Ontario.
Wish it was under different circumstances, but we're happy to have you here.
Thank you.
Do you have any family in Canada?
We've got an alert system.
It'll text you if anyone on your list comes in.
No.
Well, great, then I get to be your best friend.
So, there's a lot to go over, but I will walk you through it.
Come, follow me.
Right this way.
Here is your refugee ID card.
I am your temp.
You will be assigned a permanent case worker in the next couple of days.
At some point...

Could you?

Cell phone.

And you have $200 for cabs on there, just to get you started.
$470 in cash.
Medical insurance card.
Prescription drug card.
Okay?
Here, some clothes.
Uh, what's next?
Um, uh, uh, uh...
Do you want more to eat?
I'm okay, I think.
Then a shower?
Or do you just want to grab a book, find somewhere quiet.
Whatever you want.
It's completely up to you.
Morning.
Good morning.
Need some help?
No, thank you.
This room gets such nice light in the morning.
What do you want, Fred?
I want to apologize.
I said some cruel things to you and I'm very sorry.
If we confess our sins...
He is faithful and just to forgive us for our sins.
Don't do that.
Listen, I know we've been through a lot...
But look where we are.
Where are we, Fred?
We're going to have a baby.
We're bringing a new life into this world.
Yes.
Yes, she is.
No.

And after that, she'll be gone...
And we'll be a family.
Three bells.
A death knell.
There's a Salvaging today.
Blessed be the fruit.
May the Lord open.
What took you so long?
Sorry.
Come on.

I said I was sorry.
God, you're gonna get me in trouble again.
You're the worst shopping partner ever.
Shut up.
You shut up.
Kneel.
Oh, man.

Good morning, girls.
Good morning, Aunt Lydia.
Well.
Look at you.
My special girls.
So beautiful.
What's going on?
Look at this day, the sky.
God's world is full of miracles, isn't it, girls?
Yes, Aunt Lydia.
Yes.
There is no greater miracle than the miracle of life.
The miracle of a child.
And there is no greater sin than harming a child.
Putting a child in danger.
Am I correct, girls?
Yes, Aunt Lydia.
Now, up.
Wings.
Come forward, please.
Quick, quick.

Don't be picky, just take one.
Watch the space between you.
There's enough for everyone.
Hi.
Ofdaniel has been convicted of endangering a child.
The punishment for that crime is death by stoning.
I know how difficult this is, girls.
I do.
But God gives us blessings and He gives us challenges.
The price of his love is sometimes high.
But it must be paid.
Now, you all know what to do.
When I blow the whistle, you are free to begin.
Not too hard, okay?
Aunt Lydia, come on.

Ofglen.

Seriously?
Guys, this is insane.
Get back in line.
Ofglen.
No.

I'm not gonna kill Janine.

No!
Are you okay?
Girls!

You are to do your duty!
Girls!
Girls!
Girls!
Offred.
Back in line.
No!
Back in line.
These girls are my responsibility.
I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia.
I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia.
- I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia.

I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia.
Go home.
Go home, all of you!
And think about what you have done!
There will be consequences.

Hey.
Hi.
How are you here?
They called me when your name came up, and you're on my list.
List?

Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
- Luke!

It's all right.
It's all right.

This could be the last time I have to wait.
But I don't know what I'm waiting for.
My punishment, I suppose.
We said no.
We refused to do our duty.
To kill Janine.
And for that sin we will be punished.
I have no doubt.
I am in disgrace.
Which is the opposite of grace.
I ought to be terrified.
But I feel serene.
And there's a kind of hope, it seems, even in futility.
I tried to make things better for Hannah.
Change the world, even just a little bit.
Just go with them.
Trust me.
Oh, God.
Behind the tub.
What is going on?
Where are you taking her?
I have a right to know where you're taking her.
Let me pass!

Fred, where are you?
I have a right to know where you're taking her, please!
Fred!
What's going on?

Everything is in order, Commander.
What did you do?
Do you have a warrant?
Everything is in order.
After everything we've done for you.
Whether this is my end or a new beginning,
I have no way of knowing.
I have given myself over into the hands of strangers.
I have no choice.
It can't be helped.
And so I step up, into the darkness within...
Or else the light.
