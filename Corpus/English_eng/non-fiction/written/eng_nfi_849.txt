Your cocktail, miss?
Mahalo, my homegirl.
Well, all right.
Now all we need is an island breeze...
- Mm.

Staycation!
You know, if you close your eyes, you can almost hear the waves lapping against the...
Hey!
Shut the hell up!

I'll get us earplugs.
At least we can still lay out in the sun.
Ugh, garbage trucks and rain!
Now we have to drink inside on the couch!
That's not a vacation, we do that everyday.
Why can't we afford to go on a real fancy vacation?
No one our age can.
We're only 24.

Ugh, Lizette.
Lizette?
Lizette.
Can you believe this Facebook post?
"So excited to marry my best friend at our destination wedding in Punta Cana!"
I want to go to Punta Cana!
Where's Punta Cana?
Dominican Republic.
She's flying down in a private jet and staying at a beachfront villa!
- She makes me sick.

We should try to get in touch with her again.
Why?
Uh, hello, we get friendly with her, she invites us to the wedding, and then we go to Punta Cana for free!
How?

"The private jet and villa are only for the wedding party."
Aw, man.
That's it.

Bridesmaids!
♪ She in the spotlight ♪
♪ And she turn my head ♪
♪ She run a red light ♪
♪ 'Cause she bad like that ♪
♪ I like that ooh baby, ooh baby ♪
♪ Baby ♪
Can you believe how great Lizette's life turned out?
Who knew she'd make so much money off of Da Bomb Lip Balm?
Ugh, yeah...
People are sheep.
Well... she's here.
- Lizette!

Lizette!
Gabi!

We have so much to catch up on.
Wait.

Yep.
Well, now I'm a multi one.
God, Lizette.

Yeah, but there is a downside.
I mean, my hand is cramping up lugging this thing around!
- Oh!

One dirty martini.
I always wondered what made it dirty.
Mm.

So...

Oh, that's my fiancé...

That's why I wanted to meet here.
He's Filipino.
I met him when he catered one of my openings.
And now, he caters all my openings.
Oh...

I know it's crazy, right?
So... you two gay marry each other yet?
'Cause that was the rumor in high school.
Uh...
Lizette, if we married each other, don't you think we would ask you to be our bridesmaid?
Nope.
Damn it.
You know what's crazy, Lizette?
That you didn't ask us to be your bridesmaids.
Why the hell would I do that?
Well, because all of our lives, you've shoved every great thing that ever happened to you in our faces.
That's not true.

I just bought a WNBA team?
Oh, mm-hmm, now I see it.
So, I mean, how great would it be to be standing in your gazillion-dollar wedding dress, under your gazillion-dollar gazebo, watching us die of jealousy because you have everything and we have gazilch?
Hmm...
That does sound fun.
You're in!
Ooh, but there is just one problem.
There's only one seat left on the jet.
Who will I chose?
Sofia, you go.
Oh, no, no, no, you go.
- I can't go without you.

And I can't believe you think you're going to decide.
It's my wedding.
I'm gonna decide whose face I shove it in.
Speaking of shoving...
Carlo!
A round of dirty martinis for my lesbian friends.
Cheers, ladies!
Yolanda, guess what?
My college invited me to give a guest lecture on my profession.
What's that?

His publicist!
The person who maintains his image, writes his press releases, and manages any crisis that pops up.
Elliot, I have a crisis!
And I shall manage it.
I got some hot sauce on my favorite hoodie.
Need you to take it to the dry cleaner, pronto.
Damn... you are critical to the team.
That's not all I do for him!
Oh, I also need you to pick me up a dozen donut holes.
And I mean a dozen, not ten with powdered sugar on your tie.
Oh, my God!
I am Josh's bitch.
How did this happen?
It's because you let him walk all over you.
I laid the law down with Josh on day one.
I can't lay down the law.
I'm not confident and manly like you.
Help me, Yolanda!
Well, if you want Josh to appreciate you, you gotta show him you have other job prospects.
Yes!
Where would I find those?
Just give me your resumé and I'll put it online for you.
Oh, yeah!
Then the offers will start rolling in, and Josh will respect me, and he'll see that I'm smart, ambitious and I'm movin' on up.
Thanks, Weezy.
I gotta say, you girls are sure being civil to one another considering only one of you can be my bridesmaid.
Well, Gabi and I talked, and we just want you to be happy.
And like you said, the bride decides.
Speaking of wedding vows!
Lizette, when I found out you were getting married,
I was just so caught up in my joy for your joy that these wedding vows just spilled out!
What?
I have been trying to write my vows for three weeks, but nothing rhymes with Filipino!
"Carlo, from the moment we met, you surprised me,"
captivated me, and challenged me like no other.
I'm black, you're Filipino,
"together we make the perfect cappuccino."
How did I miss cappuccino?
Sofia, can I talk to you in the kitchen for a minute?
There's ten more stanzas.
- What's up?

Uh, well, at the bar, you said that I should be the one to go, so I'm just trying to make sure that I'm the one who goes.
Well, at the bar, you said I should go.
I was being nice.
This is the most manipulative thing I have ever seen.
Who wants wedding cake?
- What?

Six different kinds of cake tasting, if you will.
Ooh!

Is that mousseline buttercream?
You butter believe it!
Mmm!
This cake is so much more delicious than the cake I ordered.
Gabi, will you be my...?
Mm!
Hello?
Well, I think it's clear we have a winner.
Do we Gabi?

Mm-hmm.

It's the hotel!

followed by a bunch of Spanish!
I only speak Mandarin!
Aw.

Hello?
Okay, cual es el problema?
Señor, Que necesitas para Que suceda Esta boda?
Okay, entonces van a tener Que resolver con Lil' So-so!
Entiendes?
Muchas gracias.
Okay, so, the wedding is back on.
And they're throwing in a free case of champagne!
Oh!

But, but, but, buttercream.
Sofia... will you be my bridesmaid?
- No!

Hasta la vista, loser.
Here's your coffee, and your eggs, and your toast!
Butter or jelly?
I'm just going to take this knife away.
What's going on?

Yeah, it was, until she beat me out to be a bridesmaid, and now she gets to go to Punta Cana and I'm stuck here.
Wait a minute.
Sofia won... and you lost?
That's a first.
Yeah, only because somehow she speaks Punta Can-ese.
Or I just give you the money to go to Punta Cana.
Really?
No, no, no, no.
We're having punch-card sex.
I don't want to be a kept woman.
Okay, fine, then how about I just give you some frequent flier miles?
Oh, my God.
You would give me your frequent flier miles so I could fly to Punta Cana first class?
- I never said first class.

Elliot, we got a bite on your resumé.
You're kidding me!
I knew I was good.
Guess who's looking for a new publicist?
Dante Bergeson.
The multi-billionaire who single-handedly changed the way the world drinks vodka?
I still just drink it straight from the bottle.
But that's your guy.
And he wants to have lunch with you today.
Are you kidding me?
- I could hug you.

Just go dangle Dante in front of Josh.
Whoa!
Freshly cleaned hoodie!
Hey!
I'm going to need you to go online and do traffic school for me.
Thanks.
Oh!

I have a lunch meeting this afternoon with Dante Bergeson.
The billionaire who started a space program so that Bruno Mars can perform on Mars.
Why are you meeting with him?
Well, he needs a new publicist and heard I'm feeling a tad... unchallenged.
Unchallenged?
So camping out overnight in a rainstorm, so I can get my new phone was easy?
That's it, Josh.
I'm not an errand boy, I'm a publicist, and if you can't recognize it, maybe Dante can!
- Whoa, Elliot...

Don't whoa me, Josh.
I am sick of kissing that perfect ass of yours.
Good luck replacing this, Josh.
What the hell was that?
I don't know.
Uh, but I can't do that traffic school thing for you.
My license is a little iffy.
How great was that storm-out?
And they say you don't learn anything from the Real Housewives.
Elliot, I have something tell you.
Of course you do.
Where is my lunch meeting with Dante?
On the corner of...
"I made it up," and "You went too far."
What?
There is no lunch.
You know, I was just trying to give a little confidence, light a fire under you.
I didn't know you was gonna burn down the whole damn bridge!
Oh, my God.

How could you do this to me?
You ruined my life!
Whe...

To figure out how to be Josh's bitch again!
Mm-mm!
How hot is my man?
Well, I can only see his butt.
Ain't it juicy?

- Yes.

Oh, hey!
Is this the table for all the girls going to Punta Cana?
Gabi, what are you doing here?
Oh, I just came over to say, have a good flight, have a good time, and...
I'll see you there.
You're not gonna see us there because I you lost and I won.
Oh.

Oh, my God.

No.
He gave me the ticket before I started crying.
Okay, where are you going to stay?
Well, not to worry.
Called the resort, handled the whole thing.
Turns out, they do have a room.
Sure, it's the size of a closet, sure, I may have to wear a name tag, and do a little janitorial work, but...

So I will see you bitches at the pool.
I cannot believe that you are such a sore loser that you had to weasel your way into my vacation, that I won!
Why are you so upset?

- Do I look thrilled?

If I wanted to listen to two little bitches fight over me,
I'd still be dating the Jonas Brothers.
Now, we are leaving in two hours.
I'm gonna go wax my Punta Cana and swing by in the the limo to pick you girls up.
Now, Stop!

I cannot believe you did this.
I don't understand why you're not happy.
I mean, you get to go on vacation,
I get to go on vacation.
We are both going to Punta Cana.
Oh...
Not if Carlo keeps making out with that Punta Cana.
Elliot, where have you been?
I was begging for a job.
But Alan wasn't in the mood, so I went for a walk.
Look, Elliot, I was just trying to help.
I was so mad at you, Yolanda, I didn't realize that I could actually use this whole situation to my favor.
All I have to do is make Josh think Dante wants me, then he'll cave and offer me everything I deserve.
- Elliot!

Okay, thanks again so much for doing this, Dante.
When he comes in here, just turn your chair away from us and try not to laugh.
Righty-oh.
Elliot...
Now, give it to me straight.

Well, Josh, I don't want to lie.
He did wine and dine me pretty hard.
We're talking caviar, Dom Pérignon, shrimp the size of a baby's arm.
Big ticket stuff, Josh.

Wow.

In more ways than one.
After his third drink, he got kinda handsy.
Oh!
I would have been flattered if he was hot.
But he was nasty!
The point is, even though he thinks I'm amazing, offered me more money, and said I'm one of the best publicists in town, nay, the world...

Did you?
What was that?
It kind of sounds a little like the guy you turned down.
My good friend...

Dante Bergeson!
Good to see you again, sir.
I've never met you, nor molested you in my life.
You lied to me.
I'm so sorry, Josh.

I've always said, when one man is crying on the floor, it's time to go.
Cheerio, Josh.
What's going on?
I just wanted you to respect me as a publicist.
I do your dry-cleaning, run your errands, comb your hair while you sleep...
I never asked for that last one.
All I'm looking for is a little respect.
Do you even think I'm a good publicist?
Why do you think I called your college and told them you should give that speech?
- You did that?

And look, from now on, I will hire someone else to do my personal tasks.
Thank you.
But there's still a few I can do.
Whatever you're comfortable with.
Great!
Now why don't you go take a nap and I'll get the comb?
Man, how are we gonna tell Lizette we saw her fiancé making out with another woman?
Very gently, and after the wedding.
Wait a minute.

You want to go on this vacation so bad that you totally feel justified ruining the rest of Lizette's life?
Yes, because I won.
Oh come on!

I mean if I was engaged and I was going to get married, and you saw my fiancé making out with another woman, wouldn't you tell me?
Is it a destination wedding?
Okay, that's her.

- Ugh, Gabi...

Fine!
The limo awaits, girls!
- Lizette...

Let's not keep it a-waitin'.
- Sofia!

Lizette!
Your fiancé is cheating on you!
What?
I'm really sorry, but we saw...
Carlo making out with some blonde at the bar after you left.
No, that's bull.

Oh!

I mean, what kind of marriage is this gonna be if we're both having affairs?
If you'll excuse me, I have a visa to revoke.
Oh, man.
I hated doing that, but, you know, I had to do it.
Did we, Gabi?
I can't believe you ruined our vacation.
We were this close...
Oh...

So, you didn't care if I didn't get to go because you get to go no matter what.
- What?

You didn't do it because it was the right thing to do.
You did it was because you cannot stand the fact that I beat you.
Sofia, what's going on?

This isn't you.
Kendrick got engaged.
What?
Why didn't you tell me?
He proposed to his girlfriend in the middle of the office, and they all know that I have a crush on him, and then they were all looking at me with these sad puppy dog eyes.
Yeah, like that.
Now...

Oh, no.

- Gabi...

And I just thought that if I could go on vacation that I wouldn't have to go into the office.
Oh...

You know what?
You are going on this vacation.
- How?

Oh, no, I can't do that...
Yes, you can, and you need it way more than me.
Come on.
We can't let that new bikini go to waste.
I do rock those boy short bottoms.
You're the best friend ever.
Oh, no you are.
Now, go.
Okay, bye!
She bought it!
I win!
Ha...

This time...

Seriously?
God!

Gabi!
Oh, my God.

Gabi?
Hey!
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in first class, enjoying free champagne, and the extra legroom, and ABC's new fall lineup.
- I couldn't go.

Well, because I was sitting in my taxi, on the way to the airport, when I saw that my driver's name was Anal... and I thought it was so funny, but I...
There was no one there to laugh with me.
Anal!
- That's hilarious!

And then I thought, you know,
I might've beaten you out for this vacation, but... what does winning matter, when I don't get to spend it with my best friend?
Oh...
But wait a minute.
I thought you said you needed to go 'cause you had to forget about Kendrick's engagement?
No... but I hope you will...

I made it up, I just...

Are you serious?
You lied and manipulated me to get what you want?
Respect, girl.
Wait.

Uh, yeah.

The student becomes the master.
Oh, my God.

I thought I was gonna have to get you drunk first.
I'm already two rum punches in.
Pull up a hammock.

Oh, my God.

Are we sure it's not "Anahl"?
Probably, but it's not as funny.
I'm gonna grab my purse.
Anal, I'm coming!
