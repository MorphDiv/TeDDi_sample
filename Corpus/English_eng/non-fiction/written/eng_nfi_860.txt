Hello, this is Dr. Jane Mathis.
I am calling in a prescription for Nora Green.
Yes, no "E."
DOB 2/2/1998.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, calling in for Risperdal, 125 milligrams.
Sig one tablet PO BIO.
Distribute 60-plus.

My phone number's 610-555-7682.
DEA B4758491.
NPI 13663.
Great, thank you so much.

Hello, it's Dr. Mathis and I was just calling to see how you're doing on the new medicine.
If you're sleeping okay.
If you still have anxiety.
Yes, but I need you to try harder.
You can't cancel within a 24-hour window.
Mm-hmm.
Hi, Greg.
Does 2:00 p.m. on Friday work for you?
Great.

Terry?
Terry?
Dr. Mathis?
Nora.
I did what you told me to do.
Nora...
Nora.
You need to listen to me.
Give me the glass.
Nora, it's okay.
I'm going to call the ambulance, and you're going to give me that glass.
Nora, look at me.

You were wrong.
Give me the glass.
You were so wrong.
Let me help you.
Aah!
No.
No, no, no!
Remember when you were a kid and a year felt like a really long time?
Perils of age.

So, it's the anniversary.
Two years.
I feel like I have to move on now.
I need to be helping people.
I can't...

What would you like to talk about today?
Well... feeling slightly disconnected, insecure, some mild form of general anxiety, obsessive-compulsive thoughts...
Jane, you drive 90 minutes every week to see me.
Let's make it worth the trip.
You are the patient now.
I'm sorry, I...

Last time you talked about going to see her.
I'm not ready.
Fine.
Uh... the painters left yesterday.
Finally.
Now it's kind of back to how my dad had it.
He was always working, but he... he wasn't at work when I was a kid, you know?
Could always go and visit him.
I am seeing this guy.
Oh!
He's a cop.
- I know what you're thinking.

You're thinking I...
You're thinking I'm dating Miles because I have a...
I didn't know he was a cop when I met him, okay?
I just want you to find someone you care about.
He's a really good person.
And, um, it's been a while.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...
I like him.
Well, that's good!
You see that, right?
You're confronting the trauma, and now you're getting on with it.
You just take care of yourself.
I'm taking it slow.
- Good.

That's what all great psychiatrists say.
Finally, you know, I just got up,
I walked into her office, and I told her... you know, I told her that she was wrong.
You know?

Feel good?
Actually, yes!
It's like this giant weight's been lifted off my shoulders.
Good.

Mm.
Greg?
Um... you think there's anything you might be able to give me?
You know, I'm still having a lot of anxiety.
Let's try a few more sessions working through it first.
All right?
Dr. Mathis.
Hello?
Hi.
Can I help you?
I...
I thought...
I don't...
I-I don't know how to start this.
Are you looking for a psychiatrist?
Ah, um...

Well, I should tell you, Mr...
Alex.
Alex, I don't do post-trauma anymore.
I haven't for quite some time.
But I can recommend some very qualified...
Please, I don't...

I need to start over fresh.
I need to put this behind me, and if you're the best, then I...

Ebenezer Scrooge.
Oh, no!

Much.
You don't believe in me.
Oh.
Hello.
You must be Alex.
Come in.
Sit anywhere you'd like.
Most people choose the couch.
Clich√©, I know.
What can I say?

Uh, it is Alex, right?

Um, yeah, that's fine.
Can you... pull the curtains?
Oh, sure.
Better?
I like your lack of Christmas spirit.
Well, holidays are stressful.
I like to make this place a safe zone for those who are about to drown their relatives in eggnog.
So... what's the first step?
You tell me.
Why are we sitting here?
Besides the obvious?
Do you want to talk about that?
See, this is why I never do this.
What do you mean?
It annoys me that you people never guide the sessions, sort of leave us here, like struggling fish in a boat.
Also, my... my last therapist couldn't stop staring.
Well, Alex, that's what therapy is.
We listen... and then we analyze and treat.
I want someone to tell me how to live with this.
Well, I'm not a life coach.
You open up, and we talk.
Therapy's a give and take.
You get out of it what you put in.
But shouldn't you ask more questions?
Family history?
Why I dream of being buried alive by my grandfather?
Does that happen?
It was a joke.
Well, we can start off by talking about your childhood.
No.
I want to talk about this.
I don't see myself.
Disassociation.
That's... that's common with people who've undergone such a extreme procedure.
Women, and... well, people who've even had a simple nose job are bothered by their own reflection.
This isn't some housewife desperately trying to hold on to her youth.
I need medication.
I want to take something so that I can forget about this transplant.
It's been my experience... that drugs usually make things worse.
I'm not like other psychiatrists.
I won't put you on something I don't think is necessary.
I care about the patient first.
And the other shrinks don't?
- Don't?

And the other doctors, what do they care about?
Well, everyone has their own approach.
But I believe that talking and exposing what's bothering you is the healthiest, and coupled with things like meditation, leading a balanced life, and... if I find that there's no other option, medication.
No drug company kickbacks?
Look, I'm sorry.
I get defensive when I have to talk about me.
It's just so...
- Weird?

Fucking weird.
- Mm-hmm.

Well, why don't we do this?
Why don't we just start over, and we'll go at your speed.
##
Hurry up!
You coming or what?
You want some of this?
Oh, yeah, thanks.
Whew.

Mnh-mnh!
- Sprinter versus long distance.

No, I-I thought I saw something.
It was probably a deer.
Have I told you how glad I am that you're back?
You must've been so bored without me.
No, I just...

Well, it won't be that exciting.
Well, can we at least go out a few times?
I mean, bring, um...
Miles?
- Miles.

Miles.
Yeah, well...
Jane.
Clara, don't.
I'm proud of you.
Okay, thank you.
I really am.
You ready?
No.
Best job in the world.
# There's no place like home... #
This place is nice.
Yeah.

Not hungry?
I'm sorry.
This time of year makes me think about...
Work?
Yup.

Used to infuriate my ex.
How'd you stop?
Years and years of therapy.
Oh, ho, I see.
Should I contact your doctor for your records?
Might not be a bad idea.
Let you know what you're in for.
Mm.
Ahem.
How was your day?
I was at the grocery store, and this little girl was staring at me.
And how did that make you feel?
I mean, she was just a little kid, but... she didn't look away... and it really got to me.
I mean, I was supposed to be this new person now, not a... not a freak.
Well, it's... better than the alternative, right?
You know, before the operation, I didn't leave my house for a year.
You don't have to now.
Deliveries and online shopping.

Lonely, but easy.
I was miserable before I got on the donor list, but now, after this change...
I don't know who I am anymore, and that's...
It's worse.
At least before when I looked in the mirror, I knew who I was, and now... it sounds like bad lyrics, but there's a stranger looking back.
We're going to begin what's called exposure therapy.
We need to go back to the night of the accident.
I don't...

We'll just start from the beginning.
Very slowly.
I'm not sure how I got there.
What do you remember?
I really don't remember.
Alex, breathe.
Breathe deeply.
Very good.
I want you to place yourself there.
Oh... hmm.
Uh, it was a Thursday.
I was coming home from work, so I...
I must have been driving.
What was the road like?
Was it bumpy or smooth?
It was smooth... like they had just repaved it.
There was glass... and a... and a bumper.
I-I had to slow down.
It's hard to describe.

The pieces are there, but it's...

Back together.
Hello?
- Alex?

I can't do this.

I thought my life would change, but it...
God, it's... it's gotten worse.
I'm going to get you a glass of water.
At least before, I was me.
Look at me.

Take a deep breath in.

Alex.

Alex.

Now, nice and easy.
You had a panic attack.
Here.
Let's...

Um, it's an exercise.
It's called 478.
So, exhale completely.
Close your mouth.
Now breathe in for four through your nose.
Hold it for seven, and then exhale through your nose for eight.
I know, I know, it takes a little getting used to, but that'll help the next time this... this happens, okay?
I'm so sorry about this.
No, no, no, no.
You're not the first.
It's a lot of trauma to process.
Same time next week?
Uh, you sure you're okay?
I'm fine.

# In the bleak midwinter #
# Frosty winds made moan #
# Earth stood hard as iron #
#Water like a stone #
# Snow had fallen, snow on snow #
# Snow on... #
And then you woke up?
Sort of.
I felt heavy.
Like I couldn't move.
It's been a while since you've had sleep paralysis.
I can prescribe something.
No, no.

I'm fine.
Well, what do you think is triggering this?
Possible cyclothymia?

What's going on here?

- It's been a rough couple weeks.

- You're not being...

You have stopped progressing.
I don't think that's true.
We spend most of the time talking about renovating your house.
I had to drag this dream out of you.
And even now, you don't want to go much further.
Now, if you weren't you... and you were just some other patient, I would say that you lack insight, but I know there's more you're keeping from me.
I've taken on a post-trauma patient.
He was horribly disfigured a few years ago, and it's made him...
We talked about this.
He needs my help.
You promised to take less extreme cases.
It's the only thing I'm good at.
Well, that's absurd.
He's not dangerous, he's just hurt.
I'm already helping him.
Well, what is it doing to you?
Jane?
I hear something strange.
What's going on?
Oh, can you...?
Jane?
Why did it happen?
- Aah!

- Why did it happen?

Why did it happen?
What is it?

- It's a patient.

Why did it happen?
Alex.

Why did it happen?
Wake up.

So, what do you want to do?
I'm not gonna press charges.
But I'm gonna stop seeing him as a patient.
Is this what happened last time?
No.
He's on sleeping pills.
Look, I-I appreciate you looking after me.
I can take care of myself.
I promise.
Okay.
What's wrong with his face?
Oh, it's...
Can you stay tonight?
Of course.

Of course I can.
Okay.

Okay.
I'm right over here.
We're going to have to discontinue our sessions.
I can recommend someone.
It was a mistake.

I need this.

- Alex.

This will never happen again.

You don't understand.

I'm...

I will do anything...

- Just...

Please.
I can send you a list of recommendations.
You must be Nora.
Come on in.
How, um...
How do I start?
You don't need to be nervous.
This will be easy.
It doesn't seem easy.
If at any point you're uncomfortable, you can always stop.
You're in control.
Do you see a lot of kids my age?
I specialize in adult and adolescent psychiatry.
Is this confidential?
The only person I'll talk to is you.
No one will know I'm here?
No one.
And I do... need help.
Hey, what's... what's going on?
Oh, it's just...

- Oh!

Yeah.
So, what do you think?
Mm?
Um, maybe you should...
I don't think there's any possibility of me getting ahead in that place.
I don't know, I just don't see it.
##
# I see the #
# Snowflakes fall... #
Jane?
Oh, yeah!
- Here you go.

- More lights.

I really don't know what got on that.

- Oh, that's not pretty.

- Oh.

Yeah.
I'll take that.
Hey, listen.
We've been seeing each other a while now, right?
Yes.
I think we're at the point... where if something... if you want to talk about something...
I'm not gonna run away.
I like you, Jane.
A lot.
Oof.
Oh, Jane...

I took too many pills.
Can you help me?
I don't have anybody else.
- Something important?

It's a patient of mine.
I'm sorry, I gotta go.
Everything all right?
Yeah.

Alex!
Alex?
Alex, open the door.
Open the door.
You... you didn't call an ambulance.
No.
But if you don't let me in, I will.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to call you.
It's okay.
What did you take?
If you don't tell me, I'm going to have to call 911.
I'm scared.
I don't want to live like this, but I can't...
I don't want to...
I keep thinking about...
I keep thinking about her.
Alex.
Oh.
I'm sorry, Jane.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
How many of these did you take?
I just wanted to sleep for a while.
What did you give me?
It's called Naloxone.
I only use it for emergencies.
And you didn't call an ambulance, did you?
- 'Cause I can't afford...

Please don't give up on me.
The breathing exercises have been working.
The insomnia is still bad, but it's better than...
You put up some Christmas decorations.
When I came in, I saw the tree.
You were saying something.
Stay with that.
Better than...?
You know what I was about to say.
But you need to say it.
It's better than trying to kill myself.
Good.
Very good.
For the first time in a long time,
I-I really want to get better.
Well, then, we need to finish talking about the night of the accident.
We need to learn how to exist with it.
I... do you think I can handle it?
Yes, you can.
Come on.
- Oh...

Start breathing evenly.
In and out.
Feel the weight of your limbs pulling you down.
Feel the ground underneath your feet.
Breathe deeply, evenly.
Yes, that's good.
Just relax.
Now, take me back.
I'll try.
You're on a road.
I'm on the road.
There's a hand.
Help, please.
I need to help him, but...
I'm really scared.
My-my face feels hot.
I can help them.
I can help them.

Get back.
And...
Hello?

I'm gonna need your help, okay?
And then...
Oh...
And then...
I don't know.

Oh, I can't.

That's okay.

No.

This is... this is a nightmare for me.

You know because you were told.
Right?
I think you saved them.
And I wish I'd never stopped.
There's nothing you can do about that.
We're not here to regret the past.
I think we're onto something, Alex.
Do you know what PTSD is?
Of course, it's all you hear about on the news with the cops and soldiers.
Right, there's that, but it can be used to describe all kinds of traumas.
Assaults, loss of a loved one, major surgeries...
So, if we can expose the trauma, we can move past it.
I don't...

It's-it's too much.
I can't.

Just try.
Try.
In your apartment, you mentioned "her."
Was that the woman in the accident?
Oh, I can't sleep because I keep being dragged back to that place.
Do you have any idea what that's like?
I do.
I do.
Um, I've, uh...
You've what?
- I've...

I have to go.
Hello.
Hi.

I just wanted to apologize.
That-that wasn't me.
I-I appreciate what you're trying to do.
You can't just storm out whenever anything gets painful.
That's not gonna help you get better.
I know, you're right.

You're right.
You're only trying to help me, and I'm...
I'm waking up in your house and running out of...
Can I still see you next week?
Same time.
Have a good weekend.
Aah!
You don't have to be nervous.
This'll be easy.
Nora?
Nora, I want to help, but this needs to stop.
Nora?
Nora.
# Ding dong, ding dong #
# Ding dong, ding dong #
# E'en so here below, below... #
Dr. Mathis?
Dr. Mathis?
We needed the room.
You should've notified me.
Well, you know how this works.
Her next of kin died a year ago.
He was the one footing the bills.

I kept her here as long as I could, but I had to let go of most of my staff, and Nora showed progress.
She was my patient.
I should've been notified of her release.
When she left the facility, she was calm, she was stable.
You mean doped up?
Look, whatever happened between you two, the medication had nothing to do with it.
Where were you keeping her?
Right this way.
This is our quiet room for our more aggressive patients, people who might hurt others.
It actually has one of our best views.
How long was she here for?
Twenty-three months.
What are you looking for?

Like I said, it's the best view in the building.
You could've pressed charges, you know.
Might've made things better.
Did you tape your sessions here?
You went to your psychiatrist's office and assaulted her.
Do you remember doing that?
It wasn't like that.

I just wanted to show her what she did.
It's painful, I know, but...
How could you know?
Unless you've been through it.
She told me to confront...
You mean Dr. Mathis.

Yes.
That's curious, because her notes on your sessions said that you both agreed that it was a good idea.
No, I...
I-I didn't know...
Nora, we need to get better before you can go home.
I'm not the one that's sick.
Nora.
I saw him for the first time, and when I went to him, he smiled and put his hand on me.
Nora, listen to me.
- Please stop scratching.

Nora.

- In place so I couldn't fight back.

- He took me to a clearing...

Room 111!

Nora!

Nora, stop!
That was the last thing she said about that night.
She never brought it up again.
That night she broke into my office.

Well, that's part of the job.
She wanted to forget... and I wouldn't let her.
They let her go.
Who was paying for it?
Her dad.
But I just found out that he died.
I didn't even know they were in contact with each other.
She told me they hadn't spoken since she was a kid.
We got her description now.

Okay, thanks.
If she comes back, don't try to engage.
Oh, I gotta go.

Okay.

- Hi, Alex.

I'm so sorry about that, and...
I'm also sorry about the noise.
Um, look if you want to reschedule, that's fine with me.
No, it's...

Is, um, is this... is this about me?
About what I did?
Please.
This isn't about you.
There were a few disturbances, and it's better to be safe than sorry.
Well, if there's anything I can do, let me know.
The other patients I have...
I'm not saying that they don't need my help, it's just that my area of expertise is...
I-I understand.
It's hard to be something that you're not.
Has your process ever not worked?
I'm sorry, I...
I treated a patient a while ago.
She suffered abuse for her whole young life.
But she couldn't see who it was.
To her, as a child, he was a monster... coming into her room... constantly taking from her.
At some point, we managed to piece together some memories.
Who was it?
Never got that far.
What was stopping...?
I made a mistake.
I relied too heavily on medication, and I didn't listen to what she needed.
I failed her.
And I'm not going to do that again.
Let's go back to the night of the accident.
Hello?
Hello?

I'm gonna need your help, okay?
Come with me.
I pulled her onto the grass.
Staring up at the sky...
I felt numb.
Warm.
There was shouting, but I...
I couldn't hear them.
I couldn't move.
It didn't bother me.
You were in shock.
You might not believe this, but I...
I wasn't scared.
Not really.
Until I remembered...
I-I kept asking them what happened.
I don't...

To my... to my... to my daughter.
I'm sorry, I-I didn't...
I didn't know.
I don't know how long I laid there... staring at her body.
I couldn't...

It was impossible to talk about.
If I hadn't stopped to help those people, she'd be alive.
I can remember it all now.
So clearly.
This is the first time we've confronted your loss.
This is a huge breakthrough.
Do you see?
Do you see that?
Now, instead of being haunted by it... you can learn to live with it.
I can't...

Alex.

Remember what I told you.
Come on, 478.
Breathe.
You did good.
Good.
Conduct me where you will.
I went forth last night on compulsion... and I learned a lesson, which is working now.
Tonight, if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.
Look.
Nora?
Thanks, Charlie.
The sooner the better on this, okay?
It's going tonight.
Hey.
Yeah, see, someone's been messing with your system.
That jump in the timecode there, that's where you saw the footprints.
And then it picks up a few hours later.

I was the only one who had access to it.

Why didn't you tell me about this the first time it happened?
I could've helped you.
If I call the cops, she goes back to the ward, drugged and forgotten.
She hurt you.
If I had listened, really listened...
Hey, you can't think about it like that, okay?
Some people, they're just not wired right.
That's it.
I am terrified, and I haven't been sleeping.
I don't blame you.
I had to cancel my patients, Terry, and that really hurts because of that... the trauma patient.
He really needs my help.
And I just keep seeing Nora, and I feel like I'm losing my mind.
Jane, you have to accept the fact that you cannot help this woman anymore... and you should come and stay with Liz and me.
Hmm?
That's really nice.
I will be staying with Clara, though, until this is all over.
- But thank you.

Can I have a glass of water?
Yes, you certainly can.
Hi.
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
We don't have a session today.
I cancelled all my patients.
I know.

I was just in the neighborhood, and I thought...
You can't just drop by like this.
Is everything okay?
I can recommend a doctor if you need to speak...
No, that's all good.

I didn't realize...

It's been so long since I've talked to someone, I...
After our last session, I thought maybe we were closer than that.
I am your doctor.
It's easier for me to do my job if we maintain some sort of distance and boundaries.
You...

Here.

He's a good friend and a very good doctor.
I'm sorry.
You were wrong.
No!
You were wrong.
You did this to me.
Wrong, wrong, wrong!
Wrong!
Let me in!
Let me in!
Let me in!
Let me in!
Get out...
What did you do?
What did you do?
Why are you doing this to me?

Leave me alone!
Water.
Ah, what's that?
Why are...?
Where am I?
What am I doing here?
What's that?
What is that?
Hey.
Terry.
Don't be afraid.

Sure.
Why...

We're going to get you the right care, I promise you.
Care?
Mathis, Jane.
Intake session number one.
Intake...
This is a mistake.
Terry.
Do you know why you're here?
Nora Green attacked me in my house... and I had to defend myself.
I don't remember much more, just I f...
I think I was drugged.
Can you just... can you please get me out of this thing?
It's not that easy, Jane.
You're going to remain here on a psychiatric hold until your trial.
This was obvious self-defense.
Where's Miles?
He can explain everything.
Or Clara.

We got your blood tests back.
I'm sorry, Terry, I didn't tell you.

Can you please tell me what's going on?
How long have you been taking scrips from me?
Terry, I never meant to hurt you in any way.

What would you say to Miles if he were here?
What would I...?
I would ask him for his help.
He knows what's been happening between me and Nora.
What?
She doesn't need to see that.
She's my patient now, and, yes...
Yes, she does.
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on?

What did you take?

Come here, come here!

- Look at me!

Hey!

Come on, come on!
Look at me.

We think he came over to find you because you weren't picking up your phone.
Probably to tell you they found Nora.
No.

She hung herself.
A couple of days later, a neighbor came by, complained about the smell.
You were in a drug-induced hysteria,
- and we're going to figure this out.

I didn't do this.
I-I did...

You did see this.
Could I talk to you just for a minute, please?
Just for a minute.
I don't want to make trouble here, but I can.
We're going to put you on a regimen.
I'll consult with Dr. Drummond.
You help us help you.
There's some police outside.
They want to ask you some questions.
End session.
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought we were close.

I would've helped you, you know?
I was so excited when you moved home.
So excited.
I'm just sorry you did this all yourself.
I know you didn't want to do this, right?
I...

You... you were scared.
We're gonna get you out of here.
At the trial, I'm gonna be your character witness.
But I told them, I don't have character.

It's Christmas in a few days, so I'll...
I'll try to come visit.
I'm so sorry.
- No, you were wrong.

I didn't!
No.

Where...

Where...?
You have nothing to say?
I want to be let out.
I don't belong here.
You killed a police officer.

Someone did this to me.
All of this.
Nora, you mean, or Nora's ghost?
This isn't what we're here for, but I'm gonna humor you.
Nora Green, who was dead by the time you turned homicidal, broke into your house, injected you with a drug cocktail, left, hung herself, and decayed.
Do you belittle all your patients?
No, no, no, I'm just trying to make you understand so that we can start your therapy.
Isn't that what you do, the, uh, confrontation technique?
I help people by...
By breaking their sanity.
You help no one.
Nora's reality was so distorted by the time she got here, she couldn't tell the difference between what was real and what wasn't.
She was convinced her father was dead, and the entire time I'm sitting there, looking at this girl, feeling so bad that she's being manipulated by... an unstable physician.
Say that part again.
You don't help anyone.
No.

She had talked about how she killed her father, even though I spoke to him.
He was paying the bills in this facility the entire time.
What did she say she did to him?
That's not important.
His face?
How would you know that?
Don't do it!
Don't do it.
Unlock me.
Take a breath.
Right now.
Open your eyes.
It's time for some confrontation therapy.
Surprise.
I've been trying to find a way... to sneak you out of that place.
Sitting in that parking lot every day, and...
You come running out!
It was a Christmas miracle!
Why are you doing this?
You forced your way into our lives.
Poisoned her.
She was perfect.
Tell me...
I want to understand.
You couldn't possibly understand.
You don't allow yourself to feel.
I've been watching you.
The pills.

Keeping everyone at arm's length.
I don't.
I love Miles.
Of course you did.
He knew exactly what was going on.
That's why he's alive.
Or your... your... your best friend.
She just wanted you to open up.
Mmm.
And Terry?
A guy you pay to sit in a room and reveal nothing.
You had no problem talking to me about Nora.
We were happy.
Happier than you've ever been.
You're right.

Yeah.
When my parents died, I was young.
I was alone, and I ran from this house.
Trying to be what they would have wanted.
But you failed.
Just like you failed to keep your hands off your own flesh and blood!
Can't help who you love, Jane.
Stay put.
Enjoy the view.
All this to punish me?
You needed a lesson in accountability.
Dr. Mathis?
I stopped paying her insurance payments.
Filed my own death certificate.
Changed my name.

Lonely.
But easy.
Tell me something.
What did you see... the night you slashed up your boyfriend?
I saw Nora.
That's perfect.
I saw what you made of her.
I loved her.
More than any father could.
God.
There was no car accident, was there?
There was, actually.
Funny story.
I couldn't tell the hospital the truth.
They would ask too many questions.
Fucking bitch!
They wouldn't understand.
That's why they put you on the donor list.
Ding!
Now, tell me... all the time we had together, there must have been... something real.
Some part of you that wanted to confide in me.
Ah.
That little girl in the grocery store.
That wasn't the first time you felt like a freak.
It's not about your face.
You've been this way for a long time.
Who hurt you, Alex?
Who hurt you so badly that you couldn't stop yourself from hurting Nora, too?
I can help you.
I can make you feel normal again.
Let me help you.
What happened to you?
Ohh!
Terry was first.
He died of a heart attack midway through.
But I learned a lot from Clara.
And you're next.
What are you doing in there?
Taking more pills?
Taking more medication...
To help you forget?
Oh, God.

Ohh.
Damn.
