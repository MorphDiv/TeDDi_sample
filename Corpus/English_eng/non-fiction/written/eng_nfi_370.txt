Hey, we found the cat.

Probably wanting' to smell him or somethin'.
Why do you hate me so much?
- We don't hate you, Mom.

Get out.
Mom, we're... we're sorry.

You're not welcome here in my home anymore.
Can we at least help you clean things up for you?
No!
What a bunch of crazy drama that was.
She is really upset.
Eh, she'll be fine.
You wanna go to Hooters and get some soup?
Hooters?

Oh, it's Trish.
I leave work for a few days and everything goes to hell.
It's gonna have to be a rain check on the Hooters soup.
Oh.

Maybe you'd consider that.

I need a job.
You're rambling on like a crazy person.
- Nice to see you.

- How are you?

Uh...

Okay, so what kind of clown jobs are you looking for?
Uh, at this point, anything, I mean,
I'll do theaters, you know, galas, store openings, fiestas.

Oh, hey, my birthday's coming up in ten months.
I could hire you for that.
Okay, yeah, good.

Well, right now it's in the early planning stages,

How old are you gonna be?
- Forty-nine.

How old are you gonna be?
I'm gonna...

I wasn't born in '49.
Okay, yes, a birthday.

That would be great.

Oh, have you read these stories about these clowns coming to towns and, like, spooking children?
Yeah, like when there have been...
People have been filling out police reports and stuff.
Yeah, can you see if that's a payed gig?
- Um, yeah.

Maybe just go out in the woods?
Like, go look for clowns doing it in the woods, and ask them if they get paid?
Yeah, but don't get in the way of their work.
Just ask them, you know, is this a payed gig?
If it doesn't pay, but it could get you really great exposure, would you be interested?
Now you're thinkin', Martha.

That sounds good.

Don't go during the day.

You know what, Chip?

Yeah, I don't know how much of it is enthusiasm, Martha, versus just... desperation.
I think I'd just like to function as a normal person for once.
Um, do you want to talk about what happened in jail, or where you were?
Well, I got mixed up with some squatter types, and, uh, their leader was a drug addled flautist.
And, uh, I witnessed his body get snapped in half on a choo choo train.
Okay.
Um...
I'm gonna look into some of the parties and...
Yeah.
- The openings and stuff.

This is off to a good start, Martha.
Oh.
- Baptisms.

Yeah, but no religious ones.
[Fan blowing]
How much longer will this take?
Uh, hard to say.
Uh, the water damage went pretty deep.
We need to tear the floor open, check for joist rot.
That smell you're smelling is a combination of mold and sewage, so we need to see what we can bleach, and what we need to toss.
If I were you, I'd rip up the sub floors...
