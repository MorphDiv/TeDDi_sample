Previously on Wynonna Earp...
- What happened?

Please!

I can't end the curse unless I send every single revenant back to hell.
- Dolls?

- He's a good man.

When we're out of range, tell control to go in hot.

Careful now.

- There are things out there too.

- You ready?

Run!
Doc, quick!
Shit!
You made it awful peevish!
It was plenty peevish and headed for your back when I shot it!
Waverly!
My hat!

Yeah, 'cause that's the takeaway here.

We haven't formally met.
I'm Wynonna.
Wynonna Earp.
You said you were ready for anything.
Juan Carlo was right.
More than just revenants flooding the Ghost River Triangle now.
- Wait, what's a Juan Carlo?

- Dead.

Simple.
We use it to rescue Dolls.
Yes, sir, but a fullscale assault at this juncture will not be prudent and will only draw more attention to the situation in Purgatory, not to mention the slaughter of thousands.

Thank you, sir.

Your missile strike has been called off.
And my demon?
Dispatched.
Wynonna goddamn Earp.
Yeah, Earp has always been hard to contain.
Speaking of containment, your transfer to Black Rock prison is set for 0600 hours.
Get him out of here.
You're saying Wynonna Earp was Robert Bobo Swain's jilted lover
- and he poisoned the entire town?

See, Wynonna's not a flowers and chocolate kind of a girl.
D'you anticipate charging Earp as an accessory after the fact?
We're weighing the evidence, considering our options.
Thanks, Pam.
So no parade down main street in my honour then?
I'd settle for a smoothie and one sad stripper.
Look, the town needed a plausible, nonsupernatural explanation for what happened.
- And they already hate you, so.

Earp, you may be the hero that Purgatory deserves...

- right now.

Hell no.

- You truly are a monster.

I'm a monster who knows what you sacrificed to save this town.
- Don't get all emotional on me...

It's that smell.
Yeah, they found a dead possum in the vents.
They who?
Hang on.

Right.
Black Badge showed up with the antidote, then they stayed to clean everything out.
They've got all of Dolls' shit?
Well, I kept his mug.
Deputy Marshall Dolls was too smart and too stubborn to keep anything truly important here anyway.
Where did he sleep?
Good question.
I don't know, Waves.

Bingo.

I'll grab what I can, meet you back at the Homestead.
Wow.
Neat freak in the streets, chaos in the sheets.

What the portable travel lab... crossdressing hell?
Real slow.

Also I am the cops.
I mean, kind of.

Son of a Charlie horse!
Joke's on you, bitch.
Gun only works for me.
- And I grew up with two sisters...

What the hell are you doing in
- my hotel room?

Like, you and Dolls'...?
- You know X?

Yeah, he's my...
I'm his...

- What?

Weird.
He never mentioned you.

You have amazing taste in underwear.
My poor, brave baby.
We sure do a lot of patching each other up these days.
Yeah, when there are so many other things that we should be doing.
Sorry.

- Hey, Waves...

You taste... different.
Ahem!

I am now in the kitchen...
When did you become such a prude?
Didn't you own a brothel?
It was a bordello, and it is called being a gentleman.
Well, I appreciate it, Henry.
I'm gonna go.

- I'll see you later.

- She's a lovely girl.

What about the rest of it?

You know, I don't think Wynonna's even sat down since...
I'm worried about her.
As am I.
But I was asking more particularly about yourself, Waverly.
Willa was your sister too.
I feel fine.
Yeah.

- I feel strong.

That's good.

Wynonna can handle herself.
Hurts like a mother.
Woman, it's just a bruise.
I know.
So how long have you been... staying here with Dolls?

- Few weeks.

You can't be Black Badge.

And your holds are atrocious.
I'll have you know I'm kind of a big deal around here.
I'm the Earp heir.
Destined to fight Wyatt's revenant demons.
End a curse?
I took you out with a lamp.
Yes, and it was awesome.

Black Badge.
Said they're taking him to prison.
Shit.

Because he defied their orders.

Xavier told me that if he was ever gone or didn't check in for 24 hours I should burn his files.
- Did you?

Besides, disgraced Black Badge agents don't go to prison.

Dark ops, middle of the Baltic Sea, average life expectancy once you get there is like two months.
I'm not giving up on him.
Then you're gonna need me.
They won't transfer him right away.
Any safe house they store him in...
- I have clearance to get us inside.

Look, Eliza,
- if you care about Dolls...

Well, that makes two of us.
- I'm in.

But you should prepare yourself.
Not only is there a high chance of us getting dead, but Dolls might already be.
Or worse.
What's worse than dead?
All the files from Dolls' motel room and nothing on where they might have taken him.
The location of Black Badge satellite offices are kept secret, even from one another.
Makes it way harder to track their movements, activities.
- Paranoid much?

If you only knew the stuff they were into...
I do not believe we have met.
Yeah, OK, this is Eliza, she is a friend of Dolls'.
Dolls has a friend?
- A "friend".

Yeah, OK, so this is my sister Waverly and her...
- Girlfriend.

- And that's...

- As in Doc Holliday?

OK, so how do we spring Dolls?
Well, Eliza, Doc and I need to find the latest coordinates from the local BBD safe house.
I can use my credentials, but here's the thing:
There are no guns allowed on site.

It's just plastic cattle prods and baseball bats.
Old school.
Means we got a fighting chance.
- They'll have metal detectors.

- Aw, you did math!

I'm saying this, but without Bobo keeping them in line, who knows what they're up to.
- Yeah, Bobo...

- with Officer Haught.

- Yeah?

Dolls deputized me before he...

- Indeed.

Hey, can I... can I talk to you?

OK, when was the last time you slept slash ate slash applied deodorant?
Did Bobo do something to you?
Don't deflect, I hate it when you do that.
Wynonna, listen, 24 hours ago you shot our sister.
Yeah, and it sucked.
- She sucked.

Not helping.
I'm sorry.
Listen, I need you to be OK.
So why am I dragging you into this again?
Because I love you?
Because you couldn't stop me if you tried?

Alright, we'll grieve when we save him.

OK?

Hit me.
This'd be a lot easier if I had a combo.
80, 62, 88.

Shit.

But I am.
- Guys?

30 hours, give or take.

Guys.
You figure Black Badge will provide medication on their end?
Not a chance.
- What do they care if Dolls devolves now?

What are you talking about?
Deputy Marshall Dolls is many things.

He's a good man.
He's also not a man at all.
- Hey now.

- Earp, c'mon.

Old Bread Factory on Cherry Brick Road!
- Thanks.

Hope you're up for some dumpster diving.

- Need what?

Credentials?
What exactly are you transporting here?
The last of the shit from Purgatory.
Please exit the vehicle.
We've had a rough day, ma'am.
You know the drill.
Christ, you smell like shit
- rolled in shit.

If only, friend.

- Long dead.

We don't get to cleanup, that smell's likely to linger round here for weeks.
- We good to go?

My.
There's lots more where that came from, Tex.
I'm from Georgia, ma'am.
Your head looks naked.
Why are you sneaking around if you have a security pass?
I had to get up there to cut the wire that disables the alarm.
- No turning back now.

Better nut up and decide who you can trust.
Dolls provided you guys with guns I've never even heard of.
- What is this, Russian?

We're not taking any guns.
OK.
Hey, you gonna be OK with this?
You and I working side by side for Black Badge?
Having to stare at your gorgeous smile and pretty French braid around the conference table...
Actually, I'm thinking of cutting it.
Think I'll manage.
I don't know what we're gonna find at that trailer park.

And desperate things make desperate decisions.
- We're not going to the trailer park.

This, Nicole, is for the greater good.
What?
OK, if you want me to trust you, you've gotta tell me the plan.
Preferably before I find you holding an axe over my head.
Wynonna made me promise not to.
She's my sister, Nicole.
I have to protect her now more than ever.
Hey... just like I need to protect you.
Yeah.

I just...
I just wanna make sure you're OK, you know, that... that deep down, you're still... my Waverly.
Totally.

- This is the door to the cells.

You backstabbing charlatan.
- Son of a...

Yeah.

No, I didn't, I swear!

- I'll call in Plan B.

Walking through the front door, right about... now.
Liz Wallis Windsor, Scotland Yard.

One ore daemonium?
Jolly big mouth demon?
Of course.
The shoes, don't forget the shoes.
Thing is, there's no visit from Scotland Yard scheduled in the log.
Listen...

It'd be one remarkably elaborate con, right, chap?
Silver bullets.

Brilliant.

Left, right, right again.
Marvelous.

- Toodles, really?

Waverly, that is the worst British accent I've ever heard.
- I improvised, OK?

Keep that getaway car running,
Agent Haught.
You don't gotta stay there and watch me.
- I'm not going anywhere.

In a couple hours you're going to Black Rock.
And I'd like to be the last person you see before they blindfold you.
Well, well, Agent Shapiro.
Eliza?
- I told her not to come here.

You did try to pull her out of that fire fight
- near Kabul.

I couldn't save them both.
- You left my husband to die.

Greg told me to leave him.
He knew he was bleeding out.
He liked you.
You've always been a popular guy.

Wynonna?
Doc?
You know, they're...

You stay put, OK?
Lucado!
Lucado!
Hellooo?
Hello?

Whoa.
You guys already have one.
A big one.
Plan B here, good for eliminating all unwanted problems quickly.
- OK, that was inappropriate...

- Yes, I have delivered the package.

And yes, I'm on my way to the getaway car, far, far away from the danger.
No, no, not that, nyet.
Plan B, AKA you, needs to become Plan C.
Tell me what you need.
They're not gonna keep us in here forever.

- He saved my life, you know.

You shared a hotel room, you were obviously very close.
C'mon, Earp.

What?
I just like to see you squirm.
Look, we came all this way for him.

He's what Black Badge made him.
Though they lied to him about that, too.
That's why I was in Purgatory.

What they did to us.
There is a possibility I am now hallucinating.
- Jesus.

I'm prepared for that.
And I'll take care of it.
Though I was kind of hoping
I could go 24 hours without killing someone I...
Pray tell, what exactly is Waverly doing?
So, in London, we have a R500...
Do you mean the S550?
Right, yes.

- Bollocks.

Yeah, I agree.

He's an American rapper.
I'm British, not elderly.
No, listen, our system gives us trouble when it comes to opening security doors...?
You mean like... this?
Can you open all of them simultaneously?
Within the entire facility?

OptionJ3.

Not that you'd ever want to...
What the hell?
- We can't bleed in here!

Because it'll smell it.
That is a Hala,
- a Bulgarian devourer of souls.

Real mad.

- Where?

No, no, no!
Why did you hit me?
OK, my name is Waverly, Waverly Earp...
- What happened to your accent?

I'm here with my sister and Doc Holliday.
Doc Holliday?

And some super fit secret agent, all to rescue... all to rescue Dolls.
- Dolls?

Agent Xavier Dolls?
Yes.

Yes, OK.
Here they come.
No, this is something else.

You must be yanking my vaJane.
These alarms are not good news for Waverly.
- I'm not leaving without Dolls.

They're already onto me.

Look, lady, cool it.

- You were saying?

Pretty easy from this side.

Well, hit it again!
- I'm coming with you!

And if he is no longer the raging asshole we know and respect,
I shall take care of it.
It's my turn, Wynonna.
You've had enough.
Was this your plan all along?
Now go, save the sister you've got left.
C'mon.

OK, if we don't get some real help, we're gonna get super eaten.
- Devourer of souls?

Bring it!
I thought you were good in your underwear.
You should see what I can do naked.
- Deputy Marshall?

You came alone?

Foolish.

Aw, hell.
Well, do you mind if I smoke?
No guns allowed.

Feels good to break the rules every now and then?
Indeed.
Dynamite is totally undetectable by your fancy metal wands.

I was there when they built the railroad.
One stick's enough to blow a rock face.

If that stuff's as old as it looks, it's...
Terribly unstable.

You're gonna blow us all up?

You're insane.
How do you like my moustache now?
Run.

Don't mind if I do.
- You wouldn't.

- I will shoot you.

Now, say you're sorry.
I'm sorry.
Not to me.
Don't kill her, Dolls!
If you do, this will all be over.
Whoa.

Whoa...

I don't think I can make it, though.
Well, you'd better, or I'll have two angry Earp sisters breathing down my throat.
Where d'you get all this dynamite from?
What happened to your hat?
- We are not gonna make it.

I'll take my chances.

God.
OK.

Hey, hey, hey!
Take me!

No.
No one's getting devoured.

Whoa, OK, what... what did you do?
Not today, Satan.
Are you sure you're not Scotland Yard?
Plan B. When you don't have a choice, and you gotta get rid of...

- Right?

Who are you?

- Wait, Dolls, where's Dolls?

Hey.
You kept one.
Yeah.

OK.
Don't need it.
No time to be stingy.

Can you please tell her?
I will.
- Dolls, you need to go!

Dolls, go!
- We got 'em!

Ma'am.

I do feel naked without it.
- Hold... still!

- We go down!

- Ride or die, dude!

Hey, Lucado.

- Someone mess with your shoulder pads?

You failed, Earp.

No, no!

Let them go.

I told them if they didn't help me, I...
I don't even know this guy!
- Jeremy, 'sup.

You can watch the rest of them die first.
- No!

Stand down, Agent Lucado.
- Good.

It's nothing, darlin'.

Sir, I can explain.

They did more than try.

Yes.
Doesn't make a lick of difference in the end.
- We'll find him.

Well, Xavier used his one freebie to save your little town from a nuclear mishap.
You were going to bomb Purgatory?
Seems you need to be reminded about your use of contraband weapons in general,
Agent Lucado.
Now yours.
You can pry Peacemaker from my cold dead hands.
I think I'll have one of the boys here do that for me.
So you brought your magic gun just in case there was a demon attack?
I brought my magic gun to remind you all that I'm the goddamn Earp heir and the only one who can send Wyatt's revenants back to hell.
I think revenants are the least of your problems.
Or haven't you seen any of the new beasts that have flooded Purgatory?
But yes, you will continue to patrol the Ghost.
River Triangle, and you will do it on behalf of Black Badge.

You can respectfully
- kiss my lily white ass.

I tried being a lawman.

This is treason.
And you're a dumpster fire.

- They're liars.

Somebody has to pay, Moody!

Someone will.
I can't kill the heir, but the rest of you are expendable.
Got it?
Agent Lucado, the contracts, please.
Hey.
You want us to sign in blood?
It's how it's done.

Who are you people?
Really?
Does it matter?
Don't talk to him any more.
Cheer up, Wynonna.
I'll sweeten the pot for you.
You play ball, I'll help you break the Earp Curse.
I already know how to break it.
Bobo Del Rey has been dispatched and his revenants are all scattered.
You'll never find and kill them all, not in your lifetime.
I'm being generous, Wynonna.

Lift your family's burden for good.
Now get them out of my house.
One more thing.

- in Purgatory?

I swear on our mother's grave.
Seriously, how stupid do you think we are?
He just... shot her.
God, I hope Nicole got out.
- Car's gone.

Good?

Doc...
Did Dolls... say any... did he tell you to...
- tell me anything?

I'm sorry you had to reup.
I know how much you hate being one of the good guys.
I highly doubt those were the good guys.
I finally got some dynamite and didn't even get to use it.
So...
I'm not great at thank yous.
You're still pretty great, though.
I'm not sure he deserved it.
Well, we so rarely get what we deserve.
You could come in.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Well, then I'll leave you to it.
I'm sorry I left.
No.

I wanted you to.

I didn't have a choice, right?
He would've killed you.
Or made it official.

In your own blood?
I better get back to the station.
I've still got so much paperwork to do.
Yeah, I...

So, what do we do now?
Find everything that got into the Ghost River Triangle and kill it.
So, the usual.
- Sounds messy.

Sounds fun.
What about Black Badge?

They should be scared of me.
Forget Black Badge.
Remember who the real enemy is.

Demons.
It's always demons.
You know you don't have to do this all alone.
That's just it.
No matter what they say, I only really have one job now.
Keeping my baby sister safe.
C'mon, Earp.
Let's go break a curse.
