(NARRATOR READING) *THE LION GUARD* Season 01 Episode 24
(KION READING) "O N O's I D O L"
Mtoto!
Where'd you go?
Mtoto?
Wait.
Do you hear that?
I don't hear anything.
(GASPS)
(SQUAWKING)
Are those birds?
A lot of birds.
(WHIMPERS)
You don't think they're vultures, do you?
Vultures?
You know who we need right now?
Hi, Beshte!
Hey, Mtoto!
That's an un-Bunga-lievable bunch of birds!
Look at that!
I've never seen so many birds in one place.
So what are they all doing here?
I bet Ono could tell us.
I got us a spot right in front!
In front of what?
Let's find out.
Can you believe he's really back?
After all this time?
Who-dithi?
Hadithi?
The legendary eagle?
Every bird in the Pride Lands has heard of him!
Uh, Ono, we aren't birds!
But you don't have to be a bird to have heard of Hadithi.
Creator of the Hadithi Spin?
Three mid-air loops and a corkscrew?
I think.
I've always wanted to ask Hadithi exactly how it goes.
And now I can.
If I can get up the nerve, that is.
He's kind of my idol.
He sounds Poa, Ono.
Oh, he is.
And smart.
They say whenever he speaks, nuggets of wisdom fall from his mouth.
Nuggets fall outta my mouth all the time.
(BIRDS SQUAWKING AND CHIRPING)
Greetings, my friends.
Say something wise, Hadithi!
The higher you fly, the more they'll look up to you.
"The higher you fly, the more they'll look up to you."
That is so deep.
Bunga, shh!
Ono really likes this guy!
Isn't he amazing?
Oh, yeah!
Hey, Ono.
Let's ask him about his spin thingie.
Yo, Hadithi!
Bunga!
You can't just talk to Hadithi.
He's the Raven Rescuer from Red Rocks.
The Starling Savior at Summer Springs.
Don't forget the Guardian of the Great Egret Escape.
Uh, Bunga?
Is Hadithi actually talking to me?
Indeed I am, young Egret.
You seem to know a lot about me.
Oh, I do, Hadithi.
Sir.
(CLEARS THROAT) In fact,
I would have to say I'm your biggest fan?
My biggest fan?
(CHUCKLES) Are you sure, young Egret?
As you can see, I have many.
♪ I'm not one for boasting
♪ But what they say is true!
♪ I happen to be the best at everything I do
♪ So what's the point of fighting the energetic crowd
♪ When they want to scream and shout
♪ And chant my name out loud
♪ Hadithi, the hero!
♪ Wherever I go
♪ Hadithi, the hero!
♪ They worship me so
♪ Hadithi, the hero!
♪ Oh, I must agree
♪ Hadithi, the hero!
♪ It's all about me!
♪ Ravens I have rescued
♪ Freed finches from the fray (YELPS)
♪ And the Egret's great escape
♪ Oh, that was a busy day
♪ But most of all I'm famous for that legendary wing
♪ Against 10 hungry crocodiles
♪ With my Hadithi spin
♪ Hadithi the hero!
♪ Wherever I go
♪ Hadithi the hero!
♪ They worship me so
♪ Hadithi the hero!
♪ Though I must agree
♪ Hadithi the hero!
♪ It's all about me
♪ Yes, I must truly be humbled
♪ By all my fanatical fans
♪ Yes, it's so hard to be humble
♪ But that's just the bird that I am
♪ That I am
♪ Hadithi the hero!
♪ Wherever I go
♪ Hadithi the hero!

(ANIMALS CHEERING)
Thank you so much!
You're the wind beneath my wings!
But you may just be my biggest fan after all.
Perhaps.
But don't forget.
You have fans all over the Pride Lands.
You honor me with your presence.
We're glad your travels have brought you back to the Pride Lands, Hadithi.
You've heard of Hadithi?
Oh, yes.
Hadithi is a hero to animals throughout the Pride Lands.
We all know, Hadithi is a bird who never thinks of himself.
Especially when an animal needs help.
When a hero like Hadithi returns to the Pride Lands, it is important for us to mark the occasion.
And this is why we'd like to honor you at Pride Rock with a Royal Mud Print ceremony.
A Royal Mud Print ceremony?
For me?
A Royal Mud Print ceremony!
Un-Bunga-lievable!
What's a Royal Mud Print ceremony?
Hadithi will press his talons into wet mud!
When it dries, his prints will be preserved forever alongside those of other heroes!
I've seen those prints!
But I've never seen the ceremony.
(LAUGHS) I can't think of anyone who deserves it more.
And as Guest of Honor, it is tradition that you share your great knowledge with a younger member of the Pride lands.
Now, who should it be?
Ah, perhaps, young Ono.
Me?
Is there anything else you need?
Oh, that's very kind of you, King Simba.
But, I don't need much.
Very well.
Although, uh, speaking of tradition, as guest of honor,
I assume that you'll be building me the traditional ceremonial nest?
The ceremonial nest?
But we've also never had a mud print ceremony for an eagle before.
That's true.
Birds do these things differently.
The Lion Guard would be honored to build the traditional ceremonial nest!
Uh...
Then we shall see you at the clearing by Pride Rock just before sundown for the ceremony.
Thank you, Lion Guard, for your kind offer.
Aw, what's a little favor among heroes?
I assume you know how to use the proper leaves for the nest.
The proper leaves?
In keeping with tradition, the ceremonial nest should be made of the leaves from the top of the tallest tree in the land.
Seriously?
Well, I don't just make up these traditions.
It makes sense, the fronds at the top are the softest.
Fit for a hero.
Exactly, Ono.
Maybe you do know what you're talking about.
Oh, uh, I do?
Of course, you do, Ono.
And while Ono spends time with Hadithi, the rest of us can go get the special leaves.
Right, guys?
Uh.
Just point me to the tallest tree.
It sure was nice of you to let Ono stay with Hadithi.
Shouldn't we be doing more important things than fetching leaves from the tallest tree?
For some eagle we've never heard of?
(CHUCKLES) But my Dad's heard of him.
Yeah!
And he's Ono's biggest hero!
The higher you fly, the more they'll look up to you.
That's all well and good for storks, but elephants don't fly.
I think what Hadithi is trying to say is, we all have challenges that require us to rise above ourselves.
To become better than we are.
Wise words, Hadithi.
Indeed.
I got this.
Zuka Zama!
(GRUNTING)
Whoo!
You guys should come up.
I can see everything from here!
Just get the leaves and come down!
But it's the tallest tree in the Pride Lands.
I can see Pride Rock.
I can see Mekundu Cliffs.
I can see the tallest tree in the Pride Lands.
Uh-oh.
Did he just say he could see the tallest tree in the Pride Lands?
(GROANS) Yep.
And everyone will look up to you.
Thank you for coming, everyone.
And don't forget my Royal Mud Print ceremony tonight at sundown.
Hadithi!
Hadithi!
Give Hadithi the respect he deserves!
Thank you, Ono.
It seems you're a natural, too.
I am?
Me?
In that case, do you think you could show me the Hadithi Spin?
Well, I'd rather not muss my feathers so close to the ceremony.
Why don't you show me, and I'll tell you if you're doing it right.
Uh, okay!
Great!
Three mid-air loops and a corkscrew.
Hadithi!
You watching?
One.
Two.
Three!
I, uh...
I think possibly I forgot to compensate for the wind.
Well, that's your mistake, the wind always compensates for me.
Oh...
You'll see, Hadithi, this time I'll get it!
Almost there, little B.
Ah!
I got an idea.
How about we put the ceremonial nest right here?
(CHUCKLES) I want to sit right up front.
Hey, birds only.
But we're Hadithi fans too!
That was very nice of you, Mtoto.
I don't mind, Beshte.
After all, you're still my number one hero!
Huh.
Lot of animals want to see Hadithi.
So, where is he?
One.
Almost there!
What do you think, Hadithi?
Hadithi?
You weren't even watching.
I'm sorry, but I have to look my best!
It wouldn't do for my fans to have their hero show up looking like he just came in from a windstorm!
Although, it might make me look even more heroic.
I doubt that.
Time to go!
A natural with the crowd.
You give them what they want.
You play them perfectly.
Play them?
What do you mean?
You always tell them exactly what they want to hear!
I do?
But, I'm just being honest.
Being honest.
Oh, isn't that interesting.
(GASPS)
Hadithi!
Klipspringers in trouble!
On the rocks just below.
Klipspringers are excellent climbers.
They got up there, I'm sure they can get down.
I suppose.
I guess you guys will be fine.
(HYENAS LAUGHING) ONO: (GASPS) Hyenas?
They've got the klipspringers cornered!
A whole hyena clan?
We can take 'em out with the Hadithi Spin!
And, I wouldn't want you to get hurt.
Especially so close to my ceremony.
Speaking of which, come on.
We're going to be late.
But, the hyenas.
Can't keep my fans waiting.
Guess it's up to me.
(ALL ANIMALS CHEERING)
Welcome, Hadithi.
Thank you, King Simba.
Very soft.
Yes, this will do.
Where's Ono?
He's, uh, still trying to get the Hadithi Spin right.
I'm sure he'll be along shortly.
The legendary Hadithi.
(ANIMALS CHEERING)
As you all know, Hadithi is a true hero.
A brave bird, who always answers the call.
When someone needs help,
Hadithi never thinks of himself.
He thinks of others, no matter what.
(BLEATING)
What's the matter, klipspringers?
No place to go?
(LAUGHS)
Yeah!
Good one!
(LAUGHS) It's funny 'cause it's true!
Uh-oh.
The Lion Guard?
(SNICKERS) No.
It's just little Ono.
All by himself.
Ignore him!
You asked for it.
Time for the Hadithi Spin.
One.
Two.
Oof!
(SCREAMS)
(YELPS)
(GROANS) Oh, no!
(STRAINING)
It's no use.
I'm stuck.
(CHUCKLES) Ooh, Janja!
Sounds like we're gonna have klipspringer with a side of Ono!
You go ahead, boys.
I'll round up the main course.
Oh.
And once Hadithi presses his talon into the mud, we can all be reminded of his bravery.
His strength.
And his selflessness.
The sacrifice a true hero always makes to help others.
And there are few heroes as true as the one we have here.
Hadithi!
(ANIMALS CHEERING)
Ready?
Remember, the higher you fly, the more they'll look up...
Aw, who am I kidding?
You shouldn't look up to me!
But I know a bird who is!
And he's in trouble!
Ono!
Lion Guard, follow me!
Till the Pride Lands ends...
(STRAINING) Come on.
(GROANS)
(HYENAS LAUGHING)
(GRUNTING)
I'd back off if I were you.
(LAUGHS)
What for?
We know you're all alone, Ono.
I wouldn't be so sure about that!
I don't think he's all alone no more.
(SNARLS) You got that right.
Run!
Let's get you out from under there.
Don't worry about me, Fuli.
Go help the klipspringers!
You got it.
Amazing.
Even when you're trapped, you're still more concerned about others.
I think I could learn from you.
You're a true hero, Ono.
Thank you, Hadithi.
Sorry I left you behind, Ono.
Well, I'm sure you had a good reason.
Ono, it's time you knew the truth.
The truth?
None of the stories about me are true.
That day at Misty Falls?
I fell out of the sky.
There's no Hadithi Spin.
There never was.
Right about the time I crashed trying to do the Hadithi Spin.
Oh.
But, it doesn't mean there can't be one now!
Follow me, Hadithi!
Here we go.
(BLEATING) (GROWLING)
How're you going to stop me, Kion?
I'm between you and the klipspringers.
Yeah, but, we're between you and the way off this cliff.
Right.
There's so much here to eat.
Not for long.
Now, Beshte!
Come on, klipspringers!
Follow me!
You can't get away that easy!
(YELLING)
(GRUNTING)
(LAUGHING)
Sorry, Janja!
Cheezi pushed me!
Fast as you can, little klippies!
(BLEATS)
What?
Whoa!
Come on, Hadithi!
This is fun!
(STAMMERS) Wait, did he say "Hadithi"?
ONO: (WHOOPING) Yeah.
(ONO LAUGHING)
Poa!
I don't know who's more impressive, Ono or Hadithi!
I do!
Go, Ono!
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
I think I'm gonna lose my lunch!
(SCREAMING)
Who was that big guy with the feathers?
Don't you know nothin'?
That was Hadithi, the legendary eagle!
We got beat by a legend?
(LAUGHING)
(JANJA GROANS)
I was supposed to pass my wisdom on to you.
But instead, you passed some wisdom onto me.
You know why, kid?
'Cause you're a natural.
A natural hero.
(ANIMALS CHEERING)
Way to go, Ono!
Animals of the Pride Lands, I give you
Ono the Egret, creator of the Ono Spin.
(ANIMALS CHEERING)
