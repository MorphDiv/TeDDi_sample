Three Years Later constitutional president of the United States of Mexico.
From December 1st, 1988, to November 30th, 1994...
Attorney at law,
United States of Mexico constitutional president will speak to the people.
I affirm... to loyally execute... my job as President of the Republic given to me by the people... always safeguarding the unión's wellbeing.
If I fail to comply with this task... may my country demand it from me.
MMH Administration Of Frauds
Honorable Congress of the Unión... citizens of Mexico... with emotion and conviction...
I've promised to protect our constitution...
I feel the warmth from my boiling blood
I feel the fear sweat dripping away
There's a stillness that nothing transmits
I am a breeze that grows stronger
Even when the clouds drift away
Even when my skin dries away
I'll be back someday
To unleash my return
I have the dust that protects the road
I have the branches of a leafless tree
I'm the guardian of the tired night
There are silhouettes that come to meet me
Even when the clouds drift away
Even when my skin dries away
I'll be back someday
To unleash my return
Who the fuck do you think you are?
Ramón!
It's me, it's me, it's me!
How are you, Chapo?
What did he do?
I didn't like his haircut.
Toño Chapo'S Gunman
Cut it out, Ramón.
Weed, how much?
Blow.
I like my plants better, Chapo.
They're cheaper.
But it won't last.
Sooner or later, it will be legalized.
Whoever controls the marijuana business wins.
Maybe.
But for now, Yankees want blow.
What are you thinking?
Tijuana's the best place to cross the border.
And I'm the best man for the job.
Let's be partners.
You open your territory for me, and I do the crossing.
We all win.
Why do you like to complicate things, fucker?
Meaning?
You know how it is, Chapo, how it will always be.
If we eventually turn to coke, we'll use Amado, not you.
No offense, Chapo, but bosses only deal with bosses.
I don't care what they said.
We'll cross their territory, and they won't know a thing.
Benjamín And Ramón Avendaño Tijuana Bosses
I need someone trustworthy to cross Tijuana.
The Avendaños know nothing about this job.
Joaquín, are you sure?
If someone can do it... it's you.
Rayo, the small cans are good.
The big cans have the merch.
We're fucked.
Those are Avendaño's men.
Park it here.
We have to check the trucks.
Show me a can.
Here, boss.
Open up.
No, no, wait, boss.
Don't open that one, I'll lose two kilos.
It's double the money.
There you go.
Next time, I'll bring some crackers for the boys, okay?
Please close the doors, I don't want the cans to get dirty.
Okay, off you go.
Los Ángeles, California Mr. Cheto'S Warehouse
Now you'll see, Don Cheto.
Well done, bud.
Tough blow for the Avendaños.
You say the word, I'll get my hands dirty.
Alejandra'S House Chapo'S First Wife
Hello.
A little something from the Avendaños.
I don't get you.
Those two are ready.
You have enough money, but you go and do this.
Trying to fuck with the Avendaños.
What are you talking about?
They know nothing about this.
You want revenge because they belittled you.
Am I wrong?
Official Residence Mexico City
Conrado Higuera Sol.
Secretary for the Labor Party presidency.
General Blanco National Security Consultant
You come highly recommended.
But even if the Pope told me you were the man for the job,
I'll decide what to do with you.
You were told the position is for internal communication consultant.
Your job would be to be my slave.
Any problems with that?
I have to choose between you and another man like you.
Both graduated college with honors and all that shit.
Why should I choose you?
Because I want to be president.
And I don't mind starting as an ass-kisser.
Construction begins for first maximum security prison
Wake him up.
Boss.
Boss.
Don Miguel Ángel.
What?
Don Miguel Ángel on the phone.
Miguelón.
Okay, give me a minute.
"Construction begins for the first maximum security prison.
The president's first step was to start building the first Mexican maximum security prison..."
"Almoloya's Federal Center for Social Readaptation."
Why the fuck is he building a maximum security prison?
Did something change since this guy came into power?
No.
Boss.
Be careful with that fucker, Miguel.
After Colombia, he thinks he's a big deal.
And there's more.
15 million for the organization.
Take them inside.
I know how useful you are, Chapo.
Why don't you tell me what you want?
Take the car.
I deserve this, Miguel Ángel.
Take it before I forget how much money you make me.
Graciela'S House Chapo'S Second Wife
What happened?
Official Residence Mexico City
Excuse me, Mr. President.
DEA Chief Mexico
Downtown.
Don Amado, please.
Would you do us the honor of giving a speech?
Okay, okay.
To continue with our celebration, we'll make a toast to the lovely couple...
Who don't know what's awaiting them...
Or everyone dies.
Disarm them!
Take him.
Don't move!
Uncuff him.
I'm not Amado... but if you had called me, I'd have come.
Not if you knew you wouldn't be allowed to leave again.
There are deals in place.
That's in the past.
Fucking traitors.
That's why the newbie ordered that prison to be built.
He wants to change the rules.
Miguel Ángel put the meeting together.
So we'll meet with the real bosses this time?
That's what Güero said.
I think you made it, pal.
Don't jinx me, asshole.
Buddy.
How are you, Güerito?
Your cooperation.
We can't set you free, but you'll have a good time in prison.
Hello, Mr. Emilio.
Mr. Emilio.
Emilio Quintero Payán Boss
Good to see you, Joaquín.
Rafael Aguilar Guajardo Boss
What if I refuse?
We'll extradite you to the United States.
And the Avendaños?
They sent Don Chuy on their behalf.
Don Chuy The Avendaños' Uncle
Their uncle.
Hello, everyone.
How are you, Rafael?
Don Ismael Boss
Beer, son.
Good morning, Mr. Ismael.
I hope Mrs. Rosaura is feeling better.
She's better, thanks.
My Quino's the same age as your boy.
Always playing soccer.
Same as my Mayelito.
Good to see you, Joaquín.
Thank you for coming.
Everyone, please come in.
Livas Miguel Ángel'S Lawyer
Don Miguel Ángel sends his regards.
As you know, this meeting has been called on his behalf so we can reorganize the business after his arrest.
But before we start, Miguel Ángel wants you to meet the person who'll be in charge from now on.
Good morning, everyone.
What's this, Livas?
Please, sit.
We'll distribute Miguel Ángel's territories by mutual agreement with the federal government.
Everyone, calm down.
Don Miguel's orders.
Please, sit.
División of territories.
Chihuahua and Nuevo Laredo will be managed by Rafael Aguilar Guajardo, who will also control Ciudad Juárez on behalf of Amado.
Sinaloa... to Ismael.
The Avendaños will be in charge of Tijuana.
Nogales and Hermosillo will now be managed by Emilio Quintero Payán.
San Luis Río Colorado goes to Heriberto Palma.
Rafael Chao will control Mexicali.
And Tecate... is now Joaquín Guzmán Loera's...
Mexican United States who, from this day forward... will be recognized as a boss.
Joaquín Guzmán Loera Boss
To Miguel Ángel, who's in jail, but did a good deed.
He should've made me boss when I asked him to.
Miguel Ángel is fucked.
But me?
I'm unstoppable now.
Cheers!
Hi, sweetie.
Quino, be careful, son.
Hold this.
Ale, the tray.
You still mad?
Hello, everyone.
Be careful or she'll get jealous.
Dad!
Son!
Go play with your brother.
Come here.
There's some meat if the boy's hungry.
Later, when they stop playing.
Need a hand?
Asshole.
For you.
Hello.
Hello?
Congrats, Chapito.
Benjamín told me to invite you to Ismael's birthday party.
In Tijuana?
Yeah, it will be a huge party.
Bring a good present, asshole.
I got another job for you, pal.
You'll go on my behalf, so buy a very nice present.
Tell the Avendaños I'm sorry, I had a family emergency or something, but make it good.
Why can't you make it?
Because we have work to do.
Don't fuck this up.
You wanted to be a boss so bad, and now you won't enjoy it?
You're wrong, Güero.
I want to enjoy everything.
But the more power I have, the more I'll enjoy it.
You have to walk before you start running, pal.
Easy does it.
His men have no leader.
Rayo will go to the party, and we'll recruit Miguel's men before someone else does it.
If you tell me what you need,
Easy, easy, everyone!
We just want to talk to your boss.
Boss.
Nobody move!
We just want to talk.
Your boss is in jail, yes or no?
Well, yes.
It's your choice.
Stay on the losing side and keep working for Miguel Ángel, or come work for me on the winning side.
I'm sorry, boss, but I can't ditch Miguel Ángel that easily.
But I'm more scared of him.
From now on, you work for me.
Here you go.
All the evidence Mr. Miguel Ángel spent years gathering.
Governor Of Sinaloa
Bribes to politicians, the army, everyone he bought.
Well, you've got what you were looking for.
We don't want no trouble.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That your guards are waiting to kill us.
But we aren't leaving alone.
Let's go.
This way.
Hey!
Put the guns down.
Easy, pal.
Grab the briefcase.
Well, look at that.
Rayo López.
You're a sight for sore eyes, sweetie.
But even if I wasn't, with you here, I'd change hotels in no time.
So, want to have a drink?
And you can tell me what you're doing here.
Happy birthday, Don Ismael!
Do you remember our boy?
Lobito?
Don't be like that, asshole.
It's a present for a party I'm going to.
Tell me about that party.
You'll have to see it to believe me.
But I think that can be arranged, don't you?
Cheers.
Whoever did this came for whatever was in there.
General, one of the guards is still alive.
He saw everything.
It was Guzmán Loera, El Chapo.
That asshole Chapo isn't here yet.
Güero is late, too.
Slow down with the alcohol, Ramón.
I want a quiet night.
Rayo, did you really have to come?
Let's go.
What's up?
What's your name?
Armando López, but they call me Rayo.
I'm gonna ask you to leave.
I said, leave.
Armando, stop it.
Listen to your woman, asshole.
Don't tell me what to do, fucker.
I'm here on behalf of Chapo Guzmán, move.
No, no, stop it!
Stop it now!
I don't give a fuck about that asshole.
Stop this now!
I'm here on behalf of Chapo.
Who the fuck does he think he is, sending a cheap drunk?
Send this to Chapo.
Ramón!
Follow me, please.
For your troubles, Doctor.
They belittle me and then kill my man.
This is the end of the Avendaños, Güero.
I believe we should kill hm.
Go ahead.
With all due respect, Mr. President... the bosses see General Blanco as an imposed leader.
They didn't choose him.
If we kill one of them so soon, the balance we have now could be disrupted.
What's your name?
Conrado Higuera Sol, Mr. President.
Due to his lack of experience, Mr. Sol can't understand that you don't ask the drug lords for their opinion.
You give them orders, and they must follow them.
If they don't, you kill them.
You're both right.
Control that Chapo.
But do it... without violence.
Like Mr. Sol suggested.
Of course, sir.
I'm sorry, General.
It was careless of me.
Because if it does, you'll be dining with maggots.
