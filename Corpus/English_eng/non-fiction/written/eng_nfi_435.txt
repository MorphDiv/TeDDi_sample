Evan, I know you're nervous about your first grown-up haircut, but you're in safe hands with Reuben.
He's the best in the biz.
I used to cut Gregory Hines' hair.
So what will it be today, Louis?
Well, with Chinese New Year coming up, we're gonna need extra fresh cuts.
Better make it two usuals.
Actually, I'll have the "Randy."
The who?
Randy from "Home Improvement."
You know, Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
Is that one person or three people?
One, but with the talent of three.
Okay, your haircut, your choice.
One usual and one "Randy," please.
A usual and a "Randy," coming up.
I hope we don't run into any balloons on our way home because we are gonna look sharp.
Thanks, Reuben.
See, what did I tell you?

Art thou the bird who man loves best?
The pious bird with the scarlet breast.
Is that a "Yes, I returned Marvin's birdfeeder"
or a "No, I didn't return Marvin's birdfeeder"?
Yes, I returned it.
Good, Louis is clean.
That just leave you boys, with the exception of Emery, who is clean all year round.
I don't get why we're going through all this trouble for a holiday.
Having a clean slate is an important part of the lunar New Year.
All debts, disputes, and grudges have to be resolved in order to ensure good fortune for the coming year.
Mom's just looking out for future us.
Well, she better also be looking our for Mariah Carey because that's who the future me is married to.
I'm gonna marry Jewel.
Stay away from Jewel.
Evan, did you settle things with Carol-Joan after your incident?
And so the bartender says, "Why the big pause?"
And the bear says...
"I don't know.

I apologized with a fig basket.
- It's done.

Eddie, did you care for Grandma's flowers like I asked you to?
Care for them?
I spoiled them.
Turns out, they love Mr. Pibb.
Technically, it's still alive, so good enough.
_
Second cousin Susan?
You've been in a fight with her for 30 years.
_
Louis, do you know what this means?
This could be the first time our entire family has a clean slate for the New Year!
Imagine what that kind of good fortune could mean for our future business dealings and scratch-offs.
But, Mom, you've never had a clean slate.
You always end up getting into a fight with somebody.
You're kind of a loose cannon.
A loose cannon downs more ships.
- I don't...

This year, to ensure success,
I am putting myself on lock down.
If I don't leave the house, I can't get into any fights.
Really?

I've already run all my errands, paid all my debts, settled my disputes, and had enough time to rent "Courage Under Fire."
Um...
Who is that?
_
_
_
Very... _
_
Simon, welcome.
Eddie will take good care of you.
Me?

He's basically a big Evan.

Welcoming family is an important New Year's tradition.
He is your new "Grandma's flowers."
Don't let him die.

Uh...

Oh, Evan, hi.

I have a problem.
The letter was right here, stamped and addressed, and now it's gone.
So?

You don't understand.

You sent hate mail?
I was gonna send it after the New Year, but then someone went and mailed it.
Now Reuben's gonna read it today, and I'll have bad luck for the entire year.
Evan, relax.
I'm sure whoever...
Wait.
Reuben who?
You know, Reuben.
Your barber?

♪ Mine are Magic, I Shaq it ♪
♪ You tryin' to kill me in a battle?

Ooh!
Ooh!

- Eddie!

What are you doing?
Get in here and take care of your cousin.
I found him reading an old MAD magazine.
I was teaching him about America through humor.
"Dunces with Wolves."
Genius.
That's your cousin?
Is he cool?
His shorts almost touch his nipples.
What if he reads your letter and won't cut my hair anymore?
Or he tells the other barbers?

Do you know how hard it is to find a good barber?
It's like dating but for your hair.
He's not that good, Dad.
I mean, look at this mess.
I asked for a "Randy," and he gave me a "Brad."
Nobody knows who those people are!
I've been going to Reuben since we moved to Orlando.
I can't start over and find somebody new.
Maybe he won't know who sent it.
I signed the letter...

Oh, really?
What else did it say?
It said, "You don't know how to cut Asian hair.
I asked for a 'Randy, ' and you gave me a 'Brad.'"
Evan, he's gonna know that's us!
Put your shoes on.
We've got to get that letter back before it ruins the New Year for the both of us.
Ugh!
Well, good thing I'm wearing my movie jeans and not my lucky red...
Emery...
- I need your help.

I forgot to pick up my lucky red dress from the dry cleaner's...
The one I've worn every New Year's since I retired my women's-powersuit- dragon-broach combo in 1989.
And, let me guess, you want me to make you a new one.
What?

No, I want you to come to the dry cleaner's with me
- to pick it up.

Because I want to make it to New Year's dinner with a clean slate, and I don't trust myself out there alone.
So you want me to be your kindness Sherpa, your karma spirit guide, your bodyguard for...
Enough examples, but yes.
You get along with everybody, so I'm just gonna follow your lead.
No more loose cannon.
Don't worry, Mom.
Just put your hand on my shoulder, and I'll guide you, like a seeing eye dog except...
I'll wait outside.
Hey!

We brought it back from New Mexico.
Too big for the overhead, so we had to check them.
If the wind blows just right, they play the intro to "Jack  Diane."
Emery, go get my step ladder and the big scissors I use to cut meat.
We love them!
Wind chimes are nature's instrument.
What are you doing?
Those pipes sound like somebody let an octopus loose in the Williams-Sonoma.
I know, Mom, but if you're gonna stay clean today, you're gonna need to control your temper.
I'm your kindness Sherpa, remember?
Yes, you're right.
But just so you know, as soon as the New Year is over,
I'm going to steal those chimes and drop them in the bottom of the ocean.
I know you will, Mom.
- Hide them where no one can find them.

Wrap them in chains, drive them to the pier, and then I'm gonna drop them off...
Mom!

Ding-dong!

Are you sure I'm controlling the Koopas?
Yeah, yeah, I told you, I control Mario, and you control the Koopas and the Boos.
It's how the game works.
Hey, what'd you do that for?
_
_
Grandma, what does it look like I'm doing?
He's having fun.
_
_
Grandma, that's a great idea.
I know just the place.
Hey, Simon.
Have you ever... built a bear?
I built a miniature model of the Titanic once for history class.
I used Tic Tacs for the life boats.
Uh-huh.
Well, here, you build a bear.
All the cool kids do it.
Okay, do you want to build one together?
We can make it a blend of both of us.
What boy names do you like?

It's kind of something you do by yourself.
Like, the bear chooses you.

Have fun.
And then you just hand the dry cleaner your ticket, smile, and I'll handle the rest.
He calls me "Jessie."
You know that?

Like I'm a German shepherd.
You can do this.

All we have to do is walk over there and...
Uh-oh.
Hello, can you spare any change today to save the whales?
Okay, new plan.
I go in alone and get your dress.
- What do I do?

And with that, Coney Island was born.
The boardwalk, the cotton candy, and, of course, La Marcus Thompson's switchback gravity railway.
You know what?
I am relaxed.
- I'll be back in five minutes.

- Stay in the car and lock the doors.

The island itself?
Named for all the Coneys, or rabbits...
Reuben always goes on break at 1:30.
He'll head to the back to eat a yogurt, and we can duck in and see if the letter's been delivered yet.
How will we know?
Reuben always gets the new issue of Sports Illustrated in the mail.
If the new issue's on the counter, that means the mail has been delivered, and it's too late.
If it's still last week's, we're okay.
Now's our chance.

"America's Top 50 Jock Schools."
Is that this week's or last week's?
I only read "Zillions."
Last week's, which means the mail hasn't been...
Louis.
What are you doing here?
Oh.
We're here because, um, Evan needs another haircut.
Thanks, Reuben, great work as always.
This is great.

Great?

I look like Grace Jones.

Hey, cousin Eddie.
You were right about that place.

You can design your bear's shirt and everything.

- That was so cool.

- That was so cool.

And that's where I met my husband, right there on the boardwalk.

He was an engineer on the Cyclone, and I sold cotton candy at the...
Hello.
Can you spare any change today to save the whales?
Yes.
You owe me another $5.
I gave a $20.
No, you gave me a $10.
You owe me another $5.
Oh, now you're in for it, buddy.
Mom, this guy's a liar, and he's trying to steal my money.
Emery, just pay the man what he says you owe him.
What?
Me?
But he's a liar.
You come into my store and call me a liar?
That's it.
You're going on the wall.
Aren't you gonna say anything?
Great, now how are people going to know we do shoes?
Why didn't you stick up for me?

Of course, I believe you.
We're supposed to be avoiding conflicts, not starting new ones.
Last week, you yelled at a bus driver for not wearing his hat.
But the one time I need you to get angry for me, you leave me hanging?
You care more about your holiday superstitions than you do about me.
No.

I just want our whole family to start out the New Year on the right foot for once.
That is worth $5 to me.
So please, just go in there and give that man his money.
No way.
You know, $5 could de-barnacle a whole pod.
Okay, now let's go over the plan again.
I pretend to lose my car keys down this grate, then when the mailman comes to help me,
I hit the mail out of his hands, you grab the letter and rip it up.
Isn't holding up a mailman worse than just sending an angry letter?
Can we just ask for it back?
Have you ever tried reasoning with a mailman, son?
You can't.

Oh.

Uh, my keys have fallen down this grate.
- Oh, no.

Now!
What'd you do that for?
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

Now!
Will you stop doing that?
Everything okay, Louis?
Looks like you're trying to assault a federal employee.
Assault?
Oh, no.
I just, uh...

Look, I'm late for a bamitzvah, so I'm gonna let you off with a warning.
Just, you know, be cool.
There goes my relationship with Reuben.
We didn't get the letter back, and I have a terrible haircut.
My year of bad luck has already begun.
So you didn't exactly get the haircut you wanted.
I didn't like my haircut when I first went to Reuben.
I wanted the "Clooney," but he gave me this.
After a while, I got used to it.
Why'd you keep going back to him if it wasn't what you wanted?
I don't know.

He called me "Big Guy."
I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Plus, it's a good haircut.
But it could be a great haircut.
You said that finding the right barber was like dating.
Would you have settled for anyone less than Mom?
No.
You deserve the "Clooney," Dad.
We all do.
Looks like we're getting a storm.
That's right, girls.
Sing for your supper.
Are you sure?

Nope.

You owe me another $5.
Not you again.
I am here to make things right for my son.
This is the extra $5 he owes you.
I apologize for his behavior.
And I ask that you take his photo down from your shame wall so he can start out the New Year with a clean slate.
Apology accepted.
But only because I need the business.
My wife has... expensive tastes.
- My son's photo, please.

Thank you.
And now you're going to want to take my picture.
Why would I want to take...

You're going to want to take my picture.
- Hey.

What you did back there...
It...

I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

I'm the one who should be saying sorry for the way I treated you.
You're not mad that I embarrassed you?
I was just mad because you were so good.
I mean, you rhymed "balance" with "allowance."
You're amazing, dawg.
How'd you get so dope at freestyling?
I love hip-hop.
How come you never said anything?
You never asked.
Hmm.
For real though, you could become a famous rapper one day.
Rap's just a hobby for me.
My real passion is marine biology.
Do you see any Asian rappers in here?
Me neither.
You have a gift.
You have a chance to change the game.
I'll think about it.
Come on.
How did you get this?
I'm sorry for not having your back.
I get it.
It's Chinese New Year, and you wanted to start clean.
It's not just that.
I didn't stand up for you because I don't want to set that kind of example for you.
I don't want to teach you that fighting is always the answer.
But u fight with, like, everybody...
Delivery guys, firemen, the cat outside the frozen yogurt place.
Yes.
And you're good.
And you get along with everybody.
And you're always smiling.
I don't want you to be more like me.
I want to be more like you.
I've witnessed the softening of the hardest of hearts by a simple smile.
Goldie Hawn said that.
Goldie... also sounds like a dog's name.
_
_
What happened to your hair?
Tried out a new barber.
He finally gave me exactly what I asked for...
The "Clooney."
You hate it, don't you?
So much.
But at least now I know.
Like I know sending that letter won't bring me bad luck because it wasn't hate mail, it was truth mail.
You did it, Mom.
You made it to the New Year with a clean slate.
Yeah...
Uh, orange and full of juice.
Um... an orange?
The color of my first car.
Tan!
Powder blue!
Electric plum!
You're shouting in my ear.
It's tangerines.

I couldn't write my book report because of my arm.
That's not the arm you use to write with.
Can't sneak anything past you, Mom.
"Tale of Two Cities." You loved it.
Hey, that's mine.
Far too brilliant to use only once, darling.
"I forgot my food-drive donation."
Oh!

Was my lunch.

Anything you need, Ray?
Nothing, and this actually isn't bad.

Gonna be on time for carpooling duty.
I'm making every green light.

Well, before it was red, it was green, Ray.
Attitude is everything.
Keep it moving.

Keep it moving, please.

All the way up to the orange cones.

I thought people hated this job.
I mean, volunteer hours to boss around strangers.

I was gonna offer you this, but doesn't seem like you need it.

I got him, honey.
Mom, insulted but impressed.
You are in the zone.
Yeah, you know what?

Sickness!

We got a sneezer.

What the hell's going on?
You sneezed into your hands like a barbarian.
Am I not supposed to?
Kenneth!
Oh, are you trying to kill us?

You just told me not to sneeze into my hands.
Sneeze into your elbow.
I mean, not the elbow...

But the inside elbow, the...

The...

Thanks, Kenneth, the woman was on a roll, and now she can't even remember the name for a chelidon.
A sniffle can really take out a family like ours.
JJ takes a little bit longer to recover.
We like to be cautious.
Please take your leave.

Come back when you have been symptom-free for 24 hours.
Maya, are you serious?
Ugh!

I know that was a bit harsh.
If he survives, he'll understand.
So, someone's gonna need to read JJ's board today.
I'll do it.
Great chance for me to check out the classes
I'll be taking next year.
I'll do it.

I like her reason better."
Geez, upperclassmen sure do like to give each other back massages.
Are they that sore?
Hey, sweetie, if you got a sprain up there, that guy's doing a lot more harm than good.
Let me give you the number to my sports medicine guy.
He's the best.
Yeah?
Hey, I should probably sharpen my pencil in case anyone tries to give me a back rub.
I'll be right back.
Hey, get in line, los...

Go ahead.
Wait.

No.
I'm here with JJ.
As a sibling!

Hi, single.

Oh, my God.

I got to go.

"You seem weird."
What?

Forever.
Right, does everyone got their backpacks, their lunches?
Uh-oh.

Uh-oh.

I'm fine.

Oh, relax!

Ohh, I'm so cold.
I just...

Oh, so nice and warm inside this dead bear.
