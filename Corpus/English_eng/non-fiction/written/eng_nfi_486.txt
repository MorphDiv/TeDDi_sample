Previously on "Quantico"...
Anybody wanting to attack America just got a huge windfall.
I'm forming a select team to fight it.
My fiancée says I'm too tough on you.
Maxine Griffin, founder of The Roster.
If you want me to drop the story, then you give me something else to take its place.
- Hello?

Well, how about you buy me dinner?
- I don't pay for stories.

I'm sorry.

You could stay here, join us.
- You're nothing.

León, it's Shelby Wyatt.
Thought I'd call and see how you were.
Wow.
Good morning to you, too.
- Mm.

You say that like I'm the one that keeps leaving.
Mm.
It it were up to me,
I would be with you all day, every day.
Save it for the vows.
You know, assuming you're not gonna get called away during those, too.
I would never do that.
A runaway groom.

Sorry.
_
And he's leaving again.
Are we gonna talk about this new job of yours?
Let me rephrase that.
Okay, let's talk about this new job of yours right now.
You're still a strategist, right?
- I plead the fifth.

And now you're lying?
What are you saying, that I can't have this job and marry you?
I'm saying that I can't be with somebody that doesn't trust me.
When all this is over,
I will be able to tell you everything.
Until them, how about the trust going both ways and you trust me?
Give me a reason.

I love you.

_
- Looks like I am the welcome committee.

Well, I thought there'd be a big banner or some home-cooked lasagna, at least.
I mean, isn't that what you people do?
What, you mean FBI agents or clandestine task forces?
You know, no one welcomed me here, but Alex said it was mandatory that you feel at home.
Well, I already lived here, so...
Hmm.

I'm welcomed.
Great.
It's nice having you here.
Make yourself useful, and help me with this trace.
Well, I was on my way to the gym.
Did you sleep?
This is more important than sleeping.
Is everything okay?
I'm fine.
Help or leave.
All right.

Wish we could all have dinner, but we're off to Savannah.
Next time you're in Delhi.
Of course.
It was so lovely to see you again, Mira.
Bye.

Bye.

Cute family.
Yeah.
An old friend from an old life.
She asked a lot of questions.
I gave a lot of vague answers.
Yeah.
It's hard to reconnect when everything I do is a secret.
You know what's so strange?
She knows me, but there's nothing that connects us other than our past.
It's like we existed in two separate universes...
Me in my crazy one and she in her...
Normal one?
Is that what you want?

Doesn't even matter.
We should go.
They'll be waiting for us.
Where's Dayana?
On a case going to federal court.
If she didn't show, her cover could get blown.
But she didn't say goodbye.
Yeah.

I'm so happy you're here.
I'd like to bring something to everyone's attention.
My hope is that Sean Gregory's Ponzi scheme coming to light just weeks after our visit is merely coincidence.
But if I discover that someone on this team has been talking, you're not only jeopardizing this entire operation, but you could get us killed.
That said, we need to keep moving forward.
We can thank Nimah for catching this latest ping.
Normally, we have to wait for something to happen.
Not this time.
Whoever accessed our cache of stolen surveillance got sloppy, downloading to a cellphone, thus revealing herself quickly...
Rebecca Sherman of New York City.
The socialite?
Her taste, personal network, and dinner parties are legendary.
Everyone from Janet Yellen to Jay Z.
She's a power broker.
She can summon influential people in a room and get them talking, even when no amount of official diplomacy has worked.
Okay, and what did she exactly access from the cache?
Classified Intel on vulnerabilities in U.S. passport control.
But she hasn't put any of it to use yet.
So, for the first time, we have a chance to get ahead of a collaborator before they act?
Exactly.

Shelby, thank you for offering to utilize your asset there, but we were able to trace it to Rebecca.
Who's your asset in Riyadh?
I thought I could reach out to Samar.
Samar?
The woman who conned you into believing she was your sister for 15 years, Shelby?
Are you crazy?
It was just a thought.
I-I don't want to diminish this woman or her groundbreaking work with seating arrangements and artisanal cocktails, but are we all agreed here that there is no way she's a pillar of some global conspiracy?
No.

According to my research into our two identified collaborators, Roarke and Kelly,
Rebecca is connected to both.
Her contacts include very powerful people from all walks of life.
What if...

What if Sherman's the connective tissue?
Really?

I really appreciate the thought you've put into this, but it's kind of absurd.
I wasn't aware it was our job to convince you.
Well, my apologies for taking a contrary opinion.
If this theory is correct, then Rebecca could be the key to unlocking identities of every collaborator.
We need to figure out a way to get all her information.
But how?
You don't get to be as famous as her without being a locked box.
So, she works with people of note, right?
She hosts dinners, plans parties, weddings, even.
You want to use me... as bait?
Okay.

No.

You and your fiancée are planning the highest-profile wedding of the year.
You reach out to Rebecca, make the intro.
She would never think it's under false pretenses.
This is a good idea.
- This is a bad idea.

Because, like the rest of us, you'll finally have some real skin in the game?
This is more than skin.

Please respect that my life is my life.
I want Max as far away from this as possible.
Okay, so that's that then, is it?
- Hmm?

- Harry, stop.

You all put your lives at risk every day, and he risks nothing.
You have no idea what I have on the line here.
Clay, if there were any other way...
Maxine can't find out.
All right.

She's the event planner for your wedding.
Entrée into her Manhattan townhouse is the first step.
I bend the truth in my profession, but with Max, I don't lie.
Ever.
But the key here is not to focus on the lie.
Focus on what the lie gets you.
What makes you so equipped to give me this advice?
I had to manipulate Raina for her own safety at the G20.
And how's that working out for you and her?
We're closer than ever.
I knew you were lying.
And you sent the text.
After Maxine agrees to meet, she and Clay will go to Rebecca's home, accompanied by Alex, acting as a member of Clay's private security team.
Rebecca Sherman's gonna recognize you...
- Thank you.

You'll draw her in.
Yeah.
Hey.
Is your head into this?
Sorry.

And what is it I need to get the information?
You need to access Rebecca's personal computer.
Not hard to do once we've obtained the password.
Okay, so, Rebecca's old-school.
Her computer's closer to a Commodore than a MacBook, which means she'll have a rudimentary password.
That's the good news.
The bad news is, we can't hack it remotely, so we'll have to use good, old-fashioned human intelligence instead.
Sasha Barinov.
The same reporter who exposed the Ponzi scheme.
Yes.

She's written a bunch about Sherman's soirées.
She could help us get what we need.
I could pay her a visit, get her to help without her even knowing, and get to the bottom of who leaked the Gregory story.
Hmm.
Maxine's in.
She said she's always wanted to meet the great Rebecca Sherman.
Tried to get her to speak at a company event for years.
The meeting starts at 4:00, which means we have to leave now.
All right.

Not him.
What?
Okay, so, what do you propose that I do?
Stay back here in the bunker while you all go off and play "Say Yes to the Dress"?
No.

I can get us out of that house in six different ways.
Tell Nimah or Ryan.
Oh, Clay, what do you need me to do, kiss the ring?
- Stop it.

You can wait your turn.
Now, why don't you guys go ahead?

"This"?

Is that what I am now... "this"?
Okay, I don't know what you are, drunk maybe?
No.

Do you know what, guys?

And to be honest, I don't think many of you like it, either.
But I will tell you something.
If you leave without me,
I will not be here when you come back.
Harry.
Thank you.
The wedding is not a problem.
I must admit, I was a little surprised not to be asked to serve on the board of your Ranker.
Oh, it's called The Roster.
I'm sorry.

The Roster, it's very tech-centered, and, well, you're famous for...
Hating the Internet.

I like people.
I like seeing the way a room changes when someone new walks in.
I like seeing people connect who never knew they had so much in common.
So do I.
That...

To create a community of women.
We just use the Internet to do it.
I think as long as you don't send out your wedding invitations via Paperless Post, we'll be fine.
Well, yes.
- I think that we are all agreed on that.

Oh, um, if you don't mind,
I would like, uh, to check in with my mother.
- Of course.

She had the person that she wanted, but we like to do things our own way.
Yeah.
Uh, Max, why don't you ask Rebecca about the last weddings that she's done?
Oh, the upstairs gallery is lined with personal photographs from previous events that I've done,
- so let me show you, Maxine.

Ms. Sherman, um, in the interest of both your time and the First Family's safety,
I'd like to address some logistics before you start, if you don't mind.
Call me Rebecca, please.

I've been through this a hundred times.
You go on up.

Excuse me.
Hey.
Our date's tomorrow, isn't it?
Yeah.
- Well, thank you.

Mmm.

I pay attention.
You need a favor.
- You're good.

You ever think about government work?
I have a feeling I'm about to do some for you.
So your last event with the Secret Service was two years ago?
How does one of America's heroes wind up doing protective detail for the First Family?
I decided to pursue a life that was a little less, um, involved.
Aren't you bored?
That wasn't a real question.

I can tell.
I speak eight languages, three of them well, and number one is body language.
You have to be able to tell from across the room if it's working, and you are not comfortable here.
Yes.

I have parties with people like you.
There's aren't many like you, that's for sure.
But when I come upon one, I never know where to put them.
No matter who I sit next to them, it's never a good fit.
Because you're not one thing.
You're not someone who can be placed.
You're not a part of all this.
You're always outside it, above it.
Hey, you passed the gallery.
Where are you going?
I told you to stay with Rebecca.
Your new secret job?

Do not treat me like I'm stupid, Clayton.
Just hold on for four minutes, okay?
And I don't mean "above it" in the ego sense of the term.
I mean you see everything.
You can't close your eyes even if you want to.
And neither can I.
That's how I know that you're keeping me here.
With due respect, ma'am, you're the one who's doing the talking.
Listening can be just as active as talking.
- Ms. Sherman, I...

We still have some final details to go over.
_
So, you're a hacker and a liar?
Please.

Just stand guard outside and make sure she doesn't come in here.
_
Oh, mnh-mnh.

You're bossy when you ask for favors.
I know.
Rebecca's one of my favorite people I've profiled.
She has lovely kids.
And to this day, she'll tip me off when she sees something on sale that would look great on me.
You're really not gonna tell me what this is about?
I'm really not.
Then you're gonna owe me a lot more than dinner.
Ms. Sherman.
Rebecca, I love the house.

Mm.
- Excuse me.

I'll go check on Clay.
Ms. Barinov, I'm in the middle of something.
Uh, I'm...

I just wanted to give you a heads-up that one of our journalists is running a piece on Peggy Deagle, and she says you're old friends and mentioned you quite a bit in the piece...
Peggy has been gunning for me for 10 years.
What does she have now?
Mostly things about your family.

Could I...

Like, did you have a pet growing up?
- A dog?

_
I went to Miss Porter's, not Dalton.
She's a moron.

I'm sorry.

_
_
- I'm leaving, Clay.

"The kind of girl"?
And your mother's name was Robin Marks?
No.

Why is she...

I'm sorry.

- Maxine.

Clay.
Uh...
You're still FBI.
- And you're onto me.

Thank God.
Can you help me before they kill me?
Turns out Rebecca isn't the sinister force we thought.
Over the course of her career, she's been doing what she does best...
Bringing people together.
Unfortunately, along the way, she helped facilitate connections that led to the formation of our collaborators.
Why didn't she stop once she realized what she'd done?
Because she has a husband and two kids.
And that adds up as leverage for the collaborators.
She was being blackmailed this whole time.
After the G20, she started looking for a way to get out, and that's why she accessed the cache.
She was trying to hack into U.S. passport control, looking for a means to disappear with her family undetected.
And we're gonna help her do exactly that.
In exchange for safe passage, Rebecca's gonna provide us with the identities of the collaborators and the information and the evidence we need to bring them to justice.
But she only knows one for sure outside of Roarke.
Anyone ever heard of Thomas Roth?
Big-league attorney in New York.
D.C. politicos call him the "101st senator."
Right.

He operates in the corridors of power to write and shape the laws that allow them to build their long-term agenda.
This guy must be stopped.
Rebecca lied her way into an urgent meeting.
And like every good lie, it carried a hint of the truth.
She told him that she was compromised.
So he agreed to a meeting tomorrow morning in Central Park.
Okay, we'll have her on comms, and she'll get Roth talking.
Once we get what we need on him, we'll get Rebecca and her family out of the country.
- Understood?

All right.

If you're nervous, don't be.

You're not alone.
I thought I would be scared, but now that I'm here, I feel ready.
The shadow these people have cast over my life this past year, you have no idea what it's done to me, my marriage, my relationship with my children.
I'm afraid to see them, afraid to even call them for fear of putting them in jeopardy.
But when this is done, after you've helped Stewart and me find safe passage, even if it means spending the rest of our days in Greenland,
I'll be able to breathe again.
But you'll have to give it all up.
I mean, the career you've worked so hard for.
My career will outlive me at this point.
That's the thing about women like us, Alex...
Our achievements will always be bigger than we are.
Well, those achievements don't really leave too much room for anything else.
Or, at least that's how I like to explain my love life.
A woman bright, brave, and selfless enough... to save our country from crisis not only once, but twice?
That woman doesn't belong to any man or agency or bureau.
She belongs to history.
What if my place in history costs me... everyone that I love along the way?
You have to choose.
Do you need them more than the world needs you?
We're up.

I always know what to say.
Wyatt in position.
Any word from the reporter on who talked?
No.

According to my experience,
Russian women stand their ground with the best of them.
Why did this one help you with our mission?
Well, I can be very persuasive when I need to be.
Or she owed you a favor.
Did you leak information to her?
Amin is in position.
Booth is moving.
All in position.
We're ready, Clay.
Rebecca, you're a go.
Harry.

- What, you thought I'd left?

No, no, no.

I got my... got my ducks in order, whatever that means.
So I could be fully present without resentment or ego.
- How'd you find us?

Plus I...

I-I figured if I just showed up, you'd have to put me into play.
I have nothing in my life, so it's either this or private security.
And you know what?

And you're still giving me a chance to do that.
So, if you'll take me back, even with the occasional outburst...
We could use you to cover east of the fountain.
Yeah?

Magic.
I have eyes on Roth.

Doyle in.
I run the loop through this park a half dozen times a month and never take notice of it.
Stunning, really, if you take the time.
Has someone been looking into us?
You're nervous, Rebecca.

Given the circumstances, you should be, too.
Our involvement has been... acknowledged.
Why don't you start by telling me who... and how you can be so sure?
- I was approached.

Look, I can save us.
We can give them the names of the others and save ourselves.
Ugh!
Where's our signal?
I don't know.
Come on.
We lost communication.
All we have is visual now.
Rebecca, you're putting me in a difficult position.
I mean, this meeting, the fact that someone approached you, what would you do if you were in my shoes?
I would listen.
I think someone got shot!
Aah!
We can't stay here!
Come up the stairs!

Get these comms back online now.
Got it.
Someone tell me what the hell is going on.
Thomas and Rebecca are both down.

I thought I heard them come from behind me.
Negative... it came from the joggers' path in the woods, to the east.
The sniper could be heading west for a quick escape route.
That's where I would exit.
No way of knowing who's right till we find the shooter.
Split up.
Clay, she's still alive.
I'm going in to recover.
No.

Police are even closer.
What?
Hey.

We can get to her.
If she has any chance of surviving...
We can't risk further exposure, especially you.
Alex Parrish spotted at a scene like this?
Alex, we made a mistake.
We cannot afford to make another one right now.
Owen, that goes for you, too.

Alex, he's right.
Owen, we need her comm.

Rebecca?
Rebecca, can you hear me?
Alex, I'm hurt.
I know, and you're gonna be okay.
The ambulance is on its way.

Just hold on.

Focus on breathing.
I'm trying.

You're gonna make it through this, Rebecca.
I know it.

W-Why isn't anyone... helping me?
We have to move, Alex.
Not yet.
They can't find us here.
Rebecca, just listen to me.
Help is almost here.

Tell my family...
I love them.
Rebecca?
Rebecca, can you hear me?
Talk to me!
Sorry.
NYPD.

NYPD is here.
No sign of the gunman.

There's nothing here, either.
I need everyone back here now.
Which way did it come from?
I don't know.
Ugh!
No, I don't...

Where are you coming from?
I don't...

Can you tell me what's happening?
Where's Harry?
Harry, we need to go.

He's offline.
We needed to leave five minutes ago.
He'll have to meet us back at The Farm.
No, wait.

Harry's a trained assassin.

Now what?
There's no contingency for collaborators getting assassinated.
That's a new one on me.
Whoever did this, they they knew we were there.
Maybe the same person that talked to the reporter talked to the collaborators, tipped them off as to what we were doing.
I don't think that's true.
Neither do I.
Will they pull the plug on this operation?
They wouldn't do that.
We just need a new angle, a new plan.
What we need is to admit we screwed up.
We didn't.

Someone else may have been watching Rebecca Sherman or... or Thomas Roth.
If the collaborators are behind it, killing their own so they wouldn't talk, it's unlikely we will hear anything from them again.
And if they weren't behind it, then we're up against something we know nothing about.
Either way, I have to tell Keyes and my mother.
Two people are dead.

My own fiancée won't talk to me.
We were so close.
Now we're nowhere.
Call her first before you do anything else.
She won't speak to me.
Well, I can tell you what she's thinking.
You tricked and betrayed her.
Everything you said was half a truth, which makes it half a lie.
Are you trying to help me or...?
Look, this is what happens.
People don't understand at first, but she knows you.
She knows if you're doing something, it is for a good reason.
She'll find a way to survive it.
I don't want her to survive it.
What I mean is you will find a language, a way to talk about it without really talking about it, until it becomes just another contour of your relationship.
No.

She knows that I lie now.
Maybe she will forgive me, but even if she does, like you just said, she'll say she forgives me, but she will never really trust me again.
I have destroyed the one good thing in my life for this.
For nothing.
The NYPD called Rebecca's husband.
They told him it was an active shooter in Central Park.
I really thought it would take them longer to frame someone.
You know how easy that is.
Who gets a call when I die?
We don't have many connections, people in our lives to grieve over us, and we made that choice.
Doesn't feel like a choice.
Well, it's because you've made it time and again.
It's who you are.
You're the woman who shot your father to save your mother.
You're the woman who chased a terrorist to stop a nuclear bomb.
You're the woman who raced into a crisis instead of away from it.
You're not the person to hide from anything, and you never will be.
What about you?
Are you hiding?
Looks like you have a choice to make.
What she is...
What she is is your daughter, Owen, and that's never gonna change.
You're still connected.
What you do with that is up to you.
We are where we are now because of her.
So tell her that.
Tell her how disappointed you are in her.
Tell her how you wish things were different.
But you can't cut her out of your life because she's not the person that you want her to be.
You told that reporter about Sean Gregory.
Yes.
Why?
Because she put together who I was, followed me to Brookwell.
So you gave her an exclusive.
And, in exchange, she helped you with Rebecca Sherman.
Well, she is beautiful.
She's all right.
No, don't tell me that you compromised yourself for someone who's just "all right."
Okay.
- She's beautiful.

But that's not why I did it.

Well, you exposed yourself, and now, you should leave the team.
Yeah, I should.
Yet I don't want you to.
You don't?
No.

You're my friend, yet you make the worst decisions when it comes to women.
I could blame you for this, but I make bad decisions, as well, so...
So what should I do?
Find something on her, this woman.
Compromise her, and you are no longer compromised.
Nothing is easy, is it?
I don't know.
Sometimes I think it's easier.
We can't have real connections, so we're free of the mess that comes with them.
What do I know?
The only real connection I have is with my sister.
Well, the only real connection I have is with Alex.
And neither of them wants us.
- Sorry.

Come on.
If we're not going to be able to have real connections, we might as well have fun while not trying to.
Go.

I am going to drink until I forget we had that conversation, and you are going to get yourself out of this mess so we can stop making mistakes.
Hey.
Call your sister.
One day, she'll answer.
The dead father-in-law and brother-in-law's ex in my house.
That's about where I thought this day would end.
Clay's not home.
Unless you've come to tell me that he's left me for you, too.
No.

Oh.

He doesn't know I'm here.
Oh.

Your fiancé is a great person.
I used to think so.
No.

His father and brother, not so sure.
His mother?

But Clay?

He's the one that they got right.
Okay, so you've come all this way to tell me to trust him and accept him and this double life.
I know what it's like when the people you care about lie to you.
I found out a couple years ago that my parents had been lying to me, exploiting my love for them, using my loneliness as a weapon.
That was a real betrayal.
That's not what Clay's doing.
It's not who he is.
Well, I fell in love with an honest man.
Yeah, he is still that man.
The guilt of him not being able to tell you what he's doing is killing him.
All of us working together, we are single without exception, and there is a reason for that.
It's easier to have no connections than to explain away secrets to the people that you love.
But Clay is different.
He doesn't want to live like that.
Don't let him.
I don't understand.
Keep doing exactly what you're doing.
Push back when we pull him away.

Keep him in his guilt.
That is the only way to make sure he'll come back from this job as the man you know.
Don't let him change into one of us... because that's not something he'll come back from.
You are making that up.
Hand to God.

Oh!

Do you know everything about me?
Because it could make for a very boring date if I can't even tell a story.
I did my research.

Well, I don't know anything.
What would you like to know?
Oh.

Why'd you leave Russia?
This isn't first-date material.
It's not our first date.
We were supposed to go to the worst restaurant in town, remember?
Yeah, I think this qualifies.
Yeah.
I was a kid when communism fell.
And we're supposed to live in a new era, a time when government was for the people by the people.
That sounds familiar.
The government wants to control the people of Russia.
They call it democracy, but it isn't real.
Money is real.
Power is real.
Oppression is real.
And the only way to fight those is with the truth.
I couldn't tell the truth, so...
I left.
Do you miss it?
When you leave your... your home, you can never be sure if what you miss is what it was or what you wanted it to be.
My memory is forever changed being outside of it.
I know exactly what you mean.
Hey.

Yeah, we were just going over all the guest lists Rebecca gave us from her events.
Trying to see if we can figure out the connection, but I can't find anything.
Same here.
Hey, listen.

I was wrong about Samar.
No, you were right.

No.
This life that we live, this work that we do, it's all so lonely.
She may not be your real sister, but if she feels like family, you can't ignore that.
Call her.
And what about you, Nimah?

She doesn't answer my calls.
Well, the Nimah that we know... wouldn't wait for the phone to ring.
She is right.
When is she not right?
You gonna be okay here by yourself?
Yeah.

- All right.

Bye.
Good night.
Finally, after days at a time away, my fiancé is back.
I hate lying to you.
That's why I'm marrying you.
Dad.
Hey.
Shelby.
It's good to see you.
Mm.
I could get into so much trouble for that.
Yeah, it's probably not a good thing to do your first day on a new job.
Oh, no, probably not.
Well, look at that.
It's 1:00 a.m. I'm done.
Well, where are you headed to next?
I know a terrible bar that's still open.
Oh, lead the way.
Let me tell the editor on duty.
Harry, what happened?
I'm starting to get worried about you.
Well, don't.

After what happened today, Alex, I-I can't.
- I understand.

I'm sorry.
I thought you might want to be a part of something... with me.
Yeah.

Goodbye.
Goodbye, Harry.

Take care of yourself, okay?
