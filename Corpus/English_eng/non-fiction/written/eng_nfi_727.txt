Previously, on "The Flash"...
Four years from now,
Dr. Brand invents the technology that traps Savitar in the Speed Force.
This is the Speed Force bazooka.
And that's gonna trap Savitar?
I know what you are.
You're a time remnant.
You all shunned me... because I wasn't the true Barry Allen.
I was an aberration.
How did you become Savitar?
I was broken and alone.
God feels no pain.
All I had to do was become one.

In order to turn it on, we need something to power it.

I really don't think you should be spying on me, Cisco.
