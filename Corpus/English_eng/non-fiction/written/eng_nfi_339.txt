We don't know anything about him.
He's CA.
I need to know who or what that is.
It's a power not to be messed with, boy.
Anyone who's caught in its blast can no longer move on through this life.
No, I'm pregnant!
My child's a hairy!

You lied to me all my life.

What are you doing?

I can walk.

I'll walk.
I've never seen one like this before.
No.
But I'm sure it's not a random attack.
No police.
Of course.
Whatever happens, she mustn't be taken to a hospital, subjected to a barrage of tests.
I understand.
Street surveillance cameras would have found them.
Won't take me long to track them down.
And get that footage off the CA system.
We don't want them anywhere near this.
Consider it done.
I'm pregnant!

I'm worried about my baby.
Do you speak English?

Please, please let me go.
I don't understand.

Perhaps I can help.

I wish your people no harm.
Please don't go!
Don't leave me here with him!
Oh, God...
In other headline news today, the search continues for the subhumans that escaped the Containment Authority's prison convoy.
Numbers at the Inclusion Clinic, led by the Department of Human Safety's newly appointed Waruu West, are lower than expected.
In...
Have you got a minute?
How can I help?
Anything you'd like to report?
The other creature.
The thing with the blue light.
You were going to investigate, get back to me.
He, um, didn't kill any of those men, did he?
No, they appear to have been... stunned only.
Are you suggesting it's not dangerous?
Not at all.
I'm just gathering as much information as I can.
But you can't tell me what it is?
What it wants?

Trust me, Minister, I will find a way to stop him.
Let me know if there's any developments.
♪
Been worried about you.
Waruu tried to kill me.
That prick's trying to wipe us off the face of the earth.
He's pumping Hairies full of chemicals.
Makes them lose their hair, their strength.
All you gotta do is volunteer, play nice.
Eventually no CA, no containment, no DNA testing.
- He can't do that.

Well, then, we need to stop him.
Its scales would shimmer under the water like jewels.
And that fish, it was so big...
So big that whenever it moved its fin, huge waves would crash against the shore.
You telling her lies, too?
We'll finish it later.
Don't do this here.
You killed my parents.
Stoned off your head, driving a car with your own son in the back.
What kind of person...
Mother does that?
Did you plan it?
Huh?
Deliberately set the whole thing up?
Answer me.
Koen...
I'm so sorry.
That's it?
Sorry?
- What the hell was that?

Just listen to me.
Koen, listen.
She's sick.
Uncle Jimmy!
Unc?

Uncle?

Uncle Jimmy!
How many more people know about the accident?
Huh?
You knew.
Waruu knew.
So, is it everybody except me?
You all lied to me my whole life.
I grew up in bullshit!

Tell me you found her.
Cameras tracked them all the way through the city, but then we lost them after they left Sector 534.
Lost them?
They've travelled west out of the city some hours ago.
No cameras.
Moving surprisingly fast.
Highway patrols?
They weren't using roads.
But she's still alive.
West could mean mountains.
What can you show me?
How do I find her in there?
You'd need an army.
No one's seen Latani?
No.
Maybe she found a way out.
We need to believe that.
After Djukara... our boy...
I have to go.
Boondee...
I understand why you gave up hope, came here.
No.

I never would have chosen this.

- Waruu.

- A word?

Uh, the polling results are in.
We've dropped several points on the rolling average.
Granted, there's a drop in confidence across the board, but responses to your specific appointment and performance, well...

You're not invoking faith in the electorate.
They see you as an ineffectual poster boy.
It takes time.
As a black man, I'll always be seen as a poster boy.
Opinion will change once we start getting results through.
We don't have time.
You need to change people's perception of you.
Convince me to trust you.
If you have seen these subhumans or Hairy sympathizers, contact your local CA branch immediately.

Hey.

The old bastard showed you the accident, didn't he?
You have every reason to hate me.
Yeah, I do.
He showed me something else, too.
What's that?
Muya.
Anyone that gets caught in the blue blast, their muya gets trapped.
Anyone?
Yeah, anyone.

Yep.

You are in no position to negotiate.

Listen, sunshine.
Take the deal, or I'll report you.
Your call.
Wise man.

Mom!
Where are they taking them?

Processing, all right?

- You can't separate us!

Alinta!

I am so sorry, Jarrod.
This is... this is terrible.
It's an outrage.

Have you heard anything from them, any sort of demands?
Nothing.
Well, the Containment Authority should handle this.
We really don't need news of it getting out.
This footage has already been edited into a package for broadcast.
Look, I understand this is your wife, but this is also a terrorism issue, national security.
On that basis, it'd be a criminal offense, indeed treason, for you to disseminate the footage.
Wouldn't you say the public has a right to know the serious danger it faces?
I would say the public has a need to feel assured they are safe and protected from terrorism by the government.
But they're not.
Do not broadcast that footage.
The last sighting of that Hairy and my wife was in Sector 532, which would suggest they're headed for the mountains.
How do you know which sector?
I want full clearance for Steve Mclntyre.
You're blackmailing me.
I'd like to think of it more as a strategic alliance.
The government and Slade Industries have worked together before.
- We can do it again.

Well, perhaps this might persuade you that we all want the same thing, Minister.
That's from one of your CA surveillance cameras.
But this is classified information.
A vigilante with some sort of super power roaming the streets.
A new kind of Hairy.
The government hushes it up.
Give full access to Steve Mclntyre.
And I want whoever gave that footage to Slade, and I don't care what rules you have to bend or break.
Waruu West.
He's the first place you should look.
- How you doing?

My partner, he dropped off two young females for processing...

Yeah, female human, yes, but she was processed alone.
There's no Hairy prisoner recorded.
Okay, um, no worries.

Can I have a quick word with the young girl?
I've gotta follow something up.
Sorry.

I'd say she won't be going anywhere tonight.
Right.
Give me a call when she's done?
- Dolan, 249.

Uncle Jimmy... did he mention a way to get my muya back?
I think the muya can only be re-entered if someone's dead.
I have to wait.
You should kill me.
I don't know if I can bring you back.
Well, why would you want to after what I did?
That's not it.
- Something's broken.

I can't heal right anymore.
This is Waruu, isn't it?
I messed both you boys up.
I thought cancer was my punishment, but I should've realized it was bigger than that.
I'm condemned to live alone.
For eternity.

I don't expect anything from you.
Things are as they should be.
I guess we've got nothing to lose if we give it a try, then.

Good.
Well, we're gonna have a little fun, then.

You should have told me you had this.
Of course, without the Cleverman, it's just a stick.
All this is useless.
It has a pulse.
One drop of Koen's blood activated it.
Now nothing can damage it.
Nothing.

Once plant material and now, through petrification, stone.
It's amazing.

That so?
How strange.
Waruu West.
Don't do anything until I get there.
Gotta go.

I'll bring it back.
You'll lose valuable time.
Turn it back into its original form.
It'll be my pleasure.

Alinta West was found in the company of a Hairy.

Your daughter's details are not in the system.

Then how do you know the girl you have is my daughter?
She told us.

If you've hurt her in any way...
She's unharmed.

And all of her details now, including her crime,

Release her to me under house arrest.
Put a security tag on her.

Thank God you're all right.
How stupid are you?
Nice to see you, too, Dad.
Does your mother know what you've been up to?
Where is she?
I don't know.

Mustn't have been easy, what you did.

No, not that bit.

Why'd you do it?
I was crazy with grief.
Jealousy.
I loved your father.
Too much.
I just drove straight at them.

I pulled her from the wreckage.
There was so much blood.
And you were coming.
I could see that.
Weren't nothing gonna stop you popping out right there in the glass and blood and metal.
I didn't have to do much.

I brought all this on.
I guess we're even, then.
Ah.

We gotta get you out of them clothes.
You're a leader, boy.
You gotta start looking like one.
Like Uncle Jimmy.
Mad hair and no shoes.
