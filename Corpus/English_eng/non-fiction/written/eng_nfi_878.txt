Previously on AMC's "The Son"...
That's Pedro García's son-in-law!
Who blew up my rig?
What am I supposed to do with him now?
I'm sure you're gonna do the right thing.
You can't ever show your face around here again.
I was trying to save you.
Rápido!
Eat your plum, Eli.
Sometimes it's better to get bitten than to starve.
_
_
Tell me more about our rich jackass.
- Billy Philpott.

He's got his fingers in every oil company in the state.
Sun, Gulf, Magnolia, Humble.
- What's his daddy do?

I hate lawyers.

I hate losing the ranch even more.
Don't look at me like that.
You want to take over the books, you just let me know.
I spend all day fighting off people trying to collect money we don't have.
So you need to go in there and sweet talk Mr. Philpott like he's a piece of tenderloin you're trying to climb on top of.
Mm-hmm.

Fancies himself a renegade.
Renegade, huh?
What does that mean?

- Daddy..

Attaboy, get it all out.
- Goddamn it.

- Phineas.

And you must be Colonel McCullough.
- Fred Bernhauer.

You don't have to call me Colonel until you piss me off.
Mr. Philpott can't wait to meet you.

Well, the pleasure's all mine.

You should be more careful, son.
Now your average Comanche...
He had a mind like an encyclopedia.
He could tell you the name of every plant in the Southwest, along with its various efficacies.
He could look at the track of an animal and know everything about him.
Young, old, fat, skinny.
Hell, he could look at your track and tell if you've had cancer.
Well, you know, uh, the dark races have always been gifted that way.
Hell, I got a Mexican, has a nose for quail you would not believe.
I can only imagine.
So, what do you think, Fred?
Did you ever dream that you'd be breaking bread with the First Son of Texas?
- It is a privilege.

Oh, Mr. Philpott, you should show him the...
No, no, no, Fred.
I'm sure the Colonel doesn't want to see that.
Well, now you got us curious.
Yeah, let's have it now, Billy.
- Well, I'll tell you, if you insist.

All right, here it is.
I was told that Quanah Parker himself shot this into some poor settler.
Poor man's widow pulled it right out of him.
Now generally speaking, the Comanche use steel arrowheads.
Old Quanah himself, he favored Colts and Winchesters.
Well, I-I-I have it from a good source.
Oh, I don't doubt it.
It certainly is unusual.
It was the first obsidian arrowhead
I've ever seen in these parts.
Might be worth something, Billy.
Hell, Colonel, you don't have to kiss my ass.
I, uh, I'm man enough to admit when I've been hustled.
Shall we get down to business?
Now that you got us all lubricated.
All right, let's have at it.
Well, now... while I admire your personal achievements, Colonel,
I did some sniffing around myself before our meeting today.
And I must tell you,
I do not admire the state of your finances.

In fact, I hear that you all lost a drilling rig to a greaser attack just the other day.
Not to mention the fact that it doesn't appear that south Texas has much by way of oil.
Now, if your ranch was on the coastal plane, now, that'd be different.
Well, our neck of the woods is virgin potential, Billy.
I wager if someone's gonna buy into that valley, they're gonna make a lot of money, and I'd like it to be you and me.
Well, now, Colonel, you can't eat a wager.
I'm real sorry, but only a fool would sink money into the Rio Grande Valley right now.
I've heard you're a bit of a renegade, Billy.
Is that true?

Not when it comes to losing money, I ain't.
Like I said, sorry.
Mr. Philpott, I'm a little confused here.
If you knew in advance you weren't interested, then why did you agree to the meeting?
We drove 10 hours to get up here.
Well, heck,
I just wanted to meet the Colonel.
What the...

Daddy, no!

_
_
Let me buy you two lunch.
Prime rib is a specialty of the house, which I recommend served rare.
And I hope you brought your appetite, because you are not gonna wanna miss that pecan pie.
Jeannie?
I've been looking for you everywhere.
I've been here.
Come on.
What happens when someone dies?
What?
What happens when someone dies?
If they're good, they go to Heaven.
Who knows if they're good?
God does.

Are we good?
Of course we are.
We're McCulloughs.
Let's go.

What are you reading?
Oh, that's a good one.
Thanks.
Can we talk?
Okay, sure.
Should we... walk somewhere?
Okay.
What's on your mind?
My brother-in-law went missing.
Cesar.
I remember him.
He went out the night of your father's birthday party and never came home.
I'm very sorry.
My sister is a wreck.
If something bad did happen, she needs to mourn properly and move on.
So you haven't heard anything?
- No.

I don't think much happens around here without your family knowing about it.
That night, we were all pretty occupied tending with the damage to our rig, and all.
Well...
I thought at least I would ask.
- If you hear anything...

I know you don't want to hear this...
I'm not selling land to the goddamned Midkiffs.
- It's just eight sections.

Well, then the bank forecloses on the ranch.
If someone sets foot on my property,
I'm gonna blow their freakin' heads right off.
They're not gonna need to set foot on the property.
They'll just take it in the courts.
- See you later.

I got somewhere to be!
- You want me to drive you?

Hey, I'm sorry.
I had no idea Philpott was gonna do that.
We'll find another investor.
Want to get a drink?
Someplace private?
Sounds good.
Hup, hup!
Hup!
Come on!
Yah!

Papá!

- ¿Dónde está Papá?

Papá!
Señor Pizaña.
Aniceto Pizaña?
A friend of Cesar's.
Señor Pizaña!

Ana.

And you must be Maria.
You have your mother's eyes.
Thank you, Señor.
Aniceto.
It's nice to see you safe.
Ignacio, see to s horses
- and leave his men something to eat.

Señor Pizaña, have you seen Cesar?
- He's been missing for days.

Give the man some breathing room.
He's come a long way.
Why don't we talk in my office?
Ladies.

You save any turtle for me, fat boy?
Come on.
_
This is Escute.
You probably seen him around.
He's gonna show you some of our ways.
The warrior's called Wohonuu makwiyetu.
English, "Charges the Enemy."
Probably seen him, too.
Can I try that?
Don't talk so much.

Aah!

Ah!

I don't remember inviting you.
You want me to leave?
How's old Tom?

My husband works every day.
He's not a rich old kaheeka like you.
_
You're not as old as you look.
Hey.
Hey.
Come here.
Come here.
Are you all right?
It seems we haven't talked in a while.
I'm fine.
Well, I'm not.
The kids...
Hush.
I need a talking-to.
Can I ask you a question?
Okay.
Is there something going on?
Something that I don't know about?
N-not that I can think of.
I saw what I could have sworn was blood out in the old blacksmith's shed.
So?
That seems a strange place for butchering'.
What were you doing in there?
Following Jeannie.
She was lurking around the way she does and asking strange questions.
Pete.
Hey.

Stop it.

You start talking about blood and butchering.
Who wants to hear that?

What aren't you telling me?
You're gettin' started early.
Sit down, Tom.
How many you think we got buried out there?
I don't know.
Don't wanna know.
So how many you got?
Fewer than the Colonel.
How many he got?
I doubt he even knows.
Let me ask you, Pete.
What's your number?
Two I'm sure of.
Not to mention all the stuff he brought me along for.
You ever put a slug in a man who wasn't hurting you?
No.
Then by the likes of someone like me, you've had it pretty easy.
You ever think about the families of the men you put down?
No.
We're born into a certain time and place, and there ain't nothing we can do about it.
I think we all got a choice, Tom.
Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?
- Pete.

No, Sully.
Come on, Pete.
Look, if you want to drive somewhere,
I'd be happy...

_
- What's the point of this lesson?

Stand here while they shoot at you.
Training arrows, no spikes.
Isn't likely they'll kill you.
- So you want me to stand here?

Try and use the shield.
Where are you going?
I don't want to get shot.
Watch the arrows!

Good.

That arrow had a broadhead in it!
_
Aah!
_
I'm gonna kill him.
Nah, you were 100 paces away.

Stupid to go after him.
He shot a broadhead at me.
- You expect me just to forget about that?

What about honor?
Attacking a man you cannot defeat comes from pride, not honor.
Pride is often the opposite of honor.
You're not a Comanche yet.
One day you might be, but for now, you're my property.
You're no different from one of my horses.
If someone hurts you, you're not allowed to fight back.
It's my job to protect you.
You understand?
When will I be a Comanche?
Did you receive satisfaction?
Since when do you care?
Mm.
- Mmm, this is nice.

Slow down.

That's whal'm hoping for.
Mm.
So what's the trouble this time?
What makes you think that I have trouble?
Because you're here.
I might have to sell the ranch.
So move somewhere else.
There's nowhere to go.
Used to be, just got on your horse and rode on.
Now there's nothing but people everywhere you go.
I remember the past less fondly.
I feel like I'm getting old.
You've been old for a long time.
I mean in my head.
This...
I don't care about.
My boys want me to sell off part of the ranch, but I got a bad feeling about that.
Once you slice one little piece off, then it's another piece and another piece until there's nothing left.
Are you talking about the ranch or your pride?
Oh, hell, Ingrid.
Sulking doesn't look good on you, so come on out with it.
You're very old, and your children don't appreciate you.
Hmm.
When you're gone... you ever wonder what you'll leave behind?
Dust.
I ain't got much else.
I've been a lot of bad things in my time.
Accrued my fair number of black marks against my soul.
What was it all for?
You know...
I remember when everything you owned would fit in your pocket.
Hmm.
You were happy.
Are you hungry?
No.
You look hungry.
I'm okay.
Hmm.
Oh!

You gettin' up?
You ever think about us?
- Every day.

Yes.
I wish I could live your life, just for a day or two.
Oh!
It's that bad, huh?
Everyone lives in cages.
And you?
Especially me.
So we were the last of the free?
Yep.
It was over after Palo Duro.
An entire empire starved, sickened... and beaten.
Consigned to dust.
You have your time, it passes.
Something new gets built.
Yeah, well, there was a time, I thought I'd live forever.
Lately, I been wondering what's gonna happen after I'm gone.
Ahh.
This isn't about your family.
You want to be remembered.
Of course I do.
Look at you.
You gave up everything to protect your tribe, but you died an early age, and now you're forgotten.
But you remembered me.
That's something.
People can tell stories and sing songs about your many victories.
Won't make your children any happier.
Other things carry more value.
Hey.
Some cold fried chicken for you there.
Obliged.
Used to be, I'd see you more than once or twice a year.
Well, I can make an effort.
You won't.
I got a family.
Speaking of which...
Old Tom will be home around sundown.
I'll eat faster.
Are you happy?
Take care of yourself.
ándale.
Vamos.

Whatever happens, whatever he does, it'll be because of us.

_

Ahh.
Where were you all day?
Busy.
You know I worry, don't you?
Well, you can stop worrying.
Call Midkiff.
See what you can get for those eight sections.
You won't regret this, Daddy.
I already do.
Stay here.
I'm gonna make it right, Sally.
- Hey.

Oh, jeez.

Honey, no, no, no, no.

Pete.

Honey, honey.

- I...

We're gonna get you home.
We're gonna figure this out in the mornin'.
Hey.

- I love you.

- I'm sorry.

Honey.
I know.
Reckon I better move that body.
