ROCKET:

And here we are on yet another krutackin' desert planet!
Quill, how come we never wind up on lush tropical resorts, where they serve ya, you know, those little fruit drinks with the paper umbrellas, huh?
Come on, Rocket.
Just be glad that searching Yondu's hideouts finally paid off.
There's his space pod!
GAMORA:

- I have a bad feeling about this.

Nobody's allowed to have bad feelings or be too old for this, and definitely, nobody says, "Things can't get any worse."
Even though that's a Ravager ship, and they want to blow us up.
All right, look.

NEBULA:

They didn't mention I'd get to destroy my sister as well.
Nebula.
So what?
Without all her cyborg stuff, Quill could take her down.
(LAUGHS)
Wait.
Never underestimate a daughter of Thanos.
Especially when she's in battle armor.
Uh...
When did Nebula get an upgrade?
Maybe you should ask her.

Load the sarcophagus onto the ship.

(YELLS AND GRUNTS)
Anybody else got a plan?
That sarcophagus belonged to Thanos.
By all rights, it's mine!
When she gets close enough, I'm gonna open the sarcophagus.
Boom!

No.

(EXPLOSION)
Watch me.
You want this so bad?

Huh?

D'oh!
(WHIRRING)
(DISGUSTED LAUGH)
(YELLS)
- Oh!

If Thanos hid these artifacts, they must be incredibly dangerous.
Yeah?

(GRUNTING) Quit it!

You don't even know what they do.
Whatever they do, they can't make things any...
Oh.

(GRUNTS)
Well, guess it's up to us...

I am Groot!
That the best you got, furless?
NEBULA:

(GRUNTING)
(GRUNTING)
NEBULA:

Ha!

(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
Sorry, Nebs.

No!
(YELLING)
Come on.

(GRUNTING)
You are freakishly strong.
(GRUNTING) (YELLS AND GRUNTS)
(WHIRRING)
(GRUNTS)
(YELLING)
(PANTING)
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTS)
Oh, sister, you are making this way too easy.
All right.

(WHIRRING) (GRUNTS)
(EXCLAIMING)
Huh?
(EXCLAIMING CONTINUES)
Huh?
(SCREAMING)
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)
(GRUNTS AND YELLS)
(ALL GRUNT)
Oh, this can't be good.
NEBULA:

That helmet is meant for a true daughter of Thanos!
(YELLS)
I can't touch the helmet, but she gets to fly around and shoot lasers out of her hands?
Something's wrong, Quill.

(GASPS)
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTS)
(ALARM BLARING) (BOTH GRUNT)
(YELLS)
(YELLS)
Huh?
(GRUNTS)
(BOTH EXCLAIM)
Gamora, stop!
A minute ago, you were trying to save your sister's life.
Now you're gonna tear her apart?
I've seen this kind of rage before.
Flarg, I've lived this kind of rage before.
(GRUNTS AND YELLS)
(GRUNTS)
Oh.
You are not free to go.
Gamora...
I'm not taking off the helmet.
Look, I get it.

Not power.

What kind of information?

Something else was inside the sarcophagus.
The thing that vaporized the High Evolutionary.

(GASPS)
Whatever it is, it's long gone now.
(GRUNTS)
The Ravagers said Yondu was selling the sarcophagus to the Believers.
Obviously, they got here first, took what they wanted, and left.
Too slow, as always, dear sister.
I don't know if it's the helmet, but something wants me to find that cocoon.
To protect it.
We can't leave that kind to of power in the hands of crazed fanatics.
Says the lady taking orders from a magic hat.
- I am Groot!

You gotta get rid of that krutackin' helmet before it turns your brains to applesauce!
There's a difference between crazy prophecies and actual visions.
My visions led us to the Cosmic Seed, remember?
Yeah, after they led us around in circles for six months.
If your father, Thanos, prized the helmet so, then nothing good can come of it.

If you ask me, that artifact has already warped my sister's mind.
But then again, a daughter of Thanos will do anything for power.
(GROANS)
Not this one.
But that still doesn't change the fact that we need to get the cocoon away from the Believers.
- Why are we bringing her along?

"Keep your enemies closer," as some guy said one time.
That guy was me, just a minute ago.
Besides, there's gotta be a bounty on her somewhere.
Make sure she don't try nothing.
I am Groot.
PETER:

Where are we going?
All I got was a flood of images and sensations.
It's not like the helmet drew me a map.
No problem.
Avoiding the Believers is d'ast impossible, but finding them is easy.
Drax?
AROKINE:

ROCKET:

Just one receptionist up front.
Time to work the ol' Star-Lord magic.
Hi.

All righty.

I was kind of hoping you could show me the way.
I am really not supposed to leave the desk, but it is a slow night.
I do not know what they see in him.
Perhaps it is his distinctive odor.
(EXCLAIMS) Nothing about any cocoon in the comm system.
We gotta find an office or something.
I should tell you, I've been hurt before.
I had a hard time learning to trust again.
But thanks to my training here,
I believe I can see people for who they really are.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
(GASPS )
- It's you!

You're one of the Unbelievers who attacked our flagship!
(HISSING)
Okay.

I am Groot.
Nothing in here neither.
Nor here.
(PETER GRUNTING) (RECEPTIONIST YELLING)
Oh, anger issues!
(GRUNTING)
- Quill, what did you do?

Halt, Unbelievers!
"Unbelievers"?

So we got an upgrade.

(WEAPONS WHIRRING)
The difference is Unbelievers are terminated on sight.
I am Groot!
You sure are.

I thought you'd never ask.
(WHIRRING)
(WEAPONS FIRING) Groot, close the door!
Great.

Beats being trapped in a hallway!
Funny how your "friends" didn't put up much of an argument when you said you were staying behind.
(GRUNTING)
They respect my decisions.
And someone had to keep an eye on you.
Or maybe they didn't really want you on the mission.
Maybe they don't trust you.
No matter how much you try to make up for the sins of your past, you'll always be a daughter of Thanos to them.
That cocoon is our rightful inheritance, sister.
Not that you'd know what to do with that kind of power.
Your conscience makes you weak.
(BEEPING) PETER:

Um, you know that super-stealthy recon mission that the Believers were never gonna find out about?
It's not going well.
Ooh, rescue your friends, or keep your sister captive?
(GASPS)
Which one will you choose?
(GRUNTS)
All of the above.
I believe I can access the supply closet.
I am Groot!
Rocket, can you cut through the outer wall or not?
I'm working on it.
Who the heck builds a triple-reinforced day spa?
(GRUNTING)
(GAMORA GRUNTING)
(BLOWS LANDING)
(BELIEVERS GROANING)
Where is the cocoon?
I...

That's all I know.

Gamora!

We can't leave anyone alive to warn the other Believers.
I am Groot!
- Groot!

Aah!
Lady, you just crossed the krutackin' line.
If we're not careful, none of us will make it out of here.
You don't need to do this.

I trust you, G.
But you need to trust me.
Take... the helmet... off.
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
See?

Gamora?

(DOOR OPENS)
What happened?
PETER:

Groot!

He's gonna be okay.

I told you you couldn't handle that kind of power.
- It was an accident.

We have to lock this thing up before it destroys you or destroys one of us.
What about the cocoon?
The plan hasn't changed.

(CHUCKLING)
Weak.
(MECHANICAL HUMMING)
ROCKET:

If you've got a plan, now would be the time to share it.
I figured we'd do what we always do.
Oh, you mean go in clueless and nearly get our tails shot off?
(BEEPING) Uh-oh.

Nova Prime!

We picked up an unusual Nova Force signature on planet Tashlu and traced it back to your ship.
Weird.

How high is the bounty on her now, huh?

Let's cut to the chase, Quill.
You have something extremely dangerous in your possession.
The Nova Centurion helmets were used by an elite squad in the early days of the Corps.
Wow.

We haven't found any helmets like that, but, you know, if we do...
Based on the energy signature, that helmet has been tampered with.
It drains the life energy from the user.
- Uh, how much life energy we talkin'?

ROCKET:

(SHIP CREAKING)
- Quill, what's going...

What is it?

Not exactly.

Our brethren on Tashlu told us you would be coming.
And now, like all Unbelievers, you will be crushed.
(CREAKING)
Hate to say it, but I kind of believe her!
(CREAKING)
PETER:

Before that Belief energy bubble puts the squeeze on us for good!
Diverting all power to main thrusters.
(GRUNTING)
PETER:

There's too much pressure on the hull.

ROCKET:

Drax the Destroyer does not escape.

The flagship is well shielded.
Our weapons are useless.
GAMORA:

The Believers on Tashlu told the flagship we were coming.

Hey, don't look at me.

Must've had a backup or something.
(NEBULA LAUGHING)
You left witnesses alive?
Did you learn nothing from Father?
You have to let me use the helmet.
But it might destroy you.
Or you might destroy us.
DRAX:

I will leap out the airlock and punch my way inside the flagship.
PETER:

DRAX:

ROCKET:

DRAX:

GAMORA:

Yeah, I don't remember you getting a vote.
(LOUD THUD) (GRUNTING)
Okay, I'm trusting you on this.
(GAMORA GRUNTING)
(YELLS)
MANTIS:

We must act while there's still time.
I believe we can open the cocoon!
She did not wait for us.

(YELLS)
- Gamora!

But I must protect the cocoon.
MANTIS:

Divert all Belief energy to the cocoon!
Engines, life support, everything!
I believe we will open the cocoon!
BELIEVERS:

(GRUNTING)
Guys, I think they cut the power!

(BEEPS) Groot, can you hear me, buddy?
The flagship's crashing!

Groot!
The Golden Age is nearly upon us.
No!
Unbelievers!

We ain't got time for this.

I don't think they care.
(GRUNTS)
You are too late, Unbeliever.
I believe nothing can stop the cocoon from opening.
(EXCLAIMS)
(GRUNTING)
GAMORA:

Did you forget about me, sister?
Nebula!
(GRUNTS)
Don't!

(GRUNTING)
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTING)
Gamora!
I knew you didn't have what it takes, sister dear.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Quill, the helmet told me what I have to do.
You must never let the cocoon be opened, ever!
I'm trusting you on this.
- Wait.

(BOTH GRUNTING)
(GRUNTS)
No!

AUTOMATED VOICE:

Quill, we gotta get outta here.
Gamora trusted me.

Hurry, Quill.
Everyone, you must believe.

Yes, my friends, all things are possible if only you believe!
PETER:

I see.

She escaped.

(CREAKING)
What happened to him?
Cooking accident.
I keep telling him to use oven mitts.

Very well.

Eventually.
Why did you not tell Nova Prime about the wristbands or the cocoon?
Because Gamora's still out there somewhere.
And we're gonna get her back.
Where am I?
NEBULA:

(GASPS)
But if the High Evolutionary's here, then it's nowhere good.
