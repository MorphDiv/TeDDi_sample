Previously on "once upon a time"...
The evil queen sent everyone from the enchanted forest here.
That's what you're going with?
It's true.
It's your destiny.
You're gonna bring back the happy endings.
I do hope you like apples.
It's poison.
You may not believe in the curse, but I believe in you.
Henry!
Every story in this book actually happened.
Goodbye, Emma.
Henry, you were right about the curse.
I should've believed you.
I love you, Henry.
This might be the most important mission yet...
Operation best man.
What is it, father?
I'll stay behind, give you time to escape.
You have to make sure it stays safe.
You have it, don't you?
Of course.
It never leaves my side.
Good.
It may be the realm's only hope of defeating the darkness.
I will guard it with my life.
You need to get to safety.
You need to share these stories.
But who will believe them?
Daddy!
I...
Me too.
The black fairy's curse!
It's here!
Where do you think it's taking us?
Doesn't matter.
Wherever we end up, we're gonna win.
What did the black fairy's curse do?
Really, Henry?
Henry, I-i-i thought we were past all this.
She's done something to you, to... to everyone.
Henry, um...
Do I need to schedule another appointment?
Henry...
You know exactly where Emma is.
She's in the same place that she's been for the last two years.
Emma?
You have a visitor.
Your son.
Mom.
Henry.
Thank god you remember me.
Of course I remember you.
Good, 'cause I just looked all over town, and I couldn't find the rest of our family...
Snow, David, hook.
I'm not going down that road again.
I've worked way too hard for you to undo my progress.
Progress?
You know what I mean.
Those people...
Snow white, prince charming, captain hook...
None of them are real.
My parents are not fairy-tale characters.
This is just a regular town.
What happened to me is I'm getting better.
I ended up in this nuthouse because I believed you back then, bought into all of it.
No, this is the black fairy.
She said she would take away your family, and this is how.
I just...
Want to get well so that maybe...
Maybe I can be your mother.
Okay.
How long have you been a patient here?
You know how long I've been here.
Maybe it'll help if you relive it.
Ever since you tried to prove that fairy tales were real by eating a poisoned apple turnover.
You ended up in the hospital for weeks.
You barely made it through.
No, that's not how it happened.
This is crazy.
You're the one who's supposed to be getting better.
Henry, you were not saved by a kiss.
That's ridiculous.
It's time.
Stop it.
It might be how the black fairy is keeping you from remembering.
Henry, just let me...
This page I wrote...
It means that the final battle is coming.
The key to winning it is in here.
But we can't do that until you start believing.
Sorry about him.
You have to stop doing that, or your mother's not gonna let you keep visiting me.
Who's Regina?
Henry.
There's my boy.
Madame mayor, I'm sorry.
I didn't know he was coming today.
How many times have I told you?
It's Fiona.
No need for titles here.
Now, Henry...
Shouldn't you be at school?
Of course.
What's that?
Where did you find that?
Nothing but trouble seems to come from this book.
Now, Henry, back to school.
I'll see you at dinner.
Emma and I have some business to discuss.
Okay, mom.
Whatever she wants you to do, don't do it.
Now then...
I think somebody needs to take their medicine.
Yeah, I'm okay.
No.
She's gone.
She ripped us apart.
What now?
We're in the enchanted forest.
Well, she has panache, I'll give her that.
She took you from your wedding to theirs.
This is where we got married.
Right before we were cursed.
We'll find him.
If she thinks she can rip this family apart...
Curses have never stopped us before.
Today will be no different.
We'll get Emma and Henry back.
Wherever they may be.
All due respect, Emma, but you do seem quite agitated.
Yes, really.
Everything is okay.
Well, I just came to check on your progress.
As mayor of storybrooke, can you blame me for taking a keen interest in all of our residents?
All of your "troubled" residents.
All due respect, Dr. hopper and madame mayor,
I know exactly what this is really about.
Do you now?
Henry.
Yes.
Well, you are his biological mother, and he is my son, so perhaps there is a bit more to my interest.
I don't think that's any secret.
Emma has been doing quite well of late.
Wonderful.
Dr. hopper's reports are very encouraging.
I don't think I'm talking out of school to say you might be eligible for release soon.
Wouldn't it be nice to paint a different view than these dreary, old hospital grounds?
We are working on the landscaping.
Perhaps even the Boston skyline?
As I recall, you had a lovely apartment overlooking it all.
Wouldn't it be nice to go back?
Good.
Because it's not just your well-being that I'm concerned with.
It's Henry's.
He's clearly still clinging to the delusion that these stories are real.
Now, I'd hoped we were past all that.
I never meant to do any harm.
Of course you didn't.
But as luck would have it, his book has given me an idea of how we could cure him of all of this nonsense.
Burn it.
Show him that you've truly embraced reality and then he will.
Because belief in something, something that isn't real, can be dangerous.
No?
Look, I know all these stories are fake, but I can't destroy this.
And yours.
I...
I'm not ready for that.
Really?
You might not be ready now, but you will be.
Of that, I am quite certain.
Dr. hopper will hold onto it until that day comes.
And it will...
Because, miss swan... until you're ready to destroy the book and make a clean break from this fantasy world, you'll remain locked up.
Which she is controlling.
It's the final battle.
Well, clearly, it wasn't what we thought it was.
Clearly.
Of course the final battle isn't a war.
It's a battle for her soul, for her belief, her hope.
I don't get it.
What does she gain if Emma stops believing?
I think I might know.
Zelena.
What is she doing here?
Helping, thank you very much.
The mad hatter's hat.
W-wasn't it destroyed?
Inside are portals to every realm.
I used it to escape oz.
Escape?
Why did you need to escape your own realm?
Look, there isn't much time.
It's easier if I show you.
If you want to know what we were running from...
Take a gander.
There's nothing there.
I can see that.
When I left oz, it was falling apart...
Apocalyptic, but now...
What the bloody hell does this got to do with Emma?
This is what she's doing.
It's why she wants Emma to destroy the book.
As the savior's belief fades... so do all the realms of story.
If we don't stop the black fairy... all the realms will be destroyed... and everyone in them.
Who's here, papa?
Just checking everything is as it should be.
You know what they say...
A mayor's work is never done.
Madame mayor...
An honor.
I brought you lunch, and a little job if you'll take it.
My wristwatch stopped.
Guess I'm not good for timepieces.
We'll figure out that clock tower one day.
Don't worry.
And I'll get working on the watch right away.
Thank you.
Thanks for lunch.
Your favorite oatmeal raisin cookies are in there, too.
Thank you.
You're very kind, always thinking of Gideon.
Well, when someone's lost their mother...
I feel a need to step into that void.
And how are you doing?
I know this time of year can be difficult.
Yes.
It is hard, thinking of belle on our anniversary...
Given what happened.
Yes, it's terribly sad.
So sad.
Thank you.
Well, I'll be back for the watch later.
I always know I can count on you.
And please...
If there's anything I can do.
After all, for my boys...
I'm always here to help.
I saw someone from arendelle just now.
They still had snow on their shoulders.
What?
How far is this nightmare spreading?
Far.
Jasmine, Aladdin?
The black fairy's doing this all the way from storybrooke.
She's attacking Emma's belief.
The more she loses faith, the realms of story fade away.
We need to get back there and stop all this.
What about the portal we just came through, the hat?
It can't make a passage to a land without magic.
We need something else.
I have it.
I mean, I think I have it.
I might have a theory where to look.
Well, all due respect, captain, but what we need right now is magic.
And that's my area.
It's time I get to work and do what I do best.
We need to get out of this hat and back to my castle.
I don't care what kind of magic it takes,
I'm getting Henry and Emma back.
Henry?
Dr. hopper really needs to keep an eye on his wallet.
You don't belong here.
And no matter what the mayor says, she's never letting you out.
But I am.
Welcome to operation cuckoo's nest.
I haven't seen the movie in a long time, but didn't that end with a lobotomy?
Just...
We have to get out of here before the nurse comes back.
Come on!
Bloody hell.
It's taller than I remembered.
Hey!
Next time you sneak off on a secret mission, you might want to make sure there's no munchkins around.
They're easily bought.
Honestly, stealth wasn't a priority...
Speed was.
So this is your theory on how to get home?
Hoping there's a magic bean up there?
There's only one way to find out.
Hook, that beanstalk's over 1,000 feet high.
You really think you can climb that alone?
I think I want to get back to my wife.
But making her a widow is not what I'd call a good plan.
You're gonna get yourself killed.
I'll have you know I've scaled this before.
With Emma.
It was our first adventure together, though my motives were less than chivalrous then.
Yeah, I seem to recall you trying to kill her and snow.
Granted, it was hardly love at first sight.
Emma and I were never a predestined love story, guaranteed a happy ending.
We fought for our love, and we won.
And you...
You of all people should understand that.
But now...
You saw into that mirror.
She doesn't even remember who I am.
So, yes,
I'm gonna climb this beanstalk, and I am gonna find that bean...
Because I'm not gonna lose everything I have just because some bitter fairy cast another bloody curse!
our story began on the beanstalk, and I'll be damned if it ends there, too.
All right.
Just.
Take a deep breath.
All right, calm down.
Let's go get that bean together.
Okay, well, unless we're waiting for a helicopter,
I think we went the wrong way.
We're here because this is the last place you saw your family.
The last place you remembered who you really are...
The savior.
Mom, it's true.
Henry, you have to accept these things are not real.
And bringing me to some rooftop is not gonna convince me that my mother is snow white.
But she is.
And this isn't just some rooftop.
This is where you married your true love yesterday.
That's not the way the world works.
It does, and it did for you.
You married captain hook right here.
The aisle was right here...
Where your parents gave you away.
The only time they gave me away was when I was a baby.
Mom, stop it.
They walked you to the altar.
That's where you exchanged vows, in front of all your friends and family who love you.
I don't know.
Henry, I don't know what I saw.
I've been in a mental hospital for years.
It's not like my brain is really trustworthy right now.
I don't want to fight.
I want to go home to Boston.
Storybrooke is your home.
But, Henry, you're right.
If I stay here, Fiona's just gonna lock me up again.
And that's not good for me or you.
Y-you can't leave.
It's not for forever.
I'll come back, I promise.
But you got to wait.
You'll be safer if you leave after dark.
I know where Dr. hopper keeps your car keys.
A few seconds ago, you were trying to keep me here.
Now you're gonna help me leave?
You're my mom.
I'll always want to help you.
And you're right.
You don't deserve to be locked up again.
Thanks, kid.
Meet me back in an hour, and after that,
I promise you'll have the life you always wanted.
"To my son, Gideon."
Remember to be strong and true.
I will always love you.
"Mother."
Gideon...
I know it's not easy to talk about belle.
But this book...
Meant the world to her, and she really wanted you to have it.
I know.
So I would always remember how much she loved me.
Yeah.
How much do you remember?
A-about when she left?
She said she was going to the store, and she never came back.
Yeah, well, you know, I-i-I've been thinking, and, um...
Well, maybe we don't know the whole story.
Your mother wouldn't just leave... not without good reason.
Will you stop with this?
She walked out on us.
Don't try to rationalize it away.
She didn't love us.
No.
No, I-i-i can't accept that.
She would never do that.
But she did.
And you know what?
We don't need her to have a happy life.
We have everything we need right here in this shop.
You just...
You refuse to see it.
Your mother loved you, Gideon.
And no matter what may have happened between us...
She would always want to be a part of your life.
Please, just... leave it alone.
Gideon.
Lizard horn?
How is that possible?
I had tons of it.
It's all gone.
All my things are gone!
Somebody's stolen from me!
Well, it can't be any of the new people.
Goody.
I think we're about to find out.
I am so going to enjoy this.
Regina?
You're back.
I-I'm back?
You're back.
Well, this is disappointing.
So, you're the one who's been squatting in my castle?
I'm not "squatting" anywhere.
This is the evil queen's castle, after all.
Nice outfit, by the way.
We really do make it look good, don't we?
Thanks.
I-I mean w-what are you doing here?
I thought you were in that wish realm with Robin.
Well, I was.
But there was one little thing you neglected to mention before sending me off to my fabulous new home.
Everyone there thinks I murdered snow and charming.
And my own son was trying to kill me.
So, after three days of angry villagers trying to burn my home,
I decided to find a new place to live.
What about Robin?
Did you murder him, too?
Of course not.
He's out with friar tuck.
And I don't murder anymore, zelena.
Robin and I have turned over a new leaf.
We now steal from the rich and give to the poor.
Well, mostly anyway.
Sounds delightful.
Look, can we get back to saving the world now?
You know, while there's still one to save.
Yes, um...
Do tell.
Yes?
She did what?
Henry.
Hey, mom.
There's no reason to pretend, Henry.
We both know I'm not your mother.
So, you know I'm awake.
I know everything.
What are you gonna do?
Put me in the crazy house, too?
Of course not.
You're much more useful to me out here.
What's that mean... "useful"?
Turns out, getting a savior to give up her belief is much harder than I thought.
Even if you take everything away from her, which I have, there's still that one last pesky speck of belief that just refuses to die out.
And it never will.
My mom's strong.
She'll fight it, and there's nothing you can do to stop that.
You're right.
There is nothing I can do to stop it.
But there is something you can do.
Madame mayor, what happened?
There was an accident.
Henry broke into his doctor's office, had a nasty fall down the stairs.
I'm so sorry.
I just don't know how this could be.
They say that he's stable, but it was such a tumble.
Thank you.
But that's not the only reason for your visit, is it?
I know this is poor timing, but there's something I need to discuss with you.
Yes, the timing is poor.
Perhaps we can chat about it later over my infamous black pudding.
Gideon, too, of course.
I need you to reopen the investigation into belle's disappearance.
You and Gideon lead such charmed lives.
Why tear open old wounds?
Well, they never properly healed.
He needs to know the truth.
Belle wouldn't just abandon him for no reason.
Come with me.
Well, it appears we have some ground to cover.
Well, it's got to be in here somewhere.
Maybe it's up there.
Well, that shouldn't be too difficult.
Apart from the fact that that's way up there, and we're way down here.
What's some oversized furniture?
It's not the furniture I'm worried about.
It's its oversized owners.
I thought the giants were gone.
It appears some have stayed.
Let's not dawdle.
What are we doing?
You can't pull yourself up there.
You don't think I've swung from masts before?
I'm doing this.
She's your daughter, but she's my wife.
Okay, you're right.
I am?
Yeah.
So, you're gonna trust all of our fates to a pirate?
No.
I'm gonna trust my son... in-law.
Thank you.
Is everything all right up there?
This place is a bloody obstacle course.
Merlot.
I think I just might have found something.
What was that?
Just,
Retrieving the.
The bean!
Bloody hell.
I think I just woke up the giants!
Hook, I think it's worse than giants.
Don't tell me you're afraid of a little fire.
That's not fire.
So, yes.
I haven't been completely honest.
The police did find evidence of what happened to belle.
I just wanted to save you and Gideon the heartbreak.
Well...
She wanted to see the world.
Just not with you, it would appear.
Look, I must be frank with you, for your sake as well as Gideon's.
You're the one that caused him all this pain, not belle.
She left because you could never be the man she wanted you to be.
But you can still be the man your son needs you to be...
By accepting that and moving on.
Thank you.
This was...
Illuminating.
Henry.
What do you know?
Henry!
Mom?
He was trying to steal this.
Then he tried to escape and had a nasty fall.
You lied to me.
You said you were done with all this.
She wants to destroy your belief.
He's confused...
Concussed, according to Dr. whale.
Look, I pulled this from the security camera.
Put aside the fact that he's my own son...
How could I push him if I wasn't even touching him?
She used magic.
Kid, there's no such thing as magic.
True belief is believing even if you can't see.
Here, just look at the book.
Henry.
It... it didn't work.
I'm sorry, but you're not a kid anymore.
This isn't some daring rescue operation.
It's real life.
It was just his arm this time.
Next time, what if it's his neck...
Or worse?
This is the apple turnover all over again.
He's hurting himself to make you believe his delusions.
Then you know what you have to do.
Kid, just 'cause you believe something doesn't make it true.
That's exactly what makes it true.
Deep down, you know that.
What I know, Henry, is that I love you.
And that's why I have to do this.
Mom.
Henry, I'm sorry.
Mom!
I don't think so.
I think we got a bigger problem than a dragon!
Go on, dear.
Only you can save our son now, Emma.
Go on.
I think we may be too late.
