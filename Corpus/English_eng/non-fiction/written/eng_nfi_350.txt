50 years have passed.
But I do not age.
Time has lost its effect on me.
Yet the suffering continues.
Aku's grasp chokes the past, present, and future.
Hope is lost.
Got to get back...
Back to the past.
Samurai Jack.

Ohh!
Ugh!
I'm so sorry.

No, I know, not from the thing
- that we did, but...

Mm-hmm.

Oh, right.

Oh!

I still have your robe.
Gi!
You-You should still wear that.
Uh, it's very drafty in here.
I'm gonna find some clothes.
Very well.

Yes.
Well, I better go, 'cause, you know, it's very drafty, and you're not wearing any clothes, either.
Yes.
I'll see you in a bit, then.
Bye.
Bye.
Where am I gonna find some clothes?
Hmm.

Hi.
This all looks quite lovely.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Sh-Should we sit?
Yes.
Oh, and I have food.
So do I.
A little chewy.
Yes.
Oh, but still very good.

Jack, do you ever think about home?
Every day.
My family, my home...

My father was the emperor, so we lived in the palace overlooking the whole village.
It was so high up in the air that it touched the clouds.
I would just stare out at the beauty of the seasons changing.
The summer sun blanketed the valley with long, beautiful shadows.
The fall leaves brought a bounty of color.
Winter was so white.
And the cherry blossoms in the spring.
And... was there a girl?
Yes, many.
Oh!

I...

No, no.
I was only 8 when Aku came and then everything...
Jack, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to...
It is nice to remember the time before Aku.
It is the only way I will ever see it again...
As a memory.

You are now hearing the voice of Aku!
Ah!

I'm sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you.
Now, go!
Oh, no, baby.
I did not come all this way for nothing.
Luckily, Scaramouche knows scarymuch about all the ins and outs, babe.
Aku!
Go away.
Didn't you hear the recording?
Leave me alone!
Oh, but, Aku-kachu, I got some info on Jack-o that's outta this world, babe!
Ugh.
Whaaaat?

Feast your ears on this.
I mean, do you even have ears?
Like, can those antler things even hear?
Get on with it!

Jack... why?
Why did you just leave like that?
You shouldn't have followed me.
You need to go back.
Go back?
No.
I'm not going anywhere.
What's going on?
You don't understand.
So help me understand.
Jack.
All these years,
I have seen so many innocents fall victim to Aku...
Kind and decent people...
My friends, my family...

His evil has taken everything I've ever...

All I have left are memories.
I do not want you to become just a memory.
Jack, don't you see?
Everything that has happened in our lives has brought us here...
Right now, together.
And together, we're going to defeat Aku.
Samurai Jack!
Aku!
Aku?
It has been too long...

But you're probably saying to yourself,
"Why?

Well, a little birdie told me... that Samurai Jack has lost the one thing in the entire universe that can destroy Aku!
You fooooooooooool!
Ugh?

Oh, but, master I...
Well, it has been nice catching up, but I should go.
I don't want to interrupt you and your lady friend.
Pretend I was never here.
I'll let myself out.
Aku!
Wait a minute.
I smell something...

I smell me!
Madness!
Hold it!

Really!
There's more Aku here, besides me.
Stay back!
Yes.
I smell me inside of her.
Ashi.
Jack.
But how can that be?
I never...

There was that one time.

Not bad.

Yes, an attractive replica, but it pales to the original.

Worship me, daughters of Aku!
So she must have... drank it?
And then...
Here you are, a true daughter of Aku.

Yaaaagh!
Aaah!
Ashi?
I-I didn't do this!
Yes, you did.
Jack!
Ashi?
It's not me!
Of course it is, sweetheart.
You wouldn't let your daddy get hurt by that bad ol' Samurai.
Jaaack!
I can't stop this!
I can't control myself!
You must fight it!
Fight!
Aah!
I'm trying!
Ashi, focus!
Break free!
I mean, you try and raise them right, then they run off with your mortal enemy.
What's a dad to do?
Jack!
Nothing is working!
Don't give in.
Fight, Ashi.
Fight it!
Ashi, you are not your father.
You are not your mother.
You are your own person.
You are good.
You can defeat him from inside.
Boring!
Sweetheart, you have to bring out your best to defeat him, and your best part is meeeee!
