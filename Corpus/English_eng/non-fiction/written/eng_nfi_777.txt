My name is Chef Jeff.
And I'm Dev Shah.
We're good friends that love to travel...
And to eat.
This is BFFs.
When it's cold in New York City, that means it's ramen season.
Today, I'm gonna take Dev to Okonomi in Williamsburg.
Chef Katoman doles out some of my top noodles in this town.
Dev, are you hungry?
Uh, yes, I am.
My man.

Wow.

"Maze" means "to mix."
- Right?

And the thing about this ramen is that it is completely broth-less.
So you really have to take the chopsticks.
- And really mix it up.

See how moist it gets?
Twirling, Jeff, I think I got a-a dangerous-looking bite coming up here.
- Do you see this right here?

- I'm about to eat this.

You know how bad it is just to spend time with you, enjoy the moment, and then go back home, lie in bed with your actual fiancé?
You know, sometimes...
I mean, I know it...

Sometimes, I wish he was cheating on me.
It would be so much easier to just break up.
Maybe he is cheating on you, he's just really good at hiding it.
Let's just assume he's cheating on you.
Maybe he's sleeping with some woman named Tanya right now.
Stop it.
This is bad.

It's not that easy.
I wish we could have met each other when we were both single.
'Cause you think that I would immediately say,
"Oh, my God, Dev.
Finally, I met you."
Hey, you don't think if we met each other at a bar or something that we'd hit it off?

Maybe not?

You know he has a gambling problem!
Why'd you let him near those dice?
What'd you think he was gonna do?
Play Monopoly?
I was just giving him a little taste, all right?
To get him through the night.
How was I supposed to know he was gonna get in some dirty cab, and never come back?
But you know how the story goes.
He has a problem, Tommy!
What's it gonna take for you to say no to your baby brother?
I got problems too, right?
I got a lot of problems, Zeke!
Baby brother this.
Baby brother that.
That's all I get.
Well, I used to be a baby brother once too, remember?
Until I saw Richie fall off the roof of that construction site.
And I gotta see that again!

And again!

And again!

Every night before I got to bed!
So you keep telling me, "Hey, man, go save someone."
Well, how about somebody come and save me?
How bout just once somebody come and save me?
So sleep tight, asshole, 'cause the Hammond Estates are closed.
Wow.
Two-man show.

- Yeah.

It's an intense play.
Yeah, it's really intense.

How do you remember all that dialogue?
Oh, man, sometimes I forget big chunks.
Like, even tonight, that whole riff on P.F. Chang's,
I...

Yeah, it seemed a little off-story.
- I think it worked.

- But you like doing the theater?

You know, it's great schedule.

But I got my days free, so I've been doing a lot of puzzles and, uh, watching a lot of TV.
Mm.

No.

That sounds terrible.
Uh, I used to host it.
Oh.

No.

That guy Lil' Romeo hosts now.
Oh, I know Romeo.
I played his driving instructor in, uh, Life in the Fresh Lane.
Wow, I...

Oh, it was about a kid from the inner city who moved to the country to learn how to drive.
It was fun, man.
I made up a lot of stuff on that too.
So what are you working on now?
I'm actually doing a new show with that guy Chef Jeff, it's called BFFs.
It's like a travel show, and we just travel around the world, eating food.
- It's great.

- Chef Jeff?

Yeah, I heard of him.

I'd be careful with that guy.
Why do you say that?
Whatever.

It's none of my business.
Well, don't say some shit like that and not tell me.
What's going on?

All right, I've heard through the grapevine that Chef Jeff is a little bit of a creep.
- What?

My wife's friend was food stylist on, like,
Jeff's Backyard Barbeque or some show, and she said he hit on her and, like, every other woman on the crew.
And at one point, he crossed the line.
What happened?
Well, they were, like, shooting late one night, right?
And he offered her a ride home.

And the minute she got in the car, he made a move on her.
And she was like, "Hey, Chef Jeff, I'm married."
And he was like,
"You want to go home and bang that loser husband of yours?
Or do you want to spend a legendary night at Casa de Jeff?"
- Are you serious?

And you know the thing about it is?
Her husband?

His name is Matteo.

What am I gonna do?

I don't know, man.

I'm glad I don't have to deal with it.
All right, man.
You got these, right?
Um, yeah.
Hey, Lisa.
Hey, Dev.

What's up?
We were just shooting nearby.
I thought I'd come say hello.
- Cool.

You know, my skin's lost its mocha glow.
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sure Graham will hold it down for you.
Graham sucks!
Well, he's not as good as me, but he is a very nice guy.
Hey, there's a donut truck out front.
- You want to go grab?

Cool.
So how's the new gig?
Yeah, it's good, it's cool.
- Yeah?

We miss you over on BFFs.
I miss you too.
Aww.
Is there a reason you quit all of a sudden?
No, I just felt like I needed a change.
Yeah.
- Hey, between us...

Did... did some shit go down?
Uh, I don't know, did you hear about some shit going down?
I mean, was there someone maybe being a little weird...
Yeah.
Jeff was being a little weird with me.
- Oh, no.

What happened?
Well, he started off just making remarks about how I looked.
And then it just got a little out of hand.
He started getting flirty, asking me out for drinks.
At a certain point, I was like,
"Jeff, don't talk to me like that."
And he was like, "Ooh-whee.
She's a feisty one."
And I almost punched him in his face.
Oof.
So then he cooled off a bit.
But then we're on the road, and he'd do weird shit like slip me his room key.
And then one night he's, like, banging on my hotel room door for, like, ten minutes.
Oh, God.
Yeah, I just...
I don't know, I didn't feel safe working with him anymore.
Did you tell anybody?
Yeah, after the hotel thing,
I went and told Paula.
And she was like, "I talked to him.
It won't happen again."
And then like a week later, he started saying stuff about my ass again.
When I went back to her, she was like,
"I don't know what else I can do.
He's a flirty touchy-feely guy.
That's just the way he is."
Would it help if we talked to someone above Paula?
No.
No, it's fine, look,
I don't want to make a huge deal about it.
I'd rather just move onto this gig and forget about it.
Which sucks because he's probably doing fucked-up shit to other people too.
But... what am I gonna do, sue Food TV?
Have it take over my entire life?
No, I'd rather just keep it moving.
Jeez.
Um...
Feels kind of weird to go get donuts now.
I am game if you're game.
Sure.
- Cool.

Condone means approve.

I'm saying I don't condone the behavior, okay?
