It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss her on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe,
Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chillin' with my folks, I know
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
Word on the streets Santa's coming tonight
Reindeers flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe
Hey love, the Wise Men followed a star
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle
Aye love, don't you buy me nothing
'Cause I am feeling one thing
Your lips on my lips
That's a Merry Merry Christmas
It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss her on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
Show me baby that you love me so
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
Show me baby that you love me so
