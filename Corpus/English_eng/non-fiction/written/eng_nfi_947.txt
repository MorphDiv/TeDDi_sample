Good morning, Claire...

Who's Claire?
You're late for work... again.
I'm on London time.
Well, then you're eight hours late.
Business day starts at 9:00 a.m., Pacific Standard Time.
And we arrive dressed.
- Having had.

Breakfast.
At the kitchen island.
Not in the workspace.
I'm still picking veggie-bacon shards out of my keyboard from yesterday.
I eat and talk with gusto, Grace.
Especially when it's about our biz, about which I am highly jazzed, because I'm on a roll.
I mean, I'm hot, man.
Not only am I an artist, I'm also a businesswoman.
I'm a hyphenate... or slash.
What do you think?
I don't know, ask Claire.
- I have an announcement to make.

When do we talk about new business?
All right, new business, 10:15.
- Can I make my announcement?

We have an appointment tomorrow at an incubator.
We're getting chickens?
We are not getting chickens!

Then why are we going to an incubator?
It's a business incubator, Frankie.
You know, where new businesses find funding and start-up support.
We don't belong at a bank with our company.
We belong someplace where new ideas are embraced and...
Frankie, are you even listening to me?
No, not since you said we're never getting chickens.
Is it 10:15 yet?
I give up.

Hold onto your seatbelts, or hat.
No, you don't wear hats.
But you should.

- Okay, new business is over.

We've talked about making a bunch of different products for older adults.
Well, older adults need easy-open condoms.
And where may I ask did this great idea come from?
I had a dream.
Let me set the scene for you:
I was shaving a cat, only it wasn't a cat.
And it wasn't me...
Good morning.

Um...
Your truck keys?
I, uh...

Thanks.
See you later?
You had a "dream."
Oh, there were dreams all right, Grace.
Dreams fulfilled.
"Dreams" plural?
Multiple dreams?
Frankie, how could you not tell me about this?
Grace, I am a private person.
You are the least private person in the world!
First time I met you, you pulled up your shirt and said,
"Do these things look right?"
Look, I haven't had time to tell you because my whole life has been working with you and sleeping with Jacob.
This is why we need more coffee breaks.
I have been there for every "should I" and "shouldn't I" with you two.
How could you leave me hanging now?
I don't know.

And you were right, it is a big deal.
Right?
Turns out sex is pretty good with a man who's not closing his eyes and pretending you're a man.
True, but condoms are hell to open and having a pair of scissors on the bedside table just doesn't set the right... tone.
You guys use condoms?
I still haven't emerged completely from perimenopause.
I'm gonna bet you have.
Well, regardless, Jacob is a pretty hot number, and I don't want to wonder every time I get a new itch or scratch down there.
Okay, score one for safe sex.
We're making a vibrator first.
We have to concentrate on that.

Keep that thinking cap on.

I love our new house.
I love our new fan in our new house.
If I wasn't married to you, I'd marry that fan.
"Man marries ceiling fan.

Enough joy for one morning.

I could stomach more joy.
There's plenty of joy to be had at work.
There's none.
- Come on.

- Up and at 'em!

You're just a mean old lawyer.
He's gonna be here in ten minutes.
That's why I'm pretending to be working.
Well, then here are those imaginary file folders you asked for.
Yeah.
Hi.
Got a sec?
Yeah, I was just working.
Oh, Barry's here.
You can send him right in and then get out.
Okay.
Hey.
So, Sharon from HR is insisting I do this, uh, exit interview with you.
- You're actually leaving?

I told you I was leaving.
I gave my two-weeks' notice and I got another job.
So, yeah, pretty much.
How do I know that box isn't full of office supplies?
Is this funny to you?
No, it's not funny to me.

I don't understand how we got here.
That's the problem.
You don't.
I like you, you like my dog, we both hate Sharon.
Why isn't that enough?
It isn't.
Not for me.
I don't like how this interview is going, so I'm canceling it and you can't exit.
Goodbye, Brianna.
Nope.
Well, well, well.
And here I had a whole speech prepared for when you were late again.
Ah, well, save it for tomorrow.
- Oh, hello.

Yeah, I can see that.
Um...
Uh, the only thing is, you know, I took a vote and we agreed to eat at the kitchen island.
This table is our office now.
Oh, I'm sorry.
So many rules to keep track of.
But since he's new here, he can have one last breakfast in the conference room.
Of course.
And please let the minutes reflect
I ate my corn flakes before work, at the kitchen island.
Along with half a pineapple stuffed with cookie dough.
Noted.
So, our meeting with the incubator is at 2:00.
And I've made an outline of exactly what I think we should say.
I also hid all your clogs.
Oh, not all of them.
Did you bring it?
- What?

Oh!
- New business is at 10:15.

- What now?

Frankie has a really good idea.
Well, you know, it's funny.
Jacob and I were talking last night about the business...
Oh.

Well, you know me, Grace.

I don't just shut it down at 3:00 like you do.
We work till 5:00.
We were thinking, condoms might go over well at an incubator where a lot of young men work.
Well, based on what I know about tech guys,
I don't think they're having a lot of sex.
- Hear us out.

We even mocked up a package.

Well...
You poke... and it pops right out.
"Poke and Pop."
We're still working on the name.
Okay, you know what?

But right now, we have a meeting in five hours.
Which is why we only wanted five minutes of your time now.
Do we want the money for the prototype or do we want to sit here and think up new ideas?
We want to sit here and think up new ideas!
We're not doing that.
That should be the name of your autobiography.
I don't get it.
That should be the name of her autobiography.
Oh!
Unknown caller.
Maybe I shouldn't answer.
Hello?

Hi, Trevor.
Of course I care about the snow leopards.
Why?

Uh-huh.
Oh, really?
Oh, this is terrible.
Jacob...
I really love having a fresh voice at the table.
You know, my ex-husband had some great ideas when I started Say Grace.
But?
Yeah, but, um...
You know sometimes it's really hard to get Frankie to focus on one thing.
You've seen her try to watch fireworks.
I don't want her distracted.
I think you just don't like it when you don't get your way.
I don't think anyone likes it when they don't get their way.
I think you like it a lot less than the rest of us.
You know what, I think I'll be more comfortable in the studio.
Do you have a problem with me?
Actually, I do.

You were horrible to her the day you crashed my lunch with the boys.
All right, I apologized to Frankie for that.
I didn't apologize to you.

I had way too much to drink that day, which is not an excuse.
No.

But you know what they say:
when someone shows you who they really are, believe them.
That is not who I really am.
Frankie forgave me for that.
That's one of the things I love about Frankie.
She's very forgiving.
Yes, of course you can count on my support, just let me get my credit card.
Grace, can I have your credit card?

I'm getting my roommate's credit card.
Where is the thing that turns these into toast?
Um...
- It's here somewhere.

The nightmare begins.
The daily deluge of emails about
Gina Taylor-Tang's divorce have started, and so has my acid reflux.
What is it this time?
They seem to be taking very strong stands about the silverware.
Gina is willing to let him have the shrimp fork...
No, no, wait... now he wants her to have them so, quote, "she will have something to eat shrimp with in hell."
Really?

I'm watching a hummingbird.
Wait...
I'm watching a family of hummingbirds.
- That's an omen.

That we'll need to get a hummingbird feeder.
I could watch them all day.
Then it's settled.

What?
You can watch them all day, but not at the office.
So, like you said, we're staying home.
- You said we're staying home.

Where are you going?
To change into my stay-at-home clothes.
Robert, we have to go to work.
We don't have to do anything, but unpack and buy that hummingbird feeder.
Aren't we a little too old to play hooky?
Not necessarily.

Yes, hello, Bud?

Hey, listen, your dad and I are not feeling so good.
So... we'll come in if you really need us, but I'd advise everyone to wear a face mask.
Okay, thank you so much.
Ugh.

- I almost walked out of my clogs.

- Hi.

- We have a meeting with Highsmith.

Welcome to Partner'd.

Oh, but no, we're all full up on chunky jewelry.
Speak for yourself.
Oh, no.

I'll tell Highsmith you're here.
In the meantime, have a seat, help yourself to room-temperature liquids.
Oh, well, maybe later.

Stop it.
Let's get on our phones so we fit in.
I pride myself on not fitting in, but okay.
So here's the plan.
I'll talk first, and I'll keep talking, and you don't talk.
Bye, girl.

That's Highsmith.
Oh!

Come on, Frankie.
Just remember, under no circumstances do you bring up the condoms.
Got it.

This is an incubator.

But when it's an incubator for chickens, they have a whole bunch!
This is an incubator for human babies, one human baby.
And stop with the damn chickens.
- Have a seat.

Oh, God.
You guys okay there?
- I'm gonna say "no."

Does this bother you?

- Not at all.

Great.

Well... as you may know, baby boomers are one of the most under-served consumer demographics.
I've heard that.
And it's a demo made up of by far more single women than single men.
Makes sense.

Single women in their 60s and 70s are the fastest-growing segment of the adult population.
- Really?

And while their bodies may have changed, their desire has not.
We at Vybrant intend to make the very first vibrator designed specifically for the 60-plus woman's body.
- That is fucking dope!

- Is "dope" good?

You know what else is hella dope?

Frankie.
We call them "Let Her Rip."
I love it.

He loves it all!
These are great ideas and you're both fantastic.
I see us getting stoned and watching The Muppets Take Manhattan together.
Oh, I'd be down.
And I want to bring you home and have you organize my closets.
Well, I'm very good at that.
But I can't help you.
- Why not?

We're disruptors.

You break shit?

We break other people's shit.

That's our new rash-identification app.
But we're that.

- Disruptors.

Nobody's ever done this.
We could revolutionize a whole market.
And I believe it.

We're a tech company.
Not a making-things company.
Sorry.
We'll always have this, though.
Oh.
Grace, wait, wait, wait!
Didn't I tell you not to bring up those freaking condoms?
What does it matter?

Why are you so mad at me?
We had a vision and a plan for a vibrator!
And now it's all "Poke 'n' Pull" and "Let 'Em Rip"
and our vibrator has been kicked to the curb!
Well, you may not need a vibrator anymore, but I still do.
- Oh, I do.

You're too busy burning through those fancy condoms with your boyfriend.
Who hates me, by the way.
- No, Jacob doesn't hate you.

Ever since that day I got drunk and ruined your lunch.
Well, he is a little touchy about that.
Well, now I'm a little touchy about this.
And now it's raining.

Can I just...
Oh, here.

- Isn't it in your...

You know, peeking in a woman's purse is akin to looking up her skirt, just FYI.
And is that stapler yours?
It is not.
Aren't you glad we stayed home this rainy day?
- Well...

It was killing you, having all these boxes everywhere.
Look at you, you're in bubble-wrap heaven.
God, this is good.
Wait a second, I thought these were supposed to go into storage.
Our CDs?

No, no, this is a smart house.

What does that mean?
I'm not exactly sure, but I know it has something to do with this.
Some Pirates of Penzance, perhaps?
- How about Little Richard?

- Why?

You are so bossy in our new house.
That's what you love about me.

Bud?
Bud, is that you?
Oh, you're blind now?
Fancy meeting you here.
Where else would I be after it rains?
I know this isn't a problem you can throw yarn at, but can I throw a donut at it?
Perhaps.
Okay.
So, look, I'm not the best at apologies.
Um...
That's all you needed to say.
Hard to find the right words.
Here.

Anything yet?
- No, but here comes one.

That doesn't look so deep.
Wrong.
Fuck.
- That usually makes us laugh.

I can tell you why I'm not.
I'm having trouble with my boyfriend and my best friend.
Oh, Bud and Coyote are fighting?
Solid burn.
What did my mother do now?
It's complicated.
Business stuff.

And business stuff.
What?
What?
Are you okay?
Yes.
Oh, look, there's a guy with a Frisbee about to fall in that puddle.
Uh-uh, Missy.
You want a full pardon, tell me what's really going on.
It would appear that Barry and I have broken up.
Oh, no.

Are you all right?
Not really.

- It still sucks.

Usually I'm just out with the old, in with the new, but this is different.
It's like this pain in my... red blood thing.
Thank you, I wasn't sure where it was.
I just hate that I hurt him.
Look, honey, if it wasn't right for you, it wasn't right for anybody.
Believe me, I've been through it.
I needed to hear that.

- Oh, that woman has a cane.

- Ma'am!

Ma'am, it is not safe!
She's okay.
So, problems in vibrator land?
Yeah.

Wait, what?

Well, your mom is a big, fat, skinny liar.
She must be freaking out.
Kind of.
I guess I could get ten dollars from every person I know.
Do you think I know 7500 people?
Or, instead of getting a little money from a lot of people, you could get a lot of money from one person.

Oh, I haven't talked to Paul Reubens in years.
No, me, Frankie.
Oh, I can't ask you for that.
You're not asking, I'm offering.

On one condition:
your partner can never know that the money came from me.
She would think it was pity, and she doesn't do pity.
True dat.
You're really going to give us the money?
Ooh, "give" is a strong word.
I am going to heroically loan you the money for purely selfish reasons.
Clearly, I will be single at 70 and in dire need of a good vibrator.
I will hand deliver one to you on your 70th birthday.
Won't you be really super dead?
If they make the advances in cryogenics I truly believe possible, no.
Okay.
Here.

There's not falafel in there again, is there?
No, I ate that.
Oh, oh, oh, you don't want that.
- Oh.

A couple loose candies and a condom.
The complete contents of my tenth grade purse.
Okay.

Okay, stop, Frankie.

Thanks again for the soup.
It was delicious.
You're welcome, even though you don't deserve it.
Next time you want to take a day off, take a day off.
I fell in a puddle on my way to the soup place and saw Mom on a park bench laughing at me.
Your mom might be the nicest person in the world, but she does love watching people fall down.
She claims she tried to warn me.

Hey, listen, Bud, we're sorry we left you with that crazy Gina Taylor-Tang.
Oh, she's tough, man.
She does not suffer fools.
But she's smart, and I'm pretty sure she was happy with me when she left.
Happy?

Well, that's the way Bud goes.
Okay, she just texted me, and "I'm not happy."
That sounds more like her.
We'll be back tomorrow.
Okay.

Love you.
What's wrong?
I don't want to go back to work tomorrow.
He knows we're not sick.
Although, I still have the neck brace and crutches from my gardening accident.
We could say we took a tumble moving boxes.
Sol, I don't know if I ever want to go back to work again.
What?

It's no fun anymore.
Do you remember when it was fun?
It's fun being with you.
Yes, but why do we have to be together there?
I've been thinking about this a lot.
Dare I mention the "R" word?
Racism?
No, silly.

Oh.
It must have crossed your mind.
Apparently not as much as it's crossed yours.
If you don't wanna talk about it now, it's all right.
No, I...
I've thought about it.
And?
- I'm not sure I'm ready.

Is this really what you want?
All I want is to be in this house dancing in two different rooms with you.
You might be the sweetest man I've ever met.
Might?
- Hey!

What you doing?
Well, there's this thing called Kickstarter.
Sounds awful, but it's either that or we sell Mallory's kids for the 75,000.
Or we can just use this.
Where did you get that money?
Grace, I cannot lie to you.
Do you remember that prince who wrote to me from Nigeria?
Um...
Well, I was cleaning out my car...
Hey.

Oh, can I help you with that?
I got it.
Jacob gave me the money.
Get out of here.
Yes, the check.

He can afford that?
Oh, please, he's loaded.
Why do you think I'm with him?
See?

He believes in us and he forgives you.
He does?
Yes, of course he does.

Oh, he shouldn't be.
Well, he is, but there's one stipulation:
he wants us to use the money for the vibrator.
Our vibrator.
It's okay to talk about the condoms.

- Impossible?

I was gonna say "determined."
Well, I said "impossible" first.
But you're not.

A good plan that I believe in.
- Where are you going?

Oh, oh, you can't!

I said there was one, but there's two.
He doesn't like messy thank yous.
You want Cheetos on your salad again, because I bought them.
Jacob.
Oh, Jacob.
Oh.
This is how a WASP apologizes.
