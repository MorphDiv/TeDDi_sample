Previously on "Colony"...
I know you took the file.
I didn't take anything from your house.
You get us something from that suit.
Holy shit, it worked.
Whoa, why are you taking the gauntlet?
Hennessey's gonna hold on to it.
We'll take good care of it.
- What happened?

Will's in trouble.
His team raided one of the Red Hand safe houses.
Will found a kid hiding inside and helped him escape, and now they're out looking for the kid.
- Who are you?

Katie, we've got company.
Hey!
How did you escape the safe house?
They're gonna torture him.
Come on.

I will not tolerate... [gunfire]
- Where are they?

Bram.
Hey, we got to get in the air before a patrol spots us.
Plane hasn't been flown in over a year.
Just gotta make sure the engine doesn't conk out.
There has to be another way.
Yeah?

Teleportation?
This plane has no electronics.
They won't see us coming.
Yeah, but that's... see, that's just a theory.
It's a theory that's been tested.
Their sensors on the walls don't care about analog signals.
What about the drones?
We'll come out of the sun, and we'll bail out before they can spot us.
It's gonna work.
- I hate flying.

Should've thought of that before you volunteered.
We're good.

A plane flew in from outside the bloc.
Drone shot this guy down, but his partner escaped and went to ground.
Why would somebody want to fly a plane into the bloc?
I plan on asking him.
I didn't realize your wife was related to Madeline Kenner.
Yeah.

Oh, oh.
According to your file, they both grew up in a military family.
- Navy.

Typically, military families are close.
Do they fight much?
Like I said, they're sisters.
How often does your wife go visit Ms. Kenner in the Green Zone?
What's with all the questions?
I just want to get to know the Bowman family a little bit better.
Let's talk about you, Bob.
What's your story?
Any family?

Or you just power down in a closet at work every night?
Oh, I've got a lot of friends.

Probably because I understand that our line of work and friendship doesn't mix.
[body thuds] [dog barking]
Good talk.
We're gonna need to bag all this up for the Blackjacks.
Go get your equipment from the van.
The dead jumper is Darin Gunn, a former lieutenant in the Marines.
Seems to have been outside the Walls during the Arrival.
Yes.

I want to know what you're doing to find his partner, the one who escaped.
Let's not make this bigger than it is.
We'll cover up the crash site, I'll tell a convincing story, and by next week, nobody in my bloc will even remember what happened.
Recent reports from IGA intelligence indicate that there is a growing Resistance movement outside the Colony.
What if this was an attempt to recover our host's missing gauntlet and take it beyond our Walls?
That seems unlikely.
Well, it doesn't have to be true.
IGA simply needs to think that it's a possibility.
Let's not fixate on the worst-case scenario.
Things are trending upward in the bloc.
You're right.
I'll have to remember to remain optimistic as we're all being renditioned.
Find the pilot.
It'll be good for you and your bloc.
Understand?
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, sweetie.
- What's going on?

Hey, so... when Bram wakes up, tell him to stay here, okay?
Okay.
We'll be home soon.
All they do is sleep.
They're boys, my love.

- See you tonight.

[tense music]
You think the pilot might still be alive?
He escaped into the bloc.
So we have to find him before the Occupation.
The dead jumper had a radio in his backpack.
I memorized the frequency and then scrambled it.
Will Bowman... that's a clever piece of sabotage.
Just trying to keep up.
I'll go to Broussard.
If the pilot really is Resistance, he might reach out.
Okay.
Come on, let's go!
Bob's been asking questions about you.
Do you think they broke the kid from the safe house?
- I don't know.

Once we disappear, the kids are fugitives... forever.
Let's meet for lunch, exchange notes, okay?
Be safe.
I will.
So Hennessey knew a plane was coming?
He didn't say that exactly.
But he told me he had spoken to a group outside the bloc that wanted to make contact.
I assumed he meant a cell that was in...
San Fernando or Santa Monica.
The green glove...

Listen, Blake, if you let me go, it's yours.
It's worth enough to make you rich for the rest of your life.
- Yeah?

Hey.
We came about the pilot.
In peacetime, I'm an art dealer, antiques.

We also found an odd anomaly.
Some of the earlier surveillance files are missing.
What do you mean, "missing"?
I thought we had built redundancies into the system.
We did.

I went back and examined the logs.
All the files were erased from the same computer terminal over a 15-minute period.
