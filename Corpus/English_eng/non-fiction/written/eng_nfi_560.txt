Previously on The Affair...
Just because he was convicted doesn't mean he's guilty.
The only person who doesn't think he did it is you.
This isn't a relationship.
We live completely separate lives.
My kids, your... your... your cactus.
Home sweet home.
Come and say good-bye to your father.
His advisor wants to have a parent/teacher conference next week.
Noah?
I'm here.
I'm sorry to have scared you.
I was hoping that this wouldn't be so complicated.
I don't want the house.
Dad left it to you.
I'm never going back there, Nina.
He was trying to apologize.
My mother died there.
She was sick for a long time, and she told me that she decided to die.
You don't remember me, do you?
Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania?
Fuck.
_
Are you sure she's gonna make it?
Yeah, she's just running late.
How long have you been dating this woman?
On and off for a while now.
How come you've never mentioned her?
Well, I know how sensitive you are, darling.
I wouldn't want you to be heartbroken if it didn't work out between us.
So what's she like?
You know, she's... a lot like you.
Like me?
Ta-da.
Hello, darling.
Mom?
Surprise.
Okay, what is happening here?
We're back together.
Well, it's... it's really great to finally meet you, Vik.
We've heard so much about you.
I haven't heard about him.
Well, neither have I, really, but, uh, he seems great.
Well, I'm happy to meet you guys, too.
I mean, it's taken long enough.
Congrats on your remarriage.
Okay, you're not actually getting remarried, are you?
Well, we never really finalized the divorce.
Okay, well, when did you even start talking?
Let's not discuss the details.
Ina left me, and, uh, I went back to your mom.
Aren't you happy for us, Helen?
Well, I'm thrilled for you, darling.
This fella's quite a catch.
I don't understand why you kept him hidden all this time.
He's wonderful... handsome, polite, a doctor.
And at your age, Helen...
See, she's not really thinking about the words before she says them.
It's just pure stream of consciousness, what you're hearing right now.
Anyone would be an improvement after your first husband.
So how is Noah?
Do they know who stabbed him?
No, they don't.
I wish I'd thought of that myself years ago.
Could've saved my family a lot of heartache.
He's kidding.
I don't care if he's kidding.
You can't say things like that.
He's the father of your grandchildren.
Well, he hasn't really seen very much of them recently, has he?
Doesn't make much of a difference to them if he's locked away in jail or if he's dead.
Of course it makes a difference.
He's still very much involved in their lives.
As a matter of fact, he's coming to Martin's school tomorrow to meet with his advisor.
Oh, Christ.
That's a dreadful idea.
You're trying to impress them, not terrify them.
You should take Vik.
I'd be happy to go.
Can we please change the subject?
So how is married life treating you guys, huh?
We realized we couldn't live without each other, right, dear?
That's right.
The truth is, at the end of the day, your mother just knows me... better than anyone else ever will.
That's beautiful.
Ooh.
But they're entertaining.
And it's great they're back together.
Vik, my father walked out on my mother with a student and completely ruined her life, and now she's just taking him back and pretending that none of it ever happened.
And, oh, my God, all that bullshit about second chances... and how they know each other?
I'm still glad you introduced us.
It feels like a big step.
Hey...
A joint wedding.
Excuse me?
Yeah, your parents renew their vows, and we get hitched.
I'll bet your dad would even pay for it.
Think of all the money we'd save.
You are joking, right?
Of course I'm joking, Helen.
Don't have a heart attack.
You're hilarious, you know that?
Did you ever think about giving up surgery, going into stand-up comedy?
Yes, I have.
He's not coming.
Yeah, I'm sure he's coming.
He's definitely not coming.
Well, unfortunately, the period is now half over.
We must have our discussion with or without Mr. Solloway.
Well, as a matter of fact, Mr. Solloway's absence provides us with a bit of a segue into the dilemma we face.
You see, our problem is that Martin, far too frequently, chooses not to come to school.
What do you mean he chooses not to come to school?
Have you been cutting class?
We give the seniors a heavy workload to prepare them for what they'll face in college.
Now, at this rate, Martin's chances of finishing the required courses and successfully graduating in the spring, well, they're rapidly diminishing.
This is his second senior year.
Where have you even been going?
Um...
I just want you to understand what's been going on with Martin.
He's had a very difficult few years.
He was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, which is why he had to leave public school.
He was legitimately very sick.
So is that what's going on, Mr. Solloway?
Answer him.
I feel okay.
I mean it.
Don't bring him into this.
But it's been a very difficult time for the entire family.
Ex-husband.
My ex-husband is completely innocent.
I have to go to lunch.
Well, we're not done here.
Well, I would say we are.
You know, Martin should go to lunch, and as you promised, Mrs., um...
Well, as you said, the two of you will discuss this at home.
And, Martin, I trust you understand how high the stakes are for you.
What is the matter with you?
I mean, seriously?
I can't believe you actually thought he was gonna show up.
No, he didn't.
He just got released from the hospital.
I don't fucking care!
You shouldn't have even told him about this meeting.
He shouldn't be in our lives anymore.
He killed someone, Mom!
Why can't you just admit that?
I got to go.
God damn it, Noah, pick up your fucking phone!
Helen.
Uh, what are you doing here?
I was in the neighborhood, and I thought I'd stop by.
Oh.
Oh, this neighborhood?
Uh, is Noah here?
You know where he is?
Livingston, I assume?
No, I don't think so, because I've been calling him and calling him, and his phone is turned off.
Do you think something happened to him?
What time was the meeting?
Well, noon?
Noon in the city, and... you made your way out to New Jersey hours later?
You okay, Helen?
I'm concerned about him because he was stabbed, and now he's MIA.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah.
Why does he still matter so much to you?
Because he's the father of my children, and he's blowing his last chance to have any semblance of a relationship with them.
I understand about the kids, but maybe... maybe it's best for all of you just to... let him go.
What?
My brother's fucked up, you know.
He wasn't fucked up when I met him.
After all those years together...
Yet... wow.
Yet what?
It's... it's actually... it's funny.
Excuse me?
My brother was shattered when you met him.
Our mother had just died, and I don't know if you know, but...
You know, maybe he hid it really well from you.
I knew he was grieving, Nina.
It's one of the things that drew me to him.
Helen, okay, look,
I know you thought you found a diamond in the rough that you were just gonna polish and shape and place on your dainty fingers and...
Let me tell you what actually was going on.
Noah was using you.
He was using you to get the fuck away from us, and he knew the fastest way to do that was to marry some control-freak rich girl.
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?
Didn't you find it odd how Noah didn't... didn't mind at all spending every holiday with your family, never once taking a vacation with us?
Because it was difficult for him to be with Arthur.
Why?
Because your father wasn't very nice to him, Nina.
Because he's an asshole.
He wasn't to me!
Well...
I'd... something must have happened between them.
Yes!
Okay, w-what... what was it?
My brother has been in pain, in pain for years, and you did not see it.
You know, I certainly didn't come here to get all this resentment heaped on me.
I'm sorry you're carrying around so much anger, but I have to go.
Hey, Helen.
Who was driving the car that killed Scott Lockhart?
As far as I know, Noah was.
And you believe that?
He confessed.
No evidence to convict him.
He basically stood up in that court, and he... volunteered to go to prison.
Maybe he felt guilty.
Where were you that night?
I was at home asleep.
Helen Solloway.
Ha ha.
I mean, if it's a bad time or if it's inconvenient or you have company...
Okay.
Helen the felon.
Is that really you?
Hi, Max.
I'm glad you did.
Uh, let me take your stuff.
Can I get you glass of wine?
Um... no, I really shouldn't.
I mean, the kids are home, and it's a school night, and I-I just was gonna come by for a minute and say hi.
Yeah, I'm just gonna pour you a glass of wine.
Okay.
Are you moving?
Brooklyn Heights?
Isn't that a little suburban for your taste?
What inspired that?
I'm getting married.
Cheers.
I know, I know.
Her name's Danielle.
Uh-huh.
Met her at the gym.
What is she, your trainer?
Wow, fancy.
She's smarter than me, more successful, much better looking.
I'd say between the two of us, I'm winning.
Between me and you?
No, right, I'm sorry.
A lot can happen in three years.
Yep.
I thought of you recently while we were looking at venues.
Of me?
We checked out Gedney Farms.
Mm-hmm.
Twenty-five.
Exactly, uh... yesterday.
Is that possible?
Yep.
Quarter of a century.
Yep.
We're that old?
Is this her?
I guess I'm not the love of your life anymore.
What?
Will you kiss me?
I knew you first.
Oh.
Um... you still with that guy, Vik?
Yeah.
Cool.
Just checking.
Hey.
Helen, come on, talk to me.
Was Noah fucked up when I met him?
Um... yeah, he was totally fucked up.
I mean, his mom had just died.
I know, but he didn't... talk about it.
No, no, but you could just sense it.
Do you think Noah was using me?
Using you?
But, yeah, also, I think...
I mean, he knew who he was marrying
I don't know... all of a sudden, everyone's trying to convince me that I didn't know this man, my husband, the father of my children.
Just because things went wrong and... doesn't mean the whole story has to change.
All right, you know what?
I have... um...
I made a terrible mistake.
You need to go.
Fine.
I cannot believe I fell for this shit again.
I mean, I thought maybe... maybe this time it was about us, but it's never about us, because it's always about him.
I just want to... can I just ask you one question?
What is it?
Did Noah ever cheat on me in college?
Please get the fuck out of here.
Please go.
Hi.
Oh, hey.
What are you reading?
Oh.
Your dad's book.
Why?
I want to get to know him better.
Why would you want to do that?
I thought we were trying to establish a rapport.
Isn't that why we had dinner with them?
That's the last thing I want to do.
Okay.
People don't know what they want.
Well... it's nice to see you.
Hey, what time did Martin get home?
He's not home yet?
I thought maybe he was with you.
Well, did you think to check, Vik?
All right, I'm going upstairs.
Can't I even get a kiss?
I need to call my son.
Is he back yet?
No.
Fuck it, I'm calling the police.
You need to calm down.
Now, Martin will be home any minute.
Just that she tends to overreact.
You don't know anything about me or my family, Vik.
Well, four, but who's counting?
You don't know anything about my parents, and you barely know my kids, and sometimes I feel like you're just a stranger living in my house!
I don't know your kids?
I'm not here with them every day?
You know, running lines with Trevor, helping Martin with his chem, picking Stacey up from fucking art class?
Tell me, Helen.
Tell me, how have I failed you?
Where have you been?
Hey, we were worried about you, buddy.
You should've called.
I'm going out.
I need a drink.
Come in.
Where were you?
I was with Dad.
What?
Where?
At the lake house.
Look, Ma, I'm really tired.
Let's just talk about this tomorrow.
So you...
Um... you managed to get yourself to Pennsylvania and Dad was there?
Yes, that's what I said.
What was he doing there?
I can't tell you.
It's between me and him.
Look, I'm going to bed.
I'll go to school tomorrow, I promise.
Um, if you need me, call my cell.
Noah?
Noah!
Stop!
Noah?
Stop!
_
Oh, no.
I'll pay for it, whatever the insurance doesn't cover.
The car belongs to the university.
You'll have to work it out with them.
I did love that car.
I'm so sorry.
I'm just happy you're all right.
The police came here again, you know.
They're very curious about why I happened to be there just after you were stabbed.
Fuck.
So you're wishing you never met me right now, right?
It's late.
Where are you going to stay tonight?
I-I don't know.
You can't go back to your apartment.
It's a crime scene.
Have you spoken to the detectives?
Uh, yeah, this morning.
Do they have any other leads besides me?
Not that I know of.
Brilliant.
You're not worried, are you?
I'm a little worried about you, but I promised myself I wouldn't ask you any questions, so...
Why not?
Because... this is not... a relationship.
This is, uh...
Une aventure.
Oh.
This bed it terrible.
It's fine.
It's fine.
Well, you're welcome to sleep with me.
Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
So you have, uh... some kind of arrangement with your husband when you're away?
Mm.
My husband suffers from Alzheimer's.
Sorry.
Oh, so am I.
But we don't have an arrangement, as you say.
Half the time he doesn't even remember he has a wife.
Or he thinks I'm his first wife... whom he loved better.
Sorry you asked?
A little.
Before I forget, you left these here when you took off last time.
I want you to tie me up.
What?
You wrote about it in your book.
I've never done anything like that.
I think I'd enjoy it.
Maybe I should get some rest.
If you leave early, don't wake me.
Help you?
No, I'm fine.
Holy shit, Solloway.
What are you doing in the boonies?
Oh, you're here to sell your dad's house.
Nobody wants to buy around here now.
We've been trying to sell our place for, like, a year.
Um, condolences, by the way.
Yeah, thanks.
Oh, I saw Nina a couple times when he was sick.
Really?
She looks good.
More like 30.
Ah, don't know about that.
You're working here, yeah?
You know, it's... the coal plant closed.
I got kids, so...
How old are your kids?
You got kids, right?
Yeah, I heard... you know, that you did some time.
No, it was in the paper.
You're kind of famous around here.
I mean, not everybody from this neck of the woods makes it into The New York Times.
You know, plenty go to jail, though, so, you know, you're sticking close to your roots in that regard.
Well, I better pay for these.
Come around to that other one, over here.
Lucy'd love to see you.
I-I married Lucy Corry.
I know, she wouldn't even look at me back then, right?
She came around.
We're on Lake Road, uh, just...
You could walk there from your dad's.
Jeez!
Dad?
Martin, what...
What are you doing?
Aren't you supposed to be in school?
Well, aren't you?
Oh, shit.
Where the hell were you?
I'm sorry.
Your grandfather left it to me.
To me.
I came here to be alone.
Grandpa said that whenever I wanted to, I could come here.
Now I have to fucking deal with you!
Martin.
Martin!
Martin.
I'm sleeping in here tonight.
Okay.
No, not... not really.
I'm gonna go to Denny's, then.
No, listen, I...
A friend of mine's invited me to dinner tonight.
You want to... maybe we go together?
A friend?
And he still talks to you?
What are you doing?
Clearing this place out.
You getting rid of everything?
Most of it.
Look, you see anything you want, it's yours.
I don't want any of this.
How about this?
What is it?
I actually think he'd have wanted you to have it.
What was that?
I hate school.
What did you say?
I said I hate school.
I want to join the Army.
Why would you want to do that?
'Cause I want to be like Grandpa.
Dad, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah, we kind of ran into each other.
Thanks.
Lucy Corry, of course.
Yeah, well, Lucy Finley now.
Nineteen.
Lila, come on down, meet our guests.
You want something to drink?
Oh, hey, you want a beer?
Just like high school.
Meet my old buddy Noah.
This is his son Martin.
Hey.
Hi.
Your kid's so much like you were.
I can't get over it.
You think so?
Yeah.
I can't really tell.
We kind of drifted apart.
Long time no see.
You don't remember me.
Stevie Johnson.
Good to see you.
I told Stevie you were in town.
He invited himself over for dinner.
Wasn't gonna miss this.
What's it been, 25 years, 30?
Yeah.
You disappeared, brother.
We all did.
You're filthy.
Where'd that chick come from?
It was like Fifty Shades of Fucking Solloway.
This is delicious.
Your mother always was a good cook.
Sure.
I think you broke some state records
You can't tell in the picture, though.
You can absolutely tell.
Which prom was that?
Uh, junior, I think.
Before, all Solloway cared about was getting into his rich-kid college.
Stevie, college is important.
Lila's going to college, right?
If I get in.
You'll get in.
I don't know how we'll pay for it, but you'll get in.
So, Solloway, what exactly happened to your neck?
Oh.
Explosion at the plant.
That's terrible.
At least I didn't get locked up.
I just can't see it, you in the slammer.
It's hilarious.
All right, Stevie, lay off.
You should've seen your dad at the end of high school, kid, studying like he was gonna be the next Albert Einstein... barely left his house senior year except to go to school.
Oh, come on, that had nothing to do with it.
Truth is Solloway always thought he was better.
But, well, look how it all turned out.
Turns out he's trash just like the rest of us.
Well, isn't this a real nice evening we're having?
Why don't you give him some credit?
You know, most people... they never get out of this town.
Your dad really did.
He did good.
Go where?
To Amber's, she's having a party.
I told her she could go.
Are you done with all your homework?
Yes, Dad.
Do you want to come?
No, that's okay.
Sure, sweetheart.
Thank you for dinner.
Anytime.
Jesus, Stevie!
Why do you always have to be such a dick?
Either of you remember a-a guy named Gunther?
John Gunther?
I think he lived in, um, Bloomsburg, went to East Side.
Yeah, his folks own that hunting store off 76.
Yeah, yeah, Gunther's, uh, Hunting and Shooting.
I passed it on the way in.
What about him?
We didn't know him personally, Solloway.
Not if he went to East Side.
Here you go.
You okay, Noah?
You don't look so good.
Dad, wake up.
Dad!
Dad, get up, come on.
Oh, God.
Hey, uh...
Hey.
How was the party?
It was fun.
Oh, that's good.
That's great.
Let me do it, come on.
Dad.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Why are you such a fucking mess?
Can I come in?
Fuck off.
What is it?
Read it.
What is it?
It's the note your grandmother left the night she died.
What, like a suicide note?
This looks like your handwriting.
It is.
Why?
Because... because I-I wrote it for her.
She was too sick to hold the pen, so...
I had to.
I...
I helped her die, Martin.
She was in so much pain, she just wanted a way out, and, uh... and I helped her.
Why are you telling me this?
I just...
And I know I've let you down.
I know I've let you down... severely.
And you may never be able to forgive me.
But I love you... more than you can possibly imagine.
You won't really know till you have your own.
One day when I die and you're clearing out my house, you won't be rehearsing conversations that...
You know you'll never have.
You got to go to school tomorrow morning.
Please?
Please go, for your mother.
Just let her see you graduate, and then after that, you can do whatever the fuck you want with your life.
Okay?
Yeah, okay.
Martin, get up.
Martin?
Martin!
