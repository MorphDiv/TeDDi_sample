- Training starts tomorrow.

We're doing this for different reasons, but people out there need our help.
You are attracted to Tyler, right?
I killed his brother.

What kind of idiot assaults someone
- while they're driving a Get In?

The son of Albert Mays.

- So there was two of them?

Yes, a spicy twist, indeed, but I planted tracking on both of them.
What do you know about Will and Tommy?
- It's a pattern.

She's the one who took the necklace.
Where did Jules say she found that necklace?
She said Ophelia found it outside of Zeta.
That's not what happened.
I can barely remember the girl that I was before I got raped.
Things have been good ever since we... cheated.
I hope that things continue in that direction.
Let's do this.
If you and your sick sidekick raise your hand against another woman, it'll be a world of trouble.

What can I do for you, Barton?
Oh, hi.

Yes, um, I was hoping I could have a minute of your time.
Tonight's assault wasn't the first of its kind on this campus.
Tommy Cope, Will Powell, both students who were attacked by the same masked assailant.
Always brutal attacks, never robberies, and the victims have one thing in common... they're accused rapists.
I think we have a vigilante situation on our hands.
Barton, that is quite a theory.
So these are all of Darlington's, um, sexual assault accusations that have gone uninvestigated.
We need to start tracking all the... the rapists across campus so that we can get to the victim of the next vigilante.
So this is the only way to get him.
This is impressive work, Barton.
It's very impressive.
I'm going to share this with my superiors.
I want to thank you for bringing this to my attention.
I mean, should I tell Tyler?

They wouldn't take you away.
They don't know there's two of us.
- Oh, yeah.

They don't know there's two of us.
Okay, I might have a plan that will keep Harris off your dick and me tied up long enough that the cops won't find me.
Right now, Harris has nothing.
I mean, he's just guessing.
But if he keeps looking, he will eventually figure it out, and if he convinces Barton...
Wait, that security guard?
Don't you call him Paul Blarton, Mall Cop?
Well, yeah.

You know, he's still a threat.
- Okay.

One person can't be in two places at once.
So if Harris has a run-in with the vigilante while you're there, logic suggests you're not the vigilante.
So you're gonna make appearance as a vigilante, like, right now, when we're in a lockdown and the police are looking for you?
Will you let me finish the plan?
God, sometimes you are so impatient.
Look, all I have to do is run through the store as the vigilante, making sure that Harris sees me, while you, Jules, not the vigilante, are also there.
I mean, if I keep the activity confined to the store, then I'll be up in my apartment before the cops even know what happened.
