That hurt.
Yeah, it hurts.
But the fact that I feel anything at all is what's blowing my mind.
Think that's the point.
All right, that's enough.
Well?
Unbelievable.
It's like the real thing.
I could even smell the sweat.
But I-I felt strangely cold, though.
Well, I tried to make the simulation as real as possible, and since you always leave the air-con on in the base,
I exaggerated it.
Kind of like a silent protest.
That was so realistic.
