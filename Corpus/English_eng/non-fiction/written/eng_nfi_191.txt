Justice for Katherine, justice for women!
Here to help save an innocent woman from the scaffold?
I believe that only God should have the power to take a life, but I can assure you that Katherine Corven is far from innocent.
Don't tell me you're gullible enough to believe the police's version of events?
But it seems, finally, she has decided to seek the forgiveness of God.
I should've known.
Another pawn in the male conspiracy to kill a strong-minded woman.
Excuse me.
Justice for Katherine!
All I know is she wants to make a confession.
Is the prison chaplain not available?
She asked for you by name.
Said she wouldn't speak to anybody else.
Do you believe she is truly repentant?
HE CHUCKLES
George will be outside, so shout if you need him.
Thank you.
A word of advice, Father.
Don't turn your back on her.
Not for a second.
So lovely to see you again.
I wasn't sure if you'd come.
I understand you're ready to confess your sins to God.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been years since my last confession.
What I tell you won't go any further, will it?
Whatever you say is between you, me, and Almighty God.
The Seal of the Confessional cannot be broken.
So, if you truly wish to confess, leave nothing out.
The affair, your husband's murder...
While there's nobody
I'd sooner share my darkest secrets with, Father,
I've told you before, my poor Bertie died of a completely natural heart attack.
Then why have you summoned me?
I wanted to get something off my chest.
You see... ..I've just arranged the death of my lover.
You remember Raymond, don't you?
Tell me, was that terribly naughty?
Knick-knacks for the tombola this weekend.
Why are you holding a letter behind your back then?
I'm not.
Let me see it.
This is no concern of yours.
What did Father Brown say?
I haven't showed it to him yet.
Do you remember that Katherine Corven woman?
Even the broadsheets went gaga for her trial.
And today he went to visit her in prison.
It probably dredged up some bad memories for him.
Anyway, this letter is just some foolish prank.
DOOR OPENS
Father!
Ah, Bunty, how are you?
Just peachy, thanks, Father.
Um, Mrs M has something she'd like to discuss with you.
There's someone I need to visit.
Can it wait till I get back?
He has a right to know.
GUNSHOT
I thought you were one of those blasted journalists.
I'm rather glad I'm not.
I heard the shot.
What happened?
That?
It was circling over my chickens.
I'm sorry if I alarmed you.
I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to talk after the trial.
I thought it best to make myself scarce before the mob descended.
Very wise.
So...to what do I owe the pleasure?
I just wondered how you were.
In that case, how about I put the kettle on?
There you are.
So, you've decided to move on.
As far away from Kembleford as possible.
I'm sick of the press hounding me, the voyeurs snooping around, hoping to catch a glimpse of Katherine Corven's lover.
That must be difficult.
I still get spat at in the street by people who think
I was involved in her husband's murder.
And then there are the letters.
Letters?
From Katherine, trying to convince me of her innocence.
Begging me to visit her.
And have you?
Once, recently, to tell her I was going away.
She got angry, so I left.
Why did you really come here?
I was concerned about you.
I assume you lock your door, with all these people snooping around?
Wait there.
Take it.
I'll be honest with you, Father, I don't trust myself with it.
I will put it somewhere safe.
Thank you.
One other thing...
My spare key to the cottage.
With all the press lurking around,
I'd sooner not leave it under a flowerpot.
Will you do me something in return?
Name it.
Please will you take care of yourself?
I intend to.
Sorry to bother you, Inspector.
Sorry, sir.
Well, it's a bit late now!
Well?
Gunshot reported near Frimley Copse.
Probably a farmer firing at a troublesome pest.
Thing is, sir, the witness reported the gunshot came from Raymond Worrall's cottage.
And?
Seeing as Worrall was involved in that Katherine Corven case,
A policeman's lot is not a happy one.
Inspector.
Thought you normally cycled TOWARDS gunshots.
Gunshots?
Oh, that was nothing.
What's that?
It's something I've been given to look after.
For a member of my flock.
Don't suppose it was Raymond Worrall?
We believe the gunshot came from his property.
He was scaring an eagle.
An eagle?
That's what he said.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm wanted in Kembleford.
Shall we head back to the station now, sir?
Not yet.
ENGINE STARTS
Try round the back.
Righty-o, sir.
Wait!
Sir?
Funny-looking eagle.
KNOCKING ON DOOR
DOOR OPENS Where is he?
Inspector, this is most improper!
Inspector?
Why exactly did you go to see Mr Worrall earlier?
I can't tell you.
You can't remember something that happened an hour ago?
No, I can't tell you.
I believe Father Brown's referring to the Seal of the Confessional, sir.
I don't care if he's referring to the walrus at Chester Zoo!
A man is dead!
Who?
Raymond Worrall, your eagle-bothering chum.
He was shot in the head from close range.
So you'll have to do better than "I can't tell you".
There was no weapon found with Mr Worrall's body.
The doors and windows were all locked, so whoever did it must've taken the gun and the key with them.
Where's that box?
What have we got here?
It's recently been fired.
As I told you, he...
The eagle, yes.
One shot fired.
I'll be honest, Padre, if it were anyone else, you'd already be in cuffs.
I'm guessing the R stands for Raymond?
I've never seen that letter before in my life.
I opened it, I read it and then I threw it away.
Is that right?
It sounds to me like you wanted Mr Worrall to keep his mouth shut about something.
Is that why you went to his cottage?
As I said, I...
I've had enough of this.
Father Brown, you're under arrest on suspicion of murder.
You're not obliged to say anything, but apparently you already know that.
Your lunch, Mrs Corven.
Not in the mood for chicken today.
Tell the cook to make me an omelette.
No, Mrs Corven.
I'd hate to waste them destroying you.
I have bigger fish to fry.
I'll go and ask Cook straight away.
I assure you, Raymond Worrall's death was none of my doing.
No need to bother collecting evidence, interviewing witnesses.
If you let me go, I can find out what happened.
And how are you planning to do that?
I have certain information.
What information?
I'm afraid...
Sorry, Padre, but if you want out of here, you're going to have to be a little more forthcoming.
How about I leave you alone to think about that?
Is the inspector in?
How could you be so stupid as to believe that Father Brown could murder anyone?
He can't even kill the slugs in his own garden!
Ladies, while I appreciate you coming here to tell me how to do my job, I have concrete evidence of Father Brown's involvement.
He had the murder weapon in his possession, for goodness' sake!
It wasn't him.
And you can't just fling him into a cell like a common criminal.
I think you'll find I can.
Can't we come to some arrangement?
I don't know what you're implying.
How about you let Father Brown go and I don't call my uncle at the Home Office and get you a new job directing traffic in Coventry?
Threats or no threats, Father Brown is staying put!
What's he done now?
Stole a bicycle from outside Mr Botham's cottage.
I thought it had been left out for scrap.
Put him in cell two.
An innocent misunderstanding...
There you go, ladies.
The Padre will have someone to keep him company.
Oh!
No need.
I'm sure it'll get ironed out.
I'll admit it, I'm surprised.
Not much shocks me, but this is a right old turn-up for the books.
We've retrieved a bullet from the body.
It matches the calibre of revolver that you had in your possession - a revolver that was recently fired.
We've searched the house, but there's no other weapon.
Furthermore, Mr Worrall was discovered in a locked house, but there's no other key was found on the body or during the search.
Then maybe the murderer took it with them?
My thoughts exactly.
And then there's this.
A letter from the victim, threatening to expose some grubby little secret.
So what did you do, Padre?
Get too friendly with one of your parishioners?
Embezzle money from the church?
My conscience is clear.
That won't help you in court.
You see, we have method, motive and opportunity here - the Holy Trinity.
So, for the last time, can you please explain what you were doing in Raymond Worrall's cottage?
I'll give you the night to think about it.
In the morning, either you tell me everything you know, or I charge you with murder.
DOOR OPENS
Any news?
If I had told him about the letter...
Why do you think he went down to that cottage?
He didn't say.
But he's been out of sorts ever since he came back from seeing that terrible Corven woman.
Raymond Worrall was her lover.
So, more than likely, she has something to do with it.
Well, I hate to put a dampener on things, but isn't Katherine Corven very much behind bars?
It's not like they'd let her nip out to shoot someone.
But what if she got someone else to do it for her?
Maybe a cellmate due for release or...
If only we could get in and talk to her.
Why can't we?
One can't simply saunter into a prison.
I don't see why not.
After all, my godfather is chairman of the Board of Governors.
Is there any institution in this country that is not run by one of your relatives?
Not that I can think of.
She's being held under the strictest conditions.
My godfather assured us...
Your godfather should know the rules.
Very well.
I will file a report which states that your prison breaches the 1948 Criminal Justice Act, section 23C.
Excuse me?
It states that every prisoner has the right to meet in private with a spiritual advisor or representatives thereof.
You are spiritual advisors?
Representatives thereof.
How is he?
He's in a prison cell, as I'm sure you know.
Excellent!
What did you say to him yesterday?
That's private, I'm afraid.
Oh, we'll find out one way or another.
No, you won't.
Only two of us know what was said, and Father Brown isn't allowed to tell.
His god won't let him.
Such a tragedy - destroyed by his own faith.
If you don't put an end to this, young lady...
You'll do what?
I'm being executed in a few days, thanks to our mutual friend.
What exactly have I left to lose?
We'll prove that Father Brown had nothing to do with Raymond's death.
I doubt it.
But I'd hate for your journey to be a complete waste, so would you pass on a message from me?
Tell Father Brown that I'll see him in hell.
Katherine must have recruited someone to murder Raymond and frame Father Brown.
All we have to do is find out who.
Follow my lead.
You survived, I see?
I'll show them out.
What do you mean?
You know exactly what I mean.
She told us everything.
She made a deal.
If you want to keep your job, you are going to tell us your side of the story.
And don't leave anything out.
Katherine found out about the affair.
Relationships between the officers is strictly forbidden.
And of course George is married.
So she blackmailed you?
All correspondence is supposed to go via the governor's office, but I'd sneak them out.
At first, they were just letters to her lover,
Raymond or whatever he's called.
I think Katherine was trying to get back into his affections.
Then they tailed off, and other notes were going back and forth.
Her?
What were these notes about?
I don't know.
He thinks you'd be more cooperative on an empty stomach.
It is much appreciated.
Look, Father, I know you wouldn't kill anybody and so does the inspector, he's just being too pig-headed to admit it.
Is there anything I can do to help?
That's very kind of you, Sergeant.
But I wouldn't want to get you into trouble.
And when has a bit of trouble ever stopped you from helping others?
Well, if you really want to help, perhaps you could tell me who it was who alerted the police to the gunshot at Raymond Worrall's cottage.
Said she was calling from the public telephone on Ridley Street, if that's any help?
Justice for Katherine Corven!
You!
Guilty conscience?
Why should I have?
One man is dead.
And another man is in a police cell for a crime he didn't commit.
And a woman is due to be hanged for defending herself against a husband's tyranny.
She killed her husband and now she's killed Raymond.
Or at least got someone else to do it for her.
You don't know what you're talking about.
She was trying to protect him.
But someone intended to hurt Raymond, and she asked me to watch the cottage that morning.
If anything happened, I was to call the police immediately.
So what did happen?
I heard a gunshot, so I ran to the nearest telephone box.
The one who lives in the old barn on Fletcher's Lane.
He was pushing his barrow towards Kembleford.
But what could he have against Mr Worrall?
Katherine warned me about him.
Said he's a corrupt, evil, selfish...
Father Brown is the best man I have ever met.
DISTANT VOICE
Are you there, Father?
Yes.
Do you believe in luck?
I believe in God.
Maybe that's what you want to call it.
I believe in Lady Luck.
To look at me, most people wouldn't think I'm a fortunate fellow, but I am.
I am free, see.
Even in here.
Take this morning.
I'd just finished my last bottle when fate provided.
DOOR OPENS
Lucky man, me!
# Now my song is over
# I've got no more to say
# Just give me an egg and brandy
♪ And I'll be on my way. ♪
I don't want to know.
Do we even have any idea what we are looking for?
Something to link him to Raymond, I suppose.
In all this rubbish?
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
Maybe you're right.
So you want me to arrest him for owning a photograph?
Katherine Corven recruited someone to kill Raymond and frame Father Brown.
Harry Slow was seen in the area at the time, and that photograph proves the connection between them.
And what connection is that?
Sorry, but one photograph does not a murder conviction make.
Any actual evidence?
No, but...
And thanks to you two, now I have earache as well!
Can't you at least bring Harry in for questioning?
We've only just let him go!
But unless he has an identical revolver, another key and the motive to use them, I fully intend to charge the Padre with murder.
Father Brown is no murderer!
How many criminals has he helped to put behind bars?
Yes, I've been thinking about that one.
It's hard to know what came first, the chicken or the egg.
Was the Padre corrupted by his exposure to so many murderers, or is his skill at catching killers just a symptom of his own homicidal instinct?
For goodness' sake!
Come on, this is useless.
Goodbye, Inspector.
Oh, and if finely-honed detective skills are a sign that somebody might be a violent maniac, I'm sure none of us has anything to fear from you.
Right, sir.
Sit yourself down.
Can't remember.
Look, we normally turn a blind eye to your "activities".
Mostly because whenever we bring you in,
Goodfellow has to hose down the cell afterwards.
But if you want to end up in prison, be my guest.
I was walking into town first thing yesterday, passing Frimley Copse, when I saw a man digging a hole.
What did he look like?
He was burying something.
Anyway, he clearly didn't want it, so I waited for him to go and then I dug it up.
Where is it now?
I sold it to the landlord of the Red Lion.
Paid off my tab and got a few bob left over to top myself up again.
Sergeant.
I'll go and see if the landlord's still got it, sir.
So the photograph was inside?
Never been my strong point, reading.
Why keep the picture?
Look at it.
I can dream, can't I?
DOOR OPENS
A man was seen burying it in the woods yesterday morning.
Judging from the initials, I'm guessing it was Raymond Worrall.
"death cannot part us.
"One day we shall be together again."
It sounds like they were still a couple.
Which is funny because Mrs McCarthy reckons this Corven woman is the one that wanted him dead.
So what changed to make Katherine want to have Raymond murdered?
Maybe he'd told her that he was planning to move away and she felt abandoned?
Sergeant!
What are you doing in here?
Just checking on the inmate, sir.
I heard a cry of pain.
I just wanted to make sure he wasn't doing himself a mischief.
I stubbed my toe.
We know you're guilty, don't we, Sergeant?
Seems that way, sir.
Is that it?
Yes, sir.
Get all this cleaned up.
And send that other troublemaker home, and tell him to lay off the sauce.
Right away, sir.
I might be able to prove my innocence, but only if I can get out of here.
The inspector will never allow it.
But...perhaps there's another way.
Did you get rid of that drunkard like I asked?
Good.
Sweet dreams, Padre.
SNORING
You can do what you like, but I am going to gather the congregation and we will maintain a vigil in front of that police station until Father Brown has been released!
They're not going to let him go because a bunch of octogenarians are sat outside with a flask of tea and cucumber sandwiches!
SHE MOUTHS
FOOTSTEPS
Nice to see you are both getting along so well during my absence.
Father!
So, Inspector Mallory finally saw sense?
No offence, Father, but if cleanliness is next to godliness, then don't expect any help from above.
What happened to your cassock?
But we need to get over to Raymond Worrall's cottage.
But the place is all locked up.
How do you intend to get in?
Present from Sergeant Goodfellow.
We need to be quick, before Inspector Mallory notices I'm missing.
Was that wise?
So, somebody shot Raymond Worrall, left with the gun, and then locked the door behind them.
That protestor?
Impossible.
Because she alerted the police after she heard the first shot, from the public telephone box in Kembleford.
She couldn't have got back here in time to kill him.
It could have been that prison officer.
I mean, what if she and Katherine had a deal that ran to more than just delivering a few letters?
She was on duty.
Maybe he killed Raymond in a jealous rage?
I don't think Blind 'Arry was capable.
And why would he help me escape from the police station if he was responsible?
Well, who, then?
You don't think Katherine Corven broke out of prison, shot Raymond and then broke back in again?
Hardly.
I think the answer will come from on high.
Father, aren't you a bit long in the tooth for this kind of caper?
I'll be fine.
Don't be so stubborn and hold my handbag.
Shall I come up as well?
No need.
Oh, do be careful, Penelope.
You say that like I've never clambered across a stranger's rooftop before.
I'm never sure if she says those things just to try and shock me.
What is it exactly that I am looking for?
CLATTER
I still don't understand.
Why did the murderer hide the gun up the chimney?
Why didn't he take it with him?
'He never left the house.
'The stone on the end of the cord acts as a counterweight.'
So, when Raymond let go of the gun, it disappeared up the chimney.
An old conjurer's trick, designed to put the police off the scent.
Raymond shot himself?
And framed me, because he believed that I sent his lover to the scaffold.
And the soot on his gardening gloves from the fire meant that no-one noticed any burn marks from the gun.
But question - how did you know that the gun was up the chimney?
An egg.
Jackdaws nest in chimneys.
'And when I found a jackdaw egg so close to the house,
'I knew that Raymond must have cleared his out.'
But why now, in this warm summer?
And this grate hasn't been used for months.
How on earth are you going to convince Mallory that that's what happened?
I'm not.
Sergeant!
Sir?
These letters - just a load of soppy nonsense.
Is the Padre awake yet?
I don't think so, sir.
Then wake him up and get him into the interview room.
Let's see if he'll finally start talking.
It might take a while, sir.
He's quite a deep sleeper.
Throw a bucket of water over him if you have to!
Yes, sir.
# And now my song is over
# I've got no more to say
♪ Give us my eggs and brandy And I'll be on my way. ♪
Is it time for bed yet?
Would somebody please put this man in a cell where he belongs!
Now what's he done?
We found him trying to steal the communion wine.
What an idiot.
I had to pop out, sir.
Where did you find those?
I had a hunch, sir.
You see, I think Raymond Worrall killed himself.
I'm sure you understand I was just doing my job.
Well, I'll leave you to it.
I hope it goes without saying that none of this ever happened.
If the inspector knew I went behind his back...
My lips are sealed.
And I've spoken to Harold and he won't be spilling the beans.
How much did that cost you?
A rather fine bottle of Scotch.
Sergeant, you are a good man.
Some of my strawberry scones.
Extra cream.
You didn't need to do that.
So, what now?
Hot meal, hot bath.
What's this?
That's a big mistake.
I assume you and your gentleman friend are still playing hide the truncheon?
You know I wouldn't hesitate to tell.
Tell whoever you like.
I've handed in my resignation and he's left his wife.
You may not have long left in this world, but I don't intend to be your slave for another second.
You don't want to be one of my enemies.
Things don't turn out so well for them.
A little bird told me that Father Brown has been released.
Turns out Raymond committed suicide.
SHE LAUGHS
This is very kind of you.
We know it was Katherine Corven, by the way.
And we also know that you can't speak about it.
Maybe you should go and see her and show her she's not nearly clever enough to get one over on the great Father Brown.
Have you ever heard the story of the eagle and the daw?
I can't say I have.
A jackdaw sees an eagle swoop down on a spring lamb, carrying it away to eat.
The jackdaw believes himself to be as powerful, so he flies over, lands on the back of another lamb, grips it with his claws and flaps away with all his might.
But he can't lift the lamb, and the shepherd sees him, catches him, clips his wings and gives him to his children as a pet in a cage.
Vanity is very dangerous.
But she tried to...
I have no desire to gloat.
I shall pray for the soul of Katherine Corven, and that she may finally seek forgiveness.
