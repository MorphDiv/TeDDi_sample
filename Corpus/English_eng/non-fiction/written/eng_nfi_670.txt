Previously on "Designated Survivor"...
I would like my daughter to see a woman
- become vice president.

The House Ethics Committee they are opening an investigation into the Speaker.
My dad was a great president.
Tyler, I am sorry for your incredible loss.
Lozano is alive, sir.
The man the FBI killed was a decoy.
Jay Whitaker, Homeland Security Adviser.
Lozano was a total soldier.
I'm just glad we caught the son of a bitch.
Me too.
We've known that someone in the White House made Kirkman designated survivor.
This person may still be active.
Hey, Jason.

What do you need?
Patrick Lloyd.
How'd it go?
Clockwork.
We're back on track.
I'm glad we had a chance to dig in on this.
Me, too.
If we can expedite TSA screenings without sacrificing security, it's money well-spent.
And the president is all about making people's lives easier.
Perhaps we can put this on his radar after the NATO summit?
In the meantime, you'll get me that data?
- Consider it done.

_
So, here's something I didn't know when I came to the White House.
George Washington ran America's first spy ring during the Revolutionary War.
His agents relayed British troop movements.
And they didn't even have cellphones.
He doesn't look very happy.
Well, you probably wouldn't want to smile either if you had wooden teeth.
- Mr. President!

I heard that we had some very special guests here in the White House today.
Including President Richmond's son.
Tyler, really good to see you again.
Same here, Mr. President.
Allow me to introduce the Student Orchestra of Robert Richmond High School in New Orleans.
It is an honor to meet all of you, and I heard a rumor that we're gonna get to hear you perform
- later this afternoon.

Can't wait to hear it.
And if there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to ask.
Yes?
Can I take a picture with you?
It would be my pleasure.
Come on.
Thank you for doing this, Mr. President.
Are you kidding?
With Leo and Penny up in Camp David, well, it's nice to have young people in the White House again.
It's great to see you sharing your passion for music with these students.
Oh, well, I can't take credit.
This group is actually part of a national program that funds the arts in public schools.
Oh, that's wonderful.
And, unfortunately, it, um, might all come to an end.
You see, when the funding was approved,
Congress put in a sunset clause, so the grant has to be renewed every five years.
- When's it expire?

Oh.
So, this might be the end of playing music for a lot of these kids, and, you know, most of their families can't afford private lessons.
Mine couldn't either.
I played trumpet in my elementary school band.
Oh, I didn't know you played.
Well, I wouldn't exactly call it playing.
In fact, it was pretty awful.
But it was the experience that mattered.
That...

Music shaped my whole life.
Leo's all about it, too.
But I have to admit,
I don't think I can get into dubstep.
Hey, you never know.
My dad introduced me to Brahms,
I got him hooked on Radiohead.
I promise you.

Thank you, sir.
I know this is small stuff compared to everything else you've got going on...
No, no, it's not small stuff.
I think every student in this country should have access to the arts for their education.
It'll be an honor to help.
- I'll see you at the concert?

I went through all of her files.
Most of them have to do with Browning Reed.
Maybe she's out in the field and had to go radio silent.
Yeah, maybe.
Look, you know,
I know Wells isn't exactly by-the-book, right?
But, if she working something, she would've let me know.
What about Jason Atwood?
I mean, she did bring him to North Dakota with her, right?
- Maybe... maybe he's talked to her.

He doesn't know anything.
Besides, Hannah told me she sidelined him anyway.
Where's she staying?
This is her.
Let's check her room.
Excuse me, ma'am?
Secret Service.
Would you open this door, please?
Anything?
No.
She's gone.
Let's check the security cameras.
Sorry.
Hey, eyes on the road!
Sorry, Hookstraten's Ethics Committee hearing's about to start.
Well, at least I know what the press is gonna ask me about in today's briefing.
Everybody loves an ethics scandal, especially given the V.P. rumors.
The V.P. rumors are just that, Seth.
- Rumors.

Things have a tricky way of becoming reality.
Let's just see how this hearing goes.
Hey!

Yeah, it looks good.
You didn't even notice.
I mean, it looks the same?
It always looks great.
What is... what?
I got it for the trip.
Wow, I didn't realize you were so excited
- for a NATO summit.

I figure I'll be taking a lot of pictures on Air Force One.
Oh.
Um, you've been on a...

Ooh, not this one.
Oh, my God.
What my colleagues and I are here to determine is whether or not there was any quid pro quo involved between your trip to Turkey and your subsequent co-sponsorship of the military aid bill to that country.
I appreciate your candor, Congresswoman, so I can categorically deny that there was any connection between the two events.
The trip was about agricultural methods.
Period.
Did anyone from the Turkish military or government contact you during your time in Turkey to discuss military aid of any nature?
No, they did not.
So, it's just a coincidence that everyone who went on that trip with you later voted in favor of the military aid package?
Congressman Saldua, 279 other members of Congress also supported that bill, sir.
And, by your question, you are not only impugning my integrity but also that of my colleagues who are no longer here to defend themselves.
That wasn't my intent, Madame Speaker.
If I may?
All of you are new to Congress, but one thing we have in common is the oath we took to uphold the Constitution.
I've always done my best to live up to that oath.
There may be little hard evidence here for you to investigate, but there is a lifetime of public service to consider.
And that's what's at stake here.
And that's also my best defense...
My record and my reputation.
When it comes time to vote...
I hope you will vote on that.
Of course they only have one working camera.
There's Wells.
The hell?
Damn it.
Mr. President.
You wanted to see me?
It's about Agent Wells, sir.
What about her?
She's been kidnapped.
Kidnapped?
- How?

Who?
- We don't know, sir.

- I want every agency on this.

What was she closing in on?
She was looking into Browning Reed...
A former military contractor.
Agent Wells is convinced that the ex-C.E.O. Patrick Lloyd's involved with the conspiracy.
Did she have any evidence?
Right now, it's just a working theory.
We don't have anything directly tying him to the bombing, yet...
No smoking gun.
But we've got eyes on him 24/7.
Lloyd lives in Virginia, but lately he's been traveling the country, building up his political profile.
This afternoon, he's speaking to an alt-right gathering downtown.
Use every resource available to you, but find Agent Wells.
- Yes, sir.

Some people still buy this stuff, huh?
What can I say?
Hipsters love analog.
I got a shotgun mic and receiver.
Range of 1,000 yards.
Hm?
The nano tracker inside...
Negligible weight difference.
Tracking radius of 10 miles.
Perfect.
So, what happened?
Bureau run out of toys?
Thank you for the quick turnaround.
I owe you.
Mr. President, I have something
I think you're going to want to hear.
It's about the NATO summit.
I'm all ears.
I just came from meeting the new French ambassador, and the first thing he wanted to talk about was nukes.
What about them?
Liberals in France have been railing against nuclear escalation for decades.
But now, even the conservatives are beginning to wonder why they're spending so much damn money just to maintain weapons in Europe.
Ambassador Bouvar broadly hinted that it's an opening to de-escalate, Tom.
Well, fine, but unless I'm missing something, if we reduce our arsenal, what stops our adversaries from taking advantage?
If the West could show Russia that we were serious about laying down our weapons, they might see that it's safe for them to start laying down theirs.
And if they don't?
Well, we'd do it incrementally.
And if there's no reciprocity, we stop.
But, it's a chance.
It's a chance I never got, Mr. President.
It would take more than France and the United States.
The entire alliance would have to be on-board.
Absolutely.
The details are all in here.
In the meantime, I will need permission to open any backdoor communication with the French and a few of our other NATO partners, and we'll have to act fast.
This time tomorrow, everyone'll be heading to Toronto for the summit.
Let's give it a shot.
Yes, sir.
Thank you both.
Trenton P.D. called in the plate 15 minutes ago.
- Empty?

It's not like they're gonna leave us any breadcrumbs.
- Well, it's better than her being in there.

But, if they didn't take her to kill her...
Then, what do they want with her?
Where's Lozano?
You tell him I want to talk to him!
I understand, sir.
The problem, though, isn't public support for the issue, it's the mining and utility companies that put up the biggest fight.
Clean water shouldn't even be a fight.
These companies that you're talking about need to start working for the future.
You know that business execs only think about bottom-line costs.
Well, if their only concern is costs, you should remind them how much it costs to clean up their mess, especially after we start fining them.
Yes, sir, Mr. President.
Thank you, Brian.
Thank you all.
Kimble, please.
So, how did the hearing go?
Honestly, I don't know.
I think I represented myself well.
Aaron thought I did.
But it's a hard room to read.
I'm sure you knocked it out of the park.
But, sir, even if the Ethics Committee finds no wrongdoing, the accusation will always be out there.
Kimble...
I said I would stand behind you.
- I meant it.

In the meantime,
I intend to keep doing my job.
The business of governing doesn't stop, even for an ethics inquiry.
Speaking of which,
I met with President Richmond's son Tyler this morning.
He was with a group of music students from a high school in New Orleans that had just been named after his father.
Now, he told me that their music program was gonna lose their funding.
How familiar are you with the federal art grants that make these kind of programs possible?
I remember that bill.
The sunset clause was added to get it past some of my more conservative colleagues.
How fast do you think we can get Congress to reauthorize the grant?
I wish I could help you and Tyler with this, sir, but it has to go through the Ways and Means Committee, which is chaired by Owen Saldua, who just happens to be leading the charge against me
- in the Ethics Committee.

Unfortunately, no.
I don't have any leverage with him right now.
But you might.
Saldua's an Independent.
He might just listen to you.
Okay, I'll reach out to him.
Thanks again, Mrs. Kirkman, for showing us around today.
No, no, please, call me Alex.
Uh, it was great, and it made me happy.
Those kids, they're so passionate about what they're doing, and they adore you.
Oh, well, I'm just lucky they let me hang around.
Oh, come on.
Don't sell yourself short.
I could tell you have a way with them.
Well, it's... it's been good for me, too.
How are you doing?
The kids are good... really.
Um, Camp David's been a change.
Not so much for Penny because, you know, she sees everything as an adventure... but Leo, I-I think he thinks we're punishing him.
Yeah.
Well, I know how hard it can be, you know, being a part of all this.
And you didn't even sign up for it.
Well, neither did you, but you seemed to cope really well.
Hm.
I-I guess it's...

I used to want my kids to have extraordinary lives.
And now I-I just...
I just want some semblance of ordinary, you know.
From, um, my experience, kids can bounce back from a lot.
What matters is, is that you stick together.
Right this way, Mr. Lloyd.

Okay.

Place all metal objects in the tray
- before stepping through the metal detector.

Um...
Uh, sir, your lapel pin.
- You're kidding, right?

- Okay.

Hi.
Oh, thank you.
Ah, thank you.
Easy like Sunday morning.
Just a little tip.
Thanks.
Want it?
Nah, you can keep it.
Thanks.
Congressman Saldua's here.
Congressman, welcome to the White House.
- Please.

I was hoping I might get an invitation soon, uh, though I am a bit wary about coming in today, given the circumstances.
I'm not here to meddle in any ongoing investigations, and I am very sorry that we haven't had the chance to meet yet.
I'm still trying to find my way around here, as I'm sure you are.
Every day, Mr. President.
But I'm convinced we can do some great work.
That's good to hear.
There's a lot of work to do.
Today, I was thinking about education.
I met some high school students from New Orleans...
Part of a music program funded by the National Endowment for the Arts.
But, unfortunately, their funding's about to run out.
Arts education is certainly something to look at as we approach the next budget.
These kids can't wait that long.
Their grant expires next month unless Congress re-approves it.
So, I was hoping that maybe we could find a way to fast-track it...
Tack it on to something else.
Respectfully, sir, I ran for Congress to avoid that kind of back-room dealing.
Respectfully, this isn't a back room.
This is the Oval Office of the White House.
These kind of riders have been part of the problem in Washington for decades.
I mean, you scratch my back, I scratch yours.
Congressman, this won't just affect high school students in New Orleans.
This is a national program.
- The ramifications...

But a lot of folks think we should throw everything we've got into science, technology, engineering, math.
We used to lead the world in those areas.
Now, we're barely in the middle of the pack.
I don't think our children should be forced to choose between art or science.
I'm happy to debate this, Mr. President, when we put together the next budget.
This is the year of our reckoning.
The rest of the world is catching up to what we've known...
That for far too long, government has tried to hijack our identities, control our lives, and brainwash our children.
But no longer.
No longer because we are rising up.
- Yeah!

This movement is the future of our nation, and no...

Dalton.
It's Foerstel.
How's Lloyd?
Just wrapping up his Beer Hall Putsch.
Inspiring.

Come on, man.

You're already shaking me down?
Well, what else are cousins for, right?
Come on, I'm not asking for any state secrets or anything like that.
I just want to know what your take was on how things went down this morning.
I know Congresswoman Yoshida was impressed.
Okay?
And Delacroix and Harmon, too.
What, that's it?
We didn't get more support than that?
I mean, they still have more witnesses to call.
So, you think it's gonna be a 9-3 against.
Yeah, all right.
I mean, I could be wrong.
I'll call you if I hear anything.
Thank you.
_
9 to 3 against?
It's an estimate, ma'am.
They still have other witnesses to call.
Yeah, bureaucrats who simply confirm the facts they already know.
I took a trip and there was a bill.
Well, the others can still change their minds.
I thought I did better than that.
No, you did fine, ma'am.
This is a kangaroo court.
They're going to strip me of my Speakership.
And they can't do that alone.
They can only recommend to the full House.
You can still fight this.
With what?
The facts won't change.
I gave it my best shot in there today with the committee.
What makes you think
I'll do any better in the House?
Because it'll give us time to organize a campaign.
We'll put your profile out there in the national media,
We'll drag it out as long as we can... until public opinion swings the vote in your direction.
You may have just given me an idea, Aaron.
For what?
A last hurrah.
Thank you for coming today.
Thank you.

Target on the way out.
On it.

We'll boil the message down to a handful of talking points, get those out to some key media outlets in anticipation of the summit, and then your speech in Toronto will build on those.
Less nationalism, more multinationalism.
Well, that's the gist of it.
And let's be specific about reducing military hot spots around the globe.
- Build awareness.

- I'll have a draft for you to read on the plane.

Sir, I, uh...

- Any luck?

Most of these new reps don't have any voting history to speak of, so we're feeling our way in the dark.
But I did request a list of every Congressional district
- with at least one school in the program.

That might make them think twice, knowing they're gonna have to face their constituents if they let the grant expire.
- Thank you.

I'm still working on it.
It really didn't matter what I said in that hearing, did it?
You know I can't discuss an ongoing ethics investigation, especially not with its subject.
I also know you want me out, Owen.
I believe the kind of politicking you represent should be a thing of the past.
I understand that's good for messaging, but what you don't realize about us old-school politicians is that we understand procedure.
If this goes to the House,
I could eat up the next six months at least with hearings and motions and subpoenas.
- Is that a threat?

Quite the opposite, actually.
I'm willing to get out of your way.
I'm sorry?
I want what's best for the country.
So, I'll step aside, resign the Speakership, and my seat.
I'll admit.
I'm surprised.
But I want something from you, Owen.
I want the public arts education funding reauthorized before I go.
The operation is still viable.
Right now, I'm brooming any connection between you, Browning Reed, and the Capitol mission.
Well, then, I want to know why two federal investigators were on my property.
Don't worry about it.

Soon, there'll be no paper trail whatsoever, and Agent Wells is contained.
Okay.
Well, what about the, uh...

Everything's on track with Abe Leonard.
He's eaten up everything I've fed him.
He thinks he's another Woodward and Bernstein.
Well, when are we going to see something from him, then?
Any day, I expect.
And you're sure that the FBI has no idea what's coming.
All the agencies are focused on the three targets from Brooke's hard drive...
The Golden Gate Bridge, the Hoover Dam, and the Statue of Liberty.
- We have operational control.

Jay... we are so close.
We might not have the Presidency, but you can be damn sure that, before long, we will have the country.
I've done a multi-agency document search for any files with the words
"White House" and "Browning Reed" in them.
All I've managed to find was this.
It's, like, five files.
- How's that possible?

Well, there's got to be a digital record.
Still poring through the database.
And it seems since the attack at the Capitol, references to Browning Reed have been systematically deleted.
Someone's covering their tracks.
If we find out who deleted these files...
We find our traitor.
I had a long talk with Tyler Richmond.
There was just this sadness about him, you know?
He didn't get to know his dad growing up...
All the politics and then the White House, and I felt like he's still chasing his father.
I so don't want that for our kids.
I don't want it either.
I know we're trying to protect them, but aren't they better off with us...
Both of us?
Not yet.
I'm...

Well, me too.
Tom...
Yes?
Sir, Speaker Hookstraten?
Just give me a second.
I'll let you get back to your work.
Alex...
No, we'll talk later.
Kimble, please, have a seat.
Did you speak with the committee?
Unofficially.
And I wanted to speak to you as soon as possible.
What is it?
I've decided to resign.
The Speakership?
And my seat.
What?
Kimble, that doesn't make any sense.
The Ethics Committee is going to vote against me, sir, recommend to the House that I be removed as Speaker.
You have friends in the House.
Not enough.
For better or worse,
I represent old politics to a new Congress.
And this is the new politics?
This is a purge.
I said I would fight till the end, and I can see now that this is it.
I came to Washington to serve, but I can't represent my constituents the way they deserve.
Kimble, please.
Tell me what I can do.
Nothing.
It's out of our hands.
But, I do have a little bit of good news, at least.
As my last act as Speaker, the House will refinance the arts education funding for Robert Richmond High and all the other public schools that depend on it.
How is that even possible?
Saldua said he'd never do it.
Well, every inmate gets a last meal.
I asked for a little bit of pork.
You know, you're the best ally
I could've ever hoped for in Washington, sir.
It's been an honor serving with you.
No.
I'm sorry?
I won't accept this.
I appreciate the gesture, Mr. President, but we can't take on Congress.
I'm thinking of taking on something else.
No, Mom, only the president gets to wave when he steps on Air Force One.
I don't get a shout-out.
This is not the Super Bowl.
I... hey, uh, I got to go.
Yes, I'm bringing warm clothing.
- Okay, I love you too, bye.

- Who's that?

Hey, did you know that they charge you for the food on Air Force One whether you actually eat it or not?
Yeah, well, did you know that complaining about the meals on Air Force One is the same thing as telling people you went to school outside of Boston?
- Cambridge is outside of Boston.

Look, I'm sure you'll ride on the plane soon enough, right?
Somebody's got to stay here to hold down the fort.
Oh, well, I hope you enjoy your in-flight pretzels because I will be the highest ranking person in the White House.
That's terrifying.
Tell me that you found her.
It's only a matter of time, sir.
We will find her.
But, there is a new development.
We think there's a way to identify the traitor through a computer trace.
It's gonna be pain-staking, but it will get results.
And in the meantime, sir, we need to discuss your trip tomorrow.
I don't think it's a good idea for you to leave the White House right now.
Mike, I understand your concerns, but I have to go.
I'm not pulling out.
Then I insist we increase your security even more.
Do whatever you think is necessary.
But, if we're this close to finding the traitor,
I want you here in Washington.
Sir, I...

We're spread way too thin as it is.
There's only four of us who know the full extent of this, and three of us are in this room.
Mr. President, your safety is still my primary directive.
Then you handpick my detail.
If you trust them, I trust them.
But, I want you here.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
I can't reach it.
Thank you.
I was starting to wonder if you'd stood me up.
Come here.
What is it?
Nothing.
Is it about what I said earlier?
No.

I just got a lot on my mind.
Come on, let's get ready.
Tom, I'm worried about you.
I can see it in your face...
The toll this job is taking on you.
I mean, I know you can't tell me everything, but you can tell me something.
If I can't help you, then what's the point of me even being here?
I asked someone to do something for me... something very dangerous... and it might cost them their life.
When I was in choir in high school, we were never invited to the White House.
Neither were we.
- You were in choir?

We never got invited anywhere, now that I think of it.
Are you sure you're up for this?
No, I want to be here.
- Tyler, how are you?

Mrs. Kirkman.
How are the kids?
Eh, they're a little nervous.
This isn't exactly their high school auditorium.
Oh, come on.

And they're gonna remember this forever.
I wanted to be the first to tell you.
Congress is gonna reauthorize the grant.
- You serious?

You should thank Kimble Hookstraten.
She's the one who made it happen.
Don't worry, Aaron.
It's not about Congressman Saldua anymore.
Ladies and gentlemen...
The President of the United States.
Thank you.
Thank you, please.
Thank you all for joining us.
I know that you did not come here today to listen to my voice, so I will make this as brief as possible.
The performance that you are about to hear will be given by the student choir and orchestra of the newly renamed Robert Richmond High School of New Orleans.
And with them today is Tyler Richmond...
A talented musician himself and a great advocate for education in the arts.
Earlier today,
Tyler reminded me that art is the lifeblood of society.
And as we strive to create a truly comprehensive education for every student in America,
I realize now more than ever that we need someone who is capable and passionate to lead the charge.
Now, I can't think of a better setting to announce my nominee for Secretary of Education than this.
So, it is with great pride that I introduce
Speaker Kimble Hookstraten.
Thank you, Mr. President.
It's been an honor to work with you in Congress.
And it will be my honor to fight beside you for the education of our children.
Future leaders in every field, this job is about our kids, and this afternoon is, too.
So, it is also my honor to welcome the student orchestra of Robert Richmond High School.
Wade in the water
Children
Wade in the water, children
- Wade, wade, wade

God's gonna trouble the water
Thank you.
Sir.
It's my first time on Air Force One.
Well, here, let me.
Oh, you don't have to do that, sir.
- No, no, I know how to work these things.

As a matter of fact, uh, you might as well just do it right.
Go on up those stairs.
- Here, Tom, take a...

Take a picture with Seth.
Seth, come on up here!
That's okay, sir.

- Why not?

This is, uh...
This is just a photo for my mom, sir.
It's not... not for Instagram or anything like that.
Wow.
You ready?
Hey!

Uh, can I wave?
- My mom would really like that.

Got it.
Come on aboard.
Thank you.

That's not food.
