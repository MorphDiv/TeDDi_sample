(CHEERING)
Hello, everybody!
Thank you so much.
Welcome to The Grand Tour, which this week comes to you from the shores of Loch Ness
Now...
Exactly.
Now, to most people around the world,
Scotland is just a bunch of scenery and Mel Gibson with some paint on his face.
But actually it's a bit more than that.
What we have here is a list of all the important things that were invented in America, OK?
This is what the Germans came up with.
Then we've got the English contribution.
And then let's have a look at what France did.
- And the pencil sharpener.
- Oh, and the pencil sharpener!
Now let's have a look at the list of things that were invented by Scottish people.
(CHEERING)
Percussion cap.
Why is the US Navy on there?
Not joking, that was actually invented by a Scottish person.
If you are from Mexico or France or Italy, you wake up in the morning, open the curtains, it's a lovely day, think, "I'll go to the beach."
In Scotland you open the curtains... it's damp and cold:
"I'll go to the shed and I'll invent something."
That's what's going on there.
I'm surprised, actually, the English, don't just say that those are British inventions.
Ah, yes, the Andy Murray syndrome.
(BOOING)
Let's be honest, this does happen a lot.
When he invented the telephone, he was a British genius!
Exactly the same sort of thing happens with sport.
Motor racing, Jackie Stewart.
Three times Formula 1 World Champion.
OK, he's British.
That's how it works!
This is how it works on this side of the pond.
This bit's Scotland, where we are now.
This bit's Wales, which is next to where I live.
If you're English and you become brilliant or do something brilliant, you remain English.
If you're Scottish or Welsh and you do something brilliant, the English decide that you are, in fact, British.
I tell you what, I love being in Scotland because everyone here speaks their mind.
There's no ambiguity.
The town of Larkhall in Scotland, their welcome sign, here we go.
(CHEERING)
This is Scotland.
It's not just words, either, it's actions.
Do you remember that terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport a couple of years ago?
He ran off and he didn't get very far because this happened.
(LAUGHTER)
And um...
Interestingly, there have been no terrorist attacks in Scotland since.
Just thinking about that for a second.
When he kicked him, he must have broken his foot on the other guy's pelvis.
When that terrorist woke up that morning, he must've thought, "Right,
"The worst thing that'll happen to me today is I'm gonna blow up."
It wasn't, though, was it?
Cos the only thing to explode was his knackers.
Because in tonight's car programme...
I urinate on an engine...
Richard wears an anorak... and James takes drugs.
But first, I want to talk about Fiat.
They're mostly known these days for the 500, which is a small retro hatchback.
But after an absence of more than a decade, they are back in the sports car game.
So I went down to the Eboladrome to check out what they've come up with.
Under the skin, though, the 124 is based on the thoroughly modern Mazda MX-5.
Fiat supply some important things like the engine and the body, but both cars are built on the same production line in Japan.
On the surface, that is no bad thing.
You're gonna sleep a lot better at night knowing that your Italian car was actually put together by the Japanese.
However, it does raise a question.
Is that a sports car in its own right, or just a Mazda with a different badge on?
Well, before we find out, let's look a bit more closely at the badge.
Because you'll notice it says Abarth.
Abarth are Fiat's go-to people when they want to light a fire under one of their cars.
Not light an actual fire, but give what's already there some extra zest and zing and fire.
For starters, Abarth has tuned the 1.4 litre turbo-charged engine, so that this, the hottest 124, is faster than any MX-5.
0- 60 takes 6.8 seconds.
And the top speed is 145mph.
But in a car like this that feels like 145 million.
Certainly bundles for me.
And it's not just performance where the 124 has the edge over its Japanese half-brother.
I have to admit, and this comes from someone who struggles to find fault with the MX-5, the 124 does sound better.
Abarth have given it something called the Record Monza exhaust system.
What it does is make a small car produce a big-car noise.
(ENGINE ROARS)
It's like a cat in a lion suit and that's exactly the sort of panto you want.
What I'm saying here is that this car does its own thing.
But on the next point, the 124 does take a bit of a body blow.
You see, there's a price to pay for all this Abarth-ness.
And that price is £30,000.
£5,000 more than the top MX-5.
That said, the 124 does give you more under the skin, most notably in the handling department.
The thing is, Abarth have given this car a limited-slip diff... which makes sliding something you command.
(TYRES SCREECH)
The MX-5 doesn't have that.
Neither does it have this sport button here, which relaxes the stability control.
Quite a lot.
So, what we have here is a car that's fast, sounds good and is great fun in the corners.
But there's something else very important about the 124.
I don't know that there's really a million miles of difference between this and the MX-5.
But everything I do in this car I'm doing in an Italian sports car.
And it is impossible for that not to put you in a good mood.
It does feel so good to be in a small, Italian roadster again.
It's about time.
Everything about this little Fiat is designed to stir the emotions.
And make you smile like a child.
Right down to the retro black bonnet.
God, I love a black bonnet!
It's just... a black bonnet.
I really like the MX-5.
But the 124 has taken those Japanese foundations and added some Italian showmanship.
That's why I'd have it over the Mazda.
I don't just like it, I love it.
(CHEERING)
It's interesting that, because... ..as you know, I'm a sucker for an Italian sports car.
Love 'em to bits especially the Alfa.
However, I've driven an ordinary, cooking Fiat 124 and that is not as good as an MX-5, not even close.
Unless you want the fastest MX-5, in which case buy the Abarth.
That, of course, means handing it over to a man who thinks that beards were invented by Lenin.
There he is, poised and ready.
And he's off.
With a skitter of wheelspin and a fruity noise from the exhaust.
Straight onto a soaking-wet Isn't Strait.
What the hell... has happened in my life... that I'm over here driving a Fiat... in the wet in England?
He may not be enjoying it but he is very good at it.
As he carves the 124 through the standing water, making the best use of its 170 horsepower.
Really leaning on it as he approaches Your Name Here.
That is ballsy.
Now, heavy on the brakes, swoops round this fast left-hander, and exits with a skilful flurry of stylish over-steer.
Back onto the Isn't.
Hell, I don't know whether to drive this thing or use it for a spit-cup.
Charming!
Nerds will note these conditions would be better suited to a Barchetta.
If you like this car,
I bet you got a lot of fancy cushions in your house.
Yeah, cos as we know, cushions are, of course, Communist.
Right, into the tight complex of Old Lady's House.
Keeping it nice and tidy through there.
And now full power for the lumpy, bumpy sprint down to Substation.
Front hazards coming on under hard braking.
All Fiats do that for some reason.
Armful of opposite lock into Field Of Sheep.
More exuberance through there and across the line.
(CHEERING)
(LOW CHATTER)
It was a ballsy entry into Your Name Here, that was.
Anyway... we must now find out where it ends up on the board.
Let's have a look.
So you've recommended what is officially the slowest car in the world.
(MELLOW JAZZ)
(LAUGHTER)
Just to be absolutely clear with you, that really, really hurt.
Why is it that we have leather seats in cars?
Because in reality it's a terrible material.
It's too shiny and slippery.
I think it's cos we got hung up on the idea that leather is somehow posh on a car seat.
But it didn't use to be like that.
In the old days, the posh people sat in the back of the car on cloth seats, and it was the chauffeur sitting at the front... they gave him leather because it's hard-wearing.
I've got a picture here of an old car.
They didn't even extend the roof to cover him!
Another three feet would have done it.
I think that's deliberate.
I think that's to remind him that he's scum!
What would you two like to have instead of leather?
There's all sorts of things you could use.
You could have cable-knit wool.
Or, how's this for an idea?
Let me just throw it out there.
Why not take a cow, turn the middle of it into burgers and steaks, and then, instead of throwing the skin away, use it to cover the seats of your car?
Because it's a terrible material and it doesn't work.
That's only because you two have decided to be vegetarians.
Well, no, hang on...
They woke up together one morning and went,
"Let's not eat meat any more."
We didn't wake up together one morning.
Mysteriously arrived at the same conclusion pretty much the same day.
Anyway, we still eat chicken.
Scientifically, chicken is a vegetable.
If you cut a chicken's head off it still runs around.
There you go.
Thereby proving it's not a sentient being, it's a higher-order vegetable.
Scientifically.
Wouldn't a chicken-skin seat look like a giant scrotum?
Yes, and that's your fault for not eating meat.
So now let's move on, shall we?
What about that car makes it for women?
Well, they said it had a smaller-than-usual steering wheel
Also, you can drive it standing up, which is what women did in the 1920s.
This sort of thing is still going on today because I've got news of one here.
A car that's been launched called the Seat Mii Cosmopolitan.
"I've got a Mii-iii."
It's been done in collaboration with Cosmopolitan magazine.
"It's aimed at Cosmo Girl," it says.
And, are you ready?
"The headlights have an eyeliner shape."
Oh, yeah, cos...
I much prefer a car that's hard to park because I'm a man.
This gender-splitting of cars is ridiculous.
It's like saying a woman's airline seat or a woman's matches or a woman's anything.
"Can I buy a box of women's pencils, please?"
I said that out...
I left in a hurry.
Honestly, I just can't understand why people think there's such a thing
It's not as if you drive cars with your old chap or your magic triangle.
And there's um...
But a few years ago, Volvo did a concept car, and they boasted very loudly that the whole thing had been designed entirely by women.
And I've got a picture of it.
It's a coupe with gull-wing doors and a massive engine.
It's what everyone would do.
You know Tesla?
Tesla believes it's pioneering the electric car.
It's called The Scamp.
It had a top speed of 35mph, a range of 20 miles.
And I want to make it absolutely plain, that's Scottish, not British.
(APPLAUSE)
We can end the conversation.
Now, all over the world, people, by and large, buy very boring cars.
I met a man yesterday who'd just spent £8,000 on a five-year-old Ford Focus.
I thought, "Why did you do that?
If you've got £8,000 to spend, why didn't you buy a used Maserati?"
I think it's because people believe if you buy the used, exotic Italian car for £8,000 it's going to break down all the time.
Yes, and then we decided that cars this glamorous and this exciting couldn't possibly be tested in Britain.
So we decided to meet up in continental Europe.
This is the race track we selected.
It's just 60 miles from Calais, and I arrived bright and early.
(DOOR CREAKING)
This... is a Maserati Biturbo.
First car in the world to be fitted with two turbo chargers.
And this particular example is the sought-after S model.
And it's only done 24,000 miles.
And yet despite that, all I paid for it was £7,950.
So you get all this glamour, all this power, all that badge for less than you'd pay in the UK for a six-year-old Toyota "Pious".
Why has Richard Hammond arrived in a Ford Cortina?
This isn't a Biturbo.
Hammond.
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.
They just changed the name badge on the back.
These are the same car.
Yours is very ugly, but it's the same car.
I dispute that.
This is not ugly, this is elegant.
You wanna hear this baby fire up.
(ENGINE WHINES AND SCREAMS)
Feel the power of that!
Have you seen all this... there's no other word for it... oil?
Yeah, that...
Happily, before any more could flood out,
James arrived.
Have you ever seen a more ungainly-looking machine?
Behold... the Maserati Zagato Spyder.
All Biturbos.
I think this was designed when it was owned by Citroen, which was bankrupt at the time.
Then there was some guy in America who had a bit of Maserati.
And then the Italian Government, or Fiat, they all sort of had bits of it.
It was exactly the same, it just had a new name.
Oh, you've got two-tone leather.
But why have you got an automatic?
I've bust my arm.
That's why it took a long time to get out.
Have you really broken your arm?
Which arm have you broken?
(JEREMY LAUGHS)
It has made me murderously bad-tempered and intolerant of your fatuousness.
Have you seriously broken your arm?
It's fractured quite badly.
Can you put the roof back up for me?
We decided first of all to have a drag race, between our cars and a similarly-priced modern car... the Suzuki "Celery".
Tense moment.
(TYRES SQUEAL)
Sadly, however, the pit straight was too narrow for our four cars.
What are you doing?
Hammond, you idiot!
So, for the second attempt...
I volunteered to go down the pit lane.
Yes, this is genius!
And that didn't work, either.
What the hell?
Oh, shit!
Oh, my God!
Arg!
Why the hell can't we just do a drag race properly?
It can't be that difficult.
After this latest accident, we decided that, as Hammond's car had the biggest engine... he'd represent Maserati's honour on his own.
I like that.
Massive amount of bleeping about...
But then...
Finally, it spools up, turbos whizzing away.
(LAUGHS)
Yep, they were right to pick me.
Now you've established that, as a team, our twin turbo-charged Maseratis are faster than a 67-horsepower "Celery", let's get rid of the little Japanese car and find out which of our three cars is the fastest round the track.
We'll be driving Maseratis on a race track in continental Europe.
Sounds good, doesn't it?
I've broken my arm.
If we're gonna drive round a track, can I at least have one of those disabled knob things?
Yeah, like a forklift truck has.
Sounds fair enough.
So, whilst our colleague enjoyed his special breakfast,
Richard and I attached his steering knob.
There you go.
And then we hit the track.
The roots of this car, they were planted during the 1957 German Grand Prix.
Fangio, at the wheel of his Maserati 250F, overcame a 48-second deficit in 22 laps to win the race.
He smashed the lap record ten times.
You don't lose a pedigree like that.
Or the front go.
Flying laps in a Maserati.
This is exactly what Stirling Moss did.
Meanwhile, in the convertible,
James was very unhappy with his new steering knob.
Oh, God, it's the left-hander.
Bend the knob.
What is the matter with those two?
Despite my lucky-dip handling,
I did eventually catch Hammond.
Yes!
Yes!
No!
(CHUCKLES)
Arg!
He's going surely now!
Jesus!
Oh, shit.
Mr Clarkson is indisposed briefly.
No, no, no!
Come on!
So, having learned absolutely nothing at all... we decided to abandon the race track and embark on a 700-mile cruise to the south of France.
James was very pleased with this plan.
This is more like it, isn't it?
Not mucking around on a race track, which is always a bad idea in old cars.
We're going on a proper road trip to a lovely part of the world in very, very evocative, exotic cars...
Maserati!
In the 1970s, Maserati was naming all its cars after... exotic-sounding warm winds:
Mistral, Khamsin, Bora.
When I was a kid growing up in Doncaster,
I just thought,
"I've no idea what a Mistral is but I want one!"
It just sounds right.
However, fairly soon, reality began to stick its unwelcome nose into the equation.
You get no heat in here and I can't de-mist at all.
The brakes.
It brakes one wheel very well.
James, are my lights dazzling you?
(RATTLING)
You hear that rattling?
That's the steering wheel.
On top of the mechanical issues, there was the problem of James tackling the toll booths in his right-hand-drive car.
(GROANS)
(GROANS)
(GROANS)
We've got 700 miles to go.
It's going to take us for ever at this speed.
Jeremy, there are sparks coming from under your car.
I think you probably need to stop.
So, at the next petrol stop, with James failing to appreciate a present we'd bought for him...
You used to have a good sense of humour.
I do have a good sense of humour when you're being funny.
South of France is a long way away.
So why don't we go to the north of France instead?
And there's much more to see and do in the north than there is in the south of France.
What is there to see and do in the north of France?
Well, there's the immigrant camp in Calais.
There's that square where they set fire to a woman.
Yes.
(CHEERING)
We'll pick that up later on, but now it's time to play Celebrity Brain Crash!
(CHEERING)
OK, now what can we say about our guest this week?
He's Scottish, but he won a gold medal at the Olympics.
So of course he's British.
(LAUGHTER)
He started out in cycling, then very wisely took up motor racing.
He actually competed at Le Mans.
But today he's in a boat.
Ladies and gentlemen, Sir Chris Hoy!
(CHEERING)
There he is!
There he is.
He's gonna be all right.
He's rowing it the wrong way round.
The great thing is, everyone, the great thing is... that Loch Ness is a peaceful, inland lake with no hazards at all.
We may finally get a guest to the studio.
(APPLAUSE)
Ladies and gentlemen... you've just applauded the tragic death of Sir Hoy.
Um...
And there was a terrific explosion, you may have seen it.
And he's now...
Well, he's gone, hasn't he?
Does that mean he's not coming on, then?
Well, James, he's exploded and been reduced to chops and offal.
So that is a no.
You know voice activation systems in cars?
They don't really work, particularly they don't work in Scotland.
As we shall now demonstrate with a short clip of a man trying to pair his telephone with his Vauxhall.
Pair.
You can say "pair".
I just (BLEEP) said pair!
or cancel.
Pair!
For feedback, help or cancel... (EXAGGERATED) Pa-a-a-ir.
Pardon.
What I really love about this guy is how long he perseveres for.
Watch this.
Pa-a-a-a-ir.
Do you want to add or delete a device?
Add a device.
Using the pair function and the external device...
Yah!
This is a system that is cheap, works anywhere in the world, and you can fit it to any car, no matter how old it is.
Engage wipers.
It's just a man!
It's Gavril from Bulgaria.
Now, he picks up the phone, he does all the dialling.
My hands are on the wheel, I'm safe.
He holds it next to my ear so it's hands-free.
End call!
All right, then.
Punch driver.
He locks the doors.
And then he opens them when I get back so I don't have to have any keys with me, which would spoil the line of my jean trouser.
Let me just re-cap this, OK.
So in Whitby you turned a Romanian man
You turned me into a parking sensor.
And now you've turned a Bulgarian man into a voice-control system.
You know, in a modern BMW 7 Series, you have back seats that massage you
I have scooped out the middle of that back seat, OK?
And then you can fit it with a Dwan Fen.
I don't know why people are laughing at this.
She now blends perfectly with the seat, OK?
She is the seat.
Ooh!
James, James... he's sitting on a Thai woman now.
We'll go back to the Maserati film.
Now, so far we have established that I've broken my arm, but that the cars are working really rather well.
This is the man who married a sex kitten, just as she turned into a cat.
This is the man who moved into gold, just as the clever money moved out.
This is the man who drives a Maserati.
(ENGINE FAILS TO START)
(ENGINE FAILS TO START)
Start, you vicious bastard!
Of course, being a Maserati, it did eventually begin.
So we then fitted James's wheel with a new knob... and decided to go and play on the beach.
Ha-ha!
You really would have trouble doing this on a beach in the south of France because the whole thing would be covered in people turning their plastic surgery brown.
Ow-ow-ow-ow, ow-ow-ow-ow, ow-ow-ow-ow-ow.
In the sea!
Whoa!
You can take a Maserati in the sea... because the rust-proofing is so good.
After that, we enjoyed a picturesque walk and a philosophical debate.
And then we played some sport.
Penalty shoot-out in Maseratis on a beach in northern France.
(POP)
With our ball gone, we continued on our tour of Normandy, with our badly-built colleague moaning constantly.
(JAMES GROANS)
Has he been swapped for an old lady?
He was born an old lady!
As darkness fell, we reached the ancient town of Honfleur, where we decided to spend the night.
Unfortunately, to reach our hotel, we had to navigate through a maze of tiny, medieval streets.
No.
How did people manage in this town in the olden days when nobody had power steering?
Oh, no.
I do that how?
I'm totally stuck.
God almighty.
I'm not sure that's possible.
You're in the way.
It's a one-way street my way.
It's a one-way street, yes.
That's why me and the other cars are all coming this way.
Please don't make me back up with this steering.
Come on, it's a workout.
Hammond, I am gonna kill you.
Mon ami...
Il a conduit-ay son voiture comme la gorilla.
With Jeremy out of the way, I could move on.
But then...
You're going to have to reverse up there, aren't you?
I can't back up because it's preposterously narrow and I can't swivel my head round to look behind me.
So now what?
Well, I'm going the right way down the one-way street, so I have right of way.
Urgh!
Sorry, Hammond, you'll have to direct me a bit.
Hold it there and I'll go left.
Your left or my left?
Your right, my left as I'm looking.
And your right as you're looking, i.e. your right.
Your left is still my right.
I'm going to the hotel now but I'll leave this on so you can stay in tune with what they're doing.
It's been just a tremendous journey.
We've had three Maseratis out here for three days and we've only had one minor fire.
Can I just say, and I'm being absolutely honest here,
I love my Maserati.
I really like mine.
No car makes a better noise.
No two-litre car makes a better noise than that.
I love it more now than when I started.
I definitely want to keep mine.
I want to know what it's like to drive with two arms.
Because we all loved our cars so much,
I decided we should end our road trip with a spicy climax.
Why don't we race back to England, OK?
It's not entirely fair on me, is it?
You chose to come equipped with one arm.
It's your issue, not ours.
So we set off from here, all at the same time.
As dawn broke, we lined up outside the hotel, ready for the off.
Let's do this.
(JEREMY'S ENGINE FAILS TO START)
(HORN TOOTS)
(ENGINE FINALLY STARTS THEN STALLS)
Blast!
At all costs, I am winning this.
- (GROANS) - (FROG SQUEAKS)
They wait until you really need them, and then they go wrong.
"Yes, I'm on my way in my Maserati."
(CROAKS)
Some of this is familiar, which is bad.
Oh, no, not lost now.
So, straight out of town.
With a top speed of about 12,
I was headed for the ferry port of Le Havre.
The trouble is that logically, the others would be doing the same thing.
Car, clear your throat, please.
I'm out!
Right, England, here I come.
Or we shall be last.
And then I shall have to sell you, and not to someone nice.
You know that man who has sex with his cars and then puts pictures of it on the internet?
No, no, no, no!
Yet he seemed strangely unconcerned about this.
On the face of it, viewers, this isn't much of a race, because I've got the slowest car, we know that.
I only have the use of one arm and I'm steering with a squeaky frog bolted to the wheel.
However, it's not that simple.
I believe I will be first.
Because he who is last shall be first.
As we know.
Coming up now to the motorway.
(EXHAUST SPLUTTERS)
It's made it up the slip road.
Have you ever known a car with more spirit than this magnificent Maserati?
However, the gradient on the slip road was nothing compared to what lay ahead.
Oh, my giddy aunt.
Port, where is it?
If I get there first, I've got to wait for the ferry.
They could catch up, but I'll be ahead in the queue.
Whoever gets on the boat first gets off the boat first, and you can't change that.
First on the boat is first off the boat.
They win.
(EXHAUST SPLUTTERS)
Right, calm, Jeremy, calm.
You're on a motorway.
On an enormous bridge, surrounded by many heavy lorries.
(EXHAUST SPLUTTERS)
I can hear the exhaust spluttering.
Mercifully, I reach the top of the bridge.
But then... (SPLUTTERS AND STALLS)
It's dead.
I've lost all brakes.
There was only one thing for it.
I have no brakes!
You've just hit our car!
I haven't got any brakes!
They're not pleased about being used as a brake.
This is totally illegal, by the way, on a French motorway.
Right, so I've no brakes and no engine.
Think, Jeremy, think.
Unaware of Jeremy's problems,
I was keeping the hammer down.
Holiday-makers!
I hate holiday-makers!
(HORN BLARES)
Trucks.
I'm going to get caught up with all the trucks.
Meanwhile, back in the land of Captain Cryptic... (JAMES HUMS TO HIMSELF)
Do you know, I'm so relaxed about this,
I think, in a short while,
I might stop for a pleasant coffee and a read of the newspaper.
It's like I'm in the middle of bloody town.
I need to find my own route.
There must be sneaky ways through.
Down there.
Oh!
Dead end.
My shortcut wasn't going well.
Where are they and more importantly where am I?
It's just costing time.
And, as it turned out, time was something I didn't have.
I am now down to one turbo charger, but I'm back in the race.
Yes, I'm at the wheel of a Renault DCI 120 tow truck.
And what's more, I've decided to head for the port as the crow flies.
Oh, yes!
Oh, God, no!
This looks good.
This is all correct.
That is Jeremy!
There's Hammond!
What is he doing?
Kill him!
The problem was that the port of Le Havre is so vast and so complex, it was very easy to get lost.
This was still anyone's race.
Where is the boat?
Come on, come on, come on.

It's got to be down here.
Yes!
Did I have some carpet stuck under the throttle?
Cos my DCI 120's going like a bastard!
No, he is not!
He is not.
Yes!
Last night, after the other two had gone to bed,
I arranged for our company yacht to be waiting for me in the harbour.
And there it is!
I simply drive up, hop aboard, and then we'll be on our way.

I need to ask you about this.
Why did you stick "Deshabille" on my car?
Because you were disabled.
Déshabillé means undressed, you moron!
Let's not get bogged down with "Ooh, can't speak French."
Let's get to the point which is, James May, you lost and you broke the company yacht.
My car got closer to England than yours did.
Yes, but the other thing it got closest to was the bottom of the sea.
All of that is irrelevant because my car was the best, cos it didn't go wrong at all.
Mine was perfectly reliable.
And the extraordinary thing is, no-one can work out what was wrong with it.
It fell off the back of a lorry.
No-one can work out what fault it had that caused it to be on the lorry in the first place.
And even nine months down the line, two trained Maserati mechanics are totally stumped.
It is an unfathomable fault.
Yeah, so what we can conclude from our exhaustive testing in the north of France is that if you buy a used Maserati, you have a 66% chance of it working.
They're not bad odds.
You wouldn't say that if you were having an eye operation.
