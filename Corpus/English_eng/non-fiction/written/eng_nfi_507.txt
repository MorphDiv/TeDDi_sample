Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...
How was your trip?
I was in Mexico to coordinate a trade delegation.
Something wrong?
You don't need to worry about this.
We've got good men working on it.
Don't you ever touch me like that, when she's there.
I didn't mind it.

Your time is running out here.
I was thinking maybe we could try another way.
I couldn't say no when Mrs. Waterford asked me.
I'm sorry.
We only wanted to make the world better.
Now you have respect.
You can fulfill your biological destinies in peace.
Biological destiny?
Children.

Love.
Once.
Actually, twice for him.
Two times for me.
Almost three.
So close.
It doesn't matter.
It can never happen again.
Sorry, Nick.
Spick and span, girls.

Why do we have to do this?
It's fun.
Look, it's like painting.
They just want everything to look pretty and perfect.
There are people visiting.
Foreigners.
Tourists?
That's kind of messed up.
No, like government people, diplomats.
They'll be at your house tonight.
How do you know that?
My Commander.
Small dick, big mouth.
It looks kind of weird without all the dead bodies, doesn't it?
Yeah.
I guess you get used to things being one way.
Hurry up in there.
Coming.
I left a clean dress for you.
Thanks.
As soon as you're dressed, Mrs. Waterford wants to see you.
In her room.
Awesome.
I'll keep a good thought.
Mrs. Waterford?
All cleaned up?
Yes, Mrs. Waterford.
Good.
Now, we have some important guests tonight, a trade delegation from Mexico.
The Commander worked very hard to arrange this visit.
We need to make the right impression.
So, let's see you.
Turn around.
You're fine.

Red's my color.
Well, that's lucky.
Our visitors may have some questions.
They're curious about our lives here.
I know that if spoken to, you'll speak wisely.
I'll try to speak wisely, Mrs. Waterford.
Please don't disappoint me.
Do you understand?

You can go.
- You took your time.

I left as early as I could.
That's good, 'cause I have a conference call at 4:00.
You know...

I'm not your boy toy.

Let us pray.
Maybe some flowers.
You could write me a poem.
It doesn't have to rhyme.
And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof.
Hmm.

And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
My bones, flesh of my flesh, she shall be called Woman, because she was...
Therefore, shall a man...
Unto his wife.
They were naked, the man and the wife, and they were not ashamed.
May God bless this union...
And make it fruitful.
Amen.
They're through security.

You look very handsome.
Thank you.
They're having dinner at the home of a very powerful Commander.
Let them be nervous.
Blessed be the fruit.
May the Lord open.
How's your day going?
You look pretty.
Thanks.
I wore it just for you.
You shouldn't wear anything for me.
Nick?

Deputy Ambassador Castillo, puedo presentar our Handmaid, Offred.
May the Lord open.
No, Mrs. Castillo is the Ambassador.
Mr. Flores is her assistant.
I'm sorry.
No apologies are necessary.
It is a pleasure to meet you.
May the Lord open.
We've heard a bit about Handmaids, but it's difficult to separate rumors from facts.
That is why I'm so pleased we're opening a dialog between our countries.
Offred, what is your given name?
From before.
I don't use that anymore.
Handmaids take patronymics, derived from the head of their household.
Ofwarren, Offred, et cetera.
It's a symbol of their sacred position.
Yes.

Did you choose to be a Handmaid?
Yes.
Well.
It's an enormous sacrifice, what you're doing.
Handmaids are having children for the entire nation.
Offred knows how grateful we are for her choice in this.
Come.
Sir.
Pardon the interruption.
Ambassador, gentlemen, please join us for some hors d'oeuvres.
Thank you, dear.
Shall we make our way, then?
Please, after you.
A pleasure to meet you, Offred.
Blessed be the fruit.
Under His eye.
Thank you for your time and your thoughts.
You're welcome.
Might, may I ask, and I apologize if this is too personal, but you have chosen such a difficult life.
Are you happy?
I have found happiness, yes.
I'm very glad, Offred.
Ambassador.
I'm so pleased and honored you've traveled so far to be with us.
Por favor.
Everything looks delicious.

We've transitioned to a completely organic agricultural model.
Impressive.
How is the harvest in your country?
Ah, we have challenges, like the rest of the world.
Most of our staples are not adjusting to the new weather patterns.
Our citrus orchards in Florida are doing really well.
Rita, could you check and see if we have any oranges?
Yes, sir.
I believe we do.

I hope we'll find other valuable resources to share with you as well.
God has blessed our new nation...
Thank you...

Yes.
I'm curious.

How does the quiet half of the room feel about Gilead?
It's absolutely wonderful.
Mrs. Waterford?
I am blessed to have a home and a husband to care for and follow.
Traditional values are at the core of everything we do here, including trade policy.
"Never mistake a woman's meekness for weakness."
Clever.
Yes, it is.
It's from A Woman's Place.
My wife's book.
I reread it on the plane.
Such a thoughtful argument for domestic feminism, as it was called.
Thank you.

I heard you speak once at a rally, before the war, you were very passionate.
Women were abandoning their families and we needed to make a change.
We were running out of time.
You were arrested for inciting to riot, if I recall?
I had a temper in those days.
Back then, did you ever imagine a society like this?
A society that has reduced its carbon emissions by 78% in three years?
A society in which women can no longer read your book.
Or anything else.
No.
I didn't.
God asks for sacrifices, Mrs. Castillo.
That has always been His way, but He gives the righteous blessings in return.
And I think that it's safe to say
Gilead has been blessed in so many ways.
Amen.
Shall we have dinner?
We shouldn't have invited the wives.
It was a dinner at home.
Consider the optics.
If we don't make progress on trade, in six months our currency will fall off a cliff.
Consider that.
Recounting your arrest record doesn't do anything to help that problem.
You have meetings tomorrow.
You can talk about the issues, and then we have the reception afterwards.
Waste of time.
I disagree.
Let's go over the details.
I'm sure you'll make it all look perfect.
Hi.
Hi.
You look tired.
We met until 3:00 a. m.
Colby and Harris had to take the train in.
They're still being followed.
FBI?
I don't know.

Well, if they made it and you had the full committee, what happened?
Nothing happened because all these men know how to do is talk.
I honestly don't know if they have the faith to see this through.
Hey, hey.
Come here.
We're going out.
No.
I have calls to make, and I just wanna go to sleep.
I wasn't asking.
Thanks.
Thank you.
You sure this is big enough?
There is no problem that cannot be solved with enough movie popcorn.
Did you make your proposal to the committee?
Yes, if it did any good.

What about you?

Did you turn in your article?
No, I'm still working on it.
But, you know, I was thinking, fertility as a national resource, reproduction as a moral imperative.
I think that's a really interesting idea and it could make for a great second book.
Or not.

You should.
It's a great idea.
Okay.

Hold this.
What?
It's happening.
They issued the orders.
It's what we proposed.
Three separate attacks.
When?
Three weeks.
Congress first, then the White House, then the Court.
Praise be.
Things have to change.
I know.
There's still going to be a lot of pain.
There's pain now.

We're saving them.
We're doing God's work.
Hey.
Hey.
He, uh...

Okay.
It only makes it worse.
Did you see the way she looked at us?
Like we were fucking freaks.
Who are they to judge us?
Half their population is malnourished.
They've had four elections in three years.
What are they doing to save the planet?

Not a single thing.
Can't they see the good work we're doing here?
Am I boring you?
No.

Being in here is a privilege.
I know that.
Time to go.
I'm sorry.
Can I...
Can I stay here with you?
Please?
You want to stay?
Come.
Here.
Kiss me.
Not like that.
Like you mean it.
Sweet girl.
Big day tomorrow.

All right, girls.
When we are inside, there will be no wandering about.
You will stay at your own tables.
We have tables?
Tonight you are guests, just like everyone else.
This is not an excuse to misbehave.
Girls, don't you all look beautiful.
Mmm‚Äêhmm.
Line them up, please.
Now, Aunt, if you would.
All right, girls.

Neat as you please.
Very nice.
Lovely.
Please remove the damaged ones.
Mrs. Waterford, ma'am.
Whatever punishment these girls had to endure was for the greater good.
They deserve to be honored just like everyone else.
And we do honor them.
But you don't put the bruised apples at the top of the crate, do you?
No.
Quietly, please.
All right.
Come forward.

Ofthomas, Ofjohn, Oftim.
Ofwarren, you too.

Take them to the van.
No.
No, I want to go to the party.
- Ofwarren.

No!

No, get off of me!
No, I didn't...

I didn't do anything wrong.
I know.
I just wanna go to the party.
Ofwarren.

I didn't do anything wrong.
- Shh.

Janine.
It's not fair.
You're absolutely right.
But sometimes we have to do what is best for everyone, not what is fair.
Now, go with Aunt Dylan and I will make sure you get a whole tray of dessert.
You promise?
Cross my heart.
And hope to die?
Hope to die.
All right, girls.

Best behavior!
Praised be.
It's like a dream.
I think I went to a Bat Mitzvah here once.
They won't let you speak.
I'm sorry.
It is what it is.
Thank you for trying.
I won't give up trying.
You should be a part of these decisions.
I'm going to keep telling them that.
No, don't.

I'm going to see you at home.
We're moving on to the security discussions.
Was she upset?

She's been involved in this from the very beginning.
Well, this is our fault.
We gave them more than they could handle.
They put so much focus on academic pursuits and professional ambition, we let them forget their real purpose.
We won't let that happen again.
Where are they?
They were supposed to be seated when the Ambassador got here.
Patience.

Good evening, everyone.
I want to welcome our guests.
Tonight is a celebration of Gilead and of what we have achieved.
We have made great strides cleaning the environment, and restoring a healthy and moral way of life.
And we're very proud of what we're leaving behind for future generations.
But we know that none of it matters if we cannot solve our most pressing problem.
And we have finally begun to do just that.
With God's blessing, and with the devotion of a group of girls.
Please, stand.
Tonight we honor your contribution.
And now, for our guests, we have a very special surprise.
It is my honor to present to you the children of Gilead.
All brought forth in this district by our Handmaids.
Now, let's go and say hello to the head table.
Looks like Waterford's gonna get his trade deal.
What did they talk about last night?
What?
I don't know.
You didn't hear anything?
Schedules, dates?
Why do you care so much?
What did you hear?
What does it matter how many oranges we trade with Mexico?
You think they want to trade oranges?
Don't be an idiot.
Gilead only has one thing to trade that anyone wants.
Red tags.
What?
They want to trade us, dummy.
They want to trade for Handmaids.
This can go to the trash.
This can come in here.
Just by the closet.
And those can go, too.

What do you think?
Does it, does it fit?
Well, you look very important.
Are you heading in?
Senior staff meets at 10:00.
You should be coming with me.
So, what are your plans for today?
I'm going to make this place a home.
Tired?
The opposite, actually.
I don't think that I'll be able to get to sleep.
I'm just glad that it went so well.

You, too.
You should discuss with the other Commanders.
See the best way to move forward.
No.
They can wait.
The timing for implementation is the most important thing right now.
You're an amazing woman.
I forgot.
We should...
We should stop.
No.
Hey.
Hey, what's going on?
I should've said something.
I should've said something.

I should've told her.
I should've told her what they do to us.
You're being too hard on yourself.
You were in a room full of Commanders.

I said I was happy.
I said I was happy.
What choice did you have?
I can't be here.

Sit down for a second.

Talk to me.

Offred.

If they find us...

If they find us together, I'm gonna get sent to the colonies.
You're an Eye.
You're untouchable.
It's...

Fuck you, Nick.

They don't rape you, do they?
He doesn't come in here once a month and read you a little scripture and stick his cock up your ass?
I said I was happy!
Offred.

It is not my name.
Can I get you a glass of water?
It's June.
My name.

It's nice to meet you, June.
Here.
I'll let the Commander know you're here.
Thank you.

Oh, good morning.
Blessed be the fruit.
You must be going on one of your walks?
Yes.
Well, I better not keep my partner waiting.
Of course.

Oh, um, I just wanted to give you a gift, um, to thank you for your candor.
It was invaluable.
Mexican chocolates, from my home town.
Thank you, for helping me understand your world a bit.
Under His eye.
But you don't understand.
I lied to you.
This is...
A brutal place.
Offred?

If we run, they'll try to kill us.
Or worse.
They beat us.
They use cattle prods to try to get us to behave.
If we're caught reading, they'll cut off a finger.
Second offense, just the whole hand.
They gouge out our eyes.
They just maim us in worse ways than you can imagine.
They rape me.
Just every month.
Whenever I might be fertile.
I'm...
Sorry.
I didn't choose this.
They caught me.
I was trying to escape.
They took my daughter.
So don't be sorry.
Okay?
Please don't be sorry.
Please do something.
I...
Can't help you.
What are you going to trade us for?
Hmm?
What?
Fucking chocolate?
We're human beings.
How can you do that?
How?
How can you do that?
I am from Xipica, Ms. Offred.
It is nice city, maybe the size of Boston.
There hasn't been a child born alive in Xipica in six years.
My country is dying.
My country's already dead.
Ambassador.

Is everything all right?
I was just giving Offred a farewell gift.
I have one for Mrs. Waterford as well.
That's very kind of you.
Please.
Straight ahead.

Offred?
I have to go.
I want to help you.
I don't know where your daughter is, but I think I can get a message to your husband.
My husband's dead.
Lucas Bankole, born 29 April, 1980, in Nyack, formerly New York State.
He's alive.
No.
I heard shots.
We don't have much time.
Please...
June.
Write something.
I'll try to get it to him.
