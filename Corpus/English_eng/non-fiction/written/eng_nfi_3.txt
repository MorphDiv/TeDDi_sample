What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Hey yeah
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Ohh
What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end
Where do I start
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you up then you're down and then between
Ohh I really want to know...
What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Hey yeah
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Ohh
What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end
First you wanna go to the left then you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up then you're down and then between
Ohh I really wanna know...
What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Hey yeah
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
I want to know...
Oh
What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
(Oh baby) Ohh ohh ohh
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh (This is ours baby, yeah)
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
(You're so confusing baby) Hey yeah
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
(Be more straight forward)
Oh
What do you mean?
(Give it back back back) Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
(Give it back back back) Oh Oh Oh
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
