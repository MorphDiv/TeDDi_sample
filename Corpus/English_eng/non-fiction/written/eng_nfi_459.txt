A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [theme music playing]
Mr. Bray...

I work as a guard at the C1, the detention center in Military District I.
DESCENT INTO HELL
I know where the missing people are.
The people we bring here are referred to as "strategic targets."
They have information that's of interest to the army.
About the cartels, social movements...
We hear everything.

-Government agencies,

civil associations, the press.
After we intercept our targets, we bring them here.
I also have these photos.
We strip them of their humanity.
We break them.
Nobody deserves that.
Do you know what the "microwave" is?
We put a body inside a stack of tires, then we set it on fire.
They burn from the inside out.
[sighing] Here comes the best part.
When they fuck up, we drag them around the yard by the hair.
Like we did to that idiot, RD22.
We tie their hands behind their backs, and we lift them up slowly... until everything breaks.
RD22 is no longer here.
And no one gets out of here alive.
Sons of bitches.
[door opens]
-What are you doing?

What do you mean, "nothing"?

Enough, Emilio.

You shouldn't be snooping.

I'm just playing a game.

[Emiliano mutters]
I'll leave it open.
Dad, it's me...
That's all you have?
Yeah...

What are we going to do?
-We have to bust them out.

He doesn't give out names, streets, or anything.
[Ovni] I can check if he recorded the video with the location function on, but... [keyboard clicking]
-No.

There has to be something in the video.

Take a look.

-Maybe Mosca isn't even there.

Play it again.

No, don't.
Canek.
I'll go.

Canek.
I'm sure we can get something from that video.
I just wanted to see it again.

We just have to...

Come on... [grunting]
Canek!
Let go of me.
Canek.
Calm down.
It's me.

You're...
I'm sorry.
-Are you all right?

[man] Loosen up!
[makes kissing noises]
Control her, Emiliano!

-[man] Go to your right.

[Tomas] You wanted to speak with me, Ms. Vargas?
[horse neighs]
Let him do it on his own.

-Sit down.

[man] That's it.
Very good.
[makes kissing noises]
First, I would like to apologize for the misunderstanding we had yesterday.
I didn't mean to--
You don't need to apologize.
[Anna] I'd like to form an alliance with you.

[man] Keep her moving.

[Anna] How's the search for Emilia going?
All of those press conferences of yours.
That reward you're offering.
Get to the point, please.
You think Barquet listens to you because you managed to have me fired, but you're mistaken.
If you want to work with him and have him actually listen to you, you'll need me.
Maybe.
But right now I'm busy with my grandson.
That's it!

-If you'll excuse me.

Loosen up on the reins a bit.
Easy.
[Juan] We tie their hands behind their backs, and lift them slowly until everything breaks.

Ms. Vargas was removed from her post due to a conflict of interest
-related to the Nava murder investigation.

I'm a professional, first and foremost.
[Tomas] I think we rushed our decision.
There's no reason why her career should be affected.
She's a great asset.
Yes, but I can't be going back on my decisions just because you two made up.
I'm sorry, Pepe.

I know you're both great at your jobs.
I should have never doubted Anna's professionalism.
I know you need me, Pepe.

We need to work together.
We must show that Los Pinos stands in solidarity with the Urquiza family.
We need to release a statement addressing the issue of the reward.
We need them to trust us.
All right.
Tomas...

Thank you, Pepe.

-Anna.

This is the last time you'll manipulate me like this.
You're not irreplaceable.
Has Patricia asked you about Jaime Bray's meth lab?
I'll take care of it.
If you'll excuse me, Mr. President.
This video was made three weeks ago.

What Juan's doing here...

These are the identification numbers of the missing people.

We have to get in.
How can we break into the C1?

What do you mean, "how"?
The same way we got into CENAPAZ.

We're not talking about an empty building.

You heard what Juan said.

There's a guard change at 6:30 a.m. and another one at eleven o'clock.
And Mondays, every Monday, a truck goes there to take out the bodies in... fucking garbage bags.
Enough, Canek.

Chela, come on.
We have all the fucking information and a guy on the inside.
You know what would be insane?

[Emilia] On the contrary, Canek.
We don't have the resources or the manpower
-for a frontal attack strategy.

We are talking about a covert army operation!
No, you still don't get it.

Citlalli Lopez.

They're killing them.
They're hanging them.
Burning them.
And throwing them into a fucking ditch to rot, like dogs!
-Take it down a notch, Canek Lagos.

I'm not saying that.
All that I'm saying is that we need to come up with a smart way to do it.
Or we'll all end up in that ditch.
We have to think things through.
You're saying Citlalli's alive, but you won't help us?
[Emilia] I'm not saying that!
I'm saying that we need to find the right way to do it.
I'm out.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

Any news on the first lady's whereabouts?
I'm sorry, your questions will have to wait.
I'm here with Mr. Urquiza, and I would like to start by saying... how moved I was by his recent announcement... in which he offered a reward to anyone who helps bring his daughter back safe and sound.
And, even though my contribution will be insignificant in comparison,
I would like to announce... that I, personally, will be contributing to this reward.
Furthermore, I would like to reaffirm my solidarity with the Nava and Urquiza families during these difficult times.
[reporters clamoring] [gasps]
-Are you all right?

-What have you got there?

Nothing, just some old toys.
Hm.
-Emi.

-If you need to talk, I'm here.

I heard that Mr. Urquiza was here trying to resurrect your career.
-What did you do to win him over?

What happened is that Mr. Urquiza realized this government would collapse without me.
There are too many wolves at the president's door.
I'm here to keep them at bay.
[chuckles]
If you'll excuse me.
Ah!
General.
Good luck in Guerrero.
[Patricia] Is there any connection?
Anything, no matter how insignificant.
No, none.
I spoke to everyone: the preventive and ministerial federal police, the DEA.
The only thing that guy did in Colombia was break up cartels.
That's why Emilia hired him.
[sighs] I'm entirely sure that there's no connection to Jaime Bray.
Besides, there's no evidence to the contrary.
It's Aguirre.

Well, but, he can't stop the president.
No.
What we need is for the president to want to betray the general.
I'll meet with him right now.
-Ma'am, I need--

[sighs]
Looking for something, babe?
[in English] Don't worry about that.
I can handle it, believe me.
No, no, no, no. [chuckles]
I know you think you can...
But... [groans] there is some concern that you're spreading yourself a little too thin.
I always find it interesting that you quote others when it's really just your thoughts.
Let me remind you of something.
I am one of the best-placed assets in Latin America.
And I plan to stay right where I am.
In the thick of it.
[in Spanish] That's it, damn it!
That's how I like it.
[in English] Good.

[chuckles]
Get some fucking clothes on, 'cause I have to get to work.
[groans] [in Spanish] What's wrong, babe?
Let's go.
Where?
Anywhere.
[Canek] What the hell for?
Four hundred twenty-two thousand pesos, the last three years of my fucking life.
That hag's right, Canek.
There's nothing we can do to help Citlalli.
Look at us.

Let's get out of here.
Let's go somewhere we can start a life together.
The life we deserve.
"The life we deserve"?
Nobody...
Nobody deserves to be happy, Zyan.
Because happiness is not a right.

Exactly, we can earn it.

It'll be better for you and me.
This isn't about Citlalli.
Or about the missing people.
Or your bullshit about saving Mexico.
-It's about her.

Of course it is.

And sooner or later, they'll come for all of us.
And you'll be the first, for being an idiot.
Let go of me!
[Patricia] General Aguirre.
My forensics team wasn't allowed in Bray's warehouse.

[sighs]
Ma'am, this investigation is in the hands of the army.
Since it's a matter of national security, you can understand why it's classified.
You're making a mistake.

He's Colombian.
Yes, and we're Mexican.
I looked into Bray's background.

He has gone after and exposed money launderers in Colombia.
Oh, ma'am.
There are so many wolves in sheep's clothing.
Just look at Mrs. Urquiza.

The Colombian and Mexican drug cartels have been linked since the '80s.
This is about settling scores.
If you'd like, I can get the appropriate report to your office, today.
But Jaime Bray is our business.
If you'll excuse me.
Ma'am.
-I have to tell you something.

I need a forensics report.
[man] Does the inmate have bruises or injuries sustained... during his transfer from Mexico City?
-No, none that I can see.

[shutter clicking]
Anything else you'd like to add?
No, no.

-Good.

Goodbye.
[guard] Door!
[door opens]
-Listen, little princess.

A little birdie told me you think you're the shit.
[shrieks]
Don't worry, little princess.

Welcome to hell.
[guard] Door!
He's a little weak.
I want to help, Canek.

It's just that it is too risky for everyone.
When I was in jail... there was a doctor.
He'd been living there for a shitload of years.
In a tiny cell, filled with books.
And even though his cell was so small, his world was huge.
And do you know why?
Because he didn't just think about himself.
That's not fair.
I'm doing everything I can.
To each his own, right?
[inaudible dialogue]
[Tomas] Emiliano.
Hi, Grandpa.
What's that?
What are you doing with that?
Where did you get this?
Please, Grandpa, don't be mad.
What's going on?
What did you do, Emiliano?
Maria was snooping in your computer.

What?
Yes, I was.
-How dare you invade my privacy?

You can't deny it.

What the hell are you talking about?
You're helping her hide, right?
Where is she?
I don't know.
I wish I did.
I've recovered the GPS markers from some of the photos that were erased.
[Emilia] Can we find out where the C1 is?
Not exactly, but we can pinpoint the area where it might be.
Let's see it.
I could triangulate, but I don't have enough information.
We'll check the area, little by little... and we'll find it.
-[Canek] Where's Zyan?

Let me in.

Thanks, bro.
Hi there.
[Patricia] 48 shell casings from automatic weapons were found.
There are blood samples from at least four people.
We have--
I hope you understand that this lab must remain in the army's possession.
Of course.
For the sake of national security, I know.
-Can we be frank?

Anything in that warehouse that could have led us to Emilia Urquiza is now ash.
[Pepe sighs]
What is this?
Um, although I'm under no obligation to explain anything to you,
I thought that this might help you get back to your investigation... and move on from this distraction.
What exactly am I looking at?
Infrared photos taken by a DEA drone.
They were taken just above Jaime Bray's warehouse.
As you can see, the surrounding buildings are blue, while the middle one is red.
-That's heat.

I've seen photos like these before.

-Go ahead.

I'll take care of it, thank you.
-Is that all?

I won't take up any more of your time.

They can clear up any doubts you might have.
We'll see.
If you'll excuse me.
I need to speak with the evening news anchor.
Yes, her, Alicia Gonzalez.
[cell phone ringing]
-Hello?

What's your name?
My name is irrelevant.
What matters is that I have information on where Jaime Bray is.
I know where Emilia Urquiza is.
And I want half a million pesos, cash, now.
How do I know this isn't a trick?

I can show you where Jaime Bray is buried.
You know who Jaime Bray was, right?
Well, he was with Emilia Urquiza when he was killed.
I'm talking about the Colombian who was the director of CENAPAZ.
He was Emilia's right hand.
Hidden Grave
[Alicia] I'll need time to get that kind of money.
But if you take me there, and we can identify Bray's body, and the information you give us leads us
-to Emilia Urquiza, we'll pay you.

But I'll need you to take me there.
[Canek] First, you give me the money.

I don't want photos, or cameras or anything.
The only thing I want is my money.
I can give you 150,000 pesos in cash, but I can guarantee you'll get the rest in a couple of hours.
As soon as I confirm this information.
Two hundred grand or nothing.
I'll meet you at the Chimalli Warrior monument.
Once you get to the corner, wait for my call.
We have an informant, sir.
He's going to speak to a reporter.
[Patricia] Good afternoon.
-So?

What?

Barquet managed to get the DEA drones to magically show that the fire at the warehouse was caused by a meth lab.
That's not possible.

Excuse me.
-You requested a forensics report?

CENAPAZ stationery?
-Where did you find this?

[man] The reporter is in position.
Start filming as soon as you see him, understood?
Fucking Canek.
Damn it, Canek.
Damn it!
We're here.
I'm wearing a black jacket and a hat.
[man] Sir, he's calling again.
There he is!
[tires screeching]
[Emilia] There's nothing there.
The GPS tracker has a margin of error of about 1000 meters.
I can zoom out to see if we can find a building using a larger radius.
That looks like a school, right?

Yes.
-And this is some sort of factory.

Where the hell is he?
What are you talking about?
-Where the hell is Canek?

TELL CHRIS I'M BRINGING HER BACK.
This can't be right.

Oh, no?
Then where is he?

-I don't know!

Turn on the news.
[man] Reports confirm that Jaime Bray's body was found here.
What?
[doctor] So, you already showed them who's the big shot here.
[chuckles]
You've only been here a year and they're already calling you El Bravo.
They could kill you for that.
Or is that what you want?
Why do you fight?
Do you do it to survive?

[man] You're fucked.
[doctor] Your prison... goes beyond those damn bars.
You have to go in through yours to get out of ours.
Thank you.
