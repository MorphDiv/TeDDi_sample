- Got it!
- He got the paper!
Uncle, I have the paper.
Attention, children..
..please don't start answering your question paper yet.
Pretty soon we'll be giving out the correct answers to all the questions.
No child is going to fail their English exam this year... because I've taken the responsibility to help you..
..cheat and pass.
- Ohh, Birbal... where's the guy?
The paper has been distributed already, it's getting late.
Uncle, don't get so restless.
He'll be here soon.
This is the English exam.

He's a qualified advocate!
B.A.L.L.B.
Where have you been, sir?
The paper has been distributed.
It's getting late and the children are waiting.
Hello, sir.
Good morning, children.
- Question no. 1...

Meaning Composition.
Those with even roll numbers... like 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...

And those with odd roll numbers will write on 'The Cow'.
If everyone writes the same essay... the examiner will think that you've all copied.

- So now, write as I say.

"l have many friends."
"But Brijmohan Arora is my best friend."
Please don't write the name Brijmohan Arora... instead write the name of your best friend.
Now for those writing an essay on the cow...
"Cow is an holy animal."
'HOLY...'
- Please don't misspell holy, you rascals.
- Otherwise you'll get less marks.
See, uncle, the paper has been finished before time.
Now pay up, I must get to the court.
- Here you go.

3000?
- Wasn't the deal for 5000?

You came 15 minutes late, sir.
Call it a late fee.
I knew you would do something sneaky like this.
I answered the last four questions wrong!
- What?

And only 15 minutes are left now.
You charged them for 1st class results but I doubt they'll even pass.
Let's see what you can do now!
Do something.
Children, don't submit your answer sheets yet.
There's been an error.
- The lawyer will rectify it!
Here...
Please submit your papers to the examiner.
What is he saying?
All your answers are absolutely correct.
Even Obama's mom can't fail you this time!
Jai Hind.
But you said that the last four answers were wrong.
The name's Jagdishwar Mishra aka Jolly!
Lawyer by profession... and a resident of Kanpur.
If I let an illiterate like you make a fool of me... then what good is my law degree?
See you.
If you need anything, do call.
Watch out!

Move aside!
Hello, Mr. Jolly.
- Hello-hello.

- Hello!

Watch where you're going!
Do you want to read everything in one day?
Corning here every day won't make a difference, Hina.
- Mr. Rizvi won't get convinced so easily.
I'm a lawyer too.
Why don't you tell me about your case?
Have faith in me.
No, sir... that's not the point.
You see, Rizvi sir has defended such cases before, and so...
And anyway no high-profile lawyer is willing to take up my case.
Mr. Rizvi is my only hope.
Who knows maybe someday he'll take pity on my condition.
I pity you, even if he doesn't.
Take my advice, Hina and don't come here.
It's no use.
Rizvi sir won't defend your case.

How can I give up so easily, sir?
- Listen...
Can you put in a word for me?
Who?

- Yes..

- Please..

Just put in a word for me once.
You're one of his oldest assistants, he might listen to you.
Please try, for my sake.

Okay, let's assume that he agrees.
How will you pay his fee?
Do you know how expensive he is?
Have you thought about where you'll get the money from?
No, I'll pay him whatever his fee comes to.
Don't worry.
I just want him to agree.
Fine, I'll talk to him today... if he's in a good mood.
Because he's flying to Delhi tomorrow.
Thank you very much, sir.
- Just a minute.

Case files.
He'll understand everything once he reads these.
I will wait for your call.
- Goodbye.

Madam, should I handle your case?
Get lost, you good-for-nothing lawyer.
Take Lord Ram's name.
Take Lord Shyam's name.
Take Lord Krishna's name.
Lord Mukund Madhav, Govind...
Jolly!

- Take Lord Shyam's name...
If Rizvi sir gets furious, I'll blame you.
Take Lord Ram's name...
Get some stamp papers as well!
Secretary.
Why?

And my father was the secretary, Pandey... not me.
I'll need a secretary pretty soon.
Remember to send in your resume.
Why are you getting so furious?
I was just joking.
You should be thankful that I'm only furious... and not getting violent.
Or maybe I should?
- Seems like Rizvi sir has arrived.

- Hold this.

Hey Raju..

- Mr. Rizvi is here.
- Greetings.

What's today's schedule?
Sir, the minister's statement is supposed to be recorded today... regarding the LDA land grabbing case.
And then the charge-sheet is supposed to be filed today... in the session's court for the Sitapur murder case.
Then...
You must get to the High Court by 2 o'clock, sir... for the Ganj blast case.
- And then at five...

There's only so much I can do in one day.
- I'll only go to the High Court today.

- Did you forget something?

Oh yes...
Sorry!
State vs Kurla.
With your permission, may I go on your behalf to the sessions court?
You will be happy to know that I've studied the entire case.
You?

Well, there's no one in Lucknow yet who can fill my shoes.
- If you don't believe me, ask your father.
First learn court etiquette.
You don't have an ounce of civility in you.
I only asked because I was free.
Stick to doing what you know.
There's a party at my house in the evening.
My wife will need your help.

Sir, there's a girl who wants...
- Hey Jolly!
Come here.
Listen!
You come here!
I have a case for you.
I'm not playing anymore.
This isn't right, Jolly, you were winning.
Should I be a loser like you?
- Will you take the case?

He is.
- Him?
Where did you find him?
Looks like I'll have to pay him instead.
He's already paid in advance.
But if you don't win, you'll have to return the fee.
A real lawyer never returns the fee.
What is the case?
It's interesting.
- Who is the judge?

- Come on..

Come, Mr. Sitaram.
Yes, please begin.
- Your Honour, Fifteen years ago my client...

Stand up!

Oh yes, Your Honour...
Sorry!
Your Honour, Fifteen years ago my client's relatives... faked his death certificate and usurped his entire property.
For the last 15 years, he's been trying to prove that he's alive.
How strange!
According to my papers your client has been dead for 15 years.
Look... here's the death certificate and the letter from the village council.
And a report from the local counsellor.
That's all paper, Your Honour.
The dead body is standing in front of you alive.
So what?
You must get me some kind of legal document... with his name written on it.
The Court believes in documented facts.
Bring it in writing and I will believe that he's Shahrukh Khan.
- Please don't do this.
Please order an investigation.

Your request is denied.
Your Honour, I beg you, please listen to me.
You see I finally have a case.
I've even taken an advance, I can't return the fee.

You don't have any court manners.
I'll learn everything.
Please, just listen.
This lawyer will bless you.
I swear to God, you look just like Manmohan Singh in this turban.
Don't you understand?
I'll charge you with contempt of court, and you'll be rotting in jail.
Your Honour, please have mercy on this helpless soul.
I've been doing rounds of the court for the last 15 years... and now I'm completely ruined!
Poor guy's wailing!
He's completely shattered.
Please show him some mercy.
Tell your client to stop this charade, it's not going to work.
Take him away!
I'll go, but not without giving you a gift!
Sitaram!
No, Sitaram..

No, Sitaram.. no..
No.

Lock him up!
Court is adjourned!
Now there's an FIR against Sitaram.
That poor guy's going to rot in jail now.
And we'll have to return the money as well.
on, Jolly...
- Brilliant move, sir!
In fifteen minutes you achieved... what others couldn't in 15 years.
A police FIR, but at least my name's on a legal document now.
Now show that copy of the FIR to the administrator, uncle.
Along with the cutting of the news report... which will get published in tomorrow's newspaper.
"Dead Sitaram hurls a shoe at the judge."
- Yes.

- Take care, Sitaram!

You're so crafty.
But how long will you waste away at Rizvi's place?
Just a few more days.
Once I have my own chamber, I'll quit.
Where to?
To make kebabs at Rizvi sir's home.

No, you're the multi-talented one.
Pushpa!
Pushpa!
Pushpa, sweetheart!
Open the door, Pushpa!
- Oh no.

- Open the door, Pushpa!
What was the fight about this time, Jolly?
It's nothing, aunty.
It's her younger brother's wedding.
She wanted a Gucci dress.
I said no and she started World War 3.
- Pushpa!

Get up and get the ladder.
Jolly and Pushpa fought again.

- Help your neighbor.

Jolly, why don't you shift someplace else?
At least I won't have to stay up nights.
You're making my life hell.
Why don't you shift someplace else?
You think I can't come in if you don't open the door?
Pushpa Pandey...

I'm talking to you, stop pretending.

Even wars have cease fires at night.
Get up, we can get back to being at loggerheads in the morning.
- Rizvi sir threw a party.
I snuck a bottle for you.
Don't say that I didn't offer you.
Glory to Lord!
Hari Om!

Don't think this changes anything.
This is only because you spoke about a cease fire.
You didn't get me the Gucci dress.
Now you're pretending to love me?
What do you mean by Pushpa?
Don't I love you?
Be honest, don't I love you?
Show me one husband in Lucknow... who makes a drink for his wife.
I'll concede.
If anyone finds out about this... we'll be ostracized.
And if I ostracize you, imagine what you won't be getting.
There's no reason to be so hot-headed.
All I need is a Lawyer's chamber.
And then I'll buy the entire Gucci store for you.
Just make do till then.
You make do with yourself till then.
And what will you tell your Rizvi sir... once you get your own chamber.
He doesn't consider me a lawyer.
Always treated me like his secretary's son.
After all, he's a blue blood of Lucknow.
He assumes I'll be his secretary... for the next 30 years like my father.
But once... I have my own chamber...
I'll show him what a secretary's son can do.
Just wait and watch, Pushpa... the city of Lucknow... will be talking about me.
Clients will queue up outside my office.
I'll win many cases and the world will say...
"There goes Jagdishwar Mishra..
"and his wife Pushpa Pandey in their Rolls Royce."
Pushpa".
- Mama, I have to pee.
Mom's out cold.
I'll take you.
Let me unzip your pant.
Go on...
Aim for the plant.
Here you go, Mr. Dubey.
Now quickly allot me a chamber.
Only after you pay in full.
There's only 200000 left.
I'll pay Up-
Give me the allotment letter... and I'll pay the rest.
Don't you believe me?
I told you... chambers are only for senior lawyers.
And you're Mr. Rizvi's 15th assistant.
You're just an amateur now.
Why else would I pay 1.2 million for a chamber that costs only 800000?
But don't underestimate me.
I have fought cases independently.
I have a visiting card and an assistant.
Him?
Birbal?
Two days ago, he was selling tickets illegally outside the movie hall.
How much do you make?
That's my personal matter.

Did I ever ask you how much you earn by selling betel leaves?
- Yadav!

- These are 20 betel leaves.

- Don't give them to anyone for free.

- Listen, mister..

We are in a precarious situation.
Some unemployed lawyer, like you... has filed a petition in the High Court against chamber allotment.
The hearing is after the 'Holi' festival.
If he wins then you will lose your one million.
That's why my advice is... get me the 200000 by tomorrow... and take your letter.
But, Mr. Dubey, how can we arrange for 200000 by tomorrow?
We need some time.
You're a lawyer.

Haven't you heard...
A politician without his seat, a superstar without a hit... and a lawyer without a chamber is a nobody.
Here, take this free betel leaf.
Eat it, boss, it's worth 200000.
Don't touch!
200000, by tomorrow.
We're in trouble, boss.
We'll have to think of something.
- We can't lose this chamber.

You?
How did you get here?
I was trying to call you, but you didn't answer.
- I was busy in a meeting.

Did you talk to Rizvi sir about my case?
Yes, I talked to him and... the good news is that he agreed.
Really?
He's agreed to take up my case?
Of course he did.
He said, "I'll fight the case".
I told you he would listen to you.
So when will my petition be filed?
After 'Holi'...
Come back after 'Holi'.
God bless you, sir, thank you very much.
No, not at all.
Thank you.
Well...

Rizvi sir said that I should tell you about the fee.
Yes, of course.
How much will it be?
He said 200000.
That's too much.
Like I said, Rizvi sir is a very expensive lawyer.
- If you can't afford it, let it be.

Don't worry at all.
Just give me some time.
Give me until tomorrow...

For sure.
Great.
Then tomorrow...
- Yes, I'll bring it.

- Thank you.

If I don't give him 200000 more... then I'll lose the one million which I have already given him.
You're right.
- But what if something goes wrong later?

How?
Once I get the chamber I'll get... a loan against the chamber's documents.
It's a matter of a couple of days.
You're right.
Fine...
Jolly, 'Holi' is going to be fun this year.
Where are you taking me?
- Let me see.

- Now look.

Mishra Law Firm.
- Jagdishwar Mishra (JOLLY) BALL...
No, father, it's not BALL... its B.A.L.L.B.
Oh yes... ls this yours?
You worked here for 30 years, didn't you?
Yes.
You wanted your son to have his own chamber.
- Wasn't that your dream?

I've fulfilled your dream.
"You shoot me with your eyes."
"You shoot me."
"It's a poison that kills slowly."
"Slowly."
"You shoot me with your eyes."
"It's a poison that kills slowly."
"I'll throw colors at you and wet you."
"I'll color your cheeks red because today is Holi, baby."
"Go mad."
"Go.

"Go.

"Go.

"Go.

"You look lovely when you are wet, you look colorful."
"You come and snatch away my heart."
"Get intoxicated, enjoy the festival."
"Enjoy since it's Holi."
"Go mad.

"Wear glasses to protect your eyes.

"I've my friends with me, don't act coy."
"I've opened the bottle today as its Holi today."
"Go mad."
"Go.

"Go.

"Go.

"Go.

"I'll ruin your intentions."
"I'll ruin.."
"l won't let you do as you wish."
"As you wish."
"Go mad."
"I'll ruin your intentions."
"l won't let you do as you wish."
"Don't tease me, don't follow me."
"Don't come after me, stop teasing me."
- "it's Holi!

"Go.

"Go.

"Go.

"Go.

"Go.

"Go.

"Go.

"Go.

"Satisfaction guaranteed."
- How is it?

- Advertise all over the city.

Jolly, where did she come from?
Pandey is with her.
Why did you do this to me?
Why did you deceive me?
You should've taken pity on my condition before lying to me.
What are you saying, madam?
Who deceived who?
He did!
ls this how you play with people's lives?
Was I the only one you found?
They killed my husband.
For eight months, I've been doing the rounds of the court in this condition!
I'm tired.
You could've just said no like others did.
I would've gone away.
Look, you're mistaken.
I don't understand what you're saying.
Ask him!
Tell them.
Tell them the truth.
Tell them!
He took 200000 from me using Mr. Rizvi's name.
And he has no clue.
You want more, here take it.
Take it...
Take everything!
Everything!
Jolly!

I'm asking you, do you know her?
Yes, I do...
Did you take money from her?
Yes, I did but I'll pay her back in two days.
I don't want your money.
I want justice!
Can you get me that?
Tell me, can you?
I never hurt you in any way.
In fact, I never hurt anyone.
You took away whatever hope I had.
What will I do?

What are you all looking at?

Come on... go!
Hina... there you are, dear.
I was looking for you downstairs.
Come down, dear...
I can't keep climbing these stairs all day.
Come on!
- Come, dear.
- Come on!
Hina!
Hina!
Hina!
Hina!
- Hello Mr. Rizvi.

I refused to take Hina's case in the first meeting!
And you kept siphoning money from her in my name!
You're responsible for her death!

Rizvi sir, I worked for you for 30 years.
If I'd known that Jolly was going to do...
Really?
How do I believe that you didn't have any clue about what he did?
- Mishra, his salary is just Rs. 7000!
He gets betel leaf and kebabs for me.
He even cleans my car.
And you thought he's become a hot shot lawyer?
He'll sit in his own chamber?
He dares to match me!
I apologize for his mistake, Rizvi sir.
Please forgive him.
I respect you.
Before I call the police and throw you two in jail... get lost.
Gut!
Gut!
Jolly...
I worked here for 30 years.
Thirty years...
I couldn't become a lawyer like you.
But I had earned a lot of respect.
And now you destroyed that as well.
- I made a mistake...

I made the mistake.
Now do me a favor and don't show me your wretched face again!
- No, father...

It was a mistake, father.
Hina!
- Jolly?
- What's wrong?
Did you dream about Hina again?
I'll get you water.
"Conscience has appealed to you."
"Help me take the right step, Lord."
I want justice!
Can you give me that?
"I've convinced my heart."
"Light your lamp, Lord."
"Guide my way out of problems, light of God."
"Lord, my beloved."
"You are the creator of destiny, solve the problems."
"How many prayers do I need to offer for this wrong?

"Look, my life is ruins."
"Where do I go and pray and express my sorrows?"
"Guide my way out of problems, light of God."
"Lord, my beloved."
- Jai Hind, sir.

Where are you taking him, sir?
Singh sir has set him free.
Iqbal!

Your special bail has been approved.
Get ready, we leave in a bit.
Okay. let's go.
Hina, the wedding procession is here!
Look...
"Apply henna."
- Mr. Iqbal Qasim, do you take...
- Hina Siddiqui, daughter of Zahur Ali Siddiqui...
- as your lawfully wedded wife?
- I do!

Amen!

Amen!
- Do you accept?
I do.
- Congratulations!
- Look here.
- Look in front.
One more.
- What are you reading?
Your ball application.
I'll get bail easily, you just wait and watch.
I've been arrested due to some misunderstanding.
And they are such nice people.
Bail for a wedding, who gets that?
But we need to file an application.
I can't see you handcuffed anymore.
Where are the handcuffs?

What's this?
Where?

Where are the handcuffs?
Where are they?
Trying to be clever?

- Jai Hind, sir.

Sir, in the van.
Bring him out.
- Get him out.

- Sir...
Congratulations, Iqbal...

Qadri?
It's Iqbal Qasim, sir.
Your wedding will be recorded in the Guinness Book.
"Special bail for marriage with handcuffs."
All thanks to you, Singh sir.
Please sort this confusion out and help me get bail.
Please...
Singh sir...
Sir, let me congratulate you in advance for another promotion.
- What did you do?
Sorry, Bhadoriya.
You're going to retire this month anyway.
You'll have enough time to recover.
And you'll get a fat compensation for getting injured on duty.
Sir...
And I'll send you a little something too.
- Siraj!

Take him to the hospital.
Get him in the van.
What is the name of the lawyer who filed the PIL?
Some Jagdishwar Mishra... they call him Jolly.
Do you know him?
No, never heard of him.
- What are the chances, Mathur sir?

An officer like you should be awarded.
- Instead, he'll make you stand in the witness box?
What am I here for?
Singh sir, you're an old friend.
Your case, is my case.
Would you like me to tear up this PIL right now?
And that's exactly what Justice Tripathi will do on day 1.
He'll tear it up and throw it in the dustbin.
Please excuse me, I must leave for golf.
Mushtaq will explain the rest to you.
Just remember one thing.
Don't allow any details, documents or papers... connected to this case to leak out.
Keep the lid tight at your end.
We'll see who gets through.
Goodbye.
Mushtaq.
- Sir, this is the rate card.

It's a murder case... so these are all the package options.
Look!
If you want to drag the case, then it'll be 1.5 million.
To reduce your sentence, it'll be 2.5 million.
And if you want to get acquitted, it'll be five million.
Taxes are extra.
You can select any package you like... and we'll activate that scheme, sir.
- Which package did you like, sir?

Thank you, sir.
Sir, your bill.

What is this?
This is for your tea and biscuits.
Tea and biscuits as well.
There's nothing free in this office, sir.
You've got a discount because you're a cop.
That's why we haven't charged you for the AC and fan.
Have a nice day, sir.
Good Morning Sir.
Good Morning.
Good Morning.
Yes, Om Prakash, show me.
Please get some water.
Let's see.
Leave the chair and hold this, Om Prakash.
Jagdishwar Mishra aka Jolly?
Yes.
Do you have a brother in Delhi?
No, sir.

Forget it.
Nothing.

So who's from defense?
Mr. Pramod Mathur.
- He's on his way.

Why didn't he come on time?
I'm not used to coming on time.
And Lucknow court is not known for its punctuality.
So I was sitting in my car.
Things always get done on time in my court.
- Right?
- Don't forget next time.
It'll be good for both of us.
Sit.
- So, Mr. Jolly, please begin.
Sir, on 13th August, Twenty inspector...
Suryaveer Singh and his team shot dead Iqbal Qasim... a resident of Lucknow, in an encounter.
But we believe it's a fake encounter... and it calls for a high-level investigation.
Respected sir, the investigation which he's demanding... has already been carried out by the police department.
And the outcome was...
Iqbal snatched constable Bhadoria's service revolver... shot him and tried to escape.
The police, was forced to take necessary action.
Sir, there are many loopholes in this story.
And it's not just about Iqbal, sir.
Constable Baldev Singh Bhadoria's death... .. in this encounter is also suspicious.
Stop making such tall claims.
What are you trying to say?
That the police shot one of their own men.
No, sir all I want to say is that... this case demands an unbiased investigation.
Again!
What do you want?
The investigation is already done.
And why should we re-investigate?
This is like the story... of the man who had nothing to do... so he ripped his clothes and stitched them repeatedly.
These people have nothing to do.
They just wake up one day and file a PIL.
Yes, Sangeeta.

Yes, sweetheart.
Did you like the dress?
It's nice, isn't it?
Oh come on, not your Manish Malhotra again.
He's better, he's Harish Malhotra.
Manish is famous in India Harish is famous in Lucknow.
He's a top designer of Lucknow.
You can make do...
Hello, hello.
Does anyone know Manish Malhotra?
Mr. Mathur, how much do you think a Manish Malhotra dress costs?
It's quite cheap around Rs.500,000 to Rs.600,000.
Rs.500,000 to Rs.600,000?
That's the budget for a whole wedding.
To buy such an expensive dress...
I'll have to be reborn a lawyer like you, in my next life.
It's just not possible on a judge's pay.
Sir!
Your Honour, if we're done discussing the wedding and the dress... can I say something?
Look, Mathur sir is absolutely right.
You want an investigation...
Don't you?
So here's the investigative report.
You can either accept this or get me new evidence.
- Am I wrong?

Then stop posing like a hero.
- Go do your job.
Adjourned!
I didn't know you're a lawyer.
I thought you're Rizvi sir's secretary.
Anyway, it's a good thing.
But why so serious?
Take it easy.
Haven't you seen those hoardings in Lucknow.
They saw-
Smile, you're in Lucknow.
I will smile, Mr. Mathur.
After I put your client in jail.
You Kanpur folks.
This is Lucknow.
We have a saying in Lucknow.
It takes twenty years to build a reputation... and five minutes to ruin it.
And I heard, you have even ruined your father's.
You be careful.
Jolly, did the judge accept the police report?
Of course.
Mr. Mathur is a senior lawyer and the judge is practically new, so... he only listened to him.
When I intervened, he said stop being so dramatic.
Don't try to be a hero.
Jolly, I think the judge is involved with them.
Even I think so.
- How's the vegetable?

I just love your cooking.
Tell me something, what will happen at the next date?
The judge is a grouch.
If I don't present any new evidence, he will reject the PIL.
Yeah, Birbal.
There is a guy who can help us get evidence.
Who is he?
His name is Guruji.

Benares?
- What does he do there?

But I heard he's in some kind of cricket business.
Bookie?
- We'll know when we get there.
- Shall we go?

We leave in the morning, okay.
See you.
- Welcome to Benaras!
- Veiled Eleven Vs Burkha Eleven.
- Indian Ladies League.
- Presented by Vishal Saris, Prayag Pipes..
- B-Tex ointment and LG Hing.
The stake has been raised to 250,000!
And I request the people of Benaras... to bet with all their hearts.
- The match is in its final and decisive moment.
- There's pin-drop silence.

- And this guy is going to help us?

He was a police constable for 40 years.
- He's a very resourceful man.

Amazing guy.
- Next ball by the priest's daughter-in-law.
- At the ladies stump...
- and Shakeela Bano has hit that..
- ..from the middle stump all the way in the air.
- Superb catch!
- And with that Veiled Eleven has recorded...
- a historic win on this pious land.
- Don't forget... next Sunday... we have a superb match lined up.
Moustache Eleven Vs Bearded Eleven!
Yes, please come in large numbers and bet your heart out.
- Glory to..

- Sir, I don't get this business about..
- the Veiled Eleven and the Burkha Eleven.
The match is just an excuse to make money.
But actually it's to explain to the men on both sides... that life without women is meaningless.

- What brings you here?

- Come.

- You see, sir, it's a cop encounter case...
- and we can't find a single piece of paper.
- Not even the FIR copy.

Must be locked away in one of the constable's cupboard.
Exactly, sir.
We came here looking for the key to that cupboard.
You came to the right place.
It will require some money... but I will give you the FIR copy and the charge-sheet.
The thing is we don't have any money.
- The goddess Ganga is my witness... I don't even sneeze without getting paid.
- Sir, we came to you hoping that...

It takes courage to leap before you look, sir.
- How much?

You'll get it.
- Where from Jolly?
What's he doing?
Jolly, one sec...
We're in Benaras after a long time, Birbal.
A dip in the Ganga... might just cleanse me of some of my sins.
- Praise the lord!
If you could've waited just a few more days.
I would've gotten you a better price.
No, Mr. Dubey, I can't wait anymore.
You're selling the chamber 500000 cheaper.
You can be anything, but a lawyer.
I'm trying to be one.
I would first like to question Mr. Suryaveer Singh.
Mr. Suryaveer Singh.
Please come to the witness box.
Singh sir, please tell me, why did you arrest Iqbal?
We had information... that he's associated with some Kashmiri organizations.
Who?

They are the same, they often operate under aliases.
When you arrested Iqbal, what did you recover from him?
- A lot of material.

A laptop, a pen-drive some secret documents... and objectionable literature, like books and CDs.
Do you remember the name of any book?
Huh?
Not now but there were lots of books.
Shall I help?
Allow me.
Your Honour, the first dangerous item recovered from Iqbal's home... was the poet Faiz Ahmed Iqbal's book.
Along with a CD of Ghulam Ali's poetry.
And the other objectionable document is this map of India.
Your Honour, the third item... which is actually dangerous and will completely shock you... is a book in Arabic, a translation of another dangerous book... called the 'Bhagwad Gita'.
What are you saying?
Why will the police call the 'Gita' objectionable literature?
Mistakes are often committed in haste, Your Honour.
And he didn't factor that someday it would be brought up in your court.
I would like to know the source of this information.
This.
This is a copy of the FIR and the Charge-sheet.
Take it.
Along with this a report that contains the list... of all the items recovered from Iqbal.
Please take a close look at the FIR... and you'll notice how 'Qadri' is written..
..in front of Iqbal Qasim with Iqbal's.
But, Jolly sir, what does all this prove?
Just that the case made against Iqbal lacks substance.
Sooner or later this would've been revealed... and would've hampered the promotion of some high-level people.
- Right, Singh sir.
What do you think?
Meet me outside, I'll tell you what I think.
Watch it Mr. Singh.
If I see even a hint of attitude, I'll thrash you silly right here.
That's no way to talk.
You've gone too far.
Sorry, Your Honour.
Hello Sir.
Hello Sir.
- He screamed, and you...
Yes, Singh.
Meet Mr. Basu and Mr. Nair...
- from the Central Bureau of Investigation, New Delhi.
- They have a few questions... about the Iqbal encounter..
..and constable Baldev Singh Bhadoria's death.
So, Mr. Singh, what information did you have about Iqbal... please tell us?
Sir, we had intelligence inputs from Srinagar Police and... I had my own personal information.
The intelligence report from Srinagar was on Iqbal Qadri.
And the person who was shot dead was Iqbal Qasim.
Even if we ignore this confusion... still... how do you explain constable Baldev Singh Bhadoria's death?
Look, Mr. Basu, Singh is one of our best officers.
I'm sure.
I personally assure you that I will conduct an internal inquiry.
Until then, if you can cooperate with us...
Please!
Alright, Mr. Paul.
We had different orders.
But since you're insisting, we'll wait for your report.
- Thank you.
- I don't get it, sir.
We were never questioned about any of our encounters.
Even by the CBI.
How did this matter get to Delhi?
Must be someone on the inside who tipped off the agency.
You're to blame for this too.
You're a star now.
Your pictures are often in the papers.
- What do they call you?
- Super-cop.
Yeah.
Lucknow's daredevil who doesn't bother taking me in confidence either.
- Everything else is alright... but how will you explain Bhadoria's death?
Sir, I didn't know that Bhadoria had heart trouble..
and that he was on blood thinners.
I see.
Otherwise, why would I, I mean...
Anyway, this is not the first complaint against you.
It's an internal inquiry, I'll see what I can do.
You may leave.
Sir.
You knew, didn't you... that this Iqbal wasn't the same Iqbal you were looking for?
- How much were you paid for letting the real Iqbal Qadri go?
What are you looking at?
I'm your boss nothing is hidden from me.
- You're in a big hurry to get promoted, aren't you?
You don't care about the innocent and the guilty.
This time you're in deep trouble, Singh.
Sir, my life's first encounter was with you.
I learned from you that killing someone can get me promoted.
I'm like your son.
Don't forget me now.
We'll be safe as long as we're together.
Jai Hind.
- Zahoor Sir?
- Yes?

I want to get some clothes stitched.
Come in, let me take your measurements.
Pardon me, but the youngsters these days... like to wear ready-made clothes.
What brought you to this old tailor?
I've heard there's magic in your hands.
But my sight doesn't support my hands anymore.
Turn around.
What do you do, son?
I'm a lawyer.
The name's Jolly.
Have you no shame?
How dare you show your face after everything you've done!
Zahoor sir, I know you're angry.
But I need your help with Iqbal's case.
Any information, has anyone ever tried contacting you?
Or have you heard anything?
I know the truth about the case, Zahoor sir.
Iqbal's murderers must be punished.
And Hina?
Who will punish Hina's murderer?
I'm right here, Zahoor sir.
I won't try to justify my crime.
- A few days ago... a young man came to meet me from Jhansi.
He said he's the son of the constable... who died that day with Iqbal.
- He said his name was Ramkumar Bhadoria.
He wrote his name and address on a piece of paper.
This.
Thank you very much!
You're early today.
Why are you smiling?
Let's go eat.
Wait, I'll be right back.
Why?
It's my anniversary dress, the sexy type.
Gucci.
Where did you get the money?
It's rented.
Why didn't you wear it at home?
Then the entire neighborhood... would've followed me here.
I'll only take a minute.
Your eyes will pop out when you see this dress.
Hurry up.

- Jhansi?

You're always in a foul mood.
Hello.

Yes, meet me there, I'll tell you everything.
Hello, Mr. Lawyer.

Let's offer him some if he hasn't.
Huh!
- Shoot him!
Come on shoot.
Jolly!
- Run!
Stop!

Pushpa!

- Pushpa!

Pushpa!
Jolly!
Help!
Help someone!
Jolly!
Pushpa.
Jolly!
What happened to Bhadoria's son?
- Birbal's gone to Jhansi to get him.

Tomorrow onwards you will carry this.
It's not funny, I had my father send this.
If anyone threatens you again, just shoot him.
Here's your patient.
Dad!
- Hello, dad.

I stopped you from coming to see me... so you landed up in hospital... so that I would have to come see you instead?
Do you know how difficult it is... to travel from Kanpur to Lucknow at my age?
How much more are you going to trouble me?
Forgive me, father.
"The crazy heart waits and craves for you."
"Tears rain down my eyes as monsoon melody."
"The crazy heart waits and craves for you."
"Tears rain down my eyes as monsoon melody."
"I'm incomplete without you."
"Everything appears dull."
"The crazy heart waits and craves for you."
"Tears rain down my eyes as monsoon melody."
"What strange joy this is that is like wax?"
"It melts down the eyes with smiles."
"I've prayed for our relationship."
"This bond with you will never get severed."
"This bond with you will never get severed."
"You've erased all evil from my life."
"Tears rain down my eyes as monsoon melody."
The sensational attack on advocate Jagdishwar Mishra... has sparked internal conflicts in the police department.
- The police department has suspended Inspector Suryaveer Singh...
- and tried to separate itself from this matter.

I warned you not to do anything without telling me.
So why did you get him shot?
Singh sir, this is a court case.
Lawyers settle matters in court... not on the streets.
Then do it!

I lost my promotion and the department suspended me.
My entire career is ruined.
And what did you do?
Let me tell you, Mathur sir... if I go down I'll take everyone with me.
I'm warning you!
And who's going to believe you?
Don't forget that you're a suspended police officer... facing murder charges.
You're not some evangelist who people will follow blindly.
Now you listen carefully, Singh.
Neither your department nor the Government's going to save you.
You have only two choices... first, Pramod Mathur and... second, Pramod Mathur.
What do we do now, sir?
I'll smack your face!
You moron!

"What now?"
How long have you been working for me?
Eight years.
Eight years and yet you're nothing more than a rate card bearing waiter!
"What do we do?"
We'll do exactly what Jolly wants.
What's the name of that Jhansi guy?
- The constable's son?

Ram Kumar Bhadoria.
Let him come to court.
Let all the witnesses against us come to court.
We'll deal with them.
What new formula is this, Mr. Mathur?
Pepsi and Pramod never reveal their formula.
Don't worry.

- It's your government...
- Decide carefully.
- See you later.
Okay, yes.
Hello, how are you?
What has the world come to... when lawyers like you are getting shot?
There are rumors spreading about you that... you have quit the case, want to apologize and return to Kanpur.
Kanpur people never flee from battle, Mr. Mathur.
And anyway, as long as there are lawyers like you... lawyers like me are needed to keep the balance.
This is your problem, buddy.
I told you this is Lucknow, discourtesy isn't tolerated here.
You must speak with manners and be civil.
"After you..."
Remember that otherwise.
..you'll be tasting more of Lucknow's special chocolate.
The day I lose my temper...
I'll shove that courtesy up your backside!
You won't be able to take a dump or pass air.
And you can courteously ask your assistant to get it out.
- Mushtaq.

That's a good comeback, note it down.
It will come handy.
Jolly.
How are you?
Are you fine?
Yes, absolutely.
Good!
Please sit.
Everyone, please take a seat.
No point showing such respect for the law.
Most of you must have jumped the red-light while coming here.
Mr. Mathur, your Lucknow is really dangerous.
Isn't it?
I mean, people get shot in broad daylight.
Even judges aren't spared here.
One of his clients hurled a shoe at a judge.
Mr. Mathur, that's not right!
ls it?
You should have told me this before.
I would've arranged for proper security.
Om Prakash.
- Naik, listen.
Put up a notice outside... that no one will wear shoes inside the courtroom.
Get it?
You never know when someone's in a bad mood... and might bring a bomb in his shoes.
He may have fought with his wife.
And might hurl it at the judge.

- Your Honour, we would like to...

Just...
One, two, three, four and... five.
You see, the case has now heated up.
So this is for my self-defense.

Yes, Mr. Jolly, please begin.
Yes.
Sir, we want to record..
..late police constable Baldev Singh Bhadoria's son...
Ram Kumar Bhadoria's statement.
We've already submitted an advance notice, sir.
Yes.
Please tell the judge about your father's death.
Sir, my family lives in Jhansi.
- But back then I was with my father, in Lucknow.
He was on night duty.
At 7-7:30 AM in the morning... I received a call from the hospital... informing me that my father was injured.
I went over.

- l learned that my father had been shot.
- I was really scared.
It was a tense situation.
Everyone was pacing around, worried.
- They were whispering amongst themselves...
- but telling me nothing.
So I couldn't take it anymore.
When I came out, I met ASI Siraj Alam.
- I asked him to tell me what's wrong.
Singh sir accidentally shot him in the leg.
He's lost a lot of blood but he will be fine.
Your Honour, please note that... the police investigation claims that Iqbal shot constable Bhadoria.
But ASI Siraj Alam personally told Ram Kumar... that inspector Singh shot the constable.
- That's all, Your Honour.
Mr. Mathur, your witness please.
Your Honour, according to the police investigation...
Siraj Alam and the rest of the police team..
..never met Ram Kumar that day.
That's why this statement sounds like a movie plot to me.
But I would like to take this a little further.
Ram Kumar, please tell the respected judge... about the compensation that your family received..
..after your father's death.
I object, Your Honour!
Young man, this is just my first question.
And you're already objecting.
I have 20 years of practice.
I won't beat around the bush like you.
I'll be blunt and frank.
Yes, Ram Kumar, how much compensation did you get?
500000.
500000.

A job with UP Roadways as a conductor.
Why don't you be clear?
You got this job on police recommendation... because your father died in the line of duty!
- Yes, sir.
- Am I right?
And now you're accusing that same police department... of murdering your father.
Amazing...
Wasn't the compensation and job enough for you... that you're lying to get more?
Your Honour, the witness is being pressured!
- He is not lying.

And if he's telling the truth... then tell him to return the compensation and quit his job.
How long will you live off a gift given by your father's murderers?
Sir, the witness is the sole breadwinner of a family of eight.
This isn't just a question of compensation or a job.
Mathur sir has nothing to say... so he's just making a mountain out of a molehill.
- That's exactly what I get paid for.

Making a mountain out of a molehill..
..is how I have become the best lawyer in Lucknow.
With hard work and determination.
I don't come from a legacy of court secretaries!
Sir, I won't tolerate any personal comments.
Mathur sir, no personal comments please...
- Mathur sir...

Everything I'm saying is true!
Wasn't your father a secretary?
- Was he the Chief Justice of India?

- Sir, please ask him to shut up, or...

You think you can take me on in those torn shoes and cheap clothes?
Please stop him, that's enough!
- I'm trying!
Mathur sir, please be polite...
Your Honour, to hell with politeness.
I want to know what you'll do.
Sir, stop him or I'll end up doing something.
- Mr. Mathur, Jolly, please don't do this.

I've seen this before.
What happened to your enthusiasm?
- Look here...
You damn secretary!
What happened to your enthusiasm?
What are you doing!
Mathur!
How dare you touch me!
You...
Stop it!
There will be bloodshed!
Order!

Everyone sit down!
Call the boys...
He hit Mathur sir!
I'm trying to speak, let me...
They don't let me speak!
I'm standing here.

He hit Mathur sir!
- Where are you going with the gun?
He's got a gun!
They've got a gun!
- Call the police!
Take the gavel, sir.
They've brought a rifle... and you're handing me the gavel!
Give it to me!
Order!

Police!
Go home?
SP sir, I'm not going to step out of this room... and you're advising me to go home.
What do you mean by nothing happened?
They brought a double-barrel gun to my courtroom.
Should I wait for them to fire a few rounds?

Look SP sir, I request you... please send some security.
I'm not stepping out of the court.
-Yes.
Sir, I apologize.
No!
I apologize to both of you.
- Forgive me, Jolly, it was my fault.
I'm a heart patient.
My daughter's getting married next month... and you two were hurling chairs at me.
I'm extremely sorry... but he started it.
You provoked him first, Mr. Mathur.

But, okay... you're senior.
- Jolly, you apologize to him.

- I didn't do anything.

You slapped him in court!
What's next!

Your Honour, I don't want any apologies.
Let's continue with the court proceedings.
I haven't finished my cross-examination yet..
Look, Mr. Mathur.
I'm not that stupid.
I may look it, but I'm not.
I won't start the proceedings yet.
What if someone brings a cannon to my courtroom next?
Fine, sir.

We have that provision as well, sir.
- I demand Ram Kumar's narco test.

There will be no narco test.
No narcotest.

This is wrong.
That boy's telling the truth.
Look, he's telling the truth, isn't he?
So what's your problem?
Let them do the narco test.
He's telling the truth, and... that's what he'll do in the narco test.
- But...

Jolly please, don't interfere now.
Look, I'm not going to resume the session anytime soon.
This is better, let this case get settled outside the court.
Take this away, Om Prakash, it's not a cap.
- Get some ice in it!

- Okay, goodbye.

- Your Honour...

Please.
Did you go to the Himalayas to get the ice?
- What's your full name?

- Right.
- What did you see when you got to the hospital?
- What did you find?
- l..

- What did you find?

Did ASI Siraj Alam tell you that Singh sir shot your father?
Yes, madam.

- Who asked you to testify in court?
Stop!

Let's take it from here.
Who asked you to give a false testimony in court?
Yes, sir.

- "Who asked you to give a false testimony in court?"
- "Open your eyes.

- "Answer me!"
- "Madam..."
"Jagdishwar Mishra.

- "Jolly asked me..."
No, no, no, Your Honour, this is...
Sir...
- They changed the questions!
Yes, please speak.
Your Honour, this is a lie.

Someone's tampered with the test you just saw, Your Honour.
The truth can't stay hidden for long, sir.
He tried but got exposed.
I apologize for the interruption.
Sir, please believe me, I would never do such a thing.
I know everything.
Do you think I'm clueless in court?
Right, Mr. Mathur?
I'm sure you know what the lawyers of Lucknow call me... outside of court.
Teddy bear, right?
Because I'm jovial, right?
You think, I can't see?
And I'm blind?
- No sir!

I'm sorry that you got shot.
You have my sympathy.
But I cannot ignore your illegal actions in the courtroom.
I sentence Ram Kumar Bhadoria to... three months of judicial custody for lying in court.
Sir...
You want the compensation, the job... and you want to lie in my courtroom?
- No sir!
Take him away before I get him flogged.
Sir you're punishing an innocent man!
You're not innocent either, Mr. Jolly.
I've heard a lot about you.
And so, under CRPC section 340... I order an inquiry against you... ..for presenting a bogus witness in court.
And I recommend the BAR Council... that they cancel your license as soon as they can.
Adjourned!
Now who shoved courtesy up whose backside?

- Move aside!
- Move aside!
- Give way!
Let us move.
Jolly, there's bad news.
The chairman of the BAR Council's Discipline Committee is...
Rizvi sir.
- Hello, sir.
- Hello sir!
This committee finds Jagdishwar Mishra guilty... of assaulting a fellow lawyer and presenting a bogus witness in court... and decides to cancel his license.
And according to the association's rules, the committee also... gives Jolly four days to prove his innocence.
- This is wrong, Rizvi sir!
You should cancel his license immediately!
Listen...
We receive complaints against many lawyers.
If we start cancelling licenses immediately... then pardon me, but only typewriters will be left in court... and no lawyers.
- Rizvi sir!
- Rizvi sir!

We'll see you at the chamber.
- Yes sir.
Rizvi sir, thank you for giving me the four days.
What you're doing takes a lot of courage.
If I had shown the courage to take on the system... then maybe Hina would still be alive.
All the best.
They look so happy.
This reminds me of our wedding.
Jolly, will any of the cops speak in our favor?
No, they are all on Mathur's side.
All five?
Hmmmm.
- There are four, not five.

There are five in this picture.
Five?
How can there be five?
Yes, there are five.
This guy with the beard.
Who is this guy?
That's Baldev Singh Bhadoria.
That's Siraj Alam.
That's Vinod Tiwari...
And that bald one is Sanjay Srivastav.
Bhadoria's dead.
These three are on their side, so... who is this fifth bearded guy?
- Hold on.

Even his uniform is different.
Yes...
Wait a minute.
What's that written on his shoulder?
- JK Police.
Kashmir Police?

That intelligence report was sent from Kashmir, right?
What's his name?

Hold this...
Show me.
Fahim Butt.
Fahim Butt?
Kashmir Police?
I have to go to Kashmir.
- What do we want?

- Justice!
- If I'm martyred...

- Justice!
- If I'm buried it'll be for..

- Justice!
- This land calls for...

- These mountains call for...

- Say it aloud.

- Raise your hands and say!

- In this land!

- The time has come for...

- In this land!

- In this land!

- Kashmiri's want...

- Justice!

- Him?

He's from Kashmir Police.
Take a closer look.
His name is Fahim Butt.
There's a riot outside.
- Please ask someone else.

What's the problem Vani?
Sir we have a visitor inquiring about Fahim Butt.
What trouble are you trying to create?

Sorry sir!
Sir, It's very important that I find this man.
- Look carefully, there's JK on his shoulder badge... and his name is Fahim Butt.
He's wearing the Kashmir police uniform.
Uniforms can be bought for 200 bucks.
Please don't waste our time.
Please leave!
This is Kashmir, a curfew can happen at anytime.
Get him out.
Sir, you'll get me suspended, please leave!
Leave!
- Hello, Mr. Singh.
- There's news for you.

- Justice!
- This Earth wants.

Sir, just a minute.
- Yes.

I'm a guard at the police headquarters.
I saw you speaking to the senior inspector.
- You're looking for Fahim Butt?

- Do you know him?

- Where can I find him?

ln jail?
Everyone knows but nobody will speak up.
Fahim Butt is from my hometown.
He's an innocent man.
But he's being treated very unfairly.
How did a cop land up in jail?
This is Kashmir, sir.
Going to jail is easier than buying a SIM card.
So, how can I meet him now?
He has a court appearance tomorrow morning at 11.
How are you, Mr. Butt?
- What are you doing here?

I read about you in the newspaper.

Mr. Butt, were you in Lucknow when Iqbal was shot?
Yes, I was right there.
Then you must know everything about that encounter.
You're very close to the truth.
If you testify in court... then we can prove it.
But that won't help you in any way.
Why?
An innocent man was killed and you know the truth.
So why won't it help me?
- What about the one who survived?

Run!

- Keep going sir.

- Great Goddess Kali...
Praise Goddess Kali.
I have two minutes.
Say what you have to quickly!
I will only take a minute, Mr. Paul.
I want you to help me with the Iqbal Case.
And why would I do that?
Only one case has been filed out of...
Singh's 25 encounters.
Which has shaken up your entire police department.
You have 65.
Your license will be suspended soon.
But I still have some time.
Fifteen petitions are filed every day in Lucknow Court.
How long do you think it will take to file 65?
Are you threatening me?
No, I'm asking for your help.
"Wearing kohl, with your tresses entangled.."
"caress your heart with your hands."
"We are standing under your balcony."
"It seems we are stuck in muck."
"Gulabo.."
"shower some fragrance."
"Gulabo.."
Stop!
- OK stop!
Careful, uncle!
You had a by-pass six months ago.
The way I see it... I have only one daughter.
And I promised her mother-in-law that I'll dance to this song... and paint the town red.
Do you like this song a lot?
I like the actress in this song a lot.
Okay!
I've seen all her films many times.
She's a perfect blend of all our greatest actresses.
She is the best thing to happen to Bollywood.
After 'Saraansh'.

Yes, Mr. Jolly.
Sorry, I'm over-burdened... with my daughter's wedding preparations.
That's quite alright.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
Please begin, Mr. Jolly.
Mr. Fahim, please tell the judge here... everything you know about the Iqbal encounter.
Your Honour, I'm Fahim Butt.
- I was a head constable in Kashmir Police, Crime Branch.
Your Honour...
- Yes.

I have arrest warrants against..
..Jagdishwar Mishra aka Jolly and Fahim Butt.
The lawyer is accused of helping Fahim Butt escape from custody.
What the hell did you do in Srinagar now?
Lawyers have really outdone themselves these days.
- Right, Mr. Mathur?
Yes, Your Honour, this is really sad.
When the law is abused by its upholders then... it rips apart the very fabric of our society... and turns democracy into a farce!
I advise you to surrender immediately.
As for the case at hand... you can set any date, We have no objection.
Your Honour, we'll surrender to the Police... right after the court's over.
But please record Fahim Butt's statement.
I'm begging you...
I think you're expecting too much from me.
Please understand!
- No, I've tolerated you enough.

Don't be a drama queen!
- Don't make that innocent face.
Inspector, arrest him.
Your Honour, it will take only five minutes.
Take his statement and later...
Come on...
- Jolly...

Take him away...
- Listen!

- I asked you to take the lawyer away, not him.
Bring him back to the stand.
Your Honour, I've a warrant for both of them.
I know.
I know.
But Fahim Butt is a listed witness as well.
So let's record his statement.
You can take them both... ..after the statement's recorded.
- Right?

But Your Honour, can't we record his statement on the next date?
You see, Mr. Mathur, I'm on leave for two months from tomorrow.
It's my daughter's wedding, as you know.
I mean...
I'll send you the card, you must come.
I wanted to finish all pending cases before I go.
That's why my court's working even after 6pm.
But, Your Honour, he's escaped from police custody.
How can we record his statement?
He has no credibility.
Mr. Mathur, it will only take a minute.
Let's just record his statement... and get it out of the way.
Pardon me, but this not right.
- What you're doing is wrong, sir.

Don't teach me what's right or wrong in my courtroom.
Don't do it.
Frankly, I apologise... but what you're doing is wrong.
- I've heard about your Delhi escapades.
You wouldn't let anyone speak... you would do as you liked and behaved rashly!
Stop behaving like a dictator.

What did you call me?
You're calling me a dictator!
So you think I'm crazy.
Mr. Mathur, if I wasn't a heart patient... I would've shown you what a dictator is.
- Just a minute sir!
No, no, you try being a judge.
I can guarantee that you'll need a by-pass too.
Right?
Don't disrespect me.

Let's continue with the proceedings.
- Yes.

I won't let this happen.
What do you mean?
- Sir, this is objectionable.

Let's continue.

I'll handle this.
Don't try to prove me wrong.
Sir, if you force this...
I'll protest against you right here in court.
In fact, I'm protesting!
Here you go.
You're unbelievable.
- You're being childish!
I won't budge from here.
Don't sit there, they don't even clean the floors properly.
Please get up, Mr. Mathur.

I'm protesting and I will keep at it!
There is media here, doesn't that bother you?
Sir, let the media also see... how you judges treat the court like your personal fiefdom.
I'm not moving!
They can write what they want.
- So you won't get up?

Fine!
I will sit with you too.
Let the world see what these lawyers are upto!
- Sir?

Yes.
Madam, please move aside.
Hold the chair, please.
Give me a hand.
Thank you, Jolly.
Yes, Mr. Mathur.
Now we'll both sit in protest... and we'll see who lasts the longest.
Okay?
The events that occurred in the courtroom today... maybe one-of-its-kind in the history of our judiciary.
There was a heated argument... between defense lawyer Pramod Mathur and Judge Sunderlal Tripathi... regarding the statement of a witness.
And they protested against each other in the courtroom.
Now we have to see... how long these two keep at it.
Sir.
Mr. Mathur is brilliant!
He's been sitting there for five hours now.
And the amazing thing is... he didn't let Fahim Butt record his statement.
Now the judge has to re-convene on another day.
By then Jolly will no longer be a lawyer.
Sir...
Should we leave for Kashmir?
I have to go.
Take care of yourself.
The court resumes.

- And please maintain silence in court.
Your Honour, it is midnight, twelve.
You can give us a later date.
Mr. Mathur, what was your last date?
13th August.
So now it's 14th August.
Your next date is 14th August, 12:05 am.
Your Honour, it's midnight.

Even the Supreme Court works till 3 to 4 am.
We should follow their example.
- Please, sir..

Look, Mr. Mathur, you wanted to stage a protest... and you did and I said nothing.
Right?
You want to walk out, you can.
But Fahim Butt's statement will get recorded tonight.
Right?
- Jolly, record his statement.

Fahim...
Your Honour, thank you.
Fahim, please tell the judge what happened.
Your Honour, a few months prior to this encounter... we sent an intelligence report to Singh's team... which had the details of Kashmiri terrorist Iqbal Qadri, hiding in Lucknow.
Your Honour, just one day before this encounter... I was called here.
So I could verify whether the arrested man... was Iqbal Qadri or not.
- Your Honour, when I got here that man was getting married.
- I knew right away that he wasn't the right Iqbal.
But, Your Honour, Singh sir's team pressurized me... to say that Iqbal Qasim was Iqbal Qadri.
- I refused to comply and returned to Srinagar.
- I was really upset when I read the news about the encounter.
- I told my seniors in Srinagar...
- but they advised me to drop the matter.
- I tried talking to them, but they didn't listen.
When they didn't listen... I complained to the Central Agency in Delhi about this encounter.
I was pressurized again to withdraw my complaint.
But I didn't agree.
So they arrested me one day.
They filed fake charges against me and threw me in jail.
They even fired me from the department.
Thank you.
Yes, Mr. Mathur... would you like to say something, or are you still angry?
No, Your Honour... I wouldn't want to lock horns with you and destroy my career.
- But are you still angry?

But don't call me a dictator next time.
Right, Mr. Mathur.
I've grown old serving this court...
- and I think I deserve some respect.

Fine, continue.
Fahim Butt?
Will you please inform the honorable judge what the case is about?
What truth are we trying to arrive at here in court?
How did constable Bhadoria and Iqbal die.
In this long yarn that you've spun... does the truth about... who murdered them get revealed?
Since you weren't there at the scene of the crime.
No but...
- what's revealed is...

If you want to narrate more fiction then the judge is free.
- He loves filmy stories.
- I'm absolutely not interested.
Just give me a straight answer.
Yes or no?
No.
Very good, well done.
Fahim Butt, in August 2010...
Kashmir Police suspended you for six months for the Kupwara incident.
Why?
Your Honour, how is this question related to our case?
If there's no relation, then I'll stop practicing law.
I told you...
- I won't beat around the bush.

- You'll be direct, I know...

- May I?
Yes, otherwise you'll protest again.
Yes, so why were you suspended?
I was accused of a custodial death.
You mean you killed someone?
- No, I arrested him on suspicion.
We were taking him to the police station, for questioning.
He was scared.
He jumped out of the police van... and a truck crushed him to death.
So tell me, Fahim Butt... if fear can make a man jump out of a speeding van... then isn't it possible that... the same fear can provoke a criminal to snatch a gun... and try to escape?
Your Honour, he's leading the witness.
Objection overruled.
- Please sit down.
Yes, it's possible.
Then say it out loud, buddy.
We all know it's happened to you.
So you would know that this could happen to anyone.

Yes.
Very good.
Just one last question.
You just said you were suspended.
What were the charges against you?
I was accused of sharing confidential information with the enemy.
But that's a lie, Your Honour.
Your Honour, I was put behind bars... because I complained about this matter to the CBI.
You're saying that.
Your statement won't prove your innocence.
Your Honour, my learned friend forgets... that the accused is innocent, until proven guilty.
That is the point.
That's the damn point!
And, Your Honour, on the basis of this logic...
Inspector Suryaveer Singh and his team are innocent.
But let's read this newspaper for a minute.
Switch to any TV channel.
The media, society and the country... have already declared Suryaveer Singh guilty.
His reputation, his career, his future is finished!
And it's the irony of your court... that a man charged with treason is accusing a man... who has sworn to protect his Motherland.
Your Honour, many years ago... there was a bomb blast outside Allahabad High Court... where nine innocent lives were lost.
Amongst the deceased were my elder brother, sister-in-law... and my seven year old nephew.
My beloved father, Jugal Kishore Mathur... was injured during the same terrorist attack.
Yet he's here...
In the middle of the night, he's come here to see... which side you're on.
And, Your Honour, my question is that... is this court so weak that it's unable to decide whether the country... needs brave officers like Suryaveer Singh or murderers like Iqbal Qadri?
And, Your Honour, I would like to close by saying... that we may choose to be ignorant, live in our own bubble... but the truth is, Your Honour, that we're in a state of war.
And a learned man once rightly said... everything is fair in love and war!
And now, justice is in your hands.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Jolly, your turn.
I would like to question Singh sir first.
Singh sir, please step into the witness box.
Singh sir, will you please tell the court... who will win the next Cricket World Cup?
What kind of a question is that?
Fine, I'll ask something else.
Singh sir, can you please tell the court... if Aam Aadmi Party will win in the next elections?
Are you crazy?
Have you lost your mind?
Do you want to be shot again?
I'm a peace-loving man, Singh... but when in law college, a 6'8 "" inch guy provoked me... I punched him right here, and he was out cold for 22 clays!
If you don't believe me, you can ask Mathur.
Take it easy Jolly.
Calm down.

Ask questions but don't create a scene here.
He's calling me crazy and being rude.
Singh sir, why are you being rude?

Calm down.

Let's try that again, Singh sir.
Can you tell us when Salman Khan will get married?
- What are you asking him?
He's a police officer not an astrologer.
If he's not an astrologer... then how did he know that Iqbal would want to pee at precisely 6:45 am.
How did he know that when he would want to pee... the van would be crossing the Gomti river bridge.
How did he know that Iqbal would snatch constable Bhadoria's revolver... and try to run?
He wasn't at the wedding.
Then how did you get to the bridge?
Here, I'm right here.
- How did you get to the bridge?
- Coincidence.

Thankfully I was at the right place at the right time.
There are a lot of coincidences in your story, Singh.
Your Honour, I have a list of all his 25 encounters.
Such coincidences have often occurred in his life.
Just when the criminal is about to shoot... he arrives out of nowhere like a superhero!
And not just in Lucknow, but in other cities as well.
Your Honour...
Nineteen out of the 25 families of the encounter victims... have lodged complaints against him.
But not a single unbiased investigation was ever carried out.
According to a report from the Anti-Corruption bureau... he's believed to own assets worth 280 million.
But they couldn't complete their investigation either.
It was shut down.
And Mathur brought his old father out here on a wheelchair... to save a man like him.
I pity him and others like him.
I bow to you, thank you very much.
I bow to you and your advocacy.
Your Honour, he is besmirching... an honest and brave officer's character.
While you're silently watching.
Brave?
That's nonsense!
He shoots a handcuffed man in the back and you call him brave!
A man who earns a salary of Rs.35,000 owns millions and you call him honest.
- He's like termite.
He'll weaken the system, from the inside.
Show some respect!
Mr. Mathur show some respect for the country!
I can understand Jugal Kishor Mathur's pain.
A woman killed herself because of me... and I couldn't sleep for months.
But Mathur sir lost his son, daughter-in-law and grandson.
Only one man other than him can understand his pain.
Zahur Siddiqui sir.
Even he lost his daughter, son-in-law... and unborn grandchild.
Their pain is similar, Your Honour.
Whether I call him Jugal Kishore Siddiqui or call him.
Zahur Kishore Mathur it won't make a difference.
- Your Honour, two lives were lost on the Gomti river bridge that day.
One, the newly married Iqbal Qasim... and the other, was constable Baldev Singh Bhadoria..
..who was supposed to retire in 2O days.
And, Your Honour, this is constable Bhadoria's wife... who has lost her husband... and is doing the rounds of the court to get bail for her son.
What will you tell her, Mathur sir'?
"Smile, you're in Lucknow?"
The truth is bitter, huh?
Mathur sir.
Coincidences don't happen only with you, Singh.
I've the blessing of God...
Such a coincidence has happened to me.
I promise, this is going to be interesting.
Bring him in.
.

Sir, can I ask what's going on in this court?
And will you please tell me why you're letting this happen?
Who is this man?
How is he related to this case, sir?
We were given no advance notice or prior warning.
What is the relevance?
And you're allowing this?
Your Honour, if I had given prior notice".
then this witness would have been... buried in some deep, dark corner of a morgue.
I didn't bring this man here in fact, the police caught him.
And, Your Honour, this witness is directly connected to this case.
Inspector did you arrest him?
Sir, he is absolutely right.
This man is directly connected to this case.
If there's no connection then I'll have your job.
But, Your Honour, I'm right.
- Fine, I'll allow the witness.

- I object..

It's almost 3 am.
We won't find public transport at this hour.
We have to be here till 6 am anyway.
Let's hear out this witness.
I mean, it might be useful.
Please come to the witness box.
Hello, how are you?
You're all dressed up in your holy attire.
Fahim Butt, please stand up.
Please tell the court this man's name.
- Mohammad Iqbal Qadri.

- Mohammad Iqbal?

- Mohammad Iqbal Qadri!
- Where did you arrest him?

He has been hiding there since one year disguised as a saint.
That's amazing.
Your Honour, the inspector is lying.
- My name isn't Iqbal Qadri.
- I'm Ram Krishan Saraswat.
I'm a Brahmin and a monk.
I'm originally from Jammu which is why I have a Kashmiri accent.
But I'm not who they say I am.
This is my Aadhar Card and voter ID.
Om Prakash, please get those to me.
Go on, hurry up.
Your Honour, this man is lying.
- He confessed that he's Iqbal Qadri... in his statement to the police.
You have two stars on that uniform... and yet you don't know that any statement given... to the police is not admissible in court!
- This man is a trained militant.
- You're aware that making a fake identity card is not difficult.
And Fahim Butt has identified him as well.
Yes.
Sir, he's hiding his identity!
Your Honour, he's not hiding his identity... he's stating it.
How will he tell us his identity?
How else will he prove it?
You're Sunderlal Tripathi.
I'm Pramod Mathur.
He's Jolly from Kanpur.

Only through identity cards.
The evidence is right before you, sir.
There's no doubt.
- And let me point out to you, sir, that my... learned friend here has already presented a fake witness.
The Bar association has canceled his license.
In a few hours he won't even be a lawyer.
Please don't take him seriously.
I have a few hours, don't I?
You do.
So I can fight the case till then.
I can fight the case till then, can't I?
Jolly, please no fighting in this courtroom.
Mathur is right.
I think the police have made a mistake.
Sorry mister, you may leave.
Just a minute!
- Just a minute!

Stay there!
Just a minute!
Sir, I beg of you to let me question him.
It wasn't easy for me to get him here.
- Give me one chance!

- What did you just say?
What did you just say?
There's no public transport.
- Give me one chance.

- Be quiet for a second!

- Be quiet for a second.

- Fine, I'll allow the witness.

- What is this?

I think the court has the right to decide, okay.
And court has decided, please.
Thank you.

So you're a Brahmin.

Then you must know a lot about religion.
Of course I do.
Even I'm a 'Kanya-Gupch Brahmin'.
I have even been anointed.
So how about a religious discourse between two Brahmins?
Please ask what you like.
- Chant the Gayatri Mantra.
[CHANTS THE GAYATRI MANTRA]
Wonderful, now tell me your full name.
- Ramkrishan Premkrishan Saraswat.
- Religion?

- How many Vedas are there in the Hindu religion?
Four.
- Tell me their names?
Rigved, Saamved, Yajurved, Atharvaved.
Name the four periods?
Satyug, Dwapar, Treta, Kalyug.
- How many castes?

- Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra.
- What caste are you?

- What type of Brahmin?

- Which Gor?

- Clan?

- Classification?

- Ved?

- Sub-ved?

- Lineage?

- Family deity?

- Level?

- Sub-Level?

- What did you say?
- 'Allah"?
- What did you say?

I don't know.
- What did you say before that?
- What did you say before that, Iqbal Qadri?
Shame on you, Iqbal Qadri, shame on you!
You've even taken Allah's name.

You can't escape now.
How long will you live this deceitful life?
Shame on you!
At least speak the truth now!
Don't forget you have to face Allah on your day of reckoning!
Allah is witness to everything.
He will ultimately decide who is right and who is wrong.
I will have no regrets if...
I don't get justice today.
Iqbal Qadri, I could've asked for a DNA test... to prove who you really are.
- But I wanted to hear it from you.
- Tell the court your real name!
Your Honour, my name is Mohammad Iqbal Qadri.
- Singh sir arrested me.
- I was in his custody but he didn't present me in court.
- I knew he was going to kill me.
- One day I got the opportunity to tell him... that he'd get paid handsomely if he let me go.
- And he agreed.
- Where are you taking him?

He's leaving.
Come on.
- How much did you pay Singh?
Five million.
2.5 million advance and the rest after the encounter.
I object, Your Honour!
I've nothing else to say, Your Honour.
But I would like to answer Mr. Mathur's question... whether we need Suryaveer Singh or Iqbal Qadri.
Your Honour, we don't want either.
We don't want Qadris like him... who think killing innocent people is 'Jihad'.
But we also don't want Suryaveer Singh... who killed an innocent man and let a terrorist go free.
I salute brave and courageous policemen.
I bow before them.
But I'll call someone who's got an... innocent's blood on his hands... a murderer.
And you should be wary of such demons, Mr. Mathur.
If someone pays them then maybe the next coincidence could be you.
I would like to close saying... the world's biggest idiot said...
"all's fair in love and war!"
If that's true,... then those who behead our soldiers at the border are also right... and so are the jilted lovers who throw acid on young girls.
If that's true then Iqbal Qadri is also right... and so is Suryaveer Singh.
- Now you decide, Your Honour... whether they are right or wrong.
- That's all, Your Honour.
Thank you.
Once every few years we get a case like this... when I don't regret sitting on this chair.
- I come to the court every day.
- I sit looking at my watch.
Waiting for the clock to strike six so I can go home.
What to do?
It's the sad condition of the judicial system.
Take a look around at... these dark, stinking rooms that are our courtrooms.
Even judges like us don't want to be here... imagine the plight of the common people.
-Am I right, Mr. Mathur?
Thirty million!
More than 30 million cases are pending in this country.
And there are only 21000 judges.
That's one judge for a million people.
Dates keep piling up...
"ﬁght"
and people return disappointed.
But even then, when two people fight in India... what's the first thing they say to each other?
"l will see you in court".
- Why do people do that?
- Huh?
Because they still have faith.
Faith in the judicial system.
They believe that if the government... administration and police don't listen to... them then the court will hear them out... and give them justice.
So every person who sits on this chair.... has the responsibility to not break that trust.
All the witnesses and evidence presented in this court... clearly prove one thing.
Whatever happened on 14th August on the Gomti river bridge... was not a coincidental encounter... but a well-planned, well-executed murder.
And so the court, finds Suryaveer Singh and his accomplices guilty... under IPC section 302, 201, 182... and 340 for murder, evidence tampering... misleading the court and presenting fake evidence... and sentences them to life imprisonment.
And the court immediately orders the release of... late Baldev Singh Bhadoria's son, Ram Kumar Bhadoria.
The court is adjourned.
- Congratulations, Mr. Jolly.

Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations.
Thank you.
Please move!
Thank you.
- Thank you.

Thank you.
Boy, clean the dirt near the tires as well.
Scrape it off with your nails.
