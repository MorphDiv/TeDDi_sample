Listen Metin...
For a man to be able to die in peace he must at some point have planted a tree, written a book and raised a child.
This tree will give you shade when you're an adult, writing your book.
I never learned to write very well.
But you'll learn.

Now trample.
Was that hard?
No, you're the joy of daddy's life.
Get back!

Shut up!
My name is Metin Turkoglu.

Why?

A HUSTLER'S DIARY
Dad said to write a book, plant a tree, get a kid before you leave.
A wanky night.

Naturally I said I'd help them out.
They nicked a bag in town and I provided the smoke screen.
Ten big ones for a three minute job - now that's easy money.
That's a whole month's earnings for mum, and I get it in three minutes.
Earlier that evening, the Chinese truck had arrived with marmalade, macaroons, detergent, liquor, but above all our watches.
Rolex, Patek, IWC, Omega...
We'll be rolling in it this month, if you catch my drift?
Make no mistake, the Chinese know their thing.
I even heard they make false eggs, broccoli, tomatoes and rice, bro.
Is anything imported genuine?
Maybe my mates.

I swear, they went cash-free because of blokes like us.
Respect my car!
They were busted cause they bragged, but we know to always shut up.
If you open your mouth once... that's once too many.
Walking up the stairs on my way home one morning, I heard weird music.
At first I thought it was those potheads upstairs, but to my big surprise it was my mother, Fatma.
- Has this turned into a disco?

- Is that brat still asleep?

What's with mum doing the merengue?

You little brat, stay the fuck away from my book!
- Are Ali and Slim walking around with guns?

Sit down!

You and your gangsta mates nicked some school class's savings.

- Return them or I'll break your legs.

- So how will they get to the zoo?

Hey, you haven't seen this, you know nothing.

If anyone finds out about this book, I'm dead.

The money's gone, he says.
What's wrong with today's youth?

Dad must be turning in his grave when he sees how those morons behave.
I'm the only normal person in this family.
- So your cousins from Angola visited?

But it was nice.

The queue was too long at the Vasa, so we went to the Museum of Modern Art.
They thought it was super posh.

And it was the first time in my life that I saw Picasso.
Was he there?
You cretin.

Guess how much one of those paintings costs.
- 30 big ones?

- 300?

- 30 million?

But that's correct:

All we need to do is go in, grab it and leave.

That's actually pretty clever.

You moron.

- Relax, Metin, don't let them hear us.

- He has a point.

Picasso...

I'd like to pawn this one.
- Do you have the certificate and box?

Everything is in here, in original.
- I have to talk to my colleague.

- How much were you considering?

- Can I see your ID, please?

I can see that you've been here before.
- 30,000?

- Long-term or short-term loan?

Which bank and account number do I transfer the money to?
No, I'd like it in cash.
Thank you!
The watches are going like hot cakes.

But seriously, how long does it last?
Someone's got to take care of the family.
My stupid little brother will not do it.

Hey, Orhan!

Fatma, right?
I swear bro, I have to to do something else.

- Omar, how is your business doing?

- Wotcha!

- Omar may have a job for you.

- "No way"?

No, I'm not rude, I've got stuff brewing.
Your brother has attitude problems.

- You're giving sis to this dodger?

Tell you what...
I bought a new car.

A Porsche?

Stop talking like that!
- Take this to fill your car up.

- I work.

And he's got stuff brewing.
- You'll see.

I'll show them.
Dad will be proud.
Hello, Metin!
Fatih, listen.

Is this an interrogation?
Metin, how many cars did you set on fire?
Listen, I'm in a hurry.

- Bullshit!

Insurance fraud.

You take such risks.
I've done it a hundred times before, even for you.
Your problem is that you're too nice.

- Honestly, what am I even doing here?

I'll tell you why:

I tried to get a pram from my sister's car, but they park too closely.
One tiny wind burst and other cars burn down.
- It's not my fault.

Look at Norsborg, Fittja, Bredäng - not a single car fire in three months.
We have to stop scaring away the parking attendant.
Can I go?

Listen, we don't want any more fires here in this village.
- Okay?

Hey, wait!

Hello?

No, two minutes, not five, bro.

Excuse me.

- Oh, I didn't think he'd come.

- Didn't we cross him off an hour ago?

- You're three hours late.

I was at a hearing in the Turkish Society.

I happened to set a car on fire, cops came, kids threw stones.

But old people just waffle on and on, so I told them I had shit to do.

Wait a minute.

Yes, in Jordbro, so it took time to get here.

- Okay, but do we have...?

- Alright, let's do it.

To be honest, I read the letter you sent me, but I couldn't suss it out.
- We want you to act out a scene.

Right, I'll just take my jacket off.
You can start whenever you're ready.

Okay, I'll start with my back against you to set the right mood.
Get down on the ground now!

You fucking looser, I only have two minutes!

- Bro, didn't you think I'd find you?

- You never paid for the cab.

- 400 kronor.

A meter in a black cab?

- Oh, gosh!

I have a drivers license.

- Is this a joke, man?

Sorry, I forgot to pay that moron.

Get down, motherfucker!

- Thank you.

Can I ask you a question?

To be honest:

They speak so weirdly in Swedish movies, so this is something new.

I can see how your friends would like this, but this is a drama school.
The application form can be hard to understand if you haven't acted at all.
But for us to be able to fairly assess if perhaps you can attend this school,
- which is a three year commitment...

Then we want to see who you really are.
And that you express yourself through a monologue.

Have you prepared a monologue?
- Sure I have a monologue.

- Frankly, I don't know what that is.

- That thing I did, wasn't it good?

- Thank you.

What the hell?
I can hear the geezer's heart beat.
Unless it's my own heart.

The seconds are so short between his head and the concrete wall.
And any second now the coppers will be here.
Any second now his brains will stain the wall one shade lighter.
And I know it's time to leave, but I'm in the middle of my masterpiece.
I hear Aladdin shout: "Ey, duffer, the coppers are here!

"Coppers.

"Geezer.

Where is the dictionary...?

Listen: "Geezer is mostly used in areas with high immigration."
"Geezer means bloke, guy..."
"Mohammed:

"Ali:

Hey, wake up!

- No.

- Have you been in my room?

- It's...

Do you know what time it is?
- Have you been into my room?

- Have you tidied up in my room?

- Where have you been?

You reek of wine.
- Why isn't there any food?

- Börek?

- What do you do during the days?

What does he think I do?
This Fatih, have you been seeing him?
It sounds like it's getting serious between you two.

Omar, not one word to him about this.

That's because you've met a Turkish George Clooney.
- "Good day Fatih, how are you?"

Bro, it's Metin.

Could you take a look in the back seat and see if you find a black book?
No?

Why the hell did I mention everyone's name in it?

I wonder what's worse - if the cops find it, or someone around here?
Either way I'm totally fucked.
- Fatih!

- Tell me later.

- Have you seen a black book?

- This one?

It's a Swedish-Turkish dictionary and it's yellow.

What do we leave to posterity?
Cookery books, crime novels, gardening books...
We do have our climate drive.

And there's the upcoming book fair.

Was there more on the agenda?
Lena found this.
She liked it.

Lena, dearie...
Handwritten.
"04.45 - the loading dock, Jordbro."
Where did she find this?
- Who is this?

- Yes.

- Hey, what's up, Lena?

- Fuck, don't tell me I got in?

Everyone gets to do that first test and we don't give rejection feedback, because so many people apply, you know.
- Okay, thanks for calling.

- What?

I love you right now.

- I've read it.

And do you know, it's absolutely fantastic.

- Hello.

Have a seat, Puma will be right here.
- Would you like a drink?

- Sugar?

- A publishing house.

- Do you write?

Me too.
Metin?

- Welcome to Hollenbergs.

Thanks, you too.

- How did that go?

- Congratulations!

But that's cool, Al Pacino didn't get in either.
I read your diary...

A good basis for a good book that I would like to publish.
What?
I'd like to get it into bookstores.
Listen:

You can work here, wherever you want to sit, and I'll be your editor.
There's just one problem:

And you and me will end up shot in a rubbish tip.

Secret?

Are you retarded or what?

But it could free you up.

- I'm off to lunch.

- Thanks, Natalie!

Did you... eff her?
"Eff"?
- No, that's not really my... thing.

What's a secretary for?

Oh, dear...

I didn't mean it like that, my cousin's friend is gay and...
Metin, homo sex is da shit.
- You're a nuts, man.

Like I said, we'll work together.

Why would anyone even read my shit?
Because it's your story, from the heart.

I read quite a fair amount, but I hardly ever see anything like this.
- We already drew up a contract.

This is great literature.

It reminds me of my own youth.
Ours are alike?

It's not so much what you write, but how.

Life can end at any moment, but a book, it lasts forever.
We'll change all places, times, names...

- Do you think they're stupid?

- None, where I come from.

Look through the contract, please.

- Sleep on it.

But now it's Metin style.

- Where's my fucking book?

Anders Hollenberg, the CEO.

- Don't lie.

- Where does he live?

If he's not home I'll come back and fuck you...

What are you staring at?
Hey, hey, what's up?

Omar, are you making a salad?

- I'll just take a shower.

- I'm off to a banquet.
INCOMES OF THE WRITER ELITE
That's a shitload of dough.

- Learn to knock, eh?

- Don't touch!

- Maybe.

You can't wear a hoodie.

- What do you know?

Get out now.

- Can I borrow your car, bro?

Come on!

What's that?

- You should look into their eyes.

Oh my God.

A question:

- Metin!

- Is Anders here?

- I'm here to get my book.

- No, I'm in a hurry.

Have a drink, I'm getting some hors-d'oeuvres.
Please help yourselves, we can't save these.
- Bring a drink and I'll get him.

I'll put the hors-d'oeuvres over here.
- Yo guys!

- Anything new going on?

It's a sort of idea-based, satirical novel written in a documentary style.
It's about a man who has an extremely unusual idea.
Among other things he'll try to buy an army tank on the black market.
- What do you think, is it believable?

First, you have to pay in cash.

Also it's not like smuggling five grams of coke up your arse.

What do you mean?
My friend's Serbian family deals with these.

Russian?

Metin, Anders is in a Skype meeting, but he'll be done soon.
- But he says he hasn't got your book.

- What?

That's cool, Lena, thanks.

- Metin?

- Are you leaving?

- Wasn't it any fun?

There are some fucking weird blokes up there.
One bloke asked if I could help him to smuggle in a tank.

- Let's go to Jordbro and eat shawarma.

- Kebab, kind of.

No, I was there.

Got it.

Okay, give us a hug.
- Hey, what are you doing?

- I gave you a hug.

- See you later.

- See you.

- 0738...

0738 and then?

- Metin, where are you going?

- Did you turn your phone off?

So that's why!
Hey, where have you been, man?
- I tried to call ten times.

- Invite us next time.

- Does she have friends?

- Pretending to be a gentleman...

- Hey!

- There you are, bro, been working out?

- Alright?

- Listen, boys.

He did this job in Turkey with my little brother, cousin and Zigge.
When they came back they were hauled in.

- That's the way it works, bro.

- What will you do, cut him down?

- What's up, boys?

- Chill, man.

He seems serious about it.
- That little minx.

Call an ambulance!
Fucking hell...!
- Call an ambulance!

Call the ambulance...!
- The coppers are here.

I wonder if he made it.
Serves him right.

You have a point.
My uncle always says: "All leaking ships will sink sooner or later."
What if Yugoslav rats too?
Who will he rat on - his friends and customers?

Ali, that fucking snitch.

- Listen, I'm off.

Let's talk tomorrow.

- What did you see?

- And the shot came from there?

- Do you know who ran that way?

Look over there.
- So you saw nothing?

I thought it was children with firecrackers.
- It's not even New Year.

You're really cool with that thing in your mouth, aren't you?
- Aren't you from here?

Hi, Puma.

So why are you lying to me?
He says he never got it.
Hi, Metin here.

Promise, Anders.

Alright, but don't forget.

Bring it to the office, I'll come by in the morning.
- Hi, where's Anders?

You're joking?

But he's on holiday so I can't disturb him.

- How about Puma then?

- Cross with me?

I don't have my book, so please call him.
I can e-mail him to call you so that you can pick it up next week.
- Next week?

Sorry about yesterday.
But you can't give me signals if you don't want me to attack.
I didn't.
Nathalie, you eye-fucked me yesterday.

- I "eye-raped" you?

- Now you're doing it again.

There's a difference between the two.

I'm curious about your writing.
Puma says it's about self-experienced criminality.
Seriously, how do I get hold of the book?
- Do what you always do in the suburbs.

I bet there's a silent alarm, so five minutes tops.
Don't touch anything.

- What do you mean you know them?

Hey, come on!
Hey, didn't you hear me?

- Hey, do you think we work for free?

Relax, the coppers are probably there.
- Did you see...

You and your fucking paintings!

Hey, why don't you answer my calls?
I'm not stupid, you're messing about in Husby.
If you throw stones or burn cars I'll kill you.

You told me this morning it was a job.
I want nothing to do with this, let's throw the loot in a lake.
- We can flog it to Carlos.

- At least he has cash and stash.

I told you not to nick anything, now you've made everything worse.
That last job was good, we raked it in, but we were too few.
The next job is big, so we need one more and I'm thinking Metin.
Metin is good.

- Metin!

- What do you have for us?

- So I see. 20 big ones.

- So go to a fucking pawnbroker.

You're smart for a petty crook.

- 50.

40.
- You're doing well, aren't you?

I've been keeping an eye on you.

I'm guessing you pull in around half a million yearly.
The problem with making a lot of cash is that you can easily get enemies.
So Metin, I want to be your friend, okay?
I take 20 percent and you get jobs from me.
Well, I have plans, bro.

- Studying?

Why?
People kill and rat on each other, it's not like the old days.
"Not like the old days"?

No.
Don't forget who's let you work here in peace.

- Metin, are you okay?

40 big ones in three minutes, man.

"Study acting." Can you even do that in Sweden?
Come on, let's party like kings tonight!
Sorry, bro, I have to get up early tomorrow.
- I'm taking mum to a flea market.

Stop sulking, we're partying tonight.

How long do we have to stand here?
- Are you on the guest list?

- Sorry.

- That's not enough to get in here.

- Put them on something else.

You're not pulling out, bro, we're partying tonight!
Let's get wasted!
Switch your phone on, Anders.

This is no fucking game!

Pick up and give me my book back!
- You've taken something, I see it!

- I'm like this, I swear.

Nothing!

- Where have you been?

- Have you tried E?

Let me put it like this:

Let's do it then.
They work quicklier if you chew them.
- Where are you off to?

You okay?
30-40 MINUTES LATER
You're totally bonkers.

Don't be cross with me, bro.
The ship is leaking, bro.

If you can swim, that is.
I have to get my book back.
They took anything that rolls.

I'm telling you, anything.

Come on.

- What did I said about being out late?

- You're not like me, okay?

People look up to you.

- So you want to be like me, or what?

What?
Do you really want to be like me?

You wouldn't last for a day, man.

He bumped some bloke off for nothing.

Mum works day and night to be able to send you to a nice school.
Do you think this is a bloody game?
- I'm a fucking looser, got it?

People like you, brother.

- Mum must be worrying herself to bits.

- What do you mean?

Hey, are you taking the mickey?
- Don't you know?

She's seeing someone.
Hey!

The bloke from the society.

- Fatih?

- Why haven't you told me?

- Where have you been so late, Emre?

- I couldn't sleep.

How are you?
What have I been hearing?

- Don't play games, I see when you lie.

- About that I met someone?

- So what?

Don't I have the right to have something?

What about dad?

- Why should I be alone all my life?

Isn't it enough with me, bro, sis and Omar?
You know he and dad were friends, don't you?
You make me look like a fool.
I always loved your dad, but I can't join him in his grave.
Fatih?
- Metin!

- Where did you get that stuff?

- The stuff you gave to Carlos.

Half an hour after you left, the cops picked both that and Carlos up.
- Where did you get gold and watches?

- Why would I think that?

Listen, if I get to hear anything else, anything at all...
- That's enough, Erkan!

Until Carlos gets back, you and your gang go by my rules.

- Erkan...

That's not counting your whore of a mum!
What did you say?

What?
- Stop, that's enough!

- Enough...!

- Hey, whose fucking mum?

Why did I even hit him?
Why did I hit a little rat like that?
Because he said stuff about mum or because I'm a fucking moron?
I'm getting tired of myself.
And what do those inner city dudes think - that I'm some stupid wog?
They go Anders-Puma-Anders-Puma...

I'm better than this.
Get back!

- What did I do?

- Metin Turkoglu?

- Hands up!

- Keep still.

Shut up!

- Metin?

Get in.
- Is this a way to raise a child?

- Come on, admit it!

- I want to go home.

Why did you beat him up so badly?

- You were identified by Erkan Demir.

That's strange, you did time together at reform school when you were 15, 16.
- That was long ago, I don't remember.

For aggravated assault you could get 3-4 years.
No, I'd say attempted murder. 12 years.
- Listen, brother...

- We both grew up in Jordbro.

Remember the stones thrown at you?
- Yes, actually.

Who the hell is Puma Andersson?

- He's my boss.

- Yes, I'm a writer.

How nice, are we sitting here with the cultural elite?
Do you write German porn novels?
Now listen!

We both know that Erkan will beat you up out there if I let you go.
Or his cousin, or his neighbour...
Do you hear me?

You bastard.
You fucking cunt!

I'll fuck your mum, you fucking cunt!
Do you hear me?

God, how childish.

- Couldn't you have given him the book?

I'll make sure you get your watches back.
- Is that a new wine fridge?

- Hello.

- Are you a policeman?

- Is it a copper?

- Sorry, I didn't catch that?

Stop, before I hit you.

- Metin wrote a book, I'm his editor.

You must be mistaken, Metin can't write.
There's another Metin further up the street.
- Turkoglu...

- That's him.

Okay, thanks for telling me.
Hi, Puma, it's Metin.
No, I wanted to say about the book that I've reconsidered things.
Hello?

- You fucking cunt!

- Can I make another call?

A man is held in custody on suspicion of aggravated assault in Jordbro.
According to the investigators, the crime is gang related.
The police remain reticent on any further motives involved.
Phonecall, Metin.
Metin here?
Hello!
Awaiting trial?

Do you know when I'll get out?
No, but like I said, it wasn't me.

Get a job?

My son...
I missed you.
- Where's little bro?

- Or pack your things and get out!

You're not the father in this house, you're my son!

Fatih will take care of that Erkan business at the Turkish Society.
- I'll take care of it myself.

Don't you think I heard that you pay off my debt to Orhan?

Don't you think I know that you don't work?

I brought you into this world, not the other way around!
Try to understand this, will you!
- Think!

- Never you mind.

I'm not a snitch.
What did he say?

Are you proud of what you've accomplished?
- Would you like some tea?

The following happened:
Erkan insulted Metin.
He talked about Metin's mother.
Metin hit him on the head.
Erkan talked to the police.

The Swedish trial will take place within a year, but we must continue living and doing business, right?
So here, tonight, the real trial takes place.
Everyone agrees that in a year, in the Swedish trial, you will say this:
Erkan, tired after work, went in to Orhan to buy sweets for visiting relatives from Gothenburg.
On his way home, three Somalis wanted his mobile phone and wallet.
That's when they attacked him.
- Okay?

The compensation for the misunderstanding is 50,000.
Your honour, look at his face!

- 200,000.

I don't want his fucking money!
- 100,000.

- Give him the money.

It's everything I own, 110,000 kronor.

Count the money.
- Is it correct?

Now shake hands.

Come on now!

See you.
- Bye, gentlemen!

How the hell could you call the police?

We'll continue this at home.
Do you know what's sick?

When a guy says he'll kill someone, it's because his mates expect it.
So everything is just playacting.

No-one wants to kill, to get blood on their hands.
But they're expected to be that person.

Maybe you think:

But I do.

And I know that one of these days there'll be a bang.
The only question is how.
Puma, I'm telling you, I'll kill at writing this book.
I said yes.

This contract stuff is not my thing.
I was tricked once by a phone salesman, since then I don't trust anything.
- Do you have a pen?

Page two.
My mum said: "Metin, whatever you do, never sign a contract." And here I am.
Here are your contracts.
- Yes, but one is for you.

Oh, this is so good...

- It's just so good.

There you go.
You had it all along, right, you bastard?
- What are you waiting for?

- Start working by the desk behind you.

- 20 pages by the end of the month.

By the way, Anders wants his watches back.
- Can you see who it is?

You told me that the book was there, so in the end I had to fix it myself.
And the watches are gone, they're non-returnable.

And the gold is probably at some wedding...
Metin, can you hear yourself?
And regarding this video, we're the only ones who have it.

It's not as if I did a break-in.

That felt like my lunch cue.
Nathalie will be here.

Anything could happen.

I'm glad if I end up like Ali.

But I changed all places and names.

- So you think people here are idiots?

It's not that.

- I had to for our sake.

- Are you joking?

I'm not calm with this.

- It'll be alright.

- So you agreed?

- Forced you?

- I did it so we won't get busted.

- See you.

We'll solve this.

Fucking drama queen.
I'll talk to him later.

Yes, I can't be seen here, I have to lay low.
- How about the watches and all that?

Okay.
You know, I really never wanted this to happen.
So this book, is it Scarface, is it any good?

What do you think?

But honestly, between you and me, you say they forced you?
It sounds to me as if you want to write this book.

Tell you what, bro, I'm going now.

Bratte, I mean it.

Puma?
I've been thinking.

I can't stay at home now that...

No.
- You can stay with me, dearie.

- Are you joking?

Sorry about the mess.
Over there is the guest room, here's the kitchen, cleaner comes once weekly.
Here's the washing machine.

Jacuzzi, free to use.

Like I said before:

Like a ball rolling down a hill.

The feeling is that of a dopehead chasing for his next fix.
I wake up in the night from mum's crying.

I knew exactly what had happened.

A turning point. "I have to take care of mum and my siblings", I thought.
I guess that's when everything started.

I could kill you!
Metin, leg it!
- Why should I be alone all my life?

Fuck!
Mum works day and night.

- I'm a fucking looser, got it?

You're not a fucking looser.

Are you proud of what you've accomplished?
I love you.
Hey, man.

Honestly, Puma, I can't do this.

- Quitting?

- You can't do that, we invested in it.

No, I don't.

Is it writer's block?

Zoom out, "what am I doing?", go back to the source, find the smells, the language, blood, suburbs, criminal behaviour...
Criminal behaviour?

You know I don't think that.
I've told you before:

So made-up crime is better than the truth that I want to write about?
- What do you mean?

All of you fucked up my life.

- I fucked up your life?

People in the suburbs do petty crimes.

While the likes of you and your CEO fiddle with hundreds of millions.
Don't laugh.

- What did we force you to do?

- Hey, Metin, brother!

I know what makes a book sell.

I haven't forced you, I'm just your editor.
You applied to drama school and sneak around writing a diary for years.
I never forced you.
Why did you apply to drama school?

No, I'll erase the video and tear up the contract if you tell me what you want with your life.
Think!

Think about it.

- What the hell are you doing here?

- Nothing?

- You probably caused havoc, eh?

- There won't be any book, bro.

- I quit.

- Quit.

- Never mind, old Metin is back.

I'll forget it this time, cause we've known each other since pre-school.
- But next time you're on your own.

Anyone can make a mistake once, but it's still once too often.

- I hear you.

- Where are you off to?

- The pawnshop?

What kind of a question is that?

What's up with him?
Did you forget your ID?
What's happening, brother?
- Be good, boys.

ONE YEAR LATER
- Can I borrow your car tonight?

Why not?

- They give when you have a bike too.

It's in the bag, Nathalie.

He's crazy, that geezer.
- I'm looking for Metin.

We made a little discovery that we need to bring up with you.
It seems as if you pawned a few watches.
- Yes, one watch.

No-one complained until one bloke's watch broke.
What happened when he went to get it mended?
- It turned out to be a copy.

That made us look into the other 45 watches.
- And they were copies too.

- I must have been conned.

Excuse me!
This book signing will be over in half an hour.

Well, whatever you think, we're bringing this guy with us.
But...

So please just give me half a bloody hour.
Half an hour is all I ask, so that we can get this book signing done.
We'll take the backdoor, nobody will notice.
No, hang on, take the main entrance.

"Writer of A Hustler's Diary arrested at own book signing." It'll be a smash hit.
Stop it, dammit!
Great!

We'll bring him out through the main entrance.
- Please handcuff him.

Dad said to write a book, plant a tree, get a kid before you push off.
At least I've done two out of three.

AN EYE FOR THE CONTEMPORARY
- This book is smashing.

- Can I see?

He's written a fucking book and it's smashing!
Oh my soul.
So where's your book?
