We have his baseball jersey.
In here from little league.
When he played.
Texas, 2, daigle.
The experience of not knowing.
Where your child is.
And if he's okay,
It's really hard.
You can't sleep at night.
You're constantly looking.
I want to be very careful.
With what I say.
He started to turn into.
Somebody else.
Your mind goes to.
The most horrible places.
This was a repeated thing.
For 10 years.
I would follow him.
And then I would have to.
Explain myself to them,
"I'm not crazy."
I'm just trying.
"To find my son."

the last day that.
We remember seeing chris.
Was november the 7th.
My mom took him.
My mom said chris.
Was depressed.
And he was tired of.
Going to school every day.
And being told what to do.
Are you okay, chris?
He just wasn't happy,
And that wasn't like him.
A junior at.
High tower high school, 17yearold christopher daigle.
Was one of the popular kids.
Chris was tall, handsome.
And cute and definitely.
A headturner,
Always could make you laugh.
And the girls.
Most definitely,
They wanted a chance.
To be with him.
I'm trying to keep from.
Using "Smartass,".
Because that's the best term.
To describe him.
Teach.
He had this way about him.
To where he could, um,
Suggest something with a smile.
"Yeah, yeah,
That's a good idea."
and no one knows chris.
Better than his grandma wanda,
Who he has been living with.
Since he was three.
She could take.
Better care of him.
Than I could.
As far as financially.
She spoiled him rotten.
She got him motorcycles,
Fourwheelers, threewheelers.
Anything he wanted, he got.
She ended up getting him.
The k5 blazer,
Which he loved that.
She really.
Took care of him.
He loved his grandma.
But he'd have never left her.
Never.
The night after wanda.
Dropped chris off at school,
Dinnertime comes and goes,
But chris never shows up.
We thought he was.
Just spending the night.
With some of his friends.
And that he would just.
Come home the next day,
And usually,
If he didn't come home,
We didn't worry.
He was always.
With his friends.
The following morning,
There's still.
No word from chris,
And calls to his cell phone.
Go unanswered.
His family reaches out.
To his friends,
Starting with brittany parker.
Chris went.
To school that day.
And then he had come by my house.
For a little bit.
His state of mind.
Wasn't anything.
Out of the normal for him.
He left.
He went over to.
Our friend ashley's house.
He got a phone call that, "Hey",
You want to go do this or that?"
And he said yeah and he was.
Picked up by his friend, ricky.
Hey, hit my house first.
Got you.
And everyone saw.
A truck pull up,
The back of the truck,
And they took off,
And that was the last time.
Anybody saw him here.
Other than his friends.
His good friend ricky.
Says he and chris.
Drove to the nearby mall.
To hang out.
You going to hang out?
No, I've got to go.
You sure?
But ricky's mom called him,
Told him he had to come home,
So chris left with the girls.
I'll see you later,
Okay?
But no one knows.
Anything about these girls,
Not even their names.
Nobody seemed to know.
Where he had gone.
I never thought it would.
Happen to me.
Chris was always so much fun,
Always playing.
And running around,
And he was a daredevil.
He would try anything.
He didn't like.
The word "No."
He was going to do it.
Just to show you he could do it.
Definitely 100percent allboy.
He started.
Playing baseball.
When he was five years old,
And he was on select teams.
And then he went to high school.
And he played on high tower.
High school baseball.
Chris was very talented.
I was very, you know, happy.
And just always bragged.
About how good he was.
Heads up.
You know you only get.
Three strikes, right?
One, two, three,
And that's it.
Yeah, sure.
Bring it.
I mean, he was...
He was really good.
Chris would.
Dream about it,
Running and telling people,
"No, he's out at first base,."
And just I couldn't believe.
That he could have.
A baseball game in his sleep.
But in the summer.
Before his senior year,
Chris' major league dreams.
Are shattered.
There was an incident.
Where somebody threw a bottle.
And it hit chris,
And it hit the coach.
That was it.
Threw him off the team.
That was...
That was devastating for him.
That was, like,
Worldcrushing.
Yeah.
I'm all right, grandma.
Okay, honey.
You kind of saw.
This light in him.
And he changed.
He started to turn.
Into somebody else.
As much as he did.
After that happened.
He was hurting.
The following day,
Chris doesn't show up.
To school at all.
It wasn't,
Like, concerning.
It wasn't a big deal.
Okay, so he skipped school,
Or, you know,
He's doing something else.
He doesn't answer.
"That's not right."
I remember my grandma.
Calling me and I was just like,
"What do you mean, missing?
Like, he ran away?"
That's what
I figured it was.
Some of chris' friends.
Think the duffel bag suggests.
He was leaving for good.
When he lost baseball,
He was sad and he was.
Mad and angry.
- And he was like, - "I'm moving."
- I'm going to leave, - "I'm going to run away."
The mind in adolescents,
In 16 and 17.
Something minor.
In their world is huge.
And they feel like.
They can't handle it anymore.
To the beach for a few days.
He was just going to haul ass.
For a few days.
And then he would be back.
But according.
To chris' friends,
In the months after.
Getting kicked off the team,
His behavior changed.
I want to be very careful.
With what I say.
He started to.
Make some decisions.
That I know that he wasn't.
Super proud of.
He started to party.
A lot more.
He didn't care so much,
Because the one thing that he.
Really was passionate about.
He has no idea the trouble.
He is heading into.
People are crazy.
They are crazy.
You just don't know.
It was saturday morning.
When chris didn't come home,
So my mom called.
The police department,
And he would probably be home.
Well, he didn't come home,
So then she went.
To the police department.
And got them to take.
A police report.
And they were telling her.
That he probably just ran away.
Because he liked to go.
With his friends.
He would sometimes check in.
With his mom or grandmother,
But sometimes he didn't.
And he's going to.
Come back home.
Other friends think.
Something more complicated.
Had been going on with chris.
Ever since he got.
Kicked off the baseball team.
Four months earlier.
He didn't really know.
How to deal with it.
He didn't have.
The best coping skills.
Just because so many things.
Were going on.
But chris' family.
Refuses to believe.
He would leave without a word.
They just truly acted.
Like he just ran away.
And like I said,
He would never run away, never.
He might get mad and leave.
For a couple of days,
But he'd be back.
I went looking.
For chris everywhere.
He could have been.
Hit in the head.
And was laying in a ditch,
And it was cold.
I went around to the creeks.
And ponds and ditches.
I had poison ivy on me.
I made posters and put them up.
At the different stores.
And us going all over.
The place hanging posters,
For missing person posters.
"Have you seen him?"
If so, please call us.
"And let us know."
Kind of a waste of time,
You know?
You know what I mean?
I felt like, um...
In my mind, I was still having.
A lot of hope.
Who may have spurred chris.
To leave town.
I'd have to say
Chris and my dad.
Were probably the closest.
Out of all his kids,
Chris' parents.
Separate soon after he's born.
Chris wanted.
That perfect story...
The house life,
The home life you see on tv,
You know, where you have a mom.
And dad that love you.
He didn't care,
He's happy where he's at,
He'd done...
It killed him inside.
Chris' dad.
Was in prison.
For an extended.
Period of time,
So that brought a lot.
Of anxieties for him.
Inmate 46895.
Drugs.
It was always drugs.
He would go to prison,
He would be there for years.
He was just,
"Daddy loves y'all.
Empty promises.
As soon as my dad got out.
And got back into the life,
My dad was ripped out.
Of christopher's life again.
It was just.
A neverending cycle.
There's a thin line.
Between love and hate.
Just a few weeks.
Before chris disappeared,
From a texas.
State penitentiary.
When he was supposed to be.
Getting out of jail,
You know, I'm just tired.
"Of everything."
maybe chris ran away.
To avoid seeing his father,
But according to chris' family,
After his release,
His dad moves to.
Another town in texas.
As the days morph into weeks,
The urgency.
To find chris mounts.
Detectives did.
Everything they could.
They put flyers out,
They got dental records,
They obviously talked.
To the family a lot.
The kids at school,
They had to go talk to.
And interview.
He was in high school,
So you could imagine.
How many friends he had.
And who he hung out with.
I mean,
I'd probably say he's... some of the rumors.
Were that he went to missouri,
That he met somebody online.
One of them.
Was that he ran away.
With some of his friends.
To go to oklahoma.
Another one was that.
There was another friend.
That moved north somewhere.
And that he was with him.
One person.
Told me that, no,
That he had gotten into it.
With some bad group of people.
Or whatever in our area.
And they had gotten into it.
And so they had taken him.
Everything.
Grew and changed.
And it makes you crazy.
It... it makes you crazy.
A lot of different rabbit holes.
As weeks pass.
With no sign of the teenager,
Chris' family believes there's.
Only one explanation left.
Just that somebody.
Did kill him.
That's the only thing why.
He wouldn't have come home,
And that was always in my mind,
That somebody did kill him.
Who was his enemy?
Who would have.
Wanted him dead?
We kept his
Christmas presents.
We put them in a box.
And put them up in the attic,
We could give them to him.
It was rough.
I mean, gosh.
Grandma kept chris' room.
Just the way it was.
I mean, for the longest,
Don't touch his door.
Just stay out of there.
I want it just like he left it.
"When he comes home."
Because she was.
So close to chris,
And it took a toll on her.
As far as her health, too.
She deteriorated, you know,
From the worry.
And constantly looking for him.
And just everything she...
That's all she did.
While wanda never.
Stops hoping her grandson.
Will walk through the door,
Chris' mom and aunt are.
Convinced he's been murdered.
Who was his enemy?
He didn't have too many enemies.
Or who would not.
Want him around?
Somebody could have taken it.
Out on him, you know,
Through the drugs,
Through that lifestyle.
Maybe he was trying to do.
Something for my dad.
And pay off a debt.
To save my dad's life.
You have to remember,
Missouri city is.
Very close to houston.
Even though it's smalltown,
Has that feel,
Missouri city is not.
Void of gangs,
Not void of drugs,
Just like any other big city.
Look who's coming.
In the area by the school.
His friends said that, well,
He had said something to,
Like, the leader of it.
He said what.
Was on his mind.
And had a temper.
When he was mad.
So far,
There's no evidence.
To support any theories.
About potential enemies,
But chris' state of mind.
On the morning he went missing.
Suggests another.
Tragic explanation.
There were a couple.
Of conversations.
Where chris had talked about,
You know,
The idea of not.
Waking up again or, um,
Just disappearing,
Not wanting to be here anymore.
Because he lost such.
A large part of his identity.
When he got kicked off.
The baseball team,
You know, there were some.
Really intense times.
Where he was suicidal.
Didn't make sense to mom,
Because as a parent,
You want to find your kid.
You don't want that.
As your final answer.
I would sit at work,
And in the downtime,
I would go on.
The missing persons web sites.
And I would look for.
The unidentified bodies.
And see if any of them.
Could be him.
Were they male?
What date did they go missing?
Until you actually have.
That body and actually know,
You never lose hope.
You never lose hope.
Missouri city finally said.
That there was too much...
Too many different stories.
They couldn't.
Confirm anything.
So they basically turned it.
Into a cold case file.
And they just stopped trying.
To do anything with it.
You work it for so long.
If you have nothing,
You have nothing.
Where do you go?
What do you do?
His favorite color was blue,
And my mom collected blue vases.
And things and put it.
Around his picture.
I like the angels,
Like guardian angels.
Watching over chris.
That was her firstborn.
It's unreal,
The roller coaster of emotions.
That we had to endure.
During this.
In his work gloves.
And not baseball gloves.
Always wanted to be different,
Setting trends.
He said he could get.
A better grip on the bat.
Mentally and physically,
It took a toll on her,
And she changed.
We even.
Went to psychics.
But I would try anything.
To find my son.
She told us some.
Really interesting things,
They went down.
A long dirt road.
There were no lights.
There was a tree line.
There was an altercation.
Chris was shot.
In the head.
I asked the lady,
I said, "Where is he?"
And she actually.
Drew us a map.
She drew a picture of a fence,
And the tree was there.
And how the tree and fence grew,
You know, into it,
And it had been there.
For a long time.
And it was a low area.
And it was like.
Water would run through,
And she drew pictures of wheels.
And rims on the vehicle.
And we were going down.
Fence lines and whatever.
We found some bones,
Called the police.
It wasn't his.
They were animal bones.
And mom kept going to.
The police station and saying,
"Please, find out what happened."
To my grandson before I die.
"I need to know before I die."
but chris' mom is.
About to uncover a new lead.
From someone who was too afraid.
To speak up before.
She said that she had.
Heard something.
And that she knew something.
This is it.
We've... we've done it.
This is something big.
I did.
We'd sit with the front door.
Open and watch outside, too.
And it's like your life.
Stands still.
All you think about day.
And night is, "Where is he?"
Is he okay?
"Where do I look now?"
I made a promise that I.
Didn't care how long it took.
Or whatever I had to do,
That I was going to find him.
Of what may have happened.
To her son,
Tracie opens her home.
To other teenagers in distress.
And I was scared that something.
So I would let them.
Come and live with me.
And I would take care of them.
And help them.
In the fall of 2007,
Five years after.
Her son's disappearance,
Tracie takes in josh fretz,
A troubled teen a few years.
Behind chris in school.
I really didn't.
Know him that well.
He stayed maybe a week.
And a half.
And then one day he saw.
A picture of chris.
And I think that's.
When he took off.
Because I was worried about him,
And she told me that.
Something happened to him.
When he was 13 years old.
And he won't talk about it.
Tracie senses josh.
Knows something about chris,
But she never.
Sees him again.
More years pass,
But chris' mom refuses.
To give up searching.
For her son.
I took a job at a bar.
It was close by the house.
Because the kids.
Were old enough to drink,
And I thought,
"Well, somebody might get drunk,
Slip up, say something."
How are you two doing?
Good.
And try to make friends.
With those kids.
To see anything and everything.
That she could find out.
Where are you guys from?
From around here.
Every time someone.
Would come in from the school,
And one day one of the girls.
From school came in.
And she said that.
She had heard something,
But she didn't want to tell me.
Anything about it,
Just that she knew something.
I'm going to give you.
A phone number.
And she said that she would.
Talk to the detective,
And I felt that maybe.
Something could come of it.
The young woman goes.
Down to the police station.
And tells detectives.
What she knows,
Starting with the conversation.
She had with one of.
Chris' good friends,
Ricky mendoza,
Two months after
Chris disappeared.
With ricky mendoza.
And they got on.
The subject about chris.
And he said that.
He killed chris,
And she's like,
"No, you didn't.
There's no way."
He's like, "Yeah",
I'll show you where his body is.
"I'll show you."
So he drove down.
To this field and he pointed.
- He said, - "It's right over there."
The field that ricky.
Had taken her to.
Is in nearby.
Fort bend county,
But after an exhaustive search,
Police come up emptyhanded.
Nothing really.
Came out of it after that.
We felt like it was.
Another rabbit hole.
They didn't have.
Any proof of anything.
With no evidence.
Or testimony to support.
The woman's strange story.
About chris' friend ricky,
The case continues.
To languish.
A year later,
In the summer of 2010,
A new detective is assigned.
To look at the department's.
Cold cases.
What I liked about cold cases,
Number one,
Is bringing closure.
To family.
I couldn't imagine.
The wondering,
"What happened.
To my loved one?"
This one intrigued me because.
There were some leads in it.
Where it just seemed like.
It just dropped off.
And it wasn't followed up.
There was a statement.
From a female.
She said that she was.
With ricky mendoza.
And he was bragging that.
He did something to chris.
Detective robb decides.
The field the woman identified.
In fort bend county.
Deserves a second look.
So we called the texas.
Department of corrections.
And they brought.
Some cadaver dogs down.
And we ran two dogs,
And they had hits.
I thought we had something.
I thought, "My gosh."
Chris is buried here."
We cleared out this huge area,
Start digging up the ground.
Everybody was exhausted.
Because we weren't.
Finding anything.
You know, your hopes go on.
A roller coaster from,
"This is it,
We're going to find chris,".
To, "What are we."
Going to do now?"
When we went to the field.
And we didn't find anything,
We knew we had to start.
Going to talk to some people.
I figured after time expired,
That somebody would be.
Eventually willing to talk.
So we tracked down.
One of his buddies, joshua.
Now in his early 20s,
Josh fretz was one of.
Chris' many friends.
Questioned during.
The initial investigation.
We found out.
Where he worked.
And we went down.
To his job in houston.
And I talked to his boss.
Hey, josh.
Okay.
Josh fretz.
Is also the troubled kid.
Who briefly stayed.
With chris' mother.
So joshua comes in.
And I introduce myself.
And my partner to him.
That something's going on.
Josh was nervous,
Josh was scared.
Deer in the headlights look.
A little flushed.
Antsy a little bit.
We explained.
Why we were there.
I said, "Years have gone by",
And how would your family feel.
If they had no idea.
"What happened to you?"
His eyes started watering.
A little bit.
Joshua asked me, he goes,
"Am I going to get in trouble?"
I said, "It depends."
Did you kill chris?"
Joshua asked me, he goes,
"Am I going to get in trouble?"
I said, "It depends."
Did you kill chris?"
And he said, "No."
And I said, "Okay, then you're."
Not going to get in trouble."
So joshua tells me the story.
About ricky mendoza.
And the jealousy.
That he had towards chris.
Heads up.
This is the first time.
In all these years.
That police learn ricky.
Had a problem with chris.
Ricky and chris.
Played baseball together.
They were friends...
Two very different people.
Chris was very loud,
Could talk to anybody,
Was goofy, you know,
Laughed a lot,
And ricky was very stoic.
Just throw the ball.
He wasn't the allstar player.
That chris was, you know?
Chris had all the friends,
You know, he was kind of.
The chubby kid.
With bad acne, you know?
Only thing he had.
Was a cute girlfriend.
Josh said that
Ricky saw chris in school,
And chris was in a classroom,
And he was messing around.
Or flirting with ricky's.
Girlfriend at the time.
It made sense because
Chris was a big flirt,
But at the same time,
It would have been a joke.
Or it would have been silly.
From the stories,
Ricky was very overprotective,
- You know, - "I'm your boyfriend."
You're not going to.
"Talk to other guys."
I think that chris.
Had the personality.
That ricky wanted to have.
I think it ran on.
A much deeper level.
Than just.
Fighting over a girl.
According to josh,
On the afternoon.
Of november 7, 2002,
Ricky decides.
To get his revenge.
Ricky went to.
A house that chris was at,
Got him in the truck,
Got josh.
And another individual,
- And said, - "Let's go pick some mushrooms."
Let's go.
And they went out to this field.
And parked the truck.
He said they walked.
Around this pasture.
Josh said they were all looking.
On the ground for 'shrooms.
And ricky had.
His shotgun with him.
And he said he looked up.
And he saw ricky point it.
At the back of chris' head.
Ricky pulled the trigger.
He said he saw chris' eyes.
Roll in the back of his head...
And he saw blood,
And then chris was just.
Motionless on the ground.
- He said, - "We were freaking out."
We just started running.
"Back to the truck."
And when he said that.
So descriptive back then,
I knew he was.
Telling the truth.
Josh's story.
Is uncannily similar.
To the account of chris' death.
Given to his family.
By a psychic.
Eight years earlier.
Police track down the other.
Teenager in the car that day,
David garcia.
He's nervous.
I was like,
"What happened to chris?"
- And I was like, - "You need to tell me the truth,
"Because I already know."
Okay.
So he tells.
The same story.
David gives detectives.
Directions to a wooded area.
To help hide chris' body.
The field is just 1,500 feet.
From where the girl had.
Taken them two years earlier.
So we're walking around.
And sergeant mckinnon.
Looks down on the ground.
And he sees.
What appears to be a bone.
Sticking out of the ground.
He was like,
"That looks human to me."
dna analysis.
Confirms the bone.
Belongs to
Christopher daigle.
We found bones,
A few bones.
We didn't find all of chris.
After all these years,
Detectives assume.
Animals spread.
The rest of his remains.
I think it was.
In early to midaugust,
My sister called me and said,
"Samantha,
They found chris."
And I, "What?"
It's giving me chills now.
She said, "They're arresting"
Ricky mendoza today."
We just both.
Broke down and cried.
Finally,
We're getting there.
It felt like, "Okay, finally",
Something has happened."
it was finally over,
And we could finally.
Quit waiting for him.
To knock on the door,
We could finally bury him,
And that'd be...
And just thank god.
That we were finally.
Going to have...
Justice,
Something for chris.
As the trial approaches,
The family now knows.
Why it took almost 10 years.
For the truth to come out.
Do you understand me?
"Or you'll be next."
when chris.
First went missing,
But nothing really.
Came out of it after that.
I was friends.
With ricky's parents,
So our families have known.
Each other for a long time.
It's just something.
You didn't expect.
In february of 2013,
Ricky mendoza stands trial.
For the murder of
Christopher daigle.
Sitting through.
That whole trial,
It was like a living hell.
Ricky came in with.
A smiling face and,
You know, like...
It's 10 years already, dude.
Nothing's going to happen.
Y'all ain't going to.
"Get me now," you know?
He smiled, winked,
And blew a kiss at me.
Right then is when I realized.
He's coldblooded.
It's unbelievable.
That somebody could just.
Take it upon themselves.
And say,
"Okay,."
You looked at my girl.
I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to take you out.
"To this field and kill you."
after almost.
Two weeks of testimony,
A jury finds ricky mendoza.
Guilty of murder.
When they gave that verdict,
It was like
I could breathe again.
It was finally over.
Before ricky is sentenced,
Where chris' partial remains.
Were discovered.
We were all.
Going to pray and kind of have.
A little memorial service.
For chris.
And we're walking along.
And trucks had.
So there were ruts.
And I guess it had pushed up,
Or erosion,
And you could see.
Pieces of bone there.
So we started digging,
And the more we dug,
The more bones.
We started to find.
It still hurts.
That all that time,
He was so close,
Right there,
Just maybe four miles.
From my house,
And I had no idea.
That was hard.
I didn't realize that I was.
Going to be the one.
To actually dig him up.
My grandma wanda,
She passed away.
A little bit after the trial.
She knew, finally.
It was a little peaceful.
Knowing that they were.
Where I wish that.
He was still around.
To be able to call or,
You know, go have a beer with.
I just miss him.
I wish I knew.
Where chris would be today.
And what he would be doing.
A lot of things were.
Taken away from me.
But he's in a better place now.
And I'll see him.
Again one day.
