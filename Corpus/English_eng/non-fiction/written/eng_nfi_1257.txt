I am you.
I'd like to feel what you feel... think what you think.
I want to suck every part of your body.
Nothing about you disgusts me.
- Recently...

- ...

- I could feel inside you.

You are me.
I am you.
I love breathing you.
So do I.
When will I get my gift?
What gift?
The one you have hidden there.
I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.

- Yes.

Yes, you do.
Give it to me!
No!
Give it to me!
Stop!
Don't open it yet!
- I'll kill you!

No!
Don't open it.
Are you sure you want to do it?
Yes.

I'm surprised.
I didn't think you were serious.
You said it too.
Yes.
- Forget it.

Are you sure?

Forget it.
Are you sure or not?
I think so.
Yes?
Yes.
It's over, don't think about it anymore.
What are you doing?
Undress.
Are you sure?
What's wrong?
Are you backing out?
No, I'll do it.
Undress.
I love you.
And I love you.
Don't force it.

Bye, love!
Stop it.
- Be quiet.

- Mom?

I forgot some papers, but I'm going now.
'Bye.
LOVING
- He's taking so long.

No, I'm sleeping at home even if it's on a scaffold.
- I told Pablo already.

- Or so good.

- And it'll stink of paint.

Laura, will you show us a photo of Carlos?
- You want to see Carlos?

- And so does your mother.

Look.
He's gorgeous!
That's at his grandma's birthday.
And what's that?
- A suckling pig.

- Have you invited him on Saturday?

- Are we going to meet him?

We want to go to an amazing place that Carlos knows.
Great.

A weekend.
- Who with?

Laura, we've been here three months and all I hear about is Carlos.
Why not meet up with people from school?
Or invite them on Saturday.

Juan?
His mother says he's coming for a few days.
Who's Juan?
- Her "friend" from the village.

- Oh, no?

- Look who's here.

- Well, are we all ready?

You bitch.
I don't like the view either.
But painted like this, it looks bigger, right, Merche?
That's true, it does.
- You see I painted the gray you liked?

It's turned out really well.
- It's kind of rustic.

Does it need a coat of something?
- Maybe a varnish?

You've just seen each other!
I'm so happy to have your semen inside me.
It's like you hadn't left.
I don't know why I couldn't control it.
Hey, don't worry, my period's due any day.
- I am you.

I can't talk.

I love you.
What is it, Dad?
- How was yesterday with the faculty?

Did you have Civil Law with Vazquez?
No, his assistant came.
Is there any concept you find particularly difficult?
No, it's fine.
Remember to say hello to Vazquez when you see him.
Sure.
The meat is wonderful.
Thank you.
APPRENTICE WANTED
CLOCK SHOP
Carlos!
- You skipped class.

Laura!

You left this on your desk.
- Thanks.

- See you tomorrow.

- Why bring it to class?

Hey!

'L' HAS A DICK
Marta!
- Can I have a word?

When you arrive somewhere you say hello.
Please.
Remember the bag I left behind and you returned to me?
Yes.
- Did you see what was inside?

- Did you look inside the box?

- Are you sure?

Hey, I didn't look!
Before you took it, was anyone else looking at it?
Is the interrogation over?
They're beautiful.
Hey, the other day I saw online that the fine arts tests are in June.
Yes, but it isn't so easy.
You have to go to an academy and be well-prepared.
Well, why not go to the academy and get prepared?
And if you're accepted, then you can decide.
Have you had your period yet?
Not yet.
Don't worry.

Don't joke.
Well,
- we'd save on condoms, wouldn't we?

And what about this?
What are you doing?
Get off!
Stop it!

- I'll get it.

- Hi, there.

Sweetheart!
- Hello, love.

- Hello.

- You look lovely.

What have you done to your hair?

- I have to cut it.

Don't mention my hair or my job interview.
I can help you with that.
I'm a hairdresser now!
No, seriously, I know of a job that might interest you.
We'll talk about that later.
Wow, the house is lovely!
It still needs a few touches...

It looks great.

- How is she doing?

Here's your gift, love.
- Can I exchange it?

You've changed so much.

- Well, where's the famous boyfriend?

- He's a friend.

The friend.

- Dad, don't say anything.

- Hello.

It's the friend!

- I mean, the father.

- I'll take those.

- Are you Merche?

- Hello.

- Here, for you, for the new house.

You know how to win over the mother-in-law.
I like him, Laura.

I'm Eloisa, her stepmother.
- But a good one, a very good one.

If they were for the mother-in-law, what do you have for my daughter?
- Dad!

Well, life's tough these days.
Thank you.
- How far along are you?

- Do you mind if I touch it?

Are you two thinking about it?
We want to, but Pablo travels a lot.
It's easy with the women in this family.
If you sneeze at them they get pregnant.
- Dad!

Well, is anyone missing?
- Yes, my cousin.

Here.
But you already gave me a present.
Carlos!
I love it.
- Wow, it's like an engagement ring.

- You've got good taste.

I'll get it.
- Anita!

- How are you?

Where's the birthday girl?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
What a beautiful place.
- It's lovely.

It's an amazing place.
With all the vegetation and palm trees it's like an African jungle.
I've heard of that place, it's like a tropical ecosystem.
It's amazing that it's in Spain.
- Less than 60 miles away.

- More wine?

- Can you camp there?

I don't know why we're talking about it.
Carlos, you should help me.
School is more difficult now.
You can't meet up during the week and then talk on the phone until all hours.
- Have you nothing to say?

You're doing very well.

Laura?
Marta?
The teacher was worried.

Are you okay?
Christ!
Look at it, please.

Neither can I.
What will you do if you are?

- No, I'll have it.

Are you stupid?
Look at it, please.
But, Laura, your father will kill you.
- They're divorced, he doesn't care.

She'll be annoyed, but she had me at 17.
You'll be cleaning up baby shit and missing college.
Do you want to spend another four years studying?
Fuck, Laura, you'll get a belly, you'll be like a cow.
You'll be the fucking joke of the school.
What do I care?
I'll have it in the village, like my mother did.
It's nice there.
On your own?
No, Carlos would come and I bet my mother would too.
Her marriage is shit, she hasn't got a job.
Two lines mean I am.
One.
It's just as well, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Come on.
Don't keep thinking about it.
Some of us are meeting at my house on Saturday.
I'll send you the address if you feel like coming.
- A pajama party?

You're an artist.
I knew you'd like it.
There's a guy in the street staring at us.
No, on the other sidewalk.
- Who was it?

Well, my ex.
He called and said he wanted to see me.
I told him I was with you.
But he kept insisting, so I saw him earlier.
The thing is, we'd taken some time out but we never split up.
And then I met you.
Then he isn't your ex.
He is.
What's his name?
Juan.
And when did you take time out?

No, two months before.
So you've been cheating on him with me.
Technically, yes.
If he hadn't appeared, would you have told me?
Yes, I would.
Carlos, I'd have told you but you were showing me the masks.
It's all right, really.
I'll tell you everything about my life, my boyfriends.
I want to go home.
Carlos, please.

Look, it threw me.

I'll text you later.
Carlos, please.
I'm coming, I'm coming!
Hello, love.

I was talking to your mother.

As a market trader.

You can earn a lot...
Laura!
Laura, love!
She's a slut.

But you never liked Pablo.
And him?
He's going to be a father and he sleeps with a slut?
God knows what he's given that baby.
Maybe they'll get back together.
I'd slit my wrists first, I swear.
I don't think it's such a big deal.
Really, I don't understand you.
I hate lies.
Why that expression?
I didn't lie to you.
What if I had been pregnant?
Why bring that up?
- What would you have done?

What would you have done?
I don't know.

I'm 18 and you're 17.
Thanks for coming, but I'd rather be alone.
He started touching my legs to take the ants off and he pulled my skirt up.
I was hysterical because I hate ants.
And he knew that.

In fact, he took a photo and said if I didn't undress he'd post it online and my parents would see it.
Fuck, that's lousy.
- How long ago was that?

The worst thing is that now, when I want to come,
- I think about him.

- Yes.

- I've never come.

You've never had an orgasm?
No.
- Have you tried with an older guy?

Don't be silly.
If you haven't screwed a 40-year-old, you haven't screwed.
Your turn, Lola.
What will I tell you?
Tell us about the first time you came.
No, something heavier.
Go on.
This summer, in a bar, I met an old boyfriend, and I went with him to see if he'd improved.
We were in bed, kissing and remembering the old days, and suddenly he said he'd do it from behind.
Wait.
Behind, like a dog, or behind-behind?
- Behind-behind.

He started putting it in... and at first, it was hurting a bit.
That's normal.
But suddenly I started liking it, a lot, and I came.

No!

It's like shitting inside.
You're filthy!
Just turn it off.
Your turn.
Tell us something.
I can't think of anything.
- Come on.

What?
The parcel.
You swore you didn't open it!
What?

Oh, that nonsense!
What?
I did a pregnancy test.
- Are you pregnant?

She didn't want an abortion.
- Seriously?

Well, tell us something kinky.
Yeah, filthy.
Have you never done anything very...?
In the village, don't you screw cows and things for fun?
Sure, since we don't have TV or the Internet we have to do something.
You have to tell us something real.
Come on, tell us something.
Come on, tell us.

I did something you couldn't imagine.
I've done everything.
Not this.
Laura... are you awake?
Yes.
Are you okay?
Yes.
I'm sorry that you're worried.
I'd like to be able to love the way you can.
Have you never been in love?
Yes, but I always end up suffering too much.
You're beautiful.
We're going to have fun.
Let's go to sleep.
Hello.
I left a message on the phone.
I was with Marta, from school, and two other girls.
You want to live your life?
Then you can pay for it.
Tomorrow you start looking for a weekend job.
Is that what you care about?
Have you nothing to tell me?
To tell you?

Leave the phone there.

- You want the phone?

Okay.
Take the fucking phone!
What about the fraud case?
- Was it true?

First, he makes an inter-community acquisition in which there is a tax on consumer spending that is also deducted.
When the merchandise enters the interior market, it has the output tax which gives the buyer the right to deduct it, but then he pays it...
Babe, are you okay?

Carlos, this is Merche.
- This is no time to call.

You can speak tomorrow.

Forgive me.
You forgive me.
If you'd been pregnant, we would have had it, I swear.
Excuse me.
If you don't want an apprentice, remove the sign.

No one has ever come in to ask about that sign.
How do I know you won't steal from me?
What?
How do I know you're not a thief?
I'm not going to steal.

That's no use to me.
Look.
I can leave this watch as collateral.

My father gave it to me.
Unpaid?
Monday to Friday, 9:00 to 2:00 and 4:00 to 8:00.
All right, come tomorrow at 9:00.
I couldn't do it, old guys don't turn me on.
Not even Matt Damon?
I don't know.

There's one I would do it with.
With her stepfather.
My stepfather?

I saw him on Facebook!
- You slut!

All right.

Erase that photo!
What was that?
- Show me the photo.

You barely inhaled.

- You go all out!

The problem with getting pregnant is that you're stuck with the father the rest of your life.
I'd like to be connected to Carlos forever.
- But he's gay.

Fuck!
Talk to him.

He isn't gay.
- Stop that.

I would know.
I like Carlos.

- It's possible.

Aren't you coming to bed?
No, I'm not sleepy.
- Is anything wrong?

I'll wait for you in bed.
What are you studying?
Math.
I was terrible at that.
I wanted to ask you a question.
Go ahead.
Look, I don't mind and I won't get angry.
I know that the day we moved... you slept with Carlos in your aunt's bed.
That's normal.
The bed is bigger and you're at that age.
It's okay.
On Saturday, did you use our bedroom?
It's all right, I won't be angry.
No.
Laura, I don't mind, and I won't tell your mother.
I was out all evening and I slept at a friend's house.
Why?
A friend's house?
That's why she's so angry.
Yeah, well.
- What will you do?

- I'd like you to explain.

You don't want a boyfriend who just repairs watches?
Look, you can repair watches or do whatever you want.
But you've got a lot of talent.
What do you know?

You could pass the tests.
What do you get from working on watches?
I like it.
And I have time to think.
I have to go.

So long.
Are you all right?
I'm sorry about Pablo.
Pablo?

To work?
I need you to do me a favor.
Pablo found... part of a wrapper from a condom
in our bedroom.
If he asks me again,
I'm going to tell him that I've spoken to you and that you and Carlos used the bedroom when we weren't here.
Okay?
Don't get all sanctimonious.
There's a party on Saturday night.
I'll be home late.
Carlos, sit down.
Your mother and I want to talk to you.
Vazquez called.
We know you haven't been in class for two weeks.
Did we put any pressure on you to study law?
Did we say anything?
No.
We said it was a personal decision.
If you've started law, you have to finish it.
I'd rather not do that.
- What?

Is it your girlfriend?
No.
This isn't a joke.

May I get up now?
Yes.
The cardboard, Laura.
It doesn't stop.
- What is it?

You know no one comes here.
Someone's there.
I'm about to come.
Laura, someone's there.
That's impossible.
Yes there is!

- What's wrong?

We have to keep hiding like dogs.
It's shit.
We have to do something.
Get dressed, go on.
Let's run away.
Let's go and live together.
- What are you talking about?

Far from this fucking city.
Right now, just the way we are.
I don't believe you!
- Seriously?

Look, I could work in a factory, or in the country.
Would you like to?
We could go to my village.
Let's go!

We'd be away from our parents, we could do what we wanted
- without explaining ourselves.

- We'd make love when we wanted.

You'll love the village.

We can't go there.
It's the first place they'd look.
You'll miss this term but then you can make it up.
Then you can study or do what you want.
I don't want to study.
I'll be working, so I can take care of you.
We could go to Medina del Campo.

- I've got a friend there.

We'll have a sound system and play music as loud as we like.
That'll have to wait a while, but we'll get it.
Run!
Wait!
- My green sweater is in your house.

But we're here.
Let's go now, come on.

I'll just get my sweater.
We'll buy another one.

We'll take the first bus.
It'll just take a minute.
Please.
Don't be silly.
Hello, love!
- Hello, Carmen.

Yes, but I just wanted to get my sweater.
No, come in.

I love torrijas.

Come on!

- Charo wasn't able to come today.

- Come on.

Carlos loves torrijas.

- I don't know.

I put the sweater in his closet.
Use the slippers, love.

And you can stay out as late as you want?
Yes.
I promised I'd go to the party.
- Hey, can I ask you a question?

Have you ever thought you might like boys?
I don't know.

That you're bisexual?
What's this about?
Some very cool people are bisexual, like Lady Gaga or Angelina Jolie.
What are you trying to say?
There are people who think that what we did on my birthday...
I don't know.
You should know.
And I do.
Come on, we'll stay a while and then we'll leave.
What people?
What do you mean?
Before you said, "There are people who think..."
Did you tell anyone?
- I don't understand.

- It's a figure of speech.

Come on, just for a while.
Hey!
- This is girls' night.

Let's go to the bathroom.
Hey, hang on, okay?
I'll be right back.

It stops you from feeling dizzy, stops headaches.
You can take anything, your folks won't know.
- What is it?

The thing is it works.

Don't give him anything.

Look, I take them from my brother.
He gets them for after his chemotherapy.
They leave you feeling like new.

- Sorry.

- Or do you want a pill?

Fuck, what are you doing?
Calm down, we'll be out now.

What a pain.
You're making a mess of that.

I told Alex that Susana fancies him and wants to screw him.
She'll kill you.
I had to do something about them.

- You're crazy.

- I'm wetting myself!

Mega-pain!
- What do you think?

- I'm going to get Carlos.

- We'll tell Susana about Alex.

Don't feel guilty.

Tell Alex what you like.

Tell him how you want him to undress you, to suck your tits,
- how to eat your...

I want him to be my boyfriend.
All right, to love!
To love!
Another one.
- Not for me.

- Where are you going?

Laura!
Where are you going?
- Have you seen my boyfriend?

When will you give me a chance?
I'd never get involved with you.
I don't want to get involved, I want to be with you.
- I'm back now.

Don't.

Who did you tell about what we did?
- What do you mean?

Carlos, please.
- Laura, you're here!

- This is Carlos, my boyfriend.

Alex, a classmate.
- Want to get some drinks?

Where are you going?
- Carlos!

- What's wrong with you?

I swear.
Go back to your friends.
What's wrong?
I'd like you to be happy.
I'm happy with you.
We need time.
I don't know who I am.
Or who you are.
Maybe I'm losing my mind.
Is it full?
One of the disadvantages of being a girl.
- I'll see you later.

Why?
You paint, don't you?
Well, I really like Boccioni.
The Italian futurist.
- You know him?

They say he was killed falling off a horse, but I think it was suicide.
My turn.
There's a room full of paintings with people who seem to look at you as if you'd killed someone.
Behind it is the secret door into the bedrooms.
That's cool.
I really like you.

I'm in love with my boyfriend.
Your ex-boyfriend, you mean, because he's left you.
No, we've taken time out to think.
To think what?

What have you done?
Fuck...
- Wait.

- It's nothing.

The fucking glass.
Don't ruin your scarf.

I'll go to the washroom.

It's just blood.
Stay here.

Where are you going?
- Look, I'm okay.

I'm okay, Laura.
You can't ride the bike like this.

- I'm okay, Laura.

Look at yourself, you're not okay.
- Let Alex take you.

Sure, I don't mind.
I wanted to take you home.
Do it for me, please.
All right?

Seriously.
- Alex, can you take him home?

- Alex, are you fit to drive?

The keys.
You're stoned out of your mind.
And I didn't make out once!
- What does that say?

We haven't had enough to drink.

- Can we go now?

- And when will I see you?

I'm here every Saturday.
Shit, the bus!
- 'Bye.

- Hi, there!

- Were you at Stusy?

- The '82 party.

- Who was the DJ?

What was the music?
Techno.
- Do you like techno?

It's not your style.
Do you mind sitting in the back?
- What was it like?

- Where have you been?

- It's a cool place, it was packed.

How come you left so early?
I don't know.

What's wrong?
Are you okay?

You'll never want to be with me again.
That isn't the question.

I'm going to date someone.
You're joking.
No, I'm not.
Who?
El Moro.
You are joking!
He isn't like you think.

Are you serious?
- Yes.

But he screws everything!
Can you keep your voice down?
If I date him you'll never come back to me.
It's only been two weeks.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
- What about me?

Just so we could sort things out.
- That isn't possible now.

It is.

- We're very different.

- Don't you love me?

Well, then?
I don't know.

And then I'll know what I really want.
I need to try.
Are you okay?
A bit dizzy.
We'll talk tomorrow.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
I've been thinking and it's best if you go out with that guy.
So you can appreciate what we have and know what I'm worth.
Thanks, I have to go.
And I wanted to say that you won't lose me.
- I will lose you.

- You'll never forgive me.

When are you seeing him?
- Let me go.

Are you going to bed with him?
Don't do this.
Tell me.

Tell me.
We're not children.
I know you're going to do it.
- Tell me.

When are you seeing him?
What does it matter?
Exactly.

I don't know, I don't know.
- Tell me, please.

All right.

Call me afterwards.
- No, Carlos.

- Call me when you come back.

FRIDAY, APRIL 29
You're fired.
- What?

You gave me the morning off.
Your father told me you're studying law.
So go back to your studies.

Wait.
Here.
You'll thank me for it.
Go and get dressed.
Grandma died.
I don't feel well.

I have some ibuprofen.
- Thanks.

Do you have some money?
Grandma is in room 7.
Hurry back.
AVAILABLE
OCCUPIED
- What are you doing?

I thought she was with you.
No, she's with another guy.
I understand.
I want to go away with her for a few days.
- You love her very much, don't you?

I think we just need some time.
- If we're alone, we can sort it out.

Laura is too young for such a serious relationship, and so are you.
You still have a lot of living to do.
We love each other.
There she is.
If she wants to go away with you for a few days, I don't mind.
You're late.
We agreed I'd call you.
What were you saying to my mother?
Did you do it?
I didn't even see him.
What's this about?
Are you seeing him tomorrow?
This was a bad idea.
Don't do it, please.
Let's go to the place with the palm trees.
We could go tomorrow morning.
Don't wait for me tomorrow.
I won't phone you, and I won't answer my phone.
Don't do it, please!
What's so funny?
- Are you sure I can go in there?

- Isn't it neat?

And this is the Chamber of Deputies, with representatives of the main royal towns.
And the clergy here are the scariest.
- They terrify me.

- Look at their faces!

They're looking at us.
And here's the secret door I told you about.
This leads to the bedrooms.
Wow!
- Did he really sleep here?

The fucking kings are something else.
Come here.
Lie down.

I don't think I dare.
Are you scared?
- What if it breaks?

Look.

El Moro is a bastard.
But don't worry, he dumps them really fast.
Forget about girlfriends.
With a good jerk-off...
Dickhead!
Pass me the joint.
- It's passed, you don't ask for it.

Listen, it's too bad about El Moro because he really puts on a show.
He never fails.
He takes them on a night tour of the parliament building, a private one!
And he screws them on the king's bed.
No way.
Didn't you know?
In the parliament building?
Yes.
A royal screw!
Nobody believes that.
He works weekends and studies weekdays.
Since he's a security guard, he gives them a guided tour, he shows them the paintings, all of that... and then he screws them.
The first time is always there.
He says they go crazy for it.
Don't laugh, he did your sister.
- That's a lie.

- It is a fucking lie.

Where are you going, dickhead?
Hey, where are you going?

It's an emergency, I have to speak to El Moro.

There's no one here with that name.
Well, it's a nickname.

Garcia.
Or Garces.

- What do you want?

He's doing his rounds.
Can you call him?
- If he's your friend, you call him.

Yeah, and you're drunk.
- Can you call him?

Please call him from that gadget.
- It's for emergencies.

- What's the emergency?

- Calm down, calm down.

- Move!

Get the hell out of here!
- Kid, you've better get out of here.

Moro.
- Moro.

What is it?
We had a jealous boyfriend here looking for you.
Yeah, very funny.
Don't be a smartass, listen to the shouting outside.
What are you talking about, moron?
Laura!
Laura!
Laura!
Laura!
Laura!
Do you want to go to him?
Laura, please!
Bitch!
Laura!
Bitch!
Bitch...
Emergency services.
There's a bomb in the parliament building.
Under the king's bed.
- It'll explode in 15 minutes.

She's so beautiful.
Yes, she is.
I was at the hospital seeing my sister.
It all went well.
I'm going back to the village.
I've spoken to your father so that you can stay if you want.
We'll find a college dorm.
Do you remember when I was seven?
I was very sick, I had a fever.
Dad had just left and you were very angry.
You told me that I should never marry until I was economically independent.
I don't know if it was because of the fever but I was really scared,
and I told you that I couldn't live if you died.
Do you remember?
I don't know why on earth I said
"economically independent" to a child of seven.
He hasn't come out for three weeks.
Maybe you can persuade him.
Carlos, my son, look who's come to see you.
Help me persuade him to apply for Fine Arts.
The tests are in June and he'll have to get ready.
Please.
Hello, Carlos.
I know you don't want to see me but...
I needed to say goodbye properly.
I'm going to the village.

I wanted you to know that you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
And that I'm very sorry that I hurt you.
How's El Moro?
That's over.

Know what?

When I held her I thought she was our daughter.
I love you.
I think I'll always love you.
Yeah.
It's true.
Until a good dick appears.
I think I did it to try to forget you, and so you'd forget me.
Did you fuck him?
Being with you was the loveliest, most romantic thing I've ever known,
and I regret telling the girls about what we did.
Did you come?
No one has given me as much pleasure as you.
You haven't answered me.
Look.
I did this so you'll never forget our story.
I had to redo it lots of times.
Did you come?
Yes, I came.
Sex with you is wonderful.
And I want you to know that my heart is yours and it always will be, and whenever you desire me you'll have me.
Now.
What?
I want to have you now.
Show me that they're not just words.
You want to make love?
Call it what you want.
Carlos, you're not well now.
That's why.
Maybe it would help me.
- Are you sure?

Will you give me a kiss at least?
I'm on the pill.
I don't want to catch anything.
You're not like this.
- Don't let anyone say otherwise.

Get on top.
I'll be back soon.
Faster.
I hope we realize we can't live without each other, and we can start over from the beginning.
Stop.
Please, don't forget me.
I'm sorry.
I am you.
I am you.
I am you.
I'd like to feel what you feel, think what you think.
I am you.
I am you.
- You are me.

- I could feel inside you.

- when I want to stop being me...

- ...so I can be you.

Nothing about you disgusts me.
I want to suck every part of your body.
I'd like to feel what you feel...
- I'd like to...

I'd like to feel what you feel, think what you think.
I want to suck every part of your body.
Nothing about you disgusts me.
- Recently...

- ...

- I could feel inside you.

You are me.
I am you.
