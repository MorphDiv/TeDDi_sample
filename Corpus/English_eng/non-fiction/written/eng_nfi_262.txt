Well, somebody's chipper this morning.
Oh... you guys were there all this time?
I didn't see you.
Yeah, we just didn't want to interrupt your morning routine.
Is doing cocaine every morning your routine, Frank?
Funny you should ask.
I'm selling it to the Jews in Boca Raton.
I'm telling you, they're addicted.
If I recall, Wolf Cola used to just be, like, a money laundering front.
Well, it was, but I'm selling it now by the truckload.
I mean, they can't get enough of it.
It's become the official drink of Boca Raton.
Why do you ask?
Well, just 'cause of this.
The group released another video today.

Preliminary investigations have revealed that Wolf Cola may in fact be an American soda company, although how and why Boko Haram has adopted it as their official soft drink is unknown at this time.
We'll keep you updated on this story as it develops.
Boca Raton, Frank?
Or the official soft drink of Boko Haram?
Whoops.
How do you confuse a city in Florida with a terrorist organization in Africa?
It's an easy misunderstanding.
It is if you're an elderly cokehead, trying to launder money through a dummy soda corporation.
This is bigger than cola, Dee.
This is gonna touch all of Frank's Fluids.
My God, there are other fluids?
Yeah, Wolf Cola, some Nip boba drink...
Fight Milk.
You've been selling that?
It's selling like crazy with the UFC guys.
Buying it like crazy.
Oh, my God, Charlie, this is huge.
And it makes total sense because the-the best bodyguards
And the best UFC fighters are former bodyguards, so bodyguards, UFC fighters,
We got to take control of the product.
L-let's get out there.
Let's-let's-let's mingle with these dudes.
Let's expand the brand, baby.
Fight Milk's back.
Found my go bag.
Dee, come over here and dye my hair blond.
Oh, no, it's very funny to me, actually, 'cause your life's falling apart.
Yeah, you really screwed yourself this time, Frank.
Hey, do you mind?
You're going down, too, buddy.
What?
Remember when you wanted all the power so you could get the puss?
I made you executive vice president of worldwide distribution.
Shit, but nobody knows that, right?
I mean, dude, I only wanted the illusion of power.
The-the illusion.
I never saw an ounce of puss.
Oh, this is a good day for me.
You're executive vice president of operations.
Yes.
Goddamn it, Frank, why would you lump me into this?
I got this, I got this.
We-we just need to face this thing head-on.
And we need to do it right away, okay?
Because we only have 24 hours.
This is why we had to wait for you to go to Bed Bath  Beyond?
24 hours to respond to this, okay?
If we don't, then Internet trolls are gonna control the narrative.
I don't know how we're gonna come back from dealing with terrorists.
Christ, Mercedes built Nazi tanks, okay?
And the Jews are still driving their cars around.
Floyd Mayweather beat the shit out of multiple women and he's the highest paid athlete of all time.
Well, what about the Catholic Church?
Yeah, no, they did sidestep banging kids pretty masterfully, but they've got billions of dollars at their disposal
here we go.
Fight Milk's in the house.
Time to stop eating your crow and start drinking your crow, everybody.
Hey, guys.
Turn off that Cancun, pussy ass, techno bullshit.
Don't play the c... the... the Cancun bullshit, Charlie,
We're the founders and creators of Fight Milk.
There's nothing like the feeling of another man submitting to your will.
Now that's power.
What are you talking about?
Okay, he's a bodyguard, though.
You know what, I'm gonna jump in here.
We're-we're a couple of crow enthusiasts who wanted to take the power and essence of a crow and-and we packed that into a delicious milk drink
I don't know what you guys are talking about right now, but I have heard of your stuff and Cerrone and Felder, they actually love it.
Cowboy Cerrone and Paul Felder drink Fight Milk?
Uh, this is for wiping yourself down.
Yeah, thanks, guys.
Uh, Mr. Cowboy, Mr. Felder.
Oh, man, we love your drink.
We just had some.
Yeah, man, I'd get up and shake your hands if I wasn't shitting my brains out right now.
So, Fight Milk makes you sick?
Makes you expel all body fluids.
Sweat, piss, and shit; we got these weigh-ins coming up.
Nothing cuts weight like Fight Milk.
Oh, you're using it to cut weight, huh?
Yeah, they should give you guys a Nobel...
Oh, I just puked on my dick!
Rock and roll.
All right, cool.
Um...
Yeah, water bottle.
For when you feel better, and...
And I think how we do that is soften their brand.
Fr-Frank, you want to change... the perception of a global terrorist organization?
We're just here to take responsibility, but for nothing specific.
All that matters is that consumers feel
You say you're sorry, and then you just move on.
No, Dee, actually, you don't say anything.
But you do have a very important job... to say nothing and stand behind me.
You see, audiences are gonna trust me over you because you're a woman, and, by definition, shrill.
Now, objectify yourself and humanize me.
Hmm.
And here to tell their side of the story is the team from Wolf Cola.
Guys, thanks for coming in.
Oh, well, thank you for having us, Chet.
We at Wolf Cola were as shocked and saddened by this news as everyone else.
Uh, this by no means reflects our ideals as a premium soda company.
We're a family-run business, and we really care about people's concerns.
Listen, the point is, we have heard you all, and we are working tirelessly to remedy this situation.
Well, not an easy situation, indeed, but handled with grace and aplomb.
And I want to say thank you to America...
And also, we're sorry.
We accept full responsibility for this heinous mistake, and please know that I am actively firing people as we speak, because I am the boss.
Bitch.
That's good to know.
Yes.
Next up, a heroic tale...
You know what, Chet, can I say something?
I think we've said enough.
I think... you got to understand that Boko Haram did not do 9/11.
Paris, that was done by ISIS.
I mean, there's mosquitos down there that are bigger terrorists than Boko Haram.
We're gonna take a break.
And the 24-hour news cycle starts again.
Way to go, assholes.
I am just getting eviscerated online.
People calling me a bitch, flat-chested bitch, pretty much everybody wanting to rape me.
You opened that door the second you apologized, Dee.
I like this rebranding idea.
You guys, the problem is, I just ooze sexuality.
Well, you ooze.
A real woman of power, she exudes no sexuality at all.
That's true.
I think we got to focus on not losing Boko Haram.
Frank, we're not going into business with terrorists.
Are you crazy?
Look, we need to get back on TV immediately and control the goddamn narrative.
Yeah, speaking of TV, we're gonna be doing a little controlling of our narrative, so you guys mind clearing out?
Yeah, this is now our set.
Or Internet.
Let's talk about women's bodies.
I like women.
It's easy for us men... we have four acceptable body types.
Skinny ripped, jack ripped, dad bod, and fat... if you're funny.
It's a landslide!
As we all know, women only have one acceptable body type.
Skinny, big tits!
New evidence is suggesting that all this science inside one crow's egg can scientifically make your breasts larger.
Watch the enzymes enlargify your breasts.
Aah!
Finally there's a crow-based protein alcoholic drink for you.
That's 'cause you're a stupid ring girl.
Really, I mean, between the three of you, we could be opening up a bakery with all the muffin tops I'm seeing.
I didn't realize he brought a laser pointer.
But the point is, you guys could look even better if you drank Fight Milk.
We're not into your weird diarrhea drink.
This isn't the dream that I had for Fight Milk.
But it'd be great if women also drank it.
The dream was to create a muscle-up energy drink
I think we got to get some more crows.
From dog fighting to finding a loving home.
Amazing.
Now, who wouldn't want to adopt a little guy like this?
Well said, Mike.
Great story.
Now a local soda company is back in hot water with controversial remarks.
Returning to talk about it today is the team from Wolf Cola.
We are about making satisfied customers.
We do acknowledge consumers' concerns.
Yes, but we are not apologizing.
I'm just here to humanize him.
Support me.
Uh, Chet, we would also like to announce that for every can of Wolf Cola sold, a portion of the proceeds will be going to a charity that supports African people.
All Africans, even the... our friends at Boko Haram, because they are people, too.
Uh, yeah, look, Chet, if I may address the public directly?
Um, I assure you that we have righted this ship, and we are taking every step necessary to address all of your concerns.
We at Wolf Cola hope to be a part of your family's daily refreshment for years to come.
And we can say that without saying I'm sorry.
Well, Mr. Reynolds, it sounds like Wolf Cola has the right man in charge.
I thought we were done with the dog segment.
Well, if you're asking me if I like wild animals slobbering all over me, then, yeah, I guess I'm not really a...
See, I find that most people that are whining about dog fights are actually the same people going to football games and UFC fights, watching human beings beat the ever-loving shit out of each other while eating, uh, fried chicken.
No, I'm actually the opposite, pal.
I can't imagine a bigger waste of peoples' time and energy.
I mean, Chet, if you can eat fried chicken, then
I should be able to eat me some fried dog.
Yeah, and we're not doing so good, asshole, 'cause nothing's coming out of me.
My trash can's empty.
Yeah, we're scared to shit we ain't gonna make weight.
See, right now, you're crow loading...
Yeah, you drank about, like, four or five entire crows 'cause I'm grinding one up for every bottle at this point.
Yes, and it is that crow enzyme that's jacking you up, and that's why you look so beefy and so handsome.
So you start to puke everything out, and then you'll be fine for the weigh-in.
You're gonna be puking on your dick in no time.
Yeah, all I know is, we don't make weight,
I'm killing you both.
Yeah.
That one's got a real...
All right, let's bring out the first fighter, Cub Swanson.
Up next, the challenger, Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone.
Come on!
Yes!
I know, but if he doesn't, we're bolting, right?
155.
Yes!
All right, Cowboy, how you feeling right now?
Uh, just like to take the opportunity to thank Fight Milk.
Yes, and thank you, Cowboy, and thank you, Megan.
We'd also like to take this opportunity to announce that Fight Milk is now
Now if you're in...
No, no.
This is not the official drink of the UFC.
And I don't know who these guys are.
The nationwide hatred for Wolf Cola continues to intensify on an hourly basis...
Bye-bye, Frank's Fluids.
Turns out there are two things that can't be forgiven... raping children and disliking dogs.
Well, what am I gonna do with all the merchandise, man?
Fighters at a UFC event in Philly tested positive for several banned substances, stemming from an energy drink called Fight Milk.
We pumped it full of human growth hormone, you know.
Yeah.
I mean, just nothing else was working.
It just... it was just giving people diarrhea.
Starting to become known as the official drink of the UFC, this Fight Milk is a serious smudge for the group, and a potential public relations nightmare.
See, this is actually the one good thing about the 24-hour news cycle.
If you give it enough time, something new will come along to replace peoples' old outrage with new outrage.
Not much is known about Fight Milk, except that it's made right here in Philadelphia by a parent company known as Frank's Fluids.
Goddamn it!
Start the clock.
Yeah.
