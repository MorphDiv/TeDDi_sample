The dream is dead.
Say good-bye to the Schmidt Charitable Trust.
I don't know what that is.
But is that why you were throwing light bulbs against our garage?
- That was unrelated.

It's the foundation that I was going to establish to take the Schmidt brand to the next level, but now I can't.
- The name is taken.

Get a load of that.
The Schmidt Charitable Trust was established in 1948 by Cranston Schmidt, to promote nudity in restaurants.
Cranston Schmidt and his naked waitresses.
What am I supposed to do now?
How can I show my peers that I make so much money that I could just throw it away on strangers?
There is one way that you could maybe solve your problem.
- What?

What did you say?
You are not a frat boy drinking at a keg anymore, okay?
You are an executive now.
- You're a baller.

Also, I was never allowed in frats.
Too much hazing that required a visible penis.
- Oh, baby.

Like, who cares?
- How long have you been here?

Yeah, we keep the camera running all day.
I'm trying to keep Jess company while she's in Portland.
Yeah, yesterday I watched Cece read for a while.
Oh, wow, that sounds like fun, Jess, good for you.
- Cece...

She's still mopey over Nick.
I'm not mopey.

I'm gleaming the cube.
She's lying.

Ugh, Dad!
Ugh, I'm on the phone!
You're so embarrassing.
All he does is just recycle cans all day.
I wish his child bride would come back from Denver so he'd have someone else to bother.
Let's just get you out of this house.
- Yeah, right.

You're gonna sit on this couch all day long?
You'll get sofa butt.
Come on, let's go get some ice cream.
Ugh, I hate ice cream.

- Nobody hates ice cream.

- I-I feel uncomfortable watching this.

It's so stupid.
- Hey, Cece.

Hi, Schmidt.

Dad!

Achoo!
- Oh, you're up.

Hey, do you mind if I run something by you that's very personal, very hot button?
I do...

- I'm working nights this week.

No, Nick, as a prostitute.

Now will you please leave my room?
I'm very tired and I need to get some rest.
I understand, but here it comes, I have to tell you.
- I don't want to hear it.

- I swear to God.

- but I don't know how to.

Oh, now you're involved.
So now that you're involved, we need to talk it out 'cause we're basically partners in this.
- We're not partners.

It's just crazy.

- I was just driving down the...

- Reagan.

I worked all day.

Don't you want to catch up?
Yes.

What happened to you today?
I saw a seagull in the backseat of a moving car.
Can we have sex now?
Ugh, you don't get it.
Let's get it over with.
What does this have to do with me?
I was hoping you'd tell me how to break up with her.
Just pretend you're an adult...
- and get it over with.

Train's already left the station, Nick.
The longer you wait, the worse it's gonna get.
The train already left the station, huh?
- Yep.

You're welcome.
Hey, say, wake up.
Question.

Yes, Nick?
Do you think that looks like a monster's butthole?
I kind of do, yeah.
Yeah, me, too.

What's going on, Schmidt?
Man, are you having trouble ordering from that Jamaican restaurant again?
I don't know how many times I got to tell you.
Don't walk in there using their accent 'cause it's kind of racist.
The time has finally come for me to launch my own brand.
- Are you really not gonna turn around?

This brand will be my legacy.
And this is where you come in.
Ooh!

I'm going to start using my first name again.
Schmidt, I think that is a very bad idea.
I have no choice!
When I was born, my parents gave me a name.
Don't do this, Schmidt.
Ain't nothing but pain down that road.
It is the name that I was called for most of my life, and...
I want my name back.
Isn't this fun?
Remember, we used to come here all the time, every time you won a tennis match.
- That was your other daughter.

You-You were always in a production of Annie, but never Annie, though.
Priscilla, come here, come here.
I want you to meet my daughter, Jessica.
Remember?

She's the one that doesn't play tennis.
Oh, the teacher from Hollywood.
Well, two rum raisin sundaes and whatever my daughter wants.
You.
Her husband fell down a spiral staircase.
- What?

It was awful.

But when he found out that he had become a viral sensation...
- he killed himself.

I know how he feels.
Jess, are you still upset about Nick?
You got to, you got to move past that.
It's hard.

I do know what it's like.
- Ashley and I broke up.

- Yeah.

Yeah, about six months ago.
Uh, but I-I didn't want to worry you.
Dad.

Was it the 40-year age difference?
Were you tired of waiters just asking again and again if it was a daddy-daughter dinner?
Sorry, no, that's not...
You said that the pill sold itself, so let me ask you, is the pill a cure for a kick in the balls?
Because you're gonna need it.
- Oh, no.

Uh, I can wait.
No, it's okay, go ahead, I'm sorry.
I want to tell you...
- What?

Nothing came out of your mouth.
I feel like we're on a train.
Where are we going?
We're going to San Diego.
- What?

Let me tell you something, sister, your plan didn't work.
This wasn't my plan.
Well, you brought up trains, didn't you?
And you got in my head.
San Diego part?

I'm not engaging with you over this.
- So, what do we do now?

I've never experienced a person trying to break up with someone, and instead inviting them on a beach vacation.
I didn't do this on purpose.

- This is not on me.

You want me to go break up with her down in San Diego?
I don't, I don't care at this point.
- Why?

Because the weather is really nice?
And what happens if it doesn't work out?
I'm just gonna go move down to Mexico and start a new life?
No one's suggesting any of this.
You're a genius.
Thank you, Aly.
I knew I came to the right person.

That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard, and I feel like I should call San Diego to warn them about you.
But you seem convinced, so if it gets you out of here faster, God bless.
- Do you believe in God, Aly?

- Oh, this is hell?

Then why don't you stay out of my business?

That's all I'm trying to do, but you keep bringing me your business!
Ah, to hell with you!

- Fine!

- Go!

Don't say anything.
I should have known right from the start.
On our honeymoon, we're in the ocean, a-a-and Ashley sees a shark coming towards us.
You know what she does?
She pushes me in front of it and says,
"Eat him!

- What?

- That was a clue.

I'm fine.

Gets me out of bed in the morning.
- What if you met someone new?

- Really.

Dad, what about...
- what about Priscilla?

- What?

I'm an old man.

Look.

Not on the finger, the hand.
That is an old-man thing.
Okay.

Oh, no, no, no, no.
Hi.

Really, Bob?

Ha, ha, ha, you...
Let's do it.

Yeah, I have a new jean jacket I've been wanting to break out.
It's stone-washed.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, that was just about the cutest thing I've ever seen.
Even though this morning I thought you were married.
What about you?
I'm supposed to be cheering you up.
You did cheer me up.
You got me off of the couch.
It's good to be out of the house.
You kids have fun.
Okay, thanks.
So this is a surprise.
Where do you think we should go?
Where do you think we should go?
Look, Schmidt, we both know there's only room for one Winston.
And we found that out the hard way, didn't we?
Homecoming weekend, 2002.
- I'm Winston!

We can't live like this!
- Only one Winston.

Get off!

You'll kill him!
We have tried every single variation.
Fat Winston, Thin Winston.
Too derogatory.
Black Winston, Jew Winston.
Obviously problematic.
Hot Winston, Ugly Winston.
Now... that nearly tore us apart.
Which is why we came up with the one-Winston rule.
Yeah, but those were angry times.
Let's make it double W's.
Welcome back, Winston.
It's good to be back, Winston.
- San Diego.

- Where are we staying?

Maybe we're gonna get the nicest hotel in the city, huh?
Maybe you're gonna stay there, and maybe I'm gonna head back to Los Angeles today.
I'm gonna stay in San Diego, and you're gonna go back?
Who knows what's gonna happen down there?
That's the fun of a trip like this.
Nick, you would tell me if you were gonna murder me, right?
No, 'cause then you could prepare for it, you silly.
What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with me?

The guy taking you to San Diego... the Paris of Southern California?
- Okay.

I'm acting totally normal.
You need a drink just to chill out.
- What is wrong with you?

This stop, Anaheim.
You should have seen him.
The only time my dad gets that nervous is when he doesn't know where to print out his boarding pass.
It's so weird to think of him dating again.
- Oh!

What is that?

Oh, my God, my dad's boning!
- My dad's boning!

Get out of the house.

- Jess?

I mean, no, it's the cans.

Finish what you're doing.

I mean, everyone deserves to finish... oh, God!
Oh, cans!
- Can we talk about this?

I'm just replacing the sound of your skin slapping against someone else's with the sound of crushing metal.
I didn't know you were gonna be home.
I thought you were gonna be out having a day.
And you were supposed to be having coffee.
You just put out on the first date?
We had a connection.
I-I think I'm in love with her.
Oh, my God, I need more cans.
I got to have more cans.
Hey, you know, I'm a passionate guy.
- All right.

Well, I mean, you were nice enough to help me to move on.
Now I'm gonna see if I can find somebody for you.
Got it.

His son John.

Dad, put the Rolodex down.
Look, we're not in the same boat, okay?
I can't move on.

Nick?

I mean, he looks like the only white waiter at a Chinese restaurant.
There isn't a logical explanation, but it is what it is.
I love him.

- Come here.

I have to go to the recycling plant.
It closes in an hour.
From now on, I will be Winston Schmidt, and he will be Winston Bishop.
We are both Winstons.
Wait, your first name is Winston?
- Did I know that?

I have not slept in 36 hours.
Well, you should get some sleep.
- Isn't that right, Winston?

Sleep is very important.
It is the most important, Winston.
Okay, this is already too much.
In my head it wasn't this annoying.
Winston, why don't you just go by "The Bish"?
- I'm sorry, are you talking to me?

I knew she was talking to you.
- You knew the whole time?

Ooh, I couldn't tell.
Wait a minute, why does Winston...
- Yes?

Why does my Winston have to change his name?
- Schmidt, don't you have a middle name?

- It's Saint-Marie.

- And obviously I can't go by that.

Oh, hello, hello!
Wait, what are you doing here?
Oh, well, I couldn't break up with Reagan,
- so I jumped off the train.

- Problem, problem solved.

- Why didn't I know about this?

Well, actually, I'm Winston now.
I'm using my first name again.
Uh... actually there can't be two Winstons.
It nearly destroyed us.
Nick, hold up, can we go back to that moment where you jumped off a train?
Sure.

Okay, I don't care about the answer, but I feel like I got to ask, as someone who works in law enforcement... where is Reagan?
Well, she's probably getting off at the next stop, and then she'll be on her way here for some sort of a reckoning,
I would imagine.
"Problem solved" was probably a bit of a, an overstatement.
The good news is that I don't have to break up with her 'cause now she's gonna break up with me.
- Oh, Nick.

It's gonna be okay, Nick.

- Come on.

I meant "me Winston."
- I'm "me Winston," too!

Reagan's on her way.
I've got too much to deal with to deal with this two Winstons thing.
What, I can't have a first name because you left some woman on a train?
Don't put that on me, man!
I'm not calling you Winston, Schmidt.
'Cause if I do, then what am I gonna call the real Winston?
Call him I don't care!

- Hey, Winston, you want to get a drink?

- I'm down.

- Oh.

- Ooh, you know your boy hungry.

That time I was talking to this Winston.
- So, I can come if you want.

No, I'm trying to figure it out, okay?
Wait, time out.

They're both real Winstons, but the old Winston is now The Bish.
I'm not calling my fiancé "The" anything.
Nah, man, this is taking me to a bad place.
- I'm having...

Yeah, the two Winstons thing is not gonna work...

You've had Winston for 15 years.
It's my turn.

You will never be Winston.
- Oh, you want to dance?

Okay.
- Come on.

Come on.
- Okay, what is happening?

- Come on.

- Come on.

I had covered parking, I was happy.
- I'm Winston.

It's not about you, man.

Shut up!
I'll kill you!

I can't do this right now.
I got too much on my plate.
- I'm Winston.

- Nah, I'm Winston.

Yet, somehow, all the Michaels in the world manage to deal with this every day.
Mm-hmm.
Go to sleep, go to sleep.
- Hello?

- Is Jess there?

Can I take what I assume will be an idiotic message?
Ah, it's actually, it's kind of private.
Okay, fine.

Fine, I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

I'm, I'm in a really bad situation and Jess always says the right thing and I, I really need her.
Let me, let me ask you a question.
You're in the ocean with Jess, and a shark starts coming towards you.
- What do you do?

I-I don't know, Pacific.
- What type of shark?

Well if it's a hammerhead, you just tickle it between the sideways eyes and you have a companion for life.
Then you got tiger sharks, you got whale sharks, you got trumpet sharks, which I believe are a thing... if not, it definitely should be.
It's just a regular shark.
You know what?

Okay, vague premise aside,
I don't know what I would do, but if Jess was with me,
I'm sure...

She's got that giant heart that's, that's part compass and, and part flashlight and... she's just the greatest person I have ever met.
Bob?

It does.
Weirdly enough, it does.
But I also don't accept your weird-ass premise, man, 'cause it's absolutely preposterous...
- Nick.

Nick.
Nicholas, I can see you.
Hey.

Hey, so...

What'd you say to her?
Nothing.

I just, uh, crawled out from under the bed where I was hiding.
She said, "It's over," which makes sense, and then I came in here, and this is now my fifth beer in as many minutes.
- I'm impressed.

I once drank nine beers in five minutes.
I hear that cry for help, but I meant the breakup.
You ended a relationship without any confrontation.
You got what you wanted.
Then why do I feel so terrible?
Maybe you feel bad because your relationship with Reagan actually meant something to you, and you ended it like it didn't.
Right.
I'm sorry I put you in the middle of this, Aly.
But I'm also glad you were here 'cause I feel like we bonded.
It was one of the most frustrating days of my entire life.
I'm exhausted.
I feel like a single mom in a mop commercial.
Welcome to the loft.
Hey.
Taking a little trip?
I hear San Diego's lovely.
I regret that.
I'm sorry I left you on the train, Reagan.
You deserve better than that.
The truth is, is I wanted to break up with you, and I didn't know how to.
Okay.
I mean, I'm not mad anymore, more just... scared of what it must be like to have to live inside of your head.
Look, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I've been thinking about breaking up with you for a while.
So, we just wanted really different things.
I'm not good at good-byes, Nick.
I'm not good at good-byes either.
I think I'm gonna go stand in the closet for a little bit.
Okay.
- Okay.

Bye, Nick.
Yeah, bye, Reagan.
What do you want?
To be your friend.
If you need the name Winston... to get you to where you're going, then...
I'm not gonna stand in your way.
You're a good friend.
Uh, uh, what will I call you?
Well, I was gonna give Saint-Marie a whirl, but then I was like, nah, that's a girl's name.
And I thought about Two-Shoes.
- Two-Shoes.

But then, in certain shoes that I have,
I have three of them, so... so I'm just gonna stick with The Bish.
Come here.
Thank you, The Bish.
Thanks, Winston.
Hey, you know what?

Very weird.
Strange man.
I love Wednesday nights.
And this one's even more special, 'cause I got my name back.
I love you, Cece.
I love you so much, Winston.
Oh, God.
I don't like it!

- Damn it!

Take your name back.
I don't want it.
- What's wrong with the name Winston?

Worst name in the entire history of names.
What'd you say about my name?
Stop.

Come on.
Cha-ching.
Hey, hey, Jess!
Jess!

I-I talked to Nick.
- What?

It doesn't matter.

He and Reagan broke up.
And you know something?
I don't even think he realizes it, but he's still in love with you.
I got you, I got you!
I got you!

I'm gonna break it.
Aah, that's my arm!
I need it, I need it!
There she goes.
Off to college.
Circle of life.
Okay.
This is right.
I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna profess my love to Nick.
- I'm very proud of you, sweetie.

I'm proud of you, too.
You really just... humped your way right into things, didn't you, Priscilla?
- I kinda wanted the front seat.
