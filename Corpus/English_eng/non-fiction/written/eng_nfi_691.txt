It's not just a game for you, is it?
It's not just power and control.
It matters what I think of you.
He's playing with you.
And you're buying right into it.
Maybe it's in your best interest to make me think that.
You're gonna go to the rattlesnake everyday.
If that asshole riddler approaches you, you're gonna call me.
Were you home the night he went missing?
We don't exactly sleep in one bed.
She lied because she was pissed at him, which you should have been able to read.
Didn't there use to be an old mental hospital called New Horizons?
Sandy Driver.
A good cop died investigating that murder.
Did the same person who killed Jesse kill Sandy?
Yes.
I thought you were gonna sleep on stuff.
I know it looks crazy, but it's not.
I thought the murders were connected somehow, for a while.
Like a serial killer?
Not that she killed Sandy.
She has an alibi.
You know Maggie better than me.
You've hung out with her.
Talk to me.
She wouldn't hurt her son.
She's smart.
Smart how?
Book smart... high school awards smart.
Weird.
Like Tom, he had dreams.
And then the accident which was on purpose.
He and Maggie, both on paths till Sandy.
That's messed up.
Did your dad know all this when he was investigating?
I don't think so.
His memo books.
Whatever he knows about Sandy is in there.
I never wanted to look before.
Peter said I didn't wanna be in his head for his last days.
So don't.
But what if what he knew then, combined with what I know now...
I can find out what happened to Sandy?
It's worth it if I can figure out what the connection is to Jesse.
They said it wasn't big man-sized hands that strangled her.
I don't want you to think like that, okay?
All the time.
Go to bed.
Where you going?
Good night, Annie.
I need my dad's memo books.
The last one.
They're the police department's.
So is evidence.
Like that shack you burnt down.
There's nothing there for you.
You don't get to decide that.
Get them from Bev,
I'll sign off.
It's not pretty at the end.
His thoughts.
We're sorry, the number you have reached is...
Randy Oldring found her while walking his dog.
Found her on a concrete slab.
She was posed.
Her fingernails ripped off.
The victim was a message in a body.
Randy was shattered.
What is the significance of the fingernails.
This is where I found her.
I was up early walking the dog.
And we just stumbled on her.
You noticed the fingernails?
Yeah.
I couldn't tell if they were ripped off or... her neck was...
I didn't have kids because of that.
I broke it off with the girl I was gonna marry because of that.
Yeah.
You know, he just, he wanted to see how I was doing.
I thought that was... renewed my...
Thanks.
A girl disappears from a pageant rehearsal.
A large community event.
How was she not missed?
Photos from every pageant year.
Thanks.
Bethany!
God.
Come check the length.
Is Bethany playing Mary?
So Sandy went missing.
Dinner break.
You liked her, Sandy?
People weren't happy when I gave her the role of Mary.
She was here always on time, asking questions.
I don't mean like, you know "where am I supposed to stand?"
but you know, "what kind of a person was Mary?"
and "did she have friends?"
"Was she always beautiful or..."
"did she just become beautiful later?"
For a few minutes during lunchtime she was Mary and everybody had to love her.
To look at her I don't think she experienced a day of that in her life.
Mrs. Spencer, you know how I feel about grease and dirt.
She was never very biblical.
Need to re-interview the pageant teens.
Nobody knows anything.
Somebody's lying.
Date of last entry March 23rd.
March 22nd...
Where's March 23rd?
There's a page cut out.
March 23rd, 911 call.
Why would he rip it out?
911, what is your emergency?
I don't know, but I hit a tree...
I think it's his heart.
I'd say about... how long you been throwing up, Vern?
Someone was in my room!
Okay, I'm with you.
Is the intruder still in the house?
I don't know!
An officer is already on the way.
What's your name?
How did you know there was someone in your house, Lily?
Fingernails!
He left fingernails!
They are these migrating raves.
They pick a different building every week.
I've got investors coming through in the morning.
You see that woman over there?
Can you put her in a car and take her home.
How well do you know Mrs. Edmonds?
I just know her form the parties.
She comes every Tuesday.
Going back how long?
Okay, thanks.
Hey, you're a borderline hoarder.
Do you have a working VCR?
Hey!
Hey, I said a 12-pack.
Agh.
Do come in, please.
Rules.
And if you get too drunk to drive home and you sneak into my bed in the middle of the night.
"Ooh, your couch is so lumpy", that's consent.
You want me to sign something?
Sign right there.
Fair enough.
Have you ever ripped a page out of your memo book?
What the hell, Ryder?
Is this about Eddie?
What kind of shit is he getting you in?
It was my first year on the job.
And it was a DUI.
So I wrote him up as drunk.
Later on I couldn't go through with it.
So I tore the page out.
I almost got fired over that.
Why?
You got something you want to cover up?
Did you know Sandy Driver very well?
Weird how?
She never had any lunch.
And her clothes came from the dump.
When was the last time you saw Sandy?
I don't know.
What the hell, Ryder?
Did you know Sandy Driver?
What can you tell me about when she went missing?
I mean, I know she was there.
But I don't know when the last time I saw her was.
Were you and Sandy friends?
I don't really bond with people my age.
I guess I'm an old soul.
Well, something tells me you like trouble.
Is that right?
What else does it say on there?
Does it tell you where I live?
What kind of fun I like to have?
And that cop is into it.
Who's the cop Ryder?
You wanna tell me what the hell is going on?
No.
If I wanted to look up an old 911 call, where would I find the case file?
March 23rd, 1995.
March...
What does that mean?
Must have been a false alarm.
Your 911 call was never officially filed.
Mrs. Spencer?
What did you mean, when you said that Lily Mansfield wasn't very biblical?
I used to know her mom.
There was this thing.
Which is hard to do in this town.
What?
Abortion.
And apparently it was an older man.
Sit down.
This is my office, that's what I do here.
What's your name?
How did you know there was someone in your house, Lily?
I'm smart enough to know that you're not gonna tell me the truth and you're gonna try and play me.
But I know you know something about Sandy's death.
I see.
You're bored.
Your murder's solved.
Didn't go the way you wanted.
Didn't turn our town against each other for your viewing pleasure.
And I just want you to know...
I was in the pageant.
Just like everyone else.
You still got fucking fingernails.
I have a fucking alibi!
How's your stress level?
It's fine.
The door is that way.
I just came to get something.
It's my day off.
What's your name?
This is it, isn't it?
Why you didn't want me looking into anything.
Was something going on with him and Lily Mansfield when she was 16.
Did you know about the 911 call?
It was a nightmare, that's all.
He said fingernails were the answer then didn't report it.
She got fingernails.
He had to have known it had something to do with the murder.
He covered it up.
He didn't process the scene.
He made it disappear.
I watched his witness interview with her.
It was weird.
Did you check to see where Mother was the night that Sandy was killed?
But she's still involved.
Why, because some nut job left some fingernails on her bed?
You got fingernails too.
So I guess you're involved, right?
My garage got burnt down, I guess,
I, I, I did it too then?
And I know who else is likely involved, is virgin Mary.
Why are you on this anyway, Annie?
Because I think it's gonna help me figure out who killed Jesse.
The 911 call was March 23rd.
He declared the case inactive March 25th.
He found something that made him stop looking for the killer.
And then he went crazy, spent all his time at his fishing cabin
and that was it.
What happened between declaring the case inactive and his death?
I don't know.
I haven't been to that cabin since he died.
Don't go there, Annie.
I... need to make sense of all this.
I think whatever happened there is never gonna make any sense.
I wish you'd just let it go.
He's my dad.
Something about this whole mess sent him up there with his gun.
And he never came back.
I turned around, there's a few guys.
I don't know which one but it was the same voice.
They were talking about um... some mess they were in.
If anyone leaves, you follow them.
Why?
Because it's a beautiful day for a fucking drive.
Let's go.
Hi.
A few Tuesdays ago, there was a party at the old furniture warehouse down the street.
You probably heard it.
Ravers come here for water and things.
Do you remember seeing her that night?
You gotta stop growing there.
You're gonna be bigger than me.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Your mom hates church stuff.
I don't do everything my mom wants me to do.
I hate this stupid pageant.
I have to do it.
You know who would have liked to have been Mary?
She.
And just because she wore one dress doesn't mean she wanted to wear all the dresses in the world.
Jesse kissed me once.
As a she.
Can you do a debit card run for me?
Boring.
I thought it was gonna be something fun.
What's boring about that?
Number four to the mic.
I've been preparing for this mess all day.
That's the last one.
He musta slipped past me.
What's this about?
No idea.
Bringing in random guys from the rattlesnake.
What's the first sign of Alzheimer's?
_
The old mental hospital, New Horizons.
Can I get a patient list for that place.
Horizons has been shut down for more than a decade.
I can put in a request, but it'll take its sweet time.
Don't hold your breath.
Someone was in my room!
Is the intruder still in the house?
I-I don't know!
An officer is already on the way.
Did you see the intruder?
No!
How did you know there was someone in your house, Lily?
I've been prepping for this mess all day.
What does that mean to you?
You had the book.
What?
You ripped the page out.
Earlier you said that Lily had fingernails on her bed, but I never told you that.
It isn't in the recording.
Did you take the 911 call?
Was it you interviewing Lily?
Did you destroy evidence in a teenage girl's murder 'cause you wanted to fuck someone?
Is that why you're so desperate to find this guy?
'Cause he knows your dirty secret?
I can't deal with this right now, Annie.
My dad killed himself 'cause he couldn't solve this case.
Is that because of you?
No!
Then what?
So I'll need to take this pillow case to evidence as well.
I'll need to check for fingerprints and... bring the forensics team to go through the whole house.
They've been threatening to send me to boarding school and if they find out about this, they definitely will.
Please.
I mean, I'm sure they're not real.
Are they?
Wait.
Wait!
I know you like me.
During the interview,
I could tell.
Is that why you went there that night... to see her?
He just left.
Your mom was having a fit about something.
And then I, I, I went.
If he would have taken the call, none of this would have happened.
But I did everything I could, Annie.
I, I, I staked out Lily's house.
I put the pillow case through forensics, everything.
She had an alibi.
I looked everywhere for this guy.
She told you to, didn't she?
She did not know about that shack till you found it.
You're such a liar.
You knew he gave me fingernails.
You knew I needed that information.
This is my life... this person... and you knew shit.
And you sit here today and let me think that my dad had an affair with a teenager and it was you!
It means that I made a judgment call because I thought you needed somebody.
A surrogate fucking dad?
Annie get back here!
No, that's not how you're supposed to do it.
You just go straight in.
You're gonna burn it.
Flamed grilled just like a whopper.
She knows, it's like the slow roast.
You gotta go for the slow roast.
That's what I always say.
You call yourself a parent?
I can't believe Daisy made it to 12 without anyone showing her how to properly roast a marshmallow.
It was a joke, Annie.
Work okay today?
Can I have a beer?
Hey, baby.
Let me try.
Mom, they're burning!
They both... shit.
Here you go.
Can I speak to you for a second?
Take it, baby.
What's going on, Annie?
What?
Peter lied to me.
He's been lying my whole life.
Do you really think you should be here right now?
I wanna go home.
I wanna go home with our kid.
I need you to stop.
Whatever it is that you're doing.
Why?
'Cause you turn up at this fun, family fucking barbeque... like this?
I know, fuck, if she has one drink, if she has one fucking drink, the fucking shit is gonna explode.
And I used to like that.
I was the guy who took pity on those boring couples who wore cardigans and had supper at home and had date night and never had what we had.
That epic fucking cut yourself and bleed love, tormented relationship.
But I get it now.
What?
You don't have to feel pain to be with someone.
You don't have to drive someone to the edge of fucking sanity just to test them to see if they love you.
It can be calm and simple.
Fuck, Annie, I need calm.
I'm done with the crazy.
Well... you enjoy yourself.
How's it going, Annie?
It's fine.
What you don't understand is that he's pissed with me.
I don't know why I don't remember.
He's finding a temporary situation.
Some desperate girl who'll fall all over herself to be with him.
It's actually kind of like foreplay for us.
No more games, Lily.
You're lying to my fucking face.
And you've been lying to me for years.
What do you know about the fingernails guy.
Just come in.
Did you hear what I just said?
I said, tell me what I don't know.
Tell me what you fucking know!
I don't know who he is!
I let down the first guy who ever supported me, who ever cared about me.
He said that I was a good cop and he believed in me.
And then what did he do, he fucking shot himself!
And a little girl got ruined because of this.
No, that wasn't because of you.
How do you know that... he wouldn't have been able to figure everything out if he had, had all the information.
How can you compartmentalize like this?
You're fucking crazy.
I can't do this anymore.
The only time I feel alive is with you.
God.
The only time I'm real is with you.
And I know it's the same with you.
And if you don't think it's because of that first night.
"water tastes better because your fucking life is in danger" moment... you're fooling yourself.
You wanna go somewhere?
Where?
Agh.
What did he say to you?
Let's just go somewhere and get really drunk.
I just, I just can't be alone right now.
That's nice.
Real classy.
Hey.
Spend her money and toss her aside.
Same thing has been happening all her life, 'cause she won't stop betting on fucking losers.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What's wrong with you?
I'm gonna take Daisy home.
Come here, come here, come here.
My God.
It's not me.
The video's time-stamped.
It was taken the night Jesse died.
That means you weren't at home.
That means you can't alibi Tom.
It's my... it's my only release.
Now we have a secret.
It's not why I come here.
I don't come here to feel the adrenaline, the fucked up adrenaline of that night.
I come here because I deserve to feel this fucking low.
Annie, you still awake?
I'm gonna be gone for a bit.
I just gotta take a little trip to my cabin.
You know, it's where I go to think.
One day you'll see.
You'll look at yourself and your place in the world and... and you'll see you need to get away.
You need to go and think about where you belong.
And if you do good for the world or if you do bad.
If you're a force of light or if you are dark,
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fucking selfish!
Dad?
Come back!
Next Monday, a shocking discovery...
We're gonna have a problem here?
Not if you keep it clean.
Breaks the case wide open and leaves Annie fighting for her life.
