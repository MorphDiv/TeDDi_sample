Prescription Goggles over to Sweaty Headband Guy!
He passes it to Anakin Skywalker who drives the lane...
Come on, ref!

What happened?
- Skywalker got fouled.

What's the matter, ref?

My god.

- I didn't mean...

Miss Sinclair, my social studies teacher.

I get overexcited when we play Hartwell.
In the three years I've been teaching here, we've never won against them.

Are you here to support Liam, Jules?
Not just Liam.

Good job, guys, good job.

His effort is off the charts, honey.
- Mr. Shade.

Nice to see you again.
- Can we speak in private?

- Jules, you'll be OK?

Come on, ref!

Yeah, ref.

Please take a seat.
Only back at school an hour and already called in to the principal's office.

I understand you're now a private investigator.
A situation has come to my attention that requires a great deal of discretion.
Happy to help.

I received this anonymous email this afternoon.
Studentstud2000! "Miss S",
"I can't stop thinking about last night."
"That was just the beginning.

"we're alone, I'm gonna teach you how to..." Wow!
It goes on in some detail.
The message indicates this event took place last Thursday.
Wait, is...

Who's Mary?
Mary Sinclair.

- Jules' teacher?

And a close friend.

Protocol dictates that I should report this to the Ellard board immediately, but I can't do that to Mary.

Even a false one...

And destroy a school's reputation.
I need you to prove that this is a prank, in poor taste, before it turns into a scandal.

Alright, I'm on it, Ms. Frame.
And don't worry, my partner and I will be in and out before this thing explodes in your face.
That came out wrong.
All I said was Liam played a respectable game.
Yeah, and I can tell when you're fakeliking Liam.
You do that thing where you laugh while you're talking.
- I don't do that!

- Grandpa!

Good.

That takes me back.

Principal Frame just wants me to speak to some of the students.

Success.

- Please don't embarrass me.

- Dinner's on the table, sweetie.

- Speak to the students?

OK, fine.

- to look into something for her.

It involves her favourite teacher.

Then just don't be the one that does the ruining.
- Dad, I got this.

Yeah, I'm up.

Whoever you are... stand up slowly with your hands in the air.
- Zoe?

I thought for sure I was about to get shot.
- What are you doing here?

Today's my first day.
- I didn't expect you so early.

Did you know you're using the wrong coffee filters?
Figures.

Also, I restocked your desk with new supplies.
And I thought later,
I would take a stab at organizing your office.
- That will not be necessary.

There's a method to my madness.

Shade and I are going to be out a lot over the next few days, so just sit tight and leave things as they are.
Got it.

Shade emailed me the new case details.
Wow!
Hey, are you uptodate on new social media sites?
Yeah.

JDate or Ameechee.

Morning, partner.

Any lingering "todo list" items I can scratch off
- while you two are out?

The door to Angie's office sticks a little.
You could try to tackle that.
Don't worry about it, it's been that way forever.
Which makes the perfect thing for our new employee to fix.
Or to leave alone and stick to filing today.
Or not!

Copy that.
No.
It's just... weird knowing there's someone in the office when we're not.
Kind of comes along with the territory when you hire someone.
I'm just used to things a certain way.
Come on, this is a good thing.

Do you want to land the big cases or not?
How about we focus on this case?
Fine.

We find him, we can put an end to this character assassination attempt.
Unless it really happened.
You think she actually did this?
It wouldn't be the first time that a teacher hooked up
- with a student.

She's young, attractive, and human.
Some of her students are eighteen and, like it or not, teenagers have sex.
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
Hold on.
Here you go.
- What's this?

- so you're filling in.

- Yeah.

Well, you go undercover all the time!
And I can't do it, I'm too famous.
Celebrity can be a curse, you know.
I go undercover to blend in, not teach a high school class.
What am I supposed to say to a group of hormonal teenagers?
It's gym!

How does that help the case?
It's gonna give you time to suss out the mysterious purple website and look for signs of social media villainy.
And in the meantime, I'll talk to Mary and send you some names.
Next time, I come up with the plan.
Wow.
Wish my hockey coaches looked like that.
I sense that wouldn't have helped your career any.
OK.

All we gotta do now is keep a low profile, try to fit in.
- Mr. Shade?

Brie, from the column "Briefly with Brie".

How do you know so much about us?
Ear to the ground, finger on the pulse...
- How about a quote for my readers?

"If you don't know where you're going, you'll wind up someplace else."
Great, thank you.
So much for keeping a low profile, Yogi Berra.
Principal Frame, this is Angie, my partner, and your new gym teacher.
- Thank you for coming.

- Athletics building.

Do you have your own restaurant, too?
Yes.
There's a map in there, plus a list of your students.
You're in classroom 212, down the hall.
Classroom?
I...

The current unit is sexual education.
Don't worry, Angie's a pro;
It'll be the best hour those kids ever had.
Ahem!

- Sex Ed?

I'm way more qualified to teach that.
Stop it.

You're a sub!

Good morning, class.

Today, for... sex ed, we're gonna watch a video.
Does anyone know how to set up the DVD player?
OK!
Miss Sinclair.
Mr. Shade.

Principal Frame asked me to stop by and talk to some of the students that are falling behind.
That's kind of you.

- We're all just human.

- Is she doing OK in your class?

Jules is a great student.

- perceptive and engaged.

Last Thursday...
I had a doctor's appointment.
Gotcha.

Far from it.

I will, thanks.
Anyone I should look out for?
- I'm sorry?

Standing up there in front of all the kids,
I'm sure I'm gonna get eaten alive.
Marty Austin.

He likes to make his friends laugh by embarrassing adults.
- Look for the Bieber hair.

What happens if you wait until you're married and then you have sex for the first time and discover you don't like it?
You know, there's gotta be great communication and understanding.
- Hey!

Well, the room smells like bubble gum and Axe body spray.
- Where are you on the suspect?

See if he's in your class.

Got him.
- Might not be that great.

Marty, no texting in class.

Only if you put your number in there.
Ha ha ha.

We are really united with someone,
- does that have to happen?

Miss Everett?
- Yeah?

It happens.
O...

Does... anyone have any... questions about sex?
Dear...
How can teenagers still have so many questions about sex?

- Have you been on the internet?

- Never heard of it.

Did you find "Studentstud2000"?
That's the problem, it's members only.

You want my PeriWink login?

I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important, honey.
Important like sending Angie undercover
- as the hot sex ed teacher?

Yeah, you're trending.

Dad, what's going on?
I know you're not here as a guest speaker.
We're working a case I couldn't tell you about.
We have to keep it quiet.
So you lied and now you want a favour?
All we can say is that someone you care about
- at the school is in trouble.

Just sent you an invite.
- Thanks, honey.

OK...

No photo, no personal information.
If you're a teenager on social media, isn't the point
- to be seen and known?

- It's like a selfie freeforall.

Wait a minute, that's not right.
- Mary was set up.

Mary's account, and the account for Studentstud2000 were both created within minutes of each other on the same day they allegedly slept together.
And, Mary's personal information is all wrong.
It says she's been teaching here for five years instead of three.
You think one person created both accounts and manufactured the conversation between them.
Exactly.

- Why aren't you smiling?

- Who's that?

Is this your idea of a prestigious institution?
He's a teenager.

Let's go, son.
That went about as well as I expected.
I don't understand.

when the accounts are clearly fabricated?
That's for the police to sort out.
- You're involving the police?

Age of consent with a person of authority is eighteen.
Are you saying Mary could be charged?
I never wanted it to come to this.

That means informing the police and the board of directors.
What, so just when we uncover that the online messages are fake, this kid comes forward with an accusation?

- the timing's a little suspect.

But the only thing that will exonerate Mary at this point
- is evidence.

Well you better do it quickly.

I'll be asked to explain why I didn't report this incident immediately.

I suspect I won't be principal anymore.
No, no, no, stop right there.

You don't even know what we're gonna ask ya!
The Ellard kid, right?

- lesson from his teacher?

Can't help you.

His statement was recorded, right?

Angie, he's a minor, for cryin' out loud.

He's also a liar.

- is gonna be destroyed.

I found his story seemed a little fishy, but... what can I do?

- Zoe's gonna be so disappointed.

- Zoe?

- You hired her?

- She is going to feel so bad...

OK, you wanna see the video?

Pet names, phobias, astrology, yay or nay.
I'll give you favourite Starbucks drink, favourite movie, and any allergies.

Door.
OK now, if anybody catches you in here, you broke in.
- We get arrested for that?

Hey, Gail!

Just relax.

We met at this motel on Cawthra.
I made the room romantic.
Tea lights, rose petals.
Orangescented chocolate.

She wore a silver...
"negligee".
Come on.

- This is clearly rehearsed.

Mary told me she was at the doctor that day after school.
We confirm that alibi and she's off the hook.
What?

It sticks to your record whether it's true or not.
- Don't give up yet.

Your appointment, last Thursday.

I didn't go to the doctor's.
So, where were you?
At a protest.

- The packaged food company?

They built Ellard's gymnasium.
They fund the annual European trip for the graduating class.
If anyone knew that I was protesting against their genetically modified foods, I'd be in big trouble.
Bigger trouble than you're in now?
The irony is not lost on me.
Can anyone confirm you were at the protest?
Someone we can speak to?
Mary, if we can prove you were somewhere other than a motel with Josh, this can end.
Cooper Houser.

- Is he another protester?

He's the Chief Communications Officer for Pelican Foods.
Cooper Houser?
I... respect whatever religion you are, but no thank you.
We're private investigators.

- Cooper, what's going on?

Do you know this woman?

Yes, I recognize her.

You know the names of all your protesters?
Miss Sinclair has been very vocal against my company for the past year and a half.

- when she's organizing protests.

Everyone has a right to free speech.
Remember what time the protest ended?
- About 6:30.

Nope.

Thanks.
The protest ended at 6:30, Josh said he met Mary at 5;
Slam dunk.

They could have met up after the protest.

- they were up all night.

That kid doesn't have that kind of stamina.
We need more proof than a wonky timeline to get Frame
- and Mary off the hook.

Maybe somebody's pulling his strings.
Making a false statement is no joke.

Maybe they do.
Hey, Jules!

Jeez!

- Sure.

- it's... it's right here.

- next time.

Hey, Liam.
Evening, Mr. Shade.

- You always have sharp coats...

- and help me scoop ice cream.

Yep.
- Hi.

He went to bed.

- were still working the case.

About Miss Sinclair.

There's even an article in The Ellard Voice.
Sorry about that.

Now I get why you couldn't tell me.
Maybe you can help us, honey.

Well, I mean, no one believes it actually happened.
- Then why is he saying it did?

Could someone be threatening Josh with something?
Losing his athletic scholarship maybe?
He literally lives and breathes basketball.
When you're on scholarship, you have to keep grades up, right?

Calculus is his kryptonite.

- What?

I knew a guy named...

And Mark wasn't very good at math.
- Mark's whole life was...

No...

Or something...

Bought an old test from a former student
- to pass his class.

Hey, Mark was young.

If Josh did the same thing and someone found out about it...
They could use that information as leverage
- to get him to lie about Mary.

Hey Zoe.

- Yep, I can try.

I filed the crap out of those files.
Yep...
- You're off your game tonight.

- Hey, Miss Everett.

- He wasn't even in your class!

I bet you're being scouted by some pretty
- serious universities?

Shame to throw it all away over one stupid mistake.
What's that?
A copy of your calculus midterm.

Time to tell the truth about Miss Sinclair, Josh.
No!

- anything about the test!

Did someone threaten you?
They hacked my PeriWink account.
They found out I cheated..
And blackmailed you into claiming you slept with Mary.
I'll deny anything you say about me.
They'll get me expelled if I don't.
Who?

The ones who control everything at this school!
The Ellard Eight!
The Ellard Eight?

- Who are the Ellard Eight?

Back when Ellard was first founded, the eight students with the highest social standing supposedly... formed an elite club.
The idea was to bond them for life as they went on to become captains of industry.

Josh thinks it does.

- unless he accused Mary.

Is he prepared to recant his statement?
He's scared to.
Then there's nothing I can do.
The board meets tomorrow.

Ms. Frame...
- You can't give up.

I've had a good run as principal.

Good day.
We can't let her and Mary take the fall for this.
How do you find a group that doesn't exist?
Maybe they do and Frame doesn't know it.
OK, well, they're a student club...
How about we ask the students?
Hey, Zoe,
I think you accidentally locked the door to my office
- last night.

The Ellard Eight?

- So, they're real?

- Who runs the group?

But their leader is called "Number One".
Just like the Skull and Bones.
No, not like the Skull and Bones, Dad.
- It's a glorified fraternity.

- is a fraternity?

- Don't...

I'll send you some literature.

Why would The Ellard Eight target Miss Sinclair?
- What kind of a threat is she?

No.

Mr. Shade!
Thanks for inviting me onto the team.
You're not on the...
Thrilled to have you here, buddy.
- Did you bring the letter?

The Ellard Eight left this in my locker last term.

- so I wasn't let into the group.

Tunnel through to find the light."
There are some service tunnels under the school but I got lost in them.

It's pitch black in there.

Look.
Let's divide and conquer.

Actually, can I go with Angie?
Sure.
That means it's you and me then, Mr. Shade!
Fantastic.
So, how's school?

Yeah.

I'm... pretty sure your Dad would be willing to pick you up sometimes.
Yeah, but then Mom would get mad, and...

You alright, sir?

I'm a former professional athlete, Liam.
Let's keep moving.
So, I guess you have to do a lot of...

- when you go undercover?

I've never really liked the dark, I'll be honest.
But it's not like I think there's monsters or anything...
There aren't any monsters, Liam.
- I know.

- Sex.

I mean, do you... know about sex...
Do you know about teaching sex?
Where is this going, Jules?
How do you know if it's the right time?
- Boy.

If a crazy hobo serial killer comes after us,
I'll let him kill me first, OK?
- That's nice of you.

I bet Jules isn't afraid.

- Really?

It's not easy being a teenager.

You want everything right away and it's all... it's all right there, in front of you, so there's no reason why you shouldn't have it, but...
You don't have to rush.
Trust me.
Life'll still be there waiting when the time is right.
Now I see why everyone was so stoked for your class.
Me, I babble.

Would you like to hold the flashlight, Liam?
- Yes, please.

- No.

I broke the flashlight.
So it happened.
My phone's in the car.
OK, you do realize I'm blind, right?
I'm used to not being able to see.

Wait, there's air coming out of this wall.
I think there's a door here.
Shade!

Follow my voice!
Alright, I hear you.

So the Ellard Eight do exist.
Yet they seem about as threatening as One Direction.
Check it out.
These are all pictures of...

Nothing for this year.
Shade.

Cooper Houser.
CCO of Pelican Foods.
Mary was protesting against a former Number One.
Hey, how are you doin'?

- You're that cop.

- She's not here.

Yeah, that barista made an extra one of these by mistake.
Say, you wouldn't want it, would you?
It's a doublesweet, Venti, caramel macchiato,
- with extra foam.

- I can't stand that sweet stuff.

You're not actually a fan of the films of JeanClaude Van Damme either, are you?
Yeah, OK.

Can you keep a secret?
I think so, yeah.

I'd love to hear it.

Where are you taking me?
What the hell happened in there?
Angie's door sticks.

Opening the door made a hole in the wall.
When I spackled over it, I had to paint, so I moved the light sconce, which revealed faulty wiring, which revealed two light switches that don't actually turn anything on.
Hey!

- You know about repairs?

- I didn't mean that.

I need to figure something out before they come back.
You know what?

- My God.

Tell him, I will do anything.

You'll owe him one forever?

You really think this is gonna work?
Frame's meeting with the Ellard board in a few hours.
So, if Cooper's using the influence of The Ellard Eight to attack Mary, we need to rattle his cage before it's too late.
Here he comes.
My goodness!
- I'm so sorry!

- about walking and texting.

- Matt Shade.

With, Miss Sinclair?
We've had a breakthrough, actually.
We believe someone's trying to frame her.

- heard of The Ellard Eight?

Really?

- sits on the board.

I was wondering.

- doing at a protest rally?

- agree with the message.

Not unlike The Ellard Eight.

We find it, we'll find the person responsible for this.
Sounds like a wild goose chase.
If that goose fabricated a sex scandal to slander a teacher's character, then yes, that's exactly what this is.

Well, I... wish you two the best.
"Their goose is cooked"?
Yeah, I'm sorry, it just popped out.
Besides, looks like it worked.
He's lit up about something.
Let me ask you something, what's goin' on
- with you and Jules?

Don't get me wrong, I'm glad it's you and not of one of Becca's friends, but...
What?

What kind of things are you worried she's talking to me about?
I don't know.

- Personal things.

There's gonna be things that she doesn't wanna talk about with her Dad.
- Like what?

Look!

Maybe she figured out he's behind all this.
That doesn't look good.
No.
Cooper's wife's gonna have questions if she comes home
- and Mary's inside.

- we're cutting it close.

I wouldn't do that just yet.
- Didn't see that coming.

How long have you been seeing each other?
We met during a protest about a year and a half ago.
When Cooper found out I was a teacher at Ellard, he wanted to know why I was against Pelican.
After a few glasses of wine, we found a connection much deeper.
- Does your wife know?

- for some time.

- behind this?

- until it's finalized.

Either I admit to sleeping with Josh, which didn't happen, or I expose that Cooper has been sleeping with a protestor against the company.

Talk about a rock and a hard place.
I'm not proud of my mistakes.
But, I love that school, and I would never do what I'm being accused of.
- We believe you.

- isn't behind this?

- in that club for years.

Mary, I'm sorry.
Shade...
Why do you have framed articles from the Ellard paper?
My daughter wrote them.

- Miss Everett.

- Again with The Ellard Eight.

- You have the one responsible?

- It's a delicate situation.

- I'm prepared for the board's decision.

Better to resign gracefully than trigger an unnecessary war.
- Just give us the time we need.

Good, you're here.
The Ellard Eight were behind all of this?
Just the current Number One.

She?
Daddy?
Brie, what's going on?
They're saying you made up this story about Mary.
Honey, why?
She's been your favourite teacher for years!
I'm not stupid, Dad.
I know what's going on.
I saw your texts to her.
How could you do this to Mom?
- God.

- do this to my family?

It's mine.

- we didn't...

Yes.
We didn't know how to tell you.
We were waiting for you to graduate.
I just thought that... maybe if she was out of your life... you and Mom would stay together.
It was stupid!
I'm so sorry, honey.
We should've told you.
Mr. Houser and his wife explained everything to the board, including his relationship with Mary.
The police are dropping the investigation and Mary
- is staying at the school.

- I didn't offer it.

What's gonna happen to Josh and Brie?
Josh cheated on his exam, and Brie blackmailed him for it, then led a smear campaign against one of my teachers.
Not exactly model students.
- But Mary asked me to go easy on them.

They'll be suspended, but... officially, this was an act of The Ellard Eight.

Let me know if you'd like to sub again, Miss Everett.
I know the kids would be thrilled.
Um, I...

That won't be necessary, but...
- Thank you for your help.

- How is she doing?

- What did you say to her?

She slipped me this.
Looks like the Ellard Eight is gonna need a new.
- Number One next year.

- not Liam, right?

- make him my Number Two!

Very funny.
- Listen, about Jules...

I'm glad she feels like she can talk to you.

Well, it surprised me too, but, also,
- it's pretty cool.

- I would expect nothing less.

You've nothing to worry about, Shade.
You did a good job with her.
What are you still doing here?

- Zoe...

You fixed the door.
- It doesn't stick anymore.

I like things the way they are, even if they're broken.
Especially if they're broken.
But I must say... an unstuck door isn't that bad.
My God, I totally thought you were gonna fire me!
You know Shade's been on my case to redesign this place.
Maybe it's worth considering.

Your secret is safe with me.
So honey, I was thinking about Brie and her dad.
Is that how you felt when me and your mom split up?
It's weird.

I appreciate it, you know.

You're the strongest person I know, sweetie.
I'm turning on the TV.
Do your thing.
Extra Long Shorts passes the ball the Buck Tooth.
Buck Tooth heads down the court.
He passes it to Long Shorts for the lay up.
No wait, he fakes it.

Buck Tooth scores!
Woo!
